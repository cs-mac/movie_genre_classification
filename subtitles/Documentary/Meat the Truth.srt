1
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:35,037
Maya?

2
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:44,683
- Hey.
- Hey.

3
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:51,025
- Did you finish your reading?
- Yeah.

4
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:53,423
Most of it.

5
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:59,900
You know how everyone's complaining
about how dangerous the city is...

6
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:03,803
...and how they wish they could go back
to the good old days when it wasn't?

7
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:08,310
Well, it turns out there never
really were any good old days.

8
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:10,038
It's always been a hell hole.

9
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:21,957
You don't find me fascinating anymore?

10
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:23,624
What?

11
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:26,832
- Babe, are you all right?
- No.

12
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,693
- No?
- No.

13
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:32,029
Some Russian cabbie
jumped a curb today...

14
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:33,796
- Yeah.
- And knocked a pedestrian...

15
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,202
...through a storefront window.
I got there just as they were...

16
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:40,004
...loading the body in the bag,
and I thought I got the shot...

17
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,939
...something that the <i>Post</i>
would buy, you know, but...

18
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,415
- I don't think it's good enough.
- What if I had some good news for you.

19
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,953
You know, like news that meant
you could throw away your police radio...

20
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:54,888
...and only shoot the stuff you want.
Forever and ever.

21
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:58,087
I'd marry you.

22
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,424
That's it?

23
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,427
What else do you want?

24
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,997
Well...

25
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,364
...how about...

26
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:11,441
...you in a bed...

27
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:13,903
...not worrying about anything...

28
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:19,174
...for at least an hour,
except how to make me and yourself...

29
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:21,444
...really, really happy.

30
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:22,985
- It's a deal.
- Yeah?

31
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:24,713
- Yeah.
- You like that?

32
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:27,916
You like that? That's good. So...

33
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:32,523
You know how you're wishing
Jurgis would introduce you...

34
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,632
...to some of his fancy
art-world friends?

35
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,859
And you can never understand
why he doesn't?

36
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,767
Well, I called him today and I said:

37
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:41,768
"How come you don't introduce Leon...

38
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:44,636
...to any of your fancy friends?"
Do you know what he said?

39
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,903
- What?
- That he didn't do it...

40
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:50,947
...because he figured that
when you were ready, you would ask.

41
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:55,979
So I asked for you.

42
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,949
Isn't that great?

43
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:04,152
Do you know who Susan Hoff is?

44
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,662
Of course. You're kidding.

45
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:09,227
Do I look like I'm kidding you?

46
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:12,068
- You're meeting her tomorrow.
- Are you kidding me?

47
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:13,533
No.

48
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,642
Does my hour start now?

49
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:38,021
Whatever you do, don't mention Maya.

50
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,596
What? Why?

51
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:43,530
Susan likes her artists
young, male and single.

52
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,499
Actually, you know what?

53
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,538
The male part isn't that important.

54
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,747
Here we go. Come on.

55
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,107
- Hello, my darling.
- Hello.

56
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:04,049
- Sorry that we're late.
- Oh, don't apologize.

57
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,158
Punctuality means nothing to me.
It's a virtue for the mediocre.

58
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,528
You know when I first knew
that Basquiat was a genius?

59
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,358
When he was three days late for lunch.

60
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:15,500
So tell me about your work.

61
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:20,697
Explain it to me. What interests you?

62
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:24,206
- The city.
- Why?

63
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:28,073
Because no one's ever captured it.
Not the way it really is...

64
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:32,741
...the heart of it.
That's my goal, that's my dream.

65
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:36,411
Then you're failing.

66
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:47,822
You were at the right place,
weren't you?

67
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:51,932
- Yeah.
- But not the right time.

68
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:55,135
The image grabs our attention,
sure, but so what?

69
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:57,935
It's melodrama, arresting but empty.

70
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:02,976
I want to know what comes next. I want
to see the face of the businessman...

71
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:04,672
...when the filth touches him.

72
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:08,512
The next time you find yourself
at the heart of the city...

73
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:13,522
...stay put, be brave, keep shooting.

74
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,627
Then come see me.

75
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,834
- She hates my work.
- No, she doesn't.

76
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:32,169
When she hates somebody's work,
she gives them about a minute.

77
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:34,710
- You got three.
- So, what? She likes it?

78
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:38,179
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

79
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,620
You think she's right, don't you?

80
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,863
She's not.

81
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,635
Oh, no, no, no.

82
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,307
Time to pay the toll, baby.

83
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,271
Leave me alone, please.

84
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:19,543
Yeah.

85
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:29,779
- You gotta pay on your knees, baby.
- Hey!

86
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:39,527
What the fuck you gonna do, bitch?

87
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,934
Why don't you come
up here and find out.

88
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:44,534
What?

89
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:47,036
That's good.

90
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,829
Yeah, that's great.

91
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:52,942
All right, stop right there.
Right there. Stop. That's perfect.

92
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:59,644
Ever starred in a movie before?

93
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,532
Yo. Let's go.

94
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,053
Dead motherfucker.

95
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:41,891
You okay?

96
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,357
Thanks.

97
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:49,126
Most people would have ran away.

98
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:53,365
Oh, yeah.

99
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:54,698
I didn't this time.

100
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:56,568
Yeah.

101
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:21,098
Thanks.

102
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:30,532
- Hey, babe?
- Yeah.

103
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:31,930
You seen my purse?

104
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,737
- Yeah, it's on the chair.
- Okay.

105
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:41,212
When did you take these?

106
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,674
Last night.

107
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:49,484
You have to show these to Susan Hoff.
What you said she wants...

108
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,754
...I mean, this is it.

109
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,013
Yeah, you think so?

110
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:56,854
Yeah, because if it's not,
I hope I never see it.

111
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,087
Hey. Good morning.

112
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:00,788
Morning.

113
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:03,692
Babe, I'll see you later.

114
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:07,661
All right.

115
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,941
- Here you go, sir.
- Thanks, babe.

116
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:15,212
Hands off.

117
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,083
- No fucking way.
- Come on, one last time.

118
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:23,482
I said never again.

119
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:26,817
If I don't care that your disgusting
grease gets all over my tofu...

120
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:29,654
...why do you care that tofu
would get over your grease?

121
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,921
Because my customers, real Americans
with blood in their veins...

122
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:36,192
...they don't want their cheese steak
within a mile of a bean curd.

123
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,700
- It makes me wanna puke.
- They're never gonna know.

124
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:40,462
- I'll know.
- Tofu's tasteless.

125
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:41,970
- Now you admit it.
- Of course.

126
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:44,332
My gramps, God rest his soul...

127
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:47,740
Jesus. If he saw me do this,
he'd rise and make a sausage out of me.

128
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,973
Yeah, and your regular customers
would gobble it right up.

129
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:11,501
Maya.

130
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,106
That's the same girl, right?

131
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:17,498
She's a model.

132
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,338
"Erika Sakaki disappeared
after leaving a downtown club...

133
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,104
...shortly after 2 a.m."

134
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,975
Oh, my God.

135
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:26,575
- What?
- That's right when I shot her.

136
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:28,780
I gotta go.

137
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,548
- Where are you going?
- Cops. I'll call you later.

138
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:41,060
And they ran off after you made
your presence known.

139
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:44,030
No, you see them? No, no.

140
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:46,796
It wasn't until I pointed out
the surveillance camera.

141
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,803
That's what made them leave.

142
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:52,903
- Where did they go?
- I thought that they left...

143
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:55,580
...but it's quite possible,
and that's why I'm here...

144
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:58,409
...to say that perhaps they went
down another stairwell...

145
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:00,812
...and entered the same train
that she went on.

146
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,718
And you?

147
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:04,946
I told you. I...

148
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:07,489
I did not get on the train.
I left on foot.

149
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:11,095
- Okay.
- Okay?

150
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,132
Well, I'm sure anything
you need to know...

151
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,427
...will be on that surveillance tape.

152
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:19,433
Do you sell your photos?

153
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:24,769
What? Yes, but not like this.
Police calls mostly.

154
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,808
Erika's a pretty big model.

155
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,647
Tabloids be interested in these.

156
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:32,282
Really? I wouldn't know.

157
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:35,515
- Is that so?
- Yeah. I wasn't stalking her...

158
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,416
...if that's what you're indicating.

159
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:40,990
Look, l... I saw these guys.

160
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:43,821
I thought that they looked
suspicious, so I followed them.

161
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:46,122
But you did continue
to photograph her?

162
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,535
Well, yeah, yeah, but...
I guess so, but...

163
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:53,662
Why?

164
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,512
When you come up
with an answer, call me.

165
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:30,940
What?

166
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:34,779
It's nothing.
I didn't imagine you to be...

167
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,881
...the person that would say, "whoa."
- I'm not.

168
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,516
I don't.

169
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:43,454
I haven't said it since high school.

170
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,523
But that's how good it is.

171
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:56,830
I'm having a group show
in three weeks.

172
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,933
Get me two more images that strong...

173
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,942
...and you'll be a part of it.

174
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:14,317
Okay.

175
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,844
Oh, good.

176
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:21,024
Without your unconditional
love and support...

177
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,289
...and without you finally introducing
me to one of your contacts...

178
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,761
I can't believe you made me wait
so long.

179
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,325
- None of this
would have been possible.

180
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,229
I love you both.

181
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:38,769
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

182
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,044
- Now, I must depart.
- What? No.

183
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:49,720
- What? Where are you...? What?
- Two more images.

184
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:51,822
That's not tonight. No.

185
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:53,246
Why can't...?

186
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:56,621
- Two more shots. That's all I need.
- What about these shots?

187
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:17,772
Hey, tell your wife to relax.

188
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:22,517
Sweetie, I take the train every day.
Safer than walking.

189
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,712
But you hear these stories.

190
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:28,859
That was ages ago. Look, no graffiti,
air conditioning works.

191
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,621
You can understand the conductor.
It's a new century.

192
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,527
We're getting at off the next stop,
so you can do what you want...

193
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,897
...but we're getting off, okay.

194
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:42,869
All right, fine. You know what?
We can go back to my place...

195
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,009
...and Leigh here can cook us...

196
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:48,441
...a nice romantic dinner for three.
- Did we just miss our stop?

197
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,882
- You'd have to talk my wife into bed.
- You're into it.

198
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,642
- Randle.
- Wait a second, honey.

199
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:56,320
You know, it's cheap wine.

200
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:57,814
Cheaper than the plate.

201
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:00,082
- Maybe if you didn't sleep...
- Randle.

202
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:01,486
- What?
- What trips me out...

203
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:03,058
Randle!

204
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,501
Randle!

205
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,286
No!

206
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:41,726
Why are you doing this?

207
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,532
No!

208
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,684
I'm sorry, mister, l...

209
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:50,684
I just wanted a picture of you.

210
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,754
Sometimes I don't know
what I'm thinking.

211
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:24,243
- Hey, buddy?
- What?

212
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:25,945
Mind if I take a look?

213
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:28,555
- Officer, you can't do that.
- Yes, I can.

214
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,558
Orange Alert and above,
I can search whatever I want.

215
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:33,492
How do I know
you don't got explosives?

216
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:35,256
It's a camera.

217
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:19,006
Yeah. Life's like a box of chocolates.

218
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:39,328
What the hell is going on?

219
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:41,691
Supposed to be a local.

220
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,204
This is a citizen's arrest.

221
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:28,643
Damn.

222
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:44,293
Damn!

223
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:53,066
I'm gonna shove
that hammer up your ass!

224
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:06,907
I'm very disappointed in you, Mahogany.

225
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:09,314
Clean up the mess.

226
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:51,388
Jeez.

227
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:54,053
God.

228
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:58,930
- How'd you get in here?
- The spare key.

229
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:03,238
Okay, before you freak out...

230
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,439
...let me just say it's not
an engagement ring...

231
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:10,205
...until I make enough money, but it's...

232
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:13,441
It says that we're engaged
to be engaged.

233
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:15,243
It's not bad, hey?

234
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:17,148
No.

235
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,861
- I have horrible taste.
- No, you don't.

236
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:26,626
- It's beautiful.
- You think so?

237
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,501
It should fit.

238
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:48,477
I can't imagine my life without you.

239
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:52,352
Don't even try.

240
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,088
I love you.

241
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:40,704
Baby.

242
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:17,839
No!

243
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:17,021
Who's this guy?

244
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:21,022
Oh. I don't know. A butcher.

245
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,727
He was at the station the night
that model disappeared.

246
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:26,493
Are they for your show?

247
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:30,470
- No, there's just something about him.
- Yeah, I'd say.

248
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:33,405
But why are you following him?

249
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:36,341
It seems like you should be
working on your stuff for Susan.

250
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:39,516
No, no, I know,
but if that model's still missing...

251
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:43,209
...and he was at the station...
- Yeah, so just, you know...

252
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:47,389
...give a picture
to the cops and move on.

253
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:49,525
I mean, people disappear all the time.

254
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:51,786
Whatever happened, they'll figure it out.

255
00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:37,540
- What?
- What?

256
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:39,572
What's wrong?

257
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:42,011
How can I put this delicately?

258
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:44,215
You look like shit.

259
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:45,979
Give me a break.
I'm working my ass off.

260
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:48,181
Doing what? Contracting TB?

261
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:51,361
Hey, Otto, take a look
at the dying man over here.

262
00:43:51,562 --> 00:43:53,393
What the fuck happened to you?

263
00:43:54,264 --> 00:43:55,356
What are your specials?

264
00:43:56,834 --> 00:44:00,235
We have brisket on rye,
turkey meatloaf on rye...

265
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:03,331
...chicken parmigiana on r...

266
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:12,237
What? What's the big deal?
It's one bite.

267
00:44:15,953 --> 00:44:18,046
Fuck it. Give me one of these.

268
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:23,560
You sure about that? It's a steak. Meat.

269
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:25,251
Absolutely.

270
00:44:51,221 --> 00:44:52,711
Hey.

271
00:44:57,394 --> 00:44:59,521
I know I look like shit.

272
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,624
More of the butcher?

273
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:07,765
That's where he works.

274
00:45:11,008 --> 00:45:14,444
Babe, listen to me.
I don't care if you eat meat.

275
00:45:14,645 --> 00:45:19,776
I eat it all the time.
But this thing with this butcher...

276
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:21,780
Shouldn't you be focusing
on your work?

277
00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:24,351
Oh, God, remember what you told me?

278
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:28,389
About how people are always missing
for all sorts of reasons, right?

279
00:45:28,592 --> 00:45:29,581
- Right?
- Yeah.

280
00:45:29,793 --> 00:45:32,728
Usually, there's a reason.
I've been thinking about that lately.

281
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:36,331
Look at this. These pins represent
missing people for the last 3 years.

282
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:39,730
Not one of them has ever turned up.
No letter home. No call for money.

283
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:42,701
Not even a corpse. Nothing.
They just vanished into thin air.

284
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:47,536
- Okay, so what do you think happened?
- Well, it's not chance.

285
00:45:48,712 --> 00:45:50,543
Somebody's abducting them.

286
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:55,275
And they never find the bodies
because he takes them here.

287
00:45:55,486 --> 00:45:57,010
- He butchers them?
- Yeah.

288
00:45:57,221 --> 00:46:00,281
- Baby... Listen to me. I'm sure...
- Look at this. Look what I found.

289
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:02,015
This is...

290
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:07,387
So some guy
was accused of kidnap...

291
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,566
- A guy who worked...
- This is a century ago.

292
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,394
A guy who worked in the same plant.

293
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:14,264
What are you saying?
You saying that it's the same person?

294
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:17,304
Is that what you're saying?
I don't understand how that works.

295
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:19,703
How does that work? How...?
Was he reincarnated?

296
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:22,071
No, no. I don't know. Maybe, but look...

297
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:25,578
...the point is that it's happened before.
It can't be a coincidence.

298
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:29,583
No, this guy's involved somehow.
I know it. Look at this. Look at this.

299
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,721
I was there the night that it happened.

300
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:34,220
She got abducted.
This is the train she went in on.

301
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:37,450
That's his hand. You know how I know?
I took another photograph...

302
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:41,461
...of him going down into the subway,
the same subway. I totally got him.

303
00:46:41,665 --> 00:46:44,828
This is the guy, Maya. It's been
happening. There's been abductions.

304
00:46:45,035 --> 00:46:47,902
It's happened. I don't know
if it's a copycat, but I got him.

305
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:50,198
This is not what's going on, okay?

306
00:46:50,407 --> 00:46:53,308
This is all fake, okay? It's not.

307
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:56,206
No more. No more night shoots.

308
00:46:56,413 --> 00:46:58,779
No more, please. Just day shoots.

309
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,950
I don't want you to shoot terrible things.

310
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:03,244
I want you to stop
with the conspiracy theory.

311
00:47:03,453 --> 00:47:05,353
I want you to stop with the butcher.

312
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:08,354
I just want you to shoot
the stuff that makes you happy.

313
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:11,119
What makes you happy?
What do you love?

314
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:14,252
Please.

315
00:47:15,232 --> 00:47:16,927
Don't leave me.

316
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:20,403
You, I love you.

317
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:23,238
I love you.

318
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:06,413
I got it.

319
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:15,681
That's good.

320
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:32,906
I'm sorry.

321
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:35,175
Why?

322
00:48:35,812 --> 00:48:37,439
I'm sorry.

323
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,760
Jurgis showed me a picture
of that broad...

324
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:03,462
...that's gonna make your boy
rich and famous.

325
00:49:03,674 --> 00:49:05,733
Yeah? So?

326
00:49:08,578 --> 00:49:11,911
What do you have to do to get a date
with a broad like that, huh?

327
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:16,412
Magically transform into someone
who does not call women "broads."

328
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:24,989
Maya. Can I talk to you for a second?

329
00:49:25,195 --> 00:49:27,129
No fucking way.

330
00:49:27,331 --> 00:49:30,596
No. Come back later. She's busy.
Come back later.

331
00:49:33,437 --> 00:49:34,870
You okay?

332
00:49:35,605 --> 00:49:37,129
You were right.

333
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:42,536
That's all I wanted to say.

334
00:51:29,953 --> 00:51:32,353
Candy. You want to buy some candy?

335
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:33,955
Sorry, man.

336
00:51:38,328 --> 00:51:39,761
Whatever, man.

337
00:51:49,506 --> 00:51:51,406
You want to buy some candy, mister?

338
00:51:57,214 --> 00:52:00,012
- Go to somebody else.
- Come on, man, buy some candy.

339
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:38,215
Was that a game or what?

340
00:55:59,556 --> 00:56:01,251
Oh, shit.

341
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:22,970
Hey! Open up!

342
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:25,010
Open the fucking door!

343
00:56:25,415 --> 00:56:27,508
Open the fucking door!

344
00:58:42,485 --> 00:58:43,474
My God.

345
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:51,016
- Who is it?
- It's me.

346
00:58:52,629 --> 00:58:54,597
Oh, thank God, baby.

347
00:58:54,797 --> 00:58:56,389
Where have you been?

348
00:58:57,567 --> 00:58:59,762
Leon, what's the matter? Leon.

349
00:58:59,969 --> 00:59:03,063
Leon, what's going on?
Leon, what's the matter?

350
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:06,806
Leon?

351
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:10,744
Babe, come on, open up.
What's going on?

352
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:16,776
Leon, open the door.

353
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:20,856
Leon, you're scaring me.

354
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:25,954
Please open the door.

355
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:31,624
This is not fair, Leon.

356
00:59:34,337 --> 00:59:36,100
Open the door.

357
00:59:38,274 --> 00:59:40,299
Open this fucking door now!

358
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:43,604
You know you can't do this.
This is not fucking fair.

359
00:59:43,813 --> 00:59:46,748
You cannot just be out, gone all night,
and just disappear...

360
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:49,441
...and then fucking lock the door
in my face.

361
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:56,918
- I need to sleep.
- No, no, no, baby, baby, baby.

362
00:59:57,126 --> 01:00:00,960
Babe, babe, babe, what happened?
What happened?

363
01:00:01,998 --> 01:00:04,990
Oh, God. What is this?

364
01:00:05,201 --> 01:00:06,225
Honey.

365
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:09,934
We have to get you
to a hospital right now.

366
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:15,037
I followed him into the subway.

367
01:00:15,244 --> 01:00:16,541
Wha...?

368
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:19,878
It's always the late train.

369
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:24,315
Probably the same one each time.
He waits for it to empty out...

370
01:00:25,188 --> 01:00:26,951
...and then he kills them.

371
01:00:28,057 --> 01:00:30,525
He butchers them like cattle.

372
01:00:31,427 --> 01:00:32,985
I saw it.

373
01:00:34,197 --> 01:00:35,960
I took pictures.

374
01:00:38,835 --> 01:00:42,635
They never find the remains because
he unloads the meat somewhere.

375
01:00:45,508 --> 01:00:48,341
We have to...
I have to call an ambulance.

376
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:51,977
There's an abandoned
subway station...

377
01:00:52,181 --> 01:00:54,274
...underneath the meat plant.
- Okay.

378
01:00:54,684 --> 01:00:58,120
Here's what we're gonna do.
I'm gonna take you to the hospital...

379
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,380
...and when the doctors
are working on you...

380
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:03,081
...l'm gonna take your pictures,
take them to the cops.

381
01:01:03,793 --> 01:01:06,557
They won't listen. My camera's gone.

382
01:01:06,763 --> 01:01:08,731
- What?
- He took it from me.

383
01:01:09,432 --> 01:01:12,595
- That's the only proof I have.
- Baby, it's gonna be okay.

384
01:01:12,802 --> 01:01:16,568
I'm gonna call an ambulance, okay?
I'm gonna fix it.

385
01:01:27,116 --> 01:01:29,107
- It's okay.
- No.

386
01:01:29,419 --> 01:01:32,616
They'll think I'm a lunatic.
They'll think that I killed Erika.

387
01:01:32,822 --> 01:01:34,255
I know. I want to help you.

388
01:01:34,457 --> 01:01:36,891
Help me. I want to help you.

389
01:01:37,093 --> 01:01:38,526
No.

390
01:01:39,595 --> 01:01:41,062
Sleep.

391
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:46,091
My opening's tonight.

392
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:05,547
- We're as crazy as he is.
- No, we're not.

393
01:02:05,755 --> 01:02:08,246
Because we know what
we're doing is insane.

394
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:10,258
He doesn't.

395
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,929
What else are we gonna do?
Jurgis, what else?

396
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:17,099
We need his camera.
We need to see what he saw.

397
01:03:26,502 --> 01:03:27,935
Jesus Christ.

398
01:03:28,171 --> 01:03:29,570
No, no, no.

399
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:34,607
I want you to wait here.
If he comes back...

400
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:38,071
...just make a sound, okay? Hey.

401
01:04:30,233 --> 01:04:32,827
- Jurgis.
- What if he comes back?

402
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:34,730
If he comes back, we're screwed.

403
01:04:34,937 --> 01:04:37,531
It's gonna go a lot faster
with two of us, okay?

404
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:41,642
I'm gonna go this way. Fuck.

405
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:44,348
Jurgis?

406
01:08:09,118 --> 01:08:10,551
Jurgis.

407
01:09:13,716 --> 01:09:15,911
- Miss Jones.
- Did you find Jurgis?

408
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:20,452
Calm down. Please, sit.

409
01:09:23,225 --> 01:09:25,750
I just received the report
from an officer on the scene.

410
01:09:26,262 --> 01:09:29,390
They went to the room you gave me.
There's nobody there.

411
01:09:29,765 --> 01:09:32,495
But that can't be right.
They met the tenant in the lobby.

412
01:09:32,701 --> 01:09:35,363
He let them examine the place.
He's been out the whole day.

413
01:09:35,571 --> 01:09:36,970
No.

414
01:09:37,373 --> 01:09:38,772
He's a butcher.

415
01:09:38,974 --> 01:09:40,703
Leon says that he slaughters people...

416
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:43,435
...he kills them.
He's seen it, photographed it.

417
01:09:43,646 --> 01:09:45,705
- What are you talking about?
- It sounds crazy.

418
01:09:45,915 --> 01:09:48,782
I didn't believe it either.
But I was in his room.

419
01:09:48,984 --> 01:09:51,179
I saw the tools he uses.

420
01:09:51,387 --> 01:09:54,220
Okay, let's talk about
what really happened.

421
01:09:55,558 --> 01:09:59,892
The tenant said a family heirloom
is missing, an album.

422
01:10:00,329 --> 01:10:02,422
- He wants it back.
- It's a timetable.

423
01:10:02,631 --> 01:10:05,327
With a check for every murder
going back a hundred years.

424
01:10:05,534 --> 01:10:08,059
You cannot give that back.
It's the only proof we have...

425
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:10,067
Let me see it, please.

426
01:10:12,575 --> 01:10:15,043
The tenant doesn't want
to press any charges.

427
01:10:15,244 --> 01:10:16,677
He just wants his property back.

428
01:10:18,814 --> 01:10:20,748
I don't have it.

429
01:10:21,483 --> 01:10:23,041
Jurgis does.

430
01:10:24,587 --> 01:10:26,111
You have to find Jurgis.

431
01:10:26,322 --> 01:10:29,257
Look, you've already admitted
to breaking and entering.

432
01:10:29,458 --> 01:10:32,484
That's very serious.
I could hold you for that alone.

433
01:10:32,695 --> 01:10:36,153
If you do not go back with me,
I'm gonna go back with someone else.

434
01:10:36,365 --> 01:10:39,027
And you'll be arrested, Miss Jones.

435
01:10:53,182 --> 01:10:56,151
Phil and Sue Bennet.
They buy what I tell them to.

436
01:10:56,352 --> 01:10:58,650
But to give themselves
the illusion of free will...

437
01:10:58,854 --> 01:11:01,322
...they wait for my third suggestion.

438
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:05,250
The Kleins. They'll want some
alone time with you.

439
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:08,021
Just a little postmodern chitchat.

440
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:10,630
Humor them. It's a sale.

441
01:11:12,134 --> 01:11:14,898
The Franks.
Now, they never buy photography...

442
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:17,629
...but if anyone can convert them...

443
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:19,904
Jack, Andi...

444
01:11:20,376 --> 01:11:22,435
...l'd like you to meet Leon.

445
01:11:24,613 --> 01:11:27,844
Andi thinks you're more like
a painter than a photographer.

446
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:31,515
Andi, that's...
That's very perceptive of you.

447
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:34,154
I actually started out as a painter.

448
01:11:34,356 --> 01:11:37,257
Duty calls. If you'll excuse me.

449
01:11:42,531 --> 01:11:43,964
Excuse me.

450
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:45,530
Sure.

451
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:28,939
Come on, your public awaits you.

452
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:35,544
I'm not holding my breath on that one.
A tad too bleak.

453
01:12:36,618 --> 01:12:38,552
Leon?

454
01:12:38,754 --> 01:12:40,119
Where are you going?

455
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:43,690
I said, where are you going?

456
01:12:47,796 --> 01:12:49,855
I got a train to catch.

457
01:12:54,103 --> 01:12:56,663
- No, you said medium rare.
- Hey.

458
01:12:56,872 --> 01:12:58,430
Hey, zip it, huh?

459
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:00,870
It's hot. Hold on one second.

460
01:13:01,477 --> 01:13:04,412
Hey, where the hell you been?
Excuse me?

461
01:13:04,613 --> 01:13:06,274
- Where is it?
- Where's what? My...

462
01:13:06,515 --> 01:13:09,643
Maya. All right, now you're
as crazy as your boyfriend.

463
01:13:09,852 --> 01:13:11,649
What? Stop. What are you doing?

464
01:13:11,854 --> 01:13:13,287
All right, Maya.

465
01:13:13,822 --> 01:13:15,084
Stop right... Hey, hey!

466
01:13:15,290 --> 01:13:16,814
Don't you... If you... Don't leave!

467
01:13:17,025 --> 01:13:19,289
Maya! Maya!
Stay right there, honey...

468
01:13:19,495 --> 01:13:21,156
Leon, are you there?

469
01:13:21,363 --> 01:13:24,821
That butcher, baby, the butcher,
I think he has Jurgis.

470
01:13:25,033 --> 01:13:27,729
You... l... That cop, detective, l...

471
01:13:27,936 --> 01:13:29,528
Miss Jones.

472
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:35,805
I want the book, Miss Jones.

473
01:13:36,011 --> 01:13:40,004
Tell me what's fucking going on.

474
01:13:40,749 --> 01:13:41,977
Now.

475
01:13:43,552 --> 01:13:45,144
Do you have any idea?

476
01:13:46,555 --> 01:13:48,716
Where is Jurgis?

477
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:53,355
Tell me.

478
01:13:57,032 --> 01:13:58,829
He's on the train.

479
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:02,468
14th Street. First one after 2:00.

480
01:18:11,186 --> 01:18:12,949
No!

481
01:18:40,115 --> 01:18:41,446
No!

482
01:18:42,684 --> 01:18:44,015
No!

483
01:18:50,192 --> 01:18:51,250
Oh, my God.

484
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:05,297
Maya.

485
01:19:09,845 --> 01:19:11,779
Oh, my God, Jurgis.

486
01:19:11,980 --> 01:19:15,040
Maya. Maya.

487
01:19:17,285 --> 01:19:20,049
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

488
01:19:53,188 --> 01:19:54,519
Oh, God. Oh, God.

489
01:20:34,362 --> 01:20:35,693
No!

490
01:20:46,741 --> 01:20:48,572
No. No!

491
01:20:59,054 --> 01:21:00,487
Hey!

492
01:23:45,353 --> 01:23:47,685
No, Jurgis!

493
01:23:53,595 --> 01:23:54,755
No.

494
01:25:36,030 --> 01:25:37,395
Leon?

495
01:26:14,903 --> 01:26:18,236
Please, step away from the meat.

496
01:30:11,873 --> 01:30:14,034
Take this...

497
01:30:28,022 --> 01:30:29,785
Welcome.

498
01:31:02,089 --> 01:31:04,523
He didn't have
what it takes anymore.

499
01:31:07,128 --> 01:31:08,823
He knew it must be done.

500
01:31:09,030 --> 01:31:10,019
It was a privilege.

501
01:31:15,403 --> 01:31:16,563
I envy you.

502
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:01,371
Before you were born...

503
01:32:01,582 --> 01:32:05,609
...or the birth of any other human thing,
that's how long.

504
01:32:06,454 --> 01:32:09,252
Or longer. And now you found us...

505
01:32:10,892 --> 01:32:13,725
...as only a few before you have.

506
01:32:14,362 --> 01:32:16,887
The intimate circle
that keeps the secret...

507
01:32:17,365 --> 01:32:20,425
...we protect and nurture them...

508
01:32:20,635 --> 01:32:23,263
...and order is thereby preserved.

509
01:32:29,143 --> 01:32:32,635
It must be done
to keep the worlds separate.

510
01:32:35,116 --> 01:32:37,050
You'll understand soon enough.

511
01:33:23,965 --> 01:33:28,732
- Now, serve as we all do...
- No.

512
01:33:28,936 --> 01:33:30,233
...without question.

513
01:34:05,940 --> 01:34:07,601
<i>Police say Miss Jones</i>
<i>and Mr. Thompkins...</i>

514
01:34:07,808 --> 01:34:09,275
<i>... are only missing at this point...</i>

515
01:34:09,477 --> 01:34:12,776
<i>... although foul play has not</i>
<i>been ruled out. Elsewhere...</i>

516
01:34:12,980 --> 01:34:15,608
<i>... preparations are underway</i>
<i>for the arrival of leaders...</i>

517
01:34:15,816 --> 01:34:17,784
<i>... of several nations</i>
<i>in the European Union.</i>

518
01:34:17,985 --> 01:34:19,782
<i>The mayor's office</i>
<i>issued a statement...</i>

519
01:34:19,987 --> 01:34:22,080
<i>... supporting prospects</i>
<i>of new opportunities.</i>

520
01:34:22,289 --> 01:34:24,917
<i>Meetings are scheduled</i>
<i>with local business leaders.</i>

521
01:34:25,126 --> 01:34:29,028
<i>The meetings will include a tour of</i>
<i>the city's harbor and transport facilities.</i>

522
01:34:29,363 --> 01:34:33,697
<i>Stay tuned to WEQT for further</i>
<i>developments in this story.</i>
