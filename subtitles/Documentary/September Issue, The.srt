00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,780
J'aime beaucoup
de choses à la campagne.

3
00:01:37,068 --> 00:01:41,479
J'aime les fleurs, j'aime les arbres.

4
00:01:41,864 --> 00:01:43,398
Um...

5
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:45,507
Et quoi d'autre ?

6
00:01:47,138 --> 00:01:48,864
Quoi d'autre ?

7
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:52,700
Oui, les collines peut-être ?
Les animaux, les oiseaux.

8
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:54,042
Oui, oui.

9
00:01:54,138 --> 00:01:59,507
Et pensez-vous que la campagne est
plus tranquille que la ville ? Par exemple.

10
00:01:59,891 --> 00:02:03,343
Oui, mais pas assez excitante.

11
00:02:03,534 --> 00:02:06,604
- Uh, quand j'ai venu ici...
- Quand je suis venue.

12
00:02:06,987 --> 00:02:09,959
Oh, gosh. How many times
have I made that mistake ?

13
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:14,275
It's common among my pupils.
It's what they most often get wrong.

14
00:02:14,563 --> 00:02:16,194
Oh, what's the difference ?

15
00:02:16,481 --> 00:02:21,275
If and when I ever get to visit Paris again,
I'll have long forgotten all my French.

16
00:02:22,618 --> 00:02:25,111
- I must be going.
- No !

17
00:02:25,303 --> 00:02:27,413
Stay. It's still early.

18
00:02:27,701 --> 00:02:30,481
- I mean, what are you gonna do at home ?
- Nothing special.

19
00:02:30,865 --> 00:02:34,796
Right. I mean, how many times
can you putter around the garden ?

20
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:40,166
God !

21
00:02:40,454 --> 00:02:42,852
I can't believe my mother.

22
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:44,961
She's out there...

23
00:02:45,153 --> 00:02:48,892
She's made friends with Peter and
is trying to get him to write her biography.

24
00:02:49,276 --> 00:02:52,633
Her stupid life. "As told to."

25
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:56,084
Oh, come on, now.
She'll be gone in a couple of days.

26
00:02:56,372 --> 00:03:00,496
Yeah, that's what you said last week.
Time passes and she's still here.

27
00:03:01,455 --> 00:03:06,441
Oh, look at this. She will not stop picking
the flowers, which I asked her not to do.

28
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,414
She doesn't even put them in water,
so of course they die.

29
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,867
Walking around in a snit
is not gonna make the time go any faster.

30
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:18,716
When I ask Peter if he wants to go for a
drive or walk, he's busy writing his novel.

31
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,976
But he's got plenty of time
to stroll around the lake with her.

32
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,620
- You must admit she tells funny stories.
- See ? Men.

33
00:03:25,908 --> 00:03:28,018
She certainly hasn't lost her knack.

34
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:32,333
- Somehow I thought Peter'd be different.
- Lane, it's your mother.

35
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,976
- Is that when you dated Errol Flynn ?
- Oh, I was too old for Errol Flynn.

36
00:03:36,264 --> 00:03:38,181
I mean, I met him when I was 16.

37
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:41,443
For Errol, 15 was over the hill.

38
00:03:42,497 --> 00:03:46,621
Lane, I invited the Richmonds for drinks
tonight. I thought we might have a party.

39
00:03:46,908 --> 00:03:52,278
What did you do that for ? Peter and I were
supposed to see the new Kurosawa film.

40
00:03:52,662 --> 00:03:55,635
- Sorry. Why didn't you say something ?
- I did.

41
00:03:55,922 --> 00:03:58,033
That's OK. We can catch it another night.

42
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,525
OK, but it's only there tonight.

43
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,019
- Where was I ?
- How we met.

44
00:04:03,211 --> 00:04:07,046
Oh ! Lt was like a bad movie.
We both hailed the same taxicab.

45
00:04:07,334 --> 00:04:11,553
- We shared a cab and fell in love.
- And I know nothing about physics.

46
00:04:11,841 --> 00:04:15,293
- So what did you talk about ?
- Talk ? By the time the meter hit $3...

47
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:15,715
- .. she had her tongue in my ear.
- Oh ! Lloyd !

48
00:04:15,715 --> 00:04:20,809
How nice. I drop in to visit my daughter
and she has a writer renting her cottage.

49
00:04:30,732 --> 00:04:32,074
I'm trying to write.

50
00:04:32,266 --> 00:04:34,951
I think my life story
would make a sure-fire bestseller.

51
00:04:35,431 --> 00:04:38,307
I know. I remember reading
about your exploits in the paper.

52
00:04:38,499 --> 00:04:42,335
You're too young, but anything,
whatever your dad read, it's all true.

53
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:46,650
No, I remember your picture in the long
defunct New York Journal-American...

54
00:04:47,034 --> 00:04:49,910
.. with an actor named
Jeff Chandler, who you dated.

55
00:04:52,404 --> 00:04:53,747
What a memory.

56
00:04:54,034 --> 00:04:56,047
What a memory ! That was Palm Beach !

57
00:04:56,239 --> 00:04:57,774
I love Palm Beach !

58
00:04:57,966 --> 00:05:02,377
That's where Lloyd and I were heading
when I decided to stop off to see Lane.

59
00:05:03,718 --> 00:05:07,937
Um... I hadn't seen her, you know,
since she... took the pills.

60
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:14,267
God, that had to be six, eight months ago.

61
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:18,678
Boy, what some people will do for love.

62
00:05:19,062 --> 00:05:20,980
Or the lack of it.

63
00:05:21,171 --> 00:05:24,624
Of course, I understand.
I mean, if you've never had something...

64
00:05:24,816 --> 00:05:28,268
.. and then you experience it
and then it's taken away...

65
00:05:29,515 --> 00:05:31,337
Wow. Poor kid.

66
00:05:35,076 --> 00:05:39,008
Try and stroke the ball to the rhythm of
the music. It'll give you a smooth motion.

67
00:05:39,295 --> 00:05:42,844
- Yeah, but the music's so fast.
- Keep it rhythmic, and keep your eye...

68
00:05:43,132 --> 00:05:46,200
Steffie, Mrs Mason thinks
she's got me an offer on the house.

69
00:05:46,392 --> 00:05:48,501
That's great. Congratulations.

70
00:05:48,692 --> 00:05:51,762
Two. Not great. But,
after everything's paid off,...

71
00:05:52,145 --> 00:05:56,172
.. there'd be something to put a down
payment on an apartment in New York.

72
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:58,858
I can get two for mine,
and it's half your acreage.

73
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:01,638
Well, I can't really afford to be choosy.

74
00:06:01,926 --> 00:06:05,858
At least I have a customer.
I think. I hope, at least.

75
00:06:06,145 --> 00:06:08,639
Don't give it away.
I can lend you what you need.

76
00:06:08,831 --> 00:06:11,516
No, Howard. Oh, God, no.
Thank you, though.

77
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:15,352
No. You've been... You've been
incredible to me through all this,...

78
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:19,954
- .. but I've gotta try and get my own life...
- What can you do in New York ?

79
00:06:20,242 --> 00:06:22,256
I don't know. I...

80
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:25,036
Maybe my photography again. I was...

81
00:06:25,228 --> 00:06:29,543
Or sometimes I think
about writing, but I don't know.

82
00:06:29,927 --> 00:06:33,091
It's awful, isn't it, at my age
to be floundering around so ?

83
00:06:33,283 --> 00:06:36,256
I just... I don't know what I want.

84
00:06:37,407 --> 00:06:40,379
A child. I'd love to have a child.

85
00:06:40,571 --> 00:06:44,024
Lane, did you, by any chance,
finish those chapters I gave you ?

86
00:06:44,311 --> 00:06:48,914
- Yeah, almost. They're wonderful.
- I thought about them. I'm discouraged.

87
00:06:49,298 --> 00:06:53,133
- You shouldn't be. You're wrong.
- I just wanna start over, again.

88
00:06:53,421 --> 00:06:56,105
You can't tear up
everything you write, you know.

89
00:06:56,394 --> 00:06:59,655
Otherwise of course you have
to take tranquillisers to calm down.

90
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:03,203
It seems so futile.
I was supposed to be finished by now.

91
00:07:03,395 --> 00:07:06,271
Next week is Labor Day.
I have to be back at my job the day after.

92
00:07:06,655 --> 00:07:08,573
If you wouldn't let
my mother seduce you...

93
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:10,970
Now, her life would make
a fascinating book.

94
00:07:11,257 --> 00:07:14,805
Why ? What's so fascinating
about her frivolous existence ?

95
00:07:14,997 --> 00:07:17,491
That she left my father,
who was a wonderful man,...

96
00:07:17,682 --> 00:07:20,750
.. for a gangster who beat her up ?
You think that's compelling ?

97
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:24,202
Was it the shooting ? That wasn't
fascinating. That was pathetic.

98
00:07:24,394 --> 00:07:28,039
Maybe it's that she's a survivor, and
the book I'm writing is about surviving.

99
00:07:28,326 --> 00:07:32,066
You're right. She went on with her life,
but I get stuck with the nightmares.

100
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,272
Excuse me. Uh...

101
00:07:34,847 --> 00:07:37,724
Diane wanted some ice cubes
and you seem to be out.

102
00:07:38,107 --> 00:07:42,999
Um, there's a... there's an ice machine
just outside the back door.

103
00:07:44,917 --> 00:07:49,998
And you're wrong to think your mother
didn't suffer terribly over that whole affair.

104
00:07:56,615 --> 00:07:58,628
Right. Poor thing

105
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:02,273
She experienced a little hearing loss
in her left ear from the gunshot.

106
00:08:02,465 --> 00:08:04,286
Noise trauma.

107
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:08,025
The only point I wanted to make -
and I didn't mean to upset you -

108
00:08:08,313 --> 00:08:12,917
.. is that some people are survivors and
some let life's tragedies annihilate them.

109
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:18,766
- This is just one of the cruelties of living.
- And in your book that idea is moving.

110
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:24,904
But the story of a 14-year-old girl
who kills her mother's lover is... sleazy.

111
00:08:25,287 --> 00:08:28,069
And the trial was sleazy
and he was sleazy.

112
00:08:28,261 --> 00:08:32,384
And my mother was
completely unconcerned.

113
00:08:32,671 --> 00:08:34,494
I'm sorry.

114
00:08:34,685 --> 00:08:37,754
I'm sorry. I'll get you those pages.

115
00:08:38,137 --> 00:08:42,069
And they're good, you know, despite what
you think. I won't let you tear them up.

116
00:08:42,069 --> 00:08:42,715
- Very good. I'm very impressed.
- You liked that ?

117
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:07,096
Oh !

118
00:09:07,288 --> 00:09:09,590
I didn't know
you were a pool player.

119
00:09:11,219 --> 00:09:13,139
Now you know.

120
00:09:16,015 --> 00:09:18,605
Did you ever get a chance
to play that record I got you ?

121
00:09:18,796 --> 00:09:20,330
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

122
00:09:20,714 --> 00:09:22,920
I play it all the time.

123
00:09:23,111 --> 00:09:26,659
It's so beautiful.
I was just listening to it last night.

124
00:09:27,714 --> 00:09:29,535
Somehow I knew you'd like it.

125
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:34,905
Did I hear you say
your book was about survival ?

126
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:40,467
Yeah, well, it's not really about survival.
It's about, you know. It's about everything.

127
00:09:40,851 --> 00:09:43,824
Oh, really ?
Like the Encyclopaedia Britannica.

128
00:09:46,126 --> 00:09:48,810
Excuse me.
I'd better get those papers and work.

129
00:09:50,537 --> 00:09:53,317
Howard, it's so unlike you to be rude.

130
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:57,154
We don't need another book on survival.
We already have the Boy Scout manual.

131
00:09:57,537 --> 00:09:59,360
Lane says he's talented.

132
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:03,387
Well, if he's such a hotshot, why's he
wasting his life on Madison Avenue ?

133
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,989
It's because writing beer and
deodorant ads is more within his grasp.

134
00:10:08,277 --> 00:10:10,866
I'm surprised at you.
You're the kindest man,...

135
00:10:11,058 --> 00:10:14,126
.. and you can't bring yourself to say
one good word about Peter.

136
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:16,619
He's OK. I don't mean he's a bad person.

137
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:21,414
But I can't stand that Lane
gets so moonstruck over his line.

138
00:10:21,702 --> 00:10:25,345
- I mean, she blushes when he's around.
- Now you sound jealous.

139
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,702
What's the difference ?
She's going away anyhow.

140
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,812
I knew that was bothering you.

141
00:10:32,442 --> 00:10:36,757
If you could have seen her at the
beginning of the year when she came up.

142
00:10:37,044 --> 00:10:41,264
She was in such bad shape. She needed
someone to take care of her so badly.

143
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:45,100
She's very fragile.

144
00:10:45,292 --> 00:10:48,361
We used to spend
long afternoons together,...

145
00:10:48,553 --> 00:10:51,141
.. winter evenings listening to music.

146
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:56,991
It was such a pleasure watching her gain
strength and begin to enjoy things more.

147
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,223
I remember one night I was home alone
after we'd seen a movie together...

148
00:11:03,607 --> 00:11:07,442
.. and I noticed that I missed her and
I couldn't wait to see her the next day.

149
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:12,909
And that's when I realised
I never wanted her to leave here.

150
00:11:13,293 --> 00:11:15,115
- Oh, Howard.
- Thank you.

151
00:11:17,608 --> 00:11:22,018
I never said anything. I knew she was
through a terrible time and not over it.

152
00:11:24,704 --> 00:11:28,444
I didn't think she was ready to hear
that someone had become...

153
00:11:28,636 --> 00:11:30,553
.. dependent on her.

154
00:11:31,321 --> 00:11:33,239
I didn't want to...

155
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:38,897
I didn't want to say anything that would
frighten her or cause her any confusion.

156
00:11:41,102 --> 00:11:43,690
Well, after all,
I am much older than she is.

157
00:11:44,841 --> 00:11:50,115
So in the end I hedged and
procrastinated and... obsessed over her.

158
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:54,047
And over the right moment to speak.

159
00:11:54,238 --> 00:11:56,924
Next thing I knew
she was in love with that tenant,...

160
00:11:57,212 --> 00:12:01,048
.. that sensitive young man who
suddenly started occupying all her time.

161
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,869
Well,...

162
00:12:03,157 --> 00:12:07,280
.. one can see how
having Peter on the premises, just...

163
00:12:08,719 --> 00:12:11,692
- - .. just the two of them for seven weeks,...

164
00:12:11,884 --> 00:12:14,186
.. how she could fall very much in love.

165
00:12:15,144 --> 00:12:18,021
Never thought I could
feel this way after Karen died.

166
00:12:18,309 --> 00:12:20,322
Hello ?

167
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:24,445
Steffie ! Lt's your husband.
He says it's important.

168
00:12:28,186 --> 00:12:30,061
Lane's changed towards me.

169
00:13:02,228 --> 00:13:04,338
She used to get such a kick out of me.

170
00:13:05,488 --> 00:13:09,995
She used to laugh at my jokes
and tell me how pretty I looked.

171
00:13:12,872 --> 00:13:14,693
She's become so angry.

172
00:13:16,707 --> 00:13:19,680
What do you think, honey ?
This or the pink one, with the jacket ?

173
00:13:20,063 --> 00:13:22,077
- This one.
- You're the boss.

174
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:24,474
Hey. Hey !

175
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,968
Come here. Where you goin', huh ?

176
00:13:30,804 --> 00:13:34,736
Boy, oh boy ! Am I lucky I hailed that taxi !

177
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:38,187
You're the only man I've known
worth marrying since Lane's father.

178
00:13:38,571 --> 00:13:41,256
The others were just nothin' !

179
00:13:41,448 --> 00:13:45,859
Just nothin'. And the proof is, when
they asked me to marry 'em, I said no.

180
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:49,312
- I'm the lucky one.
- You, lucky ?

181
00:13:51,133 --> 00:13:53,531
You inherited a machine
that's grinding to a halt.

182
00:13:53,819 --> 00:13:56,311
Between my ulcers and
my gall bladder and my angina...

183
00:13:56,599 --> 00:14:00,435
The whole is greater than
the sum of the parts. Remember ? Hm ?

184
00:14:00,626 --> 00:14:02,449
Said the bishop to the showgirl.

185
00:14:02,449 --> 00:14:05,325
- Sorry.
- No, come in.

186
00:14:07,243 --> 00:14:09,640
- You wanted to borrow this pin ?
- Oh, yeah.

187
00:14:09,832 --> 00:14:13,093
But I've decided on a whole other outfit
so I don't think I'll need it.

188
00:14:13,476 --> 00:14:15,970
- It's lovely. Where'd you get it ?
- You gave it to me.

189
00:14:16,258 --> 00:14:17,887
I did ? What taste !

190
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,669
- Doesn't Diane look stunning ?
- She looks great.

191
00:14:20,955 --> 00:14:24,025
Try to have a good time tonight.
You don't wanna turn into a recluse.

192
00:14:24,408 --> 00:14:27,669
I just really didn't feel up to
having people over tonight.

193
00:14:29,683 --> 00:14:32,464
You have to learn
to put the past behind you.

194
00:14:32,656 --> 00:14:34,573
What's done is done.

195
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,299
It's easy to say.

196
00:14:36,491 --> 00:14:38,984
I know you wanted to go
to the movies with Peter.

197
00:14:39,175 --> 00:14:43,108
Is he a good writer ? I mean, seriously,
could he write my biography ?

198
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:47,231
- Oh, Mom, don't be foolish.
- Foolish ? I've been offered good money.

199
00:14:47,423 --> 00:14:51,162
Peter's trying to write a serious book.
You shouldn't be distracting him.

200
00:14:51,546 --> 00:14:54,039
God, he's always asking me
millions of questions.

201
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:57,395
I don't think your memoirs
are something you wanna make public.

202
00:14:57,683 --> 00:14:59,505
Really ? I'm not ashamed of my life.

203
00:14:59,697 --> 00:15:01,710
Your mother was offered
quite an advance.

204
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:06,025
Then she should find somebody else
to write it. And leave me and Dad out of it.

205
00:15:06,217 --> 00:15:09,670
I can't leave you out of it.
That's the part everybody's interested in.

206
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:12,260
You're exploiting an ugly situation.

207
00:15:12,451 --> 00:15:14,944
You've become so touchy lately.

208
00:15:15,232 --> 00:15:18,972
I mean, if your life hasn't worked out,
stop blaming me for it.

209
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,753
Take the bull by the horns.
Make something happen.

210
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,821
I'm sorry. Not everybody's
a human dynamo like you.

211
00:15:25,013 --> 00:15:27,698
Your mother does have
remarkable energy.

212
00:15:27,986 --> 00:15:32,301
You were such a promising young girl,
so bright, and you had my looks.

213
00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:36,712
Well, you had better bone structure
than I did, but you lacked my height.

214
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,300
And you had your father's intelligence.

215
00:15:39,588 --> 00:15:43,712
You gotta do something about all that.
I mean, you're young, you're lovely.

216
00:15:43,904 --> 00:15:46,110
Of course, you dress like a Polish refugee.

217
00:15:46,684 --> 00:15:49,274
I don't feel too attractive these days.

218
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:53,205
Peter thinks you're beautiful.
And he's right.

219
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:56,850
- Does he ?
- He sings your praises.

220
00:15:57,042 --> 00:15:58,864
He's probably just being polite.

221
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,700
You really like him, don't you ?

222
00:16:04,042 --> 00:16:07,206
- I don't know.
- You've gotta be a little cool about it.

223
00:16:07,494 --> 00:16:11,809
- You shouldn't let your desperation show.
- I don't think I have.

224
00:16:12,001 --> 00:16:16,508
I always felt there was a fatal element
of hunger in your last affair.

225
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,521
That's not true.

226
00:16:18,617 --> 00:16:22,069
I don't think Jeff would have run
quite so quickly back to his wife...

227
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,946
.. if he didn't feel a certain pressure.

228
00:16:25,138 --> 00:16:26,481
I sensed it.

229
00:16:26,768 --> 00:16:30,796
His name was Jack. And you were never
here, so you don't know what happened.

230
00:16:31,467 --> 00:16:34,248
Darling, don't be so defensive.

231
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:37,700
I base this observation
on the time I saw you together.

232
00:16:37,988 --> 00:16:43,071
And I'm not saying anything different than
those high-priced psychiatrists have said.

233
00:16:43,455 --> 00:16:47,386
When it comes to men, you're probably
doing something to stand in your way.

234
00:16:47,769 --> 00:16:49,687
- I probably am.
- Yeah.

235
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:53,139
Well, this is out.
Looks like I'm going to a luau !

236
00:16:54,961 --> 00:16:57,071
Oh, my God. Look at me.

237
00:16:59,276 --> 00:17:01,290
I gotta redo my whole make-up.

238
00:17:06,372 --> 00:17:08,193
It's hell, gettin' older.

239
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,126
Especially when you feel 21 inside.

240
00:17:17,016 --> 00:17:20,181
All the strengths that sustain you
all through your life...

241
00:17:20,469 --> 00:17:23,633
.. just vanish one by one.

242
00:17:26,606 --> 00:17:29,388
And you study your face
in the mirror and you...

243
00:17:35,524 --> 00:17:37,826
You notice something is missing.

244
00:17:40,702 --> 00:17:43,004
And then you realise it's your future.

245
00:17:49,044 --> 00:17:50,963
So that's...

246
00:17:51,826 --> 00:17:54,798
That's why I want you to find yourself...

247
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,867
.. while there's still time left to enjoy it.

248
00:17:57,867 --> 00:18:00,744
- Hi.
- Hi.

249
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:28,936
- I guess I'm early.
- The guests haven't arrived yet.

250
00:18:32,197 --> 00:18:35,361
Well, you look wonderful, all dressed up.

251
00:18:36,608 --> 00:18:38,429
It's starting to rain.

252
00:18:39,676 --> 00:18:41,499
Maybe it'll cool things off.

253
00:18:42,649 --> 00:18:44,472
Let's hope.

254
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:55,020
Well, you look lovely.
I said that !

255
00:18:55,211 --> 00:18:57,130
Thank you.

256
00:18:58,856 --> 00:19:01,061
- Did you know the, um...
- Steffie...

257
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:05,952
- Sorry. What were you gonna say ?
- No. What ?

258
00:19:06,335 --> 00:19:09,116
- You looked like you were...
- No, nothing.

259
00:19:09,116 --> 00:19:11,993
Thunder's getting close.

260
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:16,116
Yeah.

261
00:19:18,705 --> 00:19:21,390
So, who's the history professor ?

262
00:19:21,678 --> 00:19:25,705
The history professor ? How did you know
about that ? Did we talk about that ?

263
00:19:25,994 --> 00:19:30,405
Well, you mentioned to me one time that
that might be the title of your book.

264
00:19:31,747 --> 00:19:34,048
The history professor was my father.

265
00:19:36,445 --> 00:19:39,706
He taught at a college
in Connecticut and he...

266
00:19:41,145 --> 00:19:43,159
.. he was fired during the McCarthy era.

267
00:19:43,351 --> 00:19:46,707
He was blacklisted. He had to do
all kinds of things to keep us going.

268
00:19:46,898 --> 00:19:48,433
Like what ?

269
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:52,748
He supported us by playing poker
and betting the horses.

270
00:19:53,036 --> 00:19:54,953
He sounds wonderful.

271
00:19:55,241 --> 00:19:57,063
Yeah, he was.

272
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,090
I see what you mean by a survivor.

273
00:20:06,268 --> 00:20:08,377
This summer went by too fast.

274
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,324
I had such high hopes for this book.

275
00:20:15,379 --> 00:20:17,392
To tell you the truth, I'm floundering.

276
00:20:17,392 --> 00:20:20,269
Is this the first time
you've tried to write a book ?

277
00:20:25,064 --> 00:20:29,572
Oh, I've published a couple of short
stories. Nothing... Nothing any good.

278
00:20:31,201 --> 00:20:35,516
I've never been able to do it full time. I've
always been busy with other obligations.

279
00:20:38,202 --> 00:20:40,311
You don't want to hear about all this.

280
00:20:40,598 --> 00:20:43,858
You know, Lane showed me
some of your short stories and...

281
00:20:44,146 --> 00:20:46,064
.. I thought they were wonderful.

282
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:49,420
It's funny.

283
00:20:50,379 --> 00:20:52,584
I've wanted to talk to you so often,...

284
00:20:53,831 --> 00:20:55,845
.. but we never seem to be alone.

285
00:20:57,092 --> 00:20:59,969
We were alone.
We were alone for a whole afternoon.

286
00:21:01,024 --> 00:21:04,860
Running into you at the local
flea market is not exactly private.

287
00:21:05,626 --> 00:21:08,791
Well, we walked around together.
You didn't say anything.

288
00:21:08,983 --> 00:21:10,804
No, I didn't, did I ?

289
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,162
Well, I felt awkward.

290
00:21:17,326 --> 00:21:22,025
At least you liked the record I found you
so it wasn't a complete waste of time.

291
00:21:22,312 --> 00:21:26,436
It's so funny because I used to be in love
with a boy who just idolised Art Tatum.

292
00:21:26,723 --> 00:21:30,079
Well, this was years ago
on my first visit to Paris.

293
00:21:30,367 --> 00:21:34,970
He was a student and he played piano
in a jazz club in the student quarter.

294
00:21:35,449 --> 00:21:37,270
He didn't speak any English.

295
00:21:38,134 --> 00:21:41,970
And we spent a summer trying to make
each other understand our feelings.

296
00:21:42,162 --> 00:21:45,806
The funny thing was it didn't matter
that we only knew a few words.

297
00:21:46,189 --> 00:21:49,066
Oh, anyway, that was years ago.

298
00:21:49,066 --> 00:21:51,943
I hate thunder. I don't care how harmless
it is, I wanna get under the bed !

299
00:21:55,971 --> 00:21:58,752
- The air is full of electricity.
- I'm serious !

300
00:21:59,136 --> 00:22:01,245
- Where is everyone ? I heard voices.
- Hi.

301
00:22:01,533 --> 00:22:03,835
- How do I look ? Don't say "old and fat".
- Great.

302
00:22:04,121 --> 00:22:06,423
Great. What time
do the guests arrive ?

303
00:22:06,711 --> 00:22:10,834
Any minute. Let's get some more lights
on. Did Lane make any hors d'oeuvres ?

304
00:22:12,369 --> 00:22:14,478
What were you two doing
before we came down ?

305
00:22:14,765 --> 00:22:16,396
Excuse me ? What ?

306
00:22:16,684 --> 00:22:19,944
I hope you weren't out on the porch.
That lightning's getting close.

307
00:22:20,327 --> 00:22:21,574
- Oh, no.
- No.

308
00:22:21,766 --> 00:22:24,546
- Let's have some music.
- All right. Who wants what ?

309
00:22:24,834 --> 00:22:28,670
- Well, you know about me. Peter ?
- Vodka.

310
00:22:28,862 --> 00:22:31,643
- Stephanie, what do you want ?
- Vodka, please.

311
00:22:32,026 --> 00:22:34,616
Have you given any more thought
about my memoirs ?

312
00:22:34,808 --> 00:22:39,219
They deserve better than me. They're
too good to waste on a fledgling writer.

313
00:22:39,602 --> 00:22:41,808
You're patronising me.

314
00:22:42,096 --> 00:22:45,644
- Lane says you think my life is trivial.
- I never said that.

315
00:22:45,644 --> 00:22:48,521
- Lloyd, come on, dance with me.
- Oh, honey, I'm such a stiff.

316
00:22:51,973 --> 00:22:55,041
If you can figure out the universe,
you can figure out the box step.

317
00:22:55,424 --> 00:22:57,247
All right.

318
00:23:00,699 --> 00:23:02,904
See, there ? You're terrific.

319
00:23:03,191 --> 00:23:05,014
- I try.

320
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:21,028
I had so many things
I wanted to say to you.

321
00:23:21,219 --> 00:23:26,015
Oh, well, it's, you know... There are
people coming over and people here, so...

322
00:23:26,303 --> 00:23:28,796
- I don't wanna be pushy.
- No, you're not pushy.

323
00:23:29,084 --> 00:23:31,385
I wish you'd been here
for the whole summer.

324
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:35,700
Yeah, well, I couldn't.
I have obligations, too, so...

325
00:23:36,084 --> 00:23:38,194
What is that record ? Lt's terrific !

326
00:23:38,385 --> 00:23:40,303
It's Art Tatum and Ben Webster.

327
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:43,563
- It's funny.
- What ?

328
00:23:43,658 --> 00:23:46,152
I made a complete fool
out of myself when I met you.

329
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,508
- No ! You didn't.
- I remember carrying on at great length...

330
00:23:49,796 --> 00:23:52,480
.. about writing and metaphor and choice.

331
00:23:52,672 --> 00:23:57,468
- I left no cliché unturned.
- No. Actually I just... No, I...

332
00:23:57,755 --> 00:23:59,769
I just thought you were so sweet.

333
00:24:01,687 --> 00:24:06,098
You reminded me of Paul,
the boy that I knew in Paris.

334
00:24:06,961 --> 00:24:08,879
- Really ?
- Yeah.

335
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:12,140
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm very flattered.

336
00:24:12,332 --> 00:24:15,688
Which one is Art Tatum
and which is Ben Webster ?

337
00:24:15,879 --> 00:24:17,798
Art Tatum's the piano.

338
00:24:19,427 --> 00:24:22,400
See, and I always felt foolish
all the time because...

339
00:24:22,592 --> 00:24:24,893
- Why ?
- .. I was very taken with you right off.

340
00:24:25,181 --> 00:24:29,304
I love all the music from that era. You
don't have any Benny Goodman, do you ?

341
00:24:29,592 --> 00:24:31,318
Uh, not here.

342
00:24:31,606 --> 00:24:33,811
Or Coon-Sanders Nighthawks ?

343
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:39,181
- Now, please don't panic when I say this.
- No.

344
00:24:39,372 --> 00:24:42,058
I just think that you're incredibly lovely.

345
00:24:43,593 --> 00:24:48,003
Peter, don't. Don't, please.
Let's just stop this before it's too late.

346
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:50,401
You know, I can't.

347
00:24:50,592 --> 00:24:55,003
I just... I just feel flushed
and... and my heart is pounding.

348
00:24:56,155 --> 00:24:58,936
- - Oh, there are the Richmonds.

349
00:24:59,224 --> 00:25:01,045
Get it, will you, Lloyd ?

350
00:25:03,827 --> 00:25:06,415
- Oh, Howard !
- Oh, it's pouring out there.

351
00:25:06,607 --> 00:25:09,579
We were expecting the Richmonds.
Let me get you a drink.

352
00:25:09,771 --> 00:25:13,511
Hi, Howard. Hi. Oh, the Richmonds
must be stuck. You're wet.

353
00:25:13,894 --> 00:25:15,333
Yes, I know.

354
00:25:16,004 --> 00:25:19,264
Look, my old Ouija board ! Look !

355
00:25:19,456 --> 00:25:22,620
They take too long. What you want
is a computerised Ouija board.

356
00:25:23,004 --> 00:25:25,978
That way you can punch up
any dead person you wanna talk to.

357
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:29,334
- Howard, you did say Scotch ?
- Ask Lane to dance with you.

358
00:25:29,622 --> 00:25:31,539
- Me ?
- Mm-hm. She'll be thrilled.

359
00:25:31,827 --> 00:25:33,937
- She's got a big crush on you.
- I don't dance.

360
00:25:34,128 --> 00:25:37,868
That's what everybody says.
Come on. She's been so blue.

361
00:25:38,156 --> 00:25:39,977
- Lane ?
- Yes ?

362
00:25:40,265 --> 00:25:42,184
Go ahead. Go ahead !

363
00:25:42,472 --> 00:25:45,636
Uh, Lane, uh, Peter was just asking me...

364
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:48,417
.. if I'd ask you to dance with him.

365
00:25:49,183 --> 00:25:51,197
Oh ! No, thank you.

366
00:25:51,485 --> 00:25:55,321
Oh, yes, thank you.
That music is fabulous !

367
00:25:55,608 --> 00:25:58,389
I used to go to Harlem
to hear music like that.

368
00:25:58,581 --> 00:26:01,842
I was dating a disc jockey.
He used to call records "sides".

369
00:26:02,033 --> 00:26:03,855
- - I have two left feet.

370
00:26:04,142 --> 00:26:07,306
I'll get that. I'll get it.
You just enjoy yourselves.

371
00:26:07,306 --> 00:26:10,184
- Is she bothering you ?
- No, not at all.

372
00:26:12,773 --> 00:26:15,937
- I like her energy.
- It's the record you got at the flea market.

373
00:26:16,129 --> 00:26:18,911
- I didn't know you liked jazz.
- You like Prokofiev.

374
00:26:19,198 --> 00:26:20,924
Yeah, but not to dance to.

375
00:26:21,691 --> 00:26:24,089
The Richmonds aren't coming.
Their house is flooded.

376
00:26:24,377 --> 00:26:26,774
Really ? Then maybe
we can go to the Kurosawa film.

377
00:26:27,062 --> 00:26:29,938
- In this storm ?
- Well, you know, maybe.

378
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,048
Let's not let it kill our evening.

379
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,596
The Richmonds aren't coming.
We're lucky. They're so boring !

380
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:39,527
- Then why did you invite them ?
- Uh-oh. Oh, God !

381
00:26:39,815 --> 00:26:42,309
- This could last for hours.
- Lloyd.

382
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:46,144
- Just light some candles.
- OK. I'll get some matches.

383
00:26:46,336 --> 00:26:49,021
I love walking around
in the pitch-black.

384
00:26:49,308 --> 00:26:51,226
I think I put my hand in the guacamole.

385
00:26:51,418 --> 00:26:55,446
Lloyd ! The Richmonds are
flooded, the electricity's gone off.

386
00:26:55,734 --> 00:26:59,857
God is testing us and l, for one,
am gonna be ready. Where's the vodka ?

387
00:26:59,857 --> 00:27:02,734
T.

388
00:27:47,996 --> 00:27:49,914
O.

389
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:56,435
M.

390
00:27:57,202 --> 00:27:59,024
I don't know any Toms.

391
00:28:00,174 --> 00:28:02,092
Oh, wait a minute.

392
00:28:02,668 --> 00:28:07,079
Are you that dentist in Hackensack
that tried to rape me when I was 15 ?

393
00:28:08,326 --> 00:28:10,147
No ? OK.

394
00:28:11,586 --> 00:28:13,407
OK.

395
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:15,421
One more try.

396
00:28:15,421 --> 00:28:18,297
N.

397
00:28:23,763 --> 00:28:25,585
Ooh, I.

398
00:28:28,846 --> 00:28:29,710
C.

399
00:28:29,997 --> 00:28:32,202
Oh, God. Nick.

400
00:28:33,641 --> 00:28:35,942
Wait a minute. Are you in this room ?

401
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:39,969
Is your ghost in this room,
bullet hole an' all ?

402
00:28:42,272 --> 00:28:44,190
You were so bad.

403
00:28:45,052 --> 00:28:46,875
But so gorgeous.

404
00:28:48,984 --> 00:28:52,245
Do you still comb your hair
like you were in Sicily ?

405
00:28:55,121 --> 00:28:57,039
Well, we had some good times.

406
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,162
It was hectic.

407
00:29:02,313 --> 00:29:04,134
It was dangerous.

408
00:29:06,532 --> 00:29:08,354
And then it ended.

409
00:29:18,999 --> 00:29:21,012
I think it's clearing up.

410
00:29:22,354 --> 00:29:24,081
Yeah ?

411
00:29:37,986 --> 00:29:39,999
Please don't move away from here.

412
00:29:44,314 --> 00:29:46,232
I have to.

413
00:29:49,396 --> 00:29:53,136
You know, I should never drink.
My head really spins.

414
00:29:53,903 --> 00:29:55,726
How are you gonna drive home ?

415
00:29:56,972 --> 00:29:58,794
Same way I always do:

416
00:29:59,945 --> 00:30:01,767
.. thinking about you.

417
00:30:05,028 --> 00:30:09,630
You know, in all the time I've known you
I don't think I've ever seen you drink.

418
00:30:10,013 --> 00:30:11,453
No.

419
00:30:12,604 --> 00:30:15,864
Although the year after my wife died
I was never sober.

420
00:30:18,453 --> 00:30:23,918
Of course, on the faculty of the school
where I work, it's... hard to tell.

421
00:30:29,192 --> 00:30:31,110
I'm gonna miss you so much.

422
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:35,233
I'm gonna miss you, too,...

423
00:30:35,425 --> 00:30:37,726
.. but we'll always stay in touch.

424
00:30:37,918 --> 00:30:40,028
You know what I'm saying.

425
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,138
Howard, please.

426
00:30:42,905 --> 00:30:44,824
I have to...

427
00:30:46,357 --> 00:30:49,906
When you got that offer today
to sell the house, I...

428
00:30:50,288 --> 00:30:52,111
.. I realised suddenly...

429
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:56,139
.. we wouldn't be sharing
those winter evenings again.

430
00:30:56,331 --> 00:31:01,221
Yeah, but you knew I was only up here
to get well, and not permanently.

431
00:31:03,044 --> 00:31:06,879
Is the difference in our ages
awkward for you ?

432
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:13,399
I'm in love with Peter.

433
00:31:14,742 --> 00:31:16,948
Isn't that the most ridiculous thing ?

434
00:31:18,481 --> 00:31:21,742
Considering I don't think
I even have a chance with him.

435
00:31:23,372 --> 00:31:25,290
I did for a while.

436
00:31:26,633 --> 00:31:32,003
I keep telling myself that maybe
it'll still work out all right somehow.

437
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:36,126
And why Peter and not you ?

438
00:31:38,044 --> 00:31:39,961
No reason worthy of you.

439
00:31:43,607 --> 00:31:45,716
How often I've wanted to touch you.

440
00:31:49,551 --> 00:31:51,853
Please. Please, don't.

441
00:31:53,674 --> 00:31:55,784
Now that I've embarrassed us both...

442
00:31:57,127 --> 00:32:01,730
Let me make you some coffee. You're
gonna have a terrible hangover tomorrow.

443
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:04,606
I don't play this game that well
in the light, let alone the dark.

444
00:32:24,073 --> 00:32:25,895
Look how much it's cleared up.

445
00:32:28,293 --> 00:32:30,210
You can see a billion stars.

446
00:32:31,361 --> 00:32:33,183
It should be nice tomorrow.

447
00:32:35,772 --> 00:32:37,978
So tell me,...

448
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:40,854
.. is it true you worked on
the atomic bomb ?

449
00:32:41,046 --> 00:32:42,772
No.

450
00:32:43,059 --> 00:32:45,169
Did Diane tell you that ?

451
00:32:45,361 --> 00:32:46,992
Yes.

452
00:32:47,183 --> 00:32:48,909
Not at all.

453
00:32:49,101 --> 00:32:53,224
I did one small, unrelated project
at Los Alamos many years ago.

454
00:32:55,238 --> 00:32:58,691
But when she's describing me to people
I'm the father of the A-bomb.

455
00:32:58,882 --> 00:33:01,567
What branch of physics
are you involved with ?

456
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:06,553
Something much more terrifying
than blowing up the planet.

457
00:33:06,937 --> 00:33:08,567
Really ?

458
00:33:08,855 --> 00:33:12,883
Is there anything more terrifying
than the destruction of the world ?

459
00:33:13,171 --> 00:33:15,184
Yeah.

460
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,924
The knowledge that it doesn't
matter one way or the other.

461
00:33:19,212 --> 00:33:21,130
That it's all random.

462
00:33:22,472 --> 00:33:25,157
Originating aimlessly out of nothing and...

463
00:33:26,979 --> 00:33:28,992
.. eventually vanishing for ever.

464
00:33:31,007 --> 00:33:33,307
I'm not talking about the world.

465
00:33:33,499 --> 00:33:35,417
I'm talking about the universe.

466
00:33:36,568 --> 00:33:38,965
All space, all time, just...

467
00:33:40,597 --> 00:33:42,418
.. a temporary convulsion.

468
00:33:44,624 --> 00:33:46,445
And I get paid to prove it.

469
00:33:47,212 --> 00:33:50,472
You feel sure of that, when
you look out on a night like tonight...

470
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:54,691
.. and see all those millions of stars ?
That none of it matters ?

471
00:33:56,994 --> 00:33:59,679
I think it's just as beautiful as you do.

472
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:06,296
And vaguely evocative of some deep truth
that always just keeps slipping away.

473
00:34:08,692 --> 00:34:11,953
But then my professional
perspective overcomes me,...

474
00:34:13,295 --> 00:34:17,994
.. a less wishful,
more penetrating view of it,...

475
00:34:20,296 --> 00:34:22,692
.. and I understand it for what it truly is.

476
00:34:24,706 --> 00:34:26,529
Haphazard,...

477
00:34:27,584 --> 00:34:29,406
.. morally neutral...

478
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,762
.. and unimaginably violent.

479
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:37,940
Look, we shouldn't have
this conversation.

480
00:34:40,721 --> 00:34:42,544
I have to sleep alone tonight.

481
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:48,010
That's why I cling to Diane...

482
00:34:48,297 --> 00:34:50,311
.. and consider myself very lucky.

483
00:34:51,557 --> 00:34:55,393
She's warm and vital
and holds me while I sleep.

484
00:34:56,927 --> 00:35:01,626
That way I don't have to dream of
photons and quarks.

485
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:44,586
I have a question for you, Richard.

486
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,421
Your daughter hates me.

487
00:35:50,531 --> 00:35:52,449
Our daughter...

488
00:35:53,408 --> 00:35:55,423
.. hates me, and I love her.

489
00:35:57,148 --> 00:35:59,930
She's my one child,...

490
00:36:00,217 --> 00:36:02,422
.. and I want her to be happy.

491
00:36:06,162 --> 00:36:08,560
She never got over
the shooting, you know.

492
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,697
See, now, I'm a tough cookie.

493
00:36:16,135 --> 00:36:18,054
I can file and forget.

494
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,382
Rap once if you hear me, Richard.

495
00:36:29,176 --> 00:36:30,999
I want her to forgive me.

496
00:36:33,204 --> 00:36:36,177
So you speak to her. OK, Richard ?

497
00:36:38,861 --> 00:36:40,780
You two were so close.

498
00:36:42,314 --> 00:36:44,232
She loved you so much.

499
00:36:47,876 --> 00:36:49,794
You rap if you hear me, Richard.

500
00:36:53,534 --> 00:36:55,356
Rap, Richard.

501
00:36:57,466 --> 00:36:59,383
Rap once.

502
00:37:00,438 --> 00:37:02,260
Rap.

503
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:05,137
I love those old songs.

504
00:37:20,192 --> 00:37:23,739
Between the music,
the candlelight and the drinks,...

505
00:37:24,027 --> 00:37:26,713
.. it feels like we're in some exotic place.

506
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,055
Mm.

507
00:37:28,343 --> 00:37:30,549
I should never drink. My head swims.

508
00:37:36,877 --> 00:37:38,699
What are you doing ?

509
00:37:39,753 --> 00:37:43,399
I've wanted to touch your face
since the first time we met.

510
00:37:43,687 --> 00:37:45,604
What do you want me to say to you ?

511
00:37:55,097 --> 00:37:58,357
Soon we'll be going
in separate directions.

512
00:37:58,549 --> 00:38:01,234
Peter, you must know
that this is impossible.

513
00:38:01,522 --> 00:38:05,933
Lane is my best friend. She's crazy about
you. I don't think I could ever do that.

514
00:38:06,221 --> 00:38:09,289
- And she's become so attached to you.
- Please.

515
00:38:10,537 --> 00:38:13,413
I already feel guilty enough
because I led her on.

516
00:38:16,098 --> 00:38:19,838
Not on purpose. I just wasn't
thinking about anyone but myself.

517
00:38:21,851 --> 00:38:24,632
She's told me about
all the time you spent together.

518
00:38:24,919 --> 00:38:29,139
I know about all your walks and talks
by the lake, under the stars.

519
00:38:29,427 --> 00:38:31,345
She's told me all that.

520
00:38:32,976 --> 00:38:34,797
I felt very lonely.

521
00:38:36,044 --> 00:38:38,824
I needed some company,
and my marriage broke up.

522
00:38:41,126 --> 00:38:44,194
I was losing confidence
that I could write this book.

523
00:38:45,153 --> 00:38:47,646
I needed a voice
to keep me from panicking.

524
00:38:49,468 --> 00:38:51,387
But you made love together.

525
00:38:52,824 --> 00:38:56,757
I didn't understand how vulnerable
she was until it was too late.

526
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,647
I know it's my fault.

527
00:39:07,017 --> 00:39:11,717
Would you... Would you have become
serious about her if I hadn't come along ?

528
00:39:13,443 --> 00:39:15,648
I don't know. Maybe.

529
00:39:16,703 --> 00:39:19,867
You do funny things
when you feel empty inside.

530
00:39:20,059 --> 00:39:21,785
Look,...

531
00:39:23,415 --> 00:39:25,333
.. I'm married.

532
00:39:27,155 --> 00:39:30,799
You know, my kids come home
from camp in a week. I have a life.

533
00:39:31,087 --> 00:39:33,004
I know.

534
00:39:33,963 --> 00:39:35,785
But is it the life you want ?

535
00:39:38,566 --> 00:39:40,389
Is it ?

536
00:39:42,402 --> 00:39:46,142
- You've been flirting with me for weeks.
- Please, just go away.

537
00:40:01,485 --> 00:40:03,308
My husband's a wonderful man.

538
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:11,362
Oh, he's bewildered
because I wanted this summer apart.

539
00:40:15,197 --> 00:40:17,306
He's a radiologist.

540
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:20,471
He takes X-rays, but...

541
00:40:20,663 --> 00:40:24,595
.. I never let him take them of me
because, if he looked inside, he'd...

542
00:40:24,882 --> 00:40:29,198
.. he'd see things that he wouldn't
understand and he'd be terribly hurt.

543
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:32,842
Somewhere along the line I just...

544
00:40:34,856 --> 00:40:38,020
.. I just started going through
the motions of my life.

545
00:40:43,295 --> 00:40:45,116
Steffie...

546
00:40:47,802 --> 00:40:53,075
I've just... I've just longed so
to hear certain things said to me again.

547
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:59,212
I want so much to respond,
but I can only run.

548
00:41:01,035 --> 00:41:03,623
- Don't run.
- I can only run.

549
00:41:04,774 --> 00:41:06,691
That's all I can do.

550
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:13,021
I knew you cared about me.

551
00:41:13,213 --> 00:41:18,008
That's why I couldn't look at you when
you were around because I felt so guilty.

552
00:41:21,747 --> 00:41:23,666
I wanna kiss you right now.

553
00:41:25,488 --> 00:41:28,653
You can't. You can't because
there's too many problems.

554
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,762
This is just out of the question.

555
00:41:33,064 --> 00:41:36,132
Out of the question.
We're gonna be discovered.

556
00:41:36,324 --> 00:41:39,104
Just please go away.
It's out of the question.

557
00:42:10,558 --> 00:42:12,380
Time for me to go home.

558
00:42:13,243 --> 00:42:15,352
Sorry about the Kurosawa film.

559
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:20,722
I made some coffee before.
D'you want me to heat it up for you ?

560
00:42:21,106 --> 00:42:23,119
No, thanks. I'd rather stay drunk.

561
00:42:26,284 --> 00:42:29,736
Maybe you'd better.
I'm supposed to work tomorrow.

562
00:42:29,928 --> 00:42:32,516
You've been in such
a strange mood all night.

563
00:42:34,339 --> 00:42:37,790
Did you know that the universe
was haphazard, morally neutral...

564
00:42:38,078 --> 00:42:40,092
.. and unimaginably violent ?

565
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:47,572
Peter...

566
00:42:48,627 --> 00:42:50,449
What happened to us ?

567
00:42:51,887 --> 00:42:53,805
What do you mean ?

568
00:42:54,093 --> 00:42:57,546
You know, we were getting so close...

569
00:42:57,738 --> 00:43:01,285
.. and we... we shared all that time...

570
00:43:02,628 --> 00:43:04,833
.. and, um...

571
00:43:05,025 --> 00:43:07,519
.. and that night at the lake...

572
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:11,834
I mean, did I... Am I misreading the signs ?

573
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:15,669
Maybe you did.

574
00:43:18,545 --> 00:43:21,039
I can't let myself get involved right now.

575
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:28,039
I'm gun-shy from my marriage and...

576
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:31,491
.. I'm unsettled about my life, my work.

577
00:43:31,779 --> 00:43:33,601
Can I help ?

578
00:43:33,793 --> 00:43:37,916
They're my problems.
I don't wanna cause you any suffering.

579
00:43:39,354 --> 00:43:41,273
You're doing so well.

580
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,410
You need to think about yourfuture.

581
00:43:48,369 --> 00:43:50,574
Yeah, I know.

582
00:43:50,862 --> 00:43:52,685
I know you're right. I...

583
00:43:53,834 --> 00:43:56,232
It's silly, but I just...

584
00:43:56,424 --> 00:44:02,848
You know, I have these dreams
that, when we're both in New York,...

585
00:44:04,191 --> 00:44:06,492
.. you know, we'd...

586
00:44:06,779 --> 00:44:08,602
I don't know.

587
00:44:09,657 --> 00:44:14,164
You know, we just... We feel things
so similarly so much of the time,...

588
00:44:14,548 --> 00:44:16,369
.. and that's so rare.

589
00:44:18,863 --> 00:44:23,274
I don't... I'm sorry, I'm really tired.
I don't know what I'm saying.

590
00:44:25,192 --> 00:44:29,987
The funny thing is that I'll probably
wind up calling you at 3am in New York...

591
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:32,672
.. to keep me from going off the deep end.

592
00:44:32,672 --> 00:44:35,549
- Hi. Can I give you a hand there ?
- No, that's OK.

593
00:45:09,782 --> 00:45:11,893
Listen, I had a talk with Peter.

594
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:16,399
And he doesn't wanna
get involved right now.

595
00:45:16,687 --> 00:45:18,988
And that's OK. I understand that.

596
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:22,823
He's... You know,
he's got a lot of problems.

597
00:45:23,015 --> 00:45:27,043
But I... But maybe things
will be different later on. You know ?

598
00:45:27,426 --> 00:45:30,591
I'm glad that things are
out in the open anyway.

599
00:45:30,879 --> 00:45:32,700
You know, I do feel better.

600
00:45:33,659 --> 00:45:35,769
We'll both be living in New York.

601
00:45:36,057 --> 00:45:38,358
Who knows ? You know,
anything could happen.

602
00:45:38,358 --> 00:45:41,235
Who could that be ?

603
00:45:43,825 --> 00:45:44,880
Hello ?

604
00:45:45,072 --> 00:45:47,852
Oh, Ken. No, she's right here.
One second.

605
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:13,167
Ken, listen. I told you the lights were out
and the phone was out. I couldn't call you !

606
00:46:13,551 --> 00:46:15,373
Right. Yes.

607
00:46:16,428 --> 00:46:20,839
I still don't know. I'm thinking about
spending some time in New York.

608
00:46:21,127 --> 00:46:24,099
Please don't bring that up now.
It's late and I'm tired.

609
00:46:24,291 --> 00:46:26,305
Let me call you tomorrow. Good night.

610
00:46:26,305 --> 00:46:29,182
Oh, God.

611
00:46:46,827 --> 00:46:48,744
I didn't know you were still here.

612
00:46:50,567 --> 00:46:52,389
I heard your voice.

613
00:47:08,498 --> 00:47:10,321
Peter, we're not alone.

614
00:47:16,074 --> 00:47:17,896
Steffie, I love you.

615
00:47:21,636 --> 00:47:23,458
From the first day.

616
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:44,842
We could be alone.

617
00:47:48,102 --> 00:47:50,596
I can't spend the night in the guesthouse.

618
00:47:53,951 --> 00:47:55,870
Maybe not the whole night,...

619
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,186
.. but we could have
some of it alone together.

620
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:12,844
Oh, God.

621
00:48:15,432 --> 00:48:17,255
Would you ?

622
00:48:29,336 --> 00:48:31,255
Look, if...

623
00:48:32,788 --> 00:48:34,802
If this means anything to you,...

624
00:48:37,103 --> 00:48:39,693
.. I really want to, but I...

625
00:49:57,750 --> 00:50:00,339
I just love this room. It's just perfect.

626
00:50:00,531 --> 00:50:03,695
We could knock this wall out
and make one big room.

627
00:50:03,887 --> 00:50:07,914
- That's a thought.
- It's big enough as it is. I love the size.

628
00:50:08,202 --> 00:50:09,833
OK, whatever.

629
00:50:10,025 --> 00:50:12,614
- What about fishing ?
- The lake has bass, Lane told me.

630
00:50:12,902 --> 00:50:14,916
Of course, you can always stock the lake.

631
00:50:15,108 --> 00:50:18,655
It seems so inane to dump fish into a lake
just to pull 'em back out again.

632
00:50:19,039 --> 00:50:21,819
- No dumber than golf !
- Your wife's not a golfer !

633
00:50:22,011 --> 00:50:23,929
Gimme a break.

634
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:28,150
That's Diane Frazier. I used to have such
a crush on her when I'd see her picture.

635
00:50:28,437 --> 00:50:31,218
- Diane Frazier ? Wasn't she...
- She was a model, playgirl.

636
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:34,669
She was always at the Stork Club
or El Morocco with some tennis player.

637
00:50:34,957 --> 00:50:37,738
- Those people lead such exciting lives.
- Yes, don't they ?

638
00:50:38,121 --> 00:50:42,436
- It's gonna be great to get out of the city.
- I'm so excited about buying a dog.

639
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:46,464
Our co-op doesn't permit dogs
and I've always wanted a pit bull.

640
00:50:46,847 --> 00:50:49,629
I'd love to go upstairs
and take some measurements.

641
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:51,738
Lane, is it OK to go upstairs ?

642
00:50:51,929 --> 00:50:55,191
Oh, well, my mother's
still sleeping up there.

643
00:50:55,479 --> 00:50:58,643
- Really ?
- Yeah. She's a late sleeper.

644
00:50:59,027 --> 00:51:00,944
I don't think I ever slept past noon.

645
00:51:01,232 --> 00:51:03,534
- She'll be up soon.
- Maybe we could see the barn ?

646
00:51:03,725 --> 00:51:06,793
Could you show us the barn ?
I know Mr Raines has some questions.

647
00:51:06,985 --> 00:51:11,109
OK. You know where it is, don't you ?
Just follow that path out of the house.

648
00:51:11,397 --> 00:51:13,986
I'll join you in one second.
I just wanna finish up.

649
00:51:14,178 --> 00:51:15,904
- They gonna buy ?
- Looks like it.

650
00:51:16,096 --> 00:51:17,439
That's great.

651
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:21,562
Lane, Howard called, and the stand
that sells the corn you like is open again.

652
00:51:21,754 --> 00:51:24,054
- He's gonna bring some over.
- Uh-huh.

653
00:51:25,877 --> 00:51:28,465
What's the matter ?
Why are you so depressed ?

654
00:51:31,151 --> 00:51:33,739
I just think about Peter all the time.

655
00:51:36,712 --> 00:51:39,397
Lane, just don't. Don't.

656
00:51:39,589 --> 00:51:42,466
I think he's gonna
write that book on my mother.

657
00:51:42,754 --> 00:51:43,809
God.

658
00:51:44,001 --> 00:51:47,644
They're all supposed to go out today
together. If she ever gets up.

659
00:51:47,932 --> 00:51:50,617
Oh, she's up.
She said she'd be a little late.

660
00:51:50,808 --> 00:51:53,206
- Lane, could I speak to you ?
- Yes.

661
00:51:53,398 --> 00:51:55,604
- We need you to answer some questions.
- OK.

662
00:51:55,796 --> 00:51:57,906
Their final offer is 175.

663
00:51:58,098 --> 00:52:00,111
175 ? You said two !

664
00:52:00,398 --> 00:52:03,467
That's as high as they'd go.
This area isn't what it was.

665
00:52:03,754 --> 00:52:05,960
But I've really been counting
on that money.

666
00:52:06,152 --> 00:52:08,549
- Are you sure ?
- I'm sorry.

667
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:34,632
- - Yeah ?

668
00:52:37,797 --> 00:52:39,618
- Hi.
- Hi.

669
00:52:39,811 --> 00:52:44,509
Um, Diane said they'd be a little late.
I'll let them know that you're here.

670
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:56,017
You've really been avoiding me.

671
00:52:56,208 --> 00:52:58,509
I think you should leave
and go back to New York.

672
00:52:58,797 --> 00:53:00,811
I'd like to know what's going on.

673
00:53:01,003 --> 00:53:05,414
I'm having a hard time and, even
though she tries to hide it, Lane is, too.

674
00:53:05,797 --> 00:53:08,578
- Don't say that.
- She thinks about you all the time.

675
00:53:08,866 --> 00:53:12,031
- And you ?
- Naturally, I think about you.

676
00:53:13,469 --> 00:53:15,291
And yet you avoid me.

677
00:53:16,058 --> 00:53:20,469
- Will you write Diane's biography ?
- Believe it or not, I'm thinking about it.

678
00:53:20,757 --> 00:53:23,154
Why ? What happened
to the book about your father ?

679
00:53:23,442 --> 00:53:25,264
I know. I...

680
00:53:26,128 --> 00:53:28,908
It just isn't coming. I told you that.

681
00:53:29,196 --> 00:53:32,744
I've been beating my brains out
about it all summer long and I...

682
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:34,949
I don't know. It's lifeless.

683
00:53:35,717 --> 00:53:39,264
And then I hear all these sensational
anecdotes and stories. You know ?

684
00:53:39,552 --> 00:53:43,483
This woman's had an incredible life.
I mean, the shooting alone is a book.

685
00:53:43,771 --> 00:53:46,361
- Lane doesn't want it written.
- I'm not so sure.

686
00:53:46,551 --> 00:53:49,429
If I do it, I can protect her.
Somebody's gonna write it.

687
00:53:49,716 --> 00:53:53,360
Look, Peter, just put yourself
in her place for one minute.

688
00:53:53,648 --> 00:53:57,964
Here's this 14-year-old girl. Her mother
leaves her father, who Lane adored,...

689
00:53:58,347 --> 00:54:03,622
.. and moves in with this thug, who beats
up Diane, and Lane ends up shooting him.

690
00:54:04,005 --> 00:54:07,745
It's completely wrecked her life.
You don't wanna put her through it again.

691
00:54:07,936 --> 00:54:10,910
You know, people staring at her
as she walks down the street.

692
00:54:11,197 --> 00:54:12,828
I don't know.

693
00:54:16,184 --> 00:54:19,731
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I don't...

694
00:54:20,115 --> 00:54:23,759
I just feel so... guilt-ridden.

695
00:54:23,951 --> 00:54:25,869
I'm just very tense.

696
00:54:29,321 --> 00:54:31,431
Oh, Peter, please don't do this.

697
00:54:32,581 --> 00:54:34,307
Oh...

698
00:54:35,266 --> 00:54:36,991
Steffie.

699
00:54:40,253 --> 00:54:42,075
Let's...

700
00:54:43,609 --> 00:54:45,526
Let's go to Paris together.

701
00:54:48,308 --> 00:54:50,129
"Let's go to Paris together."

702
00:54:51,568 --> 00:54:56,076
My God. You really are
a writer, aren't you ?

703
00:54:58,377 --> 00:55:04,034
This is why I have to stay away from you.
Because you just make my head... spin.

704
00:55:04,418 --> 00:55:07,007
I just can't... I can't do this.

705
00:55:07,295 --> 00:55:09,116
I can't...

706
00:55:31,843 --> 00:55:33,666
Oh, my God.

707
00:55:35,775 --> 00:55:39,322
- I guess we should have knocked.
- I always worry about rabies.

708
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:44,597
I read about a woman bitten by a squirrel
in Central Park and she got rabies.

709
00:55:44,981 --> 00:55:47,475
Nothing like that
ever happens up here.

710
00:55:47,762 --> 00:55:51,694
What bothers me are not the
raccoons but gnats. They drive you crazy.

711
00:55:51,981 --> 00:55:55,241
You don't have a big
insect problem here, do you, Lane ?

712
00:55:55,529 --> 00:55:57,063
Lane ?

713
00:55:57,255 --> 00:56:00,036
- But you do have mosquitoes ?
- Naturally, with the pond.

714
00:56:00,228 --> 00:56:03,871
Well, mosquitoes are rare.
Aren't they, Lane ?

715
00:56:04,159 --> 00:56:06,844
- Lane ?
- It's... It's usually very pleasant.

716
00:56:07,803 --> 00:56:12,406
- I imagine the frogs'd eat the mosquitoes.
- If the snakes don't eat the frogs !

717
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:15,091
Is it OK if we go upstairs ?

718
00:56:15,283 --> 00:56:16,913
Yes, um...

719
00:56:17,105 --> 00:56:20,173
Sorry. I'm getting a headache.
I'll rejoin you in a few minutes.

720
00:56:20,365 --> 00:56:23,338
OK, but hurry. There are many questions
Mr and Mrs Raines have.

721
00:56:23,626 --> 00:56:26,024
Yes. Now, what about hornets and bees ?

722
00:56:26,311 --> 00:56:30,051
This is the country,
Mrs Raines, not midtown Manhattan.

723
00:56:30,339 --> 00:56:32,927
Oh, my God. I just can't
believe that happened !

724
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:36,764
- It was my fault.
- Oh, Peter, please ! I just can't handle this !

725
00:56:42,133 --> 00:56:44,339
Lane. Lane, I'm sorry.

726
00:56:45,490 --> 00:56:48,654
Lane. Lane, I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

727
00:56:49,613 --> 00:56:52,489
- Lane !
- Has this been going on long ?

728
00:56:52,777 --> 00:56:56,134
No. No ! Please. Jesus.

729
00:56:56,421 --> 00:56:59,107
- Are you in love with him ?
- It's not what you think.

730
00:56:59,490 --> 00:57:02,654
- What do you mean ?
- Lane, I just don't know what I've done.

731
00:57:02,846 --> 00:57:06,106
- I just don't know what I've...
- A lot of things make sense now.

732
00:57:06,394 --> 00:57:09,751
There's nothing to make sense.
Absolutely nothing to make sense.

733
00:57:09,943 --> 00:57:12,820
So many times I saw
you and Peter looking at each other.

734
00:57:13,204 --> 00:57:15,217
No, don't do that. Just don't do that.

735
00:57:15,313 --> 00:57:17,519
This is my fault. Stephanie's not to blame.

736
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:20,299
- Leave us alone.
- I'm sorry you found out like this.

737
00:57:20,683 --> 00:57:23,079
There's nothing to find out.
You're making it worse.

738
00:57:23,367 --> 00:57:26,532
There's not nothing.
Let's get this out on the table.

739
00:57:26,724 --> 00:57:28,929
I want Steffie to go with me
to New York or Paris.

740
00:57:29,217 --> 00:57:33,628
Peter, the summer's over. I'm going back
to Philadelphia. I miss my children.

741
00:57:33,915 --> 00:57:37,367
I can't play these games.
I've been married too long. I just...

742
00:57:37,751 --> 00:57:40,820
I don't know what I am.
I don't know what I've done.

743
00:57:41,012 --> 00:57:44,081
I just... I'm not who I thought I was.

744
00:57:44,369 --> 00:57:47,437
I'm beginning to think
that antique fair will be too crowded.

745
00:57:47,629 --> 00:57:50,217
You're getting cold feet
about driving to East Hope.

746
00:57:50,409 --> 00:57:52,903
I am not. I just thought
today's the wrong day.

747
00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:56,739
We could postpone it. You and Peter
could work on the book around here.

748
00:57:57,027 --> 00:58:00,479
You know, Peter, I think we could do
a whole section on Las Vegas.

749
00:58:00,766 --> 00:58:04,122
I know so many great
Sammy Davis stories. He's the best.

750
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:08,053
- Did ya tell Lane about our conversation ?
- Oh, yeah. Listen, darling.

751
00:58:08,437 --> 00:58:11,985
Lloyd and I have decided
that we wanna live here.

752
00:58:12,273 --> 00:58:14,958
This house is our idea of heaven.

753
00:58:15,246 --> 00:58:19,465
I fell in love with it the moment
I stepped inside. It was like coming home.

754
00:58:19,753 --> 00:58:24,836
I know you're off back to the city,
but whenever you wanna use it, it's yours.

755
00:58:25,219 --> 00:58:28,192
You know, weekends
or the summertime. Whenever.

756
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:31,548
You're gonna need a sweater.
I better go up and get one.

757
00:58:31,739 --> 00:58:33,178
I don't understand.

758
00:58:33,466 --> 00:58:36,726
You know one of my first
projects ? I'm gonna put in a pool.

759
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:41,329
I never, ever liked the pond
because there's live things in there !

760
00:58:41,617 --> 00:58:43,344
Your mother's a wonderful swimmer.

761
00:58:43,534 --> 00:58:46,220
I took her swimming in Santa Fe.
She outdid everybody.

762
00:58:46,508 --> 00:58:50,247
- She's got perfect legs for a bathing suit.
- What are you talking about ?

763
00:58:50,535 --> 00:58:52,740
We're gonna move back here.

764
00:58:52,932 --> 00:58:55,425
We've discussed it
and decided to move back here.

765
00:58:55,617 --> 00:58:59,740
Lloyd loves Vermont
and I have always loved this house.

766
00:59:00,124 --> 00:59:02,521
- And if...
- You can't move back here.

767
00:59:04,151 --> 00:59:08,370
- Why not ?
- Because I'm about to sell this place.

768
00:59:08,658 --> 00:59:10,384
- You're selling it ?
- I told you...

769
00:59:10,576 --> 00:59:14,891
- Wait a minute. Since when ?
- I've mentioned this three times at least.

770
00:59:15,179 --> 00:59:18,536
- You have ?
- Don't you ever listen to me when I talk ?

771
00:59:18,728 --> 00:59:21,316
Do you only care about
what you have to say ?

772
00:59:21,604 --> 00:59:23,330
Why are you getting so nasty ?

773
00:59:23,522 --> 00:59:26,879
I got people here right now - buyers.
They're looking at it.

774
00:59:27,167 --> 00:59:31,673
Well, Jesus, wherever they are, just go
and find them and tell them the sale is off.

775
00:59:31,961 --> 00:59:35,605
- What ?
- You can't sell it. It's gonna be our home.

776
00:59:35,988 --> 00:59:37,810
You can't tell me that now.

777
00:59:37,906 --> 00:59:40,783
What are you talking about ?
This is the family house.

778
00:59:41,071 --> 00:59:43,563
How can you sell this place ?
You don't own it.

779
00:59:43,755 --> 00:59:46,727
- Well, who owns it ?
- Uh... I do.

780
00:59:46,919 --> 00:59:50,851
Well, I mean, we do. You and me.
Your father and I bought it.

781
00:59:51,138 --> 00:59:55,742
But you gave it to me years ago. I told you
then I might sell it and divide the money.

782
00:59:56,030 --> 00:59:59,865
- You said great, you could use the cash.
- Was I sober when I gave it to you ?

783
01:00:00,249 --> 01:00:03,606
- You said it was mine.
- To live in, darling, but not to sell.

784
01:00:03,797 --> 01:00:08,208
To live in ? What does that mean ?
To maintain ? To repair ? To keep up ?

785
01:00:08,496 --> 01:00:10,031
Am I the caretaker ?

786
01:00:10,222 --> 01:00:14,825
I've said a lot of things in haste. When
it comes to practical matters, I'm a dodo.

787
01:00:15,113 --> 01:00:17,511
I can't afford to move
without selling this house.

788
01:00:17,703 --> 01:00:20,867
I've run up too many debts.
It's expensive being sick.

789
01:00:21,154 --> 01:00:25,086
- Nobody's throwing you out in the cold.
- I've been counting on this money.

790
01:00:25,469 --> 01:00:29,592
I haven't been working in two years.
I've used up everything. I've borrowed.

791
01:00:29,976 --> 01:00:32,661
Darling, it's as simple as this:
my plans have changed.

792
01:00:32,948 --> 01:00:35,058
- What ?!
- We want to settle here.

793
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:39,662
Your father and I bought this house.
He'd have wanted it to stay in the family.

794
01:00:39,950 --> 01:00:42,442
- Can't we discuss this later ?
- You're such a phoney !

795
01:00:42,730 --> 01:00:45,702
He bought the house, not you,
and I've kept it going !

796
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:48,867
- Lane !
- Couldn't you have just stayed away ?

797
01:00:49,155 --> 01:00:51,936
Lloyd and I are not young.
We wanna settle.

798
01:00:52,127 --> 01:00:54,909
Who knows ? Maybe we'll hate it
and in a year we'll move.

799
01:00:55,101 --> 01:00:57,402
My life is just not worth all the trouble !

800
01:00:57,594 --> 01:01:01,046
Everyone, just stop it !
Diane, Lane has been through so much.

801
01:01:01,334 --> 01:01:04,690
- Don't get angry, sweetheart.
- She doesn't care what she says to me.

802
01:01:04,977 --> 01:01:07,470
- Like I'm to blame for everything.
- You are !

803
01:01:07,662 --> 01:01:11,307
- OK, calm down.
- I'm calm, Lloyd. I am calm.

804
01:01:11,594 --> 01:01:14,471
We all make mistakes,
but what's done is done.

805
01:01:14,854 --> 01:01:18,018
And if your life didn't turn out,
don't keep accusing me !

806
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:23,676
You're the one who pulled the trigger !
I only said what the lawyers told me to.

807
01:01:28,471 --> 01:01:31,827
- What an absurd thing to say.
- It's not absurd. It's the truth !

808
01:01:33,458 --> 01:01:36,334
I don't think this is the place
to have that discussion.

809
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:40,362
I'm just wrecked !
And you come and go with no guilt !

810
01:01:40,650 --> 01:01:43,335
I don't wanna hear any more of this.
Stop it right now.

811
01:01:43,622 --> 01:01:46,596
It's her excuse for a life wasted,
thrown away to spite me.

812
01:01:46,883 --> 01:01:50,815
- That's not true !
- Yes ! Out of spite ! Pure spite !

813
01:01:51,102 --> 01:01:55,034
Maybe things could have been different
for me if I didn't have to go through that !

814
01:01:55,321 --> 01:01:57,814
- Excuse me. Could we see the attic ?
- Get out of here !

815
01:01:58,006 --> 01:02:00,404
- Pardon me ?
- Get out of here ! Please, just leave !

816
01:02:00,691 --> 01:02:03,472
- Diane ! Relax !
- Get out of here now !

817
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:06,828
- Diane, just relax.
- OK, take the house.

818
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:09,802
- I didn't realise it meant that much to you.
- That's enough.

819
01:02:10,090 --> 01:02:12,486
I said she could have the house !
Now can we go ?

820
01:02:12,678 --> 01:02:14,309
That's enough !

821
01:02:14,501 --> 01:02:19,390
There are things I might do differently
if I had them to do over, but I don't.

822
01:02:19,678 --> 01:02:22,171
My head is splitting open !

823
01:02:34,734 --> 01:02:36,556
OK, I'm sorry for all the fuss.

824
01:02:41,733 --> 01:02:43,651
We all make mistakes.

825
01:03:41,188 --> 01:03:43,585
Lane, can I have the sleeping pills back ?

826
01:03:45,023 --> 01:03:48,284
- I don't know where they are.
- They're not in the medicine cabinet.

827
01:03:48,476 --> 01:03:51,640
- What's the difference ?
- That's the stupidest thing I ever heard.

828
01:03:51,928 --> 01:03:55,189
What are you talking about,
"what's the difference" ? Where are they ?

829
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:57,778
I have no reason to get up tomorrow.

830
01:03:57,970 --> 01:04:00,367
Then you're just gonna
have to make up a reason.

831
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:04,202
What about your plans to move to New
York and set up a photography studio ?

832
01:04:04,490 --> 01:04:06,120
You're so damn angry.

833
01:04:06,312 --> 01:04:09,380
If I haven't made it as
a photographer by now, why would I ?

834
01:04:09,668 --> 01:04:12,832
I don't know. You'll just
have to try harder, won't you ?

835
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:16,763
So...

836
01:04:16,859 --> 01:04:18,969
.. you and Peter are
in love with each other ?

837
01:04:19,161 --> 01:04:22,613
We just became very attracted
to each other. These things happen.

838
01:04:22,901 --> 01:04:27,696
- You knew how much I cared about him.
- It happened by itself. I didn't instigate it.

839
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:32,970
You know, we're all up here isolated from
the world. Unpredictable things happen.

840
01:04:32,970 --> 01:04:35,847
The truth is...

841
01:04:58,094 --> 01:05:00,204
.. I flirted with Peter,...

842
01:05:00,492 --> 01:05:02,313
.. I wanted him to want me,...

843
01:05:03,656 --> 01:05:06,052
.. but I didn't think it would go very far.

844
01:05:07,491 --> 01:05:11,136
I just wanted to know
that I could be wanted.

845
01:05:12,670 --> 01:05:14,683
And he seemed very challenging.

846
01:05:14,875 --> 01:05:19,095
You know, he's very clever
and busy with his novel.

847
01:05:20,341 --> 01:05:23,602
And he's charming and smart and...

848
01:05:26,096 --> 01:05:28,684
Then slowly I began to see how...

849
01:05:32,521 --> 01:05:34,534
.. very vulnerable he is and...

850
01:05:37,698 --> 01:05:39,616
.. he's so uncertain.

851
01:05:41,725 --> 01:05:43,643
And my heart went out to him.

852
01:05:45,370 --> 01:05:47,671
And I began dreaming about him.

853
01:05:49,781 --> 01:05:52,849
What's gonna happen ?
Are you gonna go away with him ?

854
01:05:54,672 --> 01:05:56,589
I can't. No, I can't do that.

855
01:05:56,781 --> 01:06:01,192
It's... It's not so easy
when you're married with... kids.

856
01:06:03,782 --> 01:06:06,178
That's something I wouldn't know.

857
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:08,288
Now give me those pills.

858
01:06:10,878 --> 01:06:14,618
Tomorrow will come
and you'll find some distractions.

859
01:06:15,577 --> 01:06:18,453
You'll get rid of this place.
You'll move back to the city.

860
01:06:18,741 --> 01:06:21,234
You'll work. You'll fall in love.

861
01:06:21,426 --> 01:06:24,207
And maybe it'll work out
and maybe it won't.

862
01:06:25,070 --> 01:06:29,001
But you'll find a million petty things
to keep you going,...

863
01:06:29,385 --> 01:06:32,741
.. and distractions
to keep you from focusing on the...

864
01:06:33,124 --> 01:06:35,138
On the truth.

865
01:06:35,330 --> 01:06:38,302
I don't know what the truth is
and you don't either.

866
01:06:38,590 --> 01:06:41,180
I just wanna swallow all of this Valium.

867
01:06:41,467 --> 01:06:44,441
Well, it's hard to die from Valium.
It takes about a million.

868
01:06:44,823 --> 01:06:48,660
- I'll take 'em all.
- Stop it. Stop it.

869
01:06:48,852 --> 01:06:51,344
You're behaving like a petulant child.

870
01:06:51,632 --> 01:06:55,085
If you really wanted to die,
you would have done that the last time.

871
01:06:55,277 --> 01:06:57,099
I'm so lonely.

872
01:07:02,085 --> 01:07:04,770
OK, stop it, and just give me the pills.

873
01:07:06,017 --> 01:07:08,126
You really wanna die ?

874
01:07:08,317 --> 01:07:10,044
No.

875
01:07:11,961 --> 01:07:13,975
No.

876
01:07:14,167 --> 01:07:17,619
That's my problem.
I... I always wanted to live.

877
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:27,113
Where the hell is everybody ?

878
01:07:27,688 --> 01:07:32,003
Where is everybody ? Boy, the going
gets rough and everybody vanishes.

879
01:07:32,291 --> 01:07:34,784
Lane, we're leaving !

880
01:07:34,976 --> 01:07:38,907
Lane ! God, I hate this outfit. I look
like one of the Hundred Neediest Cases.

881
01:07:39,195 --> 01:07:40,730
You look beautiful.

882
01:07:43,415 --> 01:07:45,525
You know, I'm gonna miss this place.

883
01:07:46,772 --> 01:07:49,456
Hadn't realised how pretty it was up here.

884
01:07:50,223 --> 01:07:52,045
It's so tranquil.

885
01:07:53,196 --> 01:07:55,785
And it's been in the family for so long.

886
01:07:57,415 --> 01:08:00,100
It's the closest thing
I can think of to roots.

887
01:08:02,497 --> 01:08:04,319
It might have been nice.

888
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:08,346
Dear, it's my age talking.

889
01:08:09,978 --> 01:08:11,511
Never mind.

890
01:08:11,799 --> 01:08:13,526
Never mind. It's not in the cards.

891
01:08:13,813 --> 01:08:15,922
Palm Beach will be fine.

892
01:08:16,210 --> 01:08:18,896
The place is unimportant
as long as we're together.

893
01:08:19,086 --> 01:08:20,909
Oh, Lloyd.

894
01:08:21,101 --> 01:08:23,785
Lane, we're leaving for Palm Beach.

895
01:08:23,977 --> 01:08:26,472
If you need me,
we're staying with the Chasens.

896
01:08:26,759 --> 01:08:30,786
And let's not have a wake over what
happened before. It's over and done with.

897
01:08:31,170 --> 01:08:34,142
Life's too short
to dwell on our tragedies. Right ?

898
01:08:35,293 --> 01:08:38,553
Besides, I'm sure we all
said things we're sorry for.

899
01:08:39,416 --> 01:08:41,431
We're all temperamental.

900
01:08:41,621 --> 01:08:44,499
Otherwise, we wouldn't
all be so fascinating.

901
01:08:47,087 --> 01:08:49,101
I'm sorry if I caused you any grief.

902
01:08:50,635 --> 01:08:52,649
OK ? I wasn't thinking.

903
01:08:52,937 --> 01:08:55,335
Oh, well. It's over now.

904
01:08:57,253 --> 01:08:58,979
Lane,...

905
01:08:59,171 --> 01:09:01,184
.. you always liked this,...

906
01:09:01,376 --> 01:09:03,678
.. and I want you to keep it.

907
01:09:03,966 --> 01:09:05,787
Stephanie,...

908
01:09:06,075 --> 01:09:07,513
.. this is for you.

909
01:09:07,801 --> 01:09:11,062
I saw you admiring it
and I'd love you to have it.

910
01:09:11,254 --> 01:09:13,459
Thank you.

911
01:09:13,746 --> 01:09:15,761
Jesus ! Look at my hands.

912
01:09:16,816 --> 01:09:21,898
Now, really, I am too young for liver spots.
Maybe I could merge them into a tan.

913
01:09:22,185 --> 01:09:23,911
What do you think ?

914
01:09:24,103 --> 01:09:27,171
- Can I help with the bags ?
- Oh, my God ! I forgot.

915
01:09:27,363 --> 01:09:31,869
Howard, just in time to say goodbye and
help with the luggage. I'll get the door.

916
01:09:32,253 --> 01:09:36,568
Lloyd, put that hanging piece on top,
I beg you. Everything'll be mussed.

917
01:09:36,856 --> 01:09:39,255
Thanks, Howard.
Terrific. The door's open.

918
01:09:39,446 --> 01:09:42,706
Lane, let them get it, honey.
Come here. Come here.

919
01:09:43,090 --> 01:09:47,021
Now... No, never mind. You know where
we're gonna be, with the Chasens,...

920
01:09:47,405 --> 01:09:51,624
.. so if you need me for anything - your
hair looks just darling down like that -

921
01:09:52,008 --> 01:09:53,925
.. you call me. D'you hear me ? OK.

922
01:09:54,021 --> 01:09:56,995
And tell Peter that
I've got to rethink my memoirs.

923
01:09:57,283 --> 01:09:59,871
If I come up with a fresh approach,
then I'll call him.

924
01:10:00,063 --> 01:10:01,885
Goodbye. Be a good girl.

925
01:10:02,077 --> 01:10:05,241
Oh, God. Have you got my make-up kit ?
It's got my diaphragm in it.

926
01:10:05,433 --> 01:10:08,885
Isn't it silly ? I still travel with it.
It's like a lucky charm.

927
01:10:09,269 --> 01:10:12,529
Maybe I should donate it
to the antique fair !

928
01:10:22,022 --> 01:10:23,844
Will I see you again ?

929
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:30,077
I think you should leave.

930
01:10:30,844 --> 01:10:33,722
I'm going to stay with Lane
and then go back home.

931
01:10:39,667 --> 01:10:43,311
It's funny. You meet somebody
under strange circumstances.

932
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:50,791
You fall in love and then
you go off in separate directions.

933
01:10:51,941 --> 01:10:54,434
Peter, please don't make this hard for me.

934
01:10:55,489 --> 01:10:57,694
- Please.
- I feel so empty.

935
01:11:01,626 --> 01:11:06,708
You haven't even gone yet and I feel like
I've lost something I'll never find again.

936
01:11:06,708 --> 01:11:09,586
I'm so disappointed in myself.

937
01:11:21,189 --> 01:11:23,011
Steffie.

938
01:11:29,819 --> 01:11:32,409
Time will pass
and you'll forget this summer.

939
01:11:35,861 --> 01:11:37,778
And you ? Will you forget it ?

940
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:43,244
I'll try.

941
01:11:44,683 --> 01:11:46,504
It won't be easy, but I'll try.

942
01:12:13,547 --> 01:12:17,287
Now she's off to Palm Beach
as though nothing had happened.

943
01:12:22,368 --> 01:12:24,478
Well, I really should be going, too.

944
01:12:25,725 --> 01:12:27,451
My debts.

945
01:12:27,738 --> 01:12:29,561
I have to manage the final sale.

946
01:12:31,574 --> 01:12:33,492
All the details.

947
01:12:37,807 --> 01:12:40,780
Lane, I want so badly
to tell you not to worry.

948
01:12:41,068 --> 01:12:42,698
Howard.

949
01:12:42,986 --> 01:12:46,822
And that I'll take care of you,
that nothing would make me happier.

950
01:12:48,068 --> 01:12:50,657
I've gotten so used to
having you in my life.

951
01:12:52,192 --> 01:12:56,508
- You're all that gives it meaning now.
- Howard, don't. Don't.

952
01:12:57,563 --> 01:12:59,096
- I'm sure that...
- I can't.

953
01:12:59,288 --> 01:13:01,110
.. when you leave here...

954
01:13:02,836 --> 01:13:04,754
.. I'll never see you again.

955
01:13:07,247 --> 01:13:09,069
But I really did grow to love you.

956
01:13:12,712 --> 01:13:14,535
Lane.

957
01:13:16,740 --> 01:13:18,562
I came to say goodbye.

958
01:13:21,534 --> 01:13:24,796
I think it's better
if I head back to the city tonight.

959
01:13:25,083 --> 01:13:26,905
You haven't finished your book.

960
01:13:29,686 --> 01:13:31,508
It's finished.

961
01:13:33,234 --> 01:13:35,056
What a sad tone in your voice.

962
01:13:38,603 --> 01:13:40,906
I loved all the time we spent together.

963
01:13:44,358 --> 01:13:47,618
And I appreciate your faith in me and...

964
01:13:49,632 --> 01:13:51,454
.. the encouragement.

965
01:13:54,235 --> 01:13:56,344
I'm sorry I couldn't live up to it.

966
01:14:04,303 --> 01:14:06,029
Well...

967
01:14:07,659 --> 01:14:09,578
Take care of her, Howard.

968
01:14:09,578 --> 01:14:12,455
- Hi.
- Hi.

969
01:15:14,306 --> 01:15:16,032
Would you like some tea ?

970
01:15:16,224 --> 01:15:17,854
No.

971
01:15:25,046 --> 01:15:27,251
- It's chilly.
- Yeah.

972
01:15:28,114 --> 01:15:30,416
It was chilly when I got up this morning.

973
01:15:38,470 --> 01:15:41,060
In a few days it'll be September.

974
01:15:41,252 --> 01:15:43,170
I know.

975
01:15:44,225 --> 01:15:47,101
There are so many things to do,
selling a house.

976
01:15:49,882 --> 01:15:52,184
It'll keep you busy. That's good.

977
01:15:54,965 --> 01:15:56,883
When do you have to go home ?

978
01:15:58,225 --> 01:16:00,815
In a couple of days I'll go back.

979
01:16:01,006 --> 01:16:04,170
The kids need school supplies
and new shoes.

980
01:16:06,568 --> 01:16:08,773
- Sweet kids.
- Yeah.

981
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:15,678
Oh, Steffie.

982
01:16:19,321 --> 01:16:23,157
Soon you'll leave here and
you'll start all over again in New York.

983
01:16:25,459 --> 01:16:28,336
There'll be a million things
to keep you busy.

984
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:33,418
It's gonna be OK.
