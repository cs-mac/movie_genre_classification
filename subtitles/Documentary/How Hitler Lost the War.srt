of the Soviet empire,

2
00:02:03,341 --> 00:02:06,090
culminating in the crumbling
of the Berlin Wall,

3
00:02:06,157 --> 00:02:09,224
is one of the great events
of world history.

4
00:02:09,294 --> 00:02:11,083
There were many heroes
in this battle,

5
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,077
but to Charlie Wilson
must go this
special recognition.

6
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:20,291
Just 13 years ago,
the Soviet Army appeared
to be invincible.

7
00:02:21,197 --> 00:02:24,132
But Charlie, undeterred,

8
00:02:24,205 --> 00:02:26,213
engineered
a lethal body blow

9
00:02:26,285 --> 00:02:28,674
that weakened
the Communist empire.

10
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,506
Without Charlie,

11
00:02:30,574 --> 00:02:34,664
history would be hugely
and sadly different.

12
00:02:35,437 --> 00:02:36,844
And so,
for the first time,

13
00:02:36,909 --> 00:02:41,131

our highest recognition,

14
00:02:41,197 --> 00:02:43,139
that of Honored Colleague.

You know what I'm saying?

21
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,124
Like Dallas but set
in Washington.

22
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:18,921
Yeah.
And you should
say it just like that.

23
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:20,364
When I pitch it.
You should say it just...

24
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,918
"Oh, this is fucking great."
You should say it
just like that.

Dallas set
in Washington D.C.

26

You know,
with the intrigue
and the power plays

27
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,581
and the overt
natural sex.

28
00:03:28,653 --> 00:03:29,995
The glamour,
the power.

what I'm saying?
PAUL: It's fucking Dallas.

CRYSTAL: Or,
or Falcon Crest.

Yes.

32

That's set in Washington.

33

Say it to Charlie
like that.

L'll make sure I'm home.

I can make it happen?

about how any
of that works.

you would listen to him.

to people who haven't
acted professionally
before?

that's just the
same thing.

this seriously, please?

tell me something?

could you turn that up?

Still, could you just
grab the remote there

the volume button?

ammunition for this?

go over to the Gulf,

156
00:07:52,114 --> 00:07:53,835
He wants to talk
to you about a creche.

157
00:07:53,903 --> 00:07:55,792
What, a nativity scene
with baby Jesus?

158
00:07:55,857 --> 00:07:57,929
Yeah, it's on public property,
and the city's making
him move it.

159
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,495
Shit. I thought
he was just coming in

160
00:07:59,568 --> 00:08:01,325
to get his picture took,
you know?
Congressman.

161
00:08:01,393 --> 00:08:02,602
Yeah?
You're exactly
who I need to speak to.

162
00:08:02,672 --> 00:08:03,621
You have a moment?
Sure.

163
00:08:03,695 --> 00:08:05,419
Tip asked me
to talk to you.
Okay.

164
00:08:05,488 --> 00:08:07,277
He wanted me to talk to you
about John Murtha.

165
00:08:07,344 --> 00:08:09,865
Go ahead.
The prosecutor's
gonna go after him.

166
00:08:09,937 --> 00:08:11,309
Well, they ain't
gonna find anything.

167
00:08:11,374 --> 00:08:13,546
John Murtha's as clean
as my mother's kitchen floor.

168
00:08:13,615 --> 00:08:14,957
Yeah, but Tip would
like to put you

169
00:08:15,024 --> 00:08:16,518
on the Ethics Committee
just the same.

170
00:08:16,591 --> 00:08:18,218
You're kidding.
No.

171
00:08:18,288 --> 00:08:20,328
Well, Jesus, Donnelly,
everyone in town knows

172
00:08:20,401 --> 00:08:21,678
I'm on the other side
of that issue.

173
00:08:21,745 --> 00:08:23,752
Ethics?
Yeah!

174
00:08:23,824 --> 00:08:26,608
Well, the Speaker would
like to put you on the
committee anyway.

175
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:30,054
Okay. Well, if anyone asks
what the hell I'm doing
on the Ethics Committee,

176
00:08:30,127 --> 00:08:32,745
we'll just tell them
I like chasing women
and drinking whiskey

177
00:08:32,815 --> 00:08:34,856
and the Speaker felt
we were underrepresented.

178
00:08:34,928 --> 00:08:36,521
One man, one vote.
Exactly.

179
00:08:36,592 --> 00:08:37,901
Tip's gonna want
to return the favor.

180
00:08:37,968 --> 00:08:39,823
Tuesday, right?
That is Tuesday, yes.

181
00:08:39,888 --> 00:08:41,383
So if anything comes up
that you'd like me

182
00:08:41,457 --> 00:08:42,504
to speak with him
about, please...

183
00:08:42,577 --> 00:08:43,592
Yes.

184
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,064
Yes!

185
00:08:45,585 --> 00:08:48,104
I'd like to be on
the Board of Directors
of the Kennedy Center.

186
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,189
Charlie.
I'm sorry?

187
00:08:49,264 --> 00:08:52,135
Turns out Congress appoints
the Board of Directors
of the Kennedy Center.

188
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:55,983
It's a great place to take
a date, and I can never
afford the tickets.

189
00:08:56,049 --> 00:08:57,838
Consider it done.
Excellent.

190
00:08:58,802 --> 00:08:59,784
Go vote.

191
00:08:59,857 --> 00:09:02,705
Another few minutes.
Let's see what's
on the wires.

192
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:05,353
Why can't you wait
for newspapers like
everybody else?

193
00:09:05,425 --> 00:09:07,596
'Cause I think it's productive
to know today's news today.

194
00:09:07,665 --> 00:09:10,119
And it makes me one day
smarter than you,
which I enjoy as well.

195
00:09:10,192 --> 00:09:11,621
I know you do.

196
00:09:11,698 --> 00:09:13,105
You don't think
that's a little crazy?

197
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:15,242
Pan Am and Eastern
are lowering their fares.

198
00:09:15,314 --> 00:09:17,103
'Cause of Braniff.
What's a little crazy?

199
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,544
Joining the Board
of the Kennedy Center

200
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:20,465
so you can get free tickets
to the Royal Ballet of...

201
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:21,578
Hold on.
What?

202
00:09:21,651 --> 00:09:23,307
AP story out of Kabul.

203
00:09:23,376 --> 00:09:24,686
Uzbekistan?

204
00:09:24,881 --> 00:09:26,223
Afghanistan.

205
00:09:26,993 --> 00:09:30,310
Russia, Afghanistan,
Pakistan, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia,

206
00:09:30,385 --> 00:09:32,174
Jordan, Israel, Egypt.

207
00:09:35,026 --> 00:09:36,968
Jim Van Wagenen's
our point man
on black approps

208
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:38,351
for the Defense
Subcommittee?

209
00:09:38,418 --> 00:09:39,434
Yeah.

210
00:09:39,507 --> 00:09:41,644
Have him come to my office
as soon as possible.

211
00:09:41,713 --> 00:09:43,120
How am I voting on this?
BONNIE: Yes.

212
00:09:43,185 --> 00:09:44,298
You sure?
Yes.

213
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:45,798
The Boy Scouts?

214
00:09:45,873 --> 00:09:48,362
Jim Van Wagenen.
Get him and show him
that wire story.

215
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:50,189
Yes, sir.
You are the man
I wanted to talk to.

216
00:09:52,018 --> 00:09:53,228
The Congressman will
be here in a moment.

217
00:09:53,297 --> 00:09:54,923
He's just coming up
from a vote.

218
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:56,401
I'm sure it's
an important one.

219
00:09:56,466 --> 00:09:57,546
No. Not really.

220
00:09:58,032 --> 00:09:59,942
SUZANNE: So, Marla, can you
fit this into his schedule
next week?

221
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:00,965
(PHONE RINGING)

222
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,634
RECEPTIONIST:
Charlie Wilson's office.
Good morning.

223
00:10:02,705 --> 00:10:03,817
The third...

224
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,028
It is? How are you?

225
00:10:06,098 --> 00:10:07,341
BONNIE: Suzanne, can you
help me with this?
Okay.

226
00:10:07,409 --> 00:10:09,165
SUZANNE: L'll be right back.
RECEPTIONIST: L'll have
him do it.

227
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,183
Okay, bye-bye.

228
00:10:10,258 --> 00:10:11,568
LARRY: Miss?
Yes, sir?

229
00:10:11,634 --> 00:10:15,725
It seems to me, looking
around, that it's almost
all women working here,

230
00:10:15,794 --> 00:10:18,094
and that they're
all very pretty.

231
00:10:18,321 --> 00:10:19,269
Is that common?

232
00:10:19,345 --> 00:10:20,393
(LAUGHS) Well,

233
00:10:20,466 --> 00:10:22,605
Congressman Wilson,
he has an expression.

234
00:10:22,674 --> 00:10:27,147
He says, " You can teach them
to type, but you can't teach
them to grow tits."

235
00:10:27,378 --> 00:10:28,687
Well, that's charming.

236
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,379
Larry!
Congressman!

237
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:34,126
No, no, no. For $5,000
every two years you get
to call me Charlie.

238
00:10:34,193 --> 00:10:37,903
And for 10,000, you can call
me Betty Sue and l'll clean
out your rain gutters.

239
00:10:37,969 --> 00:10:38,951
This is my daughter, Jane.

240
00:10:39,025 --> 00:10:40,236
Well, now I remember Jane.
Two-L at SMU.

241
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,833
Charlie Wilson's office.
Good morning.

242
00:10:41,906 --> 00:10:43,466
Welcome to the
United States Congress.

243
00:10:43,538 --> 00:10:45,774
Hey, I'm gonna
talk to your daddy
for a couple of seconds.

244
00:10:45,842 --> 00:10:47,915
Larry, can we
get you a drink?

245
00:10:47,986 --> 00:10:49,165
It's 10:00 in the morning.

246
00:10:49,234 --> 00:10:51,308
Well, fair enough,
I guess.

247
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:53,551
Grab a seat.

248
00:10:54,257 --> 00:10:57,106
Now, this situation
with the creche, I want
to know all about it.

249
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:58,118
Well, sir,

250
00:10:58,194 --> 00:10:59,142
(CLEARS THROAT)

251
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:02,536
Every single year
since the world was young,

252
00:11:03,314 --> 00:11:07,024
the firehouse in the
Nacogdoches Township
has displayed a creche.

253
00:11:07,091 --> 00:11:10,385
Now, the ACLU has filed suit
against the township

254
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:13,799
for displaying
a religious symbol
on public property.

255
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:15,946
It's Christmas time.
It's a creche.

256
00:11:16,018 --> 00:11:18,637
I could understand
if we were in
gosh-darn Scarsdale,

257
00:11:18,707 --> 00:11:22,188
but this is east Texas,
and I want to know
who we're offending.

258
00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:24,016
Except two lawyers
from the ACLU.

259
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:27,378
That is a terribly interesting
and complicated question.

260
00:11:27,443 --> 00:11:29,198
Let me make
this suggestion, though.

261
00:11:29,266 --> 00:11:31,984
There's a church about
a block and a half

262
00:11:32,051 --> 00:11:34,865
from that firehouse,
First Baptist Church
of Nacogdoches.

263
00:11:34,931 --> 00:11:37,516
They've got
a beautiful rolling lawn
out there in front.

264
00:11:37,586 --> 00:11:39,309
No, no. This
is a Christian
country, Charlie,

265
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:41,267
founded
on Christian values.
Sure.

266
00:11:41,331 --> 00:11:43,305
We welcome other faiths
to worship as they wish,

267
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,647
but when you can't
put a nativity scene

268
00:11:45,713 --> 00:11:48,680
in front of a firehouse
at Christmas time
in Nacogdoches Township,

269
00:11:48,754 --> 00:11:50,128
something's gone
terribly wrong.

270
00:11:50,194 --> 00:11:52,201
Well, that's not
really true, Larry.

271
00:11:52,273 --> 00:11:54,762
You could move that creche
over to that church

272
00:11:54,834 --> 00:11:55,783
and everything's just fine.

273
00:11:55,858 --> 00:11:57,004
That's not the point!

274
00:11:57,074 --> 00:12:00,075
Okay. Why don't
we just start back
at the beginning?

275
00:12:00,147 --> 00:12:01,293
What can I do for you?

276
00:12:01,364 --> 00:12:03,434
You can intervene
in the case against
the creche committee.

277
00:12:03,506 --> 00:12:04,650
Intervene? How?

278
00:12:04,721 --> 00:12:06,184
You appointed the judge.

279
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:07,503
I don't appoint judges.

280
00:12:07,571 --> 00:12:09,359
I just made a recommendation
to the President.

281
00:12:09,426 --> 00:12:10,408
Uh-huh.

282
00:12:10,482 --> 00:12:11,726
I think you and I both know
what that means.

283

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

284
00:12:12,851 --> 00:12:15,568
I cannot just call up
a judge and tell him
what to do.

285
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:17,458
Why?
Well, 'Cause
it's against a shitload

286
00:12:17,524 --> 00:12:19,695
of really good laws, Gary.

287
00:12:19,763 --> 00:12:21,452
Larry.
Larry.

288
00:12:21,522 --> 00:12:26,313
I got to go talk to this guy
out here for a second.
Will you excuse me?

289
00:12:26,386 --> 00:12:27,531
By the way,
I love Jesus Christ

290
00:12:27,603 --> 00:12:29,163
and his mother Mary
as much as anybody.

291
00:12:29,235 --> 00:12:32,683
About 38 churches you could
move that creche to,
everybody lives.

292
00:12:32,851 --> 00:12:33,866
Give me a call.
Okay.

293
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,085
I love Chivas.

294
00:12:35,156 --> 00:12:36,847
Jane, how are you?

295
00:12:36,915 --> 00:12:38,477
You need a cup of coffee?

296
00:12:38,548 --> 00:12:40,816
Something to drink?
Anything like that? Okay.
Mmm-mmm.

297
00:12:40,882 --> 00:12:42,605
Jim.
Congressman.

298
00:12:42,674 --> 00:12:44,497
You see Lederer's
AP story out of Kabul?

299
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:45,971
Yeah.
We're reading this
story every day now.

300
00:12:46,035 --> 00:12:47,017
You see Dan Rather
last night?

301
00:12:47,091 --> 00:12:48,520
Yeah. I did.

302
00:12:48,596 --> 00:12:50,800
Tell me something.
What is the Defense
Subcommittee's budget

303
00:12:50,868 --> 00:12:52,908
for covert ops against
the Communists
in Afghanistan?

304
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,125
All in?
All in.

305
00:12:54,196 --> 00:12:55,724
It's 5 million.

306
00:12:57,266 --> 00:13:00,300
Well, they can't
shoot down helicopters

I was the best officer

he ever served in port with.

to double it.

Well, shit, Joanne,
I don't know what
you're talking about,

372
00:15:33,076 --> 00:15:35,346
and if I did,
it'd be classified,

373
00:15:35,605 --> 00:15:37,012
and I'd wonder
where you got
your information

you didn't have
a girlfriend.

I don't.
This isn't my girlfriend.

Thank you, Joanne.

396
00:16:33,205 --> 00:16:36,553
Okay. I know it was difficult
for you to come in here,
hat in hand.

397
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:40,459
That's not the kind
of upbringing, I guess,
is the word I'm looking for.

398
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:43,184
It's not the kind of man
you are. I understand that.

399
00:16:43,254 --> 00:16:46,321
I'm not looking to humiliate
you or exact a price
in any way,

400
00:16:46,392 --> 00:16:48,214
so why don't you
just apologize?

401
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:50,666
We'll call it water under
the dam, and we'll go
about our business.

402
00:16:50,741 --> 00:16:52,651
Excuse me,
what the fuck?

403
00:16:53,558 --> 00:16:55,468
What?
What the fuck
are you talking about?

404
00:16:55,542 --> 00:16:57,429
Clair George said you
were coming in here
to apologize.

405
00:16:57,494 --> 00:16:59,915
No, I'm supposed to come
in here so you could
apologize to me.

406
00:16:59,989 --> 00:17:01,680
According to whom?
Clair George.

407
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,598
You told me to go fuck myself.
I'm supposed to apologize
to you?

408
00:17:04,662 --> 00:17:07,628
Also, water goes over
a dam and under a bridge,
you poncy schoolboy.

409
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,865
Clearly there's been
a miscommunication between
Clair George and somebody.

410
00:17:10,934 --> 00:17:12,078
Excuse me.
Yes?

411
00:17:12,149 --> 00:17:13,360
Does this look all right?
It's fine.

412
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:14,476
Thank you.
I can sand it
down a little.

413
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,654
I, I don't know.
I have no fucking idea
who this guy is.

414
00:17:16,725 --> 00:17:19,344
He is here to fix the glass
that you broke the last time
you were here.

415
00:17:19,415 --> 00:17:21,804
Could you just excuse us
for a second there?
Yes.

416
00:17:21,878 --> 00:17:22,860
You tell me to go
fuck myself

417
00:17:22,934 --> 00:17:24,428
and I'm supposed
to apologize?
You break my window,

418
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:26,323
I'm supposed to apologize?
The Helsinki job was mine!

419
00:17:26,389 --> 00:17:28,910
The Helsinki job was not
yours. If it was yours,
you'd be in Helsinki.

420
00:17:28,982 --> 00:17:30,356
Alan Wolfe stood
in this office!
Alan Wolfe

421
00:17:30,421 --> 00:17:31,883
is no longer the Director.
Yeah, it was on the books!

422
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:34,642
Alan Wolfe is no
longer the Director
of European Operations.

423
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,019
He does not make
those appointments. I do.

424
00:17:36,086 --> 00:17:37,713
Promises were made.
Not by me.

425
00:17:37,782 --> 00:17:39,987

the company for 24 years.

in Greece for 15.

take him prisoner.

the Hellenic army.

I've neutralized
champions of Communism.

430
00:17:49,462 --> 00:17:52,626
I've spent the past
three years learning
Finnish!

431
00:17:52,694 --> 00:17:54,581
Which should come in handy
here in Virginia!

432
00:17:54,647 --> 00:17:56,535
And I'm never,
ever, sick at sea.

433
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:59,861
So I want to know
why I'm not gonna be
your Helsinki station chief.

434
00:17:59,927 --> 00:18:01,649
You're coarse.
Excuse me?

435
00:18:01,749 --> 00:18:04,205
For Helsinki, I need someone
with diplomatic skills.

436
00:18:04,278 --> 00:18:05,456
You don't have them.
Is that right?

437
00:18:05,526 --> 00:18:07,468
That is right. And I
don't know why the hell
I didn't fire you

438
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:08,590
when you broke
my fucking window!

439
00:18:08,662 --> 00:18:10,451
Oh, yes, sure
you do, Cravely.

440
00:18:10,518 --> 00:18:12,493
Look, Gust...
Yeah, you're fucking
Roger's fiancee

441
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:13,811
and you know I know.

442
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:17,458
I'm not... I'm not even
gonna dignify that with
a response.

443
00:18:17,528 --> 00:18:19,381
Yeah, yeah, you're
dignifying her in the ass

444
00:18:19,446 --> 00:18:21,301
at the Jefferson Hotel,
room 1210.

445
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:24,149
But let me ask you.
The 3,000 agents
Turner fired

446
00:18:24,214 --> 00:18:26,319
was that because they lacked
diplomatic skills as well?

447
00:18:26,391 --> 00:18:28,180
You're referring
to Admiral Stansfield Turner?

448
00:18:28,248 --> 00:18:29,262
Yeah, the 3,000 agents.

449
00:18:29,335 --> 00:18:32,151
Each and every goddamn one
of them first or second
generation Americans.

450
00:18:32,216 --> 00:18:34,605
Is that because they lack
the proper diplomatic skills?

451
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:37,044
Or did Turner not
think it was a good idea
to have spies

452
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:40,307
who could speak the
same language as the people
they're fucking spying on?

453
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,797
Well, I'm sorry,
but you can hardly
blame the Director

454
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,740
for questioning the loyalty
to America of people that
are just barely Americans

455
00:18:45,814 --> 00:18:47,724
in the first place.
Yeah, well, I'd like
to take a moment

456
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:49,326
to review the several ways
in which you're a douchebag.

457
00:18:49,399 --> 00:18:51,374
Get the fuck
out of my office!
Yes, sir.

458
00:18:51,447 --> 00:18:52,691
Before I end
your career, asshole.

459
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:53,740
Yes, sir!

460
00:18:53,814 --> 00:18:56,814
Yeah, my friend,
I'm gonna need
you for a second.

461
00:18:57,366 --> 00:18:58,314
(WOMAN SCREAMS)

462
00:18:58,646 --> 00:18:59,956
God damn it!

463
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:01,716
My loyalty?

464
00:19:02,551 --> 00:19:05,071
For 24 years,
people have been
trying to kill me.

465
00:19:05,142 --> 00:19:06,451
People who know how.

466
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:09,389
Now, do you think that's
because my dad was
a Greek soda pop maker

467
00:19:09,463 --> 00:19:11,763
or do you think that's
because I'm an American spy?

468
00:19:11,829 --> 00:19:14,252
Go fuck yourself,
you fucking child.

469
00:19:20,183 --> 00:19:21,492
How was I?

470
00:19:22,455 --> 00:19:23,503
Thank you.

471
00:19:24,439 --> 00:19:27,822
There's a woman in
Aliquippa, Pennsylvania,
named Nitsa.

472
00:19:28,504 --> 00:19:29,996
And she thinks
she's a witch.

473
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,372
Yeah, she offered
to put a curse on
Cravely for me.

474
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:33,486
Yeah?

475
00:19:33,654 --> 00:19:34,832
And she...

476
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:39,060
She asked me do I want
a professional curse
or a health curse.

477
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,137
"If it's a health curse,
I can do it right away,

478
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:43,794
"but a professional curse
takes longer."

479
00:19:43,864 --> 00:19:46,799
Well, I'm living proof
she's right about that.

480
00:19:47,446 --> 00:19:49,072
Did you get the brownie?
Oh, no, sir, I didn't.

481
00:19:49,143 --> 00:19:50,420
I got you.

482
00:19:52,407 --> 00:19:55,473
I'm reading transcripts
of phone conversations

483
00:19:55,543 --> 00:19:57,169
between French
and German generals

484
00:19:57,239 --> 00:20:00,469
arguing over office space
at NATO headquarters

485
00:20:00,537 --> 00:20:04,115
and analyzing wiretaps
out of Mercury Bay,
New Zealand.

486
00:20:04,185 --> 00:20:07,664
You know,
historically, a hotbed
of anti-American activity.

487
00:20:08,344 --> 00:20:11,378
Yeah, nobody will come
near me. I'm in the weeds.

488
00:20:12,376 --> 00:20:14,678
You know,
a typical case officer

489
00:20:15,032 --> 00:20:19,539
doesn't walk into his
boss's office and tell him
to go fuck himself. Twice.

490
00:20:19,609 --> 00:20:22,162
I just told you,
I paid a witch in
Pennsylvania $80

491
00:20:22,233 --> 00:20:24,817
to put a curse
on Henry Cravely for me.

492
00:20:25,399 --> 00:20:27,472
Do I sound like
a typical case officer?
No.

493
00:20:27,544 --> 00:20:30,163
Well, then,
let's assume I'm not.

494
00:20:30,232 --> 00:20:32,304
Listen. If you're really
not doing anything,

495
00:20:32,376 --> 00:20:33,902
why don't you come upstairs
and work with us?

496
00:20:33,976 --> 00:20:35,055
What are you doing?

497
00:20:35,127 --> 00:20:36,502
Killing Russians.

498
00:20:37,816 --> 00:20:41,873
Our next slave girl
is a Texas rose named
Ashley Rensler.

(CROWD CHEERING)

500
00:20:42,999 --> 00:20:46,545
Ashley is prelaw at U. T.,
and her three sorority sisters

501
00:20:46,615 --> 00:20:49,550
from Delta Delta Delta
will wash your car
or truck

00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:52,592
in special outfits
they have chosen
for the occasion.

503
00:20:52,663 --> 00:20:56,974
So, who wants their wheels
cleaned clean as a whistle
by a 19-year-old lawyer

504
00:20:57,049 --> 00:20:59,120
and her three friends
from Tri-Delt?

505
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:00,139
(CROWD CHEERING)

506
00:21:00,215 --> 00:21:02,932
I have 10,000,
who'll give me 11?
11, 11, I got 11.

507
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,822
I got 15 right here.
Thank you very much.

508
00:21:04,887 --> 00:21:07,059
Oh, my God,
she is a Minute Woman.

509
00:21:07,128 --> 00:21:08,852
No, she's a Tri-Delt.

510
00:21:09,752 --> 00:21:11,541
No, she is a
Minute Woman, Charlie.

511
00:21:11,608 --> 00:21:12,819
Oh. Joanne.

512
00:21:12,889 --> 00:21:16,565
Yeah, she's
a direct descendant of
George Washington's sister.

513
00:21:16,727 --> 00:21:19,313
Says she had a great uncle
who was killed at the Alamo.

514
00:21:19,384 --> 00:21:22,352
Former Miss Cotton Bowl.
Had her own local
television talk show.

515
00:21:22,424 --> 00:21:25,490
Look. Pakistan's
Honorary Consul
to Houston, Texas.

516
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,902
How's that
for a title, huh?

517
00:21:26,968 --> 00:21:30,002
This is
an ultra-right wing group
of anti-Communist fanatics.

518
00:21:30,073 --> 00:21:31,480
They're not
ultra-right wing.

519
00:21:31,546 --> 00:21:33,236
What are they?

520
00:21:33,305 --> 00:21:34,994
Well, they're
ultra-right wing.

521
00:21:35,063 --> 00:21:37,366
What are you doing
hanging around
this woman?

522
00:21:37,432 --> 00:21:40,945
Did you hear me say
she was a former
Miss Cotton Bowl?

523
00:21:41,016 --> 00:21:42,161
You are unbelievable.

524
00:21:42,232 --> 00:21:43,345
Oh, come on.
You're gonna love her.

525
00:21:43,417 --> 00:21:45,272
And, you know, one of
the things she's trying
to do over there

526
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:46,799
is liberate the women.

527
00:21:46,874 --> 00:21:49,591
And what better
way than through
a slave girl auction?

528
00:21:49,657 --> 00:21:50,835
JOANNE: Charlie.

529
00:21:53,433 --> 00:21:55,735
So sorry for keeping
you waiting.

530
00:21:55,801 --> 00:21:57,840
Oh, it's no problem,
Joanne.

531
00:21:58,393 --> 00:21:59,342
This is Bonnie Bach.

532
00:21:59,417 --> 00:22:01,140
So nice to meet you.

533
00:22:04,217 --> 00:22:08,309
It's a pleasure meeting you,
Mrs. Herring. This is
a wonderful party.

534
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:11,983
Why don't you
give us a few moments?

535
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:14,292
Yes, sir.

536
00:22:14,905 --> 00:22:19,444
Oh, Bobbie, if you could
ask someone for a Bombay
martini up, very dry?

537
00:22:19,513 --> 00:22:21,521
Oh, I'm not
a slave girl,
actually.

538
00:22:21,593 --> 00:22:23,665
I'm the Congressman's
administrative assistant.

539
00:22:23,737 --> 00:22:25,013
Isn't that wonderful
for you.

540
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,259
Yes.

541
00:22:26,329 --> 00:22:29,077
Two olives, please.
Tell them it's for me,
they'll know.

542
00:22:29,144 --> 00:22:30,420
Certainly.

543
00:22:32,345 --> 00:22:33,871
She doesn't like me.

544
00:22:33,944 --> 00:22:34,992
Everybody likes you.

545
00:22:35,065 --> 00:22:36,439
She's a liberal.

546
00:22:36,504 --> 00:22:38,196
Well, I'm a liberal.

547
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:40,341
Not where it counts.

548
00:22:40,857 --> 00:22:42,102
Have you seen the house?

549
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:45,137
Well, I've seen
the downstairs,
what's upstairs?

550
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:46,484
Fourteen bedrooms.

551
00:22:46,552 --> 00:22:47,926
I should have a look.

552
00:22:47,993 --> 00:22:48,975
What did you think
of the movie?

553
00:22:49,048 --> 00:22:50,674
What, that thing
we just saw?

554
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,719
The reason
for the party, yes.

555
00:22:52,793 --> 00:22:55,445
Well, I'm not an expert
in the field or anything,

556
00:22:55,513 --> 00:22:58,231
but the production quality
seemed amateurish to me.

557
00:22:58,298 --> 00:22:59,727
Yeah, I'm not
submitting the thing

558
00:22:59,801 --> 00:23:01,940
for a Golden Globe
nomination, Charlie.

559
00:23:02,009 --> 00:23:04,179
You know what
I'm talking about.

560
00:23:04,248 --> 00:23:06,769
Well, as a member
of the Defense Subcommittee,

561
00:23:06,841 --> 00:23:08,118
did you think
I wasn't aware

562
00:23:08,185 --> 00:23:10,290
that the Soviet Union's
invaded Afghanistan?

563
00:23:10,361 --> 00:23:12,216
Yes, I believe
my government is aware,

564
00:23:12,281 --> 00:23:14,671
but I was wondering
if they were thinking
of doing anything about it

565
00:23:14,746 --> 00:23:17,812
other than boycotting
the Olympics, which
I think you'll agree,

566
00:23:17,882 --> 00:23:19,376
was a fairly
impotent response

567
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:21,553
to the greatest
national security
threat we've faced

568
00:23:21,624 --> 00:23:22,966
since the
Cuban Missile Crisis.

569
00:23:23,032 --> 00:23:26,066
Well, I don't think making
more movies about it
is gonna do the trick,

570
00:23:26,137 --> 00:23:27,665
if that's what
you're asking.

571
00:23:27,737 --> 00:23:28,948
It's not.

572
00:23:30,105 --> 00:23:32,789
Exactly how much power
do you have as a member
of the Subcommittee?

573
00:23:32,858 --> 00:23:34,288
Which one? I'm on two.

574
00:23:34,362 --> 00:23:35,442
Foreign Ops.

575
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:38,514
Eight members and myself
hand out 11 billion
in foreign assistance.

576
00:23:38,587 --> 00:23:40,822
And what about
the Defense Subcommittee?

577
00:23:40,889 --> 00:23:41,837
Our budget is hidden.

578
00:23:41,914 --> 00:23:43,223
It is also unlimited.

579
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:44,696
Yeah.

580
00:23:46,042 --> 00:23:48,181
Would you like
to see my room?

581
00:23:48,314 --> 00:23:49,361
Yeah.

582
00:23:49,435 --> 00:23:50,417
(WHIMPERING)

583
00:23:50,491 --> 00:23:54,287
So, unless I'm wrong,
and that would be
unusual for me,

584
00:23:55,195 --> 00:23:57,137
you sit at the intersection
of the State Department,

585
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:59,097
the Pentagon and the CIA.

586
00:23:59,546 --> 00:24:02,416
You meet in a soundproof room
underneath the Capitol,

587
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:05,687
and you preside over
a secret and unlimited
budget

588
00:24:05,754 --> 00:24:09,234
for the three agencies
you would need to conduct
a covert war.

589
00:24:09,306 --> 00:24:10,867
Isn't that right?

590
00:24:10,938 --> 00:24:13,076
I also have seats
at the Kennedy Center.

591
00:24:13,147 --> 00:24:16,374
Isn't that how you were able
to double the CIA budget
for black approps

592
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,775
in Afghanistan
just by saying so?

593
00:24:18,841 --> 00:24:22,322
Why are you only asking me
questions you already
know the answers to?

594
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:25,144
Why is Congress
saying one thing
and doing nothing?

595
00:24:25,211 --> 00:24:27,033
Well, tradition mostly.

596
00:24:33,145 --> 00:24:34,422
Come here.

597
00:24:35,002 --> 00:24:36,049
Okay.

598
00:24:44,698 --> 00:24:48,725
I do not understand
the energy women
have after sex.

599
00:24:48,796 --> 00:24:51,511
You're dancing around,
you're baking a pie.

600
00:24:51,578 --> 00:24:53,400
JOANNE: Charlie?
Yes, ma'am?

601
00:24:53,466 --> 00:24:56,467
Why is the CIA running
a fake war in Afghanistan?

602
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:58,448
They're doing
everything they can.

603
00:24:58,522 --> 00:25:00,310
They're doing it badly.

604
00:25:00,507 --> 00:25:02,808
The CIA is arming
the mujahideen.

605
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:04,020
Where do you think
they're getting
their weapons?

606
00:25:04,091 --> 00:25:07,288
They're arming them
with 12.7 millimeter
Dishukas

607
00:25:07,356 --> 00:25:08,915
which would be good,

608
00:25:08,986 --> 00:25:12,020
except the Soviets have
specifically armor-plated
their Hind helicopter

609
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:14,873
to resist
a 12.7 millimeter shell.

610
00:25:15,227 --> 00:25:17,049
We sold Pakistan F-16s,

611
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:20,661
but didn't give them
the look-downlshoot-down
radar.

612
00:25:20,731 --> 00:25:21,746
If this were a real war,

613
00:25:21,819 --> 00:25:24,121
State would issue
a white paper outlining
the Communist threat

614
00:25:24,188 --> 00:25:26,293
the way they did
in El Salvador.

615
00:25:26,363 --> 00:25:30,039
If this were a real war,
there'd be a National
Bipartisan Commission

616
00:25:30,106 --> 00:25:34,547
on Afghanistan, headed
by Henry Kissinger the way
they did in Central America.

617
00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:38,645
If this were a real war,
Congress would authorize
$24 million

618
00:25:38,715 --> 00:25:41,847
for covert operations
the way you did in Nicaragua.

619
00:25:42,204 --> 00:25:44,146
If this were a real war...

620
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:47,127
You may be
the sexiest woman ever.

621
00:25:47,194 --> 00:25:49,463
I'm not kidding.
You are Helen of Troy.

622
00:25:49,531 --> 00:25:50,741
Are you patronizing me?

623
00:25:50,811 --> 00:25:53,113
What do you want me
to do, Joanne?

624
00:25:53,275 --> 00:25:55,184
This is what
I want you to do.

625
00:25:55,259 --> 00:25:58,259
I want you to save Afghanistan
for the Afghans.

626
00:25:58,651 --> 00:26:00,625
I want you to deliver
such a crushing defeat

627
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,356
to the Soviets
that Communism crumbles,

628
00:26:02,426 --> 00:26:04,696
and in so doing,
end the Cold War.

629
00:26:04,762 --> 00:26:05,809
L'll tell you,
I'd do it, too,

630
00:26:05,882 --> 00:26:08,272
but I got this
Dairy Queen problem
in Nacogdoches.

631
00:26:08,347 --> 00:26:12,177
Don't underestimate me,
Charlie. Believe everything
you've heard.

632
00:26:12,923 --> 00:26:14,582
What exactly
do you want me to do?

633
00:26:14,652 --> 00:26:16,026
Go to Pakistan
and meet with Zia.

634
00:26:16,091 --> 00:26:17,237
CHARLIE: Zia?

635
00:26:17,692 --> 00:26:19,384
Mohammed Zia ul-Haq.

636
00:26:19,804 --> 00:26:21,395
He's the President
of Pakistan.

637
00:26:21,466 --> 00:26:22,928
I've already arranged it.

638
00:26:23,002 --> 00:26:25,817
You've arranged a meeting
between me and the
President of Pakistan?

639
00:26:25,882 --> 00:26:26,831
Yes.

640
00:26:26,906 --> 00:26:28,020
You're going
to Israel next week

641
00:26:28,091 --> 00:26:29,848
to meet with Zvi Rafiah
about the Lavi jets.

642
00:26:29,916 --> 00:26:32,730
I want you to tack Pakistan
on the end of your trip.

643
00:26:32,796 --> 00:26:33,941
And meet
with the President?

644
00:26:34,012 --> 00:26:37,046
Let him convince you
that it's a Christian
imperative

645
00:26:37,116 --> 00:26:40,180
to let the Afghans
rid their country
of Communism.

646
00:26:40,923 --> 00:26:44,600
Okay. It's not likely
the President of Pakistan
is a Christian,

647
00:26:44,667 --> 00:26:47,221
but I'm gonna do this
for you, Joanne,

648
00:26:47,292 --> 00:26:49,910
'Cause you saved my ass
once with the pro-lifers

649
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:54,039
and I owe you my seat
in Congress and because
you look very good naked.

650
00:26:54,108 --> 00:26:57,969
But I have to tell you,
I'm elected by Jews.

651
00:26:58,043 --> 00:27:00,410
How many Jews do you have
in your district?

652
00:27:00,476 --> 00:27:01,458
Seven.

653
00:27:01,532 --> 00:27:03,506
But congressmen aren't
elected by voters,

654
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,888
they're elected
by contributors,

655
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:07,826
and mine are in,
well, New York,
Florida, Hollywood,

656
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,290
because I'm one
of Israel's guys
on the Hill.

657
00:27:10,365 --> 00:27:11,542
And I don't know
how they're gonna feel

658
00:27:11,613 --> 00:27:13,978
about me taking up
the cause of Muslims.

659
00:27:14,043 --> 00:27:15,320
Well, that's
your problem.

660
00:27:15,388 --> 00:27:16,632
Yes, it is.

661
00:27:17,308 --> 00:27:18,770
Go fight this war
and win it, Charlie.

662
00:27:18,844 --> 00:27:22,139
Everything possible is
on the line, including
your manhood.

663
00:27:22,204 --> 00:27:24,888
Oh, I was afraid you
were gonna say that.

664
00:27:25,117 --> 00:27:26,065
(WATER RUSHING)

665
00:27:27,421 --> 00:27:29,843
Well, I guess it ain't
gonna be twice tonight.

666
00:27:29,917 --> 00:27:32,337
Well, I guess
somebody can't count.

667
00:27:32,412 --> 00:27:34,834
Oh, darling,
I was talking about me.

668
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,021
(SPEAKING URDU)

669
00:28:38,557 --> 00:28:39,507

(OFFICER SHOUTING)

671
00:28:41,534 --> 00:28:42,939
Congressman Charlie Wilson.

672
00:28:43,004 --> 00:28:43,952
Mr. Congressman.

673
00:28:44,028 --> 00:28:45,621
(CHUCKLING)
Mr. President.

674
00:28:48,253 --> 00:28:49,333
Yeah.

675
00:28:49,917 --> 00:28:51,739
Joanne Herring speaks
very highly of you.

676
00:28:51,804 --> 00:28:54,193
Oh, well, thank you, sir.
Thank you.

677
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,993
These are two
of my brightest advisors

678
00:28:56,062 --> 00:28:58,877
when it comes
to the problem
of the Soviets.

679
00:28:59,485 --> 00:29:01,109
This is Brigadier Rashid.

680
00:29:02,076 --> 00:29:03,091
How do you do?
Pleased to meet you.

681
00:29:03,165 --> 00:29:04,474
Colonel Mahmood.
How do you do?

682
00:29:04,541 --> 00:29:05,970
Pleased to meet you.

683
00:29:06,045 --> 00:29:06,994
Please come.

684
00:29:07,068 --> 00:29:08,181
Thank you.

685
00:29:11,358 --> 00:29:13,246
You must be thirsty.
Can we get you a drink?

686
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:16,954
Oh, actually I'd love
a glass of ice and
any kind of whiskey.

687
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:18,546
Rye, Canadian.

688
00:29:19,612 --> 00:29:20,562
Uh...

689
00:29:22,366 --> 00:29:24,405
I'm sorry, Congressman,
we don't have alcohol

690
00:29:24,477 --> 00:29:26,616
in the Presidential Residence.

691
00:29:27,197 --> 00:29:30,328
Of course, you don't.
I apologize.

692
00:29:32,285 --> 00:29:33,397
Fruit juice?

693
00:29:33,469 --> 00:29:34,746
(SPEAKING URDU)

694
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:37,203
Bet a lot of people
make that mistake.

695
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:38,225
(LAUGHING)

696
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,602
No.

697
00:29:40,253 --> 00:29:41,202
Okay.

698
00:29:41,276 --> 00:29:42,291
Brigadier?

699
00:29:42,973 --> 00:29:45,973
So you understand
the situation on
our border?

700
00:29:46,622 --> 00:29:49,753
Yes, sir, I think I do.
And I think it's terrible.

701
00:29:50,302 --> 00:29:53,433
And I know I speak for
all the people in the Texas
Second Congressional District

702
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:55,922
when I say our thoughts
and our prayers
are with you.

703
00:29:55,996 --> 00:29:58,385
All the people
of the Texas Second
Congressional District,

704
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,769
you say?
Yes, indeed, sir.

705
00:29:59,837 --> 00:30:03,699
Three million Afghan refugees
are living like poorly
treated livestock.

706
00:30:03,773 --> 00:30:05,464
Another two million
have fled into Iran.

707
00:30:05,533 --> 00:30:06,940
And two million
more angry men

708
00:30:07,006 --> 00:30:08,948
is just what the doctors
ordered for Iran,
don't you think?

709
00:30:09,022 --> 00:30:11,478
People are dying
by the tens of thousands.

710
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:14,483
And the ones that aren't
are crossing into Pakistan
every day.

711
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:15,965
MAHMOOD: Would you like
to know how many?

712
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,786
One fifth of Afghanistan
now lives

713
00:30:17,853 --> 00:30:20,340
in Pakistan's
North-West Frontier Province.

714
00:30:20,414 --> 00:30:22,302
ZIA: So, what I have
been wondering is

715
00:30:22,366 --> 00:30:25,400
why your State Department
would send someone here

716
00:30:25,471 --> 00:30:27,610
who thinks
he understands
the problem.

717
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,026
'Cause I don't think
the prayers of the Texas
Second Congressional District

718
00:30:31,101 --> 00:30:32,377
are going to turn
the trick.

719
00:30:32,446 --> 00:30:35,348
Well, now, I wasn't sent here
by the State Department,
Mr. President.

720
00:30:35,422 --> 00:30:37,332
I was asked to come here
by our friend in Houston.

721
00:30:37,406 --> 00:30:39,510
So this is
a courtesy call.

722
00:30:39,582 --> 00:30:43,292
I don't need courtesy.
I need airplanes,
guns and money.

723
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:47,864
Well, we just doubled
the CIA budget
for covert ops...

724
00:30:47,933 --> 00:30:49,307
From 5 million
to 10 million.

725
00:30:49,374 --> 00:30:51,284
That's right.
Is that a joke?

726
00:30:52,574 --> 00:30:54,581
No.
Is that meant
to be a funny joke?

727
00:30:54,654 --> 00:30:55,602
No, sir.

728
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,403
ZIA: Congressman,
what they're saying is

729
00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:00,984
$10 million from the U.S.
To fight the Russian Army

730
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,539
is such a low figure
that it can be mistaken
for a joke.

731
00:31:04,608 --> 00:31:08,184
I caught up to the
sarcasm there, sir.
Let me be clear.

732
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:11,222
The United States is
eager to assist you.

733
00:31:11,295 --> 00:31:12,309
No, you're not.
You're not.

734
00:31:12,382 --> 00:31:14,008
Absolutely not.
I went to Oxford

735
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:15,322
and I know what
that word means.

736
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:17,529
The U.S. Is not eager
to assist us.

737
00:31:17,598 --> 00:31:20,348
Well, now it's
my understanding that we
offered to sell you F-16s.

738
00:31:20,414 --> 00:31:21,363
You didn't want them.

739
00:31:21,438 --> 00:31:23,032
Because you refused
to sell us the radar.

740
00:31:23,103 --> 00:31:24,311
RASHID: So to hell with that.

741
00:31:24,381 --> 00:31:27,578
ZIA: And this is emblematic
of American fence sitting

742
00:31:27,645 --> 00:31:29,075
when it comes
to fighting the Soviets.

743
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:31,964
To hell with it!
You sell us the planes
but not the radar.

744
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:35,064
You offer Afghans rifles
from the First World War

745
00:31:35,455 --> 00:31:38,619
while Soviet helicopters
are killing everything
they can find,

746
00:31:38,687 --> 00:31:41,207
people, animals,
food supplies.
So to hell with it!

747
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:43,449
Yeah.
You sell
the Israelis the radar,

748
00:31:43,518 --> 00:31:45,427
so that's why he says,
"To hell with it."

749
00:31:45,502 --> 00:31:47,542
Again, I understood. Yeah.

750
00:31:47,741 --> 00:31:51,038
Also, the arms and funding
should flow through us.

751
00:31:53,023 --> 00:31:54,005
I'm sorry?

752
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,737
That's been part
of the problem.

753
00:31:55,807 --> 00:31:58,229
The arms and the funding
should flow through us.

754
00:31:58,303 --> 00:32:00,822
We have experience
with warfare of this kind.

755
00:32:00,894 --> 00:32:03,709
And your CIA has
an unimpressive
track record.

756
00:32:03,774 --> 00:32:05,847
Oh. I wouldn't say that.

757
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,661
They missed 130,000
Soviet soldiers walking
into Afghanistan.

758
00:32:10,655 --> 00:32:12,216
Okay, we blew that call.

759
00:32:12,287 --> 00:32:13,750
I would say so.

760
00:32:17,406 --> 00:32:23,386
Well, I don't want
to use up any more

00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:40,279
I learned about you
before you came here.

00:32:40,351 --> 00:32:43,515
I learned that you're a man
of many character flaws.

that you never
promise anything

No, I don't,

Well, there were

Because last year

You know, I had a neighbor,
growing up, with a name
right out of Dickens.

871
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,131
Mr. Charles Hazard.

872
00:40:04,451 --> 00:40:07,485
And Mr. Hazard didn't like
the neighborhood dogs

873
00:40:07,555 --> 00:40:09,563
messing up his flower beds.

874
00:40:10,083 --> 00:40:11,872
One day, I heard
a bunch of yelling
from across the street,

875
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,314
so I ran on over
to Mr. Hazard's,

876
00:40:13,379 --> 00:40:16,991
and there were about
15 grown-ups standing
around my dog, Teddy,

877
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:20,800
who was writhing
on the ground
in obvious agony.

878
00:40:21,314 --> 00:40:23,103
Blood was pouring
out of his mouth.

879
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:25,407
Mr. Hazard had
ground up a glass bottle

880
00:40:25,476 --> 00:40:28,608
and put it in a bowl
of dog food and
fed it to him.

881
00:40:30,243 --> 00:40:31,771
What did you do?

882
00:40:32,292 --> 00:40:35,259
Well, I got some gasoline
and burned down
his flower beds.

883
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:37,666
But that wasn't
satisfying enough.

884
00:40:38,755 --> 00:40:42,236
And then I remembered,
Mr. Hazard was
an elected official.

885
00:40:42,307 --> 00:40:44,544
He was the head
of the town council.

886
00:40:44,611 --> 00:40:47,395
His reelection every two years
was a foregone conclusion.

887
00:40:47,461 --> 00:40:51,716
So come Election Day,
I drove over to
the black section of town.

888
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,943
Now, these people
hadn't voted in any of
these elections, so...

889
00:40:55,011 --> 00:40:57,793
I was only 13,
but I had a farmer's license

890
00:40:59,267 --> 00:41:00,696
and I filled up my car
with black voters

891
00:41:00,772 --> 00:41:01,982
and drove them
to the polling place

892
00:41:02,052 --> 00:41:03,328
and then waited,
then drove them on home.

893
00:41:03,395 --> 00:41:06,211
But before they got out
of the car to vote

894
00:41:06,276 --> 00:41:11,198
I said, " I don't
mean to influence you,
but I think you should know

895
00:41:11,269 --> 00:41:14,715

has intentionally
killed my dog."

896
00:41:17,027 --> 00:41:19,614
About 400 ballots were
cast in that election.

897
00:41:19,684 --> 00:41:22,173
I drove 96 of them
to the polls.

898
00:41:23,237 --> 00:41:25,244
Hazard lost by 16 votes.

899
00:41:28,677 --> 00:41:32,025

00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:13,021
which are running
a little more than
we thought.

915
00:42:13,093 --> 00:42:14,718
The mules?
They're 2,400 a piece,

916
00:42:14,788 --> 00:42:16,676
plus we got to get them
checked out.
For what?

917
00:42:16,741 --> 00:42:19,873
Diseases. Foot and mouth.
Plus they have to have
their ears cleaned.

918
00:42:19,941 --> 00:42:22,210
The mules are getting
better health care
than the Afghans.

919
00:42:22,277 --> 00:42:25,439
AGENT WELLS: Plus, they're
gonna cost a little extra
if we want them pre-trained.

920
00:42:25,507 --> 00:42:26,970
To do what?
Walk over a mountain

921
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,124
with ammunition
on their back.

922
00:42:28,197 --> 00:42:29,473
Aren't they born
with that instinct?

923
00:42:29,541 --> 00:42:32,126
I mean, isn't that
something they want
to do naturally?

924
00:42:32,197 --> 00:42:35,296
You think Afghanistan might,
one day, think about building
some fucking roads?

925
00:42:35,366 --> 00:42:37,056
Gust.
Yeah?

926
00:42:37,126 --> 00:42:39,013
I got something for you.

927
00:42:39,942 --> 00:42:41,283
I need you
to be specific...

928
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,715
MARLA: The whole thing
has changed. Get your diary.
L'll show you.

929
00:42:43,779 --> 00:42:44,827
Okay.

930
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,876
RECEPTIONIST: No problem.
Thank you.

931
00:42:49,349 --> 00:42:50,461
He should be here
any moment.

932
00:42:50,534 --> 00:42:53,086
Don't worry about me.
I'm fine.

933
00:42:54,535 --> 00:42:56,192
Good morning.
Good morning, Congressman.

934
00:42:56,261 --> 00:42:57,822
Welcome back.
Yeah. Marla.

935
00:42:57,894 --> 00:42:59,268
Welcome back.
Suzanne.

936
00:42:59,334 --> 00:43:00,739
Welcome back.

937
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:03,003
Who are you?

938
00:43:03,078 --> 00:43:04,222
RECEPTIONIST:
This is Gust Avrakotos.

939
00:43:04,292 --> 00:43:05,983
He's come up from Langley
to bring you the information

940
00:43:06,053 --> 00:43:07,964
that you wanted.
Bonnie!

941
00:43:08,454 --> 00:43:09,402
Yes, sir?

942
00:43:09,478 --> 00:43:11,004
I said Assistant Deputy
Director or higher.

943
00:43:11,078 --> 00:43:12,900
I know, sir. I called...
No, Assistant Deputies
don't come

944
00:43:12,966 --> 00:43:14,013
to the Hill
without a subpoena.

945
00:43:14,086 --> 00:43:16,672
I'm the guy you want
to talk to, Congressman.
I'm on the Afghan desk.

946
00:43:16,742 --> 00:43:18,563
You're on
the Afghan desk?
Yeah.

947
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:21,117
Well, I wouldn't be
too proud of that. I just
got back from there.

948
00:43:21,189 --> 00:43:23,426
Oh, I know.
And that's a hell
of a flight, too.

949
00:43:23,493 --> 00:43:25,249
That nine hours flying time
against the jet stream.

950
00:43:25,318 --> 00:43:27,357
Probably had to stop
in Brussels, plus the
time difference.

951
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:28,707
I'd be a little grumpy
myself.

952
00:43:28,774 --> 00:43:30,302
I ain't grumpy
because of the plane.

953
00:43:31,398 --> 00:43:34,399
We want to give you this
'Cause we know you
like single malt.

954
00:43:34,471 --> 00:43:35,876
It's called Talisker,

955
00:43:35,941 --> 00:43:37,851
and it's mentioned in a
Robert Louis Stevenson poem,

956
00:43:37,926 --> 00:43:39,682
The Scotsman's Return
from Abroad.

957
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:41,539
"The king o' drinks,
as I conceive it,

958
00:43:41,606 --> 00:43:43,995
"Talisker, Isla
or Glenlivet!"

959
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:46,458
Who are you again?
Gust Avrakotos.

960
00:43:47,782 --> 00:43:49,156
Have Bonnie come
into this meeting.

961
00:43:49,222 --> 00:43:50,716
MARLA: Yes, sir.

962
00:43:51,494 --> 00:43:53,054
What's the gift for?

963
00:43:53,126 --> 00:43:55,874
It's from the Afghan desk
for doubling the budget
for the mujahideen.

964
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:58,559
Oh. Well, thank you.

965
00:43:59,173 --> 00:44:00,635
It was nothing.

966
00:44:00,901 --> 00:44:03,291
Well, it's a nice
bottle of Scotch.

967
00:44:04,069 --> 00:44:05,052
Must've been hard to get.

968
00:44:05,127 --> 00:44:06,818
No, doubling
the budget was nothing.

969
00:44:06,887 --> 00:44:09,789
I mean, $10 million
for covert ops against the
Russian Army is meaningless.

970
00:44:09,862 --> 00:44:12,250
What are you, an infant?
Now, you hang
on just one second.

971
00:44:12,325 --> 00:44:13,274
I don't remember your name.

972
00:44:13,349 --> 00:44:14,626
Gust Avrakotos.

973
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:15,641
Gust Avrakotos.

974
00:44:15,717 --> 00:44:16,667
Yeah.

975
00:44:16,742 --> 00:44:18,367
Okay, you mind
if I call you Gus?

976
00:44:18,438 --> 00:44:20,773
Yeah, well, my name's Gust
with a "t," but I don't care.

977
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:26,055
Fifteen hours ago, I offered
Harold Holt the keys
to the safe, okay?

978
00:44:26,854 --> 00:44:30,911
I stood there in the office
in Islamabad, and I said,
"How much do you need?"

979
00:44:30,982 --> 00:44:32,443
And I was apparently
annoying him.

980
00:44:32,517 --> 00:44:35,168
Well, Harold Holt's
a massive tool, Congressman.
He's a cake-eater.

981
00:44:35,238 --> 00:44:36,864
He's a clown.
He's a bad station chief.

982
00:44:36,934 --> 00:44:39,870
And I don't mean to cast
aspersions on a guy, but
he's gonna get us all killed.

983
00:44:39,942 --> 00:44:41,055
Really?
Yeah.

984
00:44:41,126 --> 00:44:43,910
Well, how does he expect
to defeat the Soviets in
Afghanistan without...

985
00:44:43,976 --> 00:44:45,950
He said, " A sudden
influx of money..."
Yeah, an influx of money

986
00:44:46,023 --> 00:44:47,330
and new weaponry
would draw attention.

987
00:44:47,397 --> 00:44:49,765
He's not trying to defeat
the Soviets, Congressman.

988
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:50,877
What the hell
are you talking about?

989
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:51,899
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

990
00:44:52,838 --> 00:44:54,114
Excuse me.

991
00:44:55,206 --> 00:44:56,832
I'm the Congressman's
aide, Bonnie Bach.

992
00:44:56,903 --> 00:44:58,048
Gust Avrakotos.

993
00:44:58,119 --> 00:44:59,712
Gus, I need the room
for a second.

994
00:44:59,783 --> 00:45:01,409
Sure.
Jailbait!

995
00:45:04,998 --> 00:45:07,486
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey.
Whoa, all right.

996
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:08,703
Just tell me
what's happening.

997
00:45:08,774 --> 00:45:10,913
A Justice Department
task force that was
formed last year

998
00:45:10,982 --> 00:45:13,088
to investigate
reports of sex between
members of the House

999
00:45:13,159 --> 00:45:15,014
and their male interns
has recently widened

1000
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:16,802
to include the use
of recreational drugs

1001
00:45:16,871 --> 00:45:18,727
by senators and congressmen.

1002
00:45:18,792 --> 00:45:20,002
Do you know a man
named Paul Brown?

1003
00:45:20,072 --> 00:45:21,217
BONNIE: He doesn't
have to answer that.
Keep going.

1004
00:45:21,287 --> 00:45:22,237
Oh, shit.

1005
00:45:22,312 --> 00:45:25,889
Paul Brown, under
investigation by federal
prosecutors for fraud.

1006
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:29,414
He wanted me to invest
in some TV show for Crystal.

1007
00:45:29,479 --> 00:45:31,748
Well, he's saying
he witnessed you
doing cocaine nine times

1008
00:45:31,815 --> 00:45:33,702
in a fantasy suite
in Las Vegas.

1009
00:45:33,766 --> 00:45:36,352
Brian Ross at NBC is
breaking the story.

1010
00:45:36,486 --> 00:45:40,283
All right, guys. I was
in Las Vegas with Crystal
and Paul Brown,

1011
00:45:40,358 --> 00:45:42,562
because she wanted me
to talk to him about
this thing.

1012
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:44,223
There was cocaine?

1013
00:45:45,286 --> 00:45:47,261
I want you to go
in the other room
and start on a statement.

1014
00:45:47,335 --> 00:45:48,796
Let's get Stu on the phone.
Okay, l'll call him.

1015

BONNIE: Okay, Bait,
you just need to start...

1016
00:45:49,959 --> 00:45:50,908
CHARLIE: It's all right,
everybody.

1017
00:45:50,983 --> 00:45:52,444
It's gonna be all right.
I want to get back to...

1018

(CLEARS THROAT)

No.

1022
00:45:58,598 --> 00:46:01,087
What do you mean,
he's not trying to
defeat the Soviets?

1023
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:03,678
Well, he wants to bleed them.
Payback for Vietnam.

1024
00:46:03,751 --> 00:46:05,213
Make it so they just have
to keep sending troops in,

1025
00:46:05,286 --> 00:46:06,531
keep sending money,
and troops, and money

1026
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:08,421
until they just go out
of their fucking minds
the way we did.

1027
00:46:08,487 --> 00:46:11,041
You mean to tell me
that the U.S. Strategy
in Afghanistan

1028
00:46:11,111 --> 00:46:13,021
is to have the Afghans
keep walking into
machine gun fire

1029
00:46:13,095 --> 00:46:14,209
till the Russians
run out of bullets?

1030
00:46:14,279 --> 00:46:15,326
That's Harold Holt's
strategy.

1031
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,221
It's not U.S. Strategy.
What is U.S. Strategy?

1032
00:46:17,287 --> 00:46:18,661
Well, strictly speaking,
we don't have one.

1033
00:46:18,726 --> 00:46:19,773
But we're working
hard on that.

1034
00:46:19,847 --> 00:46:21,254

Me and three other guys.

the helicopters.

1063
00:47:24,936 --> 00:47:27,391
If we can help them shoot down
the goddamn helicopters,

1064
00:47:27,462 --> 00:47:28,772
everything's gonna
start going our way.

1065
00:47:28,839 --> 00:47:32,135
You know, there's
a story about a Zen master
and a little boy.

1066
00:47:32,199 --> 00:47:34,022
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
All right, and... Yeah.

1067
00:47:37,128 --> 00:47:38,110
It's Stu.

1068
00:47:38,184 --> 00:47:39,613
You should be on this.

1069
00:47:41,513 --> 00:47:42,527
Stu?

1070
00:47:43,016 --> 00:47:44,839
No. No,
it's gonna be fine.

1071
00:47:44,905 --> 00:47:46,790
It was a party in Vegas.

1072
00:47:47,142 --> 00:47:48,965
Lot of drugs,
lot of people
I don't know.

1073
00:47:49,031 --> 00:47:52,196
I was there with Crystal Lee
and this guy Paul Brown

1074
00:47:52,264 --> 00:47:55,297
who wanted me to invest
in a TV show for Crystal.

1075
00:47:55,753 --> 00:47:56,735
I don't know.

1076
00:47:56,808 --> 00:47:59,710
I don't know, it's
gonna be like a Dallas
set in Washington.

1077
00:47:59,785 --> 00:48:01,857
What... Stu,
what does it matter?

1078
00:48:01,929 --> 00:48:02,976
Okay.

1079
00:48:03,591 --> 00:48:04,638
Okay.

1080
00:48:05,192 --> 00:48:07,330
Will Crystal back up
your story that you
weren't using?

1081
00:48:07,401 --> 00:48:09,605
Just go put out
the statement.

1082
00:48:09,768 --> 00:48:11,197
You know what?

1083
00:48:11,496 --> 00:48:14,911
You never should have been
in the same room, Congressman.

1084
00:48:14,985 --> 00:48:15,933
(DOOR SLAMS)

1085
00:48:17,289 --> 00:48:18,304
Gus!

1086
00:48:19,562 --> 00:48:22,876
Yeah.
The Swiss make
an antiaircraft gun

1087
00:48:22,952 --> 00:48:24,675
called the Oerlikon.
Listen, Charlie.

1088
00:48:24,743 --> 00:48:26,304
Twenty-millimeter cannon,
high rate of fire.

1089
00:48:26,376 --> 00:48:27,904
I know the Oerlikon.

1090
00:48:27,976 --> 00:48:29,799
Don't forget
the limo driver.

1091
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:30,879
What do you mean?

1092
00:48:30,952 --> 00:48:33,636
Well, you took a limo
from the casino to
the airport.

1093
00:48:33,706 --> 00:48:36,291
Maybe it's easy enough
to track down a limo driver,
hand him a subpoena,

1094
00:48:36,362 --> 00:48:37,922
ask him if anything
was going on in
the back seat,

1095
00:48:37,994 --> 00:48:39,901
so, you know,
in terms of cleaning
up this...

1096
00:48:39,977 --> 00:48:41,406
Were you listening
at the door?

1097
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,237
I wasn't listening
at the door.
Were you standing

1098
00:48:43,304 --> 00:48:45,345
at the goddamn door
listening to me?
No.

1099
00:48:45,417 --> 00:48:47,751
How could you even...
That's a thick door!

1100
00:48:47,817 --> 00:48:49,541
You stood there
and you listened to me?

1101
00:48:49,609 --> 00:48:50,886
I wasn't standing at the door.
Don't be an idiot.

1102
00:48:50,954 --> 00:48:52,198
I bugged the Scotch bottle.

1103
00:48:52,266 --> 00:48:53,280
What?

1104
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:55,330
Yeah, it's got a little
transmitter on it.

1105
00:48:55,402 --> 00:48:58,150
I got a little thing
in my ear. Get past it.

1106
00:48:58,216 --> 00:49:01,414
I don't believe this. Who the
fuck... Who the fuck are you?

1107
00:49:01,481 --> 00:49:03,140
It's not in my ear right now.
Take it easy.

1108
00:49:03,209 --> 00:49:05,510
I was gonna tell you about it,
but I had to leave the room
for a second

1109
00:49:05,576 --> 00:49:07,518
'Cause you were getting
indicted.
I ain't getting indicted.

1110
00:49:07,593 --> 00:49:09,895
Is there a camera in here?
No, that's a little paranoid.

1111
00:49:09,961 --> 00:49:11,073
That's right.

1112
00:49:11,145 --> 00:49:14,080
Will you take the bug
off my Scotch bottle now?

1113
00:49:14,441 --> 00:49:15,487
Sure.

1114
00:49:18,089 --> 00:49:21,123
I saw two kids,
had their hands blown off

1115
00:49:21,513 --> 00:49:23,171
when they tried to pick
up something shiny.

1116
00:49:23,242 --> 00:49:26,111
Sometimes the kids think
those bombs are toys.

1117
00:49:26,217 --> 00:49:28,421
For children to pick up.
Yeah.

1118
00:49:28,969 --> 00:49:30,431
They're raping the women
and...
Yeah.

1119
00:49:30,506 --> 00:49:33,571
...bayoneting the pregnant
ones.
It's as bad as it can be.

1120
00:49:33,641 --> 00:49:36,609
But they still want to go out
and fight the Red Army.

1121
00:49:36,681 --> 00:49:38,656
Each and every one of them.
I've never seen anything
like that.

1122
00:49:38,728 --> 00:49:40,256
No, me, neither.

1123
00:49:40,841 --> 00:49:43,394
Let's be clear. I want to kill
Russians as much as you do.

1124
00:49:43,465 --> 00:49:46,400
Is the Oerlikon the right gun?
Is that what they should have?

1125
00:49:46,474 --> 00:49:48,132
Now, you know what?

1126
00:49:48,362 --> 00:49:49,344
You've had a long flight.

1127
00:49:49,418 --> 00:49:51,042
You're under a lot of stress.
You're under arrest.

1128
00:49:51,112 --> 00:49:52,574
I ain't under arrest.

1129
00:49:52,649 --> 00:49:54,176
Do you drink?
Oh, God, yeah.

1130
00:49:54,249 --> 00:49:55,710
Well, should we try
this Scotch,

1131
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:57,443
or is it gonna release
sarin gas when I open it?

1132
00:49:57,513 --> 00:50:00,328
Oh, I don't think so,
but open it over there.

1133
00:50:05,642 --> 00:50:08,030
How'd a guy like you get
into the Agency?

1134
00:50:08,105 --> 00:50:11,204
What, you mean a street guy?
You ain't James Bond.

1135
00:50:11,273 --> 00:50:14,569
And you ain't
Thomas Jefferson,
so let's call it even.

1136
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:15,809
Deal.

1137
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:18,912
Since there's no other reason
I should be here,

1138
00:50:18,985 --> 00:50:21,921
let's assume it's 'Cause
I'm very good at this.

1139
00:50:24,331 --> 00:50:26,697
They need to shoot down
the helicopters, Gus.

1140
00:50:26,761 --> 00:50:29,216
They need at least,
what, 50 Oerlikons.

1141
00:50:29,290 --> 00:50:31,177
Yeah, it's gonna cost
a lot more than $10 million.

1142
00:50:31,242 --> 00:50:33,064
And I say for the fourth time,
I can raise the money.

1143
00:50:33,129 --> 00:50:34,374
Yeah, how?

1144
00:50:34,442 --> 00:50:37,476
Is the Oerlikon the gun
I should be recommending?

1145
00:50:37,611 --> 00:50:38,985
I'm not sure.

1146
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:41,473
Who is sure?
A weapons guy named
Mike Vickers.

1147
00:50:41,547 --> 00:50:43,685
L'll call him.
Yeah. Let's call him
right now.

1148
00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:51,359
All right, here's a test.

1149
00:50:51,915 --> 00:50:53,507
You see the nerdy-looking kid
in the white shirt

1150
00:50:53,578 --> 00:50:55,552
playing against
the four guys at once?

1151
00:50:55,626 --> 00:50:56,575
CHARLIE: Yeah.

1152
00:50:56,746 --> 00:50:59,168
Which one of the guys do you
think is a strategic weapons
expert

1153
00:50:59,243 --> 00:51:01,283
with the CIA?

1154
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,208
(SIGHING)

1155
00:51:03,592 --> 00:51:04,738
That was a trick question,
Charlie.

1156
00:51:04,809 --> 00:51:07,176
It's the nerdy-looking kid
in the white shirt.

1157
00:51:07,242 --> 00:51:08,802
All right, no reason this
can't be fun, you know.

1158
00:51:08,873 --> 00:51:11,362
Mike!
Yeah, just a second.

1159
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:13,477
Need you now, Mike.

1160
00:51:17,419 --> 00:51:18,826
Keep playing.

1161
00:51:20,105 --> 00:51:22,178
Mike Vickers, this is
Congressman Charles Wilson

1162
00:51:22,249 --> 00:51:24,159
of the Defense Appropriations
Subcommittee.

1163
00:51:24,234 --> 00:51:26,623
How are you, sir?
Fine, thank you.

1164
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:30,313
How old are you?
L'll be 30 next week.

1165
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:32,681
This is the CIA's weapons
expert?

1166
00:51:32,779 --> 00:51:34,372
One of them.
But he's the most senior.

1167
00:51:34,444 --> 00:51:35,426
GUS: Look...
MAN: Mike!

1168
00:51:35,499 --> 00:51:37,701
Yeah, bishop to queen's
knight 7.

1169
00:51:37,769 --> 00:51:39,330
See? He's playing
without even looking
at the board.

1170
00:51:39,402 --> 00:51:40,482
That's a useful skill

1171
00:51:40,554 --> 00:51:43,457
if Afghanistan's ever invaded
by Boris Spassky.

1172
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:45,734
Did my office not make
it clear to Langley that
I'm in no mood

1173
00:51:45,802 --> 00:51:46,784
to be fucked around with?
Charlie...

1174
00:51:46,858 --> 00:51:48,931
You answer to me or
you answer to Jim Baker.
Which do you want?

1175
00:51:49,003 --> 00:51:51,753
All right, the guy's a fucking
Green Beret, Charlie.
He trained with the SEALs.

1176
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:54,241
No one's trying to fuck
with you!
MAN: Mike?

1177
00:51:54,316 --> 00:51:57,129
Yeah, what was your move?
Knight to queen's bishop 5.

1178
00:51:57,195 --> 00:51:58,721
All right, queen to king's
rook 3.

1179
00:51:58,794 --> 00:52:01,697
Guy on the right, you don't
want to trade queens with me.

1180
00:52:01,771 --> 00:52:02,818
Shit.

1181
00:52:03,147 --> 00:52:05,536
All right, I apologize.

1182
00:52:05,611 --> 00:52:07,521
Okay.
Everybody friends?

1183
00:52:07,627 --> 00:52:10,824
As a former naval officer
myself, Mike, I should've
known better.

1184
00:52:10,892 --> 00:52:12,835
As a former naval officer,
I'd have been surprised
if you had.

1185
00:52:12,908 --> 00:52:13,889
Now, what the fuck?
Hey.

1186
00:52:13,962 --> 00:52:15,751
He said he was sorry.
Hey.

1187
00:52:15,818 --> 00:52:17,247
What can I do for you, sir?

1188
00:52:17,323 --> 00:52:20,040
All right, he wants
to make a recommendation
to his Subcommittee.

1189
00:52:20,107 --> 00:52:22,976
Now, the Swiss made Oerlikon
S.T.A. Antiaircraft cannon,
that's what you'd use

1190
00:52:23,051 --> 00:52:25,441
to shoot down the Ml-24 Hind
gunship in the mountains,
right?

1191
00:52:25,516 --> 00:52:26,595
Well, the Oerlikon's
a good start,

1192
00:52:26,668 --> 00:52:28,839
but the Russians will
just start flying higher
altitude missions.

1193
00:52:28,909 --> 00:52:29,891
So what else do they need?

1194
00:52:29,964 --> 00:52:32,613
Same thing you give us.
AK-47 s, AK-74s, AKMS.

1195
00:52:32,682 --> 00:52:34,658
The Soviets didn't
come into Afghanistan
on a Eurail Pass.

1196
00:52:34,732 --> 00:52:36,160
They came in T-55 tanks.

1197
00:52:36,235 --> 00:52:38,854
The fighters need
RPG-7 anti-tank
grenade launchers,

1198
00:52:38,924 --> 00:52:43,146
Katyusha 107 mm rockets,
wire mines, plastic mines,
bicycle bombs, sniper rifles,

1199
00:52:43,211 --> 00:52:44,586
ammunition for
all the above

1200
00:52:44,651 --> 00:52:46,342
and frequency-hopping radios
and burst transmitters

1201
00:52:46,412 --> 00:52:48,930
so these guys aren't
so fucking easy to find.

1202
00:52:49,002 --> 00:52:50,889
Well, I've written it all
in a report you can read.

1203
00:52:50,954 --> 00:52:53,159
You'd be the first
one who did.

1204
00:52:54,282 --> 00:52:56,486
Send a copy of it to me
by secure courier right away.

1205
00:52:56,555 --> 00:52:58,694
I will. All right.
All right.

1206
00:53:01,004 --> 00:53:02,346
There was a report?

1207
00:53:02,412 --> 00:53:03,622
It's not that simple.

1208
00:53:04,268 --> 00:53:06,950
Why not?
Well, for one thing
it's covert.

1209
00:53:07,018 --> 00:53:08,580
When an Afghan freedom fighter
gets captured,

1210
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:10,025
it can't be with
an American-made
weapon on him.

1211
00:53:10,091 --> 00:53:11,913
That's how a cold war turns
into an actual war,

1212
00:53:11,978 --> 00:53:13,833
and that's something
you want to keep
a good eye on.

1213
00:53:13,898 --> 00:53:15,809
So anything we give them
has to look like

1214
00:53:15,883 --> 00:53:18,666
it could have plausibly
been captured from
the Soviets.

1215
00:53:18,732 --> 00:53:20,358
Yeah, that's right.
You know who's good at that?

1216
00:53:20,428 --> 00:53:22,664
Israel and Egypt.
That's right.

1217
00:53:24,205 --> 00:53:25,578
You know what Vickers
just described back there

1218
00:53:25,643 --> 00:53:27,977
could cost as much
as $40 million.

1219
00:53:28,236 --> 00:53:30,756
I can get the appropriation.
But how?

1220
00:53:31,691 --> 00:53:33,666
I want to know how are you
gonna get the approval
of Congress

1221
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:35,366
when they're saying no
to the Contras for nothing,

1222
00:53:35,436 --> 00:53:37,989
for $5 million, a request
made by the President?

1223
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:40,035
When a black approp makes it
through this Subcommittee,

1224
00:53:40,109 --> 00:53:42,247
the full body has
to vote on it blind.

1225
00:53:42,315 --> 00:53:44,388
They know the dollar amount,
but they don't know
what it's for.

1226
00:53:44,459 --> 00:53:48,322
So, theoretically, your
$10 million can become
40 million

1227
00:53:48,396 --> 00:53:50,338
without anyone ever noticing
but the Russian Army.

1228
00:53:50,412 --> 00:53:52,201
Because Congress
wouldn't know what
it was voting on.

1229
00:53:52,268 --> 00:53:53,283
That's the beauty of it!

1230
00:53:53,357 --> 00:53:55,048
All you need are the nine
other Subcommittee members.

1231
00:53:55,117 --> 00:53:56,578
All I really need is
the Committee Chairman.

1232
00:53:56,652 --> 00:53:58,343
Doc Long.
Doc Long.

1233
00:53:58,669 --> 00:54:01,634
And with Doc's backing,
you'll get the votes of
the other Committee members.

1234
00:54:01,707 --> 00:54:02,787
Yep.
I don't believe you.

1235
00:54:02,859 --> 00:54:03,841
I don't care.

1236
00:54:03,916 --> 00:54:05,126
And until the phone rang
this morning, Charlie,

1237
00:54:05,195 --> 00:54:07,367
I didn't know
I'd never heard of you.

1238
00:54:07,436 --> 00:54:08,997
Well, ask around.

1239
00:54:09,132 --> 00:54:11,172
I did.
And what'd you find out?

1240
00:54:11,245 --> 00:54:13,154
That your greatest legislative
achievement in six terms

1241
00:54:13,228 --> 00:54:14,636
was getting reelected
five times.

1242
00:54:14,701 --> 00:54:15,683
Anything else?

1243
00:54:15,757 --> 00:54:17,992
That you hold more IOUs
than any member of the House.

1244
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:19,042
(LAUGHING)

1245
00:54:19,116 --> 00:54:20,578
How about that?

1246
00:54:20,747 --> 00:54:24,228
I represent the only district
in America that doesn't
want anything.

1247
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:27,115
They want their guns,
they want low taxes,
that's it.

1248
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,864
I can do favors.
I get to vote yes a lot.

1249
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:35,046
Now, me and three other guys
are killing Russians.

1250
00:54:35,116 --> 00:54:36,325
I mean, is it possible

1251
00:54:36,395 --> 00:54:40,039
that I've met the only elected
official in town who can help?

1252
00:54:41,835 --> 00:54:44,073
Give me a week
to set things up.

1253
00:54:44,172 --> 00:54:47,718
Go pack a bag.
I have a friend,
an arms dealer in Israel.

1254
00:54:48,173 --> 00:54:50,060
He's who we need for this,
God help us.

1255
00:54:50,125 --> 00:54:52,230
Should be interesting.
Yeah.

1256
00:54:53,101 --> 00:54:54,081
All right.

1257
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:56,769
CHARLIE: We need you, Zvi.

1258
00:54:56,843 --> 00:54:59,210
You're gonna be our man
inside the Israeli Parliament.

1259
00:54:59,276 --> 00:55:00,967
ZVl: I'm not in the Israeli
Parliament.

1260
00:55:01,037 --> 00:55:02,946
That's what's gonna
make you so effective.

1261
00:55:03,021 --> 00:55:05,225
No one has your pull
with the 10th Knesset.

1262
00:55:05,293 --> 00:55:07,301
No one has your relationship
with the Speaker.

1263
00:55:07,374 --> 00:55:09,513
And we are gonna...
We're gonna need your arm
around Menachem,

1264
00:55:09,582 --> 00:55:13,322
when he finds out that
we're working with
Egypt and the Saudis.

1265
00:55:13,708 --> 00:55:16,490
Tell him.
Tell him why we need him.

1266
00:55:16,972 --> 00:55:19,428
GUS: I'm not saying anything.
Why not?

1267
00:55:19,757 --> 00:55:22,278
I don't know who the fuck
these two other guys are.

1268
00:55:22,348 --> 00:55:24,356
Well, ain't they bodyguards?
Not ours.

1269
00:55:24,461 --> 00:55:25,475
Zvi?

1270
00:55:29,484 --> 00:55:32,037
Now, just to sum this
up in a nutshell.

1271
00:55:32,588 --> 00:55:35,077
You want me
to move Israel

1272
00:55:35,661 --> 00:55:40,102
toward a partnership
with Egypt, Pakistan
and Afghanistan.

1273
00:55:40,174 --> 00:55:41,735
And Saudi Arabia.

1274
00:55:43,342 --> 00:55:46,244
Well, just a couple of
problems I can foresee
off the top of my head.

1275
00:55:46,318 --> 00:55:47,298
Look.

1276
00:55:47,372 --> 00:55:48,355
Charlie...
I know.

1277
00:55:48,429 --> 00:55:52,423
...Pakistan and Afghanistan
don't recognize our right
to exist.

1278
00:55:52,493 --> 00:55:56,203
Calm down.
We just got done fighting
a war with Egypt

1279
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:59,466
and every person who has
ever tried to kill me
and my family,

1280
00:55:59,534 --> 00:56:01,476
has been trained
in Saudi Arabia.

1281
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:03,689
That's not entirely true, Zvi.

1282
00:56:03,983 --> 00:56:06,085
I mean, some of them
were trained by us.

1283
00:56:06,156 --> 00:56:07,564
CHARLIE: Gus, come on.

1284
00:56:08,589 --> 00:56:11,491
It's his sense of humor.
It's a bit of an
acquired taste.

1285
00:56:11,566 --> 00:56:13,508
Now, Zvi, look at me.

1286
00:56:14,028 --> 00:56:16,778
This is the front
of the Cold War.

1287
00:56:16,845 --> 00:56:19,693
It's not in Berlin,
it's not in Cuba,
it's not in Czechoslovakia.

1288
00:56:19,757 --> 00:56:22,212
It's in a pile of rocks
called Afghanistan.

1289
00:56:22,286 --> 00:56:24,772
These are the only people
who are actually shooting
at the Russians.

1290
00:56:24,843 --> 00:56:27,495
Now, you and I know we have
to get Soviet-made weapons

1291
00:56:27,564 --> 00:56:28,874
into the hands
of the mujahideen.

1292
00:56:28,941 --> 00:56:30,599
And you and I know
where the largest stockpile

1293
00:56:30,668 --> 00:56:33,452
of Soviet weapons
outside the Soviet Union is.

1294
00:56:33,518 --> 00:56:35,044
I can't tell you offhand
how many

1295
00:56:35,117 --> 00:56:37,256
and what kind of weapons
we've confiscated.

1296
00:56:37,325 --> 00:56:41,481
I can. These are Keyhole-11
satellite photos.

1297
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:45,188
They've been degraded
so I can show them to you.

1298
00:56:45,356 --> 00:56:46,982
All right, that's
a five-wheeled chassis tank.

1299
00:56:47,053 --> 00:56:49,509
That's not the Mk.1,
that's the T-55.

1300
00:56:49,582 --> 00:56:52,429
And it and four others are
about 12 miles from here.

1301
00:56:52,493 --> 00:56:54,665
What do you want tanks
in mountains for?

1302
00:56:54,734 --> 00:56:57,069
Oh, we don't. I just
wanted you to know I know
you got them.

1303
00:56:57,134 --> 00:57:00,394
$35.5 million.
Which you'll be able
to appropriate.

1304
00:57:00,588 --> 00:57:01,571
Yeah.

1305
00:57:01,645 --> 00:57:03,533
Without the press asking
questions about it.

1306
00:57:03,597 --> 00:57:04,579
GUS: You know,
there's good news there,

1307
00:57:04,654 --> 00:57:07,372
because the press is going
to be busy asking about
a weekend in Vegas

1308
00:57:07,438 --> 00:57:09,707
and his pending arrest
on charges of narcotics
possession.

1309
00:57:09,774 --> 00:57:12,677
Oh, Gus.
Shit, Charlie.

1310
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:14,725
It's nothing.
Is this true?

1311
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:16,805
No, for our purposes,
it doesn't really matter.

1312
00:57:16,877 --> 00:57:18,470
Thank you.
I was just explaining to him

1313
00:57:18,542 --> 00:57:20,581
that as long as the press
sees sex and drugs behind
the left hand,

1314
00:57:20,653 --> 00:57:22,279
you can park a battle carrier
behind the right hand

1315
00:57:22,349 --> 00:57:23,560
and no one's gonna
fucking notice.

1316
00:57:23,630 --> 00:57:24,709
What the hell happened?

1317
00:57:24,782 --> 00:57:26,571
It's not germane.
It's not germane
to these people

1318
00:57:26,638 --> 00:57:29,933
who are fighting and dying,
and being massacred
in their homes.

1319
00:57:29,998 --> 00:57:32,901
Now, for the love of Christ,
will you help us help them

1320
00:57:32,975 --> 00:57:34,795
shoot down these fucking
helicopters?

1321
00:57:37,678 --> 00:57:39,368
I love you, Charlie,

1322
00:57:40,238 --> 00:57:42,060
but you are a grown man

1323
00:57:42,350 --> 00:57:46,987
who still hasn't learned
to look both ways before
he crosses the fucking street!

1324
00:57:53,294 --> 00:57:54,636
Yes, I'm in.

1325
00:57:56,750 --> 00:57:59,784
But I don't like this guy.
I know how you feel.

1326
00:58:01,326 --> 00:58:04,141
ZVl: What happens now?
You come with us to Cairo.

1327
00:58:04,206 --> 00:58:06,411
This meeting's gonna
be run professional?
Oh, absolutely.

1328
00:58:06,478 --> 00:58:08,420
We'll be talking
to the Deputy Defense Minister

1329
00:58:08,495 --> 00:58:11,657
while his boss gets
a belly dance from a friend
of Charlie's.

1330
00:58:11,725 --> 00:58:13,700
What?
A good friend of mine
back in Texas

1331
00:58:13,773 --> 00:58:14,919
is a well-known
belly dancer.

1332
00:58:14,989 --> 00:58:18,438
It's always been her dream
to perform in Egypt,
so she's our way in.

1333
00:58:18,510 --> 00:58:22,253
While she's dancing for
the Defense Minster, we'll
be talking to the Deputy.

1334
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:24,555
Oh, my God.
No, she's supposed to be good.

1335
00:58:27,885 --> 00:58:31,082
(ARABIC MUSIC PLAYING)

1336
00:58:59,151 --> 00:59:01,835
That's an extraordinary
woman.
Oh, yeah.

1337
00:59:05,998 --> 00:59:08,486
That's not any belly dance
I'm familiar with.

1338
00:59:08,558 --> 00:59:11,722
That's why I wanted the
Defense Minister to see her.

1339
00:59:11,951 --> 00:59:15,400
This is your girlfriend?
Carol's a friend.
She's an old friend.

1340
00:59:15,471 --> 00:59:18,886
I understand her father
didn't allow dancing because
of the religion?

1341
00:59:18,959 --> 00:59:21,511
Yeah, that's correct.

1342
00:59:21,582 --> 00:59:22,989
And what religion is that?

1343
00:59:23,055 --> 00:59:24,843
You know, she's a Baptist.

1344
00:59:26,607 --> 00:59:31,016
As I was saying, the Russians
will learn, I'm quite
afraid the hard way,

1345
00:59:31,088 --> 00:59:33,476
to fear God's vengeance
upon those

1346
00:59:33,552 --> 00:59:37,098
who oppress his humble
servants who submit
to him in Islam.

1347
00:59:37,393 --> 00:59:40,075
Their skulls will hang
from the treetops.

1348
00:59:40,143 --> 00:59:43,624
You can do whatever you like
with their skulls, I suppose.

1349
00:59:43,791 --> 00:59:49,454
What has Gus here concerned is
a SA surface-to-air missiles
you all have.

1350
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:51,178
For some reason, he thinks
they were stored poorly.

1351
00:59:51,247 --> 00:59:53,636
No, no, no, the SA-7 s
were stored properly.

1352
00:59:53,712 --> 00:59:57,256
Excuse me. What about
the oppression of my people?

1353
00:59:57,326 --> 00:59:58,919
Oh, Zvi.
I beg your pardon?

1354
00:59:58,990 --> 01:00:00,397
Fellows, we have
to do this now.

1355
01:00:00,463 --> 01:00:04,805
I am about to arrange
for $35 million worth of guns

1356
01:00:04,879 --> 01:00:06,407
to be put into the hands
of Muslims!

1357
01:00:06,479 --> 01:00:09,676
I meant no disrespect.
Oh, really?

1358
01:00:09,743 --> 01:00:12,199
CHARLIE: Well, anyway, that...
None of this is important.

1359
01:00:12,272 --> 01:00:15,117
You have Soviet-licensed
factories that can put
out Kalashnikovs

1360
01:00:15,182 --> 01:00:17,038
at a rate of 25,000 a week?

1361
01:00:17,103 --> 01:00:20,070
That's correct.
What about city warfare
devices?

1362
01:00:20,143 --> 01:00:22,117
What kind?
Bicycle bombs, limpet mines,

1363
01:00:22,191 --> 01:00:23,402
plastic, tripwire mines?

1364
01:00:23,472 --> 01:00:25,512
Yes, yes. Whatever you need.

1365
01:00:27,761 --> 01:00:29,451
CHARLIE: We can't improve
the price now,

1366
01:00:29,521 --> 01:00:32,835
but when we come back
for more, we'll make
it up to you.

1367
01:00:32,942 --> 01:00:34,121
I agree.

1368
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:36,075
All right.

1369
01:00:46,128 --> 01:00:49,543
Hey, you did good back there
ignoring the religious shit.

1370
01:00:50,416 --> 01:00:52,270
'Cause these people are
totally fucking unspooled,

1371
01:00:52,335 --> 01:00:55,118
and I'm not just talking
about the Muslims.

1372
01:00:55,567 --> 01:00:57,956
Zvi's all right.
Oh, I know he is.

1373
01:00:58,256 --> 01:00:59,368
He is Mossad, by the way.

1374
01:00:59,441 --> 01:01:02,474
What I'm talking about is
your friend in Houston.

1375
01:01:02,737 --> 01:01:06,633
Now, she's got to stop
throwing fundraisers and
she's got to stop doing press.

1376
01:01:06,705 --> 01:01:09,158
Joanne is raising awareness.

1377
01:01:09,232 --> 01:01:10,541
(CHUCKLES)

1378
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:16,073
She's using
a non-secular vocabulary

1379
01:01:16,401 --> 01:01:18,822
and framing this
as a religious war.

1380
01:01:19,888 --> 01:01:22,060
And America doesn't
fight religious wars.

1381
01:01:22,130 --> 01:01:23,177
(SIGHING)

1382
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:25,617
Is that right?
Yeah, that's why
I like living there.

1383
01:01:25,681 --> 01:01:28,363
FLIGHT CAPTAIN. ; Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.
This is your captain.

1384
01:01:28,464 --> 01:01:30,188
We will begin our initial
descent

1385
01:01:30,257 --> 01:01:33,486
into Washington
Dulles Airport.
I got to go down
to Houston, so...

1386
01:01:33,553 --> 01:01:35,494
...I would like to thank you
and hope...

1387
01:01:35,569 --> 01:01:38,351
Well, talk to her.
Yeah, l'll talk to her.

1388
01:01:41,712 --> 01:01:44,080
You want me to go into
business with the Israelis?

1389
01:01:44,144 --> 01:01:46,347
Just for this one purpose,
yes, Mr. President.

1390
01:01:46,415 --> 01:01:50,759
The Israelis have the largest
stockpile of Soviet-made
weapons in friendly hands.

1391
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:52,174
I know that.

1392
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:56,176
I need to trust that
this arrangement
will remain secret.

1393
01:01:56,241 --> 01:02:00,365
Pakistan and Israel would
have to appear to be enemies
in the public eye.

1394
01:02:00,433 --> 01:02:02,799
Yeah, I don't think
that's a tough sell.

1395
01:02:02,863 --> 01:02:04,522
You have authority
to do this?

1396
01:02:04,592 --> 01:02:07,559
None whatsoever. In fact,
I'm pretty close to
violating the Logan Act.

1397
01:02:07,632 --> 01:02:09,420
Well, I don't know
what that is.

1398
01:02:09,488 --> 01:02:10,830
But, Charlie.
Yes, sir.

1399
01:02:10,897 --> 01:02:13,680
If I see one fucking
Star of David on a crate...

1400
01:02:13,745 --> 01:02:15,468
You won't. I promise.

1401
01:02:17,329 --> 01:02:18,344
Hey.
Excuse me.

1402
01:02:18,418 --> 01:02:21,067
You want me to take a look
at those remarks?

1403
01:02:21,136 --> 01:02:23,078
Why?
Just... Well,
your introduction,

1404
01:02:23,152 --> 01:02:27,310
want me to look it over?
It's an introduction, Charlie.
L'll be fine.

1405
01:02:34,801 --> 01:02:38,313
Today we honor President
Zia ul-Haq of Pakistan.

1406
01:02:38,832 --> 01:02:41,288
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

1407
01:02:51,411 --> 01:02:54,989
Before we go any further,
I would like you all
to know this,

1408
01:02:55,282 --> 01:02:57,614
President Zia did not
kill Bhutto.

1409
01:02:58,769 --> 01:03:00,395
In the time that
he's been President,

1410
01:03:00,465 --> 01:03:03,280
the fortunes of Pakistan
have changed radically.

1411
01:03:03,345 --> 01:03:04,523
I've asked you all here
today...

1412
01:03:05,906 --> 01:03:07,815
(CROWD CHATTERING)

1413
01:03:09,874 --> 01:03:12,046
(CUTLERY CLINKING)

1414
01:03:12,563 --> 01:03:14,568
You disappeared.

1415
01:03:14,769 --> 01:03:16,678
Well, they weren't
selling alcohol in there.

1416
01:03:16,753 --> 01:03:19,121
It's a traditional
Pakistani gathering.

1417
01:03:19,186 --> 01:03:20,910
You think they might be
a lot happier over there

1418
01:03:20,978 --> 01:03:24,207
if they could just get women
and booze in the same room
at the same time?

1419
01:03:24,273 --> 01:03:25,997
I think they'd be a whole
lot happier over there

1420
01:03:26,065 --> 01:03:27,472
if the Communists got out.

1421
01:03:27,538 --> 01:03:29,993
"Zia did not kill Bhutto."

1422
01:03:30,450 --> 01:03:33,764
That's not something you
usually hear in introductory
remarks.

1423
01:03:33,841 --> 01:03:37,157
He didn't, Charlie.
Bhutto had a trial
and was found guilty.

1424
01:03:37,233 --> 01:03:38,794
Shocking verdict.

1425
01:03:39,602 --> 01:03:42,089
What did you need
to talk to me about?

1426
01:03:42,930 --> 01:03:46,476
Joanne, darling,
dial down the religion.

1427
01:03:46,802 --> 01:03:49,039
What?
It could alienate people

1428
01:03:49,106 --> 01:03:50,763
whose support we need.

1429
01:03:50,833 --> 01:03:53,419
It's luncheons like this
that are raising the
money we need.

1430
01:03:53,489 --> 01:03:56,239
This thing is not gonna
get done by ballrooms
full of people

1431
01:03:56,305 --> 01:03:57,483
in the Houstonian Hotel.

1432
01:03:57,554 --> 01:04:00,783
It's gonna get done
by the CIA, Israel,
Egypt and Pakistan,

1433
01:04:00,849 --> 01:04:02,411
and it's gonna get
done quietly.

1434
01:04:02,482 --> 01:04:03,792
Now, you start making
people think

1435
01:04:03,859 --> 01:04:06,226
we're trying to convert
everybody to Christianity.

1436
01:04:06,291 --> 01:04:09,355
I was saved by Jesus Christ,
Charlie, and I am not
ashamed of it.

1437
01:04:09,425 --> 01:04:12,524
My fervor is not about
religion, it's about
freedom of religion,

1438
01:04:12,593 --> 01:04:13,609
which we have, they want,

1439
01:04:13,681 --> 01:04:15,853
and the Communists
are slaughtering them for.

1440
01:04:15,922 --> 01:04:19,086
And I get it.
Just tamp down the fervor.

1441
01:04:20,050 --> 01:04:22,832
Well, I can't modulate
God's will, sweetie.

1442
01:04:23,059 --> 01:04:24,401
You can try.

1443
01:04:25,265 --> 01:04:28,714
Now, I got to get back to D.C.
They've set up a briefing
for me at Langley.

1444
01:04:28,785 --> 01:04:31,055
On what?
On getting the guns.

1445
01:04:33,874 --> 01:04:35,303
Afghanistan's barely
a country.

1446
01:04:35,379 --> 01:04:37,550
There's no phones or roads
outside the cities.

1447
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:38,994
It's likely that a villager
would live his life

1448
01:04:39,059 --> 01:04:41,514
without having contact with
another village just three
miles down the road

1449
01:04:41,587 --> 01:04:43,560
unless he was going
to war against them.

1450
01:04:43,634 --> 01:04:46,155
Now, my thinking is instead
of 400,000 sloppy guys,

1451
01:04:46,226 --> 01:04:49,772
we concentrate on
several elite forces
totaling about 150,000.

1452
01:04:49,843 --> 01:04:51,272
Give these guys
real training,

1453
01:04:51,346 --> 01:04:54,162
20 different courses covering
irregular warfare disciplines.

1454
01:04:54,227 --> 01:04:55,689
GUS: And do you have anybody
in mind?

1455
01:04:55,763 --> 01:04:58,731
The most successful rebels
today are in the
Panjshir Valley.

1456
01:04:58,803 --> 01:05:01,190
They're called the
United Front of the
Council of the North.

1457
01:05:01,298 --> 01:05:03,240
We've earmarked them
for 10 million in weapons

1458
01:05:03,314 --> 01:05:05,802
and 10 to 15 agency advisors
for training.

1459
01:05:05,874 --> 01:05:08,809
CHARLIE: Who's their leader?
Ahmed Shah Massoud.

1460
01:05:08,883 --> 01:05:12,199
He's Tajik, so he's not well
liked by the Pashtun.

1461
01:05:12,274 --> 01:05:15,308
CHARLIE: So the... What,
the Tajiks have a problem
with the Pashtuns?

1462
01:05:15,378 --> 01:05:17,451
Well, they say when a Tajik
wants to make love to a woman,

1463
01:05:17,523 --> 01:05:20,205
his first choice is always
a Pashtun man.

1464
01:05:21,585 --> 01:05:23,974
It's funnier in
the original Pashto.

1465
01:05:24,242 --> 01:05:27,821
All right, I've heard enough.
I'm going to go get our money.

1466
01:05:28,051 --> 01:05:30,288
All right, don't fuck
us up now.

1467
01:05:31,123 --> 01:05:32,203
Awesome pep talk.

1468
01:05:32,275 --> 01:05:36,365
Afghanistan, Egypt, Pakistan
and Saudi Arabia,

1469
01:05:36,434 --> 01:05:39,117
these are all totalitarian
dictatorships.

1470
01:05:39,186 --> 01:05:43,442
And they'd like to blow the
only democracy in the region
right into the Mediterranean.

1471
01:05:43,507 --> 01:05:46,442
Now, you heard me say
that Israel's gonna
be on board.

1472
01:05:46,515 --> 01:05:49,101
Oh, well, Zvi Rafiah's
out of his mind.

1473
01:05:49,331 --> 01:05:53,260
These people are draconian
thugs, and in an evil
and twisted derby

1474
01:05:53,331 --> 01:05:55,599
between the Communists
and the Fundamentalists,

1475
01:05:55,666 --> 01:05:57,161
it's 6-to-5 and pick them,
as far as I'm concerned.

1476
01:05:57,234 --> 01:05:59,536
No, you're wrong about that,
Doc, and you know
you don't mean it.

1477
01:05:59,602 --> 01:06:03,247
In Pakistan, a blind girl
gets raped, but there's
a witness.

1478
01:06:03,316 --> 01:06:05,705
Now, in Pakistan it takes
four witnesses.

1479
01:06:05,779 --> 01:06:08,114
So the rapist walks away
and the girl is in prison.

1480
01:06:08,180 --> 01:06:09,641
Can you tell me why?

1481
01:06:09,716 --> 01:06:12,333
Well, fornication.
That's right.

1482
01:06:12,403 --> 01:06:15,305
Mr. Chairman, President Zia
is the only one willing
to shoulder the risk

1483
01:06:15,379 --> 01:06:18,412
of actively training
and funding the mujahideen

1484
01:06:18,483 --> 01:06:19,792
while Egypt
and Saudi Arabia...

1485
01:06:19,859 --> 01:06:22,478
Now, the Saudis are matching
any funding from Congress?

1486
01:06:22,548 --> 01:06:24,969
That's right.
So when you say 40 million
to me,

1487
01:06:25,044 --> 01:06:26,222
you're really talking
about 80 million.

1488
01:06:26,292 --> 01:06:27,373
Only 40 from us.

1489
01:06:27,445 --> 01:06:29,452
You want to put $80 million
in the hands of these people?

1490
01:06:29,524 --> 01:06:31,563
No, see, Doc, now, if you took
a trip with me to the border,

1491
01:06:31,635 --> 01:06:33,261
you'd stop calling them
"these people."

1492
01:06:33,332 --> 01:06:36,681
They are farmers and children
mostly, and they are fighting
our enemies for us.

1493
01:06:36,756 --> 01:06:38,185
I know.
And that should be
impossible for America.

1494
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:40,082
I know.
It should be impossible
for America

1495
01:06:40,148 --> 01:06:43,564
to sit on the bench while
little kids and their
mothers fight our enemies.

1496
01:06:43,637 --> 01:06:46,354
Now, all you have to do
to change that is to
support me

1497
01:06:46,421 --> 01:06:47,826
in the Committee,
Mr. Chairman.

1498
01:06:47,890 --> 01:06:52,048
I'm sorry, Charlie,
but doubling from 5

1801
01:24:50,078 --> 01:24:54,105
Well, here's to you,
you motherfuckers.

1802
01:24:54,175 --> 01:24:55,222
(CHEERING)

1803
01:24:55,295 --> 01:24:59,603
...determined to show
the world that the era of
Soviet military intervention

1804
01:24:59,677 --> 01:25:02,427
in other countries
is now over.

(DISCO MUSIC PLAYING)

1806
01:25:05,278 --> 01:25:09,107
CHARLIE: Well, I told you.
GUS: Told me what?

1807
01:25:09,182 --> 01:25:12,150
All we had to do
was shoot down
the helicopters.

1808
01:25:14,781 --> 01:25:17,498
Listen, not for nothing,
but do you know the story

1809
01:25:17,565 --> 01:25:19,159
about the Zen master
and the little boy?

1810
01:25:19,230 --> 01:25:20,756
Oh, is this something
from Nitsa,

1811
01:25:20,830 --> 01:25:23,514
the Greek witch of Aquilippa,
Pennsylvania?

1812
01:25:23,615 --> 01:25:25,885
Yeah, as a matter
of fact, it is.

1813
01:25:25,983 --> 01:25:27,609
(PEOPLE LAUGHING)

1814
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:30,843
There was a little boy,
and on his 14th birthday
he gets a horse.

1815
01:25:30,911 --> 01:25:33,757
And everybody in the village
says, " How wonderful!
The boy got a horse."

1816
01:25:33,823 --> 01:25:36,310
And the Zen master says,
"We'll see."

1817
01:25:36,766 --> 01:25:38,839
Two years later, the boy falls
off the horse, breaks his leg.

1818
01:25:38,911 --> 01:25:40,853
And everybody in the village
says, "How terrible!"

1819
01:25:40,926 --> 01:25:43,415
And the Zen master says,
"We'll see."

1820
01:25:43,776 --> 01:25:45,020
Then a war breaks out,

1821
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:46,517
and all the young men
have to go off and fight,

1822
01:25:46,592 --> 01:25:48,283
except the boy can't
'Cause his leg's
all messed up.

1823
01:25:48,352 --> 01:25:49,913
And everybody in the village
says, "How wonderful!"

1824
01:25:49,985 --> 01:25:52,470
And the Zen master says,
"We'll see."

1825
01:25:53,151 --> 01:25:55,060
So you get it.

1826
01:25:55,135 --> 01:25:57,557
No. No, I don't
'Cause I'm stupid.

1827
01:25:57,631 --> 01:26:00,020
You're not stupid.
You're just in Congress.

1828
01:26:00,095 --> 01:26:01,787
Send them money.
You can start
with the roads.

1829
01:26:01,855 --> 01:26:03,961
Move on to the schools,
factories.
Gus, now, it's a party.

1830
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:05,341
Restock the sheep herds.
Hey.

1831
01:26:05,407 --> 01:26:07,098
Give them jobs,
give them hope.
I'm trying. I'm trying.

1832
01:26:07,168 --> 01:26:09,055
Yeah, well, try harder.
I'm fighting
for every dollar.

1833
01:26:09,119 --> 01:26:12,599
Yeah, yeah.
I took you from 5 million
to a billion.

1834
01:26:13,054 --> 01:26:14,484
I broke the ice on the Stinger
and the MILAN.

1835
01:26:14,559 --> 01:26:17,428
I got a Democratic Congress
in lockstep behind
a Republican President.

1836
01:26:17,503 --> 01:26:18,649
Well, that's not good enough

1837
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:20,989
'Cause I'm gonna hand you
a code word classified
NIE right now,

1838
01:26:21,056 --> 01:26:22,812
and it's gonna tell you
that the crazies have
started rolling

1839
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:25,814
into Kandahar like it's
a fucking bathtub drain.

1840
01:26:26,878 --> 01:26:29,366
Jesus, Gus, you could depress
a bride on her wedding day.

1841
01:26:29,471 --> 01:26:30,486
Hey.

1842
01:26:33,824 --> 01:26:36,027
Listen to what
I'm telling you.

1843
01:26:52,832 --> 01:26:56,214
You did a hell of a job for
the son of a soda pop maker.

1844
01:26:56,800 --> 01:27:00,313
"We'll see,"
said the Zen master.

1845
01:27:15,039 --> 01:27:17,080
$1 million for school
reconstruction?

1846
01:27:17,153 --> 01:27:18,364
MAN 1: Oh, shit, Charlie.

1847
01:27:18,432 --> 01:27:21,049
Listen.
He's like the congressman
from Kabul.

1848
01:27:21,119 --> 01:27:24,698
Did you hear me say it was
a million, not a billion,
for school construction?

1849
01:27:24,767 --> 01:27:26,622
Yeah, we heard you.
Everybody heard you, buddy.

1850
01:27:26,687 --> 01:27:28,281
They heard you in Dover,
Delaware.

1851
01:27:28,352 --> 01:27:29,759
Well, I sure hope I'm not
annoying you, Bob,

1852
01:27:29,825 --> 01:27:31,614
'Cause that's the last thing
I want to do.
Look...

1853
01:27:31,681 --> 01:27:34,528
I was in the Roosevelt Room
with the President last week.

1854
01:27:34,592 --> 01:27:35,640
You know what he said?

1855
01:27:35,713 --> 01:27:37,816
He said, " Afghanistan?
Is that still going on?"

1856
01:27:37,887 --> 01:27:39,229
Well, it is.

1857
01:27:39,391 --> 01:27:40,798
Half the population
of that country

1858
01:27:40,863 --> 01:27:42,140
is under the age of 14.
Charlie.

1859
01:27:42,208 --> 01:27:45,656
Half the population is
under the age of 14.

1860
01:27:46,497 --> 01:27:47,926
Now, think how fucking
dangerous that is.

1861
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,619
They're gonna come home
and find their families
are dead,

1862
01:27:50,689 --> 01:27:52,151
their villages have
been napalmed.

1863
01:27:52,225 --> 01:27:54,876
And we helped kill the guys
who did it.
Yeah, but they don't
know that, Bob,

1864
01:27:54,946 --> 01:27:56,831
'Cause they don't
get home delivery
of The New York Times.

1865
01:27:56,896 --> 01:27:59,962
And even if they did,
it was covert, remember?

1866
01:28:00,672 --> 01:28:04,317
This is what we always do.
We always go in with
our ideals

1867
01:28:04,385 --> 01:28:07,102
and we change the world
and then we leave.

1868
01:28:07,457 --> 01:28:08,984
We always leave.

1869
01:28:09,377 --> 01:28:12,061
But that ball, though,
it keeps on bouncing.

1870
01:28:12,129 --> 01:28:14,429
What?
The ball keeps on bouncing.

1871
01:28:14,624 --> 01:28:15,901
MAN 2: Yeah, we're
a little busy right now

1872

reorganizing Eastern Europe,
don't you think?

1873
01:28:17,888 --> 01:28:19,579
We've spent billions.

1874
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:23,290
Let's spend a million
on H.R.118 and rebuild
a school.

1875
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:26,743
Charlie, nobody gives a shit
about a school in Pakistan.

1876
01:28:27,329 --> 01:28:28,671
