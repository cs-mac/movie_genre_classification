00:03:27,369 --> 00:03:32,773
Well, um, same-store sales
are up 8.4% this quarter...

15
00:03:32,874 --> 00:03:34,967
which is just... amazing.

across every demographic.

[Whimpering]

469
00:48:33,005 --> 00:48:36,497
Ándale.
[Laughs]

470
00:48:36,709 --> 00:48:39,303
[Man]
Thank God old Mr. Nathan come in.

471
00:48:39,411 --> 00:48:41,402
He took one look at me.
Said, "Harry...

472
00:48:41,514 --> 00:48:44,779
"you are the scariest
fucking clown I've ever seen.

473
00:48:44,884 --> 00:48:48,285
Take that off immediately."
And that was that.

474
00:48:48,387 --> 00:48:50,947
I came about that close
to becoming the first Mickey.

475
00:48:51,056 --> 00:48:54,856
Which would have been a disaster,
because I'd have probably killed somebody.

476
00:48:56,095 --> 00:49:01,089
Mmm. What do you think?
I know it's not Mickeys.

477
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,794
- Mmm.
- But it's good, right? Good burger.

478
00:49:03,903 --> 00:49:06,531
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's-It's great.

479
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:08,766
[Clears Throat]

480
00:49:08,874 --> 00:49:12,275
- Harry, what's goin' on out at U.M. P?
- Beg your pardon?

481
00:49:12,378 --> 00:49:16,280
Yeah, what's really goin' on out there
with the meat?

482
00:49:16,382 --> 00:49:18,646
You're supposed to be
our conduit to that place.

483
00:49:18,751 --> 00:49:21,982
- They didn't give you the tour?
- Yeah. Yeah.

484
00:49:22,087 --> 00:49:24,521
Who took you through there?

485
00:49:24,657 --> 00:49:26,557
Uh, Terry?

486
00:49:26,659 --> 00:49:28,854
- Oh, boy.
- No, no, no.

487
00:49:28,961 --> 00:49:30,952
He was... Listen, he was great.
He was fîne.

488
00:49:31,063 --> 00:49:33,031
I just...
[Sighs]

489
00:49:33,132 --> 00:49:35,225
I've been talkin'
to a lot of people around town...

490
00:49:35,334 --> 00:49:37,461
and I've been hearing
some bad things about that plant.

491
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:40,334
You know, things
they don't show you on the tour.

492
00:49:42,074 --> 00:49:45,009
Sounds like they might be running
the production line too fast, you know?

493
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:48,307
- Hmm.
- People are gettin' hurt out there every day.

494
00:49:48,414 --> 00:49:50,974
They're gettin'cut up.

495
00:49:51,083 --> 00:49:53,074
One guy lost his entire arm.

496
00:49:54,486 --> 00:49:56,477
These poor Mexicans,
they come over here...

497
00:49:56,589 --> 00:49:59,057
and U.M.P. Treats 'em like shit.

498
00:49:59,158 --> 00:50:01,126
And the meat...
I gotta tell you somethin'.

499
00:50:01,227 --> 00:50:03,354
Harry, the meat is fîlthy.

500
00:50:03,462 --> 00:50:06,727
Do you know they got untrained people
workin' at the gut table?

501
00:50:06,832 --> 00:50:09,892
- Really? The gut table?
- Yeah. I mean...

502
00:50:10,002 --> 00:50:13,836
- Harry, there's shit in our meat.
- [Woman] Harry.

503
00:50:13,939 --> 00:50:15,907
- Hi.
- Hey.

504
00:50:16,008 --> 00:50:18,340
- I heard you were here today.
- How are you doin', huh?

505
00:50:18,444 --> 00:50:21,743
- Ah, can't complain.
- Good. Lisa, I want you to meet Don Anderson.

506
00:50:21,847 --> 00:50:26,341
- He just came to the company from CNN.
- ESPN actually.

507
00:50:26,452 --> 00:50:28,886
- Don is the inventor of the Big One.
- Really?

508
00:50:28,988 --> 00:50:31,013
No. My team came up with the name.

509
00:50:31,123 --> 00:50:34,115
You're just being humble.
It was pure genius, Don.

510
00:50:34,226 --> 00:50:36,626
- It's a good name for a burger, isn't it?
- It sure is.

511
00:50:36,729 --> 00:50:40,392
It's very nice to meet you.
Can I get you another Fat Tire?

512
00:50:40,499 --> 00:50:43,059
I would love another Fat Tire.
You want a beer, Don?

513
00:50:43,168 --> 00:50:45,068
- No, thanks.
- Just one.

514
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:47,263
- All right.
- Just one. All right.

515
00:50:49,808 --> 00:50:52,106
Mmm!

516
00:50:59,051 --> 00:51:00,951
You know...

517
00:51:01,053 --> 00:51:04,545
I think there might be a little bit of shit
right here in this meat.

518
00:51:04,657 --> 00:51:07,285
Just a teeny little bit.
Microscopic.

519
00:51:07,393 --> 00:51:12,797
Your tests say that the meat
we're getting from U.M.P. Is clean.

520
00:51:12,898 --> 00:51:16,766
It's not. I've seen independent tests
that say that it's not.

521
00:51:16,869 --> 00:51:18,928
There's always been
a little shit in the meat.

522
00:51:19,038 --> 00:51:21,006
You've probably been
eatin' it your whole life.

523
00:51:21,106 --> 00:51:24,667
Yeah? Well, I prefer not to, Harry.

524
00:51:24,777 --> 00:51:28,042
Well, I don't know
who you been talkin' to, Don...

525
00:51:28,147 --> 00:51:32,447
but there is absolutely nothing illegal
goin' on here, okay?

526
00:51:32,551 --> 00:51:34,678
Meat is supposed to be cooked.

527
00:51:34,787 --> 00:51:37,813
And the grills at Mickeys
are calibrated carefully...

528
00:51:37,923 --> 00:51:43,122
to make sure it kills every little bit
of the bad stuff that's in there.

529
00:51:43,228 --> 00:51:45,492
- That might be kinda tough
to explain to our customers.
- Explain what?

530
00:51:45,597 --> 00:51:48,964
Listen, there is cow shit in our meat
because we're running the line too fast.

531
00:51:49,068 --> 00:51:52,435
Just cook it.
That's all you need to do.

532
00:51:52,538 --> 00:51:56,565
You see? That's one of the things
that's just buggin'me about this country.

533
00:51:56,675 --> 00:51:58,575
Really buggin' me.

534
00:51:58,677 --> 00:52:01,737
Americans have become
these-these great big fraidy cats.

535
00:52:01,847 --> 00:52:05,806
Afraid of everything.
Everything's gotta be sterile and germfree.

536
00:52:05,918 --> 00:52:07,886
- Well, everybody needs to grow up.
- [Loud Slap]

537
00:52:07,986 --> 00:52:10,819
That's what they need.

538
00:52:10,923 --> 00:52:13,949
You wanna be safe?
Huh? Perfectly safe?

539
00:52:14,059 --> 00:52:16,721
Well, forget about it.
That's not gonna happen. Okay?

540
00:52:16,829 --> 00:52:18,797
Everybody just needs
to get that through their head.

541
00:52:18,897 --> 00:52:22,799
Just cook the meat,
and you'll be fîne.

542
00:52:24,036 --> 00:52:26,004
I can't believe I'm hearing this.

543
00:52:26,105 --> 00:52:28,767
You've known all about this?

544
00:52:28,874 --> 00:52:30,842
I'm shocked.

545
00:52:33,545 --> 00:52:37,072
Donny boy, you just gotta try and step back
and look at the big picture.

546
00:52:37,182 --> 00:52:41,516
40,000 people die
in automobile accidents every year.

547
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:43,588
Does that mean Detroit
should stop making cars?

548
00:52:43,689 --> 00:52:45,748
Does it?

549
00:52:45,858 --> 00:52:49,055
- Of course not.
- [Sighs]

550
00:52:49,161 --> 00:52:51,186
You ever been down to Mexico?

551
00:52:51,296 --> 00:52:53,389
- What's that have to do with anything?
- It's beautiful down there.

552
00:52:53,499 --> 00:52:56,730
Really beautiful.
Great beaches. Gorgeous.

553
00:52:56,835 --> 00:53:00,032
But poor. Poor.

554
00:53:00,139 --> 00:53:02,403
Poorest fuckin'place
I ever been, I think.

555
00:53:02,508 --> 00:53:06,842
Guy down there makes three,
maybe four dollars a day.

556
00:53:06,945 --> 00:53:08,845
A day, Don.

557
00:53:08,947 --> 00:53:12,212
Now, that same guy,
he comes up here...

558
00:53:12,317 --> 00:53:14,717
he gets a job workin' for U.M.P. 

559
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:16,788
makin' $10 an hour.

560
00:53:16,889 --> 00:53:22,191
That's more money in one day
than he makes back home in a whole month.

561
00:53:22,294 --> 00:53:25,286
So, frankly, I don't see the problem.

562
00:53:25,397 --> 00:53:29,231
Nobody's makin' these people
come up here. Right?

563
00:53:29,334 --> 00:53:31,859
Nobody's tellin' them
to come work for U.M.P.

564
00:53:31,970 --> 00:53:34,234
- Okay, okay. But that's not the point.
- And you know what?

565
00:53:34,339 --> 00:53:36,330
I admire these people. Okay?

566
00:53:36,442 --> 00:53:38,774
I really do.
They're hard workers.

567
00:53:38,877 --> 00:53:42,745
They're workin' hard, and they're trying
to improve their lives. Okay?

568
00:53:42,848 --> 00:53:44,816
Now, isn't that
what our ancestors did?

569
00:53:44,917 --> 00:53:49,320
Isn't that what made this country
the great country that it is today? Huh?

570
00:53:49,421 --> 00:53:51,389
And you wanna try and stop 'em?

571
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:54,516
You wanna tell 'em
that you know what's best for 'em?

572
00:53:54,626 --> 00:53:57,652
Well, most people don't like
to be told what's best for 'em.

573
00:53:57,763 --> 00:54:01,631
Well, what's goin' on
at U.M.P. Is unacceptable.

574
00:54:01,733 --> 00:54:04,327
And I'm gonna have
to tellJack about all this.

575
00:54:04,436 --> 00:54:06,336
[Laughs]

576
00:54:06,438 --> 00:54:08,998
Oh. Gonna tellJack, huh?

577
00:54:17,483 --> 00:54:20,316
I've been workin' for this company
almost 30 years.

578
00:54:20,419 --> 00:54:22,751
Hell, I grew up right down the street
from the Nathans...

579
00:54:22,855 --> 00:54:25,119
when we were all back in Muncie.

580
00:54:25,224 --> 00:54:29,593
So, here's my little piece
of friendly advice to you, Donny boy.

581
00:54:31,363 --> 00:54:34,855
I'd be careful
how close I got toJack.

582
00:54:34,967 --> 00:54:37,993
See, your boyJack
is about this close...

583
00:54:38,103 --> 00:54:40,401
to gettin' his tit
caught in the ringer.

584
00:54:40,506 --> 00:54:43,532
He's under investigation, okay?

585
00:54:43,642 --> 00:54:46,805
Cookin'the books,
paddin'his expense account.

586
00:54:46,912 --> 00:54:50,313
Not to mention
bonin' his own secretary, okay?

587
00:54:50,415 --> 00:54:53,873
- And that is not the kind of
company that we want to run.
- Louise?

588
00:54:53,986 --> 00:54:55,886
That's right.

589
00:54:55,988 --> 00:55:00,186
Your buddyJack's got two,
maybe three months before he's out the door.

590
00:55:00,292 --> 00:55:03,125
- Could be sooner.
- He's sleeping with Louise?

591
00:55:03,228 --> 00:55:05,128
And you know what, Don?

592
00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:07,892
You should be thankin' me
instead of doin' all this complainin'.

593
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,299
I negotiated a hell
of a good price with U.M.P.

594
00:55:11,403 --> 00:55:15,396
Okay? I negotiated a great price
for your fuckin' meat.

595
00:55:15,507 --> 00:55:19,409
Hell, if it weren't for me,
there wouldn't be no Big One, Don.

596
00:55:19,511 --> 00:55:21,411
I'd like to see you fînd a supplier...

597
00:55:21,513 --> 00:55:23,913
that will sell you Grade "A" chuck
at 40 cents a pound.

598
00:55:24,016 --> 00:55:26,280
I'd like to see that.

599
00:55:27,352 --> 00:55:29,877
Have-Have you ever met Louise?

600
00:55:29,988 --> 00:55:32,320
Have I ever met her?

601
00:55:32,424 --> 00:55:34,892
Twenty years ago,
I gave her that job.

602
00:55:34,993 --> 00:55:37,484
She was a good-lookin' woman
back then too.

603
00:55:37,596 --> 00:55:39,564
[Sighs]

604
00:55:42,434 --> 00:55:45,665
It is a sad fact oflife, Don.

605
00:55:45,771 --> 00:55:48,331
But the truth is...

606
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:51,204
we all have to eat a little shit
from time to time.

607
00:55:51,310 --> 00:55:54,541
But just for the record, I want you to know
that I'm with you on this.

608
00:55:54,646 --> 00:55:57,046
Okay? I really am.
I'm gonna go down there.

609
00:55:57,149 --> 00:55:59,049
I'm gonna see
what the hell's goin' on.

610
00:55:59,151 --> 00:56:01,051
If I have to,
I'm gonna kick some ass.

611
00:56:02,754 --> 00:56:04,722
You know what, Harry?

612
00:56:06,425 --> 00:56:08,393
I don't think
that's gonna be good enough.

613
00:56:10,295 --> 00:56:13,958
You seem like
a real bright guy, Don.

614
00:56:14,066 --> 00:56:17,229
I'd hate to see you get caught up
in something you couldn't get out of.

615
00:56:18,537 --> 00:56:20,505
Give it some thought.

616

There is something defînitely weird
going on between Jack and Harry...

00:56:44,062 --> 00:56:46,223
and, either way,
I can lose this job.

That's not gonna happen.

Well, just tellJay
to wait a moment.

I, uh... I've been out to the plant.
I spoke to some workers.

633
00:57:45,323 --> 00:57:48,417
I even tracked down
this old rancher...

who's dealt with these guys for years.

So, there's a lot of things, but--

Yeah. No, of course
I met with Harry.

Yeah. He's- He's an interesting guy.
You were right.

But I- I don't think that he's...
a crook.

I would probably recommend...

00:58:18,490 --> 00:58:21,584

make those cages big enough to be legal...

to get outta here to do that.

769
01:08:18,356 --> 01:08:20,620
Was it hard leaving Cody
back when you were a teenager?

770
01:08:20,725 --> 01:08:24,422
No, not for me. Your mom, though,
that was a different story.

771
01:08:24,529 --> 01:08:27,191
I was on the way.
Kinda cuts down on your options.

772
01:08:27,298 --> 01:08:31,860
Mm-hmm. That is why,
if, by the age of 21...

773
01:08:31,969 --> 01:08:34,836
you have not missed
one menstrual cycle...

774
01:08:34,939 --> 01:08:39,967
- I will give you $1,000.
- Will you shut up? Okay?

775
01:08:40,078 --> 01:08:44,344
- I am not talking to my uncle about sex.
- Okay.

776
01:08:44,449 --> 01:08:46,644
I read this study
the other day about, uh...

777
01:08:46,751 --> 01:08:49,117
people who are happiest
with their lives.

778
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:51,780
And, uh, the ones who have
followed their passion, right...

779
01:08:51,889 --> 01:08:54,687
even if they weren't, you know,
technically successful, right?

780
01:08:54,792 --> 01:08:58,091
When they were looking back
at their life, they had fewer regrets.

781
01:08:58,196 --> 01:09:01,393
You know, they felt their life
had been more fulfîlling.

782
01:09:01,499 --> 01:09:04,866
- Yeah, that makes sense, I guess.
- Yeah, it does.

783
01:09:04,969 --> 01:09:08,871
So, bottom line is, do not listen to me.
Do not listen to your mother.

784
01:09:08,973 --> 01:09:11,703
Listen to yourself.

785
01:09:11,809 --> 01:09:13,834
I mean, if you wanna be
like everybody else...

786
01:09:13,945 --> 01:09:15,845
just do what everybody's
telling you to do.

787
01:09:15,947 --> 01:09:17,847
Hmm.

788
01:09:19,350 --> 01:09:23,184
And what about you? Are you doing
what you always wanted to do?

789
01:09:24,756 --> 01:09:28,886
Well, if I jump back
to when I was your age...

790
01:09:28,993 --> 01:09:31,518
No, I don't think
I would be wildly impressed.

791
01:09:31,629 --> 01:09:33,529
All right? I don't-  I-

792
01:09:33,631 --> 01:09:38,261
But, you know, I'm all right
with what I'm doing.

793
01:09:38,369 --> 01:09:41,270
And, you know, I'm really all right
with what I'm not doing.

794
01:09:44,475 --> 01:09:46,409
- Is that your move?
- Yeah.

795
01:09:46,511 --> 01:09:48,502
- Thuh-bop!
- Dang it.

796
01:09:48,613 --> 01:09:50,513
Yep. So...

797

[Sing-Song]
Hello.

798
01:09:52,683 --> 01:09:56,517
- Amber, why are you still up?
- Well, why do you have my poncho on?

799
01:09:56,621 --> 01:09:59,283
- It's fîne.
- How was it, hmm?

800
01:09:59,390 --> 01:10:02,689
- [Sighs]
- Well, she's home fairly early,
if that signifîes anything.

801
01:10:02,794 --> 01:10:06,628
Oh, no, no, no. That doesn't mean anything.
Your mother...She's amazing.

802
01:10:06,731 --> 01:10:09,723
You wouldn't believe what she could
get accomplished in a short period of time.

803
01:10:09,834 --> 01:10:11,631
- Screw you both.
- [Gasps]

804
01:10:11,736 --> 01:10:14,967
- [Chuckles]
- Hey, Sis. Sis. Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey.

805
01:10:15,072 --> 01:10:18,701
So, what would you say?
Is Cody a better town today...

806
01:10:18,810 --> 01:10:21,779
- or back when we were kids?
- Well, I know what you would say.

807
01:10:21,879 --> 01:10:24,245
- What?
- Your uncle hates everything, Amber.

808
01:10:24,348 --> 01:10:27,647
You know, I actually think it's better now.
There's more stuff to do.

809
01:10:27,752 --> 01:10:32,189
Oh, yeah. There's more to do. You got
the Wal-Mart, the Kmart and the Target, right?

810
01:10:32,290 --> 01:10:34,485
You got Chuck E. Cheese.
You got Taco Bell.

811
01:10:34,592 --> 01:10:37,618
You got Arby's.
You got Mickeys. You got Denny's.

812
01:10:37,728 --> 01:10:39,787
You've got, uh, Chili's.

813
01:10:39,897 --> 01:10:43,060
You got Applebee's. You got Wendy's.
You got Hardee's, right?

814
01:10:43,167 --> 01:10:45,067
You got the... the K.F.C., the IHOP.

815
01:10:45,169 --> 01:10:47,797
- [Shrieks]
- [Groans] Do they still have
that Der Wienerschnitzel?

816
01:10:47,905 --> 01:10:50,738
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, thank God it's still hanging in there.

817
01:10:50,842 --> 01:10:53,538
I don't know about you,
but I could just piss away...

818
01:10:53,644 --> 01:10:55,612
a whole Sunday afternoon
at the Sunglass Hut.

819
01:10:55,713 --> 01:10:57,738
- You know?
- Have you ever been to the Sunglass Hut?

820
01:10:57,849 --> 01:11:01,182
No, I never have. I'm not trying to come off
like some Polly Perfect here.

821
01:11:01,285 --> 01:11:03,185
I'm going to make some cabinets...

822
01:11:03,287 --> 01:11:05,619
for some rich
New York investment banker fuck...

823
01:11:05,723 --> 01:11:09,989
who probably spends two weeks a year
at his Montana ranch, so don't listen to me.

824
01:11:10,094 --> 01:11:13,154
- I'm not.
- I'm not talking to you.
I'm talking to your daughter.

825
01:11:13,264 --> 01:11:16,290
I'm probably just going through some
full-of-shit, early middle-age period.

826
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,595
I don't think you're full of shit.

827
01:11:18,703 --> 01:11:21,866
Thank you. She's so nice.
What happened to you?

828
01:11:21,973 --> 01:11:25,534
No, no, sweetheart, don't contradict your mother.
He is full of shit.

829
01:11:25,643 --> 01:11:28,111
I don't waste a lot of time
thinking about this stuff.

830

- [Groans]
- Democrats, Republicans...

831

- They're all crooks.
- This is why revolutions are meant for the young.

No wonder you're not still married.

- Stupid... stupidity.
- Yeah, look. Hey, the facts are not always friendly.

837
01:11:46,597 --> 01:11:48,622
Listen to who's giving
the lecture here, Amber.

838
01:11:48,733 --> 01:11:50,633
Your uncle did not fînish college.

839
01:11:50,735 --> 01:11:53,363
- Jesus! Mm-hmm. Oh!
- Okay?

840
01:11:53,471 --> 01:11:58,033
- He lived in a camper for 18 months.
- An Airstream!

841
01:11:58,142 --> 01:12:00,110
- This is not a role model.
- [Bottles Clanking]

after he leaves.

843
01:12:02,313 --> 01:12:04,577
Hey, Mom said you got
kicked out of college.

844
01:12:04,682 --> 01:12:08,846
- Oh, well, thanks, Mom.
- Yeah, your mug shots are in all the papers.

845
01:12:08,953 --> 01:12:13,151
Yeah, with eight others. I was at
Colorado University. We were the C.U. Nine.

846
01:12:13,257 --> 01:12:18,456
Yeah, that notorious band
of Midwestern, white freedom fighters.

847
01:12:18,563 --> 01:12:20,861
No, no, no.
We took over the chancellor's offîce.

848
01:12:20,965 --> 01:12:24,059
All right, we were protesting
the college's investment in South Africa.

849
01:12:24,168 --> 01:12:27,262
- So what happened?
- All right, well, so, after about four hours...

850
01:12:27,371 --> 01:12:30,169
- they come bursting through this barricade.
- Okay, that was two chalkboards.

851
01:12:30,274 --> 01:12:32,174
- It's not two chalkboards.
- It was too.

852
01:12:32,276 --> 01:12:35,040
We had rope with some chair.
They practically beat the shit out of all of us.

853
01:12:35,146 --> 01:12:37,046
They treated us
like a band of terrorists.

854
01:12:37,148 --> 01:12:39,048
You got your little ass
kicked out of college...

855
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:41,050
- which he never fînished.
- Big deal.

856
01:12:41,152 --> 01:12:44,121
- It cost our dad $2,000 in legal fees.
- I eventually paid him back.

About a year later, the college divests
all its holdings in South Africa...

859

and a little while after that,
Nelson Mandela is a free man.

860
01:12:52,830 --> 01:12:57,233
- All because of the "C.U. Nine."
- No, nobody said that. Nobody even thought that.

861
01:12:57,335 --> 01:13:00,771
The point is... that, you know,
if enough people...

862
01:13:00,871 --> 01:13:03,601
start thinking about something
and trying to actually do something...

863
01:13:03,708 --> 01:13:05,608
you can change things
for the better.

864
01:13:05,710 --> 01:13:08,144
I believe that.

865
01:13:08,245 --> 01:13:10,577
- I hope they can change for the better.
- Don't just hope.

866
01:13:10,681 --> 01:13:12,876
You can't sit back and hope.
You have to do something.

01:13:12,984 --> 01:13:14,884
In a town like this,

01:28:29,279 --> 01:28:31,713
puts out 50 pounds
of piss and shit every day.

1069
01:28:31,815 --> 01:28:33,749
- Fifty pounds each.
- [Alice] Lovely.

1070
01:28:33,850 --> 01:28:36,819
Yeah, I know.
So, that U.M.P. Feedlot...

1071
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:39,354
produces more waste
every single day...

1072
01:28:39,456 --> 01:28:42,152
than all of the people
in Denver combined.

1073
01:28:42,259 --> 01:28:44,193
- [Alice] That's gross.
- [Andrew] Yeah.

1074
01:28:44,294 --> 01:28:46,660
And- And the waste
from U.M.P.'s feedlot, it's-it's--

1075
01:28:46,763 --> 01:28:49,630
It's not going to some
high-tech treatment plant, you know?

1076
01:28:49,733 --> 01:28:51,633
It's being pumped
into these lagoons...

1077
01:28:51,735 --> 01:28:55,193
which are these just great big ponds
of piss and shit.

1078
01:28:55,305 --> 01:28:59,332
And these great big shit ponds
are leaking shit into Peyton Creek...

1079
01:28:59,443 --> 01:29:01,343
which eventually ends up
in the river.

1080
01:29:01,445 --> 01:29:05,211
I mean, you should see it. U.M.P. 's cattle,
they're all just crammed together...

1081
01:29:05,315 --> 01:29:08,682
living in their own manure,
eating this genetically engineered crap...

1082
01:29:08,785 --> 01:29:12,016
that's being dumped into
these concrete troughs for them.

1083
01:29:12,122 --> 01:29:14,317
It's like prison camps for cows.

1084
01:29:14,424 --> 01:29:18,019
You wouldn't believe it.
You can smell it, like, three miles away.

1085
01:29:18,128 --> 01:29:22,189
So Professor Cohen is gonna help us
coordinate a letter-writing campaign...

1086
01:29:22,299 --> 01:29:24,460
not only
to the state water quality board...

1087
01:29:24,568 --> 01:29:28,060
- but to various editorial organizations.
- Are you kidding me?

1088
01:29:28,171 --> 01:29:29,900
Excuse me?

1089
01:29:30,006 --> 01:29:33,203
You guys are gonna write a letter.

1090
01:29:33,310 --> 01:29:36,370
That company is the meanest
fucking company I've ever seen.

1091
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:40,246
They treat their workers like shit.
They treat the animals like shit.

1092
01:29:40,350 --> 01:29:42,944
They're dumping tons of shit
and piss into our river...

1093
01:29:43,053 --> 01:29:45,578
- and you guys are gonna write a letter?
- Yes, Paco...

1094
01:29:45,689 --> 01:29:48,886
as an offîcial warning, to be followed
by a campus-wide boycott...

1095
01:29:48,992 --> 01:29:51,222
of everything that comes
out of that place.

1096
01:29:51,328 --> 01:29:55,321
The governor got $200,000
from U.M.P. Last year.

1097
01:29:55,432 --> 01:29:57,696
Cathy Crawford?

1098
01:29:57,801 --> 01:30:01,532
Head of the environmental committee
in the state senate?

1099
01:30:01,638 --> 01:30:04,630
She's married to a U.M.P. Top exec.

1100
01:30:04,741 --> 01:30:07,767
And you guys are gonna
write a letter.

1101
01:30:07,878 --> 01:30:10,039
What a fucking waste of time.

1102
01:30:10,147 --> 01:30:14,015
Listen, you have gotta start somewhere
in raising awareness.

1103
01:30:14,117 --> 01:30:17,177
No, this is bullshit,
this environmental policy discussion group.

1104
01:30:17,287 --> 01:30:20,256
Even our name sucks.

1105
01:30:20,357 --> 01:30:23,292
Did you just make this up so you could put it
on your grad school applications, Andrew?

1106
01:30:23,393 --> 01:30:25,657
Do you have a better idea, Gerald?

1107
01:30:25,762 --> 01:30:28,754
- Excuse me, I'm- I'm sorry, "Paco"?
- Fuck you, man.

1108
01:30:28,865 --> 01:30:31,493
Are you just here
to be the self-righteous critic, man?

1109
01:30:31,601 --> 01:30:36,436
I don't know, man.
Action speaks louder.

1110
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:38,838
I'm tired of nice people sitting around
talking and complaining...

1111
01:30:38,942 --> 01:30:41,103
while the bad guys get to do
whatever the fuck they want.

1112
01:30:41,211 --> 01:30:45,545
- I wanna see some action.
- We all do, dude. That's what we're doing here.

1113
01:30:45,649 --> 01:30:47,879
Those Greenpeace dudes,
they put their asses on the line.

1114
01:30:47,984 --> 01:30:51,545
That's exactly what we should do.

1115
01:30:51,655 --> 01:30:55,421
You said that there's, like,
a hundred thousand cows, right?

1116
01:30:55,525 --> 01:30:57,550
- Uh, roughly.
- Well...

1117
01:30:57,661 --> 01:31:00,095
what if we cut the fence...

1118
01:31:01,331 --> 01:31:04,789
and let them out?

1119
01:31:04,901 --> 01:31:07,563
Let them run free.
I mean, that...

1120
01:31:07,671 --> 01:31:09,571
That might get some attention.

1121
01:31:09,673 --> 01:31:13,939
See? That's the kind of shit I'm talking about.
What's your name?

1122
01:31:14,044 --> 01:31:17,138
- Amber.
- Beautiful, Amber.

1123
01:31:18,782 --> 01:31:20,909
Well, think about it.

1124
01:31:21,017 --> 01:31:26,011
I mean, if you suddenly had thousands
and thousands of cows...

1125
01:31:26,122 --> 01:31:28,113
you know, wandering free...

1126
01:31:28,225 --> 01:31:30,352
wandering back to the prairie
where they belong...

1127
01:31:30,460 --> 01:31:34,123
causing traffîc jams,
blocking the highway...

1128
01:31:34,231 --> 01:31:37,928
you're reminding people that cows aren't
supposed to be penned up and treated that way.

1129
01:31:38,034 --> 01:31:41,026
You know, that's a really good idea.

1130
01:31:41,137 --> 01:31:44,504
Because then we could issue
a press release with our demands...

1131
01:31:44,608 --> 01:31:48,135
showing what a disaster that company is
and what we're gonna do next.

1132
01:31:48,245 --> 01:31:50,338
We- We can do all this.

1133
01:31:50,447 --> 01:31:53,848
I'm just-  I'm warning you guys
that right now in this country...

1134
01:31:53,950 --> 01:31:56,214
any destruction of private property
along these lines...

1135
01:31:56,319 --> 01:31:58,617
can be considered
in violation of the Patriot Act.

1136
01:31:58,722 --> 01:32:01,190
It can be considered
an act of terrorism.

1137
01:32:01,291 --> 01:32:03,486
You can go to prison
for, like, 10 years.

1138
01:32:03,593 --> 01:32:05,959
- Yeah, it's a bunch of bullshit.
- [Andrew] I know.

1139
01:32:06,062 --> 01:32:08,326
I know. We have entered
a whole new era...

1140
01:32:08,431 --> 01:32:10,831
where they can search your house
without a warrant.

1141
01:32:10,934 --> 01:32:13,334
They can put you in jail
without a trial.

1142
01:32:13,436 --> 01:32:16,667
Eco-activists that have
never harmed another human being...

1143
01:32:16,773 --> 01:32:21,107
are considered by our government to be
more of a threat to national security...

1144
01:32:21,211 --> 01:32:24,874
than all these right-wing,
Timothy McVeigh, militia types.

1145
01:32:26,983 --> 01:32:29,781
Well, right now I can't think
of anything more patriotic...

1146
01:32:29,886 --> 01:32:31,979
than violating the Patriot Act.

1147

This industry's fucked.

1152
01:34:37,480 --> 01:34:40,210
There's rumors U.M.P.'s plannin'
to sell the plant or shut us down.

1153
01:34:41,685 --> 01:34:45,246
They got plants all over the U.S.,
fuckin' Canada.

1154
01:34:45,355 --> 01:34:48,290
Cody plant don't start pulling its weight,
yeah, they'll shut us down.

1155
01:34:48,391 --> 01:34:51,053
Don't matter we've been here
35 fuckin' years.

1156
01:34:51,161 --> 01:34:55,325
Don't give a fuck about Cody, and they
sure as shit don't give a fuck about me.

Come on. Here you go.

- [Paco] What the fuck is wrong with them?

1178
01:36:28,224 --> 01:36:33,093
- Hey, get your asses in gear!
- How stupid are they?

1179
01:36:33,196 --> 01:36:35,892
Show them there's a hole in the fence.
I don't think they can see it.

1180
01:36:35,999 --> 01:36:40,493
Come on. Lookit! Lookit!
There's no fence. Run!

Look, nobody got arrested.
Nobody got hurt.

1203
01:37:50,106 --> 01:37:52,006
Yeah, and we learned something.

1204
01:37:52,108 --> 01:37:55,839
- Yeah?
- Don't try something unless
you know what you're doing.

1205
01:37:55,945 --> 01:37:59,745
Next time, we bring cattle prods.
That was our only mistake.

01:37:59,849 --> 01:38:02,909
Oh, yeah. That's a good one.
Paco, ace cattle rustler from New Jersey.

1207
01:38:03,019 --> 01:38:05,920
Fuck you.
At least we tried, man.

1208
01:38:06,022 --> 01:38:07,922
Better than sitting on our asses.

1209
01:38:08,024 --> 01:38:11,721
I just don't understand.
Why would they wanna stay in there?

1210
01:38:11,828 --> 01:38:14,661
Well, let's face it.
Cows aren't the brightest animals.

1211
01:38:14,764 --> 01:38:17,961
Who knows?
Maybe it's easier in there.

1212
01:38:18,067 --> 01:38:19,557
They get all the food they want.

1213
01:38:19,669 --> 01:38:22,194
I bet that genetically engineered shit
tastes better than grass.

Did you see how fuckin' fast he ran?

Oh, yeah, yeah.
And you were right behind me, fucker.

1217
01:38:29,979 --> 01:38:31,879
I don't know.

1218
01:38:31,981 --> 01:38:34,176
How come, in real life,
the bad guys always win?

1219
01:38:34,284 --> 01:38:37,583
[Andrew]
Well, you know, they do until they don't.

1231
01:46:17,947 --> 01:46:20,939
Which all adds up
to us believing that next quarter...

1232
01:46:21,050 --> 01:46:24,076
will be the best time
to introduce a major new product.

the Barbecue Big One...

1237
01:46:36,766 --> 01:46:39,064
has been testing off the charts
for months.

1238
01:46:39,168 --> 01:46:41,534
And, uh, I really feel like...

1239
01:46:41,637 --> 01:46:44,936
the marketing department's
nailed the campaign, Jack.

So, it's obviously time
for the big launch. And...

1241
01:46:53,783 --> 01:46:55,683
we couldn't be more ready to go.
