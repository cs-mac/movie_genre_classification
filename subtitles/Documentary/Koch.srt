1
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:25,321
The civil war between the Sri Lankan army
and the Tamil Tigers militia

2
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,082
has caused more than 100,000 deaths to date.

3
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,047
For this reason,
many Tamils have left their homes in Sri Lanka.

4
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,168
About 40,000 of them
are now living in Switzerland.

5
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,007
ZURICH, SWITZERLAND

6
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,203
Maravan, rotary evaporator.

7
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,970
Mackerel with wild garlic sabayon,
poached salmon, and fire the 7.

8
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,891
Coming right up. Maravan, carob gum.

9
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,761
Maravan.

10
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,246
Carob gum.

11
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,161
For warm foam,
guar flour is better than carob gum.

12
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,084
Or your sabayon will collapse.

13
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,202
You're teaching me how to cook?

14
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,684
Did you hear that? Maravan's teaching us
how to cook. He can do better.

15
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,648
So, one wild garlic sabayon.

16
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,284
Marinated mackerel fillet on hearts-of-fennel
with wild garlic sabayon.

17
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,881
Poached salmon with lemon cream.

18
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,651
Look at that.

19
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,762
Take it back.
- Of course.

20
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,606
Is something not to your satisfaction,
Mr Dalmann?

21
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,487
Oh, yes. I'm terribly sorry.

22
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,041
May I offer you another appetizer?

23
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,922
Fine, but none of the green stuff.

24
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,284
Dreadful.

25
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,804
Such a smart ass.

26
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,208
C'mon then, Ghandi.

27
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,087
Show it to me. Here.
Show me your Indian sabayon.

28
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,086
Go on.

29
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,722
I'd love to try a sabayon
that doesn't collapse.

30
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,002
Will you make me one?

31
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,441
We need
the non-reexport explanation for the M40.

32
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,007
If you don't mind me saying,
we should conform to all formalities.

33
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,361
Arms exports to conflict zones
are getting a lot of press.

34
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,244
Yes...excuse me.

35
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,921
The American gets 8%.

36
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,969
And we have the same non-reexport

37
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,483
confirmation that's totally legal fully...

38
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,966
that's legal.

39
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,883
Look out. Careful, careful.

40
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,607
Careful...

41
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,962
Good God, Eric, Eric.

42
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,447
Hurry up now, hurry.
- Yes, yes.

43
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,889
Go clean up the puke. Go. Hurry.
- Eric.

44
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,126
Hello.

45
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,966
Ulagu!

46
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,369
See you.
- Where are you going?

47
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,920
Out.

48
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,004
Bye.
- Bye.

49
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,406
Come on.

50
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,041
We have to go. Sandana.

51
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,931
Is our nephew giving you any trouble?

52
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,531
No.

53
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,122
He's a very pleasant guest.

54
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,090
You mustn't take that.

55
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,322
It'll make your heart stop.

56
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,843
Where did she get this?

57
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,565
The doctor has strictly forbidden it.

58
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,085
Just the essence?

59
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,131
Cook for Sandana.

60
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,884
Two mackerel fillets with sabayon.
- Maravan, carob flour.

61
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,127
Maravan.

62
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,165
Ciao.
- Ciao.

63
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,161
Yes?

64
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,441
Excuse me.

65
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,045
What's up?

66
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,568
I just wanted to ask:

67
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,041
Did...

68
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,927
Did you really mean it?

69
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,811
Should I make you the sabayon?

70
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,887
Yes.

71
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,451
Why not?

72
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,927
When?

73
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,084
Whenever you want.

74
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,685
Tomorrow?

75
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,007
Before work?

76
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,931
Sure.

77
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,366
My address.

78
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,046
At yours?

79
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,085
See you tomorrow.

80
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,085
Get up.

81
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,520
Get up!

82
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,530
Do you have a reservation?

83
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,966
Yes.

84
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,366
This is the kitchen.

85
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,920
I want to open my own restaurant.

86
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,125
Is that yours?

87
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,767
No.

88
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,490
It's...

89
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,728
Actually,
all I need is a business partner who...

90
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,730
So where's your sabayon?
- All in good time.

91
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,123
Compliments of the chef.

92
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:37,926
In my restaurant I could
cook dishes from Sri Lanka and southern India,

93
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,884
but different.

94
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,326
New.

95
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,526
What's that taste?

96
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,841
My childhood.

97
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,242
Man and woman.

98
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,523
Which one's the woman?

99
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,081
Both.

100
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,811
It's cold.

101
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,846
Hard.

102
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,481
Soft.

103
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,005
Warm.

104
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,849
Do I get a fork?

105
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,130
Curry of chicken with sashtika rice

106
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,682
and coriander sabayon.
- With guar flour?

107
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,528
Mackerel with coconut and cinnamon smoke.

108
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,688
The masculine element.

109
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,451
More for me.

110
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,891
Very sweet.

111
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,284
It's a little small.

112
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,561
No?

113
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,401
Whipped mousse of ginger and asparagus
with a green mango and avocado tip.

114
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,604
I can't eat anymore.

115
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,360
There's always room for dessert.

116
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,603
I'm not finished yet.

117
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,611
A tea?

118
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,764
Are you OK?

119
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,081
I'm...

120
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,687
sorry, I...

121
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,769
didn't want to...

122
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,929
I mean it was very nice...

123
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,122
What didn't you want?

124
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,726
I..-

125
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,325
So you've got it.

126
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,886
Maravan has it.

127
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,121
Unbelievable.

128
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,680
Oh no, the Indian's got it.
And looking as innocent as Ghandi again.

129
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,846
Do you have anything to do with this?

130
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,525
With What?

131
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,606
Out.

132
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,406
Be glad I don't press charges.

133
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,404
You're finished in Zurich.

134
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,882
He'll never get another job.

135
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,045
Andrea.

136
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,161
Andrea!

137
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,368
The exit is at the back.

138
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,005
Maravan!

139
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,851
What was in the food?

140
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,644
What do you mean?

141
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,011
You know exactly what I mean.

142
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,363
No. They were all just traditional recipes.

143
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,642
I'm lesbian.

144
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,451
I don't sleep with men, only with women.

145
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,290
I know what it means.

146
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,330
So don't tell me there was nothing in the food.

147
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,210
What was in the food?
And stop lying to me.

148
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,842
Ayuveda is a healing art.

149
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,528
I know what Ayuveda is.
- Want to know or not? - Yes.

150
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,924
The eighth branch of Ayuveda
is concerned with aphrodisiacs.

151
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,806
That includes certain dishes...
- That I ate?

152
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,205
I..-

153
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,445
I wanted to ask
if you could help me with my restaurant.

154
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:51,009
I need someone with a Swiss passport.
I didn't think it'd be so strong.

155
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,124
They're my grandmother's recipes
cooked with molecular techniques.

156
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,168
You can't be serious.

157
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,804
You didn't want to screw me?

158
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,931
No.

159
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,521
I thought you'd loosen up...

160
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,201
"Loosen UP-"u

161
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,444
What are you going to do now?

162
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,964
I don't know.

163
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,962
I can ask around.

164
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,048
Lie back down.
- What?

165
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,441
Alright then:

166
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,923
Elbow.
- El... bo... bow.

167
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,087
Knee.

168
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,922
That tickles...
- "Tickles."

169
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,408
No, no, no. No, no, no.
Like this: That tickles!

170
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,809
Wash your hands.

171
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,891
Wash your hands.

172
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,929
Red Bull and vodka.

173
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:48,811
Maybe you should go
and have a Red Bull and vodka with Sandana.

174
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,088
Red Bull and vodka?

175
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,243
A new face in the community?
- Ulagu, Mahit's nephew.

176
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:36,207
He brought my grandmother to Zurich.
- So I heard.

177
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,488
So we'll see you at services?

178
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,727
He'll bring my grandmother home soon.

179
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,003
You lost your job?

180
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,122
That's what they're saying.

181
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,602
I can deliver every clay.

182
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,211
Good.

183
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,488
Sorry, we haven't discussed payment.
- 30 francs, as always.

184
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,202
You mustn't forget
that the mothagam is for use in worship.

185
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,801
Yes, 30 francs of course.

186
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,328
Can we help you find a wife?

187
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,242
Sandana isn't a good woman.

188
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,401
She neither comes to services,
nor obeys her parents.

189
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,200
Be glad she rejected you.

190
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,609
He's with the Tamil Tigers.

191
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,091
Let's go.

192
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,486
Let's go!

193
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,089
What do you have against a free Eelam?
They're fighting for you.

194
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,881
They're terrorists, so they've been banned.

195
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,727
That's in Sri Lanka.
Here, they're not banned.

196
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,725
That's because they only raise money here.

197
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,050
You have no idea what's going on back home.

198
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:51,250
The bypass we performed on Mrs Vilasam
was successful.

199
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,042
You understand?
- Yes.

200
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:59,170
But the coronary vessels are restricted.

201
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:03,724
We'll need at least one more bypass
and further operations.

202
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,320
I've prepared a cost schedule for you.

203
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,691
Excuse me.

204
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:14,322
Mrs Vilasam
would remain in hospital for a while.

205
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:18,202
So there'd be additional costs.
- We can't pay that.

206
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,609
You'll surely need time to discuss this.

207
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,569
I hope her tourist visa
is valid for the duration.

208
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,842
I can raise the money.
- You?

209
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,164
Let him.

210
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,288
How do you do that?
- What?

211
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,841
Make your hair stand up?

212
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,201
Maravan.

213
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,487
Wait.

214
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:44,322
It's too much money. You can't pay it all.

215
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,568
I can contribute something.

216
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,526
She's my grandmother.
- I know but...

217
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,486
Nangay was there for my family, too.

218
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,244
Please, let me help.
- I've saved up a bit.

219
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,804
For your restaurant. Nangay told me.

220
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,326
I know you don't think much of me anymore.

221
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:17,846
I didn't want to hurt you.
Don't take it personally.

222
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,406
You don't want to marry me, Sandana.

223
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,409
That's personal.

224
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,010
Hello, Maravan.

225
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,209
Can I have a quick word?

226
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,491
I want you to cook the same meal again.

227
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,167
Not for me. For friends of mine.

228
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,161
A married couple.

229
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,490
They need help.

230
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,445
Support.

231
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,407
But the food has to be the same,
with the same effect.

232
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,404
Can you do that?

233
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,682
I don't have a rotary evaporator.
- I know. I have one.

234
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,808
They're marriage counsellors.

235
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:55,728
If your food works, they'll have
lots of patients you can cook for.

236
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,770
It's up ahead.

237
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,490
The pink one.

238
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,205
Need a hand?

239
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,289
No, thanks.
- Robert?

240
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,848
They're here.
- Come on. Let's just go and say hello.

241
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,529
Hello.
- Hello.

242
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,250
So. This is Maravan.
- Very well.

243
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,009
Andrea Peters.
- Robert.

244
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:57,968
Our practice is there, there's the kitchen
and I'll show you our little temple.

245
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,481
Upstairs is our private space.

246
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,404
Come with me.

247
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,126
Familiar with this?
- Me?

248
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,090
Yes, gas.

249
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,282
Oh, yes. That's the little temple
where we'll serve the meal.

250
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,562
It's lovely. Romantic.

251
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,970
Can I do anything? Anything you need?

252
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,402
No, we're all set.

253
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,806
Alright.

254
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,369
What do we always say to our patients?
- Just relax.

255
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,681
I'm relaxed.
If anyone here needs to relax, it's you.

256
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,802
I'm excited.
- But relaxed. - Yes.

257
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,165
Of course.

258
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,926
And if he cooks as good as he looks...

259
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,602
What are these?

260
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:11,326
Agar-agar with asparagus tips and beetroot.
But bigger.

261
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,048
That's no good.
- Why not? You said I should do the same...

262
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:19,928
You can't. They look like they're from
a tacky sex shop. Can we leave them out?

263
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,127
You ate it.

264
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,330
So...

265
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,166
chop off the balls.

266
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,691
I'll show you! I'll get you!

267
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,011
Be a good boy!

268
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,608
Who's the boss?

269
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,211
I'm gonna get you!

270
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,931
No!
- Come here.

271
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,364
Did it work?
- No.

272
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:16,162
Of course. Fifty-fifty business partnership.

273
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:23,208
Know what we can charge for your special menu?
Unbelievable!

274
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,971
They're getting naked. Want to see?

275
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,484
Thanks so much
It was wonderful, and tasted great.

276
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,884
Spread the word. OK.

277
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,121
Bye.

278
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,806
Saffron and curcuma.

279
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,004
Is that Japanese?

280
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,006
Chinese.

281
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,006
Nany.

282
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,800
Maravan?

283
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,844
Excuse me.
You can't discharge her, she's sick.

284
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,691
I can't keep her against her will.
Mrs Vilasam is refusing surgery.

285
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,201
But I can pay for the operation.

286
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:17,931
I can't operate on your grandmother
if she doesn't want me to.

287
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,407
But

288
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,841
she'll die.

289
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,811
I'm not going back!

290
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,327
Don't you shout at me.

291
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:57,242
It might be better if we stop shouting.
Especially you. - Speak our language.

292
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,324
She can't even speak our language.
- Get out.

293
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,763
Out of here. Everybody.

294
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,844
There's nothing else to say.

295
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:19,324
I don't want to go back to Sri Lanka.
- You should be happy to have a job.

296
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,246
I won't go back to become a waiter.

297
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,971
Nany...

298
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:46,082
I said you'll go back, and back you'll go.

299
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:50,405
He likes it here. He has friends.
Why can't you understand that?

300
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,845
Maravan.
- I can't stand it.

301
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:58,967
Talk to him. He won't listen to his uncle.
Maybe he'll listen to you.

302
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,490
Ulagu.

303
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,329
I'll pay for your language course,
driving license,

304
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,723
and I'll bring you back as soon as possible.

305
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,922
We're not just kitchen hands.

306
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,969
We're free people.

307
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,328
I'm not like you.

308
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,806
Here.

309
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,491
Sorry I'm late.
- No problem.

310
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,521
This is Maravan, the cook.
Makeda, "Lady of the House".

311
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,445
Cuba.

312
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,045
Sri Lanka.

313
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,929
How old is her husband?

314
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,565
Why?

315
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,163
She's so beautiful.

316
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:27,247
I can't imagine they'd have that sort of
marriage problem. Is he Cuban, too?

317
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:31,680
Andrea.

318
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,207
Andrea.

319
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,321
Hello, Isa.
- Where is he? - Who?

320
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,767
Don't deny it. His car's outside. Robert!

321
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:42,971
Robert isn't here, please. We want
an intimate atmosphere for your patients.

322
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:46,244
Patients. Is that a joke? Who's he here with?

323
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,890
Isa, Isa please.

324
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,447
Damn it, let me through.

325
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,971
Your dentist?
- It's an exercise, Isa.

326
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,043
An exercise? Whoremonger!

327
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,249
And you, black slut.

328
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,688
Enough. Don't be vulgar.
- Vulgar?

329
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:08,807
I was trying to deal with our marital crisis.
- Stop it.

330
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,488
No more clients. Forget about your "Love Food".

331
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,486
Isa, I'm sorry.

332
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:19,009
You should've thought of that earlier.
- Don't be hysterical. - Hysterical?

333
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:23,962
Shut you're trap, you dirty bastard.
- Don't be like that, Ina.

334
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,284
Have they left?

335
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:37,161
What are you doing?
- I'm done.

336
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,687
It's over.
- Wait a minute.

337
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,931
How embarrassing.

338
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,130
But what a meal.

339
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,566
What a cook.

340
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,246
That's what people eat in Sri Lanka?
- Yes.

341
00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:00,646
These dishes help unite desire and fulfillment
when man and woman are bound by love.

342
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,123
Right. It could make my job fun for once.

343
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:08,167
I have a lot of clients
who'd pay a fortune for that.

344
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,203
Especially when the starter gets them hard.

345
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,091
Listen.

346
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,969
Why don't we work together?
- Great.

347
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,369
This is indecent.
- That's why it pays so well.

348
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:27,241
Thanks for the offer. We'll... think it over.

349
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:31,486
You said they're all married.
- They are. Just not to me.

350
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,361
Let's talk about it later, OK?

351
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,441
It was my mistake, I apologize.

352
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:02,650
Just think of the money.
- All you Swiss ever think about is money.

353
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,764
What about your restaurant?
You need money.

354
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,410
I want 70% and you double the price.

355
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,927
60.
- 70.

356
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:29,567
So...

357
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,729
what are you doing tonight?

358
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:34,929
I don't know.

359
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:18,811
This here. I told you about that, right?

360
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,724
It's really good.

361
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,808
With coconut oil.
- Yeah? - And no artificial colouring.

362
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,486
Really?
- Yes. In two different sizes.

363
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,842
OK.
- But pay attention to...

364
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,404
Pay attention to...

365
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:36,324
Hello. You heard anything from Ulagu?

366
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,286
No.

367
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,490
This is good, too.

368
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,324
Me neither.

369
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,810
Does that surprise you?
Who sent him away?

370
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:50,404
The family wanted him to go back.
- And you do what the family tells you.

371
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,326
Children should obey their parents.
- Yeah?

372
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:59,209
Some do, anyway.

373
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,050
Should we go into town?
Got any plans? I still have time.

374
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,087
Like this.

375
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,011
Wait.

376
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:32,687
Like this.

377
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:47,600
We're hungry.

378
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:53,364
No, I counted them. Leave them alone.

379
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:55,324
One.
- No.

380
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:56,721
I counted them.

381
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,371
I'll have one.

382
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,609
Give them... Andrea.

383
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:03,886
Makeda, stop it.

384
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,409
Give them back, Andrea.

385
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,565
Makeda.

386
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:30,364
So...
I just wanted to make sure everything's ready.

387
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:35,001
These are my friends from Love Food.

388
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,766
Andrea Peters and our cook, Maravan.

389
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,321
The name's Dalmann, a pleasure.

390
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,122
Lovely. You've done good.

391
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,601
Recovered from the heart attack,
Mr Dalmann?

392
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:55,805
I used to wait tables at Huwyler's.
- Yeah, that was a close call.

393
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,804
"Dodged the grave-digger."

394
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:00,930
Well good luck with our Love Menu.

395
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,969
You wanna kill me?

396
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,931
I'll leave that to others for now.

397
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:17,362
I wouldn't bite into one of those.
- You don't have to.

398
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,648
Yes, others will.

399
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:28,607
Listen, Razziq wanted Michèle, have you...
- Just like you said.

400
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:29,926
Super.

401
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,770
That's them.

402
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,450
Hello, do come in.

403
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:48,846
The ladies will take a taxi, right?
Alright, see you all soon. Have fun, everyone.

404
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,803
You already know Michèle.

405
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,651
Right, Putschi?

406
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:28,049
A glass of water, please.
- Sparkling or still?

407
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,123
I don't know. Water.

408
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,525
Dalmann.

409
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,881
Who?

410
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,282
No, he won't write that.

411
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:50,006
They wouldn't dare publish that.

412
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:54,725
When I want to read about myself,
I'll let you know. Thanks.

413
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:40,291
What's that?
- Nothing dangerous.

414
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:43,564
Just comforting.

415
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:03,527
Were you ever in love?

416
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:06,846
And?

417
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,326
Her name's Sandana.

418
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,251
Sri Lanka?

419
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:22,004
Our families decided we should marry.

420
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,411
She didn't want me.

421
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,446
But you love her.

422
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:13,728
Maravan, Ulagu's disappeared.
- What?

423
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:19,211
His parents think he joined the Tigers.
They wouldn't tell my dad anything at the temple.

424
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:24,089
You cook mothagam for them, right?
- Yeah.

425
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:28,644
Think you could go to the temple and ask...?
- Yeah. This is for you.

426
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:31,770
Without raisins.

427
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:35,366
Without raisins. You remembered?

428
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:38,690
Yeah.
- Pantone without raisins. What a treat.

429
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,804
Thanks. I...

430
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,090
have to go.

431
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,925
Hello.

432
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:30,962
I have a question.
Remember Ulagu, Mahit's nephew?

433
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,724
They're saying---

434
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:37,370
he joined the Tigers.
- No one knows our fighters.

435
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:42,323
That's to protect our brave young heroes.

436
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:45,764
Don't ask such things.
- Of course not.

437
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,485
I just wanted to...

438
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:52,523
I want to support our valiant young Tigers
with a contribution.

439
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:55,121
We want to know if he's alright.

440
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,006
Fine.

441
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,931
What was the name?
- Ulagu Amar.

442
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,401
Thanks.

443
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,082
Thanks.

444
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:21,169
All I've done is take down the name. Alright?

445
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:48,209
For years, certain people have tried
to associate my name with illegal exports.

446
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:55,563
Arms exports? - Well, I find it regrettable that
Swiss television contributes to the speculation.

447
00:58:55,880 --> 00:59:00,966
So you support the public inquiry?
- Of course. That's a must.

448
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,170
Say that again.

449
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:07,326
Since when?

450
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:09,685
Are you sure?

451
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:13,360
What's wrong?

452
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:16,964
The M40's are on the water, but without shells.

453
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:19,367
Good, we still don't have a deal.

454
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:24,726
But the shells are on the ship with supplies
for the army. Cluster fuck. Sonofabitch.

455
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:28,771
What'll you tell Waen now? What'll you say?

456
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:32,329
Not a bloody thing.

457
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:36,844
Mr Kung Fu will sign the contract tonight
and all will be well.

458
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:38,047
Right, Putschi?

459
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:42,367
Look. Nice, eh?

460
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,041
We need drinks.

461
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,160
Hear me?

462
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,004
Clean this up.

463
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:58,641
If you don't buy, someone else will.

464
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:12,603
Richard, what's the trouble?

465
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:17,690
Richard,
I expect you to get your MPs under control.

466
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,367
So they vote down the inquiry.

467
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:24,403
Who? No surprise there. Who else?

468
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:27,049
Let's get started.

469
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:38,845
Has Dalmann gone?
- Yeah.

470
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:44,001
Who is that man? Is he from the Tamil Tigers?
- Mr Waen is from Thailand.

471
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:51,163
Two more champagnes, please.

472
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,204
What are you doing?

473
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,529
Are you nuts? Stop it.

474
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:40,481
Man!

475
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:38,004
I'll have one of those.
- It's with alcohol.

476
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:53,401
We're leaving.

477
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:59,282
Don't worry,
we won't ask you to come up to our room.

478
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:03,961
Everything OK?

479
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:08,449
Dalmann sells weapons to the Tamil Tigers.
- Oh, yeah?

480
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:12,969
If it's any consolation,
he also sells weapons to the army.

481
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:17,166
What army?
- Yours. Over there. In your country.

482
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:20,842
We really need some sleep.
- How do you know that?

483
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:25,444
I have eyes and ears, sweetheart.
- I'm glad you have eyes and ears.

484
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:36,446
Mint?

485
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:38,005
Mojito.

486
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:07,243
Last week's share and for shopping later.

487
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:11,726
Think you'll manage the shopping?

488
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:16,010
What's wrong?

489
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:20,521
Dalmann is an arms dealer.

490
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:29,244
He paid well.

491
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:37,481
Maravan, Ulagu wrote me a letter.

492
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:44,008
Can you translate it?

493
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:46,522
What are the Tamil Tigers?

494
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,001
It says:

495
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:50,487
And there?

496
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:54,611
"You'll be filled with pride.

497
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,969
The days of my people's enemies
are numbered.

498
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:02,251
I'll soon return as a hero

499
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,482
and hold you in my arms."

500
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:11,401
Someone wants to impress you.
- Think he'll be back? Soon?

501
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:47,051
Rathinam?

502
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:49,800
I'll let you know if I hear anything.

503
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:51,521
Ulagu wrote.

504
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:54,124
We'd like to speak with him.

505
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:58,042
I'll support the movement more in the future.

506
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:25,041
Are my parents here?

507
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:33,641
You're late.
- No, I'm not. You said 9:00 and it's 8:57.

508
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:35,490
She's always right.

509
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:40,605
I've made food. - Sure.
- No, thanks. We don't want any.

510
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:45,085
Vegetable fried rice with prawn chutney.
- We're not hungry.

511
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:47,727
How many times?
- I'd love some. Thanks.

512
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:51,120
Sandana, please.
- I've had nothing to eat.

513
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:58,085
It's ringing.

514
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:03,284
Is that him?

515
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:04,641
Yes.

516
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:07,360
Ulagu.

517
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:10,491
Ulagu. Can you hear me?

518
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,161
Ulagu,

519
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:15,887
I'm pleased to see you.

520
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:18,120
Are you alright?

521
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:21,969
Your aunt and uncle are here.

522
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,970
Ulagu, where are you anyway?
- Ulagu.

523
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,804
You can't ask that.

524
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,651
He can't say where he is.
- Ulagu,

525
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:40,651
you must go home to your parents.

526
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:43,127
They're so worried.

527
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:47,411
Your mother is crying her eyes out.
This is no way to behave.

528
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,606
Ulagu.
- Ulagu, come back.

529
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:55,162
We just want to chat.
- What's with his leg? - What's wrong?

530
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,442
Ulagu!
- Why's he limping?

531
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,286
Aninda...

532
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:08,445
Would you like a tea? A calming one?

533
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:10,808
It's all your fault.
- Aninda!

534
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:14,203
Ridiculous, Mama.
- Don't talk to her that way.

535
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:17,524
We should've never
gotten mixed up with his family.

536
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:20,001
Sandana, come on, we're leaving.
- No.

537
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:24,682
Aninda, wait a minute.
- This is your daughter.

538
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:38,051
Oh, dear. Sorry.
How about your prawn chutney?

539
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:49,325
My mother also believes that Nangay's chicken
soup saved her eldest brother.

540
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:55,801
Chicken soup is good for a lot,
but not snake bites.

541
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:59,761
Unless you hit the snake
with the chicken beforehand.

542
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:07,724
What do you use that for?
- What?

543
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:10,085
That machine.

544
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:13,806
For...

545
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:15,730
transformation.

546
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:30,806
They say that Nangay
taught you how to cook food that...

547
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:34,324
food that...

548
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:36,806
for passion.

549
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:40,886
Is it possible?

550
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:48,400
And how...? How...? How does it work?

551
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,245
It just works.

552
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:58,568
Nangay, for example,

553
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:02,646
transformed rice,
lentils and coconut into dough,

554
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:05,601
and the dough into little balls.

555
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:11,046
And using milk, sugar and steam,
she transformed the balls into fake figs.

556
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,286
Cooking is transformation.

557
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:15,971
Cold into warm,

558
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:17,850
sour into sweet,

559
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:20,010
soft into hard...

560
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:22,491
And...

561
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:25,651
does the food transform people, too?

562
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:29,405
To some extent.

563
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,082
Can I sleep here tonight?

564
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:56,085
No, not like that.
I just can't stand my parents right now.

565
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:59,205
Sure.

566
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:18,086
Thanks.

567
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:20,802
Oh, the lamps. Sorry.

568
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:26,209
I'll turn them off.
- They don't bother me.

569
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,890
Now it's... nighttime for the curry trees, too.

570
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:26,167
Hello. Traffic was terrible.
All this goes in the car? - Yes.

571
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:28,204
Anything else?
- It's all in the kitchen.

572
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,201
This?

573
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:32,084
And, um...

574
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:36,360
Hello.

575
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:43,322
Andrea

576
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:47,050
We... work together. Sandana.

577
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:52,964
You go ahead.

578
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:56,169
I'll be right there.

579
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:02,163
Nice to meet you.

580
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:08,006
So that was Sandana? And?

581
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,082
Did you sleep with each other?

582
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:13,010
Why not?

583
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,367
Oh, that'd be improper, right?

584
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:19,647
You like the new car? Enough space now?

585
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:24,087
You don't know anything about Tamil women.
- You don't know anything about women.

586
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:29,130
She just doesn't want her parents
to choose her husband. - I know.

587
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:32,284
Good, because I invited her for dinner.

588
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:34,170
You can come too.

589
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:35,367
When?

590
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:33,161
That's 24,000 francs.
I want Ulagu sent back home.

591
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:01,127
I see.

592
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:07,764
So how much money are we talking about?

593
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:09,121
Tell her.

594
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:15,568
She really wants to know exactly.

595
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:20,763
5,785,000.

596
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:25,160
What if something happens to me
on my way to the bank?

597
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:29,369
They'll bring the money to the bank
and you'll deposit it.

598
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:35,161
She'll need a visa for Sri Lanka.
- Sure.

599
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:38,170
I could tag on a week of holiday
and take a friend.

600
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:40,406
Why not?

601
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:43,041
It would be less obvious that way.

602
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:45,241
No?

603
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:05,731
The whore'll screw you over.
- Don't call her a whore, it sounds so ugly.

604
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:09,209
What should I call her?
- Do you want to go?

605
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:10,961
See?

606
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:16,291
The shells won't dock
before I'm 100% sure the money's there.

607
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:21,965
And if she gets out of line, she'll be rolling
Havanas before you've finished dessert.

608
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,609
And she knows it.

609
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:48,251
You could've told me straight away.
But he only just told me yesterday.

610
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:51,364
That pig does what he wants with you.
- That's none of your business.

611
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:54,251
He sends you off on a whim.
Can't he open his own account?

612
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:57,404
His doctor won't let him fly.
Our guests are here.

613
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:59,768
Hello Maravan. Hello, I'm Makeda.

614
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:01,127
For you.
- Thanks.

615
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:02,886
Sorry.

616
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:06,164
We won't be going away.
Dalmann wants her to fly right back,

617
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:10,769
and she's such a good girl,
she does whatever he wants. - Andrea, please.

618
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:14,249
What do you want to drink?
White wine, Sandana?

619
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:18,124
Water, please.
- Sure? Wouldn't you prefer a tea?

620
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:21,403
Tea is good.
- I thought you were going to Sri Lanka.

621
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:26,009
I thought so too, but she'd rather do business
with the arms dealer.

622
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:28,804
What sort of business?

623
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:30,445
This way.

624
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:34,842
I'll warn you up front:
I'm not as good a cook as Maravan.

625
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:38,482
I hope you like it anyway.
- What does he pay you? Do tell.

626
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:43,571
What does he pay you? And who does the cooking?
- That's different.

627
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:47,731
Oh, cooking for him is alright?
- At least I don't fuck him.

628
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:51,290
Shut your face.

629
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:53,920
Sorry.

630
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:58,567
I'd like to go. Now.

631
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:03,483
Good of you to come.

632
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:31,405
So...

633
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:35,207
this Dalmann sells weapons
to the Tamil Tigers?

634
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:45,724
Your parents were killed in the war

635
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:48,361
and you cook for him?

636
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:59,771
Does Nangay know what you do with her recipes?

637
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:10,483
I'm getting out here.

638
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:15,922
I'll stay at a girlfriend's.

639
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:17,361
Take care

640
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:20,850
Good night.

641
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:53,491
Who died?

642
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:57,964
I don't know. It's coming from Mahit's place.

643
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:33,247
Sandana.
- Let me go.

644
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:35,370
Sandana.

645
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:36,925
Stop it.

646
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:40,569
He was shot.

647
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:19,245
They...

648
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:22,205
broke into an army munitions depot.

649
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:26,360
And were caught in the act.

650
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:30,931
I'm sorry.

651
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:37,565
But you won't bring him
back to life by not cooking,

652
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:41,762
I did something wrong to earn money.

653
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:45,483
And you think that's why Ulagu was killed?

654
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:47,922
Because of your Love Menus?

655
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:53,565
You didn't force him to join the Tigers.

656
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,525
How old was he?

657
01:25:58,120 --> 01:25:59,167
Hello.

658
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:07,364
You didn't shoot him.
- You don't understand.

659
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:10,720
12,000 for the rotary evaporator.

660
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:15,802
The new car, the advertising.
We have eleven bookings in Basel.

661
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:18,247
We don't have to stay. Fuck Zurich.

662
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:22,841
We can start up something in Berlin.

663
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:25,209
What's going on?

664
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:28,647
He wants to stop cooking.

665
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:31,491
Too bad. Dalmann wants a love menu.

666
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:36,084
His doctor says his blood pressure's OK
and he wants to screw again.

667
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:39,730
Don't worry, there won't be much action.

668
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:44,528
I don't care. I don't want to hear about it.
Do what you think is right, OK?

669
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:47,081
I'm flying the day after tomorrow.

670
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:51,731
Why the hurry?
- Some ship can't be unloaded otherwise.

671
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:55,643
I don't know.
- You're flying to Colombo for Dalmann?

672
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,970
And are you coming over to mine or what?

673
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:05,285
Dalmann will get his Love Menu.
- You don't have to. It won't help anyway.

674
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:09,007
Yes, it will, but before you fly to Colombo.
I'll do it.

675
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:11,164
He has no time.

676
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:12,760
Call him.

677
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:14,682
Call him!

678
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:30,720
And Basel?

679
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:41,802
Hi, darling. It's me.

680
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:43,521
Are you busy?

681
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:43,527
Can I come in?
- Yeah.

682
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:47,282
A man from the temple came to see us.

683
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:53,851
They didn't want us to get the wrong impression.
They wanted to share our grief.

684
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:56,606
Sorry.

685
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:02,844
They suspect that you banged up that car.

686
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:07,167
I said I didn't believe you could do that.
- Hello?

687
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:15,881
I've got the Campari. Dalmann wanted
champagne, right? Do we have enough?

688
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:18,128
Three bottles...

689
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:21,171
are left.
- Oh yeah, that's plenty.

690
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:30,606
Sorry about the other night. We feel
really bad about it, I hope Maravan told you.

691
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:37,843
I didn't mean to interrupt.
I'll get the fish. Need anything else?

692
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:41,803
I have everything, thanks.
- OK, fine. See you.

693
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,408
You're cooking for Dalmann?

694
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:56,166
Why?

695
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:00,448
Why?
- I have to.

696
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:13,931
You think you can transform him?

697
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,729
What are you making?

698
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:12,770
A cocktail. Campari balls with...

699
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:14,406
"quid ginger.

700
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:27,444
Very interesting.

701
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,809
Never seen this before.

702
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:33,322
He can really cook, that Indian.

703
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:35,964
Where did he pick it up?

704
01:31:36,160 --> 01:31:39,801
I don't know,
it's called something like "Man and Woman."

705
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:43,880
What's his name again?
- Maravan.

706
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:45,844
Maravan.
- Any more?

707
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:53,081
Later.

708
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:01,761
Eat.

709
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:14,601
Open wide.

710
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:22,246
Careful.

711
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:26,041
Let me. I'll do that.

712
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:55,090
The drinks.

713
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:59,890
Campari caviare on chilled champagne
with glazed slices of navel orange.

714
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:02,688
Red... for the lady.

715
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:20,045
What are you staring at?

716
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:22,405
Come on.

717
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:10,960
What's up?

718
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:15,323
Want to go home? I can do the rest.

719
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:17,050
No!

720
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:48,010
Darling, it's not working. Don't be sad.

721
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:51,642
Fuck, be creative. I need it so bad.

722
01:34:58,680 --> 01:35:01,160
How much do I need to eat for it to work?

723
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:04,448
I couldn't say, Mr Dalmann.

724
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:09,801
Come here. Do it to her.

725
01:35:10,360 --> 01:35:13,250
How much do you want? I'll pay.
- Please stop.

726
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:15,010
Come here.
- No.

727
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:19,842
You think I don't know what you two are up to?
Come on. Don't be like that.

728
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:25,364
You're being impossible!
- I want to see you two get it on.

729
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:33,561
Get undressed.
- Stop it.

730
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:35,285
Undress.
- No!

731
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:37,648
Stop. What are you doing?

732
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:39,851
Let her go.

733
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:43,165
Think I don't know what you are, huh?

734
01:35:44,440 --> 01:35:47,887
Kiss her. I said kiss. Come on, kiss.

735
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:49,286
Stop it.

736
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:52,324
Leave them alone.

737
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,241
Can I see?
- Leave me alone. No.

738
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:03,045
Fucking Indian.

739
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:05,811
Fucking Indian.

740
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:11,204
He just made... a big mistake.

741
01:36:12,520 --> 01:36:14,010
The curry-eater.

742
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:17,166
A shame. A real shame.

743
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:21,166
I would've been glad to help you
the way you cook.

744
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:23,570
Ingenious but now...

745
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:27,287
I'll finish you.
- Come down, what's got into you?

746
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:29,882
I need a whisky.
- No whisky. Water.

747
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:31,241
I want whisky.

748
01:36:34,120 --> 01:36:35,884
Now go, get out.

749
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:38,120
Get out.

750
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:39,811
Go!

751
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:42,329
I'll take care of this.

752
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:48,687
Darling, you're being impossible, know that?

753
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:10,646
No.

754
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:13,248
Yes.
- Please call me back, OK?

755
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,321
I can't get through to his doctor.
What can I do?

756
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:18,209
I think he's dying.

757
01:37:22,120 --> 01:37:23,610
Andrea,

758
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:26,366
what's the matter? Why are you crying?

759
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:30,844
Come on, what is it?

760
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:33,331
Everything's OK.

761
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:02,808
Andrea. He's here.

762
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:04,689
At the staircase.

763
01:38:15,320 --> 01:38:17,209
Shit, I...

764
01:38:51,640 --> 01:38:54,803
Makeda flew to Colombo
the next day as planned.

765
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:57,008
She accepted the money
and transferred it to Macau

766
01:38:57,080 --> 01:38:58,923
where Andrea was waiting for her.

767
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:02,800
When I received the cheque,
I knew they had made it.

768
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:13,809
As far as I know,

769
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:16,645
the weapons on the ship
never made it ashore.

770
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:18,842
At least not in Sri Lanka.

771
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:01,407
Nangay died two months later.

772
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:16,807
I don't know if what I did

773
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:19,360
brought some justice to the world.

774
01:40:21,080 --> 01:40:24,129
Maybe just for a brief, insignificant moment.

775
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:27,644
At least I tried.

776
01:40:41,080 --> 01:40:43,287
I had inherited Nangay's knowledge,

777
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:45,249
but not her wisdom.

778
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,685
A cook can transform cold into warm,

779
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:01,205
hard into soft,

780
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:02,805
sour into sweet...

781
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:08,327
But he can't turn evil into good.
