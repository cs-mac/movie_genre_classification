'the close to 35 years as the only static member of a band called Motorhead.' 

18
00:01:32,313 --> 00:01:36,840
The image of him holding that Rickenbacker bass is enough to put shivers up my spine. 

19
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,241
I am, of course, talking about the man sitting right next to me, musical icon, Lemmy. 

20
00:01:41,241 --> 00:01:43,631
You romantic fool!

The man is the modern Jesus. 

23
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:58,553
To be honest, he is fucking Jesus Christ. 

24
00:01:58,553 --> 00:01:59,977
Motorhead is my life. 

25
00:01:59,977 --> 00:02:03,540
Without Lemmy, there would be no Metallica, no Megadeth, no Slayer. 

26
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,139
There wouldn't be any of today's heavy metal. 

27
00:02:06,139 --> 00:02:08,696
Rock'n'roll IS Lemmy, Lemmy IS rock'n'roll. 

28
00:02:08,696 --> 00:02:10,918

# All I want is your special care. #

00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:18,924
If I hear Motorhead, I will bang for the whole time.

00:02:21,732 --> 00:02:23,576
Lemmy is God. 

33
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:26,888
If they drop a nuclear bomb on this planet, 

34
00:02:26,888 --> 00:02:30,199
Lemmy and cockroaches is all that is going to survive.

# Hey, babe, wait a minute stop. #

00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:48,977
Everybody, it's Loveline. Lemmy from Motorhead in the house. 

38
00:02:48,977 --> 00:02:51,366
- Mike Catherwood, paying homage. 
- You know it. 

39
00:02:51,366 --> 00:02:56,522
The current CD is called Motoriser, the 24th CD from Motorhead. 

40
00:02:56,522 --> 00:02:58,954
- Amazing. 
- Yes, it amazed me all right. 

41
00:02:58,954 --> 00:03:03,984
35 years ago, when you were getting the band started, did you think you would be 25 albums in? 

42
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:06,708
You don't think like that. You think, two years. 

43
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:10,313
You just want to play with a couple of guys, that is all it is. 

44
00:03:10,313 --> 00:03:13,624
- And then it goes on, and on. 
- And on! 

45
00:03:13,624 --> 00:03:19,408
- Is it true that over 2,000 women you've bedded? 
- No, the magazine printed that. I said a thousand. 

46
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:24,731
- Yeah. That's still pretty impressive. 
- Not really, I've never been married and I'm 63. 

47
00:03:24,731 --> 00:03:27,205
Work it out, it's not many a year. 

48
00:03:27,205 --> 00:03:29,469
- Wow. 
- I like how he thinks. 

49
00:03:29,469 --> 00:03:32,696
Let's go to calls. Jason is calling from Canada. 

50
00:03:32,696 --> 00:03:36,092
'Lemmy, it is an honour to be talking to you. A true legend. 

51
00:03:36,092 --> 00:03:38,731
'Two quick questions for you. 

52
00:03:38,731 --> 00:03:43,175
'Basically, I would like to know what are your musical influences today? 

53
00:03:43,175 --> 00:03:45,648
'And your favourite place to play a gig.' 

54
00:03:45,648 --> 00:03:49,168
I don't really mind where we play, as long as they go "Hooray". 

55
00:03:49,168 --> 00:03:54,073
- 'I think it's cool you're still rocking today. Keep up the good work.' 
- I will. 

56
00:03:54,073 --> 00:03:58,390
Don't forget, I'm not qualified to do anything else! 

57
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:02,455
- 'The other question was, what are your musical...' 
- Influences, yes. 

58
00:04:02,455 --> 00:04:04,049
He anticipates that one! 

59
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:08,449
Your influences are the same when you're my age as when you were 20. 

60
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:12,137
The first things you hear that really knock you out stick with you. 

61
00:04:12,137 --> 00:04:15,240
You're never going to hear any music better than that. 

62
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,551
So it was Little Richard, the Beatles, Elvis, you know. 

63
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:20,480
I like good old stuff, you know. 

64
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,701
Where were you when you heard that stuff? 

65
00:04:22,701 --> 00:04:25,970
The first time I saw the Beatles, they hadn't made a record yet. 

66
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:29,617
- You saw them? 
- Yes, at the Cavern in Liverpool. 
- What was that like? 

67
00:04:29,617 --> 00:04:32,383
It was magic. They WERE magic, you know. 

68
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:38,000
- Did you think, "This is going to be the greatest rock band of all time"? 
- Yes. Kind of, I did. 

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,354
We used to get these girls would come down... 

70
00:04:41,354 --> 00:04:44,581
I lived in a holiday resort place in North Wales. 

71
00:04:44,581 --> 00:04:46,970
These girls from Liverpool would come down. 

72
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:51,287
And every year, there was this singer called Billy Fury, they were crazy about him. 

73
00:04:51,287 --> 00:04:53,634
And then one year, it had all changed. 

74
00:04:53,634 --> 00:04:55,562
It was this Beatles thing, you know. 

75
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:59,084
So we would hitch-hike up to Liverpool, see what they were like. 

76
00:04:59,084 --> 00:05:01,599
They were monstrous, like, perfect, you know. 

77
00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:06,629
People think the Stones were the hard men and the Beatles the sissies, and it's the opposite. 

78
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:11,114
The Beatles were from Liverpool and the Stones were from the London suburbs, you know. 

79
00:05:11,114 --> 00:05:14,760
Going to art school and shit. It wasn't that way at all. 

80
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,114
The Beatles, I always thought, were the best band in the world. 

81
00:05:23,101 --> 00:05:25,615
- No, we don't. 
- I knew you were going to say that!

89
00:06:12,436 --> 00:06:13,862
Yes. 

90
00:06:15,832 --> 00:06:19,478
- Where's the lady who gave me her copy? 
- I'll bring her over. 

91
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:26,981
I was like, all right, I've got to give it to him, in the name of rock and roll. 

92
00:06:26,981 --> 00:06:29,748
And it sounds great. I think you'll really like it. 

93
00:06:31,173 --> 00:06:32,807
Yes, the original... 

94
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:37,880
A couple of them are like, I mean... Sgt Pepper sounds amazing. 

95
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,149

- Thanks very much.

# Dance to the American beat. # 

101
00:06:56,867 --> 00:07:00,975
The Sunset Strip has seen a whole lot of different movements and genres 

102
00:07:00,975 --> 00:07:03,951
and musical versions of the same thing, basically. 

103
00:07:03,951 --> 00:07:08,646
We had a bunch of different musical movements and, first of all, 

104
00:07:08,646 --> 00:07:11,872
Motorhead is one of those bands that transcends movements. 

105
00:07:11,872 --> 00:07:16,149
It doesn't matter what's happening in the community, in the rock culture, 

106
00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:21,052
Motorhead is still hailed as being, like, king. 

107
00:07:21,052 --> 00:07:26,208
When he moved to LA, became part of the scene, he was already embraced. 

108
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:28,555
Basically, his throne was waiting for him. 

109
00:07:28,555 --> 00:07:30,986
Two cameras, A mark. 

110
00:07:32,998 --> 00:07:34,172
And mark. 

111
00:07:34,172 --> 00:07:36,352
Action. 

112
00:07:36,352 --> 00:07:40,082
Lem, there's somebody I want you to meet. Hank, the writer. 

113
00:07:40,082 --> 00:07:43,562
Obviously, he's not from LA, but it is really interesting to see 

114
00:07:43,562 --> 00:07:47,124
how much of a staple Lemmy has become, especially in Hollywood. 

115
00:07:47,124 --> 00:07:50,520
He has become a Los Angeles icon, you know. 

116
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,454
- Cut. 
- I don't know if he does fit in in LA. 

117
00:07:53,454 --> 00:07:55,883
LA is so fucked up, 

118
00:07:55,883 --> 00:07:57,729
he doesn't really fit. 

119
00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:00,034
I think Hollywood has to fit him. 

120
00:08:00,034 --> 00:08:04,268
All we have to do now is do that another 147 times and we're there. 

121
00:08:04,268 --> 00:08:05,860
A lot of people are LA bashers. 

122
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,841
Especially people from up north in San Francisco, that kind of thing. 

123
00:08:09,841 --> 00:08:13,028
That is LA, La-La Land, or whatever they call it. 

124
00:08:13,028 --> 00:08:16,925
You know, it is just a land of pretentious people, 

125
00:08:16,925 --> 00:08:18,351
all that kind of thing. 

126
00:08:18,351 --> 00:08:21,914
There is a real weight to this town, there is a real history to it. 

127
00:08:21,914 --> 00:08:25,562
I think it has got a lot more balls than a lot of big cities, frankly. 

128
00:08:25,562 --> 00:08:30,298
'Lemmy looks like an LA rocker to me. 

129
00:08:30,298 --> 00:08:32,979
'He has got that thing about him. 

130
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:37,214
'He is combination biker, musician,' 

131
00:08:37,214 --> 00:08:40,860
or guy that works at the car wash. 

132
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,249
He's got that old school LA look. 

133
00:08:43,249 --> 00:08:46,225
'He doesn't change it and I don't think' 

134
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:47,986
it was created. 

135
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:50,543
And that is what the good part of LA is, it is 

136
00:08:50,543 --> 00:08:52,470
the people who don't try to be. 

137
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:56,998
I was in bands when I was a little kid. I came to California to do that. 

138
00:08:56,998 --> 00:09:00,979
I got out here and this guy I knew wanted me to go for an acting part. 

139
00:09:00,979 --> 00:09:03,620
I got that and the next thing you know, 

140
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,974
I was in some theatre group and I didn't know anything about it. 

141
00:09:06,974 --> 00:09:10,285
I realised I was making a little bit of money doing this acting. 

142
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:14,812
I do, too. 

143
00:09:21,099 --> 00:09:24,243
I doubt we'll get it in this day and time. 

144
00:09:24,243 --> 00:09:28,309
I always figured, my music is very popular, I must be doing something wrong! 

145
00:09:33,422 --> 00:09:35,644
Yes, me too. I grew up with that. 

146
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,722
Oh, it's great. 

147
00:09:44,739 --> 00:09:45,914
Oh, I'm telling you. 

148
00:09:48,932 --> 00:09:50,021
Oh, yeah. 

149
00:09:57,985 --> 00:10:01,003
I worked with him one time on a TV show, he was there. 

150
00:10:01,003 --> 00:10:02,890
And he pulls up in an old Cadillac 

151
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:06,619
and all of these guys get out in suits and everything. 

152
00:10:08,673 --> 00:10:10,727
He met my son. 

153
00:10:10,727 --> 00:10:15,128
My son at the time was only like three or four. 

154
00:10:15,128 --> 00:10:17,266
Little Richard goes, "Hey, baby!" 

155
00:10:17,266 --> 00:10:22,212
I go to my kid, I say, "Hey, Willie, it's OK to talk to this cat, 

156
00:10:22,212 --> 00:10:24,014
"but don't sit on his lap." 

157
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:26,822
'Lemmy is like' 

158
00:10:26,822 --> 00:10:28,751
a fucking radioactive cowboy. 

159
00:10:28,751 --> 00:10:31,560
- A hard rock Johnny Cash. 
- A biker. 

160
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,487
World War Two chic. 

161
00:10:33,487 --> 00:10:36,715
- He's Black Bart meets Mad Max. 
- He's Captain Hook. 

162
00:10:36,715 --> 00:10:39,063
A little bit of cowboy, a little bit of metal. 

163
00:10:39,063 --> 00:10:40,529
Little bit of rock'n'roll. 

164
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:43,673
He'd be the perfect description of my dream dude, for sure. 

165
00:10:43,673 --> 00:10:47,487
Lemmy's look is something that is probably a little bit 

166
00:10:47,487 --> 00:10:49,542
cultivated from back in the fifties. 

167
00:10:49,542 --> 00:10:51,176
And then added to that, 

168
00:10:51,176 --> 00:10:52,936
some of the shit that he picked up 

169
00:10:52,936 --> 00:10:56,290
along the way... bikers, punk rock, whatever. 

170
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:58,553
Although he has been around for a long time, 

171
00:10:58,553 --> 00:11:01,948
so maybe some of the punk stuff, they got it from him. 

172
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:19,344
Describing Lemmy's style is not that easy, 

173
00:11:19,344 --> 00:11:24,499
because from boot to boot, it always changes substantially. 

174
00:11:24,499 --> 00:11:28,021
# Let me tell you, babe 

175
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,786
# What I say is right... # 

176
00:11:30,786 --> 00:11:34,308
He's got a very distinctive and good aesthetic sense. 

177
00:11:34,308 --> 00:11:37,786
He actually will bring me drawings of what he wants. 

178
00:11:37,786 --> 00:11:40,301
# You've got me crazy... # 

179
00:11:40,301 --> 00:11:43,906
If I was to really give it a specific name, 

180
00:11:43,906 --> 00:11:47,050
I would probably say it is like a Western jackboot. 

181
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:50,445
He likes these boots with a squared-off nose, 

182
00:11:50,445 --> 00:11:52,205
almost military looking. 

183
00:11:52,205 --> 00:11:54,468
Almost like a cavalry kind of boot 

184
00:11:54,468 --> 00:11:58,031
with Motorhead flair to it, of course. 

185
00:11:58,031 --> 00:12:00,044
# What I say is true... # 

186
00:12:00,044 --> 00:12:03,815
We were at a rehearsal place in the Valleys back in the mid-nineties 

187
00:12:03,815 --> 00:12:07,002
and Motorhead was right next to us, rehearsing for a tour. 

188
00:12:07,002 --> 00:12:10,774
Every day, we would see Lemmy out at this video game in the lobby area. 

189
00:12:10,774 --> 00:12:13,625
It was summertime, it was really hot in the Valley, 

190
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:16,013
and Lemmy was wearing shorts. 

191
00:12:16,013 --> 00:12:18,318
Now if I tell you, he's wearing Daisy Dukes. 

192
00:12:18,318 --> 00:12:20,121
It was like a thong, dude. 

193
00:12:20,121 --> 00:12:21,798
You would walk out of our door 

194
00:12:21,798 --> 00:12:25,234
and the first thing you would see when you walked out of our room 

195
00:12:25,234 --> 00:12:27,414
was Lemmy bent over this machine. 

196
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:31,899
So it's basically Lemmy bending over with his ass in your face. 

197
00:12:33,409 --> 00:12:34,876
That's a weird scene. 

198
00:12:34,876 --> 00:12:38,354
And we're all wearing shorts, but our shorts are board shorts. 

199
00:12:38,354 --> 00:12:41,037
Finally, you know, I got the balls to walk up to him. 

200
00:12:41,037 --> 00:12:44,768
He's playing the game. I was like, "Hey, man." 

201
00:12:44,768 --> 00:12:46,738
He's like, "Hey, Scott, how are you?" 

202
00:12:46,738 --> 00:12:49,630
I'm like, "We've all been wondering." "What's that?" 

203
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:54,617
I said, "What's the deal with the shorts? Like, seriously?" 

204
00:12:54,617 --> 00:12:59,187
And I'm thinking, I'm afraid is he going to punch me, what's going to happen? 

205
00:12:59,187 --> 00:13:01,617
He's like, "What? What do you mean?" 

206
00:13:01,617 --> 00:13:04,258
And I said, "They're really short. 

207
00:13:04,258 --> 00:13:07,444
"We see your ass every day, it's kind of weird." 

208
00:13:07,444 --> 00:13:10,127
He goes, "What? It's hot out. These are shorts." 

209
00:13:10,127 --> 00:13:12,642
And he kind of steps back and looks at me and goes, 

210
00:13:12,642 --> 00:13:16,415
"Those aren't shorts. Those are pants. These are shorts. I'm cool." 

211
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:19,433
And he kind of goes like this, like... 

212
00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:21,821
Like it made absolute sense. 

213
00:13:21,821 --> 00:13:24,001
# So bad baby I don't care. # 

214
00:13:30,792 --> 00:13:33,893
What anyone thinks, what anyone cares, it doesn't matter. 

215
00:13:33,893 --> 00:13:37,415
He's just Lemmy, you either take him or you fucking don't. 

216
00:13:37,415 --> 00:13:40,096
He doesn't give a flying shit whether you do or not. 

217
00:13:40,096 --> 00:13:42,024
There are no words. 

218
00:13:42,024 --> 00:13:45,043
He's Lemmy. It's almost... 

219
00:13:45,043 --> 00:13:46,719
It should be a verb. 

220
00:13:49,611 --> 00:13:51,246
Nobody told him to do 

221
00:13:51,246 --> 00:13:55,061
anything that he wasn't completely natural and comfortable doing. 

222
00:13:55,061 --> 00:13:56,192
And that's rare. 

223
00:13:56,192 --> 00:13:59,586
And that's why I think we respond with respect. 

224
00:13:59,586 --> 00:14:03,024
Because we want to be like that. 

225
00:14:03,024 --> 00:14:04,575
I think he is a renegade. 

226
00:14:04,575 --> 00:14:07,929
There's not that many of them any more. Everybody assimilates. 

227
00:14:07,929 --> 00:14:14,048
You know, go along to get along. To get what they need to get. 

228
00:14:14,048 --> 00:14:17,737
And I don't see Lemmy as that kind of guy. 

229
00:14:17,737 --> 00:14:22,307
I see Lemmy as doing things his way to get where he wants to go. 

230
00:14:22,307 --> 00:14:26,666
And that's attractive, because people don't do that any more. 

231
00:14:36,431 --> 00:14:40,162
# When you move in right up close to me 

232
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:48,209
# That's when I get the shakes all over me. # 

233
00:14:51,353 --> 00:14:57,473
The thing I remember about Lemmy, which has nothing to do with music, 

234
00:14:57,473 --> 00:15:01,330
is that he was obsessed, and I think he still is, with one-armed bandits. 

235
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:03,551
You know, the... 

236
00:15:03,551 --> 00:15:05,395
And I can remember 

237
00:15:05,395 --> 00:15:10,593
Dingwalls, the little club in London, very popular, by the canal. 

238
00:15:10,593 --> 00:15:13,442
I think that's probably the first time I ever met him. 

239
00:15:13,442 --> 00:15:17,970
You walked into Dingwalls and just inside was the one-armed bandit 

240
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:20,861
and, without fail, he would be on that. 

241
00:15:20,861 --> 00:15:22,581
Sometimes all night. 

242
00:15:22,581 --> 00:15:25,809
I don't know if he ever won, but he would play it for hours. 

243
00:15:26,981 --> 00:15:29,874
I've never seen anybody love those things so much. 

244
00:15:29,874 --> 00:15:33,395
They should bring out a Motorhead one-armed bandit. 

245
00:15:33,395 --> 00:15:36,748
And if you get three Lemmies, you win the jackpot. 

246
00:15:36,748 --> 00:15:38,383
# Shaking all over... # 

247
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:54,102
When it comes to rock'n'roll, you need something to believe in, 

248
00:15:54,102 --> 00:15:55,442
you know? 

249
00:15:55,442 --> 00:15:57,999
Integrity means everything. 

250
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:01,227
Musically, of course, when you go and see a band 

251
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:04,748
and you know it's coming from the heart, it touches you even more 

252
00:16:04,748 --> 00:16:07,347
because there's some sort of human connection. 

253
00:16:07,347 --> 00:16:10,322
If you go up and see some robots moving around the stage, 

254
00:16:10,322 --> 00:16:13,425
you might as well go home and play video games. 

255
00:16:13,425 --> 00:16:20,173
But when someone is doing... when someone's playing rock and roll from the heart 

256
00:16:20,173 --> 00:16:25,538
and they really walk it like they talk it, you pay more attention, 

257
00:16:25,538 --> 00:16:30,442
because it makes you feel like a human being, in a way. 

258
00:16:30,442 --> 00:16:37,316
Like, to connect to someone doing something really honest or really true, 

259
00:16:37,316 --> 00:16:40,501
it's important. 

260
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:44,400
And so, to me, more than any other rock musician... 

261
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,376
I consider Lemmy a legend, you know, 

262
00:16:47,376 --> 00:16:51,693
but to me, more than any other rock musician, 

263
00:16:51,693 --> 00:16:56,346
he is the baddest motherfucker in the world. 

264
00:17:00,118 --> 00:17:02,340
HE PLAYS BASS DRUM 

265
00:17:04,101 --> 00:17:05,735
DRUM RIFF STARTS 

266
00:17:14,203 --> 00:17:15,753
You know what would be cool? 

267
00:17:15,753 --> 00:17:17,850
If I could get one of those lyric sheets? 

268
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:21,747
When it gets to the instrumentals, there's two 12 bars in a row, OK? 

269
00:17:23,717 --> 00:17:25,435
Let's just check the levels here 

270
00:17:25,435 --> 00:17:28,244
with Lemmy, make sure he can hear himself. 

271
00:17:28,244 --> 00:17:30,255
BASS GUITAR 

272
00:17:30,255 --> 00:17:32,017
HE PLAYS A RIFF 

273
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:34,406
BASS DROWNS VOICES IN BACKGROUND 

274
00:18:27,723 --> 00:18:30,656
That one little spot where it's on the double chorus... 

275
00:18:30,656 --> 00:18:34,597
- Yeah, it's a double chorus, you know? Fuck! 
- For Christ's sake. 

276
00:18:34,597 --> 00:18:36,483
What was Chuck Berry thinking? 

277
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:40,339
I remember a show in England that I did with Meat Loaf, where the whole show 

278
00:18:40,339 --> 00:18:45,579
was held up because Chuck Berry thought he hadn't been paid when his agent had been paid, 

279
00:18:45,579 --> 00:18:48,010
and wouldn't go on until he had a wad of money. 

280
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:50,399
He had been fucked so many times, you know? 

281
00:18:50,399 --> 00:18:52,746
In the '50s, there were no rules at all. 

282
00:18:52,746 --> 00:18:56,518
A guy could pull a gun and say, "I'm not paying you, what you going to do?" 

283
00:18:56,518 --> 00:18:59,411
Even in the '60s and late '60s, 

284
00:18:59,411 --> 00:19:01,800
Hendrix got burned fucking blind, you know. 

285
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,777
He never saw any of the money. 

286
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:07,877
I was outside LAX once, getting ready to get on a plane. 

287
00:19:07,877 --> 00:19:13,285
And this young black guy comes up to me and says, "Hey, I read in an interview that the only person 

288
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:16,387
"you ever want to meet is Little Richard". 

289
00:19:16,387 --> 00:19:17,895
And I'd always said that. 

290
00:19:17,895 --> 00:19:21,877
I didn't give a fuck about anyone else, it's Little Richard. 

291
00:19:21,877 --> 00:19:26,194
And he goes, "Yeah, he's my dad." I said, "Shut the fuck, really? 

292
00:19:26,194 --> 00:19:28,038
He goes, "Yeah, come here." 

293
00:19:28,038 --> 00:19:31,980
And there's this limo parked up front, and he goes... 

294
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,824
And the window comes down like... 

295
00:19:33,824 --> 00:19:36,590
And fucking Little Richard is sitting right there! 

296
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:41,620
I'm like, "Oh, my God." And he goes, "Hey, Dad, this guy..." 

297
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:44,680
And he was like, "What?" He said, "This guy's a musician". 

298
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,147
And he goes, "Oh." 

299
00:19:46,147 --> 00:19:49,919
And the window comes down and he goes, "God bless you!" 

300
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,859
How weird must it have been to be gay and black in Macon, Georgia 

301
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,033
in the '50s? 

302
00:19:55,033 --> 00:19:58,511
- And an amazing singer. 
- The best rock'n'roll singer ever. 

303
00:19:58,511 --> 00:20:02,327
I don't know who people consider the originator of rock'n'roll. 

304
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:05,805
That's who I think it is, Little Richard. He was crazy. 

305
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:09,578
Him, Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis. Those three. 

306
00:20:09,578 --> 00:20:13,769
You can't tell who did the first whatever, but between them, 

307
00:20:13,769 --> 00:20:15,614
they started rock'n'roll. 

308
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:28,439
When you meet the originals, you realise, like, 

309
00:20:28,439 --> 00:20:32,254
of course they're troubadours and renegades. 

310
00:20:32,254 --> 00:20:33,889
They're fucking freaks. 

311
00:20:38,751 --> 00:20:44,577
That's where you got all of the music that was different than anything else, like Little Richard, 

312
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:47,638
a gay black dude in Macon, Georgia in the '50s. 

313
00:20:47,638 --> 00:20:50,655
What was he gonna do? There was nothing he could do but 

314
00:20:50,655 --> 00:20:54,092
- play rock'n'roll. 
- Not going to be a boxer, is he? 
- Probably not! 

315
00:20:58,117 --> 00:21:01,679
People said, "Don't you like Prince?", back in the '70s and '80s. 

316
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,948
I said, "No, I've seen Jimi Hendrix". 

317
00:21:04,948 --> 00:21:08,973
He comes on with scarves all over him with a Stratocaster. 

318
00:21:08,973 --> 00:21:10,103
Are you kidding? 

319
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:12,870
I used to score for Mitch, I used to score dope for him. 

320
00:21:14,588 --> 00:21:16,685
And I used to score acid for Hendrix. 

321
00:21:16,685 --> 00:21:18,026
He was a very fair man. 

322
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:21,924
I would give him ten trips, and he would give me three and take seven. 

323
00:21:21,924 --> 00:21:25,278
- Very generous. 
- But you had to take them then, on the spot. 

324
00:21:27,876 --> 00:21:29,134
Yeah. 

325
00:21:29,134 --> 00:21:33,954
The thing is with acid, they say it doesn't work two days in a row. 

326
00:21:33,954 --> 00:21:36,763
But we found that if you double the dose, it does! 

327
00:21:58,809 --> 00:22:00,151
Gutsy ending. 

328
00:22:00,151 --> 00:22:01,786
Lemmy. 

329
00:22:14,655 --> 00:22:15,995
FINAL CHORD 

330
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,354
- Yeah! 
- Yeah. 

331
00:22:20,354 --> 00:22:24,840
- See you, buddy. When are you back? Are you here for good now? 
- I'm not away for a while. 

332
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:29,283
I'll call you when I get back. Let's grab a drink. I haven't been to the Rainbow in ages. 

333
00:22:29,283 --> 00:22:33,348
I had a fight going on with the fucking Darkness, this band, right? 

334
00:22:33,348 --> 00:22:38,336
That's why I called you, because I was sitting there. We went to the show and the show was fun. 

335
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:43,576
So we went to the Rainbow and we were sitting there, and I'm sitting at a table talking to the singer, 

336
00:22:43,576 --> 00:22:47,725
and he says, "Hey, you recorded a song with Lemmy, right?" I said, "Yeah". 

337
00:22:47,725 --> 00:22:52,085
He said, "We kind of have a little feud going with him right now." I was like, "Why?" 

338
00:22:52,085 --> 00:22:56,151
And he said, "He reviewed our record and he said it was fucking shit." 

339
00:22:56,151 --> 00:22:59,336
And I'm like, "Have you ever met him?" He said no. 

340
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:02,061
I don't think you had met him before. 

341
00:23:02,061 --> 00:23:06,420
I'm like, "Dude, he's the fucking greatest guy". He's like, "Yeah, well, 

342
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:09,438
"so I called him a fucking cunt or something in the press." 

343
00:23:09,438 --> 00:23:13,210
I'm like, "Honestly, he's a good dude. You'd like him". 

344
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:15,264
And I said, "I'm going to take a piss." 

345
00:23:15,264 --> 00:23:18,995
And I fucking got my cellphone and I'm like, "Lem, what are you doing? 

346
00:23:18,995 --> 00:23:22,431
- "Come on up for a drink!" 
- So I got the whole of Darkness there. 

347
00:23:22,431 --> 00:23:26,790
When he sees you coming, it was just like, "Oh, fuck me, no!" 

348
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:30,857
And Lemmy sat down. At first I'm like, "Hey, what's going on?" 

349
00:23:30,857 --> 00:23:33,790
He's like, "You know, I wanted to go to the Darkness gig, 

350
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,636
"but they banned me from the show". 

351
00:23:35,636 --> 00:23:40,581
- And I said, "Have you met Justin, the singer?" 
- I talked to him for about half an hour that night. 

352
00:23:40,581 --> 00:23:44,564
- Yeah. 
- And you didn't change my opinion one bit! 

353
00:23:44,564 --> 00:23:46,031
LAUGHTER 

354
00:23:46,031 --> 00:23:48,420
MOTORBIKE ENGINE ROARS 

355
00:23:54,665 --> 00:23:56,174
# Riots in the burning street 

356
00:23:56,174 --> 00:23:57,347
# Crystal night outside 

357
00:23:57,347 --> 00:23:59,192
# Brutal music in the night 

358
00:23:59,192 --> 00:24:00,492
# Enough to make you cry 

359
00:24:00,492 --> 00:24:02,503
# Nobody knows how it is 

360
00:24:02,503 --> 00:24:04,221
# To sleep and drown the world 

361
00:24:04,221 --> 00:24:07,575
# I am the midnight snake to bite your little girls 

362
00:24:07,575 --> 00:24:10,132
# Outside in the distance the city in the fire... # 

363
00:24:11,347 --> 00:24:17,049
The Rainbow Bar and Grill is the most famous restaurant bar 

364
00:24:17,049 --> 00:24:20,989
where musicians and hanger-oners and groupies... 

365
00:24:20,989 --> 00:24:24,090
It's sort of like the place 

366
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:27,778
to go hunt and the place to die at the same time. 

367
00:24:27,778 --> 00:24:29,245
It's a rocker place. 

368
00:24:29,245 --> 00:24:31,970
If you're a rock'n'roller, you come to the Rainbow. 

369
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,688
If you're not, don't come here. 

370
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:44,755
# Well lawdy lawdy lawdy Miss Clawdy 

371
00:24:44,755 --> 00:24:48,947
# Girl, you sure look good to me 

372
00:24:50,371 --> 00:24:53,054
# Please don't excite me, baby... # 

373
00:24:53,054 --> 00:24:58,000
In the '90s, for me anyway, Lemmy became synonymous with the Rainbow, because any time 

374
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,060
you'd go there, there he is playing the trivia machine. 

375
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:04,161
It literally became a joke. Like, "Let's go to the Rainbow 

376
00:25:04,161 --> 00:25:08,437
"and have a drink and say hi to Lemmy," like jokingly, and then Lemmy's there. 

377
00:25:08,437 --> 00:25:11,287
So many tourists come in, especially in summer. 

378
00:25:11,287 --> 00:25:14,012
"Is Lemmy here? Is Lemmy here?" 

379
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,520
He's not here, he's on tour. 

380
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,748
He's got to be one of two places, the Rainbow or on tour. 

381
00:25:18,748 --> 00:25:23,192
Just give Lemmy that game, a Jack and Coke and a cigarette, then he's there forever. 

382
00:25:23,192 --> 00:25:26,293
When people come in here and they go on the game 

383
00:25:26,293 --> 00:25:30,023
and they go, "It says Lemmy up there." "Yeah, Lemmy from Motorhead." 

384
00:25:30,023 --> 00:25:33,921
"No! It can't be." This is the middle of the afternoon. 

385
00:25:33,921 --> 00:25:37,108
Then all of a sudden, here's Lemmy sitting at the bar. 

386
00:25:37,108 --> 00:25:39,580
I've seen everything from chicks welling up 

387
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,305
to the frat guy go, "Oh, my God!" 

388
00:25:42,305 --> 00:25:44,863
It's best when they start crying. It's so cute. 

389
00:25:44,863 --> 00:25:47,837
Anyone that wants a picture, he'll take one. 

390
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:50,897
Anybody that wants to talk to him, he'll talk to them. 

391
00:25:50,897 --> 00:25:53,328
But you got to let him play his Megatouch first. 

392
00:25:53,328 --> 00:25:56,053
He'll be sitting there playing it. 

393
00:25:56,053 --> 00:26:00,664
Some sort of weird heavy-metal meditation, 

394
00:26:00,664 --> 00:26:04,981
mixed with Jack and Coke and something else that we won't disclose. 

395
00:26:17,053 --> 00:26:19,442
I was a house painter for about three weeks. 

396
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,346
Working for this old gay guy called Mr Brownsword. 

397
00:26:25,939 --> 00:26:29,041
How's that? It's true, too. 

398
00:26:29,041 --> 00:26:30,843
Mr fricking Brownsword. 

399
00:26:32,478 --> 00:26:34,531
It doesn't come any better than that. 

400
00:26:34,531 --> 00:26:36,417
Monty Python couldn't do better. 

401
00:26:36,417 --> 00:26:38,765
Luckily, he fancied my mate and not me, 

402
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:42,496
so I got to paint the upstairs while he was attacking Colin downstairs. 

403
00:26:42,496 --> 00:26:46,478
I worked at the riding stables in the summer. I worked on the fair 

404
00:26:46,478 --> 00:26:50,166
when the fair came round. What else? I worked in a factory for a while, 

405
00:26:50,166 --> 00:26:53,897
but that was terrible. I grew my hair, so they fired me. 

406
00:26:53,897 --> 00:26:57,586
We had the beach, the sea, the horses, so it was great. 

407
00:26:57,586 --> 00:26:59,470
I had a pretty good childhood. 

408
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:01,358
I ain't complaining. 

409
00:27:01,358 --> 00:27:05,340
Until they fucking ruined it and put the school in there. 

410
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:08,484
I had heard before that Lemmy went to school here, 

411
00:27:08,484 --> 00:27:10,957
but I had heard a load of rumours about it first. 

412
00:27:10,957 --> 00:27:13,555
I checked on the internet and found it was true. 

413
00:27:13,555 --> 00:27:16,992
- I heard Lemmy got expelled from this school. 
- For what reason? 

414
00:27:16,992 --> 00:27:20,052
Apparently, he was playing his guitar down the Tannoy, 

415
00:27:20,052 --> 00:27:22,065
but I'm not sure if that's true. 

416
00:27:22,065 --> 00:27:24,412
I don't know if he wanted to be a rock star. 

417
00:27:24,412 --> 00:27:27,178
I think it just came naturally. That is how he seems. 

418
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:28,981
He seems like pure rock. 

419
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:30,824
# If you like to gamble 

420
00:27:30,824 --> 00:27:32,837
# I tell you I'm your man. 

421
00:27:32,837 --> 00:27:34,639
# You win some lose some 

422
00:27:34,639 --> 00:27:36,608
# It's all the same to me 

423
00:27:39,501 --> 00:27:41,093
# The ace of spades 

424
00:27:41,093 --> 00:27:43,149
# The ace of spades 

425
00:27:43,149 --> 00:27:45,621
# The ace of spades 

426
00:27:45,621 --> 00:27:47,340
# The ace of spades! # 

427
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,016
Hi, Lemmy! 

428
00:27:56,561 --> 00:27:59,118
# Dandy Dandy 

429
00:27:59,118 --> 00:28:01,717
# Where you going to go now? 

430
00:28:01,717 --> 00:28:03,015
# Who you going to run to? 

431
00:28:04,357 --> 00:28:06,578
# All your little life 

432
00:28:06,578 --> 00:28:09,219
# You're chasing all the girls... # 

433
00:28:09,219 --> 00:28:12,656
I saw the Vickers at the Oasis in Manchester, and I thought 

434
00:28:12,656 --> 00:28:16,302
they were excellent, so I went and asked for a job with them. 

435
00:28:16,302 --> 00:28:18,357
# Chatting up the ladies 

436
00:28:18,357 --> 00:28:20,327
# Tickling the fancy 

437
00:28:21,836 --> 00:28:25,023
# Hiring out your charms... # 

438
00:28:25,023 --> 00:28:28,333
We'd be on with the Kinks, the Who, the Hollies. 

439
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:30,931
We played at South Pier, Blackpool, with the Who. 

440
00:28:30,931 --> 00:28:34,619
And all the audience were chanting "we want the Vickers." 

441
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:37,009
Roger Daltrey didn't like that. 

442
00:28:37,009 --> 00:28:39,482
They were a damn good band. 

443
00:28:39,482 --> 00:28:42,417
And compare very favourably 

444
00:28:42,417 --> 00:28:44,386
with any of the bands who were bigger, 

445
00:28:44,386 --> 00:28:47,824
like the Who and the Kinks and Manfred Mann and all those people. 

446
00:28:47,824 --> 00:28:52,057
At the time, they were as big in the north as the Kinks were in the South. 

447
00:28:52,057 --> 00:28:56,165
We just toured around the north of England, really. 

448
00:28:56,165 --> 00:28:58,931
We couldn't even get arrested in London. 

449
00:28:58,931 --> 00:29:02,158
North of Birmingham, we were big stars. This was 1965/6. 

450
00:29:02,158 --> 00:29:05,429
We were on �200 a week each, clear. 

451
00:29:05,429 --> 00:29:07,482
That's like �4,000 a week each now. 

452
00:29:07,482 --> 00:29:10,375
We all had Jags. We had a speedboat, for Christ's sake. 

453
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:12,847
We used to go water-skiing on Windermere. 

454
00:29:12,847 --> 00:29:16,997
It was rock 'n roll with a bit of thump. Very aggressive. 

455
00:29:16,997 --> 00:29:20,057
He would go up to his amplifier and feed his guitar back, 

456
00:29:20,057 --> 00:29:22,698
and he would make them scream. 

457
00:29:24,501 --> 00:29:27,309
When I first joined the Vickers, they were ambitious. 

458
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:32,338
They settled into this routine of doing the same gigs every year. 

459
00:29:33,763 --> 00:29:37,033
In the end, they became a cabaret show. 

460
00:29:37,033 --> 00:29:38,668
So it wasn't for me. 

461
00:29:38,668 --> 00:29:42,272
He wanted to be in the thick of it in London. 

462
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,362
And we didn't. 

463
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:59,417
What I really like about the Lemmy mythology is that he used to 

464
00:29:59,417 --> 00:30:01,931
be a roadie for Jimi Hendrix, too, 

465
00:30:01,931 --> 00:30:04,780
which scores a lot of points in my book, man. 

466
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:10,314
He would rather play an instrument than carry it. 

467
00:30:10,314 --> 00:30:12,284
And so that gives you the idea. 

468
00:30:13,417 --> 00:30:18,488
Just as a resume piece, defining "what is a rocker?", 

469
00:30:18,488 --> 00:30:22,512
he had it to his core, you know. 

470
00:30:22,512 --> 00:30:25,822
The kind of guy that says "If I can't be in the band... 

471
00:30:25,822 --> 00:30:27,918
"I'll carry their equipment". 

472
00:30:27,918 --> 00:30:29,972
He hung out with musicians, 

473
00:30:29,972 --> 00:30:34,249
and he did it continually until people let him play. 

474
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,554
He's really come up the hard way. 

475
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,008
He said one of the most amazing one-liners I've ever 

476
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:44,937
heard in my life, to me. 

477
00:30:44,937 --> 00:30:48,542
He said I remember before there was rock'n'roll. 

478
00:30:48,542 --> 00:30:52,692
I said "wow, that is a wild thing to say." 

479
00:30:52,692 --> 00:30:54,158
I said, "What do you mean?" 

480
00:30:54,158 --> 00:30:56,463
I'm not going to try and imitate his voice. 

481
00:30:56,463 --> 00:30:59,943
He said "I remember when there were only Rosemary Clooney records. 

482
00:30:59,943 --> 00:31:02,249
"I remember before there was rock'n'roll. 

483
00:31:02,249 --> 00:31:04,971
"There were just your mum's records." 

484
00:31:04,971 --> 00:31:06,650
I think I'm paraphrasing. 

485
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:10,170
He said something like "then we Elvis and never turned back. 

486
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:12,895
"We heard rock'n'roll" and said "that's us." 

487
00:31:12,895 --> 00:31:17,379
In the '60s, to get albums and singles, 

488
00:31:17,379 --> 00:31:20,901
I had to go down to the electrical appliance shop, 

489
00:31:20,901 --> 00:31:25,259
and he would order it for me from whatever company. 

490
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:29,032
He wasn't licensed to do it, it was just a friendly basis. 

491
00:31:29,032 --> 00:31:32,762
He would order them for me and three weeks later, they would come back. 

492
00:31:32,762 --> 00:31:34,733
The Buddy Holly record called Wishing, 

493
00:31:34,733 --> 00:31:38,254
and a Buddy Holly record called Learning The Game. 

494
00:31:38,254 --> 00:31:41,398
Eddie Cochran, Three Steps To Heaven, and Something Else. 

495
00:31:41,398 --> 00:31:44,457
Kids, without knowing it, when they listen to Motorhead, they're getting 

496
00:31:44,457 --> 00:31:47,685
Johnny Cash, Chuck Berry, Eddie Cochran. 

497
00:31:47,685 --> 00:31:50,619
It was the same thing with the original punk rock guys. 

498
00:31:50,619 --> 00:31:54,936
They were very influenced by that music. A lot of times, the fans don't know that. 

499
00:31:54,936 --> 00:31:57,954
But when they are listing to Ace Of Spades, 

500
00:31:57,954 --> 00:32:00,678
they are listing to Eddie Cochran. 

501
00:32:00,678 --> 00:32:02,983
That's Lem's influence. 

502
00:32:15,055 --> 00:32:20,588
# Well, I taught the weeping willow how to cry 

503
00:32:20,588 --> 00:32:25,661
# And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky... # 

504
00:32:25,661 --> 00:32:28,091
It is like what we did when we are were teenagers 

505
00:32:28,091 --> 00:32:30,690
and that is why we played music in the first place. 

506
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:33,833
The music was so real, so unpretentious, 

507
00:32:33,833 --> 00:32:36,432
that people can't help but like it. 

508
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:45,025
# A bad little kid moved into the neighbourhood... # 

509
00:32:45,025 --> 00:32:50,726
The genesis of Headcat was somebody wanted me to do one track for an Elvis tribute record. 

510
00:32:50,726 --> 00:32:54,121
I know Lem loves Elvis, as did Jonny Ramone, so I thought, 

511
00:32:54,121 --> 00:32:57,055
wouldn't it be cool to get Jon and Lem on the same record. 

512
00:32:57,055 --> 00:33:00,031
So we went in and we went and did the song. 

513
00:33:00,031 --> 00:33:04,139
Jon went home and we had all the studio time left because we did it so quickly. 

514
00:33:04,139 --> 00:33:08,624
We all knew the same songs by heart, so we said we should do an album. 

515
00:33:08,624 --> 00:33:10,384
So we did. 

516
00:33:10,384 --> 00:33:15,121
# Buys all the rock'n'roll books from the magazine stand. # 

517
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:28,198
This apartment is like a fucking museum. It is a museum. 

518
00:33:28,198 --> 00:33:31,342
I have seen museums with less shit in them. 

519
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,852
It is one of those things. 

520
00:33:32,852 --> 00:33:37,587
This was available and it was near the Rainbow, you know. 

521
00:33:37,587 --> 00:33:42,491
Because that is the only reference to LA I have ever had. 

522
00:33:42,491 --> 00:33:45,929
All I've ever done is stay at the Park Sunset and come up to the Rainbow. 

523
00:33:45,929 --> 00:33:50,163
Which is what we used to do. He's pretty cool, isn't he. 

524
00:33:52,802 --> 00:33:56,113
That is the Metal Hammer award. Two of them. 

525
00:33:56,113 --> 00:33:59,593
This is a porcelain model of me, 

526
00:33:59,593 --> 00:34:02,443
done by somebody and given to me on the road. 

527
00:34:02,443 --> 00:34:05,796
It is pretty interesting shit. You get given some great stuff. 

528
00:34:05,796 --> 00:34:09,485
The platinum album is from Joan Jett. 

529
00:34:09,485 --> 00:34:12,377
The gold one is from Lita Ford, 

530
00:34:12,377 --> 00:34:14,767
because I wrote a song on that album. 

531
00:34:14,767 --> 00:34:17,239
That's from a festival in Germany. 

532
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:19,503
And this is my Scottish clan - Fraser. 

533
00:34:19,503 --> 00:34:23,108
And this is my honorary membership in the Rangers. 

534
00:34:23,108 --> 00:34:25,539
There's my action figure. 

535
00:34:25,539 --> 00:34:27,845
You've got to keep these in their original boxes. 

536
00:34:27,845 --> 00:34:32,204
One day, it might be worth as much as 5. 

537
00:34:32,204 --> 00:34:35,180
Silver and gold records for Ace Of Spades. 

538
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:42,347
This is from Hammersmith Odeon. And this is by a German cat. 

539
00:34:42,347 --> 00:34:44,987
Pretty good, too, huh. 

540
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:51,233
I wish I hadn't dropped it, you know. 

541
00:34:52,742 --> 00:34:53,959
Why not move? 

542
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:56,934
For one thing, I'm never going to get a place for the money 

543
00:34:56,934 --> 00:34:58,401
I'm paying here. 

544
00:34:58,401 --> 00:35:01,042
I've got a place that is rent controlled, 

545
00:35:01,042 --> 00:35:03,976
they can't put it up by more than six percent a year, 

546
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:07,120
so I am still only paying 900 bucks for a block from Sunset. 

547
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,970
I am never going to get a deal like that. 

548
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:14,120
And I'd rather live around here because I like it around here. 

549
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:17,388
What's your most cherished possession in here? 

550
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:21,120
My son. 

551
00:35:23,803 --> 00:35:25,395
He's the only one I have got. 

552
00:35:25,395 --> 00:35:28,371
I mean, I have another one, but I have never seen him, 

553
00:35:28,371 --> 00:35:30,718
so he doesn't count, really. 

554
00:35:30,718 --> 00:35:32,563
Neither have I, no. 

555
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:36,251
His mother went and found him two years ago, 

556
00:35:36,251 --> 00:35:38,053
says he's five foot tall, 

557
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:43,502
just like me, and he is a computer fucking programmer, or something. 

558
00:35:45,975 --> 00:35:49,832
She's a social worker, and she's put on a bit of weight, 

559
00:35:49,832 --> 00:35:52,682
so she wears these Paisley smocks. 

560
00:35:52,682 --> 00:35:56,287
She said he put his head in his hands when she told him 

561
00:35:56,287 --> 00:36:00,856
she was his mother, she said she hadn't got a heart to tell him who his father was! 

562
00:36:00,856 --> 00:36:04,167
Probably be out in the parking lot with a fucking pistol. 

563
00:36:09,574 --> 00:36:13,136
But you can't win them all, can you? Where would you put them? 

564
00:36:13,136 --> 00:36:14,688
Yes, but I mean... 

565
00:36:14,688 --> 00:36:19,089
I don't know, I just like stuff. I've always liked stuff. 

566
00:36:19,089 --> 00:36:20,807
Stuff is what happens, you know. 

567
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:24,370
In your life, you get stuff. 

568
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:27,807
Then you lose some stuff and you keep some stuff, and then at the end, 

569
00:36:27,807 --> 00:36:30,783
you leave it for some other poor bastard to be saddled with 

570
00:36:30,783 --> 00:36:32,334
it the rest of their lives. 

571
00:36:35,017 --> 00:36:38,370
Don't worry, you'll have all of this shit soon enough. 

572
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:39,962
I'm looking forward to that. 

573
00:36:39,962 --> 00:36:41,262
I have no doubt, yeah. 

574
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:46,837
- I'd rather have you than all of that stuff. 
- I know, yeah. 

575
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:49,646
I can never imagine why that is. 

576
00:36:49,646 --> 00:36:52,873
Why would people rather have some gobsmacked human 

577
00:36:52,873 --> 00:36:56,227
instead of a load of money? I've never understood that. 

578
00:36:56,227 --> 00:36:58,490
Money doesn't love you back, does it? 

579
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:01,256
You can spend it, but it doesn't love you back. 

580
00:37:01,256 --> 00:37:02,765
You can imagine it does. 

581
00:37:02,765 --> 00:37:05,154
I know you met your dad when you were six. 

582
00:37:07,334 --> 00:37:09,220
I met him, too. 

583
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,484
Yes, we met each other at the same time. 

584
00:37:11,484 --> 00:37:15,590
- Funny how that happens. 
- Like two ships meeting in the cosmos. 

585
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:18,441
It's a memory that is all frayed around the edges, 

586
00:37:18,441 --> 00:37:20,789
and all sepia toned. 

587
00:37:20,789 --> 00:37:25,818
- I was sepia then, I was almost see-through, in fact. 
- Yeah. 

588
00:37:25,818 --> 00:37:30,723
I just remember tugging at these slim legs in jeans. 

589
00:37:30,723 --> 00:37:32,063
That's me, you see. 

590
00:37:32,063 --> 00:37:35,375
I was very small, so I just saw the legs. 

591
00:37:35,375 --> 00:37:37,556
Then what happened? 

592
00:37:37,556 --> 00:37:40,490
- I don't really remember. 
- There was a dope deal. 

593
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:43,632
I was waiting for some hash to arrive, or something, 

594
00:37:43,632 --> 00:37:46,525
and I was in the kitchen making a piece of toast 

595
00:37:46,525 --> 00:37:51,681
and the small blonde child came in, "you're my dad, 

596
00:37:51,681 --> 00:37:54,111
"I am your son and my mum's in the other room." 

597
00:37:54,111 --> 00:37:56,585
I looked around and there was Tracey, 

598
00:37:56,585 --> 00:37:59,267
babbling like an idiot as usual. 

599
00:37:59,267 --> 00:38:04,381
I don't even know how have he got there, she wasn't in on 

600
00:38:04,381 --> 00:38:09,327
the dope deal because she didn't do drugs, so why was she there? 

601
00:38:09,327 --> 00:38:13,686
- How did she get in there? 
- She went looking for you, I know that. 

602
00:38:13,686 --> 00:38:21,441
That's because when I was about four, I was in kindergarten, right. 

603
00:38:21,441 --> 00:38:22,698
Right. 

604
00:38:22,698 --> 00:38:25,590
And there was this other kid that came up to me 

605
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:29,698
and he said, "I've got a daddy and mummy." 

606
00:38:29,698 --> 00:38:32,087
I said, "I've only got a mummy." 

607
00:38:32,087 --> 00:38:33,806
He said, "you must have a daddy 

608
00:38:33,806 --> 00:38:36,824
"because everybody has a daddy and mummy." 

609
00:38:36,824 --> 00:38:40,723
- So I went home and said... 
- Where is my daddy? You bitch?! 

610
00:38:40,723 --> 00:38:42,567
And I got this look like... 

611
00:38:42,567 --> 00:38:44,747
We don't talk about him in this house! 

612
00:38:47,051 --> 00:38:48,937
Then I think, after that, 

613
00:38:48,937 --> 00:38:53,548
endeavours were made to introduce us to each other. 

614
00:38:53,548 --> 00:38:57,027
I didn't want to live with his mother, you see. 

615
00:38:57,027 --> 00:38:59,499
It was only casual sex, really. 

616
00:38:59,499 --> 00:39:05,285
I mean, I like Tracey, she is great and she did a really good job 

617
00:39:05,285 --> 00:39:09,644
bringing him up, up to a point, and he has turned out to be 

618
00:39:09,644 --> 00:39:12,537
a really clever kid, and he is a great musician. 

619
00:39:12,537 --> 00:39:14,548
You have no idea how good he is. 

620
00:39:14,548 --> 00:39:16,979
My mum knew the Beatles, right? 

621
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:20,751
Yes, she used to go out with John Lennon, didn't she? 

622
00:39:20,751 --> 00:39:23,644
Obviously trying to get to Paul McCartney through him. 

623
00:39:23,644 --> 00:39:25,866
No, she lost her virginity to John Lennon. 

624
00:39:25,866 --> 00:39:30,853
The story I was told by my mum is that George liked her 

625
00:39:30,853 --> 00:39:32,949
and he would shyly, coyly look at her 

626
00:39:32,949 --> 00:39:34,751
when he walked past a bus stop. 

627
00:39:34,751 --> 00:39:39,320
George was standing there, she wasn't interested in George. 

628
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,457
And then, um... 

629
00:39:41,457 --> 00:39:44,979
But I don't know, maybe if she had been interested, 

630
00:39:44,979 --> 00:39:48,248
it would have lasted longer than with John. 

631
00:39:48,248 --> 00:39:51,769
- It didn't last long with John, did it? 
- No, it didn't. 

632
00:39:51,769 --> 00:39:55,499
But she always talked about it, she was very smitten. 

633
00:39:55,499 --> 00:39:59,146
But she called you after Paul, not John. 

634
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:01,159
Yes, that is a strange one. 

635
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:04,973
She must have been thinking about Paul when she was with John. 

636
00:40:04,973 --> 00:40:08,746
Perhaps she called him Paul and that is why it didn't last. 

637
00:40:08,746 --> 00:40:11,093
- I love you, Paul! 
- Yeah! 

638
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:16,750
We swapped girlfriends twice, didn't we? 

639
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:20,146
At The Limelight and at Stringfellows. 

640
00:40:20,146 --> 00:40:22,495
We swapped girlfriends one night 

641
00:40:22,495 --> 00:40:25,218
and then did it again two months later. 

642
00:40:27,188 --> 00:40:30,583
A lot of chicks like that, the old man and the son. 

643
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:37,206
It's like screwing the daughter and the mother at the same time. 

644
00:40:37,206 --> 00:40:38,799
- That kind of thing. 
- Yeah. 

645
00:40:43,661 --> 00:40:46,049
Does it ever feel too cluttered for you? 

646
00:40:46,049 --> 00:40:49,236
Yeah. All the time. What do you think? 

647
00:40:49,236 --> 00:40:52,840
Are you shooting the trash can? Fuck off, man. 

648
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,103
You better not put that in... 

649
00:40:55,103 --> 00:40:57,158
- Where is the trash can? 
- There. 

650
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:04,284
I didn't see that, I was looking at that, whatever that is. 

651
00:41:04,284 --> 00:41:07,511
That's a fucking Domino's bargain list. 

652
00:41:07,511 --> 00:41:10,739
'One of my favourite memories of my dad was' 

653
00:41:10,739 --> 00:41:12,835
when I was six years old, 

654
00:41:12,835 --> 00:41:17,823
and I was just learning to play three or four chords. 

655
00:41:17,823 --> 00:41:21,260
He came to visit and as he was leaving, he picked up 

656
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,564
one of the other guitars and started 

657
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:26,624
playing by the front door, like E major, 

658
00:41:26,624 --> 00:41:33,079
and we just a jammed on that one chord for about 20 minutes. 

659
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:38,026
And he was just looking right into my face, right into my eyes. 

660
00:41:38,026 --> 00:41:40,247
Just egging me on. 

661
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:43,391
This is the rhythm, this is the feel, this is how you do it. 

662
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:52,781
Probably the third time I had ever seen him, something like that. 

663
00:41:52,781 --> 00:41:56,007
So that was a major event in my life. 

664
00:41:56,007 --> 00:41:58,690
The nicest thing he ever said to me was very recently, 

665
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:02,169
was when you asked him what was the most precious thing in the room, 

666
00:42:02,169 --> 00:42:05,984
and he said, "my son." 

667
00:42:07,282 --> 00:42:12,815
I was kind of blown away by that, I wasn't expecting that response. 

668
00:42:12,815 --> 00:42:16,588
I wasn't thinking he would say that. That was amazing. 

669
00:42:16,588 --> 00:42:17,972
It was wonderful. 

670
00:42:17,972 --> 00:42:21,282
Thank you. This is my son, Paul. 

671
00:42:23,797 --> 00:42:26,102
Not bad for an only child. 

672
00:42:28,031 --> 00:42:30,797
# I'm so lazy... # 

673
00:42:37,672 --> 00:42:41,528
- Go and take it to him. 
- That is some size. That's cool. 

674
00:42:44,923 --> 00:42:48,444
I present this tank... LAUGHS 

675
00:42:51,126 --> 00:42:53,306
- Isn't that bad? 
- Yeah, it is. 

676
00:42:53,306 --> 00:42:55,905
I served several years in the US Army 

677
00:42:55,905 --> 00:42:58,755
as a special operations soldier, 

678
00:42:58,755 --> 00:43:01,605
both in the Ranger Regiment and special forces 

679
00:43:01,605 --> 00:43:04,498
and have served in Iraq and Afghanistan. 

680
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:07,180
I know Lemmy is a big military history buff. 

681
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:13,972
That is my kind of rock and roll connective tissue to the military. 

682
00:43:13,972 --> 00:43:16,821
It was probably Motorhead. 

683
00:43:18,288 --> 00:43:22,396
I would wear Motorhead t-shirts over there, 

684
00:43:22,396 --> 00:43:25,120
in a way stating my own individuality. 

685
00:43:26,629 --> 00:43:31,198
Not to glorify war or to say, war is really cool, or whatever, 

686
00:43:31,198 --> 00:43:32,580
it is what it is. 

687
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:34,804
It is a function of the human condition. 

688
00:43:34,804 --> 00:43:39,037
Motorhead is good go to war music. 

689
00:43:39,037 --> 00:43:42,934
Most people would know he is a World Wars One and Two historian. 

690
00:43:42,934 --> 00:43:46,832
1916, their first Grammy nomination record, 

691
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:48,929
that was about World War One. 

692
00:43:48,929 --> 00:43:54,293
He's a collector, in, I would say, war memorabilia in general. 

693
00:43:54,293 --> 00:43:57,815
I remember watching a BBC documentary with him, 

694
00:43:57,815 --> 00:44:01,462
he was showing me an aeroplane, a Messerschmitt or something, 

695
00:44:01,462 --> 00:44:04,815
I'm trying to remember what it was, and he was saying that's wrong. 

696
00:44:04,815 --> 00:44:07,958
I said it was a documentary, they must have researched this shit, 

697
00:44:07,958 --> 00:44:12,611
he brings out three books showing that it wasn't even built then. 

698
00:44:39,395 --> 00:44:41,575
Everybody collects something, right? 

699
00:44:41,575 --> 00:44:45,389
General Malband used to collect elephants. 

700
00:44:45,389 --> 00:44:47,820
Elephants all over his fucking apartment. 

701
00:44:49,581 --> 00:44:53,687
I think my collection is more interesting. 

702
00:44:57,712 --> 00:45:00,269
Luftwaffe Damascus sword. 

703
00:45:00,269 --> 00:45:02,030
See the blade? 

704
00:45:03,622 --> 00:45:05,048
That's Damascus steel. 

705
00:45:05,048 --> 00:45:08,695
That's a Luftwaffe middle dagger. 

706
00:45:11,252 --> 00:45:13,891
That is quite pretty, I think. 

707
00:45:16,408 --> 00:45:21,814
Purely decorational. These are Masonic daggers. 

708
00:45:23,282 --> 00:45:25,125
Look at that. 

709
00:45:31,244 --> 00:45:35,519
That is a nice piece, too. This is from Toledo. 

710
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:36,611
Not Ohio. 

711
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:42,981
Look at this fucking thing. 

712
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:47,089
- What is that? 
- British. 

713
00:45:50,149 --> 00:45:54,215
That is British, I think it is from the First World War. 

714
00:45:54,215 --> 00:45:57,358
And this is a German bayonet. 

715
00:46:00,419 --> 00:46:05,281
That's seen action. I always liked the workmanship and the designs. 

716
00:46:05,281 --> 00:46:08,047
They were the last great knife makers, 

717
00:46:08,047 --> 00:46:10,142
the last great sword makers. 

718
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:14,585
It is a craft in Germany that has largely disappeared. 

719
00:46:16,263 --> 00:46:19,532
Even the American swords were made in Germany. 

720
00:46:19,532 --> 00:46:22,256
In the civil war in America, a lot of German swords were 

721
00:46:22,256 --> 00:46:26,574
used in that war, and up until the First World War. 

722
00:46:26,574 --> 00:46:32,652
I've got Argentinian stuff, Yugoslav, Croat, Slovakian. 

723
00:46:32,652 --> 00:46:37,556
How long has it taken you to amass this collection? Years and years? 

724
00:46:37,556 --> 00:46:39,652
19 years, yeah. 

725
00:46:39,652 --> 00:46:42,794
When I came over to the States, I had nothing. 

726
00:46:46,986 --> 00:46:49,543
So there we are. Come on. 

727
00:46:49,543 --> 00:46:52,855
ENGINE ROARS 

728
00:47:14,694 --> 00:47:18,465
- Thought I'd dress up. 
- Yeah, you look good! 

729
00:47:18,465 --> 00:47:24,250
- Good to meet you. 
- Scott, nice to meet you. Check it out. 

730
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:27,687
MP40s, G43, K98. 

731
00:47:27,687 --> 00:47:29,405
That's a nice gun, that. 

732
00:47:29,405 --> 00:47:33,596
- That's a chassis of a 222, isn't it? 
- That is a 251. 
- 251. 

733
00:47:33,596 --> 00:47:37,159
- What was the chassis? 
- A 38T. 

734
00:47:39,927 --> 00:47:43,992
- Skoda? 
- Right. 
- So did you have to restore it? 

735
00:47:43,992 --> 00:47:47,261
Yeah. It's got an original engine in it. 

736
00:47:56,148 --> 00:47:57,782
ENGINE STARTS 

737
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:11,573
This was actually the smallest tank that the Germans made. 

738
00:48:11,573 --> 00:48:13,500
It was made in Czechoslovakia, 

739
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:16,854
based on the Skoda design from before the war. 

740
00:48:16,854 --> 00:48:21,884
This was called a Hetzer, a 38T chassis, it was a tank killer. 

741
00:48:21,884 --> 00:48:23,980
This is a big gun for a tank this size. 

742
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:27,710
It is a 75 millimetre, armour piercing gun, you know. 

743
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:30,309
This would stop anything, more or less. 

744
00:48:34,668 --> 00:48:37,938
They buried this tank in the ground, right, 

745
00:48:37,938 --> 00:48:41,123
so that all that would be visible would be this, 

746
00:48:41,123 --> 00:48:44,434
just the gun and the top of the tank. 

747
00:48:44,434 --> 00:48:49,297
So they would sit there and wait for you to come along and just kill you. 

748
00:48:51,392 --> 00:48:53,656
Wars are the most interesting times. 

749
00:48:53,656 --> 00:48:56,591
It shows the best and the worst in people. 

750
00:48:56,591 --> 00:49:00,405
You get to find out who your real friends are. 

751
00:49:00,405 --> 00:49:03,841
Ask any of those boys coming back from Iraq, you know. 

752
00:49:03,841 --> 00:49:07,321
Anybody who's watching this film and thinks that you're Nazi, 

753
00:49:07,321 --> 00:49:09,039
what do you want to say to them? 

754
00:49:09,039 --> 00:49:12,015
Well, I've had six black girlfriends, so far. 

755
00:49:12,015 --> 00:49:15,829
So, I'm one of the worst Nazis you ever met, right? 

756
00:49:15,829 --> 00:49:17,506
Imagine going to Nuremberg 

757
00:49:17,506 --> 00:49:21,237
and introducing my girlfriend to the Fuhrer? I don't think so. 

758
00:49:21,237 --> 00:49:23,962
I just dress how I like to dress. 

759
00:49:25,637 --> 00:49:28,656
I don't ask anybody else to do it. 

760
00:49:28,656 --> 00:49:31,799
It's a free country, supposedly. 

761
00:49:32,973 --> 00:49:36,368
I've often said if the Israeli Army had the best uniforms, 

762
00:49:36,368 --> 00:49:38,296
I would collect those. 

763
00:49:38,296 --> 00:49:41,817
But they don't, you know? So there you go. 

764
00:49:41,817 --> 00:49:45,967
It's ridiculous to think that I could be a Nazi. 

765
00:49:45,967 --> 00:49:48,356
I'm about as far from it as you can get. 

766
00:49:50,157 --> 00:49:52,590
Fire! 

767
00:49:59,003 --> 00:50:01,559
- How was that, Lemmy? 
- That was great. 

768
00:50:14,176 --> 00:50:17,613
MUSIC: "Silver Machine" by Hawkwind 

769
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:25,535
I think Hawkwind were really ahead of their time. 

770
00:50:25,535 --> 00:50:29,223
I worship Hawkwind. That is some genius music. 

771
00:50:33,752 --> 00:50:36,601
They were kind of like a prog rock group 

772
00:50:36,601 --> 00:50:39,619
that punks were allowed to like. 

773
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:43,727
# I, I just took a ride 

774
00:50:45,487 --> 00:50:48,966
# In a silver machine 

775
00:50:48,966 --> 00:50:51,985
# And I'm still feeling mean... # 

776
00:50:51,985 --> 00:50:55,422
It was dangerous rock and roll. It's not choreographed. 

777
00:50:55,422 --> 00:50:58,356
It's not safe, it's not cliched. 

778
00:50:58,356 --> 00:51:02,044
You never know what you are going to see. 

779
00:51:02,044 --> 00:51:04,223
That has got to be good. 

780
00:51:06,864 --> 00:51:10,511
We're a space rock band, so a lot of the music we played 

781
00:51:10,511 --> 00:51:14,157
was around science fiction stories, which we would interpret into music. 

782
00:51:14,157 --> 00:51:18,643
So we were a pretty heavy rock band with nice, flowing electronics. 

783
00:51:18,643 --> 00:51:23,002
People thought we were some sort of hippy, fucking, flower people, and it wasn't true. 

784
00:51:23,002 --> 00:51:24,762
We were a black nightmare. 

785
00:51:24,762 --> 00:51:28,199
We used to lock the doors so people couldn't get out. 

786
00:51:28,199 --> 00:51:33,355
It was a psychedelic experience, and no-one was doing that sort of thing. 

787
00:51:33,355 --> 00:51:35,702
We just used to have this trancey beat going. 

788
00:51:35,702 --> 00:51:39,475
This trancey rhythm, and a strobe going. 

789
00:51:39,475 --> 00:51:43,206
It didn't drive you insane, it's just put you into a trance. 

790
00:51:43,206 --> 00:51:45,887
# I got a silver machine 

791
00:51:45,887 --> 00:51:49,325
# I got a silver machine 

792
00:51:49,325 --> 00:51:51,547
# I got a silver machine... # 

793
00:51:51,547 --> 00:51:56,702
For New Order, the driving sound that Hawkwind had, 

794
00:51:56,702 --> 00:51:59,762
the very pulsing, percussive keyboard sounds, 

795
00:51:59,762 --> 00:52:02,528
we would actually listen to that 

796
00:52:02,528 --> 00:52:05,924
and to try and emulate it in songs like Temptation 

797
00:52:05,924 --> 00:52:09,612
and Everything's Gone Green. We did try and rip off Hawkwind. 

798
00:52:09,612 --> 00:52:12,127
They represented the first counter-culture. 

799
00:52:12,127 --> 00:52:15,816
Alternative. That was all coming up. 

800
00:52:15,816 --> 00:52:18,582
It was a wonderful time to be a kid. 

801
00:52:18,582 --> 00:52:21,768
But mostly, I remember standing at the front, 

802
00:52:21,768 --> 00:52:25,582
drooling at Stacia. The girl with her breasts out, 

803
00:52:25,582 --> 00:52:28,726
which was incredible for a 12 or 13-year-old. 

804
00:52:28,726 --> 00:52:31,114
It was like OUR education. 

805
00:52:32,917 --> 00:52:35,474
We were a bunch of misfits. 

806
00:52:35,474 --> 00:52:38,492
It was like a family, you know. It was like a family. 

807
00:52:38,492 --> 00:52:42,349
We had a huge following, because we would do any gig. 

808
00:52:42,349 --> 00:52:45,911
We would do a gig in London and it would be like a drug dealers' convention. 

809
00:52:45,911 --> 00:52:50,438
Dik Mik and Lemmy was always into a lot of speed. 

810
00:52:50,438 --> 00:52:53,120
Dick was grumpy, because they had been up for a few days, 

811
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:56,054
and we would get picked up in a van and he would be all grumpy. 

812
00:52:56,054 --> 00:52:59,157
Lemmy would be all surly, and would slam the door and sit down. 

813
00:52:59,157 --> 00:53:02,677
We were in the States touring, and we were in Niles, Michigan, 

814
00:53:02,677 --> 00:53:04,941
on the way to Detroit. 

815
00:53:04,941 --> 00:53:09,174
Niles is on the other side of Michigan from where Detroit is. 

816
00:53:09,174 --> 00:53:14,162
We pulled over at a roadhouse to eat, and I was not hungry, 

817
00:53:14,162 --> 00:53:15,588
being a speed-freak. 

818
00:53:15,588 --> 00:53:17,348
I just got this new camera. 

819
00:53:17,348 --> 00:53:20,450
So, I went prowling around looking for things to film, 

820
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:23,006
you know, new camera. 

821
00:53:23,006 --> 00:53:27,449
And I conked over the head in this abandoned housing project. 

822
00:53:27,449 --> 00:53:30,970
When I came round, without my camera, without any money, 

823
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:35,120
and I got back to the road house, and they'd gone. 

824
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:38,935
They'd dumped me there. What kind of shit is that? 

825
00:53:38,935 --> 00:53:42,120
If one of your band members is missing after you have a meal, 

826
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:46,395
you just drive off? That's not the way I work. 

827
00:53:46,395 --> 00:53:50,295
So now I'm stuck, so I have to hitch-hike across Michigan. 

828
00:53:50,295 --> 00:53:52,934
I got to my room, crash out for about two hours, 

829
00:53:52,934 --> 00:53:54,778
do the sound check, do the show, 

830
00:53:54,778 --> 00:54:00,060
and then the next day I got busted for speed. 

831
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:05,551
In jail for two days in Canada, handcuffed to a fucking iron bar. 

832
00:54:05,551 --> 00:54:09,742
Then I get the news that I am going in to Essex County jail. 

833
00:54:09,742 --> 00:54:13,933
With my overalls on, going in to the delousing section. 

834
00:54:13,933 --> 00:54:19,466
Then this guy says, "you are bailed." Thank you. 

835
00:54:19,466 --> 00:54:22,904
Flown to Toronto immediately, do the show, 

836
00:54:22,904 --> 00:54:24,791
four o'clock in the morning, fired. 

837
00:54:24,791 --> 00:54:26,760
Apparently, they only got me out of jail 

838
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:29,276
because my replacement couldn't make it in time. 

839
00:54:29,276 --> 00:54:33,508
I found Lemmy, in certain ways, quite hard to work with. 

840
00:54:33,508 --> 00:54:36,694
We were in a band where everybody was taking different drugs. 

841
00:54:36,694 --> 00:54:39,169
So you had this disparity between people 

842
00:54:39,169 --> 00:54:42,857
of where they were, and what sort of wavelength they were on. 

843
00:54:42,857 --> 00:54:47,215
I was into psychedelics, pot, and mushrooms, peyote, 

844
00:54:47,215 --> 00:54:50,736
that sort of thing. Pretty calm stuff, you know? 

845
00:54:50,736 --> 00:54:54,257
And Lemmy was more into amphetamines. 

846
00:54:54,257 --> 00:54:57,986
He used to hang the band up because he was never on time to leave in the morning. 

847
00:54:57,986 --> 00:55:00,586
We would have to get up, and catch a flight somewhere, 

848
00:55:00,586 --> 00:55:03,478
and we'd all be downstairs and be waiting to go. 

849
00:55:03,478 --> 00:55:06,665
"Christ, where is he?" And he'd still be in bed. 

850
00:55:06,665 --> 00:55:08,593
"Come on Lemmy, for Christ's sake." 

851
00:55:08,593 --> 00:55:11,861
It did cause a lot of stress within the band. 

852
00:55:11,861 --> 00:55:13,581
All of us got pissed off. 

853
00:55:13,581 --> 00:55:16,346
It wasn't just one or two, we did get pissed off. 

854
00:55:16,346 --> 00:55:19,742
Then he got busted at the border, sort of thing. 

855
00:55:19,742 --> 00:55:25,443
When you're on tour, it's like the last straw. 

856
00:55:25,443 --> 00:55:30,765
It was decided, the majority, the band said, no, enough's enough. That was it. 

857
00:55:30,765 --> 00:55:35,837
When I arrived at the gig and said, "where the fuck's Lemmy?" 

858
00:55:35,837 --> 00:55:42,377
They said, this other guy, Paul Rudolph, was taking his place. 

859
00:55:42,377 --> 00:55:48,203
They'd sacked Lemmy. I mean, I was devastated. 

860
00:55:48,203 --> 00:55:53,651
But I'm the type of person... I keep a lot inside. So... 

861
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:03,921
I think I just carried on. But I was devastated. 

862
00:56:03,921 --> 00:56:06,730
It was a sad thing, actually. 

863
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:10,167
Very sad. He was very upset over it. 

864
00:56:10,167 --> 00:56:13,646
And, er... We all were, really. 

865
00:56:13,646 --> 00:56:19,430
It was coming for a long time. It was '70s drugs snobbery. 

866
00:56:19,430 --> 00:56:21,987
They were just doing organic drugs, man, 

867
00:56:21,987 --> 00:56:25,759
and I was doing speed and organic drugs. They didn't like that. 

868
00:56:25,759 --> 00:56:29,700
He hated us for it all. You would, wouldn't you? 

869
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:34,646
He described me as a sanctimonious, self-righteous asshole. 

870
00:56:34,646 --> 00:56:38,586
I thought, that's all right, that's what he thinks of me. 

871
00:56:38,586 --> 00:56:41,772
I went and screwed three of their old ladies. 

872
00:56:44,872 --> 00:56:47,471
Vengeance is sweet, sayeth the Lord. 

873
00:56:47,471 --> 00:56:50,783
I must admit, I was banging one of them already. 

874
00:56:50,783 --> 00:56:52,753
Before I left. 

875
00:56:52,753 --> 00:56:54,555
But it was a great time. 

876
00:56:54,555 --> 00:56:57,405
I wouldn't have traded it for any other band, ever. 

877
00:56:57,405 --> 00:57:01,094
I would probably have been in that now if they hadn't fired me. 

878
00:57:01,094 --> 00:57:02,478
But there you are. 

879
00:57:02,478 --> 00:57:06,460
It was quite good for him because look where he is now. 

880
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:09,604
How long have I been on the road? 19 years. 

881
00:57:09,604 --> 00:57:15,849
- 19 years? 
- Give or take a year. 
- Isn't it boring after a while? 

882
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:18,531
- No. 
- Why is there so much violence on the road? 

883
00:57:18,531 --> 00:57:20,962
- Why do you break things? 
- What violence? 

884
00:57:20,962 --> 00:57:22,262
I mean, the violence. 

885
00:57:22,262 --> 00:57:25,196
When you start... When you start doing things... 

886
00:57:25,196 --> 00:57:27,585
What fucking violence? 

887
00:57:29,429 --> 00:57:33,075
I don't know what you mean about violence. 

888
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:35,800
You want to see some violence, baby? 

889
00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:42,967
No, not me! 

890
00:57:44,603 --> 00:57:46,574
Want to do an interview? 

891
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:03,632
Lemmy was at the beginning of heavy-metal, 

892
00:58:03,632 --> 00:58:05,392
maybe even pre Black Sabbath. 

893
00:58:05,392 --> 00:58:10,674
If they'd said to me, who was the original metal man?, 

894
00:58:10,674 --> 00:58:13,315
it is a toss between Lemmy and Black Sabbath. 

895
00:58:13,315 --> 00:58:15,453
But I would say Lem, and Motorhead. 

896
00:58:18,849 --> 00:58:23,543
It took elements of what existed as heavy metal, mixed it with punk 

897
00:58:23,543 --> 00:58:27,440
and created this frantic, intense, powerful music form 

898
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,793
that went on to define heavy metal as we know it. 

899
00:58:30,793 --> 00:58:33,225
It was brash, in your face, 

900
00:58:33,225 --> 00:58:35,991
it was like getting socked by an overhand right, 

901
00:58:35,991 --> 00:58:37,709
like Mike Tyson in his prime. 

902
00:58:37,709 --> 00:58:42,278
You'd turn the radio on and it was really rancid disco, 

903
00:58:42,278 --> 00:58:44,835
bad boy band pop-music, you know? 

904
00:58:44,835 --> 00:58:46,890
The Osmonds, stuff like that. 

905
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:50,495
You'd go and see a Motorhead show and it was completely different. 

906
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:54,812
# The silver-tongued devil, demon lynch 

907
00:58:54,812 --> 00:58:58,500
# I know just what I'm doing 

908
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:02,231
# I like a little innocent bitch... # 

909
00:59:02,231 --> 00:59:07,261
I could not believe that this, there was a guy singing like that 

910
00:59:07,261 --> 00:59:11,201
on a record, and people were digging it. Whoa! 

911
00:59:11,201 --> 00:59:14,177
We had headlines like the worst band in the world, 

912
00:59:14,177 --> 00:59:18,704
but it was in big letters. Well, I mean, fucking great. 

913
00:59:18,704 --> 00:59:22,770
Cause I didn't give a, well, you kind of care up to a point, 

914
00:59:22,770 --> 00:59:24,403
but the kids were turning up. 

915
00:59:24,403 --> 00:59:28,637
"I want to see the worst band in the world." They must be great. 

916
00:59:31,572 --> 00:59:35,470
'Motorhead was speed music, with three people on speed. 

917
00:59:35,470 --> 00:59:38,697
'Consistency of energy could be contributed to that' 

918
00:59:38,697 --> 00:59:40,123
And our slim figures. 

919
00:59:40,123 --> 00:59:42,511
LAUGHS 

920
00:59:44,105 --> 00:59:48,380
'Everybody tried to be that heavy after that. Nobody's achieved it.' 

921
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:51,398
We fancied ourselves, Guns N' Roses did, 

922
00:59:51,398 --> 00:59:54,960
but if we could be even close to as heavy as Motorhead, 

923
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,518
we'd be successful. 

924
00:59:57,518 --> 00:59:59,823
'Back when I was young, 19, 

925
00:59:59,823 --> 01:00:03,553
late '70s, early '80s, we were very punk rock. 

926
01:00:03,553 --> 01:00:08,625
I had my little shelf of my old rock records I bought as a kid, 

927
01:00:08,625 --> 01:00:12,775
Steve Miller, Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin, all these bands I used to go see. 

928
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:16,086
Then punk-rock happened and I saw the Clash and the Ramones 

929
01:00:16,086 --> 01:00:19,900
and my life was changing, all of a sudden, that's the old, in with the new. 

930
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:22,960
And you'd see someone with long hair, well, he's a hippie. 

931
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:26,606
I can't listen to that music, Johnny Rotten says... 

932
01:00:26,606 --> 01:00:30,967
And then someone would pull out the Ace Of Spades record. 

933
01:00:30,967 --> 01:00:33,564
Oh, oh, wait a minute. 

934
01:00:33,564 --> 01:00:37,715
This kind of goes against the gospel of the punk rock, 

935
01:00:37,715 --> 01:00:40,354
because they have long hair and it's metal, 

936
01:00:40,354 --> 01:00:45,888
but you put the record on and go, "Damn, man. I'm a Motorhead fan." 

937
01:00:45,888 --> 01:00:49,284
#..playing hide and seek cos I'm a speed freak...# 

938
01:00:49,284 --> 01:00:52,510
'It was their look, it was their attitude, their music.' 

939
01:00:52,510 --> 01:00:56,075
You felt by listening to their records that they didn't fit in. 

940
01:00:56,075 --> 01:00:58,966
You felt that. And when you didn't fit in yourself, 

941
01:00:58,966 --> 01:01:01,858
there was that instant lightning bolt connection. 

942
01:01:01,858 --> 01:01:05,254
"Oh, Shit. They're one of us. They're us." 

943
01:01:05,254 --> 01:01:07,895
INSTRUMENTAL 

944
01:01:13,385 --> 01:01:18,457
I think personally, this tour is the antidote to Simon Cowell 

945
01:01:18,457 --> 01:01:21,014
and all the evil, shit music that he's purveying! 

946
01:01:21,014 --> 01:01:23,613
CROWD CHEERS 

947
01:01:23,613 --> 01:01:26,337
And if there's one man on this tour that embodies 

948
01:01:26,337 --> 01:01:30,403
the spirit of rock and roll more than Lemmy, show him to me. 

949
01:01:30,403 --> 01:01:33,170
Ladies and gentlemen, the great man himself, Lemmy! 

950
01:01:33,170 --> 01:01:36,438
GUITAR INTRO 

951
01:01:48,175 --> 01:01:50,061
INAUDIBLE 

952
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:56,181
'The Damned split up 

953
01:01:56,181 --> 01:01:58,906
'and Brian James went off and did other stuff. 

954
01:01:58,906 --> 01:02:03,851
'And we thought, could we possibly have a Damned without Brian?' 

955
01:02:03,851 --> 01:02:06,324
"We need someone who can play base." 

956
01:02:06,324 --> 01:02:10,977
So we asked Lemmy, and he instantly said yes. He would do some gigs with us. 

957
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:13,744
As a laugh, me and Scabby we said, 

958
01:02:13,744 --> 01:02:16,468
"Let's see if he'll play SOS by Abba." 

959
01:02:16,468 --> 01:02:20,996
We thought there was no way in the world, we did it as a joke 

960
01:02:20,996 --> 01:02:23,930
and he said, "Yeah, I'll give that a go." And he played it! 

961
01:02:23,930 --> 01:02:26,192
He played a whole bunch of Damned songs 

962
01:02:26,192 --> 01:02:30,216
and we did one of his, one Motorhead song, we fucking ruined it. 

963
01:02:30,216 --> 01:02:32,354
Yeah, he wasn't pleased about that. 

964
01:02:32,354 --> 01:02:36,336
He said, "I learned all your fucking shitty songs, and you ruined my one." 

965
01:02:36,336 --> 01:02:38,809
One fucking song! You bunch of cunts. 

966
01:02:42,414 --> 01:02:43,671
The great man himself! 

967
01:02:47,403 --> 01:02:51,007
- Killed By Death. 
- Metropolis. 
- Overkill. 
- I Don't Believe A Word. 

968
01:02:51,007 --> 01:02:56,414
Some people might be like, "Killed By Death? That's stupid." I'm like, "No, you're stupid." 

969
01:02:56,414 --> 01:02:59,809
Lemmy is an amazing lyricist, powerful lyricist, smart, sharp. 

970
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:03,247
'The first lyrics are just so twisted, straight in your face.' 

971
01:03:03,247 --> 01:03:06,264
"Don't talk to me, I don't believe a word." 

972
01:03:06,264 --> 01:03:10,205
"But that's the way I like it, baby, I don't want to live for ever." 

973
01:03:10,205 --> 01:03:14,564
I mean, who can say it better, you know? I mean, that is one of the most prolific lines. 

974
01:03:14,564 --> 01:03:18,126
"You win some, you lose some, It's all the same to me." 

975
01:03:18,126 --> 01:03:19,636
I kind of live by that. 

976
01:03:19,636 --> 01:03:21,479
Fuck Keith Richards. 

977
01:03:22,947 --> 01:03:26,887
Fuck all those dudes that fucking, you know... 

978
01:03:26,887 --> 01:03:29,401
That "survived" the Sixties 

979
01:03:29,401 --> 01:03:34,180
and are fucking flying around on Learjets and, you know, 

980
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:39,042
living up their gunslinger reputation as they fuck supermodels 

981
01:03:39,042 --> 01:03:41,599
in the most expensive hotel in Paris. 

982
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:43,820
It's like, "You know what Lemmy's doing?" 

983
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:48,264
Lemmy's probably drinking Jack and cokes and writing another record. 

984
01:03:48,264 --> 01:03:49,773
Two, three, four. 

985
01:03:57,149 --> 01:03:59,622
'One of the lyrics that Lemmy wrote for me was,' 

986
01:03:59,622 --> 01:04:01,216
"Mama, I'm coming home". 

987
01:04:02,599 --> 01:04:06,915
It's really a haunting feeling because I give someone that doesn't know 

988
01:04:06,915 --> 01:04:09,892
what the situation with my wife and I really is... 

989
01:04:09,892 --> 01:04:14,755
'It's kind of spooky when somebody writes a lyric, when you sing that lyric,' 

990
01:04:14,755 --> 01:04:18,275
and you go, "Fucking hell, it's so close to home, you know?" 

991
01:04:18,275 --> 01:04:22,510
Every time I played it on stage, it's like I get a chill up my spine. 

992
01:04:23,808 --> 01:04:26,282
# Just a clown in a one-horse town 

993
01:04:26,282 --> 01:04:29,718
# In broke-down second-hand car 

994
01:04:29,718 --> 01:04:32,065
# Can you still get it up? 

995
01:04:32,065 --> 01:04:33,827
# Or are we pushing too hard? 

996
01:04:34,873 --> 01:04:37,599
# I think if you ever had a beautiful girl 

997
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:39,610
# You had to use your MasterCard. # 

998
01:04:41,747 --> 01:04:43,550
Nah, let's go again. 

999
01:04:45,897 --> 01:04:48,077
# Can you still get it up? 

1000
01:04:48,077 --> 01:04:50,299
# Or are we pushing too hard? 

1001
01:04:50,299 --> 01:04:53,862
# If you wanna get your hands on a beautiful girl 

1002
01:04:53,862 --> 01:04:56,209
# You gotta use a MasterCard. # 

1003
01:04:56,209 --> 01:04:58,850
- Let's listen to what we have, OK? 
- Yeah. 

1004
01:05:03,083 --> 01:05:05,473
They're pills. Oooh! 

1005
01:05:05,473 --> 01:05:06,562
HE LAUGHS 

1006
01:05:09,245 --> 01:05:12,598
- What kind of pills are they? Vitamins? 
- No. 

1007
01:05:15,491 --> 01:05:17,754
Diabetes. And umm... 

1008
01:05:20,059 --> 01:05:21,777
One for... 

1009
01:05:21,777 --> 01:05:23,454
blood pressure, I think. 

1010
01:05:25,718 --> 01:05:28,484
I mean, I told him, "My blood pressure's just fine. 

1011
01:05:28,484 --> 01:05:31,629
"Every time I cut myself, it comes right out." 

1012
01:05:31,629 --> 01:05:33,766
OK, lets hear it. 

1013
01:05:33,766 --> 01:05:36,449
# Or are we pushing too hard? 

1014
01:05:36,449 --> 01:05:39,424
# If you wanna get your hands On a beautiful girl 

1015
01:05:39,424 --> 01:05:41,101
# You gotta use a MasterCard 

1016
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:45,712
# There's no excuse for bullshit 

1017
01:05:45,712 --> 01:05:47,933
# So don't try to feed me none 

1018
01:05:49,442 --> 01:05:52,376
# You better shake some action 

1019
01:05:52,376 --> 01:05:54,137
# Bring it on, bring it on... # 

1020
01:05:54,137 --> 01:05:57,658
We were sitting around talking, and he asked me about a quad injury. 

1021
01:05:57,658 --> 01:06:00,550
I had torn my quad like maybe a year before that. 

1022
01:06:00,550 --> 01:06:05,160
He just, out of nowhere, said, "You know when you tore your quad, did you think that was it? 

1023
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:08,137
"Did you think your career was over? Were you finished?" 

1024
01:06:08,137 --> 01:06:12,789
And I said, "You know, it went through my head a few times, but I just kept going with it." 

1025
01:06:12,789 --> 01:06:17,400
He said, "When they told me I was diabetic and I was really sick with it," 

1026
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,915
which was actually right before he did my song, 

1027
01:06:19,915 --> 01:06:24,987
he said, "At first, I thought, 'I'm done. It's all over.' " 

1028
01:06:26,244 --> 01:06:31,904
Then he said, "I started thinking about it, and what the fuck am I going to do? 

1029
01:06:31,904 --> 01:06:37,058
"I've lived my whole life this way, I've done everything I've done up until now to get to where I'm at. 

1030
01:06:37,058 --> 01:06:38,484
"I'm not going to change." 

1031
01:06:38,484 --> 01:06:41,418
And the quote that always sticks with me, he said, 

1032
01:06:41,418 --> 01:06:45,862
"I do all the stuff that I do drug-wise and drinking-wise and all that stuff, 

1033
01:06:45,862 --> 01:06:48,962
"and at the end of the day, I'm too old to find God now." 

1034
01:06:50,681 --> 01:06:52,693
I'm touring, man. 

1035
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:05,980
'He wanted us to do a couple of songs with him in the studio. 

1036
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:08,957
'He came in there with a bottle of' 

1037
01:07:08,957 --> 01:07:12,309
Maker's Mark Whiskey. 

1038
01:07:12,309 --> 01:07:14,825
And I started drinking with him. 

1039
01:07:14,825 --> 01:07:18,764
'And we didn't really get much done because we were just drinking. 

1040
01:07:18,764 --> 01:07:21,657
And he was like playing guitar and showing me stuff 

1041
01:07:21,657 --> 01:07:25,220
and then we'd start drink, drink, drink, drink, drink. 

1042
01:07:25,220 --> 01:07:26,980
And... 

1043
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:29,495
the next day, I had to go to a hospital. 

1044
01:07:29,495 --> 01:07:31,675
Lemmy gave me alcohol poisoning, 

1045
01:07:31,675 --> 01:07:33,057
basically! 

1046
01:07:33,057 --> 01:07:34,567
'There's Marlboro Reds,' 

1047
01:07:34,567 --> 01:07:38,465
Jack Daniels, speed, strippers and gambling. 

1048
01:07:38,465 --> 01:07:39,848
That's what he likes. 

1049
01:07:39,848 --> 01:07:42,406
'I remember me sitting down with Zakk 

1050
01:07:42,406 --> 01:07:46,220
'and he's showing us Beatle footage and stuff and... 

1051
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:47,896
'he says,' 

1052
01:07:47,896 --> 01:07:51,207
"Do you want a Jack Daniels?" Me and Zakk, "Oh, far out." 

1053
01:07:51,207 --> 01:07:54,351
So, I remember this, he takes out a fifth of Jack Daniels 

1054
01:07:54,351 --> 01:07:56,992
and cracks the seal and then hands it to me, 

1055
01:07:56,992 --> 01:08:00,261
so I take a swig off it and hand it to Zakk. 

1056
01:08:00,261 --> 01:08:03,321
Zakk takes a swig of it, then he goes to hand it back to Lemmy, 

1057
01:08:03,321 --> 01:08:06,507
and Lemmy is opening another fifth for me and another for him. 

1058
01:08:06,507 --> 01:08:08,477
It was like having a beer with the guy! 

1059
01:08:08,477 --> 01:08:13,633
He wanted us to drink the whole fifth like we're drinking a beer. We're like, "Holy shit! No, no, no!" 

1060
01:08:13,633 --> 01:08:17,531
'First time I ever met the guy, he says, "Hello" ' 

1061
01:08:17,531 --> 01:08:22,267
and proceeds to offer me crystal meth. This is a fucking hard-core dude! 

1062
01:08:27,968 --> 01:08:30,649
'I will say this.' 

1063
01:08:30,649 --> 01:08:34,591
I've never ever ever seen Lemmy incapacitated by booze or anything. 

1064
01:08:34,591 --> 01:08:38,195
I have not seen him fall off the stage, 

1065
01:08:38,195 --> 01:08:40,459
I haven't seen him say stupid things, 

1066
01:08:40,459 --> 01:08:43,267
I haven't seen his life crumble because of it. 

1067
01:08:43,267 --> 01:08:48,423
It would be pretty scary, Lemmy completely sober, 

1068
01:08:48,423 --> 01:08:50,056
and on you, man! 

1069
01:08:50,056 --> 01:08:54,039
By the law of average, he should have been dead. 

1070
01:08:54,039 --> 01:08:57,476
I used to hit it really hard, but he's just... I don't know. 

1071
01:08:57,476 --> 01:09:01,458
He's made of fucking iron. 

1072
01:09:03,261 --> 01:09:06,111
I don't really want to advertise all that. 

1073
01:09:06,111 --> 01:09:08,458
I don't want kids to take any drugs cos of me. 

1074
01:09:09,925 --> 01:09:12,440
I don't want them to stay off drugs cos of me, either, 

1075
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:16,757
but I don't want to advertise a lifestyle that killed a lot of my friends. 

1076
01:09:17,889 --> 01:09:19,104
OK? 

1077
01:09:20,278 --> 01:09:22,584
Here's another question for Lemmy. Jose. 

1078
01:09:22,584 --> 01:09:24,177
- 'Yeah. Lemmy?' 
- Yeah. 

1079
01:09:24,177 --> 01:09:26,356
'What do you credit to your longevity? 

1080
01:09:26,356 --> 01:09:29,961
'You drink, smoke, party a lot. I want to know what you credit to it.' 

1081
01:09:29,961 --> 01:09:33,230
Not dying! That's the secret. 

1082
01:09:33,230 --> 01:09:36,164
That's the secret of survival, not dying! 

1083
01:09:36,164 --> 01:09:38,135
I don't know, you know. 

1084
01:09:38,135 --> 01:09:41,949
- I was lucky cos a lot of my friends didn't make it, you know? 
- Yeah. 

1085
01:09:41,949 --> 01:09:46,602
And I did. I never did heroin, you see. That was the one. 

1086
01:09:46,602 --> 01:09:48,949
I never saw anybody die on anything else. 

1087
01:09:48,949 --> 01:09:50,751
When I was about 17-years-old... 

1088
01:09:53,098 --> 01:09:55,194
..he said to me, 

1089
01:09:55,194 --> 01:09:58,044
"Son, promise me that when you grow up, 

1090
01:09:59,595 --> 01:10:02,948
"you know, don't do coke. 

1091
01:10:02,948 --> 01:10:05,087
"Please, just don't do coke." 

1092
01:10:05,087 --> 01:10:07,098
And I was like, "OK, yeah". 

1093
01:10:07,098 --> 01:10:09,948
And he says, "Just do speed. It's much better for you!" 

1094
01:10:15,859 --> 01:10:19,296
When you think back in it, Motorhead was the original thrash band. 

1095
01:10:19,296 --> 01:10:21,350
Everything about them. 

1096
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:24,283
They played fast, it was gnarly, it was a little loose, 

1097
01:10:24,283 --> 01:10:26,547
it had some punk rock, it had metal, 

1098
01:10:26,547 --> 01:10:31,283
it had all the elements that we then later perfected and refined 

1099
01:10:31,283 --> 01:10:36,104
and then we became part of the Big Four of thrash metal. 

1100
01:10:40,463 --> 01:10:44,110
You could definitely say, without Motorhead, there's no Metallica, 

1101
01:10:44,110 --> 01:10:46,917
there's no Anthrax, there's no Megadeath, probably no Slayer. 

1102
01:10:46,917 --> 01:10:50,691
There could have been those bands, like Anthrax lite or something. 

1103
01:11:01,463 --> 01:11:05,780
Man, influenced me big time, as a bass player. Big, big, bit time 

1104
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:08,966
because of the levels of distortion. 

1105
01:11:08,966 --> 01:11:11,649
The speed of it all, like, the power of it all 

1106
01:11:11,649 --> 01:11:13,828
and the relentlessness of it. 

1107
01:11:13,828 --> 01:11:17,474
I can't even begin to say how much of an influence 

1108
01:11:17,474 --> 01:11:19,319
Motorhead have been on us, 

1109
01:11:19,319 --> 01:11:23,218
on a bunch of different levels. 

1110
01:11:23,218 --> 01:11:26,193
I'll give you a list of things that were lifted from Lemmy. 

1111
01:11:26,193 --> 01:11:29,379
- Musical level. 
- Singing style. 

1112
01:11:29,379 --> 01:11:34,619
You know, lyric phrasing, the simplicity, the rhyming. The scheme of it all. 

1113
01:11:34,619 --> 01:11:35,959
Attitude. 

1114
01:11:35,959 --> 01:11:37,636
Trying to be as cool as Lemmy. 

1115
01:11:37,636 --> 01:11:42,833
Motivation and perseverance. Er... The look. 

1116
01:11:42,833 --> 01:11:45,265
I mean, his facial hair, in the early days for me, 

1117
01:11:45,265 --> 01:11:46,565
was certainly all about that. 

1118
01:11:46,565 --> 01:11:48,408
The bullet belt, come on! 

1119
01:11:48,408 --> 01:11:52,265
Lemmy, to me, is not just an inspiration, 

1120
01:11:52,265 --> 01:11:56,833
but I think he's kind of like the OK sign. You know? 

1121
01:11:56,833 --> 01:12:00,271
It's OK to go this far, it's OK to do this. 

1122
01:12:00,271 --> 01:12:04,715
It's like he's kicked the door open for a lot of bands 

1123
01:12:04,715 --> 01:12:06,894
that were feeling like they wanted more. 

1124
01:12:09,870 --> 01:12:12,677
HE PLAYS RIFF FROM ACE OF SPADES 

1125
01:12:12,677 --> 01:12:14,690
ATTEMPTS HIGHPITCHED VOCALS 

1126
01:12:14,690 --> 01:12:17,749
- COUGHS 
- I can't sing that bit. 

1127
01:12:17,749 --> 01:12:20,012
I'm like the opposite. 

1128
01:12:21,061 --> 01:12:22,779
I have to sing down here. 

1129
01:12:22,779 --> 01:12:24,078
You like it lower? 

1130
01:12:24,078 --> 01:12:25,169
Yeah. 

1131
01:12:27,768 --> 01:12:31,707
- SCOTTISH ACCENT: 
- # You take the high mic and I'll take the low mic... # 

1132
01:12:57,612 --> 01:13:02,055
- What's up, motherfuckers? 
- Hello, sir. Good to see you, brother. 

1133
01:13:02,055 --> 01:13:03,899
Good to see you too. 

1134
01:13:03,899 --> 01:13:07,252
- Hey, man. What's happening? 
- Hey, Lemmy. How you doing, bro? 

1135
01:13:07,252 --> 01:13:09,138
Good. 

1136
01:13:11,402 --> 01:13:15,341
What do you want to do? I'll do the first one and you do the second one? 

1137
01:13:15,341 --> 01:13:18,947
- Yeah. 
- Do the third one together or something? 
- Sure. 
- Or one each? 

1138
01:13:18,947 --> 01:13:21,294
You do the high harmony? 

1139
01:13:21,294 --> 01:13:24,815
No. Not any more, no! 

1140
01:13:24,815 --> 01:13:27,707
I'll grab your balls and you go, "Ahhhh!" 

1141
01:13:27,707 --> 01:13:30,180
That's the theory, yeah! 

1142
01:13:30,180 --> 01:13:33,742
What ending do you have for Damage Case? 

1143
01:13:33,742 --> 01:13:36,886
He stops and I stop and then... 

1144
01:13:36,886 --> 01:13:40,156
- And then you're the last.... 
- How? 

1145
01:13:40,156 --> 01:13:44,431
Don't be under any illusion that we know what we're doing. 

1146
01:13:44,431 --> 01:13:46,821
Let's see what happens, let's have fun with it. 

1147
01:13:46,821 --> 01:13:49,964
It's a freak-out! It goes, one, two, three... 

1148
01:14:12,389 --> 01:14:14,737
Is it time to go home yet? 

1149
01:14:14,737 --> 01:14:16,204
AUDIENCE: No! 

1150
01:14:16,204 --> 01:14:17,880
I didn't think so. 

1151
01:14:20,982 --> 01:14:27,143
You can see there's an extra amp up on stage here. 

1152
01:14:27,143 --> 01:14:29,574
We have the distinct pleasure 

1153
01:14:29,574 --> 01:14:33,431
of inviting on stage with us 

1154
01:14:33,431 --> 01:14:35,904
one of our all-time idols. 

1155
01:14:35,904 --> 01:14:38,964
And I know the reason 

1156
01:14:38,964 --> 01:14:44,120
that Lars is so into music...right? 

1157
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:48,311
He followed him around, pestered him forever, 

1158
01:14:48,311 --> 01:14:50,112
I think he even threw up on him, 

1159
01:14:50,112 --> 01:14:52,251
something like that. 

1160
01:14:53,885 --> 01:14:57,700
Lars is the biggest Motorhead fan on the planet. 

1161
01:15:00,005 --> 01:15:05,035
And here's the godfather of heavy metal. 

1162
01:15:05,035 --> 01:15:10,108
From Motorhead, the one and only Lemmy Kilmister! 

1163
01:15:10,108 --> 01:15:11,867
CHEERING 

1164
01:15:19,832 --> 01:15:24,275
Lemmy, Lemmy, Lemmy, Lemmy! 

1165
01:15:24,275 --> 01:15:27,963
CROWD: Lemmy! Lemmy! Lemmy! Lemmy! 

1166
01:15:27,963 --> 01:15:30,897
All right. 

1167
01:15:48,921 --> 01:15:51,897
# Hey, babe, don't act so scared 

1168
01:15:51,897 --> 01:15:54,538
# All I want is some special care 

1169
01:15:54,538 --> 01:15:58,058
# On the run from some institution 

1170
01:15:58,058 --> 01:16:00,615
# All I need's a little consolation 

1171
01:16:00,615 --> 01:16:03,256
# And I can tell by his face 

1172
01:16:03,256 --> 01:16:06,066
# I'm all over the place 

1173
01:16:06,066 --> 01:16:09,124
# Put me inside this place 

1174
01:16:09,124 --> 01:16:11,807
# Move over for a damaged case 

1175
01:16:18,387 --> 01:16:20,567
# Hey, baby, don't act so scared 

1176
01:16:20,567 --> 01:16:23,418
# All I want is some special care 

1177
01:16:23,418 --> 01:16:26,352
# I ain't lookin' to victimise you 

1178
01:16:26,352 --> 01:16:29,035
# All I want to do is tantalise you 

1179
01:16:29,035 --> 01:16:31,424
# And I can tell by your face 

1180
01:16:31,424 --> 01:16:34,274
# That I'm all over the place 

1181
01:16:34,274 --> 01:16:37,334
# I'm a total disgrace 

1182
01:16:37,334 --> 01:16:40,184
# Move over for a damaged case 

1183
01:16:44,963 --> 01:16:46,052
# Move over! 

1184
01:17:25,201 --> 01:17:28,135
# Hey, babe, don't turn away 

1185
01:17:28,135 --> 01:17:30,567
# I'm here tomorrow, gone today 

1186
01:17:30,567 --> 01:17:33,753
# I ain't lookin' to victimise you 

1187
01:17:33,753 --> 01:17:36,980
# All I want to do is tantalise you 

1188
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:40,082
# I can tell by your face 

1189
01:17:40,082 --> 01:17:42,345
# I'm all over the place 

1190
01:17:42,345 --> 01:17:44,943
# I'm all over the place 

1191
01:17:44,943 --> 01:17:47,627
# Move over for a damaged case 

1192
01:18:43,292 --> 01:18:44,673
# Damaged case! # 

1193
01:18:45,764 --> 01:18:49,368
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE 

1194
01:18:53,518 --> 01:18:54,901
Good job, man. 

1195
01:18:57,207 --> 01:19:01,147
Thanks. Good job, good job. 

1196
01:19:01,147 --> 01:19:03,326
Yeah! 

1197
01:19:07,266 --> 01:19:11,123
Lemmy! Lemmy! Lemmy! 

1198
01:19:11,123 --> 01:19:13,972
AUDIENCE: Lemmy! Lemmy! Lemmy! 

1199
01:19:16,529 --> 01:19:20,387
TV: 'Oh, Stacey, you dropped your pom-pom in the water. 

1200
01:19:20,387 --> 01:19:23,109
- 'I'll get it for you.' 
- 'I'll come with you'. 
- 'Me too'. 

1201
01:19:23,109 --> 01:19:26,967
'Wait a minute, we don't want to get our sweaters all wet. 

1202
01:19:26,967 --> 01:19:29,524
'Better take 'em off. Splash fight!' 

1203
01:19:56,392 --> 01:19:59,955
At one point, I hadn't seen Lemmy or the boys for a decade or whatever, 

1204
01:19:59,955 --> 01:20:04,482
and I wanted to do a show with them. And surprise, surprise, 

1205
01:20:04,482 --> 01:20:08,337
the same dudes are on the crew as when I toured with them in the '80s. 

1206
01:20:08,337 --> 01:20:11,440
And here it's the '90s and they go "Hey, how are you doing?" 

1207
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:14,121
I'm like "holy crap". But this is Lemmy. 

1208
01:20:15,673 --> 01:20:19,319
It was just like a big family thing, without getting too cliched. 

1209
01:20:19,319 --> 01:20:21,876
We love each other, we hate each other, 

1210
01:20:21,876 --> 01:20:23,930
we love to hate each other. 

1211
01:20:23,930 --> 01:20:26,194
We've done a tour, gone home, come back. 

1212
01:20:26,194 --> 01:20:29,799
The first time you see them again, it just feels tight. 

1213
01:20:29,799 --> 01:20:34,284
There's not that band/group thing with this lot, they're just friends. 

1214
01:20:40,067 --> 01:20:42,918
It's fucking great. What other job can you get paid 

1215
01:20:42,918 --> 01:20:44,888
for travelling around the world, 

1216
01:20:44,888 --> 01:20:48,954
meeting great fucking amazing people and seeing Motorhead every night? 

1217
01:21:10,667 --> 01:21:14,480
# Happy birthday to you 

1218
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:18,756
# Happy birthday to you 

1219
01:21:18,756 --> 01:21:22,403
# Happy birthday, dear Roger 

1220
01:21:22,403 --> 01:21:27,433
# Happy birthday to you! # 

1221
01:21:29,277 --> 01:21:31,499
Eat your cake! 

1222
01:21:31,499 --> 01:21:34,098
A year older now. 

1223
01:21:35,396 --> 01:21:38,583
What I've seen in rock'n'roll bands that I've been in, 

1224
01:21:38,583 --> 01:21:40,468
yeah, the money comes into play 

1225
01:21:40,468 --> 01:21:42,229
and then attitudes change 

1226
01:21:42,229 --> 01:21:45,247
and they fucking want to act like a rock star. 

1227
01:21:45,247 --> 01:21:50,319
Motorhead doesn't do that. Motorhead's in it for the music. 

1228
01:21:50,319 --> 01:21:52,164
Motorhead's in it for the fans. 

1229
01:21:53,755 --> 01:21:56,145
# Well, we came up from the gutter 

1230
01:21:56,145 --> 01:21:59,415
# Wrong side of the tracks... # 

1231
01:22:01,174 --> 01:22:03,354
They still have the goal, you know, 

1232
01:22:03,354 --> 01:22:05,366
to move this band forward 

1233
01:22:05,366 --> 01:22:11,277
and to sound the best and be able to, you know, write good records. 

1234
01:22:11,277 --> 01:22:13,834
There's no faking going on here. 

1235
01:22:13,834 --> 01:22:17,815
I used to say there's not a fake bone in Lem's body, 

1236
01:22:17,815 --> 01:22:20,205
and that really is true. 

1237
01:22:20,205 --> 01:22:23,642
I could say the same for Phil and myself as well. 

1238
01:22:23,642 --> 01:22:30,097
We're not faking through year after year, you know, pretending, 

1239
01:22:30,097 --> 01:22:35,085
and I think that is reflecting out, you know. 

1240
01:22:35,085 --> 01:22:38,479
It's like an aura around us, I suppose. 

1241
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:51,139
We've had quite a few people tell us that our music got them 

1242
01:22:51,139 --> 01:22:54,156
through particularly low times in their lives. 

1243
01:22:54,156 --> 01:22:56,084
It does something to us when we play. 

1244
01:22:56,084 --> 01:22:57,845
For some reason, it's great. 

1245
01:22:57,845 --> 01:23:01,827
I don't know what it is we do, but it gives a good feeling. 

1246
01:23:01,827 --> 01:23:03,922
I guess it's the same for the fans. 

1247
01:23:18,006 --> 01:23:20,228
I asked him for his autograph when I was 12. 

1248
01:23:20,228 --> 01:23:23,289
He came to my home town with Hawkwind, and he was the only one 

1249
01:23:23,289 --> 01:23:25,216
that came out to sign autographs. 

1250
01:23:25,216 --> 01:23:27,689
If somebody had said then that I'd be in a band 

1251
01:23:27,689 --> 01:23:31,713
with this guy for a quarter of a century, a big rock band, 

1252
01:23:31,713 --> 01:23:33,431
I'd have said, "Come on". 

1253
01:23:33,431 --> 01:23:35,484
It's a good story to tell, 

1254
01:23:35,484 --> 01:23:38,419
because it's inspiring. Anything can happen. 

1255
01:23:38,419 --> 01:23:42,400
MUSIC DROWNS LYRICS 

1256
01:23:44,958 --> 01:23:47,054
MUSIC STOPS 

1257
01:23:47,054 --> 01:23:49,568
Fucking microphone. What's the point? 

1258
01:23:49,568 --> 01:23:50,659
FEEDBACK WHINE 

1259
01:23:50,659 --> 01:23:52,125
Listen to it. 

1260
01:23:52,125 --> 01:23:55,186
Didn't you know it was doing that all afternoon? 

1261
01:23:55,186 --> 01:23:57,030
Has nobody tested it before? 

1262
01:23:57,030 --> 01:23:59,587
I've done a few gigs with Motorhead 

1263
01:23:59,587 --> 01:24:01,557
and done a sound check with him. 

1264
01:24:01,557 --> 01:24:04,701
It's so fucking loud, you really can't do much. 

1265
01:24:04,701 --> 01:24:07,425
So there's a lot of yelling going on. 

1266
01:24:07,425 --> 01:24:11,826
One! Two! Three! 

1267
01:24:11,826 --> 01:24:14,719
- Perfect, just a bit more. 
- An ear doctor would be amazed 

1268
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:16,940
at just how well Lemmy can hear, 

1269
01:24:16,940 --> 01:24:19,832
considering the abuse he gives his ears. 

1270
01:24:19,832 --> 01:24:22,179
There's one thing about Lemmy - 

1271
01:24:22,179 --> 01:24:25,617
he'll always hear you if you offer him a drink. 

1272
01:24:25,617 --> 01:24:27,461
Even if you walk up behind him. 

1273
01:24:31,233 --> 01:24:34,963
The loudest band in the world in the Guinness Book of Records. 

1274
01:24:34,963 --> 01:24:36,557
That's what people want. 

1275
01:24:36,557 --> 01:24:40,329
They want it loud, they want it fast. They want it...Lemmy. 

1276
01:24:40,329 --> 01:24:42,802
- Is it loud enough? 
- CROWD: No! 

1277
01:24:42,802 --> 01:24:46,365
- You want it louder? 
- Yes! 
- Are you sure about this? 

1278
01:24:46,365 --> 01:24:50,137
This is called Killers. 

1279
01:25:02,377 --> 01:25:06,107
I remember when we went in to record Power, Corruption And Lies 

1280
01:25:06,107 --> 01:25:08,538
in Britannia Row in Islington in London. 

1281
01:25:08,538 --> 01:25:13,274
And the people that had been in before us hadn't - 

1282
01:25:13,274 --> 01:25:17,886
you're supposed to level the desk when you leave. 

1283
01:25:17,886 --> 01:25:21,742
You take the strip off, and you level the desk, put it back to how it was. 

1284
01:25:21,742 --> 01:25:25,053
And they hadn't done it, presumably because it was late 

1285
01:25:25,053 --> 01:25:26,478
when they finished. 

1286
01:25:26,478 --> 01:25:28,742
And I said, "Rotten fuckers. Who was it?" 

1287
01:25:28,742 --> 01:25:32,179
They went, "It was Motorhead". I was like "Oh, fucking great!" 

1288
01:25:32,179 --> 01:25:36,705
So we put my bass through his channels on the desk, 

1289
01:25:36,705 --> 01:25:38,172
and it sounded shit. 

1290
01:25:45,885 --> 01:25:49,323
# Another time, another place Another girl... # 

1291
01:25:49,323 --> 01:25:52,214
When I think of Motorhead, I don't think subtlety. 

1292
01:25:52,214 --> 01:25:54,561
It makes me think of a door blown open. 

1293
01:25:54,561 --> 01:25:59,633
His voice is a rasp. It's like eating fucking nails. 

1294
01:25:59,633 --> 01:26:02,484
It's kind of more like a wind coming at you. 

1295
01:26:02,484 --> 01:26:06,256
It's like someone coming up behind me and spanking my ears. 

1296
01:26:06,256 --> 01:26:08,309
Everything starts going grainy. 

1297
01:26:08,309 --> 01:26:11,621
It's like being in a sandstorm, basically, that's it. 

1298
01:26:11,621 --> 01:26:15,017
It's the aural equivalent of being in a sandstorm, I would say. 

1299
01:26:15,017 --> 01:26:18,537
When the lights go down and that motherfucker hits the stage 

1300
01:26:18,537 --> 01:26:23,274
and he blows the cigarette out of his mouth, it's game over, man. 

1301
01:26:23,274 --> 01:26:27,088
You could drag anybody to a Motorhead show, and they're gonna go... 

1302
01:26:27,088 --> 01:26:29,771
INTRO: "Ace Of Spades" 

1303
01:26:39,202 --> 01:26:42,807
# If you like to gamble, I'm your man 

1304
01:26:42,807 --> 01:26:47,334
# Win some, lose some It's all the same to me 

1305
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:57,854
# The pleasure is to play Makes no difference what you say 

1306
01:27:01,417 --> 01:27:06,489
# I don't share your greed, the only card I need is the ace of spades 

1307
01:27:06,489 --> 01:27:08,668
# The ace of spades 

1308
01:27:11,896 --> 01:27:15,417
# Going for the higher one Dancing with the devil 

1309
01:27:15,417 --> 01:27:19,651
# Going with the flow It's all a game to me 

1310
01:27:26,273 --> 01:27:31,346
# Seven or eleven Snake eyes watching you 

1311
01:27:33,525 --> 01:27:38,346
# Double up or quit, double stake or split, the ace of spades 

1312
01:27:38,346 --> 01:27:40,231
# The ace of spades 

1313
01:27:47,273 --> 01:27:51,884
# You know I'm born to lose and gambling's for fools 

1314
01:27:51,884 --> 01:27:55,740
# But that's the way I like it, baby, I don't want to live forever 

1315
01:28:30,321 --> 01:28:32,122
# Pushing up the ante 

1316
01:28:32,122 --> 01:28:33,758
# I know you want to see me 

1317
01:28:33,758 --> 01:28:37,698
# Read 'em and weep the dead man's hand again 

1318
01:28:44,572 --> 01:28:48,512
# I see it in your eyes Take one look and die 

1319
01:28:51,908 --> 01:28:56,728
# The only thing you see, you know it's gonna be the ace of spades 

1320
01:28:56,728 --> 01:28:58,697
# The ace of spades. # 

1321
01:29:16,763 --> 01:29:18,942
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE 

1322
01:29:18,942 --> 01:29:20,243
Thank you kindly. 

1323
01:30:09,744 --> 01:30:13,810
TV: '..Next election, I'm gonna run against you, and I'm gonna win.' 

1324
01:30:13,810 --> 01:30:16,995
'All right, Mrs Griffin. You want to take me on? Fine. 

1325
01:30:16,995 --> 01:30:20,475
- 'But if you plan to beat me, you'll have to...' 
- 'What is it?' 

1326
01:30:20,475 --> 01:30:23,535
'A bee just flew in through the window. Don't move.' 

1327
01:30:25,715 --> 01:30:27,349
'Hmm, now look who's mayor. 

1328
01:30:27,349 --> 01:30:30,409
'First order of business - free honey for everyone! 

1329
01:30:30,409 --> 01:30:35,607
'Yay, Mayor Bee, Mayor Bee, Mayor Bee - ow! Oh, done stung myself.' 

1330
01:30:42,985 --> 01:30:46,589
# Lucky there's a family guy 

1331
01:30:46,589 --> 01:30:49,816
# Lucky there's a man who positively can do 

1332
01:30:49,816 --> 01:30:53,127
# All the things that make us Laugh and cry 

1333
01:30:53,127 --> 01:30:58,702
# He's...a...fam...ily...guy! # 

1334
01:31:17,901 --> 01:31:21,127
Everything about Lemmy's playing sets him apart 

1335
01:31:21,127 --> 01:31:25,402
from other bass players, or for that matter any other musicians. 

1336
01:31:25,402 --> 01:31:29,134
The biggest thing is the Rickenbacker and the Marshalls. 

1337
01:31:30,348 --> 01:31:34,665
That's the sound I've never heard anybody create on bass. 

1338
01:31:34,665 --> 01:31:38,690
And he plays it a lot like some heavy metal guitar players. 

1339
01:31:38,690 --> 01:31:43,343
He doesn't play guitar on bass, but it almost sounds like a guitar. 

1340
01:31:45,019 --> 01:31:48,497
The basic difference is that most bass players sound like this. 

1341
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:54,953
Whereas I... 

1342
01:32:01,157 --> 01:32:03,630
..sound quite different. 

1343
01:32:03,630 --> 01:32:06,019
AMPLIFIED SOUND 

1344
01:32:45,965 --> 01:32:47,054
Like that. 

1345
01:32:47,054 --> 01:32:52,252
I always wanted that sound, but I didn't necessarily know it then. 

1346
01:32:52,252 --> 01:32:54,012
It evolves, you know. 

1347
01:32:54,012 --> 01:32:56,024
- What would you say, Tim? 
- What's that? 

1348
01:32:56,024 --> 01:32:59,881
How would you say my bass playing encapsulates my personality 

1349
01:32:59,881 --> 01:33:04,617
and my outlook on life generally, in the modern 21st century? 

1350
01:33:04,617 --> 01:33:07,719
- The phrase "hammer and tongs" comes to mind. 
- Really? 
- Yeah. 

1351
01:33:07,719 --> 01:33:12,036
- Not a hammer, an anvil. 
- Anvil and tongs. 

1352
01:33:12,036 --> 01:33:15,221
And hammer. Stuff like that. 

1353
01:33:15,221 --> 01:33:16,646
Very hard. 

1354
01:33:16,646 --> 01:33:21,258
BOTH TALK AT ONCE 

1355
01:33:21,258 --> 01:33:26,120
Actually, he talks one thing that's in one ear and out the other. 

1356
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:29,809
And nobody ever fucking understands a thing he's saying. 

1357
01:33:29,809 --> 01:33:32,994
Actually, we're two geezers trying to get along backstage. 

1358
01:33:32,994 --> 01:33:36,808
- And everything like that. 
- And things like that. 
- Or something else. 

1359
01:33:36,808 --> 01:33:39,825
Americans usually have a nervous breakdown around now. 

1360
01:33:46,324 --> 01:33:48,880
He's dead, isn't he? 

1361
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:51,227
How do you sell a deaf guy a frog? 

1362
01:33:51,227 --> 01:33:52,401
How? 

1363
01:33:52,401 --> 01:33:54,413
DO YOU WANT TO BUY A FROG? 

1364
01:34:03,802 --> 01:34:06,108
Is it still as fun as it used to be 

1365
01:34:06,108 --> 01:34:09,336
to go around the world and play concerts? 

1366
01:34:09,336 --> 01:34:13,988
Yeah, you know, it's a great job. I recommend it. 

1367
01:34:13,988 --> 01:34:17,802
It's almost as good as being a TV interviewer. 

1368
01:34:17,802 --> 01:34:23,000
- Are there a lot of groupies backstage? 
- Do you see any? 

1369
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,263
What makes you the proudest in your career? 

1370
01:34:27,275 --> 01:34:28,699
Survival, I think. 

1371
01:34:28,699 --> 01:34:31,257
Every year that goes by, I get a bit prouder, 

1372
01:34:31,257 --> 01:34:34,066
because we've proved that we weren't the trash band 

1373
01:34:34,066 --> 01:34:36,748
that they said we were originally. 

1374
01:34:36,748 --> 01:34:39,011
And every year we've survived 

1375
01:34:39,011 --> 01:34:43,370
proves it a little bit more, you know. 

1376
01:34:43,370 --> 01:34:45,467
You know, like that. 

1377
01:34:45,467 --> 01:34:50,161
What keeps you going for 30 years? What keeps you going and going? 

1378
01:34:50,161 --> 01:34:53,891
You have a dream when you're a kid. 

1379
01:34:53,891 --> 01:34:58,502
And my dream came true, so why stop it? 

1380
01:35:01,436 --> 01:35:05,544
Until 2047. Then I might slow down a bit. 

1381
01:35:05,544 --> 01:35:07,639
It might be 2048, I don't know. 

1382
01:35:10,699 --> 01:35:14,178
I love everything about Lemmy. The music, fucking everything. 

1383
01:35:14,178 --> 01:35:16,903
There's nothing not to like about Motorhead. 

1384
01:35:16,903 --> 01:35:18,664
It's a band that's got it all. 

1385
01:35:18,664 --> 01:35:21,639
They're hardcore, a proper hardcore band. 

1386
01:35:21,639 --> 01:35:25,622
They don't like sax and all that shit, they're excellent. 

1387
01:35:25,622 --> 01:35:28,053
They're full on, they've always been full on. 

1388
01:35:28,053 --> 01:35:31,070
Motorhead set the standard for all the others to follow. 

1389
01:35:31,070 --> 01:35:33,795
Every time you see 'em live, they make you deaf. 

1390
01:35:33,795 --> 01:35:37,485
I don't have to listen to my wife. 

1391
01:35:37,485 --> 01:35:42,848
For about five days out of every year, my wife is totally ignored. 

1392
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:46,202
"Oh, sorry, darling, I can't hear you. I can't hear you. 

1393
01:35:46,202 --> 01:35:48,005
"Sorry, I just can't hear you". 

1394
01:35:48,005 --> 01:35:51,359
They've made me stone deaf forever! 

1395
01:36:02,089 --> 01:36:05,651
# Rock'n'roll will save your soul And I got it 

1396
01:36:05,651 --> 01:36:08,334
# Give it to me loud and free 

1397
01:36:08,334 --> 01:36:10,555
# Don't knock it 

1398
01:36:10,555 --> 01:36:13,867
# Let me hear till the end of time 

1399
01:36:13,867 --> 01:36:15,711
# It's the only way 

1400
01:36:15,711 --> 01:36:19,065
# Send shivers up and down your spine 

1401
01:36:19,065 --> 01:36:20,238
# You can't stop it 

1402
01:36:20,238 --> 01:36:24,262
# I'm tellin' you one more time 

1403
01:36:24,262 --> 01:36:28,412
# It ain't no crime Rock it 

1404
01:36:31,597 --> 01:36:33,944
# It's the only way to fly 

1405
01:36:33,944 --> 01:36:35,160
# I gotta have it 

1406
01:36:35,160 --> 01:36:38,471
# Break through, gonna break you too 

1407
01:36:38,471 --> 01:36:40,567
# You better grab it 

1408
01:36:40,567 --> 01:36:43,711
# Let me hear it till the end of time 

1409
01:36:43,711 --> 01:36:45,429
# It's the only way 

1410
01:36:45,429 --> 01:36:48,699
# It'll stop you on a dime 

1411
01:36:48,699 --> 01:36:53,435
# You can't stop it I'm telling you one more time 

1412
01:36:53,435 --> 01:36:55,154
# It ain't no crime 

1413
01:36:55,154 --> 01:36:57,585
# Rock it 

1414
01:37:47,967 --> 01:37:51,446
# Rock'n'roll music gonna stop the world 

1415
01:37:51,446 --> 01:37:52,913
# Can't lose it 

1416
01:37:52,913 --> 01:37:57,902
# It'll make your toenails curl You can't defuse it 

1417
01:37:57,902 --> 01:38:00,584
# Let me hear it all the time 

1418
01:38:00,584 --> 01:38:03,183
# It's the only way 

1419
01:38:03,183 --> 01:38:05,991
# Gonna make you feel all right 

1420
01:38:05,991 --> 01:38:08,590
# You can't excuse it 

1421
01:38:08,590 --> 01:38:11,105
# I'm telling you one more time 

1422
01:38:11,105 --> 01:38:14,040
# It ain't no crime Rock it 

1423
01:38:15,799 --> 01:38:18,567
# Rock it Rock it... # 

1424
01:38:42,375 --> 01:38:44,763
That's all right. 

1425
01:38:44,763 --> 01:38:48,285
It's the biggest thing that's ever happened to me. 

1426
01:38:48,285 --> 01:38:50,924
It's huge. I love that guy. 

1427
01:38:50,924 --> 01:38:55,158
- He's so much nicer than I thought he would be. 
- Why's that? 

1428
01:38:55,158 --> 01:38:56,542
Oh, he's really humble. 

1429
01:38:56,542 --> 01:38:59,182
I thought he would be like, "I don't give a shit". 

1430
01:38:59,182 --> 01:39:03,877
But when I said "Your music really means something to me," 

1431
01:39:03,877 --> 01:39:06,349
he looked at me and said, "Thank you." 

1432
01:39:06,349 --> 01:39:08,697
That really means something to me. 

1433
01:39:18,128 --> 01:39:20,349
If you look at him, he's probably very intimidating, 

1434
01:39:20,349 --> 01:39:22,697
but this is one of the nicest guys you could ever meet. 

1435
01:39:22,697 --> 01:39:26,093
There's so many people that hit him for stuff, 

1436
01:39:26,093 --> 01:39:27,602
and just look at him. 

1437
01:39:27,602 --> 01:39:30,577
Most people in his position would not pay attention 

1438
01:39:30,577 --> 01:39:34,391
to these things. This is a guy who'd go out of his way to help anybody. 

1439
01:39:34,391 --> 01:39:36,027
You just see it in his heart. 

1440
01:39:36,027 --> 01:39:40,428
When I was married before and we were all on the road together, 

1441
01:39:40,428 --> 01:39:46,589
my husband at the time was from Indiana, this redneck kid, 

1442
01:39:46,589 --> 01:39:49,398
idolised Lemmy. Huge Motorhead fan. 

1443
01:39:49,398 --> 01:39:51,955
So we were on tour with Motorhead, 

1444
01:39:51,955 --> 01:39:55,685
and me and Lemmy immediately had this connection, 

1445
01:39:55,685 --> 01:39:58,787
and my marriage was heavily on the rocks. 

1446
01:40:01,594 --> 01:40:05,284
Lemmy...my husband wouldn't talk to him or anything, 

1447
01:40:05,284 --> 01:40:06,877
and Lemmy would just come up 

1448
01:40:06,877 --> 01:40:09,643
with T-shirts and be like "Hey, Matt", you know? 

1449
01:40:09,643 --> 01:40:14,170
And when we actually separated, he was telling all these people 

1450
01:40:14,170 --> 01:40:16,517
in the town we're from, Athens, Georgia, 

1451
01:40:16,517 --> 01:40:17,733
a very small town, 

1452
01:40:17,733 --> 01:40:21,756
that me and Lemmy were having this affair, blah, blah, blah. 

1453
01:40:21,756 --> 01:40:25,780
Eight months later, he died. 

1454
01:40:25,780 --> 01:40:28,044
But when I was going through 

1455
01:40:28,044 --> 01:40:31,398
all of his things that his mother gave me, 

1456
01:40:31,398 --> 01:40:36,050
I found a letter from Lemmy, and he had written him a letter 

1457
01:40:36,050 --> 01:40:42,128
saying, you know, "I know at one point, you really liked my band, 

1458
01:40:42,128 --> 01:40:44,894
"and just so that you know for the record, 

1459
01:40:44,894 --> 01:40:47,326
"Corey and I are really good friends. 

1460
01:40:47,326 --> 01:40:49,840
"There's mutual love and respect there. 

1461
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:53,822
"She did nothing but talk about how much she loved you 

1462
01:40:53,822 --> 01:40:58,181
"and I would never cross that line, I'm not that type of man." 

1463
01:40:58,181 --> 01:41:02,121
And it was just so cute, because when you read the letter, 

1464
01:41:02,121 --> 01:41:05,852
it was like, "I know that at one time, you liked me and my band," 

1465
01:41:05,852 --> 01:41:08,158
and it's Lemmy and fucking Motorhead. 

1466
01:41:08,158 --> 01:41:13,020
It's so bizarre, but he wrote this beautiful letter to him, 

1467
01:41:13,020 --> 01:41:17,086
with the red candle wax and the stamp on the back, 

1468
01:41:17,086 --> 01:41:18,635
and sent it to him, you know? 

1469
01:41:18,635 --> 01:41:21,025
That type of shit, man. 

1470
01:41:21,025 --> 01:41:24,672
It's like, he's a very honourable, 

1471
01:41:24,672 --> 01:41:27,438
generous, good, good man. 

1472
01:41:27,438 --> 01:41:31,253
He's very much a complex emotional person, 

1473
01:41:31,253 --> 01:41:35,318
but there is a kind of distance that he's purposefully put in. 

1474
01:41:35,318 --> 01:41:36,953
Do you know what I mean? 

1475
01:41:36,953 --> 01:41:42,528
I think a lot of that, from what he tells me, is from his youth. 

1476
01:41:45,043 --> 01:41:49,486
He's always had to look out for himself, and he's realised 

1477
01:41:49,486 --> 01:41:54,013
that 90% of the time, the only person he can depend on is himself. 

1478
01:41:54,013 --> 01:41:57,450
Tell me about the people who've been most important in your life? 

1479
01:41:57,450 --> 01:42:01,055
My mother, obviously, because she brought me up on her own. 

1480
01:42:01,055 --> 01:42:05,583
And my granny, for filling in during the day. They were really important. 

1481
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:09,815
They really tainted my outlook on things, 

1482
01:42:09,815 --> 01:42:16,731
because being brought up by two women is different from having the big, heavy husband in the house. 

1483
01:42:16,731 --> 01:42:20,336
So I never got the, "Let's go out and kill some small furry animals." 

1484
01:42:20,336 --> 01:42:23,396
I never had that shit going on. 

1485
01:42:23,396 --> 01:42:25,031
I just never missed a father 

1486
01:42:25,031 --> 01:42:28,090
because I never had one, you know, so I didn't care. 

1487
01:42:28,090 --> 01:42:31,654
He was just a miserable little dickhead with glasses, 

1488
01:42:31,654 --> 01:42:34,461
and all he ever did for me was walk out on me. 

1489
01:42:34,461 --> 01:42:38,192
I think I understand women a lot better than some guys do, 

1490
01:42:38,192 --> 01:42:41,127
because women want the same things as guys do, 

1491
01:42:41,127 --> 01:42:43,599
they just don't want them for as long. 

1492
01:42:43,599 --> 01:42:48,461
Guys want the quick fuck in the alley all their lives, 

1493
01:42:48,461 --> 01:42:52,024
whereas girls get tired of that pretty quick. They want security, 

1494
01:42:52,024 --> 01:42:54,246
meaning you have to give up everything 

1495
01:42:54,246 --> 01:42:56,383
that might be a risk to that security, 

1496
01:42:56,383 --> 01:42:58,103
which is why I'm not married. 

1497
01:42:58,103 --> 01:43:01,792
My dad once went out with a woman that he really fell in love with 

1498
01:43:01,792 --> 01:43:04,766
when he was very young. He must have been about 17. 

1499
01:43:04,766 --> 01:43:11,180
And...this girl died of a heroin overdose. 

1500
01:43:11,180 --> 01:43:14,491
My dad is anti-heroin. 

1501
01:43:14,491 --> 01:43:19,144
He will not have anything to do with someone who is on smack. 

1502
01:43:19,144 --> 01:43:22,120
But I think it's because of this girl, 

1503
01:43:22,120 --> 01:43:24,929
because he really loved this girl. 

1504
01:43:24,929 --> 01:43:30,922
And he found her in the bathtub. He found her dead in the tub. 

1505
01:43:30,922 --> 01:43:35,827
And I think that, as I can recall, 

1506
01:43:35,827 --> 01:43:39,557
he sat in an armchair for, like, three days. 

1507
01:43:39,557 --> 01:43:44,000
He hasn't been able to feel the same way about any other woman 

1508
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,383
since that woman. 

1509
01:43:45,383 --> 01:43:52,383
And...that might be a part of why he is the way he is. 

1510
01:43:52,383 --> 01:43:53,724
I don't miss her any more, 

1511
01:43:53,724 --> 01:43:57,916
it's been a long time. 1973. That's a long enough time. 

1512
01:43:57,916 --> 01:44:02,988
I can't even...some of the time, you can't even picture her face. 

1513
01:44:02,988 --> 01:44:06,466
She was all right. But, you know, 

1514
01:44:06,466 --> 01:44:10,910
she died young and left a beautiful corpse. When they do that, 

1515
01:44:10,910 --> 01:44:15,060
it's easier to think they were the one. She probably wasn't. 

1516
01:44:15,060 --> 01:44:19,544
She was a...she was a mouthy little bitch as well. 

1517
01:44:19,544 --> 01:44:22,269
But she was great at the same time. 

1518
01:44:22,269 --> 01:44:25,287
For a woman to be really interesting, 

1519
01:44:25,287 --> 01:44:28,179
she's got to be something of a bitch, surely? 

1520
01:44:28,179 --> 01:44:32,120
Somebody saying yes all the time, that's no fucking good, is it? 

1521
01:44:32,120 --> 01:44:35,682
You want somebody who gives you a run for your money. 

1522
01:44:35,682 --> 01:44:40,209
No relationship can survive a guy or a girl being in a rock band. 

1523
01:44:40,209 --> 01:44:42,766
Unless the other one is also in a rock band, 

1524
01:44:42,766 --> 01:44:44,610
and even then it's difficult. 

1525
01:44:44,610 --> 01:44:47,754
You're away for six or seven months of the year. 

1526
01:44:47,754 --> 01:44:49,263
Nobody will stand for that. 

1527
01:44:49,263 --> 01:44:52,784
Either they go with you, which doesn't work, or they sit at home 

1528
01:44:52,784 --> 01:44:56,556
and have affairs or take care of the kids, which builds up resentment, 

1529
01:44:56,556 --> 01:45:00,371
because they think you're having a whale of a time on the road. 

1530
01:45:00,371 --> 01:45:04,018
It can't work. You have to make up your mind between rock and roll 

1531
01:45:04,018 --> 01:45:08,502
or your beloved one. Sex only lasts for half an hour at the very top. 

1532
01:45:08,502 --> 01:45:12,316
A rock and roll set lasts for an hour and a half, 

1533
01:45:12,316 --> 01:45:15,376
so I think we've got that one sorted out. 

1534
01:45:17,807 --> 01:45:20,993
Do you ever stop filming? 

1535
01:45:20,993 --> 01:45:22,083
Huh? 

1536
01:45:30,424 --> 01:45:33,567
It's a pity you haven't got Smell-O-Vision. 

1537
01:45:42,244 --> 01:45:44,926
# Here's a little song I wrote 

1538
01:45:44,926 --> 01:45:47,903
# Might want to sing it note for note 

1539
01:45:47,903 --> 01:45:49,202
# Don't worry 

1540
01:45:50,754 --> 01:45:53,729
# Be happy # Don't worry, be happy now 

1541
01:45:53,729 --> 01:45:58,297
# Whoo-oo-oo 

1542
01:45:58,297 --> 01:45:59,808
# Don't worry 

1543
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:01,651
# Whoo-oo-oo 

1544
01:46:01,651 --> 01:46:02,950
# Be happy 

1545
01:46:02,950 --> 01:46:04,963
# Whoo-oo-oo 

1546
01:46:04,963 --> 01:46:07,185
# Don't worry, be happy. # 

1547
01:46:14,310 --> 01:46:19,213
# Well, if I'm in heaven or if I'm in hell 

1548
01:46:19,213 --> 01:46:25,627
# Don't matter to me because I'm under your spell 

1549
01:46:25,627 --> 01:46:29,567
# I'm playing the ace Trying to make you see 

1550
01:46:31,034 --> 01:46:32,962
# Don't matter to me 

1551
01:46:36,190 --> 01:46:39,669
# I'm over my head 

1552
01:46:39,669 --> 01:46:44,573
# And I'm driving for sure Don't matter to me 

1553
01:46:44,573 --> 01:46:46,668
# Like I told you before 

1554
01:46:46,668 --> 01:46:50,021
# I'll sink like a stone 

1555
01:46:50,021 --> 01:46:54,800
# If you leave me be Don't matter to me 

1556
01:47:00,626 --> 01:47:02,807
# Babe, you know I love you 

1557
01:47:02,807 --> 01:47:06,286
# But you can break my heart 

1558
01:47:06,286 --> 01:47:11,776
# I want to be here with you But you're tearing me apart 

1559
01:47:11,776 --> 01:47:15,296
# I wanted to be your only one 

1560
01:47:15,296 --> 01:47:17,686
# I want you to be mine 

1561
01:47:17,686 --> 01:47:21,458
# But if you're going to be this way 

1562
01:47:21,458 --> 01:47:24,518
# I just don't have the time So now if I stay 

1563
01:47:25,861 --> 01:47:28,207
# Or if I should go 

1564
01:47:28,207 --> 01:47:32,148
# Don't matter to me if I can't see you no more 

1565
01:47:33,698 --> 01:47:37,010
# If you shoot up my lights 

1566
01:47:37,010 --> 01:47:40,237
# Black night's where I'll be 

1567
01:47:40,237 --> 01:47:42,374
# It don't matter to me... # 

1568
01:48:09,579 --> 01:48:11,129
I just can imagine the party, 

1569
01:48:11,129 --> 01:48:15,656
the party for everybody to celebrate his life some day is going to be... 

1570
01:48:15,656 --> 01:48:18,632
like a head of state. 

1571
01:48:18,632 --> 01:48:23,075
I think he'll be sorely missed throughout the world when he goes. 

1572
01:48:23,075 --> 01:48:27,225
But then, I think the way it'll be and the way he would want it, 

1573
01:48:27,225 --> 01:48:29,614
there's not going to be many tears shed, 

1574
01:48:29,614 --> 01:48:32,464
but mainly what fucking great times we had. 

1575
01:48:32,464 --> 01:48:35,775
Do you know what I mean? It's going to be one of those, 

1576
01:48:35,775 --> 01:48:39,381
a sad day but also a day where everybody will get together 

1577
01:48:39,381 --> 01:48:44,327
and talk about the great fucking times they had with that man and his music. 

1578
01:48:44,327 --> 01:48:46,506
I don't know how old he is and I don't care, 

1579
01:48:46,506 --> 01:48:47,889
he could be 100 years old. 

1580
01:48:47,889 --> 01:48:50,362
The fact that he's up there still doing it 

1581
01:48:50,362 --> 01:48:52,542
is an absolute inspiration for us. 

1582
01:48:52,542 --> 01:48:57,236
We got nothing to complain about and everything to look forward to. 

1583
01:49:04,656 --> 01:49:09,057
This is what I am. This is what I do. 

1584
01:49:09,057 --> 01:49:13,206
This is what I'm supposed to do. Right here. 

1585
01:49:13,206 --> 01:49:19,493
I'm supposed to be backstage, waiting to go on. 

1586
01:49:19,493 --> 01:49:22,218
If your life was a movie, how would you want it to end? 

1587
01:49:24,271 --> 01:49:27,500
It should end with a clap of thunder 

1588
01:49:27,500 --> 01:49:31,397
and me vanishing off the top of a mountain, 

1589
01:49:31,397 --> 01:49:37,182
leaving behind a plaque which says "Fooled you, again". Yeah! 

1590
01:49:37,182 --> 01:49:41,960
Something along those lines. But of course, we can't afford the mountain 

1591
01:49:41,960 --> 01:49:44,308
and we can't afford the flash powder 

1592
01:49:44,308 --> 01:49:48,080
and we can't get the cameras up the slope, right, so there you go. 

1593
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:50,260
You can't have everything, can you? 

1594
01:49:51,893 --> 01:49:53,319
Any regrets? 

1595
01:49:53,319 --> 01:49:56,966
None. Life's too short. 

1596
01:50:01,242 --> 01:50:02,331
CROWD: Motorhead! 

1597
01:50:02,331 --> 01:50:05,601
Motorhead! Motorhead! 

1598
01:50:17,924 --> 01:50:21,193
I would like to say that you're one of the best fucking crowds 

1599
01:50:21,193 --> 01:50:23,667
we ever played for. 

1600
01:50:23,667 --> 01:50:25,218
Thank you. 

1601
01:50:27,397 --> 01:50:28,613
Don't forget us. 

1602
01:50:28,613 --> 01:50:34,145
We are Motorhead! And we play rock'n'roll! 

1603
01:50:56,613 --> 01:51:00,050
# The only way to feel the noise is when it's good and loud 

1604
01:51:00,050 --> 01:51:03,193
# So good, I can't believe it Screaming with the crowd 

1605
01:51:04,618 --> 01:51:07,972
# Don't sweat it Get it back to you 

1606
01:51:11,451 --> 01:51:15,348
# Don't sweat it Get it back to you 

1607
01:51:18,074 --> 01:51:19,833
# Overkill 

1608
01:51:19,833 --> 01:51:21,637
# Overkill 

1609
01:51:21,637 --> 01:51:23,816
# Overkill 

1610
01:51:31,863 --> 01:51:35,133
# On your feet, you feel the beat It goes straight to your spine 

1611
01:51:35,133 --> 01:51:39,534
# Shake your head, you must be dead If it don't make you fly 

1612
01:51:39,534 --> 01:51:44,145
# Don't sweat it Get it back to you 

1613
01:51:46,534 --> 01:51:50,683
# Don't sweat it Get it back to you 

1614
01:51:54,079 --> 01:51:57,641
# Overkill Overkill 

1615
01:51:57,641 --> 01:51:59,486
# Overkill 

1616
01:52:21,576 --> 01:52:24,887
# You know your body's made to move You feel it in your guts 

1617
01:52:24,887 --> 01:52:28,241
# Rock 'n' roll ain't worth the name If it don't make you strut 

1618
01:52:28,241 --> 01:52:34,024
# Don't sweat it Get it back to you 

1619
01:52:36,078 --> 01:52:40,186
# Don't sweat it Get it back to you 

1620
01:52:43,497 --> 01:52:44,798
# Overkill 

1621
01:52:46,809 --> 01:52:47,898
# Overkill. # 

1622
01:53:44,863 --> 01:53:48,551
INAUDIBLE 

1623
01:56:02,512 --> 01:56:05,447
All for one and all for another fucking year. 

1624
01:56:05,447 --> 01:56:08,676
Good one this year. Nice one. 

1625
01:56:08,676 --> 01:56:10,897
Now fuck off back to your dressing room. 

1626
01:56:12,280 --> 01:56:15,592
It was all right, this show, wasn't it? 

1627
01:56:21,501 --> 01:56:23,261
Bugger off, Greg. 

1628
01:56:23,261 --> 01:56:26,280
In the elevator? Give it a break. Oi! 

1629
01:56:26,280 --> 01:56:27,621
