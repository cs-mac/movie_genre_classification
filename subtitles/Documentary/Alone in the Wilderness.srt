1
00:00:27,238 --> 00:00:32,138
It was good to be back in the wilderness
again, where everything seems at peace.

2
00:00:33,841 --> 00:00:36,641
I was alone, just me and the animals.

3
00:00:38,156 --> 00:00:42,156
It was a great feeling, free once more
to plan and do as I pleased.

4
00:00:43,881 --> 00:00:45,681
Beyond was all around me.

5
00:00:46,377 --> 00:00:49,497
My dream was a dream no longer.

6
00:00:50,112 --> 00:00:53,212
I suppose I was here because
this was something I had to do.

7
00:00:53,231 --> 00:00:56,151
Not just dream about it, but do it.

8
00:00:56,215 --> 00:01:00,035
I suppose, too, I was here to test myself.

9
00:01:00,598 --> 00:01:02,298
Not that I had never done it before,

10
00:01:02,352 --> 00:01:06,152
but this time, it was to be a more
thorough and lasting examination.

11
00:01:08,179 --> 00:01:10,979
What was I capable of that I didn't know yet?

12
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,340
Could I truly enjoy my own company for an entire year?

13
00:01:16,373 --> 00:01:19,873
And was I equal to everything
this wild land could throw at me?

14
00:01:21,735 --> 00:01:24,935
I had seen its moods in late spring, summer and early fall

15
00:01:25,751 --> 00:01:31,051
but what about the winter?
Would I love the isolation then,

16
00:01:31,052 --> 00:01:35,752
with its bone-stabbing cold,
its ghostly silence?

17
00:01:37,325 --> 00:01:42,125
At age fifty-one, I intended to find out.

18
00:01:43,533 --> 00:01:46,933
Another hundred yards, and I broke out of the brush

19
00:01:46,976 --> 00:01:49,776
to my pile of cabin logs I had cut last July.

20
00:01:51,419 --> 00:01:53,519
I sat down and leaned against them

21
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,690
and while I chewed on a chunk of smoked salmon

22
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:59,779
my eyes wandered over the peeled logs.

23
00:02:02,898 --> 00:02:05,698
That had been a big job last summer!

24
00:02:05,765 --> 00:02:07,865
Hard work, but I enjoyed it.

25
00:02:08,978 --> 00:02:12,478
It was cool at the timber, and there were
mornings I could see my breath.

26
00:02:14,264 --> 00:02:17,064
I had harvested the logs
from a stand of spruce

27
00:02:17,065 --> 00:02:19,165
less than 300 yards from
where they were now piled.

28
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:44,816
The logs were a great deal lighter now than they were then,

29
00:02:44,827 --> 00:02:46,927
and could be handled easy enough.

30
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:55,089
It was in the late spring of 1968,

31
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:59,390
that Dick Proenneke
decided to leave civilization behind

32
00:02:59,821 --> 00:03:02,621
to live in a pristine land yet unchanged by man

33
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:07,125
and to roam a wilderness through
which few other humans have passed.

34
00:03:08,498 --> 00:03:11,498
While carving out his new life
in this remote valley

35
00:03:11,499 --> 00:03:15,099
known as Twin Lakes, Dick would
not only keep daily journals,

36
00:03:16,424 --> 00:03:21,924
but would film his Alaskan autosy with
the help of a tripod-mounted camera.

37
00:03:24,742 --> 00:03:26,842
It was time to be moving on.

38
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,050
I was anxious to get to Spike's cabin

39
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:32,451
to see if it was the way
I had left it last September.

40
00:03:38,963 --> 00:03:43,063
About 500 yards more
through the spruce and willowbrush,

41
00:03:43,064 --> 00:03:44,464
and there it was.

42
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:47,091
Its weather-grayed moose antlers

43
00:03:47,092 --> 00:03:49,692
spreading just below the peak of the roof.

44
00:03:50,128 --> 00:03:52,228
A tin can on its stove pipe,

45
00:03:52,787 --> 00:03:54,887
and its windows were boarded up.

46
00:03:59,059 --> 00:04:01,559
The cabin had everything
needed to set up housekeeping

47
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,060
until my own cabin was completed.

48
00:04:05,356 --> 00:04:09,256
A good stove, two bunks and a roof that didn't leak.

49
00:04:14,843 --> 00:04:16,243
It's May 22nd.

50
00:04:16,604 --> 00:04:19,204
Up with the sun at four o'clock
to watch the sun rise

51
00:04:19,205 --> 00:04:21,305
and the sight of the awakening land.

52
00:04:22,701 --> 00:04:27,001
It seems a shame for eyes to be shut
when such things are going on.

53
00:04:28,024 --> 00:04:32,724
Especially in this big country.
I don't want to miss anything.

54
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:47,030
Today I would hike the five miles
down to the lower lake

55
00:04:47,031 --> 00:04:49,031
to pack my third and last load of gear.

56
00:04:49,118 --> 00:04:51,818
My tools, with which to build my cabin!

57
00:04:55,339 --> 00:04:58,439
This time, with the binoculars
along, I would have an excuse

58
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,040
to stop now and then
and watch the slopes for game.

59
00:05:08,526 --> 00:05:13,926
From this high vantage point, the hill
seemed to come alive with animals.

60
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,200
I suddenly didn't feel so alone anymore.

61
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,560
Almost noon before I got back to the cabin.

62
00:05:35,123 --> 00:05:37,923
The rest of the day, I devoted to my tools.

63
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,220
I carved a mallet-head out of a spruce chunk,

64
00:05:43,546 --> 00:05:47,266
augered a hole in it and fitted a handle to it.

65
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:49,619
This would be a useful pounding tool.

66
00:05:49,693 --> 00:05:52,293
And I hadn't had to pack it in either.

67
00:05:56,914 --> 00:05:59,514
The same with the handles I made for the wood augers,

68
00:05:59,548 --> 00:06:01,948
the wide-bladed chizel and the files.

69
00:06:03,558 --> 00:06:07,058
Much easier to pack without the handles already fitted to them.

70
00:06:14,442 --> 00:06:17,942
Hope Creek had cut a big opening into the lake ice.

71
00:06:18,376 --> 00:06:20,476
Was it too early to catch a fish?

72
00:06:21,288 --> 00:06:24,088
I took the casting rod along to find out.

73
00:06:28,576 --> 00:06:30,276
It didn't take long,

74
00:06:30,277 --> 00:06:33,477
after several casts it happened
with the suddenness of a broken shoelace.

75
00:06:35,536 --> 00:06:38,336
I slid the 19-inch trout onto the stones.

76
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:41,211
Fish with my beans tonight!

77
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:52,410
It's May 25. Break-up is not
the spectacular sight it was last year.

78
00:06:53,665 --> 00:06:57,165
A big wind would have cleared the thin ice out yesterday.

79
00:06:58,028 --> 00:07:01,528
As I loaded tools onto the packboard this morning,

80
00:07:01,575 --> 00:07:03,875
the rotted ice began to flow past its exit.

81
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,670
When you have miles and
miles of lake-front

82
00:07:40,671 --> 00:07:42,571
and pictured views to consider,

83
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,929
it's difficult to select a building site.

84
00:07:46,326 --> 00:07:49,126
The more a man looks, the fuzzier he gets.

85
00:07:50,489 --> 00:07:53,289
I cleared the brush, and poured out beach gravel,

86
00:07:53,241 --> 00:07:58,161
and spread it to a depth of several
inches over an area roughly 20x20 feet.

87
00:07:59,335 --> 00:08:02,135
I felt I had made the best possible choice.

88
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:08,849
It would be 11x15 feet.
Its front-door would face northwest.

89
00:08:09,782 --> 00:08:12,582
And the big window would look down to the lake.

90
00:08:14,558 --> 00:08:18,558
A pile of logs. Which ones to start with?

91
00:08:19,391 --> 00:08:22,191
To make a notch fit properly you can't rush it.

92
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,880
Make several saw cuts
an inch or two apart

93
00:08:24,881 --> 00:08:26,881
almost down to the pencil line,

94
00:08:27,531 --> 00:08:32,331
and whack out the chunks with an axe,
until the notch is roughly formed.

95
00:08:32,716 --> 00:08:37,016
Then comes the finish work.
A careful custom fit.

96
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:40,017
I have just the tool for the job.

97
00:09:45,449 --> 00:09:48,949
One log in particular required considerable
hewing to straighten it.

98
00:09:49,435 --> 00:09:54,935
I must say white spruce works up nicely
with an ax and a draw-knife.

99
00:10:01,007 --> 00:10:03,807
Enough for this evening. The job had begun.

100
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,980
Tomorrow should see more working and less figuring.

101
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:17,230
It's May 29. Only a few chunks of ice
floating in the lake this morning.

102
00:10:19,403 --> 00:10:22,203
By noon there was no ice to be seen.

103
00:10:22,796 --> 00:10:25,496
It was good to see
the lake in motion again

104
00:10:25,497 --> 00:10:27,697
and it was even better
to slip the canoe into the water...

105
00:10:28,456 --> 00:10:31,256
...and paddle to work for a change!

106
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,820
I glided silently along over a different pathway.

107
00:10:55,444 --> 00:11:00,944
The cabin is growing. 28 logs are in place.
44 should do it,

108
00:11:01,581 --> 00:11:04,381
except for the gable ends and roof logs.

109
00:11:05,286 --> 00:11:09,186
It really looks a mess to see
the butts extending beyond the corners,

110
00:11:09,187 --> 00:11:12,187
but I will trim them off later.

111
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:16,799
You can't rush it.
I don't want these logs looking as if

112
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,800
a boy scout was turned loose on them
with a dull hatchet.

113
00:11:36,685 --> 00:11:40,185
I was making good progress today
when I heard a plane.

114
00:11:40,186 --> 00:11:42,486
It was Babe Alsworth.

115
00:11:42,943 --> 00:11:47,043
I watched the plane glide in
for a perfect landing on the calm lake.

116
00:11:53,186 --> 00:11:56,686
Plenty of groceries this time,
and among the supplies, rhubarb plants!

117
00:11:58,748 --> 00:12:01,548
They should be put in the ground right away.

118
00:12:02,999 --> 00:12:05,799
I found the frost about four or five inches down.

119
00:12:11,353 --> 00:12:14,853
I planted fifteen hills of potatoes,
tucked in some onion sets,

120
00:12:16,221 --> 00:12:21,221
and put in a few rows of peas,
carrots, beets and rutabagas.

121
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:24,057
Not much of a garden
by Iowa standards,

122
00:12:24,058 --> 00:12:27,858
but it would tell me
what I wanted to find out.

123
00:12:30,034 --> 00:12:32,334
Finally back to the cabin building.

124
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:36,035
I am a better builder
than I am a farmer, anyway.

125
00:12:36,397 --> 00:12:39,897
38 logs are in place and
I'm almost ready for the eave logs.

126
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:43,461
I cut the opening
for the big window,

127
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:46,462
for the two smaller ones
and the opening for the door.

128
00:12:54,709 --> 00:12:59,209
Five logs were very special. These were the 20-footers,

129
00:12:59,307 --> 00:13:02,807
which along with the gable ends
would make the backbone of my roof.

130
00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:07,009
Two would be eave logs,
two would be purlin logs

131
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:10,610
and the last and straightest one
would be the ridge log.

132
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:17,790
As it stands now, the cabin looks like
as logs are sticking out all over it.

133
00:13:18,091 --> 00:13:20,591
Like the quills of a porcupine.

134
00:13:32,057 --> 00:13:34,057
I have made good progress today.

135
00:13:34,058 --> 00:13:39,958
My cabin logs have changed form in
the ten days since I cut the first notch.

136
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:49,670
It's June 7, and I believe the growing season is at hand.

137
00:13:50,114 --> 00:13:53,014
The buckbrush and willows
are leafing out fast now,

138
00:13:53,015 --> 00:13:55,015
the rhubarb is growing,

139
00:13:55,439 --> 00:13:58,939
and I noticed my onion sets
are spiking up through the earth.

140
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,060
Those windowframes
have been on my mind.

141
00:14:03,061 --> 00:14:05,361
Decided to do something about it.

142
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:08,781
First I build a sawhorse workbench.

143
00:14:08,844 --> 00:14:13,344
Then selected straight grain sections
of logs cut from the windows.

144
00:14:13,732 --> 00:14:17,832
With a thin blade of wide chizel,
I cut deep along the line on each side.

145
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:24,060
Worked fine. I smoothed the split side with a draw knife.

146
00:14:24,726 --> 00:14:28,226
The result was a real nice board,
so I continued to fashion others.

147
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,219
Put 'em in place and nail 'em in.

148
00:14:43,658 --> 00:14:47,058
I finished today cleaning
the litter of woodchips.

149
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:50,859
I mounted them in front
of the door, beaver-lodge style.

150
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,980
Quite a pile for eleven day's work.
Enough to impress that beaver.

151
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:13,825
It's June 9. Today would be a day
away from the job of building.

152
00:15:14,058 --> 00:15:17,558
I'd look for the pole timber for the roof up lake.

153
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:50,739
After beaching the canoe, I walked through the timber,

154
00:15:51,164 --> 00:15:55,364
crossing and recrossing the creek that
had its beginnings in the far off snows.

155
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:04,829
Good pines were not as plentiful as I had figured,

156
00:16:05,238 --> 00:16:08,738
and I worked steadily to get 48 out
and packed at the beach by noon.

157
00:16:10,172 --> 00:16:12,272
The mosquitoes were out in force.

158
00:16:13,045 --> 00:16:18,045
To peel the poles, I made a tripod of
short sticks on which to rest one end,

159
00:16:18,046 --> 00:16:20,046
and put the draw-knife to work.

160
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:25,355
I rafted them up, and moved them down the lake to my beach.

161
00:16:26,547 --> 00:16:29,347
A good pile, but I doubted there would be enough.

162
00:16:35,117 --> 00:16:38,617
Today I would secure the roof poles over the gables.

163
00:16:40,107 --> 00:16:41,927
A cabin roof takes time.

164
00:16:49,295 --> 00:16:53,495
Soon I would be ready to saw the ends
and fill the slots between the pole butts

165
00:16:53,496 --> 00:16:55,496
onto the eaves.

166
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:06,170
It's June 18. Everything looks
as though it had a bath last night.

167
00:17:06,553 --> 00:17:10,053
Must have been a good shower,
and I never even heard it.

168
00:17:11,292 --> 00:17:15,492
A check on the livestock this morning
before going down to the roof job--

169
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:21,059
--a few caribou cows and their calves
just up country from Low Pass Creek.

170
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,760
Nothing else in sight.

171
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:27,626
Should be a bear passing through
one of these days!

172
00:17:46,402 --> 00:17:49,402
These fillers should be called
squirrel frustrators.

173
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:54,803
Give those characters an entrance
and they can ruin a cabin.

174
00:17:54,868 --> 00:17:57,068
I finished filling the slots
between the roof poles

175
00:17:57,069 --> 00:17:59,069
and cocked joints with oakum.

176
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:03,070
I kinked around the blocks
on the outside.

177
00:18:03,131 --> 00:18:06,631
Any place I could get a table knife blade in, got oakum.

178
00:18:12,418 --> 00:18:15,018
Next was a job I had been
thinking about.

179
00:18:15,019 --> 00:18:18,419
A countertop,
some window ledges and some shelves.

180
00:18:20,296 --> 00:18:23,796
I decided ripping them with the ripsaw was the answer.

181
00:18:24,335 --> 00:18:27,235
I could go down the middle of a log
5" in diameter

182
00:18:27,236 --> 00:18:33,236
and 42" long in fifteen minutes.
Couldn't complain about that.

183
00:18:35,983 --> 00:18:39,083
I think I have sawed
nearly everything I need.

184
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:41,884
Now, to trim the edges and start building.

185
00:19:11,137 --> 00:19:13,537
I need a fish for supper.

186
00:19:13,538 --> 00:19:16,238
So I took the fly rod
down to Hope Creek.

187
00:19:17,001 --> 00:19:19,001
The grayling were feeding greedily.

188
00:19:19,002 --> 00:19:22,202
Fins and tails swirling
all over the surface.

189
00:19:23,417 --> 00:19:28,917
A fish snapped the fly on the
very first cast. A handsome grayling.

190
00:19:29,773 --> 00:19:34,573
17¼ inches long. Enough for my needs.

191
00:19:35,571 --> 00:19:37,071
It's July 2.

192
00:19:37,072 --> 00:19:41,772
After a peaceful trip down lake
I located ten spruce tops.

193
00:19:42,112 --> 00:19:44,912
I was anxious to try making hinges for the door.

194
00:20:00,812 --> 00:20:03,812
I worked the wood to shape with an axe and a draw knife.

195
00:20:04,243 --> 00:20:06,343
Now to saw the fork and butt end.

196
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,960
45 minutes and I had my hinge made. Not bad.

197
00:20:34,505 --> 00:20:38,005
I put some finishing touch
on the door planks I made Sunday.

198
00:20:38,953 --> 00:20:41,753
Now the door is ready to put together.

199
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:48,708
Too many men work on parts of things.
Doing a job to completion, satisfies me.

200
00:20:55,992 --> 00:20:59,092
My roof poles are still
too wet for the tarpaper,

201
00:20:59,093 --> 00:21:02,193
so I will work on my double-deck bunk.

202
00:21:02,701 --> 00:21:05,501
Four posts with two rails on each side-

203
00:21:05,547 --> 00:21:08,347
-and two small and two large on each end.

204
00:21:09,131 --> 00:21:13,931
I augered 1½" holes
and trim the rail poles to fit.

205
00:21:27,187 --> 00:21:28,687
Now when I get some glue,

206
00:21:28,688 --> 00:21:31,688
I'll knock it apart
and glue it back together.

207
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:37,525
With a few leftover poles,
I built myself a chair and a bench.

208
00:21:40,616 --> 00:21:46,816
It's June 27. A good rain it was last night.
Today would be a pole-hunting day.

209
00:21:47,667 --> 00:21:51,167
I need about thirty to make the slats for my bunks.

210
00:21:51,411 --> 00:21:55,011
After peeling the poles
the wind came up strong.

211
00:21:55,012 --> 00:21:58,212
It brought rain and furrowed
the lake rough as a cob.

212
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:03,179
This lake can really change its
personality in a hurry. Like a woman!

213
00:22:04,373 --> 00:22:08,373
All smiles one minute,
and dancing in temper-tantrum the next.

214
00:22:11,401 --> 00:22:14,201
Tomorrow is Sunday. I will go someplace.

215
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:20,029
Next morning I loaded up
my camera gear,

216
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:22,330
and started walking
up the trail to the hump.

217
00:22:23,522 --> 00:22:26,322
It was good to take a break away from the cabin.

218
00:22:29,669 --> 00:22:32,469
As I topped the ridge along a dry wash,

219
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:35,870
a wolf came up from the other side,
30 or 40 paces away.

220
00:22:36,594 --> 00:22:38,694
Then in a wink, she was gone.

221
00:22:39,701 --> 00:22:41,801
The wolves had made a kill.

222
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:46,350
All that was left of the young caribou
was the backbone and rib cage.

223
00:22:47,975 --> 00:22:52,075
The skin was badly torn
and pulled down over the front legs.

224
00:22:52,076 --> 00:22:54,476
As you would peel back a rubber glove.

225
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:02,800
It looks like the wolves aren't
the only problem the caribous have.

226
00:23:03,651 --> 00:23:07,851
What was a bull caribou doing down there,
where not a breath of air was stirring?

227
00:23:08,988 --> 00:23:12,488
Insects were whirling around me
like sawdust blown from a power saw.

228
00:23:14,256 --> 00:23:17,056
The bull also was having
a battle with the tinies.

229
00:23:18,709 --> 00:23:23,509
Stomping, shaking, twisting,
turning and shivering his hide.

230
00:23:40,389 --> 00:23:45,889
He would lie down and get back up again.
No rest at all.

231
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:49,270
Why doesn't he climb to
a breeze or take a swim?

232
00:23:49,271 --> 00:23:55,071
Anything but stand and fight something
he can't hope to kill or scare away.

233
00:23:58,514 --> 00:24:01,314
With a yell and a waving of arms, I spooked him.

234
00:24:02,406 --> 00:24:04,506
He threw his antlers back
and off he clattered

235
00:24:04,507 --> 00:24:06,907
over the stones and up the creek.

236
00:24:07,452 --> 00:24:09,552
Good luck to you, old boy!

237
00:24:32,657 --> 00:24:37,157
It's July 3. A cool, damp morning with fog
coming off the slopes

238
00:24:37,895 --> 00:24:40,695
like the smoke from many campfires.

239
00:24:41,341 --> 00:24:44,841
No wind now, so it's a perfect day for the tarpaper job.

240
00:24:46,416 --> 00:24:50,216
I left the felt paper four to five inches.

241
00:24:50,394 --> 00:24:53,194
I need just one more strip, twenty feet long.

242
00:24:53,775 --> 00:24:58,275
I must admit the cabin looks
better already with the start of a roof.

243
00:25:02,093 --> 00:25:05,093
Next I unrolled the polyethylene
and tucked the edges together

244
00:25:05,094 --> 00:25:06,994
to get at least four thicknesses
to tack through.

245
00:25:08,296 --> 00:25:10,396
And I fastnened her down.

246
00:25:15,807 --> 00:25:18,607
Next I built a carrying rack for the moss.

247
00:25:18,902 --> 00:25:21,102
I filed a blade from
my round-point shovel,

248
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:23,803
then I was ready for
the moss-cutting detail.

249
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:32,090
I cut out rectangles about 18"x36" and 8" thick.

250
00:25:32,905 --> 00:25:36,405
Two chunks double-decked on the rack made a good load.

251
00:25:41,408 --> 00:25:45,908
I put it around the edges of the roof,
and the cabin took on a new look.

252
00:25:48,605 --> 00:25:52,005
I feel guilty about the
tarpaper and the polyethylene,

253
00:25:52,006 --> 00:25:54,506
because they are not
true wilderness cabin materials!

254
00:25:55,638 --> 00:26:02,138
But I am convinced they will do
a better job at keeping the weather out.

255
00:26:06,055 --> 00:26:11,255
It seems I have cleared two acres of
moss, and the roof still isn't covered.

256
00:26:12,954 --> 00:26:19,154
A beautiful still evening. The cabin is
starting to look as though it belongs.

257
00:26:20,939 --> 00:26:24,439
This morning I cut, hauled and peeled eleven logs by noon.

258
00:26:25,781 --> 00:26:29,281
I would spend today on the construction of the john.

259
00:26:29,751 --> 00:26:32,551
An important consideration in any new home!

260
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,500
Materials to finish the front
required lots of time,

261
00:26:37,501 --> 00:26:41,001
ripping boards from
the last of my cabin logs.

262
00:26:46,098 --> 00:26:49,598
It was twelve o'clock when I finished the last cut.

263
00:26:49,987 --> 00:26:55,487
Four boards would make the door,
and the fifth would hold it together.

264
00:27:01,334 --> 00:27:06,834
I made the hinges from a gas-can,
and they looked almost store-bought.

265
00:27:07,624 --> 00:27:12,124
And then the final touch. Saw out
a crescent. And the john was done.

266
00:27:14,806 --> 00:27:17,906
July 23. A day to hang the door.

267
00:27:19,236 --> 00:27:22,736
I put the door into the opening and
fastened the top and bottom hinges.

268
00:27:24,023 --> 00:27:27,523
I checked and re-checked my hinges
to see that they were in line.

269
00:27:28,654 --> 00:27:31,054
I pulled the hinge pins,
set the door on an edge

270
00:27:31,055 --> 00:27:33,555
and sawed it nearly through
for a dutch door,

271
00:27:34,267 --> 00:27:36,367
which I intended it to be.

272
00:27:37,232 --> 00:27:42,052
I put on some glue and nailed it fast.

273
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:49,700
Door works quiet and easy,
with all four hinges secured.

274
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:52,601
Not perfect,
but plenty close for rural work.

275
00:27:55,263 --> 00:28:00,763
I must devise a latch for it.
Not just hooks like a barn door.

276
00:28:15,512 --> 00:28:21,712
All I needed was a lock. I'd like to see
a bear try and figure this thing out.

277
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,220
But I suppose he would just
solve the problem

278
00:28:24,221 --> 00:28:27,021
by wiping the door clean
from the wooden hinges.

279
00:28:30,382 --> 00:28:34,882
After finishing the latch, I went
blueberring up on the Cowgill Bench.

280
00:28:35,309 --> 00:28:37,129
I found a good patch.

281
00:28:38,068 --> 00:28:43,568
I fear the blueberries really took a nipping
from the heavy frost not so long ago.

282
00:28:44,186 --> 00:28:49,686
I found some berries big and healthy.
But many are small and shriveled.

283
00:28:51,518 --> 00:28:55,018
When my can was nearly full
I noticed a movement across the creek.

284
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,260
Something yellow and brown.

285
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:02,030
A big bear, not fifty yards away!

286
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:04,831
I think I have picked
the wrong blueberry patch.

287
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:15,150
Lucky for me, and him, he didn't like my smell.

288
00:29:24,331 --> 00:29:28,431
July 31. A tin-bending day.

289
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:31,559
Made a water bucket.
A wash pan. A dish pan.

290
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,260
A flower pan, and storage cans.

291
00:29:34,686 --> 00:29:36,786
My cabin kitchen is shaping up.

292
00:29:42,561 --> 00:29:46,061
I needed a big wooden spoon
to dip hotcake batter onto the griddle.

293
00:29:47,315 --> 00:29:49,415
One spoonful = one hotcake.

294
00:29:51,965 --> 00:29:55,465
In the woodpile I found scraps
of stump wood that looked suitable.

295
00:29:56,599 --> 00:30:00,099
It took me no more than an hour
to turn out a good looking spoon.

296
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:04,610
I must make a wooden bowl too later on.

297
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:21,159
Today is the big day.

298
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:24,060
I will load all of my remaining gear
into the canoe,

299
00:30:24,061 --> 00:30:27,461
and paddle down to my new home.

300
00:30:31,521 --> 00:30:37,321
The lake is dead calm. A perfect day for moving.

301
00:30:47,347 --> 00:30:49,447
Everything found its place,

302
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:51,548
and there was lots of room
for everything.

303
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:54,249
Not a cluttered look at all.

304
00:30:56,943 --> 00:30:59,743
Five inches of foam rubber
on my new bunk

305
00:30:59,744 --> 00:31:01,444
will make it just about right.

306
00:31:02,034 --> 00:31:05,134
I can hear Hope Creek real plain.

307
00:31:05,135 --> 00:31:08,135
That will be
a pleasant sound to go to sleep by.

308
00:31:09,429 --> 00:31:12,929
And the view from my window isn't too bad, either.

309
00:31:15,718 --> 00:31:17,518
Best sleep in a long time.

310
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,919
The sound of the waves
lapping the gravel beach--

311
00:31:20,281 --> 00:31:25,781
--and the never ending rustle of
Hope Creek. No better sleeping pill!

312
00:31:26,844 --> 00:31:28,944
The woodpile needs attention.

313
00:31:29,261 --> 00:31:33,081
I must drop a few spruce nags
and buck them into the sections.

314
00:31:33,819 --> 00:31:36,619
Dry standing timber makes the best firewood.

315
00:31:46,929 --> 00:31:49,029
There is a rhythm to the saw

316
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:51,930
as its teeth eat back and forth
into the deepening cut.

317
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:55,335
But I must admit, I enjoy the splitting more.

318
00:32:00,672 --> 00:32:04,672
I heard a plane. It was Babe at last with supplies.

319
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:08,910
He had brought in some fresh groceries
that needed refrigeration.

320
00:32:10,363 --> 00:32:14,063
I had dug down a foot
into the moss just yesterday,

321
00:32:14,064 --> 00:32:17,864
and found frost, and lined the hole
with a gas-can box.

322
00:32:18,556 --> 00:32:23,056
The thermometer in the cooler box
under the moss reads 40º,

323
00:32:23,057 --> 00:32:26,457
and here it is close to 80º  today.

324
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:32,040
While cultivating the garden,

325
00:32:32,041 --> 00:32:34,541
I rolled out a few potatoes
that looked like walnuts.

326
00:32:36,143 --> 00:32:39,643
Not record breakers for size,
but they had real smooth skins!

327
00:32:40,878 --> 00:32:45,098
The crops to grow at Twin Lakes
are potatoes, rhubarb, lettuce,

328
00:32:45,099 --> 00:32:49,999
onions and radishes. My green onions
looked pretty respectable.

329
00:32:51,375 --> 00:32:53,475
I am getting hungry for a fish.

330
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:59,359
After many casts at the mouth
of Hope Creek, I was onto one.

331
00:32:59,833 --> 00:33:02,033
I worked him in easy,

332
00:33:02,034 --> 00:33:06,034
for I was fish hungry
and didn't want to lose this lake trout.

333
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:18,000
I could see him browning in the pan
as I dressed him out,

334
00:33:18,001 --> 00:33:20,601
and I left his entrails for the birds.

335
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:27,500
Fried potatoes, onions and fish. You can't beat that!

336
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:35,260
Time to take a break away from the cabin.
I would go up high today.

337
00:33:38,106 --> 00:33:41,606
There were many sheep and ram
scattered here and there.

338
00:33:42,894 --> 00:33:46,694
I spotted six big rams on Black Mountain.

339
00:33:46,887 --> 00:33:48,987
Two had better than a full curl.

340
00:33:53,218 --> 00:33:56,118
A man could lose himself up here.

341
00:33:56,119 --> 00:34:01,119
One bad step and I would
keep on going right down the mountain.

342
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:04,047
But risk now and then is good for a man.

343
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:08,510
One mis-step here, and a man
would have to settle with the Lord,

344
00:34:08,511 --> 00:34:12,111
right here on the mountain.

345
00:34:51,351 --> 00:34:55,351
Close at hand, the mosses and grasses
were full of tiny flowers.

346
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,100
It is another world of beauty.

347
00:34:59,219 --> 00:35:02,519
The more I see as I sit
here among the rocks,

348
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:06,120
the more I wonder about
what I am not seeing.

349
00:35:14,458 --> 00:35:17,058
A flickering movement to my left.

350
00:35:17,059 --> 00:35:21,659
The stone seemed to move, and turned
into a mother ptarmigan and a brood.

351
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:25,959
The young was just as camouflaged as the mother.

352
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,620
They were feeding.

353
00:35:28,621 --> 00:35:31,821
Huddled like chickens
as they walked along the slope.

354
00:35:38,237 --> 00:35:41,737
Not too far away I spotted a mother brown bear with two cubs.

355
00:35:43,255 --> 00:35:47,455
It was probably the same family I had
seen at different times during the spring.

356
00:35:48,591 --> 00:35:53,691
She was rounded out like a cask. Must be
lots of vitamins along those slopes.

357
00:36:03,233 --> 00:36:07,733
It was getting late and a little chilly,
and it was time to leave.

358
00:36:08,152 --> 00:36:11,652
I had taken a long look into the heart of the high places.

359
00:36:16,548 --> 00:36:22,048
It's September 6. This would be
the morning to start the fireplace.

360
00:36:22,272 --> 00:36:27,272
I had been packing flat stones from the
bed of Hope Creek for the past few days.

361
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,052
The sound of geese heading north

362
00:36:30,053 --> 00:36:34,553
made me even more anxious
to get the project underway.

363
00:36:35,265 --> 00:36:41,465
The lake was moon-still. A good morning
to haul some sand. Four loads of sand.

364
00:36:46,617 --> 00:36:50,017
I won't cut the hole on
the back of the cabin too high

365
00:36:50,018 --> 00:36:53,518
until I find out how this
rock laying is gonna go.

366
00:36:58,663 --> 00:37:04,863
Today is spent on the outside. The
chimney is a good 12" high and 9" thick.

367
00:37:07,293 --> 00:37:13,493
I hated cutting into those logs I had fit
with such care, but it had to be done.

368
00:37:21,889 --> 00:37:26,089
It's September 8. I roughed out
my arch today with my axe,

369
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:28,390
and then finished it off with the jack-plane.

370
00:37:30,217 --> 00:37:33,017
I set it in place and spiked it to the post.

371
00:37:35,468 --> 00:37:38,068
All my stones in front of the the fireplace

372
00:37:38,069 --> 00:37:40,969
have been collected in my travels
up and down both lakes,

373
00:37:41,862 --> 00:37:44,162
the high country and the low.

374
00:37:44,163 --> 00:37:48,063
So they are representative
of the entire area.

375
00:37:52,809 --> 00:37:58,009
Today, while it was still frosty, I cut
a notch in the rear overhang of the roof

376
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:59,710
to let the chimney through.

377
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:04,020
My collapsable form
couldn't have worked better.

378
00:38:04,021 --> 00:38:06,421
I'm glad I took the time to make it.

379
00:38:07,127 --> 00:38:10,027
By tomorrow evening
I had better be done,

380
00:38:10,028 --> 00:38:12,328
since the last cement sack will be empty.

381
00:38:14,156 --> 00:38:18,056
After two weeks, with
fingertips worn thin and tender,

382
00:38:18,057 --> 00:38:20,357
I am ready for the cold weather.

383
00:38:28,507 --> 00:38:32,307
This new day is clear, calm and 28 degrees.

384
00:38:33,093 --> 00:38:37,593
There is white frost on the brush,
and on the gravel of the beach.

385
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:40,024
The lake is like a huge puddle,

386
00:38:40,025 --> 00:38:45,325
grinning with the reflections of the
fall colors well along on the mountains.

387
00:38:45,877 --> 00:38:48,077
Today was meant for canoe travel.

388
00:38:48,078 --> 00:38:51,078
I would go to the lower end
of the lower lake

389
00:38:51,491 --> 00:38:54,691
where the Chilikadrotna River
begins its long swift journey

390
00:38:54,692 --> 00:38:57,492
to merge with the Molchotna
and Chuchigak.

391
00:38:59,115 --> 00:39:03,215
It would be a paddle of 8.5 miles, one way.

392
00:39:14,705 --> 00:39:17,505
It was a joy to travel the flat lake.

393
00:39:17,956 --> 00:39:21,556
I dug the paddle deep
and the canoe slid along easily,

394
00:39:21,557 --> 00:39:23,457
throwing ripples to either side.

395
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:28,530
Near the lower end of the lake,
I spotted a fine caribou bull.

396
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:33,520
He was acting strangely.
When I saw him wade into the lake,

397
00:39:33,521 --> 00:39:37,321
it dawned on me. He wanted
to cross to the other side!

398
00:39:38,133 --> 00:39:42,633
The race was on. He would show me
how fast a bull caribou could swim!

399
00:39:43,747 --> 00:39:47,047
I didn't wanna get too close
in case he'd turn on me.

400
00:39:47,048 --> 00:39:50,648
He could overturn my canoe
with no trouble.

401
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:54,470
Maybe he figured he couldn't
get rid of me on land,

402
00:39:54,471 --> 00:39:57,571
so he did what he would have done
with a wolf in pursuit.

403
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,720
Take to the lake, swim, and lose the enemy!

404
00:40:12,776 --> 00:40:15,576
The caribou is an animal of the open country.

405
00:40:16,048 --> 00:40:18,448
It seems like he likes
to get up on the high ridges,

406
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:21,949
where the breeze blows
to keep the insects away.

407
00:40:34,903 --> 00:40:39,103
The bull moose, which I haven't seen
much of all summer long,

408
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:42,604
doesn't seem to fear me,
or much of anything, now.

409
00:40:43,562 --> 00:40:48,062
After several hours of thrashing
and destroying a patch of willow bushes,

410
00:40:49,347 --> 00:40:52,847
the bull was free from the blood covered, velvet-like material.

411
00:40:56,227 --> 00:40:58,527
It seems this time of year,

412
00:40:58,528 --> 00:41:04,128
the bulls lose all good sense
and come right out in the open.

413
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:08,010
Afraid of nobody, and that's when hunting season opens.

414
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,720
And that's the end of the hill.

415
00:41:15,886 --> 00:41:20,086
I woke up this morning surprised to see
four inches of snow on the ground.

416
00:41:21,005 --> 00:41:23,805
Looks like I finished my fireplace just in time.

417
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:31,442
It's a frosty morning at 23º.
35º in my cooler box.

418
00:41:31,771 --> 00:41:33,871
And the lake water at 42º.

419
00:41:34,432 --> 00:41:37,232
But the pressure is off.
The fireplace is built,

420
00:41:38,305 --> 00:41:42,805
and what little there is yet to do
can be done regardless of the weather.

421
00:42:13,528 --> 00:42:15,528
It's the end of September now,

422
00:42:15,529 --> 00:42:19,429
and if I was gonna stay the winter
I would need more meat.

423
00:42:20,982 --> 00:42:23,782
Today was the last day of sheep season.

424
00:42:23,919 --> 00:42:27,419
And the sight of four good rams in a bunch
convinced me.

425
00:42:30,415 --> 00:42:33,015
Although this handsome bull
makes it tempting,

426
00:42:33,016 --> 00:42:36,316
lucky for him I like sheep meat
better than caribou.

427
00:42:45,894 --> 00:42:51,094
I open and close the hunting season with
one shot. The search for meat is over.

428
00:42:51,979 --> 00:42:55,079
I hated to see the big ram end like this,

429
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:58,880
but I suppose he could have died
a lot harder than he did.

430
00:43:01,109 --> 00:43:03,509
The pelt must have weighed
a hundred pounds

431
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:05,310
when I dragged it from the water.

432
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:09,220
Nearly all blood was soaked out of the beautiful white hide.

433
00:43:10,345 --> 00:43:14,845
I put my smoker into operation,
and I kept it going all day.

434
00:43:22,696 --> 00:43:28,196
Sheep liver and onions for supper.
A satisfying day.

435
00:43:31,313 --> 00:43:35,813
September 23. Clear, calm and a frosty 20 degrees.

436
00:43:36,627 --> 00:43:39,127
Hope Creek is beginning to ice up.

437
00:43:39,128 --> 00:43:43,528
I put the thermometer
into the creek mouth. 31 degrees.

438
00:43:43,881 --> 00:43:47,381
If the creek stopped moving
it would freeze up in no time.

439
00:43:56,970 --> 00:44:00,470
Today I would cut up wood
to build up my supplies.

440
00:44:00,757 --> 00:44:04,457
This business of taking wood
out of the savings bank

441
00:44:04,458 --> 00:44:07,658
and putting none back
has been bothering me to no end.

442
00:44:10,677 --> 00:44:13,577
Plenty of meat hanging
from the meat tree.

443
00:44:13,578 --> 00:44:16,878
Plenty of wood.
My cabin tight and warm.

444
00:44:17,256 --> 00:44:19,356
I looked forward to freeze-up.

445
00:44:53,034 --> 00:44:54,734
It is November now,

446
00:44:54,735 --> 00:44:58,235
and in preparing for freeze-up,
I made a sled out of spruce poles.

447
00:44:58,921 --> 00:45:01,721
Using the spruce runners,
I had put in traction.

448
00:45:02,575 --> 00:45:07,675
The frame was held together with pegs,
and short pole bracings.

449
00:45:08,128 --> 00:45:13,228
I plained the runner smooth and
painted them with a film of woodglue.

450
00:45:27,539 --> 00:45:30,339
With its deck poles, handles and crossbars,

451
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,780
it would be a vehicle in which I could push
a good-sized load.

452
00:45:35,868 --> 00:45:38,668
Too bad I didn't have a caribou to pull it.

453
00:46:32,767 --> 00:46:39,267
Dead calm and zero degrees.
The wind and snow died during the night.

454
00:46:42,556 --> 00:46:46,056
It's important that I keep my pathway to the lake open.

455
00:46:51,595 --> 00:46:55,095
I chipped through three inches of ice to fill my water bucket.

456
00:46:55,878 --> 00:47:00,378
In a short time I will have a safe
highway for miles in each direction.

457
00:47:00,747 --> 00:47:02,567
Freeze-up has arrived.

458
00:47:04,681 --> 00:47:09,181
It's warm inside my cabin. A toasty forty degrees.

459
00:47:10,188 --> 00:47:15,088
Peppery ram stew for supper.
Just the way I like it.

460
00:47:15,089 --> 00:47:18,089
It's got everything in it
but the kitchen sponge.

461
00:48:02,043 --> 00:48:05,043
Dead calm and zero degrees.

462
00:48:05,044 --> 00:48:08,244
The lake ice has increased
one inch in 24 hours.

463
00:48:09,573 --> 00:48:13,073
It took one hour to the gravel bank of
the connecting stream.

464
00:48:13,563 --> 00:48:15,663
Not quite as fast as paddling.

465
00:48:17,157 --> 00:48:22,657
I saw big wolf tracks in the drifted snow.
Then I saw many more wolf tracks.

466
00:48:23,169 --> 00:48:24,569
A bad sign.

467
00:48:32,902 --> 00:48:37,402
About a hundred yards further on,
a dead calf, on the bank.

468
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:40,740
They had not fed on the carcass at all.

469
00:48:42,641 --> 00:48:48,141
I butchered it up into sections.
There was frozen blood on his hind legs.

470
00:48:48,142 --> 00:48:50,542
Evidently one of the wolves killed him

471
00:48:50,543 --> 00:48:53,343
while the rest of the pack
held his attention.

472
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:57,006
Had they done it just for sport?

473
00:48:57,007 --> 00:49:00,507
Suddenly the wolves lost
a few points with me.

474
00:49:01,158 --> 00:49:03,958
I loaded up the sled and headed for home.

475
00:49:07,831 --> 00:49:10,531
I chopped off a chunk
of moose hindquarter.

476
00:49:10,532 --> 00:49:12,332
The meat shattered like ice.

477
00:49:13,213 --> 00:49:18,713
The magpie soon took command.
But there would be plenty for all.

478
00:49:28,371 --> 00:49:30,571
December 31.

479
00:49:30,572 --> 00:49:33,872
32 degrees below zero
during the heat of the day.

480
00:49:34,858 --> 00:49:39,058
Today I hiked a couple
miles down the lake.

481
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:42,759
I do believe winter at Twin Lakes
is better than summer.

482
00:49:43,739 --> 00:49:47,239
I crossed a wolverine track
that was headed for Low Pass Creek.

483
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:51,450
I must be on the lookout for that character.

484
00:50:00,005 --> 00:50:02,805
On such a trip, snowshoes are a must.

485
00:50:03,923 --> 00:50:09,423
With no wind I could travel all day
in -45ºF, and be comfortable.

486
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:15,425
It is warmer on top of the pass
than it is along the lake.

487
00:50:16,086 --> 00:50:18,186
Moisture must make the difference.

488
00:50:18,927 --> 00:50:22,027
My face and fingers
felt the bite and the cold

489
00:50:22,028 --> 00:50:24,128
as soon as I reached lake level.

490
00:50:27,415 --> 00:50:30,215
It was good to be back at the cabin.

491
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:51,050
January 2. 45 below zero. A land without motion.

492
00:50:51,841 --> 00:50:54,841
In the dead of winter,
nothing seems to move.

493
00:50:54,842 --> 00:50:57,042
Not even a twig on the willows.

494
00:50:58,151 --> 00:51:01,651
The thickness of the ice is now a strong 28 inches.

495
00:51:06,061 --> 00:51:11,461
In this cold weather, the hole
gradually closes in from the sides,

496
00:51:11,462 --> 00:51:13,962
until it is a hole no longer.

497
00:51:29,179 --> 00:51:34,679
January 9. What do you know?
Here comes Babe in the T-craft on skis!

498
00:51:35,221 --> 00:51:38,121
He brought a burlap sack
half full of beans,

499
00:51:38,122 --> 00:51:41,722
50 pounds of sugar,
and a big box of dried apples.

500
00:51:42,607 --> 00:51:44,427
Also, some mail.

501
00:51:46,554 --> 00:51:49,154
He also brought me
two pairs of heavy socks

502
00:51:49,155 --> 00:51:51,755
that his wife Mary had knitted for me.

503
00:51:52,146 --> 00:51:54,246
It was just like Christmas.

504
00:52:00,197 --> 00:52:06,697
February 21. Plus 26 degrees.
Snowing and blowing.

505
00:52:07,054 --> 00:52:09,154
27 inches of snow on the ground.

506
00:52:11,488 --> 00:52:14,088
My snowshovel works well.

507
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:18,389
My paths are beginning to look like
small canyons with steep white walls.

508
00:52:20,403 --> 00:52:25,203
I wish brother Jake could be up here to see this.

509
00:52:27,079 --> 00:52:32,079
February is almost gone,
and that didn't take long.

510
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:36,580
Snow depth still stays at 27 inches
at my checking station.

511
00:52:37,273 --> 00:52:39,373
It settles between snows.

512
00:52:44,484 --> 00:52:47,984
On the way back to the cabin,
I cut across the wolverine track.

513
00:52:48,873 --> 00:52:51,673
The one that's been eluding me for so long.

514
00:52:53,371 --> 00:52:58,871
And then, there he was. The one with the
ferocious reputation.

515
00:53:02,782 --> 00:53:05,882
He didn't look so ferocious to me.

516
00:53:16,191 --> 00:53:20,091
It was very warm in the sun, but cool
in the shadow of the mountain

517
00:53:20,092 --> 00:53:22,392
as I snowshoed back to the cabin.

518
00:53:26,285 --> 00:53:29,785
The end of march. The sun
was warm and the eave dripped.

519
00:53:31,012 --> 00:53:34,512
I do believe the days of snow and ice are numbered.

520
00:53:37,724 --> 00:53:42,524
On one of my trips I had noticed
a huge burrow on a dead spruce tree.

521
00:53:42,881 --> 00:53:44,981
Today I would go back and salvage it.

522
00:53:45,293 --> 00:53:48,293
I slapped it with a four-inch cut next to the tree.

523
00:53:48,662 --> 00:53:54,462
The cap would be about 7 inches deep,
and perhaps from that I'd carve a bowl.

524
00:53:55,579 --> 00:54:00,079
Two slabs on the packboard,
and in for lunch.

525
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:03,380
The slabs will make interesting table tops.

526
00:54:03,743 --> 00:54:08,563
After lunch I dumped the two-pound
coffee can of cranberries I had picked,

527
00:54:08,564 --> 00:54:11,564
into a pan to cook them in their own juice.

528
00:54:11,809 --> 00:54:16,609
A fistful of sugar was next,
followed with a shot of corn syrup.

529
00:54:17,878 --> 00:54:21,378
When the mixture cooled, I poured it off into empty bottles.

530
00:54:22,096 --> 00:54:24,396
Now those sourdough pancakes

531
00:54:24,397 --> 00:54:27,097
would have an elegant topping
in the morning.

532
00:54:34,903 --> 00:54:39,403
April 22. It is good to
see bears on the mountain again-

533
00:54:40,528 --> 00:54:46,528
-a mother and two fine looking cubs.
Good company for a man out here.

534
00:54:46,973 --> 00:54:49,973
Most people would think of bear den to be a smelly place.

535
00:54:50,436 --> 00:54:55,036
On the contrary, I have
found them to be clean and fresh.

536
00:54:55,037 --> 00:55:01,937
As if the bear walked in,
laid down, got up, and walked out.

537
00:55:05,898 --> 00:55:11,098
With the receding snow, the caribou
are starting to show themselves again.

538
00:55:11,589 --> 00:55:14,389
And I'm sure the wolves are not too far behind.

539
00:55:15,954 --> 00:55:18,754
There are many ptarmigan in the willowflats.

540
00:55:19,054 --> 00:55:21,054
The roosters are full of cackle,

541
00:55:21,055 --> 00:55:23,855
and they are fast coming
out of their winter plumage.

542
00:55:35,504 --> 00:55:38,504
I have made it through my first winter at Twin Lakes.

543
00:55:39,176 --> 00:55:41,076
With the arrival of spring,

544
00:55:41,077 --> 00:55:44,977
it feels good to get back to work
on the projects that have been on hold.

545
00:55:46,358 --> 00:55:50,858
And the new cache will keep bears and
other critters out of my food supplies.

546
00:55:53,699 --> 00:55:58,199
Dick Proenneke would spend the next
35 years alone in the wilderness-

547
00:55:59,016 --> 00:56:04,116
-carefully documenting life at Twin Lakes until 1998.

548
00:56:05,169 --> 00:56:10,069
At the age of 82, Dick decided
that the minus fifty below winters

549
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:13,070
were becoming too much of a chore--

550
00:56:13,162 --> 00:56:16,062
--and it was time to leave this
One Man's Wilderness.

551
00:56:16,672 --> 00:56:20,072
Dick has since formally
entrusted his homestead

552
00:56:20,073 --> 00:56:23,073
to the Park Service
of Lake Clark National Park.

553
00:56:23,612 --> 00:56:27,112
His cabin will be maintained as a historic site.

554
00:56:27,786 --> 00:56:31,886
And he may return to stay in it at any time he wishes.

555
00:56:32,165 --> 00:56:34,765
And while he may not make the trip physically again--

556
00:56:35,213 --> 00:56:42,713
--his spirit will always linger
in the perfect notches of his logs.

557
00:57:24,014 --> 00:57:27,514
