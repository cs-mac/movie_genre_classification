1
00:00:30,344 --> 00:00:34,337
I need a father who's a role model,
not some horny geek boy...

2
00:00:34,414 --> 00:00:39,044
who's going to spray his shorts whenever
I bring a girlfriend home from school.

3
00:00:40,654 --> 00:00:43,088
What a lame-o.

4
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:49,386
Someone really should just put
him out of his misery.

5
00:00:51,698 --> 00:00:54,895
You want me to kill him for you?

6
00:01:01,908 --> 00:01:04,433
Yeah. Would you?

7
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:20,253
My name is Lester Burnham.

8
00:01:20,327 --> 00:01:23,490
This is my neighborhood.

9
00:01:23,563 --> 00:01:26,498
This is my street.

10
00:01:26,566 --> 00:01:29,433
This is my life.

11
00:01:29,503 --> 00:01:34,497
I'm 42 years old.
In less than a year, l'll be dead.

12
00:01:41,581 --> 00:01:44,846
Of course, I don't know that yet.

13
00:01:48,121 --> 00:01:52,421
And in a way, I'm dead already.

14
00:02:02,102 --> 00:02:05,731
Look at me: jerking off in the shower.

15
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:12,607
This will be the high point of my day.
It's all downhill from here.

16
00:02:17,117 --> 00:02:20,280
That's my wife, Carolyn.

17
00:02:20,353 --> 00:02:25,347
See the way the handle on those pruning
shears matches her gardening clogs?

18
00:02:25,425 --> 00:02:28,485
That's not an accident.

19
00:02:28,562 --> 00:02:31,087
Hush, Bitsy!

20
00:02:31,164 --> 00:02:35,066
- Hush. What is wrong with you?
- That's our next-door neighbor, Jim.

21
00:02:35,135 --> 00:02:39,071
And that's his lover, Jim.

22
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:42,631
- You spoil her. Bitsy, no bark. Come inside now.
- Me?

23
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:45,678
- Come on. Yes. Inside.
- Good morning, Jim!

24
00:02:45,745 --> 00:02:47,906
Good morning, Carolyn.

25
00:02:47,981 --> 00:02:52,213
I love your tie!
That color!

26
00:02:52,285 --> 00:02:56,779
I just love your roses. How do you
get them to flourish like this?

27
00:02:56,857 --> 00:03:00,588
Well, l'll tell you:
eggshells and Miracle-Gro.

28
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:05,188
- I've never heard that.
- Man, I get exhausted just watching her.

29
00:03:05,265 --> 00:03:09,326
She wasn't always like this.
She used to be happy.

30
00:03:11,838 --> 00:03:15,171
We used to be happy.

31
00:03:15,242 --> 00:03:19,372
My daughter Jane.
Only child.

32
00:03:21,882 --> 00:03:25,181
Janie's a pretty typical teenager:

33
00:03:25,252 --> 00:03:29,484
angry, insecure, confused.

34
00:03:29,556 --> 00:03:34,789
I wish I could tell her that's all going to pass,
but I don't want to lie to her.

35
00:03:38,665 --> 00:03:41,896
Jane, honey, are you trying
to look unattractive?

36
00:03:41,968 --> 00:03:46,132
- Yes.
- Congratulations. You've succeeded admirably.

37
00:03:46,206 --> 00:03:50,700
Lester, could you make me a little later, please,
because I'm not quite late enough.

38
00:03:53,914 --> 00:03:56,382
Nice going, Dad.

39
00:03:56,449 --> 00:04:00,681
Both my wife and daughter think
I'm this gigantic loser.

40
00:04:00,754 --> 00:04:03,746
And they're right.

41
00:04:03,823 --> 00:04:07,224
I have lost something.

42
00:04:07,294 --> 00:04:10,354
I'm not exactly sure what it is,

43
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,991
but I know I didn't always feel this...

44
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:16,001
sedated.

45
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:18,799
But you know what?

46
00:04:18,872 --> 00:04:23,400
It's never too late to get it back.

47
00:04:23,843 --> 00:04:26,778
Hello. This is Lester Burnham from
Media Monthly magazine.

48
00:04:26,846 --> 00:04:29,906
I'm calling for Mr. Tamblin, please.

49
00:04:29,983 --> 00:04:33,578
Well, we're all under a deadline here.
You see, there's some basic information...

50
00:04:33,653 --> 00:04:38,090
about your product launch that isn't even
covered in your press release, and I'd...

51
00:04:38,158 --> 00:04:41,025
Yeah, c... can I ask you a question?

52
00:04:41,094 --> 00:04:45,554
Who is Tamblin? Does he exist?
'Cause he doesn't ever seem to come in.

53
00:04:45,632 --> 00:04:48,465
Yeah. Okay.
l'll leave my number.

54
00:04:48,535 --> 00:04:52,972
It's 555-0199.

55
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:56,566
Lester Burnham.
Thank you!

56
00:04:58,044 --> 00:05:02,140
Hey, Les.
You got a minute?

57
00:05:02,215 --> 00:05:05,912
For you, Brad, I got five!

58
00:05:05,986 --> 00:05:10,480
So, yeah, I'm sure you can understand
our need to cut corners around here.

59
00:05:10,557 --> 00:05:12,684
Oh, sure.
Times are tight.

60
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:16,160
You got to free up some cash.
You got to spend money to make money.

61
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:19,096
- Right?
- Exactly.

62
00:05:19,165 --> 00:05:23,101
Like the time that Mr. Flournoy used the company
MasterCard to pay for that hooker,

63
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:27,333
and she used the card numbers and stayed at
the St. Regis for, what was it, three months?

64
00:05:27,407 --> 00:05:31,468
- That's unsubstantiated gossip.
- That's $50,000. That's somebody's salary.

65
00:05:31,544 --> 00:05:34,638
That's somebody who's going to get fired because
Craig has to pay women to fuck him!

66
00:05:34,714 --> 00:05:36,705
Jesus!

67
00:05:36,783 --> 00:05:40,480
I mean, calm down.
Nobody's getting fired yet.

68
00:05:40,553 --> 00:05:43,021
That's why we're having everyone...

69
00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:47,583
write out a job description mapping
out in detail how they contribute.

70
00:05:47,661 --> 00:05:51,427
That way management can
assess who's valuable...

71
00:05:51,498 --> 00:05:54,228
And who's expendable.

72
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,996
It's just business.

73
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:00,335
I've been writing for this magazine for 14 years.

74
00:06:00,407 --> 00:06:04,639
- You've been here how long? A whole month?
- I'm one of the good guys, Les.

75
00:06:04,711 --> 00:06:07,578
I'm trying to level with you.

76
00:06:07,647 --> 00:06:11,139
This is your one chance
to save your job.

77
00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:15,449
There is no decision.
You just write the damn thing.

78
00:06:15,522 --> 00:06:18,548
- You don't think it's weird and kind of fascist?
- Possibly.

79
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,593
- But you don't want to be unemployed.
- All right.

80
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,390
Let's just all sell our souls and work for
Satan 'cause it's more convenient that way.

81
00:06:23,463 --> 00:06:26,489
Oh, could you be a little bit more
dramatic, please, huh?

82
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:28,796
So, we finally got new neighbors.

83
00:06:28,868 --> 00:06:33,464
You know, if the Lomans had let me represent
them instead of the Real Estate King,

84
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,065
that house would never have sat
on the market for six months.

85
00:06:36,142 --> 00:06:38,906
Well, they were still mad at you for
cutting down their sycamore.

86
00:06:38,978 --> 00:06:41,572
Their sycamore?
Come on.

87
00:06:41,648 --> 00:06:44,344
A substantial portion of the root
structure was on our property.

88
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:47,409
You know that.
How can you call it their sycamore?

89
00:06:47,487 --> 00:06:52,584
I wouldn't have the heart to just cut down something
if it wasn't partially mine, which, of course, it was.

90
00:06:54,828 --> 00:06:58,889
Bali Ha'i

91
00:06:58,965 --> 00:07:01,695
They call you

92
00:07:01,768 --> 00:07:06,796
Mom, do we always have to listen
to this elevator music?

93
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:10,607
No. No, we don't.

94
00:07:10,677 --> 00:07:14,613
And as soon you've prepared a nutritious
yet savory meal that I'm about to eat,

95
00:07:14,681 --> 00:07:17,616
you can listen to whatever you like.

96
00:07:20,687 --> 00:07:24,589
So, Janie, how was school?

97
00:07:24,657 --> 00:07:27,023
It was okay.

98
00:07:27,093 --> 00:07:29,527
Just okay?

99
00:07:29,596 --> 00:07:33,692
No, Dad. It was spectacular.

100
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:39,604
Well, you want to know how things
went in my job today?

101
00:07:39,672 --> 00:07:42,072
They've hired this efficiency expert,

102
00:07:42,142 --> 00:07:44,872
this really friendly guy named Brad...

103
00:07:44,944 --> 00:07:49,381
How perfect is that? And he's basically there
to make it seem they're justified...

104
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:52,907
in firing somebody, because they couldn't
just come out and say that, could they?

105
00:07:52,986 --> 00:07:56,319
No, no. That would just be too honest.
So they've asked us...

106
00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:59,881
You couldn't possibly care less, could you?

107
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:02,086
What do you expect?

108
00:08:02,162 --> 00:08:06,428
You can't all of a sudden be my best friend
just because you had a bad day.

109
00:08:08,101 --> 00:08:12,265
I mean, hello, you've barely even
spoken to me for months.

110
00:08:17,844 --> 00:08:21,371
Oh, what?
You're "Mother of the Year"?

111
00:08:21,447 --> 00:08:24,905
- You treat her like an employee.
- What?

112
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,618
What?

113
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:32,351
I'm going to get some ice cream.

114
00:08:41,034 --> 00:08:43,002
Janie...

115
00:08:44,237 --> 00:08:49,174
I'm sorry I haven't been more available.

116
00:08:49,242 --> 00:08:51,472
I'm just... I...

117
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:57,716
You know, you don't always have
to wait for me to come to you.

118
00:08:57,784 --> 00:09:00,844
Oh, great.
So now it's my fault?

119
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,321
I didn't say that.
It's nobody's fault. It...

120
00:09:05,525 --> 00:09:08,790
Janie, what happened?
We used to be pals.

121
00:10:48,695 --> 00:10:51,721
I will sell this house today.

122
00:11:02,141 --> 00:11:07,101
I will sell this house today.
I will sell this house today.

123
00:11:21,027 --> 00:11:24,053
I will sell this house today.

124
00:11:32,138 --> 00:11:34,936
Welcome. I'm Carolyn Burnham.

125
00:11:35,008 --> 00:11:38,068
This living room is very dramatic.

126
00:11:38,144 --> 00:11:41,045
Wait till you see the native stone fireplace!

127
00:11:41,114 --> 00:11:46,609
A simple cream could really lighten things up.
You could even put in a skylight.

128
00:11:49,355 --> 00:11:51,482
Well, why don't we go into the kitchen?

129
00:11:51,557 --> 00:11:54,958
It's a dream come true for any cook.

130
00:11:55,028 --> 00:11:58,395
Just filled with positive energy, huh?

131
00:11:58,464 --> 00:12:03,959
And you'll be surprised how much a ceiling fan
can cut down on your energy costs.

132
00:12:06,906 --> 00:12:11,570
You know, you could have some fun
backyard get-togethers out here.

133
00:12:11,644 --> 00:12:15,045
The ad said this pool was lagoon-like.
There's nothing lagoon-like about it.

134
00:12:15,114 --> 00:12:19,574
Except for maybe the bugs.
There aren't even any plants out here.

135
00:12:19,652 --> 00:12:22,587
What do you call this?
Is this not a plant?

136
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:26,091
If you have a problem with the plants,
I can always call my landscape architect.

137
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:30,755
- Solved.
- I mean, I think "lagoon," I think waterfall, tropical.

138
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:33,765
This is a cement hole.

139
00:12:34,901 --> 00:12:36,835
Uh...

140
00:12:36,903 --> 00:12:40,031
I have some tiki torches in the garage.

141
00:13:11,571 --> 00:13:15,337
Shut up! Stop it!
You weak... You baby!

142
00:13:15,408 --> 00:13:18,377
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up!

143
00:14:03,489 --> 00:14:05,650
Who are you looking for?

144
00:14:05,725 --> 00:14:08,353
My parents are coming tonight.

145
00:14:08,427 --> 00:14:12,090
They're trying to, you know,
take an active interest in me.

146
00:14:12,165 --> 00:14:15,134
Gross. I hate it when my mom does that.

147
00:14:15,201 --> 00:14:19,228
They're such assholes. Why can't
they just have their own lives?

148
00:14:22,175 --> 00:14:26,305
What makes you sure she wants us to
be there? Did she ask us to come?

149
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:29,780
Of course not. She doesn't want us
to know how important this is to her.

150
00:14:29,849 --> 00:14:32,010
But she's been practicing for weeks.

151
00:14:32,084 --> 00:14:36,384
l'll bet she's going to resent it, and I'm missing
the James Bond marathon on T.N.T.

152
00:14:36,455 --> 00:14:41,483
Lester, this is important. I'm sensing a real
distance growing between you and Jane.

153
00:14:41,561 --> 00:14:44,394
"Growing"?
She hates me.

154
00:14:44,463 --> 00:14:48,456
- She's just willful.
- She hates you too.

155
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,469
- Excuse me. Sorry. I'm sorry.
- Pardon me.

156
00:14:59,545 --> 00:15:02,036
Hi! Patty!

157
00:15:02,114 --> 00:15:05,083
Now, for your halftime entertainment,

158
00:15:05,151 --> 00:15:09,485
Rockwell High's award-winning
Dancing Spartanettes!

159
00:15:09,555 --> 00:15:12,183
We can leave right after this, right?

160
00:17:25,725 --> 00:17:28,353
Shit. They're still here.

161
00:17:28,427 --> 00:17:30,520
Janie!

162
00:17:30,596 --> 00:17:32,791
Hey, I really enjoyed that.

163
00:17:32,865 --> 00:17:35,857
- Congratulations, honey. You were great.
- I didn't win anything.

164
00:17:35,935 --> 00:17:39,564
- Hi. I'm Lester, Janie's dad.
- Oh, hi.

165
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,870
This is my friend, Angela Hayes.

166
00:17:44,944 --> 00:17:48,311
Okay. Good to meet you.

167
00:17:48,381 --> 00:17:53,683
You were also good tonight,
very... precise.

168
00:17:53,753 --> 00:17:56,688
- Thanks.
- Nice to meet you, Angela.

169
00:17:56,756 --> 00:17:59,486
Honey... I am so proud of you.

170
00:17:59,558 --> 00:18:03,358
You know, I watched you very closely.
You didn't screw up once.

171
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:07,627
Okay, uh, we have to go.

172
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,260
- So what are you girls doing now?
- Dad.

173
00:18:10,336 --> 00:18:13,601
- We're going out for pizza.
- Really? Do you need a ride? We can give you a ride.

174
00:18:13,672 --> 00:18:17,369
- I have a car. You want to come with us?
- Thanks, but I have a car.

175
00:18:17,443 --> 00:18:21,277
You have a car.
That's great. That's great.

176
00:18:21,347 --> 00:18:24,214
Janie's thinking about getting a car,
too, soon, aren't you?

177
00:18:24,283 --> 00:18:27,616
Dad, Mom's waiting for you.

178
00:18:29,622 --> 00:18:32,250
Well, it was very nice meeting you, Angela.

179
00:18:32,324 --> 00:18:34,792
Any friend of Janie's...

180
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:39,354
is a... friend of mine.

181
00:18:42,535 --> 00:18:46,471
Well... l'll be seeing you around, then.

182
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:54,973
Could he be any more... pathetic?

183
00:18:55,047 --> 00:18:58,016
I think he's sweet.

184
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:03,282
And I think he and your mother
have not had sex in a long time.

185
00:19:19,772 --> 00:19:22,866
It's the weirdest thing.

186
00:19:22,942 --> 00:19:26,400
I feel like I've been in a coma
for about 20 years...

187
00:19:26,479 --> 00:19:29,642
and I'm just now waking up.

188
00:20:00,012 --> 00:20:03,379
Spec-tacular.

189
00:20:12,258 --> 00:20:15,625
I'm so sorry my dad was weird tonight.

190
00:20:17,563 --> 00:20:19,554
That's okay.

191
00:20:19,632 --> 00:20:21,964
I'm used to guys drooling over me.

192
00:20:23,035 --> 00:20:25,503
It started when I was about 12.

193
00:20:25,571 --> 00:20:28,699
I'd go to dinner with my parents.

194
00:20:28,774 --> 00:20:31,902
Every Thursday night: Red Lobster.

195
00:20:31,977 --> 00:20:34,946
Every guy there would stare at me
when I walked in.

196
00:20:35,014 --> 00:20:37,175
And I knew what they were thinking,

197
00:20:37,249 --> 00:20:41,185
just like I knew guys at school thought
about me when they jerked off.

198
00:20:41,253 --> 00:20:44,051
- Vomit.
- No. I liked it.

199
00:20:44,123 --> 00:20:48,685
I still like it. If people I don't even know
look at me and want to fuck me,

200
00:20:48,761 --> 00:20:52,959
it means I really have a shot
at being a model.

201
00:20:53,032 --> 00:20:55,330
Which is great,

202
00:20:55,401 --> 00:20:59,462
because there's nothing worse in life
than being ordinary.

203
00:21:03,742 --> 00:21:06,176
I really think it'll happen for you.

204
00:21:07,246 --> 00:21:09,180
I know.

205
00:21:09,248 --> 00:21:13,912
Because everything that was meant
to happen, does... eventually.

206
00:21:38,544 --> 00:21:41,069
Asshole.

207
00:22:46,278 --> 00:22:49,736
Hello? Hello?

208
00:23:05,964 --> 00:23:08,228
- Hello?
- Why'd you call me?

209
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,234
I didn't.

210
00:23:10,302 --> 00:23:12,862
Well, my phone just rang and
I answered it, and somebody hung up.

211
00:23:12,938 --> 00:23:17,534
- And I star-69ed, and I called you back.
- Well, I was in the shower.

212
00:23:21,413 --> 00:23:23,540
Oh, gross!

213
00:23:39,398 --> 00:23:42,026
Ricky! Breakfast!

214
00:23:43,702 --> 00:23:46,136
Be right there.

215
00:23:54,346 --> 00:23:56,211
- Mom.
- Hello.

216
00:23:56,281 --> 00:23:59,648
I don't eat bacon, remember?

217
00:24:00,819 --> 00:24:03,754
I'm sorry.
I must've forgotten.

218
00:24:13,866 --> 00:24:16,835
What's new in the world, Dad?

219
00:24:16,902 --> 00:24:20,702
This country is going straight to hell.

220
00:24:27,713 --> 00:24:30,580
- Are you expecting anyone?
- No.

221
00:24:33,585 --> 00:24:35,917
No.

222
00:24:42,761 --> 00:24:44,956
- Hi.
- Welcome to the neighborhood.

223
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:47,225
- It's just a little something from our garden.
- Except for the pasta.

224
00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:49,927
- We got that at Fallaci's.
- Right. It's unbelievably fresh.

225
00:24:50,002 --> 00:24:53,631
You just... You drop it
in the water, and it's done.

226
00:24:53,705 --> 00:24:57,539
Jim Olmeyer. Two doors down.
Welcome to the neighborhood.

227
00:24:57,609 --> 00:24:59,975
Colonel Frank Fitts, U.S. Marine Corps.

228
00:25:00,045 --> 00:25:03,674
- It's nice to meet you. This is my partner...
- Jim Berkley, but call me J.B.

229
00:25:03,749 --> 00:25:07,048
Let's cut to chase, okay?
What are you guys selling?

230
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:11,215
- We...
- Nothing. We just wanted to say hi to our new neighbors.

231
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:16,819
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You said you're partners,
so what's your business?

232
00:25:18,463 --> 00:25:22,490
Well... he is a tax attorney.

233
00:25:22,568 --> 00:25:25,537
And he's an anesthesiologist.

234
00:25:34,246 --> 00:25:38,706
How come these faggots always
have to rub it in your face?

235
00:25:38,784 --> 00:25:41,844
How can they be so shameless?

236
00:25:43,322 --> 00:25:46,553
That's the whole thing, Dad.

237
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:49,924
They don't feel that's anything
to be ashamed of.

238
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:53,520
Well, it is.

239
00:25:55,234 --> 00:25:59,568
- Yeah, you're right.
- Don't placate me like I'm your mother, boy.

240
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:05,408
Forgive me, sir, for speaking so bluntly,

241
00:26:05,477 --> 00:26:08,503
but those fags make me want
to puke my fucking guts out.

242
00:26:16,288 --> 00:26:21,453
Well, me too, son.
Yeah. Me too.

243
00:26:26,965 --> 00:26:30,457
I'm serious. He just pulled down his
pants and yanked it out.

244
00:26:30,535 --> 00:26:34,232
- You know, like, "Say hello to Mr. Happy."
- Gross!

245
00:26:34,306 --> 00:26:39,141
- It wasn't gross. It was kind of cool.
- So did you do it with him?

246
00:26:39,211 --> 00:26:43,545
Of course. He's a really
well-known photographer.

247
00:26:43,615 --> 00:26:46,413
He shoots for Elle on, like, a regular basis.

248
00:26:46,485 --> 00:26:51,252
- It would've been majorly stupid of me to turn him down.
- You are a total prostitute.

249
00:26:51,323 --> 00:26:55,453
Hey, that's how things really are.

250
00:26:55,527 --> 00:26:59,361
You just don't know because you're
this pampered little suburban chick.

251
00:26:59,431 --> 00:27:03,026
So are you. You've only been
in Seventeen once, and you looked fat.

252
00:27:03,101 --> 00:27:06,764
So stop acting like you're goddamn Christy Turlington!

253
00:27:09,107 --> 00:27:11,041
Cunt!

254
00:27:12,511 --> 00:27:16,003
I am so sick of people taking
their insecurities out on me.

255
00:27:17,716 --> 00:27:22,016
- Oh, my God. That's the pervert who filmed me last night.
- Him?

256
00:27:22,087 --> 00:27:25,147
Jane. No way.
He's a total lunatic.

257
00:27:25,223 --> 00:27:27,157
- Do you know him?
- Yeah.

258
00:27:27,225 --> 00:27:29,420
We were on the same lunch shift
when I was in ninth grade,

259
00:27:29,494 --> 00:27:33,055
and he would always save
the most random, weird things.

260
00:27:33,131 --> 00:27:37,534
And then one day, he was just, like, gone.

261
00:27:37,602 --> 00:27:43,438
And then Connie Cardullo told me that his parents
had to put him in a mental institution.

262
00:27:43,508 --> 00:27:45,669
Why? What did he do?

263
00:27:45,744 --> 00:27:48,645
What do you mean?

264
00:27:48,714 --> 00:27:52,810
Well, they can't put you away
just for saying weird things.

265
00:27:55,253 --> 00:28:00,384
You total slut.
You've got a crush on him.

266
00:28:00,459 --> 00:28:03,257
- What? Please!
- You are defending him. You love him.

267
00:28:03,328 --> 00:28:06,627
- You want to have, like, 10,000 of his babies.
- Shut up.

268
00:28:06,698 --> 00:28:10,998
Hi. My name's Ricky.
I just moved next door to you.

269
00:28:11,069 --> 00:28:13,094
I know.

270
00:28:13,171 --> 00:28:17,301
I kind of remember this creepy incident
where you were filming me last night?

271
00:28:17,376 --> 00:28:21,472
- I didn't mean to scare you. I just think you're interesting.
- Thanks.

272
00:28:21,546 --> 00:28:26,176
But I really don't need to have some psycho
obsessing about me right now.

273
00:28:27,252 --> 00:28:31,211
I'm not obsessing.
I'm just curious.

274
00:28:46,371 --> 00:28:48,339
What a freak.

275
00:28:48,407 --> 00:28:51,740
And why does he dress
like a Bible salesman?

276
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:54,938
He's, like, so confident.

277
00:28:55,013 --> 00:28:58,073
That can't be real.

278
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:00,710
I don't believe him.

279
00:29:00,786 --> 00:29:04,847
I mean, he didn't even,
like, look at me once.

280
00:29:09,995 --> 00:29:14,091
- How'd you get in the Army?
- Sergeant, I got three reasons for being in the Army.

281
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:18,193
First, I'm patriotic. Second, I love
my country. And third, they nailed me.

282
00:29:32,617 --> 00:29:34,551
Hey.

283
00:29:37,622 --> 00:29:41,319
- What's going on here?
- Bend all the way down. Here comes the Bull of the Woods.

284
00:29:44,229 --> 00:29:46,823
I'm sorry. What?

285
00:29:47,899 --> 00:29:50,299
Mom, nobody said anything.

286
00:29:50,368 --> 00:29:52,802
Oh. I'm sorry.

287
00:29:59,678 --> 00:30:01,373
Everyone here is with their spouse
or significant other.

288
00:30:01,446 --> 00:30:04,506
- How would it look if I showed up with no one?
- You always end up ignoring me.

289
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:08,075
Now, listen to me.
This is an important business function.

290
00:30:08,153 --> 00:30:11,350
As you know, my business
is selling an image,

291
00:30:11,423 --> 00:30:13,755
and part of my job is to live that image.

292
00:30:13,825 --> 00:30:18,319
Honey, do me a favor and say whatever you
want to say and spare me the propaganda.

293
00:30:18,396 --> 00:30:21,297
All right. Hi, Shirley!

294
00:30:22,834 --> 00:30:25,735
Listen. Just do me a favor.
Act happy tonight.

295
00:30:25,804 --> 00:30:30,605
- I am happy, honey!
- You're not... Oh, that's Buddy!

296
00:30:30,675 --> 00:30:34,167
- Buddy! Buddy! Hi!
- Hi.

297
00:30:34,246 --> 00:30:36,714
Good to see you again.

298
00:30:36,781 --> 00:30:40,308
- It's so good to see you too, Catherine.
- Carolyn.

299
00:30:40,385 --> 00:30:43,354
Oh, Carolyn! Of course.
How are you?

300
00:30:43,421 --> 00:30:47,357
- Very well, thank you. Hello, Christy.
- Hello.

301
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,427
- My husband, Lester.
- It's a pleasure.

302
00:30:51,496 --> 00:30:56,627
Oh, we've met before, actually. This thing last year.
Christmas at the Sheraton.

303
00:30:56,701 --> 00:30:58,999
Oh, yeah!

304
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:02,164
Oh, it's okay.
I wouldn't remember me either.

305
00:31:06,244 --> 00:31:08,735
Honey, don't be weird.

306
00:31:08,813 --> 00:31:11,680
- All right, honey. I won't be weird.
- Okay.

307
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:14,981
l'll be whatever you want me to be.

308
00:31:15,053 --> 00:31:17,578
Well, oka...

309
00:31:27,432 --> 00:31:31,528
- We have a very healthy relationship.
- I see.

310
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:38,068
Well, I don't know about you guys,
but I need a drink.

311
00:31:38,143 --> 00:31:40,839
Ohh.

312
00:31:43,348 --> 00:31:46,408
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Put a little more in there, cowboy.

313
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:07,602
Excuse me. Don't you live on Robin Hood
Trail? The house with the red door?

314
00:32:07,672 --> 00:32:12,609
- Yeah.
- I'm Ricky Fitts. I just moved in the house next to you.

315
00:32:12,677 --> 00:32:16,943
Oh. Hi, Ricky Fitts.
I'm Lester Burnham.

316
00:32:17,015 --> 00:32:19,540
Hi, Lester Burnham.

317
00:32:29,661 --> 00:32:33,097
- Do you party?
- Excuse me?

318
00:32:33,164 --> 00:32:36,361
Do you get high?

319
00:32:38,903 --> 00:32:43,636
You know, I probably wouldn't even tell you
this if I weren't a little tipsy, but...

320
00:32:45,176 --> 00:32:48,009
I'm in complete awe of you.

321
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:50,513
I mean, your firm...

322
00:32:50,582 --> 00:32:54,575
is hands-down the Rolls-Royce
of local real estate firms,

323
00:32:54,653 --> 00:32:58,180
and your personal sales record is...

324
00:32:58,256 --> 00:33:02,317
It's very intimidating.

325
00:33:02,394 --> 00:33:07,388
You know, I'd love to sit down with
you and just pick your brain,

326
00:33:07,465 --> 00:33:10,332
If you'd ever be willing.

327
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:15,428
You know, I suppose technically
I'm the competition,

328
00:33:15,507 --> 00:33:19,238
but I mean, hey,
I don't flatter myself...

329
00:33:19,311 --> 00:33:22,838
that I'm even in the same league as you.

330
00:33:22,914 --> 00:33:25,144
I don't.

331
00:33:25,216 --> 00:33:27,150
I'd love to.

332
00:33:28,753 --> 00:33:31,688
- Really?
- Absolutely.

333
00:33:31,756 --> 00:33:35,021
Call my secretary.
Have her schedule a lunch.

334
00:33:36,594 --> 00:33:39,392
l'll do that.
Thank you.

335
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:49,062
Did you ever see that movie where
the body is walking around...

336
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:52,371
carrying its own head, and then
the head goes down on that babe?

337
00:33:52,444 --> 00:33:55,311
Re-Animator.

338
00:33:57,549 --> 00:33:59,540
Look.

339
00:33:59,617 --> 00:34:02,984
I'm not paying you to do whatever
it is you're doing out here.

340
00:34:03,054 --> 00:34:05,989
Fine. So don't pay me.

341
00:34:06,057 --> 00:34:08,150
Excuse me?

342
00:34:08,226 --> 00:34:13,163
I quit, so you don't have
to pay me. Now leave me alone.

343
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,664
Asshole.

344
00:34:22,307 --> 00:34:25,504
I think you just became my personal hero.

345
00:34:25,577 --> 00:34:29,035
Doesn't that make you nervous,
just quitting your job like that?

346
00:34:30,782 --> 00:34:33,979
Well, I guess when you're all of, what, 16...

347
00:34:34,052 --> 00:34:38,546
Eighteen. I just do these gigs as a cover.

348
00:34:38,623 --> 00:34:41,683
I have other sources of income.

349
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,422
But my dad interferes less
in my life when I pretend...

350
00:34:44,496 --> 00:34:47,829
to be an upstanding young citizen
with a respectable job.

351
00:34:47,899 --> 00:34:49,992
Lester?

352
00:34:52,837 --> 00:34:57,035
- What are you doing?
- Honey, this is... Ricky Fitts.

353
00:34:57,108 --> 00:35:00,976
This is Ricky Fitts.

354
00:35:03,381 --> 00:35:06,407
I'm Ricky Fitts. I just moved
into the house next to you.

355
00:35:06,484 --> 00:35:09,476
I go to school
with your daughter.

356
00:35:09,554 --> 00:35:12,182
- With Jane?
- Yeah.

357
00:35:12,257 --> 00:35:14,987
- Really?
- Jane.

358
00:35:15,059 --> 00:35:19,655
Hi. I'm ready to go.
l'll meet you out front.

359
00:35:23,701 --> 00:35:27,660
Oh, I'm in trouble.

360
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,134
Nice meeting you, Ricky.
Thanks for the thing.

361
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:35,077
Anytime. Lester?

362
00:35:35,146 --> 00:35:38,741
If you want any more,
you know where I live.

363
00:35:52,197 --> 00:35:56,566
Oh, shit. They're home. Quick.
Let's go up to my room.

364
00:35:56,634 --> 00:35:59,125
I should say hi to your dad.

365
00:35:59,204 --> 00:36:02,298
I don't want to be rude.

366
00:36:14,018 --> 00:36:16,248
Nice suit.

367
00:36:17,355 --> 00:36:19,380
You're looking good,
Mr. Burnham.

368
00:36:19,457 --> 00:36:23,188
Last time I saw you,
you looked kind of wound up.

369
00:36:26,931 --> 00:36:29,195
Ooh, is that root beer?

370
00:37:28,793 --> 00:37:30,852
I love root beer, don't you?

371
00:37:33,331 --> 00:37:35,265
- Hey.
- Hi, Mom.

372
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:37,528
- Hi.
- Remember Angela?

373
00:37:37,602 --> 00:37:39,729
Yes, of course.

374
00:37:39,804 --> 00:37:43,535
I forgot to tell you. She's going to
spend the night. Is that okay?

375
00:37:51,449 --> 00:37:55,044
- Sorry about my dad.
- Don't be. I think it's funny.

376
00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:00,182
Yeah, to you he's just another guy
who wants to jump your bones.

377
00:38:00,258 --> 00:38:05,093
But to me, he's just...
too embarrassing to live.

378
00:38:06,564 --> 00:38:10,330
Well, your mom's the one who's
embarrassing. What a phony.

379
00:38:10,401 --> 00:38:13,666
- But your dad's actually kind of cute.
- Shut up.

380
00:38:13,738 --> 00:38:17,504
He is. If he just worked out a little, he'd be hot.

381
00:38:17,575 --> 00:38:19,543
- Shut up!
- Come on.

382
00:38:19,611 --> 00:38:24,514
Like you've never sneaked a peek at him in
his underwear? I bet he's got a big dick.

383
00:38:24,582 --> 00:38:26,914
You are so grossing me out right now.

384
00:38:26,985 --> 00:38:30,250
If he built up his chest and arms,
I would totally fuck him.

385
00:38:30,321 --> 00:38:34,587
-  La, la, la, la, la, la
- I would. I would suck your dad's big fat dick,

386
00:38:34,659 --> 00:38:37,787
and then I'd fuck him until his
eyes rolled back in his head.

387
00:38:37,862 --> 00:38:41,525
Jane, shh. What was that noise?

388
00:38:44,202 --> 00:38:46,864
- I swear I heard something.
- Yeah.

389
00:38:46,938 --> 00:38:49,907
That was the sound of you being
a huge, disgusting pig.

390
00:38:49,974 --> 00:38:52,442
No, I'm serious.

391
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:55,274
See?

392
00:38:55,346 --> 00:38:58,645
- Oh, my God. Jane.
- What is it?

393
00:39:01,753 --> 00:39:05,189
It's that psycho next door.

394
00:39:05,256 --> 00:39:07,417
Jane, what if he worships you?

395
00:39:07,492 --> 00:39:12,657
What if he's got a shrine with pictures of you
surrounded by dead people's heads and stuff?

396
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:16,188
Shit. I bet he's filming us right now.

397
00:39:16,267 --> 00:39:18,201
Really?

398
00:40:48,826 --> 00:40:52,728
Welcome to America's Weirdest Home Videos.

399
00:41:17,188 --> 00:41:20,385
Ricky?

400
00:41:20,458 --> 00:41:22,824
Coming, Dad.

401
00:41:22,894 --> 00:41:26,421
You know I don't like
locked doors in my house, boy.

402
00:41:32,003 --> 00:41:35,598
- I'm sorry. I must've locked it by accident.
- Mm.

403
00:41:36,674 --> 00:41:39,302
So what's up?

404
00:41:41,412 --> 00:41:44,176
I... I need a urine sample.

405
00:41:44,248 --> 00:41:46,182
Wow.

406
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:48,946
It's been six months already.

407
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:52,114
Can I give it to you in the morning?
I just took a whiz.

408
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:54,317
Yeah. I suppose.

409
00:41:58,262 --> 00:42:01,026
Y-You know...

410
00:42:08,539 --> 00:42:12,373
Well, good night, son.

411
00:43:18,676 --> 00:43:20,735
I've been waiting for you.

412
00:43:41,532 --> 00:43:44,092
You've been working out, haven't you?

413
00:43:44,168 --> 00:43:46,329
I can tell.

414
00:43:47,838 --> 00:43:50,932
I was hoping you could give me a bath.

415
00:43:51,008 --> 00:43:53,533
I'm very, very dirty.

416
00:44:26,477 --> 00:44:28,741
What are you doing?

417
00:44:30,081 --> 00:44:32,106
Nothing.

418
00:44:32,183 --> 00:44:34,777
- You were masturbating.
- I was not.

419
00:44:34,852 --> 00:44:37,685
Yes, you were.

420
00:44:37,755 --> 00:44:41,521
Oh, all right. So shoot me. I was whacking off.

421
00:44:41,592 --> 00:44:45,187
That's right. I was choking
the bishop, chafing the carrot.

422
00:44:45,262 --> 00:44:48,197
You know, saying "hi" to my monster.

423
00:44:48,265 --> 00:44:50,199
That's disgusting.

424
00:44:50,267 --> 00:44:53,395
Well, excuse me, but some of us still have
blood pumping through our veins.

425
00:44:53,471 --> 00:44:55,735
- So do I.
- Really?

426
00:44:55,806 --> 00:45:00,140
Well, I'm the only one who seems
to be doing anything about it.

427
00:45:00,211 --> 00:45:03,806
Lester, I refuse to live like this!

428
00:45:03,881 --> 00:45:05,872
This is not a marriage.

429
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:09,044
This hasn't been a marriage for years,

430
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:12,089
but you were happy as long
as I kept my mouth shut.

431
00:45:12,156 --> 00:45:14,215
Well, guess what.
I've changed.

432
00:45:14,291 --> 00:45:16,885
And the new me whacks off
when he feels horny...

433
00:45:16,961 --> 00:45:19,759
'cause you're obviously not going to
help me out in that department.

434
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:22,526
I see. You think you're the only
one who's sexually frustrated.

435
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,728
I'm not? Well, then, come on, baby. I'm ready.

436
00:45:25,803 --> 00:45:27,964
Don't you mess with me, mister.

437
00:45:28,039 --> 00:45:31,202
I will divorce you so fast,
it'll make your head spin.

438
00:45:31,275 --> 00:45:33,436
On what grounds?

439
00:45:33,511 --> 00:45:36,105
I'm not a drunk.
I don't fuck other women.

440
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:38,614
I don't mistreat you.
I've never hit you.

441
00:45:38,682 --> 00:45:41,276
I don't even try to touch you,
since you made it so abundantly clear...

442
00:45:41,352 --> 00:45:43,650
just how unnecessary you consider me to be!

443
00:45:45,656 --> 00:45:49,092
But... I did support you when you got your license.

444
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:53,256
And some people might think that entitles
me to half of what's yours.

445
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:56,163
Oh!

446
00:45:56,233 --> 00:45:59,999
So, turn out the light when
you come back to bed, okay?

447
00:46:11,449 --> 00:46:17,046
It's a great thing when you realize you still
have the ability to surprise yourself.

448
00:46:17,121 --> 00:46:21,114
Makes you wonder what else you can do
that you've forgotten about.

449
00:46:21,192 --> 00:46:23,160
Hey, guys.

450
00:46:23,227 --> 00:46:25,661
Lester. I didn't know you ran.

451
00:46:25,729 --> 00:46:28,061
- I just started.
- Good for you.

452
00:46:28,132 --> 00:46:32,228
I figured you guys might be able to give me
some pointers. I need to shape up, fast.

453
00:46:32,303 --> 00:46:35,136
Are you looking to just lose weight,
or do you want to have...

454
00:46:35,206 --> 00:46:38,141
increased strength and flexibility as well?

455
00:46:38,209 --> 00:46:41,667
I... I want to look good naked.

456
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:01,259
Oh, what is this?
Fuckin' gay pride parade?

457
00:47:01,332 --> 00:47:03,425
Hey! Yo, Ricky.

458
00:47:06,837 --> 00:47:11,604
My entire life is passing before my eyes, and
those two have barely broken a sweat.

459
00:47:11,675 --> 00:47:14,974
Sorry. Hi. Lester Burnham.
I live next door. We haven't met.

460
00:47:15,045 --> 00:47:17,036
Colonel Frank Fitts, U.S. Marine Corps.

461
00:47:17,114 --> 00:47:20,208
Oh, whoa. Well.

462
00:47:20,284 --> 00:47:22,548
Welcome to the neighborhood, sir.

463
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:29,459
Ricky, uh...

464
00:47:29,527 --> 00:47:33,122
I was thinking about the, uh...
I was gonna... The movie we talked about.

465
00:47:33,197 --> 00:47:35,131
- Re-Animator.
- Yeah!

466
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:38,965
You want to borrow it?
Okay. It's up in my room. Come on.

467
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:52,574
- Can you hold this for a sec?
- Sure.

468
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:56,746
I don't think my dad would try to come in while
someone else is here, but you never know.

469
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:59,880
- What is this?
- Urine.

470
00:47:59,957 --> 00:48:04,326
I have to take a drug test every six
months just to make sure I'm clean.

471
00:48:04,395 --> 00:48:07,330
Are you kidding?
You just smoked with me last night.

472
00:48:07,398 --> 00:48:09,491
It's not mine.

473
00:48:09,567 --> 00:48:13,333
One of my clients is a nurse
in a pediatrician's office.

474
00:48:13,404 --> 00:48:16,999
Cut her a deal, she keeps me in clean piss.

475
00:48:19,076 --> 00:48:21,101
You like Pink Floyd?

476
00:48:22,646 --> 00:48:25,080
I like a lot of music.

477
00:48:26,317 --> 00:48:30,686
Man, I haven't listened
to this album in years.

478
00:48:30,754 --> 00:48:33,188
How much do you want?

479
00:48:33,257 --> 00:48:37,193
I don't know. It's been a while.
Um, how much is an ounce?

480
00:48:40,864 --> 00:48:43,799
This is totally decent, and it's 300.

481
00:48:45,035 --> 00:48:47,026
Wow!

482
00:48:47,104 --> 00:48:49,698
This shit is top of the line.

483
00:48:49,773 --> 00:48:53,436
It's called G-13. It's genetically
engineered by the U.S. government.

484
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:57,276
It's extremely potent, but
a completely mellow high. No paranoia.

485
00:48:58,349 --> 00:49:01,284
Is that what we smoked last night?

486
00:49:01,352 --> 00:49:03,980
This is all I ever smoke.

487
00:49:07,825 --> 00:49:11,317
- How much?
- Two grand.

488
00:49:11,395 --> 00:49:13,659
Jesus!

489
00:49:13,731 --> 00:49:16,598
Things have changed since 1973.

490
00:49:16,667 --> 00:49:20,398
- You don't have to pay now. I know you're good for it.
- Thanks.

491
00:49:20,471 --> 00:49:22,837
There's a card in there with my beeper number.

492
00:49:22,906 --> 00:49:26,239
Beep me anytime, day or night.

493
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:28,540
And I only accept cash.

494
00:49:28,612 --> 00:49:32,412
Now I know how you can afford
all this equipment.

495
00:49:32,483 --> 00:49:37,420
God. When I was your age, I flipped burgers
all summer just to buy an eight-track.

496
00:49:37,488 --> 00:49:41,549
- That sucks.
- No, actually it was great.

497
00:49:43,193 --> 00:49:46,128
All I did was party and get laid.

498
00:49:47,765 --> 00:49:50,825
I had my whole life ahead of me.

499
00:49:52,736 --> 00:49:57,070
My dad thinks I pay for all
this with catering jobs.

500
00:49:57,141 --> 00:50:00,110
Never underestimate
the power of denial.

501
00:50:21,598 --> 00:50:28,127
There must be some way out of here
Said the joker to the thief

502
00:50:29,506 --> 00:50:33,101
There's too much confusion

503
00:50:33,177 --> 00:50:37,273
-  I can't get no relief
- What the hell do you think you're doing?

504
00:50:37,348 --> 00:50:40,215
Uh-oh. Mom's mad.

505
00:50:40,284 --> 00:50:42,343
Bench presses.

506
00:50:42,419 --> 00:50:47,049
I'm going to whale on my pecks,
and then I'm going to do my back.

507
00:50:47,124 --> 00:50:50,992
I see you're smoking pot now.
I... I'm so glad.

508
00:50:51,061 --> 00:50:53,552
I think using illegal psychotropic substances...

509
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:56,121
is a very positive example
to set for our daughter.

510
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:00,466
You're one to talk, you bloodless,
money-grubbing freak.

511
00:51:01,672 --> 00:51:03,697
Uh... Lester!

512
00:51:03,774 --> 00:51:05,799
You have such hostility in you.

513
00:51:05,876 --> 00:51:10,142
Do you mind? I'm trying to work out here.
Unless... you want to spot me.

514
00:51:10,214 --> 00:51:13,809
Lester, you will not get away with this.

515
00:51:13,884 --> 00:51:17,012
- You can be sure of that.
-  There are many here among us

516
00:51:17,087 --> 00:51:20,682
- That's... what...
-  Who feel that life is but a joke

517
00:51:20,758 --> 00:51:22,885
you... think.

518
00:51:23,527 --> 00:51:26,587
"My job consists of basically masking...

519
00:51:26,663 --> 00:51:30,360
"my contempt for the assholes in charge...

520
00:51:30,434 --> 00:51:34,097
"and at least once a day retiring to the men's room...

521
00:51:34,171 --> 00:51:36,332
"so I can jerk off...

522
00:51:36,407 --> 00:51:39,035
"while I fantasize about a life...

523
00:51:39,109 --> 00:51:42,545
that doesn't so closely resemble hell."

524
00:51:42,613 --> 00:51:46,344
Well, you obviously have no interest
in saving yourself.

525
00:51:46,417 --> 00:51:50,615
Brad, for 14 years, I've been a whore
for the advertising industry.

526
00:51:50,687 --> 00:51:54,418
The only way I could save myself now
is if I start firebombing.

527
00:51:54,491 --> 00:51:58,188
Whatever. Management wants you
gone by the end of the day.

528
00:51:58,262 --> 00:52:01,425
Just what sort of severance package
is management prepared to offer me,

529
00:52:01,498 --> 00:52:04,023
considering the information
I have about our editorial director...

530
00:52:04,101 --> 00:52:06,035
buying pussy with company money?

531
00:52:06,103 --> 00:52:08,833
Which I think would interest the I.R.S.,

532
00:52:08,906 --> 00:52:10,965
since it technically constitutes fraud.

533
00:52:11,041 --> 00:52:13,976
And I'm sure that some of our
advertisers and rival publications...

534
00:52:14,044 --> 00:52:18,310
might like to know about it as well,
not to mention... Craig's wife.

535
00:52:20,417 --> 00:52:24,649
- What do you want?
- One year's salary with benefits.

536
00:52:24,721 --> 00:52:27,884
That's not going to happen.

537
00:52:27,958 --> 00:52:31,325
What do you say I throw in a little
sexual harassment charge to boot?

538
00:52:31,395 --> 00:52:35,161
Against who?

539
00:52:35,232 --> 00:52:37,063
Against you.

540
00:52:37,134 --> 00:52:40,661
Can you prove that you didn't
offer to save my job...

541
00:52:40,737 --> 00:52:43,262
if I let you blow me?

542
00:52:48,378 --> 00:52:51,779
Man... you are one twisted fuck.

543
00:52:53,183 --> 00:52:56,414
Nope. I'm just an ordinary guy...

544
00:52:56,487 --> 00:52:59,183
with nothing to lose.

545
00:53:04,161 --> 00:53:06,129
Yeah.

546
00:53:11,635 --> 00:53:14,263
- Carolyn.
- Buddy.

547
00:53:14,338 --> 00:53:18,570
- I am so sorry to have kept you waiting.
- Oh.

548
00:53:18,642 --> 00:53:21,042
Christy left for New York this morning.

549
00:53:21,111 --> 00:53:24,569
Let's just say things were a little...
hectic around the house.

550
00:53:24,648 --> 00:53:28,140
- What's she doing in New York?
- She's moving there.

551
00:53:28,218 --> 00:53:30,243
Yes, we are splitting up.

552
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,914
Buddy. I'm so sorry.

553
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:36,653
Yes. According to her, I'm...

554
00:53:36,727 --> 00:53:38,752
too focused on my career.

555
00:53:38,829 --> 00:53:45,630
As if being driven to succeed is
some sort of a character flaw.

556
00:53:45,702 --> 00:53:49,695
Well, she certainly did take advantage of
the lifestyle my success afforded her.

557
00:53:49,773 --> 00:53:52,264
Ooh! Ha. Wow.

558
00:53:54,111 --> 00:53:57,274
- Ah, it's for the best.
- Mm-hmm.

559
00:53:57,347 --> 00:54:01,841
When I saw you two at the party the other
night, you seemed perfectly happy.

560
00:54:01,919 --> 00:54:04,615
Well, call me crazy,

561
00:54:04,688 --> 00:54:09,182
but it is my philosophy
that in order to be successful,

562
00:54:09,259 --> 00:54:12,023
one must project an image of success...

563
00:54:12,095 --> 00:54:14,188
at all times.

564
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:36,576
What are you doing?

565
00:54:36,653 --> 00:54:40,282
- I was filming this dead bird.
- Why?

566
00:54:40,357 --> 00:54:42,552
Because it's beautiful.

567
00:54:45,062 --> 00:54:48,725
I think maybe you forgot your
medication today, mental boy.

568
00:54:50,701 --> 00:54:52,669
Hi, Jane.

569
00:54:52,736 --> 00:54:55,170
I want you to stop filming me.

570
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:59,074
Okay.

571
00:54:59,142 --> 00:55:01,702
Well, whatever. This is boring.

572
00:55:01,778 --> 00:55:04,508
Let's go.

573
00:55:04,581 --> 00:55:07,982
- Do you need a ride?
- Are you crazy?

574
00:55:08,051 --> 00:55:11,350
I don't want to end up hacked to pieces
in a Dumpster somewhere.

575
00:55:11,421 --> 00:55:14,879
It's okay. L'll walk.
But thanks.

576
00:55:14,958 --> 00:55:17,324
He doesn't want to go anyway.
Let's go.

577
00:55:18,662 --> 00:55:22,359
- Come on, Jane.
- I think I'm going to walk too.

578
00:55:22,432 --> 00:55:24,559
What?

579
00:55:24,635 --> 00:55:28,571
Jane, that's, like, almost a mile.

580
00:55:40,951 --> 00:55:44,648
Oh, God!

581
00:55:44,721 --> 00:55:47,155
I love it! Oh! Oh!

582
00:55:47,224 --> 00:55:50,455
- You like getting nailed by the King?
- Oh, yes, I love it!

583
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:53,360
- Fuck me, Your Majesty! Aah!
- Ohh!

584
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:55,455
- Who's the King?
- Oh! You are!

585
00:56:12,816 --> 00:56:14,977
American woman

586
00:56:15,052 --> 00:56:17,987
Stay away from me

587
00:56:18,055 --> 00:56:20,319
American woman

588
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:22,824
Mama, let me be

589
00:56:24,327 --> 00:56:26,693
Don't come knockin' around my door

590
00:56:26,763 --> 00:56:29,357
I don't wanna see your face no more

591
00:56:29,433 --> 00:56:31,799
I got better things to do

592
00:56:31,868 --> 00:56:34,462
Than spend my life growin' old with you

593
00:56:34,538 --> 00:56:36,472
Now, woman

594
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:38,906
Said stay away

595
00:56:38,975 --> 00:56:41,307
Smile. You're at Mr. Smiley's.

596
00:56:41,378 --> 00:56:43,312
What?

597
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:47,646
Would you like to try our new bacon and egg fajita
for $1.29 for a limited time only?

598
00:56:47,718 --> 00:56:50,653
Uh, no, but thank you.

599
00:56:50,721 --> 00:56:54,748
I'd like the Big Barn Burger,
Smiley Fries and an orange soda.

600
00:56:54,825 --> 00:56:57,293
Please drive up to the window.
Thank you.

601
00:56:59,162 --> 00:57:02,791
Smile. You're at Mr. Smiley's.
That'll be 4.98, please.

602
00:57:02,866 --> 00:57:05,027
Mama, let me be

603
00:57:05,102 --> 00:57:07,366
- Would you like some Smiley sauce?
- No, no...

604
00:57:07,437 --> 00:57:10,133
Actually, I'd like to fill out an application.

605
00:57:10,207 --> 00:57:14,166
- There's no jobs for manager. It's just for counter.
- Good.

606
00:57:14,244 --> 00:57:19,079
I'm looking for the least possible
amount of responsibility.

607
00:57:21,418 --> 00:57:23,716
I don't think you'd fit in here.

608
00:57:23,787 --> 00:57:26,950
I have fast food experience.

609
00:57:27,023 --> 00:57:29,321
Yeah, like 20 years ago.

610
00:57:29,392 --> 00:57:33,294
I'm sure there've been amazing
technological advances in the industry,

611
00:57:33,363 --> 00:57:35,957
but surely you must have
some sort of training program.

612
00:57:36,032 --> 00:57:38,830
It seems unfair to presume
I won't be able to learn.

613
00:57:43,206 --> 00:57:46,471
- That was exactly what I needed...
- Mm.

614
00:57:49,446 --> 00:57:52,506
the "royal treatment," so to speak.

615
00:57:54,885 --> 00:57:58,150
I was so stressed out. Ah!

616
00:57:58,221 --> 00:58:00,883
- Ah! Ah.
- Mm.

617
00:58:04,161 --> 00:58:06,925
Know what I do when I feel like that?

618
00:58:06,997 --> 00:58:09,329
What?

619
00:58:09,399 --> 00:58:12,334
- I fire a gun.
- Really?

620
00:58:12,402 --> 00:58:15,269
Oh, yeah. I go to this
little firing range downtown,

621
00:58:15,338 --> 00:58:19,707
and I... just pop off a few rounds.

622
00:58:19,776 --> 00:58:23,712
- I've never fired a gun before.
- Well, you've gotta try it.

623
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:26,715
Nothing makes you feel more powerful.

624
00:58:28,785 --> 00:58:31,117
Well...

625
00:58:31,188 --> 00:58:33,383
almost nothing.

626
00:58:37,761 --> 00:58:41,253
- So, do you like your new house?
- I like it.

627
00:58:41,331 --> 00:58:44,858
The people who used to live there fed these stray cats,
so they were always around,

628
00:58:44,935 --> 00:58:47,597
and it drove my mother nuts.

629
00:58:47,671 --> 00:58:51,630
And then she cut down their tree.

630
00:58:51,708 --> 00:58:53,801
Is that a funeral?

631
00:58:53,877 --> 00:58:58,211
Yeah. Have you ever known anybody who died?

632
00:58:58,281 --> 00:59:01,216
No. Have you?

633
00:59:01,284 --> 00:59:03,377
No.

634
00:59:03,453 --> 00:59:06,286
But I did see this homeless woman
who froze to death once...

635
00:59:06,356 --> 00:59:08,790
just laying there on the sidewalk.

636
00:59:08,859 --> 00:59:11,123
She looked really sad.

637
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:27,234
I got that homeless woman on videotape.

638
00:59:27,310 --> 00:59:29,403
Why would you film that?

639
00:59:29,479 --> 00:59:33,245
- Because it was amazing.
- What's amazing about it?

640
00:59:33,316 --> 00:59:37,446
When you see something like that,
it's like God is looking right at you,

641
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,511
just for a second,

642
00:59:39,589 --> 00:59:42,456
and if you're careful, you can look right back.

643
00:59:42,525 --> 00:59:45,392
And what do you see?

644
00:59:45,462 --> 00:59:47,430
Beauty.

645
01:00:03,313 --> 01:00:06,407
Mom, I want you to meet somebody.

646
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:13,055
- Mom.
- Yes?

647
01:00:15,292 --> 01:00:19,456
I want you to meet somebody.
This is Jane.

648
01:00:19,529 --> 01:00:21,827
- Hi.
- Oh, my.

649
01:00:21,898 --> 01:00:25,390
I apologize for the way things look around here.

650
01:00:35,412 --> 01:00:37,972
This is where my dad hides out.

651
01:00:38,048 --> 01:00:40,482
I take it he's got a thing for guns.

652
01:00:42,052 --> 01:00:46,011
You gotta see this one thing.

653
01:00:46,089 --> 01:00:49,525
My dad would kill me if he knew I was in here.

654
01:00:49,592 --> 01:00:51,617
Did you steal his keys?

655
01:00:51,695 --> 01:00:54,630
No. One of my clients is a locksmith.

656
01:00:54,698 --> 01:00:58,634
He was short on cash one night,
so I let him pay me in trade.

657
01:01:11,848 --> 01:01:14,009
Turn it over.

658
01:01:17,287 --> 01:01:19,983
Oh, my God.

659
01:01:20,056 --> 01:01:22,490
It's, like, official state china
of the Third Reich.

660
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:26,461
There's a whole subculture of people
who collect this Nazi shit.

661
01:01:26,529 --> 01:01:29,054
But my dad just has this one thing.

662
01:01:41,177 --> 01:01:44,510
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

663
01:01:44,581 --> 01:01:47,550
No, you're scared of me.

664
01:01:48,651 --> 01:01:50,846
No, I'm not.

665
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:55,414
You want to see the most beautiful
thing I've ever filmed?

666
01:02:18,148 --> 01:02:20,582
It was one of those days...

667
01:02:20,650 --> 01:02:23,585
where it's a minute away from snowing,

668
01:02:25,822 --> 01:02:28,757
and there was this electricity in the air.

669
01:02:31,227 --> 01:02:33,821
You can almost hear it.

670
01:02:33,897 --> 01:02:35,990
Right?

671
01:02:39,736 --> 01:02:43,604
And this bag was just...

672
01:02:43,673 --> 01:02:46,437
dancing with me,

673
01:02:48,478 --> 01:02:53,347
like a little kid begging me to play with it,

674
01:02:53,416 --> 01:02:56,010
for 15 minutes.

675
01:02:59,489 --> 01:03:03,585
That's the day I realized
that there was this...

676
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:07,562
entire life behind things...

677
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:14,796
and this incredibly benevolent force...

678
01:03:14,871 --> 01:03:19,171
that wanted me to know that there
was no reason to be afraid...

679
01:03:20,743 --> 01:03:22,938
ever.

680
01:03:25,181 --> 01:03:27,775
Video's a poor excuse, I know,

681
01:03:30,553 --> 01:03:33,044
but it helps me remember.

682
01:03:36,759 --> 01:03:39,159
I need to remember.

683
01:03:46,069 --> 01:03:49,334
Sometimes there's so much...

684
01:03:49,405 --> 01:03:52,272
beauty...

685
01:03:52,342 --> 01:03:54,776
in the world.

686
01:03:56,212 --> 01:03:59,648
I feel like I can't take it...

687
01:04:02,819 --> 01:04:05,686
and my heart...

688
01:04:05,755 --> 01:04:08,315
is just going to...

689
01:04:08,391 --> 01:04:10,689
cave in.

690
01:04:57,207 --> 01:05:00,802
Oh, my God.
What time is it?

691
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:10,412
- Sorry I'm late.
- No, that's quite all right, dear.

692
01:05:10,486 --> 01:05:13,353
Your father and I were just
discussing his day at work.

693
01:05:13,423 --> 01:05:15,857
Why don't you tell our daughter about it, honey?

694
01:05:15,925 --> 01:05:18,985
Janie, today I quit my job.

695
01:05:19,062 --> 01:05:21,997
Then I told my boss to go fuck himself, and then
I blackmailed him for almost $60,000.

696
01:05:22,065 --> 01:05:23,930
- Pass the asparagus.
- Your father seems to think...

697
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,468
this kind of behavior is something to be proud of.

698
01:05:26,536 --> 01:05:29,300
And your mother seems to prefer that I go
through life like a fucking prisoner...

699
01:05:29,372 --> 01:05:31,636
while she keeps my dick in a Mason jar under the sink.

700
01:05:31,708 --> 01:05:34,302
How dare you speak to me that way in front of her?

701
01:05:34,377 --> 01:05:36,971
And I marvel that you can be so contemptuous of me...

702
01:05:37,046 --> 01:05:39,537
on the same day that you lose your job!

703
01:05:39,616 --> 01:05:41,811
I didn't lose it. It's not like,
"Whoops, where did my job go?"

704
01:05:41,884 --> 01:05:43,818
I quit! Pass the asparagus.

705
01:05:43,886 --> 01:05:47,151
Oh, oh, oh! And I want to thank you for
putting me under the added pressure...

706
01:05:47,223 --> 01:05:49,282
of being the sole breadwinner now.

707
01:05:49,359 --> 01:05:51,293
- I already have a job.
- No, no!

708
01:05:51,361 --> 01:05:53,955
Don't give a second thought as to
who's going to pay the mortgage.

709
01:05:54,030 --> 01:05:56,294
We'll leave it up to Carolyn. "You're going to take care
of everything now, Carolyn?"

710
01:05:56,366 --> 01:05:58,129
"Yes. I don't mind."

711
01:05:58,201 --> 01:06:00,829
"Everything? You don't mind having
the sole responsibility?

712
01:06:00,903 --> 01:06:03,497
Your husband feels he can just
quit his job, and you don't..."

713
01:06:03,573 --> 01:06:05,803
Will someone please pass me
the fucking asparagus?

714
01:06:05,875 --> 01:06:08,469
- I'm not going to be a part of this.
- Sit down!

715
01:06:08,544 --> 01:06:12,913
And I'm irresponsibly mad

716
01:06:12,982 --> 01:06:15,849
For you

717
01:06:15,918 --> 01:06:19,012
Go on and call me

718
01:06:19,088 --> 01:06:21,022
Unpredictable

719
01:06:21,090 --> 01:06:25,151
Tell me that I'm impractical

720
01:06:25,228 --> 01:06:28,789
Rainbows I'm inclined to pursue

721
01:06:28,865 --> 01:06:32,198
I am sick and tired of being treated like I don't exist.

722
01:06:32,268 --> 01:06:36,364
You two do whatever you want to do whenever
you want to do it, and I don't complain.

723
01:06:36,439 --> 01:06:39,704
- All I want...
- Oh, you don't complain? Oh, please! Excuse me!

724
01:06:39,776 --> 01:06:42,711
I must be psychotic then!
If you don't complain, what is this?

725
01:06:42,779 --> 01:06:47,148
Yeah, let's bring in the laugh meter and
see how loud it gets on that one.

726
01:06:49,952 --> 01:06:53,945
Mad for you

727
01:06:57,894 --> 01:07:00,158
Don't interrupt me, honey.

728
01:07:14,143 --> 01:07:16,168
And another thing.

729
01:07:16,245 --> 01:07:18,839
From now on, we're going
to alternate our dinner music,

730
01:07:18,915 --> 01:07:21,509
because, frankly...
and I don't think I'm alone here...

731
01:07:21,584 --> 01:07:24,951
I am really tired
of this Lawrence Welk shit.

732
01:07:28,191 --> 01:07:30,785
A bright, shiny world

733
01:07:33,529 --> 01:07:36,225
- Go away.
- Please.

734
01:07:36,299 --> 01:07:38,392
Please let me in.

735
01:07:47,043 --> 01:07:50,103
Look, I wish that you hadn't witnessed
that awful scene tonight,

736
01:07:50,179 --> 01:07:52,113
but in a way, I'm glad.

737
01:07:52,181 --> 01:07:55,810
Why? So I could see what freaks
you and Dad really are?

738
01:07:55,885 --> 01:07:57,978
Me?

739
01:07:59,555 --> 01:08:02,319
Tsk. God.

740
01:08:02,392 --> 01:08:05,020
Oh, Christ. Mom.

741
01:08:05,094 --> 01:08:07,995
No, I'm glad because, uh...

742
01:08:10,233 --> 01:08:15,728
because you're old enough now to learn
the most important lesson in life:

743
01:08:15,805 --> 01:08:19,969
You cannot count on anyone except yourself.

744
01:08:24,814 --> 01:08:27,977
You cannot count on anyone except yourself.

745
01:08:29,419 --> 01:08:32,286
You know, it's sad but true,

746
01:08:32,355 --> 01:08:34,721
and the sooner you learn it, the better.

747
01:08:34,791 --> 01:08:38,727
Look, Mom, I really don't feel like
having a Kodak moment here.

748
01:08:38,795 --> 01:08:41,662
You ungrateful little brat!

749
01:08:41,731 --> 01:08:44,791
Just look at everything you have!

750
01:08:44,867 --> 01:08:47,461
When I was your age, I lived in a duplex!

751
01:08:47,537 --> 01:08:51,496
We didn't even have our own house.

752
01:10:51,093 --> 01:10:53,027
You little bastard!

753
01:10:53,095 --> 01:10:55,029
Dad, no, I just...

754
01:10:55,097 --> 01:10:57,190
How did you get in there?

755
01:10:57,266 --> 01:10:59,131
How? How?

756
01:11:01,070 --> 01:11:03,436
Come on! Get up!
Come on!

757
01:11:03,506 --> 01:11:05,337
Get up!

758
01:11:05,408 --> 01:11:07,433
Fight back, you little pussy!

759
01:11:07,510 --> 01:11:10,206
- No, sir, I won't fight you.
- How?

760
01:11:10,279 --> 01:11:13,271
- How did you get in there?
- I picked the lock, sir.

761
01:11:13,349 --> 01:11:17,012
What were you looking for, huh?
Money? Are you on dope again?

762
01:11:17,086 --> 01:11:20,886
No, sir. I wanted to show my
girlfriend your Nazi plate.

763
01:11:20,957 --> 01:11:22,788
A girlfriend?

764
01:11:22,858 --> 01:11:25,520
Yes, sir. She lives next door.

765
01:11:38,441 --> 01:11:41,103
Her name's Jane.

766
01:12:00,096 --> 01:12:03,031
This is for your own good, boy.

767
01:12:05,334 --> 01:12:10,033
You have no respect for other people's
things and for authority...

768
01:12:10,106 --> 01:12:12,165
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

769
01:12:12,241 --> 01:12:16,405
Can't just go around doing
whatever you feel like.

770
01:12:16,479 --> 01:12:18,913
You can't.
There are rules in life.

771
01:12:18,981 --> 01:12:21,745
Yes, sir.

772
01:12:23,719 --> 01:12:27,120
You need structure, yeah.
You need...

773
01:12:27,189 --> 01:12:30,158
- Discipline.
- Yes, sir. Thank you for trying to teach me.

774
01:12:30,226 --> 01:12:32,524
Don't give up on me, Dad.

775
01:12:37,333 --> 01:12:39,267
Oh, Ricky.

776
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:46,902
You stay out of there.

777
01:13:34,390 --> 01:13:36,654
- Whoo!
- I gotta say, Mrs. Burnham,

778
01:13:36,726 --> 01:13:40,719
when you first came here, I thought you
would be hopeless, but you're a natural.

779
01:13:40,796 --> 01:13:44,323
Well, all I know is I love shooting this gun.

780
01:13:46,235 --> 01:13:49,602
Don't tell me not to fly I've simply got to

781
01:13:49,672 --> 01:13:52,903
If someone takes a spill it's me and not you

782
01:13:52,975 --> 01:13:59,312
Don't bring around the cloud
to rain on my parade

783
01:13:59,381 --> 01:14:02,509
I'm gonna march my band out

784
01:14:02,585 --> 01:14:06,112
l'll beat my drum

785
01:14:06,188 --> 01:14:09,487
And if I'm found out

786
01:14:09,558 --> 01:14:11,856
Your turn at bat, sir

787
01:14:11,927 --> 01:14:14,020
-  Hey
-  At least I didn't fake it

788
01:14:14,096 --> 01:14:17,395
Hat, sir, so what I didn't make it

789
01:14:17,466 --> 01:14:21,903
Nobody

790
01:14:21,971 --> 01:14:27,534
I said nobody

791
01:14:27,610 --> 01:14:30,306
Nobody

792
01:14:30,379 --> 01:14:33,974
Had better rain

793
01:14:34,049 --> 01:14:36,813
On my

794
01:14:36,886 --> 01:14:41,016
Parade

795
01:14:41,090 --> 01:14:43,058
Yeah

796
01:14:57,506 --> 01:14:59,440
What?

797
01:14:59,508 --> 01:15:02,170
Uh, whose car is that out front?

798
01:15:02,244 --> 01:15:04,735
Mine. 1970 Pontiac Firebird,

799
01:15:04,814 --> 01:15:07,681
the car I've always wanted,
and now I have it.

800
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:10,446
- I rule!
- Uh-huh. Where's the Camry?

801
01:15:10,519 --> 01:15:12,612
I traded it in.

802
01:15:12,688 --> 01:15:17,022
- Shouldn't you have consulted me first?
- Hm, let me think.

803
01:15:17,092 --> 01:15:19,322
No. You never drove it.

804
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:24,122
Have you done something different?
You look great.

805
01:15:29,271 --> 01:15:31,205
Where's Jane?

806
01:15:31,273 --> 01:15:33,468
Jane not home.

807
01:15:40,015 --> 01:15:41,949
We have...

808
01:15:44,553 --> 01:15:47,613
the whole house...

809
01:15:47,690 --> 01:15:50,250
to ourselves.

810
01:15:52,428 --> 01:15:55,261
Christ, Carolyn.

811
01:15:55,331 --> 01:15:57,765
When did you become so...

812
01:15:59,401 --> 01:16:02,461
joyless?

813
01:16:02,538 --> 01:16:05,132
Joyless?

814
01:16:05,207 --> 01:16:07,767
I am not joyless.

815
01:16:07,843 --> 01:16:10,437
There happens to be a lot about me...

816
01:16:10,512 --> 01:16:14,448
that you don't know, Mr. Smarty Man.

817
01:16:14,516 --> 01:16:17,849
There's plenty of joy in my life.

818
01:16:20,256 --> 01:16:22,747
Whatever happened to that girl...

819
01:16:25,794 --> 01:16:31,528
who used to fake seizures at frat
parties when she got bored?

820
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:36,469
Who used to run up to the roof
of our first apartment building...

821
01:16:36,538 --> 01:16:39,302
to flash the traffic helicopters?

822
01:16:39,375 --> 01:16:44,074
Have you totally forgotten about her?

823
01:16:44,146 --> 01:16:46,307
Because I haven't.

824
01:16:59,395 --> 01:17:02,660
Lester, you're going to spill beer on the couch.

825
01:17:09,738 --> 01:17:11,672
So what?
It's just a couch.

826
01:17:13,976 --> 01:17:16,308
This is a $4,000 sofa,

827
01:17:16,378 --> 01:17:18,312
upholstered in Italian silk.

828
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:20,473
This is not just a couch.

829
01:17:20,549 --> 01:17:24,315
It's just... a... couch!

830
01:17:24,386 --> 01:17:26,581
This isn't life!

831
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:28,850
This is just stuff,

832
01:17:28,924 --> 01:17:31,518
and it's become more important
to you than living.

833
01:17:31,593 --> 01:17:33,788
Well, honey, that's just nuts.

834
01:17:42,838 --> 01:17:45,363
I'm only trying to help you!

835
01:17:50,479 --> 01:17:53,277
Don't.

836
01:17:53,349 --> 01:17:55,442
Why?

837
01:17:58,220 --> 01:18:00,711
It's weird watching myself.

838
01:18:00,789 --> 01:18:03,223
I don't like how I look.

839
01:18:05,794 --> 01:18:08,729
I can't believe you don't know
how beautiful you are.

840
01:18:08,797 --> 01:18:12,790
Look. I'm not going
to sit here for that shit.

841
01:18:21,210 --> 01:18:24,179
Ha! How does it feel now?

842
01:18:24,246 --> 01:18:26,214
Fine.

843
01:18:26,281 --> 01:18:28,272
You don't feel naked?

844
01:18:29,651 --> 01:18:31,915
I am naked.

845
01:18:31,987 --> 01:18:34,421
You know what I mean.

846
01:18:43,499 --> 01:18:46,593
So tell me about being in the hospital.

847
01:18:49,605 --> 01:18:53,598
When I was 15, my dad caught me smoking dope.

848
01:18:53,675 --> 01:18:58,874
He totally freaked and decided
to send me to military school.

849
01:18:58,947 --> 01:19:02,439
I told you this whole thing about
structure and discipline, right?

850
01:19:02,518 --> 01:19:06,113
Of course, I got kicked out.

851
01:19:06,188 --> 01:19:08,622
Dad and I had this huge fight.

852
01:19:08,690 --> 01:19:11,818
He hit me.

853
01:19:11,894 --> 01:19:15,853
And the next day at school,
some kid made a crack about my haircut,

854
01:19:17,666 --> 01:19:19,759
and I just snapped.

855
01:19:23,439 --> 01:19:26,840
I wanted to kill him.

856
01:19:26,909 --> 01:19:29,275
I would've... killed him...

857
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:33,874
if they hadn't pulled me off.

858
01:19:36,985 --> 01:19:41,012
That's when my dad put me in the hospital.

859
01:19:41,090 --> 01:19:44,924
They drugged me up and left me
in there for two years.

860
01:19:46,395 --> 01:19:48,727
Wow.

861
01:19:48,797 --> 01:19:51,857
You must really hate him.

862
01:19:51,934 --> 01:19:54,630
No.

863
01:19:54,703 --> 01:19:56,864
He's not a bad man.

864
01:19:56,939 --> 01:20:01,569
Well, you'd better believe I'd hate my dad
if he did something like that to me.

865
01:20:01,643 --> 01:20:03,474
Wait.

866
01:20:03,545 --> 01:20:05,809
I already do hate my dad.

867
01:20:07,683 --> 01:20:09,776
Why?

868
01:20:11,787 --> 01:20:15,382
He's a total asshole;
he's got this crush on my friend Angela,

869
01:20:15,457 --> 01:20:17,687
and it's disgusting.

870
01:20:17,759 --> 01:20:21,320
You'd rather he had the crush on you.

871
01:20:21,396 --> 01:20:23,660
Gross. No.

872
01:20:27,069 --> 01:20:31,563
But it'd be nice if I was anywhere near
as important to him as she is.

873
01:20:34,643 --> 01:20:39,580
I know you think my dad's harmless,
but you're wrong.

874
01:20:39,648 --> 01:20:42,913
He's doing massive psychological damage to me.

875
01:20:42,985 --> 01:20:45,180
How?

876
01:20:45,254 --> 01:20:48,781
Well, now I, too, need structure,

877
01:20:48,857 --> 01:20:52,020
a little fucking discipline.

878
01:21:02,604 --> 01:21:05,266
I'm serious, though.

879
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:08,275
How could he not be damaging me?

880
01:21:10,212 --> 01:21:13,147
I need a father who's a role model,

881
01:21:13,215 --> 01:21:15,809
not some horny geek boy who's
going to spray his shorts...

882
01:21:15,884 --> 01:21:20,617
whenever I bring a girlfriend
home from school.

883
01:21:20,689 --> 01:21:22,953
What a lame-o.

884
01:21:25,394 --> 01:21:28,591
Someone really should just...
put him out of his misery.

885
01:21:32,034 --> 01:21:34,730
Want me to kill him for you?

886
01:21:43,412 --> 01:21:45,607
Yeah. Would you?

887
01:21:47,349 --> 01:21:49,317
It'll cost you.

888
01:21:49,384 --> 01:21:52,080
I've been baby-sitting since I was about ten.

889
01:21:52,154 --> 01:21:54,679
I've got almost $3,000.

890
01:21:57,259 --> 01:22:00,023
Of course I was saving it up for a boob job.

891
01:22:01,530 --> 01:22:03,691
But...

892
01:22:17,212 --> 01:22:20,648
You know, that's not a very nice thing to do...

893
01:22:23,018 --> 01:22:25,452
hiring someone to kill your dad.

894
01:22:28,190 --> 01:22:32,854
Well, I guess I'm not a very nice girl then, am I?

895
01:22:55,350 --> 01:22:58,046
You know I'm not serious, right?

896
01:22:59,121 --> 01:23:01,146
Of course.

897
01:23:15,804 --> 01:23:19,672
You know how lucky we are
to have found each other?

898
01:23:23,979 --> 01:23:26,447
Remember those posters that said...

899
01:23:26,515 --> 01:23:30,918
"Today is the first day of the rest of your life"?

900
01:23:30,986 --> 01:23:35,582
Well, that's true with every day except one...

901
01:23:35,657 --> 01:23:37,887
the day you die.

902
01:23:37,959 --> 01:23:40,792
I've looked under chairs

903
01:23:40,862 --> 01:23:43,262
I've looked under tables

904
01:23:43,332 --> 01:23:47,928
I've tried to find the key to 50 million fables

905
01:23:48,003 --> 01:23:50,198
They call me the Seeker

906
01:23:52,441 --> 01:23:56,969
I've been searching low and high

907
01:23:59,514 --> 01:24:03,075
I won't get to get what I'm after

908
01:24:03,151 --> 01:24:05,142
Till the day I die

909
01:24:11,259 --> 01:24:15,821
I asked Bobby Dylan I asked the Beatles

910
01:24:16,932 --> 01:24:18,729
Jane, hurry up.

911
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:21,894
I've got a very important appointment.

912
01:24:21,970 --> 01:24:26,134
- Is it okay if Angela sleeps over tonight?
- She's always welcome.

913
01:24:26,208 --> 01:24:30,577
I thought you two had a fight. I haven't
seen her around here in a while.

914
01:24:37,552 --> 01:24:39,520
What?

915
01:24:39,588 --> 01:24:42,682
I've been too embarrassed to bring her over,

916
01:24:42,758 --> 01:24:45,352
because of you and that way that you behave.

917
01:24:45,427 --> 01:24:48,794
- What are you talking about? I've barely even spoken to her.
- Dad!

918
01:24:48,864 --> 01:24:52,231
You stare at her all the time like you're drunk!

919
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:54,564
- It's disgusting!
- You better watch yourself,

920
01:24:54,636 --> 01:24:59,300
or you're going to turn into a real
bitch just like your mother!

921
01:25:01,543 --> 01:25:03,477
Oh, fuck.

922
01:25:11,386 --> 01:25:13,877
You ready to go?

923
01:25:13,955 --> 01:25:16,150
Oh, I-I don't need a ride.

924
01:25:16,224 --> 01:25:18,658
I'm going with Jane and her mom.

925
01:25:25,634 --> 01:25:27,568
Oh, morning!

926
01:25:27,636 --> 01:25:29,627
Yo, Ricky!

927
01:25:29,704 --> 01:25:32,639
- How's it going?
- Pretty decent, Mr. Burnham.

928
01:25:32,707 --> 01:25:34,800
Hey. Wait.

929
01:26:53,421 --> 01:26:56,356
I need that Super Smiley
with cheese ASAP!

930
01:26:56,424 --> 01:26:59,291
- You need more than that, my little hombre.
- May I take your order?

931
01:26:59,361 --> 01:27:02,387
- Oh, yeah! What's good here?
- Nothing.

932
01:27:02,464 --> 01:27:05,490
Oh, well, then I guess we'll just
have to be bad, won't we?

933
01:27:05,567 --> 01:27:08,934
l'll have a Double Smiley sandwich,

934
01:27:09,004 --> 01:27:11,495
- Curly fries and a vanilla shake.
- Make that two.

935
01:27:11,573 --> 01:27:15,441
That'll be 7.98. Please drive up
to the window. Thank you.

936
01:27:15,510 --> 01:27:19,947
I think we deserve a little junk food after
the workout we had this morning.

937
01:27:21,950 --> 01:27:25,442
- Did you know that?
- Thank you. I'm flattered.

938
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:28,148
Smile! You're at Mr. Smiley's!

939
01:27:29,758 --> 01:27:32,852
Would you like to try our new beef
and cheese pot pie on a stick?

940
01:27:32,928 --> 01:27:35,419
Just $1.99 for a limited time only.

941
01:27:35,497 --> 01:27:40,457
- We were just at a seminar. Buddy, this is my...
- Her husband.

942
01:27:40,535 --> 01:27:42,969
We've met before, but something tells me...

943
01:27:43,038 --> 01:27:45,438
you're going to remember me this time.

944
01:27:45,507 --> 01:27:47,532
Whoa!

945
01:27:47,609 --> 01:27:50,635
You are so busted.

946
01:27:50,712 --> 01:27:52,771
This really doesn't concern you.

947
01:27:52,847 --> 01:27:57,546
Well, actually, Janine is senior drive-thru manager,
so you are on her turf.

948
01:27:59,854 --> 01:28:04,382
So, this makes sense.

949
01:28:04,459 --> 01:28:06,950
- Oh, Lester...
- Honey, it's okay.

950
01:28:07,028 --> 01:28:10,794
I want you to be happy.
Would you like Smiley Sauce with that?

951
01:28:10,865 --> 01:28:12,799
- Lester, just stop it!
- No, no.

952
01:28:12,867 --> 01:28:14,960
You...

953
01:28:15,036 --> 01:28:18,130
don't get to tell me what to do...

954
01:28:18,206 --> 01:28:20,572
ever again.

955
01:28:34,522 --> 01:28:36,513
I'm sorry.

956
01:28:37,959 --> 01:28:40,894
I guess we should cool it for a while.

957
01:28:42,964 --> 01:28:46,127
I'm facing a potentially very expensive divorce.

958
01:28:46,201 --> 01:28:49,102
No, no, I understand completely.

959
01:28:49,170 --> 01:28:51,536
It's...

960
01:28:51,606 --> 01:28:56,805
"In order to be successful, one must project
an image of success at all times."

961
01:29:23,138 --> 01:29:25,402
Stop it. Stop it.

962
01:29:39,921 --> 01:29:42,014
Oh, oh, whoa

963
01:29:48,163 --> 01:29:52,532
There she stood in the street

964
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:55,569
Smiling from her head
to her feet

965
01:29:55,637 --> 01:29:58,936
I said Hey, what is this

966
01:29:59,007 --> 01:30:01,134
Now, baby, maybe

967
01:30:01,209 --> 01:30:04,042
Maybe she's in need of a kiss

968
01:30:04,112 --> 01:30:07,411
-  I said, Hey, what's your name
- Shit.

969
01:30:14,355 --> 01:30:16,448
I have to run next door.

970
01:30:16,524 --> 01:30:20,620
Jane left her geometry book in my bag,
and she needs it to do her homework.

971
01:30:29,370 --> 01:30:34,137
So you and psycho boy are fucking on,
like, a regular basis now, right?

972
01:30:34,209 --> 01:30:36,234
No.

973
01:30:36,311 --> 01:30:39,371
Come on. You can tell me.
Does he have a big dick?

974
01:30:39,447 --> 01:30:43,884
I'm not going to talk about his dick
with you, okay? It's not like that.

975
01:30:43,952 --> 01:30:47,319
Not like what?
Doesn't he have one?

976
01:30:47,388 --> 01:30:49,652
Why don't you want to talk about it?

977
01:30:49,724 --> 01:30:53,125
- I tell you every detail about every guy that I fuck.
- Yeah.

978
01:30:53,194 --> 01:30:58,029
Maybe you shouldn't, all right? Maybe I really
don't want to hear about all that.

979
01:30:58,099 --> 01:31:01,830
So now that you have a boyfriend,
you're, like, above it?

980
01:31:01,903 --> 01:31:05,896
We got to get you a real man.

981
01:31:25,860 --> 01:31:29,455
- You got any papers?
- Yeah, in the cigar box right over there.

982
01:31:29,531 --> 01:31:33,092
Put up a fight, dude. You are such a
pushover. "No, I can't, really. Okay."

983
01:31:33,168 --> 01:31:35,432
You should learn to roll a joint.

984
01:32:39,601 --> 01:32:41,762
Oh! Hi.

985
01:32:41,836 --> 01:32:44,862
- Where's Mom?
- Don't know.

986
01:32:44,939 --> 01:32:48,204
- Hi, Mr. Burnham.
- Hi.

987
01:32:48,276 --> 01:32:52,679
Wow, look at you.
Have you been working out?

988
01:32:52,747 --> 01:32:55,443
Some.

989
01:32:58,987 --> 01:33:01,251
You can really tell.

990
01:33:03,691 --> 01:33:05,784
Look at those arms.

991
01:33:10,231 --> 01:33:12,461
You like... muscles?

992
01:33:14,035 --> 01:33:18,938
I should probably go see what Jane's up to.

993
01:33:30,084 --> 01:33:32,348
Where did you get that?

994
01:33:34,289 --> 01:33:37,383
- From my job.
- Don't lie to me.

995
01:33:40,028 --> 01:33:42,997
Now, I saw you with him.

996
01:33:43,064 --> 01:33:45,464
You were watching me?

997
01:33:46,634 --> 01:33:48,932
What does he make you do?

998
01:33:49,003 --> 01:33:51,471
Oh.

999
01:33:51,539 --> 01:33:54,303
Dad, you don't really think
me and Mr. Burnham...

1000
01:33:54,375 --> 01:33:57,606
Don't you laugh at me!

1001
01:33:57,679 --> 01:34:02,582
I will not sit back and watch my only
son become a cocksucker!

1002
01:34:02,650 --> 01:34:04,584
Jesus, what is it with you?

1003
01:34:07,355 --> 01:34:09,687
I swear to God...

1004
01:34:09,757 --> 01:34:12,487
l'll throw you out of this house
and never look at you again!

1005
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:16,587
- You mean that.
- You're damn straight I do!

1006
01:34:16,664 --> 01:34:20,600
I'd rather you were dead
than be a fuckin' faggot!

1007
01:34:31,779 --> 01:34:34,043
You're right.

1008
01:34:37,352 --> 01:34:40,344
- I suck dick for money.
- Boy, don't start.

1009
01:34:40,421 --> 01:34:44,323
- Two thousand dollars. I'm that good.
- Get out!

1010
01:34:44,392 --> 01:34:48,852
You should see me fuck. I'm the best
piece of ass in three states.

1011
01:34:48,930 --> 01:34:52,696
Damn it, get out!
I don't ever want to see you again.

1012
01:34:58,639 --> 01:35:02,632
What a sad...
old man you are.

1013
01:35:03,878 --> 01:35:05,812
Get out.

1014
01:35:31,706 --> 01:35:35,369
Mom... I'm leaving.

1015
01:35:35,443 --> 01:35:37,604
Okay.

1016
01:35:40,281 --> 01:35:42,249
Wear a raincoat.

1017
01:35:49,357 --> 01:35:52,292
I wish things would have
been better for you.

1018
01:35:56,297 --> 01:35:58,265
Take care of Dad.

1019
01:36:30,231 --> 01:36:32,791
disinvesting problems of power...

1020
01:36:32,867 --> 01:36:35,700
and removing their ability
to make us afraid.

1021
01:36:35,770 --> 01:36:39,137
This is the secret to "Me-Centered Living."

1022
01:36:39,207 --> 01:36:41,937
Only by taking full responsibility...

1023
01:36:42,009 --> 01:36:44,375
for your actions and their solutions...

1024
01:36:44,445 --> 01:36:48,438
will you ever break free from
the constant cycle of victimhood.

1025
01:36:48,516 --> 01:36:53,954
You are only a victim if you choose
to be a victim. We all have the power...

1026
01:36:54,021 --> 01:36:56,649
I don't think we can be friends anymore!

1027
01:36:56,724 --> 01:36:58,658
You're too uptight about sex.

1028
01:36:58,726 --> 01:37:02,059
Just don't fuck my dad, all right?

1029
01:37:02,130 --> 01:37:04,257
- Please?
- Why not?

1030
01:37:04,332 --> 01:37:07,768
Dad, leave us alone!

1031
01:37:07,835 --> 01:37:10,326
It's me.

1032
01:37:10,404 --> 01:37:13,703
- If I had to leave tonight, would you come with me?
- What?

1033
01:37:13,774 --> 01:37:17,335
If I had to go to New York to live,
tonight, would you come with me?

1034
01:37:19,046 --> 01:37:21,071
Yes.

1035
01:37:21,149 --> 01:37:25,609
You guys can't be serious. You're just
a kid, and he's, like, a mental case.

1036
01:37:25,686 --> 01:37:29,645
- You'll end up living in a box on the street.
- I'm no more a kid than you are.

1037
01:37:29,724 --> 01:37:32,921
- We can use my plastic surgery money.
- We won't have to.

1038
01:37:32,994 --> 01:37:36,725
I have over $40,000. I know people
in the city that can help us get set up.

1039
01:37:36,797 --> 01:37:39,960
- What, other drug dealers?
- Yes.

1040
01:37:40,034 --> 01:37:43,060
- You'd be out of your mind to go with him.
- Why do you even care?

1041
01:37:43,137 --> 01:37:46,163
- Because you're my friend.
- She's not your friend.

1042
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:48,504
She's someone you use
to feel better about yourself.

1043
01:37:48,576 --> 01:37:51,977
- Go fuck yourself, psycho!
- Hey, shut up, bitch!

1044
01:37:52,046 --> 01:37:55,140
- Jane, he's a freak!
- Well, then so am I!

1045
01:37:55,216 --> 01:37:58,583
We'll always be freaks,
and we'll never be like other people!

1046
01:37:58,653 --> 01:38:02,384
And you'll never be a freak
'cause you're just... too perfect!

1047
01:38:02,456 --> 01:38:06,722
Yeah, well, at least I'm not ugly.

1048
01:38:08,563 --> 01:38:10,724
Yes, you are.

1049
01:38:10,798 --> 01:38:14,325
And you're boring, and you're totally ordinary,

1050
01:38:14,402 --> 01:38:16,996
and you know it.

1051
01:38:19,373 --> 01:38:21,534
You two deserve each other.

1052
01:39:22,236 --> 01:39:24,670
Jesus, man, you're soaked.

1053
01:39:35,249 --> 01:39:39,151
You want me to get Ricky?
He's in Jane's room.

1054
01:39:40,488 --> 01:39:42,649
Are you okay?

1055
01:39:42,723 --> 01:39:44,657
Where's your wife?

1056
01:39:46,227 --> 01:39:48,320
Uh, I don't know.

1057
01:39:48,396 --> 01:39:52,355
Probably out fucking that dorky
Prince of Real Estate asshole.

1058
01:39:53,701 --> 01:39:56,261
And you know what?

1059
01:39:56,337 --> 01:39:58,305
I don't care.

1060
01:40:08,683 --> 01:40:11,618
Your wife is with another man, and...

1061
01:40:11,686 --> 01:40:13,779
you don't care?

1062
01:40:16,023 --> 01:40:18,457
Nope.

1063
01:40:18,526 --> 01:40:21,324
Our marriage is just for show.

1064
01:40:21,395 --> 01:40:24,558
A commercial for how normal we are...

1065
01:40:24,632 --> 01:40:26,827
when we're anything but.

1066
01:40:34,475 --> 01:40:36,670
Jesus, man, you are shaking.

1067
01:40:36,744 --> 01:40:40,578
We really ought to get you
out of these clothes.

1068
01:40:40,648 --> 01:40:43,515
Yeah.

1069
01:40:43,584 --> 01:40:46,644
It's okay.

1070
01:40:49,056 --> 01:40:52,355
I... am...

1071
01:40:52,426 --> 01:40:55,418
You just tell me what you need.

1072
01:40:58,632 --> 01:41:01,157
It's okay.

1073
01:41:16,517 --> 01:41:18,781
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1074
01:41:22,356 --> 01:41:24,824
I'm sorry.

1075
01:41:24,892 --> 01:41:27,383
Y-You got the wrong idea.

1076
01:42:04,331 --> 01:42:06,822
"I refuse to be a victim."

1077
01:42:06,901 --> 01:42:09,165
When this becomes your mantra,

1078
01:42:09,236 --> 01:42:12,205
constantly reinforcing your new non...

1079
01:42:14,909 --> 01:42:18,345
I refuse to be a victim!

1080
01:42:51,178 --> 01:42:54,170
Old man lying by the side of the road

1081
01:42:54,248 --> 01:42:58,150
With the lorries rolling by

1082
01:42:58,219 --> 01:43:02,019
Blue moon sinking from the weight of the load

1083
01:43:02,089 --> 01:43:05,354
I hope you don't mind if I play the stereo.

1084
01:43:05,426 --> 01:43:07,690
Not at all.

1085
01:43:07,761 --> 01:43:10,423
Bad night?

1086
01:43:10,498 --> 01:43:13,592
Not really bad, just...

1087
01:43:13,667 --> 01:43:15,692
strange.

1088
01:43:15,769 --> 01:43:20,502
Believe me, it couldn't possibly be
any stranger than mine.

1089
01:43:20,574 --> 01:43:24,203
It's only castles burning

1090
01:43:24,278 --> 01:43:27,543
Find someone who's turning

1091
01:43:27,615 --> 01:43:31,551
-  And you will come around
- Jane and I had a fight.

1092
01:43:31,619 --> 01:43:33,712
It was about you.

1093
01:43:36,357 --> 01:43:39,520
She's mad at me because...

1094
01:43:39,593 --> 01:43:41,857
I said I think you're sexy.

1095
01:43:43,964 --> 01:43:46,057
Do you want a sip?

1096
01:43:46,133 --> 01:43:48,693
Sure.

1097
01:43:50,371 --> 01:43:53,067
"Come on down to the river of sight

1098
01:43:53,140 --> 01:43:57,304
And you can really understand"

1099
01:43:57,378 --> 01:44:00,211
Red lights flashing through
the window in the rain

1100
01:44:00,281 --> 01:44:03,978
Can you hear the sirens moan

1101
01:44:04,051 --> 01:44:07,214
White cane lying in the gutter in the lane

1102
01:44:07,288 --> 01:44:10,052
And you're walking home alone

1103
01:44:10,124 --> 01:44:12,991
Don't let it bring you down

1104
01:44:13,060 --> 01:44:16,325
It's only castles burning

1105
01:44:16,397 --> 01:44:19,924
- Find someone who's turning
- So.

1106
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:23,197
- And you will come around
- You gonna tell me?

1107
01:44:26,674 --> 01:44:29,199
What do you want?

1108
01:44:32,179 --> 01:44:35,945
- I don't know.
-  Don't let it bring you down

1109
01:44:36,016 --> 01:44:40,544
- You... don't know?
-  It's only castles burning

1110
01:44:40,621 --> 01:44:44,113
- What do you want?
-  Find someone who's turning

1111
01:44:44,191 --> 01:44:47,183
- Are you kidding?
- And you will come around

1112
01:44:47,261 --> 01:44:50,458
I want you.

1113
01:44:53,133 --> 01:44:56,864
I've wanted you since
the first moment I saw you.

1114
01:44:59,273 --> 01:45:02,834
You are the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen.

1115
01:45:02,910 --> 01:45:06,971
And the buildings scrape the sky

1116
01:45:07,047 --> 01:45:10,380
Cold wind ripping down the valley at dawn

1117
01:45:10,451 --> 01:45:13,818
- You don't think I'm ordinary?
- And the morning paper flies

1118
01:45:13,887 --> 01:45:15,582
Dead man lying

1119
01:45:15,656 --> 01:45:19,592
- You couldn't be ordinary if you tried.
- By the side of the road

1120
01:45:19,660 --> 01:45:21,924
Don't let it bring you down

1121
01:45:21,996 --> 01:45:24,760
- Thank you.
-  It's only castles burning

1122
01:45:24,832 --> 01:45:29,462
- I don't think there's anything worse than being ordinary.
-  Find someone who's turning

1123
01:45:29,536 --> 01:45:32,027
And you will come around

1124
01:45:32,106 --> 01:45:34,438
Don't let it bring you down

1125
01:45:34,508 --> 01:45:36,635
Don't let it bring you down

1126
01:45:36,710 --> 01:45:39,508
And you will come around

1127
01:45:39,580 --> 01:45:42,140
Don't let it bring you down

1128
01:45:42,216 --> 01:45:45,117
Don't let it bring you down

1129
01:45:46,954 --> 01:45:49,445
I refuse to be a victim.

1130
01:45:49,523 --> 01:45:52,959
I refuse to be a victim.
I refuse to be a victim.

1131
01:45:53,027 --> 01:45:55,120
Lester,

1132
01:45:55,195 --> 01:45:57,993
I have something
I have to say to you.

1133
01:46:46,947 --> 01:46:50,212
Are you scared?

1134
01:46:50,284 --> 01:46:52,718
I don't get scared.

1135
01:46:55,355 --> 01:46:58,119
My parents will try to find me.

1136
01:46:58,192 --> 01:47:01,218
Mine won't.

1137
01:47:21,448 --> 01:47:24,417
This is my first time.

1138
01:47:26,920 --> 01:47:29,081
You're kidding.

1139
01:47:29,156 --> 01:47:31,147
I'm sorry.

1140
01:47:31,225 --> 01:47:33,853
I still want to do it.

1141
01:47:33,927 --> 01:47:37,260
I just... thought I should tell you...

1142
01:47:37,331 --> 01:47:39,526
in case you wondered why I...

1143
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:42,433
I wasn't... better.

1144
01:47:55,616 --> 01:47:57,880
What's wrong?

1145
01:48:03,924 --> 01:48:07,724
I thought you said I was beautiful.

1146
01:48:07,795 --> 01:48:09,820
You are beautiful.

1147
01:48:12,566 --> 01:48:16,161
You are so... beautiful.

1148
01:48:19,540 --> 01:48:22,008
And I would be a very...

1149
01:48:22,075 --> 01:48:24,043
lucky man.

1150
01:48:25,379 --> 01:48:28,007
I feel so stupid.

1151
01:48:28,081 --> 01:48:30,572
Don't.

1152
01:48:30,651 --> 01:48:33,711
- Shh.
- I'm sorry.

1153
01:48:33,787 --> 01:48:37,814
You have nothing to be sorry about.

1154
01:48:37,891 --> 01:48:40,792
It's okay.

1155
01:48:40,861 --> 01:48:44,160
Everything's okay.

1156
01:48:59,213 --> 01:49:02,011
Wow, I was starving.

1157
01:49:02,082 --> 01:49:06,576
- Do you want me to make you another one?
- No, no, no. I'm fine.

1158
01:49:06,653 --> 01:49:09,019
You sure?

1159
01:49:09,089 --> 01:49:14,083
I'm still a little weirded out, but I feel better. Thanks.

1160
01:49:17,531 --> 01:49:21,262
- How's Jane?
- What do you mean?

1161
01:49:22,736 --> 01:49:25,227
I mean,

1162
01:49:25,305 --> 01:49:27,671
how's her life?

1163
01:49:27,741 --> 01:49:29,902
Is she happy?

1164
01:49:29,977 --> 01:49:33,140
Is she miserable?

1165
01:49:33,213 --> 01:49:37,775
I'd really like to know, and she'd die
before she'd ever tell me about it.

1166
01:49:40,087 --> 01:49:43,352
She's, uh...

1167
01:49:43,423 --> 01:49:46,483
She's really happy.

1168
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:50,087
She thinks she's in love.

1169
01:50:00,841 --> 01:50:04,140
Good for her.

1170
01:50:05,946 --> 01:50:07,880
How are you?

1171
01:50:15,856 --> 01:50:19,292
It's been a long time since anybody asked me that.

1172
01:50:25,732 --> 01:50:28,428
I'm great.

1173
01:50:34,141 --> 01:50:37,133
I've gotta go to the bathroom.

1174
01:50:49,923 --> 01:50:52,255
I'm great.

1175
01:51:26,526 --> 01:51:29,620
Man, oh man.

1176
01:51:31,498 --> 01:51:34,331
Man, oh man, oh man.

1177
01:52:09,603 --> 01:52:12,037
Oh, my God.

1178
01:52:53,980 --> 01:52:56,073
Wow.

1179
01:52:57,684 --> 01:53:00,448
I had always heard your entire life flashes...

1180
01:53:00,520 --> 01:53:04,422
in front of your eyes the second before you die.

1181
01:53:04,491 --> 01:53:07,255
First of all, that one second...

1182
01:53:07,327 --> 01:53:10,091
isn't a second at all.

1183
01:53:10,163 --> 01:53:12,256
It stretches on forever,

1184
01:53:12,332 --> 01:53:15,165
like an ocean of time.

1185
01:53:17,104 --> 01:53:20,130
For me, it was lying on my back...

1186
01:53:20,207 --> 01:53:24,075
at Boy Scout camp,
watching falling stars.

1187
01:53:32,452 --> 01:53:35,717
And yellow leaves from the maple trees...

1188
01:53:35,789 --> 01:53:38,223
that lined our street.

1189
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:50,299
Or my grandmother's hands
and the way her skin...

1190
01:53:50,370 --> 01:53:52,702
seemed like paper.

1191
01:53:59,946 --> 01:54:03,712
And the first time I saw my cousin Tony's...

1192
01:54:03,783 --> 01:54:06,752
brand-new Firebird.

1193
01:54:18,465 --> 01:54:20,558
And Janie.

1194
01:54:21,968 --> 01:54:23,902
And Janie.

1195
01:54:55,869 --> 01:54:58,235
And... Carolyn.

1196
01:55:03,276 --> 01:55:07,042
I guess I could be pretty pissed off
about what happened to me,

1197
01:55:07,113 --> 01:55:12,608
but it's hard to stay mad when
there's so much beauty in the world.

1198
01:55:12,686 --> 01:55:17,851
Sometimes I feel like I'm seeing
it all at once and it's too much.

1199
01:55:17,924 --> 01:55:23,021
My heart fills up like a balloon
that's about to burst.

1200
01:55:23,096 --> 01:55:27,192
And then I remember
to relax...

1201
01:55:27,267 --> 01:55:30,361
and stop trying
to hold on to it.

1202
01:55:30,437 --> 01:55:34,032
And then it flows
through me like rain,

1203
01:55:34,107 --> 01:55:37,804
and I can't feel anything
but gratitude...

1204
01:55:37,877 --> 01:55:40,038
for every single moment...

1205
01:55:40,113 --> 01:55:44,049
of my stupid little life.

1206
01:55:44,117 --> 01:55:47,553
You have no idea what
I'm talking about, I'm sure.

1207
01:55:47,621 --> 01:55:49,612
But don't worry.

1208
01:55:50,724 --> 01:55:53,056
You will someday.

1209
01:55:57,964 --> 01:56:02,162
Ahhh, ahh

1210
01:56:03,303 --> 01:56:08,002
Because the world is round

1211
01:56:08,074 --> 01:56:14,070
It turns me on

1212
01:56:15,548 --> 01:56:18,483
Because

1213
01:56:18,551 --> 01:56:21,247
The world

1214
01:56:21,321 --> 01:56:26,190
Is round

1215
01:56:28,061 --> 01:56:31,087
Ahhh

1216
01:56:31,164 --> 01:56:33,257
Ahh

1217
01:56:33,333 --> 01:56:38,032
Because the wind is high

1218
01:56:38,104 --> 01:56:43,940
It blows my mind

1219
01:56:45,612 --> 01:56:48,445
Because

1220
01:56:48,515 --> 01:56:51,040
The wind

1221
01:56:51,117 --> 01:56:55,884
Is high

1222
01:56:57,857 --> 01:57:01,623
Ahhh, ahh

1223
01:57:01,695 --> 01:57:04,630
Love is old, Love is new

1224
01:57:07,600 --> 01:57:10,467
Love is all, Love is you

1225
01:57:15,141 --> 01:57:19,805
Because the sky is blue

1226
01:57:19,879 --> 01:57:25,784
It makes me cry

1227
01:57:27,220 --> 01:57:30,155
Because

1228
01:57:30,223 --> 01:57:32,851
The sky

1229
01:57:32,926 --> 01:57:37,625
Is blue

1230
01:57:39,499 --> 01:57:42,366
Ahhh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh

1231
01:57:42,435 --> 01:57:44,596
Ahhh, ahh, ahh

1232
01:57:44,671 --> 01:57:46,764
Ah, ah, ah

1233
01:57:51,244 --> 01:57:53,940
Ahhh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh

1234
01:57:54,013 --> 01:57:56,914
Ahh, ah, ah, ah

1235
01:57:56,983 --> 01:57:58,917
Ahhh

1236
01:58:02,789 --> 01:58:06,748
Ahhh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh

1237
01:58:08,661 --> 01:58:11,459
Ahhh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh

1238
01:58:11,531 --> 01:58:13,499
Ahhh
