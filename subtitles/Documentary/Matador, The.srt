1
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:56,289
It's 73 degrees
on this beautiful morning.

2
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,258
It's 6:59 in the a.m.

3
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:00,593
Enjoy Mr. Sunshine while you can, friends,

4
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:03,863
because AccuWeather is predicting
thunderstorms tomorrow.

5
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:07,592
So it's time to wake up and enjoy the day.

6
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:09,235
Wake up.

7
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:10,971
Wake up, Julian.

8
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,806
Julian?

9
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,374
Julian?

10
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:15,575
Julian.

11
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,244
Oh..

12
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:20,880
The freeway is tied up
around Lincoln,

13
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:24,150
but 685 is looking jim-dandy
in both directions.

14
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,152
More traffic reports on the five,

15
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,288
but coming up,
beautiful Kimberly..

16
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:30,190
with complete AccuWeather..

17
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:37,128
Oh.

18
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:00,585
Oh.

19
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,915
Hey, mister, is that your car?

20
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,839
What?

21
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,675
The cool Porsche.
You keep staring at it.

22
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,243
Why don't you shoo?

23
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:39,045
I don't want to shoo.

24
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:41,481
Your mother tell you
never to talk to strangers?

25
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:44,284
She's over there,
and she says I should talk to you.

26
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:46,944
- She did?
- Yeah.

27
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,255
She wants to know what you're doing here.

28
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,990
I think she thinks you're cute.

29
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,161
I don't know anything about that car.

30
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:57,263
And I'm only interested in your mother..

31
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:59,199
if she lost 20 pounds and 30 years,

32
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,035
so I'd really like it
if you got the fuck away from me.

33
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,804
- Whatever.
- Yeah, whatever. Goodbye. Scadoodle.

34
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:10,769
- See ya, wouldn't want to be ya.
- Smell ya, shouldn't have to tell ya.

35
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,121
Hi.

36
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,525
Bean.

37
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:33,726
You're up early.

38
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:35,826
Thunder woke me up.

39
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:39,960
I wanted to see you before you left.

40
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,498
- I'm gonna miss that.
- Me too.

41
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:45,713
I'm gonna miss everything.

42
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,106
It's only two nights.

43
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:49,375
With this weather and our luck,

44
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:50,543
it scares me.

45
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:53,612
Honey, you know I gotta go.

46
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:56,649
But I'm coming home to you in two days.

47
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,469
With really good news,
I promise.

48
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:05,458
Mmm.

49
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:06,859
- Oh.
- Ooh.

50
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,661
Oh.

51
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,129
Danny.

52
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:11,831
Are you sure you have time?

53
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,133
Maybe not for dinner and a movie, but..

54
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:15,735
Oh.

55
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,835
Danny.

56
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:19,839
Oh.

57
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:25,278
Tree.

58
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:51,902
Still horny?

59
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,891
Flight 421
to Salt Lake City has been delayed..

60
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,991
Danny. Danny.

61
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,060
Oh.

62
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:18,698
I'm so sorry, Phil.

63
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,767
No, it's fine.
Is Bean all right?

64
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:23,236
Oh, yeah, the Fire Department's
over there.

65
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,481
Our crazy neighbors,
the tyrannists..

66
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,940
She's fine, really.

67
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,209
She practically forced me
to get over here.

68
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:32,211
She knows what this job means, right?

69
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,847
She knows somebody
has to pay for a new kitchen.

70
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:37,517
Now be better just make this flight, huh?

71
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:39,185
Yeah, we will.

72
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:40,720
I mean, we have to.

73
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,880
Hope the weather's better in Mexico.

74
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:07,436
Mr. Noble,
how are you today?

75
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:09,513
Couldn't be better.

76
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,949
But, more importantly,

77
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,311
how are you..

78
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,387
Genevive?

79
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:19,516
Buenas tardes.

80
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:23,250
Deme una margarita, por favor.

81
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:25,322
Con mucha sal.

82
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:06,109
Cerveza, por favor.

83
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:33,223
Gracias.

84
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:40,931
My business is my pleasure.

85
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:09,128
How ya doin'?

86
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,230
I'm a..
I'm a nervous wreck.

87
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,798
Think positive.

88
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:16,468
I think that I'm sweating through my suit.

89
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:04,481
Hello, Julian.

90
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:07,353
Getting some culture?

91
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,654
Indeed.

92
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:12,520
Isn't she a tad pubescent?
Even for you?

93
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:15,141
I'd make an exception for her.

94
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:18,597
- Did you study the assignment?
- No, I shredded it.

95
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:22,568
Then I humped the bellboy
on the room service cart.

96
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:26,297
- Am I supposed to be shocked?
- Adios.

97
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:28,708
Que tenga buena día.

98
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,310
I hate these Catholic countries.

99
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:35,369
All blushy-blushy. No sucky-fucky.

100
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:39,952
Well, somehow I think
you'll find your way.

101
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:43,089
Now, look, there's been a change of plans.

102
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:46,959
The portfolio has to be delivered
sooner than we discussed.

103
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:48,227
What are you saying?

104
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,329
She's leaving for Europe tomorrow.

105
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:51,931
I'm not a fucking magician.

106
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:54,031
Just get it done today.

107
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,743
I almost forgot.

108
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,111
Yeah?

109
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:08,339
Happy birthday.

110
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:19,114
Happy birthday?

111
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,191
Fuck.

112
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,214
Incredible.

113
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,751
What can I say, the guy..

114
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:49,155
We shouldn't
even need to think about it.

115
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:50,689
That's good, right?

116
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:52,191
Yes, I think so.

117
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,501
Dos margaritas, por favor.

118
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:55,561
Oh.

119
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,463
You know, I think we did it.

120
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,865
I don't know what
you were freaking out about.

121
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:02,001
- You were remarkable.
- No, you were.

122
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:04,160
No, you. It was you.

123
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,938
No way they can't give us this job.

124
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:07,206
You really think that?

125
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:09,306
I know.

126
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,843
- Good.
- Uh.

127
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,144
- Ah.
- Yeah.

128
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,712
Shh. We need two more.

129
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,031
Hello?

130
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,233
- Andy.
- Yeah?

131
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:11,237
Andy, you crazy limey bastard, it's me.

132
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:12,705
Who?

133
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,340
- Julian.
- Who?

134
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,108
J..Julian Noble from Portugal.

135
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,043
- Remember?
- Who?

136
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,143
Julian Noble.

137
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:22,781
Yeah. I just thought I'd give you a chat.

138
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:25,217
See how you're doing.
It's my birthday.

139
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,787
Andy? Hello?

140
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:42,527
Yeah, hello.
Is Cindy there?

141
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,943
Fuck it.

142
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:11,344
Now, this smells like a party.

143
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:28,614
Margarita, por favor.

144
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,714
Sí, señor.

145
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:36,115
Well, you look like you could use one.

146
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,794
Hm.

147
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,062
Who couldn't?

148
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:45,528
I've had, uh..

149
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:49,192
Four, five, maybe. I don't know..

150
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:51,293
They're darn tasty.

151
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,806
Margaritas always taste better in Mexico.

152
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,240
They certainly do.

153
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,340
Margaritas and cock.

154
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:03,916
Gracias. And one for my friend over there.

155
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:06,485
- Oh, no, no. That's..
- Don't worry.

156
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,488
- I'm not trying to make a pass at you.
- I'm not worried.

157
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,290
If you're that type of guy..

158
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,792
- I don't mean to be rude but..
- It's all right.

159
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:16,017
I'm just messin' with ya.

160
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:28,538
I'm sorry about the cock comment.

161
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,242
Kind of a conversation stopper.

162
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:33,743
Kinda.

163
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,415
Yeah.

164
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:40,212
So? What are you doing in Mexico?

165
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:48,155
Tell me something, uh..

166
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:50,991
Dan. Danny.
Danny Wright.

167
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:53,063
Garrison & Wright.

168
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:57,964
Tell me something,
Danny Wright.

169
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:00,036
Yes, sir.

170
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,609
Why the hell do you care
why I'm in Mexico?

171
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,465
- Why so interested, huh?
- No reason. Just..

172
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,450
hotel bar conversation, I guess.

173
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,052
Are you with the farm?

174
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,313
- What's that?
- The agency?

175
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:17,556
- What?
- Are you following me?

176
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,525
- No, no.
- Did I make you?

177
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,493
I have no idea what you're talk..

178
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:24,153
Did I fucking make you? Hm?

179
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:27,027
OK. I'm going to excuse myself.

180
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:30,169
- I have to go, thank you.
- No. No, please.

181
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:32,294
No, I'm really tired.

182
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:34,940
No, no, please.
I didn't mean to weird you out.

183
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:39,290
I just get paranoid sometimes.
I was wrong. Please.

184
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,704
I'm drunk. I'm tired.

185
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:45,117
I've been fornicating
for the last two hours,

186
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,286
and, before that,
I was doing shit..

187
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:49,581
Horrible business shit..

188
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:50,923
Please.. come on.

189
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,391
I was out of order.

190
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,426
Let's finish our drink.
Come on.

191
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,694
Here you go.

192
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:57,996
Here you are.
Here's your drink.

193
00:19:58,096 --> 00:19:59,531
Danny?
Here you go.

194
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:02,167
I mean, you seem like a nice guy.

195
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:04,701
You know, a normal guy.

196
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,470
I'm sorry.

197
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,842
Really, it's all right.

198
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:14,444
So..

199
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:16,615
you in town on business?

200
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:17,683
Hm?

201
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:20,758
You have that way about you, Danny.

202
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:29,661
Why are you so interested?

203
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,231
It's.. it's..

204
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:35,868
- Very good.
- Yeah?

205
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:37,769
Ah, very good.

206
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:39,771
Oh, I'm here on business.

207
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:41,006
Is it going well?

208
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:42,474
Very well, I hope.

209
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,344
My.. my partner and I..
He's upstairs.

210
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:49,175
We just had a very good pitch session.

211
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,415
No shit?

212
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:51,884
Very good.

213
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:54,214
Well, that's fantastic.

214
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:55,754
That's great, Danny.

215
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:57,122
I needed a day like this.

216
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:58,257
I hear ya.

217
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:01,292
I've had a tough couple years.

218
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,397
I was with this business
out of Denver for nine years.

219
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:08,217
And out of the blue they just..

220
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:11,703
- They laid me off.
- Oh..

221
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:13,438
Yeah. Just like that.

222
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:16,175
And it was, I don't know,
two and a half years ago.

223
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,745
- I've been struggling back ever since.
- And today you got back.

224
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:21,938
Well, I hope.

225
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:25,916
Today you're a man again.

226
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:28,587
Yeah.

227
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:32,316
And to be a man,
after they fuck you..

228
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:35,519
and destroy your self-respect..

229
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:39,142
Well, that is a great thing.

230
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,965
Thank you.

231
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:45,378
Dos margaritas, por favor.

232
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,841
Are you married, Danny?

233
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:52,603
Oh, yeah, I am.
Fourteen years.

234
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:56,014
Oh.. let me guess.
High school sweetheart.

235
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:57,849
It's true.

236
00:21:57,949 --> 00:21:59,785
Unbelievable.

237
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:02,321
The fuckin' American dream, huh?

238
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:04,189
Yeah. What about you?

239
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:06,669
What do you do for a living?

240
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,162
Any kids?

241
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:12,321
You got kids, Danny?

242
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:15,734
Oh, no.
I crossed the line.

243
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,269
No, no, no. You did not.

244
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:19,238
- I did.
- You did not cross the line.

245
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,739
- It's fine.
- I'm sorry.

246
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,839
It's fine.

247
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:32,468
We lost our son three years ago.

248
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:39,353
It was a school bus accident.

249
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:43,428
Fourteen children lived that day..

250
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,528
and one died.

251
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:51,434
That was Henry.

252
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,706
We, uh..

253
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:58,443
had a bad run for a while.

254
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:01,671
Two Mexicans walk into a cantina.

255
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:04,016
What?

256
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:05,851
Two Mexicans walk into a cantina.

257
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:09,087
One's a midget, and the other's got
a dick 15 inches long.

258
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:11,314
W..what are you saying?

259
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,893
I'm trying to change the subject.
The midget says to the bartender,

260
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:17,329
'They call my amigo
the human swizzle stick.

261
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,809
You know what they call me?'

262
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:21,767
This is incredible.

263
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:23,867
What?

264
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:26,905
You're.. very rude.

265
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:28,774
I'm trying to change the subject.

266
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:31,243
Thank you very much for the drink.

267
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:33,893
Goodbye. Good night.
Thank you.

268
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:38,155
Don't you wanna hear the punchline?

269
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:45,411
It's a fucking good one.

270
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:51,227
Gracias.

271
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:51,990
You sure you don't want to switch?

272
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,860
No, no, get outta here.
You're the one with the kids.

273
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,595
You're the one with the tree.

274
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:59,731
You wanna flip another coin?
Somebody's gotta stay for now.

275
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:02,834
- I'll call you the minute I hear.
- Call me sooner.

276
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:04,369
- Oh, God.
- What?

277
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:07,038
My cell phone.
I think I left it at the front desk.

278
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:10,876
- Watch my stuff for a sec?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

279
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:12,878
- Staying a few days?
- What?

280
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:15,180
I couldn't help but overhear.

281
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,581
Yeah. So you're spying..

282
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:19,050
on my personal conversations
now, huh? Great.

283
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:22,821
Something about the asshole buyers
not being completely convinced.

284
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:24,990
And now wanted to hear other pitches?

285
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,158
Pfff.

286
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:28,258
Sorry about that.

287
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:32,330
I..I knew things
were too good to be true anyway.

288
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:35,967
I'm sorry about the circumstances,
but I'm glad you're still in town.

289
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:39,404
It gives me the opportunity to tell you
how truly embarrassed I am..

290
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:43,406
about last night.
See? See, the thing is..

291
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:46,878
I liked you.

292
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:49,915
I kind of enjoyed
talking to someone, you know,

293
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,783
just.. talking.

294
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,883
- Really?
- Yeah.

295
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:58,248
And yet..

296
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,326
I tell you about my dead son,

297
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:03,426
and you mock it.

298
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:08,966
I lost my wife.

299
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:13,398
I was 24 years old,
I was drunk,

300
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:15,807
I plowed our car into an oak tree.

301
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,907
Jesus.

302
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:23,212
Since then, I've soiled
my way through life,

303
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:26,001
been a magnificently cold moron.

304
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:29,221
I run away from anything
that resembles an emotion.

305
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:31,656
Thus, you tell me about your dead son,

306
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:35,326
I tell you a joke about a 15-inch schlong.

307
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,297
So you can forgive me, huh?

308
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:40,832
Got it.

309
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:44,102
Better I remember it now
than somewhere over Amarillo.

310
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:45,370
Right.

311
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,372
All right.
Speak to you mañana, right?

312
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:48,640
Yeah, yeah.

313
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,545
- It's gonna be all right.
- I know.

314
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,718
Danny?
Hey, Danny.

315
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:01,818
Wait. Hey.

316
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,856
I've got an extra ticket to
the bullfights this afternoon.

317
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:06,691
Supposed to be a good one.

318
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,761
It would mean a great deal
to me if you would join me.

319
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:11,861
Oh, I'm so..
Thank you.

320
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:14,432
Thank you very much.
That's very nice of you,

321
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:16,532
and I.. I can't.

322
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:18,036
I can't. I have work.

323
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:20,627
On a Sunday afternoon?

324
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:22,705
Ever seen a bullfight?

325
00:27:23,274 --> 00:27:24,709
No.

326
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:30,504
You haven't seen the real Mexico City
until you've seen a bullfight.

327
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:33,416
Come on.

328
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,730
Olé.

329
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,830
Olé.

330
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,832
Olé.

331
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,834
Olé.

332
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,694
Olé. Olé.

333
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:21,666
Bean is not gonna believe this.

334
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:23,335
I can't wait to tell her.

335
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:26,538
Where did you
ever find a woman like that?

336
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:28,607
A woman you can share everything with.

337
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,342
She's pretty special.

338
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:31,576
You must be too.

339
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:35,246
- I could learn from you.
- Learn what?

340
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:37,716
You want my mortgage,
my blood pressure?

341
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:39,985
I've never had my blood pressure taken,

342
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:42,153
and I wouldn't know how
to get a mortgage..

343
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:44,255
for all the teenage twat in Thailand.

344
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:45,790
You don't own a house?

345
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:46,858
No house.

346
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:49,722
No apartment, no address.

347
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:55,012
- You bullshittin' me?
- I shit you not. Montecristo?

348
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,801
Uh.. yeah.

349
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,169
Thanks.

350
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:01,072
You don't have a permanent address?
Where do you live?

351
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:04,643
- I live wherever I'm working.
- So, what do you do, Julian?

352
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:10,608
What do you possibly do you don't have
a permanent home or an address?

353
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,084
I'd rather not say.

354
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,289
Oh my God, did you see that?

355
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:20,857
Jeez, it's so bloody.

356
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:23,161
We're lucky.
That matador was very good.

357
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,330
It's much worse when they're mediocre.

358
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,430
- Why?
- A great matador,

359
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:30,168
he can kill the bull with
one plunge of the blade.

360
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,103
A lesser one,
he's going to have to..

361
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:33,905
plunge that blade more than once.

362
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:36,474
That makes the crowd very unhappy.

363
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:38,677
They don't like to see the bull suffer.

364
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:39,811
No.

365
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:44,871
No, no. They clearly care
so very much about these animals.

366
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,584
They respect these beasts.

367
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:49,120
They want 'em to die with honor.

368
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,790
That's ridiculous.
There's no honor in being killed..

369
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:54,325
by a man with a sword
whether it's one plunge or 20.

370
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:55,827
Ah, you're wrong.

371
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:57,228
You're very wrong.

372
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:58,897
There is honor.

373
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:00,997
How would you know?

374
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,700
I do.

375
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:09,340
You're a mysterious man, Julian.

376
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,675
Mm..hm.

377
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:20,253
- You won't tell me what you do?
- It's.. confidential.

378
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:21,853
Confidential?

379
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:24,089
What, do you work for the government?

380
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:26,191
The government?
Pfff. Please.

381
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:27,726
You know what they pay?

382
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,989
Hmph. Forget it.
Watch the picadors.

383
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:34,766
- You a spy? Something like that?
- You read too many novels, Danny.

384
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:37,027
Huh? You a spy?

385
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:39,101
Huh?

386
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:45,176
So now you're not going to tell me.
It's OK.

387
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:47,078
It's OK.

388
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,178
All right.

389
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:51,881
Hm. All right.

390
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:55,353
If I tell you,
will you keep your cool?

391
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:57,355
- What do you mean?
- We're in public,

392
00:30:57,455 --> 00:31:00,391
and I don't want you to lose your shit.

393
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:02,891
Lose my shit?

394
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:05,630
My God, w..what are you gonna tell me?

395
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:08,164
Sometimes..

396
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,739
Sometimes what?

397
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:17,171
Sometimes..

398
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:19,962
people need to be eliminated.

399
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:24,847
Oh, come on.

400
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:29,420
What? You're..

401
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,089
- You're a hit man?
- Oh, please.

402
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:34,317
Please. My handler..

403
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,494
calls me a facilitator.

404
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:39,085
A facilitator of fatalities.

405
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:40,799
That's insane.

406
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,233
Think what you like.

407
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:44,035
I gotta hand it to ya, Julian,

408
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:47,739
you're one of the best bullshit artists
I've met, and I've met some.

409
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:50,942
You're absolutely right, Danny.
My name is Earl Johnson.

410
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:54,272
I sell aluminum siding in Minneapolis.

411
00:31:56,581 --> 00:32:00,218
- You actually kill people for a living?
- I do what I'm asked to do.

412
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:01,786
What makes sense to me.

413
00:32:01,886 --> 00:32:03,721
For like, the Mob?

414
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:06,491
I tend to be hired on the more kind of..

415
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,253
anonymous high-paying jobs.

416
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:11,327
Corporate gigs.

417
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,764
Corporate gigs?

418
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:18,421
I'm a great helper in
getting deals closed.

419
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,709
I don't believe you.
I don't believe you.

420
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:28,446
- I don't believe in the Easter Bunny.
- I don't believe you.

421
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:30,481
Come on. Corporate gigs.

422
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:32,417
- Think what you will.
- Ridiculous.

423
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:33,952
- Yes.
- Corporate gigs.

424
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:36,452
Yes. My God..

425
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:39,824
I knew there was a reason
I never told anyone what I did.

426
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:41,559
Uh..huh.

427
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:43,561
All right, see that guy over there?

428
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:45,530
- Fat man and little girl?
- Yeah.

429
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,332
Say I wanted him dead.

430
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:50,201
I want him dead, his family dead.
Dead. Right now.

431
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,503
- Right here.
- Right now? Couldn't happen.

432
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:54,572
I know, but say that it could.

433
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:56,140
- Money's no object.
- OK.

434
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,107
- You sure you wanna know?
- Yeah.

435
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:00,812
- Yeah, you sure?
- Yeah.

436
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:03,292
I want you to facilitate it.

437
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:06,017
OK, Danny.

438
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:07,552
All right, come with me.

439
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,652
- Huh?
- Let's go.

440
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:13,655
Olé.

441
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:16,091
Olé.

442
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,425
Olé.

443
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,497
Olé.

444
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,137
I'm a big fan of the gotta-pee theory
of assassinations.

445
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:28,006
Gotta pee?

446
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:29,607
Everyone's gotta pee.

447
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:31,109
Ah.

448
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:32,810
Now..

449
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,779
ask me for a cigarette.

450
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:37,404
- What?
- Do it.

451
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:39,384
Can I have a cigarette, please?

452
00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:43,904
Sure. But these things'll
kill ya, you know.

453
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,856
Now, look around.

454
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:51,529
They're scary.

455
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:53,464
- Yes and no.
- Why?

456
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:56,334
They seem more interested
in the beautiful women..

457
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:58,469
coming and going from the ladies' room.

458
00:33:58,569 --> 00:33:59,737
That's good for us.

459
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:02,774
Just like those men over there
at the concession stand.

460
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,475
They're only interested in us..

461
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:07,312
if they see us walking over
with our wallets open.

462
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:09,847
No one is watching the men's room.

463
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:11,382
The gotta-pee theory.

464
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:12,650
You're catching on.

465
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,877
Now, escape routes.

466
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:17,455
- Escape routes?
- Don't wanna get caught, right?

467
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,957
Don't get caught, it sucks.

468
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,391
- See the main exit?
- Yeah.

469
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:21,759
That's a traffic jam.

470
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:24,521
- Where else?
- You tell me.

471
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:25,697
OK, OK.

472
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:27,598
Uh, that door over there.

473
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:29,300
If it.. if it weren't locked.

474
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,503
Vietnamese girl I once knew
had her legs so locked together

475
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:34,706
I couldn't get a whiff of her spring roll.

476
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:38,843
Two drinks, half a Quaalude later,
I was at an all-you-can eat buffet.

477
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:40,745
Every lock can be broken.

478
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:45,265
It's just a matter of will
and whether it's worth it.

479
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:49,313
This looks like it's worth it.

480
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:51,289
Uno cigarillos, por favor.

481
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:54,324
Why are we buying the cigarettes?

482
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:56,260
'Cause I wanna smoke.

483
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,395
Gracias.

484
00:34:57,495 --> 00:34:59,656
Come over here.

485
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:02,460
Now do your shoelaces up.

486
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:11,594
What time's our flight
to Florida, Seymour?

487
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:14,473
I think 2:00, Derrick.

488
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,943
Let's go, Seymour.

489
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:47,745
Holy shit.

490
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:33,491
- You ready?
- Ready for what?

491
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:35,326
You wanted to see what I do, right?

492
00:36:35,426 --> 00:36:37,621
Yes.

493
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,363
Yes, I've been watching.

494
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:42,433
- But, you know..
- What? Show-and-tell is over.

495
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,769
The real deal is about to start.

496
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,869
- The real deal?
- Mm..hm.

497
00:36:49,073 --> 00:36:50,808
Show-and-tell is for sissies.

498
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:52,908
But a sissy I'm not.

499
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:56,612
- Come on.
- My God, fire.

500
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:59,016
- Come on. It's a distraction.
- Are you crazy?

501
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:02,587
Fire or tits, either one will
distract most cops.

502
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:04,789
Are you ready to finish what we started?

503
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,625
That was extremely dangerous.
You proved your point.

504
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:08,960
Baloney. Baloney.

505
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,429
The cops may have gone towards the fire,

506
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:14,732
- but his bodyguard probably stood firm.
- Bodyguard?

507
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:17,034
If I'm asked to kill,
they have a bodyguard.

508
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:18,970
If they didn't, they'd ask you.

509
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,439
So I slit the guard's throat in one move,

510
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:23,674
push him into the bathroom..

511
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:26,664
And now we're set up for the kill.

512
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:32,950
Where the hell did you get the knife?

513
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:35,386
He's not peeing,
so it must be number dos.

514
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:37,822
OK, joke's over.
Point made, Julian.

515
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,472
- Not yet. Not yet.
- Point made.

516
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:42,727
The point's made.
Let's get out of here..

517
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:46,397
Don't fuckin' ruin things,
OK? Don't do it.

518
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:54,272
OK. Julian?

519
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:56,574
I'm asking you to stop this.

520
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:58,176
No way, job's not done.

521
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,477
But this is not a job.

522
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:02,042
You said money was no object.

523
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:06,751
- This is want you wanted?
- No.

524
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:08,619
- You helped me.
- I didn't help you.

525
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:09,954
Oh, yes, you did.

526
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:12,604
- Oh, yes, you did.
- No. No, no.

527
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:17,092
Oh, God, no.

528
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:21,365
Oh. Disculpa me, por favor.

529
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,465
Lo siento.

530
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:28,072
Fun, huh?

531
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:33,167
Come on..

532
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:36,147
Whoo..hoo.
That was incredible.

533
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:39,116
- You scared the hell out of me.
- You liked that. You did?

534
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:41,953
- I really bought it.
- What, that I'd stab a stranger?

535
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:43,654
I don't know.

536
00:38:43,754 --> 00:38:46,490
Just like that?
A complete stranger?

537
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,192
Well, yes.
Yes, I did.

538
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:50,161
- I'm not psychotic.
- No, I know.

539
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:53,731
- Psychopathic, not psychotic.
- I don't think you're a psychopath.

540
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:56,968
Well, I kill people. Doesn't that
seem a wee bit psychopathic?

541
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:58,536
Well, yeah, but..

542
00:38:58,636 --> 00:39:00,738
- Don't get the wrong impression.
- Huh?

543
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:03,641
Because we share a laugh
doesn't mean I'm not unsavory.

544
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:06,437
No, what you do is unsavory.

545
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:10,165
You know what they say.
You are what you do.

546
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:27,265
Gracias.

547
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,365
Gracias.

548
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,529
Tell me..

549
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:38,309
will Bean stay with you if
this job doesn't come through?

550
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:40,511
- What?
- Will Bean stay with you..

551
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:43,881
if you continue this losing streak
without any end?

552
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:46,117
If she ever left me I'd fall apart..

553
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:49,084
You're not answering my question.

554
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:53,746
To be quite honest..

555
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:58,863
I don't know how much faith
the woman has left in her.

556
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:01,431
Hey.

557
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:03,499
Hey.

558
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:06,635
Comforting me?

559
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:11,363
- Hey.
- Let's change the subject. Please.

560
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:13,044
- I agree.
- Something sunnier.

561
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:15,144
Sunnier.

562
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:17,148
Absolutely.

563
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,483
There's something I wanted to talk about.

564
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,385
- It's a favor, really.
- Sure.

565
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:23,421
It's big, if that's OK.
A big favor.

566
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:24,622
No, it's OK.

567
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:27,282
See, the thing is..

568
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:29,160
I could use your help.

569
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,995
Help in what?

570
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,663
I'm down here,

571
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:35,766
I finished my other job early,
so I let it be known.

572
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:37,301
You let it be known?

573
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:40,805
Yeah, to the powers that be,
that I was available.

574
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:43,135
- The powers that be?
- Yeah.

575
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:46,444
Anyway, they called me up.
An urgent thing. Has to happen today.

576
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:48,944
An..another job?

577
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:50,247
Mm..hm.

578
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:51,916
Jesus Christ.

579
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:55,816
The thing is, I could
really use your help.

580
00:40:58,355 --> 00:41:00,355
Oh.

581
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:02,927
You're kidding right now.

582
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:05,796
I'm as serious as an erection problem.

583
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:07,921
- I mean, I..
- Gracias.

584
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:10,523
I can't help you, Julian.

585
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:11,969
You could.

586
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:13,704
Well, I could, but I..I can't,

587
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,840
I'm not gonna help kill an innocent man.

588
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,309
- Who says he's innocent?
- This is ridiculous.

589
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:19,610
- Just assisting.
- No.

590
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,679
- You'd just have to..
- No, no, no, no.

591
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:24,482
I'm not listening.
I can't hear you. I can't hear you.

592
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:26,283
- Bup..
- You're being childish.

593
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:28,252
Ooga-shacka, ooga-shacka..

594
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:29,987
- Not listening.
- Childish.

595
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:32,556
You're being childish.
All I'm asking you..

596
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:35,159
- Ta, ta, ta, ta, ta.
- All right. All right.

597
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:37,259
I won't tell you.

598
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:38,729
- Good.
- Won't mention it.

599
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,197
- Great.
- I won't say that..

600
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:42,233
all you have to do
is trip on the street.

601
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:45,503
- I can't believe you just said that.
- Just trip in half an hour..

602
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:49,768
- so his bodyguards look the other way.
- No way.

603
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:53,177
Fifty thousand dollars
is what I could pay you.

604
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:54,845
- No.
- A lot of money. Cash.

605
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:57,982
- It could be interesting and fun.
- I said no.

606
00:41:58,082 --> 00:41:59,750
He's a prick, a real prick.

607
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,119
I don't give a darn who
he is or what he did..

608
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:03,554
or anything like that.

609
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:07,158
I'm not gonna help you, Julian.
I'm not gonna do that.

610
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:11,338
And if you bring it up again,
I'll.. I'll leave.

611
00:42:17,134 --> 00:42:18,469
- Fine.
- Fine.

612
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:21,714
- Change the subject.
- Good. You do it.

613
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:24,706
- Change it.
- You.

614
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:27,075
- Fine.
- OK.

615
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:32,756
When I was a kid,
I wanted to be a cheerleader.

616
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:37,484
Really. A cheerleader.

617
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:42,655
Yeah. I wanted to be thrown in the air
and march in the band.

618
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,895
Seriously?

619
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:46,995
Mm..hm.

620
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:48,933
That's so funny.

621
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:52,069
I've got a brother-in-law
who was a male cheerleader..

622
00:42:52,169 --> 00:42:54,538
Jesus Christ, Danny.
I'm fucking kidding.

623
00:42:54,638 --> 00:42:56,640
I don't want to talk about cheerleaders..

624
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,276
unless I talk about getting in
a shower with them.

625
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:02,713
I want to talk about what I wanted to,
which you don't want to.

626
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:05,363
There's nothing to talk about.

627
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:10,654
Well, then,
it was nice knowing you.

628
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,984
Oh, come..
Now, Julian..

629
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:15,125
Come on, what are you..
You're leaving?

630
00:43:15,225 --> 00:43:17,228
I've got business to attend to.

631
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:19,296
- I really thought..
- Nothing.

632
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:25,069
Think nothing. Just consider me the best
cocktail party story you ever met.

633
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:27,169
Bye, Danny.

634
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,441
Julian.

635
00:43:40,517 --> 00:43:42,753
So unfortunately, I was right.

636
00:43:42,853 --> 00:43:44,989
I finally got in touch with Alejandra..

637
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:46,490
and she said her bosses are..

638
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:48,893
leaning towards Cardenas and his group,

639
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:50,394
and not us.

640
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:53,130
Now, things still might
break in our favor.

641
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:55,633
I mean, their first instinct
was to go with us,

642
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:57,735
but they're getting intense pressure..

643
00:43:57,835 --> 00:43:59,904
to sign with a Mexican company.

644
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:02,006
I'm trying to get Antonio
so I can set up..

645
00:44:02,106 --> 00:44:04,308
one more meeting
with you guys tomorrow.

646
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:06,310
I'll call you when I hear something.

647
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:09,179
So hang in there.
It's not over yet.

648
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:37,455
Danny.

649
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:40,435
Danny, it's Julian.

650
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,012
Come on, Danny,

651
00:44:42,112 --> 00:44:44,214
I just want to say I'm sorry.

652
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:46,850
I know it's late,
and I'm a little fucked up.

653
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:49,612
But.. I'm sorry.

654
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:53,885
I'm a mess. I'm a fucker. Ha.

655
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:02,363
Look, I shouldn't
have asked you to help me.

656
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:05,436
I infringed..
I infringed on your kindness,

657
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:06,704
but please..

658
00:45:06,804 --> 00:45:09,568
let me tell you I'm sorry.

659
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,835
Let me apologize.

660
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:15,003
Can't you see how guilty I feel?

661
00:45:16,513 --> 00:45:18,015
Danny.

662
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:20,140
Danny.

663
00:45:29,991 --> 00:45:32,789
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, yes.

664
00:46:59,881 --> 00:47:01,881
Hello, Julian.

665
00:47:03,084 --> 00:47:05,609
Getting some culture?

666
00:47:06,621 --> 00:47:08,390
Anytime I can.

667
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:10,490
You look tired.

668
00:47:10,825 --> 00:47:12,825
I am.

669
00:47:12,994 --> 00:47:16,164
- I need a break.
- What are you saying, Julian?

670
00:47:16,264 --> 00:47:19,134
Moscow, Las Vegas,
Vienna, the Philippines.

671
00:47:19,234 --> 00:47:21,503
Now Budapest. I'm exhausted.

672
00:47:21,603 --> 00:47:23,204
Well, you know what it's like.

673
00:47:23,304 --> 00:47:26,408
You take a break,
we go with a younger, cheaper kid.

674
00:47:26,508 --> 00:47:28,043
- Oh.
- He does all right.

675
00:47:28,143 --> 00:47:31,646
Maybe we don't want you back when
you're ready to get back in the game.

676
00:47:31,746 --> 00:47:33,181
You'll always want me.

677
00:47:33,281 --> 00:47:35,281
No, not always.

678
00:47:35,283 --> 00:47:37,852
Not if we can save a few dollars.

679
00:47:37,952 --> 00:47:41,189
Not if it gets sloppy again,
like in Manila.

680
00:47:41,289 --> 00:47:42,657
That was one time.

681
00:47:42,757 --> 00:47:44,359
Made some people nervous.

682
00:47:44,459 --> 00:47:45,694
It made me nervous.

683
00:47:45,794 --> 00:47:47,529
Well, that's why I need a break.

684
00:47:47,629 --> 00:47:49,564
I don't want to have that happen again.

685
00:47:49,664 --> 00:47:52,367
- It can't.
- I know, that's what I'm saying.

686
00:47:52,467 --> 00:47:55,370
But I'm feeling burnt-out,
I'm feeling..

687
00:47:55,470 --> 00:47:57,470
shaky.

688
00:47:57,972 --> 00:47:59,708
Can you believe this shit?

689
00:47:59,808 --> 00:48:03,178
I mean, can you believe
the words coming out of my mouth?

690
00:48:03,278 --> 00:48:05,780
Did you ever think
you'd live to see the day?

691
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,016
I never thought you'd live to see the day.

692
00:48:08,116 --> 00:48:10,919
There's not a retirement home
for assassins, is there?

693
00:48:11,019 --> 00:48:13,254
Archery at four, riflery at five?

694
00:48:13,354 --> 00:48:15,657
A little early-bird dinner at six?

695
00:48:15,757 --> 00:48:18,426
Goddamn it, you leave the game,
even for a while,

696
00:48:18,526 --> 00:48:20,562
I don't know if they'll let you back in.

697
00:48:20,662 --> 00:48:22,263
And then what are you gonna do?

698
00:48:22,363 --> 00:48:24,599
Waste days picking up
illiterate teenagers..

699
00:48:24,699 --> 00:48:27,902
for suck-and-fuck sessions
behind the Old Navy store?

700
00:48:28,002 --> 00:48:31,106
- Sounds delightful to me.
- Julian, do this job.

701
00:48:31,206 --> 00:48:34,142
If you don't, you're going to regret it,
I promise you.

702
00:48:34,242 --> 00:48:36,242
How do you know?

703
00:48:40,148 --> 00:48:43,879
Just do it, Julian.
Please, do it. OK?

704
00:50:39,867 --> 00:50:41,867
Oh.

705
00:51:10,665 --> 00:51:12,967
We have a problem, Mr. Randy.

706
00:51:13,067 --> 00:51:15,558
The problem is Julian Noble.

707
00:51:15,637 --> 00:51:18,867
Seems he didn't deliver the portfolio.

708
00:51:20,108 --> 00:51:21,809
You know..

709
00:51:21,909 --> 00:51:25,401
it says it took 53 years..

710
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,605
to paint this ceiling.

711
00:51:28,783 --> 00:51:31,980
People are upset, Mr. Randy.

712
00:51:32,053 --> 00:51:34,487
Mr. Stick is upset.

713
00:51:35,890 --> 00:51:37,258
Mr. Stick knows?

714
00:51:37,358 --> 00:51:39,358
Mr. Stick knows.

715
00:51:41,362 --> 00:51:43,827
Well, he knows we can fix it.

716
00:51:47,068 --> 00:51:49,068
I'm just the messenger.

717
00:51:49,103 --> 00:51:51,239
But he knows we can fix it.

718
00:51:51,339 --> 00:51:53,241
We always fix any problems.

719
00:51:53,341 --> 00:51:55,721
You can't fix it with Noble.

720
00:51:55,877 --> 00:51:57,877
Ladies.

721
00:51:58,579 --> 00:52:01,104
All right. I'll replace him.

722
00:52:01,182 --> 00:52:02,350
No.

723
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:05,851
Yes, you'll replace him,

724
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,355
but no.

725
00:52:07,455 --> 00:52:10,891
Mr. Stick has asked for other things.

726
00:52:10,958 --> 00:52:12,958
No, it's ridiculous.

727
00:52:13,027 --> 00:52:15,697
Julian has been with us for 22 years.

728
00:52:15,797 --> 00:52:17,165
Two little mistakes..

729
00:52:17,265 --> 00:52:20,359
Julian Noble.. is a dead man.

730
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:31,879
Oh. Ohh. Oh, yeah.

731
00:52:31,946 --> 00:52:34,882
- Oh, that's it, Danny boy.
- Oh, yeah.

732
00:52:34,982 --> 00:52:37,644
Give it to me, Danny boy.

733
00:52:41,823 --> 00:52:44,383
Danny boy. Oh. Uh.

734
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,961
Oh. Excellent.

735
00:52:56,270 --> 00:52:57,972
- Oh.

736
00:52:58,072 --> 00:53:01,473
- Laundry's done.
- Oh.

737
00:53:15,123 --> 00:53:17,785
Tomorrow's four years.

738
00:53:18,826 --> 00:53:20,826
I know.

739
00:53:23,097 --> 00:53:27,687
It's such a long time, really,
when you think about it.

740
00:53:28,669 --> 00:53:31,433
Seems like yesterday, right?

741
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:35,067
Henry was alive..

742
00:53:36,878 --> 00:53:38,878
here.

743
00:53:43,651 --> 00:53:47,155
When I was first in high school,
I told you they made fun of me.

744
00:53:47,255 --> 00:53:50,315
And they called me Hippo Hips..

745
00:53:50,391 --> 00:53:53,588
and Plate of Beans, the works.

746
00:53:55,763 --> 00:53:58,266
And even though I did basketball..

747
00:53:58,366 --> 00:54:00,661
and.. and chorus and..

748
00:54:00,668 --> 00:54:04,536
And I had a few friends
and I acted strong..

749
00:54:04,605 --> 00:54:06,835
I never was.

750
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:13,415
Because I believed them always,
every last cruel word.

751
00:54:14,348 --> 00:54:15,783
And I..

752
00:54:15,883 --> 00:54:19,113
I always thought I would believe them.

753
00:54:19,921 --> 00:54:22,116
Until I met you.

754
00:54:25,693 --> 00:54:28,321
You arrived in 12th grade..

755
00:54:30,364 --> 00:54:33,731
and you told me that I was pretty.

756
00:54:33,801 --> 00:54:36,671
And for the first time,
I believed it.

757
00:54:36,771 --> 00:54:39,672
You told me that I was sexy.

758
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:43,335
You were sexy back there on the dryer.

759
00:54:44,478 --> 00:54:47,470
And when Henry died..

760
00:54:47,548 --> 00:54:51,507
you told me to stay strong..

761
00:54:51,586 --> 00:54:54,646
and that we would get through it.

762
00:54:55,857 --> 00:54:58,018
And we did.

763
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:01,690
We did.

764
00:55:09,337 --> 00:55:11,405
It's because you never gave up on me.

765
00:55:11,505 --> 00:55:13,700
I never could.

766
00:55:15,142 --> 00:55:17,235
I never will.

767
00:55:28,956 --> 00:55:32,016
Who could that be at 11:30 at night?

768
00:55:38,399 --> 00:55:40,399
Yeah?

769
00:55:40,601 --> 00:55:42,601
Danny Wright?

770
00:55:42,737 --> 00:55:44,898
Yes. Who's there?

771
00:55:44,972 --> 00:55:48,032
Danny, Danny.

772
00:55:48,109 --> 00:55:50,914
Danny with the large white fanny.

773
00:55:52,546 --> 00:55:55,616
- Julian.
- Would you mind opening up, Danny?

774
00:55:55,716 --> 00:55:59,881
It's freezing out here.
My balls are like bonbons.

775
00:56:03,224 --> 00:56:06,057
I was praying you'd remember me.

776
00:56:06,127 --> 00:56:07,428
It's been a spell.

777
00:56:08,996 --> 00:56:10,565
Please, please, come on..

778
00:56:10,665 --> 00:56:13,555
- Come on in.
- Thank you, thank you.

779
00:56:16,137 --> 00:56:18,137
Oooh.

780
00:56:19,407 --> 00:56:20,775
Hey.

781
00:56:20,875 --> 00:56:23,173
Oh, I decided to..

782
00:56:23,244 --> 00:56:24,979
How did you find me?

783
00:56:25,079 --> 00:56:27,181
I found a whore with a heart of gold once.

784
00:56:27,281 --> 00:56:30,151
I can find Danny Wright's card
in my address book.

785
00:56:31,652 --> 00:56:32,854
Oh.

786
00:56:32,954 --> 00:56:35,189
Oh, excuse me.
I didn't realize. Sorry.

787
00:56:35,289 --> 00:56:37,289
It's OK.

788
00:56:38,392 --> 00:56:40,392
You must be Bean.

789
00:56:40,795 --> 00:56:42,888
- My wife.
- Oh, this..

790
00:56:42,964 --> 00:56:45,933
- Um..
- Oh, my..

791
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
My boots.

792
00:56:49,971 --> 00:56:51,539
I've heard so much about you.

793
00:56:51,639 --> 00:56:53,937
And me, you.

794
00:56:54,008 --> 00:56:56,008
Oh..

795
00:56:58,546 --> 00:57:02,984
There's no doubt you're every bit
as lovely as Danny said.

796
00:57:03,084 --> 00:57:05,084
Danny..

797
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:09,970
I always said you were
the luckiest man I ever met.

798
00:57:10,758 --> 00:57:12,758
Well..

799
00:57:16,964 --> 00:57:19,797
What are you doing here, Julian?

800
00:57:29,010 --> 00:57:31,376
I really don't know.

801
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:34,580
I don't know.

802
00:57:35,583 --> 00:57:38,653
I hope it's all right, my being here.
I mean..

803
00:57:38,753 --> 00:57:41,255
I guess it's the middle
of the night..

804
00:57:41,355 --> 00:57:43,482
- Yes, it's..
- Well..

805
00:57:43,557 --> 00:57:46,287
I could sure use some coffee.

806
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:48,419
Just a cup.

807
00:57:48,496 --> 00:57:50,364
Yes. All right.

808
00:57:50,464 --> 00:57:52,033
Of course.
I could get coffee.

809
00:57:52,133 --> 00:57:53,868
That'd be great.

810
00:57:53,968 --> 00:57:55,703
- Or some whiskey?
- Even better.

811
00:57:55,803 --> 00:57:58,806
- Mm.
- Tonight's a night for whiskey, then.

812
00:57:58,906 --> 00:58:00,906
And song and dance.

813
00:58:01,776 --> 00:58:04,301
Well, whiskey, at least.

814
00:58:07,214 --> 00:58:09,842
This is really odd.

815
00:58:09,917 --> 00:58:11,917
Really, really odd.

816
00:58:11,952 --> 00:58:13,821
I could ask him to leave.

817
00:58:13,921 --> 00:58:15,957
We just asked him to stay.

818
00:58:16,057 --> 00:58:18,059
We could change our minds.

819
00:58:18,159 --> 00:58:20,964
Why? Do you think he's dangerous?

820
00:58:21,996 --> 00:58:25,032
He's an assassin, Bean.
Of course he's dangerous.

821
00:58:25,132 --> 00:58:27,335
But I mean 'dangerous' dangerous.

822
00:58:27,435 --> 00:58:29,203
You said he was a nice guy.

823
00:58:29,303 --> 00:58:32,898
He is. For an assassin,
he's.. very nice.

824
00:58:34,008 --> 00:58:35,476
Fuck.

825
00:58:35,576 --> 00:58:37,576
Fuckity-fuck.

826
00:58:38,345 --> 00:58:40,481
What? I'm allowed to curse.

827
00:58:40,581 --> 00:58:43,379
Especially now.
If not now, when?

828
00:58:43,451 --> 00:58:45,152
True.

829
00:58:45,252 --> 00:58:46,988
This is the fucking perfect time..

830
00:58:47,088 --> 00:58:48,789
to be fucking cursing.

831
00:58:48,889 --> 00:58:50,658
There's a fucking killer..

832
00:58:50,758 --> 00:58:54,073
standing in our fucking living room.

833
00:58:56,597 --> 00:58:59,827
Do you think he would show me his gun?

834
00:59:06,006 --> 00:59:08,031
A toast, maybe?

835
00:59:08,109 --> 00:59:09,777
To a stranger,

836
00:59:09,877 --> 00:59:12,213
arriving in the middle of the night.

837
00:59:12,313 --> 00:59:13,848
Well, you're not a stranger.

838
00:59:13,948 --> 00:59:15,783
Well, I'm pretty strange.

839
00:59:15,883 --> 00:59:18,786
Be that as it may,
you're not a stranger, Julian.

840
00:59:18,886 --> 00:59:20,321
Far from it.

841
00:59:20,421 --> 00:59:23,557
The toast really should be to you, Danny.

842
00:59:23,657 --> 00:59:25,126
And to you, Bean.

843
00:59:25,226 --> 00:59:28,371
For your hospitality and your warmth.

844
00:59:35,202 --> 00:59:36,937
Oh.

845
00:59:37,037 --> 00:59:39,037
Hmm.

846
00:59:39,039 --> 00:59:41,442
I never thought I'd see you again, Julian.

847
00:59:41,542 --> 00:59:43,677
I never thought I'd see you again, Danny.

848
00:59:43,777 --> 00:59:44,945
But, well..

849
00:59:45,045 --> 00:59:46,647
things, uh..

850
00:59:46,747 --> 00:59:50,478
Things change.
They just change.

851
00:59:50,551 --> 00:59:52,551
Is that?

852
00:59:54,622 --> 00:59:57,750
- You saved it.
- I did.

853
00:59:57,825 --> 00:59:59,794
You saved it.
I can't believe it.

854
00:59:59,894 --> 01:00:03,297
- He still talks about that.
- No, it's..

855
01:00:03,397 --> 01:00:05,433
It touches me that you kept it.

856
01:00:05,533 --> 01:00:06,801
How could I not?

857
01:00:06,901 --> 01:00:09,495
- That was a special day.
- Yes.

858
01:00:09,570 --> 01:00:12,232
So Danny told you what I did?

859
01:00:12,306 --> 01:00:14,467
Professionally?

860
01:00:15,776 --> 01:00:18,939
Did you bring your gun?

861
01:00:19,013 --> 01:00:22,312
Yes.. as a matter of fact.

862
01:00:22,383 --> 01:00:24,383
May I see it?

863
01:00:24,385 --> 01:00:25,953
Really?

864
01:00:26,053 --> 01:00:28,222
- Yes, please.
- Honey, he's not just..

865
01:00:28,322 --> 01:00:30,322
- Here you go.
- OK.

866
01:00:37,731 --> 01:00:39,731
Is that a.38?

867
01:00:39,767 --> 01:00:41,302
Yes, it is.

868
01:00:41,402 --> 01:00:43,836
You know your guns, Bean.

869
01:00:43,904 --> 01:00:46,270
Yes, well..

870
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:47,975
My God.

871
01:00:48,075 --> 01:00:50,976
You are a magnificent woman.

872
01:00:51,045 --> 01:00:52,379
Hm.

873
01:00:52,479 --> 01:00:55,716
Bean knows a lot of things
about a lot of things.

874
01:00:55,816 --> 01:00:57,451
Bean, tell me,

875
01:00:57,551 --> 01:00:59,487
did Danny tell you everything..

876
01:00:59,587 --> 01:01:01,789
about our time in Mexico together?

877
01:01:01,889 --> 01:01:03,948
Yes, I'm sure. Why?

878
01:01:05,192 --> 01:01:07,192
Oh.

879
01:01:09,330 --> 01:01:12,163
My God, you look great, Danny.

880
01:01:12,233 --> 01:01:13,868
Really great.

881
01:01:13,968 --> 01:01:16,436
- You do too, Julian.
- Oh, no.

882
01:01:16,503 --> 01:01:19,240
I look like a Bangkok hooker
on a Sunday morning..

883
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:21,342
after the Navy left town.

884
01:01:21,442 --> 01:01:22,710
But you..

885
01:01:22,810 --> 01:01:24,979
Life's been good to you,
am I right?

886
01:01:25,079 --> 01:01:26,614
Pretty good, yeah.

887
01:01:26,714 --> 01:01:30,151
Your work? You have that respect
you wanted back again?

888
01:01:30,251 --> 01:01:31,852
I do.

889
01:01:31,952 --> 01:01:34,188
So you got that job
you were in Mexico for?

890
01:01:34,288 --> 01:01:35,523
We did.

891
01:01:35,623 --> 01:01:37,558
And your luck?
It's better, right?

892
01:01:37,658 --> 01:01:40,123
No more trees in the kitchen?

893
01:01:40,928 --> 01:01:43,396
You told him about that?

894
01:01:43,464 --> 01:01:45,733
And you love Bean more than ever.

895
01:01:45,833 --> 01:01:48,358
Mm. That I do.

896
01:01:48,435 --> 01:01:51,233
Then what more could you want?

897
01:01:51,305 --> 01:01:52,673
Here's a toast.

898
01:01:52,773 --> 01:01:56,174
To a man with respect again,

899
01:01:56,243 --> 01:01:59,847
to a woman who's more lovely
than any man deserves..

900
01:01:59,947 --> 01:02:01,715
and to me.

901
01:02:01,815 --> 01:02:04,943
What is the toast to you for?

902
01:02:05,019 --> 01:02:07,317
Toast to a dead man, Bean.

903
01:02:08,389 --> 01:02:10,789
Toast to a dead man.

904
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:16,530
Then about two months ago
I had this job in Manila.

905
01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:19,133
Now, normally,
this would make me happy.

906
01:02:19,233 --> 01:02:20,601
I like the hot climate.

907
01:02:20,701 --> 01:02:23,304
The guys look like chicks.
It's fucking fantastic.

908
01:02:23,404 --> 01:02:26,567
The thing was,
I was burnt-out.

909
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:30,110
I didn't know it, didn't even know
what 'burnt-out' meant at the time.

910
01:02:30,210 --> 01:02:34,203
But I was.
I was a classic textbook case.

911
01:02:41,121 --> 01:02:43,023
I was having panic attacks.

912
01:02:43,123 --> 01:02:45,292
I was completely losing control of myself.

913
01:02:45,392 --> 01:02:47,761
I tried to counter this
with booze, of course,

914
01:02:47,861 --> 01:02:49,730
but nothing was working.

915
01:02:49,830 --> 01:02:52,993
I drank and drank and..

916
01:02:53,067 --> 01:02:54,568
nothing.

917
01:02:54,668 --> 01:02:56,136
I was still feeling edgy,

918
01:02:56,236 --> 01:02:59,139
still feeling like
my head was going to explode.

919
01:02:59,239 --> 01:03:00,808
So..

920
01:03:00,908 --> 01:03:03,777
I moved on to my other
usual diversions.

921
01:03:03,877 --> 01:03:05,846
A wonderful little whorehouse I knew..

922
01:03:05,946 --> 01:03:09,211
right off of Mabini Street.

923
01:03:09,283 --> 01:03:11,979
But that wasn't workin' either.

924
01:03:12,052 --> 01:03:14,121
And a good fuck usually does.

925
01:03:14,221 --> 01:03:16,221
Excuse my French.

926
01:03:16,523 --> 01:03:18,459
- Go on.
- So I had this assignment.

927
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:21,228
Nothing special,
some copper wire executive,

928
01:03:21,328 --> 01:03:23,030
someone doesn't want him around.

929
01:03:23,130 --> 01:03:25,462
You know, my usual type gig.

930
01:03:25,532 --> 01:03:27,568
Well, I knew that this copper wire guy..

931
01:03:27,668 --> 01:03:31,372
always came to this sweaty little
outdoor market every Thursday..

932
01:03:31,472 --> 01:03:33,472
to buy fruit.

933
01:03:33,774 --> 01:03:35,935
The guy liked his fruit.

934
01:03:43,684 --> 01:03:45,352
It was a simple plan.

935
01:03:45,452 --> 01:03:48,455
As he walks through the crowds
I bump into him..

936
01:03:48,555 --> 01:03:50,750
and stab him.

937
01:04:00,634 --> 01:04:03,439
The thing was,
I was still a mess.

938
01:04:05,939 --> 01:04:08,676
And every time I looked at the guy,
I didn't see him,

939
01:04:08,776 --> 01:04:11,802
but I saw a little boy instead.

940
01:04:19,953 --> 01:04:22,319
And it wasn't just any boy.

941
01:04:23,490 --> 01:04:24,858
It was me.

942
01:04:24,958 --> 01:04:27,051
Me, as a child.

943
01:04:30,197 --> 01:04:32,407
It was freaky shit, right?

944
01:04:34,201 --> 01:04:37,932
Real nervous breakdown sort of stuff.

945
01:04:43,811 --> 01:04:47,181
Still readied the knife,
still prepared for the job.

946
01:04:47,281 --> 01:04:49,281
But..

947
01:04:52,553 --> 01:04:54,817
I couldn't do it.

948
01:04:54,888 --> 01:04:57,356
I just couldn't do it.

949
01:05:08,735 --> 01:05:09,903
Then what happened?

950
01:05:10,003 --> 01:05:12,978
I woke up in a pile of donkey shit.

951
01:05:13,407 --> 01:05:15,407
I fainted.

952
01:05:15,442 --> 01:05:18,445
And I guess I landed
in a pile of donkey shit.

953
01:05:22,983 --> 01:05:24,418
And since then,

954
01:05:24,518 --> 01:05:26,920
it's been extremely hot and cold.

955
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:31,354
Some jobs go OK,
others not so OK.

956
01:05:33,427 --> 01:05:36,630
And then a few weeks ago
I fucked up again. In Budapest.

957
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:38,432
Froze.

958
01:05:38,532 --> 01:05:41,201
Right at the moment
I should have been firing.

959
01:05:41,301 --> 01:05:44,031
Couldn't finish the job.

960
01:05:44,104 --> 01:05:46,104
And that was that.

961
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:49,615
And now it's just a matter of time.

962
01:05:49,843 --> 01:05:53,180
Well, isn't there somebody
that you can talk to?

963
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,849
Like Mary Beth in Human Resources?

964
01:05:55,949 --> 01:05:58,318
Come on, this is..
this is insane.

965
01:05:58,418 --> 01:06:00,587
They're gonna kill you for botching a job?

966
01:06:00,687 --> 01:06:01,855
Mm..hm.

967
01:06:01,955 --> 01:06:04,625
Well, can't you just,
you know, say to them,

968
01:06:04,725 --> 01:06:07,294
you know, 'You know what? I'm sorry.

969
01:06:07,394 --> 01:06:09,196
You know,
I was a little burned out,

970
01:06:09,296 --> 01:06:10,831
and I'm a little messed up.'

971
01:06:10,931 --> 01:06:14,298
I mean, can't you do that?
But..

972
01:06:14,368 --> 01:06:18,272
I mean, you were seeing images
of yourself as a small boy.

973
01:06:18,372 --> 01:06:21,275
If that's not a Freudian meltdown,
I don't know what is.

974
01:06:21,375 --> 01:06:23,310
But certainly,
they have to see that.

975
01:06:23,410 --> 01:06:25,674
No, they don't.
They don't.

976
01:06:25,746 --> 01:06:27,281
I mean, I..

977
01:06:27,381 --> 01:06:29,750
I'd be dead if my handler
hadn't risked his life..

978
01:06:29,850 --> 01:06:31,552
and tipped me off to the plans.

979
01:06:31,652 --> 01:06:34,712
I barely got out of Budapest alive.

980
01:06:34,788 --> 01:06:36,824
And how did you end up here?

981
01:06:36,924 --> 01:06:38,559
In Denver?

982
01:06:38,659 --> 01:06:40,659
Hm.

983
01:06:41,895 --> 01:06:43,895
That's funny.

984
01:06:44,932 --> 01:06:48,595
Some people run home in a time of crisis.

985
01:06:49,670 --> 01:06:51,338
My problem,

986
01:06:51,438 --> 01:06:54,074
the problem I shared with Danny in Mexico,

987
01:06:54,174 --> 01:06:56,554
is that I don't have a home.

988
01:06:56,610 --> 01:06:59,204
I mean..

989
01:06:59,279 --> 01:07:01,645
that's why I'm here.

990
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:05,700
You're the only friend I have.

991
01:07:06,119 --> 01:07:08,455
Oh, well, that's..
that's ridiculous.

992
01:07:08,555 --> 01:07:11,445
I.. You have.. you have friends.

993
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:15,529
I don't.

994
01:07:15,629 --> 01:07:18,029
I really don't.

995
01:07:18,098 --> 01:07:20,328
You all right?

996
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:23,545
It's fucking crazy, right?

997
01:07:24,237 --> 01:07:26,673
You're my only friend,
and I barely know you.

998
01:07:28,108 --> 01:07:30,599
This home..

999
01:07:33,146 --> 01:07:34,848
your home..

1000
01:07:36,783 --> 01:07:39,248
it's the only home I know.

1001
01:07:41,989 --> 01:07:45,292
God, she's really fantastic, Danny.

1002
01:07:45,392 --> 01:07:47,622
She's lovely.

1003
01:07:47,694 --> 01:07:49,763
She's everything to me.

1004
01:07:49,863 --> 01:07:52,559
You said that to me in Mexico.

1005
01:07:52,633 --> 01:07:55,363
And I nodded and listened..

1006
01:07:55,869 --> 01:07:58,133
but now I see.

1007
01:07:59,306 --> 01:08:01,306
I see.

1008
01:08:02,242 --> 01:08:04,242
You were right.

1009
01:08:08,515 --> 01:08:12,510
You told her everything
that happened in Mexico?

1010
01:08:13,654 --> 01:08:17,054
I told her about our time together, yes.

1011
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:22,021
And where does that story end?

1012
01:08:25,165 --> 01:08:27,167
She knows the last I heard of you..

1013
01:08:27,267 --> 01:08:29,970
you were knocking on my room
in the middle of the night..

1014
01:08:30,070 --> 01:08:34,745
asking forgiveness for trying
to involve me in a job.

1015
01:08:35,142 --> 01:08:37,508
That's what you said?

1016
01:08:37,744 --> 01:08:40,338
That I knocked and knocked.

1017
01:08:40,414 --> 01:08:42,541
And you never answered?

1018
01:08:44,418 --> 01:08:46,418
Yes.

1019
01:08:47,621 --> 01:08:49,621
Gentlemen.

1020
01:08:51,191 --> 01:08:53,660
I'm a bit drunk.

1021
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:56,024
That's a nice place to be.

1022
01:08:56,096 --> 01:08:59,032
Julian, you will stay the night,
of course?

1023
01:08:59,132 --> 01:09:01,191
Oh, thank you, Bean.

1024
01:09:01,268 --> 01:09:03,470
I promise I'll be out of here tomorrow.

1025
01:09:03,570 --> 01:09:05,639
Oh, let's not talk about that now.

1026
01:09:05,739 --> 01:09:08,141
You know, I don't think
I've been up with a guest..

1027
01:09:08,241 --> 01:09:11,211
till 2:30 in the morning
in a long time.

1028
01:09:11,311 --> 01:09:12,346
It's good, right?

1029
01:09:12,446 --> 01:09:14,914
- Oh, it's very good.
- Hey..

1030
01:09:14,981 --> 01:09:16,850
Can I turn on your stereo?

1031
01:09:16,950 --> 01:09:19,820
- Sure. Now?
- Yeah, I saw this old record of yours,

1032
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:24,024
and I just wanted to hear In the Wee
Small Hours of the Morning. You know?

1033
01:09:24,124 --> 01:09:26,760
Since we're in the wee small hours
of the morning?

1034
01:09:26,860 --> 01:09:28,261
Is that OK?

1035
01:09:28,361 --> 01:09:30,361
Certainly. I guess.

1036
01:09:45,178 --> 01:09:47,014
Danny.

1037
01:09:47,114 --> 01:09:49,776
I hope you approve, but..

1038
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:53,930
I would really like
to ask your wife to dance.

1039
01:09:56,123 --> 01:09:59,438
Julian, you have had too much to drink.

1040
01:10:01,261 --> 01:10:02,562
Bean.

1041
01:10:02,662 --> 01:10:04,698
Please, may I have this dance?

1042
01:11:11,598 --> 01:11:14,935
I learned to dance in a South American
jail by a chap named Morales.

1043
01:11:15,035 --> 01:11:17,237
Well, that's another story,
another time.

1044
01:11:17,337 --> 01:11:19,635
The final nightcap.

1045
01:11:19,706 --> 01:11:22,309
I can't think about the headache
I'm gonna have.

1046
01:11:22,409 --> 01:11:25,045
Then don't. Or do.
Take three aspirins and a raw egg..

1047
01:11:25,145 --> 01:11:26,646
before you go to bed.

1048
01:11:26,746 --> 01:11:30,317
Where'd you hear that one?
The Assassin's Book of Home Remedies?

1049
01:11:35,055 --> 01:11:37,190
The only woman I ever loved.

1050
01:11:37,290 --> 01:11:39,451
My mother.

1051
01:11:39,526 --> 01:11:42,518
- What about your wife?
- Hm?

1052
01:11:42,596 --> 01:11:45,766
- My wife?
- Danny told me that you were married..

1053
01:11:45,866 --> 01:11:49,870
and that she died in a car accident.
You loved her.

1054
01:11:49,970 --> 01:11:51,970
Um..

1055
01:12:02,048 --> 01:12:03,650
Oh, my God.

1056
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:05,352
I can't believe this.

1057
01:12:05,452 --> 01:12:07,287
I was never married.

1058
01:12:07,387 --> 01:12:09,790
- I can't believe this.
- No car accident?

1059
01:12:09,890 --> 01:12:13,360
No. I'd been insensitive
to Danny about your son..

1060
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:15,796
and was trying to win him over.
It was stupid.

1061
01:12:15,896 --> 01:12:18,165
You know what,
I'm the one that was stupid.

1062
01:12:18,265 --> 01:12:19,266
No, no, no, no, no.

1063
01:12:19,366 --> 01:12:22,836
You're not stupid.
I'm a prick. Me, not you.

1064
01:12:22,936 --> 01:12:25,305
The thing is, I could have
kept lying to you now,

1065
01:12:25,405 --> 01:12:27,607
but I chose not to,
as a sign of respect.

1066
01:12:27,707 --> 01:12:30,377
Because.. well, now we're friends.

1067
01:12:30,477 --> 01:12:32,477
Oh.

1068
01:12:33,179 --> 01:12:34,548
We are friends, aren't we?

1069
01:12:34,648 --> 01:12:37,217
So, what other bullshit
did you pour over me?

1070
01:12:37,317 --> 01:12:39,386
Yeah, are you even a hit man, Julian?

1071
01:12:39,486 --> 01:12:43,857
Yeah, a facility fatalitator,
whatever the fuck you call yourself.

1072
01:12:43,957 --> 01:12:45,258
Yes, I am.

1073
01:12:45,358 --> 01:12:48,728
And to answer your question,
Danny, I lie when I need to,

1074
01:12:48,828 --> 01:12:50,530
tell the truth when I can.

1075
01:12:50,630 --> 01:12:52,630
With you..

1076
01:12:53,033 --> 01:12:55,583
it's mostly been the truth.

1077
01:13:03,977 --> 01:13:06,275
Shall I go?

1078
01:13:11,284 --> 01:13:12,686
No.

1079
01:13:12,786 --> 01:13:14,786
No.

1080
01:13:16,289 --> 01:13:18,289
No..

1081
01:13:20,860 --> 01:13:23,693
Aren't we fucking cosmopolitan?

1082
01:13:24,798 --> 01:13:28,335
Having a trained assassin
stay over the night.

1083
01:13:28,435 --> 01:13:29,870
Letting heartbreaking lies..

1084
01:13:29,970 --> 01:13:33,406
just roll over us like
the summer breeze.

1085
01:13:33,506 --> 01:13:36,481
Next we shall be wife swapping. Ha.

1086
01:13:37,978 --> 01:13:40,071
You don't have a wife.

1087
01:13:40,146 --> 01:13:42,146
Remember?

1088
01:13:48,755 --> 01:13:50,755
That's a good point.

1089
01:14:06,573 --> 01:14:08,573
Danny.

1090
01:14:09,109 --> 01:14:11,109
Danny.

1091
01:14:16,616 --> 01:14:19,813
- Danny.
- No. I don't like chicken.

1092
01:14:19,886 --> 01:14:22,821
Come on.
I've gotta talk to you.

1093
01:14:26,259 --> 01:14:28,395
What is it, Julian?
What do you want?

1094
01:14:28,495 --> 01:14:30,397
We can't talk about it here.

1095
01:14:30,497 --> 01:14:32,497
- What?
- Come on.

1096
01:14:35,535 --> 01:14:39,039
OK, Julian,
we're in your rent-a-car.

1097
01:14:39,139 --> 01:14:41,875
- What is it?
- The thing is, Danny..

1098
01:14:41,975 --> 01:14:43,877
the thing I didn't tell you,

1099
01:14:43,977 --> 01:14:47,480
the thing that I omitted
because Bean was present,

1100
01:14:47,580 --> 01:14:52,680
was that I've been offered a way
out of my fatal predicament.

1101
01:14:53,019 --> 01:14:55,221
- Well, that's good.
- I know, I know.

1102
01:14:55,321 --> 01:14:57,557
No, that's really good.
What is it?

1103
01:14:57,657 --> 01:15:01,361
My handler, Mr. Randy,
contacted me like he always does..

1104
01:15:01,461 --> 01:15:05,198
with an ad in the International Tribune
looking for cat-sitters in Bali.

1105
01:15:05,298 --> 01:15:08,468
Is that how you stay in contact?
Cat-sitter ads?

1106
01:15:08,568 --> 01:15:10,303
Yeah.

1107
01:15:10,403 --> 01:15:12,172
OK, you know,
this is ridiculous.

1108
01:15:12,272 --> 01:15:14,474
- I'm so tired, Julian.
- Well, anyway,

1109
01:15:14,574 --> 01:15:16,476
he contacted me four days ago..

1110
01:15:16,576 --> 01:15:19,045
and basically said
he'd been to the higher-ups..

1111
01:15:19,145 --> 01:15:21,047
and got me a reprieve.

1112
01:15:21,147 --> 01:15:24,284
Well, like I said, that's..
that's.. great news.

1113
01:15:24,384 --> 01:15:26,614
The thing is..

1114
01:15:26,686 --> 01:15:29,022
he's asked me to do one more job.

1115
01:15:29,122 --> 01:15:31,224
I have no choice.
It's do the job or else.

1116
01:15:31,324 --> 01:15:32,492
Right.

1117
01:15:32,592 --> 01:15:36,502
And that brings us
to the dirty little problem.

1118
01:15:37,764 --> 01:15:39,764
All right.

1119
01:15:40,567 --> 01:15:41,768
What's the problem?

1120
01:15:41,868 --> 01:15:45,438
It's a pretty big problem,
and you're really not gonna like it.

1121
01:15:45,538 --> 01:15:47,874
- I'm not gonna like it?
- Not at all.

1122
01:15:47,974 --> 01:15:50,442
Because the job..

1123
01:15:52,312 --> 01:15:54,312
involves you.

1124
01:15:57,550 --> 01:15:59,853
You're not saying
what I think you're saying.

1125
01:15:59,953 --> 01:16:02,188
What do you think I'm saying?

1126
01:16:02,288 --> 01:16:05,191
You know what I think you're saying.

1127
01:16:05,291 --> 01:16:09,541
No. I don't think I know
what you think I'm saying.

1128
01:16:10,964 --> 01:16:13,899
Does somebody want me dead?

1129
01:16:23,309 --> 01:16:25,539
- No.
- What's that?

1130
01:16:25,612 --> 01:16:27,213
No one wants you dead, Danny.

1131
01:16:27,313 --> 01:16:31,909
- Jesus.
- You scared me.

1132
01:16:31,985 --> 01:16:34,078
No. No..

1133
01:16:34,154 --> 01:16:36,349
You were doing that..

1134
01:16:36,422 --> 01:16:39,125
But I need your help
in facilitating a fatality.

1135
01:16:39,225 --> 01:16:40,560
- What?
- I need your help.

1136
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:43,563
No, no, no.
My help is exactly what you don't need.

1137
01:16:43,663 --> 01:16:45,432
I'm a mess, Danny, you know that.

1138
01:16:45,532 --> 01:16:46,733
I'm a complete mess.

1139
01:16:46,833 --> 01:16:48,935
I don't know if I can do
this job by myself.

1140
01:16:49,035 --> 01:16:51,304
You gotta talk
to somebody else, a colleague.

1141
01:16:51,404 --> 01:16:53,273
- I don't know colleagues.
- You must.

1142
01:16:53,373 --> 01:16:55,608
- I don't.
- Well, I can't help you.

1143
01:16:55,708 --> 01:16:57,977
I know you're not the ideal candidate..

1144
01:16:58,077 --> 01:17:01,672
No. I'm far, far from ideal, Julian.

1145
01:17:01,748 --> 01:17:05,452
Remember my reaction the last time
you proposed something this asinine?

1146
01:17:05,552 --> 01:17:08,354
That was Mexico.
I was trying to show you a good time.

1147
01:17:08,454 --> 01:17:10,857
Oh, so now killing somebody
is a good time?

1148
01:17:10,957 --> 01:17:12,425
Can be.

1149
01:17:12,525 --> 01:17:14,928
- Oh.. I'm going to sleep.
- Danny, come on.

1150
01:17:15,028 --> 01:17:17,230
You don't even need a second person.

1151
01:17:17,330 --> 01:17:19,399
Haven't you done these things yourself?

1152
01:17:19,499 --> 01:17:21,434
Some jobs are better with two men.

1153
01:17:21,534 --> 01:17:24,938
I think it's better
if the second man isn't scared shitless,

1154
01:17:25,038 --> 01:17:26,406
and.. and unprepared.

1155
01:17:26,506 --> 01:17:29,008
And unqualified and uninterested.

1156
01:17:29,108 --> 01:17:30,443
Now I'm gonna go to bed.

1157
01:17:30,543 --> 01:17:32,812
I'm in a very dangerous position here.

1158
01:17:32,912 --> 01:17:34,914
I'm in no shape to try this myself.

1159
01:17:35,014 --> 01:17:37,951
An assassin without confidence
is a horrible thing.

1160
01:17:38,051 --> 01:17:42,131
It's like a relief pitcher
who fumbles the ball.

1161
01:17:42,288 --> 01:17:44,991
Tell me you know you mixed
two sports in your metaphor.

1162
01:17:45,091 --> 01:17:47,091
Huh? I can't do that.

1163
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:49,160
Yeah.

1164
01:17:50,163 --> 01:17:51,798
Danny. Danny, please.

1165
01:17:51,898 --> 01:17:53,366
I need your help.

1166
01:17:53,466 --> 01:17:55,568
Someone's gonna die,
a stranger or me.

1167
01:17:55,668 --> 01:17:58,296
Which would you rather? Hm?

1168
01:17:58,371 --> 01:18:00,371
Look,

1169
01:18:00,406 --> 01:18:03,076
if I can do the job successfully,
I'm free and clear.

1170
01:18:03,176 --> 01:18:04,544
Free and clear, Danny.

1171
01:18:04,644 --> 01:18:07,514
I have enough money to retire
to a beautiful Greek island..

1172
01:18:07,614 --> 01:18:08,848
with beautiful Greeks.

1173
01:18:08,948 --> 01:18:11,518
Heaven awaits me, Danny,
if you and I do this job.

1174
01:18:11,618 --> 01:18:13,920
- I can't.
- Oh, damn it, Danny.

1175
01:18:14,020 --> 01:18:16,079
You're my only friend.

1176
01:18:16,155 --> 01:18:17,824
- Oh, Julian.
- It's true.

1177
01:18:17,924 --> 01:18:19,159
And..

1178
01:18:19,259 --> 01:18:21,523
- Oh..
- And what?

1179
01:18:21,594 --> 01:18:24,085
And..

1180
01:18:25,431 --> 01:18:27,991
You owe me.

1181
01:18:31,437 --> 01:18:34,440
If this were to happen,
when would it take place?

1182
01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:36,974
Today. The horse races.

1183
01:18:38,444 --> 01:18:40,444
- Today?
- Yeah, Arizona.

1184
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:41,948
No, that couldn't happen.

1185
01:18:42,048 --> 01:18:44,048
Sorry, no choice.

1186
01:18:44,684 --> 01:18:47,887
Today is the four-year anniversary
of my son Henry's death.

1187
01:18:47,987 --> 01:18:50,290
We go to the cemetery.
That's what we do.

1188
01:18:50,390 --> 01:18:53,092
What time does
the cemetery close, Danny?

1189
01:18:53,192 --> 01:18:54,894
Well, I..I don't know.

1190
01:18:54,994 --> 01:18:57,964
We'll have you back at 4:30,
flowers in hand. I promise.

1191
01:18:58,064 --> 01:19:00,274
Oh. Oh.
You'll do that? OK.

1192
01:19:00,333 --> 01:19:01,901
How will you do that, Julian?

1193
01:19:02,001 --> 01:19:05,505
Well, we have a 7:40 plane reservation
to Tucson this morning.

1194
01:19:05,605 --> 01:19:07,640
Plenty of time to catch the 2:30 back.

1195
01:19:07,740 --> 01:19:09,275
- We do?
- Mm..hm.

1196
01:19:09,375 --> 01:19:12,545
I made it yesterday.
First class. Real fancy.

1197
01:19:12,645 --> 01:19:14,080
Now, chop-chop.

1198
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:17,217
Upstairs. Get dressed.
Make a story up to Bean.

1199
01:19:17,317 --> 01:19:20,119
We've gotta get this road on the show. Eh?

1200
01:19:20,219 --> 01:19:22,219
Danny.

1201
01:20:57,617 --> 01:20:59,852
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1202
01:20:59,952 --> 01:21:01,321
I.. I..

1203
01:21:01,421 --> 01:21:02,422
I did it. I did it.

1204
01:21:02,522 --> 01:21:04,557
I did it, I leaned against that.

1205
01:21:04,657 --> 01:21:06,793
I was yawning,
and I apologize. I just..

1206
01:21:06,893 --> 01:21:10,488
Ah. Turn it off.

1207
01:21:10,563 --> 01:21:12,563
Sorry.

1208
01:21:28,181 --> 01:21:29,449
Bingo.

1209
01:23:40,613 --> 01:23:42,653
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1210
01:24:04,870 --> 01:24:06,870
Julian.

1211
01:24:07,473 --> 01:24:09,600
Hey. Julian.

1212
01:24:19,285 --> 01:24:21,285
Julian.

1213
01:24:24,390 --> 01:24:26,390
Julian.

1214
01:24:32,865 --> 01:24:34,865
Julian?

1215
01:24:36,402 --> 01:24:38,402
Hey.

1216
01:24:39,138 --> 01:24:41,474
What.. what the hell is going on?

1217
01:24:41,574 --> 01:24:43,574
Julian.

1218
01:24:47,013 --> 01:24:49,308
You drag me out to Arizona,

1219
01:24:50,116 --> 01:24:53,085
to the goddamn horse races.

1220
01:24:53,152 --> 01:24:55,152
To do this job, right?

1221
01:24:55,221 --> 01:24:58,026
To do this job,
this one last job.

1222
01:24:58,057 --> 01:25:00,693
To kill somebody that I don't even know..

1223
01:25:00,793 --> 01:25:03,930
so that you can live out
the rest of your life with Greeks..

1224
01:25:04,030 --> 01:25:07,767
'Beautiful little Greeks, Danny.'
We do.. I do everything perfectly.

1225
01:25:07,867 --> 01:25:09,335
Not you, me. Perfectly.

1226
01:25:09,435 --> 01:25:11,571
Did you see me, Julian?
I was brilliant.

1227
01:25:11,671 --> 01:25:13,839
You get a clean shot.
You had a clean shot,

1228
01:25:13,939 --> 01:25:15,975
and you don't take it?
What's going on?

1229
01:25:16,075 --> 01:25:17,577
I've lost it, Danny.

1230
01:25:17,677 --> 01:25:19,979
Oh, really?
Well, they're gonna kill you.

1231
01:25:20,079 --> 01:25:21,881
But I've lost it.

1232
01:25:21,981 --> 01:25:24,450
That.. that's an unacceptable answer.

1233
01:25:24,550 --> 01:25:27,100
- But it's the truth.
- Oh, jeez.

1234
01:25:27,119 --> 01:25:28,754
Hey. Hey.

1235
01:25:28,854 --> 01:25:30,913
Concentrate here, OK?

1236
01:25:30,990 --> 01:25:32,625
I need you to concentrate.

1237
01:25:32,725 --> 01:25:34,927
Just look at me, Danny,
look at me.

1238
01:25:35,027 --> 01:25:37,359
I'm a wreck. I'm a parody.

1239
01:25:37,430 --> 01:25:40,633
Julian, you gotta go up there
and finish this job.

1240
01:25:40,733 --> 01:25:42,535
No, no, just leave me alone.

1241
01:25:42,635 --> 01:25:44,670
Please, just forget everything.

1242
01:25:44,770 --> 01:25:47,106
I can't believe I'm in a stairwell..

1243
01:25:47,206 --> 01:25:50,309
trying to convince you
to assassinate somebody.

1244
01:25:50,409 --> 01:25:53,708
Just go. Just go, Danny.
Just go. Go.

1245
01:26:06,759 --> 01:26:07,860
No.

1246
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:10,053
No, we're gonna do this.

1247
01:26:11,430 --> 01:26:12,431
But I can't.

1248
01:26:12,531 --> 01:26:16,058
Julian, you have to.
Hey, you have to, OK?

1249
01:26:16,135 --> 01:26:18,971
If you don't, they're gonna kill you.
You understand?

1250
01:26:19,071 --> 01:26:20,406
- Yeah.
- You understand?

1251
01:26:20,506 --> 01:26:22,775
And I won't let that happen.

1252
01:26:22,875 --> 01:26:26,345
Huh? I refuse to let that happen.
How about that?

1253
01:26:26,445 --> 01:26:30,182
We're gonna go up there together,
I'm gonna talk you through it.

1254
01:26:30,282 --> 01:26:32,051
OK? I'm gonna talk you through it.

1255
01:26:32,151 --> 01:26:36,571
And you are gonna do the job
that you came to do. OK?

1256
01:26:36,655 --> 01:26:38,885
OK? All right?

1257
01:26:38,958 --> 01:26:41,051
- Huh? Huh?
- Yeah.

1258
01:26:41,127 --> 01:26:42,695
- OK.
- OK.

1259
01:26:42,795 --> 01:26:46,450
All right, up. Up, up, up, up.
There you go.

1260
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,969
- OK?
- You're gonna stay there with me?

1261
01:26:50,069 --> 01:26:51,303
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

1262
01:26:51,403 --> 01:26:54,974
- You're gonna talk me through it?
- That's right.

1263
01:26:55,074 --> 01:26:56,409
Thank you.

1264
01:26:56,509 --> 01:26:59,311
All right, let's go kill
this motherfucker already..

1265
01:26:59,411 --> 01:27:01,547
and get the hell out of here.

1266
01:27:01,647 --> 01:27:04,309
Go, Julian.

1267
01:27:04,383 --> 01:27:06,681
Yay.

1268
01:27:23,135 --> 01:27:25,135
Thank you.

1269
01:27:26,172 --> 01:27:28,800
No, really, I mean it.

1270
01:27:28,874 --> 01:27:30,967
I was a mess back there.

1271
01:27:31,977 --> 01:27:33,512
You helped me.

1272
01:27:33,612 --> 01:27:35,612
You helped me a lot.

1273
01:27:39,919 --> 01:27:42,354
I think I can handle the deviant Julian.

1274
01:27:42,454 --> 01:27:44,523
I can handle the lying Julian.

1275
01:27:44,623 --> 01:27:47,126
I can even handle the killing Julian.

1276
01:27:47,226 --> 01:27:50,796
I just don't know if I can
handle the humble pie Julian.

1277
01:27:53,232 --> 01:27:56,030
Well, enjoy it.
It won't last.

1278
01:27:56,101 --> 01:27:58,101
That's a given.

1279
01:28:02,041 --> 01:28:03,843
Really, it's..

1280
01:28:03,943 --> 01:28:06,002
no problem.

1281
01:28:07,379 --> 01:28:10,075
You said it yourself.

1282
01:28:10,149 --> 01:28:12,149
I owed you.

1283
01:28:13,586 --> 01:28:16,989
Do you think if you hadn't opened
the door that night in Mexico City..

1284
01:28:17,089 --> 01:28:21,424
the two of us would be
sitting on this plane now?

1285
01:28:23,062 --> 01:28:25,155
Probably not.

1286
01:28:28,901 --> 01:28:31,270
Come on,
I want to say I'm sorry.

1287
01:28:31,370 --> 01:28:34,206
I know it's late,
and I'm a little fucked up.

1288
01:28:34,306 --> 01:28:36,175
But I'm sorry.

1289
01:28:36,275 --> 01:28:39,108
Can't you see how guilty I feel?

1290
01:28:40,412 --> 01:28:42,047
Danny.

1291
01:28:42,147 --> 01:28:44,083
- Danny.
- Hold on, Julian.

1292
01:28:44,183 --> 01:28:46,183
I'm coming.

1293
01:28:50,356 --> 01:28:53,526
I don't know what I'll do
if I don't get this job.

1294
01:28:55,728 --> 01:28:59,799
And you're sure if I kill off this
Cardenas guy you'll get the contract?

1295
01:28:59,899 --> 01:29:02,231
He's our only competition.

1296
01:29:02,301 --> 01:29:04,769
And you can live with that?

1297
01:29:04,837 --> 01:29:06,438
Yeah.

1298
01:29:06,538 --> 01:29:10,448
You can live with
that blood on your hands, hm?

1299
01:29:10,843 --> 01:29:12,912
Isn't that what people do?

1300
01:29:13,012 --> 01:29:15,503
Don't people..

1301
01:29:16,515 --> 01:29:18,515
successful people..

1302
01:29:18,584 --> 01:29:22,069
always live with blood on their hands?

1303
01:29:25,157 --> 01:29:27,927
You became my friend
that night, Julian.

1304
01:29:28,027 --> 01:29:30,577
You became my lifelong friend.

1305
01:29:50,215 --> 01:29:53,343
I'm not gonna do it for you.

1306
01:29:53,419 --> 01:29:55,884
You're making a late night..

1307
01:29:55,921 --> 01:29:58,123
exhausted, desperate decision,

1308
01:29:58,223 --> 01:30:01,727
and if I did it,
you would regret it instantly..

1309
01:30:01,827 --> 01:30:03,996
and feel nothing but guilt and shame..

1310
01:30:04,096 --> 01:30:07,496
for the rest of your life,
believe me.

1311
01:30:08,100 --> 01:30:10,100
I'm so scared, Julian.

1312
01:30:11,637 --> 01:30:13,730
Guys like you..

1313
01:30:13,806 --> 01:30:15,941
you think you have no luck.

1314
01:30:16,041 --> 01:30:19,356
But you have all the luck in the world.

1315
01:30:19,912 --> 01:30:22,312
You just need to see it.

1316
01:30:22,381 --> 01:30:25,782
She's at home waiting for you.

1317
01:30:27,052 --> 01:30:28,821
If I did that job for you,

1318
01:30:28,921 --> 01:30:33,086
your luck would run bad
for the rest of your days.

1319
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:37,997
You don't want me to do it, anyway.
I know you don't.

1320
01:30:38,097 --> 01:30:40,732
You're not that type of person.

1321
01:30:42,368 --> 01:30:44,368
Hm.

1322
01:30:46,005 --> 01:30:48,337
That's why I like you.

1323
01:30:48,407 --> 01:30:52,062
You're the exact opposite of me.

1324
01:30:53,779 --> 01:30:55,581
Huh?

1325
01:30:55,681 --> 01:30:58,183
You surprised me that night.

1326
01:30:58,283 --> 01:31:01,013
I surprised myself.

1327
01:31:03,422 --> 01:31:05,257
Well..

1328
01:31:05,357 --> 01:31:08,160
I guess your boss
must be satisfied, right?

1329
01:31:08,260 --> 01:31:10,725
You completed the assignment,

1330
01:31:10,796 --> 01:31:13,060
no longer on the hit list.

1331
01:31:14,566 --> 01:31:16,802
Well, I'm no longer on the hit list,

1332
01:31:16,902 --> 01:31:19,537
but I didn't do any assignment.

1333
01:31:20,739 --> 01:31:22,739
I don't understand.

1334
01:31:22,775 --> 01:31:26,600
I thought your boss
wanted you to do this job.

1335
01:31:29,314 --> 01:31:31,050
My boss..

1336
01:31:31,150 --> 01:31:33,380
Mr. Stick..

1337
01:31:33,452 --> 01:31:35,477
he was the job.

1338
01:31:37,956 --> 01:31:39,291
You mean we just killed..

1339
01:31:39,391 --> 01:31:42,791
We killed the man who wanted to kill me.

1340
01:31:43,195 --> 01:31:45,195
Problem solved.

1341
01:31:49,802 --> 01:31:51,370
You..

1342
01:31:53,472 --> 01:31:56,066
You son of a bitch.

1343
01:31:56,141 --> 01:31:58,405
Among many other things.

1344
01:31:58,477 --> 01:32:01,080
- Don't ever hit me again.
- Sorry.

1345
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:27,100
