1
00:00:32,174 --> 00:00:37,294
Dilawar was a hard worker
and quiet.

2
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:42,934
A good man and honest.

3
00:00:43,614 --> 00:00:48,294
From small ...

4
00:00:48,454 --> 00:00:52,454
loved to drive tractors.

5
00:00:52,894 --> 00:00:56,174
He brought stones from the mountain.

6
00:00:56,254 --> 00:01:02,814
All stones of this wall.
Dilawar brought up here.

7
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:10,534
We are simple peasants,
but he said:

8
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:15,694
"Leave us to the field
and you see the taxi driver. "

9
00:01:48,454 --> 00:01:51,094
The first of December
2002 ...

10
00:01:51,174 --> 00:01:54,414
Dilawar, a young
Afghan taxi driver ...

11
00:01:54,534 --> 00:01:57,854
up to three passengers
for a trip.

12
00:02:01,734 --> 00:02:04,574
Never returned home.

Bagram AIR BASE,
AFGHANISTAN.

17
00:02:33,694 --> 00:02:35,854
When the sun
begins to hide ...

18
00:02:35,934 --> 00:02:39,414
the sand begins to blow,
as a large cloud of dust.

19
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:42,894
And I wonder
Is it well every night?

20
00:02:43,014 --> 00:02:46,254
I recall that when
first, the smell ...

21
00:02:46,414 --> 00:02:49,854
the smell is the first thing to note ...

22
00:02:49,934 --> 00:02:53,014
and being in Washington,
if you've been at the zoo ...

23
00:02:53,094 --> 00:02:56,214
when you enter
the cage of the elephant ...

24
00:02:56,254 --> 00:02:58,454
this is the best
way to describe it.

25
00:02:58,854 --> 00:03:02,614
A few lived in
prison and I was one of them.

26
00:03:02,694 --> 00:03:06,894
Bagram Prison.
It is a huge site built
to instill fear in detainees.

27
00:03:19,774 --> 00:03:22,014
After the invasion
to Afghanistan ...

28
00:03:22,014 --> 00:03:24,374
U.S. forces
occupied Bagram ...

29
00:03:24,494 --> 00:03:26,534
and an old air base
Soviet is the place ...

30
00:03:26,654 --> 00:03:29,454
to collect and interrogate
Thousands of detainees ...

31
00:03:29,574 --> 00:03:32,574
caught in
Afghanistan and Pakistan.

32
00:03:32,694 --> 00:03:35,614
Were suspected Taliban ...

33
00:03:35,774 --> 00:03:38,934
who had been trapped
by special forces ...

34
00:03:39,054 --> 00:03:42,734
in the field,
and brought to Bagram for ...

35
00:03:42,854 --> 00:03:45,294
questioning
and determine whether they were ...

36
00:03:45,414 --> 00:03:47,734
high-value prisoners.

37
00:03:48,054 --> 00:03:51,774
They were not good
people at all.

38
00:03:51,894 --> 00:03:53,934
They were very bad ...

39
00:03:54,054 --> 00:03:57,014
know, had
violent intentions.

40
00:03:57,534 --> 00:04:00,014
On December 5, 2002 ...

41
00:04:00,134 --> 00:04:04,014
Dilawar, a taxi driver,
was brought to Bagram.

42
00:04:04,134 --> 00:04:05,934
Was designated as a PUC. "

43
00:04:06,054 --> 00:04:09,134
Person under control,
number 421.

44
00:04:09,254 --> 00:04:13,694
Was related to
the rocket attack.

45
00:04:13,814 --> 00:04:17,894
That was all I knew.

46
00:04:18,134 --> 00:04:20,694
Five days after
their arrival ...

47
00:04:20,814 --> 00:04:23,094
was dead.

48
00:04:29,054 --> 00:04:34,374
I would say it was
as at 5:00 am ...

49
00:04:34,454 --> 00:04:37,254
and when passing
where Dilawar --

50
00:04:37,414 --> 00:04:40,174
I think it was called.
When passing by his cell ...

51
00:04:40,254 --> 00:04:43,934
he was there hanging
with his head down ...

52
00:04:44,054 --> 00:04:49,894
but it was very quiet for
be hanging there sleeping.

53
00:04:49,934 --> 00:04:53,294
Sergeant Curtis opened
the door and entered.

54
00:04:53,934 --> 00:04:57,534
Did not react. So we started
CPR.

55
00:04:57,614 --> 00:04:59,934
Was down
with other inmates ...

56
00:05:00,054 --> 00:05:03,614
and I heard it called
Cammack to raise ...

57
00:05:03,694 --> 00:05:09,134
was a nurse, and lower in
Cammack the stretcher and continued ...

58
00:05:09,214 --> 00:05:14,534
top of it trying to
while bajábamos resuscitate.

59
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:17,294
He was taken to the main door
and continued to work with him.

60
00:05:17,454 --> 00:05:20,694
To work until he reached the
physician and certified the death.

61
00:05:22,454 --> 00:05:26,134
Perhaps his injuries
were compounded by something ...

62
00:05:26,214 --> 00:05:29,374
or just got sick.

63
00:05:29,494 --> 00:05:31,774
It was a very fragile person.

64
00:05:31,894 --> 00:05:34,774
And I was surprised that
you take so long ...

65
00:05:34,894 --> 00:05:37,014
die under
our custody.

66
00:05:37,094 --> 00:05:41,894
There was concern
because it was the second.

67
00:05:41,934 --> 00:05:44,374
Just a week before
Dilawar's death ...

68
00:05:44,454 --> 00:05:47,094
another died
detained at Bagram.

69
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:50,054
Wondering if it will be
for something I did ...

70
00:05:50,174 --> 00:05:53,094
or if someone killed him,
I do not know say so.

71
00:05:53,214 --> 00:05:55,454
According to the coroner ...

72
00:05:55,574 --> 00:05:58,054
the first prisoner died,
Habibullah ...

73
00:05:58,174 --> 00:06:00,734
suffering from a disease
lung prior to his incarceration.

74
00:06:00,854 --> 00:06:03,494
But it was the beatings
received in Bagram ...

75
00:06:03,574 --> 00:06:05,854
what caused his death.

76
00:06:05,934 --> 00:06:09,094
A clot that was
lodged in the lungs.

77
00:06:09,174 --> 00:06:11,534
When he dies the second
a week later ...

78
00:06:11,654 --> 00:06:14,854
when we were scared.
Something will happen now.

79
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:19,534
Two prisoners die
in a week, that's bad.

80
00:06:19,654 --> 00:06:22,934
A preliminary investigation
Dilawar's death on ...

81
00:06:23,054 --> 00:06:26,494
revealed severe bruising
throughout your body.

82
00:06:26,574 --> 00:06:30,574
But not found that treatment
at Bagram has been the cause.

83
00:06:30,694 --> 00:06:33,694
Next day
I was told that ...

84
00:06:33,774 --> 00:06:36,934
how to draw remained
and when I was here ...

85
00:06:37,014 --> 00:06:39,294
this simple picture.

86
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:42,454
The roofs of these
Isolation rooms ...

87
00:06:42,534 --> 00:06:44,774
were simple metal railings ...

88
00:06:44,854 --> 00:06:50,014
and were sufficiently hard to
wives put through it ...

89
00:06:50,094 --> 00:06:54,454
to hang them so,
sideways.

90
00:06:56,934 --> 00:06:59,454
Long compulsory
periods of standing ...

91
00:06:59,574 --> 00:07:03,414
inflamed tissues injured
dents in Dilawar's legs.

92
00:07:03,774 --> 00:07:06,574
But the press release
Initial no mention ...

93
00:07:06,694 --> 00:07:08,774
wives or beating.

94
00:07:08,894 --> 00:07:13,334
They said that both arrested
died of natural causes.

95
00:07:19,494 --> 00:07:21,574
My opinion is ...

96
00:07:21,694 --> 00:07:24,214
that the military wanted ...

97
00:07:24,294 --> 00:07:26,974
Finally, finish
I quickly ...

98
00:07:27,094 --> 00:07:29,694
before calling the attention.

99
00:07:30,694 --> 00:07:32,854
Shortly after
Dilawar's death ...

100
00:07:32,934 --> 00:07:35,614
the official responsible for
interrogation in Bagram ...

101
00:07:35,694 --> 00:07:38,174
Captain Carolyn Wood
was awarded ...

102
00:07:38,254 --> 00:07:40,694
the Bronze Star to the value.

103
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,254
After the invasion of Iraq ...

104
00:07:43,374 --> 00:07:45,294
to Wood and his unit
Intelligence ...

105
00:07:45,414 --> 00:07:47,454
were given a new mission ...

106
00:07:48,054 --> 00:07:50,254
Abu Ghraib.

107
00:07:50,574 --> 00:07:55,454
A few
Rotten apple.

108
00:08:03,534 --> 00:08:07,654
My only memory
Abu Ghraib is the heat.

109
00:08:07,774 --> 00:08:12,174
It felt like 58 ° C there
and it was all concrete.

110
00:08:12,694 --> 00:08:16,054
Abu Ghraib was also
the infamous torture chambers ...

111
00:08:16,174 --> 00:08:18,774
and things were
from the time of Saddam.

112
00:08:19,094 --> 00:08:21,614
I remember having
visit and see ...

113
00:08:21,694 --> 00:08:25,374
as marks of nails
the walls, blood stains ...

114
00:08:25,454 --> 00:08:30,174
guillotines and the like.
An unreal feeling.

115
00:08:30,774 --> 00:08:36,014
We arrived at Abu Ghraib,
in July or August of 2003 ...

116
00:08:36,094 --> 00:08:39,214
to mount that prison.

117
00:08:41,174 --> 00:08:45,014
If you put the people in a situation
insane, commit follies.

118
00:08:46,214 --> 00:08:48,414
And Abu Ghraib received fire
mortars every night.

119
00:08:48,534 --> 00:08:51,534
120mm projectiles
who killed the prisoners.

120
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:56,374
When it was first
should evacuate to another location ...

121
00:08:56,454 --> 00:08:59,454
because they were not sure.

122
00:08:59,734 --> 00:09:03,654
We were told that we were
violent with those who resist.

123
00:09:03,734 --> 00:09:06,974
He also told us that
Those were the dogs.

124
00:09:07,094 --> 00:09:11,334
So suddenly you see these people
as something less than human ...

125
00:09:11,454 --> 00:09:14,294
and begin to make things
with which he never dreamed of.

126
00:09:14,374 --> 00:09:17,494
When there was
became dark.

127
00:09:24,494 --> 00:09:27,414
It was only the night shift.
There are always bad apples.

128
00:09:27,494 --> 00:09:29,654
It is a great coup
for all of us.

129
00:09:29,734 --> 00:09:32,454
It is clearly
an isolated incident.

130
00:09:32,574 --> 00:09:35,854
The conduct of a
very small group ...

131
00:09:35,934 --> 00:09:38,254
our officers and soldiers.

132
00:09:39,014 --> 00:09:42,254
Due to media attention
about Abu Ghraib ...

133
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:45,094
the army began
A number of investigations.

134
00:09:45,174 --> 00:09:48,934
The person conducting
abuses will be tried.

135
00:09:49,054 --> 00:09:53,014
The world will see a
free and democratic system ...

136
00:09:53,094 --> 00:09:56,414
works and operates
transparent ...

137
00:09:56,454 --> 00:09:58,734
without cover.

138
00:09:58,774 --> 00:10:00,614
The Secretary
and others will tell you ...

139
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:03,054
made
12 investigations.

140
00:10:03,134 --> 00:10:05,134
But each of them ...

141
00:10:05,254 --> 00:10:07,654
were made
to look down ...

142
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,134
Lynndie England to
Graner and ...

143
00:10:10,214 --> 00:10:12,334
and not upward.

144
00:10:15,094 --> 00:10:19,454
Soldiers of the photos,
PM or military police are ...

145
00:10:19,534 --> 00:10:23,294
whose mission was to guard
and protect the prisoners.

146
00:10:23,894 --> 00:10:28,294
In their statements, claimed
the Military Intelligence or MI ...

147
00:10:28,374 --> 00:10:32,014
had ordered them to humiliate
and weaken the prisoners ...

148
00:10:32,094 --> 00:10:34,454
as before
interrogation.

149
00:10:34,574 --> 00:10:37,174
Clearly what
made in these photos ...

150
00:10:37,254 --> 00:10:40,094
not endorsed by the rules
governing interrogations.

151
00:10:40,214 --> 00:10:44,614
So yes, I think
were bad apples.

152
00:10:44,734 --> 00:10:47,614
However, I also think
that still commands ...

153
00:10:47,774 --> 00:10:49,854
Intelligence Service.

154
00:10:49,934 --> 00:10:52,574
There were reports that
happening in Afghanistan ...

155
00:10:52,614 --> 00:10:55,094
I speak of the humiliation,
to demoralize the prisoners ...

156
00:10:55,214 --> 00:10:58,214
it all came from somewhere.
Not happened to the PMs.

157
00:10:58,254 --> 00:11:01,294
The PMs are not even
trained to do these things.

158
00:11:01,374 --> 00:11:04,734
Should have no
demoralized people.

159
00:11:05,494 --> 00:11:09,054
We use them in Abu
techniques at Bagram.

160
00:11:09,174 --> 00:11:11,734
Exactly the same rules.

161
00:11:12,614 --> 00:11:15,294
It happened the same.

162
00:11:17,054 --> 00:11:20,374
And they wonder why happened?

163
00:11:22,894 --> 00:11:25,814
In his affidavit
on Abu Ghraib ...

164
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:29,534
Wood said that the captain felt
pressure for the information.

165
00:11:29,614 --> 00:11:31,894
Thus techniques that led
Unauthorized:

166
00:11:32,014 --> 00:11:35,454
dogs, nakedness, deprivation
sleep and stress positions ...

167
00:11:35,614 --> 00:11:38,774
to Abu Ghraib
from Afghanistan.

168
00:11:38,894 --> 00:11:43,574
Maintained that the model of Bagram
had higher approval of ...

169
00:11:43,694 --> 00:11:46,294
but the U.S. Central Command
never replied ...

170
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:49,054
their applications.

171
00:11:49,174 --> 00:11:51,054
So the mystery remains ...

172
00:11:51,094 --> 00:11:54,294
Abu Ghraib Was the result
some bad apples?

173
00:11:54,454 --> 00:11:57,094
Or evidence of a new
Global ...

174
00:11:57,174 --> 00:12:00,814
detention and interrogation?

175
00:12:00,894 --> 00:12:03,734
Sure that the interrogators
I said to the guards:

176
00:12:03,854 --> 00:12:06,334
"Naked to this kind
espósenlo to bed ...

177
00:12:06,454 --> 00:12:09,134
in an awkward position
and do what they want. "

178
00:12:09,214 --> 00:12:11,934
And then decided
go a little further ...

179
00:12:12,054 --> 00:12:15,974
and have fun with it,
take some photos.

180
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:05,214
You always have to
military people ...

181
00:13:05,294 --> 00:13:07,974
are a step
the Marquis de Sade.

182
00:13:08,094 --> 00:13:10,614
And one reason why
which should have rules ...

183
00:13:10,694 --> 00:13:13,894
and this code of conduct
to help lead ...

184
00:13:14,014 --> 00:13:17,014
a number of soldiers
and marines ...

185
00:13:17,134 --> 00:13:20,134
is for you
use these tools ...

186
00:13:20,214 --> 00:13:24,214
to limit this
trend in your soldiers.

187
00:13:25,454 --> 00:13:28,414
When you have your friends
dying around you ...

188
00:13:28,534 --> 00:13:31,454
sometimes you can
go a little further.

189
00:13:31,534 --> 00:13:35,014
So a lieutenant, a captain
on the battlefield ...

190
00:13:35,094 --> 00:13:38,174
need these tools,
and be able to punish a. ..

191
00:13:38,254 --> 00:13:40,614
persons crossing the line.

192
00:13:40,774 --> 00:13:45,734
Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson
CHIEF OF STAFF Colin Powell.

193
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:51,414
When the secretary
came to my office ...

194
00:13:51,454 --> 00:13:55,014
at that time were
get out the photos from Abu Ghraib ...

195
00:13:55,094 --> 00:13:57,454
and there were rumors
that would ...

196
00:13:57,534 --> 00:14:00,894
I said: "I need to know
what happened and why. "

197
00:14:01,014 --> 00:14:04,414
Then I began to collect
both documents freely accessible ...

198
00:14:04,534 --> 00:14:08,414
and internal government,
classified or not.

199
00:14:08,534 --> 00:14:11,774
And I began to see arguments
legal because the President ...

200
00:14:11,774 --> 00:14:14,974
could do whatever he wanted
in the name of security.

201
00:14:15,094 --> 00:14:17,814
Both the Secretary of Defense
their junior ...

202
00:14:17,894 --> 00:14:19,894
were really looking for ...

203
00:14:20,014 --> 00:14:23,134
the same pressure that they
exercised over the people.

204
00:14:23,214 --> 00:14:25,734
The pressure to obtain
intelligence information ...

205
00:14:25,814 --> 00:14:29,094
and that said
had already removed the gloves.

206
00:14:29,214 --> 00:14:32,854
They created the environment
then we saw that reflected ...

207
00:14:32,934 --> 00:14:37,774
in the photos of Abu Ghraib,
and for me much more seriously ...

208
00:14:37,934 --> 00:14:43,694
these pictures that we saw,
are 98 deaths in custody ...

209
00:14:43,774 --> 00:14:45,774
From this interview,
105 DEATHS AND SON.

210
00:14:45,894 --> 00:14:50,854
and I learned by my colleagues
25 of them soldiers who ...

211
00:14:50,934 --> 00:14:53,734
have been officially declared
as homicides by the military.

212
00:14:53,774 --> 00:14:55,894
FROM THE INTERVIEW, 37 have been
SCHEDULED "homicide".

213
00:14:56,014 --> 00:14:58,414
Some would say that these
Abu Ghraib photos do not show ...

214
00:14:58,454 --> 00:15:02,334
real torture, I would
that murder is a torture.

215
00:15:02,414 --> 00:15:04,934
Murder is
supreme torture.

216
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:08,414
In the case of Dilawar,
He was ...

217
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:11,654
brutal punishment
and unusual ...

218
00:15:11,734 --> 00:15:16,094
and the final was
died because of torture.

219
00:15:23,654 --> 00:15:26,174
GRAL. Dan McNeill:
Our intention is not to kill ...

220
00:15:26,214 --> 00:15:30,894
especially if we
obtain information from them.

221
00:15:32,254 --> 00:15:37,614
GRAL. Dan McNeill,
Cmdte. The coalition.

222
00:15:39,774 --> 00:15:43,294
The treatment they received
in these cells ...

223
00:15:43,414 --> 00:15:46,454
caused the deaths
these two men?

224
00:15:46,574 --> 00:15:49,774
First, not chained to anyone
the roof, I had asked.

225
00:15:50,454 --> 00:15:54,774
"First, not chained to anyone
the ceiling, "that's what it says.

226
00:15:55,094 --> 00:15:59,094
Carlotta Gall, is a journalist
The New York Times in Kabul.

227
00:15:59,214 --> 00:16:01,894
Dissatisfied with the
explanation of the military ...

228
00:16:01,974 --> 00:16:05,894
the two deaths at Bagram,
undertook an investigation.

229
00:16:12,854 --> 00:16:15,134
It took me a long time
families to find ...

230
00:16:15,214 --> 00:16:17,934
because the military did not want
tell us where ...

231
00:16:18,014 --> 00:16:21,094
and began to call
the governors.

232
00:16:21,654 --> 00:16:25,174
They are a humble family
Farmers who do not speak English ...

233
00:16:25,214 --> 00:16:29,534
but showed me a paper
he got along with the body.

234
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:33,094
There was when I read it,
in English ...

235
00:16:33,254 --> 00:16:36,294
was a death certificate
the U.S. military.

236
00:16:36,414 --> 00:16:38,454
And it was signed by ...

237
00:16:38,614 --> 00:16:41,174
Enhanced U.S.
it was the pathologist.

238
00:16:41,254 --> 00:16:45,014
Of the four cells that had,
It marked the murder.

239
00:16:45,094 --> 00:16:46,454
MURDER.

240
00:16:46,574 --> 00:16:48,894
I said:
"My God, they killed him."

241
00:16:49,014 --> 00:16:51,174
Then we had to ask
the family if they knew ...

242
00:16:51,254 --> 00:16:53,614
what was written here.
They told us:

243
00:16:53,694 --> 00:16:55,614
"No, it is in English.
I do not understand. "

244
00:16:55,694 --> 00:16:59,214
And I think that perhaps the Red Cross
helped restore the body ...

245
00:16:59,294 --> 00:17:02,334
had been explained,
but I do not understand.

246
00:17:02,574 --> 00:17:04,894
And then the pathologist said ...

247
00:17:04,974 --> 00:17:08,494
who had injuries
contusions on his legs.

248
00:17:08,574 --> 00:17:12,454
Did you suffer any trauma?

249
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:15,774
Any trauma by
contusion that is how his name?

250
00:17:15,894 --> 00:17:18,294
At the moment I have no
evidence that ...

251
00:17:18,414 --> 00:17:23,614
but we will review as
that the investigation continues.

252
00:17:23,774 --> 00:17:27,054
"At the moment no
I have evidence of that. "

253
00:17:27,134 --> 00:17:32,534
There is a signed certificate
for their people, and he says:

254
00:17:32,934 --> 00:17:35,734
"At the moment I have no evidence
any injury by contusion.

255
00:17:35,774 --> 00:17:38,934
And that is on the certificate
death, I saw him.

256
00:17:39,094 --> 00:17:41,854
The story would have disappeared
if not for my fellow ...

257
00:17:41,934 --> 00:17:45,694
Carlotta Gall. She found
Dilawar's family ...

258
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:51,414
and gave the track
showed that all ...

259
00:17:51,454 --> 00:17:53,934
that this incident was
something completely different ...

260
00:17:54,054 --> 00:17:56,054
what the army said.

261
00:17:56,854 --> 00:17:59,534
Tim Golden continued
track of the story ...

262
00:17:59,614 --> 00:18:01,934
and obtained a record
confidentiality of the investigation ...

263
00:18:02,054 --> 00:18:05,334
army, including hundreds
pages of testimony ...

264
00:18:05,454 --> 00:18:07,734
of the soldiers involved.

265
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:09,854
One of the things that
caught my attention ...

266
00:18:09,974 --> 00:18:12,494
was that you were young
soldiers with very little ...

267
00:18:12,614 --> 00:18:16,934
training and preparation,
mired in the middle of a hangover 11 / 9 ...

268
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,054
precisely when
the rules were changing ...

269
00:18:19,134 --> 00:18:21,454
without having such
what they sought.

270
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:24,854
And you have this young Afghan
entered the system ...

271
00:18:24,934 --> 00:18:27,214
at the wrong time
in all the wrong ...

272
00:18:27,374 --> 00:18:29,534
and this was what happened.

273
00:18:29,614 --> 00:18:32,294
I saw his picture in the New York Times.

274
00:18:32,414 --> 00:18:35,694
Before you look at that picture
would not have acknowledged.

275
00:18:35,774 --> 00:18:38,454
My memories of him are ...

276
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:42,614
chained with the hood
lay, sleepless.

277
00:18:43,374 --> 00:18:46,774
After the questions
raised by the New York Times ...

278
00:18:46,854 --> 00:18:49,374
and under the scrutiny of
Abu Ghraib scandal ...

279
00:18:49,454 --> 00:18:53,014
the army finally accelerated
Dilawar investigation of the case ...

280
00:18:53,094 --> 00:18:56,614
and began to accuse
soldiers abuse ...

281
00:18:56,734 --> 00:18:59,254
mutilation and murder.

282
00:18:59,414 --> 00:19:02,534
When you work with a
organization like the army ...

283
00:19:02,614 --> 00:19:06,254
always blaming someone.
You can hide some things ...

284
00:19:06,334 --> 00:19:09,334
but it was a death.
Were two deaths.

285
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:11,534
Well, it is logical
to accuse people.

286
00:19:11,654 --> 00:19:15,694
It seemed that the army after
Abu Ghraib hit ...

287
00:19:15,774 --> 00:19:18,734
wanted the opinion
public to see that ...

288
00:19:18,854 --> 00:19:21,214
take action
regard to its soldiers.

289
00:19:21,374 --> 00:19:24,934
So I said: "We have this
incident two years ago ...

290
00:19:25,014 --> 00:19:27,734
yet we can process
some of them. "

291
00:19:28,214 --> 00:19:30,694
Two years ago that I do not have
relationship with the army ...

292
00:19:30,774 --> 00:19:34,094
and suddenly I hear
I will make a court martial.

293
00:19:34,254 --> 00:19:36,934
That was a great
surprise to me.

294
00:19:37,014 --> 00:19:39,574
From the standpoint of
defense immediately said ...

295
00:19:39,694 --> 00:19:41,894
this was
a political spectacle.

296
00:19:41,934 --> 00:19:44,014
Willie Brand is a good soldier ...

297
00:19:44,094 --> 00:19:46,094
Good Soldiers
follow orders ...

298
00:19:46,174 --> 00:19:48,254
Good Soldiers
are people who ...

299
00:19:48,414 --> 00:19:50,894
what to do with
who were trained.

300
00:19:50,934 --> 00:19:53,294
Interrogators
on the ground ...

301
00:19:53,414 --> 00:19:55,614
almost all of them did not know
which were the rules.

302
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,734
They had never questioned before.

303
00:19:57,854 --> 00:20:01,974
My training
question was ...

304
00:20:01,974 --> 00:20:04,574
Basic Education
how to go ...

305
00:20:04,694 --> 00:20:06,654
how to make
people to talk.

306
00:20:06,774 --> 00:20:10,174
And then they took us to
see interrogations ...

307
00:20:10,254 --> 00:20:13,094
of the types for which
We were going to replace ...

308
00:20:13,214 --> 00:20:15,614
by about five or six hours ...

309
00:20:15,694 --> 00:20:18,174
before making
my first interrogation.

310
00:20:18,294 --> 00:20:20,774
Damien was chosen for this
work because it's big ...

311
00:20:20,894 --> 00:20:23,374
speaks loud and scared.

312
00:20:23,454 --> 00:20:25,494
That was his qualification.

313
00:20:25,574 --> 00:20:28,614
"Soldiers are dying,
get information. "

314
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:31,614
It is the only thing you said:
"Get Info".

315
00:20:32,254 --> 00:20:34,774
The soldiers say that when
prisoners arrived ...

316
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:38,534
as Dilawar at Bagram,
were attacked immediately.

317
00:20:39,254 --> 00:20:40,934
Shock
Of the catch.

318
00:20:41,094 --> 00:20:43,454
I put music
at full volume ...

319
00:20:43,574 --> 00:20:46,174
often thrown
over barking dogs ...

320
00:20:46,254 --> 00:20:50,014
and used some of
the most threatening ...

321
00:20:50,094 --> 00:20:53,934
interrogators to
create a sense of danger.

322
00:20:54,014 --> 00:20:56,614
One of them was Damien Corsetti.

323
00:20:56,734 --> 00:20:59,094
With the hood trying to
giving what we call ...

324
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:01,494
"the shock of capture."
When the person comes ...

325
00:21:01,574 --> 00:21:04,094
is the best time to
achieve information because ...

326
00:21:04,214 --> 00:21:06,534
is frightened,
wondering what happens.

327
00:21:06,614 --> 00:21:08,654
The procedure is not
limited to mislead ...

328
00:21:08,774 --> 00:21:11,294
but also to terrorize.
It is designed to ...

329
00:21:11,414 --> 00:21:14,254
cause terror and make
speak, so to speak.

330
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:17,454
I spit, insult,
barking dogs around you ...

331
00:21:17,574 --> 00:21:19,574
you shoot flash
front of the face.

332
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:22,174
Please note that
the dog in their culture ...

333
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:24,774
is more afraid than in ours.

334
00:21:24,854 --> 00:21:27,214
It's almost as if a woman
tell them what to do.

335
00:21:27,374 --> 00:21:31,294
It is a cultural issue.
Using dogs is successful.

336
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:34,094
Then you immobilized
completely naked ...

337
00:21:34,174 --> 00:21:37,174
to make what they call
Register corporal ...

338
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:39,534
registering cavities.

339
00:21:39,614 --> 00:21:43,214
After you interrogate
naked titiritando.

340
00:21:45,854 --> 00:21:47,894
After reading
rules and other ...

341
00:21:47,934 --> 00:21:51,934
are brought to their cells,
and are prevented from sleeping for 24 hours.

342
00:21:52,054 --> 00:21:54,174
That is all.

343
00:21:54,254 --> 00:21:56,294
From there the
Military Intelligence says if ...

344
00:21:56,454 --> 00:21:59,214
can go with the other defendants
or whether they were still in isolation.

345
00:21:59,294 --> 00:22:04,174
And if still isolated
if you are able to sleep and when.

346
00:22:04,294 --> 00:22:06,614
To weaken detainees ...

347
00:22:06,734 --> 00:22:09,174
interrogators ordered
the military police to ...

348
00:22:09,254 --> 00:22:11,694
find new ways to
sleep to prevent the prisoners.

349
00:22:11,774 --> 00:22:14,614
You are in that room
without saying anything ...

350
00:22:14,734 --> 00:22:17,374
good and think that maybe
knows anything more, we a. ..

351
00:22:17,454 --> 00:22:19,934
know, to deprive
something more than dream.

352
00:22:20,014 --> 00:22:22,614
That was the idea
keep them that way.

353
00:22:22,694 --> 00:22:24,974
Why not sleep well,
're standing ...

354
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:27,414
as in
begin to fall asleep ...

355
00:22:27,534 --> 00:22:32,094
feel the pressure
wrists and arms.

356
00:22:33,454 --> 00:22:36,694
The only time the police
military help has reached us ...

357
00:22:36,774 --> 00:22:39,054
was to keep
at the time of sleep.

358
00:22:39,094 --> 00:22:42,734
Gave them some time to sleep.
Was that time continue?

359
00:22:42,854 --> 00:22:46,774
With interruptions?
In periods of 15 minutes?

360
00:22:46,854 --> 00:22:51,614
Who knows?
That was our goal.

361
00:22:52,774 --> 00:22:56,454
Upon entering the room,
had a blackboard on the wall.

362
00:22:56,574 --> 00:23:00,174
You could see an arrow pointing
upwards towards the ceiling y. ..

363
00:23:00,294 --> 00:23:05,014
and perhaps one at his side a,
That meant an hour's walk.

364
00:23:05,094 --> 00:23:06,894
Should be awake
for an hour.

365
00:23:07,014 --> 00:23:10,734
Then one could see two
with an arrow.

366
00:23:10,854 --> 00:23:13,574
That meant he could
spend two hours sitting.

367
00:23:13,694 --> 00:23:16,774
The prisoners were kept
pens in these great ...

368
00:23:16,894 --> 00:23:20,814
and had his number written in
the ventilation duct ...

369
00:23:20,894 --> 00:23:23,734
it was a small opening
by which they got ...

370
00:23:23,854 --> 00:23:27,454
to raise the
isolation cells.

371
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:31,214
The detainees were shackled
with your hands above your head ...

372
00:23:31,294 --> 00:23:35,854
in these ducts, their number
I saw the 421 with frequency ...

373
00:23:35,934 --> 00:23:38,574
because his head was just
in front of me in that line.

374
00:23:38,694 --> 00:23:41,694
The numbers were written
on the back of the prisoners.

375
00:23:41,774 --> 00:23:44,454
And we were all
front, too.

376
00:23:45,214 --> 00:23:47,854
At Bagram
my number was 180 ...

377
00:23:47,934 --> 00:23:51,014
but then I
changed by 558.

378
00:23:51,894 --> 00:23:56,014
Thank you. It is a pleasure to be
with you here at Bagram.

379
00:23:56,094 --> 00:23:58,774
GRAL. VISIT FRANKS Bagram.
I am sure that any
authority to visit us ...

380
00:23:58,894 --> 00:24:00,934
saw the shackles ...

381
00:24:01,054 --> 00:24:02,854
because you come visit to look ...

382
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:05,694
RUMSFELD VISITS Bagram.
are curious as
around the world.

383
00:24:05,774 --> 00:24:10,054
Authorities must always
visited.

384
00:24:10,174 --> 00:24:13,494
Bromeábamos saying that
was the largest show of the world.

385
00:24:13,614 --> 00:24:16,694
Everybody wanted to come
to see the terrorists.

386
00:24:16,774 --> 00:24:21,214
We are often called
the office of Mr. Rumsfeld.

387
00:24:21,294 --> 00:24:25,934
GRAL. McNeill VISIT Bagram.
Senior commanders
wanted to learn every day ...

388
00:24:26,054 --> 00:24:27,854
on certain prisoners.

389
00:24:27,974 --> 00:24:31,734
They knew, saw
Shackled, hooded ...

390
00:24:31,814 --> 00:24:34,614
told us: "Come
they do very well. "

391
00:24:34,774 --> 00:24:37,214
When the Red Cross
visited Bagram ...

392
00:24:37,294 --> 00:24:39,774
Slate on time
of sleep deprivation was erased ...

393
00:24:39,934 --> 00:24:42,254
and the prisoners were
removing the shackles.

394
00:24:42,374 --> 00:24:45,174
The military procedure
Traditional does not allow you to ...

395
00:24:45,254 --> 00:24:47,934
shackling
people with fixed objects.

396
00:24:48,094 --> 00:24:51,734
And certainly not with
arms over your head.

397
00:24:51,774 --> 00:24:54,934
At first got a
handcuffed to the people ...

398
00:24:55,054 --> 00:24:58,254
ventilation ducts
the cells to punish them.

399
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:01,254
And that was strictly
limited to 15 minutes ...

400
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:04,054
half hour
but soon escalated ...

401
00:25:04,174 --> 00:25:06,334
When they entered, and there ...

402
00:25:06,454 --> 00:25:10,014
had a pair
long wives ...

403
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:13,414
hanging from the wires
the mesh roof.

404
00:25:13,534 --> 00:25:16,614
Ready for any
arrived.

405
00:25:19,494 --> 00:25:23,374
The cause of death.

406
00:25:25,454 --> 00:25:30,414
CAUSE OF DEATH: HOMICIDE.

407
00:25:31,174 --> 00:25:33,734
The coroner's army
Dilawar who discussed ...

408
00:25:33,854 --> 00:25:36,894
discovered tissue damage
mass in the legs.

409
00:25:37,014 --> 00:25:41,854
Later testify that
his legs had been crushed.

410
00:25:42,454 --> 00:25:45,534
What could cause
that kind of damage?

411
00:25:45,614 --> 00:25:48,534
CORONEL HAYDEN:
This is not a hotel,
is not a place ...

412
00:25:48,614 --> 00:25:51,614
to laze
fat and happy.

413
00:25:51,734 --> 00:25:55,854
In a video that appeared in the
course of the investigation ...

414
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,894
Colonel David Hayden,
the most important lawyer ...

415
00:25:58,934 --> 00:26:01,094
of U.S. forces
in Afghanistan ...

416
00:26:01,174 --> 00:26:05,334
describes the policy of restraining
and beat the detainees.

417
00:26:05,454 --> 00:26:07,814
Had approved a technical
for military police ...

418
00:26:07,934 --> 00:26:10,854
hit in the legs
troublesome prisoners.

419
00:26:10,974 --> 00:26:14,294
In theory considered
nonfatal strokes.

420
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:17,294
Never really heard
say no to top:

421
00:26:17,414 --> 00:26:20,294
"Give them kicked in the legs
if they do this or that. "

422
00:26:20,414 --> 00:26:23,374
What we said was
that this was an option ...

423
00:26:23,454 --> 00:26:26,414
to which we could
use to control them.

424
00:26:26,534 --> 00:26:30,014
It was just beaten
with the knee in the ...

425
00:26:30,134 --> 00:26:33,414
upper thigh.
It was assumed that this ...

426
00:26:33,534 --> 00:26:37,774
was a pressure point
to control them easily.

427
00:26:38,374 --> 00:26:41,054
If you hit the legs
for more than two days ...

428
00:26:41,094 --> 00:26:43,614
can cause
serious problems.

429
00:26:43,734 --> 00:26:47,294
Throughout the investigation,
and even in trials ...

430
00:26:47,414 --> 00:26:49,894
Several of the guards
and interrogators ...

431
00:26:49,934 --> 00:26:53,054
described as Dilawar
a very combative prisoner ...

432
00:26:53,094 --> 00:26:55,614
of strong character.

433
00:26:55,694 --> 00:26:58,934
But that never
is compatible with ...

434
00:26:59,054 --> 00:27:02,374
other evidence
that this man had.

435
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:05,454
He weighed 55 pounds when he died.

436
00:27:05,974 --> 00:27:09,934
The passengers of the taxi
Dilawar told us to ...

437
00:27:10,014 --> 00:27:12,934
he was absolutely
terrified at Bagram.

438
00:27:13,054 --> 00:27:16,534
That through the walls
Isolation of the cell ...

439
00:27:16,654 --> 00:27:19,494
they had heard yelling calling
his father and his mother.

440
00:27:21,414 --> 00:27:24,814
I was in a position
very uncomfortable, sputter ...

441
00:27:24,894 --> 00:27:27,294
sometimes praying,
others for help.

442
00:27:27,414 --> 00:27:32,054
Or at least it seemed to me asking
help because they did not understand their language.

443
00:27:32,534 --> 00:27:36,454
Several witnesses recall the night
Prior to the deaths of Dilawar.

444
00:27:36,774 --> 00:27:40,934
Only that night gave
the best 10 in the kicking leg.

445
00:27:41,014 --> 00:27:43,454
Some soldiers told
who gave knees ...

446
00:27:43,534 --> 00:27:46,894
only silence,
because it did not stop shout.

447
00:27:46,934 --> 00:27:48,934
The damage was done.

448
00:27:49,014 --> 00:27:51,294
Their injuries were caused
multiple strokes, y. ..

449
00:27:51,414 --> 00:27:54,454
many of them could have been
avoided having known ...

450
00:27:54,574 --> 00:27:58,774
that the person who had gone before,
used the same technique with him.

451
00:28:00,454 --> 00:28:03,814
When they finally reached
move to an isolation cell ...

452
00:28:03,934 --> 00:28:06,294
I think it was
body devastated.

453
00:28:06,694 --> 00:28:09,054
One reason for
why do we beat ...

454
00:28:09,134 --> 00:28:11,814
it is believed that
was faking.

455
00:28:12,414 --> 00:28:16,654
Was standing in the conduit
ventilation hooded.

456
00:28:16,774 --> 00:28:21,774
His hands were above
of the head and complained.

457
00:28:21,854 --> 00:28:25,174
Began to resist in
the duct.

458
00:28:25,214 --> 00:28:28,374
The conduit has an entry
front and rear ...

459
00:28:28,494 --> 00:28:31,054
but on both sides
There is barbed wire.

460
00:28:31,174 --> 00:28:34,934
None of us wanted
get into the barbed wire ...

461
00:28:35,174 --> 00:28:38,014
so I took the duct ...

462
00:28:38,094 --> 00:28:40,614
it lying on the ground
and immobilized.

463
00:28:40,734 --> 00:28:43,614
What kind of force had
be used for submission?

464
00:28:43,694 --> 00:28:46,374
Physical strength, he was beaten.

465
00:28:47,014 --> 00:28:49,414
There were four policemen
military with him.

466
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:54,014
And one of the PMs not stop
give blows to the kidneys.

467
00:28:54,094 --> 00:28:57,774
The other two
threw it to the ground ...

468
00:28:57,934 --> 00:29:01,054
and the fourth was
climbed into the back.

469
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:04,614
He had a huge cut on his nose.

470
00:29:04,694 --> 00:29:08,494
There was no reason to beat him,
remember that he was handcuffed.

471
00:29:08,614 --> 00:29:10,694
Even when controlling
was not a problem ...

472
00:29:10,814 --> 00:29:14,014
eventually exceeded
to be enforced.

473
00:29:14,094 --> 00:29:16,214
And possibly
it looked a mess.

474
00:29:16,294 --> 00:29:19,614
Because the truth is
which could not be ...

475
00:29:19,734 --> 00:29:22,894
kicking a man while
he was chained.

476
00:29:24,574 --> 00:29:27,174
Dilawar was taken to
cell isolation ...

477
00:29:27,294 --> 00:29:29,694
where they continued
giving knees.

478
00:29:30,214 --> 00:29:33,414
In his appearance before the Tribunal,
The coroner said the army ...

479
00:29:33,534 --> 00:29:37,534
it seemed as if a bus
had passed over his legs ...

480
00:29:37,614 --> 00:29:42,934
and which have survived
would have required amputations.

481
00:29:43,054 --> 00:29:45,934
Then came the question:
Is this what you did?

482
00:29:46,094 --> 00:29:51,774
Not that I did or what made him
or what he did either ...

483
00:29:51,854 --> 00:29:54,254
but what you have done.

484
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:58,174
Now it is almost incomprehensible.

485
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:03,894
There were soldiers like Willie Brand,
that seems kind of soft voice ...

486
00:30:04,014 --> 00:30:08,734
but testified that struck many
times in the legs to Dilawar ...

487
00:30:08,814 --> 00:30:12,174
being tired knee
and had to switch to the other.

488
00:30:13,134 --> 00:30:17,414
Sometimes I think we should have ...

489
00:30:17,534 --> 00:30:21,974
continued my
moral principles ...

490
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:25,214
instead of
practices.

491
00:30:27,374 --> 00:30:30,854
A military policeman said that
acquired the habit of ...

492
00:30:30,934 --> 00:30:34,374
entertain inflicting knees
Dilawar only to hear you scream.

493
00:30:34,454 --> 00:30:37,534
Some would say, "Hey, you should
have stopped that ...

494
00:30:37,614 --> 00:30:41,374
to see who was wounded,
you kicked.

495
00:30:41,454 --> 00:30:44,054
Why not do something. "
Very good question.

496
00:30:44,094 --> 00:30:46,374
My answer would be:
"We were against us there."

497
00:30:46,454 --> 00:30:49,294
I was there and not
I wanted to look like that ...

498
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:52,454
I returned to my
fellow militia.

499
00:30:53,094 --> 00:30:57,934
Is that wrong? Sit
here and say it's wrong ...

500
00:30:58,094 --> 00:31:00,214
go there and say it.

501
00:31:03,814 --> 00:31:07,574
No one inquired about who
established standards in Bagram.

502
00:31:08,614 --> 00:31:11,214
The researchers will never
Wood asked the Captain ...

503
00:31:11,334 --> 00:31:14,174
What high-ranking officers
had been authorized to use ...

504
00:31:14,294 --> 00:31:18,574
techniques prohibited by
the rules of the army?

505
00:31:19,214 --> 00:31:21,894
Captain Beiring
of the Military Police ...

506
00:31:21,974 --> 00:31:24,214
was the only official
charged in the case.

507
00:31:24,294 --> 00:31:27,094
Responsible for negligence
was dismissed ...

508
00:31:27,214 --> 00:31:30,014
where the judge ruled
no one had ...

509
00:31:30,094 --> 00:31:33,214
defined what the
Captain Beiring duties.

510
00:31:33,854 --> 00:31:36,534
Despite repeated requests
an instruction ...

511
00:31:36,614 --> 00:31:38,894
and standards of performance
for his soldiers ...

512
00:31:39,014 --> 00:31:41,374
superiors
they are never hit.

513
00:31:41,454 --> 00:31:44,694
We are all concerned about lack
guidelines written ...

514
00:31:44,774 --> 00:31:48,414
but we are reassured
saying they were coming.

515
00:31:48,894 --> 00:31:51,574
We knew perfectly well why
they gave no clear rules ...

516
00:31:51,694 --> 00:31:54,414
if something happened.

517
00:31:54,694 --> 00:31:57,574
If I had to do it again
certainly would say no.

518
00:31:58,614 --> 00:32:03,814
That I will not do anything
to see something in writing.

519
00:32:04,254 --> 00:32:08,934
And recalling, ¿cree
they were poorly informed?

520
00:32:10,614 --> 00:32:14,054
I believe we all were.

521
00:32:18,614 --> 00:32:23,694
CHANGING THE RULES.

522
00:32:42,094 --> 00:32:47,014
A week after 9 / 11,
Vice President Dick Cheney ...

523
00:32:47,094 --> 00:32:49,414
appeared in the program
"Meet the Press" ...

524
00:32:49,454 --> 00:32:54,774
to ensure that practices
iban interrogation to change.

525
00:32:54,894 --> 00:32:56,254
Revenge.

526
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:58,294
We must work
on the dark side ...

527
00:32:58,414 --> 00:33:02,494
will be in the
shadow information.

528
00:33:02,894 --> 00:33:06,494
Much of what needs to be done,
should be conducted in silence ...

529
00:33:06,614 --> 00:33:08,814
without discussions,
using sources and methods ...

530
00:33:08,894 --> 00:33:12,094
available for our
Intelligence Agencies ...

531
00:33:12,214 --> 00:33:16,094
if we are to succeed.
So they operate.

532
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:21,054
And it will be vital for us to use
all means at our disposal ...

533
00:33:21,134 --> 00:33:23,294
to achieve our goals.

534
00:33:23,654 --> 00:33:27,734
It's been said that everything starts at
Vice President Cheney's office ...

535
00:33:27,854 --> 00:33:33,534
fully convinced
that we were not so aggressive ...

536
00:33:33,614 --> 00:33:38,214
in interrogations as
could or should.

537
00:33:38,254 --> 00:33:39,894
SCOTT HORTON, EXPERT
IN INTERNATIONAL LAW.

538
00:33:40,014 --> 00:33:43,214
Had to be tough
with detainees.

539
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:46,934
If Dick Cheney was the architect
first of a new policy ...

540
00:33:47,054 --> 00:33:49,774
John Yoo was the
principal draftsman.

541
00:33:49,934 --> 00:33:53,574
With a guiding purpose,
advocated a more flexible ...

542
00:33:53,694 --> 00:33:56,094
to deal with
suspected terrorists.

543
00:33:56,294 --> 00:34:00,054
Former United States considered
terrorism a criminal problem ...

544
00:34:00,174 --> 00:34:03,334
the attacks of 9 / 11 showed
that the fight against Al Qaeda ...

545
00:34:03,454 --> 00:34:04,654
had been transformed
in a war.

546
00:34:04,734 --> 00:34:08,054
And I think that when an entity
foreign policy objectives ...

547
00:34:08,174 --> 00:34:10,934
kills 3,000 Americans,
causing billions ...

548
00:34:11,014 --> 00:34:15,574
dollars in damages and seeks to
eliminate the U.S. government ...

549
00:34:15,974 --> 00:34:19,174
to most people because it
looks like a war, not a crime.

550
00:34:19,734 --> 00:34:22,854
President Bush declared
the war on terror.

551
00:34:22,934 --> 00:34:26,574
But that raised the question of whether
suspected terrorists should be ...

552
00:34:26,654 --> 00:34:28,734
covered by the
laws of war ...

553
00:34:28,854 --> 00:34:31,294
prepared by
Geneva Convention.

554
00:34:32,894 --> 00:34:35,254
The atrocities of war
that shocked the world ...

555
00:34:35,414 --> 00:34:37,854
led to the
Geneva Convention.

556
00:34:38,214 --> 00:34:41,574
The purpose of the Treaty
International was to provide protection ...

557
00:34:41,614 --> 00:34:45,614
basic to any human being
caught in a war.

558
00:34:46,694 --> 00:34:49,614
Indeed, over 50 years,
Geneva Convention offered ...

559
00:34:49,734 --> 00:34:53,934
under legal and prohibited the
Interrogators used torture ...

560
00:34:54,054 --> 00:34:59,094
and even murder
humiliating and degrading treatment.

561
00:34:59,774 --> 00:35:03,654
After 9 / 11, John Yoo worked
the office of Dick Cheney ...

562
00:35:03,774 --> 00:35:07,214
and Alberto Gonzales,
Adviser to the President.

563
00:35:07,374 --> 00:35:09,774
Together, they drafted a series of
reported that argued ...

564
00:35:09,854 --> 00:35:14,374
that the Geneva Convention does not
protecting suspected terrorists.

565
00:35:14,694 --> 00:35:18,614
And gave legal cover to
that the CIA and Special Forces ...

566
00:35:18,734 --> 00:35:21,214
embarked on a
hidden agenda ...

567
00:35:21,294 --> 00:35:24,614
using methods of interrogation
banned so far.

568
00:35:24,934 --> 00:35:28,894
Have arrested more than 3000
suspected terrorists in many countries.

569
00:35:29,054 --> 00:35:31,454
Many were
a different destination.

570
00:35:32,054 --> 00:35:33,774
Pongámoslo well ...

571
00:35:33,854 --> 00:35:38,294
are no longer a problem either for the
U.S. or our allies.

572
00:35:43,094 --> 00:35:45,734
The problem of the president,
Gonzales said as ...

573
00:35:45,774 --> 00:35:48,454
was that some of the new
interrogation techniques ...

574
00:35:48,534 --> 00:35:51,774
were proscribed by the laws
U.S. and international.

575
00:35:51,894 --> 00:35:54,254
Said one of its arguments:

576
00:35:54,294 --> 00:35:57,694
"We do not want to apply
the Geneva Convention. "

577
00:35:58,254 --> 00:36:02,214
"Because if it does, it can
constitute war crimes. "

578
00:36:02,294 --> 00:36:03,814
Admiral (Ret.) JOHN HUDSON,
FORMER MILITARY JUDGE.

579
00:36:03,934 --> 00:36:07,174
It is well known principle
of command responsibility.

580
00:36:07,294 --> 00:36:10,454
It was established in the trials of
Nuremberg after World War II.

581
00:36:10,574 --> 00:36:13,214
And instituted the principles of
international criminal law.

582
00:36:13,334 --> 00:36:14,814
ALBERTO MORA, EX-PROSECUTOR
MILITARY LA MARINA.

583
00:36:14,934 --> 00:36:16,854
Where to order
treatment illegal ...

584
00:36:16,934 --> 00:36:19,214
be held responsible
of this treatment but no ...

585
00:36:19,294 --> 00:36:22,414
they are violations
personally this abuse.

586
00:36:24,694 --> 00:36:26,894
To avoid the
interrogation practices ...

587
00:36:27,014 --> 00:36:29,494
U.S.
struck out with torture ...

588
00:36:29,614 --> 00:36:31,894
John Yoo worked in the
drafting a memorandum of ...

589
00:36:31,974 --> 00:36:34,454
devoted to clarifying the
meaning of the term.

590
00:36:34,534 --> 00:36:41,174
Prohibits only extreme acts,
ie, serious physical injury ...

591
00:36:41,254 --> 00:36:46,054
damage to organs or functions
body, or even death.

592
00:36:46,094 --> 00:36:49,454
And that says a legal document,
the Memorandum of Torture. "

593
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:53,934
Was a
dubious law.

594
00:36:54,054 --> 00:36:59,294
We discussed and finally
was accepted as representative --

595
00:36:59,454 --> 00:37:04,054
It was the decision and final position
the Office of Legal Counsel.

596
00:37:06,454 --> 00:37:09,894
The memo from the Office of Counsel
Imposed no legal restrictions.

597
00:37:10,014 --> 00:37:13,134
That is, at any time
stated that the application ...

598
00:37:13,254 --> 00:37:16,214
of inhuman treatment and
degrading prohibited.

599
00:37:16,294 --> 00:37:18,054
And at one point,
I asked John Yoo ...

600
00:37:18,134 --> 00:37:23,294
if the president could authorize
torture, and his answer was yes.

601
00:37:23,414 --> 00:37:27,814
I think the lawyer should tell the
People come what laws and what not ...

602
00:37:27,894 --> 00:37:31,214
to take
a political decision.

603
00:37:33,374 --> 00:37:36,614
Prof. Doug Cassel: If the president
cree should torture someone ...

604
00:37:36,734 --> 00:37:40,254
including crushing the testicles
child of that person ...

605
00:37:40,374 --> 00:37:42,454
Is there no law to prevent it?

606
00:37:42,574 --> 00:37:44,454
That is what I wrote
in their memorandum of 2002.

607
00:37:44,574 --> 00:37:48,854
John Yoo: I think that depends on
why must I see the president.

608
00:37:49,054 --> 00:37:50,934
The lawyer's
army were outraged by ...

609
00:37:51,054 --> 00:37:53,214
the implications of
Memorandum from John Yoo.

610
00:37:53,614 --> 00:37:56,214
I began to engage
on this issue when I ...

611
00:37:56,254 --> 00:37:59,374
visited a group of lawyers
military top-class ...

612
00:37:59,454 --> 00:38:02,614
more than a year after the
first news about Abu Ghraib.

613
00:38:02,694 --> 00:38:05,334
Those who were concerned
much what happened.

614
00:38:05,414 --> 00:38:08,774
And his main concern
was that the controls ...

615
00:38:08,854 --> 00:38:13,454
military were responsible
for the acts of the soldiers ...

616
00:38:13,534 --> 00:38:17,694
which were responsible for
offer clear guidelines ...

617
00:38:17,774 --> 00:38:21,454
and straight on how to behave in
some very difficult circumstances.

618
00:38:21,534 --> 00:38:25,014
And what we saw was
a decision ...

619
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:28,374
intentionally in the most
upper echelons of the Pentagon ...

620
00:38:28,454 --> 00:38:31,734
to circumvent all these issues
with a haze of ambiguity ...

621
00:38:31,814 --> 00:38:36,014
accompanied by a high pressure
for results.

622
00:38:36,094 --> 00:38:39,934
To be willing to
violent prisoners.

623
00:38:40,054 --> 00:38:46,094
But to use violence
the detainees is a crime.

624
00:38:47,254 --> 00:38:52,774
Perhaps Al Qaeda or Taliban
or the worst people in the world ...

625
00:38:52,934 --> 00:38:56,934
and it is certain that some are,
but there are certain rules ...

626
00:38:57,014 --> 00:39:00,854
Basic and international agreements
signed by the U.S. ...

627
00:39:00,934 --> 00:39:04,494
we must meet.
Forward, reply, please.

628
00:39:04,614 --> 00:39:06,294
Allow me a quick clarification.

629
00:39:06,414 --> 00:39:09,774
On the president's policy,
how to proceed ...

630
00:39:09,894 --> 00:39:12,294
Armed Forces
the U.S. is trying to follow ...

631
00:39:12,374 --> 00:39:15,094
the prisoners humanely,
adequately ...

632
00:39:15,214 --> 00:39:17,214
and according to the
military needs ...

633
00:39:17,294 --> 00:39:20,414
according to the principles of
Geneva Convention.

634
00:39:20,534 --> 00:39:24,894
It is a legal affirmation
riddled with loopholes.

635
00:39:24,974 --> 00:39:30,214
And it is clear that the interrogators
did not understand that the humane treatment ...

636
00:39:30,294 --> 00:39:33,014
does not depend on color
the beholder.

637
00:39:34,294 --> 00:39:38,014
On the ground in Afghanistan,
spread confusion ...

638
00:39:38,094 --> 00:39:40,614
about what
exactly the rules.

639
00:39:40,734 --> 00:39:42,894
We were told that the
Dealing with the "PUC" ...

640
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:45,534
ie person
custody of the U.S. ...

641
00:39:45,694 --> 00:39:48,774
is not subject to the Convention
of Geneva, in a nutshell ...

642
00:39:48,894 --> 00:39:52,454
the only thing we were not allowed
do was give them beatings.

643
00:39:52,894 --> 00:39:56,574
Persons or persons in control
custody or something.

644
00:39:56,694 --> 00:40:00,614
The call to dehumanize and
and not consider them persons.

645
00:40:00,854 --> 00:40:05,174
I do not remember having heard anything
on the Geneva Convention.

646
00:40:06,214 --> 00:40:11,614
Of course, I know, but not
told us about it.

647
00:40:11,694 --> 00:40:14,334
Unaware of what the manual said
Army on interrogations ...

648
00:40:14,414 --> 00:40:16,734
unaware of how they defined
the manual, I had seen ...

649
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:19,534
had a copy lying around,
I am sure that ...

650
00:40:19,614 --> 00:40:22,894
and if he had wanted,
I would have taken to read it ...

651
00:40:23,014 --> 00:40:25,774
but worked 16 hours a day.

652
00:40:25,894 --> 00:40:31,134
Sit to read a regulation
was not my highest priority there.

653
00:40:31,574 --> 00:40:35,934
It is a shameful situation,
vicious, dangerous and dirty.

654
00:40:36,054 --> 00:40:38,374
And we operate
in that environment.

655
00:40:38,454 --> 00:40:40,854
I am convinced that
we can achieve and successfully.

656
00:40:40,934 --> 00:40:46,014
But we must take care not handcuff
our intelligence services ...

657
00:40:46,094 --> 00:40:49,014
in carrying out its mission.

658
00:40:49,094 --> 00:40:51,774
Play around with terrorists
completely different rules.

659
00:40:51,894 --> 00:40:53,894
Will we be required,
using their own words ...

660
00:40:53,934 --> 00:40:57,054
to be outrageous, atrocious and dirty
to deal with them?

661
00:40:57,094 --> 00:40:58,614
Yeah.

662
00:40:59,774 --> 00:41:03,534
LAB.

663
00:41:08,294 --> 00:41:11,294
Guided by the advice
John Yoo's legal ...

664
00:41:11,374 --> 00:41:15,574
the Bush administration sent
Prisoners considered important ...

665
00:41:15,694 --> 00:41:19,934
the U.S. Naval Base
at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

666
00:41:21,174 --> 00:41:23,774
At first I thought he
was a safe place.

667
00:41:23,894 --> 00:41:26,294
You know, put them there,
surrounded by barbed wire.

668
00:41:26,414 --> 00:41:30,494
But then it became clear
that the reason for doing so ...

669
00:41:30,614 --> 00:41:34,734
was that we could argue
there were no laws.

670
00:41:34,774 --> 00:41:37,934
Cuban laws and
Americans did not apply.

671
00:41:38,054 --> 00:41:40,854
That was a great
false step.

672
00:41:40,854 --> 00:41:43,934
I think that what people wanted
makers was to find ...

673
00:41:44,054 --> 00:41:48,734
a place close to the U.S.
could be well protected ...

674
00:41:48,774 --> 00:41:50,734
but at the same time
could benefit from ...

675
00:41:50,854 --> 00:41:52,774
the rule that says the
U.S. Army ...

676
00:41:52,894 --> 00:41:54,734
has the last word
with regard to ...

677
00:41:54,854 --> 00:41:58,254
control of prisoners
kept outside the country.

678
00:42:01,454 --> 00:42:03,974
One by one, the terrorists
are learning ...

679
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:06,654
what the
U.S. justice.

680
00:42:22,014 --> 00:42:25,934
In December 2001, a man
named Mohammed al-Qahtani ...

681
00:42:26,054 --> 00:42:29,894
was transferred from
Afghanistan to Guantanamo.

682
00:42:31,134 --> 00:42:35,014
After eight months of captivity,
discovered that the army could ...

683
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:37,894
have been trained to be the
twentieth hijacker air 11 / 9.

684
00:42:37,934 --> 00:42:43,454
Suddenly, al-Qahtani became
the most important prisoner in Guantanamo.

685
00:42:46,454 --> 00:42:48,894
Here was a man
that I should have been ...

686
00:42:49,014 --> 00:42:51,934
on the plane as far
outside Pennsylvania.

687
00:42:52,054 --> 00:42:54,094
JAY HOOD, commander of the
FORCES IN GUANTANAMO 2004-2006.

688
00:42:54,254 --> 00:42:56,454
So I think they felt
the urgency to find out ...

689
00:42:56,534 --> 00:42:59,534
he knew what kind, so
prevent future attacks.

690
00:42:59,614 --> 00:43:03,854
Resist interrogation techniques
usual at Guantanamo ...

691
00:43:03,974 --> 00:43:06,654
for eight months and he
is the reason ...

692
00:43:06,734 --> 00:43:08,774
LIEUTENANT GRAL. RANDALL SCHMIDT,
AUTHOR OF THE REPORT SCHMIDT.

693
00:43:08,854 --> 00:43:11,134
the detachment of Guantanamo
requested the use of other techniques ...

694
00:43:11,254 --> 00:43:13,974
able to overcome resistance
for which he had been trained.

695
00:43:15,494 --> 00:43:19,774
In September 2002,
John Yoo and Alberto Gonzales ...

696
00:43:19,894 --> 00:43:22,014
traveled to Guantanamo.

697
00:43:22,854 --> 00:43:25,774
Shortly after his visit and
just before the arrival of ...

698
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:29,854
Dilawar at Bagram, Donald
Rumsfeld personally approved ...

699
00:43:29,934 --> 00:43:32,214
a new set of
psychological techniques ...

700
00:43:32,254 --> 00:43:35,934
interrogation, for use
with Mohammed al-Qahtani.

701
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:39,694
The exact
these methods ...

702
00:43:39,774 --> 00:43:44,094
often entrusted to the imagination
of the interrogators.

703
00:43:45,014 --> 00:43:48,014
"WAS THE STYLE AVOCADO Californians.
That is, totally free. "

2002 to early 2003 ...

709
00:44:01,494 --> 00:44:03,654
He was subjected to this regime.

711
00:44:05,654 --> 00:44:08,534
Which included an intense
sleep deprivation.

714
00:44:13,294 --> 00:44:17,654
He was only allowed to sleep four
hours per day from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m..

715
00:44:17,734 --> 00:44:19,214
20 hours of interrogation.

716
00:44:19,294 --> 00:44:22,174
And so for 50 days,
with one exception.

717
00:44:23,374 --> 00:44:26,734
Placed in strict isolation
and private feelings.

FEAR OF ARRESTED (eg dogs)

720
00:44:35,894 --> 00:44:38,454
According to the newspaper,
There were several occasions ...

721
00:44:38,534 --> 00:44:40,614
which a woman
invaded your living space.

722
00:44:40,694 --> 00:44:42,774
And it was a

723
00:44:42,854 --> 00:44:44,934
intended to undermine their faith.

PAGE 56: A woman invaded

726
00:44:49,614 --> 00:44:51,694
back, he whispered to
ear and stroked her hair.

727
00:44:51,774 --> 00:44:55,214
It was a practice that allowed
called "the futility of technology."

728
00:44:55,294 --> 00:44:58,694
Your mother is a whore.

729
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:04,534

I would call "sexual assault".

732
00:45:10,254 --> 00:45:12,854
It was called a homosexual
on many occasions.

733
00:45:12,974 --> 00:45:15,214
And he said his
colleagues knew.

734
00:45:15,294 --> 00:45:17,974
He was made to dance with
an interrogator.

735
00:45:18,054 --> 00:45:20,894
He was forced to strip

00:46:54,694 --> 00:46:57,934
of torture by the CIA as
Over the past 50 years.

759
00:46:58,454 --> 00:47:01,254
The CIA launched a
mental control project ...

760
00:47:01,334 --> 00:47:04,334
an authentic Manhattan Project
mental domain in 1950.

761
00:47:04,414 --> 00:47:07,894
The CIA investigated
exotic techniques such as ...

762
00:47:08,014 --> 00:47:10,694
hypnosis and then
Sodium pentothal with ...

763
00:47:10,814 --> 00:47:12,894
and later with
electric shock.

764
00:47:12,974 --> 00:47:16,574
And in the end discovered LSD.
Anything ...

765
00:47:16,654 --> 00:47:19,894
the drug had no consequences
except for the lawsuits.

766
00:47:20,054 --> 00:47:24,094
But what if it works, was
that the CIA hired the service ...

767
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:27,094
most of the scholars preclaros
of behavioral science ...

768

772
00:47:38,774 --> 00:47:41,254
Dr. Hebb found
which could induce a ...

773
00:47:41,374 --> 00:47:45,774
state similar to
48 hours in acute hypnosis.

774
00:47:46,054 --> 00:47:48,254
And all they did was sit
students to volunteer ...

775
00:47:48,374 --> 00:47:50,894
comfortable in a cubicle
with air conditioning ...

776
00:47:51,014 --> 00:47:53,454
with glasses,
some earmuffs and gloves.

777
00:47:53,614 --> 00:47:56,374
Looked exactly the same
the prisoners in Guantanamo.

778
00:47:56,454 --> 00:47:59,414
Those costumes that lead
Prisoners at Guantanamo ...

779
00:47:59,454 --> 00:48:02,294
with gloves, goggles and earmuffs.

780
00:48:02,374 --> 00:48:06,454
Everyone thinks it is for safety.
No, it is to isolate sensorially.

781
00:48:06,574 --> 00:48:11,454
The first day you have hallucinations,
the two can no longer more.

782
00:48:11,534 --> 00:48:14,414
When we were making
experiments, I started thinking ...

783
00:48:14,534 --> 00:48:18,534
it was possible that something
involve physical ...

784
00:48:18,814 --> 00:48:21,774
or even pain, could
be more tolerable than the ...

785
00:48:21,894 --> 00:48:25,214
simple conditions
deprivation studied.

786
00:48:25,294 --> 00:48:28,374
The CIA was fascinated, it was
rushed over immediately.

787
00:48:28,494 --> 00:48:32,614
I had no idea that he could
become a weapon so cruel.

788
00:48:32,694 --> 00:48:35,574
Identified two key techniques:

789
00:48:35,614 --> 00:48:38,094
Identified
sensory disorientation.

790
00:48:38,174 --> 00:48:40,454
And identify the pain
self when standing ...

791
00:48:40,614 --> 00:48:43,894
for several days with liquid
accumulate in the legs.

792
00:48:44,014 --> 00:48:45,934
And together in the ...

793
00:48:46,094 --> 00:48:49,294
"Manual on Interrogation Kurbak
in Counter.

794
00:48:49,454 --> 00:48:52,174
And the spread of
around the world and all ...

795
00:48:52,254 --> 00:48:55,014
services
intelligence.

796
00:48:55,734 --> 00:48:58,254
Think of the treatment
that al-Qahtani was subjected.

797
00:48:58,414 --> 00:49:02,974
First there is darkness, then
Light passes cold, then heat.

798
00:49:03,054 --> 00:49:07,134
They attack their receptors
perceived by the world.

799
00:49:07,254 --> 00:49:08,974
And their upset
perception of time.

800
00:49:09,054 --> 00:49:11,534
And this is the first phase.

801
00:49:11,814 --> 00:49:15,974
In Guantanamo, under
General Miller's regime ...

802
00:49:16,094 --> 00:49:18,374
he became a Guantanamo
veritable laboratory ...

803
00:49:18,454 --> 00:49:20,974
of the behavioral sciences.

804
00:49:21,094 --> 00:49:25,294
And Donald Rumsfeld, ordered to use
methods to overcome the manual.

805
00:49:25,414 --> 00:49:28,734
And spread, spread
ambiguous in a way so ...

806
00:49:28,814 --> 00:49:33,694
allowing people to make
as deemed necessary.

807
00:49:33,774 --> 00:49:36,774
And explored the sensitivity
arabic men ...

808
00:49:36,894 --> 00:49:38,934
before sex
and sexual identity.

809
00:49:39,054 --> 00:49:41,614
And hence the charge
being gay ...

810
00:49:41,734 --> 00:49:44,894
underwear on
head and all those things.

811
00:49:45,014 --> 00:49:48,934
People said that the Arabs are
very sensitive to sexual humiliation.

812
00:49:49,054 --> 00:49:52,774
Well, what the hell and who is not
sensitive to sexual humiliation?

813
00:49:52,894 --> 00:49:55,774
Nobody wants you naked
and forced to masturbate ...

814
00:49:55,894 --> 00:49:58,214
with a hood on his head.
It'sa ridiculous.

815
00:49:58,254 --> 00:50:01,774
Then set up specialized teams
in the behavioral sciences.

816
00:50:01,854 --> 00:50:05,534
And there was the army that psychologists
participating in interrogations ...

817
00:50:05,614 --> 00:50:09,134
to discover the fears
and phobias of each prisoner.

818
00:50:09,734 --> 00:50:13,494
And all this was done in
If al-Qahtani.

819
00:50:13,574 --> 00:50:16,214
Did the communications
between General Miller ...

820
00:50:16,374 --> 00:50:20,174
and Secretary Rumsfeld on
prisoner in this specific?

821
00:50:20,294 --> 00:50:22,854
To our knowledge,
had a considerable amount ...

822
00:50:22,974 --> 00:50:25,654
communications
entire chain of command.

823
00:50:29,054 --> 00:50:31,294
As you know,
The report by Schmidt ...

824
00:50:31,454 --> 00:50:33,694
it concluded that these
techniques alone ...

825
00:50:33,774 --> 00:50:37,454
did not constitute torture, but said
than the sum of these techniques:

826
00:50:37,574 --> 00:50:40,054
The cumulative effect
the application ...

827
00:50:40,094 --> 00:50:42,614
many simultaneous
authorized methods ...

828
00:50:42,694 --> 00:50:45,374
had an abusive
and demeaning to the person.

829
00:50:45,454 --> 00:50:49,454
And recommended that the General
Miller was punished.

830
00:50:50,894 --> 00:50:53,454
But she said
did not constitute torture.

831
00:50:53,574 --> 00:50:55,854
We made a distinction
between torture ...

832
00:50:55,934 --> 00:50:58,294
and inhumane treatment
according to the ...

833
00:50:58,414 --> 00:51:01,334
General Guidelines
and then what could be abusive ...

834
00:51:01,414 --> 00:51:04,014
and degrading.
Something can be degrading ...

835
00:51:04,134 --> 00:51:07,174
but not necessarily torture.
Can not be inhumane ...

836
00:51:07,294 --> 00:51:10,774
but humiliating
but not torture.

837
00:51:10,854 --> 00:51:13,214
Or torture, or pain
physical, or injuries.

838
00:51:13,334 --> 00:51:16,454
The environment was safe and devoid
risk at all times.

839
00:51:16,534 --> 00:51:19,294
And of course, therein lies
the genius of the paradigm ...

840
00:51:19,454 --> 00:51:21,374
psychological CIA.

841
00:51:21,494 --> 00:51:24,174
Psychological torture is
a question of definitions.

842
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:26,454
And of course,
is very elusive.

843
00:51:27,214 --> 00:51:31,294
That sounds remarkably similar
what happened at Abu Ghraib.

844
00:51:31,454 --> 00:51:34,414
People with the collar
dogs, forced to put ...

845
00:51:34,534 --> 00:51:39,694
lingerie. Perhaps a
coincidence, maybe not.

846
00:51:41,454 --> 00:51:43,454
If you look at the
photographs from Abu Ghraib ...

847
00:51:43,574 --> 00:51:45,614
that will always
the same techniques.

848
00:51:45,734 --> 00:51:48,934
The first is the activity
sex with the woman's clothes.

849
00:51:49,094 --> 00:51:51,254
Masturbation and the like.

850
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:53,374
This is exploited
sensitivity of their culture.

851
00:51:53,454 --> 00:51:55,534
They were immobilized with
short chains and long ...

852
00:51:55,614 --> 00:51:59,254
upside down, those are
stress positions.

853
00:51:59,374 --> 00:52:03,174
The most infamous of all
the photos of Abu Ghraib ...

854
00:52:03,254 --> 00:52:07,494
is that of the hooded Iraqi on
a box with arms outstretched.

855
00:52:07,694 --> 00:52:10,454
He was told that if they fell
of the box, if you moved ...

856
00:52:10,574 --> 00:52:13,894
is electrocutaría. So
counterfeit electrical cables.

857
00:52:13,974 --> 00:52:17,214
Is the absolute immobility
for long periods of time.

858
00:52:17,374 --> 00:52:19,814
And with
arms outstretched.

859
00:52:19,934 --> 00:52:22,294
On television they say never
try to do this at home.

860
00:52:22,374 --> 00:52:26,014
But try,
try spending 10 minutes ...

861
00:52:26,094 --> 00:52:29,774
with arms outstretched
and unmoving.

862
00:52:30,214 --> 00:52:33,214
Carolyn Wood was an example
how new techniques ...

863
00:52:33,254 --> 00:52:36,454
spread
and as a mutated virus.

864
00:52:36,694 --> 00:52:39,254
Before that Wood would
charge of interrogations ...

865
00:52:39,294 --> 00:52:41,854
at Abu Ghraib,
his unit had practiced ...

866
00:52:41,934 --> 00:52:44,774
brutal techniques at Bagram,
such as stress positions ...

867
00:52:44,934 --> 00:52:47,574
required long periods of standing,
and sleep deprivation.

868
00:52:47,694 --> 00:52:51,574
One of the memos, which shows
in early December 2002 ...

869
00:52:51,614 --> 00:52:55,614
Bagram interrogators that
were in contact with the types of ...

870
00:52:55,734 --> 00:52:59,574
Guantánamo via the Internet,
they learned that they had ...

871
00:52:59,614 --> 00:53:02,134
received from the Secretary of State
new methods of instruction.

872
00:53:02,254 --> 00:53:05,494
And began to use
although it clearly ...

873
00:53:05,574 --> 00:53:09,494
had been approved for use
nothing else in Guantánamo.

874
00:53:10,774 --> 00:53:14,214
When the Gral Miller
traveled from Guantanamo ...

875
00:53:14,334 --> 00:53:18,654
to Iraq in August 2003
brought a CD and a manual ...

876
00:53:18,774 --> 00:53:21,614
Advanced techniques
developed at Guantanamo ...

877
00:53:21,734 --> 00:53:25,094
and gave the
Gen. Sanchez's command.

878
00:53:25,294 --> 00:53:27,894
So there
these multiple paths ...

879
00:53:27,974 --> 00:53:31,414
to track where
These interrogation techniques ...

880
00:53:31,494 --> 00:53:35,694
performed this migration overall.
From Afghanistan to Iraq ...

881
00:53:35,774 --> 00:53:38,214
and from Guantanamo
directly to Iraq.

882
00:53:38,254 --> 00:53:41,174
And the final result,
is Abu Ghraib.

883
00:53:44,214 --> 00:53:47,454
Long before knowing
abuses at Abu Ghraib ...

884
00:53:47,574 --> 00:53:50,454
civil servants had
discretely alerting ...

885
00:53:50,534 --> 00:53:54,414
techniques bestial
used at Guantanamo.

886
00:53:54,454 --> 00:53:57,374
Had sent e-mails
the Department of Justice ...

887
00:53:57,454 --> 00:53:59,934
FBI personnel
at Guantanamo, saying:

888
00:54:00,054 --> 00:54:03,214
"Do not believe what
is happening here. "

889
00:54:03,334 --> 00:54:06,134
"The FBI must dissociate
what is ...

890
00:54:06,254 --> 00:54:09,694
going
at Guantanamo. "

891
00:54:10,334 --> 00:54:12,894
The email reads:
"The Department of Defense ...

892
00:54:12,974 --> 00:54:16,214
has orders
Secretary of Defense. "

893
00:54:17,214 --> 00:54:20,654
Orders of the Secretary of
Defense tactics to use ...

894
00:54:20,774 --> 00:54:25,454
that the FBI considered extremely
offensive and dangerous.

895
00:54:25,534 --> 00:54:28,614
But the emails,
are, what we call ...

896
00:54:28,694 --> 00:54:33,614
"Editing", which means
there are big gaps in them.

897
00:54:33,774 --> 00:54:36,574
Now, some are completely
edited so that ...

898
00:54:36,614 --> 00:54:39,094
ignore what they say.
This is an example ...

899
00:54:39,254 --> 00:54:42,774
Many of the documents
we have here.

900
00:54:43,454 --> 00:54:46,094
You can not see anything
in these documents.

901
00:54:46,254 --> 00:54:50,254
One after another there is nothing.

902
00:54:52,294 --> 00:54:55,934
THE INFORMANT.

903
00:54:56,534 --> 00:55:01,654
In early December 2002,
continued to abuse detainees.

904
00:55:01,734 --> 00:55:03,414
ALBERTO MORA, ATTORNEY GENERAL
ARMY OF 2001 to 2006.

905
00:55:03,534 --> 00:55:05,894
I called the General Counsel
Army and asked ...

906
00:55:06,014 --> 00:55:08,014
if he had any information,
I said: "I get some reports ...

907
00:55:08,134 --> 00:55:10,614
Abuse of prisoners in
Guantanamo, you know something about it. "

908
00:55:10,734 --> 00:55:15,774
And his answer was: "I know a lot
on the subject, come to my office. "

909
00:55:15,894 --> 00:55:18,974
I spent a pile of
documents on the table ...

910
00:55:19,094 --> 00:55:22,614
The first document was a
Memorandum of General Counsel ...

911
00:55:22,734 --> 00:55:25,454
DoD
for Secretary Rumsfeld.

912
00:55:25,534 --> 00:55:27,574
Memorandum was a covert
in asking ...

913
00:55:27,694 --> 00:55:31,174
authorization to apply certain
methods of interrogation.

914
00:55:31,294 --> 00:55:33,894
There was approval
Secretary Rumsfeld's ...

915
00:55:34,014 --> 00:55:36,254
to implement
Some of these methods.

916
00:55:37,094 --> 00:55:40,054
In this memorandum is a
Secretary Rumsfeld's note ...

917
00:55:40,174 --> 00:55:42,414
that says if it passes
8 to 10 hours of walking ...

918
00:55:42,534 --> 00:55:47,934
how was that these detainees
only spend 4 hours daily walk.

919
00:55:48,054 --> 00:55:51,454
I was dumbfounded. My first
reaction was to believe that it was a mistake ...

920
00:55:51,574 --> 00:55:56,374
someone who had not read the
document with precise care.

921
00:55:56,774 --> 00:55:58,854
I think people's
Pentagon considered ...

922
00:55:58,934 --> 00:56:03,894
Alberto Mora a loyal Republican,
in an important political post ...

923
00:56:03,974 --> 00:56:08,614
never would have considered
a problem or a liberal.

924
00:56:08,694 --> 00:56:14,254
He said he hoped
raise these issues.

925
00:56:14,374 --> 00:56:18,894
And that people in authority read:
"Ah, thanks for telling us."

926
00:56:19,014 --> 00:56:21,094
And that would be the
end of all this.

927
00:56:21,654 --> 00:56:25,614
I wanted to ask about a
memorandum written by Alberto Mora.

928
00:56:25,734 --> 00:56:29,294
Remember that this memorandum
wrote a note that they have ...

929
00:56:29,454 --> 00:56:31,814
to spend more than 4 hours
stand because you do?

930
00:56:31,934 --> 00:56:33,454
Yes, yes.

931
00:56:33,614 --> 00:56:37,454
Counsel argues that this
could be interpreted as ...

932
00:56:37,574 --> 00:56:44,454
seemed to go well beyond the
techniques prescribed in the memorandum.

933
00:56:44,574 --> 00:56:47,294
No, no ... Not given
understand anything.

934
00:56:47,454 --> 00:56:52,374
They said that they would have to
People stand for several hours.

935
00:56:52,454 --> 00:56:59,294
And jokingly noted that a setentón
as I spent all day standing.

936
00:56:59,414 --> 00:57:04,534
Although I should not do,
and it was well written.

937
00:57:04,614 --> 00:57:07,654
- And life goes on.
- But he is concerned ...

938
00:57:07,734 --> 00:57:10,974
should be advised to
best for their legal department.

939
00:57:11,054 --> 00:57:12,734
And I heard your question the first time.

940
00:57:13,614 --> 00:57:15,974
For me the most disturbing
was that the techniques themselves ...

941
00:57:16,054 --> 00:57:19,014
alone or in combination could
reach the level of torture.

942
00:57:19,134 --> 00:57:21,214
Well, allow certain
interrogation techniques ...

943
00:57:21,294 --> 00:57:23,534
but since then has
to be some limit ...

944
00:57:23,614 --> 00:57:26,494
it depends on the
harsh methods.

945
00:57:26,894 --> 00:57:29,774
The deprivation of light could
mean having the prisoner ...

946
00:57:29,854 --> 00:57:31,854
in a dark room
for 15 minutes.

947
00:57:31,934 --> 00:57:35,614
Or it could be a month or two or three,
until you go blind.

948
00:57:36,214 --> 00:57:38,854
Specific techniques
phobias of each detainee.

949
00:57:38,934 --> 00:57:41,174
It refers to snakes,
the bats, the rats ...

950
00:57:41,254 --> 00:57:44,054
to lock someone in a coffin,
the only limit is your imagination ...

951
00:57:44,174 --> 00:57:47,534
any of these methods
alone could be seen ...

952
00:57:47,614 --> 00:57:51,454
including torture and together could certainly
reach that level soon.

953
00:57:51,934 --> 00:57:55,294
Dr. Donald Hebb: If subjected to
person during this process ...

954
00:57:55,414 --> 00:58:00,374
more than six or eight days,
I think that is the maximum tolerable ...

955
00:58:00,574 --> 00:58:04,174
- ... Then the price is very high.
- Is the price someone's life?

956
00:58:04,294 --> 00:58:06,294
Presumably, it could be.

957
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:09,134
The medical literature describes
a phenomenon called ...

958
00:58:09,214 --> 00:58:12,294
"Rising Force"
that was almost inevitable that ...

959
00:58:12,414 --> 00:58:14,694
interrogators continue
increases in applied ...

960
00:58:14,774 --> 00:58:17,694
force for increasing
obtain the desired results.

961
00:58:17,774 --> 00:58:20,534
For example, in making the memorandum
Secretary Rumsfeld's ...

962
00:58:20,614 --> 00:58:23,774
say, "Look, he says that
Dogs must wear a muzzle. "

963
00:58:23,854 --> 00:58:27,014
Well this man does not understand
the behavior of ...

964
00:58:27,134 --> 00:58:29,134
in a military zone
conflict, because as soon as the ...

965
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:32,774
soldier to see that the dog
because the muzzle not ...

966
00:58:32,894 --> 00:58:37,774
impressed at all
interrogated, he was removed.

967
00:58:38,574 --> 00:58:41,774
That is the reality,
it is human nature.

968
00:58:42,934 --> 00:58:45,574
Alberto Mora threatened
to make public their ...

969
00:58:45,694 --> 00:58:49,454
concerns unless
ended such practices.

970
00:58:49,534 --> 00:58:53,614
If after all
there is concern ...

971
00:58:53,694 --> 00:58:56,254
then I am also concerned,
so I'm ready ...

972
00:58:56,374 --> 00:58:58,774
to cancel the orders, giving
A new approach to the case y. ..

973
00:58:58,854 --> 00:59:01,934
talk to people all over this
to see what should be done.

974
00:59:02,054 --> 00:59:04,094
, To his
Rumsfeld to abolish the ...

975
00:59:04,214 --> 00:59:07,414
interrogation techniques and
for a year and a half later ...

976
00:59:07,534 --> 00:59:09,734
not receive any
report that ...

977
00:59:09,814 --> 00:59:12,334
was abusing the
detainees anywhere.

978
00:59:18,774 --> 00:59:22,454
When it was discovered at Abu Ghraib,
the first thing I thought was ...

979
00:59:22,654 --> 00:59:24,774
if I had been deceived.

980
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:31,214
If authorized the abuse of
prisoners without my knowledge.

981
00:59:33,374 --> 00:59:37,054
You really had
withdrawn the orders?

982
00:59:38,254 --> 00:59:42,614
According to the interrogators, the use
of shackles, dogs, posture ...

983
00:59:42,694 --> 00:59:47,294
forced and sensory assault,
continued to spread.

984
00:59:48,414 --> 00:59:52,254
Tony Lagouranis was an interrogator
who came to Iraq after ...

985
00:59:52,294 --> 00:59:55,454
that the army knew
of abuse at Abu Ghraib.

986
00:59:56,414 --> 00:59:59,374
Among the instructions for
interviews they gave us ...

987
00:59:59,454 --> 01:00:02,094
stated that the authorizing
use of dogs to detainees ...

988
01:00:02,214 --> 01:00:05,054
stress positions,
sleep deprivation.

989
01:00:05,174 --> 01:00:08,214
All those things you did
and that it took ...

990
01:00:08,294 --> 01:00:12,974
brutal or violating the Convention
Geneva told me to do that.

991
01:00:13,094 --> 01:00:16,854
And were our superiors
we were told to do so.

992
01:00:19,094 --> 01:00:21,294
The backbone
Armed Forces ...

993
01:00:21,454 --> 01:00:24,094
Americans is
chain of command.

994
01:00:24,294 --> 01:00:26,294
What begins in the
top of the chain of command ...

995
01:00:26,454 --> 01:00:28,974
falls like a stone
the lower end of that chain.

996
01:00:29,094 --> 01:00:32,734
And that's why Lynndie England
Donald knew what he believed ...

997
01:00:32,774 --> 01:00:36,254
Rumsfeld even without
talking with Donald Rumsfeld.

998
01:00:38,534 --> 01:00:41,094
In full Abu resaca
Ghraib, journalists ...

999
01:00:41,214 --> 01:00:44,414
began to look harder
in previous cases of abuse ...

1000
01:00:44,454 --> 01:00:49,454
to try to understand what the
cause and who were responsible.

1001
01:00:50,934 --> 01:00:53,934
People like Tim Golden's
New York Times, addressed the topic ...

1002
01:00:54,014 --> 01:00:57,734
and began to examine the case of
Including Dilawar, the taxi driver.

1003
01:00:57,894 --> 01:01:03,174
I seemed at least plausible that
that man was not guilty ... more

1004
01:01:03,294 --> 01:01:05,734
that are at
the time of the raid.

1005
01:01:05,814 --> 01:01:09,974
And here is a man
killed while in custody.

1006
01:01:11,574 --> 01:01:16,534
THE WRONG MAN.

1007
01:01:19,894 --> 01:01:22,694
... pay tribute to those who
were killed ...

1008
01:01:22,774 --> 01:01:25,774
who are
selflessly every day.

1009
01:01:25,894 --> 01:01:29,574
Four years ago,
our nation was attacked.

1010
01:01:29,694 --> 01:01:32,094
9 / 11 in the floating
environment, and I think that ...

1011
01:01:32,254 --> 01:01:34,094
officials wanted to continue
floating in the atmosphere.

1012
01:01:34,214 --> 01:01:38,574
Try to remember these guys
that people are our enemy ...

1013
01:01:38,614 --> 01:01:41,014
but to understand how
iban these young soldiers ...

1014
01:01:41,094 --> 01:01:43,934
to discern who were the
real enemies ...

1015
01:01:44,094 --> 01:01:46,574
among a lot of
militia and peasants ...

1016
01:01:46,694 --> 01:01:49,694
in a society
completely alien to them.

1017
01:01:53,254 --> 01:01:56,774
If I remember correctly,
his case was about ...

1018
01:01:56,894 --> 01:01:59,454
with a missile attack
to a military base.

1019
01:01:59,534 --> 01:02:02,854
It was assumed that he was the driver
the order in which they fled.

1020
01:02:02,934 --> 01:02:06,654
Took his new car and
was obviously very happy.

1021
01:02:06,774 --> 01:02:09,134
That was until Khost
the provincial capital ...

1022
01:02:09,254 --> 01:02:12,414
where he began to seek
for taxi passengers.

1023
01:02:12,494 --> 01:02:18,494
In fact these three men found
in the market returning to Yakubi.

1024
01:02:22,414 --> 01:02:28,054
Imagine, again Dilawar
home from the capital ...

1025
01:02:28,134 --> 01:02:31,534
which was the Provincial
farther from their small world.

1026
01:02:31,654 --> 01:02:37,534
And on the basis of the artillery Salerno
stop a group of Afghan militia.

1027
01:02:37,614 --> 01:02:40,694
Apparently, men
found a stabilizer ...

1028
01:02:40,774 --> 01:02:44,294
electricity in the trunk of
car, or at least it said.

1029
01:02:45,414 --> 01:02:50,294
That same day the base Salerno had
been attacked with missiles from a distance.

1030
01:02:50,414 --> 01:02:53,414
And the Afghan militiamen arrested
immediately to the four ...

1031
01:02:53,534 --> 01:02:57,414
men who were suspected
be involved in that attack.

1032
01:02:59,374 --> 01:03:03,254
And then take him to
Bagram that is far away.

1033
01:03:03,734 --> 01:03:07,454
And you have a lot of types
in this detention center ...

1034
01:03:07,534 --> 01:03:10,574
and they say they have evidence
involved in an attack ...

1035
01:03:10,654 --> 01:03:12,774
with missiles
U.S. forces.

1036
01:03:12,854 --> 01:03:15,734
So I think
that whatever the change.

1037
01:03:17,494 --> 01:03:20,094
You are immersed in that
atmosphere in which only ...

1038
01:03:20,214 --> 01:03:22,174
you are in company
military, where you ...

1039
01:03:22,294 --> 01:03:25,934
feel isolated and morally
lose your moral ...

1040
01:03:26,054 --> 01:03:27,934
and are frustrated
because you do not get ...

1041
01:03:28,014 --> 01:03:30,414
information from a prisoner
feel guilty that ...

1042
01:03:30,494 --> 01:03:34,734
and that you feel may dártela,
then start sobrepasarte ...

1043
01:03:34,774 --> 01:03:36,774
want to see
where you can get.

1044
01:03:37,094 --> 01:03:42,254
Much of the pressure was due to
fact that we had a few ...

1045
01:03:42,374 --> 01:03:46,574
detainees who provided important
a lot of useful information.

1046
01:03:46,854 --> 01:03:50,574
And when they began to take
because the prisoners iban ...

1047
01:03:50,694 --> 01:03:55,214
Syria wanted to follow
getting the same around the world.

1048
01:03:55,374 --> 01:03:58,934
A few of those types
interrogábamos by the ...

1049
01:03:59,094 --> 01:04:02,254
mere questioning
and it was ridiculous, you did ...

1050
01:04:02,334 --> 01:04:06,174
with any of those types
and you say: "God ...

1051
01:04:06,254 --> 01:04:08,454
is not him who would
take prisoner. "

1052
01:04:08,454 --> 01:04:10,854
Especially if you watch,
at the precise moment when the ...

1053
01:04:10,974 --> 01:04:13,414
you enter, you realize
that should not be there.

1054
01:04:14,494 --> 01:04:19,414
We arrived a prisoner who was
diminished mental ...

1055
01:04:20,174 --> 01:04:24,694
and Sergeant Loring
argued that it was a theater ...

1056
01:04:24,814 --> 01:04:31,294
one that makes Al Qaeda,
and went and talked to him.

1057
01:04:32,734 --> 01:04:39,094
In short, he bore type
diapers and ate his own feces.

1058
01:04:39,174 --> 01:04:41,894
But still Loring
saying that pretended.

1059
01:04:42,214 --> 01:04:44,574
You said: "We want
going to shout that guy "...

1060
01:04:44,694 --> 01:04:48,094
so I took the box
I was having breakfast cereals ...

1061
01:04:48,214 --> 01:04:51,054
entered the room and said:
"Well, today I played gritarte" ...

1062
01:04:51,094 --> 01:04:55,374
and began: "dehydrated,
substitute for salt, "and me ...

1063
01:04:55,454 --> 01:04:59,174
he shouted,
I watched amazed ...

1064
01:04:59,254 --> 01:05:01,894
and I said "Yes, now you
have cast the blame for ...

1065
01:05:02,014 --> 01:05:06,334
this in my cereal, "or they
shouted that if Elvis was ...

1066
01:05:06,414 --> 01:05:08,814
truly the king of rock and
if still alive, things like that.

1067
01:05:08,894 --> 01:05:12,134
And that what I wrote in my reports,
and deliver them to my superiors ...

1068
01:05:12,254 --> 01:05:14,174
saying that everything we had
been doing for two hours.

1069
01:05:14,414 --> 01:05:18,614
You can not evaluate a person to
not talk to her a few times.

1070
01:05:19,094 --> 01:05:21,134
So the first three
Sometimes talking with someone ...

1071
01:05:21,214 --> 01:05:23,934
only verify the version,
looking for contradictions ...

1072
01:05:24,014 --> 01:05:27,974
looking for gaps, then
the third time, if your version ...

1073
01:05:28,094 --> 01:05:31,694
remained consistent, said
I felt that he was innocent.

1074
01:05:31,934 --> 01:05:34,254
They wanted that
people were guilty ...

1075
01:05:34,374 --> 01:05:36,614
because its unit
was well, and could ...

1076
01:05:36,734 --> 01:05:38,734
we say
60 people arrested ...

1077
01:05:38,854 --> 01:05:40,734
in a month and that all
they were terrorists.

1078
01:05:40,854 --> 01:05:44,254
"When was the last time you saw
Osama Bin Laden and Mullah Omar. "

1079
01:05:44,294 --> 01:05:47,614
These questions were routine
who were all detained.

1080
01:05:47,894 --> 01:05:50,014
It is very difficult to undertake
an interview with ...

1081
01:05:50,094 --> 01:05:52,614
very little evidence and almost never
we had against those guys ...

1082
01:05:52,694 --> 01:05:54,454
and yet they sacábamos
a confession ...

1083
01:05:54,574 --> 01:05:56,894
and you can get
information, but getting ...

1084
01:05:57,014 --> 01:05:59,254
criminalizing a type
himself totally ...

1085
01:05:59,414 --> 01:06:03,134
is very difficult, so you have
techniques that draw ...

1086
01:06:03,254 --> 01:06:06,414
increasingly outrageous to
make such a confession.

1087
01:06:06,534 --> 01:06:10,134
Sergeant Loring, I cried
for being very kind to him ...

1088
01:06:10,254 --> 01:06:12,454
told me that he had
that pressure.

1089
01:06:12,574 --> 01:06:15,694
As he liked to say, I had
that make you feel uncomfortable.

1090
01:06:19,374 --> 01:06:21,534
After a time,
particularly after the fourth ...

1091
01:06:21,654 --> 01:06:25,174
or fifth interview,
when the sleep deprivation ...

1092
01:06:25,214 --> 01:06:29,734
which is starting to subject them
effect of truth ...

1093
01:06:29,854 --> 01:06:32,454
interrogation
intensified.

1094
01:06:32,934 --> 01:06:36,374
The Sergeant Salcedo was a
inexperienced interrogator ...

1095
01:06:36,454 --> 01:06:40,454
but it was taking the initiative,
a prisoner who had not wanted ...

1096
01:06:40,614 --> 01:06:45,614
look for a woman who said that
the frustrated a lot, so I took ...

1097
01:06:45,734 --> 01:06:50,614
and the face turned towards her
look at that and take it seriously.

1098
01:06:50,734 --> 01:06:56,894
But of course, was an Afghan
belonging to a culture ...

1099
01:06:57,014 --> 01:07:01,214
not very conservative tribal
I watched women unknown.

1100
01:07:01,654 --> 01:07:04,334
The Sergeant was Salcedo
I felt a little aggrieved ...

1101
01:07:04,414 --> 01:07:06,254
so I
interposed between them.

1102
01:07:06,334 --> 01:07:11,414
And then when I got
by the shirt and throwing it to the wall.

1103
01:07:11,494 --> 01:07:14,574
They tried to stay standing together
to the wall, but slips ...

1104
01:07:14,694 --> 01:07:16,894
down,
it held against the wall.

1105
01:07:17,014 --> 01:07:22,054
Reasons not understood, no
was more than delusions.

1106
01:07:22,894 --> 01:07:24,894
The interpreter told me that ...

1107
01:07:24,974 --> 01:07:28,374
his wife came to
visit to the cell ...

1108
01:07:28,974 --> 01:07:32,894
which certainly
did not occur.

1109
01:07:33,454 --> 01:07:36,934
I do not know if you ever have seen
someone deprived of sleep ...

1110
01:07:37,534 --> 01:07:41,774
two days to begin
to be idiotizados.

1111
01:07:42,614 --> 01:07:45,614
For three days,
no longer worth anything.

1112
01:07:45,774 --> 01:07:48,574
I knew something was not right.

1113
01:07:48,694 --> 01:07:52,014
The next thing I knew
is that he died.

1114
01:07:53,774 --> 01:07:56,254
Not long after
murder of Dilawar ...

1115
01:07:56,294 --> 01:07:59,174
knew that the
commander of the guerrilla ...

1116
01:07:59,254 --> 01:08:01,934
Afghan arrested
Dilawar and to the other ...

1117
01:08:02,054 --> 01:08:05,134
was arrested for
them Americans.

1118
01:08:05,214 --> 01:08:08,134
And it turned out that he was the one who
rocket struck their base.

1119
01:08:08,254 --> 01:08:11,734
Then captured Afghans
innocent and delivered ...

1120
01:08:11,854 --> 01:08:16,854
the Americans
to ingratiate itself with them.

1121
01:08:19,174 --> 01:08:22,374
The three passengers were
Sent to Guantanamo ...

1122
01:08:22,494 --> 01:08:26,014
Passenger Dilawar.
and did not leave until
March 2004 ...

1123
01:08:26,094 --> 01:08:31,294
ie 15 months after
have been captured.

1124
01:08:33,374 --> 01:08:36,094
It is difficult to know
The reason that ...

1125
01:08:36,174 --> 01:08:38,934
Americans moved
Despite those men ...

1126
01:08:39,054 --> 01:08:42,894
that was completed
no doubt that ...

1127
01:08:42,934 --> 01:08:47,614
Dilawar was at least
innocent when he was murdered.

1128
01:08:50,214 --> 01:08:53,374
Of course, it makes you
if not send to ask ...

1129
01:08:53,454 --> 01:08:58,294
Hence, only those types
to cover their backs.

1130
01:09:02,374 --> 01:09:04,214
Worst of the worst.

1131
01:09:04,294 --> 01:09:07,614
Are not innocent
are the worst of the worst.

1132
01:09:07,734 --> 01:09:11,814
Are among the murderers
most dangerous ...

1133
01:09:11,894 --> 01:09:16,374
best trained and most cruel
that is on the face of the earth.

1134
01:09:16,494 --> 01:09:19,734
Are terrorists, manufacturers
pumps, working with terrorism ...

1135
01:09:19,814 --> 01:09:22,294
are members of Al Qaeda,
Taliban.

1136
01:09:22,414 --> 01:09:25,214
And if they are released,
continue killing.

1137
01:09:25,294 --> 01:09:28,054
All I know with certainty,
they are evil people.

1138
01:09:28,454 --> 01:09:32,934
Despite the fact that Rumsfeld, Cheney and
the Pdte. Bush say that these ...

1139
01:09:33,054 --> 01:09:36,254
types are the worst of the worst
captured on the battlefield ...

1140
01:09:36,374 --> 01:09:40,174
a recent study of
government documents ...

1141
01:09:40,254 --> 01:09:45,614
shows that only 5% of these
people were captured by U.S..

1142
01:09:45,934 --> 01:09:49,934
Only 8% are accused
of belonging to Al Qaeda.

1143
01:09:50,014 --> 01:09:53,454
More than 90% were delivered
by the Northern Alliance ...

1144
01:09:53,574 --> 01:09:56,614
or by Pakistani Forces
in return for rewards.

1145
01:09:56,734 --> 01:09:59,214
Offer substantial
rewards.

1146
01:09:59,294 --> 01:10:06,734
Newsletters that seem to throw
decembrinas snowfall in Chicago.

1147
01:10:07,854 --> 01:10:11,014
An analysis of documents
declassified government ...

1148
01:10:11,094 --> 01:10:14,694
revealed that only 7% of
Guantanamo detainees ...

1149
01:10:14,774 --> 01:10:17,774
were captured by U.S.
and Coalition Forces.

1150
01:10:17,894 --> 01:10:21,574
The remaining 93%,
as Dilawar and his passengers ...

1151
01:10:21,654 --> 01:10:25,134
were handed over by warlords
Afghan and Pakistani ...

1152
01:10:25,214 --> 01:10:28,854
sometimes in exchange for thousands
dollars in cash.

1153
01:10:29,614 --> 01:10:33,854
The army is not interested in spending
$ $ 40,000 a year ...

1154
01:10:33,934 --> 01:10:37,894
on Guantanamo detainee
people who are not Al Qaeda.

1155
01:10:38,014 --> 01:10:42,534
Make sure they are interested in more
that the detainees are actually ...

1156
01:10:42,614 --> 01:10:44,614
members of Al Qaeda
that wasting resources ...

1157
01:10:44,774 --> 01:10:47,374
and stopping time
innocent people.

1158
01:10:47,934 --> 01:10:51,934
It seems natural to stop
people in times of war.

1159
01:10:52,014 --> 01:10:54,614
Want to arrest any of the
suspect that it is dangerous.

1160
01:10:54,774 --> 01:10:57,894
The difference is that the
government first ...

1161
01:10:58,014 --> 01:11:00,854
U.S. history has not
met its own standards ...

1162
01:11:00,974 --> 01:11:03,014
requiring
a trial ...

1163
01:11:03,094 --> 01:11:05,614
immediately following
the capture in case of doubt.

1164
01:11:05,694 --> 01:11:09,574
During the war in Afghanistan, 2001
the U.S. military was ...

1165
01:11:09,574 --> 01:11:11,574
MAYOR DAN MORI. Lawyer
GUANTANAMO DETAINEES IN DAVID HICKS.

1166
01:11:11,654 --> 01:11:13,694
ready to comply with Convention
of Geneva and to hold such trials.

1167
01:11:13,774 --> 01:11:17,414
But the civil authorities of
Defense Department prevented.

1168
01:11:17,814 --> 01:11:19,774
When someone
Afghanistan said ...

1169
01:11:19,894 --> 01:11:22,014
certain person was
an important goal ...

1170
01:11:22,294 --> 01:11:24,894
for any reason
or based in ...

1171
01:11:24,974 --> 01:11:27,454
testimony of another Afghan
who hates that person ...

1172
01:11:27,574 --> 01:11:30,214
and I want to get rid of it
appropriate planting opium ...

1173
01:11:30,294 --> 01:11:34,254
was sent to Guantanamo
and that person no longer ...

1174
01:11:34,294 --> 01:11:38,614
took the form of a claim
nothing and still have it.

1175
01:11:40,254 --> 01:11:43,054
Moazzam Begg, citizen
British suspect ...

1176
01:11:43,174 --> 01:11:45,694
to be associated with commands
Al Qaeda was captured ...

1177
01:11:45,774 --> 01:11:48,774
some agents
Pakistani intelligence.

1178
01:11:48,894 --> 01:11:53,014
I was in my house
Islamabad when I was kidnapped.

1179
01:11:53,094 --> 01:11:55,374
I was a
hood on his head ...

1180
01:11:55,454 --> 01:11:59,214
wives in the hands and feet,
I boarded a car.

1181
01:11:59,454 --> 01:12:02,734
Since that time no
I went to see my family.

1182
01:12:02,814 --> 01:12:05,734
I was sent to Kandahar
and then to Bagram.

1183
01:12:05,854 --> 01:12:09,534
Y cuando me iban a
transfer to Guantanamo ...

1184
01:12:09,614 --> 01:12:14,294
I am covered from head to toe
with all sorts of things.

1185
01:12:14,374 --> 01:12:18,734
A mask, some earrings,
and black glasses just in case ...

1186
01:12:18,814 --> 01:12:21,614
still saw something, a hood
I covered my head.

1187
01:12:21,734 --> 01:12:24,494
Go sit in the plane
was a torment ...

1188
01:12:24,574 --> 01:12:27,374
I had
a third set of shackles that ...

1189
01:12:27,454 --> 01:12:30,414
carried around the waist
and chained to the back.

1190
01:12:30,494 --> 01:12:32,934
It was impossible to move,
impossible to breathe ...

1191
01:12:33,094 --> 01:12:36,414
was impossible to hear anything
so when I got to shout ...

1192
01:12:36,454 --> 01:12:39,574
I implore him one of the guards
I inject something ...

1193
01:12:39,614 --> 01:12:42,054
sleeping.

1194
01:12:50,174 --> 01:12:53,014
We strive for
two years and a half ...

1195
01:12:53,094 --> 01:12:55,174
just to see
prisoners and then ...

1196
01:12:55,254 --> 01:12:57,774
others strive months
for the military ...

1197
01:12:57,854 --> 01:13:00,254
give us the green light
good to go in there.

1198
01:13:00,374 --> 01:13:03,814
What a bizarre thing.
I never thought when ...

1199
01:13:03,894 --> 01:13:06,894
studied law in the U.S. ...

1200
01:13:07,014 --> 01:13:10,854
would have to talk to someone
to have access to my clients ...

1201
01:13:10,934 --> 01:13:13,174
or ask if
They had been tortured.

1202
01:13:13,254 --> 01:13:17,014
The "Habeas Corpus" is the essence
the rule of law.

1203
01:13:17,094 --> 01:13:21,214
Denying people a trial
basic to deprive him of his freedom ...

1204
01:13:21,294 --> 01:13:23,294
is one of the reasons
we made the revolution ...

1205
01:13:23,454 --> 01:13:26,734
so that the King could not deny
anyone of their liberty without trial.

1206
01:14:25,014 --> 01:14:28,054
In June 2004,
two years and a half later ...

1207
01:14:28,134 --> 01:14:30,934
that the first inmates
came to Guantanamo ...

1208
01:14:31,014 --> 01:14:33,534
the Supreme Court rejected
The claim of the administration ...

1209
01:14:33,614 --> 01:14:36,574
Bush to hold
prisoners indefinitely ...

1210
01:14:36,614 --> 01:14:40,454
allow them to challenge
their detention before a court.

1211
01:14:41,054 --> 01:14:43,934
After that decision
the army was ...

1212
01:14:44,094 --> 01:14:46,614
new courts
Special solved ...

1213
01:14:46,734 --> 01:14:49,374
prisoners had
remain in Guantanamo.

1214
01:14:49,454 --> 01:14:51,894
Courts Review
of the Combatant Status ...

1215
01:14:52,014 --> 01:14:55,774
rapidly
by the government nine days after ...

1216
01:14:55,894 --> 01:14:58,894
that to win
the Supreme Court, are a farce.

1217
01:14:59,014 --> 01:15:01,054
You have no rights,
not even a lawyer ...

1218
01:15:01,174 --> 01:15:03,174
not entitled
the testimony of witnesses ...

1219
01:15:03,294 --> 01:15:05,174
unknown
charges brought against you ...

1220
01:15:05,294 --> 01:15:07,334
and ignore what evidence
secret is against you.

1221
01:15:07,414 --> 01:15:10,534
You may never know.
That does not prevent ...

1222
01:15:10,614 --> 01:15:14,854
can
a case of why ...

1223
01:15:14,934 --> 01:15:19,654
if they are left free in the future,
why are no longer a threat.

1224
01:15:19,934 --> 01:15:22,574
My client could
found to be innocent ...

1225
01:15:22,694 --> 01:15:25,854
in those courts,
but then the army believed ...

1226
01:15:25,974 --> 01:15:28,054
it does not sound very good,
to be declared ...

1227
01:15:28,174 --> 01:15:30,294
that are not
enemy combatants (NEC) ...

1228
01:15:30,414 --> 01:15:33,054
should be declared
NLEC which means ...

1229
01:15:33,094 --> 01:15:35,094
that are no longer
enemy combatants ...

1230
01:15:35,214 --> 01:15:38,774
because before they were guilty,
but now that has changed ...

1231
01:15:38,934 --> 01:15:41,854
so we are not guilty,
but we were right at first.

1232
01:15:41,934 --> 01:15:44,854
These men are not
necessarily innocent ...

1233
01:15:44,934 --> 01:15:47,934
is not an accurate description.

1234
01:15:48,054 --> 01:15:51,174
The more specific designation
is that we ...

1235
01:15:51,254 --> 01:15:54,854
are no longer enemy combatants.

1236
01:15:54,934 --> 01:15:59,374
They were separated from the rest of the
arrested for the government ...

1237
01:15:59,454 --> 01:16:03,294
U.S. is a country
to be passed.

1238
01:16:03,414 --> 01:16:05,894
Some of these types are
withdrew from the battlefield ...

1239
01:16:06,014 --> 01:16:09,534
and if not here,
will be there ...

1240
01:16:09,614 --> 01:16:12,094
killing soldiers
Americans.

1241
01:16:12,214 --> 01:16:14,774
If you are here is something
our mission is ...

1242
01:16:14,854 --> 01:16:17,494
to ensure that
remain here until ...

1243
01:16:17,574 --> 01:16:21,094
conclusion that no longer
should continue here.

1244
01:16:21,294 --> 01:16:24,134
Guantanamo serves
to hide the fact ...

1245
01:16:24,214 --> 01:16:26,694
that the real bad
Mullah Omar and of course ...

1246
01:16:26,774 --> 01:16:28,854
Osama Bin Laden,
have not been captured.

1247
01:16:28,934 --> 01:16:33,254
Guantanamo along with their
"Malis" 750 types ...

1248
01:16:33,374 --> 01:16:36,454
are just a
Image to say:

1249
01:16:36,614 --> 01:16:39,854
"Look, we're accomplishing something
in the fight against terrorism. "

1250
01:16:46,934 --> 01:16:50,054
THE TOUR FOR THE PRESS
IN GUANTANAMO.

1251
01:17:00,934 --> 01:17:03,174
And that is the main entrance
Camp X-Ray

1252
01:17:03,254 --> 01:17:05,934
It would be very hard to escape here.

1253
01:17:06,014 --> 01:17:08,454
CAMP X-RAY WAS
Abandoned in April 2002.

1254
01:17:08,534 --> 01:17:10,254
The cells measured
2.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 meters.

1255
01:17:10,374 --> 01:17:12,574
By an individual cell.

1256
01:17:13,174 --> 01:17:15,494
Will be remembered for
individuals with orange clothes ...

1257
01:17:15,614 --> 01:17:17,694
were three or four knees
and looking over there ...

1258
01:17:17,814 --> 01:17:19,654
three or four knees
and looking into further.

1259
01:17:19,774 --> 01:17:22,414
If you take photos from here
obtain the same image.

1260
01:17:23,374 --> 01:17:26,654
No detainee has died at
Guantanamo for nothing.

1261
01:17:26,774 --> 01:17:28,774
MISCELLANEOUS FROM THIS INTERVIEW
Detainees have committed suicide.

1262
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:30,894
Doctors will tell you that we have already
conducted over 100 operations ...

1263
01:17:30,974 --> 01:17:34,254
well, that's one advantage
to be here, to be healthy ...

1264
01:17:34,374 --> 01:17:36,534
and what they cure
to be curarles.

1265
01:17:43,774 --> 01:17:47,774
We have introduced new
sports here at Camp 4.

1266
01:17:47,894 --> 01:17:50,454
Recently assemble this
half basketball court.

1267
01:17:50,574 --> 01:17:53,854
And to the left of it
be a soccer field.

1268
01:17:53,934 --> 01:17:56,054
Living in Camp
4 is a privilege.

1269
01:17:56,094 --> 01:18:00,014
To live here have to abide
the rules of the camp.

1270
01:18:00,134 --> 01:18:03,974
And we've introduced things like
cake on Wednesday night ...

1271
01:18:04,054 --> 01:18:07,174
Pepsi on Monday night
ice cream on Sunday evening.

1272
01:18:07,414 --> 01:18:09,414
We will come to see the bed.

1273
01:18:09,934 --> 01:18:14,854
In bed with what they call
"comfort", which is ...

1274
01:18:14,974 --> 01:18:18,534
objects such as toothbrushes,
but also games of checkers.

1275
01:18:18,614 --> 01:18:21,014
And I asked: "And who is going
to play the ladies my client? "

1276
01:18:21,094 --> 01:18:23,854
It is only confined to
an isolation cell.

1277
01:18:25,734 --> 01:18:28,774
What problem is that
Press the pictures ...

1278
01:18:28,894 --> 01:18:31,134
talk to them, observe?

1279
01:18:31,454 --> 01:18:35,454
We do not want to give them a
means of expression.

1280
01:18:36,174 --> 01:18:39,014
We want to avoid that
detainees express their vile ...

1281
01:18:39,094 --> 01:18:44,454
Islamist arguments, its violent
and vile Islamic arguments.

1282
01:18:44,574 --> 01:18:49,254
Souvenir shop
OF GUANTANAMO.

1283
01:18:56,294 --> 01:18:58,774
It is a tactic of Al Qaeda.

1284
01:18:58,854 --> 01:19:00,934
Start hunger strikes to
attract media attention ...

1285
01:19:01,054 --> 01:19:03,054
81 detainees were strikers
HUNGER IN THIS JOURNEY.

1286
01:19:03,134 --> 01:19:05,094
and lobby the government
the USA.

1287
01:19:05,214 --> 01:19:07,174
When the number increased
significantly ...

1288
01:19:07,254 --> 01:19:11,094
You began to wonder
on the subject and they know it.

1289
01:19:11,934 --> 01:19:14,334
Camp 5 is a
isolation facilities ...

1290
01:19:14,414 --> 01:19:16,694
for maximum security
interviews with 100 beds.

1291
01:19:17,214 --> 01:19:20,294
If you are detained at Camp
5 days are always the same ...

1292
01:19:20,414 --> 01:19:24,974
and you spend 24 hours a
days alone in an isolation cell.

1293
01:19:26,214 --> 01:19:28,734
The two half-cell
and half by two meters.

1294
01:19:28,814 --> 01:19:32,374
I am unable to give three
steps in any direction.

1295
01:19:32,934 --> 01:19:36,094
I became convinced that would happen
Hence most of my life ...

1296
01:19:36,214 --> 01:19:40,374
and that perhaps I carried,
something told me often.

1297
01:19:40,454 --> 01:19:43,934
What especially pernicious
of Guantanamo Bay is ...

1298
01:19:44,094 --> 01:19:46,934
do not know when it will end,
not even know if it will.

1299
01:19:47,054 --> 01:19:50,694
The reason that the prisoners
on hunger strike ...

1300
01:19:50,774 --> 01:19:53,614
and die of starvation,
is that in the words of ...

1301
01:19:53,734 --> 01:19:57,534
Omar Deghayes: "Since I am
slowly dying in here ...

1302
01:19:57,614 --> 01:20:01,254
Guantánamo, at least they can
have my own life. "

1303
01:20:01,374 --> 01:20:04,734
INTERROGATION ROOM.

1304
01:20:05,614 --> 01:20:08,454
I have no intention whatsoever
to detain anyone here that ...

1305
01:20:08,534 --> 01:20:10,934
is no longer a threat
for our country ...

1306
01:20:11,014 --> 01:20:14,214
or unable to give information
useful in the war ...

1307
01:20:14,334 --> 01:20:17,414
against terrorism.
Collect data yet ...

1308
01:20:17,494 --> 01:20:20,374
of men
We locked.

1309
01:20:25,094 --> 01:20:27,734
One of the reasons that I
isolated were related ...

1310
01:20:27,814 --> 01:20:31,614
with the fact of having witnessed
of the deaths at Bagram.

1311
01:20:31,694 --> 01:20:34,894
I wonder what soldiers
had been involved ...

1312
01:20:35,014 --> 01:20:38,214
so I brought in pictures
of people in the unit ...

1313
01:20:38,254 --> 01:20:42,054
and indicated that they believed
who were involved.

1314
01:20:42,094 --> 01:20:45,214
I asked one of the things
more strange that I never ...

1315
01:20:45,254 --> 01:20:48,174
asked all the time
I was imprisoned.

1316
01:20:48,254 --> 01:20:54,254
And if he was willing to testify
in the trial of those soldiers.

1317
01:20:54,294 --> 01:20:56,854
And I thought:
"How ironic is this ...

1318
01:20:56,934 --> 01:20:59,414
That is the only court
get to see ...

1319
01:20:59,454 --> 01:21:02,094
after all these
years of captivity. "

1320
01:21:03,214 --> 01:21:07,774
THE RULE OF LAW.

1321
01:21:09,414 --> 01:21:12,094
The cruel ironies of
the story of Dilawar ...

1322
01:21:12,174 --> 01:21:15,294
echoed in a debate without end
the U.S. Congress ...

1323
01:21:15,374 --> 01:21:18,214
on abuses of detainees,
national security ...

1324
01:21:18,294 --> 01:21:20,174
and the rule of law.

1325
01:21:20,214 --> 01:21:24,094
To a senator, John McCain,
former prisoner of war ...

1326
01:21:24,174 --> 01:21:28,574
the abuse of prisoners
was both political and personal.

1327
01:21:29,094 --> 01:21:31,614
NORTH VIETNAM, 1968.

1328
01:21:31,734 --> 01:21:34,454
I want to say ...

1329
01:21:38,094 --> 01:21:44,614
my wife,
that I will be fine.

1330
01:21:46,454 --> 01:21:53,054
I love her and that
See you again soon.

1331
01:21:53,094 --> 01:21:57,894
I would like
being told.

1332
01:21:59,854 --> 01:22:02,534
That's it.

1333
01:22:03,134 --> 01:22:07,894
If this man, after
six or seven years of torture ...

1334
01:22:07,974 --> 01:22:12,574
said that it is not effective,
it is inhumane ...

1335
01:22:12,694 --> 01:22:16,974
and feeding
contempt towards the U.S..

1336
01:22:17,294 --> 01:22:21,974
He could stand up and be the voice
of morality in this matter.

1337
01:22:22,054 --> 01:22:25,294
Send to fight for
us to Afghanistan and Iraq.

1338
01:22:25,414 --> 01:22:30,774
The push to raise
information from detainees ...

1339
01:22:30,854 --> 01:22:34,294
pero luego obviamos las reglas con las
we train our soldiers ...

1340
01:22:34,414 --> 01:22:39,454
and replaced by a set
changing rules and confusing.

1341
01:22:39,574 --> 01:22:44,014
And when things were bad,
I miss the guilt and punishment.

1342
01:22:45,454 --> 01:22:47,774
I think we can
do better than that.

1343
01:22:49,734 --> 01:22:52,774
I strongly urge you to
do justice to your men ...

1344
01:22:52,854 --> 01:22:57,774
and women in uniform, to give rules
of conduct that reflect ...

1345
01:22:57,894 --> 01:23:01,374
the ideals for
who risk their lives.

1346
01:23:04,374 --> 01:23:07,174
On October 5, 2005
because every time ...

1347
01:23:07,294 --> 01:23:10,214
came more cases of abuse
detainees to the courts ...

1348
01:23:10,334 --> 01:23:15,054
Senator John McCain proposed the
"Detainee Treatment Act."

1349
01:23:15,894 --> 01:23:19,014
The Act sought to abolish a
of torture by the U.S..

1350
01:23:19,094 --> 01:23:22,374
As well as cruel,
inhuman and degrading.

1351
01:23:22,454 --> 01:23:28,534
And prompted a national debate,
plagued by a vicious details.

1352
01:23:28,654 --> 01:23:31,854
Is it still permissible
using a wet towel ...

1353
01:23:31,934 --> 01:23:36,094
and water to induce a
misperception of suffocation?

1354
01:23:36,214 --> 01:23:38,614
The use of wet towel
and water to induce ...

1355
01:23:38,774 --> 01:23:40,774
misperception
Choking was a ...

1356
01:23:40,894 --> 01:23:44,854
the methods applied
by the detachment ...

1357
01:23:44,934 --> 01:23:47,934
Guantanamo in its long
list. Never adopted.

1358
01:23:48,054 --> 01:23:50,534
It has never been a
technique adopted.

1359
01:23:50,894 --> 01:23:53,054
One technique that
made the transition ...

1360
01:23:53,094 --> 01:23:56,534
the scope
physical to psychological ...

1361
01:23:56,614 --> 01:23:58,854
in fact, the only
was "waterboarding."

1362
01:23:58,934 --> 01:24:01,654
Because in the Middle Ages,
times of the Inquisition ...

1363
01:24:01,774 --> 01:24:05,774
was used for its
terrible physics ...

1364
01:24:05,854 --> 01:24:08,734
was used to purge
and punish the heretic.

1365
01:24:08,854 --> 01:24:11,574
Water is introduced by the
throat to force ...

1366
01:24:11,694 --> 01:24:14,574
cree that the victim is
drowning, it's frightening.

1367
01:24:14,654 --> 01:24:17,414
You have the feeling that die.

1368
01:24:18,734 --> 01:24:21,574
Right after 9 / 11,
The CIA obtained the approval ...

1369
01:24:21,694 --> 01:24:23,734
the White House
use the "waterboarding".

1370
01:24:24,894 --> 01:24:26,774
One of the first
Where was tested ...

1371
01:24:26,894 --> 01:24:28,854
was in the interrogation
Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi ...

1372
01:24:28,974 --> 01:24:32,774
alleged emir of a camp
Al Qaeda training.

1373
01:24:33,614 --> 01:24:36,934
Initially the FBI was responsible
his interrogation ...

1374
01:24:37,094 --> 01:24:39,454
but the administration is
impatient with the slow ...

1375
01:24:39,614 --> 01:24:42,574
that results obtained
techniques of the FBI.

1376
01:24:42,614 --> 01:24:45,534
So given
al-Libi to the CIA.

1377
01:24:45,614 --> 01:24:48,894
Was immobilized,
bound with a ribbon ...

1378
01:24:49,014 --> 01:24:51,734
hooded and iban
get a box ...

1379
01:24:51,774 --> 01:24:56,094
plywood box
for their own safety ...

1380
01:24:56,254 --> 01:24:58,454
during their transfer to the airport.

1381
01:24:58,574 --> 01:25:04,334
I boarded a plane and
sent to Egypt in an illegal flight.

1382
01:25:05,654 --> 01:25:09,094
Then during the two weeks
subjected to brutal torture ...

1383
01:25:09,214 --> 01:25:12,214
through all these techniques,
including the "waterboarding".

1384
01:25:13,254 --> 01:25:17,574
And what came from al-Libi was
that the regime of Saddam Hussein ...

1385
01:25:17,694 --> 01:25:22,054
had trained in Al Qaeda
methods of chemical and biological warfare.

1386
01:25:22,294 --> 01:25:27,814
One of the things we know about
torture is that torture ...

1387
01:25:27,934 --> 01:25:35,014
someone will say to his interrogator
cree what he wants to hear.

1388
01:25:35,094 --> 01:25:37,614
At the time when
he applied the "waterboarding" ...

1389
01:25:37,774 --> 01:25:39,934
al-Libi began
speak clearly.

1390
01:25:40,054 --> 01:25:44,854
But instead of questioning what
read and consider carefully ...

1391
01:25:44,934 --> 01:25:47,174
to see if what she said
could be substantiated ...

1392
01:25:47,254 --> 01:25:49,094
left immediately.

1393
01:25:49,214 --> 01:25:54,254
Rushed to inform you that al-Libi
had said and left the torture.

1394
01:25:54,374 --> 01:25:57,094
And "bang", what comes to the
highest ...

1395
01:25:57,214 --> 01:25:59,014
and suddenly it
Colin Powell says:

1396
01:25:59,094 --> 01:26:02,494
"Hey, no longer must worry
his doubts, because ...

1397
01:26:02,574 --> 01:26:07,654
just confirm that there was
contacts between Al Qaeda and Baghdad. "

1398
01:26:09,054 --> 01:26:13,494
In February 2003, the then
Secretary of State Colin Powell ...

1399
01:26:13,574 --> 01:26:18,134
appeared before the UN
advocating the invasion of Iraq.

1400
01:26:18,214 --> 01:26:22,614
I can recount the history of
as a major terrorist ...

1401
01:26:22,694 --> 01:26:26,974
that Iraq trained Al Qaeda
in the use of these weapons.

1402
01:26:27,094 --> 01:26:32,214
Fortunately, this is a terrorist
arrested and had their history.

1403
01:26:32,894 --> 01:26:36,854
A year later the CIA
accused al-Libi ...

1404
01:26:36,934 --> 01:26:39,774
distort information and invalidated
all reports ...

1405
01:26:39,894 --> 01:26:42,214
intelligence services
with that information.

1406
01:26:42,294 --> 01:26:46,414
That is, get information,
but false information.

1407
01:26:46,454 --> 01:26:51,854
I think Colin Powell said he had
been the most embarrassing days of his life.

1408
01:26:55,934 --> 01:26:59,054
According to all experts,
the torturing people ...

1409
01:26:59,094 --> 01:27:02,334
is not the best way
to obtain information.

1410
01:27:03,134 --> 01:27:07,854
Breaking down barriers
between you and them ...

1411
01:27:07,934 --> 01:27:11,334
earn your trust,
is the best way to achieve it.

1412
01:27:11,454 --> 01:27:15,494
Experience is needed,
true talent, a little patience ...

1413
01:27:15,574 --> 01:27:19,134
and maybe you say something
worthwhile.

1414
01:27:19,214 --> 01:27:22,454
And then, if they
should run ahead.

1415
01:27:22,894 --> 01:27:25,734
If you want to understand
well with someone ...

1416
01:27:25,934 --> 01:27:27,414
JACK CLOONAN.
FBI agents 1977-2002.

1417
01:27:27,534 --> 01:27:31,374
must be your salvation, because his life
as we know, is over.

1418
01:27:32,774 --> 01:27:35,934
Can I do something for your kids?
Are you concerned about them?

1419
01:27:36,534 --> 01:27:39,214
Want to education?
I will give you education.

1420
01:27:40,734 --> 01:27:43,214
What do you want?
Tell me what you want ...

1421
01:27:43,934 --> 01:27:47,094
Tell me how
think out of this.

1422
01:27:47,254 --> 01:27:49,774
How are you going to wage
of this so ...

1423
01:27:49,854 --> 01:27:53,414
terrible in which, for
Incidentally, you got yourself?

1424
01:27:53,894 --> 01:27:59,414
You can not go home, right?
Not so good ... llevémonos

1425
01:27:59,534 --> 01:28:04,014
let it help you to find a
strategy to get a life.

1426
01:28:05,654 --> 01:28:07,694
And this is how it works.

1427
01:28:07,814 --> 01:28:13,174
The amount of information
obtained before 9 / 11 ...

1428
01:28:13,294 --> 01:28:15,974
for me it was valuable.

1429
01:28:16,094 --> 01:28:20,654
Who else would tell us
how to come to Al Qaeda?

1430
01:28:20,774 --> 01:28:24,854
What it meant "Billah"?
How do they communicate?

1431
01:28:24,974 --> 01:28:29,374
What used satellite phones?
What Bin Laden had a double?

1432
01:28:29,494 --> 01:28:34,534
And get all this information,
were able to perform certain operations.

1433
01:28:34,614 --> 01:28:39,614
As boring as it may seem, for
me remains the best method.

1434
01:28:39,734 --> 01:28:43,094
And we do not have to ask
Apologies to anyone.

1435
01:28:44,454 --> 01:28:47,574
We do not know what revenge
us.

1436
01:28:47,774 --> 01:28:50,614
And if I wanted to encourage
the believers ...

1437
01:28:50,734 --> 01:28:53,414
would take a
those with photo of the necklace ...

1438
01:28:53,534 --> 01:28:56,254
dog, report,
and watch his brothers ...

1439
01:28:56,254 --> 01:28:59,294
children and say:
"They have a duty to take revenge."

1440
01:29:01,174 --> 01:29:04,254
LA BOMBA DE TIEMPO.

1441
01:29:04,574 --> 01:29:08,934
Advocates of torture
tend to focus on the hypothetical.

1442
01:29:09,014 --> 01:29:11,854
They talk about the impending explosion
a time bomb.

1443
01:29:11,934 --> 01:29:15,414
Imagine that there is a
bomb in Times Square ...

1444
01:29:15,494 --> 01:29:19,534
which is about to erupt, we
custody to a lawyer type and want to ...

1445
01:29:20,214 --> 01:29:22,854
Does it respect the right
A lawyer or to save ...

1446
01:29:22,934 --> 01:29:26,494
a million lives we will apply
electrodes to his testicles?

1447
01:29:32,774 --> 01:29:38,934
In the series "24", week after week
are scenes of horrific torture.

1448
01:29:39,014 --> 01:29:41,094
Tell me what you regard
with terrorists.

1449
01:29:41,214 --> 01:29:43,694
Its intention is to prevent any
a terrorist bomb ...

1450
01:29:43,774 --> 01:29:47,934
time kills hundreds of thousands
but millions of Americans.

1451
01:29:48,054 --> 01:29:49,454
Are we torturing
this man?

1452
01:29:49,614 --> 01:29:51,614
I say do what
necessary to avoid ...

1453
01:29:51,694 --> 01:29:53,254
that the nuclear warhead
used against us.

1454
01:29:53,374 --> 01:29:55,214
It is merely an absurd,
because you can tell them:

1455
01:29:55,254 --> 01:29:57,534
"Hey, cítame
one time ...

1456
01:29:57,614 --> 01:29:59,934
the last 500 years
we've had in ...

1457
01:30:00,054 --> 01:30:01,974
arrested someone
a time bomb. "

1458
01:30:02,094 --> 01:30:07,694
The probability that
happen, is remotísima.

1459
01:30:07,774 --> 01:30:11,414
And although the case, who you
ensures that knocking ...

1460
01:30:11,534 --> 01:30:15,054
you'll get the information?
If a guy is as committed ...

1461
01:30:15,134 --> 01:30:18,014
I think it will die before giving.

1462
01:30:18,374 --> 01:30:20,134
Just after the
appearance of the pictures ...

1463
01:30:20,214 --> 01:30:23,214
Abu Ghraib in mid
2004, 35% of ...

1464
01:30:23,294 --> 01:30:25,494
U.S. respondents,
believed that torture ...

1465
01:30:25,574 --> 01:30:28,134
was acceptable
certain circumstances.

1466
01:30:28,414 --> 01:30:32,054
Even after the photos of Abu
Ghraib, and I think this shows ...

1467
01:30:32,174 --> 01:30:36,894
that this kind of popular culture
causes an endorsement of torture ...

1468
01:30:37,014 --> 01:30:40,934
which allows the White House
Bush is getting his own way when ...

1469
01:30:41,094 --> 01:30:46,014
distorted the laws and treaties
without outraged public opinion.

1470
01:30:47,174 --> 01:30:50,014
In a radio trend
conservative, the vice president ...

1471
01:30:50,094 --> 01:30:54,214
Dick Cheney defended without any detour
the practice of "waterboarding."

1472
01:30:54,454 --> 01:30:57,854
Do not you think that "waterboarding" is not
must question whether lives are saved?

1473
01:30:57,934 --> 01:31:02,854
Well, I do not question it,
but during a time ...

1474
01:31:02,974 --> 01:31:06,054
criticized me for being the
"vice president for torture."

1475
01:31:07,614 --> 01:31:09,534
Do not forgive torture.

1476
01:31:09,734 --> 01:31:12,934
"We do not torture", footnote
page, according to our definition ...

1477
01:31:13,014 --> 01:31:16,694
means of torture which
appears to us and nothing else.

1478
01:31:17,574 --> 01:31:22,174
In the election campaign of 2006,
Bush defended the administration ...

1479
01:31:22,214 --> 01:31:26,214
the brutal methods that the rest
the world defined as "torture."

1480
01:31:26,694 --> 01:31:30,174
Bush and Cheney played the fear
of voters and politicians.

1481
01:31:30,494 --> 01:31:34,614
If Congress gave them no power
to do what was necessary ...

1482
01:31:34,774 --> 01:31:37,294
How to be iban
except the Americans?

1483
01:31:37,454 --> 01:31:40,454
In addition to the terrorists
Guantanamo ...

1484
01:31:40,574 --> 01:31:42,574
a small group
suspected leaders of ...

1485
01:31:42,694 --> 01:31:44,614
and terrorist activities
arrested in the war ...

1486
01:31:44,774 --> 01:31:48,614
have been captured and
questioned outside the USA.

1487
01:31:50,014 --> 01:31:53,614
In a separate program run by
Central Intelligence Agency.

1488
01:31:53,934 --> 01:31:55,614
The CIA program included:

1489
01:31:55,734 --> 01:31:57,774
Some people question, "Why recognizes
Now the program?

1490
01:31:57,934 --> 01:32:00,574
Waterboarding,
Forced nudity ...

1491
01:32:00,654 --> 01:32:02,494
Some believe that the military
and intelligence personnel ...

1492
01:32:02,614 --> 01:32:04,854
involved in capturing and
interrogation of terrorists ...

1493
01:32:04,974 --> 01:32:06,134
PLANTS BOUND
(MORE THAN 40 HOURS)

1494
01:32:06,214 --> 01:32:10,414
now could be at risk of
be accused of war crimes ...

1495
01:32:10,534 --> 01:32:14,534
simply for doing their jobs
conscious and professional manner.

1496
01:32:15,174 --> 01:32:17,214
This is unacceptable.

1497
01:32:17,974 --> 01:32:20,214
President Bush was
forced to reveal ...

1498
01:32:20,374 --> 01:32:23,054
the secret CIA program
when the Supreme Court ...

1499
01:32:23,134 --> 01:32:25,814
intervened to limit its
powers in wartime.

1500
01:32:25,894 --> 01:32:29,014
Hamdan's historic decision,
The Supreme Court concluded that ...

1501
01:32:29,134 --> 01:32:31,814
interviews and
processes of terrorists ...

1502
01:32:31,894 --> 01:32:34,614
be subject to
Geneva Convention.

1503
01:32:34,934 --> 01:32:38,214
This debate has
because the failure ...

1504
01:32:38,294 --> 01:32:41,734
Supreme Court
says that we must act ...

1505
01:32:41,774 --> 01:32:45,254
under Common Article 3
of the Geneva Convention.

1506
01:32:47,174 --> 01:32:52,534
And the Common Article 3 says that no
infringe upon human dignity.

1507
01:32:54,214 --> 01:32:58,534
That's ... is ... is, I do not know
very vague. What does it mean?

1508
01:33:03,454 --> 01:33:07,014
Do you think the use of
evidence obtained through ...

1509
01:33:07,094 --> 01:33:11,014
techniques such as waterboarding,
stress positions, jobs ...

1510
01:33:11,094 --> 01:33:13,854
intimidatory dogs
military, sleep deprivation ...

1511
01:33:13,974 --> 01:33:18,934
and sensory, forced nudity
no common Article 3 attacks?

1512
01:33:20,094 --> 01:33:22,174
Lord, I believe that the most
important is that I can not ...

1513
01:33:22,214 --> 01:33:25,134
imagine that such testimony
can be trusted.

1514
01:33:25,214 --> 01:33:27,494
Mr. Attorney General, cree
that data from ...

1515
01:33:27,574 --> 01:33:31,294
through an unlawful treatment
and inhuman treatment to be admitted?

1516
01:33:44,214 --> 01:33:45,934
Senator, I ...

1517
01:33:48,534 --> 01:33:52,094
Well, again ...
I will say this ...

1518
01:33:52,214 --> 01:33:56,254
I am concerned
of such a ban ...

1519
01:33:56,454 --> 01:33:58,694
is: what does that mean?
How do you define?

1520
01:33:59,294 --> 01:34:01,374
And who would define it?

1521
01:34:01,494 --> 01:34:03,894
The Bush administration
introduced a new law ...

1522
01:34:04,014 --> 01:34:07,574
to circumvent the restrictions
Supreme Court.

1523
01:34:07,694 --> 01:34:10,374
In a legal sense,
I think they wanted to eliminate ...

1524
01:34:10,494 --> 01:34:13,254
the Constitution
and rewritten.

1525
01:34:13,334 --> 01:34:15,374
But you can not do that,
so what do ...

1526
01:34:15,494 --> 01:34:17,574
is to provide a new
interpretation of the former.

1527
01:34:17,694 --> 01:34:20,214
The new interpretation
is that the Executive ...

1528
01:34:20,294 --> 01:34:23,734
in time of war and maybe
this war will last forever ...

1529
01:34:23,854 --> 01:34:26,214
is almighty.

1530
01:34:27,214 --> 01:34:30,734
Congress gave the president
more than they wanted.

1531
01:34:30,854 --> 01:34:33,894
Agree to abide by
the Geneva Convention ...

1532
01:34:33,934 --> 01:34:37,774
provided they could define
its meaning and application.

1533
01:34:38,454 --> 01:34:42,294
A few prisoners
Guantanamo would be tried ...

1534
01:34:42,414 --> 01:34:46,094
but the rest would never
access to habeas corpus.

1535
01:34:46,254 --> 01:34:50,454
The fundamental legal right
to challenge their detention.

1536
01:34:52,454 --> 01:34:54,774
Thinking submitted
the presidential election ...

1537
01:34:54,894 --> 01:34:57,254
to Senator McCain
voted for the law ...

1538
01:34:57,374 --> 01:34:59,614
shortly after the
Bush administration threatens ...

1539
01:34:59,694 --> 01:35:02,614
to discredit him with
Conservatives votes.

1540
01:35:03,334 --> 01:35:05,894
Very hidden within this law ...

1541
01:35:05,974 --> 01:35:08,814
There is a provision
forgive President Bush ...

1542
01:35:08,934 --> 01:35:11,174
and all members of
administration of all ...

1543
01:35:11,254 --> 01:35:14,054
possible crimes
torture-related ...

1544
01:35:14,134 --> 01:35:19,374
and abuse of prisoners
since September 11 2001.

1545
01:35:19,454 --> 01:35:22,374
At least Nixon had Gerald Ford
to do the dirty work.

1546
01:35:22,494 --> 01:35:25,454
President Bush tries
forgive himself.

1547
01:35:26,814 --> 01:35:31,694
Forgiveness is not extended
to soldiers in battle.

1548
01:35:31,814 --> 01:35:34,614
The trial was a time
very confusing to me ...

1549
01:35:34,694 --> 01:35:38,934
had never been in one,
I did not know what was going on.

1550
01:35:39,534 --> 01:35:42,454
All that is included
I faced a long ...

1551
01:35:42,534 --> 01:35:45,294
conviction, that is the only thing
I understood everything.

1552
01:35:45,414 --> 01:35:47,294
WILLIE SOLDIER BRAND
CONVICTED BY:

1553
01:35:47,454 --> 01:35:49,094
ASSAULT, mutilation
AND ABUSE.

1554
01:35:49,214 --> 01:35:51,454
They put me in jail ...

1555
01:35:51,614 --> 01:35:54,254
a corrective to the army.

1556
01:35:54,374 --> 01:35:56,254
SGT. Anthony Morden
GUILTY OF: ASSAULT AND NEGLECT.

1557
01:35:56,294 --> 01:35:58,694
I lost my job ...

1558
01:35:59,094 --> 01:36:01,734
I was low
for misconduct ...

1559
01:36:01,854 --> 01:36:07,214
I am prevented from getting
work in the same field.

1560
01:36:11,414 --> 01:36:15,054
I have been financially devastated.

1561
01:36:15,134 --> 01:36:18,414
Glad you have finished
and be able to continue with my life.

1562
01:36:18,534 --> 01:36:20,294
DAMIEN CORSETTI SOLDADO
ACQUITTED OF:

1563
01:36:20,414 --> 01:36:22,974
ASSAULT, ABUSE, USE
Of hashish and IMPROPER ACT.

1564
01:36:23,054 --> 01:36:29,614
GLENDALE WALLS SPECIALIST
I should plead guilty to:
assault and two counts of negligence.

1565
01:36:29,734 --> 01:36:34,934
I was told that a change does not happen
more than four months in jail.

1566
01:36:36,254 --> 01:36:40,774
Instead of spending money on a
view, would have invested ...

1567
01:36:40,934 --> 01:36:43,614
better training for soldiers
and ensure that other people ...

1568
01:36:43,734 --> 01:36:49,454
enters into battle well equipped,
directed and understanding ...

1569
01:36:49,574 --> 01:36:53,014
quite new
rules and responsibilities.

1570
01:36:55,734 --> 01:36:59,934
When a prisoner is abused,
or a detainee alleges abuse ...

1571
01:37:00,054 --> 01:37:02,654
want someone
pay for the damage.

1572
01:37:02,774 --> 01:37:07,614
And there are people who have
eagles or stars on the sleeves.

1573
01:37:07,894 --> 01:37:12,214
No official has been
If convicted of Dilawar.

1574
01:37:12,654 --> 01:37:16,094
Following his service at Abu Ghraib,
the Captain Carolyn Wood ...

1575
01:37:16,174 --> 01:37:20,214
was assigned to the School of
Interrogation of the Army ...

1576
01:37:20,294 --> 01:37:22,854
Fort Huachuca, Arizona.

1577
01:37:22,934 --> 01:37:25,614
And what it reflects on ...

1578
01:37:25,694 --> 01:37:29,054
the intentions
of senior executives?

1579
01:37:29,174 --> 01:37:32,454
Not eradicate abuse ...

1580
01:37:32,574 --> 01:37:36,174
but the perpetuation of abuse.

1581
01:37:36,254 --> 01:37:38,934
I think there is a possibility
other terrorist attacks ...

1582
01:37:39,014 --> 01:37:41,094
of dying
more Americans.

1583
01:37:41,214 --> 01:37:44,214
And the argument that we should
abuse of detainees ...

1584
01:37:44,294 --> 01:37:46,054
to protect lives
Americans ...

1585
01:37:46,094 --> 01:37:49,254
I believe violates
our values rooted ...

1586
01:37:49,374 --> 01:37:52,214
and against its own
security of our country.

1587
01:37:52,294 --> 01:37:54,574
Not only strive
to protect lives ...

1588
01:37:54,614 --> 01:37:56,894
fight to protect
our principles.

1589
01:37:56,934 --> 01:38:01,134
If I say that Afghanistan,
Guantanamo and Iraq ...

1590
01:38:01,254 --> 01:38:03,614
We have caught 50 thousand
people, I would say ...

1591
01:38:03,694 --> 01:38:05,854
less than 1% were terrorists.

1592
01:38:05,974 --> 01:38:09,534
FROM 11 SEPT 2006
ARE MORE THAN 83 THOUSAND PRISONERS.

1593
01:38:10,014 --> 01:38:13,054
None have been
Brought to trial.

1594
01:38:13,174 --> 01:38:16,214
Some were insurgents?
Possibly.

1595
01:38:16,294 --> 01:38:19,894
Will all of Iraq
to become insurgents ...

1596
01:38:19,974 --> 01:38:22,614
after the treatment?
Sure.

1597
01:38:22,694 --> 01:38:26,094
I was kidnapped, imprisoned me
unfairly, I was tortured ...

1598
01:38:26,174 --> 01:38:30,814
and threatened me with more
torture, without charge, without trial.

1599
01:38:30,894 --> 01:38:33,294
Released by Moazzam Begg
PRESSURE OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT.

1600
01:38:33,454 --> 01:38:35,854
Many soldiers
I said then:

1601
01:38:35,854 --> 01:38:38,734
"Hell, if you were not
terrorist when you came ...

1602
01:38:38,854 --> 01:38:42,734
when you leave you will be safe,
by how they treat you. "

1603
01:38:45,614 --> 01:38:48,774
I think there are
certain prejudices ...

1604
01:38:48,894 --> 01:38:54,254
that this religion and people
who hijacked the planes ...

1605
01:38:54,374 --> 01:38:57,414
just feels so
respect for life ...

1606
01:38:57,534 --> 01:38:59,574
that we look and say:

1607
01:38:59,694 --> 01:39:02,174
"if you have life
in such low esteem '...

1608
01:39:02,254 --> 01:39:05,454
is clear that the 11 / 9
is an example of this ...

1609
01:39:05,534 --> 01:39:09,974
"they are the devil
Here anything goes. "

1610
01:39:13,974 --> 01:39:18,014
Villagers come
the tomb of Dilawar ...

1611
01:39:18,134 --> 01:39:21,494
to pray for
his soul already departed.

1612
01:39:21,614 --> 01:39:26,774
I pray for him and for all
others are in the cemetery.

1613
01:39:27,134 --> 01:39:30,974
"Dilawar, the martyr"
VILLAGE OF YAKUBI.

1614
01:39:34,094 --> 01:39:37,614
BROTHER OF Dilawar.
What would you say to
Americans?

1615
01:39:37,734 --> 01:39:40,094
My brother was innocent.

1616
01:39:40,254 --> 01:39:43,574
It was almost a boy and killed him.

1617
01:39:43,694 --> 01:39:46,094
Since he died,
I can not taste the tea.

1618
01:39:46,214 --> 01:39:50,774
I can not taste food.
I can not prove anything.

1619
01:39:51,534 --> 01:39:55,374
Imagine coming out of here and
someone kills him on the road.

1620
01:39:55,454 --> 01:39:58,934
In what state would be
his children and his wife?

1621
01:39:59,054 --> 01:40:01,374
How would he feel his father?

1622
01:40:03,574 --> 01:40:07,974
Not surprisingly, the
end of all this ...

1623
01:40:08,054 --> 01:40:11,254
Dilawar, the victim,
been forgotten.

1624
01:40:11,334 --> 01:40:14,774
Dilawar was almost invisible
during trials.

1625
01:40:14,894 --> 01:40:18,894
Never saw pictures yours,
no one ever mentioned the ...

1626
01:40:18,974 --> 01:40:22,694
women and children who stayed
without husband and father.

1627
01:40:23,894 --> 01:40:26,454
You will not be took
account at all.

1628
01:40:27,614 --> 01:40:30,574
Dilawar was unable to work
in the field ...

1629
01:40:30,654 --> 01:40:34,934
so I said:
"Drive taxi ...

1630
01:40:35,094 --> 01:40:39,214
and bring meat and potatoes
the family at night. "

1631
01:40:42,294 --> 01:40:44,854
There are many people out there that ...

1632
01:40:44,934 --> 01:40:49,934
fall into the same system
if not resolved.

1633
01:40:50,014 --> 01:40:57,454
And you only need one case for
remind you of what is capable.

1634
01:41:18,054 --> 01:41:20,614
American values
are based on the concepts ...

1635
01:41:20,734 --> 01:41:24,294
of human dignity and
the sacredness of the individual.

1636
01:41:24,414 --> 01:41:29,694
Allowing the use of the
cruelty of an officially ...

1637
01:41:29,774 --> 01:41:31,894
tantamount to saying that
parents of our homeland ...

1638
01:41:31,974 --> 01:41:35,614
were wrong on
those inalienable rights.

1639
01:41:36,774 --> 01:41:39,094
Obviously Americans
we believe that ...

1640
01:41:39,254 --> 01:41:41,774
somehow it is our moral
higher than the rest of the world ...

1641
01:41:41,934 --> 01:41:44,934
and for whatever reason,
We have a strong desire to believe.

1642
01:41:45,054 --> 01:41:48,614
And the truth is I do not know
what the consequences will bring us ...

1643
01:41:48,734 --> 01:41:54,054
and I think that many people
decided that after ...

1644
01:41:54,094 --> 01:41:58,934
9 / 11 and everything is different
we can no longer be good ...

1645
01:41:59,094 --> 01:42:01,054
we have to be tough.

1646
01:42:01,174 --> 01:42:05,214
- And let's see what results from that.
- What do you think?

1647
01:42:05,414 --> 01:42:07,934
I think that is nonsense.

1648
01:42:08,014 --> 01:42:13,934
I think we should keep trying
be the best you can.

1649
01:42:23,774 --> 01:42:28,014
DEDICATED TO MY FATHER
FRANK B. Gibney. 1924 to 2005.

1650
01:42:28,134 --> 01:42:32,254
I find it totally inconceivable
that the highest authorities ...

1651
01:42:32,374 --> 01:42:37,414
Rumsfeld, Bush and Cheney,
not only tolerate torture ...

1652
01:42:37,454 --> 01:42:40,934
but also
advocate it.

1653
01:42:41,854 --> 01:42:44,774
The truth is that it destroyed my
faith in the U.S. government.

1654
01:42:45,614 --> 01:42:48,774
Because during the Second
World War and the Korean ...

1655
01:42:48,894 --> 01:42:50,854
in which I served well,
I had the feeling ...

1656
01:42:50,934 --> 01:42:54,294
be on the side
of the good guys.

1657
01:42:55,414 --> 01:42:58,574
That justice was always
in the United States of America.

1658
01:42:59,174 --> 01:43:03,934
That people receiving treatment
decent and law prevailed.

1659
01:43:04,134 --> 01:43:09,894
Never forget that behind the facade
hate the war ...

1660
01:43:10,014 --> 01:43:15,534
had a rule of law
that people follow.

1661
01:43:16,294 --> 01:43:17,854
It was something we thought.

1662
01:43:17,974 --> 01:43:20,734
It was what made the
United States differently.
