I wove that led to my downfall.

480
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:38,911
By "lamb" I meant "girl."

What do you eat, Bill,
since you don't eat meat?

957

Good God,
give it a rest, will you?

958
00:50:38,936 --> 00:50:40,171
Do you eat rice,

959
00:50:40,238 --> 00:50:42,140
do you eat broccoli,
do you eat vegetables?

960
00:50:42,207 --> 00:50:45,110
What exactly is it
that gives you your power?

961
00:50:48,213 --> 00:50:49,714
Spinach.

962
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:52,817
(GASPS) Spinach?

963
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,985
Yes, spinach.

You know, my arms blow up,
I toot my pipe.

take it up the ass.

You're talking my language.

967
00:51:02,026 --> 00:51:03,961
Why is it okay to eat spinach?

968
00:51:04,028 --> 00:51:05,863
It's a plant,
or a bush or something.

969
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:08,766
It's not a conscious being
with a conscious life.

970
00:51:08,833 --> 00:51:11,536
Then why do they move
toward the sun?

971
00:51:11,602 --> 00:51:13,371
It's warm and
that's how they grow.

972
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:16,374
Well, but how do they do that?

973
00:51:16,441 --> 00:51:19,977
These plants you gobble up with
such a clear conscience...

974
00:51:20,044 --> 00:51:23,047
how do they know to do that
if they have no consciousness?

975
00:51:23,114 --> 00:51:25,082
Because that's how God
made the earth.

976
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:28,819
They are programmed to grow, so
that we have something to eat.

977
00:51:28,886 --> 00:51:30,888
So we don't have to eat animals.

978
00:51:30,955 --> 00:51:32,590
But animals kill
other animals and

979
00:51:32,657 --> 00:51:34,325
don't think twice
about eating them.

980
00:51:34,392 --> 00:51:36,026
How does your God
feel about that?

981
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:38,363
That's different,
they're animals,

982
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,765
they don't know any better.
God forgives them.

983
00:51:40,831 --> 00:51:43,468
Well, if animals are
so goddamn stupid and cruel,

984
00:51:43,534 --> 00:51:45,403
why not just eat them...

985
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:47,630
and get rid of the useless
bastards once and for all?

986

Why not rid the earth
of every single...

to understand?

989
00:51:55,045 --> 00:51:58,949
Look, I don't want to play any
more of your goddamn mind games.

990
00:51:59,016 --> 00:52:01,952
Is that what your God intended
when he created ice, Bill?

991
00:52:02,019 --> 00:52:04,755
Was it made for you and your
eye and for the swelling?

992
00:52:04,822 --> 00:52:06,791
Was it for you?

993
00:52:06,857 --> 00:52:10,027
God made it for me so that I could
do whatever the hell I want.

994
00:52:10,094 --> 00:52:12,497
So why don't you give me
some fucking ice?

995
00:52:12,563 --> 00:52:14,499
I'll just get it myself.

996
00:52:14,565 --> 00:52:17,335
So it is foretold,
the ice man cometh.

997
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:23,308
There's no ice. Where's the ice?

There is no ice, Bill. (GASPS)

your God has deserted you...

because of your
meat-eating lust for flesh?

1001

Well, who was he?
What did he do?

1059

1592
01:30:14,209 --> 01:30:15,778
You make me sick.

1593
01:30:17,112 --> 01:30:18,413
Stop.

1594
01:30:18,481 --> 01:30:19,548
Johnny.

1595
01:30:19,615 --> 01:30:21,617
(SCREAMING)

1596
01:30:24,453 --> 01:30:28,190
I love you, hold on to me, boy.

1597
01:30:29,792 --> 01:30:33,729
I'm sorry, Dad.
I'm gonna have to let you go.

1598
01:30:33,796 --> 01:30:36,732
Goddamn it,
you hold on to me, John.

1599
01:30:36,799 --> 01:30:38,501
You hold on to me.

1600
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:42,705
(SHOUTING) Johnny!

1601
01:30:43,539 --> 01:30:45,541
Johnny!

1602
01:30:48,243 --> 01:30:49,788
JOHNNY: They say to move
forward in life,

1603
01:30:49,812 --> 01:30:51,880
you gotta let go of the past.

1604
01:30:51,947 --> 01:30:54,750
Well, I did, literally.

1605
01:30:54,817 --> 01:30:56,819
And for me,
there ain't no going back.

1606
01:30:58,253 --> 01:31:01,389
So here I am,
paying my debt to society.

1607
01:31:01,456 --> 01:31:03,526
They found the cash,
traced the passports...

1608
01:31:03,592 --> 01:31:05,628
got me on
first-degree manslaughter.

1609
01:31:05,694 --> 01:31:08,363
But hey, I saved
that little girl's life

1610
01:31:08,430 --> 01:31:10,365
and I set my mother free...

1611
01:31:10,432 --> 01:31:13,502
so for once in my life,
I'm the good guy.

1612
01:31:13,569 --> 01:31:15,337
I guess no good deed
goes unpunished.

1613
01:31:16,805 --> 01:31:17,940
JANE: Hey, Johnny.

1614
01:31:18,006 --> 01:31:19,374
Hi, honey.

1615
01:31:19,441 --> 01:31:20,543
Hi, Johnny.

1616
01:31:20,609 --> 01:31:21,677
Hi, Oliv.

1617
01:31:24,513 --> 01:31:27,616
You look great.
You both look great.

1618
01:31:27,683 --> 01:31:29,585
Yeah, how are you?

1619
01:31:30,586 --> 01:31:32,621
Oh, great. Peachy.

1620
01:31:34,189 --> 01:31:35,591
You?

1621
01:31:35,658 --> 01:31:36,959
Good, good.

1622
01:31:37,025 --> 01:31:38,794
Yeah, yeah, we're doing okay.

1623
01:31:40,663 --> 01:31:42,130
How's Mom?

1624
01:31:42,197 --> 01:31:43,732
She's great.

1625
01:31:43,799 --> 01:31:45,167
Actually,
she's living with us now.

1626
01:31:47,603 --> 01:31:48,804
Us?

1627
01:31:48,871 --> 01:31:51,506
Yeah. Olivia moved in
to our house to...

1628
01:31:52,808 --> 01:31:55,210
You know,
to help with Mom and...

1629
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:59,715
Jane and I...

1630
01:31:59,782 --> 01:32:01,684
Well, we've decided...

1631
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:05,854
We've decided
to have the baby, Johnny.

1632
01:32:09,124 --> 01:32:10,458
Like a couple?

1633
01:32:11,226 --> 01:32:12,227
(BOTH LAUGHING)

1634
01:32:13,896 --> 01:32:15,698
We're not rushing into anything.

1635
01:32:15,764 --> 01:32:19,201
Yeah, no, we're just taking it
one day at a time.

1636
01:32:19,267 --> 01:32:20,368
Yeah.

1637
01:32:21,837 --> 01:32:23,338
What about me?

1638
01:32:24,673 --> 01:32:26,408
Johnny, you made it clear

1639
01:32:26,474 --> 01:32:28,052
that you didn't want to have
anything to do with children...

1640
01:32:28,076 --> 01:32:30,245
so I didn't think
it was going to be an issue.

1641
01:32:30,312 --> 01:32:32,447
Besides, we don't know
when you're gonna be

1642
01:32:32,514 --> 01:32:35,651
available to
participate with him.

1643
01:32:35,718 --> 01:32:38,821
Him? You mean it's a boy?

1644
01:32:38,887 --> 01:32:41,023
Oh, well...

1645
01:32:41,089 --> 01:32:42,891
it's too early
to know the sex yet.

1646
01:32:42,958 --> 01:32:47,663
But if it is a boy, we've
decided to name him Bill.

1647
01:32:51,734 --> 01:32:54,202
Yeah, I think that's fitting.

1648
01:32:54,269 --> 01:32:57,572
And if it's a girl,
so far we like Java.

1649
01:32:59,007 --> 01:33:00,242
Java?

1650
01:33:00,308 --> 01:33:02,410
Yeah, Jane and Olivia.

1651
01:33:02,477 --> 01:33:04,246
BOTH: Java.

1652
01:33:07,515 --> 01:33:10,218
You do know that's
a slang term for coffee?

1653
01:33:10,285 --> 01:33:15,223
Yes, but it's also
an exotic island in Asia.

1654
01:33:15,290 --> 01:33:17,826
Why don't you just call her Sex
on the Beach, for chrissakes?

1655
01:33:17,893 --> 01:33:20,796
God! Johnny, do you always have
to be so god damn sarcastic?

1656
01:33:20,863 --> 01:33:23,565
No, I just don't want my child
named after a beverage.

1657
01:33:23,632 --> 01:33:25,367
JANE: Oh,
so now it's your child?

1658
01:33:25,433 --> 01:33:28,070
Well, yeah, biologically.

1659
01:33:28,136 --> 01:33:29,404
And I have to say, you know,

1660
01:33:29,471 --> 01:33:33,075
I'm a little hurt here
and I feel a little left out.

1661
01:33:33,141 --> 01:33:34,819
Seems like there's been
a lot of decisions made...

1662
01:33:34,843 --> 01:33:37,846
without any thought
of how I might feel about it.

1663
01:33:37,913 --> 01:33:39,824
JANE: Well, you haven't
really been available, Johnny.

1664
01:33:39,848 --> 01:33:41,483
OLIVIA: Yeah.

1665
01:33:41,549 --> 01:33:42,727
JOHNNY: I don't know how much
more available I can be.

1666
01:33:42,751 --> 01:33:44,787
I'm pretty much here, you know.

1667
01:33:44,853 --> 01:33:46,765
JANE: There's not really any
answering machine to get messages.

1668
01:33:46,789 --> 01:33:50,025
JOHNNY: Every Wednesday
from 2:00 to 6:00.

1669
01:33:50,092 --> 01:33:52,127
JANE: You know what, Johnny?
This isn't about...
