1
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,714
# Bread of heaven,
bread of heaven... #

2
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,154
# In this barren wilderness...

3
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,233
# Song of praises, song of praises

4
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:55,111
# I will ever give to thee, I... #

5
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,274
# Be the Lord...

6
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:47,439
# Song of praises, song of praises

7
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,515
# I will ever give to thee... #

8
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,993
# Wake of death and... #

9
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,233
# Song of praises, song of praises

10
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,349
# I will ever give to thee

11
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:33,878
# I will ever give to thee

12
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,511
# When I pass
the verge of Jordan...#

13
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,709
# Song of praises, song of praises

14
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,395
# I will ever give to thee

15
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:58,955
# I will ever give to thee...#

16
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,394
Amen!

17
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,838
# Amen#

18
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,318
- Hello, Reverend.
- Mr. Allnut.

19
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,553
Here's your mail. Sorry I'm late,
but one thing and another kept me.

20
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,870
You know how it is.
Or maybe you don't.

21
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,996
- Good morning.
- Morning, miss.

22
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,469
- Ah, splendid. They've come at last.
- Huh?

23
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,029
- My rose trees.
- You'll stay for tea?

24
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,556
Don't mind if I do.
I need something in my condition.

25
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,793
I'll get a going over when I return.
Them Belgians'll call me names.

26
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,191
But I don't mind being cussed.
They won't fire me.

27
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,717
Nobody except yours truly can
get up steam on the African Queen.

28
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,637
You take sugar I seem to remember,
Mr. Allnut.

29
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,553
- That's right, couple of spoonfuls.
- And milk?

30
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,954
That's right, miss.

31
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,199
- Bread and butter?
- That's right, miss.

32
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,272
- Brother?
- Thank you.

33
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,510
Just listen to this stomach of mine.

34
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,911
The way it sounds, you'd think
I had a hyena inside me.

35
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,594
Do have more bread and butter,
Mr. Allnut.

36
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,109
Thanks, miss,
I... I don't mind if I do.

37
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,473
Excuse me.

38
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,233
Queer thing, ain't it?

39
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,951
I mean, what do you suppose makes
a man's stomach carry on like this?

40
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,951
Try a rock cake, Mr. Allnut.

41
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,388
No, thanks, miss.

42
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,279
- Herbie Morton's a bishop.
- Huh?

43
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,192
- Who's that, dear?
- Surely you remember Herbie.

44
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,229
Blond, younger than I am, ruddy.
He sang a solo at the commemoration.

45
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,799
"Holy, Holy", I think.

46
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,599
I think I remember.
It was so long ago.

47
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,830
- He's a bishop now.
- Splendid.

48
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,834
I'd say Herbie was a bit younger
than me, four or five years.

49
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,879
It's surprising, really.
He wasn't up to much as a student.

50
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,600
No more than his share
of social graces.

51
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,752
- Then, of course, he married well.
- Oh.

52
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,310
That manufacturer's widow.
What was his name?

53
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,152
Griggs? Briggs. That was it.

54
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,073
Alfred Briggs. Soap flakes, I think.

55
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,389
Mrs. Alfred Briggs.

56
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,994
Not to take anything
away from Herbie.

57
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,435
- I'm delighted for him.
- Of course.

58
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,591
Ain't a thing I can do about it.

59
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,435
- It was "Holy, Holy".
- More tea, Mr. Allnut?

60
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,828
Thank you, no, miss.

61
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,754
I'd better shove off if I'm to get
back to the mine by tomorrow.

62
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,912
- Don't hurry, Mr. Allnut.
- Do stay for dinner.

63
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,957
Thanks just the same.

64
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,872
Oh, uh...

65
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,079
I probably won't be coming around
this way for a couple of months.

66
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,037
Really? What about our mail?

67
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,430
There's not gonna be any for a while.

68
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,955
- Why not?
- The Germans will hold it up.

69
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,918
- Why, in Heaven's name?
- On account of the war.

70
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,674
- War? Where, Mr. Allnut?
- Europe.

71
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,319
Indeed? Between whom?

72
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,199
Oh, uh... Germany, England.

73
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,510
- England?
- That's right.

74
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,717
- You really mean war?
- That's what they tell me.

75
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,634
Germans claim the British started it.
British blame the Germans.

76
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,793
- What do you know? What's happened?
- That's all I can remember.

77
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:35,236
Oh, yes. The French are in it
and all them little countries,

78
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,518
Austria, Hungary, Belgium, Spain,
I forget who's with who.

79
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,513
- Is that all you can tell us?
- That's all I know.

80
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,591
I'll find out more in Lubumbashi.

81
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,716
I wonder what our position will be?

82
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,111
What harm could be done
in this godforsaken place?

83
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,157
God has not forsaken this place,

84
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,834
as my brother's presence
bears witness.

85
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,791
- Oh, no offence, miss.
- War.

86
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,520
Yeah. Yeah, looks like it.

87
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,672
Well, I'll be shoving off.
Thanks for the tea.

88
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,910
Take care of yourselves.

89
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,672
Goodbye. Thank you.

90
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,068
Goodbye, Mr. Allnut.

91
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:15,551
Wretched man. He's a Canadian.
Doesn't he realise he's in this, too?

92
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,234
Shouldn't we
try to get to Lubumbashi?

93
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,712
The good shepherd doesn't desert
his flock when wolves are prowling.

94
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,273
We must ask the Almighty
to bless England

95
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,113
and carry her
through her hour of trial.

96
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,195
Rose, go in the house and stay there.

97
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,874
What's the meaning of this?
How dare you?

98
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,434
Ooh!

99
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,956
Samuel? Samuel!

100
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,833
Dear, here you are,
and without your hat on.

101
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,718
Didn't you hear me calling?

102
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,589
Yes, but I must get the seeds in.
It's a bit late... August.

103
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,470
But, dear, you know it doesn't matter
when one plants in central Africa.

104
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,713
Africa?

105
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,954
Brother, dear,
you're not at all well.

106
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,439
A-Africa?

107
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,233
I'll help you off with your things.

108
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,436
Rose...

109
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,797
Brother! Brother! Dear!

110
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,313
Smite the Amalekites, oh, Lord.

111
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,675
Smite them. Hit them, die.

112
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,909
Amen.

113
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,393
Cold. Foggy.

114
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,551
Where's Rose?

115
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,996
- Rose, are you down in the shop?
- I'm here.

116
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,310
Bring me a nice, hot cup of tea.

117
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,994
I'm here, brother, beside you.

118
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,515
I try so hard, you know, to study...

119
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:34,309
Hebrew, Greek...
I've got no facility.

120
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,758
If I don't pass the examinations,
I shall volunteer as a missionary.

121
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,196
Rose, too.
Not comely among the maidens,

122
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,239
but she, too, can be a servant
in the house of the Lord.

123
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,029
Even for such as she,
God has a goodly purpose.

124
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,837
I'm putting my books away.
I'm not working any more.

125
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,152
If I don't pass, it'll just mean
that God has other work for me.

126
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,799
Thy will be done.

127
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:09,717
Oh, no, Lord, if it be thy will,
let me distinguish myself.

128
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,112
Give me a call...
here, in England, at home.

129
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,032
Mother would be so proud.

130
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,511
Oh, Lord. I have tried so hard.

131
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,594
So, they've been here, too, eh?

132
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,036
After I left the other day,
the drums started in the forest.

133
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,830
Pretty soon my boys was moaning.
I asked 'em what the trouble was.

134
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,278
They said the drums said the soldiers
was marching off their people

135
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,989
and burning their villages
so they couldn't come back.

136
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,232
When I got to the mine,
everything was a shambles.

137
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,473
My boys took one look
and bolted into the forest.

138
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,519
The way I look at it, they plan
to make soldiers of the natives

139
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,716
and take over all Africa.

140
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:08,396
- Where's the reverend?
- He's in there. He's dead.

141
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:13,031
Oh. Oh, well, now, ain't that awful?

142
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,476
If they'd shoot a reverend
couldn't do 'em a bit of harm,

143
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,073
there ain't nobody safe.

144
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,438
They didn't shoot him, Mr. Allnut,
but they may as well have done.

145
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,995
Oh, that's certainly too bad, miss.
That's all I can say.

146
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,151
When'd he die, miss?

147
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,754
He died early this morning.

148
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,559
Excuse me, miss.
What I mean to say is,

149
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,032
what with the climate, the quicker
we get him buried the better...

150
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,509
if you don't mind
my saying so.

151
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,831
- You got a spade?
- Behind the bungalow.

152
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,312
I expect he'd like to be buried
in the shade.

153
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,109
While I'm digging the grave,
you get your things together.

154
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:58,159
We can clear out in a hurry.
The Germans might come back anytime.

155
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,594
Why should they?

156
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,399
They'll be back,
looking for the African Queen.

157
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,757
They'd give a lot to get their hands
on her and what's in her

158
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,117
blasting gelatine,
cylinders of oxygen and hydrogen,

159
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,078
heaps of things
them Germans could use.

160
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,151
The Germans.

161
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,198
I figure we can go somewheres
behind an island

162
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,873
and talk about what to do.

163
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,510
- I'll get ready.
Fine. I'll be as quick as I can.

164
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,718
Let's go, miss.
Let's go while the going's good.

165
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,839
Pardon me.

166
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,797
Mind taking the tiller, miss?

167
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,598
- Huh?
- Come on.

168
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,876
- But I can't steer.
- Come on.

169
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,271
A little to starboard, miss.
No, no. The other way.

170
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,831
Ah. So far so good.

171
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,716
Here we are safe and sound.

172
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,314
- The question is, what next?
- Quite.

173
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,914
We got heaps of grub.
We're all right.

174
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,833
2000 cigarettes, two cases of gin.

175
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,195
We could stay here for months
if we wanted to.

176
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,510
Not a bad place to sit out a war.

177
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:36,070
All the comforts of home,
including running water.

178
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,313
We simply can't remain in this
backwater until the war is over.

179
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,792
Can't we, miss? You got the map.
Show me a way out, I'll take it.

180
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,270
The British will attack.
Which way will they come?

181
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,319
Maybe from the sea, but that would
put the Germans between us.

182
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,472
Mightn't our soldiers come in
from British East?

183
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:00,031
But the war would be over before they
hacked through that forest.

184
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,111
We're in a bit of a fix, miss.

185
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,397
One thing's sure,
they won't come up from the Congo.

186
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,836
They can't cross that lake
while the Luisa's there.

187
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,116
- The Luisa?
- A 100-ton steamer.

188
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,589
The Germans brought her in sections.

189
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,991
She's the boss of the lake
cos she's got a six-pounder.

190
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,675
- What's that?
- The biggest gun in central Africa.

191
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,752
- I see.
- Without the Luisa, it'd be easy.

192
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:28,232
The Germans wouldn't last a month
if our men could get across the lake.

193
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,960
All that don't get us
any closer to home.

194
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,914
This river, the Ulanga,
runs into the lake, doesn't it?

195
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,752
Well, yes, miss, it does.

196
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,515
But if you got ideas about going
in this launch, get rid of 'em.

197
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,671
Why?

198
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,876
Well, first off, there's Shona.

199
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,996
The Germans have a fort there.

200
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,833
If we tried to pass their guns,
they'd blow us up.

201
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,752
Then there's the rapids.

202
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,390
100 miles of water
like it was coming from a fire hose.

203
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,074
Then the river's called the Bora.

204
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,676
They didn't know it was the same
river until this Spengler...

205
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,116
- He got down it, I remember.
- Yes, in a dug-out canoe.

206
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:10,159
With six Swahili paddlers.
That was his map you was looking at.

207
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,440
Mr. Allnut, what's in these boxes
with the red lines on them?

208
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,637
Oh, them?
Well, that's blasting gelatine, miss.

209
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,917
- Is it dangerous?
- No, miss. That's safety stuff.

210
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,038
You can get it wet
and it don't do it any harm.

211
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,875
You can hit it with a hammer,
and it won't go off.

212
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,837
Takes a detonator to set it off.

213
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,549
- I'll put it over the side for you.
- No, we may want it.

214
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,111
What are these long, round,
torpedo-like things?

215
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,955
Oh, them? Them's oxygen
and hydrogen cylinders, miss.

216
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,509
- Mr. Allnut...
- I'm still right here.

217
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,831
There ain't any other place
I could be on a 30-foot boat.

218
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,913
You're a machinist, aren't you?
Wasn't that your job at the mine?

219
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,914
Yes, a kind of jack-of-all-trades,
master of none, like they say.

220
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,277
- Could you make a torpedo?
- How's that, miss?

221
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,829
Could you make a torpedo?

222
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,877
A torpedo?

223
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,157
Ask me to make a dreadnought
and do it up right.

224
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,232
A torpedo?
You don't know what you're asking.

225
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,154
There ain't nothing so complicated
as the insides of a torpedo.

226
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,312
It's got gyroscopes,
compressed air chambers...

227
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,155
But all those things,
they're only to make it go, right?

228
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,914
Yeah. Yeah, go
and hit what it's aimed at.

229
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,356
Well, we've got the African Queen.

230
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,033
Uh, how's that, miss?

231
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,909
If we were to fill those cylinders
with that blasting gelatine

232
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,200
and fix them out over the boat,
then run the boat against a ship,

233
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,432
they'd go off just like a torpedo,
wouldn't they?

234
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,989
Yeah, if they had detonators
in the end.

235
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,674
We could get a good head of steam up,

236
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,549
and just before she hits,
we could dive off, couldn't we?

237
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,029
Why, sure, miss. Sure. Absolutely.

238
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,475
There's one thing wrong
with your idea.

239
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,551
There ain't nothing to torpedo.

240
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,551
Oh, yes, there is.

241
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,075
- Is what?
- Something to torpedo.

242
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,071
- What's that?
- The Luisa.

243
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,673
The Luisa?!

244
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,512
Oh, now, don't talk silly.

245
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,990
You can't do that, honest!
We can't get down the Ulanga.

246
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,118
Spengler did.
If a German did it, we can, too.

247
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,679
You never tried it!

248
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,718
I never tried shooting myself
in the head neither!

249
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,838
Trouble is,
you don't know anything about boats.

250
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,318
In other words, you refuse
to help your country

251
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,438
- in her hour of need, Mr. Allnut?
- Huh?

252
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,670
Well, I wouldn't put it that way.

253
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,400
Just how would you put it, Mr. Allnut?

254
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:39,633
All right, have it your way,
but don't blame me for what happens.

255
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,597
Very well. Let's get started.

256
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,716
- What, now, miss?
- Yes, now.

257
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,791
There ain't two hours of daylight.

258
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,554
We can go a long way
in two hours.

259
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,030
Uh, I'll have to get the old kettle
to boiling and...

260
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,913
Well, do so, Mr. Allnut.

261
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,672
"Could you make a torpedo?"

262
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,832
"Well, do so, Mr. Allnut."

263
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,196
A little to starboard, miss.
That's right.

264
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,079
Hey, you're doing fine, miss.

265
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,596
It's really quite easy,
isn't it, Mr. Allnut?

266
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,830
Ah, you got to learn
to read the river.

267
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,399
Read the river?

268
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,279
Yeah. You see that long thing
over there,

269
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,192
looks kind of like a "v"?

270
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,429
That means a snag.

271
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,160
- Oh.
- This choppy water over here,

272
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,072
that means shallow.

273
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,915
The Queen don't draw much water,
so we can go right over 'em.

274
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,878
Most boats would get
their bottoms tore up.

275
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:55,272
And when it's smooth and flat
like that over there?

276
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,715
Does that mean a rock, Mr. Allnut?

277
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,438
Rocks or hippo, miss.

278
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,556
But don't go
bumping into no hippo.

279
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,716
Makes them awful mad.

280
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,917
This boat's only big enough
for the two of us.

281
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,556
What was the matter, Mr. Allnut?

282
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,951
Steam pump's full of scum and rust.
She gets clogged up.

283
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,317
Kicking her starts her
working again. I gotta act fast.

284
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:41,234
One of my boys dropped a screwdriver
down the safety valve.

285
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,278
What would happen
if you didn't kick her?

286
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,953
Whole boiler'd blow up.

287
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,989
But if we're going downstream,
why do we need the engine at all?

288
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,958
Boat's gotta go fast
or you can't steer.

289
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,510
If I let the engine die going
down the rapids, we'd be goners.

290
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,114
- Mr. Allnut?
- Yes, miss?

291
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:07,159
Why not dismantle the safety valve
and remove the screwdriver?

292
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,231
I'm gonna do that one of these days.

293
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:14,633
I ain't done it cos I kind of like
kicking it. She's all I've got.

294
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,232
Ahh... it's kind of hot work,
ain't it, miss?

295
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,869
I could do with a drink. Excuse me.

296
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,268
Oh.

297
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,672
You gonna have one, miss?

298
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,318
No.

299
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,636
- What is it?
- Gin, miss.

300
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,513
- Something the matter, miss?
- No.

301
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,716
How'd you like a nice cup of tea?

302
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,468
I'd like a cup of tea.

303
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:03,913
It'll taste a little rusty,
but we can't have everything, can we?

304
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,474
There you are.
Get this out of the way.

305
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,792
- Sugar, miss?
- Thank you.

306
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,712
Don't mention it.

307
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,758
- A bit of supper, miss?
- It's too hot to eat.

308
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,879
- How long you been out here, miss?
- About 10 years.

309
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,396
- What part of England are you from?
- The Midlands.

310
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,916
- Sounds pretty, anyway.
- Yes, it is. It's very pretty.

311
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,638
Ever get homesick?

312
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:55,952
It's Sunday afternoons I think of
most, the peace and the quiet.

313
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:00,830
Yeah, on Sunday afternoons,
I was always sleepin' one off.

314
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,836
- This is very, very good.
- Yes, it isn't half bad, is it?

315
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,230
What brought you to Africa,
Mr. Allnut?

316
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:13,359
The Zambezi bridge. A whole boatload
of us Canucks came to work on it.

317
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,433
Don't know why they wanted it,
both sides of the river the same,

318
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,239
but why does a chicken
cross the road?

319
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,312
- I beg your pardon?
- Nothing, miss.

320
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,275
Ah, sometimes I wish I was back
rubbing elbows, as they say.

321
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:33,514
There's nothing like the noise of a
Saturday night to cheer a fellow up.

322
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,757
The rest of the week,
I'd be taking orders from somebody.

323
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,992
Out here I'm my own boss.
Anyway, I was until...

324
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,116
Hey, you didn't see any crocodiles,
did you, miss?

325
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,429
Crocodiles? No.

326
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,798
There's no shallows for 'em.
The current's too swift.

327
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,394
I could do with a bath
before I turn in.

328
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,959
I'd like a bath myself.

329
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,157
Well, I'll go in the bow and
hang off the anchor chain,

330
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,029
you stay back in the stern
and do whatever you have to.

331
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,634
As long as we don't look,
it won't matter.

332
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,158
Well, how about it, miss?

333
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,477
Very well, Mr. Allnut.

334
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,471
That's the ticket.

335
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,635
- Mr. Allnut!
- Right here.

336
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,155
I can't get back into the boat.

337
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,833
I'll give you a hand.

338
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,911
Close your eyes, Mr. Allnut.

339
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,793
All right.
I'm all right, thank you.

340
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,959
Mr. Allnut!

341
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,634
I'm sorry I woke you, miss.

342
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,034
What are you doing?

343
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,714
I... I ain't doing nothing, miss.

344
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:14,714
Well, get out. This instant!

345
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,479
Mr. Allnut!

346
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,511
Mr. Allnut!

347
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,831
You may come in out of the rain!

348
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,872
Thank you, miss.

349
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:08,388
- Oh, miss?
- Yes, Mr. Allnut?

350
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,755
I'm sorry I gave you such a turn.

351
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,310
That's quite all right, Mr. Allnut.

352
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,519
- Good night, miss.
- Good night, Mr. Allnut.

353
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:54,639
- What a frightfully strong smell!
- What smell?

354
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,074
The river.

355
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,357
Smells like marigolds, stale ones.

356
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,714
Does, huh?

357
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,952
Not a very good smell for a flower.

358
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,554
They're very pretty,
though, marigolds.

359
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,039
They are, huh?

360
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,189
- Mr. Allnut?
- Yes, miss?

361
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,272
The current's quite strong
here, isn't it?

362
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,192
Yes. We're getting near the rapids.

363
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,759
Really? So soon?

364
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,558
Just around that bend.

365
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,910
Kind of dangerous.
Better let me take over.

366
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,319
Here you are, miss.

367
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,996
- Well, miss?
- Yes, Mr. Allnut?

368
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,037
- How'd you like it?
- Like it?

369
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,760
- White water rapids.
- I never dreamed.

370
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,798
I don't blame you for being scared,
not one bit.

371
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,520
Ain't nobody
ain't scared of white water.

372
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,639
I never dreamed a mere physical
experience could be so stimulating!

373
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,756
How's that?

374
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,032
I've only known such excitement
a few times before,

375
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:20,273
in my brother's sermons
when the spirit was really upon him.

376
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,431
- You want to go on?
- Naturally.

377
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,670
- Miss, you're crazy!
- Pardon?

378
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,070
What if we'd come against them rocks?

379
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,468
But we didn't.

380
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,428
I must say I'm filled with admiration
for your skill, Mr. Allnut.

381
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:36,957
Do you suppose, after I've practised,
that someday I might try?

382
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,635
Miss, them rapids ain't nothing
to what's in front of us!

383
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,791
I wouldn't call them rapids at all.

384
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,520
- I can hardly wait.
- But, miss!

385
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,750
Now that I've had a taste of it,

386
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,798
I don't wonder you love boating,
Mr. Allnut.

387
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:13,110
Is something the matter,
Mr. Allnut? Tell me.

388
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,717
Nothing you'd understand.

389
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,757
I simply can't imagine.

390
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,037
It's been such a pleasant day.
What is it?

391
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,633
Yes, Mr. Allnut?

392
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,952
All this foolish talk about
the Luisa, going down the river.

393
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,590
- What do you mean?
- We ain't doing nothing of the sort.

394
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,671
Sure we are.
What an absurd idea.

395
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:39,150
"What an absurd idea. What an absurd idea."

396
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:43,677
Lady, you've got 10
absurd ideas for my one. Ha.

397
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:48,116
Just why don't you want to go on,
Mr. Allnut?

398
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,840
- The river at Shona.
- Shona?

399
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,672
You're darn right, Shona.

400
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,798
All it takes is one bullet
in the blasting gelatine

401
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,757
and we're in bits and pieces.

402
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,071
- Then we'll go by night.
- Oh, no, we won't.

403
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,468
Then it's the rapids.

404
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,235
Nobody in their might rind
would tackle the rapids at night.

405
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,949
Then we'll go in daylight
on the far side from Shona

406
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,553
as fast as ever we can.

407
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:15,269
- Oh, no, we won't.
- You agreed to go.

408
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,955
I never did.
I never agreed to nothing.

409
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:23,875
You are a liar, Mr. Allnut,
and what is worse, you are a coward.

410
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,918
Woo! Coward yourself.

411
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,196
You ain't no lady. No, miss.

412
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,557
That's what my poor old mother
would say to you,

413
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,154
if my poor old mother
were to hear you.

414
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,038
Whose boat is this, anyway?

415
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,078
I asked you onboard
cos I was sorry for you

416
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,959
on account of you
losing your brother.

417
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:46,430
That's what you get
for feeling sorry for people.

418
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:51,071
I ain't sorry no more, you crazy,
psalm-singing, skinny old maid!

419
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:04,436
# There was a bold fisherman

420
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,876
# Set sail from off Pimlico

421
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,554
# And when he got off Pimlico

422
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,109
# The winds did begin to blow

423
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,795
# And the little boat
wibble-wobbled so

424
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,748
# Then overboard went he

425
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,469
# Singing twinky deedle dum

426
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,517
# Twinky deedle dee

427
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:32,355
# Was the highly interesting song
that he sung

428
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,029
# Twinky deedle dum

429
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,714
# Twinky deedle dee... #

430
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,669
Oh.

431
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:09,113
Oh, miss. Oh, have pity, miss.

432
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,114
Oh, you don't know
what you're doing, miss.

433
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,754
I'll perish without
a hair of the dog.

434
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,478
Oh, miss.

435
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,273
It ain't your property!

436
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,510
Ooh. Oh...

437
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,830
Oh, what a head.

438
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,877
# There was a bold fisherman

439
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,554
# Set sail from off Pimlico

440
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,917
# To catch the bold piggy

441
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,469
# And the gay macaroo

442
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:04,679
# But when he left Pimlico,
the winds... #

443
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,475
Ah, it's great to have a
lady aboard with clean habits.

444
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,392
Sets the man a good example.

445
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:16,678
A man alone,
he gets to living like a hog.

446
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,877
Then, too, with me,
it's always put things off.

447
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:23,271
Never do today
what you can put off till tomorrow.

448
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,956
But with you,
business before pleasure every time.

449
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:31,430
Do all your laundry,
make yourself spick-and-span,

450
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,795
get all the mending out of the way,

451
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,313
and then, and only then,

452
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:39,712
sit down for a nice quiet hour
with the good book.

453
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:42,917
I tell you, it's a model,
like an inspiration.

454
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:46,629
I ain't had this engine
so clean in years, inside and out.

455
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,553
Just look at her, miss.
See how she sparkles.

456
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,711
Myself, too.

457
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:55,589
Guess you never saw me
without whiskers and cleaned up.

458
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,230
I'll bet you wouldn't recognise me,
that much of a change.

459
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,675
Dressed up, too.

460
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,877
If I only had some
clean clothes like you.

461
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:09,397
Now, you...
Why, you could be at high tea.

462
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:13,599
Say, that's an idea, miss.
How's about a nice little cup of tea?

463
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,752
Don't you stir.
I'll be glad to make it for you.

464
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,756
Uh... how's the book, miss?

465
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,399
Not that I ain't read it.

466
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:42,074
My mum used to
read me stories out of it.

467
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,194
How's about reading it out loud?

468
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:50,108
I could sure do with
a little spiritual comfort myself.

469
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,920
And you call yourself a Christian.

470
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:02,636
Do you hear me? Don't you? Don't you?

471
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,157
Huh? Huh?

472
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,073
What you being so mean for, miss?

473
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:29,392
Man takes a drop too much once in a
while, it's... only human nature.

474
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,118
Nature, Mr. Allnut,

475
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,158
is what we are put in this world
to rise above.

476
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,636
Miss...

477
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:41,349
I'm sorry. I apologise.

478
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,910
What more can a man do
than say he's sorry, huh?

479
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:50,353
You done paid me back, miss.
You didn't even leave me a drop.

480
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,716
Miss, have a heart. Fair's fair.

481
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:57,156
You've got to say something.
I don't care what it is.

482
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:59,595
I'll be honest with you, miss, I...

483
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,910
I just can't stand no more of this.

484
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,877
I just ain't used to it.

485
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:07,589
So, you think it was your
nasty drunkenness I minded.

486
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,875
Well, what else?

487
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,315
You promised you'd go down the river.

488
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:16,759
Miss, listen to me...
and try to understand.

489
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:19,957
There's death a dozen times over
down the river.

490
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,759
I'm sorry, but blame the Ulanga.

491
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,035
You promised.

492
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,395
Well, I'm taking my promise back!

493
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,431
All right, miss, you win,

494
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,353
as the crocodiles
will be glad to hear.

495
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,794
Down the river we go.

496
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,911
Have some breakfast, Mr. Allnut.

497
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:56,038
Thanks. Don't mind if I do,
cos it'll be my last.

498
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:00,273
Oh, no. Get up steam.
Breakfast can wait.

499
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,916
Waiting for their supper, miss.

500
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,755
Which side of the river
is Shona on?

501
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,035
How's that, miss?

502
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:27,637
- Which bank is Shona on?
- Over to starboard, miss.

503
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,917
Good. Then the sun
will be in their eyes.

504
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,071
Huh?

505
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,913
I say the sun will be in their eyes!

506
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,671
Don't be worried, Mr. Allnut.

507
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:56,513
Oh, I ain't worried, miss.

508
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,717
Gave myself up for dead
back where we started.

509
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,078
Mr. Allnut.

510
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,272
Better get down, miss!

511
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,038
- What?
- Fire.

512
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,873
Come here. Fire on the ship.

513
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:03,711
Get down lower, miss!

514
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,155
Nothing to do
but let her drift, miss.

515
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,635
Are we going to be all right,
Mr. Allnut?

516
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,916
Oh, yes. Everything's all right,

517
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:05,959
if we can keep up steam and the
boiler don't bust and that mend holds

518
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:09,430
and we don't pile up on them rocks.

519
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:05,794
Oh!

520
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,509
We made it! We made it!

521
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:46,874
Hip, hip, hooray!

522
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,759
We sure put one over on them!

523
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,672
How curious to be shot at.

524
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:55,753
- They didn't shoot till we passed!
- One isn't afraid at all.

525
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,559
They didn't believe we'd
go down the gorge!

526
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:02,235
- The bullets sound like mosquitoes.
- Cos who could?

527
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,197
I felt like clapping at them!

528
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:07,113
Well, we showed 'em!
Hip, hip, hooray!

529
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:20,429
Was my handling
of the boat all right?

530
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,238
Well, yes, miss.

531
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,356
It was better than all right,
miss.

532
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:27,956
Well, we're...
we're running short of fuel.

533
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,951
We'd better put in someplace.

534
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:57,112
Well, I... better do some pumping,
we'll be swimming pretty soon.

535
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,475
- Oh, let me do that.
- Oh, no, miss.

536
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:02,074
No, please let me,
while you get fuel.

537
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:06,870
Easy does it, miss.
Don't wear yourself out.

538
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,271
Picked up a thorn in my foot.

539
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,072
- It's gone right through the sole.
- Let me.

540
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,268
Oh, thank you, miss.

541
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:22,992
Do you... recognise these flowers,
Mr. Allnut?

542
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,878
Huh?

543
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,997
I've never seen them before.

544
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:32,474
Well, I can't say as I have, either.

545
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,596
Perhaps no one has.

546
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:37,194
I don't suppose
they even have a name.

547
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:42,550
Whether they have
or not, they... sure are pretty.

548
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:57,359
Mr. Allnut.

549
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,674
Dear.

550
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:10,354
Well... well, now.

551
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:14,758
This is more like it...
breakfast in bed.

552
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,839
Two spoonfuls of sugar is right,
isn't it?

553
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,037
Fancy you building a fire and all
while I slept.

554
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,750
Dear, what is your first name?

555
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:35,353
- Charlie.
- Charlie.

556
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,595
That's a nice name.
Charlie, Charlie.

557
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:41,875
Give us a kiss.

558
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,589
Charlie. Charlie.

559
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:54,150
The more I look at this place,
the prettier it gets.

560
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:58,598
I expect it's just about
the prettiest place I've ever been to.

561
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:01,957
Not that I ain't all for
going on down the river.

562
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:04,953
The sooner we blow up the Luisa,
the better.

563
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,350
What I meant was...

564
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:10,557
I'd like to come back here someday.

565
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:13,757
- Then you think we can do it.
- Of course we can.

566
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,912
Nothing a man can't do
if he believes in himself.

567
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:19,594
Never say die, that's my motto.

568
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:20,994
I've had misgivings.

569
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:24,311
I was beginning to think the
whole thing was a mistake.

570
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,630
How's that, miss, I mean, Rosie?

571
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,950
I had a moment of weakness.

572
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:32,430
If you're weak, a day or two here
won't make any difference.

573
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:35,910
Oh, no. We'll go on.

574
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:39,789
Thank heaven for your strength,
Charlie.

575
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:05,635
Oh! No!

576
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:48,679
Hey, Rosie. Listen.

577
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,997
We nearly done it that time.

578
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:39,278
- How much damage have we done?
- Let's get the water out and see.

579
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,836
Yeah. Better than
we could have hoped for.

580
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,116
Skin's tight, no water coming in.

581
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:59,192
What was that clattering
before we stopped?

582
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:01,351
That's what we gotta find out.

583
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,590
How are you going to do that, dear?

584
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,513
I gotta go down underneath
and take a look.

585
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:09,672
I hope there's no fancy currents
down there.

586
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:13,837
Well, here goes.

587
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,437
- Could you see anything, dear?
- Yeah.

588
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:44,310
Shaft's twisted like a corkscrew,
and there's a blade off the prop.

589
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,232
We'll have to mend it, then.

590
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:50,551
Mend it? Ha. Fat chance.

591
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:56,158
Oh, why is that, dear? What should
we have to do before we can go on?

592
01:01:56,320 --> 01:02:00,711
I'll tell you what we could do
if we was back in Lubumbashi.

593
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:03,955
We could pull this old tub out,

594
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:08,193
haul the shaft to the workshop
and forge it straight again.

595
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:11,033
We could write the makers
for a new prop.

596
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:15,193
They might even have one,
as this boat's only 30 years old.

597
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:19,638
While we wait, we could
clean 'er bottom, paint 'er up.

598
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:24,555
Then we put the new shaft in
and the new prop and go on our way.

599
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,070
But this ain't Lubumbashi.

600
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:32,030
Couldn't you straighten the shaft
without taking the boat up on shore?

601
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:34,509
Uh... I don't know. I might.

602
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:37,911
Means working under water.
Could be done, maybe.

603
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:42,596
If you could get the shaft
up on shore, could you straighten it?

604
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:46,719
I ain't got no anvil,
hearth, coal, I ain't got nothin'!

605
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:51,795
I saw a Masai native working once
using charcoal on a big hollow stone.

606
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:54,474
He had a boy to fan the charcoal.

607
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,238
Yeah, I've seen that.

608
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,392
I'd use a bellows myself...
make one easy enough.

609
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:02,836
Well, if you think that
would be better.

610
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:06,670
There's lots and lots of firewood
on the bank.

611
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:08,558
Why don't you try it?

612
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:12,234
No. No, no.

613
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:13,958
It ain't no use, Rosie.

614
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:16,839
I was forgetting the prop...
blade's gone.

615
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,434
Can't we use the blades
that are left?

616
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:24,435
The prop would be off balance.
The shaft would be twisted up again.

617
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,477
We'll have to make a new blade.

618
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:29,871
There's lots of iron
and stuff that you could use.

619
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:31,871
Yeah. Tie it on!

620
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:34,759
Well, if you think
that would do, but...

621
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:37,753
wouldn't it be better to weld it on?

622
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:41,230
Isn't that the right word, dear?
Weld it on?

623
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,629
You're a one, Rosie. Really, you are.

624
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,756
But isn't "weld" the right word?

625
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:51,150
You know what I mean
even if it isn't.

626
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:05,153
I swallowed half the river that time.

627
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:07,834
You were down there
an awfully long time.

628
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,309
The shaft don't want to come,
it's stuck!

629
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:11,799
- Charlie.
- Huh?

630
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:14,599
- Let me help you.
- What are you going to do?

631
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:18,435
- I'm going down there.
- Rosie, the currents are fierce!

632
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:21,034
I don't want a drowneded woman
on my hands.

633
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:24,272
What will you be thinking of next?

634
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:27,159
Well... here goes.

635
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:50,432
If my dad had put me to blacksmithing
when I was a kid,

636
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:53,592
I don't think I should have ever
come to Africa.

637
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:55,879
I might have...

638
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:59,271
but then I wouldn't have met you,
Rosie, old girl.

639
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,158
Charlie.

640
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:03,834
Well. There.

641
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:06,394
That's about as good
as I could get it.

642
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:08,437
Didn't take so long, neither.

643
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:11,353
Blade'll be different.
I gotta make that.

644
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:39,430
It turns right enough,
but that don't mean nothing.

645
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:43,195
Question is, will she stand up
under a full head of steam?

646
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:46,238
Well, we'll get the answer
out there.

647
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:49,198
The Lord help us
if it ain't the right one.

648
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:33,955
Looks like this old river got tired
of all the running and jumping

649
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:37,669
and decided to rest for a while.

650
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:42,118
This must be where the river changes
her name from Ulanga to Bora.

651
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,678
Ah, pinch me, Rosie.

652
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:50,400
Here we are, going down the river

653
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:53,597
like Antony and Cleopatra
on their barge.

654
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:04,313
If it hadn't been for you,
this couldn't be.

655
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:07,711
- Aren't you proud of yourself?
- Certainly not.

656
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:11,077
You kept the engine going.
You mended the propeller.

657
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:12,468
It wasn't me at all.

658
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:16,030
There's not another man alive
who could've done it.

659
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:19,351
Right you are,
cos no other man alive's got you.

660
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:22,796
I'll never forget
how you looked going over the falls.

661
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:26,077
Head up, chin out,
hair blowing in the wind.

662
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:28,549
The living picture of a heroine.

663
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:30,915
Fancy me a heroine.

664
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:33,719
Oh, Charlie.
You've lost your mind.

665
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:36,593
Lost my heart, too.

666
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:40,399
Should we drop the anchor,
sweetheart?

667
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:44,917
The river needs to rest for a while.
I suppose we do, too.

668
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:03,832
Rosie, soon we're gonna wish
we was back shooting the rapids.

669
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,513
- Ooh!
- Oh!

670
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:07,033
Ooh, this is awful.

671
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:09,350
We gotta get out of here.

672
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:10,635
We got no steam.

673
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:13,394
- I'm going under the water.
- That's it.

674
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:16,799
- No!
- But I'm being eaten alive!

675
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:19,599
About what you said, look at that.

676
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:24,390
Oh! Get me out of here.
I can't stand it! Oh! Ahh!

677
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:28,792
Ahh! Charlie! Charlie! Charlie!

678
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:32,752
Charlie! Charlie!

679
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:36,913
Ohh, Charlie!

680
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:46,271
Oh. Oh...

681
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:48,555
Charlie!

682
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:53,551
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

683
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:23,233
We got away from them.
You can come out now.

684
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:29,909
I'm ashamed of myself, Charlie,
acting this way,

685
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:33,595
but I... I couldn't help it,
I was going mad.

686
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:35,955
Oh, you are so bitten.

687
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:39,635
The bites themselves ain't so bad,
it's having 'em around you.

688
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:43,236
I've heard of them
driving buffalo stark, staring mad

689
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:47,393
so they just run and run
until they fall down dead.

690
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:49,994
Will it be that way
wherever we tie up?

691
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:53,914
- Probably.
- What are we going to do, Charlie?

692
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:58,870
Well, if the river keeps straight,
deep and slow, not much can hurt us.

693
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:02,589
I'll let the anchor out.
That'll keep us out of trouble.

694
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,788
How much further do you suppose it is
to the lake, Charlie?

695
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:18,589
Not so many miles as the crow flies.
No telling how many days.

696
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:22,833
All depends on how much
winding around this old river does.

697
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:28,115
Ah... what a time we've had, Rosie.

698
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,670
What a time.

699
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:36,038
We'll never lack for stories
to tell our grandchildren, will we?

700
01:10:57,040 --> 01:11:00,191
Nothing but grass and papyrus
as far as you can see.

701
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:04,239
- Which is the main channel?
- Don't look like there is one.

702
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:09,354
- What are we going to do, Charlie?
- I don't know.

703
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:15,317
We can't just go round and round
here forever.

704
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,516
Can't just go round and round.

705
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:22,872
We get in and the grass
closes in back of the stern,

706
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:24,758
there's no going back, Rosie.

707
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:29,994
Anything happens, we just sit there
till we go off our heads with fever.

708
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:34,315
- I know it.
- All right.

709
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:37,870
You pays your money
and you takes your choice.

710
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:39,712
That way.

711
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:41,233
Pull her over.

712
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:42,758
We've come along by steam,
we've paddled and pushed

713
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:46,196
and pulled this old boat
along with a hook.

714
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:50,717
What we ain't done up to now
is get out and carry her.

715
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,916
Looks like that'll come next.

716
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:56,231
It's hard to breathe,
the air is so heavy.

717
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:58,914
Can't tell it from the water.

718
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:01,878
Or the water from the land,
for that matter.

719
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,795
All the channels we've lost,

720
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:09,157
all the twisting and turning
we've done.

721
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:12,437
We may come out where we started,
if we come out at all.

722
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:15,034
We've always followed the current.

723
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:17,760
That don't mean
nothing to this river!

724
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:19,638
This river's crazy...

725
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:21,233
crazy as I am!

726
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:22,628
Charlie. Charlie.

727
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:26,596
Sorry, old girl.

728
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:28,876
Well...

729
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:32,669
Only thing to put the roses
back in our cheeks

730
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:35,115
is to get out of these reeds.

731
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:46,752
What I said about having to get out
and carry this old boat

732
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:49,070
was meant to be a joke.

733
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:52,073
Don't look like a joke now. Well...

734
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:36,793
Ahh!

735
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:39,590
Ooh!

736
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:41,591
Ooh!
Ooh, the little beggars!

737
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:49,515
Ooh, ooh. Pull them off me.

738
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:53,116
No! If the heads stay in,
they'll poison your blood.

739
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:54,679
Salt. Salt, salt.

740
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:08,676
Ewww. The legs.

741
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:22,474
Eww.

742
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:26,758
Oh, if there's anything in the world
I hate, it's leeches!

743
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:29,229
The filthy little devils.

744
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:03,437
There. There, dear. There.

745
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:06,717
Fine specimen of a man
I am, ain't I?

746
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:09,599
You're the bravest man
that ever lived.

747
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:11,637
You just overdo, that's all.

748
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:14,917
What you need is a few hours sleep.

749
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:20,078
There.
Now, are you all comfortable?

750
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:21,593
Go to sleep, dear.

751
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:25,548
And when you wake up,
we'll be on our way again.

752
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:28,359
- Rosie...
- Yes, Charlie?

753
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:30,670
You want the truth, don't you?

754
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:36,312
Even if we had all our strength,
we'll never get her off this mud.

755
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:39,995
- We're finished.
- I know it.

756
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:41,479
But, Rosie...

757
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:44,791
I'm not one bit sorry I came.

758
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:47,520
What I mean is...

759
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:49,079
it was worth it.

760
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:04,512
Dear Lord...

761
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:09,351
we've come to the end of our journey.

762
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:13,593
In a little while,
we will stand before you.

763
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:16,877
I pray for you to be merciful.

764
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:22,478
Judge us not
for our weakness but for our love,

765
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:27,031
and open the doors of heaven
for Charlie and me.

766
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:35,599
Rosie.

767
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,119
Rosie.

768
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:45,797
Rosie. Rosie, dear.

769
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:48,474
Look. We're on the lake.

770
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:51,273
The rain did it...

771
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:55,798
just lifted the old Queen up
and carried her over the mud.

772
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:58,997
We couldn't have been a 100 yards
from it last night.

773
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:00,509
Look, Rosie.

774
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:10,076
Let's build a fire
and get the engine started

775
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:13,038
and get into the middle
where we can breathe.

776
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:16,033
Sure, sure.
We'll be out of here in a jiffy.

777
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:27,716
This air...

778
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:30,110
- isn't it wonderful?
- Yeah.

779
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:33,875
It's like... You don't approve,
but it's like a shot of gin.

780
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:37,555
Makes your blood race,
your face numb and your spirits soar.

781
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:40,359
I'm sorry I poured that gin out,
Charlie.

782
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:41,953
Aw, forget it, Rosie.

783
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:46,352
To show there's no hard feelings,
I'll make you another cup of tea.

784
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:54,392
You carry on more over a cup of tea
than I do over a glass of gin.

785
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:59,915
Is it?

786
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:02,594
It's the Luisa
and she's coming right at us.

787
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:04,119
She must be doing 12 knots.

788
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:07,238
We've gotta make a run for it
back to the reeds.

789
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:07,998
She's coming right toward us.

790
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:22,675
I thought for a minute
they'd seen us.

791
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:24,831
They're going toward that island.

792
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,709
Probably anchor there tonight
and leave in the morning.

793
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:34,798
Don't worry. They'll be back again.
You know how the Germans are.

794
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:37,520
They lays down systems
and sticks to them.

795
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:41,639
Mondays they're one place,
Tuesday someplace else

796
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:43,916
and Wednesday they'll be back here.

797
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:47,789
How long will it take
to get the torpedoes ready?

798
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:49,279
I don't know.

799
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:53,149
It depends on the detonators.
Gotta devise something.

800
01:24:56,440 --> 01:24:58,954
I know what you're thinking, Rosie.

801
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:01,799
You're thinking of
taking the Queen out at night

802
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:04,633
when the Luisa comes back, ain't you?

803
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:07,519
Well, we ought to manage it.

804
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:12,909
There. That ought to work.

805
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:17,790
When we ram her, these nails will
shoot the bullets into the gelatine.

806
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:19,632
Charlie, you're wonderful.

807
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:22,553
Can't put them in the cylinders yet.

808
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:25,234
We'll do that when
we're ready to start.

809
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:27,914
It'll be dark by then.
Can you do it in the dark?

810
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:30,031
It's a case of have to.

811
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:33,192
You're sure they'll come back
with the Luisa?

812
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:34,952
Mm-hmm. Dead sure.

813
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:38,317
The lake's 100 miles long,

814
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:41,552
Luisa does about...
uh, about 12 knots.

815
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:44,871
That's 120 miles a day. Yup.

816
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:46,917
She'll be back here tomorrow.

817
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:51,713
When she comes,
we'll be ready for her.

818
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:02,553
Charlie, let's make the Queen
as clean as we can.

819
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:05,075
Scrub her decks and polish her brass.

820
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:09,711
Sure. She ought to look her best
representing the Royal Navy.

821
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:19,437
- You know, Rosie, I been thinking.
- Yes, Charlie?

822
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:25,198
There ain't no use in
us both going to do it.

823
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:29,990
- Now I see it's a one-man job.
- You couldn't be more right, dear.

824
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:32,634
So when the time comes, I'll put you
off on the east shore.

825
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:35,957
You'll wait while I attend
to the Luisa.

826
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:38,833
- You're the one to be put ashore.
- Me?

827
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,719
This was my idea.
I'm the one to carry it out.

828
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:45,031
Why, Rosie, I'm surprised!
You're a sensible woman.

829
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,156
We won't have any more talk
like that.

830
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:50,431
I can manage this boat
as well as you, and you know it.

831
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:52,630
Rosie, you're cracked!

832
01:26:52,720 --> 01:26:54,836
Didn't I steer going down the rapids?

833
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:59,238
But you don't know about the engine.
Suppose she broke down on you.

834
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:01,556
Me, I'd walk back and do
a thing or two to that engine...

835
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:04,592
spit on her, kick her,
and she'd go right to work.

836
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:11,109
- Oh, she knows who's boss.
- I suppose you're right.

837
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:13,960
Well, now, that's all settled.

838
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:17,237
I'll dive off just before the crash,
swim to shore,

839
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:18,913
and we'll be off to Kenya.

840
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:22,356
I meant it may be necessary
for you to come along.

841
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:25,671
Didn't we just agree
this was a one-man job?

842
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:29,196
But you convinced me
that it isn't, so it's settled.

843
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:31,476
- We'll go together.
- Oh, no we won't.

844
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:33,631
You'll wait for me
on the east shore.

845
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:36,314
Who do you think you are,
ordering me about?

846
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:40,393
I'm the captain, and you ain't going.
You'd only be in my way.

847
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:43,791
I suppose I was in your way
going down the rapids.

848
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:46,474
Then what you said
back there was a lie,

849
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:49,234
about how you couldn't
have done it alone

850
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:53,029
and how you'd
lost your heart and... everything.

851
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:54,553
You liar!

852
01:27:57,080 --> 01:28:01,870
Oh, Charlie,
we're having our first quarrel.

853
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:06,670
Oh, Rosie, it's only that
I just can't bear the thought of...

854
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:09,877
What I mean is,
suppose something should happen...

855
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:14,158
- not that anything will, but...
- Don't you understand, Charlie?

856
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:17,756
I wouldn't want to go on to Kenya
without you.

857
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:23,312
Oh, Rosie. All right.

858
01:28:23,480 --> 01:28:26,472
It'll be you at the tiller
and me at the engine,

859
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:28,995
just like it was from the start.

860
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:34,558
And there's the Luisa, right on time.

861
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:08,198
Blowing up a bit.

862
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:10,316
Better get started. All right?

863
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:14,632
Charlie! Charlie, I can't steer!
It's hard to steer.

864
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:16,233
Too much water in the bow.

865
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:18,595
Moves out of the water
half the time.

866
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:24,196
Gotta get her nose up
or it's trouble!

867
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:54,478
Rosie, we're sinking.

868
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:38,117
Rosie! Rosie!

869
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:41,430
Rosie! Rosie!

870
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:44,279
Rosie!

871
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:49,876
What is your nationality?

872
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:55,717
- French? Belgian? British?
- Yeah.

873
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:58,997
- Yes, what? - British.

874
01:31:59,160 --> 01:32:01,071
What were you doing on the island?

875
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:03,310
Uh, oh, uh, fishing.

876
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:07,473
You are aware the punishment
for giving false testimony

877
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:09,835
is death by hanging?

878
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:12,439
Who cares?

879
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:14,591
What were you doing on the island?

880
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:16,749
I was fishing.

881
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:20,515
- How did you get there?
- I swam.

882
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:23,069
You're in an area prohibited to all

883
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:27,677
but members of the forces of His
Imperial Majesty Kaiser Wilhelm II.

884
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:29,159
Who cares?

885
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:33,791
You are accused of being a spy
for the British armed forces.

886
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:38,511
Have you anything to say that might
lead this court to believe otherwise?

887
01:32:38,680 --> 01:32:40,636
I told you I was fishing.

888
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:01,509
The court rules death by hanging.

889
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:04,319
Sentence to be
carried out immediately.

890
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,638
Was there a woman with you?

891
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:31,278
Rosie! Rosie! Rosie! Rosie!

892
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:32,634
Charlie!

893
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:33,789
Rosie!

894
01:33:35,640 --> 01:33:36,709
Charlie!

895
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:41,954
Who's that woman?

896
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:43,274
I... I don't know.

897
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:47,069
- You called out her name.
- I thought she was somebody else.

898
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:49,037
I shall hang you twice, I think.

899
01:33:55,160 --> 01:33:57,355
- Charlie.
- Rosie.

900
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:02,312
Who are you?

901
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:06,358
Miss Rose Sayer.

902
01:34:07,640 --> 01:34:10,074
- English?
- Of course.

903
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:16,471
- Why were you on the lake?
- I ain't told 'em nothing.

904
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:17,914
Silence!

905
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:25,550
- What were you doing on the lake?
- We were boating.

906
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:27,790
Last night in such weather?

907
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:30,474
We were not responsible
for the weather.

908
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:32,989
As your fellow prisoner has learned,

909
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:35,754
the penalty for not answering
is death.

910
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:39,950
You mean he... Charlie...

911
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:41,633
- Stop that.
- Order.

912
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:43,995
Are they going
to hang you, Charlie?

913
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:47,470
Fräulein Sayer,
you will answer the question.

914
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:49,710
Very well. Ask your questions.

915
01:34:49,880 --> 01:34:51,359
Why were you on the lake?

916
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:54,637
We came to sink this ship,
and we would have except...

917
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:57,758
Let's at least have the pleasure
of telling them.

918
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:00,150
Don't believe her. She's touched.

919
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:01,639
Stop that, Charlie.

920
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:04,473
I'm certainly not
going to outlive you.

921
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:08,838
And just how, Fräulein,
did you propose to sink the Luisa?

922
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:11,476
With torpedoes.

923
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:14,234
- Torpedoes?
- Nein.

924
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:17,193
Will you be so good as to tell us

925
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:21,035
exactly where and how
you acquired torpedoes?

926
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:25,193
- Mr. Allnut made them.
- How very interesting.

927
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:27,032
You don't believe me, do you?

928
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:30,237
Charlie, tell them how
you made the torpedoes.

929
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:32,516
Well, well, I...

930
01:35:32,680 --> 01:35:35,911
See, I took the heads off
two cylinders of oxygen,

931
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:38,435
and filled them with live explosive.

932
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:41,876
That was easy enough.
The detonators took some doing.

933
01:35:42,040 --> 01:35:46,318
You know what I used? Cartridges
and nails and blocks of soft wood.

934
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:50,075
Then I put the two cylinders
in the bows of the African Queen,

935
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:51,468
near the water line.

936
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:52,993
When we rammed you, poof!

937
01:35:53,320 --> 01:35:55,231
Where is the African Queen?

938
01:35:55,400 --> 01:35:57,231
She sank in the storm.

939
01:35:57,400 --> 01:35:58,958
How did you get onto the lake?

940
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:02,271
We came down the Ulanga.
The Bora, you call it here.

941
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:06,035
- That's impossible.
- Nevertheless.

942
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:08,111
But the river's unnavigable.

943
01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:09,872
That may be.

944
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:13,919
We came down it, though,
didn't we? And in the African Queen.

945
01:36:52,120 --> 01:36:54,759
Would you hang us together, please?

946
01:36:54,920 --> 01:36:57,559
- Noose.
- Wait a minute.

947
01:36:57,720 --> 01:36:59,119
- Hey, Captain...
- Yes?

948
01:37:00,760 --> 01:37:04,673
- Will you grant us a last request?
- What is it?

949
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:06,717
- Marry us.
- Was?

950
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:12,955
We want to get married.
Ship captains can do that, right?

951
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:14,189
- Ja!

952
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:17,636
Why, Charlie, what a lovely idea.

953
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:19,870
What kind of craziness is this?

954
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:22,873
Come on, Captain.
It'll only take a minute.

955
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:25,395
It'll mean such a lot to the lady.

956
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:28,233
Very well,
if you wish it absolutely.

957
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:35,676
What are the names again?

958
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:40,753
- Charles.
- Rosie. Rose.

959
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:45,550
Do you, Charles, take this woman
to be your lawful wedded wife?

960
01:37:45,720 --> 01:37:47,358
Yes, sir.

961
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:51,399
Do you, Rose, take this man
to be your lawful wedded husband?

962
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:52,913
I do.

963
01:37:57,520 --> 01:38:00,478
By the authority vested in me
by Kaiser Wilhelm II,

964
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:02,358
I pronounce you man and wife.

965
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:04,431
Proceed with the execution.

966
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:23,829
- Hey, what happened?
- We did it, Charlie! We did it!

967
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,638
But how?

968
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,752
Well, what do you think?

969
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:34,352
You all right, Mrs. Allnut?

970
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:36,556
Wonderful.
Simply wonderful.

971
01:39:36,720 --> 01:39:38,199
And you, Mr. Allnut?

972
01:39:38,360 --> 01:39:39,475
Pretty good...

973
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:42,154
for an old married man.

974
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:44,475
I'm all twisted around, Charlie.

975
01:39:44,640 --> 01:39:46,517
Which way is the east shore?

976
01:39:46,680 --> 01:39:48,716
The way we're swimming, old girl!

977
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:51,235
# There was bold fisherman

978
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:53,436
# Set sail from off Pimlico

979
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:58,435
# To catch the bold piggy
and the gay macaroo

980
01:39:58,600 --> 01:40:01,398
# But when he got off Pimlico

981
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:03,596
# The wind, it began to blow... #
