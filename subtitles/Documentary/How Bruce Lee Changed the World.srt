1
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:38,332
When Bruce Lee died, he was only 32.

2
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:41,290
His sudden death shocked the world.

3
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:43,499
To his fans,

4
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,874
he was a unique superstar.

5
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,707
But to our family,

6
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:49,415
he was our brother.

7
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:54,457
We grew up and spent our childhood together.

8
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:58,207
Looking at this house reminds me of

9
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:01,332
my brother Phoenix, my family

10
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,790
and how we grew up together.

11
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:07,124
I'm overwhelmed with emotions.

12
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:10,749
This movie is about Bruce Lee's untold story,

13
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:13,707
which is also our family story.

14
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:51,790
Why did you set me up?

15
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,749
I'm just a poor farmer,

16
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:59,915
I can't read poetry.

17
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,082
Chuen, I just got a call.

18
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,874
Your wife is going into labor.

19
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,332
Quick.

20
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:23,915
Get the car.

21
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:34,790
My Father Lee Hoi-chuen was

22
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:37,124
a leading comic in Cantonese Opera.

23
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:40,874
That year, he took Mother with him
on a tour in San Francisco.

24
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:43,582
They were greeted with a surprise.

25
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:47,874
It actually snowed in San Francisco.

26
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:52,040
Push. . .

27
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,124
You can do it, push. . .

28
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:57,415
I can see your son.

29
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,415
Chuen, here they come.

30
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,749
Grace,

31
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:14,582
are you tired?

32
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:15,957
I'm fine.

33
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,165
Boy or girl?

34
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,290
Boy. . .

35
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,249
A son.

36
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,124
Thank Heavens.

37
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,957
Excuse me.

38
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,290
- Are you alright?
- Chuen...

39
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,124
- Excuse me, sir.
- She's talking to you.

40
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,624
We need the boy's name for registration.

41
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,915
Name?

42
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:40,332
Push... Push...

43
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,332
Push. . .

44
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,874
P. . . Push. . . Push. . .

45
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:45,957
Bruce?

46
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,415
Push... Lee. . .

47
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:51,957
- Bruce Lee?
- Yes. . .

48
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:53,457
Is that it?

49
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,582
Push. . .

50
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,290
Push Lee.

51
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:22,707
Camera. . . action.

52
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:27,332
I'm sure the three of us

53
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,874
will be happy here.

54
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:34,915
Cut.

55
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:36,165
Is that OK?

56
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:37,499
Good take.

57
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,332
Is he done?

58
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,290
Yes.

59
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,165
Thanks for letting us use him.

60
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,665
This is for him.

61
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,040
You shouldn't have.

62
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,290
Chinese on the road

63
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:50,332
should help each other out.

64
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,832
You're going back to Hong Kong?

65
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,874
Yes, I'm trying to get tickets.

66
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:56,582
It's not safe back home. You should stay.

67
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,499
I can't. I have a big family to support.

68
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,165
I have to go back.

69
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:04,124
Mother sent a telegram yesterday.

70
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,540
She wanted us to stay for now.

71
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,957
She doesn't mean it.

72
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:11,124
She couldn't wait to meet her grandson.
We must go.

73
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,624
Welcome home, Master Chuen.

74
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:34,207
Lee Jun-fan, you're home.

75
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,374
You're home.

76
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:43,749
- Where's Mother?
- Upstairs...

77
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,749
- Watch out.
- Let me see him.

78
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:49,249
- Mother...
- Mother is upstairs.

79
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,582
Mother.

80
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,082
Master Chuen is back.

81
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,624
Mother.

82
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:00,790
Chuen?

83
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:02,874
Mother.

84
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,582
Father.

85
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:10,957
Phoebe, Agnes, Peter.

86
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:12,374
- Mother.
- Mother.

87
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:13,290
You're home.

88
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:14,915
Yes.

89
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:18,124
Kowtow to your ancestors, not to me.

90
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,124
Mother.

91
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,082
My grandson.

92
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,415
So cute.

93
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,124
Look at Him.

94
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,040
Have you named him yet?

95
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:31,624
I want to call him...

96
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,707
Phoenix... give him a girl's name,

97
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:37,332
to fool the demons so he'll grow up well.

98
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,624
Phoenix. . .

99
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,124
Get me two eggs.

100
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:55,832
Pass me the ginger.

101
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,624
The soup is ready, turn down the stove.

102
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,582
The fish looks very delicious.

103
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,457
Hurry.

104
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,457
Clean up the kitchen.

105
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:12,290
Let's eat.

106
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,207
Stop playing, Skinny.

107
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,332
Come here and eat.

108
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:20,874
Dinner is ready.

109
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,624
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

110
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:28,332
Let's eat. . . Phoenix. Let's eat.

111
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,332
Good boy.

112
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,415
Let's eat.

113
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:41,290
Sorry.

114
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:49,165
Let's eat.

115
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:50,915
Let's eat, Mother.

116
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:54,124
Let's eat.

117
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:59,749
The food in San Francisco is not for man.

118
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,749
It's for those devils.

119
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:03,915
It's for those foreign devils.

120
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,374
Those steaks and potatoes...

121
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:06,749
There's no place like home, I like rice...

122
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:10,374
Chuen, don't talk with your mouth full.

123
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,165
- Right, Mother.
- Good boy. . .

124
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,290
You know why I

125
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,415
named him Phoenix?

126
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:17,582
Why?

127
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,082
He's born in wartime.

128
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:23,957
I want him to rise like a phoenix in a fire.

129
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,749
Back in San Francisco, I already. . .

130
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:31,957
I told you not to talk with your mouth full.

131
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,249
Right, Mother.

132
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,915
Kiddo, this house is full of women,

133
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:56,999
and with a girl's name like Phoenix,

134
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:59,540
you might grow up to be a sissy.

135
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:03,707
Let me help you be a man.

136
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:09,790
Does he look like me?

137
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:14,540
Oh my goodness. Leave him alone.

138
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:18,540
Ngan, please take Phoenix.

139
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:20,457
- Phoenix.
- Look at you.

140
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,749
What has he done to you?

141
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,165
I'll put you to bed, all right?

142
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,790
Clean him up.

143
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,540
Don't worry.

144
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:31,124
Go. Phoenix has gone to bed.

145
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,624
When I met you,

146
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,374
your hands were soft

147
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:54,790
and smooth.

148
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:58,665
Now they're coarse and yellow. . .

149
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,874
Thanks to your pipe.

150
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,207
Who knows

151
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:09,832
when the Japs will be here?

152
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:14,249
Let's hope the Brits can hold them off.

153
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:24,790
Actually, what's important is

154
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:28,249
for our family to be in a piece

155
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,415
and to be together.

156
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,540
Go to sleep, Phoenix.

157
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:22,832
Our house was always bustling.

158
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,249
Father worked hard to support us

159
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,707
while Mother looked after everyone.

160
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:31,540
The days went by quickly.

161
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,582
Don't bother with make-up,

162
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,707
the show will probably be cancelled.

163
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:53,915
Why?

164
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,832
The Japs dropped a bomb in Shatin.

165
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,249
They'll be crossing the Lo Wu Bridge soon.

166
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:01,957
Forget the show.

167
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,165
Let's go home.

168
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,624
You're so lucky, Mother.

169
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,707
The Japs are at our front door

170
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:44,832
but you don't have to worry anymore.

171
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:55,290
The family is still together.

172
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,999
Phoenix is coming to his senses.

173
00:14:58,208 --> 00:14:59,999
Don't worry.

174
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:05,874
Open up.

175
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,415
Brother Chuen?

176
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,999
Open the door.

177
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:10,582
Open up.

178
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,832
So this is the Lee residence.

179
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,499
Go inside. . . hurry.

180
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,832
Go with Auntie Ngan.

181
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,582
Go inside. . . hurry.

182
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:35,249
General Wakuda wants to
meet the famous actor Lee Hoi-chuen.

183
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,540
I want your whole family to come out.

184
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:56,707
Yes.

185
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:05,207
Wakuda-san wants to

186
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:09,332
use Mr Lee's popularity

187
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:14,540
to incite your fellow actors to
serve the Japanese Imperial Army.

188
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,415
I'm flattered

189
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:21,290
but I'm only an actor trying to support a family.

190
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:25,540
I'm afraid I can't manage.

191
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:32,832
Don't be stupid, Mr Lee.

192
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:36,749
Actors like me can only entertain the people.

193
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:41,624
I can't help you

194
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:45,374
keep a facade of peace and stability.

195
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:49,249
That's what the Greater East Asia
Co-Prosperity Sphere is about.

196
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:55,082
Me and the Imperial Army are serving the people.

197
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,832
My brother said no. Get lost.

198
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,540
Go away.

199
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:06,665
If he won't,

200
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,457
perhaps you can dance for the troops.

201
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,624
Let go of me, asshole.

202
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,457
Bitch.

203
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:16,249
- Traitor.
- Idiot.

204
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:18,749
I'm sorry, Mr Wakuda.

205
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:20,790
I'm so sorry, Mr Wakuda.

206
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:23,207
Please forgive her naivete.

207
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,499
Please forgive her... I'm so sorry.

208
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,582
Say sorry to Mr Wakuda.

209
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:32,915
Apologize if you don't want to die. Say it.

210
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,290
I'm sorry. . .

211
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:36,207
Sorry.

212
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,249
Louder.

213
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,165
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm so sorry.

214
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:46,499
I'm sorry.

215
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:53,040
I'm sorry. . .

216
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,832
I'll handle this.

217
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:06,290
I'm sorry.

218
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:13,249
About the show... wise up

219
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,415
and do the right thing.

220
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,415
My name is Ngai.

221
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,165
Goodbye.

222
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,874
Sorry...

223
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,915
After the endless 3 years and 8 months,

224
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:28,082
Japan was defeated and Hong Kong was liberated.

225
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:33,874
Prosperity was restored and
life went back to normal.

226
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:41,124
Father continued to act while the kids grew up.

227
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,624
Everything was fine again in the Lee Family.

228
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:58,082
The baby kicked me again.

229
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,249
I won.

230
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:03,290
You're so lucky. I'm sure you'll win today.

231
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,165
It's Margaret's turn. She's our guest.

232
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,999
Thanks, Phoebe.

233
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,749
- Is the bean ready yet?
- Get me two eggs.

234
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,249
OK. OK.

235
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,999
Where's the sausage?

236
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,749
I'll kill you Japs.

237
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,207
Here comes the anti-Japanese fighter.

238
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:32,332
Stop it, Phoenix. Stop it.

239
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,040
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine.

240
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:40,665
I'll kill you Jap for bullying Margaret.

241
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:57,040
Father was enjoying a rare day off
when a guest dropped by.

242
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:58,707
His name was Leung Sing-po.

243
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,040
Don't be mad, I'll buy you dinner.

244
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,915
- What a crowd.
- I'm lucky today.

245
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,124
I'll get out of your way.

246
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,540
- Honey.
- Daddy.

247
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,957
Be a good girl, Honey.

248
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,874
Sir.

249
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:20,915
Po.

250
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,665
I came to pick up my brat.

251
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:25,457
What's your hurry? Sit down

252
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,665
and have a smoke.

253
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:30,040
No thanks, I smoke cigars in Singapore.

254
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:32,082
Help yourself.

255
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,332
What have you been up to lately?

256
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,999
I just finished a run

257
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:38,957
with "Fa Kam Sau" in Guangzhou.

258
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:42,749
I'll stay in Hong Kong after the New Year.

259
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:43,915
Good. You should come back.

260
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:47,249
When would you get me into films?

261
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:48,707
That will be swell.

262
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,249
I'll speak to the directors.

263
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:52,624
- I'm counting on you.
- You're welcome.

264
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:55,499
What?

265
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:56,749
I won.

266
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:59,082
- Pay up.
- Look.

267
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,665
You're a tile short. This one doesn't count.

268
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:04,415
What's the racket? Did someone win?

269
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:07,624
Get off it.

270
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,749
I think my baby is coming out.

271
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:09,957
You can't be...

272
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:11,749
Chuen. Your wife is having the baby.

273
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,040
Help her to her room.

274
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:21,374
Over here.

275
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:27,249
Ready. 1 , 2, 3, smile.

276
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:42,790
Aim carefully.

277
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:44,290
How could I miss?

278
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:46,790
Gosh, way too bad.

279
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:51,457
You lost again.

280
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:57,665
- Damn.
- It's a piece of cake.

281
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:01,707
- Great. We won.
- Brilliant.

282
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:07,290
Run.

283
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:08,499
He stole our marbles.

284
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:11,832
Stop there, you son of a bitch. Go after him.

285
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:15,082
Run faster.

286
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:16,499
How dare you took from me.

287
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:19,332
- Come back.
- Over there.

288
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,540
Kiddo, what's wrong with you?

289
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,707
- You bastard.
- Bastard.

290
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:32,499
Serve you right for taking my marbles.

291
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:36,040
How dare you try to rip me off.

292
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:37,207
Stop it.

293
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:39,290
I will return them to you.

294
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:42,457
You'll be my Chief, alright?

295
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:43,540
What's your name?

296
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,999
Unicorn.

297
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:46,999
- Do you know who I am?
- Yes

298
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:50,874
You're Lee Hoi-chuen's son, Phoenix.

299
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:52,290
You know me?

300
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:55,874
My father Choi Fei-lam is a stuntman.

301
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:57,499
I've seen you before.

302
00:23:57,666 --> 00:23:59,124
Then I'll let you go.

303
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:01,374
- He's the Chief now.
- Yes.

304
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:02,832
Chief.

305
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,207
Thanks. Chief.

306
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:05,832
Why did you kick me?

307
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,124
Your old man is a stuntman.
You should fight better.

308
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:09,207
Come fight with me.

309
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:12,374
Give him a hand, Skinny.

310
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:14,665
Tell your friends to jump in.

311
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:16,249
You're such a sloppy cat.

312
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:41,707
- Great.
- Brilliant.

313
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:43,832
You know what's in the box?

314
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:46,290
Mail?

315
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:51,415
Wrong. They hang rat bins on lamp posts.

316
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:54,082
Hanging rat bins on lamp posts.

317
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:55,749
Here's another one.

318
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:02,832
A rat. Grab it, don't let it get away.

319
00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:12,332
You go first.

320
00:25:22,208 --> 00:25:23,915
Damn you, Skinny.

321
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:25,374
You stink.

322
00:25:58,625 --> 00:26:00,207
OK.

323
00:26:03,916 --> 00:26:05,249
Don't get smug.

324
00:26:05,416 --> 00:26:07,207
I can smell you from a mile away.

325
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:08,665
This is so unfair.

326
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:10,457
Get down on your knees.

327
00:26:12,875 --> 00:26:15,040
Tell me what you have done.

328
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:17,582
I picked a fight, played hooky
and climbed up the pipes.

329
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,249
What else?

330
00:26:19,416 --> 00:26:21,207
- What have you done?
- Ouch.

331
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:23,457
How many times did I tell you?

332
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:26,707
How can I face Master Chuen? Why won't you listen?

333
00:26:26,875 --> 00:26:29,999
- Skinny's Mom.
- When will you ever learn?

334
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:33,457
Don't hit him.

335
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:37,207
It's my fault. I failed to discipline him.

336
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:42,124
Go inside.

337
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:45,874
You should look after Master Phoenix,

338
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:49,040
What are you doing? Give me that.

339
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:51,790
She's telling me I can't discipline my son.

340
00:26:51,958 --> 00:26:53,207
He's too little to get a beating.

341
00:26:53,375 --> 00:26:56,082
I must discipline him while he's little. Go away.

342
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,040
Sit down.

343
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:04,749
What have you done? The cops were here.

344
00:27:04,916 --> 00:27:06,124
I did nothing illegal.

345
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,540
No? You broke every rat bin

346
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:11,624
on the street.

347
00:27:11,791 --> 00:27:13,624
You're getting out of hand.

348
00:27:16,083 --> 00:27:18,582
Why are you crying? I haven't even started.

349
00:27:18,875 --> 00:27:20,624
Peter.

350
00:27:20,958 --> 00:27:24,249
You should watch your little brother.

351
00:27:27,416 --> 00:27:29,415
Stop crying. Phoebe.

352
00:27:29,583 --> 00:27:32,374
I know you tipped him off.

353
00:27:32,541 --> 00:27:35,499
And you, Agnes, you knew but didn't tell me.

354
00:27:35,666 --> 00:27:38,207
You all covered up for him.

355
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:42,874
Kowtow to your ancestors. 200 times each.

356
00:27:58,416 --> 00:27:59,749
Welcome, Mr Fung.

357
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,832
What's going on?

358
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,999
What brings you here?

359
00:28:10,166 --> 00:28:13,165
I want to talk to you about Phoenix.

360
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:14,999
Phoenix?

361
00:28:15,208 --> 00:28:18,749
Yuen Po-wan wrote an excellent script.
I'm directing it.

362
00:28:18,916 --> 00:28:22,290
I want Phoenix for the lead.

363
00:28:24,416 --> 00:28:27,374
Him? In a film? No.

364
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:30,915
He has the talent. He takes after you.

365
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:33,999
The role is tailor-made for him.

366
00:28:34,125 --> 00:28:37,290
It's a good opportunity. Think about it.

367
00:28:37,666 --> 00:28:41,040
Have some tea.

368
00:28:45,041 --> 00:28:46,499
Chuen.

369
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:49,957
Mr Fung has a good point.

370
00:28:50,125 --> 00:28:53,665
He even gave him a name:

371
00:28:54,708 --> 00:28:57,249
Lee Siu-lung, the Little Dragon.

372
00:28:58,083 --> 00:29:00,165
Little Dragon?

373
00:29:00,791 --> 00:29:05,124
It suits him.

374
00:29:05,916 --> 00:29:07,832
He's born in the year of the Dragon.

375
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:20,165
I'll think about it.

376
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:25,832
Little Dragon.

377
00:29:27,291 --> 00:29:33,290
Cool. I can skip school and act.

378
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:36,749
Cool.

379
00:29:36,916 --> 00:29:40,540
Follow him from the door.

380
00:29:40,708 --> 00:29:42,415
Bruce Lee, stand by.

381
00:29:42,708 --> 00:29:44,290
Right here.

382
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:47,124
Yes, stop right here.

383
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:48,874
Phoenix,

384
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:50,874
I mean Dragon.

385
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:53,290
This is what I want you to do...

386
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,915
I'll hide in here

387
00:29:55,083 --> 00:29:56,999
and you'll let me out.

388
00:29:57,166 --> 00:29:58,707
Still remember my name in the film?

389
00:29:58,916 --> 00:30:01,749
You're Flying Dagger Lee.

390
00:30:01,916 --> 00:30:03,582
Brilliant.

391
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:05,749
Action.

392
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,332
Where are the cops?

393
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,915
They're gone, you better split.

394
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:23,540
Want some money, kid?

395
00:30:23,708 --> 00:30:26,749
No. Let me double check.

396
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:35,457
They're gone?

397
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:36,540
Gone.

398
00:30:36,708 --> 00:30:37,915
Listen up, kid.

399
00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:40,499
If someone bullies you from now on,

400
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:43,332
look for me at No. 4, Tai Yuan Lane.

401
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,624
Just ask for Flying Dagger Lee.

402
00:30:45,791 --> 00:30:48,040
Flying Dagger Lee, right?

403
00:30:48,208 --> 00:30:49,249
You better go.

404
00:30:49,416 --> 00:30:50,915
Right.

405
00:30:53,541 --> 00:30:54,790
Close the door.

406
00:30:57,833 --> 00:30:59,999
Cut. How was it?

407
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:01,165
No problem.

408
00:31:01,291 --> 00:31:02,749
You did good.

409
00:31:02,916 --> 00:31:03,957
You bet.

410
00:31:04,125 --> 00:31:04,874
Next.

411
00:31:05,041 --> 00:31:07,249
Since then, not only Phoebe,

412
00:31:07,416 --> 00:31:10,624
but our whole family became Bruce's fans.

413
00:31:10,791 --> 00:31:12,957
He made a dozen more films

414
00:31:13,125 --> 00:31:16,165
and became a big star.

415
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,082
Peter, you'll represent

416
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:52,540
La Salle at the Inter-school Fencing Tournament.

417
00:31:52,708 --> 00:31:55,790
I'll do my best, Father Andrew.

418
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:59,249
How's your brother

419
00:31:59,416 --> 00:32:02,332
at St. Francis Xavier?

420
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,499
He came in No. 41

421
00:32:04,666 --> 00:32:06,499
in a class of 42.

422
00:32:06,666 --> 00:32:09,540
That's not bad, considering
he's always playing hooky.

423
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:42,040
Where do you live?

424
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,874
She lives next door to us.

425
00:32:44,041 --> 00:32:45,415
What's your name?

426
00:33:05,958 --> 00:33:08,582
Did you notice how pretty my partner is?

427
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,707
Yours is so-so.

428
00:33:10,916 --> 00:33:12,415
I'm not as fussy as you.

429
00:33:12,583 --> 00:33:13,915
Good for you.

430
00:33:14,083 --> 00:33:15,999
Cut the crap, Sloppy Cat.

431
00:33:16,375 --> 00:33:17,082
This is my cousin's friend,

432
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:18,749
Lau Lin-kong. He's from the U.K.

433
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:19,874
Call me Kong.

434
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:20,874
Hi, Kong.

435
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:22,582
You danced very well.

436
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,499
Thanks.

437
00:33:23,666 --> 00:33:26,665
From hanging out with the Brits?
No one dance like that in Hong Kong.

438
00:33:28,666 --> 00:33:30,332
Are you jealous?

439
00:33:31,708 --> 00:33:34,957
She likes a good looking guy, not you.

440
00:33:37,791 --> 00:33:40,790
Me? Jealous of him?
Girls fall for me right and left.

441
00:33:46,083 --> 00:33:50,332
I dare you to go over there
and see who she'll choose.

442
00:33:50,583 --> 00:33:52,999
Don't embarrass yourself, Sloppy Cat.

443
00:34:07,125 --> 00:34:09,707
You? She'll dance with you.

444
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,582
Elvis Piggy comes.

445
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:17,082
May I?

446
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:18,957
You're both so cute.

447
00:34:19,125 --> 00:34:21,874
I can't decide.

448
00:34:52,541 --> 00:34:54,457
What? The power is out?

449
00:34:58,416 --> 00:34:59,665
May.

450
00:34:59,833 --> 00:35:01,207
Maybe next time.

451
00:35:01,416 --> 00:35:02,957
You think you're Elvis?

452
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:05,415
I know Elvis of the Orient,

453
00:35:05,583 --> 00:35:07,790
but who are you?

454
00:35:12,791 --> 00:35:14,332
Move over.

455
00:35:17,666 --> 00:35:19,665
Margaret, you better come with me.

456
00:35:20,375 --> 00:35:21,874
You know this place?

457
00:35:22,041 --> 00:35:24,082
We all paid 50 cents to get in.

458
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:26,790
My old man owns this joint.

459
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,665
You're on my turf.

460
00:35:28,833 --> 00:35:31,624
I can't help it
if the girls prefer to dance with me.

461
00:35:31,791 --> 00:35:37,249
Get lost.

462
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:39,415
You want to pick a fight?

463
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:41,582
Get lost if you know what's good for you

464
00:35:47,166 --> 00:35:48,499
Run.

465
00:35:49,583 --> 00:35:51,499
Don't let them get away.

466
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:55,249
Get them.

467
00:35:58,458 --> 00:35:59,790
- Stop.
- Move away.

468
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:03,082
Move or I'll run over you. . .

469
00:36:03,375 --> 00:36:05,582
- Hurry, Bruce.
- Move.

470
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:08,165
This is for pedestrians.

471
00:36:11,416 --> 00:36:13,999
- Stop them.
- Don't move.

472
00:36:15,625 --> 00:36:17,290
Stop. Don't move.

473
00:36:18,291 --> 00:36:19,540
Run.

474
00:36:19,708 --> 00:36:21,499
Why did you ditch the bike?

475
00:36:21,666 --> 00:36:23,499
I can't ride a bike.

476
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:25,415
They're coming.

477
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:26,957
Meet up at the old joint.

478
00:36:29,208 --> 00:36:30,082
Stop.

479
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:33,332
Hop on, Bruce. Hurry.

480
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,624
Hurry. Don't let them get away.

481
00:36:45,958 --> 00:36:49,790
I came back for you, Phoenix.

482
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:58,540
Bruce Lee can't ride a bike.

483
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,207
Bastard.

484
00:37:34,041 --> 00:37:37,124
Skinny, you really crushed them.

485
00:37:37,291 --> 00:37:40,124
Your cat claws weren't so bad either.

486
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:42,249
You bet. I can claw 1 0 at a time.

487
00:37:42,416 --> 00:37:44,207
But nothing like Phoenix.

488
00:37:44,375 --> 00:37:46,374
He took on 20.

489
00:37:46,541 --> 00:37:48,749
You're flattering me.

490
00:37:49,875 --> 00:37:52,415
At least, nobody lost a tooth.

491
00:37:52,583 --> 00:37:53,665
It was my fault.

492
00:37:53,833 --> 00:37:55,707
If you hadn't come back for me,
we wouldn't be in such a mess.

493
00:37:55,875 --> 00:37:57,374
I'm sorry to have dragged you into this.

494
00:37:57,583 --> 00:38:00,582
We're buddies through thick and thin.

495
00:38:00,708 --> 00:38:04,957
We'll chase girls and spend some money.

496
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:05,707
In your dreams.

497
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:06,832
Hey, that hurts.

498
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,790
Really?

499
00:38:07,958 --> 00:38:09,540
Yes.

500
00:38:09,708 --> 00:38:11,582
Does it hurt here?

501
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:16,665
Come here...

502
00:38:16,833 --> 00:38:18,957
Get him.

503
00:38:21,708 --> 00:38:23,207
Stop.

504
00:38:35,708 --> 00:38:37,124
Go first.

505
00:38:51,625 --> 00:38:53,582
You stink.

506
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:36,957
You went on a date?

507
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:38,790
What about you? Another fight?

508
00:39:38,958 --> 00:39:40,790
You should talk.

509
00:39:40,958 --> 00:39:44,332
Father is performing in Cheung Chau tonight.

510
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,832
No need to worry.

511
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:06,749
Girls, why were you out so late?

512
00:40:07,583 --> 00:40:09,624
We went to the 7:30 show.

513
00:40:09,791 --> 00:40:11,457
We saw "Waterloo Bridge."

514
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:14,790
It's after 11 .

515
00:40:14,958 --> 00:40:17,999
Why didn't you come straight home?

516
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,624
I'm sorry.

517
00:40:25,375 --> 00:40:29,832
Look at you. You're in black and blue again.

518
00:40:30,583 --> 00:40:31,665
It's not his fault.

519
00:40:31,833 --> 00:40:35,582
I picked the fight. He was bailing me out.

520
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,624
Skinny.

521
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:39,874
I'm not asking you.

522
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,040
I'm responsible for my own mistakes.

523
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:46,707
I'll kowtow to the ancestors.

524
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:48,874
No, it was my fault.

525
00:40:49,041 --> 00:40:50,832
No, it was mine.

526
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,457
It was my fault.

527
00:40:52,625 --> 00:40:56,874
- I'm sorry, Mom.
- I'm sorry.

528
00:40:57,041 --> 00:41:00,540
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

529
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:03,749
- It was my fault.
- I'm sorry.

530
00:41:03,875 --> 00:41:06,915
Get down, Robert.

531
00:41:07,541 --> 00:41:09,415
- I'm sorry.
- Kowtow to the ancestors.

532
00:41:09,583 --> 00:41:13,249
- I'm sorry.
- It was my fault.

533
00:41:24,875 --> 00:41:27,082
I want you to learn,

534
00:41:27,791 --> 00:41:30,040
not just to kowtow.

535
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:35,332
Your Father works hard for this family.

536
00:41:35,916 --> 00:41:42,999
You get out of hand when he's away.

537
00:41:44,291 --> 00:41:47,499
You're all being insensible.

538
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:55,957
How can you face your Father?

539
00:41:58,083 --> 00:42:00,749
Sorry, Mom. We'll be good.

540
00:42:02,041 --> 00:42:03,749
Sorry, Mom.

541
00:42:03,916 --> 00:42:05,957
We won't go out at night anymore.

542
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:08,040
We won't go out at night.

543
00:42:15,291 --> 00:42:17,124
There's more, Miss Phoebe.

544
00:42:17,291 --> 00:42:18,540
Thanks.

545
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:20,624
This is for you, Phoenix.

546
00:42:20,791 --> 00:42:21,624
No thanks.

547
00:42:21,791 --> 00:42:23,874
It's for your eye. Not for you to eat.

548
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,415
Your eye is swollen.

549
00:42:25,583 --> 00:42:26,915
Save it for your ass.

550
00:42:27,166 --> 00:42:28,124
Let me do it.

551
00:42:28,291 --> 00:42:31,249
Stop it. Hurry up, we'll be late for school.

552
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:33,374
Hurry, Robert. Finish that egg.

553
00:42:34,083 --> 00:42:38,124
Open the door.

554
00:42:41,291 --> 00:42:43,165
This is a warrant

555
00:42:43,333 --> 00:42:46,374
to search your house.

556
00:42:46,958 --> 00:42:48,457
Get in.

557
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:49,790
I've been here before.

558
00:42:49,958 --> 00:42:51,499
Where's the famous Lee Hoi-chuen?

559
00:42:51,666 --> 00:42:54,665
What do you want? He's not here.

560
00:42:55,875 --> 00:42:58,499
Please have a seat, Mr Robinson.

561
00:42:58,666 --> 00:42:59,915
Serve tea.

562
00:43:00,083 --> 00:43:02,374
Want a smoke?

563
00:43:08,041 --> 00:43:09,499
A cigarette

564
00:43:09,666 --> 00:43:12,540
won't make your trouble go away.

565
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:17,207
If your husband is an ordinary smoker,

566
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,957
it'd be simple, but

567
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:24,332
he's into that. . .

568
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,040
Men, take action. Search the house.

569
00:43:26,208 --> 00:43:26,915
Yes, sir.

570
00:43:27,083 --> 00:43:28,040
What are you looking for?

571
00:43:28,208 --> 00:43:30,249
You know damn well.

572
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:31,999
Phoenix.

573
00:43:32,291 --> 00:43:34,040
I know you. Traitor.

574
00:43:34,208 --> 00:43:35,665
What are you doing here?

575
00:43:37,541 --> 00:43:39,040
I know you too.

576
00:43:39,208 --> 00:43:40,374
You're the old maid.

577
00:43:40,541 --> 00:43:42,374
Don't argue with him, Auntie.

578
00:43:52,791 --> 00:43:54,290
Hong Kong is British colony.

579
00:43:54,458 --> 00:43:56,082
You are under British law.

580
00:43:56,250 --> 00:44:00,874
Smoking opium is a very serious offense,
do you understand?

581
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:23,915
My husband always smokes when he is performing.

582
00:44:24,083 --> 00:44:28,957
This is a very common habit
among all entertainers.

583
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:30,582
For your information, Sir.

584
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:36,624
Smoking opium is a tradition that
was left from the last Chinese empire.

585
00:44:36,791 --> 00:44:38,832
The British caused the Opium War, didn't they?

586
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,249
Shut up, Phoenix.

587
00:44:48,041 --> 00:44:52,707
Mr Robinson, is there any way at all

588
00:44:52,875 --> 00:44:54,624
that you could perhaps...

589
00:44:54,791 --> 00:44:56,957
over the situation?

590
00:44:59,458 --> 00:45:02,790
Of course.

591
00:45:04,125 --> 00:45:08,457
But that'll depend on you.

592
00:45:14,625 --> 00:45:15,999
Here. Treat yourself to a meal.

593
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:21,165
We have a very big precinct.

594
00:45:21,333 --> 00:45:22,915
Not to mention I don't fancy tea.

595
00:45:23,083 --> 00:45:25,040
The boys prefer to go drinking.

596
00:45:25,166 --> 00:45:27,249
How much do you want?

597
00:45:28,041 --> 00:45:30,040
Let's go straight to the chase.

598
00:45:30,166 --> 00:45:32,040
At least cough up a brown one.

599
00:45:32,166 --> 00:45:33,332
That's too greedy.

600
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,207
$500 can buy a flat in Sham Shui Po.

601
00:45:35,375 --> 00:45:37,457
It's your call.

602
00:45:37,625 --> 00:45:40,374
Why didn't they shoot a running dog like you?

603
00:45:40,541 --> 00:45:42,207
That's all I have.

604
00:45:46,333 --> 00:45:47,540
That'll do, Sir.

605
00:45:47,708 --> 00:45:49,790
Let's go.

606
00:45:50,041 --> 00:45:52,249
Shall we confiscate the evidence, Sir?

607
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,915
What evidence?

608
00:45:54,208 --> 00:45:56,332
We found nothing here today.

609
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:59,165
Ladies.

610
00:46:02,208 --> 00:46:03,832
See you later.

611
00:46:11,625 --> 00:46:13,124
Mother.

612
00:46:38,625 --> 00:46:40,665
What about your voice?

613
00:47:15,125 --> 00:47:15,999
Want a smoke?

614
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,290
It's bad for you. You should quit.

615
00:47:17,458 --> 00:47:19,999
This is nothing compared to my Father's addiction.

616
00:47:20,166 --> 00:47:22,499
When I'm bored,

617
00:47:22,666 --> 00:47:25,874
smoking helps me think.

618
00:47:26,166 --> 00:47:27,999
What's taking her so long?

619
00:47:28,166 --> 00:47:31,582
A girl should keep us waiting.

620
00:47:33,958 --> 00:47:35,415
Here she is.

621
00:47:39,458 --> 00:47:41,665
- You...
- I'm sorry.

622
00:47:41,833 --> 00:47:43,874
Relax. It's only right for a girl

623
00:47:44,041 --> 00:47:45,457
to keep a guy waiting.

624
00:47:45,625 --> 00:47:47,749
Let's go see "Rebel Without a Cause."

625
00:47:47,916 --> 00:47:49,415
James Dean is in it.

626
00:47:49,583 --> 00:47:50,665
That's what I want to see, too.

627
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:51,832
Are you Bruce Lee?

628
00:47:53,208 --> 00:47:54,249
Yes.

629
00:47:54,416 --> 00:47:55,957
Can I have your autograph?

630
00:47:56,125 --> 00:47:58,207
I'm a huge fan.

631
00:48:02,583 --> 00:48:03,624
Margaret, can I have yours too?

632
00:48:03,791 --> 00:48:04,999
My boyfriend likes you.

633
00:48:05,166 --> 00:48:06,290
Sure.

634
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:08,457
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

635
00:48:09,166 --> 00:48:10,540
You both have fans?

636
00:48:10,708 --> 00:48:11,957
Why not?

637
00:48:12,125 --> 00:48:14,332
I've never been to a studio.

638
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,332
When can you give me a tour?

639
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,874
- We'll do it now.
- Great. Let's go.

640
00:48:18,041 --> 00:48:19,207
Let me drive.

641
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:23,540
We're giving you the grand tour.

642
00:48:23,708 --> 00:48:26,540
You'll see

643
00:48:26,708 --> 00:48:28,665
the great Bruce Lee in action.

644
00:48:28,833 --> 00:48:31,999
You'll see Wong Fei-hung. He's my friend.

645
00:48:37,208 --> 00:48:38,540
Great

646
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:41,040
Phoenix.

647
00:48:42,041 --> 00:48:43,374
Ready.

648
00:48:43,541 --> 00:48:44,290
Scene 2.

649
00:48:44,458 --> 00:48:46,207
Action.

650
00:48:47,458 --> 00:48:51,040
Si-fung.

651
00:48:51,208 --> 00:48:52,624
What is it, Master Chung?

652
00:48:52,791 --> 00:48:54,915
Mother knows you're leaving.

653
00:48:55,083 --> 00:48:57,790
She wants me to give you $1 00.

654
00:48:57,958 --> 00:49:00,082
No, thank you.

655
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:02,540
Please give it back to her.

656
00:49:03,166 --> 00:49:04,707
That means you're angry with us.

657
00:49:06,166 --> 00:49:08,290
I'm sorry about what happened today.

658
00:49:08,916 --> 00:49:11,249
I didn't mean it.

659
00:49:11,416 --> 00:49:14,499
I'm sorry about what happened today.

660
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:20,415
Master Chung, take me. . .

661
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:25,332
Si-fung, let's go inside the woodshed.

662
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:29,665
Cut. Who's laughing?

663
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:31,749
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

664
00:49:31,916 --> 00:49:34,749
You again? Stop messing around.

665
00:49:34,916 --> 00:49:37,165
Let's do it again.

666
00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:39,707
It's him. I'm not to blame.

667
00:49:43,208 --> 00:49:45,915
I'm romancing her and you're laughing.

668
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:48,374
Your look not only makes me laugh.

669
00:49:48,541 --> 00:49:49,749
It makes me want to puke.

670
00:49:49,916 --> 00:49:52,082
Want to puke now?

671
00:49:53,291 --> 00:49:54,582
This is boring. . .

672
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:55,624
Anything more exciting?

673
00:49:55,791 --> 00:49:57,582
Melodrama is definitely boring.

674
00:49:57,750 --> 00:49:59,915
I'll show you something awesome.

675
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:01,832
Let's go.

676
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,957
This is another world.

677
00:50:06,458 --> 00:50:07,749
This is not only a studio.

678
00:50:08,041 --> 00:50:10,332
It's also a playground.

679
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:12,707
Phoenix, let's go see Chun Siu-lei.

680
00:50:12,875 --> 00:50:14,499
Who's that?

681
00:50:14,666 --> 00:50:17,040
She's the lead in "Lady Tan Kei"?

682
00:50:17,208 --> 00:50:18,707
Skinny, you are such a loser.

683
00:50:18,875 --> 00:50:20,457
You're a lecherous cat.

684
00:50:21,041 --> 00:50:21,832
Wong Fei-hung Vs Shek Kin.

685
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:22,999
That's Shek Kin.

686
00:50:23,166 --> 00:50:24,124
Where's Wong Fei-hung?

687
00:50:24,333 --> 00:50:27,332
Just focus on me.

688
00:50:32,333 --> 00:50:33,082
Kin,

689
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:35,249
you guys will kick down the door.

690
00:50:35,416 --> 00:50:37,999
Wah, your Leung Foon comes from over there.

691
00:50:38,166 --> 00:50:40,124
Let's do it.

692
00:50:40,333 --> 00:50:41,457
Wait.

693
00:50:41,625 --> 00:50:42,915
Shall we do the fight scene as well?

694
00:50:43,083 --> 00:50:43,957
Of course.

695
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:45,957
You don't scare me.

696
00:50:46,125 --> 00:50:49,124
I won't go easy on you.

697
00:50:52,375 --> 00:50:55,082
I'm a martial artist too.

698
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:57,832
Are you ready?

699
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:58,749
Anytime.

700
00:50:58,916 --> 00:50:59,832
Come on.

701
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,457
Everyone, stand by.

702
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:03,207
- It's rolling
- Here we go.

703
00:51:03,375 --> 00:51:05,374
Ready. Camera.

704
00:51:10,291 --> 00:51:11,457
If you won't mind your own business,

705
00:51:11,625 --> 00:51:13,249
you must deal with me.

706
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:18,457
Who are you?

707
00:51:18,625 --> 00:51:19,832
My Master is in Guangzhou.

708
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,874
You can take it up with me.

709
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:26,665
I'm here to settle a score.

710
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:29,332
Wise up and step aside,

711
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,290
or else. . .

712
00:51:33,041 --> 00:51:34,874
Tear down the Po Chi Lam sign.

713
00:51:38,208 --> 00:51:39,332
Here we go.

714
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:40,707
This is the notorious Uncle Kin.

715
00:51:44,541 --> 00:51:46,207
How dare you.

716
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:50,707
Uncle Kin is so cool.

717
00:51:54,833 --> 00:51:56,374
Stop.

718
00:51:58,416 --> 00:51:59,749
What now?

719
00:52:00,375 --> 00:52:02,582
You're not supposed to grab my face.

720
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:05,749
I got carried away. It looks better that way.

721
00:52:05,916 --> 00:52:07,124
I have another shoot.

722
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:09,082
Don't mess up my face.

723
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:11,540
Come on, let's do it again.

724
00:52:11,708 --> 00:52:13,082
Let's...

725
00:52:13,875 --> 00:52:15,457
Mr Iron Man?

726
00:52:18,125 --> 00:52:19,540
He's rusty.

727
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:22,707
Chun Siu-lei isn't here or I'll introduce you.

728
00:52:22,875 --> 00:52:24,124
- Uncle Wah.
- Uncle Wah.

729
00:52:24,291 --> 00:52:26,874
Bruce, can I take a picture with him?

730
00:52:27,041 --> 00:52:29,457
Can my friend take a picture with you?

731
00:52:29,583 --> 00:52:30,749
Sure.

732
00:52:30,916 --> 00:52:32,374
I'll get that.

733
00:52:33,458 --> 00:52:35,790
1 , 2, 3.

734
00:52:36,166 --> 00:52:37,749
I'm counting on you for tomorrow's shoot.

735
00:52:37,916 --> 00:52:39,207
- OK.
- Better fight well.

736
00:52:39,375 --> 00:52:41,582
- Uncle Kin.
- You can count on me.

737
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:44,457
Getting yourself in trouble again?

738
00:52:44,625 --> 00:52:46,457
No, I'm here to learn something.

739
00:52:46,625 --> 00:52:47,624
Uncle Kin.

740
00:52:47,875 --> 00:52:50,249
I'll take a picture for you.

741
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:51,582
Thanks, Uncle Kin.

742
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:52,790
Phoenix.

743
00:52:52,958 --> 00:52:54,957
You boys are showing off

744
00:52:55,125 --> 00:52:57,290
in Kowloon City, eh?

745
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,207
- No.
- No.

746
00:52:59,375 --> 00:53:00,957
Look over here.

747
00:53:01,125 --> 00:53:01,790
Tigers...

748
00:53:01,958 --> 00:53:02,790
of. . .

749
00:53:02,958 --> 00:53:03,499
Kowloon. . .

750
00:53:03,666 --> 00:53:05,249
City.

751
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:09,374
- See you around.
- Thanks.

752
00:53:09,541 --> 00:53:11,749
Uncle Kin, can I take a picture of you?

753
00:53:12,125 --> 00:53:13,707
With him?

754
00:53:15,208 --> 00:53:16,624
I'll do it.

755
00:53:16,791 --> 00:53:18,040
You're too good a fighter.

756
00:53:18,208 --> 00:53:19,874
Who else?

757
00:53:20,458 --> 00:53:23,040
Uncle Kin, I really admire you.

758
00:53:27,333 --> 00:53:28,124
Don't laugh.

759
00:53:28,291 --> 00:53:31,457
Look over here, 1 , 2, 3.

760
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,707
Tigers.

761
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:35,665
Brats.

762
00:53:37,625 --> 00:53:38,832
Thank you.

763
00:53:39,166 --> 00:53:41,832
Let me buy you a drink.

764
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,790
No thanks, I'm playing dominoes.

765
00:53:45,958 --> 00:53:47,707
Next time, drop by my place.

766
00:53:47,875 --> 00:53:50,040
- Alright.
- It's a deal.

767
00:54:05,083 --> 00:54:08,040
The second day of the Chinese New Year
was always rowdy for us,

768
00:54:08,208 --> 00:54:11,290
because it was also Auntie Ngan's birthday.

769
00:54:11,458 --> 00:54:14,415
Father's friends from work

770
00:54:14,583 --> 00:54:16,540
would drop by.

771
00:54:23,291 --> 00:54:24,915
You two have been making fun
of Big Sis, haven't you.

772
00:54:25,083 --> 00:54:26,332
- You scared us.
- Got away.

773
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:27,499
Just ignore him.

774
00:54:27,666 --> 00:54:30,040
Tell Wah to take it easy.

775
00:54:30,208 --> 00:54:33,582
Filming night and day is bad for his health.

776
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:36,582
I know, that's why I'm making him...

777
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:37,957
sleep in right now.

778
00:54:38,125 --> 00:54:41,915
He should spend more time with his family.

779
00:54:42,083 --> 00:54:43,082
Sixty Thousand.

780
00:54:43,375 --> 00:54:44,582
You're so right.

781
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:46,874
Pearl is back and he has no time for her.

782
00:54:47,041 --> 00:54:47,874
Really?

783
00:54:48,041 --> 00:54:51,165
Tell him there's always money to earn.

784
00:54:51,333 --> 00:54:53,082
Am I right, Mui Yee?

785
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:54,540
Game.

786
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:55,957
Not when I'm on a draw.

787
00:54:56,125 --> 00:54:58,665
- You're missing a tile.
- What?

788
00:54:58,833 --> 00:55:00,749
Because you couldn't

789
00:55:00,916 --> 00:55:02,249
take your eyes off her.

790
00:55:02,416 --> 00:55:03,540
You're already wearing glasses.

791
00:55:03,708 --> 00:55:05,249
I knew I had a 6 Circles. Where did it go?

792
00:55:05,416 --> 00:55:07,207
Where did it go?

793
00:55:08,083 --> 00:55:09,374
Pay up.

794
00:55:09,625 --> 00:55:11,832
Come and eat a birthday bun.

795
00:55:15,416 --> 00:55:19,124
Let's eat, we'll play later.

796
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:22,499
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

797
00:55:28,083 --> 00:55:31,749
- Happy birthday, Auntie Ngan.
- Happy birthday.

798
00:55:34,041 --> 00:55:34,915
Master Phoenix is back.

799
00:55:35,083 --> 00:55:37,249
Kong, come with me for red packets.

800
00:55:37,416 --> 00:55:38,540
Phoenix.

801
00:55:41,416 --> 00:55:41,957
Auntie Ngan.

802
00:55:42,166 --> 00:55:45,707
You're home. Have a birthday bun.

803
00:55:46,291 --> 00:55:46,790
Happy birthday.

804
00:55:47,041 --> 00:55:48,457
Kong, this is my Auntie Ngan.

805
00:55:48,625 --> 00:55:49,790
Happy birthday.

806
00:55:49,958 --> 00:55:50,790
Thanks.

807
00:55:50,958 --> 00:55:52,665
Go inside and say hello.

808
00:55:54,666 --> 00:55:55,540
Thanks.

809
00:55:56,125 --> 00:55:58,665
- Father.
- Phoenix.

810
00:55:59,375 --> 00:56:00,665
This is my good friend Lau Lin-kong.

811
00:56:00,833 --> 00:56:02,790
Kung Hei Fat Choy.

812
00:56:02,958 --> 00:56:04,124
Give him a red packet.

813
00:56:04,291 --> 00:56:06,790
- Come.
- Thanks. Kung Hei Fat Choy.

814
00:56:07,958 --> 00:56:09,540
Kung Hei Fat Choy. Thanks.

815
00:56:09,708 --> 00:56:11,082
This is for you, Phoenix.

816
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:12,999
- Auntie Tso.
- Phoenix, Come here.

817
00:56:14,125 --> 00:56:17,540
This is from me and Uncle Wah.

818
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:18,249
Thanks, Auntie Tso.

819
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:20,999
Put it away properly and be good.

820
00:56:22,833 --> 00:56:26,290
Margaret's been waiting for you all morning.

821
00:56:26,458 --> 00:56:27,999
Come here, Kong

822
00:56:29,333 --> 00:56:30,415
Peter. Margaret.

823
00:56:30,583 --> 00:56:32,290
I've waited for you all morning.

824
00:56:32,458 --> 00:56:34,915
Meet my elder brother Peter and my sisters.

825
00:56:35,083 --> 00:56:36,040
Hello.

826
00:56:36,208 --> 00:56:38,540
You have a big family.

827
00:56:38,916 --> 00:56:39,999
Where's Skinny?

828
00:56:40,166 --> 00:56:41,624
In the back.

829
00:56:41,791 --> 00:56:43,415
- Let's go get him.
- OK.

830
00:56:43,583 --> 00:56:44,665
Play with me, Sloppy Cat.

831
00:56:44,833 --> 00:56:46,999
OK, let the girls stay here.

832
00:56:47,166 --> 00:56:48,374
We'll go outside.

833
00:56:50,708 --> 00:56:52,665
You barely finished 4 rounds.

834
00:56:52,833 --> 00:56:55,874
Chor-fan wants me to relay a message.

835
00:56:56,041 --> 00:56:58,040
Stay away from sloppy films.

836
00:56:58,208 --> 00:57:02,499
Make more films for Union and
do your share for qualify Cantonese films.

837
00:57:03,375 --> 00:57:05,749
I'm really flattered, but as you know,

838
00:57:05,916 --> 00:57:10,124
I've 30 mouths to feed. I must keep working.

839
00:57:11,166 --> 00:57:12,832
Tell Chor-fan,

840
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,040
I'll be there if he needs me.

841
00:57:17,208 --> 00:57:19,290
Alright. I have to go.

842
00:57:19,458 --> 00:57:20,874
- Kung Hei Fat Choy.
- Kung Hei Fat Choy.

843
00:57:21,083 --> 00:57:23,207
Come on.

844
00:57:23,375 --> 00:57:25,207
Bet more, win more.

845
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,540
I bet on everything.

846
00:57:28,041 --> 00:57:30,040
Bet on it, bet on it.

847
00:57:31,541 --> 00:57:33,040
No more bets.

848
00:57:33,375 --> 00:57:37,082
- Come on.
- Come on.

849
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:41,290
All chickens. Clean sweep, thank you.

850
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:42,915
Kung Hei Fat Choy.

851
00:57:45,125 --> 00:57:45,999
Skinny.

852
00:57:46,166 --> 00:57:47,457
You're here.

853
00:57:47,625 --> 00:57:49,332
Let's play.

854
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:50,749
You like to gamble?

855
00:57:50,916 --> 00:57:54,082
No, only for the New Year.

856
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:55,457
Come and sit.

857
00:57:56,708 --> 00:57:58,665
- Kung Hei Fat Choy.
- Kung Hei Fat Choy.

858
00:57:58,833 --> 00:58:00,457
What a crowd.

859
00:58:00,625 --> 00:58:02,790
- Your daughter?
- Kung Hei Fat Choy.

860
00:58:03,208 --> 00:58:04,249
Yes, say hello to Auntie.

861
00:58:04,416 --> 00:58:05,249
What's your name?

862
00:58:05,416 --> 00:58:07,582
Bobo Fung. I'm 4 years old.

863
00:58:07,791 --> 00:58:12,040
I wish Uncle Chuen a prosperous New Year.

864
00:58:13,583 --> 00:58:16,790
Thank you. Give her a red packet.

865
00:58:16,916 --> 00:58:19,082
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

866
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:20,040
Let's play there, ok?

867
00:58:20,208 --> 00:58:21,790
Come with me.

868
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:25,790
Why bring all this?

869
00:58:25,916 --> 00:58:28,790
It's nothing. Where's Phoenix?

870
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,707
In the back.

871
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:33,124
They ain't kids anymore.

872
00:58:33,291 --> 00:58:35,457
I envy you. Your kids are all grown up.

873
00:58:35,625 --> 00:58:38,624
You'll be off the hook soon. Mine is only 4.

874
00:58:38,791 --> 00:58:42,124
She's smart and cute.

875
00:58:42,291 --> 00:58:44,665
Put her in a film.

876
00:58:45,541 --> 00:58:47,624
Right. Keep it in the family.

877
00:58:48,583 --> 00:58:52,582
I'll tell you the story about Snow White.

878
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:54,332
- Come on.
- Believe it or not.

879
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:56,832
3 Chickens again.

880
00:58:58,166 --> 00:58:59,540
What are you doing here?

881
00:58:59,708 --> 00:59:01,749
I've been here since I was a kid.

882
00:59:01,916 --> 00:59:04,165
I know them very well.

883
00:59:04,333 --> 00:59:06,207
Who's talking? Your house is so big.

884
00:59:06,375 --> 00:59:07,999
When will you give us a tour?

885
00:59:08,166 --> 00:59:11,249
There's nobody there.

886
00:59:12,916 --> 00:59:13,999
What about your parents?

887
00:59:14,333 --> 00:59:16,582
They're never in Hong Kong.

888
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:19,499
Even if they are, they're never home.

889
00:59:19,666 --> 00:59:21,957
It's always just me and the servants.

890
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:24,749
That's better than me. My house is tiny.

891
00:59:24,916 --> 00:59:26,374
I can't stay there.

892
00:59:26,541 --> 00:59:27,665
I like it better here.

893
00:59:27,833 --> 00:59:30,665
Let's all go inside for a picture.

894
00:59:30,875 --> 00:59:32,665
- Come on.
- Let's go.

895
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:38,415
3, 2, 1 . Smile.

896
00:59:43,541 --> 00:59:45,499
No need to go to work today?

897
00:59:45,666 --> 00:59:47,040
A leading man can decide

898
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:48,999
when to go to work.

899
00:59:49,166 --> 00:59:50,290
- Really?
- I will go to work at 3.

900
00:59:50,458 --> 00:59:52,165
What about Skinny and Kong?

901
00:59:52,375 --> 00:59:54,082
We're here to work.

902
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:57,124
You think it's really fun to watch filming?

903
00:59:57,541 --> 00:59:58,374
Today will be awesome.

904
00:59:58,541 --> 01:00:02,207
Uncle Wah and Yu So-chow are filming a wuxia film.

905
01:00:02,375 --> 01:00:03,749
Keep watching and be quiet.

906
01:00:05,375 --> 01:00:06,374
Action.

907
01:00:06,708 --> 01:00:07,749
Now that you have completed your training,

908
01:00:07,916 --> 01:00:10,040
you may seek revenge.

909
01:00:10,208 --> 01:00:11,374
But remember. . .

910
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:15,040
you must always help the needy.

911
01:00:15,208 --> 01:00:17,582
Master, thanks for rescuing me 1 8 years ago.

912
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:21,832
I'll find my parents' killer and avenge them.

913
01:00:26,041 --> 01:00:27,957
Cut. Where's the dubbing artist?

914
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:29,499
- Dubbing artist.
- Where is she?

915
01:00:30,083 --> 01:00:30,999
Right here.

916
01:00:31,333 --> 01:00:32,874
I'm sorry.

917
01:00:33,041 --> 01:00:34,249
- No problem.
- No problem.

918
01:00:34,416 --> 01:00:35,540
I'm sorry.

919
01:00:36,083 --> 01:00:37,124
Let's do it again.

920
01:00:37,291 --> 01:00:39,082
Ready. Action.

921
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:42,415
You're leaving?

922
01:00:42,666 --> 01:00:44,540
I'll leave you two alone.

923
01:00:45,916 --> 01:00:47,790
I don't know

924
01:00:47,958 --> 01:00:49,874
when I'll be back.

925
01:00:50,041 --> 01:00:53,582
No, I'll tell Father I'm going with you.

926
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:55,290
Yu So-chow is so amazing.

927
01:00:55,458 --> 01:00:58,165
I think the dubbing artist is more amazing.

928
01:00:58,333 --> 01:01:00,790
Cut. Done. Get ready for the next scene.

929
01:01:00,958 --> 01:01:02,749
Uncle Wah & Ms Yu, we are waiting for you.

930
01:01:02,916 --> 01:01:03,999
Be right there.

931
01:01:04,166 --> 01:01:05,790
Sorry, Mr Koo, they want me for another film.

932
01:01:05,958 --> 01:01:09,040
They're filming "The Story of Wang Ying" next door.
Let's go watch.

933
01:01:09,208 --> 01:01:10,207
No.

934
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:11,582
Come on.

935
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:15,249
I'm tired. I need a break.

936
01:01:17,583 --> 01:01:20,999
- Hurry.
- Go change.

937
01:01:21,125 --> 01:01:22,915
Give me your best. Lights off.

938
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:30,707
Miss Wang, I wish you'll cooperate with us.

939
01:01:32,125 --> 01:01:34,999
If I didn't why else

940
01:01:35,125 --> 01:01:37,457
did I call you, Inspector?

941
01:03:12,125 --> 01:03:14,665
Are you OK?

942
01:03:36,666 --> 01:03:37,499
Bruce.

943
01:03:37,666 --> 01:03:38,540
What?

944
01:03:38,708 --> 01:03:40,332
Come, sign your name.

945
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:42,332
You're selling my autographs again?

946
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:44,457
Hurry. We're waiting for you.

947
01:03:44,625 --> 01:03:45,999
That's my signature. Isn't it nice?

948
01:03:46,166 --> 01:03:47,124
It's your turn.

949
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:48,790
Come here.

950
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:50,124
Today is Mom's birthday.

951
01:03:50,291 --> 01:03:51,624
We're giving her an English album.

952
01:03:51,791 --> 01:03:54,499
I thought Robert's

953
01:03:54,666 --> 01:03:56,374
selling my autograph.

954
01:03:56,583 --> 01:03:57,415
Who do you think you are? Tso Tat-wah?

955
01:03:57,583 --> 01:03:58,999
Who'd want your autograph?

956
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:02,874
Someday,

957
01:04:03,625 --> 01:04:06,082
the entire world will want my autograph.

958
01:04:08,625 --> 01:04:09,457
Who are we missing?

959
01:04:09,625 --> 01:04:11,165
Me.

960
01:04:15,791 --> 01:04:17,124
Like motif writing.

961
01:04:17,291 --> 01:04:18,874
What do you know?

962
01:04:19,041 --> 01:04:20,790
It's ugly.

963
01:04:20,958 --> 01:04:23,790
Agnes, does Uncle Wah have a daughter?

964
01:04:23,958 --> 01:04:27,249
Why don't you ask Mrs Tso?

965
01:04:41,208 --> 01:04:43,499
They buy the soy sauce, I buy the chicken.

966
01:04:43,666 --> 01:04:48,207
They buy you an album, I pay for the machine.

967
01:04:49,958 --> 01:04:53,499
It's in English. You understand this?

968
01:04:53,666 --> 01:04:55,665
As long as you like it.

969
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:12,832
Happy birthday.

970
01:05:13,791 --> 01:05:16,499
I thought you forgot.

971
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:19,207
No way.

972
01:05:20,208 --> 01:05:24,582
I remember it better than my lines.

973
01:05:27,375 --> 01:05:28,832
20 years ago,

974
01:05:29,708 --> 01:05:32,124
we pledged our love on your birthday.

975
01:05:33,541 --> 01:05:35,874
These last 20 years have been tough on you.

976
01:05:39,333 --> 01:05:43,332
You come from a rich family and
married an actor like me

977
01:05:44,333 --> 01:05:46,374
and raised my children.

978
01:05:48,166 --> 01:05:49,374
Thank you.

979
01:05:49,541 --> 01:05:50,790
What for?

980
01:05:52,041 --> 01:05:57,332
You worked hard for this family too.

981
01:05:58,875 --> 01:06:02,415
Like I always say, the family must...

982
01:06:02,583 --> 01:06:06,790
Live happily together.

983
01:06:08,125 --> 01:06:09,999
I "larve" you.

984
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:17,374
It's I "love" you.

985
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:22,915
Those brats are listening outside our door.

986
01:06:29,875 --> 01:06:34,582
I love you.

987
01:06:34,916 --> 01:06:37,082
Who taught you to say something so corny?

988
01:06:38,875 --> 01:06:40,499
Leung Sing-po.

989
01:06:41,083 --> 01:06:43,290
I love you.

990
01:07:40,541 --> 01:07:42,415
Why are you following me?

991
01:07:42,958 --> 01:07:44,457
I'm not.

992
01:07:44,791 --> 01:07:48,540
You want to say something?

993
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:52,915
You're Uncle Wah's daughter?

994
01:07:53,125 --> 01:07:55,749
You're Bruce Lee, a.k.a. Phoenix.

995
01:07:55,916 --> 01:07:56,832
How did you know?

996
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,165
Do you know I'm one year older than you?

997
01:08:01,375 --> 01:08:03,665
Say hi to Uncle Chuen and Auntie Grace.

998
01:08:04,291 --> 01:08:05,665
Bye.

999
01:08:23,875 --> 01:08:25,332
Thank you, Bruce.

1000
01:08:26,291 --> 01:08:27,249
For what?

1001
01:08:29,250 --> 01:08:31,999
I don't particularly enjoy making friends.

1002
01:08:33,416 --> 01:08:35,999
I never had any good friends.

1003
01:08:36,291 --> 01:08:37,415
But I have one now

1004
01:08:37,541 --> 01:08:41,165
since I met you.

1005
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,207
Like you took me to the studio.

1006
01:08:43,375 --> 01:08:45,457
I really had fun.

1007
01:08:45,875 --> 01:08:49,040
And this food. . . it's delicious.

1008
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:52,499
If you didn't bring me,

1009
01:08:52,666 --> 01:08:53,832
I'll never know

1010
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,999
Hong Kong has such a place at night.

1011
01:08:56,166 --> 01:08:57,374
Don't exaggerate.

1012
01:08:57,541 --> 01:08:58,499
Really?

1013
01:08:58,666 --> 01:08:59,749
You're not so bad yourself.

1014
01:08:59,916 --> 01:09:02,707
You've been abroad,

1015
01:09:02,875 --> 01:09:06,874
unlike us parochial local boys.

1016
01:09:07,041 --> 01:09:08,957
Come on.

1017
01:09:10,083 --> 01:09:11,457
Cheers.

1018
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,457
Tell me about your dream.

1019
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:25,999
My dream? I'm greedy.

1020
01:09:27,416 --> 01:09:29,415
I want to do something no one's done before.

1021
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:32,290
I want the world to know who I am.

1022
01:09:34,083 --> 01:09:35,499
You're in the movies.

1023
01:09:35,666 --> 01:09:38,249
Many people in Hong Kong know

1024
01:09:38,416 --> 01:09:39,832
Bruce Lee.

1025
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,249
That's not enough.

1026
01:09:41,416 --> 01:09:44,874
I'm talking about worldwide.

1027
01:09:46,916 --> 01:09:48,290
That's too greedy.

1028
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:51,915
What about you?

1029
01:09:52,833 --> 01:09:53,749
Me?

1030
01:09:54,791 --> 01:10:00,040
I wanted to be many things: a scientist,

1031
01:10:00,291 --> 01:10:02,415
a pilot, etc, etc.

1032
01:10:02,583 --> 01:10:04,124
Now that I'm older,

1033
01:10:04,291 --> 01:10:06,790
I know I've been naive.

1034
01:10:06,958 --> 01:10:09,165
Nothing is ever that simple.

1035
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,915
I should be practical, find a girl

1036
01:10:15,666 --> 01:10:17,540
and be nice to her,

1037
01:10:18,166 --> 01:10:19,957
take over my Dad's business,

1038
01:10:20,458 --> 01:10:24,249
get married and have lots of kids.

1039
01:10:24,625 --> 01:10:25,874
No way.

1040
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,832
You must not give in.

1041
01:10:35,291 --> 01:10:36,665
I'm confident you can do it.

1042
01:10:36,833 --> 01:10:38,165
You can do it.

1043
01:10:38,791 --> 01:10:41,082
Right, buddy.

1044
01:10:45,583 --> 01:10:48,290
Turn like this.

1045
01:10:50,375 --> 01:10:52,540
Let's take a break.

1046
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:56,165
Sir?

1047
01:10:56,750 --> 01:10:57,540
Sing-po.

1048
01:10:57,708 --> 01:10:59,290
What took you so long?

1049
01:10:59,458 --> 01:11:03,165
With all those stairs? You must be kidding.

1050
01:11:04,583 --> 01:11:06,457
Want one?

1051
01:11:07,583 --> 01:11:08,707
I've quit.

1052
01:11:08,958 --> 01:11:11,165
I come here to practice Tai Chi each morning.

1053
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:14,207
The air is fresh here. I'm healthier now.

1054
01:11:14,375 --> 01:11:17,957
For your own good, get rid of that belly.

1055
01:11:18,125 --> 01:11:20,457
You're the leading man after all.

1056
01:11:20,625 --> 01:11:23,790
That's ancient history. Now I'm a comedian.

1057
01:11:23,958 --> 01:11:25,749
And you're taking my parts.

1058
01:11:28,375 --> 01:11:34,207
Smoke a cigar and act like the boss.

1059
01:11:34,375 --> 01:11:36,874
- Use your brain when you work.
- OK. OK.

1060
01:11:37,375 --> 01:11:39,332
I'm just kidding.

1061
01:11:39,875 --> 01:11:42,082
Comedians come in all sizes.

1062
01:11:42,250 --> 01:11:47,165
If fat Lady Tam can be a comedian, so can I.

1063
01:11:47,458 --> 01:11:49,790
We're family in the Cantonese opera world.

1064
01:11:50,583 --> 01:11:52,999
Why not become real family?

1065
01:11:54,250 --> 01:11:55,707
You mean. . .

1066
01:11:56,708 --> 01:11:57,874
Margaret and Phoenix?

1067
01:11:58,041 --> 01:12:02,332
My wife told me they're very close.

1068
01:12:02,958 --> 01:12:04,415
It's marvellous if that's true.

1069
01:12:04,625 --> 01:12:06,790
The brat is always up to no good.

1070
01:12:06,958 --> 01:12:09,249
It'd be great if she can keep him in line.

1071
01:12:16,166 --> 01:12:18,082
Phoenix, where's your Margaret?

1072
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:19,249
You mean your Margaret?

1073
01:12:19,416 --> 01:12:20,624
I wish.

1074
01:12:20,875 --> 01:12:25,957
Kong bought us soda.

1075
01:12:26,125 --> 01:12:28,790
Grab your own bottle.

1076
01:12:29,291 --> 01:12:31,832
We usually drink herbal tea.
You're buying us soda?

1077
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,540
What's the occasion?

1078
01:12:34,041 --> 01:12:35,499
I want you to meet my girlfriend.

1079
01:12:35,958 --> 01:12:38,290
She's coming.

1080
01:12:38,541 --> 01:12:40,165
So you're trying to act rich.

1081
01:12:40,458 --> 01:12:44,290
It's not an act, he is rich.

1082
01:12:44,458 --> 01:12:47,374
You never told us you have a girlfriend.

1083
01:12:47,541 --> 01:12:49,582
It never came up.

1084
01:12:49,750 --> 01:12:52,165
She just came back to Hong Kong.

1085
01:12:52,333 --> 01:12:55,082
What else did you not tell us?

1086
01:13:00,291 --> 01:13:02,749
What are you doing?

1087
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,499
Nothing, I'm playing a song.

1088
01:13:04,666 --> 01:13:07,707
Ours is still on, wait your turn.

1089
01:13:14,208 --> 01:13:16,249
Go outside if you want to quarrel.

1090
01:13:16,416 --> 01:13:18,332
Take your fight outside, young men.

1091
01:13:18,708 --> 01:13:20,374
Do you know who he is?

1092
01:13:20,541 --> 01:13:22,582
I know him from shit.

1093
01:13:23,875 --> 01:13:26,915
He's Charlie Owen,
the 3-time Inter-school Boxing champ.

1094
01:13:27,083 --> 01:13:31,249
Do you know who he is?

1095
01:13:32,583 --> 01:13:35,165
You gweilos are so ignorant.

1096
01:13:35,458 --> 01:13:37,707
He's Bruce Lee,

1097
01:13:37,833 --> 01:13:41,749
the best fighter in Hong Kong.

1098
01:13:43,333 --> 01:13:44,999
You heard of the Tigers of Kowloon City?

1099
01:13:45,166 --> 01:13:47,040
He's our chief.

1100
01:13:52,541 --> 01:13:53,707
So what if he's taller.

1101
01:13:53,875 --> 01:13:55,374
Don't worry, Phoenix.

1102
01:13:55,625 --> 01:13:57,207
He's wearing a girl's scarf.

1103
01:13:57,458 --> 01:13:58,457
Dwarf.

1104
01:13:58,625 --> 01:14:00,499
Don't move, it's toe-to-toe for them.

1105
01:14:00,666 --> 01:14:01,499
Damn dwarf.

1106
01:14:01,666 --> 01:14:02,624
You're jealous of our good looks?

1107
01:14:02,791 --> 01:14:04,457
Move it.

1108
01:14:29,416 --> 01:14:30,082
Phoenix.

1109
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:31,249
- Are you OK?
- Are you OK?

1110
01:14:31,416 --> 01:14:33,415
- Get up.
- Are you OK?

1111
01:14:33,791 --> 01:14:34,790
We're here for herbal tea,

1112
01:14:34,916 --> 01:14:37,415
not to fight, barbarian.

1113
01:14:38,708 --> 01:14:40,790
You look a tad disappointed.

1114
01:14:42,083 --> 01:14:44,082
You can fight me again when you're ready.

1115
01:14:44,625 --> 01:14:46,207
I don't understand what you say.

1116
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:49,499
Lau Lin-kong?

1117
01:14:50,250 --> 01:14:51,790
What's going on?

1118
01:14:52,791 --> 01:14:55,332
Those gweilos are ridiculous.

1119
01:14:56,791 --> 01:14:58,999
Let me introduce you, she's...

1120
01:14:59,166 --> 01:15:03,249
Forget it, we know her.

1121
01:15:03,625 --> 01:15:05,290
I didn't know you're friends.

1122
01:15:05,458 --> 01:15:07,124
Bruce is an old friend.

1123
01:15:07,291 --> 01:15:09,249
You knew each other?

1124
01:15:09,416 --> 01:15:12,832
I'm glad, let's go in for herbal tea.

1125
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,749
- Come on.
- Go.

1126
01:15:16,083 --> 01:15:17,332
Don't worry, we're fine.

1127
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:19,374
2 more seats, please.

1128
01:15:19,958 --> 01:15:21,415
Can't think of anything better to play?

1129
01:15:21,583 --> 01:15:23,374
Yup, it's poop.

1130
01:15:23,666 --> 01:15:27,832
I'll sign up for the next boxing tournament.

1131
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,749
It's one thing to get even,

1132
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,790
but that guy is a 3-time boxing champ.

1133
01:15:33,958 --> 01:15:36,165
Did you see his biceps?

1134
01:15:36,333 --> 01:15:39,249
His fist is as big as Sloppy Cat's head.

1135
01:15:39,416 --> 01:15:41,249
So? Phoenix has biceps too.

1136
01:15:41,416 --> 01:15:44,040
We still have 6 months. I can get a coach.

1137
01:15:44,208 --> 01:15:52,832
The profundity of Chinese martial arts.

1138
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,540
He can find a coach in some lofty mountain.

1139
01:15:58,333 --> 01:16:00,624
What mountain?

1140
01:16:00,791 --> 01:16:02,332
Victoria Peak or Lion Rock?

1141
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:03,874
You can be so stupid, Skinny.

1142
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,624
What do you think, Sloppy Cat?

1143
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,624
You're my brother,

1144
01:16:08,791 --> 01:16:11,374
you must learn Wing Chun.

1145
01:16:12,583 --> 01:16:13,624
Why?

1146
01:16:13,791 --> 01:16:14,999
Because

1147
01:16:15,166 --> 01:16:16,207
I know someone.

1148
01:16:16,666 --> 01:16:17,999
Who do you know?

1149
01:16:18,208 --> 01:16:19,415
You trust me?

1150
01:16:20,375 --> 01:16:21,332
Yes.

1151
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:25,957
Master Yip Man is bound to ask you

1152
01:16:26,125 --> 01:16:28,499
why you want to learn Wing Chun.
What will you tell him?

1153
01:16:28,666 --> 01:16:30,499
That I want to fight better.

1154
01:16:30,666 --> 01:16:32,249
Don't be so honest.

1155
01:16:32,416 --> 01:16:35,082
Why learn something if you won't use it?

1156
01:16:35,250 --> 01:16:37,082
That's the only way to tell if it works.

1157
01:16:37,708 --> 01:16:39,415
Why don't you learn to ride a bike too?

1158
01:16:40,916 --> 01:16:41,915
Let's go.

1159
01:16:52,750 --> 01:16:54,207
- Master.
- Master.

1160
01:16:54,375 --> 01:16:57,915
I'm not the Master. He's inside.

1161
01:16:58,083 --> 01:16:59,874
You're here to learn martial arts?

1162
01:17:00,041 --> 01:17:01,040
Yes.

1163
01:17:03,208 --> 01:17:04,790
- Did you bring money?
- Yes.

1164
01:17:06,083 --> 01:17:07,040
And you?

1165
01:17:07,208 --> 01:17:08,915
I can't afford it,

1166
01:17:09,041 --> 01:17:10,707
but you can teach me.

1167
01:17:13,375 --> 01:17:14,499
Master.

1168
01:17:14,916 --> 01:17:16,624
- Master.
- Master.

1169
01:17:16,916 --> 01:17:18,207
You're Bruce Lee?

1170
01:17:18,375 --> 01:17:19,624
Lee Hoi-chuen is your Father?

1171
01:17:19,791 --> 01:17:20,915
Yes.

1172
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:24,457
Why do you want to learn?
To fight or for your well-being?

1173
01:17:25,083 --> 01:17:27,582
I want to know why everyone is learning.

1174
01:17:28,458 --> 01:17:32,499
You need a coach, but you must practice.

1175
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,082
Master doesn't give lessons anymore.

1176
01:17:36,416 --> 01:17:37,749
I'll teach you the basics.

1177
01:17:37,916 --> 01:17:38,499
Thanks.

1178
01:17:38,666 --> 01:17:40,915
He took you in. Take a picture, hurry.

1179
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:46,457
Ready, 1 , 2, 3.

1180
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:57,582
Phoenix.

1181
01:17:57,750 --> 01:17:58,749
Uncle Chor-fan.

1182
01:17:58,916 --> 01:18:03,332
Can't you walk properly?

1183
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:05,124
I'm thinking of some moves.

1184
01:18:06,958 --> 01:18:09,124
I want you to play the lead in a film.

1185
01:18:09,458 --> 01:18:10,790
What's the name?

1186
01:18:11,041 --> 01:18:12,665
"The Orphan."

1187
01:18:13,958 --> 01:18:18,332
I'm financing it and will shoot it
in Eastman Color for the widescreen.

1188
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:20,165
That'll cost a lot of money.

1189
01:18:22,666 --> 01:18:28,582
One must not bite the hand that feeds him.

1190
01:18:29,750 --> 01:18:32,624
Even in films,

1191
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:37,665
one must take one's acting seriously.

1192
01:18:38,083 --> 01:18:40,665
I have always admired the Union spirit.

1193
01:18:41,083 --> 01:18:42,874
No, it should be the Ng Chor-fan spirit.

1194
01:18:43,166 --> 01:18:47,374
One for all and all for one.

1195
01:18:57,041 --> 01:18:58,374
Bruce.

1196
01:18:59,875 --> 01:19:02,582
I heard you're a great cha-cha dancer.

1197
01:19:03,708 --> 01:19:06,249
Will you be my partner at the dance contest?

1198
01:19:08,541 --> 01:19:10,082
Kong is good too.

1199
01:19:10,625 --> 01:19:12,249
But I want you to be my partner.

1200
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:15,415
Let me think about it.

1201
01:19:19,375 --> 01:19:21,249
Let me know.

1202
01:19:45,250 --> 01:19:48,332
This song is from Robert Chan of La Salle

1203
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:53,374
to Phoebe Lee of Maryknoll,
wishing she'll stay young forever.

1204
01:19:55,083 --> 01:19:58,624
Robert Chan really likes you.

1205
01:19:58,791 --> 01:20:00,749
Did he ask you out?

1206
01:20:00,916 --> 01:20:03,790
He'll have to take a number.

1207
01:20:03,958 --> 01:20:07,457
Patrick Tse has been calling her every night.

1208
01:20:07,625 --> 01:20:10,249
Don't talk nonsense.

1209
01:20:10,916 --> 01:20:13,415
Margaret, are you waiting for Phoenix?

1210
01:20:14,333 --> 01:20:16,999
I want him to fill out a form.

1211
01:20:17,625 --> 01:20:18,457
For what?

1212
01:20:18,875 --> 01:20:20,749
The Cha-cha contest.

1213
01:20:20,916 --> 01:20:23,915
Good. You make such a good team.

1214
01:20:36,458 --> 01:20:38,832
Why don't you want to dance with Margaret?

1215
01:20:41,041 --> 01:20:44,249
I know. You don't want Pearl to be jealous.

1216
01:20:47,541 --> 01:20:50,165
Then who'll be your partner?

1217
01:20:59,916 --> 01:21:01,790
- Sit well.
- Phoebe

1218
01:21:01,958 --> 01:21:03,457
Hurry up and overtake him.

1219
01:21:05,541 --> 01:21:06,082
Phoenix.

1220
01:21:06,250 --> 01:21:08,207
- Hurry up.
- It's real fast already.

1221
01:21:09,375 --> 01:21:10,832
Robert. Give me a hand.

1222
01:21:12,333 --> 01:21:14,207
Get your own soda.

1223
01:21:16,708 --> 01:21:17,957
Kong.

1224
01:21:18,541 --> 01:21:20,374
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

1225
01:21:20,541 --> 01:21:23,457
Margaret, let's go for a ride.

1226
01:21:24,250 --> 01:21:26,040
Phoenix, let's go.

1227
01:21:26,208 --> 01:21:27,374
Get off my case.

1228
01:21:27,541 --> 01:21:29,207
I can teach you.

1229
01:21:30,083 --> 01:21:32,540
What's wrong, Bruce? You're always so cocky.

1230
01:21:32,708 --> 01:21:34,374
Something finally shut you up?

1231
01:21:34,541 --> 01:21:35,874
Yeah. Remember last time?

1232
01:21:36,083 --> 01:21:37,540
It's all because he couldn't ride a bike.

1233
01:21:37,708 --> 01:21:38,915
We all took a beating as a result.

1234
01:21:39,083 --> 01:21:40,207
Not that again.

1235
01:21:41,166 --> 01:21:42,332
Thanks.

1236
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:43,374
Thanks to you.

1237
01:21:43,541 --> 01:21:45,165
1 , 2, 3.

1238
01:21:45,333 --> 01:21:47,499
OK

1239
01:21:48,333 --> 01:21:51,082
Kong, I'll take one of you and Pearl.

1240
01:21:51,250 --> 01:21:52,832
1 , 2, 3.

1241
01:21:53,208 --> 01:21:53,874
Not this one.

1242
01:21:54,041 --> 01:21:55,915
- Pass it to me.
- OK. Want one?

1243
01:21:56,125 --> 01:21:58,415
- I do.
- No more film.

1244
01:21:58,791 --> 01:22:00,249
Bruce, who'll be

1245
01:22:00,416 --> 01:22:02,415
your partner at the contest?

1246
01:22:04,291 --> 01:22:05,707
I don't know yet.

1247
01:22:07,125 --> 01:22:09,415
Why? You need a good partner for Cha-cha.

1248
01:22:09,583 --> 01:22:12,124
You and Margaret will make a good team.

1249
01:22:12,958 --> 01:22:14,832
We all make a good team, right?

1250
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,290
Stop taking pictures, Sloppy Cat.
Show us your moves.

1251
01:22:17,458 --> 01:22:18,415
No problem.

1252
01:22:23,208 --> 01:22:24,540
I'm really good.

1253
01:22:24,708 --> 01:22:27,707
You are, but not me.

1254
01:22:28,416 --> 01:22:30,040
Get someone else.

1255
01:22:35,708 --> 01:22:38,582
Margaret, I can be your partner.

1256
01:22:38,916 --> 01:22:41,957
Pearl doesn't want me.

1257
01:22:45,125 --> 01:22:48,040
That's because you're too good.

1258
01:22:48,208 --> 01:22:52,332
What's the matter with you?
You're all in this contest.

1259
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:54,332
You'll come in first and second.

1260
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:55,832
That'll be perfect.

1261
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,082
You make it sound so easy.

1262
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:00,665
If we go, we'll definitely come in third.

1263
01:23:00,833 --> 01:23:01,874
That's good.

1264
01:23:02,041 --> 01:23:03,665
Good my ass. Shut up.

1265
01:23:04,083 --> 01:23:05,624
I'll dance with you.

1266
01:23:07,583 --> 01:23:09,165
Phoenix, then you can dance with Margaret.

1267
01:23:09,333 --> 01:23:10,665
OK. OK.

1268
01:23:11,625 --> 01:23:13,165
I know what to do.

1269
01:23:16,083 --> 01:23:17,499
What's wrong with you lately?

1270
01:23:17,666 --> 01:23:19,749
You won't go to the movies with me.

1271
01:23:19,916 --> 01:23:22,374
You're never there when I go to your house.

1272
01:23:22,750 --> 01:23:23,499
Let me help you.

1273
01:23:23,666 --> 01:23:25,499
Is she or is she not your girlfriend?

1274
01:23:25,666 --> 01:23:27,249
Of course not.

1275
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:37,582
Damn you.

1276
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:40,332
- Whatever you say. Margaret.
- Margaret.

1277
01:24:17,916 --> 01:24:20,374
What about Phoebe and Agnes?

1278
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,374
They said Phoenix was...

1279
01:24:24,541 --> 01:24:27,415
I can't hear you, you talk like a girl.

1280
01:24:27,583 --> 01:24:32,499
They wouldn't root for
Phoenix as he was mean to Margaret.

1281
01:24:32,666 --> 01:24:35,665
Don't yell. I'm sitting right next to you.

1282
01:24:35,833 --> 01:24:39,082
See? She told you to shut up.

1283
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:49,749
After the first 4 pairs of contestants,

1284
01:24:49,916 --> 01:24:52,415
let's meet the next 4 pairs.

1285
01:24:52,583 --> 01:24:53,624
Look.

1286
01:24:53,791 --> 01:24:57,749
She wants to know who's Phoenix's partner.

1287
01:24:58,333 --> 01:25:01,165
He didn't pick a girl. She can't be jealous.

1288
01:25:01,333 --> 01:25:03,707
Lastly, the only all-boys team,

1289
01:25:03,875 --> 01:25:06,540
Brothers Bruce and Robert Lee.

1290
01:25:07,166 --> 01:25:08,790
Let's begin.

1291
01:25:54,458 --> 01:25:55,915
Margaret.

1292
01:25:56,666 --> 01:25:58,290
Don't be mad.

1293
01:25:58,791 --> 01:26:03,707
Phoenix didn't pick a girl.

1294
01:26:03,875 --> 01:26:04,957
Right?

1295
01:26:05,166 --> 01:26:07,665
Why won't he

1296
01:26:07,833 --> 01:26:08,999
dance with me?

1297
01:26:09,166 --> 01:26:10,999
- I know.
- What do you know?

1298
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:12,749
- What?
- I don't know. . .

1299
01:26:12,916 --> 01:26:15,040
He doesn't know anything.

1300
01:26:15,208 --> 01:26:17,290
Look at them. They're brilliant.

1301
01:26:54,916 --> 01:26:57,957
Let's invite all contestants to come out.

1302
01:27:06,083 --> 01:27:09,624
Ladies and gents, the winning team is. . .

1303
01:27:12,708 --> 01:27:16,040
Bruce and Robert Lee.

1304
01:27:17,208 --> 01:27:19,040
Phoenix.

1305
01:27:19,333 --> 01:27:22,457
And now the award ceremony.

1306
01:27:30,875 --> 01:27:32,332
Congratulations, Bruce Lee.

1307
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:33,374
Thanks.

1308
01:27:33,541 --> 01:27:34,749
Congratulations.

1309
01:27:36,083 --> 01:27:37,957
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

1310
01:27:41,541 --> 01:27:43,915
You won. Robert, let's take a pic outside.

1311
01:27:46,250 --> 01:27:47,582
Bruce.

1312
01:27:49,333 --> 01:27:50,707
I'm disappointed in you.

1313
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,165
What do you mean?

1314
01:27:53,375 --> 01:27:56,832
I know you really like Pearl.

1315
01:27:58,125 --> 01:27:58,874
I do not.

1316
01:27:59,041 --> 01:28:01,082
Pearl already told me.

1317
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,624
You turned her down because of me.

1318
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:10,957
Don't worry. I'll get out of the picture.

1319
01:28:11,125 --> 01:28:12,499
You got this all wrong.

1320
01:28:13,125 --> 01:28:15,374
You know me, Bruce.

1321
01:28:15,875 --> 01:28:19,207
I don't want handouts: not love,

1322
01:28:20,875 --> 01:28:23,249
and definitely not friendship.

1323
01:28:39,625 --> 01:28:43,915
Soon after that,
Kong, Margaret and Pearl stopped showing up.

1324
01:28:44,833 --> 01:28:47,207
For the first time, Bruce couldn't

1325
01:28:47,375 --> 01:28:50,582
settle a matter with his fists.

1326
01:28:52,625 --> 01:28:54,749
I have never seen him like this.

1327
01:28:55,458 --> 01:28:58,790
He was so quiet he seemed like another man.

1328
01:28:59,208 --> 01:29:00,999
It's 2 months before the boxing tournament.

1329
01:29:01,166 --> 01:29:04,957
He decided to focus on this quest.

1330
01:29:21,208 --> 01:29:22,249
Left hand.

1331
01:29:22,416 --> 01:29:23,540
Go.

1332
01:29:25,333 --> 01:29:26,624
Again.

1333
01:30:13,916 --> 01:30:15,457
Bruce. Telephone.

1334
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:21,957
Hello?

1335
01:30:22,125 --> 01:30:23,249
Bruce.

1336
01:30:23,416 --> 01:30:24,249
Pearl?

1337
01:30:24,416 --> 01:30:25,749
Are you free tomorrow?

1338
01:30:35,416 --> 01:30:36,915
I asked you out

1339
01:30:37,083 --> 01:30:39,165
because I need your help.

1340
01:30:39,458 --> 01:30:40,707
What is it?

1341
01:30:41,250 --> 01:30:43,040
Help me find Kong.

1342
01:30:43,708 --> 01:30:47,499
He's been missing for 2 weeks.

1343
01:30:49,083 --> 01:30:51,082
He's become a junkie.

1344
01:30:53,750 --> 01:30:55,832
All junkies buy from pushers.

1345
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,457
They are like brokers.

1346
01:30:58,791 --> 01:31:00,290
Sham Shui Po is full of them.

1347
01:31:00,458 --> 01:31:01,207
Sorry.

1348
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:03,290
How do you know all these?

1349
01:31:03,625 --> 01:31:06,249
There're all kinds of folks in a film studio.

1350
01:31:06,416 --> 01:31:07,790
It's not difficult to learn these things.

1351
01:31:07,958 --> 01:31:10,124
That's so unlike Kong. What happened to him?

1352
01:31:10,958 --> 01:31:12,957
I didn't expect him to be so weak.

1353
01:31:14,291 --> 01:31:16,665
It was my fault. I should look for him sooner.

1354
01:31:16,833 --> 01:31:18,374
Look at those two.

1355
01:31:18,541 --> 01:31:21,457
They look like gangsters. So scary.

1356
01:31:21,666 --> 01:31:25,124
He's a major pusher in the neighborhood.

1357
01:31:25,791 --> 01:31:27,832
Come, Skinny. We'll pretend to buy from him.

1358
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,290
OK.

1359
01:31:29,541 --> 01:31:32,499
Stay put, Phoenix. They may recognize you.

1360
01:31:33,125 --> 01:31:34,540
Be careful.

1361
01:31:41,333 --> 01:31:43,874
Are you ready for the boxing tournament?

1362
01:31:44,916 --> 01:31:46,249
Will you come?

1363
01:31:47,041 --> 01:31:48,874
No, I'm heading back to the U. K.

1364
01:31:50,250 --> 01:31:51,415
When?

1365
01:31:52,041 --> 01:31:53,665
Soon.

1366
01:31:54,416 --> 01:31:55,499
I'll come see you.

1367
01:31:56,916 --> 01:31:58,249
What for?

1368
01:32:01,791 --> 01:32:04,582
If I were your partner,

1369
01:32:04,750 --> 01:32:06,290
none of this would have happened.

1370
01:32:10,416 --> 01:32:12,165
If I met you before Kong,

1371
01:32:13,291 --> 01:32:14,499
you suppose we could be

1372
01:32:15,625 --> 01:32:17,290
good friends?

1373
01:32:19,333 --> 01:32:21,207
You cherish your friends too much.

1374
01:32:21,375 --> 01:32:23,665
That's why I know you'll find Kong.

1375
01:32:28,833 --> 01:32:30,290
Wrong place.

1376
01:32:30,458 --> 01:32:33,499
They don't know Kong.

1377
01:32:34,458 --> 01:32:35,707
What about the pusher?

1378
01:32:36,708 --> 01:32:38,165
I don't know.

1379
01:32:47,333 --> 01:32:52,165
Come on, Bruce.

1380
01:32:54,916 --> 01:32:59,207
Bruce...

1381
01:33:02,083 --> 01:33:03,415
Let the match begin.

1382
01:33:03,583 --> 01:33:08,082
Charlie Owen from King George V School.

1383
01:33:21,541 --> 01:33:24,457
And Bruce Lee from St. Francis Xavier.

1384
01:33:39,833 --> 01:33:42,540
- Come on, Phoenix.
- Come on, Phoenix.

1385
01:33:42,708 --> 01:33:45,040
You're from La Salle. Why root for him?

1386
01:33:45,208 --> 01:33:46,665
Because I know Bruce Lee.

1387
01:33:46,833 --> 01:33:48,207
He used to go to La Salle.

1388
01:33:48,375 --> 01:33:50,624
His brother Peter is my pal.

1389
01:33:50,875 --> 01:33:52,165
Really? What's your name?

1390
01:33:54,041 --> 01:33:56,790
James Wong. What about you, ladies?

1391
01:33:56,958 --> 01:34:00,124
Sit over there. This seat is taken.

1392
01:34:00,291 --> 01:34:01,540
Really?

1393
01:34:04,625 --> 01:34:06,915
Right, have a drink first.

1394
01:34:15,625 --> 01:34:16,915
I will give you 3 commands:

1395
01:34:17,083 --> 01:34:20,415
go, stop and split.

1396
01:34:21,166 --> 01:34:24,332
No elbows. Put on your mouth guard.

1397
01:34:29,416 --> 01:34:31,832
Punch him up for me.

1398
01:34:32,208 --> 01:34:33,874
Look at him. He's so cocky.

1399
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,457
You can do it, Phoenix.

1400
01:34:38,958 --> 01:34:40,124
Are you ready?

1401
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:44,374
Go.

1402
01:34:55,333 --> 01:34:57,540
- Phoebe. Agnes.
- Margaret.

1403
01:34:59,458 --> 01:35:00,582
Come on, Bruce.

1404
01:35:00,750 --> 01:35:02,082
Margaret, I'll swap seats with you.

1405
01:35:02,250 --> 01:35:03,624
Sure.

1406
01:35:12,291 --> 01:35:15,040
Good job, Charlie.

1407
01:35:21,041 --> 01:35:25,082
- Dodge
- Watch out, Phoenix.

1408
01:35:25,250 --> 01:35:27,040
- Good.
- Go on.

1409
01:35:45,166 --> 01:35:48,165
Watch his punch. . . be careful.

1410
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:54,207
Dodge.

1411
01:35:55,625 --> 01:35:57,124
Fight wisely

1412
01:36:18,666 --> 01:36:20,540
Phoenix.

1413
01:36:23,125 --> 01:36:23,999
Are you OK?

1414
01:36:24,125 --> 01:36:25,499
You're sure?

1415
01:36:26,208 --> 01:36:27,124
Good.

1416
01:36:27,708 --> 01:36:29,915
Come here, Phoenix. Sit down.

1417
01:36:30,166 --> 01:36:32,624
You OK, Phoenix?

1418
01:36:32,791 --> 01:36:34,749
Recognize me?

1419
01:36:34,916 --> 01:36:36,165
Give him some water.

1420
01:36:36,791 --> 01:36:38,082
- Water?
- Don't look at me.

1421
01:36:38,250 --> 01:36:40,124
You won't spill water if he finished it.

1422
01:36:40,291 --> 01:36:41,749
Get him another glass.

1423
01:36:50,916 --> 01:36:52,624
Good job, Finish him off.

1424
01:36:52,791 --> 01:36:54,332
All eyes are on you

1425
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:56,790
but no pressure. Go.

1426
01:36:59,291 --> 01:37:00,207
Go.

1427
01:37:35,708 --> 01:37:37,165
Bravo. Hit him hard.

1428
01:37:39,333 --> 01:37:41,040
Stop.

1429
01:37:41,166 --> 01:37:43,082
Don't move. Don't move.

1430
01:37:43,250 --> 01:37:44,749
Stop. You can't do this,

1431
01:37:44,916 --> 01:37:48,374
or I'll dock your points. Understand?

1432
01:37:49,125 --> 01:37:50,624
Good. Go.

1433
01:37:59,083 --> 01:38:00,374
Hit back, Phoenix.

1434
01:38:00,541 --> 01:38:02,124
Hurry up.

1435
01:38:51,791 --> 01:38:53,582
Split. Back to your corner.

1436
01:38:55,916 --> 01:38:57,915
It's over...

1437
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,790
Awesome, Phoenix.

1438
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:20,665
I knew we'd win.

1439
01:39:20,833 --> 01:39:21,665
Phoenix.

1440
01:39:21,833 --> 01:39:23,165
Brilliant, Phoenix.

1441
01:39:23,291 --> 01:39:25,624
You make the family proud.

1442
01:39:25,958 --> 01:39:27,624
I need to talk to you.

1443
01:39:28,458 --> 01:39:29,582
I didn't expect you to show up.

1444
01:39:29,958 --> 01:39:32,624
Of course. We grew up together.

1445
01:39:32,791 --> 01:39:34,207
We're pals.

1446
01:39:34,791 --> 01:39:36,457
Pals...

1447
01:39:36,791 --> 01:39:38,374
I never treated you like a boy,

1448
01:39:38,583 --> 01:39:41,082
so don't treat me like a girl.

1449
01:39:41,916 --> 01:39:42,957
We're buddies.

1450
01:39:43,791 --> 01:39:45,249
Buddies.

1451
01:39:47,291 --> 01:39:48,999
I got a letter for you.

1452
01:39:50,291 --> 01:39:52,124
Pearl has a letter for you.

1453
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:59,832
Bruce, I found out later you liked me.

1454
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:02,957
Why didn't you tell me from the get go?

1455
01:40:03,791 --> 01:40:05,999
When I was with Kong,

1456
01:40:06,916 --> 01:40:09,165
I thought you and Margaret were an item.

1457
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,957
Your behaviour in front of everyone

1458
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:14,999
led me to believe you didn't care.

1459
01:40:15,916 --> 01:40:18,832
What happened to Kong broke my heart.

1460
01:40:20,958 --> 01:40:22,832
I got to know you better

1461
01:40:23,333 --> 01:40:25,832
because of your selflessness to your friends.

1462
01:40:27,125 --> 01:40:30,665
But it's too late now.

1463
01:40:31,958 --> 01:40:34,124
I'm on a plane back to the U.K.

1464
01:40:34,625 --> 01:40:37,749
Until we meet again.

1465
01:41:18,083 --> 01:41:22,332
Charlie, it's not all the win, or lose.

1466
01:41:22,791 --> 01:41:23,790
It's one have to

1467
01:41:23,958 --> 01:41:26,457
learn from this experience.

1468
01:41:28,125 --> 01:41:30,499
Bruce Lee... he is so fast.

1469
01:41:33,416 --> 01:41:34,790
I want to fight again.

1470
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,582
Wow, Charlie, I am glad to
hear that you've recovered.

1471
01:41:37,958 --> 01:41:39,332
What is your plan?

1472
01:41:40,333 --> 01:41:42,582
Wow, I request to fight again.

1473
01:41:43,083 --> 01:41:44,915
So I give a message to his brother.

1474
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,332
Bruce Lee has a friend, Lau Lin-kong.

1475
01:41:49,125 --> 01:41:51,374
He's come into investigation with this department.

1476
01:41:51,541 --> 01:41:54,332
We think he's probably involved in drugs dealing.

1477
01:42:00,791 --> 01:42:02,832
Bruce Lee, this is Charlie Owen.

1478
01:42:04,291 --> 01:42:07,249
It's good fight, but I want to fight you again.

1479
01:42:08,791 --> 01:42:12,832
This match has no audience, no arena,

1480
01:42:13,125 --> 01:42:17,624
no gloves, no rules.

1481
01:42:19,125 --> 01:42:20,290
I want a re-match.

1482
01:44:24,458 --> 01:44:25,582
Again.

1483
01:46:30,708 --> 01:46:32,290
Are you OK?

1484
01:46:49,416 --> 01:46:51,249
I just thought of a new strategy.

1485
01:46:51,500 --> 01:46:53,415
Next time we fight, I'm going to win.

1486
01:46:54,250 --> 01:46:55,749
Fight again? Now?

1487
01:46:55,916 --> 01:46:57,249
No, thanks.

1488
01:46:58,166 --> 01:47:00,749
I think you broke my rib with your kick.

1489
01:47:02,208 --> 01:47:03,207
That was amazing.

1490
01:47:03,375 --> 01:47:05,249
You must teach me.

1491
01:47:09,875 --> 01:47:11,665
That's how street fights

1492
01:47:11,833 --> 01:47:13,707
differ from boxing.

1493
01:47:14,791 --> 01:47:19,290
Honestly, our match was pretty close.

1494
01:47:20,833 --> 01:47:21,999
But I've never been

1495
01:47:22,166 --> 01:47:25,915
beat down so bad.

1496
01:47:27,958 --> 01:47:29,790
You got potential to be a good fighter.

1497
01:47:29,958 --> 01:47:31,707
So do you, my friend.

1498
01:47:32,916 --> 01:47:35,665
Do you have a friend named Lau Lin-kong?

1499
01:47:37,416 --> 01:47:39,124
I've been looking for him.

1500
01:47:39,833 --> 01:47:42,290
My dad is superintendent. I know where he is.

1501
01:47:43,458 --> 01:47:47,290
Lau Lin-kong's parents are my dad's friends.

1502
01:47:47,541 --> 01:47:48,999
They reported him missing.

1503
01:47:49,958 --> 01:47:51,957
My dad sent out a detective to look for him.

1504
01:47:52,458 --> 01:47:55,874
He found out Kong's involved with
a drug house in the New Territories.

1505
01:47:56,041 --> 01:47:57,457
I think he's there.

1506
01:47:58,375 --> 01:47:59,415
Light a cigarette for me.

1507
01:47:59,666 --> 01:48:00,874
Get away.

1508
01:48:01,083 --> 01:48:03,290
- Give me a cigarette.
- Get away...

1509
01:48:11,791 --> 01:48:13,040
Recognize him?

1510
01:48:13,708 --> 01:48:14,832
Yes.

1511
01:48:15,500 --> 01:48:17,499
Especially that asshole in the back.

1512
01:48:29,708 --> 01:48:30,790
One by one.

1513
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:32,165
Get in line.

1514
01:48:35,375 --> 01:48:36,707
One by one.

1515
01:48:59,208 --> 01:49:01,082
We're done, let's go eat.

1516
01:49:01,541 --> 01:49:03,124
I'll walk you out, Boss.

1517
01:49:07,125 --> 01:49:08,624
When is the next shipment?

1518
01:49:08,791 --> 01:49:10,874
- I'll take care of that.
- Right.

1519
01:49:21,458 --> 01:49:22,999
Come with me, Sloppy Cat.

1520
01:49:23,625 --> 01:49:25,290
Skinny, you're on the lookout.

1521
01:49:25,458 --> 01:49:26,874
Call the cops if anything goes wrong.

1522
01:49:27,041 --> 01:49:29,249
Be careful, Phoenix. You too.

1523
01:49:36,583 --> 01:49:37,832
Kong.

1524
01:49:39,583 --> 01:49:41,207
Go away, leave me alone.

1525
01:49:42,208 --> 01:49:43,374
What happened to you?

1526
01:49:43,541 --> 01:49:45,124
We can talk about this.

1527
01:49:45,416 --> 01:49:46,790
Go away, leave me alone.

1528
01:49:46,916 --> 01:49:48,582
Pearl sent me.

1529
01:49:49,750 --> 01:49:51,165
We've been looking for you for 2 months.

1530
01:49:52,875 --> 01:49:57,499
Please don't tell her where I am.

1531
01:49:57,916 --> 01:49:59,207
I beg you.

1532
01:49:59,625 --> 01:50:01,499
She cares about you.

1533
01:50:03,541 --> 01:50:04,415
Let's go.

1534
01:50:04,583 --> 01:50:05,790
Leave me alone.

1535
01:50:05,916 --> 01:50:07,499
What's wrong with you, Kong?

1536
01:50:10,083 --> 01:50:14,457
Get money from my parents. I'm broke.

1537
01:50:14,625 --> 01:50:20,957
Wake up, Lau Lin-kong.

1538
01:50:22,583 --> 01:50:26,999
Leave me alone.

1539
01:50:27,875 --> 01:50:30,165
I don't need your mercy.

1540
01:50:30,625 --> 01:50:33,249
Especially you, Bruce Lee.

1541
01:50:33,666 --> 01:50:35,499
Bruce Lee.

1542
01:50:35,958 --> 01:50:38,790
Remember what you promised me?

1543
01:50:39,500 --> 01:50:41,165
Remember that?

1544
01:50:41,958 --> 01:50:46,874
You're going to be a pilot,

1545
01:50:47,208 --> 01:50:51,624
get married

1546
01:50:51,875 --> 01:50:54,624
and have kids.

1547
01:50:54,833 --> 01:50:56,832
Leave me alone.

1548
01:50:58,791 --> 01:51:00,957
Just turn back.

1549
01:51:01,125 --> 01:51:03,665
- Leave me alone.
- Go away.

1550
01:51:05,666 --> 01:51:06,207
Don't do this, Kong.

1551
01:51:06,375 --> 01:51:07,999
Get up.

1552
01:51:09,875 --> 01:51:11,540
What are you doing?

1553
01:51:11,875 --> 01:51:12,374
Kong.

1554
01:51:12,541 --> 01:51:15,665
I knew I saw you just now. Let go.

1555
01:51:18,375 --> 01:51:20,082
What's wrong with you?

1556
01:51:20,250 --> 01:51:22,832
It's the movie star Bruce Lee.

1557
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:24,790
I have such affinity with your family.

1558
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:26,874
Don't let them get away, Boss.

1559
01:51:27,041 --> 01:51:30,249
They'll probably squeal to the cops.

1560
01:51:30,500 --> 01:51:31,749
Boss.

1561
01:51:37,541 --> 01:51:42,124
What the hell.

1562
01:51:47,916 --> 01:51:49,707
Kong. You're OK.

1563
01:51:50,250 --> 01:51:54,082
Call the cops. Bruce is trapped.

1564
01:51:54,250 --> 01:51:55,790
What?

1565
01:51:59,166 --> 01:52:01,374
Do whatever, but don't mess with the goods.

1566
01:52:01,541 --> 01:52:02,790
Don't make me...

1567
01:52:02,958 --> 01:52:03,415
Phoenix.

1568
01:52:03,583 --> 01:52:05,457
If you toss that, you'll never get out alive.

1569
01:52:05,625 --> 01:52:08,082
You wouldn't dare.

1570
01:52:15,833 --> 01:52:17,249
Give me a hand, Sloppy Cat.

1571
01:52:19,666 --> 01:52:20,999
Sloppy Cat.

1572
01:52:26,958 --> 01:52:28,290
Help me open it.

1573
01:52:30,541 --> 01:52:31,790
There.

1574
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:36,124
Go up.

1575
01:52:40,750 --> 01:52:42,082
Give me your hand.

1576
01:52:48,791 --> 01:52:49,957
They're up there.

1577
01:52:58,000 --> 01:52:58,582
Get them.

1578
01:52:58,791 --> 01:52:59,915
Be careful, Boss.

1579
01:53:01,166 --> 01:53:02,832
Wrap your hand with this.

1580
01:53:09,458 --> 01:53:10,915
Don't move.

1581
01:53:12,166 --> 01:53:14,082
- Stop.
- Don't move.

1582
01:53:15,333 --> 01:53:18,457
Stop. Bruce Lee.

1583
01:53:18,958 --> 01:53:20,290
- Go.
- Hurry.

1584
01:53:21,541 --> 01:53:22,832
Get them.

1585
01:53:25,125 --> 01:53:27,874
- There. Hurry.
- Don't move.

1586
01:53:30,500 --> 01:53:31,624
Come on.

1587
01:53:32,958 --> 01:53:34,499
- Jump over.
- Come on.

1588
01:53:35,250 --> 01:53:37,707
Don't look, just jump.

1589
01:53:39,750 --> 01:53:40,999
Go.

1590
01:53:42,041 --> 01:53:43,040
You idiot.

1591
01:53:43,708 --> 01:53:45,999
Quick.

1592
01:53:47,875 --> 01:53:50,874
- Just go.
- Don't mind me, go

1593
01:53:51,791 --> 01:53:53,915
Yes, yes, don't let go of him.

1594
01:53:57,458 --> 01:53:58,665
You're useless.

1595
01:54:04,666 --> 01:54:06,165
Careful, Boss.

1596
01:54:07,333 --> 01:54:09,832
Faster, don't let him run away.

1597
01:54:15,958 --> 01:54:18,165
Faster. I can run faster with a broken leg.

1598
01:54:22,875 --> 01:54:24,540
- Go.
- Stop there.

1599
01:54:28,041 --> 01:54:29,249
Stop there.

1600
01:54:33,375 --> 01:54:35,040
Watch out.

1601
01:54:47,333 --> 01:54:48,832
Phoenix, don't let go. Help.

1602
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:50,499
Hang on.

1603
01:54:53,250 --> 01:54:54,540
Let me. . .

1604
01:55:15,833 --> 01:55:17,499
Don't let go.

1605
01:55:18,875 --> 01:55:20,415
Help pull me up.

1606
01:55:35,083 --> 01:55:36,957
Hurry.

1607
01:55:37,500 --> 01:55:38,874
Over there.

1608
01:55:39,416 --> 01:55:42,499
Boss, the cops are here.

1609
01:55:43,041 --> 01:55:44,374
Go, Boss.

1610
01:55:46,750 --> 01:55:48,332
Don't let go.

1611
01:55:50,333 --> 01:55:51,707
Kong went down.

1612
01:55:54,958 --> 01:55:56,457
Kong.

1613
01:56:18,958 --> 01:56:20,790
Lau Lin-kong, he's from the U. K.

1614
01:56:25,416 --> 01:56:26,624
We're the Tigers

1615
01:56:27,458 --> 01:56:28,457
of

1616
01:56:29,125 --> 01:56:30,165
Kowloon

1617
01:56:30,625 --> 01:56:31,790
City.

1618
01:56:35,125 --> 01:56:35,582
Buddy.

1619
01:56:35,750 --> 01:56:37,832
Just turn back.

1620
01:56:38,041 --> 01:56:40,332
Leave me alone.

1621
01:56:45,708 --> 01:56:47,165
Thanks, Bruce.

1622
01:57:00,666 --> 01:57:02,207
Run.

1623
01:57:13,083 --> 01:57:16,499
The Police busted the joint and
arrested the drug dealer.

1624
01:57:17,083 --> 01:57:19,082
Lau Lin-kong was rushed to the hospital.

1625
01:57:20,208 --> 01:57:22,707
He kept his distance after his recovery.

1626
01:57:23,708 --> 01:57:27,040
His death in the mid-60s was
allegedly drug related.

1627
01:57:27,958 --> 01:57:31,165
Bruce never got over losing him.

1628
01:58:22,750 --> 01:58:24,249
Down on your knees.

1629
01:58:29,208 --> 01:58:31,457
Kowtow to your ancestors.

1630
01:58:38,958 --> 01:58:41,374
You're in big trouble.

1631
01:58:42,833 --> 01:58:44,457
People are injured

1632
01:58:44,958 --> 01:58:46,790
and you destroyed their dope.

1633
01:58:47,541 --> 01:58:51,165
Two things will happen if you stay.

1634
01:58:53,208 --> 01:58:57,082
You either go to jail or get beaten to death.

1635
01:58:59,583 --> 01:59:01,582
That's why I'm sending you to the U.S.

1636
01:59:06,583 --> 01:59:11,249
I hope you'll keep your nose clean

1637
01:59:12,375 --> 01:59:14,582
and stay out of trouble.

1638
01:59:19,208 --> 01:59:20,874
When you come back,

1639
01:59:23,083 --> 01:59:26,165
the family can be reunited.

1640
02:01:33,291 --> 02:01:37,790
Mother, watch over Phoenix in the U.S.

1641
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:42,040
Pray he'll make a name for himself abroad.

1642
02:01:43,291 --> 02:01:44,624
When he comes back,

1643
02:01:44,791 --> 02:01:50,082
we'll be one happy family again.

1644
02:02:05,250 --> 02:02:06,332
3 days later,

1645
02:02:06,500 --> 02:02:09,665
we sent Bruce off
at the Kowloon Wharf pier.

1646
02:02:10,625 --> 02:02:13,749
I remember the ship was called
the SS President Wilson.

1647
02:02:26,875 --> 02:02:28,165
Mom.

1648
02:02:30,666 --> 02:02:33,499
According to Shunde customs,

1649
02:02:33,666 --> 02:02:35,874
the father cannot see his son off.

1650
02:02:37,500 --> 02:02:39,082
I understand.

1651
02:02:39,458 --> 02:02:40,874
You're on your own out there.

1652
02:02:41,041 --> 02:02:43,165
Be careful.

1653
02:02:43,416 --> 02:02:44,832
Don't worry about me.

1654
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:48,457
Settle down first.

1655
02:02:48,625 --> 02:02:50,415
I've applied for college.

1656
02:02:50,541 --> 02:02:52,999
You can pick me up then.

1657
02:02:53,166 --> 02:02:55,499
- Phoenix.
- Phoenix.

1658
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:01,582
Like I said, we're buddies.

1659
02:03:01,750 --> 02:03:02,832
You said it.

1660
02:03:07,416 --> 02:03:08,707
What's the matter?

1661
02:03:09,208 --> 02:03:10,415
Enter the Dragon into a foreign land.

1662
02:03:10,583 --> 02:03:12,332
OK, Dragon.

1663
02:03:13,416 --> 02:03:14,999
We'll make a film when you get back.

1664
02:03:15,166 --> 02:03:17,540
You'll be Wong Fei-hung, I'll be Shek Kin.

1665
02:03:22,250 --> 02:03:23,790
Phoenix.

1666
02:03:26,666 --> 02:03:28,290
When are you coming home?

1667
02:03:29,958 --> 02:03:30,999
Robert.

1668
02:03:31,791 --> 02:03:34,749
You'll be proud of me when I come home.

1669
02:03:38,666 --> 02:03:40,082
I have to go, Mom.

1670
02:04:22,458 --> 02:04:24,582
With $1 02 in his pocket,

1671
02:04:25,250 --> 02:04:28,707
Bruce left for a new life in the U.S.

1672
02:04:29,791 --> 02:04:34,582
All his brags came true in the end.
