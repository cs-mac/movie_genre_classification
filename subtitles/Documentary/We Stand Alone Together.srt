1
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,958
-okay.
-welcome.

2
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,109
Hi.

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,317
Thanks for sitting down with us.
We appreciate it.

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,992
Would you recount for me
the incident where you were wounded?

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,510
Well, I was standing...

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,117
...on the top of this hill
at the aid station...

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,114
...and a random shell came in.

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,909
It couldn't have gone off
more than 10 feet away...

9
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:42,678
... because all I remember
is a tremendous blast and a flash.

10
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,112
And the next thing I knew,
I was on the ground in the snow...

11
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,874
...and I tried to get up.

12
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,476
And when I tried to get up, l....

13
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,073
only thing I could see
were the broken ends of my legs.

14
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,880
And I thought my legs
were gone. I was--

15
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,669
Because that's all--
Both femurs were shattered.

16
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,398
They were laying down here as I was
on my back, trying to raise my legs up.

17
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,312
And I thought:

18
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:18,235
"I'm dead," you know,
"I'm about to die."

19
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,112
And I said--

20
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,638
I said my Act of Contrition,
because I am a Catholic.

21
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,469
And then the next thing
I thought of was my mother.

22
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,799
And I thought,
"What's she gonna say?"

23
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,474
Because I was an only child.

24
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,792
My name is C. Carwood Lipton.

25
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,992
I was born in Huntington, west Virginia.
Grew up in Huntington.

26
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,870
Frederick T. Heyliger. Concord,
Massachusetts was my hometown.

27
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,476
I was born in a town named
lnchelium, Washington.

28
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,234
It's on an lndian reservation.

29
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,513
My name's j.B. Stokes.
I was born close to Bonham, Texas...

30
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,796
...in an area called Leonard.

31
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,395
Born and raised in Columbus, Ohio...

32
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,473
...my dad worked for the railroad.
My mom was a housewife.

33
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,269
My nickname was Babe.
And my mother...

34
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,990
...she was a little lrish broad.
Red hair. Fiery.

35
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,629
Great woman.

36
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,269
Born and raised in Philadelphia,
where times were tough.

37
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,439
Mom had 10 children,
so you had to work to survive.

38
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,069
It was just survival
in the streets of Philadelphia.

39
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:15,270
We came up in the Depression. Sometimes
we'd live on a farm and have...

40
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,471
... pigs and raise a garden.

41
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,872
I saw people that really were hungry
and had hard times.

42
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:26,232
My father was able to find employment.
We never went hungry.

43
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:32,072
We lived on a farm. Everybody
was poor. That was the Depression.

44
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,875
When I got to about 10,
I got a paper route.

45
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,232
I made $5 a month. Something like that.
But it was something.

46
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:46,310
There's a work ethic the Pennsylvania
Dutch in this area are very proud of.

47
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,680
I was the oldest one, so I sort of
branched out on my own at an early age.

48
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,476
I was married when I was
19 years old in 1941.

49
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,712
on December 7 of '41...

50
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,872
...we were in a store,
and a guy, he says:

51
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,197
"The U.S.A. is in a war with japan."

52
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,671
And everything just went silent.

53
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,873
I said, "Let's go in the Army."
He said, "l don't want to."

54
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,595
I said, "You're gonna have
to go sooner or later."

55
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,594
Something was wrong with you
if you weren't in the service.

56
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,591
It was what you had to do.

57
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,197
I wasn't gonna be in the infantry.
I was gonna be in some...

58
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,029
...top kind of a unit,
or I wasn't gonna be in the Army.

59
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:41,277
LIFE magazine had run
an article on paratroopers...

60
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,276
...sometime in early 1942.

61
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,836
And it told about the
training that they got...

62
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,274
...and the difficult physical
requirements, and I got interested...

63
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,358
...in seeing if I could
become a paratrooper.

64
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,872
Nobody forced you to do this,
you volunteered.

65
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,476
And it was the notion...

66
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,993
...that you wanted to do something.
You wanted to be with the best.

67
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,273
But once you got in there,
you was proud to be.

68
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,196
we was proud of our boots,
and our shoulder patch.

69
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,397
And we was proud to be paratroopers.

70
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:28,760
And we was proud to be working with
the guys we were working with.

71
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,797
You know these people
that you're in service with....

72
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,749
You know those people better than
anybody in your life.

73
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,077
You know them right down
to the final thing.

74
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,308
And that comes when you start
your training, while that progresses.

75
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:00,270
-Each man was like a championship boxer.
-out of 100%, only 10% made it.

76
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,278
-I thought I'd die.
-No holding back.

77
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:08,554
-You had to hang in there and be tough.
-We marched 118 miles in three days.

78
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,832
The training I got
and the men I trained with...

79
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,719
...gave me the confidence
to go into battle.

80
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,035
We were just a bunch of ordinary kids
when we went in.

81
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,159
The training was to build you up
physically and mentally.

82
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,875
Some of them lost as much as 40 pounds.

83
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,119
But I didn't have nothing to lose.
I weighed about 130.

84
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,989
If I lost 40 pounds,
I'd have been too small to stay.

85
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,671
You know, they weeded out so many.

86
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,396
They'd be there one day,
and they'd be gone the next.

87
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,230
They couldn't keep up with it.
They couldn't take that hard training.

88
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,917
You had the cream
of the cream of the cream.

89
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,478
we had to climb this mountain called
Currahee every morning. Run up and back.

90
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,871
If you couldn't,
you'd end up in another unit.

91
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,709
The name Currahee means
"We stand alone together."

92
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:17,398
That's an lndian name.
It became a symbol of the camp...

93
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,110
...because it was rough and tough,
going up and down.

94
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:27,111
A lot of times, when some of the guys
would go and get them a drink or so...

95
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,273
...you'd see them laying on the road,
where they were sick.

96
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,598
It didn't matter how hard you trained
and how tired you got...

97
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,231
...you would still go out on your own
and run the mountain at night...

98
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,632
...which was ridiculous
because during the day...

99
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,109
...all you did was bitch and moan.

100
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,911
At night, they'd get a couple guys
and go up and do it on your own.

101
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,669
we learned how to be
soldiers at Toccoa...

102
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,509
...as a group, all of us coming in...

103
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,399
...from no experience
in the Army at all...

104
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,313
...coming in directly
from civilian life.

105
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,199
I'm gonna say this,
I believe...

106
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,991
...that the paratroopers
of the 101st Airborne Division...

107
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,758
...was as well-trained as you
could get a soldier to be at that time.

108
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,396
-We packed our own chutes.
-Nervous as hell.

109
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,831
You're asking yourself,
"What am I doing here?"

110
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,869
-Coming down is great.
-lt affects everybody different.

111
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,430
-I broke my foot.
-You're dropping 16 feet a second.

112
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,677
I can remember
just like it was yesterday.

113
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,876
That morning after breakfast...

114
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,073
...they marched us all
out there to the airfield.

115
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,317
There were guys
that already made their jump.

116
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,759
And they were all hollering,
"You're gonna be sorry!" You know?

117
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,679
You didn't want
to be afraid, you know...

118
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,795
...because these other guys are there
with you. Your bravado and all that....

119
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,113
You didn't wanna be afraid,
so you kept that out of your mind.

120
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,269
Jumping out of a plane wasn't like
today. My first flight up, I jumped.

121
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,358
That was years before
I landed an aircraft.

122
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,472
Most of the troopers
was the same story.

123
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,275
Foolishly, I didn't think
it'd be so tough, but....

124
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,553
The first time-- The first jump
you make is not all that bad.

125
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,309
You don't know what you're doing.
When you step out...

126
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,949
...the chute just opened right then.

127
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,828
As I went out the door, I was blank.

128
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,560
I cannot remember leaving the plane...

129
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,917
...until after the chute
opened up. My God.

130
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,674
But after that, it wasn't as bad.

131
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,634
It was a thrill.
It was like going on a roller coaster.

132
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,109
You get off
and want to get back on.

133
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,516
It was a thrill.

134
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,593
It was a high, as they say these days.

135
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,278
Everybody enJoyed themselves.
Landing was the hardest part.

136
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,876
once that chute opened,
I was happy as a lark.

137
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,594
You know, coming down is great.

138
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,670
I was small too, and I didn't
hurt myself when I hit the ground.

139
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,312
Some of the big ones hit
like a ton of-- what's his name?

140
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:22,399
You worried most about your chute.
Did you pack it right?

141
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:28,311
You'd pack it one day and jump the next
day. You thought about it all night.

142
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,278
You had...

143
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,677
...ideas of what you might
have done wrong, or....

144
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,836
But it worked out fine.

145
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,476
We made five jumps
in the third week there.

146
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:45,073
Then you were a qualified paratrooper.
Got your wings pinned on...

147
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,680
...and became one of the elite members
of the parachute regiment.

148
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,878
We were thoroughly prepared.

149
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,998
The men were...

150
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,471
...trained, hardened...

151
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,675
... physically and mentally.

152
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,071
And they were ready to jump.

153
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:14,319
That's how we started
off for Normandy.

154
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,671
When you walk up that gangplank,
you know you're gone.

155
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:38,396
As you pull out of harbor,
and you pass the Statue of Liberty....

156
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,596
"Will I ever be coming back?
I don't know."

157
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,994
You know you're in a parachute troop.

158
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,557
You're gonna be jumping behind
enemy lines. what do you expect?

159
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,875
You have no idea.

160
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,877
That'll make anybody stand...

161
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,470
...and search his soul
for a few minutes.

162
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,197
We were ready.

163
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:20,990
We were stationed in England
for about a year before D-Day.

164
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,359
we had a lot of maneuvers
and parachute jumping.

165
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,393
They put us in a camp...

166
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,392
... preparing us for D-Day.

167
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,069
At just about a week before D-Day...

168
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:38,269
...they put us in. No liberties, no
nothing. You couldn't get out of camp.

169
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,950
They had guards around
the marshaling area...

170
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,879
...so nobody could leave.

171
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,113
That's when you felt
that, "This is it."

172
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,874
We did not know which day.

173
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:55,596
we did not know where we were
gonna jump until we were locked in.

174
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,115
And then they had the briefing...

175
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,399
...to tell you exactly
what your mission was.

176
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,194
And they took this map...

177
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,830
...and they made a model
of the features of the land.

178
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,675
They put in all the buildings,
the bridges, the knolls...

179
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,913
...all the sand dunes.
Everything was in on that layout.

180
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,430
We knew it by heart.
We knew where we were going.

181
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,517
We knew exactly what to do.

182
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,395
I mean, if you could've been there
at the time to see...

183
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:31,589
...where the planes were lined up and
all the gliders hooked up to the planes.

184
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,588
T anks and trucks
and fields and fields of them.

185
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:40,072
I had no idea that there was
that much hardware.

186
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,113
No question, we knew
it was gonna be big.

187
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,117
And that day...

188
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,480
...that we got the orders
to get on the planes.... This is it.

189
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,112
We had confidence in our leaders...

190
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:13,673
...and all the plans and preparations
that took place before the invasion.

191
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,351
We were confident and calm.

192
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,516
we were all loaded down. we carried
everything we thought we could...

193
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,479
...in the line of personal items...

194
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,912
... plus the necessary things
we were assigned to carry.

195
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,957
And we were loaded.

196
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,274
Everybody got in there...

197
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,916
...and a lot of them were
very scared. I was scared too...

198
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:23,073
... but probably in a different way
that other people were.

199
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,919
As long as I was in that plane...

200
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,277
...and they were gonna
get me there safely...

201
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,671
...that's all that I worried about.

202
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,952
At the time,
I had no feeling whatsoever.

203
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,272
My feeling was for my brother,
who was killed.

204
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,068
That infuriated me.

205
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:03,070
And that's why, when I jumped
on D-Day, I swore....

206
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,909
I swore I would kill every damn
German I came across.

207
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,591
That's why they nicknamed me
Wild Bill. I killed a lot on D-Day.

208
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,077
The sky was clear,
coming across the channel.

209
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:23,673
Since I was jump master, I could lie
at the plane door with my head out...

210
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,275
...in the slipstream, looking down.

211
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,711
And I saw the thousands
of craft ships...

212
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,718
...everything from LCls
to battleships...

213
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,795
...down there in the channel.
I think that's when I first realized...

214
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:43,273
... how large the invasion was.
T remendously large, the invasion was.

215
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:48,998
We were out for 1 1 /2 hours before we--
We went down the south end of England...

216
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,471
...and then across
the jersey islands...

217
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,116
...and then across
the Cherbourg peninsula.

218
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,999
And that's when
the fireworks started.

219
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,917
Flak was terrible.

220
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,873
Anti-aircraft was absolutely horrendous.

221
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,308
It was like...

222
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,637
...a july the 4th celebration,
10 times over.

223
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,389
Then it would hit
under the wings and body...

224
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:20,634
...and you could hear it go...Iike
gravel hitting a car fender.

225
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,910
You could see
tracers all over.

226
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,157
Everybody wanted
to get out of the plane fast.

227
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,108
Whether it was high, low,
no matter where we were. Out!

228
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,550
They were getting shot up.

229
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,116
Finally, the pilots--
I happened to read their minds--

230
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,669
" Okay, we got so much gas...

231
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:43,630
...and we're gonna have
to get back to England.

232
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,593
What do we do with all
the guys back here?

233
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,109
Give them the green light. Get out."

234
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,793
We're ready to jump.

235
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,279
There was a relief when the green
light came on, and we said, "Let's go."

236
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,710
Well, I jumped up on a run...

237
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,670
...and hit the static line
with the hook and out the door...

238
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,750
...and got such an opening shock...

239
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,799
...from the prop blast,
that it broke this chin strap...

240
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,600
...that we had on this helmet liner.

241
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:20,198
And that's when I lost this famous
leg bag that everybody talks about...

242
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:26,191
...just from the shock of the opening.
It just flew right off my foot.

243
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,073
The British call them leg bags.

244
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,871
They gotta be this big, and you
stuff everything you can into them.

245
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:39,279
They're supposed to weigh 1 5 pounds.
By the time you're done, they're 60.

246
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,075
Everyone that jumped
with a leg bag, they lost it.

247
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:47,313
Most of the paratroopers
that landed didn't have nothing.

248
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,078
I was one of them.

249
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,912
It tore right off...

250
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,832
... because we jumped at speeds
of 1 50 miles an hour...

251
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,195
... maybe even higher. I don't know.

252
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,868
And lower than we should've been.

253
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:05,312
That wasn't bad either,
because you got to the ground quicker.

254
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,832
When we went out the door, I looked
to see if my chute was open...

255
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,197
...and I saw tracer bullets
burning holes in the chute.

256
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:18,713
And they told us all you'll have to do
is shuffle up to the door...

257
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,556
...throw that leg out, prop blast
will hit it, and you're gone.

258
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,710
Well, they were right.

259
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,589
only I was going out,
and my leg was in...

260
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,877
...and I was hanging upside down...

261
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,874
...Iooking at everything down
with my leg in the plane.

262
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,868
All this happened in a split second.
Paul rolled me out.

263
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,877
Paul Rogers rolled me out.

264
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:49,677
I just helped him out. I just picked
him up and threw him out, I guess.

265
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,997
I had to get out.
We wanted to get out so bad.

266
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,476
And I come down
right behind city hall...

267
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:01,071
...watched them shoot at me all the way,
which wasn't very long.

268
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:07,031
I could see the tracers. They were
kind of spraying around in the air.

269
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,878
Whoever the machine gunner was down
there that was concentrating on me...

270
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,554
...apparently was
not a very good shot.

271
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,479
They were firing in every direction.

272
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:22,036
You don't know which way to go.

273
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,756
The next thing is that you are
getting close to landing...

274
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,192
...and you're saying, "There's
some trees. There's a road.

275
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:37,390
Try and slip to avoid the trees. Try
and slip to avoid landing on the road."

276
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,991
I slipped and my chute fell across
power lines, and I hit a fence...

277
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,476
...and fell into a farmer's garden.

278
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,474
I'll never forget that fence.
It had glass on top of it...

279
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:53,275
...and cut me up,
but that didn't bother me.

280
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,308
I just-- I was down,
and I got down with my gun.

281
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,990
I hit the ground in a field, and we
were way-- I got looking at my map...

282
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,711
...and we weren't close to where
we were supposed to be.

283
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,396
We was plumb off our maps
that they'd given us.

284
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,519
So we had to make our way back.
we knew that the beach...

285
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:21,278
...was to the east. We headed that way
to find out where the outfit was.

286
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,675
My friend from Erie
was in another plane.

287
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:32,000
when I hit the ground, I hit about
2 feet away from him.

288
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,075
And him and I start walking around
looking for more of our troops.

289
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:42,269
And we were running into Germans
everywhere, but we had to hide.

290
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:47,674
You know, because if we didn't,
we were dead meat.

291
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,472
And I laid in a tree.
I had my trench knife.

292
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,877
And I reached up...

293
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:00,875
...and grabbed hold-- It was a big
trunk, the tree, and I swung into it.

294
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,989
I cut those risers with,
I think, one swipe.

295
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,993
And I come down that
tree like a monkey.

296
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,988
And then there I was
with a trench knife and a canteen...

297
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,875
...and about six candy bars
in my pocket...

298
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:21,232
... ready to fight
the German army, you know.

299
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,278
So there's four guys
that were with me on D-Day...

300
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,678
...who didn't have nothing
but a jump knife when they landed.

301
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,078
So we had to hope, scrounge.

302
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,310
As it worked out for all of us...

303
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:42,354
...Iater on, we'd run across somebody
who had been killed...

304
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,516
...and you'd take his weapon.

305
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:48,719
And that's how you get
a weapon for D-Day.

306
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,313
Rather haphazard.

307
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,677
we were scattered
all over the peninsula...

308
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:57,469
...so it was quite
a confused situation...

309
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,229
... but we were better prepared
than the Germans were.

310
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,000
The Germans didn't know
where we were.

311
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,909
Whereas on the beach,
those people coming in on boats...

312
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,948
...those Germans had guns
aimed at them, waiting on them.

313
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:16,153
They had it tough.
I admire every one of them.

314
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,954
These guns were pointed
and firing right down on the beach.

315
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:36,269
People on the landing craft were coming
onto the beach and were being fired at.

316
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:53,070
This battery of 105s was placed
precisely where it should be...

317
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:57,353
...to protect any troops
coming up that causeway.

318
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,792
As you sit back years later,
you think:

319
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,828
"This was laid out
exactly right, tactically."

320
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,232
we thought we knew
every foxhole in Normandy.

321
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,716
We knew where everything was.
We knew it cold.

322
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,999
But on this one, the Germans
had moved in there...

323
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:33,075
...and camouflaged it so well,
we didn't know it was there.

324
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,870
E Company was the assault company
of the battalion.

325
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:54,194
we were trained from special assaults
and whatnot, special assignments.

326
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:59,878
They weren't aware of what we had. They
didn't realize we only had 1 2 people.

327
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,396
We worked our way down
through the farm area...

328
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,355
...to a hedgerow. Lt. Winters
had us set up a firing position.

329
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,514
And I went up
to scout it for myself...

330
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,593
...crawled out along this hedgerow...

331
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:21,551
...to get a little closer, to look it
over, and I felt I could see a trench.

332
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,191
And I thought I knew
where our machine gun was.

333
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,793
Winters...

334
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,878
...was an exceptional leader.

335
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:34,477
And he was able to size up,
all through the war...

336
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:39,310
...size up combat situations
and decide quickly...

337
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:44,634
...and correctly the best way to take
care of whatever the problem was.

338
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:49,470
I divided the group into two units.
Lt. Compton was with me.

339
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,439
I gave him half the men,
and I took half.

340
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:58,713
I gave instructions, "I want
Compton, Malarkey...

341
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:03,869
...and wynn to crawl up there
and hand-grenade that machine gun.

342
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:09,513
Crawl through the grass,
and as you throw your grenades...

343
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,558
... I'll charge up
with the rest of the guys."

344
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,109
I had the two machine guns set up...

345
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:19,068
...to give him covering fire
while he crawled up there.

346
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,475
I get out to this hedgerow...

347
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:25,878
...and I peek-- I look out,
and I peek through the bushes...

348
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:31,598
...and I see a couple of Germans
over there, about 30, 50 yards away...

349
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,673
...stoking this gun and firing it.

350
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,960
I pull out a grenade
and pull the pin...

351
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,716
...and I threw it as high
and as far as I could throw it...

352
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,873
...in their general direction.
It had enough hang time on it...

353
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:52,158
...that by the time it got to them,
it went off in the air.

354
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,432
I jumped up with other guys,
and we charged...

355
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:00,350
...so that we all jumped into
the first position together.

356
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:05,071
They had trenches cut in where
they worked, the Germans did.

357
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,589
They jumped down
in them trenches...

358
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,355
...and they worked them Germans
like a ghost assault.

359
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:16,270
Three Germans broke off
from this position...

360
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,476
...to run across the field,
which was the wrong thing to do...

361
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,153
...from their viewpoint.

362
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,038
We cut them down.

363
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:30,991
I was in a trench, and I looked,
and I saw an arm.

364
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,789
I didn't even see-- The man
was in a camouflage tent...

365
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:39,352
...and I didn't see him. Then I saw
an arm stuck out of that tent...

366
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,279
...and one of those
potato-masher grenades...

367
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,876
...you know, with a stick
come out of there.

368
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,917
I said,
"He's gonna miss me."

369
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,197
It fell right down
in that trench with me.

370
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,513
I was trying to scuttle my way
out of the way, and it went off...

371
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:00,550
...and I felt like it blew my butt
over my head, and it pretty near did.

372
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:04,913
He's behind the enemy lines on D-Day.

373
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,475
Does he holler, "Help"?

374
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,874
No.

375
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:14,757
He hollers, "l'm sorry, lieutenant.
I'm sorry. I goofed."

376
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:20,872
I felt like I kind of let him down,
but that's neither here nor there.

377
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,469
My God.

378
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:32,476
It's beautiful when you
think of a guy who's...

379
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:38,074
...so dedicated to his company,
to his buddies...

380
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:43,599
...that he apologizes for getting hit,
but that's the kind of guy he was.

381
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,992
That's the kind each one of them was.
They were all the same.

382
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,799
I look upon them,
each man, with great respect.

383
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,156
Respect I can't describe.

384
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,320
Each one of them proved himself...

385
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,073
Each one of them proved himself...

386
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,116
...that he...

387
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,510
...could do the job.

388
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,718
We've been through Normandy, through
battle. Maybe if I had been harder...

389
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:27,034
...if I had done a little bit better job,
more men would've gone home.

390
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,191
I never thought
I'd get through D-Day...

391
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:49,594
...Iet alone the next phase. I thought
I was gonna get killed instantly.

392
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,954
The chances of survival is very slim.

393
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,115
There's the parachute.

394
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,911
I got that done
in Edinburgh, Scotland, 1944.

395
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,469
Me and johnny Martin.

396
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,238
Drunk as a skunk.

397
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:16,795
Guarnere and I decided
we'd go to Scotland and get a tattoo.

398
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:20,874
We didn't figure
we had a chance to come home.

399
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,472
But....

400
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,472
Yep.

401
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,278
We thought, "Well, hell...

402
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,873
...the war is just starting, and Christ,
we're 50% gone now.

403
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,275
So it's a long haul."

404
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,911
The 101st came back from Normandy
after about 33 days...

405
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,629
...and we were replacements
for those who were killed...

406
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,995
...or wounded in Normandy.

407
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,111
There were young kids that came in...

408
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,477
...and for some reason,
I don't know why...

409
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,590
...they were the first ones killed.

410
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,798
And I think maybe
they were trying...

411
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:13,672
...to impress the older guys,
maybe people like me or Shifty.

412
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:18,431
We were in awe of them. They had
infantry badges on their uniform.

413
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,872
They had a star on their
Jump wings. They....

414
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:27,390
They were our heroes.
That's how we looked at them.

415
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,271
I don't know why, but I got
right there to where...

416
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,951
...I didn't want to be friendly
with replacements coming in...

417
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:40,073
...because, God, I didn't like
seeing them get killed.

418
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,392
It just tore me up, and....

419
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:48,069
I don't know why, but they
were the first ones killed.

420
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,949
My 10-man squad that I was in,
eight were replacements.

421
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:55,396
The squad leader and
the assistant squad leader...

422
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:59,872
...Sgt. Muck and Cpl. Penkala
had been to Normandy. we hadn't.

423
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,749
The eight of us hadn't
been anywhere but Aldbourne.

424
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:08,112
The training got really tough
between there and the Holland jump.

425
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,271
Training, training, training.

426
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,352
We had missions scratched.
We were to jump on...

427
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,397
...a French city of T ouraine.

428
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,795
And it got to the sand-table part...

429
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,475
...where we gathered round
to see who was gonna do what...

430
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:26,470
...and Patton's troops overran
the drop zone, so that was called off.

431
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:32,676
we were wondering if we'd ever get to
go, and then it got to be September.

432
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:45,117
It was a Sunday afternoon,
noontime, 70 degrees.

433
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,271
The drop was perfect.

434
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,751
Everybody was dropping
on the same field.

435
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,670
Daytime drops are a lot easier.
You can prepare for the landing.

436
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,674
I saw a plowed field,
and I slipped right over it.

437
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:05,153
I believe I almost landed standing up,
you know, soft. A great jump.

438
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,148
The most dangerous part about it
was that people were...

439
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:14,480
...Iosing helmets and equipment, and
all this equipment's raining down...

440
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:17,950
...and if you got hit with this,
you're gonna be killed...

441
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,759
...or wounded before you
got off the drop zone.

442
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:25,118
Everybody got together.
We all assembled very fast.

443
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,875
We moved out towards
the Wilhelmina Canal.

444
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:34,478
our mission was, first, to take
a bridge over the wilhelmina Canal.

445
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,478
It took us hours to get there.

446
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:41,269
And taking hours to get there,
the few German troops...

447
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,877
...that were securing this bridge
had plenty of time...

448
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,913
...to set their charges
to blow the thing up.

449
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:53,352
And just as we got to it,
I was maybe 1 50 yards away...

450
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,715
...it blew up in our faces.

451
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,357
Rocks and timbers were flying
and falling all around you...

452
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:10,311
...and you can't help but think,
"My God, what a way to die in combat...

453
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,758
...to be killed with a flying timber."

454
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,278
We were that close.

455
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:21,951
It delayed us until morning.
We wanted to get across that night...

456
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,392
... but it took us till
the next morning to get across.

457
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,758
But once we got in, the Dutch--

458
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,479
It was just marvelous, their reaction.

459
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,996
They loved Americans, and still do...

460
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:43,473
...for coming in there
and pushing the Germans out.

461
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,190
They called us "angels
from the sky, " which we were.

462
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,275
I mean, you're under German
occupation for four years, right?

463
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,950
It's horrible, and you see
paratroopers come out of the sky.

464
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,914
Who were they? They were the angels.
They loved you.

465
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,594
Their welcome was unbelievable.

466
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:15,472
They couldn't restrain
how happy they were to see you.

467
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,319
It was hard to get
down the streets...

468
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,080
... because the people
were swarming over us...

469
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,874
...trying to congratulate us
for being there.

470
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:27,629
They hugged you and kissed you,
and we didn't mind.

471
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,718
Naturally, we was young,
We didn't mind at all.

472
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:34,470
And they were really proud
to see us in there...

473
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,395
...to the point where it
was dangerous for us...

474
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,394
...trying to clean out the town
because snipers did damage...

475
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,630
...in a situation like that.

476
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:01,517
We had a lot of fighting
because we're on the Rhine River...

477
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,830
...and Germany is across the river.

478
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,669
They're fighting like heck
to keep us out of Germany.

479
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:13,671
It's called "The lsland." We called it
The lsland, and we set up...

480
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,355
...positions there.

481
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:20,069
We had some substantial battles there.

482
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:24,513
They could observe any movement
we made during the daytime...

483
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,871
...and at their will...

484
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:32,795
...they could just shell us. Mortar--
Put mortar fire on us...

485
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,629
...when they had
a target of opportunity.

486
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,070
I heard something coming down.

487
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,316
I knew what it was...

488
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:46,350
...a mortar shell, and I threw
my arm up, like that...and went down.

489
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,988
It lit within 3 feet of me, 4.

490
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:54,189
But when it blows,
it goes up like that:

491
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:59,560
It went through my arm and hit me in
the head. I was bleeding pretty good.

492
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,718
Well, I was picked to go up on a dike.

493
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:08,512
So, of course, when you get
to the top, you don't expose yourself.

494
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,712
I took my rifle
and put my helmet on it...

495
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:17,956
...and put it over, even with
the road, on a dike.

496
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:21,795
No action, so I brought it back down,
put the helmet on...

497
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,791
...and I sort of peeked over.

498
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,552
when I peeked over, I saw a hand with
a potato masher, and he threw it at me.

499
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,473
I ducked. It hit my helmet
and bounced off.

500
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:37,509
When that thing bounced off my helmet,
I hollered to the guys below:

501
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,874
" Live grenade."

502
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,674
If Lesniewski hadn't
hollered, "Grenade"...

503
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:45,389
...and I had enough sense to know
that that's that grenade...

504
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:51,157
...that hit my rifle and is right
in front of my face, practically...

505
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,834
... I'd have either
had my head blown off...

506
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:58,670
...or I'd have definitely been blinded.
There's no question about that...

507
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,957
... because I just got turned,
just part way...

508
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:06,716
...and it exploded, and it
caught me in the face, neck...

509
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,918
...Ieft arm, under the arm,
in the shoulder.

510
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:14,159
I hollered for them to take off.
I said, "Get the hell back."

511
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,313
I had eight grenades,
so I had taken them off...

512
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,914
... pulled the pins
and threw them over.

513
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:27,508
And while the grenades were rolling
down or landing wherever they were...

514
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,319
...they were hitting
some of the rauts...

515
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,393
... because I could hear
screaming, crying.

516
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:37,553
I think I threw eight grenades
in about four seconds.

517
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,035
And then I took off running.

518
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,909
So the doctor that counted
the holes in me down at Nijmegen....

519
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,593
Yeah, NiJmegen.

520
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,594
The first doctor that
really counted the holes...

521
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,955
...said there was 32.

522
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:57,717
That was our first experience
with artillery in large numbers.

523
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:03,830
I can remember sitting there a couple
of nights listening to artillery land.

524
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:11,478
And the 88 was the fiercest
cannon that the Germans had.

525
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,712
It was the way they used it,
an all-purpose gun.

526
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,873
It could shoot anti-aircraft tanks,
anti-personnel, airburst.

527
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,793
That was the bad ones,
when shells went up.

528
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:28,918
I saw a huge mushroom cloud...

529
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,918
...from the shell...

530
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,790
...and joe T oye stepped out of it.

531
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,316
I run up. I remember that
like it was yesterday.

532
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:45,156
I run up, and I grabbed him.
He said, "Don't touch me."

533
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:50,952
I said, "What's the matter?" He said,
" l'm hit all over." He said, " l'm bad."

534
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:54,157
I said, " Okay."
I said, " l'm gonna go see jim."

535
00:40:54,320 --> 00:41:00,793
He said, as bad as he was hurting,
Joe T oye, he said:

536
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:06,952
" Heffron, I already
checked him. He's gone."

537
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:18,479
Jim Campbell might be alive today
if he hadn't said to me:

538
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:23,236
"Heffron, you stay here with your gun.

539
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,710
I'm going up."

540
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:34,710
And I never, never, never--
I sleep on it, I eat on it--

541
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,716
I never, never forgot that.

542
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,038
And anybody that went through it...

543
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:49,433
...will tell you the same thing.
They can't--

544
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,757
It's just...

545
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:59,398
...so bad all your life, you gotta
remember what one guy did...

546
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:05,430
...because he thought it was his
Job to do, and he took a shot for you.

547
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,950
The exhaustion on these men,
the physical exhaustion...

548
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:25,194
...affects their endurance
to be able to cope.

549
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:29,235
You don't realize it at the time
you come off the line...

550
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:34,679
...from living in the mud
and being absolutely miserable...

551
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,877
...for 70 days straight.

552
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:41,516
You didn't realize
that you'd only be off the line...

553
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,912
...for a few days, and you're
gonna be facing Bastogne.

554
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:57,671
This is the last desperate
action of the Germans...

555
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:01,310
...to turn the tide of this whole war.

556
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,877
What it is, it is Bastogne. It is--

557
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:53,989
-This is Bo jack's woods, right?
-lt is the woods.

558
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:57,118
Sure looks different now.
There ain't no snow.

559
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,069
These trees might've been replanted.

560
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:06,519
I think if the trees look
like they did in '44 or '45...

561
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:09,274
...we could get a better idea.

562
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,952
-That's it.
-Yeah.

563
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,798
That's the town of Foy.

564
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:20,758
oh, this is definitely the area.
This is definitely.

565
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:27,436
There's the town of Foy, after the empty
field, where those cattle are grazing.

566
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,079
About half a mile away.

567
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:33,756
Yeah, we had an outpost set up
looking right into the town of Foy.

568
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,596
They had to watch everything
because we'd come in here and sleep.

569
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:43,550
we had our foxholes right over here,
and the other area and the other.

570
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:47,474
wherever we had to move out
and dig in again...

571
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:50,279
... because the Krauts had artillery.

572
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:53,591
Most intense I ever
went through here, shelling.

573
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,197
Most intense in the world. Couldn't
believe it. You had to be here.

574
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:01,750
You just dove in the hole
and prayed, and that's it.

575
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,480
If it comes in,
you ain't gonna know it.

576
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:09,350
we lost Muck and Penkala over on this
side. They were killed instantly.

577
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:13,274
The shell went down,
direct hit right in the hole.

578
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,910
-Made mush out of them.
-Luz come over and hollered:

579
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:20,231
"l can't see nothing of them,
nothing there."

580
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,153
They were all gone,
just disintegrated.

581
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,629
Unmerciful shelling, really.

582
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:32,274
Everything out here was shredded.
Yeah, shredded by it.

583
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,633
I tell you, it's an odd feeling.

584
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:46,390
T o me, it brings a lot of memories,
memories of the men, the times...

585
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,518
...good and bad, a lot of memories.

586
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:03,711
It was the most miserable place
I've ever been in my life, even today.

587
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,038
on a real cold night,
we go to bed...

588
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:12,228
...and my wife will tell you,
I'll say, " l'm glad I'm not in Bastogne."

589
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:16,353
The Germans wanted Bastogne
because of the road network.

590
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:19,193
That's why it was such an obJective.

591
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:23,114
So that's where we had
to hold, which we did.

592
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:33,959
31 8 trucks come in around
noontime, and by that evening...

593
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:37,635
...everybody was loaded
and moving out.

594
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,950
We were short of equipment.

595
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:44,352
we didn't have enough ammunition
or enough warm clothes.

596
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:48,672
But we had confidence that our...

597
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:53,630
...higher military authorities would get
to us whatever we needed.

598
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:57,759
When we got up there, we didn't know
what we were getting into.

599
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,115
There was very little information...

600
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,669
...only that the Germans had
broken through.

601
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:07,709
We went down, loaded on the trucks.
Another truck came by with weapons...

602
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:12,954
...and pitched weapons. You catch one,
that's what you got until Bastogne.

603
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:16,590
As it worked out,
there was some men who actually...

604
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:21,390
...got on the trucks and left
for Bastogne that didn't have a rifle.

605
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:30,592
when we got there, we saw men
singly and in twos and threes...

606
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:34,514
...working their way back,
some of them without weapons...

607
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,352
...without equipment.

608
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,351
Some of them were terrified.

609
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,429
They were beat to a nub.
Every one of them were saying:

610
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:45,592
"They're gonna kill everybody."

611
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:50,959
They couldn't believe, when they
saw us up there, that we intended...

612
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:54,078
...to set up lines
and stop the Germans.

613
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,117
They said they couldn't be stopped.

614
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:00,353
We went in and started taking up
their weapons and ammunition.

615
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:05,674
Asking the retreating guys, "You got
any extra ammunition or grenades?"

616
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:09,958
You could hear the firing going
on up ahead, and we're marching...

617
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,151
...to it with little ammunition.

618
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:17,599
We marched through the night, went
to the front of Bastogne and dug in.

619
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,398
And then it snowed.

620
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:24,390
Snow, cold up to your rump.

621
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:27,711
We didn't have
no winter clothing or nothing.

622
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:31,236
A third of the doggone
casualties was either...

623
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:35,313
...frostbite or trench foot,
whatever you want to call it.

624
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:39,917
Bad move. A lot of snow...

625
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:43,311
...a lot of everything
you didn't like.

626
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,395
It was a cold place.

627
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:50,559
At this particular time,
we was on top of kind of a hill...

628
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,076
...and the top of the hill
had pine trees.

629
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,835
We set up our positions around
the fringe of the woods.

630
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,709
In Belgium, trees are planted.
They don't grow like in Maine.

631
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,677
There are rows of trees.

632
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:06,513
You look down a row
and can see half a mile.

633
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:10,229
on top of this hill,
there was a ridge with a tree line.

634
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,038
We were dug in there.

635
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:17,752
The Germans knew right where we were,
and they really gave us a shellacking.

636
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:24,992
T o an infantryman...

637
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:30,192
...in wartime, the mother earth
is your best friend.

638
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,069
You could always dig a hole and get
out of sight, you know.

639
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:40,437
We dug plenty of those.

640
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,868
You get through
hard ground quickly...

641
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,237
...when someone's shooting,
and shells are falling.

642
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:54,273
You can make fast work of it.
We just have to dig that hole.

643
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:57,830
we say we became experts
on foreign European soil.

644
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,709
we dug in, and two people
could dig better than one.

645
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:06,590
In ground that's frozen, it takes
a while. You just chip it out.

646
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:10,753
By the time you finish, they
whistle to you, "We're moving out."

647
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,753
And you go someplace else
and dig another one.

648
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,388
You must understand,
the Germans were--

649
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:21,270
We were surrounded. The Germans
were maybe 100 yards away from us.

650
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:26,833
No matter where you looked in a circle,
you could see artillery flashes.

651
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,879
So we knew from that
that we were surrounded.

652
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:34,953
But we went through a couple
of shellings at Bastogne...

653
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:39,272
...that were earthshaking.

654
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:44,036
If you lived through them, you remember
them for the rest of your life.

655
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:47,795
I'm not sure you're the same
for the rest of your life...

656
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:51,509
...after you live through them.
You never forget them.

657
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:55,468
There was one moment
I remember. I'll never forget it.

658
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:58,438
one guy got hit in the arm
with shrapnel...

659
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:01,239
...took his arm off above the elbow.

660
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:05,393
They were taking him out, he said,
"Get my watch off my arm."

661
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:07,312
Before they took him out.

662
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:10,517
That always stayed with me.

663
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:15,435
I mean, calm voice and everything,
"Get my watch off my arm."

664
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:22,797
on the 3rd of january, we withdrew
back to our former positions...

665
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:28,751
...there, up the hill from Foy.
And when we got there...

666
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:34,278
...we could see that the Germans
had zeroed in artillery there.

667
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:38,831
T rees were knocked down.
There were holes in the ground.

668
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,992
It was right at dusk, and
the Germans had this....

669
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:46,119
This woods of ours
zeroed in completely.

670
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:50,398
And as we hit the woods,
this tremendous artillery attack came.

671
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,315
They knew where we were...

672
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:03,553
...and started shooting,
point-blank, 88s into our area.

673
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:07,309
They let us have it.
Everything, the kitchen sink...

674
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:11,393
... mortars, a rocket thing
with a screaming sound.

675
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:18,672
It scared the hell-- I was scared,
but I think I was petrified then.

676
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:22,276
I thought the whole world
was shooting at us at once.

677
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:27,713
I jumped into a foxhole somebody
had started and hadn't finished.

678
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:33,352
So I was crouched down in that foxhole,
but it wouldn't hold all of me.

679
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,273
From about my nose up
was above the ground.

680
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:39,398
I could see all these shells hitting.

681
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,996
Sgt. Guarnere
and joe T oye each lost a leg...

682
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:51,948
...in the same place, right there
on one hill. I remember.

683
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,951
just this certain instance.

684
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:59,917
Joe got caught not near his hole,
and Bill and I were ahead of him...

685
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:02,674
...and Bill had not been hit.

686
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:07,038
He came up out of his hole quickly.
We were still under heavy fire.

687
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,556
Joe said, "Jesus Christ...

688
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:14,156
...what do I have to do to die?"

689
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,959
He got hit real bad
in the back of his leg.

690
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:20,795
He's out hollering, "Medic,"
and he can't find a medic.

691
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:25,078
I went out to see what
I could do for him... I got it too.

692
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:31,914
I went over to Guarnere.
He was sitting on the ground.

693
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:35,516
His leg was badly mangled.

694
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:39,878
He was holding his leg,
and it was jerking like that:

695
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:50,033
He said, "Lip, they got
old Guarnere this time."

696
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:54,716
He had been hit before,
but they really got him there.

697
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:01,751
We got him out of there,
Babe Heffron and I and some others.

698
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:07,950
And they brought a jeep down,
and we put him on stretchers.

699
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:14,514
I better not talk about him.

700
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,989
I better not talk about him.

701
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,310
It was terrible.

702
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:29,115
We had lost some
very good men there.

703
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,716
T oye and Guarnere
had lost their legs there.

704
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:38,750
A number of other people were killed.
It was a difficult situation there.

705
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:43,118
When a man was wounded,
we felt glad for them...

706
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,077
...we felt happy for them.

707
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:51,634
He had a ticket to get out of there,
and maybe a ticket to go home.

708
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:55,076
And when we had a man
who was killed...

709
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:59,756
...we found that he was at peace.

710
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,832
And he looked so peaceful.

711
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:07,998
And we were glad that he found peace.

712
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,430
We had this...

713
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:18,990
...assistant squad leader,
name of Mellet.

714
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:22,072
He was from New York City.

715
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,959
And I overheard him
talking one time...

716
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:29,113
...this was in Bastogne,
he says:

717
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:32,431
" I been through...

718
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:35,717
... Normandy and went
through Holland...

719
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:38,838
...and to this day, I haven't
got one scratch."

720
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:44,552
He says, " l'm afraid when I do get it,
l'm really gonna get it."

721
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,472
And he was right.

722
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:51,350
In this little town of Foy,
he got killed.

723
00:55:55,720 --> 00:56:00,999
I don't think he had any premonition
of it. He just wondered about it.

724
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:03,230
But I never did wonder.

725
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:09,111
Never give it much thought.
You just live from day to day.

726
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:16,070
Keep your fingers crossed,
and that was it.

727
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:40,033
I have the honor to present the supreme
commander, Gen, Eisenhower,

728
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:48,793
It is a great personal honor
for me to be here today,

729
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:54,830
To take part in a ceremony
that is unique in American history,

730
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,879
Never before has a full division,,,

731
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,600
,,,been cited by the War Department,,,

732
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:05,548
,,,in the name of the president
for gallantry in action,

733
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:09,838
This day marks the beginning
of a new tradition,,,

734
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,594
,,,in the American Army,

735
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:16,799
With that tradition will always
be associated the name,,,

736
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:21,988
,,, of the 101st Airborne Division
and of Bastogne,

737
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:25,596
Good luck and God be with each of you,

738
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:39,434
The Germans had started to surrender.
They still had their arms...

739
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:44,913
... but as you're going
down the autobahn...

740
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:51,428
...there was almost a solid line
of German troops coming north.

741
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:57,312
And our job is to get to the end
and get to the heart of it.

742
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:04,915
Berchtesgaden,
that's the end of the line.

743
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:09,358
It's the retreat that Hitler
had for himself.

744
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:12,751
And he built his Eagle's Nest...

745
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:17,152
... his penthouse on top of the Alp...

746
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:22,440
...to, l'm sure, relax
and confer with his staff...

747
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:25,876
... because they all followed
him to Berchtesgaden.

748
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:29,237
This was their final retreat.

749
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,876
of course, this is where
they had their loot as well.

750
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:37,511
This was the goal of the French,
who were on our right flank.

751
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:42,196
This was the goal of the British.

752
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:47,229
And this is the place to capture.
This is the one everybody wanted.

753
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,630
Hitler's Berchtesgaden retreat...

754
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,872
,,,burned by SS troops
in the war's last days,

755
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:57,397
The chalet from which he hoped
to rule the world now lies in ruins,

756
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:00,791
American Air Force 's pictures
show the gutted rooms,,,

757
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:05,750
,,,and the great window through which
the fuhrer gazed out on the Alps,

758
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:11,638
We took Berchtesgaden May the 5th,
no fighting, no shooting.

759
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:14,917
The only thing I seen
of Berchtesgaden was a couple...

760
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:19,358
...dead SS troopers laying
on the road as we were going up.

761
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:24,958
It was beautiful country. He knew how
to pick out a good spot for a house.

762
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:30,240
We took over his house...

763
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,630
...and liberated it, you might say.

764
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:37,755
There was, obviously,
loot of all kinds...

765
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:43,040
...that the men were looking for,
such as guns....

766
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,317
There was money
that they were looting.

767
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:49,836
I was a pack rat anyway.
I picked up a lot of German items...

768
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,391
...including some post cards
and envelopes addressed to Hitler.

769
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:57,996
Come to find out, that place
was full of big art...

770
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:02,676
... Rembrandt and all those people
hanging on the wall.

771
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:06,833
old soldiers like us, we don't recognize
a painting when we see it.

772
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:11,790
The 101st Airborne Division uncovers
Hermann Goering 's art collection...

773
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:14,599
,,,hidden in a subterranean chamber,

774
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:18,389
Twelve hundred artworks
worth millions are included,

775
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:23,509
The treasures will go back to rightful
owners in pillaged nations,

776
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:31,950
we found a warehouse full of gin
and vodka and stuff like that.

777
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:35,237
Wasn't much whiskey.
Those people don't like it.

778
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:38,073
And we took it all and set up a bar.

779
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:41,437
Had seven truckloads
of champagne and cognac...

780
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:46,037
...out of the wine cellars
out of the Eagle's Nest.

781
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:49,273
So we stayed
pretty well oiled for a while.

782
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:52,637
oh, that champagne was good.
oh, that was good.

783
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:58,113
I started drinking it one day, and l
drank until about midnight that night.

784
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:03,149
I went to the back and went to sleep.
I didn't wake up the next day.

785
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:06,630
I made a two-day thing out of it.

786
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:12,033
It didn't taste like it would hurt you.
It tasted like ginger ale.

787
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:16,478
That was the only time I remember,
when I was in service...

788
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:19,074
...that the company fell out
in their underwear.

789
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:21,959
We didn't even have
to dress, you know.

790
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:27,911
Everybody was looped, and so we fell
out in line formation in our underwear.

791
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:31,311
They're enJoying themselves.
They're at peace with the world.

792
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:35,678
They have a big, happy,
satisfied grin on their face.

793
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:39,992
It was a paradise for
a soldier to move into.

794
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:46,079
I had no problem with the looting,
because I came down through Germany.

795
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:51,030
And I had seen the Holocaust.

796
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:56,789
And I had seen what the Germans
had done to the jewish race.

797
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:02,512
And I had seen what they
had done to the displaced persons...

798
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:06,468
...and what they had done
in their occupation of France.

799
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:12,909
And what they had done to their
occupation in Holland, Belgium.

800
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:19,634
So that by taking over
their homes for a few nights...

801
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:22,837
...to bed down my men....

802
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:28,028
And if they picked up
a few trinkets, I had no problem.

803
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:45,230
Nobody has ever taken their time
to tell you how to handle a surrender.

804
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:53,794
We'll talk about it when we get there.
Here we are. How do you handle this?

805
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:02,113
The German army
was a well-disciplined army.

806
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:04,953
Those prisoners that
come down out of the Alps...

807
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:07,998
...they came down in formation.
They marched down.

808
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:11,675
They didn't drag down
or nothing like that.

809
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:16,868
They came down
as defeated soldiers.

810
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:21,477
We thought the Germans were
the evilest people in the world...

811
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:27,112
... but as the war went along, we found
out also, it wasn't the Germans...

812
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:31,876
... per se, it was the SS
and the special troops.

813
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:36,318
They were the ones
that could kill their own people...

814
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:41,270
...and the regular German
soldier was not that way.

815
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:44,989
one of those prisoners
handed me this little book...

816
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:48,709
...and it was a Catholic
prayer book for the Mass.

817
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:53,829
And I realized, " Hey, I haven't got
Nazis here. I've got some Catholics."

818
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,913
And I've got a Catholic good enough
to stick one of these in his pocket.

819
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:03,757
I've thought we might've been friends.
We might've had a lot in common.

820
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:09,040
We might've liked to fish. He might've
liked to hunt. You never know.

821
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:14,035
They did what they were supposed to,
and I did what I was supposed to.

822
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:19,718
But under different circumstances,
we might've been good friends.

823
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:24,195
I have a great deal of respect
for them as soldiers.

824
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:27,318
They were very good soldiers.

825
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:29,948
But they're still enemy...

826
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:35,991
...so they must
be controlled as prisoners.

827
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:41,679
when it reached the level
of surrender for company...

828
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:44,035
...and smaller units...

829
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:47,351
... I was assigned this maJor...

830
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:51,115
...and when he walked in...

831
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:54,431
...he presented me this pistol...

832
01:04:54,600 --> 01:05:00,516
...and offered
his personal surrender...

833
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:09,430
...which, naturally,
I accepted gratefully.

834
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:14,237
So that would be the end
of the war for his men...

835
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:17,949
...and this is basically
the end of the war for my men.

836
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:20,429
And the significance is...

837
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:25,276
...it wasn't until later, after he gave
me his pistol and I had a chance...

838
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:29,678
...to look at it carefully,
that I realized this pistol...

839
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:32,235
... had never been fired.

840
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:35,473
There was no blood on it.

841
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:40,311
That's the way all wars should end...

842
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:43,870
...with an agreement
with no blood on it.

843
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:47,919
And I assure you, this pistol
has never, never been fired...

844
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:52,551
...since I've had it,
and it will not be fired.

845
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,674
we didn't come home
and flout ourselves.

846
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:11,593
I didn't come home and say
I was a war hero.

847
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:16,197
I came home and went back to it like
we did before war. just go to work...

848
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:18,510
...and live our life.

849
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:23,234
I think it was difficult
for most fellows coming back.

850
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:28,554
They didn't know what they were going
to do when they got out. I didn't.

851
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,711
Went to work for a coal company.

852
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:34,350
Did some bartendering
and ran a pool hall.

853
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:37,478
T ook up a course in
ornamental horticulture.

854
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:41,872
It didn't pay very much,
but I met a lot of nice people.

855
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:48,036
I went to work where
I was working before the war.

856
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:50,077
It was Caterpillar T ractor Company.

857
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:53,516
I became an industrial arts
and social studies teacher.

858
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:57,195
The spring of '46, I took
a boat to Ketchikan, Alaska.

859
01:06:57,360 --> 01:07:01,797
I went to work for the government,
a letter carrier for 37 years.

860
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:06,875
I built homes. I was in construction.
I went into hard work, tedious work.

861
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:10,555
I'd done everything.
You name it, I done it.

862
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:14,394
I ended up working
on the waterfront.

863
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:16,790
I went with the ClA
in Washington.

864
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:18,678
Got my degree in 1948.

865
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:21,832
After the war, I taught
for almost 30 years.

866
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,958
Got a job working for
Nixon Nitration works.

867
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:28,112
I was making $75 a week.

868
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:30,919
We've never become
wealthy in life...

869
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:35,232
... but we have a lot of other wealth
that means more than that.

870
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:40,155
Everyone done well,
I done well too, thank God.

871
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:50,318
I want to welcome you...

872
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:55,679
...to our banquet tonight to celebrate
the ending of a fine reunion.

873
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:57,637
Thank you all for coming.

874
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:01,349
I want to extend the best wishes
to all the men from company E506.

875
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:05,115
I love you, God bless you all.
Thank you.

876
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:08,669
The purpose the reunions serve...

877
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:12,719
...is to give us a chance to get
together and talk to each other.

878
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:17,715
we relive some
of the Army experiences.

879
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:21,270
But we have great respect...

880
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:24,910
...and, you might say,
affection for each other.

881
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:28,516
The type of affection you get
when you've lived through...

882
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:31,478
... many dangerous
situations together...

883
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:34,791
...and have learned that
you can rely on each other.

884
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:40,432
If you see them today, that bond's
there. The bond you can't explain.

885
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:45,833
Soon as you see them, you're thinking
of battles, thinking of it to yourself.

886
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,514
The men stand out amongst each other.

887
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:53,834
There's an intimacy develops and like
nothing that I've ever experienced...

888
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,278
... not in college, not with
any other group of people.

889
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:03,070
we're a strange bunch of dudes,
as far as I'm concerned.

890
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:09,475
T o be this close after all these years,
that's the thing that gets me...

891
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:12,279
...is we're like brothers.

892
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:14,112
I'm back in my youth now.

893
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:18,432
When I get to these guys,
I'm back when I went in the service.

894
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:24,320
It's fantastic.
I'd like to make 20 more reunions.

895
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:28,393
we had a lot of real
good times in there.

896
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:31,950
Those are the times
you really remember, you know?

897
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:37,194
A lot of those is what we kid each
other about at these reunions a lot.

898
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:40,989
And then you had a lot of bad times.

899
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:44,670
My family didn't know
anything about it...

900
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:47,434
...and I just didn't tell them.

901
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,478
I just, you know,
figured it was something...

902
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:54,394
...that didn't need talking about.
It was done, over with.

903
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:58,917
We didn't know Shifty the way
the men knew Shifty, you know.

904
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:03,870
He started talking about it
just in the last five or six years.

905
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:05,996
Last five, I'd say.

906
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:10,073
It was like he--
That was another life, you know.

907
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:16,156
He was another person, and we weren't
aware of the stuff he went through...

908
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:18,117
...things he had seen.

909
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:22,432
It didn't even dawn on me
that he had killed people.

910
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:26,275
I really admire my dad, my daddy.

911
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:30,433
He's a good guy.
He's a real strong guy.

912
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:34,957
We travel a lot, and we've been
to France and to that cemetery.

913
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:39,875
It's incredible. There's crosses
upon crosses lined up perfectly...

914
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:45,797
...as far as the eye can see, and then
there's a cliff and the ocean.

915
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:49,158
These weren't
just anonymous statistics.

916
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:53,199
These were people I knew,
and I told my daughter, I said:

917
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:57,672
"This guy here died at age 19 or 20."

918
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:01,310
A whole life never lived.

919
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:04,358
No family...

920
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:05,748
... nothing.

921
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:08,115
No children...

922
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:13,832
... no opportunity to have satisfaction
in building a life, nothing.

923
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:18,313
When I went there, I said,
" Dad, my gosh, you were so lucky."

924
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:21,631
He looked at me and said,
"Yeah, l'm very lucky."

925
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:24,189
And he started crying.

926
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:29,475
These guys have been together
in the absolute base experiences...

927
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:32,950
...of human existence.
They were there with each other...

928
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:38,069
...thinking you're gonna die or seeing
people dying all around you.

929
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:41,391
And there they went day after day...

930
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:46,992
...and I admire that and held my father,
even on his tombstone...

931
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:50,994
...as Sgt. Joe T Oye.

932
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:55,918
506 PIR 101st Airborne Division.

933
01:11:56,080 --> 01:12:01,154
That's what he wanted on his
tombstone. It meant that much to him.

934
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:15,313
How it happened that
those various individuals...

935
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:18,040
...ended up in E Company,
I don't know.

936
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:23,194
But as you know, every Army unit
thinks it's the best...

937
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:26,477
...but we knew we were the best.

938
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:33,359
I think about the guys
more than anything.

939
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,750
I think about most
of them every day.

940
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:40,948
It's something that's etched
in your memory, I guess.

941
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:44,353
It'll never leave either.

942
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:48,875
Am I proud of having served
in that outfit? You bet your life.

943
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:52,077
I wore that eagle
on my right shoulder for 1 8 years.

944
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:54,435
Probably the proudest thing
in my whole life...

945
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:58,434
...was having been
in Easy Company 506.

946
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:04,512
The heroes had crosses
over their heads...

947
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:07,399
...the ones that are buried
in the cemeteries.

948
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:10,028
Those are the true heroes, not us.

949
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:12,475
We're just part of the works.

950
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:16,758
And we thank God we got
back alive. That's all.

951
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:23,515
How would you like to be a mother
or a father to a son never come back?

952
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:29,757
The son and the mother and the father
are the heroes of world war ll...

953
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:32,354
... not the guys that come home.

954
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:37,075
Let me say this...

955
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:41,951
... I believe there's very,
very few heroes...

956
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:46,830
...that came back from the war.
They're still over there.

957
01:13:56,200 --> 01:14:00,955
Do you remember the letter
that Mike Ranney wrote me?

958
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:03,634
Do you remember how he ended it?

959
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:09,429
" I cherish the memories
of a question my grandson...

960
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:14,037
...asked me the other day
when he said:

961
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:18,193
'Grandpa, were you
a hero in the war? '

962
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:23,353
Grandpa said, 'No...

963
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:30,755
... but I served
in a company of heroes.'

964
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:53,951
Joe T Oye.
oh, there was a big mick.

965
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:58,955
And we used to have a few beers
at night, and I'd sing.

966
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:02,234
Guarnere would
come over and sing.

967
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:04,197
He'd say to Guarnere:

968
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:07,875
"Guarnere, you're Italian,
you don't know this song."

969
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:10,713
Guarnere could sing
it better than he did.

970
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:12,472
"Bridget O'Flynn."

971
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:14,358
How's it go?

972
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:12,756
Now, that's the song T Oye liked,
and that's what we sang.

973
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:16,634
You only needed a sisal of beer.
Two beers you were drunk...

974
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:19,473
...because you were
in great physical condition.

975
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:22,712
You were too piqued, you know...

976
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:27,351
...and two beers you were as high
as Georgia pine, you know.
