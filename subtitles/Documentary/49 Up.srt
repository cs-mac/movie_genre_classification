1
00:00:12,945 --> 00:00:15,080
I'm going to work
in Woolworth's.

2
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:18,016
When I grow up, I want
to be an astronaut.

3
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,385
When I get married, I would
like to have two children.

4
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:23,822
My heart's desire is
to see my daddy.

5
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:26,858
I don't want to answer that.

6
00:00:29,361 --> 00:00:31,729
(narrator) This is no ordinary
outing to the zoo.

7
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:34,866
It's a very special occasion.

8
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,002
We've brought these children
together for the very first time.

9
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:39,371
(screaming)

10
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,906
They're like any other children,
except that they come

11
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:44,609
from startlingly different
backgrounds.

12
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:46,812
Stop it at once.

13
00:00:46,814 --> 00:00:50,681
We've brought these children together
because we wanted a glimpse of England

14
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:53,184
in the year 2000.

15
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:56,454
The shop steward and the
executive of the year 2000

16
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:58,890
are now seven years old.

17
00:01:02,428 --> 00:01:05,763
(Michael Apted) In 1964,
World In Action made "Seven up!"

18
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:10,602
and we've been back to film
these children every seven years.

19
00:01:12,071 --> 00:01:14,406
They are now 49.

20
00:01:18,644 --> 00:01:22,113
Is it important to fight? Yes.

21
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:28,286
Tony was brought up
in the East End of London.

22
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:30,288
Want to be a jockey
when I grow up.

23
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,225
Yeah, I want to be a jockey
when I grow up.

24
00:01:35,427 --> 00:01:38,363
At 14, he was already
an apprentice

25
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:41,566
at Tommy Gosling's
racing stable at Epsom.

26
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:44,402
At 15, he'd left school.

27
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,743
This is a photo finish,
when I rode at Newbury.

28
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:53,744
I'm the one with the white cap.

29
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:55,780
I was beaten a length
and a half off third,

30
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,182
and I had a photo finish.

31
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:00,251
(Michael) Do you
regret not making it?

32
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:03,855
I would have given my right arm
at the time to become a jockey,

33
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:05,757
but now...

34
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,093
Well, I wasn't good enough.

35
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:10,928
(Michael) What will you do if
you don't make it as a jockey?

36
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,297
I don't know.

37
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:16,000
If I knew I couldn't be one,
I'd get out of the game.

38
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:18,336
Wouldn't bother.

39
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:21,106
What do you think
you would do then?

40
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:22,841
Learn on taxis.

41
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:27,144
At 21, he was
on the knowledge,

42
00:02:27,146 --> 00:02:30,849
and by 28, he owned his own cab.

43
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:33,251
It's surprising who
you pick up, you see.

44
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:36,454
I once met Kojak.
I picked him up.

45
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:39,858
And Warren Mitchell,
Alf Garnett, you know.

46
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,593
Have you got a girlfriend?
No.

47
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:45,029
Would you like to have
a girlfriend?

48
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:46,497
No.

49
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,199
You understand four F's?

50
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:50,368
Find 'em, feed 'em
and forget 'em.

51
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,337
The other "F" - I'll let you
use your own discriminish.

52
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:57,742
I mean, this one
I tried to do the 3 F's,

53
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:00,111
but I couldn't forget her.

54
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:02,747
I went to a discothèque.

55
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,849
He was in the pub earlier on,

56
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,552
and afterwards we
went to a discothèque.

57
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:09,955
And Tony was standing there,
and I just -

58
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:13,058
From there, I just - that was it.

59
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,993
(laughs)

60
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:18,062
Couldn't get rid of him.
(laughs)

61
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:22,033
We have our ups and downs.
No more than anyone else.

62
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,570
I think you gotta work
at a marriage.

63
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:28,640
I think all marriages
go through stages.

64
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:31,376
You can't stand each other.
You go through, you know -

65
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:35,647
I think, "Oh, god, I hate him.
I wish he'd get out." I do.

66
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:37,815
We've been to the
edge of the cliff

67
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:39,817
and looked over
a couple of times,

68
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:43,955
and we've always seemed
to sort of go back,

69
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:46,458
and we've sort of
stayed the course.

70
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:50,628
But I must say - I mean,
it's not easy being married.

71
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:54,532
By 42, Tony and Debbie
had left the East End

72
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:57,435
and moved to Woodford in Essex.

73
00:03:57,437 --> 00:04:01,673
We were going to put a conservatory
here, but if you look along here,

74
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:04,074
we put a patio in and
the pond for the fish,

75
00:04:04,076 --> 00:04:06,477
but the only thing I ever done

76
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:09,447
was I planted them three trees.

77
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,549
Well, since you was
last here, Michael...

78
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:13,651
We had small trees,
if you remember.

79
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:17,588
Now they've sort of grown a bit.

80
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,091
(Michael) So why
are the trees singed?

81
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:23,561
We was burning some
Rubbish at the back

82
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:26,564
and set light to the tree,
and there we all were,

83
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:30,034
sort of like throwing
all buckets of water over it,

84
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:32,269
and sadly enough,
it singed the tree.

85
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,854
At 49, they've taken out a second
mortgage on the London house

86
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:54,125
and sunk the money in
a holiday home in Spain.

87
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,294
I'm very pleased with the house.

88
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,331
I said the progress we made in the
little space of time that we've had

89
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,499
to work here and get it
all sort of shipshape

90
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,334
I think is done, really,

91
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:06,170
to the testament
of my wife Debbie.

92
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:07,672
As per usual.

93
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,407
(Michael laughs)

94
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,509
(Tony) Debbie went
to the furniture shop,

95
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:13,978
and she sort of picked
all the furniture.

96
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,682
All what you see is all
Debbie's choice of furniture

97
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:20,118
and her, really, sort of style.

98
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,653
The floor -

99
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:25,390
We were led to believe
that we had a choice of tiling,

100
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:28,393
whether it's a light beige
or, you know, light brown.

101
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:31,395
That's the first I've heard
that we had a choice,

102
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:33,230
'cause I would have had plain.

103
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:36,067
I've just gone into the neighbours'
house, and they've got all plain.

104
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,069
Well, there you go.
I never got told that.

105
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:41,072
He said it was a choice that we
had when we suggested to buy it,

106
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:43,407
so that was where
the mistake was made.

107
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:45,510
Because you don't listen.
Say that again.

108
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:48,646
You don't listen.
Can't hear you. (laughs)

109
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:52,684
Tony and Debbie still
work as London cabbies.

110
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:56,354
We sold our cabs because we are
going to spend more time out here.

111
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,090
So it's not really conducive
to own a cab, is it?

112
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:02,594
Because the cab will be left
out on the drive or, you know -

113
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:07,498
It's pointless, so we just
hired a cab independently now.

114
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,903
I'm working harder now
than I really ever have done,

115
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:15,573
but I feel that
it's for something.

116
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:18,108
Son, why do you want to be
a cab driver for, mate?

117
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,211
All the holidays in Spain
every year...

118
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,547
But, son, it's hard work out there.
You're not reaching me yet.

119
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,883
Not getting to you. No, you're
not getting to me. All right?

120
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,217
Now be bigger.
Dominate me, all right? Son...

121
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:30,455
At 28, Tony was taking
acting lessons.

122
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:34,391
Now he supplements his income
with occasional TV jobs.

123
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:36,393
(Tony) Oi!

124
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:38,395
That's all I got on me.

125
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:41,666
Mate, if I had a pound for every time
I've heard that, I'd be a rich man.

126
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:44,568
Get him!

127
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,471
A guy contacted me
from my agency,

128
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:49,773
from my acting agency,
and I got in touch with him.

129
00:06:49,775 --> 00:06:55,646
And he writes plays, and he's
been inspired by your up programs,

130
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:58,682
which go all round the world,
and he saw it.

131
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:03,054
And we got together
and we wrote a biographical play

132
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:05,857
all about my life story.

133
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:09,494
We took one of these episodes over to
New York and done it on a play reading.

134
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:12,997
And I got up, playing
the lead role, you know,

135
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:16,233
and it just blew the roof off.

136
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:21,205
And we're looking for someone to
pick it up and put it on stage.

137
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:24,442
(woman) Would everybody please sit
round now, get on with their work?

138
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,345
I don't want to see
any backs to me.

139
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:29,447
Shouldn't be anybody
turning round.

140
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,650
Tony, do you hear as well?

141
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:37,622
Get on with your work
at the front.

142
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:40,090
Tony!
Don't turn round again.

143
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:42,760
There's only one ambition,
and, really, I want a baby son.

144
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:45,596
If I see my baby son, that will
be my ambition fulfilled.

145
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,566
No one knows that.
Only you know.

146
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:50,968
Debbie and Tony
have three children -

147
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:57,175
Nicky, Jody and Perri.

148
00:07:57,177 --> 00:08:00,077
Nicky's doing quite well.
He's still a French polisher.

149
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,546
It's an old-time profession,
as you know.

150
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:04,549
He's working for a firm,

151
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:06,751
and he's very happy
in his work, isn't he?

152
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:11,088
He's been brought up
very respectful to people,

153
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,090
very well-mannered person,

154
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:16,894
He's a hard worker.

155
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,397
Jody, I mean,
at this present time,

156
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:25,603
she's just - relies on us
a great deal, and...

157
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:30,875
She's been very scarred with
a relationship that she was in.

158
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:33,711
Her relationship with her
first love of her own life

159
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:36,480
was very turbulent,

160
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:40,251
but he's the father of her kid.

161
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:43,487
We're going to make sure
she gets through it.

162
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:46,624
And it's been quite a
strain on Debbie and I

163
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:49,627
to see her in that
sort of situation.

164
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,995
I'm very proud of Perri as well.

165
00:08:51,997 --> 00:08:54,999
She got in the post office,
and that's what's she doing.

166
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,868
Postman Pel.
That's our postman Pel.

167
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,570
She loves it, you know.
She works hard.

168
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:02,306
She's up at four
in the morning.

169
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:04,075
She's got a lovely boyfriend.

170
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:06,177
He loves her more
than you can imagine,

171
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:08,879
and he's certainly
got my blessing.

172
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,549
Big lad, very nice guy,
loves his football.

173
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,485
You know, typical East End kid.

174
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:16,854
Go. Aah!

175
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:19,390
Head up, son.
That's too quick.

176
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,526
We are the backbone
for the kids, aren't we?

177
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:24,462
Yeah, but I think your parents
are anyway, you know.

178
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:25,996
Your parents are -

179
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:29,700
You never visualize anything ever
happening to your parents, do you?

180
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:33,370
You think they are there forever.

181
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:36,673
Toni's five, Harry's
four, nearly five,

182
00:09:36,675 --> 00:09:39,443
and little Pru, she's nearly two.

183
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:42,279
No, three.
She's three.

184
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:45,617
I'm an hands-on granddad.

185
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:48,919
I love my grandchildren
more, if you can imagine,

186
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,755
I'd say not my own kids,
but in a different way.

187
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:56,027
It's an obsession
of love, you know.

188
00:09:56,029 --> 00:10:00,565
You see these grandchildren,
and they're part of you.

189
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:02,733
No, granddad. No.

190
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:05,402
They're hard work at times.

191
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:07,405
We don't mind, though,
Michael. I mean -

192
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:09,807
'cause you slow down and you don't
realize you're slowing down.

193
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,976
All I understand is dogs' prices,

194
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:15,146
girls, knowledge,
roads, streets, squares

195
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:17,281
and mum and dad and love.

196
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,516
That's all I understand,
that's all I want to understand.

197
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:21,986
By the time he was 35,

198
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:25,489
both Tony's parents had died.

199
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:29,059
I'm at the graveside.
I'm talking to her, little things.

200
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:31,061
I've got all images
running through me mind,

201
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:33,597
sayin' like, "Tony, go downstairs,
get me fine weights."

202
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,166
You know, "one and a penny."

203
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:37,468
And I used to go in the shop.

204
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,903
She used to throw the cotton
in an hair curler

205
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:41,905
over the landing,

206
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:45,876
and I used to tie the cigarettes
on this bit of cotton.

207
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:47,878
She used to pull 'em up,
and she goes -

208
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,713
See her in the end -
(inhales)

209
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:53,116
"Thanks, Tone. See you
after school. Be good."

210
00:10:53,118 --> 00:10:55,453
And that's the way it was.

211
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:57,822
We knew my dad
was terminally ill,

212
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,490
although having said that,

213
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,526
still didn't make it
any easier for us.

214
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:07,064
When my dad died,
I took it really hard.

215
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,799
I can't.

216
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:17,841
Nellie Rose is - my mum,
'cause her name is Nell,

217
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,844
and her mother's name's Rose,

218
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:22,679
so my Jody and all the family

219
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:25,616
were conjuring up some names
that we could name it.

220
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:28,652
Jody at the finish
said "Nellie Rose",

221
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:30,154
the name of our mums.

222
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:35,326
Sometimes on a Saturday morning
I go to the pictures,

223
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:39,063
sometimes with my friends
and sometimes with him.

224
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:41,298
You don't.
I do.

225
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,567
She don't.

226
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:45,936
(Michael) And why did
you fall in love with him?

227
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:47,304
Don't know.

228
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:50,174
I don't know how you put up
with me for so long.

229
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:53,210
I don't know how. Sometimes
I don't know how I stand him.

230
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,413
Who's to say
in another ten years

231
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:56,947
me and him might have split up.

232
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:59,983
Quite possible, you know.
You don't know.

233
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:03,754
When we filmed
Debbie and Tony at 42,

234
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:06,357
the marriage seemed
to be in trouble.

235
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:08,960
I'm not proud at all to say this,

236
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:12,530
but situations arise that -

237
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:16,833
I have - have had regretful
behaviour various times,

238
00:12:16,835 --> 00:12:18,902
but through...

239
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,973
You got caught, and that was it.

240
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:23,240
That's, you know -

241
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,909
I'm not lying about
the fact, you know.

242
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,813
You could always cover it up
and suggest other things,

243
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:31,949
but, you know, it's true
and let it be true.

244
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:34,318
You caught him?

245
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,385
Yeah.

246
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:37,688
What happened?

247
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,424
Well, you know, it was touch and go

248
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,928
whether we carried
on from it or not.

249
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:47,465
I did feel, you know, I wish
things that were said then

250
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:49,467
was never said.

251
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,902
I mean, Perri wouldn't go
to school for three weeks.

252
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:54,071
She wouldn't go out
the door, you know.

253
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:57,275
She was quite upset
about it all, and, you know.

254
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,376
I think it was a big shock,

255
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:03,213
because, you know,
you are their mum and dad.

256
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:05,349
They're tangerines, ain't they?

257
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,318
We got on from there.

258
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,353
It's sort of seven years
down the line,

259
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:12,255
and we are happy as can be now.

260
00:13:12,257 --> 00:13:14,458
Karen told me
to get me knickers here.

261
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,460
She said they're better
than Marks & Spencer's.

262
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,162
(laughs)
(laughs)

263
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:20,731
Well, let's hope
they're easy to get off.

264
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:24,401
There's 96% English here

265
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:27,705
who bought all their houses in Spain,

266
00:13:27,707 --> 00:13:30,641
and this is where they
shop every Saturday.

267
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:34,978
It's just like an old petticoat
lane market, sort of years ago.

268
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,581
How much are they, darling?
(speaks Spanish)

269
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:41,185
What I like - it's so relaxing
down here, Michael.

270
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:43,787
You just walk along, and things
are happening, the music's playing.

271
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:47,291
There's an English pub there
you can just go in,

272
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:50,294
and it's really home from
home but with the weather.

273
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:57,568
From here - it's
about 200 yards along -

274
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,904
There's going to be
all commercial units here.

275
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:05,009
My intentions would be to turn one
of these units into a sports bar.

276
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:08,045
We're putting all tellies
round in a sports sort of way,

277
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:11,048
football shirts and
all that memorabilia.

278
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:15,452
This is tomorrow for me.
This is my future here.

279
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:17,387
If I happen to get
some sort of business

280
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:20,124
and I was to bring my Nicky

281
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:22,526
or bring my Jody
and my Perri out here,

282
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,528
then I'll have
the best of both worlds.

283
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,530
I'll have my family here,

284
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,932
plus, the kids could be schooled.

285
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:31,168
Well, they can get what
they want, can't they?

286
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,170
If you have got to work for it,

287
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,806
and it's them who can just
ask for money and get it,

288
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:37,841
and they can buy what they want.

289
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:42,079
I feel that the economy
will bust within five years

290
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:46,851
because people like myself have been
giving and giving all the time.

291
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:48,852
We're hardworking,
family type of people

292
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:52,590
who have contributed everything
under this Tony Blair's government.

293
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:54,925
We have to work, we have
to maintain the mortgage,

294
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:57,294
we have to bring up
the families,

295
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:59,296
and I feel that I've had enough.

296
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:01,098
I've had enough of
working all these hours.

297
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,167
Congestion charges,
£40 a week now.

298
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:08,372
Zero tolerance with the police
with parking tickets.

299
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:09,606
We're paying.

300
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:12,843
Now someone's gettin'
it at our expense.

301
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:15,345
Does it make you sad

302
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:17,781
that you're going to have to
leave your roots, your country?

303
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:20,550
I can't even go out in the
East End now to have a drink.

304
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:23,854
The pubs are literally
closing down.

305
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:28,659
It's - other cultures are buyin'
all my old tradition up.

306
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,761
Everyone likes their own culture,

307
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,164
and I'm no different
from anybody else,

308
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:36,834
but being in England,
if you suggest this,

309
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:39,937
you are targeted as,
you know, an oddball.

310
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,905
"Oh, you mustn't say that."

311
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:44,375
Safety by numbers, eh,
is that what they call it?

312
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:46,343
On the contrary,
I would say, I'm sorry.

313
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,812
If you don't like it,
it's not to be offensive,

314
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:50,814
it's just to let you know

315
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:54,451
that my way of being brought up
was all my own people,

316
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:58,155
and I like being with me own people,
and I'm a traditionalist.

317
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:01,391
How much do you want
play for? Fiver?

318
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,861
10 pesetas.

319
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:05,129
Whoa!

320
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,897
(Michael) What's the dream now?

321
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,898
It is to be happy, which I am.

322
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:12,602
I am happy now being healthy
with all my family.

323
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:16,040
We all want happy and health for our
family. Anything else will be a bonus.

324
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:18,042
And that's all I really want.

325
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:20,043
And that's all I'm really after.

326
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:21,645
I don't want no more
or less than that.

327
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,247
Ohh.

328
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:26,116
Unlucky Tony.
Unlucky.

329
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:29,253
Some people from Africa come here,

330
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:33,891
but they - when they go,
they put their clothes on.

331
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:36,660
Jackie, Lynn and Sue

332
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,862
all grew up in the
East End of London

333
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:42,499
and were friends in
the same junior school.

334
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,169
With this school, we do
metalwork and woodwork,

335
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,304
and the boys do cookery.

336
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:51,808
We had a teacher at school
that his favourite ploy was,

337
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:55,446
"All you girls want
to do is walk out,

338
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:56,947
get married, have babies

339
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:58,949
and push a pram
down the street

340
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:01,251
with a fag hanging
outside your mouth."

341
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:03,320
I think that we
all could have gone

342
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:05,556
any way that we wanted
to at the time

343
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:07,057
within our capabilities,

344
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:11,328
I mean, we just -
we chose our own jobs.

345
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,330
But we only had a
limited choice anyway.

346
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:16,633
I mean, truth be told, we didn't
have a choice of private education,

347
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:18,836
because they couldn't
have afforded it anyway.

348
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:21,072
Change is too much, Mike.

349
00:17:21,074 --> 00:17:25,843
Our lives are changing
far too much, all of us.

350
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:29,012
To be honest, when you look
at the seven-year-old us,

351
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:31,081
it's difficult
to believe it is us.

352
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,917
I mean, it's like it's someone
else you're looking at,

353
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,953
this little cute thing.

354
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:38,555
I mean, I can't remember being...
Well, I wasn't cute.

355
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,692
I would like to get married
when I grow up.

356
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:44,895
Well, I don't know
what sort of boy,

357
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:50,668
but I think one that...

358
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,802
That's not got a lot of money

359
00:17:52,804 --> 00:17:56,607
but he has got some money,
not a lot.

360
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:58,608
(Michael) Have you got
any boyfriends?

361
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:02,412
Um...
Um...

362
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:05,582
That's personal, innit?

363
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:10,053
By the time she was 21,
Jackie had married Mick

364
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:12,589
and moved to the
outskirts of London.

365
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,826
It was horrific, really, what
happened to the wedding cake.

366
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:19,062
I mean, it was sitting right
in between Mick and myself

367
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:22,466
when suddenly the columns
just completely gave way

368
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:25,235
and it just all
sort of fell into one.

369
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:29,506
I would say on average,
19 is probably too young.

370
00:18:31,042 --> 00:18:34,878
By 35 she was divorced.

371
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,782
We decided ourselves, I mean
just between the two of us,

372
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:42,119
we knew it wasn't
going any further.

373
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,621
We both knew, I think,
that at the end of the day,

374
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,223
we would be happier
leading our own lives.

375
00:18:47,225 --> 00:18:48,359
...Jackie.

376
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:50,361
She and Mick had decided early on

377
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:52,629
that they didn't want children.

378
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:56,600
Basically I would say
because I'm far too selfish.

379
00:18:56,602 --> 00:19:02,239
I enjoy doing what I want
when I want and how I want,

380
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,675
and certainly at the moment

381
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:08,478
I can't see any way around that.

382
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,517
Oh, and... This one on.

383
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,253
Here we go. Oh, yeah.

384
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:19,523
Had a brief but very
sweet relationship,

385
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,659
the result of which was Charlie.

386
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,960
Give us a cuddle.

387
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:26,262
I don't really want
Charlie to be an only.

388
00:19:26,264 --> 00:19:28,265
I'd love him to have
brothers and sisters,

389
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:30,267
but not necessarily loads of 'em.

390
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:33,436
Just, you know -
one would do, actually.

391
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:37,140
Right, Charlie.
There's yours.

392
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:40,977
Please eat it all up.

393
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:42,846
And James.

394
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,749
Thanks, mum.
Good boy.

395
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:50,186
And last but not least...

396
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:52,222
Going to eat that one for me?

397
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:54,491
After her relationship
with Charlie's father ended,

398
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:57,194
she met Ian, and they
moved to Scotland

399
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,696
and had two more sons.

400
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:02,032
James.
(James) All right.

401
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,434
By 42, they had split up.

402
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:05,569
Lee.

403
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,742
Go on, Lee.
Go and get 'em.

404
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:14,377
At 49, despite the split,

405
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:19,049
the family all live in
the same area of Scotland.

406
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,851
There's your dad!

407
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:23,454
Lee and Charlie's birthdays
are only a month apart,

408
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:25,455
so we tend to do
something in between

409
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:28,258
so that we celebrate
both their birthdays.

410
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,327
So we usually go somewhere
like amusement park.

411
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:36,099
(Michael) That Lee's got
a lot of nerve, hasn't he?

412
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:38,135
And a little bit
of bravado, I think.

413
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:40,737
Because his older
brothers had said no,

414
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,874
I think he decided,
"I'm going to do this one."

415
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:46,009
Yeah!
(laughs)

416
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:47,411
Whoo!

417
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:50,781
Has Charlie shown any interest
as to his father?

418
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:55,886
No. Ian's his father
as far as he's concerned.

419
00:20:55,888 --> 00:20:57,521
He knows and the other boy knows,

420
00:20:57,523 --> 00:21:01,257
the whole family know
that biologically he's not,

421
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:05,228
but in every respect
Ian is his father,

422
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,097
always has been,

423
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:10,567
he just done everything with
him, been everything to him,

424
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:12,602
taught him everything.

425
00:21:14,338 --> 00:21:18,408
What would you do if you had
lots of money, about £2?

426
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:21,344
I would buy meself
a new nice house,

427
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:25,282
you know, one that's
all nice and comfy.

428
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,851
Oh, quite like that.

429
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:30,520
Jackie suffers from
rheumatoid arthritis

430
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:33,056
and lives off disability benefit.

431
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:34,691
(Michael) How is money for you?

432
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:39,363
Could do with more, as just
about everybody would say,

433
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:40,764
but we manage.

434
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,465
We cut our cloth accordingly.

435
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:45,368
You've got x amount,
and that's what you do.

436
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,370
I can imagine you in that.

437
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:49,940
(Michael) Has Liz got
anything to do with that?

438
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:52,675
Liz has always got something
to do with that.

439
00:21:52,677 --> 00:21:57,080
Ian's her son, but she
also says that I'm here

440
00:21:57,082 --> 00:22:01,551
and she's got three grandchildren
here that she loves dearly,

441
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:04,554
and she will be there for us.

442
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:08,057
James has just had a trip
to Alton Towers

443
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:09,493
with the school.

444
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:11,828
Suddenly she'll say,
"You pay the trip,

445
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,830
I'll give him
his spending money",

446
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:17,567
Which is brilliant, because it
just makes life easier for me.

447
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:20,337
Now, you've moved in
the last seven years.

448
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,838
Tell me about that.

449
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,974
Because of the arthritis
that I've got,

450
00:22:23,976 --> 00:22:27,077
I needed to come
to the ground floor,

451
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,179
and this particular
area that I'm in now

452
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,181
is an area that I like.

453
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,517
It's close to Liz,
my mother-in-law,

454
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:37,287
so from that point of
view it's - it suits.

455
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:40,056
The school's across
the road for the boys,

456
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:41,558
good neighbours,

457
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,894
which makes a difference
wherever your property is,

458
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:48,532
it's how the East End used
to be about 30 years ago.

459
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:51,768
Doors used to be open, the neighbours
all watched for each other.

460
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:54,404
If one neighbour had a problem,
the other neighbours helped out.

461
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:55,939
That's how it is here.

462
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:58,942
That's what this place is
like. It's like a village.

463
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:03,479
We deal with the problems with
the boys as and when they arise.

464
00:23:03,481 --> 00:23:05,715
I mean, you've always
got the problem of drink

465
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:09,085
and drugs and smoking
and not smoking

466
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:11,655
and, you know,
that sort of thing.

467
00:23:11,657 --> 00:23:13,857
I mean, Charlie's of an age now

468
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:17,995
where I can't mother him, but
I can't be his friend, either.

469
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:21,732
He wants to work,
he wants to leave school,

470
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:25,502
and he wants to get an
apprenticeship to car mechanics,

471
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:29,139
but the chances of him doing
that are probably very slim.

472
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:32,943
Lee, take your time, babe.
You'll make yourself ill.

473
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:34,144
Don't care.

474
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:37,280
James tends to be a bit
of a computer freak.

475
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:42,585
He wants to produce
and make his own games.

476
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,687
(boy) That looks just
like your brain - mush.

477
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:47,791
Lee tends to be, like,
the outspoken one

478
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:50,694
and a bit like I was
at his age, really.

479
00:23:50,696 --> 00:23:53,463
In fact, he's very much
like I was at his age.

480
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:56,767
Is that a worry?

481
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:58,869
I think that's -
that's terrible.

482
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:02,172
How dare you say that to me?
Is that a worry?

483
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:05,174
Why would that be a worry?
Do you think I've turned out badly?

484
00:24:05,176 --> 00:24:07,377
No, but sometimes
when you look at yourself,

485
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:09,446
you don't always see things
you like in yourself,

486
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,648
and then you see them
in your child and you think...

487
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,851
Yeah, but I never said he'd
picked up all of my traits.

488
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:17,855
I actually think he's
picked up probably the best.

489
00:24:17,857 --> 00:24:20,390
(fussing) If you're not
going to play nicely...

490
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,158
Right, go to bed, then.
No!

491
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,862
He has a temper that isn't as
bad as when he was younger,

492
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:29,132
but it is something
that he knows about

493
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:32,302
and he tries very hard to control.

494
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,304
Does your temper
get you into trouble?

495
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:37,272
You're probably the best
one to answer that.

496
00:24:37,274 --> 00:24:39,642
Does it?

497
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:42,978
I mean, you and I have had
arguments on occasions.

498
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:46,448
Did you meet enough men before
you decided who to marry?

499
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:49,318
I mean, what do you mean
by "settle down"?

500
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,088
I mean, if you think that getting
married, as far as we're concerned,

501
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:55,991
is a case of going to work,
come home, cook tea for hubby,

502
00:24:55,993 --> 00:24:59,294
going to bed, getting up, going
to work, you're totally mistaken.

503
00:24:59,296 --> 00:25:02,664
(Michael) I like it
when you shout at me.

504
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:05,968
I'm not sure you do, really.

505
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:08,603
What happened at 21?

506
00:25:08,605 --> 00:25:13,375
You asked me if I'd had enough
experience with men before I got married,

507
00:25:13,377 --> 00:25:16,378
and I thought that was actually
an insulting question,

508
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,380
and I got very angry,

509
00:25:18,382 --> 00:25:21,449
and we actually stopped
filming because of it.

510
00:25:21,451 --> 00:25:23,952
And if you look
at the tapes of me at 21,

511
00:25:23,954 --> 00:25:26,922
I am sitting, and to all
intents and purposes

512
00:25:26,924 --> 00:25:29,525
I might as well
have not been there.

513
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:32,360
But I was really angry

514
00:25:32,362 --> 00:25:34,896
that you even thought
you could get -

515
00:25:34,898 --> 00:25:39,834
You wouldn't have asked some of the
other people in this program that question.

516
00:25:39,836 --> 00:25:43,972
You will edit this program
as you see fit.

517
00:25:43,974 --> 00:25:46,809
I've got no control over that.

518
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:49,778
You definitely come across
as this is your idea

519
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:53,148
of what you want to do
and how you see us,

520
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:56,185
and that's how you portray us.

521
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:59,421
This one may be - may be the
first one that's about us

522
00:25:59,423 --> 00:26:01,624
rather than about
your perception of us.

523
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:04,593
So how up to now
have I got you wrong?

524
00:26:04,595 --> 00:26:07,095
How have you got me wrong?

525
00:26:07,097 --> 00:26:11,533
The last one was very much
based on... The sympathy

526
00:26:11,535 --> 00:26:14,369
and-and the illness that I've got

527
00:26:14,371 --> 00:26:18,640
and what I may or may
not be able to do.

528
00:26:18,642 --> 00:26:21,877
It should have been
about what I can do,

529
00:26:21,879 --> 00:26:25,848
what I am doing,
what-what I will do.

530
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,716
Don't make that mistake, Mike.

531
00:26:27,718 --> 00:26:29,918
I am no way - I am -

532
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,421
I am down and I am depressed
about my illness,

533
00:26:32,423 --> 00:26:35,090
but I'm certainly not down
and depressed about my life.

534
00:26:35,092 --> 00:26:37,092
And there are
a lot of the times

535
00:26:37,094 --> 00:26:39,828
that I sit and I cringe
when I watch those programs,

536
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:43,231
not just for me,
but for other people.

537
00:26:43,233 --> 00:26:46,768
You can ask me about Ian,
and you know full well

538
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:50,672
I'm going to say to you it's none of
your business, I'm not talking about it.

539
00:26:50,674 --> 00:26:53,375
Now, there are people in this
program that don't do that,

540
00:26:53,377 --> 00:26:55,544
that, quite of their own free will,

541
00:26:55,546 --> 00:26:57,546
will talk about their marriages

542
00:26:57,548 --> 00:26:59,848
or their divorces
or the state of their lives,

543
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:02,417
but I don't think
you should be into that.

544
00:27:02,419 --> 00:27:05,387
I don't think you should
even be asking that.

545
00:27:05,389 --> 00:27:07,388
It's part of people's lives,

546
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:09,457
and this program is
about people's lives.

547
00:27:09,459 --> 00:27:10,959
Yeah, but that's -

548
00:27:10,961 --> 00:27:12,961
See, to me, that's
a part of my life

549
00:27:12,963 --> 00:27:14,796
that will never go
on this program.

550
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:18,400
You know I'd married. My ex-husband
never took part in this.

551
00:27:18,402 --> 00:27:20,936
My partner now will never
take part in this.

552
00:27:20,938 --> 00:27:25,474
But that's not my fault. No, but that's
because that's the way I want it.

553
00:27:25,476 --> 00:27:27,675
But it still doesn't
stop you trying

554
00:27:27,677 --> 00:27:29,844
to get that information from me.

555
00:27:29,846 --> 00:27:32,948
So what would you
like to talk about

556
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:35,216
if you want me to represent you?

557
00:27:35,218 --> 00:27:37,686
We've talked a bit
about the children.

558
00:27:37,688 --> 00:27:39,721
What I want to do.

559
00:27:39,723 --> 00:27:43,592
What I hope to do.

560
00:27:43,594 --> 00:27:47,062
I just don't want
that personal conversation.

561
00:27:47,064 --> 00:27:49,064
OK, well, let's talk about that -

562
00:27:49,066 --> 00:27:52,634
What you hope to do and
what you hope for the boys.

563
00:27:52,636 --> 00:27:55,670
What I hope to do.

564
00:27:55,672 --> 00:27:58,240
I'd, actually -

565
00:27:58,242 --> 00:28:01,609
I'd like to go back to school

566
00:28:01,611 --> 00:28:06,448
so that I can hold a conversation
with anybody in the world

567
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:08,449
and know what I'm talking about.

568
00:28:08,451 --> 00:28:10,351
So that I'm not stuck -

569
00:28:10,353 --> 00:28:13,355
"I know a little bit about that,
but I don't really know enough."

570
00:28:13,357 --> 00:28:15,224
I'd love to know...

571
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:19,394
Actually, I'd really love to start
my education all over again.

572
00:28:19,396 --> 00:28:21,830
My mum, 'cause she got five girls,

573
00:28:21,832 --> 00:28:24,900
she had seven -
um, seven years' bad luck.

574
00:28:24,902 --> 00:28:27,168
That's why she's got five girls.

575
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:31,005
I'd like to be able
to have a happy family.

576
00:28:31,007 --> 00:28:34,342
I mean, I know that it's not possible
to be happy all the time,

577
00:28:34,344 --> 00:28:37,012
but as much of the time
that it was possible.

578
00:28:37,014 --> 00:28:38,813
I don't know what Suzy's had.

579
00:28:38,815 --> 00:28:41,716
What's Suzy had that I haven't had?
I mean, until I know that...

580
00:28:41,718 --> 00:28:44,419
(Michael) Are you different
from what I should have expected

581
00:28:44,421 --> 00:28:46,221
at 7 and 14 and 21?

582
00:28:46,223 --> 00:28:49,724
Maybe not enough, but I've got it.

583
00:28:49,726 --> 00:28:53,261
I think I'm actually more intelligent
than you thought I would be.

584
00:28:53,263 --> 00:29:00,035
I have reached a level,
um... in my life

585
00:29:00,037 --> 00:29:02,037
that I'm happy with,

586
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:05,974
and I enjoy doing - being -
I enjoy being me,

587
00:29:05,976 --> 00:29:08,977
but I don't think you
ever really expected me

588
00:29:08,979 --> 00:29:11,713
to turn out the way I have.

589
00:29:11,715 --> 00:29:13,715
How was that, Lee?
Great!

590
00:29:13,717 --> 00:29:16,618
(laughing, indistinct)

591
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:19,621
If we did all love Geoffrey

592
00:29:19,623 --> 00:29:21,623
and we all want to marry him,

593
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:26,261
I think I know the one that
he likes best, and that's her.

594
00:29:26,263 --> 00:29:31,166
I don't think I'd...
Get married too early.

595
00:29:31,168 --> 00:29:33,502
I'd like to have
a full life first, and...

596
00:29:33,504 --> 00:29:35,504
I'd like to enjoy myself
before I -

597
00:29:35,506 --> 00:29:38,840
Yeah, before you can commit
yourself to a family.

598
00:29:38,842 --> 00:29:41,342
Marriage means a different thing
to me. I've still got my ideals.

599
00:29:41,344 --> 00:29:43,178
I don't know
what it's all about.

600
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,547
Sue was 24 when she married Billy.

601
00:29:45,549 --> 00:29:49,083
They had two children -
William and Catherine.

602
00:29:49,085 --> 00:29:51,086
I think that to
get married young

603
00:29:51,088 --> 00:29:53,087
there must be things
that you miss.

604
00:29:53,089 --> 00:29:56,691
You must miss that crucial
stage of being yourself,

605
00:29:56,693 --> 00:29:58,526
because the minute you get married,

606
00:29:58,528 --> 00:30:01,229
you're no longer a single being.

607
00:30:01,231 --> 00:30:03,965
You're a partnership, and that
should be the idea behind it.

608
00:30:03,967 --> 00:30:09,504
By the time she was 35,
she and Billy had divorced.

609
00:30:09,506 --> 00:30:12,507
I've never sat down and thought,
well, what was it?

610
00:30:12,509 --> 00:30:14,510
Was it this, was it that?

611
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:18,080
I just knew it wasn't working.

612
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:21,082
There have been relationships
when I could have settled,

613
00:30:21,084 --> 00:30:23,084
but they didn't feel quite right,

614
00:30:23,086 --> 00:30:27,089
so I've always come
away and pulled away

615
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:31,393
and just waited until
the right one come along,

616
00:30:31,395 --> 00:30:33,194
if they ever do.

617
00:30:33,196 --> 00:30:38,367
¶ Don't you remember you told
me you loved me, baby?

618
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:42,471
At 42, when we filmed Sue
in the karaoke bar,

619
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:45,206
she brought Glen along
to watch her sing.

620
00:30:45,208 --> 00:30:48,110
¶ ...Baby, baby,
baby, oh, baby

621
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:50,812
We've just met and
things are going well,

622
00:30:50,814 --> 00:30:53,849
but now obviously things
have gone very well.

623
00:30:53,851 --> 00:30:56,785
(Michael) Is this love?

624
00:30:56,787 --> 00:30:58,653
Oh, I think so, yeah.

625
00:30:58,655 --> 00:31:02,257
We've known each other for a long,
long time before the seven years,

626
00:31:02,259 --> 00:31:05,593
and we've always,
always liked each other.

627
00:31:05,595 --> 00:31:07,896
He's good looking.

628
00:31:07,898 --> 00:31:09,864
He's very good looking.
He's not bad, is he?

629
00:31:09,866 --> 00:31:13,835
Everyone says he looks
like... Paul Weller.

630
00:31:13,837 --> 00:31:16,337
Whether that's true or not,
especially now he's growing his hair.

631
00:31:16,339 --> 00:31:21,710
(Jackie) Susan most of all
likes Lesley. Do I?

632
00:31:21,712 --> 00:31:24,379
She keeps changing
her mind, though.

633
00:31:24,381 --> 00:31:26,781
Yeah. I don't know
which one, really.

634
00:31:26,783 --> 00:31:29,084
Everything's not
that cut and dried.

635
00:31:29,086 --> 00:31:31,552
It's not either a career
or family or -

636
00:31:31,554 --> 00:31:33,555
But it's what's in the middle.

637
00:31:33,557 --> 00:31:36,224
Am I just going to carry
on as I am now for -

638
00:31:36,226 --> 00:31:38,426
And end up on a shelf,

639
00:31:38,428 --> 00:31:41,396
or am I just going to get
married, could be any day?

640
00:31:41,398 --> 00:31:43,998
I've been married, and I've
not got that urgency.

641
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,601
Glen - we sort of
say maybe we will.

642
00:31:46,603 --> 00:31:49,104
We're engaged, you know,
we're committed.

643
00:31:49,106 --> 00:31:53,342
We've bought a house together,
and to me, that's a big commitment.

644
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:56,812
Every house needs money spending
on it when you move in.

645
00:31:56,814 --> 00:31:59,781
To have a wedding, you gotta
put some cash into it.

646
00:31:59,783 --> 00:32:01,282
When I got married,

647
00:32:01,284 --> 00:32:04,385
the primary reason was because
I wanted to have a child.

648
00:32:04,387 --> 00:32:06,921
The two, to me, went together.

649
00:32:06,923 --> 00:32:10,391
Have you and Glen thought
of having your own child?

650
00:32:10,393 --> 00:32:12,427
Well, Glen got with me when -

651
00:32:12,429 --> 00:32:16,164
We got together, I should say,
when I was in my 40's,

652
00:32:16,166 --> 00:32:19,534
and you don't have a baby when
you've just started a relationship.

653
00:32:19,536 --> 00:32:21,703
I didn't want to
do all that again.

654
00:32:21,705 --> 00:32:24,472
I would have loved to
have had a baby with him,

655
00:32:24,474 --> 00:32:26,475
because he would make
a wonderful parent,

656
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:28,843
but the timing was off.

657
00:32:28,845 --> 00:32:32,047
So she's your baby?

658
00:32:32,049 --> 00:32:33,815
She's my new baby, yeah.

659
00:32:33,817 --> 00:32:36,851
Yeah, my kids are my babies,
but she's my new baby.

660
00:32:36,853 --> 00:32:40,421
She's our baby, mine and Glen's.

661
00:32:43,325 --> 00:32:46,227
She's a wonderful terrier.
She's got such character.

662
00:32:46,229 --> 00:32:47,895
What does she do?

663
00:32:47,897 --> 00:32:51,099
Well, she watches TV with us.

664
00:32:51,101 --> 00:32:53,368
She's got her own
favourite programs.

665
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:57,105
And she adores Rolf Harris,

666
00:32:57,107 --> 00:32:59,875
absolutely adores Animal Hospital.

667
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:03,278
She's at the top of the house,
and the music comes on,

668
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,547
she runs down the stairs and
puts herself in front of the TV

669
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:10,451
for Rolf Harris.

670
00:33:10,453 --> 00:33:13,021
So, the house looks nice.
You pleased with it?

671
00:33:13,023 --> 00:33:16,658
I am very pleased with it.
It's a lovely step for us.

672
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:19,193
We feel like we've got
more space around us,

673
00:33:19,195 --> 00:33:22,530
and we've got to do
everything inside,

674
00:33:22,532 --> 00:33:25,066
but we can build on it,
and that's what we want.

675
00:33:25,068 --> 00:33:28,069
I've been promising to have a
housewarming party since we've moved in.

676
00:33:28,071 --> 00:33:29,905
We've been here four months now,

677
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:32,173
so I thought it was
about time we did that.

678
00:33:32,175 --> 00:33:34,342
So people are just
starting to arrive now.

679
00:33:34,344 --> 00:33:38,212
So, you left the East End. Why?

680
00:33:38,214 --> 00:33:41,616
Well, I've always
wanted to move out,

681
00:33:41,618 --> 00:33:44,686
but you don't do that, or
the opportunity isn't there,

682
00:33:44,688 --> 00:33:48,089
when you are own your
own with two kids.

683
00:33:48,091 --> 00:33:51,459
I wish I had done it before.
It's timing, you know.

684
00:33:51,461 --> 00:33:53,428
Now was the right time, obviously.

685
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:55,931
The East End has changed.
It's changed a lot.

686
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:58,967
He was even playing
"tie the tooth."

687
00:33:58,969 --> 00:34:01,635
Mum comes down to me.
It's so easy for them.

688
00:34:01,637 --> 00:34:05,740
They can jump on a train, and, you know,
the station's within walking distance,

689
00:34:05,742 --> 00:34:09,611
so it's worked out
wonderfully well.

690
00:34:09,613 --> 00:34:12,314
Some people are just born into
rich families, and they're lucky.

691
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:14,482
I don't see why they
should have the luck,

692
00:34:14,484 --> 00:34:16,485
when people have worked
all their lives

693
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:18,720
and haven't got half as
much as what they have,

694
00:34:18,722 --> 00:34:20,555
it just don't seem fair.

695
00:34:20,557 --> 00:34:23,492
(Michael) So have you
moved up a class now?

696
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:26,761
That's difficult to say.

697
00:34:26,763 --> 00:34:28,830
Up a class.

698
00:34:28,832 --> 00:34:31,966
Um, I suppose it feels
like that to me.

699
00:34:31,968 --> 00:34:33,968
No, there ain't
no need for food...

700
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:36,571
Now you've got the sense of pride,
you've got your own house.

701
00:34:36,573 --> 00:34:39,507
I feel like I'm building
for the future.

702
00:34:39,509 --> 00:34:41,542
(laughs)

703
00:34:41,544 --> 00:34:44,812
I've been a single parent
for a long while.

704
00:34:44,814 --> 00:34:47,248
I've brought them up
on my own, really,

705
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:50,885
because Catherine was
only two when Bill left.

706
00:34:50,887 --> 00:34:52,687
It's been extremely hard

707
00:34:52,689 --> 00:34:56,357
and it's been - sometimes
it's been very lonely.

708
00:34:56,359 --> 00:34:58,359
I only had to have
one filling, right.

709
00:34:58,361 --> 00:35:00,528
That was about the only
thing that I had done.

710
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:03,164
William's - he's a computer addict.

711
00:35:03,166 --> 00:35:04,965
He works in the industry

712
00:35:04,967 --> 00:35:08,537
and he also constantly
has a computer on indoors.

713
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:12,239
He-he could have
gone to university,

714
00:35:12,241 --> 00:35:14,442
and he knows that and I know that,

715
00:35:14,444 --> 00:35:17,512
and I do regret that for him.

716
00:35:17,514 --> 00:35:19,114
But I've been there.

717
00:35:19,116 --> 00:35:23,118
I can just remember I didn't
want to do that, either.

718
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:26,454
And Catherine's temping

719
00:35:26,456 --> 00:35:28,757
because she wants to do a
bit of traveling next year.

720
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:32,693
People say she's me reincarnated.

721
00:35:32,695 --> 00:35:35,697
I mean, she looks a bit like me

722
00:35:35,699 --> 00:35:37,899
and her mannerisms
are exactly like me,

723
00:35:37,901 --> 00:35:42,336
and she likes to enjoy herself.

724
00:35:42,338 --> 00:35:45,673
To walk into a relationship

725
00:35:45,675 --> 00:35:48,409
with someone who's
got two teenagers -

726
00:35:48,411 --> 00:35:50,912
It must have been
very difficult for him,

727
00:35:50,914 --> 00:35:53,381
and they do clash occasionally.

728
00:35:53,383 --> 00:35:55,282
I absolutely hate it,

729
00:35:55,284 --> 00:35:57,719
because I'm just
an easy-going person

730
00:35:57,721 --> 00:36:00,555
and I don't like strife.

731
00:36:00,557 --> 00:36:03,258
They are doing things
the way I've brought them up,

732
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:06,261
which isn't the way that Glen
would like things to be done,

733
00:36:06,263 --> 00:36:10,565
so you've got to learn to live
together in the same house.

734
00:36:10,567 --> 00:36:14,068
It will always be a learning curve.

735
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,837
I'm a peacemaker.

736
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:19,007
When the children were
old enough to go to school,

737
00:36:19,009 --> 00:36:22,610
Sue went back to work and
had a series of office jobs.

738
00:36:22,612 --> 00:36:24,745
She now helps run the MA courses

739
00:36:24,747 --> 00:36:28,116
in the legal faculty of
the university of London.

740
00:36:28,118 --> 00:36:32,520
Still work for the college,
but we moved to central London.

741
00:36:32,522 --> 00:36:37,959
Now I am sort of the main
administrator for the program

742
00:36:37,961 --> 00:36:39,794
instead of an assistant, you know,

743
00:36:39,796 --> 00:36:42,530
and I've got a couple of people
that help me with that.

744
00:36:42,532 --> 00:36:46,735
Could you fax that to Mary
for me, please? Thanks.

745
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:48,570
So you like the responsibility?

746
00:36:48,572 --> 00:36:50,405
Yeah, I love the responsibility.

747
00:36:50,407 --> 00:36:54,275
I think I was born for the
responsibility. Yeah, I love it.

748
00:36:54,277 --> 00:36:55,610
Well, I've never been abroad, but -

749
00:36:55,612 --> 00:36:57,812
No, nor have I.
I have.

750
00:36:57,814 --> 00:37:00,314
Oh, yeah, 'cause you went on
that cruise, didn't you? Yeah.

751
00:37:00,316 --> 00:37:03,551
Once a year we go
to Cornwall or Devon.

752
00:37:03,553 --> 00:37:06,154
We try to find a
different spot every year,

753
00:37:06,156 --> 00:37:08,222
and we just bring the dog.

754
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:10,224
It's just such a lovely place.

755
00:37:10,226 --> 00:37:12,694
Every time you turn a corner,
there's a different sight,

756
00:37:12,696 --> 00:37:14,396
there's a different -

757
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,030
You just never know
what you're going to find.

758
00:37:16,032 --> 00:37:21,202
Everything's just so beautiful.

759
00:37:21,204 --> 00:37:25,807
We'd both had childhood holidays
here and good memories,

760
00:37:25,809 --> 00:37:27,809
and we decided to come back,

761
00:37:27,811 --> 00:37:29,577
and we've been coming ever since.

762
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:33,314
It's nice for us just to
be a couple for a week.

763
00:37:35,217 --> 00:37:38,219
When we retire, or maybe
before, if we get lucky,

764
00:37:38,221 --> 00:37:40,955
then this is the sort of
place we'd like to come to.

765
00:37:40,957 --> 00:37:44,392
That little one there, right in
the middle nearest the beach -

766
00:37:44,394 --> 00:37:48,196
That would be ideal, absolute
perfect - the perfect place.

767
00:37:48,198 --> 00:37:50,265
(laughs)

768
00:37:51,734 --> 00:37:53,835
Oh, that was good.

769
00:37:55,371 --> 00:37:59,441
Vesto, vestas, vest...

770
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:00,575
Vestat.

771
00:38:00,577 --> 00:38:03,444
Vestamus, vestatis, vestant.

772
00:38:03,446 --> 00:38:05,312
(man) Here, speak up.

773
00:38:05,314 --> 00:38:07,315
Fill out the gaps
on the board there.

774
00:38:07,317 --> 00:38:10,851
When he was seven, Bruce was at
a preparatory boarding school.

775
00:38:10,853 --> 00:38:14,288
At 14, St. Paul's in London.

776
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:17,726
They don't sort of enforce
being upper class

777
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:19,727
and things like that

778
00:38:19,729 --> 00:38:21,762
at St. Paul's, you know.

779
00:38:21,764 --> 00:38:26,067
They suggest that you don't have
long hair, and they do get it cut if,

780
00:38:26,069 --> 00:38:30,538
and they teach you to be
reasonably well mannered

781
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:34,108
but not to sniff on
the poorer people.

782
00:38:35,744 --> 00:38:40,815
At 21, he was in his last year
at Oxford, reading maths.

783
00:38:40,817 --> 00:38:43,885
You can show that
this is irreducible.

784
00:38:43,887 --> 00:38:48,022
Then you do a transformation on this
polynomial - x equal to t plus 2.

785
00:38:48,024 --> 00:38:50,024
Good. That's a nice
way of doing it,

786
00:38:50,026 --> 00:38:52,326
particularly using
Eisenstein down here.

787
00:38:52,328 --> 00:38:54,529
His test is very powerful.

788
00:38:54,531 --> 00:38:56,531
(Bruce calling children's names)
Yes, sir!

789
00:38:56,533 --> 00:38:59,901
At 28, Bruce was teaching maths

790
00:38:59,903 --> 00:39:01,135
in east London.

791
00:39:01,137 --> 00:39:03,838
Well, I'll go into Africa

792
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:08,209
and try and teach people
who are not civilized

793
00:39:08,211 --> 00:39:11,846
to be more or less good.

794
00:39:14,917 --> 00:39:21,356
At 35, he was teaching in Silet
in northern Bangladesh.

795
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:25,459
And I also got the chance to learn a
bit of Bangla, which is very difficult.

796
00:39:25,461 --> 00:39:26,860
Not doing very well at.

797
00:39:26,862 --> 00:39:30,064
(instructor) Bangladesh,
Bangladesh. Bangladesh.

798
00:39:30,066 --> 00:39:31,132
Bangladesh.

799
00:39:31,134 --> 00:39:33,201
Bangladesh.
Bangladesh.

800
00:39:33,203 --> 00:39:35,770
Before you do anything,
you have to make sure...

801
00:39:35,772 --> 00:39:39,240
By 42, Bruce was back
in the East End

802
00:39:39,242 --> 00:39:41,242
running the maths department
at a girls' school.

803
00:39:41,244 --> 00:39:44,378
After naught hours you can see
that it would be 60 litres.

804
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:47,848
OK, now you want to put this
information... (¶ choir singing)

805
00:40:02,097 --> 00:40:05,099
At 49, he's teaching at St. Albans,

806
00:40:05,101 --> 00:40:07,635
a large boys' independent school

807
00:40:07,637 --> 00:40:09,970
which has girls in the sixth form.

808
00:40:09,972 --> 00:40:12,406
I sing in the choir.
That happens twice a week.

809
00:40:12,408 --> 00:40:15,176
On Mondays and Fridays
we go to the abbey,

810
00:40:15,178 --> 00:40:18,413
because in the early days,
the school was in the abbey,

811
00:40:18,415 --> 00:40:21,181
going back to 948.

812
00:40:21,183 --> 00:40:23,117
(Michael) 948?

813
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,586
Yes, so the head
quite likes to say

814
00:40:25,588 --> 00:40:28,355
we're in our third
millennium, you know.

815
00:40:28,357 --> 00:40:30,958
So the school's over
a thousand years old?

816
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,860
Yes, in one form or another.

817
00:40:32,862 --> 00:40:35,696
You have to make x
the subject of this equation,

818
00:40:35,698 --> 00:40:37,698
so what's the first thing we do?

819
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,467
Multiply both sides by three.
You don't multiply...

820
00:40:39,469 --> 00:40:41,869
Divide. Sorry. Divide by three.

821
00:40:41,871 --> 00:40:44,938
(Michael) Tell me, then, what's
exciting about teaching here for you.

822
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:49,376
There is a higher
academic level to teach,

823
00:40:49,378 --> 00:40:52,347
and then you can see pupils
at a more developed level,

824
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:54,182
that flash of recognition

825
00:40:54,184 --> 00:40:57,218
and then engendering
their love of the subject

826
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:00,521
that I had at their age.

827
00:41:00,523 --> 00:41:02,356
There is a class society,

828
00:41:02,358 --> 00:41:07,828
and I think public schools
may help its continuance.

829
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:10,264
So you're in the lead,
you see, because...

830
00:41:10,266 --> 00:41:12,834
has it been a kind of compromise

831
00:41:12,836 --> 00:41:15,570
of political principles
for you - this?

832
00:41:15,572 --> 00:41:17,605
Well, I would say, you know,

833
00:41:17,607 --> 00:41:20,074
have a million angels
in front of every teacher

834
00:41:20,076 --> 00:41:22,977
who's prepared to slog away
at an inner-city comprehensive.

835
00:41:22,979 --> 00:41:24,445
"Make way, make way.

836
00:41:24,447 --> 00:41:27,114
"This is somebody who's prepared
to turn up each day

837
00:41:27,116 --> 00:41:28,683
and do that job."

838
00:41:28,685 --> 00:41:30,852
(Paul) Where's the graph?
(girl) 60?

839
00:41:30,854 --> 00:41:32,086
60, right.

840
00:41:32,088 --> 00:41:34,722
So when the tank is full
after naught hours...

841
00:41:34,724 --> 00:41:37,758
That motto "Water
weareth away a stone

842
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,128
by dripping upon it,
not by smashing it"

843
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:44,365
was, as a motto for teaching,
that you kept on teaching them,

844
00:41:44,367 --> 00:41:46,867
and that eventually
it would get through,

845
00:41:46,869 --> 00:41:51,272
and the pupils would change
and learn and develop and so on.

846
00:41:51,274 --> 00:41:54,141
But I think in the end
the reverse happened.

847
00:41:54,143 --> 00:41:58,179
That water dripping
on me wore me away.

848
00:41:58,181 --> 00:42:02,983
I just thought, "I don't think
I can do this till I'm 60,

849
00:42:02,985 --> 00:42:06,321
and therefore I'll have
to do something else."

850
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:10,758
Do your old friends give you a
hard time about what you've done?

851
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,760
They certainly do.
They absolutely do.

852
00:42:12,762 --> 00:42:16,897
They say, oh, you know, "Have we joined
the tory party, the golf club, the masons?"

853
00:42:16,899 --> 00:42:23,837
"You're driving a much better car
than you used to" and so on.

854
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:28,109
Well, my girlfriend is in Africa,

855
00:42:28,111 --> 00:42:32,846
And I won't - I don't think I'll have
another chance of seeing her again.

856
00:42:32,848 --> 00:42:34,482
Have you got any girlfriends?

857
00:42:34,484 --> 00:42:36,950
No, no, not yet.

858
00:42:36,952 --> 00:42:40,054
I'm sure it will come, but not yet.

859
00:42:40,056 --> 00:42:44,926
I mean, I do think a lot of
people think too much about it.

860
00:42:44,928 --> 00:42:49,264
I think I would very
much like to, um...

861
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,435
...Oh, become involved in a family
- my own family, for a start.

862
00:42:54,437 --> 00:42:58,139
That's a need that I feel
I ought to fulfil

863
00:42:58,141 --> 00:43:00,641
and would like to fulfil
and would do it well.

864
00:43:00,643 --> 00:43:02,644
Yes, I haven't got
married or whatever,

865
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:04,645
and I was supposing, you know, that

866
00:43:04,647 --> 00:43:07,482
that would have been something
which I hoped had happened.

867
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:10,317
(Michael) You're getting on a bit.
Are you getting worried?

868
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:13,020
Well, not particularly.
I mean, I'm always optimistic.

869
00:43:13,022 --> 00:43:15,456
I mean, who knows who
I might meet tomorrow?

870
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:17,458
And in the middle
of a conversation

871
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:20,761
about something
completely different,

872
00:43:20,763 --> 00:43:24,965
he just asked if, um,
if I'd like to marry him,

873
00:43:24,967 --> 00:43:27,001
and if I hadn't been
listening carefully,

874
00:43:27,003 --> 00:43:29,002
I would have missed it completely.

875
00:43:29,004 --> 00:43:30,704
To love and to cherish.

876
00:43:30,706 --> 00:43:32,006
To love and to cherish.

877
00:43:32,008 --> 00:43:34,041
Till death us do part.

878
00:43:34,043 --> 00:43:36,010
Till death us do part.

879
00:43:36,012 --> 00:43:38,045
Is this a beetroot or something?

880
00:43:38,047 --> 00:43:40,047
I think it's just a weed.

881
00:43:40,049 --> 00:43:41,815
Do you enjoy gardening?

882
00:43:41,817 --> 00:43:44,585
Well, under Penny's
directions, you know,

883
00:43:44,587 --> 00:43:46,687
I do whatever she asks me.

884
00:43:46,689 --> 00:43:49,057
I don't know what to do here,

885
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:51,358
what order to do things in.

886
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:54,262
She and her mother
are quite good at this.

887
00:43:54,264 --> 00:43:55,863
So you're the labourer?

888
00:43:55,865 --> 00:43:58,766
Yes, I'm the unpaid labourer,

889
00:43:58,768 --> 00:44:00,734
the serf,

890
00:44:00,736 --> 00:44:03,738
the feudal vassal or whatever.

891
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:07,808
Well, Penny will give you
the correct medieval terms.

892
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:10,411
We don't argue very much.
Not really.

893
00:44:10,413 --> 00:44:13,747
I mean, we haven't really had
a sort of full-blown row.

894
00:44:13,749 --> 00:44:17,384
No, our arguments sort of
tend to be two sentences,

895
00:44:17,386 --> 00:44:20,021
and I go off and sulk for 24 hours.

896
00:44:20,023 --> 00:44:22,256
How are you doing, dear?
Fine.

897
00:44:22,258 --> 00:44:24,558
And I think the one
positive influence on him -

898
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,393
I've stopped him apologizing.

899
00:44:26,395 --> 00:44:29,430
When I first knew him, he
kept saying, "Sorry, sorry,"

900
00:44:29,432 --> 00:44:31,499
and apologized for
all sorts of things

901
00:44:31,501 --> 00:44:34,335
that there was no need
to apologize for.

902
00:44:34,337 --> 00:44:36,404
Maybe it's just 'cause
we weren't married then.

903
00:44:36,406 --> 00:44:39,673
Yeah, see, I was winning you over.
Yeah, that's right.

904
00:44:39,675 --> 00:44:43,076
You're the world's greatest cook.
It's only pasta...

905
00:44:43,078 --> 00:44:46,814
But if you have emotional issues,
will you talk about them?

906
00:44:46,816 --> 00:44:50,218
Mm. Well, I have
the usual male reticence

907
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,652
about that kind of thing,
you know.

908
00:44:51,654 --> 00:44:53,187
Great tea.

909
00:44:53,189 --> 00:44:55,923
If Penny really wanted
to give me a hard time,

910
00:44:55,925 --> 00:44:58,492
she'd have to say,
"Talk about your feelings."

911
00:44:58,494 --> 00:44:59,993
That would be about -

912
00:44:59,995 --> 00:45:03,831
That would be worse than
a 24-hour sulk, you know.

913
00:45:03,833 --> 00:45:06,033
I think so, yeah.
I don't know whether...

914
00:45:06,035 --> 00:45:08,035
(Bruce) We may have children.
I don't know.

915
00:45:08,037 --> 00:45:10,904
I mean, if in seven
years' time or so

916
00:45:10,906 --> 00:45:14,741
we're living in a slightly bigger
house with a young family,

917
00:45:14,743 --> 00:45:16,510
that would be nice.

918
00:45:16,512 --> 00:45:20,914
I mean, I don't want to pin all
my hopes on it and nothing happens.

919
00:45:20,916 --> 00:45:22,649
We are quite old.

920
00:45:22,651 --> 00:45:25,553
I can seeing bringing up, say,
teenage children in your 50's

921
00:45:25,555 --> 00:45:27,921
might be a bit strange.

922
00:45:27,923 --> 00:45:31,859
Come on, then, Henry.
Get on.

923
00:45:31,861 --> 00:45:33,427
(boys laughing)

924
00:45:33,429 --> 00:45:35,596
(Michael) Is it more
tiring than you thought?

925
00:45:35,598 --> 00:45:38,299
(Penny) I don't think
until you're doing it

926
00:45:38,301 --> 00:45:40,301
you realize how
sleep-deprived you get

927
00:45:40,303 --> 00:45:42,303
and how totally
exhausted you are

928
00:45:42,305 --> 00:45:44,538
all the time for several years.

929
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:46,540
I think that came
as rather a shock.

930
00:45:46,542 --> 00:45:49,776
Sometimes I go to bed at 8:30,
which is ridiculous.

931
00:45:49,778 --> 00:45:53,447
In fact, I sometimes go to bed
before Henry and George.

932
00:45:53,449 --> 00:45:56,717
He looks like his father,
doesn't he?

933
00:45:56,719 --> 00:46:00,555
Um, George has got the cheekbones

934
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:03,257
that run in Bruce's family.

935
00:46:03,259 --> 00:46:05,626
And what have I got?

936
00:46:05,628 --> 00:46:08,162
Uh...

937
00:46:08,164 --> 00:46:11,766
Ooh, that's hard
to answer, darling.

938
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:14,835
(yelling commands)

939
00:46:14,837 --> 00:46:20,875
We're at my first school, where
I was from about five to eight,

940
00:46:20,877 --> 00:46:23,978
and this is where I
boarded for three years.

941
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:26,313
Squad, March...

942
00:46:26,315 --> 00:46:28,416
I can remember being happy there.

943
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:31,084
I can remember also being miserable

944
00:46:31,086 --> 00:46:33,187
because I can remember crying.

945
00:46:33,189 --> 00:46:34,888
Squad, steady!

946
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:38,492
I always seemed to be beaten,
and I never used to understand why.

947
00:46:38,494 --> 00:46:39,694
Squad, halt!

948
00:46:39,696 --> 00:46:42,028
(Michael) You were
here because, what -

949
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:47,935
Your parents were...? My parents
were separated and were divorced.

950
00:46:47,937 --> 00:46:52,673
And just to give me a stable
place to be and be educated,

951
00:46:52,675 --> 00:46:57,378
it was a solution
to all those problems.

952
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:00,781
My heart's desire
is to see my daddy,

953
00:47:00,783 --> 00:47:03,183
who is 6,000 miles away.

954
00:47:03,185 --> 00:47:06,887
I did miss contact
with my father, and...

955
00:47:06,889 --> 00:47:09,891
Well, I say it as a joke
to Penny, you know,

956
00:47:09,893 --> 00:47:12,560
"Time to send them
boarding as I was",

957
00:47:12,562 --> 00:47:15,328
And she says, "Over my
dead body", which is -

958
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:17,765
But I wouldn't want that, either.

959
00:47:17,767 --> 00:47:21,268
Five years ago the family
moved away from the East End

960
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:23,771
to be near Bruce's new school.

961
00:47:23,773 --> 00:47:25,773
It's very quiet,
its child-friendly,

962
00:47:25,775 --> 00:47:27,775
and it just feels very safe.

963
00:47:27,777 --> 00:47:30,644
That's really important when
you've got small children -

964
00:47:30,646 --> 00:47:33,514
That the area feels safe.

965
00:47:33,516 --> 00:47:36,583
(¶ piano, percussion)

966
00:47:36,585 --> 00:47:39,753
I mean, what can you give
them that you didn't have?

967
00:47:39,755 --> 00:47:42,957
Contact with a father
that is loving,

968
00:47:42,959 --> 00:47:45,859
and they can realize that

969
00:47:45,861 --> 00:47:49,430
and show that love
to other people

970
00:47:49,432 --> 00:47:53,834
and realize when they're letting
both themselves and me down.

971
00:47:53,836 --> 00:47:57,137
That could be a sort of
guiding light for them.

972
00:47:57,139 --> 00:48:00,607
Do you want any more children?

973
00:48:00,609 --> 00:48:02,543
Well...

974
00:48:02,545 --> 00:48:06,347
Bruce was originally talking
about a cricket team.

975
00:48:06,349 --> 00:48:09,283
He's got his opening batsman,

976
00:48:09,285 --> 00:48:12,486
and that I think is going
to be his lot, frankly.

977
00:48:12,488 --> 00:48:14,321
I want you to play tomorrow.

978
00:48:14,323 --> 00:48:16,990
I'm not gonna drop you
from sarcasm, all right?

979
00:48:16,992 --> 00:48:21,161
I run one of the junior
teams here, the under-13's.

980
00:48:21,163 --> 00:48:24,965
And there'll be nearly 200 boys
there doing that on a Saturday

981
00:48:24,967 --> 00:48:28,035
rather than other things
that could waylay them.

982
00:48:28,037 --> 00:48:30,971
It's that combination
of playing within a team

983
00:48:30,973 --> 00:48:34,976
and the ability to back each
other up and form friendships

984
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:37,978
that's such a nice thing.

985
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:40,514
(clapping)
(man) Nice shot.

986
00:48:40,516 --> 00:48:43,784
At weekends, Bruce
plays village cricket.

987
00:48:43,786 --> 00:48:46,120
We don't really mind
who wins and loses,

988
00:48:46,122 --> 00:48:48,322
we obviously prefer
to win, and, you know,

989
00:48:48,324 --> 00:48:52,359
we go on tour every year,
so we go down to Devon.

990
00:48:52,361 --> 00:48:54,428
You know, ever such
a nice bunch of mates,

991
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:55,996
and I've known some
of them for 25 years.

992
00:48:55,998 --> 00:49:00,834
You can play at a reasonable
level till you're in your 60's.

993
00:49:00,836 --> 00:49:02,803
(Michael) And what about
your batting skills?

994
00:49:02,805 --> 00:49:04,538
I'm mainly a bit of a slogger,

995
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:08,642
so I tend to bat down
the order, 6, 7, 8.

996
00:49:08,644 --> 00:49:13,681
It can be brief, but the last
time I played, I got 50.

997
00:49:13,683 --> 00:49:16,449
Ooh!

998
00:49:16,451 --> 00:49:19,520
Great goin'!

999
00:49:19,522 --> 00:49:21,988
OK, "From their hiding place
in the bushes, William and..."

1000
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:24,358
Do you have fears
for the future?

1001
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:26,260
Personally I've kind of worried

1002
00:49:26,262 --> 00:49:28,262
that the boys will
turn out all right.

1003
00:49:28,264 --> 00:49:29,796
I hope they avoid drugs.

1004
00:49:29,798 --> 00:49:32,299
To see them sleeping

1005
00:49:32,301 --> 00:49:35,535
or carry them around
is just fantastic,

1006
00:49:35,537 --> 00:49:39,439
and just the smell of them
and the look of them is just -

1007
00:49:39,441 --> 00:49:41,442
You just want to protect them

1008
00:49:41,444 --> 00:49:44,644
from everything
that's harmful to them.

1009
00:49:44,646 --> 00:49:50,017
When you look back at yourself
at seven, can we see you now?

1010
00:49:50,019 --> 00:49:52,519
I can't really recognize myself.

1011
00:49:52,521 --> 00:49:54,722
He looks a little bit lost
and a little bit sad,

1012
00:49:54,724 --> 00:49:57,624
and I think I'm
quite sort of surprised

1013
00:49:57,626 --> 00:50:03,030
to be sort of contented
and reasonably happy.

1014
00:50:04,665 --> 00:50:06,633
Do you have a dream?

1015
00:50:06,635 --> 00:50:09,201
Well, I'd have probably liked to
have played international cricket,

1016
00:50:09,203 --> 00:50:12,606
but I just wasn't good enough.

1017
00:50:12,608 --> 00:50:15,308
You know, one's dreams go,
and the day-to-day living

1018
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:19,712
of ordinary life and
family life takes over.

1019
00:50:19,714 --> 00:50:24,149
I think we just sort of
Live without our dreams.

1020
00:50:24,151 --> 00:50:26,586
(laughter)

1021
00:50:28,956 --> 00:50:33,326
I don't like the big
boys hitting us

1022
00:50:33,328 --> 00:50:36,796
and the prefects
sending us out -

1023
00:50:36,798 --> 00:50:38,999
Out for nothing.

1024
00:50:39,001 --> 00:50:41,100
When he was seven,

1025
00:50:41,102 --> 00:50:45,738
Paul was in care in a
children's home in London.

1026
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:48,641
(Michael) Were you happy at
the children's home in England?

1027
00:50:48,643 --> 00:50:52,512
I didn't mind that, really, 'cause
we didn't know what was going on

1028
00:50:52,514 --> 00:50:54,480
'cause we were a bit young.

1029
00:50:54,482 --> 00:50:56,816
Well, as far as I know,
my mother and father -

1030
00:50:56,818 --> 00:51:01,020
Well, they separated
originally, I think.

1031
00:51:01,022 --> 00:51:02,889
They eventually got divorced.

1032
00:51:02,891 --> 00:51:05,058
I went to the boarding school
for one year,

1033
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:07,760
and then we emigrated
to Australia.

1034
00:51:07,762 --> 00:51:10,830
Paul settled with his
father and stepmother

1035
00:51:10,832 --> 00:51:13,165
in a suburb of Melbourne.

1036
00:51:13,167 --> 00:51:15,368
(Michael) What mark
has it left on you -

1037
00:51:15,370 --> 00:51:17,537
The fact that you were brought
up within a bad marriage?

1038
00:51:17,539 --> 00:51:21,508
(Paul) The only thing I can say that
I think might have come from that

1039
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:23,843
is just my lack of confidence

1040
00:51:23,845 --> 00:51:27,446
and being able to show my
feelings, really, I suppose.

1041
00:51:27,448 --> 00:51:30,016
Would you like to
get married, Paul?

1042
00:51:30,018 --> 00:51:31,051
No.

1043
00:51:31,053 --> 00:51:32,318
Tell me why not.

1044
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:35,021
I don't like, um...

1045
00:51:35,023 --> 00:51:38,258
Say you had a wife.

1046
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:43,029
They - they - say you had to
eat what they cooked you,

1047
00:51:43,031 --> 00:51:45,598
and say - I don't like greens.

1048
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,200
Well, I don't.

1049
00:51:47,202 --> 00:51:50,737
Oh, no, I prefer
to be alone, really.

1050
00:51:50,739 --> 00:51:53,606
I can't say I don't want to get
married, 'cause I think I do,

1051
00:51:53,608 --> 00:51:56,108
but I want to be happily
married, you know,

1052
00:51:56,110 --> 00:51:58,611
and therefore I want
to make sure, I think.

1053
00:51:58,613 --> 00:52:01,447
(Michael) What is it that you fell
in love with? What is it about him?

1054
00:52:01,449 --> 00:52:03,716
His helplessness, I suppose.

1055
00:52:03,718 --> 00:52:05,819
It was the motherly instinct in me

1056
00:52:05,821 --> 00:52:07,854
to pick him up and cuddle him.

1057
00:52:07,856 --> 00:52:11,524
And he's also very good looking, I
think, but he doesn't agree with me.

1058
00:52:11,526 --> 00:52:15,729
In the summer he's got this
cute little bum in shorts.

1059
00:52:15,731 --> 00:52:18,364
I mean, I can tell
quite a few stories here,

1060
00:52:18,366 --> 00:52:21,100
but the one that really irritates me
the most is when we have an argument

1061
00:52:21,102 --> 00:52:23,036
he says, "That's it. Leave me."

1062
00:52:23,038 --> 00:52:25,271
And I say, "Fine. All right.
I will one day."

1063
00:52:25,273 --> 00:52:28,441
We had our 20th wedding anniversary
just before Christmas.

1064
00:52:28,443 --> 00:52:30,443
Which is the life sentence.

1065
00:52:30,445 --> 00:52:33,446
Yeah. Everyone reckons that we
should be out of jail by now.

1066
00:52:33,448 --> 00:52:35,448
To a certain extent
we started thinking,

1067
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:37,283
"Well, do we really
know each other now?"

1068
00:52:37,285 --> 00:52:40,319
Because you just
get in the humdrum

1069
00:52:40,321 --> 00:52:43,589
of going to work,
coming back home...

1070
00:52:43,591 --> 00:52:45,991
Running kids here and...
Kids here and there.

1071
00:52:45,993 --> 00:52:50,029
I don't think you mean to, but you probably
stop thinking about each other a lot.

1072
00:52:50,031 --> 00:52:53,099
I find it hard to express
emotion most of the time,

1073
00:52:53,101 --> 00:52:57,603
although I'm getting on top
of that more now, you know.

1074
00:52:57,605 --> 00:52:59,906
Just the simple things,
to say to, sort of,

1075
00:52:59,908 --> 00:53:01,975
"Susan, I love you."
something like that.

1076
00:53:01,977 --> 00:53:05,178
I can tell you about it,

1077
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:10,116
but I really haven't been able
to say it freely to Sue, you know.

1078
00:53:10,118 --> 00:53:12,118
It's a bit hard to talk about.

1079
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,619
I did end up having
to get a bit of help,

1080
00:53:13,621 --> 00:53:16,022
and it wasn't directly due
to our relationship.

1081
00:53:16,024 --> 00:53:18,090
It started at work,
unfortunately,

1082
00:53:18,092 --> 00:53:20,760
which brought my self-esteem down,

1083
00:53:20,762 --> 00:53:23,329
which tended to affect
everything else.

1084
00:53:23,331 --> 00:53:28,001
And I was just very fortunate
that I saw a local doctor

1085
00:53:28,003 --> 00:53:32,605
and with her help, I started coming
back to normal thinking, probably.

1086
00:53:32,607 --> 00:53:38,444
I mean, I was feeling a little bit
worried about the relationship,

1087
00:53:38,446 --> 00:53:41,380
because I felt like I hadn't
progressed. I was going backwards.

1088
00:53:41,382 --> 00:53:44,150
And, I mean, I still believe that.

1089
00:53:44,152 --> 00:53:49,822
I was thinking that why would Susan
want to be with someone as -

1090
00:53:49,824 --> 00:53:51,490
Sounds funny -
but as boring as me,

1091
00:53:51,492 --> 00:53:54,694
'cause there was nothing there.
I mean, what do I do?

1092
00:53:54,696 --> 00:53:57,664
How do I say it?

1093
00:53:57,666 --> 00:54:00,366
It was a shock
that he got that low

1094
00:54:00,368 --> 00:54:01,767
and that he doubted
the relationship,

1095
00:54:01,769 --> 00:54:03,702
because one thing
I've always known is

1096
00:54:03,704 --> 00:54:05,938
that Paul's never doubted
his love for me.

1097
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:07,473
You know, it's always been there,

1098
00:54:07,475 --> 00:54:09,041
and I've never doubted it, either.

1099
00:54:09,043 --> 00:54:12,812
Did the physical side
of your marriage suffer?

1100
00:54:12,814 --> 00:54:14,813
I think it did.

1101
00:54:14,815 --> 00:54:19,151
I think it did, really.
...For a little while.

1102
00:54:19,153 --> 00:54:22,889
We promised ourselves
when we first got married

1103
00:54:22,891 --> 00:54:25,625
that we'd never stop,
you know, touching

1104
00:54:25,627 --> 00:54:27,627
or being affectionate
towards each other.

1105
00:54:27,629 --> 00:54:30,296
And in front of the children,
we've always been -

1106
00:54:30,298 --> 00:54:32,331
And even now with the children,

1107
00:54:32,333 --> 00:54:38,738
we still embrace, a lot, both
Katy and Robert. I mean...

1108
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:42,875
Katy will sometimes say,
"Mother, stop it."

1109
00:54:42,877 --> 00:54:48,414
I was gonna be a policeman, but I
thought how hard it would be to join in.

1110
00:54:48,416 --> 00:54:50,683
I just haven't made up my mind yet.

1111
00:54:50,685 --> 00:54:52,618
I was gonna be a phys ed teacher,

1112
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:54,921
but one of the teachers told me

1113
00:54:54,923 --> 00:54:58,691
that you had to get
up into university.

1114
00:54:58,693 --> 00:55:02,194
At 21, Paul was a junior partner

1115
00:55:02,196 --> 00:55:05,932
in a firm of bricklayers.

1116
00:55:05,934 --> 00:55:09,936
By 28, he'd gone out on
his own as a subcontractor.

1117
00:55:09,938 --> 00:55:13,372
I think when I started
work for myself,

1118
00:55:13,374 --> 00:55:15,841
things were looking good for me,

1119
00:55:15,843 --> 00:55:17,477
'cause I was out of school,

1120
00:55:17,479 --> 00:55:21,680
something I was very
enthusiastic about.

1121
00:55:21,682 --> 00:55:23,983
And I was chasing
the dangling carrot

1122
00:55:23,985 --> 00:55:26,819
but never got there,
'cause, I mean, really,

1123
00:55:26,821 --> 00:55:31,390
I'm a worker and not -
not a businessman.

1124
00:55:31,392 --> 00:55:35,762
By the time he was 42,
Paul was doing factory work,

1125
00:55:35,764 --> 00:55:39,398
making signs for
a plastics company.

1126
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:42,100
What's the future for you
at work, do you think?

1127
00:55:42,102 --> 00:55:44,136
Well, I mean, the job's still there.

1128
00:55:44,138 --> 00:55:47,606
I've had talks with them about whether
they were ushering me out the door,

1129
00:55:47,608 --> 00:55:49,608
and they say they're not.

1130
00:55:49,610 --> 00:55:51,911
Not that I'm that old,
but it's a bit of worry

1131
00:55:51,913 --> 00:55:55,281
about getting a full-time job
with my skill levels.

1132
00:55:57,451 --> 00:56:01,487
Sue had been a hairdresser
for most of her working life,

1133
00:56:01,489 --> 00:56:04,857
but at 49, she has a new career

1134
00:56:04,859 --> 00:56:08,327
as an occupational therapist
in a retirement home.

1135
00:56:08,329 --> 00:56:11,431
(Sue) You might be in your
40's and getting older,

1136
00:56:11,433 --> 00:56:13,966
but you still have a lot to add

1137
00:56:13,968 --> 00:56:16,536
and you can learn to go
in a different direction.

1138
00:56:16,538 --> 00:56:18,537
I call this my sea change.

1139
00:56:18,539 --> 00:56:20,573
Do you have ambitions?

1140
00:56:20,575 --> 00:56:22,341
Not really now.

1141
00:56:22,343 --> 00:56:26,145
I've been in this job ten years
and never asked for a pay rise.

1142
00:56:26,147 --> 00:56:28,513
That's just what
I've always been like.

1143
00:56:28,515 --> 00:56:32,151
Has it affected home life at all?

1144
00:56:32,153 --> 00:56:34,152
(Sue) It has affected
a little bit,

1145
00:56:34,154 --> 00:56:36,789
because I'm not there at home
as much as I used to be

1146
00:56:36,791 --> 00:56:39,158
for when Paul got home.

1147
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:42,428
It can be - and I'm sure
I'm not the only one -

1148
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:47,666
It can be quite startling. You get home
and you think, "There's no one here."

1149
00:56:47,668 --> 00:56:50,202
When I've been here for
30 years to be home to.

1150
00:56:50,204 --> 00:56:51,871
It's really different.

1151
00:56:51,873 --> 00:56:54,673
By the time they were 28,

1152
00:56:54,675 --> 00:56:57,042
Paul and Sue had two children -

1153
00:56:57,044 --> 00:56:59,978
Katy and Robert.

1154
00:57:02,582 --> 00:57:05,251
Katy did well at school

1155
00:57:05,253 --> 00:57:08,821
and got a place at university
to study archaeology.

1156
00:57:08,823 --> 00:57:12,758
They're photos of the dig
in Cyprus that I went on.

1157
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:15,260
And we were digging
in bronze age tombs

1158
00:57:15,262 --> 00:57:17,963
that are around the village.

1159
00:57:17,965 --> 00:57:20,899
You're the first person in
the family to go to university.

1160
00:57:20,901 --> 00:57:22,902
Was it a struggle for you?

1161
00:57:22,904 --> 00:57:26,405
It was a bit, because I
had to do it all by myself.

1162
00:57:26,407 --> 00:57:28,507
I had nobody to really help me,

1163
00:57:28,509 --> 00:57:30,676
'cause mum and dad
couldn't help me

1164
00:57:30,678 --> 00:57:32,845
with my essays or things like that.

1165
00:57:32,847 --> 00:57:34,847
What does university mean?

1166
00:57:34,849 --> 00:57:38,317
I'm pretty happy with Katy,
and I'm not having a go at Rob,

1167
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:40,319
but I've got views for Robert,

1168
00:57:40,321 --> 00:57:42,955
'cause he's struggling
a little bit.

1169
00:57:42,957 --> 00:57:47,159
Robert has trained
as a car mechanic.

1170
00:57:47,161 --> 00:57:51,731
He's got reading and writing
difficulties, and he's coping with that.

1171
00:57:51,733 --> 00:57:54,767
We'd like to see him be
a little bit more proactive

1172
00:57:54,769 --> 00:57:57,836
at doing literacy course
now he's a bit older.

1173
00:57:57,838 --> 00:58:01,707
But just day-to-day troubles
of making ends meet with money -

1174
00:58:01,709 --> 00:58:03,809
That's always hard.

1175
00:58:03,811 --> 00:58:05,945
He went nuts at me
for using the phone,

1176
00:58:05,947 --> 00:58:09,315
"No more fucking... You constantly
fuckin' do this all the time."

1177
00:58:09,317 --> 00:58:12,918
What's Robert got
that you gave him?

1178
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:15,488
Moodiness. I think Robert's
even a little bit more moody

1179
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:18,457
than what I've ever been.

1180
00:58:18,459 --> 00:58:22,928
He's not your average
relaxed 21-year-old.

1181
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:25,464
Whatcha doin'?

1182
00:58:25,466 --> 00:58:27,733
We only had two children,
because we thought

1183
00:58:27,735 --> 00:58:31,169
that we couldn't love any more
children as much as we loved our two.

1184
00:58:31,171 --> 00:58:33,973
Now we've got our two grandchildren.
We just love them -

1185
00:58:33,975 --> 00:58:37,009
You love them as much, really.
As much, yeah.

1186
00:58:37,011 --> 00:58:38,610
Yay!

1187
00:58:38,612 --> 00:58:40,146
With Rob and Stacey,

1188
00:58:40,148 --> 00:58:42,414
we don't really know how
long they're gonna last.

1189
00:58:42,416 --> 00:58:46,018
I keep my fingers crossed
they will last.

1190
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:50,155
We can only hope that they
work at it like we do.

1191
00:58:50,157 --> 00:58:52,692
That's better.
Thank you.

1192
00:58:52,694 --> 00:58:55,560
In their 20's,

1193
00:58:55,562 --> 00:58:58,297
Paul and Sue sold up,
bought an old van

1194
00:58:58,299 --> 00:59:00,066
and travelled across Australia.

1195
00:59:00,068 --> 00:59:02,101
I think it brought us
closer together,

1196
00:59:02,103 --> 00:59:04,103
because we really
got to know each other

1197
00:59:04,105 --> 00:59:07,339
and relied on each other so much.

1198
00:59:07,341 --> 00:59:10,976
One of the most important things

1199
00:59:10,978 --> 00:59:13,979
we ever did with our children
was spend time with them.

1200
00:59:13,981 --> 00:59:16,248
And particularly
when you've got holidays,

1201
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:19,252
to actually - which a lot
of parents do, you know -

1202
00:59:19,254 --> 00:59:22,421
Go camping with them.

1203
00:59:22,423 --> 00:59:26,092
We've been camping
there now for 19 years,

1204
00:59:26,094 --> 00:59:28,960
'cause Robert was two
when we first went there.

1205
00:59:28,962 --> 00:59:30,996
So does this beat the old van?

1206
00:59:30,998 --> 00:59:33,900
This is the Hilton
compared to that old van.

1207
00:59:33,902 --> 00:59:37,269
Any plans for any big trips
now the children have gone?

1208
00:59:37,271 --> 00:59:39,238
I think we'd like
to do something again,

1209
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,207
but you need to have the finances

1210
00:59:41,209 --> 00:59:43,842
to support yourself
for a few months.

1211
00:59:43,844 --> 00:59:47,713
The monitors opened the
washroom, sendin' us out.

1212
00:59:47,715 --> 00:59:51,817
"Well, there's no talking,"
and I wasn't talking today.

1213
00:59:51,819 --> 00:59:57,089
I'm more at peace around
the horses and the animals.

1214
00:59:57,091 --> 01:00:00,859
I can be upset, I can be on edge,
come down to the horses.

1215
01:00:00,861 --> 01:00:05,431
Within three or four minutes of being
here, and I've forgotten everything,

1216
01:00:05,433 --> 01:00:09,601
so it does calm you down.

1217
01:00:09,603 --> 01:00:11,604
(Michael) So last time I
came you had the horses.

1218
01:00:11,606 --> 01:00:13,438
What's happened to the horses?

1219
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:17,409
Well, we gave Poykin
away to some people

1220
01:00:17,411 --> 01:00:20,713
because it was a
little bit expensive

1221
01:00:20,715 --> 01:00:24,150
and also the fun went
out of it, basically.

1222
01:00:24,152 --> 01:00:26,152
How do you get that peace now?

1223
01:00:26,154 --> 01:00:28,286
Well, I think I got it
through running.

1224
01:00:31,224 --> 01:00:34,359
Well, most Sunday mornings,
we go training.

1225
01:00:34,361 --> 01:00:36,362
When Paul is doing marathons,

1226
01:00:36,364 --> 01:00:39,031
when he's gotta run great distances,

1227
01:00:39,033 --> 01:00:42,034
I follow along with the bike
as a bit of support

1228
01:00:42,036 --> 01:00:46,105
and I take drinks for him
so he doesn't get dehydrated.

1229
01:00:46,107 --> 01:00:48,807
Something we can do together,
so we do that.

1230
01:00:48,809 --> 01:00:51,710
We're not doing any
great distances, we're just -

1231
01:00:51,712 --> 01:00:53,746
I've got an injured knee.

1232
01:00:53,748 --> 01:00:57,550
Just trying to build it up so
it gets used to running again.

1233
01:00:57,552 --> 01:01:02,654
The host city marathon was my
first marathon I did up in Sydney.

1234
01:01:02,656 --> 01:01:05,624
I trialled the Olympic course,
and it was open to anyone.

1235
01:01:05,626 --> 01:01:09,328
So I figured if you were
gonna do a marathon,

1236
01:01:09,330 --> 01:01:11,997
that'd be the one to do.

1237
01:01:11,999 --> 01:01:16,135
Nearly died, but I enjoyed it.

1238
01:01:16,137 --> 01:01:21,040
Happiness to me is a love for
life and a love for people.

1239
01:01:21,042 --> 01:01:24,142
When you look back on the
marriage and the family,

1240
01:01:24,144 --> 01:01:25,811
Any regrets?

1241
01:01:25,813 --> 01:01:28,414
No, we wish we'd had more
children, but who knows?

1242
01:01:28,416 --> 01:01:30,883
If we'd had them, might
have gone, "No, too many."

1243
01:01:30,885 --> 01:01:35,321
We might be both
in the nuthouse.

1244
01:01:35,323 --> 01:01:39,424
But without a family,
what have you got? Nothing.

1245
01:01:39,426 --> 01:01:41,760
Well, that's the way I feel.

1246
01:01:41,762 --> 01:01:43,696
More than work,
more than achieving...?

1247
01:01:43,698 --> 01:01:46,031
Yeah. Like, what you've got,

1248
01:01:46,033 --> 01:01:50,135
you've got nothing unless you've
got family and your health anyway.

1249
01:01:50,137 --> 01:01:53,939
You'd be awfully lonely
without family, I think.

1250
01:01:55,875 --> 01:01:58,911
(man) Tell me, do you have
any boyfriends, Suzy?

1251
01:01:58,913 --> 01:02:01,780
Um, yes.

1252
01:02:01,782 --> 01:02:03,582
Tell me about him.

1253
01:02:03,584 --> 01:02:09,154
He lives up in Scotland,
and I think he's 13.

1254
01:02:09,156 --> 01:02:11,924
(Michael) Have you got
any boyfriends, Susan?

1255
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:19,731
What is your attitude
towards marriage for yourself?

1256
01:02:22,101 --> 01:02:23,635
Well, I don't know.

1257
01:02:23,637 --> 01:02:26,004
I mean, I haven't given
it a lot of thought,

1258
01:02:26,006 --> 01:02:29,775
'cause I am very,
very cynical about it.

1259
01:02:29,777 --> 01:02:33,779
But then, you know, you get a certain
amount of faith restored in it.

1260
01:02:33,781 --> 01:02:37,115
I mean, I've got friends, and
their parents are happily married,

1261
01:02:37,117 --> 01:02:39,785
and so it does put
faith back into you,

1262
01:02:39,787 --> 01:02:43,088
but me myself, I'm
very cynical about it.

1263
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:45,524
When I last saw you at 21,
you were nervous,

1264
01:02:45,526 --> 01:02:47,760
you were chain-smoking,
you were uptight,

1265
01:02:47,762 --> 01:02:50,396
and now you seem happy.

1266
01:02:50,398 --> 01:02:54,433
What's happened to you
over these last seven years?

1267
01:02:54,435 --> 01:02:56,869
I suppose Rupert.

1268
01:02:56,871 --> 01:02:59,571
I'll give you some credit.

1269
01:02:59,573 --> 01:03:03,409
I'm now chain-smoking.

1270
01:03:03,411 --> 01:03:08,114
No, I think you can't
just walk through a marriage

1271
01:03:08,116 --> 01:03:09,482
and think it's, you know,
once you get married

1272
01:03:09,484 --> 01:03:12,451
it's all going to be roses
and everything forever.

1273
01:03:12,453 --> 01:03:15,321
You know, you have -

1274
01:03:15,323 --> 01:03:17,622
Everybody has their rows,

1275
01:03:17,624 --> 01:03:20,192
but we've never yet had a row

1276
01:03:20,194 --> 01:03:22,728
that we haven't managed to sort out.

1277
01:03:22,730 --> 01:03:25,430
It's very hard to
actually say what it is

1278
01:03:25,432 --> 01:03:27,766
that goes on between a couple,

1279
01:03:27,768 --> 01:03:31,036
it's either there or it's not.

1280
01:03:31,038 --> 01:03:34,973
We've been married 27 years now.

1281
01:03:34,975 --> 01:03:38,410
Any marriage has
its ups and downs,

1282
01:03:38,412 --> 01:03:42,781
but somehow, whether it's
through luck or determination,

1283
01:03:42,783 --> 01:03:46,752
we've worked through
the difficult times.

1284
01:03:48,722 --> 01:03:51,857
He's just always
been there for me,

1285
01:03:51,859 --> 01:03:55,494
and I know I can rely on him.

1286
01:03:55,496 --> 01:03:59,097
And, you know, he's my punch bag

1287
01:03:59,099 --> 01:04:02,901
in the same way as I'm
probably his, but it works.

1288
01:04:02,903 --> 01:04:05,538
When I get married, I'd
like to have two children.

1289
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:08,607
I'm not very children-minded
at the moment.

1290
01:04:08,609 --> 01:04:11,543
I don't know if
I ever will be.

1291
01:04:11,545 --> 01:04:13,745
What do you think about them?

1292
01:04:13,747 --> 01:04:16,382
Oh, I don't like babies.

1293
01:04:16,384 --> 01:04:20,852
At 28, Suzy had two sons -

1294
01:04:20,854 --> 01:04:22,888
Thomas and Oliver.

1295
01:04:22,890 --> 01:04:25,290
By the time she was 35,

1296
01:04:25,292 --> 01:04:28,460
Suzy had a daughter Laura.

1297
01:04:28,462 --> 01:04:31,697
(boy) Mummy?
(Suzy) Yeah?

1298
01:04:31,699 --> 01:04:34,032
(Michael) So what are
the children up to?

1299
01:04:34,034 --> 01:04:38,737
They are - Tom is living
in London, having graduated,

1300
01:04:38,739 --> 01:04:40,973
and now working
and living in London,

1301
01:04:40,975 --> 01:04:44,844
Ollie is working
and living at home

1302
01:04:44,846 --> 01:04:48,613
and Laura is doing her as levels.

1303
01:04:48,615 --> 01:04:53,051
It was difficult when they
first started to move away -

1304
01:04:53,053 --> 01:04:56,454
All those memories
of the children growing up.

1305
01:04:56,456 --> 01:04:58,457
It's like a closed chapter now,

1306
01:04:58,459 --> 01:05:01,693
'cause you can't bring those -
bring those days back.

1307
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:08,267
I think what I admire about the
young today is their confidence,

1308
01:05:08,269 --> 01:05:10,769
and that's what I wished I'd had.

1309
01:05:10,771 --> 01:05:16,808
They just seem to take
life and deal with it.

1310
01:05:16,810 --> 01:05:20,045
(Michael) What sort
of things do you do?

1311
01:05:20,047 --> 01:05:24,850
Ride, swim, play tennis, ping-pong.

1312
01:05:24,852 --> 01:05:30,122
And I might play croquet,
anything like that.

1313
01:05:30,124 --> 01:05:32,124
(¶ piano)

1314
01:05:32,126 --> 01:05:35,493
(Suzy) I did have
a privileged childhood,

1315
01:05:35,495 --> 01:05:40,765
but you have to take responsibility
for your life somewhere along the line,

1316
01:05:40,767 --> 01:05:44,236
and some people take responsibility
earlier than others.

1317
01:05:44,238 --> 01:05:48,573
I was just a bit later taking it.

1318
01:05:48,575 --> 01:05:52,210
Maybe now is the first time

1319
01:05:52,212 --> 01:05:56,448
that I actually feel happy
within my own skin.

1320
01:05:56,450 --> 01:06:00,586
It's taken me a
long time to do it,

1321
01:06:00,588 --> 01:06:03,856
but I actually feel

1322
01:06:03,858 --> 01:06:06,591
that I can accept decisions,
wrong decisions, possibly,

1323
01:06:06,593 --> 01:06:08,660
that I've made in the past,

1324
01:06:08,662 --> 01:06:12,931
I am comfortable with it now.
I can live with it.

1325
01:06:12,933 --> 01:06:18,170
So what's it been like for you
being in these films?

1326
01:06:18,172 --> 01:06:22,908
Very difficult, very painful.

1327
01:06:22,910 --> 01:06:27,312
Not an experience
I've enjoyed in any way.

1328
01:06:27,314 --> 01:06:29,414
Every seven years,
it throws up issues

1329
01:06:29,416 --> 01:06:33,719
that I guess we all learn
to put into compartments

1330
01:06:33,721 --> 01:06:35,687
between the seven years,

1331
01:06:35,689 --> 01:06:39,491
and then it all gets opened up
again, and it's difficult.

1332
01:06:39,493 --> 01:06:42,727
(all talking)

1333
01:06:42,729 --> 01:06:44,730
We were all landed in it,

1334
01:06:44,732 --> 01:06:46,732
and most of us, have,
whatever reason,

1335
01:06:46,734 --> 01:06:50,269
chosen to go through with it.

1336
01:06:50,271 --> 01:06:55,073
I'm not an outgoing,
confident person.

1337
01:06:55,075 --> 01:06:56,575
I like my privacy.

1338
01:06:56,577 --> 01:07:01,279
I don't like however
many million people

1339
01:07:01,281 --> 01:07:04,683
picking over my life.

1340
01:07:04,685 --> 01:07:07,686
And is that what they do,
do you think?

1341
01:07:07,688 --> 01:07:13,225
I should think for a couple of minutes,
yes, and then it's yesterday's news.

1342
01:07:15,161 --> 01:07:20,566
And people seem to read into
what they think we all think,

1343
01:07:20,568 --> 01:07:23,368
which I find very hurtful, really,

1344
01:07:23,370 --> 01:07:26,138
'cause most of them come up
with things that they think,

1345
01:07:26,140 --> 01:07:29,574
which is nothing like
what's going through my head.

1346
01:07:29,576 --> 01:07:31,810
Oh, so she might be all right.

1347
01:07:31,812 --> 01:07:35,547
What's the point of people sort
of going into people's lives

1348
01:07:35,549 --> 01:07:37,849
and saying, "Why do you like
this?" and, "Why don't you?"

1349
01:07:37,851 --> 01:07:40,452
I just don't see
any point in it.

1350
01:07:40,454 --> 01:07:42,688
So have you had enough
of being in the film?

1351
01:07:42,690 --> 01:07:45,623
I mean, who knows
in seven years what -

1352
01:07:45,625 --> 01:07:47,626
Whether it'll be done again -

1353
01:07:47,628 --> 01:07:49,995
But this is me

1354
01:07:49,997 --> 01:07:54,599
saying hopefully I'll reach
my half-century next year,

1355
01:07:54,601 --> 01:07:59,271
and I shall bow out.

1356
01:08:00,673 --> 01:08:02,941
When I grow up,
I'd like to find out

1357
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:05,611
all about the moon and all that.

1358
01:08:05,613 --> 01:08:07,679
Nick, a farmer's son,

1359
01:08:07,681 --> 01:08:10,649
grew up in the Yorkshire Dales.

1360
01:08:10,651 --> 01:08:12,450
I said I was interested
in physics and chemistry.

1361
01:08:12,452 --> 01:08:14,252
Well, I'm not going
to do that here.

1362
01:08:14,254 --> 01:08:16,988
At 14, he was away
at boarding school

1363
01:08:16,990 --> 01:08:20,325
and at 21, reading
physics at Oxford.

1364
01:08:20,327 --> 01:08:22,561
(Michael) So what career
are you going to pursue?

1365
01:08:22,563 --> 01:08:26,131
(Nick) It depends whether I'll be good
enough to do what I want to really do.

1366
01:08:26,133 --> 01:08:31,803
I would like, if I
can, to do research.

1367
01:08:31,805 --> 01:08:34,773
By 28, he had moved to America

1368
01:08:34,775 --> 01:08:36,942
and was doing research
into nuclear fusion

1369
01:08:36,944 --> 01:08:39,611
at the university of Wisconsin.

1370
01:08:39,613 --> 01:08:41,479
The fusion reaction
gives off energy

1371
01:08:41,481 --> 01:08:45,917
and produces the power that would
be turned into electrical energy

1372
01:08:45,919 --> 01:08:48,353
and sent out to the consumer.

1373
01:08:48,355 --> 01:08:49,488
(Michael) How hot is it in there?

1374
01:08:49,490 --> 01:08:52,657
In there, it's about
10 million degrees.

1375
01:08:52,659 --> 01:08:56,327
At 35, he was an
associate professor,

1376
01:08:56,329 --> 01:08:58,697
And at 42, a full professor.

1377
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:05,304
And I've spent the last year and
a half writing a couple of books.

1378
01:09:05,306 --> 01:09:07,772
My ambition as a scientist is to
be more famous for doing science

1379
01:09:07,774 --> 01:09:09,795
than for being in this film,
but unfortunately,

1380
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:11,166
Michael, it's not gonna happen.

1381
01:09:12,679 --> 01:09:15,580
Over the years, Nick's
research hit trouble,

1382
01:09:15,582 --> 01:09:19,017
and by 49, he's had to abandon it,

1383
01:09:19,019 --> 01:09:21,920
because the containers needed to store
the hot gasses couldn't be developed.

1384
01:09:21,922 --> 01:09:25,858
(Michael) Was there a moment when you
realized that all you'd been doing

1385
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:29,094
wasn't going to work out?

1386
01:09:29,096 --> 01:09:31,963
I think it was more gradual.

1387
01:09:31,965 --> 01:09:34,666
I didn't want to admit
it for quite a while.

1388
01:09:34,668 --> 01:09:40,539
I mean, I really believed in it.
It was a huge let-down.

1389
01:09:40,541 --> 01:09:44,676
So the area that I'm looking
at is this times this.

1390
01:09:44,678 --> 01:09:49,014
I don't know why I've a
compulsion to teach, really.

1391
01:09:49,016 --> 01:09:53,385
It was always there in me. I wanted
to do it. I thought I'd be good at it.

1392
01:09:53,387 --> 01:09:55,686
When I go into a classroom
full of undergraduates,

1393
01:09:55,688 --> 01:09:58,957
I try and explain to them why
they might want to try and do it.

1394
01:09:58,959 --> 01:10:01,659
That's my little attempt to
open a little door for them.

1395
01:10:01,661 --> 01:10:04,362
So I'm hoping that you
remember me being very stupid

1396
01:10:04,364 --> 01:10:07,499
and going, "Ow, there's
arrows coming out of here."

1397
01:10:07,501 --> 01:10:09,434
Can we do that?
Any chance of that?

1398
01:10:09,436 --> 01:10:11,570
They can get information
from a book.

1399
01:10:11,572 --> 01:10:15,073
I have to keep them awake and make
the information a bit more interesting

1400
01:10:15,075 --> 01:10:16,274
than a book.

1401
01:10:16,276 --> 01:10:19,944
I'm doomed to do this
over and over and over.

1402
01:10:19,946 --> 01:10:21,946
OK, well, I didn't even
know it was happening,

1403
01:10:21,948 --> 01:10:23,315
so it was interesting...

1404
01:10:23,317 --> 01:10:25,917
Nobody's ever said that I
was a typical engineer.

1405
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:30,489
The undergraduates
tell jokes about engineers,

1406
01:10:30,491 --> 01:10:32,491
and the only one
I can repeat to you

1407
01:10:32,493 --> 01:10:35,460
is, "How you can tell if
an engineer is an extrovert?"

1408
01:10:35,462 --> 01:10:39,097
And the answer is, "He looks at
your shoes when he's talking to you."

1409
01:10:39,099 --> 01:10:41,500
Even though he's clearly
a megastar, it's like...

1410
01:10:41,502 --> 01:10:44,035
Somebody came up
with a theory recently

1411
01:10:44,037 --> 01:10:46,471
that a lot of scientists
and mathematicians

1412
01:10:46,473 --> 01:10:48,239
are just borderline autistic.

1413
01:10:48,241 --> 01:10:52,310
I could easily be borderline
autistic, you know.

1414
01:10:52,312 --> 01:10:56,882
I don't quite get how other people
feel about things sometimes, you know.

1415
01:10:56,884 --> 01:10:58,983
(Michael) Do you
have a girlfriend?

1416
01:11:01,053 --> 01:11:04,455
I don't want to answer that.

1417
01:11:04,457 --> 01:11:08,760
I don't answer those
kind of questions.

1418
01:11:08,762 --> 01:11:12,363
I thought that one would
come up because when I was...

1419
01:11:12,365 --> 01:11:13,756
When I was doing the other one,

1420
01:11:13,781 --> 01:11:16,134
and somebody said,
"What do you think about girls?"

1421
01:11:16,136 --> 01:11:18,670
And I said, "I don't answer
questions like that."

1422
01:11:18,672 --> 01:11:20,772
Is that the reason
you're asking it?

1423
01:11:20,774 --> 01:11:24,276
I thought so. Um...

1424
01:11:25,544 --> 01:11:27,579
The best answer would be to say

1425
01:11:27,581 --> 01:11:29,614
that I don't answer
questions like that,

1426
01:11:29,616 --> 01:11:32,617
but, I mean, it was what
I said when I was seven,

1427
01:11:32,619 --> 01:11:36,688
and it's still the most
sensible. What about them?

1428
01:11:36,690 --> 01:11:39,291
Nick was only 17
when I first met him.

1429
01:11:39,293 --> 01:11:45,097
If he'd been somebody who had had fixed
ideas of a woman's role in marriage

1430
01:11:45,099 --> 01:11:49,233
that meant dinner on the table
at six every evening...

1431
01:11:49,235 --> 01:11:52,137
Ah, didn't I tell you about that?

1432
01:11:52,139 --> 01:11:55,173
His wife Jackie also
taught at the university,

1433
01:11:55,175 --> 01:11:57,776
and they had a son Adam.

1434
01:11:57,778 --> 01:12:00,712
Six years ago, they divorced.

1435
01:12:00,714 --> 01:12:03,582
Well, it was incredibly hard.

1436
01:12:03,584 --> 01:12:06,885
What I concluded,

1437
01:12:06,887 --> 01:12:09,888
and I have talked to other people
about this who've gone through it,

1438
01:12:09,890 --> 01:12:12,123
I'm not sure if they feel
it as strongly as I did,

1439
01:12:12,125 --> 01:12:14,125
but it was like a death.

1440
01:12:14,127 --> 01:12:17,428
Anything could happen.
We could easily drift apart.

1441
01:12:17,430 --> 01:12:19,697
There are so many
pressures on people.

1442
01:12:19,699 --> 01:12:22,401
If your spouse died, you
could look back and think,

1443
01:12:22,403 --> 01:12:24,769
"Well, it was wonderful
while it lasted,"

1444
01:12:24,771 --> 01:12:28,372
But in a divorce,
you can't look back and say,

1445
01:12:28,374 --> 01:12:32,110
"These are all happy memories."

1446
01:12:32,112 --> 01:12:34,646
It wasn't my decision.

1447
01:12:34,648 --> 01:12:39,751
She went to England.
Her father was ill.

1448
01:12:39,753 --> 01:12:41,753
By the time she'd landed,
he had died,

1449
01:12:41,755 --> 01:12:44,222
and when she came back,

1450
01:12:44,224 --> 01:12:46,258
it was like a different
person came back.

1451
01:12:47,793 --> 01:12:49,728
Was I responsible?

1452
01:12:49,730 --> 01:12:52,296
I could have been braver
about some things,

1453
01:12:52,298 --> 01:12:55,867
but if I'd been braver,
it might have ended sooner.

1454
01:12:55,869 --> 01:12:57,868
You can talk to me
by myself outside,

1455
01:12:57,870 --> 01:13:00,972
but I'll just meet you
by the garage, ok?

1456
01:13:00,974 --> 01:13:02,774
All right, bye.

1457
01:13:02,776 --> 01:13:04,809
It's enormously hard
to deal with.

1458
01:13:04,811 --> 01:13:09,480
The worst part of it was seeing
how it would affect my son.

1459
01:13:09,482 --> 01:13:11,049
(Michael) How old was he?

1460
01:13:11,051 --> 01:13:13,318
Ten.

1461
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:15,921
When he was first told,

1462
01:13:15,923 --> 01:13:19,357
he was terribly, terribly upset,

1463
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:22,727
and then he just
pulled himself together

1464
01:13:22,729 --> 01:13:27,099
and didn't want to talk
about it anymore.

1465
01:13:27,101 --> 01:13:29,934
He's made the most of it -
I mean, the best of it.

1466
01:13:29,936 --> 01:13:32,838
Made the best that
he can of it, I guess.

1467
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:36,575
Take it easy, Adam.
Main thing is not to crash.

1468
01:13:36,577 --> 01:13:38,744
Really? You don't want
me to crash right now?

1469
01:13:38,746 --> 01:13:40,745
(Michael) How does
he deal with it now?

1470
01:13:40,747 --> 01:13:44,215
He doesn't talk to me
about it very much at all.

1471
01:13:44,217 --> 01:13:46,985
He's a private person.

1472
01:13:46,987 --> 01:13:50,421
It's very, very hard for me

1473
01:13:50,423 --> 01:13:56,294
to be spending a large part of
my time with him not around.

1474
01:13:58,931 --> 01:14:03,635
Hi, Graham. What you doing?

1475
01:14:03,637 --> 01:14:05,870
I had to go to a graduation.

1476
01:14:05,872 --> 01:14:08,639
One of my students
was getting his Ph.D.,

1477
01:14:08,641 --> 01:14:10,842
and he insisted
I go there with him,

1478
01:14:10,844 --> 01:14:15,580
and I looked around, and the
person behind me was Chris...

1479
01:14:15,582 --> 01:14:18,349
Hey, Graham.

1480
01:14:18,351 --> 01:14:21,119
...who is my new wife.

1481
01:14:21,121 --> 01:14:23,087
Are you ok?

1482
01:14:23,089 --> 01:14:24,990
(Michael) Did you
fall in love quickly?

1483
01:14:24,992 --> 01:14:26,925
Immediately.

1484
01:14:26,927 --> 01:14:30,462
Except that you decided that if I
couldn't find you, I'd failed the test.

1485
01:14:30,464 --> 01:14:35,567
I decided it was
his work to find me.

1486
01:14:35,569 --> 01:14:38,670
We did shake hands
at the end of graduation,

1487
01:14:38,672 --> 01:14:40,872
stood up and said who we were,
but he immediately forgot.

1488
01:14:40,874 --> 01:14:42,907
He couldn't remember who I was.

1489
01:14:42,909 --> 01:14:45,043
"I know who she is,

1490
01:14:45,045 --> 01:14:46,644
so I don't have to worry
about this anymore."

1491
01:14:46,646 --> 01:14:50,848
So I forgot. I do -
that's very me.

1492
01:14:50,850 --> 01:14:55,553
She came down to the
student union to meet me,

1493
01:14:55,555 --> 01:14:58,322
And, you know, I barely
knew what she looked like.

1494
01:14:58,324 --> 01:15:00,991
I looked at her...
"I guess that's her,"

1495
01:15:00,993 --> 01:15:03,894
And I sort of looked and did
this, and she did the same.

1496
01:15:03,896 --> 01:15:05,829
She did a mirror image
of that gesture,

1497
01:15:05,831 --> 01:15:09,166
and I thought, "I can't
explain what that was,"

1498
01:15:09,168 --> 01:15:10,802
But I just felt

1499
01:15:10,804 --> 01:15:13,904
very strongly drawn to her
by that little gesture.

1500
01:15:13,906 --> 01:15:17,241
And there was no way
I would say no

1501
01:15:17,243 --> 01:15:19,677
to being married to this man.

1502
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:21,679
I wanted to be with him.

1503
01:15:22,881 --> 01:15:25,616
Has he changed my life?
Dramatically.

1504
01:15:25,618 --> 01:15:29,387
Have I changed as a person?
I hope so.

1505
01:15:29,389 --> 01:15:31,289
You'll give them a push?

1506
01:15:31,291 --> 01:15:33,291
I don't mean
to be superficial,

1507
01:15:33,293 --> 01:15:37,195
but I think she's the most
beautiful woman I've ever seen.

1508
01:15:37,197 --> 01:15:38,663
(Michael) Is he sexy?

1509
01:15:38,665 --> 01:15:41,465
Oh, man... (laughs)

1510
01:15:41,467 --> 01:15:43,667
Absolutely.

1511
01:15:46,138 --> 01:15:49,941
Didn't you have fun
with that one?

1512
01:15:49,943 --> 01:15:52,009
Graham was very good about
the ducks. The ducks were...

1513
01:15:52,011 --> 01:15:55,645
I only have one child, Courtney,
and he only has one child.

1514
01:15:55,647 --> 01:15:59,983
There's a symmetry with that.

1515
01:15:59,985 --> 01:16:05,222
(Michael) Would you ever have wanted
a child of your own, the two of you?

1516
01:16:05,224 --> 01:16:07,357
Well, absolutely,

1517
01:16:07,359 --> 01:16:11,929
but it's not exactly practical,
so we're just...

1518
01:16:11,931 --> 01:16:17,602
No. Of course, Graham has added
an element that's just joy,

1519
01:16:17,604 --> 01:16:23,040
And I know Nick likes little guys.
He just likes little kids.

1520
01:16:23,042 --> 01:16:27,011
They'd like to come out
for a holiday in the country

1521
01:16:27,013 --> 01:16:31,248
when we like - when I like
to have a holiday in the town.

1522
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:33,584
It is very difficult
being in a place

1523
01:16:33,586 --> 01:16:37,254
where you're a long way away
from all your background,

1524
01:16:37,256 --> 01:16:39,790
and you don't have
any sort of support network.

1525
01:16:39,792 --> 01:16:42,726
(chatter)

1526
01:16:42,728 --> 01:16:44,795
My parents are alive.

1527
01:16:44,797 --> 01:16:47,264
They both had very significant
health issues.

1528
01:16:47,266 --> 01:16:52,002
My father keeps pointing out
that old age isn't for sissies.

1529
01:16:52,004 --> 01:16:54,805
You need a secretary.

1530
01:16:54,807 --> 01:16:58,743
Nick has two younger brothers
back in England -

1531
01:16:58,745 --> 01:17:01,345
Andrew and Christopher.

1532
01:17:03,181 --> 01:17:05,416
Christopher, the deaf one,
got divorced,

1533
01:17:05,418 --> 01:17:08,185
and he reported to my mother that
if Nicky can do it, then so can I,

1534
01:17:08,187 --> 01:17:10,721
so that changed.

1535
01:17:12,657 --> 01:17:14,358
(Michael) Are you
missing England?

1536
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:16,059
I always miss England.

1537
01:17:16,061 --> 01:17:19,696
I was really not
the sort of person

1538
01:17:19,698 --> 01:17:22,700
who should ever
have moved very far.

1539
01:17:22,702 --> 01:17:24,968
When he was 42,

1540
01:17:24,970 --> 01:17:28,072
we took Nick back to where
he had grown up in the Dales.

1541
01:17:28,074 --> 01:17:31,442
What did you learn here, do you
think, that you carried with you?

1542
01:17:31,444 --> 01:17:34,912
I sort of feel as if you could
look deep somewhere inside me,

1543
01:17:34,914 --> 01:17:37,881
I feel like there's some
of this in there somewhere.

1544
01:17:37,883 --> 01:17:43,454
I think of it as being magnificent
but rather grim, really.

1545
01:17:43,456 --> 01:17:47,258
It's very uncompromising,
and sometimes it's rather tragic,

1546
01:17:47,260 --> 01:17:50,694
but, you know, it makes
other places you go

1547
01:17:50,696 --> 01:17:53,230
seem rather trivial as well.

1548
01:17:53,232 --> 01:17:56,434
We call it one of our Dales rooms.

1549
01:17:56,436 --> 01:18:01,171
We have things that reflect
the Dales in the room,

1550
01:18:01,173 --> 01:18:03,907
we have cards that we framed,

1551
01:18:03,909 --> 01:18:06,477
and some of the china
from Nick's family

1552
01:18:06,479 --> 01:18:09,113
is displayed up here.

1553
01:18:13,118 --> 01:18:17,521
Well, we're driving
from Madison to Minneapolis,

1554
01:18:17,523 --> 01:18:20,658
'cause Chris lives in Minneapolis,
and I live in Madison,

1555
01:18:20,660 --> 01:18:24,094
so we go up and down
alternate weekends.

1556
01:18:24,096 --> 01:18:27,898
(Michael) Does it put a stress
on the relationship,

1557
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:31,502
these separations
and reuniting?

1558
01:18:31,504 --> 01:18:37,007
I would say, you know, absence
makes the heart grow fonder, really.

1559
01:18:37,009 --> 01:18:39,509
Chris lives in Minneapolis,

1560
01:18:39,511 --> 01:18:41,845
a five-hour drive from Madison,

1561
01:18:41,847 --> 01:18:45,516
where she is an associate professor
in the department of education.

1562
01:18:45,518 --> 01:18:49,520
Hey, you want to see something?

1563
01:18:49,522 --> 01:18:51,622
(Michael) Work is a big part
of both your lives, isn't it?

1564
01:18:51,624 --> 01:18:52,956
It is.

1565
01:18:52,958 --> 01:18:57,094
Yeah, so we're both
kind of workaholics.

1566
01:18:57,096 --> 01:19:00,364
Is there anything that you
would like to change?

1567
01:19:00,366 --> 01:19:04,501
Oh, that would be really risky
business, wouldn't it?

1568
01:19:04,503 --> 01:19:07,204
Well, I thought you had
changed a few of them, no?

1569
01:19:10,275 --> 01:19:14,211
You know, you don't mess
with mother nature

1570
01:19:14,213 --> 01:19:16,513
in terms of little things,

1571
01:19:16,515 --> 01:19:19,016
like how somebody does
their toothpaste,

1572
01:19:19,018 --> 01:19:20,751
those silly nonsense things.

1573
01:19:20,753 --> 01:19:25,389
He would not just say yes,
he immediately attended to it.

1574
01:19:25,391 --> 01:19:27,757
I had never been
with anybody who did,

1575
01:19:27,759 --> 01:19:30,360
so you have to be really careful
with what you ask him to do.

1576
01:19:30,362 --> 01:19:32,463
Oh, go easy on the butter,
please, all right?

1577
01:19:32,465 --> 01:19:34,131
OK.

1578
01:19:34,133 --> 01:19:38,202
I mean, I could see it being
a slippery slope, you know.

1579
01:19:38,204 --> 01:19:40,204
I didn't want to go that way

1580
01:19:40,206 --> 01:19:43,707
in terms of my ordering his life...

1581
01:19:43,709 --> 01:19:47,177
I didn't want him to be
a different person.

1582
01:19:47,179 --> 01:19:50,681
If I can change in the world,
I'd change it into a diamond.

1583
01:19:50,683 --> 01:19:53,783
I think this film
is extremely important.

1584
01:19:53,785 --> 01:19:57,988
It's important to me, but it seems
to be important to other people as well.

1585
01:19:57,990 --> 01:20:01,525
That doesn't make it
an easy thing.

1586
01:20:01,527 --> 01:20:03,894
It's an incredibly
hard thing to be in,

1587
01:20:03,896 --> 01:20:09,700
and I can't even begin to describe how
emotionally draining and wrenching it is

1588
01:20:09,702 --> 01:20:12,335
just to make the film
and to do the interviews,

1589
01:20:12,337 --> 01:20:15,772
and that's even
when I am pretending

1590
01:20:15,774 --> 01:20:18,342
that nobody else
is watching it.

1591
01:20:18,344 --> 01:20:19,909
(barks)

1592
01:20:19,911 --> 01:20:25,649
I think it's a heavy reminder
that he's missing his roots.

1593
01:20:25,651 --> 01:20:29,152
I mean, there are an awful lot
of emotions attached

1594
01:20:29,154 --> 01:20:32,022
to having a scrapbook
that's as vivid as this.

1595
01:20:35,159 --> 01:20:37,294
I'm going to work
in Woolworth's.

1596
01:20:37,296 --> 01:20:38,595
(TV playing)

1597
01:20:38,597 --> 01:20:41,598
Lynn is the third
of our east end girls.

1598
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:43,734
She went to primary school
with Jackie and Sue,

1599
01:20:43,736 --> 01:20:45,769
but chose to go on
to a grammar school.

1600
01:20:45,771 --> 01:20:49,106
At 21, she set out on a career

1601
01:20:49,108 --> 01:20:52,876
as a children's librarian in a
mobile library in east London.

1602
01:20:52,878 --> 01:20:55,278
Have I stamped yours?
Yes.

1603
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:58,715
I've not stamped yours.
Sleeping beauty.

1604
01:20:58,717 --> 01:21:02,652
Teaching children
the beauty of books

1605
01:21:02,654 --> 01:21:06,857
and watching their faces
as books unfold to them

1606
01:21:06,859 --> 01:21:08,992
is just fantastic.

1607
01:21:08,994 --> 01:21:11,562
To work with children of that age,
you've got to love them,

1608
01:21:11,564 --> 01:21:13,097
and I love children.

1609
01:21:14,833 --> 01:21:17,367
Because of cuts
in the education budget,

1610
01:21:17,369 --> 01:21:19,536
the mobile library was shut down.

1611
01:21:19,538 --> 01:21:23,941
At 42, Lynn was working
at Bethnal green library.

1612
01:21:23,943 --> 01:21:26,410
You can draw, better than I can.

1613
01:21:28,246 --> 01:21:29,680
Good morning.

1614
01:21:29,682 --> 01:21:31,915
At 49, she's still there.

1615
01:21:31,917 --> 01:21:33,650
Good morning.
(boy) What about you?

1616
01:21:33,652 --> 01:21:35,419
Good morning.

1617
01:21:35,421 --> 01:21:38,054
(woman) Are you going to say hello?
Good morning.

1618
01:21:38,056 --> 01:21:41,492
(Michael) How much of your work
is with people like this?

1619
01:21:41,494 --> 01:21:45,228
Probably 5%. It's a very,
very small part of it,

1620
01:21:45,230 --> 01:21:49,967
But probably, currently,
the most challenging part of it.

1621
01:21:49,969 --> 01:21:51,268
Elephant.

1622
01:21:51,270 --> 01:21:53,704
He's an elephant.
Where's the elephant?

1623
01:21:55,406 --> 01:22:01,078
We still get six other schools
regularly send classes in here.

1624
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:02,913
It's busy most days.

1625
01:22:02,915 --> 01:22:07,318
Well, I know he loves her,
and he loves her.

1626
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:09,619
I don't.
I love him.

1627
01:22:09,621 --> 01:22:13,256
I've been married a year
in a couple of months.

1628
01:22:13,258 --> 01:22:17,794
You do think, "Christ,
what have I done?"

1629
01:22:19,364 --> 01:22:22,532
When she was 19,
she married Russ.

1630
01:22:22,534 --> 01:22:25,803
We married young,

1631
01:22:25,805 --> 01:22:29,740
but because we wanted to go out
and have fun together.

1632
01:22:31,142 --> 01:22:33,644
30 years,
and we're still together.

1633
01:22:33,646 --> 01:22:36,213
He's my soul mate,
he's my partner.

1634
01:22:36,215 --> 01:22:39,148
We respect each other,

1635
01:22:39,150 --> 01:22:43,220
hence he's not here, and you
will not see him on this film,

1636
01:22:43,222 --> 01:22:45,889
because he has always, always felt

1637
01:22:45,891 --> 01:22:50,994
that the intrusion into our
private life that this causes

1638
01:22:50,996 --> 01:22:53,197
is too much.

1639
01:22:53,199 --> 01:22:56,667
I wanted white wedding,
all trimmings,

1640
01:22:56,669 --> 01:23:02,406
and Russ would've been
satisfied with very little.

1641
01:23:02,408 --> 01:23:04,341
(Michael) Are you in love?

1642
01:23:04,343 --> 01:23:09,312
Very, very much.

1643
01:23:10,515 --> 01:23:12,516
He knows how much I love him,

1644
01:23:12,518 --> 01:23:15,552
and in my heart of hearts,
I know how much he loves me.

1645
01:23:15,554 --> 01:23:18,789
I put him on the spot sometimes.

1646
01:23:18,791 --> 01:23:22,025
If I could, I would have
two girls and two boys.

1647
01:23:22,027 --> 01:23:24,127
(Jackie)
Yeah, so would I.

1648
01:23:26,297 --> 01:23:30,801
Lynn and Russ have two
daughters - Sarah and Emma.

1649
01:23:35,206 --> 01:23:39,977
Emma's installation coordinator
for a window company.

1650
01:23:39,979 --> 01:23:45,716
Sarah is an accessories buyer.
It's a family-run business.

1651
01:23:47,318 --> 01:23:49,486
At 42, the girls

1652
01:23:49,488 --> 01:23:52,856
were both doing
very well at school.

1653
01:23:52,858 --> 01:23:54,892
Neither of the girls
went to university?

1654
01:23:54,894 --> 01:23:55,925
No, no.

1655
01:23:55,927 --> 01:23:58,295
Was that disappointing to you?

1656
01:23:58,297 --> 01:24:01,097
No. Their choice.
We discussed it.

1657
01:24:01,099 --> 01:24:03,400
It's what they wanted to do.

1658
01:24:03,402 --> 01:24:07,671
They felt that the academic side
wasn't for them.

1659
01:24:07,673 --> 01:24:11,275
You have to accept
that it's their lives,

1660
01:24:11,277 --> 01:24:15,512
and you can only guide
and be there for them.

1661
01:24:15,514 --> 01:24:18,615
Aw, you boy.
Where's your drink?

1662
01:24:18,617 --> 01:24:20,550
So you got a grandson?

1663
01:24:20,552 --> 01:24:23,954
He's a lovely lad,
he really is.

1664
01:24:23,956 --> 01:24:26,390
I'm watching him
in the same way.

1665
01:24:26,392 --> 01:24:30,127
I mean, from 21 years ago,
when I held Sarah up

1666
01:24:30,129 --> 01:24:34,198
When she was just born, and
now I am watching Emma now,

1667
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:37,534
and what goes round,
comes round,

1668
01:24:37,536 --> 01:24:39,703
because Emma now says that
she says things to Connor

1669
01:24:39,705 --> 01:24:42,772
that she can hear me
saying to her.

1670
01:24:42,774 --> 01:24:44,007
Rabbits.

1671
01:24:44,009 --> 01:24:45,675
Yeah. You have to look out
for their holes.

1672
01:24:45,677 --> 01:24:47,711
That still catches me out
sometimes

1673
01:24:47,713 --> 01:24:51,115
when suddenly I say something
that was purely and utterly me mum.

1674
01:24:52,417 --> 01:24:56,286
So was the arrival of Connor
a shock to you?

1675
01:24:56,288 --> 01:25:00,290
No. Well, yeah, but, no.

1676
01:25:00,292 --> 01:25:03,493
I mean, as soon as Emma
was expecting Connor,

1677
01:25:03,495 --> 01:25:07,497
Got the phone call -
"Mum, need to meet you."

1678
01:25:07,499 --> 01:25:14,371
So she actually told me face to
face that she was expecting. Fine.

1679
01:25:14,373 --> 01:25:19,309
She was 19.
She's old enough.

1680
01:25:19,311 --> 01:25:21,811
Probably watching you.
You'll go to bed.

1681
01:25:21,813 --> 01:25:26,416
When she was 35, Lynn
was having health problems.

1682
01:25:26,418 --> 01:25:29,252
Stuck all these tubes
up inside me and discovered

1683
01:25:29,254 --> 01:25:33,223
that I've got these veins up
here that shouldn't be there.

1684
01:25:33,225 --> 01:25:34,658
In your brain?

1685
01:25:34,660 --> 01:25:36,092
Mm-hmm.

1686
01:25:36,094 --> 01:25:38,128
And what can they do about it?

1687
01:25:38,130 --> 01:25:40,130
Not a lot at the moment.

1688
01:25:40,132 --> 01:25:41,798
No change.

1689
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:46,503
It's not going away,
but it's no more problems.

1690
01:25:46,505 --> 01:25:49,105
Nothing, and I, mean,

1691
01:25:49,107 --> 01:25:52,475
you have the aches and pains
of getting older.

1692
01:25:54,912 --> 01:25:58,681
I've got bilateral carpal-tunnel
syndrome in both my wrists.

1693
01:25:58,683 --> 01:26:01,585
Guess who had it.
My mother.

1694
01:26:01,587 --> 01:26:07,256
And that comes and goes,
hence magnetic bracelets,

1695
01:26:07,258 --> 01:26:13,163
which help, but you
have to overcome it.

1696
01:26:13,165 --> 01:26:14,798
What's white?
Red.

1697
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:16,466
Yeah, we know that's red.

1698
01:26:16,468 --> 01:26:18,035
For the last 30 years,

1699
01:26:18,037 --> 01:26:20,203
bang my head
against a brick wall

1700
01:26:20,205 --> 01:26:22,572
to maintain children's services,

1701
01:26:22,574 --> 01:26:25,609
but this time round,
no one's listening.

1702
01:26:25,611 --> 01:26:28,111
We've just done purple.

1703
01:26:28,113 --> 01:26:32,582
They say that the work that I do
that anybody can do it.

1704
01:26:32,584 --> 01:26:34,684
Blue.

1705
01:26:34,686 --> 01:26:38,154
There would be
no specialist running it.

1706
01:26:38,156 --> 01:26:39,856
One.

1707
01:26:39,858 --> 01:26:43,527
I may not have a job.

1708
01:26:43,529 --> 01:26:45,128
Hern loves Tintin.

1709
01:26:45,130 --> 01:26:48,198
Hern absolutely adores
Tintin.

1710
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:50,266
It's cost cutting.

1711
01:26:51,636 --> 01:26:54,604
So that's what it's about?
Yeah.

1712
01:26:54,606 --> 01:26:57,507
They would deny that.

1713
01:26:57,509 --> 01:26:59,909
Can you speak to me today?

1714
01:26:59,911 --> 01:27:02,011
No?

1715
01:27:02,013 --> 01:27:03,947
I see.

1716
01:27:03,949 --> 01:27:06,283
Is it emotionally very demanding

1717
01:27:06,285 --> 01:27:08,718
working like this
with people like this?

1718
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:12,589
Yeah, but it's so fulfilling

1719
01:27:12,591 --> 01:27:17,093
that, uh - beyond belief.

1720
01:27:17,095 --> 01:27:21,632
Azir, can you say it for me?
I know you can.

1721
01:27:21,634 --> 01:27:23,800
But are you get -
no! (laughs)

1722
01:27:23,802 --> 01:27:27,170
No, you're not gonna
do it today.

1723
01:27:27,172 --> 01:27:30,674
Azir spoke to me on the phone
a couple of years ago.

1724
01:27:30,676 --> 01:27:34,711
First time he'd ever spoken
to me, and really got me.

1725
01:27:34,713 --> 01:27:37,447
It's extremely difficult
for him to speak,

1726
01:27:37,449 --> 01:27:40,616
and when he does, you know
he's making so much effort,

1727
01:27:40,618 --> 01:27:42,886
and it gets me.

1728
01:27:42,888 --> 01:27:44,854
Hello.
Hello.

1729
01:27:44,856 --> 01:27:47,357
Excellent.

1730
01:27:47,359 --> 01:27:50,360
Thank you, Azir.
Thank you.

1731
01:27:52,063 --> 01:27:56,099
You've come a long way
since the back of the van.

1732
01:27:56,101 --> 01:27:59,235
No. I was on the back
of a bus yesterday.

1733
01:27:59,237 --> 01:28:02,439
We took a mobile vehicle
out to a school

1734
01:28:02,441 --> 01:28:04,841
who was having a book week
just round the corner,

1735
01:28:04,843 --> 01:28:08,811
and I had forgotten
how much it sways.

1736
01:28:10,281 --> 01:28:11,682
Where's your stamp?

1737
01:28:11,684 --> 01:28:13,684
Been a hell of a commitment
for you, hasn't it?

1738
01:28:13,686 --> 01:28:15,852
Yeah, but...

1739
01:28:19,423 --> 01:28:21,858
...But it will end.

1740
01:28:21,860 --> 01:28:25,161
But has it been
worth it all?

1741
01:28:25,163 --> 01:28:26,196
Yeah, very much.

1742
01:28:29,934 --> 01:28:31,668
Come on, speed it up.

1743
01:28:31,670 --> 01:28:34,403
All these things that I
have said over the years

1744
01:28:34,405 --> 01:28:39,343
are flying through my mind at the moment,
but, yes, it has been worth it.

1745
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:46,683
And you better cut it, 'cause
otherwise, I'm gonna cry.

1746
01:28:55,192 --> 01:28:58,328
(man) What do you think
about rich people?

1747
01:28:58,330 --> 01:29:01,765
Well, not much.

1748
01:29:01,767 --> 01:29:03,900
Tell me about them.

1749
01:29:03,902 --> 01:29:07,337
Well, they think they can do everything
without you doing it as well.

1750
01:29:09,373 --> 01:29:11,808
Simon was brought up
in a children's home,

1751
01:29:11,810 --> 01:29:15,077
the only child
of a single parent.

1752
01:29:15,079 --> 01:29:17,447
Rich people, they have
all different things.

1753
01:29:17,449 --> 01:29:19,449
Have everything they want.

1754
01:29:19,451 --> 01:29:21,718
Whereas poor people,
they don't have nothing,

1755
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:24,087
and they know
they haven't got nothing,

1756
01:29:24,089 --> 01:29:28,324
and so they know
they're missing something.

1757
01:29:28,326 --> 01:29:30,593
(Michael)
What are you missing?

1758
01:29:30,595 --> 01:29:33,696
I'm missing a bike

1759
01:29:33,698 --> 01:29:37,767
and a fishing rod and...

1760
01:29:37,769 --> 01:29:42,505
20 years ago, when I was born,

1761
01:29:42,507 --> 01:29:44,508
an illegitimate child,

1762
01:29:44,510 --> 01:29:47,777
that's something
that's only whispered about.

1763
01:29:47,779 --> 01:29:52,048
People, you know, feel strongly
about it in those days,

1764
01:29:52,050 --> 01:29:57,920
but nowadays, it's...
It's not a serious matter.

1765
01:29:57,922 --> 01:30:01,157
The serious point is whether you
stay with somebody or you leave them.

1766
01:30:01,159 --> 01:30:06,062
Since 21, I've got married,

1767
01:30:06,064 --> 01:30:10,300
had a couple of kids, and...

1768
01:30:10,302 --> 01:30:14,603
By 28, he had married Yvonne,
and they had 5 children.

1769
01:30:14,605 --> 01:30:18,108
I don't think there's anybody else I
could have ever married except Yvonne.

1770
01:30:18,110 --> 01:30:21,611
She's been my life, really,
because we're together,

1771
01:30:21,613 --> 01:30:24,714
we have our children
and everything.

1772
01:30:24,716 --> 01:30:28,585
By 35, they were divorced.

1773
01:30:31,488 --> 01:30:35,391
At 42, he had married Vienetta.

1774
01:30:37,160 --> 01:30:40,096
We used to go out when we were younger.
We met in the launderette.

1775
01:30:41,432 --> 01:30:44,134
Once a week. Once a week
at the launderette.

1776
01:30:44,136 --> 01:30:46,769
Baked beans.

1777
01:30:46,771 --> 01:30:48,204
Go and get the water and...

1778
01:30:48,206 --> 01:30:50,640
At one stage, we went
to marriage guidance,

1779
01:30:50,642 --> 01:30:53,043
'cause the pressures
of being together

1780
01:30:53,045 --> 01:30:58,414
were getting to us because we are
two completely different people.

1781
01:30:58,416 --> 01:31:02,318
I'm very laid back,

1782
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:04,887
and she always says

1783
01:31:04,889 --> 01:31:08,525
if I go any further back,
I'll fall over.

1784
01:31:08,527 --> 01:31:11,695
When two people are together

1785
01:31:11,697 --> 01:31:14,263
and they have both
have separate lives,

1786
01:31:14,265 --> 01:31:16,800
it is hard, and there
are silly things,

1787
01:31:16,802 --> 01:31:19,702
like leaving the toilet
seat up or something

1788
01:31:19,704 --> 01:31:22,338
or when I put something here,
I expect to see it there.

1789
01:31:22,340 --> 01:31:24,340
Simon can be really untidy.

1790
01:31:24,342 --> 01:31:26,676
He'll take everything off
and fling it around the house.

1791
01:31:26,678 --> 01:31:27,810
Sorry, dear.

1792
01:31:27,812 --> 01:31:30,780
Don't get it all mixed up.

1793
01:31:30,782 --> 01:31:32,548
(Michael) Is he romantic?

1794
01:31:32,550 --> 01:31:34,750
If we've had an argument,
and he doesn't know,

1795
01:31:34,752 --> 01:31:38,488
'cause I will shout, and he'll
think, "What have I done?"

1796
01:31:38,490 --> 01:31:42,291
And I'll be here, like now, and I'll
be here, and I'd see him with flowers

1797
01:31:42,293 --> 01:31:44,961
and a bottle of wine
or something,

1798
01:31:44,963 --> 01:31:49,966
and he'll say, "I'm sorry. I don't
know what I done, but I'm sorry."

1799
01:31:49,968 --> 01:31:53,036
Vienetta already
had a daughter, Miriam,

1800
01:31:53,038 --> 01:31:56,239
and she and Simon
have a son - Daniel.

1801
01:31:59,376 --> 01:32:01,511
Is there anything of you in him?

1802
01:32:01,513 --> 01:32:04,847
His dashing good looks, yeah.

1803
01:32:04,849 --> 01:32:09,018
That's me and his love
of sport as well.

1804
01:32:09,020 --> 01:32:11,554
He goes to school in Slough,

1805
01:32:11,556 --> 01:32:13,923
because that's where
they do grammar schools.

1806
01:32:13,925 --> 01:32:16,159
He's doing very well there.

1807
01:32:16,161 --> 01:32:18,728
They say,
"Where's your father?"

1808
01:32:18,730 --> 01:32:22,065
"When your mum's out at work,
is there your father?"

1809
01:32:22,067 --> 01:32:24,500
And I just tell them
I ain't got one.

1810
01:32:24,502 --> 01:32:26,736
They've got everything.

1811
01:32:26,738 --> 01:32:31,207
They've even got
what I never had.

1812
01:32:31,209 --> 01:32:32,675
Which is what?

1813
01:32:32,677 --> 01:32:35,211
A father, innit, so, I mean,
they've had everything.

1814
01:32:35,213 --> 01:32:38,882
At one stage, they will stop
seeing me at all,

1815
01:32:38,884 --> 01:32:41,984
but now, bit older, bit wiser,

1816
01:32:41,986 --> 01:32:49,058
and I'm a bit older and wiser,
and now three of them see me.

1817
01:32:49,060 --> 01:32:52,128
Jessica has been
very busy herself.

1818
01:32:52,130 --> 01:32:54,563
She's got her work,
she's got college.

1819
01:32:54,565 --> 01:32:55,799
So who do you support?

1820
01:32:55,801 --> 01:32:58,401
Your lot comes second.

1821
01:32:58,403 --> 01:33:01,937
Jonathan's been
in transitional period

1822
01:33:01,939 --> 01:33:07,077
with changing jobs
and building up his new life.

1823
01:33:07,079 --> 01:33:12,816
The two that don't, I can't
really see their point of view.

1824
01:33:12,818 --> 01:33:15,752
So what's it like
being a grandfather?

1825
01:33:15,754 --> 01:33:17,553
Oh, it's bloody easy,
actually.

1826
01:33:17,555 --> 01:33:20,556
You can see them all day long
and then let them go back.

1827
01:33:20,558 --> 01:33:21,958
And you've got one?

1828
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:24,327
Two, actually.

1829
01:33:24,329 --> 01:33:26,362
One that I see

1830
01:33:26,364 --> 01:33:30,266
and one that I would only see
if I kept going round to see him.

1831
01:33:30,268 --> 01:33:36,806
Otherwise, I wouldn't see him, so I
am waiting for the return visit now.

1832
01:33:36,808 --> 01:33:41,277
Before I'm old enough
to get a job,

1833
01:33:41,279 --> 01:33:46,016
I'd just walk around
and see what I can find.

1834
01:33:46,018 --> 01:33:48,484
Was going to be a film star,

1835
01:33:48,486 --> 01:33:52,555
but now I'm going to be
an electrical engineer,

1836
01:33:52,557 --> 01:33:54,757
which is more to reality, really.

1837
01:33:54,759 --> 01:33:58,928
By 21, Simon was working
in the freezer room

1838
01:33:58,930 --> 01:34:00,363
of Walls Sausages in London.

1839
01:34:00,365 --> 01:34:02,465
I know I can't stay at Walls
forever.

1840
01:34:02,467 --> 01:34:04,234
This is just not me.

1841
01:34:04,236 --> 01:34:06,770
I couldn't stay there
for that long.

1842
01:34:06,772 --> 01:34:08,771
My mind would go dead.

1843
01:34:08,773 --> 01:34:11,040
I'm quite happy to stay there.

1844
01:34:11,042 --> 01:34:13,409
Doesn't look like
it's going to close down,

1845
01:34:13,411 --> 01:34:17,413
so, I mean, better the devil
you know, innit?

1846
01:34:17,415 --> 01:34:20,049
Walls did close the factory down.

1847
01:34:20,051 --> 01:34:25,422
Since then he has worked near
Heathrow airport handling freight.

1848
01:34:25,424 --> 01:34:27,623
The only reason
I really went there

1849
01:34:27,625 --> 01:34:31,661
was to work near to where my son was
going to school, so I could drop him off.

1850
01:34:34,398 --> 01:34:38,901
Do you feel you could have done
more with a career with your work?

1851
01:34:38,903 --> 01:34:41,571
If I had pushed myself at school,

1852
01:34:41,573 --> 01:34:44,874
probably I could have done
a lot better.

1853
01:34:44,876 --> 01:34:47,876
Does that give you
pause for thought?

1854
01:34:47,878 --> 01:34:51,081
No. That means I was a lazy sod
when I was younger.

1855
01:34:52,349 --> 01:34:55,151
Somebody once said that
you don't live to work,

1856
01:34:55,153 --> 01:34:57,954
you work to live,
and that's how it should be.

1857
01:34:57,956 --> 01:34:59,989
(woman) Obviously when children
come into foster care,

1858
01:34:59,991 --> 01:35:01,858
family and friends
are involved...

1859
01:35:01,860 --> 01:35:04,494
A couple of years ago,
Simon and Vienetta

1860
01:35:04,496 --> 01:35:06,929
decided to train
as foster parents.

1861
01:35:06,931 --> 01:35:09,632
Went to boarding school
when I was young,

1862
01:35:09,634 --> 01:35:13,369
and I always felt
that was regimental.

1863
01:35:13,371 --> 01:35:16,005
It didn't allow
for personal care,

1864
01:35:16,007 --> 01:35:18,808
for loving
from the adult carers,

1865
01:35:18,810 --> 01:35:21,378
so I wanted to do something
like that for myself,

1866
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:24,647
you know, in my own home.

1867
01:35:24,649 --> 01:35:26,316
And we always say
to foster carers,

1868
01:35:26,318 --> 01:35:27,984
please do not cut
the children's hair

1869
01:35:27,986 --> 01:35:30,286
without the permission
of the parents.

1870
01:35:30,288 --> 01:35:33,823
So what's the toughest thing
about being a foster parent?

1871
01:35:33,825 --> 01:35:37,126
You're taking a chance,
really, when you do it,

1872
01:35:37,128 --> 01:35:39,862
'cause you don't - you really
don't know what you're getting.

1873
01:35:39,864 --> 01:35:43,599
One child had two knives
in her hands,

1874
01:35:43,601 --> 01:35:46,603
because she didn't want
to stay in this country.

1875
01:35:46,605 --> 01:35:48,538
Two knives in her hands.

1876
01:35:48,540 --> 01:35:49,905
She threatened you?

1877
01:35:49,907 --> 01:35:51,741
No. She was just
a threat to herself.

1878
01:35:51,743 --> 01:35:53,509
Some of them come back.

1879
01:35:53,511 --> 01:35:55,878
They ring you up and say, "Hello,
auntie. Hello, uncle. How are you?"

1880
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:58,714
They come and have Sunday dinner,
come and visit us, which is good.

1881
01:35:58,716 --> 01:36:00,716
At least you know you've
made a little difference

1882
01:36:00,718 --> 01:36:03,620
to that child
or that person's life.

1883
01:36:03,622 --> 01:36:05,854
Obviously we have Heathrow
in our borough,

1884
01:36:05,856 --> 01:36:09,125
and that gives us extra things
that foster carers might need to do.

1885
01:36:09,127 --> 01:36:13,629
So where are these children coming
from that come to your house?

1886
01:36:13,631 --> 01:36:18,368
Oh, all over the world.
So anywhere. Anywhere.

1887
01:36:18,370 --> 01:36:22,372
When they come off the plane, they
expected to be meeting somebody,

1888
01:36:22,374 --> 01:36:25,642
but that person doesn't turn up.

1889
01:36:30,013 --> 01:36:31,747
Simon.
How you doing?

1890
01:36:31,749 --> 01:36:34,317
Simon had been at the
children's home with Paul,

1891
01:36:34,319 --> 01:36:38,554
so we brought Paul back
from Australia to reunite them.

1892
01:36:38,556 --> 01:36:41,057
Was it good, though?
Yeah.

1893
01:36:41,059 --> 01:36:44,060
You can see Windsor Castle
from their house.

1894
01:36:44,062 --> 01:36:45,962
Look at that.

1895
01:36:45,964 --> 01:36:48,565
We don't actually see each
other, touch each other,

1896
01:36:48,567 --> 01:36:50,566
but we're living
each other's lives.

1897
01:36:50,568 --> 01:36:52,835
Every seven years, it all
comes back, and this -

1898
01:36:52,837 --> 01:36:56,839
We get up to this far, and we've done
this, and you've done that, and...

1899
01:36:56,841 --> 01:36:59,275
When they were 21,

1900
01:36:59,277 --> 01:37:02,712
we took them back to where they had spent
some of their formative years together.

1901
01:37:04,548 --> 01:37:06,950
Remember him?
Yeah.

1902
01:37:06,952 --> 01:37:09,151
He was a real bastard.

1903
01:37:09,153 --> 01:37:12,121
I do try to be disciplined,

1904
01:37:12,123 --> 01:37:15,691
but I actually hate discipline.

1905
01:37:15,693 --> 01:37:18,794
I believe the school
has taught me that.

1906
01:37:18,796 --> 01:37:22,631
There's always been
a bit of turmoil inside.

1907
01:37:22,633 --> 01:37:25,702
I believe that divorce
affects children a lot.

1908
01:37:25,704 --> 01:37:29,872
See, I can get on well
with my mother sometimes.

1909
01:37:29,874 --> 01:37:32,742
We talk very well
with each other,

1910
01:37:32,744 --> 01:37:38,381
but it's sometimes
not quite as mother and son.

1911
01:37:38,383 --> 01:37:40,749
When he was 35,

1912
01:37:40,751 --> 01:37:43,052
Simon's mother died of cancer.

1913
01:37:43,054 --> 01:37:47,724
There was so many things I
never actually said to my mum,

1914
01:37:47,726 --> 01:37:50,726
just things you think
about afterwards.

1915
01:37:50,728 --> 01:37:54,063
It's too late, because
they're not there anymore.

1916
01:37:54,065 --> 01:37:57,433
What sort of things?

1917
01:37:57,435 --> 01:38:00,035
Just I love you every day,
you know.

1918
01:38:00,037 --> 01:38:03,673
Later on in life, I did realize
that she got depressed as well,

1919
01:38:03,675 --> 01:38:05,942
so that was probably
a bigger reason

1920
01:38:05,944 --> 01:38:08,311
than not being able
to look after me.

1921
01:38:08,313 --> 01:38:10,380
My mother wrote to me
when I was 21,

1922
01:38:10,382 --> 01:38:12,548
and I hadn't really
had any contact with her.

1923
01:38:12,550 --> 01:38:14,783
When I was 21,
she come out and visited,

1924
01:38:14,785 --> 01:38:16,852
but I did grow up without her,

1925
01:38:16,854 --> 01:38:19,455
so it was like looking
at a total stranger.

1926
01:38:19,457 --> 01:38:21,891
I didn't recognize her at all,

1927
01:38:21,893 --> 01:38:27,429
so there was no real
in-depth feeling there.

1928
01:38:27,431 --> 01:38:30,166
Paul, get in there
next to him as well.

1929
01:38:30,168 --> 01:38:32,235
Come on, let me
get you organized.

1930
01:38:32,237 --> 01:38:34,437
(Michael) Are these two guys
very alike?

1931
01:38:34,439 --> 01:38:37,440
I think they're alike, because they
don't seem to jump into things.

1932
01:38:37,442 --> 01:38:39,842
They'll stand back and
have a little look at it.

1933
01:38:39,844 --> 01:38:41,477
You make them enjoy themselves,

1934
01:38:41,479 --> 01:38:43,513
like when we went for a walk
around London yesterday,

1935
01:38:43,515 --> 01:38:45,581
I said, "You are coming, and you
are having a good time doing this,"

1936
01:38:45,583 --> 01:38:47,616
And he did have a good
time doing it, so...

1937
01:38:47,618 --> 01:38:50,419
They're both very
family-orientated,

1938
01:38:50,421 --> 01:38:54,590
and they both married noisy women.
That's true.

1939
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:55,658
(laughter)

1940
01:38:55,660 --> 01:38:56,993
That works for me.

1941
01:38:56,995 --> 01:38:58,695
I had one dream

1942
01:38:58,697 --> 01:39:01,798
when all the world
was on top of me,

1943
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:05,100
and everything was on,

1944
01:39:05,102 --> 01:39:10,205
and I just about got out,
and everything flew up in the air.

1945
01:39:10,207 --> 01:39:13,976
I still look up in the sky,
because I don't know any better.

1946
01:39:13,978 --> 01:39:17,113
Everything I have, I always think,

1947
01:39:17,115 --> 01:39:20,883
"Is that ok? Is that right
that I should have that?"

1948
01:39:20,885 --> 01:39:22,817
People are undecided about you.

1949
01:39:22,819 --> 01:39:27,356
They could be your friend
one day and not the next.

1950
01:39:27,358 --> 01:39:32,360
I wanted to be a boxer, actor,

1951
01:39:32,362 --> 01:39:35,463
but I never actually
really wanted them.

1952
01:39:35,465 --> 01:39:39,234
I just wanted to be liked.

1953
01:39:39,236 --> 01:39:42,003
Paul actually gets - that's all
he ever wants out of people

1954
01:39:42,005 --> 01:39:44,639
is just people to like him
for who he is and what he is

1955
01:39:44,641 --> 01:39:46,841
without having to put on
any false pretences.

1956
01:39:46,843 --> 01:39:49,177
I think that's why he doesn't
open himself up to people.

1957
01:39:49,179 --> 01:39:50,879
Hello, darling.

1958
01:39:50,881 --> 01:39:52,647
Hello.

1959
01:39:52,649 --> 01:39:55,484
(Michael) Do you have
any regrets, the two of you?

1960
01:39:55,486 --> 01:39:57,052
(Vienetta) Yes, I do.

1961
01:39:57,054 --> 01:39:59,621
That we didn't
get together earlier.

1962
01:39:59,623 --> 01:40:01,756
I think marriage
is good for me.

1963
01:40:01,758 --> 01:40:03,625
What does she give you?

1964
01:40:03,627 --> 01:40:06,527
Hot dinners and a warm bed.

1965
01:40:06,529 --> 01:40:09,431
(stammers and chuckles)

1966
01:40:09,433 --> 01:40:13,402
Uh, she gives me
a balance in my life,

1967
01:40:13,404 --> 01:40:16,337
because... On my own,

1968
01:40:16,339 --> 01:40:19,974
I would probably be
your typical slob.

1969
01:40:21,411 --> 01:40:24,646
Men behaving badly.

1970
01:40:24,648 --> 01:40:28,717
We do get things done,
and we do things together.

1971
01:40:28,719 --> 01:40:31,085
'Cause you multiplied before,
so now you divide...

1972
01:40:31,087 --> 01:40:35,924
Is it tough for the two of you
being in these films?

1973
01:40:35,926 --> 01:40:40,229
I will say that I do love
watching everybody else.

1974
01:40:40,231 --> 01:40:42,296
I always hated them,
to be honest.

1975
01:40:42,298 --> 01:40:45,167
By the end of it,
I normally hate you.

1976
01:40:45,169 --> 01:40:49,338
Direct all of my anger
in one place. (laughs)

1977
01:40:49,340 --> 01:40:52,173
I read the Financial Times.

1978
01:40:52,175 --> 01:40:54,977
I read the Observer
and the Times.

1979
01:40:54,979 --> 01:40:57,245
What do you like about it?

1980
01:40:57,247 --> 01:40:59,080
Well, I like -

1981
01:40:59,082 --> 01:41:03,017
I usually look at the headlines
and then read about it.

1982
01:41:03,019 --> 01:41:06,088
(all singing)

1983
01:41:06,090 --> 01:41:09,024
At seven years old,
John, Andrew and Charles

1984
01:41:09,026 --> 01:41:12,394
were in a private
preparatory school in London.

1985
01:41:15,431 --> 01:41:17,932
What's the point of the program?

1986
01:41:17,934 --> 01:41:21,003
It's that the point of the program
is to reach a comparison.

1987
01:41:21,005 --> 01:41:23,004
I don't think it is,

1988
01:41:23,006 --> 01:41:26,375
because we're not necessarily
typical examples.

1989
01:41:26,377 --> 01:41:28,709
And I think that's what people
seeing the program might think.

1990
01:41:28,711 --> 01:41:30,411
Yes.
Falsely.

1991
01:41:30,413 --> 01:41:32,413
That's one of the troubles
with this sort of program.

1992
01:41:32,415 --> 01:41:34,616
I don't really think
that people like us -

1993
01:41:34,618 --> 01:41:36,918
Unless we are being seven
and being rather funny -

1994
01:41:36,920 --> 01:41:39,288
Have very much to say
that's very interesting,

1995
01:41:39,290 --> 01:41:42,324
'cause...
We don't know very much.

1996
01:41:42,326 --> 01:41:44,759
We didn't know very much
when we were seven,

1997
01:41:44,761 --> 01:41:46,595
but we were still quite funny.

1998
01:41:46,597 --> 01:41:49,597
(Michael) What do you think
about girlfriends at your age?

1999
01:41:49,599 --> 01:41:52,668
I've got one, but I don't
think much of her.

2000
01:41:52,670 --> 01:41:55,437
They're no longer just bores

2001
01:41:55,439 --> 01:41:57,973
who won't play this or something.

2002
01:41:57,975 --> 01:42:01,209
They're the other half of the
community, and they're there.

2003
01:42:01,211 --> 01:42:03,911
You can begin to talk to them.

2004
01:42:03,913 --> 01:42:06,381
I don't think I financially
come from the same background,

2005
01:42:06,383 --> 01:42:10,251
and Andrew didn't go
for a haughty deb,

2006
01:42:10,253 --> 01:42:13,254
he went for a good
Yorkshire lass,

2007
01:42:13,256 --> 01:42:15,490
But, I mean, obviously
he knew what he wanted.

2008
01:42:15,492 --> 01:42:18,427
(Michael) Does money
concern you a lot?

2009
01:42:18,429 --> 01:42:21,062
No. I think as long as one
has enough to be comfortable,

2010
01:42:21,064 --> 01:42:24,999
that's really
what one should aim for.

2011
01:42:25,001 --> 01:42:27,235
What's the most
difficult thing

2012
01:42:27,237 --> 01:42:29,304
about keeping
the marriage together?

2013
01:42:29,306 --> 01:42:31,506
I don't think it is particularly
difficult, actually.

2014
01:42:31,508 --> 01:42:35,610
We seem to manage all right,
would you say?

2015
01:42:35,612 --> 01:42:38,112
I think so.
We talk, don't we?

2016
01:42:38,114 --> 01:42:40,816
So how is married life?

2017
01:42:40,818 --> 01:42:44,919
Well, I still love him,
if that's what you're asking.

2018
01:42:44,921 --> 01:42:48,089
And likewise. (laughs)

2019
01:42:48,091 --> 01:42:50,625
I am going to charterhouse,

2020
01:42:50,627 --> 01:42:56,831
and after that,
Trinity Hall, Cambridge.

2021
01:42:56,833 --> 01:43:01,602
Andrew went to Charterhouse and
Cambridge, where he read law.

2022
01:43:01,604 --> 01:43:06,708
I'd like to be a solicitor
and also fairly successful.

2023
01:43:06,710 --> 01:43:10,379
At 28, Andrew was a solicitor.

2024
01:43:10,381 --> 01:43:14,649
What qualities do you think
it needs to be successful?

2025
01:43:14,651 --> 01:43:18,620
Well, you have to have a legal
ability in my business, obviously.

2026
01:43:18,622 --> 01:43:22,657
By 35, he had become a partner.

2027
01:43:22,659 --> 01:43:26,260
In a couple of weeks, we are going to
be having our legal conference in Dublin.

2028
01:43:26,262 --> 01:43:29,398
At 49, Andrew has left
the law firm.

2029
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:32,000
I've moved to a large
industrial gasses company

2030
01:43:32,002 --> 01:43:36,204
which makes oxygen and nitrogen,
hydrogen, things like that.

2031
01:43:36,206 --> 01:43:38,240
Were you taking a chance?

2032
01:43:38,242 --> 01:43:43,044
Yes. I've been at the same
firm for over 20 years,

2033
01:43:43,046 --> 01:43:46,381
but it's not very challenging,

2034
01:43:46,383 --> 01:43:48,082
and changing like this,

2035
01:43:48,084 --> 01:43:51,752
particularly quite late in your
career, sort of stretches you.

2036
01:43:51,754 --> 01:43:55,057
I think it's not a bad idea
to pay for school,

2037
01:43:55,059 --> 01:43:57,058
because if we didn't,

2038
01:43:57,060 --> 01:43:59,494
schools would be
so nasty and crowded.

2039
01:43:59,496 --> 01:44:01,329
Yes.

2040
01:44:01,331 --> 01:44:05,333
So do I think so, and the people
in the schools wouldn't -

2041
01:44:05,335 --> 01:44:07,702
And the people - poor people
would come rushing in.

2042
01:44:07,704 --> 01:44:12,573
The man in charge of the school
would get very angry,

2043
01:44:12,575 --> 01:44:14,876
because he would...
And he'd get bankrupt.

2044
01:44:14,878 --> 01:44:18,012
...He wouldn't be able
to pay all the masters

2045
01:44:18,014 --> 01:44:20,181
if he didn't get any money.

2046
01:44:20,183 --> 01:44:22,250
Education is very important.

2047
01:44:22,252 --> 01:44:24,719
I mean, you can never be sure

2048
01:44:24,721 --> 01:44:29,123
of leaving your children
any worldly goods,

2049
01:44:29,125 --> 01:44:32,693
but at least you can be sure that once
you've given them a good education,

2050
01:44:32,695 --> 01:44:35,630
that's something
that no one can take away.

2051
01:44:35,632 --> 01:44:38,165
Andrew and Jane
have two sons -

2052
01:44:38,167 --> 01:44:41,136
Alexander and Timothy.

2053
01:44:42,504 --> 01:44:45,307
Alexander's at university.

2054
01:44:45,309 --> 01:44:49,110
He's in his first year at Newcastle,
and Timothy's at boarding school.

2055
01:44:50,446 --> 01:44:52,380
I think he'd like to go
to university,

2056
01:44:52,382 --> 01:44:54,749
but I think that's
as far as he's got, really.

2057
01:44:54,751 --> 01:44:57,752
Maybe even over the summer holidays,
we might start to talk to him about,

2058
01:44:57,754 --> 01:45:00,388
are there any universities
he would like to go and look at?

2059
01:45:01,690 --> 01:45:04,525
Andrew and Jane live in London,

2060
01:45:04,527 --> 01:45:08,162
but they have a second home
in the country.

2061
01:45:08,164 --> 01:45:11,199
Well, we bought it about -
just when we got married.

2062
01:45:11,201 --> 01:45:14,803
It was a 200-year-old barn
that we bought in an auction,

2063
01:45:14,805 --> 01:45:16,538
completely derelict,

2064
01:45:16,540 --> 01:45:19,707
nothing in it all
except for manure,

2065
01:45:19,709 --> 01:45:24,612
and then, slowly over the years,
we've just been converting it,

2066
01:45:24,614 --> 01:45:27,615
but it's really taken us up until
fairly recently to do that.

2067
01:45:27,617 --> 01:45:29,918
Ollie, come on.

2068
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:32,954
There's a railway line that runs
along the bottom of our land.

2069
01:45:32,956 --> 01:45:38,526
There's a foxes' den down there.
We've been seeing a few cubs recently.

2070
01:45:38,528 --> 01:45:43,598
(Michael) What sort of hobbies
does Alexander enjoy?

2071
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:45,900
Well, on the odd occasion,

2072
01:45:45,902 --> 01:45:48,736
he's quite keen on doing
what we call dangerous sports.

2073
01:45:50,206 --> 01:45:53,107
And we're going to treat him
to a balloon ride

2074
01:45:53,109 --> 01:45:55,610
sort of in advance
of his birthday,

2075
01:45:55,612 --> 01:45:57,612
which is coming up soon.

2076
01:45:57,614 --> 01:45:59,280
(man) Here we go.
See you all.

2077
01:45:59,282 --> 01:46:01,082
See you later.

2078
01:46:03,585 --> 01:46:06,254
I have actually been
in a balloon once myself.

2079
01:46:06,256 --> 01:46:08,289
It was for
my father's birthday,

2080
01:46:08,291 --> 01:46:10,558
and it was all going
very well until the end,

2081
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:12,827
when we managed
to hit some trees and...

2082
01:46:12,829 --> 01:46:14,762
Don't tell me that now.

2083
01:46:14,764 --> 01:46:17,799
We landed on the basket.
We landed on its side.

2084
01:46:17,801 --> 01:46:21,035
(Alexander)
It's very high. Very high.

2085
01:46:21,037 --> 01:46:25,406
When we landed,
there was a request that...

2086
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:28,576
All the ladies go downwind

2087
01:46:28,578 --> 01:46:32,113
so that we could
land on top of them.

2088
01:46:32,115 --> 01:46:34,582
Once I had a talk to Greville.

2089
01:46:34,584 --> 01:46:39,554
He was in my house,
and I asked

2090
01:46:39,556 --> 01:46:42,057
if he could put him
out of my house,

2091
01:46:42,059 --> 01:46:44,626
because he was
always getting minuses.

2092
01:46:44,628 --> 01:46:48,395
(Michael) Do you think life is
tougher out there for your children

2093
01:46:48,397 --> 01:46:50,865
than it was for you?

2094
01:46:50,867 --> 01:46:54,335
Yes, certainly I think it's much
more competitive for children.

2095
01:46:54,337 --> 01:46:59,140
When I leave this school, I go
to Broadstairs, St. Peter's court.

2096
01:46:59,142 --> 01:47:02,477
If you look back at us sitting
on the settee at the age of seven,

2097
01:47:02,479 --> 01:47:07,281
and I was saying what I going to do,
as if my life was mapped out for me.

2098
01:47:07,283 --> 01:47:10,718
Trinity Hall, Cambridge.

2099
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:12,653
You know, you could never
get a child doing that now,

2100
01:47:12,655 --> 01:47:14,522
saying, "I'm going
to go to Cambridge."

2101
01:47:14,524 --> 01:47:16,557
Things have become
less certain as a result.

2102
01:47:16,559 --> 01:47:20,795
And you three on that settee
had huge opportunity.

2103
01:47:20,797 --> 01:47:22,964
We did.
Absolutely, yeah.

2104
01:47:22,966 --> 01:47:28,302
Well, I think boarding
makes you feel self-sufficient

2105
01:47:28,304 --> 01:47:32,474
and also teaches you to be away from
your parents and to live with people.

2106
01:47:32,476 --> 01:47:35,176
And who was the big
influence in your life

2107
01:47:35,178 --> 01:47:37,579
in giving you a sense
of proportion and value?

2108
01:47:37,581 --> 01:47:39,948
Well, obviously
it's your parents.

2109
01:47:39,950 --> 01:47:43,885
You know, they bring you up for
the first 18 years of your life.

2110
01:47:43,887 --> 01:47:47,721
Well, I have my bath
at 6:00 and then...

2111
01:47:47,723 --> 01:47:50,925
Do you ever look back
and think

2112
01:47:50,927 --> 01:47:54,896
is there anything you would like to
have been different from what it was?

2113
01:47:54,898 --> 01:47:57,231
I think, from my point
of view, perhaps,

2114
01:47:57,233 --> 01:47:59,233
as the children were growing up,

2115
01:47:59,235 --> 01:48:01,602
I would liked to have spent a bit
more time at home with them

2116
01:48:01,604 --> 01:48:05,707
rather than in the office, but that's
something that it's too late to do now.

2117
01:48:05,709 --> 01:48:08,542
So everything we say,
they'll think,

2118
01:48:08,544 --> 01:48:13,047
"Oh, that's a typical result
of the public-school system."

2119
01:48:13,049 --> 01:48:16,050
When we were 7 and 14 and 21,

2120
01:48:16,052 --> 01:48:18,686
we were fairly prepared
to say what we thought,

2121
01:48:18,688 --> 01:48:23,457
but we have become
more guarded over the years.

2122
01:48:23,459 --> 01:48:26,060
What are you guarded about?

2123
01:48:26,062 --> 01:48:28,630
I'm guarded
about being guarded.

2124
01:48:31,066 --> 01:48:33,668
Here we go. Ooh.

2125
01:48:33,670 --> 01:48:36,203
(Michael) So did you ever
fall on the ladies?

2126
01:48:36,205 --> 01:48:38,606
No. The lady fell on me.

2127
01:48:38,608 --> 01:48:40,842
But it was my wife,
so that was good.

2128
01:48:40,844 --> 01:48:42,777
(both laugh)

2129
01:48:42,779 --> 01:48:46,514
When I leave school, I am going
to the dragon school -

2130
01:48:46,516 --> 01:48:51,051
I might - and mum is,
and I might go -

2131
01:48:51,053 --> 01:48:55,156
After, I might go to
Charterhouse, Marlborough.

2132
01:48:55,158 --> 01:48:59,393
I don't particularly want to be rich,
but I'd like to have enough money.

2133
01:48:59,395 --> 01:49:01,496
Charles went to Marlborough

2134
01:49:01,498 --> 01:49:03,598
and then onto Durham University.

2135
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:08,569
Since 21, he's taken no
further part in these films.

2136
01:49:08,571 --> 01:49:16,144
When I leave this school,
I'm going to Colet Court,

2137
01:49:16,146 --> 01:49:19,280
and then I will be going
to Westminster boarding school

2138
01:49:19,282 --> 01:49:21,916
if I pass the exam,

2139
01:49:21,918 --> 01:49:27,355
and then we think I'm going to
Cambridge and Trinity Hall.

2140
01:49:29,758 --> 01:49:31,792
John went to Westminster,

2141
01:49:31,794 --> 01:49:36,764
then onto read law
at Christ Church, Oxford.

2142
01:49:36,766 --> 01:49:40,668
I'm thinking of following
a legal career

2143
01:49:40,670 --> 01:49:43,671
with a view
to ending in parliament.

2144
01:49:43,673 --> 01:49:46,808
Might be at the bar.

2145
01:49:46,810 --> 01:49:49,210
(Michael) Doing what?

2146
01:49:49,212 --> 01:49:50,745
Perhaps chancery practice.

2147
01:49:50,747 --> 01:49:53,414
I now have a career.
I'm a barrister.

2148
01:49:53,416 --> 01:49:55,950
Other than that,

2149
01:49:55,952 --> 01:49:58,285
life chugs along
in varying degrees.

2150
01:49:58,287 --> 01:50:02,189
Well, in a sense, not very much has changed
in my career over the last 14 years.

2151
01:50:02,191 --> 01:50:05,459
I'm still a barrister.
I still wear a curly white wig.

2152
01:50:05,461 --> 01:50:08,396
The only visible difference,
I suppose,

2153
01:50:08,398 --> 01:50:11,265
is I wear a silk gown,
because I am now a QC.

2154
01:50:11,267 --> 01:50:13,100
(Michael) Are you ambitious?

2155
01:50:13,102 --> 01:50:14,602
Yes.

2156
01:50:14,604 --> 01:50:16,137
What for?

2157
01:50:16,139 --> 01:50:19,240
Fame and power.

2158
01:50:20,642 --> 01:50:22,877
What sort of power?

2159
01:50:22,879 --> 01:50:24,779
Political power.

2160
01:50:24,781 --> 01:50:26,781
I would quite like
to go into politics,

2161
01:50:26,783 --> 01:50:29,117
but, I mean, that's
easier said than done.

2162
01:50:31,419 --> 01:50:34,122
I have actually thought about
whether I shouldn't try

2163
01:50:34,124 --> 01:50:38,159
and get myself onto
the candidates' list,

2164
01:50:38,161 --> 01:50:40,528
but who knows?

2165
01:50:40,530 --> 01:50:44,532
I haven't written myself off
as a potential politician,

2166
01:50:44,534 --> 01:50:46,934
even though I am already 49.

2167
01:50:49,137 --> 01:50:51,806
I worry about the quality
of our democracy.

2168
01:50:51,808 --> 01:50:56,310
I worry in particular
about this government,

2169
01:50:56,312 --> 01:50:59,413
not because they're socialists
and they're to round us all up

2170
01:50:59,415 --> 01:51:02,116
and take us off to Trafalgar
Square in tumbrels

2171
01:51:02,118 --> 01:51:04,352
to face the guillotine.

2172
01:51:04,354 --> 01:51:06,053
Far from it.

2173
01:51:06,055 --> 01:51:09,357
In fact, Tony Blair is a very
good conservative, as I see it,

2174
01:51:09,359 --> 01:51:12,793
but rather because
of the insidious damage

2175
01:51:12,795 --> 01:51:14,929
they're doing
to our constitution.

2176
01:51:14,931 --> 01:51:20,034
Rich children always make fun
of poor children, I think.

2177
01:51:20,036 --> 01:51:22,036
It's very irresponsible,

2178
01:51:22,038 --> 01:51:24,305
because we all want more money,
as much money as we can get.

2179
01:51:24,307 --> 01:51:27,174
The acquisition of sacks
and sacks of money

2180
01:51:27,176 --> 01:51:31,078
is not something that
I set much importance by.

2181
01:51:31,080 --> 01:51:34,915
I'm not money-minded,
I would say, in that sense.

2182
01:51:34,917 --> 01:51:37,852
I mean, obviously it's nice
to have a fair amount of money,

2183
01:51:37,854 --> 01:51:41,622
and money does enable you
to go on nice holidays,

2184
01:51:41,624 --> 01:51:43,558
buy nice things,

2185
01:51:43,560 --> 01:51:47,095
so on and so forth,
but as a goal in itself, no.

2186
01:51:47,097 --> 01:51:50,932
I mean, who wants to be the
richest corpse in the graveyard?

2187
01:51:50,934 --> 01:51:54,135
By the time he was 35,

2188
01:51:54,137 --> 01:51:56,971
John had a house in London
and another in the country.

2189
01:51:56,973 --> 01:51:59,574
I seem to spend an awful lot
of my time gardening furiously,

2190
01:51:59,576 --> 01:52:02,810
trying to tame the wilderness
that we inherited there.

2191
01:52:02,812 --> 01:52:05,546
I'd have laughed if, ten years
ago, you'd have told me

2192
01:52:05,548 --> 01:52:08,249
that I would spend
most of my time

2193
01:52:08,251 --> 01:52:11,052
digging herbaceous borders
and things,

2194
01:52:11,054 --> 01:52:14,221
but that's what I seem to do,
and I enjoy it.

2195
01:52:14,223 --> 01:52:17,292
One good thing about having quite
a large house in the country now

2196
01:52:17,294 --> 01:52:20,595
is that I have taken up
playing the piano.

2197
01:52:20,597 --> 01:52:22,730
It's a very nonchalant
little theme,

2198
01:52:22,732 --> 01:52:24,765
butter wouldn't melt
in its mouth,

2199
01:52:24,767 --> 01:52:29,470
so take it very quietly
and let it present itself. Off.

2200
01:52:29,472 --> 01:52:32,339
A couple of years ago, I did
start again and even practicing,

2201
01:52:32,341 --> 01:52:36,243
but I am afraid I've lost
an awful lot of dexterity.

2202
01:52:46,822 --> 01:52:48,823
Whether it's old age
and arthritis,

2203
01:52:48,825 --> 01:52:51,024
or whether it's falling off
horses too many times,

2204
01:52:51,026 --> 01:52:54,561
I don't know, but, I mean, I don't feel
I've got quite the dexterity in my fingers.

2205
01:52:57,266 --> 01:52:59,634
Certainly I can never tell the
difference between you playing

2206
01:52:59,636 --> 01:53:02,202
and the CD playing
when I'm out of the room.

2207
01:53:02,204 --> 01:53:03,871
Yeah, very good, very good.

2208
01:53:03,873 --> 01:53:06,407
Well, she's very diplomatic.
No, no.

2209
01:53:06,409 --> 01:53:10,444
When boys go round with girls, they don't
pay attention to what they're doing.

2210
01:53:10,446 --> 01:53:14,582
My grandmother had an accident
because a boyfriend

2211
01:53:14,584 --> 01:53:17,518
was kissing his girlfriend
in the street.

2212
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:22,857
By 35, John had married Claire,

2213
01:53:22,859 --> 01:53:25,959
the daughter of a former
ambassador to Bulgaria.

2214
01:53:25,961 --> 01:53:28,996
It is coincidental
that we met,

2215
01:53:28,998 --> 01:53:32,299
but it's obvious
that the Balkan connection

2216
01:53:32,301 --> 01:53:35,370
was a strong mutual interest.

2217
01:53:38,574 --> 01:53:40,408
(speaking Bulgarian)

2218
01:53:40,410 --> 01:53:44,811
We have a charity,
friends of Bulgaria,

2219
01:53:44,813 --> 01:53:48,049
which started in 1991,

2220
01:53:48,051 --> 01:53:50,584
which actually made
quite a lot of money

2221
01:53:50,586 --> 01:53:52,987
which we invested in medicine
and took out to Bulgaria.

2222
01:53:52,989 --> 01:53:55,690
We support some children's homes
in Starazagora,

2223
01:53:55,692 --> 01:53:58,526
an institution
for disabled children,

2224
01:53:58,528 --> 01:54:01,195
and we make donations
to other charities.

2225
01:54:01,197 --> 01:54:05,299
People who go on about the government
butchering the national health service

2226
01:54:05,301 --> 01:54:07,434
I think should come
over to Bulgaria

2227
01:54:07,436 --> 01:54:11,639
to see what being kept short
of necessary supplies and funds

2228
01:54:11,641 --> 01:54:13,808
really does mean.

2229
01:54:13,810 --> 01:54:16,276
We've been told
that in some places,

2230
01:54:16,278 --> 01:54:18,412
it's impossible
to do even operations,

2231
01:54:18,414 --> 01:54:20,714
albeit they have
the operating theatres

2232
01:54:20,716 --> 01:54:23,451
and they have excellent doctors,
for want of simple anaesthetics.

2233
01:54:23,453 --> 01:54:26,353
Up till then,
there'd been no provision

2234
01:54:26,355 --> 01:54:29,657
for education
of disabled children,

2235
01:54:29,659 --> 01:54:33,995
so we started
what was called a paralleca,

2236
01:54:33,997 --> 01:54:36,730
which is parallel education
for the disabled,

2237
01:54:36,732 --> 01:54:40,268
and we've now got
two classes here.

2238
01:54:40,270 --> 01:54:42,536
My name Deanna.

2239
01:54:42,538 --> 01:54:44,839
Cristo Christoff.

2240
01:54:46,675 --> 01:54:49,843
Claire and I
have been giving prizes

2241
01:54:49,845 --> 01:54:52,045
to the most talented
children in this town.

2242
01:54:52,047 --> 01:54:54,849
The school that we're in

2243
01:54:54,851 --> 01:54:59,120
was actually built by my family
at the end of the 19th century.

2244
01:54:59,122 --> 01:55:02,689
And they also used
to present prizes

2245
01:55:02,691 --> 01:55:04,758
to the best children
from the school each year

2246
01:55:04,760 --> 01:55:09,530
right until the advent
of communism in 1944.

2247
01:55:09,532 --> 01:55:12,933
I come from a very old family

2248
01:55:12,935 --> 01:55:16,470
with big traditions of
service to this country,

2249
01:55:16,472 --> 01:55:19,273
and, really, when I come here,

2250
01:55:19,275 --> 01:55:21,809
I feel very proud of them,

2251
01:55:21,811 --> 01:55:24,545
because I feel, in so many ways,
they've helped build Bulgaria.

2252
01:55:26,081 --> 01:55:28,482
This church is quite interesting.

2253
01:55:28,484 --> 01:55:30,417
It was built by

2254
01:55:30,419 --> 01:55:34,855
my great-great-great
grandfather in 1835.

2255
01:55:34,857 --> 01:55:38,092
They say he made off
with 8 tons of gold,

2256
01:55:38,094 --> 01:55:39,894
and even today,

2257
01:55:39,896 --> 01:55:41,895
the mountains here are
full of treasure hunters

2258
01:55:41,897 --> 01:55:44,398
who keep digging up all
the caves and everything

2259
01:55:44,400 --> 01:55:46,367
in the hope of
finding the treasure.

2260
01:55:46,369 --> 01:55:48,335
I wish I could find it.

2261
01:55:48,337 --> 01:55:51,805
I mean, once I'd refunded
my equitable life pension fund,

2262
01:55:51,807 --> 01:55:55,776
I reckon if I shoot the horses,
shoot the wife

2263
01:55:55,778 --> 01:55:59,780
and only drink Bulgarian wine,

2264
01:55:59,782 --> 01:56:04,118
I may be able to retire
age 94 or something.

2265
01:56:04,120 --> 01:56:07,988
Straw Macanessy got
three minuses in a day.

2266
01:56:07,990 --> 01:56:09,890
He's a pest.

2267
01:56:09,892 --> 01:56:12,526
It has to be said
that I bitterly regret

2268
01:56:12,528 --> 01:56:15,796
that the headmaster of the school
where I was when I was seven

2269
01:56:15,798 --> 01:56:18,032
pushed me forward for this series,

2270
01:56:18,034 --> 01:56:19,900
'cause every seven years,

2271
01:56:19,902 --> 01:56:24,838
a little pill of poison is
injected into - (Claire) Oh, no.

2272
01:56:24,840 --> 01:56:27,040
Well, it's the truth.

2273
01:56:27,042 --> 01:56:30,111
There are times when I have
felt appearing on this

2274
01:56:30,113 --> 01:56:33,947
may get causes near to my
heart a bit of publicity

2275
01:56:33,949 --> 01:56:39,020
and certainly when you came to
Bulgaria for the 35Up program,

2276
01:56:39,022 --> 01:56:42,556
that did lead to us getting
quite significant assistance,

2277
01:56:42,558 --> 01:56:45,125
which possibly we
wouldn't have got.

2278
01:56:45,127 --> 01:56:48,229
Well, I think it's
a very good system.

2279
01:56:48,231 --> 01:56:50,398
I suspect that why this program

2280
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:52,399
is compelling and
interesting for viewers,

2281
01:56:52,401 --> 01:56:55,035
and I quite see why it is,
is because, really,

2282
01:56:55,037 --> 01:56:59,273
it's like big brother or I'm
a celebrity, get me out of here!

2283
01:56:59,275 --> 01:57:01,775
It is actually real-life TV

2284
01:57:01,777 --> 01:57:05,379
and with the added bonus that
you can see people grow old,

2285
01:57:05,381 --> 01:57:07,447
lose their hair, get fat.

2286
01:57:07,449 --> 01:57:11,018
Fascinating, I'm sure,
but does it have any value?

2287
01:57:11,020 --> 01:57:12,886
That's a different question.

2288
01:57:16,258 --> 01:57:19,226
Well, we pretend we've got swords,

2289
01:57:19,228 --> 01:57:21,896
and we make the noise
of the swords fighting,

2290
01:57:21,898 --> 01:57:25,065
and once somebody stabs us,
we go, "Ahhhh."

2291
01:57:25,067 --> 01:57:28,001
Neil grew up in a Liverpool suburb.

2292
01:57:28,003 --> 01:57:30,370
He had dreams of going to Oxford,

2293
01:57:30,372 --> 01:57:32,640
but didn't get in.

2294
01:57:32,642 --> 01:57:34,876
Instead, he went
to Aberdeen University,

2295
01:57:34,878 --> 01:57:38,379
but dropped out
after the first term.

2296
01:57:38,381 --> 01:57:42,483
At 21, he was working
on a building site

2297
01:57:42,485 --> 01:57:44,885
and living in a squat.

2298
01:57:44,887 --> 01:57:47,555
I would like to be somebody
in a position of importance,

2299
01:57:47,557 --> 01:57:49,557
I have always thought,

2300
01:57:49,559 --> 01:57:52,058
but I don't think
I'm the right sort of person

2301
01:57:52,060 --> 01:57:55,229
to carry the responsibility
for whatever it is.

2302
01:57:55,231 --> 01:57:57,697
I always thought
"Well I'd love to be...

2303
01:57:57,699 --> 01:58:03,570
Possibly love to be in politics
or something like this."

2304
01:58:03,572 --> 01:58:06,006
By 28, he was homeless,

2305
01:58:06,008 --> 01:58:09,910
wandering around
the west coast of Scotland.

2306
01:58:09,912 --> 01:58:13,714
If the money runs out, well, then, for
a few days, there's nowhere to go to,

2307
01:58:13,716 --> 01:58:15,716
and that's all you can do.

2308
01:58:15,718 --> 01:58:19,220
I simply have to find
the warmest shed I can find.

2309
01:58:19,222 --> 01:58:23,024
(Michael) How do people
regard you here?

2310
01:58:23,026 --> 01:58:25,959
Well, I'm still known
as an eccentric.

2311
01:58:29,097 --> 01:58:31,365
I'm not claiming
that I feel as though

2312
01:58:31,367 --> 01:58:34,702
I am in some sort
of nirvana,

2313
01:58:34,704 --> 01:58:38,605
but I am claiming that if I was
living in a bedsit in suburbia,

2314
01:58:38,607 --> 01:58:42,309
I'd be so miserable, I'd
feel like cutting my throat.

2315
01:58:42,311 --> 01:58:45,612
At 35, we found him
living in a council estate

2316
01:58:45,614 --> 01:58:47,814
on the most northerly
part of Britain -

2317
01:58:47,816 --> 01:58:49,616
The Shetland Islands.

2318
01:58:49,618 --> 01:58:51,752
It's an environment
which sustains me,

2319
01:58:51,754 --> 01:58:54,488
it's one in which
I can survive.

2320
01:58:54,490 --> 01:58:56,524
The reason I don't feel safe

2321
01:58:56,526 --> 01:58:59,526
is because I think I am getting
more and more used to this lifestyle,

2322
01:58:59,528 --> 01:59:04,264
which, eventually,
I shall have to give up.

2323
01:59:04,266 --> 01:59:08,168
And what would you like to be
doing, say, in seven years?

2324
01:59:08,170 --> 01:59:10,304
I can think of all kinds of
things I'd like to be doing.

2325
01:59:10,306 --> 01:59:15,976
The real question is,
"What am I likely to be doing?"

2326
01:59:15,978 --> 01:59:17,778
Um...

2327
01:59:19,881 --> 01:59:22,850
What are you likely to be doing?

2328
01:59:22,852 --> 01:59:25,552
That's a horrible question.

2329
01:59:25,554 --> 01:59:28,289
I tend to think
the most likely answer

2330
01:59:28,291 --> 01:59:30,290
is that I'll be
wandering homeless

2331
01:59:30,292 --> 01:59:32,293
round the streets of London,

2332
01:59:32,295 --> 01:59:34,828
but with a bit of luck,
that won't happen.

2333
01:59:39,301 --> 01:59:43,336
Can I just point out some of
the considerable disadvantages?

2334
01:59:43,338 --> 01:59:45,672
First of all,
they are geographically...

2335
01:59:45,674 --> 01:59:48,542
By 42, Neil had moved to London

2336
01:59:48,544 --> 01:59:52,046
and was a liberal democrat
on Hackney Council.

2337
01:59:52,048 --> 01:59:54,181
While I was in Shetland,
I felt very strongly

2338
01:59:54,183 --> 01:59:56,817
that I should become
involved in politics,

2339
01:59:56,819 --> 01:59:58,819
simply because I felt I
was not achieving anything

2340
01:59:58,821 --> 02:00:01,221
in the ways I really -
I really wanted to.

2341
02:00:05,694 --> 02:00:09,896
(Michael) So, didn't expect
to see you driving, Neil.

2342
02:00:09,898 --> 02:00:13,333
Well, neither - if you'd asked
me that question a few years ago,

2343
02:00:13,335 --> 02:00:16,036
I would have been surprised,

2344
02:00:16,038 --> 02:00:19,105
but it was my brother's wife's car,

2345
02:00:19,107 --> 02:00:22,609
and fortunately, she was about
to change vehicles at the time,

2346
02:00:22,611 --> 02:00:25,279
and they let me have it
without charge,

2347
02:00:25,281 --> 02:00:29,883
which was really
a very magnanimous gesture.

2348
02:00:29,885 --> 02:00:32,653
At 49, Neil has left London,

2349
02:00:32,655 --> 02:00:36,156
moved to Cumbria in
the north west of England

2350
02:00:36,158 --> 02:00:38,692
and become a member of
the local district council.

2351
02:00:38,694 --> 02:00:41,061
(man) ...Fairly simple.

2352
02:00:41,063 --> 02:00:43,163
It was a committee decision,
majority decision.

2353
02:00:43,165 --> 02:00:46,967
His own group on the establishment
committee agreed with the decision.

2354
02:00:46,969 --> 02:00:49,136
Councillor Hughes.

2355
02:00:49,138 --> 02:00:51,171
Well, for councillor Niland's
information -

2356
02:00:51,173 --> 02:00:55,975
Councillor Cook has reconsidered his
opinion he ventured at that meeting.

2357
02:00:55,977 --> 02:00:57,978
I'm a liberal democrat,

2358
02:00:57,980 --> 02:01:00,681
I'm standing for the county
council for this seat,

2359
02:01:00,683 --> 02:01:04,017
which is 400 square miles in size,

2360
02:01:04,019 --> 02:01:06,687
so it's a huge,
a huge constituency,

2361
02:01:06,689 --> 02:01:09,590
and this is only one
of the 84 seats.

2362
02:01:09,592 --> 02:01:11,191
Who has the seat
at the moment?

2363
02:01:11,193 --> 02:01:13,660
It's a conservative councillor
at the moment.

2364
02:01:13,662 --> 02:01:15,028
Big majority?

2365
02:01:15,030 --> 02:01:17,598
Significant. There's a lot
of work for me to do,

2366
02:01:17,600 --> 02:01:19,567
if not this time,
maybe next time.

2367
02:01:19,569 --> 02:01:21,602
What are the chances this time?

2368
02:01:21,604 --> 02:01:23,137
I'm doing my best.

2369
02:01:24,605 --> 02:01:27,241
Funnily enough,
when I first came up here,

2370
02:01:27,243 --> 02:01:29,943
I was considering
giving it up altogether,

2371
02:01:29,945 --> 02:01:34,748
but after only about two days,
I just got involved again,

2372
02:01:34,750 --> 02:01:38,818
so maybe it's impossible
to give up politics.

2373
02:01:38,820 --> 02:01:40,954
I have a great deal of respect
for the liberal democrats,

2374
02:01:40,956 --> 02:01:43,153
but I think that I won't
vote for them this time,

2375
02:01:43,178 --> 02:01:44,691
because I'll vote for Mr. McClain.

2376
02:01:44,693 --> 02:01:47,794
And in particular, he's keen
on to preserve our way of life

2377
02:01:47,796 --> 02:01:49,996
in the country with hunting,
in particular.

2378
02:01:49,998 --> 02:01:52,099
Well, it's going to
very disadvantage us

2379
02:01:52,101 --> 02:01:54,100
because we have changed
our farming policy

2380
02:01:54,102 --> 02:01:56,470
since foot and mouth
or any type of dairy cows.

2381
02:01:56,472 --> 02:01:59,639
Certainly more people vote. Perhaps they
see the impact on their lives more starkly

2382
02:01:59,641 --> 02:02:01,541
than people do in the city.

2383
02:02:01,543 --> 02:02:03,811
I found in London,
many parts of London,

2384
02:02:03,813 --> 02:02:05,980
there was a huge apathy
because it seemed -

2385
02:02:05,982 --> 02:02:07,981
Like they used to say,

2386
02:02:07,983 --> 02:02:10,217
"It doesn't matter who you vote for,
the government always gets in."

2387
02:02:10,219 --> 02:02:13,086
When I saw you seven years ago,

2388
02:02:13,088 --> 02:02:16,757
you seemed content, happy
in London, so why the change?

2389
02:02:16,759 --> 02:02:20,627
I neither felt that I was
satisfying the community around me,

2390
02:02:20,629 --> 02:02:23,163
nor did I feel
I was satisfying myself,

2391
02:02:23,165 --> 02:02:26,266
and that was obviously
not an ideal situation.

2392
02:02:26,268 --> 02:02:30,471
At 42, when Neil first arrived in
London from the Shetland Islands,

2393
02:02:30,473 --> 02:02:32,772
he lodged with Bruce.

2394
02:02:32,774 --> 02:02:34,141
He was a model host,

2395
02:02:34,143 --> 02:02:36,676
although he did always
insist on measuring

2396
02:02:36,678 --> 02:02:39,212
the amount of bathwater
that was in the bath,

2397
02:02:39,214 --> 02:02:41,248
and I am not quite sure
why that was.

2398
02:02:41,250 --> 02:02:43,750
He'd find the fridge a bit noisy,
so he would turn it off,

2399
02:02:43,752 --> 02:02:46,620
or if I had to hoover,
he'd walk round the block or...

2400
02:02:46,622 --> 02:02:50,390
No, I accept that I wasn't
the model lodger in every way,

2401
02:02:50,392 --> 02:02:54,895
and, however, that only emphasizes
how patient you actually were.

2402
02:02:54,897 --> 02:02:57,898
I've had little contact with Bruce.

2403
02:02:57,900 --> 02:02:59,767
We've exchanged one or two letters,

2404
02:02:59,769 --> 02:03:03,570
but maybe ours was a friendship
which flourished -

2405
02:03:03,572 --> 02:03:05,572
And it was a genuine friendship -

2406
02:03:05,574 --> 02:03:08,876
In the circumstances in which
we found ourselves in London.

2407
02:03:08,878 --> 02:03:10,877
I think that's what happens in life,

2408
02:03:10,879 --> 02:03:14,615
that people you're close to, and
then circumstances drift you apart,

2409
02:03:14,617 --> 02:03:17,551
and you find other people,

2410
02:03:17,553 --> 02:03:19,953
and you wonder now and again
what's happening to them

2411
02:03:19,955 --> 02:03:23,724
and hope they're all right,
but that's what happens in life.

2412
02:03:25,426 --> 02:03:28,495
In the winter, if you
lived in the country,

2413
02:03:28,497 --> 02:03:32,465
well, it was just all wet, and there
wouldn't be anything for miles around.

2414
02:03:34,535 --> 02:03:39,440
I feel, especially sometimes
when I'm on my own,

2415
02:03:39,442 --> 02:03:43,944
that I'm losing touch with
the way other people live.

2416
02:03:43,946 --> 02:03:47,047
(Michael) Do you worry
about your sanity?

2417
02:03:49,617 --> 02:03:53,754
Other people
sometimes worry about it.

2418
02:03:53,756 --> 02:03:55,355
Like who?

2419
02:03:59,394 --> 02:04:03,062
As I said,
I sometimes can be found

2420
02:04:03,064 --> 02:04:06,099
Behaving in an erratic fashion.

2421
02:04:06,101 --> 02:04:09,068
Sometimes I get very
frustrated, very angry

2422
02:04:09,070 --> 02:04:11,070
for no apparent reason,

2423
02:04:11,072 --> 02:04:14,707
for a reason which won't be apparent
to other people around me.

2424
02:04:14,709 --> 02:04:16,809
Do you ever think
you're going mad?

2425
02:04:16,811 --> 02:04:19,678
I don't think it.
I know it.

2426
02:04:19,680 --> 02:04:24,083
I, uh... Well, 'cause...

2427
02:04:24,085 --> 02:04:29,088
We're not allowed to use
the word "mad," but, um...

2428
02:04:29,090 --> 02:04:32,058
I think most people
are mad here, really.

2429
02:04:32,060 --> 02:04:33,726
How's your health?

2430
02:04:33,728 --> 02:04:35,762
It's probably very good
at the moment,

2431
02:04:35,764 --> 02:04:37,963
and living
in this rural setting

2432
02:04:37,965 --> 02:04:40,566
is obviously healthier than
living in the middle of a city.

2433
02:04:40,568 --> 02:04:42,101
There is less stress.

2434
02:04:45,572 --> 02:04:49,141
I ended up with
a former council flat,

2435
02:04:49,143 --> 02:04:52,445
which is nothing luxurious,
but I was lucky to get it,

2436
02:04:52,447 --> 02:04:57,016
and as soon as I could see
the view out of my window,

2437
02:04:57,018 --> 02:05:00,019
across the stream and trees
and the hills in the background,

2438
02:05:00,021 --> 02:05:02,254
I knew I was
in the right place.

2439
02:05:04,491 --> 02:05:06,158
I know that many people

2440
02:05:06,160 --> 02:05:09,895
say they feel closer to god
in the countryside.

2441
02:05:09,897 --> 02:05:13,565
I wouldn't want to be
simplistic about it,

2442
02:05:13,567 --> 02:05:17,369
but because one is much closer
to natural life,

2443
02:05:17,371 --> 02:05:20,973
one's therefore much closer
to the springs of life.

2444
02:05:20,975 --> 02:05:24,943
Yes, I'd say I believed in god.
Are you religious?

2445
02:05:24,945 --> 02:05:28,047
Well, I go to church
with me parents on Sundays.

2446
02:05:28,049 --> 02:05:31,184
I don't know even now whether
I do believe in god or not.

2447
02:05:31,186 --> 02:05:33,553
I've thought an awful lot
about it, actually,

2448
02:05:33,555 --> 02:05:35,521
and I still don't know.

2449
02:05:35,523 --> 02:05:37,990
How has he been treating you?

2450
02:05:37,992 --> 02:05:40,760
Well, I said to somebody
last week

2451
02:05:40,762 --> 02:05:43,662
that I preferred the old
testament to the new testament,

2452
02:05:43,664 --> 02:05:46,232
because in the old testament,

2453
02:05:46,234 --> 02:05:48,234
God is very unpredictable,

2454
02:05:48,236 --> 02:05:53,873
and that's, I think,
how I see him in my life.

2455
02:05:53,875 --> 02:05:57,009
¶ My Jesus

2456
02:05:57,011 --> 02:05:59,278
¶ My saviour

2457
02:05:59,280 --> 02:06:03,315
¶ Lord,
there is none like you

2458
02:06:03,317 --> 02:06:06,252
¶ Tower of refuge
and strength...

2459
02:06:06,254 --> 02:06:09,521
I bring Jim and Ann

2460
02:06:09,523 --> 02:06:12,191
and Bruce and Julia

2461
02:06:12,193 --> 02:06:13,459
and, uh...
Doreen.

2462
02:06:13,461 --> 02:06:15,828
...Doreen as well
and also...

2463
02:06:15,830 --> 02:06:19,598
I was first a lay reader
in London.

2464
02:06:19,600 --> 02:06:21,834
After completing
a little more training,

2465
02:06:21,836 --> 02:06:24,837
I was re-licensed
by the bishop of Carlisle.

2466
02:06:24,839 --> 02:06:27,306
Nature's lovely, nature's made
by god, but it's lovely...

2467
02:06:27,308 --> 02:06:31,277
Gives me the peace of mind
to accept when things

2468
02:06:31,279 --> 02:06:33,746
don't go the way they want to.

2469
02:06:33,748 --> 02:06:35,647
Politics can be
a very bruising game.

2470
02:06:35,649 --> 02:06:39,585
I will maintain my faith,
I will continue to trust in god.

2471
02:06:39,587 --> 02:06:43,455
I'm absolutely sure
that my faith

2472
02:06:43,457 --> 02:06:46,325
has helped me through
these difficult times.

2473
02:06:46,327 --> 02:06:49,862
Would you ever see having
a career in the church?

2474
02:06:49,864 --> 02:06:51,731
While I have a dedication
to the church,

2475
02:06:51,733 --> 02:06:54,901
I haven't experienced what I'd
call a calling into the priesthood

2476
02:06:54,903 --> 02:06:57,636
or anything of that kind,

2477
02:06:57,638 --> 02:07:00,606
so the answer is no
at the moment.

2478
02:07:00,608 --> 02:07:03,076
When I grow up,
I want to be an astronaut,

2479
02:07:03,078 --> 02:07:07,880
but if I can't be an astronaut,
I think I'll be a coach driver.

2480
02:07:07,882 --> 02:07:10,149
If the state didn't give us
any money,

2481
02:07:10,151 --> 02:07:12,618
it would probably just mean crime,

2482
02:07:12,620 --> 02:07:15,454
and I am glad I didn't have to
steal to keep myself alive.

2483
02:07:19,226 --> 02:07:21,526
Neil spends one day a week

2484
02:07:21,528 --> 02:07:23,762
doing voluntary work
for Oxfam.

2485
02:07:23,764 --> 02:07:26,499
Bernard, can you tell me why
people keep putting non...

2486
02:07:26,501 --> 02:07:28,768
I enjoy doing this.
It's relaxing.

2487
02:07:28,770 --> 02:07:32,138
I love books, and I enjoy
the company here as well.

2488
02:07:32,140 --> 02:07:36,708
I'd much rather have a full-time
job where I was being paid,

2489
02:07:36,710 --> 02:07:39,245
but because of
the council work I do,

2490
02:07:39,247 --> 02:07:43,149
I really want a job in the rest of
my time that isn't too stressful.

2491
02:07:43,151 --> 02:07:45,318
Well, these are all 6.99 new,

2492
02:07:45,320 --> 02:07:47,353
so I am putting them in at 1.99.

2493
02:07:47,355 --> 02:07:50,890
I get just over £200 a month
allowance for being a councillor.

2494
02:07:50,892 --> 02:07:55,194
On top of that, I get £9
a week jobseekers' allowance,

2495
02:07:55,196 --> 02:07:57,930
and because I am entitled
to the jobseekers' allowance,

2496
02:07:57,932 --> 02:08:02,235
I get my housing benefits
as well, which pays my rent.

2497
02:08:02,237 --> 02:08:05,504
I did some teaching of French to
young children last year for a while,

2498
02:08:05,506 --> 02:08:08,407
and that was very useful income
while I did it.

2499
02:08:08,409 --> 02:08:10,409
When I go home,

2500
02:08:10,411 --> 02:08:14,446
I come in, and mummy
gives me a cup of tea.

2501
02:08:14,448 --> 02:08:16,649
I don't think
I was really taught

2502
02:08:16,651 --> 02:08:19,284
any sort of policy of living
at all by my parents.

2503
02:08:19,286 --> 02:08:21,587
This is probably
the biggest mistake.

2504
02:08:21,589 --> 02:08:24,657
I was just left to fend
for myself in a world

2505
02:08:24,659 --> 02:08:26,658
which they seem
completely oblivious of.

2506
02:08:26,660 --> 02:08:28,727
What I'd like
most of all would be...

2507
02:08:28,729 --> 02:08:33,733
Would be to be able to do
something for my parents

2508
02:08:33,735 --> 02:08:35,701
when they're older,

2509
02:08:35,703 --> 02:08:38,237
to be there when...

2510
02:08:38,239 --> 02:08:42,241
when the time's necessary.

2511
02:08:42,243 --> 02:08:45,410
Well, my father died
five years ago.

2512
02:08:45,412 --> 02:08:48,614
I do feel, however,

2513
02:08:48,616 --> 02:08:51,016
that I'm a little nearer
to my mother since then,

2514
02:08:51,018 --> 02:08:54,686
but both geographically
and possibly emotionally,

2515
02:08:54,688 --> 02:08:56,588
it's never been
an easy relationship,

2516
02:08:56,590 --> 02:09:00,126
and I am not claiming
that everything is healed now,

2517
02:09:00,128 --> 02:09:03,995
but I feel I can speak
to my mother.

2518
02:09:03,997 --> 02:09:06,465
Do you miss your dad?

2519
02:09:06,467 --> 02:09:10,469
I - I had a great relationship
with my father

2520
02:09:10,471 --> 02:09:12,772
when I was much younger.

2521
02:09:12,774 --> 02:09:15,908
My relationship with him

2522
02:09:15,910 --> 02:09:19,244
did deteriorate as I got older.

2523
02:09:19,246 --> 02:09:22,381
I sometimes felt that he
made the wrong decision

2524
02:09:22,383 --> 02:09:25,651
in advice he'd given me
or things he'd done,

2525
02:09:25,653 --> 02:09:28,854
but then, obviously,
he had his own life to lead,

2526
02:09:28,856 --> 02:09:31,756
and just a few months
before he died,

2527
02:09:31,758 --> 02:09:34,460
we went together
to a cricket match.

2528
02:09:34,462 --> 02:09:37,896
Well, we had what I knew would probably
be the last long talk we would have

2529
02:09:37,898 --> 02:09:40,432
because he was dying
at the time then,

2530
02:09:40,434 --> 02:09:42,801
and I felt that
we were both relaxed

2531
02:09:42,803 --> 02:09:44,803
because we were doing
something we enjoyed doing,

2532
02:09:44,805 --> 02:09:48,507
which was relaxing in the
sunshine and watching sport,

2533
02:09:48,509 --> 02:09:51,844
so I felt that some way of -

2534
02:09:51,846 --> 02:09:54,880
some bridging of the gap
did take place that day.

2535
02:09:54,882 --> 02:09:57,849
When I get married, I don't
want to have any children,

2536
02:09:57,851 --> 02:10:02,254
because they are always
doing naughty things

2537
02:10:02,256 --> 02:10:05,557
and making the whole house untidy.

2538
02:10:05,559 --> 02:10:07,359
I always told myself

2539
02:10:07,361 --> 02:10:09,995
that I would never have children.

2540
02:10:11,598 --> 02:10:13,532
Why?

2541
02:10:13,534 --> 02:10:18,670
Because... Because,
well, because children

2542
02:10:18,672 --> 02:10:20,940
inherit something
from their parents,

2543
02:10:20,942 --> 02:10:23,608
and even if my wife

2544
02:10:23,610 --> 02:10:27,579
were the most high-spirited and
ordinary and normal of people,

2545
02:10:27,581 --> 02:10:30,416
the child would still
stand a very fair chance

2546
02:10:30,418 --> 02:10:34,886
of being not totally
full of happiness

2547
02:10:34,888 --> 02:10:39,525
because of what he or she
will have inherited from me.

2548
02:10:39,527 --> 02:10:43,562
No, I've never married, and I don't
have a girlfriend at the moment,

2549
02:10:43,564 --> 02:10:47,666
and I've - it's one of the
regrets of my life, actually,

2550
02:10:47,668 --> 02:10:51,136
that I've not met somebody
of the other sex

2551
02:10:51,138 --> 02:10:55,007
I thought I could have a more
permanent relationship with,

2552
02:10:55,009 --> 02:10:58,744
but - but I am probably not

2553
02:10:58,746 --> 02:11:01,513
the easiest of people
to get on with.

2554
02:11:03,149 --> 02:11:06,218
I did have one girlfriend
for close on two years,

2555
02:11:06,220 --> 02:11:09,054
so maybe I'm not as
completely hopeless a character

2556
02:11:09,056 --> 02:11:13,025
as might appear to be the case.

2557
02:11:13,027 --> 02:11:17,129
Do you miss a physical side,
a sexual side in your life?

2558
02:11:17,131 --> 02:11:19,498
Well, I am a physical person,

2559
02:11:19,500 --> 02:11:22,201
so I imagine I could be happy

2560
02:11:22,203 --> 02:11:26,038
in a lasting relationship
with somebody,

2561
02:11:26,040 --> 02:11:28,807
but you have to make do
with the reality,

2562
02:11:28,809 --> 02:11:31,410
and there are many things that
might have happened in my life

2563
02:11:31,412 --> 02:11:33,412
that haven't happened,

2564
02:11:33,414 --> 02:11:37,683
and there is little point
in being regretful

2565
02:11:37,685 --> 02:11:40,552
and angry about that.

2566
02:11:40,554 --> 02:11:44,957
You seem to have such much stronger
sense of purpose to your life

2567
02:11:44,959 --> 02:11:47,292
than you've had before.

2568
02:11:47,294 --> 02:11:50,028
I see that life comes once,

2569
02:11:50,030 --> 02:11:52,097
and it's quite short,

2570
02:11:52,099 --> 02:11:54,366
and you have to appreciate
what's good in it,

2571
02:11:54,368 --> 02:11:57,603
and if I could just
tell a short story.

2572
02:11:57,605 --> 02:12:01,907
I was just sunbathing and I - a
butterfly landed quite close to me -

2573
02:12:01,909 --> 02:12:04,376
Beautiful wings, deep red colours

2574
02:12:04,378 --> 02:12:06,411
and white sort of circles on them -

2575
02:12:06,413 --> 02:12:10,182
And these creatures
don't last very long,

2576
02:12:10,184 --> 02:12:12,751
but it landed very close to me.

2577
02:12:12,753 --> 02:12:14,887
It didn't seem frightened.

2578
02:12:14,889 --> 02:12:18,290
And it just seemed to delight
in opening and closing its wings

2579
02:12:18,292 --> 02:12:21,359
and just actually being beautiful
for that period of time,

2580
02:12:21,361 --> 02:12:23,228
enjoying the sunshine,

2581
02:12:23,230 --> 02:12:26,331
and perhaps there isn't actually
any more to life than that,

2582
02:12:26,333 --> 02:12:28,467
than just being what you are,

2583
02:12:28,469 --> 02:12:31,804
realizing that there -
that life goes on all around,

2584
02:12:31,806 --> 02:12:33,838
and there are millions
of other living creatures

2585
02:12:33,840 --> 02:12:35,775
who all have to find
their paths as well.

2586
02:12:42,215 --> 02:12:45,884
Whee!

2587
02:12:45,886 --> 02:12:49,388
(narrator) At the end of their
very special day in London,

2588
02:12:49,390 --> 02:12:52,724
after their trip
to the zoo and the party,

2589
02:12:52,726 --> 02:12:55,227
we took our children
to an adventure playground

2590
02:12:55,229 --> 02:12:59,298
where they could do
just what they liked.

2591
02:12:59,300 --> 02:13:03,635
Those from the children's home
set about building a house.

2592
02:13:14,848 --> 02:13:17,315
There's Nicholas.

2593
02:13:22,488 --> 02:13:23,856
And Tony.

2594
02:13:29,496 --> 02:13:31,429
Andrew.

2595
02:13:34,801 --> 02:13:36,669
John.

2596
02:13:40,841 --> 02:13:42,208
And Bruce.

2597
02:13:48,748 --> 02:13:50,215
Suzie.

2598
02:13:55,788 --> 02:13:57,722
Jackie and her friends.

2599
02:14:03,897 --> 02:14:06,799
Give me a child
until he is seven,

2600
02:14:06,801 --> 02:14:09,201
and I will give you the man.

2601
02:14:17,176 --> 02:14:21,280
This has been a glimpse
of Britain's future.
