<i>There are eight pain and sufferings
that humans go through.</i>

3
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,840
<i>Birth, aging, sickness, and death.</i>

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,560
<i>With these four...</i>

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,700
<i>Facing things you hate.</i>

6
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:31,750
<i>The pain of facing things you hate.</i>

7
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,030
<i>Saying goodbye to your loved ones.</i>

8
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:38,760
<i>The pain of saying goodbye
to your loved ones.</i>

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:46,300
<i>The pain of not getting what you want.</i>

00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:54,100
- Hello?
- Eun Ha Soo? I'll make it quick.

11
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,710
Come to the hospital, hurry.

12
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,570
The hospital?

13
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,330
- What happened? Did he go into surgery?
- Yes.

14
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,490
He can't go into surgery.

15
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,890
We should stop the surgery now!

16
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,030
- I'll start the anesthesia.
- Sure.

17
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,640
What is she taking so long?

18
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,990
We should stop the surgery.

19
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,050
- This is serious.
- What happened?

20
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:39,730
What took you so long?
I was going crazy.

21
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:42,950
- Come this way.
- What are you doing?

22
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,610
- Can't you see that he's in surgery?
- He needs her now.

23
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,730
If he has her nearby,
the pain will go away.

24
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,730
He can live again.

25
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:52,450
- Come to your senses, Manager Sung!
- Oh my goodness.

26
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,310
What condition is he in?

27
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,530
He's not in a critical condition, is he?

28
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,090
- We have to save him!
- Why are you doing this?

29
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,090
I will explain later.

30
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,670
Just let go of me for now.
Eun Ha Soo, let's go.

31
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,480
I said let go of me.

32
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,920
I said let go!

33
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,850
We will start now. Scalpel.

34
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:16,340
- What is it?
- He's going into cardiac arrest.

35
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,850
- Get it ready?

36
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:22,520
Five, six, seven, eight, nine...

37
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,680
- It's ready.
- Clear! Shock!

38
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,290
Charge.

39
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,140
One, two, three, four...

40
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,220
<i>[Episode 10]</i>

41
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,870
- How is he?
- He's making a quick recovery...

42
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,610
but he still needs to rest for now.

43
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,350
Why does that sign say, 'No Visitors?

44
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:39,420
The patient doesn't wish
to see anybody right now.

45
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,230
He can move around

46
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,860
so he asked his guardians
not to come in, either.

47
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,420
What is he doing?
I have to know how he is.

48
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,480
He should let us see him at least.

49
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,560
But it's a good thing that he regained
consciousness before the surgery.

50
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,690
What did you mean that his pain would stop
if Eun Ha Soo was by his side?

51
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:18,220
Well...

52
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:22,740
It's just hard to explain...

53
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,740
Why were you against the surgery?

54
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,500
Well, when he wakes up,
you can ask him yourself.

55
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,780
I'm not in a position to say anything.

56
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,790
I'm going to go ask the doctor
something and come right back.

57
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,730
Go home.

58
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,730
What about you?

59
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,910
I plan on taking her home
and coming back here.

60
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,720
I can take a taxi.

61
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,890
Get in. I have something
to tell you, too.

62
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,710
Do that. It's late,
so let him take you home.

63
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,060
So you're saying that
you've seen him like that, huh?

64
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,850
Yes.

65
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:49,800
I told him to go and see a doctor.

66
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,480
I thought you knew about it, too.

67
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,410
I didn't really care, so...

68
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,120
You two appear that way...

69
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,290
But I could feel that you worry
and care for each other.

70
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:09,220
I'm sure you two will get along fine.

71
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,820
He's so much like
my late father, you know.

72
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,820
So that might be difficult.

73
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,720
After my father passed away

74
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,070
I wished for a brother who
at least looked like him.

75
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:25,850
That's the difference between
whether you liked your father or not.

76
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:32,550
Don't you miss him, to be honest?

77
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,660
We're all like that, you know.

78
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,730
Whether you like the person or not

79
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,920
if the person leaves suddenly

80
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,650
you keep thinking about
the things you didn't get to say.

81
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:54,790
You're sorry for the feelings you didn't
get to work out with one another.

82
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:05,020
That's how I feel as well.

83
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:09,600
In any case, I'm grateful.

84
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,550
That there is someone
who worries about my brother.

85
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:22,060
And... he will get better.

86
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,530
Don't worry.

87
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:29,220
If he suddenly gets sick again
or something happens

88
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,020
- please call me.
- Sure, I will.

89
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,970
What? He disappeared from
his hospital room?

90
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,400
Where could he possibly go
in that condition?

91
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,460
Dae Han says he's about to go crazy.

92
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:23,390
He came over to see me.

93
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:26,190
He said he wanted see a psychiatrist.

94
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,130
The more time he spends
with Choi Shin Hyung

95
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,560
the more he feels that
he's like his late father.

96
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,720
Gosh, I even feel that way.

97
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,850
- Can you imagine how Dae Han must feel?
- But still...

98
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,820
No matter how much technology
has improved, he can't get that young.

99
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:43,170
God forbid, if he's really our brother,
what should we do?

100
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,560
We literally kicked him out in the rain.

101
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,270
We were teasing him like this, too.

102
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,410
What nonsense is that?

103
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,450
How can he possibly be
the late Chairman Choi?

104
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:54,430
Are we shooting a sci-fi movie or what?

105
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:57,590
I can't stand your pronunciation.

106
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:01,590
Either way, why did he disappear on us?

107
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:05,510
Does he have some kind of disease
we don't know about?

108
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,550
Like he's been diagnosed terminally ill?

109
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,720
- If so, why would he disappear?
- True.

110
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,320
Then maybe he has some kind
of contagious disease...

111
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,300
Like a rash that appears everywhere.

112
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,660
Did you forget that
he doesn't care about us?

113
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,140
- Wake up, sister-in-law!
- That's true.

114
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,970
It's better if he disappears
for good like this

115
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:27,680
but I have a feeling that
he'll show up again, huh?

116
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,660
What if he shows up with
a secret weapon next time?

117
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:36,580
He'll learn martial arts and use swords
against us like a kung fu master.

118
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:40,060
As  if he wants to kill us
like this and this...

119
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,900
Honey, it's me.

120
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:45,800
Gosh, aren't you having fun.

121
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,830
Where did he go?

122
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,740
He disappeared on me
while I was dozing off.

123
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,490
Manager Sung, how do you know
Choi Shin Hyung?

124
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,530
What are you talking about
all of a sudden?

125
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:04,890
You two seem very close.

126
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:08,100
It doesn't seem like you two
met a few months ago.

127
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,780
It's just that he's the
late Chairman Choi's son.

128
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:14,830
Plus, he asked that I take care of him
before he passed away.

129
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,420
That's why I was doing my best.

130
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:20,900
- Why? Does that bother you?
- That's not it.

131
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:26,110
To me, it looked as though
you were assisting my late father.

132
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:31,380
That can't possibly be true.
Your father passed away!

133
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:35,390
Seeing how you behaved yesterday
at the hospital left me wondering even more.

134
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,200
When you asked to stop the surgery

135
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,200
and when he was in the recovery room.

136
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,740
The way you worry that something
will happen to  Choi Shin Hyung...

137
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,200
wasn't just because of
my late father's request...

138
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,120
but you seemed very sincere.

139
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,890
Gosh, was I?

140
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:54,500
It's because I'm emotional.
I'll control my emotions next time.

141
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,910
You must have been really worried.

142
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,250
Is that really all there is?

143
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,680
Of course!
Why would I hide anything from you?

144
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,210
I like you, man.

145
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:09,090
I don't know if I was hallucinating
about my late father...

146
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:11,970
My heart tells me that
he's definitely my father

147
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:14,510
but my brain doesn't agree.

148
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:19,300
His blood is definitely identical
to my late father's...

149
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,560
But he can't be my father.

150
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,600
He says he isn't my father either,
so it's driving me crazy.

151
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,370
- If you feel he's your father, then he is.
- Pardon?

152
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:37,020
It's because they're so alike, you know.

153
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:43,060
Anyway, please find out
where Choi Shin Hyung might be.

154
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,200
If you find him,
please let me know right away.

155
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,710
Of course, I will.

156
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:51,170
- Is that why you called me here?
- Yes.

157
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,850
You could have called me
on the phone instead!

158
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:56,680
I should be running around
looking for him.

159
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,500
Gosh, that was for nothing.

160
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:14,700
<i>Because he never trusted me.</i>

161
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,740
<i>Not even once.</i>

162
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:53,000
Father.

163
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,760
Father, father!

164
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,010
I think you're my father. Father.

165
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:04,340
Father, father!

166
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:08,440
<i>Father, father!</i>

167
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,220
Daddy, can I eat sweet and sour pork today?

168
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,310
Here, eat this.

169
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:43,710
Not jjajangmyun,
but sweet and sour pork.

170
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:47,060
Why would you order sweet and sour pork
when you can't even finish this?

171
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,060
Eat up.

172
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:53,220
- I won't eat then!
- How rude.

173
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:59,140
We had a play about an old man
with a lump at kindergarten yesterday.

174
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,100
You didn't come.

175
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:07,590
All the other kids' parents
came to take pictures.

176
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:11,390
- They brought flowers, too.
- It was enough that your mom was there.

177
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:14,020
Daddy was busy working yesterday.

178
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,250
Go on.

179
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,770
No, I won't eat it.

180
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:22,080
Eat up!

181
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:26,930
Aren't you going to eat?

182
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,000
I said eat!

183
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:59,060
<i>What's the big deal with this
measly sweet and sour pork, huh?</i>

184
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,850
<i>I couldn't even buy him this.</i>

185
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:06,920
<i>Why did I do that to you?</i>

186
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,250
<i>Why was I living like that then?</i>

187
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:13,400
<i>What kind of fortunate life
was I trying to live?</i>

188
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:20,240
<i>I thought it was right to live
like that at that time.</i>

189
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,640
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

190
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:29,880
<i>I'm sorry, my son.</i>

191
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,840
<i>[My dreams.]</i>

192
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:51,630
<i>[Be happy every day.]</i>

193
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,710
<i>[Make memories sometimes.]</i>

194
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,450
<i>[Learn to ride a bicycle again.]</i>

195
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,830
<i>[Try a parachute like my son.]</i>

196
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:08,800
<i>[Go on a trip with my son.]</i>

197
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:13,450
<i>[Make seaweed soup
on my son's birthday.]</i>

198
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:37,830
<i>[Choi Dae Han]
[Eun Ha Soo]</i>

199
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:55,010
<i>Are you okay?</i>

200
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:06,470
<i>I'm not doing well.</i>

201
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:09,450
<i>I'm too worried to sleep tonight.</i>

202
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:18,660
<i>[Choi Shin Hyung]</i>

203
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:28,850
<i>Redirecting your call...</i>

204
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:34,300
- What's up?
- About Choi Shin Hyung...

205
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:38,090
I can't get in touch with him,
so I was wondering if everything was okay.

206
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,100
- He disappeared.
- Pardon?

207
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,660
I don't think he's in contact
with anybody right now.

208
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:49,400
I don't know if he has
a serious illness or...

209
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,000
Then...

210
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,110
You said he was someone who's
eventually going to leave.

211
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:58,380
What did you mean by that?

212
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,380
It was just a hunch.

213
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,580
I said that because I wouldn't
be able to stand him much long.

214
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:09,300
But I'm kind of worried now.

215
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:13,820
I have a feeling that
I had something to do with it.

216
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,410
I told him that I really liked you.

217
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:21,350
Maybe he didn't want
things to come between brothers.

218
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:24,430
That might be why he left.

219
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,990
It's really hard to have dinner
with you, huh?

220
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:36,020
You asked me to buy you dinner
all the time when we were in school.

221
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,030
Why are you bringing up
the past again?

222
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:40,270
I should have asked you out then.

223
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,730
I might have taken too long.

224
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:46,030
Stop it and eat.

225
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,690
I heard Choi Shin Hyung disappeared.

226
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,780
After a dispute with President Choi

227
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,160
he decided to go elsewhere for good?

228
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,060
I don't think that's what it is.

229
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,800
He seems to have a health issue.

230
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,460
He may want to be left alone.

231
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:11,810
More importantly, what was that
about President Choi?

232
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,440
He seems to be working
to revive Seohae Hotel.

233
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,600
Was that your idea?

234
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,030
Well, I thought if that went well...

235
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:24,150
then his place at the company
will be secure.

236
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:27,350
How long will you live as his shadow?

237
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,200
If something goes wrong,
you'll get hurt, too.

238
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,160
Walk away now.

239
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,160
I'll do a good job,
so we won't get hurt.

240
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,960
Do you really have feelings
for Choi Dae Han?

241
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,890
Are you serious?

242
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:43,690
He doesn't even see me that way.

243
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:49,210
Does it matter whether
I'm serious or not?

244
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:20,640
<i>Are you okay? I'm not doing well.</i>

245
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,340
<i>I'm too worried to sleep tonight.</i>

246
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:26,270
<i>Why did you turn your phone off?</i>

247
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:28,470
<i>Where in the world did you go?</i>

248
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:32,420
<i>Are you really not
going to answer my calls?</i>

249
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,810
<i>I won't ever call you again.</i>

250
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:10,010
- You still can't get a hold of him?
- No.

251
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:12,720
Gosh, what happened?

252
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,360
What if he left for
someplace far away?

253
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:20,100
What if he gets sick again?

254
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,900
<i>In the morning of 48th day
of being young</i>

255
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,460
<i>he couldn't wake up for good.</i>

256
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:51,020
<i>How should I spend
this precious time I was given</i>

257
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:54,770
<i>so I may die without regrets?</i>

258
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:05,190
Choi Go Bong!

259
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:09,770
Let's go back and
try aging the proper way!

260
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:23,430
- Where have you been?
- Well, here and there.

261
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,480
How could you just disappear like that?

262
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:30,190
We live together.
You should at least answer the phone.

263
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:33,570
Now that my phone
is turned on, call me.

264
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:37,120
How sick are you?
When did it start?

265
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:40,180
The doctor said you didn't have
any serious diseases.

266
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:43,630
- It was nothing.
- Why didn't you want the surgery?

267
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:47,090
Don't you know that
it could damage your heart?

268
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:50,450
You don't need to worry about that.

269
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:52,730
Then...

270
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:56,840
did you stay away because of me?

271
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,600
Eun Ha Soo is worried about you.

272
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:06,230
Call her now.

273
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:10,210
- Why should I?
- She's waiting for your call!

274
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,430
Don't just walk away
after you made her fall for you.

275
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:18,350
You know how irresponsible that is.

276
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:28,160
And if you go somewhere,
let me know from now on.

277
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,780
<i>[Choi Go Bong has 22 days
to return on his payment.]</i>

278
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,170
Did you have dinner?

279
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:32,140
This was in my room.
Why do you have this?

280
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,850
Give it to me.

281
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:38,690
- I said give it.
- No.

282
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:40,370
What are you going to do with it?

283
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:44,030
It's a keepsake from my father.
I want to keep it.

284
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:50,970
Go. I'm going to go to bed now.

285
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,820
When my father was around,
we were always number one.

286
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:28,500
- We have a problem now.
- That's why Seohae Hotel has to work.

287
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,510
And about Choi Shin Hyung...

288
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:42,590
it might damage your reputation
to have him work as a janitor.

289
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:45,350
I also started from that position
when my father was around.

290
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:49,160
Back then, his reputation
improved because of it.

291
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,010
Saying that he was
teaching his son properly.

292
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,240
It worked because
he was your father...

293
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,380
you two are half-brothers.

294
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,000
- Anybody will assume...
- So what are you proposing?

295
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,150
I really don't know how you feel
about Choi Shin Hyung.

296
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:10,100
Do you... acknowledge him
as your older brother now?

297
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:15,650
He was willing to take the fall
and go to prison for me.

298
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,950
It seems President Choi is
really starting to work now, huh?

299
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:25,930
They're asking for employees to apply?

300
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:29,310
Ha Soo, should we apply for this?

301
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:33,160
Well, we will have to
go out there to work.

302
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,200
Why not? It's near the ocean,
so it should be nice.

303
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,030
Plus, if President Choi works hard

304
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:42,460
it will save us interns, too.

305
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,220
He read them.

306
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:57,320
Why hasn't he responded
if he's read them yet?

307
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:03,600
Can we talk?

308
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,810
Since the work is off-site,
there are only few applicants.

309
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:16,130
I hope you can help out.

310
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:19,470
You've changed your mind, huh?

311
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:22,370
Why are you offering this to me?

312
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:27,440
To me, you're just like
the late Chairman Choi.

313
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:33,310
I'm sure that you've inherited
his business skills as well.

314
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:37,160
What grounds do you
have to say such things?

315
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,800
If you make it work

316
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,270
we will give you an appropriate title.

317
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:23,770
I told you to stay home.
Why did you come?

318
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:26,500
What am I, an old man?

319
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:31,840
People might think that
I have a serious illness.

320
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,160
'If it's something you really want to do'

321
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,870
'you will see a way.'

322
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:41,070
'If it's something you dread'

323
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,340
'you will see an excuse.'

324
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:49,610
As for Seohae Hotel...

325
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:52,410
I told you not to mention
that name, didn't I?

326
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,020
It's where my mother died.

327
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:01,570
My mother and I stayed there
while my father was too busy working.

328
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:04,120
It isn't some place for you
to speak so freely about.

329
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,360
That's why you should protect it!

330
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,530
If the hotel can't improve
its facilities immediately

331
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:11,060
you have to at least
make guests like it.

332
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,370
What can you possibly do
by sitting behind a desk?

333
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:16,180
During this critical moment,
you should be out there.

334
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,950
Go out there!

335
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:23,720
Go and find who we should
target to bring in!

336
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,080
Father.

337
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,490
Seriously.

338
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:30,750
There you go again.

339
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:43,100
My sister-in-law is quick, huh?

340
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:46,180
Seriously, Young Dal, too.

341
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,020
Since we're talking about it

342
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,900
In order to push away the idea
of reviving Seohae Hotel

343
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,040
their idea isn't good enough.

344
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:56,470
If we make a deal with luxury brand names
that haven't been imported yet

345
00:30:56,470 --> 00:31:00,100
I think we can get
some attention that way.

346
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,930
That's also what I'm good at.

347
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:06,350
There's a fashion show of
premium designers in Italy next week.

348
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:08,550
I received an invitation.

349
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:11,150
I wasn't going to go...

350
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:13,220
but maybe I should then.

351
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,900
Go then.

352
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:18,320
Everything is about
who you know in this field.

353
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,210
Pay special attention to lobbying.

354
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:23,130
If I'm going to go,
we should go together.

355
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:26,440
Where can I possibly go
when the company is in a crisis?

356
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:31,940
It's not because of Hong Ji Yoon, is it?

357
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,540
A woman like her isn't fun.

358
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:41,730
We only live once, so we should
enjoy it as much as we can, huh?

359
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:45,830
Let's see what happens.
If this matter gets resolved well...

360
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:50,890
What are you going to do
about Choi Shin Hyung?

361
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:53,990
He's the one who gave us
the fake documents on Cruise Hotel.

362
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:56,940
Are you going to just leave him alone?

363
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:05,970
- There are this many?
- It won't be easy.

364
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:08,100
I will go over it with you.

365
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:15,310
Your management power depends on
how this Seohae Hotel turns out.

366
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,470
You showed confidence
to the board of directors...

367
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:20,080
so you must make it work.

368
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,110
I got it, so start.

369
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,230
What is this?

370
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:01,440
Is there something wrong, Aunt?

371
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,800
It's a sample of Meditel in America.

372
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:07,100
Oh my.

373
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,900
It can't be.

374
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:13,610
My late father definitely told me
that this was for Cruise Hotel...

375
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:17,880
If you continue to scam people
using my brother's name like that

376
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,100
I can send you to prison for real.

377
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,690
Oh my.

378
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:24,640
It hasn't been that long
since I was discharged.

379
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,080
You brought my brother down with
the secret accounting ledger I gave you.

380
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,160
You're trying to take over Daehan
any way you can?

381
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,000
Bring the original immediately.

382
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,870
- The deal has to be fair.
- If I give you the original...

383
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:39,850
You'll hand it over
to Jung Yi Gun...

384
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:44,160
and do you really think you two
will live happily ever after?

385
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,880
- What?
- Come to your senses!

386
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,640
It wasn't enough that you were scammed
to get married and got divorced?

387
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,090
How foolish are you to be used by men!

388
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:55,850
Is that what your brother taught you?

389
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:59,770
He didn't even eat much to support
his siblings until he passed away.

390
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:03,280
How can you possibly do this to him?

391
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,970
Who are you?

392
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:11,250
'Please stop breaking my heart!'

393
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:15,060
I mean my father in Heaven
would say that!

394
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:18,330
What do you possibly know?

395
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:22,480
What do you possibly know
about my turbulent life?

396
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,580
<i>Go down further.</i>

397
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,940
<i>To the left.</i>

398
00:34:57,270 --> 00:35:00,430
- Seriously.
- Gosh, you lost it.

399
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:03,080
- Can I have more coins?
- I'm all out.

400
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:06,000
- Stop it.
- I wanted to get that stuffed dog.

401
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,960
This thing is built
so that you don't win.

402
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:11,060
Catch. Shin Hyung gave this to me.

403
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:13,340
Hello there.

404
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:26,630
<i>Migratory birds follow the wind
to get to their hometown.</i>

405
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:33,290
The ocean follows the waves
to get to the horizon.

406
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:41,350
I'm thinking of following
the blue sky...

407
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:49,120
and get to The Milky Way, Eun Ha Soo.

408
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:55,280
<i>Can I do that?</i>

409
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:08,930
<i>[I'm okay. Sorry that I worried you.]</i>

410
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:15,470
He didn't misspell one word.

411
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,550
The Milky Way, Eun Ha Soo.

412
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:42,670
Now I'm hearing things, huh?

413
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:48,810
Why does a grown woman
walk around alone at this late hour?

414
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,560
Where are we going?

415
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:49,610
I wanted to give you
a present to apologize.

416
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:52,920
You literally disappeared
and worried me to death.

417
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,960
How can you show up like this?

418
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:00,300
I'm not that easy.
A present won't make me forgive you.

419
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,850
It's pretty.

420
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:17,150
What do you think? Do you like it?

421
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:20,180
It's so pretty.

422
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,470
We can even see the constellations.

423
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:27,390
- Do you know the constellations?
- A little bit.

424
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:36,910
Way up there, it looks like the Orion.

425
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:40,890
Where? Huh?

426
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:45,290
- Where?
- Well...

427
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,860
Over there.

428
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:55,810
Is it the one that looks like
a crushed scoop?

429
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:57,940
Yes.

430
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:03,370
The legend about the
Orion constellation is of

431
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:07,030
an unfulfilled love between
a human and a god.

432
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:09,830
The Goddess Artemis
who fell in love with Orion...

433
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:14,740
was tricked by her brother and
ended up shooting an arrow to kill Orion.

434
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:18,720
Gosh, it's a tragedy.

435
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:25,450
What kind of ending will we have?

436
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:31,100
We've just started out, but you're
already thinking of how this will end?

437
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:35,170
It's because it's better not to start
if we expect a bad ending.

438
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:39,920
There's no way of knowing how it's going
to end unless you start something.

439
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,520
Well, that's not entirely true.

440
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:48,190
Why are you already
thinking about how it ends?

441
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:53,690
It could go on forever
and be beautiful...

442
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:56,790
like those stars.

443
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:03,900
Like The Milky Way, Eun Ha Soo?

444
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:21,770
I'll have a lot of work
to do from now on.

445
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:25,830
I'm saying this because
I'll be very busy.

446
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:31,810
If there's anything special
you'd like to do with me

447
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:34,150
write down five things.

448
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:37,130
Only five things?

449
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:39,100
That's all we can do together?

450
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:43,270
Well, at least for now...

451
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:48,120
It's your homework.

452
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:50,500
Will you write them down?

453
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:54,080
Fine.

454
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:01,350
What is your zodiac sign?

455
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:04,100
My zodiac sign?

456
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:08,720
- Not sure.
- When is your birthday?

457
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,080
November 5.

458
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:14,010
Let's see. If it's November 5...

459
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:16,430
your sign is Libra.

460
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:18,540
My sign is Libra?

461
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:22,690
Mine is Sagittarius, because
my birthday is in December.

462
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:24,500
Is it?

463
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,610
Your birthday is coming up soon then.

464
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:48,440
After you disappeared all of a sudden

465
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,330
where were you hiding?

466
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:53,910
How is Dae Han doing with Seohae Hotel?

467
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:56,470
You're worrying about your son
at a time like this?

468
00:41:56,470 --> 00:42:00,140
They say blood is thicker than water,
and I can see why.

469
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:02,530
- What?
- It's about Dae Han.

470
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:08,200
Do you know how worried he was
after you disappeared?

471
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,900
I guess he gets bored
when I'm not around.

472
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:14,110
Stop worrying about your son...

473
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:16,850
and start to enjoy yourself.

474
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:20,770
Do the things you haven't done
and try all the foods you haven't tried.

475
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:21,830
What?

476
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:24,350
Every moment is precious.

477
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:27,530
What if the 48th day is really
the last day of your life?

478
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:29,530
How upsetting is that?

479
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:34,320
So do everything you couldn't
do before because of work.

480
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:37,310
It's not like you're short on money.

481
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:42,270
By the way, how much
do you like Eun Ha Soo?

482
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:44,260
You're not in love with her, are you?

483
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,350
You punk, seriously.

484
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:49,180
- There's nothing you won't say now, huh?
- We'll get into a car accident.

485
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:52,930
Drive properly, okay?

486
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,130
Hey there, are you going somewhere?

487
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:00,420
I'm going to apply for
a position at Seohae Hotel.

488
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:03,560
Why? Why would you?

489
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,360
I hear no one wants to do it.

490
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:09,710
It's about promotion the hotel,
so I'll probably learn a lot.

491
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:12,290
It would be better if I could contribute.

492
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:15,970
Thank you.

493
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:20,430
Both of you are thanking me.

494
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:24,200
When you disappeared from the hospital

495
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:27,010
President Choi thanked me
for worrying about you.

496
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:29,430
He did?

497
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:33,220
- Did he do that, huh?
- Yes.

498
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:37,250
- Go about your work .
- I'll get going.

499
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:52,810
<i>Every moment is precious.</i>

500
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:55,910
<i>What if the 48th day is really
the last day of your life?</i>

501
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:57,530
<i>How upsetting is that?</i>

502
00:43:57,530 --> 00:44:00,990
<i>So do all the things you couldn't do
when you were young.</i>

503
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:27,680
So I was wondering if any of you
would want to go and work there.

504
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:32,230
It won't be higher pay and you may
have to work longer hours

505
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:37,640
But it could be a good opportunity
for someone who wants to learn.

506
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:44,650
First take a look at the plan
Manager Hong gave us and think about it.

507
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:47,160
It could be hard...

508
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:50,580
but if we cooperate,
we can at least try.

509
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:52,270
Well said.

510
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:07,000
Please follow me.

511
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:16,720
Welcome to Seohae Hotel.

512
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:26,560
- Why are you here?
- President Choi.

513
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,690
I came to see how well
you'll pull this off.

514
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:32,170
How dare you come here?

515
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,510
Let go.

516
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:37,990
Do you have any idea
how special this place is to me?

517
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:40,600
I asked him to come.

518
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,790
Why?

519
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:44,500
I'll tell you later.

520
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:47,660
- I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier.
- Sorry for what?

521
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:49,470
You did the right thing, Manager Hong.

522
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:53,150
Good thing that you scouted
such a talent like me.

523
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:59,100
Let's go, okay?

524
00:46:00,610 --> 00:46:03,350
He drives me crazy.

525
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:07,990
- Wow, it's nice.
- It's clean.

526
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:16,850
It's nice.

527
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:21,040
Even if it's dispatched work,
it's still nice to come this far.

528
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,790
I feel like I'm on a trip.
I'm all excited.

529
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:31,540
As if a sudden trip
leading to a love affair?

530
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,920
Listen to yourself.

531
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:39,110
You're definitely in love, aren't you?
Saying things you don't normally say.

532
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:43,030
You're so happy to see
Choi Shin Hyung here, aren't you?

533
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:46,010
I was shocked.

534
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:49,790
Why did you call him here?

535
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:52,750
You know very well
what this place means to me.

536
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:57,200
Choi Shin Hyung possesses
the late Chairman Choi's techniques.

537
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,980
Rather than letting your personal
feelings get in the way

538
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:04,860
you must focus on reviving
Seohae Hotel right now.

539
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:08,530
How do you not let your personal
feelings get in the way?

540
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:10,530
I'm more amazed by that.

541
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:15,820
It could be a sign that
you're full of emotions and innocent.

542
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:31,720
- What's so funny?
- No, he's just very funny.

543
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,780
What? Can't I be funny?

544
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:36,670
We do this to make a living.

545
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:38,530
We live to laugh.

546
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:40,720
Don't you think so?

547
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:46,410
- Is it or isn't it?
- What are you doing?

548
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:48,240
Is it or isn't it?

549
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:50,500
You're driving me nuts.

550
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:54,500
Stop it, seriously.

551
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,730
Seriously?

552
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:28,640
What are they doing?
Fighting or what?

553
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,240
Please stop!

554
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:41,240
Gosh, I'm tired.

555
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:44,560
How could you two play like little kids?

556
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:48,500
Men usually get into it
once they get started.

557
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,030
- Oh my.
- Gosh, that man...

558
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:54,100
I wonder who he takes after
to get so worked up like that.

559
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:56,760
To me, you two are so alike.

560
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:02,940
But it has been a while since
we played around together.

561
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:07,010
- Pardon?
- No, nothing.

562
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:13,560
Anyway, did you think about
your homework?

563
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:16,330
I thought about it,
but I just had too many.

564
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:19,420
I'll do whatever you ask for,
so choose wisely.

565
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:21,530
Why are you asking me that, though?

566
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:24,130
Are you going to leave after
we complete the homework or something?

567
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:28,350
Nonsense.

568
00:49:28,350 --> 00:49:31,660
If not, why are you asking me
those questions?

569
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:39,100
That's because I feel like
doing that for you.

570
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:43,580
So stop the nonsense, and just tell me.

571
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:46,730
It's something very hard to do...

572
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,660
Come on, tell me.

573
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:57,120
After we go back, I'll text you
one by one every morning.

574
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:00,560
How am I supposed to wait that long?
Just tell me now.

575
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:04,250
No, I'm going to text you.

576
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:07,240
Gosh.

577
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:34,100
- It's not bad.
- Isn't it?

578
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:37,910
Let's demolish the lousy
Seohae Hotel immediately...

579
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:39,580
and start construction.

580
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:45,100
The premium brands are already
trying to get their store sites.

581
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:49,020
As President Choi and Choi Shin Hyung
are working on Seohae Hotel now

582
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:50,810
it may not be easy.

583
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:55,130
Why don't we send them
together overseas?

584
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:58,460
We can push forward with it
while they are away.

585
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:01,190
We're doing this for the sake
of the company, you know.

586
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:02,880
How can we do that?

587
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,790
It's always women that move men.

588
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:10,690
It will be an easy task
if we use this woman.

589
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:12,630
A woman?

590
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:17,650
Now we write our wishes in this lantern.

591
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:20,180
We ask the guests
to write their wishes down...

592
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:22,920
and we put it inside this case.

593
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,770
We will demonstrate how it's done.

594
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:28,290
Why don't we all write on
a piece of paper?

595
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:39,850
- What are you writing?
- You can't look.

596
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:52,520
- What are you writing?
- Don't look.

597
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,840
Now write your name on the case too.

598
00:51:58,830 --> 00:52:04,060
Put the piece of paper
inside the lantern now.

599
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:09,750
Let's wish that your wishes
will come true.

600
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:33,400
I want to thank those who volunteered
to come out here today.

601
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:44,540
To me, I feel today will be
a precious day I won't ever forget.

602
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:51,670
I'm embarrassed to say that
for the first time...

603
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:55,770
I feel that I depend on you.

604
00:52:55,770 --> 00:52:58,510
Thank you very much.

605
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:13,260
And... Eun Ha Soo.

606
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:21,830
Thank you.

607
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,200
What are you doing here?

608
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:55,750
I was just getting some air.

609
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:57,360
Now that you're here,
how do you like it here?

610
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:00,840
Now I look at it again, it's too good
to give it to someone else.

611
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:03,200
Isn't this your first time here?

612
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,740
Ah, that's right.

613
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:11,730
Our late father did a good job
building this.

614
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Go inside.

615
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,780
You could catch a cold.

616
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:22,080
I like that he worries about me...

617
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:25,000
but it oddly makes me feel bad.

618
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:32,650
Was it a yellow lantern?

619
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:40,660
Ah, here it is!

620
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:49,600
Goodness, her handwriting is pretty.

621
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:53,870
What did she write?

622
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:23,110
<i>I'm very happy now,
thanks to Choi Shin Hyung.</i>

623
00:55:23,110 --> 00:55:28,870
<i>I wish this precious time
would last forever.</i>

624
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:45,630
Aren't you going to tell me
what you wrote?

625
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:51,710
- I can tell from your expression.
- What? What is it?

626
00:55:53,110 --> 00:55:57,030
- 'I wish I'd get married this year.'
- Hey.

627
00:55:57,030 --> 00:56:00,760
- How many days are left in this year?
- If you like him, go for it.

628
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,410
Why take it slow?

629
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:12,940
<i>Can I see you real quick?</i>

630
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:35,230
Hey, you're here.

631
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:39,460
Man, you weren't even surprised?

632
00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:45,580
What's all this, huh?

633
00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:52,910
Is everything okay?

634
00:56:54,890 --> 00:56:59,290
It'll take about two hours.
Is that okay?

635
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:02,350
Yes, I'm okay with that.

636
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:05,030
What is it?

637
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:26,290
<i>- [Let's start.]</i>
- Gosh, he even makes me do this now?

638
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:38,710
Choi Shin Hyung.

639
00:57:38,710 --> 00:57:41,470
It's a movie I wanted to see with you.

640
00:57:41,470 --> 00:57:45,170
I chose it on my own without asking you.

641
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:48,180
Do you like it?

642
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:51,440
Will it be okay even if it's boring?

643
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:01,580
Wait, isn't Alain Delon in this movie?

644
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:04,260
How did you know that?
Have you seen it?

645
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:06,420
No.

646
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:10,480
I haven't seen it,
but my late father really liked it.

647
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:14,200
I see. He did, huh?

648
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:20,360
<i>I'm very happy now,
thanks to Choi Shin Hyung.</i>

649
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:26,560
<i>I wish this precious moment
would last forever.</i>

650
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:29,360
How was it?

651
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:34,070
Was it interesting?

652
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:14,710
