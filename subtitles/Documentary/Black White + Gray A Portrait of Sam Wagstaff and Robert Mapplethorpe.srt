1
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,225
{y:i}John Wilson.
{y:i}A violent man given to violent action.

2
00:00:54,642 --> 00:00:59,230
{y:i}Some ascribed his wild and troubled life
{y:i}to his personal mania for self-destruction.

3
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:02,567
{y:i}These generalizations always seemed
{y:i}inaccurate to me.

4
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,382
{y:i}That's why I had to write all this about John.

5
00:01:05,486 --> 00:01:08,093
{y:i}A brilliant, screw-you-all type filmmaker...

6
00:01:08,198 --> 00:01:12,785
{y:i}...who continually violated all the unwritten
{y:i}laws of the motion picture business...

7
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:18,103
{y:i}...yet had the magic, almost divine ability
{y:i}to always land on his feet.

8
00:01:34,891 --> 00:01:36,976
Mr. Verrill?
Hello, I'm Miss Wilding.

9
00:01:37,185 --> 00:01:38,958
-How are you?
-Did you have a good flight?

10
00:01:39,062 --> 00:01:41,877
-Wonderful. Thank you.
-Mr. Wilson is expecting you.

11
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,224
-How was Switzerland?
-Switzerland? Fine.

12
00:01:55,432 --> 00:01:56,997
Eggerton Gardens, please.

13
00:01:57,622 --> 00:01:58,873
Yes, ma'am.

14
00:01:59,499 --> 00:02:02,002
-I thought he was at Claridge's.
-He was.

15
00:02:02,419 --> 00:02:03,983
He's got a house now.

16
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:06,798
One of his society friends loaned it to him.

17
00:02:07,215 --> 00:02:08,884
You know what John is.

18
00:02:10,656 --> 00:02:12,742
I mean, Mr. Wilson.

19
00:02:37,871 --> 00:02:40,999
Hello, George. This is Mr. Verrill.
Is Mr. Wilson up yet?

20
00:02:41,103 --> 00:02:44,649
Oh, yes. He's been up hours.
Been riding.

21
00:02:45,691 --> 00:02:47,672
He's having his breakfast now.

22
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:13,949
Come in.

23
00:03:23,229 --> 00:03:25,314
Mr. Verrill is here, Mr. Wilson.

24
00:03:28,964 --> 00:03:30,632
-Pete!
-Johnny!

25
00:03:30,841 --> 00:03:32,196
For God's sake!

26
00:03:33,031 --> 00:03:35,012
-How the hell are you?
-All right.

27
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,784
Well, you're looking good, kid.

28
00:03:36,993 --> 00:03:40,225
-What have you been up to?
-Skiing and sitting in the sun.

29
00:03:40,434 --> 00:03:41,685
Isn't that swell?

30
00:03:41,894 --> 00:03:44,188
-I missed you, kid.
-I missed you too, John.

31
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:45,439
-Same old Pete.
-Yeah.

32
00:03:45,647 --> 00:03:47,316
-Care for some coffee?
-I'm fine.

33
00:03:47,524 --> 00:03:49,610
-This is some joint you got.
-Isn't it?

34
00:03:49,714 --> 00:03:52,529
-Did you get a load of the living room?
-Did I ever!

35
00:03:52,738 --> 00:03:55,240
Isn't it the most hideous thing?
I'm crazy about it.

36
00:03:55,345 --> 00:03:59,411
Miss Wilding, you can get the hell
out of here. There's no work today.

37
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,435
Well, what do you think of this outfit?

38
00:04:02,644 --> 00:04:05,876
Hey, that's some getup
you got there, Johnny.

39
00:04:06,085 --> 00:04:07,440
Of course it is.

40
00:04:07,544 --> 00:04:09,734
Now, what about you?
What about the book?

41
00:04:09,943 --> 00:04:12,028
I didn't get very much done on the book.

42
00:04:12,237 --> 00:04:14,322
Why? Or would you prefer
not to talk about it?

43
00:04:14,531 --> 00:04:16,512
I don't mind. I just couldn't get started.

44
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,119
An then when I did,
I got hooked up with some dame.

45
00:04:19,848 --> 00:04:21,934
-Hell, isn't it?
-It sure is.

46
00:04:22,038 --> 00:04:25,583
And once it's over, you can't figure out
why it all seemed so damn important.

47
00:04:25,792 --> 00:04:27,982
There's nothing tougher
than trying to remember...

48
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:30,276
...why you chased a dame
once you've had her.

49
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,821
Yeah, I'll say. And I didn't get
much skiing done because of her.

50
00:04:33,925 --> 00:04:37,887
Well, that's a shame. I think I've got
the cure for that, though: Africa.

51
00:04:38,096 --> 00:04:40,703
You come down there with me
and you work on this script.

52
00:04:40,807 --> 00:04:45,186
-You really think that's gonna help me?
-Even if it doesn't, you've got to do it.

53
00:04:45,395 --> 00:04:49,879
There are times when you can't wonder
whether it's the right or wrong thing to do.

54
00:04:49,983 --> 00:04:53,632
Not for guys like you and me, kid.
You just gotta pack up and go.

55
00:04:56,969 --> 00:04:58,742
I gotta get started on this book.

56
00:04:58,846 --> 00:05:01,140
If you didn't write it before,
you weren't ready.

57
00:05:01,244 --> 00:05:03,538
-You think so?
-I know so.

58
00:05:03,747 --> 00:05:05,624
Well, when do you plan on leaving?

59
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:09,899
In a week or 10 days. We'll work here
and then we'll get our shots and take off.

60
00:05:10,107 --> 00:05:13,653
-And who's gonna be in this picture?
-We have Phil Duncan and Kay Gibson.

61
00:05:13,757 --> 00:05:16,364
That's good. How long are you
planning on staying there?

62
00:05:16,572 --> 00:05:19,596
Oh, four or five months.
Long enough to make a picture.

63
00:05:19,805 --> 00:05:22,307
-And have ourselves a safari.
-Safari?

64
00:05:22,516 --> 00:05:24,810
Yeah, haven't you ever wanted
to shoot an elephant?

65
00:05:25,018 --> 00:05:27,833
-No, I don't think so, John.
-Well, a lion or a buffalo.

66
00:05:27,938 --> 00:05:30,023
This is a safari, kid. The real thing.

67
00:05:30,232 --> 00:05:32,526
-Who's gonna pay for all this?
-Don't worry.

68
00:05:32,734 --> 00:05:34,715
What's your financial situation?

69
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,218
-It remains unchanged.
-So you're broke?

70
00:05:37,739 --> 00:05:40,450
Depends on what you call broke.
I owe a quarter million.

71
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:43,057
-Quarter of a million?
-Closer to 300,000.

72
00:05:43,266 --> 00:05:47,854
-$300,000, John, and you're not worried?
-I think about it now and then.

73
00:05:48,271 --> 00:05:50,565
-Do you see a way out?
-This picture.

74
00:05:50,773 --> 00:05:52,754
Now do you see why
I want to go to Africa?

75
00:05:52,859 --> 00:05:56,300
I've got nothing else to lose.
Even if a lion or a buffalo gets me...

76
00:05:56,404 --> 00:05:58,594
...my last minute on earth
will be a happy one.

77
00:05:59,219 --> 00:06:02,869
I'll just think of my creditors when they
find out I've been eaten alive...

78
00:06:03,077 --> 00:06:05,997
...and it'll all seem worthwhile.

79
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:09,334
Okay, okay, John. How about a script?

80
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:12,983
There's one around here somewhere.
We don't have a title yet.

81
00:06:13,087 --> 00:06:16,215
It's called African Trader
or African something.

82
00:06:16,424 --> 00:06:17,884
Miss Wilding?

83
00:06:21,742 --> 00:06:24,244
Where's a copy of that goddamned script?

84
00:06:24,453 --> 00:06:25,913
I haven't seen it, John.

85
00:06:26,121 --> 00:06:29,771
Then find it. What kind of a secretary
are you? What do you do all day?

86
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:32,586
I've been typing your letters
and answering the telephone.

87
00:06:32,795 --> 00:06:34,567
-Balls.
-I have.

88
00:06:34,776 --> 00:06:37,070
You were competent
when you first got here.

89
00:06:37,278 --> 00:06:40,824
Now you just hang around all day
spying for Paul Landers.

90
00:06:41,032 --> 00:06:44,577
It's not true. I don't spy for anybody.
Especially Mr. Landers.

91
00:06:44,577 --> 00:06:45,933
Find the script, then.

92
00:06:46,037 --> 00:06:48,852
We have a meeting with Landers
and his money men in an hour.

93
00:06:48,957 --> 00:06:50,416
Right.

94
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:53,962
-Paul Landers is producing this?
-That's right.

95
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:56,464
And you know why I agreed
to work with him again?

96
00:06:56,673 --> 00:06:57,820
No.

97
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:01,469
Because it's the wrong thing to do.

98
00:07:04,702 --> 00:07:07,830
-I'm so glad to see you, Pete.
-It's good to see you, Paul.

99
00:07:08,038 --> 00:07:11,271
-You can save all our lives.
-How's that?

100
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:14,607
-The monster. I think he's losing his mind.
-He's in fine shape.

101
00:07:14,816 --> 00:07:18,153
You've only been with him half a day.
You don't know what he's been like.

102
00:07:18,361 --> 00:07:20,655
He's almost killed the deal five times.

103
00:07:20,864 --> 00:07:23,158
The only reason it's still alive
is because of me.

104
00:07:23,158 --> 00:07:26,077
-He wants to go to Africa.
-Paul, how the hell are you?

105
00:07:26,286 --> 00:07:29,518
Johnny boy! Did you have a good day?
Get a lot done?

106
00:07:29,727 --> 00:07:32,542
Hell, no. But Pete and I
did have a nice chat.

107
00:07:32,751 --> 00:07:35,253
-What do you think of the script?
-I haven't read it yet.

108
00:07:35,462 --> 00:07:38,173
-I think it's awfully good.
-You do?

109
00:07:38,381 --> 00:07:41,822
Well, it's a shame you don't know
a damn thing about it.

110
00:07:42,969 --> 00:07:44,950
-You see?
-He's always been like that.

111
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:46,619
No, he's worse. He's insane.

112
00:07:46,827 --> 00:07:50,268
In a well-ordered society,
he'd be in a straitjacket right now.

113
00:07:50,894 --> 00:07:54,126
Where the question of color is concerned,
it's an extra expense.

114
00:07:54,335 --> 00:07:56,420
As far as I'm concerned,
of questionable value.

115
00:07:56,629 --> 00:07:58,819
-I quite agree.
-Well, I don't.

116
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,781
Color's worth a million dollars
at the box office.

117
00:08:02,885 --> 00:08:05,075
Well, that's not important.

118
00:08:05,179 --> 00:08:10,080
What I'm trying to find out from Basil is
how much color complicates our operation.

119
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,853
Well, I'm afraid it does, John.

120
00:08:11,957 --> 00:08:15,293
The camera is much heavier.
There are many more lighting problems.

121
00:08:15,502 --> 00:08:19,047
I'm telling you, color is essential
to the success of this venture.

122
00:08:19,256 --> 00:08:22,488
I'm not concerned with the success
of the venture at this moment.

123
00:08:22,697 --> 00:08:24,469
I just don't want to get bogged down.

124
00:08:24,678 --> 00:08:26,972
-Bogged down?
-Bogged down?

125
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:31,456
Yes, I know how easy it is to get bogged
down with a company on location.

126
00:08:32,394 --> 00:08:35,522
-Have you ever been bogged down, John?
-No.

127
00:08:35,731 --> 00:08:38,859
-Then why bring it up?
-I think it's a very valid point.

128
00:08:39,067 --> 00:08:40,110
Well, I don't.

129
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,404
Well, of course you don't, Paul.

130
00:08:42,613 --> 00:08:45,741
Because while we're in Africa,
sweating and killing ourselves...

131
00:08:45,949 --> 00:08:48,556
...you'll be in Paris sending out memos.

132
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,059
That's not true.
I'll be there in Africa with you.

133
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:52,623
Like hell you will.

134
00:08:52,831 --> 00:08:57,315
If the picture was shot in a river in England,
and the second unit sent out to Africa...

135
00:08:57,523 --> 00:09:00,234
...then the risk of using color
would be greatly minimized.

136
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:04,093
-That would be with some other director.
-We have already discussed that.

137
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,178
Oh, we have, have we?

138
00:09:07,533 --> 00:09:11,287
John, could I talk to you
in the bedroom for a moment?

139
00:09:14,624 --> 00:09:19,212
-What's this bullshit about another director?
-You know I wouldn't do that to you.

140
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,444
You'd sell your mother
down the river to make a deal.

141
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:26,615
What the hell is the matter with you, John?
Do you want to kill this project?

142
00:09:27,137 --> 00:09:29,222
No. No, I don't.

143
00:09:29,326 --> 00:09:34,331
Then why bring up the possibility of bogging
down? You scared the bejesus out of them!

144
00:09:34,957 --> 00:09:38,815
Then telling them that you'd quit if the
picture wasn't made in Africa. Good God!

145
00:09:39,023 --> 00:09:42,464
If one frame of this picture
is shot in England, I will quit.

146
00:09:42,673 --> 00:09:44,654
But it won't be.

147
00:09:44,758 --> 00:09:47,782
But you discussed it behind my back,
you son of a bitch.

148
00:09:47,991 --> 00:09:53,309
I didn't mention it because there isn't
a chance it could be done that way.

149
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:56,124
You'll guarantee that, I suppose?

150
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:59,148
Yes, goddamn it. I guarantee it!

151
00:10:00,086 --> 00:10:02,589
Well, your guarantee doesn't mean
a damn thing to me.

152
00:10:02,797 --> 00:10:06,864
I'm not gonna make some fake,
crappy mess just to please you.

153
00:10:07,072 --> 00:10:10,618
So I don't care if this picture's shot
in black and white or sepia tone...

154
00:10:10,722 --> 00:10:13,329
...or we have to make
the whole damn thing in animation.

155
00:10:13,433 --> 00:10:15,831
Pete and I are going to Africa.

156
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:30,534
-What's the effective range of this thing?
-About 100 yards, sir. Not much more.

157
00:10:30,742 --> 00:10:33,245
That's plenty for your buff
and your elephant.

158
00:10:33,453 --> 00:10:35,122
They kill them at 20 yards, kid.

159
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:38,562
Well, even closer than that sometimes,
so they tell me.

160
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:42,525
Of course, I've never been to Africa,
but this man has.

161
00:10:42,733 --> 00:10:44,193
Makes for invaluable reading.

162
00:10:44,402 --> 00:10:46,904
John Taylor.
{y:i}Big Game and Big Game Rifles.

163
00:10:47,008 --> 00:10:50,449
-We'll need two of these.
-We'll take two of these rifles right here...

164
00:10:50,658 --> 00:10:53,682
...and two of the smaller ones,
the Mannlichers 256.

165
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:56,080
And that's to shoot for the pot,
so to speak.

166
00:10:56,184 --> 00:11:00,459
-And then one 12-gauge shotgun.
-Always a useful thing to have along, sir.

167
00:11:00,668 --> 00:11:02,128
And cartridges, of course.

168
00:11:02,232 --> 00:11:07,133
-How many rounds, sir?
-Two hundred. Two hundred per weapon.

169
00:11:07,341 --> 00:11:09,844
-Planning to be away quite a while, sir.
-Yes.

170
00:11:09,948 --> 00:11:13,181
And Sunrise Films will send you the check.

171
00:11:16,204 --> 00:11:18,081
John! Be careful!

172
00:11:21,522 --> 00:11:25,068
Irene. For God's sake,
what are you doing here?

173
00:11:30,281 --> 00:11:32,367
You told me to meet you here.

174
00:11:32,575 --> 00:11:35,495
We had an appointment.
Drinks and dinner.

175
00:11:37,893 --> 00:11:39,978
-I dressed.
-Yes.

176
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:44,983
Well, it plain slipped my mind.
Irene Saunders, this is Pete Verrill.

177
00:11:45,192 --> 00:11:46,235
Hello.

178
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,467
I admired your last book enormously.

179
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:51,761
I'm a writer too.

180
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:55,619
John's promised to listen to an idea
I had for a film this evening.

181
00:11:55,723 --> 00:11:57,392
I do hope you'll join us.

182
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,563
You can give me a few pointers.
One writer to another.

183
00:12:07,715 --> 00:12:12,094
It's about a dog. A puppy dog.
He's the hero, the star.

184
00:12:12,824 --> 00:12:16,578
Imagine, John, over the opening credits,
we'll see Horace.

185
00:12:16,682 --> 00:12:20,540
Wonderful, adorable dissolves
of Horace. In close-up. In long shot.

186
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,877
Now, this is the part of the script
I'm not sure about.

187
00:12:23,981 --> 00:12:27,526
The censors might cut it.
It turns out that Horace is in heat.

188
00:12:27,735 --> 00:12:30,550
-Horace?
-It's a story of mistaken identity.

189
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:34,304
You see, Horace has a twin. A bitch.
She's called Geraldine.

190
00:12:34,512 --> 00:12:39,413
Now, it's she that's in heat.
Isn't that a wonderful switch?

191
00:12:44,001 --> 00:12:50,362
We'll cut from the Hyde Park sequence,
John, to an early-morning shot of the river.

192
00:12:50,362 --> 00:12:52,030
The river.

193
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:57,661
Horace is alone now. We dolly with him
as he trots slowly down a deserted street.

194
00:12:57,869 --> 00:13:00,372
-He turns into Grosvenor--
-What are you doing here?

195
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,978
I have found a copy of the script.

196
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:07,358
-I hope you like it as much as I do.
-I'm sure I will.

197
00:13:07,462 --> 00:13:09,235
Peter! Please.

198
00:13:09,443 --> 00:13:11,633
You must hear the ending.

199
00:13:11,842 --> 00:13:16,221
Horace is all alone. Now, we'll dolly with him
as he trots slowly down a deserted street.

200
00:13:16,325 --> 00:13:18,828
Now, from another angle...

201
00:13:19,036 --> 00:13:21,643
...Geraldine can be seen
coming down Brook Street.

202
00:13:21,852 --> 00:13:24,563
She passes Claridge's,
then she enters the square.

203
00:13:25,293 --> 00:13:27,482
Suddenly, they see each other.

204
00:13:27,587 --> 00:13:30,193
Horace and Geraldine.

205
00:13:30,402 --> 00:13:34,260
There isn't a human being in sight. They
race toward each other! The music swells!

206
00:13:34,364 --> 00:13:39,369
Now, we hold the final picture
in an extreme long shot...

207
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,644
...as they meet...

208
00:13:44,374 --> 00:13:46,355
...turn...

209
00:13:47,502 --> 00:13:49,379
...and go off together.

210
00:13:54,176 --> 00:13:56,470
They've only just begun to live.

211
00:13:57,721 --> 00:13:59,181
Well, that's the end.

212
00:14:02,413 --> 00:14:04,290
They find each other.

213
00:14:08,357 --> 00:14:12,736
Well, isn't that something?
Isn't that something?

214
00:14:14,717 --> 00:14:16,281
Do you really like it?

215
00:14:17,533 --> 00:14:20,452
Well, darling, it's swell.

216
00:14:20,661 --> 00:14:23,163
Come on, we'll talk some more.

217
00:14:24,102 --> 00:14:25,666
Pete.

218
00:14:27,647 --> 00:14:30,671
If there's half as much love
in this old gal as there is talk...

219
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:33,173
...l may be dead in the morning.

220
00:14:42,453 --> 00:14:43,913
Hey, Johnny.

221
00:14:44,122 --> 00:14:45,790
-Morning.
-Morning.

222
00:14:46,624 --> 00:14:48,918
You look like you've been
run through the wringer.

223
00:14:49,127 --> 00:14:51,004
Just part of me.

224
00:14:52,046 --> 00:14:55,383
What's happening, kid?
What do you think of the script?

225
00:14:55,592 --> 00:14:57,781
Well, I'll tell you the truth. I like it.

226
00:14:57,886 --> 00:14:59,450
-I like it a lot.
-Good.

227
00:14:59,658 --> 00:15:03,933
It's original, it's exciting and it's moving.
I just have one little problem with it.

228
00:15:04,663 --> 00:15:06,123
The ending.

229
00:15:06,227 --> 00:15:09,668
-You don't like the ending?
-No, I didn't say I don't like the ending.

230
00:15:09,877 --> 00:15:13,109
I'm just not sure that it's the right one.

231
00:15:14,361 --> 00:15:17,384
Let me put it in Hollywood terms.
I think it's too downbeat.

232
00:15:17,593 --> 00:15:19,678
After everything
these two have gone through:

233
00:15:19,887 --> 00:15:23,224
They fought the river,
tropical storms, the Germans....

234
00:15:23,432 --> 00:15:28,124
And just when you've set the audience up
for a wonderfully comic ending...

235
00:15:28,229 --> 00:15:31,357
...you blow the ship up and kill everybody.

236
00:15:31,774 --> 00:15:34,381
Well, Pete, there's an old saying:

237
00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:36,570
"God makes a man before he kills him."

238
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:40,845
I've heard it, John. I've heard it.
But I don't think it applies in this case.

239
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:43,452
You're beating the audience
over the head, John.

240
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:47,519
People don't go to see pictures
to be lectured to.

241
00:15:47,727 --> 00:15:50,334
Tell me, Pete. Do you own
a percentage of this film?

242
00:15:50,543 --> 00:15:51,690
No.

243
00:15:52,211 --> 00:15:55,131
Then why are you so concerned
about the damn audience?

244
00:15:55,652 --> 00:15:58,259
Because we're in show business, John.

245
00:15:58,467 --> 00:16:02,638
Not me. And not you, either,
when we work together.

246
00:16:02,847 --> 00:16:04,619
You see, we're gods, Pete.

247
00:16:04,724 --> 00:16:08,477
Lousy little gods who control
the lives of the people we create.

248
00:16:08,477 --> 00:16:12,544
We sit up in some heavenly place
and decide whether they live or die...

249
00:16:12,648 --> 00:16:17,862
...on the merits of what happens to them
in reel one, two, three, et cetera.

250
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:20,364
And then we decide
if they have the right to live.

251
00:16:20,573 --> 00:16:23,388
And that's how we arrive at our ending.

252
00:16:23,597 --> 00:16:28,080
Well, that's what you say, John.
But I say I'm a swell god.

253
00:16:28,289 --> 00:16:31,834
I say they should live because of everything
they've gone through together.

254
00:16:32,043 --> 00:16:37,256
This world doesn't necessarily have to be
a hopeless and rotten place, John.

255
00:16:37,465 --> 00:16:41,219
We're not all destined and doomed to die
of radium poisoning.

256
00:16:41,427 --> 00:16:43,304
Now, I might be completely wrong...

257
00:16:45,494 --> 00:16:48,205
...but that's what makes me a swell god.

258
00:16:48,309 --> 00:16:52,793
-That makes you a flea on an elephant's ass.
-Oh, balls to your pessimism.

259
00:16:54,148 --> 00:16:58,215
You know something? You're never gonna be
a good screenwriter, and you know why?

260
00:16:58,423 --> 00:17:00,613
No, John. Why don't you tell me why?

261
00:17:00,822 --> 00:17:04,680
Because you let 85 million popcorn eaters
pull you this way and that way.

262
00:17:04,784 --> 00:17:07,912
To write a movie, you must forget
anyone's ever going to see it.

263
00:17:08,016 --> 00:17:10,415
You're gonna make damn sure
nobody sees this one.

264
00:17:10,623 --> 00:17:14,481
Well, maybe I am. But I figure
there's two ways to live in this world.

265
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:18,444
One is you can crawl and kiss ass
and write their happy endings...

266
00:17:18,548 --> 00:17:23,240
...sign their long-term contracts and never
take a chance on anything and never fly...

267
00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:27,202
...never leave Hollywood. Save all
your goddamn money, every cent of it.

268
00:17:27,411 --> 00:17:30,956
And then when you're a healthy-looking 50,
you die of a stroke...

269
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:35,023
...because whatever was wild in you
has eaten away the muscles of your heart.

270
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:39,089
The other way is to let the chips
fall where they may.

271
00:17:39,298 --> 00:17:43,886
Refuse to sign their contracts and
tell off the guy who can cut your throat...

272
00:17:44,094 --> 00:17:47,431
...and flatter the little guy
who's hanging by a thread that you hold.

273
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,142
John, maybe you shouldn't be
in the picture business.

274
00:17:50,246 --> 00:17:53,166
Well, maybe you're right, kid.
Maybe I shouldn't.

275
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:57,024
Maybe I should've wandered the planet
gambling on oil wells...

276
00:17:57,233 --> 00:18:00,465
...or stolen diamonds
or pimped for maharajahs.

277
00:18:00,465 --> 00:18:03,280
Maybe you should've
but you know why you didn't?

278
00:18:03,385 --> 00:18:07,973
Because somewhere deep inside of you
is a small, tiny spark of hope.

279
00:18:08,181 --> 00:18:10,058
Hope, hell.

280
00:18:10,267 --> 00:18:15,272
I'll die broke in a downtown Los Angeles
flophouse. And I won't be bitter.

281
00:18:15,584 --> 00:18:19,547
I'll have contributed maybe five,
1 0 damn good pictures.

282
00:18:19,755 --> 00:18:23,092
They'll name a special Academy Award
for me. And you know something?

283
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:27,367
All the wrong guys will get it.
And I'll be in hell, laughing my ass off.

284
00:18:29,557 --> 00:18:31,434
Romantic futility.

285
00:18:31,642 --> 00:18:34,457
-Your one true love.
-Nothing to be ashamed of, kid.

286
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,334
No, no, no, I didn't say that.

287
00:18:36,543 --> 00:18:39,045
But I admit, you are right
about the ending, John.

288
00:18:39,254 --> 00:18:42,382
I think you should kill them all
and blow everything up!

289
00:18:43,112 --> 00:18:46,136
I knew you'd ultimately see it my way.

290
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:48,743
Morning, boys.

291
00:18:48,847 --> 00:18:50,932
If it isn't the producer, right on cue.

292
00:18:51,037 --> 00:18:54,061
I have just come from a meeting...

293
00:18:54,061 --> 00:18:58,231
...and I think the financial deal is finally set.

294
00:18:58,336 --> 00:19:01,360
-Good. When do I get my take?
-Oh, you'll get it.

295
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,592
-I'm glad to see you boys have been working.
-No, we're not working.

296
00:19:04,696 --> 00:19:07,199
We're just warming up,
doing some mental calisthenics.

297
00:19:08,137 --> 00:19:10,848
Well, if you take my advice,
you'll start with the ending.

298
00:19:11,161 --> 00:19:12,829
Oh, yeah?

299
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:15,958
Now, look, Paul. Don't you go
interfering with the script.

300
00:19:16,062 --> 00:19:18,669
And don't try to influence my writer, either.

301
00:19:18,877 --> 00:19:20,650
You're an obscene man.

302
00:19:20,858 --> 00:19:23,882
You witnessed the cultural disintegration
of central Europe...

303
00:19:24,091 --> 00:19:28,053
...and you nevertheless persist on following
the same cheap, disastrous course...

304
00:19:28,262 --> 00:19:30,138
...that led to Hitler over Europe...

305
00:19:30,347 --> 00:19:33,997
...World War ll and the atomic bomb.

306
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,437
Meaning the ending stays as it is.

307
00:19:38,272 --> 00:19:43,068
Except for one minor change.
The Germans kill you too. Over the end title.

308
00:19:46,509 --> 00:19:48,595
Do you have a coat
or something I could borrow?

309
00:19:48,803 --> 00:19:49,950
-Oh, Irene.
-Excuse me.

310
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:51,618
I can't go out dressed like this.

311
00:19:51,827 --> 00:19:55,998
Irene, I'd like you to meet my partner.
Paul Landers, our producer.

312
00:19:56,102 --> 00:19:59,230
Irene has the most wonderful idea
for a film, Paul.

313
00:19:59,439 --> 00:20:02,046
Why don't you tell it to Paul
while Pete and I work?

314
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,027
Start from the beginning, darling.

315
00:20:04,235 --> 00:20:07,780
It's about a dog. A puppy dog.
He's the hero, the star.

316
00:20:07,989 --> 00:20:09,240
The dog's name is Horace.

317
00:20:09,449 --> 00:20:11,951
Pete, I should've sent you back
to Switzerland!

318
00:20:12,473 --> 00:20:15,392
I love Paul. He's such a desperate man.

319
00:21:11,595 --> 00:21:15,453
-Are you coming to Africa with us, Peter?
-Yes, I am, Kay.

320
00:21:15,661 --> 00:21:19,936
Thank God. Did you hear that?
Peter's coming with us.

321
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:23,482
At least we'll have one sane,
reasonable person along.

322
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:29,216
Won't it be wonderful? I can't wait.

323
00:21:29,425 --> 00:21:31,823
I've never looked forward
to anything as much.

324
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:34,743
I just hope John finds us
somewhere comfortable to stay.

325
00:21:35,264 --> 00:21:38,392
Not too comfortable.
I should like to rough it a little.

326
00:21:38,601 --> 00:21:40,895
I'm sure John will make sure
you get your wish.

327
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:44,961
Probably get us off in some terrible hole
and watch us suffer.

328
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:48,507
How's the script?
How's the script coming along?

329
00:21:48,715 --> 00:21:51,009
The script? Fine, Kay.
I think you'll like it.

330
00:21:52,782 --> 00:21:54,242
Kay.

331
00:21:58,204 --> 00:22:00,915
I would like to propose a toast...

332
00:22:01,124 --> 00:22:05,816
...on behalf of John and myself,
to our British partners!

333
00:22:07,588 --> 00:22:09,882
Hands across the sea!

334
00:22:10,508 --> 00:22:11,759
Cheers!

335
00:22:12,385 --> 00:22:14,157
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

336
00:22:17,286 --> 00:22:19,684
And I also would like to propose a toast...

337
00:22:19,684 --> 00:22:22,916
...to my partner and our producer,
Paul Landers.

338
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:27,191
Paul, I hope I don't have to kill you
before this picture's finished.

339
00:22:31,571 --> 00:22:33,552
To Kay.

340
00:22:34,282 --> 00:22:37,201
And to Phil and his lovely blushing bride.

341
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:41,581
And to Pete, probably the best skier
in the Screenwriters Guild...

342
00:22:41,685 --> 00:22:44,083
...and the only man
I know who can keep up with me.

343
00:22:45,022 --> 00:22:47,733
The only man I know
who's capable of the dangerous life...

344
00:22:47,837 --> 00:22:51,799
...because now he's making a move
on the producer's girlfriend.

345
00:22:52,321 --> 00:22:55,553
And that's right, honey.
He's hung like a stud horse.

346
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:50,504
Now, doesn't that make you long
for the Dark Continent?

347
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,827
-Thank you, dear.
-Bye-bye.

348
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:28,311
Feel the mystery of it, kid?

349
00:25:38,634 --> 00:25:41,971
-Hello, John. You have a good trip?
-A little bit long, I'd say.

350
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:44,786
John, may I introduce
squadron leader Alec Laing.

351
00:25:46,141 --> 00:25:48,852
-And Ralph Lockhart, our unit manager.
-Hello.

352
00:25:49,791 --> 00:25:53,440
This is Pete Verrill.
Tom Harrison, our art director.

353
00:25:53,649 --> 00:25:55,630
-Squadron leader Laing.
-Mr. Laing.

354
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:59,280
-And yours...?
-Lockhart. Ralph Lockhart.

355
00:25:59,384 --> 00:26:00,739
Of course you are.

356
00:26:01,574 --> 00:26:03,868
Well, gentlemen,
shall we get in out of the sun?

357
00:26:04,076 --> 00:26:06,996
You chaps must be about ready
for a bath and a drink.

358
00:26:07,309 --> 00:26:10,228
I'll take care of the luggage
and see you later at the hotel.

359
00:26:10,749 --> 00:26:13,565
Well, the drink part
certainly sounds good to me.

360
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,347
Get out of the way!

361
00:26:26,286 --> 00:26:27,954
Stupid buggers!

362
00:26:35,775 --> 00:26:37,652
Get out of the way!

363
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:42,239
They knock off about 10 of them
a month along this road.

364
00:26:42,448 --> 00:26:46,098
It doesn't seem to make the slightest
bloody impression on them, though.

365
00:26:46,202 --> 00:26:48,079
Is that so?

366
00:26:54,022 --> 00:26:56,942
Will you get out of the bloody way?

367
00:27:31,664 --> 00:27:35,209
Hello, I'm Harry Longthorne,
general manager of the Lake Victoria Hotel.

368
00:27:35,418 --> 00:27:38,442
-Harry.
-I'll show you to your rooms.

369
00:27:43,968 --> 00:27:47,409
-Excuse me, Mr. Verrill, do you play soccer?
-Yes, I do. Why?

370
00:27:47,618 --> 00:27:51,059
We're having the annual staff soccer game.
We're minus one white.

371
00:27:51,267 --> 00:27:52,936
-Would you be interested?
-Certainly.

372
00:27:53,144 --> 00:27:56,481
-We'll have a practice the Saturday before.
-All right.

373
00:27:57,419 --> 00:27:59,817
Pete, this is Mrs. Margaret MacGregor.

374
00:27:59,922 --> 00:28:01,903
-Pleasure to meet you.
-And Mr. Marlowe.

375
00:28:02,111 --> 00:28:06,074
He's a licensed white hunter.
Pete's a crack shot, Marine-trained.

376
00:28:06,282 --> 00:28:07,742
Sit down, have a drink, kid.

377
00:28:08,785 --> 00:28:10,140
I'll have an iced tea, please.

378
00:28:10,349 --> 00:28:12,851
Oh, come on, don't embarrass me.
Give him a beer.

379
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,833
I'll have a beer, please.

380
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:17,544
We are interested in getting
a couple of elephants.

381
00:28:18,586 --> 00:28:21,402
An elephant is dangerous
because he's such a hearty bugger.

382
00:28:21,506 --> 00:28:24,008
To kill him, you have to hit him
in one of two places.

383
00:28:24,217 --> 00:28:26,198
Between the eyes or in the heart.

384
00:28:26,302 --> 00:28:30,682
Not right between the eyes.
Down about six inches.

385
00:28:37,042 --> 00:28:38,711
"There's been silence for hours now.

386
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:43,090
She's sitting on the back, reading the Bible.
He's still working on the engine.

387
00:28:43,299 --> 00:28:49,138
Finally he says, 'Miss, I'm sorry
I got drunk. I apologize.

388
00:28:49,346 --> 00:28:52,370
What more can a man do
than say he's sorry?'

389
00:28:52,579 --> 00:28:55,811
She says, 'It's not only your drinking
I'm upset about.

390
00:28:55,915 --> 00:28:57,897
You promised to go downriver.'

391
00:28:58,731 --> 00:29:01,650
He says, 'Miss, listen to me and understand.

392
00:29:01,859 --> 00:29:04,987
There's death a dozen times over
down that river.'

393
00:29:05,196 --> 00:29:09,262
She says, 'You promised.'
He says, 'I'm taking the promise back!'

394
00:29:09,784 --> 00:29:11,139
Silence.

395
00:29:12,182 --> 00:29:16,353
She picks up the Bible, starts reading
again, completely ignoring him.

396
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,566
Now he can't take the silence any longer.
Finally he says, 'All right, miss. You win...

397
00:29:21,775 --> 00:29:24,694
...which I'm sure the crocodiles
will be happy to hear.

398
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,031
Down the river we go."'

399
00:29:32,202 --> 00:29:34,392
Well, what do you think, John?

400
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,563
Not bad. But you're trying
to complicate it, Pete.

401
00:29:38,667 --> 00:29:40,752
Things are always good
if they're left simple.

402
00:29:40,856 --> 00:29:42,108
No, not always.

403
00:29:42,525 --> 00:29:46,383
Always. That's what creates truly
important art, is simplicity.

404
00:29:46,591 --> 00:29:48,885
John, there are no rules to art.

405
00:29:49,302 --> 00:29:52,118
There are hundreds of rules.
Hemingway understood that.

406
00:29:52,326 --> 00:29:55,350
That's why he always reduced life
to its simplest terms.

407
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:59,208
Whether it's courage,
fear, impotence, death.

408
00:29:59,834 --> 00:30:04,526
People's lives just sort of unfold, and things
just happen to them one thing after another.

409
00:30:04,735 --> 00:30:07,550
They were never bogged down
with that nonsense of subplot...

410
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:10,782
...that we sweated over in the past.

411
00:30:11,617 --> 00:30:16,517
Stendhal understood that.
Flaubert. Tolstoy. Melville.

412
00:30:16,622 --> 00:30:18,811
Simplicity is what made them great.

413
00:30:19,124 --> 00:30:22,669
No, Pete. Don't complicate it.
You'll just be wasting your time.

414
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:24,963
Wasting my time?

415
00:30:25,172 --> 00:30:29,447
I'm wasting my time trying to make the
script better? Isn't that why I'm here, John?

416
00:30:29,656 --> 00:30:31,845
And I think it's damn good.

417
00:30:32,471 --> 00:30:36,225
Well, I just wish the damn script
were finished...

418
00:30:36,329 --> 00:30:38,831
...so you and I could go on safari.

419
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:43,107
Safari? I thought we were gonna finish
the film first and then go on safari.

420
00:30:43,524 --> 00:30:46,235
If we wait till the film is finished,
we'll never get to it.

421
00:30:46,443 --> 00:30:49,363
We'll finish the script,
then go on safari...

422
00:30:49,571 --> 00:30:53,638
...then we'll shoot the film
after we've shot our elephants.

423
00:30:58,226 --> 00:30:59,999
Damn lake flies.

424
00:31:00,207 --> 00:31:02,501
Good job they don't bite.

425
00:31:31,071 --> 00:31:32,844
Come on, whites!

426
00:31:33,783 --> 00:31:36,285
There's a spare man in the middle!

427
00:31:40,352 --> 00:31:43,793
-He tripped over my arm! Please.
-That was a fault.

428
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:52,447
-That was a fault. Let's go!
-How can that be a penalty?

429
00:31:53,386 --> 00:31:56,826
-The local boys are quite good, aren't they?
-Yes.

430
00:31:56,931 --> 00:32:00,893
They went to England last year.
Of course, they didn't stand a chance.

431
00:32:01,102 --> 00:32:02,040
Why is that?

432
00:32:02,249 --> 00:32:06,732
They're clever with their feet, but against
a good British team, they're just too small.

433
00:32:06,837 --> 00:32:09,548
The old blocking and checking
throws them off.

434
00:32:09,652 --> 00:32:12,780
They don't go in for that sort
of thing at all, you see.

435
00:32:12,989 --> 00:32:15,908
Probably be lynched if they did.

436
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:19,141
We're not like you Americans.

437
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:22,164
Of course not.

438
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:40,308
-Oh, well done.
-Hell of a man, that boy. Hell of a man.

439
00:32:45,626 --> 00:32:48,128
Where is the defense?!

440
00:33:05,124 --> 00:33:08,670
What? What?
Watch it!

441
00:33:19,305 --> 00:33:20,974
You all right?

442
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:48,710
Shit!

443
00:33:50,378 --> 00:33:53,089
We found everything you wanted, John,
but it's bloody awful.

444
00:33:53,298 --> 00:33:56,322
It's no place for a man to live.
It's the thickest jungle you've ever seen.

445
00:33:56,426 --> 00:33:57,886
Looks pretty interesting, John.

446
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:01,431
There's a black-water river and a few huts.
At nighttime there are mosquitoes.

447
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:06,436
During the day it rains.
There are elephants, crocodiles, Pygmies.

448
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:11,128
-Lots of big game, is there?
-Antelope, buffalo.

449
00:34:11,232 --> 00:34:15,612
We saw an elephant from the plane
with tusks right down to the ground.

450
00:34:19,783 --> 00:34:22,494
Could you lay a plane on to take us there?

451
00:34:22,702 --> 00:34:25,101
No problem.
When you thinking of going?

452
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:27,707
Pete?

453
00:34:28,959 --> 00:34:33,338
If I can manage to keep the script simple,
two or three days.

454
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,888
Isn't this just swell...

455
00:34:42,097 --> 00:34:46,163
...dining with a beautiful lady
right in the middle of Africa?

456
00:34:46,268 --> 00:34:50,126
-Would you care for some more champagne?
-Yes, I would, rather.

457
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:53,775
Waiter, could you bring us another bottle
of champagne when you get the chance?

458
00:34:53,984 --> 00:34:56,903
-Yes. Thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

459
00:34:57,008 --> 00:35:00,240
You know,
you spoil those boys dreadfully.

460
00:35:00,449 --> 00:35:03,577
Well, as good as they play soccer,
they should be spoiled.

461
00:35:03,577 --> 00:35:06,496
They'll be impossible now
for five or six days.

462
00:35:07,122 --> 00:35:12,127
I don't think so. I think they know
the difference between sport and real life.

463
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:16,194
-So, Mrs. MacGregor--
-Margaret, please.

464
00:35:16,402 --> 00:35:20,469
Margaret.
Margaret, do you miss London?

465
00:35:21,094 --> 00:35:22,971
Yes, I do, rather.

466
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:26,099
I don't miss London as much
as I miss the country.

467
00:35:26,308 --> 00:35:30,479
Especially the winter, when you're out there
with the hounds and they have the scent...

468
00:35:30,479 --> 00:35:34,337
-...crossing a good bit of country.
-Oh, I do agree.

469
00:35:34,441 --> 00:35:36,422
I'm not keen on London.

470
00:35:36,526 --> 00:35:40,280
I had to live there during the war
and I got awfully fed up with it.

471
00:35:40,489 --> 00:35:44,764
Well, I rather enjoyed it during the war.
The people behaved so magnificently.

472
00:35:44,868 --> 00:35:49,248
They didn't all behave well.
You probably never left the West End.

473
00:35:49,352 --> 00:35:53,210
Not true, not true.
I did a film about the London Blitz.

474
00:35:53,418 --> 00:35:55,087
I was all over town.

475
00:35:55,295 --> 00:35:58,736
Well, you can't have spent much time
in Soho, where I lived.

476
00:35:59,675 --> 00:36:03,846
-Why do you say that, dear?
-I thought the people there were just horrid.

477
00:36:04,054 --> 00:36:06,557
There are an awful lot of Jews
in that neighborhood.

478
00:36:06,765 --> 00:36:09,268
-Mrs. MacGregor.
-Margaret.

479
00:36:09,476 --> 00:36:12,709
Margaret.
I must warn you, I'm a Jew.

480
00:36:13,126 --> 00:36:14,273
-You're not.
-I am.

481
00:36:14,481 --> 00:36:15,837
-No.
-Yes.

482
00:36:16,045 --> 00:36:20,738
-You're pulling my leg!
-No, I'm not pulling your leg, Margaret.

483
00:36:20,946 --> 00:36:22,510
I'm a Jew.

484
00:36:23,553 --> 00:36:25,743
I don't believe you.

485
00:36:27,307 --> 00:36:29,392
I know I shouldn't say this, but...

486
00:36:29,601 --> 00:36:32,937
...that was the one thing about which
I thought Hitler was absolutely right.

487
00:36:33,042 --> 00:36:36,170
Now, Margaret, the man has
just got through warning you.

488
00:36:36,378 --> 00:36:39,924
Because the Jews
in London were awful.

489
00:36:40,549 --> 00:36:44,303
They ran the black market.
And they didn't go into the army.

490
00:36:44,512 --> 00:36:48,057
And when they did,
they got themselves cushy jobs.

491
00:36:48,474 --> 00:36:52,228
Of course, there were upper-class Jews,
but I'm not talking about them.

492
00:36:52,436 --> 00:36:54,730
I'm talking about the kikes in Soho.

493
00:36:54,939 --> 00:36:58,484
-The foreigners.
-Margaret. Margaret.

494
00:37:00,256 --> 00:37:04,427
My grandparents were kikes.
My father and my mother were kikes.

495
00:37:06,304 --> 00:37:09,849
-And I'm a kike.
-That's right, dear.

496
00:37:10,371 --> 00:37:12,665
You're not going to tell me
that you're Jewish too?

497
00:37:12,873 --> 00:37:17,878
No. Absolutely not, because that would be
a lie, and I wouldn't want to lie to you ever.

498
00:37:18,087 --> 00:37:20,381
But I would like to tell you
a little story, though.

499
00:37:20,902 --> 00:37:22,675
I love stories.

500
00:37:22,883 --> 00:37:26,846
Well, you mustn't interrupt now, because
you're way too beautiful to interrupt people.

501
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:31,642
When I was in London
in the early '40s...

502
00:37:31,851 --> 00:37:35,709
...I was dining one evening at the Savoy
with a rather select group of people...

503
00:37:35,917 --> 00:37:40,610
...and sitting next to me was
a very beautiful lady, much like yourself.

504
00:37:41,235 --> 00:37:45,198
-Now you're pulling my leg.
-Now, just listen, dear.

505
00:37:45,406 --> 00:37:49,577
Well, we were dining and the bombs were
falling, and we were all talking about Hitler...

506
00:37:49,785 --> 00:37:54,999
...and comparing him with Napoleon,
and we were all being really brilliant.

507
00:37:55,103 --> 00:37:58,961
And then, suddenly,
this beautiful lady...

508
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:03,028
...she spoke up and said that was the thing
she didn't mind about Hitler...

509
00:38:03,132 --> 00:38:06,052
...was the way he was treating
the Jews.

510
00:38:07,095 --> 00:38:09,701
Well, we all started arguing with her,
of course.

511
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:14,811
Though, mind you, no one at the table
was Jewish. But she persisted.

512
00:38:15,228 --> 00:38:17,209
Are you listening, honey?

513
00:38:17,626 --> 00:38:19,816
Mustn't interrupt Daddy.

514
00:38:20,024 --> 00:38:23,778
That's right.
You're way too beautiful for that.

515
00:38:23,778 --> 00:38:26,906
Anyway, she went on to say that
that's how she felt about it...

516
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:31,494
...that if she had her way, she would kill
them all, burn them in ovens, like Hitler.

517
00:38:31,703 --> 00:38:34,414
Well, we all sat there in silence.

518
00:38:34,622 --> 00:38:38,376
Then finally, I leaned over to her and I said,
"Madam, I have dined...

519
00:38:38,584 --> 00:38:41,713
...with some of the ugliest goddamn bitches
in my time.

520
00:38:42,338 --> 00:38:47,239
And I have dined with some of the
goddamndest ugly bitches in this world.

521
00:38:47,343 --> 00:38:51,097
But you, my dear,
are the ugliest bitch of them all."

522
00:38:53,287 --> 00:38:57,458
Well, anyway, she got up to leave and she
tripped over a chair and fell on the floor.

523
00:38:57,666 --> 00:39:01,733
And we all just sat there.
No one raised a hand to help her.

524
00:39:01,941 --> 00:39:05,904
And finally when she picked herself up,
I said to her one more time:

525
00:39:06,112 --> 00:39:10,909
"You, my dear, are the ugliest goddamn
bitch I have ever dined with."

526
00:39:12,577 --> 00:39:14,245
Well, you know what happened?

527
00:39:14,454 --> 00:39:17,582
The very next day, she reported me
to the American Embassy.

528
00:39:17,791 --> 00:39:21,649
And they brought me in for reprimand.
And then when they investigated it...

529
00:39:21,753 --> 00:39:25,819
...they found out that she was
a German agent. And they locked her up.

530
00:39:26,862 --> 00:39:28,948
Isn't that amazing?

531
00:39:29,678 --> 00:39:31,971
Why did you tell me that story?

532
00:39:33,848 --> 00:39:35,621
I don't know.

533
00:39:35,725 --> 00:39:38,645
It wasn't because I thought you
were a German agent, honey.

534
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:42,190
But I was tempted tonight
to say the very same thing to you.

535
00:39:42,294 --> 00:39:45,840
I didn't want you to think
I had never said it before.

536
00:39:46,048 --> 00:39:50,636
You, madam, are the--
Well, you know the rest.

537
00:39:53,556 --> 00:39:55,850
-Care for some champagne, honey?
-No, thank you.

538
00:39:56,058 --> 00:39:57,309
Pete?

539
00:39:57,622 --> 00:40:00,959
Well, it's getting late.
I think I'd better go back to my room.

540
00:40:01,168 --> 00:40:03,044
-Pete and I will accompany you.
-There's no need!

541
00:40:03,357 --> 00:40:05,547
No bother at all.

542
00:40:06,173 --> 00:40:08,362
Good night, Margaret.

543
00:40:11,386 --> 00:40:13,367
Sorry, John.

544
00:40:13,993 --> 00:40:15,974
I know you wanted to get laid.

545
00:40:16,808 --> 00:40:18,998
That's all right, kid.

546
00:40:19,728 --> 00:40:22,439
You can't help it if you're a kike.

547
00:40:29,217 --> 00:40:33,492
He says, "Never mind the car keys.
Have you seen the car?"

548
00:40:39,331 --> 00:40:42,250
-You clumsy oaf!
-Dimwit!

549
00:40:42,459 --> 00:40:45,587
-Now look what you've done.
-I'm sorry, boss. I'm sorry.

550
00:40:46,109 --> 00:40:47,673
Come here.

551
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:50,175
John, where you going?

552
00:40:51,009 --> 00:40:53,095
Pick up that glass, boy.

553
00:40:54,137 --> 00:40:56,327
Damn it, pick it up!

554
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:01,436
John.
What are you up to?

555
00:41:01,645 --> 00:41:04,982
I just want to go talk
to Harry for a moment.

556
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,195
What happened here, Harry?

557
00:41:10,404 --> 00:41:13,845
Well, the little black bastard spilled a drink
all over this gentleman.

558
00:41:13,949 --> 00:41:18,224
-On purpose?
-Who knows? Black bastards.

559
00:41:20,935 --> 00:41:25,940
Harry, I think you're a yellow, rotten,
sadistic son of a bitch.

560
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:31,675
Now, Mr. Wilson...

561
00:41:31,675 --> 00:41:34,178
...I don't have to take that kind
of talk from anyone.

562
00:41:35,012 --> 00:41:36,680
That's right. You don't.

563
00:41:36,889 --> 00:41:40,955
How about going outside
and trying to kick me around?

564
00:41:41,268 --> 00:41:42,832
You're drunk, Mr. Wilson.

565
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:46,482
I am, but that doesn't change
the fact that you're yellow, Harry.

566
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:48,046
Bright yellow.

567
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:52,112
I'm not supposed to fight
with the guests, Mr. Wilson.

568
00:41:52,217 --> 00:41:57,326
I'm not a guest tonight, you yellow bastard.
I happen to be an intruder.

569
00:41:58,786 --> 00:42:00,558
Let's go.

570
00:42:08,379 --> 00:42:10,673
What are you doing?
This doesn't make any sense.

571
00:42:10,673 --> 00:42:14,426
If Mrs. MacGregor had been a man,
wouldn't you have knocked him on his ass?

572
00:42:14,531 --> 00:42:17,242
Yes, I would have.
But this is different.

573
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,057
We fought the preliminary
for the kikes.

574
00:42:20,266 --> 00:42:23,498
Now we're gonna fight
the main event for the niggers.

575
00:42:53,528 --> 00:42:55,197
Go, Harry!

576
00:42:59,889 --> 00:43:01,557
Come on!

577
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:06,562
-Think the other hand knows how?
-Go, Harry. You got him now.

578
00:43:06,771 --> 00:43:08,335
You got him on the run.

579
00:43:26,374 --> 00:43:27,834
Finish him!

580
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:36,801
Finish him off, why don't you?

581
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:39,303
Come on!

582
00:43:39,512 --> 00:43:42,119
Yellow bastard.

583
00:43:43,683 --> 00:43:47,541
Steady on, old man.
Fair's fair, eh?

584
00:43:54,944 --> 00:43:57,551
Please don't get up, Mr. Wilson.

585
00:44:00,992 --> 00:44:03,390
Aren't you gonna stop it?

586
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:15,590
Come on.

587
00:44:17,258 --> 00:44:19,656
Where is he?
I'll kill the bastard.

588
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:21,533
He's called it quits, John.

589
00:44:21,638 --> 00:44:24,557
-I told you he was yellow.
-I think you had better get a doctor.

590
00:44:24,766 --> 00:44:27,268
He's hurt that bad?

591
00:44:28,728 --> 00:44:30,709
And he almost killed you.

592
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:36,966
You're full of crap. I was about ready
to finish him off when you grabbed me.

593
00:44:40,615 --> 00:44:44,265
All right. You're back
in your room now, John.

594
00:44:44,369 --> 00:44:47,288
-I am.
-Yeah, it's all over.

595
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:49,582
How about that?

596
00:44:52,711 --> 00:44:55,839
I feel pretty good, really.

597
00:44:56,881 --> 00:44:59,384
It's like I always tell you, kid.

598
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:03,242
You gotta fight when you think
it's the right thing to do.

599
00:45:04,806 --> 00:45:08,143
Otherwise, you feel like
your gut's full of pus.

600
00:45:08,768 --> 00:45:14,608
Even if you get the hell beat out of you.
If you fight, you feel okay about it.

601
00:45:19,613 --> 00:45:23,262
"Dear Pete: Of all the wild animals in Africa,
John Wilson is the wildest.

602
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:25,452
I beg you to do everything you can" ....

603
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:28,788
Everything you can
to bring him to his senses.

604
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:33,585
Next time he picks a fight with an employee
of the hotel or the company...

605
00:45:33,794 --> 00:45:36,817
...you have my permission
to hit him from behind.

606
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:41,093
{y:i}Will arrive in Africa in 10 days.
{y:i}Paul.

607
00:45:41,301 --> 00:45:44,221
Good morning!
How are we?

608
00:45:45,055 --> 00:45:46,098
Good morning.

609
00:45:46,306 --> 00:45:50,477
-Can I do something for you?
-No. No, you can't, Ralph.

610
00:45:50,477 --> 00:45:52,979
But you can do something
for yourself.

611
00:45:53,605 --> 00:45:55,065
What's that?

612
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:57,776
Stick to your own job
and stop spying on Wilson.

613
00:45:57,984 --> 00:46:01,008
Spying?
What the hell do you mean?

614
00:46:01,113 --> 00:46:03,407
You told Landers Wilson provoked a fight,
didn't you?

615
00:46:03,615 --> 00:46:08,516
And that's bullshit. Someone should have
hit that bastard a long time ago, Ralph.

616
00:46:10,706 --> 00:46:13,104
You do realize you're backing
the wrong horse, don't you?

617
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:16,545
Wilson is the boss, and there's not
a damn thing you can do about it.

618
00:46:16,753 --> 00:46:20,716
-Phone, Mr. Lockhart. London calling.
-Yes, all right.

619
00:46:20,924 --> 00:46:23,218
Just remember what I said.

620
00:46:25,304 --> 00:46:27,181
Have a pleasant day.

621
00:46:31,977 --> 00:46:34,688
I would have had him in no time
if you hadn't stopped me.

622
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:38,442
No, I agree, John.
He only knocked you down 15 times or so.

623
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:42,196
I was just getting onto his style.
Another 10 minutes, I would've killed him.

624
00:46:42,404 --> 00:46:46,158
-In any case, it was worth doing.
-It certainly was.

625
00:46:47,618 --> 00:46:50,329
I've arranged for you to fly
to a hunting camp on Lake Albert.

626
00:46:50,537 --> 00:46:53,248
You can pick up the Ruki River
there and scout it by boat.

627
00:46:53,457 --> 00:46:55,542
The camp's owned
by a man named Zibelinsky.

628
00:46:55,751 --> 00:46:59,817
-He's laid on a safari, if you have time.
-We'll have time.

629
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:03,050
Mr. Wilson, Mr. Landers is
on the phone from London.

630
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:05,865
Well, you tell him
you just missed me.

631
00:47:06,595 --> 00:47:10,766
-John, it might be important.
-You tell him that I've gone on a recce.

632
00:47:19,316 --> 00:47:22,861
Goodbye, you worthless son of a bitch.

633
00:47:27,658 --> 00:47:31,412
Goodbye, you pearl
of Central East Africa.

634
00:47:34,227 --> 00:47:36,938
Goodbye, you lake flies.

635
00:47:37,147 --> 00:47:40,900
Goodbye, you flat-chested,
bucktoothed women.

636
00:47:42,882 --> 00:47:45,176
Goodbye forever.

637
00:47:49,764 --> 00:47:52,266
Hello, anybody home?

638
00:47:57,063 --> 00:48:00,191
Hello.
You chaps looking for me?

639
00:48:03,215 --> 00:48:06,238
The name's Hodkins.
Your new airplane driver.

640
00:48:06,968 --> 00:48:09,992
-This is Mr. Wilson, Pete Verrill.
-Call me Hod.

641
00:48:10,201 --> 00:48:14,789
If you don't mind, we better get going.
Don't want to start out late for the Congo.

642
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:20,836
Hod, I understand you have never
flown in the Congo before.

643
00:48:21,045 --> 00:48:23,339
I should be able to find the way.
But if I can't, well...

644
00:48:23,547 --> 00:48:26,884
...we'll just set down in one
of those big trees and spend the night.

645
00:48:26,884 --> 00:48:30,012
Only problem with that is, it's a little
difficult getting it up the next morning.

646
00:48:30,117 --> 00:48:35,017
Well, as a famous pilot once said, "It's all
worth it. Including the final crash."

647
00:48:35,226 --> 00:48:38,563
Well, that's Pete's philosophy too,
isn't it?

648
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:41,065
I'll get the luggage.

649
00:48:48,468 --> 00:48:50,032
So, this is....

650
00:48:50,241 --> 00:48:52,848
This is really your first time
over the Congo, Hod?

651
00:48:53,056 --> 00:48:55,350
Yeah, quite. Yeah.

652
00:48:58,374 --> 00:49:00,877
Abyssinia!

653
00:49:37,163 --> 00:49:39,874
It's just like the airlines, eh?

654
00:50:32,218 --> 00:50:34,721
-Yes.
-I'll help you.

655
00:50:36,702 --> 00:50:38,996
-It's the spot.
-That's it.

656
00:50:45,357 --> 00:50:47,442
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

657
00:50:48,276 --> 00:50:50,466
You see this hill here?

658
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:53,073
The hill. Right here!
The hill!

659
00:50:54,324 --> 00:50:56,618
Christ! Where's the stick?

660
00:50:56,827 --> 00:50:58,391
Shit!

661
00:51:16,742 --> 00:51:20,183
Jesus.
Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

662
00:51:20,496 --> 00:51:22,790
Thanks awfully, old boy.

663
00:51:23,207 --> 00:51:24,667
Pete.

664
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:28,212
I'm gonna take myself a nap.

665
00:51:28,421 --> 00:51:31,862
Please don't wake me up unless
you're sure we're going to crash, because...

666
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:34,781
...l wouldn't want
to miss something like that.

667
00:51:37,284 --> 00:51:39,265
No.

668
00:52:28,064 --> 00:52:31,609
Hey, all that fancy flying back there
didn't bother you at all, did it?

669
00:52:31,714 --> 00:52:33,903
No, not at all.

670
00:52:34,112 --> 00:52:37,240
It was your friend's idea.
I think he thought it was a good joke.

671
00:52:37,449 --> 00:52:39,117
A joke?

672
00:52:39,638 --> 00:52:41,515
What if the engines
would've stalled out?

673
00:52:41,619 --> 00:52:47,354
Well, I was a bit worried, but the old boy
seemed awfully keen on his rib.

674
00:52:47,563 --> 00:52:49,753
The old boy's a pain in the ass.

675
00:52:49,961 --> 00:52:53,298
A bloody valet with wings.
That's what a pilot is out here.

676
00:52:53,506 --> 00:52:55,070
Ranks right up there
with writers.

677
00:52:55,279 --> 00:52:57,781
-That's what you do, is it?
-Yeah, that's what I do.

678
00:52:57,781 --> 00:52:59,450
I was wondering what your part was.

679
00:52:59,658 --> 00:53:02,265
I've got some very bloody funny stories
I should tell you.

680
00:53:02,474 --> 00:53:08,000
A particularly good one was
when the squadron dog bit me in Khartoum.

681
00:53:08,521 --> 00:53:11,232
-Was his name Horace?
-Horace? No, why?

682
00:53:11,441 --> 00:53:13,109
Forget it.

683
00:53:50,021 --> 00:53:52,733
-You must be Mr. Wilson.
-That's right. Mr. Zibelinsky.

684
00:53:52,941 --> 00:53:56,903
-Delighted.
-This is Pete Verrill and Hodkins, our pilot.

685
00:53:57,008 --> 00:54:00,866
-Quite a place you have here, Mr. Zibelinsky.
-Thank you.

686
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:05,662
Well, by George, here they are.
The hunters from Hollywood.

687
00:54:07,226 --> 00:54:11,814
-How did you get here?
-Came with a pilot who knew the way.

688
00:54:12,127 --> 00:54:14,734
Right this way, Mr. Wilson.

689
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:32,147
I think I found a steamboat
for you, Mr. Wilson.

690
00:54:32,356 --> 00:54:35,380
You have?
When can I take a look at it?

691
00:54:35,797 --> 00:54:37,674
Day after tomorrow.

692
00:54:37,882 --> 00:54:40,802
I'm having her put in dry dock
to check her bottom.

693
00:54:40,906 --> 00:54:43,930
The Belgians want a bloody great
bond posted before we can use it...

694
00:54:44,034 --> 00:54:46,120
...but we'll talk them
out of that one.

695
00:54:46,745 --> 00:54:48,205
Where's Harrison this evening?

696
00:54:48,309 --> 00:54:51,437
Down on the other location,
near Ponthierville.

697
00:54:52,272 --> 00:54:55,400
Mr. Landers is still trying
to get in touch with you.

698
00:54:55,712 --> 00:54:57,485
I'm sure.

699
00:54:57,485 --> 00:55:01,030
We're going hunting in the morning.
Would you like to go with us, Ralph?

700
00:55:01,239 --> 00:55:05,723
Customs bloke's coming over
from Tatsumu to log all my stuff in.

701
00:55:15,003 --> 00:55:16,671
I say...

702
00:55:17,088 --> 00:55:20,112
...is he always like this just
before a production starts?

703
00:55:20,633 --> 00:55:22,197
Like what, Ralph?

704
00:55:23,762 --> 00:55:26,473
He acts as if he couldn't care less.

705
00:55:26,681 --> 00:55:28,349
He'll be fine, Ralph...

706
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:30,956
...once he's killed an elephant.

707
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:34,710
Good evening, gentlemen.

708
00:55:35,127 --> 00:55:38,672
John, this is my wife, Dorshka.

709
00:55:38,777 --> 00:55:41,488
-What a pleasure indeed, dear.
-Hello.

710
00:55:42,322 --> 00:55:45,346
You know Ralph Lockhart?

711
00:55:46,284 --> 00:55:50,142
-Yes, we met this afternoon.
-And this is Peter Verrill.

712
00:55:50,351 --> 00:55:51,915
-Hello.
-Hello. Welcome.

713
00:55:52,332 --> 00:55:56,294
-So you are a big-game enthusiast also?
-Well, more or less.

714
00:55:56,398 --> 00:56:01,299
Well, it's a pleasure to have you here.
It's a pleasure to have you all here.

715
00:56:01,508 --> 00:56:04,323
I hope you found
your quarters comfortable.

716
00:56:04,532 --> 00:56:07,138
This is simply paradise.

717
00:56:07,347 --> 00:56:09,224
Absolute paradise here.

718
00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:14,229
In fact, I'm seriously thinking
of staying here forever.

719
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:22,571
Come on. Heave it!

720
00:56:26,846 --> 00:56:31,121
-Well, what do you think of her?
-She's beautiful. Perfect.

721
00:56:31,225 --> 00:56:33,206
Well, not quite.

722
00:56:33,415 --> 00:56:38,003
She's very old, you see? And according
to the skipper, not all that seaworthy.

723
00:56:39,046 --> 00:56:40,505
-Oh, she will be.
-Well, yes.

724
00:56:40,714 --> 00:56:43,633
For everything except
the white-water sequence.

725
00:56:44,363 --> 00:56:46,970
The skipper says
it would be far too dangerous.

726
00:56:47,074 --> 00:56:50,724
She'd fall apart if you attempted
to run the rapids with her.

727
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:55,312
Actually, I called Mr. Landers
and told him about it.

728
00:56:55,416 --> 00:56:59,483
He suggested....
Well, I should say, he insisted...

729
00:56:59,691 --> 00:57:01,985
...that you cut the sequence
out of the film.

730
00:57:02,194 --> 00:57:04,488
-He did?
-Right.

731
00:57:04,696 --> 00:57:06,365
Wrong.

732
00:57:07,512 --> 00:57:10,327
No, she looks sound to me.

733
00:57:11,474 --> 00:57:14,915
Of course, there's only one way
to find out, isn't there, Ralph?

734
00:57:56,936 --> 00:57:58,396
Do stop!

735
00:57:59,647 --> 00:58:01,629
Stop, please! Stop!

736
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:37,081
Shit.

737
00:58:37,915 --> 00:58:41,877
Are you convinced, Ralph?
Or would you like to continue on?

738
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:47,404
Oh, no!

739
00:58:48,655 --> 00:58:50,532
I'm convinced.

740
00:58:53,243 --> 00:58:55,537
So am I.

741
00:59:12,325 --> 00:59:15,244
Well, has anyone heard
from our chief hunter yet?

742
00:59:15,453 --> 00:59:18,060
He should be here soon.
I sent one of the boys over to fetch him.

743
00:59:18,268 --> 00:59:20,145
Good.

744
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:27,235
-Our chief hunter.
-For God's sake, let's have him in.

745
00:59:30,572 --> 00:59:33,805
Explain to him what we want.
We want to go after some game.

746
00:59:33,909 --> 00:59:36,933
Buffalo, preferably an elephant.

747
01:00:14,470 --> 01:00:16,973
This man is wonderful.
What's his name?

748
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:18,954
Kivu.

749
01:00:19,267 --> 01:00:22,395
He's called Kivu because he went
on a trip there once.

750
01:00:41,372 --> 01:00:45,230
I must say, Kivu is amazing.
He found elephant tracks that big.

751
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:51,695
A whole herd. Only darkness prevented us
from going on. Tell him to sit down.

752
01:00:56,075 --> 01:00:58,056
He says he prefers to stand.

753
01:00:58,264 --> 01:01:01,705
Oh! Good evening, gentlemen.

754
01:01:02,644 --> 01:01:07,127
So did the Hollywood hunters
have any luck today?

755
01:01:07,336 --> 01:01:09,109
Tell Kivu to get a good night's rest.

756
01:01:09,213 --> 01:01:13,697
We'll be leaving at 5:00 in the morning.
We'll get our elephant then.

757
01:01:25,062 --> 01:01:31,527
I talked to Mr. Landers in London.
He's quite hysterical.

758
01:01:31,944 --> 01:01:34,238
He wants to talk to you tomorrow.

759
01:01:34,447 --> 01:01:40,182
I told him that we could drive you down
to the border and use that phone there.

760
01:01:41,016 --> 01:01:45,395
-You did, did you?
-You'll be on safari, I suppose.

761
01:01:45,604 --> 01:01:49,253
You're welcome to come along
with us if you'd like, Ralph.

762
01:01:49,775 --> 01:01:52,694
No Hollywood safaris for me.

763
01:01:59,159 --> 01:02:04,268
That word has crept into the conversation
quite a few times, hasn't it?

764
01:02:04,790 --> 01:02:08,960
-Which word is that, sir?
-Hollywood.

765
01:02:09,065 --> 01:02:14,383
I realize it's the name of a place, but
the way you say it has an added meaning.

766
01:02:14,591 --> 01:02:16,155
Like an insult.

767
01:02:17,198 --> 01:02:20,430
-Well, I didn't mean it like that.
-Don't contradict me, Ralph.

768
01:02:20,639 --> 01:02:22,516
I've heard it all before.

769
01:02:22,724 --> 01:02:24,288
In the Army, in New York...

770
01:02:24,497 --> 01:02:27,938
...in the theater.
Hell, I've heard it everywhere.

771
01:02:28,355 --> 01:02:31,900
People say Hollywood
when they want to insult you.

772
01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:36,280
Well, really Hollywood is just a place
where they make a profit.

773
01:02:36,488 --> 01:02:41,806
It's a factory town like Detroit
or Birmingham or Schaffhausen.

774
01:02:42,119 --> 01:02:46,185
Because the cheap element of the town
has been so overly advertised...

775
01:02:46,290 --> 01:02:50,043
...it becomes an insult to remind
a man he's from there.

776
01:02:50,773 --> 01:02:53,589
They're not talking about the people
who work there...

777
01:02:53,797 --> 01:02:56,091
...and that try to do
something worthwhile.

778
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:59,636
They're talking about the whores
when they mention Hollywood.

779
01:02:59,741 --> 01:03:02,347
You know what that word means,
don't you, Ralph?

780
01:03:04,016 --> 01:03:06,935
-Sure.
-Sure.

781
01:03:08,499 --> 01:03:12,358
Whores have to sell the one thing that
shouldn't be for sale in the world.

782
01:03:12,566 --> 01:03:14,026
And that's love.

783
01:03:14,234 --> 01:03:18,718
Of course, there are other kinds of whores
than the floozies you frequent, Ralph.

784
01:03:18,927 --> 01:03:24,244
There are whores who sell words
and ideas and melodies.

785
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:29,667
I know what I'm talking about because
I've done a little hustling in my time.

786
01:03:29,771 --> 01:03:33,525
A hell of a lot more
than I'd like to admit to.

787
01:03:33,942 --> 01:03:38,634
And what I sold when I was whoring
I'll never get back.

788
01:03:40,511 --> 01:03:45,829
What I'm trying to say, it's the whores
who put Hollywood up as a big target.

789
01:03:47,706 --> 01:03:49,165
Sure.

790
01:04:00,635 --> 01:04:04,076
Hell, John, I didn't realize you
were such a hometown boy.

791
01:04:04,702 --> 01:04:09,707
-Well, I am, kid. I am when I'm in Africa.
-Yeah.

792
01:04:10,228 --> 01:04:13,878
No, I'm serious. It took Africa
to bring all this out in me.

793
01:04:14,086 --> 01:04:18,049
Africa and the smell
of my first wild elephant.

794
01:04:21,907 --> 01:04:24,618
It's a shame Kivu couldn't have heard
you say that, John.

795
01:04:25,243 --> 01:04:29,206
Oh, Kivu knows. Kivu knows
without being told.

796
01:04:29,310 --> 01:04:32,334
John, why don't you ask Kivu to go
back to Hollywood with you?

797
01:04:32,855 --> 01:04:37,130
Not a bad idea, kid. He could be
mighty useful around there.

798
01:04:37,339 --> 01:04:38,903
Yeah.

799
01:04:46,723 --> 01:04:49,330
Where are we going this morning, John?

800
01:04:49,539 --> 01:04:54,439
A place Kivu knows. And he says a lot
of elephant go there this time of year.

801
01:04:54,648 --> 01:04:58,506
I was wondering. How do
you two communicate?

802
01:04:58,610 --> 01:05:03,719
Oh, we get on. I asked him this morning
about going back to the States with me.

803
01:05:03,928 --> 01:05:07,473
Zib here actually
acted as my interpreter.

804
01:05:07,682 --> 01:05:10,914
-What did he say?
-Said he didn't know.

805
01:05:11,123 --> 01:05:16,128
Said he'd have to think about it.
That it was a very big decision.

806
01:05:30,204 --> 01:05:32,290
He says we're getting close.

807
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:48,139
He says they're in there, but he thinks
it best if only two shooters go.

808
01:05:49,286 --> 01:05:52,831
-Pete, are you ready?
-No, you and Zib are plenty.

809
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:55,438
-You're not coming?
-No, I'll wait here.

810
01:05:55,542 --> 01:05:59,088
Now, look, kid. I've never
given you much advice.

811
01:05:59,296 --> 01:06:02,946
I've never forced you to do anything.
But this time it's different.

812
01:06:02,946 --> 01:06:05,344
I think you should come.
I urge you as a friend.

813
01:06:05,448 --> 01:06:07,846
No, you just go on in there,
John. I'll wait here.

814
01:06:08,472 --> 01:06:11,600
If you don't come, you'll regret this
as long as you can remember.

815
01:06:11,704 --> 01:06:14,624
-I don't want to shoot an elephant.
-That's besides the point.

816
01:06:14,833 --> 01:06:18,378
If you don't come, it's because
you're scared. And you know it.

817
01:06:23,383 --> 01:06:26,824
All right, well, I guess I'll just have
to live with that.

818
01:07:27,718 --> 01:07:30,951
John. John, hold your fire.

819
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:35,017
John, don't shoot!

820
01:07:38,875 --> 01:07:43,463
It's too dangerous. Hold your fire.
Come back slowly. Come on.

821
01:07:43,463 --> 01:07:46,383
This is him. This is the one
I'm looking for.

822
01:07:46,904 --> 01:07:50,971
It's not safe. There are too many cows
around. Come back slowly. Come on.

823
01:07:56,289 --> 01:07:58,791
Just come. Do as I tell you. Come on.

824
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:24,338
I've never seen one before,
outside the circus or the zoo.

825
01:08:26,110 --> 01:08:30,803
They're so majestic. So indestructible.
They're part of the earth.

826
01:08:34,765 --> 01:08:39,874
They make us feel like perverse little
creatures from another planet.

827
01:08:43,107 --> 01:08:45,505
Without any dignity.

828
01:08:48,529 --> 01:08:50,927
Makes one believe in God.

829
01:08:52,804 --> 01:08:55,515
In the miracle of creation.

830
01:08:57,496 --> 01:08:59,790
Fantastic.

831
01:09:00,103 --> 01:09:03,648
They're part of a world
that no longer exists, Hod.

832
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:11,886
Feeling of unconquerable time.

833
01:09:13,867 --> 01:09:19,289
You certainly have a way with words,
Pete. No wonder you're a writer.

834
01:09:39,413 --> 01:09:43,376
So, what happened, John?
Weren't you able to get close enough?

835
01:09:46,608 --> 01:09:49,319
We got close enough,
but I wouldn't let him shoot.

836
01:09:49,528 --> 01:09:52,134
Too many cows around the big fellow.
They'd have charged.

837
01:09:52,343 --> 01:09:55,471
That was the biggest tusker
in all of Africa.

838
01:09:58,703 --> 01:10:01,727
It would have been a risk
well worth taking.

839
01:11:08,461 --> 01:11:12,111
-You all right?
-I'm all right.

840
01:11:13,049 --> 01:11:14,822
John.

841
01:11:15,030 --> 01:11:18,575
Come on, let's face it.
This country's too tough for us.

842
01:11:18,993 --> 01:11:23,893
We're just characters from Vine Street.
We're not heroes out of one of your films.

843
01:11:25,979 --> 01:11:27,856
Come on.

844
01:11:28,273 --> 01:11:29,628
Get up.

845
01:11:29,837 --> 01:11:35,884
You know, kid, we're gonna end up
together. When we're old, that is.

846
01:11:36,927 --> 01:11:42,662
Probably live in a cabin up in the Sierras
and pan for gold. Have a couple mules.

847
01:11:44,748 --> 01:11:48,293
Sit around the campfire at night.
Tell lies to each other.

848
01:11:48,501 --> 01:11:52,047
-Yeah.
-About all the things we've done.

849
01:11:52,255 --> 01:11:58,407
The wars we fought. Books you've
written, movies I've made.

850
01:11:59,241 --> 01:12:01,744
You know, I don't doubt that, John.

851
01:12:05,498 --> 01:12:09,043
You'll need two, possibly three cameras
on the fire sequence, John.

852
01:12:09,147 --> 01:12:13,109
If you could just initial these plans,
I can go ahead and start construction.

853
01:12:13,214 --> 01:12:15,403
It was a risk to all of us.

854
01:12:15,612 --> 01:12:19,991
A herd of cows can go rogue very quickly
if they have their young with them.

855
01:12:21,034 --> 01:12:24,684
There have been rogue herds created in
Kenya and Tanganyika in just such a way.

856
01:12:24,892 --> 01:12:27,812
And then they have to go out and
shoot every bloody one of them.

857
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:31,774
All right. All right. Forget it.
We'll try again tomorrow.

858
01:12:31,983 --> 01:12:37,092
Tomorrow morning. Tomorrow afternoon,
we leave. I have another safari.

859
01:12:38,030 --> 01:12:40,741
You have to get started
on the film, John.

860
01:12:42,097 --> 01:12:45,016
You can leave if you want. I'm staying.

861
01:12:45,121 --> 01:12:48,249
The company arrives in Entebbe
the day after tomorrow.

862
01:12:48,353 --> 01:12:49,604
I'm staying.

863
01:12:49,813 --> 01:12:53,567
-Jesus Christ! Will you be reasonable?
-I am being reasonable.

864
01:12:53,671 --> 01:12:58,363
I don't give a goddamn if the company gets
here tomorrow or got here three days ago.

865
01:12:58,467 --> 01:13:00,657
I'm staying till I get my elephant.

866
01:13:00,970 --> 01:13:03,160
You need someone with you.
You can't hunt alone.

867
01:13:03,368 --> 01:13:06,913
-Kivu will go with me.
-What about that fellow at the fishery?

868
01:13:07,122 --> 01:13:11,814
The one who used to be game warden
down on the Zambezi. Ogilvy?

869
01:13:12,023 --> 01:13:17,132
Yes. Yes, that's the man. Yes, they say
he killed over 500 elephants in his day.

870
01:13:17,341 --> 01:13:21,303
-Well, let's get him up here.
-John, how long do you plan on staying?

871
01:13:22,137 --> 01:13:25,995
Well, that depends upon the elephants.
And on the guides.

872
01:13:26,204 --> 01:13:32,356
If Ogilvy turns out to be another old lady
like the rest of you, it may take months.

873
01:13:32,564 --> 01:13:36,944
But if he's half the man Kivu is,
it may take no time at all.

874
01:13:48,935 --> 01:13:52,480
What's the matter, kid?
Go ahead and spit it out.

875
01:13:52,793 --> 01:13:56,964
You're sitting around stewing like
a dame who's just been kicked out of bed.

876
01:13:59,049 --> 01:14:01,343
You're either crazy...

877
01:14:01,969 --> 01:14:08,434
...or the most egocentric, irresponsible
son of a bitch that I've ever met.

878
01:14:09,893 --> 01:14:13,856
You're about to blow this whole picture
out of your nose, John.

879
01:14:15,524 --> 01:14:17,401
And for what?

880
01:14:18,548 --> 01:14:20,529
To commit a crime.

881
01:14:21,572 --> 01:14:24,596
To kill one of the rarest,
most noble creatures...

882
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:28,141
...that roams the face
of this crummy earth.

883
01:14:29,496 --> 01:14:35,231
And in order for you to commit this crime,
you're willing to forget about all of us...

884
01:14:35,336 --> 01:14:38,464
...and let this whole goddamn
thing go down the drain.

885
01:14:43,469 --> 01:14:45,450
You're wrong, kid.

886
01:14:46,076 --> 01:14:51,394
It's not a crime to kill an elephant.
It's bigger than all that.

887
01:14:52,228 --> 01:14:55,147
It's a sin to kill an elephant.

888
01:14:56,086 --> 01:14:59,214
Do you understand? It's a sin.

889
01:14:59,422 --> 01:15:03,593
It's the only sin that you can buy
a license and go out and commit.

890
01:15:03,802 --> 01:15:07,451
That's why I want to do it before
I do anything else in this world.

891
01:15:07,451 --> 01:15:12,248
Do you understand me?
Of course you don't.

892
01:15:12,456 --> 01:15:15,376
How could you?
I don't understand myself.

893
01:15:20,277 --> 01:15:24,552
Well, if you don't need me, then I'll
take the plane to London tomorrow.

894
01:15:25,177 --> 01:15:31,434
You do that. I've never been one to interfere
with anything a friend of mine wants to do.

895
01:16:14,706 --> 01:16:17,313
-How do you do? It's nice to meet you.
-Welcome. My wife.

896
01:16:17,417 --> 01:16:19,503
-Hello. How do you do?
-Good morning, welcome.

897
01:16:19,711 --> 01:16:22,214
-Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.
-How do you do?

898
01:16:22,423 --> 01:16:24,508
-Well, hello.
-Welcome. Welcome.

899
01:16:24,716 --> 01:16:27,323
Miss Gibson. Right here.

900
01:16:32,745 --> 01:16:34,309
Pete!

901
01:16:34,727 --> 01:16:38,376
Pete! Where's John? Why isn't he here?

902
01:16:38,585 --> 01:16:41,191
I'm going back to London
on the next flight, Paul.

903
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:43,902
What happened? Where's John?
Where's the script?

904
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:47,552
-I sent you the script. Didn't you get it?
-I got half of it.

905
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:50,680
-There's only one copy?
-No. John has the original.

906
01:16:50,889 --> 01:16:53,495
If he hasn't lost it,
which he probably has.

907
01:16:53,704 --> 01:16:54,851
-How are you, Pete?
-Hi.

908
01:16:55,059 --> 01:16:59,335
-Where's the ogre?
-He's out scouting locations.

909
01:16:59,856 --> 01:17:02,150
I hope you boys have
improved the script.

910
01:17:02,358 --> 01:17:05,070
What Kay means is,
is her part gonna get bigger?

911
01:17:05,174 --> 01:17:08,510
Not at all. I don't mind if you do
the talking and I don't say a word.

912
01:17:08,719 --> 01:17:11,743
As long as I get to play
a real human being.

913
01:17:12,369 --> 01:17:15,184
Beautiful, Kay. Come with me.
Come this way. To the side.

914
01:17:15,288 --> 01:17:18,103
Mr. Duncan! Can we have one of you
with your new bride?

915
01:17:18,208 --> 01:17:21,232
How do you want it, boys?
Passionate or domestic?

916
01:17:21,962 --> 01:17:24,047
Can we have a kiss?

917
01:17:25,298 --> 01:17:26,967
Thank you very much.

918
01:17:44,484 --> 01:17:50,011
Peter, think. Think what will happen
to the morale of the company if you go back.

919
01:17:50,219 --> 01:17:54,807
They'll think something terrible is wrong.
I can't start a picture that way.

920
01:17:55,016 --> 01:18:01,376
Paul, don't you understand? Something
terrible is wrong! The man has the fever.

921
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:06,590
It's just like any passion.
It's irresponsible and it's destructive!

922
01:18:06,798 --> 01:18:12,325
I understand how you feel, but we've got
a picture to make. You've got to stay.

923
01:18:12,950 --> 01:18:17,747
You've got to help me get him back. If he's
not back in three days, we'll all be ruined.

924
01:18:19,832 --> 01:18:22,439
Apologize to him.

925
01:18:24,524 --> 01:18:28,070
Go on, apologize to him.

926
01:18:33,075 --> 01:18:37,246
No. I won't apologize to him, Paul,
but I'll tell you what I will do.

927
01:18:37,454 --> 01:18:41,625
I'll get that script from him. Because
you hired me to write a script.

928
01:18:41,729 --> 01:18:43,710
And it's the best writing I've ever done.

929
01:18:43,919 --> 01:18:48,194
And I'll be goddamned
if I'll let that bastard destroy it!

930
01:19:16,869 --> 01:19:20,101
-Hello, chaps.
-Where's John?

931
01:19:20,205 --> 01:19:23,334
-Well, believe it or not, he's gone.
-Gone where?

932
01:19:23,542 --> 01:19:28,651
He's visiting Kivu's village up
in Semuliki. It's the truth.

933
01:19:28,756 --> 01:19:32,509
Ogilvy and Kivu convinced him
that's the best place to find a big tusker.

934
01:19:32,614 --> 01:19:34,803
-So off they went.
-Shit.

935
01:19:35,012 --> 01:19:37,932
-And how far is that from here?
-About six miles.

936
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:40,643
Most of it through swamp.

937
01:19:40,851 --> 01:19:43,875
-There's been a change in plans.
-What's that?

938
01:19:44,188 --> 01:19:47,629
The boss has decided to start
shooting the film there.

939
01:19:47,837 --> 01:19:52,947
Made up his mind yesterday when we
finally cleared the trucks through customs.

940
01:19:53,781 --> 01:19:57,743
He seems to think Kivu's village
is much more authentic.

941
01:19:57,952 --> 01:20:01,393
The company can stay
at the hunting camp.

942
01:20:07,753 --> 01:20:09,943
Have a pleasant day.

943
01:20:15,782 --> 01:20:19,119
There it is, there.
That must be the village there.

944
01:20:39,243 --> 01:20:41,224
I don't believe it.

945
01:20:42,371 --> 01:20:44,457
I just don't believe it.

946
01:20:50,504 --> 01:20:54,467
What about the village we built
at Masindi? It cost a fortune.

947
01:20:54,467 --> 01:20:57,074
Lockhart says John plans to use
that for the big fire.

948
01:20:57,178 --> 01:20:59,889
He'll move back there once
he's finished in the Congo.

949
01:21:00,097 --> 01:21:04,060
I'm not going to let him do it! I'm not
going to send people to a place like that.

950
01:21:04,268 --> 01:21:06,562
I'll call off the picture first!

951
01:21:06,771 --> 01:21:08,856
You've already invested
over 1 00,000 pounds, Paul.

952
01:21:09,065 --> 01:21:12,610
I'll pay it back if it takes
the rest of my life.

953
01:21:13,548 --> 01:21:16,989
Why don't you just tell everybody
that it'll be rough.

954
01:21:17,094 --> 01:21:20,639
-But it'll make for a distinguished film.
-No, we can't do that.

955
01:21:20,847 --> 01:21:22,620
-Why not?
-Because we can't!

956
01:21:22,829 --> 01:21:26,374
Either we call it off
or we play along with Wilson.

957
01:21:26,478 --> 01:21:30,440
We can be honorable or crooked.
There's no middle road.

958
01:21:31,379 --> 01:21:33,673
Well, I don't agree with you.

959
01:21:33,777 --> 01:21:36,905
I've always found that it's better
just to tell the truth.

960
01:21:39,825 --> 01:21:45,038
If I had always told the truth, Pete,
I would now be a cake of soap.

961
01:22:07,457 --> 01:22:12,462
-Does this look familiar to you, Pete?
-Yes, Paul, we're getting close.

962
01:22:12,670 --> 01:22:15,694
It's awfully primitive.
Where's the hotel?

963
01:22:45,203 --> 01:22:50,521
-Well, here it is. Home away from home.
-Well, I think this is quite lovely.

964
01:22:51,772 --> 01:22:53,753
Holy shit.

965
01:23:16,067 --> 01:23:19,196
Oh, do come in, chaps. Do come in.

966
01:23:19,404 --> 01:23:21,490
I've been looking forward
to seeing you again.

967
01:23:21,698 --> 01:23:26,286
May I present Madam Dorshka
and Mr. Zibelinsky, our hosts.

968
01:23:29,623 --> 01:23:33,585
Well, this is glorious.

969
01:23:40,258 --> 01:23:41,927
This is marvelous.

970
01:23:47,140 --> 01:23:50,060
And this is Count Ogilvy,
my new white hunter.

971
01:23:50,268 --> 01:23:51,937
Hello, John.

972
01:23:54,439 --> 01:23:56,629
-So wonderful to be here.
-Excuse my friend.

973
01:23:56,838 --> 01:23:59,653
-How do you do? Very glad to see you.
-Hello, John.

974
01:23:59,861 --> 01:24:02,155
-Hello, John.
-Pleasure to see you all.

975
01:24:02,155 --> 01:24:03,928
-How you doing?
-Cheers.

976
01:24:06,639 --> 01:24:10,393
Well, have some champagne,
everyone, and let's get with it.

977
01:24:10,497 --> 01:24:11,957
-Cheers, John.
-With the evening.

978
01:24:13,834 --> 01:24:16,753
I trust you all enjoyed
our borscht  la Russe?

979
01:24:16,962 --> 01:24:21,237
-Excellent. Absolutely first class.
-Spiffing.

980
01:24:21,550 --> 01:24:24,991
And now we have
the pice de rsistance.

981
01:24:39,797 --> 01:24:43,447
It's a freshly killed reedbuck
from Semuliki plain.

982
01:24:43,655 --> 01:24:48,869
The female of the species, just to prove
that God does not let man off the hook.

983
01:24:51,476 --> 01:24:58,045
So I told Anatole that he should not let
Paulette ever do that again.

984
01:24:59,505 --> 01:25:03,050
John, can we stop playing games?

985
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:08,889
Playing games, dear fellow?
I don't quite understand.

986
01:25:10,558 --> 01:25:13,060
Well, we have to get started tomorrow.

987
01:25:13,269 --> 01:25:18,065
Red has to go out to the location.
You have to check the costumes.

988
01:25:18,274 --> 01:25:20,568
I'm willing to do anything
you suggest, dear boy.

989
01:25:20,672 --> 01:25:22,862
That is, within reason, of course.

990
01:25:25,573 --> 01:25:30,473
Well, first of all can you drop that phony
English accent? And for God's sakes...

991
01:25:30,578 --> 01:25:34,957
...abandon your role
of the great white hunter...

992
01:25:35,374 --> 01:25:38,607
...and become a movie director again.

993
01:25:44,341 --> 01:25:47,574
Listen, you Balkan rug peddler...

994
01:25:47,782 --> 01:25:51,223
...my role of the great hunter,
as you put it, is my own business.

995
01:25:51,432 --> 01:25:55,707
It has nothing to do with you.
It's a sacred subject.

996
01:25:55,916 --> 01:25:59,252
Much like the sex life of my mother.

997
01:25:59,982 --> 01:26:04,883
It's something you'll refrain from talking
about or even thinking about.

998
01:26:04,987 --> 01:26:09,888
It's way too difficult a subject
for your small little brain to grasp.

999
01:26:10,097 --> 01:26:13,120
It's a passion that's beyond you.

1000
01:26:13,329 --> 01:26:18,543
I'd have to explain to you the sound
of the wind and the smell of the woods.

1001
01:26:18,751 --> 01:26:21,254
I'd have to create you
all over again...

1002
01:26:21,462 --> 01:26:27,301
...and stamp out all those years you spent
on the dirty pavement in cramped shoes.

1003
01:26:30,325 --> 01:26:33,349
I'm not interested in your hunting.

1004
01:26:35,226 --> 01:26:39,397
It doesn't mean a thing to me except
when it interferes with the picture.

1005
01:26:39,501 --> 01:26:42,838
How is it interfering
with the picture? When?

1006
01:26:43,046 --> 01:26:47,113
I haven't even gotten the last section
of the script yet!

1007
01:26:48,051 --> 01:26:52,848
Oh, dear. Well, I'll correct
that immediately.

1008
01:26:52,952 --> 01:26:54,203
Kivu!

1009
01:26:59,938 --> 01:27:01,711
You've finished your rewrites, have you?

1010
01:27:01,919 --> 01:27:05,673
He polished it, Pete,
and gave it a little balls.

1011
01:27:07,967 --> 01:27:11,304
It has to be typed.
Copies have to be made.

1012
01:27:15,266 --> 01:27:17,039
The ape!

1013
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:20,688
Somebody get hold
of the goddamned ape!

1014
01:27:53,325 --> 01:27:57,496
Frontal brain shot!
And for God's sake, don't miss!

1015
01:28:04,065 --> 01:28:08,340
Oh, God. This makes
it all so worthwhile.

1016
01:29:33,217 --> 01:29:37,493
-Oh, isn't this wonderful?
-My God, what a performance.

1017
01:29:37,701 --> 01:29:42,080
-They really love him, don't they?
-They sure do.

1018
01:29:47,815 --> 01:29:50,526
Or, if you've got time
this afternoon, we could--

1019
01:29:50,735 --> 01:29:52,403
John, scene 244.

1020
01:29:52,508 --> 01:29:57,200
Pete, I'm surprised to see you here,
last night. I thought you'd be in Paris...

1021
01:29:57,304 --> 01:30:01,579
...devoting yourself to literature and all
those things you know nothing about.

1022
01:30:01,683 --> 01:30:05,750
Yeah? Well, I thought you'd have
your big tusker by now.

1023
01:30:08,253 --> 01:30:11,902
Stick around, kid. Stick around.

1024
01:30:23,789 --> 01:30:25,457
When do we start?

1025
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:35,676
Shit.

1026
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:51,421
No shooting today, folks.

1027
01:30:51,734 --> 01:30:54,132
Where you going, John? John!

1028
01:30:54,236 --> 01:30:57,052
I'm going hunting. We can't shoot
the sequence in the rain.

1029
01:30:57,156 --> 01:31:01,431
-Well, how long will the rain last?
-Oh, it could last for days.

1030
01:31:01,640 --> 01:31:04,351
It's the beginning of the rainy season.

1031
01:31:04,455 --> 01:31:07,583
Why didn't somebody tell us
about a rainy season?

1032
01:31:07,687 --> 01:31:10,711
I did! I told Mr. Wilson.

1033
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:15,925
He just said, well, the days he couldn't
shoot the film, he could shoot elephant.

1034
01:31:19,783 --> 01:31:23,641
At this rate, I'll be in debt
the rest of my life.

1035
01:31:38,552 --> 01:31:41,158
-Come here, you little devil!
-Now, I feel this...

1036
01:31:41,367 --> 01:31:46,164
...this change is appropriate, but John
seems to think it's a bit complicated.

1037
01:31:46,372 --> 01:31:47,832
Why complicated?

1038
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:54,088
That's a good question, Kay. And if l
could sit John down someday, I'd ask.

1039
01:31:57,425 --> 01:32:00,553
No luck? No elephants?

1040
01:32:01,179 --> 01:32:07,122
Well, we saw plenty of them. We just
didn't see the big tusker. The one I want.

1041
01:32:07,331 --> 01:32:12,023
We'll get one. These rains won't
stop for another week yet.

1042
01:32:12,544 --> 01:32:14,317
You think so?

1043
01:32:20,782 --> 01:32:22,137
Shit.

1044
01:33:28,350 --> 01:33:33,355
It's going to be a clear day.
We can finally start the picture.

1045
01:33:39,507 --> 01:33:42,426
I'm sending the company
to Kivu's village.

1046
01:33:48,578 --> 01:33:52,958
John, we've been sitting
here for five days.

1047
01:33:56,294 --> 01:34:00,257
We're already a week behind.
We haven't even got one shot.

1048
01:34:09,015 --> 01:34:10,475
All right.

1049
01:34:20,485 --> 01:34:25,490
-All right! Let's make a movie!
-I'll believe that when I see it.

1050
01:34:40,088 --> 01:34:43,008
Boss! Boss! Boss!

1051
01:34:47,700 --> 01:34:50,933
He never looks at the script, does he?

1052
01:34:51,350 --> 01:34:56,042
Nope. He's afraid he'll lose
his artistic spontaneity.

1053
01:34:57,293 --> 01:35:01,255
What are you two grousing about?
What's wrong, Paul?

1054
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:04,801
I'm on the spot. I'm ready to make
magic. Make you rich.

1055
01:35:05,009 --> 01:35:07,929
-What the hell's the matter with you?
-Nothing.

1056
01:35:08,033 --> 01:35:13,664
Wait. John. Kivu sent him.
He's onto a big herd.

1057
01:35:13,872 --> 01:35:16,375
-Is that right?
-About three miles from here.

1058
01:35:16,375 --> 01:35:18,356
What are we waiting on?

1059
01:35:20,441 --> 01:35:22,214
John, the sky is clear.

1060
01:35:22,423 --> 01:35:26,176
You've got plenty of unloading to do.
Plenty of work. I'll be right back.

1061
01:35:26,489 --> 01:35:32,433
-Well, how do I know you'll come back?
-Send your boy Pete if you don't trust me.

1062
01:35:33,475 --> 01:35:36,499
Go with him. Make sure he doesn't forget
we're starting a picture.

1063
01:35:36,708 --> 01:35:41,087
-He doesn't need me.
-That's right. And it may be risky.

1064
01:36:31,555 --> 01:36:33,327
You're onto a big one?

1065
01:36:34,370 --> 01:36:35,934
What's he saying?

1066
01:36:39,583 --> 01:36:41,460
We'll leave the boy here.

1067
01:36:46,257 --> 01:36:47,717
John.

1068
01:36:49,594 --> 01:36:51,887
Please, let's go back.
They're waiting for us.

1069
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:54,286
Well, let them wait.

1070
01:37:14,514 --> 01:37:19,102
Bad country, this. Walk right up to
a big tusker before you'd ever see him.

1071
01:37:49,133 --> 01:37:53,408
-What's he saying?
-He says they're just beyond these trees.

1072
01:38:36,993 --> 01:38:40,538
It's a big one, all right. But there
are cows and young ones with him.

1073
01:38:40,747 --> 01:38:44,605
-What do we do?
-It's no good. I don't like it.

1074
01:38:45,126 --> 01:38:48,150
-What does Kivu say?
-I don't care what he says.

1075
01:38:48,254 --> 01:38:51,591
I've killed more than 500 of them.
And I'll tell you, this is not the day.

1076
01:38:51,904 --> 01:38:55,136
How many chances does a man get?

1077
01:38:56,179 --> 01:38:58,265
That's never a reason
to do something wrong.

1078
01:38:58,473 --> 01:39:01,393
Would you ask Kivu what he thinks?

1079
01:39:08,066 --> 01:39:11,820
-He says he's willing to try.
-Of course he's willing. He's got guts.

1080
01:39:12,028 --> 01:39:14,948
Jesus Christ, John! Give it up.

1081
01:39:15,574 --> 01:39:20,162
-It's his word against mine, Mr. Wilson.
-I'm asking, will you come along?

1082
01:39:22,038 --> 01:39:23,707
Come on, Kivu.

1083
01:41:14,547 --> 01:41:16,320
No!

1084
01:44:38,919 --> 01:44:44,237
What are they saying, Ogilvy?
What are the drums saying?

1085
01:44:44,446 --> 01:44:49,347
They're telling everybody what happened,
that's all. The bad news.

1086
01:44:53,622 --> 01:44:57,375
-It always starts with the same words.
-What are they?

1087
01:45:00,191 --> 01:45:04,257
White hunter. Black heart.

1088
01:45:10,409 --> 01:45:14,476
White hunter. Black heart.

1089
01:45:31,159 --> 01:45:36,164
You were right, Pete.
The ending is all wrong.

1090
01:46:11,825 --> 01:46:14,536
John, we're ready.

1091
01:46:35,599 --> 01:46:39,979
All right, quiet please, everyone.
Ready, Miss Gibson?

1092
01:46:53,013 --> 01:46:54,577
Ready, Mr. Wilson?

1093
01:46:56,662 --> 01:46:58,226
Roll them!

1094
01:46:58,747 --> 01:47:00,416
Speed.

1095
01:47:05,421 --> 01:47:08,966
-Mark it.
-Scene one, take one.

1096
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:23,564
Action.

1097
01:47:25,564 --> 01:47:59,564
