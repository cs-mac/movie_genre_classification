1
00:00:48,046 --> 00:00:52,255
The GRA, Great Ring Road,
is the longest urban motorway in Italy.

2
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,967
It encircles the city of Rome
like a ring of Saturn.

3
00:01:50,864 --> 00:01:53,384
Hi, it's 617 speaking, do me a favour:

4
00:01:53,455 --> 00:01:57,046
Can you cancel the fire department
intervention for my rescue?

5
00:01:57,115 --> 00:02:00,819
We took the patient out of
the ditch by ourselves.

6
00:02:04,448 --> 00:02:07,898
Keep calm! We're going to put
this on you to stay warm.

7
00:02:08,018 --> 00:02:09,033
OK?

8
00:02:09,274 --> 00:02:11,675
No, no...
- It'll keep you warm.

9
00:02:14,126 --> 00:02:18,233
It's good for you! It keeps you warm,
understand? You won't feel cold.

10
00:02:20,187 --> 00:02:22,288
Then we'll unwrap you on Easter!

11
00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:27,020
Stay calm with your hands!
No, no, no, no, no.

12
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:30,599
Keep calm, please!

13
00:02:31,174 --> 00:02:34,407
You need to stay warm,
it's cold outside, come on!

14
00:02:34,903 --> 00:02:36,995
We put this on you on purpose.

15
00:04:39,486 --> 00:04:41,485
South-east palm...

16
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,236
number 06...

17
00:04:45,981 --> 00:04:47,914
absence of noise.

18
00:05:06,841 --> 00:05:08,073
Oasis' eye...

19
00:05:09,172 --> 00:05:11,257
palm 6, side...

20
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:13,818
South-east.

21
00:05:14,866 --> 00:05:15,947
Presence...

22
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,869
of noise...

23
00:05:19,774 --> 00:05:21,275
larvae's squeaking...

24
00:05:23,306 --> 00:05:25,957
And adults' noise,
immediate intervention.

25
00:05:26,769 --> 00:05:27,793
Stop.

26
00:05:55,863 --> 00:05:57,020
<i>We are at...</i>

27
00:05:57,129 --> 00:06:01,146
<i>at the exit of the Ring Road.
You must take exit number 2,</i>

28
00:06:01,654 --> 00:06:04,094
<i>Boccea, and drive through via Boccea.</i>

29
00:06:05,495 --> 00:06:07,093
<i>We can rent</i>

30
00:06:08,147 --> 00:06:11,053
<i>for any kind of location.</i>

31
00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:14,255
<i>For cinema, theatre,</i>

32
00:06:14,557 --> 00:06:15,757
<i>fashion shows,</i>

33
00:06:16,017 --> 00:06:17,367
<i>birthday parties.</i>

34
00:06:17,438 --> 00:06:18,466
<i>Yes.</i>

35
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,530
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

36
00:06:23,712 --> 00:06:26,174
For an aristocratic house, let's say.

37
00:06:29,528 --> 00:06:32,076
Yes, we have a huge hall.

38
00:06:35,108 --> 00:06:36,133
Yes, sure.

39
00:06:37,183 --> 00:06:40,922
We offer bed-and-brecfas.
We offer bed-and-brefast.

40
00:06:41,992 --> 00:06:42,995
Yes.

41
00:06:51,047 --> 00:06:52,057
Yes.

42
00:06:57,728 --> 00:06:58,738
Yes.

43
00:06:59,947 --> 00:07:01,758
About ten episodes, yes.

44
00:07:03,218 --> 00:07:07,593
Only one, it's one episode at the moment.
A pilot, let's say.

45
00:07:11,707 --> 00:07:12,753
Yes.

46
00:09:44,328 --> 00:09:48,368
The eyelash of a mask, oh my!
Wait, wait, I'll put something!

47
00:09:50,134 --> 00:09:51,875
The report says:

48
00:09:52,255 --> 00:09:55,337
"Lewd acts, completely naked".
- With nothing on?

49
00:09:55,852 --> 00:09:57,885
But I'm completely dressed!

50
00:09:58,261 --> 00:10:01,912
The report says, "We caught her
in the car, completely naked".

51
00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:05,799
So, it's an offence!
- I went to the police.

52
00:10:05,869 --> 00:10:07,656
So, now...
- I went to the police,

53
00:10:07,726 --> 00:10:11,040
I spoke with the captain:
"It says completely naked...

54
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,366
and I am dressed!

55
00:10:12,436 --> 00:10:15,367
I come to work dressed as
when I go out. Why naked?

56
00:10:15,437 --> 00:10:17,356
I can report you, y'know?"
- Sure!

57
00:10:17,426 --> 00:10:20,365
"Lady, go on, talk to a lawyer", said he.
- Sure!

58
00:10:20,435 --> 00:10:22,857
I'll talk to a lawyer.
- Go to the peace officer,

59
00:10:22,927 --> 00:10:25,722
tell him the situation.
- Lots of people at his office.

60
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,630
No, no more now.

61
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,304
I went, but the queue was fucking long.

62
00:10:30,373 --> 00:10:32,772
Make a sacrifice, gal.
- No, I'll get a lawyer!

63
00:10:32,842 --> 00:10:36,089
OK, get a lawyer,
tell him they're piling...

64
00:10:36,158 --> 00:10:39,811
A bunch of lies.
- I get a lawyer, I tell him the facts,

65
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,902
so I'll write to the mayor,
they can't do this! "Naked in the car"...

66
00:10:44,219 --> 00:10:46,382
I'm really... composed.

67
00:10:50,993 --> 00:10:52,772
Eat it, this mozzarella is good.

68
00:10:52,842 --> 00:10:55,621
Yes, but it's not mozzarella.
- They're called braids.

69
00:10:56,025 --> 00:10:58,915
I like braids more than mozzarella
- I know but...

70
00:10:58,985 --> 00:11:01,805
is it your food or mine?

71
00:11:16,931 --> 00:11:18,645
I'm starving.

72
00:13:57,626 --> 00:13:59,004
If I take...

73
00:13:59,683 --> 00:14:02,970
French eels. Right?

74
00:14:03,261 --> 00:14:06,790
Then I take those from America,
then those from Africa,

75
00:14:07,232 --> 00:14:11,330
and I bring them to Italy,
with our waters, and our problems,

76
00:14:11,778 --> 00:14:14,997
if this eel that I bring over
has 10 microbes

77
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:17,035
in Italy they grow to 2 million,

78
00:14:17,105 --> 00:14:20,490
because they have
a different life and habitat.

79
00:14:21,016 --> 00:14:25,588
Then we mix all these microbes...
we put them all together...

80
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:27,228
But I say,

81
00:14:27,574 --> 00:14:31,276
if you wanna do research, OK?
Then do it...

82
00:14:31,493 --> 00:14:35,765
In Russia, in America, do it where
the hell you want, with your stuff...

83
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:37,335
but don't mix it up!

84
00:14:38,731 --> 00:14:42,760
You want to create an eel livestock?
Do it with the Italian eel!

85
00:14:43,405 --> 00:14:47,299
What's the need to go elsewhere...
to do some crap?

86
00:15:09,703 --> 00:15:12,354
Here's another, Irè.
This is a real laugh!

87
00:15:12,477 --> 00:15:14,585
Listen to this, Irè!
So then...

88
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:20,869
"Eels are traditionally fished
and eaten during winter". Right!

89
00:15:22,342 --> 00:15:26,229
"That is, right after reproduction".
Says who?

90
00:15:26,886 --> 00:15:29,486
If they reproduce in the Sargasso Sea,

91
00:15:29,727 --> 00:15:32,578
how can I eat an eel
right after reproduction?

92
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,832
I'd have to fish it in the Sargasso Sea!

93
00:15:36,732 --> 00:15:38,946
This is a jumbo nonsense!

94
00:15:44,337 --> 00:15:47,335
"Once again it shifts on who buys...

95
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:51,481
Dear citizens, our 30% of land,
for the obstruct..."

96
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,323
Aw, come on, go learn the language!

97
00:15:54,393 --> 00:15:55,697
Go to school!

98
00:16:06,876 --> 00:16:08,885
This is really rubbish, Irè!

99
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:12,189
Better throw away everything,
and so long!

100
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,482
We're truly in the hands of people
that understand nothing, and zilch.

101
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,950
But us, who spend an entire life
on the water, nobody consults us.

102
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,620
Nobody cares about us.

103
00:16:24,881 --> 00:16:26,027
Right, Irè?

104
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:31,720
What do you say, Irè?
It's alright as is?

105
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:33,907
Let's go on, what do we care!

106
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,163
If you keep on cutting and sewing...

107
00:16:52,726 --> 00:16:54,427
We'll call you Penelope!

108
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:12,362
<i>Yes!</i>

109
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,770
<i>Yes, yes, tell him yes.</i>

110
00:17:16,685 --> 00:17:20,869
<i>Exactly, this is it. Stop the other unit,
we're already there ourselves.</i>

111
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,935
<i>Alright, I'll call you back soon.</i>

112
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,796
<i>Look at all those flyers!</i>

113
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:55,310
<i>What the fuck did he do? - They went on
a binge. Look at how he wrecked the car!</i>

114
00:17:56,757 --> 00:18:00,912
<i>Where is he, still inside? - I don't know.
- Careful for the gasoline.</i>

115
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:12,701
Gentlemen, will you go away
with those cars? We can't pass.

116
00:18:15,592 --> 00:18:16,815
One is fine.

117
00:18:24,472 --> 00:18:25,972
Come give me a hand.

118
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,511
<i>Unit 617 heading to Sant'Andrea Hospital.</i>

119
00:18:44,371 --> 00:18:47,515
Where is the Sant'Andrea?
- Here on the Ring Road.

120
00:18:53,197 --> 00:18:55,406
<i>Unit 617 heading to Sant'Andrea.</i>

121
00:18:59,137 --> 00:19:01,143
<i>Headquarters?
Received?</i>

122
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:03,778
<i>Look, the 113 does not respond.</i>

123
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,740
Hey, can I work tomorrow?

124
00:19:09,196 --> 00:19:12,070
I don't think so.
Moreover, some rest won't hurt you.

125
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,303
Rest? Who the fuck will pay me?

126
00:19:14,523 --> 00:19:15,691
Come to me.

127
00:19:16,006 --> 00:19:17,504
I give away money!

128
00:19:20,455 --> 00:19:23,010
Are we already there?
- Yes. - Wow!

129
00:19:23,482 --> 00:19:27,959
I could have gone on foot to the hospital!
- No, you'd have gone in projection!

130
00:19:28,029 --> 00:19:29,080
Going!

131
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,869
Go, it's loose...

132
00:20:48,673 --> 00:20:50,479
Look what a show!

133
00:20:50,724 --> 00:20:55,186
Over there, St. Peter's dome. No doubt,
the dome can be seen just everywhere!

134
00:20:56,379 --> 00:20:57,391
Look.

135
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,054
Over there.

136
00:21:03,116 --> 00:21:05,900
You know, I was observing that...
I don't know!

137
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:08,121
These houses, are they inhabited?

138
00:21:08,384 --> 00:21:13,309
Which ones? - These here.
- The terraced houses? - Yes, those.

139
00:21:14,256 --> 00:21:16,610
There is nobody!
- These up front or over there?

140
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:20,131
Here there was a light, last night.
You know, this new house?

141
00:21:20,201 --> 00:21:23,099
Yes, they're inhabited, at times...
- This one, yes.

142
00:21:23,168 --> 00:21:25,719
But in those ones there is never a light.

143
00:21:26,366 --> 00:21:30,366
Nothing - Maybe they're not as blind
as me, so they don't need light.

144
00:21:30,436 --> 00:21:33,229
Don't you say, come on,
but it's not possible!

145
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:36,906
When a house is occupied and inhabited,
some light can be seen.

146
00:21:36,976 --> 00:21:42,352
Not that I spend the evenings to check,
but definitely I would see something.

147
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,347
I don't know, I never noticed.

148
00:21:46,417 --> 00:21:49,194
No, there is someone there,
on the ground floor.

149
00:21:49,414 --> 00:21:55,001
Those who have, y'know, dogs, the black
and white dog... - No - that play... Here!

150
00:21:55,644 --> 00:21:57,245
In the lawn

151
00:21:57,634 --> 00:21:59,677
adjacent to this ours,

152
00:22:00,331 --> 00:22:02,431
where there are those two trees.

153
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,783
Do it right, look - Yes Mum, I understand.
- This way. Careful, it drips.

154
00:22:08,188 --> 00:22:10,367
At least we leave it all clean.

155
00:22:10,947 --> 00:22:11,968
Got it?

156
00:22:12,038 --> 00:22:16,087
Well, I did all these signs myself!
- You've done them all indeed!

157
00:22:16,157 --> 00:22:19,713
You don't write on the walls.
- But it's fun writing on the walls.

158
00:22:19,924 --> 00:22:23,231
I know, but you can't.
- Can I write in the bedroom? - No!

159
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:24,742
Not in the new room.

160
00:22:24,812 --> 00:22:28,264
Nor here you may,
because here there'll be another family.

161
00:22:31,243 --> 00:22:33,754
No, because Lawrence Durrell

162
00:22:34,411 --> 00:22:36,457
was in workforce at...

163
00:22:39,175 --> 00:22:40,774
At the Foreign Office.

164
00:22:43,767 --> 00:22:45,088
Like his father.

165
00:22:49,949 --> 00:22:55,064
He's dead? - Don't you remember his story
of the famous fan, that is, this blade

166
00:22:55,216 --> 00:22:59,286
made of palm leaves, which
came and went over the table of

167
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:03,632
of the dining room, which
at one point dropped a boa,

168
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:05,717
a python, what was it?

169
00:23:06,488 --> 00:23:08,474
In the midst of the diners.

170
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:10,758
Funny, huh?

171
00:23:11,658 --> 00:23:12,718
Exciting.

172
00:23:14,501 --> 00:23:17,904
Poor thing!
It too put itself in a cool place!

173
00:23:21,193 --> 00:23:23,344
What happened to that book there?

174
00:23:23,454 --> 00:23:27,556
We left it somewhere
during our peregrinations.

175
00:24:08,478 --> 00:24:10,492
Nothing. Here nothing moves.

176
00:24:13,944 --> 00:24:16,021
A plane is coming from afar...

177
00:24:19,547 --> 00:24:21,348
Yes, there's a nice view.

178
00:24:22,372 --> 00:24:24,072
You gotta come some day.

179
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:29,737
Yes, it's nice. I just don't know how is
called that one there. A neighbourhood,

180
00:24:29,807 --> 00:24:32,458
to my right, I don't
know what place it is.

181
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,990
Nice! A beautiful panorama.

182
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:40,686
Yes, yes.

183
00:25:11,735 --> 00:25:13,903
Should I put this on?
- Yes, nice.

184
00:25:13,973 --> 00:25:17,075
Where did you buy it?
- It's old, from Yamamay.

185
00:25:18,284 --> 00:25:21,084
Y'know that I never find
anything at Yamamay?

186
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:24,318
OK!
- That is, none of these things, I mean.

187
00:25:26,643 --> 00:25:29,664
I've been trying to take off
this lipstick for two hours.

188
00:25:30,256 --> 00:25:32,890
Then red! It's beautiful, by all means!

189
00:25:33,063 --> 00:25:35,732
Only that Valeria made me
put it on for an event...

190
00:25:35,802 --> 00:25:38,467
When we did the Playboy girls.

191
00:25:39,116 --> 00:25:41,764
With red lipstick I become truly a whore.

192
00:25:42,376 --> 00:25:46,027
Yeah, I get a slutty face.
- Yes, red is vulgar on some girls.

193
00:25:46,097 --> 00:25:47,897
True, I'm brunette, dear...

194
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:52,112
Even without make-up,
with red lipstick I seem a slut.

195
00:25:52,182 --> 00:25:56,682
I mean, I give really the idea of a whore.
- Yeah, it stresses you more. - Yes.

196
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,891
Despite that they told me that
red lipstick suits me, honestly.

197
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:04,938
Yet I see myself as a bitch with it.
- I know...

198
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,319
Ready?
- Ready to go!

199
00:26:13,969 --> 00:26:14,992
Vamos.

200
00:27:33,622 --> 00:27:36,523
I'm at work, now I stopped
for a second, alone.

201
00:29:23,324 --> 00:29:25,696
Lallarella! Good morning!

202
00:29:27,971 --> 00:29:29,286
Hi, Lapiz!

203
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:36,959
<i>So, tell me the menu today.</i>
- Menu today: cold pasta...

204
00:29:38,906 --> 00:29:40,353
I put tomatoes...

205
00:29:41,336 --> 00:29:42,407
tuna...

206
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:44,892
and mozzarella.

207
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:48,239
<i>Why not some oregano?</i>

208
00:29:49,681 --> 00:29:54,840
I don't have it! Now don't start, though!
It's already so much what I'm doing!

209
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:02,964
Are you sighing, lover?

210
00:30:04,354 --> 00:30:08,296
I was on a second motorbike,
a friend of us was ahead alone,

211
00:30:08,829 --> 00:30:10,186
because he had...

212
00:30:11,814 --> 00:30:13,828
Some provisions with him...

213
00:30:14,797 --> 00:30:16,600
<i>A truck overtook us,</i>

214
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,358
<i>with a trailer.</i>

215
00:30:20,167 --> 00:30:21,467
<i>Unfortunately,</i>

216
00:30:22,098 --> 00:30:23,714
<i>getting back in lane,</i>

217
00:30:24,326 --> 00:30:25,976
<i>it hit full on</i>

218
00:30:26,689 --> 00:30:29,566
<i>our friend who was ahead.</i>
- I'll be damned!

219
00:30:30,338 --> 00:30:32,659
<i>He was thrown on that...</i>

220
00:30:33,295 --> 00:30:34,429
<i>rocky...</i>

221
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,172
<i>wall...</i>

222
00:30:38,059 --> 00:30:41,057
<i>I won't tell you where
they found his brain.</i>

223
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:46,327
Darling, tell me something good.
You're only saying ugly things.

224
00:30:46,397 --> 00:30:48,249
I work all day on an ambulance,

225
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:50,818
and you come with all these misfortunes!

226
00:31:05,415 --> 00:31:07,716
Do I get in too?
- Come on, get in.

227
00:31:07,829 --> 00:31:09,781
Get in. Long as we're here.

228
00:31:14,094 --> 00:31:16,447
Now comes the police: "Your ID"...

229
00:31:17,151 --> 00:31:20,502
"What are you doing here?
You gotta go away, it's time."

230
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:26,296
What can you do?
This is our shitty life, sadly.

231
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,951
Some got a lot
and some have not.

232
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:31,772
Look at that pot belly!

233
00:31:32,227 --> 00:31:35,597
He looks like Buddha, and is even a cop.
Look at his belly!

234
00:31:36,157 --> 00:31:38,608
The belly gets there a mile before him!

235
00:31:40,369 --> 00:31:43,920
What can you do? That's life.
It's gonna get cold, winter...

236
00:31:45,061 --> 00:31:47,114
I gotta buy a pair of boots...

237
00:31:47,618 --> 00:31:48,684
tomorrow.

238
00:31:50,713 --> 00:31:52,663
What can you do? That's life!

239
00:32:23,197 --> 00:32:25,198
Why are you singing a lullaby?

240
00:32:26,547 --> 00:32:27,849
This song?

241
00:32:30,567 --> 00:32:31,608
Quiet!

242
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:28,403
Headquarters, unit 617 on the spot.

243
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,911
<i>Come in.</i>

244
00:33:53,371 --> 00:33:57,721
Warn the Sant'Andrea that we're coming
with a code 3. We need a resuscitator.

245
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:00,988
<i>I'll call them.</i>

246
00:34:01,113 --> 00:34:02,115
One...

247
00:34:03,044 --> 00:34:04,758
Go on, two.
- One, two,

248
00:34:04,827 --> 00:34:08,085
three, four five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten...

249
00:34:17,151 --> 00:34:19,299
Go, one...
- Some more oxygen.

250
00:34:20,965 --> 00:34:24,618
Two.
- One, two, three, four five, six, seven...

251
00:34:31,491 --> 00:34:35,000
...24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.
Go!

252
00:34:43,685 --> 00:34:45,112
Red palm weevil...

253
00:34:48,095 --> 00:34:50,030
The true enemy of the palm.

254
00:34:51,749 --> 00:34:53,650
They have a social structure

255
00:34:54,039 --> 00:34:55,540
perfectly organised.

256
00:34:57,602 --> 00:34:59,019
Some individuals,

257
00:35:00,552 --> 00:35:02,171
particularly gifted,

258
00:35:03,209 --> 00:35:05,205
can smell the prey

259
00:35:07,448 --> 00:35:08,952
at a long distance.

260
00:35:13,494 --> 00:35:14,631
And thus,

261
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:18,278
they call

262
00:35:18,865 --> 00:35:20,321
their peers

263
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:24,053
to organise group orgies.

264
00:35:25,228 --> 00:35:28,794
They then hurl themselves
on the individual and start,

265
00:35:31,201 --> 00:35:33,150
after having spawned,

266
00:35:34,138 --> 00:35:35,507
to colonise it.

267
00:35:37,065 --> 00:35:38,352
They feed on it

268
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:40,478
until its destruction,

269
00:35:41,444 --> 00:35:43,275
and they are not interested

270
00:35:44,084 --> 00:35:45,585
in other individuals

271
00:35:46,026 --> 00:35:47,500
except when

272
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:49,451
that being

273
00:35:50,254 --> 00:35:52,365
has been completely destroyed.

274
00:35:53,296 --> 00:35:55,375
And the cycle begins again.

275
00:35:59,088 --> 00:36:00,539
And it's bad!

276
00:36:02,812 --> 00:36:04,662
For the world of palm trees

277
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:07,571
and symbolically, even for man, because

278
00:36:08,919 --> 00:36:10,144
the palm tree

279
00:36:10,746 --> 00:36:12,799
is shaped like the human soul.

280
00:36:56,829 --> 00:37:00,565
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

281
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:05,525
Blessed art thou among women, and
blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

282
00:37:14,841 --> 00:37:19,447
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners,

283
00:37:19,516 --> 00:37:22,857
now and at the hour
of our death, amen.

284
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:35,333
Glory to the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit.

285
00:37:35,403 --> 00:37:40,581
As it was in the beginning,
is now and ever, forever and ever, amen.

286
00:37:40,651 --> 00:37:46,960
Virgin of Revelation, pray for us
and give us the love of God.

287
00:38:14,961 --> 00:38:16,806
No, she saw it...

288
00:38:22,248 --> 00:38:23,540
It's blurry.

289
00:38:38,515 --> 00:38:40,316
Look, look at the red now!

290
00:38:41,578 --> 00:38:45,299
We are here for them as well,
for those who are not present.

291
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:50,238
We prayed also for the sick,
for all the souls in purgatory.

292
00:38:51,151 --> 00:38:55,151
Here, look at how much red there is now!
Look! How can you not see it?

293
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:57,824
No, I don't see anything.

294
00:38:58,828 --> 00:39:02,179
Then, when I develop the pictures,
I'll show you. - Yes.

295
00:39:03,621 --> 00:39:05,800
Pity, because it's something...

296
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:07,912
Nice to see, and...

297
00:39:08,116 --> 00:39:12,369
I think it's a gift that Our Lady gives us.
Watch how red! - It's brighter...

298
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:17,055
There is the red that pulsates! - Brighter
and dimmer, yes! - Can you see it now?

299
00:39:17,126 --> 00:39:20,294
You see? Look how red it is now!
- Yes. - Look!

300
00:39:20,363 --> 00:39:21,962
Oh! Finally!

301
00:39:26,778 --> 00:39:27,928
<i>Hi Umberto!</i>

302
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,755
<i>Well, just getting by!</i>

303
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,810
<i>How about yourself?</i>

304
00:39:37,054 --> 00:39:41,026
<i>Holy crap! This Ring Road! Goddammit!</i>

305
00:39:41,648 --> 00:39:45,230
I'd swear every saint,
I can't stand it anymore!

306
00:39:45,526 --> 00:39:48,688
And good thing that I took off early!
And then,

307
00:39:48,996 --> 00:39:53,072
a girl I'm helping is waiting for me,
we're shooting together.

308
00:39:55,549 --> 00:39:58,859
I was called by the director
of a photonovel, I'm working,

309
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:01,014
he gave me a role as butler.

310
00:40:21,875 --> 00:40:24,840
<i>You come into the field, and wait...</i>

311
00:40:25,346 --> 00:40:28,346
<i>...and you stay farther there.
I say "Let's go"...</i>

312
00:40:33,474 --> 00:40:37,900
<i>So, are we ready?
Let me see the framing... Good.</i>

313
00:40:39,233 --> 00:40:40,264
Hold it!

314
00:40:42,548 --> 00:40:44,149
Hold on just a sec.

315
00:40:44,824 --> 00:40:48,546
Here it is. The framing,
I just need to tighten it a bit.

316
00:40:51,906 --> 00:40:53,731
The camera is acting up.

317
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:55,966
We're good.

318
00:40:57,003 --> 00:40:58,025
Hold it.

319
00:40:58,601 --> 00:40:59,663
Okay...

320
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,826
I go a bit more on them.

321
00:41:01,896 --> 00:41:03,647
Hold it like that, still.

322
00:41:04,284 --> 00:41:05,297
Hold on.

323
00:41:06,204 --> 00:41:08,315
That's it. This is good.

324
00:41:09,089 --> 00:41:11,390
"Doctor, maybe...". Twist your hands.

325
00:41:11,708 --> 00:41:14,278
"I've never heard about that agency".

326
00:41:14,861 --> 00:41:16,952
Touch him here, "Are you sure?"

327
00:41:17,851 --> 00:41:19,451
"Are you sure that...?"

328
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:22,053
Gaetano, you must look this way.
Good.

329
00:41:22,123 --> 00:41:25,715
I'll take you like that,
now you're also wondering that they

330
00:41:25,785 --> 00:41:27,286
sent you something...

331
00:41:45,908 --> 00:41:47,850
Hold on. He suspects that...

332
00:41:48,532 --> 00:41:51,291
That you're in cahoots
with someone else...

333
00:41:51,613 --> 00:41:52,623
Hold on.

334
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:58,373
All right. You're gone. It's all Ugo on
Ugo's thoughts. Hold still, look here.

335
00:41:58,919 --> 00:42:01,370
And you say: "There's something wrong."

336
00:42:02,303 --> 00:42:04,608
There, even more in the foreground.

337
00:42:06,281 --> 00:42:07,311
Perfect!

338
00:42:07,633 --> 00:42:12,401
Now, come closer.
Gateano stays behind to listen to what...

339
00:42:12,564 --> 00:42:14,865
That's it, stay there in the middle.

340
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:16,172
Now you turn.

341
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:19,693
"So, little girl!"
Put your hands like that. Here you are.

342
00:42:20,113 --> 00:42:24,212
"Little girl, I spoke with your father.
I know everything". Hold it!

343
00:42:25,093 --> 00:42:26,645
Hold it, it's good.

344
00:42:38,974 --> 00:42:41,075
Look how pretty you are!

345
00:42:41,537 --> 00:42:43,649
Yes, these photos came out good.

346
00:42:43,834 --> 00:42:45,770
Did the director like them?

347
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:49,140
Yes. Indeed he chose these,
he took some of yours,

348
00:42:49,211 --> 00:42:53,299
he didn't consider at all the other ones,
the more professional ones.

349
00:42:54,605 --> 00:42:58,558
He said that for the photo novels
he preferred this kind.

350
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:04,791
Just think, you make me remember
when I was an extra.

351
00:43:05,658 --> 00:43:07,327
I was in my twenties.

352
00:43:08,067 --> 00:43:10,515
Me too, do you think it's been easy?

353
00:43:10,949 --> 00:43:14,041
Oh, yeah!
I even found who wanted to bang me!

354
00:43:14,775 --> 00:43:16,674
I've always avoided that.

355
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,454
Got it?

356
00:43:19,131 --> 00:43:21,031
You've never given yourself?

357
00:43:21,232 --> 00:43:23,682
I never gave myself. But I'll tell you,

358
00:43:23,957 --> 00:43:26,032
if they had chosen me

359
00:43:26,399 --> 00:43:28,858
as the leading actor for a movie,

360
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:32,292
I'd have given it.
I'm telling the truth.

361
00:43:33,853 --> 00:43:35,253
Do you believe me?

362
00:43:35,878 --> 00:43:39,137
The worst thing, if they had said:
"Hey, Gaetano...

363
00:43:39,756 --> 00:43:41,508
see what you can do."

364
00:43:42,339 --> 00:43:44,163
I'd have never done that!

365
00:43:44,617 --> 00:43:48,028
But, if they had asked me

366
00:43:48,098 --> 00:43:50,449
"to pick up the coin" we say in Rome,

367
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:52,269
in doggy position,

368
00:43:52,455 --> 00:43:54,030
do it softly...

369
00:43:54,323 --> 00:43:55,696
I'd have done it!

370
00:43:55,767 --> 00:43:59,016
"On the 18th of March of 1917,

371
00:43:59,086 --> 00:44:00,864
seen the birth certificate,

372
00:44:00,935 --> 00:44:05,362
Odilio Domenico Pellegrini was born in
Giuliopoli di Rosello, province of Chieti,

373
00:44:05,432 --> 00:44:07,133
the son of Don Vincenzo.

374
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:10,895
Awarded with the Knighthood
of the Italian Republic,

375
00:44:11,095 --> 00:44:14,854
Earl of Dibriade by hereditary right,
Count of Rosello,

376
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:19,075
Lord of Giuliopoli, Grand Officer
of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem,

377
00:44:19,307 --> 00:44:23,860
Commendatore of the Crown of Italy, Knight
of the Order of St. Maurice and Lazarus,

378
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:26,755
Prince of the Holy Roman
Empire of Castelrosso,

379
00:44:26,825 --> 00:44:29,944
graduated in Sociology
at the Accademia Tiberina,

380
00:44:30,268 --> 00:44:33,714
and Senator of the United States
of America, Honoris Causa.

381
00:44:33,783 --> 00:44:37,244
In witness whereof, the mayor:
Salvatore Paolini." OK.

382
00:44:38,013 --> 00:44:43,005
We'll give this paper to the Lithuanian
delegation of the Knights of St. Casimir.

383
00:44:44,395 --> 00:44:45,423
Good.

384
00:44:45,493 --> 00:44:46,785
I'm satisfied.

385
00:47:11,672 --> 00:47:15,919
I'll tell you, I sniffed it so much
that, probably, something...

386
00:47:15,989 --> 00:47:18,590
Was lost? - Was lost, yes.
- It's likely.

387
00:47:20,975 --> 00:47:23,200
Who knows?
Let's wait and see.

388
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:26,705
So it's not you who starts having
a musty odour... - Well...

389
00:47:26,775 --> 00:47:29,725
On the other hand,
I already have a certain age!

390
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:32,293
So, I'm not surprised.

391
00:47:32,875 --> 00:47:34,205
A bit of mould...

392
00:47:34,943 --> 00:47:36,343
There must be, eh?

393
00:47:38,268 --> 00:47:39,413
Look, dear,

394
00:47:39,483 --> 00:47:41,815
it's like the Chateau d'Yquem,

395
00:47:42,244 --> 00:47:46,202
that has that slight aftertaste of mould.

396
00:47:47,618 --> 00:47:52,130
What is Chateau d'Yquem? - And if
it doesn't... It's a wonderful wine,

397
00:47:52,364 --> 00:47:55,766
which, if it doesn't have
that slight mouldy aftertaste...

398
00:47:56,594 --> 00:47:57,634
it doesn't...

399
00:47:58,073 --> 00:48:01,340
More than mouldy, it's rather...
what’s-its-name...

400
00:48:01,638 --> 00:48:03,200
That thing...

401
00:48:03,841 --> 00:48:05,016
Tell me...

402
00:48:05,085 --> 00:48:06,978
Moss, that's what I meant!

403
00:48:07,265 --> 00:48:09,616
Anyway, this doesn't smell like moss!

404
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:12,872
Dunno!

405
00:48:13,845 --> 00:48:18,079
You know what it smells like?
You know the shoes that one

406
00:48:18,309 --> 00:48:21,677
puts away in a space... well, in a...

407
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:24,100
Storage room a bit humid?

408
00:48:24,887 --> 00:48:26,825
Ah, what a connoisseur!

409
00:48:27,015 --> 00:48:28,588
They have right this...

410
00:48:28,657 --> 00:48:29,823
Exactly!

411
00:48:30,062 --> 00:48:33,305
Then you put them on...
- You took a course in...

412
00:48:33,803 --> 00:48:36,920
You put them on, and pull out the sock...

413
00:48:38,615 --> 00:48:42,041
that smells like mould.
- Consider that we'll have to eat it,

414
00:48:42,111 --> 00:48:45,547
so avoid being too...
- No, it's not said that I must eat it.

415
00:48:45,617 --> 00:48:48,086
But first I want to see how it works.

416
00:48:50,536 --> 00:48:53,451
Fact is, mine was coming from the street,

417
00:48:53,521 --> 00:48:55,540
the water from the street,

418
00:48:55,723 --> 00:48:59,036
from the door. - Yes...
- Then, from the bathroom...

419
00:48:59,106 --> 00:49:01,984
Yes...
- ...all the sewer came out... - Yes.

420
00:49:02,826 --> 00:49:05,384
The... the tenant...
- The sewer...

421
00:49:05,453 --> 00:49:06,570
All of it!

422
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,015
The tenant next to me...
- It was out!

423
00:49:09,084 --> 00:49:10,827
Had the gas cylinder

424
00:49:11,097 --> 00:49:13,707
- where I stayed there was no direct gas -

425
00:49:14,063 --> 00:49:17,912
that was floating, the fridge as well...
- Yes, everything was floating!

426
00:49:17,982 --> 00:49:20,809
We cried so much!
- Don't tell me!

427
00:49:21,283 --> 00:49:23,083
Mamma mia, I would never...

428
00:49:23,313 --> 00:49:27,425
Look, I won't wish even to my
worst enemy what happened to me.

429
00:49:27,495 --> 00:49:30,711
Then they sent us to the Fabulous.

430
00:49:31,001 --> 00:49:33,224
You too were at the Fabulous, right?

431
00:49:33,294 --> 00:49:35,434
They sent me first to that hotel,

432
00:49:35,504 --> 00:49:38,360
for some twenty days, something like that,

433
00:49:38,431 --> 00:49:41,250
then to the Fabulous.
- I was fine at the Fabulous.

434
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:44,144
Me too. - Just fine.
- Only, I've been there until...

435
00:49:44,214 --> 00:49:47,609
Until they sent me here.
- It was a campsite, you had your own...

436
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:48,830
Your cottage.

437
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:50,551
Until May, I was there.

438
00:49:50,621 --> 00:49:52,525
From December to May.

439
00:49:53,807 --> 00:49:58,058
And that's it... Then, from there, they
moved us here, anyway... - Yes, yes.

440
00:49:58,128 --> 00:50:00,134
Did you see what a view I got?

441
00:50:00,204 --> 00:50:03,685
Yeah, I saw there are some villas.
- You instead see just

442
00:50:03,755 --> 00:50:05,938
buses and the road.
- Yes, buses.

443
00:50:06,008 --> 00:50:09,295
There are only buses that pass, and cars.
- Yes.

444
00:50:09,497 --> 00:50:11,667
Look at those pretty cottages!

445
00:50:11,737 --> 00:50:16,671
Fine houses, though! A nice green.
- However, it's like a graveyard here.

446
00:50:17,349 --> 00:50:21,774
You don't hear children, or kids playing.
- They seem uninhabited. - Yes.

447
00:50:22,623 --> 00:50:25,274
Only that one seems inhabited, but...

448
00:50:25,883 --> 00:50:27,674
You hardly see anyone.

449
00:50:28,272 --> 00:50:30,891
They're all barricaded. Look there!
- Yes.

450
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:33,437
Poor devils, they're scared.
- They're scared, yes.

451
00:50:33,507 --> 00:50:36,041
But if they're scared, why build here?

452
00:50:36,167 --> 00:50:40,682
Rather, why live here? If one's so scared,
he shouldn't live in such places.

453
00:50:56,218 --> 00:50:58,265
Sure that these are the ones...

454
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:01,187
What... How the heck is it called?

455
00:51:02,318 --> 00:51:05,229
That company... the airline...

456
00:51:07,221 --> 00:51:09,711
The ones that make people
travel standing!

457
00:51:09,781 --> 00:51:10,887
Ryan...

458
00:51:10,957 --> 00:51:12,201
Ah, Ryanair!

459
00:51:12,888 --> 00:51:14,189
That rubbish!

460
00:51:14,623 --> 00:51:15,655
Well...

461
00:51:18,848 --> 00:51:20,125
Think that,

462
00:51:20,412 --> 00:51:21,530
when

463
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:25,575
they started the first connection lines

464
00:51:25,951 --> 00:51:27,059
in...

465
00:51:29,942 --> 00:51:32,385
In Europe

466
00:51:33,088 --> 00:51:36,595
which was on 1900... '30's and something,

467
00:51:37,203 --> 00:51:42,062
Coty made a perfume
that was called "En avion".

468
00:51:43,251 --> 00:51:46,913
Which is to say? On the...
- "In the aeroplane".

469
00:51:47,541 --> 00:51:49,420
And people travelled

470
00:51:49,843 --> 00:51:52,961
sitting on wicker armchairs,

471
00:51:53,996 --> 00:51:56,274
because they weighed the least.

472
00:51:58,408 --> 00:51:59,727
It was beautiful!

473
00:51:59,797 --> 00:52:02,066
Think how cute! So peculiar.

474
00:54:01,445 --> 00:54:05,151
I'm going home, to Centocelle.
Don't do like that!

475
00:54:05,221 --> 00:54:06,958
Come with me, to my place.

476
00:54:07,028 --> 00:54:10,714
No, I'm going to my place.
- Today I'll pay you 50, at my place.

477
00:54:10,784 --> 00:54:13,255
No, to my home, I'm going.

478
00:54:14,018 --> 00:54:16,855
You stud!
- You're hot!

479
00:54:16,926 --> 00:54:19,866
I know I'm hot!
- It must be your dick.

480
00:54:19,936 --> 00:54:23,806
Please, don't be like that! Come on!
- Come on, let's go!

481
00:54:24,433 --> 00:54:26,105
Do you have 5?

482
00:54:26,309 --> 00:54:29,231
5 what? Euro? - To pay the taxi?
- 5 euros?

483
00:54:30,374 --> 00:54:31,858
How much, after?

484
00:54:32,321 --> 00:54:34,356
50 at my place!

485
00:54:34,915 --> 00:54:37,219
I pay 5 euros, then 50?

486
00:54:38,330 --> 00:54:39,941
It's 5 and 50?

487
00:54:40,645 --> 00:54:41,722
Yes!

488
00:54:42,198 --> 00:54:46,027
We go together? - Sure!
- And what're you going to do?

489
00:54:46,394 --> 00:54:50,057
What I'm going to do?
Whatever you want, lover!

490
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:18,492
What is it? You want your lipstick?
Wait, I'll put it on you, come on.

491
00:56:19,668 --> 00:56:22,019
I'll put lipstick on you.
Good girl.

492
00:56:23,282 --> 00:56:25,818
Let's go to apply the gel.
Come on.

493
00:56:26,584 --> 00:56:28,169
Come on, let's go.

494
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:43,472
Let's put on the cloak, quick!

495
00:57:04,915 --> 00:57:07,366
Shall I put the brooch?
- Yes, please.

496
00:57:23,673 --> 00:57:26,166
Can you help me with the cloak, please?

497
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:39,592
Like this?

498
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:42,960
Like this?

499
00:57:44,738 --> 00:57:46,678
We must go. Anastasia.

500
00:57:46,748 --> 00:57:48,401
Come, give me your hand.

501
00:57:48,471 --> 00:57:49,501
Come on.

502
00:58:27,628 --> 00:58:30,904
He said... he happy that you already

503
00:58:31,062 --> 00:58:33,918
have idea to come to Lithuania

504
00:58:34,169 --> 00:58:36,402
because October...

505
00:58:36,472 --> 00:58:40,663
In October? - The 2nd of October,
Engineer, San Casimiro died,

506
00:58:40,961 --> 00:58:45,004
and he was buried in Lithuania in 1484.

507
00:58:45,235 --> 00:58:48,406
We have, in cathedral,
a beautiful chapel,

508
00:58:48,803 --> 00:58:51,439
and there is made big ceremony.

509
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:53,743
He thinks that all of you...

510
00:58:54,737 --> 00:58:57,037
Well, we hope so.
- Yes, yes, yes!

511
00:59:35,439 --> 00:59:37,058
This is perfect!

512
01:00:07,898 --> 01:00:09,804
The scream of the larvae.

513
01:00:29,243 --> 01:00:30,335
Here it is!

514
01:00:33,108 --> 01:00:35,550
This can be extremely helpful...

515
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:39,028
To spread the alarm.

516
01:00:43,147 --> 01:00:44,458
But I have to...

517
01:00:45,865 --> 01:00:48,580
Isolate it, isolate it clean.

518
01:01:01,956 --> 01:01:04,821
Even in theory, a...

519
01:01:05,261 --> 01:01:06,466
A probe...

520
01:01:07,513 --> 01:01:10,886
That transmits the vibrations.

521
01:01:11,528 --> 01:01:13,543
Because they...

522
01:01:14,287 --> 01:01:15,575
Feel...

523
01:01:16,129 --> 01:01:17,347
For sure...

524
01:01:17,832 --> 01:01:19,644
besides the...

525
01:01:20,141 --> 01:01:22,592
In short, they don't have ears like us.

526
01:01:22,771 --> 01:01:26,347
They are immersed in a mass...

527
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:28,449
Okay?

528
01:01:29,472 --> 01:01:32,566
And so, they feel far more...

529
01:01:33,157 --> 01:01:36,870
By contact, sounds that are transmitted

530
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,740
within a solid body.

531
01:01:40,627 --> 01:01:46,334
They don't have the same...
They don't have the same human situation.

532
01:01:48,312 --> 01:01:52,294
Exactly. If I manage
to transmit to the mass

533
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:54,724
this cry of alarm,

534
01:01:56,540 --> 01:02:00,549
to me it's important, because then
I can do other things, on the one hand.

535
01:02:00,619 --> 01:02:04,518
On the other, there are
some sounds of recall...

536
01:02:06,597 --> 01:02:08,658
So, if I

537
01:02:08,962 --> 01:02:14,257
So if I... Factually, I want to achieve
a push-pull, that is, on the one hand,

538
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,591
I want to call them,

539
01:02:17,146 --> 01:02:20,906
and on the other hand,
I want to terrorise them.

540
01:02:32,688 --> 01:02:36,707
This is beautiful, this is the appetiser
of revenge, my dear ones.

541
01:10:14,103 --> 01:10:16,453
What's it saying? Can you understand?

542
01:10:17,527 --> 01:10:18,687
Not quite.

543
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:21,751
So so. <i>- So so.</i>
- "So so"!

544
01:10:25,502 --> 01:10:27,102
Can you see Maria? No!

545
01:10:27,666 --> 01:10:29,767
Huh, Maria? You can see?
- Yes.

546
01:10:30,126 --> 01:10:32,737
I'm getting blind, here.
- I can see well.

547
01:10:32,807 --> 01:10:34,147
You see well...

548
01:10:38,365 --> 01:10:40,121
Now I see!

549
01:10:42,331 --> 01:10:44,432
Cheers!
Lover, cheers!

550
01:10:46,852 --> 01:10:47,853
Cheers!

551
01:10:59,422 --> 01:11:02,224
Is it right my...

552
01:11:02,766 --> 01:11:03,961
Re...

553
01:11:04,135 --> 01:11:05,202
...port.

554
01:11:05,272 --> 01:11:06,523
Eh! My report.

555
01:11:06,593 --> 01:11:07,754
Report...

556
01:11:08,355 --> 01:11:10,322
On... Lucio...

557
01:11:10,765 --> 01:11:11,788
Talpa.

558
01:11:13,204 --> 01:11:14,497
What is Talpa?

559
01:11:16,651 --> 01:11:18,531
Sarpa?
- Talpa!

560
01:11:20,429 --> 01:11:21,465
Tal-pa.

561
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:23,621
How do you say it?

562
01:11:33,032 --> 01:11:36,242
Lucio Talpa is the name of this guy.

563
01:11:37,131 --> 01:11:38,674
On Lucio Talpa.

564
01:11:38,896 --> 01:11:42,308
Lucio Talpa is the name of a person.

565
01:11:43,323 --> 01:11:45,936
Lucio Talpa is the name of a person.

566
01:11:46,931 --> 01:11:48,282
As you're Maria,

567
01:11:48,426 --> 01:11:51,211
his name is Lucio Talpa.
- Ah! I got it.

568
01:11:53,344 --> 01:11:56,696
He's saying: "How's the relationship
with Lucio Talpa?".

569
01:12:03,671 --> 01:12:05,388
Then, what does it say?

570
01:12:28,658 --> 01:12:29,758
Here you go!

571
01:12:30,081 --> 01:12:31,752
See, what does it take?

572
01:12:31,932 --> 01:12:33,262
You slice it.

573
01:12:35,363 --> 01:12:36,664
This is for you.

574
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:40,000
Thanks.
- The small one is for me.

575
01:12:40,187 --> 01:12:41,247
Small?

576
01:12:42,687 --> 01:12:44,838
Who divides gets the better part!

577
01:12:47,306 --> 01:12:48,367
Here.

578
01:12:49,275 --> 01:12:52,076
And then still,
melon must be eaten this way.

579
01:12:53,224 --> 01:12:54,474
Look, this way!

580
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:56,575
Like watermelon?

581
01:12:59,029 --> 01:13:00,090
Tasty?

582
01:13:02,382 --> 01:13:04,333
All good Italian stuff.

583
01:13:10,999 --> 01:13:12,799
Lover, it's the climate!

584
01:13:13,997 --> 01:13:16,726
Sun, air, everything... the soil!

585
01:13:18,081 --> 01:13:19,831
They make the good stuff.

586
01:13:20,476 --> 01:13:22,568
Ukraine as well is beautiful.

587
01:14:20,496 --> 01:14:24,519
I told you, you worry more than
me who am the affected party.

588
01:14:24,786 --> 01:14:26,437
There's just no reason.

589
01:14:29,769 --> 01:14:32,112
Because so you only live with concern,

590
01:14:32,182 --> 01:14:35,784
in fact, if it isn't fate that
I find this person, or anyone...

591
01:14:35,854 --> 01:14:39,612
And then no way! Nowadays,
it doesn't exist, a single person!

592
01:14:39,681 --> 01:14:40,846
If it's not fate...

593
01:14:40,917 --> 01:14:44,281
If it's fate that I find the
man of my life when I'm 50,

594
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:47,768
it's useless that you worry.
So it is written, and thus it will be.

595
01:14:47,838 --> 01:14:51,338
You can buck all you want,
but it won't be of any help.

596
01:14:52,388 --> 01:14:55,376
Ugh, I'll have to stay close behind you?

597
01:14:55,551 --> 01:14:56,600
Look...

598
01:14:56,728 --> 01:15:00,798
I do not intend to proceed
for another 50 years.

599
01:15:01,039 --> 01:15:02,522
So, at some point,

600
01:15:02,772 --> 01:15:04,830
I'll take leave from life

601
01:15:05,042 --> 01:15:06,696
and, at this point,

602
01:15:06,937 --> 01:15:08,851
I realise one thing:

603
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:12,401
I'll have to stay on your heels
for who knows how long.

604
01:15:13,035 --> 01:15:15,836
Thanks for your trust!
- As sheer spirit!

605
01:15:17,230 --> 01:15:18,994
Or something similar.

606
01:15:19,064 --> 01:15:21,600
Look, why, instead of...
- As a ghost!

607
01:15:21,670 --> 01:15:26,028
Instead of speaking like a 19th century
father, why don't you go to sleep?

608
01:15:29,410 --> 01:15:32,601
Huh? Get going!
Have you brushed your little teeth?

609
01:15:33,108 --> 01:15:34,120
Almost...

610
01:15:38,321 --> 01:15:39,922
What must I hear?

611
01:15:40,756 --> 01:15:44,361
At this hour of night.
- What "hour of night"!

612
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:48,226
You must take the pill.

613
01:15:49,736 --> 01:15:51,048
In 10 minutes.

614
01:15:51,501 --> 01:15:52,918
Ah, well, then!

615
01:16:09,618 --> 01:16:10,948
Oh, alright!

616
01:16:12,774 --> 01:16:15,636
Let's take even the pill.
- Resign yourself.

617
01:16:15,867 --> 01:16:18,768
What do you mean by
"let's take even the pill"?

618
01:16:18,969 --> 01:16:22,913
"Let's take the pill"!
Otherwise I'll make you take it by force.

619
01:16:25,455 --> 01:16:30,043
<i>The government keeps us unaware of the
alien technologies of which it is aware?</i>

620
01:16:30,418 --> 01:16:32,650
<i>I am sure that...</i>

621
01:16:33,199 --> 01:16:34,714
<i>our government</i>

622
01:16:34,784 --> 01:16:37,137
<i>has the tangible evidence,</i>

623
01:16:37,994 --> 01:16:41,040
<i>answers and information about</i>

624
01:16:41,232 --> 01:16:44,588
<i>the existence of the UFOs.</i>

625
01:16:47,849 --> 01:16:51,666
Last night I dreamt a lot
of those "mmh mmh"...

626
01:16:53,511 --> 01:16:55,262
What do I do, I turn off?

627
01:16:55,787 --> 01:16:57,369
What?
- I turn off?

628
01:16:57,439 --> 01:17:01,437
Yes, turn off if it doesn't bother you
reading... looking just at the...

629
01:17:01,506 --> 01:17:04,156
If only I manage to guess the right one...

630
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:10,574
I was practically immersed
in an ocean of...

631
01:17:10,980 --> 01:17:12,857
Made out...
of...

632
01:17:12,927 --> 01:17:14,291
Cow!

633
01:17:16,330 --> 01:17:17,718
It brings money!

634
01:17:18,516 --> 01:17:19,661
Money?

635
01:17:19,731 --> 01:17:23,863
Well, it must be plenty of it then,
because it was just absurd.

636
01:17:23,933 --> 01:17:26,655
Let's hope so! I need a new computer.

637
01:17:27,049 --> 01:17:28,998
At least that!

638
01:17:33,726 --> 01:17:35,475
Good night little flower!

639
01:17:36,304 --> 01:17:37,713
Thank you darling.

640
01:17:38,847 --> 01:17:42,780
Cinderella and the prince,
danced together all night long.

641
01:17:43,618 --> 01:17:44,785
Until when

642
01:17:44,958 --> 01:17:46,763
the clock of the castle

643
01:17:46,985 --> 01:17:51,854
began to strike the first
of the 12 chimes of midnight.

644
01:17:56,509 --> 01:17:59,042
<i>Oh! It's late! I must go!</i>

645
01:17:59,113 --> 01:18:01,095
<i>Wait, don't run away!</i>

646
01:18:02,204 --> 01:18:04,897
The prince tried to run after her,

647
01:18:05,215 --> 01:18:07,773
but the only thing he managed to recover

648
01:18:07,930 --> 01:18:11,776
was a shoe,
which the girl had lost in her run.

649
01:18:11,930 --> 01:18:15,608
Let's go away!
I've never been so offended!

650
01:18:15,678 --> 01:18:16,983
True!

651
01:18:17,138 --> 01:18:19,432
Hey! You forgot this!

652
01:19:45,088 --> 01:19:46,448
In the end...

653
01:19:48,257 --> 01:19:52,144
What's this thing here? - You want it?
I'll bring a uniform for you.

654
01:19:53,458 --> 01:19:55,468
Where will you use it?
In the ambulance?

655
01:19:55,538 --> 01:19:58,066
Yes. - But can you drive?
- I'm well.

656
01:19:58,567 --> 01:20:02,298
Sure you're fine! - I'm well.
- Gimme your hand. - I'm fine, I'm fine.

657
01:20:02,368 --> 01:20:03,669
Such fine hands!

658
01:20:07,716 --> 01:20:09,467
Did you sleep last night?

659
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:13,202
Really?

660
01:20:13,655 --> 01:20:15,205
Are you telling lies?

661
01:20:16,150 --> 01:20:17,258
Come on!

662
01:20:17,495 --> 01:20:18,796
Give me a smile!

663
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:29,389
Always mending.

664
01:20:32,705 --> 01:20:35,389
Luckily there's mum who mends my uniform!

665
01:20:36,278 --> 01:20:37,511
Mum Minica.

666
01:20:37,724 --> 01:20:39,024
Where is Minica?

667
01:20:40,695 --> 01:20:42,515
You want to turn it over?

668
01:20:43,317 --> 01:20:48,398
No, this can't go more than that!
It's short. Let's do this way, good.

669
01:20:50,885 --> 01:20:52,572
You're sleepy, right?

670
01:20:53,822 --> 01:20:54,960
Wanna sleep?

671
01:20:56,050 --> 01:20:57,120
My love!

672
01:20:58,652 --> 01:20:59,665
Mum...

673
01:21:00,061 --> 01:21:01,207
Wanna sleep?

674
01:21:03,927 --> 01:21:05,477
Do you want to sleep?

675
01:21:06,385 --> 01:21:08,185
Come, I'll put you to bed.

676
01:21:09,451 --> 01:21:10,503
No?

677
01:21:11,869 --> 01:21:13,869
You tell me what you wanna do.

678
01:21:16,961 --> 01:21:19,097
What am I to do?
- You tell me.

679
01:21:19,167 --> 01:21:22,301
To Dad. I must go to dad.

680
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:25,882
To Dad. - To Dad?
- That's what I want.

681
01:21:25,952 --> 01:21:28,003
I know.
- You should tell him.

682
01:21:28,092 --> 01:21:29,292
I'll tell him.

683
01:21:29,728 --> 01:21:32,939
What am I to do here? More...

684
01:21:36,896 --> 01:21:40,163
You can't handle these buttons, Mummy.
They're tough.

685
01:21:44,286 --> 01:21:48,565
How you run, oh! - Here you go, here!
- Yes, go easy. - Here!

686
01:21:55,325 --> 01:21:58,175
What beautiful skin you have!
You are a queen!

687
01:22:01,084 --> 01:22:02,192
A queen!

688
01:22:06,557 --> 01:22:07,957
What's the matter?

689
01:22:08,577 --> 01:22:09,927
Are you pensive?

690
01:22:10,805 --> 01:22:13,736
What thoughts do you have?
Wanna tell me about it?

691
01:22:19,056 --> 01:22:20,657
What will be, will be?

692
01:22:21,225 --> 01:22:22,931
And oh well, of course!

693
01:22:25,236 --> 01:22:26,286
Right?

694
01:22:39,730 --> 01:22:40,828
Alright...

695
01:22:47,668 --> 01:22:48,796
Love bean...

696
01:22:48,964 --> 01:22:50,264
I'll be going now.

697
01:22:50,334 --> 01:22:51,735
I'm going to work.

698
01:22:55,435 --> 01:22:56,473
Come on.

699
01:22:56,544 --> 01:22:58,356
Will you give me a kiss?

700
01:23:00,145 --> 01:23:01,796
Will you give me a kiss?

701
01:23:02,332 --> 01:23:04,122
Shall I go without a kiss?

702
01:23:04,192 --> 01:23:06,492
Yes, kisses, kisses.
- Yes, a kiss.

703
01:23:06,678 --> 01:23:08,663
Kisses!
- Won't you give me one?

704
01:23:08,733 --> 01:23:11,659
Kisses!
- Then, I'll give it to you. - Kisses!

705
01:23:13,595 --> 01:23:15,753
Where you going? Where you going?

706
01:23:16,083 --> 01:23:17,791
Where you going?
- To work.

707
01:23:17,861 --> 01:23:19,806
Put yourself down! Put yourself down!

708
01:23:19,876 --> 01:23:23,772
I don't gotta go to work? - Yes,
put yourself down! - Put myself down?

709
01:23:23,842 --> 01:23:27,111
I gotta put myself up, not down.
- Stay down, stay down.

710
01:23:27,181 --> 01:23:31,187
Put yourself down! Put yourself down!
Pootchy pootcha patcho...

711
01:23:58,974 --> 01:24:00,247
The palm tree...

712
01:24:04,307 --> 01:24:06,364
Cannot defend itself.

713
01:24:08,053 --> 01:24:10,203
They've attacked it to the heart.

714
01:24:16,879 --> 01:24:18,335
They're hundreds

715
01:24:19,299 --> 01:24:20,809
and hundreds

716
01:24:21,909 --> 01:24:23,718
of mouths gnawing...

717
01:24:28,062 --> 01:24:29,182
sucking...

718
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:33,194
ravaging.

719
01:24:42,768 --> 01:24:44,768
It's the sound of the orgy.

720
01:24:46,364 --> 01:24:48,064
It's the shameful meal!

721
01:24:51,722 --> 01:24:53,043
We are not...

722
01:24:54,112 --> 01:24:56,535
Sufficiently organised...

723
01:24:57,562 --> 01:24:59,389
To fight...

724
01:25:00,270 --> 01:25:02,268
Against such an organisation.

725
01:25:07,287 --> 01:25:09,505
They speak among themselves.

726
01:25:14,658 --> 01:25:16,104
Such a chatter...

727
01:25:20,534 --> 01:25:22,135
Does have a meaning...

728
01:25:29,238 --> 01:25:31,912
although it's a devastating meaning.

729
01:25:48,557 --> 01:25:50,108
It's not different...

730
01:25:50,930 --> 01:25:53,581
From the chatter of humans
in restaurants.

731
01:26:52,315 --> 01:26:53,816
No, my dear friends.

732
01:26:54,938 --> 01:26:57,648
This meal will cost you dearly, eh!

733
01:27:02,945 --> 01:27:05,945
I'll make them stick in your gullet,
these palms.

734
01:27:12,201 --> 01:27:13,952
It is possible that...

735
01:27:14,571 --> 01:27:17,005
if the intensity is remarkable...

736
01:27:18,825 --> 01:27:21,163
I'll even make them burst, eh?

737
01:28:57,925 --> 01:29:02,158
