1
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,405
Darling, come back to bed.

2
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:58,907
Please. Enough.

3
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:29,038
Enrico, what kind of art dealer
specializes in Nazi art?

4
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:37,630
You Americans love work
more than you love 'love. '

5
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,719
My love, are you ignoring me?

6
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:52,020
Enrico, you said
you only needed ten minutes.

7
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,819
The world is still here.

8
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,905
You and I are still here.

9
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,301
Yes, I love you to death.

10
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:52,231
Why don't they shut her up?

11
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,066
What is she saying?

12
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,153
Berlin can afford to pipe
that garbage all the way here

13
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,238
but can't give us potato soup.

14
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,368
Individual guns only, on my command.

15
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:09,582
We have enough ammo for an hour,
maybe two.

16
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,386
- You got any more biscuits?
- No.

17
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:47,513
- Or anything else?
- Not for you.

18
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:49,598
I'll give you money
for a vitamin biscuit.

19
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,309
Go over and beg the Blacks.

20
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:56,272
What about you? You a replacement?

21
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,025
65th Army Corps.

22
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,777
I thought they were freezing
their asses off in Russia.

23
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:03,446
- So?
- You got any biscuits?

24
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,613
No.

25
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,949
They must have given you something.

26
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,659
If I die, you can have all my rations,

27
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,036
but for now, shut the fuck up!

28
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,955
I got a hole in my stomach.

29
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:21,047
I can't hear a thing
over that damn whore's prattling.

30
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,179
Stupid white man.

31
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,295
Arturo!

32
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,298
Arturo, where are you?

33
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:33,617
Beautiful.

34
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,702
Where did you find it?

35
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:44,002
Watch me throw it.

36
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,882
Little black face,

37
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,884
Beautiful Abyssinian,

38
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:54,513
Wait and hope,
The hour is already near,

39
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,306
When we wiLL be,

40
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,225
Close to you,

41
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:01,436
And there to give you
a different Law and a different King.

42
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:10,112
Arturo! Now, L am nine years old.

43
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:41,685
Okay, maybe I'm eight.
I'm really only eight.

44
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:08,295
A Chocolate Giant.

45
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:13,633
Help me.

46
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,678
I'll give you a banana, Chocolate Giant.

47
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:27,397
Use your tail, Chocolate Giant.

48
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:44,039
No, please don't leave.

49
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,708
Oh, my God, it hurts.

50
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,918
Giant, you don't taste like chocolate.

51
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,359
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

52
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:25,677
Holy Mother of God.

53
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:35,455
This shit is heavy as hell.

54
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,828
To hell with this.

55
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:16,621
I'm up shit's creek.

56
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,518
Eat.

57
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:29,707
Water.

58
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:34,921
Arturo?

59
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:38,216
Can I ask you something?

60
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,678
Can you tell me who I am?

61
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,248
My God, I've had it.

62
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:23,793
Come on, it's enough.

63
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:25,836
Yeah, let's go.

64
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,215
I need something to eat.

65
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:34,637
The Germans are leaving!

66
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:48,025
Push it up or I'll kill it right now.

67
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:49,276
I'm pushing as hard as I can.

68
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:51,779
Pull, pull, pull.

69
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,364
My goodness I'm hungry.

70
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:58,911
Finally something to chew on,
rather than the slime they feed us.

71
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:05,167
Goodbye meat.
Now there'll be nothing left.

72
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,253
They won't get fat on it.

73
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,213
Let's hope they choke on it.

74
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:11,382
Shut up, the two of you!

75
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:15,052
Now, let's see if your husband
will come back from Russia.

76
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,520
Mary, Joseph, Jesus,

77
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:26,897
tell us ifwe'll see him
or never see him again.

78
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:28,566
Is he still alive?

79
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,234
My eyes aren't what they used to be.

80
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:32,611
Come on!

81
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,155
So, so, so?

82
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:37,616
We can't even joke? Come on.

83
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,078
That thing is just a stupid kid's game.

84
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:42,913
You're the usual scoundrel!

85
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:45,583
Just because he carries
the Fascist Party card,

86
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:46,625
he thinks he can do what he wants.

87
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:47,877
Oh yes?

88
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:50,504
Then who was it who took butter
from the Germans the other day?

89
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:52,757
The Pope?

90
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:54,425
Maybe, because it wasn't us.

91
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:55,843
And the light?

92
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:57,636
How did your electricity come back on?

93
00:50:57,804 --> 00:50:58,637
Papa.

94
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:00,848
Come with me.

95
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,726
How did the light come back on?

96
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:06,604
The truth will never
come out of his mouth.

97
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:18,240
You would think that
after all these years,

98
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:20,910
you would treat your friends better.

99
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:22,703
What is wrong with you, Papa?

100
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:24,455
Would you tell me?

101
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,628
It's Natalina.

102
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:32,088
What did she do?

103
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:33,964
She put the evil eye on me, that Witch.

104
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:36,342
You still going on about the same story?

105
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:39,637
The Germans stole your rabbits, not her.

106
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:43,808
There's strange things going on.

107
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:45,643
My electricity returned...

108
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:48,479
from God knows where
after two and a half years.

109
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:50,147
I was going to ask you about that.

110
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:53,901
Now I'm lit up like a carnival...

111
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:56,904
for every bandit and German to see.

112
00:51:57,781 --> 00:52:01,367
It's Natalina's fault. She wants to see
me dead and buried behind the Church.

113
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:02,827
What are you talking about?

114
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:06,372
She prays for you every day.

115
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:09,792
Know what I say?

116
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:15,506
You go back in there
and apologize to your friends.

117
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:18,467
Tell everyone
that Mussolini disgusts you,

118
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:20,761
and that you are not a Fascist anymore.

119
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:24,849
Il Duce made us a world power again.

120
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:28,310
His only mistake was to get in bed
with that imbecile Hitler.

121
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:30,688
Papa, Il Duce betrayed Italy.

122
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:33,190
And now you'll see
how this is going to end.

123
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:36,026
You are still so young, my child.

124
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,987
You don't know the ways of the world.

125
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:40,156
But you will learn.

126
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:41,532
And from whom?

127
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:44,034
From a Fascist like you?

128
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:47,163
You're just like your mother.

129
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:48,914
And she used to tell you
that Blackshirts

130
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,875
are only good for hiding dirt.

131
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:52,042
Okay, let's go.

132
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:00,593
Germans!

133
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:03,387
It's your house.

134
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:15,399
Holy Mother of God.

135
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:25,242
It's okay.

136
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:27,244
It's okay, it's okay.

137
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:38,672
Americans?

138
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:42,009
Half.

139
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:44,261
Me sister Ida, half.

140
00:53:45,263 --> 00:53:47,932
We called her little Ida,
because she was the baby.

141
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:50,267
Put us together, we make one American.

142
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:51,477
Okay, wait. Wait.

143
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:53,938
Wait. Wait. Wait.

144
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:55,356
Thank you.

145
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:57,191
Who's in charge here?

146
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:15,334
Where are the Germans?

147
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:42,736
A boy? He has a boy.

148
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:46,448
Oh, my God.

149
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:48,951
Is he alive?
Put him here.

150
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:51,161
Slow. Slowly.

151
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:54,790
Where did you find him?

152
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:55,833
On the Mountain.

153
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:57,209
Do you know him?

154
00:54:57,335 --> 00:54:59,336
No, I don't know him.

155
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:01,839
But he can stay here
until he gets better.

156
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:11,140
We're going to a hospital.
You can come with us.

157
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:13,726
The hospital around the corner?

158
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:16,061
The Germans are everywhere.

159
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:18,188
Torrite, Rontano, Mezzana.

160
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:20,441
All the way to Barga
and down to the Serchio.

161
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,694
I don't know how you got past Vergemoli.

162
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:27,406
The only way to Pietrasanta...

163
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:29,158
where the Americans might be...

164
00:55:29,242 --> 00:55:30,909
is over that way,

165
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,704
over the Mountain of the Sleeping Man.

166
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,090
What is that?

167
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:47,509
It's a legend.

168
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:53,766
A shepherd fell in love with a girl
who would not love him back.

169
00:55:53,975 --> 00:55:56,226
So he lays across the Mountain...

170
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:58,687
to protect her from the wind and rain.

171
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:02,483
He still lies there today,
to protect us all.

172
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:07,321
Legend has it that one day
he will awaken.

173
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:36,433
We should take him...

174
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:38,644
and put him to bed.

175
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:32,781
Catching up on your reading?

176
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:35,909
Yes, Colonel,
I'm informing myself about the enemy.

177
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:40,330
The Partisans often take their names
from banned poetry and literature.

178
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,291
This helps us identify them.

179
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:44,001
Who is the poet?

180
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:46,003
Giovanni Pascoli.

181
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:51,842
Do you think it's appropriate to waste
your time reading poetry?

182
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:57,681
In the past nine months we've seen
a sharp rise in Partisan activity.

183
00:57:57,807 --> 00:58:00,100
What are you planning to do about it?

184
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:04,146
Colonel, we are down
to shovels and mule shit.

185
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:05,647
My men are exhausted.

186
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:07,858
We need ammo and food.

187
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:10,444
Food? You want food?

188
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:13,280
You can suck icicles in Russia...

189
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:18,410
like you did before your so-called
neck wound brought you back here.

190
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:21,330
You think you're the first
to command hungry troops?

191
00:58:22,373 --> 00:58:25,459
I mean no disrespect, Colonel.

192
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:29,963
Good. Listen closely.

193
00:58:30,548 --> 00:58:33,133
I have come too far to repeat myself.

194
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:37,679
First, there is a peasant, a terrorist.

195
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:42,392
Named The Great Butterfly.
He's causing many problems.

196
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:45,062
He's hiding in these mountains.
Find him.

197
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:48,440
When he is found,
issue Directive Bandenbefehl...

198
00:58:48,566 --> 00:58:51,068
to him and his criminal friends.

199
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:52,069
Bandenbefehl?

200
00:58:52,153 --> 00:58:54,488
Is there an echo out here?

201
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:59,034
General Kesselring's standing field
order for the Italian Republic.

202
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:01,578
At a commander's sole discretion,

203
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:04,414
for every one German soldier killed,

204
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:06,792
we execute ten Ltalian civilians.

205
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:12,381
You should have been capable to execute
that order at least once in nine months.

206
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:16,051
Colonel, with all due respect,
if I execute this order...

207
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:18,595
my men would kill innocent civilians.

208
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:21,848
It would be a violation
of the Geneva Convention.

209
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:27,104
Partisans are not civilians;
they are terrorists.

210
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:30,065
They are not protected
under the Geneva Convention.

211
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:31,942
Bandenbefehl!

212
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:33,652
Bandenbefehl.

213
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:39,366
Secondly, the surprise
counterattack is still planned.

214
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:43,912
I will tighten supply lines
with food and ammunition.

215
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:45,122
And three:

216
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:50,127
A delicate intelligence matter
of the utmost priority.

217
00:59:56,175 --> 00:59:58,844
We are missing a Corporal...

218
00:59:59,053 --> 01:00:02,639
from the 35th Regiment,
2nd Battalion, 5th Company.

219
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:06,643
Name; Hans Brandt,
gone AWOL three weeks ago.

220
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:09,730
We have some every day.
What's so special about him?

221
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:13,066
You and I are not here...

222
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:16,820
to question the Fuhrer's orders.

223
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:19,323
You are to send out a search party.

224
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:21,158
Find him.

225
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:22,826
Don't let him escape.

226
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:25,078
And when you have him...

227
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:28,749
get word to me immediately.

228
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:39,635
Let's go!

229
01:00:50,688 --> 01:00:53,732
If I am no Longer that Lamp...

230
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:57,110
which flickers in front
of a sweet Maria.

231
01:00:57,362 --> 01:00:58,528
What does that mean?

232
01:00:59,864 --> 01:01:01,573
God help this poor bastard Brandt.

233
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:03,867
Whatever he's done,

234
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:06,745
it's no worse than what anyone else
has done in this war.

235
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:08,872
Mount a search party.

236
01:01:08,956 --> 01:01:10,874
We have to find him first,

237
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,543
hold him and give him a few days...

238
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:17,255
before Pflueger pulls out his teeth,
one by one.

239
01:01:17,382 --> 01:01:18,215
Yes.

240
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:20,676
I'll be relieved when this war is over.

241
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:22,844
I want to return to my family.

242
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:54,084
I've watched you grow up.

243
01:01:54,168 --> 01:01:56,378
But you haven't become much.

244
01:01:56,462 --> 01:01:57,587
And he can't do much.

245
01:01:57,964 --> 01:01:58,964
You're laughing at me?

246
01:01:59,090 --> 01:01:59,756
Of course.

247
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:01,758
Where did you get that?

248
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:03,802
So many things you want to know.

249
01:02:03,928 --> 01:02:04,928
Here. Take it and eat.

250
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:06,304
Give me some, too.

251
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:08,348
Are you afraid you're not
going to get any?

252
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:09,641
Here. Grow.

253
01:02:09,767 --> 01:02:11,393
Give me a chestnut, too.

254
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:14,730
My goodness, you stink like a sheep.

255
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:16,231
Hey, leave me alone.

256
01:02:16,774 --> 01:02:18,275
Aren't you the dandy?

257
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:20,444
Ah, he's offended.

258
01:02:25,867 --> 01:02:28,452
What the fuck are you doing, Peppi?

259
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,162
You have to be on the lookout.

260
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:33,457
If I had been a German,
you would all be dead... 1, 2, 3.

261
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,125
I almost choked.

262
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:37,794
You wait here.

263
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:54,102
My friend.

264
01:02:54,353 --> 01:02:56,563
The Americans are getting closer.

265
01:02:57,648 --> 01:02:59,816
We have to warn them about
the Germans' counterattack.

266
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:01,985
They know it already, for sure.

267
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:04,821
You? How are you?

268
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:06,698
Me? I'm okay.

269
01:03:08,075 --> 01:03:08,492
You?

270
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:10,994
I always have Marco's face
in front of my eyes.

271
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:15,624
Don't worry about that.

272
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:20,587
My brother is dead.
Nobody cares about him any more.

273
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:22,047
I care.

274
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:23,548
In your opinion...

275
01:03:24,383 --> 01:03:25,801
when we will be in front of God,

276
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:27,844
ifwe ever get there,

277
01:03:28,721 --> 01:03:31,640
is he going to ask us
for our political card?

278
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:33,517
Is he going to say, "Marco, no...

279
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:34,643
Ludovico, no.

280
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:37,062
You're not allowed in
because you're Fascists. "

281
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:42,818
What's the difference between
us and them in the eyes of God?

282
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:45,153
You're asking yourself
too many questions.

283
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:48,365
If you think too much,
it will drive you crazy.

284
01:03:48,866 --> 01:03:50,867
And then who will kill the Germans?

285
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:52,452
Hey.

286
01:03:54,747 --> 01:03:57,082
Anyway, what's done is done.

287
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:42,752
Someone tell that big beast
to get out of my room.

288
01:04:43,796 --> 01:04:45,255
The Boy has a fever.

289
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:47,757
He needs to eat and get some rest.

290
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:50,468
Try thinking of others
every once in awhile.

291
01:05:00,479 --> 01:05:01,688
Arturo.

292
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:05,233
The Chocolate Giant's Castle...

293
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:07,110
if you could only see it.

294
01:05:07,194 --> 01:05:08,987
It's enormous.

295
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,823
No, even bigger.

296
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:14,784
Of course I saw it.

297
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:17,454
It's all made of chocolate.

298
01:05:17,538 --> 01:05:19,414
You break a piece off,

299
01:05:19,498 --> 01:05:21,249
and it grows back.

300
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:25,629
Yes, I did save a piece for you.

301
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:34,512
Good heavens.

302
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:36,139
Something's not right.

303
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:37,641
Someone put the evil eye on him.

304
01:05:37,725 --> 01:05:39,726
Bewitched or not, he's got to go.

305
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:40,810
To where?

306
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:42,437
With the Americans.

307
01:05:42,897 --> 01:05:44,522
I think he brings good luck.
The Boy stays.

308
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:46,149
This is my house.

309
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:47,567
I have a house too.

310
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:49,527
Natalina.

311
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:51,154
What do you think?

312
01:05:51,572 --> 01:05:53,823
I say this Boy is talking to the Devil.

313
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:55,784
We need a Priest here.

314
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:58,036
He doesn't need a Priest.
He needs a Doctor.

315
01:05:58,162 --> 01:06:01,289
A Driest can take the Devil out of him.

316
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:54,384
My Chocolate Giant.

317
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:51,900
Can you show us a safe path?

318
01:07:52,526 --> 01:07:54,277
There is no safe way.

319
01:07:54,445 --> 01:07:55,987
Germans. Boom! Boom!

320
01:07:56,113 --> 01:07:57,614
You know a way.

321
01:07:57,698 --> 01:08:00,825
Franco was the mailman, ask him.
I'm too old.

322
01:08:00,951 --> 01:08:01,659
Me?

323
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:04,037
I have to deliver the mail.

324
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:06,331
What mail, you old crazy fool?

325
01:08:06,457 --> 01:08:10,126
Old crazy fool? You're the old crazy,
like your mother and your father.

326
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:16,841
What did you say?

327
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:21,304
What did my daughter say?

328
01:08:21,889 --> 01:08:23,389
I have nothing to do with this.

329
01:09:01,929 --> 01:09:03,346
Are you crazy in the head?

330
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:04,806
Keep out of this.

331
01:09:05,724 --> 01:09:07,183
I forbid you to go.

332
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:09,686
I don't need your permission.
Understand?

333
01:09:10,521 --> 01:09:12,564
You're still my daughter.

334
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:33,084
Renata. Come away.

335
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:47,515
Shove it up your ass.

336
01:10:02,948 --> 01:10:06,576
Arturo said that
if you turn your head...

337
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:08,286
it will be my birthday.

338
01:10:08,621 --> 01:10:11,581
I'll get toys and lots of candy.

339
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:14,709
Now, please turn your head.

340
01:10:15,753 --> 01:10:17,670
Please turn your head.

341
01:10:57,169 --> 01:10:58,836
Can you turn your head like this?

342
01:10:58,963 --> 01:10:59,921
See?

343
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:27,365
Listen, Chocolate Giant.

344
01:11:27,491 --> 01:11:29,325
You've got to do what I say.

345
01:11:29,451 --> 01:11:32,203
Turn your head
so it will be my birthday.

346
01:11:32,329 --> 01:11:34,414
You want me to stay eight forever?

347
01:11:36,041 --> 01:11:37,333
Turn your head.

348
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:43,214
Yes! I did it!

349
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:44,841
I'm nine years old!

350
01:11:47,678 --> 01:11:49,304
Nine years old!

351
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:51,347
Hurray!

352
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:52,515
Nine years old!

353
01:11:54,351 --> 01:11:55,393
I did it!

354
01:11:55,519 --> 01:11:56,894
Nine years old!

355
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:16,432
How do you know?

356
01:13:16,975 --> 01:13:18,101
Is that true?

357
01:13:19,269 --> 01:13:21,270
Yeah, I know.

358
01:13:21,355 --> 01:13:22,605
Who are you talking to?

359
01:13:22,731 --> 01:13:23,481
To Arturo.

360
01:13:24,983 --> 01:13:25,817
Who's Arturo?

361
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:27,193
My friend.

362
01:13:29,279 --> 01:13:30,613
And where is he?

363
01:13:31,949 --> 01:13:33,699
Over there, do you see?

364
01:13:33,992 --> 01:13:35,993
He's shy in front of other people.

365
01:14:16,034 --> 01:14:17,660
Arturo, what do you think?

366
01:14:18,328 --> 01:14:19,704
Shall we help him?

367
01:14:23,167 --> 01:14:23,833
We did it.

368
01:17:58,590 --> 01:17:59,882
Soon we'll be going back home.

369
01:17:59,966 --> 01:18:01,425
Nobody believes that.

370
01:18:01,551 --> 01:18:05,054
He just wants to visit his girlfriend.

371
01:25:33,169 --> 01:25:34,753
Good. Good.

372
01:28:46,904 --> 01:28:47,446
Hector.

373
01:28:47,864 --> 01:28:48,530
Come?

374
01:28:55,163 --> 01:28:55,912
Thank you.

375
01:28:57,915 --> 01:28:59,374
- Wine?
- Certainly.

376
01:30:20,998 --> 01:30:21,998
Who are you?

377
01:30:22,125 --> 01:30:23,125
Who the fuck are you?

378
01:30:23,209 --> 01:30:24,000
Partisans?

379
01:30:24,168 --> 01:30:25,252
Who are you?

380
01:30:25,336 --> 01:30:26,378
Partisans?

381
01:30:30,842 --> 01:30:32,467
Come here! Come here!

382
01:30:40,059 --> 01:30:41,309
Bastard!

383
01:30:41,561 --> 01:30:42,727
Go! Go!

384
01:30:45,857 --> 01:30:47,607
Fucking swine! Go!

385
01:31:03,124 --> 01:31:04,875
- It's him, isn't it?
- Yes!

386
01:31:05,001 --> 01:31:06,418
I knew he'd come back.

387
01:31:09,672 --> 01:31:10,380
Everything's okay.

388
01:31:10,506 --> 01:31:11,548
Tell them to put down their arms.

389
01:31:14,969 --> 01:31:15,802
Americans?

390
01:31:15,887 --> 01:31:16,720
Yes.

391
01:31:26,772 --> 01:31:27,439
Here's some bread.

392
01:31:33,321 --> 01:31:34,738
Thank you.

393
01:31:37,408 --> 01:31:37,949
Peppi.

394
01:31:39,076 --> 01:31:39,743
Gianni.

395
01:31:41,954 --> 01:31:42,537
Italo.

396
01:31:45,917 --> 01:31:47,125
Your documents.

397
01:31:51,714 --> 01:31:52,422
Read this.

398
01:33:01,450 --> 01:33:02,284
What are they saying?

399
01:33:02,368 --> 01:33:04,953
Those two have been fighting
since they got here.

400
01:33:05,079 --> 01:33:05,620
They want the German.

401
01:33:05,746 --> 01:33:08,373
We're holding the German, he's ours.

402
01:33:09,417 --> 01:33:12,252
We'll interrogate him once we
find someone who speaks German.

403
01:33:21,178 --> 01:33:24,431
At headquarters a lot of people
speak German. Let's go.

404
01:33:24,515 --> 01:33:26,933
First, we ask him questions.

405
01:33:27,018 --> 01:33:28,643
Then we'll turn him over.

406
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:01,259
You're alive.

407
01:34:01,719 --> 01:34:04,387
I told you to run and you made it.

408
01:34:06,849 --> 01:34:09,017
Such a good Boy.

409
01:34:09,769 --> 01:34:11,436
Such a good, clever Boy.

410
01:34:13,356 --> 01:34:15,357
Just like my little brother, Ulrich.

411
01:34:16,567 --> 01:34:18,943
You even have the same hair.

412
01:34:20,529 --> 01:34:22,781
You have to listen little brother.

413
01:34:23,741 --> 01:34:24,866
Listen closely.

414
01:34:26,410 --> 01:34:28,370
You've got to run again.

415
01:34:29,914 --> 01:34:31,206
Get away.

416
01:34:31,290 --> 01:34:32,207
He's talking too much.

417
01:34:32,333 --> 01:34:34,250
I told you we should have killed him.

418
01:34:36,003 --> 01:34:37,545
Do you understand? Run.

419
01:34:37,630 --> 01:34:38,713
Run again.

420
01:34:38,839 --> 01:34:40,048
Run as fast as you can.

421
01:34:40,174 --> 01:34:41,508
Shut up!

422
01:34:57,858 --> 01:34:59,401
So, how did you get lights?

423
01:35:02,238 --> 01:35:03,405
I don't know.

424
01:35:04,865 --> 01:35:06,366
It was a Miracle.

425
01:35:06,784 --> 01:35:09,077
Do you know what the real Miracle is?

426
01:35:09,578 --> 01:35:11,079
Is that you're still alive.

427
01:36:25,988 --> 01:36:27,197
So,

428
01:36:27,823 --> 01:36:29,240
how are you feeling?

429
01:36:29,825 --> 01:36:30,742
Want a chocolate?

430
01:36:32,036 --> 01:36:32,994
It's good.

431
01:36:37,124 --> 01:36:38,666
I need your help.

432
01:36:54,183 --> 01:36:55,099
What's your name?

433
01:36:56,143 --> 01:36:58,561
Angelo. Angelo Torancelli.

434
01:36:59,605 --> 01:37:01,731
Me, I'm Hector.

435
01:37:02,566 --> 01:37:03,483
Where are you from?

436
01:37:04,026 --> 01:37:06,027
From St. Anna di Stazzema.

437
01:37:07,404 --> 01:37:08,780
Angelo...

438
01:37:08,906 --> 01:37:10,490
that German...

439
01:37:10,574 --> 01:37:11,533
do you know him?

440
01:37:12,827 --> 01:37:16,037
Yes. There were a lot of them.

441
01:37:17,248 --> 01:37:19,415
What did he tell you just now?

442
01:37:19,542 --> 01:37:21,835
He told me what he told me before.

443
01:37:22,253 --> 01:37:24,587
He told me to run as fast as I can.

444
01:37:24,755 --> 01:37:25,421
When?

445
01:37:25,756 --> 01:37:29,300
Before. At the fire. At the Church.

446
01:37:31,095 --> 01:37:33,221
What fire?

447
01:37:37,601 --> 01:37:39,394
Your father and your mother...

448
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:41,396
Where is your father and your mother?

449
01:37:58,289 --> 01:37:59,706
Why are you so afraid of him?

450
01:37:59,790 --> 01:38:01,708
I'm not afraid of him.

451
01:38:01,792 --> 01:38:03,251
He's my friend.

452
01:38:03,377 --> 01:38:05,044
I'm afraid of the other one.

453
01:38:05,129 --> 01:38:06,087
What other one?

454
01:38:35,117 --> 01:38:36,117
Murderer!

455
01:38:36,201 --> 01:38:36,826
Nazi! Dirty pig!

456
01:38:36,952 --> 01:38:37,577
Burn in hell!

457
01:38:37,661 --> 01:38:38,995
Send that son of a whore out here!

458
01:38:39,330 --> 01:38:40,830
Get back!

459
01:38:40,956 --> 01:38:42,123
We'll rip his eyes out!

460
01:38:42,499 --> 01:38:43,708
Butterfly!

461
01:38:48,005 --> 01:38:49,130
Who threw that?

462
01:38:52,009 --> 01:38:53,092
Give him to us!

463
01:38:53,177 --> 01:38:54,135
We want him now!

464
01:39:02,519 --> 01:39:03,603
Go, go, go!

465
01:39:04,980 --> 01:39:07,231
You have two days.
No more. Tell them!

466
01:39:09,193 --> 01:39:10,485
He'll stay here.

467
01:39:19,828 --> 01:39:21,412
I need another pair of eyes.

468
01:39:28,045 --> 01:39:30,505
Excuse me.
Can we have a moment?

469
01:40:23,142 --> 01:40:26,019
He wants you to go up the Mountain...

470
01:40:26,103 --> 01:40:27,395
and tell us what you see.

471
01:40:28,147 --> 01:40:28,771
Come on.

472
01:42:04,618 --> 01:42:08,162
G.I. G.I. G.I.

473
01:42:34,982 --> 01:42:35,940
Well?

474
01:42:37,192 --> 01:42:38,192
Is it safe?

475
01:42:39,403 --> 01:42:41,237
Yes, it's safe. Yes.

476
01:42:41,363 --> 01:42:42,363
Good.

477
01:42:46,326 --> 01:42:47,743
Come with me.

478
01:42:48,495 --> 01:42:49,287
Go.

479
01:42:58,172 --> 01:42:59,172
What's that?

480
01:42:59,256 --> 01:43:00,464
I don't understand Spanish.

481
01:43:00,799 --> 01:43:01,924
What is that?

482
01:43:02,843 --> 01:43:03,885
A cigarette.

483
01:43:04,094 --> 01:43:06,262
No, that's not a cigarette.

484
01:43:07,556 --> 01:43:08,890
American cigarettes.

485
01:43:10,726 --> 01:43:11,726
Good.

486
01:43:12,394 --> 01:43:13,561
Very good.

487
01:43:17,441 --> 01:43:18,649
What's your name?

488
01:43:19,610 --> 01:43:20,735
Rodolfo.

489
01:43:28,285 --> 01:43:29,744
God Almighty.

490
01:43:29,870 --> 01:43:32,747
The tree of life blossoms
beside the shore of still waters.

491
01:43:38,212 --> 01:43:40,379
Nor Sun.

492
01:43:40,464 --> 01:43:43,049
There is no suffering in your Kingdom.

493
01:43:43,133 --> 01:43:46,135
And we ask for your forgiveness
merciful Father...

494
01:43:46,261 --> 01:43:48,971
that we have not seen
the light before this day.

495
01:43:49,097 --> 01:43:51,098
For your light reigns forever.

496
01:43:51,225 --> 01:43:53,434
It is a shining beacon that lights
the path to your heavenly throne.

497
01:44:00,108 --> 01:44:01,943
But we are your people.

498
01:44:02,069 --> 01:44:06,614
And we ask you, Lord, to walk
with us in our pain and our suffering.

499
01:44:09,618 --> 01:44:11,118
in victory.

500
01:48:30,253 --> 01:48:31,378
Come in.

501
01:49:15,966 --> 01:49:19,218
You didn't know that the Germans
raised the price on your head.

502
01:49:19,302 --> 01:49:21,595
From 50,000 lire to 100,000 lire...

503
01:49:21,680 --> 01:49:23,097
and a bag of salt.

504
01:49:23,723 --> 01:49:24,515
Not bad!

505
01:49:25,976 --> 01:49:30,688
But you saw, no one
from the village turned you in.

506
01:49:31,982 --> 01:49:33,941
Not even the Fascist Ludovico...

507
01:49:34,818 --> 01:49:37,945
who's so stingy he keeps
his money in his underpants.

508
01:49:38,071 --> 01:49:39,113
Not even Ludovico?

509
01:49:40,323 --> 01:49:41,490
Not even Ludovico.

510
01:49:41,616 --> 01:49:43,284
If they only knew who I am,

511
01:49:44,995 --> 01:49:46,704
what L've done,

512
01:49:49,583 --> 01:49:51,667
they'd pull my heart out of my chest.

513
01:49:52,460 --> 01:49:53,460
Peppi.

514
01:49:56,298 --> 01:49:58,841
What's tormenting you so much?

515
01:49:58,967 --> 01:50:01,010
We surprised a German Patrol...

516
01:50:01,136 --> 01:50:03,971
My little son Robert loves the rain.

517
01:50:04,055 --> 01:50:05,639
My little Anna hates it.

518
01:50:06,016 --> 01:50:07,016
Shut up you two!

519
01:50:07,475 --> 01:50:08,475
Yes, Sir.

520
01:50:17,694 --> 01:50:20,487
Where are you going?

521
01:50:25,035 --> 01:50:26,035
I'll slaughter you.

522
01:50:30,624 --> 01:50:31,582
Do you hear me?

523
01:50:32,125 --> 01:50:34,168
Do you hear me?
I'll slaughter you.

524
01:50:38,048 --> 01:50:40,007
How many times do you want to kill him?

525
01:50:41,635 --> 01:50:43,260
He's already dead.

526
01:50:57,233 --> 01:50:58,442
Look what I found.

527
01:50:59,402 --> 01:51:00,027
Here.

528
01:51:00,487 --> 01:51:02,029
I'll keep this for my family.

529
01:51:02,405 --> 01:51:03,656
My daughter is hungry.

530
01:51:03,740 --> 01:51:05,366
At least L can give her food.

531
01:51:06,034 --> 01:51:06,784
Take this.

532
01:51:09,245 --> 01:51:11,246
This money is stained with blood.

533
01:51:12,499 --> 01:51:14,208
We're suppose to catch the thieves...

534
01:51:14,334 --> 01:51:15,876
not become them.

535
01:51:16,002 --> 01:51:17,878
Let's not start a war between ourselves.

536
01:51:17,962 --> 01:51:19,546
What's that got to do with it?

537
01:51:20,590 --> 01:51:22,091
I gave you three years of blood.

538
01:51:22,217 --> 01:51:23,384
To Italy and to him.

539
01:51:23,468 --> 01:51:24,885
Three years of blood.

540
01:51:25,011 --> 01:51:28,514
You're a Fascist
and you'll always be one, like Marco.

541
01:51:28,598 --> 01:51:29,306
Here.

542
01:51:29,683 --> 01:51:31,058
Take your money and go home.

543
01:51:31,601 --> 01:51:33,435
I will take it home.

544
01:51:36,606 --> 01:51:37,940
I will take it.

545
01:51:38,775 --> 01:51:39,400
Go, go, go.

546
01:51:40,110 --> 01:51:41,360
Go!

547
01:51:54,708 --> 01:51:56,083
It's finished here.

548
01:51:58,962 --> 01:52:01,255
You'll pay for this.

549
01:52:03,717 --> 01:52:05,801
The Germans were blinded by rage.

550
01:52:05,927 --> 01:52:08,929
We had been attacking them for months.
They were furious.

551
01:52:09,889 --> 01:52:12,391
They combed the mountains
looking for us.

552
01:52:12,475 --> 01:52:13,642
We had to hide.

553
01:52:13,768 --> 01:52:14,977
We could have starved to death.

554
01:52:22,402 --> 01:52:23,485
Nobody there.

555
01:52:24,779 --> 01:52:26,530
A fellow Dartisan saved us.

556
01:52:26,948 --> 01:52:28,699
Paselli was her name.

557
01:52:49,679 --> 01:52:52,473
She was the one who told me
what happened at St. Anna di Stazzema.

558
01:52:53,475 --> 01:52:54,141
Eat.

559
01:52:54,517 --> 01:52:55,225
Thank you.

560
01:52:55,810 --> 01:52:57,644
I had sent the others to Serravezza.

561
01:52:57,729 --> 01:53:00,731
I had to meet one of our men
who had gone to look for supplies.

562
01:53:03,526 --> 01:53:05,861
But then, because of the storm,
I had to stay in the mountains.

563
01:53:05,987 --> 01:53:08,363
They marched into St. Anna.

564
01:53:08,698 --> 01:53:11,950
They gathered hundreds of people,

565
01:53:12,035 --> 01:53:12,868
women,

566
01:53:12,994 --> 01:53:13,827
children,

567
01:53:13,912 --> 01:53:15,162
children and old people.

568
01:53:18,124 --> 01:53:19,666
There were also refugees.

569
01:53:19,751 --> 01:53:22,127
They grouped them in the Square.

570
01:53:22,212 --> 01:53:23,545
In front of the Church.

571
01:53:26,508 --> 01:53:28,675
One of you...

572
01:53:30,637 --> 01:53:32,221
knows...

573
01:53:32,347 --> 01:53:33,889
where he is.

574
01:53:36,017 --> 01:53:38,185
One of you...

575
01:53:40,188 --> 01:53:41,104
has seen...

576
01:53:41,898 --> 01:53:42,606
him.

577
01:53:44,734 --> 01:53:45,526
So...

578
01:53:47,737 --> 01:53:49,029
speak.

579
01:53:53,076 --> 01:53:54,576
Everyone's quiet.

580
01:53:59,749 --> 01:54:01,083
They don't know anything.

581
01:54:01,209 --> 01:54:02,417
They're innocent.

582
01:54:02,544 --> 01:54:03,585
They don't know anything.

583
01:54:03,711 --> 01:54:06,088
I gave you fifteen minutes...

584
01:54:06,214 --> 01:54:07,548
They're innocent.

585
01:54:07,674 --> 01:54:11,426
to find someone who would tell us...

586
01:54:11,553 --> 01:54:12,845
They don't know.

587
01:54:12,929 --> 01:54:16,056
where is the hideout of the Butterfly?

588
01:54:16,140 --> 01:54:16,557
They don't know.

589
01:54:16,641 --> 01:54:17,683
And his Bandits.

590
01:54:17,767 --> 01:54:19,393
Take only my life.

591
01:54:19,477 --> 01:54:20,394
I beg you.

592
01:54:20,478 --> 01:54:23,397
You still have one minute.

593
01:54:33,032 --> 01:54:33,740
Kneel.

594
01:54:35,743 --> 01:54:37,411
In the name of the Father...

595
01:54:37,954 --> 01:54:38,912
And the Son...

596
01:54:39,372 --> 01:54:41,081
and the Holy Ghost.

597
01:54:42,959 --> 01:54:45,085
Our Father who art in Heaven,

598
01:54:45,628 --> 01:54:47,754
hallowed be Thy name,

599
01:54:48,214 --> 01:54:49,965
Thy Kingdom come,

600
01:54:50,091 --> 01:54:52,134
Thy will be done,

601
01:54:53,803 --> 01:54:55,137
On Earth...

602
01:54:55,263 --> 01:54:56,763
as it is in Heaven.

603
01:54:57,724 --> 01:55:00,267
Give us this day our daily bread.

604
01:55:01,060 --> 01:55:03,353
Forgive us for our trespasses,

605
01:55:04,063 --> 01:55:06,607
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

606
01:55:07,442 --> 01:55:09,776
Lead us not into temptation.

607
01:55:10,486 --> 01:55:12,487
But deliver us from Evil.

608
01:55:16,409 --> 01:55:17,284
I understand.

609
01:55:17,410 --> 01:55:18,118
Is there something?

610
01:55:18,661 --> 01:55:19,286
Yes, Sir...

611
01:55:19,370 --> 01:55:21,622
There are orders from headquarters.

612
01:55:22,749 --> 01:55:23,498
Yes?

613
01:55:25,752 --> 01:55:26,418
It will be done.

614
01:55:51,361 --> 01:55:51,860
Father.

615
01:55:52,695 --> 01:55:53,779
Forgive them...

616
01:55:53,863 --> 01:55:55,739
for they know not what they do.

617
01:56:54,382 --> 01:56:55,507
They...

618
01:56:55,591 --> 01:56:59,428
killed so many,

619
01:57:00,930 --> 01:57:02,639
that they ran out of ammunition.

620
01:57:27,415 --> 01:57:28,915
They burnt so many...

621
01:57:29,792 --> 01:57:33,003
they ran out of fuel.

622
01:57:36,049 --> 01:57:37,758
What has happened here...

623
01:57:40,928 --> 01:57:43,096
everything that's happened...

624
01:57:44,474 --> 01:57:46,183
is your fault.

625
01:57:46,893 --> 01:57:50,312
You promised to bring The Butterfly.

626
01:57:50,438 --> 01:57:52,439
- He told me he would be here.
- No. No. I don't care!

627
01:57:52,565 --> 01:57:54,191
- I know these people.
- You will pay for this!

628
01:57:54,317 --> 01:57:55,692
They have nothing to do with it.

629
01:57:56,152 --> 01:57:58,403
Rodolfo, we had a deal.

630
01:57:58,488 --> 01:58:00,238
No, I kept my deal.

631
01:58:00,323 --> 01:58:01,948
I brought him here.

632
01:58:02,033 --> 01:58:05,327
But you promised me, my dear Rodolfo.

633
01:58:05,912 --> 01:58:07,412
You Italians don't know
how to keep a deal.

634
01:58:07,497 --> 01:58:10,040
I betrayed my people.
I'll burn in Hell because of you.

635
01:58:10,166 --> 01:58:12,959
You worthless Italians.

636
01:58:13,628 --> 01:58:15,462
You will pay for this!

637
01:58:15,588 --> 01:58:17,255
All of you Ltalians will pay for this!

638
01:58:17,340 --> 01:58:21,468
Mama!

639
01:58:21,844 --> 01:58:23,345
Arturo! Arturo!

640
01:58:23,513 --> 01:58:25,472
No!

641
01:58:25,556 --> 01:58:26,640
Stop! Stop!

642
01:58:26,766 --> 01:58:27,974
Run! Run!

643
01:58:28,142 --> 01:58:30,060
Run!

644
01:58:31,354 --> 01:58:32,312
Child murderer!

645
01:58:41,155 --> 01:58:42,572
Bloody traitor!

646
01:58:44,367 --> 01:58:45,659
Come on!

647
01:58:46,119 --> 01:58:46,827
Move!

648
01:58:47,495 --> 01:58:48,829
Move! Move! Move!

649
01:58:55,837 --> 01:58:57,212
Bring him back!

650
01:58:58,965 --> 01:58:59,673
Go!

651
01:59:07,515 --> 01:59:08,765
Finish him!

652
01:59:09,016 --> 01:59:10,433
Kill him!

653
01:59:14,730 --> 01:59:16,773
Move, move.
We can't go back without him.

654
01:59:20,903 --> 01:59:22,070
Where's that swine?

655
01:59:22,196 --> 01:59:23,113
Over there.

656
01:59:31,038 --> 01:59:33,081
Even if I live a hundred years...

657
01:59:33,207 --> 01:59:34,791
I've been dead from that day on.

658
01:59:35,251 --> 01:59:36,543
Peppi.

659
01:59:39,213 --> 01:59:41,882
You need a lot more courage
to live than to die.

660
01:59:43,217 --> 01:59:46,094
But listen to me.

661
01:59:46,220 --> 01:59:48,388
You have to accept the truth.

662
01:59:48,472 --> 01:59:51,391
Someone betrayed you.

663
01:59:51,517 --> 01:59:54,603
And you have to find the traitor.

664
01:59:56,772 --> 01:59:58,231
Only thing I know...

665
02:00:00,276 --> 02:00:03,737
The Germans were wrong
to provoke The Sleeping Man.

666
02:00:05,448 --> 02:00:07,199
Because, you'll see...

667
02:00:07,283 --> 02:00:08,283
In the end,

668
02:00:08,409 --> 02:00:09,951
he'll protect us.

669
02:00:11,120 --> 02:00:12,746
He'll protect his land.

670
02:00:22,798 --> 02:00:24,299
I'm done.

671
02:00:25,968 --> 02:00:27,802
I shit on Hitler's mother.

672
02:00:32,475 --> 02:00:36,144
If I were in San Juan,
I'd eat a good plate of rice and beans.

673
02:00:36,604 --> 02:00:38,271
And a sweetie pie for dessert.

674
02:00:56,332 --> 02:00:58,333
I'll meet that swine...

675
02:00:58,960 --> 02:01:00,877
in Hell.

676
02:01:35,788 --> 02:01:36,871
Where's the German?

677
02:01:37,373 --> 02:01:42,294
The Americans took him and they
kicked me out. I told you so.

678
02:01:44,672 --> 02:01:46,506
We have to get out of here right away.

679
02:01:47,508 --> 02:01:49,843
It's full of Germans making
their way down The Sleeping Man.

680
02:01:50,803 --> 02:01:52,429
The Germans have lost, everyone knows.

681
02:01:52,555 --> 02:01:54,931
What are you talking about?
He who made the mistake must pay.

682
02:01:55,558 --> 02:01:56,599
Rodolfo...

683
02:01:56,892 --> 02:01:59,185
Ludovico's not the traitor anyway.

684
02:02:00,396 --> 02:02:02,439
We'll find him. Trust me.

685
02:02:13,326 --> 02:02:15,035
Do you remember the time...

686
02:02:15,911 --> 02:02:18,079
when Marco spent the week
staring at the Mountain...

687
02:02:18,205 --> 02:02:21,583
convinced that
The Sleeping Man would awaken?

688
02:02:23,002 --> 02:02:24,961
And how my mother yelled at him!

689
02:02:27,757 --> 02:02:28,923
Of course I remember.

690
02:02:29,383 --> 02:02:30,759
Sleep. Sleep.

691
02:02:32,553 --> 02:02:33,803
Marco's dead.

692
02:02:35,389 --> 02:02:36,598
I killed him.

693
02:02:37,433 --> 02:02:39,893
In a firefight
with his Fascist comrades.

694
02:02:39,977 --> 02:02:42,020
He would've done the same to me!

695
02:02:42,897 --> 02:02:44,731
Because we're Partisans.

696
02:02:46,609 --> 02:02:49,027
There's nothing left to see here.

697
02:02:52,907 --> 02:02:54,324
Peppi...

698
02:02:55,785 --> 02:02:59,746
Listen, if someone commits a sin...

699
02:02:59,872 --> 02:03:01,623
a big sin...

700
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:07,754
and then he repents...

701
02:03:08,464 --> 02:03:09,839
and confesses.

702
02:03:11,133 --> 02:03:13,385
do you think he'll go to Hell?

703
02:03:15,471 --> 02:03:17,097
I don't know. I'm not a Priest.

704
02:03:18,140 --> 02:03:19,641
What have you become?

705
02:03:20,601 --> 02:03:22,185
I don't recognize you anymore.

706
02:03:22,478 --> 02:03:24,854
You are here rationalizing.

707
02:03:24,980 --> 02:03:29,943
Always talking about my dead brother.
What do you want from me?

708
02:03:30,653 --> 02:03:33,029
Do you want to know
who betrayed you at St. Anna?

709
02:03:33,489 --> 02:03:36,157
We should have kept the German
instead of giving him to the Americans.

710
02:03:36,283 --> 02:03:38,451
Maybe we'd have discovered
that he can speak Italian.

711
02:03:38,786 --> 02:03:40,620
Maybe he would have spoke of you.

712
02:03:44,667 --> 02:03:47,961
We've known each other a lifetime,
and you think it was me?

713
02:03:48,129 --> 02:03:49,879
This is war, Peppi.

714
02:03:50,464 --> 02:03:52,882
And in war people suffer; people die!

715
02:03:53,008 --> 02:03:56,344
So, do you think the people at
St. Anna had to die because this is war?

716
02:03:57,513 --> 02:03:59,097
I didn't say that!

717
02:03:59,181 --> 02:04:00,306
I trusted you.

718
02:04:00,516 --> 02:04:04,269
It was you that
I had to meet to get supplies.

719
02:04:04,353 --> 02:04:07,814
It was you who suggested
St. Anna was a safe place.

720
02:04:08,190 --> 02:04:09,649
What did you want to do?

721
02:04:11,026 --> 02:04:12,610
Did you want revenge
because I killed your brother?

722
02:04:12,695 --> 02:04:14,070
For the last time...

723
02:04:14,196 --> 02:04:15,822
You should've told me, then I
would have let them only kill me.

724
02:04:15,906 --> 02:04:16,614
Stop talking about my dead brother.

725
02:04:16,699 --> 02:04:19,576
You killed him!

726
02:04:19,910 --> 02:04:22,829
Hundreds of innocent people.

727
02:04:22,955 --> 02:04:24,497
You sent me to Hell...

728
02:04:48,522 --> 02:04:51,024
Bastard!

729
02:10:13,889 --> 02:10:15,473
Come here. Come to me.

730
02:10:16,225 --> 02:10:17,517
Come to me, please.

731
02:12:04,499 --> 02:12:06,208
Chocolate Giant!

732
02:12:07,169 --> 02:12:08,669
The Sleeping Man.

733
02:12:20,515 --> 02:12:22,058
Get back. Get back.

734
02:13:14,194 --> 02:13:16,028
Come away. Come with me.

735
02:14:50,624 --> 02:14:52,333
Forward! Forward!

736
02:14:52,459 --> 02:14:53,667
Spread out!

737
02:14:53,794 --> 02:14:55,669
Move! Spread out!

738
02:14:55,796 --> 02:14:57,004
Forward.

739
02:14:57,130 --> 02:14:58,047
Be alert.

740
02:16:07,325 --> 02:16:09,368
Liberty!

741
02:16:43,111 --> 02:16:44,111
Forward!

742
02:17:36,331 --> 02:17:37,289
Move, move, move.

743
02:17:38,333 --> 02:17:40,626
Lock down the village. Move!

744
02:17:42,504 --> 02:17:43,671
Clear the buildings!

745
02:17:45,757 --> 02:17:47,341
Come on, kill the Blacks!

746
02:17:47,467 --> 02:17:49,009
Those pigs. This way.

747
02:17:49,135 --> 02:17:49,802
Over there.

748
02:17:56,685 --> 02:17:57,559
Go! Go! Go! Go!

749
02:18:08,029 --> 02:18:10,072
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

750
02:18:15,453 --> 02:18:16,704
Move. Move.

751
02:18:47,736 --> 02:18:48,235
Go! Go! Go!

752
02:18:48,361 --> 02:18:49,945
Run! Run!

753
02:18:51,156 --> 02:18:54,408
Stamps!

754
02:19:02,334 --> 02:19:03,709
We are Fascists!

755
02:19:04,044 --> 02:19:05,461
Fascists!

756
02:20:10,735 --> 02:20:12,820
Angelo.

757
02:20:13,947 --> 02:20:15,406
You're not dead anymore.

758
02:20:15,490 --> 02:20:17,116
Open your eyes.

759
02:20:17,951 --> 02:20:19,201
Angelo.

760
02:20:23,248 --> 02:20:25,624
Arturo, where am L?

761
02:20:25,750 --> 02:20:26,959
It's not important.

762
02:20:27,085 --> 02:20:28,460
We have to go.

763
02:20:29,087 --> 02:20:30,379
Am L going to Heaven?

764
02:20:30,755 --> 02:20:32,464
No, you're going home.

765
02:20:32,549 --> 02:20:33,590
Where's my home?

766
02:20:33,675 --> 02:20:35,467
Angelo, L'll show you.

767
02:20:35,593 --> 02:20:36,844
Who's there?

768
02:20:36,970 --> 02:20:39,263
Your Papa. Remember him?

769
02:20:40,682 --> 02:20:41,974
What about my friend...

770
02:20:42,100 --> 02:20:43,851
the Chocolate Giant?

771
02:21:00,285 --> 02:21:01,743
You have to remember him,

772
02:21:02,662 --> 02:21:03,579
me,

773
02:21:04,205 --> 02:21:05,205
all of this.

774
02:21:06,166 --> 02:21:08,542
This was our time to be children.

775
02:21:35,904 --> 02:21:36,361
Come here.

776
02:22:15,109 --> 02:22:16,109
Prepare to die.

777
02:22:18,071 --> 02:22:19,029
This is over.

778
02:22:19,614 --> 02:22:21,073
Gather the wounded...

779
02:22:21,366 --> 02:22:22,699
and bury our dead.
