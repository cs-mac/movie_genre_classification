1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,800
Previously
on "666 Park Avenue"...

2
00:00:02,859 --> 00:00:03,880
It's beautiful!

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,920
We have an interview.
Henry Martin, Jane Van Veen.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
For the position of Manager ...

5
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,000
Mr. Doran
personally selects

6
00:00:08,059 --> 00:00:09,040
tenants.

7
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,120
obviously something that
you said impressed him.

8
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:12,680
It is our way to Henry.

9
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,280
You and I are the same;
we came from nothing.

10
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,360
We must fight
tooth and nail

11
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,400
to break through
in the world.

12
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,960
Apparently Councilman Sullivan

13
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,640
has broken the rules;
his seat will become vacant.

14
00:00:25,219 --> 00:00:26,200
Henry does not approach

15
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,280
the man with the compass rose tattoo.

16
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,960
As it happened, Nona.
Did you know that Henry was in danger?

17
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,059
I found something else.
I think you might be interested.

18
00:00:35,139 --> 00:00:37,120
-What about that girl? Who is she?
-That's you.

19
00:00:37,699 --> 00:00:38,720
You are the other girl from the Drake.

20
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,760
Hey, baby, come meet
my new assistant.

21
00:00:41,339 --> 00:00:42,880
Brian, this is Alexis.

22
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,440
You have been busy
with my assistant.

23
00:00:44,499 --> 00:00:45,440
Please, can we fix it?

24
00:00:45,499 --> 00:00:46,520
I'll kill you too ...

25
00:00:48,099 --> 00:00:49,600
Oh my God, I killed her!

26
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,240
Henry, I do not feel safe here.
Do you understand that?

27
00:00:52,779 --> 00:00:53,240
I'm affraid.

28
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,920
If I were you,
I would do anything for Jane to stay.

29
00:00:59,019 --> 00:01:00,040
Are you going to tell your father?

30
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,600
You do not want to know anything about me,
Henry.

31
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,600
Details are in the invitation,

32
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,200
in case you change your mind.
You're the only family she has.

33
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,880
This building is Evil
and you are in danger living here.

34
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,000
I think the gray conveys
maturity and experience,

35
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,120
things that have become
rare nowadays.

36
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,680
I think
it looks just as good

37
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,739
as the other two that you've tried.

38
00:01:31,819 --> 00:01:34,339
Yeah, well, it's my first day,
I want to make a good impression.

39
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,960
The candidate for city council,
Henry Martin.

40
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,520
Enjoy it,
but don't become obssed with it.

41
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,680
Well, you know I'm obsessive,

42
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,720
that's why I must
have everything perfectly organized.

43
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,360
I will begin to enjoy it
 when I win the election...

44
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:49,400
and when you find my lucky socks.

45
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,960
Have you seen my blue socks?

46
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:52,040
They should be

47
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,080
perfectly organized in you drawer.

48
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,600
Yeah, well they're not.
And it's a disaster,


49
00:01:54,699 --> 00:01:56,160
because I wore them
when I passed the bar exam;

50
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,200
wore them when we got
this apartment.

51
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,800
I also wore them when I proposed to you.

52
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,080
You don't need those lucky socks, councilman.

53
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,640
I think I have ten minutes

54
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:09,680
for my favorite voter...

55
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,840
If you want my vote, Mr. Martin,

56
00:02:13,899 --> 00:02:15,440
you'll have to give me twenty...

57
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:23,760
We are murderers...

58
00:02:25,339 --> 00:02:25,800
No, we're not.

59
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,480
The dead blond in our living room
says otherwise.

60
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,120
It'd be a big blow to my mother
to see my in handucffs again.

61
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,720
We can not go to jail.
Our life would be ruined.

62
00:02:36,779 --> 00:02:38,280
She was crazy, Lou.

63
00:02:38,339 --> 00:02:40,400
Not only did she come here to kill you,

64
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,440
but she challenged us both to do it.

65
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,560
Why should we have to pay
for a hand

66
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,600
that we were forced to play?

67
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:47,680
Because we played his game, Brian.

68
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,760
And the cards on the table
look very bad.

69
00:02:51,859 --> 00:02:53,440
Your adventure, my accident...

70
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,640
We have to call the police,
we have no other options.

71
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:02,760
Yes, there is another option.

72
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,920
Nobody has to know what happened.

73
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:23,520
Is it your family?

74
00:03:25,179 --> 00:03:27,720
Yes, the...

75
00:03:28,779 --> 00:03:30,800
the baby is my daughter, Jane.

76
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,440
I came to the city for the
engagement party.

77
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,560
How time flies, huh?
- Yes

78
00:03:36,619 --> 00:03:37,640
Was the same with my two children.

79
00:03:39,179 --> 00:03:40,720
And this is my wife, Catherine.

80
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,800
A wonderful woman
and terrible cook.

81
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,619
I know I've made many mistakes
in my life, but...

82
00:03:50,619 --> 00:03:52,160
Catherine and then Jane.

83
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,800
I did not know how lucky I was.

84
00:03:56,339 --> 00:03:57,360
Luck changes, huh?

85
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,480
Yes, Catherine died suddenly.

86
00:04:38,499 --> 00:04:39,480
How did she die?

87
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:47,280
Well...

88
00:04:48,859 --> 00:04:49,840
it was very strange,

89
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,000
Catherine drowned...
in the bathtub.

90
00:05:43,499 --> 00:05:47,560
Help...

91
00:05:57,561 --> 00:06:01,168
666 Park Avenue
S01E13 Lazarus

Translation, editing and sync by:
Jerry Shadoe

93
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:09,400
Good morning, Mr. Doran.
-Good morning, Tony.

94
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,600
Patrick Corey, from 2D,
is permanently gone.

95
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:15,120
I want you to help Jane

96
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,720
prepare the apartment for rent.

97
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:18,280
Yeah, no problem.

98
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,400
Mr. Corey
didn't last long here, huh?

99
00:06:21,459 --> 00:06:22,960
Longer than I hoped.

100
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,080
To tell you the truth, I don't really care.

101
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:28,120
Why not?

102
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,200
I didn't really like Mr. Corey.

103
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:31,760
Me neither.

104
00:06:36,499 --> 00:06:37,480
Good morning, Jane.

105
00:06:38,059 --> 00:06:39,040
Oh, hello, Gavin.

106
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,200
Thanks again for the party
last night. It was wonderful.

107
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:43,240
Champagne hangover?

108
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:44,800
No, I'm fine.

109
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,920
I didn't have the opportunity to speak
with your father.

110
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,520
I think he left here
rather abruptly.

111
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,640
Yes, the situation is complicated.

112
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,200
I don't want to intrude.
-No, no...

113
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,320
I stayed with him for coffee, to...

114
00:06:58,859 --> 00:06:59,880
clarify a few things.

115
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,960
You don't have to explain.
-Thanks, Gavin.

116
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,600
Wow, impressive to see your name here.

117
00:07:20,179 --> 00:07:20,680
Yes, thank you.

118
00:07:21,739 --> 00:07:22,720
Have you already started working?

119
00:07:23,299 --> 00:07:24,320
Yes, I bring coffee

120
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,440
as my contribution
to the campaign

121
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,480
And I thought you weren't
interested in politics.

122
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:30,520
The future worries me.

123
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,640
I want to thank you all
for being here...

124
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,720
and... participating in this...

125
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,760
We undertake a good fight.

126
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,880
Clean, fair, and with integrity.

127
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,440
We will accomplish great things

128
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,040
for District 53 of Manhattan.

129
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,360
Well, nothing more. I promise
I will improve my speech.

130
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:07,480
And now... let's get to work.

131
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:12,160
Mr. Martin, I'm Earl.

132
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,720
Anything you need, I'm here.

133
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:15,280
Well, Earl, thank you.

134
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,400
You are the candidate
that the city needs.

135
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,960
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

136
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:25,120
Well, all you have to do is win.

137
00:08:25,179 --> 00:08:26,720
I don't understand much about politics,

138
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,240
but... I have a good feeling.

139
00:08:29,474 --> 00:08:30,585
Yes, good morning, tell me.

140
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,720
There are many things to explain
about what happened.

141
00:08:41,819 --> 00:08:43,379
You would not understand.

142
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,520
I know I'm connected to the Drake.

143
00:08:48,099 --> 00:08:50,120
I know that my grandmother was
raised here.

144
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,680
And now I find out that you and Mom

145
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,720
lived there when I was a baby...

146
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,000
It can not be a coincidence,
it has to mean something.

147
00:08:59,499 --> 00:09:01,040
I don't know what it is, Jane.

148
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,080
Well, you can not come into my life

149
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,640
and just tell me that I am in danger.

150
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,200
I already know I'm in danger.

151
00:09:06,819 --> 00:09:08,840
But there must be a reason

152
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,880
why I'm back where it all began.

153
00:09:12,499 --> 00:09:13,560
Daddy, tell me.

154
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:17,120
Why have I returned to the Drake?

155
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:20,800
You know, your mother asked
herself the same question?

156
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,440
And that's what led her
to the abyss...

157
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:27,040
What do you mean?

158
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:30,680
When you were just a baby,

159
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,280
I thought she was just experiencing
a period of depression

160
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,440
that was due to the stress of moving
into a new place or something.

161
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,600
But since then, I realized,
The Drake has changed, Jane.

162
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,240
I don't even want to think about
something similar happening to you.

163
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:48,320
During all these years,

164
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:55,120
the only thing I recieved from you...
were a handful of letters...

165
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,840
a couple of calls...
a couple of visits...

166
00:10:00,379 --> 00:10:01,400
Dad...

167
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,560
was there a reason you abandoned me?

168
00:10:08,659 --> 00:10:10,160
I was trying to protect you.

169
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:12,320
From what?

170
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:15,440
From the truth.

171
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,120
But you living in that terrible place

172
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:22,680
means I failed.

173
00:10:29,979 --> 00:10:32,520
Yeah?
- Of course.

174
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,160
Henry?
Mr. Doran wants to see you.

175
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,840
Well, Mr. Polumbo,
that's a very generous amount

176
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,440
Well, thank you sir,
I am grateful.

177
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:44,520
All right. Goodbye.

178
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,619
A "generous amount";
sounds promising.

179
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,120
$ 10

180
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,320
Mr. Polumbo is 88 years old
and is willing to support us.

181
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,920
You have a gift for connecting with
people, Henry.

182
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,040
I hope that you will have
the opportunity to prove it.

183
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,560
For that we have to win the elections.

184
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,680
I havce noticed that all
the candidates

185
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,800
have attacked our dishonorable counselor.

186
00:11:04,859 --> 00:11:05,800
All, except you.

187
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,920
Yes, I do not have to crush
Sullivan or anyone

188
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,000
to show people who I am.

189
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,040
Yeah, I suppose that's a way of looking at it.

190
00:11:12,099 --> 00:11:13,080
What's the other?

191
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,200
Que tácitamente
Tacticly adopt the behavior.

192
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,720
What are you saying, Gavin?
Of course not!

193
00:11:17,299 --> 00:11:18,280
Yes, I know.

194
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,840
But you already know that in politics

195
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,400
you are against
or you are in favor.

196
00:11:24,579 --> 00:11:25,560
"Vote for integrity."

197
00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:26,640
Your sights are high.

198
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,760
But many people will try to bring you down.

199
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:32,320
Let them try.

200
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,000
Henry, I have no doubt that you
can be a great politician.

201
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,560
And I worry that ethics
will not let you get there.

202
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:45,840
One, two...

203
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,200
It's impossible for this to work.

204
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,840
Lou, we burned the caarpet,
cleaned the floor,

205
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,960
we burned the fire poker

206
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,960
to remove all traces of DNA.

207
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:03,520
What else are we missing?

208
00:12:03,579 --> 00:12:04,560
A dose of sanity?

209
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,200
Everything will be okay,
I promise.

210
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,800
Right?
-Yes.

211
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,880
Right.
- Well...

212
00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:14,440
What part of the basement?

213
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,040
The boiler room.
Let's go...

214
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,880
What is it that you wanted to talk to me about, Jane?

215
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,960
I don't mean to impose,

216
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:28,480
but why didn't you tell me...

217
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,520
 I had already lived in this building?

218
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:33,720
I had no idea that
you were the same girl

219
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,320
we saw out walking in Central Park.

220
00:12:36,859 --> 00:12:37,400
When we interviewed you,

221
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,960
you had given us a different name
than that of your mother and father.

222
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:40,960
So you had no clue?

223
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,640
Not until last night when we saw
Nate at the party.

224
00:12:44,699 --> 00:12:45,680
Forgive us, Jane.

225
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,760
We wanted to tell you,
but found

226
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,320
your engagement party
was not the right time

227
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,920
to... bring up... a... traumatic matter.

228
00:12:53,499 --> 00:12:54,520
Why do you say traumatic?

229
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,200
What are you saying?

230
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,880
You must know something...
about the death of your mother.

231
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:07,520
I know she drowned

232
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,640
when I was a baby,
while swimming in the lake.

233
00:13:13,299 --> 00:13:14,280
No, Jane...

234
00:13:17,939 --> 00:13:21,560
It happened in her apartment,

235
00:13:21,619 --> 00:13:23,640
here at the Drake.

236
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,320
No. The accident was in the lake house in Indiana.

237
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,440
No, it happened here, Jane.
And it was no accident.

238
00:13:32,499 --> 00:13:34,040
How was it not an accident?

239
00:13:35,099 --> 00:13:36,120
Nothing was proven,

240
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,240
but the police talked about a murder.

241
00:13:43,939 --> 00:13:44,440
But...

242
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:47,560
I'm sorry to say,

243
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,720
but the main suspect in her death...
was your father.

244
00:14:02,789 --> 00:14:03,809
This is not a good idea, Brian.

245
00:14:04,369 --> 00:14:06,409
Hiding the body of Alexis
here in the basement?

246
00:14:10,089 --> 00:14:11,609
Lou, it's impossible to
get her out of the building

247
00:14:11,669 --> 00:14:12,649
without someone seeing us, ok?

248
00:14:13,729 --> 00:14:16,289
Furthermore, nobody ever comes down here.

249
00:14:16,369 --> 00:14:17,889
And what do we do afer we walled her in, huh?

250
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:18,889
Then what?

251
00:14:18,969 --> 00:14:20,969
We go home and forget all about this.

252
00:14:26,189 --> 00:14:27,209
No murder goes unpunished.

253
00:14:27,769 --> 00:14:29,289
No. It is impossible to get rif of it.

254
00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:31,889
Yes.

255
00:14:33,469 --> 00:14:35,529
It happens. All the time.

256
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:39,169
We will wake up tomorrow

257
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:41,249
and pretend none of this,

258
00:14:41,809 --> 00:14:44,889
none of this... happened.
Huh?

259
00:14:45,449 --> 00:14:47,489
And we can do it
with a clear conscience

260
00:14:47,569 --> 00:14:50,089
because we both know
none of this

261
00:14:50,169 --> 00:14:51,629
would have happened
if not for her.

262
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:53,169
I just want us to be who we were

263
00:14:53,289 --> 00:14:54,789
before she came into our lives.

264
00:14:54,789 --> 00:14:56,849
Yes, I do too.

265
00:14:57,929 --> 00:15:03,089
I haven't thanked you...
for saving my life.

266
00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:05,169
We saved each other, Lou.

267
00:15:08,329 --> 00:15:09,849
All the sites say the same thing;

268
00:15:09,929 --> 00:15:10,889
My mother drowned in the bathtub.

269
00:15:11,449 --> 00:15:12,969
She didn't fall,
she didn't hit her head...

270
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:16,569
The only logical explanation,
is murder

271
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:20,769
Not for nothing, but
he leaves you with relatives

272
00:15:21,329 --> 00:15:22,849
and completely disappears
out of your life...

273
00:15:23,409 --> 00:15:26,489
Sounds like guilt.
And why come back now?

274
00:15:27,049 --> 00:15:30,649
I don't know.
Suppose it was murder.

275
00:15:31,729 --> 00:15:33,769
Should we wonder why he did it?

276
00:15:35,929 --> 00:15:38,449
It says my father
 killed my mother

277
00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:39,489
because she had an affair.

278
00:15:40,049 --> 00:15:41,569
You were eight months old when she died.

279
00:15:42,169 --> 00:15:44,689
I don't know,
breastfeeding, changing diapers,

280
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:46,809
and cheating on her husband
at the same time?

281
00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:49,369
It's true. It seems odd.

282
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,489
Well. I have to go back.

283
00:15:52,009 --> 00:15:54,609
My first day of internship
and I'm out two hours.

284
00:15:55,629 --> 00:15:56,169
Imagine.

285
00:15:58,229 --> 00:15:58,689
What?

286
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:02,690
Something happened to me
 this morning while I was in the bathtub.

287
00:16:02,909 --> 00:16:03,969
Tell me, don't be affraid.

288
00:16:04,049 --> 00:16:06,009
It was before we knew any of this.

289
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:09,649
I hooked my foot
on the chain stopper and...

290
00:16:11,789 --> 00:16:12,769
slipped underwater.

291
00:16:13,349 --> 00:16:14,289
You slipped?

292
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:15,889
Felt like something was
thrown at me;

293
00:16:15,969 --> 00:16:18,009
I couldn't sit up;
I thought I was drowning...

294
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:20,569
The Drake killed your mother and
now wants to kill you?

295
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:23,169
I don't think so because,
when I was under water,

296
00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:26,289
I saw someone watching me.

297
00:16:27,869 --> 00:16:28,369
A man.

298
00:16:28,949 --> 00:16:29,929
Who?

299
00:16:31,009 --> 00:16:34,649
I don't know, when I got up
he was no longer there.

300
00:16:35,689 --> 00:16:36,729
The Drake pulls you up here

301
00:16:36,789 --> 00:16:38,289
from 1000 miles away...

302
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:39,849
and the ghost of your grandmother

303
00:16:39,929 --> 00:16:41,889
shows you fragments
of your family's past.

304
00:16:41,969 --> 00:16:45,009
I can't help but think that your mother

305
00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:46,569
is trying to tell you something.

306
00:16:47,669 --> 00:16:48,649
That my father killed her?

307
00:16:49,229 --> 00:16:50,209
Or who did.

308
00:16:55,489 --> 00:16:56,449
How are you?
I'm Henry Martin...

309
00:16:56,509 --> 00:16:57,489
I present myself as councilman

310
00:16:57,569 --> 00:16:58,569
in this special election,

311
00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:00,609
Thank you.
I ask for your vote.

312
00:17:00,689 --> 00:17:02,169
You have decieved us all, Martin.

313
00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:04,809
They think you're a good man.

314
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:06,849
Have a nice day,
Mr. Sullivan.

315
00:17:08,469 --> 00:17:09,489
Great diversionary maneuver.

316
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:11,529
I did nothing.
Leave me alone.

317
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:13,569
Sure, "Mister Right Place Right Time."

318
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:15,169
An opportunist.

319
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:18,289
Which basically means we are the same.

320
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:20,409
Hey, Henry?
Look at me.

321
00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:21,969
This is what awaits you.

322
00:17:22,469 --> 00:17:23,529
Been drinking?

323
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:25,569
Yeah, Irish Whiskey.

324
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:28,209
But I guess you are
more Scottish.

325
00:17:28,709 --> 00:17:29,769
He slept with an intern.

326
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:31,809
He ruined his career
and his marriage;

327
00:17:31,889 --> 00:17:33,369
It's his fault, not mine.
Very well.

328
00:17:34,489 --> 00:17:36,009
You continue to pretend
that you're different

329
00:17:37,049 --> 00:17:38,569
But we all end up with blood on our hands.

330
00:17:39,149 --> 00:17:40,689
I'll tell you a secret, Henry,

331
00:17:41,729 --> 00:17:44,769
The blood will eventually be yours.

332
00:18:07,189 --> 00:18:08,209
I love you.

333
00:18:10,349 --> 00:18:11,329
I love you too.

334
00:18:23,849 --> 00:18:26,929
It seems that things
are getting better.

335
00:18:27,989 --> 00:18:29,529
We will try, Mr. Doran...

336
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,609
It's worth it to fight
for your relationship.

337
00:18:32,149 --> 00:18:33,169
It's admirable.

338
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:36,809
Later.
-Good-bye.

339
00:18:37,889 --> 00:18:41,009
Louise, I think you've lost an earring.

340
00:18:45,169 --> 00:18:47,729
Oh, God, we will not...
be walled in with Alexis...

341
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:49,289
Brian!

342
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:05,409
Think Lou, When waas the last time you saw him?

343
00:19:05,489 --> 00:19:06,449
The truth is that I haven't thought

344
00:19:06,529 --> 00:19:07,969
about my earring the last couple hours.

345
00:19:08,569 --> 00:19:10,609
Maybe you left them at Patrick's
like the others.

346
00:19:10,689 --> 00:19:12,689
Oh really?
That's how you want to fix this?

347
00:19:12,769 --> 00:19:14,249
Well I don't think you adventure

348
00:19:14,329 --> 00:19:15,289
has contributed anything
to our marital happiness.

349
00:19:15,369 --> 00:19:16,849
No, you're right.
I'm sorry.

350
00:19:16,929 --> 00:19:18,409
We must remain united in this...

351
00:19:18,469 --> 00:19:19,969
or everything will fall apart.

352
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:23,569
We gotta think about how.

353
00:19:24,149 --> 00:19:25,209
I never wanna see that basement again.

354
00:19:25,729 --> 00:19:27,769
We have done everything possible
to erase our tracks.

355
00:19:28,329 --> 00:19:30,889
We can't risk something so small
betraying us.

356
00:19:30,949 --> 00:19:32,969
We have to go back down.

357
00:19:35,069 --> 00:19:35,569
All right.

358
00:19:58,469 --> 00:19:59,009
Did you kill her?

359
00:20:02,109 --> 00:20:03,109
Don't ask me that, Jane.

360
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,209
No. The conversation...

361
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:09,369
you've been avoiding all my life,
we will have it now.

362
00:20:10,429 --> 00:20:11,969
Yeah, I guess so.

363
00:20:13,569 --> 00:20:18,209
The papers said that she had...
an affair.

364
00:20:18,749 --> 00:20:20,249
She did and it was over.

365
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:23,409
So you killed her for it?

366
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:27,049
Absolutely not.
Absolutely not.

367
00:20:28,129 --> 00:20:30,169
We managed to overcome it;
She left him and I convinced her

368
00:20:30,249 --> 00:20:32,769
to come with me to New York
to start all over.

369
00:20:32,849 --> 00:20:35,369
A new life with our baby.

370
00:20:35,449 --> 00:20:37,449
So why did the police
suspect you?

371
00:20:38,009 --> 00:20:40,049
Because there were
no signs of forced entry.

372
00:20:40,609 --> 00:20:43,169
The door was locked when
I arrived. Okay?

373
00:20:43,729 --> 00:20:44,729
And the police thought I was

374
00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:46,289
the only on who could enter.

375
00:20:46,349 --> 00:20:48,369
I did not kill your mother!

376
00:20:52,569 --> 00:20:54,609
Listen, come here...
Come here!

377
00:20:56,729 --> 00:20:59,809
Listen,
I tried to help your mother.

378
00:20:59,869 --> 00:21:00,849
Help her how?!

379
00:21:04,009 --> 00:21:06,049
Dad, what are you telling me?

380
00:21:08,169 --> 00:21:11,769
All right.
Jane..., your mother was insane.

381
00:21:12,849 --> 00:21:14,849
She was obsessed with the Drake.

382
00:21:15,489 --> 00:21:16,449
She said that the building was full

383
00:21:16,529 --> 00:21:19,569
of secret rooms,
and then she started having hallucinations.

384
00:21:20,649 --> 00:21:23,729
The building "spoke to her," you know?

385
00:21:23,789 --> 00:21:25,809
It showed her things.

386
00:21:25,889 --> 00:21:28,409
I had to get her out of there
before she went mad.

387
00:21:29,469 --> 00:21:30,449
And I failed.

388
00:21:33,629 --> 00:21:34,649
What if it was true?

389
00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:38,809
Dad...,

390
00:21:40,409 --> 00:21:42,969
strange things happen...
in that building.

391
00:21:45,069 --> 00:21:46,049
I see them too.

392
00:21:46,649 --> 00:21:48,129
Jane,
you have to get out of there.

393
00:21:48,729 --> 00:21:51,249
No, no, do it...
or you will die there just like your mother.

394
00:21:51,329 --> 00:21:52,329
Seriously...
-I can't...

395
00:21:52,409 --> 00:21:54,369
No, Jane! Listen to me!
-No, you listen to me!

396
00:21:54,949 --> 00:21:55,449
Jane...

397
00:21:55,529 --> 00:21:57,529
You've never been a father to me
since I was born.

398
00:21:58,089 --> 00:22:00,129
And threatening me is not the best
way to start. Do you understand?

399
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:02,209
Heh! Is there a problem?

400
00:22:02,749 --> 00:22:03,769
No, no...

401
00:22:04,849 --> 00:22:08,409
Look...,
stay way from my life.

402
00:22:10,589 --> 00:22:11,569
Understand?

403
00:22:23,549 --> 00:22:25,089
I'll take that whiskey now..

404
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:38,089
Jane?

405
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:44,809
Jane, are you here?

406
00:22:50,609 --> 00:22:52,609
Sullivan!
What are you doing here?

407
00:22:54,229 --> 00:22:55,729
No go, Henry.

408
00:22:58,909 --> 00:22:59,929
Look at what they made you...

409
00:23:02,569 --> 00:23:06,129
They take and take until
there is nothing left...

410
00:23:06,209 --> 00:23:08,769
He's wounded, let me help.
-You've already done enough.

411
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:15,489
Henry!

412
00:23:16,069 --> 00:23:16,569
Yeah, what's up?

413
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:18,129
God,
you gotta see this...

414
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:22,289
Shocking news,

415
00:23:22,369 --> 00:23:23,369
recently disgraced
councilman

416
00:23:23,889 --> 00:23:26,449
Frank Sullivan, of New York,
was found dead

417
00:23:26,529 --> 00:23:28,009
in his apartment
on the Upper East Side.

418
00:23:28,569 --> 00:23:31,089
According to police,
Mr. Sullivan

419
00:23:31,169 --> 00:23:33,209
allegedly committed suicide by
shooting himself in the head.

420
00:23:39,489 --> 00:23:42,529
According to police sources,
Mr. Sullivan's neighbor

421
00:23:42,609 --> 00:23:44,649
saw him enter his apartment alone

422
00:23:44,729 --> 00:23:46,729
shortly before hearing
a single gunshot...

423
00:23:46,849 --> 00:23:48,249
The police officers who responded to the call

424
00:23:48,329 --> 00:23:50,889
forced their way into the home and made...

425
00:23:50,969 --> 00:23:52,929
Call Henry.
-Hello, Henry.

426
00:23:55,069 --> 00:23:55,569
Gavin, what happens now?

427
00:23:56,649 --> 00:23:59,729
The first rule in politics
is to admit

428
00:23:59,809 --> 00:24:02,329
when you made a mistake,
and I made one.

429
00:24:02,389 --> 00:24:03,409
You know about Sullivan?

430
00:24:03,929 --> 00:24:05,969
While other candidates,
preyed upon him,

431
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:07,049
you chose the way of ethics.

432
00:24:08,069 --> 00:24:09,089
And I think it was worth it.

433
00:24:09,169 --> 00:24:11,169
His problems began
when an anonymous source

434
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:12,729
leaked information to the press

435
00:24:13,269 --> 00:24:13,729
about his affair...

436
00:24:13,809 --> 00:24:15,849
Sullivan's life crumbled.

437
00:24:16,409 --> 00:24:18,969
It made no sense to point out
what the whole city already knew...

438
00:24:19,029 --> 00:24:20,529
I don't want to seem gruesome,

439
00:24:20,609 --> 00:24:22,609
but I hope your noble intentions get

440
00:24:22,689 --> 00:24:24,689
their results at the polls.

441
00:24:25,769 --> 00:24:27,289
I told you Henry,
you were born to be a politician.

442
00:24:29,389 --> 00:24:30,449
Gavin, this wasn't calculated.

443
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:32,489
Of course not.

444
00:24:33,609 --> 00:24:36,129
Stop on by later for a drink.
I'll be awake.

445
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:39,809
Thanks, but I'll pass.

446
00:24:57,489 --> 00:24:59,529
This is crazy, I can't
believe we're doing this.

447
00:24:59,609 --> 00:25:01,049
The only thing that could lead
them back to us

448
00:25:01,109 --> 00:25:02,129
is your earing.

449
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,209
You said no one would
find the body here.

450
00:25:04,809 --> 00:25:06,329
We can't risk it, okay?

451
00:25:10,489 --> 00:25:12,009
Lou, I know your earrings will be here.

452
00:25:12,589 --> 00:25:13,089
It must be...

453
00:25:16,729 --> 00:25:18,249
wait, I need to be alone.

454
00:25:18,829 --> 00:25:19,809
Now...

455
00:25:20,909 --> 00:25:23,489
Well, the flashlight...

456
00:25:26,089 --> 00:25:28,609
It can't be...
-What? Brian, what?

457
00:25:29,209 --> 00:25:30,209
Brian!
-Look...

458
00:25:33,869 --> 00:25:36,409
My God... And the body?

459
00:25:37,549 --> 00:25:38,529
I don't know.

460
00:25:39,109 --> 00:25:40,049
Alexis is with me.

461
00:25:43,789 --> 00:25:44,769
I believe this is yours.

462
00:25:48,469 --> 00:25:49,449
Well, this is an ugly topic.

463
00:25:54,149 --> 00:25:55,649
She tried to kil me, you know?

464
00:25:55,709 --> 00:25:57,249
It was self-defense...

465
00:25:57,329 --> 00:25:58,809
We had no choice...
- Yes...

466
00:25:58,869 --> 00:25:59,849
Brian, once told me that

467
00:26:00,969 --> 00:26:03,489
you'd give everything to 
succeed again.

468
00:26:05,629 --> 00:26:06,609
I have good news.

469
00:26:06,689 --> 00:26:10,289
Your work will be a great success.

470
00:26:11,329 --> 00:26:13,409
But I'm afraid
you will not celebrate...

471
00:26:14,429 --> 00:26:15,409
I don't understand.

472
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:19,129
Louise, from that night

473
00:26:19,689 --> 00:26:21,209
that you ran Alexis over with your car,

474
00:26:21,709 --> 00:26:23,209
she lived on borrowed time from me.

475
00:26:25,349 --> 00:26:25,849
What do you mean?

476
00:26:26,369 --> 00:26:28,449
You belong to me,
both of you.

477
00:26:31,069 --> 00:26:32,129
And I declare the lease terminated.

478
00:26:35,289 --> 00:26:36,809
Oh, Gavin...
-Gavin, wait!

479
00:26:36,869 --> 00:26:37,809
Please!

480
00:26:37,869 --> 00:26:38,369
It's payback time.

481
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:39,369
-Wait...
-Gavin!

482
00:26:39,429 --> 00:26:40,369
Gavin!

483
00:26:40,429 --> 00:26:43,049
Gavin, please! Gavin!

484
00:26:46,669 --> 00:26:48,169
Gavin, get us out of here!

485
00:26:48,289 --> 00:26:51,329
Gavin! No!
-Gavin!

486
00:26:52,909 --> 00:26:53,969
No coverage...

487
00:26:58,669 --> 00:27:00,689
Brian, I'm afraid...

488
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:04,809
We're together, right, Lou?

489
00:27:07,989 --> 00:27:09,009
I'll never leave...

490
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:29,849
What are you doing here?

491
00:27:30,409 --> 00:27:33,409
I told you to get away from me! Dad!

492
00:27:34,009 --> 00:27:36,049
If you see things like your mother,
you are in danger.

493
00:27:36,609 --> 00:27:38,649
I will not let this building
take possession of you too

494
00:27:39,209 --> 00:27:40,729
Dad, you're drunk and you don't know
what you're saying

495
00:27:40,809 --> 00:27:43,329
Why don't you come back...
- I'm not leaving here without you!

496
00:27:43,869 --> 00:27:44,849
Do you hear me?

497
00:27:44,909 --> 00:27:46,449
My God, why do you have a gun?

498
00:27:46,509 --> 00:27:47,489
I can't leave you here...

499
00:27:47,549 --> 00:27:49,049
I can't, it's not safe;

500
00:27:49,129 --> 00:27:51,129
this place will kill you likke it killed
your beloved mother.

501
00:27:51,209 --> 00:27:53,729
I couldn't save here,
but I will save you.

502
00:27:53,809 --> 00:27:55,289
Please let me call Henry...
Please...

503
00:27:55,369 --> 00:27:57,369
You can call him from the street,
now, let's go.

504
00:28:00,009 --> 00:28:02,049
Dad, please...
Get off me!

505
00:28:20,809 --> 00:28:22,849
Don't look at me like that,
it breaks my heart.

506
00:28:23,389 --> 00:28:24,409
How do you want me to look?

507
00:28:28,089 --> 00:28:30,129
The day you were born
was the happiest day of my life.

508
00:28:32,249 --> 00:28:35,849
You and your mother...
you were everything to me.

509
00:28:37,969 --> 00:28:42,609
Hey, I know I haven't been
a father to you, I know.

510
00:28:43,169 --> 00:28:44,689
I never helped with homework

511
00:28:44,769 --> 00:28:47,809
wasn't there for your dance recitals, but

512
00:28:51,489 --> 00:28:54,569
I'm here now.
And I'll protect you.

513
00:28:56,689 --> 00:28:59,249
Even if it means
you'll never speak to me again,

514
00:28:59,789 --> 00:29:01,329
I'll know you're safe.

515
00:29:01,889 --> 00:29:05,489
Dad, please, let's go
somewhere to talk.

516
00:29:14,889 --> 00:29:16,409
Why are we going?
-I don't know.

517
00:29:26,309 --> 00:29:27,849
What are we doing here, Gavin?

518
00:29:27,929 --> 00:29:29,409
The doorman told me from the lobby.

519
00:29:30,489 --> 00:29:32,569
I brought you here so that we can
talk like gentlemen.

520
00:29:34,109 --> 00:29:34,609
Jane, no!

521
00:29:41,929 --> 00:29:46,049
Well, Nate. It appears that
circumstances have changed.

522
00:29:50,864 --> 00:29:53,404
Nate. Drop the gun.

523
00:29:53,964 --> 00:29:56,004
This shouldn't end up like
it did with Catherine.

524
00:29:56,584 --> 00:29:57,564
I did not kill my wife!

525
00:29:58,164 --> 00:30:00,684
Dad, please, let's go...
Let's talk about this...

526
00:30:00,764 --> 00:30:03,804
I didn't kill your mother. I swear
on your soul that I didn't.

527
00:30:03,884 --> 00:30:05,404
You were completly drunk.

528
00:30:05,964 --> 00:30:07,484
Do you even remember
what happened that night?

529
00:30:07,564 --> 00:30:10,604
Drunk or not, I would have
never hurt Catherine...

530
00:30:10,664 --> 00:30:11,084
Yet, here you are

531
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:13,204
pointing a gun at your
own daughter.

532
00:30:14,224 --> 00:30:15,764
Ironic or predictable??

533
00:30:16,304 --> 00:30:17,804
Come on, Jane, let's go.

534
00:30:21,544 --> 00:30:22,484
Jane?

535
00:30:29,824 --> 00:30:30,844
Jane?

536
00:30:31,384 --> 00:30:31,924
Jane?

537
00:31:01,044 --> 00:31:02,564
Nate, drop your gun
before someone gets hurt.

538
00:31:05,704 --> 00:31:08,804
I can't, it wont let me.

539
00:31:09,864 --> 00:31:10,924
You know what that sound like?

540
00:31:11,944 --> 00:31:12,484
Nate, you need help.

541
00:31:13,524 --> 00:31:16,084
Dad, please...
Everything will be alright...

542
00:31:19,784 --> 00:31:20,764
Give me the gun.

543
00:31:23,404 --> 00:31:25,444
I'm trying but,
I can't move my arm.

544
00:31:28,124 --> 00:31:30,644
Jane?
-Henry, get out!

545
00:31:33,804 --> 00:31:35,804
Nate, what the hell are you doing?
-Dad, no!

546
00:31:36,384 --> 00:31:37,404
Sorry, I can't stop!

547
00:31:48,344 --> 00:31:49,364
Henry!

548
00:31:51,464 --> 00:31:52,004
Oh, my God...

549
00:31:52,524 --> 00:31:55,084
Honey, you'll be fine...
Help him, please!

550
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,164
Look at me,
you're gonna be okay... huh?

551
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:00,804
No, no, no...
Hang on, my love, hold...

552
00:32:00,864 --> 00:32:01,364
I didn't shoot him.

553
00:32:06,544 --> 00:32:07,564
Dad, help!

554
00:32:08,124 --> 00:32:10,684
Henry... No, no, no...
Look at me baby, look at me...

555
00:32:10,744 --> 00:32:11,724
Dad!

556
00:32:13,304 --> 00:32:13,764
Oh, my God!

557
00:32:22,164 --> 00:32:24,204
The button for the lobby
doesn't work, Mr. McKenny...

558
00:32:27,344 --> 00:32:28,884
We should go down to the basement.

559
00:32:37,744 --> 00:32:38,764
Help him, please.

560
00:32:42,964 --> 00:32:45,524
First I have to tell you something.
-Henry is dying!

561
00:32:46,084 --> 00:32:47,604
You have to know the truth about the Drake.

562
00:32:48,164 --> 00:32:49,684
You have to know why you're here.

563
00:32:50,264 --> 00:32:51,244
Why am I here?

564
00:32:52,324 --> 00:32:55,924
You're here because...
I loved your mother.

565
00:32:59,604 --> 00:33:01,644
She had a special connection
with the Drake.

566
00:33:02,704 --> 00:33:03,724
It's something that runs in your family.

567
00:33:04,784 --> 00:33:07,884
The affair, it was you?

568
00:33:11,024 --> 00:33:12,044
You betrayed me, Jane.

569
00:33:21,944 --> 00:33:22,964
What could I do?

570
00:33:44,324 --> 00:33:46,884
I couldn't let you
get away from me.

571
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:01,444
You killed her because of me?

572
00:34:01,984 --> 00:34:04,044
Nate McKenny is not your father.

573
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:07,164
No. No!

574
00:34:08,244 --> 00:34:11,324
Catherine knew and
I think Nate suspected.

575
00:34:12,464 --> 00:34:15,524
He... fled with you in the middles of the night...

576
00:34:16,564 --> 00:34:17,564
and had you hidden with family...

577
00:34:19,164 --> 00:34:22,764
I hoped with all my soul
to see you again,

578
00:34:23,844 --> 00:34:25,404
to meet again with my daughter...

579
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:30,044
And that one day,
you'll come back home.

580
00:34:37,344 --> 00:34:38,364
I can save Henry.

581
00:34:41,004 --> 00:34:43,564
Please.
Please, I'll do anything.

582
00:34:45,144 --> 00:34:46,204
You have to understand, Jane,

583
00:34:48,284 --> 00:34:52,404
that there is a price to pay
for what one wants most.

584
00:35:10,164 --> 00:35:13,724
ONE YEAR LATER

585
00:35:27,284 --> 00:35:30,364
"Author of theater and his wife disappeared."

586
00:35:31,984 --> 00:35:33,964
Baseman Theatre Company presents:
"Invisible Ink"

587
00:35:35,624 --> 00:35:40,244
Henry Martin wins the councilman
position by a landslide

588
00:35:59,544 --> 00:36:02,564
The renovation of the Drake is started.

589
00:36:14,604 --> 00:36:17,164
You're finally here!
Dinner is almost ready.

590
00:36:17,244 --> 00:36:19,244
I'm sorry, Olivia, it was my fault.

591
00:36:19,324 --> 00:36:21,844
Yeah, got stuck in 
a duct on the fifth floor,

592
00:36:21,924 --> 00:36:24,964
I had to go rescue her.
-My hero to the rescue...

593
00:36:25,044 --> 00:36:27,044
I was getting ready.
-This is for you.

594
00:36:27,104 --> 00:36:29,644
Chateau Monet, my favorite.

595
00:36:30,704 --> 00:36:32,204
Come in, Gavin is in the lounge.

596
00:36:34,864 --> 00:36:35,884
Mr. and Mrs. Councilman.

597
00:36:36,964 --> 00:36:39,004
We have seen the hall of starlings.

598
00:36:39,084 --> 00:36:40,564
It's magnificent. Seriously Jane,

599
00:36:41,124 --> 00:36:43,164
the restoration 
deserves an award.

600
00:36:43,244 --> 00:36:45,244
I'm dying to show it to my
friends of the Architecture Digest.

601
00:36:45,324 --> 00:36:48,364
Thank you. But, there's
still plenty to do.

602
00:36:48,924 --> 00:36:52,004
At the rate I'm going,
The Drake will take a lifetime.

603
00:36:58,264 --> 00:36:59,804
I never get tired of these views.

604
00:37:02,944 --> 00:37:03,964
Do you know what today is?

605
00:37:05,044 --> 00:37:08,124
-Of course. -
A year ago, you knew the exact truth

606
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,684
and you made a choice.

607
00:37:10,744 --> 00:37:11,724
Are you happy?

608
00:37:12,364 --> 00:37:13,844
I have everything I want,
a husband...

609
00:37:13,924 --> 00:37:18,524
incredible success, safety, luxury...

610
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:21,084
Why wouldn't I be happy?

611
00:37:21,684 --> 00:37:23,204
I told you that there
was a price to pay

612
00:37:23,284 --> 00:37:26,804
to save Henry's life.
Was it worth it?

613
00:37:28,424 --> 00:37:31,564
Sometimes... I have doubts.

614
00:37:34,684 --> 00:37:39,324
What we do, Dad...
- Is... meet needs.

615
00:37:40,384 --> 00:37:41,924
And there's nothing wrong with that.

616
00:37:44,044 --> 00:37:47,124
We offer desperate people
a taste of what they want most

617
00:37:47,184 --> 00:37:48,644
and in return we can live well.

618
00:37:49,744 --> 00:37:52,324
A life without fear or doubt.

619
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:55,444
The power to make the world
what we want,

620
00:37:55,984 --> 00:37:57,524
not what we are given.

621
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:01,684
The Drake is
you natural right, Jane.

622
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,244
Your legacy.

623
00:38:05,404 --> 00:38:08,444
You and Henry...
will have a son.

624
00:38:09,504 --> 00:38:10,524
Soon, I hope.

625
00:38:11,604 --> 00:38:14,124
He'll be a very powerful
figure in this country.

626
00:38:15,244 --> 00:38:19,844
The most feared leader...
that will heal the world

627
00:38:21,444 --> 00:38:22,964
under his control.

628
00:38:24,584 --> 00:38:26,124
Great things, Jane.

629
00:38:27,184 --> 00:38:28,204
A new order.

630
00:38:33,424 --> 00:38:33,924
Hey, Jane...

631
00:38:34,484 --> 00:38:36,524
Olivia is collecting;
we should go now.

632
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:38,084
Well, I'll see you inside.

633
00:38:42,264 --> 00:38:42,764
Are you okay?

634
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:45,324
Henry...

635
00:38:48,024 --> 00:38:49,524
I have to tell you something...

636
00:38:50,584 --> 00:38:51,044
Yeah?

637
00:38:52,644 --> 00:38:53,684
I'm pregnant.
