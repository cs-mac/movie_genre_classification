1
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,121
<i>Technically speaking, I'm an alien.</i>

2
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,728
<i>And from the perspective of Immigration,
an illegal one.</i>

3
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,562
<i>My parents met at the university
in Saint Petersburg...</i>

4
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,121
<i>...where he taught Astrophysics...</i>

5
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,607
<i>...and she taught Applied Mathematics.</i>

6
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,642
<i>My mother fell in love with him
when she found him almost frozen to death...</i>

7
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,928
<i>...on the bank of the Neva,
staring at the stars.</i>

8
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,603
Tonight, the sky is
completely full of miracles.

9
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,800
<i>My mother won't talk much...</i>

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,161
<i>...about that time.</i>

11
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,928
<i>- But my aunt Nino told me about my father.</i>
- Max...

12
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,200
<i>His name was...</i>

13
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,287
<i>...Maximilian Jones.</i>

14
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,608
<i>And he was the son of
an English diplomat...</i>

15
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,764
<i>...who always saw the best in people.</i>

16
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,247
<i>I often wonder if what happened
to my mother and father...</i>

17
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,050
<i>...changed me from someone
who might have seen the best...</i>

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,765
<i>...in people...</i>

19
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,208
<i>...to someone
who always expects the worst.</i>

20
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,048
How's my Jupiter?

21
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,640
Not a planet, the planet.

22
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,925
The biggest and most beautiful planet
in our solar system.

23
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,570
She is our Jupiter.

24
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,691
Over my dead body
we will name her "Jupiter."

25
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,246
Soon you will discover...

26
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,922
...that your mother can be
extraordinarily unreasonable at times.

27
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,566
- Hm.
- But fortunately...

28
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,805
...for us, she remains susceptible
to your father's particular...

29
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,082
- Heh-heh.
- ...charm.

30
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,409
No, oh, no!

31
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,091
Not the telescope, please!

32
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,082
Don't take the telescope...

33
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,320
...Please!

34
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,248
Max! Max!

35
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,280
<i>In her grief...</i>

36
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,569
<i>...my mother pushed everyone
except her sister out of her life.</i>

37
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,247
<i>Somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic...</i>

38
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,767
<i>...she pushed me out too.</i>

39
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,969
<i>I was born without a country.</i>

40
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,531
<i>Without a home.</i>

41
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,001
<i>Without a father.</i>

42
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,361
<i>But I was born...</i>

43
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,647
<i>...in the House of Leo...</i>

44
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,611
<i>...with Jupiter rising
at 23 degrees ascendant.</i>

45
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,370
<i>According to my aunt...</i>

46
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,161
<i>...this is supposed to mean
that I am destined for great things...</i>

47
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,405
<i>...and that I will find
the one true love of my life.</i>

48
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,525
Jupiter?

49
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,800
Coming!

50
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,760
- You finish the bathroom yet?
- Not yet.

51
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:16,683
We still have...

52
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,843
- ...another house tonight.
- I'll be fast.

53
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,525
<i>The problem with astrology?</i>

54
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,131
<i>Total bullshit.</i>

55
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,491
What was the name of this planet?

56
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,081
Zalintyre, I think.

57
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,531
Have you ever seen a harvest?

58
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,170
Oh, no. Never.

59
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,171
But I've heard they feel no pain.

60
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,246
It's all quite humane,
from what I've been told.

61
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,525
There are administrators to make sure
everything is done according to code, but still...

62
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,764
...it can be rather...

63
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
...affecting.

64
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,486
Now you sound like Mother.

65
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,602
Most of them were miserable
in their lives...

66
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,047
...and what we do for them is a mercy.

67
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,682
Balem, thank you for responding.
We were just admiring...

68
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,281
...this ledger from your latest success.

69
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,521
Well done, brother.

70
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,166
The House of Abrasax...

71
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,765
...continues to thrive...

72
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,843
...despite the squandering
of your inheritance.

73
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,047
I must say, you're looking
a little worse for wear.

74
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,282
Could it be success
does not agree with you?

75
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,521
And you look so well.

76
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,645
Could it be that failure agrees with you?

77
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,091
You may have inherited Mother's head
for business, but I inherited her heart.

78
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,486
What does that leave me?

79
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,720
Her beauty.

80
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,920
Liar.

81
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,081
Her humour.

82
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,243
Her unluckiness in love?

83
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,766
Her fetish for wrinkles.

84
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,367
If this is to be another
of your eulogies, Titus...

85
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,807
...I have more important matters to attend.

86
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,969
It was her birthday recently.

87
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,249
I get sentimental. I was going through
Mother's old sheave-work...

88
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,563
...and I came across a description
of a planet she claimed...

89
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,447
...was the most rare and beautiful estate
she ever owned.

90
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,410
I believe she named it...

91
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,047
Earth.

92
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,886
Earth. It was part of your inheritance,
wasn't it?

93
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,040
I was moved by her description
and I was wondering...

94
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,891
...if there was any chance
you might be willing to part with it.

95
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,322
Titus...

96
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,562
...didn't you bother
to look at the sheaves?

97
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,610
That planet is worth more than
all of your estates combined.

98
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,125
Really?
I had no idea.

99
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,603
Kalique.

100
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,445
Balem.

101
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,411
Jupiter, get up.

102
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,891
Get up.

103
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,040
Jupiter. Make the coffee. Come on.

104
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,680
Oh, I hate my life.

105
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,000
Jupiter, hurry up.

106
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,280
That one goes next to...

107
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,360
...that one.

108
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,240
Jupiter.

109
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,680
Get the garbage after this.

110
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,771
- Have you finished the bathroom?
- No.

111
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,960
Jupiter!

112
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,846
I hate my life.

113
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,926
Damn it.

114
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,604
Told you.

115
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,331
Lycantant.

116
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,690
- Another Hunter.
And ex-Legion.

117
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,445
He was a Skyjacker.

118
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,531
How do you know that?

119
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,920
The boots.

120
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,881
There was a Hunter in the Legion.

121
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,120
A legend.

122
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,926
Could track a single gene in the Gyre.

123
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,522
No matter who or what he is...

124
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,609
...he's after our bounty.

125
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,205
That's him.
It's got to be.

126
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,482
We should warn Lord Balem.

127
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,563
That is what we should do...

128
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,249
...but do you trust me?

129
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,802
This matter must be handled with delicacy.

130
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,764
I understand, Lady Kalique.

131
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,609
Neither Balem nor Titus
must suspect my involvement.

132
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,649
Of course, Your Majesty.

133
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,567
You believe the Hunters can be trusted?

134
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,405
Trust is an illusion, my lady.

135
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,160
I believe only in mutual self-interest.

136
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,529
They want another life. We can offer it.

137
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,885
Make the deal.

138
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,960
Welcome back, Lord Balem.

139
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,567
It has been too long.

140
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:51,285
I have not crossed the vastness of space
for your pleasantries, Mr. Night.

141
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,324
Of course, my lord.

142
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,643
We have verified the geneprint.

143
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,810
Most unfortunate news.

144
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,202
I believe Titus is aware of the Recurrence.

145
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,082
My spies whisper, but cannot substantiate.

146
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,881
So you have her print,
but you don't have her?

147
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,960
Mr. Tskalikan?

148
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,608
The Keepers traced the print
to a medical clinic.

149
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,161
They're eliminating every lead.

150
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,165
We have a name. Dunlevy.

151
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,323
Katherine Dunlevy.

152
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,323
Well, I want Miss Dunlevy found...

153
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,928
...and I want her dead.

154
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,207
Black. Classic?

155
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,566
À la mode? À la...

156
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,370
- No.
- Katherine, I'm done.

157
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,769
Jupiter! Help, please?

158
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,683
Wow...

159
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,920
...what's the occasion?

160
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,962
Austin Davis is taking me to dinner.

161
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,441
I think he's gonna ask me to marry him.

162
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,680
Do you wanna marry him?

163
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:51,128
Jupiter, he's the number eight richest
bachelor under 30 in America.

164
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,010
He speaks fluent Chinese and German.

165
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,567
He was an alternate
on the Olympic curling team.

166
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,600
Solid résumé.

167
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,684
Yeah. I mean, it sounds
totally Cinderella, doesn't it?

168
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,007
Sure.

169
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,164
Then why do I feel like
I'm about to throw up? Oh, God.

170
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,881
I just don't remember Cinderella puking.

171
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,885
I kind of remember her
dancing with a bunch of mice.

172
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,166
Have you ever...

173
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,880
...fallen in love, Jupiter?

174
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,641
You know, my mom says that love
is just a fairy tale for little girls.

175
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,321
That really...

176
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,962
...it's all just urges and obligations.

177
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,129
Wow, that's kind of harsh.

178
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,400
You want my advice?

179
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,204
- Yes.
- If he's really...

180
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,487
...in love with you...

181
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,088
...then he'll understand
that you're just overwhelmed...

182
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,685
...and you need a little time.

183
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,042
- That makes sense.
- Yeah.

184
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,280
What do I wear now?

185
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,360
Something that...

186
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,086
...reminds him of what he is waiting for.
Like that red McQueen...

187
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,122
...or this little Ricci.

188
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,291
Oh, my...

189
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,849
Katherine? Everything all right?

190
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,326
Yeah. No, no, we're good.

191
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,449
I'll be down in a sec.

192
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,771
Picked up a referral. A townhouse.
But it has to be Wednesday.

193
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,843
Wednesday's full. Three houses.

194
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,526
So do four.

195
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,961
- Use English in this house.
- Use whatever you like.

196
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,480
You sound like Stalin to me.

197
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,841
Stalin? I'm Stalin?

198
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,121
You don't want the money.

199
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,408
I will give it to, uh, Gleb's crew.

200
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,840
Good.

201
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,166
Thank you.

202
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,441
We'll take it.

203
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,406
- Big surprise.
- Cousin, speaking of money...

204
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,720
- ...I was wondering if...
- Oh, let me guess.

205
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,925
Another advance.
For what this time? Shoes?

206
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,241
A new phone?

207
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,202
- I'll earn it back.
Ha-ha.

208
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:24,161
You'll waste it trying to make yourself feel
better buying something you don't need.

209
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:29,448
So instead of feeling better,
I should save my money and feel worse?

210
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,806
Exactly.

211
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,610
You are a smart girl, Jupiter.

212
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,649
I admit it's none of my business...

213
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,000
...but that's probably the reason
you are not married.

214
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,280
Men do not like smart women.

215
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,209
Keep talking about my daughter like that...

216
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,160
...I'll ram that latke
so far up your ass...

217
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,120
English.

218
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,964
Hey, hey. hey.

219
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,441
You swore, no fighting at dinner.

220
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:57,526
Jupiter, what is the money for?

221
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,245
No, you're right.
It's nothing I need.

222
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,926
Hey, what was that about?

223
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,160
Not having second thoughts?

224
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,930
What if I am?

225
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,405
Jupiter...

226
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,650
...these people, they're counting on you.

227
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,729
Have you even looked at this thing?

228
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,561
Why do they have to use words
like "harvesting"? It's just creepy.

229
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,451
Why would you read this?
You heard what the doctor said.

230
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,247
It's not a big deal.

231
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,245
You go in, cash comes out.

232
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,522
This money, I'm telling you,
I have real plans...

233
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,325
...serious plans.

234
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,523
I believe this money's
gonna mean something...

235
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,240
...possibly life-changing for both of us.

236
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,320
Okay.

237
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,250
- Okay.
- You will not regret this.

238
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,208
All right.

239
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,163
I promise.

240
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,767
- I promise.
- All right. Wait, I have a question.

241
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,971
Why do you get 10 grand...

242
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,964
...and I get 5? They're not your eggs.

243
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,209
That's capitalism, babe.

244
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,168
Shit rolls downhill.

245
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,482
Profits flow up.

246
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,764
Ms. Dunlevy?

247
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,326
Excuse me.

248
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,449
You are Katherine Dunlevy, aren't you?

249
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,121
The doctor is ready.

250
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,890
- I think something's wrong.
- It's the hormones...

251
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,610
<i>- ...dear.
- Don't worry.</i>

252
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,602
You'll be fine.

253
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,840
Trust me, honey.

254
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,207
I could do this procedure
with my eyes closed.

255
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,687
No, no, no! Please. Please, I can't!

256
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,920
Just relax.

257
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,960
I can't move my arms.

258
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,490
What's happening?

259
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,763
- Stop. What are you doing?
- Get a sample.

260
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,320
Make sure this is the right one.

261
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,406
Wait, stop. Please!

262
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,051
Please, stop!

263
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,040
It's her.

264
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,645
Good. Kill her.

265
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,689
Please, please!

266
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,086
Stop. Please help me.

267
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,725
Oh, my God!

268
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,160
You all right?

269
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,961
Who are you?

270
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,850
Caine Wise. I'm here to help you.

271
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,445
Pardon me, Lord Titus.

272
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,160
Only good news is allowed in here,
Famulus.

273
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,041
We received an FTL from Mr. Wise.
He says he has the girl.

274
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,971
Brilliant.

275
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,884
Then send the transport immediately.

276
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,529
At once, my lord.

277
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,520
Thought it would make you
feel better when you woke up.

278
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,051
- What?
- The gun.

279
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,687
It works better if you flip the switch
by your thumb.

280
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,770
Careful. You've been asleep
for almost 12 hours.

281
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,480
Where am I?

282
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,841
You're still in Chicago.

283
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,929
Okay, good.

284
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,124
- My clothes?
- Um, you were still in...

285
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,407
...the paper clinic gown.

286
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,008
- Uh-uh. Can't really think about that right now.
- Look...

287
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,401
...Jupiter...

288
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,404
...is that your name?

289
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,082
- How do you know?
- I'm sorry.

290
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,408
Just trying to figure out what happened.

291
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,364
You must have used a false name...

292
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,450
...and their tests tripped the Monitor
to your geneprint.

293
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,491
What are you saying?
I mean, yes, I used a false name...

294
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,643
...but lots of people do that in there.

295
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,928
What does that have to do
with what happened?

296
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:14,080
Okay. When I was in the Legion,
they gave me Protocols for this.

297
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,125
It can be...

298
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,682
...difficult for Terrsies, or people
from underdeveloped worlds...

299
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,681
...to hear that their planet is not
the only inhabited planet in the Verse.

300
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,361
Has to be the anaesthesia.

301
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,250
I mean, it's gotta be a dream.

302
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,485
The Protocol actually says that most Terrsies
will say that this has to be a dream.

303
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,684
Yeah, because a dream is the only way
any of this makes sense.

304
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,081
Compared to what?

305
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,529
The idea that
you're the only intelligent species...

306
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,481
...on the only inhabitable planet
in a universe so full of planets...

307
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,451
...you don't have a number
to describe how many there are?

308
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,284
Are you saying you're an alien?

309
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,045
Genomgineered human.

310
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,961
They cut my DNA with the DNA
of something like a wolf. I'm a Lycantant.

311
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,129
Bred for the military...

312
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,044
...but that didn't work out for me.

313
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,810
And those things at the clinic?

314
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,280
Keepers.

315
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,886
They're from the Diorite System,
but they're genetically repurposed...

316
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,884
...to act as Monitors and watchdogs.

317
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,362
And they're trying to kill me?

318
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,447
- Yes.
- Why me?

319
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,008
Please. This has to be a mistake.

320
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,882
These people don't make
those kind of mistakes.

321
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,121
What if I say no? What if I don't
go with you? What if I go home?

322
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,322
What? Are they gonna
come after me again?

323
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,488
An FTL, my lord.

324
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,683
There was...

325
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,002
...a problem at the clinic.
A former Legionnaire...

326
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,726
...was involved.

327
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,445
A Legionnaire?

328
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,681
What about the girl?

329
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,291
Still alive.

330
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,686
Double our security deployment.
Destroy any ship that comes near the planet.

331
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,480
Go!

332
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,080
Wow.

333
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:09,803
Are those...

334
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,040
...flying boots?

335
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,406
They use the force of gravity...

336
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,803
...redirecting it into deferential
equation slopes that you can surf.

337
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,085
Yeah. I heard "gravity" and "surf."

338
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,171
Up is hard. Down is easy.

339
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,084
Thank you. Wow.

340
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,920
Our ride's here.

341
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,406
You ready?

342
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,206
Ready?

343
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,401
Ready to walk out of a 100-story window
with you and your gravity boots onto...

344
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,045
This might make it easier.

345
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,327
Oh! Okay.

346
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,251
Sorry.

347
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,681
Oh, shit.

348
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,240
- Hold tight!
- Aah!

349
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,760
Hold on.

350
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,851
Whatever you do, don't let go.

351
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,441
No!

352
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,326
I just need to know what in the hell
is going on here.

353
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,404
We might have stumbled into a war
within the Abrasax family.

354
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,211
The Abrasax family?

355
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,568
One of the most powerful dynasties
in the universe.

356
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,880
I don't care who they are.

357
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,049
You can't just blow up a bunch of buildings
and get away with it.

358
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,282
Those buildings will be rebuilt by tonight.

359
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,244
That's impossible.

360
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,965
Take a look.

361
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,281
Holy crap.

362
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,560
But a bunch of...

363
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,171
...people saw what happened.
They can't cover that up.

364
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,643
You have a picture of a Keeper on your phone
you can't remember taking, can you?

365
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,768
They blanked you. Short-term stuff is easy.

366
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,407
They won't get everybody,
but no one believes the ones...

367
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,041
...that slip through the cracks.
- Oh, my God.

368
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,484
Why is this happening to me?

369
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,080
I asked Titus that question
before I took this job.

370
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,129
All he'd tell me is it was personal.

371
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,011
This is ridiculous.
I have never even met...

372
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,527
...this Titus... What's his name?
- Abrasax.

373
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,603
The House of Abrasax has three...

374
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,889
...primary heirs. The oldest is Balem.
He's the one...

375
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,884
...that controls this planet and is...

376
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,441
...the one who wants you dead.
- That's insane.

377
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,364
I am telling you, I am nobody.

378
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,807
Balem Abrasax wouldn't demolish
an entire city for a nobody.

379
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,326
<i>Kill her.</i>

380
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,971
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

381
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,726
<i>Stop. Wait, wait! Please stop it.</i>

382
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,651
<i>Please stop! Please help me!</i>

383
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,284
Slow.

384
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,527
There you are.

385
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,644
You know, there are moments...

386
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,565
...when I actually miss you.

387
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:43,525
But no one understands this universe
like you did.

388
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,965
No one understands me...

389
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,650
...like you did.

390
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,808
Mr. Tskalikan?

391
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,930
How is it possible...

392
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,970
...for a single Splice
to destroy an entire...

393
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,004
...fleet of Shadows?

394
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,249
It was a mistake.

395
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,851
A mistake?

396
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,965
They underestimated him.

397
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,208
The next mistake...

398
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,442
...I hold you accountable.

399
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,201
What are you doing?

400
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,520
I want the owner of this car
to know who borrowed it.

401
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,206
We needed a low profile
to get out of the city.

402
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,361
Oh, my God.

403
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:46,640
You're bleeding.

404
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,042
Don't worry about it.

405
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,521
- It's fine.
- Lucky for you...

406
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,125
...a woman...

407
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,606
...owns this car.

408
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,320
What is that?

409
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,360
Is that a...?

410
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,161
I just... I wanna thank you...

411
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,722
...for saving my life.

412
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,281
I've never been so scared
when I started falling.

413
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,802
Then you were there and...

414
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,203
Do you do this sort of thing a lot?

415
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,160
No.

416
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,161
Then why did Titus hire you?

417
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,323
Titus hired me because
I'm good at finding people.

418
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,527
Are you taking me to him now?

419
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,125
No.

420
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,609
How do you know this guy?

421
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,326
A long time ago, he was a friend.

422
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,604
What is he doing living way out here?

423
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,848
He's a Marshall for the Aegis.

424
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,366
The Aegis?

425
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,409
They're like cops.

426
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,360
Space cops. Sure.

427
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,411
Stinger.

428
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,087
Back from the goddamn dead.

429
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,566
It's kind of funny, both of us
ending up on this planet.

430
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,320
"Funny" ain't the word I'd use.

431
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,485
How'd you get out'?

432
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,161
Titus Abrasax.
He hired me to lift her.

433
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,081
Since Deadland ain't taught you
a damn thing...

434
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,608
Just as I was getting used to this life...

435
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,646
...you come back reminding me
what I flushed down the shitter for you.

436
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,167
Where's Kiza?
She used to at least listen...

437
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,807
- ...to my side.
- You stay away from my daughter.

438
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,082
Don't drag me into your male mating...

439
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,360
...rituals.

440
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,610
Hi. I'm Kiza.

441
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,171
Hi.

442
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,245
Jupiter. Nice to meet you.

443
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:14,929
You used to have...

444
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:15,888
...mettle in you.

445
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,849
I guess I'm getting a little old.

446
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:21,368
Old? Look at me. Not a recode
or a drop of Juice in years.

447
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,880
You are a lot uglier...

448
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,040
...than I remember.

449
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,011
Hey!

450
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,881
Hey!

451
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,567
What is going on here?

452
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,011
Your Majesty.

453
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,650
Your Majesty.

454
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,247
Uh, thank you.

455
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,120
I'll go to town to pick up
some groceries for dinner.

456
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,288
- I'll go.
- I'm fine, Dad.

457
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,646
Okay. All right.

458
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,723
Let's have a look at you.

459
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,527
It's not pretty, is it?

460
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,884
Clipped and stripped.
The mark of a court-martialled Skyjacker.

461
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,288
You haven't answered my question.
Do you want your wings back...

462
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,520
...or not?

463
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,086
Wait, you had wings?

464
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:50,210
The best bio-neural-synaptic prosthetic
the military could buy.

465
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,962
Oh, my God. That's amazing.

466
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:10,245
Your Majesty has no idea of the scientific
miracles that human beings are capable of.

467
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,161
Why won't those human beings
share things...

468
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:13,969
...like this?

469
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:18,006
Sharing has never been the strong suit
of your species, Your Majesty.

470
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:18,729
Okay...

471
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,480
...what is with this "Your Majesty" thing?

472
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,281
You've never been stung by a bee,
have you?

473
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,520
No.

474
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:29,690
You know, bees are genetically designed
to recognise royalty.

475
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,360
Royalty?

476
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,840
Wow.

477
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,801
You are in for a surprise
when you find out what I do for a living.

478
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,087
It's not what you do...

479
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,970
...it's what you are.

480
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,083
They sense it.

481
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,011
Bees aren't like humans.
They don't question or doubt.

482
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,284
Bees don't lie.

483
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,323
Oh, I...

484
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,688
Sorry, I gotta take this.

485
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,647
I'm guessing Titus
didn't say anything about it.

486
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:05,041
- No. Must have slipped his mind.
- Not easy to picture...

487
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,009
...you making a deal with a Royal.

488
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,447
Titus told me you were posted to this planet,
and said if I helped him...

489
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,610
...he'd get you your wings back,
full Reinstatement.

490
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,764
I figured I owed you.

491
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,365
Yeah, you do.

492
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,401
But if she is a Recurrence...

493
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,805
...then this is a hell of a lot
more important than wings.

494
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:32,529
<i>- It's life-changing, Jupiter.
- Wait till you see this thing.</i>

495
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:36,162
Two million pixels of resolution.

496
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,765
It's everything I ever wanted.

497
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,570
That's great.
Um, is Mom there?

498
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,087
No, she went out with Nino.

499
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,971
They were a little freaked out
when you didn't come home.

500
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,611
<i>I covered, I think it's fine.</i>

501
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,487
How about a little gratitude for your cousin?
This was a cakewalk, right?

502
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,207
Just like I said,
easiest money we ever made. Chi-ching!

503
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,841
It didn't happen.

504
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,526
Ha. "It didn't happen."

505
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,561
- What?
<i>- No, I know. I'm so sorry.</i>

506
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,689
- Oh, no.
<i>- I'm really, really sorry.</i>

507
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,366
<i>- Why?</i>
- There was an accident at the clinic.

508
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,564
<i>Someone got hurt.</i>

509
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,684
Shit! I knew it!

510
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,400
Oh, my God, I knew it.
I can't catch a break.

511
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,290
<i>I cannot catch a single break!</i>

512
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,885
Look, I'm with some people.

513
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,080
<i>- I don't wanna be rude.</i>
- We have to reschedule.

514
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,481
Totally. Tell Mom I'm okay...

515
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,371
<i>- ...and I will call her when I can.</i>
- Wait! Jupe, Jupe?

516
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,011
I already spent the money.

517
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,205
You're in trouble.

518
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,764
You're in trouble.

519
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,365
Don't touch my stuff!

520
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,809
Balem ordered a blockade.
Nothing is getting on or off this planet.

521
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,883
Aegis Command said
once her geneprint...

522
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:56,329
...is verified, they'll get an injunction
to take us to Orous.

523
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,881
- So we wait.
- They're sending a Cruiser.

524
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,685
- When?
- Should be here tomorrow.

525
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,771
We won't last the night.

526
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,371
We need a plan.

527
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,409
We need firepower.

528
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,608
If she's what you say she is...

529
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,760
...we won't get off this planet
without a fight.

530
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,244
Stash is in the back.

531
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,804
Is he mad at me?

532
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,485
When he's mad, you'll know it.

533
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,091
He just...

534
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,291
...seems different since we got here.

535
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,450
Caine is...

536
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,291
...complicated.

537
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,565
He's a Lycantant without a pack.

538
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,801
<i>Had the bad luck...</i>

539
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,764
<i>...to be born half-albino.</i>

540
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,610
<i>Runt of the litter.</i>

541
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:50,403
The Splicer that bred him had to sell him
to the Legion for a loss.

542
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,043
But a Lycantant needs a pack.

543
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,363
It's their centre of gravity.

544
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,441
<i>Alone...</i>

545
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,524
<i>...usually they waste away and die...</i>

546
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,804
<i>...unless they become like him.</i>

547
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,371
<i>Fearless.</i>

548
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,766
<i>Relentless.</i>

549
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,441
<i>Perfect hunting machines.</i>

550
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,088
Caine was the best soldier
I ever went into battle with.

551
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,562
Why did he get court-martialled?

552
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,121
I'm sorry.

553
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,646
It's none of my business.

554
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,929
He attacked someone.
He attacked an Entitled.

555
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,850
He bit him.

556
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,645
He bit him?

557
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,446
Tore his throat out.

558
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,369
There's something about the Royals
for Caine. It's instinctual.

559
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,246
They tried to put him down,
but he was...

560
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,960
...under my command so I took the blame.

561
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,525
Two scars across my back as a reward.

562
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,680
You both have marks
on your neck, but they're...

563
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,365
...slightly different.

564
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,762
The brand of the Splicer.

565
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:29,091
Marcellian Cahun was her name.
She loved bees.

566
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,046
Wow.

567
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,928
My father would be freaking out right now.

568
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:35,563
Do you know...

569
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:39,043
...what this will do to people
when they find out the truth?

570
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:44,048
I don't think that most people
would want to know the truth.

571
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,765
I do.

572
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:48,800
Okay.

573
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:52,288
So you've been taught that the birthplace
of the human race is Earth...

574
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:53,681
...but it's not.

575
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,645
It's actually a planet
in the Cunabulum System...

576
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:57,920
...called Orous...

577
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:01,328
...a little over a billion
of your years ago.

578
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:05,281
Your planet was discovered during what is
commonly called The Great Expansion.

579
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,047
Ah.

580
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:09,840
At the time...

581
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:13,328
...Earth was inhabited
by a branch-species of Saurisapian...

582
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,411
...a dangerous human predator
called a Sargorn.

583
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,803
Obviously before any colonisation
or resource development...

584
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,963
...could be done safely to your planet...

585
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,210
...a large-scale extinction event
was manufactured...

586
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,926
Damn budget cuts.

587
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:31,205
Are you talking about dinosaurs?

588
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,440
Mm-hm.

589
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,566
Wait, are you saying your people
killed the dinosaurs?

590
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,371
Technically, they're your people, Majesty.

591
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,400
Come on.

592
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,762
According to Commonwealth records...

593
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,401
...this planet was seeded
by Abrasax Industries...

594
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,768
...roughly 100,000 years ago.

595
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:13,566
Human DNA
spliced with indigenous species...

596
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,802
...to evolve a fertile population.

597
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,205
That's where the why gets ugly.
Basically...

598
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,523
...the goal is to grow a population
as large as possible.

599
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,643
Once the population exceeds...

600
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,400
...the planet's ability to sustain it...

601
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:31,163
...it's considered ripe for harvest.

602
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,320
Harvest?

603
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,360
What's going on?

604
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,883
What's wrong with them?

605
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,925
They're here.

606
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,571
- Go.
- Come on.

607
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,323
Caine.

608
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,891
Wait, Caine!

609
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,080
Caine!

610
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,447
Beeswax.

611
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Gotcha.

612
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:39,684
Mr. Night...

613
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,685
...I want this facility
running at capacity.

614
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,321
I want full diagnostics
and cost projections...

615
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:46,766
...for an early harvest.

616
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,040
Of course, my lord.

617
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,726
What kind of grade
are we getting from the Skim?

618
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,650
Excellent product, sire.

619
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:53,920
Premium grade.

620
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:59,441
It's a, um, particularly robust stock.

621
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:05,128
Assuming market stability,
if we harvest later this century...

622
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,930
...profit margins should eclipse...

623
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,128
...your nearest competitor.

624
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:14,007
Understand this, Mr. Night.

625
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,805
I will harvest that planet tomorrow...

626
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,083
...before I let her take it from me.

627
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,691
Here we go.

628
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,049
I trust you.

629
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:03,969
Premium...

630
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,322
...Abrasax, as requested.

631
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:16,887
Now...

632
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,930
...where is Her Majesty?

633
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,240
<i>Good evening, Your Majesty.</i>

634
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,087
<i>Allow me to assist.</i>

635
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,810
- Oh.
<i>- I am Sendi...</i>

636
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:38,407
<i>- ...your Chamber Presence.</i>
- New clothes?

637
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:39,801
<i>We wish only to attend...</i>

638
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:40,723
<i>...your needs.</i>

639
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,371
Where am I?

640
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,285
<i>This is the alcazar of Kalique Abrasax...</i>

641
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,682
<i>...Second Primary of the House of Abrasax.</i>

642
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,089
What's an alcazar?

643
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:51,890
A fancy way of saying my home.

644
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:54,971
I'm Kalique.

645
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,530
Jupiter Jones.

646
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,320
I'm sorry...

647
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:03,080
...for staring, but it's quite astonishing.

648
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,171
What is?

649
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,887
It will be easier to show you.

650
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,887
Could this get any weirder?

651
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,564
Imagine it for me.

652
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:23,241
Meeting your mother
long after she's passed away.

653
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:24,925
But I'm not your mother.

654
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:30,047
Your planet is just now
entering its Genetic Age.

655
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:34,285
You understand very little about something
which is a vital part of our reality.

656
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:37,280
In our world...

657
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,802
...genes have an almost
spiritual significance.

658
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,883
They are the seeds of our immortality.

659
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:44,880
When the exact...

660
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,331
...same genes reappear...

661
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:49,001
...in the exact same order...

662
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:51,686
...it is for us what you
would call reincarnation.

663
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:55,811
But how could I be a reincarnation of your
mother unless your mother was from Earth?

664
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,327
My mother was born
before your first cities were built.

665
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,769
Are you some kind of vampire race?

666
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,891
We are the cause
of a lot of those myths, but I promise...

667
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,407
...my mother was just as human as you or I.

668
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:14,769
The difference between us
is our knowledge and technology.

669
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:16,643
How old do you think...

670
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,365
...I am?
- Um...

671
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:20,446
Late forties?

672
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,726
I recently celebrated my 14th millennium.

673
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:27,446
You're 14,000 years old?

674
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:30,610
Fourteen thousand and four, to be precise.

675
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:35,006
My mother was approaching
her 91st millennium when she passed.

676
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,728
You'd be just as amazed
how quickly it goes.

677
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,924
If your lives are so long...

678
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,242
...could I ask
how your mother actually died?

679
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,689
She was murdered.

680
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:51,529
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

681
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:55,643
- Did they ever find out who did it?
- No.

682
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:58,162
My mother and I did not always get along.

683
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,411
I hope this Recurrence might mean
a second chance for both of us.

684
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,080
Come.

685
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,682
Let me introduce you
to the possibilities of your new life.

686
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,400
Holy crap.

687
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:16,803
Each of us has...

688
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,880
...a code for our optimal
physical condition.

689
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:20,600
The problem is...

690
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,809
...our genes have an expiration date
which is transferred to our cells.

691
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,128
A long time ago, someone figured out...

692
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,442
...how to replace deteriorating cells
with new ones.

693
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,007
Today, it's as easy as
changing a light bulb.

694
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:33,244
Where do you get these light bulbs?

695
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:34,720
You grow them.

696
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,127
Like clones?

697
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:37,407
No.

698
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,728
Clones lack genetic plasticity.

699
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,360
Several million years ago,
a gene plague caused by cloning...

700
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:45,284
...nearly annihilated
the entire human race.

701
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,527
I was told that the House of Abrasax
seeded the Earth.

702
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:51,851
Is that where you get it?

703
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:56,728
Your Earth is a very small part
of a very large industry.

704
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,725
Feel my skin.

705
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,291
Wow.

706
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:07,922
In your world, people are used to
fighting for resources...

707
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,049
...like oil, or minerals, or land.

708
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,486
But when you have access
to the vastness of space...

709
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,809
...you realise there's only one resource
worth fighting over...

710
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:19,288
...even killing for:

711
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,366
More time.

712
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,685
Time is the single most
precious commodity...

713
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,206
...in the universe.

714
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:34,400
<i>Unidentified Lycantant.</i>

715
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,723
<i>Unidentified Lycantant.</i>

716
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:37,649
<i>Unidentified...</i>

717
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:39,450
<i>...Lycantant.</i>

718
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:54,651
Sorry, I just don't understand what you mean
when you say "claim your Title."

719
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,769
It's common for people
in the First Estate...

720
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,651
...to leave a trust
for any potential Recurrence.

721
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:03,330
My mother wrote her future
self into her will.

722
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:07,369
Right now, Balem owns the Title to Earth...

723
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:11,366
...but once you claim it,
the Earth will belong to you.

724
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,001
How can one person own the Earth?

725
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:17,481
It's just a planet, Jupiter.

726
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,447
In this world, people own things
far more valuable.

727
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:23,963
You cannot know what it will be like...

728
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,567
...when you're offered
wealth beyond your imagining.

729
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:29,525
When you can choose
to remain young and beautiful...

730
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:33,691
...or when you can have the power to change
the lives of your family for the better.

731
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:36,691
And all you have to do is close your eyes.

732
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:52,766
Caine.

733
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,440
This must be the Hunter Titus hired.

734
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,240
- Well-made, by the look of him.
- Whoa!

735
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,441
No, no, no. Hey, hey!

736
00:57:58,680 --> 00:57:59,363
It's okay.

737
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:00,880
- She's on our side.
- Abrasax...

738
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,200
...don't know any side but their own.

739
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:03,965
Precisely. And since...

740
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:06,362
...Jupiter is an Abrasax,
you understand why...

741
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,171
...I helped her get off that planet.
- He contacted the Aegis.

742
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:10,400
They are entering...

743
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:11,560
...orbit now.

744
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:13,480
Excellent.

745
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:17,127
I had planned to take you myself...

746
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,600
...but the Aegis will insist...

747
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,928
...they handle things from here.

748
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:26,530
I wish for you
the life you've always dreamed of.

749
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,403
Welcome aboard, Your Majesty. My name...

750
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,200
...is Diomika Tsing, captain of this...

751
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:36,969
...Aegis Cruiser.

752
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,000
- Please call me Jupe.
- Your Majesty.

753
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:41,120
Stinger.

754
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:43,243
- You're all right. Oh.
- For the time being...

755
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:45,881
...Your Majesty. For the time being.

756
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:46,729
We'll escort you...

757
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:51,005
...to the Commonwealth Ministry. Anything we
can do to make the journey easier, let us know.

758
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,521
Actually, I'm feeling a little overdressed.

759
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,643
If you maybe have something
I can change into.

760
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:57,926
By myself.

761
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,769
While I'm awake.

762
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:02,440
What?

763
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,963
No! No!

764
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,123
Lord Balem!

765
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:13,483
It was the Hunters!
They betrayed you in the name...

766
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,324
...of your sister!

767
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:19,087
Please! Mercy, my lord!

768
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:20,360
Mercy!

769
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:26,603
Mr. Greeghan.

770
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:29,848
Bring her to me.

771
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:33,087
Yes, my lord.

772
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:37,565
Come in.

773
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:42,607
I don't really... Oh, I don't really know
how to work this thing. Oh.

774
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,969
Hi. Come in.

775
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,009
Your Majesty might want to take these.

776
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,686
Portalling can be a little rough
on the royal bowels.

777
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,006
Well, my bowels are anything but royal.
Heh-heh-heh.

778
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:57,929
Thank you.

779
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:00,045
You heard the lady down there.

780
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:01,606
You're an Abrasax now.

781
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:02,602
No, no...

782
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:05,161
...I'm a Jones.
Well, except when I'm mad.

783
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:08,688
- Then I'm a Bolotnikov.
- If that's all you were, you would not be...

784
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:11,486
...on an Aegis Cruiser
headed to the Hall of Titles.

785
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,729
Yeah, um...

786
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,765
Stinger said that you attacked
an Entitled once.

787
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,563
- Stinger talks too much.
- Is it true?

788
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:23,840
Does it matter?

789
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:29,406
Sorry, I get it's none of my business.

790
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:31,444
I was just trying to understand.

791
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:35,210
Truth is, I don't know why I did it.

792
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,406
I don't even remember doing it.
It just happened.

793
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:42,682
We all do things we can't explain.

794
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,000
They said it was...

795
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,044
...in my genes.

796
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:51,643
- A defect of my genomgineering.
- Hm.

797
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:54,611
Could explain a lot of things about me.

798
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,891
Like the fact that I have
an uncanny ability...

799
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:03,203
...to fall for men that don't fall for me.

800
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:06,247
It's like my internal
compass needle points...

801
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,209
...straight at Mr. Wrong.

802
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:11,001
Maybe it's my genes.

803
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:15,683
Maybe I have defective engineering too.

804
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,642
And if that's the case...

805
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,521
...is there any way to fix it?

806
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,647
You are royalty now.

807
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:27,640
I'm a Splice. You don't...

808
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:30,161
...understand what that means...

809
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,846
...but I have more in common with a dog
than I have with you.

810
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:36,007
I love dogs.
I've always loved dogs.

811
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:41,686
- I should go, Your Majesty.
- Right.

812
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:42,529
Strap in...

813
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:45,770
- ...before we portal.
- Right, okay.

814
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:49,683
"I love dogs"?

815
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:51,280
Huh.

816
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:29,767
Welcome, Your Majesty,
to the overpopulated, oozing cesspool...

817
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,923
...we humbly call home.

818
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:46,926
I did three tours in Abukesh, a battle
that cost the lives of 2 million soldiers.

819
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,929
Rather be back there than have to deal...

820
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,326
...with these bureaucrats.

821
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:52,325
Greetings, Your Majesty.

822
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,244
I am Intergalactic Advocate Bob...

823
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,960
...here to assist you
through the Ascension Process.

824
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:06,960
Sheave.

825
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,170
This is the authentic Recurrence...

826
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:12,400
...of Her Ladyship...

827
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:13,641
...the Abrasax Sovereign...

828
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:16,287
...and we have come to claim her Title.

829
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:19,242
You need to file an Inheritance Petition.

830
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:21,484
If the Title is held, you'll need...

831
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:23,165
...a transfer of Title.

832
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,445
Thank you.

833
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,685
File a Quit Claim through Central Services,
Section 918.

834
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:32,321
Next.

835
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:33,766
You need a Title Survey...

836
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:37,089
...and geneprint identification
from Wills and Trusts.

837
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:46,920
I can't touch this without a Tax Number...

838
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,962
...from the Revenue Review.

839
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:01,883
This is Revenue Request,
not Revenue Review.

840
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:14,125
We can't get the Title without the Tax ID.

841
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,280
It goes without saying that...

842
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:36,370
...graft is incompatible
with my programming.

843
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,000
I think you dropped something.

844
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:45,366
Press your thumb in the depression.

845
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:53,048
Seals and Signets...

846
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:54,446
...are on Sub-33.

847
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:57,929
Your Majesty.

848
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:09,080
Well, well, well.

849
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:16,171
This is what I have to deal with.

850
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:18,405
Yeah, yeah. Good.

851
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:41,369
Oh, yeah.

852
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:43,166
Yeah.

853
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:50,164
Yeah, very nice.

854
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:51,965
Would Your Majesty kindly...

855
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:53,804
...place your wrist here?

856
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:55,485
Uh, yes.

857
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:57,365
Palm up, please.

858
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:58,640
Sorry.

859
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:00,689
Thank you, thank you.

860
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,006
Oh! Heh.

861
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:06,920
Very good.

862
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:09,610
Yes.

863
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,490
Yes.

864
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:15,600
It's cool.

865
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,245
Very nice. Very nice indeed.

866
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:20,366
Now, here is your...

867
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:21,681
...Code and...

868
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,729
...Conduct Guide...

869
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,482
...and your Royal Ways
and Means Commission.

870
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:29,845
And file this with...

871
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:33,801
...a Legion Administrator
for your Royal Guard appointment. Yes?

872
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:35,081
Okay.

873
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:38,091
Well, congratulations, Your Majesty...

874
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:42,090
...and my deepest condolences.

875
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:46,721
Thank you?

876
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,731
I will never complain about the DMV...

877
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:52,960
...ever again.

878
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:55,088
Well, you did it. It's official.

879
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:57,203
You are now Entitled.

880
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:59,489
Entitled to what? Like...

881
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:02,121
...free parking? Key to the city?

882
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:03,360
I mean...

883
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:05,369
...what does it even really mean?

884
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:07,563
It means Your Majesty's life
is gonna change...

885
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:09,485
...if she wants it to.

886
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:12,160
Can you say that again?

887
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:15,170
Just the "Your Majesty" part.

888
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:18,691
Your Majesty.

889
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,964
That's interesting.

890
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,130
When other people say it,
it makes me...

891
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:26,203
...really uncomfortable.

892
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:28,922
But when you say it...

893
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:30,841
I don't know.

894
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:35,406
There are things about my life
I would like to change...

895
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:38,007
...but it doesn't make
me a different person.

896
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:43,605
It doesn't change the things that
matter to me or who I care about.

897
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,050
I'm still the same me.

898
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:50,802
If Your Majesty says so.

899
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:56,051
Well, you're the one
with the Entitled instinct.

900
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:00,166
Is there something happening to you
right now?

901
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:04,204
Does any part of you wanna bite me?

902
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:07,641
No.

903
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:11,927
Well, maybe.

904
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,525
Go ahead.

905
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:22,971
How can Your Majesty be so sure...

906
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:25,402
...if, as you've said...

907
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,722
...your compass is broken?

908
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:30,649
Tell me that I'm wrong.

909
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:33,971
You used to work for Titus,
but that's not true anymore.

910
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:37,844
So why stick around?

911
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:40,407
Why help me?

912
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:46,200
Because of Stinger.

913
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:50,491
He thinks if we help you, then...

914
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:52,643
...you might help us get
back in the Legion.

915
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:55,445
- I see.
- Good to know...

916
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:57,170
...we're both liars.

917
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:58,520
What is this?

918
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:00,610
I'm sorry.

919
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:03,200
Hello, Mr. Wise.

920
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,685
Don't make this harder than it has to be.

921
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:16,885
I'm sorry, man.

922
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:01,131
Welcome, Your Majesty.

923
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:03,806
I am Titus Abrasax...

924
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:06,407
...Third Primary of the House of Abrasax...

925
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:08,530
...and it is my profound...

926
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,564
...honour...

927
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,080
...to meet you.

928
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,280
You are aware that
by detaining me without consent...

929
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:20,882
...you are in direct
violation of Statute 27b/6.

930
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:24,165
Your Highness is a quick study
of the Entitled Code, I see.

931
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:27,765
I also know that I can file
a tax grievance against you...

932
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,889
...unless you take me
where I want to go.

933
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:33,450
I'd be delighted to take you
wherever you'd like.

934
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:37,289
I'd like to go home.

935
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:40,370
Very well.

936
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:42,011
Set a course for Earth.

937
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:43,240
At once, my lord.

938
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:48,490
In the meantime,
since you've invoked Code and Conduct...

939
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:51,366
...I trust you'll do me the honour
of dining with me.

940
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:54,246
Very well.

941
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:01,963
The Aegis is involved now...

942
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:04,771
...more than likely tracking you
as we speak.

943
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,081
We've committed no crime.

944
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:07,646
How about detaining a Royal?

945
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:12,087
Her Majesty is hardly detained.

946
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:13,606
Where is she?

947
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:16,886
Dining with Lord Titus, of course.

948
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,923
Unless they've moved on to dessert.

949
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:40,131
Your Highness looks ravishing.

950
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:42,405
What have you done with Caine?

951
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:47,286
I know you do not trust me right now,
but I promise I am not your enemy.

952
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:51,726
Please.

953
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:00,486
Mr. Wise and I had an arrangement.

954
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:04,167
He broke our contract. For that, I promised
to return him to the Deadland.

955
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:07,728
Is that open to negotiation?

956
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:11,323
Everything is open to negotiation.

957
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:32,090
I confess I feel I have you
at somewhat of a disadvantage.

958
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:33,521
Because you kidnapped me?

959
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,368
From the moment I saw your geneprint,
I knew so many things about you...

960
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:40,489
...because I was very close to my mother.

961
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:41,720
So close, in fact...

962
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:44,241
...that I could tell by the way
she raised her eyebrows...

963
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:47,405
...exactly what she was thinking.

964
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:51,685
At this point, I probably know more
about you than you know yourself.

965
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:53,441
Shoot.

966
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:56,205
Just like her.

967
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:58,408
Always expecting the worst from people.

968
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:00,842
Funny how often people
exceed those expectations.

969
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:05,205
That distrust in others,
in the world and even in yourself...

970
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:07,801
...has made it difficult
for you to fall in love.

971
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:09,561
Until now.

972
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:13,568
You're in love with Mr. Wise, aren't you?

973
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:16,531
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but this isn't love.

974
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:20,331
All Mr. Wise wants from me
is to make him a Legionnaire.

975
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:24,529
Mother was also a terrible liar.

976
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:27,491
Your sister told me you would do
anything in your power...

977
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:29,320
...to prevent me from claiming my Title.

978
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:31,200
What makes you think Kalique
told the truth?

979
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:32,680
- Why would she lie?
- Kalique is...

980
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:36,167
...in competition with Balem.
The loss of Earth will impact his position...

981
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:38,164
...in the market. His loss is her gain.

982
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:39,447
Same can be said for you.

983
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:46,167
Not long ago, yes.

984
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:49,200
- I would have been just like them.
- And now?

985
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:53,968
I knew this moment would come
when your geneprint was first confirmed.

986
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:55,440
When it did, I was going to...

987
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:57,290
...ask you one question...

988
01:13:57,560 --> 01:14:00,928
...and if you gave me the right answer,
I was going to change my life...

989
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:02,281
...irrevocably.

990
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,365
Come with me.

991
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:17,324
What is that?

992
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:19,130
It has many names:

993
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:21,886
ReGenX, ReCell, Nectar.

994
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:25,528
There are various levels
of usefulness and quality, but this...

995
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:29,651
...is the most pure and most valuable
solution made by the House of Abrasax.

996
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:31,845
Kalique came out of a bath...

997
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:34,807
Naturally, my sister didn't
explain what it is...

998
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:37,042
...or where it comes from.

999
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:39,690
It comes from people.

1000
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:44,760
Each unit is refined from approximately
a hundred human beings.

1001
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:46,121
What?

1002
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:47,765
Your planet is a farm...

1003
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:50,771
...Jupiter. There are thousands
of planets like yours...

1004
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,611
...set up by families like mine
to supply...

1005
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:56,965
...an ever increasing demand
for more time.

1006
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:02,005
Are you saying you killed
a hundred people to make this?

1007
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:03,890
Not me, but...

1008
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:06,203
...yes, someone did.

1009
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:08,968
Not unlike...

1010
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:10,531
...butchering a herd of cattle.

1011
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:15,450
- Oh, my God.
- It's all right.

1012
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:17,810
It's all right.

1013
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:21,291
My mother went through a change
at the end of her life.

1014
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:24,610
She felt exactly as you do now.
But when she tried...

1015
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:27,684
...to do something to stop this business,
she was murdered.

1016
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:29,644
I believe the same thing
is about to happen to me...

1017
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:32,241
...because I began to carry out
the work she started.

1018
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:35,811
That is why I hired Mr. Wise to find you.

1019
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:38,846
I needed someone I could trust.

1020
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:40,847
I cannot allow...

1021
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:42,764
...my brother or sister
to end up with control...

1022
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,367
...over my part of the Abrasax inheritance.

1023
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:47,688
I want to know that when I die...

1024
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:50,242
...you will be my heir.

1025
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:54,765
Which brings us at last to my question.

1026
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:59,041
Jupiter Jones...

1027
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:04,210
...will you marry me?

1028
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:18,445
Pleasure doing business with you.

1029
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:22,167
<i>I told your men not to take Caine.
You should have left him on Orous.</i>

1030
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:24,522
<i>Unfortunately, my lord promised Mr. Wise...</i>

1031
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,848
<i>...that if he betrayed us,
he'd be fed to the Void.</i>

1032
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:28,762
Titus Abrasax...

1033
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,604
...is a man of his word.

1034
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:34,851
So was I.

1035
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:36,610
We got the trace.

1036
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:38,845
Outside the Cleopeides.

1037
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:43,005
Better get a move on.
Don't sound like Caine's got a lot of time.

1038
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:45,530
Put him back in the brig.

1039
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:58,528
Lord Titus will see you now.

1040
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:04,209
You should have told me
the truth about why...

1041
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:05,805
...you wanted her.

1042
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:08,611
What good would that have done?
If I did...

1043
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:10,001
...Jupiter would be dead...

1044
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:12,527
...and Balem would still own the Earth.

1045
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:14,728
Lies are a necessity.

1046
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:18,282
They are the source of meaning...

1047
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:20,841
...of belief and hope.

1048
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,005
Honestly, lies are sometimes...

1049
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:26,647
...the only reason I get out of bed.

1050
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:40,885
I'm particularly fond
of the lies we tell ourselves.

1051
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:42,963
Like the lie you are now concocting...

1052
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:46,409
...that somehow you'll survive
being tossed into the Void...

1053
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:48,968
...and find some way to rescue Miss Jones.

1054
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:52,124
You can't kill her.
The Title will just remain with her family.

1055
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:55,809
Well, not once Her Majesty and I
are married.

1056
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:49,200
<i>Emergency pressurisation complete.</i>

1057
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:59,564
<i>You have 37 minutes of air remaining.</i>

1058
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:05,407
<i>Please get to an airlock or life pod
immediately.</i>

1059
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:09,765
You did what?

1060
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,331
- Shame on you.
- Wait.

1061
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:13,051
You're telling me you...

1062
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:16,443
...convinced your cousin to sell her eggs?

1063
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:17,249
Yeah?

1064
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:18,600
What do you think she is...

1065
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:20,240
...a goddamn chicken?

1066
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:21,891
- Dad! She wanted to!
- Enough!

1067
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:24,050
She wanted to do it.

1068
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:25,526
It wasn't all my plan.

1069
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:27,680
- You little shit, Vladie!
- She begged me.

1070
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:29,729
She wanted to buy some stupid telescope.

1071
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:31,644
- Deal wasn't good for me.
- Telescope?

1072
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:34,167
It's a curse.
Our family is cursed.

1073
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:35,208
I don't care what she wanted!

1074
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:36,440
You don't...

1075
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:37,169
...treat your cousin...

1076
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:38,401
...like chicken!

1077
01:19:58,720 --> 01:19:59,720
Dad!

1078
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:17,606
You're the mother.

1079
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:23,491
Be gentle with this one.

1080
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,321
<i>You have zero minutes of air remaining.</i>

1081
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:31,404
<i>Carbon dioxide levels at maximum.</i>

1082
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:34,843
<i>Please get to an airlock or life pod
immediately.</i>

1083
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:36,923
<i>You have zero minutes of air remaining.</i>

1084
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:47,200
Is he alive?

1085
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:50,329
- Few ticks later and he wouldn't be.
- He's gonna kill her.

1086
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:51,561
He's gonna kill her.

1087
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:58,360
Is there a problem?

1088
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:02,605
- No, I'm so sorry, I don't think I can do this.
- I told you not to think about it...

1089
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:04,569
...like a wedding on your world.

1090
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:05,881
It's just a contract...

1091
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:08,964
...in order to protect people.
Innocent people.

1092
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:11,043
- I get that...
- Wish I could show you the four planets...

1093
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:13,886
...I inherited.
Nothing as large as your Earth...

1094
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:16,805
...but each unique and beautiful
in its own way.

1095
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:19,042
I'd love to see them one day, but...

1096
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:22,244
Right now, I need to speak to Caine.

1097
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:24,645
I see.

1098
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:28,680
You still don't trust me,
even though you trust the man I hired.

1099
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,126
I'm sorry...

1100
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:33,320
...but talking to Mr. Wise
is no longer possible.

1101
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:35,242
Why?

1102
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:38,006
He attacked a Servitant
and destroyed a host of guards.

1103
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:41,170
Given his history, I was advised
to return him to the authorities.

1104
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:44,326
You do know what he did, don't you?

1105
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:47,683
And you still trust him.

1106
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:50,442
Beauty and her Beast.

1107
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:52,365
Why wouldn't you tell me sooner?

1108
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:55,163
So you can plead...

1109
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:56,400
...for this.

1110
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:59,285
The original Rite of Pardon and
Reinstatement my law has procured...

1111
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:00,766
...for him and Mr. Apini.

1112
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:03,930
I kept it, knowing how you felt,
even if you wouldn't admit it.

1113
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:11,411
To be fair, there was a time when I would
have used something like this against you.

1114
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:14,402
But now, if you can believe anything,
Jupiter...

1115
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:16,881
...the life of one Splice
matters very little to me...

1116
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:18,969
...compared to the lives of my subjects.

1117
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:28,763
Goodbye, Miss Jones.

1118
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:33,050
Titus.

1119
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:38,486
I'll do it.

1120
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,570
Thank you.

1121
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:51,486
- Oh-oh.
- I need your help.

1122
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:54,405
Sure you want to go into a fight
with someone you can't trust?

1123
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:57,610
Has anyone in your crew ever
broke through a field of Warhammers?

1124
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:00,720
What happened?

1125
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:05,963
Kiza's got the Bug.
Couldn't afford the ReCode.

1126
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:07,769
I love...

1127
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:09,485
...my daughter, Caine.

1128
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:12,166
She's the only good thing
I've done with this life.

1129
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:16,409
You would have done the same.

1130
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:20,610
- Any other family issues I should know about?
- No.

1131
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:21,840
Loans?

1132
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:23,480
Money problems?

1133
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:25,730
Uh, no.

1134
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,843
He's good. Let's go.

1135
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:55,641
Holy crap.

1136
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:01,640
Portal at mass.

1137
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,290
<i>Nine ticks to intercept.</i>

1138
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:32,490
Abrasax Clipper D-Gamma-9,
this is the Aegis.

1139
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:33,881
Cut your engines...

1140
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:35,724
...and prepare to be boarded.

1141
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:47,122
The Aegis are demanding to board, sire.

1142
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:51,969
Do what you must,
but keep them off this ship.

1143
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:56,681
<i>Is at full stage.</i>

1144
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:58,763
Warhammers are launching.

1145
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:11,526
Here we go.

1146
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,411
Your Highness.

1147
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:19,846
Who are all these people?

1148
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:21,645
Just Sims.

1149
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:23,729
A necessary feature for all royal weddings.

1150
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,766
As I told you, these are matters of State,
not of the heart.

1151
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:29,280
Shall we begin?

1152
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:40,721
Let's hit it!

1153
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:48,487
I, Titus Abrasax...

1154
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:52,645
...take Jupiter Jones to be my wife.
I enter into this union...

1155
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:55,486
...being of sound mind
and of my own volition.

1156
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:56,323
Would my liege...

1157
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:58,403
...place his hand here...

1158
01:25:58,640 --> 01:26:00,927
...to receive the Signifying Bond?

1159
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:12,884
Break left, I'm going right!

1160
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:29,011
Aah! I'm hit!

1161
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:36,170
Your turn.

1162
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:37,646
Where are you at, Stinger?

1163
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:42,240
- I've lost a wing plate!
<i>- I got you!</i>

1164
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:48,207
Roll, roll, roll!

1165
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:52,480
Aah!

1166
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:57,649
I, Jupiter Jones...

1167
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:01,610
...take Titus Abrasax to be my husband.

1168
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:14,840
I enter into this union being...

1169
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:20,210
I enter into this union...

1170
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:23,686
...being of sound mind...

1171
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:25,724
...and of my own volition.

1172
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:36,560
We're clear!

1173
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:43,331
Would Your Majesty place her hand here...

1174
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:45,722
...to receive the Signifying Bond?

1175
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:51,969
I'm tracking heavy Sim activity.
That's gotta be where she is.

1176
01:27:58,920 --> 01:27:59,920
Cover me!

1177
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:09,040
What's going on?

1178
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:10,680
What was that?

1179
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:13,760
No!

1180
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:29,160
Caine?

1181
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:31,040
Whoa!

1182
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,846
Mr. Wise, you are as resourceful
as promised.

1183
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:39,683
This whole thing was nothing but a lie.

1184
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:42,567
Was the ring executed?

1185
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:44,681
No.

1186
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:46,160
Once you were married...

1187
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:48,328
...he was going to murder you.

1188
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:51,405
He told me right before
he threw me out the airlock.

1189
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:54,961
Honestly...

1190
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:57,010
...I don't believe my mother was ever...

1191
01:28:57,240 --> 01:28:58,685
...as beautiful...

1192
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:01,608
...or as gullible as you, my dear.

1193
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:04,201
May I kill him?

1194
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:08,208
Just get me out of here.

1195
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:23,169
- Your Majesty?
- Don't call me that.

1196
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:26,371
Titus will pay. Captain Tsing...

1197
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:28,250
- ...has already filed...
- I don't care.

1198
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,000
The more you care...

1199
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:34,321
...the more the world
finds ways to hurt you for it.

1200
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:44,921
That's your pardon.

1201
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:46,286
Congratulations...

1202
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,844
...you and Stinger
are officially Skyjackers again.

1203
01:29:53,240 --> 01:29:54,651
Thank you.

1204
01:29:56,400 --> 01:30:00,166
- When we were in the Commonwealth...
- I don't wanna talk.

1205
01:30:05,680 --> 01:30:08,570
I really just wanna go home.

1206
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:19,011
Mom?

1207
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:20,925
Oh, God, no. Nino!

1208
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:22,321
Good evening...

1209
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:23,931
...Your Majesty.

1210
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:25,361
Easy, dingo.

1211
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:29,686
Where's my family?

1212
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:31,649
Well, we can all only hope...

1213
01:30:31,880 --> 01:30:34,645
...that they remain unharmed. Heh.

1214
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:41,082
I see you have the standard-issue
Abrasax temper.

1215
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:43,160
A transfer of Title
has already been processed.

1216
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:46,249
You and your lord
are trespassing in this precinct.

1217
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:48,687
We are aware of all current legalities.

1218
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:50,921
I have been instructed...

1219
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:52,844
...to offer Your Grace a proposal.

1220
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:54,401
What proposal?

1221
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:57,564
You are to come with me
to meet my lord. There you will...

1222
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:01,129
...abdicate your Title...

1223
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:03,442
...and in return, my lord guarantees...

1224
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:05,802
...that he will do
everything in his power...

1225
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:10,045
...to see that no harm
comes to you or your family.

1226
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:11,560
You can't do it.

1227
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:13,085
You cannot trust these people.

1228
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:15,600
If you abdicate, you'll have nothing
to protect yourself.

1229
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:20,601
You'll kill them if I don't come with you.

1230
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:21,966
Your Majesty...

1231
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:24,720
...I could not even consider
such an abhorrent crime.

1232
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,206
He's lying.

1233
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:27,680
You wound me, Mr. Wise.

1234
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:29,480
If I were trying to wound you...

1235
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:31,489
...you wouldn't be breathing.

1236
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:34,485
If it makes everyone feel warm and cozy...

1237
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:36,922
...the Aegis is welcome to follow us.

1238
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:38,400
No.

1239
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:40,245
She won't go anywhere with you.

1240
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:42,285
Very well.

1241
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:45,928
I will inform my lord
you have rejected his offer.

1242
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:48,680
Wait.

1243
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:56,531
This is my family.

1244
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:58,405
It's too dangerous.

1245
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:00,365
I know...

1246
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:03,402
...but it's not your decision.

1247
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:18,010
This is Greeghan, on approach.

1248
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:21,084
We have an escort.

1249
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:25,649
Mr. Nesh, keep us close.

1250
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:28,042
Mr. Wise, that pacing is not helping.

1251
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:31,045
<i>The gate is prepped and standing by, sir.</i>

1252
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:36,320
Captain Tsing.

1253
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:37,920
They're closing the vortex. Shields up.

1254
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:40,840
Accelerate to full.

1255
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:48,720
We've lost all nav-com!

1256
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,047
Grav-drive not responding.

1257
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:53,320
Shields failing!

1258
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:57,280
Get us out of here!

1259
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:04,720
<i>Frozen ionisation ratio critical.</i>

1260
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:17,726
Damn it.

1261
01:33:57,800 --> 01:33:59,529
Where's my family?

1262
01:34:00,440 --> 01:34:02,886
You should have stayed dead.

1263
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:05,407
I am not your mother.

1264
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:07,000
No, my mother...

1265
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:10,329
...never cleaned a toilet in her life.

1266
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:11,641
Maybe that was her problem.

1267
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:15,044
My mother.

1268
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:21,450
My mother...

1269
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:24,047
...taught me what was necessary...

1270
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:26,487
...to rule in this universe.

1271
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:28,410
Like killing people?

1272
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:31,570
I create life!

1273
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:36,688
And I destroy it.

1274
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:42,330
Life is an act of consumption...

1275
01:34:43,120 --> 01:34:44,531
...Jupiter.

1276
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:46,729
To live...

1277
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:49,163
...is to consume.

1278
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:52,523
Now, the human beings on your planet...

1279
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:55,924
...are merely a resource waiting to...

1280
01:34:56,160 --> 01:34:58,322
...be converted into capital.

1281
01:35:00,440 --> 01:35:02,442
And this entire enterprise...

1282
01:35:02,680 --> 01:35:06,241
...is just a small part in a vast...

1283
01:35:06,520 --> 01:35:09,091
...and beautiful machine defined...

1284
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:10,526
...by evolution...

1285
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:14,043
...designed to a single purpose:

1286
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:19,642
To create profit.

1287
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:24,922
If that's what your mother taught you,
then I can see why you hated her.

1288
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:28,964
I loved my mother.

1289
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:32,331
And yet, you're trying to kill me.

1290
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:34,889
My mother...

1291
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:37,725
...made me understand...

1292
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,241
...that every human society...

1293
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:42,801
...is a pyramid and that some lives...

1294
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:45,805
...will always matter more than others.

1295
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:50,446
It is better to accept this...

1296
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:53,044
...than to pretend it isn't true.

1297
01:35:58,320 --> 01:35:59,731
Is that why you killed her?

1298
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:03,648
How dare you?

1299
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,120
I know because of...

1300
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:26,523
...who and what you are,
you're unable to say this...

1301
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:29,249
...so I'll say it for you.

1302
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:35,040
You lied in the Commonwealth
because you're a Hunter...

1303
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:38,802
...who's been searching
for one thing his whole life.

1304
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,968
You survived so long without it...

1305
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:45,647
...the fact that you may have found it
terrifies you...

1306
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:49,362
...but not as much as the fact
that she's down there...

1307
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:52,320
...buried in several tons of hurricane.

1308
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:54,688
And if you want to see her again...

1309
01:36:54,920 --> 01:36:56,570
...then you take my advice:

1310
01:36:56,800 --> 01:37:00,043
You get down there and you start digging.

1311
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:08,282
This is a Notice of Abdication.

1312
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:11,251
You will confess your genetic incapacity
to rule...

1313
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:12,726
...and you will return...

1314
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:14,883
...the Title to its natural heir.

1315
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:17,010
Where's my family?

1316
01:37:27,640 --> 01:37:28,640
Mom.

1317
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:29,760
Oh, God.

1318
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,411
I will do...

1319
01:37:33,640 --> 01:37:36,962
...whatever it is that you want
so long as the Aegis...

1320
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:38,765
...can get my family out safely.

1321
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:42,010
You are in no position to negotiate.

1322
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:50,683
Stop.

1323
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:51,960
Stop, stop!

1324
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,206
I will do anything.

1325
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:54,646
Please, you win. I beg...

1326
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:55,880
...of you, stop.

1327
01:37:55,960 --> 01:37:57,086
Please.

1328
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,082
<i>Mr. Wise, as a matter of public record...</i>

1329
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:24,325
...I strongly advise against this reckless
course of action that will almost certainly...

1330
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:26,369
<i>...cost you your life.</i>

1331
01:38:26,600 --> 01:38:27,600
Understood.

1332
01:38:30,040 --> 01:38:33,840
Off the record, I will tell you
that you're a man of rare courage...

1333
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:35,969
...and I pray your aim is true.

1334
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:38,885
Thank you.

1335
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:19,682
Aah!

1336
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:42,251
And hereby return the Title...

1337
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:45,802
...to its original heir, Balem Abrasax.

1338
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:54,368
Once I seal this...

1339
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:57,203
...how long until you harvest the Earth?

1340
01:39:57,920 --> 01:40:00,890
I can promise that you will not see it.

1341
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:02,850
But how long?

1342
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:07,248
You knew nothing of harvesting before.
Why should it matter now?

1343
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:10,486
Remember...

1344
01:40:11,080 --> 01:40:13,447
...why you're here.

1345
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:20,765
I came here to try to protect my family.

1346
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:23,602
Seal that sheave...

1347
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:25,490
...and you and your family...

1348
01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:28,246
...will return home safely.

1349
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:37,167
If I don't seal this...

1350
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:41,726
...you can't touch the Earth,
even if you kill me.

1351
01:40:42,440 --> 01:40:44,090
Is that right?

1352
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:47,125
That planet belongs to me.

1353
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:50,084
It is my right.

1354
01:40:57,880 --> 01:40:59,450
Not anymore.

1355
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:03,689
You have no idea what you are doing.

1356
01:41:04,280 --> 01:41:08,126
I am making sure that whatever you do
to me and my family...

1357
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:10,328
...you're not able to do to anyone else's.

1358
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:13,761
This is not a game.

1359
01:41:15,240 --> 01:41:18,926
I am not my brother or my sister.

1360
01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:20,321
If you do not seal...

1361
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:22,050
Beg pardon, my lord.

1362
01:41:22,280 --> 01:41:23,800
- Mr. Night.
- It is an emergency.

1363
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:25,000
The grav-hull is ruptured.

1364
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:28,891
The gas is reacting to the stockworks.

1365
01:41:36,920 --> 01:41:38,285
You seal it now.

1366
01:41:51,080 --> 01:41:52,080
Seal it now!

1367
01:42:05,640 --> 01:42:06,880
- Unh!
- My lord...

1368
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:08,120
...is that advisable...

1369
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:09,200
...without the Abdication?

1370
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:12,880
Kill her!

1371
01:42:22,640 --> 01:42:24,051
Here, take this.

1372
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:25,760
- Get your family out.
- Wait.

1373
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:33,648
In case we don't get the chance again.

1374
01:42:36,120 --> 01:42:37,120
Go.

1375
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:40,560
I'm getting readings...

1376
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:42,848
...from the refinery. It's destabilised.

1377
01:42:43,080 --> 01:42:44,366
Sinking fast.

1378
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:27,970
Captain, the gate's open.

1379
01:43:28,200 --> 01:43:29,201
It's an evacuation.

1380
01:43:33,560 --> 01:43:34,607
Get us down there, Nesh.

1381
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:50,928
- Aah!
- You're just like her.

1382
01:43:51,240 --> 01:43:52,605
You won't pull that trigger.

1383
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:54,920
Aah!

1384
01:44:09,720 --> 01:44:10,720
Jupiter!

1385
01:46:56,040 --> 01:46:58,441
You hurt me.

1386
01:47:02,040 --> 01:47:03,883
And I'm gonna make you...

1387
01:47:04,120 --> 01:47:05,120
...regret it.

1388
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:49,691
- Captain, I'm tracking a ping.
- Is it Her Majesty?

1389
01:47:50,280 --> 01:47:50,883
Signature unknown.

1390
01:47:51,120 --> 01:47:52,645
Attempting to lock in.

1391
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:55,720
This is Captain Tsing of the Aegis.
We are tracking. Can you click back?

1392
01:47:57,120 --> 01:47:58,120
<i>This is Caine.</i>

1393
01:47:58,400 --> 01:47:59,400
Yes.

1394
01:47:59,560 --> 01:48:00,607
<i>I have the family.</i>

1395
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:02,569
<i>Can you extract?</i>

1396
01:48:49,320 --> 01:48:51,721
- Get them strapped into stasis.
- This one's dehydrated.

1397
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,844
- Get me a full tox on this one.
- Caine, we can't wait long.

1398
01:48:55,080 --> 01:48:57,082
Give me every second you can.

1399
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:26,404
Is this familiar, Mother?

1400
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:31,485
Does some part of you remember this
like I do?

1401
01:49:32,040 --> 01:49:33,041
Well, this is how...

1402
01:49:33,280 --> 01:49:34,280
...it began.

1403
01:49:39,280 --> 01:49:40,645
We were fighting.

1404
01:49:42,440 --> 01:49:44,169
Do you remember what you said?

1405
01:49:50,120 --> 01:49:51,360
Get back!

1406
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:10,525
I remember what you said.

1407
01:50:15,640 --> 01:50:18,610
You told me you hated your life.

1408
01:50:19,440 --> 01:50:21,283
It's the truth.

1409
01:50:22,760 --> 01:50:25,411
And you begged me to do it.

1410
01:50:28,040 --> 01:50:30,930
You begged me to do it!

1411
01:50:31,560 --> 01:50:34,211
I am not your damn mother.

1412
01:51:23,320 --> 01:51:24,446
Jupiter.

1413
01:51:24,680 --> 01:51:26,409
Just breathe. You're all right.

1414
01:51:26,640 --> 01:51:27,971
Just breathe.

1415
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:31,126
My family?

1416
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:32,526
They're safe.

1417
01:51:39,120 --> 01:51:39,769
Medic!

1418
01:51:40,040 --> 01:51:41,080
We can't hold much longer.

1419
01:51:41,160 --> 01:51:42,241
Set a portal.

1420
01:51:43,240 --> 01:51:43,843
Now.

1421
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:45,720
I don't need to tell you how dangerous...

1422
01:51:45,960 --> 01:51:48,645
Then don't!
I promised every second I could.

1423
01:51:55,840 --> 01:51:57,001
Oh, no.

1424
01:52:13,720 --> 01:52:15,085
Twelve ticks to portal.

1425
01:52:15,320 --> 01:52:16,320
Eruption imminent!

1426
01:52:29,800 --> 01:52:30,800
Portal's open!

1427
01:52:31,720 --> 01:52:32,926
Come on, Caine.

1428
01:52:39,160 --> 01:52:40,321
Core-gen's about to blow!

1429
01:52:53,600 --> 01:52:54,600
Now!

1430
01:53:05,360 --> 01:53:06,360
Everyone all right?

1431
01:53:06,520 --> 01:53:07,520
Aye, captain.

1432
01:53:10,720 --> 01:53:11,846
Captain...

1433
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:14,890
...I don't understand,
but I'm pinging Mr. Wise again.

1434
01:53:15,480 --> 01:53:16,641
What?

1435
01:53:18,480 --> 01:53:19,800
<i>Hello in there.</i>

1436
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:22,002
Wise, where are you?

1437
01:53:22,240 --> 01:53:24,720
<i>Why don't you take
a look out your window?</i>

1438
01:53:26,040 --> 01:53:28,805
<i>You might want to open the door for us
or something.</i>

1439
01:53:56,320 --> 01:53:58,004
Jupiter.

1440
01:53:58,520 --> 01:54:01,967
Jupiter, get up. Make the coffee.

1441
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:09,800
Morning, Nino.

1442
01:54:15,560 --> 01:54:17,130
Morning, Mama.

1443
01:54:40,280 --> 01:54:41,520
Jupiter.

1444
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:42,966
Yeah?

1445
01:54:44,040 --> 01:54:46,247
- Need help?
- All done.

1446
01:54:50,040 --> 01:54:51,405
English, please.

1447
01:54:52,240 --> 01:54:53,240
Vladie.

1448
01:54:54,520 --> 01:54:55,681
Look, Jupiter...

1449
01:54:57,240 --> 01:54:59,447
...I know we don't always see eye to eye.

1450
01:55:01,080 --> 01:55:02,241
But, um...

1451
01:55:03,440 --> 01:55:06,284
- ...well...
- For you, my dear.

1452
01:55:08,720 --> 01:55:12,167
- Why? It's not even my birthday.
- Vladie told us what you wanted...

1453
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:14,004
- ...the money for.
- You didn't.

1454
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:16,290
No.

1455
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,000
Are you serious?

1456
01:55:22,120 --> 01:55:23,610
Oh, my God.

1457
01:55:25,040 --> 01:55:26,326
Oh, my God.

1458
01:55:26,600 --> 01:55:27,600
We all pitched in.

1459
01:55:28,080 --> 01:55:29,080
Thank you.

1460
01:55:29,280 --> 01:55:31,601
Your father was good man...

1461
01:55:31,840 --> 01:55:33,285
...and I loved him very much.

1462
01:55:35,120 --> 01:55:37,088
And you should have this.

1463
01:55:38,360 --> 01:55:39,600
Could we take it to the roof?

1464
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:41,891
Um...

1465
01:55:42,360 --> 01:55:44,089
I'm so sorry. I...

1466
01:55:44,640 --> 01:55:46,085
I actually have a date.

1467
01:55:46,320 --> 01:55:46,889
What?

1468
01:55:47,160 --> 01:55:48,525
- What?
- Is he Russian?

1469
01:55:48,760 --> 01:55:50,410
- Is he rich?
- Does he have a brother?

1470
01:55:50,640 --> 01:55:51,840
Does he need a big television?

1471
01:55:51,960 --> 01:55:52,960
How is he with a mop?

1472
01:55:53,080 --> 01:55:54,411
What's his name?

1473
01:55:54,640 --> 01:55:56,290
- What's his sign?
- I don't know.

1474
01:56:02,920 --> 01:56:05,002
I guess you can say
my family's complicated...

1475
01:56:05,240 --> 01:56:06,924
...the way that most families are.

1476
01:56:07,160 --> 01:56:08,810
- You think you'll ever tell them?
- What?

1477
01:56:09,040 --> 01:56:11,441
- That I own the Earth?
- Mm-hm.

1478
01:56:11,680 --> 01:56:14,650
Heh. Are you kidding me?
They'd have me locked up.

1479
01:56:15,040 --> 01:56:16,769
And I wouldn't blame them either.

1480
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:18,001
Besides...

1481
01:56:18,280 --> 01:56:21,170
...I'm still trying to understand
exactly what it means myself.

1482
01:56:21,400 --> 01:56:24,244
Maybe it means Your Majesty's
planet has a different future...

1483
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:26,448
...than the one that was planned for it.

1484
01:56:28,600 --> 01:56:29,931
Say that again.

1485
01:56:31,160 --> 01:56:34,482
- You mean "Your Majesty"?
- Mm.

1486
01:56:36,080 --> 01:56:38,048
That really works for me.

1487
01:56:38,280 --> 01:56:39,486
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1488
01:56:40,680 --> 01:56:41,680
All right.

1489
01:56:43,080 --> 01:56:44,366
Come on.

1490
01:56:53,240 --> 01:56:55,322
That ain't bad either.

1491
01:57:08,640 --> 01:57:10,369
Well, I can get used to this.

1492
01:57:26,640 --> 01:57:28,005
You ready?

1493
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:30,689
Watch this.
