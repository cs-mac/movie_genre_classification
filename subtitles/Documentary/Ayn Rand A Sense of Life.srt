1
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:10,678
It's getting cold.

2
00:04:14,974 --> 00:04:18,230
That is one fine frame.

3
00:04:18,313 --> 00:04:20,440
One fine frame that is.

4
00:04:20,524 --> 00:04:23,610
How much...

5
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:30,244
does a fine frame like that
cost, do you think?

6
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:36,168
I never told you, but you sound a little
like Dr. Seuss when you're drunk.

7
00:04:36,252 --> 00:04:39,588
I know.
I'm serious.

8
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,590
Serious, I am.

9
00:04:43,968 --> 00:04:46,430
I'd say it cost at least
a couple hundred.

10
00:04:46,472 --> 00:04:50,977
- I'm gonna read it for you.
- Do I really sound like Dr. Seuss?

11
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,188
"In recognition of his
outstanding achievement...

12
00:04:54,272 --> 00:04:56,859
- " in the field of child psychology,
- Mm-hmm.

13
00:04:56,943 --> 00:05:01,906
his dedication to his work and his continuing
efforts to improve the quality of life-- "

14
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,453
Will you concentrate?

15
00:05:05,537 --> 00:05:08,790
"...his continuing efforts to
improve the quality of life...

16
00:05:08,873 --> 00:05:11,751
"for countless children and their families,

17
00:05:11,835 --> 00:05:15,882
"the city of Philadelphia
proudly bestows upon its son...

18
00:05:15,924 --> 00:05:18,677
Dr. Malcolm Crowe--"
That's you--

19
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,680
"...the Mayor's Citation
for professional excellence."

20
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:26,478
They called you their son.

21
00:05:26,562 --> 00:05:29,273
Wow.

22
00:05:29,356 --> 00:05:31,859
We should hang it
in the bathroom.

23
00:05:34,945 --> 00:05:37,575
This is an important
night for us.

24
00:05:39,035 --> 00:05:43,289
Finally, someone is recognizing
the sacrifices you've made--

25
00:05:43,372 --> 00:05:47,920
that you have put everything
second, including me,

26
00:05:48,004 --> 00:05:51,133
for those families that
they're talking about.

27
00:05:55,012 --> 00:05:57,975
They're also saying that
my husband has a gift.

28
00:05:59,518 --> 00:06:01,479
You have a gift
that teaches children...

29
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,148
how to be strong in situations...

30
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:07,028
where most adults
would piss on themselves.

31
00:06:08,112 --> 00:06:10,823
I believe what they wrote is real.

32
00:06:15,121 --> 00:06:17,040
Thank you.

33
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:23,338
- I would like some wine in a glass.
- Mm- hmm.

34
00:06:23,421 --> 00:06:25,384
I would not like it
in a mug.

35
00:06:25,467 --> 00:06:30,097
I would not like it in a jug.

36
00:06:52,123 --> 00:06:54,041
Look.

37
00:07:37,137 --> 00:07:39,765
Anna, don't move.
Don't make a sound.

38
00:07:44,436 --> 00:07:47,399
This is 47 Locus Street.

39
00:07:49,109 --> 00:07:51,153
You've broken a window
and entered a private residence.

40
00:07:51,236 --> 00:07:54,948
You don't know so many things.

41
00:07:55,032 --> 00:08:00,790
There are no needles or prescription
drugs of any kind in this house.

42
00:08:09,258 --> 00:08:11,803
Do you know why you're afraid
when you're alone?

43
00:08:15,266 --> 00:08:17,852
I do.
I do.

44
00:08:17,936 --> 00:08:20,188
What do you want?

45
00:08:20,271 --> 00:08:24,067
What he promised me!
I want what he promised me.

46
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,530
- Oh, my God.
- Do I know you?

47
00:08:26,613 --> 00:08:30,242
Don't you know me, hero?

48
00:08:30,325 --> 00:08:32,410
Don't you even remember
your own patients?

49
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:39,670
Downtown clinic.

50
00:08:39,711 --> 00:08:42,172
Single- parent family.

51
00:08:43,507 --> 00:08:45,469
Possible mood disorder.

52
00:08:47,763 --> 00:08:50,015
I was afraid!

53
00:08:50,099 --> 00:08:54,687
You told me I was having trouble
coping with my parents' divorce.

54
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:57,608
You were wrong.
You were wrong.

55
00:09:00,194 --> 00:09:02,780
Now look at me!

56
00:09:02,822 --> 00:09:07,287
- I don't want to be afraid no more.
- Just give me a minute to think.

57
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,539
I waited
ten years for you!

58
00:09:09,622 --> 00:09:11,542
I'm not giving you nothing!

59
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:14,378
Ben Friedkin?

60
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:18,801
Some people,
they call me "freak."

61
00:09:18,843 --> 00:09:21,012
Ryan Summer?

62
00:09:21,095 --> 00:09:24,181
I am. I am a freak.
Look at--

63
00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:28,396
Vincent.

64
00:09:28,438 --> 00:09:30,398
Vincent Gray.

65
00:09:32,734 --> 00:09:35,363
No, you don't.

66
00:09:35,447 --> 00:09:37,866
I do remember you.

67
00:09:37,949 --> 00:09:41,536
Quiet, very smart.

68
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,538
Compassionate.

69
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:47,753
Unusually compassionate.

70
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,007
You forgot cursed.

71
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:57,932
You failed me.

72
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,892
You failed me!

73
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:07,360
Vincent, I'm sorry if I wasn't--
if I didn't help you.

74
00:10:07,401 --> 00:10:10,237
But if you just let me try,

75
00:10:10,321 --> 00:10:12,531
if you just
give me a chance--

76
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,294
Oh, God! Oh, God!

77
00:10:23,378 --> 00:10:26,299
- Did Vincent--
- Don't talk. Shh.

78
00:12:56,966 --> 00:12:58,926
It's okay, Cole.

79
00:12:58,968 --> 00:13:01,763
My name is Dr. Malcolm Crowe.

80
00:13:02,931 --> 00:13:07,312
We were supposed to meet today,
but I missed our appointment.

81
00:13:07,395 --> 00:13:09,314
I'm sorry.

82
00:13:17,908 --> 00:13:23,080
You know, in the olden days in Europe,
people used to hide out in churches.

83
00:13:23,163 --> 00:13:25,501
They would claim sanctuary.

84
00:13:30,589 --> 00:13:32,508
What were they hiding from?

85
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,432
Bad people, mostly.

86
00:13:38,516 --> 00:13:42,978
People that wanted to
put them in jail, hurt them.

87
00:13:45,483 --> 00:13:49,278
I noticed your eyeglasses.
They don't have any lenses in them.

88
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:51,572
They're my dad's.

89
00:13:51,656 --> 00:13:54,077
The lenses hurt my eyes.

90
00:13:55,745 --> 00:14:00,083
What were you talking about with your
soldiers when I came in? Day--

91
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:03,044
Deprofundus clamo
adite domine.

92
00:14:04,131 --> 00:14:06,049
It's called " Latin."

93
00:14:10,596 --> 00:14:14,059
- All your soldiers speak Latin?
- No.

94
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:16,062
Just one.

95
00:14:18,106 --> 00:14:20,525
Are you a good doctor?

96
00:14:21,109 --> 00:14:23,571
Well,

97
00:14:23,656 --> 00:14:25,574
I used to be.

98
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,912
I won an award once
from the mayor.

99
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:33,374
It had an expensive frame.

100
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,560
I'm gonna see you again, right?

101
00:14:49,602 --> 00:14:52,313
If that's okay with you.

102
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:28,107
It's me.

103
00:17:14,945 --> 00:17:17,990
The turnpike westbound slows
at Valley Forge 24.

104
00:17:18,073 --> 00:17:21,410
On the Blue Ridge, both directions generally
slow between number three and two--

105
00:17:25,457 --> 00:17:27,418
Hey, good morning.

106
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,847
Cole.

107
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:43,186
Cole!

108
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,858
Hey, your Cocoa Puffs
are gettin' soggy.

109
00:17:48,277 --> 00:17:52,156
Let me see you.
Oh, honey, you got a spot.

110
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:54,160
Head up.

111
00:17:59,373 --> 00:18:02,043
Okay, here we go.

112
00:18:16,186 --> 00:18:18,313
Something you were
looking for, baby?

113
00:18:21,232 --> 00:18:23,151
Pop Tarts?

114
00:18:25,197 --> 00:18:27,157
They're right here.

115
00:18:28,533 --> 00:18:30,494
Oh.

116
00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:38,963
Well, what are you
thinking, Mama?

117
00:18:40,756 --> 00:18:44,011
Lots of things.

118
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:46,263
Anything bad about me?

119
00:18:46,347 --> 00:18:49,308
Hey, look at my face.

120
00:18:49,392 --> 00:18:52,103
I was not thinking
something bad about you.

121
00:18:53,312 --> 00:18:55,233
Got it?

122
00:18:57,485 --> 00:18:59,445
Got it.

123
00:19:00,947 --> 00:19:02,907
Here, head up.

124
00:19:02,949 --> 00:19:05,120
- That's Tommy.
- That's okay. You tuck it in.

125
00:19:05,203 --> 00:19:07,706
Cole, you want this?

126
00:19:38,035 --> 00:19:41,496
Hey, freak, how'd you like that
"arm around the shoulder" bit?

127
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,209
I just made that up.
I went with it.

128
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:46,879
It's what great actors do.
It's called "improve."

129
00:20:25,675 --> 00:20:28,011
Hey, baby.

130
00:20:28,053 --> 00:20:30,013
How was your day?

131
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:34,311
Hmm?

132
00:20:37,439 --> 00:20:39,858
You know, you can tell me things
If you need to.

133
00:20:45,324 --> 00:20:48,452
Well, you know
what I did today?

134
00:20:48,494 --> 00:20:53,584
I, uh, I won the Pennsylvania Lottery
in the morning,

135
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,587
I quit my jobs,

136
00:20:55,671 --> 00:21:00,634
and I ate a big picnic in the park
with lots of chocolate mousse pie.

137
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:04,098
And then I swam
in the fountain all afternoon.

138
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,100
What'd you do?

139
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,986
I was picked first for
kick ball teams at recess.

140
00:21:15,069 --> 00:21:16,988
I hit a grand slam
to win the game.

141
00:21:17,071 --> 00:21:21,117
Everybody lifted me up on their shoulders
and carried me around, cheering.

142
00:21:25,999 --> 00:21:29,043
Well, in that case, I am gonna
make you some triangle pancakes.

143
00:21:30,128 --> 00:21:32,088
You got an hour.

144
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:40,098
Hi.

145
00:21:44,104 --> 00:21:46,481
Wanna sit?

146
00:21:51,069 --> 00:21:53,322
Don't feel like talking today?

147
00:21:57,077 --> 00:21:59,038
Wanna play a game?

148
00:22:00,748 --> 00:22:03,000
It's a mind- reading game.

149
00:22:03,042 --> 00:22:05,087
Here's how it works.

150
00:22:05,171 --> 00:22:07,590
I read your mind.

151
00:22:07,673 --> 00:22:10,968
If what I say is right, you take
one step towards the chair.

152
00:22:11,052 --> 00:22:15,058
If what I say is wrong,
you take one step back...

153
00:22:15,141 --> 00:22:17,060
towards the doorway.

154
00:22:17,143 --> 00:22:20,730
If you reach the chair,
you sit down.

155
00:22:20,813 --> 00:22:24,653
If you reach the door,
you can go.

156
00:22:26,196 --> 00:22:28,156
Wanna play?

157
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:37,335
Okay.

158
00:22:53,019 --> 00:22:56,441
When your mother and father
were first divorced,

159
00:22:56,483 --> 00:23:00,821
your mom went to see a doctor
like me, and he didn't help her.

160
00:23:00,904 --> 00:23:04,034
So you think I'm not going
to be able to help you.

161
00:23:20,052 --> 00:23:24,726
You're worried that she said
she told him things--

162
00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:27,103
things she couldn't tell
anyone else.

163
00:23:28,438 --> 00:23:30,398
Secrets.

164
00:23:37,615 --> 00:23:39,868
You have a secret,
but you don't want to tell me.

165
00:23:53,175 --> 00:23:57,306
Your dad gave you that watch
as a present just before he went away.

166
00:24:08,152 --> 00:24:10,572
He forgot it in a drawer.

167
00:24:10,614 --> 00:24:12,574
Doesn't work.

168
00:24:24,632 --> 00:24:28,052
You keep pretty quiet
in school, but...

169
00:24:28,094 --> 00:24:32,932
you're a good student, you've never
really been in any serious trouble.

170
00:24:40,274 --> 00:24:42,235
We were supposed
to draw a picture.

171
00:24:42,276 --> 00:24:44,447
Anything we wanted.

172
00:24:47,367 --> 00:24:50,370
I drew a man.

173
00:24:50,453 --> 00:24:53,415
He got hurt in the neck by
another man with a screwdriver.

174
00:24:57,087 --> 00:24:59,798
You saw that on TV, Cole?

175
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:05,722
Everyone got upset.

176
00:25:06,807 --> 00:25:09,601
They had a meeting.

177
00:25:09,685 --> 00:25:11,603
Mom started crying.

178
00:25:11,687 --> 00:25:14,191
I don't draw
like that anymore.

179
00:25:16,318 --> 00:25:18,404
How do you draw now?

180
00:25:20,656 --> 00:25:24,036
I draw... people smiling,

181
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,122
dogs running,

182
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,500
rainbows.

183
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:33,798
They don't have meetings
about rainbows.

184
00:25:34,924 --> 00:25:38,178
No. I guess they don't.

185
00:25:47,063 --> 00:25:49,650
What am I thinking now?

186
00:25:49,734 --> 00:25:53,279
I don't know
what you're thinking now.

187
00:25:59,621 --> 00:26:01,456
I was thinking...

188
00:26:01,539 --> 00:26:03,500
you're nice,

189
00:26:05,962 --> 00:26:08,006
but you can't help me.

190
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:28,197
I thought you meant the other Italian
restaurant I asked you to marry me in.

191
00:26:35,373 --> 00:26:37,291
I'm so sorry, Anna.

192
00:26:38,709 --> 00:26:41,379
I just can't seem
to keep track of time.

193
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:47,053
And I didn't have
a very good session today.

194
00:26:51,432 --> 00:26:54,312
They're both so similar.

195
00:26:54,396 --> 00:26:58,775
The same mannerisms, same expressions,
same things hanging over their head.

196
00:27:02,195 --> 00:27:04,700
I think it might be
some kind of abuse.

197
00:27:05,742 --> 00:27:09,204
Cole has...
scratches on his arm.

198
00:27:09,246 --> 00:27:11,873
I think they might be
fingernail cuts.

199
00:27:11,957 --> 00:27:14,295
Defensive cuts, maybe.
I don't know.

200
00:27:15,538 --> 00:27:18,958
Maybe a teacher or a neighbor.

201
00:27:19,541 --> 00:27:24,298
I don't think it's the mother. I've seen her
with him, and it doesn't seem to fit.

202
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,679
Or I could just be wrong.

203
00:27:29,763 --> 00:27:32,808
Maybe he's just a kid
who likes to climb trees a lot.

204
00:27:41,235 --> 00:27:43,445
Anna.

205
00:27:44,865 --> 00:27:47,827
I know that I've been
a little distant, all right?

206
00:27:47,868 --> 00:27:51,080
I know that it makes you mad.
I just...

207
00:27:51,163 --> 00:27:55,211
feel like I'm being given a second chance,
and I don't want it to slip away.

208
00:27:56,295 --> 00:27:58,506
Anna.

209
00:28:00,508 --> 00:28:02,426
Happy anniversary.

210
00:28:12,188 --> 00:28:14,150
Stop looking at me.

211
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:17,070
I don't like when people
look at me like that.

212
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:19,739
Okay.

213
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:23,786
I walk this way to school
with Tommy Tammisimo.

214
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,831
Is he your best buddy?

215
00:28:25,873 --> 00:28:27,833
He hates me.

216
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:30,335
Do you hate him?

217
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:32,462
No.

218
00:28:33,923 --> 00:28:36,176
Did your mom set that up?

219
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,178
Yes.

220
00:28:39,972 --> 00:28:42,516
Did you ever talk to your mom
about how things are with Tommy?

221
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,730
- I don't tell her things.
- Why not?

222
00:28:45,813 --> 00:28:48,482
'Cause she doesn't look at me like
everybody else, and I don't want her to.

223
00:28:48,566 --> 00:28:51,277
- I don't want her to know.
- Know what?

224
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,780
That I'm a freak.

225
00:28:53,864 --> 00:28:55,992
Hey.

226
00:28:56,075 --> 00:29:00,038
You are not a freak. Okay?

227
00:29:00,121 --> 00:29:04,920
Don't you believe anybody that tries to
convince you of that. That's bullshit.

228
00:29:04,961 --> 00:29:07,380
You don't have to go through
your life believing that.

229
00:29:09,091 --> 00:29:11,010
Okay?

230
00:29:13,429 --> 00:29:15,391
Come on.

231
00:29:18,645 --> 00:29:22,732
- You said the "S" word.
- Yeah, I know.

232
00:29:22,774 --> 00:29:24,736
Sorry.

233
00:30:31,857 --> 00:30:34,278
So your dad lives in Pittsburgh with a lady...

234
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:36,655
that works in a tollbooth?

235
00:30:38,782 --> 00:30:42,119
I wonder if she has to pee
when she's working.

236
00:30:42,161 --> 00:30:44,248
Think she just holds it?

237
00:30:44,331 --> 00:30:47,626
I don't know. I was just
thinking about that myself.

238
00:30:49,337 --> 00:30:51,423
You asked a lot of questions
about Dad today.

239
00:30:51,465 --> 00:30:53,717
How come?

240
00:30:53,801 --> 00:30:57,556
Well, sometimes we do things
to draw attention,

241
00:30:57,639 --> 00:31:02,770
to express our feelings
about certain issues--

242
00:31:02,853 --> 00:31:06,233
divorce, whatever.

243
00:31:06,317 --> 00:31:10,029
For example, a person might leave something
on the desk for someone else to find.

244
00:31:14,577 --> 00:31:17,121
Do you know what free
association writing is, Cole?

245
00:31:18,414 --> 00:31:20,458
No.

246
00:31:20,541 --> 00:31:24,798
Free association writing
is when you take a pencil in your hand,

247
00:31:24,881 --> 00:31:30,261
and you put the pencil to apiece
of paper and you start writing.

248
00:31:30,345 --> 00:31:33,056
And you don't look at what you're writing or
think about what you're writing.

249
00:31:33,098 --> 00:31:36,478
You just keep
Your hand moving.

250
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:40,324
And after a while, if you keep
Your hand moving long enough,

251
00:31:40,707 --> 00:31:44,129
words and thoughts start coming out that
you didn't even know you had in you.

252
00:31:44,254 --> 00:31:49,635
It could be something
you heard somewhere else,

253
00:31:49,718 --> 00:31:53,013
or feelings you had
deep inside of you.

254
00:31:56,685 --> 00:31:59,271
Have you ever done any
free association writing, Cole?

255
00:32:03,067 --> 00:32:05,029
Yes.

256
00:32:05,071 --> 00:32:07,156
What did you write?

257
00:32:08,699 --> 00:32:10,618
Upset words.

258
00:32:12,411 --> 00:32:15,833
Did you ever write any upset words
before your father left?

259
00:32:17,252 --> 00:32:19,170
I don't remember.

260
00:32:21,214 --> 00:32:23,299
Can you do something for me?

261
00:32:25,595 --> 00:32:29,517
I want you to think about what you
wanna get out of our time together--

262
00:32:29,558 --> 00:32:31,519
what our goal should be.

263
00:32:32,687 --> 00:32:34,691
Something I want?

264
00:32:36,442 --> 00:32:39,153
If you could change something
in your life, anything at all,

265
00:32:39,237 --> 00:32:41,155
what would it be?

266
00:32:41,239 --> 00:32:44,536
Instead of something I want,
can it be something I don't want?

267
00:32:46,246 --> 00:32:48,206
Okay.

268
00:32:49,291 --> 00:32:51,751
I don't want to be
scared anymore.

269
00:33:04,143 --> 00:33:06,103
You gonna get that?

270
00:33:12,943 --> 00:33:15,156
Are you gonna get that?

271
00:33:19,744 --> 00:33:21,954
- Hi.
- Hi.

272
00:33:22,038 --> 00:33:24,625
- Don't you see enough of me at the store?
- Yeah, I'm on my way out...

273
00:33:24,709 --> 00:33:26,627
to the flea market
in the Amish country.

274
00:33:26,711 --> 00:33:28,629
I thought maybe you'd
wanna come along...

275
00:33:28,713 --> 00:33:31,466
and show me how to buy
at one of these things.

276
00:33:31,549 --> 00:33:34,304
I don't know if I can deal
with the Amish today.

277
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:37,974
You can't curse or spit
or anything around them.

278
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:40,935
I just figured maybe you'd just want to
get out and get some air,

279
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:43,355
because you've seemed
kind of down lately.

280
00:33:44,775 --> 00:33:47,361
Um, I'm okay.

281
00:33:49,237 --> 00:33:52,115
Do you think that maybe I should stop by
on the way back, show you what I got?

282
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:54,495
Because that
wouldn't be a problem.

283
00:33:54,578 --> 00:33:57,998
No, I- You know,
I can see on Monday.

284
00:33:58,082 --> 00:34:01,085
Sure, yeah, that's fine.
I'm just--

285
00:34:01,168 --> 00:34:04,799
Okay, so I guess I'm gonna get going
then. I'll speak to you later.

286
00:34:04,882 --> 00:34:07,718
- Don't step in the horse manure.
- Thank you very much.

287
00:34:17,773 --> 00:34:20,234
Keep moving, cheese dick.

288
00:34:44,012 --> 00:34:48,810
Can anybody guess what city was capital
of the United States of America...

289
00:34:48,893 --> 00:34:53,189
from 1790 to 1800?

290
00:34:56,153 --> 00:34:59,739
I'll give you a hint:
It's the city you live in.

291
00:34:59,823 --> 00:35:02,784
- Philadelphia!
- Right, right.

292
00:35:02,826 --> 00:35:05,372
Philadelphia's one of the oldest cities
in this country.

293
00:35:05,456 --> 00:35:07,791
A lot of generations
have lived here and died here.

294
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:12,463
Almost any place you go in this city
has a history and a story behind it.

295
00:35:12,546 --> 00:35:15,593
Even this school
and the grounds it sits on.

296
00:35:15,676 --> 00:35:20,264
Can anyone guess what this building
was used for a hundred years ago...

297
00:35:20,347 --> 00:35:24,228
before you went to school here,
before I went to this school even?

298
00:35:31,736 --> 00:35:33,654
Yes, Cole.

299
00:35:36,034 --> 00:35:38,077
They used to hang people here.

300
00:35:42,916 --> 00:35:46,463
No, uh, that--Mm- mm. That's
not correct. Where'd you hear that?

301
00:35:46,746 --> 00:35:51,836
They pulled the people in, crying
and kissing their families bye.

302
00:35:51,919 --> 00:35:55,758
People watching...
spit at them.

303
00:35:57,593 --> 00:36:01,931
Uh, Cole, this building
was a legal courthouse.

304
00:36:02,014 --> 00:36:05,437
Laws were passed here--some of
the very first laws of this country.

305
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,731
This whole building
was full of, uh, lawyers,

306
00:36:07,772 --> 00:36:11,025
- lawmakers.
- They were the ones that hanged everybody.

307
00:36:13,236 --> 00:36:15,198
Uh--

308
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,993
I don't know which one
of these guys told you that,

309
00:36:18,076 --> 00:36:21,163
but, uh, they were
Just trying to scare you.

310
00:36:31,091 --> 00:36:34,011
I don't like people
looking at me like that.

311
00:36:35,389 --> 00:36:37,349
Like what?

312
00:36:37,391 --> 00:36:39,518
Stop it!

313
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:43,022
I, uh, I- I- I don't know
how else to look.

314
00:36:44,442 --> 00:36:46,360
You're Stuttering Stanley!

315
00:36:49,197 --> 00:36:52,158
- Excuse me?
- You talked funny when you went to school here.

316
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,996
You talked funny
all the way to high school.

317
00:36:55,038 --> 00:36:59,167
- What?
- You shouldn't look at people. It makes them feel bad.

318
00:36:59,209 --> 00:37:02,170
- How did you--
- Stop looking at me!

319
00:37:02,212 --> 00:37:05,258
Who have you-- been speaking to?

320
00:37:05,342 --> 00:37:07,886
Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering Stanley!

321
00:37:07,969 --> 00:37:10,222
- Stop it. St- St- St--
- Stuttering Stanley!

322
00:37:10,305 --> 00:37:13,975
- Stop that!
- Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!

323
00:37:14,059 --> 00:37:18,148
Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering Stanley!

324
00:37:18,232 --> 00:37:21,610
Shut up, you f- f- freak!

325
00:37:36,672 --> 00:37:38,590
Hey, big guy.

326
00:37:43,262 --> 00:37:45,224
How's it goin'?

327
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:47,601
I don't wanna talk about
anything right now.

328
00:37:47,685 --> 00:37:49,603
Okay.

329
00:38:04,372 --> 00:38:07,000
You like magic?

330
00:38:07,041 --> 00:38:09,002
Hmm?

331
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:16,136
Observe:
The magic penny.

332
00:38:16,219 --> 00:38:19,472
Looks like an ordinary penny.

333
00:38:19,514 --> 00:38:22,017
But I do my little
magic shake, and...

334
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,564
now it's in my right hand.

335
00:38:25,647 --> 00:38:27,566
But that's not the end
of the magic trick.

336
00:38:29,151 --> 00:38:31,820
I do another
little shake, and...

337
00:38:34,324 --> 00:38:36,076
right there
in the vest pocket.

338
00:38:37,661 --> 00:38:40,039
But that's not the end
of the magic trick.

339
00:38:40,122 --> 00:38:42,625
I do another little shake...

340
00:38:42,708 --> 00:38:44,670
and...

341
00:38:46,213 --> 00:38:49,216
right back in the left hand
where it started.

342
00:38:50,927 --> 00:38:52,845
That isn't magic.

343
00:38:52,929 --> 00:38:56,768
What are you talking about?
Of course it's magic.

344
00:38:56,809 --> 00:38:59,437
You just kept the penny
in that hand the whole time.

345
00:39:04,193 --> 00:39:06,112
Think so?

346
00:39:07,656 --> 00:39:10,743
I didn't know you were funny.

347
00:39:24,259 --> 00:39:27,555
Malcolm, sit your cute
butt down and listen up.

348
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:32,560
No doubt about it.
Anna is like my sister.

349
00:39:32,644 --> 00:39:36,733
And you better make her happy.
I'm not talkin' about no...

350
00:39:36,775 --> 00:39:39,236
"Mmm, this taste like
real butter" kind of happy.

351
00:39:39,319 --> 00:39:42,280
I'm talkin' about--
What's up, girl?

352
00:39:42,364 --> 00:39:44,952
"Julie Andrews
twirling around like...

353
00:39:45,035 --> 00:39:47,454
a mental patient on a mountaintop"
kind of happy.

354
00:39:47,538 --> 00:39:50,708
That's the kind of happy
I'm talkin' about.

355
00:39:50,791 --> 00:39:52,751
Shh. Come here.

356
00:39:52,835 --> 00:39:55,339
Don't tell her I told you,

357
00:39:55,423 --> 00:39:58,843
but she said
she knew she love you...

358
00:39:58,884 --> 00:40:01,762
from the first time
she met you on the street.

359
00:40:03,055 --> 00:40:07,353
She'd do anything for you.

360
00:40:07,437 --> 00:40:09,397
I love you guys.

361
00:40:12,358 --> 00:40:14,278
My nose is running.
Turn it--

362
00:41:33,623 --> 00:41:35,836
And then you do
the magic shake.

363
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,339
The penny has moved
from my pocket...

364
00:41:39,422 --> 00:41:41,591
all the way back
to the hand it started in.

365
00:41:44,429 --> 00:41:46,348
That's stupid.

366
00:41:48,475 --> 00:41:50,978
It's supposed
to be funny.

367
00:41:51,061 --> 00:41:54,399
It's stupid.
I want my penny back.

368
00:41:57,069 --> 00:42:00,447
He doesn't get invited places, so it's our pleasure.

369
00:42:00,531 --> 00:42:04,034
Last time was a Chuck E. Cheese
party a year ago.

370
00:42:04,076 --> 00:42:08,249
He hid in one of those purple plastic
tunnels and didn't come out.

371
00:42:08,332 --> 00:42:11,335
- Chucky who?
- Cheese. It's a kids place.

372
00:42:11,419 --> 00:42:14,339
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

373
00:42:48,882 --> 00:42:52,093
Is someone out there?

374
00:42:52,177 --> 00:42:54,514
Open this door, please.
Come on.

375
00:42:54,598 --> 00:42:59,478
I can't breathe.
If you can hear me, open this door.

376
00:42:59,561 --> 00:43:03,732
I swear on my life I didn't
take the master's horse.

377
00:43:03,815 --> 00:43:07,488
Open this door, or I'll
break through it and grab you!

378
00:43:07,571 --> 00:43:12,076
- The star of the commercial always gets his own trailer.
- For what?

379
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:15,248
He needs a place to think
about his character, alone.

380
00:43:15,331 --> 00:43:17,625
You only had one line.

381
00:43:20,253 --> 00:43:22,380
Derrick, check it out.

382
00:43:22,463 --> 00:43:24,717
Oh, yeah.

383
00:43:24,801 --> 00:43:27,053
My dad
made me invite him.

384
00:43:45,325 --> 00:43:47,953
Happy birthday, Derrick.

385
00:43:48,036 --> 00:43:50,247
Is there somethin'
you want to see in there?

386
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:52,708
No.

387
00:43:54,878 --> 00:43:56,880
We're gonna put on
a pretend play.

388
00:43:56,922 --> 00:44:01,093
- Wanna be in it?
- Okay.

389
00:44:01,176 --> 00:44:04,682
It's called
" Locked in the Dungeon."

390
00:44:04,765 --> 00:44:08,102
Yes, Cole, and, uh, you get to be
the one locked in the dungeon.

391
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:15,070
Don't! Don't!
Don't! Don't!

392
00:44:15,154 --> 00:44:17,781
Don't!

393
00:44:17,906 --> 00:44:19,700
Let me out! No! No!

394
00:44:19,783 --> 00:44:22,077
No! No!

395
00:44:45,023 --> 00:44:47,442
Cole?

396
00:44:50,278 --> 00:44:53,156
Cole!

397
00:44:53,239 --> 00:44:56,119
Is there a key
for this door?

398
00:44:56,203 --> 00:44:59,081
Cole? Honey?
Honey, can you hear me?

399
00:45:02,626 --> 00:45:05,381
Oh, my God! Cole!

400
00:45:05,422 --> 00:45:09,968
Help me! Help!
Help! Help!

401
00:45:21,774 --> 00:45:24,487
The tests would indicate
he did not have a seizure.

402
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:26,989
He's doing fine.

403
00:45:27,073 --> 00:45:29,534
After some rest,
he can go home tonight.

404
00:45:35,041 --> 00:45:39,254
There's some cuts and
bruises on your son...

405
00:45:39,337 --> 00:45:42,340
- that are concerning me.
- Oh, man.

406
00:45:44,469 --> 00:45:46,388
Yeah, those are from sports.

407
00:45:52,478 --> 00:45:54,398
You think I hurt my child?

408
00:45:58,236 --> 00:46:00,196
You think I'm a bad mother?

409
00:46:00,238 --> 00:46:03,283
Mrs. Sloan over there,

410
00:46:03,366 --> 00:46:05,954
she's a social worker
with the hospital.

411
00:46:06,037 --> 00:46:08,832
She's gonna ask you a couple
procedural questions.

412
00:46:09,875 --> 00:46:12,461
What happened
to my child today?

413
00:46:12,544 --> 00:46:17,843
Something was happening to him, physically happening.
Something was very wrong!

414
00:46:22,264 --> 00:46:24,184
Hey.

415
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:37,950
Did your father used to
tell you bedtime stories?

416
00:46:48,505 --> 00:46:51,633
Once upon a time
there was this young prince,

417
00:46:51,716 --> 00:46:56,389
and he decided that
he wanted to go for a drive.

418
00:46:56,473 --> 00:47:01,561
He go this driver,
and they started driving.

419
00:47:01,603 --> 00:47:04,691
Driving, driving.

420
00:47:04,775 --> 00:47:07,236
Driving a lot.

421
00:47:07,277 --> 00:47:09,905
And, uh,

422
00:47:09,947 --> 00:47:13,617
they drove so much
that he fell asleep.

423
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,621
And--

424
00:47:18,791 --> 00:47:22,753
Then he woke up, and he realized
they were still driving.

425
00:47:22,836 --> 00:47:25,174
- This was a very long trip.
- Dr. Crowe?

426
00:47:26,759 --> 00:47:29,680
You haven't told
bedtime stories before.

427
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:31,974
Uh, not too many, no.

428
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:34,520
You have to add
some twists and stuff.

429
00:47:36,272 --> 00:47:38,440
Okay. Some twists.

430
00:47:40,067 --> 00:47:43,362
Like what kind of twists?
Give me an example.

431
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:48,703
- Maybe they run out of gas.
- They run out of gas?

432
00:47:48,786 --> 00:47:51,872
That's good, 'cause they're driving,
right? Okay, so--

433
00:47:51,956 --> 00:47:54,334
Tell me the story
about why you're sad.

434
00:47:57,338 --> 00:47:59,257
You think I'm sad?

435
00:48:02,218 --> 00:48:04,178
What makes you think that?

436
00:48:06,349 --> 00:48:08,351
Your eyes told me.

437
00:48:10,145 --> 00:48:12,731
Not supposed to talk
about stuff like that.

438
00:48:24,203 --> 00:48:27,249
Once upon a time, there was
this person named Malcolm.

439
00:48:27,333 --> 00:48:29,793
He worked with children.

440
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:33,964
He loved it.

441
00:48:34,048 --> 00:48:37,011
He loved it
more than anything else.

442
00:48:39,555 --> 00:48:41,474
And then one night,
he found out that...

443
00:48:41,557 --> 00:48:44,729
he made a mistake
with one of them.

444
00:48:44,812 --> 00:48:47,398
He couldn't help that one.

445
00:48:48,983 --> 00:48:51,611
And he can't stop
thinking about it.

446
00:48:51,653 --> 00:48:53,946
He can't forget.

447
00:48:57,118 --> 00:48:59,454
Ever since then,
things have been different.

448
00:49:01,206 --> 00:49:04,210
He's not the same person
that he used to be.

449
00:49:05,962 --> 00:49:08,256
And his wife...

450
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:12,053
doesn't like the person
that he's become.

451
00:49:12,095 --> 00:49:14,724
They barely speak anymore.
They're like strangers.

452
00:49:18,186 --> 00:49:21,856
And then one day, Malcolm meets
this wonderful little boy.

453
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:25,612
A really cool little boy.

454
00:49:25,696 --> 00:49:28,240
Reminds him a lot
of the other one.

455
00:49:30,909 --> 00:49:34,037
And Malcolm decides
to try and help this new boy...

456
00:49:36,208 --> 00:49:40,713
'cause he feels that
if he can help this new boy,

457
00:49:40,754 --> 00:49:45,511
it will be like...
helping that other one too.

458
00:49:47,972 --> 00:49:50,683
How does the story end?

459
00:49:52,518 --> 00:49:54,438
I don't know.

460
00:50:11,666 --> 00:50:14,880
I wanna tell you my secret now.

461
00:50:19,593 --> 00:50:21,511
Okay.

462
00:50:28,562 --> 00:50:31,106
I see dead people.

463
00:50:33,734 --> 00:50:35,654
I n your dreams?

464
00:50:37,823 --> 00:50:39,867
While you're awake?

465
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:49,295
Dead people, like,
in graves, in coffins?

466
00:50:49,378 --> 00:50:52,633
Walking around
like regular people.

467
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:56,263
They don't see each other.

468
00:50:56,305 --> 00:50:59,058
They only see
what they wanna see.

469
00:51:00,309 --> 00:51:03,312
They don't know they're dead.

470
00:51:04,857 --> 00:51:07,151
How often do you see them?

471
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:13,074
All the time.

472
00:51:15,495 --> 00:51:17,622
They're everywhere.

473
00:51:20,416 --> 00:51:23,503
You won't tell anyone
my secret, right?

474
00:51:23,586 --> 00:51:26,007
No. I promise.

475
00:51:28,176 --> 00:51:30,971
Will you stay here
until I fall asleep?

476
00:51:33,265 --> 00:51:35,561
Of course.

477
00:51:45,739 --> 00:51:51,161
Cole has pathologies more
severe than initially assessed.

478
00:51:52,329 --> 00:51:55,167
He's suffering from
visual hallucinations,

479
00:51:55,251 --> 00:51:58,004
paranoia,

480
00:51:58,045 --> 00:52:02,174
some kind of...
school- age schizophrenia.

481
00:52:04,261 --> 00:52:07,599
Medication, hospitalization
may be required.

482
00:52:14,188 --> 00:52:16,276
And I'm not helping him.

483
00:53:43,714 --> 00:53:46,385
Hi, this is Lynn Sear,
Cole's mom.

484
00:53:48,012 --> 00:53:50,681
Yeah, uh, I--
I'd like to talk to you...

485
00:53:50,764 --> 00:53:55,604
about your boy and his friends keeping
their goddamn hands off my son.

486
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,641
Mama?

487
00:55:35,892 --> 00:55:39,229
No, dinner
is not ready!

488
00:55:39,271 --> 00:55:41,940
What are you
gonna do?

489
00:55:42,023 --> 00:55:45,487
You can't hurt me
anymore!

490
00:55:45,571 --> 00:55:48,866
Neddy! You're a terrible
husband, Neddy!

491
00:55:48,907 --> 00:55:51,911
Look what you made me do!
Neddy!

492
00:56:11,393 --> 00:56:13,687
Once there was a boy,

493
00:56:13,729 --> 00:56:16,233
very different
from all the other boys.

494
00:56:16,317 --> 00:56:20,237
He lived in the jungle,

495
00:56:20,321 --> 00:56:23,908
and he could speak
to the animals.

496
00:56:38,218 --> 00:56:40,470
Did you think the play
sucked big time?

497
00:56:40,553 --> 00:56:43,765
What?

498
00:56:43,848 --> 00:56:47,270
Tommy Tammisimo acted
in a cough syrup commercial.

499
00:56:47,354 --> 00:56:50,106
He said everyone was self- conscious
and unrealistic.

500
00:56:50,148 --> 00:56:52,234
He said the play
sucked big time.

501
00:56:52,317 --> 00:56:54,988
This Tommy kid sounds
like a real punk.

502
00:56:57,032 --> 00:57:00,786
I thought the play was excellent.
Better than "Cats. "

503
00:57:00,869 --> 00:57:03,372
- "Cats"?
- Never mind.

504
00:57:06,126 --> 00:57:09,255
Cole, I was really interested
in what you told me at the hospital.

505
00:57:09,338 --> 00:57:11,924
I'd like to hear
more about it.

506
00:57:22,019 --> 00:57:24,481
Cole?

507
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:29,320
What?

508
00:57:41,711 --> 00:57:44,924
Is something
up there?

509
00:57:48,261 --> 00:57:51,389
Cole,

510
00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:56,563
I don't
see anything.

511
00:58:00,358 --> 00:58:03,570
Be real still.

512
00:58:06,992 --> 00:58:09,244
Sometimes you
feel it inside,

513
00:58:09,328 --> 00:58:12,164
like you're falling down
real fast,

514
00:58:12,205 --> 00:58:15,210
but you're really
Just standing still.

515
00:58:19,798 --> 00:58:24,053
You ever feel the prickly things
on the back of your neck?

516
00:58:24,136 --> 00:58:27,016
Yes.

517
00:58:27,099 --> 00:58:30,978
And the tiny hairs on your arm,
you know, when they stand up?

518
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:33,647
Yes.

519
00:58:35,318 --> 00:58:38,071
That's them.

520
00:58:40,698 --> 00:58:43,034
When they get mad,

521
00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:49,459
it gets cold.

522
00:59:06,021 --> 00:59:09,776
I don't see anything.
Are you sure they're there?

523
00:59:11,444 --> 00:59:13,905
Cole?

524
00:59:15,659 --> 00:59:18,453
Please make them leave.

525
00:59:18,495 --> 00:59:20,997
I'm workin' on it.

526
00:59:22,916 --> 00:59:25,379
Come on.

527
00:59:52,118 --> 00:59:54,998
Aah!

528
01:00:09,806 --> 01:00:13,268
Mommy, Daddy?

529
01:00:15,439 --> 01:00:17,900
My throat hurts.

530
01:00:26,368 --> 01:00:28,329
Run! Run!

531
01:00:29,830 --> 01:00:31,749
Pedia Ease cough suppressant.

532
01:00:31,832 --> 01:00:36,088
- Gentle, fast, effect--
- Cole.

533
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:40,259
I don't care what they say,
this thing is broken.

534
01:00:48,269 --> 01:00:50,606
Take 'em off.

535
01:00:54,193 --> 01:00:56,948
I don't want them
on my table.

536
01:01:01,369 --> 01:01:04,414
I saw what was in your bureau drawer
when I was cleaning.

537
01:01:04,498 --> 01:01:06,417
Got something
you want to confess?

538
01:01:09,504 --> 01:01:13,091
Hmm?
The bumblebee pendant?

539
01:01:13,174 --> 01:01:15,720
Why do you
keep taking it?

540
01:01:19,474 --> 01:01:21,685
It was Grandma's.

541
01:01:21,768 --> 01:01:24,940
You know, what if it broke?
You know how sad I'd be.

542
01:01:27,234 --> 01:01:29,945
You'd cry 'cause you
miss Grandma so much.

543
01:01:31,321 --> 01:01:33,782
That's right.

544
01:01:37,496 --> 01:01:41,083
Sometimes people think
they lose things,

545
01:01:43,002 --> 01:01:46,757
and they really didn't lose them--
it just gets moved.

546
01:01:46,841 --> 01:01:49,135
So, did you move
the bumblebee pendant?

547
01:01:57,604 --> 01:01:59,731
Don't get mad.

548
01:01:59,772 --> 01:02:01,816
So, who moved it
this time?

549
01:02:01,899 --> 01:02:05,572
Maybe someone came in our house, took
the bumblebee pendant out of my closet...

550
01:02:05,614 --> 01:02:07,907
and placed it nicely
in your drawer.

551
01:02:09,159 --> 01:02:12,537
- Maybe.
- God, I am so tired, Cole.

552
01:02:12,579 --> 01:02:15,083
I'm tired in my body,
I'm tired in my mind,

553
01:02:15,167 --> 01:02:18,170
I'm... tired
in my heart.

554
01:02:18,253 --> 01:02:20,339
I need some help.

555
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:24,636
You know, I don't know if you noticed,
but our little family isn't doing so good.

556
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:26,680
I mean,
I've been praying,

557
01:02:26,722 --> 01:02:29,851
but I must not
be praying right.

558
01:02:29,893 --> 01:02:32,771
Looks like we're just gonna have to
answer each other's prayers.

559
01:02:36,401 --> 01:02:39,196
If we can't talk to each other,
we're not gonna make it.

560
01:02:43,033 --> 01:02:46,664
Now, tell me, baby.
I- I- I won't get mad, honey.

561
01:02:46,747 --> 01:02:49,333
Did you take
the bumblebee pendant?

562
01:02:57,843 --> 01:03:00,346
No.

563
01:03:02,014 --> 01:03:04,811
You've had enough roast beef.
You need to leave the table.

564
01:03:07,397 --> 01:03:09,607
Go!

565
01:03:32,467 --> 01:03:37,474
Hey, come on. I'll show you where
my dad keeps his gun. Come on.

566
01:03:42,688 --> 01:03:46,277
Sebastian, come on!

567
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:50,406
Mama?

568
01:03:54,871 --> 01:03:57,582
If you're not very mad,

569
01:03:57,623 --> 01:04:00,209
can I sleep
in your bed tonight?

570
01:04:02,086 --> 01:04:04,631
Look at my face.

571
01:04:04,716 --> 01:04:07,594
I'm not very mad.

572
01:04:10,556 --> 01:04:14,311
Baby, why are you shaking?

573
01:04:15,563 --> 01:04:17,774
Cole, what's wrong?

574
01:04:17,857 --> 01:04:21,652
Oh, God,
please tell me!

575
01:04:21,736 --> 01:04:25,116
Oh, please.

576
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:28,953
Oh.

577
01:04:38,089 --> 01:04:41,009
It's Edwardian,
beautifully worked...

578
01:04:41,051 --> 01:04:46,141
with mine- cut diamonds
and an actual color Burmese sapphire.

579
01:04:46,225 --> 01:04:48,852
It's timeless.

580
01:04:48,936 --> 01:04:51,355
Oh.

581
01:04:51,396 --> 01:04:53,857
You, uh...

582
01:04:53,941 --> 01:04:56,695
got anything
a little plainer?

583
01:04:56,737 --> 01:05:01,492
Plainer? You want a plain ring to go with your plain fiance?
Is that how it is?

584
01:05:01,575 --> 01:05:05,456
No! Baby,
don't get in a tissy.

585
01:05:07,667 --> 01:05:12,338
Uh--
You're so beautiful.

586
01:05:12,421 --> 01:05:16,135
You're like a Burmese sapphire
all by yourself.

587
01:05:16,219 --> 01:05:19,055
- You don't need all that.
- Uh- huh.

588
01:05:19,138 --> 01:05:21,599
Why don't you
try it on...

589
01:05:21,683 --> 01:05:23,935
and see how you both feel about it.

590
01:05:29,192 --> 01:05:32,737
There. How does
that feel?

591
01:05:32,821 --> 01:05:37,119
I think this piece,
um, communicates a longing.

592
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:40,205
I imagine that the woman
who owned it...

593
01:05:40,289 --> 01:05:43,375
loved a man that she
couldn't be with.

594
01:05:44,837 --> 01:05:48,007
Did he have wavy hair
and chestnut eyes?

595
01:05:48,090 --> 01:05:52,178
- Huh?
- Um, I don't know, but...

596
01:05:52,262 --> 01:05:55,225
a lot of the pieces
in this store communicate,

597
01:05:55,309 --> 01:05:58,729
and I think you should choose
a piece that speaks to you.

598
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:04,987
I think maybe when people own things
and then they pass away,

599
01:06:05,070 --> 01:06:08,532
a part of themselves gets
printed on those things,

600
01:06:08,616 --> 01:06:12,328
like...
like fingerprints.

601
01:06:14,414 --> 01:06:16,500
I'll just
wrap it up.

602
01:06:23,382 --> 01:06:25,678
You don't need a guy
with a Master's.

603
01:06:25,762 --> 01:06:28,514
You need a wrestler with a neck
larger than his head.

604
01:06:28,598 --> 01:06:31,768
No, I need a wrestler with a Master's.

605
01:06:32,894 --> 01:06:35,440
- What's this?
- Happy birthday.

606
01:06:35,523 --> 01:06:37,901
- For me?
- Mm- hmm.

607
01:06:45,243 --> 01:06:49,539
It's a...
first edition.

608
01:06:49,581 --> 01:06:52,042
Wow.

609
01:06:52,125 --> 01:06:55,005
- You know, this is too much.
- No.

610
01:06:55,047 --> 01:06:57,049
Took it out of
your Christmas bonus.

611
01:06:57,091 --> 01:07:01,345
It's perfect, Anna.

612
01:07:01,428 --> 01:07:05,017
Thanks.

613
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:12,358
What do you want more than anything?

614
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,653
I don't know.

615
01:07:14,695 --> 01:07:17,490
I've told you what I want.

616
01:07:20,243 --> 01:07:22,161
I know what I want.

617
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:27,127
I want to be able to
talk to my wife again.

618
01:07:29,421 --> 01:07:32,758
The way we used to
talk to each other.

619
01:07:32,842 --> 01:07:35,471
Like there was no one else
in the world except us.

620
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:39,559
How are you gonna do that?

621
01:07:45,150 --> 01:07:47,068
Can't be your doctor
anymore.

622
01:07:47,152 --> 01:07:51,698
I haven't paid enough
attention to my family.

623
01:07:51,781 --> 01:07:53,867
Bad things happen
when you do that.

624
01:07:55,620 --> 01:07:58,040
Do you understand?

625
01:07:58,123 --> 01:08:02,044
- I'm going to transfer you. I know two psychologists.
- Don't fail me.

626
01:08:04,589 --> 01:08:07,176
Don't give up. You're the only one
who can help me, I know it.

627
01:08:08,886 --> 01:08:11,680
I can't help you.

628
01:08:12,848 --> 01:08:14,769
You--

629
01:08:14,852 --> 01:08:17,938
Someone else
can help you.

630
01:08:21,776 --> 01:08:24,781
You believe me, right?

631
01:08:28,117 --> 01:08:30,703
Dr. Crowe, you believe
my secret, right?

632
01:08:32,914 --> 01:08:35,752
I don't know how
to answer that, Cole.

633
01:08:45,931 --> 01:08:48,892
How can you help me...

634
01:08:48,934 --> 01:08:51,645
if you don't believe me?

635
01:08:55,317 --> 01:08:59,446
Some magic's real.

636
01:09:14,715 --> 01:09:18,720
Do you know why you're
afraid when you're alone?

637
01:09:18,846 --> 01:09:22,683
I do.
I do.

638
01:09:29,942 --> 01:09:33,988
I'm sorry, Vincent. I hope I
didn't leave you alone too long.

639
01:09:34,071 --> 01:09:37,285
Whew.
It's cold in here.

640
01:09:39,996 --> 01:09:43,416
Vincent,
why are you crying?

641
01:09:47,463 --> 01:09:50,800
You won't believe.

642
01:09:56,183 --> 01:10:00,270
Sorry, Vincent. I hope I didn't
leave you alone too long.

643
01:10:00,353 --> 01:10:03,481
Whew.
It's coldin here.

644
01:10:06,278 --> 01:10:09,281
Vincent--

645
01:10:09,323 --> 01:10:13,619
Whew.
It's cold in here.

646
01:10:19,084 --> 01:10:22,588
Nah, you know what? I never liked him either.

647
01:10:22,671 --> 01:10:25,218
When I was a kid,
I had this blood test done,

648
01:10:25,259 --> 01:10:29,764
and I threw up chili cheese fries allover this male nurse.

649
01:10:31,015 --> 01:10:33,809
Excuse me. Dr. Reed is on line two.

650
01:10:33,893 --> 01:10:36,606
Vincent, will you excuse me? I have to take this.

651
01:10:36,689 --> 01:10:38,983
- Just give me a minute, okay?
- Okay.

652
01:11:54,157 --> 01:11:56,453
No entiendes.

653
01:11:56,494 --> 01:11:59,122
Yo no quiero morir.

654
01:12:06,298 --> 01:12:08,216
Yo no quiero morir.

655
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:11,219
- Oh, my God.
- Yo no quiero morir!

656
01:12:17,144 --> 01:12:20,939
You been
running around?

657
01:12:23,233 --> 01:12:25,446
Make you
feel better?

658
01:12:26,864 --> 01:12:29,450
I like to run around.
It's good exercise.

659
01:12:33,413 --> 01:12:35,334
Do you want to ask me
questions now?

660
01:12:37,461 --> 01:12:41,131
Want to be a lance corporal in Company
"M" Third Battalion, Seventh Marines?

661
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:44,218
We're being dispatched
into the Quang Nam province.

662
01:12:45,201 --> 01:12:47,664
Maybe later.

663
01:12:49,958 --> 01:12:51,918
Something happened, didn't it?

664
01:12:55,130 --> 01:12:57,676
You wiggling out?

665
01:12:59,219 --> 01:13:02,264
Yes.
I think I am.

666
01:13:05,017 --> 01:13:08,314
Do you know what
"Yo no quiero morir" means?

667
01:13:08,397 --> 01:13:11,775
It's Spanish.
It means "I don't want to die. "

668
01:13:14,245 --> 01:13:16,833
What do you think these ghosts want
when they talk to you?

669
01:13:24,924 --> 01:13:27,095
I want you to
think about it, Cole.

670
01:13:28,638 --> 01:13:32,183
I want you to think about it
really carefully.

671
01:13:32,225 --> 01:13:34,936
What do you think
they want?

672
01:13:38,650 --> 01:13:43,029
- Just help.
- That's right. That's what I think too.

673
01:13:43,113 --> 01:13:45,534
They just want help,
even the scary ones.

674
01:13:45,617 --> 01:13:48,829
I think I might know a way
to make them go away.

675
01:13:48,871 --> 01:13:51,790
How?

676
01:13:51,874 --> 01:13:54,251
Listen to them.

677
01:13:55,713 --> 01:13:58,007
What if they
don't want help?

678
01:13:58,090 --> 01:14:01,510
What if they're just angry and they
Just want to hurt somebody?

679
01:14:01,552 --> 01:14:03,888
I don't think
that's the way it works.

680
01:14:03,971 --> 01:14:06,642
How do you know
for sure?

681
01:14:08,019 --> 01:14:10,814
I don't.

682
01:14:30,804 --> 01:14:33,974
Hey!

683
01:14:34,057 --> 01:14:37,021
Hey! Hey!

684
01:14:53,414 --> 01:14:57,587
What's happening?

685
01:14:57,670 --> 01:15:01,924
What's happening?

686
01:15:03,301 --> 01:15:06,556
Go!

687
01:15:17,861 --> 01:15:20,614
What's happening to you?

688
01:15:20,698 --> 01:15:23,909
Is someone hurting you?
I'll kick their ass.

689
01:15:23,993 --> 01:15:27,206
Cole, if they're hurting you--

690
01:15:39,637 --> 01:15:42,682
Mama, you sleep now.

691
01:17:49,295 --> 01:17:52,089
I'm feeling much better now.

692
01:17:56,554 --> 01:17:59,515
Do you want to tell me something?

693
01:18:35,349 --> 01:18:38,229
She came a long way
to visit me, didn't she?

694
01:18:39,647 --> 01:18:42,399
I guess she did.

695
01:19:28,331 --> 01:19:30,500
Can you get some water?

696
01:19:34,337 --> 01:19:36,300
That's her sister.

697
01:19:54,069 --> 01:19:58,492
You know, when I went through this
with my father's cancer--

698
01:19:58,534 --> 01:20:01,829
I just can't imagine a child
being in bed for two years.

699
01:20:01,913 --> 01:20:04,457
How many--
How many doctors?

700
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:07,462
- I think it was six.
- Six different doctors?

701
01:20:07,545 --> 01:20:09,923
I think so, yes.

702
01:20:15,763 --> 01:20:20,226
I just heard the, uh,
little one is falling ill now.

703
01:20:20,310 --> 01:20:22,646
God help them.

704
01:20:42,127 --> 01:20:44,630
Don't go home,
okay?

705
01:20:44,713 --> 01:20:47,176
I definitely won't.

706
01:21:42,409 --> 01:21:45,078
Aah!

707
01:22:45,569 --> 01:22:47,989
Mister?

708
01:22:50,992 --> 01:22:53,370
Excuse me, mister.

709
01:22:57,668 --> 01:23:00,170
Are you Kyra's daddy?

710
01:23:13,644 --> 01:23:17,233
It's for you.

711
01:23:17,275 --> 01:23:20,403
Sh- She wanted
to tell you something.

712
01:23:58,407 --> 01:24:00,993
Oh, no, here he comes.
He's coming my way. Psst!

713
01:24:05,624 --> 01:24:08,544
Would you like to dance?

714
01:24:08,586 --> 01:24:12,591
Well, actually,
I just came with my friends.

715
01:24:12,674 --> 01:24:15,135
Oh, well, how about this?

716
01:24:15,219 --> 01:24:18,641
We can dance for a little bit,
and if you don't like the way I dance,

717
01:24:18,724 --> 01:24:20,684
you can kick me.

718
01:24:20,768 --> 01:24:22,811
Oh, okay then.

719
01:25:32,895 --> 01:25:36,109
It's time for lunch, Kyra.

720
01:25:40,238 --> 01:25:42,949
- I'm feeling much better now.
- That's so great, honey.

721
01:25:43,033 --> 01:25:45,327
It's time for your food.

722
01:25:47,289 --> 01:25:49,583
Can I go outside
if I eat this?

723
01:25:49,624 --> 01:25:52,045
I don't know. You know how
you get sick in the afternoons.

724
01:25:52,086 --> 01:25:54,881
We'll see.

725
01:25:56,509 --> 01:26:00,388
Don't say that it tastes funny.
You know I don't like to hear that.

726
01:26:03,099 --> 01:26:07,356
Tami's mom called.

727
01:26:22,748 --> 01:26:25,167
You were
keeping her sick.

728
01:26:42,021 --> 01:26:44,732
You liked it, she said.

729
01:26:47,737 --> 01:26:50,824
She looked out
for you.

730
01:26:50,907 --> 01:26:53,201
Is Kyra coming back?

731
01:26:56,331 --> 01:26:59,251
Not anymore.

732
01:27:06,260 --> 01:27:08,554
I think that's enough.
That's enough makeup.

733
01:27:08,595 --> 01:27:11,223
Okay.

734
01:27:11,306 --> 01:27:14,977
- They're calling for the stable boy.
- We have to hurry!

735
01:27:18,482 --> 01:27:20,776
Who, uh-- Who were you talking to?

736
01:27:27,618 --> 01:27:30,705
Just practicing
my lines.

737
01:27:33,834 --> 01:27:36,630
Thanks for giving me this part,
Mr. Cunningham.

738
01:27:36,714 --> 01:27:40,468
You know, when I went to school here, there was
a terrible fire in this section of the theater.

739
01:27:40,551 --> 01:27:42,553
They rebuilt
the whole thing.

740
01:27:42,636 --> 01:27:45,557
Yeah, I know.

741
01:27:55,736 --> 01:28:00,658
Only he who is pure of heart
can take the sword from the stone.

742
01:28:00,700 --> 01:28:03,328
Let the boy try.

743
01:28:10,504 --> 01:28:13,548
He is a stable boy.
He cleans up after the horses.

744
01:28:13,632 --> 01:28:16,386
Silence, village idiot.

745
01:28:16,470 --> 01:28:19,264
Let the boy step forward.

746
01:28:46,673 --> 01:28:49,551
Hail, King Arthur!

747
01:28:54,264 --> 01:28:56,184
Yea!

748
01:29:21,590 --> 01:29:24,551
I thought you were really great in the play, Cole.

749
01:29:24,593 --> 01:29:26,763
- Really?
- Yeah.

750
01:29:26,847 --> 01:29:29,266
- You know what else?
- What?

751
01:29:29,549 --> 01:29:33,970
I thought Tommy Tammisimo sucked big time.

752
01:29:41,188 --> 01:29:44,566
I got an idea how you can talk
to your wife.

753
01:29:44,608 --> 01:29:47,905
Wait till she's asleep.

754
01:29:47,947 --> 01:29:51,492
Then she'll listen to you
and she won't even know it.

755
01:29:58,835 --> 01:30:02,046
I'm not gonna see you
anymore, am I?

756
01:30:04,131 --> 01:30:07,011
I think we said everything
we needed to say.

757
01:30:08,513 --> 01:30:11,516
Maybe it's time to say things
to someone closer to you.

758
01:30:13,518 --> 01:30:16,606
Maybe we can pretend like we're
gonna see each other tomorrow.

759
01:30:18,942 --> 01:30:21,278
Just for pretend.

760
01:30:27,536 --> 01:30:29,913
Okay.

761
01:30:34,084 --> 01:30:36,589
I'm gonna go now.

762
01:30:42,678 --> 01:30:45,014
I'll see you tomorrow, Cole.

763
01:31:12,214 --> 01:31:15,761
I'm okay, Officer.
I- I'm okay.

764
01:31:15,844 --> 01:31:18,097
I don't know
what happened.

765
01:31:23,436 --> 01:31:26,358
Hmm.

766
01:31:26,441 --> 01:31:29,569
Geez, I hope
nobody got hurt.

767
01:31:32,781 --> 01:31:35,910
You're very quiet.

768
01:31:35,993 --> 01:31:39,289
You're mad I missed
the play, aren't you?

769
01:31:39,373 --> 01:31:41,750
I have two jobs, baby.

770
01:31:41,833 --> 01:31:44,795
You know how important
they are for us.

771
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:49,301
I'd give anything
to have been there.

772
01:32:01,190 --> 01:32:03,484
I'm ready to communicate
with you now.

773
01:32:08,741 --> 01:32:10,785
Communicate?

774
01:32:12,328 --> 01:32:14,706
Tell you my secrets.

775
01:32:16,292 --> 01:32:18,753
What is it?

776
01:32:22,507 --> 01:32:25,301
You know the accident
up there?

777
01:32:25,385 --> 01:32:28,390
Yeah.

778
01:32:28,473 --> 01:32:30,559
Someone got hurt.

779
01:32:30,642 --> 01:32:32,854
They did?

780
01:32:32,937 --> 01:32:36,443
A lady.

781
01:32:36,526 --> 01:32:38,820
She died.

782
01:32:38,903 --> 01:32:41,322
Oh, my God.
What, you can see her?

783
01:32:42,782 --> 01:32:45,870
- Yes.
- Where is she?

784
01:32:49,416 --> 01:32:53,336
Standing next to
my window.

785
01:32:59,428 --> 01:33:02,389
Cole, you're
scaring me.

786
01:33:02,473 --> 01:33:04,767
They scare me too
sometimes.

787
01:33:07,396 --> 01:33:09,690
They?

788
01:33:12,568 --> 01:33:14,487
Ghosts.

789
01:33:18,868 --> 01:33:21,329
You see ghosts, Cole?

790
01:33:23,539 --> 01:33:26,377
They want me to
do things for them.

791
01:33:29,130 --> 01:33:31,341
They--
They talk to you?

792
01:33:31,382 --> 01:33:34,511
They tell you
to do things?

793
01:33:35,595 --> 01:33:38,517
They're the ones
that used to hurt me.

794
01:33:40,018 --> 01:33:42,813
What are you
thinking, Mama?

795
01:33:42,854 --> 01:33:47,486
- You think I'm a freak?
- Look at my face.

796
01:33:47,569 --> 01:33:50,531
I would never think that
about you. Ever.

797
01:33:51,865 --> 01:33:54,284
- Got it?
- Got it.

798
01:34:01,627 --> 01:34:03,671
Just let me think for a minute.

799
01:34:07,552 --> 01:34:09,637
Grandma says hi.

800
01:34:13,142 --> 01:34:16,272
She says she's sorry for
taking the bumblebee pendant.

801
01:34:16,355 --> 01:34:19,024
She just likes it a lot.

802
01:34:21,485 --> 01:34:25,364
- What?
- Grandma comes to visit me sometimes.

803
01:34:27,785 --> 01:34:30,538
Cole, that's very wrong.

804
01:34:30,621 --> 01:34:33,166
- Grandma's gone, you know that.
- I know.

805
01:34:33,249 --> 01:34:36,588
- She wanted me to tell you--
- Cole, please stop.

806
01:34:36,629 --> 01:34:39,424
She wanted me to tell you
she saw you dance.

807
01:34:41,050 --> 01:34:44,679
She said
when you were little,

808
01:34:44,762 --> 01:34:46,683
you and her had a fight...

809
01:34:46,766 --> 01:34:49,519
right before
your dance recital.

810
01:34:51,771 --> 01:34:56,486
You thought she didn't come to see you dance.

811
01:35:00,324 --> 01:35:02,701
She did.

812
01:35:08,042 --> 01:35:11,879
She hid in the back
so you wouldn't see.

813
01:35:11,921 --> 01:35:14,757
Sh- She said you were
like an angel.

814
01:35:19,388 --> 01:35:21,515
She said...

815
01:35:21,557 --> 01:35:25,061
you came to the place
where they buried her,

816
01:35:27,273 --> 01:35:29,734
asked her a question.

817
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:36,618
She said
the answer is...

818
01:35:36,701 --> 01:35:38,620
every day.

819
01:35:41,206 --> 01:35:43,708
What did you ask?

820
01:35:51,678 --> 01:35:54,889
Do--

821
01:35:54,973 --> 01:35:58,645
Do I make her proud?

822
01:36:01,147 --> 01:36:03,608
Mama.

823
01:36:32,977 --> 01:36:35,521
Hi, everybody.
As most of you know,

824
01:36:35,604 --> 01:36:38,234
I'm not used to doing this,

825
01:36:38,318 --> 01:36:41,946
and I promised Anna
that I'd try not to embarrass her.

826
01:36:42,030 --> 01:36:46,160
I'll leave that to her mother.

827
01:36:46,243 --> 01:36:48,455
But we do want to thank
all of you for coming...

828
01:36:48,538 --> 01:36:51,374
and for sharing this wonderful day with us.

829
01:36:51,458 --> 01:36:54,252
It's bitter sweet almost, for me,

830
01:36:54,336 --> 01:36:56,548
'cause I hate giving her up.

831
01:36:56,631 --> 01:36:58,759
Anna?

832
01:37:08,604 --> 01:37:10,564
I miss you.

833
01:37:16,447 --> 01:37:19,033
I miss you too.

834
01:37:19,116 --> 01:37:21,911
Why, Malcolm?

835
01:37:21,994 --> 01:37:24,747
What?

836
01:37:26,542 --> 01:37:30,171
- What is it?
- Why did you leave me?

837
01:37:30,213 --> 01:37:33,550
I didn't leave you.

838
01:37:54,158 --> 01:37:57,956
I see people.

839
01:37:58,039 --> 01:38:00,500
They don't know they're dead.

840
01:38:04,671 --> 01:38:09,428
- How often do you see them?
- All the time.

841
01:38:12,097 --> 01:38:14,015
They're everywhere.

842
01:38:25,362 --> 01:38:27,867
They only see
what they want to see.

843
01:38:33,247 --> 01:38:36,752
Okay, Mikey.

844
01:38:36,836 --> 01:38:40,131
Come on.
Give me a minute.

845
01:39:18,178 --> 01:39:20,514
Oh, God.

846
01:39:20,597 --> 01:39:24,226
- It doesn't even hurt.
- Let me see.

847
01:39:26,813 --> 01:39:30,067
Let me see. Put your hand--

848
01:39:30,108 --> 01:39:32,361
Oh, God.

849
01:39:37,743 --> 01:39:39,828
Okay.

850
01:39:58,768 --> 01:40:02,605
I think I'm okay.
Really, I think it just went--

851
01:40:02,689 --> 01:40:05,024
went in and out.

852
01:40:08,029 --> 01:40:11,241
It doesn't even
hurt anymore.

853
01:40:40,610 --> 01:40:43,112
I think I can go now.

854
01:40:46,826 --> 01:40:49,287
I just needed
to do a couple things.

855
01:40:54,376 --> 01:40:57,048
I needed
to help someone.

856
01:40:59,592 --> 01:41:01,844
I think I did.

857
01:41:07,935 --> 01:41:10,647
And I needed
to tell you something.

858
01:41:15,443 --> 01:41:18,573
You were never second.

859
01:41:18,657 --> 01:41:21,201
Ever.

860
01:41:23,453 --> 01:41:26,123
I love you.

861
01:41:31,713 --> 01:41:33,924
You sleep now.

862
01:41:35,802 --> 01:41:38,389
Everything will be
different in the morning.

863
01:41:44,561 --> 01:41:47,483
Good night,
Malcolm.

864
01:41:52,321 --> 01:41:54,740
Good night, sweetheart.
