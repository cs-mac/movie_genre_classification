Subtitles by:Salman, Shayan & Sahar.

3
00:01:05,521 --> 00:01:09,376
I warned you.
Did I not warn you what would come of dealing with dwarves.

4
00:01:10,089 --> 00:01:12,545
Now they've done it.
They've woken the dragon.

5
00:01:12,658 --> 00:01:14,859
They've brought an apocalypse upon our heads.

6
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:20,688
Come on. Quickly!Quickly!
Faster now. I'm trying to evacuate myself here.

7
00:01:20,834 --> 00:01:23,827
Careful men.
- Never mind the books.Get on!Get in the boats.

8
00:01:23,906 --> 00:01:29,823
But Sire, should we not try to save the town.
- The town is lost, save the gold.

9
00:01:29,932 --> 00:01:32,886
Come on. Let's go.

10
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,470
Pile 'em up.

11
00:01:48,098 --> 00:01:50,685
We have no time.
We must leave.

12
00:01:50,795 --> 00:01:53,040
Get him up.
- Come on. Let's go!

13
00:01:53,191 --> 00:01:56,479
It's fine. I can walk.
- So as you can. We're not leaving.

14
00:01:56,553 --> 00:01:58,026
Not without our father.

15
00:01:58,105 --> 00:02:02,849
You stay here, your sisters will die.
Is that what your father would want?

16
00:02:04,604 --> 00:02:08,003
Open this door.
Do you hear me?

17
00:02:20,075 --> 00:02:23,056
Down here. Go!
- Give me your hand.

18
00:02:23,128 --> 00:02:25,173
Come on, we're good to go.
- Quickly now.

19
00:02:25,324 --> 00:02:27,207
Hurry!
- Kili, come on.

20
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,603
Keep on going.

21
00:02:39,153 --> 00:02:40,587
Dragon.

22
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:17,241
Come on.

23
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:19,733
Come on, Faster!

24
00:03:22,407 --> 00:03:27,678
If only we could take more people with us to bear...
...But they're hardly worth it.I agree.

25
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:29,235
Oh!Ow!

26
00:03:35,627 --> 00:03:37,428
Look out.

27
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:47,505
Move it. Move it!
Come on. Faster!

28
00:03:47,649 --> 00:03:49,666
My gold. My gold!

29
00:03:49,786 --> 00:03:52,526
We can't. It's too much weight.
We need to dump something.

30
00:03:53,235 --> 00:03:55,108
Quiet right, Alfrid.

31
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,697
Faster.

32
00:05:20,145 --> 00:05:22,481
Poor souls.

33
00:06:43,013 --> 00:06:46,078
Da. Da!

34
00:06:49,901 --> 00:06:52,828
He hit it. He hit the dragon.
- No.

35
00:06:52,887 --> 00:06:55,102
He did. He hit its mark, I saw.

36
00:06:55,217 --> 00:06:57,239
These arrows can not peirce its hide.

37
00:06:57,546 --> 00:06:59,425
I fear nothing will.

38
00:07:12,535 --> 00:07:16,797
What are you doing?
Bain?

39
00:07:19,723 --> 00:07:22,222
Leave him.
We can not go back.

40
00:07:22,331 --> 00:07:23,625
Bain.

41
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:47,786
Da.

42
00:07:48,418 --> 00:07:51,553
Bain, what are you doing?
Why didn't you leave? You were supposed to leave.

43
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,361
I'm here to help you.
- No.

44
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:56,808
No, nothing can stop him now.
- This might.

45
00:07:59,907 --> 00:08:05,138
Bain, you go back.
You get out of here now.

46
00:08:07,128 --> 00:08:08,759
Da.

47
00:08:14,757 --> 00:08:16,867
Bain.
- Da.

48
00:08:27,172 --> 00:08:29,797
Stop, stop, halt, halt!!!

49
00:08:37,752 --> 00:08:42,954
Who are you,
that would stand against me?

50
00:08:46,801 --> 00:08:50,306
Oh, that is a pity.

51
00:08:51,221 --> 00:08:57,086
What will you do now, bowman?

52
00:08:57,197 --> 00:09:03,639
You are foresaken.
No help will come.

53
00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:07,366
On my mark.
Go! Go!

54
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:09,532
Head for the open water.

55
00:09:12,132 --> 00:09:15,548
Is that your child?

56
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:21,130
You can not save him from the fire.

57
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,706
He will burn.

58
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,666
Stay still, son.

59
00:09:46,196 --> 00:09:47,321
Stay still.

60
00:09:48,229 --> 00:09:50,473
Tell me.

61
00:09:50,543 --> 00:09:56,769
Wretch, how now do you challenge me?

62
00:10:00,383 --> 00:10:04,237
You have nothing.

63
00:10:04,382 --> 00:10:08,379
But your death.

64
00:10:10,049 --> 00:10:15,400
Bain, look at me. Look at me.

65
00:10:19,873 --> 00:10:22,107
A little to your left.

66
00:10:23,551 --> 00:10:24,883
That's it.

67
00:10:40,928 --> 00:10:43,120
Bain. Hold on.

68
00:11:23,947 --> 00:11:25,322
What was that?

69
00:11:26,163 --> 00:11:28,406
What happened?
- It fell, I saw it.

70
00:11:31,549 --> 00:11:33,561
He's dead.

71
00:11:37,409 --> 00:11:39,136
Smaug is dead.

72
00:11:40,088 --> 00:11:42,822
Why my beard, I think he's right.

73
00:11:42,898 --> 00:11:45,359
Look there.

74
00:11:46,438 --> 00:11:50,722
The ravens of Erebor are returning to the mountain.

75
00:11:50,834 --> 00:11:54,223
Aye, word will spread.

76
00:11:54,338 --> 00:12:00,218
Before long, every soul in middle earth will know,
the dragon is dead.

77
00:12:10,881 --> 00:12:16,461
<B> The Battle of Five Armies </ b>

78
00:12:38,117 --> 00:12:40,395
You are not alone.

79
00:12:40,475 --> 00:12:42,095
Mithrandir.

80
00:12:42,207 --> 00:12:44,154
<i>Ilealidon</i>

81
00:12:44,265 --> 00:12:45,963
<i>Intulitun</i>

82
00:12:59,844 --> 00:13:02,443
Somebody help me.

83
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:04,176
Help.

84
00:13:07,494 --> 00:13:09,556
Help.
- I'm right Here.

85
00:13:13,743 --> 00:13:16,509
Da, Da!

86
00:13:23,164 --> 00:13:26,261
Why me?

87
00:13:34,237 --> 00:13:35,614
Tauriel.

88
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:41,089
Kili, come on.
We're leaving.

89
00:13:41,971 --> 00:13:44,195
They are your people.
You must go.

90
00:13:45,382 --> 00:13:47,152
Come with me.

91
00:13:48,354 --> 00:13:52,935
I know how I feel, I'm not afraid.
You make me feel alive.

92
00:13:53,044 --> 00:13:54,707
I can't.
- Tauriel.

93
00:13:55,273 --> 00:13:57,703
I would feel honored.

94
00:14:01,265 --> 00:14:03,711
I don't know what that means.

95
00:14:04,903 --> 00:14:07,027
I think you do.

96
00:14:13,794 --> 00:14:15,735
My lord Legolas.

97
00:14:19,017 --> 00:14:21,397
Take your leave of the dwarf.

98
00:14:23,049 --> 00:14:25,392
You are needed elsewhere.

99
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,317
Keep it.

100
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,632
As a promise.

101
00:15:22,809 --> 00:15:25,937
These are dry. You need them.
- Thank you.

102
00:15:26,013 --> 00:15:28,796
Give me one.

103
00:15:28,908 --> 00:15:30,676
I'll be caught by death in this cold.

104
00:15:30,747 --> 00:15:34,276
Find your own.
You have no charge now, Alfrid.

105
00:15:34,331 --> 00:15:35,916
That is where you are wrong.

106
00:15:36,026 --> 00:15:39,253
In the absence of the master
the power goes over to his deputy...

107
00:15:39,362 --> 00:15:42,667
which in this instance is my goodself.
Now give me that blanket.

108
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,635
Master's Deputy.
Don't make me laugh.

109
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:52,701
You're a creep, I would rather die
before I answered the likes of you.

110
00:15:52,817 --> 00:15:55,194
I think that can be arranged.

111
00:15:58,518 --> 00:16:03,230
You wouldn't go turning on your own, Alfrid.
Not now.

112
00:16:08,261 --> 00:16:10,234
Da.
- Come here.

113
00:16:10,405 --> 00:16:13,767
You're alive.
- Its fine.

114
00:16:17,723 --> 00:16:22,228
It was Bard, he killed the dragon.
I saw him with me own eyes.

115
00:16:22,302 --> 00:16:26,271
He brought the beast down.
Shot him dead with a black arrow.

116
00:16:34,068 --> 00:16:37,155
He saved us.

117
00:16:38,474 --> 00:16:42,354
All hail to the dragon slayer.

118
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,319
All hail King Bard.

119
00:16:47,462 --> 00:16:52,734
I have said many times.
This is a man of noble stock.

120
00:16:52,939 --> 00:16:55,510
A born leader.
- Do not call me that.

121
00:16:55,621 --> 00:16:58,327
I am not the master of this town.

122
00:16:59,322 --> 00:17:00,432
Where is he?

123
00:17:01,032 --> 00:17:05,468
Where's the master?
- Halfway down the lake 
- With all our coin.

124
00:17:05,547 --> 00:17:08,480
I don't doubt.
You know.

125
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:14,976
You helped him to empty the treasury.
- No, I tried to stop him.

126
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:18,730
I begged him.
- I pleaded.

127
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:24,990
I said, master, no.

128
00:17:27,621 --> 00:17:28,843
Think of the children.

129
00:17:31,177 --> 00:17:34,425
Would nobody think of the children?

130
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:47,207
Enough.

131
00:17:47,352 --> 00:17:49,624
Let him go.

132
00:17:52,621 --> 00:17:54,279
Look around you.

133
00:17:55,439 --> 00:17:58,127
Have you not had your fill of death? 

134
00:18:01,161 --> 00:18:05,496
Winter is upon us.
We must look to our own.

135
00:18:05,606 --> 00:18:08,604
To the sick and the helpless.

136
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,515
Those who can stand,
tend the wounded.

137
00:18:11,614 --> 00:18:13,915
And those who have strength left, follow me.

138
00:18:14,061 --> 00:18:16,076
We must salvage what we can.

139
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,109
And what then 
- What do we do then?

140
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,587
We find shelter.

141
00:19:08,989 --> 00:19:11,318
Hello?

142
00:19:12,256 --> 00:19:14,605
Bombur?

143
00:19:14,719 --> 00:19:16,660
Bifur?

144
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,402
Anybody?

145
00:19:25,923 --> 00:19:27,182
Wait, wait.

146
00:19:29,113 --> 00:19:30,666
It is Bilbo.
- He is alive.

147
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:32,941
Stop, stop, stop.

148
00:19:33,053 --> 00:19:38,236
We all need to leave.
- We only just got here.

149
00:19:38,281 --> 00:19:40,508
I tried talking to him,
but he won't listen.

150
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:43,142
What do you mean laddie?
- Thorin.

151
00:19:43,219 --> 00:19:45,497
Thorin, Thorin
- He's been down there for days.

152
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:50,234
He barely eats.
He's not been himself at all.

153
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,086
It's this place.
I think a sickness lies on him.

154
00:19:54,205 --> 00:19:58,141
Sickness? What kind of sickness?

155
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,989
Fili.

156
00:20:34,354 --> 00:20:36,053
Gold.

157
00:20:37,244 --> 00:20:40,305
Gold beyond measure.

158
00:20:41,331 --> 00:20:46,736
Beyond sorrow and grief.

159
00:20:53,163 --> 00:20:59,582
Behold, the great treasure hoard of Thror.

160
00:21:07,274 --> 00:21:11,560
Welcome, my sister's sons.

161
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:19,986
To the kingdom of Erebor.

162
00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:24,539
Balin.

163
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,667
Any sign of it?
- Nothing yet.

164
00:21:40,745 --> 00:21:42,923
Nothing here.
- Keep searching.

165
00:21:42,999 --> 00:21:44,694
That jewel could be anywhere.

166
00:21:44,778 --> 00:21:48,091
The Arkenstone is in these halls.
Find it.

167
00:21:48,715 --> 00:21:50,698
Keep looking.
- All of you.

168
00:21:51,902 --> 00:21:54,066
No one rests until it is found.

169
00:22:24,997 --> 00:22:29,350
<i>I am almost tempted to let you take it</i>

170
00:22:30,337 --> 00:22:34,391
<i>If only to see Oakenshield suffer</i>

171
00:22:35,556 --> 00:22:38,364
<i>Watch it destroy him </i>.

172
00:22:38,481 --> 00:22:42,151
<i>Watch it corrupt his heart</i>

173
00:22:42,268 --> 00:22:45,216
<i>And drive him mad</i>

174
00:23:18,736 --> 00:23:20,371
Take only what you need.

175
00:23:20,814 --> 00:23:24,194
We have a long march ahead.
- Where will you go?

176
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:28,373
There is only one place.

177
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:33,385
The Mountain.

178
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:38,709
You are a genius, Sire.
We can seek refuge inside the mountain.

179
00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:42,260
It must smell a bit of dragon.
Women can clean that up.

180
00:23:42,372 --> 00:23:43,814
It'll be safe, warm and dry.

181
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:48,285
Full of stores.
Bedding and clothing.

182
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:50,695
And a bit of gold.

183
00:23:52,657 --> 00:23:55,105
What gold is in that mountain is cursed.

184
00:23:55,251 --> 00:23:59,706
We will take only what was promised to us.
Only what we need to rebuild our lives .

185
00:24:00,724 --> 00:24:03,465
Here, pull your weight.

186
00:24:03,576 --> 00:24:07,396
News of the death of Smaug
will spread through the lands.

187
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:09,205
Aye.

188
00:24:11,015 --> 00:24:14,109
Others will now look to the mountain.

189
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:19,255
For its wealth
- For its position.

190
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:23,133
What is it you know?
- Nothing for certain.

191
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:26,595
It's what I fear may come.

192
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,491
Woodland Elves.

193
00:24:43,447 --> 00:24:48,696
The king's son and the she-elf,
They tracked us to Lake-town.

194
00:24:54,496 --> 00:24:57,166
And you killed them?

195
00:24:57,461 --> 00:25:00,859
They fled and squealing like cowards.

196
00:25:00,906 --> 00:25:07,049
You fool! They will return
with an army of elves at their backs!

197
00:25:09,408 --> 00:25:12,557
Ride to Gundabad.

198
00:25:13,603 --> 00:25:17,067
Let the Legions come forth.

199
00:25:21,797 --> 00:25:23,172
Elves.

200
00:25:23,767 --> 00:25:25,374
Men.

201
00:25:25,466 --> 00:25:27,079
Dwarves.

202
00:25:27,204 --> 00:25:32,548
The mountain will be their tomb.
To war.

203
00:25:36,552 --> 00:25:38,324
You saw something out there?

204
00:25:38,431 --> 00:25:41,342
The Orc I persued near Lake town,
I know who he is.

205
00:25:41,451 --> 00:25:44,629
Bolg, spawn of Azog the Defiler.

206
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:49,673
A warg pack was waiting for him in the outskirts of Esgaroth.
They fled into the north.

207
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:54,435
These Orcs were different from the others.
They wore a mark that I have not seen for a long time.

208
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:57,833
The mark of Gundabad.
- Gundabad?

209
00:25:57,947 --> 00:26:01,191
An Orc stronghold in the far north
of the Misty Mountains.

210
00:26:01,304 --> 00:26:05,132
My lord Legolas.
I bring word from your father.

211
00:26:05,316 --> 00:26:07,225
You are to return to him immediately.

212
00:26:07,335 --> 00:26:09,253
Come, Tauriel.

213
00:26:09,362 --> 00:26:13,927
My lord, Tauriel is banished.

214
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,283
Banished?

215
00:26:16,962 --> 00:26:22,408
You may tell my father, 
if there is no place for Tauriel,
there is no place for me.

216
00:26:23,635 --> 00:26:24,917
Legolas.

217
00:26:25,028 --> 00:26:30,115
This is your King's command.
- Yes, he is my king...

218
00:26:30,895 --> 00:26:32,808
but he does not command my heart.

219
00:26:33,621 --> 00:26:35,456
I ride north.
Will you come with me?

220
00:26:35,572 --> 00:26:38,478
To where?
- To Gundabad.

221
00:27:29,385 --> 00:27:32,512
Spells will not save you, old man.

222
00:27:57,422 --> 00:28:00,737
This is my master's domain...

223
00:28:00,853 --> 00:28:02,808
Die now, Wizard.

224
00:28:21,006 --> 00:28:27,473
Three rings for the elven-kings
under the sky.

225
00:28:28,589 --> 00:28:34,248
Seven for the dwarf-lords in their halls of stone
.

226
00:28:34,249 --> 00:28:39,711
Nine for mortal men who are doomed to die.

227
00:29:03,176 --> 00:29:05,871
You can not fight the shadow.

228
00:29:06,143 --> 00:29:08,839
Even now you fade.

229
00:29:10,138 --> 00:29:14,090
One light alone in the darkness.

230
00:29:14,862 --> 00:29:17,885
I am not alone.

231
00:29:28,489 --> 00:29:32,084
Are you in need of assistance, my Lady?

232
00:29:35,935 --> 00:29:39,465
You should have stayed dead.

233
00:30:05,957 --> 00:30:08,020
Mithrandir.

234
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:11,740
Come back.

235
00:30:26,987 --> 00:30:29,867
He is here.

236
00:30:30,014 --> 00:30:34,158
Yes, the darkness has returned.

237
00:30:45,371 --> 00:30:48,024
Gandalf, climb on.

238
00:30:48,136 --> 00:30:53,621
He is weak, he can not remain here.
It is draining his life.

239
00:30:54,058 --> 00:30:55,866
Go, quickly.

240
00:30:58,344 --> 00:31:01,222
Come with me, my Lady.

241
00:31:09,709 --> 00:31:11,405
Go.

242
00:31:49,305 --> 00:31:52,071
It has begun.

243
00:31:52,291 --> 00:31:54,696
The East will fall.

244
00:31:54,805 --> 00:31:59,741
So shall the kingdom of Angmar rise.

245
00:32:00,408 --> 00:32:04,825
The time of the elves is over.

246
00:32:04,945 --> 00:32:07,730
The Age of the Orc has come.

247
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:21,489
You have no power here.

248
00:32:21,635 --> 00:32:24,568
Servant of Mordor.

249
00:32:25,447 --> 00:32:30,385
You are nameless.

250
00:32:31,486 --> 00:32:33,169
Faceless.

251
00:32:34,715 --> 00:32:37,234
Shapeless.

252
00:32:40,567 --> 00:32:44,191
Go back to the void.

253
00:32:44,321 --> 00:32:48,581
From whence you came.

254
00:33:05,562 --> 00:33:08,173
We were deceived.

255
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:12,962
The spirit of Sauron endured.

256
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:15,573
And has been banished.

257
00:33:15,685 --> 00:33:18,245
He will flee into the east.

258
00:33:20,261 --> 00:33:22,156
Gondor should be warned.

259
00:33:22,495 --> 00:33:25,153
Set a watch on the walls of Mordor.

260
00:33:25,554 --> 00:33:30,548
No, look after the Lady Galadriel.
She has spent much of her power.

261
00:33:30,889 --> 00:33:32,804
Her strength is fading.

262
00:33:32,915 --> 00:33:34,688
Take her to Lothlórien.

263
00:33:34,802 --> 00:33:40,005
My lord Saruman,
he must be hunted down and destroyed once and for all.

264
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:42,133
Without the ring of power.

265
00:33:42,247 --> 00:33:46,418
Sauron can never hold dominion over Middle-earth.

266
00:33:47,638 --> 00:33:53,623
Go now and leave Sauron to me.

267
00:34:03,132 --> 00:34:04,830
I need a horse.
- What?

268
00:34:06,361 --> 00:34:07,835
Gandalf, where are you going?

269
00:34:07,883 --> 00:34:11,354
To warn Erebor,
they've no idea of what is coming.

270
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:15,815
I saw them with my own eyes.
Rank upon rank of Moria orcs.

271
00:34:15,924 --> 00:34:18,793
You must summon our friends,
bird and beast...

272
00:34:18,911 --> 00:34:21,655
the battle for the mountain is about to begin.

273
00:34:24,394 --> 00:34:29,061
It is here in these halls, I know it.
- We have searched and searched.

274
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:33,790
Not well enough.
- Thorin, we all want to see the stone returned.

275
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,173
And yet it's still not found.

276
00:34:39,545 --> 00:34:43,587
Do you doubt the loyalty of anyone here?

277
00:34:51,786 --> 00:34:57,069
The Arkenstone is the birthright of our people.

278
00:34:57,224 --> 00:35:00,925
It is the King's jewel.

279
00:35:02,081 --> 00:35:03,667
Am I not the king?

280
00:35:14,693 --> 00:35:16,116
Know this.

281
00:35:19,512 --> 00:35:25,165
If anyone should find it
and withold it from me...

282
00:35:26,277 --> 00:35:29,414
I will be avenged.

283
00:35:43,938 --> 00:35:46,087
Dragon sickness.

284
00:35:46,956 --> 00:35:48,572
I've seen it before.

285
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:54,726
That look, the terrible need...

286
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:59,210
is a fierce and jealous love, Bilbo.

287
00:36:01,673 --> 00:36:03,867
It sent his grandfather mad.

288
00:36:04,557 --> 00:36:10,291
Thorin,
- if Thorin had the Arkenstone.

289
00:36:11,406 --> 00:36:13,569
What if it is found.

290
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:17,360
Would it help?

291
00:36:19,536 --> 00:36:23,865
That stone crowns all.

292
00:36:24,948 --> 00:36:27,760
It is the summit of this great wealth.

293
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:31,072
The stone,
- bestowing power upon he who held...

294
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:33,293
But withstay his madness

295
00:36:34,231 --> 00:36:36,465
No, laddie.

296
00:36:38,343 --> 00:36:40,573
I fear that would make it worse.

297
00:36:42,745 --> 00:36:47,527
Perhaps it is best,
if it remains lost.

298
00:37:01,144 --> 00:37:02,478
What is that?

299
00:37:03,957 --> 00:37:06,558
In your hand?
- It's... It's nothing.

300
00:37:06,855 --> 00:37:08,183
Show me.

301
00:37:09,777 --> 00:37:11,028
It...

302
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,554
I picked it up in Beorn's garden.

303
00:37:24,767 --> 00:37:26,493
You've carried it all this way.

304
00:37:27,002 --> 00:37:30,248
I'm going to plant it in my garden.
In Bag-end.

305
00:37:32,555 --> 00:37:36,513
Its a poor price to take back to the Shire.

306
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:43,154
One day it'll grow
and every time I look at it I'll remember.

307
00:37:44,224 --> 00:37:50,564
I'll remember everything that happened, the good, the bad
and how lucky I am that I made it home.

308
00:37:59,836 --> 00:38:00,992
Thorin.

309
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:08,053
Thorin, survivors, from Lake-town.
They're streaming into Dale.

310
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:10,792
There's hundreds of them .

311
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:14,585
Call everyone to the gate.

312
00:38:15,744 --> 00:38:18,227
To the gate, now.

313
00:38:49,258 --> 00:38:51,208
Come on, keep moving.

314
00:38:51,278 --> 00:38:56,534
Sire, Sire, up here.

315
00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:08,070
Look Sire, the braziers(torches) are lit.

316
00:39:08,181 --> 00:39:13,111
So, the company of Thorin Oakenshield survived.

317
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,667
Survived?

318
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:18,209
You mean there's a bunch of dwarves in there
with all that gold?

319
00:39:19,046 --> 00:39:23,684
you shouldn't worry, Alfrid.
- There's gold enough in that mountain for all.

320
00:39:23,797 --> 00:39:25,680
Make camp here tonight.

321
00:39:25,801 --> 00:39:29,347
Find what shelter you can.
Get some fires going.

322
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:34,135
Alfrid, you take the night watch.

323
00:39:51,942 --> 00:39:55,072
This fortress must be safe by sunrise.

324
00:39:55,961 --> 00:39:59,555
This mountain was ours once,
I will not see it be taken again.

325
00:39:59,662 --> 00:40:02,503
The people of Lake-town have nothing.

326
00:40:02,616 --> 00:40:06,393
They came to us in need.
They have lost everything.

327
00:40:06,502 --> 00:40:09,856
Do not tell me what they have lost.

328
00:40:09,927 --> 00:40:13,387
I know well enough their hardships.

329
00:40:14,729 --> 00:40:17,934
Those who have less than dragon fire,
should rejoice.

330
00:40:19,095 --> 00:40:22,013
They have much to be grateful for.

331
00:40:26,111 --> 00:40:28,847
More stone.

332
00:40:31,267 --> 00:40:32,953
More stone to the gate.

333
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:57,489
These children are starving.
We need food.

334
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:59,638
We won't last three days.

335
00:40:59,713 --> 00:41:02,956
Bard, we don't have enough.
- Do what you can, Percy.

336
00:41:05,392 --> 00:41:07,431
We need more water.

337
00:41:08,185 --> 00:41:11,030
The children, the wounded and women come first.

338
00:41:11,138 --> 00:41:12,292
Yeah.

339
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,465
Morning, Alfrid.

340
00:41:15,033 --> 00:41:16,532
What news from the night watch?

341
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:19,596
 A little quiet Sire,
nothing to report.

342
00:41:19,706 --> 00:41:21,454
Nothing gets past me.

343
00:41:28,555 --> 00:41:32,067
Except an army of elves
That would seem.

344
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:06,490
My lord Thranduil.

345
00:42:06,597 --> 00:42:10,076
We did not look to see you here.
- I heard you needed aid.

346
00:42:32,033 --> 00:42:33,550
Here.

347
00:42:38,678 --> 00:42:40,152
You have saved us.

348
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:44,366
I do not know how to thank you.
- Your gratitude is misplaced.

349
00:42:44,477 --> 00:42:49,650
I did not come on your behalf.
I came to reclaim something of mine.

350
00:42:56,471 --> 00:43:00,691
<i>There are gems in the mountain that I too desire.</i>

351
00:43:00,799 --> 00:43:04,542
<i>White gems,
of pure starlight</i>

352
00:43:04,617 --> 00:43:07,500
White gems of Esgaroth.

353
00:43:09,454 --> 00:43:13,410
I know an Elf lord who would pay
 a pretty price for these.

354
00:43:17,806 --> 00:43:19,215
Wait.

355
00:43:19,364 --> 00:43:20,730
Please wait.

356
00:43:23,105 --> 00:43:25,916
You would go to war for a handful of gems?

357
00:43:25,932 --> 00:43:29,767
The heirlooms of my people are not likely foresaken.

358
00:43:29,955 --> 00:43:31,686
We are allies in this.

359
00:43:32,763 --> 00:43:36,407
My people also have a claim upn the riches in that mountain.

360
00:43:37,376 --> 00:43:39,070
Let me speak with Thorin.

361
00:43:40,435 --> 00:43:45,744
You would try to reason with a dwarf?
- To avoid war, yes.

362
00:43:46,793 --> 00:43:48,236
Nice work.

363
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:51,945
Come on.

364
00:44:14,479 --> 00:44:17,325
Hail Thorin, son of Thrain.

365
00:44:17,438 --> 00:44:20,175
We are glad to find you alive beyond hope.

366
00:44:20,287 --> 00:44:24,433
Why do you come to the gates of 
king under the mountain armed for war?

367
00:44:24,547 --> 00:44:28,213
Why does the king under the mountain
fence himself in?

368
00:44:28,325 --> 00:44:30,309
Like a robber in his hole.

369
00:44:30,956 --> 00:44:34,403
Perhaps it is because I am 
expecting to be robbed.

370
00:44:34,869 --> 00:44:36,716
My lord.

371
00:44:36,822 --> 00:44:41,867
We have not come to rob you.
But to seek fair settlement.

372
00:44:41,975 --> 00:44:44,103
Will you not speak with me?

373
00:45:18,487 --> 00:45:20,626
I 'm listening.

374
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:26,352
On behalf of the people of Lake-town,
I ask that you honour your pledge.

375
00:45:26,461 --> 00:45:30,205
A share of the treasure,
so they might rebuild their lives.

376
00:45:30,313 --> 00:45:36,232
I will not treat with any man,
While an armed host lies before my door.

377
00:45:36,437 --> 00:45:40,498
That armed host will attack this mountain,
if we do not come to terms.

378
00:45:41,043 --> 00:45:43,924
Your threats do not sway me.

379
00:45:45,438 --> 00:45:47,738
What of your conscience?

380
00:45:47,851 --> 00:45:50,730
Does it not tell you our cause is just?

381
00:45:51,966 --> 00:45:55,310
My people offered you help.

382
00:45:56,201 --> 00:46:00,242
And in return you brought upon them only ruin and death.

383
00:46:00,343 --> 00:46:04,300
When did the men of Lake-town come to our aid
before the promise of rich reward?

384
00:46:04,379 --> 00:46:06,729
A bargain was struck.
- A bargain?

385
00:46:06,838 --> 00:46:11,211
What choice do we have but to barter our birthright
for blankets and food?

386
00:46:11,299 --> 00:46:14,393
To ransom our future
in exchange for our freedom.

387
00:46:15,476 --> 00:46:17,761
You call that a fair trade?

388
00:46:19,721 --> 00:46:23,615
Tell me, Bard the dragon slayer.

389
00:46:24,775 --> 00:46:27,426
Why should I honor such terms?

390
00:46:28,898 --> 00:46:31,853
Because you gave us your word.

391
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,720
Does that mean nothing?

392
00:46:52,034 --> 00:46:56,372
Be gone, let the arrows fly.

393
00:47:14,356 --> 00:47:15,898
What are you doing?

394
00:47:17,349 --> 00:47:20,377
You can not go to war.

395
00:47:21,323 --> 00:47:22,893
This does not concern you.

396
00:47:23,001 --> 00:47:27,685
Excuse me, but in case you haven't noticed
there is an army of elves out there.

397
00:47:27,757 --> 00:47:30,245
Not to mention several hundred angry fishermen.

398
00:47:30,874 --> 00:47:33,039
We are in fact outnumbered.

399
00:47:34,943 --> 00:47:36,992
Not for much longer.

400
00:47:38,095 --> 00:47:39,927
What does that mean?

401
00:47:39,928 --> 00:47:41,529
That means, master Baggins...

402
00:47:44,322 --> 00:47:47,108
You should never underestimate dwarves.

403
00:47:50,364 --> 00:47:52,556
We have reclaimed Erebor.

404
00:47:53,609 --> 00:47:56,415
Now we defend it.

405
00:48:14,085 --> 00:48:16,099
He will give us nothing.

406
00:48:17,217 --> 00:48:21,100
Such a pity.
But still, you tried.

407
00:48:21,212 --> 00:48:22,615
I do not understand.

408
00:48:23,701 --> 00:48:27,334
Why, why would he risk war?

409
00:48:40,394 --> 00:48:42,537
It is fruitless to reason with them.

410
00:48:42,658 --> 00:48:45,649
They understand only one thing.

411
00:48:49,399 --> 00:48:51,306
We attack at dawn.

412
00:48:53,916 --> 00:48:55,385
Support us you?

413
00:49:32,035 --> 00:49:34,681
Master Baggins, come here.

414
00:49:51,472 --> 00:49:53,420
You are going need this.

415
00:49:54,217 --> 00:49:56,126
Put it on.

416
00:50:01,384 --> 00:50:04,310
This vest is made of silver steel.

417
00:50:05,605 --> 00:50:07,780
Mithril.

418
00:50:08,322 --> 00:50:10,585
It was called by my forebearers.

419
00:50:12,543 --> 00:50:15,497
No blade can pierce it.

420
00:50:26,486 --> 00:50:29,669
I look absurd.
I'm not a warrior, I'm a hobbit.

421
00:50:29,787 --> 00:50:31,731
It is a gift.

422
00:50:33,138 --> 00:50:35,370
A token of our friendship.

423
00:50:38,426 --> 00:50:40,381
True friends are hard to come by.

424
00:50:42,491 --> 00:50:45,900
I have been blind.
But now I am able to see.

425
00:50:46,909 --> 00:50:51,492
I am betrayed.
- Betrayed?

426
00:50:52,024 --> 00:50:53,735
The Arkenstone.

427
00:51:02,704 --> 00:51:05,186
One of them has taken it.

428
00:51:12,077 --> 00:51:15,356
One of them is false.

429
00:51:15,945 --> 00:51:17,374
Thorin.

430
00:51:18,139 --> 00:51:23,008
The quest is fulfilled.
You've won the mountain. Is that not enough?

431
00:51:23,123 --> 00:51:25,751
Betrayed by my own kin.

432
00:51:26,546 --> 00:51:29,942
No, you made a promise to the people of Lake-town.

433
00:51:30,081 --> 00:51:34,058
Is this treasure truly worth more than your honor?

434
00:51:34,173 --> 00:51:37,555
Our honor. Thorin, I was also there,
I gave my word.

435
00:51:37,673 --> 00:51:39,468
For that I am grateful.

436
00:51:39,545 --> 00:51:44,990
It was nobly done. But the treasure of the mountain
does not belong to the people of Lake-town.

437
00:51:45,132 --> 00:51:46,933
This gold...

438
00:51:50,062 --> 00:51:52,548
is ours.

439
00:51:53,501 --> 00:51:56,056
And ours alone.

440
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:05,023
All my life,
I will not...

441
00:52:05,024 --> 00:52:08,913
...part with a single coin.

442
00:52:10,715 --> 00:52:16,982
Not one piece of it.

443
00:52:38,182 --> 00:52:39,944
Gundabad.

444
00:52:42,902 --> 00:52:46,471
What lies beyond?
- An old enemy.

445
00:52:46,581 --> 00:52:49,608
The ancient kingdom of Angmar.

446
00:52:52,166 --> 00:52:57,817
This fortress was once its stronghold.
It is where they kept their great armouries.

447
00:52:57,925 --> 00:53:00,267
Forged their weapons of war.

448
00:53:01,758 --> 00:53:03,626
Light, I saw movement.

449
00:53:05,685 --> 00:53:08,371
We wait for the cover of night.

450
00:53:09,412 --> 00:53:11,413
It is a fell place, Tauriel.

451
00:53:11,559 --> 00:53:15,748
In another age,
our people waged war on those lands.

452
00:53:26,066 --> 00:53:27,663
My mother died there.

453
00:53:28,964 --> 00:53:31,482
My father does not speak of it.

454
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,983
There is no grave.

455
00:53:35,955 --> 00:53:37,990
No memory.

456
00:53:40,464 --> 00:53:42,169
Nothing.

457
00:53:49,011 --> 00:53:51,379
Let me through.

458
00:53:52,336 --> 00:53:53,722
Make way.

459
00:54:11,088 --> 00:54:13,237
No, no, oye, You.

460
00:54:13,395 --> 00:54:14,836
Pointy hat.

461
00:54:15,817 --> 00:54:17,542
Yes, you.

462
00:54:17,692 --> 00:54:21,596
We don't want no drunks, beggars, no vagabonds
around here.

463
00:54:21,742 --> 00:54:24,011
We've got enough trouble without the likes of you.

464
00:54:25,481 --> 00:54:29,765
Off you go. On your ****
- Who's incharge here?

465
00:54:29,881 --> 00:54:31,721
Who's asking?

466
00:54:35,437 --> 00:54:38,898
You must set aside your petty grievances
with the dwarves.

467
00:54:38,969 --> 00:54:43,327
War is coming.
The segments of Dol Guldur have been emptied.

468
00:54:43,978 --> 00:54:46,644
You're all in mortal danger.

469
00:54:46,753 --> 00:54:48,383
What are you talking about?

470
00:54:48,498 --> 00:54:50,796
I can see you know nothing of wizards.

471
00:54:51,238 --> 00:54:54,931
They are like winter thunder on a wild wind
rolling in from a distance

472
00:54:55,011 --> 00:54:58,545
breaking hard in a long...

473
00:54:58,773 --> 00:55:03,740
But sometimes, a storm is just a storm.

474
00:55:03,847 --> 00:55:07,868
Not this time.
Armies of orcs are on the move.

475
00:55:08,011 --> 00:55:13,201
These are fighters, they have been bred for war.
Our enemy has summoned his full strength.

476
00:55:13,275 --> 00:55:16,462
Why show his hand now?
- Because we forced him.

477
00:55:16,611 --> 00:55:21,359
We forced him when the company of
Thorin Oakenshield set out to reclaim their homeland.

478
00:55:21,477 --> 00:55:24,232
The dwarves were never meant to reach Erebor.

479
00:55:24,355 --> 00:55:27,457
Azog the Defiler was sent to kill them.

480
00:55:27,566 --> 00:55:31,170
His master seeks control of the mountain.

481
00:55:31,248 --> 00:55:37,005
Not just for the treasure within.
But for where it lies,
 its strategic position.

482
00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:42,442
This is the gateway to reclaiming the lands of Angmar
in the north.

483
00:55:42,553 --> 00:55:45,531
If that fell kingdom should rise again...

484
00:55:46,436 --> 00:55:52,299
Rivendell, Lorien, The Shire,
even Gondor itself will fall.

485
00:55:52,450 --> 00:55:56,072
These orc armies you speak of, Mithrandir.

486
00:55:56,218 --> 00:55:58,240
Where are they?

487
00:56:02,245 --> 00:56:05,889
Our army will be in position by dawn.

488
00:56:06,274 --> 00:56:08,928
The attack will be sudden and swift.

489
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,072
The fools.

490
00:56:11,216 --> 00:56:15,436
They have forgotten what lives beneath these lands.

491
00:56:17,679 --> 00:56:22,289
They have forgotten the great Earth-eaters.

492
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:36,229
If we are going in
-we should move now.

493
00:56:47,439 --> 00:56:49,600
They are swarming.

494
00:56:51,636 --> 00:56:55,065
These bats are bred for one  purpose.
- For what?

495
00:56:57,334 --> 00:56:58,897
For war.

496
00:57:40,149 --> 00:57:45,040
We must warn the others.
- We may be too late. Hurry!

497
00:57:59,613 --> 00:58:04,735
Since when has my counsel counted for so little?
What do you think I am trying to do?

498
00:58:04,745 --> 00:58:09,831
I think you're trying to save your Dwarvish friends.
And I admire your loyalty to them.

499
00:58:09,841 --> 00:58:13,057
But it does not disuade me from my course.

500
00:58:13,825 --> 00:58:20,031
You started this, Mithrandir.
You will forgive me if I finish it.

501
00:58:20,253 --> 00:58:23,344
Are the archers in position?
- Yes, my lord.

502
00:58:23,779 --> 00:58:29,038
Give the order.
If anything moves on that mountain, kill it.

503
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:34,316
The dwarves are out of time.

504
00:59:01,181 --> 00:59:07,503
You, Bowman, did you agree with this?
Is gold so important to you?

505
00:59:07,843 --> 00:59:10,238
Would you buy it with the blood of dwarves?

506
00:59:10,697 --> 00:59:15,292
It will not come to that. This is a fight they can not win.
- That won't stop them.

507
00:59:15,701 --> 00:59:20,507
You think, the dwarves will surrender...
They won't, they will fight to the death to defend their own.

508
00:59:20,715 --> 00:59:22,733
Bilbo Baggins.

509
00:59:23,239 --> 00:59:24,705
If I'm not mistaken...

510
00:59:24,715 --> 00:59:30,162
This is the halfling who stole the keys
to my dungeons from under the noses of my guards.

511
00:59:32,922 --> 00:59:36,740
Yes. Sorry about that.

512
00:59:38,489 --> 00:59:42,361
I came... to give you this.

513
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:49,610
The heart of the mountain.

514
00:59:50,810 --> 00:59:52,408
The king's jewel.

515
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:56,124
And worth a King's ransom.

516
00:59:58,587 --> 01:00:02,743
How is this yours to give?
- I took it as my 14th share of the treasure.

517
01:00:04,115 --> 01:00:08,584
Why would you do this? Where is your loyalty?
- I'm not doing it for you.

518
01:00:10,105 --> 01:00:12,594
I know that dwarves can be obstinate...

519
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:18,419
And ***headed and difficult
suspicious and secretive...

520
01:00:18,593 --> 01:00:23,822
with the worst manners you can possibly imagine.
But they are also brave and kind...

521
01:00:25,782 --> 01:00:27,079
and loyal to a fault.

522
01:00:28,552 --> 01:00:31,546
I have grown very fond of them
and I would save them if I can.

523
01:00:32,744 --> 01:00:35,865
But Thorin values this stone
above all else.

524
01:00:36,618 --> 01:00:40,452
In exchange for its return,
I believe he will give you what you are owed.

525
01:00:40,501 --> 01:00:42,564
There will be no need for war.

526
01:00:48,772 --> 01:00:51,497
Rest up tonight.
You must leave on the morrow.

527
01:00:52,006 --> 01:00:54,926
Get as far away from here as possible.
- I'm not leaving.

528
01:00:55,372 --> 01:00:58,622
You picked me as the 14th man.
I am not about to leave the company now.

529
01:00:58,632 --> 01:01:00,856
There is no company. Not any more.

530
01:01:00,930 --> 01:01:03,341
I don't like to think what Thorin would do,
if he finds out what you have done.

531
01:01:03,351 --> 01:01:06,906
I'm not afraid of Thorin.
- But you should be.

532
01:01:07,609 --> 01:01:10,451
Don't underestimate the evil of gold.

533
01:01:10,941 --> 01:01:14,116
Gold of which a serpent has long brooded.

534
01:01:14,126 --> 01:01:17,812
Dragon sickness
seeps into the hearts of all who come to this mountain.

535
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:21,785
Almost all.

536
01:01:24,064 --> 01:01:30,057
You there, find this hobbit a bed.
And fill his bed with hot food.

537
01:01:31,570 --> 01:01:33,023
He's earned it.

538
01:01:36,474 --> 01:01:41,745
Keep an eye on him.
If he should try to leave, you tell me.

539
01:01:44,459 --> 01:01:45,917
Move it.

540
01:02:20,985 --> 01:02:24,448
Wakey Wakey, Hobbit up you...get.

541
01:02:45,925 --> 01:02:48,364
I will put the next one 
in between your eyes.

542
01:03:12,612 --> 01:03:14,433
We have come to tell you...

543
01:03:14,561 --> 01:03:19,620
Payment of your debt
has been offered and accepted.

544
01:03:21,368 --> 01:03:27,097
What payment? I gave you nothing.
- You have nothing.

545
01:03:33,933 --> 01:03:35,590
We have this.

546
01:03:39,512 --> 01:03:41,108
They have the Arkenstone.

547
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:47,176
Thieves. How can you buy the heirloom of our house?

548
01:03:47,564 --> 01:03:49,831
That stone belongs to the king.

549
01:03:50,332 --> 01:03:52,255
The king may have it.

550
01:03:52,717 --> 01:03:54,231
With our goodwill...

551
01:03:58,936 --> 01:04:03,163
But first, he must honor his word.

552
01:04:05,483 --> 01:04:10,766
They are taking us for fools. It is a ruse.

553
01:04:12,054 --> 01:04:13,755
A filthy lie.

554
01:04:15,205 --> 01:04:19,259
The Arkenstone is in this mountain.
It is a trick.

555
01:04:19,269 --> 01:04:23,515
Its no trick. The stone is real.

556
01:04:25,473 --> 01:04:26,741
I gave it to them.

557
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:36,601
You...

558
01:04:38,549 --> 01:04:40,559
I took it as my 14th share.

559
01:04:42,526 --> 01:04:44,371
You'd steal from me.

560
01:04:44,451 --> 01:04:49,046
Steal from you? No. I may be a burglar, but
I'd like to think I'm an honest one.

561
01:04:52,043 --> 01:04:54,603
I am willing to let it stand against my claim.

562
01:04:54,613 --> 01:04:56,708
Against your claim?

563
01:04:58,340 --> 01:05:00,159
Your claim.

564
01:05:00,833 --> 01:05:04,727
You have no claim over me,
you miserable ***.

565
01:05:06,454 --> 01:05:08,143
I was going to give it to you.

566
01:05:09,257 --> 01:05:13,769
Many times I wanted to but,
- But what thief?

567
01:05:13,818 --> 01:05:16,299
You are changed, Thorin.

568
01:05:16,503 --> 01:05:20,655
The dwarf I met in Bag-end would
never have gone back on his word...

569
01:05:21,591 --> 01:05:24,079
would never have doubted the loyalty of his kin.

570
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:29,206
Do not speak to me of loyalty...

571
01:05:32,683 --> 01:05:34,619
Throw him from the rampart.

572
01:05:42,882 --> 01:05:44,290
Did you not hear me?

573
01:05:47,419 --> 01:05:50,274
I will do it myself.
I curse you.

574
01:05:51,256 --> 01:05:53,937
Cursed be the wizard who put you in this company.

575
01:05:53,947 --> 01:06:00,241
You give back my burglar, but please don't damage him.
Return him to me.

576
01:06:04,389 --> 01:06:10,647
You're not making a very splendid figure
as king under the mountain, are you ...

577
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:13,832
Thorin, son of Thrain.

578
01:06:20,216 --> 01:06:23,075
Never again will I have dealings with wizards...

579
01:06:23,471 --> 01:06:25,639
Go.
- ... Or Shire ****.

580
01:06:30,165 --> 01:06:36,037
Are we resolved?
The return of the Arkenstone for what was promised.

581
01:06:42,347 --> 01:06:43,956
Give us your answer.

582
01:06:45,296 --> 01:06:50,053
Will you have peace or war?

583
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,641
I will have war.

584
01:07:16,617 --> 01:07:18,331
Iron Front.

585
01:07:24,609 --> 01:07:26,325
Stand by.

586
01:07:45,215 --> 01:07:48,207
Who is that? He doesn't look very happy.

587
01:07:48,236 --> 01:07:53,110
This is Dain, Lord of the Iron Hills.
Thorin's cousin.

588
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:58,847
Are they alike?
- I've always found Thorin the more reasonable of the two.

589
01:08:09,128 --> 01:08:12,282
Good morning. How are we all?

590
01:08:15,625 --> 01:08:20,855
I have a wee proposition,if you wouldn't mind
 giving me a few moments of your time?

591
01:08:22,384 --> 01:08:24,496
Would you consider...

592
01:08:25,535 --> 01:08:27,753
Just starting off?

593
01:08:28,926 --> 01:08:32,761
All of you, right now.
- Stand fast.

594
01:08:34,092 --> 01:08:38,770
Come now, lord Dain.
- Gandalf the Grey.

595
01:08:40,553 --> 01:08:45,866
Tell this rabble to leave,
 or I'll water the ground with their blood.

596
01:08:48,510 --> 01:08:52,847
There is no need for war between
dwarves, men and elves.

597
01:08:53,124 --> 01:08:57,349
A legion of Orcs march on the mountain.
Stand your army down.

598
01:08:57,359 --> 01:09:00,745
I will not stand down before any elf.

599
01:09:01,031 --> 01:09:04,456
Not least this faithless woodland *****.

600
01:09:05,057 --> 01:09:08,093
He wishes nothing but ill upon my people.

601
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:12,917
If he chooses to stand between me and my kin...

602
01:09:13,587 --> 01:09:18,986
I'll split his pretty head open.
See if he's still smirking ****.

603
01:09:20,940 --> 01:09:25,173
He's clearly mad, like his cousin.
- You hear that lads?

604
01:09:25,811 --> 01:09:30,031
Come on.
Let's give these ******** a good hammering.

605
01:09:30,119 --> 01:09:32,777
Come on, children of Durin.

606
01:09:39,079 --> 01:09:41,569
Prepare.
- Ready.

607
01:09:49,628 --> 01:09:51,396
Were-Worms.

608
01:10:00,219 --> 01:10:02,567
Oh! Come on.

609
01:10:15,142 --> 01:10:20,341
Come forth my armies!

610
01:10:29,905 --> 01:10:32,734
The hordes of hell are upon us.

611
01:10:33,139 --> 01:10:36,809
Fight, Sons of Durin.

612
01:10:41,933 --> 01:10:44,367
I'm going over the wall. Who's coming with me?

613
01:10:45,457 --> 01:10:47,541
Come on.
- Stand down.

614
01:10:48,447 --> 01:10:52,516
Are we to do nothing?
- I said, "Stand down."

615
01:10:56,751 --> 01:10:59,546
The Elves, 
will they not fight?

616
01:11:02,756 --> 01:11:05,548
Thranduil, this is madness.

617
01:11:21,794 --> 01:11:23,868
Ready!

618
01:11:54,295 --> 01:11:55,703
Charge.

619
01:11:57,366 --> 01:11:59,180
Hit me and you're dead.

620
01:12:00,705 --> 01:12:03,869
Gandalf, is this a good place to stand?

621
01:12:03,879 --> 01:12:06,651
Send in the war beasts .

622
01:12:17,766 --> 01:12:19,680
Ready to attack.

623
01:12:21,126 --> 01:12:24,472
They cannot fight on two fronts...

624
01:12:25,513 --> 01:12:27,729
Now we make our move.

625
01:12:29,168 --> 01:12:32,072
Attack the city.

626
01:12:34,823 --> 01:12:36,764
Attack.

627
01:12:46,484 --> 01:12:47,866
Azog.

628
01:12:49,368 --> 01:12:51,355
He is trying to cut us off.

629
01:12:56,117 --> 01:12:59,815
Everyone, fall back to Dale.

630
01:13:03,025 --> 01:13:06,750
To the city. Bilbo, this way.

631
01:14:30,248 --> 01:14:32,760
My children. Where are my children?

632
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:35,777
I saw them,
 they were down in the old market.

633
01:14:36,046 --> 01:14:38,952
The Market? Where are they now?

634
01:14:39,262 --> 01:14:44,018
Tilda. Sigrid.
- Bard, the Orcs are storming over the causeway.

635
01:14:45,053 --> 01:14:48,415
Get the bowmen to the Eastern parapet.
Hold them off for as long as you can.

636
01:14:48,425 --> 01:14:50,350
Archers, this way.

637
01:14:50,543 --> 01:14:54,974
The Orcs have taken stone street.
The market's over-run.

638
01:14:58,322 --> 01:15:01,031
The rest of you, follow me.

639
01:15:23,242 --> 01:15:27,278
Charge. Onwards, until they're dead.

640
01:15:59,848 --> 01:16:03,268
Da, Da. Right Here.
We're down here.

641
01:16:30,697 --> 01:16:33,812
Bain, Sigrid, get down.

642
01:16:54,126 --> 01:16:57,478
Listen, I need you to gather the women and children.

643
01:16:57,631 --> 01:17:02,182
Take them to the Great Hall and
barricade the door. You understand?

644
01:17:03,554 --> 01:17:06,447
You must not come out for any reason.
- I want to stay with you.

645
01:17:06,457 --> 01:17:09,556
Show your father some respect.

646
01:17:10,052 --> 01:17:13,897
You leave it to me, Sire.
You heard him, we make to the Great Hall.

647
01:17:16,276 --> 01:17:21,100
Alfrid, women and children only,
I need every man fighting. See that you return.

648
01:17:21,628 --> 01:17:23,236
I'll get them to safety, Sire.

649
01:17:25,087 --> 01:17:28,377
My sword is yours to command.
Get Up.

650
01:17:29,277 --> 01:17:30,743
Look after them.
- I will.

651
01:17:34,046 --> 01:17:35,511
Shift it, granny.

652
01:17:47,415 --> 01:17:49,128
Make for the Great Hall.

653
01:17:51,381 --> 01:17:55,913
Out of my way, we make for the Great Hall.

654
01:18:41,573 --> 01:18:44,557
They cannot hold the city.

655
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:49,219
The dwarves are almost spent.

656
01:18:56,891 --> 01:18:58,375
You *******.

657
01:19:11,416 --> 01:19:15,764
Where's Thorin?
We need him. Where is he?

658
01:19:19,669 --> 01:19:23,151
Let these lands run with blood!

659
01:19:25,295 --> 01:19:27,654
Slaughter them all.

660
01:19:29,168 --> 01:19:31,200
Fall back.

661
01:19:59,806 --> 01:20:02,630
Since when do we forsake our own people?

662
01:20:03,591 --> 01:20:06,780
Thorin, they are dying out there.

663
01:20:12,599 --> 01:20:15,998
There are holes beneath holes
within this mountain.

664
01:20:18,144 --> 01:20:20,257
Places we can fortify.

665
01:20:21,301 --> 01:20:23,400
Shore up, make safe.

666
01:20:28,584 --> 01:20:29,842
Yes!Yes!That is it.

667
01:20:30,430 --> 01:20:33,371
We must move the gold further underground 
for safety.

668
01:20:33,381 --> 01:20:38,331
Did you not hear me. Daine is surrounded.
They're being slaughtered, Thorin.

669
01:20:40,915 --> 01:20:45,125
Many die in war.
Life is cheap.

670
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:52,537
But a treasure such as this
can not be counted in lives lost.

671
01:20:55,622 --> 01:20:59,902
It is worth all the blood, that we spend.

672
01:21:01,221 --> 01:21:06,356
You sit here in these vast halls
with a crown upon your head.

673
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:10,465
And yet you are lesser now than you will ever be.

674
01:21:12,224 --> 01:21:14,088
Do not speak to me...

675
01:21:15,855 --> 01:21:18,793
as if I were some lonely dwarf lord.

676
01:21:19,730 --> 01:21:23,602
As if I were still...

677
01:21:26,565 --> 01:21:30,208
Thorin Oakenshield.

678
01:21:31,765 --> 01:21:35,333
I am your king.
- You were always my king.

679
01:21:35,565 --> 01:21:37,399
I used to know that once, but...

680
01:21:38,805 --> 01:21:41,428
you cannot see what you have become.

681
01:21:45,023 --> 01:21:46,303
Go.

682
01:21:48,691 --> 01:21:50,029
Get out.

683
01:21:52,453 --> 01:21:54,504
Before I kill you.

684
01:22:08,916 --> 01:22:12,101
<i>You sit here with a crown upon your head...</i>

685
01:22:12,414 --> 01:22:15,962
<i>You're lesser now than you were ever be...</i>

686
01:22:16,166 --> 01:22:20,031
<i>A treasure such as this
can not be counted in lives lost</i>

687
01:22:20,041 --> 01:22:24,928
<i>A sickness lies upon that treasure.
- Blind ambition of a mountain king</i>

688
01:22:24,938 --> 01:22:28,951
<i>Am I not a king.?
- It is ours</i>

689
01:22:28,961 --> 01:22:31,130
<i>Only from us</i>

690
01:22:31,809 --> 01:22:37,092
<i>I will not part... With a single coin...</i>

691
01:22:37,102 --> 01:22:42,585
<i>He cannot see beyond his own desire</i>
- I'm not some lonely dwarf lord...Thorin Oakenshield

692
01:22:43,737 --> 01:22:47,931
<i>Look at yourself.
- The same disease as your grandfather</i>

693
01:22:47,941 --> 01:22:50,656
<i>Oakenshield</i>
- This is Thorin...

694
01:22:50,666 --> 01:22:56,516
<i>son of Thrain, son of Thror...
- I'm not like my grandfather</i>

695
01:22:56,526 --> 01:23:00,078
<i>You are the heir to the throne of Durin..
- They are dying out there</i>

696
01:23:00,209 --> 01:23:04,401
<i>Take back Erebor..
- Daine is surrounded</i>

697
01:23:05,036 --> 01:23:10,225
<i>Surrounded...
- Take back your homeland...</i>

698
01:23:10,742 --> 01:23:15,000
<i>You are changed, Thorin.
- I'm not my grandfather</i>

699
01:23:15,094 --> 01:23:20,693
<i>Is this treasure truly worth more than your honor.?
- I'm not my grandfather</i>

700
01:23:33,304 --> 01:23:36,932
<i>This treasure will be your death...</i>

701
01:24:19,043 --> 01:24:23,743
Fall back,
fall back to the mountain..fall back.

702
01:24:31,707 --> 01:24:35,345
Now comes their end.

703
01:24:36,235 --> 01:24:39,233
Prepare for the final assault.

704
01:25:10,385 --> 01:25:16,885
I will not hide behind a wall of stone
while others fight our battles for us.

705
01:25:20,655 --> 01:25:22,875
It is not in my blood, Thorin.

706
01:25:27,724 --> 01:25:30,832
No, that is not.

707
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:34,811
We are sons of Durin.

708
01:25:37,768 --> 01:25:43,234
And Durin's folk do not flee from a fight.

709
01:26:05,905 --> 01:26:10,262
I have no right to ask this of any of you...

710
01:26:15,055 --> 01:26:19,881
but will you follow me one last time?

711
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:33,414
Get ready.

712
01:26:37,810 --> 01:26:41,616
Not yet. Wait...wait...

713
01:26:44,298 --> 01:26:46,481
attack...now!

714
01:27:28,316 --> 01:27:33,825
To the king...To the king.

715
01:27:35,855 --> 01:27:39,698
To the towers.

716
01:27:57,608 --> 01:28:00,474
The dwarves... They're rallying.

717
01:28:03,594 --> 01:28:05,875
Rallying to their king.

718
01:28:09,597 --> 01:28:14,073
Any man who wants to give his life, follow me.

719
01:28:32,780 --> 01:28:39,036
I say we stand with our men
in life and in death. Arm yourselves.

720
01:28:39,823 --> 01:28:42,929
Come with us.
- No,no, leave an old woman...

721
01:28:42,939 --> 01:28:45,391
Do not be afraid.
- I say, "Let them."

722
01:28:47,225 --> 01:28:51,607
Alfrid lickspittle, you're a coward.
- Coward?

723
01:28:51,701 --> 01:28:56,990
Not every man's brave enough to wear a corset.
- You're not a man, you're a weasel.

724
01:29:12,230 --> 01:29:18,670
Dain!
- Thorin! hold on, I'm coming.

725
01:29:25,497 --> 01:29:30,344
Hey, cousin,
why did it take so long?

726
01:29:34,506 --> 01:29:39,613
There are too many of these buggers, Thorin.
Hope you got a plan.

727
01:29:42,007 --> 01:29:44,210
Aye!
We go to take off their leader.

728
01:29:49,758 --> 01:29:54,127
I'm going to kill that piece of filth.
- Come on.

729
01:30:08,201 --> 01:30:12,998
We may yet survive this.
- Gandalf.

730
01:30:20,856 --> 01:30:22,203
It's Thorin.

731
01:30:22,999 --> 01:30:28,803
Fili, Kili, and Dwalin.
He's taking his best warriors.

732
01:30:29,015 --> 01:30:33,498
To do what?
- To cut the head of the snake.

733
01:31:16,377 --> 01:31:18,789
Gandalf.
- Legolas.

734
01:31:21,513 --> 01:31:26,265
There's a second army.
Bolg leads this force of Gundabad Orcs, they're almost upon us.

735
01:31:26,275 --> 01:31:31,001
Gundabad? This was their plan all along.

736
01:31:32,574 --> 01:31:37,098
Azog engages our forces and Bolg sweeps in from the north.

737
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:42,118
...The North?... And where is the North exactly?
- Ravenhill.

738
01:31:43,539 --> 01:31:48,522
Ravenhill? But Thorin is up there, and Fili and Kili,
They're all up there.

739
01:32:04,944 --> 01:32:06,341
Where is he?

740
01:32:11,558 --> 01:32:16,086
Looks empty. I think Azog fled.

741
01:32:17,271 --> 01:32:18,927
I don't think so.

742
01:32:21,881 --> 01:32:26,754
Fili, take your brother.
Scou all the towers.

743
01:32:27,611 --> 01:32:33,173
Keep low and out of sight. If you see something,
report back. Do not engage, do you understand?

744
01:32:33,183 --> 01:32:36,594
We have company, goblin mercenaries.

745
01:32:37,522 --> 01:32:42,199
Not more than a hundred.
- We'll take care of them. Go. Go.

746
01:32:43,350 --> 01:32:44,950
Fili. Come.

747
01:33:13,318 --> 01:33:14,941
Recall your company.

748
01:33:21,066 --> 01:33:26,088
My lord, dispatch this force to Ravenhill.
The dwarves are about to be overrun.

749
01:33:26,098 --> 01:33:29,032
Thorin must be warned.
- By all means warn him.

750
01:33:29,289 --> 01:33:34,396
I've spent much blood in the defence 
of this accursed land.No more.

751
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:39,524
Thranduil?
I'll go.
- Don't br meticulous.

752
01:33:39,692 --> 01:33:42,086
You would never make it.
- Why not?

753
01:33:42,866 --> 01:33:47,596
Because they would see you coming and kill you.
- No they won't.

754
01:33:49,225 --> 01:33:53,183
They won't see me.
- It's out of the question.

755
01:33:54,218 --> 01:33:55,606
I wouldn't allow it.

756
01:33:56,087 --> 01:33:58,438
I am not asking you to allow it, Gandalf.

757
01:34:35,125 --> 01:34:39,590
You will go no further.
You will not turn away.

758
01:34:40,205 --> 01:34:43,724
Not this time.
- Get out of my way.

759
01:34:43,795 --> 01:34:48,304
The dwarfs will be slaughtered.
- Yes, they will die.

760
01:34:48,959 --> 01:34:52,504
Today, tomorrow...

761
01:34:52,514 --> 01:34:57,167
Only hence a hundred years from now.
 What does it matter?

762
01:34:57,831 --> 01:34:59,243
They are mortals.

763
01:35:01,349 --> 01:35:04,364
You think your life is worth more than theirs...

764
01:35:04,662 --> 01:35:10,549
while there is no love in it.
There is no love in you.

765
01:35:16,614 --> 01:35:19,668
What do you know of love? Nothing.

766
01:35:20,402 --> 01:35:23,642
What you feel for that dwarf, is not real.

767
01:35:25,533 --> 01:35:27,275
You think it is love?

768
01:35:28,151 --> 01:35:30,379
Are you ready to die for it?

769
01:35:33,736 --> 01:35:37,455
If you harm her, you will have to kill me.

770
01:35:43,846 --> 01:35:45,224
I will go with you.

771
01:36:07,901 --> 01:36:10,912
Get up.
- Get away from me.

772
01:36:11,173 --> 01:36:15,338
I don't take orders from you.
The people trusted you, they listen to you.

773
01:36:15,543 --> 01:36:18,466
Master's mantle was there for the taking.

774
01:36:19,430 --> 01:36:23,127
And you threw it all away. For what?

775
01:36:32,194 --> 01:36:35,108
Alfrid, your slip is showing.

776
01:36:50,131 --> 01:36:55,251
Stay here, search the lower levels.
I've got this.

777
01:37:04,604 --> 01:37:06,645
Where is that Orc filth?

778
01:37:11,823 --> 01:37:15,987
Thorin!Bilbo!
- You have to leave here now. Azog has 
another army attacking from the north.

779
01:37:15,997 --> 01:37:18,584
This watchtower will be completely surrounded,
there'll be no way out.

780
01:37:18,594 --> 01:37:22,416
We are so close, that Orc scum is in there.
I say we go show him...

781
01:37:23,172 --> 01:37:26,516
No, that's what he wants.
He wants to draw us in.

782
01:37:28,683 --> 01:37:30,347
This is a trap.

783
01:37:45,893 --> 01:37:47,793
Find Fili and Kili, call them back.

784
01:37:47,803 --> 01:37:50,469
Thorin, are you sure about this?
- Do it.

785
01:37:52,594 --> 01:37:54,603
We will get to fight another day.

786
01:38:17,803 --> 01:38:23,189
This one dies first.
Then the brother.

787
01:38:23,370 --> 01:38:27,370
Then you, Oakenshield.

788
01:38:28,064 --> 01:38:31,110
You will die last.
- Go.

789
01:38:35,086 --> 01:38:36,451
Run.

790
01:38:43,410 --> 01:38:45,674
Here ends your filthy bloodline.

791
01:40:31,926 --> 01:40:33,557
Slay them all.

792
01:42:27,405 --> 01:42:29,598
Go in for the kill.

793
01:42:34,192 --> 01:42:36,415
Finish him.

794
01:54:20,667 --> 01:54:22,725
The Eagles are coming.

795
01:55:13,911 --> 01:55:16,015
Bilbo!
- Don't move. Lie still.

796
01:55:20,492 --> 01:55:21,984
I'm glad you're here.

797
01:55:24,301 --> 01:55:26,796
I wish to part from you in friendship.

798
01:55:27,253 --> 01:55:30,927
You're not going anywhere, Thorin.
You're going to live.

799
01:55:31,255 --> 01:55:35,054
I want to take back my words,
of what I said at the gate.

800
01:55:36,375 --> 01:55:38,716
You did what only a true friend would do.

801
01:55:40,496 --> 01:55:41,922
Forgive me.

802
01:55:44,012 --> 01:55:46,025
I was too blind to see.

803
01:55:48,341 --> 01:55:53,007
I am so sorry.
For I have led you to such peril.

804
01:55:54,410 --> 01:55:59,031
I'm glad to sharing with you the experience, Thorin.
Each and everyone of them.

805
01:56:02,251 --> 01:56:05,279
It's far more than any baggins deserves.

806
01:56:09,877 --> 01:56:13,703
Farewell, Master Burglar.

807
01:56:14,948 --> 01:56:19,916
Go back to your books.
And your armchair.

808
01:56:21,738 --> 01:56:25,918
If you plant your trees, watch them grow.

809
01:56:31,186 --> 01:56:32,775
If more people...

810
01:56:34,008 --> 01:56:37,903
valued help above gold...

811
01:56:38,822 --> 01:56:42,758
...this world would be a merrier place.

812
01:56:45,966 --> 01:56:51,112
No, Thorin. Don't you dare.

813
01:57:01,255 --> 01:57:04,794
Thorin, hang on.

814
01:57:04,947 --> 01:57:09,306
Eagles are here.

815
01:58:11,635 --> 01:58:14,522
I can not go back.

816
01:58:15,613 --> 01:58:17,169
Where will you go?

817
01:58:18,231 --> 01:58:19,948
I do not know.

818
01:58:21,173 --> 01:58:24,716
Go north,
find the Dúnadain.

819
01:58:26,649 --> 01:58:29,898
There is a young ranger amongst them. Meet him.

820
01:58:31,166 --> 01:58:34,005
His father, Arathorn, was a good man.

821
01:58:34,684 --> 01:58:38,821
His son might grow to be a greater one.

822
01:58:41,473 --> 01:58:45,968
What is his name?
- He's known in the wild as Strider.

823
01:58:47,032 --> 01:58:51,314
His true name you must discover for yourself.

824
01:58:57,060 --> 01:58:59,742
Legolas!
Your mother loved you.

825
01:59:01,988 --> 01:59:06,240
More than anything. More than life.

826
01:59:42,262 --> 01:59:44,113
I want to bury him.

827
01:59:48,588 --> 01:59:51,546
If this is love, I do not want it.

828
01:59:54,791 --> 01:59:58,921
Take it from me, please.

829
02:00:04,501 --> 02:00:07,055
Why does it hurt so much?

830
02:00:08,178 --> 02:00:10,307
Because it was real.

831
02:02:55,606 --> 02:03:01,507
There's to be a great feast tonight.
Songs will be sung, tales will be told...

832
02:03:03,214 --> 02:03:07,856
And Thorin Oakenshield will pass into legend.

833
02:03:09,238 --> 02:03:12,928
Balin, I know you sound that you must honour him.
But for me it was never that-

834
02:03:14,086 --> 02:03:17,843
He was... Until he...

835
02:03:19,798 --> 02:03:21,129
He was...

836
02:03:28,274 --> 02:03:33,439
I think, I will slip quietly. You tell the
others, I said Goodbye. You can tell them yourself.

837
02:03:49,327 --> 02:03:52,153
If any of you are ever passing Bag-end...

838
02:03:57,777 --> 02:03:59,580
Tea is at four.

839
02:04:00,936 --> 02:04:02,597
There's plenty of it.

840
02:04:05,176 --> 02:04:07,177
You are welcome any time.

841
02:04:15,962 --> 02:04:17,591
Don't bother knocking.

842
02:05:00,577 --> 02:05:05,873
The Borders of the Shire.
T'is here I must leave you.

843
02:05:08,449 --> 02:05:09,696
That's a shame.

844
02:05:12,334 --> 02:05:16,027
I quite like having a wizard
around.

845
02:05:17,435 --> 02:05:18,966
Seems they bring good luck.

846
02:05:20,103 --> 02:05:25,898
You don't really suppose, do you that all your 
adventures and escapes were managed by meer luck. 

847
02:05:26,964 --> 02:05:29,922
Magic rings should not be used lightly, Bilbo.

848
02:05:30,312 --> 02:05:34,681
Don't take me for a fool.
I know you've found one in the goblin tunnels.

849
02:05:34,691 --> 02:05:37,773
And I've kept my eye on you ever since.

850
02:05:41,025 --> 02:05:42,656
Well, thank goodness.

851
02:05:47,532 --> 02:05:49,109
Farewell, Gandalf.

852
02:05:52,090 --> 02:05:53,378
Farewell. 

853
02:06:01,639 --> 02:06:06,864
You needn't worry about that ring.
It fell out of my pocket during the battle.
I lost it.

854
02:06:07,856 --> 02:06:14,347
You're a very fine person, Mr. Baggins.
I'm very fond of you. 

855
02:06:16,307 --> 02:06:22,302
But you're only quite a little fellow,
in a wide world afterall.

856
02:06:53,894 --> 02:06:59,561
That's my mother's closet.
And that's my dining chair...

857
02:07:00,547 --> 02:07:04,195
Put that poof down. What is going on?

858
02:07:04,866 --> 02:07:08,837
Hello, Mr. Bilbo? You're not supposed to be here.

859
02:07:09,184 --> 02:07:13,160
What do you mean?
- I mean, you're kind of presumed dead and all.

860
02:07:13,464 --> 02:07:17,079
I'm not dead.
Presumed otherwise.

861
02:07:18,307 --> 02:07:20,405
I am not sure that's permitted.
Mr. Bilbo!

862
02:07:22,010 --> 02:07:27,155
21, who offers it 21?

863
02:07:27,165 --> 02:07:32,215
<i>AUCTION SALE PROPERTY MR Bilbo Baggins</i>
- Sold to Mrs. Walker. Fine for the feet.

864
02:07:34,931 --> 02:07:40,565
And here I am beautiful...
- Stop.

865
02:07:42,632 --> 02:07:45,182
There has been a mistake.
- Who are you?

866
02:07:45,497 --> 02:07:50,225
Why? You know very well who I am,
Lobelia Sackville-Baggins.

867
02:07:50,235 --> 02:07:55,054
This is my home,
and those are my spoons, thank you very much.

868
02:07:55,064 --> 02:07:59,518
Highly illegal. There are
thirteen months passed since your disappearance.

869
02:08:00,185 --> 02:08:06,626
If you are infact Bilbo Baggins and undeceased,
can you prove it? What?

870
02:08:07,803 --> 02:08:13,390
Something official with your name on it will be sufficient.
- Right.

871
02:08:16,158 --> 02:08:18,854
A contract of employment as a...

872
02:08:21,299 --> 02:08:22,632
Never mind.

873
02:08:24,003 --> 02:08:25,724
There, my signature.

874
02:08:28,293 --> 02:08:33,360
Seems to be in order.
Seems there can be no doubt.

875
02:08:33,675 --> 02:08:36,442
Who is this person you
placed your service to? Thorin Oakenshield?

876
02:08:45,488 --> 02:08:46,939
He was my friend.

877
02:10:41,939 --> 02:10:43,379
No, thank you.

878
02:10:43,389 --> 02:10:47,729
We don't want anymore visitors,
well-wishers or distant relations.

879
02:10:48,511 --> 02:10:51,499
<i>And what about very old friends</i>

880
02:11:02,347 --> 02:11:05,123
<i>Gandalf. Bilbo Baggins.
- Good to see you</i>

881
02:11:05,578 --> 02:11:09,466
<i>113 years old.. Who could believe it?</i>

882
02:11:12,306 --> 02:11:14,943
<i>Enter</i>
