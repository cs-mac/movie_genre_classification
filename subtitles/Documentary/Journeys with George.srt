1
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:22,567
- Get him!
- Don't let him get away!

2
00:00:23,067 --> 00:00:27,667
- Give us that box!
- Oh, not the face!

3
00:00:27,667 --> 00:00:31,233
- Will ya hand it over?
- His arms!

4
00:00:31,233 --> 00:00:34,300
- I got 'em!
- Watch his feet!

5
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,500
Watch out!

6
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,700
Hold still!

7
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,200
You know?
You really don't wanna do this.

8
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,133
So, why don't you just let him go, huh?

9
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:53,100
- Because he's still breathing.
- Yeah?

10
00:00:53,533 --> 00:00:55,800
Well, I think he'd like to
keep it that way. Don't you?

11
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,933
- Wise guy!
- Over here!

12
00:01:35,733 --> 00:01:36,533
Grab me a whip!

13
00:01:36,933 --> 00:01:38,133
- Quickly!
- Let's go!

14
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:39,333
We'll get 'em later!

15
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,133
We need more men!

16
00:01:43,967 --> 00:01:45,567
Ha-ha-ha.

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,067
Not that I couldn't have handled
them myself, but thank you.

18
00:01:50,567 --> 00:01:53,000
Well, it's a little early in the day
for highway robbery, isn't it?

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,500
Oh, not at all.

20
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,500
I try to start every day with
a healthy dose of excitement.

21
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,867
Bandits, lions, lynch mobs,
anything to get the old heart started.

22
00:02:02,267 --> 00:02:03,967
Autolycus is my name.

23
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,667
Iolaus.
Is that the kingdom of Cyros?

24
00:02:08,167 --> 00:02:10,867
It is, indeed.
You have business there?

25
00:02:10,867 --> 00:02:13,000
- Nah, I'm just meeting an old friend.
- Ah.

26
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,133
- This way!
- Over here!

27
00:02:16,633 --> 00:02:17,133
Yeah, I see 'em!

28
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,567
Oh, sounds like those
bandits have returned.

29
00:02:19,567 --> 00:02:21,233
Yeah. Well, if it is them,
they've brought friends.

30
00:02:21,633 --> 00:02:25,300
- Looks like we're surrounded.
- What do you mean, 'We'?

31
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,400
You got me out of trouble, I'm sure
you can do the same for yourself.

32
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:35,533
Yodle... ee... hoo!

33
00:02:39,233 --> 00:02:42,600
- Where's your partner-in-crime?
- My p--

34
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:47,167
- ah, no, no, no. I was just--
- Tell it to the judge.

35
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,567
- You're under arrest.
- What for?

36
00:02:49,967 --> 00:02:52,233
You're standing on it.

37
00:03:15,767 --> 00:03:18,767
Excuse me,
I'm looking for a friend of mine.

38
00:03:18,767 --> 00:03:21,767
He's... oh... about this tall,
blond hair. His name's Iolaus.

39
00:03:22,267 --> 00:03:24,733
I'm sorry. I don't know him.

40
00:03:25,167 --> 00:03:29,600
I just met your little friend.
He gave me this.

41
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,667
Well, if you called him 'Little', you're
lucky that's all he gave you.

42
00:03:34,167 --> 00:03:35,167
Do you know where I can find him?

43
00:03:35,167 --> 00:03:38,567
In prison for stealing
the king's prize ruby.

44
00:03:38,567 --> 00:03:40,500
Punishment is...

45
00:03:42,133 --> 00:03:42,883
Ha!

46
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,967
This is the story of a time long ago.

47
00:03:50,967 --> 00:03:53,233
A time of myth and legend,

48
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,400
when the ancient gods
were petty and cruel,

49
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,067
and they plagued mankind with suffering.

50
00:03:59,067 --> 00:04:04,600
Only one man dared
to challenge their power-Hercules.

51
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:08,000
Hercules possessed a strength
the world had never seen,

52
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,267
a strength surpassed only
by the power of his heart.

53
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,200
He journeyed the earth, battling the
minions of wicked stepmother, Hera,

54
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,667
the all-powerful queen of the gods.

55
00:04:18,667 --> 00:04:22,567
But wherever there was evil,
wherever an innocent would suffer,

56
00:04:22,567 --> 00:04:24,633
there would be Hercules.

57
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Too many moving parts.

58
00:04:57,433 --> 00:05:01,200
I keep telling you think simple.

59
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,933
There's someone here
to see you, my Lord.

60
00:05:05,933 --> 00:05:08,333
Says his name is Hercules.

61
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:14,433
- King Menelaus.
- Hercules?

62
00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:16,667
Hercules, I know that name.

63
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:19,167
Ah, y-you're father's
someone important, isn't he?

64
00:05:19,167 --> 00:05:22,300
Zeus, king of the gods, if that
sort of thing impresses you.

65
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,700
Your Majesty, there's a
man in your jail names Iolaus.

66
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,300
- He's my friend, and--
- Oh, yes, the thief.

67
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,667
We're trying him tomorrow. He-he'll
be executed shortly afterwards.

68
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:35,467
No, now, look at this.
It's a new geared winch.

69
00:05:35,867 --> 00:05:40,800
With it, one man raising a stone
can do the work of four.

70
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,400
- That's very nice, but, uh--
- The problem is, I...

71
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,700
I don't want three out
of four men unemployed,

72
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,300
just for the sake of progress.

73
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,667
I can see where that would be
a problem. Now, about my friend.

74
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:51,367
- Your friend?
- Yes.

75
00:05:51,367 --> 00:05:56,100
Oh-oh, yes, yes.
Well, he plundered my treasury.

76
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,567
I mean, we still haven't
recovered the stone from my set.

77
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:03,400
It's a dragon's-eye ruby given
to my great-great-grandmother

78
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,833
by Maleus the Mighty. Ha-ha.

79
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:10,067
Maleus had no easy job persuading
the dragon to give it up.

80
00:06:10,067 --> 00:06:11,933
Iolaus would never
do anything like that.

81
00:06:12,433 --> 00:06:16,367
He's the most honest person I know.

82
00:06:16,367 --> 00:06:18,617
Then why doesn't he
tell us where the ruby is?

83
00:06:18,617 --> 00:06:19,933
- Because he didn't take it.
- Oh-ho!

84
00:06:19,933 --> 00:06:23,333
I'll be the judge of that literally.

85
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,083
Oh!

86
00:06:28,567 --> 00:06:33,567
Dirce... ha.
She's famous for her entrances.

87
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:36,000
- That's wonderful.
- Yes, you better say that.

88
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
She's your friend's lawyer.

89
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:43,717
Hi.

90
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,300
Maybe there's something both
of you should know about Cyros.

91
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,100
No crime goes unpunished here.
It's the law.

92
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,700
Unfortunately, when the real
culprit can't be found

93
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,200
- innocent people have been executed.
- Oh-ho! Good!

94
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,200
I'm sorry, but the law is
part of our tradition.

95
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,700
And as much as the king
loves things that are

96
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,000
new tradition gets
the best of him every time.

97
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,300
And you're willing to let your
tradition kill an innocent man.

98
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,967
I only care about
protecting my clients.

99
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:17,433
Justice for the people.

100
00:07:17,433 --> 00:07:19,867
Humanity before tradition.

101
00:07:20,367 --> 00:07:24,567
But frankly, if we don't catch the
real thief his goose is cooked.

102
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,333
Well?

103
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,933
- His name was Autolycus.
- Autolycus?

104
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:37,900
- You know who that is?
- Everybody around here knows Autolycus.

105
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,433
The peasants call him,
'The King of Thieves'.

106
00:07:40,433 --> 00:07:45,100
I have his description here. There.

107
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,900
The king's constables
swear he's uncatchable.

108
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,933
And Autolycus has said that he'd
rather die than be brought to justice.

109
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,500
Well, you're about to find out
if he's true to his word

110
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,467
- because I'm going to catch him.
- Well, you'd better hurry.

111
00:07:56,467 --> 00:07:59,167
The king has decreed that
the trial starts tomorrow.

112
00:07:59,167 --> 00:08:03,433
They don't waste
any time here, do they?

113
00:08:03,933 --> 00:08:07,900
- How are you at stalling?
- I may be able to get you three days.

114
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,400
Yeah? What if it takes more
than three days to catch him?

115
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,400
Well, then I'll make sure that

116
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,333
the king feels guily about
beheading the wrong man.

117
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,800
- Autolycus, right?
- Ah, you've heard of me.

118
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,667
Not until yesterday. I believe you took
something that doesn't belong to you.

119
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:01,267
Rumor and innuendo.

120
00:09:08,867 --> 00:09:10,067
Oop!

121
00:09:10,067 --> 00:09:10,817
Uh!

122
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You're too easy. You know that?

123
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I thought the King of Thieves
would be harder to catch.

124
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,500
- Who are you?
- Hercules... heard of me?

125
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Oh! We-ell,
that makes perfect sense!

126
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,500
Only the son of Zeus
could've found me!

127
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,967
Well, you left quite a trail.

128
00:09:30,967 --> 00:09:31,933
See, next time you're
running from the law,

129
00:09:32,433 --> 00:09:34,433
don't stop to shake hands with
every villager you meet.

130
00:09:34,433 --> 00:09:37,767
Oh, but Hercules, how can
I deny them? The people love me.

131
00:09:38,167 --> 00:09:39,900
- Force yourself.
- I'd rather do this.

132
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,600
You're only making more
trouble for yourself.

133
00:09:51,067 --> 00:09:56,233
If I didn't like trouble, I would've
gone into a different line of work.

134
00:09:57,033 --> 00:09:59,867
Yodle-ee-hoo!

135
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:03,067
Maybe this isn't going to be so easy.

136
00:10:04,067 --> 00:10:06,067
The thief is to be
escorted to the court.

137
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:08,067
- The alleged thief.
- Whatever.

138
00:10:08,067 --> 00:10:09,567
No convictions without a trial!

139
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,067
Here is is, provision 99 the
review of evidence by outside audit.

140
00:10:16,067 --> 00:10:19,000
That'll easily take up
two-and-a-half days.

141
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Of course, that still doesn't give your
friend much time to catch Autolycus.

142
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,833
- Well, if anyone can, Hercules can.
- It'll still vex him, though.

143
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:30,333
- Who?
- The king, he's very impatient.

144
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,767
He'll probably regret
accepting my proposal.

145
00:10:32,767 --> 00:10:35,233
- What proposal?
- Counsel for the defense.

146
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:38,567
- I'm the one who came up with the idea.
- I'm surprised he agreed to it.

147
00:10:38,567 --> 00:10:40,733
Ha-ha.
He likes to think he's progressive.

148
00:10:41,133 --> 00:10:43,833
Ha! What a joke! Oh.

149
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:47,000
Would ya mind getting that for me?

150
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:49,867
Yah!

151
00:10:53,867 --> 00:10:55,067
Excuse me.

152
00:11:03,233 --> 00:11:04,233
Excuse me.

153
00:11:04,233 --> 00:11:07,233
Ha-have you seen a tall man
with dark hair and a green tunic?

154
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,233
He might have tried
to shake your hand.

155
00:11:09,733 --> 00:11:11,733
Do you mean Autolycus.

156
00:11:12,233 --> 00:11:15,233
- None other.
- Sorry, not today.

157
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:17,233
Is there anywhere
else to cross the river?

158
00:11:17,233 --> 00:11:22,867
Oh, footbridge twenty miles
downstream. But it washed away.

159
00:11:32,167 --> 00:11:34,167
Thanks for your help.

160
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,500
You'll never catch him, you know.

161
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,500
Oh! Excuse me!

162
00:11:53,933 --> 00:11:58,500
- Autolycus!
- Ooh. Oop! Pardon me!

163
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,567
Go, Autolycus! Go!

164
00:12:00,567 --> 00:12:03,433
You'll never catch
The King of Thieves!

165
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,833
Yodle-ee-hoo!

166
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,400
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

167
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,867
Ah, even the great Hercules is
no match for The King of Thieves.

168
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,767
Can't you do any better? I learned
that trick when I was a boy.

169
00:12:55,767 --> 00:12:59,600
Sorry, Hercules.
But I've got a reputation to maintain.

170
00:13:00,067 --> 00:13:01,967
I'm afraid I've got to ruin it.

171
00:13:06,867 --> 00:13:07,833
Yah!

172
00:13:11,767 --> 00:13:15,067
Oh, oh, oh, gods above, put me down!

173
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:22,333
So much for the direct approach.

174
00:13:32,233 --> 00:13:34,033
It's been a pleasure, Hercules!

175
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,400
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

176
00:13:38,867 --> 00:13:39,367
Oh!

177
00:13:39,367 --> 00:13:40,367
Ooh!

178
00:13:41,867 --> 00:13:42,617
Ah!

179
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:48,900
Uh-oh.

180
00:13:58,167 --> 00:14:05,700
The evidence is in. Counsel has
two minutes for closing arguments.

181
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:11,367
Your lordship, I propose that all
evidence here today be subject

182
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:16,000
to Provision 99 the review of
evidence by outside audit.

183
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,800
Ah, that won't be possible, Counselor.
I retired Abagustus yesterday.

184
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,767
- What?
- Who's Abagustus?

185
00:14:22,767 --> 00:14:25,933
The only outside auditor in Cyros.
How could you let him retire?

186
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:29,567
Dirce, the man is 97 years old.

187
00:14:30,033 --> 00:14:33,300
The only thing he's got
energy for is to sleep.

188
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,300
So if you can't think of
anything better than that--

189
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:40,300
J-just wait a minute.
OK, I-I'm sure there's something.

190
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,800
Ah.

191
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,433
- Provision 46.
- That's strictly for maritime insurrections.

192
00:14:50,433 --> 00:14:52,400
Oh, right.

193
00:14:53,267 --> 00:15:01,167
Um... well...
amendment 12 K to Provision 7.

194
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:06,100
Applies only to politicians with
records of heredit'ry insanity.

195
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,467
Oh, yes. Um...

196
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:14,600
Time is running out, Counselor.

197
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,833
The court is ready to pass judgment.

198
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:24,267
I propose that the court
enact the Erebus test

199
00:15:24,267 --> 00:15:29,400
- the ancient test of innocence.
- But that could take days.

200
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,133
- And besides, it's barbaric.
- But, it's part of the traditional law.

201
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:38,367
And that's the most important thing,
isn't it? Tradition.

202
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,300
Very well, Dirce.

203
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,100
The court will indulge you
though I personally think it

204
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,567
would be more humane to
let us execute the defendant.

205
00:15:52,967 --> 00:15:57,933
The court is recessed for two hours.
We will reconvene at the pond.

206
00:15:59,233 --> 00:16:01,033
Got him! Ha-ha.

207
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:09,067
- Barbaric?
- Hmm.

208
00:16:35,367 --> 00:16:38,367
I don't suppose you'd
care ta-- give me a hand?

209
00:16:38,367 --> 00:16:41,133
Hey, you're the escape artist.

210
00:16:44,567 --> 00:16:49,000
But, maybe you're losing your touch.

211
00:16:54,467 --> 00:16:57,967
Ooh! Oh! Ha-ha-ha-ha. Thank you.

212
00:16:58,467 --> 00:17:00,900
- You're welcome.
- Yo!

213
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,740
Ah! Ah!

214
00:17:05,367 --> 00:17:07,267
I have to tell you, Hercules--
mm-mm...

215
00:17:07,767 --> 00:17:09,267
this is going to put a
strain on our friendship.

216
00:17:09,267 --> 00:17:13,767
- Oh!
- What friendship?

217
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:19,667
- Ah!
- You stole this,

218
00:17:19,667 --> 00:17:21,167
and left my best friend
to be executed for it.

219
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:24,167
I didn't plan it that way. I
thought he could take care of himself!

220
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:25,167
- If you'd seen how he'd wiped out--
- Save your breath!

221
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,733
All I care about is getting you
where you belong in court.

222
00:17:31,233 --> 00:17:33,733
That should hold ya.
Have a nice swim!

223
00:17:37,733 --> 00:17:41,233
Explain to me again how this is
gonna prove my innocence?

224
00:17:41,233 --> 00:17:45,400
It’s called 'dunking'. You and
the rock are thrown into the water.

225
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,467
- If you drown, you're guilty.
- Oh, well, that makes sense.

226
00:17:49,467 --> 00:17:50,800
Look, I know it sounds ridiculous

227
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,300
but it was the only
delaying tactic left me.

228
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,900
- Oh, one other thing.
- What?

229
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,700
Don't swallow the water.
It's filthy.

230
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,500
Let's get this over with.
The agriculture commission has a

231
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,500
a pig-breeding crisis
I need to deal with.

232
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,100
- Here!
- Ah, any more advice?

233
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,700
- One, two.
- Keep your head above water.

234
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,900
Thank you.

235
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,333
You're only prolonging
your client's agony.

236
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:20,200
I am looking after his rights.

237
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,100
Strange way of doing it.

238
00:18:32,133 --> 00:18:34,433
You're wasting your time.

239
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:45,667
Trust me, I know something
about prison doors.

240
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:47,667
I didn't think ya ever
wound up behind them.

241
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:50,667
You know, since you're uncatchable.

242
00:18:51,167 --> 00:18:55,167
The only times the jackals of authority
catch me is when I let them.

243
00:18:55,167 --> 00:19:00,167
Then of course, I escape immediately,
so they know I can't be stopped.

244
00:19:03,667 --> 00:19:05,167
Oh-ho-ho!

245
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:07,167
Very impressive.

246
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,100
Ha!

247
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,500
Guess I'll be running along.

248
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,433
You are really starting to annoy me.

249
00:19:20,433 --> 00:19:25,633
Time's up. We're draggin'
the carcass out of the water.

250
00:19:30,033 --> 00:19:35,233
You made it! You survived!

251
00:19:36,033 --> 00:19:37,633
Yeah! I, uh...

252
00:19:37,633 --> 00:19:41,233
managed to slow down
my heartbeat so I could

253
00:19:41,233 --> 00:19:44,433
hold my breath until
I got up to the surface.

254
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:48,033
- It's a trick I learned in the East.
- Well, it worked.

255
00:19:48,033 --> 00:19:50,133
You've passed the first test.

256
00:19:50,133 --> 00:19:54,367
- First test?
- Just two more.

257
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:58,067
I hope they're a lot
easier than this one was.

258
00:19:58,467 --> 00:19:59,667
Ahh...

259
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:01,267
On your feet!

260
00:20:02,867 --> 00:20:06,467
- What's next?
- It’s called 'Pressing'.

261
00:20:06,867 --> 00:20:09,267
Pressing. Pressing?

262
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,700
Now all ya hafta do is
stand there for an hour,

263
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,200
- and not let any stones fall.
- Ah, great. No problem.

264
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,700
You know?
We can beat the system yet!

265
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,633
That'll show my father
I know what I'm doing.

266
00:20:39,133 --> 00:20:41,067
Who's your father?

267
00:20:41,067 --> 00:20:43,700
- The king, of course.
- The king? Wow!

268
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,167
Look out!

269
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,967
That was close. Now, don't worry.

270
00:20:54,967 --> 00:20:57,400
Winning this case has become
a personal matter to me.

271
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,367
Yeah, it's, uh...
kind of personal for me, too.

272
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:07,733
Ooh!

273
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:08,933
Whoo.

274
00:21:08,933 --> 00:21:11,733
Well, this place certainly has a lot of,
uh, character.

275
00:21:11,733 --> 00:21:13,733
Interesting design, don't you think?

276
00:21:13,733 --> 00:21:17,367
Early Assyrian, but with definite
neo-Babylonian influences.

277
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:31,200
Oh, the Fates have been kind.
I've died and gone to Olympus.

278
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,867
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!
Will ya look at all this?

279
00:21:35,867 --> 00:21:37,900
- Keep your voice down.
- Why, you and

280
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,300
I could clean out this whole
place in a couple of days, Hercules.

281
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,867
I don't have a couple of days.

282
00:21:42,867 --> 00:21:45,300
All right, well,
we'll just take what we need.

283
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,400
Uh, half for me and some for you.
Come on!

284
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,400
Untie my hands.

285
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,867
Would you desert a castle
and leave all this behind?

286
00:21:53,867 --> 00:21:54,867
What are you getting at?

287
00:21:55,367 --> 00:21:59,267
Whatever drove these
people away did it in a hurry.

288
00:22:00,933 --> 00:22:04,333
- And it's still here.
- Don't be ridiculous.

289
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:08,867
Nothing's lived in here
for centuries! Ha-ha.

290
00:22:08,867 --> 00:22:12,733
Whoa. Whoa.

291
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:18,633
Maybe, 'Ridiculous'
wasn't the right word.

292
00:22:29,367 --> 00:22:32,367
You don't suppose
it's avegetarian, do ya?

293
00:22:32,367 --> 00:22:37,767
Sh! Back up slowly.
No sudden movements.

294
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,200
I'd call that a sudden movement!

295
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Oh.

296
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,433
If it doesn't eat us,
it'll kill us with its breath!

297
00:23:08,433 --> 00:23:14,767
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Oooooh!

298
00:23:14,767 --> 00:23:16,267
Oh!

299
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,667
Well, that's better!

300
00:23:52,167 --> 00:23:55,100
- What, now?
- I'm thinking! I'm thinking!

301
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,067
Well, while you think I'll get the door.

302
00:24:07,433 --> 00:24:08,900
Ohh.

303
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,400
Ah.

304
00:24:39,167 --> 00:24:47,833
Ohhh. I like it.

305
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:52,133
Ooh! Boy, you are good!

306
00:24:52,633 --> 00:24:54,100
Ooh!

307
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,933
I think we scared it.

308
00:25:08,033 --> 00:25:10,033
Father, what are you doing?

309
00:25:13,767 --> 00:25:15,267
- I can't quite get this to work.
- Ha.

310
00:25:15,767 --> 00:25:18,267
- We're all waiting outside!
- Oh, Dirce.

311
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,667
Just how long does
this game have to go on?

312
00:25:21,167 --> 00:25:24,167
Justice is not a game. Justice is life.

313
00:25:24,167 --> 00:25:26,033
Yes, yes, I've heard all that before.

314
00:25:26,533 --> 00:25:28,767
Oh! Will you stop that?

315
00:25:29,167 --> 00:25:31,767
Now why can't you start
behaving like a normal king?

316
00:25:32,267 --> 00:25:33,900
Why can't you behave
like a normal princess,

317
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,800
instead of some budding old maid,
who doesn't have anything

318
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,200
in her life except screwball causes?
Feed the stag beetle!

319
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,667
- Save the Harpies!
- Well, at least I believe in something.

320
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:46,667
You think I don't.

321
00:25:46,667 --> 00:25:49,967
I cling to tradition
because I am trying

322
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:53,767
to preserve our way
of life here in Cyros.

323
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,200
What more do you want from me?

324
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:04,367
I want you to care about people as
much as you care about your inventions.

325
00:26:04,367 --> 00:26:08,700
None of 'em work, anyway!

326
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:14,633
Come on. Let's get this
Erebus test over with.

327
00:26:22,533 --> 00:26:23,833
Would a look at that?

328
00:26:34,833 --> 00:26:35,833
Move along!

329
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:37,700
You made it!

330
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:41,833
Yeah. There was nothing to it.

331
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:45,467
I just had to separate
my mind from my body,

332
00:26:45,867 --> 00:26:48,267
and kind of become
one with the rocks.

333
00:26:48,667 --> 00:26:51,067
Listen to the poor devil.
He's ranting!

334
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:53,867
We should put him out
of his misery right now.

335
00:26:54,267 --> 00:26:57,867
You'll do no such thing. He can
take anything you throw at him.

336
00:26:57,867 --> 00:27:01,267
Yeah.
What are you gonna throw at me?

337
00:27:01,267 --> 00:27:03,233
A wild boar?

338
00:27:03,233 --> 00:27:05,233
You'll be in this pit
with it for three hours.

339
00:27:05,233 --> 00:27:08,233
All you have to do is stay
alive and not lose any blood.

340
00:27:08,733 --> 00:27:11,233
Three hours?

341
00:27:12,733 --> 00:27:14,667
I can do that.

342
00:27:17,367 --> 00:27:19,367
In with him, then.

343
00:27:32,533 --> 00:27:35,500
- That boar is bigger than a horse.
- It doesn't matter, Iolaus.

344
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:39,333
You're gonna get through this.
I know you are.

345
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:42,267
We're waiting.

346
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:49,167
I'll see ya in three hours.

347
00:27:53,667 --> 00:27:55,667
This pig is huge!

348
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:04,533
- Well?
- It's a door.

349
00:28:05,533 --> 00:28:08,033
They don't make them
like that, anymore.

350
00:28:08,033 --> 00:28:11,533
There must be a winch
around here, somewhere.

351
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,433
Oh, that'll take forever.

352
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:22,867
All right. Here, let me help.

353
00:28:24,367 --> 00:28:25,367
Oh!

354
00:28:25,867 --> 00:28:29,367
Nothing larger than the
Parthenon, please.

355
00:28:31,867 --> 00:28:33,867
That's more like it.

356
00:28:34,367 --> 00:28:36,367
Can't risk damaging these
magic hands, you know?

357
00:28:36,867 --> 00:28:39,867
Right. Think of all the innocent people
that would keep you from robbing.

358
00:28:39,867 --> 00:28:45,367
Now, if I had my druthers which
I admit isn't always the case

359
00:28:45,367 --> 00:28:48,867
I would focus on the
corrupt and decadent.

360
00:28:48,867 --> 00:28:52,867
That's how I got into this
business, as a matter of fact.

361
00:28:52,867 --> 00:28:54,867
A bloated merchant from
Cyros tricked my brother,

362
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:56,867
Melaegus, out of his land.

363
00:28:57,367 --> 00:29:00,867
And when Melaegus protested,
the merchant had him killed.

364
00:29:01,367 --> 00:29:03,367
And the powers that be
did nothing about it.

365
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:05,367
So I delivered my own justice.

366
00:29:05,867 --> 00:29:07,800
I robbed that merchant,
and I gave every dinar

367
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:12,200
he had to the sick,
the hungry, the poor.

368
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,167
The merchant became a pauper.

369
00:29:14,633 --> 00:29:18,133
And well I became an outlaw.

370
00:29:22,133 --> 00:29:25,967
But not just any outlaw, either.

371
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,300
- If you don't mind.
- That's all right.

372
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,300
I'll get it back.
After all, I am The King of Thieves.

373
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,800
Save it for court.

374
00:29:40,267 --> 00:29:43,567
You really are serious about
taking me back, aren't you?

375
00:29:43,567 --> 00:29:46,033
- You bet I am.
- Well, that's very Herculean,

376
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,433
but you see, there's
just one small catch.

377
00:29:48,933 --> 00:29:52,833
If your friend lives, that means I die.

378
00:29:59,633 --> 00:30:01,633
Time's up. Lift the lid.

379
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,633
Lift the lid!

380
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:32,367
You're alive! You're wonderful!

381
00:30:32,367 --> 00:30:35,367
I'm better than that, Dirce.
I'm free!

382
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:37,867
What did you do?

383
00:30:37,867 --> 00:30:41,367
I let him chase me around
for a while till he got exhausted.

384
00:30:41,867 --> 00:30:43,867
And then I summoned up all
my energy I looked him

385
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:48,033
straight in the eyes and
I put him into a trance.

386
00:30:48,033 --> 00:30:50,000
It's an old hunters' trick.

387
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,167
- Ow!
- Well, Father...

388
00:30:54,167 --> 00:30:57,033
he has passed all of the
steps of the Erebus test.

389
00:30:57,033 --> 00:31:02,933
Ooh, you... you make a good point,
Dirce. There is no-- oh.

390
00:31:02,933 --> 00:31:06,467
Oh, wait a minute.

391
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:10,967
He bleeds.

392
00:31:12,267 --> 00:31:15,067
You have got to be kidding!

393
00:31:15,067 --> 00:31:19,433
You know, I've played your games!
I passed your stupid tests!

394
00:31:19,867 --> 00:31:21,767
And now, you're gonna
condemn me for cutting my finger

395
00:31:21,767 --> 00:31:25,867
after I escaped from your pet boar?
You people are crazy!

396
00:31:25,867 --> 00:31:28,167
Hey. Don't talk to the king like that.

397
00:31:28,167 --> 00:31:30,167
- Or you'll get in real trouble.
- Ha!

398
00:31:30,667 --> 00:31:34,167
- How much more trouble can I get in?
- Da-enough of this jibber-jabber!

399
00:31:34,167 --> 00:31:37,633
Dirce, you asked for the
Erebus test and you got it.

400
00:31:38,133 --> 00:31:42,000
Your client has proven
himself guilty beyond a doubt.

401
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,933
He will be executed at dusk.

402
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:04,700
- Well, I hope it still works.
- There's one way to find out.

403
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:16,533
Ohh, it looks like a beautiful
day in the neighborhood.

404
00:32:16,533 --> 00:32:17,967
But how are we gonna
keep that thing up

405
00:32:17,967 --> 00:32:19,900
long enough to get out
there and enjoy it?

406
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,900
Find something to brace the wheel.

407
00:32:27,267 --> 00:32:28,267
Hurry up!

408
00:32:39,033 --> 00:32:41,033
Ha.

409
00:32:45,067 --> 00:32:49,667
Wrong place... wrong time.

410
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:51,167
Find something?

411
00:32:52,033 --> 00:32:54,567
Ah, a little more than I wanted to.

412
00:32:57,067 --> 00:33:00,500
Oh, quick! Brace the wheel!

413
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,467
Oh, oh, the wheel.

414
00:33:01,467 --> 00:33:01,967
Um...

415
00:33:01,967 --> 00:33:03,267
Go on! Get out of here!

416
00:33:03,267 --> 00:33:03,667
You're sure?

417
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:05,500
Go!

418
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,933
Come on, Hercules! Uh!

419
00:33:47,833 --> 00:33:49,267
What do you think you're doing?

420
00:33:49,267 --> 00:33:50,533
I need this.

421
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:57,733
I told you to get out of here!

422
00:33:57,733 --> 00:34:00,167
Don't you worry about me, Hercules.

423
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:28,233
Autolycus!

424
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:38,733
Let's get you outta here.

425
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,600
Autolycus, you all right?

426
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,600
I was gonna run away while
your back was turned,

427
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:59,033
but I can't seem to stand.

428
00:35:59,033 --> 00:36:04,733
- Then don't try.
- I don't think I can move my legs.

429
00:36:04,733 --> 00:36:08,700
You could have escaped?
Why'd you come back to help me?

430
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,733
Oh. A... a lapse in judgment.

431
00:36:13,233 --> 00:36:15,567
I don't think so.

432
00:36:16,567 --> 00:36:19,067
Look, Hercules...

433
00:36:20,567 --> 00:36:25,000
I don't want your friend to die
because of something I've done.

434
00:36:25,467 --> 00:36:29,233
It would... ha... spoil my image.
Mmm.

435
00:36:29,233 --> 00:36:32,633
- Can't have that, can we?
- Mmm...

436
00:36:33,133 --> 00:36:37,900
but I'm afraid you're gonna have
to carry me back to Cyros.

437
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,233
Mmm.

438
00:36:40,067 --> 00:36:42,467
And I think you'd better hurry.

439
00:36:45,033 --> 00:36:48,233
Father, I can't let you do this not
when you know he's innocent.

440
00:36:48,633 --> 00:36:52,633
But tradition must be honored.
It's what keeps us civilized.

441
00:36:52,633 --> 00:36:56,667
Well if this is civilized, then I wish
you'd execute me instead of Iolaus.

442
00:36:56,667 --> 00:36:59,100
Come on! I'll even put
my head on the block for you!

443
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,100
- Guards!
- Dirce, no!

444
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:01,900
- Get her away from there!
- Nooo!

445
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,100
Dirce!

446
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,700
Dirce!

447
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,300
I can't let you die.

448
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,900
Just keep fighting for
justice and reason.

449
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:21,500
If you do that it won't
have been for nothing.

450
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,533
Father... please.

451
00:37:27,033 --> 00:37:30,167
I'm sorry, Dirce.

452
00:37:30,567 --> 00:37:32,400
Proceed.

453
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:52,067
I-it's not as bad as it seems, my boy.

454
00:37:52,467 --> 00:37:55,267
With this chopping device my
inventors have perfected... uh,

455
00:37:55,667 --> 00:37:58,933
there'll be no more
sloppy work with an ax.

456
00:37:58,933 --> 00:38:00,733
Uh, what a relief.

457
00:38:01,567 --> 00:38:07,667
I-i-if there's anything
you wish to say... say it now.

458
00:38:07,667 --> 00:38:15,000
Two things actually I'm innocent and
you should be nicer to your daughter.

459
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,067
Should I enter that in
the record, your Highness?

460
00:38:19,067 --> 00:38:23,267
Yes. Well, tradition gives
us no other choice.

461
00:38:23,667 --> 00:38:25,433
Commence the execution!

462
00:38:33,767 --> 00:38:36,967
Father, if you do this
I will never forgive you.

463
00:38:37,367 --> 00:38:39,833
I have told you, I am sorry.

464
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:42,467
What has begun here is
bigger than both of us.

465
00:38:47,467 --> 00:38:49,367
Stop!

466
00:38:49,367 --> 00:38:51,567
What is this?

467
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:57,700
Hercules! Where have you been?

468
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:00,667
You were supposed
to give me three days.

469
00:39:02,967 --> 00:39:06,900
- How you doing?
- Oh, you know, I've had better days.

470
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:11,000
How-how dare you put this
stranger on the royal throne?

471
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,167
Your Highness, say hello to Autolycus.

472
00:39:15,667 --> 00:39:19,733
- The King of Thieves?
- Ah, you've heard of me.

473
00:39:19,733 --> 00:39:21,733
He's here as a
witness for the defense.

474
00:39:21,733 --> 00:39:23,333
Well, you...
you better be quick about it.

475
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:24,933
We're in the middle of an execution!

476
00:39:24,933 --> 00:39:28,467
You shouldn't be.
You're executing the wrong man.

477
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:35,067
- Yeah, that's my point, exactly!
- He didn't rob the royal vault.

478
00:39:35,067 --> 00:39:38,467
Ha-ha-ha. I did.

479
00:39:41,433 --> 00:39:45,233
- It's the dragon's eye ruby!
- You, sir...

480
00:39:45,233 --> 00:39:52,100
have had the honor of being robbed
by the greatest thief of all time.

481
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,467
Autolycus!

482
00:39:56,667 --> 00:39:59,867
Thank you, Hercules. Ha.

483
00:39:59,867 --> 00:40:04,767
My mission is complete.

484
00:40:12,733 --> 00:40:15,700
The rope! Father, do something!

485
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,567
But nothing like this has
ever happened in Cyros!

486
00:40:20,567 --> 00:40:22,567
- Ah, terrific.
- Iolaus is not thief.

487
00:40:22,567 --> 00:40:24,067
You know that for a fact.
Now, let him go!

488
00:40:24,533 --> 00:40:26,833
- But tradition!
- Humanity is more important.

489
00:40:26,833 --> 00:40:30,167
- Start a new tradition.
- We could make a campaign of it.

490
00:40:30,167 --> 00:40:34,567
'Menelaus a new king for a new day.'
You could rewrite the old laws.

491
00:40:34,567 --> 00:40:38,567
Rewrite the laws! Rewrite the laws?
I can do that?

492
00:40:38,567 --> 00:40:42,000
- You're the king.
- Would you help me?

493
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
You know I would.

494
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,800
Let him go!

495
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:12,700
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

496
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,100
- How did you get him to confess?
- He did it on his own.

497
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:20,233
Autolycus, wasn't as bad as
he wanted you to believe.

498
00:41:20,233 --> 00:41:24,733
Proof of that is right here.
Take this to the royal vault.

499
00:41:24,733 --> 00:41:27,733
And prepare Autolycus'
body for a state funeral.

500
00:41:29,667 --> 00:41:34,567
- He's gone.
- I wish I could say I was surprised.

501
00:41:36,467 --> 00:41:39,067
Where's my money pouch?

502
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,500
I can't say I'm surprised
about that, either.

503
00:41:46,367 --> 00:41:47,867
Iolaus!

504
00:41:50,867 --> 00:41:54,867
Maybe if we'd been better hosts,
you'd, stay longer?

505
00:41:54,867 --> 00:41:57,367
You and your father have
a lot of work to do.

506
00:41:57,867 --> 00:41:59,367
I'll come back when
things settle down.

507
00:41:59,367 --> 00:42:04,367
I hope so. You haven't seen the
best part of our country, yet.

508
00:42:04,367 --> 00:42:08,367
Oh, I think I have.

509
00:42:10,367 --> 00:42:11,367
Huh.

510
00:42:31,167 --> 00:42:35,567
Ah, Dirce. You know,
I left my heart in Cyros.

511
00:42:36,067 --> 00:42:38,067
- Yeah, but ya kept your head.
- Good afternoon.

512
00:42:38,067 --> 00:42:40,500
- Good afternoon.
- Afternoon.

513
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,367
Someone you know?

514
00:42:45,367 --> 00:42:47,133
It could be.

515
00:42:49,433 --> 00:42:53,900
Want to go after him and make sure?

516
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,900
Nope.

517
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,400
OK.

518
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:05,533
