1
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:01,719
If it was easy,
everybody would be good at it.

2
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,255
I was told that
long time ago by a coach.

3
00:02:04,256 --> 00:02:05,523
If you want something
you never had before,

4
00:02:05,524 --> 00:02:08,560
you gotta be willing to do something
you've never done before.

5
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:10,662
That's what I live by.

6
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:12,864
I want to be two-time
Mr. Olympia.

7
00:02:12,865 --> 00:02:15,532
I have to be willing to do
whatever it takes.

8
00:02:15,533 --> 00:02:17,501
You know, the record
is eight Mr. Olympia titles

9
00:02:17,502 --> 00:02:19,904
held by Lee Haney
and Ronnie Colman.

10
00:02:19,905 --> 00:02:23,208
Arnold Schwarzenegger won seven,
Jay Cutler won four.

11
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:27,278
I think for me it's just, I'm
already the best at what I do.

12
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:31,615
I had to ask myself a serious question, which
was, can I get better than what I just did?

13
00:02:31,616 --> 00:02:34,352
And it was like, the next day
at a photo shoot, I knew.

14
00:02:34,353 --> 00:02:35,887
I don't like the way
I look right there.

15
00:02:35,888 --> 00:02:37,522
People would say,
"Are you crazy?

16
00:02:37,523 --> 00:02:38,656
You just beat everybody!

17
00:02:38,657 --> 00:02:41,392
You won with a perfect score."

18
00:02:41,393 --> 00:02:43,228
But in my heart, I knew,
I was like,

19
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:44,796
"Phil, this
is just the beginning."

20
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:47,365
Your legacy is not gonna to be
dictated on winning one Olympia,

21
00:02:47,366 --> 00:02:49,535
it's going to be dictated
on how many.

22
00:02:52,837 --> 00:02:55,540
For all bodybuilders,
the experience is similar.

23
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:59,943
They are an oddity,
stares, pointed fingers.

24
00:02:59,944 --> 00:03:03,847
They're in a freak show with
no circus tent to hide away in.

25
00:03:03,848 --> 00:03:07,852
For the 32-year-old champ,
it's an honor,

26
00:03:07,853 --> 00:03:10,755
an honor that fuels
his drive to secure position

27
00:03:10,756 --> 00:03:14,659
as the greatest bodybuilder
of his day,

28
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:18,596
to prove that
his win was no fluke.

29
00:03:18,597 --> 00:03:22,767
- All right, take care.
- Thank you!

30
00:03:22,768 --> 00:03:26,237
There's a lot of people out there wondering,
"Can he do it again?"

31
00:03:26,238 --> 00:03:28,673
So it's my job to remind them

32
00:03:28,674 --> 00:03:32,543
and the world that I am
the champion.

33
00:03:32,544 --> 00:03:34,380
And I'm gonna be here
for awhile.

Please take the first-place
award, the Olympia Gold Metal,

66
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:30,688
the Sandow Bronze Award,
and the title

67
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:35,159
of 2011 Mr. Olympia

68
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,664
to our winner tonight...

69
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:40,666
Phil Heath!

70
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,011
Bodybuilding falls into this
unique category

71
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:06,850
of, you know, being a sport,
being entertainment,

72
00:08:06,851 --> 00:08:11,222
being a way of life,
and being also art.

73
00:08:11,223 --> 00:08:12,824
So you have to really
have a sense

74
00:08:13,024 --> 00:08:16,893
of a sculptor to really
sculpt, to mold your body.

75
00:08:16,894 --> 00:08:19,530
The only difference is that
we in bodybuilding

76
00:08:19,531 --> 00:08:22,866
use a certain machine
to train the front deltoid,

77
00:08:22,867 --> 00:08:25,068
if it's missing, or a certain
machines to train

78
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:27,604
the serratus
or the intercostals,

79
00:08:27,605 --> 00:08:31,174
and an artist or a sculptor
uses a chisel and a hammer.

80
00:08:31,175 --> 00:08:34,579
But it's all about what
is your vision about

81
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,947
the way you should look like
as a finished product

82
00:08:36,948 --> 00:08:38,648
and how do you get it there.

83
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:43,553
You're trying to take your body
and sculpt it to where

84
00:08:43,554 --> 00:08:45,822
everything is in proportion,

85
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:50,293
everything from right side
to the left side is equal,

86
00:08:50,294 --> 00:08:51,796
and just being
a true work of art.

87
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:53,297
I think the main
motivation for me

88
00:08:53,298 --> 00:08:56,701
with this whole bodybuilding
experience is knowing

89
00:08:56,702 --> 00:09:00,137
that there's not such thing
as "the perfect body."

90
00:09:00,138 --> 00:09:02,172
But I'm gonna chase it
as hard as I can.

91
00:09:02,173 --> 00:09:06,844
Joe Weider was really
the father of fitness.

92
00:09:06,845 --> 00:09:11,215
He created the Mr. Olympia
contest, and created

93
00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:13,683
the International Federation
of Bodybuilders,

94
00:09:13,684 --> 00:09:18,055
and the Mr. Olympia became
the Super Bowl of bodybuilding.

95
00:09:18,056 --> 00:09:20,124
What does it mean to be
Mr. Olympia?

96
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,826
It means to be
the best of the best.

97
00:09:22,827 --> 00:09:24,577
A great champion
is a lot of things.

98
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,130
You have to be a role model
to a lot of people.

99
00:09:27,131 --> 00:09:30,667
You have to carry yourself
as a professional all the time.

100
00:09:30,668 --> 00:09:33,303
You have to go in and have
to train at 100 percent.

101
00:09:33,304 --> 00:09:35,739
You have to go to bed every
night and say,

102
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,908
"Am I fulfilling the task
of being the best at what I do?"

103
00:09:38,909 --> 00:09:42,979
Like in any sport, you can win
it and relax a little bit,

104
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,715
or you can win it
and stay hungry.

105
00:09:44,716 --> 00:09:48,185
Do you really want to, you know,
win it more that once?

106
00:09:48,186 --> 00:09:49,954
But there's never a guarantee.

107
00:09:49,955 --> 00:09:54,624
It comes down to the mind,
the will, the determination,

108
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,627
the discipline
and the motivation.

109
00:09:56,628 --> 00:10:00,730
And you have that fierce drive
that nothing's gonna stop you.

110
00:10:00,731 --> 00:10:01,800
That's what makes
you a champion.

111
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,835
When you are a champion, you never think
you're gonna lose.

112
00:10:04,836 --> 00:10:06,704
This is you life,
and this is your job.

113
00:10:06,705 --> 00:10:08,672
This is your number-one
responsibility,

114
00:10:08,673 --> 00:10:10,740
your number-one priority
in life.

115
00:10:10,741 --> 00:10:13,778
All you gotta do is continue
to do what you done before.

116
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:14,879
Let them follow you.

117
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,312
You don't have to follow them.

118
00:10:16,313 --> 00:10:19,917
So, if I try to change up my
training system...

119
00:10:19,918 --> 00:10:20,919
Why?

120
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:22,853
Why would I change?

121
00:10:22,854 --> 00:10:24,254
I am who I am.

122
00:10:24,255 --> 00:10:25,922
They are who they are.

123
00:10:25,923 --> 00:10:28,225
They may try to change
to do what I'm doing,

124
00:10:28,226 --> 00:10:30,293
because I have proven
that it worked.

125
00:10:30,294 --> 00:10:32,797
I'm the leader, I'm the man.

126
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:37,268
Not you, me, and it's okay,
because I look good.

127
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:42,806
I think that Phil has the look,
the physique, the mindset.

128
00:10:42,807 --> 00:10:46,911
I think he has the fire
in the belly to be a champion,

129
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:49,946
which is something he wants to
do for the next several years.

130
00:10:49,947 --> 00:10:51,782
So I think we'll have
the next Ronnie Coleman.

131
00:10:51,783 --> 00:10:54,752
Phil Heath, also known
as "The Gift,"

132
00:10:54,753 --> 00:10:56,954
is the image of confidence.

133
00:10:56,955 --> 00:10:59,389
The Olympia competition
is still weeks away.

134
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:02,058
Some of his contenders
have yet to qualify,

135
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:04,260
yet he has no qualms
about having a suit tailored

136
00:11:04,261 --> 00:11:05,995
for his victory.

137
00:11:05,996 --> 00:11:08,699
I'm not gonna lie,
I mean, I kinda like knowing

138
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,067
that when I win,

139
00:11:11,068 --> 00:11:15,038
not only I outshine them on
stage, but then off stage.

140
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:20,076
Because I know
that I'm covering every angle

141
00:11:20,077 --> 00:11:21,811
to be better than them.

142
00:11:21,812 --> 00:11:23,748
If I go out on the town
with the missus,

143
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:25,181
or if I'm going out
with the guys,

144
00:11:25,182 --> 00:11:27,951
I'm wearing button-downs, you know,
I'm wearin' the same stuff,

145
00:11:27,952 --> 00:11:30,220
the guy would be like,
"How did you fit in that?"

146
00:11:30,221 --> 00:11:31,955
I say,
"Well I got a tailor, bro."

147
00:11:31,956 --> 00:11:35,395
There're always contenders
waiting to rise.

148
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,830
Waiting for the perfect moment

149
00:11:39,831 --> 00:11:44,003
to take advantage
of a misstep...

150
00:11:45,003 --> 00:11:47,904
an unseen weakness.

151
00:11:47,905 --> 00:11:53,409
This is Kai Greene, his nemesis,
his enemy, studying every pose.

152
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:55,714
He has 11 weeks to prepare.

153
00:12:27,445 --> 00:12:31,749
For me, winning the Olympia
is a celebration

154
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:37,287
for a lot of people that
at least can share in the idea

155
00:12:37,288 --> 00:12:39,156
that well, you know,
maybe I wasn't

156
00:12:39,157 --> 00:12:41,926
born with the best genetics,
or maybe I wasn't born

157
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:46,263
with the most
dashing good looks,

158
00:12:46,264 --> 00:12:49,166
but there's something to be said
for hard work.

159
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:53,237
So, you know, we can say,
"Keep your gifts."

160
00:12:53,238 --> 00:12:54,872
I work hard.

161
00:12:54,873 --> 00:12:57,240
I know how to work real hard.

162
00:12:57,241 --> 00:12:59,343
Even if I tear a bicep,

163
00:12:59,344 --> 00:13:01,378
I'm still gonna stay
on my discipline.

164
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:04,080
Look at me from every angle,
and you're not gonna see

165
00:13:04,081 --> 00:13:09,286
one piece of my body
that's undeveloped.

166
00:13:09,287 --> 00:13:13,489
I'm gonna develop symmetry,
conditioning,

167
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:17,862
and I am going to whup
the ass of anyone

168
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:19,529
that stands there believing that

169
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:22,465
all it takes is genetics.

170
00:13:22,466 --> 00:13:25,436
Hard work beats
talent all the time.

171
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:26,936
Well, that's what he's thinking.

172
00:13:26,937 --> 00:13:30,107
He thinks that hard work
is gonna beat talent.

173
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:35,912
When talent
actually works hard, it's over.

174
00:13:35,913 --> 00:13:38,349
There's nothing that that other
person can do about it.

175
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,817
That confidence has lead Phil
to achieve a greatness

176
00:13:40,818 --> 00:13:42,385
few can dream of.

177
00:13:42,386 --> 00:13:44,254
But pride and arrogance
have been the downfall

178
00:13:44,255 --> 00:13:46,990
of many great men.

179
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:49,292
Kai never had a family.

180
00:13:49,293 --> 00:13:52,396
His mother abandoned him
when he was a teenager.

181
00:13:52,397 --> 00:13:54,130
And from that point on,
he was raised

182
00:13:54,131 --> 00:13:58,402
by various foster parents,
moving from home to home.

183
00:13:58,403 --> 00:14:02,239
Kai grew angry
and aggressive over time.

184
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,845
Before long, he found himself
in a juvenile detention facility.

185
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:12,148
His story would have ended there
if he hadn't discovered bodybuilding.

186
00:14:12,149 --> 00:14:16,320
The feelings of being unsafe,
feeling unsafe,

187
00:14:16,321 --> 00:14:18,888
constantly under threat.

188
00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:22,393
I remember I was in the process
of being restrained while fighting,

189
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,194
my shirt had gotten torn

190
00:14:24,195 --> 00:14:26,430
in the midst
of the whole demonstration,

191
00:14:26,431 --> 00:14:28,398
I'm taking the rest of the shirt
and throwin' it off.

192
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,234
"Fuck that, what?"

193
00:14:30,235 --> 00:14:34,037
You know, you go through this
whole display of "I'm powerful,

194
00:14:34,038 --> 00:14:36,606
I'm angry, I don't care!"

195
00:14:36,607 --> 00:14:40,911
You do this thing, and it was
some time after that

196
00:14:40,912 --> 00:14:45,148
the teacher, I had bumped
into him again maybe

197
00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:48,118
a week or so,
back in population.

198
00:14:48,119 --> 00:14:50,955
He had said, "Hey, you know,
you got a physique on you!

199
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:53,056
How you'd like
to think about competing

200
00:14:53,057 --> 00:14:55,658
against teenagers your own age?"

201
00:14:55,659 --> 00:14:57,360
I thought it was a joke.

202
00:14:57,361 --> 00:15:00,229
Back then, I never even used
to think that I would

203
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,532
probably ever even
get out of being

204
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:04,401
in institutional placement.

205
00:15:04,402 --> 00:15:09,072
It's a lot easier for me to have
been identified as an animal.

206
00:15:09,073 --> 00:15:12,609
Going to the gym and training,
it was probably

207
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:17,681
the single most important
therapeutic choice

208
00:15:17,682 --> 00:15:19,950
I could make on my own.

209
00:15:19,951 --> 00:15:24,922
And the people that were in my
life have long since moved on.

210
00:15:24,923 --> 00:15:27,358
The one thing that's remained
consistent is still, you know,

211
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:30,198
your focus towards achieving
this ultimate goal.

212
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:35,499
Texas.

213
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,267
Wide plains.

214
00:15:37,268 --> 00:15:40,170
Open spaces.

215
00:15:40,171 --> 00:15:43,974
Scorching heat.

216
00:15:43,975 --> 00:15:45,475
Branch Warren leads
a simple life

217
00:15:45,476 --> 00:15:48,948
away from the hustle and bustle
of the city.

218
00:15:53,335 --> 00:15:56,085
I tore my quadriceps tendon,
and it completely detached.

219
00:15:56,086 --> 00:15:57,488
No one's ever come
back from injury,

220
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:59,322
you know, that injury,
especially that fast.

221
00:15:59,323 --> 00:16:00,957
Most people,
it ends their career.

222
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,258
I did it in six months.

223
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:03,859
And that was an accident, right?

224
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,231
I was walking
in the parking lot...

225
00:16:08,232 --> 00:16:09,633
in a thunderstorm.

226
00:16:09,634 --> 00:16:12,302
And...

227
00:16:12,303 --> 00:16:13,303
I slipped and fell.

228
00:16:14,004 --> 00:16:16,105
So, you never know
what kind of curve ball

229
00:16:16,106 --> 00:16:17,975
life's gonna throw
at you, right?

230
00:16:17,976 --> 00:16:19,810
Some people cry and bitch
about it like little girls,

231
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,711
you know, and be babies
about it.

232
00:16:21,712 --> 00:16:23,413
A man, he has issues.

233
00:16:23,414 --> 00:16:25,382
He sets it aside,
he focuses on what he...

234
00:16:25,383 --> 00:16:27,183
what his job is
and gets it done.

235
00:16:27,184 --> 00:16:28,585
I put my faith in God.

236
00:16:28,586 --> 00:16:30,487
You know, I learned
from a very young age

237
00:16:30,488 --> 00:16:32,288
that no one owes you anything,

238
00:16:32,289 --> 00:16:34,391
and there ain't nobody
gonna give you a damn thing.

239
00:16:34,392 --> 00:16:36,093
But you can have anything
you want

240
00:16:36,094 --> 00:16:37,644
if you work hard enough for it.

241
00:16:41,265 --> 00:16:42,767
What's up?

242
00:16:46,304 --> 00:16:48,172
Gotta take care
of business in the gym.

243
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,407
You're with the boys,
so you gotta do what you gotta do.

244
00:16:50,408 --> 00:16:53,278
And when you come home,
you don't bring that home to your family.

245
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:00,283
Metroflex Gym.

246
00:17:00,284 --> 00:17:02,452
Built inside an old warehouse.

247
00:17:02,453 --> 00:17:05,721
Produced many of Texas'
greatest bodybuilders,

248
00:17:05,722 --> 00:17:07,624
including the great
Ronnie Coleman,

249
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:10,227
eight-time Mr. Olympia.

250
00:17:10,228 --> 00:17:12,678
Now it serves as a training
camp for Branch Warren

251
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,566
and his training partner,
Johnnie Jackson.

252
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:16,767
Yeah, baby!

253
00:17:16,768 --> 00:17:18,038
One more, go!

254
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:22,538
Yeah!

255
00:17:22,539 --> 00:17:24,142
Come on, get some.

256
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,077
Nobody beats you.

257
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:29,180
Huh?

258
00:17:31,382 --> 00:17:33,217
I grew up in that gym.

259
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:36,554
I mean, from learning how to fight, to learn
how to train, to learn how to be a man.

260
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:46,697
I don't think there's one bodybuilder
on this planet that's competed...

261
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:49,766
or even dreamed of competing
that hasn't dreamed of being Mr. Olympia.

262
00:17:49,767 --> 00:17:52,536
For 20 years, man, I go to bed at night
thinkin' about it, and I wake up

263
00:17:52,537 --> 00:17:53,836
in the morning
thinkin' about it.

264
00:17:53,837 --> 00:17:55,338
I think about it when I train.

265
00:17:55,339 --> 00:17:58,142
I've accomplished everything in this sport
I set out to accomplish.

266
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:00,577
I've got one contest
left to win.

267
00:18:08,085 --> 00:18:10,453
I'll eat dirt if I have
to eat dirt to win this, so...

268
00:18:10,454 --> 00:18:12,122
I don't care.

269
00:18:12,123 --> 00:18:14,324
You know, you're goin'
against the 15-20

270
00:18:14,325 --> 00:18:15,726
best bodybuilders on the planet.

271
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:17,227
We all wanna win.

272
00:18:17,228 --> 00:18:18,761
And I'm doing everything
in my power

273
00:18:18,762 --> 00:18:20,464
to make sure I win.

274
00:18:25,236 --> 00:18:28,305
Get out, move.

275
00:18:28,306 --> 00:18:31,174
Out of my face.

276
00:18:31,175 --> 00:18:32,410
Let's go.

277
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,749
Branch is one of those guys
who just,

278
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,450
I've never seen him do
anything right,

279
00:18:40,451 --> 00:18:42,818
or efficiently, he just works
hard at everything.

280
00:18:42,819 --> 00:18:44,219
You look at him train, you're like,

281
00:18:44,265 --> 00:18:46,222
"Man, I don't know how you
still have any joints left."

282
00:18:46,223 --> 00:18:47,857
And that's why
it's easy to pick on him.

283
00:18:47,858 --> 00:18:49,625
There's just no intelligence.

284
00:18:49,626 --> 00:18:52,796
There's no, like, it's pure work ethic, man,
which is great.

285
00:18:52,797 --> 00:18:55,798
And that's probably nine
of the top 10s of guys in the IFBB,

286
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:57,834
is they're doing the same crap,
day in, day out,

287
00:18:57,835 --> 00:18:59,303
year in, year out,
not gettin' any better,

288
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,672
but then they think the result
is gonna be better.

289
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:04,141
Well, news flash for ya,
it's not gonna happen.

290
00:19:04,142 --> 00:19:06,309
Take a smarter approach,
take a different approach,

291
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,612
you know, get better at it,
which is why I need...

292
00:19:08,812 --> 00:19:11,210
if I wanna compete with these
guys and beat these guys,

293
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:14,651
I need to take the most precise,
educated, scientific approach possible.

294
00:19:14,652 --> 00:19:16,252
The great thing about
this machine

295
00:19:16,253 --> 00:19:18,654
it's gonna give us,
you know, any ounce

296
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:22,726
of fat that he loses, any ounce of muscle
that he gains, it's gonna track it.

297
00:19:22,727 --> 00:19:25,394
It's extremely sensitive.

298
00:19:25,395 --> 00:19:27,730
Ben's faith in his scientific
approach to bodybuilding

299
00:19:27,731 --> 00:19:30,233
is complete and unquestioning.

300
00:19:30,234 --> 00:19:32,335
He has no shame in comparing
the failure

301
00:19:32,336 --> 00:19:34,805
of his opponents'
training philosophies

302
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:36,472
to the efficiency of his own.

303
00:19:36,473 --> 00:19:40,410
You ask him to push himself to a certain
level, and he finds a way to push past that.

304
00:19:40,411 --> 00:19:42,546
And we're tryin' to kill
him in the gym,

305
00:19:42,547 --> 00:19:44,914
you know, we're really trying
to push him mentally.

306
00:19:44,915 --> 00:19:46,350
That's perfect.

307
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,683
That's perfect, right there.

308
00:19:47,684 --> 00:19:48,919
Squeeze harder.

309
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,720
That's it, squeeze harder.

310
00:19:50,721 --> 00:19:52,256
That's it, perfect!

311
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:53,957
That's exactly what
we want, man.

312
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,626
That... those last three,
four reps,

313
00:19:56,627 --> 00:19:58,761
you were activating maximal
amount of muscle.

314
00:19:58,762 --> 00:20:00,663
That's exactly what
we need for growth.

315
00:20:00,664 --> 00:20:02,699
Bodybuilding is the most
fascinating sport

316
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,233
there is in the world.

317
00:20:04,234 --> 00:20:07,470
And in fact, this whole laboratory is
dedicated to studying bodybuilding.

318
00:20:07,471 --> 00:20:09,206
Even NFL linemen, they get big.

319
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:10,740
And they get a lot of muscle.

320
00:20:10,741 --> 00:20:14,577
But how in the world
can you get massive

321
00:20:14,578 --> 00:20:16,846
and get shredded
at the same time?

322
00:20:16,847 --> 00:20:18,882
This is completely
counterintuitive

323
00:20:18,883 --> 00:20:20,350
to even science.

324
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,251
So, to study how do you do that

325
00:20:22,252 --> 00:20:23,754
is phenomenal.

326
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:25,721
I remember it clear as day,
Flex Magazine,

327
00:20:25,722 --> 00:20:27,958
I was 15 years old
at the YMCA in Toronto.

328
00:20:27,959 --> 00:20:30,460
And the guy sitting
at the front desk brought one in.

329
00:20:30,461 --> 00:20:33,930
I looked at the cover of it, and I was like,
"Man, that's disgusting, that's gross.

330
00:20:33,931 --> 00:20:35,766
Man, I never wanna look
like that."

331
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:37,800
For me, it was more
along the lines of,

332
00:20:37,801 --> 00:20:39,635
well, I achieved my goal,
now, what's next?

333
00:20:39,636 --> 00:20:40,970
And I achieved my goal,
and what's next?

334
00:20:40,971 --> 00:20:43,272
So, first I wanna be
190 pounds with abs.

335
00:20:43,273 --> 00:20:44,307
Did it.

336
00:20:44,308 --> 00:20:46,309
Wanna be 210 with abs, did it.

337
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,844
And I just keep pushin',
and pushin', and pushin' it.

338
00:20:47,845 --> 00:20:50,846
I guess I was just never content,
never happy with my body.

339
00:20:50,847 --> 00:20:53,249
That's really, you know,
where it started for me.

340
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,251
Myself as a bodybuilder,
should be someone

341
00:20:55,252 --> 00:20:57,754
constantly striving to be one
percent better every day,

342
00:20:57,755 --> 00:21:01,725
you know, whether it be in your workouts,
in your approach to life,

343
00:21:01,726 --> 00:21:03,927
in your mentality,
in your nutrition,

344
00:21:03,928 --> 00:21:06,363
how meticulous you are
with nutrition.

345
00:21:06,364 --> 00:21:08,431
Just being better and better.

346
00:21:08,432 --> 00:21:10,866
Pushing your... every aspect
of your life.

347
00:21:10,867 --> 00:21:13,636
Like, I've always known that Mr. Olympia
was something I could do.

348
00:21:13,637 --> 00:21:17,807
If I want it, and I set my mind to it,
there's nothing that can stand in my way.

349
00:21:17,808 --> 00:21:19,041
There you go, man, no pain.

350
00:21:19,042 --> 00:21:21,411
- Come on, hit it, there you go!
- Drive it!

351
00:21:21,412 --> 00:21:24,448
You think this is fancy,
let's go, hurry up!

352
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,350
Man, there's always somebody
trying to reinvent the wheel.

353
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:27,918
I don't care what kind
of scientific formulas,

354
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,287
or whatever it is you come
up with, or nutrition

355
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:31,721
or whatever.

356
00:21:31,722 --> 00:21:33,757
There's no substitute
for hard, hard work.

357
00:21:33,758 --> 00:21:36,593
And the pain
and the sacrifice, the sweat,

358
00:21:36,594 --> 00:21:39,528
all the hard work, man,
when they announce you winner,

359
00:21:39,529 --> 00:21:40,998
it's all worth it.

360
00:21:46,804 --> 00:21:50,606
Heavy clouds loom
over Tampa, Florida.

361
00:21:50,607 --> 00:21:52,843
Roelly Winklaar arrives
from Rotterdam, Holland,

362
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:55,746
with his trainer, Sibil Peeters.

363
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:58,614
In the industry,
she's known as Grandma.

364
00:21:58,615 --> 00:22:01,752
But those who've trained with her know her
as the trainer from hell.

365
00:22:23,607 --> 00:22:25,343
Ah, rattlesnakes.

366
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,987
I like snakes because
I like how they

367
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:38,854
eat the food, you know?

368
00:22:38,855 --> 00:22:40,123
Kill them.

369
00:22:40,124 --> 00:22:43,860
And then you eat them, you know?

370
00:22:43,861 --> 00:22:46,896
The body's like this and they
eat like this, you know?

371
00:22:46,897 --> 00:22:48,698
That's the way I like it.

372
00:22:48,699 --> 00:22:50,499
They ask, "Where do
you come from?"

373
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,402
And I say, Curaçao.

374
00:22:52,403 --> 00:22:54,738
In the face, you can see that

375
00:22:54,739 --> 00:22:57,039
they don't know
where it is, you know?

376
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,375
And I say, the Caribbean.

377
00:22:59,376 --> 00:23:01,711
Then everybody know
the Caribbean.

378
00:23:04,147 --> 00:23:07,616
The two always share
a bedroom during their travels,

379
00:23:07,617 --> 00:23:12,157
the mobile kitchen and key ingredients
traveling along with them everywhere they go.

380
00:23:14,157 --> 00:23:17,594
Sibil herself used to be
a professional bodybuilder.

381
00:23:17,595 --> 00:23:19,429
Put the fish on it.

382
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:21,664
But after the tragic
death of her husband,

383
00:23:21,665 --> 00:23:25,434
she dedicated her life
to training others.

384
00:23:25,435 --> 00:23:27,170
Grandma, is my food finished?

385
00:23:27,171 --> 00:23:29,007
Is my food finished?

386
00:23:30,007 --> 00:23:31,807
Your food is finished.

387
00:23:31,808 --> 00:23:33,844
In the Netherlands,
I trained like a week

388
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:35,912
with the guys.

389
00:23:35,913 --> 00:23:38,481
My body grows fast, you know?

390
00:23:38,482 --> 00:23:41,050
The owner asked me
if I want to do a contest...

391
00:23:41,051 --> 00:23:45,623
I say, "No, I don't want to do that because
I don't like the string in your ass!

392
00:23:47,557 --> 00:23:49,558
It's not my style.

393
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:52,461
And he says, "It's not string in your ass.

394
00:23:52,462 --> 00:23:54,262
The name is posing trunks,
you know?"

395
00:23:55,031 --> 00:23:57,500
I say, "No, I don't like it."

396
00:23:57,501 --> 00:23:59,736
And he says, "I got one
option for you.

397
00:23:59,737 --> 00:24:02,706
You go on stage, and you win,

398
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:05,909
you can train for nothing, and I'll give you
food and supplements."

399
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,877
I say, "But, I got one problem.

400
00:24:07,878 --> 00:24:10,212
I got nobody, you know?"

401
00:24:10,213 --> 00:24:14,183
Everybody told me to go
to that woman over there.

402
00:24:14,184 --> 00:24:15,485
Grandma.

403
00:24:15,486 --> 00:24:16,585
I say "Grandma?

404
00:24:16,586 --> 00:24:17,953
Are you crazy, man?

405
00:24:17,954 --> 00:24:21,091
Don't let me train
with a woman, man!"

406
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:22,758
"Really, she's good, she's good

407
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:26,462
"She's one of the best,
you know?"

408
00:24:26,463 --> 00:24:29,199
I give her hand, but I say,

409
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,567
"Wow, you're a trainer?"

410
00:24:31,568 --> 00:24:33,236
I say, "Hey come on, you can
talk to me

411
00:24:33,237 --> 00:24:34,904
straight away, come on."

412
00:24:34,905 --> 00:24:39,608
And then, I find out
that he was very, very shy.

413
00:24:39,609 --> 00:24:45,481
In Holland, there
was an ugly word for him.

414
00:24:45,482 --> 00:24:48,819
"Look out, he's lazy.
Lazy negro."

415
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:50,186
I say, "Come on, guys!"

416
00:24:55,893 --> 00:24:58,728
I trained with him,
he's not lazy, the guy is...

417
00:24:58,729 --> 00:25:00,564
Go, go, go, go!

418
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:02,097
He's like a machine.

419
00:25:02,098 --> 00:25:05,235
In the gym, he's a machine,
nobody can stop him.

420
00:25:05,236 --> 00:25:08,270
He is "The Beast."

421
00:25:08,271 --> 00:25:11,975
My dream is to make a house
for my mother.

422
00:25:11,976 --> 00:25:15,545
Before my father died,
my father wanted to buy

423
00:25:15,546 --> 00:25:17,514
a big house for her.

424
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:20,616
But that's not happened.

425
00:25:20,617 --> 00:25:24,520
What my father promised her,
I make her.

426
00:25:24,521 --> 00:25:27,757
Tomorrow, in accordance
with the IFBB point system,

427
00:25:27,758 --> 00:25:29,358
Roelly must place
first or second

428
00:25:30,027 --> 00:25:33,662
in order to qualify
for the Olympia stage.

429
00:25:33,663 --> 00:25:35,230
So Winklaar...

430
00:25:35,231 --> 00:25:36,600
Are you nervous
for the competition?

431
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:37,601
No.

432
00:25:38,001 --> 00:25:39,970
You're always nervous
before a contest.

433
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:43,172
It has to be you're nervous,
otherwise on stage, you're...

434
00:25:43,173 --> 00:25:45,208
No, I'm not nervous because...

435
00:25:45,209 --> 00:25:47,277
I know I'm gonna win, you know?

436
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:48,612
Okay.

437
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:50,814
Put down the telephone.

438
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:52,214
You want to put it down?

439
00:25:52,215 --> 00:25:53,182
Put it down.

440
00:25:53,183 --> 00:25:54,249
You sure?

441
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:55,986
Come on, we have to go to sleep!

442
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:59,574
For a long time,
I have been tired, OK?

443
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:19,308
Hidetada Yamagishi
has also yet to qualify.

444
00:26:19,309 --> 00:26:20,743
Hide must place in the top two

445
00:26:20,744 --> 00:26:22,144
in order to advance.

446
00:26:22,145 --> 00:26:24,980
If he didn't have a tan,
you wouldn't see his definition on stage,

447
00:26:24,981 --> 00:26:28,884
you wouldn't see his striations,
his vascularity, anything.

448
00:26:28,885 --> 00:26:31,121
He would just wash out
under the bright lights.

449
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:33,690
You really gotta be dark
when you get on that stage.

450
00:26:33,691 --> 00:26:35,357
When the guys have
to go on stage,

451
00:26:35,358 --> 00:26:39,295
and they go white on stage,

452
00:26:39,296 --> 00:26:42,031
their muscles look small.

453
00:26:42,032 --> 00:26:45,235
When you're painting up, you can see

454
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:48,171
the muscles look very,
very good.

455
00:26:48,172 --> 00:26:49,644
Ok, bend over

456
00:26:54,644 --> 00:26:58,281
When we are finished,
we are all brown.

457
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,750
Seven.

458
00:27:34,751 --> 00:27:36,685
I got nine, Jason.

459
00:27:36,686 --> 00:27:39,055
Ten, Todd's here.

460
00:27:39,056 --> 00:27:41,725
I got 11, I got 12, I got 13.

461
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:44,827
I got 14, I got 15.

462
00:27:44,828 --> 00:27:47,067
I'm missing 16, Shawn?

463
00:27:50,767 --> 00:27:52,302
The bodybuilder
takes the human form

464
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:56,306
to its utmost visual extreme.

465
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:59,374
The development of muscles isn't
just a game of measurements.

466
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:01,979
Perfect symmetry
is equally important.

467
00:28:04,848 --> 00:28:06,982
♪ I've been up, hit the ground ♪

468
00:28:06,983 --> 00:28:09,318
♪ Chased the dirt,

00:28:36,413 --> 00:28:40,116

481

Please take
the fourth-place award.

482
00:29:09,445 --> 00:29:12,816
The check for $1,000...

483
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:14,883
to our fourth-place finisher.

484
00:29:14,884 --> 00:29:17,054
Roelly Winklaar!

485
00:29:26,063 --> 00:29:29,535
The road to success isn't always
straight or clear in this sport.

486
00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:33,803
Another loss like Tampa would
mean months and years

487
00:29:34,003 --> 00:29:35,772
of training have been wasted.

488
00:29:39,242 --> 00:29:41,810
This means the loss of prize
money and perhaps even

489
00:29:41,811 --> 00:29:46,115
a sponsor, the support line
for any bodybuilder.

490
00:30:05,536 --> 00:30:09,204
Lonely nights,
familiar hotel rooms,

491
00:30:09,205 --> 00:30:11,406
long-distance calls are the only
way to keep in touch

492
00:30:11,407 --> 00:30:12,809
with loved ones.

493
00:30:16,313 --> 00:30:19,082
At times when
the family can't be reached,

494
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:22,051
the trainer is the only person
to talk to.

495
00:30:24,221 --> 00:30:26,456
Hey, bro, congratulations!

496
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:29,325
Second place,
and Olympia qualification.

497
00:30:29,326 --> 00:30:33,328
I'm happy,
and I'm relieved, you know?

498
00:30:33,329 --> 00:30:35,131
Yeah, me too.

499
00:30:35,132 --> 00:30:37,834
I knew you were gonna do it,
but now it's official.

500
00:30:37,835 --> 00:30:39,868
So, we got six weeks
to train hard.

501
00:30:39,869 --> 00:30:42,104
Alright.

502
00:30:42,105 --> 00:30:45,174
Okay, bro, keep in touch,
and thanks for calling.

503
00:30:49,145 --> 00:30:52,047
Roelly has trouble
sleeping most nights.

504
00:30:52,048 --> 00:30:55,317
Moments ago, he was told that he has
one more chance to qualify,

505
00:30:55,318 --> 00:30:58,320
but he'll have to travel back to
Europe to compete at the Nordic Pro.

506
00:30:58,321 --> 00:30:59,922
Winklaar.

507
00:30:59,923 --> 00:31:01,591
You OK?

508
00:31:01,592 --> 00:31:03,192
Yeah, Grandma.

509
00:31:11,868 --> 00:31:13,603
It's time for your food.

510
00:31:13,604 --> 00:31:14,604
Yes.

511
00:31:17,091 --> 00:31:19,241
Unless he places first,
his journey will end

512
00:31:19,242 --> 00:31:21,414
before it begins.

513
00:31:30,453 --> 00:31:32,654
Victor Martinez
wasn't always an inmate.

514
00:31:32,655 --> 00:31:34,524
He was a star,

515
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:39,162
a star bodybuilder on his way
to conquer the Olympia title.

516
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:43,266
He was incarcerated for an immigration charge
as a result of his arrest

517
00:31:43,267 --> 00:31:46,068
for a controlled
substance years ago.

518
00:31:46,069 --> 00:31:49,238
To actually be in jail
and want to live

519
00:31:49,239 --> 00:31:54,110
or think of outside,
it just makes it all difficult.

520
00:31:54,111 --> 00:31:56,278
I had to shut down,

521
00:31:56,279 --> 00:32:00,415
there's no making up,
it's lost time, that's it.

522
00:32:00,416 --> 00:32:04,120
I was disappearing.

523
00:32:04,121 --> 00:32:07,256
His stint in jail has left him
far behind his competitors.

524
00:32:07,257 --> 00:32:10,192
And mounting emotional and
financial problems won't make

525
00:32:10,193 --> 00:32:12,662
his return any easier.

526
00:32:12,663 --> 00:32:15,265
A six-month sentence
is a lifetime for a bodybuilder.

527
00:32:20,703 --> 00:32:26,541
You're at war right now,
with other competitors.

528
00:32:26,542 --> 00:32:28,610
And when you do what you have to
do from now to the Mr. Olympia,

529
00:32:28,611 --> 00:32:30,278
you do what you have
to do to win.

530
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:33,716
And as long as you know you did
what you had to do to win,

531
00:32:33,717 --> 00:32:37,021
nobody can ever say anything bad
about you ever, ever.

532
00:32:38,021 --> 00:32:41,056
Because you know in your heart,
you gave it your all.

533
00:32:41,057 --> 00:32:44,460
Coming back now,
preparing for the Olympia is...

534
00:32:44,461 --> 00:32:47,130
I don't have
that feeling like I'm ready.

535
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:49,664
I can't say I walked in and had
the best workout.

536
00:32:49,665 --> 00:32:53,502
The first time I went in,
it was horrible.

537
00:32:53,503 --> 00:32:57,306
I'm touching the weights,
and it's...

538
00:32:57,307 --> 00:33:00,610
there's no connection,
I didn't really eat in there,

539
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:03,445
Seven, 800 calories,
most of it was through bread

540
00:33:03,446 --> 00:33:09,117
and you know, junk food,
Snickers bars.

541
00:33:09,118 --> 00:33:13,122
I'd say right now,
every workout I do is important.

542
00:33:13,123 --> 00:33:16,225
Between meals and training,
between court-ordered appointments,

543
00:33:16,226 --> 00:33:18,594
between his separation
from his girlfriend,

544
00:33:18,595 --> 00:33:22,664
between all these things,
he tries to maintain his sanity.

545
00:33:22,665 --> 00:33:27,236
He tries to find time to be
a father to his four children.

546
00:33:27,237 --> 00:33:31,074
Two boys, which are autistic,
and two young girls,

547
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:34,043
all from different mothers

548
00:33:34,044 --> 00:33:37,246
I'm backed up on child support,
I still take care of my kids,

549
00:33:37,247 --> 00:33:41,217
but, they freeze
your bank account,

550
00:33:41,218 --> 00:33:43,719
they suspend your license
and yes, I'm driving

551
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,055
illegally right now.

552
00:33:46,056 --> 00:33:49,292
So what, what can you do,
you know?

553
00:33:57,233 --> 00:34:00,372
Let's warm up,
after this, we gotta pick it up.

554
00:34:02,372 --> 00:34:05,341
I'm not mentally ready, it's...

555
00:34:05,342 --> 00:34:08,743
it's bothersome
every single day.

556
00:34:08,744 --> 00:34:12,314
It's bothering because
I'm working on it every day,

557
00:34:12,315 --> 00:34:14,616
you know, preparing myself.

558
00:34:14,617 --> 00:34:15,685
Pick up your spirit, let's go.

559
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:17,386
Come on, man!

560
00:34:17,387 --> 00:34:19,188
We gotta do this.

561
00:34:22,391 --> 00:34:23,391
Come on!

562
00:34:27,563 --> 00:34:28,833
Great set.

563
00:34:30,533 --> 00:34:31,834
I can't keep going like this.

564
00:34:31,835 --> 00:34:35,805
I gotta try to pick it up, man.

565
00:34:35,806 --> 00:34:39,341
I'm playing with
the big boys, man.

566
00:34:39,342 --> 00:34:42,078
That's why we gotta push.

567
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,448
You'll get back there again.

568
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:47,216
Push it.

569
00:34:47,217 --> 00:34:48,217
That's it.

570
00:34:50,086 --> 00:34:52,555
Come on!

571
00:34:52,556 --> 00:34:53,556
You can do this.

572
00:34:58,161 --> 00:35:00,129
You're gonna do this, man.

573
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:03,131
You gotta stay focused.

574
00:35:03,132 --> 00:35:04,700
I mean...

575
00:35:04,701 --> 00:35:07,270
You want to be
on that stage again, right?

576
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,205
Yeah, of course.

577
00:35:09,206 --> 00:35:14,109
My entire life is the fricking
stock market, man!

578
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:17,181
Right now, I'm in a recession.

579
00:35:27,858 --> 00:35:32,160
Dennis Wolf wanders through
the halls of NBC networks.

580
00:35:32,161 --> 00:35:35,897
This is a dream come true for the bodybuilder
from Germany.

581
00:35:35,898 --> 00:35:38,701
A moment of classic
American celebrity,

582
00:35:38,702 --> 00:35:41,870
an interview on the nationalized
television show.

583
00:35:41,871 --> 00:35:43,439
This is his time,

584
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,308
his moment to grasp
a hold of fame.

585
00:35:46,309 --> 00:35:48,243
Welcome back
to "The Morning Blend."

586
00:35:48,244 --> 00:35:51,180
They're fit, they're strong,
but there can only be one!

587
00:35:51,181 --> 00:35:53,749
The world's top bodybuilders
are competing to bring home

588
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,750
the coveted title
of Mr. Olympia.

589
00:35:55,751 --> 00:35:57,620
I was a big fan
of Arnold Schwarzenegger,

590
00:35:57,621 --> 00:36:00,656
and bodybuilding,
I fell in love right away,

591
00:36:00,657 --> 00:36:03,859
when I walk out... you know,
walk in for the first time into the gym

592
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,828
and that was my thing.

593
00:36:05,829 --> 00:36:08,698
People are going to America
to have success,

594
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:11,500
the first six months
was hard because people are,

595
00:36:11,501 --> 00:36:14,337
"Oh, look at this guy,
he's probably just

596
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:17,239
lifting weights and that's it.

597
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,674
Dumb, stupid,"
because people have no idea

598
00:36:19,675 --> 00:36:21,246
what is bodybuilding.

599
00:36:23,246 --> 00:36:25,247
You need someone
who can push you,

600
00:36:25,248 --> 00:36:27,750
and it's not easy to find
someone who can push me,

601
00:36:27,751 --> 00:36:29,517
that's why I have Dennis.

602
00:36:29,518 --> 00:36:32,855
Your know, every time we train
together, he finish me.

603
00:36:32,856 --> 00:36:35,957
he's finishing me,
and, you know,

604
00:36:35,958 --> 00:36:38,361
I'm sore for days.

605
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:39,428
Come on, one more, come on!

606
00:36:39,429 --> 00:36:41,397
- Too big pump!
- Come on!

607
00:36:41,398 --> 00:36:44,366
That's what we're here for!

608
00:36:44,367 --> 00:36:46,968
We gonna pump the iron, come on!

609
00:36:46,969 --> 00:36:49,272
Slow, Dennis, slow, slow, slow.

610
00:36:49,273 --> 00:36:51,674
Slow!

611
00:36:51,675 --> 00:36:53,709
That's good and three...

612
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:56,312
Let's go!

613
00:36:56,313 --> 00:36:59,416
Hup, hup, hup!

614
00:37:11,827 --> 00:37:15,297
Stand up
and move around a little.

615
00:37:15,298 --> 00:37:17,448
You have to lose that one,
I'm really dizzy.

616
00:37:20,269 --> 00:37:21,719
Anybody ready to break dance?

617
00:37:27,844 --> 00:37:29,412
Almost drowned!

618
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:32,982
Germany, with its cold
and oppressive rain

619
00:37:32,983 --> 00:37:37,720
stands in stark contrast
to Vegas' glaring sunshine

620
00:37:37,721 --> 00:37:41,790
To him, America is the chance
to become one of the greats.

621
00:37:41,791 --> 00:37:43,692
To become an Arnold.

622
00:37:43,693 --> 00:37:46,462
To become a star.

623
00:37:46,463 --> 00:37:50,265
Wolf's stepdaughter
visits him as often as she can.

624
00:37:50,266 --> 00:37:52,935
Their relationship
is as strong as iron,

625
00:37:52,936 --> 00:37:54,803
despite the lack of blood ties.

626
00:37:54,804 --> 00:37:57,640
I saw him every day.

627
00:37:57,641 --> 00:38:00,308
It's... yeah.

628
00:38:00,309 --> 00:38:02,812
I didn't think he's big,
it's normal for me,

629
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:05,680
every day I saw him.

630
00:38:05,681 --> 00:38:08,551
Everybody should place
where they deserve.

631
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:10,486
It's hard when you have
so many judges and you have

632
00:38:10,487 --> 00:38:15,658
so many great athletes, where the standard
is so close, you could throw a coin.

633
00:38:15,659 --> 00:38:18,660
You know, apples or oranges,
what do you like?

634
00:38:18,661 --> 00:38:21,296
You know,
it is that close sometimes,

635
00:38:21,297 --> 00:38:23,966
"He was great, wow, wow, wow."

636
00:38:23,967 --> 00:38:25,567
How do you judge?

637
00:38:25,568 --> 00:38:27,403
He has a better smile,
he has green eyes,

638
00:38:27,404 --> 00:38:29,404
he has blue eyes,
he has brown eyes.

639
00:38:29,405 --> 00:38:31,439
You know what I mean...
it's hard, it's not easy.

640
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,477
Every muscle part
must be completely perfect.

641
00:38:35,478 --> 00:38:38,446
No weak points,
we get judged by weak points.

642
00:38:38,447 --> 00:38:41,517
If you don't have
the better symmetry,

643
00:38:41,518 --> 00:38:45,453
the better muscle maturity,
muscle quality,

644
00:38:45,454 --> 00:38:47,589
as Mr. Olympia, you don't win.

645
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:51,093
Do the double biceps.

646
00:38:51,094 --> 00:38:55,864
Try to open up,
pull up, pull up...

647
00:38:55,865 --> 00:38:58,670
And bend the wrists
back a little bit.

648
00:39:04,974 --> 00:39:07,343
"Oh, his hairstyle."

649
00:39:07,344 --> 00:39:08,843
He's gotta be gay,
there's something wrong.

650
00:39:08,844 --> 00:39:12,415
I just...
something's wrong with that guy,

651
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:14,716
he's just so different!

652
00:39:14,717 --> 00:39:16,451
You'll never be a champion.

653
00:39:16,452 --> 00:39:18,687
You might win a show but...

654
00:39:18,688 --> 00:39:21,056
you'll never be Mr. Olympia!"

655
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:28,096
While others will celebrate,
you know,

656
00:39:28,097 --> 00:39:33,803
achieving master's and Ph.D.s...

657
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:36,971
I won bodybuilding competitions.

658
00:39:36,972 --> 00:39:42,812
And now I stand here,
at the top of this experience,

659
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:45,948
looking at winning
the highest...

660
00:39:45,949 --> 00:39:48,851
title in the bodybuilding world.

661
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,421
Turn your wrist in,
pull it tight!

662
00:39:52,422 --> 00:39:54,723
Flex your hamstrings,
pull tight!

663
00:39:54,724 --> 00:39:57,593
Pull.

664
00:39:57,594 --> 00:39:58,761
Pull it.

665
00:39:58,762 --> 00:39:59,861
Pull it!

666
00:39:59,862 --> 00:40:01,529
Roll it over a little more, Kai.

667
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:03,031
There we go,
pop your hamstring out.

668
00:40:03,032 --> 00:40:05,600
Squeeze...
all the way down!

669
00:40:05,601 --> 00:40:07,970
Bring this up... pull tight,
hamstring up a little.

670
00:40:07,971 --> 00:40:10,471
Posing is a very valuable tool
to build a physique,

671
00:40:11,007 --> 00:40:13,975
to build a physique
that is historically

672
00:40:13,976 --> 00:40:16,412
the physique
that is bodybuilding.

673
00:40:16,413 --> 00:40:17,893
It's not just enough
to go to the gym,

674
00:40:18,014 --> 00:40:21,783
and just train,
and lift weights.

675
00:40:21,784 --> 00:40:24,520
There's an internal connection

676
00:40:24,521 --> 00:40:28,591
with the contractions
that your muscles make.

677
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:32,127
What I'm really talking about
is the presence of the artistic mind

678
00:40:32,128 --> 00:40:37,467
that ultimately
sculpts the physique.

679
00:40:39,368 --> 00:40:40,803
Lower your shoulders,
you're doing it wrong.

680
00:40:41,003 --> 00:40:42,606
Let's do it again.

681
00:40:43,606 --> 00:40:45,143
No, do it again.

682
00:40:47,143 --> 00:40:50,645
Suck it in...

683
00:40:50,646 --> 00:40:51,980
Legs, legs, legs.

684
00:40:51,981 --> 00:40:53,716
You're forgetting
about your legs.

685
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:57,953
People always tell me,
"Hey, he's looking tired.

686
00:40:57,954 --> 00:41:00,089
You let him do too much."

687
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:03,759
But he's always up late
on the internet,

688
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,127
coming in the gym
with a face like this.

689
00:41:06,128 --> 00:41:08,531
That makes me angry!

690
00:41:08,532 --> 00:41:11,966
It's not allowed... I respect you,
you have to respect me.

691
00:41:11,967 --> 00:41:14,770
Don't come with a face like this

692
00:41:14,771 --> 00:41:16,638
because you didn't sleep.

693
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:18,806
Go to your bed,
you have to rest.

694
00:41:18,807 --> 00:41:20,109
Let me know
when you're finished.

695
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,977
You need your energy
on the stage,

696
00:41:21,978 --> 00:41:25,180
when you don't have it on the stage,
you can lose everything.

697
00:41:25,181 --> 00:41:26,814
- I know.
- In the off-season,

698
00:41:26,815 --> 00:41:29,985
do what you want,
don't do it in the competition!

699
00:41:41,764 --> 00:41:43,665
- What's up, champ?
- Dennis James,

700
00:41:43,666 --> 00:41:45,067
a retired bodybuilder,
and mentor

701
00:41:45,068 --> 00:41:47,569
in the eyes of most athletes,

702
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:49,772
doesn't sugarcoat criticism.

703
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:52,274
From posing,
to diet, to training,

704
00:41:52,275 --> 00:41:55,643
his astute eye
can identify any problem.

705
00:41:55,644 --> 00:41:57,812
So this time you have to really,
really go out there,

706
00:41:57,813 --> 00:42:00,783
and you have to nail it...
and I talked to a judge

707
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:04,153
who said that you lose
two spots on his sheets

708
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:06,689
because of the way you pose,
you know what I mean?

709
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:07,957
So this is something
you can control.

710
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:09,524
You can work on that.

711
00:42:09,525 --> 00:42:10,959
- You can show him.
- Yeah, of course.

712
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,627
You're here, please help.

713
00:42:12,628 --> 00:42:14,596
Now pull it down,
like you do a lat pulldown,

714
00:42:14,597 --> 00:42:16,531
and now open up...
there you go.

715
00:42:16,532 --> 00:42:18,767
See, now he has
some movement going on.

716
00:42:18,768 --> 00:42:24,172
The judge told me this was not coming out,
and that's why.

717
00:42:24,173 --> 00:42:26,875
You know how you bring that out?
Just try this one time.

718
00:42:26,876 --> 00:42:30,014
Instead of going
right into something like this,

719
00:42:31,014 --> 00:42:37,185
try to go up, pull it down,
then open up, cause you create music.

720
00:42:37,186 --> 00:42:41,159
This is the again what I'm saying,
you move, eyes on you.

721
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:46,095
Always start from the bottom,
legs, hamstrings, glutes.

722
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:50,131
Now arms, all the way,
straight up.

723
00:42:50,132 --> 00:42:52,767
Just like... that's it,
just like that!

724
00:42:52,768 --> 00:42:55,303
That's what I want him to do,
see the difference?

725
00:42:55,304 --> 00:42:56,972
- You see that?
- Yeah.

726
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:18,160
Our third-place finalist,

727
00:43:18,161 --> 00:43:20,129
representing Germany,
number two,

728
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:23,232
Ronny Rockel.

729
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:25,968
Let's take
the first runner-up award

730
00:43:25,969 --> 00:43:28,005
and present that to...

731
00:43:29,005 --> 00:43:30,672
by way of Poland, number eight,

732
00:43:30,673 --> 00:43:33,108
Robert Piotrkowicz.

733
00:43:36,746 --> 00:43:38,312
The first-place prize,

734
00:43:38,313 --> 00:43:41,018
and moving on
to the Mr. Olympia contest...

735
00:43:42,018 --> 00:43:44,286
Roelly Winklaar!

736
00:43:54,197 --> 00:43:56,397
- Finally!
- Finally!

737
00:43:56,398 --> 00:43:58,366
Nice job!

738
00:43:58,367 --> 00:44:00,703
This what we worked so hard for!

739
00:44:00,704 --> 00:44:02,738
Hey, finally...

740
00:44:02,739 --> 00:44:05,107
Finally, we made it through.

741
00:44:05,108 --> 00:44:06,174
Yes, finally.

742
00:44:06,175 --> 00:44:07,776
We are...

743
00:44:07,777 --> 00:44:09,111
up to the...

744
00:44:09,112 --> 00:44:12,681
- Mr. O.
- O, nice!

745
00:44:22,891 --> 00:44:25,694
The Martinez family moved
to Washington Heights, NY,

746
00:44:25,695 --> 00:44:29,832
from the Dominican Republic
when Victor was six years old.

747
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,700
He grew up in a house
with seven sisters,

748
00:44:31,701 --> 00:44:34,937
two brothers,
an overbearing mother,

749
00:44:34,938 --> 00:44:37,772
and a strict,
unsupportive father.

750
00:44:37,773 --> 00:44:39,707
That lack of support
and understanding

751
00:44:39,708 --> 00:44:43,779
has plagued Victor's ambitions
his entire career.

752
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:45,913
Getting smaller, man!

753
00:44:45,914 --> 00:44:48,750
What's up...
you're not working out, man!

754
00:44:48,751 --> 00:44:50,384
Trying to,
I'm gonna get to the gym, man.

755
00:44:50,385 --> 00:44:52,087
Good, good, good.

756
00:44:52,088 --> 00:44:54,223
Get me a ticket or something,
I'll go!

757
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:57,793
Yeah, all right.

758
00:44:59,795 --> 00:45:04,399
In 2009, Victor's sister,
Iridania, was murdered.

759
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,701
Iridania always cooked
meals for Victor

760
00:45:06,702 --> 00:45:08,470
before his competitions.

761
00:45:08,471 --> 00:45:11,840
Her absence affects him
to this day.

762
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:15,810
You say "Daddy"?

763
00:45:15,811 --> 00:45:18,312
No...
So you want ice cream?

764
00:45:18,313 --> 00:45:19,915
No?

765
00:45:19,916 --> 00:45:21,950
I know you want...

766
00:45:21,951 --> 00:45:22,917
Oh!

767
00:45:22,918 --> 00:45:24,953
What was that kiss for?

768
00:45:24,954 --> 00:45:26,789
That was all for me?

769
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:31,493
Victor loves returning
to his old neighborhood,

770
00:45:31,494 --> 00:45:34,296
where everything seems
so familiar.

771
00:45:34,297 --> 00:45:38,232
Familiar faces, familiar places.

772
00:45:38,233 --> 00:45:41,803
This is a place he will always
call home in his heart,

773
00:45:41,804 --> 00:45:43,404
mostly because of his daughter,

774
00:45:43,405 --> 00:45:45,874
who still resides here
with her mother.

775
00:45:45,875 --> 00:45:47,810
Quitting has not been a choice,

776
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:51,078
only because I cannot see myself

777
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:53,281
explaining this to my kids.

778
00:45:53,282 --> 00:45:55,783
Right now,
I have to provide for my family.

779
00:45:55,784 --> 00:45:58,922
I need bodybuilding to survive.

780
00:46:16,539 --> 00:46:18,473
- Goddamn!
- All right, bro.

781
00:46:18,474 --> 00:46:19,624
How are you doin', bro?

782
00:46:20,009 --> 00:46:21,310
Fast!

783
00:46:21,311 --> 00:46:22,944
Killing yourself down here,
already?

784
00:46:22,945 --> 00:46:24,212
Yeah, I have to, man.

785
00:46:24,213 --> 00:46:26,351
- The only way to go, bro!
- No doubt!

786
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:30,151
I'm very proud of you,
you hear me?

787
00:46:30,152 --> 00:46:33,254
God bless you, bro!

788
00:46:33,255 --> 00:46:36,859
My judgment day
will be seeing Steve Weinberger.

789
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:39,194
Seeing the judge,
and him telling me

790
00:46:39,195 --> 00:46:43,065
if I'm ready
for the Olympia stage or not.

791
00:46:56,211 --> 00:46:58,046
Yeah, look at your hamstrings.

792
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:59,982
I'm telling you, Victor,

793
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:02,433
you have a lot of work to do
before you see Steve.

794
00:47:13,862 --> 00:47:15,430
Can I get two pounds?

795
00:47:15,431 --> 00:47:17,032
- Two pounds?
- Yes, sir.

796
00:47:20,436 --> 00:47:22,104
It's pretty intense.

797
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:23,504
It's always intense.

798
00:47:23,505 --> 00:47:27,542
Somebody may ask you,
"Is it that serious?"

799
00:47:27,543 --> 00:47:29,278
It's always that serious.

800
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:32,546
I'm a professional at what I do.

801
00:47:32,547 --> 00:47:34,582
I'm not a fan,
I'm not a spectator,

802
00:47:34,583 --> 00:47:38,085
I'm not the person at home,
I'm the man living this,

803
00:47:38,086 --> 00:47:40,187
if I don't eat like this,

804
00:47:40,188 --> 00:47:43,158
I don't make
conscious food choices

805
00:47:43,159 --> 00:47:47,161
when it's time to make them,
every day, all day,

806
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:51,399
then the goods won't be there
when I need them to be.

807
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,868
This is the easy part.

808
00:47:53,869 --> 00:47:57,305
If you can't do the easy stuff,

809
00:47:57,306 --> 00:47:59,942
then what do you do
when life happens?

810
00:47:59,943 --> 00:48:02,444
Things will come and test you.

811
00:48:02,445 --> 00:48:05,046
A loved one goes
to the hospital.

812
00:48:05,047 --> 00:48:07,016
It's abrupt.

813
00:48:08,016 --> 00:48:11,386
You feel obligated or compelled

814
00:48:11,387 --> 00:48:13,888
to want to be there.

815
00:48:13,889 --> 00:48:17,259
You still gotta be in the gym
at six o'clock in the morning.

816
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:18,827
You still gotta
start your meals,

817
00:48:19,027 --> 00:48:20,995
so for you to stay focused,

818
00:48:20,996 --> 00:48:24,232
it's not a sacrifice,
it has to be a lifestyle.

819
00:48:24,233 --> 00:48:25,634
When you're training for
the competition, it consumes

820
00:48:25,635 --> 00:48:27,535
your whole day...
bodybuilders, by definition,

821
00:48:27,536 --> 00:48:29,604
most of 'em will tell you are
very self-centered and selfish.

822
00:48:29,605 --> 00:48:32,441
Even if you're not that type of person,
you become that kind of person,

823
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:33,942
because you never
get away from it,

824
00:48:33,943 --> 00:48:36,410
because your nutrition,
when you dieting,

825
00:48:36,411 --> 00:48:38,312
for Mr. Olympia,
you can't eat out,

826
00:48:38,313 --> 00:48:40,147
because you have
to weigh your food,

827
00:48:40,148 --> 00:48:44,151
you have to have so many carbs,
so much protein, so much water...

828
00:48:44,152 --> 00:48:45,553
you have to control
what's in the food.

829
00:48:45,554 --> 00:48:48,622
- What you got?
- We got beef, chicken,

830
00:48:48,623 --> 00:48:51,326
turkey, beans,

831
00:48:51,327 --> 00:48:53,095
potato salad and coleslaw.

832
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:55,129
Like a bunch of marinade
and things on it?

833
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:56,430
Not it's just...

834
00:48:56,431 --> 00:48:57,601
salt.

835
00:48:58,601 --> 00:49:01,370
Cool, man.

836
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:03,721
Damn, ain't gonna be getting
none of that today.

837
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:07,642
You can eat seven, eight times
a day, like some people.

838
00:49:07,643 --> 00:49:09,812
I'm like, "Yeah, you gotta
eat a lot of clean food."

839
00:49:10,012 --> 00:49:11,645
And then the mom will say,
"Yeah, my son eats,

840
00:49:11,646 --> 00:49:14,950
he eats everything..."
yeah, he's eating everything.

841
00:49:14,951 --> 00:49:16,283
That's why he's not lean.

842
00:49:16,284 --> 00:49:17,718
Suppose to mix this in a drink,

843
00:49:17,719 --> 00:49:21,723
but goes down fine
just like this, so why not?

844
00:49:21,724 --> 00:49:25,660
Most other people, they go to the store,
they'll buy some product.

845
00:49:25,661 --> 00:49:27,395
They just...

846
00:49:27,396 --> 00:49:29,531
and hoping for the best.

847
00:49:29,532 --> 00:49:31,366
They don't know
how that actually works.

848
00:49:31,367 --> 00:49:34,301
They don't know the science
behind those supplements.

849
00:49:34,302 --> 00:49:36,138
They don't care,
and they're not supposed to,

850
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:39,473
I get that...
but, yeah, we're the dumb-dumbs.

851
00:49:39,474 --> 00:49:41,142
We're the people
that don't know anything,

852
00:49:41,143 --> 00:49:43,111
but just bein' a box of rocks
with weights,

853
00:49:43,112 --> 00:49:44,712
and all this other stuff,
we're the meatheads,

854
00:49:44,713 --> 00:49:46,381
we're the idiots...
we're able to do something

855
00:49:46,382 --> 00:49:49,651
that 99.8 percent of the people
on the Earth can do,

856
00:49:49,652 --> 00:49:53,023
which is lose fat and gain
muscle, at the same time.

857
00:49:54,023 --> 00:49:56,658
They don't know
that we eat seven, eight,

858
00:49:56,659 --> 00:49:59,361
nine thousand calories a day.

859
00:49:59,362 --> 00:50:04,198
They don't know that we're in the gym
two, three times a day, six days a week.

860
00:50:04,199 --> 00:50:08,335
Right away, they want
to just diminish your work.

861
00:50:08,336 --> 00:50:11,205
By going to that one
little thing and brush it off,

862
00:50:11,206 --> 00:50:14,077
they're saying, "You know what,
it's because they're taking steroids."

863
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:22,683
The overall perception
of steroids, obviously,

864
00:50:22,684 --> 00:50:26,754
is something that
cheaters only use.

865
00:50:26,755 --> 00:50:29,723
We are realizing now
that the truth of the matter

866
00:50:29,724 --> 00:50:33,727
is any athlete
at the professional

867
00:50:33,728 --> 00:50:36,665
or world-class level...

868
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:39,600
is likely using some form

869
00:50:39,601 --> 00:50:44,473
of performance-enhancing drugs.

870
00:50:44,474 --> 00:50:46,575
Anabolic steroids don't make

871
00:50:46,576 --> 00:50:50,111
what professional bodybuilders
do easier.

872
00:50:50,112 --> 00:50:53,747
It simply allows them to take it
to that extreme level.

873
00:50:53,748 --> 00:50:57,319
Anabolic steroids
are basically testosterone,

874
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,754
or testosterone derivatives.

875
00:50:59,755 --> 00:51:03,457
So in the body,
when you take a synthetic form,

876
00:51:03,458 --> 00:51:06,428
it basically gets into
the muscle cell,

877
00:51:06,429 --> 00:51:09,531
attaches to receptors
that are in that cell,

878
00:51:09,532 --> 00:51:13,567
and then that turns on genes
in the muscle cell

879
00:51:13,568 --> 00:51:15,169
that produce more protein.

880
00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:18,640
That's the way
it enhances muscle size.

881
00:51:18,641 --> 00:51:22,176
Many of the athletes simply
refuse to talk on the subject.

882
00:51:22,177 --> 00:51:23,645
It's taboo.

883
00:51:23,646 --> 00:51:26,214
Others are willing
to engage in the conversation.

884
00:51:26,215 --> 00:51:28,353
Because people...

885
00:51:30,353 --> 00:51:33,622
take too much of this stuff,

886
00:51:33,623 --> 00:51:36,091
and don't know how to use it,

887
00:51:36,092 --> 00:51:38,426
that gives bodybuilding
a bad, bad name.

888
00:51:38,427 --> 00:51:42,397
The media likes to portray it
as being very sensational

889
00:51:42,398 --> 00:51:45,600
but steroids aren't addictive,
steroids never killed anybody.

890
00:51:45,601 --> 00:51:47,801
There's no physiological proof,
it's never been shown,

891
00:51:47,802 --> 00:51:49,738
it's all what the media
wants you to see.

892
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:51,473
Society's reaction to steroids

893
00:51:51,474 --> 00:51:54,341
is often hypocritical
and judgmental.

894
00:51:54,342 --> 00:51:56,210
I think it's a contradiction,
to be honest,

895
00:51:56,211 --> 00:51:58,212
'cause most bodybuilders
that I know

896
00:51:58,213 --> 00:52:01,116
and that I've met
are on steroids,

897
00:52:01,117 --> 00:52:04,118
or have done steroids,
and for somebody who wants

898
00:52:04,119 --> 00:52:06,721
to portray themselves
as a fit and healthy person,

899
00:52:06,722 --> 00:52:08,689
that's not at all healthy.

900
00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:11,792
People go, "Ahh, steroids,"
man...

901
00:52:11,793 --> 00:52:12,861
Nobody can do that.

902
00:52:12,862 --> 00:52:14,696
Like, it's not easy to do.

903
00:52:14,697 --> 00:52:18,667
People don't respect it, they go, "Oh, I can
do that with steroids," no, you couldn't.

904
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:20,234
You couldn't do what I do!

905
00:52:20,235 --> 00:52:23,171
They come to the gym,
never did a workout,

906
00:52:23,172 --> 00:52:24,738
and then they find
on the internet...

907
00:52:24,739 --> 00:52:28,310
steroids... They sell steroids
on the internet.

908
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:34,181
Children, 15, 16 years old,
they order it...

909
00:52:34,182 --> 00:52:36,651
That's what I hate...
it's dangerous, very dangerous.

910
00:52:36,652 --> 00:52:38,520
If you do something extreme,

911
00:52:38,521 --> 00:52:42,857
you can't be healthy,
you gotta take some risks.

912
00:52:42,858 --> 00:52:46,294
So it's like, you know,
like racing...

913
00:52:46,295 --> 00:52:49,330
If you go Formula One,
you take the risk.

914
00:52:49,331 --> 00:52:54,301
Any time that you're using
performance enhancers,

915
00:52:54,302 --> 00:52:56,837
particularly when we haven't
studied them in the lab,

916
00:52:56,838 --> 00:52:58,839
to the level
that they can be used,

917
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:01,276
certainly, there can be
negative side effects.

918
00:53:01,277 --> 00:53:05,346
There is issues
with kidney damage,

919
00:53:05,347 --> 00:53:10,185
There is, what we do know,
is that the heart size increases

920
00:53:10,186 --> 00:53:14,388
because the heart is a muscle,
there's liver issues,

921
00:53:14,389 --> 00:53:17,658
it's quite toxic,
especially the oral drugs,

922
00:53:17,659 --> 00:53:21,930
that's why injectables
are one of the preferred drugs

923
00:53:21,931 --> 00:53:25,767
for minimizing health risks.

924
00:53:25,768 --> 00:53:29,203
I think the best answer
is to allow the athletes

925
00:53:29,204 --> 00:53:33,375
to use the drugs,
but provide medical treatment.

926
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:35,576
Get a group of very competitive
athletes together,

927
00:53:35,577 --> 00:53:37,912
everyone wants to win,
you've got large sums of money

928
00:53:37,913 --> 00:53:39,714
up for grabs,
guys are going to do

929
00:53:39,715 --> 00:53:41,283
whatever it takes to win.

930
00:53:41,284 --> 00:53:43,218
The bodybuilders
and the professional sport

931
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:46,955
of bodybuilding
has gone the next step.

932
00:53:46,956 --> 00:53:49,658
Where all of a sudden,
the body does not look

933
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:53,395
as acceptable,
simply because it's too big,

934
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:56,665
and it doesn't have
any talent behind it.

935
00:53:56,666 --> 00:54:01,569
And the neck is 23 inches
and the calves are 18.

936
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:03,538
The proportion is gone.

937
00:54:03,539 --> 00:54:05,839
The audience wants to see
a spectacle.

938
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,942
When they go to see a show,
they don't want to see

939
00:54:07,943 --> 00:54:09,743
someone that looks like them,

940
00:54:09,744 --> 00:54:11,812
they want to see
something extreme.

941
00:54:11,813 --> 00:54:14,281
So we have to get huge.

942
00:54:14,282 --> 00:54:15,683
We have to go to the next level.

943
00:54:15,684 --> 00:54:17,584
You know,
is there a limit to growth?

944
00:54:17,585 --> 00:54:20,689
Certainly, there's a limit, but
I don't know that we found it.

945
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:23,991
They ask the Olympic athletes,
if you could take a drug,

946
00:54:23,992 --> 00:54:26,794
right now, that would kill you
in five years,

947
00:54:26,795 --> 00:54:29,430
but guarantee you a gold medal,
would you take it?

948
00:54:29,431 --> 00:54:32,299
More that 50 percent said "Yes!"

949
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:34,935
They would take it, even knowing
it would kill them five years later.

950
00:54:34,936 --> 00:54:38,339
This is what these athletes do.

951
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:39,908
This this their lives.

952
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:42,377
This is their livelihood,
this is how they make money.

953
00:54:42,378 --> 00:54:43,877
This is everything they know.

954
00:54:43,878 --> 00:54:47,848
Do you really think you're gonna
convince them to stop?

955
00:54:47,849 --> 00:54:50,384
As time progresses,
the science of bodybuilding

956
00:54:50,385 --> 00:54:53,988
advances faster and faster,
and with it,

957
00:54:53,989 --> 00:54:56,525
the size of the muscles.

958
00:55:00,061 --> 00:55:02,530
One more major title this year.

959
00:55:03,699 --> 00:55:05,033
One down.

960
00:55:05,034 --> 00:55:06,634
One to go!

961
00:55:06,635 --> 00:55:09,837
Three, four, five, six...

962
00:55:09,838 --> 00:55:10,905
Come on, one way!

963
00:55:11,005 --> 00:55:13,841
Eight, nine...

964
00:55:13,842 --> 00:55:16,710
Ten!

965
00:55:16,711 --> 00:55:19,413
Every rep count!

966
00:55:19,414 --> 00:55:21,982
Every rep, come on!

967
00:55:21,983 --> 00:55:24,084
Bring the pain!

968
00:55:24,085 --> 00:55:27,625
- Six, seven, eight, nine...
- Fight it!

969
00:55:29,325 --> 00:55:31,426
My physique that I bring
to the Olympia this year...

970
00:55:31,427 --> 00:55:33,618
it's not the product of
three months of hard work,

971
00:55:33,818 --> 00:55:35,965
it's the product of over
20 years of hard work.

972
00:55:42,405 --> 00:55:44,605
I thought I'd be
retired by now, originally.

973
00:55:44,606 --> 00:55:47,808
I thought by 36, 35-36,
I'd be...

974
00:55:47,809 --> 00:55:50,444
I'd be retired, but...

975
00:55:50,445 --> 00:55:54,415
You know, I think I've had so many injuries,
I've had four significant injuries,

976
00:55:54,416 --> 00:55:57,919
since I've been pro,
and I think that set me back.

977
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,620
Due to the injuries,
Branch had to skip

978
00:55:59,621 --> 00:56:02,589
the 2010 and 2011 Olympias.

979
00:56:02,590 --> 00:56:06,461
Despite this, he continues
to live his life to the fullest.

980
00:56:07,763 --> 00:56:10,497
Branch, a few competitors
said that, "If you're gonna keep working out

981
00:56:10,498 --> 00:56:14,435
the way you're doing at the gym, you're going
to get injured before the big competition."

982
00:56:14,436 --> 00:56:16,571
What do you think about that?

983
00:56:16,572 --> 00:56:19,374
They're entitled
to their opinion.

984
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:23,111
But, you know,
I can imagine who that was,

985
00:56:23,112 --> 00:56:25,980
and they ain't gonna
beat me anyway, so...

986
00:56:25,981 --> 00:56:28,649
they don't really matter.

987
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:30,785
And the thing is,
the past two injuries I've had

988
00:56:30,786 --> 00:56:32,953
weren't in the gym,
they were outside the gym.

989
00:56:32,954 --> 00:56:36,691
So, I haven't been hurt
in the gym since...

990
00:56:36,692 --> 00:56:38,392
2003.

991
00:56:38,393 --> 00:56:41,495
C'mon.

992
00:56:41,496 --> 00:56:43,065
Let's go!

993
00:56:49,405 --> 00:56:50,171
Oh!

994
00:56:50,172 --> 00:56:51,538
Goddamn!

995
00:56:51,539 --> 00:56:53,707
Ouch!

996
00:56:53,708 --> 00:56:55,010
Son of a bitch!

997
00:57:00,483 --> 00:57:01,483
Goddamn, guys.

998
00:57:02,016 --> 00:57:04,618
The filming stops.

999
00:57:04,619 --> 00:57:06,587
Branch's hamstring is injured.

1000
00:57:06,588 --> 00:57:09,090
His future at the Olympia
is now uncertain.

1001
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:14,095
I just know that the end
of a bodybuilding career

1002
00:57:14,096 --> 00:57:16,830
is one injury away... one major
injury and you're toast.

1003
00:57:16,831 --> 00:57:19,634
No matter how hard you work,
and how perfect you are,

1004
00:57:19,635 --> 00:57:21,602
one injury and you're done.

1005
00:57:21,603 --> 00:57:23,937
The days of being
in the dungeon,

1006
00:57:23,938 --> 00:57:26,441
training with your hoodie on,

1007
00:57:26,442 --> 00:57:29,743
you know, "grunt and cuss"
bodybuilder,

1008
00:57:29,744 --> 00:57:32,779
that eats, sleeps and trains...
that's all he does... are over.

1009
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:35,517
You have to be able
to do other things.

1010
00:57:35,518 --> 00:57:37,718
I'm more focused
now on my career,

1011
00:57:37,719 --> 00:57:41,488
but of course I think about
the years after it

1012
00:57:41,489 --> 00:57:43,056
because,
I don't want to be like,

1013
00:57:43,057 --> 00:57:45,926
"Okay, now it is over,
so let's think about

1014
00:57:45,927 --> 00:57:47,595
what I can do now."

1015
00:57:47,596 --> 00:57:51,232
Of course, it would be nice
if I could get some

1016
00:57:51,233 --> 00:57:54,701
roles in the movies,
things like this.

1017
00:57:54,702 --> 00:57:59,107
I just I got a call
for a casting tomorrow

1018
00:57:59,108 --> 00:58:02,709
for an action film,
so we'll see...

1019
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:04,078
They're gonna fly me in...

1020
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:06,781
The movie star!

1021
00:58:06,782 --> 00:58:07,948
...with a private jet.

1022
00:58:07,949 --> 00:58:10,250
I don't want to waste my time

1023
00:58:10,251 --> 00:58:12,252
trying to be an actor
or something,

1024
00:58:12,253 --> 00:58:14,087
if I don't have
the talent for this.

1025
00:58:14,088 --> 00:58:16,790
There some that have
the personality.

1026
00:58:16,791 --> 00:58:19,627
When I started doing interviews
in the '70s,

1027
00:58:19,628 --> 00:58:22,129
the media always said,
"Finally there's someone

1028
00:58:22,130 --> 00:58:24,165
that loves to talk
about the sport,"

1029
00:58:24,166 --> 00:58:25,886
because for years
we tried to get interviews

1030
00:58:26,001 --> 00:58:28,770
and everyone just said,
"No, I'm not going to talk,"

1031
00:58:28,771 --> 00:58:31,506
because they were always
shy characters,

1032
00:58:31,507 --> 00:58:34,241
and they'd rather live
in a dungeon and work out,

1033
00:58:34,242 --> 00:58:37,912
and were very impressive,
but they didn't want to talk,

1034
00:58:37,913 --> 00:58:41,082
they felt too shy about it.

1035
00:58:41,083 --> 00:58:42,649
All these guys say
they want to be like Arnold,

1036
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:44,651
and be in the movies,
and stuff like that.

1037
00:58:44,652 --> 00:58:48,055
Sometimes, it's like pulling teeth
to get these guys to talk.

1038
00:58:48,056 --> 00:58:52,628
So, imagine giving them a script
they actually have to read.

1039
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:57,564
- Hi.
- Hi.

1040
00:58:57,565 --> 00:58:58,633
How you doing... oh!

1041
00:58:58,634 --> 00:59:00,267
Dennis, nice to meet you.

1042
00:59:00,268 --> 00:59:04,238
So, Emilio Ferrari
is directing this movie,

1043
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:06,707
and we're gonna start
shooting it in October,

1044
00:59:06,708 --> 00:59:09,544
but it is a comedy,
and it's kinda like

1045
00:59:09,545 --> 00:59:12,680
"Private Benjamin" meets
"Legally Blonde."

1046
00:59:12,681 --> 00:59:14,181
So we can have fun with this,

1047
00:59:14,182 --> 00:59:15,817
and if you want
to try something new,

1048
00:59:15,818 --> 00:59:18,085
or have improv or anything,

1049
00:59:18,086 --> 00:59:23,191
don't feel that
you can't do that, okay?

1050
00:59:23,192 --> 00:59:26,761
- So, you are reading for Robert.
- Robert, right.

1051
00:59:26,762 --> 00:59:28,796
Hello, I'm Robert...

1052
00:59:28,797 --> 00:59:30,230
Hello, I'm Robert Starkey.

1053
00:59:30,231 --> 00:59:32,306
Wow, you really love
this country.

1054
00:59:37,306 --> 00:59:40,040
- So, here's what...
- Uh... the United States.

1055
00:59:40,041 --> 00:59:42,243
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1056
00:59:42,244 --> 00:59:44,394
Let's try it again,
now there are some parts

1057
00:59:45,014 --> 00:59:47,749
where you are coughing
and mumbling,

1058
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,750
you know like, you're...

1059
00:59:49,751 --> 00:59:51,322
So play that a little bit.

1060
00:59:53,322 --> 00:59:56,223
Hello, I'm Robert Starkey.

1061
00:59:56,224 --> 00:59:59,593
If you sign this right now,
I can't guarantee it...

1062
00:59:59,594 --> 01:00:01,430
I can't guarantee,
by this time tomorrow

1063
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:04,064
you will be
in sunny Puerto Rico.

1064
01:00:04,065 --> 01:00:07,134
That was really good
and we're probably gonna have

1065
01:00:07,135 --> 01:00:09,636
callbacks, which I'm gonna
bring you back

1066
01:00:09,637 --> 01:00:12,140
to the director,
and that was funny.

1067
01:00:12,141 --> 01:00:14,042
So just take it and work on it,

1068
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:16,743
and we'll see each other later.

1069
01:00:16,744 --> 01:00:18,745
Thank you very much,
it was great.

1070
01:00:18,746 --> 01:00:20,948
- It was nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you, too.

1071
01:00:20,949 --> 01:00:22,717
- Thank you.
- All right, take care.

1072
01:00:38,132 --> 01:00:40,167
While playing basketball
in college,

1073
01:00:40,168 --> 01:00:43,404
Phil realized that he would
never play professionally,

1074
01:00:43,405 --> 01:00:46,207
but there was potential
in his genes,

1075
01:00:46,208 --> 01:00:48,375
potential that led him
to another sport.

1076
01:00:48,376 --> 01:00:49,777
That's right.

1077
01:00:53,248 --> 01:00:59,153
I would say quitting basketball,
I mean...

1078
01:00:59,154 --> 01:01:01,189
It wasn't really quitting,
I'll be honest,

1079
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:03,424
I just wasn't good enough
to play at the next level.

1080
01:01:03,425 --> 01:01:05,859
Those dreams, as far as like,
playing in the NBA,

1081
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:09,663
were just...
they were squashed.

1082
01:01:09,664 --> 01:01:11,665
- This is Phil Heath.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

1083
01:01:11,666 --> 01:01:13,202
Good to meet you.

1084
01:01:14,436 --> 01:01:17,038
At times, nostalgia kicks in.

1085
01:01:17,039 --> 01:01:21,375
He loved to play ball just as much
as he loves bodybuilding now.

1086
01:01:21,376 --> 01:01:24,111
When the opportunity
presents itself,

1087
01:01:24,112 --> 01:01:25,879
Phil enjoys to return
to the court

1088
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:27,448
to shoot some hoops.

1089
01:01:27,449 --> 01:01:30,350
When I decided to be a
bodybuilder and quit basketball,

1090
01:01:30,351 --> 01:01:33,821
I actually marked down the date,
it was October 8th, 2002,

1091
01:01:33,822 --> 01:01:36,089
and then the rest is history...
I got bit by that bug,

1092
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:38,459
and it was an amazing feeling
to know that,

1093
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:40,828
coming from a team sport...

1094
01:01:40,829 --> 01:01:43,296
You know,
you're being more concerned

1095
01:01:43,297 --> 01:01:45,732
with not just yourself,
but your teammates all the time,

1096
01:01:45,733 --> 01:01:47,334
and going against
a different type of opposition.

1097
01:01:47,335 --> 01:01:49,971
Playing basketball,
as opposed to bodybuilding,

1098
01:01:49,972 --> 01:01:52,939
where it's really
all about my effort.

1099
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:55,142
For me, as Mr. Olympia,
it's not about beating

1100
01:01:55,143 --> 01:01:56,977
your competition,
it's about crushing those dreams

1101
01:01:56,978 --> 01:02:00,849
of those other guys... and that's what I've
got to do, I've gotta crush their dreams.

1102
01:02:03,485 --> 01:02:06,120
It's a gloomy afternoon.

1103
01:02:06,121 --> 01:02:08,388
Victor travels to
the Bev Francis Powerhouse Gym

1104
01:02:08,389 --> 01:02:11,459
in Syosset, New York,
to see a legend,

1105
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:14,395
his mentor, Steve Weinberger.

1106
01:02:14,396 --> 01:02:16,763
Today is his judgment day.

1107
01:02:16,764 --> 01:02:19,267
- Hey, what's goin' on, brother?
- 'Sup, Steve?

1108
01:02:19,268 --> 01:02:21,102
- How you doin'?
- Good, good, how you doin'?

1109
01:02:21,103 --> 01:02:23,270
I'm okay, how you feel?

1110
01:02:23,271 --> 01:02:25,506
I'm okay, I've felt better.

1111
01:02:25,507 --> 01:02:27,010
Yeah...
how's it coming along?

1112
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:30,076
I don't feel confident.

1113
01:02:30,077 --> 01:02:33,480
Lemme close the door...
too much noise out there.

1114
01:02:33,481 --> 01:02:35,249
As soon as I got out,
I started training,

1115
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:37,785
and getting back on my regimen...
the training's been good,

1116
01:02:37,786 --> 01:02:42,189
everything's been good,
no injuries, you know, and, uh...

1117
01:02:42,190 --> 01:02:45,091
Everything's good, it's just,
is it "Olympia good"?

1118
01:02:45,092 --> 01:02:46,993
Is it "Olympia ready"?

1119
01:02:46,994 --> 01:02:49,476
- Let's see what you look like.
- All right.

1120
01:03:01,276 --> 01:03:03,176
For Rikers Island,
you look great, Vic,

1121
01:03:03,177 --> 01:03:05,516
but for the Olympia...

1122
01:03:07,216 --> 01:03:10,084
I don't think you'll have enough time,
honestly, I'm sorry.

1123
01:03:10,085 --> 01:03:11,785
If I was you,
I would shut it down,

1124
01:03:11,786 --> 01:03:14,187
and just concentrate
on next year.

1125
01:03:14,188 --> 01:03:16,891
I don't think there's enough time,
I'm sorry.

1126
01:03:30,572 --> 01:03:33,174
How you feelin', Victor?

1127
01:03:33,175 --> 01:03:34,808
I just don't want to talk,
right now.

1128
01:03:34,809 --> 01:03:37,044
Please, c'mon.

1129
01:03:37,045 --> 01:03:38,245
Hey, V.

1130
01:03:38,246 --> 01:03:41,948
Yeah, I just saw Steve.

1131
01:03:41,949 --> 01:03:44,517
Yeah, I decided
I'm not doing the show.

1132
01:03:44,518 --> 01:03:48,288
He's a guy that's gotten no breaks,
with his sister getting murdered, and...

1133
01:03:48,289 --> 01:03:50,124
this is his second time in jail,
and...

1134
01:03:50,125 --> 01:03:53,426
just all these problems,
it just seems that...

1135
01:03:53,427 --> 01:03:57,531
You never know why some good
people never get breaks,

1136
01:03:57,532 --> 01:03:59,332
and some bad people get breaks.

1137
01:03:59,333 --> 01:04:01,435
And Victor is one of those good
guys that never get a break,

1138
01:04:01,436 --> 01:04:04,474
and I feel bad for him,
I really do.

1139
01:04:18,253 --> 01:04:22,025
Hide lives a solitary life in Venice,
California, near the beach.

1140
01:04:22,725 --> 01:04:25,058
When he looks across the water,
he sometimes imagines

1141
01:04:25,059 --> 01:04:27,127
he can see home.

1142
01:04:27,128 --> 01:04:28,995
Though he is married,
he spends most of his time

1143
01:04:28,996 --> 01:04:32,133
separate from his wife,
who often travels to Japan

1144
01:04:32,134 --> 01:04:35,468
to take care of his family...
a family that has never fully

1145
01:04:35,469 --> 01:04:39,906
accepted his life path,
nor fully understood it.

1146
01:04:39,907 --> 01:04:41,375
They don't watch my shows,

1147
01:04:41,376 --> 01:04:45,279
but they call me
and I call them.

1148
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:49,517
It's a really hard sport.

1149
01:04:49,518 --> 01:04:55,391
For me, my thinking is that
they can't enjoy their life.

1150
01:04:57,391 --> 01:05:00,493
I was born, born
to be bodybuilder.

1151
01:05:00,494 --> 01:05:03,163
I'm a bodybuilder until I die.

1152
01:05:03,164 --> 01:05:08,035
I hope that one day
my family understands.

1153
01:05:08,036 --> 01:05:09,971
People thought that
it's just impossible

1154
01:05:09,972 --> 01:05:12,640
for Japanese or Asian people

1155
01:05:12,641 --> 01:05:15,376
to step on Olympia stage...

1156
01:05:17,378 --> 01:05:21,114
Because of their structure
or genetics, I don't know...

1157
01:05:21,115 --> 01:05:25,285
I wouldn't say I'm small
'cause I'm 5'5".

1158
01:05:25,286 --> 01:05:29,223
But I weigh 220,
which is pretty heavy.

1159
01:05:29,224 --> 01:05:30,223
Olympia.

1160
01:05:30,224 --> 01:05:32,692
Nice... are you gonna win?

1161
01:05:32,693 --> 01:05:34,495
- Say yes.
- Yeah, I will.

1162
01:05:34,496 --> 01:05:36,663
Yeah, say
"I'm gonna win the Olympia!"

1163
01:05:36,664 --> 01:05:38,299
Yes I will.

1164
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:41,003
I'm still, you know,
challenging the title.

1165
01:05:42,003 --> 01:05:48,075
If I'm the champion, I would say
there will be a lot of pressure.

1166
01:05:48,076 --> 01:05:50,944
There's always that pressure...
you gotta be your best,

1167
01:05:50,945 --> 01:05:54,647
'cause you're only as good
as your last contest, in our sport...

1168
01:05:54,648 --> 01:05:57,951
No matter how well you placed at the
last show, if you do poorly at this one,

1169
01:05:57,952 --> 01:05:59,419
this is the one
everybody remembers...

1170
01:05:59,420 --> 01:06:02,422
I think that's why a lot of guys fail,
is because there's so much pressure.

1171
01:06:02,423 --> 01:06:04,658
Sponsors drop you.

1172
01:06:04,659 --> 01:06:06,627
I better be ready, you know.

1173
01:06:06,628 --> 01:06:08,062
I better be ready to bring it.

1174
01:06:08,063 --> 01:06:08,962
Here we go!

1175
01:06:08,963 --> 01:06:09,730
Fight!

1176
01:06:09,731 --> 01:06:10,730
Perfect!

1177
01:06:10,731 --> 01:06:11,731
Make 'em grow!

1178
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,533
Here we go.

1179
01:06:13,534 --> 01:06:15,069
No pain, no pain.

1180
01:06:15,070 --> 01:06:15,970
Fight!

1181
01:06:15,971 --> 01:06:17,171
That's it!

1182
01:06:17,172 --> 01:06:18,522
You got this, man, no pain!

1183
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:21,575
As a competition looms
in the near future,

1184
01:06:21,576 --> 01:06:23,377
the pressure builds.

1185
01:06:23,378 --> 01:06:26,379
Training and rigorous routines
take a toll on the body,

1186
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:28,016
as well on the mind.

1187
01:06:29,016 --> 01:06:31,185
Each bodybuilder seeks out
different ways

1188
01:06:31,186 --> 01:06:33,554
to alleviate the stress.

1189
01:07:12,327 --> 01:07:17,464
Is there anybody that you're
worried about competing against?

1190
01:07:17,465 --> 01:07:22,069
There's probably two guys
in the world who, I think,

1191
01:07:22,070 --> 01:07:25,272
if they bring their best,
and I bring my best, they can beat me.

1192
01:07:25,273 --> 01:07:28,341
Other than that, nobody's gonna beat me,
so I just gotta come with my best.

1193
01:07:28,342 --> 01:07:30,276
I want everybody
to bring their A game,

1194
01:07:30,277 --> 01:07:32,212
and if somebody beats me,
I'll shake his hand,

1195
01:07:32,213 --> 01:07:35,317
'cause he outworked me,
but I don't see it happening.

1196
01:07:40,521 --> 01:07:44,491
I met Phil
at a mutual friend's restaurant

1197
01:07:44,492 --> 01:07:47,428
after his second
bodybuilding competition,

1198
01:07:47,429 --> 01:07:52,433
that he won his class,
but he didn't take the overall.

1199
01:07:52,434 --> 01:07:55,502
And I just knew, like,
I just saw the...

1200
01:07:55,503 --> 01:07:58,404
what he was working for,
that he was gonna become great,

1201
01:07:58,405 --> 01:08:00,274
and that everything
was gonna go for him.

1202
01:08:00,275 --> 01:08:01,841
And he's like "Really...
you really think

1203
01:08:01,842 --> 01:08:03,611
I'm gonna make it that big?"
and I said, "Absolutely,

1204
01:08:03,612 --> 01:08:05,379
I think you're gonna go
all the way."

1205
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:07,314
I'm glad I have
a family that can go on

1206
01:08:07,315 --> 01:08:09,450
this journey with me,
I'm not going at this separate,

1207
01:08:09,451 --> 01:08:11,352
and them just watching.

1208
01:08:11,353 --> 01:08:12,752
They're there.

1209
01:08:12,753 --> 01:08:14,721
They'll be there.

1210
01:08:14,722 --> 01:08:18,158
I'll have the list
for tickets for you by tomorrow.

1211
01:08:18,159 --> 01:08:19,425
Did you spell my name right?

1212
01:08:19,426 --> 01:08:21,594
I'm just kidding.

1213
01:08:21,595 --> 01:08:23,464
So here's the thing with Phil and I,

1214
01:08:23,465 --> 01:08:25,985
we always got along, man...
I've never had a problem with him...

1215
01:08:26,070 --> 01:08:28,836
I was in Denver last year,
we went out to dinner, and then I leave,

1216
01:08:28,837 --> 01:08:31,471
and I hear he was talking shit...
and I was like,

1217
01:08:31,472 --> 01:08:33,640
"Okay, you're a scumbag...
you say one thing in my face

1218
01:08:33,641 --> 01:08:35,542
and something else to my back,"
that's fine.

1219
01:08:35,543 --> 01:08:38,379
And to me, that says
he's insecure and he's scared.

1220
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:40,313
I don't respect his work ethic.

1221
01:08:40,314 --> 01:08:43,483
I don't respect him
as a person, with his attitude.

1222
01:08:43,484 --> 01:08:45,786
But he's become
an excellent bodybuilder.

1223
01:08:45,787 --> 01:08:48,154
He's not a very good role model
for the sport.

1224
01:08:48,155 --> 01:08:50,657
Is he as dominant
as everybody thinks he is?

1225
01:08:50,658 --> 01:08:53,394
No, he's not... but I've seen
him train and I'm like,

1226
01:08:53,395 --> 01:08:55,696
"Man, his back sucks,
his calves suck,

1227
01:08:55,697 --> 01:08:59,532
his hamstrings suck," man, that stuff, you
fix it like this, like, I can't build muscle

1228
01:08:59,533 --> 01:09:03,336
nearly as easily as that guy,
and yet I'm doing it, you know?

1229
01:09:03,337 --> 01:09:05,907
It ain't all talk
when you're on that stage, man.

1230
01:09:10,912 --> 01:09:12,880
Phil Heath has had
a lot of gifts.

1231
01:09:12,881 --> 01:09:15,381
He's a gift, he's "The Gift."

1232
01:09:15,382 --> 01:09:18,586
I don't represent gifts,
I really don't.

1233
01:09:18,587 --> 01:09:22,422
He's had a lot of help,
a lot of help.

1234
01:09:22,423 --> 01:09:25,326
It's not like I had people
handing me money and stuff.

1235
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:30,598
When I first came into this sport,
I was working two jobs, unlike him.

1236
01:09:30,599 --> 01:09:34,635
I don't even know if he has a resume...
I don't even know if he knows what that is.

1237
01:09:34,636 --> 01:09:37,837
Easy, easy.

1238
01:09:37,838 --> 01:09:39,806
Guess what, Kai?

1239
01:09:39,807 --> 01:09:42,276
You've been bodybuilding
for 20 years.

1240
01:09:42,277 --> 01:09:43,711
I'm already better than you.

1241
01:09:43,712 --> 01:09:45,478
You know it, but now
you're making an excuse,

1242
01:09:45,479 --> 01:09:49,349
saying,
"He got this, he got that."

1243
01:09:49,350 --> 01:09:51,785
Each man's body
will represent years

1244
01:09:51,786 --> 01:09:55,523
of focus and concentration.

1245
01:09:57,692 --> 01:09:59,860
It'll be a great event.

1246
01:10:01,962 --> 01:10:04,631
You're one injury away
from your career being over.

1247
01:10:04,632 --> 01:10:07,568
I've fought too hard
to get where I'm at,

1248
01:10:07,569 --> 01:10:09,303
to slide back down.

1249
01:10:09,304 --> 01:10:11,237
I'm not one to lay down
and cry about it.

1250
01:10:11,238 --> 01:10:13,374
I'm gonna take this thing
by the horns,

1251
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:18,212
I'm gonna overcome it... I'm doing
everything I can do, man, I'm 100 percent.

1252
01:10:24,286 --> 01:10:25,286
Have a dream.

1253
01:10:25,287 --> 01:10:27,287
Everybody need to have a dream.

1254
01:10:27,288 --> 01:10:29,888
Have a dream and go after it
with everything you got.

1255
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:36,330
Time to make Phil
look small, Bro.

1256
01:10:36,331 --> 01:10:37,997
Come on!
Make 'em all look small.

1257
01:10:37,998 --> 01:10:38,998
Yup.

1258
01:10:54,751 --> 01:10:57,451
They're gonna announce my name,
crowd's gonna go crazy,

1259
01:10:57,452 --> 01:10:59,653
I'm gonna hit my front
double bicep, this and that.

1260
01:10:59,654 --> 01:11:01,255
Crowd's gonna go,

1261
01:11:01,256 --> 01:11:02,689
"Whoa!"

1262
01:11:02,690 --> 01:11:04,590
And I'm gonna just...

1263
01:11:04,591 --> 01:11:07,528
I'm gonna feel...

1264
01:11:07,529 --> 01:11:09,997
like a true Adonis, man,
like a god.

1265
01:11:12,833 --> 01:11:15,369
But this trophy is mine.

1266
01:12:54,569 --> 01:12:56,019
Come on, take your shirt off.

1267
01:13:00,375 --> 01:13:02,075
Yo, who do you think
was the best ever?

1268
01:13:02,076 --> 01:13:03,143
Best ever?

1269
01:13:03,144 --> 01:13:04,611
Arnold or Lee?

1270
01:13:04,612 --> 01:13:05,612
Arnold.

1271
01:13:05,613 --> 01:13:08,982
- Arnold is better than Lee Haney?
- Of course.

1272
01:13:08,983 --> 01:13:11,084
That's a big statement
to say on camera!

1273
01:13:11,085 --> 01:13:13,086
How many, how many, how many
Olympias has Arnold got?

1274
01:13:13,087 --> 01:13:13,953
Seven.

1275
01:13:13,954 --> 01:13:15,022
How many Lee got?

1276
01:13:15,023 --> 01:13:16,456
- Eight.
- Eight.

1277
01:13:16,457 --> 01:13:17,691
So who will be better?

1278
01:13:17,692 --> 01:13:19,760
Arnold, still Arnold!

1279
01:13:19,761 --> 01:13:21,562
Hold on, wait a minute,
so we go back...

1280
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:24,465
Then you gotta go with what
century you was in or what...

1281
01:13:24,466 --> 01:13:26,934
It doesn't matter how many
Olympias he won.

1282
01:13:26,935 --> 01:13:28,969
- It doesn't matter?
- Doesn't matter.

1283
01:13:28,970 --> 01:13:30,504
Who's had the best, what year...

1284
01:13:30,505 --> 01:13:32,475
Who had the best
chill body ever?

1285
01:13:34,475 --> 01:13:36,477
- Ronnie Coleman.
- Ronnie Coleman?

1286
01:13:36,478 --> 01:13:38,077
He was a good one.

1287
01:13:38,078 --> 01:13:39,446
All right, big...
hold on, one thing!

1288
01:13:39,447 --> 01:13:40,880
Let's arm wrestle.

1289
01:13:40,881 --> 01:13:42,984
- You lost!
- Oh!

1290
01:13:50,824 --> 01:13:54,862
Olympia, a plain in Greece
in the western Peloponnese.

1291
01:13:54,863 --> 01:13:56,996
The ancient Olympic Games
were said to be played

1292
01:13:56,997 --> 01:13:59,198
on this stretch of ground,

1293
01:13:59,199 --> 01:14:02,870
and it held the chief sanctuary
of the supreme god, Zeus.

1294
01:14:02,871 --> 01:14:05,006
Now on a stage in Vegas,
the supreme man,

1295
01:14:06,006 --> 01:14:07,876
Mr. Olympia, will be crowned.

1296
01:14:17,819 --> 01:14:20,219
When I go back
and I think of the Olympia,

1297
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:22,622
I go back and I think
of Arnold Schwarzenegger,

1298
01:14:22,623 --> 01:14:25,224
when the first prize money
was $1,000.

1299
01:14:25,225 --> 01:14:27,961
And then today,
in the 48th Olympia,

1300
01:14:27,962 --> 01:14:30,714
we're hoping to give out prize money
of one million dollars.

1301
01:14:31,032 --> 01:14:34,134
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

1302
01:14:34,135 --> 01:14:37,170
Welcome to Joe Weider's
Olympia fitness

1303
01:14:37,171 --> 01:14:40,707
and performance weekend 2012!

1304
01:14:46,213 --> 01:14:47,880
Just before the competition,

1305
01:14:47,881 --> 01:14:51,617
the contenders begin
their pre-show preparations.

1306
01:14:51,618 --> 01:14:54,621
The most agonizing
is dropping their water weight.

1307
01:14:54,622 --> 01:14:57,791
We always need to lose
a little bit of water

1308
01:14:57,792 --> 01:14:59,725
in the last couple of hours
before the show

1309
01:14:59,726 --> 01:15:02,161
because on stage,
with all those lights

1310
01:15:02,162 --> 01:15:05,866
and the tan and the oil,
you still look a little watery.

1311
01:15:05,867 --> 01:15:07,968
If you lose the water,
it makes you look

1312
01:15:07,969 --> 01:15:11,604
on stage much, much dryer
because all the cuts,

1313
01:15:11,605 --> 01:15:15,075
all the separation, coming though more
and more, you know?

1314
01:15:15,076 --> 01:15:17,711
Now I'll introduce
the 19 competitors here

1315
01:15:17,712 --> 01:15:21,214
to vie for the title
of Mr. Olympia.

1316
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:23,282
Before Olympia,
a press conference is held

1317
01:15:23,283 --> 01:15:25,051
for the contenders.

1318
01:15:25,052 --> 01:15:27,219
For the first time,
but not the last,

1319
01:15:27,220 --> 01:15:28,957
they are on stage together.

1320
01:15:43,604 --> 01:15:46,572
What do you think about people
saying Phil can't be beat

1321
01:15:46,573 --> 01:15:48,542
at this year's Olympia
tomorrow night?

1322
01:15:53,081 --> 01:15:55,216
I don't give a damn
about what people say.

1323
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:01,621
I think I'm a better poser
than Branch.

1324
01:16:01,622 --> 01:16:05,325
Well, I think I'm a better
bodybuilder than Dennis.

1325
01:16:05,326 --> 01:16:08,176
This is a bodybuilding contest,
not a dance contest, baby.

1326
01:16:12,934 --> 01:16:14,701
Going into tomorrow night,

1327
01:16:14,702 --> 01:16:16,737
I'm crossing my fingers,
praying to God

1328
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:19,872
that I can be at my best,
because my best

1329
01:16:19,873 --> 01:16:22,041
will be good enough
to win another Sandow.

1330
01:16:22,042 --> 01:16:23,211
No question.

1331
01:16:25,313 --> 01:16:27,747
I'm happy I'm here,
I worked hard for it.

1332
01:16:27,748 --> 01:16:30,415
You'll see the best package
you've ever seen tomorrow night.

1333
01:16:31,853 --> 01:16:36,255
If you and Phil Heath
are 100 percent on game day,

1334
01:16:36,256 --> 01:16:37,992
who wins?

1335
01:16:43,363 --> 01:16:45,733
I expect to be
the last man standing this year.

1336
01:16:57,979 --> 01:17:01,081
A fallen warrior
arrives in Las Vegas.

1337
01:17:01,082 --> 01:17:03,950
It pains him to be a spectator,

1338
01:17:03,951 --> 01:17:06,185
for this sport
and its contenders

1339
01:17:06,186 --> 01:17:08,287
have been
his most constant family.

1340
01:17:08,288 --> 01:17:10,890
My phone used
to ring off the hook, you know?

1341
01:17:10,891 --> 01:17:14,760
Now it's a little quiet
and it's... damn, you know?

1342
01:17:14,761 --> 01:17:16,196
Am I taking it personal?

1343
01:17:16,197 --> 01:17:17,964
It's like you really can't,
you know?

1344
01:17:17,965 --> 01:17:19,099
It's what it is.

1345
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:20,901
Remember, it's... it's a business

1346
01:17:20,902 --> 01:17:22,868
and if you're not producing,

1347
01:17:22,869 --> 01:17:25,072
they could just drop you,
and that's something

1348
01:17:25,073 --> 01:17:28,742
I might have to do as well,
go into my next show

1349
01:17:28,743 --> 01:17:33,313
without a sponsor, and that's gonna be
one of the biggest challenges of my life,

1350
01:17:33,314 --> 01:17:35,181
not just coming back from injury

1351
01:17:35,182 --> 01:17:38,285
or coming back from seven months
of being incarcerated,

1352
01:17:38,286 --> 01:17:42,221
it's gonna be
competing as a free agent.

1353
01:17:42,222 --> 01:17:44,357
That goes
into the whole question of,

1354
01:17:44,358 --> 01:17:46,960
"Does politics exist
in bodybuilding?"

1355
01:17:46,961 --> 01:17:49,261
It's alive and well.

1356
01:17:49,262 --> 01:17:52,899
The hypocrisy is part of the business,
it's part of it.

1357
01:18:00,108 --> 01:18:04,144
The makings of a champion
are elusive.

1358
01:18:04,145 --> 01:18:06,278
Is it in the genes?

1359
01:18:06,279 --> 01:18:08,081
Are some destined for greatness

1360
01:18:08,082 --> 01:18:11,019
while others doomed
to mediocrity?

1361
01:18:12,019 --> 01:18:15,255
Or is a warrior made,
forged out of steel,

1362
01:18:15,256 --> 01:18:17,189
honed from oak
and chiseled from the stone

1363
01:18:17,190 --> 01:18:19,326
of his skilled hands?

1364
01:18:19,327 --> 01:18:20,894
The Mr. Olympia Competition

1365
01:18:20,895 --> 01:18:24,965
has been sanctioned
by the IFBB since 1965.

1366
01:18:24,966 --> 01:18:27,216
It alone decides
who is the best in the world.

1367
01:18:28,002 --> 01:18:29,236
I mean, look at this.

1368
01:18:29,237 --> 01:18:30,877
This is what Mr. Olympia
should look like.

1369
01:18:31,005 --> 01:18:31,971
Thank you, I appreciate it.

1370
01:18:31,972 --> 01:18:32,973
I saw your wife yesterday.

1371
01:18:32,974 --> 01:18:34,107
Yeah, yeah, she told me.

1372
01:18:34,108 --> 01:18:35,776
Yeah, for sure, yeah, for sure.

1373
01:18:35,777 --> 01:18:39,112
My mom says she saw you too
and yeah, you know?

1374
01:18:39,113 --> 01:18:40,813
We're huge fans of yours,
trust me.

1375
01:18:41,181 --> 01:18:42,282
Come on, Branch.

1376
01:18:42,283 --> 01:18:43,733
I didn't even get to pump up!

1377
01:18:47,856 --> 01:18:50,256
Can someone bring me
some dumbbells or something?

1378
01:18:50,257 --> 01:18:53,059
We're back
at the 2012 Mr. Olympia.

1379
01:18:53,060 --> 01:18:55,728
I'm Lane Norton
with my co-host, Larry Pepe,

1380
01:18:55,729 --> 01:18:57,898
and Larry, we talked about...

1381
01:18:57,899 --> 01:18:59,801
is this the beginning
of a run for Phil?

1382
01:19:00,001 --> 01:19:02,102
If he hits it tonight,
do you think he starts

1383
01:19:02,103 --> 01:19:04,304
to put these guys
more in his rear view,

1384
01:19:04,305 --> 01:19:05,806
and start to build
on that momentum

1385
01:19:06,006 --> 01:19:09,442
and maybe get three, four,
five, six Mr. Olympias?

1386
01:19:09,443 --> 01:19:13,446
I think coming in, we thought
the question for Phil is:

1387
01:19:13,447 --> 01:19:16,116
Is this gonna be
that type of performance

1388
01:19:16,117 --> 01:19:19,551
where you just look up there, you see him
and you say, "It's him,"

1389
01:19:20,020 --> 01:19:22,922
and everybody else
kinda battling out for second.

1390
01:19:22,923 --> 01:19:26,960
I think we now feel
that it's him and Kai Greene.

1391
01:19:26,961 --> 01:19:28,361
Ladies and gentlemen,
as you know,

1392
01:19:28,362 --> 01:19:30,162
the Mr. Olympia final results
will be based

1393
01:19:30,163 --> 01:19:31,898
on a combination
of both tonight's

1394
01:19:31,899 --> 01:19:34,401
and tomorrow's scores.

1395
01:19:34,402 --> 01:19:36,836
The lights flash.

1396
01:19:36,837 --> 01:19:38,338
The pre-judging begins.

1397
01:19:40,975 --> 01:19:43,977
One by one,
the athletes pose on stage,

1398
01:19:43,978 --> 01:19:47,313
their bodies are exposed
and ridiculed for any failure

1399
01:19:47,314 --> 01:19:49,250
in symmetry and conditioning.

1400
01:20:29,857 --> 01:20:33,425
There's just something to be
said for the dude that can...

1401
01:20:33,426 --> 01:20:36,328
Man, he can...

1402
01:20:36,329 --> 01:20:39,899
He can run up in there
with an arm

1403
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:43,435
tied behind his back
and still...

1404
01:20:43,436 --> 01:20:45,405
he's still a deadly dude.

1405
01:20:49,243 --> 01:20:51,279
Man, you still gotta watch out
for him!

1406
01:21:01,188 --> 01:21:03,456
And even with that,

1407
01:21:03,457 --> 01:21:07,359
this dude is still fighting
for his life.

1408
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:10,429
And then...

1409
01:21:10,430 --> 01:21:14,934
slowly...

1410
01:21:14,935 --> 01:21:18,139
persuade the masses
to start to favor him.

1411
01:21:21,141 --> 01:21:23,276
When you line up
the best in the world,

1412
01:21:23,277 --> 01:21:25,111
it's so easy to judge.

1413
01:21:25,112 --> 01:21:27,580
When you're right there
in person,

1414
01:21:27,581 --> 01:21:29,282
you see everything.

1415
01:21:29,283 --> 01:21:31,117
Sometimes a photographer
will take a picture

1416
01:21:31,118 --> 01:21:34,153
and Phil's looking great,
Jay doesn't look great,

1417
01:21:34,154 --> 01:21:35,921
or Kai or Branch,

1418
01:21:35,922 --> 01:21:37,624
you need to see it all together

1419
01:21:37,625 --> 01:21:40,993
and also, it's not the clearest
of quality on the internet,

1420
01:21:40,994 --> 01:21:42,461
not like in living color.

1421
01:21:42,462 --> 01:21:45,198
Being there and seeing it,
it's pretty easy.

1422
01:21:55,743 --> 01:21:57,943
Phil Heath and Kai Greene,
right off the bat,

1423
01:21:57,944 --> 01:22:00,179
seem to separate themselves
from the pack.

1424
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:03,183
Those two clearly,
Number One and Number Two.

1425
01:22:03,184 --> 01:22:04,917
If there was any question,

1426
01:22:04,918 --> 01:22:07,153
we answered that
in the final call-out

1427
01:22:07,154 --> 01:22:09,989
when they were the only two
brought back, center stage.

1428
01:22:09,990 --> 01:22:12,959
I think there's a lot of support
out there for Kai Greene,

1429
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:17,162
there's a lot of people who think
that he's winning this contest.

1430
01:22:17,163 --> 01:22:20,399
Listen to me, you beat him
every freakin' shot.

1431
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:22,669
Hands down.

1432
01:22:22,670 --> 01:22:26,206
Hands down, okay?

1433
01:22:26,207 --> 01:22:29,041
And the feeling was,
he was terrible.

1434
01:22:29,042 --> 01:22:31,144
He was picking
your best shots too,

1435
01:22:31,145 --> 01:22:32,711
side triceps,

1436
01:22:32,712 --> 01:22:35,415
Back double biceps,
you frickin' creamed him.

1437
01:22:35,416 --> 01:22:38,385
Do you really think that,
George?

1438
01:22:38,386 --> 01:22:41,720
You have the frickin' edge,
would I lie to you?

1439
01:22:41,721 --> 01:22:44,724
It's Mr. Olympia,
the best of the best.

1440
01:22:44,725 --> 01:22:45,558
You saw it.

1441
01:22:45,559 --> 01:22:46,526
Yeah, exa...

1442
01:22:46,527 --> 01:22:47,394
Once you start, you know?

1443
01:22:47,395 --> 01:22:49,996
That was getting close
with the whole Kai thing and...

1444
01:22:49,997 --> 01:22:53,032
Kai starts good, he started getting better

1445
01:22:53,033 --> 01:22:55,434
until he becomes great and then,

1446
01:22:55,435 --> 01:22:57,703
and then you shave it down
to the top guys

1447
01:22:57,704 --> 01:23:02,041
and those top guys
were Phil and Kai.

1448
01:23:02,042 --> 01:23:04,711
The drama came in there,
'cause first you go,

1449
01:23:04,712 --> 01:23:08,180
"Okay, yeah, you know, Phil's walking
away with this," then you look, you go,

1450
01:23:08,181 --> 01:23:10,282
"Wait a minute, this is getting
closer than I think."

1451
01:23:10,283 --> 01:23:14,254
The more you look,
the closer it got.

1452
01:23:14,255 --> 01:23:16,989
I mean, I don't know
how much tighter I can get.

1453
01:23:16,990 --> 01:23:19,040
I wouldn't try to get fuller
if I was you.

1454
01:23:20,027 --> 01:23:21,728
Thank you.

1455
01:23:21,729 --> 01:23:24,630
I mean, really.

1456
01:23:24,631 --> 01:23:28,201
There's no way I could be
any tighter than I was.

1457
01:23:28,202 --> 01:23:31,371
I mean, I lose room
all the way up past my hip.

1458
01:23:31,372 --> 01:23:34,073
What else can I do?

1459
01:23:34,074 --> 01:23:36,412
I mean, you tell me
where I can be tighter.

1460
01:23:39,112 --> 01:23:40,712
I think I was tighter
than last year,

1461
01:23:40,713 --> 01:23:43,717
easily, easily but...

1462
01:23:44,717 --> 01:23:48,122
I think what I presented
was good enough for the win.

1463
01:23:49,122 --> 01:23:50,591
But we'll wait and see.

1464
01:23:51,591 --> 01:23:54,161
- Want some water, champ?
- No, I'm good.

1465
01:23:57,163 --> 01:23:59,233
Not always gonna hear
what you want.

1466
01:24:02,368 --> 01:24:04,207
So that's when you exit.

1467
01:24:06,207 --> 01:24:08,757
Because you don't need
to hear negativity right now.

1468
01:24:11,111 --> 01:24:12,711
If anything,
I like to be the guy

1469
01:24:12,712 --> 01:24:17,082
that smiles,
plays nicely, you know?

1470
01:24:17,083 --> 01:24:18,751
But I'm trying
to take your head off

1471
01:24:18,752 --> 01:24:22,188
just like anybody else.

1472
01:24:22,189 --> 01:24:23,289
Don't sleep!

1473
01:24:38,506 --> 01:24:41,508
Okay, now I am starting
to get irritated,

1474
01:24:41,509 --> 01:24:44,113
like, I can't deal
with that shit right now.

1475
01:24:46,113 --> 01:24:47,613
You know what I'm saying?

1476
01:24:47,614 --> 01:24:49,482
I can't think
like that right now.

1477
01:24:49,483 --> 01:24:51,751
That shit has no importance
whatsoever

1478
01:24:51,752 --> 01:24:53,519
to me winning this show.

1479
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:56,121
We won last year
with a perfect score.

1480
01:24:56,122 --> 01:24:59,158
It'd be nice to try
to do it again.

1481
01:24:59,159 --> 01:25:02,228
It would be nice, I mean,
I don't know that's Hany's goal.

1482
01:25:02,229 --> 01:25:03,563
That's mine.

1483
01:25:03,564 --> 01:25:05,230
It's always a goal
to try to win.

1484
01:25:05,231 --> 01:25:06,765
To win, perfect score.

1485
01:25:06,766 --> 01:25:10,435
I mean, this is definitely a hard focus
right now, there's no soft focus at all.

1486
01:25:10,436 --> 01:25:12,738
Like, this is definitely
very serious.

1487
01:25:12,739 --> 01:25:15,642
When you start stressing,
your body starts changing.

1488
01:25:15,643 --> 01:25:17,376
And just...
and a lot of people

1489
01:25:17,377 --> 01:25:20,746
who've done competitions
have looked absolutely amazing,

1490
01:25:20,747 --> 01:25:23,215
and then, all of a sudden,
the stress hormone kicks in,

1491
01:25:23,216 --> 01:25:26,853
and their bodies just kinda fade away
and they don't understand what happened.

1492
01:25:26,854 --> 01:25:30,290
This is not where you let off
the gas, either.

1493
01:25:30,291 --> 01:25:31,691
I'm gonna have to get going.

1494
01:25:40,801 --> 01:25:42,434
Catch your breath, that's right.

1495
01:25:42,435 --> 01:25:44,636
- Huh?
- Catch your breath.

1496
01:25:44,637 --> 01:25:45,637
Come on!

1497
01:25:49,643 --> 01:25:51,211
That's right.

1498
01:25:51,212 --> 01:25:52,579
Yeah, if you want.

1499
01:25:56,783 --> 01:25:58,283
I know I'm the champ.

1500
01:25:58,284 --> 01:25:59,786
I don't have to keep saying it.

1501
01:25:59,787 --> 01:26:02,287
They know I'm the champ, too.

1502
01:26:02,288 --> 01:26:04,157
My title is Mr. Olympia.

1503
01:26:04,158 --> 01:26:07,426
Theirs isn't,
and they're trying to get there?

1504
01:26:07,427 --> 01:26:11,464
They've gotta fight me all day.

1505
01:26:11,465 --> 01:26:13,500
There's no way I'm gonna lose.

1506
01:26:29,750 --> 01:26:31,384
The champ takes a moment
to drive

1507
01:26:31,385 --> 01:26:34,487
through the streets of Vegas
to clear his head.

1508
01:26:34,488 --> 01:26:36,221
The most important battle
of his life

1509
01:26:36,222 --> 01:26:38,625
lies here moments away.

1510
01:26:38,626 --> 01:26:41,595
The battle that will define him
as a competitor forever.

1511
01:27:17,363 --> 01:27:19,398
As you know,
it's Olympia weekend.

1512
01:27:19,399 --> 01:27:21,401
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

1513
01:27:21,402 --> 01:27:23,469
bodybuilding fans
from around the world,

1514
01:27:23,470 --> 01:27:27,273
welcome to the 48th edition
of the fall classic,

1515
01:27:27,274 --> 01:27:28,876
the Mr. Olympia!

1516
01:27:31,612 --> 01:27:33,779
For those
that was here last night,

1517
01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:37,450
you saw one of the most exciting
pre-judgings in Olympia history.

1518
01:27:37,451 --> 01:27:40,853
Because once again, folks, only one person
can hold the Sandow and only one man

1519
01:27:40,854 --> 01:27:43,623
will be crowned Mr. Olympia.

1520
01:27:48,929 --> 01:27:51,898
Mr. Olympia is my dream,
my life dream.

1521
01:27:51,899 --> 01:27:55,802
I can't think of anything else
that will ever happen to me again in my life

1522
01:27:56,002 --> 01:27:58,036
that will mean as much to me,
because it was nothing

1523
01:27:58,037 --> 01:28:04,943
but sheer will, determination,
and stubbornness.

1524
01:28:04,944 --> 01:28:08,480
I knew from the time I was 18
what I wanted to do in life.

1525
01:28:08,481 --> 01:28:10,049
I set goals for myself.

1526
01:28:10,050 --> 01:28:13,419
I've accomplished every goal
I set out for myself,

1527
01:28:13,420 --> 01:28:17,390
except for one,
and that's win the Mr. Olympia.

1528
01:28:19,025 --> 01:28:22,795
I'm training for this title,
I want to win this title.

1529
01:28:22,796 --> 01:28:25,831
My daughter is my biggest fan,
she's always at the Olympia,

1530
01:28:25,832 --> 01:28:29,335
she always wants to be there
and I won my first show

1531
01:28:29,336 --> 01:28:31,938
where my wife and my daughter
were together there watching us,

1532
01:28:31,939 --> 01:28:37,844
and that was amazing,
you see the girls crying,

1533
01:28:37,845 --> 01:28:40,480
because they are so happy,
it's amazing.

1534
01:28:45,819 --> 01:28:47,319
You know, in Japan,

1535
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:50,523
nobody really challenged it
before me.

1536
01:28:50,524 --> 01:28:53,693
I thought I was going to be
the first one really

1537
01:28:53,694 --> 01:28:55,827
to challenge the top.

1538
01:28:55,828 --> 01:28:57,697
I want to prove
that bodybuilding

1539
01:28:57,698 --> 01:28:59,500
is not all about size.

1540
01:29:07,291 --> 01:29:08,941
It's a dream
for every bodybuilder

1541
01:29:08,942 --> 01:29:12,479
to stand on the stage
for Mr. Olympia.

1542
01:29:13,479 --> 01:29:15,113
It was my dream.

1543
01:29:15,114 --> 01:29:18,117
It was my dream,
and I make it true.

1544
01:29:18,118 --> 01:29:20,621
Everybody can make it true
if you want it.

1545
01:29:24,725 --> 01:29:29,429
From Brooklyn, New York,
comes a predator.

1546
01:29:29,430 --> 01:29:31,032
Ladies and gentlemen,
Kai Greene!

1547
01:29:33,867 --> 01:29:38,670
When I was younger I'd leave
the cold institutional facility,

1548
01:29:38,671 --> 01:29:41,808
go to a bodybuilding show,
and I'd stand there on stage

1549
01:29:41,809 --> 01:29:46,578
with athletes, teenagers,
that had people at home

1550
01:29:46,579 --> 01:29:49,816
invested in seeing them succeed.

1551
01:29:49,817 --> 01:29:52,484
You'd hear
a very proud mom or pop,

1552
01:29:52,485 --> 01:29:55,054
sitting in the third
or fourth row

1553
01:29:55,055 --> 01:29:57,989
and then there was you,
no mom, no dad,

1554
01:29:57,990 --> 01:30:01,827
there's nobody gonna be sitting
in the audience,

1555
01:30:01,828 --> 01:30:06,131
proud of you,
but you were proud.

1556
01:30:06,132 --> 01:30:11,604
You took pleasure
in beating those guys that did.

1557
01:30:22,682 --> 01:30:26,551
He's your reigning
and current Mr. Olympia,

1558
01:30:26,552 --> 01:30:28,788
"The Gift," Phil Heath!

1559
01:30:40,868 --> 01:30:43,102
They only nitpick the best.

1560
01:30:43,103 --> 01:30:45,770
They only criticize the best.

1561
01:30:45,771 --> 01:30:46,872
They do!

1562
01:30:46,873 --> 01:30:48,444
In all sports, they do.

1563
01:30:50,144 --> 01:30:53,845
Because it's hard for someone to say, "He's
just perfect and we'll never talk about him"

1564
01:30:53,846 --> 01:30:55,515
They have to say something!

1565
01:31:40,894 --> 01:31:42,761
Did they announce it?

1566
01:31:42,762 --> 01:31:45,532
- Did they announce the Top 10?
- No.

1567
01:31:48,234 --> 01:31:49,603
I'm just gonna go.

1568
01:31:57,478 --> 01:31:59,946
As I call you out,
that means you're in the Top 10,

1569
01:31:59,947 --> 01:32:03,950
if you need to go see Pro Tan,
get greased up,

1570
01:32:03,951 --> 01:32:05,885
go down and do it,
then we'll get you up there.

1571
01:32:05,886 --> 01:32:08,086
In numeric order,
please, gentlemen,

1572
01:32:08,087 --> 01:32:10,288
Can I have Branch Warren,

1573
01:32:10,289 --> 01:32:12,090
Tony Freeman,

1574
01:32:12,091 --> 01:32:13,893
Johnnie Jackson,

1575
01:32:13,894 --> 01:32:16,127
Evan Centopani,

1576
01:32:16,128 --> 01:32:18,096
Lionel Beyeke,

1577
01:32:18,097 --> 01:32:20,166
Dexter Jackson,

1578
01:32:20,167 --> 01:32:21,968
Shawn Rhoden,

1579
01:32:21,969 --> 01:32:25,036
Dennis Wolf, Kai Greene,

1580
01:32:25,037 --> 01:32:28,073
and Phil Heath.

1581
01:32:28,074 --> 01:32:31,042
Once again, Branch, Tony,
Johnnie, Evan, Lionel,

1582
01:32:31,043 --> 01:32:34,913
Dexter, Shawn, Dennis,
Kai and Phil.

1583
01:32:34,914 --> 01:32:36,549
That's our Top 10,
thank you, gentlemen,

1584
01:32:36,550 --> 01:32:38,984
we should have you
on stage in roughly 20 minutes.

1585
01:32:38,985 --> 01:32:40,135
Roelly, sorry, brother.

1586
01:32:41,020 --> 01:32:42,554
Fuel for next year, baby!

1587
01:32:42,555 --> 01:32:43,756
Come back next year.

1588
01:32:57,270 --> 01:32:59,938
All right let's bring out
our Top 10 back on stage.

1589
01:32:59,939 --> 01:33:02,273
Gentlemen!

1590
01:33:02,274 --> 01:33:03,843
Hey, we've got one more call.

1591
01:33:03,844 --> 01:33:05,945
I need Phil and Kai back.

1592
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:14,720
That's gonna be it, group.

1593
01:33:20,827 --> 01:33:21,827
Okay, now.

1594
01:33:26,885 --> 01:33:29,135
Quarter-turn to...
no, wait, hold on, stop it.

1595
01:33:29,136 --> 01:33:32,103
No, wait, stay back
on the line both of yous.

1596
01:33:32,104 --> 01:33:35,975
And do me a favor,
take two steps to your right.

1597
01:33:42,650 --> 01:33:45,050
Do me a favor, take a step
apart from each other,

1598
01:33:45,051 --> 01:33:48,920
there's plenty of room.

1599
01:33:48,921 --> 01:33:52,191
Gotta stay on the same side, come on,
a little bit of room between yous.

1600
01:33:52,192 --> 01:33:54,326
Come on, Phil, take one more...
yup, thank you!

1601
01:33:54,327 --> 01:33:57,962
Okay, now, front.

1602
01:33:57,963 --> 01:33:59,733
Front double bicep.

1603
01:34:05,939 --> 01:34:07,841
Come on now, front double bicep.

1604
01:34:14,914 --> 01:34:17,082
And relax.

1605
01:34:17,083 --> 01:34:19,252
Relax, front lat spread.

1606
01:34:22,021 --> 01:34:23,823
Okay, both, front lat spread.

1607
01:34:27,761 --> 01:34:28,861
And relax.

1608
01:34:28,862 --> 01:34:30,930
Either side for side chest.

1609
01:34:43,777 --> 01:34:46,211
And relax.

1610
01:34:46,212 --> 01:34:47,447
Back double bicep.

1611
01:34:59,292 --> 01:35:00,760
And relax.

1612
01:35:00,761 --> 01:35:01,761
Face forward.

1613
01:35:05,164 --> 01:35:07,067
Your favorite most muscular.

1614
01:35:16,243 --> 01:35:19,344
And relax... and relax.

1615
01:35:19,345 --> 01:35:22,148
Okay, thank yous very much.

1616
01:35:22,149 --> 01:35:24,885
This concludes
our confirmation round.

1617
01:35:30,256 --> 01:35:31,756
All right folks, here we go.

1618
01:35:31,757 --> 01:35:35,461
Are we ready for the awards?

1619
01:35:35,462 --> 01:35:37,796
Aileen, please take
the sixth-place award

1620
01:35:37,797 --> 01:35:39,498
to our sixth-place finisher.

1621
01:35:43,235 --> 01:35:46,407
Dennis "Big Bad" Wolf!

1622
01:35:47,407 --> 01:35:49,407
The fifth-place award,

1623
01:35:49,408 --> 01:35:51,110
Branch Warren!

1624
01:35:56,882 --> 01:35:58,850
The fourth-place award,

1625
01:35:58,851 --> 01:36:01,519
"The Blade," Dexter Jackson!

1626
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:03,389
The third-place award,

1627
01:36:03,390 --> 01:36:06,462
"Flexatron," Shawn Rhoden.

1628
01:36:09,462 --> 01:36:12,531
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
in Olympia tradition,

1629
01:36:12,532 --> 01:36:15,534
Kai Greene, Phil Heath,
center stage, please.

1630
01:36:29,448 --> 01:36:32,284
Ladies and gentlemen,
we had a one-point decision.

1631
01:36:37,657 --> 01:36:39,892
Ladies and gentlemen,
the next name I announce

1632
01:36:39,893 --> 01:36:44,496
will be the winner
of the 2012 Mr. Olympia!

1633
01:36:44,497 --> 01:36:45,497
Come on, baby!

1634
01:36:49,069 --> 01:36:53,272
When I did find myself
in institutional placement,

1635
01:36:53,273 --> 01:36:57,546
the cold, oppressive feeling
of, like...

1636
01:37:00,546 --> 01:37:06,085
Like you don't matter
and you may never,

1637
01:37:06,086 --> 01:37:10,822
ever, ever matter again.

1638
01:37:10,823 --> 01:37:15,059
I began to talk about competing
in the Olympia one day.

1639
01:37:15,060 --> 01:37:20,532
I really did not develop Plan B.

1640
01:37:20,533 --> 01:37:25,103
But I didn't, I didn't.

1641
01:37:25,104 --> 01:37:30,509
I didn't just talk about it,
it's like...

1642
01:37:30,510 --> 01:37:33,512
I really believed
that it was gonna happen.

1643
01:37:39,051 --> 01:37:40,386
Phil Heath!

1644
01:38:13,987 --> 01:38:17,289
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Olympia, Phil Heath!

1645
01:38:19,658 --> 01:38:21,626
I didn't get any sleep,
trust me,

1646
01:38:21,627 --> 01:38:26,598
over the past 48 hours, because I knew
that these guys were all champions

1647
01:38:26,599 --> 01:38:30,234
and I knew
they were bringing it.

1648
01:38:30,235 --> 01:38:33,371
Man, it feels freakin' good
to be king up in here, man.

1649
01:38:33,372 --> 01:38:34,440
I can't even lie.

1650
01:38:36,777 --> 01:38:38,943
Did you feel nervous
for a second, like it was close?

1651
01:38:38,944 --> 01:38:40,144
Did you feel
at any point nervous?

1652
01:38:40,145 --> 01:38:41,479
I think I was
more nervous yesterday.

1653
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:43,381
'cause I felt that after
the first round,

1654
01:38:43,382 --> 01:38:45,517
I thought it was lights out,
and I kinda eased up

1655
01:38:45,518 --> 01:38:48,219
off the gas,
and that allowed allow Kai

1656
01:38:48,220 --> 01:38:51,456
to get more confidence
and to start making up

1657
01:38:51,457 --> 01:38:52,925
ground on me, and it showed.

1658
01:38:52,926 --> 01:38:54,559
I mean, I could tell.

1659
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:57,462
And it was like the power
was going to him.

1660
01:38:57,463 --> 01:39:00,566
Well, today I realized
what his game plan was,

1661
01:39:00,567 --> 01:39:03,935
and I just figured, I gotta
let it all hang out.

1662
01:39:03,936 --> 01:39:05,504
This is my town,
this is my show,

1663
01:39:05,505 --> 01:39:08,107
this is my title,
this is my throne.

1664
01:39:08,108 --> 01:39:09,675
And I refuse to give it
to anybody.

1665
01:39:09,676 --> 01:39:11,609
They're gonna have
to fight me for it.

1666
01:39:11,610 --> 01:39:14,145
I know that I pushed him
to his best look,

1667
01:39:14,146 --> 01:39:18,183
and I knew I'm gonna
go against their biggest punch,

1668
01:39:18,184 --> 01:39:21,286
but like I said,
wait till I punch back.

1669
01:39:21,287 --> 01:39:22,187
What's next for Phil Heath?

1670
01:39:22,188 --> 01:39:23,455
What are you gonna do?

1671
01:39:23,456 --> 01:39:25,124
We're gonna party tonight, man.

1672
01:39:25,125 --> 01:39:26,993
We're gonna party.

1673
01:40:16,676 --> 01:40:21,080
The title was within his grasp.

1674
01:40:21,081 --> 01:40:23,282
A point away.

1675
01:40:23,283 --> 01:40:26,453
The smell of victory
teased his nostrils.

1676
01:40:58,818 --> 01:41:02,653
You know, no one's
gonna give you anything.

1677
01:41:02,654 --> 01:41:04,460
You gonna have to work for it.

1678
01:41:07,460 --> 01:41:10,661
I didn't come there
expecting gifts.

1679
01:41:10,662 --> 01:41:12,832
I came there willing
to work for it.

1680
01:41:17,270 --> 01:41:23,075
And I believe that any man
that is willing to work hard

1681
01:41:23,076 --> 01:41:27,179
and labor long
can attain the goal,

1682
01:41:27,180 --> 01:41:28,746
as long as it's realistic.

1683
01:41:28,747 --> 01:41:31,349
I've seen enough feedback
that lets me know

1684
01:41:31,350 --> 01:41:38,756
that this is not unrealistic,
it's not impossible.

1685
01:41:38,757 --> 01:41:42,161
We got a chance
to see the champ bleed.

1686
01:41:42,162 --> 01:41:44,496
And he bled.

1687
01:41:44,497 --> 01:41:46,668
He's still bleeding.

1688
01:41:49,668 --> 01:41:53,538
Whatever can be forced to bleed
against its own will

1689
01:41:53,539 --> 01:41:57,809
can be killed, it can die,
it can be beaten

1690
01:41:57,810 --> 01:42:01,185
and you know, um...

1691
01:42:06,185 --> 01:42:10,755
We got more work to do,
you know?

1692
01:42:10,756 --> 01:42:12,625
We got more work to do.

1694
