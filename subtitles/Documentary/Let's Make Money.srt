1
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:08,818
<i>What I appreciate about India
is that it is a democracy...</i>

2
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,258
<i>...with a transparent legal system.</i>

3
00:13:11,762 --> 00:13:16,062
<i>If you buy a plot of land,
you can be sure it is yours.</i>

4
00:13:16,534 --> 00:13:18,593
<i>Nobody will take it from you
tomorrow...</i>

5
00:13:18,736 --> 00:13:22,331
<i>...by demanding new taxes
or trying to confiscate it otherwise.</i>

6
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:26,867
These are the remnants
of the colonial era.

7
00:13:29,613 --> 00:13:32,275
This legal system is
very important for me.

8
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:35,711
It's an important
investment criterion.

9
00:13:38,456 --> 00:13:39,684
We are very satisfied with it.

10
00:13:57,808 --> 00:14:00,641
<i>My name is Mirko Kovats,
I am Austrian.</i>

11
00:14:00,878 --> 00:14:04,746
<i>I built up one of the biggest
Austrian industrial groups...</i>

12
00:14:05,483 --> 00:14:06,814
<i>...over the past ten years.</i>

13
00:14:06,951 --> 00:14:09,715
Nobody is calling for the state here.

14
00:14:10,821 --> 00:14:13,187
You have to take care of yourself.

15
00:14:20,264 --> 00:14:24,325
I am always astonished
to hear discussions at home...

16
00:14:25,236 --> 00:14:27,830
...about the problems
we think we have.

17
00:14:28,406 --> 00:14:30,533
They never stop discussing...

18
00:14:30,674 --> 00:14:33,404
...how to take things away
from people by taxing them.

19
00:14:33,544 --> 00:14:35,205
All that does not count here.

20
00:14:35,346 --> 00:14:36,938
The only thing that counts here
is the economy.

21
00:14:54,565 --> 00:14:56,362
<i>My name is Sujatha Raaju.</i>

22
00:14:56,834 --> 00:15:00,634
<i>I have completed commerce studies
from the Madras University.</i>

23
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:06,508
<i>We are here in Chennai,
one of the biggest cities in India.</i>

24
00:15:06,677 --> 00:15:08,702
<i>It was formally known as Madras.</i>

25
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,680
<i>It is populated
with 8 million people.</i>

26
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:16,181
One third of the population
lead a life like this.

27
00:15:17,288 --> 00:15:20,086
That is, they live
on the banks of the rivers.

28
00:15:20,224 --> 00:15:23,387
Some of them live
even a much poorer life...

29
00:15:23,894 --> 00:15:25,521
...living on the pavements.

30
00:15:47,885 --> 00:15:51,321
In Europe students are interested
in sociology.

31
00:15:51,455 --> 00:15:53,582
Everybody wants
to become a teacher.

32
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:57,150
Here they are studying
engineering.

33
00:15:57,795 --> 00:16:00,958
<i>I ask myself who will be where
in 10 or 20 years.</i>

34
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:02,790
<i>Will they be richer?</i>

35
00:16:02,933 --> 00:16:04,400
<i>Will we be poorer?</i>

36
00:16:05,102 --> 00:16:06,535
<i>I hope not.</i>

37
00:16:19,884 --> 00:16:23,479
<i>The people
who finance the company are...</i>

38
00:16:23,821 --> 00:16:26,619
<i>- As always if you have a company
quoted on the stock market...</i>

39
00:16:26,757 --> 00:16:29,385
<i>...investors from London,
who manage the money...</i>

40
00:16:29,627 --> 00:16:33,529
<i>...in pension funds and insurances.</i>

41
00:16:36,367 --> 00:16:38,232
<i>The factory is already too small.</i>

42
00:16:38,369 --> 00:16:42,032
<i>We think about moving and
enlarging it to the fourfold size.</i>

43
00:17:11,001 --> 00:17:13,401
<i>Competition forces us
to take measures...</i>

44
00:17:14,004 --> 00:17:15,972
<i>...all very unpleasant.</i>

45
00:17:16,106 --> 00:17:20,736
<i>But we are under pressure
from globalization.</i>

46
00:17:21,478 --> 00:17:23,946
<i>We have to compete with people...</i>

47
00:17:24,381 --> 00:17:27,680
<i>...who get very small wages...</i>

48
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,446
<i>...but have to earn their living.</i>

49
00:17:32,256 --> 00:17:35,692
<i>Of course,
working hours will become longer.</i>

50
00:17:35,826 --> 00:17:41,594
<i>I am sure that this overtime
will not be paid.</i>

51
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,995
<i>It is quite simple,
we have to work more.</i>

52
00:17:45,135 --> 00:17:46,966
<i>We have no choice.</i>

53
00:17:48,305 --> 00:17:49,863
Very tidy.

54
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,843
Was this difficult to achieve?

55
00:17:55,579 --> 00:17:58,139
I had to put a lot of effort into it.

56
00:17:58,282 --> 00:18:01,274
But it works, as we see.

57
00:18:05,322 --> 00:18:07,085
I am really astonished.

58
00:18:08,592 --> 00:18:10,890
Are you having any discussions
with labour unions?

59
00:18:11,028 --> 00:18:12,791
Fortunately not, up to now.

60
00:18:13,731 --> 00:18:16,393
I try to take into account...

61
00:18:16,533 --> 00:18:18,763
...our employees' social situation.

62
00:18:18,902 --> 00:18:20,164
How much does a welder earn?

63
00:18:20,304 --> 00:18:25,469
The equivalent of
200 euros a month on average.

64
00:18:25,609 --> 00:18:27,577
That's what he earns?
Or what he costs?

65
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29,008
That is what he earns.

66
00:18:29,146 --> 00:18:31,307
He costs us about 25% more.

67
00:18:31,682 --> 00:18:33,047
250.

68
00:18:33,317 --> 00:18:34,909
What about an engineer?

69
00:18:35,219 --> 00:18:37,813
Around 8-10 times more.

70
00:18:38,422 --> 00:18:40,652
That makes 2500.

71
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:43,453
That is far below Europe...

72
00:18:43,594 --> 00:18:46,722
...but not cheap any more.

73
00:18:46,864 --> 00:18:51,699
You have to consider
the booming markets in India.

74
00:18:51,835 --> 00:18:56,238
The price increase
will not only be 3-5%...

75
00:18:56,373 --> 00:18:58,933
...but 10-15% in the next years.

76
00:18:59,076 --> 00:19:02,603
That's something
to take into account in future.

77
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,913
That means we have to be efficient.

78
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:09,213
We can't afford to be generous.

79
00:19:09,353 --> 00:19:10,411
The costs will increase.

80
00:19:10,554 --> 00:19:14,615
<i>I worked in order to minimize
the processes...</i>

81
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:17,525
...and to reduce the additional costs.

82
00:19:17,728 --> 00:19:21,164
We invested
in half automated production...

83
00:19:21,665 --> 00:19:25,761
...in order to reduce the costs
or keep them low.

84
00:20:02,673 --> 00:20:06,302
We have to buy it at any price.

85
00:20:06,443 --> 00:20:08,673
It will only become more expensive.

86
00:20:08,946 --> 00:20:11,642
The prices won't fall.

87
00:20:30,834 --> 00:20:32,392
<i>Indians pay their taxes.</i>

88
00:20:33,437 --> 00:20:36,736
<i>Taxes are collected by the government
in form of sales tax...</i>

89
00:20:36,874 --> 00:20:39,866
<i>...revenue tax, water tax,
electricity tax...</i>

90
00:20:40,244 --> 00:20:42,769
<i>...property tax
and so many other taxes...</i>

91
00:20:42,913 --> 00:20:45,143
<i>...that are collected
by the government.</i>

92
00:20:45,449 --> 00:20:48,213
<i>But this revenue
is given to foreign investors...</i>

93
00:20:48,352 --> 00:20:50,115
<i>...in the form of grants.</i>

94
00:20:50,621 --> 00:20:53,055
<i>And the government lacks
the money...</i>

95
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:56,216
<i>...to take care of the social welfare
of the people.</i>

96
00:22:46,637 --> 00:22:51,438
<i>Environmental and social standards
will not change for a long time.</i>

97
00:22:52,209 --> 00:22:55,645
The costs to raise these standards...

98
00:22:55,779 --> 00:23:00,148
...cannot be paid by countries
like India or China.

99
00:23:00,284 --> 00:23:02,684
This is reality - Like it or not.

100
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,015
The majority of people are poor.

101
00:23:06,089 --> 00:23:09,354
And they will stay poor
for a long time.

102
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,990
They have to stay competitive
at any price.

103
00:23:12,129 --> 00:23:17,066
Therefore, I think that, except
for soft declarations of good will...

104
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,637
...things won't change much
over the next decades...

105
00:23:21,772 --> 00:23:26,232
...because people can't afford it.

106
00:23:30,647 --> 00:23:32,842
<i>Flourishing economic growth
has nothing to do...</i>

107
00:23:32,983 --> 00:23:35,042
<i>...with the people or the society.</i>

108
00:23:38,088 --> 00:23:41,683
<i>Economic growth is only for
the politician, for the investor...</i>

109
00:23:41,825 --> 00:23:44,988
<i>...and for the middleman
who plays between them.</i>

110
00:23:46,229 --> 00:23:48,663
<i>10 years ago,
in a middleclass family...</i>

111
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,233
<i>...if the income of the family
was around 10000...</i>

112
00:23:51,368 --> 00:23:55,031
<i>...they were able to save
at least 2000 to 3000 rupees.</i>

113
00:23:55,172 --> 00:23:57,037
<i>But those days are gone.</i>

114
00:23:58,008 --> 00:24:00,067
<i>Today, even if they earn 20000...</i>

115
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:02,838
<i>...they are not able to save
a single penny.</i>

116
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:06,879
<i>There is a lot of foreign culture
in India...</i>

117
00:24:07,017 --> 00:24:09,042
<i>...and people are getting
accustomed to it...</i>

118
00:24:09,186 --> 00:24:13,122
<i>...following all the ways
to imitate the Western culture.</i>

119
00:24:13,624 --> 00:24:15,888
<i>But poverty
has not been eradicated.</i>

120
00:24:16,026 --> 00:24:17,960
<i>There are still poor people.</i>

121
00:24:18,528 --> 00:24:20,018
<i>This can be eradicated only...</i>

122
00:24:20,163 --> 00:24:22,654
<i>...if there is a good political system
in India.</i>

123
00:24:52,829 --> 00:24:54,456
<i>My name is Kalaiselvan.</i>

124
00:24:54,665 --> 00:24:56,963
<i>I am in the 7th class,
I am 12 years old.</i>

125
00:24:57,234 --> 00:24:59,794
<i>I have been living in the slum
Gandhinagar since I was born.</i>

126
00:24:59,936 --> 00:25:02,461
<i>When I am grown up,
I want to be a lawyer...</i>

127
00:25:03,674 --> 00:25:06,609
<i>...and I want
to fight against corruption.</i>

128
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,662
<i>My name is Gerhard Schwarz.</i>

129
00:27:48,805 --> 00:27:51,831
<i>For 14 years,
I have been chief editor...</i>

130
00:27:51,975 --> 00:27:54,910
<i>...of the economic section
of Neue Zürcher Zeitung.</i>

131
00:27:55,779 --> 00:28:00,773
<i>I also teach
at the University of Zurich.</i>

132
00:28:02,185 --> 00:28:07,316
<i>Besides, I am President...</i>

133
00:28:07,457 --> 00:28:10,949
<i>...of the Friedrich August
Hayek-Society.</i>

134
00:28:11,127 --> 00:28:15,257
<i>Friedrich August von Hayek
was certainly...</i>

135
00:28:15,398 --> 00:28:19,391
<i>...the most important liberal economist
of the 20th century.</i>

136
00:28:19,703 --> 00:28:22,103
<i>He was born in Austria...</i>

137
00:28:22,239 --> 00:28:25,902
<i>...and worked in England,
America and Germany.</i>

138
00:28:35,151 --> 00:28:39,144
<i>We are on our way from vevey
on Lake Geneva...</i>

139
00:28:39,623 --> 00:28:41,648
...to Mont Pèlerin.

140
00:28:42,425 --> 00:28:45,292
Meaning "Pilgrim's Mount".

141
00:28:45,695 --> 00:28:50,598
It is a little village
with some big hotels.

142
00:28:52,035 --> 00:28:57,268
In 1947 some of the most important...

143
00:28:57,741 --> 00:29:02,610
European and American thinkers
met here...

144
00:29:03,546 --> 00:29:07,949
...to reflect upon the future
of the Western World.

145
00:29:30,373 --> 00:29:35,310
<i>The Mont Pèlerin Society was founded
in this "Hotel du Parc".</i>

146
00:29:36,546 --> 00:29:39,674
<i>The founders' goal was
to organize...</i>

147
00:29:39,816 --> 00:29:42,182
<i>...an intellectual network.</i>

148
00:29:42,886 --> 00:29:46,287
<i>They did not want to make politics...</i>

149
00:29:46,423 --> 00:29:50,484
<i>...but wanted to influence politics
with their ideas.</i>

150
00:29:51,494 --> 00:29:56,591
<i>The Mont Pèlerin Society
became famous in the 1980s...</i>

151
00:29:56,733 --> 00:29:58,530
...with Ronald Reagan.

152
00:29:59,369 --> 00:30:02,861
In his government
and in his advisory team...

153
00:30:03,006 --> 00:30:06,908
...there was a great number of members
of the Mont Pèlerin Society.

154
00:30:08,411 --> 00:30:13,439
Sometimes 20 or even more members.

155
00:30:13,783 --> 00:30:19,346
Approximately at the same time
Margaret Thatcher...

156
00:30:20,657 --> 00:30:25,685
...drew on Hayek's ideas...

157
00:30:25,829 --> 00:30:28,889
...and the ideas of British members...

158
00:30:29,032 --> 00:30:32,263
<i>...of the Mont Pèlerin Society.</i>

159
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:48,549
<i>Here we are at the entrance
of the Sahel.</i>

160
00:34:49,892 --> 00:34:51,689
<i>All the soils are ruined.</i>

161
00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:56,230
<i>There is total erosion,
even ravines.</i>

162
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,628
<i>This is the result
of the cotton monoculture.</i>

163
00:35:03,139 --> 00:35:04,504
The cotton is gone...

164
00:35:05,375 --> 00:35:07,138
...the money for the cotton is gone.

165
00:35:08,077 --> 00:35:11,740
The only thing left is this soil,
where you can't cultivate anything.

166
00:35:13,316 --> 00:35:16,285
I am called Yves Delisle.

167
00:35:17,654 --> 00:35:19,849
I am an agronomist by profession.

168
00:35:22,125 --> 00:35:26,459
I studied
Development Studies in Geneva.

169
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:36,097
I have been working directly
with farmers for about 20 years.

170
00:35:39,008 --> 00:35:42,375
20 years is quite a long time.

171
00:35:43,313 --> 00:35:46,840
But up to now,
I have the impression...

172
00:35:46,983 --> 00:35:50,316
...that the situation
has not improved.

173
00:36:35,698 --> 00:36:40,135
<i>These people earn
not even 50 euros a year.</i>

174
00:36:59,255 --> 00:37:01,086
We are anxious!

175
00:37:01,424 --> 00:37:04,120
We are fed up.

176
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:07,593
Our children cultivate cotton,
but they don't get anything for it.

177
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:09,789
What shall we do?

178
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:12,497
We are reduced to doing nothing.
We hope for your help.

179
00:37:12,635 --> 00:37:14,193
To improve our lives.

180
00:37:14,337 --> 00:37:17,067
Go and tell those
who buy the cotton to help us...

181
00:37:17,206 --> 00:37:20,175
...to buy the cotton at a fair price.

182
00:37:20,309 --> 00:37:24,837
So that Burkina and we
get more money.

183
00:37:26,048 --> 00:37:29,540
Old women like me work the whole
day long under the sun. For nothing.

184
00:37:30,353 --> 00:37:31,843
But what can we do?

185
00:37:31,954 --> 00:37:34,013
Try to understand us.

186
00:37:34,891 --> 00:37:36,791
We beg you.

187
00:37:37,393 --> 00:37:38,883
You see how tiring the work is.

188
00:37:39,028 --> 00:37:41,861
If we managed to pay back
our loans, we would be glad.

189
00:38:19,135 --> 00:38:21,933
<i>The quality of cotton is the best
in the world.</i>

190
00:38:22,405 --> 00:38:25,340
<i>The production costs
are the lowest.</i>

191
00:38:25,875 --> 00:38:29,106
<i>The cotton is clean,
because all is done by hand.</i>

192
00:38:31,047 --> 00:38:34,278
<i>Nevertheless, the price is very low
on the world market.</i>

193
00:39:30,039 --> 00:39:34,669
<i>Every year, the USA subsidize
their cotton producers...</i>

194
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:37,040
<i>...with $3 billion.</i>

195
00:39:37,547 --> 00:39:40,107
If the Americans are liberal,
so be it!

196
00:39:40,249 --> 00:39:42,183
<i>But why do they subsidize
their cotton producers?</i>

197
00:39:43,553 --> 00:39:45,020
This isn't liberalism!

198
00:39:45,154 --> 00:39:46,781
In reality,
they practise protectionism...

199
00:39:46,923 --> 00:39:48,618
...and impose liberalism on us.

200
00:39:49,325 --> 00:39:50,485
They apply two different standards!

201
00:39:50,626 --> 00:39:53,060
It is like if you have a football field
and two teams.

202
00:39:53,195 --> 00:39:58,531
Team A has the best shoes
and can also use their hands.

203
00:39:58,668 --> 00:40:02,229
Team B - And these are the Africans,
and small countries like us...

204
00:40:02,371 --> 00:40:05,636
...have to play
without shoes or hands.

205
00:40:05,775 --> 00:40:07,436
Do you consider this
to be normal?

206
00:40:34,503 --> 00:40:38,269
<i>In the 1980s the World Bank imposed...</i>

207
00:40:38,407 --> 00:40:41,171
<i>...restructuring programmes
on Burkina Faso.</i>

208
00:40:41,677 --> 00:40:43,668
<i>What does this mean for the country?</i>

209
00:40:44,947 --> 00:40:46,676
<i>Raw materials are exported...</i>

210
00:40:47,216 --> 00:40:49,514
<i>...cotton in the form of raw cotton...</i>

211
00:40:49,652 --> 00:40:50,914
<i>...without added value.</i>

212
00:40:54,323 --> 00:40:58,020
<i>All the World Bank and the investors
are interested in...</i>

213
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,755
<i>...is sucking raw materials
out of the country.</i>

214
00:41:02,198 --> 00:41:06,601
<i>Cotton, timber, coffee, cacao, gold,
and so on.</i>

215
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:11,364
<i>In the past, the colonialists forced us
to cultivate a certain product.</i>

216
00:41:12,208 --> 00:41:15,541
<i>Now the World Bank
puts us under pressure...</i>

217
00:41:15,678 --> 00:41:19,170
<i>...with money to plant cotton.</i>

218
00:41:34,296 --> 00:41:36,662
<i>How can you buy medicine?</i>

219
00:41:38,334 --> 00:41:40,199
<i>You need foreign currency.</i>

220
00:41:40,336 --> 00:41:43,430
<i>The cotton can bring us
this foreign currency.</i>

221
00:41:45,007 --> 00:41:50,035
<i>I told you that cotton makes the living
of two million people - Directly.</i>

222
00:41:50,179 --> 00:41:52,238
<i>But if you calculate that in Africa...</i>

223
00:41:52,381 --> 00:41:57,318
<i>...every person supports
another 15 people...</i>

224
00:41:57,453 --> 00:41:59,887
<i>...multiply by 2 million...</i>

225
00:42:00,022 --> 00:42:03,150
<i>...and you quickly realize that
the whole population lives off cotton.</i>

226
00:42:04,627 --> 00:42:07,824
<i>If the USA did not subsidize
their cotton...</i>

227
00:42:08,464 --> 00:42:11,160
<i>Burkina Faso would make profits...</i>

228
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,630
<i>...of at least 80 billion CFA a year.</i>

229
00:42:15,905 --> 00:42:17,896
<i>The bilateral aid...</i>

230
00:42:18,708 --> 00:42:21,336
<i>...the credits from the EU...</i>

231
00:42:21,477 --> 00:42:23,468
<i>USA and Japan...</i>

232
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:27,106
...represent altogether only
20 billion CFA.

233
00:42:27,249 --> 00:42:30,412
You see, we would not need to get
into debt to develop our country!

234
00:42:30,753 --> 00:42:32,914
The work of the farmers alone
would permit us...

235
00:42:33,222 --> 00:42:34,814
...to construct schools and roads...

236
00:42:35,124 --> 00:42:38,491
...in order to give a better future
to our children.

237
00:42:39,328 --> 00:42:43,560
This is the dilemma we are facing
with the cotton production today.

238
00:43:27,777 --> 00:43:32,908
<i>Here you see women
sweeping the soil.</i>

239
00:43:34,817 --> 00:43:37,513
<i>They sell the soil or pebbles...</i>

240
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,687
<i>...in order to earn
a little bit of money.</i>

241
00:43:45,561 --> 00:43:47,324
<i>According to the
UN development program...</i>

242
00:43:47,463 --> 00:43:49,363
<i>...there are only 3 poorer countries.</i>

243
00:43:51,567 --> 00:43:53,626
62% of the population...

244
00:43:53,769 --> 00:43:57,205
...has less than 1 dollar per day
to live on.

245
00:43:57,339 --> 00:43:59,603
Among these 62%, a large part...

246
00:44:00,409 --> 00:44:04,038
...is living in destitution.

247
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:07,377
That is even worse than poverty.

248
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,949
40% of the children
don't go to school.

249
00:44:15,691 --> 00:44:17,682
Out of those
who begin to go to school...

250
00:44:17,827 --> 00:44:19,795
...only 1-2% reach university.

251
00:44:23,432 --> 00:44:26,868
Life expectancy here is 42 years.

252
00:44:30,806 --> 00:44:33,775
<i>Speaking about misery,
you have to notice...</i>

253
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:38,703
<i>...that the most destitute social group
are women and children.</i>

254
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:44,285
<i>Some women go to the quarries.</i>

255
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,681
<i>In that way they can earn...</i>

256
00:44:46,822 --> 00:44:48,949
<i>...about 50 euro cents per day.</i>

257
00:48:33,248 --> 00:48:34,875
<i>We have many debts.</i>

258
00:48:35,451 --> 00:48:38,545
<i>Every Burkinan born today
is already deeply in debt.</i>

259
00:48:38,854 --> 00:48:42,847
<i>Even those who are born
in 25 years already debts.</i>

260
00:48:43,292 --> 00:48:45,954
<i>If we don't produce cotton...</i>

261
00:48:47,162 --> 00:48:51,531
<i>...every African living in Burkina...</i>

262
00:48:51,767 --> 00:48:55,533
<i>...but also those living in Mali,
Benin and other countries...</i>

263
00:48:56,238 --> 00:48:58,536
<i>...will emigrate to Europe.</i>

264
00:48:59,141 --> 00:49:02,975
<i>We will have no choice but to go.
We will invade you, sure enough.</i>

265
00:49:03,512 --> 00:49:07,949
<i>But if the West doesn't stop
subsidizing their cotton...</i>

266
00:49:08,083 --> 00:49:09,812
...we will be forced to go.

267
00:49:09,952 --> 00:49:11,783
If we go...

268
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,287
...they can construct
walls 10 meters high...

269
00:49:16,158 --> 00:49:18,092
...we will nevertheless come to Europe.

270
00:49:34,843 --> 00:49:39,507
<i>All liberals in the world think
that frontiers should be open...</i>

271
00:49:39,648 --> 00:49:40,808
<i>...for goods...</i>

272
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:44,141
<i>...money and services.</i>

273
00:49:44,953 --> 00:49:47,581
<i>It becomes more complicated
if people are concerned.</i>

274
00:49:48,323 --> 00:49:50,791
You have to think about...

275
00:49:50,926 --> 00:49:53,224
...introducing
membership fees...

276
00:49:54,163 --> 00:49:57,599
...as you demand membership fees
in a club.

277
00:49:57,966 --> 00:50:00,696
If you become a member
of a tennis club...

278
00:50:00,903 --> 00:50:05,340
...you have to pay membership fees...

279
00:50:05,474 --> 00:50:09,240
...not only monthly...

280
00:50:09,378 --> 00:50:11,539
...or annual fees like taxes.

281
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:16,276
This is because
the predecessors built...

282
00:50:16,418 --> 00:50:18,750
...the club house
and prepared the place.

283
00:50:18,887 --> 00:50:23,847
Otherwise
the newcomer would profit...

284
00:50:23,992 --> 00:50:26,290
...from something
he did not contribute to.

285
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:03,020
<i>20 years ago...</i>

286
00:51:04,066 --> 00:51:08,093
<i>...the financial groups,
banks and investors...</i>

287
00:51:09,104 --> 00:51:11,197
<i>...began to make a grab...</i>

288
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:15,640
<i>...for public goods.</i>

289
00:51:16,445 --> 00:51:20,973
<i>Goods actually belonging
to the state...</i>

290
00:51:22,417 --> 00:51:25,614
<i>...and to the citizens,
who have to regularly...</i>

291
00:51:25,754 --> 00:51:29,656
<i>...pay their rent, water rates, etc.</i>

292
00:51:35,297 --> 00:51:37,629
<i>That is the whole point
of privatization.</i>

293
00:51:40,269 --> 00:51:44,501
We are sitting in
a public transport tram in Vienna.

294
00:51:45,173 --> 00:51:49,371
<i>Every citizen assumes...</i>

295
00:51:49,511 --> 00:51:52,071
...that the trams belong
to the City of Vienna.

296
00:51:52,981 --> 00:51:55,609
But this is not the case.

297
00:51:56,585 --> 00:52:01,989
This tram belongs
to an American investor.

298
00:52:08,397 --> 00:52:13,926
Some years ago, the City Council
of Vienna decided...

299
00:52:15,203 --> 00:52:21,108
...to sell its trams
to American investors.

300
00:52:22,377 --> 00:52:25,403
They got a lot of money for them...

301
00:52:25,547 --> 00:52:27,276
...more than $1 billion.

302
00:52:27,416 --> 00:52:30,510
But the City of Vienna
never received that money.

303
00:52:30,986 --> 00:52:33,750
Instead, the money was transferred...

304
00:52:33,889 --> 00:52:37,086
...to banks in England and elsewhere.

305
00:52:37,893 --> 00:52:39,292
They took the money...

306
00:52:39,428 --> 00:52:44,730
...and for years to come will pay...

307
00:52:44,866 --> 00:52:50,270
...periodic leasing instalments
to the American investor...

308
00:52:50,405 --> 00:52:53,772
...so that the City of Vienna
has the right...

309
00:52:53,909 --> 00:52:55,342
...to use the trams.

310
00:52:56,745 --> 00:52:58,178
<i>Can you imagine that?</i>

311
00:53:12,394 --> 00:53:16,353
<i>The state is the community
of all people living in that state.</i>

312
00:53:16,498 --> 00:53:18,295
<i>We are the state.</i>

313
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:21,296
<i>This applies at least
to a democracy.</i>

314
00:53:21,536 --> 00:53:24,198
<i>In order to organize
a functioning society...</i>

315
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:26,163
<i>...the state needs public goods...</i>

316
00:53:26,675 --> 00:53:28,973
<i>Schools, universities...</i>

317
00:53:29,111 --> 00:53:32,603
<i>...public transport, etc.</i>

318
00:53:33,115 --> 00:53:35,481
<i>In this context,
it is interesting to see...</i>

319
00:53:35,617 --> 00:53:39,644
<i>...what is going on
with privatization.</i>

320
00:53:40,088 --> 00:53:43,319
<i>" Privatization" originates
from the Latin word "privare"</i>

321
00:53:43,458 --> 00:53:45,085
...which means "to deprive".

322
00:53:47,028 --> 00:53:49,189
<i>In the process
of privatization...</i>

323
00:53:49,498 --> 00:53:51,295
...public goods
are bought...

324
00:53:52,601 --> 00:53:55,263
...by private investors.

325
00:53:55,904 --> 00:53:59,135
Sometimes they even receive them
as a present.

326
00:53:59,641 --> 00:54:02,075
This is nothing else...

327
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:05,702
...than depriving society
of public goods.

328
00:54:06,314 --> 00:54:08,544
You could sum it up as follows:

329
00:54:08,683 --> 00:54:11,584
Society is deprived of a certain good...

330
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:17,158
...that the private investor
is interested in...

331
00:54:17,292 --> 00:54:19,317
...for reasons of profit.

332
00:54:38,113 --> 00:54:42,447
<i>This strange system called
"cross-border-leasing"</i>

333
00:54:42,584 --> 00:54:44,449
<i>...has been widely applied...</i>

334
00:54:44,586 --> 00:54:48,852
<i>...not only in the case
of the viennese trams.</i>

335
00:54:49,157 --> 00:54:52,957
The Austrian Federal Railways...

336
00:54:53,094 --> 00:54:57,690
...sold their trains
to American investors.

337
00:54:59,167 --> 00:55:03,365
The City of Innsbruck
sold its public utilities.

338
00:55:05,273 --> 00:55:08,902
<i>Since we live in the era
of globalization...</i>

339
00:55:09,044 --> 00:55:11,774
...this didn't only take place in Austria...

340
00:55:11,913 --> 00:55:15,405
...but also in Germany, the Netherlands
and everywhere in Europe.

341
00:55:16,017 --> 00:55:20,147
The fact that politicians sanction
a cross-border-system...

342
00:55:20,288 --> 00:55:24,952
...is sometimes due to ignorance.

343
00:55:25,694 --> 00:55:27,685
Those who understand...

344
00:55:28,296 --> 00:55:32,027
...care only about the very
short period of their career.

345
00:55:32,167 --> 00:55:34,362
They are not interested
in what happens after them.

346
00:55:34,503 --> 00:55:38,496
This short-term attitude...

347
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:42,974
...the lack of a will to take
responsibility for the long term...

348
00:55:43,111 --> 00:55:47,275
- Knowing it will be up to others
to resolve the problems later...

349
00:55:47,415 --> 00:55:51,044
...is characteristic
of the neo-liberal era.

350
00:55:51,286 --> 00:55:53,186
In the neo-liberal era...

351
00:55:53,321 --> 00:55:56,813
...everything is reduced...

352
00:55:58,193 --> 00:56:04,894
...to making the highest profits
immediately.

353
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,234
And this at any price.

354
01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:41,751
<i>Over the past 10-15 years...</i>

355
01:07:42,363 --> 01:07:45,059
<i>...a dramatic change
in the distribution of incomes...</i>

356
01:07:45,199 --> 01:07:46,996
<i>...took place due to globalization.</i>

357
01:07:48,069 --> 01:07:53,063
<i>Millions of
blue and white collar workers...</i>

358
01:07:53,207 --> 01:07:55,539
<i>...had their earnings under pressure.</i>

359
01:07:55,676 --> 01:07:59,203
<i>They no longer got
the wages they demanded.</i>

360
01:07:59,347 --> 01:08:05,047
<i>Globalization made them work for less.</i>

361
01:08:05,486 --> 01:08:09,684
<i>That led to a considerable shift
of incomes...</i>

362
01:08:09,824 --> 01:08:11,951
<i>...in favour of capital.</i>

363
01:08:18,266 --> 01:08:23,670
<i>This huge quantity of money
had to be invested.</i>

364
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:30,536
<i>That led to a dramatic abortive
development.</i>

365
01:08:31,912 --> 01:08:34,540
<i>A new industry emerged...</i>

366
01:08:35,416 --> 01:08:37,441
<i>...financial services,:</i>

367
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:40,048
<i>...investment bankers,:</i>

368
01:08:40,187 --> 01:08:42,678
<i>...private equity funds,:
hedge funds.</i>

369
01:08:44,825 --> 01:08:48,192
<i>This new industry
is a phenomenon...</i>

370
01:08:48,329 --> 01:08:53,266
<i>It earns piles of money,
not by staking its own money...</i>

371
01:08:54,935 --> 01:08:58,769
<i>...but by staking foreign money.</i>

372
01:09:00,107 --> 01:09:03,474
<i>For each dollar and euro
that is invested...</i>

373
01:09:03,611 --> 01:09:05,340
<i>...they get a commission.</i>

374
01:09:11,185 --> 01:09:15,178
Cologne is in a privileged situation
on the Rhine.

375
01:09:18,359 --> 01:09:20,224
<i>My name is Anton Schneider.</i>

376
01:09:20,928 --> 01:09:24,420
<i>I am partner in a small
private equity fund.</i>

377
01:09:24,632 --> 01:09:29,365
<i>That means
we collect our investors' capital.</i>

378
01:09:29,503 --> 01:09:33,098
<i>We invest it
together with our money...</i>

379
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:37,768
<i>...in enterprises we restructure
and sell afterwards.</i>

380
01:09:38,279 --> 01:09:42,215
<i>The private equity industry
is at the centre of attention...</i>

381
01:09:42,383 --> 01:09:45,750
<i>...because normally
we buy enterprises...</i>

382
01:09:45,953 --> 01:09:48,751
<i>...with rather low equity capital.</i>

383
01:09:48,889 --> 01:09:51,790
<i>The purchase price
is mainly financed by debts.</i>

384
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:56,389
These debts are merged
with the enterprise.

385
01:09:56,597 --> 01:10:00,124
That way, the enterprises
which have been bought...

386
01:10:00,368 --> 01:10:02,563
...have to service huge debts.

387
01:10:03,137 --> 01:10:07,267
They do not have much money
left for investments.

388
01:10:07,975 --> 01:10:10,273
That works as long as
the economy is good...

389
01:10:10,411 --> 01:10:14,245
...as long as there are high profits.

390
01:10:14,382 --> 01:10:16,714
As long as there is
no economic downturn.

391
01:10:16,851 --> 01:10:19,684
As long as the enterprises...

392
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:25,315
...have made enough
previous investments.

393
01:10:25,593 --> 01:10:27,993
But in many cases,
it does not work out.

394
01:10:28,129 --> 01:10:32,259
The purchase prices
have increased incredibly.

395
01:10:32,967 --> 01:10:35,128
They were financed...

396
01:10:35,269 --> 01:10:37,635
...with a huge amount
of outside capital.

397
01:10:37,805 --> 01:10:40,137
The risk is that the enterprises...

398
01:10:40,274 --> 01:10:42,208
...cannot pay back their debts.

399
01:10:43,411 --> 01:10:46,209
In that case, the banks
must write off the credits.

400
01:10:46,347 --> 01:10:50,340
The enterprises are fleeced of
their money for years.

401
01:10:50,885 --> 01:10:53,854
So they can't do
what they are supposed to do:

402
01:10:53,988 --> 01:10:57,480
Develop products, invest,
create new jobs.

403
01:10:58,092 --> 01:11:01,960
<i>That is why
they are called "Locusts".</i>

404
01:11:02,096 --> 01:11:04,223
<i>Unfortunately, I think
this is precisely the right term.</i>

405
01:11:08,402 --> 01:11:12,133
The whole financial system
increased in importance.

406
01:11:12,506 --> 01:11:14,872
And that happened for 2 reasons:

407
01:11:15,643 --> 01:11:18,806
First, those who possess the capital
become ever greedier.

408
01:11:18,979 --> 01:11:21,743
Second, the managers of the capital...

409
01:11:21,882 --> 01:11:24,680
...get commissions.

410
01:11:24,819 --> 01:11:30,314
The riskier
the investment forms are...

411
01:11:30,458 --> 01:11:33,950
...the more they profit
from the operation.

412
01:12:56,343 --> 01:12:57,435
<i>Hello.</i>

413
01:12:58,946 --> 01:13:01,881
<i>Welcome to the El Algarrobico Hotel.</i>

414
01:13:02,349 --> 01:13:05,045
<i>We are in Spain, in Andalusia...</i>

415
01:13:05,185 --> 01:13:06,812
...in Almeria...

416
01:13:06,954 --> 01:13:09,013
...in the village
of Carboneras.

417
01:13:09,290 --> 01:13:11,952
The hotel is situated...

418
01:13:12,092 --> 01:13:16,119
...in the National Park
of Cabo de Gata...

419
01:13:16,263 --> 01:13:19,391
...beginning in the west over there.

420
01:13:19,833 --> 01:13:24,668
This is an important marine
and terrestrial reserve.

421
01:13:29,209 --> 01:13:32,838
We are fighting for the preservation
of the biosphere...

422
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:35,710
...of the climate and fresh air...

423
01:13:35,849 --> 01:13:37,510
...and for the preservation
of the species...

424
01:13:37,651 --> 01:13:39,642
...living on land and in the sea.

425
01:13:40,554 --> 01:13:44,251
<i>This hotel is an important project.</i>

426
01:13:57,504 --> 01:14:00,337
<i>This hotel is the first
of seven hotels...</i>

427
01:14:00,474 --> 01:14:04,410
<i>...foreseen for this region.</i>

428
01:14:04,545 --> 01:14:08,140
<i>In addition to this,
we want to build a golf-course...</i>

429
01:14:08,282 --> 01:14:11,740
<i>...and a limited number of flats.</i>

430
01:14:11,885 --> 01:14:15,082
In the first phase,
we will construct 500 flats.

431
01:14:15,222 --> 01:14:19,181
Later there will be 1500 flats
and houses.

432
01:14:36,844 --> 01:14:38,368
<i>My name is Miguel Angel Torres.</i>

433
01:14:39,113 --> 01:14:41,809
<i>I am a public servant
and cartographer.</i>

434
01:14:43,183 --> 01:14:46,778
<i>For 18 years
I have been observing...</i>

435
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:48,888
<i>...the construction of buildings...</i>

436
01:14:49,023 --> 01:14:50,820
<i>...on the "Costa del Sol".</i>

437
01:14:53,193 --> 01:14:54,785
This is the "Parque Victoria".

438
01:14:54,928 --> 01:14:57,488
They are constructing 4000 flats.

439
01:14:58,232 --> 01:15:02,328
Mostly, they are built
as capital investments.

440
01:15:03,637 --> 01:15:06,800
That way the real estate societies...

441
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:09,909
...enterprises and European banks...

442
01:15:10,044 --> 01:15:13,138
...can reckon with an annual profit...

443
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:16,841
...of about 20%.

444
01:15:16,984 --> 01:15:20,476
A traditional investment in a bank
or at the stock exchange...

445
01:15:20,621 --> 01:15:23,317
...brings a profit of only 5-6%.

446
01:15:24,124 --> 01:15:28,083
Therefore the buildings here
and on the Spanish coast...

447
01:15:28,929 --> 01:15:32,330
...are not built for living in...

448
01:15:32,466 --> 01:15:34,161
...not even during the holidays.

449
01:15:34,301 --> 01:15:37,532
They are just built in order
to launch an investment chain.

450
01:15:41,542 --> 01:15:43,476
<i>After the whole process...</i>

451
01:15:43,610 --> 01:15:46,670
<i>...we will have thousands...</i>

452
01:15:46,814 --> 01:15:48,907
<i>...of empty flats...</i>

453
01:15:49,049 --> 01:15:53,281
<i>...which profited people
we don't know...</i>

454
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:55,217
<i>...and who don't even live here.</i>

455
01:17:41,795 --> 01:17:44,696
<i>If you have a pension fund
at a European bank...</i>

456
01:17:44,832 --> 01:17:47,995
...it is likely that
the money is invested...

457
01:17:48,135 --> 01:17:49,762
...in one of these housing estates
in Spain.

458
01:17:49,903 --> 01:17:52,371
These flats,
which are already sold...

459
01:17:52,506 --> 01:17:55,168
<i>...are empty the whole year long.</i>

460
01:17:57,010 --> 01:18:01,640
<i>Young Spanish people
can't buy these flats.</i>

461
01:18:03,450 --> 01:18:06,146
<i>The cost of these apartments
are much higher...</i>

462
01:18:06,286 --> 01:18:08,083
<i>...than anything they can afford.</i>

463
01:18:12,259 --> 01:18:14,489
The upkeep of these buildings...

464
01:18:14,661 --> 01:18:16,561
...which are of very poor quality...

465
01:18:16,730 --> 01:18:18,664
...the water and the utilities...

466
01:18:18,799 --> 01:18:20,960
...are paid by the Spanish state.

467
01:18:21,335 --> 01:18:26,136
We have no advantage whatsoever...

468
01:18:26,273 --> 01:18:29,834
...from the 800000 flats
built every year in Spain.

469
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:04,169
<i>Spain is one of the countries
in the world...</i>

470
01:19:04,311 --> 01:19:06,779
<i>...where the bubble
in the real estate market...</i>

471
01:19:06,914 --> 01:19:11,510
<i>...became most apparent
over the past five years.</i>

472
01:19:12,753 --> 01:19:16,519
<i>A real storm of urbanization...</i>

473
01:19:16,657 --> 01:19:21,560
<i>...a "cement-tsunami" is ruining
the Spanish coasts and islands.</i>

474
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:10,974
<i>Here we can see one
of the housing estates...</i>

475
01:20:11,111 --> 01:20:13,875
...all of them are connected
to golf courses.

476
01:20:14,348 --> 01:20:18,284
There are hundreds
of such estates in Spain...

477
01:20:18,418 --> 01:20:21,512
...a country where...

478
01:20:21,655 --> 01:20:26,024
...only very few people
play golf, a tiny minority.

479
01:20:27,995 --> 01:20:30,054
<i>How is this possible?</i>

480
01:20:30,964 --> 01:20:34,422
<i>This is due to the big
foreign investments...</i>

481
01:20:34,568 --> 01:20:37,594
<i>...in products of this type.</i>

482
01:20:37,738 --> 01:20:41,572
<i>The value of these real estate
buildings is higher...</i>

483
01:20:41,708 --> 01:20:43,699
<i>...if they are located
beside a golf course.</i>

484
01:21:22,282 --> 01:21:26,446
This is absolutely artificial.

485
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:30,380
We are creating a green space...

486
01:21:30,590 --> 01:21:32,421
...in the midst of the desert.

487
01:21:32,559 --> 01:21:34,493
To do so,
we need a huge quantity of water.

488
01:21:35,996 --> 01:21:38,556
<i>A golf course of this type...</i>

489
01:21:38,698 --> 01:21:41,895
<i>...consumes the same quantity
of water...</i>

490
01:21:42,035 --> 01:21:44,902
<i>...as a town of 20000 inhabitants.</i>

491
01:22:32,018 --> 01:22:35,078
<i>7 of the 11 most important
construction companies...</i>

492
01:22:35,222 --> 01:22:37,190
<i>...in the world are Spanish.</i>

493
01:22:37,324 --> 01:22:41,590
<i>Some of them are linked
to big soccer clubs.</i>

494
01:22:41,895 --> 01:22:46,093
<i>The biggest Spanish
construction company ACS</i>

495
01:22:46,233 --> 01:22:49,566
<i>...is directed by the former president
of Real Madrid.</i>

496
01:23:04,317 --> 01:23:06,945
<i>The extent of construction
has reached its limits.</i>

497
01:23:09,055 --> 01:23:11,785
<i>Of the first kilometer
of the whole Spanish coastline...</i>

498
01:23:11,925 --> 01:23:14,519
<i>80% is covered with buildings.</i>

499
01:23:14,661 --> 01:23:18,290
<i>They are beginning to occupy
the last natural spaces.</i>

500
01:23:25,772 --> 01:23:27,205
<i>At the moment...</i>

501
01:23:27,340 --> 01:23:30,002
...the construction works
are temporarily halted...

502
01:23:30,143 --> 01:23:33,374
...because our activities
have been reported...

503
01:23:33,513 --> 01:23:36,141
...to the authorities
by an ecological group...

504
01:23:36,283 --> 01:23:40,117
...claiming that we don't have...

505
01:23:40,253 --> 01:23:42,813
<i>...the necessary permits.</i>

506
01:23:45,759 --> 01:23:47,727
<i>I hope and I wish that the judge...</i>

507
01:23:47,861 --> 01:23:51,024
<i>...after having confirmed the legality
of the construction...</i>

508
01:23:51,164 --> 01:23:54,327
<i>...will soon allow us
to finish building this hotel...</i>

509
01:23:54,467 --> 01:23:56,560
<i>...for which we already have...</i>

510
01:23:56,703 --> 01:24:00,969
<i>...reservations from all over Europe.</i>

511
01:24:30,971 --> 01:24:34,873
<i>The building sector
recruits its workers...</i>

512
01:24:35,141 --> 01:24:37,132
<i>...mainly among immigrants.</i>

513
01:24:37,978 --> 01:24:42,972
<i>The people coming from
Africa or South America...</i>

514
01:24:43,116 --> 01:24:45,983
<i>...work for the lowest wages.</i>

515
01:24:47,053 --> 01:24:49,988
<i>This way, the people
in the construction sector...</i>

516
01:24:50,123 --> 01:24:53,251
<i>...spend their black money...</i>

517
01:24:53,493 --> 01:24:55,961
<i>...on paying
their construction workers.</i>

518
01:26:40,734 --> 01:26:42,759
Why doesn't anybody do something...

519
01:26:42,902 --> 01:26:46,394
...about this abortive development
of the financial system?

520
01:26:47,207 --> 01:26:49,266
This question is difficult to answer...

521
01:26:49,409 --> 01:26:52,606
...since many are suffering from it...

522
01:26:52,746 --> 01:26:56,273
...including the national economy,
because there is the risk...

523
01:26:56,416 --> 01:26:58,577
...of a new global economic crisis.

524
01:26:58,718 --> 01:27:00,549
Despite of all this,
nothing is happening.

525
01:27:00,687 --> 01:27:03,281
Even now, one year
after the financial crisis...

526
01:27:03,423 --> 01:27:05,118
...there aren't any new regulations.

527
01:27:05,592 --> 01:27:08,755
That way, these financial excesses
are permitted.

528
01:27:08,895 --> 01:27:11,420
On the contrary,
they allocated public money...

529
01:27:11,598 --> 01:27:15,864
...from the bank of issue to the system...

530
01:27:16,002 --> 01:27:18,197
...so that the system won't collapse.

531
01:27:18,805 --> 01:27:22,104
That means they use
ordinary people's money...

532
01:27:22,242 --> 01:27:24,301
...to cover the bets.

533
01:27:25,378 --> 01:27:29,144
In order to provide a basis
for the gamblers...

534
01:27:29,749 --> 01:27:32,411
...who bleed the system...

535
01:27:33,486 --> 01:27:38,082
...so that their institutes
don't go bankrupt.

536
01:27:52,839 --> 01:27:54,773
<i>It seems that time after time...</i>

537
01:27:54,908 --> 01:27:58,639
<i>...catastrophes overtake humanity.</i>

538
01:27:59,412 --> 01:28:01,437
<i>After each catastrophe...</i>

539
01:28:01,581 --> 01:28:03,606
<i>...the rules are newly defined...</i>

540
01:28:03,783 --> 01:28:05,512
<i>...in order to avoid such catastrophes.</i>

541
01:28:06,553 --> 01:28:08,020
<i>After the world economic crisis...</i>

542
01:28:08,154 --> 01:28:11,021
<i>...completely new rules for banks
were introduced.</i>

543
01:28:11,458 --> 01:28:14,586
<i>The whole banking system
was highly regulated...</i>

544
01:28:14,727 --> 01:28:21,530
<i>...to avoid something like
the world economic crisis.</i>

545
01:28:25,071 --> 01:28:29,007
<i>Over the past years, a new
attitude has become established...</i>

546
01:28:29,142 --> 01:28:31,838
<i>...purporting that we don't need
to regulate anything...</i>

547
01:28:31,978 --> 01:28:34,242
<i>...because that the market
regulates everything.</i>

548
01:28:35,114 --> 01:28:38,208
<i>So the public control authorities
have tolerated...</i>

549
01:28:38,785 --> 01:28:42,619
<i>...that for the financial system
regulations no longer exist.</i>

550
01:28:43,857 --> 01:28:46,325
<i>Everything has been
completely liberalized.</i>

551
01:28:47,627 --> 01:28:50,562
<i>The sort of financial industry
we have today...</i>

552
01:28:50,697 --> 01:28:53,598
<i>...is completely senseless
and directed against people.</i>

553
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:22,291
<i>It's the media...</i>

554
01:29:22,428 --> 01:29:24,760
...that choose today's leaders.

555
01:29:24,898 --> 01:29:27,492
They give thumbs up or down.

556
01:29:28,434 --> 01:29:30,800
So people are eager
to please the media...

557
01:29:32,205 --> 01:29:36,141
...they try to be in the limelight.

558
01:29:36,409 --> 01:29:39,344
They are elected less and less...

559
01:29:39,479 --> 01:29:41,845
...due to serious political concepts.

560
01:29:46,486 --> 01:29:48,420
<i>This capacity to please the media...</i>

561
01:29:48,555 --> 01:29:53,288
<i>...has become a crucial criterion
for a political leader...</i>

562
01:29:53,793 --> 01:29:58,025
<i>...although it is the exact opposite
of the qualities...</i>

563
01:29:58,364 --> 01:30:00,832
...you need to be
a good political leader.

564
01:30:00,967 --> 01:30:04,130
So we have
more and more dummies...

565
01:30:05,338 --> 01:30:09,399
...who take crucial political decisions...

566
01:30:10,410 --> 01:30:13,743
...and who very quickly
become compliant puppets...

567
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:17,077
...of developments determined
by other people.

568
01:38:33,512 --> 01:38:35,241
<i>Our opinion
in Switzerland...</i>

569
01:38:35,381 --> 01:38:37,542
<i>...is that it is
of the utmost importance...</i>

570
01:38:37,683 --> 01:38:39,082
<i>...to protect a person's privacy.</i>

571
01:38:40,519 --> 01:38:44,751
<i>This protection is part
of a liberal economy.</i>

572
01:38:45,191 --> 01:38:48,957
<i>This protection
may only be suspended...</i>

573
01:38:49,128 --> 01:38:52,222
<i>...in the case
of major legal infractions.</i>

574
01:38:52,565 --> 01:38:57,366
<i>Tax avoidance is considered
an infraction...</i>

575
01:38:57,503 --> 01:39:01,132
<i>...but not serious enough...</i>

576
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:04,000
<i>...to suspend privacy.</i>

577
01:39:04,610 --> 01:39:08,478
<i>Neither that of our own citizens,
nor that of foreign citizens.</i>

578
01:39:11,550 --> 01:39:14,986
<i>Switzerland would never
exclusively protect...</i>

579
01:39:15,121 --> 01:39:19,182
<i>...its own citizens
from tax authorities...</i>

580
01:39:19,325 --> 01:39:22,590
<i>...but on the slightest suspicion...</i>

581
01:39:22,761 --> 01:39:24,592
<i>...of tax evasion...</i>

582
01:39:24,730 --> 01:39:26,823
<i>...or tax avoidance...</i>

583
01:39:26,966 --> 01:39:32,871
<i>...suspend foreign citizens' privacy.</i>

584
01:42:42,461 --> 01:42:45,487
<i>The Universal Declaration
of Human Rights stipulates...</i>

585
01:42:46,131 --> 01:42:50,864
<i>"All human beings are born free
and equal in dignity and rights. "</i>

586
01:42:51,503 --> 01:42:54,597
<i>If we want to stick to
this humanitarian principle...</i>

587
01:42:54,740 --> 01:42:58,972
<i>...the distribution of wealth
has to be different.</i>

588
01:43:00,079 --> 01:43:04,573
<i>Distribution should be in favour
of our whole society...</i>

589
01:43:04,717 --> 01:43:06,912
<i>...and not in favour
of a few individuals.</i>

590
01:43:07,386 --> 01:43:10,947
<i>Only then can you preserve
the humanitarian principle.</i>

591
01:43:11,590 --> 01:43:13,251
<i>If we do not change the system...</i>

592
01:43:13,392 --> 01:43:18,489
...there will be
new selection mechanisms:

593
01:43:19,298 --> 01:43:22,461
...selection mechanisms
between states...

594
01:43:22,601 --> 01:43:24,296
...between races...

595
01:43:24,903 --> 01:43:26,461
...between religions...

596
01:43:26,705 --> 01:43:29,902
...between people entitled
to use resources...

597
01:43:30,042 --> 01:43:31,669
...and those not entitled...

598
01:43:31,810 --> 01:43:35,644
...between valuable people
and those who are not valuable.

599
01:43:36,115 --> 01:43:40,711
In this case, the monetary value
of a human being will prevail...

600
01:43:42,287 --> 01:43:46,815
...and a new barbarian era will begin.

601
01:43:46,959 --> 01:43:48,324
This is ineluctable.

602
01:43:57,603 --> 01:43:58,661
<i>In the end...</i>

603
01:43:59,538 --> 01:44:05,238
<i>...the average citizen will pay for it.</i>

604
01:44:06,412 --> 01:44:08,812
The so-called " little man".

605
01:44:08,947 --> 01:44:11,507
Or the "little women" - People...

606
01:44:11,650 --> 01:44:17,418
...who have no influence whatsoever
on the process...

607
01:44:18,357 --> 01:44:23,124
<i>...unless they get organized...</i>

608
01:44:24,363 --> 01:44:27,958
...unless they find someone
to represent their interests...

609
01:44:28,100 --> 01:44:32,161
...strong enough to stop this process.

610
01:44:40,546 --> 01:44:43,014
<i>We are now at the Reichstag...</i>

611
01:44:43,148 --> 01:44:45,241
<i>...the seat of the German Parliament.</i>

612
01:44:45,384 --> 01:44:47,375
<i>Here we see traces of World War I...</i>

613
01:44:47,519 --> 01:44:52,047
<i>...which ended
with the capture of the Reichstag...</i>

614
01:44:52,191 --> 01:44:54,489
<i>...by Russian soldiers...</i>

615
01:44:54,626 --> 01:44:57,493
<i>...who wrote their greetings
to their homeland.</i>

616
01:44:57,629 --> 01:45:00,723
<i>This should remind us of the fact...</i>

617
01:45:00,866 --> 01:45:05,803
<i>...that without a new form
of distribution of wealth...</i>

618
01:45:06,972 --> 01:45:10,999
<i>...without a solution for the question
of the environment...</i>

619
01:45:11,877 --> 01:45:17,372
<i>...by using renewable instead
of non-renewable resources...</i>

620
01:45:17,516 --> 01:45:19,245
