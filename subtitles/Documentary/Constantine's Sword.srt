1
00:00:17,016 --> 00:00:18,516
Dave! Callie! Hey!

2
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,085
What's going on in there?! You guys okay?

3
00:00:23,589 --> 00:00:25,056
Dave, Callie, what's happening?!

4
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:26,224
Quit messing around!

5
00:00:26,258 --> 00:00:28,226
Come on, guys, what's going on...?

6
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:27,285
Please... No more.

00:02:05,991 --> 00:02:06,958
Just breathe deeply, baby.

9
00:02:06,991 --> 00:02:08,358
Your grandma's gonna be here real soon.

10
00:02:08,392 --> 00:02:10,193
- She's gonna take you to...
- Hey, Sullivan.

11
00:02:10,227 --> 00:02:11,194
Sergeant wants you back at your post.

12
00:02:11,228 --> 00:02:13,396
Emily and I are having a visit.

13
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,798
You don't want to make the sergeant wait.

14
00:02:14,832 --> 00:02:16,733
I'll take that chance.

15
00:02:16,767 --> 00:02:19,302
Easy, Sullivan, I'm just trying
to save you a reprimand.

16
00:02:20,838 --> 00:02:23,239
Excuse me, baby.

17
00:02:25,342 --> 00:02:27,277
That girl just lost her parents.

18
00:02:27,311 --> 00:02:29,746
Yeah, and social services is on its way.

19
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,614
I'm done listening to you.

20
00:02:31,649 --> 00:02:32,248
I said... Enough!

21
00:02:34,752 --> 00:02:36,486
Shots fired! What was that?

22
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,456
It's okay, he didn't do anything.

23
00:02:42,626 --> 00:02:44,727
It's okay. I'm sorry.

24
00:02:44,762 --> 00:02:46,429
It's okay. Come on, let's go.

25
00:02:48,966 --> 00:02:50,900
Hey, hey. Get up, get up.

26
00:02:50,935 --> 00:02:52,235
You got to get up right now.

27
00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:53,970
Get up! Wake up.

28
00:02:54,004 --> 00:02:55,572
- You got to go right now.
- Good morning, sunshine.

29
00:02:55,606 --> 00:02:56,806
Oh, wait a minute, w... What is it?

30
00:02:56,841 --> 00:02:58,408
It's, uh... It's Nora.

31
00:02:58,442 --> 00:02:59,776
Right.

32
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,311
Uh, yeah, it's time to go. Here's your tie.

33
00:03:01,345 --> 00:03:03,246
- Get up.
- Or we could just stay in.

34
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,482
I cook a wicked breakfast.

35
00:03:05,516 --> 00:03:07,250
Bacon, eggs, sausage, beans, tomatoes.

36
00:03:07,284 --> 00:03:09,319
Perfect islands in a sea of grease.

37
00:03:09,353 --> 00:03:10,620
No, um, my boyfriend just called,

38
00:03:10,654 --> 00:03:11,921
he's gonna be here any minute...

39
00:03:11,956 --> 00:03:13,957
You didn't tell me last night
you had a boyfriend.

40
00:03:13,991 --> 00:03:15,692
Yeah, I did, get up,
come on, get your stuff.

41
00:03:15,726 --> 00:03:17,427
I'll set the table for three, then.

42
00:03:17,461 --> 00:03:18,495
Hey, Nora, you up?

43
00:03:18,529 --> 00:03:19,929
Oh, he said "Nora," I was right.

44
00:03:19,964 --> 00:03:21,564
- Get your ass out of bed!
- Yeah. Go.

45
00:03:28,806 --> 00:03:29,873
Oh, hi, honey.

46
00:03:30,207 --> 00:03:31,707
I was just in the bathroom.

47
00:03:33,807 --> 00:03:35,722
Okay, Zed's in our class.

48
00:03:35,756 --> 00:03:37,057
You're my problem today.

49
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,658
So, where do you want to start?

50
00:03:38,693 --> 00:03:40,060
Back in bed.

51
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:42,195
Just being honest.

52
00:03:45,794 --> 00:03:47,228
Chas, I know what I need to do,

53
00:03:47,262 --> 00:03:48,629
and I'll get it sorted, all right?

54
00:03:48,664 --> 00:03:50,031
As soon as you go home.

55
00:03:54,303 --> 00:03:55,302
I'm not going anywhere.

56
00:03:58,607 --> 00:04:00,341
Fine.

57
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,610
Let's see.

58
00:04:05,781 --> 00:04:09,083
Birmingham... That's like
what, two hours away?

59
00:04:09,117 --> 00:04:11,752
Well...

60
00:04:11,787 --> 00:04:13,721
We'll be there by lunch.

61
00:04:27,202 --> 00:04:29,603
Looks like we're late to the party.

62
00:04:29,638 --> 00:04:32,273
Local police blotter reported
a double homicide last night.

63
00:04:32,307 --> 00:04:33,774
Man and his wife.

64
00:04:33,809 --> 00:04:35,776
Battered beyond recognition.

65
00:04:35,811 --> 00:04:37,178
Bite marks?

66
00:04:37,212 --> 00:04:38,379
Puncture wounds?

67
00:04:38,413 --> 00:04:39,814
Flesh torn asunder?

68
00:04:39,848 --> 00:04:41,615
No details in the report.

69
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,017
They had a young daughter.

70
00:04:43,051 --> 00:04:44,619
Untouched in the attack.

71
00:04:44,653 --> 00:04:47,188
We'll start by figuring out
why she was spared.

72
00:04:47,222 --> 00:04:49,223
I'm breaking in, you stand watch.

73
00:04:49,257 --> 00:04:50,324
If I need you...

74
00:04:50,359 --> 00:04:51,826
I shall give you a little whistle

75
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,161
that suddenly chokes into silence.

76
00:05:26,962 --> 00:05:27,762
Oh, sh...!

77
00:05:31,162 --> 00:05:32,395
You know, I've never punched an angel,

78
00:05:32,429 --> 00:05:33,730
but you are begging for it, mate.

79
00:05:33,764 --> 00:05:35,498
I could announce my arrival with trumpets.

80
00:05:35,533 --> 00:05:38,368
Used to have a tight horn
section back in the day.

81
00:05:38,402 --> 00:05:39,903
Mm, I'm sure you did.

82
00:05:39,937 --> 00:05:44,007
Smells of burning,
but there's no sign of fire.

83
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:47,811
Some serious telekinetic energy
was spent here last night.

84
00:05:47,845 --> 00:05:49,212
What is it you want?

85
00:05:49,246 --> 00:05:50,413
Battle plans, John.

86
00:05:50,447 --> 00:05:51,414
Time to draw them up.

87
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:53,416
Battle plans, eh?

88
00:05:53,451 --> 00:05:55,718
You know bugger-all
about what we're up against.

89
00:05:55,753 --> 00:05:58,154
I know there's a darkness rising, John.

90
00:05:58,189 --> 00:06:00,757
It's ancient beyond measure.

91
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:03,093
You're going to stem the tide
of its attacks.

92
00:06:05,696 --> 00:06:08,698
And, uh, what makes me so special?

93
00:06:08,732 --> 00:06:10,533
Nothing that I'm aware of.

94
00:06:10,568 --> 00:06:12,502
St. Peter.

95
00:06:12,536 --> 00:06:13,903
Ignatius of antioch. Joan of Arc.

96
00:06:13,938 --> 00:06:15,538
Oh, John, they were special.

97
00:06:15,573 --> 00:06:16,906
Mmm. You're more of a...

98
00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:19,542
Desperation move.

99
00:06:19,577 --> 00:06:21,611
Story of my life, mate.

100
00:06:21,645 --> 00:06:23,546
Well, as long as you're here,

101
00:06:23,581 --> 00:06:25,281
might as well make yourself useful.

102
00:06:25,316 --> 00:06:28,551
Why was that girl spared from the attack?

103
00:06:30,145 --> 00:06:31,712
I can't tell you that.

104
00:06:33,445 --> 00:06:34,511
Well, you're a divine messenger

105
00:06:34,546 --> 00:06:36,714
with an omnipotent boss.

106
00:06:36,745 --> 00:06:37,911
Don't be stingy.

107
00:06:37,946 --> 00:06:40,647
When humanity was granted free will,

108
00:06:40,682 --> 00:06:42,015
angels lost the power

109
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,984
to directly influence events on earth.

110
00:06:44,018 --> 00:06:45,819
That's just the kind of double-talk

111
00:06:45,854 --> 00:06:47,654
I expect from your type.

112
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:50,390
The broken coffee mug
pieces are on the floor,

113
00:06:50,425 --> 00:06:53,560
but the coffee stains are on the counter.

114
00:06:53,595 --> 00:06:54,995
Doesn't add up. Would
it make you feel better

115
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:57,197
if I told you you were getting warm?

116
00:06:57,232 --> 00:07:00,667
I need to see what happened here.

117
00:07:00,702 --> 00:07:02,536
The rules have changed, John.

118
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,172
The things you're used
to dealing with have more power.

119
00:07:05,206 --> 00:07:06,340
They move faster. Hunger deeper.

120
00:07:06,374 --> 00:07:08,275
Your old ways might not work.

121
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:09,843
Be open.

122
00:07:09,878 --> 00:07:11,779
Step aside, sunshine.

123
00:07:13,748 --> 00:07:16,116
Ximbatik kaajal

124
00:07:16,151 --> 00:07:20,187
ak bin-ka-aak-abtal.

125
00:07:20,221 --> 00:07:21,855
Mayan.

126
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,490
Impressive.

127
00:07:43,978 --> 00:07:47,648
She was possessed by the spirit of a child.

128
00:07:47,682 --> 00:07:48,916
The daughter survived the attacks

129
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,451
because she was the attacker.

130
00:07:50,485 --> 00:07:52,719
That entity inside her,
it was controlling her.

131
00:07:52,754 --> 00:07:54,655
Now that it's loose,

132
00:07:54,689 --> 00:07:57,591
it'll be looking
for a new child to possess.

133
00:08:08,036 --> 00:08:09,336
What's going on?

134
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,938
There's someone in my room.

135
00:08:10,972 --> 00:08:13,674
Again?

136
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:14,975
Come here, sweetie.

137
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:17,277
You're just fine.

138
00:08:17,312 --> 00:08:19,213
There's no one here.

139
00:08:21,983 --> 00:08:23,617
Or here.

140
00:08:23,652 --> 00:08:25,119
Oh...

141
00:08:25,153 --> 00:08:26,186
I know.

142
00:08:27,355 --> 00:08:28,722
He's in the closet, right?

143
00:08:34,896 --> 00:08:36,330
It's just a closet, Henry.

144
00:08:36,364 --> 00:08:37,598
Hey.

145
00:08:37,632 --> 00:08:39,266
This happens at Halloween.

146
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,868
Your imagination runs wild.

147
00:08:40,902 --> 00:08:42,803
Remember last year you didn't
want to trick-or-treat

148
00:08:42,837 --> 00:08:44,271
'cause you were afraid of the monsters?

149
00:08:44,305 --> 00:08:45,706
Yeah.

150
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,941
Don't worry. I handled that.

151
00:08:47,976 --> 00:08:50,277
Darrell.

152
00:08:50,311 --> 00:08:52,846
There's a whole costume
that comes with this.

153
00:08:52,881 --> 00:08:55,682
You wear that and the kids will
be scared of you... I promise.

154
00:08:55,717 --> 00:08:57,017
You honestly think this is helpful?

155
00:08:57,052 --> 00:08:58,318
Honestly?

156
00:08:58,353 --> 00:09:00,387
Henry's a strong kid if we just let him be.

157
00:09:02,657 --> 00:09:04,958
Hey...

158
00:09:04,993 --> 00:09:07,995
You are strong, you know that, buddy.

159
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:09,930
But you need to believe it.

160
00:09:16,571 --> 00:09:18,072
You're just fine, sweetie pie.

161
00:09:18,106 --> 00:09:19,573
Now try and go back to sleep, honey.

162
00:09:19,607 --> 00:09:22,676
Have sweet dreams.

163
00:10:54,135 --> 00:10:55,502
No...

164
00:11:09,739 --> 00:11:11,006
Is everything all right?

165
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,241
I'm sorry.

166
00:11:12,275 --> 00:11:13,509
I don't know why I screamed.

167
00:11:13,543 --> 00:11:14,810
You can go back to bed now.

168
00:11:16,412 --> 00:11:17,746
Really?

169
00:11:20,717 --> 00:11:23,352
I'm feeling much better.

170
00:11:23,386 --> 00:11:25,387
You'll see.

171
00:11:35,298 --> 00:11:38,500
You know, I could lose my paralegal
license meeting you here like this,

172
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,704
but I owe you, honey.

173
00:11:41,738 --> 00:11:43,872
I sweet-talked this

174
00:11:43,907 --> 00:11:45,941
from a guy in child services.

175
00:11:45,975 --> 00:11:48,377
Cute, but clingy.

176
00:11:48,411 --> 00:11:49,445
Here's your girl.

177
00:11:49,479 --> 00:11:51,246
Emily Cooper.

178
00:11:51,281 --> 00:11:52,714
Any chance I can get close to her?

179
00:11:52,749 --> 00:11:53,982
She's untouchable.

180
00:11:54,017 --> 00:11:55,451
Not only is she under

181
00:11:55,485 --> 00:11:56,718
psychological care,

182
00:11:56,753 --> 00:11:58,053
but she's in protective custody.

183
00:11:58,088 --> 00:11:59,555
Why?

184
00:11:59,589 --> 00:12:01,457
The coppers can't possibly have a suspect.

185
00:12:01,491 --> 00:12:03,592
No, but there's been
a series of killings like this

186
00:12:03,626 --> 00:12:04,827
across the southeast.

187
00:12:04,861 --> 00:12:07,429
Dead parents, beaten to a pulp?

188
00:12:07,464 --> 00:12:08,797
They all had one child.

189
00:12:08,832 --> 00:12:09,999
The children all survived the attacks.

190
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:11,800
Cases were never connected,

191
00:12:11,835 --> 00:12:13,769
because of the time between the killings.

192
00:12:13,803 --> 00:12:17,906
First one on record, 35 years ago.

193
00:12:17,941 --> 00:12:19,074
One after that,

194
00:12:19,109 --> 00:12:22,611
16 years later, then 18 years.

195
00:12:22,645 --> 00:12:24,346
Now three

196
00:12:24,381 --> 00:12:26,648
in the last month.

197
00:12:26,683 --> 00:12:29,151
That's when the cops smartened up.
These children,

198
00:12:29,185 --> 00:12:31,086
have they got anything in common?

199
00:12:31,121 --> 00:12:33,155
What, you mean, like horns
growing out of their heads?

200
00:12:34,124 --> 00:12:36,792
No, but they did start

201
00:12:36,826 --> 00:12:39,595
throwing fits days before the killings.

202
00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:41,497
Just angry outbursts at home, at school.

203
00:12:41,531 --> 00:12:43,499
I suspect that's because they had

204
00:12:43,533 --> 00:12:45,701
a malevolent spirit inside them.

205
00:12:45,735 --> 00:12:47,836
You mean like my Roger?

206
00:12:47,871 --> 00:12:50,806
No, luv.

207
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,341
Your dearly departed husband wasn't

208
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:53,876
inhabiting bodies, he was just

209
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,811
pissing and moaning about being dead.

210
00:12:55,845 --> 00:12:59,681
Well, it is a lot quieter around my house

211
00:12:59,716 --> 00:13:01,884
since you helped him cross over.

212
00:13:01,918 --> 00:13:04,353
I need to find out who this
spirit was when it was alive.

213
00:13:04,387 --> 00:13:06,555
Sometimes they can forget who they are,

214
00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:08,524
and just naming them
releases them from our world.

215
00:13:08,558 --> 00:13:10,192
I wonder if any of these survivors

216
00:13:10,226 --> 00:13:12,194
remembers the name of the soul
that possessed them.

217
00:13:12,228 --> 00:13:14,863
Well, you won't get near the
kids from the recent cases, but

218
00:13:14,898 --> 00:13:17,499
one of the early survivors lives nearby.

219
00:13:17,534 --> 00:13:20,569
Marcello Panneti.

220
00:13:20,603 --> 00:13:22,638
He'd be in his 40s now, I suppose.

221
00:13:22,672 --> 00:13:23,906
Where can I find him?

222
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,874
Local mental hospital.

223
00:13:26,943 --> 00:13:28,510
Perfect.

224
00:13:28,545 --> 00:13:31,347
I'll feel right at home.

225
00:13:36,052 --> 00:13:39,888
Marcello introduced his
daddy's head to an axe.

226
00:13:39,923 --> 00:13:41,690
Mommy's head went into the thresher.

227
00:13:41,725 --> 00:13:44,860
At least they think it was her head.

228
00:13:44,894 --> 00:13:47,096
So I'm not surprised
nobody comes to visit him.

229
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,597
Especially not his...

230
00:13:48,631 --> 00:13:50,532
Family.

231
00:13:50,567 --> 00:13:54,503
Ten years old, dismantled
two fully grown adults.

232
00:13:54,537 --> 00:13:55,838
Bit unlikely, don't you think?

233
00:13:55,872 --> 00:13:57,606
Oh, no. Kids are sponges.

234
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,041
They soak up whatever you give 'em.

235
00:13:59,075 --> 00:14:01,210
And Marcello, well,

236
00:14:01,244 --> 00:14:03,679
his handiwork with an axe
is something of a...

237
00:14:03,713 --> 00:14:06,448
Family tradition. Rumor is there's a bloody

238
00:14:06,483 --> 00:14:08,751
tree stump outside the
farmhouse where he grew up.

239
00:14:08,785 --> 00:14:10,586
Whenever Marcello misbehaved,

240
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,454
his punishment was...

241
00:14:12,489 --> 00:14:13,989
Severe.

242
00:14:25,168 --> 00:14:26,769
Ah.

243
00:14:26,803 --> 00:14:29,772
It's beautiful this time a year, innit?

244
00:14:33,309 --> 00:14:35,310
Not one for a wee natter.

245
00:14:37,981 --> 00:14:40,282
Then you're my kind of bloke.

246
00:14:40,316 --> 00:14:42,418
But I'm trying to prevent
someone from going through

247
00:14:42,452 --> 00:14:44,753
the same experience that you did as a kid.

248
00:14:54,531 --> 00:14:56,699
Bloody hell.

249
00:15:15,785 --> 00:15:17,786
Hello?

250
00:15:24,327 --> 00:15:26,328
Henry?

251
00:15:58,928 --> 00:16:00,929
Who's there?

252
00:17:01,391 --> 00:17:03,892
Aah, aah! Oh.

253
00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:07,363
Did you do this, Henry?

254
00:17:07,397 --> 00:17:08,864
No.

255
00:17:08,898 --> 00:17:10,065
I just walked in.

256
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,067
I heard noises out here.

257
00:17:12,102 --> 00:17:13,969
Yeah, same here.

258
00:17:14,004 --> 00:17:15,471
I think somebody was in the house.

259
00:17:19,476 --> 00:17:20,576
Gonna go back to my room now.

260
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:22,211
Hey, dad?

261
00:17:22,245 --> 00:17:23,812
What?

262
00:17:23,847 --> 00:17:25,414
Be careful.

263
00:17:37,497 --> 00:17:39,164
Marcello was useless, the poor bastard.

264
00:17:39,199 --> 00:17:41,100
Fully catatonic.

265
00:17:41,134 --> 00:17:43,202
You know, most people
who survive a possession...

266
00:17:43,236 --> 00:17:45,237
They're downright chatty about the ordeal.

267
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,172
Tough break for him.

268
00:17:47,207 --> 00:17:49,108
Not entirely.

269
00:17:49,142 --> 00:17:50,843
His parents got what they deserved.

270
00:17:50,877 --> 00:17:53,178
But we have to stop this evil entity, mate.

271
00:17:53,213 --> 00:17:55,014
It's a bloody serial killer

272
00:17:55,048 --> 00:17:56,382
through the ages. Well, if it's

273
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:57,716
been around for that long, maybe we can

274
00:17:57,751 --> 00:17:59,685
track down another living survivor.

275
00:17:59,719 --> 00:18:01,754
No time to mess with that.

276
00:18:01,788 --> 00:18:03,889
With the rising darkness,

277
00:18:03,924 --> 00:18:07,560
we got to stop this thing before
it has a mind to kill again.

278
00:18:09,896 --> 00:18:10,896
Take a look at this.

279
00:18:10,931 --> 00:18:12,631
What kind of map is that?

280
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:13,766
These are ley lines.

281
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,100
Mystical trackways

282
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,969
flowing with electromagnetic energy.

283
00:18:18,772 --> 00:18:22,074
These x's mark the home
address of every victim

284
00:18:22,108 --> 00:18:23,642
whose parents were slaughtered.

285
00:18:24,477 --> 00:18:26,645
They all fall

286
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,614
- on the same line.
- Yeah.

287
00:18:28,648 --> 00:18:31,116
Ley lines are a psychic railroad,

288
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,285
easy for a child's soul to travel.

289
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,554
To find the next victim, we just...

290
00:18:35,589 --> 00:18:36,755
Follow the line.

291
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,557
Follow...

292
00:18:38,592 --> 00:18:40,993
The line.

293
00:19:22,402 --> 00:19:24,770
We know which ley lines
the spirits are following.

294
00:19:24,804 --> 00:19:27,773
Now we just need something
to detect the malignant thing.

295
00:19:29,342 --> 00:19:31,010
What's this do?

296
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,778
Oh, put that down, that can't help us.

297
00:19:32,812 --> 00:19:35,881
That's not what I asked.
I asked you what it does.

298
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:39,618
But you're too self-involved
to hear me, like always.

299
00:19:39,653 --> 00:19:42,554
Like Renee. She's gone.

300
00:19:42,589 --> 00:19:44,990
I'm afraid I wasn't enough
to keep her from leaving.

301
00:19:45,025 --> 00:19:47,293
Can't bring myself
to tell you about it, though.

302
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,627
Not that you'd hear me...

303
00:19:48,662 --> 00:19:50,196
This is the sword of night.

304
00:19:51,531 --> 00:19:54,333
It compels the holder to speak the truth.

305
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:56,802
Oh.

306
00:19:56,837 --> 00:19:59,405
Is there anything you...

307
00:19:59,439 --> 00:20:01,407
Want to talk about, or...

308
00:20:01,441 --> 00:20:04,376
- No, no.
- Well, you got to hand it to Jasper.

309
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,378
This old mill's a treasure trove, eh?

310
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:07,947
Yes!

311
00:20:08,949 --> 00:20:10,549
There she is.

312
00:20:12,219 --> 00:20:14,753
What is it?

313
00:20:14,788 --> 00:20:17,756
Oh, there's no time
for explanations. You'll see.

314
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:21,527
Right... Now all I need
is some frankincense.

315
00:20:32,906 --> 00:20:34,907
Let these cool.

316
00:20:34,941 --> 00:20:36,375
They'll make a good snack while we work.

317
00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:38,410
What are they?

318
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:41,747
Your favorite... Pumpkin seeds.

319
00:20:43,383 --> 00:20:44,617
Oh, markers.

320
00:20:44,651 --> 00:20:46,485
I'll be right back.

321
00:20:55,562 --> 00:20:57,830
Got 'em.

322
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:07,439
Henry, what did you do?

323
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,608
Carved the pumpkins.

324
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,744
You know you're not allowed

325
00:21:11,778 --> 00:21:13,112
to pick up knives.

326
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,814
- Give me that.
- I'm not done carving.

327
00:21:15,849 --> 00:21:19,351
Henry, hand me the knife.

328
00:21:26,459 --> 00:21:27,927
Now.

329
00:21:32,365 --> 00:21:33,933
I'll put this inside.

330
00:21:52,285 --> 00:21:54,653
How long do we got to do this for?

331
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,956
We walk until the frankincense directs us.

332
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:59,792
According to Jasper's maps, the
ley line continues on this road

333
00:21:59,826 --> 00:22:02,094
for a quarter mile and then we veer right.

334
00:22:02,128 --> 00:22:03,662
Whoa, stop.

335
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:06,699
Look.

336
00:22:06,733 --> 00:22:09,435
Wrong way, mate.

337
00:22:09,469 --> 00:22:12,304
Frankincense flees the
presence of malevolent energy.

338
00:22:12,339 --> 00:22:15,207
What we want... is behind you.

339
00:22:18,345 --> 00:22:21,180
So, now what? We knock on the door?

340
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:23,215
No, that never works.

341
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,651
Why not?

342
00:22:25,685 --> 00:22:28,020
Oh, hello, we tracked an
evil spirit to your house.

343
00:22:28,054 --> 00:22:29,455
It might be inside your kid.

344
00:22:29,489 --> 00:22:31,056
Do you mind if take a look?

345
00:22:31,091 --> 00:22:32,558
Yeah, that won't work. No.

346
00:22:32,592 --> 00:22:34,994
Our best bet is
to hunker down for the night.

347
00:22:35,028 --> 00:22:37,429
We wait, watch and listen for an attack.

348
00:23:05,023 --> 00:23:06,824
I didn't do nothing.

349
00:23:06,858 --> 00:23:09,527
Hey, hey, teach?

350
00:23:11,129 --> 00:23:14,699
You got a couple of kids
getting shirty over there.

351
00:23:14,733 --> 00:23:17,035
- What's in that trench coat?
- I am.

352
00:23:17,133 --> 00:23:19,368
Now, go and stop that row, will
you, before someone gets hurt.

353
00:23:21,137 --> 00:23:24,039
- You got a kid at this school?
- No I don't got a kid at this school.

354
00:23:24,074 --> 00:23:26,342
Will you just turn around?

355
00:23:26,376 --> 00:23:29,945
You're just a little baby. Want your mommy?

356
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,547
You're just a little punk. Get up.

357
00:23:46,396 --> 00:23:48,831
Bollocks!

358
00:23:51,434 --> 00:23:53,802
That boy

359
00:23:53,837 --> 00:23:55,204
came into my hospital with

360
00:23:55,238 --> 00:23:58,340
a fractured skull. What did you do to him?

361
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:00,476
Were you defending yourself, buddy?

362
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,477
Don't "buddy" him.

363
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,010
There is never any reason

364
00:24:03,044 --> 00:24:05,479
for anything like this to happen, ever.

365
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:20,644
Hello. My name's John Constantine.

366
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:23,180
I'm the new counselor at the school.

367
00:24:23,215 --> 00:24:25,383
I've come to check on your son.

368
00:24:25,417 --> 00:24:27,351
We really do hate sending
him home like this.

369
00:24:27,386 --> 00:24:29,787
Come on in. I'm Darrell.

370
00:24:29,821 --> 00:24:31,288
This is my wife, Clair.

371
00:24:31,323 --> 00:24:33,157
We were just trying to figure out

372
00:24:33,191 --> 00:24:35,126
why he acted out today.

373
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,193
It's just not him.

374
00:24:36,228 --> 00:24:38,562
You are right about that, ma'am.

375
00:24:41,667 --> 00:24:43,401
What are you doing?

376
00:24:43,435 --> 00:24:45,369
What the hell is that?

377
00:24:45,404 --> 00:24:47,505
It's a mandrake root. Malevolent
spirits can't stand 'em.

378
00:24:47,539 --> 00:24:50,841
I had to show you what you're up against.

379
00:24:50,876 --> 00:24:52,877
I'm an exorcist. Your son's possessed.

380
00:24:52,911 --> 00:24:55,680
- We don't have much time.
- Get out!

381
00:24:55,714 --> 00:24:58,482
I told Chas this wouldn't work.
Look, you said so yourself...

382
00:24:58,517 --> 00:25:00,818
That's not your Henry... And you're right.

383
00:25:00,852 --> 00:25:02,086
It's an indwelling spirit,

384
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,321
been murdering for decades.

385
00:25:03,355 --> 00:25:05,589
- And you're next in line.
- Get out!

386
00:25:05,624 --> 00:25:08,359
Look, you know your son best.

387
00:25:08,393 --> 00:25:12,196
Just keep and eye on him, and, uh, call me

388
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:14,332
if something happens.

389
00:25:14,366 --> 00:25:16,400
You know what? I've got a better plan.

390
00:25:24,076 --> 00:25:25,776
You didn't manage

391
00:25:25,811 --> 00:25:29,380
to sneak a bottle past
our friends out there, did you?

392
00:25:34,052 --> 00:25:36,354
I should be ashamed of myself.

393
00:25:36,388 --> 00:25:38,222
Time was, you'd be asking me for a favor

394
00:25:38,256 --> 00:25:39,757
and now look at me.

395
00:25:39,791 --> 00:25:42,193
No bail money, no booze...

396
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:45,326
It only took me, like,
six months in the loony bin

397
00:25:45,361 --> 00:25:47,662
to turn me into a bloody amateur.

398
00:25:53,502 --> 00:25:56,104
I'm cursed when it comes to kids.

399
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:58,006
Hmm.

400
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,640
Probably on the account

401
00:25:59,675 --> 00:26:03,645
that I was such a wretched
little bastard myself.

402
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:04,946
Wow.

403
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:09,217
You really should get therapy for that.

404
00:26:10,552 --> 00:26:11,853
Piss off.

405
00:26:11,887 --> 00:26:13,121
You made it perfectly clear

406
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,622
you're not allowed to help me.

407
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:16,291
I said the exact opposite.

408
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:18,760
What, did shock therapy
destroy your hearing?

409
00:26:18,794 --> 00:26:20,762
All right, then.

410
00:26:20,796 --> 00:26:23,765
Go and warn mummy and daddy

411
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:25,366
about their little demon seed,

412
00:26:25,401 --> 00:26:26,834
send it back to hell,

413
00:26:26,869 --> 00:26:29,103
oh, and pick us up a gin and tonic, eh?

414
00:26:29,138 --> 00:26:30,438
Guidance, John.

415
00:26:30,472 --> 00:26:32,273
I can offer you guidance.

416
00:26:32,308 --> 00:26:33,942
Oh, thank you very much.

417
00:26:33,976 --> 00:26:35,777
I've made it through my life
without any help

418
00:26:35,811 --> 00:26:36,978
from you.

419
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:39,314
You sure about that?

420
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:41,182
How do you know I wasn't by your side

421
00:26:41,216 --> 00:26:42,984
when your father burned
you with his cigarette?

422
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,320
Or stayed you from suicide

423
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,722
when your sister left you alone with him?

424
00:26:49,591 --> 00:26:51,059
That's enough of that, you.

425
00:26:52,428 --> 00:26:54,762
You didn't have it easy, John.

426
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,800
If you want to save a child,

427
00:26:58,834 --> 00:27:01,402
just remember what it was like to be one.

428
00:27:01,437 --> 00:27:06,407
Well, aren't you a regular
little clever clocks?

429
00:27:06,442 --> 00:27:09,410
You know what I think
of that dog's breakfast?

430
00:27:09,445 --> 00:27:11,913
Oh, bloody hell. I hate
it when he does that.

431
00:27:13,248 --> 00:27:14,482
Oh.

432
00:27:14,516 --> 00:27:15,850
Nice.

433
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,485
Lovely.

434
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:18,653
Your temper could've
gotten us killed, Darrell.

435
00:27:18,687 --> 00:27:20,188
You are lucky he didn't have a gun.

436
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:22,490
Wouldn't have mattered. I knocked him flat.

437
00:27:22,524 --> 00:27:24,592
We have a son now; He's watching you.
Stop fighting.

438
00:27:24,627 --> 00:27:25,860
I'm glad that he's watching!

439
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,262
Because he needs a male role model.

440
00:27:27,296 --> 00:27:29,063
Be a mom, fine, coddle him.

441
00:27:29,098 --> 00:27:31,065
But he's gotta learn
how to handle himself in life.

442
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,568
Oh, like he handled himself
on the playground?

443
00:27:33,602 --> 00:27:36,571
- It's an elementary school...
- Stop fighting!

444
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:49,584
Henry?

445
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:54,289
What happened

446
00:27:54,323 --> 00:27:56,024
in here?

447
00:27:56,058 --> 00:27:58,960
What's that burning smell?

448
00:27:58,994 --> 00:28:01,262
You gonna hurt me?

449
00:28:03,832 --> 00:28:06,034
No. No, of course not.

450
00:28:06,068 --> 00:28:07,568
Henry...

451
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:09,938
Violence?

452
00:28:09,972 --> 00:28:11,973
This isn't the way to
express your emotions.

453
00:28:12,007 --> 00:28:13,608
How did you even do this?

454
00:28:13,642 --> 00:28:15,643
You have to clean this mess up...

455
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:19,580
Rise and shine.

456
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:20,882
You got a visitor.

457
00:28:20,916 --> 00:28:22,283
Johnny, I told you not to bother me

458
00:28:22,318 --> 00:28:23,851
unless you bring me breakfast.

459
00:28:38,367 --> 00:28:41,002
What did you mean when
you said my son's possessed?

460
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:48,943
Every one of these parents
had a little nipper

461
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:51,613
that was exhibiting the exact
same behavior as Henry.

462
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:53,915
What you said was true.

463
00:28:53,949 --> 00:28:55,516
Henry...

464
00:28:57,286 --> 00:28:59,954
Something's not right.

465
00:29:02,191 --> 00:29:05,326
Not all souls go gently into the night.

466
00:29:05,361 --> 00:29:07,195
A violent death can leave behind

467
00:29:07,229 --> 00:29:09,764
a bewildered or traumatized soul.

468
00:29:09,798 --> 00:29:11,699
Child spirits are the worst.

469
00:29:11,734 --> 00:29:14,769
They act out, like all brats...

470
00:29:14,803 --> 00:29:17,138
Only their tantrums end in blood.

471
00:29:19,909 --> 00:29:21,976
Okay.

472
00:29:22,011 --> 00:29:23,378
I need to do something.

473
00:29:23,412 --> 00:29:24,979
What can we do?

474
00:29:25,014 --> 00:29:26,881
If we knew who the spirit was
when it was alive,

475
00:29:26,916 --> 00:29:28,783
we could find a way
to release it peacefully,

476
00:29:28,817 --> 00:29:30,018
but this little bugger

477
00:29:30,052 --> 00:29:31,719
could be hundreds of years old.

478
00:29:31,754 --> 00:29:33,187
I could try and cast it out...

479
00:29:34,924 --> 00:29:37,959
But forceful exorcisms
with young children...

480
00:29:39,862 --> 00:29:40,929
What?

481
00:29:42,565 --> 00:29:44,132
Kids present challenges.

482
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:46,200
Even if we dispelled the spirit from Henry,

483
00:29:46,235 --> 00:29:47,735
it would just find another host.

484
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:49,037
Is there another option?

485
00:29:49,071 --> 00:29:50,638
I could bind it to one spot,

486
00:29:50,673 --> 00:29:52,073
but that presents a danger for us.

487
00:29:52,107 --> 00:29:54,008
And you'd have to be part of the team.

488
00:29:54,043 --> 00:29:56,411
I have a friend who can help us out, but...

489
00:29:56,445 --> 00:29:59,013
Well, you need at least three
people to hold a séance.

490
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:01,082
I will do whatever it takes

491
00:30:01,116 --> 00:30:02,550
to get my son back.

492
00:30:04,753 --> 00:30:06,554
You did say you were a doctor, right?

493
00:30:17,433 --> 00:30:18,700
Henry.

494
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:30,411
You've been looking a little
under the weather lately,

495
00:30:30,446 --> 00:30:32,380
so I brought some vitamins home from work.

496
00:30:34,783 --> 00:30:36,551
- What is it?
- Just some vitamins.

497
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:38,219
B-12.

498
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,888
I give them to you all the time.

499
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:41,289
You do?

500
00:30:41,323 --> 00:30:43,024
Yeah. Here.

501
00:30:43,058 --> 00:30:44,292
Just give me your arm.

502
00:30:47,896 --> 00:30:48,863
Stop...

503
00:30:48,898 --> 00:30:50,765
Stop!

504
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:51,466
Stop!

505
00:31:10,143 --> 00:31:12,511
Henry's asleep on the couch.
I'll be back soon.

506
00:31:12,546 --> 00:31:13,546
Yeah. See you, hon.

507
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:32,364
This was a longer drive than I expected.

508
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,067
We only have a couple more hours
before that sedative wears off.

509
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:36,402
Well, let's get to work then.

510
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:37,803
Clair, meet Chas.

511
00:31:37,837 --> 00:31:40,072
Hello. Thanks for helping my son.

512
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:42,408
Chas, take a look around back.
Make sure we're alone.

513
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,709
This one could get messy.

514
00:31:43,743 --> 00:31:46,212
- What is this place?
- This is the home

515
00:31:46,246 --> 00:31:48,814
of the first possession victim
we could find on record.

516
00:31:48,849 --> 00:31:52,618
A young boy killed his mother
and father here 35 years ago.

517
00:31:52,652 --> 00:31:55,488
The property never sold again.

518
00:31:58,692 --> 00:31:59,792
Who was he?

519
00:31:59,826 --> 00:32:01,327
Marcello Panneti.

520
00:32:01,361 --> 00:32:02,428
Nice bloke.

521
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:04,230
Doesn't say much.

522
00:32:04,264 --> 00:32:07,666
Now, I can't release the soul
from our world without its name,

523
00:32:07,701 --> 00:32:10,002
but I can bind it to one place so it can't

524
00:32:10,036 --> 00:32:11,537
go on killing.

525
00:32:13,106 --> 00:32:15,074
You want to trap it in this house.

526
00:32:15,108 --> 00:32:16,909
That thing inside your son

527
00:32:16,943 --> 00:32:18,944
has a powerful connection to this land.

528
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:21,380
It's just the spot for a summoning.

529
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:39,698
It knows we're here.

530
00:32:39,733 --> 00:32:41,100
The spirit?

531
00:32:41,134 --> 00:32:42,668
The house.

532
00:32:42,702 --> 00:32:44,937
Anyplace where tragedy occurred festers

533
00:32:44,971 --> 00:32:46,839
with energy.

534
00:32:46,873 --> 00:32:48,474
You learn to sense it after a while.

535
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:53,479
You okay?

536
00:32:59,586 --> 00:33:00,820
All clear.

537
00:33:08,261 --> 00:33:11,897
The murders happened in this room.

538
00:33:11,932 --> 00:33:14,366
This is where we'll hold the séance.

539
00:33:16,336 --> 00:33:18,904
Shall we then?

540
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:21,874
Now, we must hold hands.

541
00:33:21,908 --> 00:33:23,842
And not break contact.

542
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:25,544
Not until I recite the binding spell.

543
00:33:25,579 --> 00:33:26,612
Is that clear?

544
00:33:27,914 --> 00:33:29,749
You'll do fine.

545
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:36,856
Oh, clever spirit of the dead,

546
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:40,493
invader of flesh, traveler through time,

547
00:33:40,527 --> 00:33:44,063
we present you offerings
from life into death

548
00:33:44,097 --> 00:33:46,766
and invite you into our circle.

549
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,767
Move among us.

550
00:33:53,807 --> 00:33:55,407
Oh, cursed spirit of the dead,

551
00:33:55,442 --> 00:33:58,778
spiller of blood, destroyer of families,

552
00:33:58,812 --> 00:34:01,714
we command you into our circle.

553
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,415
Move among us

554
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:05,117
now!

555
00:34:06,887 --> 00:34:08,054
Don't break the circle!

556
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:16,095
It's coming.

557
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:37,616
A three-legged deer? What does that mean?

558
00:34:37,651 --> 00:34:39,785
It means we're wasting our bloody time.

559
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:44,156
What went wrong?

560
00:34:44,191 --> 00:34:45,824
Maybe Marcello was never possessed.

561
00:34:45,859 --> 00:34:47,760
He killed his parents on his own.

562
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,328
The spirit would have no
connection to this location.

563
00:34:49,362 --> 00:34:51,497
No! This house is on the ley line,

564
00:34:51,531 --> 00:34:53,999
just like all the other places of attack.

565
00:34:54,034 --> 00:34:55,601
Oh, come on, John. What are you missing?

566
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:58,671
Henry is going to wake up
any second. I'm afraid

567
00:34:58,705 --> 00:35:00,973
he's gonna go after my husband.
We need to get this thing

568
00:35:01,007 --> 00:35:03,909
- out of him.
- You do not want an exorcism, Clair.

569
00:35:03,944 --> 00:35:04,910
Trust me.

570
00:35:04,945 --> 00:35:06,712
I do.

571
00:35:07,714 --> 00:35:08,981
Trust you.

572
00:35:10,951 --> 00:35:13,285
Maybe I don't trust myself.

573
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,954
John...

574
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:18,124
I need you to save my son.

575
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:42,548
Oh, hey, buddy.

576
00:35:42,582 --> 00:35:44,517
Costume looks great.

577
00:35:44,551 --> 00:35:45,618
What did I tell you, little man?

578
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:50,022
Darrell? Where have you been?

579
00:35:50,056 --> 00:35:52,291
- I've been calling.
- Listen. I need to explain.

580
00:35:52,325 --> 00:35:55,494
- What's he doing out of jail?
- Your wife dropped the charges.

581
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:58,631
I'm here to exorcise
an evil spirit from your boy.

582
00:35:58,665 --> 00:36:00,833
And you're blaming me
for filling his head with ideas?

583
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:02,701
I know how it sounds crazy,
but you need to listen to him.

584
00:36:02,736 --> 00:36:04,203
No, I'm not listening to you anymore!

585
00:36:04,237 --> 00:36:05,538
You're out of control!

586
00:36:08,108 --> 00:36:09,742
Stop fighting!

587
00:36:12,612 --> 00:36:14,547
- Darrell!
- Conflict.

588
00:36:14,581 --> 00:36:16,916
That's the trigger.

589
00:36:26,193 --> 00:36:28,260
Henry!

590
00:36:29,296 --> 00:36:30,296
Henry!

591
00:36:32,799 --> 00:36:33,933
Hold it, kid!

592
00:36:39,106 --> 00:36:40,840
Aah! I'll be okay!

593
00:36:40,874 --> 00:36:42,007
He went down the street!

594
00:36:42,042 --> 00:36:43,275
I'll be back for you!

595
00:36:49,382 --> 00:36:51,717
Hey! You can't go in there!

596
00:36:53,587 --> 00:36:55,187
Hey, kids!

597
00:36:55,222 --> 00:36:57,456
Any of you see a short zombie?

598
00:36:57,491 --> 00:36:58,858
Yeah, he's in there.

599
00:36:58,892 --> 00:37:00,559
Hey, man! You need a ticket!

600
00:37:00,594 --> 00:37:02,728
Sorry, mate, we're closed.

601
00:38:20,769 --> 00:38:22,403
I wouldn't try anything if I was you, mate.

602
00:38:22,438 --> 00:38:24,105
This mirror's gonna

603
00:38:24,139 --> 00:38:25,673
throw it back in your face.

604
00:38:25,707 --> 00:38:27,809
Be a good lad now.

605
00:38:27,843 --> 00:38:29,210
Come home with me, yeah?

606
00:38:51,467 --> 00:38:54,035
An axe.

607
00:38:54,069 --> 00:38:55,670
Of course.

608
00:38:57,169 --> 00:38:58,203
I know what you are, boy.

609
00:38:58,237 --> 00:39:01,006
Even if you've forgotten.

610
00:39:01,037 --> 00:39:03,405
Your name is Marcello.

611
00:39:05,375 --> 00:39:07,343
I know why you're doing this.

612
00:39:08,077 --> 00:39:10,078
Your parents weren't
good people, were they?

613
00:39:10,112 --> 00:39:11,813
Your dad...

614
00:39:11,847 --> 00:39:14,182
He chopped off your fingers
on a bloody tree stump!

615
00:39:19,188 --> 00:39:21,656
And what... You're gonna piss
and moan about it forever?

616
00:39:26,663 --> 00:39:29,698
You're not the only one who
had it rough growing up, boy.

617
00:39:29,733 --> 00:39:31,900
This world's dark and full of pain.

618
00:39:31,935 --> 00:39:33,302
For everyone!

619
00:39:35,872 --> 00:39:39,008
Only most people don't leave
a trail of dead bodies

620
00:39:39,042 --> 00:39:42,478
and shattered lives in retribution!

621
00:39:47,684 --> 00:39:50,386
Oh, what? You want me
to feel sorry for you?

622
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,421
What about that poor girl
whose parents you murdered,

623
00:39:52,455 --> 00:39:55,557
to seek your retribution, eh?

624
00:39:55,592 --> 00:39:58,494
You'll get no such pity from me, boy!

625
00:40:02,065 --> 00:40:04,833
Marcello Panneti!

626
00:40:04,868 --> 00:40:06,268
As the one who named you,

627
00:40:06,302 --> 00:40:10,272
I bind you to your rightful place!

628
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,593
Where am I?

629
00:40:33,797 --> 00:40:36,198
Come on...

630
00:40:36,232 --> 00:40:38,233
Let's get you home, Henry.

631
00:40:40,937 --> 00:40:42,404
I thought Henry was possessed

632
00:40:42,439 --> 00:40:44,273
by the soul of a dead person.

633
00:40:45,065 --> 00:40:47,800
But it was the soul of a living one.

634
00:40:47,835 --> 00:40:49,869
Marcello was the oldest survivor on record

635
00:40:49,903 --> 00:40:51,605
because he was the first killer.

636
00:40:51,703 --> 00:40:53,537
But the act was so traumatic

637
00:40:53,572 --> 00:40:56,040
that his soul fled his body
and went right on killing.

638
00:40:56,074 --> 00:40:59,944
A soul can't cross over
while its body is still alive.

639
00:40:59,978 --> 00:41:01,512
So I sent Marcello's

640
00:41:01,546 --> 00:41:03,214
to the only place I could...

641
00:41:04,983 --> 00:41:08,085
At least he's locked in
a high security facility,

642
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:10,855
where qualified doctors
can heal his inner child.

643
00:41:10,889 --> 00:41:13,057
Who knows?

644
00:41:13,091 --> 00:41:16,394
Maybe one day he'll even find peace.

645
00:41:17,428 --> 00:41:19,729
And what of my rotten inner child?

646
00:41:19,763 --> 00:41:23,266
If humanity's what can save us,

647
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:26,603
then overcoming the damage
and weakness in my nature,

648
00:41:26,637 --> 00:41:30,206
it may be the part of this
battle that I dread most.

649
00:41:31,838 --> 00:41:33,338
I don't have the answers.

650
00:41:34,238 --> 00:41:36,039
I only know that a darkness is rising.

651
00:41:36,877 --> 00:41:41,979
And unless I can stop it,
the world will change forever.
