Mom, I want to talk
to you about something.

27
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,570
Mom.

28
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
me, too, honey.

29
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,410
I don't want to
make you nervous,

30
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:26,680
but Morgana Ferzari is here.

31
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,680
She wants to see how
you do in the shoot.

32
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,650
Now, don't worry.
Just be professional, okay?

33
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,890
I was talking about college.

34
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:35,760
- Honey, we've been through this.
- Sofia.

35
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,560
Yeah, Madeline, wait over there
until Farriet is ready.

36
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,160
Right now we have exciting
things on the table...

37
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,330
A modeling contract most
girls can only dream of.

38
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,370
All our hard work
is gonna pay off.

39
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:50,340
Yeah, but I would still love to
apply, you know, have options.

40
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,870
Uh, lift it up.
Okay, turn to your right.

41
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,770
Stop. Okay.

42
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,910
This... will give you options.

43
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,810
- The latest proofs.
- Oh, excuse me.

44
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,820
Um, hey, you are
coming tomorrow, right?

45
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:08,450
Darling, we can't do everything.

46
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,390
Graduation's important.

47
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:12,790
I know, and so is a meeting
about your contract.

48
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,360
Yeah, she's ready.

49
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,790
I'm ready.
Let's go. I'm waiting.

50
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,670
Oh, this is futile!

51
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:22,870
None of this is gonna work.

52
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,240
Fashion Week is two weeks away.

53
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,480
Where are my others assistants?

54
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,310
Huh.

55
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:34,610
If you remove the wings,

56
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,850
you can let the simplicity of
the dress speak for itself.

57
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:41,490
And with this burnt rouge...

58
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,560
bring the eye from the hemline

59
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,390
through the bodice,
highlighting the neckline.

60
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,960
What a remarkable idea.

61
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,530
- No, I just...
- No, no, no, no.

62
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,530
Why stop at one outfit?

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,470
If I knew we had
an expert in our midst,

64
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,370
I would have relied
on you earlier.

65
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,470
Morgana?

66
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,640
Cora Hamilton,
perhaps you should

67
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,250
just, uh, curate
the entire shoot.

68
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,380
Now, while I don't mind
letting Sofia's daughter

69
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,920
play dress-up,

70
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,520
it might be stretching
the friendship

71
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,260
just a tad to give her my job.

72
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,520
Don't you think?

73
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,690
Cora?
Where are you going?

74
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,730

She's on a call at the moment.

86
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,800
She's doing damage control.

All my love, Aunt Margot.

92
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,090
Did you see his shoes?

93
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,870
This is a general announcement.

94
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,780
Flight 1138 bound
for Sydney, Australia,

95
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,620
your departure gate
is now changed to gate 26.

96
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,820
What on Earth do you
think you're doing?

97
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,720
Do you think I wouldn't
notice a $7,000 charge

98
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,690
for plane tickets to Australia?

99
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:09,530
I have got a catastrophe
on my hands

100
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,130
that affects both
of our reputations,

101
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,600
and you're running away.

102
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,840
Was this her idea?
- Aunt Margot's?

103
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,070
Yeah, of course.
I'm horrible.

104
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,140
She's the fun surfer aunt.

105
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,670
You know, I've barely heard
from her since Caleb died.

106
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,480
No, it wasn't her idea.

107
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,710
It was mine.

108
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,110
She's always written and said

109
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,910
that I'm welcome
to come stay whenever,

110
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,980
so I took her up on the offer.

111
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,990
She said she'd love to see me.

112
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,690
What? Is that
so surprising...

113
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,490
Someone actually
wanting to see me?

114
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:41,590
You know, taking a genuine
interest, asking them things,

115
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,600
wondering what they think,
maybe listening to them?

116
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,930
I'm running New York's
top model agency,

117
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,970
one that will launch
you into a career

118
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:51,600
that will take care
of you your entire life.

119
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:54,570
Darling, I cannot give you
my attention all the time.

120
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:57,640
I don't want your attention
all of the time.

121
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,210
But maybe once, you could
have made an exception,

122
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:04,780
done something I wanted to do
that was important to me.

123
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,750
I missed most of my childhood,

124
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,550
missed my graduation

125
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,820
so I could be
where you wanted me,

126
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,120
when you wanted me there.

127
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,890
I've fit into your life,

128
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:18,200
and now I'm doing something
on my own terms.

129
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,730
Sweetie, I know
that you're upset,

130
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:23,940
but people like us
can't afford accidents.

131
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,770
This was your chance
to show Morgana

132
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,540

not some melodramatic teen.

135
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:34,150
Why won't you listen to me?

136
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,720
Even when your daughter
is plastered on

it's like you
still can't see me.

139
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:42,090
Cora, you can't just
always run away.

140
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,890
I am not running away.

141
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:48,830
I am running towards

It'll be smooth as glass.

164
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,130
♪♪

165
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:01,660
You know, tai chi
is only beneficial

166
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:05,400
when you don't actively
work against it.

167
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,900
I'm not working against it.

168
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,740
It's working against me.

169
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,010
It calms the mind.

170
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:17,180
Imagine how much calmer you'd be
if you did it really quickly,

171
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,810
finished, and could
do something else.

172
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:23,080
You seem to be
missing the point.

173
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,950
You used to hate all this stuff.

174
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:29,220
The need for stillness
outweighed my ego.

175
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,260
Luckily, I don't have
that problem.

176
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:38,160
My life is a well-oiled machine.

177
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,200
All set to pick your
niece up this morning?

178
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,300
She doesn't get
in until tomorrow.

179
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,340
You said that yesterday,

180
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,310
and as its habit,

181
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:51,310
tomorrow is now today.

182
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:57,920
You've waited for 10 years
for her to come back,

183
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,850
and now you're gonna be late.

184
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,970
Breathe.

185
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,350
Cora?

186
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:34,150
Oh, my gosh! Look at you!

187
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,490
You're all grown up!

188
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,360
Sorry I'm late.

189
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,890
It's okay.

190
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:41,490
Oh, you're moving in, huh?

191
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,500
Uh, got to be prepared
for anything.

192
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,330
All you'll need is
your bathing suit.

193
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,830
Jump in.

194
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:50,470
You want to drive?

195
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,040
Oh.

196
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,510
- Thanks for having me.
- Of course.

197
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,940
It was a wonderful surprise.

198
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,880
Last-minute trip, huh?

199
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,110
Yeah. You know, things
are so busy right now.

200
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,180
If you get a chance for a
holiday, you got to take it.

201
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:07,490
Well, I'm glad you did.

202
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:10,160
So, what's the plan?

203
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,360
Oh, uh, no plan, really.

204
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,430
Just kind of gonna
see what happens.

205
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:19,230
What does your mom think
about you coming to stay?

206
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:22,030
Hey, you know, she thinks
it's a great idea.

207
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:25,200
Okay. Good.

208
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:27,540
How is your mom?

209
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,440
She's good.
She's fine.

210
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,110
Just always working.

211
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,920
It's a shame she couldn't
come out last year.

212
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,550
I'm so sorry about Caleb.

213
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:45,320
Well, that's life.

214
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,890
I should call Sof anyway.
It's been too long.

215
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,600
Sof.

216
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,300
That's really nice, actually.

217
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,570
Nobody back home calls her that.

218
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,470
Old habits die hard.

219
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:01,240
You remember when you were
here last with your mom?

220
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,180
Yeah.

221
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,110
Mom and I made a pact
we'd come and visit

222
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,280
every year after that trip,

223
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,350
but I guess life happened.

224
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:14,090
Well, you're here now.

Ohh.

00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,550
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

233
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,450
You better be
the new paper boy, Owen.

234
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:50,890
Margs, I just need
you to hear me out, okay?

235
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,770
I want to help you.
- Oh, do you hear that, Bee?

236
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,960
Owen wants to help out.
You can start with the bags,

237
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,530
and then, you know,
the lawn needs a mow.

238
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,630
Sell me the surf school,
and I'll do you a good deal.

239
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,330
You've only got
one instructor left.

240
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:01,430
The thing is just sitting there.

241
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:02,630
We had plenty of instructors

242
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,770
before you started
stealing them.

243
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:06,070
And don't call me Margs.
You know how much I hate it.

244
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,440
Hello, little fish.

245
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,340
Cora, you remember
my mother-in-law, Bee?

246
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,640
Yes, of course.

247
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,950
It's very nice to see you.

248
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,310
You're all grown up.

249
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,050
Listen, they
needed the work, okay?

250
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,580
Things have been
drying up here for months,

251
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,550
and Tom's a good kid,
but you're wasting his talent

252
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,250
on a handful of tourists.
- How many times

253
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,420
do we have to have
this conversation?

254
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,990
- Let's get your luggage.
- Margs.

255
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:28,060
Margot.

256
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,960
I'm just trying to help you.

257
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,130
Really?

258
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:34,130
Yeah. Really.

259
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:37,140
Because I do need help.

260
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,470
I'm overwhelmed.

261
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,710
I got all these surfboards,

262
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,970
and some of them
have a leg rope.

263
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,140
And I know it's called
a leg rope,

264
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,240
but do I put it on my leg
or my ankle?

265
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,610
And wet suits...
I know they get wet,

266
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:47,710
but sometimes they're dry.

267
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:50,650
What does it all mean, Owen?

268
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:52,320
Right.

269
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,450
Okay. I'm done.

270
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:57,360
Everyone, I tried.

271
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,030
I'm done.

272
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,660
You have a nice visit, Cora.

273
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,230
- Hi.
- You're taller.

274
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:05,730
See you later, Bee.

275
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:08,530
I'm sorry, hon.
Just ignore him.

276
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:10,130
Ignore them both.

277
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,740
A heads up would have been nice.

278
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,170
You don't have a mobile phone.
What was I supposed to do?

279
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:16,220
Send a pigeon?

280
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,250
I was gonna clean up today.

281
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,690
Oh.

282
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:31,590
Your place is very Boho-Chic.

283
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:35,030
It's not bad for
a couple of surfers, I guess.

284
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:37,260
Your aunt took out
the world championship

285
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,730
the year you were born.

286
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,300
- Really?
- Yeah.

287
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,100
And twice after that.

288
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,740
Margot is a world record holder.

289
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,440
I'm sure her mom has
bored her with that already.

290
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,740
Um, no, actually.

291
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,770
She has not.

292
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,010
I better get going.

293
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:54,580
This surf festival
is doing my nut.

294
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,100
All those geriatrics
organizing events.

295
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,520
Someone is gonna
pop their clogs.

296
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,750
I'll leave you to it.

297
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,390
Have fun.
- Okay.

298
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,490
Bye.

299
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:06,060
Uh, what's the festival?

300
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,660
Oh, well, surfing is
a way of life around here,

301
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,430
and this year is 100 years

302
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:12,600
since Bee's grandmother
paddled out

303
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,400
and surfed with the boys.

304
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,400
Violet was a bit
of a trailblazer.

305
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,300
So they're throwing her a party.

306
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,670
That's pretty cool.

307
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:23,270
Yeah. It is.
Now, come on.

308
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,480
Let's get you to your room.

309
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,650
Uh, okay.

310
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,550
Nothing much has changed.

311
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,120
Your drawings are
still on the wall.

312
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,260
And I found some of
your kids' books.

313
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,160
I better get that.

314
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,130
Uh, the bathroom
is down the hall.

315
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:43,490
The blue towels are yours.
Make yourself at home.

316
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,430
Hello?

317
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:49,800
How are you?

318
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,710
Why are you knocking?

319
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,380
You usually just walk in.

320
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,680
You have a guest.

321
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,580
Well, should I ask what that is?

322
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,350
It's a welcome gift.

323
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:14,690
You know, the ocean, sunshine,
"Welcome to Australia."

324
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:18,620
You're gonna give a girl
from New York a dead fish?

325
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,200
Well, now it seems weird.

326
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,740
Oh! You're purdy.

327
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,610
Owen dropped by
this morning.

328
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,840
- Again?
- Uh-huh.

329
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,710
Margot, you have a girl creeping
outside of your bathroom.

330
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:43,550
Oh, that's Chicka. She popped
in for lunch post-surf.

331
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,320
- 'Sup?
- Cora, this is Chicka,

332
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,350
who thinks my house is a hotel.

333
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,550
I ate your sandwich.

334
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,920
Sorry.
- And this is Tom...

335
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,390
Blue Soul's surf instructor.

336
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:56,630
- How you going?
- H-How am I going where?

337
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:57,960
Did you want a coffee?

338
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,440
Yes, please.

339
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,670
Oh. Okay.

340
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:07,840
Belinda, no, no, no, no, no.

341
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,880
No chickens in the kitchen.

342
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,280
Oh!

343
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,810
Honey, honey.

344
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:15,350
- Can you...? Thank you.
- N... uh.

345
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,450
- Yeah.
- Okay, it's...

346
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,890
- So, what did Owen want?
- Oh, the usual.

347
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:22,250
He wants to buy Blue Soul Surf,

348
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,290
the kit, you, our contracts.

349
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,630
- And what did you say?
- She said yes.

350
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:28,960
Owen's your father now.

351
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,500
I said no.

352
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,900
Cora, did you want to, you know,

353
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,500
check out the rock pools?

354
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,270
You used to love them
when you were a kid.

355
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,740
Oh, uh, thank you,

356
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,370
but I should actually
really check in back home.

357
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:43,410
Um, what's your Wi-Fi?

358
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,680
What?

359
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,650
Margot doesn't
have the Internet.

360
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,380
Doesn't have the Internet?

361
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:54,290
Like, i-is that 'cause you
call it something else...

362
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:55,370
Kangaroo line or something?

363
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,460
No, I'm just not great
with things like that.

364
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,890
Things like the 21st century?

365
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,930
It's nice not having
to be connected

366
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,930
to the rest of the world
when I'm at home.

367
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,670
It helps my Zen.

368
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:07,900
Zen?

369
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,800
But Tom set up Wi-Fi
at Blue Soul,

370
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,670
so you can, you know, pop down
there whenever you like.

371
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,840
Great. Yeah.

372
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,980
Uh, I'll just... I'll go change.

373
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,850
Are you gonna get changed, too?

374
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:25,420
'Cause I'm just gonna wear this.

375
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,860
Popping candy?

376
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:19,400
Every time I eat them, I just...

377
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:22,440
I imagine a bunch of guys
in suits in a boardroom

378
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,910
surrounded by takeaway boxes.

379
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,610
They're tired,

380
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:27,380
but then this one guy
slams his hand on the desk,

381
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,880
and he says, "I got it!

382
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,120
A candy that when you eat it

383
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,090
makes the sound
of frying onions!"

384
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:35,950
Then the other guys
are like, "Wow!

385
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,020
Yes! Good idea, Steve!"

386
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,100
Oh, I just... just
love popping candy.

387
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,900
So, who are you talking to?

388
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,530
I'm not talking to anyone.

389
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:52,570
Margot says you're
a bit of a fashionista.

390
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:55,370
Yeah, yeah,
I'm a model, actually.

391
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,110
Sweet.

392
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:59,410
I know a guy in New York.

393
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:02,810
His name's Patrick.

394
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:05,450
You know him?

395
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:07,850
There are over 8 million
people in New York.

396
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:09,590
Mm-hmm.

397
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,090
He always wears a hat.

398
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:16,000
No.

399
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,510
I'll let you get back
to your mates.

400
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,980
Hey, Mom.

401
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:37,580
I think I really focused up
on the plane here.

402
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,720
So, um...

403
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:49,430
I've just been...

404
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,430
I've been feeling...

405
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,730
I just...

406
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:56,870
Why don't you give me
a call when you get this?

407
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:58,740
You've reached
the office of Sofia Hamilton,

408
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,540
New York's premiere
modeling agent.

409
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,840
Please leave a message.

410
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,710
Everything all right?

411
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:11,890
Yeah. Fine. Just tired.

412
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,560
Max... e-mail...

413
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,230
Is okay with your short list
for Wednesday's job.

414
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:26,160
- No response.
- Jennifer...

415
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:29,200
Cellphone voicemail... wants...
- Anything from Cora?

416
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,840
No. Nothing from Cora.

417
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,140
What else?

418
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,140
Dobrovski...
Cellphone text...

419
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,580
"Moved meeting
to Tuesday morning."

420
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:40,760
You're free.
- Book it in.

421
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,820
What's wrong?

422
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,930
Something's bothering Cora.

423
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:56,660
I think a code coconut
is in order.

424
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:59,500
Well...

425
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,870
We'll need helmets.

426
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:03,270
Chicka was definitely
concussed last time.

427
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:16,510
Batter up!

428
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,120
- They can't be serious.
- Come on!

429
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,550
- Whoo!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

430
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,690
You can't be serious!

431
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:24,260
Whoa!

432
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,960
What am I supposed to do?

433
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,590
You've got a bat, woman.
Hit it.

434
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:30,290
You could have killed me.

435
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,860
It's all right.
We've got helmets on.

436
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:36,940
Eye on the coconut.

437
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,970
It'll make you feel better.
I promise.

438
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:41,010
Aim to hit it from underneath.
- Better about what?

439
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:44,840
Better about whatever you need
to feel better about.

440
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,710
Now, go low!
She's gonna lollipop it!

441
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:50,580
- Go!
- Whoo!

442
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:53,280
Come on!

It's time for the best part!

460
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:55,180
- Whoo!
- Catch you later!

461
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:58,650
Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

462
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,350
Come on!

463
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,360
What about sharks or jellyfish?

464
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,290
When's the last time
you went swimming?

465
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:07,660
In the ocean?

466
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,930
As a kid.

467
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:10,900
The last time
I was here, probably.

468
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,060
Well, then, it's about time.

469
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:14,630
It's nice as!

470
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,170
The air's different here.

471
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:27,470
I mean, it's, like, perfume.

472
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:30,140
It's a bit different
from New York, huh?

473
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,940
Margot said you model.

474
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:34,380
Yeah, yeah.
Teen fashion, mostly,

475
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,210
but Mom's been
training me for editorial.

476
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,420
Training? How hard can it be?

477
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,880
- Chicka.
- What?

478
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:41,420
You just lie around in clothes.

479
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:45,290
I do that all the time.
I'm doing it right now.

480
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,960
Yeah, it's... it's okay.

481
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,460
A lot of people think it's easy.

482
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:52,060
It actually requires
a surprising amount of work.

483
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,260
Sof must be very proud of you.

484
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:56,270
Yeah, well...

485
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,900
I might take a break from...

486
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,340
modeling soon, anyway.

487
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,310
Yeah, I don't blame you.

488
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:04,480
That video was pretty mean.

489
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,910
I mean...

490
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:08,820
It wasn't that bad.

491
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,420
Yeah, look, there are
a lot of people

492
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:17,460
who work really hard
to get the cover shoot.

493
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:21,190
If you make one mistake,
even if it's a little one,

494
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:23,190
it's the end of the world.

495
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,130
You know, it seems like you're

496
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:27,530
the most important person
in the room.

497
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:30,010
In actuality, you're nobody.

498
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:38,880
You can't be perfect
all the time.

499
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,850
I know a thing or two
about making mistakes

500
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:42,450
in front of a critical audience.

501
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:44,880
Oh, yeah.
Like that time you wiped out

502
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,550
in the Wahine's Women's Open.
- Chicka.

503
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:49,420
What? It was in the heats,
not even the final,

504
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:52,160
and she just, like,
completely ate it.

505
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,190
Thank you.
I forgot about that.

506
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:57,290
I did wipe out more than once.

507
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,500
Mm-hmm.

508
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,060
But every time I made a mistake,

509
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,470
I learned something...

510
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:05,300
Something about my technique
or my attitude,

511
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,300
who to trust.

512
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,810
Exactly.

513
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:10,880
And who cares what
those fancy pantses

514
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,810
in New York think, anyway?

515
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:16,080
I know it sounds silly,

516
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,420
but where I come from,

517
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:22,450
the fashion that we wear,
it's... it's just art.

518
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:24,050
It's pure art.

519
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,390
You should see what
these designers do.

520
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:30,160
They don't just buy fabrics
and follow a pattern.

521
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,530
I mean, they're architects.

522
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:34,130
They... They research,

523
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:36,000
and they're always
hunting down new materials

524
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,340
and seeking out ways to make it
all come together, you know?

525
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:45,410
You sound very passionate.

526
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:49,480
Yeah, I mean, it's
just my observations.

527
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,480
Here's an idea... Why don't you
two go for a surf tomorrow?

528
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,350
It's gonna be a beautiful day.

529
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:57,620
Sweet.
Yeah, let's do it.

530
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,490
I can't surf.

531
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:01,160
Oh, well, that's all right.

532
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,460
Neither could I before
I went out the first time.

533
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:13,310
Up.

534
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:18,880
Upright. Okay.
Move this back foot.

535
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,540
Breathe in.

536
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:23,250
Feel the movement of the water.

537
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:25,150
You are a part of the sea.

538
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:26,890
You are the current.

539
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:29,250
You are a jellyfish.

540
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:32,290
You are at one with the ocean.
You're a dolphin.

541
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:33,890
I don't think this is working.

542
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:36,390
Oh, well, this is
how Margot taught me.

543
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,400
Yeah, speaking of Margot,

544
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,460
maybe she can come out
with us next time.

545
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:42,330
Open your eyes!
And go, Cora! Go!

546
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:44,970
Paddle! Paddle!

547
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:50,380
Yeah, girl!

548
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:59,460
Whoo! Go, Cora!

549
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:17,670
- Hello?
- Margot.

550
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:20,040
Sof.

551
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,940
Hey, uh, how are you?

552
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,570
Fine.

553
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:27,410
Well, as fine as you can be
when your daughter skips town.

554
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:29,180
Oh, I thought as much.

555
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:32,450
Didn't seem like you to push
for a last-minute holiday.

556
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:36,520
I haven't heard
from you in a while.

557
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,960
I have tried to call.

558
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,260
Did you get the flowers
I sent for...

559
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,030
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

560
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:46,070
Thanks.

561
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:51,370
I meant to call back,
but, well, you know...

562
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:55,470
So, Cora grew up.

563
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:57,070
She's great, Sof.

564
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,640
She's... She's gorgeous.

565
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,380
Yeah, she is.
Is she all right?

566
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,080
Not getting in your way?

567
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,180
No, no, no, no. Not at all.

568
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,580
I mean, she was...

569
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,420
She was a bit out of sorts
when she arrived,

570
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,460
but actually,
she's out surfing right now.

571
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:14,760
- Wow. That sounds dangerous.
- It's strange.

572
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:18,430
It's kind of like having
my teen sister back again.

573
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:20,100
How's your, uh...
How's your work?

574
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,500
Uh, busy. How about you?

575
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:25,100
Yeah, yeah, tied up
with things here.

576
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:28,040
So, have you sold Blue Soul?

577
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,310
Why would I do that?

578
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,680
I thought
it wasn't going so well.

579
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,440
You don't know how
it's going, actually.

580
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:34,610
It's just basic
business principle.

581
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:35,850
It doesn't have to be personal.

582
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:37,620
Of course it's personal.

583
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:42,120
Isn't that why you deigned
to visit us last time?

584
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,590
Because you were
struggling with work,

585
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,790
and you needed a break?
Because sometimes it's personal.

586
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,430
I'm sorry to cut this short,

587
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:51,460
but I'm being hassled
by my next appointment.

588
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,660
I just wanted to see
if Cora was all right.

589
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:57,370
I'm glad she's okay and that
you're both having fun together.

590
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:59,040
I'll talk to you later.

591
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:02,070
Okay. Sof, I...

592
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,580
Sof?

593
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,350
Cora. You're doing well.

594
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,390
I think Chicka's
trying to kill me

595
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:18,090
and make it look
like an accident.

596
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:19,720
I've seen worse first attempts.

597
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:20,820
Well, thanks.

598
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,830
Who are they?
- Wave Masters.

599
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:30,470
Only other surf school
in Tea Tree.

600
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:32,200
Come on, guys. Let's go.
Come on.

601
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,510
All right, grab it now.
Now, let's move it, move it.

602
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:38,340
Come on, guys. Follow me.
We're heading down to the beach.

603
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,740
Let's go, go, go.

604
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,810
Hey, that guy was
at Margot's the other day.

605
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:43,510
Yeah, Owen.

606
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:46,250
He's been trying to get Margot
to sell for a while.

607
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:47,720
She's having none of it.

608
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,420
You want to boost my numbers?

609
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:56,390
Join my lesson tomorrow?

610
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,430
Tell you what, if Chicka
gets taken by a shark,

611
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:00,230
you will be my first call.

612
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:10,710
Before you say anything,
this wasn't my idea.

613
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:13,240
I didn't want to be the head
of the festival committee.

614
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:17,310
No, Frank, we are not having
a Guess Your Weight stand.

615
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,850
Why not?

616
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:21,790
Beryl, how much do you weigh?

617
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:25,260
- Excuse me.
- That's why.

618
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,790
I thought Dolores was
head of the committee.

619
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:29,360
Well, she was until she had
the nerve to jump ship.

620
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,600
- Dolores has moved?
- She's on holiday.

621
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,300
She's in Cairns.

622
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,700
The details are not important.

623
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,430
We just have to band together,

624
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,370
and if I'm stuck with them,
you're stuck with them.

625
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:39,740
What's wrong with your house?

626
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:42,310
Darling!
Wonderful!

627
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:44,580
We need your fashion eye.

628
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,480
This is the one
I was talking about.

629
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,180
She works in fashion
in New York.

630
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:53,420
We are putting together
a vintage swimsuit display

631
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,650
that spans 100 years.

632
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:58,660
What do you think?
We can't get it to work.

633
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:01,430
It's not supposed
to hang like a sack.

634
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:06,330
Yeah, uh, I don't
really do this, so...

635
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:09,570
I'll... I'll let you guys to it.
- No, no, no, no.

636
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:12,700
Don't you worry about
hurting our feelings.

637
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,910
What do you think?

638
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:18,680
I mean, honestly?

639
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,480
Yes, yes, darling.

640
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,550
Hmm.

641
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,310
Ready, Mommy?

642
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:53,450
To begin, I'm gonna need
a sewing machine.

643
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:58,980
Now, the idea is to show

644
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:01,220
different eras
of swim wear fashion,

645
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,950
but all ideas are welcome.

646
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,890
Aha! Here we go.

647
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:09,630
Ohh! Now...

648
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,700
this was Grandma Violet's,

old eucalyptus tree

It had a little magpie in it,

it would warble away.

Why did you hate the pool?

it would be like I was okay
with the tree being gone,

and I wasn't.
I was still angry.

But I realized there were
things to be happy about,

Oh, is it? Is it heaps better?

Well, is there anything else

No. What? No.

Uh, I just thought that...

Why don't you take over
and design the whole thing?

818
00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:28,760
Come on, Cora.
She didn't mean to upset you.

819
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,690
Dressing up is
supposed to be fun.

820

You think this is
just dress-up?

821

What's her problem?

Ah!

What's going on in there?

824
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:44,640
She ruined my design.

825
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,210
And talking to her like
that's gonna fix it?

826
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:49,050
She hacked it to pieces.

827

Well, I don't know.
Does she have a point?

828
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:53,050
A point?
It's like you people

829

"You people."

It's these people
that have embraced you

832
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:01,430
and asked you to help out
with their festival.

833
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:03,290
What have your people
done for you, Cora?

834
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:06,460
Pushed you around,
spread rumors about you?

835
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:10,300
You're right. My people
are nothing like your people.

Aunt Margot, did you

Never.

841
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:45,500
Yes.

Oh, all the time.

Blue Soul nearly killed us
more than once.

977
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:37,450
Huh.

978
01:01:37,450 --> 01:01:39,790
So a guy can wait around, then.

979
01:01:39,790 --> 01:01:42,460
I wasn't waiting for
you to come back,

980
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:44,510
but I'm glad you did.

981
01:02:11,990 --> 01:02:14,320
Hello, you've reached 1955.

982
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:17,790
There's no Internet
but great gas prices.

983
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,800
Darling, it's me.

984
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:22,930
- Mom?
- How are you?

985
01:02:22,930 --> 01:02:24,900
- Good. Great.
- That's good.

986
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:27,340
It's lovely to hear your voice.

987
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:29,310
Yeah. Yours, too.

988
01:02:29,310 --> 01:02:30,470
I have to
say the apartment

989
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:32,180
is very quiet without you.

990
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:34,580
But I have some
very exciting news.

991
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:36,140
What's up?

992
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:37,950
Well, I've been
working like a dog

993
01:02:37,950 --> 01:02:40,580
to get you that contract,
and guess what.

994
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:42,290
Morgana wants you to launch her

995
01:02:42,290 --> 01:02:44,350
upcoming New York campaign.

996
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:48,960
So, uh, wait,
what does this mean?

997
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,190
This means
you have a new chance,

998
01:02:51,190 --> 01:02:52,670
and I think your trip
to Australia has

999
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,460
actually been a good thing
for both of us...

1000
01:02:55,460 --> 01:02:58,300
A new perspective, some time
away to work things out.

1001
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:00,540
But you'll need to come home
as soon as possible.

1002
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:02,570
Lily is booking flights
as we speak.

1003
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:04,110
We can get you
on a plane tonight.

1004
01:03:04,110 --> 01:03:06,040
Wh... Tonight?

1005
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:09,110
Th... That's so soon. I-I can't.

1006
01:03:09,110 --> 01:03:11,510
Morgana wants
to see you on Tuesday.

1007
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:13,580
Look, I'm sure
the schedule is tight,

1008
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:16,520
but there's this festival...

1009
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:19,190
This is a chance for you
to wipe your slate clean,

1010
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:21,320
and I want to help you do that.

1011
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:23,360
Lily will send through
the flight details.

1012
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:24,960
Oh, my appointment's here.
I got to run.

1013
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:26,390
Call me on your way
to the airport.

1014
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,000
Bye, darling.

1015
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:51,050
I can't believe this.

1016
01:03:51,050 --> 01:03:52,990
What?

1017
01:03:54,990 --> 01:03:59,390
That I actually thought that
I could stay here, have this.

1018
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:02,930
Have what?

1019
01:04:02,930 --> 01:04:04,930
That was my mom.

1020
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:06,570
My modeling contract's back on,

1021
01:04:06,570 --> 01:04:09,410
so I have to go
back to New York.

1022
01:04:09,410 --> 01:04:12,170
You're leaving?

1023
01:04:12,170 --> 01:04:17,350
I was always gonna have
to leave eventually.

1024
01:04:17,350 --> 01:04:19,980
You... You get some
modeling thing and you...

1025
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:21,220
You go?

1026
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:23,080
It's not just
some modeling thing.

1027
01:04:23,090 --> 01:04:25,490
I mean, it's...
It's a really big contract.

1028
01:04:25,490 --> 01:04:26,690
You know...

1029
01:04:26,690 --> 01:04:29,030
If that's what you want.

1030
01:04:30,030 --> 01:04:31,490
I've worked years for this.

1031
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,130
I thought modeling
made you unhappy.

1032
01:04:33,130 --> 01:04:35,630
It does. Sometimes. But...

1033
01:04:35,630 --> 01:04:38,030
- But what?
- I'm not like you.

1034
01:04:38,030 --> 01:04:40,300
I can't just give up
a good opportunity

1035
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:43,240
because it got too hard.

1036
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:44,550
What does that mean?

1037
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:54,080
It means the keys
aren't locked up, Tom.

1038
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:55,980
Okay, nothing is stopping you
from going in there

1039
01:04:55,990 --> 01:04:58,090
and finishing that board.

1040
01:05:01,090 --> 01:05:02,090
Tom.

1041
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,070
Hey. What's wrong?

1042
01:05:13,070 --> 01:05:15,010
I got the contract
with Morgana Ferzari.

1043
01:05:16,010 --> 01:05:18,540
Well, congratulations.

1044
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:23,980
But what about design?

1045
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:26,380
I'm really sick of people
telling me what is

1046
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:28,720
and is not my dream,
especially when no one here

1047
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:30,290
has the courage to actually
do what they love.

1048
01:05:30,290 --> 01:05:31,690
I'm just saying don't be afraid

1049
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:33,220
to do the thing
that's gonna make you happy.

1050
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:36,730
Yeah, says the pro surfer
who doesn't even surf.

1051
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:39,130
Look, I walk around
this place and Blue Soul,

1052
01:05:39,130 --> 01:05:42,600
and it's like I can
almost still feel Caleb.

1053
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:46,470
But it's this dark
and sad version of him.

1054
01:05:46,470 --> 01:05:48,770
It's so heavy. No wonder you're
afraid to get in the water.

1055
01:05:48,770 --> 01:05:50,470
You'll probably sink.

1056
01:05:50,470 --> 01:05:52,110
I lost my husband.

1057
01:05:52,110 --> 01:05:54,640
Yeah, you don't want
to sell the school,

1058
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:56,110
but you don't want to run it.

1059
01:05:56,110 --> 01:05:57,450
You don't want Tom
to work with Owen,

1060
01:05:57,450 --> 01:05:59,720
but you don't want him
to work for you.

1061
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:01,720
It's like you're stuck.

1062
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:05,750
Why don't you look around
and see all of the people

1063
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:07,760
who are willing to be
stuck with you?

1064
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:34,220
Whoa. Sorry, miss.

1065
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:36,220
This is way too heavy.
You can't take this.

1066
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:37,490
We got to go.

1067

front coming in.

I couldn't go.

I'm so scared

1077

What are you doing here?

1186
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:10,910
I came to apologize.

1187
01:19:10,910 --> 01:19:14,440
For not listening to you
when you needed to be heard.

1188
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:18,910
Mom, my heart isn't
in modeling anymore.

1189
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:20,450
But that doesn't mean
that I don't love you

1190
01:19:20,450 --> 01:19:23,550
and appreciate everything
you've done for me.

1191
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:26,820
When someone runs headlong
into the ocean during a storm,

1192
01:19:26,820 --> 01:19:29,890
rather than getting on a plane
to fame and fortune,

1193
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:31,650
I guess they're trying
to tell you something.

1194
01:19:34,030 --> 01:19:36,430
I'm so proud of you.

1195
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:49,480
Deep down, I think I knew
modeling wasn't your first love.

1196
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:52,210
But you're my first love.

1197
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:54,250
And I wanted you to be
as close to me as possible

1198
01:19:54,250 --> 01:19:57,220
for as long as possible.

1199
01:19:57,220 --> 01:19:59,320
You know, designing's
no walk in the park.

1200
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:02,520
You've just jumped from
the frying pan into the fire.

1201
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:04,090
I know.

1202
01:20:04,090 --> 01:20:05,890
And I can't wait.

1203
01:20:05,890 --> 01:20:07,390
Cora!

1204
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:10,400
My friend Patrick liked
your designs on Instagram!

1205
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,030
Wait, Patrick Delamore?!

1206
01:20:12,030 --> 01:20:14,470
Yeah! Yeah, I told you.

1207
01:20:14,470 --> 01:20:16,400
He's one of the most iconic
fashion photographers

1208
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:17,940
of our time.

1209
01:20:17,940 --> 01:20:19,340
Oh, so you do know Patty Cakes?

1210
01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:20,940
Hey, I'll give you his number.

1211
01:20:20,940 --> 01:20:22,510
Maybe he'll post
some of your clothes.

1212
01:20:22,510 --> 01:20:25,980
Let's go!

1213
01:20:26,980 --> 01:20:29,210
Sof.

1214
01:20:50,210 --> 01:20:51,670
What are they doing?

1215
01:20:51,670 --> 01:20:53,540
Something they should
have done ages ago.

1216
01:20:53,540 --> 01:20:55,110
Margot's selling Blue Soul?

1217
01:20:55,110 --> 01:20:58,150
No. They're gonna join forces.

1218
01:20:58,150 --> 01:21:00,480
Margot's starting a pro
surf school for women,

1219
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,220
like she always wanted,

1220
01:21:02,220 --> 01:21:05,390
and Owen is taking over
the day-to-day students.

1221
01:21:08,390 --> 01:21:10,960
