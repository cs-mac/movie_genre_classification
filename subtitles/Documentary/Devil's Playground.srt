1
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,520
Go on, Barbara.

2
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,320
We go back to our homeroom for dismissal.

3
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,480
Unless you have a pass for sports or something.

4
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,080
Is that what you did on the day in question?

5
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,720
No. Mr. Gettys asked me to stay after class.

6
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,000
What happened next, Barbara?

7
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,040
He told me to sit in the chair beside his desk.

8
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,520
If you will, in your own words, tell us exactly
what happened in the next few minutes.

9
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,760
I told him I was afraid I'd miss my bus.

10
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,680
He promised I'd get to the bus on time
if I'd help him do something.

11
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,840
Before I could say anything,
he placed his hand inside my blouse.

12
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,960
I was so frightened. I didn't move.
I thought if I was just qulet it'd be okay.

13
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,840
Then his other hand went up under inside my skirt.

14
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,760
Then, with his hand...

15
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,720
he started moving back and forth...

16
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,680
farther and farther inside my skirt.

17
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,320
He said he was testing to see
if I had any special feelings...

18
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,440
that he wanted to see what kind of feelings I had.

19
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,480
I was trying to think of something to say, but I couldn't.

20
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,840
I was confused, and he just kept on.

21
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,280
I asked him to stop, but it was Like he couldn't hear me.

22
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,920
He just kept on with his hand.

23
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,200
Then I screamed.

24
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,080
Then he got mad and said we'd have
to try it again sometime.

25
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,600
Did he try again?

26
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,840
Not with me.

27
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,960
But with your friends?

28
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,680
Yes.

29
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,920
And after you had told them what he had done to you...

30
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,960
they told you what he had done to them!

31
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,400
Isn't that true?

32
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,680
Yes.

33
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,520
I have nothing further.

34
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,280
Your witness, Mr. Lomax.

35
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,400
Any chance, Your Honor, for a short recess?

36
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,720
Of course.

37
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,600
This court will be in recess for 15 minutes.

38
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,560
- What...
- Not now, Bernice.

39
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,560
Lomax, what's wrong?

40
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,560
As your attorney, I'm advising you
to keep the fuck away from me.

41
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,640
Why? What are you talking about?

42
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,400
The wife, the kid, the outrage.
You definitely had me fooled.

43
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,720
Hey, you're my Lawyer.

44
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,320
You're here to defend me.

45
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,800
You know what I'm thinking?

46
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,320
Why not put you on the stand?
You can jerk off for the judge.

47
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,320
- You know she's lying.
- Get the hell away from me.

48
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,360
Well, hell, there you are.

49
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,560
Rumor was you were out wandering in traffic.

50
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,440
Not now, Larry.

51
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,160
What's the game plan?

52
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,160
I got a 4:30 deadline. I need a quote.

53
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,720
Give me a quote.

54
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,840
Fuck off.

55
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,280
''Mr. Lomax had no comment on today's events.

56
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,240
Speculation, however, was widespread...

57
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,720
that the young Lawyer's unblemished string of victories...

58
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,560
would come to an end...

59
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,360
in this courtroom. ''

60
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,640
It was a nice run, Kev.

61
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,640
Had to close out someday.

62
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,240
Nobody wins them all.

63
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,760
Have you had any discipline problems
in math class this year?

64
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,360
No.

65
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,440
No?

66
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,280
Hasn't Mr. Gettys had to talk to you
repeatedly about your behavior?

67
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,120
Isn't that why he asked you to stay after class?

68
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,360
No!

69
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,520
Have other teachers asked you to stay after class?

70
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,840
Once or twice.

71
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,920
Did they want to talk to you about your behavior?

72
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,600
Objection. Immaterial.

73
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,760
- Goes to motive.
- Overruled.

74
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,120
You may answer the question.

75
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,440
I don't know what the other teachers wanted.

76
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,360
You'd have to talk to them.

77
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,080
You ever pass notes in class?

78
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,080
Maybe a note that...

79
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,040
made fun of Mr. Gettys?

80
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,320
No.

81
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,480
No?

82
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,160
Never called him a ''disgusting pig monster''?

83
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,520
Order.

84
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,800
No.

85
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,080
Your Honor, I've pre-marked this Defense Exhibit A.

86
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,360
Objection. We've had plenty of time for discovery here.

87
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,640
I'm going to let this in, Mr. Lomax.

88
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,240
I'm also going to suggest that if
you have any other exhibits...

89
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,520
you present them in a timely fashion, or not at all.

90
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm sorry, Barbara, I was wrong.

91
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,160
It's ''huge hog beast''.

92
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,240
This is your handwriting, isn't it?

93
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,600
- Yes, but...
- You wrote this in Gettys' class.

94
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,760
It's a joke.

95
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,840
''He's a huge hog beast.

96
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,760
He probably eats a thousand pancakes for breakfast. ''

97
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,840
You're writing about Mr. Gettys, aren't you?

98
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,960
It was meant to be a joke.

99
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,360
Have you ever had a party at your house, Barbara...

100
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,080
when your parents were away?

101
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,880
Objection. Your Honor...

102
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,520
Credibility and bias.

103
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,040
Overruled.

104
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,200
Answer the question.

105
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,360
Yes.

106
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,560
Have you ever heard of a game called ''Special Places''?

107
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,720
You're under oath, Barbara.

108
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,800
A man's career...

109
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,480
his reputation...

110
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,400
his life is on the line.

111
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,200
This is not a joke.

112
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,200
Have you ever played ''Special Places''?

113
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,240
Yes.

114
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,920
Is this game sexual in nature?

115
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,560
Is this game sexual in nature?

116
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,840
We only played it once.

117
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,840
This special party, Barbara...

118
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,440
this was the first time you told the story
about Mr. Gettys, wasn't it?

119
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,560
Yes.

120
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,760
I've spoken to other children
who were there that day.

121
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,840
Is there anything else they may
have told me about the party?

122
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,440
Objection! If he has other witnesses,
Let him call them!

123
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,400
If I need to call those other children, I will!

124
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,280
I'm going to sustain that, Mr. Lomax.

125
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,560
Rephrase your question.

126
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,440
You threatened those children, didn't you?

127
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,000
That's not the way it happened.

128
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,440
You told them to lie, to falsely claim
that Mr. Gettys had hurt them.

129
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,160
These things did happen.

130
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,880
If they didn't, you were going to tell
everyone about this special party.

131
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,640
They happened to me.

132
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,600
So you made up a story. A special story.

133
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,400
A story about a math teacher...

134
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,080
who was tough on you, who kept you after class.

135
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,680
A ''huge hog beast'' you didn't Like!

136
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,320
That's what really happened, isn't it?

137
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,440
No.

138
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,440
I didn't want to be the only one.

139
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,440
You goddamn lowlife, son of a bitch...

140
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,200
No further questions, Your Honor.

141
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,400
I'm going to adjourn for the day.

142
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,920
We'll be back here at 9:00 a. m.
and people will behave themselves...

143
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,640
You made me proud.

144
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,960
or find themselves in contempt.

145
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,400
Pack it up, baby. You need a drink.

146
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:20,280
In the event that we all get drunk,
Let's front-load the ceremonial bullshit.

147
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,720
To the best trial Lawyer in Alachua County.

148
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,280
Damn straight.

149
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,200
So, Kev, off the record...

150
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,200
How's it feel to squeeze a man Like Gettys...

151
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,800
through the door of reasonable doubt?

152
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,080
Why don't you quit being a party pooper.
Have yourself a drink.

153
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,800
We're not going to discuss the damn case anymore.

154
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,960
Am I right?

155
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,680
I'll drink to that.

156
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,280
No shop talk.

157
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,120
Pour me another.

158
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,760
Lomax, you're wild.

159
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,480
I feel one of them nights coming on.

160
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,320
''I've seen the Taj Mahal I've even been to China''

161
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,360
I've got to go piss!

162
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,520
I've got to go piss!

163
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,480
Hurry!

164
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,360
Hell of a job today.

165
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,680
I don't want to disturb your party.

166
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,040
''Milton-Chadwick-Waters. ''

167
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,760
Never heard of it.

168
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,200
What are you going to do? Sue me?

169
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,680
Actually, we were hoping to retain your services.

170
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,040
We've been following your progress.

171
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,360
From New York?

172
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,400
You've never lost a case.

173
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,680
I've had some sympathetic juries.

174
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,120
That's exactly what we're looking for.

175
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,280
We want you to come to New York, help us pick a jury.

176
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,160
I tell you, man...

177
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,440
you're pretty damn good.

178
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,720
Your card is great.

179
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,400
You being black...

180
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,400
Whose idea was that? Paul's?

181
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,040
That's just brilliant.

182
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,880
I'm just not drunk enough yet to fall for it.

183
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,800
I'll buy you a drink when I...

184
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,880
You'd have to start next week.

185
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:35,160
All expenses, first-class travel and lodging,
you and your wife.

186
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,800
A lump-sum payment, regardless
of the verdict, in the amount of...

187
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,280
Take a Look.

188
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:09,320
In the name of Lord Jesus,
we refute you, Satan, and cast you out.

189
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,640
Amen.

190
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,240
''Romans 16:19

191
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,800
Be ever at what is good

192
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,840
Be innocent

193
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,000
Of evil

194

And the God of Peace will soon crush Satan

195

Yes, God will crush him underneath your feet

And the God of Peace will soon crush Satan

Yes, God will crush him underneath your feet''

198
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,760
All the way to New York just to pick a jury.

199
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,840
Every dog gets his day.

200
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,800
Why do I feel the hand of Mary Ann on this adventure?

201
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,680
I gotta tell you, Ma, this routine's getting awful tired.

202
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,640
Working on Sunday.

203
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,360
Working? Ma, get over it.

204
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,560
Listen to me. I Love my wife.

205
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,200
Okay? I Love her all the way.

206
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,400
Just Like you.

207
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,040
Let me tell you about New York.

208
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,040
''Fallen, fallen, is Babylon.

209
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,040
It has become a dwelling place of demons. ''

210
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,720
''Revelation 18. ''

211
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,040
Wouldn't hurt you to Look it over.

212
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,120
- Couldn't forget it if I tried.
- Oh, really?

213
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,280
And what happened to Babylon?

214
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,160
''Thou mighty city, in one hour has
thy mighty judgement come.

215
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,840
And the Light of a single Lamp
shall shine in thee no more. ''

216
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,440
Wish me Luck.

217
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,320
Good Luck.

218
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,800
I'll miss you.

219
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,160
Jeannie, Listen to me now.
I've gone the extra miIe with you on this.

220
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,080
I'm trying to work with you.

221
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:10,000
They'll be Looking for that payment and
if it's not there, they'll repo the car.

222
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,120
Okay, I gotta go.

223
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,880
Look, Jeannie, I gotta make a plane.
Just get yourself on schedule.

224
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,560
Okay. Make the payment.

225
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,800
Let me guess. It's all my idea, right?

226
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,080
We better give her some grandkids soon
so I can get her off my back.

227
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,640
What do you say?

228
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,360
Let her sweat a little.

229
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,400
All right, Mr. Clintine, Let me ask you this:
Do you think, as a juror...

230
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:26,480
you'd be able to set aside any prior opinion you
might hold about the savings and loan industry?

231
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,920
That was a question, sir.

232
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,040
What? Do I Like bankers?

233
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,200
Your Honor, may I have a minute
to confer with my colleagues?

234
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,440
You may.

235
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,680
Dump him.

236
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,200
Let's get rid of Number four, six...

237
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,040
I'd say lose Number twelve...

238
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,120
but the prosecutor's gonna fuck up and do it for us.

239
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,720
Number six?

240
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,080
You're kidding, right?
She's my first choice.

241
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,720
She's my first pass.

242
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,120
And four?

243
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,720
With the dreadlocks? That's crazy.

244
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,360
- That's a defendant's juror.
- Did you see his shoes?

245
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,640
Look, kid, maybe down in Florida
you are the next big thing.

246
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,040
This is New York. We're not squeezing oranges here.

247
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,320
He polishes those shoes every night.
He makes his own clothes.

248
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:30,560
He Looks Like a brother with an attitude,
but I see a man with a gun under his bed.

249
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,880
And woe betide the creature who steps into his garden.

250
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,480
Number six...

251
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,480
your favorite...

252
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,360
she's damaged goods.

253
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,840
She's a Catholic schoolteacher.

254
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,160
Believes in human frailty...

255
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,600
No. Something's missing from her.

256
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,920
She's wrong.

257
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,280
She wants on this jury.

258
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,840
Somebody hurt her and she wants revenge.

259
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,360
How the hell do you know that?

260
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,600
I don't know.

261
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,800
Either you put a stop to this happy horseshit or I walk.

262
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,080
Walk.

263
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:14,080
Here's the deal: if I Lose with your jury,
you do the explaining.

264
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,880
Your Honor, may I continue?

265
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,200
We'd Like to excuse Jurors three, four and six.

266
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,480
Hi. You're home early for a change.

267
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,240
Your mother called.

268
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,160
She has her ''bad feeling''.

269
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,120
Every now and then, she gets one right.

270
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,800
You okay?

271
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,000
Something's up.

272
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,600
They deliberated for 38 minutes.

273
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,680
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

274
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:56,440
What the hell did they expect?
The man is as guilty as can be.

275
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,680
Wasn't a jury anywhere gonna Let him off.

276
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,680
Yeah.

277
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,920
Except one.

278
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,280
What?

279
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,600
Not fucking guilty!

280
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,440
Oh, my God! You lying...

281
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,960
sack of shit!

282
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,120
Thirty-eight minutes, my jury!

283
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,560
Thirty-eight minutes!

284
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,360
- You did it!
- My jury! I'm too good!

285
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,200
- Glad you could stick around.
- It's your dime.

286
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,440
Sorry to keep you waiting.

287
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,000
Mr. Milton got pinned down in Indonesia
longer than expected.

288
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,960
Good morning, Caprice.

289
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,160
Good morning, Mr. Heath.

290
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,520
Your messages.

291
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,800
Not bad, huh?

292
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,480
You can play it cool if you want...

293
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,720
but when I first walked in, my jaw was on the floor.

294
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,320
This is our home office.

295
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,000
We have many international arrangements...

296
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,720
so Mr. Milton spends a great deal of his time in the air.

297
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,280
Three o'clock, we got the Greeks.

298
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,280
Am I a good cop or a bad cop?

299
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,120
We may not need a good cop.

300
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,320
I Love it.

301
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:16,080
In addition to our corporate clients we're
representing 25 foreign countries:

302
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,280
The Mideast, the Balkans, Central America, West Africa...

303
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,920
Interesting work, but travel-intensive.

304
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,560
Behind you.

305
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,280
I'm sorry.

306
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,160
Please. Kevin Lomax.

307
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,840
John Milton.

308
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,280
Nice to meet you.

309
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,800
So?

310
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,720
Have we been treating you well?

311
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,920
Very well, thank you.

312
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
And your wife, she's had a good time?

313
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,600
She sure has. It's been great.
The whole thing's been great.

314
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,720
That's our secret:

315
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,720
Kill you with kindness.

316
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,720
What's your secret?

317
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,880
I couldn't say.

318
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,680
You were a prosecutor.

319
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:00,480
Out of law school.
Five years in the Jacksonville D. A. 's office.

320
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,960
Sixty-four straight convictions.

321
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,840
What a number!

322
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,120
I Like to be in court.

323
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,160
I didn't plea out a lot.

324
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,320
What's that Like?

325
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,600
One day you put them away,
the next you set them free.

326
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,240
Takes a little getting used to.

327
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,960
Pays better, though, doesn't it?

328
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,680
Yes, it does.

329
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:29,720
That math teacher, the Gettys case...
now I hear you were brilliant.

330
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,320
Prosecutor dropped the ball.

331
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,480
Really?

332
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,000
You think your guy was guilty?

333
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,360
I didn't say that.

334
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,720
What'd you say?

335
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,240
How's this:

336
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,680
I began the case with a clear conscience.

337
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,920
I was sure you had a secret.

338
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,720
The men's room.

339
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,600
Upstairs men's room in the Duval County courthouse.

340
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,360
There's a hole in the wall to the next room.

341
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,320
I spent five years Listening to juries deliberate.

342
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,240
- I Love it.
- Love it all you want.

343
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,600
Just don't repeat it.

344
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,160
I'm not sure the Florida Bar Association would appreciate it.

345
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,200
My lips are sealed.

346
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,800
You don't really want to go back to Florida, do you?

347
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,320
Walk with me.

348
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,280
What do you think?

349
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,400
Some people can't handle it.

350
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,200
It's peaceful.

351
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,520
My sentiments exactly.

352
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,000
Fill in the resume for me.
Tell me, your father, what does he do?

353
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,880
I never got to know my father.
He passed away before I was born.

354
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,520
My mother raised me. Just the two of us.

355
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,960
She never remarried?

356
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,200
She wasn't married the first time.

357
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,680
That can't be easy in a town Like Gainesville, can it?

358
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,680
I don't think it's easy anywhere.

359
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,160
Holy shit!

360
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,560
Different when you're Looking down, isn't it?

361
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,360
Yes, it is.

362
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,600
Oh, my God.

363
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,280
Your mother...

364
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,000
what's she Like?

365
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,400
She's a preacher's daughter. She's tough.

366
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,080
She's worked in a poultry plant
for as long as I can remember.

367
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,240
She's got a church she really Likes,
so she's usually there or they go out...

368
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,320
They do a lot of volunteer work.

369
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,080
''Behold, I send you out as sheep amidst the wolves. ''

370
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,080
So they say.

371
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,080
It didn't rub off?

372
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,920
The Book? The Church?

373
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,920
No, I'm on parole.

374
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,600
Early release for time served.

375
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,720
A lot of potential clients down there.

376
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,680
Are we negotiating?

377
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,720
Always.

378
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,440
Can I ask you a question, then?

379
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,760
Why do you need a criminal department?

380
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,680
Our clients break the law Like anyone else.

381
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,400
I'm just tired of sending their business across the street.

382
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,120
- Are you offering me a job?
- I'm thinking about it.

383
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:39,240
I know you've got talent.
I knew that before you got here.

384
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:43,120
It's just the other thing I wonder about.

385
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,800
What thing?

386
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,040
Pressure.

387
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,320
It changes everything. Pressure.

388
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,640
Some people, you squeeze them, they focus.

389
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,480
Others fold.

390
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,960
Can you summon your talent at will?

391
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,640
Can you deliver on a deadline?

392
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,720
Can you sleep at night?

393
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,080
When do we talk about money?

394
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,280
Money?

395
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,120
That's the easy part.

396
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,200
They call this part of Fifth Avenue, Carnegie Hill.

397
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,120
You've got the park right across the street, and the reservoir.

398
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,880
Best jogging in New York.

399
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,720
Mount Sinai Hospital is up the street.

400
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,480
Some excellent schools.

401
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,080
Not on the top of Mr. Milton's list
when he bought this building...

402
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,600
but great neighborhood for children.

403
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,000
Great building.

404
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,640
Follow the money all the way to the top.

405
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,160
You've got the managing director, Eddie Barzoon, on 16.

406
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,040
And, of course, Mr. Milton has the tower.

407
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,120
- You must be Mary Ann?
- Yes, I am.

408
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,520
Welcome. I'm Jackie Heath.

409
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,440
It's nice of you to come by.

410
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,840
Oh, please. We Live across the hall.

411
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,960
- You're kidding.
- Right there.

412
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,400
It's just two apartments per floor?

413
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,400
- You didn't tell them about it?
- It can speak for itself.

414
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,880
Voila!

415
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,360
Oh, my God!

416
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,000
It's what they call a ''Classic Eight''.

417
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,800
Be careful. I don't have a map.
I don't want you to get Lost.

418
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,320
We had them paint it white. Let you see it
naked before you pick your palette.

419
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,640
What am I picking?

420
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,120
Palette. Your colors.

421
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,200
Oh, yes.

422
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,960
I need to warn you about one thing.

423
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:42,040
There are going to be some very envious
people down at the firm.

424
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,840
There aren't many of these apartments.
They're a partner's perk.

425
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,200
You must've made quite an impression.

426
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,160
Oh, my God, three bedrooms.
You know what that means?

427
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,840
Bables.

428
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,240
It took us six years to get in here.

429
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,000
Unbelievable.

430
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,600
Thank you very much.

431
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,960
Are you really this good?

432
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,680
I sure as hell hope so.

433
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,040
They must want you pretty bad.

434
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,040
Look, Mar...

435
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,280
I'm only getting behind this if you're on board.

436
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,280
If you want to go home...

437
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,280
I'm with you.

438
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,720
Sure.

439
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,200
Let's go back to Gainesville, back to the condo.

440
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:38,760
You keep scrounging for clients and I'll
keep repossessing cars for Akamian.

441
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:42,400
And maybe, just maybe, if we kill ourselves...

442
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:48,080
in about five years we can afford a baby
and a weekend shack at Gulf Shores.

443
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,240
Are you shitting me?

444
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,240
I Love you.

445
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,400
I Love you, too.

446
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,480
Tadashi Osumi, Media.

447
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,600
Walter Krasna, Maritime Law.

448
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,840
Bashir Toabal, Energy Law.

449
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,680
I run the Islamic subgroup.

450
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,600
Joyce Rensaleer, Mergers and Acquisitions.

451
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,800
Eddie Barzoon, Managing Director and...

452
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,920
Real Estate.

453
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,680
Pradeed Resh, Intellectual Properties.

454
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:26,280
Christabella Andrioti, International Trade and Customs...

455
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,920
EC and G-7.

456
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,800
There it is, Kevin.

457
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,520
The whole team.

458
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,760
Welcome to Milton, Chadwick and Waters.

459
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,760
So what do you think?
You can change the furniture if you Like.

460
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,480
I guess it'll do.

461
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,360
Until something better comes along?

462
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,280
Kevin Lomax, Pam Garrety.

463
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,440
Nice to meet you.

464
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,920
Pam was at the Brooklyn D. A. 's office for 14 years...

465
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,800
so she knows her way around the local scene.

466
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,120
You'll expedite his bar application?

467
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,400
It's in the pipeline.
For now, you'll work pro hac vice.

468
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,000
I petitioned Florida for a Letter of good conduct.

469
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:05,080
And I prepared, at Mr. Milton's request,
an overview of the Moyez case.

470
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,520
The Moyez case?

471
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,800
Move, move, move!

472
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,640
What do you think?

473
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,320
It's a health code case and it's a Loser.

474
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,080
So what's the point?

475
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,080
He wants to see if I'll plea-bargain.
It's a test, right?

476
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,560
Isn't everything?

477
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,360
It's an 18th-century Italian silk damask...

478
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,560
with an embossed floriated pattern
of undulating acanthus leaves.

479
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,160
Lovely, isn't it?

480
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,120
And this is about what?

481
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,560
The price?

482
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,800
It's about $2,000 a panel.

483
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,400
We'll take it...

484
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,280
at $1, 400.

485
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,200
You made it.

486
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,360
I thought you said it was impossible.

487
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,720
I thought you said it was important.

488
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,480
Go get them, man.

489
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,880
Tell him, ''Cut that shit down!''

490
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,200
I know what they're doing over there! That's right!

491
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,080
Tell him, ''Take all that noise back to Africa. ''

492
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,880
Good afternoon.
I'm Looking for Phillipe Moyez.

493
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,160
Look, I'm not sure I'm making myself clear.

494
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,240
Moyez, you need him? To speak with him?

495
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,520
Show him your boots.

496
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,680
You're saying he's down here in the basement?

497
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,400
In the dark?

498
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,640
Where do you think I'm taking you?

499
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,040
I thought I would recognize you...

500
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,400
but I do not.

501
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,120
Mr. Moyez?

502
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,880
We've never met.

503
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,040
I'm Kevin Lomax. I'm a Lawyer.

504
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,040
I'm here about the animals.

505
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,560
We have an investment in blood.

506
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,840
Think of it as spiritual currency.

507
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,400
''Spiritual currency. ''

508
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,920
Look, Mr. Moyez, I'm going to need your help with this.

509
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,080
What is the name of the man...

510
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,920
who will prosecute us?

511
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,000
Merto.

512
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,200
Assistant District Attorney Arnold Merto.

513
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,600
What are you doing, Mr. Moyez?

514
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,000
With this tongue, we create silence.

515
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,760
You can go now.

516
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,000
You will have all the help...

517
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,680
I can give you...

518
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,360
against Monsieur Merto.

519
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,560
It's arbor green. What do you think?

520
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,400
Not with your complexion.

521
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,920
New York City health codes.

522
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,680
That's all of it?

523
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,960
Not quite.

524
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,240
Thanks.

525
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,000
Caribbean green.

526
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,960
Something cooler, maybe. Cooler.

527
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,440
A cooler green.

528
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,080
Too institutional.

529
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,960
I Love green.

530
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:30,440
I Love it but it's one thing to wear it and
another to have it on your walls.

531
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,160
I'm just trying to help. It's your walls.
Do what you want.

532
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:43,200
Remember, it's only a health-code case.

533
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,960
This is the first time since I was 13, I don't have a job...

534
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,200
or two.

535
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,120
I feel Like I'm floating around in that place.

536
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,880
You know, just drifting around or something.

537
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,480
You'll settle in.

538
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,760
We had this little office in the condo...

539
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,040
Thanks.

540
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,560
You know, his side and my side. Real nice.

541
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,720
At night, I'd go to sleep, I'd see that Light on...

542
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,480
If I want to see Leamon...

543
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,720
I make an appointment.

544
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,800
You're kidding, right?

545
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,560
God, how do you handle it?

546
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,040
Take a Look around, honey.

547
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,840
Look, you've got three choices.

548
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,680
The Holy Trinity:

549
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,000
You can work...

550
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,720
you can play...

551
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,480
or you can breed.

552
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,840
That's a veaI roast, Your Honor.

553
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,520
USDA approved and stamped.

554
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,840
Men kill animals and eat their flesh.

555
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,520
Phillipe Moyez killed a goat.

556
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,120
He killed a goat.

557
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,120
And he did it at home...

558
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,920
in a manner consistent with his religious beliefs.

559
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,280
Now, Mr. Merto may find that bizarre.

560
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,680
It's certainly not a religious practice
performed by everyone.

561
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,440
It's not as common as, say...

562
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,000
circumcision.

563
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,720
It's not as common as the belief that...

564
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,320
wine transforms into blood.

565
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,720
Some people handle poisonous snakes to prove their faith.

566
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,400
Some people walk on fire.

567
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,880
Phillipe Moyez killed a goat.

568
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,320
And he did it...

569
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,480
while observing his constitutionally protected...

570
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,640
religious beliefs.

571
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,440
Your Honor, this case is not about keeping goats...

572
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,480
or transporting goats or goat licensing.

573
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,360
The city was less concerned with
the care of the animals...

574
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,840
than the manner in which they were slaughtered.

575
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,400
Objection!

576
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,400
Enough, enough. I got it.

577
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,720
Let's wrap it up.

578
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,400
Your Honor...

579
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,280
the city timed this police action to catch my client...

580
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:35,520
exercising his constitutionally protected
right to religious freedom.

581
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,480
This is a law protecting kosher butchering.

582
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,080
Exactly, Your Honor.

583
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:43,640
I'd Like to move at this time for a verdict of dismissal.

584
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,160
I happen to know a little bit about kashrut law, Mr. Lomax.

585
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,400
I'm aware of that, Your Honor.

586
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,600
That's why I feel confident in requesting a dismissal.

587
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,400
Mr. Merto?

588
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,560
For God's sake, man...

589
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,440
Congratulations. Great job.

590
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,520
Bravo! Bravo!

591
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,120
Pamela, you Look Lovely.

592
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,920
So, Phillipe...

593
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,200
satisfied?

594
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,880
AIways, Jean.

595
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,800
What can I say?

596
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,080
Outstanding.

597
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,040
Go figure it, a guy like Moyez...

598
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,920
living in some subterranean shithole...

599
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,720
all the while he's walking around
with $15 million in the bank.

600
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,320
You're kidding.

601
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,160
What do you think he's paying us in?
Goat's blood?

602
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,040
Tarzan, we're billing you out at $400 an hour, my friend.

603
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,760
I don't see a whole lot of pro-bono work
in your immediate future.

604
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:57,000
I figured you came down to make
sure I didn't fuck this up.

605
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,440
Maybe I did.

606
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,480
Don't get too cocky, my boy.
No matter how good you are...

607
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,520
don't Let them see you coming.
That's the gaffe, my friend.

608
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,760
You've gotta keep yourself small.

609
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,040
Innocuous.

610
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,760
Be the little guy.

611
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,920
You know, the nerd, the leper...

612
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,760
the shitkicking surfer. Look at me.

613
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,360
Underestimated from day one.

614
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,720
You'd never think I was a master
of the universe, would you?

615
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,720
That's your only weakness, as far as I can see.

616
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,040
What's that?

617
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,760
It's the Look.

618
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,640
That Florida stud thing.

619
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,920
What is that?

620
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:38,680
Excuse me, ma'am.
Did I leave my boots under your bed?

621
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,120
Never worked a jury that didn't have a woman.

622
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,120
You know what you're missing?

623
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,080
You're missing what I have.

624
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,880
There's this beautiful girl, just fucked
me 40 ways from Sunday...

625
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,760
we're done, she's walking to the bathroom, trying to walk...

626
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,240
she turns...

627
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,200
she Looks...

628
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,880
it's me.

629
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,920
Not the Trojan army that just fucked her. Little old me.

630
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,840
She gets this Look on her face Like:

631
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,920
''How the hell did that happen?''

632
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,680
I'm the hand up Mona Lisa's skirt.

633
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,240
I'm a surprise, Kevin.

634
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,720
They don't see me coming.

635
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,680
That's what you're missing.

636
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,320
Where's the chicken?

637
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:39,000
There's a chicken, plays tic-tac-toe,
never Loses. He's famous.

638
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,040
Never Loses, Like you.

639
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,600
Come on. I'll show you the fastest way uptown.

640
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,880
Learn the subways, Kevin.

641
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,120
Use them.

642
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,200
Stay in the trenches.

643
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,640
Only way I travel.

644
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,960
What happened to the green?

645
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,320
I Loved the green!

646
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,480
Honey, you're late!

647
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,400
We're due up at the Barzoon's palace in 15 minutes.

648
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,240
What's all this?

649
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,480
All what?

650
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,400
Jackie says the ''who's who'' of New York
is gonna be there tonight.

651
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,000
- All this?
- Oh, that.

652
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,720
It was going to be a nursery...

653
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,280
then I remembered you'd have to be
home long enough to knock me up.

654
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,200
So now I'm thinking of building a law library.

655
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,160
Oh, baby.

656
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,400
Tell me I can handle this.

657
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,080
You can handle this.

658
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,560
- Say something nice.
- Something nice.

659
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:48,680
Promise me you won't leave me alone in there.

660
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,720
I promise.

661
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,480
There you are.

662
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,240
Diana Barzoon. Eddie's wife.

663
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,880
Nice to meet you.

664
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:08,240
Kevin Lomax, Health Code Warrior.

665
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,560
All hall.

666
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:12,880
- Mr. Barzoon, this is Mary Ann.
- Nice to meet you.

667
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,400
Well, Kevin, here they are.

668
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,400
Top of the food chain and dinner is served.

669
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,160
I throw these parties twice a year.

670
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:25,960
Stock market, real estate, politics. They're
all players, and they're all prospects.

671
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,160
Congratulations.

672
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,160
Remember Rashid? Just in from Beirut.

673
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,520
Congratulations.

674
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,720
Bright young Lights.

675
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,120
You're going to Like this. Come on.

676
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,720
Somebody I want you to meet.

677
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:43,240
Kevin and Mary Ann Lomax, this
is Senator Alfonse D'Amato.

678
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,200
Ambassador Charles Gagano.

679
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,520
In case you didn't know, these are
the Republicans of New York.

680
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,960
Barzoon always overstates things.

681
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:55,280
Donald Trump was supposed to be here,
but he had a business emergency.

682
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:59,000
I knew I'd find you here.
I'd Like you to meet my wife.

683
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,480
Mary Ann, this is Pam Garrety.

684
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,360
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

685
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,880
- We're partners in crime.
- Someone you must meet.

686
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,880
Excuse me. This is important.

687
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,720
- You are so beautifuI.
- Oh, thank you.

688
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,880
- I heard you met the senator.
- Yes, I did.

689
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,400
- I was married to him.
- Really?

690
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,640
Kidding.

691
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,440
I'd Like you to meet Kevin Lomax.
Kevin is from Florida.

692
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,320
He's new to the firm.

693
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,840
The senator cannot leave.

694
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,560
Who's that with the senator?

695
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,200
- Oh, God, girl.
- You haven't met him yet?

696
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,520
No, who is he?

697
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,160
I swear he can hear us.

698
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,280
Hell, he can smell us.

699
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,280
Mary Ann...

700
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,080
John Milton.

701
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:46,360
I was hoping I'd see you here tonight.
And here you are.

702
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,640
Already swimming with the sharks.

703
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,400
Careful, hon.

704
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:55,520
Come on, if you keep thinking small,
we'll never make any money on you.

705
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,400
These parties don't come cheap.

706
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:00,280
Call him. Talk to him.
See what they have to say.

707
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,520
Just get it on tape.

708
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,520
It's a wonderful opportunity for Kevin.

709
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,960
Yes, Kevin. He's going to do all right if he...

710
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,000
buys a few new suits...

711
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:16,840
learns a few new tricks, he's there.

712
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,160
It's you. What about you?

713
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,840
Your family, you've got to miss them. No?

714
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:28,360
I told Kevin the only thing worse than not
having a father was having mine.

715
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:30,840
I can relate.

716
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,360
I can, believe me.

717
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,000
The worst vice is advice.

718
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,200
But may I make a suggestion?

719
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,400
It's a sensitive...

720
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,680
It's about your hair, that's why I ask.

721
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,360
No, go ahead.

722
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,920
I mean, you don't Like it?

723
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,160
I Like it fine. It's beautifuI.

724
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,200
It's just...

725
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,240
It doesn't belong to you.

726
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,000
You're too alive for a perm.

727
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,760
It's not you.

728
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,720
You should pull your hair back.

729
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,080
Do it. See what happens.

730
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,840
Right now, here, you want me to pull my hair back?

731
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,440
Is that so terrible?

732
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,200
I'd Love to do it, but if I did...

733
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:33,160
everyone in this room who's pretending not to be watching us...

734
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:36,760
would naturally assume that we were fucking or something.

735
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,400
Please.

736
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,440
Okay.

737
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,640
It's fun to be right.

738
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,040
Excuse me.

739
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,800
That's a vision.

740
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,160
You've gotta cut your hair.

741
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,360
Are you serious?

742
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:20,560
A woman's shoulders are the frontlines of her mystique.

743
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:23,920
And her neck...

744
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,360
if she's alive...

745
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,760
has all the mystery of a border town.

746
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,040
A no man's land...

747
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,000
in that battle...

748
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,680
between the mind and the body.

749
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:45,760
You know...

750
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,200
your natural color would really...

751
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,120
bring out your eyes.

752
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,800
Do you have this view?

753
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:09,880
Sorry?

754
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,000
From your terrace, is this your view?

755
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,200
Not exactly.

756
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,800
No terrace and I'm about...

757
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,880
twelve floors down.

758
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,920
What about you?

759
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,560
No, I Live downtown.

760
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,040
This is a...

761
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:28,840
family building.

762
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,480
Sounds Like fun.

763
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,040
Downtown, I mean.

764
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,000
I'm just getting to know the city.

765
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,560
Is it everything you expected?

766
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:42,240
More.

767
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,840
I say we ride them as far as we can, and then eat them.

768
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Excuse me, Jackie.
Have you guys seen Kevin anywhere?

769
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,040
No, I'm sure he's around.

770
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,480
Are you alone?

771
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,240
You mean, tonight?

772
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,040
Is your wife a jealous woman?

773
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:15,280
Oh, dear, I'm going to scare you away.

774
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,720
No, really...

775
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,000
I'm fine.

776
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:20,920
I'm fine.

777
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,560
Bet you Like to be on top.

778
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,920
- Don't you?
- Excuse me?

779
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,280
Of the situation.

780
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,200
You prefer to be on top, right?

781
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,520
Depends on the view.

782
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,200
You know what I see?

783
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,680
I see the future...

784
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,000
of this law firm.

785
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,760
We need to talk, Kevin.
Something's come up.

786
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:07,600
But first I want you to find Heath and Eddie Barzoon.

787
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,600
Bring them up to my place. Do it quietly.

788
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:12,800
Quickly.

789
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:17,600
No problem. Arnold has a few reporters in his pocket.

790
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,960
We'll plant a story and destroy his credibility.

791
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,480
Have you seen Kevin?

792
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,560
- No, I haven't, sweetie.
- Okay.

793
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:27,440
If he doesn't come to us, he'll regret it.

794
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,120
Come on.

795
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,800
Is there more to it?

796
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,280
Just this room.

797
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:08,400
And a bedroom?

798
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,400
No bedroom.

799
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,120
- Where does he sleep?
- Who says he sleeps?

800
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,480
Where does he fuck?

801
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:16,720
Everywhere!

802
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,920
What's up, John?

803
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:24,320
How many hours did we bill
Alex Cullen for last year?

804
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,840
16, 242.

805
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,440
What did he do now?

806
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:34,800
Alex Cullen has just been charged
with murdering his wife...

807
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,040
her stepson...

808
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,560
and a maid.

809
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:42,640
When did this happen?

810
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,240
Just now. Tonight.

811
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,480
I've sent Pam downtown to make ball arrangements.

812
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,000
They're gonna fucking crucify him.

813
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:53,120
They're gonna Iine up! I gotta call Melsel.

814
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,880
I want Kevin on this case.

815
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,520
I hope you're kidding.

816
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:08,040
Alexander Cullen in a Manhattan triple
murder with, excuse me, Kevin?

817
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,280
You're dreaming!

818
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,120
You know, I've shaken hands...

819
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,640
with every marquee defense attorney in this town.

820
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,440
I'd take Kevin and I don't Look back.

821
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:25,280
John, you've got a great eye for talent.

822
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:29,760
You're the master, but you know,
I just don't see this happening.

823
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,240
I want you on board, Eddie.

824
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:38,480
I appreciate the vote of confidence,
but maybe Eddie has a point here.

825
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:41,520
We can get this case.
The man's our client.

826
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,120
He's a business client.

827
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,840
We know him better than he knows himself.

828
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,960
We've got the inside track.

829
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:53,280
We've got the best damn trial Lawyer
in the city. It's ours to Lose.

830
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,800
Tell that to Cullen.

831
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,360
I want Kevin to tell him.

832
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,600
There's Pam.

833
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,960
You gonna fight for this thing or not?

834
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:16,960
Pam?

835
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,760
No, it's Kevin.

836
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,640
No, it's okay. I'm on it. Yeah, I'm on it.

837
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:25,480
Where are we at?

838
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,320
You left me there.

839
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:40,120
I had a fucking panic attack until
Jackie told me where you were.

840
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,080
Three hours! You don't even call!

841
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,120
Stop.

842
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:45,680
Reset.

843
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,680
I'm upstairs with Milton, Heath and Barzoon.

844
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:54,080
There's a good possibility I'm about to catch
a triple homicide defendant...

845
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,600
who also happens to be...

846
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,960
one of the largest real-estate developers in this city.

847
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,200
I had to ball on the party.

848
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,280
You balled on me.

849
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:10,000
- Did you hear me?
- I was all by myself!

850
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,760
For three whole hours.

851
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:14,800
The next time you make a promise, try and keep it!

852
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,640
You gotta be kidding me, right?

853
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:20,080
Go to hell. And you can go to sleep on the fucking couch!

854
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,720
- You sure he's up there?
- Yeah, CNN passed the word.

855
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,560
Look at this.

856
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:32,120
I'm not out 20 minutes, and I'm being followed by the press.

857
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:33,680
They're Like insects.

858
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,240
Alex, just calm down and Listen, okay?

859
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:42,760
I don't know. Maybe you're right.
Maybe he is a whiz kid, but Jesus Christ!

860
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,520
This is my ass we're talking about!

861
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:49,680
Alex, you know how this town works.

862
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,960
You've got enemies here you haven't heard from.

863
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:58,000
Now, with this...

864
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,320
now that you're down...

865
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,280
I'd get ready for one of those...

866
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,920
Class-A, New York-style pigfucks.

867
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,000
You know what's coming.

868
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:10,880
Now you're going to have to ask yourself,
''who do you trust?''

869
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,080
I don't know.

870
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,160
I'm gonna have to Look around.

871
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,080
You don't have time to shop, Mr. Cullen.

872
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:24,880
Jury selection started today at every
breakfast table in the city.

873
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,880
This is what people know:

874
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,920
Three dead bodies.

875
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,120
You discover the crime.

876
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:35,240
You call it in. You've got blood
on your person and clothes.

877
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,200
And Mr. Cullen...

878
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:41,480
Your prints are on the murder weapon.

879
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:43,160
How do you know that?

880
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,320
There's a second print in blood.

881
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:50,040
It's a partial of a hand on the wall next to the bodies.

882
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:54,240
I have keys. I called the cops from the house!
I touched the goddamn wall!

883
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:55,800
I panicked! I was panicked!

884
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:58,040
We need 12 people who can see past all that.

885
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:01,280
- I touched the goddamn wall!
- I'd get in front of this fast.

886
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,640
I panicked! Is that a crime?

887
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,360
I didn't kill anybody.

888
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,640
This is a nightmare.

889
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:13,280
How am I going to convince anybody?
I'm innocent.

890
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,600
He's right, Alex.

891
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,040
People need to hear these things.

892
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,640
Christ, Eddie.

893
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:24,040
You're not happy tomorrow?
The next day?

894
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,240
We'll move over.

895
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,680
But right now, this moment...

896
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,520
you need immediate representation.

897
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,640
I have a 14-year-old stepdaughter...

898
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:36,360
who I care more about than anything in this world.

899
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,160
They wouldn't Let me talk to her from downtown.

900
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,680
They won't Let me talk to her now that I'm out!

901
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,440
We need to issue a statement.

902
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,080
He's a winner, Alex.

903
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:50,160
Just Like you were.

904
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,560
And they'll never see him coming.

905
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,680
Jesus Christ.

906
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,960
I've got some tough phone calls I've got to...

907
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,240
My place, tomorrow.

908
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:13,640
Alone.

909
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:21,720
You better be every fucking inch
as good as he says you are.

910
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,280
Not if they were giving it away.

911
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:36,200
Come on, Mary Ann.
Let's check out Yoshi's.

912
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,640
- Andrea?
- Yes?

913
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,200
Another one of these, please.

914
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:41,480
Right away.

915
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:43,920
- No, no, no!
- Yes, yes, yes...

916
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,400
I want you loose and pliable this afternoon.

917
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,640
Oh, Lord, this is $3,000.

918
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,360
You know what you should do?

919
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,000
You should buy it...

920
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:00,240
wear it once, and then throw it away.

921
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,320
That will loosen you up.

922
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,720
I say spend it all.

923
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:10,440
If you never see your husband,
have a relationship with his money.

924
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:11,840
I swear...

925
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,360
if Eddie wasn't afraid of me shouting my mouth off...

926
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:19,280
he would've put a cellulite clause in the pre-nup.

927
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:21,480
Dr. Robert, I'm telling you...

928
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:24,360
he's a miracle man.
You've seen my new tits.

929
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:26,360
Who does it better than that?

930
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,680
It's not my tits I'm worried about.

931
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,720
Not too big...

932
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,040
Perfect.

933
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:37,440
Real or not?

934
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,320
They Look real.

935
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:43,800
They must be real.

936
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:46,840
Feel them.

937
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:48,320
No, it's okay, really.

938
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:51,360
Go ahead. That's the ultimate test. Come on.

939
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:55,880
Feel real?

940
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:57,720
Yes, absolutely real.

941
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,240
Dr. Robert.

942
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:05,160
When you're ready.

943
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:30,920
So, what do you think?

944
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:37,720
I don't care if they can hear me.
I don't care!

945
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:41,120
I don't Like it here, Kevin.

946
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,640
And these women! My God, I mean,
I'm seeing things for Christ's sake!

947
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,040
- You just left them in the store?
- Yes!

948
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,560
- Calm down!
- No!

949
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:49,960
Listen to me!

950
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:53,280
First...

951
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:57,480
You do this radical thing to your hair.

952
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,000
You hate it.

953
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,600
Stop. It's fine.

954
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:04,600
I think it's fine.
But I also think it's traumatic.

955
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:09,480
You've got the pressure of fitting in with new friends.

956
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,400
A new place.

957
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:14,520
Add to that a couple bottles of wine.

958
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,640
No. It wasn't the wine, Kevin.

959
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:21,440
It wasn't the wine, or my hair, or talking to Kathy...

960
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:22,920
or anything Like that!

961
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:25,640
Because I know that's what you're gonna say.

962
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:27,360
What about Kathy?

963
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,240
What about your sister?

964
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:31,880
What about her? She's pregnant again.

965
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:35,000
That's got nothing to do with this?

966
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,840
Kevin, I never see you anymore.

967
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:45,760
And now that you've got this big case,
it's just only gonna get worse.

968
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,600
If you can believe it...

969
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:51,600
I'm actually Looking forward to having
your mother come and visit.

970
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,120
What about the apartment?

971
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:54,800
Goddamn you!

972
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,040
Why do you always have to change things around?

973
00:59:57,120 --> 01:00:00,840
This is not about the apartment!
I hate this stupid place!

974
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:03,960
You know...

975
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:07,120
you buy a couple new suits and you're fine.

976
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:08,720
It's a little more than that.

977
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:11,160
I have this whole fucking place to fill!

978
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:15,280
I know we have all this money and it's
supposed to be fun, but it's not!

979
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:19,720
It's Like a test.
The whole thing is Like one big test.

980
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:21,880
And God... !

981
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:33,040
I am so lonely!

982
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,600
I miss you so much.

983
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:38,880
I'm sorry, baby.

984
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:42,040
I don't know what to do.

985
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,120
Let's make a baby.

986
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,360
Don't tease me.

987
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:54,000
I wouldn't do that.

988
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:56,360
Not unless you asked.

989
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,160
Oh, baby.

990
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:27,840
Do you have this view?

991
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:03,680
Make Love to me.

992
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:49,440
What are you doing?

993
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:20,600
Stop.

994
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:23,160
Oh, God.

995
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:25,400
God!

996
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:26,840
Where are you?

997
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:29,000
I'm right here.

998
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:32,480
No, you're not.

999
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:43,560
- Why do we have to keep going?
- Because it needs to be clear.

1000
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:47,560
Because I need to know and understand exactly...

1001
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,160
what happened.

1002
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,760
You're standing there, you Look down...

1003
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:54,920
there's the gun.

1004
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:57,920
I don't know why I picked it up.

1005
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:00,920
It was before I saw Elucinda's body.

1006
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,840
You kneeled down to pick it up?

1007
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:08,760
You work late, you come home,
you walk in, everybody's dead!

1008
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:10,440
It's not something you plan for!

1009
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:12,520
Stop. Back up.

1010
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:16,040
Two prints by the gun.

1011
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:18,800
''Right hand. ''

1012
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:21,120
''Right knee. ''

1013
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:23,760
Right knee.

1014
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:25,800
We've been over this.

1015
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:27,600
I'm trying to picture it.

1016
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:28,880
Your hand...

1017
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,880
your hand came from...

1018
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:35,000
inside and underneath?

1019
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:40,560
Do you want to see it? Here.
I'll fucking show you.

1020
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,960
See? Did you see it? Was it clear?

1021
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:54,560
You got it?

1022
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:56,120
Whose gun is that?

1023
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:58,880
- It's mine!
- Are you out of your mind?

1024
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:02,480
You're charged with a triple homicide,
you're walking around with a gun!

1025
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:04,920
I have had nine death threats!

1026
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,080
Give it over. Give me the gun.

1027
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:09,240
I gotta protect myself.

1028
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:13,600
That's my job. When the case is over, you can have it back.

1029
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:18,720
This is a deal breaker, Alex.

1030
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:33,360
Let's wrap it up.

1031
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:34,800
So, what's next?

1032
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:38,440
We need to talk to your assistant, Mrs. BIack.

1033
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:39,640
Call her.

1034
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,720
You feel confident she'll back you on the time?

1035
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:46,320
Melissa, yeah, yeah.

1036
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:49,120
She's okay. She's a straight arrow.

1037
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:53,600
We're going to talk to her...

1038
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:57,880
and you're not going to talk to anybody, all right?

1039
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:00,200
All right?

1040
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:04,840
No comment.

1041
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:09,480
There they are!

1042
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:13,680
Kevin, how about a couple shots?

1043
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:16,680
How does it feel to get the biggest murder trial in New York?

1044
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:20,320
Look over here! Are you really going
to plead Cullen not guilty?

1045
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:21,800
What is happening?

1046
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:24,960
Since the case, Kevin's picture's been in the paper.

1047
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:28,360
He always did Like to stick his nose in the camera.

1048
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:31,480
- Sorry about that.
- No problem.

1049
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:33,520
Did you have a nice dinner?

1050
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:35,960
Oh, I surely did. Are you hungry?

1051
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:37,800
Oh, no, ma'am. Thank you.

1052
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,280
Welcome to Babylon, Ma.

1053
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:41,880
Speak of the devil.

1054
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,720
I was just telling them the Moyez story.

1055
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:48,600
Really?

1056
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:50,920
This is your mother.

1057
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,600
Yes, Mom, this is...

1058
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:53,960
John Milton.

1059
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:56,800
Alice Lomax.

1060
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:59,440
It's a pieasure to meet you.

1061
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:01,720
How do you do?

1062
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:06,480
- You're Looking Loveiy.
- Thanks.

1063
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:11,320
I believe you met Christabella.

1064
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:12,920
Yes, I think we did.

1065
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:14,560
And Gizelle.

1066
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:16,760
Fresh in from Paris.

1067
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:18,720
Great.

1068
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:20,960
Nice to meet you.

1069
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:24,760
Three for you...

1070
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:26,320
and my place.

1071
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:27,680
Thanks for the champagne.

1072
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:29,920
You're very welcome, Kevin.

1073
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:35,720
This isn't really your first visit to
New York, now, is it, Mrs. Lomax?

1074
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:40,160
Yes.

1075
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:51,360
You've done one hell of a job bringing him up, Mrs. Lomax.

1076
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:53,360
I'm sure...

1077
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:55,120
it wasn't easy.

1078
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:58,960
No.

1079
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:03,680
Mom, we're here.

1080
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,520
Good night to you.

1081
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:08,760
Good night, Mary Ann.

1082
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:10,800
Kevin, hang on.

1083
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:14,600
How about Cullen? How's it going?

1084
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:16,120
Everything on beam?

1085
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:18,280
That's a long conversation.

1086
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,880
Want to come up and tell me?

1087
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:22,320
Now?

1088
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:31,600
Let's talk tomorrow.

1089
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:35,520
You sure?

1090
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:48,400
Is that what you're doing when you're working late?

1091
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:50,040
What're you talking about?

1092
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:52,440
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

1093
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:54,600
- That's ridiculous.
- Yeah, right.

1094
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:56,080
I'm going to bed.

1095
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:58,080
- Good night, Alice.
- 'Night.

1096
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:13,520
Oh, shit!

1097
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:19,080
Mom, what are you doing?

1098
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:20,680
I'm going home.

1099
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:22,560
What are you talking about?

1100
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:24,840
I don't feel right.

1101
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,320
Look, you just got here.

1102
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:32,000
And I just got my teeth kicked in on
the front page, so I gotta run.

1103
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,760
We'll talk later, okay?

1104
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,920
I have to go, Kevin.

1105
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:43,920
I miss my church.

1106
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:48,400
This is New York. There must be 20,000
churches. Take your pick.

1107
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,720
You need to do a better job with Mary Ann.

1108
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:53,440
She is not well.

1109
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:56,360
- This place is not good for her.
- So stay.

1110
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:58,800
Take care of her, if you're so concerned.

1111
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:00,240
Help me out.

1112
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:02,840
I'll take her home if you Let me.

1113
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:05,520
This is home. Understand?

1114
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:07,040
This is where we Live.

1115
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,280
I'm not going back to Gainesville.

1116
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:11,040
Unbelievable.

1117
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:13,160
''Wide is the gate...

1118
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:16,320
and broad is the way that leadeth to temptation. ''

1119
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:18,200
It's a little early for Scripture.

1120
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:21,120
I'm going to work.
You can do whatever you want.

1121
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:46,840
Does my babysitter have to testify?

1122
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:50,080
We need her to establish the time you returned home.

1123
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:53,240
She doesn't have a green card, is why I ask.

1124
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:55,960
I would hate for her to get in trouble.

1125
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:57,120
Tell you what, Melissa...

1126
01:10:57,200 --> 01:11:00,760
Let's talk to her first. See where she
stands and take it from there.

1127
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:03,520
I'll make sure Melissa gets down to the car.

1128
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:05,920
Mr. Cullen didn't kill those people.

1129
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:09,200
I know him. He's a difficult man,
but he couldn't kill anyone.

1130
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:11,560
That's why we're all working so hard.

1131
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:13,600
Thank you.

1132
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,680
Can I have the car stop at my ex-husband's?

1133
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:20,360
- My son left his jacket there.
- Sure.

1134
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:29,360
Remember, no shredding in the building
trash, only in the private refuse.

1135
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:32,640
Excelsior Securities, who's handling that?

1136
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:34,960
- I am.
- All this has got to go.

1137
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:37,480
GuatemaIa, Sudan, Cyprus...

1138
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:43,120
Vagada Holdings, it'll take you all night.
Just Vagada Holdings.

1139
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:47,720
I thought I was the only one working late.

1140
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:51,960
So did we.

1141
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:55,720
Back to work. This is not a break.

1142
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:57,000
Good news.

1143
01:11:57,080 --> 01:12:00,160
We just wrapped up with Cullen's assistant.
Looks Like a great alibi.

1144
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:01,960
What a pleasant surprise.

1145
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,920
Looks Like you've got your hands full.

1146
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,160
It's just a little...

1147
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:10,760
housekeeping.

1148
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:13,240
If anyone should ask...

1149
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:15,840
you never saw this.

1150
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:17,520
Who would ask?

1151
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:19,760
Weaver.

1152
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:21,040
Who's that?

1153
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:24,680
Justice Department. Weaver Commission.

1154
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:28,440
You don't know about him?

1155
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:29,600
Sorry.

1156
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:32,440
How nice for you.

1157
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:37,320
Grab your coat. The night is young.
We're going to the Garden. Ringside.

1158
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:38,680
Title fight.

1159
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:40,360
Roy Jones, Jr.

1160
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:42,240
I have to call Mary Ann.

1161
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:43,680
Do it on the way.

1162
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:47,040
Get my message?

1163
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,720
I did. You write beautifully.

1164
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,720
What's this Weaver Commission?

1165
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:58,000
I don't Like to micro-manage.

1166
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:00,200
Find the talent, then delegate.

1167
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:03,160
Who the hell knows what Eddie's up to?

1168
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:06,400
He's got a lot of fingers in a lot of pies.

1169
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:08,560
Excuse me.

1170
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:10,880
What the fuck are you Looking at?

1171
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:13,880
You. You deaf or something?
You don't hear me?

1172
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:15,640
I hear you fine.

1173
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,560
So get the fuck out of my car.

1174
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:21,840
Why? I didn't know it was your car.
I'm having a good time here.

1175
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:23,600
I'm telling you, motherfucker...

1176
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:24,920
get the fuck out of my car...

1177
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:25,880
Shit.

1178
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,440
Get out before I cut your throat.

1179
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:29,720
Fuck that.

1180
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,360
How do you know?

1181
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:02,680
Enjoy yourself.

1182
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:04,320
You still got time.

1183
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:07,920
There's a train coming the other way.
You'll just catch it.

1184
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
You'll thank me in the morning.

1185
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:11,400
If you ain't right...

1186
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:12,680
I'm right.

1187
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:13,960
You'll see.

1188
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:17,000
Invigorating.

1189
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:19,680
What did you say to him?

1190
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:24,800
I told him if he didn't leave us alone, you'd kick his ass.

1191
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:28,120
Look, there's a lady getting up from her seat. Come on.

1192
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:32,480
Give it to him! You want this round?
You are on!

1193
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:36,320
Roy's gonna get him. Now, now, now!

1194
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:47,880
Fixed!

1195
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:56,320
- What a beauty!
- I'm glad you could come!

1196
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:00,640
I want you to meet my new heavyweight, here:
Kevin Lomax.

1197
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,160
How are you?

1198
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:03,360
I'm well.

1199
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:24,040
And say what?

1200
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:26,240
He's the senior partner at the...

1201
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:31,080
You're really starting to piss me off.

1202
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:42,360
Yes, I'm having one cigarette.

1203
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:46,040
You want me to lie?
One cigarette after seven months is not...

1204
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:48,240
That's exactly what I'm saying!

1205
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:51,880
Go to bed. I have no idea.

1206
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:05,400
Stop. This guy pays our bills.

1207
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:09,360
The food, the heat, the rent on that
enormous apartment we Live in.

1208
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,120
I Live there, too.

1209
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:18,760
Give it back to me!

1210
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:26,560
Babs Coleman.

1211
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:28,480
Kevin Lomax.

1212
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:31,560
Babs is from Georgia Tech.
It's your neck of the woods.

1213
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:32,680
There's Tiffany.

1214
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:35,360
New additions. Where are you from?

1215
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:37,120
Don't tell me!

1216
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:39,320
Michigan!

1217
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:42,640
How'd you know? Oh, my goodness.

1218
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,280
How did he know?

1219
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:46,000
That is so good.

1220
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:02,440
Cheers.

1221
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:56,440
Hello?

1222
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:58,880
Who is there?

1223
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:01,360
I got a knife.

1224
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:25,800
Oh, Jesus.

1225
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:34,120
Baby...

1226
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:36,600
how'd you get here?

1227
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:40,040
Are you okay?

1228
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:43,720
Oh, God.

1229
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:48,720
Where's your mommy?

1230
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:53,320
You ain't got no mommy?
What do you got there?

1231
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:55,800
What are you playing with?

1232
01:18:57,120 --> 01:18:59,040
What are you playing with?

1233
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:07,000
Oh, God!

1234
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:18,080
Baby, please.

1235
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:20,520
Baby, there is no blood.

1236
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:23,440
There is no blood. It was a dream.

1237
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:24,920
It was a dream.

1238
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:28,680
It's not a dream if it's true.

1239
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:34,720
Look, Let's get you undressed and in the tub, okay?

1240
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:36,040
No!

1241
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:38,040
I know you.

1242
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:41,880
You'll leave me now for sure.

1243
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:44,880
No! Get away from me!

1244
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:50,560
I'm confused.

1245
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,040
Why?

1246
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:54,360
What is it now?

1247
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:58,320
Did you Like the green?

1248
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,560
You did, didn't you?

1249
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:02,120
We should go back to the green.

1250
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:05,040
I'm calling the doctor.
I'm going to get you some help.

1251
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:07,040
They took my ovaries, Kevin.

1252
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:12,640
They took my ovaries!

1253
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,880
I told you! Right here!

1254
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:18,480
Mary Ann, it was a nightmare.
It didn't happen.

1255
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:25,560
My sisters have seven children between them.

1256
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:31,520
My mother had Derek when she was 45.

1257
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:34,360
You could've set a clock by my periods.

1258
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,600
Baby...

1259
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:38,480
what are you talking about?

1260
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:42,560
Kevin, I can't have children.

1261
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,000
What?

1262
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:45,880
Says who?

1263
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:50,840
The doctor.

1264
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:53,600
I was there yesterday.

1265
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:58,000
''Non-specific ovarian failure. ''

1266
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:01,440
That's ridiculous.

1267
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:05,800
Oh, God.

1268
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:09,240
Did you just hear that?

1269
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:11,360
Listen.

1270
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:14,800
Can you hear that?

1271
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:18,880
No.

1272
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:25,320
You're going to leave me, aren't you?

1273
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:30,800
I know you.

1274
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:33,080
God...

1275
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:37,480
No, Kevin.

1276
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:39,400
It's these monsters.

1277
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:42,800
I dreamt about this.

1278
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:45,560
Baby, I gotta take this.

1279
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:48,160
No, you've gotta Listen to me.

1280
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:51,480
I gotta take this.

1281
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:55,080
It's going to be okay.

1282
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:03,360
Fuck!

1283
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:05,920
I knew the D. A. was holding out on us.

1284
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:08,840
Get the discovery package over here, right now.

1285
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:11,840
I don't care. Find Cullen.

1286
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:24,040
I get one supervised hour a week with my stepdaughter.

1287
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:27,520
I am in there with two shrinks and three social workers.

1288
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:30,520
You better have a good reason for calling me out.

1289
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:33,800
Your wife, the day she was killed, had lunch with a friend.

1290
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:37,160
She says, and I quote:
''Alex is fucking around and I can prove it. ''

1291
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:39,200
That's hearsay. That never gets in.

1292
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:40,560
Wrong answer.

1293
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:43,040
Your prenuptial agreement's on file at the firm.

1294
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:45,800
The contract is void in the event of marital infidelity.

1295
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:48,200
You fuck around, she gets rich.

1296
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:50,800
That's a motive, Alex.

1297
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,480
What do I need to know?

1298
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:04,080
Melissa, my assistant.

1299
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:07,240
She wasn't even that good a fuck.

1300
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:08,560
And...

1301
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:11,160
on the night in question?

1302
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:22,320
I was boning my assistant the night my wife got shot.

1303
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:30,000
I've got to re-interview Melissa.

1304
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:33,360
No, forget it. We're not telling that story.

1305
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:36,840
Juries want honesty.
Fuck with that at your peril.

1306
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:41,280
Alessandra, wait!

1307
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:46,040
Not now. Mrs. Skylar, please!

1308
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:47,840
Time's up, Mr. Cullen.

1309
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:49,480
Alex!

1310
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:50,880
I can't!

1311
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:54,520
This isn't fair. I had 15 more minutes.

1312
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:57,520
You'll just have to wait until next week.

1313
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:01,600
- I'll see you next week.
- That's it, I'm sorry.

1314
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:04,760
For sleep.

1315
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:07,160
And she can take that during the day?

1316
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:09,080
No, she won't be driving.

1317
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:12,280
I'll have the pharmacy call you right back.

1318
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:16,760
He's not sure. He thinks it could be
some kind of hormonal imbalance.

1319
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:18,840
I'm taking you off the case.

1320
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:22,200
I want you to drop this case.

1321
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:23,920
This case? Cullen?

1322
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:27,160
- I've got a jury showing up.
- Do you Love this woman?

1323
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:29,520
- Of course I do.
- Then what are you doing?

1324
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:30,920
She's sick.

1325
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:34,240
Everyone will understand. I'll understand.

1326
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:35,880
What about Cullen?

1327
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:37,960
We find somebody new.

1328
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:39,760
You consult.

1329
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:41,840
You Live to fight another day.

1330
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:45,120
What are you talking about?
I put together a great jury.

1331
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:47,680
It's a disappointment. We have them.

1332
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:52,320
All of us have them. You use it.
You embrace it. And then you move on.

1333
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:55,920
Hang on.

1334
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:57,840
We've gotta talk about this.

1335
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:01,280
Listen to yourself, Kevin.
''We've gotta talk about this. ''

1336
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:03,120
It's your wife!

1337
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:05,320
She's sick, she needs you.

1338
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:07,440
She's got to come first.

1339
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:09,360
All right, wait a minute.

1340
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:13,760
Do you mean the possibility of leaving this
case has never entered your mind?

1341
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:20,000
You know what scares me?

1342
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:23,280
I quit the case, she gets better...

1343
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:25,920
and I hate her for it.

1344
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,360
I don't want to resent her.

1345
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:29,920
I've got a winner here.

1346
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:34,120
I've got to nail this fucker down and
put it behind me. Just get it done.

1347
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:35,480
Then...

1348
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:37,080
then...

1349
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:39,520
put all my energy into her.

1350
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:48,000
I stand corrected.

1351
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:51,760
Fill me in. Did Cullen's assistant admit to the affair?

1352
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:54,000
She did to me, but...

1353
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:55,720
she won't in court.

1354
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:57,520
Convince her otherwise.

1355
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:00,480
And when all that evidence is laid before you...

1356
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:04,840
when all these pieces weave together, you will conclude...

1357
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,440
you will know...

1358
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:09,200
that Alexander Cullen is guilty...

1359
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:11,360
of murdering three people...

1360
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:13,200
in cold blood...

1361
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:15,880
and with malice aforethought.

1362
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:17,600
Thank you.

1363
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:20,080
Your Honor.

1364
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:24,800
We can break for lunch now or
you can do a stop and start.

1365
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:27,200
If it's a choice, I'll go now.

1366
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:29,680
I won't be as long as Mr. Broygo.

1367
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:31,040
Proceed.

1368
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:38,400
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

1369
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:42,360
I know you've spent all morning Listening to Mr. Broygo.

1370
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:43,840
I know you're hungry.

1371
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:47,040
What I need to tell you won't take very long at all.

1372
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:51,040
I don't Like Alexander Cullen.

1373
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:54,200
I don't think he's a nice person.

1374
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:56,920
I don't expect you to Like him.

1375
01:26:57,720 --> 01:27:00,880
He's been a terrible husband to all three of his wives.

1376
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:04,160
He's been a destructive force in
the Lives of his stepchildren.

1377
01:27:04,240 --> 01:27:06,400
He's cheated the city, his partners...

1378
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:07,640
his employees.

1379
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:11,440
He's paid hundreds of thousands
of dollars in penalties and fines.

1380
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:13,280
I don't Like him.

1381
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:18,440
I'm going to tell you some things
during the course of this trial...

1382
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:21,400
that are going to make you Like him even less.

1383
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:24,480
But this isn't a popularity contest.

1384
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:26,120
It's a murder trial.

1385
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:31,560
And the single most important provable
fact of this proceeding...

1386
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:36,200
is that Alexander Cullen was somewhere else...

1387
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:37,640
when these...

1388
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:40,320
horrible crimes took place.

1389
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:43,400
Now, the State...

1390
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:46,320
The State is going all out here.

1391
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:48,320
They've got this whole team here...

1392
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:51,080
throwing everything but the kitchen sink at this case.

1393
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:52,880
I want one thing from you.

1394
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:54,480
That's it.

1395
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:56,080
One thing.

1396
01:27:57,400 --> 01:27:59,720
I want you to ask yourself:

1397
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:03,320
''Is not liking this man...

1398
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:07,320
reason enough...

1399
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:09,760
to convict him of murder?''

1400
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:14,080
Enjoy your lunch.

1401
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:15,840
We'll talk again.

1402
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:21,160
What the fuck was that about?
They're going to hate me!

1403
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:24,680
Listen to me Like you've never
to anyone before in your life.

1404
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:27,280
I'm gonna bust my ass to make sure they hate you.

1405
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:31,600
Because as long as you're boning Melissa,
you're not home killing your wife!

1406
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:35,960
Why didn't you say something before?

1407
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:38,880
Then it doesn't Look spontaneous.

1408
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:42,600
You got it now.

1409
01:28:56,640 --> 01:28:57,960
Saw you go in.

1410
01:28:58,040 --> 01:28:59,120
What's up?

1411
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:01,040
Congratulations.

1412
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:04,960
- It's not over yet.
- I'm not talking about the trial.

1413
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:06,400
What are you talking about?

1414
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:09,960
How the fuck does your name get on the firm's charter?

1415
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:12,240
What?

1416
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:14,280
It Looks Like it's been there for years.

1417
01:29:14,360 --> 01:29:17,160
So, now you're a partner.
When did that happen?

1418
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:21,320
You know, I still am the managing director of this firm.

1419
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:23,240
You want my job, take me head on.

1420
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:24,680
You backdoor me one more time...

1421
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:28,200
and I'll take your partnership papers
and shove them down your throat!

1422
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:31,720
I don't know what you're talking about.
I sure don't Like your tone of voice.

1423
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:32,880
Bullshit.

1424
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:34,680
You've got a problem with documents...

1425
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:38,800
I suggest you put together one of your
late-night shredding sessions.

1426
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:45,640
You think you're tough enough to run this firm?

1427
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:49,440
Remember the Weaver Commission investigation?

1428
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:51,280
Tell your mentor...

1429
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:54,600
the next time Weaver calls me, maybe I'll just...

1430
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:56,320
pick up the phone.

1431
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:03,280
- Was he drunk?
- I doubt it.

1432
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:05,000
He was going running.

1433
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:07,600
What the hell was he talking about?

1434
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:11,200
Eddie's got himself in trouble again.

1435
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:15,600
And he wants me to save him.
Only this time, I can't.

1436
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:19,680
Why does he think I'm after his job?

1437
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:22,960
You ever have any experience with manic depression?

1438
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:24,200
Not directly, no.

1439
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:25,480
You do now.

1440
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:26,440
346.

1441
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:28,440
It's me. Get Eddie Barzoon.

1442
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:31,440
He may be out running, so you might have to page him.

1443
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:33,480
- It's an emergency.
- Yes, sir.

1444
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:35,920
You Look Like you could use a drink.

1445
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:38,160
Yes, thanks.

1446
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:41,320
Eddie Barzoon, Eddie Barzoon.

1447
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:47,120
I nursed him through two divorces, a cocaine rehab...

1448
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:49,480
and a pregnant receptionist.

1449
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:52,400
God's creature, right?

1450
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:55,000
God's special creature?

1451
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:58,040
I've warned him, Kevin.

1452
01:30:58,120 --> 01:31:00,520
I've warned him every step of the way.

1453
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:03,240
Watching him bounce around like a fucking game.

1454
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:04,840
Like a wind-up toy.

1455
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:06,440
Like 250 pounds...

1456
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:09,480
of self-serving greed on wheels.

1457
01:31:09,640 --> 01:31:12,520
The next thousand years is right around the corner.

1458
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:14,000
Eddie Barzoon...

1459
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:16,200
take a good look because...

1460
01:31:16,280 --> 01:31:19,160
he's the poster child for the next millennium.

1461
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,080
These people...

1462
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:24,680
it's no mystery where they come from.

1463
01:31:28,280 --> 01:31:30,520
You sharpen the human appetite...

1464
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:34,360
to the point where it can split atoms with its desire.

1465
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:37,280
You build egos the size of cathedrals.

1466
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:41,200
Fiber-optically connect the world to every eager impulse.

1467
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:44,760
Grease even the dullest dreams with these dollar-green...

1468
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:49,560
gold-plated fantasies until every human
becomes an aspiring emperor...

1469
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:52,880
becomes his own god.
Where can you go from there?

1470
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:54,640
Wrong way!

1471
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:56,560
Fuck you...

1472
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:58,320
As we're scrambling...

1473
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:00,160
from one deal to the next...

1474
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:01,880
who's got his eye on the planet?

1475
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,160
As the air thickens, the water sours...

1476
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:07,640
even bees' honey takes on the metallic
taste of radioactivity...

1477
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:11,000
and it just keeps coming, faster and faster.

1478
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:13,520
Help! Stop it!

1479
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:16,240
There's no chance to think, to prepare.

1480
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:18,920
It's buy futures, sell futures...

1481
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:21,000
when there is no future.

1482
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:23,240
We got a runaway train, boy.

1483
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:27,240
We got a billion Eddie Barzoons all jogging into the future.

1484
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:31,160
Every one of them is getting ready
to fistfuck God's ex-planet...

1485
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:32,960
lick their fingers clean...

1486
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:35,280
as they reach out toward their pristine...

1487
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:36,880
cybernetic keyboards...

1488
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:39,600
to tote up their fucking billable hours.

1489
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:41,960
And then it hits home.

1490
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:44,360
You got to pay your own way, Eddie.

1491
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:47,400
It's a little late in the game to buy out now.

1492
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:48,920
Give me your watch.

1493
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:52,520
I Like this watch!
Do you think you're just going to take it?

1494
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:55,240
Your belly's too full...

1495
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:57,280
your dick is sore...

1496
01:32:57,360 --> 01:33:01,120
your eyes are bloodshot and you're
screaming for someone to help.

1497
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:02,480
But guess what?

1498
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:05,000
There's no one there!

1499
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:07,480
You're all alone, Eddie.

1500
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:10,440
You're God's special little creature.

1501
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:18,440
Maybe it's true.

1502
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:21,560
Maybe God threw the dice once too often.

1503
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:24,440
Maybe He Let us all down.

1504
01:33:34,120 --> 01:33:37,000
You testified the defendant called you at 4:30...

1505
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:40,680
to ask you to come to his office
gym for the purposes of sex.

1506
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:41,800
Yes.

1507
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:45,680
Mr. Cullen, though, he's not just your Lover, is he?

1508
01:33:46,040 --> 01:33:47,280
He's the boss.

1509
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:50,440
Yes.

1510
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:53,640
So two hours go by before you act on his request?

1511
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:55,760
Yes, I went up at 6:10.

1512
01:33:55,960 --> 01:33:58,800
It was 6:10 because I heard the weather coming on the news.

1513
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:00,000
Okay, stop.

1514
01:34:01,240 --> 01:34:03,440
This prosecutor is no fool.

1515
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:07,800
He's going to change tempo, attitude, tone of voice.

1516
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:12,240
He's going to come out with questions you
never thought of just to screw you up.

1517
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:13,880
So what do we do?

1518
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:17,960
Yes and no answers. Stay caIm.

1519
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:19,680
Exactly.

1520
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:27,520
Is it your testimony, Mrs. Black, that between
the hours of 6:10 and 9:40...

1521
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:30,600
you were engaged in sexuaI congress with the defendant?

1522
01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:31,480
Yes.

1523
01:34:31,560 --> 01:34:34,520
At any point during this three-hour marathon...

1524
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:36,320
did you Lose sight of the defendant?

1525
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:38,320
- No.
- Did he use the bathroom?

1526
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:41,080
- Yes.
- Is he circumcised?

1527
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:48,600
You understand the question?

1528
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:49,680
Yeah.

1529
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:52,600
So is he cut or not?

1530
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:54,520
Yes.

1531
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:56,800
Which is it?

1532
01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:01,600
You've polished his knob three
times a week for six months.

1533
01:35:01,720 --> 01:35:03,480
You don't know if he has foreskin?

1534
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:05,280
I've had enough of your fucking game!

1535
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:08,840
Why don't you take your questions
and shove them up your ass!

1536
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:28,440
What's happening?

1537
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:30,400
It's Eddie Barzoon.

1538
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:31,640
What about him?

1539
01:35:31,720 --> 01:35:33,920
He's dead. He was killed.

1540
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:35,680
- When?
- Last night.

1541
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:38,280
- In the park.
- He was running, if you can believe it.

1542
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:40,120
What is wrong with people?

1543
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:42,640
At least they got the scumbags who did it.

1544
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:43,720
Who?

1545
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:45,760
Two old homeless crazies.

1546
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:51,520
You're due in court in 30 minutes.

1547
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:54,520
- Get your things together.
- Are we finished in here or what?

1548
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:57,880
I'll bring Melissa down to the car.
You better get going.

1549
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:04,400
I want you to put Eddie aside.
Let me worry about it.

1550
01:36:06,040 --> 01:36:08,080
You've got to deal with Cullen.

1551
01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:12,240
You've got to marshal your strength.
Prioritize. Conserve your energy.

1552
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:14,760
I can't put her on the stand.

1553
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:18,640
- What choice do you have?
- I know she's lying!

1554
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:23,600
She's lying because she didn't answer
you fast enough? She lied to you? No.

1555
01:36:24,440 --> 01:36:26,120
She said nothing.

1556
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:28,680
Fact is, you'll never know anyway.

1557
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:30,640
He killed those people.

1558
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:34,080
You really believe that?

1559
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:36,640
He set me up.

1560
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:40,200
Cullen fucking set me up.
Melissa... the whole thing.

1561
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:41,760
I know it.

1562
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:45,600
Got to go with your gut.

1563
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:47,440
That's your advice?

1564
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:50,760
I'll back you either way.

1565
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:55,760
Maybe it's your time to Lose.

1566
01:36:57,280 --> 01:36:59,200
Think I haven't Lost before?

1567
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:10,440
We talked about this, remember?

1568
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:12,160
Pressure.

1569
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:15,760
Take a big whiff.

1570
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:19,000
All rise!

1571
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:21,520
The Honorable Armand Poe presiding.

1572
01:37:28,920 --> 01:37:30,360
Please be seated.

1573
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:36,600
All right, Mr. Lomax...

1574
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:38,720
you may present your case.

1575
01:37:58,280 --> 01:37:59,520
Mr. Lomax...

1576
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:23,320
I call Melissa Black.

1577
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:42,680
Raise your right hand.

1578
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:44,840
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth...

1579
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:47,160
nothing but the truth, so help you God?

1580
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:48,280
I do.

1581
01:39:14,720 --> 01:39:16,560
Feeney, it's him.

1582
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:22,560
She didn't Look well.
FeIix tried to talk to her.

1583
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:25,240
- Where is she?
- Church of the Heavenly Hope.

1584
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,080
Honey.

1585
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:55,680
It's me.

1586
01:39:56,680 --> 01:39:57,920
What happened?

1587
01:39:58,160 --> 01:39:59,400
Are you okay?

1588
01:40:00,240 --> 01:40:03,040
He Let himself in. You need to know that.

1589
01:40:03,680 --> 01:40:05,320
Who Let himself in?

1590
01:40:06,160 --> 01:40:07,360
The bath...

1591
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:09,520
was running or something.

1592
01:40:10,160 --> 01:40:12,320
I didn't hear him. I swear to you.

1593
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:14,080
And then we talked.

1594
01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:17,440
And we talked for hours.

1595
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:19,840
And I haven't talked to anyone...

1596
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,520
really talked to anyone in so long.

1597
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:25,280
Did somebody hurt you?

1598
01:40:26,120 --> 01:40:27,280
Yeah.

1599
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:29,160
Who?

1600
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:32,600
Milton.

1601
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:35,920
What?

1602
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:43,960
He fucked me.

1603
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:50,200
And I think I wanted him to, but then I just...

1604
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:53,000
I don't know, I just couldn't stop him.

1605
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:56,240
He just wouldn't stop.

1606
01:40:59,160 --> 01:41:00,240
When?

1607
01:41:01,400 --> 01:41:03,400
- Baby, when?
- Today.

1608
01:41:05,240 --> 01:41:06,760
The whole afternoon.

1609
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:09,160
The whole afternoon.

1610
01:41:11,240 --> 01:41:12,560
I'm so ashamed.

1611
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:14,960
Today?

1612
01:41:17,400 --> 01:41:18,560
Today?

1613
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:21,440
Today he was in court.

1614
01:41:21,640 --> 01:41:24,600
He was in court in my presence all afternoon!

1615
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:26,000
- No!
- Yes!

1616
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,400
God, no, Kevin.

1617
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:34,840
Kevin, I'm not crazy.

1618
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:36,920
You have to believe me.

1619
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:43,760
Oh, Jesus.

1620
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:45,840
He did this to me!

1621
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:51,040
He did this to me.

1622
01:41:51,120 --> 01:41:53,120
What did you do to yourself?

1623
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:55,120
What are we going to do?

1624
01:41:55,960 --> 01:41:57,560
What am I going to do?

1625
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:03,360
Sign there. And your relationship.

1626
01:42:04,360 --> 01:42:08,200
She's calm now. This might be a good
time to say good night to her.

1627
01:42:16,640 --> 01:42:19,040
I know why this is happening.

1628
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:24,280
They want you to sleep.

1629
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:27,480
It's the money.

1630
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:29,640
Blood money.

1631
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:33,720
We just drank it down, both of us.

1632
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:36,080
We knew it.

1633
01:42:37,640 --> 01:42:42,200
Winning those cases, taking the money.
We knew they were guilty.

1634
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,400
But you just kept on winning...

1635
01:42:45,800 --> 01:42:47,080
every time.

1636
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:56,360
And I can't Look at myself in the mirror.

1637
01:42:56,920 --> 01:42:59,120
And then I see a monster.

1638
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:04,200
Don't do this, Kevin.

1639
01:43:04,440 --> 01:43:06,600
Please take me home.

1640
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:09,280
Please don't do this.

1641
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:11,720
I'm not crazy.

1642
01:43:27,160 --> 01:43:29,680
Doesn't Diana Look fabulous?

1643
01:43:38,160 --> 01:43:40,840
Alessandra, you Look ravishing.

1644
01:43:43,200 --> 01:43:44,360
Mrs. SkyIar.

1645
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:52,640
We are here today...

1646
01:43:53,200 --> 01:43:54,960
to remember Eddie Barzoon.

1647
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:56,440
Isn't she Lovely?

1648
01:43:56,560 --> 01:44:00,080
We have gathered to seek shelter in our common grief.

1649
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:03,560
To draw strength toward our tested faith.

1650
01:44:03,680 --> 01:44:05,200
So what do they say?

1651
01:44:05,640 --> 01:44:07,040
How's Mary Ann?

1652
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:08,560
They don't know.

1653
01:44:10,840 --> 01:44:12,320
She's falling apart.

1654
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:14,360
Hallucinations.

1655
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:15,680
Milton...

1656
01:44:17,680 --> 01:44:18,720
It's bad.

1657
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:23,120
Do you have room for one more?

1658
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:24,560
Beloved father.

1659
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:26,080
Devoted husband.

1660
01:44:26,520 --> 01:44:27,800
Trusted friend.

1661
01:44:27,880 --> 01:44:30,360
Esteemed colleague. Benevolent citizen.

1662
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:32,520
All of these things.

1663
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:35,520
And yet one thing more:

1664
01:44:36,360 --> 01:44:38,080
Child of God.

1665
01:44:38,920 --> 01:44:42,080
And it is to that Father that he now returns.

1666
01:44:43,080 --> 01:44:44,720
Eddie Barzoon...

1667
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:47,720
such a vibrant member of our community...

1668
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:50,600
has moved beyond us now.

1669
01:44:51,400 --> 01:44:53,040
He has entered...

1670
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:54,960
a new communion.

1671
01:44:55,920 --> 01:44:58,320
And for that it is a time of rejoicing.

1672
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:03,080
God, who is our refuge and our strength.

1673
01:45:04,280 --> 01:45:06,840
God, who is that very present help...

1674
01:45:07,280 --> 01:45:08,840
in time of trouble.

1675
01:45:09,880 --> 01:45:12,280
''Therefore we will not fear...

1676
01:45:13,080 --> 01:45:15,040
though the Earth should change...

1677
01:45:15,120 --> 01:45:18,040
though the mountains shake in the heart of the sea...

1678
01:45:18,120 --> 01:45:20,480
though its waters roar and foam...

1679
01:45:20,920 --> 01:45:23,840
though the mountains tremble with its tumult. ''

1680
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:25,880
We cannot fear too long...

1681
01:45:26,440 --> 01:45:28,040
for Eddie Barzoon...

1682
01:45:28,120 --> 01:45:29,600
has gone home.

1683
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:50,040
Mr. Lomax?

1684
01:45:50,160 --> 01:45:52,480
No comment. I'll have something for you later.

1685
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:54,160
I'm a friend of Eddie Barzoon.

1686
01:45:54,240 --> 01:45:56,680
You don't know me, but Eddie mentioned your name.

1687
01:45:56,760 --> 01:45:58,680
Mitch Weaver, Justice Department?

1688
01:45:58,760 --> 01:46:00,040
Staking out the funeral?

1689
01:46:00,120 --> 01:46:01,920
Looking for you, actually.

1690
01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:04,520
I'm in a hurry. I need to talk to my wife.

1691
01:46:04,600 --> 01:46:09,000
Just wanted to ask you, off the record...
I have a few questions about Eddie.

1692
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:28,880
Milton-Chadwick-Waters is a little more than a law firm.

1693
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:30,880
But I assumed you knew that.

1694
01:46:31,320 --> 01:46:33,880
Vagada Holdings?
I'm sure you've heard of it.

1695
01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:37,480
London, Kinshasa, Karachi: arms brokering, mostly.

1696
01:46:37,640 --> 01:46:41,520
Munzer-Dietch, in BerIin, Djakarta:
chemical weapons and toxic waste.

1697
01:46:41,680 --> 01:46:44,920
Ivanco Limited, Moscow: money laundering for the eastern bloc.

1698
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:49,000
It goes on and on and on.
Milton is into everything.

1699
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:03,560
Barzoon was coming in, Kevin.
He was going to testify.

1700
01:47:03,880 --> 01:47:05,880
DeSoto and Diballsta, Panama.

1701
01:47:06,040 --> 01:47:09,080
That firm sets up bank accounts
for judges in South America.

1702
01:47:09,160 --> 01:47:11,600
Huge drug cases, murder, everything.

1703
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:14,560
What the fuck do you want?
He's a Lawyer!

1704
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:17,560
Now stay off my back!

1705
01:47:21,480 --> 01:47:23,920
This is a first-time last-time offer.

1706
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:26,160
I'm learning about you.

1707
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:29,240
I talked to some old friends in Florida this morning.

1708
01:47:29,320 --> 01:47:30,480
The Gettys case?

1709
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:32,400
Eighth grade teacher?

1710
01:47:34,480 --> 01:47:36,240
They found him yesterday!

1711
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:41,280
He had the body of a 10-year-old girl
in the trunk of his car!

1712
01:48:01,120 --> 01:48:03,120
Is he all right? Get help!

1713
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,480
Marie, do you want to go to the party?

1714
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:29,920
Come on.

1715
01:48:30,040 --> 01:48:31,400
Horace will be disappointed.

1716
01:48:31,480 --> 01:48:33,760
It's a birthday party. We can sing.

1717
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:35,960
''indeed, His divine power...

1718
01:48:36,160 --> 01:48:40,160
has granted us all things pertaining to life and piety...

1719
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:43,880
through the knowledge of Him who has called us... ''

1720
01:48:47,240 --> 01:48:48,960
What are you doing here?

1721
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:51,640
I came this morning.

1722
01:48:53,080 --> 01:48:55,840
I kept calling the house and getting no answer.

1723
01:48:56,160 --> 01:48:57,840
I need to talk to you.

1724
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,720
We got her on the first fLight up this morning.

1725
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:11,280
Are you all right, Kevin?

1726
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:19,400
I don't know.

1727
01:49:22,640 --> 01:49:25,440
Would you excuse us for a moment, please?

1728
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:30,040
How you doing, sweetie?

1729
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:33,680
I know something that'll make you feel better.

1730
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:35,120
There.

1731
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:41,080
I shouldn't have left. I knew it.

1732
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:44,360
I'll never forgive myself.

1733
01:49:45,160 --> 01:49:48,960
- There's nothing you could've done.
- I could've told you the truth.

1734
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:51,680
About what?

1735
01:49:52,440 --> 01:49:55,600
Baptist Endeavor Youth Crusade, 1966.

1736
01:49:56,400 --> 01:49:58,440
I was here in New York.

1737
01:49:59,320 --> 01:50:02,320
That night in the elevator, you never Let me answer.

1738
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:04,920
What are you talking about?

1739
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:08,080
I stayed here a week in the Tremont Hotel.

1740
01:50:09,240 --> 01:50:12,520
They had a restaurant downstairs
where we ate almost every meal.

1741
01:50:12,600 --> 01:50:13,720
Wait. Stop.

1742
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:16,480
Your father was a waiter in that restaurant.

1743
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:19,600
My father?

1744
01:50:23,640 --> 01:50:25,600
This is great, Ma.

1745
01:50:28,280 --> 01:50:29,360
Honey, please Listen.

1746
01:50:29,480 --> 01:50:30,400
Now?

1747
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:32,120
You do this now?

1748
01:50:32,480 --> 01:50:34,400
Your timing, it's superb.

1749
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:37,440
You wait 30 years, you fly up here, you pick today?

1750
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:43,160
Obviously I'm not under enough pressure.
I don't have enough on my mind!

1751
01:50:45,480 --> 01:50:47,040
Listen to me!

1752
01:50:52,920 --> 01:50:57,000
''Behold, I send you out as sheep amidst the wolves!''

1753
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,480
Don't you Look beautifuI now.

1754
01:51:09,640 --> 01:51:11,120
Take a Look and see.

1755
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:14,120
It's all right, dear. Look.

1756
01:51:14,240 --> 01:51:15,160
No.

1757
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:17,160
Go on, take a Look.

1758
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:19,840
See how beautifuI you are?

1759
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:28,240
See?

1760
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:37,160
What happened?

1761
01:51:37,240 --> 01:51:38,640
She attacked me.

1762
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:44,320
Open the door.

1763
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:46,560
Open the door, Mar.

1764
01:51:50,040 --> 01:51:51,680
Open the door!

1765
01:51:55,200 --> 01:51:56,360
It's okay.

1766
01:51:56,560 --> 01:51:57,840
Open the door!

1767
01:51:59,720 --> 01:52:01,200
Come on!

1768
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:02,840
Open the door!

1769
01:52:06,160 --> 01:52:07,600
Open the door, Mar!

1770
01:52:08,200 --> 01:52:11,720
Oh, my God! Get somebody! Go! Go!
Mar, Look at me!

1771
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:14,080
Somebody! Help!

1772
01:52:16,680 --> 01:52:17,760
Get help!

1773
01:52:18,400 --> 01:52:19,840
Go!

1774
01:52:26,240 --> 01:52:27,360
Sweetheart!

1775
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:33,080
Look at me!

1776
01:52:33,240 --> 01:52:34,520
I Love you.

1777
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:45,440
What have you done?

1778
01:52:45,520 --> 01:52:47,240
What have you done?

1779
01:52:48,920 --> 01:52:51,280
We need a doctor in here!

1780
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:53,800
We need a doctor!

1781
01:52:55,720 --> 01:52:58,560
Please stay with me, Mar!

1782
01:52:59,960 --> 01:53:01,400
Stay with me, Mar!

1783
01:53:01,560 --> 01:53:03,600
Get Dr. Job in here now!

1784
01:53:03,960 --> 01:53:06,920
Sir, get away so that I can help her. Now!

1785
01:53:07,400 --> 01:53:09,120
Sir, off! Go!

1786
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:11,200
Come on. Come on.

1787
01:53:12,280 --> 01:53:15,120
- Help her.
- Out of the way.

1788
01:53:15,720 --> 01:53:18,560
Get Dr. Job, please! I'm losing her!

1789
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:35,800
Finish the story.

1790
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:38,920
1966. You were in New York.

1791
01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:41,240
There's a waiter in a restaurant.

1792
01:53:41,320 --> 01:53:42,680
Finish the story.

1793
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:48,000
He talked to me.

1794
01:53:48,840 --> 01:53:51,640
Nobody'd ever really talked to me before.

1795
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:56,520
Sixteen years old, a thousand miles away
from home, someone takes an interest...

1796
01:53:56,840 --> 01:54:00,160
Knew the Bible, every word.
Just knew it by heart.

1797
01:54:02,680 --> 01:54:05,760
Every meaI, there he was at my ear and I was...

1798
01:54:06,920 --> 01:54:10,520
That last night he came to say good-bye and...

1799
01:54:12,760 --> 01:54:14,360
I started crying.

1800
01:54:14,520 --> 01:54:16,520
And he told me:

1801
01:54:18,040 --> 01:54:21,680
''Behold, I send you out as sheep amidst the wolves. ''

1802
01:54:22,200 --> 01:54:24,120
I want to hear you say it.

1803
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:28,800
His face that night, I knew it was him.

1804
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:29,720
Say it.

1805
01:54:29,800 --> 01:54:34,440
You were so proud you'd just come to
New York and done this all on your own.

1806
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:39,600
I didn't have the heart to tell you.
You wondered yourself. The money...

1807
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:42,720
that apartment, the attention,
everything out of nowhere!

1808
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:43,800
Say it!

1809
01:54:44,800 --> 01:54:46,720
Milton, he's your...

1810
01:54:47,320 --> 01:54:48,440
father.

1811
01:54:49,240 --> 01:54:50,800
He's your father.

1812
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:54,080
Somehow he found us.

1813
01:54:54,240 --> 01:54:55,920
- He tracked you down.
- No.

1814
01:54:56,320 --> 01:54:57,160
He did.

1815
01:54:57,240 --> 01:54:59,240
He's always been there.

1816
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:02,320
I know that now.

1817
01:55:03,640 --> 01:55:04,840
Watching.

1818
01:55:05,720 --> 01:55:06,720
Waiting.

1819
01:55:08,520 --> 01:55:10,480
Playing us Like a game.

1820
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:12,000
What do you mean?

1821
01:55:12,080 --> 01:55:13,440
I gotta go.

1822
01:55:14,760 --> 01:55:17,160
No, leave it alone. Stay here with me.

1823
01:55:17,240 --> 01:55:19,640
Forget about him. We can leave here.

1824
01:55:19,840 --> 01:55:22,520
We can go home.
We don't ever have to see him again.

1825
01:55:22,600 --> 01:55:23,840
I can't do it.

1826
01:55:25,080 --> 01:55:26,880
You go home. You go home.

1827
01:55:27,600 --> 01:55:28,760
I have to go.

1828
01:55:28,840 --> 01:55:30,960
- I have to go.
- Wait!

1829
01:55:32,080 --> 01:55:33,240
I Love you.

1830
01:55:43,160 --> 01:55:44,760
There you are.

1831
01:55:45,640 --> 01:55:48,120
Look at you. You're terrified.

1832
01:55:48,360 --> 01:55:49,800
Not to worry.

1833
01:55:49,960 --> 01:55:51,720
He'll take away that fear.

1834
01:55:51,800 --> 01:55:54,400
You don't ever have to be frightened again.

1835
01:55:54,680 --> 01:55:55,800
Go on.

1836
01:55:55,960 --> 01:55:57,560
He's waiting for you.

1837
01:55:58,280 --> 01:55:59,280
Go.

1838
01:57:12,640 --> 01:57:14,400
You were right about one thing.

1839
01:57:14,480 --> 01:57:17,480
I have been watching.
Couldn't help myself.

1840
01:57:18,280 --> 01:57:19,320
Watching.

1841
01:57:20,120 --> 01:57:21,160
Waiting.

1842
01:57:22,160 --> 01:57:23,640
Holding my breath.

1843
01:57:24,160 --> 01:57:26,600
But I'm no puppeteer, Kevin.

1844
01:57:27,880 --> 01:57:30,040
I don't make things happen.

1845
01:57:30,400 --> 01:57:31,640
Doesn't work Like that.

1846
01:57:31,720 --> 01:57:33,520
What'd you do to Mary Ann?

1847
01:57:33,600 --> 01:57:35,240
Free will.

1848
01:57:35,400 --> 01:57:37,480
It's Like butterfly wings.

1849
01:57:37,600 --> 01:57:40,240
Once touched, they never get off the ground.

1850
01:57:41,960 --> 01:57:44,400
I only set the stage.

1851
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:46,240
You pull your own strings.

1852
01:57:46,320 --> 01:57:48,600
What did you do to Mary Ann?

1853
01:57:48,760 --> 01:57:50,240
A gun?

1854
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:51,560
In here?

1855
01:57:51,720 --> 01:57:54,360
Goddamn it, what did you do to my wife?

1856
01:57:55,800 --> 01:57:56,920
Well...

1857
01:57:58,760 --> 01:58:01,000
on a scale of one to ten...

1858
01:58:01,240 --> 01:58:05,240
Ten being the most depraved act
of sexual theater known to man.

1859
01:58:05,400 --> 01:58:09,240
One being your average Friday night
run-through at the Lomaxes'.

1860
01:58:09,600 --> 01:58:11,680
I'd say, not to be immodest...

1861
01:58:11,800 --> 01:58:15,640
Mary Ann and I got it on at about seven.

1862
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:17,080
Fuck you!

1863
01:58:18,760 --> 01:58:20,360
Got me!

1864
01:58:20,440 --> 01:58:22,360
Got me! Yes!

1865
01:58:26,760 --> 01:58:29,440
Step it up, Son! Come on! That's good!

1866
01:58:29,640 --> 01:58:31,960
You got to hold on to that fury!

1867
01:58:32,120 --> 01:58:33,560
That's the last thing to go!

1868
01:58:33,640 --> 01:58:38,240
That's the finaI hiding place.
It's the final fig leaf.

1869
01:58:39,120 --> 01:58:41,080
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

1870
01:58:41,960 --> 01:58:43,120
Who are you?

1871
01:58:44,600 --> 01:58:46,400
Never Lost a case.

1872
01:58:48,040 --> 01:58:49,120
Why?

1873
01:58:49,680 --> 01:58:51,040
Why do you think?

1874
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:54,160
Because you're so fucking good.

1875
01:58:54,640 --> 01:58:55,720
Yes.

1876
01:58:56,440 --> 01:58:57,440
But why?

1877
01:58:59,560 --> 01:59:01,320
Because you're my father?

1878
01:59:01,680 --> 01:59:04,080
I'm a little more than that, Kevin.

1879
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:07,760
Awfully hot in that courtroom, wasn't it?

1880
01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:10,320
''What's the game plan, Kevin?''

1881
01:59:11,480 --> 01:59:13,040
''It was a nice run, Kev.

1882
01:59:13,120 --> 01:59:15,080
Had to close out some day.

1883
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:17,280
Nobody wins them all. ''

1884
01:59:19,080 --> 01:59:20,280
What are you?

1885
01:59:23,720 --> 01:59:25,960
I have so many names.

1886
01:59:27,800 --> 01:59:28,800
Satan.

1887
01:59:31,600 --> 01:59:32,880
Call me Dad.

1888
01:59:36,120 --> 01:59:37,760
Mary Ann, she knew it.

1889
01:59:38,960 --> 01:59:42,000
She knew it. She knew it, so you destroyed her.

1890
01:59:42,160 --> 01:59:44,640
You're blaming me for Mary Ann?

1891
01:59:45,160 --> 01:59:46,760
I hope you're kidding.

1892
01:59:47,120 --> 01:59:49,880
Mary Ann, you could have saved
her anytime you Liked.

1893
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:51,640
All she wanted was Love.

1894
01:59:51,800 --> 01:59:53,800
Hey, you were too busy.

1895
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:55,200
That's a lie.

1896
01:59:56,640 --> 02:00:00,760
Face it, you started Looking to better-deal
her the minute you got here.

1897
02:00:01,040 --> 02:00:04,240
That's not true. You don't know what we had!

1898
02:00:04,400 --> 02:00:05,760
I'm on your side!

1899
02:00:05,840 --> 02:00:07,200
You're a liar!

1900
02:00:09,160 --> 02:00:11,600
There's nothing out there for you!

1901
02:00:11,680 --> 02:00:14,520
Don't be such a fucking chump!

1902
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,520
Stop deluding yourself!

1903
02:00:18,640 --> 02:00:20,920
I told you to take care of your wife!

1904
02:00:21,120 --> 02:00:22,400
What did I say?

1905
02:00:22,560 --> 02:00:26,000
''The world would understand. ''
Didn't I say that?

1906
02:00:26,200 --> 02:00:27,520
What did you do?

1907
02:00:28,520 --> 02:00:30,520
''You know what scares me, John?

1908
02:00:30,680 --> 02:00:34,880
I leave the case, she gets better
and then I hate her for it. ''

1909
02:00:35,560 --> 02:00:37,040
Remember?

1910
02:00:37,960 --> 02:00:39,520
I know what you did.

1911
02:00:39,680 --> 02:00:40,960
You set me up.

1912
02:00:41,040 --> 02:00:43,360
Who told you to pull out all the stops on Mr. Gettys?

1913
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:46,640
- Who made that choice?
- It's entrapment. You set me up.

1914
02:00:46,720 --> 02:00:49,560
And Moyez! The direction you took!

1915
02:00:49,720 --> 02:00:53,880
Popes, swamis, snake handlers,
all feeding at the same trough.

1916
02:00:54,040 --> 02:00:56,480
- Whose ideas were those?
- You played me!

1917
02:00:56,680 --> 02:00:58,200
It was a test! Your test!

1918
02:00:58,320 --> 02:01:01,400
And Cullen! Knowing he was guilty!

1919
02:01:02,240 --> 02:01:03,960
Seeing those pictures!

1920
02:01:04,040 --> 02:01:07,720
What did you do?
You put that lying bitch on the stand!

1921
02:01:07,880 --> 02:01:11,120
You brought me in. You put me there!
You made her lie!

1922
02:01:11,200 --> 02:01:13,120
I don't do that, Kevin!

1923
02:01:13,200 --> 02:01:15,920
That day on the subway, what did I say to you?

1924
02:01:16,200 --> 02:01:18,200
What were my words to you?

1925
02:01:19,560 --> 02:01:23,200
Maybe it was your time to Lose.
You didn't think so.

1926
02:01:23,320 --> 02:01:25,400
Lose? I don't Lose!

1927
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:26,960
I win!

1928
02:01:27,200 --> 02:01:28,640
I win!

1929
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:31,880
I'm a Lawyer! That's my job!
That's what I do!

1930
02:01:34,080 --> 02:01:35,360
I rest my case.

1931
02:01:40,720 --> 02:01:42,280
Vanity...

1932
02:01:42,760 --> 02:01:45,400
is definitely my favorite sin.

1933
02:01:46,840 --> 02:01:49,360
Kevin, it's so basic.

1934
02:01:49,600 --> 02:01:50,920
Self-Love.

1935
02:01:51,120 --> 02:01:53,720
The all-natural opiate.

1936
02:01:54,760 --> 02:01:58,160
It's not that you didn't care for Mary Ann, Kevin...

1937
02:01:59,240 --> 02:02:03,120
it's just that you were a little more
involved with someone else.

1938
02:02:04,880 --> 02:02:06,480
Yourself.

1939
02:02:09,240 --> 02:02:10,480
You're right.

1940
02:02:10,880 --> 02:02:12,280
I did it all.

1941
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:14,040
I Let her go.

1942
02:02:14,120 --> 02:02:18,520
Don't be too hard on yourself, Kevin.
You wanted something more.

1943
02:02:18,680 --> 02:02:19,960
Believe me.

1944
02:02:21,120 --> 02:02:23,480
I left her behind and just kept going.

1945
02:02:23,640 --> 02:02:25,760
You can't keep punishing yourself.

1946
02:02:26,640 --> 02:02:29,480
It's awesome how far you've come.

1947
02:02:30,040 --> 02:02:31,880
I didn't make it easy.

1948
02:02:32,280 --> 02:02:33,480
Couldn't.

1949
02:02:34,320 --> 02:02:35,800
Not for you...

1950
02:02:38,760 --> 02:02:40,240
or your sister.

1951
02:02:44,800 --> 02:02:46,800
Half-sister, to be exact.

1952
02:02:47,480 --> 02:02:49,000
Surprise.

1953
02:02:49,840 --> 02:02:51,480
Some scene, huh?

1954
02:02:55,280 --> 02:02:57,000
Don't Let him scare you.

1955
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,160
I've had so many children.

1956
02:03:00,680 --> 02:03:03,440
I've had so many disappointments.

1957
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,040
Mistake after mistake.

1958
02:03:06,240 --> 02:03:07,800
And then there's you.

1959
02:03:07,920 --> 02:03:09,200
The two of you.

1960
02:03:12,360 --> 02:03:14,000
What do you want from me?

1961
02:03:14,120 --> 02:03:15,880
I want you to be yourself.

1962
02:03:16,200 --> 02:03:17,880
You know, I'll tell you, boy...

1963
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:19,200
guilt...

1964
02:03:19,360 --> 02:03:21,680
it's Like a bag of fucking bricks.

1965
02:03:21,760 --> 02:03:23,440
All you got to do...

1966
02:03:23,760 --> 02:03:25,360
is set it down.

1967
02:03:28,600 --> 02:03:30,800
I know what you're going through.

1968
02:03:30,880 --> 02:03:32,200
I've been there.

1969
02:03:32,440 --> 02:03:34,280
Just come here. Come here.

1970
02:03:34,440 --> 02:03:35,960
Let it go.

1971
02:03:37,440 --> 02:03:39,160
I can't do that.

1972
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:45,840
Who are you carrying all those bricks for?

1973
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:47,920
God?

1974
02:03:48,080 --> 02:03:49,480
Is that it?

1975
02:03:49,640 --> 02:03:50,800
God?

1976
02:03:51,040 --> 02:03:52,320
I'll tell you...

1977
02:03:52,400 --> 02:03:55,840
Let me give you a little inside information about God.

1978
02:03:56,400 --> 02:03:58,240
God Likes to watch.

1979
02:03:58,400 --> 02:03:59,800
He's a prankster.

1980
02:03:59,880 --> 02:04:01,240
Think about it.

1981
02:04:01,560 --> 02:04:03,240
He gives man...

1982
02:04:03,400 --> 02:04:04,800
instincts.

1983
02:04:05,640 --> 02:04:09,240
He gives you this extraordinary gift,
and then what does He do?

1984
02:04:09,400 --> 02:04:12,280
I swear, for his own amusement...

1985
02:04:12,400 --> 02:04:15,360
his own private, cosmic...

1986
02:04:15,480 --> 02:04:16,840
gag reel...

1987
02:04:17,640 --> 02:04:20,080
He sets the rules in opposition.

1988
02:04:20,240 --> 02:04:21,760
It's the goof of all time.

1989
02:04:21,840 --> 02:04:24,160
Look, but don't touch.

1990
02:04:25,840 --> 02:04:28,160
Touch, but don't taste.

1991
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,280
Taste, but don't swallow.

1992
02:04:33,520 --> 02:04:37,440
And while you're jumping from one foot
to the next, what is He doing?

1993
02:04:37,600 --> 02:04:41,120
He's laughing his sick, fucking ass off!

1994
02:04:41,400 --> 02:04:42,880
He's a tightass!

1995
02:04:43,080 --> 02:04:45,360
He's a sadist!

1996
02:04:45,880 --> 02:04:48,520
He's an absentee landlord!

1997
02:04:48,680 --> 02:04:51,000
Worship that? Never!

1998
02:04:51,800 --> 02:04:54,960
''Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven, '' is that it?

1999
02:04:55,040 --> 02:04:56,200
Why not?

2000
02:04:56,440 --> 02:05:01,120
I'm here on the ground with my nose in it
since the whole thing began!

2001
02:05:02,040 --> 02:05:06,560
I've nurtured every sensation man
has been inspired to have!

2002
02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:10,480
I cared about what he wanted and I never judged him!

2003
02:05:10,600 --> 02:05:15,200
Why? Because I never rejected him,
in spite of all his imperfections!

2004
02:05:15,400 --> 02:05:17,480
I'm a fan of man!

2005
02:05:19,400 --> 02:05:20,800
I'm a humanist.

2006
02:05:21,160 --> 02:05:23,040
Maybe the last humanist.

2007
02:05:24,040 --> 02:05:26,080
Who, in their right mind...

2008
02:05:26,160 --> 02:05:28,480
Kevin, could possibly deny...

2009
02:05:28,640 --> 02:05:31,480
the 20th century was entirely mine?

2010
02:05:31,640 --> 02:05:34,120
All of it, Kevin!

2011
02:05:34,640 --> 02:05:36,040
All of it.

2012
02:05:36,680 --> 02:05:37,920
Mine.

2013
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:40,680
I'm peaking, Kevin.

2014
02:05:41,560 --> 02:05:42,920
It's my time now.

2015
02:05:44,920 --> 02:05:46,200
It's our time.

2016
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:48,560
Anybody want a drink?

2017
02:05:50,440 --> 02:05:52,000
I'm having a drink.

2018
02:05:55,360 --> 02:05:57,560
This is some pitch, all this.

2019
02:05:58,720 --> 02:06:00,480
You must need me pretty bad.

2020
02:06:00,560 --> 02:06:02,000
What do you want?

2021
02:06:03,400 --> 02:06:04,720
Eddie was right.

2022
02:06:06,040 --> 02:06:08,200
I want you to take over the firm.

2023
02:06:08,920 --> 02:06:10,000
You...

2024
02:06:11,160 --> 02:06:12,600
and your sister.

2025
02:06:16,880 --> 02:06:18,760
- Is that it?
- No.

2026
02:06:21,080 --> 02:06:22,880
She's ovulating...

2027
02:06:23,240 --> 02:06:24,520
right now.

2028
02:06:25,720 --> 02:06:27,160
Your vanity...

2029
02:06:27,360 --> 02:06:29,880
is justified, Kevin.

2030
02:06:31,200 --> 02:06:32,440
Your seed...

2031
02:06:32,600 --> 02:06:34,560
is the key to a new future.

2032
02:06:35,200 --> 02:06:39,080
Your son is going to sit at the head of all tables, my boy.

2033
02:06:39,720 --> 02:06:42,360
He's gonna set this whole thing free.

2034
02:06:43,720 --> 02:06:45,240
You want a child.

2035
02:06:45,600 --> 02:06:47,440
I want a family.

2036
02:06:48,560 --> 02:06:49,960
The Antichrist.

2037
02:06:54,600 --> 02:06:56,120
Whatever.

2038
02:07:00,640 --> 02:07:02,800
But I have to volunteer.

2039
02:07:04,280 --> 02:07:06,080
Free will...

2040
02:07:06,640 --> 02:07:08,040
it is a bitch.

2041
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:11,920
I need a family.

2042
02:07:12,080 --> 02:07:14,120
I need help. I'm busy.

2043
02:07:14,320 --> 02:07:16,080
Millennium's coming, Son.

2044
02:07:16,280 --> 02:07:18,960
Title fight. Round 20.

2045
02:07:20,960 --> 02:07:22,960
I'm ready to work.

2046
02:07:24,640 --> 02:07:26,040
What do you say?

2047
02:07:26,960 --> 02:07:28,520
What're you offering?

2048
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:32,480
Are we negotiating?

2049
02:07:32,600 --> 02:07:33,720
Always.

2050
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:37,440
Yes!

2051
02:07:38,960 --> 02:07:40,520
What are you offering?

2052
02:07:41,320 --> 02:07:42,640
Everything.

2053
02:07:42,800 --> 02:07:43,920
Anything.

2054
02:07:44,080 --> 02:07:46,560
What do you want?
How about bliss, for starters?

2055
02:07:46,640 --> 02:07:47,760
Instant bliss.

2056
02:07:47,840 --> 02:07:49,320
Bliss on tap.

2057
02:07:50,600 --> 02:07:53,000
Bliss any way you want it.

2058
02:07:55,640 --> 02:07:57,760
That first line of cocaine.

2059
02:07:58,320 --> 02:08:01,000
That walk into a strange girl's bedroom.

2060
02:08:02,800 --> 02:08:03,920
Familiar?

2061
02:08:05,360 --> 02:08:08,080
You're gonna have to do a little better than that.

2062
02:08:08,160 --> 02:08:09,360
I know.

2063
02:08:10,160 --> 02:08:11,960
I'm just getting warmed up.

2064
02:08:12,320 --> 02:08:16,000
You want more, don't you?
You deserve more.

2065
02:08:16,160 --> 02:08:18,480
How about the thing you Love the most?

2066
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:20,720
A smile from a jury.

2067
02:08:21,040 --> 02:08:25,160
That cold courtroom just giving itself over...

2068
02:08:26,320 --> 02:08:28,480
bending to your strength.

2069
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:31,600
I get that on my own.

2070
02:08:31,720 --> 02:08:33,640
Not Like this.

2071
02:08:33,800 --> 02:08:36,200
I take the bricks out of the briefcase.

2072
02:08:36,400 --> 02:08:37,880
I give you pleasure.

2073
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:40,160
No strings!

2074
02:08:40,360 --> 02:08:41,720
Freedom, baby...

2075
02:08:42,040 --> 02:08:44,560
is never having to say you're sorry.

2076
02:08:46,200 --> 02:08:48,080
This is revolution, Kevin.

2077
02:08:50,840 --> 02:08:52,040
''It happened

2078
02:08:53,200 --> 02:08:54,680
In Monterrey

2079
02:08:56,040 --> 02:08:57,880
A long time ago''

2080
02:08:58,920 --> 02:09:00,520
Forget about him.

2081
02:09:01,240 --> 02:09:02,640
This is about us.

2082
02:09:04,040 --> 02:09:06,040
''In old Mexico

2083
02:09:07,920 --> 02:09:11,920
Stars and steel guitars and luscious lips

2084
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:13,720
As red as wine''

2085
02:09:13,880 --> 02:09:16,520
It's been so hard for me to wait for you.

2086
02:09:17,760 --> 02:09:19,080
Why the law?

2087
02:09:20,360 --> 02:09:23,360
Cut the shit, Dad! Why Lawyers?
Why the law?

2088
02:09:23,440 --> 02:09:27,280
Because the law, my boy, puts us into everything.

2089
02:09:28,280 --> 02:09:32,680
It's the ultimate backstage pass.
It's the new priesthood, baby.

2090
02:09:33,280 --> 02:09:36,200
Did you know there are more students in law school...

2091
02:09:36,280 --> 02:09:38,360
than Lawyers walking the Earth?

2092
02:09:38,440 --> 02:09:39,960
We're coming out...

2093
02:09:40,680 --> 02:09:42,360
guns blazing!

2094
02:09:43,680 --> 02:09:45,440
The two of you...

2095
02:09:45,600 --> 02:09:49,640
all of us, acquittal after acquittal after acquittal...

2096
02:09:49,720 --> 02:09:53,440
until the stench of it reaches so
high and far into Heaven...

2097
02:09:53,640 --> 02:09:57,040
it chokes the whole fucking lot of them!

2098
02:09:59,120 --> 02:10:01,200
In the Bible, you Lose.

2099
02:10:02,560 --> 02:10:04,560
We're destined to Lose, Dad.

2100
02:10:04,680 --> 02:10:06,760
Consider the source, Son!

2101
02:10:08,480 --> 02:10:09,560
Besides...

2102
02:10:09,720 --> 02:10:11,640
we'll write our own book.

2103
02:10:11,720 --> 02:10:13,560
Chapter one.

2104
02:10:14,480 --> 02:10:16,560
Right here. This altar.

2105
02:10:17,400 --> 02:10:18,800
This moment.

2106
02:10:19,400 --> 02:10:21,000
Will you stop talking?

2107
02:10:21,080 --> 02:10:22,480
You talk too much.

2108
02:10:23,080 --> 02:10:24,400
Both of you.

2109
02:10:27,680 --> 02:10:28,840
Look at me.

2110
02:10:30,320 --> 02:10:31,760
Just Look at me.

2111
02:10:41,680 --> 02:10:44,400
She is really stunning.

2112
02:10:50,600 --> 02:10:52,000
Who am I?

2113
02:11:12,040 --> 02:11:14,560
I've wanted you from the moment we met.

2114
02:11:24,120 --> 02:11:26,800
The virtue of the Devil is in his loins.

2115
02:11:30,640 --> 02:11:32,160
What about Love?

2116
02:11:36,160 --> 02:11:37,280
Overrated.

2117
02:11:37,720 --> 02:11:38,680
Biochemically...

2118
02:11:38,760 --> 02:11:43,240
no different than eating large quantities of chocolate.

2119
02:11:45,080 --> 02:11:48,640
In two minutes you won't be thinking
about Mary Ann ever again.

2120
02:11:48,920 --> 02:11:50,160
Come here.

2121
02:11:51,760 --> 02:11:53,880
She's right, my son.

2122
02:12:00,680 --> 02:12:04,440
It's time to step up and take what's yours.

2123
02:12:09,360 --> 02:12:10,600
You're right.

2124
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:14,440
It's time.

2125
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:16,760
Free will, right?

2126
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:23,160
No!

2127
02:12:37,240 --> 02:12:38,760
Damn you!

2128
02:12:42,040 --> 02:12:44,040
Enough!

2129
02:12:45,960 --> 02:12:48,560
Haven't I given enough?

2130
02:13:52,520 --> 02:13:54,040
It was a nice run.

2131
02:13:54,280 --> 02:13:56,280
Had to close out someday.

2132
02:13:57,120 --> 02:13:58,720
Nobody wins them all.

2133
02:14:48,240 --> 02:14:50,320
What are you doing, baby?

2134
02:14:52,360 --> 02:14:53,720
Are you okay?

2135
02:14:56,760 --> 02:14:58,360
I am now.

2136
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:03,600
All rise.

2137
02:15:04,040 --> 02:15:07,080
The Honorable Judge Garson Deeds presiding.

2138
02:15:10,040 --> 02:15:11,520
Please be seated.

2139
02:15:15,600 --> 02:15:18,280
You're still under oath, young lady.

2140
02:15:21,400 --> 02:15:22,680
Your witness.

2141
02:15:34,560 --> 02:15:36,040
Mr. Lomax?

2142
02:15:40,720 --> 02:15:41,920
Your Honor...

2143
02:15:43,720 --> 02:15:45,760
I'm terribly sorry.

2144
02:15:47,080 --> 02:15:49,560
But I can no longer represent my client.

2145
02:15:52,120 --> 02:15:54,360
I need to be replaced as counsel.

2146
02:15:54,440 --> 02:15:56,600
Order. Order! Order!

2147
02:15:57,600 --> 02:15:59,400
I adjourn this court.

2148
02:15:59,800 --> 02:16:03,360
This is outrageous. Are you aware of
the consequences of this action?

2149
02:16:03,440 --> 02:16:04,640
I am, sir.

2150
02:16:04,800 --> 02:16:08,400
I want to see both attorneys in my chambers immediately.

2151
02:16:08,600 --> 02:16:12,400
I'm going to adjourn this trial until
9 a. m. tomorrow morning.

2152
02:16:13,600 --> 02:16:15,280
I trusted you to defend me.

2153
02:16:15,400 --> 02:16:17,640
You swore you would! You'll burn for this!

2154
02:16:17,720 --> 02:16:20,440
You just made the biggest mistake of your life!

2155
02:16:21,480 --> 02:16:23,480
Baby, what are you doing?

2156
02:16:26,800 --> 02:16:28,320
The right thing.

2157
02:16:29,120 --> 02:16:30,800
I think the right thing.

2158
02:16:34,760 --> 02:16:35,840
Here they are.

2159
02:16:35,920 --> 02:16:37,920
- Are you gonna be disbarred?
- I don't know.

2160
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,760
- How's it feel to Lose your first case?
- No comment.

2161
02:16:40,840 --> 02:16:44,840
Ain't it better to talk to them all at once?
Press conference tomorrow?

2162
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:48,360
He ain't going to talk to you now.
Eight o'clock tomorrow morning.

2163
02:16:48,440 --> 02:16:49,800
That's it.

2164
02:16:49,960 --> 02:16:51,720
This is the story you dreamed about.

2165
02:16:51,800 --> 02:16:54,320
- There is no story.
- Bullshit.

2166
02:16:54,520 --> 02:16:57,920
A Lawyer with a crisis of conscience?
You gotta be kidding. It's huge!

2167
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,840
They're going to disbar me.
Write about that.

2168
02:17:01,840 --> 02:17:04,000
Wait a second. Can they do that?

2169
02:17:04,200 --> 02:17:05,720
Not when I get through with the story.

2170
02:17:05,800 --> 02:17:08,160
You got to give me an exclusive.

2171
02:17:08,320 --> 02:17:12,200
This is wire service. This is ''60 Minutes''.

2172
02:17:12,360 --> 02:17:15,800
This is a story that needs to be told. It's you.

2173
02:17:16,160 --> 02:17:17,680
You're a star.

2174
02:17:21,520 --> 02:17:22,840
Baby.

2175
02:17:25,160 --> 02:17:26,880
Call me in the morning.

2176
02:17:27,520 --> 02:17:30,160
You got it. First thing.

2177
02:17:39,880 --> 02:17:41,200
Vanity...

2178
02:17:41,680 --> 02:17:43,920
definitely my favorite sin.
