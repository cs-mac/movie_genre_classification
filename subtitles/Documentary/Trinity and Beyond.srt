1
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,572
In the movies, Dracula wears a cape,

2
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:37,012
and some old English guy
always manages to save the day

3
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,676
at the last minute
with crosses and holy water.

4
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:43,354
But everybody knows
the movies are full of shit.

5
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:49,191
The truth is it started with Blade,
and it ended with him.

6
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:51,752
The rest of us
were just along for the ride.

7
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,154
What's this chicken scratch?

8
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:05,622
It's cuneiform.

9
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,029
It's about 4,000 years old.

10
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:09,825
So why here?

11
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:12,836
Because this is the cradle of civilization.

12
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,863
He would've been comfortable here.

13
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,433
I don't know, Dan.
This seems like another dead end.

14
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:20,773
There's something beneath us.

15
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,710
You find a watch?

16
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,183
Is it a body?

17
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:32,617
Guys?

18
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:38,095
Aah!

19
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:42,560
Go! Aah!

20
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:44,431
What the fuck?!

21
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,680
Aah!

22
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:08,249
Tonight, Dr. Edgar Vance,
forensic psychiatrist

23
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:14,060
and author of the New York Times
best seller Human Health,

24
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,259
The Whole Being Breakthrough.

25
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:20,361
Also with us, Martin Vreede,
Chief of Police.

26
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:24,203
They'll be here for the next hour,
and they'll be taking your calls,

27
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,677
next on Bently Tittle Live.

28
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:31,179
Okay, Dr. Vance.

29
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:35,777
You are a psychiatrist
and a biochemist. Isn't that true?

30
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:38,345
Yes, Bently. I am both.

31
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:39,913
And it's for a reason.

32
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:44,519
I have always believed
that true health can only be achieved

33
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:47,258
if we reconcile
the body and the mind.

34
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,266
And of course,
in order to do that,

35
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:51,768
we have to get rid
of a lot of old notions.

36
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:55,431
Okay. And...how's that
fit in with vampires?

37
00:04:55,495 --> 00:05:00,672
In the case of vampires,
we're dealing with creatures that, uh,

38
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:04,806
are the repositories of some
of our most taboo thoughts.

39
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,544
- Okay.
- Predatory rage.

40
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:08,517
- Yeah.
- Sexual sadism.

41
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:10,781
- Sexual?
- Sexual sadism.

42
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:13,255
These are very scary subjects
for people to own up to,

43
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,792
and they're right inside.

44
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:19,057
So what you're saying is
we pass the buck onto someone else.

45
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:22,258
- You bet we do.
- And vampires...?

46
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,996
Well, for instance,
there's a hereditary blood disease.

47
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:27,231
I talk about it in my book.
It's called porphyria.

48
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:29,466
And the symptoms of this disease

49
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:33,375
are remarkably similar
to classic vampire traits.

50
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:36,437
The people who suffer
from this disease are anemic,

51
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:40,541
they become intolerant to sunlight,
they can't handle garlic--

52
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:43,109
Garlic?
Chief Vreede. Okay.

53
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:47,124
What's your take on all these rumors
we've been hearing about vampires?

54
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,352
Vampires, vampires. What?

55
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:53,090
The only vampires I'm worried about
are the ones passing the bar exam.

56
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:58,395
Seriously, though.

57
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,803
If vampires existed, don't you think
we would've found them by now?

58
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,808
The truth is our streets
have never been safer.

59
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:08,471
Homicide, assaults, violent crime
is down across the board.

60
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,275
If people want to be concerned,

61
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:13,374
they should focus in on characters
like this Blade criminal.

62
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:14,509
Now, that's the guy I wanna hear about.

63
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:17,350
I wanna hear about this character Blade.
What about him?

64
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,981
He's a sociopath
that we've been pursuing.

65
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:23,721
Blade is a troubled individual.

66
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:26,229
I understand that he is
under the impression

67
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:28,322
that there is a vast conspiracy
of vampires.

68
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:32,401
Now, you've got to Iook
at the psychiatric underpinnings

69
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,961
of a belief like that.

70
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:40,340
Odds are he believes
that he is out there slaying monsters.

71
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,505
- But what he's really doing...
- Mm-hmm.

72
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,837
...is trying to kill
aspects of himself.

73
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:54,720
Aah!

74
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:01,497
Aah!

75
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:04,091
Ah!

76
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,309
Aah!

77
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:24,672
I'm on the Stonebridge overpass.

78
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:26,148
Got it. Heading westbound.

79
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:28,310
I'm just beneath ya.

80
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:29,853
Go!

81
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:21,937
Aah!

82
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,785
Aah!

83
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:44,315
Come on!

84
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:47,722
I got him. Pull!

85
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:49,949
You all right, man?

86
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,107
He's got a gun!

87
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,493
Oh, my God!

88
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:38,035
Ouch.

89
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:42,746
Staked you with silver.

90
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:45,673
Why aren't you ash?

91
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:47,911
Why aren't you smarter?

92
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:51,454
Not a vampire, dumb shit!

93
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:59,053
Set your sorry ass up.

94
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:19,078
Damn.

95
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,438
Oh, Blade.

96
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:27,479
What the fuck happen tonight?

97
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,750
How should I know?

98
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,189
He was human.

99
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,322
You're gettin' reckless, Blade.

100
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:38,225
Killing vampires is clean.

101
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:42,027
They ash--don't leave
any evidence behind.

102
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:43,623
Killing humans is messy.

103
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:45,635
You better hope nobody ID'd you.

104
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,629
This worked really good.

105
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:53,971
What's this?

106
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,377
A new delivery system for your serum.

107
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:58,437
It's an effervescent inhaler.

108
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,313
Just bite down on the mouth guard.

109
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:02,477
Delivery's automatic.

110
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,145
Some friends of mine made it.

111
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,347
Friends?

112
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:09,222
Yeah.
You remember those?

113
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:10,783
It was horrible.

114
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,297
The one car crashed, and then the guy
in the coat was shooting the other guy.

115
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,697
-It looked like there was a lot of blood.
-Thank you.

116
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:18,962
That was just a taste
of the mayhem that occurred

117
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,731
during tonight's brazen shootout

118
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:23,034
that left at least four people dead.

119
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:25,006
Now, apparently, an anonymous citizen

120
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:26,873
captured the whole event on video.

121
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:28,775
Hey, Ray.
Hey, we got a lead.

122
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:30,279
let's catch a plane, Wilson.

123
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,043
It's time to take these cowboys down.

124
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:34,782
That's what I'm talkin' about.

125
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:10,151
What's he been doing?

126
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:11,882
Fuck all. Just feeding.

127
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:13,548
Been through five of them so far.

128
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:15,182
Do you think we have enough security?

129
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:18,456
We didn't capture him.
He allowed us to take him in.

130
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:19,552
You understand?

131
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:21,063
I'm gonna go in.

132
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,491
You shouldn't have woken me.

133
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:34,598
We had to.

134
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:43,709
Your blood, your sacrament,
can set us free now.

135
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:47,144
What makes you think I care?

136
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:48,514
Your people need you.

137
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:49,951
My people?

138
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:57,055
You're nothing but shadows
of your former selves.

139
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,494
Look how far you have fallen.

140
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,758
The world's changed since your time.

141
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,663
The humans have a new hunter.

142
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:06,635
Blade.

143
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,764
And you'd like me
to kill him, wouldn't you?

144
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:12,001
Yes.

145
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:40,859
Subject is heading west.

146
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:43,065
Got him.

147
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:48,335
Congratulations.
You're famous.

148
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,845
Somebody nailed us.

149
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,542
Your face is all over the papers
and television.

150
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:54,379
Media's eatin' it up.

151
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,078
- Like I care.
- Well, you should.

152
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:59,953
Something like this--
taking out a human--

153
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:02,686
as far as the rest
of the world is concerned,

154
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,955
you're public enemy number one.

155
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,964
Didn't know this was
a popularity contest.

156
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:11,665
Damn it, Blade.
Don't you see what they're doing?

157
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:14,829
They're waging
a goddamn P.R. campaign.

158
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:18,067
Now it's not just vampires
we gotta worry about,

159
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:21,339
we're gonna have to take on
the rest of the world, too.

160
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:26,246
You worry too much, old man.

161
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:28,615
That's why we're still alive, goddamn it.

162
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:32,153
I've been doing this
since before you were born, Blade.

163
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:33,952
You're like a son to me.

164
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,854
I'm sorry I got old on ya.

165
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:40,089
I see you alone,
surrounded by enemies.

166
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:42,063
And it breaks my heart.

167
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,569
We can't win this war alone.

168
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,773
Look, he just gave me the evil eye.
Come on, man.

169
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:55,277
What about that guy?!

170
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,746
Bro and prostitute, baby.

171
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,479
So what?

172
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,384
Quit fucking around.

173
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,548
I'm hungry,
and I want to eat somebody.

174
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,656
How about him?

175
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:12,457
No fatties.
They taste like Cheetos.

176
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:15,531
No, I like him.

177
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:20,868
Wait...what about that?
Shrunken apple-headed bitch.

178
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:22,599
They fucking saw us over there.

179
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:26,199
Fucking blow me, man!
Just pick one already. Jesus Christ!

180
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:28,768
Oh, got it! Got it!

181
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:30,703
Baby on board.

182
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:34,581
Oh! Looks like we got ourselves
a combo meal!

183
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:52,130
Chicky, chicky, chicky, chicky, chicky!

184
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:42,812
Oh, yeah, baby!

185
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:44,717
What's for dinner?

186
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:57,860
Aah!

187
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,692
Hey, pretty lady.

188
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,443
No! No!

189
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:11,774
No!

190
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,079
Scream if this hurts, chica.

191
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:21,990
Aah!

192
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:23,917
Fuck you?

193
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:26,758
Aah!

194
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:28,456
Garlic!

195
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,393
Scream if this hurts, chica.

196
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:37,831
Aah!

197
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:43,258
What is it?

198
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,193
What you were worried about.

199
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,921
let's go, let's go, let's go!

200
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:10,689
Shoot to kill!

201
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,594
Aah!

202
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:45,850
Move a finger and you're dead.

203
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:47,652
How's about this one?

204
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:49,123
He's got something in his hand!

205
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,591
Get out, Blade!

206
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:57,222
Shit!

207
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,907
What's going on in there?

208
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:16,418
Somebody talk to me!

209
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,512
Aah!

210
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:32,032
Hold it right there!

211
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,501
Don't shoot, don't shoot.

212
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:22,919
Rise and shine, sleepyhead.

213
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:31,158
Special Agents Ray Cumberland,
Wilson Hale, FBI.

214
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:33,753
- We've been tracking you a long time.
- Mm-hmm.

215
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:35,888
Whistler.

216
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:37,228
Dead.

217
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:40,764
Just like all your victims.

218
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,167
Say, how many people
have you killed, Blade?

219
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:46,607
Thirty? Forty? Fifty?

220
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:50,140
1 ,1 82.

221
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:53,406
But they were all familiars.

222
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:55,473
People who work with them.

223
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:59,386
Oh. And by "them,"
you mean vampires, right?

224
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:01,754
Say, so how do you kill
these bloodsuckers, tough guy?

225
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:04,760
Maybe you could give us a few pointers.
You can stake 'em, right?

226
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:07,092
What about sunlight? I mean,
they ain't feelin' sunlight, right?

227
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:08,324
What about crosses?

228
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:10,229
Do they still work, Wilson,
in this day and age?

229
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:14,031
I don't know, Ray. I mean, what if
mister homey vampire is, like, Jewish?

230
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,135
That's a good point.

231
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:20,608
What about garlic?
Does that work on Hindu vampires?

232
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:23,646
Or do you need, like, saffron
or some shit?

233
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:26,308
- That was quick.
- Thank you.

234
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:34,589
You can keep doing your song
and dance as long as you want, Blade.

235
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:36,182
It's not gonna play.

236
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:38,686
We know what you are.

237
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,525
You're a stone-cold killer.

238
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:42,258
And you're sick as fuck.

239
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,891
let's leave the diagnosis
to the professionals.

240
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:47,834
Hello, Blade.

241
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,701
My name is Dr. Vance.

242
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:53,538
I've been charged with giving you
a psychiatric evaluation.

243
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:57,872
Gentlemen, would you mind giving us
just a couple of minutes alone?

244
00:28:57,936 --> 00:28:59,745
He's all yours.

245
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:16,855
I know you must find this
very frightening...

246
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:20,502
...but I want you to know
that I'm here to help.

247
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:23,299
And in order for me to do that,

248
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:27,605
I'm gonna have to ask you
a couple of questions, okay?

249
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:32,345
You know, Blade--
the darndest thing.

250
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:37,375
I was signing in at security,
and, uh, couldn't remember the date.

251
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,480
Do you know what day it is?

252
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:49,189
How about the President?
You know who that is.

253
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:51,291
Who's in the White House right now?

254
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:53,336
An asshole.

255
00:29:56,661 --> 00:30:00,006
I think somebody here
wants to talk about vampires.

256
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,902
Vampires.

257
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:09,345
For everyone else,
it's kind of silly.

258
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:14,715
I had a set of wax teeth
when I was seven years old.

259
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:18,222
It was fun.

260
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:21,224
I could be somebody else.

261
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:25,559
But I want to hear you
talk about vampires.

262
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:28,567
What can you tell me about them?

263
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,502
They exist.

264
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:35,242
Are you one of them?

265
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:42,378
Sometimes...
the scariest monster of all...

266
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:45,948
...is the one in the mirror.

267
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:52,594
Tell me about blood.

268
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:54,630
When you drink blood,

269
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,633
do you ever feel sexually aroused?

270
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:06,102
Just strikes me
that this business of vampirism

271
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:12,171
has a very strong element
of sexual confusion.

272
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,310
Nuzzling into someone's neck.

273
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:19,516
A nocturnal visit.

274
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:25,025
It promises a...
delicious physical intimacy.

275
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:32,226
The very sweet taste of saliva...

276
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,860
mixed with skin.

277
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:38,000
Sounds good to me.

278
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:41,140
Where's it come from?

279
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:42,837
That's what I wanna know.

280
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:49,215
And I'm starting to wonder what your
relationship with your mother was like.

281
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:53,553
Were the two of you very close?

282
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,360
He's psychotic.

283
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,422
No shit.

284
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:05,695
For his safety and for the publics,

285
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,067
I'm recommending that he be transferred
immediately to County Psychiatric--

286
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:09,901
Fuck that!
That man is my prisoner.

287
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:12,202
He's wanted in connection
with a laundry list of federal crimes.

288
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,539
Hold on, gentlemen.
We're in my jurisdiction now.

289
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:17,045
You got a problem with that,
you talk to the local magistrate.

290
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,012
- That man is my prisoner!
- The call has already been made.

291
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,310
Don't fuck with my thing!

292
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:23,113
There's a team from the hospital
effecting the transfer immediately.

293
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:25,120
You're supposed to be
working with us on this, Chief.

294
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:26,177
Not this time.

295
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:35,361
This is just a little something
to keep you compliant.

296
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:40,462
The usual dose for this sort of thing
is two, three hundred milligrams,

297
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:45,565
but I think with a big,
strapping hybrid like yourself,

298
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,167
I'll kick it up to a couple thousand.

299
00:32:48,232 --> 00:32:50,678
You don't have a problem
with needles, do ya?

300
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:54,547
There.

301
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:56,016
That wasn't so bad, was it?

302
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:00,120
Ooh, you're weak.

303
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:02,722
In need of your serum.

304
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:05,452
That must be a bad feeling.

305
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,424
I mean, who would've imagined

306
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:12,559
that a mere human like me
could overpower you.

307
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:17,296
You're one of them.

308
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:20,302
A familiar.

309
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:26,408
Going on five years now.

310
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:32,111
It's the endgame, Blade.

311
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:35,213
All their plans are coming to fruition.

312
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:39,861
Why don't you just sit back
and enjoy the show?

313
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:51,038
I hate familiars.

314
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:03,415
It's why we're still alive, goddammit.

315
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:05,984
You're like a son to me.

316
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:12,558
Sorry l got old on ya.

317
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:18,131
l see you alone,
surrounded by enemies.

318
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:20,169
It breaks my heart.

319
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,725
Hi, Blade.

320
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:49,594
So glad to finally meet you.

321
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:51,634
I am such a fan.

322
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:54,996
I like your tattoos.

323
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:57,463
Do they mean anything?

324
00:34:58,629 --> 00:34:59,869
Stupid.

325
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:02,205
Are you okay?

326
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,973
Are you tired?

327
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:07,072
You're weak.

328
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:14,455
We moved the humans around.

329
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:16,717
Like pawns.

330
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:19,294
We used them...

331
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:21,688
...to flush you out.

332
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:32,371
You're not so big.

333
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:36,443
You're all alone, Blade.

334
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:39,574
No one's gonna help you now.

335
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:03,238
- Evening, ladies.
- Hannibal King!

336
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:08,710
Wake up, Blade.
This is your rescue.

337
00:36:57,348 --> 00:36:58,418
Go!

338
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,238
Freeze!

339
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:02,551
Whistler!

340
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:05,092
This way!

341
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:14,836
Blade!

342
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:16,371
You're dead!

343
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:18,266
Get down!

344
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:26,706
Blade.

345
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,586
Hey, hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

346
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:36,681
Where are you going?

347
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:38,420
Where the fuck is he going?

348
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:40,723
This is supposed to be a rescue!

349
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:48,095
Get back, get back!

350
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:52,332
We're pinned down.

351
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:53,534
I can't shoot around corners.

352
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:54,667
l can.

353
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,483
Aah!

354
00:39:58,028 --> 00:40:00,304
Okay. We're fucked.

355
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:01,502
We're fine.

356
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:17,383
Forgot my sword.

357
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:27,898
Whoo! Come on!

358
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:43,850
Abby.

359
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,283
Aah!

360
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:51,988
We got him.

361
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:53,687
We'll be there soon.

362
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:55,492
Who the hell are you people?

363
00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:58,397
Well, my name is Hannibal King.

364
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,800
And this little hellion
right here is Abigail.

365
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:02,702
Whistler's daughter.

366
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:17,946
I thought the vampires
killed Whistler's family.

367
00:41:18,008 --> 00:41:21,581
They did.
I was born later out of wedlock.

368
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,888
When I came of age,
I tracked my dad down,

369
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,361
and I told him I wanted in.

370
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:29,921
Been doing it ever since.

371
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:38,698
Welcome to the honeycomb hideout.

372
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:41,799
How do you bankroll this operation?

373
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:43,345
I date a lot of older men.

374
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:46,737
Come on, man, I'm joking.

375
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:48,511
You met Dex.

376
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:49,915
This is Hedges.

377
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:52,853
Sommerfield--she's the one who built
that new serum inhaler of yours.

378
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:58,053
That runt you saw earlier,
that was Sommerfield's daughter Zoe.

379
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:01,959
We call ourselves the Nightstalkers.

380
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:06,099
Hmm. Sounds like rejects
from a Saturday morning cartoon.

381
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:09,968
We were gonna go with
the Care Bears, but, uh, that was taken.

382
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:14,703
How many of you are there?

383
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:15,903
There's enough.

384
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:17,639
We operate in sleeper cells.

385
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:20,147
When one goes down, another cell
activates to pick up the slack.

386
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:23,014
Consider us your reinforcements.

387
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:26,788
What, you amateurs
are supposed to be helping me?

388
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:30,390
You?

389
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:32,825
Look at you.

390
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,157
You're kids.

391
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:36,555
You're not ready to roll with this.

392
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:39,134
I mean, Iook at the way you're dressed.

393
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,965
What, that's supposed to be tactical?

394
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:45,000
What is this? What is that?
"Fuck you."

395
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,507
It's a joke, huh?

396
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,609
What the fuck is wrong with y'all?
Y'all think this is a joke?

397
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:52,341
You think this is a fucking sitcom?

398
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:55,407
Okay, first off, that's just rude.

399
00:42:55,472 --> 00:42:59,352
Second, I'm pretty sure
we saved your ass back there.

400
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:03,620
I'm impressed.

401
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:06,855
Look, Blade, my father meant
for us to help you.

402
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,864
Like it or not, we are all you got.

403
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,163
What the hell makes you think
you know about hunting vampires?

404
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:16,966
Well, here's for starters.

405
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:19,139
I used to be one.

406
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:21,976
Do I pass the audition?

407
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:25,178
Rookies.

408
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:28,382
Fucking Hannibal King!

409
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:32,148
I should've ripped his bleeding heart
out when I had the chance!

410
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:34,853
Ugh!

411
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:37,991
Ugh!

412
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:41,692
We had Blade.

413
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:43,129
We had him!

414
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:44,495
Ugh!

415
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:48,069
And don't tell me "I told you so," Asher.

416
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,071
What's wrong, half pint?
You need a time out?

417
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,299
Blow me.

418
00:43:52,696 --> 00:43:54,937
We got caught with our pants down.

419
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:56,376
Pants down?

420
00:43:56,433 --> 00:43:59,607
They pretty much
fucking ass-raped us.

421
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:01,115
Oh, you loved it.

422
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:02,809
Has he been told?

423
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,486
About your failure?

424
00:44:06,677 --> 00:44:07,712
Yes.

425
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:11,719
Maybe it's time I joined the game.

426
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:21,967
You know the kind of woman
that just screams trouble?

427
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:25,731
You see her and every warning bell
in your brain starts going off,

428
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:29,869
but you still manage to ask
for her number.

429
00:44:29,933 --> 00:44:31,913
Well, that's all I ever hook up with.

430
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:33,744
But this Betty...

431
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:39,018
Whoa! She blew 'em all away
in the shit storm sweepstakes.

432
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,251
Her name is Danica Talos.

433
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:42,915
You met her earlier.

434
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:46,484
And unlike typical vampires,
her fangs are located in her vagina.

435
00:44:49,253 --> 00:44:50,823
Moving on.

436
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:53,835
The man on her left
is her brother Asher,

437
00:44:53,891 --> 00:44:57,464
and this walking diaper stain
is Jarko Grimwood.

438
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,166
I picked Danica up in a bar

439
00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:01,470
and spent the next five years
playing hide-and-go-suck

440
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:04,012
as her little vampire cabana boy.

441
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:06,571
Eventually, Abigail found me.

442
00:45:06,637 --> 00:45:10,278
Sommerfield managed to treat me
with a cure, and now I kill them.

443
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:14,721
And that's basically
turning a frown upside-down.

444
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,788
We need to pool our resources, Blade.

445
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:20,788
"We"?

446
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:24,161
Yeah, we.

447
00:45:24,955 --> 00:45:26,832
He's come back.

448
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:30,838
Take a Iook at this.

449
00:45:35,999 --> 00:45:37,410
You gotta be kidding me.

450
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:46,184
Where'd you guys get this stuff?

451
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:49,656
I stole most of it.
Danica had a huge collection.

452
00:45:49,713 --> 00:45:54,719
You got stonework, ironwork,
weaponry, art.

453
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:58,857
It's this stuff that shows up everywhere.
This symbol, this glyph--

454
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:00,060
It's on everything in here.

455
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:03,469
He is real.
You dig beneath all the--the myths,

456
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:07,669
all the layers of bullshit that have cluttered
our culture for the last 500 years,

457
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:10,041
and eventually
you're gonna strike the truth.

458
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:12,947
So the movies are true.

459
00:46:13,003 --> 00:46:17,349
The movies are just a comforting
fairy tale compared to the real deal.

460
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:19,182
Bram Stoker--he wrote a good yarn,

461
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:22,417
but the events that he described
back in 1 897--

462
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:25,050
God. That was just a tiny piece
of the mosaic.

463
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:30,827
The real Dracula--his origins
date back much, much earlier than that.

464
00:46:30,888 --> 00:46:32,162
How early?

465
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:34,361
Try six or seven thousand years.

466
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:36,532
This is a piece of his armor.

467
00:46:36,593 --> 00:46:40,097
With it, we were able to extrapolate a
basic idea of what this fucker Iooked like.

468
00:46:40,164 --> 00:46:41,404
Check this out.

469
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:45,070
Dracula's only one
of the names he's gone by.

470
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:49,447
The Babylonians worshipped him
as Dagon, and now they call him Drake.

471
00:46:49,506 --> 00:46:52,885
If you believe in the legends,
he was born in ancient Sumeria.

472
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:05,433
Nobody really knows the specifics
of his origin, but we do know this.

473
00:47:09,526 --> 00:47:10,971
He was the first of his kind.

474
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:15,636
The patriarch of hominus nocturna.

475
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:23,518
He was born perfect.

476
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:31,448
And just like the great white shark,
this guy has never had to evolve.

477
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:33,653
Forget the movies, forget the books.

478
00:47:33,717 --> 00:47:35,424
There's no happy ending with this guy.

479
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:40,194
He's been there,
moving behind the scenes,

480
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:44,728
cutting a bloody fucking path
through the ages, until suddenly...

481
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:48,302
...just like that...

482
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:54,312
...he up and disappeared.

483
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:56,044
And then we heard a rumor.

484
00:47:56,106 --> 00:47:58,279
The vampires were searching for him.

485
00:47:58,342 --> 00:48:00,788
Some say he'd been sleeping
through the ages,

486
00:48:00,844 --> 00:48:03,950
that he'd retreated from a world
he'd become disgusted with.

487
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:08,224
And according to our information, they
found him in Iraq about six months ago.

488
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:10,094
And he was pissed.

489
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:38,289
Don't try to use my name,
that's fatal.

490
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:41,056
Tried to claim my fame,
but that's fatal.

491
00:48:41,118 --> 00:48:44,258
About to raise the pain,
that's fatal.

492
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:47,268
Tried to claim my fame,
but that's fatal.

493
00:48:47,324 --> 00:48:50,168
About to raise the pain,
that's fatal.

494
00:48:50,227 --> 00:48:53,731
Bite through your jugular vein,
that's fatal.

495
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:09,486
In the window...

496
00:49:09,546 --> 00:49:11,924
You sell vampire merchandise?

497
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:15,457
Uh, yeah.

498
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,964
Look around.

499
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:18,658
We might have a few things.

500
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,298
We've got Dracula lunch boxes.

501
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:24,737
Did you see those?

502
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:28,402
There's bobble heads, key chains.

503
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:29,535
This is funny.

504
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:37,213
That garlic gets me every time.

505
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:40,917
We've got just about anything.

506
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:43,822
Even vampire vibrators.

507
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:47,790
Here. Check this out.

508
00:49:50,587 --> 00:49:51,964
Dra-cola.

509
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:54,562
Makes you want to cry, doesn't it?

510
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:05,678
Was there something special
you needed?

511
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:08,642
Hey, guy.

512
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:11,008
She's talkin' to ya.

513
00:50:18,715 --> 00:50:20,285
What?

514
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,296
You wanna kiss me, pretty boy?

515
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,832
Aah!

516
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:26,026
No!

517
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:28,228
Tried to claim my fame,
but that's fatal.

518
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:31,568
About to raise the pain,
that's fatal.

519
00:50:31,628 --> 00:50:33,869
Bite through your jugular vein,
that's fatal.

520
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:35,530
Aah!

521
00:50:39,236 --> 00:50:42,513
Aah!

522
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:53,259
Bite through your jugular vein,
that's fatal

523
00:50:53,984 --> 00:50:55,054
Why wake up Drake now?

524
00:50:55,118 --> 00:50:57,223
That's exactly what we've been
trying to figure out.

525
00:50:57,287 --> 00:50:58,630
When I was under the fang,

526
00:50:58,688 --> 00:51:02,693
there used to be talk about
some kind of vampire final solution.

527
00:51:02,759 --> 00:51:04,761
But I could never figure out why
they'd want to destroy their food source.

528
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:06,774
I mean, that makes no sense, right?

529
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:08,468
They've always had plans
for the human race,

530
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:11,012
and it seems likely
that whatever they're cooking up,

531
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:12,877
Drake's return is part of it.

532
00:51:12,936 --> 00:51:13,937
let's face it.

533
00:51:14,004 --> 00:51:16,109
We are fighting a losing battle here.

534
00:51:16,173 --> 00:51:18,710
So we kill a few hundred
of them a year--big deal.

535
00:51:18,775 --> 00:51:21,779
There are thousands of them out there,
maybe tens of thousands.

536
00:51:21,845 --> 00:51:23,051
We need a new tactic.

537
00:51:23,113 --> 00:51:24,319
Like what?

538
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:25,883
A biological weapon.

539
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:29,053
For you sighted people...

540
00:51:31,688 --> 00:51:33,793
...here's a little show and tell.

541
00:51:33,857 --> 00:51:36,394
For the last year,
I've been working with synthesized DNA

542
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:40,465
in order to create an artificial virus
targeted specifically at vampires.

543
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:42,635
We're calling it Day Star.

544
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:44,269
Think about it, Blade.

545
00:51:44,968 --> 00:51:47,539
We could wipe 'em all out
in one single move.

546
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:49,311
So what's been holding you back?

547
00:51:49,372 --> 00:51:51,750
The lethality in vampires is still spotty.

548
00:51:51,808 --> 00:51:54,948
The bottom line is we need
a better strand of DNA to work with.

549
00:51:55,812 --> 00:51:57,849
We need Dracula's blood.

550
00:51:57,914 --> 00:52:00,520
Because Dracula is the progenitor
of the vampire race,

551
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:02,996
his DNA is still pure.

552
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:07,695
It hasn't been diluted by a hundred
generations of selective mutation.

553
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:13,571
We get his blood, we can boost
Day Star's viral efficacy to 100%.

554
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,803
All the vampires go bye-bye.

555
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,981
So, can we just
go right ahead and sign you up

556
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:22,312
for one of our secret
Nightstalker decoder rings?

557
00:52:28,178 --> 00:52:29,248
Oh.

558
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:30,689
Holy shit.

559
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:33,489
Um, gentlemen and hottie,

560
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:36,394
uh, we have a wide assortment
of ass-kickery

561
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:38,455
for your viewing pleasure today.

562
00:52:38,522 --> 00:52:42,265
Electronic pistol--comes in a variety
of tasty calibers.

563
00:52:43,226 --> 00:52:44,671
Explosive rounds.

564
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:46,901
Yeah, but with
a concentrated burst of UV light

565
00:52:46,963 --> 00:52:48,943
instead of your standard hollow points.

566
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,740
I call 'em sun dogs.

567
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,009
Hedges. Super-size me, sweetheart.

568
00:52:56,473 --> 00:52:58,885
This little pea shooter--
it's a modified version

569
00:52:58,942 --> 00:53:01,684
of the Army's objective
individual combat weapon.

570
00:53:01,745 --> 00:53:03,486
Pick your poison--sun dogs, stakes,

571
00:53:03,547 --> 00:53:05,083
heat-seeking mini rockets.

572
00:53:05,148 --> 00:53:08,493
Basically, whatever gets you hard,
this puppy'll pump 'em out.

573
00:53:08,552 --> 00:53:11,533
Course, it doesn't have
the range of a sword, but...

574
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:14,327
Oh, God.

575
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:16,803
Over here, we, um--

576
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:20,569
we call this the UV Arc.

577
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:22,803
Whoa. Sorry.

578
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:25,745
The two points are connected
by a powerful UV laser--

579
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:27,839
- Hedges, I'll take it from here.
- Yes.

580
00:53:29,406 --> 00:53:31,079
This bad boy is half as hot as the sun.

581
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:34,486
It can cut through vampires
like a knife through butter.

582
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:37,889
We're still trying to sort out fact
from fiction when it comes to Dracula.

583
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:40,292
Turning into mist?
Kinda doubt it.

584
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:43,854
General shape-shifting?
Maybe.

585
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:47,160
Not into a bat or a wolf
or anything like that,

586
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:51,172
but another human,
with practice, could be possible.

587
00:53:52,028 --> 00:53:54,702
Because he wouldn't have
a traditional skeletal structure.

588
00:53:54,764 --> 00:53:58,041
Something more like a snake's,
with thousands of tiny bones--

589
00:53:58,101 --> 00:54:01,605
I have a--I have a question
about that, Hedges.

590
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:03,514
Have you ever been laid?

591
00:54:04,307 --> 00:54:06,082
Many times.

592
00:54:06,142 --> 00:54:07,246
With ladies.

593
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:10,715
Time for a little pressure.

594
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:14,122
The weakest link
in the vampire chain of command

595
00:54:14,184 --> 00:54:16,255
has always been their familiars.

596
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,595
Since the vampires can't go out
in the daylight,

597
00:54:18,655 --> 00:54:21,499
they get the humans to do
all their dirty work.

598
00:54:21,558 --> 00:54:23,435
We bleed the wannabes...

599
00:54:24,127 --> 00:54:26,368
Sooner or later,
they'll take us right to the real.

600
00:54:26,997 --> 00:54:28,670
I got you some new wheels.

601
00:54:28,732 --> 00:54:30,177
You take care of it now.

602
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:38,617
She's making playlists.

603
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:41,547
She likes to listen to MP3s
when she hunts.

604
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:44,023
It's like her own
internal soundtrack, you know?

605
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:48,119
Dark core, trip hop, whatever
kids are listening to these days.

606
00:54:48,818 --> 00:54:51,662
Me, I'm more of
a David Hasselhoff fan, you know?

607
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:55,766
Come on, come on like that, ya'll.

608
00:54:57,761 --> 00:54:59,900
Come on, come on,
like that, y'all.

609
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:02,944
Let me see you say ho.

610
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:26,827
Let me see you say ho.

611
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:35,641
Aah!

612
00:55:39,636 --> 00:55:41,445
Ah! Aah!

613
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:49,747
Eventually, you know,
your head is gonna pop off.

614
00:55:49,813 --> 00:55:52,123
Fuck! No, no!
Please, please! Please.

615
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:53,422
Who's your handler?

616
00:55:53,483 --> 00:55:55,053
I don't know my fucking handler.

617
00:55:55,118 --> 00:55:56,859
I swear. I swear!

618
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,161
Oh, shit! Please! Please!

619
00:56:03,927 --> 00:56:05,463
Oh, it's you.

620
00:56:06,162 --> 00:56:07,266
I'll take that.

621
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:09,099
Come on!

622
00:56:09,165 --> 00:56:10,667
let's go! Come on!

623
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:15,941
Hello?

624
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:17,143
Hello?

625
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:21,188
Hello, this is Dr. Vance.
You paged me.

626
00:56:22,612 --> 00:56:23,613
It's for you.

627
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,057
Yeah, go ahead.

628
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:27,321
Hello?

629
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:29,762
Aah!

630
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:32,294
You know, at some point, you, uh,

631
00:56:32,355 --> 00:56:34,733
you might want to consider
sitting down with somebody.

632
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:36,771
You know? Have a little share time?

633
00:56:36,826 --> 00:56:39,170
Kick back?
Get in touch with your inner child?

634
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,264
That sort of thing?

635
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:44,836
Also--just a thought--but you might
wanna consider blinking once in a while.

636
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:53,878
I'm sorry, I, uh,
I ate a lot of sugar today.

637
00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:12,195
Hey.

638
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,538
You just can't walk in here like--aah!

639
00:57:22,305 --> 00:57:23,511
Excuse me, sir.

640
00:57:30,713 --> 00:57:31,953
Don't do that.

641
00:57:49,766 --> 00:57:50,767
Where's Vance?

642
00:57:50,834 --> 00:57:52,939
I'm sorry, but you can't see
Dr. Vance right now.

643
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:03,283
Sit.

644
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:09,494
Can I, uh, can I help you?

645
00:58:09,552 --> 00:58:11,691
Remember me?
Time for payback.

646
00:58:11,754 --> 00:58:14,098
All right, Vance,
what the hell do you know?

647
00:58:16,759 --> 00:58:17,829
Oh, Jesus.

648
00:58:17,894 --> 00:58:19,100
It's him.

649
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:20,903
Abby. It's Drake!

650
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:29,243
Aah!

651
00:58:36,479 --> 00:58:39,119
So, you're the hunter they all fear.

652
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:40,718
I had a feeling about you.

653
00:58:40,783 --> 00:58:41,989
Just shoot him!

654
00:58:42,051 --> 00:58:43,689
Go ahead, Blade.

655
00:58:43,753 --> 00:58:45,096
Show me what you're made of.

656
00:58:45,154 --> 00:58:46,224
Aah!

657
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:18,115
Aah! Oh, my God!

658
01:00:18,181 --> 01:00:20,320
He got my baby!

659
01:00:20,383 --> 01:00:23,227
Aah! No! My baby!

660
01:01:22,645 --> 01:01:24,921
Ah, careful, Daywalker.

661
01:01:24,981 --> 01:01:26,961
I've been told about you.

662
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:29,087
Your weakness for humans.

663
01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:30,722
Why'd you kill Vance?

664
01:01:30,787 --> 01:01:33,063
He'd outlived his purpose.

665
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:34,693
He died a good death.

666
01:01:34,991 --> 01:01:36,732
Quick, clean.

667
01:01:36,793 --> 01:01:38,795
I wouldn't know anything about that.

668
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:40,204
You will.

669
01:01:42,065 --> 01:01:44,671
How are you able to survive in sunlight?

670
01:01:44,734 --> 01:01:47,010
Haven't you read Stoker's fable?

671
01:01:48,004 --> 01:01:50,746
I was the first of the vampires.

672
01:01:52,175 --> 01:01:53,950
I am unique.

673
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:55,546
So that's why they brought you back.

674
01:01:55,611 --> 01:01:56,954
Of course.

675
01:01:57,013 --> 01:02:00,119
They believe through me
they could become Daywalkers.

676
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,125
Look at them down there.

677
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:10,034
Scurrying around like insects.

678
01:02:10,626 --> 01:02:14,267
They don't know anything about honor
or living by the sword,

679
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:15,968
not like you and I do.

680
01:02:16,499 --> 01:02:20,003
Do you think they could ever grasp
what it means to be immortal?

681
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:21,377
You're not immortal.

682
01:02:22,138 --> 01:02:25,779
I must've heard hundreds of you rodents
make the same claim.

683
01:02:26,442 --> 01:02:29,321
Each one of them have tasted
the end of my sword.

684
01:02:29,378 --> 01:02:31,358
Perhaps I will too, then,

685
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:35,055
but I think it is more likely
the next time we meet,

686
01:02:35,118 --> 01:02:37,462
you fall before mine.

687
01:02:38,287 --> 01:02:39,527
Catch!

688
01:02:58,341 --> 01:02:59,820
Cootchie coo.

689
01:03:01,744 --> 01:03:02,848
Did you see that guy?

690
01:03:02,912 --> 01:03:04,482
We're gonna lose, man.
We're gonna--

691
01:03:04,547 --> 01:03:06,788
Oh! God!

692
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:08,795
We're gonna fucking lose!

693
01:03:10,253 --> 01:03:13,427
What did the one lesbian vampire
say to the other?

694
01:03:13,489 --> 01:03:14,991
Shut up, King.

695
01:03:15,057 --> 01:03:17,059
See you in 28 days.

696
01:03:18,728 --> 01:03:19,798
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on.

697
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:21,600
What are you--what is that?
What are you doing?

698
01:03:21,664 --> 01:03:23,166
It's an elastic protein, okay?

699
01:03:23,232 --> 01:03:24,677
It's gonna stop the hemorrhaging.

700
01:03:24,734 --> 01:03:25,872
Okay.

701
01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:27,073
Is it gonna hurt?

702
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:28,979
Yeah, it's gonna sting a little.

703
01:03:29,038 --> 01:03:30,483
Really?

704
01:03:32,775 --> 01:03:34,812
Fuck me!

705
01:03:34,877 --> 01:03:36,049
Aah!

706
01:03:39,882 --> 01:03:41,725
l had a family once.

707
01:03:42,451 --> 01:03:44,829
Wife, two daughters.

708
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:51,764
Then a drifter came calling
one evening.

709
01:03:53,095 --> 01:03:54,369
A vampire.

710
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:57,941
He toyed with 'em first.

711
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:03,817
Tried to make me decide
which order they'd die in.

712
01:04:05,141 --> 01:04:07,382
I've been doing this along time.

713
01:04:07,443 --> 01:04:09,684
Since before you were born.

714
01:04:10,813 --> 01:04:13,225
l don't want this life for you, Abby.

715
01:04:56,025 --> 01:04:57,333
Hey, Blade.

716
01:04:57,393 --> 01:05:00,101
I got a question for you.

717
01:05:00,162 --> 01:05:02,768
Say we're successful.
Say we wipe out all the vampires.

718
01:05:02,832 --> 01:05:04,402
What then, huh?

719
01:05:05,134 --> 01:05:07,045
You ever ask yourself that?

720
01:05:08,137 --> 01:05:09,275
I mean, somehow,

721
01:05:09,338 --> 01:05:14,651
I--I don't picture you teaching karate
at the local Y.

722
01:05:25,388 --> 01:05:27,026
He hates me, doesn't he?

723
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:28,397
Yeah.

724
01:05:39,001 --> 01:05:41,003
Why do you wear that symbol?

725
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:46,878
Old habits.

726
01:05:49,879 --> 01:05:52,553
I was a good Catholic schoolgirl...

727
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:55,585
...once.

728
01:05:55,651 --> 01:05:57,722
I was there when they crucified him.

729
01:06:00,089 --> 01:06:02,091
He died for their sins.

730
01:06:03,426 --> 01:06:04,700
Not mine.

731
01:06:06,162 --> 01:06:08,164
And what are your sins?

732
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,773
Would you care to confess them?

733
01:06:17,873 --> 01:06:19,113
Take it off.

734
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:22,621
Why?

735
01:06:23,212 --> 01:06:25,089
I will make you a better one.

736
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:53,183
There's an old saying.

737
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:59,455
Kill one man, you're a murderer...

738
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:03,459
...kill a million, a king.

739
01:07:05,388 --> 01:07:06,867
Kill 'em all...

740
01:07:08,124 --> 01:07:09,626
...a god.

741
01:07:35,584 --> 01:07:36,995
Why do you do that?

742
01:07:37,787 --> 01:07:42,065
Because there's something bad
inside of me.

743
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:45,561
This keeps it from getting out.

744
01:07:45,628 --> 01:07:47,733
Why can't you just be nice?

745
01:07:53,335 --> 01:07:55,679
Because the world isn't nice.

746
01:08:01,444 --> 01:08:02,946
I found where the vampires are working.

747
01:08:03,279 --> 01:08:05,452
Biomedica Enterprises.

748
01:08:05,514 --> 01:08:08,324
They've been buying up
all sorts of supplies.

749
01:08:08,384 --> 01:08:09,954
Check it out.

750
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,661
Taq polymerase,

751
01:08:12,721 --> 01:08:15,600
bone marrow growth supplement,

752
01:08:15,658 --> 01:08:18,662
genetic sequencing enzymes.

753
01:08:19,829 --> 01:08:21,433
You want a party favor?

754
01:08:21,497 --> 01:08:23,033
Lucky seven.

755
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:24,737
Silver hollow points.

756
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,279
Done.

757
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:57,106
You wanted to see me?

758
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:59,344
We've got trouble.

759
01:08:59,869 --> 01:09:02,145
Doing a little moonlighting, Chief?

760
01:09:02,204 --> 01:09:03,649
Shit!

761
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:16,853
What are you doing here?

762
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:18,421
Talk.

763
01:09:20,089 --> 01:09:21,159
Talk.

764
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:26,237
Spill it!

765
01:09:26,295 --> 01:09:27,535
You know what we're doing.

766
01:09:28,264 --> 01:09:29,675
What's inside?

767
01:09:31,066 --> 01:09:33,068
Aah!

768
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:40,181
Now, what's behind door number one?

769
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:44,249
I can't tell you.
They--they'll kill me.

770
01:09:44,313 --> 01:09:46,418
Kill you?
Motherfucker, l'll kill you.

771
01:09:46,482 --> 01:09:48,052
I'll just enjoy it better.

772
01:09:56,392 --> 01:09:57,894
You know the routine.

773
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:16,050
Lights.

774
01:10:19,248 --> 01:10:20,386
God in Heaven.

775
01:10:36,265 --> 01:10:37,972
What is this place?

776
01:10:38,934 --> 01:10:40,971
It's a blood farming facility.

777
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:51,218
Vampires decided that hunting humans
on a piecemeal basis was...

778
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:52,623
too inefficient.

779
01:10:53,616 --> 01:10:56,563
Why kill your prey
when you can keep them alive?

780
01:10:59,788 --> 01:11:01,768
Under optimal conditions,
a donor can generate

781
01:11:01,824 --> 01:11:04,634
anywhere from 50 to 1 00
pints of blood.

782
01:11:05,227 --> 01:11:06,900
Productive.

783
01:11:08,631 --> 01:11:10,269
Where do you get all these people?

784
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:14,779
They got processing centers
in every major city.

785
01:11:14,837 --> 01:11:17,044
At any given time, there's what,

786
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:20,849
two, three million homeless
wandering around America?

787
01:11:20,909 --> 01:11:22,820
They just pull 'em in off the streets.

788
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:26,589
Nobody cares about them.

789
01:11:27,716 --> 01:11:30,196
We're doing this country
a service, really.

790
01:11:33,055 --> 01:11:35,331
Vampire final solution.

791
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:38,363
Are they aware?

792
01:11:38,427 --> 01:11:40,407
Do they feel anything?

793
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:43,371
They're in a chemical-induced coma.

794
01:11:43,432 --> 01:11:44,934
They're brain dead.

795
01:11:48,737 --> 01:11:50,182
Look at this.

796
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:52,547
This the future you want?

797
01:11:52,608 --> 01:11:57,023
Don't you think that they have
a place for you in their future?

798
01:11:57,713 --> 01:11:59,351
We don't have a choice!

799
01:12:00,349 --> 01:12:02,852
They're going to win.
Can't you see that?

800
01:12:03,385 --> 01:12:04,591
He's come back!

801
01:12:04,653 --> 01:12:06,929
There's nothing stopping them now.

802
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:08,525
There's me.

803
01:12:09,692 --> 01:12:10,898
Go!

804
01:12:12,127 --> 01:12:14,368
You got 20 seconds.

805
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:18,610
Twenty.

806
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:27,450
Shutdown password--what is it?

807
01:12:27,509 --> 01:12:29,284
Harvest.

808
01:12:30,412 --> 01:12:31,413
Put it in.

809
01:12:47,429 --> 01:12:48,567
let's go.

810
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:04,023
Where'd you go?
See? I turned my back on you.

811
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:06,787
- Oh! You win.
- One more, one more.

812
01:13:06,849 --> 01:13:10,626
"Now, Nome King,
having never tried to be good,

813
01:13:10,686 --> 01:13:13,428
was very bad indeed."

814
01:13:14,523 --> 01:13:17,367
"Having decided to conquer
the land of Oz

815
01:13:17,426 --> 01:13:21,101
and to destroy the Emerald City..."

816
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:29,473
This ain't no video game.

817
01:13:29,638 --> 01:13:30,981
This ain't no video game.

818
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:36,080
Come on, now.

819
01:14:02,471 --> 01:14:05,509
Dude, you're dead.

820
01:14:13,081 --> 01:14:15,425
Mom, the lights are weird.

821
01:14:16,952 --> 01:14:18,295
What do you mean?

822
01:14:18,353 --> 01:14:19,855
They're going on and off.

823
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:24,999
Guys?

824
01:14:26,428 --> 01:14:29,602
Zoe, I want you to go,
and I want you to hide, okay?

825
01:14:29,665 --> 01:14:32,236
Like we talked about. Go on.

826
01:15:09,204 --> 01:15:10,649
Zoe?

827
01:15:11,473 --> 01:15:13,475
Get out of here, Zoe!

828
01:15:14,109 --> 01:15:15,110
Hide!

829
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:16,952
Goddamn it, Zoe!

830
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:20,793
Goddamn it!

831
01:17:06,288 --> 01:17:10,930
Aah!

832
01:17:47,195 --> 01:17:48,265
Aah!

833
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:51,209
Aah!

834
01:17:51,266 --> 01:17:52,472
Aah!

835
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:10,725
Something's not right.

836
01:18:16,024 --> 01:18:17,264
King!

837
01:19:24,292 --> 01:19:24,997
Zoe?

838
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:08,304
Zoe.

839
01:20:09,271 --> 01:20:10,875
Zoe?

840
01:20:13,108 --> 01:20:14,280
Whistler.

841
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:32,156
Use it.

842
01:21:34,556 --> 01:21:35,933
Use it.

843
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:42,068
Use it.

844
01:21:46,835 --> 01:21:49,714
Aah!

845
01:22:03,051 --> 01:22:04,689
Back off, pooch.

846
01:22:08,356 --> 01:22:10,768
Jesus Christ!

847
01:22:12,227 --> 01:22:13,831
What the fuck?!

848
01:22:13,895 --> 01:22:15,203
Good dog.

849
01:22:15,263 --> 01:22:17,834
What the fuck?!

850
01:22:21,036 --> 01:22:22,242
His name's Pac-Man.

851
01:22:23,338 --> 01:22:27,252
We've been porting the vampire gene
into other species--experimenting.

852
01:22:27,309 --> 01:22:31,314
You made a goddamn
vampire Pomeranian?

853
01:22:32,681 --> 01:22:33,887
Yeah.

854
01:22:39,921 --> 01:22:41,491
Precious, isn't he?

855
01:22:41,556 --> 01:22:43,763
Well, that depends who you ask,
because clearly,

856
01:22:43,825 --> 01:22:45,862
this dog has a bigger dick than you.

857
01:22:46,962 --> 01:22:51,035
And when the fuck
did you see my dick, fuckface?

858
01:22:52,267 --> 01:22:53,940
Ow!

859
01:22:54,002 --> 01:22:56,573
I was talking to her!

860
01:23:00,308 --> 01:23:02,185
Poor King.

861
01:23:03,078 --> 01:23:06,355
You Iook so distraught!

862
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:12,131
Give me that chair.

863
01:23:22,097 --> 01:23:24,304
You're tasting a little bland, lover.

864
01:23:24,366 --> 01:23:27,347
Are you getting enough
fatty acids in your diet?

865
01:23:27,402 --> 01:23:30,383
Have you tried lake trout?

866
01:23:30,438 --> 01:23:32,179
Mackerel?

867
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:35,585
How about you take
a sugar-frosted fuck

868
01:23:35,643 --> 01:23:37,748
off the end of my dick?

869
01:23:37,812 --> 01:23:42,886
And how about everyone here
not saying the word "dick" anymore?

870
01:23:42,951 --> 01:23:45,693
It provokes my envy.

871
01:23:53,461 --> 01:23:55,407
Tell us about Blade, King.

872
01:23:55,463 --> 01:23:58,137
What's this weapon
he's been planning?

873
01:23:58,767 --> 01:24:00,769
I can tell you two things.

874
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:08,377
One...your hairdo is ridiculous.

875
01:24:09,444 --> 01:24:14,689
Two, I ate a lot of garlic,
and I just farted.

876
01:24:14,749 --> 01:24:16,285
Silent but deadly.

877
01:24:17,752 --> 01:24:20,130
Spit it out, you fucking fruitcake!

878
01:24:20,188 --> 01:24:21,223
All right! Fuck!

879
01:24:21,289 --> 01:24:22,996
I'll tell you about the weapon.

880
01:24:31,366 --> 01:24:32,868
It's a new flavor crystal formula.

881
01:24:32,934 --> 01:24:34,811
Twice the chocolaty goodness,
half the calories.

882
01:24:34,869 --> 01:24:36,678
Plus, it helps
prevent tooth decay. There.

883
01:24:46,214 --> 01:24:48,319
You're brave, King.

884
01:24:48,383 --> 01:24:49,828
I'll give you that.

885
01:24:50,952 --> 01:24:54,832
But underneath all that swagger,

886
01:24:54,889 --> 01:24:57,836
I know what you really fear.

887
01:24:58,359 --> 01:25:01,829
What would hurt you
more than anything else.

888
01:25:15,176 --> 01:25:20,057
You don't want to go back
to being one of us, do you?

889
01:25:28,423 --> 01:25:32,496
I'm gonna bite you again, King.

890
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:37,305
And I'm gonna leave you here
while you turn.

891
01:25:37,365 --> 01:25:41,142
I'm going to watch you day after day

892
01:25:41,202 --> 01:25:45,582
as the thirst
keeps building and building.

893
01:25:48,042 --> 01:25:49,646
And then,

894
01:25:49,711 --> 01:25:53,420
when you can't stand it anymore...

895
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:01,696
...I'm gonna bring the little girl in here...

896
01:26:03,358 --> 01:26:05,133
...for you to feed on.

897
01:26:07,028 --> 01:26:09,269
Would you like that, King?

898
01:26:10,798 --> 01:26:13,972
Would you enjoy taking her life?

899
01:26:30,018 --> 01:26:32,055
Now we're getting somewhere, my pet.

900
01:26:54,142 --> 01:26:55,450
Are you all right?

901
01:26:56,744 --> 01:26:58,690
Yeah. I'll be fine.

902
01:27:01,349 --> 01:27:03,420
Don't let it turn inward.

903
01:27:05,553 --> 01:27:08,762
Ever since I can remember,
I've had this...

904
01:27:10,091 --> 01:27:14,597
I've had this knife of sadness
in my heart.

905
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:20,679
And as long as it's there,

906
01:27:20,735 --> 01:27:24,740
you know, I'm--I'm strong.
and I'm--I'm untouchable.

907
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:30,018
But the moment that I take it out...

908
01:27:35,984 --> 01:27:38,225
...I-I'll just die.

909
01:28:36,978 --> 01:28:38,252
He's one of ours.

910
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:39,849
My name is Caulder.

911
01:28:39,914 --> 01:28:41,951
I'll be your driver this evening.

912
01:28:51,759 --> 01:28:54,239
Sommerfield left you a video message.

913
01:28:58,266 --> 01:29:00,507
If you're watching this,
l'm already dead.

914
01:29:01,436 --> 01:29:06,112
If Zoe's alive, l want you to promise me
that you'll take care of her, okay?

915
01:29:06,174 --> 01:29:08,848
I've been reading her
the Oz books every night.

916
01:29:10,044 --> 01:29:12,547
We just started reading
The Emerald City of Oz.

917
01:29:12,613 --> 01:29:15,025
You know, the one with the Nome King?

918
01:29:17,719 --> 01:29:21,565
l think I've managed to cultivate
a workable strain of the Day Star virus.

919
01:29:21,622 --> 01:29:24,796
As a precaution, l transmitted
the genetic sequence to Caulder

920
01:29:24,859 --> 01:29:26,998
in case our main stock was destroyed.

921
01:29:27,829 --> 01:29:29,934
In order for it
to achieve maximum lethality,

922
01:29:29,997 --> 01:29:32,307
you're gonna need to interfese it
with Drake's blood.

923
01:29:33,167 --> 01:29:37,138
Now, if it works,
every vampire in the immediate vicinity

924
01:29:37,205 --> 01:29:38,741
should die almost instantly.

925
01:29:39,974 --> 01:29:41,544
There's one other thing.

926
01:29:42,076 --> 01:29:44,818
Blade, you need to know

927
01:29:44,879 --> 01:29:47,519
that there's a chance
the virus could destroy you, too.

928
01:29:47,582 --> 01:29:48,856
Because you're a hybrid,

929
01:29:48,916 --> 01:29:52,329
I--l'm not sure if your immune system
will be able to tolerate it.

930
01:29:53,488 --> 01:29:57,868
l'm sorry. We just didn't have
enough time to properly test it.

931
01:30:00,428 --> 01:30:04,035
So, shall we take a Iook
at the plague arrow?

932
01:30:05,099 --> 01:30:08,637
I only had time to fabricate
a small amount of Day Star.

933
01:30:09,504 --> 01:30:14,510
However, I was able to outfit it.

934
01:30:15,777 --> 01:30:17,916
A compressed gas projectile...

935
01:30:19,247 --> 01:30:25,163
...that can be shot from one
of the four-barrel rifles or a bow.

936
01:30:27,622 --> 01:30:31,229
Either way, you must be sure
that the shot counts.

937
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:34,606
You would simply not have enough
for a second shot.

938
01:30:44,439 --> 01:30:46,248
Do you know who I am?

939
01:30:46,741 --> 01:30:48,379
You're the Nome King.

940
01:30:49,877 --> 01:30:50,947
Ah.

941
01:30:51,012 --> 01:30:53,014
The Nome King.

942
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:55,060
How sweet.

943
01:30:55,116 --> 01:30:58,290
Tell me, child,
do you want to die?

944
01:30:58,386 --> 01:30:59,865
I'm not afraid.

945
01:30:59,921 --> 01:31:01,457
I'll go to Heaven.

946
01:31:02,323 --> 01:31:03,529
There is no Heaven.

947
01:31:03,591 --> 01:31:07,004
No God, no angels.

948
01:31:07,061 --> 01:31:10,338
The only thing in your future
is nothingness.

949
01:31:10,398 --> 01:31:12,674
But what if you could change that?

950
01:31:12,733 --> 01:31:15,680
What if you could
remain a child forever?

951
01:31:16,504 --> 01:31:18,040
Wouldn't you like that?

952
01:31:18,105 --> 01:31:20,085
Wouldn't you accept that gift?

953
01:31:21,742 --> 01:31:24,382
My friends are coming to kill you.

954
01:31:46,968 --> 01:31:49,107
This blood

955
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:00,352
Wake the night!

956
01:32:08,256 --> 01:32:10,668
It's gonna wake the night.

957
01:32:16,497 --> 01:32:18,067
It's gonna wake the night

958
01:32:18,132 --> 01:32:19,907
Wake the night!

959
01:32:19,967 --> 01:32:21,844
This blood.

960
01:32:25,072 --> 01:32:26,312
This blood.

961
01:32:26,374 --> 01:32:28,786
It's gonna wake the night.

962
01:32:28,843 --> 01:32:31,050
This blood.

963
01:32:32,213 --> 01:32:33,783
This blood.

964
01:32:33,848 --> 01:32:36,488
It's gonna wake the night!

965
01:32:50,565 --> 01:32:53,136
- This blood
- Wake the night!

966
01:33:00,374 --> 01:33:02,047
It's gonna wake the night

967
01:33:09,450 --> 01:33:11,487
- This blood
- Wake the night!

968
01:33:19,226 --> 01:33:20,933
Wake the night!

969
01:33:20,995 --> 01:33:22,440
This blood.

970
01:33:23,598 --> 01:33:25,908
This blood.

971
01:33:25,967 --> 01:33:28,174
It's gonna wake the night!

972
01:33:38,145 --> 01:33:40,284
Gonna be sorry you did that.

973
01:33:40,348 --> 01:33:41,349
Why?

974
01:33:43,818 --> 01:33:46,128
Nobody's coming for you, King shit.

975
01:33:48,255 --> 01:33:49,290
Sure they are.

976
01:33:50,191 --> 01:33:51,192
God--

977
01:33:51,258 --> 01:33:56,765
See, one of the things you fuckheads
need to know about us Nightstalkers

978
01:33:56,831 --> 01:34:02,213
is that when you join our club, you get
all sorts of groovy little door prizes.

979
01:34:02,269 --> 01:34:07,048
And one of them is this nifty little tracking
node surgically implanted in your body.

980
01:34:09,076 --> 01:34:10,214
- Bullshit.
- Yeah.

981
01:34:13,514 --> 01:34:15,619
See, when one of us goes missing...

982
01:34:16,917 --> 01:34:19,693
...the others,
they just dial up the satellite

983
01:34:19,754 --> 01:34:21,461
which is in space.

984
01:34:21,522 --> 01:34:23,160
And then presto.

985
01:34:23,924 --> 01:34:25,835
Instant cavalry.

986
01:34:26,827 --> 01:34:28,170
You like that, huh?

987
01:34:29,530 --> 01:34:30,873
Go fuck your sister.

988
01:34:30,931 --> 01:34:32,842
Okay, King.

989
01:34:34,101 --> 01:34:37,548
Where is this tracking node of yours?

990
01:34:38,506 --> 01:34:40,144
It's in my left ass check.

991
01:34:41,509 --> 01:34:42,817
Fine.

992
01:34:42,877 --> 01:34:44,618
It's in my right ass cheek.

993
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:48,485
Okay, I'm--okay, seriously, now.

994
01:34:49,617 --> 01:34:53,064
It's in the meat of my butt,
just below the Hello Kitty tattoo.

995
01:34:56,590 --> 01:34:59,503
Seriously, just pull down
my tighty-whities and see for yourself.

996
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:00,561
Enough!

997
01:35:00,628 --> 01:35:02,369
It's not funny anymore!

998
01:35:02,430 --> 01:35:05,001
No, it's not,
you horse-humping bitch!

999
01:35:05,066 --> 01:35:07,512
But it will be a few seconds from now.

1000
01:35:08,803 --> 01:35:11,750
See, that tickle that you're feeling
in the back of your throat right now...

1001
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:15,914
...that's atomized colloidal silver.

1002
01:35:15,976 --> 01:35:18,582
It's being pumped through
the building's air conditioning system,

1003
01:35:18,646 --> 01:35:21,422
you cock-juggling thunder cunt!

1004
01:35:30,391 --> 01:35:33,600
Which means the fat lady
should be singing

1005
01:35:33,661 --> 01:35:37,336
right about now!

1006
01:35:45,473 --> 01:35:47,111
This is awkward.

1007
01:35:48,909 --> 01:35:50,718
Do you have a cell phone?

1008
01:36:16,070 --> 01:36:19,244
Um...a little help here.

1009
01:37:01,615 --> 01:37:03,652
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1010
01:37:03,717 --> 01:37:05,162
- Where's Zoe?
- Drake's got her.

1011
01:37:05,219 --> 01:37:06,596
Okay.

1012
01:37:10,524 --> 01:37:11,594
Thank you.

1013
01:37:12,793 --> 01:37:14,431
I brought your toys.

1014
01:37:15,329 --> 01:37:16,740
Try to keep up.

1015
01:37:35,916 --> 01:37:37,224
Aah!

1016
01:39:24,658 --> 01:39:26,035
Abby!

1017
01:39:26,126 --> 01:39:27,161
Hey.

1018
01:39:28,662 --> 01:39:30,300
You okay?

1019
01:39:30,364 --> 01:39:32,469
Okay. let's get you out of here.

1020
01:39:32,533 --> 01:39:33,739
Watch out!

1021
01:39:54,521 --> 01:39:56,523
Fuck me.

1022
01:39:59,259 --> 01:40:02,103
Oh, fuck me sideways!

1023
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,104
Oh, yeah.

1024
01:40:07,668 --> 01:40:10,012
He's a cute little guy, aren't ya?

1025
01:40:10,070 --> 01:40:11,276
Good little puppies.

1026
01:40:11,338 --> 01:40:13,318
Yeah, you're gonna stay.

1027
01:40:13,374 --> 01:40:14,853
You stay.

1028
01:40:14,908 --> 01:40:17,115
Oh. There's a pretty smile.

1029
01:40:17,711 --> 01:40:18,781
Yeah.

1030
01:40:18,846 --> 01:40:20,587
I'm going to, uh...

1031
01:41:01,088 --> 01:41:02,396
Hey, dickface.

1032
01:41:02,456 --> 01:41:04,333
You seen my dog?

1033
01:41:04,391 --> 01:41:06,462
Have you tried the lobby?

1034
01:41:08,796 --> 01:41:09,900
Thank you.

1035
01:41:15,836 --> 01:41:17,042
Fuck...

1036
01:41:17,104 --> 01:41:18,276
Come on, King.

1037
01:41:18,338 --> 01:41:19,715
...this.

1038
01:41:37,257 --> 01:41:38,600
Blade.

1039
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:41,398
Ready to die?

1040
01:41:44,131 --> 01:41:46,236
I was born ready, motherfucker.

1041
01:41:49,069 --> 01:41:50,639
Motherfucker.

1042
01:41:50,704 --> 01:41:52,206
I like that.

1043
01:41:53,340 --> 01:41:55,650
Aah!

1044
01:42:53,467 --> 01:42:55,276
Aah!

1045
01:43:09,650 --> 01:43:11,061
Aah!

1046
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:21,940
Aah!

1047
01:43:36,076 --> 01:43:37,851
You broke my arm!

1048
01:45:33,694 --> 01:45:36,140
Aah!

1049
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:29,486
Are you ready to die, motherfucker?

1050
01:49:00,433 --> 01:49:01,776
Give it up.

1051
01:49:01,835 --> 01:49:03,337
Come on.
Give it up, King.

1052
01:49:03,904 --> 01:49:06,180
Give it up.
Give it up.

1053
01:49:06,239 --> 01:49:07,445
Give it up.

1054
01:49:34,501 --> 01:49:35,912
Hang in there, kitten.

1055
01:49:35,969 --> 01:49:37,346
I'll get help.

1056
01:49:47,781 --> 01:49:49,920
Funny, isn't it?

1057
01:49:50,450 --> 01:49:54,694
All this time, my people were trying
to create a new kind of vampire,

1058
01:49:54,754 --> 01:49:57,997
when one already exists.

1059
01:49:59,593 --> 01:50:01,334
I don't need to survive.

1060
01:50:01,394 --> 01:50:04,568
The future of our race rests with you.

1061
01:50:06,066 --> 01:50:07,909
You fought with honor.

1062
01:50:07,968 --> 01:50:09,709
I respect that.

1063
01:50:11,171 --> 01:50:13,151
Allow me a parting gift.

1064
01:50:14,574 --> 01:50:16,076
But remember this.

1065
01:50:16,977 --> 01:50:20,186
Sooner or later,

1066
01:50:20,246 --> 01:50:23,750
the thirst always wins.

1067
01:53:23,196 --> 01:53:24,402
And Blade?

1068
01:53:25,398 --> 01:53:27,639
The virus didn't kill him.

1069
01:53:27,700 --> 01:53:30,544
Because he was a hybrid,
his heart never stopped beating.

1070
01:53:30,603 --> 01:53:32,446
It simply slowed down.

1071
01:53:32,505 --> 01:53:34,280
And so he slept,

1072
01:53:34,340 --> 01:53:36,980
waiting for the moment when he
could walk the earth again.

1073
01:54:00,533 --> 01:54:02,103
Yo, yo.

1074
01:54:02,168 --> 01:54:04,205
It's the feast of the blood.

1075
01:54:04,270 --> 01:54:05,806
Unleash the beast within.

1076
01:54:05,872 --> 01:54:08,785
I walk around with the strength
of a hundred men.

1077
01:54:09,542 --> 01:54:11,419
You best run before I count to ten.

1078
01:54:11,477 --> 01:54:14,686
Blood dripping from my canine
like a fountain pen.

1079
01:54:14,747 --> 01:54:17,591
The shape-shifting mirror image
flash photo type.

1080
01:54:17,650 --> 01:54:20,722
The everlasting vision,
the red battle type.

1081
01:54:51,484 --> 01:54:54,431
Try to use my name, that's fatal.

1082
01:54:54,487 --> 01:54:57,400
Tried to claim my fame,
but that's fatal.

1083
01:54:57,457 --> 01:55:00,461
About to raise the pain,
that's fatal.

1084
01:55:00,526 --> 01:55:03,769
Bite through your jugular vein,
that's fatal

1085
01:55:03,830 --> 01:55:05,776
Walk with me,
come on, walk with me.

1086
01:55:05,832 --> 01:55:08,711
Come on, walk with me,
come on, walk with me.

1087
01:55:08,868 --> 01:55:11,872
Come on, walk with me,
come on, walk with me.

1088
01:55:11,938 --> 01:55:15,112
Come on, walk with me,
walk with me.

1089
01:55:15,174 --> 01:55:18,621
I strike back with a vengeance,
The father, your descendants.

1090
01:55:18,678 --> 01:55:21,818
And I can't be deflected
by your silver cross pendants.

1091
01:55:21,881 --> 01:55:24,725
Bloody holy water,
you made the false images

1092
01:55:24,784 --> 01:55:27,731
What's waiting for the sickle?
You're like the nemesis.

1093
01:55:27,787 --> 01:55:30,961
Sting like the scorpion,
strike with the force again.

1094
01:55:31,024 --> 01:55:34,471
My blood in those
who revitalize the corpse I'm in.

1095
01:55:34,527 --> 01:55:37,474
And the last thing,
they said the dead would walk again.

1096
01:55:37,530 --> 01:55:40,568
The blind, deaf and the dumb
will talk again.

1097
01:55:40,633 --> 01:55:43,136
Try to use my name, that's fatal.

1098
01:55:43,202 --> 01:55:46,649
Trying to claim my fame,
that's fatal.

1099
01:55:46,706 --> 01:55:49,312
About to raise the pain,
that's fatal.

1100
01:55:49,375 --> 01:55:52,447
Bite through your jugular vein,
that's fatal.

1101
01:56:30,049 --> 01:56:32,962
You don't even know me.

1102
01:56:33,019 --> 01:56:35,966
You can't even see me.

1103
01:56:36,022 --> 01:56:38,662
Friendlier than daylight.

1104
01:56:38,725 --> 01:56:41,604
Now I'm back, now I'm back again.

1105
01:56:41,661 --> 01:56:44,574
Don't be scared, baby.

1106
01:56:44,630 --> 01:56:47,839
Can't you see I'm thirsty?

1107
01:56:47,900 --> 01:56:50,540
Friends of the daylight.

1108
01:56:50,603 --> 01:56:53,743
Let me drink,
let me drink, my friend.

1109
01:56:53,806 --> 01:56:56,582
Don't be scared, baby.

1110
01:56:56,642 --> 01:56:59,521
Don't be afraid.

1111
01:56:59,579 --> 01:57:02,423
Friends of the daylight.

1112
01:57:02,482 --> 01:57:05,486
And I'm back, and I'm back again.

1113
01:57:05,551 --> 01:57:08,464
Never going nowhere.

1114
01:57:08,521 --> 01:57:11,764
You can't run from me.

1115
01:57:11,824 --> 01:57:14,464
Day or night, baby.

1116
01:57:14,527 --> 01:57:18,566
Can I drink, can I drink again?

1117
01:57:18,998 --> 01:57:20,909
Yeah.

1118
01:57:21,334 --> 01:57:25,874
Yeah.

1119
01:57:26,372 --> 01:57:30,047
Can we drink,
can we drink, my friend?

1120
01:57:30,109 --> 01:57:32,919
Don't be scared, baby.

1121
01:57:33,079 --> 01:57:35,525
Don't be scared, baby.

1122
01:57:35,581 --> 01:57:38,221
Can't you see I'm thirsty?

1123
01:57:38,284 --> 01:57:40,628
And I'm back, and I'm back again.

1124
01:57:40,686 --> 01:57:43,326
First things first, man,
you can't fight the thirst.

1125
01:57:43,389 --> 01:57:46,336
You can't call the doctor,
you can't call the nurse.

1126
01:57:46,392 --> 01:57:49,134
You got that Louis logo
on the side of your purse.

1127
01:57:49,195 --> 01:57:52,438
And those tight minis
about to make me burst.

1128
01:57:52,498 --> 01:57:55,411
I can't think,
let me sink into your jugular.

1129
01:57:55,468 --> 01:57:58,381
Come have a drink
with the thirsty love guzzler.

1130
01:57:58,438 --> 01:58:00,884
From the dark side,
baby, don't be afraid.

1131
01:58:00,940 --> 01:58:04,319
You can't fight the thirst
nor escape the plague.

1132
01:58:04,377 --> 01:58:07,551
I've been scopin' ya
hoping you'd be open to.

1133
01:58:07,613 --> 01:58:10,526
Take a sip of the potion
'cause it's overdue.

1134
01:58:10,583 --> 01:58:13,587
It's not your ordinary,
it's a special brew.

1135
01:58:13,653 --> 01:58:16,497
In the heat of the night,
I will rescue you.

1136
01:58:17,990 --> 01:58:20,470
Never going nowhere.

1137
01:58:20,526 --> 01:58:23,735
You can't run from me.

1138
01:58:23,796 --> 01:58:26,572
Day or night, baby.

1139
01:58:26,632 --> 01:58:30,444
Can I drink, can I drink again?

1140
01:58:31,204 --> 01:58:32,706
Yeah.

1141
01:58:33,272 --> 01:58:37,948
Yeah.

1142
01:58:38,478 --> 01:58:41,982
Can we drink,
can we drink, my friend?

1143
01:58:42,048 --> 01:58:44,722
Don't be scared, baby.

1144
01:58:44,884 --> 01:58:47,831
Don't be scared, baby.

1145
01:58:47,887 --> 01:58:50,493
Can't you see I'm thirsty?

1146
01:58:50,556 --> 01:58:53,730
And I'm back, and I'm back again.

1147
01:58:53,793 --> 01:58:56,239
Allow me a parting gift.

1148
01:58:57,296 --> 01:58:59,139
But remember this.

1149
01:58:59,832 --> 01:59:03,075
Sooner or later,

1150
01:59:03,136 --> 01:59:06,674
the thirst will always win.

1151
01:59:26,726 --> 01:59:29,673
And I'm back, and I'm back again
