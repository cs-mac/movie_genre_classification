1
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:09,049
 No... What did she do
so wrong that she has to apologize?

2
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,549
Because she didn't do what she was suppose to do, my
daughter just showed what was supposed to be done.

3
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:16,879
What do you mean? Say something that makes sense.
Just because Bin is not doing well right now,

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,490
she expressed her frustration physically!

5
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,670
Bin's mother is no joke.

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,480
Ah, geez.

7
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:33,460
You... Apologize to Bin!

8
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:41,530
If you don't, I won't send you home today.

9
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:48,449
Who are you not let to my daughter go home?
Wow, you really have no conscience.

10
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,319
Everyone knows that not one scene can
be shot because of her NGs (No Goods).

11
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,219
While filming, NGs are possible.

12
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,459
How are you going to make her into a child
actress without even understanding that?

13
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,909
Why don't you just do well yourself?

14
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:05,799
Aigoo... What to do? She can't act. You should
have had her practice more before coming.

15
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,629
<i>If she has no talent, why
do you have her in acting?</i>

16
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:12,449
<i>This is her first shoot.</i> Her very first!

17
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,590
Is there a kid who is good from start?

18
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,520
My mom is right.

19
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,750
You! Apologize to Bin right now!

20
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,489
Won Shik! Won Shik!

21
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,450
Yes, Director?

22
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,899
Let's rest for ten minutes.

23
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:46,960
Okay! We'll take a break!
A ten-minute break!

24
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,840
Let's go.

25
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,280
Excuse me.

26
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:05,490
I'll have Bin practice her acting. Why don't have Ji Young
to apologize for pushing Bin earlier, however she wanted?

27
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:10,180
Pushing me was wrong on your part.

28
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,800
Apologize.

29
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:21,510
Sorry. Sorry for pushing you earlier.

30
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,610
Okay.

31
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:29,699
Enough? Let's go.

32
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,690
Mom is pitiful.

33
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,129
You're not hurt?

34
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,989
I'm not.

35
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:43,839
It's a break, let's practice.

36
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,670
Okay.

37
00:02:44,671 --> 00:02:46,920
You did so well at home, though.

38
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,829
But still, that's fascinating. How can
you fight during the first shooting?

39
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,699
She and her mom were terrible.

40
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,519
Let's say that she endured it for hundred times and
couldn't hold in the anger any longer so she pushed Bin.

41
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,749
Then the mom should scold her child, but
instead was talking all righteously.

42
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,409
That ahjumma is truly a strange ahjumma.

43
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:12,599
That's right. When the
filming ended, I heard

44
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,699
that the kid was famous in her neighborhood and
that her Mother was known as a major crank.

45
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:21,419
She picked the wrong person. You're not
someone who would take that kind of behavior.

46
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,450
Jye Yeong got a serious
scolding from Mom today.

47
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:41,519
Bin, that today you called Mom, "Mom",

48
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,890
Mom was extremely happy.

49
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,369
Unni, you're now calling my Mom, "Mom"?

50
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:57,669
Then, I'll also call my
stepdad, "Dad." Daddy!

51
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,580
Of course you can, our youngest daughter.

52
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:08,130
Ah, right. Bin, what about Mom?
Finish what you were saying.

53
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:16,449
Mom said to Jye Yeong that she wouldn't
let her go home until she apologized.

54
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:21,250
So, Jye Yeong said to me she was sorry.

55
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:25,469
Your Mom, since she was this little,

56
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:31,300
she never came home from
a fight she didn't win.

57
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:35,349
But, what if she torments Bin again?

58
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,459
That's why, for now, I need to
go to the filming location.

59
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,729
That way those people won't dare
bother Bin. Don't you think so, Bin?

60
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:46,949
Also, if I had gone with Grandpa it would have been a
disaster. He wouldn't have known how to do my hair, right?

61
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:51,609
True. Next time, I'll do your
hair and make-up even prettier.

62
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:55,699
Will you do my make-up
if I pass an audition?

63
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,129
Of course!

64
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:02,179
If you get picked to be filmed,
I'll be really happy for you.

65
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,570
I would like that.

66
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,369
What's the matter? Are
you in pain somewhere?

67
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:21,510
No. I'm fine.

68
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:26,479
What happened with Bin today, thank you.

69
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:33,789
You don't need to thank me. If there's any thanking to do, then I should
be saying it. When Woo Ri was crying about her dad, you were by her side.

70
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:37,509
And I'm grateful to you for always trying to
fulfill the dad role with Woo Ri and Woo Joo

71
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:40,529
That's given since I'm their dad now.

72
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:46,919
Still, is it easy to decide to do that from
the start? I'm in awe of you every day.

73
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,179
Why? I guess you're not doing
that with Soo and Bin, huh?

74
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:56,709
I'm not saying that I'm not. But honestly, I'm more careful
around them than I would be with Woo Young or Woo Ri.

75
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:01,250
And at times, eyes from the
second floor are watching me too.

76
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,949
In any case, thank you for
opening up Bin's heart.

77
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,219
Soo and Bin don't even remember their mom.

78
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:16,229
Today, I was much happier
because Bin called me "Mom."

79
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:19,340
Thanks to you I got to hear
Woo Joo call me "Dad."

80
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,459
Daddy, read a book to me.

81
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:28,940
Ok, Woo Joo. What shall we read?
Let's read over here with me.

82
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,960
What should we read?

83
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:42,249
"Let's figure it out together."

84
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:45,579
"We can tell what it is just
by looking at the shape."

85
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,479
"It's time for school." It's written here.

86
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,549
"I will call it the lucky fin."

87
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,209
Call it a lucky fin.

88
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:56,210
"It will bring you luck."

89
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:05,489
- Wait a minute. Bellflower root. There is Bellflower root in the fridge.
- Okay.

90
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,610
Get that out too.

91
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:13,730
Let's see if the fish is done grilling.

92
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,889
What's going on? What's with the
sumptuous feast for breakfast?

93
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:29,589
I'm trying to feed Teacher Kim.

94
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:34,569
Teacher Kim? Tae Min? Why would
Tae Min be eating at our house?

95
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:38,449
You said that Teacher Kim is
not eating at his home lately.

96
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:42,269
If he is not being fed at his house, then we
should at least feed him before sending him home.

97
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:45,560
They said they're coming; I
wonder why they're not here yet.

98
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:53,409
I might not know how Teacher
Kim's mom treats you, but

99
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:55,679
take a look at Teacher Kim.

100
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,769
Look at how hard he is trying even
though we are objecting to him.

101
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:02,399
He says he'll handle everything
to change his mother's mind.

102
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,709
He even comes here in the
morning to run with your dad.

103
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:09,819
I also tried to behave well.

104
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:13,550
Calling her "ahjumma" is behaving well?

105
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:19,749
If you showed your temper once that's
enough. Also, you still like Teacher Kim.

106
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:24,850
Then you should also lower your head and get
in there if you're not planning to break-up.

107
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,690
Let's see.

108
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:40,259
I have octopus that I bought. Should I
cook it quickly in the pressure cooker?

109
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,230
Madam, there's no space on the table.

110
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,609
Really? Bin really said "Mother"?

111
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,789
Yes. So our whole family
were all surprised. Right?

112
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,339
Yeah. That's right. I was
really surprised, too.

113
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:12,369
Woo Joo called me "Dad" too,
after hearing Bin say it.

114
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:16,509
That's great, I'm glad. It boosted the
kid's confidence and gave affection too.

115
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:20,070
I'm glad that the kids' mom
went there instead of me!

116
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,019
Then I'll be on my way.

117
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,829
You're not thirsty today?

118
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,599
Why don't you eat with us before you go?

119
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,489
Where? On the third floor?

120
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:32,619
Mother-in-law asked me to make sure
he eats with us before he goes.

121
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,969
Really? Can I really do that?

122
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:40,329
Well, I didn't allow it yet.
My principles are unchanged.

123
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:45,149
I can only allow it after you convince
your parents. Before then, there's no way.

124
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,689
He's trying his best to convince
them right now, Father.

125
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:51,209
Don't be like that and
please open up your heart.

126
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:56,050
It's hard enough for them. It'll
be nice to lessen their burden.

127
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,419
Come on, let's go in. Come
on kids, let's go in.

128
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,859
Yes. Let's go, Teacher.

129
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,519
Let's go. Hurry up.

130
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,230
Let's go.

131
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,669
I don't want to eat breakfast, Grandma.

132
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:21,029
How can you go to work on an empty stomach?
Just have a little at least.

133
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,849
It's okay. My stomach doesn't
feel good, that's why.

134
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,849
You still don't feel okay?

135
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:29,069
Then... You should go to the hospital.

136
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:35,619
I was going to, but I'm too busy with
work because there's an event going on.

137
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,489
I'll go once it's over.

138
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:38,939
<i>- Go and wash up.
- Yes.</i>

139
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,199
The kids must be back.

140
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,510
<i>Make sure to wash well.</i>

141
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,189
Teacher Kim, please eat.

142
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,249
Yes. I will eat well, Mother.

143
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,449
Okay.

144
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:07,660
But... Where's Jin Joo?

145
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:16,119
Let her be. I think she doesn't know
what to do after asking to break up.

146
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:21,589
You prepared so much food. She's usually
really good to her sons-in-law.

147
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:25,979
Teacher Kim, don't think
about anything and eat up.

148
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,520
Yes.

149
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,370
Oh, yes.

150
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:37,049
Side dishes are really delicious, Mother.

151
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,259
Really?

152
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:41,029
I'm relieved the taste is to your liking.

153
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,380
- Eat this as well.
- Yes.

154
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,529
- What would you like, Honey?
- Me?

155
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:51,179
Why are you making a face?
Hurry up and eat.

156
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,230
I am eating.

157
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:16,149
I want to see Tae Min, too.

158
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:20,110
I want to have breakfast with Tae Min, too!

159
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:30,919
Then we'll do a separate photo session with Kim Sang Min
instead of sending out reporters to his One Point lesson.

160
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,129
VIPs are sensitive to being photographed,
so let's pay special attention to that.

161
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,619
Myung Jae, please redo the
time table and upload it.

162
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,159
Yes, I will.

163
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,639
Then our meeting for today is over.

164
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,289
By the way, Manager Do stopped
by the business management team.

165
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,719
I had a short conversation with him,

166
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,719
and he said that Kim Sang Min's parents
were on the One Point lesson guest list.

167
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,139
Really?

168
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,099
Did you check the guest list?

169
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:58,309
Yes, I did. Manager Do told
me not to mind it too much.

170
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:01,049
He said he only mentioned it so that it doesn't
come as a surprise on the day of the event.

171
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,989
How did we not know about it
when they're our brand's VIPs?

172
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:07,369
There are a lot of people who don't take
part in events even if they're VIPs.

173
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:10,489
On top of that, Kim Sang Min doesn't
really go around with his parents.

174
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:15,370
That's true. The agency has always followed him
around instead, since the beginning of his career.

175
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,249
What do we do during the One Point lesson?

176
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,149
Shouldn't we take the 2nd floor
adults off of the guest list?

177
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,549
We already made calls and
sent out the invites.

178
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:37,119
It's one thing if they said they're not coming,
but we can't prevent them from attending.

179
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,320
What if they fight again that day?

180
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,060
Come in.

181
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:54,479
Where are your parents?

182
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,949
Oh, they went down to Ganghwado in
the morning for something urgent.

183
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:02,009
Come over here. Sit here. I'll be
back after putting the cake away.

184
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,530
Okay.

185
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,389
It was hot coming over here, right? Why did you insist
on coming by yourself when I offered to pick you up?

186
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,199
Why should you bother yourself?

187
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:23,010
It was nice to look around the apartment
complex after getting off the bus.

188
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:31,050
When I came over last time for dinner, I didn't get a
chance to look around, but the house is very clean.

189
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:37,399
Where's your room? Mom told me to
look and see if you need anything.

190
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:41,609
I don't need anything. Over there is my
room, and over there is Tae Min's room.

191
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:45,589
When we get married and Tae Min moves
out, I'll make his room into your study.

192
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,189
Really?

193
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:51,559
Then, what we need first
is a desk and a bookcase.

194
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,610
I'll get those things ready myself, too.

195
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:03,810
How can I just move in empty-handed?
I should buy things we need.

196
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:07,490
I told you, I'll get everything ready.

197
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:20,409
Sang Min, what is all this?

198
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:24,089
Isn't it nice that there are many of me?

199
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:28,729
Once we get married, let's keep one
here and keep one in your study.

200
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,909
When I'm traveling for competitions,
you'll be scared being home by yourself.

201
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:34,689
Won't it be reassuring? Look at me as
much as you want whenever you miss me.

202
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:37,360
I'll think about it...

203
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:53,379
We should get a new bed.

204
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:58,130
Yeon Tae. Sit down over here.

205
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:01,219
Why?

206
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,520
Sit over here.

207
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:20,190
Since you're in my room like
this, it finally feels real.

208
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:24,859
The fact that we're getting married
and becoming husband and wife.

209
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:29,829
After we get married, this room
will become our newlywed room.

210
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,789
Right.

211
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:37,099
Let's live really happily and well.
I will make you very happy.

212
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,679
I will make you very happy, too.

213
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,210
Just having you next to
me is happiness for me.

214
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:01,839
Yeon Doo. Yeon Doo, what's the matter?

215
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,799
I think we should keep the
life-size photos out of our home.

216
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,529
Why?

217
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:10,360
I like the real thing.

218
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,159
Huh? That...

219
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,250
Why not finish what we started...

220
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:27,289
I was going to buy some dishes, but you live better
than I expected for two men sharing a house together.

221
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:30,759
Since I have to watch what I eat, I try
to eat at home as much as possible.

222
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:35,429
Tae Min was the one in charge of cooking, but I've
been working really hard to learn how to cook.

223
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,319
You saw last time, right? My lunchbox.

224
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,719
Then when we get married,
you're going to cook for me?

225
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,710
Of course! Come and sit. It's all done.

226
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,120
I will eat well.

227
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,320
Ouch!

228
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,869
That's why you should watch it.

229
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:10,920
You were cute, so I tried
to do a cream-kiss...

230
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,850
Ouch, it hurts.

231
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:18,250
What about the trip? Have
you thought about it?

232
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:24,290
Don't be like that and let's go. Even
if it's somewhere close by, huh?

233
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:31,619
To be honest, I wanted to go see the
ocean before the summer was over, but...

234
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:37,049
Really?! Then how about Gangneung?
Have you been to Gangneung?

235
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,909
Go on a two day and one night trip?

236
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,029
Yeah. I have another morning off.

237
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:47,320
Since the shoot is in the afternoon the next day, I can take
my time coming back in the morning. Let's go, Soon Young.

238
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:54,559
But still, is it okay that we go off on a trip by ourselves
when your parents are working at the restaurant?

239
00:18:54,560 --> 00:19:00,149
Of course it's okay. You know my parents aren't the
type to make us self-conscious about those things.

240
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:05,759
Also, you will soon start to show, so it'll
be harder for you to move around as easily.

241
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,810
While I have the time, let's
go on a short trip, huh?

242
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,420
Hello.

243
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:16,919
Yes, where are you off to?

244
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,539
I'm going to Father-in-law's restaurant
to take back the kimchi container.

245
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:23,089
Ah, I was on my way to the in-law's too.
That's great. Let's go together.

246
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:24,109
Okay.

247
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:26,489
Let's go.

248
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:29,030
<i>Please come this way.</i>

249
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:35,739
What brings you by at this hour? We
were about to close and leave soon.

250
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:39,269
And you too. You could have brought
this back another time, too.

251
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,739
Why would you bother bringing
it back so late in the evening?

252
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:45,139
I had indigestion, so I
walked here as exercise.

253
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:48,219
By chance I met her by the stairs.

254
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:53,719
And she said she was coming
by here so I came along.

255
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,389
I'm glad you did.

256
00:19:55,390 --> 00:20:02,789
But, are the wedding preparations going well
for your daughter? Do you have a date set?

257
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:05,079
We're thinking about a fall wedding.

258
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,990
Omo! You found a wedding venue?

259
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:12,029
Well...

260
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:16,419
Oh don't worry. She's
marrying someone nice,

261
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:19,049
so why would you bother to think about me?

262
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:23,090
Jin Joo is Jin Joo, and your
daughter should get married.

263
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:32,259
But, I don't think it'll be easy on
Jin Joo to go through a breakup.

264
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:36,890
Apparently, Teacher Kim comes
over every morning for exercise.

265
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,749
Son-in-law and the kids
exercise every morning.

266
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:46,179
And he comes over all the way from
his house to here every morning.

267
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:49,979
Today he ate breakfast with
us before he went home!

268
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,139
I see.

269
00:20:52,140 --> 00:21:00,140
In-law, you're okay with Jin Joo and Yeon
Tae marrying into the same family, right?

270
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,659
<i>Of course she doesn't like it.
I don't like it either.</i>

271
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:12,130
<i>Our Jin Joo will get compared to
Yeon Tae for the rest of her life.</i>

272
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,289
Tell me. You don't mind, right?

273
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:20,769
Well, what is there for me to mind?

274
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:23,919
It's just that... you should first...

275
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,929
Right? You're happy too, right?

276
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:30,219
Becoming sisters-in-law as friends will bring them
together for family events and family get-togethers.

277
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:34,299
I think it'll be fun for them.
Don't you think so?

278
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,670
I heard the brothers get
along really well, too.

279
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:43,059
Yeon Tae will become Jin Joo's hyungnim.
Is that okay with you?

280
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,959
Who cares about those titles these days?
I heard that young people nowadays

281
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,919
just call each other by their names
as equals. Isn't that right?

282
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:54,810
Well, that's true. You can always
change those titles later on.

283
00:21:56,150 --> 00:22:02,889
In-law, I'm determined to get
Teacher Kim and Jin Joo married.

284
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:05,369
How?

285
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:11,999
You should pretend you don't know anything. It
could make it awkward for you with your in-laws.

286
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,689
I mean, how will you get them
married when they're so against it?

287
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:21,039
I will have to think of
ways from this moment on.

288
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,729
They say that even if the sky
falls, there's a way out.

289
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:27,630
I'm sure there will be a way
if I use any and all methods.

290
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,629
<i>Is she...</i>

291
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:41,429
<i>Right? I think she's pregnant!</i>

292
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,529
Why? You have indigestion?

293
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:47,079
Yes. I've been like this
since a while back.

294
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,929
Really? Since when?

295
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:52,170
It's been a little while.

296
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:58,629
<i>Maybe she's pregnant with her sixth?</i>

297
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:00,880
<i>I know, right?</i>

298
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:09,439
<i>Then they'll have six kids... I
just can't be happy about it...</i>

299
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,689
<i>Well, who cares? There's
us on the 2nd floor.</i>

300
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:15,159
Don't worry. If you have a
baby, I'll raise the baby.

301
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,409
Pardon?

302
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:20,549
Oh... Are you pregnant?

303
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:25,070
No, Mother. Oh, no. It's not like that.

304
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,589
Really? Are you sure?

305
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:31,080
Yes. I'm not, Mother.

306
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,549
<i>Is it possible you're pregnant
with your third child?</i>

307
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:44,009
<i>It's not like that.</i>

308
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:50,469
<i>I've had indigestion and felt
uncomfortable since a little while back.</i>

309
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,410
<i>It's not a baby, Mom.</i>

310
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:00,449
I've had a bit of indigestion and felt
uncomfortable since a little while back.

311
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:05,749
I think it's because I've had a lot of things
on my mind these days with work and our kids.

312
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,199
- Are you taking medicine?
- I should.

313
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:13,919
You should make sure to take medicine.
There's no use in ignoring pain away.

314
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,989
Oh, I thought you were
pregnant and was so surprised!

315
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:21,659
I thought you might be going
from having five kids to six!

316
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:27,420
But then again, it wouldn't be hard to raise
six when you're already raising five.

317
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,999
You don't understand me, right?

318
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,029
You think I'm bothering my in-laws
with their wedding preparations.

319
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,899
It's about your child.

320
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,789
How can I not understand
when I'm a mom, too?

321
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:50,529
Oh, it's something to congratulate of course
when her daughter is loved and getting married.

322
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:53,569
But I worry about Jin Joo.

323
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:59,319
Aiyoo... I'm wondering what I was doing
while she was suffering so much.

324
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,679
You were taking care of Soo and Bin well.

325
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:06,959
I hope my in-laws will do
well with the wedding.

326
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:13,289
And, when Jin Joo has a good man,
I'd like to marry her off fast.

327
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:18,049
By the way, Woo Young's mom...

328
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:23,499
You were nauseous earlier...

329
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,649
I really am not pregnant!

330
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,409
How long have you been that way?

331
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:33,170
It's no big deal. I used to get like
that when I was under a little stress.

332
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:40,269
By the way, you're coming to our company
tomorrow for One Point lesson, right?

333
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:45,969
Ah... Because of Jin Joo, I don't even know if I want
to go see Kim Sang Min. I don't know if I'll go or not.

334
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:50,040
They said Kim Sang Min's
parents will be there also.

335
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,459
They will be there?

336
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:57,530
Yes, I'm giving you a heads up.

337
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:19,299
Why are you standing here?
Let's go in, huh?

338
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,039
Mom.

339
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,299
What?

340
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,190
I really hate being in Seoul.

341
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:33,589
I want to go down to Kyung
Joo, to Aunt's house.

342
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,919
To Kyung Joo?

343
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:42,139
I want to go to Aunt's pension
and help a little with chores.

344
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:47,650
I want to escape from here and
live in a new environment, Mom.

345
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:55,630
I want to go down there and
forget about everything.

346
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:11,779
Where is So Young?

347
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:16,350
She was frustrated so she'll go home
early, after getting some fresh air.

348
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:24,579
Why don't you leave the shop to me and
go down to Kyung Joo with So Young?

349
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,319
Kyung Joo?

350
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:33,550
So Young wants to go down to her aunt's in Kyung
Joo because she really hates being in Seoul.

351
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:44,989
She's really not living. Her
mind is somewhere else.

352
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:47,660
She's like a shell, moving around.

353
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,859
I'm sorry.

354
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:54,239
I'm not saying it to hear that from you.

355
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,369
So Young is not in her
right mind, right now.

356
00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:04,210
I'm afraid to send her down all by herself, so
please go with her and take a good care of her.

357
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:11,650
What's the matter? You don't want
to do it because of your kids?

358
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:16,830
Because I just started meeting Woo Ri...

359
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:24,459
No. Since So Young became like
this, how can I say anything?

360
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:27,960
I'll try to discuss itwith So Young.

361
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:33,289
When your spouse is having a hard
time, you should be by her side.

362
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:39,489
I knew nothing good would come out of
this kind of marriage, but I let you

363
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:42,379
because So Young said she
couldn't live without you.

364
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:49,010
You became a couple after all that.
You can't end it like this, right?

365
00:28:53,580 --> 00:29:00,250
Go down there with So Young.
I'll call my younger sister.

366
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:10,470
Did they go to work already?

367
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:16,299
Son-in-law Lee! Son-in-law Lee!

368
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:21,169
Talk to me a bit before you go.
I just need five minutes.

369
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:24,140
- I'll wait in the car.
- Okay.

370
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:29,629
You know we'll have the One Point lesson today,
don't you? Did you get an invitation card?

371
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:32,890
Oh... Yes, I got it.

372
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,689
Do you know that your wife is ill?

373
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:39,049
Pardon?

374
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:43,679
When we were at the restaurant
yesterday, she was having dry heaves!

375
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:48,010
She's not pregnant, but her stomach
doesn't feel good and has indigestion.

376
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:55,119
Look, you must take her to the hospital. You can't
leave her like this, and let the disease progress.

377
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:00,930
If something doesn't feel right, even a tiny bit, you
have to take her to the hospital fast! Got that?

378
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:07,079
Yes... Mother-in-law.
Thanks for your advice.

379
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,150
<i>Get going. Go.</i>

380
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:29,779
She wasn't pregnant, and
yet she was nauseous?

381
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:35,209
Yes, I didn't sleep at all last night.

382
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:39,219
I couldn't bring myself to tell
Son-in-law Lee about that.

383
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:44,600
When I saw the kids' mom like
that, I thought of Jin Young.

384
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:48,579
Aigoo, this is so worrisome.

385
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:53,079
Our Jin Young went to the hospital like
that and got diagnosed with stomach cancer.

386
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,339
<i>Don't talk like that!</i>

387
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:58,540
It's only morning and you're
already making me nervous!

388
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,179
Aren't we going to get going?

389
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:11,470
Are you... sick?

390
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,769
Me? Where?

391
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:20,169
They said yesterday... that you
threw up at the restaurant.

392
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:23,979
They also said that you had heartburn
and you couldn't digest your food well.

393
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:29,989
Oh, that. When I get stressed and
tired, I get stomach distress...

394
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:35,850
Why... didn't you tell me about that?

395
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,339
Why didn't you tell me?!

396
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:44,769
If you are sick, you should say so. I
should be the very first one you tell!

397
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:48,829
It hasn't been that long.
It was a little ache and...

398
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:51,830
What do you mean, "It wasn't that bad"?
Are you a doctor?

399
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:58,800
Why are you angry? If I got any worse, I
was just going to go to the hospital.

400
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:03,199
<i>My wife had stomach cancer.</i>

401
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:09,489
<i>We had two thirds of her stomach cut
out and we thought she could live,</i>

402
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:15,000
<i>since we said, "Let's overcome
this and have another kid."</i>

403
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,560
<i>And that's how she died.</i>

404
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:34,089
No way. It's not that at all.

405
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:38,810
How can you know that? Like I
asked before, are you a doctor?

406
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:57,209
Really? They said they would
let Jin Joo get married too?

407
00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:01,449
But I hear that the potential
In-Laws are against the marriage.

408
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:06,329
They said they would find a way. I
don't understand what they mean.

409
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:11,299
Doesn't that mean they would just forget about the means and
ways and just force her to get married? Aren't I right, honey?

410
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:16,220
Jin Joo getting married
will make us feel better.

411
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:19,999
I, too, really want things
to go well for Jin Joo.

412
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,120
But you know, we'll all be intertwined. Once she gets
married, things won't always be so quiet anymore.

413
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:30,899
Um... Mother and Father...

414
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,550
Yes?

415
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:35,649
I have something I need to tell you...

416
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,159
What is it? Tell me.

417
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:42,959
Is it okay if we go somewhere nearby for
a trip? Just for one night and two days.

418
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:48,939
Go ahead since the weather is hot.
Get some fresh breezes.

419
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:54,229
Of course! But why are you talking so carefully?
You worried we would catch on to something?

420
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:58,339
No, no. It's not that.
But anyway, thank you!

421
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,769
Where are going to go?

422
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:02,419
Somewhere in Gyeongpodae. Gangneung.

423
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:05,129
Gangneung is great, of course!

424
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:08,859
You are pregnant so go
and come back carefully.

425
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,920
Yes, Father!

426
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:15,669
Um... Mom...?

427
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,589
What is it?

428
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:22,629
I have to... go out for training too.

429
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,789
What kind of training?

430
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:30,489
Oh, Oh... A kind of support training.

431
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:31,210
Huh?

432
00:34:31,211 --> 00:34:35,579
You should go then if it has to do with
school work. How long will it take?

433
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:38,179
One... One night and two days.

434
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:41,889
Then, you should prepare.
Did you pack things?

435
00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:43,550
Yes, I did...

436
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:51,139
What? The second Hyungim couple
are going on a trip to Ganeung?

437
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:54,970
I think we should go somewhere
else, other than Ganeung.

438
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:58,549
We have to go to Ganeung though.
Where should we go?

439
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:03,899
The new Unni talked about Gyeougpo dae. There's a
hundred-percent chance that we'll run into each other.

440
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:08,869
I even lied to them saying that I have to
go on some training. I can't be caught.

441
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:13,139
Of course we can't be caught. I
even lied about going on training.

442
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:16,239
Then, then, then...

443
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,519
Then, how about Ganghwado? Since it's
not too far and I know the area.

444
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:24,509
Also, it's totally opposite
direction from Ganeung as well.

445
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:29,650
I like it. Then, let's go to Ganghwado this
time and let's go to Ganeung next time.

446
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,850
Well, that's that!

447
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:37,099
Why are you trying to
buy this type of thing?

448
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:42,529
What can we not do for our child? Teacher Kim
even bought flowers when he came to our house.

449
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:44,449
Is that the same thing?

450
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:46,109
I don't know. I don't know.

451
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,819
I'm just going to give what I give
and you just worry about the price.

452
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:51,310
Wait a minute... This...

453
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,659
Are you going to eat that, ma'am?

454
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:57,029
I'm going to give this to someone important
so be sure to wrap it up very well.

455
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,249
Yes, I understand.

456
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,979
I can eat this, right?

457
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:02,639
Yes, of course. You can eat it.

458
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,280
- Come this way please.
- Okay!

459
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,779
Honey, you buy a box for yourself.

460
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,950
Shall I?

461
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,850
Hae Seuk, the face portion is drooping.
Can you stretch it a bit?

462
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:25,479
- Like this?
- Looks good!

463

<i>Phantom Pro Kim Sang Min, One-Point Lesson</i>

464
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:33,339
The invited guests total ten.

465
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:36,739
Before it starts, we are going to receive
questions and put them all on here, and

466
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:39,379
then you can choose a few of
those questions and answer them.

467
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,489
Yes, I understand.

468
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,529
There's not much time left so go and rest.

469
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:45,080
Yes, ma'am.

470
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:55,459
Yes. Can we schedule
gastric examination today?

471
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,979
At three o'clock? Yes.

472
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,879
Ah yes, okay. The name is Ahn Mi Jung.

473
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,840
Yes, yes. Okay. Okay, I understand.
Goodbye.

474
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,620
Did you make an appointment
at the hospital?

475
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:14,899
Honey, you are doing
this because of trauma.

476
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,229
Even if it is trauma, there
is nothing I can do about it.

477
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:20,859
You didn't eat breakfast, right?
From now on, don't eat anything.

478
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:24,219
As soon as the event is over,
let's start with endoscopy.

479
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:28,310
Alright. Don't worry too much. Okay?

480
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:49,829
As you may know already, the most important
thing a about golf swing is the shoulder turn.

481
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:52,049
When you are turning
during your back swing,

482
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:54,479
you should be able to hit the golf ball
with the energy from the back swing.

483
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,739
The problem here is that your head knows
what to do but your body doesn't.

484
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:01,219
When your shoulder turn doesn't
generate enough energy,

485
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:04,559
there is a tendency to overkill
with your motor skill.

486
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:09,819
So, from here, I'll teach you how
to control your shoulder turn.

487
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:13,050
Initially, I'll demonstrate it.

488
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:23,750
So awesome!

489
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:31,419
<i>As you saw, I just showed you how you can properly
use the energy from your back shoulder swing.</i>

490
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:35,539
<i>Whatever club you may have you</i>

491
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:38,920
<i>can, from the standard position, move
it toward the right side a bit...</i>

492
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:42,240
Good job!

493
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,499
<i>Did it end now?</i>

494
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,730
<i>You worked hard. Really hard.</i>

495
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,319
You worked very hard.
You really worked hard.

496
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:55,069
Nothing at all but your participants'
knowledge was really high.

497
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:57,109
We purposely raised the standard
of the participants this time.

498
00:38:57,110 --> 00:39:02,219
Last time, a customer who had begun his lessons only
two weeks before, held Pro Choi Jin Ki for an hour!

499
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,819
It feels so horrible when I think about it.

500
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:07,639
We had such a hard time
as well as Pro Choi.

501
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,519
You really prepared a lot for today though!

502
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:14,090
You know I try hard when I have to.

503
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:18,300
What should we eat?

504
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,109
It's so nice to see you guys here!

505
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:27,879
How proud you must be to
have such an amazing son.

506
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,659
You really raised your son well.

507
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,499
Ah, thank you.

508
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:35,610
We feel the same way
about Teacher Kim, also.

509
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:44,489
Um... Did you know that Teacher Kim
comes to our house... every morning?

510
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:45,789
Excuse me?

511
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:49,040
He exercises with me in the morning.

512
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:52,079
Since when?

513
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:55,539
As you can see, he and Jin
Joo haven't broken up yet.

514
00:39:55,540 --> 00:40:00,159
Standing here, having such a long
conversation is a bit awkward, so...

515
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,659
- take this with you please.
- No, no. We can't.

516
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,650
No. Please accept it.

517
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:10,349
You know our Jin Joo got the money
for her schooling from Teacher Kim.

518
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:12,859
The two of them are close like that, but

519
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:18,039
since it's awkward for us to pay
back in money, we bought this.

520
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,969
Because it's good for health, we bought it.

521
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:23,909
Wait a minute! This is a bit...

522
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:26,929
Um. Listen. We are going to get going.

523
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:28,469
Please take care, then.

524
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:31,049
- Congratulations.
- Ah, yes.
- Congrats, again.

525
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:34,059
Ah, wait!

526
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:37,299
I really can't believe this.
Why are they doing this?

527
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,679
- Oh, my.
- Oh, yes.

528
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,320
Geeze.

529
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:46,299
Since they are In-laws of the
In-laws, I can't be harsh on them.

530
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:52,799
But... What was she talking about? Tae
Min goes to their house every morning?

531
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:58,550
Because they are also against them getting married,
he is trying to get them to change their minds.

532
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,700
Excuse me!

533
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,920
Yes, ma'am?

534
00:41:16,921 --> 00:41:19,509
Do you possibly have this in a large size?
I'm planning to give this to my mother.

535
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:22,400
Yes, we do. Just a moment.

536
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:33,599
I think this one will be a little too big for her. Can
you find me this in just a bit of a smaller size?

537
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,719
Yes, ma'am.

538
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,850
Oh! No, no. Instead of this one...

539
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,630
Give me this! In the same size too.

540
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:45,710
- Yes, just a moment.
- Okay!

Of course. Would be right for
people to change so easily?

In fact, I'm with your brother right now.

Your brother was asking with insistence, so

I explained I'm taking you down
personally to your training.

570

Yeah, yeah. Okay. Come out soon.

571
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:57,039
It's really suspicious.

572
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,089
What's suspicious?

573
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:03,500
As a matter of fact, the thought of being
apart from Yeon Doo for couple of days

574
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:07,939
makes my heart ache, so please stop.

586
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:57,349
Of course. Our Yeon Doo is going to a
training. Naturally I should be here early.

587
00:45:57,350 --> 00:46:01,979
What a relief. I was thinking we
should take her to the train station.

- No.
- Aigoo.

No matter how much I think about
it, these two are suspicious.

00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:30,859
I even rented a car. We can go anywhere.

597
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:36,139
Why? I can't tell you because
you might try to avoid us.

598
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:39,109
Ah, seriously. Hyungnim.

599
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:41,869
I'm joking, I'm joking.

600
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:45,089
Drop off Yeon Tae and then leave.

601
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:47,249
Yes, then, we'll leave first.

602
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:49,799
Let's go. We'll be late.

603
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,950
Go safely!

604
00:46:57,870 --> 00:47:01,359
No matter what, something seems fishy.

605
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:06,369
Fishy? What's fishy? We should go too.
We'll get stuck in traffic.

606
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:10,039
I think we have to go to
Gangneung another time.

607
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,159
Why?

608
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:15,949
Tomorrow's shooting was supposed to be in the
afternoon, but the schedule changed to morning.

609
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:20,139
I have to be there by 11AM, so it
would work if we wake up early.

610
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:22,269
But to do that, Gangneung is a bit far.

611
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:25,619
Then, where should we go?

612
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:31,299
What about Ganghwado Island? It's closer
and it has the ocean you want to see too.

613
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,319
Sounds good.

614
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,940
Let's go!

615
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:44,449
Your youngest brother really is
scarier than your oldest brother.

616
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:48,540
I was so surprised. I thought we would get
caught before we even left for our trip.

617
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:55,160
Anyway, the two of us are leaving for
our trip. This moment is precious.

618
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:12,319
Yes.

619
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:18,399
48:12

620
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:23,489
So we did a biopsy after
removing that area.

621
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:25,609
Biopsy?

622
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:30,949
Biopsies aren't anything new to endoscopy.

623
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:36,799
But it's true that some concerns were
raised from the shape around the area.

624
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,749
The biopsy results will
come out in three days,

625
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:44,960
so you can come back when after
receiving a call from the hospital.

626
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,439
You don't feel dizzy from anesthesia?

627
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,879
I was already all awake when we
went to the doctor's office.

628
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,949
You have less strength than I do
even though I got the checkup.

629
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:06,939
It worries me since they're doing a biopsy.

630
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:10,329
The doctor told us earlier,
it's not a big deal.

631
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:13,939
Also, it's nice to do it
if it prevents an illness.

632
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:17,380
I like this hospital
because they seem kind.

633
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:20,839
Don't worry, Honey.

634
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:25,979
Ever since I was young, I was told I look
weak, but I've never gotten seriously sick.

635
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:29,970
I had three kids, after all.

636
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:38,299
Hey, it's nice.

637
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:43,450
My little Pebble, you're excited
since we're at the ocean, right?

638
00:49:44,170 --> 00:49:48,129
I'm even more excited
than our little Pebble.

639
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:51,779
After you started filming, I
thought you'd be really busy.

640
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:55,129
Every time you spend time with
me and we go out on dates,

641
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:57,089
I'm really happy.

642
00:49:57,090 --> 00:50:02,900
There's no need to be thankful for things I
should be doing. My manners will get worse.

643
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:07,090
Right. Thank you.

644
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:13,160
This is so nice.

645
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:23,029
- Come over here.
- No, it's okay.

646
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:25,549
- Didn't I say so last time?
- The water got on me!

647
00:50:25,550 --> 00:50:28,579
- I'm good at swimming.
- Then go swim.

648
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:32,270
No... I didn't bring my swimsuit.

649
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,850
It's cold! Look at this!

650
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,980
Stay still for a second.

651
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:53,209
Lee Yeon Do. This is your first time going on
a trip with Kim Sang Min, how do you feel?

652
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:56,990
I'm not sure. I don't really know.

653
00:50:57,750 --> 00:51:00,309
What? You don't know? You don't care?

654
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:02,939
Should we go back to Seoul? Let's just go.

655
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:06,209
I like it, I like it.

656
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:09,099
How much do you like it?

657
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:11,470
I'm not sure.

658
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:17,649
My phone's okay.

659
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:21,929
Ah, seriously. Sang Min, stop filming.
I'm too embarrassed.

660
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:25,250
Why? You're so cute.

661
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:37,999
Your expression is really funny.

662
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,259
What the heck? Delete it.

663
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:42,459
- Delete it!
- Why?

664
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:44,499
Come on!

665
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:47,220
Don't!

666
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:57,049
Can you check and see if Woo Young and Soo wrote
his report on the field trip to the museum?

667
00:51:57,050 --> 00:51:59,929
Also, check to see if Bin and Woo
Ri did their summer homework.

668
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:06,589
I'll take care of it, so just go to sleep.

669
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:09,060
I am kind of sleepy.

670
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:15,399
Oh, and take the beef out of the fridge
so I can make soup in the morning.

671
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,379
I got it. I'll make it.

672
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:20,989
The soup you make isn't good.

673
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:25,160
I'll make it taste good, so don't worry.
Just rest.

674
00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:28,999
Mom.

675
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,979
Oh, Binnie, what is it?

676
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:32,839
We're not going to practice reading?

677
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:36,779
Oh, Bin. You rest. Do it with Dad.

678
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:39,460
Let's go. Let's go quickly.

679
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:45,009
I want to do it with Mom. Why can't I?

680
00:52:45,010 --> 00:52:48,079
Ah, Mom is going to sleep. Do it with me.

681
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:53,419
Why is she going to sleep without dinner?
She didn't even eat breakfast.

682
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:57,269
She got a examination earlier.

683
00:52:57,270 --> 00:53:00,429
What kind of examination? Is mom sick?

684
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:02,869
Why? Where is she sick?

685
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:05,250
What's wrong with Mom?

686
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:15,289
Aigoo. I told her to go to the hospital
earlier, but she wouldn't because she was busy.

687
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:16,709
Will she be cured quickly?

688
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:21,300
Yeah, we got the examination today so we should
get the results in the next couple days.

689
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:25,829
So today, you guys have to be quiet. Okay?

690
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:31,099
Mom has to get some rest today, that's why. Woo Young and Soo,
have you written your reports for the field trip to the museum?

691
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:33,329
I was going to ask Ahjumma
about it before I started.

692
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:34,759
I'll take care of it.
Hurry up and bring it.

693
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:38,729
No, go eat dinner. It's all done

694
00:53:38,730 --> 00:53:40,709
- Hurry up. Let's do it after dinner.
- Let's eat dinner.

695
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:42,089
Let's eat, let's eat.

696
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:43,960
Woo Joo, come here.

697
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,460
We have arrived, my dear.

698
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:12,659
It's a triplex so I was worried about finding a
vacant room but I lucked out in getting a room.

699
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:16,229
Just as if this place was
ready for us all along.

700
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:18,220
I'm so excited.

701
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:27,229
Yeon Doo, what's wrong?

702
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:28,939
This car!

703
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:30,769
What's wrong? You're scaring me!

704
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:32,679
Yeon Tae?

705
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,319
What the heck?

706
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,710
You bastard!

707
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,220
Lee Yeon Tae!

708
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:48,410
Hyungnim! What are you doing here?

709
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:53,129
I knew it. I knew something was fishy.

710
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:56,480
Hey, Lee Yeon Tae, is this
a training institute?

711
00:54:57,610 --> 00:54:59,349
What happened was...

712
00:54:59,350 --> 00:55:02,279
Hyungnim, Yeon Tae did nothing wrong. I...

713
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:03,930
Shut up!

714
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:06,730
Oh my goodness.

715
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:14,469
What's so wrong about taking a trip with my girlfriend
that I'm going to be married to soon, Hyungmin?

716
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:16,250
That's right!

717
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:21,419
Of course, it's not wrong if I don't find out
about it. But I found out about it though.

718
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:24,599
That's where it went wrong, you punk!

719
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:30,699
But are you proud of
what you did, Hyungnim?

720
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:33,890
You also did something, even
before you got married.

721
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:38,839
Anyhow, your sister here

722
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:43,319
shouldn't be repressed because I feel
that it's wrong for you to do that.

723
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:45,039
Go and ask anybody in the streets,

724
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:47,659
if they meet their little
sister at a motel like this,

725
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:50,709
how the big brother must feel.

726
00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:52,660
It would suck.

727
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:58,299
Stop it, Honey. They are here
to have a good time, you know.

728
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:03,089
Why don't we just go grill some
meat together since we're all here.

729
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:06,799
Miss, you haven't had
anything to eat yet right?

730
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:09,899
Yes, that would be nice.
What do you think, Sang Min?

731
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:13,530
If it's okay with Hyungnim.

732
00:56:14,350 --> 00:56:17,099
Alright then. Why don't we
go and drop off our stuff?

733
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:19,890
Yes, I understand, Hyungnim.

734
00:56:21,270 --> 00:56:24,399
Where are you going right now?

735
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,319
What? Our room is this way.

736
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,069
Oh, really?

737
00:56:28,070 --> 00:56:33,870
Then, you sleep with me. And Yeon
Tae can sleep with Soon Young.

738
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:49,909
Doesn't this feel like we are on a college
field trip? Isn't this quite nice?

739
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:56,579
Yes sir. If I had known this was going to happen, I could've invited Yeon Tae's
big brother and his family so this could be more like a family outing, right?

740
00:56:56,580 --> 00:57:00,039
Why are you playing along, buddy?

741
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:02,699
Hyungnim.

742
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:06,799
Don't worry about my parents.
I won't tell them anything.

743
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,969
I am a guy who's good at keeping secrets.

744
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:13,799
Yes, I'm really grateful.

745
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:19,829
By the way, you don't snore when you sleep,
right? Because I'm a sensitive sleeper.

746
00:57:19,830 --> 00:57:23,359
I sleep like a dead mouse (really
quietly), so don't worry.

747
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:26,299
I could really just die because
I'm so freaking upset you know.

748
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:28,379
Ah, it's so hot.

749
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:31,069
You're so funny.

750
00:57:31,070 --> 00:57:33,070
I don't know.

751
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:40,859
We suddenly changed our destination,
so I wonder how we met like this.

752
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:45,679
We barely made reservations
for this inn, you know.

753
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,470
Yes.

754
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:52,269
My husband can be a bit particular, right?

755
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:56,459
You could have at least told me
about it before you came here.

756
00:57:56,460 --> 00:58:00,439
I know, right? Oh, that's not true!

757
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:04,879
I think that it's meaningful that I'm
able to be here with you like this.

758
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,279
I bet that's not true.

759
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:08,720
Really.

760
00:58:11,490 --> 00:58:14,959
Here we are. Yeon Tae, you should
eat to your heart's content.

761
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,330
Okay, I'm going to eat <i>a lot</i>.

762
00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:22,290
Brother-in-law, come here and eat!

763
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:27,730
- Soon Young, this is the perfect timing, so you should eat now. Okay?
- Alright, Honey.

764
00:58:31,830 --> 00:58:33,500
Eat.

765
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:39,340
Yes, I'm coming.

766
00:58:59,010 --> 00:59:01,410
<i>Yeon Doo, are you sleeping?</i>

767
00:59:19,330 --> 00:59:20,930
Ah.

768
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:25,419
You didn't wake up because of me, right?

769
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:27,289
I couldn't sleep.

770
00:59:27,290 --> 00:59:29,079
You didn't wake up because
your brother scared you?

771
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:33,319
No. What will you do if you can't sleep?

772
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:39,549
Starting from early morning you drove us here and then you grilled the meat. And I'm
sure you're tired because you did all that. Is my second brother sleeping well?

773
00:59:39,550 --> 00:59:44,190
He said that he is a very light sleeper but
he started to snore the moment he laid down.

774
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:48,939
I feel sorry towards my
brother and his wife.

775
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:52,989
They came here for a trip.

776
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:54,909
I should've listened to you.

777
00:59:54,910 --> 00:59:56,409
What are you talking about?

778
00:59:56,410 --> 01:00:01,349
I'm talking about our trip. I think our plans
got messed up because I rushed into it.

779
01:00:01,350 --> 01:00:05,849
That's not true. My second brother is too
much when it comes to playing around, huh?

780
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:08,889
But I can understand where
he is coming from though.

781
01:00:08,890 --> 01:00:14,159
There's nothing your brother could have done if he
hadn't found out about it, like he said earlier.

782
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,190
It could have been even more strange.

783
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:19,879
What's up? You seem more
disappointed than me.

784
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:22,970
No, that's not it.

785
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:27,749
But we are here on a
trip together like this,

786
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:32,049
and we get to see the ocean together and
look at the late night sky together, too.

787
01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:34,139
I like it. I'm happy.

788
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:37,930
If I'm this happy now, how
much happier can I get?

789
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:41,780
Thank you.
