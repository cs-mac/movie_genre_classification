00:00:06,706 --> 00:00:10,733
THE BlC YCLE THlEF

2
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:16,670
Ricci?

3
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:20,570
Is Ricci there?

4
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,763
Are you deaf?
Come on! Get a move on.

5
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:54,672
And because I'm a bricklayer
I should die of hunger?

6
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,815
What do you want from me?

7
00:01:57,684 --> 00:02:00,744
Just be patient.
We'll see what we can do.

8
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:04,649
We'll try to find something.

9
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:07,015
- Ricci, you'll hang posters.
- Posters?

10
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,025
Go to the employment office.

11
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,729
They'll give you a work permit.

12
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:17,399
My God, a job!

13
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:18,935
Hey, what about us?

14
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:21,938
I've got two jobs,
but they're not for you.

15
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:24,599
Because it's not for me
I must continue to rot?

16
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,037
There's just no work
for you people!

17
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:29,340
Ricci, don't forget
to take your bicycle.

18
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:30,646
You need one.

19
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,784
It's written on the slip.

20
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:34,784
A bicycle?

21
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,650
I have one, only it's broken.

22
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:40,585
I can get it in a couple of days.

23
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,554
Well, they won't take you then.

24
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:44,427
Why not?

25
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:45,996
I'll walk for a while.

26
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:50,199
Do you have it or not?
If no, somebody else'll get the job.

27
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:51,567
I have a bicycle!

28
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:54,137
You're not the only one!
I do too.

29
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:57,906
You're a bricklayer.
That's a different category.

30
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,338
- Then change it!
- I can't.

31
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,743
Ricci, either you have
a bicycle or not.

32
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:04,777
I have it.
I'll pick it up now.

33
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:08,249
Remember: if you don't have
a bicycle, nothing doing.

34
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:12,356
I won't wait around another year.
Don't worry, I'll have the bicycle.

35
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:34,675
Maria!

36
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:46,822
What is it?

37
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:49,153
My rotten luck, that's what.

38
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,759
I found a job
and I can't take it.

39
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,331
What are you talking about?

40
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:57,264
Stop, Antonio. Tell me.

41
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:02,670
And a good city job too.

42
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,508
All right.
We'll take care of that, Antonio.

43
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:13,776
Take care of what?

44
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:15,620
I need my bicycle.

45
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,914
I must be there this morning...

46
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,320
or I lose the job.

47
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:21,619
What can I do?

48
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,968
Did you have to hock your bicycle?

49
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:31,068
What would you have eaten?

50
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,739
I've been cursed
since the day I was born!

51
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,270
I feel like a man in chains.

52
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,222
Get up!

53
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:41,573
- What are you doing?
- You can sleep without sheets, no?

54
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:59,781
They're all sheets, six of them.

55
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:01,619
They're linen and cotton.

56
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:04,296
Real good stuff.
Belonged to my dowry.

57
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:05,853
They're used.

58
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:08,533
Not all of them.
Two are new.

59
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:09,927
How many pieces?

60
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:13,004
Six. Three doubles, three singles.

61
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:19,468
- 7,000.
- 7,000?

62
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,647
Couldn't you make it a bit more?

63
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,616
They're used. They're used.

64
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:28,613
All right, take them away.

65
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:30,817
7,500.

66
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:33,989
- Name?
- Ricci.

67
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:35,592
Maria Ricci.

68
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:37,224
Valmelaina.

69
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:05,681
It's for a bicycle.

70
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:13,895
- 6,100.
- Why?

71
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,426
Interest. It's the 31st.

72
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,542
A Fides. Next to the red one.

73
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:28,236
I know, I know.

74
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,172
Wait a second.

75
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,400
Where's the man in charge?

76
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:23,933
Over there.

77
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:27,164
Put it down.
What's the matter? Are you afraid?

78
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:32,734
Put that bicycle down.

79
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,979
My name is Ricci.

80
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:41,750
The employment office
at Valmelaina sent me.

81
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:51,990
You'll start tomorrow morning.

82
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,325
Go to the storeroom.
They'll give you what you need.

83
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:07,045
Tomorrow at 6:45.

84
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:09,876
- How did it go?
- Good.

85
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,040
You had to wait,
but everything is okay.

86
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:15,315
There's some work for you.

87
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:18,650
It's the belt of my cap.
It's loose.

88
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:20,792
You have to take it in.

89
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:24,128
Come over here and have a look.

90
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,064
Everyone has his own locker.

91
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:31,403
See how big it is?

92
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:47,045
They used to give shoes also,
but the pay is still good.

93
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,050
6,000 plus an allowance
for the family.

94
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,553
And there's the overtime!

95
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:57,961
Could you stop
at Via della Paglia?

96
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,997
- What for?
- I have to pay someone a visit.

97
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,811
It's up there.

98
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:17,474
Who lives here?

99
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:19,810
I told you.
I'll only be a minute.

100
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:27,749
Hurry up!

101
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:42,536
- It's mine!
- No, it's mine!

102
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:55,646
Hello! Is anybody here?

103
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:03,059
Excuse me.
Does the Santona live here?

104
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:04,058
Santona?

105
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,390
Yes, the one that sees.

106
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,032
I don't know.

107
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:11,895
Let's try to first floor.

108
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:21,973
- Is the Santona here?
- Yes, last door.

109
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:39,056
Could you watch it
for a while?

110
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:47,333
How is he?

111
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:50,002
He's been sick over a year.

112
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:52,910
Last door.

113
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:57,047
How long has he been in bed?

114
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:58,011
Almost a year.

115
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,014
You could have brought him to me!

116
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:06,916
This one yes and this one no.

117
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:09,951
Dear God, bless me with light.

118
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:15,631
Your son will be out of bed
before the first leaf falls.

119
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,996
What do you mean
"before the first leaf falls"?

120
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:22,640
Your son will be up by autumn.

121
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:31,581
Maria, let's go.

122
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,954
- What are you doing here?
- I owe her 50 lire.

123
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:37,749
Come on, don't be stupid.

124
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:40,357
She predicted you would
get a job. You did.

125
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,993
- I want to do my duty.
- I'll tell her what I think!

126
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:49,159
How can a woman with two children
and a head on her shoulders

127
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:53,634
think about such nonsense,
such stupidity?

128
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:56,406
What are you doing now?

129
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:59,404
You must have money
to throw away.

130
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:03,008
I don't know what got
into your head.

131
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:06,150
Some woman!
Couldn't you spend it better?

132
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:08,252
Better? I'm grateful.

133
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,547
Because she's the one
that got me to job?

134
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,782
Let's go.

135
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,891
Let's go home, dumb-dumb.

136
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,563
Hurry up, Bruno.
It's almost 6:30.

137
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:30,799
I can't clean it good
because it's still dark.

138
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,954
Daddy, did you see
what they've done?

139
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,250
It's dented.

140
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:48,585
Maybe it was there.

141
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:51,160
No, it wasn't.
This is where it got hit.

142
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:54,389
Who knows
how they take care of them.

143
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,534
They don't pay for the repairs!

144
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:57,464
Shut up!

145
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,397
I'll shut up,
but I would have told them.

146
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:07,802
Is my cap ready?

147
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,342
- Something good?
- Omelet.

148
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,516
- Handsome?
- Boy, you look like a cop!

149
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:27,564
Stop it!
You're hurting me!

150
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,768
Will you behave? Stop it.
You'll wake the baby.

151
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,709
Here's the omelet.

152
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:02,828
Let's go.

153
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,585
Bye, Bruno.

154
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,160
See you tonight at 7:00.
Wait for me here.

155
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,403
Good day.

156
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:56,039
First, you give it a coat
of glue... like this.

157
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:02,786
Then you put the poster
over it like this.

158
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:08,621
Then you attach
the poster like this...

159
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:12,561
to flatten the poster
and to smooth out the lumps.

160
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:15,029
Got it? Shut up, kid!

161
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:18,131
Because if you leave any lumps...

162
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:21,999
the inspector will see them
and he'll fine you. Got it?

163
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:24,670
See, Ricci...

164
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,038
to do this job,
you've got to be very intelligent.

165
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:29,407
You must have a good eye
and work fast.

166
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:32,480
Here, it's done.

167
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:43,522
I'll see you, Ricci.
So long.

168
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:40,947
Thief! Thief!

169
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:43,152
What happened?

170
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:55,192
Get in! Get in!

171
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,267
Go after him! Quick!

172
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:02,833
Go into the tunnel!
I saw him!

173
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:06,703
Faster!

174
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,324
What is it?

175
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:26,123
I was mistaken.
I was so sure he went this way.

176
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:28,425
It turned out
to be another fellow.

177
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:52,981
Yes, there were people around.
Then I started to run.

178
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:04,822
Come over to the meeting.

179
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,258
But Capece's going.

180
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:09,798
Everything's changed.
Capece stays, and you're going.

181
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,341
Sign this.

182
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:23,003
Quadrone!
We have to go to the meeting.

183
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:28,476
You'll look for it?

184
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:30,154
Look for it yourself.

185
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:31,789
I can't look all over Rome.

186
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,981
You're the only one
who knows it.

187
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,620
I gave you the description
and the license plate.

188
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:41,390
Sure. It'll take me the whole
mobile unit to look for it.

189
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:44,463
What's the use
of my complaint, then?

190
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:48,235
Suppose you find it tomorrow
in a pawn shop.

191
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,340
You can call a policeman,
you're on file.

192
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:51,970
Anything, Captain?

193
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:53,405
Nothing. Just a bicycle.

194
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:58,406
- Then it's up to me?
- I've already told you.

195
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:01,279
You've filed a complaint.
There's nothing more I can say.

196
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:06,040
Daddy, it's 7:30.

197
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:08,344
I came by bus. Let's go.

198
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:13,988
And the bicycle?

199
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,248
Is it broken?

200
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:40,884
Yes, it's broken.

201
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:05,005
You go inside.
I'll be back later.

202
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:21,925
It's not a question
of not working.

203
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:24,823
The point is that people
are not placed.

204
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:29,660
We have talked about it
to the Department of Labor.

205
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:31,995
Nothing is resolved
with the subsidy.

206
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:34,229
The welfare check
humiliates the worker

207
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:36,737
and doesn't help things
get any better.

208
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:39,636
We need
a sociologically-oriented program.

209
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:43,508
At the meeting,
they said the same thing:

210
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:45,912
"We can't do miracles."

211
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:49,947
Will you keep quiet?

212
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,253
"You can be sure...

213
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:55,824
that we'll do our best
to get you jobs..."

214
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:57,579
I've got to speak with you.

215
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:00,188
They stole my bicycle.

216
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:03,390
Really?
Where did they steal it?

217
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:06,661
At the Florida
as I was starting work.

218
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:07,729
How could you...

219
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,558
You've got to help me, Baiocco.

220
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:14,233
I have to find that bicycle.

221
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,272
I'll help you.

222
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:21,404
Excuse me, Baiocco, listen.
We'll be here all night.

223
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:23,041
I'm listening.

224
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:29,648
Silence, everyone!

225
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:39,463
Keep rehearsing! I'm coming.

226
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:48,769
They'll sell it
at Piazza Vittorio.

227
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:51,568
They unload their stuff there
as soon as it's stolen.

228
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,745
They won't waste any time.

229
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,675
We'll go first thing tomorrow.

230
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:04,617
Is it true?

231
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:08,350
I avoided going home,
so don't start crying here.

232
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,193
I'm not crying.

233
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:13,727
But when you hear such news...

234
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:15,324
Did you do something?

235
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:16,998
Did you look for it?

236
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:21,130
Don't cry.
You look like a baby.

237
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,137
We'll find it.

238
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,741
It'll turn up in the market.

239
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:27,667
We'll examine
every bicycle in sight.

240
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:31,412
We'll bring it back.
Right, Antonio?

241
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:33,810
Tonight you
may not sleep too well...

242
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:37,750
but tomorrow the bike'll be back.
Don't worry.

243
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:49,166
Ah, no! You can't meet here!
Go back or I take my group out.

244
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:03,680
- Tomorrow, then.
- Good night.

245
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:06,350
And please... don't worry.

246
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:17,417
Give her a little gas.
We'll never leave this place.

247
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:22,953
Get that pushcart out of the way!

248
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:28,629
Meniconi and Bagonghi,
come over here.

249
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:30,462
What make was it?

250
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:33,364
A Fides. Frame number: 12033.

251
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:35,471
He knows it better than I do.

252
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:39,632
Good. So we can divide up the work.
Stolen bikes are always taken apart.

253
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:41,607
Bagonghi, let's go this way.

254
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:44,304
No, let's go this way.
It's better here.

255
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:47,815
You two look only for the tires.

256
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:49,543
You, the frames.

257
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:52,655
Bruno, the pump and the bell.
Let's go.

258
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:54,620
A Fides frame.

259
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:03,667
We'll look for it piece by piece,
then we'll put it together.

260
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:12,408
There's only vegetables here.
We're not looking for that.

261
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:22,017
Remember: don't let on
why we're here.

262
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,623
Look how many there are!

263
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:36,662
Isn't this something?
The place is loaded with bicycles.

264
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,967
Remember, Bruno, pump and bell.
That's all.

265
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:51,410
And if you see something, whistle.

266
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:58,849
Bruno, if we find it,
we'll celebrate.

267
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:02,090
Wake up, Bagonghi!
A Fides.

268
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:05,285
Hey, you want to buy or touch?

269
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:11,158
Let me work, and get off my back!

270
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:15,531
Just stop it and get lost!

271
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:21,135
It's useless to stick together.

272
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:23,399
Antonio, you look for the tires.

273
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:27,044
Bagonghi for the frame,
the kid for the pump.

274
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:28,906
I'm going on my own.

275
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:45,317
Take a look at this frame.

276
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:58,327
Well?

277
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:01,129
- What make is it?
- You're buying?

278
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:03,599
Don't touch. It's just painted.

279
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:05,639
What's the serial number?

280
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:09,370
Why? You're collecting
serial numbers?

281
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:12,916
No, he's not.
Just show him the frame number.

282
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:14,142
What if I don't?

283
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:15,785
Then I'll call a cop.

284
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:17,746
Go ahead! Call one!

285
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:24,189
You think it's stolen stuff?

286
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,919
Who says it is?

287
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:28,065
You must show the number
when you're asked to.

288
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:30,663
Do I ask for the size
of your shoes? No!

289
00:34:30,868 --> 00:34:32,631
So I won't show you
my number!

290
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:35,135
You play the lottery?

291
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:36,637
No, I don't.

292
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,637
Don't you want a bell?

293
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:41,505
You've been here half an hour
just looking.

294
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,748
How much does this bell cost?

295
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:49,180
150 lire.

296
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:55,025
He has to show you
the number.

297
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:58,651
Show him that frame.

298
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:02,194
Go ahead, look!
A man can't even work in peace!

299
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:05,901
Don't you trust me either?

300
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,774
12024.

301
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,168
Is it yours?

302
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:17,776
Here. You got paint on you.

303
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:23,276
Listen, a man who's been robbed
has the right to look.

304
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,016
You see it's my bicycle.

305
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,090
We all make mistakes.

306
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:42,399
Hey, friend!

307
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:44,234
Here we're all honest.

308
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:52,781
Come on.
Remember, a Dudes.

309
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:57,744
- Where is my son?
- Must be near the carts.

310
00:35:58,289 --> 00:35:59,654
There's nothing more here.

311
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:02,849
It's difficult. Difficult.

312
00:36:04,061 --> 00:36:05,858
Want something else?

313
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,628
I told you to stay close to me.

314
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,425
Come on.

315
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:18,167
Antonio, he'll go with you.
We'll stay here. You never know.

316
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:22,472
I say it's better here.
It's too late for the other market.

317
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,808
Come on.
Take him to the Porta Portese.

318
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:04,917
Can't win.

319
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,786
Every Sunday it rains!

320
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:12,955
Sundays I'm through at 1:00.
And where can you go?

321
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:17,396
Movies bore me.
I'm stuck at home.

322
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:18,967
Look at him!

323
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:24,134
You stupid jerk!

324
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:27,607
I ought to run him over.

325
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:30,042
They get under your car,
you don't even know it.

326
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:34,449
Look at how it's pouring.

327
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:37,377
It's hopeless.
Every Sunday, it rains.

328
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:20,313
What happened?

329
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:22,356
I fell down!

330
00:39:22,993 --> 00:39:24,551
Here, use this.

331
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,022
100 lire?

332
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:03,785
That's your split.
You're lucky to get that much.

333
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:05,222
That's all get?

334
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:15,198
It's the thief!

335
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:27,551
Stop him! Thief! Thief!

336
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:40,121
We have to find
that old man!

337
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,601
There, Daddy! There he is!

338
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:22,432
Damn it! Where did he go?

339
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:39,652
Come back, Bruno!

340
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:06,814
I found him! Come on!

341
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:21,531
Excuse me.

342
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:22,961
I want to ask you something.

343
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:26,427
That young fellow...
where can I find him?

344
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:27,799
What fellow?

345
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:30,405
The one on the bicycle.

346
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:32,138
He did something wrong?

347
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:33,776
No, nothing.

348
00:43:33,978 --> 00:43:36,173
It's a personal matter.
It's nothing urgent.

349
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:39,411
What can I do?
I don't know him.

350
00:43:39,683 --> 00:43:41,776
You were together under the arch!

351
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:45,053
Lots of people stand together.

352
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:46,915
Wait a second!

353
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:49,821
I must talk to him, understand?
Where did he go?

354
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:52,757
Please! I'm an old man.
Leave me alone!

355
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:56,330
I mind my own business.
I bother nobody.

356
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,230
And what do I get? Trouble.

357
00:44:18,355 --> 00:44:20,653
Again? You're supposed
to be here before 10:00.

358
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:22,792
Isn't the mission always open?

359
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:25,223
Come, you must get ready.

360
00:44:40,377 --> 00:44:43,574
- And the soup?
- I see you have no mess kit.

361
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:47,911
All you newcomers must bring
your mess kits out into the yard.

362
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:52,715
All right. Come, come now,
let's line up quickly.

363
00:44:57,194 --> 00:45:00,891
Let's try
to keep some order here.

364
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:13,270
Need a barber?

365
00:45:13,477 --> 00:45:14,808
Then go inside.

366
00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:25,682
Almost finished, counselor?

367
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:28,414
Almost. Just these two...

368
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:29,592
No, not me.

369
00:45:29,793 --> 00:45:31,761
We can begin, then.

370
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:42,530
Don't shave the chin.
Just the sides. I'm growing a beard.

371
00:45:42,706 --> 00:45:44,901
Please hurry, counselor!
Everyone's waiting.

372
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,736
Some job for a lawyer!

373
00:46:45,702 --> 00:46:47,169
Will you let me in?

374
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:09,523
Listen, I must find that young man.

375
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,191
I must talk to him.

376
00:47:14,765 --> 00:47:16,562
Will you tell me
where I can find him?

377
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:19,531
Listen, I don't even know
the boy you're talking about.

378
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:21,136
Why don't you leave me alone.

379
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:26,534
Page six.

380
00:47:29,813 --> 00:47:32,805
"O my Lord, we your poor souls
yearn for sanctity.

381
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:41,021
"We embrace the trials
of our lives...

382
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,625
He'll profit by it.

383
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:48,792
It involves some money.

384
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:50,591
- Where is he?
- I don't have to tell you.

385
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:53,063
Talk, or I'll get the police.

386
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:55,733
What have I done to you?
Leave me alone.

387
00:47:57,841 --> 00:47:58,739
Don't bother me.

388
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:04,579
"Send us, O Lord,
guidance from within..."

389
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:08,312
I'm sure he'll be grateful.
Just tell me.

390
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:10,751
What can you lose?

391
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:14,117
I don't expect this for nothing.
I'll pay you.

392
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:18,388
- What do we get to eat today?
- Pasta and potatoes.

393
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,824
So... will you tell me?

394
00:48:25,802 --> 00:48:28,828
Jail is worse.
You'll rot there.

395
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,231
Where is he?

396
00:48:31,441 --> 00:48:33,033
All right. Via della Campanella.

397
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:36,206
What number?

398
00:48:39,283 --> 00:48:41,410
I think it's 15.

399
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:45,013
You're coming with me.

400
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:46,883
Me? I won't go.

401
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:50,116
Either you come with me...
or I take you to the police!

402
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:56,025
Silence! Talking is disgraceful
during services.

403
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:07,866
Are you coming? Yes or no?

404
00:49:08,045 --> 00:49:11,242
Leave me alone.
I'm nothing but an old man.

405
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:12,415
What can you lose?

406
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:14,641
- I'm losing my patience!
- Lose whatever you like.

407
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:20,319
For the last time, will you go?

408
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:23,186
What do you want?
I'm not leaving this place!

409
00:49:24,661 --> 00:49:26,322
You're going with me,
you hear!

410
00:49:28,665 --> 00:49:30,633
I'm not mixed up with anybody.

411
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:37,538
Leave me alone.
I've got nothing to do with him.

412
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:40,203
Come on, let's go!

413
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:48,646
Let me have the soup first,
at least.

414
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:50,945
I'll go with you.

415
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:52,883
I'm entitled to the soup.

416
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:58,953
- Where are you going?
- To get the soup.

417
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,007
Ladies, did you see an old man?

418
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:24,414
Please attend the service.
It's too early.

419
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,157
Wait! What do you want?

420
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:36,993
- I want to get out!
- The door's closed.

421
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,532
You can't get out.
The lawyer has the key.

422
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:42,467
Stop making so much noise!
You're in a church!

423
00:50:51,782 --> 00:50:54,808
You're disturbing the service.
It's better if you just leave.

424
00:51:00,857 --> 00:51:03,018
I have to find him!

425
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:15,735
Did you come for Mass
or to make trouble?

426
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:21,667
I'm looking for an old man
who was here!

427
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,351
I've got to find him!

428
00:51:34,191 --> 00:51:36,250
You'll find him after Mass!

429
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:37,950
See, he was here!

430
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:46,397
Who knows where he's gone.

431
00:51:54,044 --> 00:51:55,841
He didn't just fly away.

432
00:51:59,683 --> 00:52:02,151
Why did you let him
go for the soup?

433
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:02,978
Shut up!

434
00:52:09,826 --> 00:52:11,157
Where are you going?

435
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:21,061
Come back here.

436
00:52:21,271 --> 00:52:23,171
Let's go! Some kid I have.
Come on, Bruno!

437
00:52:23,373 --> 00:52:24,567
Why did you hit me?

438
00:52:24,774 --> 00:52:27,174
Because you got on my nerves.
Let's go.

439
00:52:27,377 --> 00:52:29,538
Why'd you hit me like that?

440
00:52:29,713 --> 00:52:30,611
Will you come on!

441
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:40,249
You act like a father-in-law.

442
00:52:40,457 --> 00:52:41,424
Big mouth!

443
00:52:41,858 --> 00:52:43,951
I'm going to tell Mama.

444
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:46,129
In a second you'll have
more to tell her.

445
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:52,567
Wait for me by the bridge.
Just stay there.

446
00:52:56,373 --> 00:52:58,273
I'll look for the old man.

447
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:26,594
Help! A boy's drowning!

448
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:05,731
Bruno, put on your jacket.

449
00:55:29,025 --> 00:55:30,458
Tired?

450
00:55:32,295 --> 00:55:33,660
Sit for a minute.

451
00:55:33,897 --> 00:55:36,661
There isn't much we can do now.
We'll go home.

452
00:55:46,776 --> 00:55:48,073
Hurray For Modena

453
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,013
Think Modena will win today?

454
00:55:59,422 --> 00:56:00,753
Are you hungry?

455
00:56:12,068 --> 00:56:13,899
Would you like a pizza?

456
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:21,972
Let's go.

457
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:27,275
Why should I kill myself worrying
when I'll end up just as dead?

458
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:28,815
Come on.
Let's get something to eat.

459
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:53,266
Let's forget everything.
We'll get drunk!

460
00:57:01,985 --> 00:57:03,247
Half a bottle?

461
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:06,088
- A whole bottle and a pizza.
- No pizzas in this restaurant.

462
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:08,814
This is not a pizzeria.

463
00:57:09,459 --> 00:57:10,448
Give us something else.

464
00:57:16,499 --> 00:57:18,399
You want mozzarella on bread?

465
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:20,834
Two mozzarellas and a full bottle.

466
00:57:23,072 --> 00:57:26,405
We'll drink wine with our meal,
but leave room for dessert, okay?

467
00:57:54,437 --> 00:57:56,530
What's the matter? Drink.

468
00:57:59,609 --> 00:58:00,837
If Mama could see us!

469
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:07,450
We can do anything we want,
because we're both men.

470
00:58:39,048 --> 00:58:40,606
We'll eat and be happy for now.

471
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:50,788
There's a cure for everything...

472
00:58:52,262 --> 00:58:53,627
except death.

473
00:59:32,936 --> 00:59:34,801
To eat like them, you have to...

474
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:37,705
earn at least a million a month.

475
00:59:43,947 --> 00:59:45,141
Eat, eat. Don't worry.

476
00:59:47,016 --> 00:59:48,415
You like it?

477
01:00:04,067 --> 01:00:05,728
To think, if I had my bicycle...

478
01:00:06,402 --> 01:00:10,270
how much I'd earn.
We could live again.

479
01:00:11,207 --> 01:00:12,606
I figured...
I'll show you.

480
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:22,981
12,000 a month to start.

481
01:00:24,988 --> 01:00:26,819
Write it all down.

482
01:00:30,326 --> 01:00:31,293
12,000...

483
01:00:35,665 --> 01:00:37,565
2,000 overtime...

484
01:00:38,234 --> 01:00:40,134
plus the family allowance...

485
01:00:41,237 --> 01:00:43,467
which is 800 a day.

486
01:00:45,008 --> 01:00:47,636
30 times 800 makes...
Add it all up.

487
01:00:48,111 --> 01:00:49,772
Who would want more?

488
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:52,971
Am I to lose it,
lose it after one day?

489
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,178
I don't want to lose it.

490
01:00:55,385 --> 01:00:59,014
See why we must find it?
Otherwise, we don't eat.

491
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:00,453
What can we do?

492
01:01:01,424 --> 01:01:04,188
We'll go every day
to the Porta Portese.

493
01:01:04,727 --> 01:01:06,991
They've already slipped away.

494
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:15,562
Your mother and her prayers
can't help us.

495
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:18,030
Nobody can but the saints.

496
01:01:26,115 --> 01:01:29,607
...and the following soccer games
will take place as scheduled.

497
01:01:49,272 --> 01:01:51,035
Last door.

498
01:01:58,448 --> 01:02:02,851
She knows everything.
Put your faith in her power.

499
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:07,546
I only hope you're right.
Easy, easy.

500
01:02:14,997 --> 01:02:17,022
This one yes and this one no.

501
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:21,561
You must plant your seeds
in another field.

502
01:02:21,771 --> 01:02:23,671
Do you understand what I mean?

503
01:02:23,873 --> 01:02:24,931
I don't understand.

504
01:02:27,643 --> 01:02:29,668
It's simple, my boy.

505
01:02:29,879 --> 01:02:31,904
What good is planting seeds...

506
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:34,174
if the soil rejects them?

507
01:02:35,284 --> 01:02:36,808
You plant and don't gather.

508
01:02:38,054 --> 01:02:39,783
Understand?

509
01:02:42,692 --> 01:02:43,886
I haven't understood a word.

510
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:46,987
She doesn't love you!
Forget her!

511
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:52,530
Dear boy, you're very ugly.

512
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:55,559
Yes, ugly.

513
01:02:57,874 --> 01:03:00,035
There are so many other women.

514
01:03:00,243 --> 01:03:03,770
Go and plow a new field.

515
01:03:09,085 --> 01:03:10,746
Mama, the tea's getting cold.

516
01:03:17,026 --> 01:03:19,153
- Good day.
- Good day.

517
01:03:26,402 --> 01:03:30,202
Daddy, here! Look, come on!

518
01:03:36,012 --> 01:03:39,880
Excuse me, we've all been
waiting here for hours.

519
01:03:40,349 --> 01:03:41,816
Wait your turn.

520
01:03:42,018 --> 01:03:42,950
It's very important.

521
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:46,053
I'm in a hurry too,
and I came first.

522
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:48,621
Please understand, I beg of you.

523
01:03:50,359 --> 01:03:51,986
It's good.

524
01:03:55,464 --> 01:03:58,456
Look here, the lady is first,
and then me.

525
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:03,632
I shed my light on all.

526
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:05,572
This one yes... this one no.

527
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:09,903
Dear God, send me your light.

528
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:15,812
What's wrong, my son?

529
01:04:23,759 --> 01:04:24,919
They stole what?

530
01:04:25,094 --> 01:04:27,619
- My bicycle.
- Your bicycle?

531
01:04:28,397 --> 01:04:30,388
What can I tell you, my son?

532
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:33,194
The Blessed Lord
sends his light from above.

533
01:04:33,402 --> 01:04:34,733
Now listen carefully:

534
01:04:34,937 --> 01:04:38,805
unless you find it this morning,
you won't see it at all.

535
01:04:39,475 --> 01:04:43,104
Either you find it now
or you never will.

536
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:44,509
So, look.

537
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:46,443
Now? But where?

538
01:04:46,649 --> 01:04:49,550
There's no more to say.

539
01:04:49,752 --> 01:04:51,913
Try to understand me.

540
01:04:52,088 --> 01:04:54,613
Find it now or not at all.
It's that simple.

541
01:05:14,644 --> 01:05:16,202
What happened today, Adele?

542
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:18,403
My husband's still drunk.

543
01:05:18,948 --> 01:05:20,848
It's your cross to bear.
Stop giving him money.

544
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:23,484
What can I do?
He takes it.

545
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:21,441
We're closed!
The ladies are having breakfast!

546
01:06:25,081 --> 01:06:28,346
Where are you going?
And with a kid too!

547
01:06:28,517 --> 01:06:32,749
You can't go upstairs.
It's closed!

548
01:06:42,431 --> 01:06:45,161
When it's closed,
it's closed for everybody!

549
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:53,369
No one is allowed
in the dining room!

550
01:07:04,053 --> 01:07:05,543
I must talk to him.

551
01:07:05,721 --> 01:07:07,120
Me? Go ahead.

552
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:13,185
That's the dining room.
You can't stay! Get out!

553
01:07:13,396 --> 01:07:15,728
Maria, stop shouting.
I've got a headache.

554
01:07:17,633 --> 01:07:19,533
Throw him out.

555
01:07:24,073 --> 01:07:25,335
Give me my bicycle back!

556
01:07:35,284 --> 01:07:37,980
Come out in the street with me!

557
01:07:46,495 --> 01:07:50,795
This is the first house of Rome.
If the Captain finds out...

558
01:08:03,646 --> 01:08:06,080
Give me back
what you stole from me.

559
01:08:10,219 --> 01:08:11,516
What did I steal?

560
01:08:11,821 --> 01:08:12,913
The bicycle!

561
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:16,786
What bicycle? I'm no thief.

562
01:08:20,296 --> 01:08:22,890
Leave me alone
or you'll have trouble!

563
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:28,258
I'll kill you
if you don't give it back!

564
01:08:28,471 --> 01:08:29,938
Give it back! You hear me?

565
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:32,631
Look at him! He's crazy!
Leave me alone.

566
01:08:32,842 --> 01:08:34,139
Get your hands off me!

567
01:08:35,377 --> 01:08:37,208
I didn't do anything to you.

568
01:08:39,582 --> 01:08:41,743
I won't move from here
until you give it back.

569
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:46,387
You stole it at the Florida!

570
01:08:46,589 --> 01:08:48,147
I wasn't even there!

571
01:08:48,357 --> 01:08:51,121
You were there yesterday
wearing that German hat!

572
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:54,262
Get a pair of glasses.
You can't accuse people like that!

573
01:08:56,432 --> 01:08:59,458
You're not getting away with it,
understand?

574
01:08:59,668 --> 01:09:02,228
Alfredo! What is it?

575
01:09:02,438 --> 01:09:06,704
Lay off!
Yesterday I was at the fruit market.

576
01:09:16,185 --> 01:09:19,552
Excuse me.
This man here stole your bicycle?

577
01:09:19,755 --> 01:09:21,120
Yes, and I want it back.

578
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:23,155
You're sure it was this man?

579
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:24,451
I'm absolutely sure!

580
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:26,321
Where was it stolen?

581
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:29,362
- At the Florida.
- If you're so sure, get the police.

582
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:42,735
No, you're not leaving!

583
01:09:44,046 --> 01:09:48,039
Don't touch me!
Get him away from me!

584
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,755
You've been accusing a man
and you're not sure.

585
01:10:03,232 --> 01:10:06,201
Alfredo! He's trying to kill him!
Put his head down!

586
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:13,606
I think you better go!
And next time, be sure!

587
01:10:13,809 --> 01:10:17,905
You know you could be sued
for libel?

588
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:25,684
Get him out! He's a murderer!
My God, look at my son!

589
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:29,688
Alfredo, my son!
Blessed soul of your mother!

590
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:40,064
You already lost your bike, stupid!
Want to lose your wallet too?

591
01:10:42,771 --> 01:10:43,669
Stay back!

592
01:10:43,872 --> 01:10:45,635
You're all alike!
You're thieves!

593
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:52,240
- Are you crazy!
- No, just trying to cool him off!

594
01:11:02,658 --> 01:11:04,421
Where is the bicycle fellow?

595
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:08,324
There he is, putting on a show.

596
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:17,231
I said I've nothing to hide.

597
01:11:17,673 --> 01:11:20,540
You can't accuse my son!
He has a clean record!

598
01:11:20,709 --> 01:11:22,540
Everybody knows it!

599
01:11:23,512 --> 01:11:25,446
Just because he wears
a German cap.

600
01:11:25,648 --> 01:11:27,377
I should be arrested then, too.

601
01:11:28,417 --> 01:11:31,147
- Come on, get up.
- He can't be moved!

602
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:33,952
Let him rest awhile.
He's very sick, Officer.

603
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:35,750
Well, show me your house.

604
01:11:39,428 --> 01:11:42,727
We're honest people.
You can look.

605
01:11:50,005 --> 01:11:51,768
I'd sue you for slander.

606
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:54,738
Don't pick on him.
He wouldn't hurt a fly.

607
01:11:59,248 --> 01:12:03,742
One room we live in.
Look for your bicycle.

608
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:11,448
Here's his bed. You see there's
plenty of room to hide a bicycle.

609
01:12:12,027 --> 01:12:14,552
My daughter, another kid
and I sleep here.

610
01:12:19,268 --> 01:12:24,433
Instead of insults,
you should give my poor boy a job.

611
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:26,264
Bless his soul.

612
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:36,451
They're my brother-in-law's
car tires.

613
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:37,784
He used to have a car.

614
01:12:42,491 --> 01:12:44,356
Look! Look everywhere.

615
01:12:58,974 --> 01:13:00,737
Are there any witnesses?

616
01:13:00,943 --> 01:13:02,467
I'll testify myself.

617
01:13:08,817 --> 01:13:10,011
Could you wait outside?

618
01:13:13,021 --> 01:13:15,888
Talk as long as you want.
What do I care?

619
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:21,586
Are you sure it's him?
You're not mistaken?

620
01:13:21,797 --> 01:13:24,061
He's the man.

621
01:13:24,933 --> 01:13:26,127
Come here.

622
01:13:27,436 --> 01:13:28,835
Look at them.

623
01:13:35,677 --> 01:13:40,307
All those people
will testify for him.

624
01:13:40,749 --> 01:13:41,943
You're sure you saw his face?

625
01:13:42,151 --> 01:13:44,346
Yes, as he was
making off with it.

626
01:13:44,686 --> 01:13:48,747
- You saw the back of his head?
- No. His face I remember. Really.

627
01:13:51,827 --> 01:13:54,057
- Were there people who saw it?
- Yes.

628
01:13:54,296 --> 01:13:56,730
Did you get the names
of any witnesses?

629
01:13:56,932 --> 01:13:59,833
I couldn't stop to take their names.

630
01:14:00,035 --> 01:14:01,525
Then you're out of luck.

631
01:14:23,592 --> 01:14:27,824
You hardly saw his face,
and you have no witnesses.

632
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:30,430
You may be right,
but you have no proof.

633
01:14:31,166 --> 01:14:33,225
And suppose he's innocent.
Then you're in trouble.

634
01:14:33,435 --> 01:14:36,871
With these characters, you have to
find the stolen goods right on them.

635
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:38,404
If I don't get it back,
I'll break his head.

636
01:14:38,607 --> 01:14:40,507
Then I'd have to arrest you.

637
01:14:42,678 --> 01:14:45,772
If you only knew
what this means to me.

638
01:14:58,060 --> 01:14:59,925
I have nothing to hide.

639
01:15:00,095 --> 01:15:01,357
Satisfied?

640
01:15:01,563 --> 01:15:02,791
What did he find? Nothing!

641
01:15:02,998 --> 01:15:05,228
I've got a clean record.

642
01:15:05,434 --> 01:15:07,231
What's your name?

643
01:15:08,303 --> 01:15:09,998
Want to press charges?

644
01:15:10,873 --> 01:15:13,808
He's got a clean record.

645
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:24,083
Remember to send us a postcard!

646
01:15:24,286 --> 01:15:26,584
Don't forget:
stay out of the Via Panico!

647
01:15:26,788 --> 01:15:29,951
Don't ever come
around here again!

648
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:41,532
Here, take the streetcar.
Wait at Monte Sacro.

649
01:19:46,648 --> 01:19:48,240
You heard me. Go on!

650
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:23,348
Help!

651
01:20:23,685 --> 01:20:25,380
He's got my bicycle!

652
01:21:02,891 --> 01:21:05,553
Here! I'll teach you
to steal bicycles!

653
01:21:06,127 --> 01:21:08,755
Criminal! Scoundrel!

654
01:21:53,608 --> 01:21:55,838
- Where to?
- To the police station.

655
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:08,552
Wait, let him go.

656
01:22:08,857 --> 01:22:09,949
You're not filing a complaint?

657
01:22:10,292 --> 01:22:12,760
I don't want the bother.
The man has enough trouble.

658
01:22:13,862 --> 01:22:16,956
A fine example
you set for your son.

659
01:22:17,232 --> 01:22:20,963
You're lucky you got off easy.
If it had been me, you'd be in jail.

660
01:22:21,303 --> 01:22:24,067
Be thankful the man
didn't have you arrested.

661
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:30,071
And you can thank God.

662
01:23:46,955 --> 01:23:49,890
