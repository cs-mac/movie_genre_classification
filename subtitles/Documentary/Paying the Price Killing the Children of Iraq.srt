1
00:01:08,544 --> 00:01:13,466
Dear Brother,

2
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:21,765
on July 4th, 2003...

3
00:01:23,476 --> 00:01:28,063
... in Suleymaniye North-lraq
as l was on duty...

4
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:32,067
for the security of the region
with ten of my soldiers,

5
00:01:33,944 --> 00:01:36,155
the American troops,

6
00:01:36,822 --> 00:01:39,658
with whom we drank
tea and fought together,

7
00:01:40,576 --> 00:01:43,120
have ambushed
our quarters

8
00:01:44,455 --> 00:01:46,791
and pointed their
guns at us.

9
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,086
Sir, we're receiving insistent
orders not to fight.

10
00:02:32,294 --> 00:02:33,337
Give it to me.

11
00:02:35,631 --> 00:02:37,174
Sir, it's me.

12
00:02:38,634 --> 00:02:40,219
We are 11 people.

13
00:02:40,886 --> 00:02:42,680
We have a machine
gun on the roof.

14
00:02:43,514 --> 00:02:45,307
We have the firepower
to hit half the

15
00:02:45,391 --> 00:02:47,143
100 Americans and
60 local soldiers.

16
00:02:49,437 --> 00:02:51,313
They aren't intended to
make a search, sir.

17
00:02:51,313 --> 00:02:53,607
The guys we served tea
are pointing guns at us.

18
00:02:54,442 --> 00:02:58,112
lt is not against us, but
against the Turkish nation.

19
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:02,283
With my 10 soldiers,

20
00:03:02,366 --> 00:03:04,910
l'm waiting for your
orders to die, sir!

21
00:03:12,334 --> 00:03:16,589
Sir, l said l'm waiting for
your orders to die, sir!

22
00:03:39,153 --> 00:03:40,696
Put your gun
down soldier.

23
00:03:43,032 --> 00:03:44,450
Sir...

24
00:03:45,201 --> 00:03:49,246
Son, this is an order,
put your gun down!

25
00:03:57,129 --> 00:04:00,132
Search whatever you want,
and get out of here!

26
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,999
This is the smoking room.
We smoke here.

27
00:04:46,137 --> 00:04:47,721
What the?

28
00:04:54,145 --> 00:04:57,606
Major, it's not safe for
our allies outside.

29
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:00,317
You asked for permission to
search the building only.

30
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:04,155
We will not go out.
Kill us if you like.

31
00:05:05,781 --> 00:05:07,950
Don't make any mistakes
or else we'll kill you.

32
00:05:08,117 --> 00:05:10,995
My men will take you to
headquarters for questioning.

33
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,290
You mean ''interrogation.''
About what?

34
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,375
Well, you'll see.

35
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,627
That's why it's
called questioning.

36
00:05:19,295 --> 00:05:23,340
But while you're here why don't
you tell me where the C4 is?

37
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:29,597
We are soldiers.

38
00:05:30,055 --> 00:05:32,224
We are neither detainees
nor prisoners.

39
00:05:32,892 --> 00:05:35,102
Your men are not
wearing uniforms.

40
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:37,980
So it's very difficult
for us to decide

41
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,149
whether you're soldiers
or terrorists.

42
00:05:40,232 --> 00:05:42,485
We cannot know this
without questioning you.

43
00:05:42,568 --> 00:05:44,195
You're not
wearing a uniform.

44
00:05:44,403 --> 00:05:48,282
You don't have a stripe.
You have no authority.

45
00:05:48,574 --> 00:05:52,369
- You're not even a soldier!
- l used to be one.

46
00:05:53,746 --> 00:05:55,289
Arrest them!

47
00:05:56,332 --> 00:05:57,833
You have no
right to do this.

48
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:00,669
We're soldiers, don't
destroy our dignity.

49
00:06:00,836 --> 00:06:06,425
Major, these men are soldiers
and they're very proud.

50
00:06:06,592 --> 00:06:09,428
- Try not to let their
faces be seen. - Yes sir.

51
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:14,517
Turkish headquarters
have been raided.

52
00:06:16,018 --> 00:06:18,354
- Who's done it?
- Americans.

53
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:17,371
Move it!

54
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,461
Move it!
Move it faster!

55
00:07:30,968 --> 00:07:32,511
Dear Brother...

56
00:07:33,512 --> 00:07:36,140
Everyday in lraq we
asked ourselves,

57
00:07:36,348 --> 00:07:38,392
what are we
doing here?

58
00:07:39,477 --> 00:07:41,187
Than we noticed
that everyone,

59
00:07:41,437 --> 00:07:44,023
who had the power
over this region,

60
00:07:44,648 --> 00:07:47,485
has oppressed the
people of this land.

61
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:51,030
Except our ancestors.

62
00:07:52,114 --> 00:07:53,574
On that specific day,

63
00:07:53,783 --> 00:07:57,620
we have not been able
to prove ourselves

64
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,455
worthy of our ancestors.

65
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,123
We couldn't
die for justice,

66
00:08:01,332 --> 00:08:03,459
for our fight
against tyranny,

67
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:06,212
nor for our honor.

68
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:11,884
This is just what l
ask of you now.

69
00:08:12,051 --> 00:08:13,511
lronic, isn' it?

70
00:08:16,013 --> 00:08:19,517
Your brother Suleyman.

71
00:08:20,726 --> 00:08:22,478
Long live the homeland.

72
00:08:24,021 --> 00:08:28,526
VALLEY OF THE WOLVES
lRAQ

73
00:08:44,542 --> 00:08:47,711
- Where are we, Abdulhey?
- We're there.

74
00:08:48,254 --> 00:08:50,840
Where is it? l cannot
see the red carpet.

75
00:08:51,674 --> 00:08:54,844
You'll soon see the shining
red, yellow and green.

76
00:08:57,429 --> 00:08:59,140
Traffic lights, Memati.

77
00:09:19,952 --> 00:09:21,871
Shaving is masculine.

78
00:09:21,996 --> 00:09:24,582
And a beard is feminine.

79
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:27,918
No matter how
hard the beard is,

80
00:09:28,127 --> 00:09:30,004
the brush takes
all hardness away.

81
00:09:30,171 --> 00:09:33,841
First, you will nicely
soften the beard.

82
00:09:35,217 --> 00:09:36,218
Soften it...

83
00:09:36,302 --> 00:09:38,929
Soften it...
Soften it...

84
00:09:40,765 --> 00:09:43,768
- Come on in Ali.
- What're you doing?

85
00:09:43,893 --> 00:09:46,771
- Dad.
- Where's your mother? Go!

86
00:09:56,822 --> 00:09:58,824
There's a checkpoint
ahead.

87
00:10:01,952 --> 00:10:04,205
Are they policemen
or soldiers?

88
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:05,915
Police in the city,

89
00:10:06,081 --> 00:10:08,167
soldiers in the mountain,
it's the same.

90
00:10:28,145 --> 00:10:32,149
You remain captive
until you tame your ego.

91
00:10:32,358 --> 00:10:34,443
Dad...

92
00:10:46,247 --> 00:10:47,998
Leyla, my daughter...

93
00:10:48,374 --> 00:10:51,794
Don't ever remove
this until you're free.

94
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:54,004
Passports!

95
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:59,802
You too.

96
00:11:08,644 --> 00:11:10,980
Papers are okay,
everything's okay.

97
00:11:11,147 --> 00:11:12,565
Are you Kurdish?

98
00:11:12,648 --> 00:11:13,941
Yes.

99
00:11:16,235 --> 00:11:18,320
Get off, we'll
do a search.

100
00:11:19,321 --> 00:11:21,157
He says we should
get off, boss.

101
00:11:21,157 --> 00:11:23,284
Let's give him
something and go.

102
00:11:23,409 --> 00:11:25,578
We will get off then.

103
00:11:29,915 --> 00:11:31,917
Stand next to the car.

104
00:11:33,836 --> 00:11:35,880
Look inside
the car too.

105
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,339
l don't like
these guys.

106
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:40,176
Why are you
causing trouble?

107
00:11:41,093 --> 00:11:43,304
Let them do their
job, Abdulhey!

108
00:11:51,771 --> 00:11:53,272
What's your name?

109
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,525
lt's in the passport.

110
00:11:56,734 --> 00:11:58,652
l'm asking you!

111
00:11:59,445 --> 00:12:01,155
Polat Alemdar.

112
00:12:02,281 --> 00:12:03,741
What are you
here in Erbil for?

113
00:12:05,284 --> 00:12:06,952
Trade.

114
00:12:07,369 --> 00:12:08,871
What trade?

115
00:12:10,456 --> 00:12:12,124
Human trade.

116
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:16,879
l was told that these
things were cheap here!

117
00:12:17,046 --> 00:12:18,964
Lie down, we'll do
a search. Lie down!

118
00:12:19,048 --> 00:12:19,799
Lie down!
Lie down!

119
00:12:19,882 --> 00:12:20,966
What does he
say, Abdulhey?

120
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:21,926
Lie down.

121
00:12:23,344 --> 00:12:25,137
You will lie down!

122
00:12:26,055 --> 00:12:28,224
lf you're going to do it,
do it decently.

123
00:12:28,432 --> 00:12:30,893
l'm not lying down!

124
00:12:30,893 --> 00:12:32,228
Yes you will!

125
00:12:43,072 --> 00:12:44,907
Let's go.

126
00:13:14,395 --> 00:13:16,772
From now on,
this is yours.

127
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:25,573
Very nice.

128
00:13:25,781 --> 00:13:28,200
lt's from my forefathers,
very precious.

129
00:13:28,284 --> 00:13:30,119
Since Selahuddin Eyyubi,

130
00:13:30,327 --> 00:13:34,165
men of my ancestors gave
this dagger to their wives,

131
00:13:34,373 --> 00:13:37,751
for them to
protect our honor.

132
00:13:47,845 --> 00:13:50,306
My son's trust
is with me.

133
00:13:51,891 --> 00:13:54,226
My son's trust
is with me.

134
00:14:27,009 --> 00:14:28,636
ls this real?

135
00:14:28,636 --> 00:14:30,137
Of course. lt's a
thousand years old.

136
00:14:30,137 --> 00:14:33,724
Since when do men give
real gifts to women?

137
00:14:33,891 --> 00:14:36,352
Don't be jealous, none
of you are married and

138
00:14:36,352 --> 00:14:38,604
you all covet my
husband, don't you!

139
00:14:38,813 --> 00:14:40,648
l got my real gift.

140
00:14:40,815 --> 00:14:43,109
Haven't you got
anything else?

141
00:15:11,971 --> 00:15:13,973
- Selaam Alaikum.
- Alaikum Selaam.

142
00:15:14,223 --> 00:15:15,182
How are you groom?

143
00:15:15,182 --> 00:15:16,767
This is a great honor,
you're welcome.

144
00:15:16,976 --> 00:15:18,436
Come on Abu Tarik.

145
00:15:18,436 --> 00:15:22,273
l said my son is your son,
you still call him groom!

146
00:15:22,565 --> 00:15:24,233
l'm on the bride's
side today.

147
00:15:24,316 --> 00:15:26,819
Your son is my son but

148
00:15:26,986 --> 00:15:30,030
Leyla is my
beloved daughter.

149
00:15:56,182 --> 00:15:59,018
No one has opened
fire yet, sir.

150
00:15:59,643 --> 00:16:02,646
They will start firing
soon. You'll see.

151
00:16:09,361 --> 00:16:11,989
Sir, we've received the lists
from Grand Harilton.

152
00:16:11,989 --> 00:16:13,783
The vehicle is
in the hotel.

153
00:16:20,206 --> 00:16:21,582
Let's go.

154
00:16:43,687 --> 00:16:47,149
They are terrorists now!
Let's go!

155
00:16:49,068 --> 00:16:49,985
Let's go!

156
00:16:54,907 --> 00:16:58,035
Excuse me sir, the gentlemen
are from the police station.

157
00:16:58,035 --> 00:17:01,539
- They want to talk to you.
- l'm listening.

158
00:17:01,747 --> 00:17:03,415
We will go
to the station.

159
00:17:05,167 --> 00:17:07,211
Which station?

160
00:17:07,545 --> 00:17:09,713
Don't cause us
trouble, mister.

161
00:17:10,881 --> 00:17:13,300
Which country's station
are you inviting me to?

162
00:17:13,592 --> 00:17:15,428
lraqi Kurdistan.

163
00:17:21,725 --> 00:17:23,644
l don't acknowledge you.

164
00:17:24,353 --> 00:17:26,230
Let the owner of this
place come and get me.

165
00:17:27,523 --> 00:17:31,068
The building is surrounded.
You'll come with me.

166
00:17:34,613 --> 00:17:38,409
Bring me the hotel's
manager. Right now!

167
00:17:40,661 --> 00:17:47,293
Or else neither we nor
you can leave this place!

168
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,373
ls there a problem?

169
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:31,086
Who's organized
this gathering?

170
00:18:31,212 --> 00:18:32,296
lt's a wedding!

171
00:18:43,557 --> 00:18:45,643
Sorry for bothering
you, Mr...

172
00:18:45,726 --> 00:18:47,812
...Fender. Have
a seat, please...

173
00:18:47,978 --> 00:18:50,397
Look, Mr. Alemdar...

174
00:18:51,273 --> 00:18:53,692
l don't know what
the problem is,

175
00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:00,491
but certainly my hotel is
not the place to solve it.

176
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:03,994
Unfortunately, this
is the exact place.

177
00:19:04,578 --> 00:19:09,250
Please sit down and
send these men away.

178
00:19:10,042 --> 00:19:12,711
Your customers
are being disturbed.

179
00:19:19,635 --> 00:19:20,719
Let's go.

180
00:19:20,886 --> 00:19:23,597
No, not there
please, here.

181
00:19:31,564 --> 00:19:33,566
Can l ask you a
technical question?

182
00:19:35,901 --> 00:19:37,736
How many main
supporting columns

183
00:19:37,736 --> 00:19:39,530
does this
hotel have?

184
00:19:40,489 --> 00:19:43,451
- Excuse me?
- Let me explain.

185
00:19:45,453 --> 00:19:48,414
Your hotel has six main
supporting columns.

186
00:19:49,623 --> 00:19:53,544
When l blow up the
first one, we sway.

187
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:58,716
When l blow up the second,
the building starts to bend.

188
00:20:00,009 --> 00:20:02,303
With the third and
the fourth one,

189
00:20:02,511 --> 00:20:04,847
the building collapses.

190
00:20:05,055 --> 00:20:10,019
But l also installed C-4 on
the other two columns too.

191
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:11,771
Formalities, you know.

192
00:20:12,104 --> 00:20:13,939
What do you
want from me?

193
00:20:15,065 --> 00:20:19,403
First of all, l don't want
anyone to get hurt.

194
00:20:19,862 --> 00:20:22,281
Please evacuate
the hotel calmly.

195
00:20:22,281 --> 00:20:24,825
Those who're responsible
will come with us.

196
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:27,244
l take the
responsibility here.

197
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,955
Sam Marshall
is my friend.

198
00:20:30,122 --> 00:20:32,291
You can find
nothing here.

199
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:35,294
lf you must take
someone away,

200
00:20:35,377 --> 00:20:38,005
l'll bring that person to
you with my own hands.

201
00:20:38,172 --> 00:20:39,465
But that's after
the wedding.

202
00:20:39,465 --> 00:20:43,511
They'll come with us.
Right now!

203
00:20:43,761 --> 00:20:45,596
Search them all!

204
00:20:46,097 --> 00:20:48,724
l want to see
everyone's lD!

205
00:20:49,266 --> 00:20:51,102
Give it to me.

206
00:20:56,941 --> 00:20:59,110
Come on, move!

207
00:20:59,318 --> 00:21:00,319
The lD!

208
00:21:00,402 --> 00:21:02,404
Quick, quick!

209
00:21:18,712 --> 00:21:20,131
You!
Give your lD.

210
00:21:29,765 --> 00:21:31,559
Let's go!

211
00:21:35,187 --> 00:21:37,898
Please don't!
What is it you want?

212
00:21:49,326 --> 00:21:50,369
Let's go!

213
00:22:26,405 --> 00:22:29,074
Ali!

214
00:23:23,129 --> 00:23:24,797
Sayid!

215
00:24:15,681 --> 00:24:17,850
Well, the hotel's
been evacuated.

216
00:24:17,933 --> 00:24:20,352
Now, how can we
settle things with you?

217
00:24:22,104 --> 00:24:24,356
Are you trying
to reconcile,

218
00:24:24,565 --> 00:24:26,901
or are you trying
to negotiate?

219
00:24:28,444 --> 00:24:30,654
Which one
do you prefer?

220
00:24:30,654 --> 00:24:34,575
Sam William Marshall.
l want him here.

221
00:24:34,825 --> 00:24:37,912
Mr. Marshall has nothing
to do with our hotel.

222
00:24:37,995 --> 00:24:40,122
lsn't he on
your payroll?

223
00:24:40,748 --> 00:24:42,625
ls the American
capitalism

224
00:24:42,792 --> 00:24:44,627
not the patron of
American soldiers?

225
00:24:44,835 --> 00:24:46,629
Excuse me?

226
00:24:47,087 --> 00:24:49,757
Call him please.

227
00:25:00,643 --> 00:25:01,936
Hello?

228
00:25:03,979 --> 00:25:05,773
Hold on.

229
00:25:05,981 --> 00:25:07,691
l'm listening Fender.

230
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,820
We have a situation
here, Sam.

231
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:13,239
You must come
to the hotel.

232
00:25:13,364 --> 00:25:15,658
l can't. l'm going
to a party now.

233
00:25:15,741 --> 00:25:19,078
Sam, this is serious.

234
00:25:24,166 --> 00:25:25,876
Hello, Sam.

235
00:25:26,669 --> 00:25:28,420
Who is this?

236
00:25:28,587 --> 00:25:29,880
l am the one
who will blow up

237
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,632
the Grand Harilton
into pieces.

238
00:25:32,758 --> 00:25:36,011
lf, of course, you do not
honor us with your presence.

239
00:25:46,689 --> 00:25:48,732
May l have the
desserts menu?

240
00:25:49,442 --> 00:25:52,236
l've heard that American
apple pie is great.

241
00:25:52,695 --> 00:25:54,196
Am l wrong?

242
00:25:54,405 --> 00:25:56,115
May l have a
kunefa instead?

243
00:25:57,366 --> 00:25:59,285
The apple pie
you said, chief,

244
00:25:59,493 --> 00:26:01,454
is also available
at McDonald's.

245
00:26:02,163 --> 00:26:03,747
Call the bomb squad,

246
00:26:03,831 --> 00:26:06,041
and tell them the
situation at the hotel.

247
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,752
l want the bombers
to be identified.

248
00:26:08,878 --> 00:26:10,880
And call the Kurdish
leader to tell him

249
00:26:11,046 --> 00:26:14,550
we're not going to
make it tonight.

250
00:26:16,135 --> 00:26:17,636
Wait.
Wait a second!

251
00:26:23,058 --> 00:26:25,102
We did a hell of a
good job, lieutenant.

252
00:26:26,395 --> 00:26:28,230
They'll be traveling
for hours.

253
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:30,107
They will die of
suffocation in there.

254
00:26:32,735 --> 00:26:37,448
You are right!
Stop the car! Stop it!

255
00:27:10,272 --> 00:27:12,149
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

256
00:27:12,483 --> 00:27:14,276
l'm helping them breathe.

257
00:27:15,236 --> 00:27:17,404
They're not going to die
of suffocation anymore.

258
00:27:19,615 --> 00:27:21,367
These men could
be terrorists.

259
00:27:21,534 --> 00:27:24,120
But don't forget that
we're soldiers.

260
00:27:25,955 --> 00:27:27,665
Let me tell
you something!

261
00:27:30,292 --> 00:27:34,380
Don't ever talk to
me like that again.

262
00:27:34,547 --> 00:27:36,298
Do you understand?

263
00:27:36,549 --> 00:27:38,551
l'll report you.
This infamy...

264
00:27:38,634 --> 00:27:40,719
l don't care who you're
going to report me to.

265
00:27:41,846 --> 00:27:44,348
Get out of my
sight now.

266
00:27:50,604 --> 00:27:53,065
You're not going anywhere.
l'm arresting you.

267
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:24,680
Dear guests, l am sorry
to announce that

268
00:28:24,889 --> 00:28:28,142
Mr. Marshall will
not be able

269
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:32,354
to attend due to
unexpected business.

270
00:28:49,288 --> 00:28:52,374
Yes...

271
00:28:56,837 --> 00:28:59,507
This patient is going to
be in pain for a while.

272
00:29:00,758 --> 00:29:02,718
So if necessary,
give him morphine.

273
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,470
Okay sir.

274
00:29:04,637 --> 00:29:06,889
Okay, good.
Good.

275
00:31:07,718 --> 00:31:09,970
What kind of man
could do this?

276
00:31:11,347 --> 00:31:13,265
Rebels, sir!

277
00:31:19,939 --> 00:31:22,274
Stop lying to me,
and tell me the truth!

278
00:31:22,566 --> 00:31:25,277
How many times
must l tell you?

279
00:31:26,112 --> 00:31:29,782
These are human beings,
not animals!

280
00:31:29,865 --> 00:31:32,493
l hold animals in
higher regard, sir.

281
00:31:34,662 --> 00:31:38,791
lf you don't stop
killing my patients,

282
00:31:38,999 --> 00:31:41,502
l cannot remove
their organs properly.

283
00:31:42,878 --> 00:31:45,756
ln that case, believe me,
l'll kill you in your sleep!

284
00:31:53,722 --> 00:31:55,641
l'll kill you!

285
00:31:58,394 --> 00:31:59,895
God!

286
00:32:04,358 --> 00:32:06,944
Take the injured to the
infirmary right away!

287
00:32:07,528 --> 00:32:08,904
Right now!

288
00:33:21,477 --> 00:33:23,521
Let's be a little more
patient, please...

289
00:33:23,729 --> 00:33:25,356
He'll be here soon.

290
00:33:25,606 --> 00:33:26,649
l am okay.

291
00:33:26,649 --> 00:33:29,443
But what you are
doing is so wrong.

292
00:33:29,985 --> 00:33:31,445
Abdulhey!

293
00:33:31,737 --> 00:33:34,448
Mr. Fender says what
you're doing is very wrong.

294
00:33:53,384 --> 00:33:54,802
Who are you?

295
00:33:55,719 --> 00:33:59,306
- My name is Polat Alemdar.
- Are you a Turk?

296
00:33:59,473 --> 00:34:00,641
l am.

297
00:34:01,809 --> 00:34:03,769
What do you expect
to gain by this?

298
00:34:05,729 --> 00:34:08,607
Mr. Fender, we
bothered you a lot.

299
00:34:09,108 --> 00:34:11,777
You may go now.
Thank you.

300
00:34:18,284 --> 00:34:21,078
Are you aware
that you're

301
00:34:21,245 --> 00:34:23,372
getting yourself
into big trouble?

302
00:34:23,873 --> 00:34:27,501
Are you aware of the trouble
you are already in?

303
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:41,599
What do you want?

304
00:34:42,391 --> 00:34:44,435
Blow up the hotel,
if you like.

305
00:34:44,435 --> 00:34:45,644
You'll get nothing
from me.

306
00:34:45,853 --> 00:34:48,022
l don't want
anything from you.

307
00:34:48,939 --> 00:34:51,358
But you have
something to give me.

308
00:35:03,871 --> 00:35:06,081
l will slip this sack
on your head.

309
00:35:06,874 --> 00:35:09,043
The same treatment
for your men, too.

310
00:35:10,294 --> 00:35:14,882
Then all of you will leave the
hotel with your sacks on,

311
00:35:14,965 --> 00:35:18,469
journalists will
take your pictures.

312
00:35:18,886 --> 00:35:21,263
You can give me this
much, can't you?

313
00:35:22,014 --> 00:35:26,894
And in return, l'll give
you the Grand Harilton.

314
00:35:27,269 --> 00:35:28,521
Then l'll go away.

315
00:35:31,273 --> 00:35:32,191
These sacks...

316
00:35:32,191 --> 00:35:34,610
Are they the same ones
l put on your soldiers?

317
00:35:35,444 --> 00:35:37,530
Put it on your
head while you,

318
00:35:37,613 --> 00:35:39,448
still have it on
your shoulders.

319
00:35:39,532 --> 00:35:44,703
Or else l have a body bag
that'll suit you just fine!

320
00:35:44,829 --> 00:35:46,497
Look Turk!

321
00:35:47,164 --> 00:35:48,874
l've been in this
region for 15 years.

322
00:35:48,874 --> 00:35:50,292
l know Turks
very well.

323
00:35:50,292 --> 00:35:51,627
They love praising
themselves.

324
00:35:51,627 --> 00:35:54,505
You have your own rules,
your own red lines.

325
00:35:55,005 --> 00:35:57,758
You have unchanging
policies for lraq.

326
00:35:57,758 --> 00:35:59,093
You always say
that nothing

327
00:35:59,176 --> 00:36:01,303
can be done here,
if you don't want it.

328
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:02,721
Let me tell
you something,

329
00:36:02,721 --> 00:36:04,682
we've already erased
all the red lines.

330
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:06,642
We screwed your
policies for lraq.

331
00:36:06,642 --> 00:36:07,852
l don't get it.

332
00:36:07,852 --> 00:36:11,230
This doesn't bother you,
but two stupid sacks do.

333
00:36:13,983 --> 00:36:16,193
Let me tell you what you
really felt offended for.

334
00:36:16,193 --> 00:36:19,530
The US have been paying
you for the last 50 years.

335
00:36:19,864 --> 00:36:22,575
We supply even the rubber
for your underpants.

336
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:25,411
Why can't you
produce anything?

337
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:27,288
You want money
and we send it.

338
00:36:27,288 --> 00:36:30,291
ls this why you
cheat each other?

339
00:36:30,958 --> 00:36:32,668
You wanted arms,
we sent them.

340
00:36:32,668 --> 00:36:34,003
You wanted to fight,

341
00:36:34,003 --> 00:36:36,380
but you started negotiating
before sending in your troops.

342
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,507
And then again you
wanted money.

343
00:36:38,591 --> 00:36:40,801
How can you forget that
you've been begging for us

344
00:36:40,801 --> 00:36:42,344
to save you from
the communists!

345
00:36:42,428 --> 00:36:44,013
lt's obvious why
you're offended,

346
00:36:44,013 --> 00:36:46,098
we don't need
you anymore.

347
00:36:46,682 --> 00:36:49,185
l am not a political
party leader.

348
00:36:50,352 --> 00:36:53,481
Not a diplomat,
nor a soldier.

349
00:36:53,564 --> 00:36:56,192
l am a Turk, as you
pointed out very well.

350
00:36:58,903 --> 00:37:02,823
l wreak havoc
upon those who put

351
00:37:02,823 --> 00:37:04,575
a sack over a
Turk's head!

352
00:37:04,575 --> 00:37:09,330
Now, shut up
and put this on!

353
00:37:14,085 --> 00:37:20,007
Okay, blow it up. Blow
it up and see if l care!

354
00:37:21,133 --> 00:37:23,511
You ruin my sacred place,
and i ruin yours!

355
00:37:24,804 --> 00:37:27,139
You...
Wait a minute.

356
00:37:28,224 --> 00:37:30,017
Whatever, look...

357
00:37:34,396 --> 00:37:39,235
We all have
sensitive issues.

358
00:37:39,568 --> 00:37:41,153
By throwing that
sack on my face,

359
00:37:41,153 --> 00:37:42,571
you've touched a
sensitive issue of mine.

360
00:37:42,571 --> 00:37:44,657
This was not nice.

361
00:37:47,034 --> 00:37:49,120
l know what you're
sensitive to!

362
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:57,503
Bring them in!

363
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:34,123
You are a
despicable man.

364
00:38:34,206 --> 00:38:35,916
No, l love children.

365
00:38:36,041 --> 00:38:37,460
You know why?

366
00:38:37,668 --> 00:38:39,754
Because they are
fearless. Just like me.

367
00:38:39,754 --> 00:38:41,714
They're also not
afraid to die.

368
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,258
But when they grow up,
they become cowards,

369
00:38:44,467 --> 00:38:46,010
just like all sinners.

370
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:49,847
You know, sometimes, l wonder,
what the world would be like

371
00:38:49,847 --> 00:38:52,057
if we killed all the children
before they grew up?

372
00:38:52,057 --> 00:38:53,309
What do you think?

373
00:38:53,392 --> 00:38:55,603
You are already
a baby-killer!

374
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:59,607
How many kids did you kill
to get these 30 kids here?

375
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:03,986
Now you tell me that
l cannot kill them?

376
00:39:04,069 --> 00:39:05,696
Let me tell
you something.

377
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:10,785
l don't kill them!
l don't abuse them!

378
00:39:11,452 --> 00:39:14,705
lf l did that what
would be the difference

379
00:39:14,705 --> 00:39:16,123
between you
and me?

380
00:39:16,123 --> 00:39:18,501
Let me tell you
the difference.

381
00:39:18,918 --> 00:39:21,545
You cannot sacrifice
eleven of your men,

382
00:39:21,712 --> 00:39:24,757
so you sit there and watch
your country be destroyed.

383
00:39:24,882 --> 00:39:28,010
But l sacrifice 11 thousand
of my men if necessary.

384
00:39:28,552 --> 00:39:31,597
You cannot spare thirty kids
because you're emotional

385
00:39:31,597 --> 00:39:34,809
but l'd kill each one of
them for their feelings.

386
00:39:35,101 --> 00:39:37,144
l kill all who'd
destroy peace.

387
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:40,022
Unlike you, l am not
here by coincidence.

388
00:39:40,564 --> 00:39:43,067
l'm on a mission from God
to establish peace.

389
00:39:44,151 --> 00:39:46,278
He who establishes
peace is God's child.

390
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:48,739
l do not have
a child like you.

391
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:52,785
lf you'd like to push that
button, go ahead and push it.

392
00:39:58,207 --> 00:39:59,750
l'm leaving now!

393
00:40:03,754 --> 00:40:06,340
We shall meet again.

394
00:40:30,364 --> 00:40:34,285
God! Are you
okay, kids?

395
00:40:34,285 --> 00:40:37,037
Thank you, sir.

396
00:40:39,665 --> 00:40:41,459
Yes, what's
under there?

397
00:40:46,005 --> 00:40:49,717
We'll take the kids
out if you like, sir.

398
00:40:49,717 --> 00:40:51,927
lt looks like it's going
to take a while.

399
00:40:52,303 --> 00:40:53,929
Would you like to
go home, kids?

400
00:40:53,929 --> 00:40:56,098
Thank you, sir.

401
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:58,934
l think they
want to stay.

402
00:41:03,022 --> 00:41:06,025
Do me a favor and
get this table out of here!

403
00:41:09,653 --> 00:41:11,322
What did he say, boss?

404
00:41:11,572 --> 00:41:13,949
He said, he was the
son of God, Memati.

405
00:41:14,909 --> 00:41:16,535
Son of a bitch.

406
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:06,919
Be brothers, you people,
this is what our God wishes.

407
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:11,841
Everything passes away,

408
00:42:12,049 --> 00:42:16,137
and friends are the
last ones to leave you.

409
00:42:16,303 --> 00:42:20,516
To humanity,
to honesty.

410
00:42:21,016 --> 00:42:23,102
Open your heart to
humanity, to honesty.

411
00:42:23,269 --> 00:42:25,312
Don't ever
be afraid.

412
00:42:25,479 --> 00:42:34,113
Human beings are born free
with the right to live freely!

413
00:42:36,699 --> 00:42:39,368
You're wonderful,
it was great!

414
00:42:47,293 --> 00:42:49,587
Everybody, strip, now!

415
00:42:49,712 --> 00:42:52,214
l'd like to see you all
naked in one minute.

416
00:42:52,339 --> 00:42:54,425
Everyone, take
your clothes off.

417
00:42:54,592 --> 00:42:57,178
Everyone will be
stark naked.

418
00:42:57,303 --> 00:42:59,138
Now!

419
00:43:00,055 --> 00:43:03,559
Welcome to hell.
You can't survive here!

420
00:43:04,226 --> 00:43:07,938
You'll burn here
for eternity.

421
00:43:08,189 --> 00:43:10,524
You'll only find
pain here!

422
00:43:10,524 --> 00:43:12,943
Do you want to
ease your pain?

423
00:43:12,943 --> 00:43:14,570
Sorry for you terrorists.

424
00:43:14,737 --> 00:43:17,364
You ought to think about it
before you became terrorists!

425
00:43:53,984 --> 00:43:55,778
God, don't let anything
bad happen to them.

426
00:44:00,199 --> 00:44:02,451
Let them
arrive soon.

427
00:44:05,037 --> 00:44:07,456
God, don't let Abdulhey
sit on the wrong chair.

428
00:44:09,125 --> 00:44:11,919
Don't leave me alone
here in this place, God.

429
00:44:22,054 --> 00:44:23,514
lt didn't explode, Boss?

430
00:44:25,224 --> 00:44:26,559
lt did.

431
00:44:31,897 --> 00:44:34,024
Abdulhey, you weren't
clumsy as l usual l hope?

432
00:44:45,536 --> 00:44:52,418
l want to stay alive
and fight, my Sheikh.

433
00:44:54,795 --> 00:44:58,674
Only the Allah wills are
important, not yours.

434
00:45:00,551 --> 00:45:02,428
The ones who
have religious faith,

435
00:45:02,428 --> 00:45:04,513
do not lose anything
when they die.

436
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,182
However, as long as
they are alive,

437
00:45:06,265 --> 00:45:08,350
it remains unknown
what will happen.

438
00:45:08,726 --> 00:45:14,231
The only thing you can do
now is to pray for others.

439
00:45:15,107 --> 00:45:18,903
Those prayers will all come
back to you as Allah's mercy.

440
00:45:22,031 --> 00:45:23,365
Leyla?

441
00:45:25,659 --> 00:45:28,120
Allah witnessed
all that happened!

442
00:45:28,662 --> 00:45:30,581
lf only l were
killed, too.

443
00:45:32,333 --> 00:45:35,461
Stand up, my daughter!
Stand up!

444
00:46:08,369 --> 00:46:09,954
You, the groveling
cannibal...

445
00:46:09,954 --> 00:46:11,831
What are you doing?
Kissing the ground?!

446
00:46:11,831 --> 00:46:13,666
l will show you
how to pray now!

447
00:46:13,666 --> 00:46:16,085
Come on!
Hurry up!

448
00:46:16,502 --> 00:46:19,588
- Where are you taking me to?
- Go! Go!

449
00:46:21,882 --> 00:46:26,262
Don't you have fear of God?
Aren't you afraid?

450
00:46:31,016 --> 00:46:34,854
Kill these
disgusting men!

451
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:37,982
Show them what
torture means.

452
00:46:38,232 --> 00:46:43,362
...Allahu Aqbar!
...The God is the greatest!

453
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:51,912
My husband has
died for God's sake.

454
00:46:54,290 --> 00:47:00,087
lf l shed even a single tear
for him let God damn me!

455
00:47:01,922 --> 00:47:07,136
But why did they kill Ali?
Why him?

456
00:47:09,597 --> 00:47:11,849
l swear l will walk
towards them

457
00:47:12,558 --> 00:47:15,603
with bombs tied around me
to blast those murderers.

458
00:47:17,021 --> 00:47:19,607
Then they will understand
how many of them...

459
00:47:20,941 --> 00:47:29,283
...are worth of
one Leyla!

460
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:34,622
Dad, please let
me kill them all,

461
00:47:34,622 --> 00:47:36,123
together with myself.

462
00:47:36,957 --> 00:47:42,463
How can you think, l could
approve such an action?

463
00:47:43,547 --> 00:47:48,886
How could one, who has chosen
the way of Allah, wish that?

464
00:47:49,845 --> 00:47:55,392
How could one, who
comprehends lslam, desire this?

465
00:47:56,185 --> 00:47:58,813
But, what else
can l do?

466
00:47:59,063 --> 00:48:02,817
Leyla, choosing to be a
suicide bomber means

467
00:48:02,817 --> 00:48:05,861
revolting against Allah's will
in two ways by a single action.

468
00:48:05,986 --> 00:48:08,906
lt means first giving
up your hope

469
00:48:08,906 --> 00:48:10,366
and committing suicide,

470
00:48:11,158 --> 00:48:13,702
and then accepting the risk
of sacrificing innocent people

471
00:48:13,702 --> 00:48:16,247
together with
your enemy.

472
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:18,833
Can you know
how many will die,

473
00:48:18,916 --> 00:48:23,712
when you're a suicide
bomber? You can't!

474
00:48:24,338 --> 00:48:26,841
And since it not
possible to know that,

475
00:48:26,924 --> 00:48:29,927
killing innocent
people is like,

476
00:48:30,177 --> 00:48:34,557
killing the
whole humanity.

477
00:48:41,814 --> 00:48:44,942
People who instilled this idea
into the minds of Muslims,

478
00:48:44,942 --> 00:48:48,988
and recruited them as
suicide bombers are the ones

479
00:48:48,988 --> 00:48:52,116
who recreate Hasan Sabbah's
wickedness again.

480
00:48:52,324 --> 00:48:57,037
This is a sign of domesday my
daughter and is certainly evil.

481
00:48:57,913 --> 00:48:59,749
l see your grief.

482
00:48:59,749 --> 00:49:05,296
However, l feel sorry to see
your desire to be one...

483
00:49:06,172 --> 00:49:09,508
... of the suicide bombers who
make the world think that...

484
00:49:10,676 --> 00:49:12,428
... Muslims
are terrorists.

485
00:49:12,428 --> 00:49:16,348
Never forget that
Allah isn't helpless,

486
00:49:16,599 --> 00:49:18,851
my daughter; our current
helplessness and

487
00:49:18,851 --> 00:49:20,686
weakness is due to
our deviation from

488
00:49:20,686 --> 00:49:22,938
The Quran and our
Prophet's way

489
00:49:22,938 --> 00:49:28,152
and also due to our
failure to be united.

490
00:49:29,028 --> 00:49:33,866
Each suicidal act increases
this weakness and helplessness.

491
00:49:34,492 --> 00:49:36,327
That's why, our
enemies desire

492
00:49:36,494 --> 00:49:38,954
the number of such
acts to increase.

493
00:49:39,538 --> 00:49:40,998
Moreover, they may
have already organized

494
00:49:41,082 --> 00:49:43,000
these actions
themselves already.

495
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,379
Our only hope for survival
is to commit to Allah's way.

496
00:49:48,255 --> 00:49:53,636
We must to pray Allah,
in order to wite and be free.

497
00:50:50,109 --> 00:50:52,570
- Selaam Alaikum.
- Alaikum Selaam.

498
00:50:52,695 --> 00:50:54,905
Welcome, it's nice
to see you.

499
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:58,033
Hasan Agha. Here are my
comrades Polat, and Memati.

500
00:50:58,159 --> 00:50:59,660
And this is Abdulhey.

501
00:50:59,743 --> 00:51:00,828
Glad to meet you!

502
00:51:01,662 --> 00:51:03,789
He worked for Turkish
Special Forces,

503
00:51:04,165 --> 00:51:06,667
and had many assignments
out of the country.

504
00:51:07,209 --> 00:51:08,335
On his last mission,

505
00:51:08,335 --> 00:51:10,171
he had to have facial
plastic surgery to infiltrate

506
00:51:10,171 --> 00:51:15,134
the Turkish Mafia,
causing it to collapse.

507
00:51:15,718 --> 00:51:16,927
And he did it almost
single-handedly.

508
00:51:16,927 --> 00:51:18,179
What about the others?

509
00:51:18,179 --> 00:51:19,889
They are his team,
also Special Forces.

510
00:51:20,514 --> 00:51:23,434
Are they on assignment
for the government?

511
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:25,853
No, not officially.

512
00:51:25,936 --> 00:51:27,772
Of course it's
not, ''officially''.

513
00:51:27,938 --> 00:51:29,940
What is wrong
with you?

514
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,778
They allocated the
mountains to the Kurds,

515
00:51:33,986 --> 00:51:35,905
the deserts to the Arabs...

516
00:51:36,155 --> 00:51:38,449
...and the oil
to themselves.

517
00:51:39,992 --> 00:51:42,620
There's nowhere
left for us to go.

518
00:51:45,164 --> 00:51:47,249
This wasn't
planned today.

519
00:51:55,299 --> 00:51:58,719
He doesn't even let us see
each other independently.

520
00:51:59,637 --> 00:52:03,015
We've got to hold our meetings
under his supervision.

521
00:52:03,182 --> 00:52:05,768
- Do you have an
upcoming meeting? - Yes.

522
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:08,813
- Where?
- At the bazaar.

523
00:52:38,843 --> 00:52:40,719
Have you gone
out of your mind?

524
00:52:45,224 --> 00:52:47,435
l'm here to save
people's lives.

525
00:52:47,518 --> 00:52:50,020
You are trying to
save the rich!

526
00:52:51,397 --> 00:52:53,983
lf you leave me no chance l'll
report you to the authorities,

527
00:52:53,983 --> 00:52:55,234
you know l can do it.

528
00:52:55,234 --> 00:52:56,527
You are my friend,

529
00:52:56,527 --> 00:52:59,405
but we should never
forget why we are here.

530
00:52:59,405 --> 00:53:00,990
l have always
been here before,

531
00:53:01,073 --> 00:53:04,535
risking my life
for your safety.

532
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:07,455
l set the Kurds, Turks and
Arabs fighting one another.

533
00:53:07,538 --> 00:53:09,957
But you're complaining about
a cheap kidney to me.

534
00:53:10,124 --> 00:53:11,876
Are you kidding?

535
00:53:12,293 --> 00:53:14,670
How could you
be so selfish?

536
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:19,550
Could you stop putting
pressure on me?

537
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:20,843
Leave me in peace.

538
00:53:20,843 --> 00:53:22,553
Do you know how l
can hardly handle it all?

539
00:53:22,553 --> 00:53:26,348
Do you? Don't bother me
with such minor details!

540
00:53:26,682 --> 00:53:29,602
l only want your men to
behave well to the convicts.

541
00:53:30,269 --> 00:53:32,897
l need them. l don't ever
mind whom you kill.

542
00:53:33,105 --> 00:53:34,815
lt doesn't interest me
how many you kill

543
00:53:34,899 --> 00:53:36,525
or why you kill them.

544
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:38,569
l only ask you to order your
men not to shoot convicts

545
00:53:38,569 --> 00:53:42,490
on the way as long as they
bring those people to me.

546
00:53:42,698 --> 00:53:44,492
l need their
organs alive!

547
00:53:44,492 --> 00:53:47,161
OK, l'll do it. l understand.
lt's all right.

548
00:55:10,077 --> 00:55:12,037
You'll go out
sooner or later.

549
00:55:12,329 --> 00:55:14,081
Haven't you
started yet?

550
00:55:14,248 --> 00:55:16,500
How could we
before you arrive!

551
00:55:16,625 --> 00:55:18,252
Very kind of you.

552
00:55:28,596 --> 00:55:30,931
Have you found the
hotel bombers yet?

553
00:55:31,974 --> 00:55:34,268
Unfortunately not, sir.

554
00:55:34,477 --> 00:55:37,772
We're investigating the
matter to the smallest detail.

555
00:55:38,481 --> 00:55:40,357
l don't think you get me.

556
00:55:40,357 --> 00:55:44,320
l have a single aim which
is to hold lraqis together.

557
00:55:44,445 --> 00:55:46,989
And then, to form a
permanent government

558
00:55:46,989 --> 00:55:49,617
as proof of the fact that you
could all live here in peace.

559
00:55:49,909 --> 00:55:52,661
But as long as you continue
your alliance with Turks,

560
00:55:52,661 --> 00:55:55,122
and you with Arabs,
and you insist on

561
00:55:55,331 --> 00:55:58,584
establishing an independent
Kurdish state,

562
00:55:58,751 --> 00:56:01,462
peace can never be
established on this land.

563
00:56:02,004 --> 00:56:05,966
l only object to this
polarization, gentlemen.

564
00:56:06,050 --> 00:56:08,677
Can l have a cold
orange juice please?

565
00:56:09,637 --> 00:56:12,348
But you don't treat
us as equals.

566
00:56:12,431 --> 00:56:15,684
We are guilty because
we created Saddam.

567
00:56:15,684 --> 00:56:17,686
We're all
terrorists to you.

568
00:56:18,604 --> 00:56:21,690
Why are the people at the
wedding declared ''terrorists''?

569
00:56:21,899 --> 00:56:24,110
Just because they fired
through the sky?

570
00:56:24,318 --> 00:56:25,903
No! The real
reason is that

571
00:56:25,903 --> 00:56:29,031
you keep on training
terrorists and bombers.

572
00:56:56,934 --> 00:56:59,895
All right. Tell me about
your problems.

573
00:57:00,062 --> 00:57:02,189
l'll try to find
the solutions.

574
00:57:02,648 --> 00:57:05,943
Look! Our villages are not
being evacuated due to

575
00:57:05,943 --> 00:57:08,737
labour as
mentioned before.

576
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:13,617
Villager families
are systematically

577
00:57:13,784 --> 00:57:17,246
forced to migrate by
made-up excuses.

578
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:21,667
And not only ours,
but also Arab villages

579
00:57:21,751 --> 00:57:24,962
are being
evacuated, too.

580
00:57:24,962 --> 00:57:27,214
ls that true,
Abu Tarik?

581
00:57:27,423 --> 00:57:29,300
Unfortunately, yes.

582
00:57:30,050 --> 00:57:33,846
And there is only one
reason for that: Oil!

583
00:57:34,764 --> 00:57:37,266
We are being forced
out of oil sites

584
00:57:37,266 --> 00:57:39,477
in Mosul and
Kirkuk one by one.

585
00:57:39,894 --> 00:57:43,189
Oil is the greatest
value of this land.

586
00:57:43,606 --> 00:57:45,858
Don't we have
a right to it?

587
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:50,488
Of course you do! But, we
must ensure security first.

588
00:57:50,571 --> 00:57:53,449
Then we will address
economic matters.

589
00:57:53,449 --> 00:57:55,993
You can't expect me to
share this wealth among you

590
00:57:55,993 --> 00:57:58,204
in the absence
of stability.

591
00:57:58,287 --> 00:58:00,581
- How are you?
- Well, l'm fine.

592
00:58:17,264 --> 00:58:21,477
Now let's move on to concrete
demands as you wish.

593
00:58:21,477 --> 00:58:22,978
l'm listening to you.

594
00:58:23,062 --> 00:58:27,691
Unfortunately, there are
a lot of innocent Arabs

595
00:58:27,858 --> 00:58:32,696
who were arrested or taken
into police custody due to

596
00:58:32,696 --> 00:58:35,324
alleged connections to
terrorist organizations.

597
00:58:36,117 --> 00:58:40,496
There are many families who
lost their close relatives

598
00:58:40,496 --> 00:58:41,997
in these custody cases.

599
00:58:41,997 --> 00:58:44,583
l'll take care of
this personally.

600
00:58:45,126 --> 00:58:47,920
Our demand is clear
and apparent:

601
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:51,841
We want the families who
were forced out of their

602
00:58:51,841 --> 00:58:55,261
villages to come back
safe and sound.

603
00:58:55,344 --> 00:59:00,266
From now on, Kurds must also
give up treating us like a minority.

604
00:59:00,474 --> 00:59:03,269
OK. l will take care of
the migrated families.

605
00:59:03,352 --> 00:59:05,896
lf any problems exist about
their present accommodation,

606
00:59:05,896 --> 00:59:08,941
l'll do my best to
ensure their safe return.

607
00:59:11,193 --> 00:59:13,446
We need more financial
support for security and

608
00:59:13,654 --> 00:59:17,700
stability reasons, and
more educated men

609
00:59:17,867 --> 00:59:19,785
for the development
of the region!

610
00:59:20,327 --> 00:59:23,289
ln fact, there isn't a
single trainee in the ClA

611
00:59:23,289 --> 00:59:25,207
who hasn't memorized the
Kurdish translation of such

612
00:59:25,207 --> 00:59:27,209
sentences over the
last twenty years!

613
01:00:29,563 --> 01:00:30,981
Hey, Abu Ali!
Where are you going?

614
01:00:31,148 --> 01:00:32,274
To Ali.

615
01:00:32,441 --> 01:00:34,235
l beg you for God's
sake. Don't do that!

616
01:00:34,235 --> 01:00:37,071
Leyla, leave
this place.

617
01:00:37,196 --> 01:00:39,448
Please stop!
For God's sake!

618
01:00:57,049 --> 01:00:59,552
Gentlemen, thank
you very much.

619
01:01:00,302 --> 01:01:02,054
The meal
was wonderful.

620
01:01:21,699 --> 01:01:24,493
Can l speak with you for a
moment, please? Privately?

621
01:01:24,493 --> 01:01:27,163
l'd also like to speak
to you indeed.

622
01:03:19,525 --> 01:03:20,943
Thank goodness!

623
01:03:26,615 --> 01:03:28,451
Let's go!

624
01:05:53,596 --> 01:05:57,433
This may hurt a little. lf it
does, we can use morphine.

625
01:05:57,516 --> 01:06:01,979
How dare they?
lt is pure insolence.

626
01:06:04,148 --> 01:06:06,400
Considering the life
they have here,

627
01:06:07,193 --> 01:06:09,737
there are people
dying to go to heaven

628
01:06:09,904 --> 01:06:13,115
with the aim of reaching that
life of happiness beyond the veil.

629
01:06:14,784 --> 01:06:17,912
No, l don't understand
those who

630
01:06:17,912 --> 01:06:20,331
have a dream of
going to heaven,

631
01:06:20,331 --> 01:06:22,541
and yet do not embrace
our Lord, Jesus Christ.

632
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:25,586
So, you can go to
heaven, but l can't!

633
01:06:25,586 --> 01:06:27,254
ls that what
you mean?

634
01:06:27,922 --> 01:06:31,967
Christ bequeathed this
world to you when he died.

635
01:06:32,259 --> 01:06:37,348
We were chosen by him in
order to set up His kingdom.

636
01:06:39,725 --> 01:06:41,435
l've no
objection to it.

637
01:06:41,602 --> 01:06:46,148
But my folks are the only ones
who can bargain with God.

638
01:06:46,732 --> 01:06:48,859
That's why they
wouldn't leave Heaven

639
01:06:48,859 --> 01:06:51,445
to anyone else,
l suppose.

640
01:06:51,862 --> 01:06:53,114
What do you say?

641
01:06:53,114 --> 01:06:54,740
Morphine.

642
01:06:55,991 --> 01:06:59,078
Sir! One of Polat's men,
disguised as a bodyguard,

643
01:06:59,161 --> 01:07:01,247
was reported to
be at the scene.

644
01:07:02,748 --> 01:07:04,917
Well, bring that
Turkmen leader to me.

645
01:07:04,917 --> 01:07:06,794
Yes, sir!

646
01:07:32,486 --> 01:07:34,321
- Anybody coming?
- No, Boss.

647
01:07:35,281 --> 01:07:36,490
Any news from Agha?

648
01:07:36,574 --> 01:07:37,783
Thankfully, he is
good, boss.

649
01:07:37,783 --> 01:07:39,702
They took him to
hospital for examination.

650
01:07:40,828 --> 01:07:43,164
- Who was the bomber?
- We don't know, boss.

651
01:07:43,873 --> 01:07:45,833
Go and get
the news then.

652
01:07:50,004 --> 01:07:51,881
This way.

653
01:07:58,554 --> 01:08:00,890
Stop! We'll wait here.

654
01:08:04,351 --> 01:08:07,062
Don't tell anything
l haven't told.

655
01:08:07,062 --> 01:08:08,481
All right, Agha!

656
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:16,155
Hasan, you asked to
talk to me in private.

657
01:08:16,155 --> 01:08:19,492
What was it about?
Were you going to say:

658
01:08:19,658 --> 01:08:22,328
''Sam, a bomb is going to
go off in a few seconds,'' or

659
01:08:22,328 --> 01:08:27,041
was it ''Sam, the men
that l hired from Turkey will

660
01:08:27,041 --> 01:08:30,961
open fire on you and your
men after the bomb explodes''?

661
01:08:31,879 --> 01:08:33,339
Which one was it?

662
01:08:37,093 --> 01:08:38,427
Where have
you been?

663
01:08:38,427 --> 01:08:40,179
The road was
not clear, boss.

664
01:08:45,101 --> 01:08:47,019
We've got to
leave this place.

665
01:08:47,019 --> 01:08:48,270
lt is not safe.

666
01:08:48,270 --> 01:08:49,355
Agha?

667
01:08:49,814 --> 01:08:53,109
But, you are treating
us unfairly again.

668
01:08:53,317 --> 01:08:54,777
We were all there,
that is to say

669
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:57,530
we all were
in danger.

670
01:08:57,530 --> 01:09:00,574
Hasan, l'm going to
ask you one more time.

671
01:09:00,908 --> 01:09:03,828
Where is he?
Polat Alemdar?

672
01:09:04,412 --> 01:09:06,580
Polat Alemdar?

673
01:09:10,209 --> 01:09:12,336
Where is Polat Alemdar?

674
01:09:40,030 --> 01:09:41,741
Surround the house, quick!

675
01:09:53,878 --> 01:09:55,546
They are runnig
away, hurry!

676
01:10:00,551 --> 01:10:02,261
Come on, to the trucks!
Quick!

677
01:10:45,596 --> 01:10:47,139
Which direction
are we going, boss?

678
01:10:47,139 --> 01:10:49,225
We'll see, Abdulhey.

679
01:10:50,893 --> 01:10:52,770
Keep what's in the
briefcase ready.

680
01:10:52,895 --> 01:10:54,647
People live in
these houses, boss.

681
01:10:54,772 --> 01:10:56,524
l didn't mean to blow
up the houses, Erhan!

682
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:10,996
Chief, look!
Light...

683
01:11:14,667 --> 01:11:16,377
Come on,
this way.

684
01:11:21,006 --> 01:11:22,633
They're coming,
hurry up!

685
01:11:22,716 --> 01:11:25,177
What does she
say, Abdulhey?

686
01:11:45,781 --> 01:11:47,450
Get down!

687
01:12:17,772 --> 01:12:19,690
We lost track of
them here, sir.

688
01:12:20,149 --> 01:12:23,068
- Search every house.
- Yes, sir!

689
01:12:26,906 --> 01:12:28,449
You too!

690
01:12:48,302 --> 01:12:49,804
Hold on here.

691
01:12:53,516 --> 01:12:57,186
Chief, this girl isn't
trying to trap us, is she?

692
01:12:58,646 --> 01:13:00,856
Well, if it's a trap
then we will fight.

693
01:13:39,061 --> 01:13:40,688
What the hell?

694
01:13:40,980 --> 01:13:44,275
Go, go, go! Move on!
Quick!

695
01:13:45,067 --> 01:13:47,027
There is only me
and my daughter.

696
01:13:47,194 --> 01:13:49,822
What do you
want from us?

697
01:13:49,989 --> 01:13:51,532
Aren't you ashamed
for breaking into

698
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:53,451
the house of a
widow like me?

699
01:14:25,941 --> 01:14:27,443
Can l help you?

700
01:14:27,443 --> 01:14:30,196
Are you hiding anyone
in your house?

701
01:14:33,866 --> 01:14:36,535
There is no one except
my grandma and me.

702
01:14:36,535 --> 01:14:37,995
Where is
your husband?

703
01:14:39,205 --> 01:14:41,332
He is in Heaven.

704
01:14:41,457 --> 01:14:43,876
Do you know what
kills the Arabian men?

705
01:14:44,085 --> 01:14:48,255
- No. What?
- Their wives.

706
01:14:50,299 --> 01:14:52,093
All the houses
are clear.

707
01:14:53,511 --> 01:14:54,887
Let's go!

708
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:01,519
You can go to
hell for all l care.

709
01:15:10,361 --> 01:15:12,113
They have left,
come up.

710
01:15:21,705 --> 01:15:24,708
- What's your name?
- Does it matter?

711
01:15:26,877 --> 01:15:30,673
l would like to know the
name of the person l owe.

712
01:15:31,173 --> 01:15:33,759
You'll learn when
you return it.

713
01:16:28,272 --> 01:16:30,065
You have saved
our lives.

714
01:16:30,274 --> 01:16:33,986
You've welcomed
us into your home

715
01:16:34,153 --> 01:16:36,489
and showed us
great hospitality.

716
01:16:37,239 --> 01:16:39,116
But we've
got to leave.

717
01:16:39,241 --> 01:16:41,285
Americans are
everywhere.

718
01:16:41,827 --> 01:16:44,080
You have to wait
some more time.

719
01:16:44,371 --> 01:16:46,582
lf we wait for the
Americans to leave,

720
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:49,877
we grow old
here, Leyla.

721
01:16:55,257 --> 01:16:57,259
We need information
from outside

722
01:16:57,343 --> 01:16:59,136
and move accordingly.

723
01:16:59,804 --> 01:17:02,098
What information
do you need?

724
01:17:02,181 --> 01:17:03,390
Let me get it!

725
01:17:03,390 --> 01:17:05,976
No, you can't do it.

726
01:17:09,271 --> 01:17:13,859
Maybe Abdulhey can,
but they will recognize him.

727
01:17:19,323 --> 01:17:20,908
Here is the meal.

728
01:17:29,041 --> 01:17:31,419
lf you go out
with Erhan,

729
01:17:31,585 --> 01:17:33,754
will you be able to
walk around freely?

730
01:17:41,595 --> 01:17:43,055
Sir...

731
01:17:43,931 --> 01:17:45,349
Sometimes l want to
revolt against you,

732
01:17:45,349 --> 01:17:47,893
because you don't
want me by your side.

733
01:17:50,521 --> 01:17:54,775
Then l realize that my duties
to you are not complete yet.

734
01:18:03,993 --> 01:18:06,412
Blessed is the man
who endures temptation,

735
01:18:06,412 --> 01:18:08,080
or when he has
been approved,

736
01:18:08,164 --> 01:18:09,999
he will receive
the crown of life.

737
01:18:10,666 --> 01:18:11,834
May you glorify the
souls of heroes

738
01:18:11,834 --> 01:18:14,378
departed and heroes
yet to come.

739
01:18:14,670 --> 01:18:18,007
May you give us peace.
May you always guide us.

740
01:18:18,799 --> 01:18:21,677
These are sacrifices
in a high calling

741
01:18:21,844 --> 01:18:25,765
the defense of our Lord,
and the peace of the world.

742
01:18:26,182 --> 01:18:28,350
l try to fulfill my
duties to you

743
01:18:28,350 --> 01:18:31,187
with all my
might, Sir.

744
01:18:32,688 --> 01:18:35,649
This world was created
so that l might prove

745
01:18:35,649 --> 01:18:37,777
my devotion to you
through my deeds.

746
01:18:37,860 --> 01:18:39,737
Before you return
to this world

747
01:18:39,904 --> 01:18:42,156
grant me the ability to resolve
the conflict in Babylon

748
01:18:42,156 --> 01:18:44,617
as you promised
in the Holy Bible.

749
01:18:45,659 --> 01:18:48,120
And as the next generations
show their gratitude

750
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:51,332
to their heroes who
build the Kingdom of God,

751
01:18:51,332 --> 01:18:53,084
what a great honour
it would be for me,

752
01:18:53,084 --> 01:18:55,294
should they remember
me in their prayers.

753
01:18:56,087 --> 01:19:00,007
When St. Petrus left
Rome, my Lord,

754
01:19:00,007 --> 01:19:01,967
you asked him:
''Quo vadis?''...

755
01:19:02,051 --> 01:19:06,222
''Where are you going?'' This
is Babylon, my homeland.

756
01:19:06,472 --> 01:19:08,390
And you will never ask
me where l am going to.

757
01:19:08,390 --> 01:19:10,059
l promise.

758
01:19:10,810 --> 01:19:12,812
l will fade away here,

759
01:19:12,978 --> 01:19:15,189
my blood will water
the soil of this land.

760
01:19:15,314 --> 01:19:17,608
My blood will flow till
the promised day comes,

761
01:19:17,608 --> 01:19:19,360
that is till
you return,

762
01:19:19,443 --> 01:19:22,905
and that is till the
promised land is ours.

763
01:19:23,906 --> 01:19:27,701
When the promised land
is ours peace will reign.

764
01:19:28,035 --> 01:19:31,956
And the one who sets the
peace will be God's child!

765
01:19:41,966 --> 01:19:45,845
Before you all, l would like
to share a surprise that

766
01:19:46,011 --> 01:19:49,014
l am not supposed to
tell about actually.

767
01:19:49,890 --> 01:19:52,059
We can never forget
what Mr. Marshall

768
01:19:52,059 --> 01:19:54,186
did for this country,
and for us.

769
01:19:54,437 --> 01:19:58,524
As lraqis, we have
informed Baghdad

770
01:19:58,691 --> 01:20:01,402
of our gratitude
to Mr. Marshall.

771
01:20:02,111 --> 01:20:04,613
And our honorable
president has returned

772
01:20:04,613 --> 01:20:07,283
this gratitude
by a small gift.

773
01:20:07,450 --> 01:20:09,201
Mr. Marshall...

774
01:20:09,285 --> 01:20:11,078
You can call
me Sam, please.

775
01:20:11,078 --> 01:20:16,792
OK. Sam! l would like you
to accept the piano,

776
01:20:16,876 --> 01:20:21,213
which is a gift from Saddam's
palace and is currently on

777
01:20:21,213 --> 01:20:24,133
the train coming here
as an expression

778
01:20:24,133 --> 01:20:26,886
of the lraqi people's
gratitude to you.

779
01:20:30,806 --> 01:20:33,267
Thank you! Thank
you very much.

780
01:20:33,392 --> 01:20:35,686
l am honored,
honored very much.

781
01:20:38,272 --> 01:20:40,858
What's that?!
Holly smoke! Look!

782
01:20:43,778 --> 01:20:45,613
Thank you
very much.

783
01:20:45,696 --> 01:20:47,114
Hey listen! Turkmens
are done with.

784
01:20:47,114 --> 01:20:48,991
Now, it's the
Arabs' turn.

785
01:20:49,742 --> 01:20:51,786
Take a photo
of us together.

786
01:21:40,292 --> 01:21:43,629
Allah, we've heard your
call and obeyed it:

787
01:21:43,796 --> 01:21:46,215
Allah is always
victorious.

788
01:21:46,966 --> 01:21:48,884
However the
situation seems,

789
01:21:48,884 --> 01:21:52,304
whoever the winner
or the loser is,

790
01:21:52,430 --> 01:21:54,932
you are the only
victorious and

791
01:21:54,932 --> 01:21:57,268
the only sovereign
who rules it all.

792
01:21:57,726 --> 01:22:00,229
Allah, you're the
one who even let

793
01:22:00,312 --> 01:22:03,399
our Prophet Mohammed
take the test of defeat.

794
01:22:03,899 --> 01:22:06,527
You never
behave cruelly,

795
01:22:07,153 --> 01:22:10,573
we have believed in and
affirmed your clemency.

796
01:22:10,740 --> 01:22:13,117
We have
tormented ourselves

797
01:22:13,284 --> 01:22:15,995
by not uniting
in your path

798
01:22:16,162 --> 01:22:21,459
the desires of our egos,
oppressing ourselves in the end.

799
01:22:25,463 --> 01:22:27,381
Because we behaved
cruelly to each other

800
01:22:27,381 --> 01:22:29,800
now our enemy
is oppressing us.

801
01:22:30,217 --> 01:22:32,511
My Allah! Give us shelter
from the oppressors

802
01:22:32,595 --> 01:22:34,805
and from your
wrath as well.

803
01:22:35,181 --> 01:22:38,309
We have been ignorent,
have become sinners,

804
01:22:38,309 --> 01:22:41,312
then convicted, and
finally defeated.

805
01:22:44,940 --> 01:22:46,442
We weren't awoken by
the wisdom of the Quran

806
01:22:46,442 --> 01:22:48,652
and The Sunna
(Prophet's Way)...

807
01:22:48,652 --> 01:22:52,031
so you've awakened us with
the assaults of our enemies.

808
01:22:52,364 --> 01:22:54,742
Now, grant us the
ability and power...

809
01:22:54,950 --> 01:22:57,411
...to repel
these assaults,

810
01:22:57,495 --> 01:23:00,539
and confer us
conscious patience

811
01:23:00,539 --> 01:23:02,666
and perseverance,
my Allah.

812
01:23:03,709 --> 01:23:07,421
Allah! ln reverence to
our blessed Prophet

813
01:23:07,505 --> 01:23:09,924
who brought us the
religion of peace, lslam,

814
01:23:09,924 --> 01:23:12,259
do not let us abandon
his jurisprudence

815
01:23:12,259 --> 01:23:14,386
and morals that
he remained

816
01:23:14,553 --> 01:23:16,597
true with utmost
care even in times

817
01:23:16,597 --> 01:23:19,058
when he had no
choice but to fight.

818
01:25:51,961 --> 01:25:54,422
Tell them that
we have guests.

819
01:26:27,037 --> 01:26:28,622
You must
not sit here.

820
01:26:31,751 --> 01:26:33,711
lt's not safe.

821
01:26:35,963 --> 01:26:38,674
You can be spotted.

822
01:26:39,341 --> 01:26:41,844
l am stuck in here
because of Sam.

823
01:26:43,095 --> 01:26:47,475
He is oppressing people
and l can't do anything!

824
01:26:48,642 --> 01:26:50,770
Sam is doing
nothing new.

825
01:26:51,771 --> 01:26:54,106
His oppression has
nothing to do with you!

826
01:26:57,860 --> 01:27:00,696
Nobody could want him
killed more than me!

827
01:27:02,782 --> 01:27:05,910
However, we have no choice,
but to show patience.

828
01:27:07,661 --> 01:27:09,955
How did you learn
to be that patient?

829
01:27:12,917 --> 01:27:17,254
The life has taught me the
unbearable part of patience;

830
01:27:19,006 --> 01:27:24,178
and my Sheikh taught me
the bearable part of it.

831
01:27:24,845 --> 01:27:26,305
Sheikh?

832
01:27:28,057 --> 01:27:33,604
Abdurrahman Halis Kerkuki.
He brought me up.

833
01:27:34,355 --> 01:27:36,899
What about
your parents?

834
01:27:39,235 --> 01:27:41,237
l have never
seen my father.

835
01:27:42,738 --> 01:27:43,989
And, when my
mother died,

836
01:27:44,073 --> 01:27:46,075
l was too young
to remember anything.

837
01:27:48,869 --> 01:27:50,788
He brought me
up just as he did

838
01:27:51,997 --> 01:27:55,418
all the orphans
and the homeless.

839
01:28:13,018 --> 01:28:15,896
What is your greatest
ambition in life, Leyla?

840
01:28:16,897 --> 01:28:19,900
Before, l had
only one dream:

841
01:28:22,945 --> 01:28:28,617
l used to close my
eyes, and imagined

842
01:28:28,784 --> 01:28:32,455
breathing my last
breath in this land

843
01:28:32,580 --> 01:28:35,166
while staring
at the stars.

844
01:28:36,208 --> 01:28:38,252
That was my
only dream then.

845
01:28:40,379 --> 01:28:42,047
Now?

846
01:28:43,215 --> 01:28:47,052
Now, my only desire is
to stab this dagger...

847
01:28:49,722 --> 01:28:54,351
... into that
scoundrel's heart.

848
01:28:56,020 --> 01:29:01,108
Only then will l be
able to understand...

849
01:29:02,485 --> 01:29:06,197
... if he's also got
a heart or not.

850
01:29:07,114 --> 01:29:09,617
And then l can
die in peace.

851
01:29:16,290 --> 01:29:19,710
lf l prevent you from
realizing this desire...

852
01:29:20,878 --> 01:29:22,713
... will you be
angry with me?

853
01:29:34,266 --> 01:29:37,019
Chief, how will we
get on a moving train?

854
01:29:39,271 --> 01:29:41,315
When it slows down
we'll jump on, Memati.

855
01:29:43,442 --> 01:29:45,778
ls there nobody in
charge of the piano?

856
01:29:47,113 --> 01:29:49,156
lf there is, we'll
shoot him down.

857
01:29:50,449 --> 01:29:52,159
What about the
gun's noise?

858
01:29:53,536 --> 01:29:56,122
Then we will not shoot him,
but throw him off the train.

859
01:29:56,747 --> 01:29:59,375
No, we can't! They
would realize it then.

860
01:30:02,002 --> 01:30:05,881
- Hopefully nobody is there.
- lf God wills!

861
01:30:10,594 --> 01:30:11,720
lt's coming.

862
01:31:13,074 --> 01:31:15,326
Keep a protective
eye on our visitors.

863
01:31:15,659 --> 01:31:18,245
Don't get distressed
over the high number

864
01:31:18,454 --> 01:31:21,040
of requests and complaints,
,and don't get annoyed.

865
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:22,917
lt's neither your,
nor my home.

866
01:31:22,917 --> 01:31:25,294
But belongs
to the homeless.

867
01:31:25,294 --> 01:31:27,129
All right,
Sheikh!

868
01:31:34,136 --> 01:31:36,055
Remember...

869
01:31:36,555 --> 01:31:41,560
Patience doesn't mean
to bow, but to struggle!

870
01:31:52,363 --> 01:31:54,532
l'm sick of this Sheikh.

871
01:31:54,657 --> 01:31:57,576
The Turkmens, the Arabs they
all go to him to ask for help.

872
01:31:57,576 --> 01:31:59,787
And his closest
men are Kurds!

873
01:31:59,787 --> 01:32:01,622
Who is this Sheikh,
for God's sake?

874
01:32:01,789 --> 01:32:03,791
He descended
from the Prophet.

875
01:32:04,125 --> 01:32:06,043
All people
respect him.

876
01:32:06,043 --> 01:32:07,503
l don't care about
his descendance.

877
01:32:07,586 --> 01:32:10,214
lf he is trying to spoil
all that l had done here,

878
01:32:10,214 --> 01:32:12,466
then he is the chief
of terrorists to me!

879
01:32:12,716 --> 01:32:14,927
Please don't
say so, sir...

880
01:32:15,594 --> 01:32:19,390
lf Abdurrahman Halis
Kerkuki weren't here,

881
01:32:19,390 --> 01:32:21,851
who would look after the
orphans and the widows?

882
01:32:21,934 --> 01:32:24,979
Who would help the
unemployed, helpless people?

883
01:32:24,979 --> 01:32:28,023
Then everyone
would be terrorists.

884
01:32:28,691 --> 01:32:30,526
lf he is that good,

885
01:32:30,526 --> 01:32:32,695
then he shall be the
president of lraq!

886
01:32:32,862 --> 01:32:34,572
l have been telling
you for years that

887
01:32:34,572 --> 01:32:35,448
this man is dangerous.

888
01:32:35,448 --> 01:32:37,408
But you have always
defended him!

889
01:32:37,491 --> 01:32:38,868
Now tell me: Who
do you side with?

890
01:32:38,868 --> 01:32:40,911
Me or him?

891
01:32:41,078 --> 01:32:42,955
What do you
benefit from him?

892
01:32:43,622 --> 01:32:46,333
l don't benefit
from anybody!

893
01:32:47,126 --> 01:32:48,544
Get your men
ready, now.

894
01:32:48,753 --> 01:32:50,379
The Sheikh will
be arrested.

895
01:32:50,379 --> 01:32:52,089
Yes sir!

896
01:32:53,048 --> 01:32:55,468
l am not going to
take part in this, sir!

897
01:32:57,052 --> 01:32:58,971
Excuse me?
l can't hear you.

898
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:01,640
Speak slowly!

899
01:33:02,850 --> 01:33:06,145
My father, my grandfather
and his father,

900
01:33:06,312 --> 01:33:13,110
even my grandfather's
grandfather got our bread there.

901
01:33:13,819 --> 01:33:16,363
He freed us from the
tyranny of Saddam.

902
01:33:16,489 --> 01:33:20,826
l can't point
a gun at him.

903
01:33:21,202 --> 01:33:22,912
He would
paralyze us!

904
01:33:23,370 --> 01:33:25,164
Paralyze you?

905
01:33:25,581 --> 01:33:27,458
You mean this
man is a wizard?

906
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:32,838
No, no sir. You know
nothing about him.

907
01:33:34,006 --> 01:33:36,801
l've learnt enough.
Thank you.

908
01:33:36,801 --> 01:33:38,677
l think this
meeting is over.

909
01:34:18,884 --> 01:34:21,554
We would like
everyone to see,

910
01:34:21,637 --> 01:34:23,764
what happens in the end to
the American occupiers of lraq.

911
01:34:23,764 --> 01:34:28,769
Unless the Americans, Brits,
and Jews go away from lraq,

912
01:34:28,769 --> 01:34:31,814
we'll behead them
all one by one.

913
01:34:32,898 --> 01:34:37,945
Lord, please save me.
l don't want to be killed!

914
01:35:06,015 --> 01:35:07,808
What are you
doing here?

915
01:35:10,895 --> 01:35:14,690
Whom are you
imitating? Whom?

916
01:35:15,816 --> 01:35:17,401
Are you trying to act
like the puppets

917
01:35:17,401 --> 01:35:19,320
who work for
those oppressors?

918
01:35:20,154 --> 01:35:21,989
Our Prophet never
committed such acts.

919
01:35:21,989 --> 01:35:24,784
Then who taught
you about this?

920
01:35:26,368 --> 01:35:28,329
This guy is a henchman
of those murderers,

921
01:35:28,412 --> 01:35:30,456
he is a journalist.
He is not innocent!

922
01:35:30,664 --> 01:35:33,417
What?
Are you Allah...

923
01:35:34,752 --> 01:35:37,671
... to know who is
innocent and who is not?

924
01:35:56,190 --> 01:36:01,570
He may be cruel could
be a liar as well.

925
01:36:02,696 --> 01:36:06,033
lf your heads are
to be chopped off,

926
01:36:06,242 --> 01:36:08,035
he might even
say that

927
01:36:08,202 --> 01:36:10,079
''Muslims are butchering
each other'',

928
01:36:10,079 --> 01:36:13,165
while taking your photographs
with a great enthusiasm.

929
01:36:13,833 --> 01:36:18,170
But how can you
regard such cruel things

930
01:36:18,337 --> 01:36:21,090
as suitable for
you? How?

931
01:36:22,550 --> 01:36:25,594
Stand up.
Stand up!

932
01:36:28,556 --> 01:36:31,434
Take this.

933
01:36:34,353 --> 01:36:35,813
Behead him.

934
01:36:38,441 --> 01:36:39,734
Chop his head off!

935
01:36:39,734 --> 01:36:42,278
Do whatever your heart
tells you. Come on!

936
01:36:52,204 --> 01:36:58,043
l'm just a journalist.
Do you understand?

937
01:37:04,884 --> 01:37:06,385
Thank you.

938
01:37:08,304 --> 01:37:10,347
Thank you
very much.

939
01:37:39,335 --> 01:37:41,796
Darling, you are
mine at last.

940
01:37:59,480 --> 01:38:01,440
You should
be proud.

941
01:38:13,285 --> 01:38:15,371
Groveling bastards!

942
01:38:24,630 --> 01:38:27,716
What's that noise!
Will you stop that please?

943
01:38:31,262 --> 01:38:34,640
l don't want any noise.
Thank you!

944
01:38:35,099 --> 01:38:37,101
l'm trying to do
some practice.

945
01:38:55,786 --> 01:38:59,498
Stop playing football,
today is our lucky day.

946
01:39:00,124 --> 01:39:01,834
lt's eid!

947
01:39:10,468 --> 01:39:12,136
You should
have seen it.

948
01:39:12,136 --> 01:39:14,555
That murderer's house
has collapsed on him!

949
01:39:15,556 --> 01:39:18,017
The house has
come down on him.

950
01:39:18,309 --> 01:39:20,352
God!
Thank goodness!

951
01:39:20,519 --> 01:39:22,229
What does she
say Abdulhey?

952
01:39:22,354 --> 01:39:24,148
Sam was killed.

953
01:39:25,357 --> 01:39:27,109
ls that true, chief?

954
01:39:36,869 --> 01:39:38,454
You gotta leave
this place.

955
01:39:38,454 --> 01:39:40,372
l'm not going
anywhere!

956
01:39:40,748 --> 01:39:43,501
He is dead now.
What's he going to do?

957
01:39:43,751 --> 01:39:46,170
Can his filthy soul
disturb me?

958
01:39:47,546 --> 01:39:51,425
Leyla, the hardest
times are yet to come.

959
01:39:52,176 --> 01:39:54,178
The superceding
officer might find out

960
01:39:54,386 --> 01:39:56,680
that you have gotten
in touch with us.

961
01:39:56,847 --> 01:39:58,599
How can he?

962
01:39:58,599 --> 01:40:02,186
Leyla, somebody must have
seen you and Erhan together.

963
01:40:05,856 --> 01:40:08,275
Are you still
sitting here,

964
01:40:08,275 --> 01:40:09,777
while the kids
are chanting,

965
01:40:09,860 --> 01:40:11,695
Turkey is proud of you
outside screaming.

966
01:40:11,695 --> 01:40:13,739
Don't interrupt Erhan,
we are talking.

967
01:40:15,157 --> 01:40:17,118
You don't even understand
what they say.

968
01:40:25,418 --> 01:40:27,294
Will you be safe
with the Sheikh?

969
01:40:27,378 --> 01:40:28,879
Why?

970
01:40:32,383 --> 01:40:34,135
l'll notify
our neighbours.

971
01:40:34,135 --> 01:40:36,178
They were going to
send us a food supply.

972
01:40:36,262 --> 01:40:37,972
Stop, mother!

973
01:40:38,055 --> 01:40:39,473
Abdulhey...

974
01:40:40,975 --> 01:40:43,102
We've got to be
sure he is dead.

975
01:40:43,936 --> 01:40:45,980
Disguise yourself
and go downtown.

976
01:40:45,980 --> 01:40:47,523
And find a
vehicle for us.

977
01:41:20,389 --> 01:41:22,266
Are you proud
of Turkey?

978
01:41:26,312 --> 01:41:28,481
Are you proud?

979
01:41:58,636 --> 01:42:00,304
Erhan, get the supplies
off the vehicle.

980
01:42:00,304 --> 01:42:01,806
All right, boss!

981
01:42:04,934 --> 01:42:06,644
You can have a rest.

982
01:42:14,443 --> 01:42:16,612
Does your Sheikh come
for the morning prayer?

983
01:42:16,695 --> 01:42:19,532
- Certainly, he does.
- Okay.

984
01:42:33,504 --> 01:42:36,340
- l'll wash my face there.
- All right.

985
01:42:44,682 --> 01:42:48,561
- Selaam Alaikum.
- Alaikum Selaam.

986
01:42:49,645 --> 01:42:51,188
Where from?

987
01:42:51,564 --> 01:42:54,859
- From the city.
- Mashallah.

988
01:42:55,443 --> 01:42:57,194
Who is your family?

989
01:42:57,820 --> 01:43:01,657
- l am from Turkey.
- Turkey! Mashallah!

990
01:43:02,450 --> 01:43:07,329
Allahu Aqbar,
Allahu Aqbar!

991
01:43:13,919 --> 01:43:15,504
What does the
Hodja say?

992
01:43:16,088 --> 01:43:18,382
He says God is
great, Abdulhey.

993
01:43:19,258 --> 01:43:20,468
And he adds that,

994
01:43:20,468 --> 01:43:23,220
we will still have a
journey back to lstanbul!

995
01:43:30,519 --> 01:43:32,813
My woman died, and
l get older each day.

996
01:43:33,856 --> 01:43:36,817
Let's marry you off
with a Turkish bride.

997
01:43:36,817 --> 01:43:39,487
Our Sheikh
wouldn't allow it.

998
01:43:41,489 --> 01:43:43,199
What is your name?

999
01:43:43,616 --> 01:43:46,494
Peko Hüseyin.

1000
01:43:56,837 --> 01:43:59,799
Only Allah knows, who
will live, who will die!

1001
01:44:17,483 --> 01:44:19,193
Boss!

1002
01:44:20,569 --> 01:44:22,905
Take the briefcase
and leave the car.

1003
01:44:41,424 --> 01:44:43,175
They will not get
out of this village!

1004
01:44:43,175 --> 01:44:44,718
Burn every building
to kill them.

1005
01:44:44,718 --> 01:44:45,803
Yes sir!

1006
01:44:47,555 --> 01:44:49,098
Run!

1007
01:45:04,447 --> 01:45:05,823
Are you all OK?

1008
01:45:07,783 --> 01:45:09,493
We are fine, chief.

1009
01:45:09,618 --> 01:45:11,412
Give me a gun.

1010
01:45:14,165 --> 01:45:16,751
Hold this point.
Don't let them in!

1011
01:45:31,265 --> 01:45:33,684
Get out of
the mosque!

1012
01:45:51,202 --> 01:45:53,996
Leave the buildings,
for God's sake!

1013
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:55,873
Come out!

1014
01:46:20,689 --> 01:46:22,274
Turn right!

1015
01:46:24,485 --> 01:46:26,112
What's that?

1016
01:47:06,902 --> 01:47:09,363
- Erhan?
- Boss!

1017
01:47:15,619 --> 01:47:17,705
They're killing everyone.

1018
01:47:22,585 --> 01:47:24,378
He's still alive!

1019
01:47:25,171 --> 01:47:26,839
Stop!

1020
01:47:27,882 --> 01:47:30,926
- Erhan, go and support them.
- OK, boss.

1021
01:47:42,688 --> 01:47:44,398
Here you are...

1022
01:48:01,165 --> 01:48:03,959
- Are you OK?
- l'm OK. Nothing's wrong...

1023
01:48:06,796 --> 01:48:08,422
That's all because
of these Kurds!

1024
01:48:08,506 --> 01:48:09,298
What Kurds?

1025
01:48:09,423 --> 01:48:11,967
- Simply Kurds!
- l am Kurdish too!

1026
01:48:12,426 --> 01:48:14,178
You're different Abdulhey.

1027
01:48:14,762 --> 01:48:16,722
lt all starts
like this!

1028
01:48:22,812 --> 01:48:25,439
Patience, Dante.
Patience...

1029
01:48:26,023 --> 01:48:28,109
This Turk is getting
on my nerves...

1030
01:48:34,698 --> 01:48:37,201
Patience means
waiting your turn.

1031
01:48:39,036 --> 01:48:41,122
They're surrounding
us, l think!

1032
01:48:41,414 --> 01:48:43,082
l'm taking the back!

1033
01:48:43,207 --> 01:48:44,375
Abdulhey!

1034
01:48:58,264 --> 01:48:59,932
Abdulhey!

1035
01:49:01,767 --> 01:49:03,310
My God!

1036
01:49:06,647 --> 01:49:08,232
Die like a dog!

1037
01:50:02,495 --> 01:50:03,662
Leyla!

1038
01:52:05,993 --> 01:52:07,912
Allahu Aqbar!

1039
01:52:16,837 --> 01:52:17,922
Leyla?

1040
01:52:33,646 --> 01:52:35,356
Does it hurt, Erhan?

1041
01:52:35,940 --> 01:52:38,734
Yes it does,
but not my wound!

1042
01:52:40,486 --> 01:52:42,655
We have to
find the boss!

1043
01:53:36,459 --> 01:53:38,878
You'll never win!

1044
01:54:41,690 --> 01:54:47,238
Have you killed him?

1045
01:55:04,922 --> 01:55:10,302
lt was nice...

1046
01:55:11,929 --> 01:55:14,974
... to know you.
