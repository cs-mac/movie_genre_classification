1
00:00:24,073 --> 00:00:26,174
<i>We're talking about swinging,</i>

2
00:00:26,175 --> 00:00:27,976
<i>two couples who swing.</i>
<i>Larry Levenson is here.</i>

3
00:00:27,977 --> 00:00:30,111
<i>He's owner of Plato's Retreat</i>
<i>in New York City,</i>

4
00:00:30,112 --> 00:00:32,814
<i>an actual</i>
<i>commercial establishment</i>
<i>where people can go and swing.</i>

5
00:00:32,815 --> 00:00:35,166
Some of the tenets
of swingers

6
00:00:35,167 --> 00:00:37,569
include the separation of--
what they say

7
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,007
is the separation of sex and love.

8
00:00:40,339 --> 00:00:43,358
We promote social intercourse
<i>and</i> sexual intercourse.

9
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:45,410
Whatever you want to do,
you can do.

10
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:49,263
- Aren't you illegal?
- No. No way.

11
00:00:49,264 --> 00:00:51,366
Sex is not illegal
anyplace in New York.

12
00:00:51,367 --> 00:00:53,502
<i>But I couldn't</i>
<i>open a cathouse,</i>
<i>could I?</i>

13
00:00:53,503 --> 00:00:56,103
Well, that's paid sex.

14
00:01:04,413 --> 00:01:07,098
<i>The '70s were</i>
<i>a transitional period.</i>

15
00:01:07,099 --> 00:01:09,901
It was when the ethic
of the '60s took hold.

16
00:01:09,902 --> 00:01:13,438
<i>1500 cops are injured.</i>

17
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,574
<i>People were complaining New</i>
<i>York had become a pit of vice.</i>

18
00:01:16,575 --> 00:01:18,610
<i>That contributed to disco</i>

19
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:21,646
and Plato's also
played its part

20
00:01:21,647 --> 00:01:23,915
<i>in suddenly turning things</i>
<i>around in New York</i>

21
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:25,616
<i>and making New York</i>
<i>what it was--</i>

22
00:01:25,617 --> 00:01:27,268
the most exciting city
in the world.

23
00:01:29,304 --> 00:01:31,155
- <i># you make me feel... #</i>
- it was a party town.

24
00:01:31,156 --> 00:01:33,107
1977 in New York was
a fabulous year.

25
00:01:33,108 --> 00:01:34,976
Sexuality was in the air.

26
00:01:34,977 --> 00:01:37,228
<i>Everybody was</i>
<i>immensely curious.</i>

27
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:39,030
<i>Lots and lots of heteros </i>
<i>would go to the gay clubs</i>

28
00:01:39,031 --> 00:01:40,698
<i>just to look</i>
<i>at the glory holes.</i>

29
00:01:40,699 --> 00:01:43,801
And lots of people who were not
remotely exhibitionistic
would go to Plato's.

30
00:01:43,802 --> 00:01:46,204
Swing couples
went there to swap.

31
00:01:46,205 --> 00:01:47,973
You try my wife
and I'll try your wife.

32
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:51,643
Forget about the sex.
You could wander around.
You could actually swim.

33
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:55,113
<i>You could eat this free</i>
<i>third-rate buffet...</i>

34
00:01:55,114 --> 00:01:59,017
which I always considered
tempting, but dangerous.

35
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:03,788
They had dancing.
They had a show.

36
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:06,774
<i>I thought to myself,</i>
<i>"this really can't be real.</i>

37
00:02:06,775 --> 00:02:08,726
<i>Maybe I'm watching</i>
<i>a dirty movie."</i>

38
00:02:08,727 --> 00:02:11,630
But it was a dirty movie
that really came to life.

39
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:15,616
Friends of mine said that they
went there by looking at it
on cable television.

40
00:02:15,617 --> 00:02:18,086
I was never
in Plato's Retreat.

41
00:02:18,087 --> 00:02:21,790
I have no idea if they
in fact took off--

42
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:24,559
other than clothing.

43
00:02:26,345 --> 00:02:29,347
10 years earlier everyone
was rolling around naked

44
00:02:29,348 --> 00:02:32,083
in Woodstock, you know,

45
00:02:32,084 --> 00:02:36,287
and smoking pot and screwing
their brains out, you know,

46
00:02:36,288 --> 00:02:37,955
in the meadows.

47
00:02:37,956 --> 00:02:41,426
So this was just
an indoor version that was
accessible to New Yorkers.

48
00:02:43,262 --> 00:02:46,597
I am Larry's sister.
We were five years apart.

49
00:02:46,598 --> 00:02:48,550
<i>We were very very close</i>

50
00:02:48,551 --> 00:02:51,786
<i>and we grew up</i>
<i>as best friends.</i>

51
00:02:51,787 --> 00:02:54,956
My parents had
a very conventional
lifestyle and marriage.

52
00:02:54,957 --> 00:02:57,209
<i>My father was</i>
<i>a hard-working man.</i>

53
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,127
<i>He was in</i>
<i>the kosher meat business.</i>

54
00:02:59,128 --> 00:03:02,514
Oldest memories
of Larry are as a...

55
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,398
<i>smiling young man,</i>

56
00:03:04,399 --> 00:03:07,918
didn't really love
the academic pursuits.

57
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:10,921
When I first met Larry,
he had just gotten out
of the service.

58
00:03:10,922 --> 00:03:14,458
<i>He had told me that his father</i>
<i>had a butcher shop</i>

59
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,328
<i>and he was a wholesale</i>
<i>distributer of briskets.</i>

60
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:19,180
And he would work nights.

61
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:21,849
And I really feel
that some of the times
that he said

62
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,185
he was working,
he wasn't working.

63
00:03:24,186 --> 00:03:28,573
When he first married Gloria,
I don't think any of us thought
that it wouldn't last

64
00:03:28,574 --> 00:03:31,976
<i>because we didn't know anybody</i>
<i>who had separated or divorced.</i>

65
00:03:31,977 --> 00:03:34,195
I thought he was
cheating on me.

66
00:03:34,196 --> 00:03:37,916
<i>My dad and my mom got</i>
<i>divorced when I was six.</i>

67
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:40,285
So my dad really
wasn't around a lot.

68
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:42,920
My parents separated
when I was very young.

69
00:03:42,921 --> 00:03:46,358
So my first recollection
actually is when my dad used
to work at McDonald's

70
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:49,143
<i>and he brought me</i>
<i>the hamburglar-- it was</i>
<i>a little stuffed hamburglar.</i>

71
00:03:49,144 --> 00:03:52,363
So that's what I used
to sleep with-- I used to sleep
with a little hamburglar.

72
00:03:52,364 --> 00:03:54,649
All I can remember is
through those years,

73
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:57,385
my mother yelling
at my father on the phone,
"they're waiting for you.

74
00:03:57,386 --> 00:03:59,620
You didn't show up.
You said you were coming."

75
00:03:59,621 --> 00:04:03,141
And of course every business
that Larry was in was
on the weekends.

76
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:06,093
<i>So the times when fathers</i>
<i>would be with their children,</i>

77
00:04:06,094 --> 00:04:08,947
<i>Larry was either off</i>
<i>selling sodas on the beach</i>

78
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:11,182
or preparing
for swingers parties,

79
00:04:11,183 --> 00:04:13,284
wherever
they might be held.

80
00:04:13,285 --> 00:04:15,904
I was very surprised when
Larry was involved

81
00:04:15,905 --> 00:04:17,738
<i>in that kind</i>
<i>of lifestyle.</i>

82
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:21,442
<i>I really didn't think</i>
<i>that it was something that</i>
<i>would be his thing to do.</i>

83
00:04:21,443 --> 00:04:24,379
But maybe I just didn't
know him that well.

84
00:04:29,234 --> 00:04:32,453
<i># what's our favorite</i>
<i>evening game? #</i>

85
00:04:32,454 --> 00:04:34,288
<i># night baseball? #</i>

86
00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:36,758
<i># oh, baby,</i>
<i>you're all wet #</i>

87
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:40,394
<i># let's swap partners</i>
<i>is the name #</i>

88
00:04:40,395 --> 00:04:43,565
<i># suburban roulette... #</i>

89
00:04:43,566 --> 00:04:46,234
You know what I don't like
to see is this thing about
you have to be monogamous.

90
00:04:46,235 --> 00:04:48,636
I say nobody's monogamous.
And if you make somebody say

91
00:04:48,637 --> 00:04:50,805
that you're fucking monogamous
and you're gonna be legitimate,

92
00:04:50,806 --> 00:04:52,740
"I married her.
I'm never gonna fuck,"
I'm a liar.

93
00:04:52,741 --> 00:04:55,160
The swinging movement
was very small

94
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:57,062
and very secret.

95
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:59,531
We all have jobs and we all
pay mortgages.

96
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:03,034
Just because we consider
ourselves swingers,

97
00:05:03,035 --> 00:05:06,738
we're not freaks of nature.

98
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:08,973
<i># I love your sister #</i>

99
00:05:08,974 --> 00:05:10,375
<i># tomorrow night... #</i>

100
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:14,378
At a swing party, you can go,
you can find-- meet other people

101
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:16,464
<i>that maybe can meet some</i>
<i>of your sexual needs</i>

102
00:05:16,465 --> 00:05:18,383
<i>that maybe your spouse can't.</i>

103
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:21,052
And yet you don't have
to go out and cheat.

104
00:05:21,053 --> 00:05:24,638
Swinging is a situation
where a man and a woman,

105
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,175
part of their sex life

106
00:05:27,176 --> 00:05:29,643
is to find other couples
or other people

107
00:05:29,644 --> 00:05:31,578
that have similar interests,

108
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:34,148
that they like socially,
they like to be with,

109
00:05:34,149 --> 00:05:36,684
but in particular
they want to have sex with.

110
00:05:36,685 --> 00:05:39,854
<i># suburban roulette... #</i>

111
00:05:39,855 --> 00:05:44,025
<i># suburban roulette! #</i>

112
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:49,647
The meeting area
was usually a bar

113
00:05:49,648 --> 00:05:54,586
that they took over
for Friday, Saturday night.

114
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:57,821
I worked as a waitress
and some guys used to come in

115
00:05:57,822 --> 00:06:00,591
and they brought in "screw"
magazine and I brought it home

116
00:06:00,592 --> 00:06:03,294
and I showed it
to Charlie.

117
00:06:03,295 --> 00:06:07,131
- And that's all it took.
- And there were all kinds
of ads in it.

118
00:06:07,132 --> 00:06:11,402
- And we started
to think about it.
- Get interested.

119
00:06:11,403 --> 00:06:13,571
It was interesting.

120
00:06:17,226 --> 00:06:19,644
It was a place for them
to dance,

121
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:21,312
have a drink,
meet each other.

122
00:06:21,313 --> 00:06:23,248
I remember it looked more
like a Bar Mitzvah.

123
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:27,085
<i># hey, little girl,</i>
<i>get your dancing shoes #</i>

124
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:28,653
<i># gold satin jacket... #</i>

125
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:32,122
I don't know anybody's last name
in any of these places.

126
00:06:32,123 --> 00:06:34,859
And yet you can go home
with them, make love to them,

127
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,745
spend the weekend with them,
kiss them goodbye--

128
00:06:37,746 --> 00:06:40,181
"see you next week,
John, Mary. Bye-bye."

129
00:06:40,182 --> 00:06:43,351
And that's the end of it
and you're best friends
for life.

130
00:06:43,352 --> 00:06:45,670
<i>People would be handing out</i>
<i>slips that say,</i>

131
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:48,088
<i>"okay, there's a party</i>
<i>on the east side tonight."</i>

132
00:06:48,089 --> 00:06:50,508
The only problem is
when you're stoned,

133
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:54,145
and I said, "Now I gotta
go to Queens?"

134
00:06:54,146 --> 00:06:57,198
<i># the roller coaster</i>
<i>gotta make the most #</i>

135
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,533
<i># and dance dance dance... #</i>

136
00:06:58,534 --> 00:07:02,403
I met Larry Levenson at a party
back in the mid-'70s

137
00:07:02,404 --> 00:07:04,272
<i>in Coney Island, Brooklyn.</i>

138
00:07:04,273 --> 00:07:07,941
And he started arranging some
organized swing parties.

139
00:07:07,942 --> 00:07:10,211
He liked the idea

140
00:07:10,212 --> 00:07:13,297
of being able to have
that scene out in the open

141
00:07:13,298 --> 00:07:15,132
the way gay bars did.

142
00:07:15,133 --> 00:07:17,735
It was a one-man band
at the beginning.

143
00:07:17,736 --> 00:07:21,305
It was just him and Mary
and maybe a couple
of other people.

144
00:07:24,175 --> 00:07:26,443
<i>Mary made</i>
<i>all the phone calls.</i>

145
00:07:26,444 --> 00:07:28,897
<i>Mary did a lot</i>
<i>of the footwork.</i>

146
00:07:28,898 --> 00:07:31,616
Mary was actually responsible
for putting together

147
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,751
<i>the logo of Plato's.</i>

148
00:07:33,752 --> 00:07:36,854
The backward twos
was Mary's idea.

149
00:07:36,855 --> 00:07:40,224
I'm going to ask you
one of my favorite
indiscreet questions.

150
00:07:40,225 --> 00:07:43,911
How did you and Larry meet?
Now come on, the truth now.

151
00:07:43,912 --> 00:07:48,416
Well, I had come
with another young man
to Plato's

152
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:50,351
in its first location.

153
00:07:50,352 --> 00:07:53,755
And I fell in love
with him on the spot.

154
00:07:53,756 --> 00:07:56,240
<i># when I get home, babe... #</i>

155
00:07:56,241 --> 00:07:59,226
<i>Mary and Larry were swingers</i>

156
00:07:59,227 --> 00:08:01,495
<i>And they started</i>
<i>the club together.</i>

157
00:08:01,496 --> 00:08:04,115
<i>And it seemed like</i>
<i>a perfect idea</i>

158
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:06,768
and a way to be close.

159
00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:08,970
So it was a family thing.

160
00:08:08,971 --> 00:08:11,555
<i># I wanna kiss you</i>
<i>all over... #</i>

161
00:08:11,556 --> 00:08:14,826
<i>What did he say?</i>
<i>Do you remember?</i>

162
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,644
Out with it!

163
00:08:16,645 --> 00:08:19,781
I was on my way
to the ladies' room

164
00:08:19,782 --> 00:08:23,184
and he told me to come
on in the water.

165
00:08:23,185 --> 00:08:25,252
And I told him
I couldn't right then

166
00:08:25,253 --> 00:08:27,622
because I was on my way
to the ladies' room.

167
00:08:27,623 --> 00:08:30,391
And he said, "come on in.
The water's nice and warm

168
00:08:30,392 --> 00:08:32,193
and that's how
it got that way."

169
00:08:32,194 --> 00:08:35,262
That's it, that's Larry--
Mr. Taste.

170
00:08:35,263 --> 00:08:37,631
- You got to know Mary
better than me...
- Yes.

171
00:08:37,632 --> 00:08:41,302
...Physically and mentally.

172
00:08:41,303 --> 00:08:45,189
That might have been
your first female, I think.
Really, huh?

173
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,874
- No.
- No?

174
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:49,010
It mushroomed from there.

175
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:50,878
<i>Got ahold of a hotel--</i>

176
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:54,315
this hotel basement
pool area.

177
00:08:54,316 --> 00:08:56,267
Yeah, so this call came in
from somebody--

178
00:08:56,268 --> 00:08:58,085
I don't remember
who it is anymore,

179
00:08:58,086 --> 00:09:01,756
some friend or acquaintance
and said, "there's this
live sex club

180
00:09:01,757 --> 00:09:04,224
where people are having sex
in front of everybody."

181
00:09:04,225 --> 00:09:06,844
And I said, "you mean
a gay bar?"

182
00:09:06,845 --> 00:09:09,580
and they said, "no no,
these are straight people."

183
00:09:09,581 --> 00:09:12,900
<i># am I dreaming #</i>

184
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:14,886
<i># that you're with me? #</i>

185
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,255
- <i># am I dreaming... #</i>
- <i>Plato's was always</i>

186
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:19,390
<i>for couples only.</i>

187
00:09:19,391 --> 00:09:23,060
And of course we always
invited single ladies.

188
00:09:23,061 --> 00:09:25,095
It was a tacky little place.

189
00:09:25,096 --> 00:09:27,648
And sitting behind there
is this guy Larry--

190
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:30,518
<i>who I later learned</i>
<i>is Larry Levenson.</i>
<i>He seemed in charge</i>

191
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:33,137
and he's sitting there
in a towel,

192
00:09:33,138 --> 00:09:34,439
and that's it.

193
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,941
One of the best
parts of it for me

194
00:09:36,942 --> 00:09:39,110
was that it was relaxed
in the sense that people

195
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:41,179
were coming and not necessarily
doing anything.

196
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,281
Not even necessarily taking
their clothes off.

197
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:44,932
Two of the men...

198
00:09:44,933 --> 00:09:47,134
were wearing no clothes

199
00:09:47,135 --> 00:09:49,903
<i>except for black socks</i>
<i>and shoes.</i>

200
00:09:49,904 --> 00:09:54,409
And walking around that way,
kinda like that stag-film look.

201
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,327
<i>So I wrote it up.</i>

202
00:09:56,328 --> 00:09:58,562
I played it pretty big.

203
00:09:58,563 --> 00:10:02,000
And a few days later
I went there-- went back.

204
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:05,820
<i># one thing I feel</i>
<i>that I like... #</i>

205
00:10:05,821 --> 00:10:09,040
Plato's was a simple name.
It's the only one I could
spell actually.

206
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,275
So we used Plato's.
Then after that I found out

207
00:10:11,276 --> 00:10:13,511
that Plato's was gay,
but it was too late.

208
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:16,197
The lines were
just unbelievable.

209
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:20,267
I mean we went from, what?
30, 40 couples or people

210
00:10:20,268 --> 00:10:21,802
to 400!

211
00:10:21,803 --> 00:10:24,771
Now you have a lot of people
that don't know the old crowd.

212
00:10:24,772 --> 00:10:27,007
<i>There were people that used</i>
<i>to come to Plato's</i>

213
00:10:27,008 --> 00:10:30,711
<i>that to most people--</i>
<i>would say were not the most</i>
<i>physically appealing,</i>

214
00:10:30,712 --> 00:10:33,865
<i>but they were the nicest people</i>
<i>you'd ever want to meet</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

215
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:37,452
They were walking around
with the black socks
and the shoes,

216
00:10:37,453 --> 00:10:40,204
<i>and this new group</i>
<i>were just naked</i>

217
00:10:40,205 --> 00:10:42,556
<i>and much wilder.</i>

218
00:10:42,557 --> 00:10:46,426
People say, "hey, you got
a date? You want a night out?"
et cetera, et cetera.

219
00:10:46,427 --> 00:10:50,164
"You and your date,
you got a date that's
sort of on the wild side?"

220
00:10:52,968 --> 00:10:55,469
Personally I think that

221
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,738
with a little
encouragement

222
00:10:57,739 --> 00:11:00,707
everybody's
on the wild side.

223
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:03,678
All of a sudden he really
was on a runaway tiger--

224
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:05,279
of sex.

225
00:11:10,568 --> 00:11:14,355
- It was like a big party.
- There was literally lines
around the block.

226
00:11:14,356 --> 00:11:17,625
<i>They were just coming down</i>
<i>and in and taking over</i>

227
00:11:17,626 --> 00:11:20,394
and dancing and holding hands,

228
00:11:20,395 --> 00:11:22,296
and hugging.
It was a sight.

229
00:11:24,967 --> 00:11:26,583
Freaked me out.
I didn't know.

230
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:31,789
<i>Plato's was becoming big.</i>
<i>We needed a big place.</i>

231
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,757
We needed a special place.

232
00:11:33,758 --> 00:11:36,427
He contacted a couple
of good friends of his

233
00:11:36,428 --> 00:11:39,246
which I also knew:
Frank Pernice,

234
00:11:39,247 --> 00:11:41,732
Frankie-- he was
some sort of caterer.

235
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:44,701
Frank came home
one day and said,

236
00:11:44,702 --> 00:11:48,255
"what a great idea.
This has to be fantastic."

237
00:11:48,256 --> 00:11:50,558
About a week
or two weeks later,

238
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:52,760
we met Hy Gordon there.

239
00:11:52,761 --> 00:11:55,629
Could be dangerous.

240
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:58,432
They were gentlemen.
They were the type of people
that they didn't have

241
00:11:58,433 --> 00:12:01,535
to throw their weight around,
if you understand what I mean.

242
00:12:01,536 --> 00:12:03,804
Why Larry had to hook up
with these people--

243
00:12:03,805 --> 00:12:06,790
I can't tell.
I don't know.

244
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,910
Frankie used to say
that Larry had a grocery store

245
00:12:09,911 --> 00:12:11,763
and he turned it
into a supermarket.

246
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:15,066
<i>He ended up renting</i>
<i>the Ansonia Hotel.</i>

247
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,069
<i>It was actually a gay...</i>

248
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,054
- bathhouse.
- ...bathhouse.

249
00:12:20,055 --> 00:12:22,823
<i>In fact Bette Midler</i>
<i>sang there.</i>

250
00:12:22,824 --> 00:12:24,558
And what's-his-name.

251
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:27,945
- The piano player--
Barry Manilow.
- Barry Manilow.

252
00:12:27,946 --> 00:12:32,033
<i># Tootsie roll soul</i>
<i>and doodle-white shoes... #</i>

253
00:12:32,034 --> 00:12:34,485
<i>When I first heard</i>
<i>about Plato's,</i>

254
00:12:34,486 --> 00:12:38,339
<i>all my ideas and everything</i>
<i>I had heard about Plato's</i>
<i>basically was wrong.</i>

255
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,841
<i>I thought that I would walk</i>
<i>through the door and trip over</i>

256
00:12:40,842 --> 00:12:43,144
<i>a lot of fucking bodies</i>
<i>in the middle of the floor.</i>

257
00:12:43,145 --> 00:12:45,446
And it just doesn't
happen that way.

258
00:12:45,447 --> 00:12:48,499
It was a dark door,
just a rope outside.

259
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,235
It had a long stairway
going down.

260
00:12:51,236 --> 00:12:53,271
<i>And I think</i>
<i>the admissions people</i>

261
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,639
were at the top
of the stairway.

262
00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:00,561
Walking into Plato's is not
necessarily an event in itself.

263
00:13:00,562 --> 00:13:03,481
Just being there
is the event.

264
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:06,800
Plato's Retreat is not
a sex club, it's a swing club

265
00:13:06,801 --> 00:13:09,102
for free-thinking free-living
adult couples.

266
00:13:09,103 --> 00:13:12,890
It's a club
with everything disco,
everything included,

267
00:13:12,891 --> 00:13:14,808
<i>with sex available</i>
<i>if couples want it.</i>

268
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,696
<i>I asked,</i>
<i>"what the fuck is it?"</i>

269
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:21,899
You know?
There's like 20 mattresses
laid together.

270
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:25,169
It was a dance floor.
Then you had the dance floor
in front of me.

271
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:28,506
Most everyone was
walking around naked.

272
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:32,676
As I said, at first we wrapped
our towels around us

273
00:13:32,677 --> 00:13:35,112
when we first walked out,
but then when we saw

274
00:13:35,113 --> 00:13:37,698
the atmosphere
of everybody very free,

275
00:13:37,699 --> 00:13:40,050
<i>laughing, kissing,</i>

276
00:13:40,051 --> 00:13:44,222
and really without their towels,
we figured what the heck.

277
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:46,524
<i>I don't know, it was</i>
<i>just kind of like</i>

278
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:49,143
<i>a bathhouse locker room.</i>
<i>But I do think that there was</i>

279
00:13:49,144 --> 00:13:51,996
A lot of, like,
coaching going on,

280
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,815
at least with the women
and encouragement,

281
00:13:54,816 --> 00:13:57,902
and a feeling of sisterhood
like we're all in this together.

282
00:13:57,903 --> 00:14:00,204
There was just lots
of lonely people

283
00:14:00,205 --> 00:14:02,673
<i>looking to meet other people.</i>

284
00:14:02,674 --> 00:14:05,743
Sex was part of the game,
but it wasn't the whole game.

285
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:07,978
Nobody made fun of you.

286
00:14:07,979 --> 00:14:09,964
Nobody said, "ugh!"
you know?

287
00:14:09,965 --> 00:14:13,618
<i>How you look,</i>
<i>how you look disgusting</i>
<i>or whatever--</i>

288
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:16,069
Any inhibitions you had
you got over.

289
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,707
And you didn't
have them anymore.

290
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:22,926
<i># I can see you coming</i>
<i>a mile away... #</i>

291
00:14:22,927 --> 00:14:24,845
And you had a jacuzzi.

292
00:14:24,846 --> 00:14:27,264
<i>Anyone who went into</i>
<i>the jacuzzi was insane</i>

293
00:14:27,265 --> 00:14:30,568
Because I think there was
every kind of bacteria.
It was chemical warfare.

294
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:33,237
We played ping-pong.
We went swimming.

295
00:14:33,238 --> 00:14:37,007
<i>People have a sense of</i>
<i>being cleansed in a pool.</i>

296
00:14:37,008 --> 00:14:39,009
This was a naughty pool.

297
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:42,179
<i>Guys were floating on the top</i>
<i>of the water</i>

298
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:45,582
And their penises were sticking
up and it looked like
periscopes.

299
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,706
I had just come from Paris
so I was a young photographer,

300
00:14:52,707 --> 00:14:55,476
<i>and kind of a shy girl</i>
<i>from Ohio.</i>

301
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,428
<i>So I-- I--</i>

302
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:58,846
I disrobed...

303
00:15:00,248 --> 00:15:02,115
<i>And I plunge into the pool.</i>

304
00:15:02,116 --> 00:15:03,684
And I'm swimming.
I, like, go.

305
00:15:03,685 --> 00:15:06,820
I sort of underwatered
the whole length of the pool.

306
00:15:06,821 --> 00:15:11,325
And when I come up,
I see all these men
standing around the pool

307
00:15:11,326 --> 00:15:13,527
<i>And they're all jerking off.</i>

308
00:15:13,528 --> 00:15:16,463
And their come is, like,
coming in an arc

309
00:15:16,464 --> 00:15:18,932
across the pool
over my head.

310
00:15:18,933 --> 00:15:21,067
It was just amazing.

311
00:15:21,068 --> 00:15:23,103
That was one of
my biggest regrets--

312
00:15:23,104 --> 00:15:24,838
was that I didn't
get that picture.

313
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,374
- You go there, right?
- Definitely, yes.

314
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,543
- There's a membership fee?
How much is it?
- Right.

315
00:15:29,544 --> 00:15:31,111
It cost $25 per couple.

316
00:15:31,112 --> 00:15:34,281
<i>Now for that, you get</i>
<i>a meal that was fantastic,</i>

317
00:15:34,282 --> 00:15:36,968
like you get
at any Bar Mitzvah,
a full smorgasbord.

318
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:40,470
Chicken, ribs, chow mein,

319
00:15:40,471 --> 00:15:43,674
lasagna, meatballs.

320
00:15:43,675 --> 00:15:46,494
- Spaghetti.
- No, lasagna.

321
00:15:46,495 --> 00:15:48,813
- Oh, okay.
- Potato salad, macaroni.

322
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:51,314
- Cold cuts.
- Coleslaw.

323
00:15:51,315 --> 00:15:53,050
- Cold cuts.
- Cold cuts.

324
00:15:53,051 --> 00:15:55,519
- Did I say chicken?
- Yeah.

325
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,373
Why are you asking about
that horrible food?

326
00:15:59,374 --> 00:16:04,244
Jesus.
Which, by the way,
Larry thought was wonderful.

327
00:16:04,245 --> 00:16:07,081
Larry really thought
that was wonderful.

328
00:16:07,082 --> 00:16:10,016
He was so proud
of his buffet.

329
00:16:10,017 --> 00:16:11,918
But the buffet
was disgusting.

330
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:14,921
There was people--
oral sex this and that--

331
00:16:14,922 --> 00:16:18,058
All crazy sex things.
So we left there.

332
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:20,761
I said I want to go
to the room and eat
my sandwich.

333
00:16:20,762 --> 00:16:23,597
So we went to another room--
I guess the pool table--

334
00:16:23,598 --> 00:16:25,799
and they were having sex
on the pool table.

335
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,801
We used to go buy
pizza for ourselves

336
00:16:27,802 --> 00:16:30,136
and it was real good pizza
and we said to Larry,

337
00:16:30,137 --> 00:16:32,873
- "it would be nice after
the food's almost gone"--
- <i>just to break it up.</i>

338
00:16:32,874 --> 00:16:36,209
- About 1:00 in the morning.
- When you start running
out of food

339
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:38,445
and people come out of the orgy
or they're dancing,

340
00:16:38,446 --> 00:16:41,348
swimming-- you feel
like grabbing something.

341
00:16:41,349 --> 00:16:43,951
They're tired of
a bologna sandwich.

342
00:16:43,952 --> 00:16:46,553
I said, "Hey, why don't you
order 10 pies?"

343
00:16:47,689 --> 00:16:49,589
"Why not?"

344
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,859
- You weren't
hiding, were you?
- No.

345
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,161
- Did you meet a nice girl?
- No.

346
00:16:55,997 --> 00:16:58,782
<i>Everything was open except</i>
<i>these few black cubicles.</i>

347
00:16:58,783 --> 00:17:01,485
That you could have private sex
if you felt embarrassed

348
00:17:01,486 --> 00:17:03,921
to be doing it in front
of the Japanese tourists.

349
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:06,590
<i>You could hear conversations in</i>
<i>the room to the right of you,</i>

350
00:17:06,591 --> 00:17:09,043
on the left of you.
You'd hear women trying
to figure out

351
00:17:09,044 --> 00:17:11,645
who was going to carpool
to Hebrew School in the morning.

352
00:17:11,646 --> 00:17:13,831
We spent some
very very happy hours

353
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:17,535
controlling our hysteria

354
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,504
so that people inside wouldn't
know that we were listening

355
00:17:20,505 --> 00:17:24,274
to the kind of forced dialogue
between people who have just met

356
00:17:24,275 --> 00:17:26,510
in an orgy room.

357
00:17:26,511 --> 00:17:30,414
It was good stuff.
I wish I'd recorded some of it.

358
00:17:30,415 --> 00:17:33,033
When Larry showed me
into this closed Cubicle

359
00:17:33,034 --> 00:17:35,769
and the woman
in there was his wife Mary,

360
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:39,673
<i>he seemed almost excited</i>
<i>to be able to introduce Mary</i>
<i>to the press:</i>

361
00:17:39,674 --> 00:17:42,409
"Hi, Mary, how are you?
This is John Leo."

362
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:46,647
And again it was
almost the enthusiasm

363
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:49,884
of a Kiwanis executive
showing off his home town.

364
00:17:49,885 --> 00:17:52,302
-<i> Why repress your desires?</i>
- <i>What?</i>

365
00:17:52,303 --> 00:17:55,556
- Why repress your desires?
- I'd like to be in the
Indianapolis 500 too,

366
00:17:55,557 --> 00:17:58,959
but I have the common sense
not to engage in it because
it's not good for me.

367
00:18:03,681 --> 00:18:07,501
And that's just what he said--
"it's not good for everybody."

368
00:18:07,502 --> 00:18:09,469
So for you,
it wouldn't be good.

369
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:12,172
The mattress room was
the most intense.

370
00:18:12,173 --> 00:18:15,575
And for people who found Plato's
really uncomfortable

371
00:18:15,576 --> 00:18:18,445
in terms of almost morally,

372
00:18:18,446 --> 00:18:20,748
that was the toughest place
to go and look.

373
00:18:20,749 --> 00:18:23,467
You would have maybe
200 bodies in there

374
00:18:23,468 --> 00:18:25,335
<i>on a busy night</i>

375
00:18:25,336 --> 00:18:29,173
and just writhing together
like a bucket of worms.

376
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:32,510
<i># love today,</i>
<i>cry tomorrow #</i>

377
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:35,679
<i># who's to say #</i>

378
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,565
<i># life is gay... #</i>
- <i>"look at that guy's--</i>

379
00:18:38,566 --> 00:18:42,152
he's not really handsome,
but look what he's got.

380
00:18:42,153 --> 00:18:44,688
And look what she's got
and where is that going?"

381
00:18:44,689 --> 00:18:47,324
It was real and your ears
could hear it was real.

382
00:18:47,325 --> 00:18:49,259
Someone--

383
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,496
the breathing and even
the smell and the sweat

384
00:18:52,497 --> 00:18:53,831
and the-- ugh.

385
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:56,966
It exhilarated me
and at the same time

386
00:18:56,967 --> 00:18:58,968
it sort of depressed me.

387
00:18:58,969 --> 00:19:02,906
Because it completely
kills your notions

388
00:19:02,907 --> 00:19:05,275
about romance.

389
00:19:05,276 --> 00:19:08,696
Like a dance floor,
sometimes people are
just dancing.

390
00:19:08,697 --> 00:19:13,383
<i>But sometimes there's</i>
<i>a groove-- a tribal groove</i>

391
00:19:13,384 --> 00:19:14,884
that people get in

392
00:19:14,885 --> 00:19:17,554
and be in incredible synch
and there would be

393
00:19:17,555 --> 00:19:20,223
a lot of energy
and it was like that
with the mattress room.

394
00:19:20,224 --> 00:19:23,059
I was terrified
of the matt room.

395
00:19:27,782 --> 00:19:30,968
And you'd fuck a little
and you watch a little
and hang out,

396
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:32,453
fuck a little more.

397
00:19:32,454 --> 00:19:37,341
<i># danger in the shape</i>
<i>of something wild #</i>

398
00:19:41,112 --> 00:19:45,782
<i># stranger dressed in black,</i>
<i>she's a hungry child... #</i>

399
00:20:04,435 --> 00:20:08,072
<i>Bacho the disc jockey, he told</i>
<i>me, "you're a reporter, right?"</i>

400
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:10,407
He says, "watch!"
he played the music.

401
00:20:10,408 --> 00:20:14,110
He'd speed up the music
and the things would go faster.

402
00:20:14,111 --> 00:20:17,080
He slowed down
the music and the things
would go slower.

403
00:20:17,081 --> 00:20:19,650
It was unbelievable.
You had to be there to see that.

404
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:25,472
Fast and slow lovemaking.

405
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:37,501
<i>Ejaculation juices</i>
<i>were everywhere.</i>

406
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:39,753
<i>So I'm sitting on a lot</i>
<i>of these wet cushions.</i>

407
00:20:39,754 --> 00:20:41,721
<i>And then on one</i>
<i>of these nights I go home</i>

408
00:20:41,722 --> 00:20:44,308
and I start feeling
really itchy.

409
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:47,043
"Oooh, what's that?
What is that?"

410
00:20:47,044 --> 00:20:51,548
And then I looked down and I see
all these crabs were in there

411
00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:54,318
and I just got
a big dose of it.

412
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:57,254
You know, because that's
where crabs breed

413
00:20:57,255 --> 00:21:01,791
is in all those damp,
moist...

414
00:21:01,792 --> 00:21:04,528
nether places.

415
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:06,596
I mean, I just remember
a lot of this--

416
00:21:06,597 --> 00:21:09,233
you know,
in the mattress room.

417
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:12,753
<i># hot child in the city. #</i>

418
00:21:12,754 --> 00:21:15,721
What made you organize--

419
00:21:15,722 --> 00:21:18,258
originate
Plato's Retreat,

420
00:21:18,259 --> 00:21:20,460
A place
for swinging couples?

421
00:21:20,461 --> 00:21:23,395
- <i>What is</i>
<i>the swinging movement?</i>
- It's a couples' movement.

422
00:21:23,396 --> 00:21:25,764
<i>Couples that want</i>
<i>to be free-thinking,</i>

423
00:21:25,765 --> 00:21:28,000
free-living adult couples.

424
00:21:28,001 --> 00:21:30,103
They don't believe
in monogamous relationships.

425
00:21:30,104 --> 00:21:33,405
They would rather
get involved with other people

426
00:21:33,406 --> 00:21:36,642
but together with their spouses
instead of cheating with them.

427
00:21:38,212 --> 00:21:42,565
<i># I was born</i>
<i>with a smile on my face #</i>

428
00:21:42,566 --> 00:21:45,368
<i># the whole of my life's</i>
<i>been a pantomime... #</i>

429
00:21:45,369 --> 00:21:48,071
<i>Larry had the pitch</i>
<i>and tone of a missionary.</i>

430
00:21:48,072 --> 00:21:51,774
<i>He thought he was the future</i>
<i>and he was pulling back</i>
<i>the curtain</i>

431
00:21:51,775 --> 00:21:54,677
<i>on something</i>
<i>wholesome and happy.</i>

432
00:21:54,678 --> 00:21:56,980
I only actually
met him once,

433
00:21:56,981 --> 00:21:59,882
and I was unable
to shake his hand

434
00:21:59,883 --> 00:22:03,186
because just before
he extended it,

435
00:22:03,187 --> 00:22:05,154
he was doing something
with it

436
00:22:05,155 --> 00:22:09,058
that would tend to make you
want to stay several yards away.

437
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:12,628
<i># born with a smile</i>
<i>on my face... #</i>

438
00:22:12,629 --> 00:22:16,014
<i>Larry said, "I fall in love</i>
<i>with every woman</i>

439
00:22:16,015 --> 00:22:18,884
<i>I have sex with,</i>
<i>even if I have sex</i>
<i>with 10 women a night."</i>

440
00:22:18,885 --> 00:22:21,437
<i>And Larry</i> could <i>have sex</i>
<i>with 10 women a night.</i>

441
00:22:21,438 --> 00:22:23,572
<i>He was phenomenal that way.</i>

442
00:22:23,573 --> 00:22:25,741
He said, "It's always
romance,

443
00:22:25,742 --> 00:22:28,877
it's always exciting
and I'm always grateful."

444
00:22:28,878 --> 00:22:32,131
<i># to have your leisure</i>
<i>give you pleasure... #</i>

445
00:22:32,132 --> 00:22:34,083
The thing I mostly remember
is he had these giant teeth.

446
00:22:34,084 --> 00:22:36,085
He had really huge teeth.

447
00:22:36,086 --> 00:22:38,971
There's a yiddish word--
<i>hamisch--</i> and that's
what he was.

448
00:22:38,972 --> 00:22:41,640
He was like
your nicest uncle.

449
00:22:41,641 --> 00:22:43,359
- A Hugh Hefner.
- A maitre d'.

450
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,477
Larry was...

451
00:22:45,478 --> 00:22:47,947
no question a trailblazer.
He was a pioneer

452
00:22:47,948 --> 00:22:50,033
in his field.
Quite the guy.

453
00:22:50,034 --> 00:22:52,485
Whether you
were in the business,
whether you were rich,

454
00:22:52,486 --> 00:22:54,787
whatever, Larry always
had time for you...

455
00:22:54,788 --> 00:22:57,223
especially if you had
a great-looking wife.

456
00:22:57,224 --> 00:22:59,942
I think he was lonely.
I think he loved attention.

457
00:22:59,943 --> 00:23:02,611
He loved having people
around him, you know?

458
00:23:02,612 --> 00:23:04,780
And he loved being, I guess,

459
00:23:04,781 --> 00:23:06,516
you know, the guy with--

460
00:23:06,517 --> 00:23:09,385
the kid with the--
with the baseball bat.

461
00:23:09,386 --> 00:23:11,820
It was his glove, his bat,
his ball, you know?

462
00:23:11,821 --> 00:23:13,622
Hi there. It's Larry
and Mary again

463
00:23:13,623 --> 00:23:15,357
to tell you about
Plato's Retreat,

464
00:23:15,358 --> 00:23:18,227
the first and only
couples' club of its kind
anywhere.

465
00:23:18,228 --> 00:23:20,329
Yes, there's a full-length
swimming pool

466
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:23,632
and outrageous whirlpool
which holds about 30 people
at a time,

467
00:23:23,633 --> 00:23:25,667
disco dancing
with a live DJ.

468
00:23:25,668 --> 00:23:28,871
I grew up
in the upper-middleclass
Jewish Catskills

469
00:23:28,872 --> 00:23:30,856
<i>of the Concord Hotel.</i>

470
00:23:30,857 --> 00:23:33,209
<i>I was Miss Concord Hotel</i>
<i>at 16.</i>

471
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:35,043
<i>And it seemed to me that</i>

472
00:23:35,044 --> 00:23:37,930
all of those people
had children,

473
00:23:37,931 --> 00:23:41,234
and all those children
moved to Long Island,

474
00:23:41,235 --> 00:23:44,003
and Southern Jersey.

475
00:23:44,004 --> 00:23:46,572
And all of them
went to Plato's.

476
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:52,778
<i># when I wake up #</i>

477
00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:54,930
<i># in the morning light... #</i>

478
00:23:54,931 --> 00:23:58,517
<i>The crowd at Plato's</i>
<i>was conventional.</i>

479
00:23:58,518 --> 00:24:00,486
<i>It wasn't filled</i>
<i>with my friends,</i>

480
00:24:00,487 --> 00:24:03,289
<i>but it did a great job</i>
<i>in some ways because it sort of</i>

481
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:06,475
<i>liberated Long Island.</i>
<i>It liberated New Jersey.</i>

482
00:24:06,476 --> 00:24:09,111
<i>I never saw a velvet-rope</i>
<i>type situation there.</i>

483
00:24:09,112 --> 00:24:11,514
<i>I don't think there might</i>
<i>have been a velvet rope.</i>

484
00:24:11,515 --> 00:24:13,248
I never saw an eager crowd
waiting to get in

485
00:24:13,249 --> 00:24:14,750
with bouncers
keeping them out.

486
00:24:14,751 --> 00:24:19,705
Everything at Plato's,
even the ugly person--

487
00:24:19,706 --> 00:24:22,308
I don't think there
were any-- was-- was--

488
00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:24,009
had a certain charm.

489
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:26,828
- It was a poor man's
playboy mansion.
- Absolutely.

490
00:24:26,829 --> 00:24:29,231
<i>I actually admire people</i>
<i>that are that free</i>

491
00:24:29,232 --> 00:24:31,867
that could go into a place like
that and just let it
all hang out,

492
00:24:31,868 --> 00:24:34,036
take all their clothes off
and walk around--

493
00:24:34,037 --> 00:24:37,123
including those fat people that
look like they've got, you know,

494
00:24:37,124 --> 00:24:39,158
<i>double sets of twins</i>
<i>in their belly.</i>

495
00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:41,510
<i>I'm amazed that they can</i>
<i>do that because even though</i>

496
00:24:41,511 --> 00:24:45,614
<i>I looked a lot different then--</i>
<i>I was skinnier</i>

497
00:24:45,615 --> 00:24:49,418
and I had two breasts--
I couldn't take my clothes off
in front of strangers.

498
00:24:49,419 --> 00:24:52,955
I mean, I think it takes
a lot of something to be
able to do that.

499
00:24:52,956 --> 00:24:55,407
<i># I'll meet ya</i>
<i>in the usual place...#</i>

500
00:24:55,408 --> 00:24:57,843
<i>I thought they had</i>
<i>resuscitated the orgy</i>

501
00:24:57,844 --> 00:25:00,712
<i>For the man in the street,</i>
<i>which is exactly what they did.</i>

502
00:25:00,713 --> 00:25:02,664
You pay whatever it is--
20, 25 bucks--

503
00:25:02,665 --> 00:25:05,968
You get in and you can
join in an orgy.

504
00:25:05,969 --> 00:25:08,204
Where can you do that
in the United States?

505
00:25:09,373 --> 00:25:11,307
You could do it
at Plato's.

506
00:25:11,308 --> 00:25:13,175
My friends were very...

507
00:25:13,176 --> 00:25:15,545
you know, backwards.

508
00:25:15,546 --> 00:25:19,381
And I-- I grew
away from my friends.

509
00:25:19,382 --> 00:25:23,719
I grew away.
I went to the city.
I went to bars.

510
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,355
I went up on Second Avenue,
First Avenue,

511
00:25:26,356 --> 00:25:30,092
up to Uptown.
I wanted to meet
a more educated crowd.

512
00:25:30,093 --> 00:25:32,294
I was no boy scout.
I was a wild guy,

513
00:25:32,295 --> 00:25:34,580
Very uninhibited.
I was a model.

514
00:25:34,581 --> 00:25:36,915
<i>The first time I heard</i>
<i>about Plato's Retreat</i>

515
00:25:36,916 --> 00:25:40,035
was I went to Club Med
at Martinique with
a friend of mine

516
00:25:40,036 --> 00:25:43,206
and this guy was telling me,
"Miles, you're gonna love
this place.

517
00:25:43,207 --> 00:25:46,075
It's wild.
Everyone's having sex
all over the place."

518
00:25:46,076 --> 00:25:48,528
My boyfriend was a minister.

519
00:25:48,529 --> 00:25:52,331
and he asked me

520
00:25:52,332 --> 00:25:55,167
to go to Plato's Retreat
that night

521
00:25:55,168 --> 00:25:56,802
And we went.

522
00:25:56,803 --> 00:25:59,938
I was a tingling mess
of hormones.

523
00:25:59,939 --> 00:26:02,791
I was like-- almost like
when you're a teenager.

524
00:26:02,792 --> 00:26:05,110
<i>As soon as I walked</i>
<i>down the stairs,</i>

525
00:26:05,111 --> 00:26:07,145
a little redheaded girl
comes up to me,

526
00:26:07,146 --> 00:26:08,980
really pretty,
grabs me by the arm

527
00:26:08,981 --> 00:26:11,050
and says, "Come here.
Come with me."

528
00:26:11,051 --> 00:26:14,970
<i>At first we talked</i>
<i>to each other for a little bit.</i>

529
00:26:14,971 --> 00:26:17,339
And, um, you know,

530
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:20,042
he was obviously more
comfortable there than I was.

531
00:26:20,043 --> 00:26:22,394
We go right into
a little private room.

532
00:26:22,395 --> 00:26:24,279
You'll love that.
We're in Plato's Retreat,

533
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,498
where everyone's having
sex all over the place,

534
00:26:26,499 --> 00:26:29,167
there are little rooms
called "for the inhibited."

535
00:26:29,168 --> 00:26:32,921
Everybody was so nice to me.
Everybody made you feel at home.

536
00:26:32,922 --> 00:26:35,674
I had a chance to...

537
00:26:35,675 --> 00:26:38,043
<i>look around</i>
<i>a little bit.</i>

538
00:26:38,044 --> 00:26:42,514
And somewhere in there
he disappeared.

539
00:26:45,118 --> 00:26:47,887
And I found myself

540
00:26:47,888 --> 00:26:51,190
with a construction worker
from Connecticut.

541
00:26:51,191 --> 00:26:53,593
<i># at Plato's Retreat #</i>

542
00:26:53,594 --> 00:26:56,395
<i># you can make your dreams</i>
<i>come true #</i>

543
00:26:56,396 --> 00:26:59,599
<i># fulfill your wildest</i>
<i>fantasies #</i>

544
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,701
<i># we've got them all</i>
<i>for you... #</i>

545
00:27:01,702 --> 00:27:03,769
She was nuts,
absolutely wild.

546
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:06,572
She goes, "Oooh,
pussy loves cock.
Pussy loves cock."

547
00:27:06,573 --> 00:27:09,675
Unbelievable-- a maniac.
I said, "this is my kind
of place."

548
00:27:09,676 --> 00:27:12,161
<i># the pleasure</i>
<i>and the fun #</i>

549
00:27:12,162 --> 00:27:14,580
<i># will keep you</i>
<i>feeling young #</i>

550
00:27:14,581 --> 00:27:17,266
<i># it's for you #</i>

551
00:27:17,267 --> 00:27:19,868
<i># it's for you... #</i>

552
00:27:19,869 --> 00:27:21,870
I was a young
good-looking kid, I guess,

553
00:27:21,871 --> 00:27:23,572
and several girls
came on to me

554
00:27:23,573 --> 00:27:25,641
and their boyfriends
weren't that attractive.

555
00:27:25,642 --> 00:27:28,677
and if you had to go with one--
you had to trade off.

556
00:27:28,678 --> 00:27:31,547
And she yelled at me,
she screamed at me,

557
00:27:31,548 --> 00:27:33,982
and I said, "Just do it!
Just do it."

558
00:27:33,983 --> 00:27:36,117
You know?
And...

559
00:27:36,118 --> 00:27:37,820
we didn't talk much
after that.

560
00:27:37,821 --> 00:27:39,705
<i># the pleasure</i>
<i>and the fun #</i>

561
00:27:39,706 --> 00:27:41,857
<i># will keep you</i>
<i>feeling young #</i>

562
00:27:41,858 --> 00:27:43,375
<i># it's for you #</i>

563
00:27:43,376 --> 00:27:44,993
<i># it's for you... #</i>

564
00:27:44,994 --> 00:27:47,179
He was a wonderful lover.

565
00:27:48,848 --> 00:27:52,618
And I said to myself,
"People who come to
Plato's Retreat

566
00:27:52,619 --> 00:27:55,821
must be pretty good lovers,"
because this man had been.

567
00:27:55,822 --> 00:27:57,122
Um...

568
00:27:58,258 --> 00:28:01,560
<i># it's for you! #</i>

569
00:28:01,561 --> 00:28:03,946
I wanted to tell the people
I grew up with,

570
00:28:03,947 --> 00:28:07,015
like, no, I came
from a neighborhood
in Queens, New York.

571
00:28:07,016 --> 00:28:09,452
But you couldn't tell--
you couldn't talk about

572
00:28:09,453 --> 00:28:13,388
that kind of thing with guys
from the neighborhood because
they wouldn't believe you.

573
00:28:13,389 --> 00:28:15,424
To be honest,

574
00:28:15,425 --> 00:28:18,761
it was going out
on an edge for me.

575
00:28:18,762 --> 00:28:21,397
It was a very edgy
thing to do

576
00:28:21,398 --> 00:28:25,100
to...

577
00:28:25,101 --> 00:28:27,803
you know, spend an evening
in Plato's Retreat.

578
00:28:27,804 --> 00:28:30,956
There was this
attractive mulatto woman

579
00:28:30,957 --> 00:28:34,593
going down on her man
with her ass up in the air.

580
00:28:34,594 --> 00:28:37,129
I sat down

581
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:40,666
on the mattress next to her
and started stroking her.

582
00:28:40,667 --> 00:28:44,402
No opposition, so I--

583
00:28:44,403 --> 00:28:47,740
I guess, you know,
stuck my cock in her pussy

584
00:28:47,741 --> 00:28:49,808
and screwed her.

585
00:28:49,809 --> 00:28:53,512
And she didn't even look back.
She was too busy blowing
her boyfriend.

586
00:28:57,483 --> 00:29:00,452
I hope I'm not
being too vulgar.

587
00:29:01,822 --> 00:29:04,156
The minister and I...

588
00:29:04,157 --> 00:29:07,292
did hook up sometime
during that evening.

589
00:29:07,293 --> 00:29:10,730
But I don't remember when.

590
00:29:12,366 --> 00:29:14,132
- Which is telling.
- <i>Phil?</i>

591
00:29:14,133 --> 00:29:17,486
Yeah-- yes, Larry Levenson,
Plato's Retreat.

592
00:29:17,487 --> 00:29:19,038
I can speak for Plato's

593
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,673
and we get about
50% new couples
every night.

594
00:29:21,674 --> 00:29:24,760
<i>We have disco dancing--</i>
<i>in fact we have a song</i>

595
00:29:24,761 --> 00:29:27,462
about Plato's Retreat that's
number six in the country
right now.

596
00:29:32,151 --> 00:29:34,787
<i>I met people years later</i>
<i>who said things like,</i>

597
00:29:34,788 --> 00:29:37,173
"oh, I went in there.
I went to Plato's."

598
00:29:37,174 --> 00:29:40,693
<i>I went to Plato's, you know?</i>
<i>It became part of the memoir.</i>

599
00:29:40,694 --> 00:29:43,328
You know?
That was exciting in itself.

600
00:29:43,329 --> 00:29:45,697
We had judges, lawyers,
police--

601
00:29:45,698 --> 00:29:47,466
- Senators.
- Senators.

602
00:29:47,467 --> 00:29:49,518
<i>Robin Leach who was...</i>

603
00:29:51,554 --> 00:29:53,154
He was there just to look.

604
00:29:53,155 --> 00:29:55,290
Students met
their professors,

605
00:29:55,291 --> 00:29:57,759
guys met their ex-wives,

606
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,528
future wives.

607
00:29:59,529 --> 00:30:01,897
Sammy Davis, JR.
on the dance floor

608
00:30:01,898 --> 00:30:04,232
at Plato's Retreat,
it was a treat.

609
00:30:04,233 --> 00:30:06,969
<i>They'd tell me</i>
<i>this guy was a big star-- </i>

610
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:08,854
Frank Sinatra's friend,
you know.

611
00:30:08,855 --> 00:30:10,839
- Althea, his wife...
- Althea, his wife.

612
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,174
...pulled her shirt up.

613
00:30:12,175 --> 00:30:14,893
Oh, man, how could
I forget his name?

614
00:30:14,894 --> 00:30:17,796
He's a writer--
Hugh Hefner's friend,

615
00:30:17,797 --> 00:30:19,665
he committed suicide...

616
00:30:19,666 --> 00:30:21,499
Jerzy Kosinski.

617
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,702
Much of the cast
of "Saturday Night Live."

618
00:30:23,703 --> 00:30:26,221
What's his name?
Dreyf-- Richard Dreyfuss.

619
00:30:26,222 --> 00:30:28,173
He never came down
with a lady.

620
00:30:28,174 --> 00:30:30,709
Again he was invited
to stay.

621
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:33,162
<i>Dan Pastorini was</i>
<i>having a big year</i>

622
00:30:33,163 --> 00:30:36,464
with the Houston Oilers.
And the men recognize him.

623
00:30:36,465 --> 00:30:39,301
And the men started,
"It's Dan Pastorini!
It's Dan Pastorini!"

624
00:30:39,302 --> 00:30:42,404
And just immediately
grabbing their wives

625
00:30:42,405 --> 00:30:44,372
and just-- you know,

626
00:30:44,373 --> 00:30:46,141
"fuck Dan Pastorini!"

627
00:30:46,142 --> 00:30:50,863
<i>Why did you decide</i>
<i>in early 1973</i>

628
00:30:50,864 --> 00:30:52,581
<i>to go underground?</i>

629
00:30:52,582 --> 00:30:56,184
There was no way that I could
possibly get a fair trial.

630
00:30:56,185 --> 00:30:58,737
<i>Abbie Hoffman was</i>
<i>underground,</i>

631
00:30:58,738 --> 00:31:00,505
<i>running from the FBI,</i>
<i>basically.</i>

632
00:31:00,506 --> 00:31:04,526
And one of these times
I got a phone call from him
saying, "I'm in town.

633
00:31:04,527 --> 00:31:08,964
And I've been reading
all about Plato's

634
00:31:08,965 --> 00:31:12,868
in your column
in the 'Voice' and I want
to go to Plato's Retreat."

635
00:31:12,869 --> 00:31:15,503
And I said, "are you
out of your mind?"

636
00:31:15,504 --> 00:31:19,625
This is where we're working
on the new constitution.

637
00:31:19,626 --> 00:31:22,127
<i>And he said, "no no no,</i>
<i> I gotta go. </i> <i>I gotta go.</i>

638
00:31:22,128 --> 00:31:24,096
I gotta go there.
I gotta see it.

639
00:31:24,097 --> 00:31:26,031
I can't miss this."

640
00:31:26,032 --> 00:31:28,316
He comes over after awhile
and he says,

641
00:31:28,317 --> 00:31:31,286
"Can't I tell them who I am?
I mean, they-- they--

642
00:31:31,287 --> 00:31:34,857
they just walk away from me.
I thought you said everybody
gets laid here."

643
00:31:34,858 --> 00:31:39,177
I said, "go ahead, but I think
it's really dangerous."

644
00:31:39,178 --> 00:31:42,381
Abbie was one
of the first people

645
00:31:42,382 --> 00:31:45,417
that I knew that couldn't
get laid at Plato's.

646
00:31:46,886 --> 00:31:49,655
I probably wouldn't have gone
as many times as I did,

647
00:31:49,656 --> 00:31:52,123
but friends from California
kept asking me

648
00:31:52,124 --> 00:31:53,759
to walk them in.

649
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,944
I was wondering, do you get
a lot of curiosity seekers,

650
00:31:55,945 --> 00:31:57,713
people that just like
to go and watch?

651
00:31:57,714 --> 00:31:59,982
- <i>Yes, voyeurs,</i>
<i>definitely.</i>
- Like me.

652
00:31:59,983 --> 00:32:02,317
Yes, there's no pressure,
there's no obligation

653
00:32:02,318 --> 00:32:04,486
and no commitment to do
anything at our club.

654
00:32:04,487 --> 00:32:06,922
And I'm positive
it's the same way
at Larry's club.

655
00:32:06,923 --> 00:32:09,607
<i>I come for...</i>

656
00:32:09,608 --> 00:32:12,294
sex, good conversation,

657
00:32:12,295 --> 00:32:14,262
intellect.

658
00:32:16,516 --> 00:32:19,318
<i>The only rule, actually,</i>
<i>in the entire club was no.</i>

659
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,154
<i>If somebody said no,</i>
<i>that was it.</i>

660
00:32:23,155 --> 00:32:25,357
But if they allowed it,
anything went.

661
00:32:25,358 --> 00:32:28,777
Females first.
They set the rule.

662
00:32:28,778 --> 00:32:31,280
If they want to be touched,
that's fine.

663
00:32:31,281 --> 00:32:33,982
They don't want to be touched,
they're not gonna be touched.

664
00:32:33,983 --> 00:32:35,651
If she wants to walk around
with her top off...

665
00:32:38,388 --> 00:32:42,090
she walks around
with her top off.
That was it.

666
00:32:42,091 --> 00:32:44,843
I think at Plato's it was
kind of interesting that women

667
00:32:44,844 --> 00:32:47,979
<i>were really in a position</i>
<i>to be assertive,</i>

668
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:50,983
<i>to approach men for sex,</i>

669
00:32:50,984 --> 00:32:53,218
<i>to kind of try out a lot</i>
<i>of the things</i>

670
00:32:53,219 --> 00:32:55,954
that we had been
on the receiving end of.

671
00:32:55,955 --> 00:32:59,341
It was yummy. Why let
them have all the pleasure?

672
00:32:59,342 --> 00:33:02,845
Why even pretend that you
didn't feel good about it

673
00:33:02,846 --> 00:33:05,881
and you didn't have a good time
when you were sexually involved?

674
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,568
<i>The whole thing</i>
<i>with Plato's is</i>

675
00:33:10,569 --> 00:33:12,804
<i>that you would walk</i>
<i>into this space,</i>

676
00:33:12,805 --> 00:33:15,940
<i>and whether or not</i>
<i>you had sex with anyone</i>
<i>was really not the point.</i>

677
00:33:15,941 --> 00:33:18,410
The point was is that
everybody there

678
00:33:18,411 --> 00:33:21,279
was willing to be nude,

679
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,599
<i>available maybe for sex</i>

680
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,418
and open.

681
00:33:26,419 --> 00:33:29,370
Sex with another man
is a fantasy of mine.

682
00:33:29,371 --> 00:33:31,973
I'm someone else.
It's an ego trip.

683
00:33:31,974 --> 00:33:34,342
I think
that's exactly what it is.
It's an ego trip

684
00:33:34,343 --> 00:33:37,296
<i>having some other man,</i>
<i>other than my husband,</i>
<i>telling me "you're beautiful.</i>

685
00:33:37,297 --> 00:33:40,215
You're good in bed."
all this, you know?

686
00:33:40,216 --> 00:33:42,184
It's really
a fantasy for me.

687
00:33:42,185 --> 00:33:44,436
And it also felt like
you had a secret,

688
00:33:44,437 --> 00:33:46,304
that you had a secret world

689
00:33:46,305 --> 00:33:48,807
that most of the people
who were either going to work

690
00:33:48,808 --> 00:33:51,076
or just going about
their business in the city

691
00:33:51,077 --> 00:33:53,578
that they didn't know
what you had experienced.

692
00:33:53,579 --> 00:33:56,698
Again, it's not just sex.
It's not going in there

693
00:33:56,699 --> 00:33:59,467
and say, "I'm going
in there 'cause I just want
to grab somebody

694
00:33:59,468 --> 00:34:01,503
and I wanna..."

695
00:34:01,504 --> 00:34:03,405
Can I say certain words?
Okay.

696
00:34:03,406 --> 00:34:04,906
"...get laid."

697
00:34:04,907 --> 00:34:07,659
I was a social worker
in 1978.

698
00:34:09,162 --> 00:34:12,664
But I had good evenings
after my social work.

699
00:34:14,633 --> 00:34:16,885
<i># oh, how happy #</i>

700
00:34:16,886 --> 00:34:20,155
<i># you have made me #</i>

701
00:34:20,156 --> 00:34:22,924
<i># oh, how happy #</i>

702
00:34:22,925 --> 00:34:25,160
<i># you have made me #</i>

703
00:34:25,161 --> 00:34:27,763
<i># I have kissed</i>
<i>your lips #</i>

704
00:34:27,764 --> 00:34:29,731
<i># a thousand times... #</i>

705
00:34:29,732 --> 00:34:32,250
<i>I remember once,</i>
<i>this couple--</i>

706
00:34:32,251 --> 00:34:35,487
<i>I'm sure they've been</i>
<i>thrown out of every swingers</i>
<i>club in the world</i>

707
00:34:35,488 --> 00:34:38,723
<i>because they were so large.</i>
<i>They had to weigh 300 lbs each.</i>

708
00:34:38,724 --> 00:34:41,843
<i>And they were jitterbugging.</i>
<i>They were dancing.</i>

709
00:34:41,844 --> 00:34:45,213
<i>They had on their towels.</i>
<i>They had to have double towels</i>

710
00:34:45,214 --> 00:34:47,949
<i>around them.</i>
<i>And the towels,</i>
<i>of course, fell off.</i>

711
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:50,919
And then nobody gave
a doo-doo-caca.

712
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,022
But what happened was--
it was when they stomped,

713
00:34:54,023 --> 00:34:57,659
they were shaking the--
the-- the--

714
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,261
the Platters for the DJ
because they weighed so much.

715
00:35:00,262 --> 00:35:02,631
I mean, they were shaking
the whole damn floor.

716
00:35:02,632 --> 00:35:04,365
But it was--
nobody cared.

717
00:35:04,366 --> 00:35:06,468
It was really
very very nice.

718
00:35:06,469 --> 00:35:08,804
This was
Larry Levenson's castle.

719
00:35:08,805 --> 00:35:12,808
Plato's Retreat was the way
that Larry could

720
00:35:12,809 --> 00:35:15,744
embrace everybody
and-- and--

721
00:35:15,745 --> 00:35:18,813
exude his generosity,
his bounty.

722
00:35:18,814 --> 00:35:21,783
Family togetherness today
at a place called
Plato's Retreat.

723
00:35:21,784 --> 00:35:25,137
This afternoon the owner
held an open house there
for children.

724
00:35:25,138 --> 00:35:28,340
<i>In most cases</i>
<i>it was a family affair</i>
<i>at Plato's today...</i>

725
00:35:28,341 --> 00:35:30,725
<i>The first time I</i>
<i>actually went</i>

726
00:35:30,726 --> 00:35:32,210
<i>to the club,</i>
<i>the club was closed.</i>

727
00:35:32,211 --> 00:35:34,863
My father used to run,
like, holiday parties--

728
00:35:34,864 --> 00:35:36,965
Memorial Day, Labor Day.

729
00:35:36,966 --> 00:35:40,535
He would actually rent
the big bus, have it parked
at my high school.

730
00:35:40,536 --> 00:35:42,804
I would invite 40
of my best friends.

731
00:35:42,805 --> 00:35:45,573
- <i>Do you mind that</i>
<i> your mother comes here?</i>
- No, I don't care.

732
00:35:45,574 --> 00:35:49,094
He had a disco
and there was a game room there.

733
00:35:49,095 --> 00:35:52,197
Everything was
the same as if it was open,
except there was no nudity

734
00:35:52,198 --> 00:35:53,865
or no sex.
It was a bunch of kids.

735
00:35:53,866 --> 00:35:56,451
That's when we
started understanding

736
00:35:56,452 --> 00:35:59,620
what everything was about.

737
00:35:59,621 --> 00:36:02,340
He used to be called-- what?
King of Swing.

738
00:36:02,341 --> 00:36:05,710
Yeah, that's right.
He was called King
of Swing.

739
00:36:05,711 --> 00:36:07,446
<i># at Plato's Retreat... #</i>

740
00:36:07,447 --> 00:36:09,648
Larry, let us
into your heart a minute.

741
00:36:09,649 --> 00:36:12,467
A lot of people
are saying Larry Levenson,

742
00:36:12,468 --> 00:36:14,335
<i>a lot of people</i>
<i>say sleaze.</i>

743
00:36:14,336 --> 00:36:17,739
<i>I heard the President's</i>
<i>speech the other night.</i>
<i>He talked about truth,</i>

744
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:20,575
<i>service, sacrifice,</i>
<i>the American dream.</i>

745
00:36:20,576 --> 00:36:23,845
And then we see in this
country a disintegration
of the American family--

746
00:36:23,846 --> 00:36:26,915
That's what you're really
telling us. That's what
Plato's Retreat

747
00:36:26,916 --> 00:36:29,184
- is about--
or monogamy is dead.
- Oh no.

748
00:36:29,185 --> 00:36:30,818
- <i>No!</i>
- <i>I'm saying that--</i>

749
00:36:30,819 --> 00:36:33,422
<i>This is a preservation</i>
<i>in a sense, Stanley.</i>

750
00:36:33,423 --> 00:36:35,140
Don't you realize
how many men say

751
00:36:35,141 --> 00:36:37,476
"I'm going out
with the boys tonight,"

752
00:36:37,477 --> 00:36:39,511
- And they cheat and they lie?
- The question is

753
00:36:39,512 --> 00:36:41,213
why aren't you in jail?

754
00:36:42,582 --> 00:36:44,983
We're here at
the New York Aquarium now.

755
00:36:44,984 --> 00:36:49,921
- Watching orca Shamu
do his thing.

756
00:36:49,922 --> 00:36:52,340
Larry, you know, I've never
really gotten a chance
to talk to you.

757
00:36:52,341 --> 00:36:55,193
Why don't you play
with my ass and tell me
your philosophy of life?

758
00:36:56,479 --> 00:36:58,780
<i>Whoo!</i>

759
00:36:58,781 --> 00:37:02,451
- <i>Oh my god, he's doing it.</i>
- <i>Larry got involved</i>
<i> with younger women,</i>

760
00:37:02,452 --> 00:37:06,454
wanted to hang out
with these women that took
him for his money--

761
00:37:06,455 --> 00:37:08,657
the money he didn't have

762
00:37:08,658 --> 00:37:11,026
and the drugs he did have.

763
00:37:11,027 --> 00:37:13,979
Larry was boring
because he thought

764
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:16,047
his whole world was sex.

765
00:37:16,048 --> 00:37:19,050
His world
was genitalia.

766
00:37:19,051 --> 00:37:21,286
Again,
he never read a book.

767
00:37:21,287 --> 00:37:25,323
He never had a thought.
It was all about him
as a legend.

768
00:37:25,324 --> 00:37:28,610
He really thought
that when it came to swinging

769
00:37:28,611 --> 00:37:32,280
he was-- everyone looked at him
as "The King" literally.

770
00:37:32,281 --> 00:37:34,883
We got people
from Fort Lauderdale.
We got people from California.

771
00:37:34,884 --> 00:37:38,503
We got people from Paris,
France, coming to Plato's.
They fly in.

772
00:37:38,504 --> 00:37:40,839
<i>We're the eighth wonder</i>
<i>of the world.</i>
<i>Okay?</i>

773
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,241
I think it's different,
but I don't think
it's immoral.

774
00:37:43,242 --> 00:37:46,177
<i>This is the biggest thing</i>
<i>to hit New York city since</i>
<i>the World's Fair.</i>

775
00:37:46,178 --> 00:37:47,212
And it is.

776
00:37:52,635 --> 00:37:55,369
<i>The interesting thing</i>
<i>about Larry was</i>

777
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:57,572
The guy was getting social
security checks.

778
00:37:57,573 --> 00:37:59,307
He didn't have any money,

779
00:37:59,308 --> 00:38:02,310
yet he was able
to borrow $150,000.

780
00:38:02,311 --> 00:38:05,046
Where does a guy
get $150,000?

781
00:38:10,336 --> 00:38:12,137
<i>He was Colonel Sanders</i>

782
00:38:12,138 --> 00:38:14,406
<i>and he had to do</i>
<i>his little step--</i>

783
00:38:14,407 --> 00:38:16,391
Step-and-fix-it routine.

784
00:38:16,392 --> 00:38:19,244
<i>Is it your view we're gonna</i>
<i>have Plato's Retreats--</i>

785
00:38:19,245 --> 00:38:21,746
it's gonna be part of
Oshkosh, Wisconsin, too someday?

786
00:38:21,747 --> 00:38:26,484
Within the next three months
there will be four more Plato's
Retreats around the country.

787
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,741
Larry started to believe
the bullshit.

788
00:38:33,742 --> 00:38:36,744
I bullshit all the time
when I'm interviewing.

789
00:38:36,745 --> 00:38:41,049
Larry did too, but Larry
exaggerated the importance.

790
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:43,584
I always argued,
"It's just fucking."

791
00:38:43,585 --> 00:38:46,421
What is fucking?
It's friction.

792
00:38:46,422 --> 00:38:49,340
You believe
in a free society?

793
00:38:49,341 --> 00:38:51,810
A free society where people
can just have a good time

794
00:38:51,811 --> 00:38:55,180
and enjoy themselves
the way they want to,
without hurting anybody else.

795
00:38:56,849 --> 00:38:58,850
It's a devastating therapy.

796
00:38:58,851 --> 00:39:01,169
- <i>But it works for them.</i>
- <i>Is it for them?</i>

797
00:39:05,742 --> 00:39:08,994
<i>I saw a fight between a couple</i>
<i>there at Plato's once</i>

798
00:39:08,995 --> 00:39:11,996
<i>where the husband</i>
<i>had found out</i>

799
00:39:11,997 --> 00:39:15,834
<i>that his wife had</i>
<i>mended the pants</i>

800
00:39:15,835 --> 00:39:18,170
<i>for a man who was there.</i>

801
00:39:18,171 --> 00:39:20,738
<i>And in fact</i>
<i>they'd had sex many times,</i>

802
00:39:20,739 --> 00:39:24,042
but it was this little
personal touch that
showed affection

803
00:39:24,043 --> 00:39:26,011
that made
the husband insane.

804
00:39:26,012 --> 00:39:28,780
I could never
bring somebody special,
somebody I cared about there.

805
00:39:28,781 --> 00:39:32,183
I couldn't handle my wife
or my girlfriend being
with somebody else.

806
00:39:32,184 --> 00:39:34,519
And me
sitting and watching?

807
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,872
You really did see
that sometimes

808
00:39:37,873 --> 00:39:41,943
that what they came out for
bit them in the behind.

809
00:39:41,944 --> 00:39:44,946
They got more than what
they really bargained for.

810
00:39:44,947 --> 00:39:47,265
If I wanted to have an affair
with a man or sleep with a man

811
00:39:47,266 --> 00:39:50,818
that I felt attractive,
I can do it.

812
00:39:50,819 --> 00:39:52,387
And Michael knows about it.

813
00:39:52,388 --> 00:39:54,072
It's like dual infidelity.

814
00:39:57,143 --> 00:40:00,645
<i>Do you think Larry is faithful</i>
<i>to you out of Plato's Retreat?</i>

815
00:40:00,646 --> 00:40:02,731
For example,
is he with other women,
do you think?

816
00:40:02,732 --> 00:40:04,565
- <i>Yes, very definitely.</i>
- How do you know?

817
00:40:04,566 --> 00:40:06,034
- I don't have time.
- Trust.

818
00:40:07,686 --> 00:40:09,855
I believe Mary...

819
00:40:09,856 --> 00:40:12,357
Always had feelings
for Larry.

820
00:40:13,893 --> 00:40:16,962
I think her whole life
was wrapped around him,

821
00:40:16,963 --> 00:40:19,264
wrapped around the lifestyle.

822
00:40:19,265 --> 00:40:23,568
Most people look at Plato's
as the new sexual lifestyle

823
00:40:23,569 --> 00:40:24,969
of the 21st century.

824
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:26,788
Honestly
what most people feel--

825
00:40:26,789 --> 00:40:28,456
I know this is
another judgment--

826
00:40:28,457 --> 00:40:31,393
they feel something's
gone wrong here.

827
00:40:31,394 --> 00:40:33,194
<i>Well, maybe something has.</i>

828
00:40:33,195 --> 00:40:36,882
Maybe every marriage
in this country has a little
something wrong with it.

829
00:40:36,883 --> 00:40:39,650
She knew the people.
She knew the crowd.

830
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,221
And I think,
like anything else,

831
00:40:43,222 --> 00:40:46,157
too much of something

832
00:40:46,158 --> 00:40:48,226
could freak you out.

833
00:40:48,227 --> 00:40:50,828
There was no Mary room.
There was no...

834
00:40:50,829 --> 00:40:53,598
fancy room where Mary could
sit up there and be queen

835
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:55,567
and men would come
and court her.

836
00:40:55,568 --> 00:40:58,703
They seemed to have
a respectful relationship
for a time.

837
00:41:01,674 --> 00:41:04,009
I don't have much more
to add about that.

838
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:05,944
No, I don't remember
much more-- same.

839
00:41:05,945 --> 00:41:07,612
- Are you married?
- No, uh...

840
00:41:07,613 --> 00:41:09,414
- We were-- I was--
- <i>Are you married?</i>

841
00:41:09,415 --> 00:41:11,550
--in strictly
monogamous relationships.

842
00:41:11,551 --> 00:41:13,151
- In a sense--
- <i>You don't hear me.</i>

843
00:41:13,152 --> 00:41:14,886
--In a sense, David,
we are married

844
00:41:14,887 --> 00:41:17,121
because I intend to spend
the rest of my life
with Larry

845
00:41:17,122 --> 00:41:19,323
whether he likes it
or not, but, uh...

846
00:41:19,324 --> 00:41:21,927
- <i>But technically no?</i>
- Technically no, we're not.

847
00:41:24,162 --> 00:41:26,063
<i>What is the address</i>
<i>of the new Plato's</i>

848
00:41:26,064 --> 00:41:27,998
<i>and what is the opening date?</i>

849
00:41:27,999 --> 00:41:31,019
The grand opening will be
December 5th, on a Friday night
at 9:00 P.M.

850
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:33,170
That's of this year,
of course.

851
00:41:37,943 --> 00:41:40,895
When the 34th street
location opened,

852
00:41:40,896 --> 00:41:42,531
it was hopping.

853
00:41:42,532 --> 00:41:44,165
<i>This is the matt room.</i>

854
00:41:44,166 --> 00:41:46,801
<i>This is a place where you</i>
<i>get 20, 30 couples in here</i>
<i>at one time.</i>

855
00:41:46,802 --> 00:41:49,654
You must be
undressed to come in here.
It's a beautiful sight.

856
00:41:49,655 --> 00:41:53,575
<i>It was located directly</i>
<i>across from McDonald's.</i>

857
00:41:53,576 --> 00:41:57,662
And people used to say it had
become the McDonald's of sex.

858
00:42:05,738 --> 00:42:08,006
<i>I was this normal</i>
<i>housewife person.</i>

859
00:42:08,007 --> 00:42:10,541
<i>My husband left,</i>
<i>his girlfriend was</i>
<i>having a baby.</i>

860
00:42:13,045 --> 00:42:16,531
And you meet different people.
I was working at the movie
theater in the village.

861
00:42:16,532 --> 00:42:18,900
<i>I was selling the tickets</i>
<i>to "Rocky Horror."</i>

862
00:42:18,901 --> 00:42:21,769
And the first time I went
to Plato's, it seemed people--

863
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:24,873
like actually doing
something in the open,

864
00:42:24,874 --> 00:42:27,308
you just-- you don't
believe what you saw.

865
00:42:32,347 --> 00:42:34,899
<i>Because it was like</i>
<i>turning a page in a magazine</i>

866
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,801
<i>and you're</i>
<i>sitting there</i>

867
00:42:36,802 --> 00:42:39,254
<i>and then you</i>
<i>make up your mind.</i>

868
00:42:39,255 --> 00:42:41,572
You know, you're either
into it or you're not.

869
00:42:41,573 --> 00:42:43,274
And I was into it.

870
00:42:47,246 --> 00:42:50,048
<i>One time I was standing there</i>
<i>by the ladies' room</i>

871
00:42:50,049 --> 00:42:52,450
in the back
and a young girl
came up to me,

872
00:42:52,451 --> 00:42:56,021
and she said to me,
"are you outrageous?"

873
00:42:56,022 --> 00:42:59,390
<i>And I said, "yes, I am."</i>
<i>and with that I put my hand</i>
<i>on her breast.</i>

874
00:42:59,391 --> 00:43:01,659
<i>She said, "perhaps you'd</i>
<i>like to join us?"</i>

875
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,862
I said, "oh,
thank you very much"

876
00:43:03,863 --> 00:43:06,765
and I was invited to go
in this room with seven
other ladies.

877
00:43:10,036 --> 00:43:12,837
<i>Another time I was there</i>
<i>with a young gentleman</i>

878
00:43:12,838 --> 00:43:15,773
<i>and he knew this couple:</i>

879
00:43:15,774 --> 00:43:18,910
<i>The lady was Chinese,</i>
<i>the husband was a white</i>
<i>gentleman.</i>

880
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:21,563
And he said to me, "You want
to do something with them?

881
00:43:21,564 --> 00:43:24,131
The husband doesn't do anything.
He just sits in the corner.

882
00:43:24,132 --> 00:43:26,468
We could be with the lady,
the three of us."

883
00:43:26,469 --> 00:43:28,903
And I said okay.

884
00:43:28,904 --> 00:43:31,806
And the husband just
sat there in the corner.

885
00:43:33,158 --> 00:43:36,044
Like touching
his wife's shoulder,

886
00:43:36,045 --> 00:43:38,212
but not joining in.

887
00:43:39,431 --> 00:43:42,667
I was going to be
President of the P.T.A.

888
00:43:42,668 --> 00:43:46,171
What do you want out
of your life that you're
not getting from Mary?

889
00:43:46,172 --> 00:43:48,856
That I am not
getting from Mary?
There is no man in the world

890
00:43:48,857 --> 00:43:50,725
that can say that
his woman gives him

891
00:43:50,726 --> 00:43:53,094
<i>every need that he has--</i>
<i>that there is to have.</i>

892
00:43:53,095 --> 00:43:55,713
I want as much as I can possibly
have in this lifetime.

893
00:43:55,714 --> 00:43:57,982
And that's what I'm doing.
I'm enjoying myself,

894
00:43:57,983 --> 00:44:00,018
I'm happy
and that's the bottom line.

895
00:44:00,019 --> 00:44:03,271
<i>One of his constant refrains</i>
<i>whenever he was interviewed</i>

896
00:44:03,272 --> 00:44:05,039
<i>or talked to anybody was</i>

897
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,476
swinging and Plato's will
not save a bad marriage.

898
00:44:08,477 --> 00:44:12,046
It's something extra you do
in a great marriage for fun.

899
00:44:12,047 --> 00:44:15,216
As swinging was explained to me
by him when I was a kid

900
00:44:15,217 --> 00:44:17,251
was: There is no jealousy.

901
00:44:17,252 --> 00:44:21,322
You know?
Swinging is a thing
where couples are

902
00:44:21,323 --> 00:44:23,491
in a relationship
with each other.

903
00:44:23,492 --> 00:44:26,360
Okay?
They have feelings
for each other

904
00:44:26,361 --> 00:44:28,963
as if non-swingers do.

905
00:44:28,964 --> 00:44:30,798
But the only difference is

906
00:44:30,799 --> 00:44:33,067
that when they're
with someone else,

907
00:44:33,068 --> 00:44:35,436
it's just sex.
There's no feelings.

908
00:44:37,657 --> 00:44:40,425
<i>I never saw him</i>
<i>going around with Mary.</i>

909
00:44:40,426 --> 00:44:43,628
<i>I never saw them having sex</i>
<i>with other couples.</i>

910
00:44:43,629 --> 00:44:45,814
It was always Larry.

911
00:44:45,815 --> 00:44:47,865
Do you have relationships
with other men there?

912
00:44:47,866 --> 00:44:50,167
- Occasionally, yes.
- Does he know about it?

913
00:44:50,168 --> 00:44:52,103
Yes.

914
00:44:52,104 --> 00:44:54,889
- Do you countenance it?
- I think it's fantastic.

915
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:57,258
<i>Mary would be having</i>
<i>a lot of men.</i>

916
00:44:57,259 --> 00:45:00,628
<i>You weren't really</i>
<i>supposed to have a gangbang</i>
<i>just out on the main floor.</i>

917
00:45:00,629 --> 00:45:04,482
You were supposed to go
somewhere, and Larry might
speak to Mary about it,

918
00:45:04,483 --> 00:45:07,585
and then he'd go off and--
ohhh-- you know,

919
00:45:07,586 --> 00:45:10,488
and say, "Mary's upset."

920
00:45:10,489 --> 00:45:14,191
We'd say, "Mary doesn't
look upset. Mary looks like
she's having a good time."

921
00:45:14,192 --> 00:45:15,893
"No, Mary's upset."

922
00:45:18,214 --> 00:45:20,214
<i>She was losing Larry,</i>

923
00:45:20,215 --> 00:45:24,685
not just to the lifestyle,
but to one particular
woman or another.

924
00:45:24,686 --> 00:45:27,354
Do you really believe
that you can make love
to a person one time

925
00:45:27,355 --> 00:45:29,858
and fall in love with them?
I don't think it can happen.

926
00:45:29,859 --> 00:45:31,759
I really don't.
I've never seen it happen.

927
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,462
He was there
just to have sex.

928
00:45:34,463 --> 00:45:38,800
The whole thing was how many
women he could get.

929
00:45:40,352 --> 00:45:43,154
<i>She wasn't having it</i>
<i>and I don't blame her.</i>

930
00:45:43,155 --> 00:45:48,225
<i>So she went on with this affair</i>
<i>with the chauffeur.</i>

931
00:45:48,226 --> 00:45:50,244
Mary and Larry
were-- were--

932
00:45:50,245 --> 00:45:52,963
He was starting
to tell her to stay home,

933
00:45:52,964 --> 00:45:55,933
and the chauffeur knew
both of them

934
00:45:55,934 --> 00:45:59,036
because he used to drive
both of them to Plato's.

935
00:45:59,037 --> 00:46:01,139
It ended badly.

936
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:03,341
They wanted
to kill each other.

937
00:46:03,342 --> 00:46:05,676
The chauffeur was
in love with Mary.

938
00:46:05,677 --> 00:46:07,778
Larry was in love
with Mary.

939
00:46:07,779 --> 00:46:12,183
Mary was in love
with the chauffeur-- it was
this big nasty triangle.

940
00:46:12,184 --> 00:46:14,736
- Larry would send
Mary home with Ron.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

941
00:46:14,737 --> 00:46:16,938
So maybe one thing
led to another.

942
00:46:18,006 --> 00:46:20,508
I think in the end

943
00:46:20,509 --> 00:46:22,510
he...

944
00:46:22,511 --> 00:46:24,479
The chauffeur had Larry

945
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,914
kidnapped,
beaten to a pulp,

946
00:46:26,915 --> 00:46:29,216
sent--
put in the hospital

947
00:46:29,217 --> 00:46:32,119
in an effort to end it
in his favor.

948
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,421
That's what
I believe happened.

949
00:46:34,422 --> 00:46:37,242
- I never seen a guy
that was beat--
- So beat up.

950
00:46:37,243 --> 00:46:39,861
- I mean--
- His face was like
out to here.

951
00:46:43,548 --> 00:46:46,550
I think Larry Levenson
wound up in the hospital

952
00:46:46,551 --> 00:46:50,487
in Queens stemming
from this conflict

953
00:46:50,488 --> 00:46:52,924
between him, Mary
and the chauffeur.

954
00:46:52,925 --> 00:46:56,444
After the kidnapping,
Mary came by the club
a couple of times.

955
00:46:56,445 --> 00:46:59,413
You know, she seemed
basically out of it.

956
00:46:59,414 --> 00:47:03,017
You know, she was older
and at one point she might
have been the queen,

957
00:47:03,018 --> 00:47:04,552
but she definitely
wasn't now.

958
00:47:13,495 --> 00:47:15,830
<i>She almost wound up</i>
<i>on the street.</i>

959
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:19,233
<i>She was institutionalized,</i>
<i>I believe,</i>

960
00:47:19,234 --> 00:47:20,901
<i>at Bellevue</i>
<i>for a while</i>

961
00:47:20,902 --> 00:47:23,237
<i>and she did have</i>
<i>a breakdown.</i>

962
00:47:24,406 --> 00:47:27,408
She was really a nice woman.
Nice lady.

963
00:47:27,409 --> 00:47:29,744
Maybe they made up that story
that it was this guy

964
00:47:29,745 --> 00:47:31,746
- to stay away
from the wiseguys.
- Ron.

965
00:47:31,747 --> 00:47:33,248
We don't know.

966
00:47:33,249 --> 00:47:35,382
Why it happened,
we never knew.

967
00:47:39,487 --> 00:47:42,340
But even then Larry
was running around, like,
in a wheelchair

968
00:47:42,341 --> 00:47:45,075
and he was perfectly fine.
He was saying, "Aw,
it's nothing."

969
00:47:45,076 --> 00:47:47,111
I'll be fine.
I'll be walking."
and he was.

970
00:47:47,112 --> 00:47:49,847
He was, like,
smiling through it all.

971
00:47:49,848 --> 00:47:53,785
Plato's Retreat is
an unlicensed club

972
00:47:53,786 --> 00:47:57,205
- for swinging couples, right?
- <i>We have a charter.</i>

973
00:47:57,206 --> 00:47:59,941
In approximately
July of 1979,

974
00:47:59,942 --> 00:48:02,493
<i>there had been some</i>
<i>newspaper article</i>

975
00:48:02,494 --> 00:48:05,346
wherein Larry Levenson had

976
00:48:05,347 --> 00:48:07,381
stated and boasted that,

977
00:48:07,382 --> 00:48:10,217
"We don't pay taxes
for Plato's Retreat Inc."

978
00:48:10,218 --> 00:48:12,252
We are definitely
a non-profit corporation.

979
00:48:12,253 --> 00:48:15,356
- Now wait a minute, Larry.
What do you mean a non-profit?
- <i>I'm telling you.</i>

980
00:48:15,357 --> 00:48:18,726
<i>Two gentlemen appeared</i>

981
00:48:18,727 --> 00:48:21,228
9:00 in the morning.
I'm half asleep.

982
00:48:21,229 --> 00:48:25,299
And they says,
"We came here
to see the books."

983
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:27,635
So I gave them
the books.

984
00:48:29,988 --> 00:48:32,306
I didn't know they were
from the Internal Revenue.

985
00:48:35,377 --> 00:48:38,245
<i>And they find out they got</i>
<i>a gold mine in front of them,</i>

986
00:48:38,246 --> 00:48:41,499
that these people have been
cheating their income tax

987
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,016
for three years.

988
00:48:43,017 --> 00:48:46,520
In one year I think
they claimed only $300

989
00:48:46,521 --> 00:48:49,723
of taxable income
and paid zero tax.

990
00:48:49,724 --> 00:48:52,610
<i>Ann Grippo reentered</i>
<i>the business room.</i>

991
00:48:52,611 --> 00:48:56,547
<i>She looked over our shoulder</i>
<i>and was peering intently.</i>

992
00:48:56,548 --> 00:48:58,983
She just blurted out
voluntarily,

993
00:48:58,984 --> 00:49:00,885
"we're dead."

994
00:49:00,886 --> 00:49:03,037
I tried to take
the books away from them.

995
00:49:03,038 --> 00:49:05,573
- Yeah?
- And I did, I took the books.

996
00:49:05,574 --> 00:49:08,208
They didn't keep them.
They weren't allowed
to keep them.

997
00:49:08,209 --> 00:49:09,577
- Correct.
- I took them.

998
00:49:09,578 --> 00:49:11,545
- But now they know
that they have--
- Wait.

999
00:49:11,546 --> 00:49:13,881
- So now you got the books
back in your hand.
- Yeah.

1000
00:49:13,882 --> 00:49:16,767
- Did you call Larry?
- When they came in that night
I told them what happened.

1001
00:49:16,768 --> 00:49:19,036
- <i>You didn't do nothing</i>
<i> till that night?</i>
- No, till that night.

1002
00:49:19,037 --> 00:49:22,673
Hy said to me, "You know,
I covered our tracks here
for three years.

1003
00:49:22,674 --> 00:49:24,409
Now we're dead."

1004
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:27,778
There was nothing
I could say or do

1005
00:49:27,779 --> 00:49:30,047
except that,
"hey, I'm sorry."

1006
00:49:30,048 --> 00:49:33,600
When they came home that night,
they packed their bags
and they were gone.

1007
00:49:33,601 --> 00:49:37,238
<i>They were so terrified</i>
<i>that they were gonna</i>
<i>get whacked.</i>

1008
00:49:37,239 --> 00:49:41,142
I didn't hear
from them again--

1009
00:49:41,143 --> 00:49:42,910
It's funny.
I laugh because

1010
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:45,446
when I saw them again
it was on TV.

1011
00:49:45,447 --> 00:49:47,431
Come on up here, Grippos.

1012
00:49:47,432 --> 00:49:49,300
Charlie and Ann Grippo.

1013
00:49:49,301 --> 00:49:52,286
Welcome.
What did you yell, Charlie,
when you were running up here?

1014
00:49:52,287 --> 00:49:55,023
- We're coming!
- <i>We're coming and we'll</i>
<i> get it right</i>

1015
00:49:55,024 --> 00:49:57,058
<i>if it takes us all night.</i>

1016
00:49:57,059 --> 00:50:00,861
He went onto some kind
of quiz show in Vegas.

1017
00:50:00,862 --> 00:50:03,114
"Las Vegas Gambit."

1018
00:50:03,115 --> 00:50:04,715
- <i>You're from where?</i>
- New York City.

1019
00:50:04,716 --> 00:50:06,683
- <i>On vacation?</i>
- Yes.

1020
00:50:06,684 --> 00:50:09,003
<i>I don't think we're sitting</i>
<i>there five minutes.</i>

1021
00:50:09,004 --> 00:50:11,338
<i>Yeah, just about</i>
<i>five minutes we heard--</i>

1022
00:50:11,339 --> 00:50:13,257
<i>We get two cards</i>
<i>and it's blackjack.</i>

1023
00:50:14,993 --> 00:50:18,012
- <i>And you get $1,000.</i>
- And we win $1200.

1024
00:50:18,013 --> 00:50:19,547
Or $1,000.
She jumps up...

1025
00:50:23,585 --> 00:50:26,270
We're gonna
send you the tape.
Funny as hell.

1026
00:50:27,572 --> 00:50:28,973
Hysterical.

1027
00:50:29,975 --> 00:50:32,477
My baby.
Okay? Awww.

1028
00:50:32,478 --> 00:50:34,362
Baby, baby.

1029
00:50:34,363 --> 00:50:36,447
And I thought to myself,

1030
00:50:36,448 --> 00:50:39,183
"these guys are running
from the mob and here they are

1031
00:50:39,184 --> 00:50:42,086
advertising who they--"

1032
00:50:42,087 --> 00:50:45,223
- We got a trip
to the Super Bowl.
- <i>A washer-dryer.</i>

1033
00:50:45,224 --> 00:50:47,191
And what about the V.C--
not a V.C.R., that--

1034
00:50:47,192 --> 00:50:49,210
- A Betamax.
- <i>The Betamax.</i>

1035
00:50:49,211 --> 00:50:51,762
- We won a load of stuff.
- A load of stuff.

1036
00:51:00,305 --> 00:51:03,841
It was a trial.
On trial was Larry,

1037
00:51:03,842 --> 00:51:06,810
Hy, Frank,

1038
00:51:06,811 --> 00:51:08,362
the accountant.

1039
00:51:11,917 --> 00:51:16,020
Larry took the stand
and tried to explain

1040
00:51:16,021 --> 00:51:17,721
the circumstances.

1041
00:51:17,722 --> 00:51:20,808
He believed that he was
in a-- a non-profit,

1042
00:51:20,809 --> 00:51:25,046
not-for-profit club
and that he truly believed that.

1043
00:51:25,047 --> 00:51:27,765
Larry Levenson wasn't
on the stand.

1044
00:51:27,766 --> 00:51:29,634
<i>He was on the stage.</i>

1045
00:51:29,635 --> 00:51:32,636
<i>Everything was a joke to him,</i>
<i>or so it appeared.</i>

1046
00:51:32,637 --> 00:51:36,040
<i>I think the jury, as I recall,</i>
<i>was laughing at him.</i>

1047
00:51:36,041 --> 00:51:38,142
The trial was completed.
The jury deliberated

1048
00:51:38,143 --> 00:51:40,677
for approximately five
or six hours, I believe.

1049
00:51:40,678 --> 00:51:43,180
And came back
with guilty verdicts.

1050
00:51:49,888 --> 00:51:53,824
Larry Levenson, Frank Pernice,
Hy Gordon received eight years
plus a fine.

1051
00:51:53,825 --> 00:51:56,310
I think an eight-year
jail sentence at that time

1052
00:51:56,311 --> 00:51:59,280
<i>for this type</i>
<i>of a tax evasion</i>
<i>was something of a record.</i>

1053
00:51:59,281 --> 00:52:02,883
<i>What fucked him up was</i>
<i>he was stealing cash.</i>

1054
00:52:02,884 --> 00:52:04,918
<i>And he did the dumbest</i>
<i>thing of all.</i>

1055
00:52:04,919 --> 00:52:07,255
If any of you ever do cash
or have your own company,

1056
00:52:07,256 --> 00:52:09,590
you don't do it
in front of employees,

1057
00:52:09,591 --> 00:52:13,410
<i>'cause the guy who's working</i>
<i>for you or the gal who's</i>
<i>working for you,</i>

1058
00:52:13,411 --> 00:52:17,414
<i>you're gonna fire them</i>
<i>or yell at them and they're</i>
<i>gonna bring you down.</i>

1059
00:52:17,415 --> 00:52:19,583
A lot of cash--

1060
00:52:19,584 --> 00:52:21,818
just like Studio 54!

1061
00:52:21,819 --> 00:52:23,854
I don't believe
he was stealing money,

1062
00:52:23,855 --> 00:52:27,191
I don't believe that he was
creating books that--

1063
00:52:27,192 --> 00:52:29,193
didn't exist.
I mean--

1064
00:52:29,194 --> 00:52:34,064
Double books?
Larry was being
King of Swing.

1065
00:52:34,065 --> 00:52:36,233
The demeanor at
the defense table changed.

1066
00:52:36,234 --> 00:52:39,670
All of a sudden there was
silence upon the announcement
of the verdict.

1067
00:52:39,671 --> 00:52:43,441
There was no more affable,
class-clown Larry Levenson.

1068
00:52:43,442 --> 00:52:45,375
It was total silence.

1069
00:52:47,379 --> 00:52:50,998
<i>If you break the law, there's</i>
</i>

1070
00:52:50,999 --> 00:52:54,935
"If ya can't affords the time,
ya don't commits the crime."

1071
00:52:57,439 --> 00:52:58,805
True.

1072
00:53:00,241 --> 00:53:03,143
<i># happiness, happiness #</i>

1073
00:53:03,144 --> 00:53:06,162

1075
00:53:09,282 --> 00:53:11,900
Some of you may have been
wondering whatever happened
to Larry Levenson?

1076
00:53:11,901 --> 00:53:14,670
He's here in Allenwood,
which is a federal
penitentiary.

1077
00:53:14,671 --> 00:53:16,706
It's considered
a level-one prison.

1078
00:53:16,707 --> 00:53:20,125
In the trunk we'd have
clothes, suitcases,

1079
00:53:20,126 --> 00:53:22,161
golf clubs,
a tennis racket.

1080
00:53:22,162 --> 00:53:24,764
We thought it was a place
where you basically just--

1081
00:53:24,765 --> 00:53:26,799
you hung out
but you couldn't leave.

1082
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,818
The lack of sex--
very rarely discussed
or anything.

1083
00:53:29,819 --> 00:53:33,088
Everybody takes care of
that situation by themselves,
you know?

1084
00:53:33,089 --> 00:53:35,124
We were in constant
communication.

1085
00:53:35,125 --> 00:53:37,794
- And he never complained
about it, right?
- Right.

1086
00:53:37,795 --> 00:53:40,463

1089
00:53:44,268 --> 00:53:46,569
You got into an awful mess.

1090

1091
00:53:49,306 --> 00:53:51,924
<i>Plato's without Larry was</i>
<i>like Easter</i>

1092
00:53:51,925 --> 00:53:53,993
at the Vatican
without the Pope.

1093
00:53:53,994 --> 00:53:57,963
The Pope had this tracheotomy
and the Christians are
running amok.

1094
00:54:07,574 --> 00:54:10,076
<i>Without Larry,</i>

Plato's anymore.
It wasn't--

1096
00:54:12,112 --> 00:54:13,946
it wasn't even
wholesome anymore.

1097
00:54:13,947 --> 00:54:16,983
You know?
Because without that
benevolent heart behind it,

1098
00:54:16,984 --> 00:54:20,086
it was just
a tacky swingers club,
you know?

1099
00:54:21,688 --> 00:54:24,941
<i>It required a lot more people</i>
<i>to fill the place.</i>

1100
00:54:24,942 --> 00:54:28,745
So they had special parties--
sometimes they would have
kinky nights.

1101
00:54:28,746 --> 00:54:31,797
I, uh, use the...
Uh, the Pussy Propulsion

Do they have to be in costume?

1105
00:54:41,091 --> 00:54:43,359
Not necessarily,
but it would be fun.

1106
00:54:46,146 --> 00:54:49,731
I'm here every Tuesday

Sounds good to me.

1111
00:55:01,194 --> 00:55:03,813

I give women pony rides.

<i>Except to the music.</i>

1115
00:55:11,404 --> 00:55:14,523
And if you've ever watched

it's very erotic.

1120

to the telephone.

1177
00:58:25,048 --> 00:58:29,051
<i>faces of old friends</i>
<i>and soon-to-be new friends.</i>

1178
00:58:31,788 --> 00:58:35,274
<i>To you members that</i>
<i>frequent Plato's,</i>

1179
00:58:35,275 --> 00:58:39,561
<i>our club is much more</i>
<i>than a sexual haven.</i>

1180
00:58:39,562 --> 00:58:42,147
<i>We are the closest thing</i>
<i>to a family here.</i>

1181
00:58:50,857 --> 00:58:54,259
I'm gonna come back
and I'm gonna make this club
better than ever,

1182
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:57,513
and we're gonna have more fun
than ever and it's just
gonna be beautiful.

1183
00:58:57,514 --> 00:58:59,982
Larry, we welcome you back
and congratulations

1184
00:58:59,983 --> 00:59:02,034
on completing the 32-month
Allenwood diet.

1185
00:59:02,035 --> 00:59:06,038
Everything hits a peak,
so there was a peak
for sexuality.

1186
00:59:06,039 --> 00:59:07,907
There was a peak
for disco.

1187
00:59:07,908 --> 00:59:11,777
# karma karma karma karma
karma chameleon... #

1188
00:59:11,778 --> 00:59:15,648
The club was in a decline
and so was Larry.

1189
00:59:15,649 --> 00:59:17,750
Were we distressed about it?

1190
00:59:17,751 --> 00:59:19,118
Yes.

1191
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:21,920
Come down and fulfill your
most fantastic fantasies

1192
00:59:21,921 --> 00:59:24,624
and stimulate
your wildest dreams.

1193
00:59:24,625 --> 00:59:26,692
<i># oh yes,</i>
<i>it's ladies' night #</i>

1194
00:59:26,693 --> 00:59:28,927
<i># and the feeling's</i>
<i>right... #</i>

1195
00:59:28,928 --> 00:59:32,047
<i>Is it going to be ladies' night</i>
<i>every Monday, do you know?</i>

1196
00:59:32,048 --> 00:59:35,318
Ladies' night, 6:00-9:00;
then 9:00 the men come in.

1197
00:59:35,319 --> 00:59:37,886
<i>They would have at Plato's</i>
<i>singles nights</i>

1198
00:59:37,887 --> 00:59:41,123
<i>to kind of introduce people</i>
<i>who never swung before.</i>

1199
00:59:41,124 --> 00:59:42,625
<i># oh yes,</i>
<i>it's ladies' night #</i>

1200
00:59:42,626 --> 00:59:44,543
<i># oh, what a night,</i>
<i>oh, what a night... #</i>

1201
00:59:44,544 --> 00:59:46,361
<i>There'd be stripper</i>
<i>after stripper</i>

1202
00:59:46,362 --> 00:59:48,213
<i>and the women are getting</i>
<i>wilder and wilder.</i>

1203
00:59:48,214 --> 00:59:51,450
Then 9:00, or a couple
of hours later,

1204
00:59:51,451 --> 00:59:53,753
the men-- the single men
would be allowed in.

1205
00:59:53,754 --> 00:59:56,422
And these guys were
horny fucks.

1206
00:59:56,423 --> 00:59:59,541
Then what they'd do though,
they'd have to have
a lot more girls

1207
00:59:59,542 --> 01:00:01,577
that would be like girls
that would be hired.

1208
01:00:05,782 --> 01:00:08,017
<i>But you couldn't</i>
<i>necessarily separate</i>

1209
01:00:08,018 --> 01:00:09,918
<i>the prostitutes</i>
<i>from the wives</i>

1210
01:00:09,919 --> 01:00:12,170
because the wives were
kind of doing themselves up

1211
01:00:12,171 --> 01:00:13,639
like prostitutes often.

1212
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:15,590
There was coke everywhere.

1213
01:00:15,591 --> 01:00:18,327
And everybody used it
to stay awake,

1214
01:00:18,328 --> 01:00:20,780
<i>to keep going, for this,</i>
<i>that and the other thing,</i>

1215
01:00:20,781 --> 01:00:21,947
<i>to feel better.</i>

1216
01:00:21,948 --> 01:00:24,750
Stay up, keep going,

1217
01:00:24,751 --> 01:00:26,685
Don't stop.

1218
01:00:26,686 --> 01:00:28,721
I'm gonna have fun.

1219
01:00:31,191 --> 01:00:34,960
<i>Prostitution was the tail</i>
<i>that wagged the dog.</i>

1220
01:00:34,961 --> 01:00:38,497
<i>Because I believe</i>
<i>40%-50% of the girls there</i>

1221
01:00:38,498 --> 01:00:41,733
every night,
with their, quote, date,

1222
01:00:41,734 --> 01:00:44,636
were hookers.
And I know that to be a fact

1223
01:00:44,637 --> 01:00:46,805
because the hookers
advertised in "screw."

1224
01:00:46,806 --> 01:00:50,008
<i>I remember I met</i>
<i>an African-American woman</i>

1225
01:00:50,009 --> 01:00:52,728
and we went into the back
and we went into one
of the rooms

1226
01:00:52,729 --> 01:00:55,731
and the next thing she stuck
her hand out and she wanted
money from me.

1227
01:00:55,732 --> 01:00:58,000
And I just didn't
have it, you know?

1228
01:00:58,001 --> 01:01:01,237
She said, "Well, I'm sorry."

1229
01:01:01,238 --> 01:01:04,323
There was just this--
a sense of impending doom.

1230
01:01:04,324 --> 01:01:06,826
But I don't know how much
we talked about it.

1231
01:01:06,827 --> 01:01:09,061
It lost the warmth.

1232
01:01:09,062 --> 01:01:11,097
And that wasn't, I think,
just the steam

1233
01:01:11,098 --> 01:01:13,865
rising off of all that water
they had going in there.

1234
01:01:13,866 --> 01:01:17,436
It was moving towards
that point in the '80s

1235
01:01:17,437 --> 01:01:20,439
when sex was terrifying.

1236
01:01:32,752 --> 01:01:36,522
<i># I've just closed</i>
<i>my eyes again... #</i>

1237
01:01:36,523 --> 01:01:39,492
<i>AIDS reduces the number</i>
<i>of helper cells in the blood.</i>

1238
01:01:39,493 --> 01:01:42,861
<i>Therefore the body has no way</i>
<i>of either detecting</i>

1239
01:01:42,862 --> 01:01:46,015
<i>or attacking</i>
<i>certain infections.</i>

1240
01:01:46,016 --> 01:01:51,470
<i># driver, take away</i>
<i>my worries of today... #</i>

1241
01:01:52,839 --> 01:01:56,708
When AIDS first hit,
nobody even knew
what it was yet.

1242
01:01:56,709 --> 01:01:59,145
No one quite knew how
it was transmitted.

1243
01:01:59,146 --> 01:02:02,515
- No one knew how
to have safe sex.
- <i># dream Weaver #</i>

1244
01:02:02,516 --> 01:02:07,535
<i># I believe you can get me</i>
<i>through the night... #</i>

1245
01:02:07,536 --> 01:02:11,006
The people who cared
about their lives stopped
going to sex clubs.

1246
01:02:11,007 --> 01:02:14,693
And so you got a more
hardcore, self-destructive

1247
01:02:14,694 --> 01:02:18,613
- <i>group of people.</i>
- <i># Dream Weaver. #</i>

1248
01:02:22,936 --> 01:02:25,904
All this talk about AIDS,
aren't you worried about it?

1249
01:02:25,905 --> 01:02:27,906
Being with so many
different men?

1250
01:02:27,907 --> 01:02:31,260
Larry, I've never
heard of a woman that
has contacted AIDS

1251
01:02:31,261 --> 01:02:34,029
through sexual intercourse.

1252
01:02:34,030 --> 01:02:37,499
I went from one extreme
to the other,

1253
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:41,136
saying "this is not something
you get a shot for,

1254
01:02:41,137 --> 01:02:44,539
<i>or take a pill for.</i>
<i>This is your life.</i>

1255
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:49,294
- And you need to rethink
your priorities in life."
- <i></i>

1256
01:02:50,830 --> 01:02:53,599
And I say god was kind
and I was spared.

1257
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:56,202
Some other people
were not that lucky.

1258
01:02:56,203 --> 01:03:00,990
That 73% of the AIDS cases
are in homosexuals,

1259
01:03:00,991 --> 01:03:03,325
this is put out
by the State of New York,
Dr. Axelrod.

1260
01:03:03,326 --> 01:03:06,061
Wait, let me--
let me finish.

1261
01:03:06,062 --> 01:03:07,963
Sir-- sir, let me finish.

1262
01:03:07,964 --> 01:03:12,451
<i>It was like a ghost town.</i>
<i>For about 30 days,</i>

1263
01:03:12,452 --> 01:03:14,186
<i>it was like nobody.</i>

1264
01:03:14,187 --> 01:03:16,605
Everybody was just scared.
They didn't even know

1265
01:03:16,606 --> 01:03:18,407
if you could get it
mouth to mouth.

1266
01:03:18,408 --> 01:03:20,726
<i>The St. Marks Bathhouse</i>
<i>was shut down</i>

1267
01:03:20,727 --> 01:03:24,012
<i>after undercover inspectors</i>
<i>reported that they had observed</i>

1268
01:03:24,013 --> 01:03:27,132
<i>49 acts of high-risk</i>
<i>sexual activity</i>

1269
01:03:27,133 --> 01:03:30,035
<i>involving</i>
<i>more than 80 people.</i>

1270
01:03:30,036 --> 01:03:33,188
<i>Only medical science</i>

1271
01:03:33,189 --> 01:03:35,574
can ever truly defeat AIDS.

1272
01:03:35,575 --> 01:03:38,894
I think that Koch,
who I admired,

1273
01:03:38,895 --> 01:03:41,831
<i>wanted to bust down</i>
<i>on the gay clubs.</i>

1274
01:03:41,832 --> 01:03:45,317
To make things even,
he busted down on Plato's.

1275
01:03:47,487 --> 01:03:50,722
<i>They said that AIDS did</i>
<i>go through Plato's Retreat.</i>

1276
01:03:50,723 --> 01:03:53,159
No, they came down
and interviewed me.

1277
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:54,927
And that's all they did.

1278
01:03:54,928 --> 01:03:58,597
And we found out since
that with the smell of chlorine

1279
01:03:58,598 --> 01:04:00,766
in the air at Plato's Retreat,

1280
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:03,435
the AIDS virus does not
have a chance.

1281
01:04:03,436 --> 01:04:05,404
It just happens to be
a factual thing.

1282
01:04:05,405 --> 01:04:08,106
<i>One of the key parts</i>
<i>of the effort would be</i>

1283
01:04:08,107 --> 01:04:10,642
<i>to collect evidence,</i>
<i>which if it was necessary,</i>

1284
01:04:10,643 --> 01:04:13,345
if it became necessary
to seek to close a place down,

1285
01:04:13,346 --> 01:04:15,865
this is the kind of evidence
that would hold up in court.

1286
01:04:15,866 --> 01:04:18,416
Larry had signs posted.

1287
01:04:18,417 --> 01:04:21,903
<i>And he has his security that</i>
<i>are walking around actually</i>
<i>telling people,</i>

1288
01:04:21,904 --> 01:04:24,839
"Wait till this little
thing is over with.
But right now,

1289
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:27,576
we can't allow anal sex,
we can't allow oral sex
on a guy."

1290
01:04:27,577 --> 01:04:31,279
The law prohibits anal sex
and fellatio.

1291
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:34,516
- <i>Excuse me?</i>
- You can have
sexual intercourse

1292
01:04:34,517 --> 01:04:36,351
legally
on Plato's premises.

1293
01:04:37,854 --> 01:04:39,087
Hello?

1294
01:04:39,088 --> 01:04:42,090
Some of the inspectors
were so...

1295
01:04:42,091 --> 01:04:45,627
uh, overwhelmed--

1296
01:04:45,628 --> 01:04:48,514
<i>distressed</i>
<i>by what they saw</i>

1297
01:04:48,515 --> 01:04:51,767
that they needed
actually counseling

1298
01:04:51,768 --> 01:04:53,802
and counseling
was provided.

1299
01:04:53,803 --> 01:04:56,104
"Government of the people,
for the people

1300
01:04:56,105 --> 01:04:58,640
and by the people should
not perish from this earth."

1301
01:04:58,641 --> 01:05:01,176
Now Mr. Koch is trying
to tell me that the people

1302
01:05:01,177 --> 01:05:03,378
have nothing to do
with government.

1303
01:05:03,379 --> 01:05:06,515
It's like a war.
You're fighting the city.

1304
01:05:12,855 --> 01:05:15,224
<i>I want to talk to</i>
<i>the fat guy on the right.</i>

1305
01:05:15,225 --> 01:05:17,576
There are two fat guys here.
Which one?

1306
01:05:17,577 --> 01:05:19,711
On the right?
Go ahead, fat guy.

1307
01:05:19,712 --> 01:05:22,313
- What do you have to say?
- <i>Do you suck?</i>

1308
01:05:22,314 --> 01:05:23,849
Oh, you're a moron.

1309
01:05:23,850 --> 01:05:26,418
Good evening.
Plato's Retreat is
the latest casualty

1310
01:05:26,419 --> 01:05:28,821
in New York's war
on dangerous sex.

1311
01:05:35,127 --> 01:05:37,629
<i>Inspectors would come in</i>
<i>and they described what to us</i>

1312
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:40,232
<i>seemed like prostitution</i>
<i>activities.</i>

1313
01:05:40,233 --> 01:05:43,335
<i>In its prime, thousands</i>
<i>of heterosexual couples</i>

1314
01:05:43,336 --> 01:05:45,337
<i>flocked to Plato's Retreat.</i>

1315
01:05:45,338 --> 01:05:48,340
<i>But the party came to a halt</i>
<i>at the well-known nightclub.</i>

1316
01:05:48,341 --> 01:05:50,793
<i>Minutes before its</i>
<i>scheduled opening,</i>

1317
01:05:50,794 --> 01:05:54,312
<i>city officials closed the venue</i>
<i>on charges of prostitution.</i>

1318
01:05:54,313 --> 01:05:56,715
The city knows as
everybody else knows

1319
01:05:56,716 --> 01:05:59,084
we never allowed prostitution
on our premises,

1320
01:05:59,085 --> 01:06:00,986
and I always say
that we never will.

1321
01:06:00,987 --> 01:06:02,537
<i>So we went in there</i>

1322
01:06:02,538 --> 01:06:04,840
<i>and the judge signed</i>
<i>the preliminary injunction.</i>

1323
01:06:04,841 --> 01:06:07,176
<i>It went to an appellate court</i>
<i>and the appellate court</i>

1324
01:06:07,177 --> 01:06:09,244
<i>changed the temporary</i>
<i>closing order.</i>

1325
01:06:11,247 --> 01:06:13,515
- Hello, you're on the air.
- <i>Yeah, hi.</i>

1326
01:06:13,516 --> 01:06:16,584
<i>Um, can you tell me what</i>
<i>the status of the club</i>
<i>is right now?</i>

1327
01:06:16,585 --> 01:06:21,123
<i>And, um... is it still closed</i>
<i>or what are they doing</i>
<i>at this point?</i>

1328
01:06:21,124 --> 01:06:23,425
- At Plato's, you mean, sir?
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

1329
01:06:23,426 --> 01:06:25,360
Plato's Retreat is now open.

1330
01:06:26,962 --> 01:06:29,965
The place is reopened
and we send inspectors
in there again.

1331
01:06:29,966 --> 01:06:32,968
And within
a short period of time,
the inspectors are coming back

1332
01:06:32,969 --> 01:06:35,403
and they're saying,
"forget about prostitution now.

1333
01:06:35,404 --> 01:06:37,372
We're seeing high-risk
sexual activities."

1334
01:06:37,373 --> 01:06:40,742
Starting tonight
for the next year,

1335
01:06:40,743 --> 01:06:44,112
all profits made
by Plato's Retreat,

1336
01:06:44,113 --> 01:06:47,849
will be donated
to AIDS research.

1337
01:06:47,850 --> 01:06:50,602
Two weeks later,
New Year's Eve, boof!

1338
01:06:50,603 --> 01:06:52,237
We get closed for good.

1339
01:06:52,238 --> 01:06:54,640
Tonight the city closed
Plato's Retreat, that notorious

1340
01:06:54,641 --> 01:06:56,942
heterosexual sex club
on Manhattan's West Side.

1341
01:06:59,179 --> 01:07:01,146
<i>Plato's Retreat is</i>
<i>more than just a club.</i>

1342
01:07:01,147 --> 01:07:03,882
It's an institution.
It's a monument to
sexual freedom.

1343
01:07:03,883 --> 01:07:05,651
And they set us back
50 years.

1344
01:07:05,652 --> 01:07:08,386
Plato's was then closed
on December 31st.

1345
01:07:08,387 --> 01:07:11,389
And actually, it never
reopened after that.

1346
01:07:15,845 --> 01:07:19,932
I remember driving up at 7:30
and seeing the door padlocked

1347
01:07:19,933 --> 01:07:22,100
with the police tape
on it.

1348
01:07:22,101 --> 01:07:23,435
And...

1349
01:07:23,436 --> 01:07:26,037
there was no notice,
no nothing.

1350
01:07:26,038 --> 01:07:29,207
They didn't tell anyone
that we're going to be
closing you down.

1351
01:07:29,208 --> 01:07:30,876
They just came
on New Year's Eve.

1352
01:07:30,877 --> 01:07:32,444
I think it was
to spank them.

1353
01:07:32,445 --> 01:07:34,863
Larry's really really upset.
He's almost holding back tears.

1354
01:07:34,864 --> 01:07:37,532
You could see it.
Because now he knows that
the city just crippled him

1355
01:07:37,533 --> 01:07:40,168
and he's looking at the future.
He goes, "I can't
stay open, Ron.

1356
01:07:40,169 --> 01:07:42,904
The money I made
from New Year's Eve was going
to keep me going with rent."

1357
01:07:42,905 --> 01:07:45,257
Rise and Fall
of the Roman Empire.

1358
01:07:45,258 --> 01:07:48,126
Everything fell apart:
All the connections,

1359
01:07:48,127 --> 01:07:50,428
the phone calls--
everything stopped.

1360
01:07:50,429 --> 01:07:53,498
We have no
meeting ground anymore.

1361
01:07:53,499 --> 01:07:56,401
We have no home
for the family anymore.

1362
01:07:56,402 --> 01:07:59,204
So everybody takes off
to different areas.

1363
01:07:59,205 --> 01:08:01,874
Everybody goes back
to real life.

1364
01:08:01,875 --> 01:08:04,810
From what I could see,
most clubs in Manhattan

1365
01:08:04,811 --> 01:08:07,412
lasted a few years.
They'd be really hot,

1366
01:08:07,413 --> 01:08:10,882
maybe six, eight, 10 years
and then they'd close down.

1367
01:08:10,883 --> 01:08:12,951
And people were on
to the new club.

1368
01:08:15,521 --> 01:08:18,957
I think Plato's kind of died
a natural death actually.

1369
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:23,695
It might have had
a little help.

1370
01:08:23,696 --> 01:08:26,348
It was a different era then
with everything that was
going on.

1371
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:31,253
A place like that...
It wasn't going to last anyway.

1372
01:08:31,254 --> 01:08:33,288
A lot of people...

1373
01:08:34,657 --> 01:08:36,975
Just couldn't--
don't like the lifestyle

1374
01:08:36,976 --> 01:08:38,643
so they put it down,

1375
01:08:38,644 --> 01:08:41,362
like our mayors
and our governors.

1376
01:08:41,363 --> 01:08:44,299
But meanwhile
they're the ones in here.

1377
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:46,819
It was like, "We should
all sing 'Old Lang Sone'--"

1378
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:48,486
"Old Lang..."

1379
01:08:48,487 --> 01:08:50,922
- <i>"Syne."</i>
- Whatever.
"--'Old Lang whatever.'"

1380
01:08:50,923 --> 01:08:53,508
After the club closed

1381
01:08:53,509 --> 01:08:56,845
I think that's when it
took him over completely.

1382
01:08:56,846 --> 01:09:00,515
I think that's
when Larry really

1383
01:09:00,516 --> 01:09:03,318
fell into hard times--

1384
01:09:03,319 --> 01:09:05,954
No finances.

1385
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:11,009
Tonight we're talking
with Larry Levenson.

1386
01:09:11,010 --> 01:09:14,046
Larry was the owner
of Plato's Retreat.

1387
01:09:14,047 --> 01:09:18,867
Plato's Retreat was
the largest swing club
in New York.

1388
01:09:18,868 --> 01:09:22,587
<i>He was the original</i>
<i>prototype swinger.</i>

1389
01:09:22,588 --> 01:09:25,423
<i>That was his life.</i>
<i>That was why he started</i>
<i>the club.</i>

1390
01:09:25,424 --> 01:09:28,560
<i>And basically the club ended</i>
<i>because of that narcissism.</i>

1391
01:09:28,561 --> 01:09:31,413
You start believing it and you
think you can do no wrong

1392
01:09:31,414 --> 01:09:33,415
and you're gonna
beat the system.

1393
01:09:33,416 --> 01:09:36,602
Larry was depressed.
And I'd visit him in his
apartment in Brooklyn

1394
01:09:36,603 --> 01:09:38,437
and he'd be doing
crack cocaine.

1395
01:09:38,438 --> 01:09:41,139
And he's sweating--
"Larry, you're sweating
like a pig.

1396
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:43,208
It doesn't look like
you're having fun."

1397
01:09:43,209 --> 01:09:46,361
He goes, "trust me.
It's a nice feeling and it
takes away the pain."

1398
01:09:46,362 --> 01:09:49,148
He went to parents
without partners and he
was enjoying that

1399
01:09:49,149 --> 01:09:51,016
and meeting lots
of different people.

1400
01:09:51,017 --> 01:09:53,652
And he did meet
Marilyn there.

1401
01:09:53,653 --> 01:09:55,821
- I just got engaged
last week.
- Mazel tov.

1402
01:09:55,822 --> 01:09:57,789
- A beautiful young lady, yeah.
- Mazel tov.

1403
01:09:57,790 --> 01:10:00,325
- Yeah, I'm very happy.
- And she's sweet woman.

1404
01:10:00,326 --> 01:10:02,627
She is wonderful.
And the whole point is

1405
01:10:02,628 --> 01:10:04,162
<i>what do I want to do</i>
<i>with my life?</i>

1406
01:10:10,402 --> 01:10:12,737
Don't know how long
it was good.

1407
01:10:12,738 --> 01:10:17,542
I do remember one incident where
he asked me to go to the house

1408
01:10:17,543 --> 01:10:19,210
and pick up a check.

1409
01:10:19,211 --> 01:10:21,646
He got divorced again,
so now...

1410
01:10:21,647 --> 01:10:24,849
now he's back to being single
and he's back in Brooklyn again.

1411
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:27,002
Remember he was
driving a cab?

1412
01:10:27,003 --> 01:10:29,471
He was driving a cab,
I remember that.

1413
01:10:29,472 --> 01:10:33,858
<i># I still get</i>
<i>that same old feeling #</i>

1414
01:10:33,859 --> 01:10:36,628
<i># tearing at</i>
<i>this heart of mine... #</i>

1415
01:10:36,629 --> 01:10:38,697
<i>I hailed a yellow cab.</i>
<i>I got in.</i>

1416
01:10:38,698 --> 01:10:42,835
and sometimes I have a habit
of looking at the hack license.

1417
01:10:42,836 --> 01:10:45,871
When my dad had the club,
he had all the friends.

1418
01:10:45,872 --> 01:10:48,239
Everybody wanted
to hang out with him.

1419
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:51,076
Then when he didn't have
the club, they were gone.

1420
01:10:51,077 --> 01:10:53,295
I saw the name Larry Levenson.

1421
01:10:53,296 --> 01:10:56,498
And I kept saying,
"Larry Levenson, Larry Levenson?

1422
01:10:56,499 --> 01:10:58,833
That's the man
who owned Plato's."

1423
01:10:58,834 --> 01:11:02,203
You have to pick and choose
who your friends are.

1424
01:11:02,204 --> 01:11:06,608
And you have to stay grounded.
I think my dad was
never grounded.

1425
01:11:10,864 --> 01:11:15,100
<i>I thought that we were</i>
<i>a great family.</i>

1426
01:11:15,101 --> 01:11:18,003
<i>And I really believed,</i>
<i>truly,</i>

1427
01:11:18,004 --> 01:11:20,605
<i>that we were a community.</i>

1428
01:11:20,606 --> 01:11:23,842
<i>But I guess</i>
<i>I was mistaken.</i>

1429
01:11:23,843 --> 01:11:26,845
<i>It was me...</i>
<i></i>

1430
01:11:26,846 --> 01:11:28,780
<i>that felt that.</i>

1431
01:11:28,781 --> 01:11:31,216
<i>I was the king.</i>

1432
01:11:32,485 --> 01:11:35,837
One day he invited us
to Brooklyn to see his house.

1433
01:11:35,838 --> 01:11:38,590
<i>And he lived down</i>
<i>in the basement because...</i>

1434
01:11:38,591 --> 01:11:41,225
<i>The brick building,</i>
<i>he rented upstairs--</i>

1435
01:11:41,226 --> 01:11:43,328
I guess the two floors.

1436
01:11:43,329 --> 01:11:47,165
And I was shocked the way
he lives down in the basement
with cats and everything.

1437
01:11:47,166 --> 01:11:51,002
It both-- my mind--
how could he live
in a basement?

1438
01:11:51,003 --> 01:11:54,406
Then he took us out
for a nice lobster dinner.

1439
01:11:54,407 --> 01:11:56,641
He had just gone
through heart surgery.

1440
01:11:56,642 --> 01:12:00,078
He was in the hospital.
We were living down here.

1441
01:12:00,079 --> 01:12:03,848
He had had a heart attack.
He was in the intensive
care unit.

1442
01:12:03,849 --> 01:12:06,717
I brought some flowers
for his nurses.

1443
01:12:06,718 --> 01:12:09,387
He seemed in good spirits.

1444
01:12:09,388 --> 01:12:11,706
When I heard that
Larry Levenson

1445
01:12:11,707 --> 01:12:15,877
died from a heart attack
and that he'd become
a cab driver

1446
01:12:15,878 --> 01:12:19,347
I just thought, "wow,
that was just so hard
to reconcile

1447
01:12:19,348 --> 01:12:22,550
that the king
of Plato's Retreat

1448
01:12:22,551 --> 01:12:26,387
Could end up like
a broken-down old hack."

1449
01:12:26,388 --> 01:12:28,990
I just remember getting a phone
call that Larry's passed away.

1450
01:12:28,991 --> 01:12:32,477
I was pretty miserable
for quite a while. It was one
of the ones that really hurt.

1451
01:12:51,630 --> 01:12:54,582
When Larry started Plato's,

1452
01:12:54,583 --> 01:12:57,052
We were still
in that period where

1453
01:12:57,053 --> 01:12:59,921
sex wasn't just sex
and pleasure,

1454
01:12:59,922 --> 01:13:02,490
it was also about
kind of revolution,

1455
01:13:02,491 --> 01:13:04,492
a breaking with the past.

1456
01:13:04,493 --> 01:13:08,463
I think the only difference
between Larry and many men
in our society

1457
01:13:08,464 --> 01:13:11,899
and culture is that Larry didn't
hesitate to talk about it

1458
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:14,469
and tell the truth about it,
how he actually felt.

1459
01:13:14,470 --> 01:13:17,539
I wonder how many men

1460
01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:21,576
hide how they really
feel about sex.

1461
01:13:21,577 --> 01:13:24,679
Or how many men would have
the courage to say

1462
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:27,315
"I want to do them all"?

1463
01:13:27,316 --> 01:13:30,318
Every time I drive by the club,
even to this day,

1464
01:13:30,319 --> 01:13:32,220
I still feel the magic.

1465
01:13:36,058 --> 01:13:38,276
<i>Look at it, the lights</i>
<i>are still here.</i>

1466
01:13:38,277 --> 01:13:40,445
Oh, there's disco lights
over there.

1467
01:13:40,446 --> 01:13:42,380
The sprinkler system
was here.

1468
01:13:44,267 --> 01:13:47,769
There's our fan,
still up there to this day.

1469
01:13:47,770 --> 01:13:50,338
<i>Whatever Frankie built,</i>
<i>it's still there.</i>

1470
01:13:50,339 --> 01:13:54,208
So... amazing.

1471
01:13:54,209 --> 01:13:56,310
<i>One thing about</i>
<i>getting older</i>

1472
01:13:56,311 --> 01:13:58,245
<i>is that you don't want</i>
<i>to look back and say</i>

1473
01:13:58,246 --> 01:14:00,982
<i>"Wow, really I'm sorry</i>
<i>I didn't do that.</i>

1474
01:14:00,983 --> 01:14:03,001
I really am sorry
I missed that.

1475
01:14:03,002 --> 01:14:05,437
I really am sorry I didn't
take advantage of that."

1476
01:14:05,438 --> 01:14:08,440
I'm an old lady
with no regrets,

1477
01:14:08,441 --> 01:14:09,741
because I'll tell you:

1478
01:14:09,742 --> 01:14:12,544
Those-- that period was
very special.

1479
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:18,032
It was the same
routine every night
but different bodies.

1480
01:14:18,033 --> 01:14:19,668
Different sizes.

1481
01:14:21,771 --> 01:14:23,838
Tall, short--

1482
01:14:25,107 --> 01:14:27,108
It was, you know,
a sight to see...

1483
01:14:27,109 --> 01:14:29,211
Every night.

1484
01:14:29,212 --> 01:14:31,830
<i>Somehow</i>
<i>whenever anybody</i>

1485
01:14:31,831 --> 01:14:35,233
discusses Plato's Retreat,
they do it with a smile
on their face.

1486
01:14:35,234 --> 01:14:37,168
If anybody was there,
they're happy.

1487
01:14:37,169 --> 01:14:39,938
If anybody wasn't there,
they're only sorry

1488
01:14:39,939 --> 01:14:43,641
that they didn't get
an opportunity to go there
and see it.

1489
01:14:45,177 --> 01:14:47,779
<i>It was very exciting</i>
<i>to a lot of people.</i>

1490
01:14:47,780 --> 01:14:50,281
And when we finally
caught up with it,

1491
01:14:50,282 --> 01:14:52,883
we were amused by it
as well.

1492
01:14:55,671 --> 01:14:57,872
I'm-- I'm really glad I went.

1493
01:14:57,873 --> 01:15:00,608
I'm glad to have the experience
of having gone.

1494
01:15:00,609 --> 01:15:03,478
Just as I'm glad
that I got to the top

1495
01:15:03,479 --> 01:15:05,714
of the World Trade Center
once.

1496
01:15:08,718 --> 01:15:11,970
Even to today people say
things to me:

1497
01:15:11,971 --> 01:15:14,956
"I knew your father.
I remember your father."

1498
01:15:17,309 --> 01:15:20,395
Okay, some people,
they have no memories.

1499
01:15:20,396 --> 01:15:22,263
They had a boring normal...

1500
01:15:22,264 --> 01:15:25,900
Let's say everyday-straight
kind of life.

1501
01:15:25,901 --> 01:15:29,604
I've led
a different kind of life.
I've had that life

1502
01:15:29,605 --> 01:15:31,272
and my life changed...

1503
01:15:32,858 --> 01:15:35,293
<i>By going to Plato's...</i>

1504
01:15:37,062 --> 01:15:39,331
by getting into open sex.

1505
01:15:39,332 --> 01:15:42,601
These are things that you
never thought you would
ever do in life.

1506
01:15:42,602 --> 01:15:44,503
You didn't even
think about it.

1507
01:15:44,504 --> 01:15:47,372
So a lot of people,
they don't have those memories.

1508
01:15:47,373 --> 01:15:51,443
I have those memories.
I can see the faces
in front of me now.

1509
01:16:29,782 --> 01:16:32,416
<i>It was good for me.</i>

1510
01:16:32,417 --> 01:16:34,452
it was good for me.

1511
01:16:34,453 --> 01:16:37,421
It was great for me.

1512
01:16:37,422 --> 01:16:39,240
Is Larry still around,
by the way?

1513
01:16:39,241 --> 01:16:43,678
- Are you guys talking to Larry?
- <i>He passed away in '99.</i>

1514
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:45,813
- He passed away?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

1515
01:16:45,814 --> 01:16:48,750
- He was only about 50.
- <i>62.</i>

1516
01:16:49,951 --> 01:16:51,218
Wow.

1517
01:17:03,664 --> 01:17:06,533
<i># oh, how happy #</i>

1518
01:17:06,534 --> 01:17:09,203
<i># you have made me #</i>

1519
01:17:09,204 --> 01:17:11,905
<i># oh, how happy #</i>

1520
01:17:11,906 --> 01:17:14,241
<i># you have made me #</i>

1521
01:17:14,242 --> 01:17:17,111
<i># I have kissed</i>
<i>your lips #</i>

1522
01:17:17,112 --> 01:17:19,780
<i># a thousand times #</i>

1523
01:17:19,781 --> 01:17:22,616
<i># and more times</i>
<i>than I can count #</i>

1524
01:17:22,617 --> 01:17:24,952
<i># I have called you mine #</i>

1525
01:17:24,953 --> 01:17:26,086
<i># you have stood... #</i>

1526
01:17:26,087 --> 01:17:28,188
<i>I tried to hide the fact</i>

1527
01:17:28,189 --> 01:17:30,523
<i>That Larry Levenson</i>
<i>was my brother.</i>

1528
01:17:30,524 --> 01:17:32,559
<i>after all, my name</i>
<i>was Karen Posner.</i>

1529
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:35,395
<i>It wasn't too difficult,</i>
<i>I thought, to keep it a secret.</i>

1530
01:17:35,396 --> 01:17:38,565
<i>But of course everybody knew</i>
<i>because of the car showing up</i>
<i>at the house</i>

1531
01:17:38,566 --> 01:17:42,102
and Larry marching into all
of our backyard barbecues.

1532
01:17:42,103 --> 01:17:44,772
I saw people getting down

1533
01:17:44,773 --> 01:17:48,175
in various stages.
Big deal.

1534
01:17:48,176 --> 01:17:50,860
What did you expect?
Where do you expect babies
come from?

1535
01:17:50,861 --> 01:17:54,097
I wouldn't just take
my clothes off and just
walk around like that.

1536
01:17:54,098 --> 01:17:56,766
You know?
Have I done anything there?

1537
01:17:58,736 --> 01:18:02,289
I really can't talk
about that... if I've ever
done anything there.

1538
01:18:02,290 --> 01:18:05,909
What is the difference
between parsley and pussy?

1539
01:18:05,910 --> 01:18:08,578
He says, "What is
the difference?"
I says,

1540
01:18:08,579 --> 01:18:10,613
"Well, who eats parsley?"

1541
01:18:12,950 --> 01:18:15,184
One of Larry's ideas

1542
01:18:15,185 --> 01:18:18,655
was that he
seriously believed

1543
01:18:18,656 --> 01:18:22,459
that he could have sex
with every single woman

1544
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:25,729
in New York and I was
going to help him do it.

1545
01:18:26,964 --> 01:18:29,333
What do you say
to something like that?

1546
01:18:29,334 --> 01:18:30,800
We laugh.

1547
01:18:30,801 --> 01:18:34,337
That's what
keeps a marriage
going sometimes

1548
01:18:34,338 --> 01:18:36,139
is laughter.

1549
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:38,274
I mean he makes me laugh,
I make him laugh.

1550
01:18:38,275 --> 01:18:41,110
- And now we have a new life.
- Uh uh uh!

1551
01:18:41,111 --> 01:18:42,746
Yeah, but now we got
a new life.

1552
01:18:42,747 --> 01:18:44,714
- But uh uh uh.
- No, home.

1553
01:18:44,715 --> 01:18:46,983
Oh yeah.
Our poker life.

1554
01:18:46,984 --> 01:18:51,588
Now we can't wait
to get back to Vegas
in December.

1555
01:18:53,290 --> 01:18:54,491
Go ahead.
What else?

1556
01:18:54,492 --> 01:18:56,043
<i>#...Made me #</i>

1557
01:18:56,044 --> 01:18:58,545
<i># you have made me #</i>

1558
01:18:58,546 --> 01:19:01,014
<i># you have made me #</i>

1559
01:19:01,015 --> 01:19:03,350
<i># you have made me. #</i>
