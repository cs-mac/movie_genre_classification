1
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:43,554
Very good.

2
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:46,559
Exquisitely worked.

3
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,566
You've crafted a jewel, my boy.

4
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,801
Perfect for a courtesan or priest...

5
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:33,505
to pluck after supper, or polish...

6
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:37,378
...Sundays after mass.

7
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,174
In other words...

8
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,150
...this violin will never bear my name.

9
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,925
Put your anger into your work, my boy.

10
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,987
Stay with me and learn.

11
00:06:58,217 --> 00:06:59,309
Madame?

12
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,648
Cesca, can you still see the future?

13
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,317
Are you all right?

14
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:09,955
Sit down.

15
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,690
Did you call me? I was in the garden.

16
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,628
- I can come here, can't I?
- Of course.

17
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,334
This is part of my house.

18
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:19,803
Of course, madame.

19
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:29,011
I have some new amulets and bones for you.

20
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:34,009
If your husband spits on them it will help.

21
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:36,145
Are you hungry?

22
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:39,381
Don't eat that, it's fish.

23
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:40,559
So?

24
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:46,063
Your child will be slow to learn.

25
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:52,429
I also have some stones for you...

26
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,401
and a key to wear around your neck.

27
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:56,737
My husband's tired of spitting.

28
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:59,242
Spitting's what men are good for.

29
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:03,412
A father's saliva, the best thing he can give.

30
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:08,116
Cesca... Tell me my child's future.

31
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:10,188
I can't do that.

32
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,022
Don't worry about my husband.

33
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:16,389
It's not your husband.

34
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:19,565
I'm simply not able to do it.

35
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:22,527
I see.

36
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:28,136
Until the baby is born your humors are one.

37
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:34,636
However... I can read your future.

38
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:36,806
No, I told you, I'm scared.

39
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:39,744
Come on, madame.

40
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:42,516
Five cards.

41
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:46,814
It's only the future.

42
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:50,089
What if it's bad?

43
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,256
I'll pretend not to see it.

44
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:17,680
Tell me everything.

45
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,198
The Moon.

46
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:36,666
You'll live a long life, full and rich.

47
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:42,313
There's... There's travel ahead.

48
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:48,483
I see... a long journey.

49
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:56,328
Niccolo?

50
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:00,726
Leave us.

51
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:06,705
Close the door.

52
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:11,835
What is it?

53
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:15,745
Why do you come here in your condition?

54
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:18,476
- I know I'll find you here.
- What is it?

55
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:20,711
- I talked to Cesca.
- And...?

56
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:22,353
She read my future.

57
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,286
Cesca! Dear God!

58
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:28,822
And the birth, she said,
will be very difficult, and painful.

59
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:30,555
They always are.

60
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,294
This is no prediction!

61
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:34,260
We're talking about me!

62
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,696
Why do you listen to Cesca?

63
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:37,801
She is our servant.

64
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:42,039
I have an excellent midwife,
an astrologer, a doctor.

65
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,876
They'll all be there. It will be perfect.

66
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:45,909
I know.

67
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,540
How do you know?

68
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,838
I know.

69
00:10:55,054 --> 00:11:01,926
I'm so old to be having a baby.

70
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:27,950
This is a violin.

71
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:34,553
It's different.

72
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,685
I still have to varnish it.

73
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:39,996
But there's something...

74
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:41,623
It's perfect.

75
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:43,758
Everything else here is junk...

76
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,771
worthy of a peddlar, or the trash heap.

77
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,536
But this is my masterpiece.

78
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:54,871
I made it for our son, Anna.

79
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:57,914
Our son will be a musician.

80
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,648
He'll live for music.

81
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:05,081
He'll bring us pride and
beauty to the world, my love.

82
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:10,820
I wanted to surprise you, but you see...

83
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:12,988
I can also make predictions.

84
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,928
It's too big for a baby.

85
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:19,565
He'll grow.

86
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:33,747
My child will come when this moon is full.

87
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:35,478
Come to bed.

88
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:38,922
You're jealous of our relationship.

89
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,616
Me and the moon.

90
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:42,350
No, I'm not jealous.

91
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,063
I know you'll come back.

92
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,796
Master, a boy is asking for you.

93
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:33,128
Tell him to go away.

94
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:36,464
He won't, sir. The doctor sent him.

95
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:38,909
I think you'd better come.

96
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:41,469
Your wife, sir. The doctor...

97
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:42,477
What is it? She's not well.

98
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:45,116
Having the baby.

99
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:48,073
Get out.

100
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:53,173
Get out! Leave me alone, for God's sake!

101
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:59,315
You must clean the violin every day.

102
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,358
Care for it well.

103
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:05,895
This is your violin for as long
as you're with us at the orphanage.

104
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,202
A curse hangs over you, madame.

105
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:28,444
Danger to those who come under your thrall.

106
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:32,641
And there will be many... many.

107
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:37,911
It is a powerful card, the Hanged Man.

108
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:44,660
I see, I see danger... infirmity and disease.

109
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:50,295
I'm sorry, but what kind, I can't say.

110
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:53,536
There are many kinds of sickness.

111
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,620
These roads, Brother Christoph!

112
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,431
You've no idea what I've endured.

113
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,194
And why such haste?

114
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:29,262
What is so urgent that it couldn't
wait until my next visit?

115
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:31,169
We have a boy, sir.

116
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:32,743
You have many boys!

117
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:35,309
This boy is a miracle, you'll see.

118
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:38,514
Vienna swarms with miracles.

119
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:39,707
Not like him.

120
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:43,084
We felt you should see him at once.

121
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:45,279
Does he speak French?

122
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,221
No, sir. Unfortunately.

123
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:50,793
All your students should learn French.

124
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:53,330
It's the language of music.

125
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:56,792
It hones the ear and elevates the mind!

126
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:16,109
Monsieur Poussin... This is Kaspar Weiss.

127
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:22,452
What violin is this?

128
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:25,522
I haven't seen it before.

129
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,296
We've had it for 100 years.

130
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,635
Far too big for him.

131
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:32,469
Look at his hands.

132
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:35,262
He should play on a child's violin.

133
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:38,442
Even Mozart... God rest his soul,

134
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:41,704
played in Versailles on a child's violin.

135
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,041
No shame in that.

136
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:47,677
Wouldn't you like a smaller... instrument?

137
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,343
He seems to manage.

138
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,718
Let him try.

139
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:58,224
Play, my boy. Play.

140
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:33,554
I see.

141
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:40,495
Monsieur Poussin?

142
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,161
We're prepared to offer a small sum...

143
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,802
to help him in his study.

144
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:10,553
They say you're a good boy,

145
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:12,630
well-mannered and clean.

146
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,496
Glad to hear it.

147
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:18,226
But you don't like vegetables. Is that so?

148
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,335
Yes, sir.

149
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,700
What don't you like?

150
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:26,140
Carrots, sir... and beans and cabbage...

151
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:30,938
These monks can't cook.

152
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:35,186
They also write you've a weak heart.

153
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:36,618
Is that so?

154
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,857
You must have a strong heart to play a violin.

155
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:43,592
Believe me.

156
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:46,253
And stronger still to live in Vienna.

157
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:50,523
You shall see, Vienna is an infuriating city...

158
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,536
infuriating, but magnificent.

159
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:54,726
Magnificent... this city!

160
00:28:57,068 --> 00:29:00,231
Antoinette!

161
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:07,468
May I present to you Kaspar Weiss.

162
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:11,339
One of the most gifted children on Earth.

163
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:13,713
But, Georges, we can't.

164
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:17,620
My wife, Antoinette Poussin.

165
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:19,583
Good afternoon, Kaspar.

166
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:22,259
How nice to meet you.

167
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:26,891
Go on in, I'll show you your room in a minute.

168
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:29,899
Georges, please. We can't afford to keep him!

169
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:31,833
We can't afford not to.

170
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:39,572
There's something about
your playing that eludes me.

171
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:41,612
I've decided to analyze it
systematically with a scientific method.

172
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:51,279
First, your bowing and your left hand phrasing.

173
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:54,517
Your detache, ornamentation and your taste.

174
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:58,525
And theory! Theory, too, is important.

175
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:04,033
You need a lot more than inspiration
to play the violin.

176
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:09,998
You need method. You must think. And work.

177
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,472
Won't you eat?

178
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,842
You must eat!

179
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:15,709
Do you want something else?

180
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,371
Try this cheese. I think you'll like it.

181
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,915
It's French!

182
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:23,016
Try some.

183
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:24,554
Taste it.

184
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:31,858
You'll see, a little different from
the monks' crumbly cheese!

185
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:37,399
Go on. Kaspar... if you play well...

186
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:39,631
you'll enjoy the finest fare.

187
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:41,968
We can't afford coal, let alone food!

188
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:43,630
Sell your jewelry! Sell your David!

189
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:44,697
Besides he voted...

190
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:46,471
to behead the king, the monster!

191
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:52,572
My boy play well, and there will be cheese.

192
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:55,919
Violin, cheese.

193
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:58,783
May I go to my room now?

194
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,949
Go ahead. And sleep well.

195
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,790
Madame will assist you in your prayers.

196
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:12,460
Why speak French? He doesn't understand.

197
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,935
So he'll learn!

198
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,701
I want them to know who taught him!

199
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:34,716
Good morning, Poussin.

200
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:37,855
I pride myself on visiting the

201
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:41,193
Taufer Orphanage three times a year...

202
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:43,559
to offer my services as a teacher...

203
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:48,002
as a gesture of support for
those good men of the cloth.

204
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:50,802
This year, they called early.

205
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:53,077
I was sceptical,

206
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,774
but when this child raised his bow...

207
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:58,744
when he played his first note,

208
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:01,410
well, Baron von Spielmann...

209
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,017
I knew my prayers had been answered.

210
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,820
You've unearthed another wunderkind.

211
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:13,560
I've no money for you, Poussin.

212
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,423
I have no concerts to offer you.

213
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,570
It isn't for the money.

214
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,572
I suggest you find another patron.

215
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:25,034
Must I beg?

216
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:27,873
Isn't that what you're doing?

217
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:31,539
Yes... I am.

218
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:34,781
In 3 weeks...

219
00:32:35,653 --> 00:32:39,646
I'm holding a private audition at my salon.

220
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:42,990
Prince Mannsfeld is leaving for Prussia...

221
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:47,794
and seeks a prodigy to accompany him.

222
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,991
He must hear this boy.

223
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:53,294
Three weeks. Can you be ready? Truthfully!

224
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:55,165
I could be ready tomorrow.

225
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,240
Be very certain, Poussin.

226
00:32:57,875 --> 00:32:59,103
If you embarrass me again...

227
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:03,271
I've charmed the crowned heads of France.

228
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,005
Where are those heads now?

229
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:09,042
Rolling in the gutters of the new Republic!

230
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:32,602
The first phrase, the entire section,

231
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,304
must be played staccato.

232
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:36,672
A modern style, well and good,

233
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:38,682
but let's not be crude.

234
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,577
You liked it, didn't you?

235
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:41,716
I'm delighted.

236
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:43,219
You're going to play it again and

237
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:46,085
again and again.

238
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:53,292
See this? It's a clockwork chronometer,
of my invention.

239
00:33:56,334 --> 00:34:00,964
It's called the Poussin-meter.

240
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:05,271
You will heed it with the same

241
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:08,842
deference you would me.

242
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:12,109
What you just played corresponds to

243
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:15,208
a tempo like this.

244
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:26,654
Each day, as we progress
we shall push down this little ball one notch.

245
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:29,131
Until finally, in 3 weeks,

246
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:31,226
you'll be playing like this.

247
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:37,103
The world will be yours.

248
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:42,702
You see, Antoinette,
there's something I still don't understand.

249
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:46,779
His violin has a wonderful sound,

250
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:48,149
and a lovely form.

251
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:50,278
Of course, it's Italian.

252
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:52,316
Is it very valuable?

253
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,616
Why do you ask?

254
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:58,352
Well, it could pay the rent, if ever...

255
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:02,221
He will play divinely, my dear.

256
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,800
Can't you trust me?

257
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:06,996
Yes, of course I can.

258
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:08,263
But must he sleep with it?

259
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:10,569
He could roll over on it.

260
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:12,099
What?

261
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,107
He sleeps with it?

262
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,410
Straight, proud. Lift your chin. There.

263
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:20,980
Perfect, your bow. You're clutching.

264
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:23,612
Your body's stiff, your elbow's locked.

265
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:26,915
I knew something was holding you back.

266
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:29,652
Something, but I didn't know what.

267
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:31,422
Now it's totally clear.

268
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:34,324
You're oppressed by your violin.

269
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:35,724
It has you completely

270
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:40,100
enslaved. Look at you. There, very good.

271
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,404
If you want to advance, Kaspar Weiss,

272
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:46,309
you must let go.

273
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:50,312
What do you mean, sir? I don't understand.

274
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:55,742
Antoinette tells me you sleep with your violin.

275
00:35:57,121 --> 00:36:00,022
Tonight you'll sleep by yourself.

276
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:01,283
Without the violin.

277
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,023
Without your violin.

278
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,968
Thank you for coming so quickly.

279
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:25,939
Thank you so much, Doctor. Goodnight.

280
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:33,013
Feeling better?

281
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,717
Yes, thank you.

282
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:36,987
The doctor says your heart must have

283
00:36:37,061 --> 00:36:39,086
stopped for a minute.

284
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:40,862
I'm sorry.

285
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:41,954
It's alright,

286
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,467
but we don't want it to happen again.

287
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:47,966
Were you worried?

288
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:51,732
Were you nervous about the audition?

289
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,471
It will be... just fine.

290
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:56,713
You know that, don't you?

291
00:36:56,847 --> 00:36:57,814
Georges!

292
00:36:58,149 --> 00:36:59,776
I know, I know.

293
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:02,010
Kaspar, we want to tell you...

294
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:07,318
you don't have to do it if you don't want to.

295
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:09,392
You don't have to play.

296
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:11,089
I don't?

297
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:14,323
We can cancel the audition.

298
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:16,831
We'll manage, somehow.

299
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:21,002
It's better than making you sick, do you see?

300
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,332
You don't have to be famous.

301
00:37:23,874 --> 00:37:26,206
No? Yes.

302
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:31,181
Sorry. Malade.

303
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:35,319
I want to be famous.

304
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:38,119
Sir, I really do.

305
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:40,552
That's my boy.

306
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:42,485
I'm very proud of you.

307
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,225
I want you to rest, relax.

308
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:49,332
Madame Poussin will bring
a visitor you like very much.

309
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:09,884
Good!

310
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:12,548
There you go!

311
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:48,981
We better sleep now.

312
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:51,551
Tomorrow's going to be a busy day.

313
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:27,347
Perfect.

314
00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:30,356
And now, backwards. Are you ready?

315
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:12,125
Rejected! The shame!

316
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:24,511
Kaspar Weiss, violin!

317
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:27,145
Play the best you can.

318
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:28,478
Play your best.

319
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:03,777
Master Poussin and his protege, Kaspar Weiss.

320
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:19,230
Closer. Come closer.

321
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,401
So you're the wild child...

322
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:26,500
I've heard all about.

323
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:30,179
An orphan raised by monks.

324
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:33,747
If you prefer, we can call in the next...

325
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:35,415
There's the son of...

326
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:39,746
How charming to think a monastery has

327
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:44,794
actually produced something worthwhile.

328
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:49,830
That's a lovely instrument you have.

329
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:54,662
May I see it? May I see it, my boy?

330
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:08,484
Is it for sale?

331
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:12,451
I'd give you a good price for it.

332
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:16,715
He's very attached to his instrument.

333
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:18,389
So I see.

334
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,857
Perhaps after he's played...

335
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:25,602
Of course, let him play. I might take him too.

336
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:28,432
Come, play for me.

337
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:34,234
Won't you play something for me? Please.

338
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:36,211
Poussin!

339
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:45,915
Just play for him, son. Play.

340
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,831
Monsieur Poussin?

341
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:40,760
On behalf of the brothers I thank you...

342
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:44,274
for the generosity you showed Kaspar.

343
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:47,842
He takes with him the many gifts you gave him.

344
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:49,837
I did what I could.

345
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:51,779
Would you honor us by sharing

346
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:53,874
our modest supper?

347
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:56,276
It's very kind of you, but...

348
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:59,054
my wife awaits me,

349
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:01,321
all of Vienna awaits me.

350
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,954
Of course, we understand.

351
00:46:06,363 --> 00:46:07,830
I do have one question.

352
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,367
The violin...

353
00:46:14,738 --> 00:46:17,206
what will become of it?

354
00:46:18,008 --> 00:46:20,977
I'm sorry, I thought you knew.

355
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:24,677
Naturally you were foremost in our thoughts.

356
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:27,647
After all the time and energy you invested...

357
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:33,451
it would be wrong to give it to another child.

358
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:35,858
Yes, of course.

359
00:46:35,926 --> 00:46:38,053
So we buried it with the boy.

360
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,790
He can play it in heaven.

361
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:47,903
Yes, quite right.

362
00:47:01,585 --> 00:47:07,888
And then I see a time of life...

363
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:11,259
a time of lust of energy...

364
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:16,627
Ioosed across mountains and oceans, and time.

365
00:47:19,436 --> 00:47:21,495
Confusing, madame, I know.

366
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:23,563
But I see it.

367
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:25,870
I'm certain.

368
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:29,445
Yours is a Lazarus soul.

369
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,444
We're on hold.

370
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:52,917
You'd tell her our story, explain its past.

371
00:49:52,956 --> 00:49:55,220
Brother, please, she doesn't care.

372
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:56,824
She's doing her job.

373
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:58,825
But if you convince her...

374
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:28,624
I feel helpless.

375
00:50:28,759 --> 00:50:30,226
Isn't there something we can do?

376
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:33,994
Yes... we can pray.

377
00:50:57,087 --> 00:51:03,492
And then... a man comes into your life...

378
00:51:03,827 --> 00:51:07,627
a handsome man, and intelligent.

379
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:13,635
He'll seduce you with his talent and worse.

380
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:17,905
In short, he's the Devil.

381
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:06,672
It's there, Duval's.
