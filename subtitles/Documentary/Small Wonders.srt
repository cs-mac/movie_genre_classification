1
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,079
Why are we here?
Where do we come from?

2
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,679
These are the most enduring
of questions.

3
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,199
And it's an essential part of human
nature to want to find the answers.

4
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,919
Now, we can trace our ancestry back
hundreds of thousands of years

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,879
to the dawn of humankind.

6
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,679
But in reality, our story extends
far further back in time.

7
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,639
Our story starts with
the beginning of the universe.

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,119
It began 13.7 billion years ago.

9
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,719
And today, it's filled with over
a hundred billion galaxies,

10
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,799
each containing
hundreds of billions of stars.

11
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,919
In this series,
I want to tell that story.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,559
Because ultimately,
we are part of the universe.

13
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,759
So its story is our story.

14
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,559
This film is about
the stuff that makes us

15
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,719
and where it all came from.

16
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,639
Because understanding our own origins

17
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,359
means understanding
the lives of stars...

18
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,879
...and how their catastrophic deaths
bring new life to the universe.

19
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,559
Because every mountain,
every rock on this planet,

20
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,399
every living thing,
every piece of you and me

21
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,799
was forged in the furnaces of space.

22
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,639
This is Pashupatinath in
the Nepalese capital city of Kathmandu.

23
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,439
And Hindus come here from
all over India and Nepal

24
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,799
to worship the god Shiva.

25
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,479
In fact, that is Shiva's temple.

26
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,679
Now, Shiva is the god of destruction.

27
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,719
In the Hindu faith,
everything has to be destroyed

28
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,959
so that new things can be created.

29
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,119
And that's why pilgrims come here
to the banks of the Bagmati River

30
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,399
at the foot of Shiva's temple.

31
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,239
The belief in this cycle of
creation and destruction

32
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,159
lends Pashupatinath
an added significance.

33
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,599
Many of these pilgrims will have come
here at the end of their lives,

34
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,799
to die here and be cremated.

35
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:42,439
Hindus believe in reincarnation, an
eternal sequence of death and rebirth.

36
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,519
Cremation helps free the soul,
so it's ready for the next life.

37
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,679
They also believe that
the physical elements of the body

38
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,839
are released back to the world

39
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,999
so they can be recycled
in the next stage of creation.

40
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,919
It's an ancient belief
that touches on a deeper truth

41
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,199
about how the universe works.

42
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,639
Every civilization, every religion
across the world has a creation story.

43
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,319
It tells of where we came from,
of how we came to be here

44
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,919
and of what will happen when we die.

45
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,519
Well, I have a different
creation story to tell,

46
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,879
and it's based entirely on
physics and cosmology.

47
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,239
Now, it can tell us what we're made of
and where we came from.

48
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,719
In fact, it can tell us
what everything in the world

49
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,359
is made of and where it came from.

50
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,359
It also answers
that most basic of human needs,

51
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,079
to feel part of something much bigger.

52
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,519
Because to tell this story,

53
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,879
you have to understand
the history of the universe.

54
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,759
And it teaches us that
the path to enlightenment

55
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,999
is not an understanding
of our own lives and deaths,

56
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,519
but the lives and deaths of the stars.

57
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,479
My creation story is the story
of how we were made by the universe.

58
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,319
It explains how every atom in our bodies
was formed not on Earth,

59
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,039
but was created in the depths of space,

60
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,519
through the epic life cycle
of the stars.

61
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,959
And to understand that story,

62
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,759
we will journey to the stars
in all their stages of life.

63
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,519
This is where stars are born, a nebula,

64
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,959
a stellar nursery,
where new stars burst into life.

65
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,199
Those stars will burn
for billions of years,

66
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,199
until their voracious hunger for fuel
forces them to blow up,

67
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,879
to become giants

68
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,799
hundreds of times the size of our sun.

69
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,759
And when they die, stars go out with
the biggest bang in the universe.

70
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,039
But to understand
how we came from the stars,

71
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,399
we must begin our journey
much closer to home.

72
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,319
Well, this is sunrise over Nepal

73
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,159
and those are the tallest mountains
in the world, the Himalayas.

74
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,919
I mean, every one of those peaks
is over six and a half thousand metres.

75
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,359
What a spectacular sight.

76
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,919
But it's incredible to think that just
a few tens of millions of years ago,

77
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,999
those mountains were
something very different.

78
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,799
The Himalayas haven't always
been mountains.

79
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,319
We can find clues to their true origin
by looking at them more closely.

80
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,519
This is Himalayan limestone,

81
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:07,799
the rock out of which much of
this magnificent mountain range is made.

82
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:12,239
Now, if you look closely, you can see
a kind of chalky, granular structure.

83
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,799
Because limestone is made primarily
out of the bodies,

84
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:20,199
the shells of dead sea creatures,
of coral and polyps.

85
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,079
And when they die, they are put under
immense pressures and squashed

86
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,719
and eventually form limestone.

87
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,119
So the Himalayas
were once living creatures.

88
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,799
Much of the rock in the Himalayas
was formed at the bottom of an ocean.

89
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,999
And then over millions of years, it was
raised up to become these vast peaks.

90
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,039
We've even found fossils
at the top of Mount Everest.

91
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,479
It's a beautiful example of the endless
recycling of the Earth's resources

92
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,599
that has been going on
since the dawn of time.

93
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,879
And we are part of that system.

94
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,919
Every atom in my body was
once part of something else.

95
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,839
So an ancient tree
or a dinosaur or a rock,

96
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,439
in fact, definitely a rock.

97
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,319
And the reason that the rocks
of the Earth can become living things

98
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,879
and then living things
will return to the rocks of the Earth

99
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:23,919
is because everything is made
of the same basic ingredients.

100
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,159
Those ingredients are
the chemical elements,

101
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,159
the building blocks
of everything on Earth.

102
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:45,639
Elements like hydrogen, helium, lithium,
beryllium, boron, carbon, nitrogen,

103
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,839
oxygen, fluorine, neon,
sodium, magnesium,

104
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,639
aluminium, silicon, phosphorus...

105
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,639
Everything in the world is made up of
the same basic set of chemical elements,

106
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,679
just assembled in different ways.

107
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,759
So these mountains, the Himalayas,
are made of limestone.

108
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,959
And that's calcium carbonate.

109
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,479
Now, calcium, carbon and oxygen

110
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,799
are three of the elements
that are vital for life.

111
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,039
The calcium in my teeth and bones,
oxygen in the air that I breathe

112
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,439
and carbon in
every organic molecule in my body.

113
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,559
Now, you're probably pretty familiar

114
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,079
with those elements
in their combined forms,

115
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,719
but you very rarely
see the elements on their own.

116
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,519
There's a good reason
why many of the elements

117
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,439
are not found in
their raw forms in nature.

118
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,199
They are extremely reactive.

119
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,239
This is sodium.

120
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:50,959
As you can see, it's a silvery metal.
It's also quite reactive.

121
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,679
In fact, it's so reactive
that when you drop it into water,

122
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,559
you get a violent,
almost explosive, reaction.

123
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,119
Which is all the more surprising

124
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,839
when you think that
when combined with chlorine,

125
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,039
this forms sodium chloride,

126
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,039
salt, which is vital for life.

127
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,519
Excellent.

128
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,799
And that's why I love chemistry
almost as much as physics.

129
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,359
It's this reactivity
that enables the elements

130
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,599
to combine with one another
to make new substances.

131
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,599
It's gone.
Where the hell's it gone?

132
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,919
That, in turn, has allowed the Earth
to develop its endless variety.

133
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,399
And that variety includes us.

134
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,639
So to explain where we come from,

135
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,559
we must also explain
where the elements come from.

136
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,639
We now know that the Earth
is made of 92 chemical elements.

137
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,479
And that's pretty amazing, if you think
of the complexity that we see around us.

138
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,199
We also know that
everything beyond Earth,

139
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:18,759
everything we can see in the universe,
is made of those same 92 elements.

140
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,639
And notice that I didn't say
we think that's what they're made of.

141
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,759
I said we know
that's what they're made of,

142
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,959
because we can prove it.

143
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,799
The chemistry set we have on Earth
extends far beyond the planet.

144
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,559
We have set foot on the moon

145
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,719
and know that it's rich in
helium, silver and water.

146
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,439
We've sent robot landers
to our neighbouring planets

147
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,199
and discovered that Mars
is rich in iron,

148
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:02,559
which has combined with oxygen
to form its familiar rusty red colour.

149
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,719
And we know that Venus'
thick atmosphere is full of sulphur.

150
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,279
We've sent spacecraft
to the edge of the solar system

151
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:20,799
to discover that Neptune is rich
in organic molecules like methane.

152
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,159
But what of the rest of the universe?

153
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,119
It seems impossible that we could
discover what the stars are made of

154
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,759
because they're so far away.

155
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,919
Even the nearest star, Proxima Centauri,

156
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,359
is ten thousand times
more distant than Neptune,

157
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,719
4.2 light years from Earth.

158
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:03,279
And the nearest galaxy, Andromeda,
is another 2.5 million light years away.

159
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,439
Yet despite these vast distances,

160
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,119
these alien worlds are
constantly sending us signals,

161
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,559
telling us exactly
what they are made of.

162
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,199
Our only contact with the distant stars

163
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:24,119
is their light that's journeyed
across the universe to reach us.

164
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,519
And encoded in that light

165
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,399
is the key to understanding
what the universe is made of.

166
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,319
And it's all down to a particular
property of the chemical elements.

167
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,359
You see, when you heat the elements,
when you burn them,

168
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,159
then they give off light.

169
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,959
And each element gives off
its own unique set of colours.

170
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:50,159
So this is strontium and it burns
with a beautiful red colour.

171
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,719
Sodium is yellow.

172
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,999
Potassium is lilac.

173
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,559
And copper is blue.

174
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,679
Each element has
its own characteristic colour.

175
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,119
It's this property that tells us
what the stars are made of.

176
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,079
But it's a little more complicated

177
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,919
than simply looking at the colour
of the light that each star emits.

178
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,519
You can see why by looking at the light
from our nearest star, the sun.

179
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,599
This is a spectrum of
the light taken from our sun.

180
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,399
And at first glance
it looks very familiar,

181
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,199
it looks like a stretched-out rainbow,

182
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,239
because that's exactly
what a rainbow is,

183
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,279
it's the spectrum of the light
from the sun in the sky.

184
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,639
But if you look a bit more closely,

185
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,399
then you see that
this spectrum is covered in black lines.

186
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,159
These are called absorption lines.

187
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,879
Each element within our sun

188
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,519
not only emits light
of a certain colour,

189
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,559
it also absorbs light
of the same colour.

190
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,399
By looking for these black lines
in the sun's light,

191
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:22,079
we can simply read off a list of its
constituent elements, like a barcode.

192
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,639
For example, these two black lines

193
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,279
in the yellow bit of the spectrum
are sodium.

194
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:34,159
You can see iron.
Right down here, you can see hydrogen.

195
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,079
So by looking at these lines
in precise detail,

196
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,279
you can work out exactly
what elements are present in the sun.

197
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,279
And it turns out that
that's about 70% hydrogen,

198
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,759
28% helium and 2% the rest.

199
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,199
And you can do this
not only for the sun,

200
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:55,119
but for any of the stars
you can see in the sky,

201
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,959
and you can measure exactly
what they're made of.

202
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:08,319
So that star there is Polaris,
the pole star. And you can see that

203
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,999
because all the other stars in the
night sky appear to rotate around it.

204
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,879
Now, it's 430 light years away.

205
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,239
But we know just by looking at the light

206
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:26,199
that it has about the same
heavy element abundance as our sun,

207
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,839
but it's got markedly less carbon
and a lot more nitrogen.

208
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,359
And the same applies for other stars.

209
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,439
Vega, the second brightest star
in the northern sky,

210
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,999
has only about a third of
the metal content of our sun,

211
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,679
whereas other stars are metal-heavy.

212
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,759
Sirius, the dog star, contains
three times as much iron as the sun.

213
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,159
And Proxima Centauri
is rich in magnesium.

214
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,679
But although the quantities of
the elements may vary,

215
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,999
wherever we look across space,

216
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,239
we only ever find the same
92 elements that we find on Earth.

217
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,759
We are made of the same stuff
as the stars and the galaxies.

218
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,119
But where did all this matter come from?

219
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,319
And how did it become
the complex universe we see today?

220
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,479
In order to understand
where we came from,

221
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,839
we have to understand events
that happened

222
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,439
in the first few seconds
of the life of the universe.

223
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,759
You see, when the universe began,
it was unimaginably hot and dense.

224
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,719
We literally don't have
the scientific language to describe it.

225
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,999
But it was,
in a very real sense, beautiful.

226
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:41,039
There was no structure,
there was certainly no matter.

227
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,719
It was exactly the same,
whichever way you look at it.

228
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,759
We can get some idea
of how the universe developed

229
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,239
from this state of pure symmetry

230
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,879
by looking at the behaviour of water
in this remarkable landscape.

231
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,679
These are the El Tatio geysers,
high in the Chilean Andes.

232
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,079
As the boiling water
bubbles up through the ground

233
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,399
to meet the freezing mountain air,

234
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,839
water can be found in
all three of its natural phases,

235
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,519
vapour, liquid and ice.

236
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,839
In its hottest state,
water is, like the early universe,

237
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,559
an undifferentiated cloud.

238
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:40,479
But as it cools,
it suddenly behaves very differently.

239
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,799
You see, if you look at
a cloud of steam,

240
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,359
it looks the same from every direction,

241
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:55,039
but as it cools down, as it lands on
this plate of freezing cold glass,

242
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:01,119
then it immediately crystallises out,
it turns into solid water, ice.

243
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,559
As the ice crystals form,

244
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,319
the symmetry of the water vapour
disappears from view

245
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,839
and complex,
beautiful structure emerges.

246
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,919
In the same way, we think that
the universe, as it cooled,

247
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,639
went through a series of these events
where structure emerged.

248
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,439
One of the most important

249
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,679
was about a billionth of a second
after the Big Bang.

250
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,359
In that moment, an important part of
the symmetry of the universe was broken.

251
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,999
Known as electroweak symmetry breaking,

252
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,479
this was the moment when
subatomic particles acquired mass,

253
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,799
substance for the first time.

254
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,999
Amongst them were the quarks.

255
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,919
As the universe continued to cool,

256
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,159
those quarks joined together
to form larger, more complex structures

257
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,399
called protons and neutrons.

258
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,799
Way before the universe
was a minute old,

259
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,039
the quarks had been locked away
inside the protons and the neutrons.

260
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,639
They are the building blocks
of all atomic nuclei,

261
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,239
the building blocks of the elements.

262
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,799
These same protons and neutrons
are with us to this day.

263
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,479
They form the hearts,
the nuclei, of all atoms.

264
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,679
Just a few seconds after
the beginning of the universe,

265
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:58,879
the fundamental building blocks
of everything had been created.

266
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,359
Well, it sounds ridiculous.

267
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,799
The fact that everything you need
to make up me

268
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,759
and everything on planet Earth

269
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,759
and, in fact, every star and
every galaxy in the sky

270
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:20,519
was there after the first minutes
in the life of the universe.

271
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,079
It's almost unbelievable,

272
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,239
but we have extremely strong
experimental evidence

273
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,719
to suggest that that is
the way that it is.

274
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:34,039
Well, from that point on,
it was just, in a sense,

275
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:41,079
a process of assembling those bits
into more and more complex things.

276
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,359
That is an incredibly
fascinating story in itself.

277
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,159
To tell that story,

278
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,719
we must look deep inside the atom,
to the nucleus at its centre.

279
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,039
Here we can see how
protons and neutrons are assembled

280
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,079
to build up the 92 different elements.

281
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:29,479
Now, the wonderful thing about the
construction of the chemical elements

282
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,479
is that it's so simple.

283
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,919
I suppose you could
call it child's play.

284
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,879
So imagine these bubbles are
my universal chemistry set.

285
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,759
And the single bubbles
would just be single protons.

286
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,159
That's the nucleus
of the simplest chemical element.

287
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,079
The element with a single proton
in its nucleus is hydrogen.

288
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,679
And from hydrogen,
you can make all the other elements.

289
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,799
The first stage
is to stick two protons together.

290
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:20,279
Look at that!
That was two bubbles stuck together.

291
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,079
Now, what happens when you stick
two protons together is

292
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,519
one of the protons turns into a neutron.

293
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,759
And that is called deuterium.

294
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,719
Deuterium is still a form of hydrogen,

295
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,959
because it has only one proton
in its nucleus

296
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,639
and it is the number of protons
that defines the element.

297
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,639
It's only when
two deuterium nuclei are combined

298
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,959
that a new element is created.

299
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,479
Take two deuteriums
and fuse them together

300
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,439
and you get a nucleus with
two protons and two neutrons.

301
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,999
That's helium,
the second simplest element.

302
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:05,599
And then it's just a question of adding
more and more protons and neutrons.

303
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,159
Well, there's an incredibly
complicated nucleus.

304
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,399
That's about 12 things stuck together.

305
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,599
So that would be probably carbon-12,
which is six protons and six neutrons.

306
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,119
And you can carry on building
more and more complex elements

307
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:30,199
all the way up to
the heaviest element in the universe,

308
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,519
to uranium and beyond.

309
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,679
Simple and beautiful physics.

310
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,399
This process of building the elements
is called nuclear fusion.

311
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,319
It allows the simplest of ingredients

312
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,519
to create the infinite variety
of the universe.

313
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:02,599
But although this bubble metaphor makes
creating new elements seem simple,

314
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,799
it is in reality incredibly
difficult to achieve...

315
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:16,119
so difficult that there's only place
in nature that it happens.

316
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,919
It's in stars like our sun
that the elements are assembled.

317
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:39,319
They are the only places in the universe
hot enough and dense enough

318
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,399
to fuse atoms together.

319
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,679
Even then, only a fraction of the star

320
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,679
reaches the extreme
temperatures necessary.

321
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,799
The sun is 6000 degrees Celsius
at its surface,

322
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,919
not nearly hot enough to power fusion.

323
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:06,159
But deep below, where the temperature
reaches 15 million degrees,

324
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:11,119
the sun fuses hydrogen into helium
at a furious rate.

325
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,239
Every second it burns
600 million tonnes of hydrogen.

326
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:26,799
As it does so, it releases
the huge amounts of heat and light

327
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,719
that brings our planet to life.

328
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,599
It is this process of
converting one element into another

329
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,639
that allows us to exist.

330
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,239
But for all its power,
the sun only converts

331
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,639
hydrogen, the simplest element,
into helium, the next simplest.

332
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,359
But there are over 90 other elements
present in our universe.

333
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,839
So where did they all come from?

334
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,999
If the heavier elements are not
being made in stars like the sun,

335
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:09,199
then there must be somewhere else in
the universe where they are assembled.

336
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,839
It's important to know,

337
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:15,839
because it's the elements beyond helium
that give our world its complexity.

338
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,839
And when it comes to planet Earth
and human beings,

339
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:22,279
there's one element
that is particularly important.

340
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,559
Carbon.

341
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,279
Life is completely dependent on carbon.

342
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:33,719
I mean, I'm made of about a billion
billion billon carbon atoms,

343
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:39,599
as is every human being out there,
every living thing on the planet.

344
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,279
Imagine how many carbon atoms that is.

345
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,799
So where does
all that carbon come from?

346
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,679
Well, it comes from the only place in
the universe where elements are made.

347
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,999
Stars.

348
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:55,719
But in order for us to live,
a star must die.

349
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,639
Stars in the prime of their lives,
like our sun,

350
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,199
are only hot enough to make helium.

351
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,759
Forming the heavier elements
requires much higher temperatures,

352
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,799
temperatures that can only be reached
at the end of a star's life.

353
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,079
Looking out into space,

354
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:28,519
you might think that the cosmos
is a constant, unchanging place,

355
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,079
the stars will always be there.

356
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:37,119
But in fact, the stars are only
a temporary feature in the sky.

357
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,839
And though they may burn brightly
for many millions or billions of years,

358
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,359
they can only live for as long as
they have a supply of hydrogen to burn.

359
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,959
When a star runs out of hydrogen,
it begins to die.

360
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,199
But it doesn't go quietly.

361
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:01,639
Rather than cooling,
the star becomes much hotter,

362
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,919
until there's a sudden flash.

363
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,319
Then the star starts to expand.

364
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,399
Over tens of thousands of years,

365
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,399
it balloons to many hundreds of times
its previous size.

366
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,839
But in this bloated state,

367
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,919
the star is unable to
maintain its surface temperature.

368
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:32,999
As it cools, it takes on the
characteristic colour of a dying star.

369
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,119
It has become a red giant.

370
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:48,119
These are pictures of
a red giant star in our galaxy,

371
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,879
a star called Betelgeuse.

372
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,479
Now, it's one of our nearest neighbours
in cosmic terms,

373
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,319
it's only about 600 light years away.

374
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,279
But it's the size that's astonishing.

375
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:03,119
If you were to put the sun there,
then Venus would be about there,

376
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,079
and the Earth about there,
and Mars here.

377
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,159
And in fact, you could fit
everything in the solar system

378
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,119
all the way out to Jupiter
inside the star.

379
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,639
Now, because it's so big,
even though it is 600 light years away,

380
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,039
you can see detail on its surface.

381
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,879
So these, these are sunspots on
the surface of Betelgeuse.

382
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,999
But it's not what's going on on
the surface that's really interesting.

383
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,799
To understand where carbon
comes from in the universe,

384
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:38,159
we have to understand what's going on
deep in the heart of the star.

385
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:07,079
Imagine this old prison in Rio
is a dying star like Betelgeuse.

386
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:12,959
Out there is the bright surface,
shining off into space.

387
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:17,079
As I descend deeper and deeper
into the prison,

388
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:22,839
the conditions will become hotter
and hotter and denser and denser,

389
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:28,279
until down there, in the heart
of the star, is the core,

390
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,119
and it's in there that all
the ingredients of life are made.

391
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,919
Deep in its core,

392
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,239
the star is fighting a futile battle
against its own gravity.

393
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:48,879
As it desperately tries to stop itself
collapsing under its own weight,

394
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,439
new elements are made
in a sequence of separate stages.

395
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:02,639
Stage one is while there is still
a supply of hydrogen to burn.

396
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,839
Whilst the star is burning hydrogen
to helium in the core,

397
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:18,039
vast amounts of energy are released,
and that energy escapes,

398
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:23,399
literally creating an outward pressure
which balances the force of gravity

399
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:27,079
and, well, it holds the star up
and keeps it stable.

400
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:31,159
But eventually the hydrogen in the core
will run out

401
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,839
and at that point,
the fusion reactions will stop,

402
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,239
no more energy will be released,

403
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,199
and that outward pressure
will disappear.

404
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:45,519
Now, at that point, the core will start
to collapse very rapidly,

405
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,159
leaving a shell

406
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,559
of hydrogen and helium behind.

407
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,359
Beneath this shell,
as the core collapses,

408
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,439
the temperature rises again,

409
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:09,519
until, at a hundred million degrees,
stage two starts

410
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:13,039
and helium nuclei
begin to fuse together.

411
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,959
Now, helium fusion does two things.

412
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:29,239
Firstly, more energy is released,
and so the collapse is halted.

413
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,559
But secondly, two more elements
are produced in that process.

414
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,239
Carbon,

415
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,959
oxygen. Two elements vital for life.

416
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:50,519
So this is where all the carbon
in the universe comes from.

417
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,839
Every atom of carbon in my hand,

418
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,159
every atom of carbon in
every living thing on the planet

419
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,679
was produced in
the heart of a dying star.

420
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,239
Now, compared to the lifetime of a star,

421
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:12,679
the creation process of carbon and
oxygen is over in the blink of an eye,

422
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,639
because in only about a million years,

423
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:19,239
the supply of helium
in the core is used up,

424
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:23,839
and for stars as massive as the sun,
that's where fusion stops,

425
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,879
because there isn't
enough gravitational energy

426
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,679
to compress the core any further
and restart fusion.

427
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:36,919
But for massive stars like Betelgeuse,
the fusion process can continue.

428
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,879
When the helium runs out,

429
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,759
gravity takes over again
and the collapse continues.

430
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:54,719
The temperature rises once more,
launching stage three,

431
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:01,559
in which carbon fuses into magnesium,
neon, sodium and aluminium.

432
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,999
And so it goes on, core collapse,

433
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:09,799
followed by the next stage of fusion
to create more elements,

434
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:14,559
each stage hotter and shorter
than the last.

435
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:22,439
And eventually, in a final stage
that lasts only a couple of days,

436
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:29,199
the heart of the star is transformed
into almost pure iron,

437
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,759
whose chemical symbol is Fe.

438
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,799
This is where the fusion process stops.

439
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,599
In its millions of years of life,

440
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,559
the star has made
all the common elements,

441
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,999
the stuff that makes up
99% of the Earth.

442
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,039
The core is now a solid ball
of those elements,

443
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,799
stacked on top of each other in layers.

444
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,879
On the outside,
there's a shell of hydrogen,

445
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,639
beneath it a layer of helium,

446
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:09,239
then carbon and oxygen
and all the other elements,

447
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,399
all the way down to
the very heart of the star.

448
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,399
And once that has fused into solid iron,

449
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,879
the star has only seconds left to live.

450
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,039
When a star runs out of fuel,

451
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:28,039
then it can no longer release energy
through fusion reactions,

452
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,159
and then there's only one thing
that can happen.

453
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,959
In about the same amount of time
it takes this prison block to crumble,

454
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,999
the entire star falls in on itself.

455
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,159
This is the destiny that awaits
most of the stars in the universe.

456
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:17,079
Yet even the implosion of a star
only forges the first 26 elements.

457
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:23,279
What of the remaining elements,
some of which are vital for life,

458
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,119
and many of which we hold most precious?

459
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,719
These are the remote forests
of northern California.

460
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:55,039
A hundred years ago,
this whole area was teeming with people,

461
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,359
all in search of one element.

462
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,799
And the reason they were here
can still be found

463
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,239
in the Original Sixteen to One mine.

464
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:17,599
This once stood at the centre
of the California gold rush.

465
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,399
And thanks to a quirk of geology,

466
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,799
it continues to yield its precious
bounty over a hundred years later.

467
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:32,399
The unique thing about this place
is that it sits right on the divide

468
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,239
between the North American plate
and the Pacific plate.

469
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:41,239
You see a divide there,
between the rock and quartz.

470
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,239
And then right up there
you can see the top of it.

471
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:48,319
Now, in between the faults,
this rock, the quartz, formed.

472
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,959
Then 140 million years ago,
in the Jurassic period,

473
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:56,279
when the dinosaurs were
running around above our heads,

474
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,279
hot water welled up and flowed.

475
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:04,959
And that water deposited the gold
through the seams of quartz.

476
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,119
And so, all the miners have to do,

477
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,639
all they have to do
is follow the seams of quartz,

478
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:16,519
and over hundreds of years they've found
vast amounts of gold deposited there.

479
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,639
Well, this is what
all the fuss is about.

480
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,639
This is the gold
as it comes out of the ground.

481
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:43,919
And it's unusually pure, as gold goes.
This is about 85% pure gold.

482
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,119
But it can also be found like this.

483
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,479
And this is a gold nugget that was
found in a river, on a riverbed.

484
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,319
And it's a heavy piece of gold,

485
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,759
it's between about one
and one and a half ounces,

486
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:01,679
which means that at today's prices,
it's worth about $2,000.

487
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:07,439
And it's that inherent value that makes
mines like this worth operating.

488
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:27,599
But there's something a bit odd
about the value we attach to gold.

489
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,799
Throughout history, people have
gone to extraordinary lengths

490
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,199
to get their hands on
this most precious substance.

491
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,839
Which is strange, because it isn't
particularly useful for anything.

492
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:43,519
Most of the gold that's been
extracted throughout human history

493
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,639
has ended up as jewellery.

494
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,359
But it has got one thing going for it,
and that's that it is incredibly rare.

495
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,279
All the gold mined from the Earth
in all of human history

496
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,399
would only just fill
three Olympic-sized swimming pools.

497
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,279
And it's that scarcity
that makes gold valuable.

498
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:10,359
But gold is just one of
many rare elements.

499
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:16,319
There over 60 elements
heavier than iron in the universe.

500
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:20,879
Some are valuable like gold,
silver, platinum.

501
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:25,159
Some are vital for life,
like copper and zinc.

502
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:30,119
And some are just useful.
Like uranium, tin and lead.

503
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,599
But across the universe,

504
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:36,439
there are vanishingly small amounts
of those heavy elements.

505
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,959
The reason for that scarcity

506
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:43,679
is that creating substantial amounts
of the heaviest elements

507
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,239
requires some of
the rarest conditions in the universe.

508
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,359
And we need to look far into space
to find them.

509
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,519
In a galaxy of a hundred billion stars,

510
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:01,919
these conditions will exist, on average,
for less than a minute in every century.

511
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,439
That's because they are only created

512
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,999
in the final death throes
of the very largest stars,

513
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,119
stars of at least
nine times the mass of our sun.

514
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,679
Only they can reach
the extreme temperatures needed

515
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,759
to create large amounts
of the heavy elements.

516
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:40,479
Deep in the heart of the star,
the core finally succumbs to gravity.

517
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:50,399
It falls in on itself
with enormous speed...

518
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:01,679
and rebounds with colossal force.

519
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,359
As the blast wave collides with
the outer layers of the star,

520
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,759
it generates the highest temperatures
in the universe,

521
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,919
a hundred billion degrees.

522
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:25,159
These conditions last
for just 15 seconds,

523
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:28,879
but it's enough to form
the heaviest elements, like gold.

524
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,999
It's called a supernova,

525
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,719
the most powerful explosion
in the universe.

526
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,879
You know, it's quite a thought
that something as precious to us

527
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,439
as the gold in a wedding ring

528
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,719
was actually forged in
the death of a distant star

529
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,479
millions of light years away,
billions of years ago.

530
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,639
Despite the rarity of supernovae,

531
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:15,799
when they do happen, they are
the most dramatic events in the sky.

532
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,959
This is a picture of
the Tarantula Nebula,

533
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,519
which is a cloud of gas and dust

534
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:27,799
in the Large Magellanic cloud, which is
a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way.

535
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:32,799
And this is what it looks like
on any clear, starry night of the year.

536
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:39,159
But on one night in 1987,
the Tarantula Nebula looked like that.

537
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:43,199
You see that a new, bright star
has appeared in the sky.

538
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:49,079
This is a supernova explosion,
the explosive death of a massive star.

539
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:53,639
And they are incredibly violent
cosmic events,

540
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,439
as this picture beautifully shows.

541
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:00,919
This is a galaxy about
55 million light years away from Earth,

542
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:05,439
but this is a supernova explosion
in that galaxy.

543
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:09,159
And you see that it is shining
as brightly as the galactic core.

544
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,479
There may be a billion suns
in that core,

545
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:17,279
and one supernova
can shine as brightly as that.

546
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:23,759
Yet to really appreciate
the scale of these explosions,

547
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,479
we would need to see one up close,

548
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,759
to see a star die in our own galaxy,
the Milky Way.

549
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:37,399
Although on average there's one big
supernova in each galaxy every century,

550
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:41,959
there hasn't been one in the Milky Way
since the birth of modern science.

551
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:46,879
The last was in 1604,
so we're long overdue.

552
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:50,239
Astronomers are now searching the skies

553
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:53,919
for the star that is
most likely to go supernova.

554
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:57,839
And amongst the leading candidates,
there's a familiar name.

555
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:03,679
This is the constellation of Orion,
and this is Betelgeuse.

556
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,679
And we know it's extremely unstable

557
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:12,999
because it's dimmed by about 15%
in the last 10 years.

558
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:18,799
Now, astronomers think that this star
could go supernova at any moment.

559
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,119
That could mean
any time in the next million years,

560
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,879
but equally it could explode tomorrow.

561
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:33,159
And Betelgeuse is only
600 light years away.

562
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:40,439
Now, when it goes,
Betelgeuse will be incredibly bright.

563
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:45,519
It will be by far
the brightest star in the sky.

564
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:48,359
It may shine as brightly as a full moon.

565
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:52,799
It will be almost a second sun
in the daylight.

566
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,279
In this single instant,
Betelgeuse will release more energy

567
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:21,519
than our sun will produce
in its entire lifetime.

568
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:31,559
As the star is torn apart,
it will fire out into space

569
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:36,479
all the elements
that it created in its life and death.

570
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:41,639
Those elements will spread out
to become a nebula,

571
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:45,239
a rich chemical cloud
drifting through space.

572
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:51,079
And at the heart of the nebula
will be a tiny beacon of light,

573
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:57,439
the remnant of a star, once more than
a billion and a half kilometres across,

574
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:01,839
that has been crushed
out of all recognition by gravity.

575
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,559
This is Betelgeuse, the neutron star.

576
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:17,959
And it's how this once mighty star
will end its life.

577
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,239
Now, once Betelgeuse is gone,

578
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:37,839
the constellation of Orion
will look very different.

579
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,119
I mean,
there'll just be a hole in the sky

580
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:45,039
where that brilliant,
bright red star once shone.

581
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:50,319
But it's in the deaths of old stars
that new stars are born.

582
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:55,239
It's very much like the cycle
of death and rebirth here on Earth,

583
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:57,279
but played out on a cosmic scale.

584
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:01,999
And you can see that happening today
in the constellation of Orion,

585
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:07,479
because in the sword handle,
you can see this, the Orion nebula.

586
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,079
Now, it's nothing more than

587
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:13,359
a misty patch of light in
the night sky to the naked eye.

588
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,879
But if you look more closely, you see
that there is a lot more going on.

589
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:28,119
The Orion nebula is one of
the wonders of the universe.

590
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:37,199
Hidden in its clouds
are bright points of light.

591
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,559
These are new stars

592
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:47,079
forming from the elements
blown out by supernova explosions.

593
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:56,639
New stars being born
from the remains of dead ones.

594
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:04,359
And it's from this universal process
of death and rebirth that we emerged,

595
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:10,839
because it was in a nebula
just like this, five billion years ago,

596
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:14,759
that our sun was formed.

597
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,919
Around it, a network of planets formed.

598
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,279
Among them was the Earth.

599
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:37,719
Everything we find on the Earth today
also originated in that nebula.

600
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:46,119
But that is not the end of the story
of how the universe created us.

601
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:52,879
Because when we look
deep into the nebula,

602
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,399
we don't just see individual elements,

603
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:59,759
we see greater complexity,
the seeds of our own existence.

604
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:05,199
This is a spectrum of
the light from the Orion nebula

605
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,359
taken by the Herschel space telescope.

606
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:11,919
So it really is a picture of light
from interstellar space.

607
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:15,639
You know, I wouldn't normally show you
a graph like this,

608
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:18,759
but this is fascinating,
because what it shows

609
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:21,799
is that that gas cloud,
the Orion nebula,

610
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:24,839
is not just a cloud of elements.

611
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:28,679
There's complex chemistry here
happening in deep space.

612
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:32,399
Because each peak on this graph
corresponds to a different molecule

613
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:36,359
and there are some molecules present
that I suppose are quite obvious.

614
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:39,519
There's water, there's sulphur dioxide.

615
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,959
But there are also
complex carbon compounds in here.

616
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,919
So there's methanol,
there's hydrogen cyanide,

617
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,599
there's formaldehyde,
there's dimethyl ether.

618
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:52,199
So what we're seeing here
is complex carbon chemistry

619
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:54,239
happening in deep space.

620
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:04,159
That carbon chemistry is the beginning
of the chemistry of life.

621
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:08,759
And there is surprising evidence
that this chemistry

622
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:12,839
may have had a direct impact
on the evolution of life on Earth.

623
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:22,479
That evidence comes from meteorites,

624
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:28,559
debris left over from
the formation of the solar system

625
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,479
that occasionally collides
with the Earth.

626
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:45,039
One of the most productive places
for finding meteorites

627
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:48,959
is the Atacama Desert
in the High Andes of South America.

628
00:54:58,840 --> 00:54:59,999
This is a meteorite,

629
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:05,719
a piece of rock that fell to Earth from
somewhere out there in the solar system.

630
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:10,839
And it is certainly older
than any rock you can see here.

631
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:15,919
It's probably older than any rock
you can find anywhere on Earth,

632
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,679
because it formed from
the primordial gas cloud,

633
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,799
that nebula that collapsed

634
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:25,359
to form the sun and the planets
over four and a half billion years ago.

635
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,519
So it's incredibly ancient.

636
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:33,319
Now, this is a slice,
a cross-section through a meteorite.

637
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,159
You see those little
brown areas in there?

638
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:41,559
Well, in those brown areas
we've found amino acids,

639
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:43,959
the building blocks of proteins,

640
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:48,119
which are the building blocks of me,
the building blocks of life.

641
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,959
Incredibly complex carbon compounds.

642
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:56,239
So this says that
the complex carbon chemistry you need

643
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:59,319
to send you on the path to life

644
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:04,079
was happening out there in space
four and a half billion years ago.

645
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:17,679
So the first amino acids on Earth,
the fundamental building blocks of life,

646
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,519
may have formed in the depths of space

647
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:23,599
and been delivered to the Earth
on meteorites.

648
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:37,399
When we look out into space,
we are looking into our own origins,

649
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,879
because we are truly
children of the stars.

650
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:51,399
And written into every atom
and every molecule of our bodies

651
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:57,119
is the entire history of the universe,
from the Big Bang to the present day.

652
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:05,719
Our story is the story of the universe.

653
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:07,999
Every piece of everyone,

654
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:11,519
of everything you love
and everything you hate,

655
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:17,479
of the thing you hold most precious,
was assembled by the forces of nature

656
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:20,919
in the first few minutes
of the life of the universe,

657
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:27,439
transformed in the hearts of stars
or created in their fiery deaths.

658
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:29,519
And when you die,

659
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:32,719
those pieces will be
returned to the universe

660
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:36,239
in the endless cycle
of death and rebirth.

661
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:41,879
What a wonderful thing it is
to be a part of that universe.

662
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:45,919
And what a story, what a majestic story.
