1
00:00:45,793 --> 00:00:50,712
In the 1 960s, my generation
set out on a journey of change.

2
00:00:50,837 --> 00:00:53,478
Coming out of an atmosphere
of conformity,

3
00:00:53,601 --> 00:00:55,797
a new spirit began to appear.

4
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:58,598
One of the first signs
was a demonstration

5
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:01,879
organised by Berkeley students
in May of 1 960

6
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:05,401
against the House
Un-American Activities Committee.

7
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:09,006
What we are here to do
is to gather information

8
00:01:09,138 --> 00:01:13,499
as we are ordered to do
by an act of congress

9
00:01:13,622 --> 00:01:17,584
with respect to the general operation
of communist conspiracies.

10
00:01:17,706 --> 00:01:21,543
I'm not in the habit of being
intimidated and I won't start now.

11
00:01:21,671 --> 00:01:25,633
- Next question.
- What was your question?

12
00:01:25,755 --> 00:01:28,590
Are you a member
of the Communist Party?

13
00:01:29,199 --> 00:01:30,518
We came out to protest

14
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,795
because we were against HUAC's
suppression of political freedom.

15
00:01:34,925 --> 00:01:37,839
In the '50s,
HUAC created a climate of fear

16
00:01:37,969 --> 00:01:41,567
by putting people on trial
for their political beliefs.

17
00:01:41,692 --> 00:01:45,370
Any views left of centre
were labelled subversive.

18
00:01:45,497 --> 00:01:48,012
We refused to go back to McCarthyism.

19
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,613
If you think
that I am going to cooperate

20
00:01:51,743 --> 00:01:56,138
with this collection of Judases,

21
00:01:56,268 --> 00:02:00,663
of men who sit there in violation
of the United States Constitution,

22
00:02:00,793 --> 00:02:05,552
if you think I'll cooperate
with you in any way, you are insane.

23
00:02:05,678 --> 00:02:08,638
As witness after witness
denounced the committee,

24
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:10,674
the hearings grew stormy.

25
00:02:10,804 --> 00:02:14,196
The halls outside were filled
with students seeking admission.

26
00:02:14,328 --> 00:02:17,208
Suddenly the police
turned fire hoses full force

27
00:02:17,332 --> 00:02:20,007
on the demonstrators
inside the rotunda

28
00:02:20,134 --> 00:02:23,572
and then dragged them down the steps
of City Hall.

29
00:02:24,138 --> 00:02:26,369
It turned out to be
a political baptism

30
00:02:26,501 --> 00:02:30,099
that transformed fear
into determination.

31
00:02:30,946 --> 00:02:35,580
Something had changed.
After this, it would never be the same.

32
00:02:35,711 --> 00:02:37,942
The whole thing might have died down

33
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:41,626
except for the fact
that the committee made a film.

34
00:02:41,758 --> 00:02:45,036
It was called Operation Abolition.

35
00:02:45,161 --> 00:02:48,918
The film presented all of us...
I had been in these demonstrations.

36
00:02:49,045 --> 00:02:51,800
It presented all of us
as, somehow or other,

37
00:02:51,929 --> 00:02:54,684
engaged in a vast communist plot,

38
00:02:54,812 --> 00:02:58,011
not only to try to overthrow
the US government,

39
00:02:58,135 --> 00:03:01,926
but, worse, to abolish the House
Un-American Activities Committee.

40
00:03:08,307 --> 00:03:11,028
Operation Abolition.

41
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:14,827
This is what the communists
call their current drive

42
00:03:14,953 --> 00:03:18,915
to destroy the House Committee
on Un-American Activities

43
00:03:19,038 --> 00:03:22,716
and to render sterile
the security laws of our government.

44
00:03:23,323 --> 00:03:28,003
You will see revealed the long-time
classic communist tactic

45
00:03:28,127 --> 00:03:33,684
in which a relatively few
well-trained hard-core communist agents

46
00:03:34,295 --> 00:03:37,414
are able to incite non-communists

47
00:03:37,537 --> 00:03:41,328
to perform the dirty work
of the Communist Party.

48
00:03:41,462 --> 00:03:43,658
That movie was scheduled to be shown

49
00:03:43,785 --> 00:03:46,779
at the Harvard ROTC class.

50
00:03:46,908 --> 00:03:49,663
The ROTC had a class on campus.

51
00:03:49,792 --> 00:03:52,388
They were going to show
Operation Abolition.

52
00:03:52,514 --> 00:03:56,510
I'd heard all about Operation Abolition
and I was opposed to it.

53
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,874
So a bunch of us
decided to go to the class to protest.

54
00:04:01,004 --> 00:04:03,759
I remember very well
the way we protested.

55
00:04:03,886 --> 00:04:08,520
In the film, the students stand up
singing The Star-Spangled Banner

56
00:04:08,651 --> 00:04:13,092
to show HUAC don't pull
you're more American than us on us.

57
00:04:13,217 --> 00:04:17,179
The group of us stood up
in the ROTC class

58
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:21,741
to show that we're in solidarity
with the students in San Francisco.

59
00:04:31,316 --> 00:04:33,592
But what I really remember clearly

60
00:04:33,718 --> 00:04:37,475
is thinking, ''Wait a minute.
What am I doing here?''

61
00:04:37,603 --> 00:04:39,275
''Why aren't I there?''

62
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:46,007
And I checked this story out
with people who were at Berkeley

63
00:04:46,132 --> 00:04:48,693
and they told me
the exact same story,

64
00:04:48,815 --> 00:04:52,572
that Operation Abolition
had recruited them to Berkeley,

65
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:55,898
that they had seen it
round the country

66
00:04:56,022 --> 00:04:58,583
and gone in to see it as a protest

67
00:04:58,705 --> 00:05:02,017
and they'd thought,
''Wow! Let's go there.''

68
00:05:37,347 --> 00:05:39,623
The university's been called upon

69
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,188
to educate previously unimagined
numbers of students,

70
00:05:43,314 --> 00:05:46,992
to respond to the expanding claims
of national service,

71
00:05:47,118 --> 00:05:50,670
to merge its activities with industry
as never before.

72
00:05:51,563 --> 00:05:53,839
Characteristic of this transformation

73
00:05:53,965 --> 00:05:56,321
is the growth
of the knowledge industry

74
00:05:56,448 --> 00:06:00,444
which is permeating government
and business and to draw into it

75
00:06:00,573 --> 00:06:04,728
more and more people raised
to higher and higher levels of skill.

76
00:06:04,857 --> 00:06:08,375
The production, distribution
and consumption of knowledge

77
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:13,978
is said to account for 29 percent
of gross national product.

78
00:06:14,108 --> 00:06:16,225
Knowledge production is growing

79
00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:20,140
at about twice the rate
of the rest of the economy.

80
00:06:20,274 --> 00:06:24,429
What the railroads did for
the second half of the last century

81
00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:27,917
and the automobile
for the first half of this century

82
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:30,603
may be done for the second half
of this century

83
00:06:30,725 --> 00:06:32,397
by the knowledge industry

84
00:06:32,527 --> 00:06:37,241
and that is to service
the focal point for national growth.

85
00:06:37,373 --> 00:06:41,449
When we went to college, President
Kerr's vision became our reality.

86
00:06:41,577 --> 00:06:44,616
The University of California
was a knowledge factory,

87
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,620
the biggest public university
in America.

88
00:06:47,744 --> 00:06:50,544
It did research
for major corporations

89
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:53,581
and it ran the government's
nuclear weapons labs.

90
00:06:53,711 --> 00:06:57,468
Of the seven campuses,
Berkeley was the jewel in the crown

91
00:06:57,594 --> 00:06:59,950
with the most prestigious faculty.

92
00:07:00,077 --> 00:07:04,278
Within the sea of students, there was
little evidence of political life.

93
00:07:04,402 --> 00:07:08,444
But a few of us, who were interested
in politics, found each other

94
00:07:08,566 --> 00:07:11,446
and started an organisation
called SLATE.

95
00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:14,324
Some radical students
had gotten together

96
00:07:14,453 --> 00:07:19,577
to run a slate of candidates
in the student elections.

97
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:23,820
Although SLATE was not solely
about student elections,

98
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:27,142
the student elections
were used as a kind of platform

99
00:07:27,266 --> 00:07:30,021
through which we could educate
other students

100
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:33,189
and reach them
about the various issues

101
00:07:33,313 --> 00:07:35,111
that were alive during that time.

102
00:07:35,235 --> 00:07:38,388
Friends wrote me letters
of the discussions happening

103
00:07:38,518 --> 00:07:40,271
in the coffee shops of Berkeley.

104
00:07:40,401 --> 00:07:43,156
People were interested in politics
there.

105
00:07:43,284 --> 00:07:49,399
They'd already organised some little
student activist group on campus

106
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:52,683
that was starting to experiment
with doing things.

107
00:07:52,814 --> 00:07:56,172
I grew up in a small ethnic community
in Buffalo, New York.

108
00:07:56,298 --> 00:07:58,973
I knew I couldn't live
within its limitations.

109
00:07:59,101 --> 00:08:02,653
I had a couple of years at college.
I quit. I hitchhiked around.

110
00:08:02,785 --> 00:08:05,220
I ended up in San Francisco.
I got married.

111
00:08:05,348 --> 00:08:09,105
Then I went back to school.
I came to Berkeley really...

112
00:08:09,232 --> 00:08:13,513
I was looking for truth.
I was looking for meaning in my life.

113
00:08:13,636 --> 00:08:17,074
One of the most distressing tasks
of a university president

114
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,399
is to pretend
that the protest and outrage

115
00:08:20,524 --> 00:08:22,880
of each new generation of undergraduates

116
00:08:23,007 --> 00:08:25,283
is really fresh and meaningful.

117
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:30,010
In fact, it is one of the most
predictable controversies we know.

118
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:33,732
The participants go through a ritual
of hackneyed complaints

119
00:08:33,859 --> 00:08:35,851
almost as ancient as academe,

120
00:08:35,981 --> 00:08:38,656
while believing that what is said
is radical and new.

121
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:41,345
From the beginning,
the administration at Cal

122
00:08:41,466 --> 00:08:47,068
was trying to undermine
and prevent what we were trying to do.

123
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,424
They were very upset

124
00:08:49,556 --> 00:08:53,393
about the introduction
of what they called off-campus issues.

125
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,351
Anything to do with civil rights

126
00:08:55,482 --> 00:08:58,521
or with the testing
of nuclear weapons

127
00:08:58,645 --> 00:09:02,766
or apartheid in South Africa,
these were off-campus issues.

128
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:07,331
This was what we were attacking.
We were opposed to sandbox politics.

129
00:09:07,454 --> 00:09:10,129
The administration
started turning the screws.

130
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,727
They disenfranchised
the graduate students,

131
00:09:12,861 --> 00:09:15,376
because that was
a big block of the SLATE vote.

132
00:09:15,504 --> 00:09:18,498
Then they threw
the organisation off campus.

133
00:09:18,627 --> 00:09:20,858
There was a big outrage at that.

134
00:09:20,989 --> 00:09:22,308
We got reinstated.

135
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:26,029
So there was a growing community
of people

136
00:09:26,155 --> 00:09:30,710
who wanted to make
liberal or left or radical,

137
00:09:30,841 --> 00:09:35,282
however they thought about it,
politics legitimate in a country.

138
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:42,488
When we look at modern man,
we have to face the fact...

139
00:09:43,775 --> 00:09:45,528
..that modern man suffers

140
00:09:45,656 --> 00:09:48,934
from a kind of poverty
of the spirit...

141
00:09:50,621 --> 00:09:55,335
..which stands in glaring contrast

142
00:09:55,467 --> 00:09:58,506
to his scientific and technological
abundance.

143
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,987
We've learned to fly the air
like birds.

144
00:10:01,113 --> 00:10:04,073
We've learned to swim the seas
like fish.

145
00:10:04,196 --> 00:10:08,272
Yet we haven't learned to walk the earth
as brothers and sisters.

146
00:10:21,175 --> 00:10:23,930
More than any other cause,
the civil rights movement

147
00:10:24,058 --> 00:10:26,368
became the wellspring
of student activism

148
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,494
and inspired our entire generation.

149
00:10:29,624 --> 00:10:33,302
In 1 963, Berkeley students
began to band together

150
00:10:33,428 --> 00:10:37,709
with black activists to protest
discriminatory hiring practices

151
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:41,225
of Bay Area businesses.
We sat in at restaurants,

152
00:10:41,356 --> 00:10:44,270
supermarkets
and automobile showrooms.

153
00:10:45,161 --> 00:10:48,235
Our biggest challenge came
when we tried to secure jobs

154
00:10:48,364 --> 00:10:52,042
for blacks and other minorities
in the hotels of San Francisco.

155
00:10:52,168 --> 00:10:55,048
A picket line formed
around the Sheraton Palace,

156
00:10:55,171 --> 00:11:00,409
while negotiations with the Hotel
Owners Association took place inside.

157
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:04,054
It was getting to the point
where we were saying,

158
00:11:04,182 --> 00:11:06,903
''We are going to create
a confrontation.''

159
00:11:07,024 --> 00:11:11,305
''We're going to create a situation
that's intolerable

160
00:11:11,429 --> 00:11:13,990
and we're going to force you
to respond to it.''

161
00:11:14,112 --> 00:11:17,470
''We're willing to get arrested
in order to do it.''

162
00:11:17,596 --> 00:11:20,031
''And now the ball's in your court.''

163
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:31,366
All of us in this elegant lobby,
I can't convey to you the effect.

164
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,609
It was like the riffraff
coming to the White House.

165
00:11:36,376 --> 00:11:39,370
The real democratic masses
had moved in and taken over,

166
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,141
saying, ''No, you cannot continue

167
00:11:42,263 --> 00:11:44,698
to run this hotel
in this racist fashion.''

168
00:11:44,825 --> 00:11:48,980
''The world is being redefined.
Things cannot continue on that way.''

169
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,147
We just entered into discussions

170
00:11:51,272 --> 00:11:54,107
with the Sheraton Palace
for the last eight hours.

171
00:11:54,236 --> 00:11:56,228
We were given a seven-page document

172
00:11:56,358 --> 00:11:58,954
which was supposed
to summarise the agreement.

173
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,996
But there was a hitch, the Sheraton
Palace wasn't willing to sign.

174
00:12:29,994 --> 00:12:33,386
It was the first major victory
of anything l'd been involved in.

175
00:12:33,518 --> 00:12:35,430
The Sheraton Palace Hotel arrests

176
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,916
and convictions and trials
and so forth

177
00:12:38,042 --> 00:12:42,597
led to the first agreement, that
I knew of in the north, of its kind.

178
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:46,280
That was an agreement
between the entire hotel industry

179
00:12:46,412 --> 00:12:49,053
and the ad hoc committee
to end discrimination,

180
00:12:49,175 --> 00:12:52,055
to hire minority individuals

181
00:12:52,178 --> 00:12:56,094
in all levels of employment,
including management.

182
00:12:56,222 --> 00:12:58,293
It was very historic
and very elevating

183
00:12:58,425 --> 00:13:00,735
and it really pumped us all up
to think,

184
00:13:00,868 --> 00:13:04,864
''My God, we really could have
an effect on history.''

185
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:09,353
''We could have an effect on lives
of people we'd never know or meet.''

186
00:13:09,477 --> 00:13:14,191
It was simply by taking seriously
the words of the Constitution

187
00:13:14,322 --> 00:13:17,202
and the preamble
in The Declaration of lndependence

188
00:13:17,325 --> 00:13:20,877
and all that stuff that we believed
in with great vim and vigour.

189
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:23,650
Here we just saw it happen
and it worked.

190
00:13:23,772 --> 00:13:26,128
It was a very thrilling experience
for us,

191
00:13:26,255 --> 00:13:30,092
but the flip side of it is other people
saw it in a different light.

192
00:13:30,219 --> 00:13:34,614
That is, the business community
saw it as a threat,

193
00:13:34,744 --> 00:13:37,340
as something
that would cause them problems.

194
00:13:37,467 --> 00:13:40,586
The fact that 1 00 Berkeley students
were arrested,

195
00:13:40,711 --> 00:13:46,154
probably 500, 600, 800 Berkeley students
were involved in the thing,

196
00:13:46,276 --> 00:13:48,108
it was a portent of things to come.

197
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:51,119
Very quickly pressure
was put on the university.

198
00:13:51,242 --> 00:13:54,441
''You've got to stop this.''
The terms that were used were,

199
00:13:54,566 --> 00:13:59,086
''The university cannot be used
as a base for attacks on the community.''

200
00:14:00,452 --> 00:14:03,810
In the fall of the school year '64-'65,

201
00:14:03,936 --> 00:14:07,898
we returned to campus to find out
the tables on Bancroft and Telegraph

202
00:14:08,021 --> 00:14:12,860
which had historically been
the campus political activity lifeline

203
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:14,384
were banned.

204
00:14:14,507 --> 00:14:18,105
Tables have been permitted
out in front of Bancroft and Telegraph

205
00:14:18,231 --> 00:14:22,113
to distribute literature,

206
00:14:22,235 --> 00:14:26,026
including the ideas of policy
and advocating stands.

207
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,960
At this particular point,
we have been denied this.

208
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:32,840
We think,
whether or not this is true or not

209
00:14:32,967 --> 00:14:35,243
as far as why they're doing it,

210
00:14:35,369 --> 00:14:37,087
the effect of cutting this off

211
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:39,680
is to stop political activity
on this campus.

212
00:14:39,814 --> 00:14:43,492
We knew at the time that it was aimed
at the civil rights movement

213
00:14:43,619 --> 00:14:45,576
and at progressive organisations

214
00:14:45,701 --> 00:14:49,139
and at those interested in
the peace movement and civil rights.

215
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:50,822
Mainly civil rights.

216
00:14:50,946 --> 00:14:56,389
But by banning all of us,
they created an enormous reaction

217
00:14:56,513 --> 00:15:01,466
because they united a group of people
around the need to have those tables

218
00:15:01,598 --> 00:15:05,833
that couldn't have united themselves
under any other circumstances.

219
00:15:05,963 --> 00:15:09,116
We told them
they had to go back on the streets

220
00:15:09,246 --> 00:15:12,719
for this kind of activity.
They then took the position

221
00:15:12,851 --> 00:15:16,608
that, ''We want to undertake these
activities on campus property,''

222
00:15:16,734 --> 00:15:18,930
and we said, ''This is not possible.''

223
00:15:19,057 --> 00:15:22,769
When the university banned political
action at Bancroft and Telegraph,

224
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:25,416
they said it was the same
as the rest of the campus.

225
00:15:25,544 --> 00:15:28,299
We said, ''If it's the same
as the rest of the campus,

226
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,099
then we can do this anywhere.''

227
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:32,744
We decided to move our tables
to Sather Gate.

228
00:15:32,872 --> 00:15:35,752
Five students were sitting at tables
and deans came by

229
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:38,550
and said, ''If you don't leave,
we have to cite you.''

230
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:41,240
One of the students said,
''I'm sorry, sir,

231
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:44,196
my organisation
has not authorised me to leave.''

232
00:15:44,324 --> 00:15:45,962
And so he was cited.

233
00:15:46,086 --> 00:15:49,798
As soon as the student was cited,
the dean would cite the next student.

234
00:15:49,931 --> 00:15:51,763
Somebody would sit in their place.

235
00:15:51,893 --> 00:15:55,684
After they cited the five people,
they didn't want to be there all day,

236
00:15:55,816 --> 00:15:58,696
so the deans started leaving.
People said, ''Me, too!''

237
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:03,420
At three o'clock, 500 people
marched into Sproul Hall saying,

238
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:07,507
''Whatever you do to those people,
you've got to do to us.''

239
00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:11,021
If you don't stand up for your
freedom now, you're dead, guys.

240
00:16:13,956 --> 00:16:16,187
The deans wanted the students
who were cited

241
00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:17,798
to go into the deans' office.

242
00:16:17,921 --> 00:16:21,154
We said, ''We all did it.
You have to treat us all the same.''

243
00:16:21,284 --> 00:16:24,642
We were out in the halls
and nobody would go into the office.

244
00:16:24,768 --> 00:16:28,160
At about nine o'clock,
they announced that those five people

245
00:16:28,292 --> 00:16:31,013
plus three demonstration leaders
were suspended.

246
00:16:31,135 --> 00:16:34,254
The next morning, we really knew
it was going to happen.

247
00:16:34,378 --> 00:16:36,939
We set our tables up
in front of Sproul Hall.

248
00:16:37,061 --> 00:16:40,499
I guess I was one of the more noisy
people so a dean came up to me.

249
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,903
He asked me to identify myself
and I refused.

250
00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:47,911
He said if I didn't identify myself,
I would be arrested.

251
00:16:48,033 --> 00:16:51,711
It wasn't the first time that
I had been threatened with arrest.

252
00:16:51,837 --> 00:16:54,306
Two policemen took me under the arms.
I went limp.

253
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,511
They dragged me into the police car.

254
00:16:56,643 --> 00:17:00,161
Before I got into the police car,
it was surrounded with people.

255
00:17:02,248 --> 00:17:04,080
It was two minutes to 1 2.

256
00:17:04,211 --> 00:17:05,883
There's a commotion going on.

257
00:17:06,013 --> 00:17:08,813
Some people are joining in
or stopping to watch.

258
00:17:08,936 --> 00:17:11,053
This police car is going nowhere.

259
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,661
I just did
what any of my fellow students

260
00:17:14,782 --> 00:17:18,300
or fellows in other organisations
would've done.

261
00:17:18,426 --> 00:17:21,579
I was just singled out.
Chance selected me. l'm no martyr.

262
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:25,786
I couldn't understand why people were
prohibited from speaking in the plaza.

263
00:17:25,915 --> 00:17:29,593
And if this demonstration
around this police car

264
00:17:29,718 --> 00:17:34,079
was some way to indicate it was wrong,
it seemed like a good idea.

265
00:17:34,203 --> 00:17:37,356
I didn't like the idea
of seizing a police car very much

266
00:17:37,487 --> 00:17:40,083
but it was certainly a peaceful seizing.

267
00:17:40,209 --> 00:17:42,041
People began to speak.

268
00:17:42,172 --> 00:17:45,770
The only reason I took part in this
is because I like Cal very much.

269
00:17:45,896 --> 00:17:47,967
l'd like to see it better.

270
00:17:50,101 --> 00:17:53,858
And they'd stand on the car.
People were very careful about the car.

271
00:17:53,984 --> 00:17:58,105
People would take their shoes off
and gently climb up on the car.

272
00:17:58,229 --> 00:18:02,111
They moved from the hood of the car
up onto the roof of the car.

273
00:18:02,234 --> 00:18:05,786
Then the argument raged.
Are you with us or against us?

274
00:18:05,917 --> 00:18:09,070
I wasn't either. I was watching
and listening to speeches.

275
00:18:09,201 --> 00:18:12,275
There was an open microphone
on top of the police car.

276
00:18:12,405 --> 00:18:14,966
Anybody who wanted to speak
signed up on a list.

277
00:18:15,088 --> 00:18:18,241
They had three minutes
to say anything they wanted.

278
00:18:18,371 --> 00:18:22,003
Hour after hour,
people were getting up and orating.

279
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:25,209
It was like an explosion of ideas.

280
00:18:25,339 --> 00:18:27,057
Aristotle said,

281
00:18:27,181 --> 00:18:30,300
''lf you are not a citizen,
you are either a beast or a god!''

282
00:18:30,424 --> 00:18:33,020
Now, I ask you a very simple question...

283
00:18:34,748 --> 00:18:39,029
People start talking,
bringing in the Greek philosophers,

284
00:18:39,154 --> 00:18:42,387
the French Revolution,
talking about all the ideas,

285
00:18:42,517 --> 00:18:45,716
constitutional liberties,
as if they had meaning.

286
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,039
Late at night
some fraternity people came down.

287
00:18:49,164 --> 00:18:51,520
There was some confrontation.

288
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:55,325
They were heckling from the back
so someone said, ''Come on up.''

289
00:18:55,451 --> 00:18:59,606
They got one of the fraternity boys
to say his thing on the mic.

290
00:18:59,735 --> 00:19:01,214
By the time he got there,

291
00:19:01,337 --> 00:19:04,615
he forgot why he was against it
and his friends booed him.

292
00:19:04,741 --> 00:19:07,621
It really was a political awakening.

293
00:19:07,745 --> 00:19:10,625
There was a political issue
and we were all part of this.

294
00:19:10,748 --> 00:19:12,740
We weren't observing it
on television.

295
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:15,180
We were part of deciding
what would happen,

296
00:19:15,312 --> 00:19:17,987
as was the university administration.

297
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:21,349
No one from the university
administration came to speak.

298
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,201
No one came to present
any reasoned point of view

299
00:19:24,323 --> 00:19:26,201
about why the arrest had occurred

300
00:19:26,324 --> 00:19:31,038
or why the rules restricting
political speech were justifiable.

301
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,728
Nothing.

302
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:36,812
I ended up sitting in that police car
for 32 hours

303
00:19:36,936 --> 00:19:41,012
and, at the maximum time,
there were as many as 6,000 people

304
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,336
sitting down around the police car.

305
00:19:43,463 --> 00:19:46,343
At various points
when arrests were threatened,

306
00:19:46,466 --> 00:19:49,221
people didn't run away.
More people sat down.

307
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,706
People felt they had to sit down.

308
00:19:51,832 --> 00:19:54,267
People were saying,
''Join us. Join us.''

309
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:11,929
Mario and a delegation is off
negotiating with the administration.

310
00:20:12,054 --> 00:20:16,335
At the final minute, they arrive
and a settlement has been reached.

311
00:20:16,459 --> 00:20:18,735
May I please have a decision?

312
00:20:22,665 --> 00:20:24,337
What's the word now?

313
00:20:24,468 --> 00:20:27,746
- There's been an agreement signed.
- An agreement signed?

314
00:20:27,871 --> 00:20:31,662
Yes, by the student groups and by me,
as president of the university,

315
00:20:31,795 --> 00:20:33,991
which has several points to it.

316
00:20:34,118 --> 00:20:37,875
The first point
is that the student demonstrators

317
00:20:38,002 --> 00:20:43,843
shall desist
from their illegal actions,

318
00:20:43,968 --> 00:20:46,199
protesting university regulations.

319
00:20:46,331 --> 00:20:52,286
We've also agreed to set up
a committee to examine the rules.

320
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:55,173
The remarkable thing
about this entire situation

321
00:20:55,301 --> 00:20:59,058
is that there's been a coalition,
that I think is unusual in politics.

322
00:20:59,185 --> 00:21:04,309
A coalition from Youth for Goldwater
to the Young Socialist Alliance.

323
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:06,992
Usually these groups
don't speak together,

324
00:21:07,114 --> 00:21:11,156
let alone sit on the same table
and work out policies and platforms.

325
00:21:11,278 --> 00:21:15,433
l'm proud to say that American students
are united on one issue

326
00:21:15,563 --> 00:21:19,320
and that's the First Amendment
privileges of freedom of speech,

327
00:21:19,447 --> 00:21:22,999
the right to advocate and discuss
at any time, at any place,

328
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:26,842
as long as it doesn't disturb
classes and interfere with traffic.

329
00:21:26,975 --> 00:21:32,418
Our meetings lasted
1 0, 1 2, 1 5, 1 8 hours.

330
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:37,061
People slept at different times
during some of them and came back

331
00:21:37,186 --> 00:21:40,624
because we had two goals,
to figure out what to do

332
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,505
and to try to keep
this enormous coalition together.

333
00:21:43,633 --> 00:21:47,185
Understanding the power
of all of these groups

334
00:21:47,317 --> 00:21:50,072
moving in the same direction
around this issue.

335
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,595
That takes a long time because
you can't do it by a majority vote.

336
00:21:54,725 --> 00:21:57,480
The minority just says,
''OK, l'm gone.''

337
00:21:57,608 --> 00:22:00,807
It had to be by consensus.
People had to agree.

338
00:22:00,932 --> 00:22:02,206
And it took forever.

339
00:22:02,334 --> 00:22:06,376
We called it boring, disgusting,
time-consuming democracy.

340
00:22:07,098 --> 00:22:11,060
I remember one administrator
described the Free Speech Movement

341
00:22:11,183 --> 00:22:13,618
as a civil rights panty raid.

342
00:22:13,746 --> 00:22:16,022
That's not such a dumb description.

343
00:22:16,148 --> 00:22:19,301
He did see kids having a good time.
It was very exciting.

344
00:22:19,432 --> 00:22:23,223
Instead of being about panties,
it's about civil rights.

345
00:22:23,356 --> 00:22:25,473
But what he failed to see

346
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:29,356
is that there was a real underlying
seriousness to this.

347
00:22:29,482 --> 00:22:32,362
There was a tremendous
sense of community.

348
00:22:32,486 --> 00:22:36,243
It's as if all these students
had been waiting to work together

349
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:37,883
and suddenly they did it.

350
00:22:38,012 --> 00:22:39,969
Six weeks ago, they promised us

351
00:22:40,095 --> 00:22:43,647
that they would negotiate
on their regulations of free speech.

352
00:22:43,778 --> 00:22:47,694
Yes, they negotiated. They have
blocked every attempt we have made.

353
00:22:47,823 --> 00:22:49,701
If they refuse to come to a stand,

354
00:22:49,825 --> 00:22:53,058
we will also consider negotiations
as being broken by them.

355
00:22:53,189 --> 00:22:55,306
However we will continue to try

356
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:59,062
and get them to come to a vote
or take a stand or make a decision.

357
00:22:59,195 --> 00:23:02,155
As Mario Savio
would talk about a meeting

358
00:23:02,278 --> 00:23:04,235
and tell what happened in the meeting

359
00:23:04,361 --> 00:23:07,400
and explain the positions
taken by the administration

360
00:23:07,524 --> 00:23:11,076
and, from what I could tell, would
tell exactly what had gone on,...

361
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:18,209
..l would then contrast that with
the administration's explanation.

362
00:23:18,336 --> 00:23:21,375
Muffled, guarded.

363
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,018
The administration would not explain
what had happened.

364
00:23:25,143 --> 00:23:26,896
They wouldn't tell the truth.

365
00:23:27,025 --> 00:23:29,335
A lot of people became very upset

366
00:23:29,468 --> 00:23:32,826
about what administration spokesmen
would say was going on

367
00:23:32,952 --> 00:23:35,023
when they knew it wasn't true.

368
00:23:35,153 --> 00:23:36,472
What you have there

369
00:23:36,595 --> 00:23:41,468
are a few of these rather bearded,
unwashed characters

370
00:23:41,601 --> 00:23:44,481
with sandals and long hair

371
00:23:44,604 --> 00:23:49,124
who normally would be regarded
tolerantly as a lunatic fringe

372
00:23:49,249 --> 00:23:53,165
which you put up with
but you do not necessarily encourage.

373
00:23:53,293 --> 00:23:57,209
In effect, the campus has been
turned over to these characters.

374
00:23:57,338 --> 00:24:01,095
Somewhere in the process of the FSM,
for the very first time

375
00:24:01,222 --> 00:24:06,699
the young, privileged,
affluent children of the culture

376
00:24:06,828 --> 00:24:10,710
began to see themselves
as an oppressed class.

377
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:13,268
It was an astounding perception

378
00:24:13,396 --> 00:24:16,948
because here we were
at the height of the privileged,

379
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:19,435
the best students
at the best multiversity

380
00:24:19,562 --> 00:24:21,918
destined to be the managers
of the society.

381
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:24,002
In the middle of this,

382
00:24:24,127 --> 00:24:27,087
we turned around
and looked at our education and said,

383
00:24:27,211 --> 00:24:30,523
''Wait a minute.
Somehow the best is the worst.''

384
00:24:30,654 --> 00:24:32,930
It put us out of touch
with the society.

385
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:37,177
It severed technology from values,
the intellect from the heart.

386
00:24:37,301 --> 00:24:40,579
For many people, this was
the only educational activity

387
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:44,302
that we were involved in
that was deeply meaningful.

388
00:25:49,739 --> 00:25:52,174
In late November, it became clear

389
00:25:52,302 --> 00:25:54,977
that the administration
had finally figured out

390
00:25:55,105 --> 00:25:57,780
how to break us apart as a coalition.

391
00:25:57,909 --> 00:26:00,823
That was they said
we could have our tables back.

392
00:26:00,951 --> 00:26:02,829
We could do the things we wanted to

393
00:26:02,954 --> 00:26:05,515
but we couldn't advocate
unlawful activity,

394
00:26:05,637 --> 00:26:09,918
less we'd still be liable for
discipline as students on the campus.

395
00:26:10,042 --> 00:26:11,999
It was very clear to us

396
00:26:12,124 --> 00:26:15,482
that the only groups that last part
of the rule were aimed at

397
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:19,159
were those who used civil disobedience
in their strategies.

398
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:22,046
That meant the left
and the civil rights movement.

399
00:26:22,175 --> 00:26:23,574
We felt quite defeated.

400
00:26:23,697 --> 00:26:25,973
This position on the question
of advocacy,

401
00:26:26,098 --> 00:26:29,297
which the president recommended
and the regents approved,

402
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:32,860
is far severer than any recommended
by any faculty committee

403
00:26:32,986 --> 00:26:36,139
and, of course, is totally unacceptable
to the students.

404
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:39,902
It constitutes, in fact,
prior restraint on speech,

405
00:26:40,033 --> 00:26:42,070
on political expression on campus.

406
00:26:42,196 --> 00:26:44,631
So, you've lost a lot of ground?

407
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:48,516
Well, it's very hard to say.

408
00:26:48,643 --> 00:26:51,876
Fortunately, the university
committed another atrocity.

409
00:26:52,007 --> 00:26:56,527
They could not end this whole incident
without punishing somebody

410
00:26:56,652 --> 00:27:00,443
and teaching a lesson
that this should never again happen.

411
00:27:00,576 --> 00:27:03,615
So when students got back
after Thanksgiving break,

412
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:06,814
they found out that the eight people
originally cited

413
00:27:06,943 --> 00:27:10,621
had received letters saying
that disciplinary proceedings

414
00:27:10,747 --> 00:27:13,388
leading to expulsion
had begun against them.

415
00:27:14,311 --> 00:27:17,623
So here we are.
Four students are getting the axe,

416
00:27:17,755 --> 00:27:21,910
six organisations are getting the axe
for standing up this semester

417
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:24,395
and for fighting for these things.

418
00:27:24,522 --> 00:27:29,441
They're getting the axe not for what
they did but for what we have done.

419
00:27:29,568 --> 00:27:32,403
They spoke for us.
They were part of us.

420
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:35,205
They have been singled out
and will be chopped off.

421
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:37,131
We were told the following.

422
00:27:37,256 --> 00:27:42,574
If Kerr tried to get something
more liberal out of the regents,

423
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:45,662
why didn't he make a public statement
to that effect?

424
00:27:45,785 --> 00:27:47,184
The answer we received

425
00:27:47,306 --> 00:27:50,106
from a well-meaning liberal
was the following.

426
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:54,351
He said, ''Would you ever imagine
the manager of a firm

427
00:27:54,475 --> 00:27:58,312
making a statement publicly
in opposition to his directors?''

428
00:27:58,438 --> 00:28:00,395
That's the answer.

429
00:28:00,521 --> 00:28:03,754
I ask you to consider
if this is a firm

430
00:28:03,885 --> 00:28:06,354
and if the regents are the directors

431
00:28:06,488 --> 00:28:08,923
and if President Kerr is the manager,

432
00:28:09,051 --> 00:28:12,524
then, I tell you something,
the faculty are a bunch of employees

433
00:28:12,654 --> 00:28:15,807
and we're the raw materials,
but we're raw materials

434
00:28:15,938 --> 00:28:18,898
that don't mean
to have any process upon us,

435
00:28:19,021 --> 00:28:20,899
don't mean to be made into a product,

436
00:28:21,023 --> 00:28:25,976
don't mean to end up being bought
by some clients of the university,

437
00:28:26,108 --> 00:28:29,865
be they the government, industry,
organised labour, be they anyone.

438
00:28:29,993 --> 00:28:31,108
We're human beings.

439
00:28:34,238 --> 00:28:39,442
There's a time when the operation
of the machine becomes so odious,

440
00:28:39,563 --> 00:28:43,081
makes you so sick at heart
that you can't take part.

441
00:28:43,207 --> 00:28:45,483
You can't even passively take part.

442
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:49,208
You've got to put your bodies
upon the gears and upon the wheels,

443
00:28:49,334 --> 00:28:53,091
upon the levers, upon the apparatus
and you've got to make it stop

444
00:28:53,218 --> 00:28:56,212
and you've got to indicate
to the people who run it

445
00:28:56,341 --> 00:28:57,740
that unless you're free,

446
00:28:57,863 --> 00:29:00,902
the machine will be prevented
from working at all.

447
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:43,021
How could you not
go into Sproul Hall?

448
00:29:43,153 --> 00:29:46,511
Everybody was going into Sproul Hall.
It was a...

449
00:29:48,678 --> 00:29:51,193
It was a...

450
00:29:52,282 --> 00:29:54,717
What other alternative did you have

451
00:29:54,845 --> 00:29:58,157
to say that you weren't happy
with the way things were going?

452
00:29:58,288 --> 00:30:01,886
I hesitated for about two seconds
and I thought...

453
00:30:02,012 --> 00:30:06,167
I got a picture of my husband's face
and I thought,

454
00:30:06,297 --> 00:30:08,732
''What is this going to do?''

455
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:12,492
''What is it going to do to my career,
to my life?''

456
00:30:12,624 --> 00:30:16,016
Then I just said, ''To hell with it,
I don't care what it does.''

457
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:18,789
''This is my chance to do something.''

458
00:30:19,832 --> 00:30:24,705
The fourth, third and second floors
are filled. Stay downstairs.

459
00:30:24,837 --> 00:30:29,835
Members of the Bay Area Civil Rights
Movement in the stairwell over there.

460
00:30:43,537 --> 00:30:47,294
People were dancing in the hallways.
People were studying.

461
00:30:47,422 --> 00:30:49,983
People were just sitting
on the cold floors,

462
00:30:50,104 --> 00:30:52,859
wandering around,
talking with each other.

463
00:30:53,748 --> 00:30:58,621
It was chaos and confusion
and it was sort of like a party

464
00:30:58,754 --> 00:31:00,950
and it went on and on and on.

465
00:31:01,077 --> 00:31:04,993
Finally, the police decided
that if you wanted to go out,

466
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,034
you could go out,
but you couldn't get back in.

467
00:31:09,606 --> 00:31:11,563
I debated about this for...

468
00:31:11,688 --> 00:31:15,240
I don't think I was in the position
of deciding to make witness

469
00:31:15,372 --> 00:31:18,571
or not make witness,
a great moral decision.

470
00:31:18,695 --> 00:31:23,933
It was getting to be dinnertime.
It was getting in or not getting in.

471
00:31:24,061 --> 00:31:27,135
I had no idea this was going
to go on for a long time.

472
00:31:27,265 --> 00:31:28,664
When I came back,

473
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:31,985
people were climbing with ropes
up the front of Sproul Hall.

474
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:36,794
It was clear that something was
happening but it wasn't clear what.

475
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:40,468
May I have your attention, please?

476
00:31:42,801 --> 00:31:48,722
I am Dr Edward Strong,
chancellor of the Berkeley campus.

477
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:53,448
I have an announcement.

478
00:31:54,895 --> 00:31:59,130
This assemblage
has developed to such a point

479
00:31:59,259 --> 00:32:02,014
that the purpose
and work of the university

480
00:32:02,142 --> 00:32:05,375
have been materially impaired.

481
00:32:16,278 --> 00:32:18,554
Please go.

482
00:32:18,681 --> 00:32:21,436
I wanted to run.
My impulse was to run.

483
00:32:21,563 --> 00:32:25,320
I was hanging on to the people next
to me to keep myself from jumping up.

484
00:32:25,447 --> 00:32:28,122
Then something really neat happened.

485
00:32:28,251 --> 00:32:35,653
That was... Art Goldberg
was the leader of our floor.

486
00:32:35,778 --> 00:32:38,213
He was in charge of us.
He was standing there.

487
00:32:38,341 --> 00:32:40,298
He heard they were coming up

488
00:32:40,424 --> 00:32:43,384
so he was giving us a speech
on what you do,

489
00:32:43,507 --> 00:32:44,860
how you go limp.

490
00:32:44,989 --> 00:32:48,063
He said, ''When the cops come at you,
don't fight them.''

491
00:32:48,192 --> 00:32:49,910
''You just want to go limp.''

492
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:53,187
As he's saying this,
the cops are coming at him.

493
00:32:53,318 --> 00:32:55,355
He talked all the way down
to the floor.

494
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,315
I know this because I was looking
between their legs.

495
00:32:58,444 --> 00:33:00,561
It was really an inspiration.

496
00:33:00,686 --> 00:33:04,364
I said, ''lf he can do that,
that's what l'm going to try to do.''

497
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:06,208
When they got to me, they said,

498
00:33:06,332 --> 00:33:09,167
''Do you want to walk out like a lady
or get dragged out?''

499
00:33:09,295 --> 00:33:11,685
I said, ''l want to get dragged out
like a lady.''

500
00:33:42,411 --> 00:33:46,966
With the arrests came
a massive collapse of the authority

501
00:33:47,096 --> 00:33:48,849
of the campus administration.

502
00:33:48,978 --> 00:33:52,735
Now, they made a desperate attempt
to regain that authority

503
00:33:52,863 --> 00:33:56,336
in a big meeting
at the Greek Theater.

504
00:33:56,466 --> 00:34:00,223
The departmental chairmen believe
that the acts of civil disobedience

505
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:02,865
on December 2nd and 3rd
were unwarranted

506
00:34:02,993 --> 00:34:06,305
and that they obstruct rational
and fair consideration

507
00:34:06,437 --> 00:34:09,112
of the grievances
brought forward by the students.

508
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,792
There are a small number
of individuals, I regret to say,

509
00:34:12,924 --> 00:34:17,683
who are interested in fomenting
a crisis merely for the sake of crisis.

510
00:34:19,091 --> 00:34:23,566
They hope that continuing chaos
will bring about a total revolution

511
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:26,894
and their own particular concept
of utopia.

512
00:34:32,786 --> 00:34:36,668
The university supports
the powers of persuasion

513
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:38,941
against the use of force,

514
00:34:39,072 --> 00:34:43,752
the constructive act
as against the destructive blow,

515
00:34:43,878 --> 00:34:48,876
respect for the rights of others,
opposition to passion and hate,

516
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:53,523
the reasoned argument
as against the simplistic slogan.

517
00:34:53,648 --> 00:34:57,929
The academic world
and the people of this state

518
00:34:58,053 --> 00:35:01,605
expect of us conduct commensurate

519
00:35:01,736 --> 00:35:05,698
with our past achievements
and our high capacities.

520
00:35:05,821 --> 00:35:09,703
We should expect no less of ourselves.
Thank you.

521
00:35:19,636 --> 00:35:21,867
We want Mario!

522
00:35:26,243 --> 00:35:28,553
The police have got Mario.

523
00:35:28,686 --> 00:35:31,121
They are pulling him away...

524
00:35:31,249 --> 00:35:34,607
The police have pulled Mario away
from the speaker stand.

525
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:44,898
He tried to exercise free speech.

526
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:48,302
When he stood up here,
the police took him away.

527
00:35:48,428 --> 00:35:51,740
That shows the entire process
that's going on campus.

528
00:35:51,872 --> 00:35:53,909
We, of course, had no notion

529
00:35:54,033 --> 00:35:57,995
that Mr Savio was going to try to
speak at the end of this meeting.

530
00:35:58,118 --> 00:36:00,474
He asked... Just a moment.

531
00:36:00,601 --> 00:36:04,517
Just a moment. He asked...

532
00:36:05,365 --> 00:36:08,518
- Just a moment.
- Just let him speak.

533
00:36:08,649 --> 00:36:10,082
He asked...

534
00:36:12,093 --> 00:36:14,848
He asked me at the beginning
of the meeting

535
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:18,209
whether he would be allowed
to speak at this meeting.

536
00:36:18,339 --> 00:36:19,488
I said he would not

537
00:36:19,621 --> 00:36:22,854
because this was a structured meeting,
not an open forum,

538
00:36:22,985 --> 00:36:26,138
and we had a programme
which had been approved.

539
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:28,180
They're hypocrites and bastards.

540
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:32,387
Even if the Greek Theater
had gone exactly according to plan,

541
00:36:32,515 --> 00:36:34,472
it still would've been a flop.

542
00:36:34,597 --> 00:36:37,716
But it was worse than a flop,
it was a fiasco,

543
00:36:37,841 --> 00:36:40,596
and there was a kind of pandemonium
on the campus.

544
00:36:40,724 --> 00:36:43,159
There was a power vacuum.

545
00:36:43,287 --> 00:36:45,722
Who the hell was in charge?
Nobody knew.

546
00:36:45,849 --> 00:36:48,410
A bunch of us drafted a resolution.

547
00:36:48,532 --> 00:36:52,210
We took that resolution
into the academic senate

548
00:36:52,337 --> 00:36:54,772
and it passed by over seven to one.

549
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,461
The overwhelming majority of the faculty

550
00:36:57,583 --> 00:37:01,784
had come down firmly
on the side of free speech.

551
00:37:01,907 --> 00:37:04,422
So when the faculty marched out

552
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:08,148
into this cheering mob of students,

553
00:37:08,274 --> 00:37:11,234
we knew that was it,
that was victory.

554
00:37:11,357 --> 00:37:16,037
We had achieved everything
we had set out to achieve in the FSM.

555
00:37:16,162 --> 00:37:19,076
Student rallies
at the University of California

556
00:37:19,206 --> 00:37:22,166
over the past two months
have become commonplace.

557
00:37:22,289 --> 00:37:27,652
But today's rally in front of Sproul
Hall has taken on a different tone.

558
00:37:27,775 --> 00:37:30,165
Several thousand students
have gathered

559
00:37:30,298 --> 00:37:33,337
for what has been billed
as a victory celebration,

560
00:37:33,461 --> 00:37:35,930
a victory the students feel is assured

561
00:37:36,064 --> 00:37:40,219
as a result of yesterday's action
by the academic senate.

562
00:37:40,348 --> 00:37:45,632
We're asking that there be
no restrictions

563
00:37:45,754 --> 00:37:50,912
on the content of speech,
save those provided by the courts.

564
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,432
That's an enormous amount of freedom.

565
00:37:55,525 --> 00:38:01,321
People can say things
within that area of freedom

566
00:38:01,452 --> 00:38:03,489
which are not responsible.

567
00:38:03,613 --> 00:38:07,529
Now, that's... We've finally
gotten into a position

568
00:38:07,658 --> 00:38:10,458
where we have to consider
being responsible

569
00:38:10,581 --> 00:38:14,942
because now we have the freedom
within which to be responsible.

570
00:38:15,066 --> 00:38:19,028
l'd like to say
that at this time l'm confident...

571
00:38:19,871 --> 00:38:22,432
l'm confident that the students

572
00:38:22,554 --> 00:38:25,753
and the faculty
in the University of California

573
00:38:25,878 --> 00:38:28,713
will exercise their freedom

574
00:38:28,841 --> 00:38:33,076
with the same responsibility
they've shown in winning their freedom.

575
00:38:35,007 --> 00:38:39,322
People thought, ''This is it.
This is day one of a new era.''

576
00:38:39,453 --> 00:38:42,447
We're going to have
a different university.

577
00:38:42,576 --> 00:38:45,695
We can re-plan the whole
structure of the university.

578
00:38:45,819 --> 00:38:49,497
If we want, we can have the
administrators sweeping sidewalks.

579
00:38:49,623 --> 00:38:52,092
That was a popular slogan
in those days.

580
00:38:52,226 --> 00:38:55,265
We can have a different
conception of education.

581
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:58,623
Worse yet, we attracted to Berkeley

582
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:02,385
the worst collection
of kooks and nuts you've ever seen.

583
00:39:02,517 --> 00:39:04,349
Everybody saw this on television

584
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,915
and they had
a distorted conception of it.

585
00:39:07,043 --> 00:39:11,085
They thought what you do is you go to
Berkeley, riot and have a great time.

586
00:39:11,206 --> 00:39:15,168
lt's one big political,
sexual, drug feast.

587
00:39:15,291 --> 00:39:17,726
Didn't Ronald Reagan
himself say

588
00:39:17,854 --> 00:39:20,893
that it was all drugs and sex
and radical politics?

589
00:39:21,018 --> 00:39:24,012
They had this absurd conception
of what was going on.

590
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:27,020
The media exaggerated it
in a certain way.

591
00:39:27,144 --> 00:39:31,220
We had created a set of expectations
that were really not satisfiable.

592
00:39:31,349 --> 00:39:34,981
What irritated me most in the stuff
that came out about that period

593
00:39:35,113 --> 00:39:38,425
was the description of us
as alienated and cynical.

594
00:39:38,556 --> 00:39:41,311
We were the absolute antithesis
of that.

595
00:39:41,439 --> 00:39:43,590
We were so committed and so involved,

596
00:39:43,722 --> 00:39:46,761
we risked our careers,
our jobs, our education

597
00:39:46,886 --> 00:39:51,167
and we did it because
we were so tied into this system,

598
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:53,327
to this country, to this culture.

599
00:39:53,452 --> 00:39:55,603
We believed in it so much

600
00:39:55,735 --> 00:39:58,045
that we were willing
to take those risks

601
00:39:58,178 --> 00:40:00,534
at a time when it wasn't
popular to do so.

602
00:40:00,661 --> 00:40:04,976
l'd never realised people would lie
to maintain their positions of power.

603
00:40:05,705 --> 00:40:07,458
Then I saw it.

604
00:40:07,588 --> 00:40:11,550
I don't think people were evil to lie,
but they did it.

605
00:40:11,672 --> 00:40:16,192
They altered the way things were
to maintain their positions of power

606
00:40:16,317 --> 00:40:18,786
and they did it in a way
that was wrong.

607
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:22,677
And then I saw that,
then I saw that everywhere.

608
00:40:22,804 --> 00:40:26,846
I saw that in the structures
of political power in Oakland.

609
00:40:26,969 --> 00:40:30,521
I saw that in the structures
of political power in the South.

610
00:40:30,652 --> 00:40:33,646
I began to see
that the mechanisms

611
00:40:33,776 --> 00:40:36,895
that the Free Speech Movement
was attempting to change

612
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,455
were mechanisms
that operated everywhere.

613
00:40:39,583 --> 00:40:42,144
I was at a rally
where Mario was speaking.

614
00:40:42,265 --> 00:40:43,744
He was the speaker.

615
00:40:43,867 --> 00:40:46,906
It was some kind of wrap-up rally.

616
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:50,263
Maybe it was right after the trial
or something like that.

617
00:40:50,394 --> 00:40:53,388
It was sort of like,
''Well, the FSM is over.''

618
00:40:53,518 --> 00:40:56,478
''We've got it all.
That's all settled.''

619
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,958
My feeling was, ''OK, that's settled.
I can go on with my life.''

620
00:41:00,084 --> 00:41:03,841
I was even walking away from
the rally before Mario was finished.

621
00:41:03,969 --> 00:41:08,808
I have this very clear memory
of his voice ringing out

622
00:41:08,934 --> 00:41:10,891
as l'm leaving Sproul Plaza.

623
00:41:11,016 --> 00:41:15,377
He's saying, ''Don't walk away
because we've still got a war to stop.''

624
00:41:15,501 --> 00:41:20,739
I just looked around real startled
and I thought, ''War? What war?''

625
00:41:20,868 --> 00:41:23,623
Then it turned out
that it was the Vietnam War.

626
00:41:24,511 --> 00:41:29,795
If I can have your help,
if I can have your hand,

627
00:41:29,917 --> 00:41:34,631
if I can have your heart,
if I can have your prayers...

628
00:41:34,762 --> 00:41:37,801
If the good Lord is willing,
I will continue

629
00:41:37,925 --> 00:41:42,046
to try to lead this nation
and this world to peace.

630
00:42:13,084 --> 00:42:16,841
Victory in our struggle
for civil rights and free speech

631
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:20,599
made us confident that we could
change the course of history.

632
00:42:21,453 --> 00:42:23,410
Then we learned about Vietnam

633
00:42:23,535 --> 00:42:26,574
and stopping the war
became our consuming cause.

634
00:42:30,502 --> 00:42:33,780
The first large activity
in opposition to the Vietnam War

635
00:42:33,906 --> 00:42:36,467
was Vietnam Day in May 1 965.

636
00:42:36,589 --> 00:42:40,551
There was a parade of speakers
that, one after another,

637
00:42:40,673 --> 00:42:43,906
started telling us
something that we really didn't know

638
00:42:44,037 --> 00:42:47,475
which was what our country
was doing in Vietnam.

639
00:42:47,601 --> 00:42:51,313
Most of us grew up thinking
that that United States

640
00:42:51,445 --> 00:42:54,200
was a great and humble nation

641
00:42:54,328 --> 00:42:59,566
that involved itself in the affairs
of other countries reluctantly

642
00:42:59,694 --> 00:43:02,608
as a last and final resort.

643
00:43:02,737 --> 00:43:05,811
But now, the war in Vietnam

644
00:43:05,941 --> 00:43:08,616
has provided
the incredibly sharp razor

645
00:43:08,743 --> 00:43:12,705
that has finally separated thousands
and thousands of people

646
00:43:12,828 --> 00:43:16,983
from their illusions
about the morality and integrity

647
00:43:17,113 --> 00:43:20,995
of this country's purposes
internationally.

648
00:43:21,117 --> 00:43:25,352
Never again will the self-righteous
saccharine moralism

649
00:43:25,482 --> 00:43:28,043
of promising a billion dollars
of economic aid

650
00:43:28,165 --> 00:43:32,127
while we spend billions and billions
of dollars to destroy them,

651
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:36,485
never again will that moralism
have the power to persuade people

652
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:40,166
of the essential decency
of this country's aims.

653
00:43:40,298 --> 00:43:42,654
What kind of a system is it

654
00:43:42,781 --> 00:43:48,782
that allows decent men, good men,
to make the decisions

655
00:43:48,907 --> 00:43:52,539
that have led to the thousands
and thousands of deaths

656
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:54,549
that have happened in Vietnam?

657
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:59,274
What kind of a system is it
that justifies the United States

658
00:43:59,398 --> 00:44:02,631
in seizing the destinies
of other people

659
00:44:02,762 --> 00:44:06,200
and using them callously
for our own ends?

660
00:44:06,326 --> 00:44:09,001
We must name that system

661
00:44:09,129 --> 00:44:11,690
and we must change it and control it,

662
00:44:11,812 --> 00:44:14,043
else it will destroy us.

663
00:44:18,299 --> 00:44:20,256
The war escalated rapidly.

664
00:44:20,381 --> 00:44:24,263
Every month another 20,000 soldiers
shipped out to Vietnam.

665
00:44:24,386 --> 00:44:26,821
Many of them came through Berkeley.

666
00:44:26,948 --> 00:44:29,783
Some of us decided to stop the trains.

667
00:44:30,833 --> 00:44:34,988
I was walking next to a woman
and she told me that she was a Buddhist

668
00:44:35,117 --> 00:44:38,077
and that she had been pulled into
stopping the war

669
00:44:38,201 --> 00:44:40,591
by the immolations of the priests.

670
00:44:40,723 --> 00:44:43,683
She said she was going
to sit on the tracks

671
00:44:43,807 --> 00:44:46,083
and so I said, ''OK, I will, too.''

672
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:50,927
As the train came around the bend,
I thought, ''lt has to slow down.''

673
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:52,808
But it sped up.

674
00:44:52,936 --> 00:44:56,328
Then as it got closer to us,
it began shooting out steam.

675
00:44:59,784 --> 00:45:03,017
As the steam hit me,
I jumped out of the steam.

676
00:45:03,148 --> 00:45:05,663
I looked at the woman
l'd been talking to

677
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:09,832
and she was sitting in a full lotus
position in the middle of the tracks.

678
00:45:09,955 --> 00:45:14,316
As the train went rushing by,
I thought she was under it.

679
00:45:15,281 --> 00:45:19,243
When the train got past, I expected
to see a big pile of blood.

680
00:45:19,365 --> 00:45:22,200
There was nothing.
She had just disappeared.

681
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:28,371
A few days later, the woman walked
into the museum where I was working,

682
00:45:28,495 --> 00:45:31,534
leading a big group of children
on a tour.

683
00:45:31,658 --> 00:45:36,178
I said, ''What happened?
What did you do?''

684
00:45:36,303 --> 00:45:38,864
She said,
''The plain-clothes policeman

685
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:41,946
snatched me off the track
before the train got there.''

686
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:44,426
I said,
''Were you going to stay there?''

687
00:45:44,552 --> 00:45:47,432
''Were you going to let the train
kill you?''

688
00:45:47,555 --> 00:45:50,788
She said, ''Yes, I was going to,
but that isn't what happened

689
00:45:50,919 --> 00:45:54,357
so now l'm here taking these children
through the museum.''

690
00:45:54,483 --> 00:45:57,956
And it really struck me.
It really hit my heart

691
00:45:58,087 --> 00:46:01,844
that here was a person
who was ready to give her life

692
00:46:01,971 --> 00:46:04,008
to try to stop the war.

693
00:46:04,134 --> 00:46:07,526
That's when it came through to me
just how important it was.

694
00:46:07,658 --> 00:46:10,811
What we have to do
is get rid of this tactical point.

695
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:14,093
In the fall of '65,
the Vietnam Day Committee

696
00:46:14,224 --> 00:46:16,500
organised its first anti-war march.

697
00:46:16,627 --> 00:46:19,587
The destination
was the Oakland army terminal.

698
00:46:19,711 --> 00:46:23,627
The City of Oakland refused a permit.
The VDC voted to march anyway.

699
00:46:23,754 --> 00:46:27,386
All in favour of the motion
to march regardless of permit?

700
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:30,799
All opposed?

701
00:46:32,444 --> 00:46:33,877
The Vietnam Day Committee

702
00:46:34,006 --> 00:46:36,806
intends to have a peaceful march
through Oakland.

703
00:46:36,929 --> 00:46:39,205
We intend no civil disobedience.

704
00:46:39,331 --> 00:46:43,373
We do not intend to break any laws.
We've made this point quite clear.

705
00:46:43,496 --> 00:46:46,456
We think it's incredible
that the Oakland authorities

706
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:49,415
have denied us a permit
for this march.

707
00:46:49,543 --> 00:46:52,298
Our policy is the following.

708
00:46:52,425 --> 00:46:55,385
We are going to march
down Telegraph Avenue.

709
00:46:55,509 --> 00:46:57,944
We hear that a cordon

710
00:46:58,072 --> 00:47:02,627
is very likely to be formed
right past the Oakland City line.

711
00:47:02,757 --> 00:47:05,113
It is a very dangerous situation.

712
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:08,199
We can create a great peace movement
or destroy it.

713
00:47:08,323 --> 00:47:10,440
We urge your cooperation.

714
00:47:11,406 --> 00:47:15,561
We had a problem. The police had put up
a barricade at the Oakland line.

715
00:47:15,691 --> 00:47:17,967
We had to deal
with what we were going to do

716
00:47:18,093 --> 00:47:20,289
when the march got to that point.

717
00:47:20,416 --> 00:47:23,774
Some of us ran ahead to see
if we could bluff our way through.

718
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:27,019
It was clear it was going
to be a bloody situation.

719
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:29,659
I just decided that we were turning.

720
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:38,423
l, basically, was the person
who made that decision.

721
00:47:38,556 --> 00:47:43,395
For years afterwards,
I got great degrees of shit for it.

722
00:47:43,521 --> 00:47:45,638
Never knew if I did right or wrong.

723
00:47:45,763 --> 00:47:48,438
I still don't know
if it was the right decision.

724
00:47:57,576 --> 00:48:01,937
The next day, a larger march made a
second attempt to cross into Oakland.

725
00:48:02,061 --> 00:48:04,622
Once again,
a police cordon was waiting.

726
00:48:04,744 --> 00:48:08,342
This time the marchers faced
another obstacle. Hell's Angels.

727
00:48:08,469 --> 00:48:10,586
Why don't you people go home?

728
00:48:16,197 --> 00:48:17,995
Get out of here!

729
00:48:23,284 --> 00:48:25,719
Back off. Back off.

730
00:48:36,298 --> 00:48:38,654
Each attempt to stop
the anti-war movement

731
00:48:38,781 --> 00:48:40,738
seemed to make our numbers grow.

732
00:48:40,863 --> 00:48:44,221
A month later, a third march,
far greater than the first two,

733
00:48:44,347 --> 00:48:46,384
finally made it into Oakland.

734
00:49:17,503 --> 00:49:24,028
The whole national mythology
was that Vietnam was a consensus war,

735
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:25,903
was bipartisan foreign policy,

736
00:49:26,032 --> 00:49:29,994
all significant sectors
of the American public accepted the war

737
00:49:30,116 --> 00:49:33,668
and the people who opposed it
were marginalised freaks, kooks,

738
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,553
unimportant people.

739
00:49:36,564 --> 00:49:38,521
It was a real statement to say,

740
00:49:38,646 --> 00:49:41,207
''Yes, I am willing to march
against the war.''

741
00:49:41,328 --> 00:49:44,880
When thousands of people did that,
it broke that consensus.

742
00:49:45,012 --> 00:49:48,086
That's what the anti-Vietnam War
movement did.

743
00:49:48,216 --> 00:49:49,888
It broke that consensus.

744
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:12,720
- Go ahead, react.
- React to what?

745
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:17,318
React to the greatness of the march
on the day. Are you happy with that?

746
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:40,671
Ronald Reagan walked
onto the political stage

747
00:50:40,793 --> 00:50:45,188
as a candidate for governor in 1 966.
During his campaign,

748
00:50:45,318 --> 00:50:48,630
he found that attacking what
he called ''the mess at Berkeley''

749
00:50:48,761 --> 00:50:50,433
pleased the crowds.

750
00:50:50,563 --> 00:50:54,320
It began a year ago when
the so-called free speech advocates,

751
00:50:54,448 --> 00:50:58,080
who in truth have no appreciation
for freedom,

752
00:50:58,212 --> 00:51:00,329
were allowed to assault and humiliate

753
00:51:00,454 --> 00:51:03,528
the symbol of law and order,
the policemen, on the campus.

754
00:51:03,657 --> 00:51:05,853
That was the moment
when the ringleaders

755
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:09,532
should've been thrown out
of the university once and for all.

756
00:51:09,664 --> 00:51:13,216
He won by pandering to a citizenry
that was outraged

757
00:51:13,348 --> 00:51:15,909
by what these insolent,
ungrateful children

758
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:18,182
were doing on the campuses.

759
00:51:18,313 --> 00:51:20,464
As a matter of fact, I have here

760
00:51:20,596 --> 00:51:24,148
a copy of a report of the district
attorney of Alameda County.

761
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:28,835
It concerns a dance sponsored
by the Vietnam Day Committee,

762
00:51:28,965 --> 00:51:31,925
sanctioned by the university
as a student activity,

763
00:51:32,048 --> 00:51:36,568
and was held in the men's gymnasium
of the University of California.

764
00:51:36,694 --> 00:51:38,811
The incidents are so bad,

765
00:51:38,936 --> 00:51:41,497
so contrary to our standards
of human behaviour

766
00:51:41,618 --> 00:51:45,979
that I couldn't possibly recite them
to you here in detail.

767
00:51:46,104 --> 00:51:47,822
But there is evidence of things

768
00:51:47,946 --> 00:51:50,860
that shouldn't be permitted
on a university campus.

769
00:51:50,989 --> 00:51:53,504
Let me just read a few excerpts.

770
00:51:53,631 --> 00:51:57,513
''The total crowd at the dance
was in excess of 3,000,

771
00:51:57,636 --> 00:52:01,074
including a number
of less-than-college-aged juveniles.''

772
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,955
''Three rock'n'roll bands
were in the gymnasium

773
00:52:04,083 --> 00:52:06,040
playing simultaneously

774
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:09,922
and all during the dance
movies were shown on two screens

775
00:52:10,049 --> 00:52:12,484
at the opposite ends
of the gymnasium.''

776
00:52:12,612 --> 00:52:15,367
''These movies were the only lights
in the gym.''

777
00:52:15,496 --> 00:52:17,533
''They consisted of colour sequences,

778
00:52:17,658 --> 00:52:21,131
different coloured liquids
spreading across the screen,

779
00:52:21,261 --> 00:52:23,936
followed by shots of men and women
on occasion.''

780
00:52:24,065 --> 00:52:28,186
''Shots where the men and women's
nude torsos on occasion...''

781
00:52:28,309 --> 00:52:32,385
''And persons twisted and gyrated
in provocative and sensual fashion.''

782
00:53:00,984 --> 00:53:03,545
This portion of the Gray Line
in the city

783
00:53:03,667 --> 00:53:08,791
is the first and only foreign tour
within the continental limits.

784
00:53:09,875 --> 00:53:13,837
The fountainhead
of the hippie subculture.

785
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:19,362
The hippies' is often a strange world
which they live in.

786
00:53:19,485 --> 00:53:21,522
They take many trips.

787
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:30,051
And the trip of a hippie
is generally an unusual one.

788
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:35,178
Across the bay from Berkeley,

789
00:53:35,302 --> 00:53:38,341
a counterculture emerged
on the streets of San Francisco.

790
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:40,616
Descended from
beatnik era hipsters,

791
00:53:40,747 --> 00:53:43,103
hippies further exposed the chasm

792
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:45,871
between our parents' generation
and our own.

793
00:53:45,993 --> 00:53:48,554
By 1 966, more and more of us

794
00:53:48,677 --> 00:53:51,432
were turning on, tuning in
and dropping out.

795
00:53:51,559 --> 00:53:56,034
Our alienation ran much deeper
than political protest.

796
00:53:56,164 --> 00:53:59,921
We were all beginning to see
that it was much bigger than the war.

797
00:54:00,049 --> 00:54:04,569
It was much, much bigger
than the civil rights movement.

798
00:54:04,693 --> 00:54:07,448
There were major things wrong.

799
00:54:07,576 --> 00:54:11,333
I think the people who got involved
in the counterculture

800
00:54:11,461 --> 00:54:14,421
perceived that they did not want
to be a part

801
00:54:14,545 --> 00:54:18,302
of what was wrong with a culture
that was destroying the world.

802
00:54:18,428 --> 00:54:22,390
I can see that much better in
retrospect than I could right then.

803
00:54:22,513 --> 00:54:28,388
But the point is that it was
the culture that was sick.

804
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:34,361
It was the whole American way
of looking at things that was sick.

805
00:54:34,486 --> 00:54:38,243
So I think we came to a realisation
that one way to change that

806
00:54:38,370 --> 00:54:40,327
is to just live it differently.

807
00:54:40,453 --> 00:54:43,208
lnstead of trying
to change the structure

808
00:54:43,336 --> 00:54:45,373
in a direct confrontational way,

809
00:54:45,497 --> 00:54:50,131
you just drop out and live it
the way you think it ought to be.

810
00:54:51,104 --> 00:54:53,665
Do you play anything
besides a sweet potato?

811
00:54:53,787 --> 00:54:57,942
Just the drums and the trumpet.

812
00:54:58,071 --> 00:55:01,429
Yeah, and I go up in the mountains
and yell now and then.

813
00:55:01,555 --> 00:55:04,674
- You do what?
- Go up in the mountains and yell.

814
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:07,759
Way up high in the mountains
and yell as hard as I can.

815
00:55:07,882 --> 00:55:10,637
- What's the purpose of that?
- To greet the dawn

816
00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:14,443
and the greet the noonday sun
and to greet the sunset.

817
00:55:14,569 --> 00:55:17,529
You stay all day
yelling at morning, noon and night?

818
00:55:17,653 --> 00:55:21,011
Right. And standing on my head
and making gardens

819
00:55:21,137 --> 00:55:22,695
and painting pictures.

820
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:25,574
You not only play the sweet potato,
you also grow them?

821
00:55:25,701 --> 00:55:27,259
Right.

822
00:55:28,424 --> 00:55:35,701
Why do you indulge in smoking
this... these narcotic cigarettes?

823
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:37,586
Why do people drink alcohol?

824
00:55:38,955 --> 00:55:41,915
- lt's the same reason.
- lt's a big Ping-Pong table.

825
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:44,999
You say why do we do this
and we say, ''Why do you do this?''

826
00:55:45,122 --> 00:55:48,879
We don't agree... You're the mess.
We're trying to change it.

827
00:55:49,007 --> 00:55:51,363
Why? What are you trying
to change it to?

828
00:55:51,489 --> 00:55:53,845
What are your principles?
Do you have any?

829
00:55:53,972 --> 00:55:58,287
We're not trying to change anything.
We're just trying to be ourselves

830
00:55:58,417 --> 00:56:02,129
- and do what we think is right.
- Why don't you go out in the desert

831
00:56:02,261 --> 00:56:04,298
instead of dirtying up a community?

832
00:56:04,423 --> 00:56:06,415
We're not dirtying up anything.

833
00:56:08,788 --> 00:56:14,265
My parents sent away to the Bay Area
a serious young folk singer.

834
00:56:14,394 --> 00:56:17,149
I came back with long hair
down to there.

835
00:56:17,277 --> 00:56:21,239
I was wearing an enormous
amount of beads around my neck.

836
00:56:21,361 --> 00:56:25,403
They figured I had abandoned
everything I was taught.

837
00:56:25,526 --> 00:56:27,677
I realised...

838
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:30,881
We had big arguments
about this stuff.

839
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:35,293
I tried to convince them to sell
their furniture and go to lndia.

840
00:56:35,417 --> 00:56:37,886
And they weren't going for it.

841
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:42,177
I realised that no matter how far out
their political views were,

842
00:56:42,305 --> 00:56:45,219
because they were mighty unpopular,

843
00:56:45,347 --> 00:56:48,421
my parents were pretty left wing,

844
00:56:48,551 --> 00:56:52,992
that really they were materialists.

845
00:56:53,116 --> 00:56:56,474
They were concerned about
how the wealth was divided up.

846
00:56:56,599 --> 00:57:00,641
At that point, in my consciousness,
I didn't care about wealth.

847
00:57:00,764 --> 00:57:03,758
We were actually living communally,

848
00:57:03,888 --> 00:57:07,679
rather than talking about communism.

849
00:57:07,812 --> 00:57:11,364
Sell that radio.
Get rid of the subscription.

850
00:57:11,495 --> 00:57:15,856
Tune in to those other bands
that do not broadcast in words,

851
00:57:15,981 --> 00:57:17,734
that broadcast in joy.

852
00:57:17,863 --> 00:57:20,857
The form of God
is the joy of his discovery.

853
00:57:20,986 --> 00:57:23,023
Up, up, up.

854
00:57:23,869 --> 00:57:26,669
Everybody goes up.

855
00:57:30,076 --> 00:57:33,036
The counterculture
burst onto the Berkeley campus

856
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:35,516
during a strike in the fall of '66.

857
00:57:35,641 --> 00:57:37,120
At the close of a meeting,

858
00:57:37,243 --> 00:57:39,998
students started to sing
Solidarity Forever

859
00:57:40,127 --> 00:57:42,768
then suddenly switched
to Yellow Submarine.

860
00:57:43,611 --> 00:57:46,685
They're singing,
''We all live in a yellow submarine.''

861
00:57:46,814 --> 00:57:50,492
- What does this mean?
- Again, it's difficult to explain.

862
00:57:50,618 --> 00:57:55,298
I think... We take this music seriously
and there's a meaning.

863
00:57:55,423 --> 00:57:58,781
A meaning which everyone
can interpret differently

864
00:57:58,907 --> 00:58:00,864
about the yellow submarine.

865
00:58:00,990 --> 00:58:02,139
lt's a sort of...

866
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:05,150
lt's an understanding
that we're banding together

867
00:58:05,274 --> 00:58:07,550
in a yellow submarine

868
00:58:07,676 --> 00:58:11,274
and it represents
a new way of looking at life.

869
00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:23,644
The radicals of Berkeley
and the hippies of Haight-Ashbury

870
00:58:23,774 --> 00:58:25,127
had a natural affinity.

871
00:58:25,256 --> 00:58:28,614
We were visionaries,
critical of conventional society.

872
00:58:28,739 --> 00:58:31,619
But we disagreed
about how to change the world.

873
00:58:31,742 --> 00:58:35,579
This running argument came to a head
over the war in Vietnam.

874
00:58:40,673 --> 00:58:42,630
Sometime in late 1 966,

875
00:58:42,754 --> 00:58:45,873
Bill Miller, who'd been active
in the Vietnam War movement

876
00:58:45,998 --> 00:58:47,397
and ran a bar in Berkeley,

877
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:50,241
called some people
active in the anti-war movement

878
00:58:50,363 --> 00:58:51,921
to a meeting behind his bar.

879
00:58:52,045 --> 00:58:55,927
Some people from Haight-Ashbury
were organising some kind of activity.

880
00:58:56,049 --> 00:58:58,929
They wanted to tell us about it
and ask for support.

881
00:58:59,052 --> 00:59:00,930
It was going to be the first be-in.

882
00:59:01,054 --> 00:59:03,330
There was one this fella
in particular,

883
00:59:03,457 --> 00:59:06,531
he was trying to really get us
excited about the plan.

884
00:59:06,661 --> 00:59:09,939
He said, ''We're going to have
so much music

885
00:59:10,064 --> 00:59:13,742
and so much love and so much energy

886
00:59:13,868 --> 00:59:18,821
that we're going to
stop the war in Vietnam!''

887
00:59:32,248 --> 00:59:36,529
The politics of hip is that we were
setting up a new world, as it were,

888
00:59:36,653 --> 00:59:38,724
that would run parallel
to the old world

889
00:59:38,855 --> 00:59:41,131
but have as little to do with it
as possible.

890
00:59:41,258 --> 00:59:43,979
We just weren't going to deal
with straight people.

891
00:59:44,101 --> 00:59:46,742
And to us, the politicals,

892
00:59:46,863 --> 00:59:50,301
a lot of the leaders of the anti-war
movement were straight people,

893
00:59:50,427 --> 00:59:53,102
as they were still concerned
with the government.

894
00:59:53,231 --> 00:59:55,587
They were going
to march on Washington.

895
00:59:55,714 --> 00:59:58,753
We didn't even want to know
that Washington was there!

896
00:59:58,877 --> 01:00:02,953
We thought that eventually the whole
world would stop all this nonsense

897
01:00:03,081 --> 01:00:06,554
and start loving each other
as soon as they all got turned on.

898
01:00:06,685 --> 01:00:11,365
lt's amazing that these movements
coexisted at the same time,

899
01:00:11,491 --> 01:00:15,852
and were in stark contrast
in certain respects,

900
01:00:15,975 --> 01:00:22,375
but as the 1 960s progressed,
they drew closer together

901
01:00:22,503 --> 01:00:26,135
and began taking on
aspects of the other.

902
01:01:03,787 --> 01:01:05,744
As Burns stumbled out of that bunker

903
01:01:05,869 --> 01:01:10,230
dazed, with blood on him,
parts of his friends on him,

904
01:01:10,354 --> 01:01:12,915
he collapsed
into the arms of Larry Craig,

905
01:01:13,037 --> 01:01:14,709
and he mumbled to Larry Craig.

906
01:01:14,839 --> 01:01:17,514
He didn't mumble,
''Those bastard Vietcong.''

907
01:01:17,642 --> 01:01:20,522
He didn't mumble,
''Those bastard communists.''

908
01:01:20,645 --> 01:01:23,719
He didn't mumble,
''Those slope-eyed bastards.''

909
01:01:23,849 --> 01:01:26,524
He mumbled only one thing
over and over.

910
01:01:26,652 --> 01:01:30,887
''That bastard Johnson.
That bastard Johnson.''

911
01:01:31,017 --> 01:01:37,098
The aim is to build
a powerful peace block

912
01:01:37,223 --> 01:01:43,384
that can really have influence
in the 1 968 elections,

913
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:44,863
and we must make it clear

914
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:49,068
that we are not going to let our
political forces and the politicians

915
01:01:49,196 --> 01:01:54,798
ignore Vietnam in 1 968.

916
01:01:54,923 --> 01:02:00,844
This must be an issue
if that tragic war is still going on.

917
01:02:00,969 --> 01:02:05,284
And so, as the war hawks
escalate the war in Vietnam,

918
01:02:05,414 --> 01:02:09,969
we must escalate
our protest against the war.

919
01:02:10,099 --> 01:02:14,414
We're in front of
the Oakland lnduction Center today

920
01:02:14,543 --> 01:02:18,778
because this place
is going to be closed down

921
01:02:18,908 --> 01:02:22,266
October 1 6th to 21 st.

922
01:02:22,392 --> 01:02:26,354
We are declaring a draft holiday
for that period,

923
01:02:26,476 --> 01:02:29,390
and we're going to
close this building down.

924
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,830
The movement
from protest to resistance,

925
01:02:31,963 --> 01:02:34,798
which was the official slogan
of Stop The Draft Week

926
01:02:34,926 --> 01:02:37,886
and became a major slogan
within the anti-war movement,

927
01:02:38,009 --> 01:02:41,128
had something to do with the logic
of the anti-war movement.

928
01:02:41,252 --> 01:02:43,209
There'd been six, seven, eight years

929
01:02:43,335 --> 01:02:48,208
of educating people about the war
and of protesting it.

930
01:02:48,341 --> 01:02:51,176
Meanwhile, the war
was being escalated all the time,

931
01:02:51,303 --> 01:02:52,975
getting worse and worse,

932
01:02:53,105 --> 01:02:55,336
and there was a feeling of impotence

933
01:02:55,468 --> 01:02:59,180
in the face of the further escalation
of the war.

934
01:02:59,312 --> 01:03:03,149
We were becoming much more
alienated from American society

935
01:03:03,277 --> 01:03:06,955
and much more willing
to be disruptive of that society,

936
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:10,678
and, basically,
we began moving toward the view

937
01:03:10,805 --> 01:03:17,080
that we wanted to make the cost
of pursuing the war abroad

938
01:03:17,212 --> 01:03:20,844
the ungovernability
of the society at home.

939
01:03:20,975 --> 01:03:24,287
l'd been very influenced
by Martin Luther King and Gandhi,

940
01:03:24,419 --> 01:03:28,131
I believed very deeply
in non-violent civil disobedience,

941
01:03:28,264 --> 01:03:32,021
and here were these leaders on campus...
I was a graduate student,

942
01:03:32,147 --> 01:03:36,428
and they were saying,
''We have to raise the stakes.''

943
01:03:36,552 --> 01:03:39,512
''We have to stop the war
in a much more militant way.''

944
01:03:39,636 --> 01:03:41,593
I found their rhetoric seductive.

945
01:03:41,718 --> 01:03:44,917
I think we were pretty convinced

946
01:03:45,041 --> 01:03:48,719
that we were going to shut down
the induction centre when we went there.

947
01:03:48,846 --> 01:03:51,646
We felt strong,
there were a lot of us,

948
01:03:51,769 --> 01:03:55,047
we felt well organised,
we had a lot of planning meetings.

949
01:03:55,173 --> 01:03:59,055
We didn't want to say,
''We don't cooperate with the war.''

950
01:03:59,177 --> 01:04:03,253
We wanted to say, ''We aren't going
to allow you to wage the war.''

951
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:05,134
''We're going to fight you.''

952
01:04:09,068 --> 01:04:12,700
Tuesday morning, the police came in,
wielding their clubs.

953
01:04:12,831 --> 01:04:14,230
They took us seriously.

954
01:04:14,353 --> 01:04:18,235
We said we were going to fight them,
so they fought us. lt was a disaster.

955
01:04:18,358 --> 01:04:21,511
We just melted. They wiped us out.

956
01:04:43,865 --> 01:04:45,936
Now it was, ''Here come the buses,

957
01:04:46,068 --> 01:04:49,905
and there is not a damn thing
you can do about it.''

958
01:04:50,031 --> 01:04:53,583
I began seeing all these young faces
in the windows going by me

959
01:04:53,716 --> 01:04:57,189
and I just wanted to reach out
and just grab them and stop them

960
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:01,236
and say, ''Listen, this is your life
you're putting on the line here.''

961
01:05:01,365 --> 01:05:04,006
But what came out was, ''Don't go.''

962
01:05:12,777 --> 01:05:16,055
Join our lines. You don't have to go.
All you do is say no.

963
01:05:16,180 --> 01:05:19,458
Say no. You don't have to go.
You don't have to go.

964
01:05:19,584 --> 01:05:23,375
You don't have to go.
You don't have to go.

965
01:05:23,508 --> 01:05:27,026
There were bus-load after bus-load
after bus-load

966
01:05:27,152 --> 01:05:31,547
of young men that day,
and they were going off to die.

967
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:34,671
And I remember
being physically sickened,

968
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:41,518
realising that I couldn't affect
even that part of the war.

969
01:05:41,648 --> 01:05:44,483
Here I was, face to face
with these young men,

970
01:05:44,611 --> 01:05:48,402
and yet not one of them turned back.

971
01:05:48,535 --> 01:05:52,816
I don't think we stopped one inductee
from making that critical choice

972
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:55,615
of stepping across the line
and going to Vietnam.

973
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:59,659
I don't think we made one bit
of difference that day.

974
01:05:59,787 --> 01:06:03,260
- Does the demonstration bother you?
- No, I think it's funny.

975
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:06,146
All them bums running round,
doing nothing.

976
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:16,199
Tomorrow we go down there
twice as strong as we did today.

977
01:06:20,090 --> 01:06:24,610
We go down there with
twice as many shields as we did today,

978
01:06:24,734 --> 01:06:28,207
and we go down there
with everybody wearing one of these.

979
01:06:28,338 --> 01:06:30,091
If you can see the dents in there,

980
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:32,451
I don't know
if you can see it from here,

981
01:06:32,583 --> 01:06:35,816
but that's what stands between me
and a cracked skull

982
01:06:35,946 --> 01:06:38,746
from the highway patrol
of the state of California.

983
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:41,864
- Where do we get the hats?
- Where do you get the hats?

984
01:06:41,993 --> 01:06:45,271
- Army & Navy Surplus.
- Army & Navy Surplus.

985
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:50,361
We didn't give up.
We didn't say, ''lt didn't work.''

986
01:06:50,482 --> 01:06:54,957
We were able to build
for another demonstration on Friday,

987
01:06:55,087 --> 01:06:57,922
and on Friday
we, in fact, had our riot,

988
01:06:58,051 --> 01:06:59,769
the riot that we had planned.

989
01:07:46,823 --> 01:07:48,655
The event that I remember the most

990
01:07:48,785 --> 01:07:52,258
was when the students surged
and pushed against the police

991
01:07:52,390 --> 01:07:54,541
and pushed them back,
block after block.

992
01:07:54,671 --> 01:07:57,267
I remember thinking,
''This is like a metaphor.''

993
01:07:57,394 --> 01:08:02,074
''lf enough Americans believed the war
were wrong, we could end it.''

994
01:08:40,201 --> 01:08:45,074
We controlled the downtown area
of Oakland for most of the day,

995
01:08:45,207 --> 01:08:48,485
and the cops were outnumbered
and confused and scared.

996
01:08:48,610 --> 01:08:50,522
We shut down the induction centre.

997
01:08:50,652 --> 01:08:53,407
We did what we said we'd do,
we shut the mother down.

998
01:08:53,535 --> 01:08:56,973
I went
to the Stop The Draft Week protests.

999
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:59,376
And what I saw there
made me convinced

1000
01:08:59,501 --> 01:09:02,301
that action in the streets
of that sort

1001
01:09:02,425 --> 01:09:06,626
was not going to lead to the kind
of change necessary to stop the war.

1002
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:10,223
I saw a lot of people from Berkeley
tear people's fences down.

1003
01:09:10,354 --> 01:09:14,032
Fences that belonged to people
that probably made $5,000 a year

1004
01:09:14,157 --> 01:09:16,832
were ripped out
to block people's cars.

1005
01:09:16,961 --> 01:09:21,675
Bobby Avakian, son of a judge,
a well-known young would-be radical,

1006
01:09:21,806 --> 01:09:24,880
let the air out of the tyres
of the district attorney.

1007
01:09:25,010 --> 01:09:26,728
This was going to stop the war?

1008
01:09:26,851 --> 01:09:32,249
I just thought this was a burlesque
of opposition to the war.

1009
01:09:32,377 --> 01:09:34,175
There's nothing else to do.

1010
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:36,861
The picketing and all of that
wasn't working.

1011
01:09:36,983 --> 01:09:38,815
lt's time for confrontation.

1012
01:09:38,945 --> 01:09:41,301
We did stumble upon a strategy
where we said,

1013
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:44,501
''lf you continue that war in Vietnam,

1014
01:09:44,631 --> 01:09:48,263
there's going to be chaos here
in the streets of the United States.''

1015
01:09:48,395 --> 01:09:51,628
''Every place you try
to do anything to do with the war,

1016
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:55,037
there's going to be
thousands of young people rioting,

1017
01:09:55,162 --> 01:09:56,960
trying to stop you from doing it.''

1018
01:09:57,084 --> 01:09:59,553
While it was a great success
a turning point,

1019
01:09:59,687 --> 01:10:02,077
it was also
the first clear demonstration

1020
01:10:02,210 --> 01:10:06,491
that the radical part
of the anti-Vietnam War movement

1021
01:10:06,614 --> 01:10:09,733
was coming up
against its own limitations.

1022
01:10:09,858 --> 01:10:14,731
It didn't really have the weight
in society to stop the war.

1023
01:10:14,864 --> 01:10:17,140
I think that it was after that

1024
01:10:17,266 --> 01:10:18,984
that the Berkeley radical scene

1025
01:10:19,108 --> 01:10:21,577
became more and more
cut off from reality,

1026
01:10:21,711 --> 01:10:24,386
and the question
of moving American society,

1027
01:10:24,514 --> 01:10:28,430
changing people,
really was getting lost.

1028
01:10:28,558 --> 01:10:31,472
- Move. l've got to go to work.
- There's a war on.

1029
01:10:31,602 --> 01:10:33,559
I don't care. l've got to go to work.

1030
01:10:39,290 --> 01:10:46,328
We began to see ourselves as,
you know, glue in the keyholes.

1031
01:10:46,457 --> 01:10:50,339
We began to see ourselves
as obstacles

1032
01:10:50,462 --> 01:10:57,021
in the way of the system
fulfilling its potential

1033
01:10:57,150 --> 01:11:00,303
for wreaking destruction
all over the world.

1034
01:11:00,432 --> 01:11:03,631
I think we began to see ourselves

1035
01:11:03,756 --> 01:11:08,231
as being as big a pain in the butt
as we could,

1036
01:11:08,362 --> 01:11:13,360
and I think we lost the idea
that we could be victorious.

1037
01:11:13,487 --> 01:11:18,167
As confrontation and sit-in
and street demonstrations escalated,

1038
01:11:18,292 --> 01:11:22,573
the rest of the United States'
political community was left behind.

1039
01:11:22,697 --> 01:11:26,978
I was interested in the rest of the
United States, in the Newport Beach.

1040
01:11:27,101 --> 01:11:28,979
Those people l'd failed with

1041
01:11:29,104 --> 01:11:31,825
in the Thanksgiving vacation
Free Speech Movement

1042
01:11:31,947 --> 01:11:35,420
were the people you had to reach
if you were going to stop the war,

1043
01:11:35,551 --> 01:11:38,829
and the way to do that was not
to go down and sit in in the streets

1044
01:11:38,954 --> 01:11:41,344
in front of
the Oakland Draft lnduction Center

1045
01:11:41,477 --> 01:11:43,514
and tear up fences
and block streets.

1046
01:11:43,639 --> 01:11:46,439
The way to do that
was to be active electorally.

1047
01:11:46,563 --> 01:11:50,115
After the Tet Offensive,
when Westmoreland came to Johnson,

1048
01:11:50,247 --> 01:11:53,639
and said, ''ln order to continue
the land war in Vietnam,

1049
01:11:53,770 --> 01:11:56,445
we're going to need a million men,''

1050
01:11:56,573 --> 01:11:59,931
Johnson was told by J Edgar Hoover

1051
01:12:00,057 --> 01:12:04,133
that if we tried to get a million men
out of this country,

1052
01:12:04,261 --> 01:12:08,337
he could not ensure
the domestic security of this country.

1053
01:12:08,466 --> 01:12:12,462
And that was one of the questions,
one of the considerations he made,

1054
01:12:12,591 --> 01:12:14,822
when he decided to end the land war,

1055
01:12:14,954 --> 01:12:18,632
to begin to pull back
from the land war, and to resign

1056
01:12:18,757 --> 01:12:21,432
as an expression
of the failure of his policy

1057
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:23,916
to win the war in Vietnam.

1058
01:12:24,043 --> 01:12:29,121
And Hoover saying
that he couldn't protect,

1059
01:12:29,249 --> 01:12:32,722
he couldn't ensure domestic security,
was a truthful statement

1060
01:12:32,852 --> 01:12:35,732
about the power
of the anti-war movement at that time.

1061
01:12:35,856 --> 01:12:39,534
We did put limits on America's
ability to wage the war in Vietnam.

1062
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:45,182
I shall not seek

1063
01:12:45,306 --> 01:12:47,775
and I will not accept

1064
01:12:47,909 --> 01:12:52,350
the nomination of my party
for another term as your president.

1065
01:12:53,235 --> 01:12:55,831
We want to talk about this thing
called violence

1066
01:12:55,958 --> 01:12:57,915
that everybody is so afraid about.

1067
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,954
Here you are, talking about
you're afraid of violence,

1068
01:13:01,083 --> 01:13:05,603
and the honky drafted you
out of school to go fight in Vietnam.

1069
01:13:05,729 --> 01:13:09,930
You sit in front of your TV sets
and listen to LBJ tell you

1070
01:13:10,053 --> 01:13:15,451
that violence never accomplishes
anything, my fellow Americans.

1071
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:19,778
You ought to tell him clear,
''lf you don't want any trouble,

1072
01:13:19,904 --> 01:13:23,377
keep your filthy white hands
off our beautiful black skin.''

1073
01:13:23,507 --> 01:13:25,897
Keep them off. Keep them off.

1074
01:13:42,969 --> 01:13:46,647
In the streets of Oakland,
a few miles from the Berkeley campus,

1075
01:13:46,773 --> 01:13:50,815
the Black Panthers came forward
as the cutting edge of Black Power.

1076
01:13:50,937 --> 01:13:54,819
Their militancy had a magnetic effect
on the student movement.

1077
01:13:54,942 --> 01:13:58,175
We want the Panthers to be our friends.

1078
01:13:58,305 --> 01:14:01,538
We want to follow their lead

1079
01:14:01,669 --> 01:14:05,221
in some fashion that's confusing,
that's mysterious.

1080
01:14:05,353 --> 01:14:08,631
All we are aware of, we want to go,
black and white together,

1081
01:14:08,757 --> 01:14:11,796
into some positive future
against the oppressor

1082
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:14,071
who was feeling ever more oppressive.

1083
01:14:14,203 --> 01:14:17,881
Bobby Seale and Huey Newton
formed the Black Panther Party

1084
01:14:18,006 --> 01:14:19,678
in the fall of '66.

1085
01:14:19,808 --> 01:14:21,845
They drew up a ten-point platform

1086
01:14:21,971 --> 01:14:25,489
addressing community needs
from education to housing.

1087
01:14:25,615 --> 01:14:27,891
The most pressing issue
was police violence

1088
01:14:28,018 --> 01:14:29,896
against Oakland's black community.

1089
01:14:30,019 --> 01:14:33,537
The Panthers decided to arm
themselves and patrol the police.

1090
01:14:33,663 --> 01:14:36,737
People might imagine
we were right behind the police car.

1091
01:14:36,867 --> 01:14:39,827
No. We may be four blocks away.
We just drive through.

1092
01:14:39,951 --> 01:14:43,070
If we see the police arrest somebody,
we'd get out of the car

1093
01:14:43,193 --> 01:14:45,389
with our guns, tape recorders,
law books.

1094
01:14:45,516 --> 01:14:48,669
By now, we have six, seven members
doing this, all with guns.

1095
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:52,078
How we got our guns
was fantastic, too, the first guns.

1096
01:14:52,204 --> 01:14:56,086
The Little Red Book, The Thoughts
Of Chairman Mao Tse-Tung.

1097
01:14:56,207 --> 01:15:00,089
Huey calls me and says, ''l know how
we can raise some money for guns.''

1098
01:15:00,212 --> 01:15:03,890
I said, ''How?'' He said, ''The Little
Red Book. lt's all over the news.''

1099
01:15:04,017 --> 01:15:07,295
''l heard you can buy them
at the China bookstore in Frisco.''

1100
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:10,141
''How much money have you got?''
I said, ''50 bucks.''

1101
01:15:10,263 --> 01:15:13,337
We run to the China bookstore,
buy about 1 00 of these books.

1102
01:15:13,466 --> 01:15:15,935
We got our guns strapped on our side.
I got a .45,

1103
01:15:16,069 --> 01:15:18,904
Huey's holding a shotgun,
Little Bobby's got a Carbine.

1104
01:15:19,033 --> 01:15:22,072
We got these bags over our shoulders
with Little Red Books.

1105
01:15:22,196 --> 01:15:25,908
''Red Books! $1 !'' We were buying them
for 20 cents and selling them for $1 ,

1106
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:29,318
Berkeley Campus,
at Sather Gate right there!

1107
01:15:29,444 --> 01:15:31,675
We sold out in the matter of an hour.

1108
01:15:31,807 --> 01:15:34,881
We took this 1 00 bucks
and we'd buy some more Red Books.

1109
01:15:35,009 --> 01:15:38,482
We made $200, $300. We went out
and bought two shotguns that day

1110
01:15:38,614 --> 01:15:41,892
with The Little Red Book!
We hadn't even read the thing.

1111
01:15:42,018 --> 01:15:46,094
People think we came up with this
hardcore ideology related to Mao...

1112
01:15:46,222 --> 01:15:48,532
We must have sold the book
two or three months

1113
01:15:48,664 --> 01:15:51,817
before we decided to open the thing
and actually read it.

1114
01:15:51,948 --> 01:15:55,864
Anyway, the next thing I know,
l'm marching on the Capitol.

1115
01:15:55,993 --> 01:15:59,511
Because we were up there to protest
a bill they were trying to put in

1116
01:15:59,637 --> 01:16:01,309
to keep us from carrying guns.

1117
01:16:01,438 --> 01:16:04,113
Ronald Reagan is over here
on the big front lawn.

1118
01:16:04,241 --> 01:16:06,073
I got a statement to read.

1119
01:16:06,204 --> 01:16:10,325
The Black Panther Party calls upon
American people in general

1120
01:16:10,448 --> 01:16:12,201
and the black people in particular

1121
01:16:12,331 --> 01:16:16,088
to take note
of the racist California legislature,

1122
01:16:16,214 --> 01:16:18,126
which is considering legislation

1123
01:16:18,256 --> 01:16:21,136
aimed at keeping black people
disarmed and powerless

1124
01:16:21,260 --> 01:16:24,938
at the very same time racist police
agencies throughout the country

1125
01:16:25,064 --> 01:16:30,017
are intensifying the terror, brutality,
murder and repression of black people.

1126
01:16:30,149 --> 01:16:34,590
Ronald Reagan is escorted off the lawn
by the state capitol police.

1127
01:16:34,715 --> 01:16:38,427
I said, ''We can go inside somewhere.
lsn't there a spectator section?''

1128
01:16:38,559 --> 01:16:43,591
I have these Black Panthers up here.

1129
01:16:43,724 --> 01:16:44,713
Can we get in here?

1130
01:16:44,845 --> 01:16:47,919
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
- Are you going to arrest him?

1131
01:16:48,049 --> 01:16:51,840
- Am I under arrest?
- Did you place him under arrest?

1132
01:16:51,974 --> 01:16:55,765
Am I under arrest? Take your hands
off me if l'm not under arrest.

1133
01:16:55,897 --> 01:16:59,289
- Am I under arrest?
- Take your hands off me!

1134
01:16:59,421 --> 01:17:02,939
They've put trumped-up charges
of conspiracy and felonies

1135
01:17:03,065 --> 01:17:06,343
on everyone who went in
to exercise a constitutional right

1136
01:17:06,469 --> 01:17:09,827
and said they had no right
to bear arms in a public place.

1137
01:17:09,952 --> 01:17:14,073
The California penal code,
section 1 2020 through 1 2027,

1138
01:17:14,197 --> 01:17:16,666
and the Second Amendment
of the Constitution

1139
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:21,639
guarantees the citizen a right
to bear arms on public property.

1140
01:17:21,765 --> 01:17:26,604
Our organisation was like a social
evolutionary accident, so to speak.

1141
01:17:26,731 --> 01:17:30,009
When you compare
the NAACP from 1 908

1142
01:17:30,135 --> 01:17:32,776
and other organisations, etc,

1143
01:17:32,897 --> 01:17:36,370
and all the years they put in
to become established,

1144
01:17:36,501 --> 01:17:41,021
in just six months the Black Panther
Party has international notoriety.

1145
01:17:41,146 --> 01:17:45,461
We're on the front page of the London
Times and papers in Africa somewhere.

1146
01:17:45,592 --> 01:17:48,950
We were a broke little organisation
with a number of shotguns,

1147
01:17:49,075 --> 01:17:52,627
a very weak treasury, and we were
worried about how to pay the rent.

1148
01:17:52,759 --> 01:17:56,037
And, boom.
I mean, we were shocking people.

1149
01:17:56,163 --> 01:18:00,045
We have probably said
to white America...

1150
01:18:00,167 --> 01:18:03,845
The people who were observing us
when we came out with the guns

1151
01:18:03,971 --> 01:18:06,247
are saying, ''Niggers with guns!''

1152
01:18:06,374 --> 01:18:09,652
lt's like a fear.
They don't even have to say it.

1153
01:18:09,778 --> 01:18:13,251
Their faces said it.
''There's too many niggers with guns.''

1154
01:18:13,381 --> 01:18:15,452
Like they know
that they repressed us,

1155
01:18:15,583 --> 01:18:19,261
and now we were organised with guns.
This is the new step.

1156
01:18:19,388 --> 01:18:23,225
lt's symbolic that, ''They're not
going to be non-violent any more.''

1157
01:18:29,358 --> 01:18:32,636
On the night of October 28th 1 967,

1158
01:18:32,762 --> 01:18:36,553
Huey Newton was stopped by police.
There was gunfire.

1159
01:18:36,687 --> 01:18:40,478
Officer Fry was killed, and Huey
Newton was arrested for murder.

1160
01:18:40,610 --> 01:18:42,966
His trial drew the student movement

1161
01:18:43,093 --> 01:18:45,768
into an alliance
with the Black Panthers.

1162
01:18:45,896 --> 01:18:49,653
''Free Huey'' became our rallying cry.

1163
01:18:49,781 --> 01:18:52,057
The organisation just propelled.

1164
01:18:52,183 --> 01:18:56,942
It took off like a prairie fire,
it spread everywhere.

1165
01:18:57,068 --> 01:18:59,344
Certainly beyond my imagination.

1166
01:18:59,471 --> 01:19:02,351
After Huey's arrest,

1167
01:19:02,475 --> 01:19:05,150
that's when things
really started rolling.

1168
01:19:05,277 --> 01:19:07,952
Free Huey now or else!
Free Huey now or else!

1169
01:19:19,773 --> 01:19:23,246
The Panthers
exercised a heavy influence

1170
01:19:23,377 --> 01:19:26,257
in the imagination of the white left,

1171
01:19:26,380 --> 01:19:30,661
partly because the white left
was confused about who it was

1172
01:19:30,785 --> 01:19:33,061
and what it ought to do.

1173
01:19:33,187 --> 01:19:35,862
They were fascinated
by this tough, macho image

1174
01:19:35,990 --> 01:19:40,863
and they followed it not so much
wilfully but involuntarily,

1175
01:19:40,996 --> 01:19:44,878
because it was a projection out there
of the thing in their own actions

1176
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,672
that thrilled them most.

1177
01:19:46,802 --> 01:19:50,275
We had captured the imagination
of the white radical left

1178
01:19:50,406 --> 01:19:53,879
to a point
that its whole identification

1179
01:19:54,010 --> 01:19:57,688
became connected with what
the Black Panther Party was doing,

1180
01:19:57,814 --> 01:20:00,090
how it was personifying things.

1181
01:20:00,217 --> 01:20:02,573
And it was like we influenced them

1182
01:20:02,699 --> 01:20:06,251
in whatever direction
we thought that they should go.

1183
01:20:06,384 --> 01:20:11,542
I don't like to say suck up,
but they were awed by the Panthers.

1184
01:20:11,669 --> 01:20:15,631
The Panthers were somehow
confronting the white power structure

1185
01:20:15,754 --> 01:20:18,828
the way they would have liked
to have done, some of them.

1186
01:20:18,957 --> 01:20:22,430
But not all. Many of the whites
who led the Stop The Draft Week

1187
01:20:22,561 --> 01:20:24,439
could have been involved with it.

1188
01:20:24,563 --> 01:20:27,841
Many of those people who had been
in some parts of the early SDS

1189
01:20:27,967 --> 01:20:29,446
was as sceptical as I was.

1190
01:20:29,569 --> 01:20:33,247
But no one would, of course,
say any of these remarks publicly.

1191
01:20:33,373 --> 01:20:36,253
I mean, you didn't need that hassle.

1192
01:20:36,376 --> 01:20:38,572
So, what a lot of us did,

1193
01:20:38,698 --> 01:20:41,976
I think to the detriment
of the black movement, perhaps,

1194
01:20:42,102 --> 01:20:43,980
and to the left movement in general,

1195
01:20:44,104 --> 01:20:46,665
a lot of us with years
of political experience

1196
01:20:46,787 --> 01:20:49,018
and organisational skills
dropped out.

1197
01:20:49,150 --> 01:20:52,110
If not dropped out,
stepped to the side in this period.

1198
01:20:52,233 --> 01:20:52,472
Huey P Newton is the only leader
that black people should recognise!

1199
01:20:52,473 --> 01:20:56,355
Huey P Newton is the only leader
that black people should recognise!

1200
01:20:56,478 --> 01:21:01,237
A man who is willing to stand up
and face that pig,

1201
01:21:01,363 --> 01:21:03,241
and on his own terms.

1202
01:21:03,366 --> 01:21:05,801
Gun for gun if necessary.

1203
01:21:05,928 --> 01:21:08,238
This must be done!

1204
01:21:08,370 --> 01:21:10,008
You cannot sit there

1205
01:21:10,132 --> 01:21:14,014
and allow that man
to be railroaded any more.

1206
01:21:14,137 --> 01:21:20,537
You must free our leader. He must
be freed, and he will be freed.

1207
01:21:20,664 --> 01:21:24,342
Two days after the assassination
of Martin Luther King,

1208
01:21:24,468 --> 01:21:28,146
the war of nerves between the
Black Panthers and the Oakland police

1209
01:21:28,273 --> 01:21:29,308
came to a climax.

1210
01:21:29,434 --> 01:21:32,189
On April 6th 1 968,

1211
01:21:32,316 --> 01:21:35,549
a shoot-out erupted
in which Eldridge Cleaver was wounded

1212
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:37,717
and Bobby Hutton was killed.

1213
01:21:37,843 --> 01:21:40,837
Bobby Hutton
was instructed by the cops

1214
01:21:40,966 --> 01:21:46,841
to run from here to the police car,
or the area where it was,

1215
01:21:46,972 --> 01:21:50,171
and was literally shot down.

1216
01:21:50,296 --> 01:21:52,572
He was shot over ten times.

1217
01:21:52,699 --> 01:21:56,581
He had five pistol bullets
in his head.

1218
01:21:56,702 --> 01:21:59,012
A clear-cut case of murder.

1219
01:21:59,145 --> 01:22:00,977
As brother Huey P Newton says,

1220
01:22:01,108 --> 01:22:04,466
racist pig cops must stop
their wanton murder and brutality

1221
01:22:04,592 --> 01:22:06,743
or suffer the wrath
of armed black people

1222
01:22:06,874 --> 01:22:09,595
and the black communities
defending themselves.

1223
01:22:09,717 --> 01:22:12,517
Historically, in retrospect,

1224
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:17,924
those guns
were somewhat our nemesis.

1225
01:22:18,046 --> 01:22:21,803
We were never really able
to play that down.

1226
01:22:21,931 --> 01:22:23,763
The police, the media, used that.

1227
01:22:23,892 --> 01:22:29,130
We got hung up into a confrontational
thing with the police over those guns

1228
01:22:29,258 --> 01:22:32,093
that we were never really able
to live down.

1229
01:22:32,222 --> 01:22:35,261
We say, bring it on.
If you want war, let there be war.

1230
01:22:35,385 --> 01:22:37,183
This is what we say. ls that clear?

1231
01:22:37,306 --> 01:22:40,425
In other words, if he is convicted
and sentenced to death,

1232
01:22:40,550 --> 01:22:41,949
Oakland will erupt.

1233
01:22:42,072 --> 01:22:45,750
This whole country will erupt.
We're going to do everything we can

1234
01:22:45,876 --> 01:22:49,554
to see to it that the whole world
erupts. ls that clear?

1235
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:53,278
The Panthers
seemed even crazier than they were

1236
01:22:53,404 --> 01:22:56,956
because they were playing the media
and the media was loving them.

1237
01:22:57,088 --> 01:22:59,045
The media picked up their current,

1238
01:22:59,171 --> 01:23:01,892
fed the narrowest parts
of their image back to us

1239
01:23:02,013 --> 01:23:04,289
in the most dramatic, hyped terms,

1240
01:23:04,416 --> 01:23:07,889
that the Panthers themselves
wanted them to be projected.

1241
01:23:08,020 --> 01:23:09,453
It drove the police crazy.

1242
01:23:09,582 --> 01:23:13,260
They were furious and wanted
to get them all over the country,

1243
01:23:13,386 --> 01:23:15,537
and it drove some of us...

1244
01:23:15,668 --> 01:23:20,507
Well, it incited some of us
with superficial fantasies

1245
01:23:20,634 --> 01:23:25,314
of a kind of revolution
that was completely inappropriate.

1246
01:23:25,439 --> 01:23:29,117
It had nothing to do with
the actual landscape of possibility.

1247
01:23:29,243 --> 01:23:33,718
It was interesting to me
more deeply and metaphorically.

1248
01:23:33,848 --> 01:23:36,204
If that was what they were doing,

1249
01:23:36,331 --> 01:23:39,370
what was appropriate
in our community?

1250
01:23:39,494 --> 01:23:42,967
The Panthers, in a sense,
let, in my opinion,

1251
01:23:43,098 --> 01:23:44,976
white radicals off the hook,

1252
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:48,458
some white radicals, not all,
some white radicals off the hook

1253
01:23:48,584 --> 01:23:51,896
for what SNCC had challenged them
about three years earlier.

1254
01:23:52,028 --> 01:23:54,463
That was to organise
the white community.

1255
01:23:54,590 --> 01:23:58,791
They could say they supported the
Panthers as they were the vanguard.

1256
01:23:58,915 --> 01:24:01,989
They assumed the movement
could only be led by blacks.

1257
01:24:02,119 --> 01:24:06,400
They made it clear blacks would be
the group to start the revolution,

1258
01:24:06,524 --> 01:24:10,076
and that the Panthers were the army
of that black vanguard.

1259
01:25:12,115 --> 01:25:14,676
I was taken up with,

1260
01:25:14,797 --> 01:25:17,438
''Now we're not only
a protest movement,

1261
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:20,440
we're not only a movement
to end the war in Vietnam,

1262
01:25:20,564 --> 01:25:23,364
but we are a revolutionary movement.''

1263
01:25:23,487 --> 01:25:26,925
We were wrong.
It wasn't a revolutionary situation.

1264
01:25:27,050 --> 01:25:29,201
But it was a mistake.

1265
01:25:30,814 --> 01:25:33,170
Everybody can make a few mistakes.

1266
01:25:33,297 --> 01:25:37,179
And, at the time,
it had a lot of the aspects to us

1267
01:25:37,302 --> 01:25:39,100
of a revolutionary situation.

1268
01:25:39,224 --> 01:25:42,298
'68 was a real high time,
what we were doing.

1269
01:25:42,427 --> 01:25:45,307
We identified
with the student movement

1270
01:25:45,430 --> 01:25:47,740
and the large protest movement
in Paris.

1271
01:25:47,873 --> 01:25:49,545
There was the Prague Spring

1272
01:25:49,675 --> 01:25:53,353
and the feeling that revolution
was in the air, east and west,

1273
01:25:53,479 --> 01:25:55,471
capitalist and communist.

1274
01:25:55,601 --> 01:25:58,070
It was all coming apart
in a new spirit.

1275
01:25:58,204 --> 01:26:00,355
A new wave of liberation
was in the air.

1276
01:26:00,487 --> 01:26:04,039
I felt that the world was unravelling,
history had speeded up,

1277
01:26:04,171 --> 01:26:06,846
that the world
was swirling around me.

1278
01:26:06,973 --> 01:26:10,855
The movement had expanded.
The anti-war movement was immense.

1279
01:26:10,978 --> 01:26:13,733
The women's liberation movement
had begun.

1280
01:26:13,861 --> 01:26:18,381
The world was undergoing change at
a rate that I could hardly comprehend,

1281
01:26:18,507 --> 01:26:22,423
and yet I was in it and I was
part of it, and I was changing.

1282
01:26:28,197 --> 01:26:32,273
I always remember
this particular period of time,

1283
01:26:32,402 --> 01:26:35,396
because the change
was so phenomenal.

1284
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:36,843
I went to sleep one night

1285
01:26:36,966 --> 01:26:40,119
and I was a woman
who was dissatisfied

1286
01:26:40,250 --> 01:26:42,606
with my position
as a woman in society,

1287
01:26:42,733 --> 01:26:45,613
but I felt solitary
in that dissatisfaction.

1288
01:26:45,735 --> 01:26:49,811
And suddenly I wake up
and, right and left,

1289
01:26:49,940 --> 01:26:52,501
everybody is speaking about it.

1290
01:26:52,623 --> 01:26:56,938
I have women
who agree with me everywhere.

1291
01:26:57,068 --> 01:26:59,139
We start to form a sisterhood.

1292
01:26:59,270 --> 01:27:02,743
Everything in my life that has
disturbed me is being challenged.

1293
01:27:02,874 --> 01:27:07,155
Things that haven't disturbed me
before, suddenly they do.

1294
01:27:07,279 --> 01:27:12,038
When we began
to try to take a more active role

1295
01:27:12,164 --> 01:27:16,844
in steering committees
and decision-making forums

1296
01:27:16,969 --> 01:27:18,847
in the movement,

1297
01:27:18,972 --> 01:27:24,529
we began to see our comrades
resisting our input.

1298
01:27:24,658 --> 01:27:29,213
And we looked at them
and we said, ''What?''

1299
01:27:29,343 --> 01:27:33,544
''How can they do this to us?
These are our brothers.''

1300
01:27:33,668 --> 01:27:36,742
''Why aren't they interested
in what we have to say?''

1301
01:27:36,871 --> 01:27:42,348
''They're only interested in the fact
that we're always there for them.''

1302
01:27:42,477 --> 01:27:45,950
''And we always make the coffee
and we run off the leaflets

1303
01:27:46,081 --> 01:27:50,157
and we make all the telephone calls
late into the night,

1304
01:27:50,286 --> 01:27:53,964
and yet when we try to participate
on a more active level,

1305
01:27:54,089 --> 01:27:56,810
we meet resistance.''

1306
01:27:56,933 --> 01:27:59,323
What you see here
is the beginning of a movement

1307
01:27:59,456 --> 01:28:02,530
that women are human beings
and that we have equal rights.

1308
01:28:02,659 --> 01:28:06,337
We intend to go to school and have
childcare so we can go to school.

1309
01:28:06,463 --> 01:28:10,698
We want the university to run classes
that teach us about our history,

1310
01:28:10,828 --> 01:28:14,106
the same as black people
want to learn about their history.

1311
01:28:14,232 --> 01:28:17,465
That's what is happening today.
This is just the beginning.

1312
01:28:17,596 --> 01:28:19,633
One of the ways the women's movement

1313
01:28:19,757 --> 01:28:24,038
is the logical and maybe even
inevitable conclusion of the '60s

1314
01:28:24,162 --> 01:28:27,042
is that throughout the '60s
we were trying to imagine

1315
01:28:27,166 --> 01:28:30,046
how to live differently,
how to change the world.

1316
01:28:30,169 --> 01:28:33,642
The women's movement took much
from the civil-rights movement,

1317
01:28:33,772 --> 01:28:38,566
the new left, the anti-war movement,
but we brought it home.

1318
01:28:38,698 --> 01:28:42,171
We brought it into the kitchen,
we brought it into the bedroom,

1319
01:28:42,302 --> 01:28:46,982
we brought it into the most personal,
intimate aspects of people's lives.

1320
01:28:47,107 --> 01:28:49,064
It was hard to deny there.

1321
01:28:49,189 --> 01:28:51,910
It was hard to ignore those issues.

1322
01:28:52,032 --> 01:28:54,149
When I thought of revolution then,

1323
01:28:54,275 --> 01:28:59,399
the whole idea had assumed
complex, enormous dimensions.

1324
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:03,198
It didn't mean a simple change
in the institutional order.

1325
01:29:03,324 --> 01:29:08,004
It meant a coordinated change
in all the dimensions,

1326
01:29:08,130 --> 01:29:09,802
all the aspects of life.

1327
01:29:09,932 --> 01:29:12,971
How we were with ourselves,
how we were with each other.

1328
01:29:13,095 --> 01:29:16,328
This was so complex a programme,
you couldn't write it down

1329
01:29:16,459 --> 01:29:20,091
as the 1 3-point programme
of the Berkeley Revolutionary Front.

1330
01:29:20,223 --> 01:29:24,538
This was something that would take
thousands, millions of people

1331
01:29:24,667 --> 01:29:28,345
engaged all their lives in exploring
this end of it and this end of it

1332
01:29:28,472 --> 01:29:30,668
and how these ends
might fit together,

1333
01:29:30,794 --> 01:29:32,865
and it was clear by then

1334
01:29:32,997 --> 01:29:35,672
that all this exploration
was there to do.

1335
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:39,273
People had begun
each part of the exploration.

1336
01:29:39,403 --> 01:29:41,679
I forbear to list them, OK?

1337
01:29:41,806 --> 01:29:46,281
And, at the same time, it seemed
impossible. There was no time.

1338
01:29:46,411 --> 01:29:50,293
The war got worse faster,
the political activity got worse faster,

1339
01:29:50,415 --> 01:29:52,611
they were killing
more and more people.

1340
01:29:52,738 --> 01:29:56,780
Every time you placed some degree
of hope in a national leader...

1341
01:29:58,905 --> 01:30:01,181
So much life, so much death.

1342
01:30:01,308 --> 01:30:05,065
So much possibility,
so much impossibility.

1343
01:30:06,072 --> 01:30:12,027
There we were,
attempting to change national politics,

1344
01:30:12,159 --> 01:30:15,233
and found ourselves
at the Chicago Convention.

1345
01:30:15,363 --> 01:30:20,236
It changed American politics
in unpredictable ways.

1346
01:30:21,449 --> 01:30:24,363
We had not anticipated,

1347
01:30:24,492 --> 01:30:28,613
speaking for those involved
in the electoral side of politics,

1348
01:30:28,737 --> 01:30:34,533
we did not anticipate
the arbitrary exercise of authority

1349
01:30:34,663 --> 01:30:37,543
that Mayor Daley
would bring to bear in Chicago.

1350
01:30:37,667 --> 01:30:39,066
And it was phenomenal.

1351
01:30:39,189 --> 01:30:39,668
Mr Chairman,
most delegates to this convention

1352
01:30:39,669 --> 01:30:42,663
Mr Chairman,
most delegates to this convention

1353
01:30:42,792 --> 01:30:47,073
do not know that thousands
of young people are being beaten

1354
01:30:47,197 --> 01:30:49,632
in the streets of Chicago.

1355
01:30:53,885 --> 01:30:57,163
And for that reason
and that reason alone,

1356
01:30:57,287 --> 01:31:01,442
I request the suspension of the rules
for the purpose of adjournment

1357
01:31:01,572 --> 01:31:05,853
for two weeks to relocate
the convention in another city

1358
01:31:05,978 --> 01:31:08,858
of the choosing
of the Democratic National Committee

1359
01:31:08,980 --> 01:31:10,937
and the presidential candidates...

1360
01:31:11,062 --> 01:31:14,819
Wisconsin is not recognised
for that purpose!

1361
01:31:14,947 --> 01:31:19,820
There was a side of American politics
that was vicious and violent,

1362
01:31:19,953 --> 01:31:22,024
and that's what we saw in Chicago.

1363
01:31:22,154 --> 01:31:24,829
Daley rolled over
the anti-war forces,

1364
01:31:24,958 --> 01:31:29,990
and it was a destruction
of the Democratic Party.

1365
01:31:30,123 --> 01:31:33,641
It seemed impossible

1366
01:31:33,768 --> 01:31:39,052
that there could be any significant
electoral path toward ending the war

1367
01:31:39,173 --> 01:31:41,244
following the convention.

1368
01:31:41,376 --> 01:31:44,849
It seemed that what had happened
in the parks of Chicago

1369
01:31:44,980 --> 01:31:49,101
made the anti-war movement
destined for direct action

1370
01:31:49,224 --> 01:31:51,614
for quite a period of time.

1371
01:31:51,747 --> 01:31:53,864
The violence in Chicago

1372
01:31:53,989 --> 01:31:57,507
triggered confrontations on campuses
across the country.

1373
01:31:57,633 --> 01:32:01,788
Berkeley students calling for
a Third World College initiated a strike

1374
01:32:01,917 --> 01:32:05,390
which provoked daily battles
between police and protestors.

1375
01:32:05,521 --> 01:32:09,199
After eight weeks, Governor Reagan
sent in the National Guard

1376
01:32:09,326 --> 01:32:11,204
and the strike died down.

1377
01:32:11,328 --> 01:32:14,640
Eventually, an ethnic studies programme
was established,

1378
01:32:14,772 --> 01:32:18,529
but in the wake of the strike,
an atmosphere of tension remained.

1379
01:32:18,656 --> 01:32:21,650
A month later,
student and community activists

1380
01:32:21,779 --> 01:32:24,534
came together
to create People's Park.

1381
01:32:55,976 --> 01:33:00,018
I was one of those people
who believed that the counterculture

1382
01:33:00,141 --> 01:33:02,702
could be revolutionary.

1383
01:33:04,906 --> 01:33:08,584
lt's hard to talk about that
without talking about People's Park.

1384
01:33:08,710 --> 01:33:12,592
A group of people
took some corporate land

1385
01:33:12,714 --> 01:33:17,394
owned by the University of California
that was a parking lot,

1386
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:19,192
turned it into a park

1387
01:33:19,322 --> 01:33:23,000
and then said, ''We're using the land
better than you used it,

1388
01:33:23,125 --> 01:33:25,960
and it's ours.''

1389
01:33:26,089 --> 01:33:29,322
For a brief moment in history,
in People's Park,

1390
01:33:29,453 --> 01:33:33,131
the counterculture
and political activists

1391
01:33:33,257 --> 01:33:35,135
had a magical fusion.

1392
01:33:36,220 --> 01:33:39,738
It was a way of looking
at the future. lt was utopian.

1393
01:33:39,864 --> 01:33:44,737
It was a way of saying,
''lf we had control of our lives,

1394
01:33:44,870 --> 01:33:47,260
this is what it would look like.''

1395
01:34:05,451 --> 01:34:08,126
In a down-to-earth way,

1396
01:34:08,255 --> 01:34:13,732
we were showing in our very activity
the image of a new society.

1397
01:34:13,860 --> 01:34:17,697
Our job is to form a counterculture,

1398
01:34:17,825 --> 01:34:22,778
a more rural culture,
a more decentralised culture,

1399
01:34:22,911 --> 01:34:25,871
to develop counter-values
of cooperation,

1400
01:34:25,994 --> 01:34:29,272
of a production for use
rather than a production for profit,

1401
01:34:29,397 --> 01:34:32,870
develop that culture in hope
that that culture would be

1402
01:34:33,001 --> 01:34:37,635
in revolutionary contradiction
to a bourgeois culture.

1403
01:34:37,767 --> 01:34:40,681
And that we should view ourselves
as revolutionaries

1404
01:34:40,809 --> 01:34:44,487
but really as founding mothers
and fathers of this counterculture.

1405
01:34:44,614 --> 01:34:46,412
I can almost convince myself now!

1406
01:34:46,536 --> 01:34:50,578
As I see it, the great hope
implicit in the People's Park

1407
01:34:50,701 --> 01:34:53,854
is that in our leisure time,
so to speak,

1408
01:34:53,984 --> 01:34:56,135
we will make the social revolution.

1409
01:34:56,266 --> 01:35:00,342
Property is not a thing
to keep men apart and at war,

1410
01:35:00,471 --> 01:35:04,752
but rather a medium by which
men can come together to play,

1411
01:35:04,876 --> 01:35:06,947
a people's park.

1412
01:35:07,078 --> 01:35:13,079
People's Park managed to focus
all of the frustrations

1413
01:35:13,205 --> 01:35:17,406
as well as some of the ideals
of the '60s.

1414
01:35:17,530 --> 01:35:19,806
There was a belief
in the environment,

1415
01:35:19,932 --> 01:35:22,732
a belief in the participation
of ordinary people

1416
01:35:22,855 --> 01:35:24,527
in political decision-making,

1417
01:35:24,657 --> 01:35:27,332
a belief that a lot of things
ought to count

1418
01:35:27,460 --> 01:35:29,178
that traditionally don't count

1419
01:35:29,302 --> 01:35:33,218
when they're caught up in government
and university bureaucracy.

1420
01:35:33,346 --> 01:35:34,495
There was all of that.

1421
01:35:34,628 --> 01:35:38,146
But the fact remains that
I believe the People's Park incident

1422
01:35:38,272 --> 01:35:41,311
was extremely cynical
on the part of the demonstrators.

1423
01:35:41,436 --> 01:35:43,154
They wanted a confrontation.

1424
01:35:43,278 --> 01:35:48,037
What mattered was getting people
out in the streets, demonstrating.

1425
01:35:48,162 --> 01:35:51,840
Roger Hinds and the regents
and Ronald Reagan

1426
01:35:51,967 --> 01:35:54,243
can't allow this to go on.

1427
01:35:54,370 --> 01:35:56,966
If there's one liberated territory,

1428
01:35:57,093 --> 01:36:00,850
people may get the idea there
could be other liberated territories.

1429
01:36:00,976 --> 01:36:04,733
The park issue is not the issue.

1430
01:36:04,861 --> 01:36:12,058
The issue is, ''We must have
a confrontation throughout the summer.''

1431
01:36:12,188 --> 01:36:14,623
They were
out of confrontation issues.

1432
01:36:14,751 --> 01:36:17,790
And as soon as you give them a park,

1433
01:36:17,915 --> 01:36:20,350
they'll dream up another confrontation.

1434
01:36:20,478 --> 01:36:24,190
We have been invaded by people
outside of the state,

1435
01:36:24,322 --> 01:36:28,000
outside of the cities,
we have been invaded by militants.

1436
01:36:29,127 --> 01:36:31,483
This is... We're in a revolution,

1437
01:36:31,610 --> 01:36:35,288
and the only thing, don't ever say
we're going into a revolution.

1438
01:36:35,414 --> 01:36:38,772
We're in a revolution!
Now the question is, who will win it?

1439
01:36:38,897 --> 01:36:42,688
When Jesus disrupted the foreign
recruiters, his followers said...

1440
01:36:42,822 --> 01:36:46,180
''Power to the people.
Out, demons, out.''

1441
01:36:46,306 --> 01:36:48,662
I declare this place decontaminated

1442
01:36:48,789 --> 01:36:53,070
from poisons, chains and lies,
from the abomination that defiles.

1443
01:36:53,193 --> 01:36:56,871
The demons have returned to
the nothingness from which they came.

1444
01:36:56,997 --> 01:37:00,196
Earth, water, air and fire,
witness our liberation.

1445
01:37:00,321 --> 01:37:03,554
This property is private.

1446
01:37:03,685 --> 01:37:06,360
You are now trespassing.

1447
01:37:06,487 --> 01:37:10,802
Unless you leave,
you will be arrested for trespassing.

1448
01:37:12,053 --> 01:37:16,095
If they didn't want the park, they
should've stopped us when we started,

1449
01:37:16,218 --> 01:37:19,736
and not let us work on it every day
and then just take it away.

1450
01:37:21,063 --> 01:37:23,498
lt's their park now. What can we do?

1451
01:37:24,787 --> 01:37:26,779
I have a suggestion.

1452
01:37:26,910 --> 01:37:31,065
Let's go down to the People's Park,
because we are the people!

1453
01:37:31,794 --> 01:37:35,426
We want the park! We want the park!

1454
01:38:32,501 --> 01:38:33,854
Here they come.

1455
01:39:40,574 --> 01:39:40,733
Those people told you
for days in advance

1456
01:39:40,735 --> 01:39:44,697
Those people told you
for days in advance

1457
01:39:44,818 --> 01:39:48,939
that if the university sought
to go ahead with that construction

1458
01:39:49,063 --> 01:39:53,857
on that property, they would
physically destroy the university.

1459
01:39:53,989 --> 01:39:56,630
Governor, we offered to negotiate
many times.

1460
01:39:56,751 --> 01:40:00,303
Negotiate? What is to negotiate?
What is...?

1461
01:40:00,435 --> 01:40:05,035
Wait a minute. On that issue, don't
you simply explain to these students

1462
01:40:05,161 --> 01:40:08,793
that the university has a piece
of property that it bought

1463
01:40:08,924 --> 01:40:11,120
for future construction of the campus

1464
01:40:11,247 --> 01:40:15,038
and it was now going ahead with
the plan? What do you mean, negotiate?

1465
01:40:15,172 --> 01:40:17,243
Governor Reagan, the time has passed

1466
01:40:17,374 --> 01:40:20,049
when the university
can just ride roughshod

1467
01:40:20,177 --> 01:40:23,251
over the desires of the majority
of its student body.

1468
01:40:23,380 --> 01:40:25,656
The university
is a public institution,

1469
01:40:25,783 --> 01:40:28,857
an important institution
for all of its own community

1470
01:40:28,987 --> 01:40:31,263
and for the Berkeley community
around it.

1471
01:40:31,389 --> 01:40:34,349
All of it began the first time
some of you who know better

1472
01:40:34,473 --> 01:40:36,271
and are old enough to know better

1473
01:40:36,394 --> 01:40:38,863
let young people think
that they had the right

1474
01:40:38,997 --> 01:40:40,954
to choose the laws they would obey,

1475
01:40:41,080 --> 01:40:44,553
as long as they were doing it
in the name of social protest.

1476
01:40:50,049 --> 01:40:54,125
When the fence went up, the whole
experience of People's Park changed.

1477
01:40:54,254 --> 01:40:56,929
Governor Reagan
brought in the National Guard,

1478
01:40:57,057 --> 01:40:59,128
the city was occupied for a month,

1479
01:40:59,260 --> 01:41:02,938
and what happened is, the worst
aspects of the movement emerged.

1480
01:41:03,063 --> 01:41:06,216
People did things
that were totally counterproductive.

1481
01:41:06,347 --> 01:41:10,343
They tried to provoke the National Guard
into fixing their bayonets.

1482
01:41:10,472 --> 01:41:13,147
They tried to cause skirmishes
on the campus.

1483
01:41:13,275 --> 01:41:16,155
I found it possible
to resist the feeling,

1484
01:41:16,277 --> 01:41:18,075
the collective hallucination,

1485
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:21,478
that we were involved
in a revolutionary struggle.

1486
01:41:21,603 --> 01:41:26,237
But there was one moment when
I became immersed in that feeling.

1487
01:41:26,369 --> 01:41:29,967
There was a peaceful demonstration
on Sproul Plaza

1488
01:41:30,092 --> 01:41:33,086
denouncing the university's
overreaction to the park,

1489
01:41:33,216 --> 01:41:35,367
the police brutality
towards students,

1490
01:41:35,499 --> 01:41:38,811
the National Guard on campus,
occupying the city.

1491
01:41:38,943 --> 01:41:42,221
My boyfriend and I and a friend of mine

1492
01:41:42,346 --> 01:41:45,624
went down to the plaza
to hear the rally,

1493
01:41:45,749 --> 01:41:46,943
and as we got there,

1494
01:41:47,071 --> 01:41:50,349
we realised that the police
were letting people into the plaza

1495
01:41:50,475 --> 01:41:52,592
but they were not letting people out.

1496
01:41:52,718 --> 01:41:56,396
My friend, by that time, had already
gone through the police lines

1497
01:41:56,521 --> 01:42:00,199
and I motioned for her to come back,
and they wouldn't let her out.

1498
01:42:00,325 --> 01:42:03,923
Pigs off campus! Pigs off campus!

1499
01:42:06,813 --> 01:42:09,773
Killers off campus!
Killers off campus!

1500
01:42:09,895 --> 01:42:12,570
..requesting you all
to leave the plaza.

1501
01:42:12,699 --> 01:42:17,823
If you don't leave, you're going
to be shot in the next five minutes.

1502
01:42:17,945 --> 01:42:21,623
I started hearing
the sounds of a helicopter,

1503
01:42:21,748 --> 01:42:25,744
and it came closer and closer
and the sound got louder and louder

1504
01:42:25,873 --> 01:42:29,185
and suddenly the helicopter
swooped over the whole campus,

1505
01:42:29,317 --> 01:42:31,309
over all the students, and I thought,

1506
01:42:31,439 --> 01:42:34,000
''We're going to be shot at.
We're the Vietcong.''

1507
01:43:01,751 --> 01:43:05,269
Everybody on the outside
of the police line was running

1508
01:43:05,396 --> 01:43:07,274
to try to get away from the gas.

1509
01:43:07,398 --> 01:43:10,916
Everybody on the inside of the police
line was trying to get out.

1510
01:43:11,042 --> 01:43:14,594
And the police were beating people
as they tried to get out.

1511
01:43:14,725 --> 01:43:18,880
We went back to Kroeber Hall
and waited for my friend to show up.

1512
01:43:19,010 --> 01:43:22,892
She'd been through the mill. She had
been throwing up, it was nausea gas.

1513
01:43:23,015 --> 01:43:25,530
So we drove up to the rose garden.

1514
01:43:25,658 --> 01:43:29,939
We were standing there, looking out
across the roses and the campus,

1515
01:43:30,062 --> 01:43:34,024
and there were still helicopters
circling around.

1516
01:43:36,229 --> 01:43:39,907
She looked at me and said, ''l can't
stand this. l'm going to get out.''

1517
01:43:40,033 --> 01:43:42,913
I said, ''l think you're right.
I think it's all over.''

1518
01:43:43,036 --> 01:43:46,998
''l don't think we can stay here any
more.'' lt was a poignant moment.

1519
01:43:47,121 --> 01:43:49,636
And a year later, we were all gone.

1520
01:43:49,764 --> 01:43:51,801
We all felt very defeated.

1521
01:43:51,927 --> 01:43:56,686
It was a horrible experience
to gas students at a peaceful rally.

1522
01:43:57,532 --> 01:43:59,204
And it was one reason

1523
01:43:59,334 --> 01:44:04,412
why people began to feel that we had
to reassert what we really stood for,

1524
01:44:04,540 --> 01:44:08,695
that we really had to protest the park

1525
01:44:08,824 --> 01:44:10,975
in a dignified and peaceful way,

1526
01:44:11,107 --> 01:44:14,545
and recapture the original spirit
of the park.

1527
01:44:15,432 --> 01:44:19,189
And that led to
the Memorial Day march.

1528
01:45:15,496 --> 01:45:17,727
We'll get People's Park
back eventually.

1529
01:45:17,859 --> 01:45:20,135
Everybody who's ever done
any hitchhiking

1530
01:45:20,262 --> 01:45:23,940
knows that basically we can't lose.
When you sit out and hitchhike,

1531
01:45:24,066 --> 01:45:25,944
in the front seat are the parents

1532
01:45:26,068 --> 01:45:30,668
and they give you this real scared,
contemptuous look as they drive by,

1533
01:45:30,793 --> 01:45:35,154
but then, in the back seat, as they
drive away, you see the kids going...

1534
01:45:36,199 --> 01:45:39,672
We got the kids on our side
and we can't lose. We just can't lose.

1535
01:45:39,803 --> 01:45:42,683
When you're in a mass movement
to change society,

1536
01:45:42,806 --> 01:45:48,090
when you're in this experience
of this democracy breaking out,

1537
01:45:48,212 --> 01:45:52,493
you don't want it to end.
You want the storm to continue.

1538
01:45:52,616 --> 01:45:58,298
You want to keep that sense of change
and overwhelming power

1539
01:45:58,423 --> 01:46:00,141
that one gets from the ocean.

1540
01:46:00,265 --> 01:46:03,738
You might not be able
to keep the rowboat straight or up,

1541
01:46:03,869 --> 01:46:07,227
but you don't want the storm to die.

1542
01:46:07,352 --> 01:46:10,825
There was no vision,
no articulate philosophy,

1543
01:46:10,957 --> 01:46:14,235
no conception of social organisation
and social change.

1544
01:46:14,361 --> 01:46:18,243
What there were
were a series of emotional moments,

1545
01:46:18,364 --> 01:46:22,042
a series of passions, a series
of desperately important issues.

1546
01:46:22,169 --> 01:46:24,559
But you can't beat something
with nothing,

1547
01:46:24,691 --> 01:46:28,164
and if you're going to fight
this kind of long cultural battle,

1548
01:46:28,296 --> 01:46:29,695
you are bound to lose

1549
01:46:29,817 --> 01:46:33,608
if you don't have a coherent,
articulate, well-worked-out vision

1550
01:46:33,741 --> 01:46:36,576
of what you're trying to do
and that they didn't have.

1551
01:46:36,704 --> 01:46:39,584
We had taken what we had
as far as we could go.

1552
01:46:39,708 --> 01:46:41,745
I think that it's important

1553
01:46:41,870 --> 01:46:44,944
not to lose sight
of what that movement accomplished.

1554
01:46:45,073 --> 01:46:49,354
That is, it was part of the struggle
for civil rights.

1555
01:46:49,478 --> 01:46:52,119
It was part of the movement
in this country

1556
01:46:52,241 --> 01:46:54,312
that broke down
the Jim Crow barriers

1557
01:46:54,444 --> 01:46:58,076
and changed the caste relationships

1558
01:46:58,207 --> 01:47:01,360
of blacks and other minorities
in our society.

1559
01:47:01,491 --> 01:47:07,766
It was part of the movement
that liberalised American culture.

1560
01:47:07,899 --> 01:47:10,095
It was part of the movement
that gave way

1561
01:47:10,220 --> 01:47:13,498
to the ideas of women's equality
and women's liberation.

1562
01:47:13,624 --> 01:47:16,459
It was part of a movement

1563
01:47:16,588 --> 01:47:20,425
that ultimately made it impossible

1564
01:47:20,552 --> 01:47:24,628
to carry out so blatantly the kind
of imperialistic foreign policy

1565
01:47:24,756 --> 01:47:29,276
that characterised
the period after World War Two.

1566
01:47:29,401 --> 01:47:34,160
American society was profoundly
changed by the movements of the '60s.

1567
01:47:34,287 --> 01:47:40,448
In the '60s, we came
at a certain point in the Cold War

1568
01:47:40,573 --> 01:47:43,647
to reject the ideologies
of both sides,

1569
01:47:43,777 --> 01:47:48,411
and our declaration of freedom
was a political freedom,

1570
01:47:48,543 --> 01:47:50,739
but it had a larger dimension,

1571
01:47:50,864 --> 01:47:53,858
that is, the freedom of imagination.

1572
01:47:56,150 --> 01:47:59,030
Having gained the freedom
to see the world freshly

1573
01:47:59,154 --> 01:48:01,430
and the ability to act for change,

1574
01:48:01,557 --> 01:48:04,835
we carried what we'd learned
into the rest of our lives.

1575
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:08,034
From personal issues
to planetary concerns,

1576
01:48:08,163 --> 01:48:11,316
we continued to explore
the potential for change.

1577
01:48:11,447 --> 01:48:16,161
And as we watch activists for human
rights and democracy around the world

1578
01:48:16,292 --> 01:48:18,443
challenge the powers that be,

1579
01:48:18,574 --> 01:48:22,650
we know that each generation
has its chance to make things change,

1580
01:48:22,779 --> 01:48:26,137
and that no generation
can do it alone.

1581
01:48:42,001 --> 01:48:43,913
We shall live in peace!

1582
01:57:14,075 --> 01:57:16,032
