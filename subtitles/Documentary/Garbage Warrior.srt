00:01:04,296 --> 00:01:06,648
For 35 years architect Michael Reynolds
has been experimenting

3
00:01:06,693 --> 00:01:10,218
with radically sustainable living
in New Mexico´s desert...

4
00:01:14,175 --> 00:01:18,213
he believes that progress evolves
through making mistakes...

5
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,669
but not everyone sees it his way.

6
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:34,140
I feel like I´m in a herd of buffalo

7
00:01:34,792 --> 00:01:37,391
and they are all stampeding toward
thousand foot drop off,

8
00:01:37,424 --> 00:01:39,354
and they are just
running over the edge.

9
00:01:39,389 --> 00:01:42,158
And I´m in that herd. And I´m like:

10
00:01:42,173 --> 00:01:46,630
"I´m not going there.
I´m not going down that way."

11
00:01:48,486 --> 00:01:50,408
So I have to somehow

12
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:54,883
affect the whole herd so that they
will take a left turn or right turn

13
00:01:55,378 --> 00:01:58,135
and not go off this edge.

14
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,230
And so if humanity takes
the planet down the tubes,

15
00:02:02,231 --> 00:02:03,231
I´m dead!

16
00:02:05,837 --> 00:02:07,819
I´m trying to save my ass.

17
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:10,773
And that is a powerfull force.

18
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:14,225
GARBAGE WARRIOR

19
00:02:43,948 --> 00:02:45,320
Wonderful, inventive,...

20
00:02:45,355 --> 00:02:51,512
unique person, who lookes at life
in a different way for the most people.

21
00:02:53,288 --> 00:02:55,080
He is always full of ideas.

22
00:02:55,536 --> 00:02:56,766
- Chris, Mike´s wife -

23
00:02:57,388 --> 00:02:59,800
In fact when Mike becomes quiet,
we know that there is an idea hatching.

24
00:03:00,536 --> 00:03:06,505
Ahead of his time, unusual, likes
to do things his own way, stubborn.

25
00:03:16,381 --> 00:03:21,059
I was raised as a baptist,
no dancing, no drinking, no gambling.

26
00:03:21,574 --> 00:03:23,591
So I got the hell out of Dodge!

27
00:03:32,615 --> 00:03:35,004
I went to architectural school in the
university of Cincinnati,

28
00:03:35,394 --> 00:03:38,088
took all the architectural courses,
got my degree

29
00:03:38,922 --> 00:03:48,632
and I began right then to think that
architecture as it stood then was worthless.

30
00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:53,997
Had nothing to do with the planet,
had barelly to do anything with the people,

31
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:55,927
and what they needed.

32
00:03:58,899 --> 00:04:00,246
I love to draw, I love to build.

33
00:04:01,243 --> 00:04:05,541
But the profession of architecture
is nowhere near addressing

34
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,695
the issues that we are faced with.

35
00:04:09,638 --> 00:04:15,197
They have the opportunity to really guide us
and take us to where we need to go

36
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:18,049
and they are not.
They are taking us where we don´t need to go.

37
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:20,870
We are running out of oil,
we are running out of water...

38
00:04:21,648 --> 00:04:22,904
We have global warming.

39
00:04:23,345 --> 00:04:25,003
The population is expanding.

40
00:04:25,868 --> 00:04:28,271
For many reasons, we don´t have time.

41
00:04:33,299 --> 00:04:37,605
We need to be doing something now,
tomorrow morning.

42
00:04:41,996 --> 00:04:44,814
Figured your black water under control?
- "Yeah!" - All right.

43
00:04:49,825 --> 00:04:51,458
Is that working like we wanted it to?

44
00:04:52,176 --> 00:04:54,790
I do like three on each of these tops...

45
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:02,755
I started all this thinking
with quality of life in mind.

46
00:05:04,298 --> 00:05:06,345
We are talking about survival now!

47
00:05:12,806 --> 00:05:14,173
It´s all good.

48
00:05:17,254 --> 00:05:21,441
So it´s 24,5 with no sun and power being used.

49
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,892
That´s the final overflow that just
goes to the septic of this.

50
00:05:32,586 --> 00:05:40,507
But the final overflow for all the planners...
Yes, straight to the septic.

51
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:51,372
We know that in the future we are rendering
this planet damn near uninhabitable.

52
00:05:52,806 --> 00:05:55,572
So as we move closer toward that,

53
00:05:56,249 --> 00:05:57,339
we are trying to devise

54
00:05:57,374 --> 00:06:02,104
a method of living that allows people
to take care of themselves.

55
00:06:07,431 --> 00:06:08,943
The Fénix

56
00:06:11,176 --> 00:06:12,592
There is nothing coming into this house!

57
00:06:12,593 --> 00:06:17,549
No powerlines, no gas lines, no sewage
lines going out, no water lines coming in.

58
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:19,453
No energy being used.

59
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,363
We are setting on 6 000 gallons of water,

60
00:06:23,398 --> 00:06:26,957
food growing, sewage internalized,

61
00:06:27,483 --> 00:06:29,663
70 degree spaced all year round.

62
00:06:32,863 --> 00:06:34,272
What this kind of houses are doing,

63
00:06:34,273 --> 00:06:38,347
is taking every aspect of your life and
putting it into your own hands.

64
00:06:40,332 --> 00:06:44,756
A family of 4 could totally survive here
without even going to the store.

65
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:51,361
So that whole area is going
to be fruit production,

66
00:06:51,443 --> 00:06:53,316
with birds and insects flying around.

67
00:06:55,613 --> 00:06:58,566
Then out here it´s going to be
goats, chickens and ducks.

68
00:07:01,157 --> 00:07:02,134
So this will be literally,

69
00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:03,135
an amazon jungle...

70
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,326
with 20 foot tall trees

71
00:07:05,327 --> 00:07:10,669
and little platforms up there where you
can hang out with trees, birds, parrots,

72
00:07:10,704 --> 00:07:14,524
canaries, you know, bugs, bees, butterflies...

73
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:21,746
It´s a direction for humanity, really.

74
00:07:23,372 --> 00:07:27,535
I´ve been doing it for 30 years and I think
I´m starting to scratch the surface

75
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:33,857
of what is available in this goldmine,
that we are starting to penetrate.

76
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,857
Solar 1019,
the worlds powerful solar radio station...

77
00:08:02,311 --> 00:08:05,151
Mikes biggest obsession is work.

78
00:08:06,941 --> 00:08:08,225
Definatelly work.

79
00:08:09,624 --> 00:08:12,349
And I wake up in the middle of the night
to get a drink of water,

80
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:16,772
and there is Mike lying there.
Staring into space...

81
00:08:34,032 --> 00:08:37,276
I´m always dreaming about a room,
that I´m working on, or whatever.

82
00:08:40,499 --> 00:08:42,053
I was sleeping, I had a dream...

83
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:47,328
And I saw this seashell type shape
that you would walk into...

84
00:08:47,768 --> 00:08:50,117
But then I took the sketch to Ted

85
00:08:50,714 --> 00:08:54,319
and told him, I just dreamed this Ted.
And here is what I´m trying to get,

86
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,175
and I made pictures and everything...

87
00:08:56,636 --> 00:09:00,034
And then we talked about how to
do it and Ted made it happen.

88
00:09:04,052 --> 00:09:07,626
And I take my dreams done,
and I make my dreams happen.

89
00:09:07,775 --> 00:09:10,554
And it becomes their dreams too.

90
00:09:46,265 --> 00:09:48,006
And the bottles,
they are jewels, you know.

91
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:50,590
This is garbage.

92
00:09:51,862 --> 00:09:55,444
And it comes out like stain glass jewels.

93
00:10:03,044 --> 00:10:05,663
My dad saved everything.

94
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:12,159
Mayonnaise jars, milk cartons, keys;
he saved everything in the basement.

95
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,818
And you go down there and every mayonnaise
jar that we´d ever used was down there.

96
00:10:17,047 --> 00:10:21,006
He didn´t know what to do with them.
He didn´t really have uses for them;

97
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:24,025
he just said,
that´s too good to throw away.

98
00:10:49,903 --> 00:10:52,139
Thumb House, built 1972

99
00:10:57,322 --> 00:11:00,451
This is the first house
built out of beer cans.

100
00:11:00,533 --> 00:11:02,740
It´s called the Thumb House,
because it looks like a thumb.

101
00:11:04,046 --> 00:11:08,535
So it´s actually in a good condition,
as any the ones after it.

102
00:11:08,992 --> 00:11:12,975
There you can see... that´s the beer can
building blocks right there.

103
00:11:16,847 --> 00:11:18,940
We made houses with bricks in my world.

104
00:11:19,744 --> 00:11:21,664
So I made a brick out of cans!

105
00:11:21,965 --> 00:11:24,993
Wired together with little
pieces of foil for reflectors.

106
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:30,958
I built two or three houses this way and
went on to just using cans by themselves.

107
00:11:41,113 --> 00:11:43,457
It´s a solid wall, 35 years later.

108
00:11:47,094 --> 00:11:50,710
First hint of the beginning of
orienting windows to the south.

109
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:53,093
I was just getting aware of the fact,

110
00:11:53,319 --> 00:11:59,722
that you can get some solar gain
into a room by doing this.

111
00:12:08,935 --> 00:12:11,479
From doing what I´ve been
doing as long as I have...

112
00:12:11,838 --> 00:12:16,180
Seeing that cities are real close
to dying or falling apart

113
00:12:16,518 --> 00:12:18,725
because of the
infrastructure failing...

114
00:12:19,024 --> 00:12:22,996
There are just dangerous areas of chaos
that can´t support themselves any longer.

115
00:12:23,136 --> 00:12:27,024
So I see them getting abandoned,
and I see, beyond that, ...

116
00:12:27,716 --> 00:12:32,034
people going back to the cities
just to mine out the goods.

117
00:12:39,915 --> 00:12:44,402
What else do we have on this planet, that we
throw away and we have it in abundance?

118
00:12:45,195 --> 00:12:46,229
Tyres!

119
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:52,430
Tyres were resilient and thermal and
super strong and didn´t take cement

120
00:12:52,811 --> 00:12:56,541
and you can built a whole tyre wall
with dirt and a shovel and tyres.

121
00:12:57,136 --> 00:12:58,712
He is totally obsessed.

122
00:12:59,455 --> 00:13:06,914
He is very one pointed, very single minded
and has very strong focus for certain things.

123
00:13:10,317 --> 00:13:12,959
And we beat the earth into
the tyres with sledgehammers.

124
00:13:13,388 --> 00:13:17,172
And it was really tight.
It was like a compacted 90% brick.

125
00:13:18,313 --> 00:13:20,796
In the early 70s they were
talking about solar

126
00:13:20,888 --> 00:13:23,325
and trying to store
thermal mass in houses.

127
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:26,588
And I´m getting a bit
of a consciousness of thermal mass.

128
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:28,452
Beating dirt into tyres

129
00:13:28,877 --> 00:13:29,894
was mass!

130
00:13:29,929 --> 00:13:31,730
Mass holds temperature!

131
00:13:32,675 --> 00:13:38,024
And I´m like "Oh, my god."
This thermo mass thing is intense.

132
00:13:39,164 --> 00:13:41,527
I mean, it´s like...wow

133
00:13:41,528 --> 00:13:43,199
Man, it´s powerfull!

134
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:52,476
Thermal mass, once you have
established it around you...

135
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:54,722
It doesn´t go away.

136
00:13:58,284 --> 00:14:01,292
This is the first one that
we actually called an "earthship".

137
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,360
I needed a house...

138
00:14:04,111 --> 00:14:06,437
because I was just getting married to Chris.

139
00:14:07,594 --> 00:14:11,730
And here it is 20 years later and we
are still living in it, because it works.

140
00:14:18,006 --> 00:14:20,494
Very simple, easy to build.

141
00:14:23,421 --> 00:14:25,380
Thats all beer cans plastered over.

142
00:14:26,764 --> 00:14:28,874
There is no doors, there is no wall.

143
00:14:29,456 --> 00:14:32,844
It´s basically a series of "U" shaped rooms.

144
00:14:33,778 --> 00:14:35,532
All conected with the green house.

145
00:14:35,567 --> 00:14:37,287
All of the glass is facing the sun...

146
00:14:37,825 --> 00:14:41,397
And the low winter sun comes
right in and floods the house.

147
00:14:41,398 --> 00:14:46,360
And it´s absorbed into the massive walls
of the tyres. And just stored there.

148
00:14:46,896 --> 00:14:47,902
Just heating wise...

149
00:14:47,937 --> 00:14:51,383
There is just no heating bill.
There is no heating or cooling bill here.

150
00:14:51,435 --> 00:14:55,244
We have a fireplace.
We use it on Christmass. Thats it.

151
00:14:59,147 --> 00:15:01,285
It´s a big deal to get ready for winter here.

152
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:08,242
Because you can die. Because it gets 30 below,
even 35 below zero Fahrenheit here.

153
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:11,299
Your tongue can freeze to your lips
if you aren´t carefull.

154
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:12,820
It gets that cold...

155
00:15:12,822 --> 00:15:18,915
And we have been living here almost
20 years with no heating system.

156
00:15:19,516 --> 00:15:22,999
That takes a huge bit of stress
out of a person,

157
00:15:23,136 --> 00:15:26,373
but it also takes it out of the planet.

158
00:16:05,821 --> 00:16:08,939
Castle Compound, Taos
built 1976 - 1986

159
00:16:09,404 --> 00:16:15,869
This is a compound
that we started working on 30 years ago.

160
00:16:20,565 --> 00:16:22,816
This is like a little testing site, really.

161
00:16:29,315 --> 00:16:32,469
This whole decade of work here
was just evolution.

162
00:16:39,379 --> 00:16:43,319
You couldn´t worry about what it looked
like, you just wanted it to work.

163
00:16:44,164 --> 00:16:46,081
Then we built a giant wind mill here.

164
00:16:46,862 --> 00:16:49,216
Thats being taken off of the building now.

165
00:16:49,886 --> 00:16:51,723
And it worked so well...

166
00:16:51,758 --> 00:16:55,923
That we had to build a building around
it because it was about to take off.

167
00:16:56,743 --> 00:16:59,057
It made a huge amount of power.

168
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:07,245
So all of these buildings just
represent trial experiments...

169
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,787
And a learning situation.

170
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,766
That´s the first building right there...

171
00:17:33,801 --> 00:17:37,691
They call it the grandfather of earthships,
because it was the first building

172
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,260
that really tried to put it all together.

173
00:17:40,294 --> 00:17:44,078
This is the first absolutely off of all
grids building that we did,

174
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:46,469
and maybe the first one
that was ever done.

175
00:17:47,303 --> 00:17:50,050
I mean it´s definitely wild shape...

176
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,771
Made to take advantage of the wind.

177
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:57,502
This was the first place where I put

178
00:17:58,005 --> 00:18:01,531
wind, solar, greenhouse, garbage building...

179
00:18:02,031 --> 00:18:05,867
everything together in one building.
And this is what it ended up looking like.

180
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:10,350
Everything was intense. Everything about what
we were doing, in the buildings, in the life.

181
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:14,989
It was just like absolutely striking
intense the whole time.

182
00:18:16,547 --> 00:18:18,849
People would come out here and
they´d never wanna leave.

183
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:24,131
It was a time of magic.
So that I can say.

184
00:18:27,303 --> 00:18:29,189
Living in that building...

185
00:18:29,224 --> 00:18:31,076
I mean, this is like 25 years ago.

186
00:18:31,499 --> 00:18:33,002
I had my own power,

187
00:18:33,037 --> 00:18:34,601
I had food growing.

188
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,621
I didn´t need heat.

189
00:18:36,993 --> 00:18:43,697
I was like: "Jesus Christ,
I am free, I am absolutely free!"

190
00:18:53,196 --> 00:18:55,111
The state of mind that that put you in.

191
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:57,927
You can get up in the morning
and you own your life.

192
00:18:59,997 --> 00:19:03,491
Well I can do whatever I want,
because I don´t have to do anything

193
00:19:03,562 --> 00:19:05,032
to stay alive.

194
00:19:08,743 --> 00:19:12,461
We have the potential to enhance the planet.

195
00:19:12,656 --> 00:19:16,553
Trees enhance the planet,
though people could go a way further.

196
00:19:17,092 --> 00:19:21,201
I see the Earth glowing like a sun
just from what people do to it.

197
00:19:21,236 --> 00:19:25,041
Just making the Earth sing, like music.

198
00:19:25,288 --> 00:19:26,439
Rather then...

199
00:19:26,736 --> 00:19:30,213
Shit floating in rivers
and chemicals in the air...

200
00:19:30,525 --> 00:19:31,965
and stuff like that.

201
00:19:33,687 --> 00:19:38,758
I have always thought that if you
are doing something right for people...

202
00:19:39,691 --> 00:19:40,414
they´ll find you.

203
00:19:41,768 --> 00:19:44,638
We put it out there in a website,
we wrote books that got out there,

204
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,222
of course the magazine articles
and everything; got out there...

205
00:19:47,223 --> 00:19:50,644
and it attracted people
that ended up working for us,

206
00:19:51,469 --> 00:19:52,772
they became our crew.

207
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,791
It´s not so much an adoption,
it´s more like ... a punishment, maybe.

208
00:20:02,711 --> 00:20:05,062
Our parasitic relationship, one of the two.

209
00:20:05,129 --> 00:20:09,017
Well, whatever it is, we can´t get rid
of it, so we are all trying to live with it.

210
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:13,875
I found Phil at a bus station crying.
I took him in under my wing.

211
00:20:14,263 --> 00:20:15,753
And here he is.

212
00:20:16,885 --> 00:20:21,004
Look at this drawing...
I couldn´t built a damn thing from that.

213
00:20:31,778 --> 00:20:33,185
Why am I doing this?

214
00:20:33,944 --> 00:20:35,280
For money:)

215
00:20:37,481 --> 00:20:40,268
Are you gonna get rich doing this?
- No!

216
00:20:40,723 --> 00:20:45,726
He probably looks at us as sons and
we look at him like a stepdad.

217
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,532
That you can hang out and party with.

218
00:20:47,535 --> 00:20:49,450
And I am always telling Mike...

219
00:20:49,485 --> 00:20:54,466
that you are like a freak magnet, he attracts
the weirdest people, the weirdest clients.

220
00:20:57,781 --> 00:21:00,964
To put the crew together
to build a community for themselves...

221
00:21:01,474 --> 00:21:03,484
you can´t get any better than that.

222
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:09,548
So when we set up this community,
we designated 10 acres

223
00:21:10,434 --> 00:21:14,756
and they all got their memberships,
which turned into actual building lots.

224
00:21:16,852 --> 00:21:18,466
Well we all payed the same amount,

225
00:21:18,748 --> 00:21:22,046
and we all drew a number out of a hat,
and we got the lot that we got.

226
00:21:25,754 --> 00:21:27,969
I was so happy to just
own a small piece of land,

227
00:21:28,012 --> 00:21:31,113
I didn´t even know how big
it was until we got here.

228
00:21:31,148 --> 00:21:34,160
I just knew it went from
over there to over there.

229
00:21:34,275 --> 00:21:36,251
And I like put my house in the middle of it.

230
00:21:36,286 --> 00:21:41,869
It was fair. It was equal. The richer person
couldn´t afford the better lot, you know?

231
00:21:45,829 --> 00:21:50,608
There were people that got in
for very very affordable prices.

232
00:21:51,108 --> 00:21:55,096
Downpayment less than spending a night out
in the town in a fancy restaurant.

233
00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:00,025
It was late september when
we got out here

234
00:22:00,413 --> 00:22:03,838
and the first snow
started to fall later that afternoon.

235
00:22:09,234 --> 00:22:11,328
I was trained as an architect,
and then graduated.

236
00:22:11,939 --> 00:22:16,121
And chose to live in a dirt hole
and build a house around myself.

237
00:22:20,717 --> 00:22:22,423
Pitch my tent, it´s windy as fucking hell.

238
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:25,722
And I come home from work
and my tent be like blown over...

239
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:30,111
OK, well, fucking fix my tent. Go out into
town that evening for 7 or 8 more tyres.

240
00:22:31,195 --> 00:22:35,204
It took us about 5 or 6 years
to build the first part of it,

241
00:22:35,239 --> 00:22:36,714
and then we headed on of course.

242
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:40,162
But you know, we did it
on weekends and out of pocket.

243
00:22:40,882 --> 00:22:42,139
So in about two months...

244
00:22:42,909 --> 00:22:47,723
I had my main "U" walls up, my tent right
in the middle blocked from the wind,

245
00:22:47,923 --> 00:22:50,596
I was like: This is fucking fantastic.
You know what I mean?

246
00:22:51,071 --> 00:22:52,886
I was just like. I´ve got a windblock.

247
00:22:55,673 --> 00:22:59,141
We lived on the side
in a little tarp structure,

248
00:22:59,206 --> 00:23:02,606
at the bottom of the excavation here.

249
00:23:03,346 --> 00:23:06,333
Living in dirt, living in uninsulated space...

250
00:23:06,542 --> 00:23:08,474
my water would freeze over night.

251
00:23:08,475 --> 00:23:12,776
I mean, I didn´t have a flash toilet
until this february, 11 years later.

252
00:23:16,861 --> 00:23:19,341
I was inspired to build
my earthship by watching

253
00:23:19,662 --> 00:23:22,558
the amazing people
around me who were doing it.

254
00:23:23,113 --> 00:23:25,186
When they were pounding tyres,

255
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,960
and living out of tarp tents,
making spaghetti together on rainy nights

256
00:23:28,127 --> 00:23:30,703
and playing guitar
on upside down barrels for chairs

257
00:23:31,527 --> 00:23:32,637
and having bonfires.

258
00:23:34,389 --> 00:23:36,992
I had never experienced a bunch
of people working that hard.

259
00:23:37,878 --> 00:23:39,456
I thought: "This is not a bunch of hippies."

260
00:23:39,813 --> 00:23:44,125
I was like, yeah, this occasional hippie
that disappeales to you, but

261
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,377
I was just like,
"This has made so much sense."

262
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,941
Their story...

263
00:23:47,942 --> 00:23:52,243
of them building their earthships
with halfbaked ideas,

264
00:23:52,326 --> 00:23:54,760
that weren´t as cool as they are now.

265
00:23:55,754 --> 00:23:58,543
And doing it themselves, on no money

266
00:23:58,713 --> 00:24:03,424
and working for us, trying to make a little
money to get by on while they are doing it.

267
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:05,862
...and that subculture did it.

268
00:24:06,804 --> 00:24:09,646
And now they all are sitting
there happy as hell.

269
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:18,493
Greater World Comunity, Taos
Founded 1990

270
00:24:52,961 --> 00:24:54,347
She doesn´t know the difference between...

271
00:24:54,847 --> 00:24:59,235
this house and a conventional
home, like that I grew up in.

272
00:24:59,686 --> 00:25:02,847
But it´s just part of her,
that the house takes care of her,

273
00:25:02,849 --> 00:25:08,855
and supplies power and heats itself
and has plants that provide food,

274
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,976
and the water comes from the roof;
she knows all that,

275
00:25:12,789 --> 00:25:17,688
and she thinks that´s the way it is...
and that´s the way everyone needs to think.

276
00:25:26,368 --> 00:25:27,458
This used to be my office.

277
00:25:34,037 --> 00:25:35,451
It´s about 30 years old.

278
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,664
And these are the older gallon cresol cans.

279
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,415
So we were just using everything.

280
00:25:43,911 --> 00:25:46,757
This one was supposed to
make you fly like a crow.

281
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:52,993
So we wanted the vision
of living this way to take off.

282
00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:57,288
But we were in magic then,
for sure. For a long time.

283
00:26:12,561 --> 00:26:15,884
You know the crew always
becomes like a family.

284
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:19,570
We would work together for 4, 5, 6 years and..

285
00:26:20,736 --> 00:26:23,560
another group, they fade out
and others would come in.

286
00:26:24,581 --> 00:26:28,158
Here in the last decade though,
these people ain´t going away.

287
00:26:29,173 --> 00:26:33,511
The people that are with me now, they´ve been
here 10 years. They say this is their life.

288
00:26:34,256 --> 00:26:36,431
And this is my life and so...

289
00:26:37,783 --> 00:26:39,550
We are beyond family.

290
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:43,881
We are here, for the duration.

291
00:27:07,308 --> 00:27:08,884
You discover gold in your backyard,

292
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:11,802
you have to work to keep it a secret.

293
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:17,905
All of a sudden we are getting requests
from all over the coutry and the world...

294
00:27:18,651 --> 00:27:21,350
to do earthships,
earthship comunities and so on.

295
00:27:21,778 --> 00:27:23,887
So then I´ve got the idea myself.

296
00:27:23,888 --> 00:27:27,651
Well I do a community myself;
it´s a off grid sustainable community.

297
00:27:32,202 --> 00:27:34,970
Translate this into cities... Holy shit!

298
00:27:36,479 --> 00:27:38,837
I bought the land up at "REACH",
to do the Reach community.

299
00:27:38,992 --> 00:27:42,443
Because I wanted to really challenge
the concept on a slope of a mountain,

300
00:27:42,478 --> 00:27:45,445
where no power, water could be
gotten, or whatever.

301
00:27:46,388 --> 00:27:49,516
We learned the systems at Reach:
power, water and sewage.

302
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:54,793
And it was in fact the first New Mexicos
sustainable testing site.

303
00:27:57,404 --> 00:27:59,084
Reach was succesful.

304
00:28:00,118 --> 00:28:01,297
Now I wanted to go further.

305
00:28:02,028 --> 00:28:03,587
So I go on the other side of town

306
00:28:04,273 --> 00:28:07,147
and I get 650 acres this time.

307
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:13,019
You spend thousands of dollars,

308
00:28:13,751 --> 00:28:16,879
in the process of getting
land to have a house on.

309
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:18,982
That´s ridiculous!

310
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:21,229
Why do not just buy a chunk of land,

311
00:28:22,371 --> 00:28:23,884
not make any profit on the land,

312
00:28:23,927 --> 00:28:26,068
just have everybody own it in common,

313
00:28:27,382 --> 00:28:29,491
and all their money goes
straight to their house.

314
00:28:30,977 --> 00:28:34,457
We don´t need infrastructure. Each one
of our buildings has everything it needs,

315
00:28:34,492 --> 00:28:36,963
power, water, sewage, right in it.

316
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:42,374
We took thousands of dollars
of expenses out of the equation

317
00:28:42,518 --> 00:28:43,744
and it worked.

318
00:28:44,611 --> 00:28:46,438
Now we have a bunch of people out here

319
00:28:46,786 --> 00:28:49,243
no mortgage payment,
no utility bill

320
00:28:49,325 --> 00:28:51,698
and they are happy and we are ongoing.

321
00:28:55,153 --> 00:29:00,197
I´m not saying that I really consciously
wanted to use people as guinea pigs.

322
00:29:01,803 --> 00:29:06,867
But I was using a life situation
as a guinea pig in a sense

323
00:29:07,134 --> 00:29:09,377
because it could not worked out for you.

324
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:14,208
People piss and moan if there is a
slightest problem, and you learn from that.

325
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:18,191
If they are all complaining
about being too hot,

326
00:29:18,789 --> 00:29:22,139
or too cold, or not enough
electricity, or not enough water,

327
00:29:22,846 --> 00:29:25,488
we are gonna learn and we are gonna fix it.

328
00:29:30,651 --> 00:29:32,752
Well this is the one, where
I had the two storey greenhouse.

329
00:29:34,121 --> 00:29:36,595
It originally had a sloped front face on it,

330
00:29:37,338 --> 00:29:40,001
which just basically caught too much sun.

331
00:29:42,936 --> 00:29:44,737
And it was too hot!

332
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:53,337
Now we had ventilation and everything,
but the sun, just the direct winter sun,

333
00:29:53,504 --> 00:29:58,478
coming in at a slope, two storeys high,
was just too much.

334
00:30:03,561 --> 00:30:06,628
Some guy wanted to buy
the house, he is a rich kid,

335
00:30:07,223 --> 00:30:11,197
who came out here just to be in the
wilderness, and said "I pay anything for it"

336
00:30:11,283 --> 00:30:11,819
and I said: "OK"...

337
00:30:11,854 --> 00:30:17,182
We signed a release that it is an
experimental house, and you can buy it.

338
00:30:20,191 --> 00:30:25,746
Calls me up like a couple of months later and
says: Will you come over, I´ve got a problem.

339
00:30:31,305 --> 00:30:34,261
And he took me in his kitchen;
he is a writer...

340
00:30:35,588 --> 00:30:39,130
And he had a family typewriter

341
00:30:39,857 --> 00:30:41,630
out on the kitchen table, working,

342
00:30:42,654 --> 00:30:44,555
and the typewriter was melting!

343
00:30:46,313 --> 00:30:48,432
The plastic was just running.

344
00:30:56,033 --> 00:30:59,404
I learned that this is powerfull,
I wanted to learn to control it.

345
00:30:59,786 --> 00:31:03,403
I´m just glad, that I didn´t kill anybody,
you know, fry a baby or something...

346
00:31:16,006 --> 00:31:20,620
It takes clients to develop ideas in building.

347
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:24,692
You can´t figure out all your ideas
on your own one house,

348
00:31:25,029 --> 00:31:28,422
you need many houses to do it on, you
can´t afford to build many many houses.

349
00:31:28,602 --> 00:31:29,936
So you do need clients.

350
00:31:30,139 --> 00:31:34,057
And people have take issue with him,
because in the early days he did it badly.

351
00:31:34,418 --> 00:31:35,883
The houses leaked, they were hot...

352
00:31:35,918 --> 00:31:39,963
They looked like they have landed
from Mars or another planet.

353
00:31:42,949 --> 00:31:47,771
Most of the time you get good clients, that
realize it´s experimental what you are doing,

354
00:31:47,806 --> 00:31:49,796
and some things may not work.

355
00:31:50,563 --> 00:31:51,739
Or some things could be better.

356
00:31:52,753 --> 00:31:55,872
Then you get the occasional client who
thinks, so it´s experimental,

357
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,742
but everything must work perfectly,

358
00:31:58,415 --> 00:32:01,164
because... that´s how houses are.

359
00:32:01,942 --> 00:32:05,714
And then those people, they are disappointed.
And sometimes they sue.

360
00:32:06,934 --> 00:32:10,402
When you are doing something like running
sewage through the living room

361
00:32:10,749 --> 00:32:12,379
and building a building out of garbage,

362
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:16,810
if you really do seriously fuck up;
it´s ten times as bad.

363
00:32:17,094 --> 00:32:19,879
And, you know, if I had a roof leak,
it was law suit

364
00:32:20,485 --> 00:32:24,757
if I had a smell in the bathroom,
it was lawsuit,

365
00:32:24,758 --> 00:32:29,672
if I had a house of a 60 degrees rather
than 70, it was lawsuit.

366
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:37,485
The powers that be in the architecture
world and in the planning world...

367
00:32:37,572 --> 00:32:42,696
They just can´t see any other way
than the way they´ve got established.

368
00:32:43,413 --> 00:32:47,869
And that´s how the board
of architects basically

369
00:32:47,969 --> 00:32:54,099
cramped down his throat, that no, there is
only one way to do architectural contracts

370
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:56,938
and if you can´t do that,
then you can´t be an architect.

371
00:32:57,823 --> 00:33:02,869
The architects board asked me
to bring charges against Mike Reynolds.

372
00:33:04,207 --> 00:33:06,278
So everything that he was doing,

373
00:33:06,773 --> 00:33:10,520
fell outside the scope what New Mexico
would consider legal construction.

374
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:14,165
She said basically, they are gonna
nitpick you for the rest of your life,

375
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:15,614
because of what you are doing.

376
00:33:16,166 --> 00:33:21,848
Standardized design and construction is
so important, because it means safety.

377
00:33:22,472 --> 00:33:26,011
I was breaking the rules and laws, right
and left, there was no question about it.

378
00:33:26,132 --> 00:33:29,864
It´s not just the design,
but it was actually the building

379
00:33:30,095 --> 00:33:33,399
of these earthships that was the problem.

380
00:33:33,909 --> 00:33:35,986
That´s granted, he wasn´t playing
by the fucking rules.

381
00:33:36,589 --> 00:33:39,279
Rules are made to be broken!

382
00:33:39,611 --> 00:33:44,044
I was twisting the law to try to get
sustainable housing out there folks!

383
00:33:46,695 --> 00:33:52,369
The worst outcome that could´ve ever been for
Mike was he´d loose his licence. And he did.

384
00:33:53,192 --> 00:33:54,949
Michael Reynolds surrendered
his state architect´s license

385
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,350
to avoid prosecution

386
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,089
from malpractice during the late 1990s.

387
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:00,290
His national license was
revoked a year later.

388
00:34:09,085 --> 00:34:13,821
Every time we´ve stuck our head out of
the foxhole, we are getting the face shot off!

389
00:34:15,236 --> 00:34:18,060
And the County writes me a letter,
saying that:

390
00:34:18,095 --> 00:34:20,583
"It has come to our attention, that
you have developed three communities

391
00:34:20,618 --> 00:34:25,093
which may be in violation of one
or more of the aformentioned regulations."

392
00:34:25,334 --> 00:34:27,577
And here I was, breaking
every law in the book,

393
00:34:27,612 --> 00:34:29,821
and I said: "Fred Naverres
said I could do that".

394
00:34:29,822 --> 00:34:31,020
"oh, he´s dead"...

395
00:34:31,711 --> 00:34:32,710
"Who the fuck are you?"

396
00:34:36,498 --> 00:34:36,839
Suddenly,

397
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:40,106
there was a change of planning regime.

398
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:46,506
And within a few weeks time,
everything  started to go really badly

399
00:34:46,722 --> 00:34:49,283
for the company and for the community.

400
00:34:54,806 --> 00:34:57,612
They had a big notebook, like this thick,
even thicker than this,

401
00:34:57,647 --> 00:35:00,418
Reynolds subdivision violations.

402
00:35:03,546 --> 00:35:06,935
Subdivision law stated
that to convey property

403
00:35:06,997 --> 00:35:10,598
you have to have power, water, sewage...

404
00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:13,481
you have to have everybody owning
their specific piece of land,

405
00:35:13,684 --> 00:35:16,913
you have to prove, that you can provide
all these utilities to it.

406
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,183
You have to put in roads.

407
00:35:18,184 --> 00:35:22,442
You have to do all of these
super expensive things

408
00:35:23,302 --> 00:35:25,271
to qualify as a subdivision.

409
00:35:27,432 --> 00:35:30,801
When I was hired to be
a planning director in 1995,

410
00:35:30,802 --> 00:35:33,283
that was the first charges they gave me,

411
00:35:33,318 --> 00:35:37,560
it was to make sure, that
everybody lived by the same rules.

412
00:35:39,451 --> 00:35:43,170
They didn´t put any roadways in,
there was no service, no water.

413
00:35:43,897 --> 00:35:45,483
They didn´t put anything in.

414
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:49,845
And the state legislature at that time
just said, ok, enough is enough.

415
00:35:50,085 --> 00:35:53,023
We filed 5 subdivision
actions at the same time.

416
00:35:54,923 --> 00:35:58,042
He came out with his...

417
00:35:58,077 --> 00:36:02,279
Code enforcers, with guns on.
I mean, they shut us down.

418
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:05,551
November 1997
An injunction was issued to
stop the communities from building.

419
00:36:05,552 --> 00:36:09,674
Later, the settlements were ruled
illegally conveyed, in breach of planning law.

420
00:36:10,582 --> 00:36:11,753
So I got busted

421
00:36:11,788 --> 00:36:14,802
on building, architecture and subdivision

422
00:36:15,246 --> 00:36:16,761
all at the same time.

423
00:36:19,224 --> 00:36:23,986
I busted my ass for like
10 years to be an architect.

424
00:36:24,713 --> 00:36:26,715
And it was taken away from me.

425
00:36:26,716 --> 00:36:31,367
I mean, there is no way thats not
gonna shake you up to some extent,

426
00:36:32,001 --> 00:36:35,706
in terms of questioning your
own competence and abilities

427
00:36:37,052 --> 00:36:38,925
and are you doing the right thing?

428
00:36:49,896 --> 00:36:53,225
We fired the crew and we were
down to two or three people.

429
00:36:53,717 --> 00:36:56,212
Job sites were shut down and

430
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:59,801
people that were waiting to build,
their permits were denied.

431
00:36:59,936 --> 00:37:02,859
Even though the County
already cashed their checks.

432
00:37:06,563 --> 00:37:11,950
The spirits fell low, the people moved
out and it wasn´t a lot of work.

433
00:37:12,567 --> 00:37:16,162
You felt like the County was disapproving
of what you are doing,

434
00:37:16,197 --> 00:37:19,331
even though you were trying to
do something good for yourself.

435
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:27,006
Even logic failed at that
point to some extent,

436
00:37:27,172 --> 00:37:30,343
because there were so
many things against me

437
00:37:32,339 --> 00:37:36,040
I´m looking at it like I´ve lost
my method of livelihood,

438
00:37:36,117 --> 00:37:39,366
I´ve lost my respect,
I´ve lost my credentials.

439
00:37:39,404 --> 00:37:41,697
Basically I´ve lost everything!

440
00:37:43,408 --> 00:37:45,774
What do I do?

441
00:37:47,286 --> 00:37:48,886
When people ask you
what your heroes are

442
00:37:48,921 --> 00:37:52,120
the people that infuenced
you, impressed you,

443
00:37:52,783 --> 00:37:55,020
one of the first ones I would
say is Noah, of course.

444
00:37:55,414 --> 00:37:58,807
He build a giant wooden boat
in the middle of the desert,

445
00:37:58,983 --> 00:38:02,866
and there was no sea around and he was
building a boat, and they called him a fool,

446
00:38:02,867 --> 00:38:05,007
but he saw something coming.

447
00:38:22,837 --> 00:38:24,329
He didn´t draw for two years.

448
00:38:25,632 --> 00:38:30,215
He didn´t draw house design,
he wasn´t able to think about any details

449
00:38:31,617 --> 00:38:34,861
or how to improve upon the buildings.

450
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,960
He was just occupied by law.

451
00:38:39,157 --> 00:38:41,573
Just the atmosphere around the entire company

452
00:38:42,235 --> 00:38:43,954
was...

453
00:38:43,955 --> 00:38:45,985
everything was in question.

454
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,916
At this point I´m assesing
my life and my situation.

455
00:38:52,617 --> 00:38:56,437
Do I want to spend the next decade proving
these people wrong on a ego trip?

456
00:38:56,698 --> 00:38:59,422
Or do I wanna, however I can,

457
00:39:00,013 --> 00:39:02,286
prove sustainable housing in building!

458
00:39:05,262 --> 00:39:08,767
I went in with my tail between my legs
and I said, "What do you want me to do?"

459
00:39:08,957 --> 00:39:10,194
And they said, "Be a subdivision".

460
00:39:17,801 --> 00:39:22,594
To make the Greater world a legal subdivision,
Mike had to develop it in phases

461
00:39:22,629 --> 00:39:26,081
and then have the County come in
and inspect every phase.

462
00:39:29,793 --> 00:39:32,394
This is the application for phase
3 and 4 to be a subdivision.

463
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:35,918
We had to provide 14 copies of this.

464
00:39:38,426 --> 00:39:41,944
Archeologists had to walk the land
and look for arrowheads.

465
00:39:41,945 --> 00:39:43,669
That cost 20 000 dollars.

466
00:39:44,972 --> 00:39:48,502
And all they did was walk around
and pick up arrowheads.

467
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:59,980
Engineers had to engineer the terrain and make
diagrams and drawings that nobody ever uses.

468
00:40:00,617 --> 00:40:02,559
That was 14000 dollars.

469
00:40:05,188 --> 00:40:07,050
Just endless horseshit.

470
00:40:16,318 --> 00:40:20,141
We have a person who could not
see any bigger than the rule book.

471
00:40:20,142 --> 00:40:24,199
And I think that´s the issue that we have
before us right now on this planet.

472
00:40:24,281 --> 00:40:27,104
We´ve got lots of people who can not
see any bigger than the rule book.

473
00:40:28,354 --> 00:40:31,425
And beyond the rule book is global warming.

474
00:40:33,193 --> 00:40:36,132
The amount of expense and time, I mean...

475
00:40:36,462 --> 00:40:40,196
it was years of his life and other peoples.

476
00:40:41,219 --> 00:40:42,657
7 years later, 2004
Taos County Commision

477
00:40:42,736 --> 00:40:47,613
It took us seven years to completely
get the entire development project.

478
00:40:59,348 --> 00:41:02,359
In March 2004, Taos County Commision voted
that the community was allowed

479
00:41:02,429 --> 00:41:04,057
to continue to build within agreed rules.

480
00:41:04,098 --> 00:41:05,942
A specialist engineer had to be contracted

481
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:08,086
so Mike cold continue
to build with no licenses.

482
00:41:07,086 --> 00:41:12,990
All of a sudden I went
from a turd to a flying fish.

483
00:41:18,796 --> 00:41:24,722
They now see him as a shiny example of how
to create a subdivision in Taos County.

484
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:28,583
Jumped through all the humps and
became a legal subdivision

485
00:41:28,584 --> 00:41:31,906
selling acres of land and lots

486
00:41:32,482 --> 00:41:36,210
and building a repetitive
little generic house.

487
00:41:51,393 --> 00:41:54,954
For a little time I was not exploring,

488
00:41:55,376 --> 00:41:57,133
I was not evolving,

489
00:41:57,189 --> 00:41:59,862
I was taking what I have
learned to that date and

490
00:42:00,463 --> 00:42:02,836
keying it to convention,

491
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:07,152
as clearly, and legaly and
straightforward as I could,

492
00:42:07,373 --> 00:42:09,707
to try and not make any waves,

493
00:42:10,147 --> 00:42:15,053
just do something that they
could relate to for a few years.

494
00:42:16,655 --> 00:42:19,660
And get stable with the powers that be.

495
00:42:22,282 --> 00:42:23,930
We lost this ability

496
00:42:25,527 --> 00:42:28,274
to dream an idea and do it the next day.

497
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:33,302
We lost the right to experiment. And create
new buildings and inovations on the buildings.

498
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:35,217
You´ve gotta be able to make mistakes.

499
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:39,089
Otherwise you never evolve housing type.

500
00:42:39,812 --> 00:42:41,549
And so that´s what the rest
of the country is.

501
00:42:41,669 --> 00:42:44,691
It´s still stuck in the same
housing that they were in...

502
00:42:44,913 --> 00:42:48,523
World War II. or WWI.,
it´s the same exact housing.

503
00:42:48,969 --> 00:42:51,392
Everyone is so stressed about getting sued

504
00:42:51,427 --> 00:42:56,274
that they can not make a single mistake,
so there is no evolution of design.

505
00:42:58,793 --> 00:43:03,700
I had lost the freedom to fail.

506
00:43:16,793 --> 00:43:20,931
We are facing a future,
where we will really gonna,

507
00:43:21,487 --> 00:43:24,790
on an individual basis, gonna have
to take care of ourselves.

508
00:43:24,882 --> 00:43:28,187
New Mexico is the state where
they tested the atomic bomb.

509
00:43:28,545 --> 00:43:31,704
They designated several
thousand acres of land

510
00:43:31,739 --> 00:43:34,299
to be just absolutely
destroyed with something,

511
00:43:34,334 --> 00:43:38,709
that they didn´t even know, whether
or not it will keep on exploding or not.

512
00:43:40,979 --> 00:43:44,668
They took extreme risks, in the
interest of national security.

513
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:47,606
So what I´m saying is,

514
00:43:47,641 --> 00:43:52,054
can´t we make a few hundred
acres test sites?

515
00:43:52,715 --> 00:43:57,060
With no holes barred, to test
methods of living for the future.

516
00:43:57,692 --> 00:43:58,504
That´s a test site.

517
00:43:59,244 --> 00:44:03,013
They are allowed for bombs,
they test automobiles, airplanes.

518
00:44:03,048 --> 00:44:04,490
They should test housing!

519
00:44:12,795 --> 00:44:16,693
At this point, then I begin to realize
that we needed a change in law,

520
00:44:16,728 --> 00:44:19,252
in legislation to open the door

521
00:44:19,488 --> 00:44:22,896
for these kind of things to emerge.

522
00:44:26,007 --> 00:44:28,376
This time I wasn´t gonna fight the County,

523
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:32,377
this time I was gonna fight the State.

524
00:44:45,417 --> 00:44:47,955
Sometimes to fight the system,
you have to get into it.

525
00:44:48,455 --> 00:44:49,653
Be part of the system.

526
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:53,368
Mike in a suit... is hilarious!

527
00:44:55,203 --> 00:44:57,693
I loved it when he put on a suit.

528
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,777
I think it´s hilarious, I think it´s great.
He looks like a homeless car salesman.

529
00:45:07,045 --> 00:45:09,293
It´s fun to see him get up in there.

530
00:45:10,467 --> 00:45:13,891
It´s like a thumb in the butt
of reality right there.

531
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:22,312
I´m not a screamin´, flamin´ hippie trying
to badmouth the existing system.

532
00:45:22,905 --> 00:45:24,705
I am a part of the system.

533
00:45:25,618 --> 00:45:31,077
I had become a trojan horse, I have
infiltrated the system, I am the system now.

534
00:45:32,182 --> 00:45:35,597
OK senator. - What was that
horseshit you were saying there?

535
00:45:37,491 --> 00:45:40,120
Don´t talk to me that way.

536
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:46,090
I´ve crawled up their asshole, and I´m
gonna change them from the bloodstream.

537
00:45:58,783 --> 00:46:02,762
Mike drafts a new law to allow for
easier testing of sustainable building.

538
00:46:02,785 --> 00:46:04,885
47th Legislative Session
Santa Fe, New Mexico

539
00:46:07,116 --> 00:46:13,643
I was walking into an arena that I had
no experience and no skills for.

540
00:46:24,419 --> 00:46:25,581
It´s an extreme bill,

541
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:30,092
it´s an extreme thing
to give citicens the right to

542
00:46:30,127 --> 00:46:33,043
step outside the law for 5 to 10 years.

543
00:46:33,078 --> 00:46:38,266
But outside the law is the place
where the information lies.

544
00:46:38,437 --> 00:46:40,884
And I´m just saying, "Let us go get it."

545
00:46:45,435 --> 00:46:47,564
This building is a recipe for illness.

546
00:46:48,709 --> 00:46:51,992
Have you got a list of senators
you need to talk to this morning? - Yes.

547
00:46:53,363 --> 00:46:55,189
I´m just going down the list...

548
00:46:56,525 --> 00:47:01,143
Make sure you can get to him,
and see if you can talk to him.

549
00:47:04,534 --> 00:47:08,306
Totaly love eat the shit out of
the whole Judiciary Committee.

550
00:47:08,393 --> 00:47:12,294
Get them... try to talk to them,
get them the fliers.

551
00:47:12,708 --> 00:47:16,782
You really have to demostrate to everybody
that you are working within the system.

552
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:19,502
That you are not coming
from outside the system.

553
00:47:20,835 --> 00:47:25,399
Basically it´s gonna be called the sustainable
development testing site act.

554
00:47:28,731 --> 00:47:34,313
I have to tweak every aspect
of my being just to be there.

555
00:47:36,089 --> 00:47:37,670
You know... play a game.

556
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:43,220
It´s like some kind of a board game and the
building is round and you run around in circles

557
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,032
...talking to one person,
talking to another person.

558
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:48,491
Trying to get to this meeting,
trying to get to that meeting.

559
00:47:48,605 --> 00:47:50,936
That´s a sewage system in a living room.

560
00:47:51,773 --> 00:47:54,517
I´m not asking for money,
just permission to test.

561
00:47:54,883 --> 00:47:56,328
I understand, it´s a regulatory issue.

562
00:47:58,802 --> 00:48:03,175
Every kind of a demon or trol or
ambush you could possibly imagine

563
00:48:03,765 --> 00:48:07,698
was there waiting to
devour you and your bill.

564
00:48:08,809 --> 00:48:10,098
Senate Judiciary Committee

565
00:48:12,193 --> 00:48:16,177
All it takes is one guy coming in here,
that you didn´t talk to,

566
00:48:16,445 --> 00:48:22,098
who has a connection on this Committee.
He buggers your bill.

567
00:48:24,641 --> 00:48:28,850
One wrong word from the right person,

568
00:48:29,118 --> 00:48:31,390
and you never know how your bill died.

569
00:48:35,019 --> 00:48:37,181
We take this technology all over the world,

570
00:48:37,614 --> 00:48:42,694
and in every country the same problem exists;
how do we permit this, this is too unusual.

571
00:48:43,172 --> 00:48:45,549
We are asking for what we call test sites.

572
00:48:45,772 --> 00:48:50,042
If a person gets an idea, the next morning
they could be out there building that idea.

573
00:48:50,413 --> 00:48:51,940
It´s like a gladiator or something...

574
00:48:51,941 --> 00:48:54,937
you have to go out there and
fight of all of the people

575
00:48:54,938 --> 00:48:58,938
that are trying to ravage your bill
for whatever political reason.

576
00:48:59,362 --> 00:49:03,869
Defending the legalities of the
bill against a bank of lawyers

577
00:49:04,772 --> 00:49:07,645
who can double talk me up one
side and down the other.

578
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:10,537
How independent is the word independent?

579
00:49:10,538 --> 00:49:11,538
It´s independent of conventional ...

580
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:19,399
What they got to was picking
apart words and meanings,...

581
00:49:20,395 --> 00:49:22,025
On page 3, ...

582
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:23,709
line 10...

583
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:26,433
you used the term "real people".

584
00:49:26,434 --> 00:49:28,703
How are un-real people defined?

585
00:49:30,011 --> 00:49:34,839
There was a tremendous amount of restraint
to keep me from splattering people and papers

586
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:36,948
all over the walls of that fucking building.

587
00:49:36,959 --> 00:49:41,010
You know there were many times
when I wanted to just stand up,

588
00:49:41,222 --> 00:49:44,689
turn the desk over and say,
"This is a load of horseshit."

589
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:49,166
In the constitution we don´t call people
"real people", we call them something else.

590
00:49:49,167 --> 00:49:54,567
Randall, is there a term other
than "real people" for "real people"?

591
00:50:02,767 --> 00:50:04,304
The things you say in your definitions;

592
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:10,479
I just think your bill was drafted...
very unusually.

593
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,342
He is all over it! He doesn´t want
any of this flowery language.

594
00:50:18,921 --> 00:50:21,174
Where is delete, how do I...delete?

595
00:50:21,765 --> 00:50:26,872
Then you are gonna fyzically have to draw
a line through it. Your deletions.

596
00:50:27,969 --> 00:50:29,066
It will not let me change it.

597
00:50:31,441 --> 00:50:36,516
In a dozen different Committees,
with 7 or 8 people on each Committee

598
00:50:36,647 --> 00:50:39,508
and each one having
a little bone to pick about it,

599
00:50:39,792 --> 00:50:43,012
we had to just shred the bill
piece by piece by piece

600
00:50:43,303 --> 00:50:46,525
and deal with everybodies comments on it.

601
00:50:48,737 --> 00:50:51,016
Can not be so...

602
00:50:53,482 --> 00:50:55,788
include real people...

603
00:50:56,684 --> 00:50:58,766
Provision for research...

604
00:51:00,043 --> 00:51:03,629
They were making destructive
criticisms just to stop it,

605
00:51:03,896 --> 00:51:06,129
because they just didn´t
understand the need for it.

606
00:51:09,037 --> 00:51:15,367
The bill drafter, Gary Carlson, was the one
who had to piece that all back together.

607
00:51:16,123 --> 00:51:16,632
Me again.

608
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,521
A thousand word changes, right?
- No not thousand. Like 8!

609
00:51:20,996 --> 00:51:23,464
He just got tired of seeing it,
over and over again.

610
00:51:23,544 --> 00:51:27,092
And come back for redraft, redraft, redraft.

611
00:51:35,587 --> 00:51:37,702
House Energy and Conservation Committee

612
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:40,687
We haven´t even began
to think of the ideas.

613
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:44,786
But nodody is going to them, unless they
have a forum, in which to do it.

614
00:51:45,463 --> 00:51:48,147
What other ideas are out there

615
00:51:48,529 --> 00:51:55,743
that you are thinking would be viable,
that haven´t been tried or tested?

616
00:51:56,461 --> 00:51:59,818
They were just trying to get
their brains around this bill,

617
00:52:00,469 --> 00:52:02,656
so I had to like pull
answers out of my ass, rally!

618
00:52:03,069 --> 00:52:07,008
Building a building out of water,
out of contained water.

619
00:52:07,567 --> 00:52:09,982
There are ideas out there,
I don´t know what the fuck they are.

620
00:52:10,017 --> 00:52:14,481
But they are out there, and we want
this bill to allow us to find them.

621
00:52:15,422 --> 00:52:16,774
Everybody has got an agenda.

622
00:52:17,612 --> 00:52:21,108
And so when you talk about going through
that many committees, with that many people

623
00:52:21,825 --> 00:52:24,879
and all their different agendas and
all their different politics involved...

624
00:52:25,532 --> 00:52:27,892
This process was laughable!

625
00:52:31,229 --> 00:52:34,634
America has the safest,
cleanest housing in the world.

626
00:52:35,597 --> 00:52:40,157
My concerns will lay to life
safety and health issues.

627
00:52:41,108 --> 00:52:45,173
I´m not sure how you can exempt them
from some rules and regulations

628
00:52:45,208 --> 00:52:47,511
and then say at the same time,
they are not being violated.

629
00:52:48,208 --> 00:52:52,297
And I wouldn´t wanna send a piece of
legislation that has contradiction and ...

630
00:52:53,914 --> 00:53:02,525
It´s unclear. I find there is a lot of
inconsistent language throughout this bill.

631
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:17,353
Ridiculous amount of human energy

632
00:53:18,093 --> 00:53:18,499
mustered

633
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:20,114
and wasted

634
00:53:21,252 --> 00:53:24,359
and pissed away to get
a tinies little thing done.

635
00:53:25,999 --> 00:53:28,365
6 against 3

636
00:53:28,592 --> 00:53:30,030
The bill has been tabled!

637
00:53:34,147 --> 00:53:36,993
Tabled with 4 days left in the session,

638
00:53:37,028 --> 00:53:39,868
is a death sentence for the bill.

639
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:42,427
We were out of time.

640
00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:52,916
The dream would have been to have an inside
connection to this one committee of lawyers

641
00:53:52,951 --> 00:53:54,293
Judiciary Committee,

642
00:53:54,916 --> 00:53:57,601
we could get advice on how
to get through that committee,

643
00:53:58,488 --> 00:53:59,682
we would have a chance.

644
00:54:04,922 --> 00:54:09,211
It would make it easier for people to choose

645
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:11,431
to develop sustainable methods.

646
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:17,951
How do we know that these aren´t just
a bunch of hippies getting together

647
00:54:18,316 --> 00:54:22,583
set up a some kind of commune and
not really doing anything, but just

648
00:54:23,557 --> 00:54:25,186
talking the talk and not walking the walk.

649
00:54:26,257 --> 00:54:27,747
If this would have take off

650
00:54:28,594 --> 00:54:31,261
then the utility companies are
somewhat threatened by this,

651
00:54:32,903 --> 00:54:34,676
because there are alternatives
available to people

652
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:37,277
and they are no longer
feeding into a system

653
00:54:37,278 --> 00:54:39,718
that obviously is pretty money hungry.

654
00:54:40,254 --> 00:54:41,438
So how do you answer that?

655
00:54:41,453 --> 00:54:45,242
Actually the utility kit cat electric likes me.

656
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:48,086
Because I can get power
to people that they can´t,

657
00:54:48,087 --> 00:54:51,679
that they just don´t have time
to deal with and run the lines...

658
00:54:51,799 --> 00:54:53,152
So right now it´s not a problem.

659
00:54:53,301 --> 00:54:55,056
It takes vision, it does.

660
00:54:55,419 --> 00:54:58,072
My mom, when I was a little
girl, she gave me this card

661
00:54:58,107 --> 00:55:00,372
this tiny little cat,
that turned into a big lion, so...

662
00:55:00,373 --> 00:55:01,373
Think big!

663
00:55:01,456 --> 00:55:03,755
You think big and I appreciate that.
Thank you very much.

664
00:55:03,790 --> 00:55:05,032
I will see what I can do.

665
00:55:05,132 --> 00:55:08,092
She is the first one who really
tried to understand the bill.

666
00:55:08,488 --> 00:55:12,290
If I can persuade her to write
a good end analysis of it...

667
00:55:13,276 --> 00:55:15,376
It´s in, isn´t that true?

668
00:55:21,655 --> 00:55:22,408
So you know...

669
00:55:23,293 --> 00:55:24,911
Now this language here...

670
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:27,939
Structures and systems that inherently

671
00:55:27,984 --> 00:55:30,816
produce utilities and life support systems...

672
00:55:31,133 --> 00:55:36,305
It´s too woowo; we´ve got to redraft it so
that it sounds more credible, more legitimate

673
00:55:37,386 --> 00:55:39,267
more in line with conventional thinking.

674
00:55:40,344 --> 00:55:42,779
It´s a natural entity,...

675
00:55:44,029 --> 00:55:45,339
Initiate, lets see that...

676
00:55:52,852 --> 00:55:54,344
I think it´s 64 with c...

677
00:55:55,183 --> 00:55:57,187
Lets see how good she is!

678
00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:07,935
She knows where the power is,
she doesn´t have it, she...

679
00:56:09,281 --> 00:56:10,816
stears it and directs it.

680
00:56:17,944 --> 00:56:20,491
She went to every
representative on that committee

681
00:56:20,506 --> 00:56:23,272
no matter where they were,
on session or whatever

682
00:56:23,535 --> 00:56:26,008
and pitched the bill. I know
she worked these people,

683
00:56:26,035 --> 00:56:32,946
she worked each person on this committee
and won them over one at a time.

684
00:56:38,268 --> 00:56:41,203
This is the tale tales end right here.
If she comes out with it...

685
00:56:42,005 --> 00:56:43,236
polled, we are in.

686
00:56:44,816 --> 00:56:46,787
And if she comes out with it not polled,
we are out.

687
00:56:48,553 --> 00:56:50,205
This is basically it, right here.

688
00:57:09,163 --> 00:57:16,531
Now we got Mimi... Gale, Alpart
and Bollderros was there too.

689
00:57:16,977 --> 00:57:18,149
We´ve got 4.

690
00:57:19,251 --> 00:57:20,963
That woman is fucking amazing!

691
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:31,001
Tyre and Mill.

692
00:57:31,703 --> 00:57:33,261
It´s pretty good deal in line two.

693
00:57:33,835 --> 00:57:35,672
Got out of judiciary 9 to 2.

694
00:57:36,718 --> 00:57:38,201
It might just make it!

695
00:57:38,734 --> 00:57:41,569
There´s not any obstacle left,
there´s just time now.

696
00:57:46,857 --> 00:57:50,555
We were third on the list...
on the schedule.

697
00:57:51,271 --> 00:57:53,875
We made it to the floor,
ready for the votes.

698
00:57:54,391 --> 00:57:56,627
...I asked him a question
and there is a difference

699
00:57:56,769 --> 00:57:59,202
between yielding
the floor and asking a question.

700
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:03,792
You said you would yield to the gentleman from
McKinley and we are waiting for his response.

701
00:58:07,444 --> 00:58:09,899
Police please lock the doors!

702
00:58:10,415 --> 00:58:11,827
We asked for a roll call, Mr. speaker.

703
00:58:12,216 --> 00:58:13,317
You´ve got the roll call.

704
00:58:14,954 --> 00:58:16,582
Held hostage.

705
00:58:26,908 --> 00:58:29,980
They filibustered all the time away.

706
00:58:30,775 --> 00:58:32,453
On purpouse.

707
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:37,846
They just eat up time, blabing!

708
00:58:38,983 --> 00:58:42,980
That´s kind of a leverage thing. They were
wanting to get something from the senate.

709
00:58:43,496 --> 00:58:44,491
It´s games!

710
00:58:45,268 --> 00:58:47,931
The bill dies due to filibustering.

711
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:51,991
The legal process is ok
if you got forever.

712
00:58:52,412 --> 00:58:54,573
To be farting around with slow change.

713
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:58,297
The problem is on the planet now,

714
00:58:58,332 --> 00:59:00,250
today we need fast change.

715
00:59:04,637 --> 00:59:07,616
World famous solar radio K Taos 1019...

716
00:59:12,584 --> 00:59:16,503
K Taos national and international news
from Indonesia to India.

717
00:59:17,055 --> 00:59:19,919
A tsunami tidal wave
triggered by a massive earthquake,

718
00:59:20,314 --> 00:59:22,461
swept across the Indian ocean.

719
00:59:23,179 --> 00:59:26,089
Thousands are dead in the Indian
and Andaman islands.

720
00:59:26,492 --> 00:59:29,051
The earthquake measured
8.9 at the Richter scale.

721
00:59:30,227 --> 00:59:34,653
Seismologists say the force of
the explosion was about 23 000

722
00:59:34,688 --> 00:59:37,747
times the power of the
atomic bomb that hit Hiroshima.

723
00:59:51,841 --> 00:59:56,498
A group of architects from
the island group of Nicobar

724
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:59,277
which is right in the
center of where it happened

725
00:59:59,759 --> 01:00:02,045
asked, "Could we do anything?"

726
01:00:02,508 --> 01:00:05,592
And after a month since
the disaster hit our islands...

727
01:00:05,627 --> 01:00:09,195
it is time we do much more than
food and medicine distribution

728
01:00:09,979 --> 01:00:12,830
The need of the hour as we see
it is three major components:

729
01:00:12,865 --> 01:00:16,060
shelter, sanitation and clean water.

730
01:00:16,410 --> 01:00:21,376
April 2005
Mike and 7 crew members respond
to an urgent call for help from
the tsunami hit Andaman Islands.

731
01:00:28,373 --> 01:00:30,589
Bay of Bengal, India

732
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:45,135
You see it as you approach it from the boat,
the tree line where the wave crashed through.

733
01:00:45,717 --> 01:00:49,334
You just see everything crushed and washed
away, and devastation everywhere, and it´s...

734
01:00:50,963 --> 01:00:52,454
It was brutal.

735
01:01:24,153 --> 01:01:26,397
How could it be much worse?

736
01:01:28,038 --> 01:01:30,938
An 8.9 earthquake followed by a 30 foot wave,

737
01:01:32,888 --> 01:01:36,660
3/4 of the people are gone
and half of them are dead.

738
01:01:44,936 --> 01:01:49,834
God played a game for an hour and a half
in which everything is destroyed!

739
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:52,146
Not very long...

740
01:01:52,698 --> 01:01:57,467
Not very long. It´s a game of one
hour. It´s finished man. Nothing.

741
01:02:05,101 --> 01:02:09,584
And after disaster nothing remained, only
dead bodies, crashed roads and buildings.

742
01:02:10,869 --> 01:02:14,465
Only dead bodies of children,

743
01:02:15,888 --> 01:02:17,608
and womans, girls.

744
01:02:21,771 --> 01:02:22,728
It´s like a bomb hit.

745
01:02:29,546 --> 01:02:31,046
Concrete is shattered.

746
01:02:37,764 --> 01:02:40,262
There was 35 000 people,
and there´s 7000 left.

747
01:02:43,524 --> 01:02:49,472
We were just floored with the power
of what we saw from nature

748
01:02:49,561 --> 01:02:52,038
and how it can just in an instant

749
01:02:52,123 --> 01:02:54,251
wipe out humanity.

750
01:02:55,330 --> 01:02:58,217
You are humbled by that kind of a situation.

751
01:03:04,255 --> 01:03:05,547
This is my house.

752
01:03:10,076 --> 01:03:17,374
From this place only I am alive here.

753
01:03:19,162 --> 01:03:21,109
So you have lost a lot of friends?

754
01:03:21,110 --> 01:03:23,807
All of my friends are gone.

755
01:03:36,031 --> 01:03:39,541
We can sit together at this place for tea.

756
01:03:51,435 --> 01:03:54,104
Details of the camp.

757
01:03:54,184 --> 01:03:56,848
Number of victims:
Male 820, Female 687, total 1507

758
01:04:07,696 --> 01:04:08,650
All rooms are like this.

759
01:04:09,864 --> 01:04:16,212
Just see this room; the same room.
How can live a family in this room?

760
01:04:16,481 --> 01:04:20,168
Without bathroom, not the least space!

761
01:04:22,963 --> 01:04:25,134
This is it, nothing more!

762
01:04:26,448 --> 01:04:28,815
5, 6, 7...

763
01:04:29,528 --> 01:04:31,103
family members are living in this room.

764
01:04:32,625 --> 01:04:34,310
I also got this room,

765
01:04:34,311 --> 01:04:36,894
but I am still sleeping in the street.

766
01:04:36,929 --> 01:04:37,895
How can I sleep here?

767
01:04:42,991 --> 01:04:48,360
I don´t know who designed this,
but it´s not with people in mind.

768
01:04:48,998 --> 01:04:52,455
It´s not sensible.
It´s a joke.

769
01:04:53,676 --> 01:04:57,714
This is not a solution,
this is a mess.

770
01:05:06,669 --> 01:05:10,834
Salt water from the tsunami wave came in
and flooded out all the wells.

771
01:05:11,653 --> 01:05:13,028
So they had no water.

772
01:05:17,466 --> 01:05:18,351
This is your well?

773
01:05:19,558 --> 01:05:21,785
Two dead bodies were inside... spoiled.

774
01:05:25,683 --> 01:05:29,246
The government is driving water
to them in trucks, using gasoline.

775
01:05:29,247 --> 01:05:34,029
They are totally vulnerable,
dependent creatures now.

776
01:05:35,692 --> 01:05:40,665
They lost everything, they basically had to
start all over again from the scratch.

777
01:05:43,789 --> 01:05:47,056
When there is an absolute
breakdown of everything,

778
01:05:47,057 --> 01:05:52,070
then new ideas are clutched to,
like a lifesaver.

779
01:05:54,028 --> 01:05:56,392
You know, right now, they
want thinkers, the want planners,

780
01:05:56,458 --> 01:05:58,386
they want people to do something.

781
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:01,693
It´s like, "Do something guys, it´s crisis!"

782
01:06:08,902 --> 01:06:11,025
What we are trying to achieve is

783
01:06:12,378 --> 01:06:14,554
low tech shelter.

784
01:06:15,987 --> 01:06:18,423
But very strong for an earthquake,

785
01:06:19,287 --> 01:06:25,334
that uses local materials to make
shelter, that catches water.

786
01:06:29,987 --> 01:06:33,587
And the whole bamboo structure is
independent of the tyre structure,

787
01:06:33,622 --> 01:06:37,188
so the tyre structure could shake,
and the bamboo would slip.

788
01:06:37,602 --> 01:06:40,904
Do you think this can withstand
a 9 Richter earthquake?

789
01:06:41,643 --> 01:06:42,205
Yeah.

790
01:06:44,032 --> 01:06:45,092
It´s like this.

791
01:06:46,728 --> 01:06:47,832
See like him.

792
01:06:52,925 --> 01:06:55,698
Good job there... not bad.

793
01:07:05,008 --> 01:07:07,722
We have seen a lot of people
that have lost everything,

794
01:07:10,216 --> 01:07:11,347
And they are resilient.

795
01:07:13,861 --> 01:07:15,712
They wholeheartedly jumped on

796
01:07:15,747 --> 01:07:17,529
the fact, that this may be

797
01:07:17,564 --> 01:07:22,745
the way to keep the cool, to give
them shelter and give them water,

798
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:23,672
and treat sewage.

799
01:07:24,252 --> 01:07:25,980
There was no barriers.

800
01:07:25,981 --> 01:07:29,991
You go to a situation, it´s been
devastated, the barriers are gone.

801
01:07:30,889 --> 01:07:34,599
See Sheila, it´s mixing well.

802
01:07:36,443 --> 01:07:40,340
She is great man, she keeps Phill and I
fed with cement fast enough.

803
01:07:44,942 --> 01:07:47,976
Fully impressed man,
I take them all home with me.

804
01:07:49,434 --> 01:07:51,245
Take our Sheila home with you!

805
01:07:56,694 --> 01:07:59,171
1 rupie for a bottle.

806
01:08:03,966 --> 01:08:05,156
Kids were come out to help us.

807
01:08:05,157 --> 01:08:07,151
Locals would come out to help us.

808
01:08:07,152 --> 01:08:11,255
And they are catching on,
they are excited about what we are doing.

809
01:08:19,927 --> 01:08:21,538
Do you want a small bottle
or a big bottle? - Small.

810
01:08:34,048 --> 01:08:36,585
We got the locals making the bricks,
and they are doing pretty good.

811
01:08:46,474 --> 01:08:48,466
Baba, do you want more mixture?

812
01:08:49,832 --> 01:08:51,655
I´ll do that. You cut the bottles.

813
01:09:00,267 --> 01:09:02,255
Teach her to lay bottles like this.

814
01:09:04,690 --> 01:09:06,784
As if he´s really going to understand you.

815
01:09:10,231 --> 01:09:11,682
You lay the bottles.

816
01:09:12,952 --> 01:09:14,776
Mami will mix the cement for you.

817
01:09:16,194 --> 01:09:18,121
Mami wants to lay bottles?

818
01:09:38,757 --> 01:09:40,726
It´s called a self-sustainable house.

819
01:09:43,021 --> 01:09:45,942
Everything you need is built in.

820
01:09:47,666 --> 01:09:49,951
There´s a well underneath...

821
01:09:51,478 --> 01:09:53,138
...that collects all the rainwater.

822
01:09:53,682 --> 01:09:54,679
What is this?

823
01:09:54,714 --> 01:09:55,301
It´s ventilation...

824
01:09:56,115 --> 01:09:57,220
to draw air through...

825
01:09:57,493 --> 01:10:00,049
under the floor and
it will run over the water.

826
01:10:00,050 --> 01:10:03,196
And the water temperature will cool the air,

827
01:10:03,241 --> 01:10:06,151
so the air goes up through
the house and keeps it cool.

828
01:10:09,353 --> 01:10:12,368
Everyone said that soil wouldn´t stay on.

829
01:10:15,853 --> 01:10:19,758
But look, it´s firm. You can see.

830
01:10:24,582 --> 01:10:25,569
They have a lot of rain,

831
01:10:25,604 --> 01:10:27,510
that they don´t catch,

832
01:10:27,511 --> 01:10:32,475
so they have in that climate of that
island everything they need.

833
01:10:34,578 --> 01:10:37,735
The roof was designed to collect
the water and take it to gutters.

834
01:10:38,819 --> 01:10:40,580
Trying to get a slope at
the bottom of the gutter.

835
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:44,298
They have over a 100 inches of rainfall a year

836
01:10:44,299 --> 01:10:49,668
so there is no reason why they would
even need wells in the future.

837
01:12:35,784 --> 01:12:38,141
All right, it catches water.

838
01:12:40,949 --> 01:12:50,424
They had 10 000 liters of water stored.
No need for wells, absolutely.

839
01:12:53,269 --> 01:12:59,414
It´s like two ambrellas. Stops the sun
from heating the second roof.

840
01:13:00,155 --> 01:13:04,742
Here it doesn´t take two or three sentences
to these enginiers, to say...

841
01:13:05,796 --> 01:13:10,818
...look, we can build out
of plastic bottles, glass bottles, tyres,...

842
01:13:10,907 --> 01:13:12,569
They get very excited.

843
01:13:12,717 --> 01:13:15,691
Tell him we might make
some real easy to follow

844
01:13:16,138 --> 01:13:19,279
step by step drawings of how to do it.

845
01:13:20,754 --> 01:13:24,894
It was fantastic to see something happen

846
01:13:24,929 --> 01:13:26,797
in 14 days...

847
01:13:26,832 --> 01:13:31,283
when in three years it still couldn´t
happen in a developed country.

848
01:13:36,622 --> 01:13:38,451
As opposed to a building that is flat,

849
01:13:39,543 --> 01:13:41,918
the force of the tsunami hitting it full on,

850
01:13:42,224 --> 01:13:43,976
when it´s round, it´s spread.

851
01:13:44,095 --> 01:13:47,928
Using local materials, old tires ...

852
01:13:49,014 --> 01:13:50,740
used bottles, empty bottles ...

853
01:13:56,706 --> 01:14:00,550
We had to like beg on our hands and knees
to build these in America, and here...

854
01:14:01,645 --> 01:14:03,784
they are loving it, and want us to do it.

855
01:14:10,185 --> 01:14:14,401
Tremendous, it is magic...

856
01:14:15,959 --> 01:14:22,366
I want to make this earthship
in every of our 547 islands.

857
01:14:24,374 --> 01:14:25,943
Very beautiful.

858
01:14:26,945 --> 01:14:29,048
Very beautiful and artist.

859
01:14:30,423 --> 01:14:33,300
Please come back and visit us again.

860
01:15:02,730 --> 01:15:07,649
When you see how open people
are immediately after a disaster,

861
01:15:08,357 --> 01:15:11,716
there is a real difference
in the people and opportunity here,

862
01:15:12,823 --> 01:15:14,918
and the people and opportunity in the west.

863
01:15:17,717 --> 01:15:20,426
It´s almost like a disaster has to happen,

864
01:15:20,989 --> 01:15:23,489
to cause the rest of the
world to start preparing.

865
01:15:25,387 --> 01:15:27,493
And then it will probably be too late.

866
01:15:29,584 --> 01:15:30,539
Nature...

867
01:15:31,119 --> 01:15:34,446
can absotutely wipe out...

868
01:15:34,447 --> 01:15:35,447
people.

869
01:15:43,332 --> 01:15:46,587
Solar radio, national and international news.
America in crisis

870
01:15:46,622 --> 01:15:49,561
Hurricane Katrina has
devastated the gulf coast.

871
01:15:49,596 --> 01:15:53,866
It´s been described as the harshest
storm in american history.

872
01:15:55,162 --> 01:15:57,387
People are dying,

873
01:15:57,918 --> 01:16:00,259
they don´t have homes.

874
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:02,589
The city of New Orleans
will never be the same.

875
01:16:04,897 --> 01:16:06,983
The vast majority of New Orleans,
Luisiana is under water.

876
01:16:08,221 --> 01:16:11,584
Tens of thousands of homes
and businesses are beyond repair.

877
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:14,930
August 2005
Hurricane Katrina slams into
the Gulf Coast of America

878
01:16:15,998 --> 01:16:17,320
We are dealing with one of the worst

879
01:16:18,057 --> 01:16:20,388
natural disasters in our nations history.

880
01:16:24,376 --> 01:16:27,480
How can one punch from
the gods collapse the richest

881
01:16:27,515 --> 01:16:30,077
and most highly developed
society in the world?

882
01:16:31,130 --> 01:16:34,362
Tropical storms may be growing
in overall intensity

883
01:16:34,363 --> 01:16:37,575
due to human induced global warming.

884
01:16:43,301 --> 01:16:47,496
All of a sudden the storm is not a storm.
It´s the end of days.

885
01:16:50,924 --> 01:16:52,933
It was almost getting casual.

886
01:16:54,842 --> 01:16:56,778
And it´s no hope for that now.

887
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:59,453
There´s no way to get casual.
It´s like...

888
01:17:01,256 --> 01:17:02,463
An emergency.

889
01:17:17,535 --> 01:17:21,002
January 2006
New Mexico State Legislature
Mike re-presents his bill

890
01:17:22,979 --> 01:17:24,596
When things get confusing,

891
01:17:25,363 --> 01:17:28,986
we look to what is eternal and true
to give us sense of guidance.

892
01:17:30,258 --> 01:17:31,602
When things get chaotic,

893
01:17:32,387 --> 01:17:35,762
we look to what is lasting and unchanging
to give us a sense of poem.

894
01:17:37,710 --> 01:17:38,996
The cynical Machiaveli said:

895
01:17:39,031 --> 01:17:42,229
That wisdom consists at
being able to distinguish

896
01:17:42,451 --> 01:17:46,587
among dangers and making
a choice of the least harmful.

897
01:17:51,441 --> 01:17:55,699
Katrina wiped a major US city away.

898
01:17:58,133 --> 01:17:59,234
After Katrina...

899
01:17:59,996 --> 01:18:01,279
hundreds of thousands of people ...

900
01:18:02,284 --> 01:18:07,023
are crying at the government, because
the government is not taking care of them.

901
01:18:07,671 --> 01:18:10,432
This bill would allow individuals

902
01:18:10,453 --> 01:18:12,019
to take care of themselves

903
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:13,829
with their own methods.

904
01:18:15,301 --> 01:18:16,760
It´s like going to the people and sayin´:

905
01:18:16,795 --> 01:18:17,866
Everybody out there...

906
01:18:18,552 --> 01:18:19,691
use what´s in your mind...

907
01:18:19,726 --> 01:18:22,968
and try and come up with some better
ways for us to live

908
01:18:23,099 --> 01:18:25,793
because we don´t have
enough of them right now.

909
01:18:28,178 --> 01:18:32,274
As soon as an environmental activist
stands up and says that, it´s over with.

910
01:18:40,106 --> 01:18:42,127
I don´t think they make
the connection between...

911
01:18:42,639 --> 01:18:44,156
natural calamities...

912
01:18:44,827 --> 01:18:45,652
and global warming.

913
01:18:46,907 --> 01:18:48,271
I think that it´s a fluke.

914
01:18:50,197 --> 01:18:53,622
You are coming up with something
that people are resistant to

915
01:18:54,260 --> 01:18:56,442
because they don´t want to look
at the problem to begin with.

916
01:18:57,194 --> 01:19:00,522
If you don´t want to look at the problem, then
why would you wanna hear about a solution.

917
01:19:00,866 --> 01:19:04,137
You are doing this for their children
and their grandchildren.

918
01:19:05,078 --> 01:19:11,229
You have got to make them aware, not to scare
them. So be careful what the language you use!

919
01:19:13,251 --> 01:19:16,094
Every time you open your mouth
in the committee, it´s a liability.

920
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:18,067
You should know that by now.

921
01:19:18,511 --> 01:19:22,097
You don´t wanna scare people somewhat,
that they are paralysed by their fear.

922
01:19:22,132 --> 01:19:26,395
Because that´s what this culture is.
That´s why Bush got into office twice.

923
01:19:26,746 --> 01:19:27,895
People are terrified.

924
01:19:28,844 --> 01:19:31,357
And it´s just feeding on itself.

925
01:19:31,392 --> 01:19:35,544
You know, 9/11, terrorism. These are very
real things, I don´t mean to discount them.

926
01:19:36,774 --> 01:19:38,920
But the Earth is burning.

927
01:19:42,369 --> 01:19:44,769
I´ve been told not to mention
anything about global warming,

928
01:19:45,574 --> 01:19:47,236
oil, shortages or anything.

929
01:19:48,681 --> 01:19:52,480
Do not use global warming
as a justification for this.

930
01:19:52,481 --> 01:19:54,981
It´s jobs, economic development,
new technology...

931
01:19:55,464 --> 01:20:00,368
They are having some kind of a windfall
because of Hurricane Katrina

932
01:20:00,738 --> 01:20:03,616
is affecting the revenue
of the state of New Mexico.

933
01:20:04,923 --> 01:20:08,118
Because New Mexico is selling
a lot of oil right now.

934
01:20:08,661 --> 01:20:12,914
The Bush administration is trying
to suppress global warming science

935
01:20:13,286 --> 01:20:16,229
for the sake of protecting the profits
of the fossil fuel industry.

936
01:20:17,759 --> 01:20:19,121
You can not prove global warming.

937
01:20:20,228 --> 01:20:24,251
As a fact, a good science can not
prove global warming. It´s a myth.

938
01:20:26,129 --> 01:20:27,729
It´s not easy to face the truth,

939
01:20:27,730 --> 01:20:30,844
it´s easier to pretend
that it´s not really happening.

940
01:20:32,993 --> 01:20:38,026
House bill 697 with emergency
class, house bill 22...

941
01:20:43,633 --> 01:20:47,563
From the design side a lot of those
projects are not very pretty.

942
01:20:48,151 --> 01:20:50,485
As a matter of fact a couple
I´ve seen are downright ugly...

943
01:20:50,862 --> 01:20:54,349
This type of housing is not
unique or new to New Mexico...

944
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:56,297
I think it leaves way
too much vagueness...

945
01:20:56,910 --> 01:21:00,127
How does this mesh
with the subdivision act?

946
01:21:00,557 --> 01:21:01,842
It´s not a cash project.

947
01:21:02,396 --> 01:21:06,108
Research is expensive, research costs
money, we are not trying to make money.

948
01:21:14,994 --> 01:21:17,753
I often take years to pass bills,

949
01:21:17,788 --> 01:21:20,513
you work at it and in the next
time it´s a little bit better.

950
01:21:23,021 --> 01:21:27,101
Three years is actually a pretty short time
to get a major law through.

951
01:21:45,138 --> 01:21:50,315
Politics does slowly,
slowly grind things out.

952
01:21:51,353 --> 01:21:55,755
And that´s fine if we had hundreds
and hundreds of years on this planet.

953
01:21:56,575 --> 01:22:00,119
We have decades left on this
planet of life as we know it.

954
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:02,358
And american politics...

955
01:22:02,705 --> 01:22:05,623
is a fucking dinosaur,
that is not going to make it.

956
01:22:07,692 --> 01:22:10,243
It´s just gonna come to a grinding halt.

957
01:22:49,655 --> 01:22:51,431
This vote is about to close.

958
01:23:05,638 --> 01:23:10,715
February 2006
Mike´s second attempt
to introduce new legislation failed

959
01:23:23,238 --> 01:23:25,720
The american dream
in my opinion is in the toilet.

960
01:23:26,511 --> 01:23:27,272
It´s history.

961
01:23:28,165 --> 01:23:29,027
It´s gone.

962
01:23:30,501 --> 01:23:34,926
The american dream is now,
How do we survive the future?

963
01:23:36,339 --> 01:23:39,961
It´s not having an 8 bedroom
home with 11 bathrooms.

964
01:23:40,285 --> 01:23:43,150
It´s not having a career and a lawn.

965
01:23:43,774 --> 01:23:45,732
And all of the amenities.

966
01:23:45,733 --> 01:23:50,626
It is simply how does our children
and our childrens children

967
01:23:50,661 --> 01:23:52,221
even have a chance at life.

968
01:24:04,501 --> 01:24:07,155
One month later
In the aftermath of Hurricane Rita

969
01:24:54,013 --> 01:24:58,040
March 2006
Mike and his crew build an Earthship
for the hurricane victims

970
01:25:35,219 --> 01:25:37,683
October 2006
When the U.S. Board of Architects

971
01:25:37,712 --> 01:25:40,426
learns of Mike´s work in the
Andaman Islands...

972
01:25:40,570 --> 01:25:44,150
...they invite him to reapply for
his architect´s licence

973
01:25:51,268 --> 01:25:56,476
March 2007
Mike´s test site law was finally
approved by the State Legislature

974
01:26:07,189 --> 01:26:17,861
The carbon produced during the making
of this film has been compensated for with
rainforest restoration projects by C Level UK

975
01:26:17,862 --> 01:26:21,662
80 % of the trucks featured in this film
were powered with used cooking oil

976
01:26:21,663 --> 01:26:25,663
