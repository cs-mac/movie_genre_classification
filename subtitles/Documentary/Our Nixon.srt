have been made

that have shaped
the history of our nation.

80
00:04:26,813 --> 00:04:28,804
I remember exactly
where I was.

81
00:04:30,216 --> 00:04:33,583
My father called.
The phone rang, my father
called and he said,

82
00:04:33,653 --> 00:04:36,918
"Turn on the TV right now.
Richard Nixon's going down."

83
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:40,721
I was at home with friends,
and we were watching
television at home.

84
00:04:40,794 --> 00:04:43,592
We stayed up and,
like everyone else,
I'd been glued to

85
00:04:43,663 --> 00:04:46,154
the Select and Judiciary
Committee hearings
night after night.

86
00:04:46,232 --> 00:04:48,359
And then finally,
it had come to this.

87
00:04:48,435 --> 00:04:54,237
Therefore, I shall resign
the presidency effective
at noon tomorrow.

88
00:04:54,307 --> 00:04:57,299
But instead of
the satisfaction
I imagined I'd feel,

89
00:04:57,377 --> 00:04:59,641
I just got angrier
and angrier,

90
00:04:59,713 --> 00:05:02,477
because there was
no admission of guilt.

91
00:05:02,549 --> 00:05:03,982
There was no apology.

92
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,449
Little did I know

93
00:05:05,518 --> 00:05:07,645
that I would one day
be part of the team

94
00:05:07,721 --> 00:05:10,121

elicit that apology.

a man who, as far as I know,
had never even voted
once in his life.

one big advantage

about David Frost,

119

other than he was
a British talk show host

120
00:06:28,535 --> 00:06:30,298
with something of
a playboy reputation.

121
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:34,101
He'd had a talk show
here in the US that
had won some awards

122
00:06:34,174 --> 00:06:39,271
but hadn't syndicated well
and had been dropped
by the network.

123
00:06:39,345 --> 00:06:40,835
He ended up taking
it down to Australia,

124
00:06:40,914 --> 00:06:44,645
which is, I believe,
where he was when
the President resigned.

<i>from the power</i>
<i>of the presidency</i>

145
00:07:51,384 --> 00:07:53,614
<i>to a form of exile</i>
<i>in California.</i>

146
00:07:53,686 --> 00:07:56,484
Find out the numbers
for this, will you?
Worldwide.

147
00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:11,869
<i>BRENNAN. I remember his face.</i>

148
00:08:13,373 --> 00:08:15,705
<i>Staring out the window.</i>

149
00:08:15,775 --> 00:08:20,439
<i>Down below him,</i>
<i>a liberal America</i>
<i>cheered, gloated.</i>

150
00:08:22,148 --> 00:08:24,673
Hippies, draft dodgers,
dilettantes,

151
00:08:24,751 --> 00:08:28,118
the same people
who'd spit on me when
I got back from Vietnam.

152
00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:33,316
They'd gotten rid
of Richard Nixon,
their bogeyman.

153
00:08:46,005 --> 00:08:49,031
So what's so important
that it couldn't wait,
that it had to be today?

154
00:08:49,108 --> 00:08:53,545
I've had an idea, John,
rather a bold idea
for an interview.

155
00:08:53,613 --> 00:08:55,080
Fish and chips, please.

156
00:08:55,148 --> 00:08:56,547
And in a moment...

157
00:08:56,616 --> 00:08:57,981
Well, it's too late now.
It's done.

158
00:08:58,051 --> 00:08:59,382
I've called his people...

159
00:08:59,452 --> 00:09:00,612
You?

160
00:09:00,687 --> 00:09:03,053
Beans, peas and lamb, please.

161
00:09:03,122 --> 00:09:04,589
And made an offer.

162
00:09:04,657 --> 00:09:09,117
Now, if the subject
were to say yes,

163
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:16,525
well, he's rather
a big fish that swims
in not-untricky waters.

164
00:09:17,036 --> 00:09:20,802
So it goes without saying
that I'd want a dear friend

165
00:09:20,874 --> 00:09:23,707
and the finest producer
I know by my side.

166
00:09:28,848 --> 00:09:30,042
So who is it?

167
00:09:31,451 --> 00:09:33,248
Richard Nixon.

168
00:09:33,353 --> 00:09:35,981
(LAUGHS) Richard Nixon?

169
00:09:36,055 --> 00:09:38,455
Well, come on,
don't look like that.

170
00:09:38,524 --> 00:09:40,185
Well, how would you
expect me to look?

171
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,525
I spent yesterday
evening watching you
interview the Bee Gees.

172
00:09:43,596 --> 00:09:45,461
Weren't they terrific?

173
00:09:45,531 --> 00:09:49,524
Come on, John,
we've done political
interviews before.

174
00:09:50,803 --> 00:09:53,294
So, okay, so what
kind of interview?

175
00:09:53,373 --> 00:09:58,606
A full, extensive
look-back over his life,
his presidency.

176
00:09:58,678 --> 00:10:00,236
And?

177
00:10:00,313 --> 00:10:01,746
And what?
Come on, David.

178
00:10:01,814 --> 00:10:03,281
Surely the only thing
that would interest anyone

179
00:10:03,349 --> 00:10:05,681
about Richard Nixon
would be a confession.

180
00:10:05,752 --> 00:10:07,515
A full,
no-holds-barred
confession.

181
00:10:07,587 --> 00:10:09,817
Well, we'll get that, too.

182
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:10,878
From Richard Nixon?

183
00:10:10,957 --> 00:10:12,288
Come on, John.

184
00:10:12,358 --> 00:10:14,656
Just think of the
numbers it would get.

185
00:10:15,395 --> 00:10:17,056
Do you know how
many people watched

186
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,757
his farewell speech
in the White House?

187
00:10:18,831 --> 00:10:20,856
Four hundred million.

188
00:10:22,235 --> 00:10:24,226
But in the end,
David heard nothing.

189
00:10:24,304 --> 00:10:25,965
And soon after
arriving in California,

190
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:29,634
Nixon was rushed
to hospital with an acute
attack of phlebitis.

191
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:45,523
<i>I think it was</i>
<i>around this time</i>
<i>that Gerald Ford,</i>

192
00:10:45,591 --> 00:10:46,615
who was the new President,

193
00:10:46,693 --> 00:10:48,752
and who was desperate
to move the agenda
on from Watergate,

194
00:10:48,828 --> 00:10:51,922
gave Nixon a full,
free and absolute pardon.

195
00:10:51,998 --> 00:10:54,728
<i>Now therefore, I,</i>
<i>Gerald R. Ford,</i>

196
00:10:54,801 --> 00:10:57,463
<i>President of</i>
<i>the United States,</i>

197
00:10:57,537 --> 00:11:01,473
<i>have granted,</i>
<i>and by these presents</i>
<i>do grant,</i>

198
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:04,066
<i>a full,</i>
<i>free and absolute pardon</i>

199
00:11:04,143 --> 00:11:09,342
<i>unto Richard Nixon</i>
<i>for all offenses</i>
<i>against the United States.</i>

200
00:11:09,415 --> 00:11:11,815
It meant that the man
who had committed
the greatest felony

201
00:11:11,884 --> 00:11:14,546
in American political history
would never stand trial.

202
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,020
It was like he slipped
out the back door.

203
00:11:18,257 --> 00:11:20,020
<i>A public opinion</i>
<i>poll indicates</i>

204
00:11:20,093 --> 00:11:23,460
<i>a two-to-one disapproval</i>
<i>of the pardoning</i>
<i>of Richard Nixon.</i>

205
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:26,726
<i>CHANCELLOR. One telegram</i>
<i>from Virginia said,</i>
<i>''Roosevelt had his New Deal,</i>

206
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:30,394
<i>''Truman had his Fair Deal,</i>
<i>now Ford has</i>
<i>his crooked deal. ''</i>

207
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,461
<i>There was no deal, period.</i>

208
00:11:32,538 --> 00:11:34,904
<i>I don't think the truth</i>
<i>will ever come out.</i>

209
00:11:34,974 --> 00:11:36,635
<i>The American people</i>
<i>need to know the truth,</i>

210
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:39,940
<i>and I don't think</i>
<i>it will ever now</i>
<i>be fully known.</i>

211
00:12:03,069 --> 00:12:05,902
GANNON: So how do we
want to address
the college protests?

212
00:12:05,972 --> 00:12:07,166
Well, do we want
to lift some quotes

213
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,368
from the "stand up
and be counted" speech
in 1970?

214
00:12:10,443 --> 00:12:12,070
Sir?
GANNON: You know, maybe
we're just better off

215
00:12:12,145 --> 00:12:13,669
using the whole
Lincoln Memorial memo.

216
00:12:13,746 --> 00:12:15,213
SAWYER: Just include
the whole thing.

217
00:12:15,281 --> 00:12:17,749
Mr. President,
Swifty Lazar is here.

218
00:12:17,817 --> 00:12:20,081
Okay. No, no, stick around.

219
00:12:20,153 --> 00:12:22,348
You're gonna get
a kick out of this.

220
00:12:22,422 --> 00:12:25,653
This is my literary agent
from Hollywood.

221
00:12:25,725 --> 00:12:27,920
Hygiene obsessive.

222
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:33,390
Mr. President,
good to see you.

223
00:12:33,466 --> 00:12:35,093
Nice to see you.

224
00:12:35,168 --> 00:12:37,762
These are folks
helping me with my book.

225
00:12:37,837 --> 00:12:40,738
Diane Sawyer,
Frank Gannon,
Irving Lazar.

226
00:12:40,807 --> 00:12:42,365
Nice to meet you.
Miss Sawyer.

227
00:12:42,442 --> 00:12:44,171
Pleasure.
Mr. Gannon.

228
00:12:48,081 --> 00:12:50,106
Okay, that's it.
I'll see you after lunch.

229
00:12:50,183 --> 00:12:52,174
SWIFTY: So how
you feeling, sir?

230
00:12:52,585 --> 00:12:57,147
I'm better, thank you.
Though not yet
well enough to golf,

231
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:00,857
thank God.
I despise that game.

232
00:13:01,861 --> 00:13:04,386
Imagine, six weeks
out of office

233
00:13:04,464 --> 00:13:06,989
as President
of the United States,

234
00:13:07,066 --> 00:13:09,933
and they'd have me putting
in my hospital room.

235
00:13:10,002 --> 00:13:11,993
Never retire, Mr. Lazar.

236
00:13:12,438 --> 00:13:17,375
To me, the unhappiest
people of the world
are retired.

237
00:13:17,443 --> 00:13:19,240
No purpose.

238
00:13:19,312 --> 00:13:22,076
What makes life mean
something is purpose.

239
00:13:22,148 --> 00:13:25,049
A goal. A battle. A struggle.

240
00:13:25,118 --> 00:13:27,348
Well, even if
you don't win it.

241
00:13:27,854 --> 00:13:30,345
When my doctor
declared me unfit

242
00:13:30,423 --> 00:13:32,254
to give testimony
in the Watergate trial,

243
00:13:32,325 --> 00:13:34,555
everybody thought
I'd be relieved.

244
00:13:34,627 --> 00:13:36,219
Well, they were wrong.

245
00:13:36,295 --> 00:13:37,819
That was the lowest I got.

246
00:13:37,897 --> 00:13:42,334
Well, if it's a challenge
you want, here's one
you might enjoy.

247
00:13:42,401 --> 00:13:46,337
How to spend $2 million,
2.3 to be precise.

248
00:13:46,405 --> 00:13:48,202
It's what I got
for your memoirs.

249
00:13:48,274 --> 00:13:49,741
Well, thank you.

250
00:13:49,809 --> 00:13:51,071
Eh...

251
00:13:51,144 --> 00:13:52,907
It might be a little short
of what I wanted,

252
00:13:52,979 --> 00:13:56,540
but let me assure you,
it's a whole lot more
than they wanted.

253
00:13:56,616 --> 00:13:58,641
That book is important to me.

254
00:13:58,718 --> 00:14:02,415
It's probably the only
chance I'm gonna get
to put the record straight

255
00:14:02,488 --> 00:14:05,855
and remind people
the Nixon years
weren't all bad.

256
00:14:07,326 --> 00:14:11,228
You know, if you're trying
to put the record straight,

257
00:14:11,297 --> 00:14:12,764
I'd at least talk to him.

258
00:14:12,832 --> 00:14:13,958
NIXON: Who?

259
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,733
David Frost.
English talk show guy.

260
00:14:18,471 --> 00:14:21,372
Why would I want to
talk to David Frost?

261
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,238
Well, a while back,
he wrote asking
for an interview.

262
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,641
No.

263
00:14:25,711 --> 00:14:27,042
Well, we didn't
get back to him.

264
00:14:27,113 --> 00:14:29,445
Frankly, we didn't
find him appropriate.

265
00:14:29,515 --> 00:14:32,279
Well, I thought
that we were
doing one with CBS.

266
00:14:32,351 --> 00:14:34,319
We are. I just figured
doing it with Frost

267
00:14:34,387 --> 00:14:36,514
would be a whole lot
easier than doing it
with Mike Wallace.

268
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:40,923
It would, but it would
have a lot less,
you know, credibility.

269
00:14:40,993 --> 00:14:44,520
True, true. Could
probably get more money.

270
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,096
Really?
Look.

271
00:14:49,168 --> 00:14:52,569
We'll always have
350 on the table
from CBS.

272
00:14:52,638 --> 00:14:56,369
But if I could get
Frost to pay more
and secure better terms,

273
00:14:56,876 --> 00:14:58,969
it might be a shame to pass.

274
00:14:59,545 --> 00:15:02,742
It'd be interesting to know
where he is right now.

275
00:15:03,182 --> 00:15:05,776
We tied him to
railway tracks,
and he escaped.

276
00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:09,117
We buried him alive,
and he walked free.

277
00:15:09,188 --> 00:15:13,591
Today we're lowering
escape artist Derek Harrison
into the water

278
00:15:13,659 --> 00:15:17,993
to see if he can
miraculously
cheat death once more.

279
00:15:18,064 --> 00:15:20,498
Good evening,
and welcome to
<i>Great Escapes.</i>

280
00:15:20,566 --> 00:15:22,500
My name is David Frost.

281
00:15:24,537 --> 00:15:26,129
DIRECTOR:
Okay, that is a cut.

282
00:15:26,205 --> 00:15:27,297
Thank you.

283
00:15:27,373 --> 00:15:30,672
In any deal, you need to
know your opponent's
breaking point.

284
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:33,773
To assess that,
you might call them

285
00:15:33,846 --> 00:15:36,076
late at night
or at the weekend.

286
00:15:36,716 --> 00:15:39,549
If they take the call,
you know they're desperate.

287
00:15:39,619 --> 00:15:43,055
And from that moment on,
you know you have
the upper hand.

288
00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:45,489
(PHONE RINGING)

289
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:55,293
Hello?

290
00:15:55,368 --> 00:15:57,063
<i>Mr. Frost? Irving Lazar.</i>

291
00:15:58,437 --> 00:15:59,927
Who?

292
00:16:00,006 --> 00:16:03,169
Swifty Lazar.
I represent
President Nixon.

293
00:16:03,242 --> 00:16:04,504
What time is it?

294
00:16:04,577 --> 00:16:05,566
<i>Bad time?</i>

295
00:16:05,645 --> 00:16:08,443
(STUTTERING) No! Not at all.

296
00:16:11,517 --> 00:16:15,351
I'm calling with regard
to your request
for an interview

297
00:16:15,421 --> 00:16:18,413
and to say,
having considered it,

298
00:16:18,491 --> 00:16:22,484
my client is not
necessarily opposed
to the idea.

299
00:16:22,561 --> 00:16:26,292
Really?
Well, that's
terrific news!

300
00:16:26,365 --> 00:16:28,094
For God's sake.

301
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:30,226
<i>SWIFTY. I got $500,000.</i>

302
00:16:30,303 --> 00:16:31,702
Is that good?

303
00:16:31,771 --> 00:16:36,401
Mr. President,
it's a half a million dollars
for a news interview.

304
00:16:36,475 --> 00:16:37,737
It's unprecedented.

305
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:40,005
Yeah? Well, what's the catch?

306
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,242
<i>With Frost? None.</i>
<i>It'll be a big wet kiss.</i>

307
00:16:43,816 --> 00:16:46,444
This guy'll be so grateful
to be getting it at all,

308
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:48,214
he'll pitch
puffballs all night

309
00:16:48,287 --> 00:16:51,120
and pay a half
a million dollars
for the privilege.

310
00:16:54,493 --> 00:16:56,859
Well, you think
you could get 550?

311
00:16:58,164 --> 00:16:59,495
I got 6.

312
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,065
BIRT: David, how could
you have done that?
What?

313
00:17:03,135 --> 00:17:05,069
$600,000. That's a fortune.

314
00:17:05,137 --> 00:17:06,126
200 on signature?

315
00:17:06,205 --> 00:17:07,672
Don't worry about the money.

316
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,106
My God.
Most Americans think
he belongs in jail.

317
00:17:10,176 --> 00:17:11,871
You're making him
a rich man.

318
00:17:11,944 --> 00:17:13,878
Plus, by outbidding them,
you've already made enemies

319
00:17:13,946 --> 00:17:15,436
of the networks.
They're just jealous.

320
00:17:15,514 --> 00:17:18,039
They're already sounding off
about checkbook journalism.

321
00:17:18,117 --> 00:17:19,550
And if the networks
are against you,

322
00:17:19,618 --> 00:17:21,017
syndication's always
going to be a struggle.

323
00:17:21,087 --> 00:17:22,645
No syndication,
no advance sales.

324
00:17:22,722 --> 00:17:24,246
No advance sales,
no commercials.

325
00:17:24,323 --> 00:17:25,756
No commercials, no revenue.

326
00:17:25,825 --> 00:17:29,488
And here's the bigger
question, why do it?
You don't need it.

327
00:17:29,562 --> 00:17:30,688
Your career's
in great shape.

328
00:17:30,763 --> 00:17:32,924
This will just spread you
across three continents,

329
00:17:32,998 --> 00:17:34,590
jeopardize the other shows.

330
00:17:34,667 --> 00:17:36,066
Isn't it true that
Channel Nine in Australia

331
00:17:36,135 --> 00:17:37,830
want you to do
another season
of your talk show for them?

332
00:17:37,903 --> 00:17:38,961
Yes.
And London, too?

333
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:41,165
Yes, but that would be
London and Australia.

334
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,003
This would be...
What?

335
00:17:43,609 --> 00:17:45,099
You wouldn't
understand, John.

336
00:17:45,177 --> 00:17:48,010
You were never
part of the show
in New York,

337
00:17:48,647 --> 00:17:50,444
but it's indescribable.

338
00:17:50,516 --> 00:17:55,579
Success in America
is unlike success
anywhere else.

339
00:17:57,022 --> 00:17:59,047
And the emptiness
when it's gone.

340
00:18:00,459 --> 00:18:05,897
And the sickening
thought that it may
never come back.

341
00:18:06,832 --> 00:18:09,198
You know, there's
a restaurant in New York
called Sardi's.

342
00:18:09,268 --> 00:18:11,031
Ordinary mortals
can't get a table.

343
00:18:11,103 --> 00:18:12,798
John, the place
was my canteen!

344
00:18:12,872 --> 00:18:13,964
You know, I'd be happier

345
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:15,267
if I heard
some kind of vision

346
00:18:15,341 --> 00:18:16,501
that you had
for this interview.

347
00:18:16,575 --> 00:18:17,735
MAN: Excuse me, Mr. Frost.

348
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:18,936
I'd heard you were
going to be here.

349
00:18:19,011 --> 00:18:20,945
Would you mind?
Of course.

350
00:18:21,013 --> 00:18:22,503
But I don't.
I just hear
a man doing it

351
00:18:22,581 --> 00:18:23,843
because it would
create headlines

352
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:26,009
or give him a place
at the top table.

353
00:18:26,085 --> 00:18:27,450
And that is what
makes me nervous.

354
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,250
And you do nervous
so beautifully, John.

355
00:18:30,322 --> 00:18:33,621
"Hello, good evening
and welcome."

356
00:18:34,093 --> 00:18:35,617
(FROST LAUGHS)

357
00:18:36,829 --> 00:18:38,763
I don't actually say that.

358
00:18:38,831 --> 00:18:40,389
Hello, Mr. Frost.

359
00:18:46,972 --> 00:18:48,200
Champagne?

360
00:18:48,274 --> 00:18:49,969
CAROLINE: No, thank you.

361
00:18:50,976 --> 00:18:53,035
FLIGHT ATTENDANT:
Another glass, sir?

362
00:19:10,563 --> 00:19:12,724
You don't like champagne?

363
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,758
Not on airplanes.

364
00:19:15,835 --> 00:19:18,133
Yes, it dehydrates
one terribly.

365
00:19:18,971 --> 00:19:21,633
The trick is to have
a glass of water
on the go, too.

366
00:19:21,707 --> 00:19:24,232
Like the Viennese
serve coffee.

367
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,574
Well, I've never
been to Vienna.

368
00:19:26,645 --> 00:19:29,113
Oh. Well, you'd like it.

369
00:19:29,181 --> 00:19:32,207
It's like Paris
without the French.

370
00:19:35,221 --> 00:19:36,779
What's your name?

371
00:19:36,856 --> 00:19:38,050
Caroline.

372
00:19:38,123 --> 00:19:39,147
David.

373
00:19:39,225 --> 00:19:41,921
Yes, I know. David Frost.

374
00:19:42,928 --> 00:19:45,726
"Hello and good evening
and welcome."

375
00:19:50,469 --> 00:19:54,166
You know, I heard
an interview with you
recently on the radio.

376
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,572
You were giving it
from the back
of your Rolls-Royce.

377
00:19:56,642 --> 00:19:57,768
Bentley.

378
00:19:57,843 --> 00:19:58,901
On the phone.

379
00:19:58,978 --> 00:20:00,240
They said that
you were a person

380
00:20:00,312 --> 00:20:03,338
who defined
the age we live in.

381
00:20:03,415 --> 00:20:05,007
Really?
Mmm.

382
00:20:05,551 --> 00:20:07,143
You and Vidal Sassoon.

383
00:20:08,854 --> 00:20:11,823
But what made you
exceptional, they said,

384
00:20:11,891 --> 00:20:15,827
was that you were a person
who had achieved great fame

385
00:20:15,895 --> 00:20:19,262
without possessing
any discernible quality.

386
00:20:19,331 --> 00:20:20,559
How kind.
Mmm-hmm.

387
00:20:20,633 --> 00:20:23,932
And that you fly
around a great deal.

388
00:20:24,003 --> 00:20:26,301
Well, that's true.

389
00:20:27,206 --> 00:20:28,195
Why?

390
00:20:28,274 --> 00:20:29,764
I like to keep busy.

391
00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:31,808
Why?

392
00:20:31,877 --> 00:20:34,437
I find it
more interesting
than keeping still.

393
00:20:35,514 --> 00:20:37,448
You know,
you have very sad eyes.

394
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,947
Do I?
Mmm.

395
00:20:40,019 --> 00:20:42,010
Has anyone told
you that before?

396
00:20:42,555 --> 00:20:43,817
No.

397
00:20:43,889 --> 00:20:45,550
Are you a sad person?

398
00:20:49,428 --> 00:20:51,988
Let's talk about
you a little bit.

399
00:20:52,064 --> 00:20:54,555
Of course, you feel more
comfortable asking questions.

400
00:20:54,633 --> 00:20:56,567
How right you are!

401
00:20:56,902 --> 00:20:58,631
<i>This is your</i>
<i>captain speaking.</i>

402
00:20:58,704 --> 00:20:59,693
<i>You may have</i>
<i>noticed we've begun</i>

403
00:20:59,772 --> 00:21:01,899
<i>our final descent</i>
<i>into Los Angeles.</i>

404
00:21:02,808 --> 00:21:05,868
<i>If you could please</i>
<i>return to your seats</i>
<i>and fasten your seat belts,</i>

405
00:21:05,945 --> 00:21:08,004
<i>we'll be landing</i>
<i>very shortly. Thank you.</i>

406
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,378
CAROLINE: So how about you?
Where are you going?

407
00:21:10,449 --> 00:21:12,815
To meet Richard Nixon.

408
00:21:12,885 --> 00:21:14,113
Really?

409
00:21:15,788 --> 00:21:18,586
You know, they say he has
the most enormous head,

410
00:21:19,058 --> 00:21:20,616
but the sexiest voice.

411
00:21:20,693 --> 00:21:22,058
Where is he now?

412
00:21:22,328 --> 00:21:25,855
In some dark underground cave
licking his wounds?

413
00:21:26,732 --> 00:21:29,496
Actually, no.
In his rather smart
beachside villa

414
00:21:29,568 --> 00:21:30,626
in California.

415
00:21:30,703 --> 00:21:33,433
Really? Richard Nixon
in a beachside villa?

416
00:21:33,505 --> 00:21:35,097
How incongruous.

417
00:21:35,174 --> 00:21:37,142
You can come if you'd like.

418
00:21:37,643 --> 00:21:39,304
To meet Nixon?

419
00:21:40,045 --> 00:21:41,740
Why not?

420
00:21:43,115 --> 00:21:44,412
Are you sure?

421
00:21:47,453 --> 00:21:49,148
You know, I would love that.

422
00:21:49,221 --> 00:21:51,382
<i>PILOT. Cabin crew,</i>
<i>please prepare for arrival.</i>

423
00:21:51,457 --> 00:21:54,324
Well, I'll get
my office to call you
first thing in the morning

424
00:21:54,393 --> 00:21:56,953
and send a car with a phone.

425
00:21:57,029 --> 00:21:58,018
Oh.

426
00:22:00,466 --> 00:22:03,526
He did, too. Money no object.

427
00:22:03,602 --> 00:22:07,595
Everything glittered
and was golden.

428
00:22:07,673 --> 00:22:09,140
Well, on the outside.

429
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:12,041
<i>Of course, what I didn't know</i>
<i>was that in the meantime,</i>

430
00:22:12,111 --> 00:22:14,272
<i>he'd gone to all</i>
<i>the major networks</i>

431
00:22:14,346 --> 00:22:16,814
<i>to try and get</i>
<i>interest in the interviews.</i>

432
00:22:17,349 --> 00:22:20,216
I'm sorry, David,
but we have a policy

433
00:22:20,285 --> 00:22:22,719
of not paying
for a news interview.

434
00:22:22,788 --> 00:22:25,951
Look, we love your work
as an entertainer.

435
00:22:26,025 --> 00:22:27,151
That <i>Guinness</i> show?

436
00:22:27,226 --> 00:22:28,716
Love it. You're a funny guy.

437
00:22:28,794 --> 00:22:30,989
But an interview like this?

438
00:22:31,063 --> 00:22:33,964
You're asking us to pay
a British talk show host

439
00:22:34,033 --> 00:22:36,263
to interview
an American president

440
00:22:36,335 --> 00:22:39,998
with absolutely no
editorial controls
whatsoever in return?

441
00:22:40,072 --> 00:22:42,040
Well, you can't say
it's not a fresh approach.

442
00:22:42,107 --> 00:22:43,836
I know you're very busy.

443
00:22:43,976 --> 00:22:45,910
I'm not gonna
keep you from it.

444
00:22:46,545 --> 00:22:48,137
Thank you for coming in.

445
00:22:48,213 --> 00:22:50,306
I'm gonna have to
get back to you.

446
00:22:50,382 --> 00:22:53,249
Okay, thank you so
much for your time.

447
00:22:53,318 --> 00:22:54,376
David, good luck.

448
00:22:54,453 --> 00:22:56,819
He never let on
to anyone at the time,

449
00:22:56,889 --> 00:22:58,083
not even me.
You know,
that would have meant...

450
00:22:58,991 --> 00:22:59,980
Thanks.

451
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:03,620
<i>...admitting failure,</i>
<i>and David doesn't do failure.</i>

452
00:23:34,727 --> 00:23:36,661
FROST: There you are.

453
00:23:36,729 --> 00:23:39,220
See, you don't have
to do a thing yourself.

454
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,567
(INDISTINCT)

455
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,642
Well.

456
00:24:00,285 --> 00:24:01,445
You found it okay.

457
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,646
Yes, thank you.

458
00:24:02,721 --> 00:24:03,881
Pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Frost.

459
00:24:03,956 --> 00:24:05,048
And you, sir.

460
00:24:05,124 --> 00:24:06,648
May I present
Caroline Cushing?

461
00:24:06,725 --> 00:24:07,783
Miss Cushing.

462
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,953
Hello.
Your house is
very beautiful.

463
00:24:10,028 --> 00:24:11,188
Really. Very romantic.

464
00:24:11,263 --> 00:24:12,355
Well, thank you.

465
00:24:12,431 --> 00:24:14,262
And my producer, John Birt.

466
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:15,857
Nice to meet you.
How do you do?

467
00:24:15,934 --> 00:24:19,370
This is Mr. Lazar,
and this is Jack Brennan.

468
00:24:19,438 --> 00:24:21,770
Now, Miss Cushing,
would you like
to take a tour,

469
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,138
you know,
maybe stretch your legs
after your long journey?

470
00:24:24,209 --> 00:24:26,871
Yes, please.
I'd love that. Thank you.

471
00:24:27,913 --> 00:24:29,972
Come on in.
This is my office.

472
00:24:30,048 --> 00:24:34,178
Now, this is where Brezhnev
and I had our summit.

473
00:24:34,253 --> 00:24:38,622
Yeah. Brezhnev was there,
and Gromyko there,
Dobrynin there.

474
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:42,783
We talked for
nine hours straight.

475
00:24:43,996 --> 00:24:47,488
After the meeting,
as a souvenir of the visit,

476
00:24:47,566 --> 00:24:51,832
I remember that we had
a Lincoln specially made.

477
00:24:51,904 --> 00:24:55,101
Dark blue,
cherry wood, leather.

478
00:24:55,174 --> 00:24:57,836
Well, we got inside
for the photographers,

479
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:02,176
when the next thing you know,
he steps on the gas.

480
00:25:02,247 --> 00:25:06,980
Now, the first rule
of political life is

481
00:25:07,052 --> 00:25:11,489
you never let a president
get behind the wheel
of a car, ever.

482
00:25:11,557 --> 00:25:13,548
I mean, we're not
used to doing anything

483
00:25:13,625 --> 00:25:15,593
for ourselves,
let alone drive.

484
00:25:15,661 --> 00:25:18,858
And the Chairman, Jesus,
the way he put his foot down,

485
00:25:18,931 --> 00:25:21,695
my guess is
the last thing he drove was

486
00:25:21,767 --> 00:25:24,793
a tractor on some
Ukrainian potato farm.

487
00:25:26,705 --> 00:25:28,263
He crashed into curbs.

488
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,830
He went over speed bumps.

489
00:25:29,908 --> 00:25:32,809
He went twice
around my whole estate.

490
00:25:32,878 --> 00:25:37,679
Finally, we ended up
at some remote point
on the coast,

491
00:25:37,749 --> 00:25:40,684
out there
overlooking the sea.

492
00:25:40,752 --> 00:25:44,950
He turns off the gas,
and he talks for two hours

493
00:25:45,023 --> 00:25:48,481
about his favorite subject,
steel mills.

494
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,324
He said, "Mr. President,
most politicians

495
00:25:51,396 --> 00:25:54,092
"have tragedy
in their early lives."

496
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,198
Well, I told him that
I lost two brothers
to tuberculosis.

497
00:25:59,271 --> 00:26:04,265
And he watched his father
die from the cancer
he caught in the steelworks.

498
00:26:05,177 --> 00:26:09,546
He was a sad man
and a noble adversary.

499
00:26:10,215 --> 00:26:12,581
I wouldn't want to
be a Russian leader.

500
00:26:13,085 --> 00:26:15,451
They never know when
they're being taped.

501
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:22,890
Okay, I guess that's
it then, huh?

502
00:26:22,961 --> 00:26:24,758
Until March.
I look forward to it.

503
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,695
Well, thank you,
Mr. President. So do I.

504
00:26:26,765 --> 00:26:28,392
You know,
it's a funny thing that

505
00:26:28,467 --> 00:26:32,164
I've never been
challenged to a duel before.

506
00:26:32,237 --> 00:26:33,499
I guess that's what this is.

507
00:26:33,572 --> 00:26:35,506
FROST: Yeah, well, not really.

508
00:26:36,575 --> 00:26:38,167
Of course it is.

509
00:26:40,312 --> 00:26:41,973
And I like that.

510
00:26:43,282 --> 00:26:47,218
No holds barred, eh?
No holds barred.

511
00:26:51,089 --> 00:26:55,253
Mr. Frost, there's still
the small matter of the...

512
00:26:56,762 --> 00:26:58,024
Of course.

513
00:26:59,464 --> 00:27:01,932
I do beg your pardon.

514
00:27:12,244 --> 00:27:17,511
Right. $200,000.

515
00:27:17,883 --> 00:27:20,750
I do hope that isn't coming
out of your own pocket.

516
00:27:20,819 --> 00:27:23,913
Well, believe me,
sir, I wish my pockets
were that deep.

517
00:27:24,923 --> 00:27:26,618
Made out in the name of?

518
00:27:26,692 --> 00:27:27,818
Irving Paul Lazar.

519
00:27:27,893 --> 00:27:29,724
Richard M. Nixon.

520
00:27:38,737 --> 00:27:39,863
Here you go.

521
00:27:41,173 --> 00:27:43,038
MANOLO: Okay, smile.

522
00:27:44,409 --> 00:27:47,674
There. Now you can
put that in your
apartment in New York,

523
00:27:47,746 --> 00:27:51,307
and all your liberal friends
can use it as a dartboard.

524
00:27:51,383 --> 00:27:55,080
Well, actually,
I'm living in Monte Carlo
at the moment.

525
00:27:55,153 --> 00:27:56,552
Really?

526
00:27:56,621 --> 00:27:58,452
Yes. Goodbye, Mr. President.

527
00:27:59,992 --> 00:28:02,927
Hey. Take my advice.

528
00:28:02,995 --> 00:28:04,553
You should marry that woman.

529
00:28:04,629 --> 00:28:07,860
Yes. Lovely, isn't she?

530
00:28:07,933 --> 00:28:10,902
More important than that,
she comes from Monaco.

531
00:28:10,969 --> 00:28:12,994
They pay no taxes there.

532
00:28:14,306 --> 00:28:16,240
Bye-bye.
Goodbye.

533
00:28:24,716 --> 00:28:26,377
I bet you it did.

534
00:28:26,451 --> 00:28:27,475
What?

535
00:28:27,552 --> 00:28:28,951
Come out of his own pocket.

536
00:28:29,021 --> 00:28:31,148
You know, he couldn't
look me in the eye.

537
00:28:31,223 --> 00:28:32,850
Well, I hear
the networks
aren't biting.

538
00:28:32,924 --> 00:28:35,017
Without the networks,
the ad agencies
don't want to know.

539
00:28:35,093 --> 00:28:36,321
So if you ask me,
there's a good chance

540
00:28:36,395 --> 00:28:37,555
this whole thing
may never happen.

541
00:28:37,629 --> 00:28:42,828
Really?
So that meeting we just had
might have cost him $200,000?

542
00:28:42,901 --> 00:28:43,993
Correct.

543
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:48,328
Had I known that,
I would have offered
him a cup of tea.

544
00:28:48,807 --> 00:28:51,207
Say, did you
notice his shoes?

545
00:28:51,276 --> 00:28:52,300
No.

546
00:28:52,377 --> 00:28:55,869
Italian. No laces.
What do you think?

547
00:28:56,681 --> 00:28:59,081
My people tried to get me
to wear a pair like that.

548
00:28:59,151 --> 00:29:01,711
I think a man's shoes
should have laces, sir.

549
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,944
You do?

550
00:29:03,021 --> 00:29:06,582
Yeah. Personally,
I find those Italian
shoes very effeminate.

551
00:29:08,126 --> 00:29:09,718
Yes, quite right.

552
00:29:12,597 --> 00:29:14,724
<i>NBC EXECUTIVE. I'm sorry,</i>
<i>David, but it's a no.</i>

553
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,529
<i>Try to look at it</i>
<i>from our point of view.</i>

554
00:29:16,601 --> 00:29:19,536
<i>Why would an American network</i>
<i>hire a total outsider,</i>

555
00:29:19,604 --> 00:29:22,869
and someone who's already
had his own show canceled,
incidentally?

556
00:29:22,941 --> 00:29:24,465
I see. Well, I'm sorry
you feel this way.

557
00:29:24,543 --> 00:29:27,410
Obviously,
I think you're making
a terrible mistake.

558
00:29:30,015 --> 00:29:31,380
NBC.

559
00:29:32,818 --> 00:29:36,879
Well, that's
the networks out,
all of them.

560
00:29:38,457 --> 00:29:40,550
Well, that's the
end of that, then.

561
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:47,527
I'm sorry, David.

562
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,997
Not so fast.

563
00:29:51,403 --> 00:29:53,928
Where's your
adventurer's spirit?

564
00:29:54,005 --> 00:29:55,973
The idea is
we pay for the program

565
00:29:56,041 --> 00:30:01,069
and syndicate it
ourselves, completely
bypassing the networks.

566
00:30:01,146 --> 00:30:03,740
Just imagine it,
we'd be our own
network for the night.

567
00:30:03,815 --> 00:30:05,715
Hey, Bob.
FROST: How does that grab you?

568
00:30:05,784 --> 00:30:07,649
Hey, come on in.
David's on the phone.

569
00:30:07,719 --> 00:30:09,550
FROST: No, never been
done before.

570
00:30:09,621 --> 00:30:11,213
Historic stuff.

571
00:30:14,593 --> 00:30:17,687
Just think about it, okay?
And call me back.

572
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:19,820
Yeah?
Yeah.

573
00:30:19,898 --> 00:30:22,924
David, I'd like you
to meet Jim Reston
and Bob Zelnick,

574
00:30:23,001 --> 00:30:24,195
our two prospective
corner men.

575
00:30:24,269 --> 00:30:25,361
Delighted to meet you.

576
00:30:25,437 --> 00:30:27,234
Come on in.
Make yourselves at home.

577
00:30:27,305 --> 00:30:28,636
Bob's been
Washington correspondent

578
00:30:28,707 --> 00:30:30,004
for Public Radio
for the past 10 years.

579
00:30:30,075 --> 00:30:32,270
Moving to ABC
in the new year.

580
00:30:32,344 --> 00:30:33,675
The general feeling, David,

581
00:30:33,745 --> 00:30:37,545
is that I have been
wasting my matinee idol
looks on radio.

582
00:30:38,183 --> 00:30:40,174
Jim here teaches
at the University
of North Carolina

583
00:30:40,252 --> 00:30:44,086
and is writing a book
about the criminal
dishonesty, corruption,

584
00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:47,223
paranoia and abuses of
power of Richard Nixon.

585
00:30:47,292 --> 00:30:48,759
Second on the subject.

586
00:30:48,827 --> 00:30:49,885
Fourth.

587
00:30:49,961 --> 00:30:52,020
Well, delighted to
have you both aboard.

588
00:30:52,097 --> 00:30:54,531
Actually, before I sign on,
I would like to hear

589
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:57,466
what you were
hoping to achieve
with this interview.

590
00:30:58,069 --> 00:31:00,060
What I want to achieve?

591
00:31:00,138 --> 00:31:01,400
Yeah.

592
00:31:01,873 --> 00:31:05,570
Jim, well,
I've secured 12 taping days.

593
00:31:05,644 --> 00:31:07,578
That's close to 30 hours

594
00:31:07,646 --> 00:31:09,841
with the most compelling
and controversial politician

595
00:31:09,915 --> 00:31:11,678
of our times.

596
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,217
Isn't that enough?

597
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,451
Well, not for me.

598
00:31:17,789 --> 00:31:21,122
Look, I'd be giving up
a year of my life.
I'm leaving my family

599
00:31:21,193 --> 00:31:23,855
to work on
a subject matter
that means more

600
00:31:23,929 --> 00:31:25,624
than you can
probably imagine,

601
00:31:25,697 --> 00:31:26,789
and the idea
of doing all that

602
00:31:26,865 --> 00:31:30,301
without achieving what
I want to, personally,

603
00:31:30,368 --> 00:31:32,131
would be unthinkable to me.

604
00:31:32,204 --> 00:31:33,432
(INTERRUPTING)
FROST: No, all right.

605
00:31:34,172 --> 00:31:36,868
Well, what is it that
you want to achieve?

606
00:31:42,514 --> 00:31:45,483
I'd like to
give Richard Nixon
the trial he never had.

607
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:48,815
Of course,
we'll be asking
difficult questions.

608
00:31:48,887 --> 00:31:50,548
Difficult questions.

609
00:31:51,489 --> 00:31:53,684
The man lost 21,000 Americans

610
00:31:53,758 --> 00:31:56,192
and a million Indo-Chinese
during his administration.

611
00:31:56,261 --> 00:31:59,059
He only escaped jail
because of Ford's pardon.

612
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:02,429
Yes, but equally,
going after him
in some knee-jerk way,

613
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:06,027
you know, assuming
he's a terrible guy,

614
00:32:06,104 --> 00:32:09,801
wouldn't that only create
more sympathy for him
than anything else?

615
00:32:09,874 --> 00:32:11,341
(SIGHS) You know...

616
00:32:13,545 --> 00:32:15,342
Right now,
I submit it's impossible

617
00:32:15,413 --> 00:32:18,905
to feel anything
close to sympathy
for Richard Nixon.

618
00:32:18,984 --> 00:32:21,111
He devalued the presidency,

619
00:32:21,186 --> 00:32:24,781
and he left the country
that elected him in trauma.

620
00:32:25,924 --> 00:32:29,621
The American people
need a conviction,
pure and simple.

621
00:32:29,694 --> 00:32:32,390
The integrity of
our political system,

622
00:32:32,464 --> 00:32:38,300
of democracy as an idea,
entirely depends on it.

623
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:40,668
And if in years to come,
people look back

624
00:32:40,739 --> 00:32:42,138
and say it was
in this interview

625
00:32:42,207 --> 00:32:43,799
that Richard Nixon
exonerated himself,

626
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:46,070
that would be
the worst crime of all.

627
00:32:55,787 --> 00:32:58,847
Did you know that
Mike Wallace is doing
a piece on this?

628
00:33:00,792 --> 00:33:03,488
And that in the bars around
Capitol Hill and Georgetown

629
00:33:03,561 --> 00:33:05,324
this entire project is a joke?

630
00:33:05,397 --> 00:33:08,059
ZELNICK: Come on.
Jim, come on.

631
00:33:08,133 --> 00:33:10,465
Thanks for that, Jim.

632
00:33:11,503 --> 00:33:13,835
Could you give us
a couple of minutes?

633
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:22,569
You're unbelievable.
I'm sorry, Bob.

634
00:33:22,647 --> 00:33:24,877
You know, Jim,
I went way out
on a limb for you.

635
00:33:24,949 --> 00:33:26,541
I mean, some of us
actually want this job.

636
00:33:26,618 --> 00:33:28,108
I want it, too,
if it's done right.

637
00:33:28,186 --> 00:33:29,983
Well, how do you know
they're not
gonna do it right?

638
00:33:30,055 --> 00:33:31,283
Little Lord Fauntleroy
in there?

639
00:33:31,356 --> 00:33:32,550
Sympathy for Richard Nixon?

640
00:33:32,624 --> 00:33:34,251
What the...
He's full of shit, man!

641
00:33:34,326 --> 00:33:35,850
How do you know that?

642
00:33:38,063 --> 00:33:41,032
Is Mike Wallace
doing a piece on this?

643
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,324
Apparently.

644
00:33:43,401 --> 00:33:45,028
Why didn't you tell me?

645
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:47,169
It isn't relevant.

646
00:33:48,273 --> 00:33:52,004
What's the angle?
"British talk show host,

647
00:33:52,777 --> 00:33:56,508
"good with actresses,
not so good with
stonewalling presidents."

648
00:33:56,815 --> 00:33:58,612
That's the general idea, yeah.

649
00:33:58,683 --> 00:33:59,877
Right.

650
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:03,849
It's hard not to feel
a little insulted by that.

651
00:34:05,557 --> 00:34:08,025
Well, Bob's obviously a pro.

652
00:34:08,093 --> 00:34:09,287
What are we gonna
do about Reston?

653
00:34:09,361 --> 00:34:10,919
Well, the man's an idiot.
He's overemotional.

654
00:34:10,995 --> 00:34:12,257
Send him home.

655
00:34:13,665 --> 00:34:15,633
Well, I think
he should stay.
Why?

656
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:18,999
I liked his passion.

657
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:21,061
He will drive us
all bloody mad.

658
00:34:21,606 --> 00:34:24,336
Well, maybe, but sometimes
being out of your comfort zone

659
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:27,071
is a good thing, I'm told.

660
00:34:28,113 --> 00:34:29,375
He stays.

661
00:34:39,991 --> 00:34:44,087
<i>I took my seat</i>
<i>next to Mrs. Mao</i>
<i>at the banquet table.</i>

662
00:34:44,729 --> 00:34:49,428
<i>Now, one of the challenges</i>
<i>of life as a president</i>

663
00:34:50,135 --> 00:34:57,064
<i>is the endless round</i>
<i>of cocktail parties,</i>
<i>social engagements, banquets.</i>

664
00:34:57,809 --> 00:34:59,800
<i>And people who</i>
<i>know me would tell you</i>

665
00:34:59,878 --> 00:35:04,110
<i>that small talk is not one of</i>
<i>my strong suits, either. No.</i>

666
00:35:04,783 --> 00:35:07,877
<i>Particularly not in Mandarin.</i>

667
00:35:10,889 --> 00:35:15,883
<i>So Mrs. Mao and I,</i>
<i>we just, well, you know,</i>
<i>stared at one another.</i>

668
00:35:17,028 --> 00:35:21,328
<i>And then across the table,</i>
<i>Mrs. Nixon and</i>
<i>Chairman Mao himself, well,</i>

669
00:35:22,167 --> 00:35:24,533
<i>they stared</i>
<i>at one another, too.</i>

670
00:35:24,602 --> 00:35:27,469
<i>And then further down,</i>
<i>Dr. Kissinger</i>

671
00:35:27,539 --> 00:35:30,372
<i>and their</i>
<i>foreign minister, well,</i>

672
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:33,901
<i>you're getting</i>
<i>the picture now.</i>

673
00:35:38,583 --> 00:35:40,551
I can't stand it, Jack!

674
00:35:41,853 --> 00:35:47,018
Reducing the presidency
to a series
of banal anecdotes.

675
00:35:47,192 --> 00:35:50,025
I feel like
a circus animal
doing tricks.

676
00:35:50,228 --> 00:35:51,991
And I thought
I made it clear!

677
00:35:52,063 --> 00:35:56,591
I didn't want to take
any questions
on Watergate, damn it!

678
00:35:58,036 --> 00:36:00,402
Soon as it came
to question time,

679
00:36:00,472 --> 00:36:05,102
all those sons of bitches
ever want to hear about
is Watergate!

680
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:09,670
It's as if all
my other achievements
have ceased to exist.

681
00:36:09,747 --> 00:36:11,009
Well, sir, you're
gonna get a chance

682
00:36:11,082 --> 00:36:12,379
to talk about them
sooner than you think.

683
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:14,111
Yeah? How?

684
00:36:14,185 --> 00:36:16,585
Frost got there.
He got the money.

685
00:36:17,889 --> 00:36:19,288
What?

686
00:36:19,357 --> 00:36:20,824
I understand
most of it's borrowed,

687
00:36:20,892 --> 00:36:22,655
that his friends
have bailed him out.

688
00:36:22,727 --> 00:36:24,922
But the point is,
we start taping
at the end of March.

689
00:36:24,996 --> 00:36:27,726
Really? Now, that's terrific.

690
00:36:27,799 --> 00:36:29,562
How much time is
devoted to Watergate?

691
00:36:29,634 --> 00:36:32,501
25%. Just one of
four 90-minute shows.

692
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:34,561
What are the other
three divided into?

693
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:36,664
Domestic Affairs,
Foreign Policy,

694
00:36:36,741 --> 00:36:37,799
and Nixon the Man.

695
00:36:37,876 --> 00:36:38,865
"Nixon the Man"?

696
00:36:38,943 --> 00:36:41,104
As opposed to what?
Nixon the horse?

697
00:36:41,179 --> 00:36:44,342
Well, I imagine
it's some kind of
biographical piece.

698
00:36:45,783 --> 00:36:50,277
I can see it now.
The father that neglected me,
the brothers that died.

699
00:36:50,355 --> 00:36:52,414
Spare me.

700
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:57,553
Still, now, the fact
it's come together, now,
that's a good thing, no?

701
00:36:57,629 --> 00:37:00,860
Mr. President, it's fantastic.

702
00:37:00,932 --> 00:37:03,230
Frost is just not in
your intellectual class, sir.

703
00:37:03,301 --> 00:37:06,759
You're gonna be
able to dictate terms,
rebuild your reputation.

704
00:37:06,838 --> 00:37:11,775
If this went well,
if enough people saw it,
revised their opinion,

705
00:37:11,843 --> 00:37:15,108
you could move back East
way, way earlier
than we expected.

706
00:37:15,179 --> 00:37:17,044
You think?
I'm certain.

707
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:24,648
It would be so good
to go back to where
the action is.

708
00:37:24,722 --> 00:37:26,019
You know?

709
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:29,617
The hunger in my belly
is still there, Jack.

710
00:37:32,497 --> 00:37:35,591
I guess it all boils down
to Watergate, huh?

711
00:37:35,667 --> 00:37:38,329
Well, that's nothing
to worry about, sir.

712
00:37:38,403 --> 00:37:41,133
It's not as if
there's gonna be
any revelations.

713
00:37:41,205 --> 00:37:43,935
That stuff's been combed over
a million times.

714
00:37:44,008 --> 00:37:46,306
No one has pinned
anything on you.

715
00:37:46,377 --> 00:37:48,845
Yeah, still,
it's been a while

716
00:37:48,913 --> 00:37:50,437
since I spoke about it
on the record.

717
00:37:50,515 --> 00:37:52,278
I'm gonna start
doing my homework.

718
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:55,114
Hey, you know what would
be an interesting
thing to find out?

719
00:37:55,186 --> 00:37:56,278
What his strategy is.

720
00:37:56,354 --> 00:37:57,412
Now, where's he staying?

721
00:37:57,488 --> 00:37:59,012
I believe The Beverly Hilton.

722
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:00,614
The Beverly Hilton, you say.

723
00:38:00,692 --> 00:38:03,126
Well, I got
the numbers someplace

724
00:38:03,194 --> 00:38:05,594
of some fellows
that we could send in.

725
00:38:05,663 --> 00:38:08,257
Cubans with CIA training.

726
00:38:16,741 --> 00:38:18,675
Jesus, Jack, it was a joke.

727
00:38:20,178 --> 00:38:21,577
Yes, sir.

728
00:38:25,416 --> 00:38:27,441
<i>RESTON. A week later,</i>
<i>we said goodbye</i>
<i>to our families,</i>

729
00:38:27,518 --> 00:38:30,612
<i>we hopped on a plane,</i>
<i>and we moved into</i>
<i>The Beverly Hilton.</i>

730
00:38:30,688 --> 00:38:32,679
<i>And that's where we</i>
<i>started to dig into</i>
<i>our research</i>

731
00:38:32,757 --> 00:38:35,282
<i>and prepare</i>
<i>for the interviews.</i>

732
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,454
Yeah, as it happens, we took

733
00:38:37,528 --> 00:38:39,689
the whole question
of security very seriously.

734
00:38:42,066 --> 00:38:45,467
<i>BIRT. And from day one,</i>
<i>we kept all our files</i>
<i>in a locked safe.</i>

735
00:38:49,207 --> 00:38:52,472
Who was the guy
that Mike interviewed?
Was that Haldeman?

736
00:38:52,543 --> 00:38:54,135
BIRT: Haldeman.
RESTON: Haldeman.
And Ehrlichman, too.

737
00:38:54,212 --> 00:38:56,703
I always get
the Germans mixed up.

738
00:38:56,781 --> 00:38:59,375
I'm a little
confused by that.

739
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:02,214
What is Haldeman's
official...
Hello, darling.

740
00:39:02,854 --> 00:39:05,982
As for the work over
the months, we divided it
into three sections.

741
00:39:06,057 --> 00:39:09,618
Birt took Vietnam,
Bob took Foreign
and Domestic Policy,

742
00:39:09,694 --> 00:39:12,857
and I got Watergate
and the abuses of power.

743
00:39:12,997 --> 00:39:15,830
<i>And David,</i>
<i>we never really</i>
<i>saw much of David.</i>

744
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,390
RESTON: All right, so what
about the Huston Plan?

745
00:39:17,468 --> 00:39:19,299
You can see the seeds
of dirty tricks.

746
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:22,771
Essentially,
it's an attempt to
legalize dirty tricks.

747
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,967
That's why you gotta
get David to put it
in the question.

748
00:39:25,043 --> 00:39:26,135
Wiretapping students.

749
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:27,643
<i>NIXON ON TAPE. But they've</i>
<i>traced the money to him.</i>

750
00:39:27,712 --> 00:39:29,236
RESTON: Opening people's mail.

751
00:39:29,313 --> 00:39:30,337
What about wiretapping?

752
00:39:30,415 --> 00:39:31,404
How many people
has he wiretapped?

753
00:39:31,482 --> 00:39:33,746
This guy wiretapped
17 people.

754
00:39:33,818 --> 00:39:34,876
BIRT: Seventeen?

Including his own brother.

756
00:39:36,054 --> 00:39:37,954
But you know what?
We can't ask him
about his brother,

757
00:39:38,022 --> 00:39:40,820
'cause frankly,
if Donald Nixon
was my brother,

758
00:39:40,892 --> 00:39:42,985
I'd wiretap him, too.

759
00:39:44,228 --> 00:39:47,356
RESTON: But wait, okay,
so we have
breaking and entering.

760
00:39:47,632 --> 00:39:51,090
We have wiretapping,
conspiracy to
foster prostitution.

761
00:39:51,169 --> 00:39:52,431

We'd better have some napkins.

00:39:59,243 --> 00:40:01,108
How do we frame a question
about Cambodia,

766
00:40:01,179 --> 00:40:02,203
about the illicit
bombing of Cambodia?

767
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,269
I think you should say,

768
00:40:03,347 --> 00:40:04,974
"How far do you take
executive privilege

769

"before it becomes
an undemocratic event?"

770
00:40:06,784 --> 00:40:09,048
I think you frame
the question to him
as a Quaker.

771
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:12,817
"How do you feel as
a Quaker about annihilating
an entire people?"

772
00:40:16,327 --> 00:40:18,921
FROST: Come on.
Are they really
interested in buying time?

773
00:40:18,996 --> 00:40:20,588
Are they going to
give us the money?

774
00:40:20,665 --> 00:40:22,189
How serious are they?

775
00:40:22,266 --> 00:40:25,758
You have to set up that
he has an anti-democratic
personality.

776
00:40:25,837 --> 00:40:27,498
There's a reason they
call him Tricky Dick.

777
00:40:27,572 --> 00:40:31,099
Because I had written about
and watched Nixon for years,

778
00:40:31,175 --> 00:40:33,302
I got to play him
in our rehearsals.

BIRT: Okay,
the White House
taping system.

782
00:40:40,585 --> 00:40:43,918
Ours is not
the first administration
to use taping systems.

783
00:40:43,988 --> 00:40:45,819
Lyndon Johnson's

So did Kennedy's.

Wiretapping and alleged
abuses of power.

00:40:48,593 --> 00:40:52,461
Let me tell you,
other administrations
were up to far worse.

786
00:40:52,697 --> 00:40:55,860
And just for fun,
your close
friend Jack Kennedy.

787
00:40:56,534 --> 00:40:59,128
That man, he screwed
anything that moved,

788
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:01,898
fixed elections
and took us into Vietnam.

789
00:41:01,973 --> 00:41:04,271
And the American people,
they loved him for it!

790
00:41:04,342 --> 00:41:07,277
Whereas I,
Richard Milhous Nixon,

791
00:41:07,345 --> 00:41:11,247
worked around the clock
in their service,
and they hated me!

792
00:41:11,716 --> 00:41:15,675
Look. Look. Now I'm sweating.

793

Damn it! Damn it!

794
00:41:18,256 --> 00:41:21,350
And Kennedy's
so goddamn handsome
and blue-eyed!

795
00:41:21,425 --> 00:41:22,915
And women all over him!

796
00:41:22,994 --> 00:41:25,292
He screwed anything
that moved, and everything.

797
00:41:25,363 --> 00:41:26,625
Had a go at Checkers once.

798

David, can I talk
to you for a sec?

After researching
my last book,

812
00:42:04,435 --> 00:42:05,766
I was pretty

His darkest henchman?

00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:09,536
Colson, right.
Colson had a

(PHONE RINGING)

816
00:42:10,708 --> 00:42:11,834
sometime before June 23,

817
00:42:11,909 --> 00:42:13,342
but I never knew
the exact date,

818
00:42:13,411 --> 00:42:15,106
so I couldn't
find the transcript.

819
00:42:15,179 --> 00:42:17,374
But if you gave me
a week back in the
Federal Courthouse library...

820
00:42:17,448 --> 00:42:21,111
A week? Goodness, Jim,
we can't lose you
for that long.

821
00:42:21,185 --> 00:42:22,584
I think this is
really good stuff, Dave.

822
00:42:22,653 --> 00:42:24,621
Would there be something
I could help you with?

823

You know, if we're
gonna nail Nixon
in these interviews,

824
00:42:27,225 --> 00:42:28,624
we're gonna
have to ambush him.

825
00:42:28,693 --> 00:42:30,058
We're gonna have to
take him by surprise.

Don't worry, Jim.
We'll get him anyway.

the Plumbers Union,
the Enemies List,

you're saying all that
goes into Watergate?

846
00:43:18,175 --> 00:43:19,767
Correct.

847
00:43:19,844 --> 00:43:22,369
That is absurd
and a clear breach

848
00:43:22,446 --> 00:43:24,437
of the terms
of our agreement.

849
00:43:24,515 --> 00:43:27,575
Okay. How would
you define Watergate?

850
00:43:27,652 --> 00:43:28,880
Well, that it covers
just that.

851
00:43:28,953 --> 00:43:30,716
The Watergate
break-in of June 1 7th

852
00:43:30,788 --> 00:43:33,086
and the subsequent
cover-up and investigation.

853
00:43:33,157 --> 00:43:34,852
Fine. In which case,
the deal is off.

854
00:43:34,926 --> 00:43:38,453
Fine. In which case,
you can expect a lawsuit

855
00:43:38,562 --> 00:43:40,689
for something
in excess of $20 million

856

in damages and
loss of earnings.

857
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:45,767
The terms of the contract
clearly stipulate

858
00:43:45,836 --> 00:43:49,465
that Watergate take up
no more than 25% of the time.

859
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:52,441
Yes, but nowhere does it say
that for the rest of the 75%

860
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:55,001
he gets to drone on
and sound presidential.

talking about here.

that 60% of what he did
in office was right,

864
00:44:07,591 --> 00:44:11,459
and 30% may have been wrong,
but he thought it was right
at the time.

865
00:44:11,529 --> 00:44:13,463
Yes, but that
still leaves 10%

the wrong thing and knew it.

Did he say "performer"?

890

Yeah.
That's the word he used?

891
00:45:44,955 --> 00:45:46,149
Yeah, he said "performer."

892
00:45:46,223 --> 00:45:47,383
Not "journalist"
or "interviewer"?

893

00:53:43,767 --> 00:53:45,735
No, not that I'm aware.

1061
00:53:45,802 --> 00:53:48,236
You were obviously
born to be on the tube.

1062
00:53:50,107 --> 00:53:52,541
DAVIS: Stand by
to roll tape in 30 seconds.

1063
00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:54,702
Settling.

1064
00:54:00,117 --> 00:54:02,017
Those shoes.

1065
00:54:03,587 --> 00:54:05,487
They're Italian, aren't they?

1066
00:54:05,722 --> 00:54:07,417
My shoes? I believe so.

1067
00:54:08,125 --> 00:54:10,150
Yeah, that's interesting.

1068
00:54:11,094 --> 00:54:12,584
(SNIFFLES)

1069
00:54:14,364 --> 00:54:16,594
You don't find
them too effeminate?

1070
00:54:19,303 --> 00:54:20,770
No.

1071
00:54:20,837 --> 00:54:22,668
Well, I guess
somebody in your field

1072
00:54:22,739 --> 00:54:24,570
can get away
with them, you know.

1073
00:54:24,641 --> 00:54:26,233
Manolo, just check
my collar, will you?

1074
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:27,971
DIRECTOR: David,
starting with camera two,

1075
00:54:30,914 --> 00:54:34,441
in four, three, two.
Cue David. And...

1076
00:54:36,687 --> 00:54:41,283
Mr. President. Now,
we're going to be
covering a lot of subjects

1077
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:44,759
in a great deal of detail
over the course
of these interviews,

1078
00:54:44,828 --> 00:54:48,730
but I'd like to
begin completely
out of context

1079
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:50,426
by asking you
one question,

1080
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:53,435
more than any other,
almost every American

1081
00:54:53,503 --> 00:54:56,666
and people all over
the world want me to ask.

1082
00:54:58,775 --> 00:55:00,640
Why didn't you
burn the tapes?

1083
00:55:03,847 --> 00:55:05,678
Son of a bitch!

1084
00:55:08,485 --> 00:55:14,446
Well, Mr. Frost,
I'm surprised
by your question

1085
00:55:14,725 --> 00:55:19,628
since we have an agreement,
a contractual agreement,
I believe,

1086
00:55:19,696 --> 00:55:23,928
that we would cover Watergate
in our last taping session.

1087
00:55:33,243 --> 00:55:37,737
But if your viewers
really do have
a major concern,

1088
00:55:37,814 --> 00:55:42,842
then perhaps I should
briefly respond to it now.

1089
00:55:42,919 --> 00:55:46,047
What probably very
few people realize

1090
00:55:46,123 --> 00:55:48,353
is that the taping system
in the White House

1091
00:55:48,425 --> 00:55:51,690
was set up
by my predecessor,
President Johnson,

1092
00:55:51,762 --> 00:55:55,892
partly to avoid
the necessity of having
a secretary in every meeting,

1093
00:55:55,966 --> 00:55:58,491
and partly
to ensure there was

1094
00:55:58,568 --> 00:56:01,059
a record kept of
every verbal agreement,

1095
00:56:01,138 --> 00:56:04,107
no matter how
off the cuff or casual.

1096
00:56:04,775 --> 00:56:07,369
Now, initially, on coming
into the White House,

1097
00:56:07,444 --> 00:56:10,277
I insisted on
dismantling the system.

1098
00:56:10,347 --> 00:56:13,646
I hadn't liked
the idea at all,
but the former President,

1099
00:56:13,717 --> 00:56:15,981
President Johnson,
had repeatedly said

1100
00:56:16,053 --> 00:56:19,318
how crazy it would be
to remove the system,

1101
00:56:19,389 --> 00:56:20,981
which he felt
was the best way...

1102
00:56:21,058 --> 00:56:23,322
<i>BRENNAN. Well, in boxing,</i>
<i>you know, there's always</i>
<i>that first moment,</i>

1103
00:56:23,393 --> 00:56:25,520
and you see it in
the challenger's face.

1104
00:56:25,595 --> 00:56:27,722
It's that moment
that he feels

1105
00:56:27,798 --> 00:56:30,130
the impact from
the champ's first jab.

1106
00:56:30,467 --> 00:56:34,233
It's kind of
a sickening moment,
when he realizes that

1107
00:56:34,304 --> 00:56:37,603
all those months
of pep talks and the hype,

1108
00:56:37,674 --> 00:56:40,837
the psyching yourself up,
had been delusional all along.

1109
00:56:40,911 --> 00:56:42,879
You could see it
in Frost's face.

1110
00:56:42,946 --> 00:56:45,141
If he didn't know
the caliber of the man

1111
00:56:45,215 --> 00:56:47,342
that he was up against
before the interview started,

1112
00:56:47,417 --> 00:56:49,908
he certainly knew
it halfway through
the President's first answer.

1113
00:56:49,986 --> 00:56:52,853
NIXON: You see,
since the best advice is

1114
00:56:52,923 --> 00:56:56,518
almost always
of the confidential variety,

1115
00:56:56,593 --> 00:56:58,754
now the tapes have
been made public,

1116
00:56:58,829 --> 00:57:01,320
people are unlikely
ever to feel comfortable

1117
00:57:01,398 --> 00:57:03,958
speaking in confidence
at the White House.

1118
00:57:04,034 --> 00:57:07,868
They're less likely
to offer that advice.
So in the end,

1119
00:57:07,938 --> 00:57:10,168
it's the whole
political system and,

1120
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:13,175
by implication, it's
the country that suffers.

1121
00:57:13,243 --> 00:57:15,268
So much for
our "ballsy" opening.

1122
00:57:18,148 --> 00:57:21,242
So when did you
actually decide...

1123
00:57:21,318 --> 00:57:24,253
At what moment did you know
you were going to resign?

1124
00:57:24,321 --> 00:57:26,289
That's good. That's good.

1125
00:57:27,491 --> 00:57:31,587
I remember exactly.
It was July 23.

1126
00:57:31,661 --> 00:57:34,494
After it was clear
the Southern Democrats

1127
00:57:34,564 --> 00:57:36,054
that were still against
impeachment had

1128
00:57:36,133 --> 00:57:39,193
had the screws put on them
by the Speaker of the House.

1129
00:57:40,003 --> 00:57:46,636
That night I said to
Al Haig, "Well, that's it.
There goes the presidency."

1130
00:57:47,043 --> 00:57:48,635
And, of course,
you know, being Al,

1131
00:57:48,712 --> 00:57:50,270
he tried to
talk me out of it.

1132
00:57:50,347 --> 00:57:53,111
<i>And Vice President Ford,</i>
<i>I mean, let's not forget</i>

1133
00:57:53,183 --> 00:57:56,778
he had the most
to gain personally
from my stepping down,

1134
00:57:56,853 --> 00:57:58,684
he was still
absolutely convinced that

1135
00:57:58,755 --> 00:58:00,552
we were gonna win
the impeachment vote,

1136
00:58:00,624 --> 00:58:02,387
<i>and comfortably.</i>
John, we have to do something.

1137
00:58:02,459 --> 00:58:03,448
We have to move this along.

1138
00:58:03,527 --> 00:58:05,222
This is desperate, John.
Do something.

1139
00:58:05,295 --> 00:58:07,695
Twenty-three minutes
on one question?

1140
00:58:07,764 --> 00:58:08,822
Okay, let's take a break.

1141
00:58:08,899 --> 00:58:10,264
Let's change the tapes.
Come on, man.

1142
00:58:10,333 --> 00:58:11,527
Stop tape.

1143
00:58:13,103 --> 00:58:14,365
DIRECTOR:
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

1144
00:58:14,437 --> 00:58:16,098
We have to take a break.
Tape change.

1145
00:58:16,173 --> 00:58:18,971
Oh. Okay, how's that?
You getting what you need?

1146
00:58:19,042 --> 00:58:20,304
It's fantastic.

1147
00:58:20,377 --> 00:58:21,969
Good. Good. Thank you.

1148
00:58:23,547 --> 00:58:24,707
Excuse me. One moment, sir.

1149
00:58:24,781 --> 00:58:26,874
NIXON: Yeah, sure.
Take your time.

1150
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:29,218
What are you doing, David?
You've got to
stop him rambling.

1151
00:58:29,286 --> 00:58:31,481
It's all right.
These are just
introductory exchanges.

1152
00:58:31,555 --> 00:58:33,022
But this session
only lasts two hours.

1153
00:58:33,089 --> 00:58:35,785
Nearly half of it's gone,
and we're wasting
valuable material, okay?

1154
00:58:35,859 --> 00:58:38,123
The moment that he made
the decision to resign,

1155
00:58:38,195 --> 00:58:39,492
we should be scoring
points with that stuff.

1156
00:58:39,563 --> 00:58:40,723
Want me to switch to Vietnam?

1157
00:58:40,797 --> 00:58:42,287
No. No.
We've got to
get something

1158
00:58:42,365 --> 00:58:44,094
out of that
resignation night.
All right?

1159
00:58:44,167 --> 00:58:47,728
That was Nixon at
his lowest point,
a total wreck. On his knees?

1160
00:58:47,804 --> 00:58:50,295
Praying with Kissinger?
Come on, you can nail
him with that stuff.

1161
00:58:50,373 --> 00:58:51,738
Listen, was that okay?

1162
00:58:51,808 --> 00:58:53,105
Perfect, sir.

1163
00:58:53,176 --> 00:58:55,838
It didn't sound too
arrogant or self-serving?

1164
00:58:55,912 --> 00:58:59,404
Not at all.
You sounded controlled,
even-handed, statesmanlike.

1165
00:58:59,482 --> 00:59:00,676
Good.

1166
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:01,910
Now continue
exactly the same way.

1167
00:59:01,985 --> 00:59:03,885
Long answers.
Control the space.

1168
00:59:03,954 --> 00:59:04,943
Don't let him in.

1169
00:59:05,021 --> 00:59:06,283
Okay, got you.

1170
00:59:09,526 --> 00:59:11,551
DAVIS: Set. And roll.

1171
00:59:16,399 --> 00:59:21,462
We're coming
back on camera three
in four, three, two and...

1172
00:59:23,907 --> 00:59:27,968
Reading the account
of those extraordinary
final days,

1173
00:59:28,044 --> 00:59:30,512
it seems your most
emotional moment came

1174
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:33,913
in that
heart-to-heart you had
with Henry Kissinger.

1175
00:59:33,984 --> 00:59:37,613
Was that perhaps
the most emotional moment
of your career?

1176
00:59:38,088 --> 00:59:39,680
RESTON: Good, good.
<i>NIXON: Yes.</i>

1177
00:59:40,423 --> 00:59:45,725
I would say it was
about as emotional
a moment as I've ever had.

1178
00:59:47,898 --> 00:59:50,025
Except, well,
you know,
it's hard to say

1179
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:52,193
what is the most
emotional moment,

1180
00:59:52,269 --> 00:59:54,863
because each is different.

1181
00:59:55,305 --> 00:59:58,399
<i>I remember the day</i>
<i>Eisenhower died.</i>

1182
00:59:58,475 --> 00:59:59,772
For God's sake.

1183
00:59:59,843 --> 01:00:04,109
<i>And the day I walked</i>
<i>my eldest daughter</i>
<i>Tricia down the aisle.</i>

1184
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:06,876
And the day during
the impeachment hearings

1185
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:10,579
when Julie,
that's my youngest,
she came into my office,

1186
01:00:10,654 --> 01:00:15,148
she threw her arms around me,
she kissed me.
She cried, you know?

1187
01:00:15,225 --> 01:00:18,126
And she so seldom cries.

1188
01:00:18,328 --> 01:00:20,660
<i>She said, ''Daddy, you're</i>
<i>the finest man I know. ''</i>

1189
01:00:20,730 --> 01:00:22,721
"Daddy, you're
the finest man I know"?

1190
01:00:23,199 --> 01:00:26,691
"And whatever you do,
I will support you.

1191
01:00:27,771 --> 01:00:32,105
"You just gotta
go through the fire,
you know, a little longer."

1192
01:00:34,477 --> 01:00:36,240
This is beautiful.

1193
01:00:36,313 --> 01:00:39,476
So Kissinger and I were
in the Lincoln Sitting Room,

1194
01:00:39,549 --> 01:00:42,541
and together we began
to reminisce

1195
01:00:42,619 --> 01:00:46,453
about some of
the great decisions that
we'd participated in.

1196
01:00:46,523 --> 01:00:49,720
There was China,
the Soviet Union,

1197
01:00:49,793 --> 01:00:52,318
the peace settlement
in Vietnam.

1198
01:00:52,395 --> 01:00:56,422
<i>Now, let me</i>
<i>tell you something that</i>
<i>I never told anybody.</i>

1199
01:00:56,499 --> 01:01:00,936
Whenever I have had
a really tough
decision to make...

1200
01:01:01,271 --> 01:01:04,035
Now, we were in
the Lincoln Sitting Room
at that time.

1201
01:01:04,107 --> 01:01:07,804
I have come into this room
for the purpose of praying.

1202
01:01:08,845 --> 01:01:12,713
"Now, Henry,
I'm a Quaker.
You're a Jew.

1203
01:01:12,782 --> 01:01:14,750
"Neither of us is
particularly orthodox,

1204
01:01:14,818 --> 01:01:17,844
"but I'd like to think
that each of us
in our own way

1205
01:01:17,921 --> 01:01:20,913
"has a deep
religious sensitivity.

1206
01:01:20,991 --> 01:01:26,088
"So if you don't mind,
could we just have a moment
of silent prayer?"

1207
01:01:26,162 --> 01:01:30,394
So we knelt down.
Now, this was in front
of that table where

1208
01:01:30,467 --> 01:01:34,631
Lincoln signed
the Emancipation
Proclamation.

1209
01:01:34,704 --> 01:01:38,140
And then after a few moments,
we both got up again,
and Henry says...

1210
01:01:38,241 --> 01:01:39,799
Is there... I'm sorry.

1211
01:01:39,943 --> 01:01:41,103
Is there a problem?

1212
01:01:41,177 --> 01:01:42,201
That's time.

1213
01:01:42,779 --> 01:01:44,906
We're over two hours.

1214
01:01:44,981 --> 01:01:47,074
Really? So soon?

1215
01:01:47,784 --> 01:01:50,753
Well, Mr. President,
I gather our time is up.

1216
01:01:50,954 --> 01:01:52,751
Gee, now, that's a pity.

1217
01:01:52,822 --> 01:01:55,313
You know,
I was beginning
to enjoy that.

1218
01:01:59,295 --> 01:02:01,661
That was terrific,
both of you.

1219
01:02:01,731 --> 01:02:03,096
We're getting some
great material.

1220
01:02:03,166 --> 01:02:04,531
You know,
it's so funny, too,

1221
01:02:04,601 --> 01:02:08,037
because I was expecting
questions on Vietnam.

1222
01:02:08,104 --> 01:02:10,595
And we prepared for that,
hadn't we, Jack?

1223
01:02:10,673 --> 01:02:12,072
Yes, so did I.

1224
01:02:12,142 --> 01:02:15,270
I guess we
just got caught up,
you know, reminiscing.

1225
01:02:15,345 --> 01:02:16,369
Indeed.

1226
01:02:16,446 --> 01:02:18,710
So, day after tomorrow,
10:00, right?

1227
01:02:18,782 --> 01:02:19,874
Yes, indeed.

1228
01:02:19,949 --> 01:02:21,644
I look forward to it.
Bye-bye.

1229
01:02:29,125 --> 01:02:31,184
There's no need
to say anything.

gonna tell him?

I'm gonna tell him
he's gotta get involved.

1236
01:02:49,712 --> 01:02:51,543
He's gotta be able
to shut him up.
Shh.

1237
01:02:51,614 --> 01:02:54,640
David, we have some
fundamental problems in
our approach that I think...

1238
01:02:54,717 --> 01:02:56,116
Don't worry, Bob.
I'm on it.

1239
01:02:56,186 --> 01:02:57,210
We can use some of
the Kissinger stuff.

1240
01:02:57,287 --> 01:02:59,016
Yeah, but we need
to discuss it sooner
rather than later...

1241
01:02:59,089 --> 01:03:00,454
Look,
I'm disappointed, too.

1242
01:03:00,523 --> 01:03:03,253
But I wonder,
could we possibly spare
the post-mortem for now?

1243
01:03:03,326 --> 01:03:05,385
I don't mean to minimize it.
It's just I've got to
get back to LA

1244
01:03:05,462 --> 01:03:06,861
to meet some people
from Weed Eater.

1245
01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:08,761
Thanks, everyone!
Great work!

1246
01:03:08,832 --> 01:03:11,027
Marv, Lloyd, great day.
Bye, David.

1247
01:03:11,101 --> 01:03:13,968
I'll see you soon.
God bless!

1248

What the hell
is Weed Eater?

1249
01:03:19,709 --> 01:03:21,939
It's a horticultural
mechanism.

1250

One of our sponsors.

1251
01:03:23,113 --> 01:03:24,478
What happened to Xerox?

1252
01:03:24,547 --> 01:03:26,811
What about
General Motors
or IBM?

1253
01:03:26,883 --> 01:03:29,943
I gather that not all of
the blue-chip accounts
came through.

1254
01:03:30,019 --> 01:03:32,214
We do have Alpo.

(STUTTERING) Wait, John.
We're already taping.

1257
01:03:36,626 --> 01:03:38,321
So we're close, right?
We're very close?

1258
01:03:38,394 --> 01:03:39,827
That's probably a question
you should ask David.

1259
01:03:39,896 --> 01:03:41,761
Are we close, John?

1260
01:03:44,667 --> 01:03:46,760
I believe we're at 30%.

1261
01:03:47,537 --> 01:03:49,027
To go? Or 30% sold?

1262
01:03:49,105 --> 01:03:51,801
Again, that's probably
a question you should...

1263
01:03:52,876 --> 01:03:54,468
Sold, 30% sold.

1264
01:03:55,178 --> 01:03:56,702
Jesus...

1265
01:03:56,846 --> 01:03:58,404
I thought
we were practically
fully financed.

1266
01:03:58,481 --> 01:04:01,609
We were. But the financing
was always conditional
on advertising sales,

1267
01:04:01,684 --> 01:04:03,379
and no one predicted
that they'd fall apart
like this.

1268
01:04:03,453 --> 01:04:05,353
Well, why have
they fallen apart?
Based on what?

1269
01:04:05,421 --> 01:04:08,219
Credibility of the project.
What else are advertising
sales based on?

1270
01:04:08,291 --> 01:04:10,452
Listen,
I understand your concern.

1271
01:04:10,527 --> 01:04:13,724
But could I ask you
to go a little easier on David
over the next couple of days,

1272
01:04:13,796 --> 01:04:16,264
bearing in mind
the extraordinary pressure
that he's under?

1273
01:04:16,332 --> 01:04:19,824
'Cause at the moment,
he's effectively paying
for all this himself.

1274
01:04:19,903 --> 01:04:23,566
So he's in it
for a lot more than
just his reputation.

1275
01:04:23,907 --> 01:04:25,204
And we're not?

1276

Yes, back again, like
the proverbial bad penny.

1281

Look, I hate to do
this to a friend,

1282
01:04:54,237 --> 01:04:57,468
and I know you're already in
for more than I asked for,

1283
01:04:57,540 --> 01:05:00,976
but I need you to dig
a little deeper.

1284
01:05:02,512 --> 01:05:04,673
I'm right up against it now.

1285
01:05:08,251 --> 01:05:11,448
So, I had
a chance to review
yesterday's tapes.

1286
01:05:11,521 --> 01:05:12,749
And?

1287
01:05:12,822 --> 01:05:16,849
Honestly?
Far too soft, David.

1288
01:05:16,926 --> 01:05:19,019
Go on. Beat me, John.
Beat me with a stick.

1289
01:05:19,095 --> 01:05:22,087
Look. No, I'm serious.

1290
01:05:22,165 --> 01:05:24,565
You have got to make it
more uncomfortable for him.

1291
01:05:24,634 --> 01:05:27,364
You can start by
sitting forward.
You've gotta attack more.

1292
01:05:27,437 --> 01:05:29,029
If he starts
tailing off, bang,

1293
01:05:29,105 --> 01:05:30,504
jump in with
another question.

1294
01:05:30,573 --> 01:05:32,598
Don't trade
generalizations.

1295
01:05:32,675 --> 01:05:33,699
Be specific.

1296
01:05:33,776 --> 01:05:36,870
And above all, don't let
him give these self-serving,
23-minute homilies.

1297
01:05:36,946 --> 01:05:37,970
Right.
And keep your distance

starts running.

Mr. President,
you came to office
promising peace,

did you get into

than US involvement
in Vietnam deepened
and the war was prolonged

consequences.

betrayed the people

was not my war.

for our being there

had perhaps not been
adequately understood
by the American people.

they hadn't realized

1335

how important
a test this was
of American credibility.

1336
01:07:49,312 --> 01:07:51,337
The whole world
was watching to see

1337

if we have the character
to see it through.

1338

Now, look,
I could have bugged out.
I could have.

1339
01:07:57,353 --> 01:08:00,015
I could have blamed it
on my predecessors.

1340
01:08:00,089 --> 01:08:02,580
I could have
pulled the troops
out of Vietnam early,

1341
01:08:02,658 --> 01:08:04,990
and very possibly,
I would have won

some Scandinavian peace prize
into the bargain.

in the cause.

And sometimes, you know,
what you believe in,
it's the harder path.

You might even say that
I was the last casualty

An invasion which everybody
advised you against.

So why did you do it?

1351
01:08:32,188 --> 01:08:33,246
Well, first of all,

1352
01:08:33,322 --> 01:08:39,750
as a result of
our incursion into Cambodia,
we picked up 22,000 rifles,

1353
01:08:39,829 --> 01:08:44,323
15 million rounds
of ammunition,
150,000 rockets, mortars.

existence of

the "headquarters of
the entire Communist military
operation in South Vietnam,"

BIRT: First time he's late.

1653
01:29:54,302 --> 01:29:56,167
REPORTER: Mr. President!

1654
01:29:56,237 --> 01:29:57,761
(CROWD CLAMORING)

1655
01:30:12,921 --> 01:30:14,115
Morning.

1656
01:30:29,304 --> 01:30:30,771
(DOOR OPENS)

1657
01:30:31,873 --> 01:30:33,704
(INDISTINCT)

1658
01:30:52,694 --> 01:30:54,025
Mr. President.

1659
01:30:54,562 --> 01:30:55,927
Mr. Frost.

1660
01:31:10,779 --> 01:31:13,009
DAVIS: Thirty seconds
to tape roll!

1661
01:31:15,583 --> 01:31:19,986
Thirty seconds.
Settling. Settle.

1662
01:31:29,631 --> 01:31:35,661
Well, if today's session is
anything like our phone call,
it should be explosive.

1663
01:31:36,871 --> 01:31:38,839
What phone call?

1664
01:31:39,340 --> 01:31:41,331
The phone call
to my hotel room.

1665
01:31:44,512 --> 01:31:48,812
DAVIS: David,
starting on camera three
in four, three, two and...

1666
01:31:56,558 --> 01:31:59,823
Now, looking back
on your final year
in office,

1667
01:32:00,061 --> 01:32:02,291
do you feel you ever
obstructed justice

1668
01:32:02,363 --> 01:32:05,696
or were part of
a conspiracy to cover up
or obstruct justice?

1669
01:32:05,767 --> 01:32:06,859
No.

1670
01:32:07,836 --> 01:32:12,671
And I'm interested
that you used the term
"obstruction of justice."

1671
01:32:12,740 --> 01:32:14,833
Now, you perhaps have not
read the statute

1672
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:17,069
with regard to
the obstruction
of justice.

1673
01:32:17,178 --> 01:32:19,703
As it happens, I have.

1674
01:32:19,781 --> 01:32:26,414
You have, you say?
Well, then, you'll know it
doesn't just require an act.

1675
01:32:26,487 --> 01:32:30,082
It requires a specific
corrupt motive.

1676
01:32:30,158 --> 01:32:33,491
And in this case,
I didn't have
a corrupt motive.

1677
01:32:33,561 --> 01:32:37,088
What I was doing
was in the interests
of political containment.

1678
01:32:37,165 --> 01:32:39,360
Be that as it may,
the direct consequences

1679
01:32:39,434 --> 01:32:41,026
of your actions
would have been

1680
01:32:41,102 --> 01:32:42,763
that two of
the convicted burglars

1681
01:32:42,837 --> 01:32:44,737
would have escaped
criminal prosecution.

1682
01:32:44,806 --> 01:32:48,139
Now, how can that
not be a cover-up or
obstruction of justice?

1683
01:32:48,209 --> 01:32:49,972
Well, I think
the record shows,
Mr. Frost,

1684
01:32:50,044 --> 01:32:53,241
that far from
obstructing justice,

1685
01:32:53,314 --> 01:32:55,839
I was actively
facilitating it.

1686
01:32:55,917 --> 01:33:00,320
When Pat Gray of the FBI
telephoned me,
this was July 6,

1687
01:33:00,388 --> 01:33:03,824
I said,
"Pat, you go right ahead
with your investigation."

1688
01:33:03,892 --> 01:33:06,122
That's hardly
what you'd call
obstructing justice.

1689
01:33:06,194 --> 01:33:09,322
Well, that may be,
but for two weeks
prior to July 6,

1690
01:33:09,397 --> 01:33:10,887
we now know that
you were desperately

1691
01:33:10,965 --> 01:33:12,398
trying to contain or block
the investigation.

1692
01:33:12,467 --> 01:33:14,162
No, no. Hang on
a minute there.
I wasn't...

1693
01:33:14,235 --> 01:33:16,032
No, no.
Obstruction of justice
is obstruction of justice,

1694
01:33:16,104 --> 01:33:18,004
whether it's for
a minute or five minutes,

1695
01:33:18,072 --> 01:33:20,097
and it's no defense
to say that your plan failed.

1696
01:33:20,174 --> 01:33:22,938
I mean, if I try to
rob a bank and fail,
that's no defense.

1697
01:33:23,011 --> 01:33:24,478
I still tried
to rob the bank.

1698
01:33:24,545 --> 01:33:27,207
Will you just wait
one minute there,
Mr. Frost?

1699
01:33:27,282 --> 01:33:29,716
There is no evidence
of any kind that I was...

1700
01:33:29,784 --> 01:33:31,217
Well, the reason
there is no evidence

1701
01:33:31,286 --> 01:33:32,947
is because
18 and a half minutes

1702
01:33:33,021 --> 01:33:36,252
of the conversation
with Bob Haldeman
from this June period

1703
01:33:36,324 --> 01:33:37,985
have mysteriously
been erased.

1704
01:33:38,059 --> 01:33:40,960
That was
an unfortunate
oversight.

1705
01:33:41,029 --> 01:33:42,519
And Bob Haldeman
is a rigorous

1706
01:33:42,597 --> 01:33:45,088
and a conscientious
note taker.

1707
01:33:45,166 --> 01:33:47,031
His notes are there
for all to see.

1708
01:33:47,101 --> 01:33:49,831
Well, we found
something rather better
than his notes,

1709
01:33:49,904 --> 01:33:53,465
a conversation
with Charles Colson,

1710
01:33:54,409 --> 01:33:57,344
which I don't think
has ever been published.

1711
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:00,911
Okay, here we go.

1712
01:34:00,982 --> 01:34:02,916
It hasn't been
published, you say?

1713
01:34:02,984 --> 01:34:06,078
No, but one
of my researchers
found it in Washington

1714
01:34:06,721 --> 01:34:09,815
where it's available
to anyone who consults
the records.

1715
01:34:09,891 --> 01:34:14,555
Well, I just wondered,
you know, if we'd seen it.

1716
01:34:14,629 --> 01:34:16,096
More than seen it,
Mr. President.

1717
01:34:16,164 --> 01:34:17,825
You spoke the actual words.

1718
01:34:17,899 --> 01:34:22,165
Now, you've always claimed
you first learned of
the break-in on June 23.

1719
01:34:22,236 --> 01:34:23,294
Yeah.

1720
01:34:23,371 --> 01:34:27,000
But this transcript of a tape
made three days earlier

1721
01:34:27,075 --> 01:34:29,543
clearly shows that
to be a falsehood.

1722
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:35,639
Now, in it you say
to Colson, "This whole
investigation rests

1723
01:34:36,718 --> 01:34:42,213
"unless one of the seven
begins to talk.

1724
01:34:45,026 --> 01:34:46,755
"That's the problem."

1725
01:34:46,828 --> 01:34:50,320
Well, what do we
mean when we say

1726
01:34:50,398 --> 01:34:52,525
"one of the seven
beginning to talk"?

1727
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:55,899
Then moving on to
a conversation you had
with John Dean

1728
01:34:55,970 --> 01:34:57,460
on March 21,
the following year.

1729
01:34:57,538 --> 01:35:00,507
In one transcript alone,
there in black and white,

1730
01:35:00,575 --> 01:35:02,236
I picked out,
and these are your words,

1731
01:35:02,310 --> 01:35:06,041
one,
"You could get $1 million,
and you could get it in cash.

1732
01:35:06,114 --> 01:35:07,547
"I know where it
could be gotten."

1733
01:35:07,615 --> 01:35:10,948
Two, "Your major guy
to keep under control
is Hunt."

1734
01:35:11,552 --> 01:35:14,419
Three,
"Don't we have to handle
the Hunt situation?"

1735
01:35:14,489 --> 01:35:16,286
Four, "Get the million bucks.

1736
01:35:16,357 --> 01:35:18,825
"It would seem to me
that would be worthwhile."

1737
01:35:18,893 --> 01:35:21,691
Five, "Don't you agree
that you'd better get
the Hunt thing going?"

1738
01:35:21,763 --> 01:35:23,594
Six, "First you've got
the Hunt problem.

1739
01:35:23,664 --> 01:35:26,326
"That ought to be handled."
Seven, "The money
can be provided.

1740
01:35:26,401 --> 01:35:28,869
"Ehrlichman could provide
the way to deliver it."

1741
01:35:28,936 --> 01:35:30,631
Eight,
"We've no choice with Hunt

1742
01:35:30,705 --> 01:35:33,572
"but the $1 20,000 or
whatever it is, right?"

1743
01:35:33,641 --> 01:35:37,042
Nine, "Christ,
turn over any cash
we've got."

1744
01:35:37,111 --> 01:35:38,578
And I could go on.
Now, it seems to me

1745
01:35:38,646 --> 01:35:40,307
that someone
running a cover-up

1746
01:35:40,381 --> 01:35:42,406
couldn't have expressed it
more clearly than that,
could they?

1747
01:35:42,483 --> 01:35:44,041
Look, let me
just stop you now
right there,

1748
01:35:44,118 --> 01:35:46,245
because you're doing
something here

1749
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:48,652
which I am not doing,
and I will not do

1750
01:35:48,723 --> 01:35:50,953
throughout these
entire broadcasts.

1751
01:35:51,025 --> 01:35:53,152
You're quoting me
out of context,

1752
01:35:53,227 --> 01:35:55,422
out of order.
And I might add,

1753
01:35:55,496 --> 01:35:57,828
I have participated
in all these interviews

1754
01:35:57,899 --> 01:35:59,696
without a single note
in front of me.

1755
01:35:59,767 --> 01:36:01,257
Well, it is your life,
Mr. President.

1756
01:36:01,335 --> 01:36:02,461
Now, you've always maintained

1757
01:36:02,537 --> 01:36:05,438
that you knew nothing
about any of this
until March 21 .

1758
01:36:05,506 --> 01:36:09,067
But in February,
your personal lawyer
came to Washington

1759
01:36:09,143 --> 01:36:12,203
to start the raising
of $219,000

1760
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:14,271
of hush money to be
paid to the burglars.

1761
01:36:14,348 --> 01:36:17,283
Now, do you seriously
expect us to believe

1762
01:36:17,351 --> 01:36:18,943
that you had
no knowledge of that?

1763
01:36:19,020 --> 01:36:22,319
None. I believed
the money was for
humanitarian purposes.

1764
01:36:22,390 --> 01:36:24,984
To help
disadvantaged people
with their defenses.

1765
01:36:25,059 --> 01:36:28,859
Well, it was being delivered
on the tops of phone booths
with aliases,

1766
01:36:28,930 --> 01:36:31,160
and at airports
by people with gloves on.

1767
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:33,359
That's not normally
the way lawyers' fees
are delivered, is it?

1768
01:36:33,434 --> 01:36:35,959
Look,
I have made statements
to this effect before.

1769
01:36:36,037 --> 01:36:38,232
All that was Haldeman
and Ehrlichman's business.

1770
01:36:38,306 --> 01:36:40,433
I knew nothing.
Okay, fine. Fine!

1771
01:36:40,508 --> 01:36:41,805
You made a conclusion there.

1772
01:36:41,876 --> 01:36:43,468
I stated my view,
now let's move on.

1773
01:36:43,544 --> 01:36:44,636
Let's get on to
the rest of it.

1774
01:36:44,712 --> 01:36:45,736
No, hold on.
No, hold on.

1775
01:36:45,813 --> 01:36:46,802
No, I don't
want to talk...

1776
01:36:46,881 --> 01:36:48,610
If Haldeman and Ehrlichman
were the ones
really responsible,

1777
01:36:48,683 --> 01:36:51,481
when you subsequently
found out about it,

1778
01:36:51,552 --> 01:36:53,611
why didn't you
call the police
and have them arrested?

1779
01:36:53,688 --> 01:36:55,713
Isn't that just
a cover-up of another kind?

1780
01:36:55,790 --> 01:36:57,451
Yeah, maybe I should
have done that.
Maybe I should have.

1781
01:36:57,525 --> 01:36:59,288
Just called the feds
into my office

1782
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:01,487
and said, "Hey,
there's the two men.

1783
01:37:01,562 --> 01:37:03,029
"Haul them
down to the dock,

1784
01:37:03,097 --> 01:37:05,190
"fingerprint them
and then throw them
in the can."

1785
01:37:05,266 --> 01:37:06,392
I'm not made that way.

1786
01:37:06,467 --> 01:37:09,459
These men,
Haldeman, Ehrlichman,
I knew their families.

1787
01:37:09,537 --> 01:37:11,402
I knew them since
they were just kids.

1788
01:37:11,472 --> 01:37:12,769
Yeah, but you know,
politically,

1789
01:37:12,840 --> 01:37:15,741
the pressure on me
to let them go,
that became overwhelming!

1790
01:37:15,810 --> 01:37:18,643
So I did it.
I cut off one arm,

1791
01:37:18,713 --> 01:37:21,443
then I cut off the other,
and I'm not a good butcher!

1792
01:37:21,516 --> 01:37:24,383
And I have always maintained
what they were doing,

1793
01:37:24,452 --> 01:37:26,716
what we were all doing,
was not criminal.

1794
01:37:26,787 --> 01:37:28,345
Look,
when you're in office,

1795
01:37:28,422 --> 01:37:31,687
you gotta do
a lot of things sometimes
that are not always,

1796
01:37:31,759 --> 01:37:35,320
in the strictest sense
of the law, legal,
but you do them

1797
01:37:35,396 --> 01:37:37,626
because they're in
the greater interests

I understand correctly,

that in certain situations,

whether it's in the best
interests of the nation

that means it's not illegal.

Since you've asked me,
I think there
are three things

that people would
like to hear you say.

1875
01:43:12,900 --> 01:43:17,337
One, that there was
probably more than mistakes.

1876
01:43:17,404 --> 01:43:20,339
There was wrongdoing.

1877
01:43:20,407 --> 01:43:23,240
And, yes, it might
have been a crime, too.

1878
01:43:24,545 --> 01:43:29,847
Secondly, that "I did
abuse the power
I had as President."

And thirdly,

you're going to be haunted
for the rest of your life.

1886

Well, it's true.
I made mistakes,
horrendous ones,

1887
01:44:10,057 --> 01:44:13,322
ones that were not
worthy of a president,

1888
01:44:15,329 --> 01:44:18,230

meet the standards
of excellence

that I always dreamed of
as a young boy.

1890
01:44:22,169 --> 01:44:27,835
But, if you remember,
it was a difficult time.

1891
01:44:28,876 --> 01:44:32,869

in a five-front war

there were times

I did not fully meet
that responsibility

1896

in a cover-up,
as you call it.

I have a very deep regret.

on the floor and grovel...

mistakes of the heart.

01:45:22,730 --> 01:45:24,288
They were not
mistakes of the head.

1904

I don't blame anybody.

Mmm-hmm.

1949
01:49:44,324 --> 01:49:45,655
Very sweet.

1950
01:49:56,770 --> 01:49:58,169
(ENGINE STARTING)

1951
01:50:16,657 --> 01:50:19,683
The Nixon<i>I</i>Frost interviews
were wildly successful.

1952
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:22,320
I think they attracted
the largest audience
for a news program

1953
01:50:22,396 --> 01:50:24,091
in the history of
American television.

1954
01:50:24,164 --> 01:50:27,292
<i>David was on</i>
<i>the cover of</i> Time <i>magazine</i>
<i>and</i> Newsweek <i>magazine.</i>

1955
01:50:27,367 --> 01:50:28,629
<i>And even the political</i>
<i>press corps,</i>

1956
01:50:28,702 --> 01:50:29,896
<i>the hard-bitten</i>
<i>political press corps,</i>

1957
01:50:29,970 --> 01:50:32,939
<i>called David up with</i>
<i>messages of contrition</i>
<i>and congratulation.</i>

1958
01:50:33,006 --> 01:50:35,201
David, I want to
say congratulations.

1959
01:50:35,309 --> 01:50:37,140
The interviews?

1960
01:50:37,210 --> 01:50:40,646
No, I didn't watch them.
I couldn't.

1961
01:50:41,448 --> 01:50:42,938
<i>(DISCO MUSIC PLAYING)</i>

1962
01:50:43,016 --> 01:50:44,005
Hey.

1963
01:50:45,886 --> 01:50:47,046
Hello.

1964
01:50:54,795 --> 01:50:58,026
I believe David saw
the former President
just one more time.

1965
01:50:58,098 --> 01:50:59,929
Before he left California
for London again,

1966
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,594
he drove down
to San Clemente
to say goodbye.

1967
01:51:14,781 --> 01:51:18,012
Hey, Mr. Frost.
It's nice to see you.

1968
01:51:18,952 --> 01:51:20,510
Miss Cushing.
Hello.

1969
01:51:21,688 --> 01:51:23,815
Please excuse
my golf outfit.

1970
01:51:23,890 --> 01:51:26,859
It's the official
uniform of the retired.

1971
01:51:28,295 --> 01:51:29,785
Are you on your way home?

1972
01:51:29,863 --> 01:51:31,057
Yes.

1973
01:51:31,131 --> 01:51:36,228
Into a bright new dawn
of fresh enterprises
and challenges, eh?

1974
01:51:36,303 --> 01:51:37,531
Well, let's hope so.

1975
01:51:37,604 --> 01:51:38,798
Good for you.

1976
01:51:38,872 --> 01:51:41,807
I didn't catch
the interviews
as they went out,

1977
01:51:41,875 --> 01:51:45,504
but they tell me
that they were
a great success.

1978
01:51:45,579 --> 01:51:49,310
I gather the journalists
that were so positive

1979
01:51:49,383 --> 01:51:52,375
about you weren't
so kind to me.

1980
01:51:52,452 --> 01:51:55,444
Yes, I was sorry to see that.

1981
01:51:56,123 --> 01:51:58,387
There's no
condolences necessary.

1982
01:51:58,458 --> 01:52:01,018
I've grown to
expect nothing else
from those sons of whores.

1983
01:52:01,094 --> 01:52:02,789
Yeah.

1984
01:52:02,896 --> 01:52:06,059
Jeez, please forgive me,
Miss Cushing.

1985
01:52:06,466 --> 01:52:09,629
You know,
I would've said
"sons of bitches,"

1986
01:52:09,703 --> 01:52:12,331
but Manolo here
is a lover of dogs,

1987
01:52:12,406 --> 01:52:14,704
and he hates me
to defame animals.

1988
01:52:15,175 --> 01:52:16,802
Can I get something
for somebody?

1989
01:52:16,877 --> 01:52:19,311
Yes. Would you like
some tea or champagne?

1990
01:52:19,379 --> 01:52:22,610
Hey, you know,
we got that caviar
the Shah of Iran sent me.

1991
01:52:22,682 --> 01:52:23,740
No, thank you.
You sure?

1992
01:52:23,817 --> 01:52:25,114
Come on. It'll be
no trouble at all.

1993
01:52:25,185 --> 01:52:26,413
No, really, we must be...

1994
01:52:26,486 --> 01:52:30,183
Okay, fine, fine.
Thanks for coming by.

1995
01:52:33,260 --> 01:52:35,490
You were a worthy opponent.

1996
01:52:37,497 --> 01:52:38,657
Goodbye, Mr. President.

1997
01:52:38,732 --> 01:52:40,029
Bye-bye.

1998
01:52:40,100 --> 01:52:41,499
Goodbye, Mr. President.

1999
01:52:41,568 --> 01:52:42,592
Goodbye.

2000
01:52:44,337 --> 01:52:46,965
Oh, God!
I almost forgot. I...

2001
01:52:47,974 --> 01:52:53,879
I brought you a present,
those shoes you admired.

2002
01:52:54,181 --> 01:52:55,944
I brought you a pair.

2003
01:52:57,117 --> 01:53:00,109
Well, jeez. Thank you.

2004
01:53:04,825 --> 01:53:09,990
I'm touched. Safe trip, now.

2005
01:53:14,367 --> 01:53:20,101
Oh! Say, David, you think
I could speak to you,
privately, just for a minute?

2006
01:53:31,451 --> 01:53:34,045
Do you know those
parties of yours?

2007
01:53:34,121 --> 01:53:36,589
The ones that I read about
in all the papers?

2008
01:53:36,656 --> 01:53:39,386
Do you actually enjoy those?

2009
01:53:40,293 --> 01:53:41,658
Of course.

2010
01:53:43,196 --> 01:53:47,098
You got no idea how
fortunate that makes you.

2011
01:53:48,268 --> 01:53:52,568
You know?
Liking people,
and being liked.

2012
01:53:52,639 --> 01:53:57,303
Having that facility,
that lightness, that charm.

2013
01:53:58,778 --> 01:54:01,212
I don't have it.
I never did.

2014
01:54:02,015 --> 01:54:04,848
It kind of makes you wonder
why I chose a life

2015
01:54:04,918 --> 01:54:08,012
that hinged on being liked.

2016
01:54:08,321 --> 01:54:11,722
I'm better suited
to a life of thought,

2017
01:54:11,791 --> 01:54:14,021
debate,
intellectual discipline.

2018
01:54:15,061 --> 01:54:16,289
Maybe we got it wrong.

2019
01:54:16,363 --> 01:54:18,228
Maybe you should have
been a politician

2020
01:54:18,298 --> 01:54:20,630
and I the rigorous
interviewer.

2021
01:54:21,268 --> 01:54:22,530
Maybe.

2022
01:54:23,970 --> 01:54:25,096
David.

2023
01:54:27,440 --> 01:54:30,898
Did I really
call you that night?

2024
01:54:33,246 --> 01:54:34,440
Yes.

2025
01:54:35,348 --> 01:54:39,182
Did we discuss
anything important?

2026
01:54:43,456 --> 01:54:44,923
Cheeseburgers.

2027
01:54:47,327 --> 01:54:48,885
Cheeseburgers?

2028
01:54:54,601 --> 01:54:56,091
Goodbye, sir.

2029
01:55:06,279 --> 01:55:08,440
<i>RESTON. Well, New York,</i>
<i>London and Sydney</i>

2030
01:55:08,515 --> 01:55:10,949
<i>welcomed David</i>
<i>back with open arms,</i>

2031
01:55:11,017 --> 01:55:12,746
<i>as did his friends</i>
<i>and investors,</i>

2032
01:55:12,819 --> 01:55:15,287
<i>who've made a fortune</i>
<i>from these interviews.</i>

2033
01:55:15,355 --> 01:55:16,947
<i>He got back all of his shows.</i>

2034
01:55:17,023 --> 01:55:19,287
<i>He even got back</i>
<i>his table at Sardi's.</i>

2035
01:55:20,060 --> 01:55:21,425
<i>As for Richard Nixon,</i>

2036
01:55:21,494 --> 01:55:22,722
<i>well, he certainly</i>
<i>never achieved</i>

2037
01:55:22,796 --> 01:55:25,492
<i>the rehabilitation</i>
<i>he so desperately craved.</i>

2038
01:55:25,565 --> 01:55:27,726
His most lasting legacy

2039
01:55:27,801 --> 01:55:30,599
is that today
any political wrongdoing

2040
01:55:30,704 --> 01:55:33,502
is immediately given
the suffix "gate."
