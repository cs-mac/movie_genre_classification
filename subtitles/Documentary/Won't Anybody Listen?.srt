2
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:53,217
This is the beginning of the tape.

3
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:58,386
We're on mono and we're on microphone 1.

4
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:02,309
Okay.

5
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:03,553
Now listen,

6
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:06,147
let me tell you something that I did.

7
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,318
I've had my head digitized.

8
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,820
And they put this laser

9
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:14,735
and it goes around you like this...

10
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,823
and they digitized my face.

11
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:18,909
And I made a lot of faces

12
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,241
and smiled and...

13
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:23,660
and made a sad face and...

14
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,784
So they've got it all on digital.

15
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,457
And actors are not going to be real,

16
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,922
they're going to be inside a computer.

17
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,458
You watch, it's gonna happen.

18
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:37,178
So maybe this is the swan song
for all of us.

19
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:08,410
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow...

20
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,503
creeps in this petty pace

21
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,123
from day to day,

22
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,884
to the last syllable of recorded time;

23
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,505
And all our yesterdays

24
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:23,884
have lighted fools the way
to dusty death.

25
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:28,767
Out, out, brief candle.

26
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:31,854
Life's but a walking shadow,

27
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:36,776
a poor player, that struts
and frets his hour upon the stage,

28
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:39,440
and then is heard no more.

29
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:44,363
It is a tale told by an idiot,

30
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:48,458
full of sound

31
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:52,454
and fury, signifying...

32
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:56,837
nothing.

33
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:02,964
Copy. All available
units responding to a shooting.

34
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,343
Police came to a call to 911,

35
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:08,561
but this was no ordinary address,

36
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,851
the caller no ordinary citizen.

37
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:13,520
Marlon Brando was on the line

38
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:15,689
to report a shooting at his home.

39
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:18,404
Misery...

40
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,069
has come to my house.

41
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,698
Brando won an Oscar

42
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,325
for his performance in the 1954 film.

43
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,496
<i>On the Waterfront.</i>

44
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,244
He was already being acclaimed

45
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,997
as the greatest American
film actor ever.

46
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,375
You take the good goods away,
and the kickbacks

47
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:39,793
and the shakedown cabbage

48
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:42,261
and them pistoleros and you're nothin'.

49
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,803
Hey, Stella.

50
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,392
You can bet that Marlon Brando's impact

51
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,681
on the world of movie acting

52
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,850
will still be felt 500 years from now.

53
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,561
I'm gonna make him an offer
he can't refuse.

54
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:57,985
Marlon Brando was here

55
00:03:58,113 --> 00:03:59,649
at his home at the time of the shooting,

56
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:02,990
but police who questioned the actor
say he did not witness it.

57
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,615
The shooting
put a spotlight on the private life

58
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:10,115
of one of Hollywood's
most reclusive stars.

59
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,707
And it's been a struggle

60
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:13,792
to try to preserve sanity

61
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,544
and sense of reality

62
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,415
that is taken away from you by success.

63
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:41,359
It will be
a highly personalized documentary

64
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:45,825
on the life activities of myself,
Marlon Brando.

65
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,203
We establish that he is a troubled man,

66
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:56,961
alone, beset with memories,

67
00:04:57,088 --> 00:05:01,958
in a state of confusion and sadness,

68
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,801
isolation, disorder.

69
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:10,049
He's wounded beyond being able

70
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:12,890
to be social in an ordinary way,

71
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:16,105
he becomes like a mechanical doll.

72
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,353
Maybe he felt that he was treated badly.

73
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:24,648
And that he's angry about the treatment.

74
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:29,365
He's collecting bits
of information here, odd bits of film

75
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:32,785
to try to explain why are you this way?

76
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:42,340
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

77
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:47,428
five, four, three, two, one.

78
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:52,850
Now let your mind drift

79
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,226
back,

80
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:56,353
way back in time

81
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,019
to a time when you were very young,

82
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:03,144
when you used to wake up in the morning,

83
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,737
put on your clothes

84
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,572
while everyone was sleeping,

85
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:11,653
and walk down the sidewalk in Omaha

86
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,368
and sit underneath that big elm tree.

87
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,789
With the wind blowing the light,

88
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,661
the shadow of leaves.

89
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:25,375
It is like a wonderful, soft dream

90
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,251
and that soft wind calling.

91
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,888
That's a wind that you can trust.

92
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,310
You are the memories.

93
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,863
I've always in my life had

94
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:52,110
a strong sense that I had to be free.

95
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:56,622
Standing on that train, I was free.

96
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,786
I used to love to stand in the car

97
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,663
and listen to the rails.

98
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:11,597
You know?

99
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:13,680
It's an eccentric kind of rhythm.

100
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:20,855
I arrived in New York with holes
in my socks and holes in my mind.

101
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:27,149
I remember getting drunk,

102
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,988
lying down on the sidewalk
and going to sleep.

103
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,778
Nobody bothered me.

104
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,997
I was always somebody who had

105
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,458
an unquenchable curiosity about people.

106
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,294
I liked to walk down the street
and look at faces.

107
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:48,083
I used to go to the corner
of Broadway and 42nd Street

108
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,631
in an Optimo cigar store.

109
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:54,468
I would watch people for three seconds
as they went by

110
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,683
and try to analyze their personality

111
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,677
by just that flick.

112
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:05,145
The face can hide many things.

113
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:08,565
And people are always hiding things.

114
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,239
I was interested to guess

115
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:15,531
the things that people
did not know about themselves.

116
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:20,748
What they feel, what they think,
why they feel.

117
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:24,368
How is it that we behave the way we do?

118
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,999
What is the answer?

119
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,624
Is there any answer?

120
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,672
There is something
that you need very deeply.

121
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,841
Some kind of contact,

122
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:38,262
some experience
to give you a sense of fulfillment.

123
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,970
I had a great feeling of inadequacy,

124
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,392
that I didn't know enough,

125
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,016
that I didn't have enough education.

126
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,270
I felt dumb.

127
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:04,166
I became an actor

128
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,411
pretty much by accident.

129
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:08,955
I went to the New School
for Social Research,

130
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,879
which is an extraordinary institution
of learning.

131
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,344
My teachers were all Jewish,

132
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:18,260
because the New School
was a clearing house

133
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:21,926
for Jews that escaped from Hitler.

134
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,475
They were very respected people.

135
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,477
The cream of academia.

136
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:32,190
Control over your lives

137
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,655
begins with this class.

138
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:36,194
I studied with a woman

139
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:38,818
by the name of Stella Adler.

140
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,615
She was a fine actress,

141
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:43,285
a really wonderful actress.

142
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,996
The smell of the greasepaint

143
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,835
and lure of the theatrical experience

144
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,751
came out in her teaching technique.

145
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:53,749
The play has nothing to do with words.

146
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,418
You do not act words,

147
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,507
you act with your soul.

148
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,297
I was very shy when I was a kid.

149
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,925
Sensitive, very sensitive.

150
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,142
In the theater,

151
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,803
the actor is the boss.

152
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:10,684
It's against the nature of human life
to withdraw.

153
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,815
"Don't be afraid," she said.

154
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,064
"You have a right to be who you are,

155
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:18,191
where you are and how you are."

156
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:22,115
Be in a state of honesty up there.

157
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,910
Allowing yourself to feel things,

158
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,283
to feel love or to feel rage.

159
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,284
Speak out the thoughts

160
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,036
that are tormenting you.

161
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,332
Everybody's got a story to tell,

162
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:36,171
something they're hiding.

163
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,466
Do not bring anything
in the present

164
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,177
that doesn't have the past.

165
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,722
We develop the technique
of acting very, very early.

166
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:47,641
Even from the time we're a kid,

167
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,934
where we're throwing our oatmeal
on the floor

168
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,399
just to get attention from our mothers.

169
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:55,486
Acting is surviving.

170
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,996
Yeah, that's my mother.

171
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:07,535
That photograph there.

172
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,119
This is a portrait of my mom

173
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,246
when she was about forty.

174
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:16,419
And she was a marvellous person.

175
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:21,592
For instance, she dressed up a pet goose
we had for Santa Claus.

176
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,096
She made a Santa Claus out of it,

177
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,886
made a little red costume for it

178
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,509
and a beard and everything.

179
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:29,846
She was a very inventive
and artistic woman.

180
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,893
And I miss her very much.

181
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,228
I was given by my mother

182
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,150
a sense of the absurd.

183
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:42,783
She had false teeth.

184
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:44,118
Once in a while she'd laugh.

185
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,486
While she was laughing,

186
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:48,080
her teeth would come off her gums.

187
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,208
And the more I laughed,

188
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,950
the more she thought it was funny

189
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,873
and we both ended up laughing real hard.

190
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:04,301
My mother taught me a love for nature,

191
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:09,552
and a sense of closeness with animals.

192
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,596
You couldn't think of a tune

193
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:15,357
she couldn't play on the piano.

194
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:16,851
Not one.

195
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:20,525
I like remembering about her.

196
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:27,161
I used to love the smell of liquor
on her breath.

197
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:30,622
And her breath becomes very, very sweet.

198
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,163
It's a lovely fragrance.

199
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,668
My mother was an alcoholic.

200
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,464
We lived in a small town

201
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,008
and my mother was the town drunk.

202
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:49,300
She began to dissolve

203
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,427
and fray at the ends.

204
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,057
When my mother was missing.

205
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,900
Gone off someplace,
we didn't know where she was.

206
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,651
I used to have to go
and get her out of jail.

207
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,111
Memories even now

208
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:08,532
that fill me with shame and anger.

209
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,791
You have to constantly act.

210
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,581
It is not important

211
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:19,296
to defend your faults in the theater.

212
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:22,041
It's important to overcome them.

213
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:27,888
Stella very kindly invited me
into her home.

214
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:31,805
I then became part of her family.

215
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:36,059
When I was really suffering

216
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,978
and disjointed, disoriented with life,

217
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:42,486
she was always very loving towards me.

218
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,443
I'd never done anything in life

219
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:49,194
that anybody ever said I was good at.

220
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,571
She put her hand on my shoulders

221
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:53,743
and said, "Don't worry, my boy."

222
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,999
"I have seen you,

223
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:59,120
and the world is going to hear from you."

224
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,591
From the T-shirt clad Stanley Kowalski

225
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:13,012
in <i>Streetcar Named Desire,</i>

226
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,761
the role which catapulted him
to international fame,

227
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,679
we're very pleased
to have with us this morning

228
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,189
as our guest Mr Marlon Brando.

229
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,778
<i>Streetcar Named Desire</i>
was very satisfying to be in,

230
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,151
because I thought
it was a wonderful play.

231
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,234
The story was superb

232
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,781
and the production was wonderful.

233
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,280
You must be Stanley.

234
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:37,749
Oh, hiya. Where's the little woman?

235
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:42,213
It was a very explosive part

236
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,502
and it electrified everybody.

237
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:45,795
You want a shot?

238
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,506
No, I rarely touch it.

239
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,800
Well, some people, they rarely touch it,

240
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,597
but it touches them often.

241
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,221
I was quite nutty
when I was young

242
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:57,561
and I would have a lot of energy.

243
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,438
Rain forever.

244
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,352
'Cause you couldn't come out flat,

245
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:03,020
you couldn't come out slow.

246
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,609
After the play was over,

247
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,603
I felt like a million bucks.

248
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,819
I was off into the night

249
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,654
with sparkles and zest

250
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,740
to see whatever I could find.

251
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,157
How wonderful it was to drive around

252
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:21,000
on a motorcycle with just a T-shirt on.

253
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,746
Two, three, four o'clock in the morning.

254
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:29,260
Some small club
in the black section of town.

255
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,253
And I was screaming

256
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,096
when they were playing those drums.

257
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,136
I'd hear that shit,

258
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:40,388
it just used to take me to another land.

259
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,105
This is my moment,

260
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:43,644
I want to take this moment

261
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,439
and that was wonderful.

262
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,606
And then your life changes.

263
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,074
Suddenly, there's a lot more girls

264
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,034
saying, "Hi, Mar."

265
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:57,530
When I was younger,

266
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:00,290
I was a fairly attractive kid.

267
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:03,456
I had a lot of derring-do and panache.

268
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:07,252
I was unpredictable and stimulating

269
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,669
for a lot of young girls.

270
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:17,050
I was young and destined
to spread my seed far and wide.

271
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:19,598
Girls and fun and good food

272
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:22,767
and sense of health and purpose...

273
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,731
It can't get better than this.

274
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:28,235
Nothing in life
could be better than this.

275
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:32,360
I was always making jokes and teasing,

276
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,860
playing practical jokes on everybody.

277
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,507
To be able to have money.

278
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,001
I never had any money.

279
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,842
My father was a traveling salesman.

280
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:59,805
I was making more in six months of work

281
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:01,677
than he made in ten years.

282
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:04,429
He measured everything by money.

283
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:07,729
He couldn't understand
how this ne'er-do-well son of his

284
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,522
could possibly do that.

285
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,114
If I have a scene to play

286
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:16,654
and I have to be angry,

287
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:20,575
there must be within you trigger
mechanisms that are spring-loaded,

288
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:24,199
that are filled with contempt
about something.

289
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:27,290
I remember my father hitting my mother.

290
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:28,795
I was fourteen.

291
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:37,554
Now that's how
I'm gonna clear the table.

292
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,717
Don't you ever talk that way to me.

293
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,266
My old man was tough.

294
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:46,809
He was a bar fighter.

295
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:49,809
He was a man with not much love in him.

296
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,478
Staying away from home,

297
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:55,822
drinking and whoring
all around the Midwest.

298
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:58,442
He used to slap me around,

299
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,240
and for no good reason.

300
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:03,785
And I was truly intimidated by him
at that time.

301
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,325
Now what kind of a queen
do you think you are?

302
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,543
You know that I've been onto you
from the start,

303
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:11,789
and not once did you pull the wool
over this boy's eyes.

304
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,667
When things
are extremely painful to you,

305
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,794
you don't want them
in your consciousness,

306
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,795
you want to forget about them.

307
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,388
And you are the Queen of the Nile,

308
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,599
sitting on your throne,
swilling down my liquor.

309
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:25,686
You know what I say? Ha-ha!

310
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:29,394
You can imagine
having to go someplace every night

311
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,811
and go through all that,

312
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:32,442
get yourself upset...

313
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,778
To have to cry or to scream

314
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:38,694
or to be ruined in some way,
that's work.

315
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,113
That's hard work.

316
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,988
People invariably associated me
with the part I played,

317
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:47,624
so that it was difficult to believe
that I didn't eat off the floor,

318
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:52,463
or that I, you know, didn't run up
the street with my shoes off,

319
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:56,004
and so it's been a hard thing
sort of living that down.

320
00:18:56,844 --> 00:19:00,428
There is nothing about me
that is like Stanley Kowalski.

321
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:01,922
I hate that kinda guy.

322
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,799
I absolutely hate that person

323
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:06,221
and I couldn't identify with it.

324
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:12,233
The brute, dark character that
represented the beasts and the animals.

325
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,986
They sent me to a psychiatrist.

326
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,855
They thought I was going nuts,

327
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:21,275
losing my mind.

328
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,527
Stella told me,
if you come to the theater

329
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:26,781
and you feel a hundred percent,
show eighty.

330
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:30,705
If you come and you feel sixty percent,
show forty.

331
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,165
If you come to the theater

332
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,459
and you only feel forty percent,

333
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,833
best to turn around and go home.

334
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,176
I was wondering if you have any plans

335
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,591
to return to the stage
in the near future.

336
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:48,560
No, I don't have any immediate
intentions of returning to the stage.

337
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,988
The shouts of freedom

338
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:03,575
are also the rattling of chains.

339
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:09,456
You seem to be such a restless man.

340
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,870
Eyes always darting.

341
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,209
I don't know,

342
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:16,125
I guess I've just got loose feet.

343
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:22,503
I infer from that that you
do not thoroughly enjoy your profession.

344
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,467
Or you don't enjoy it at all.

345
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,931
No, I think that people
do what they enjoy,

346
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,266
or else they don't do it.

347
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,351
People do what they want to do.

348
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,394
If there are adverse conditions
that surround my work,

349
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:36,141
they are not adverse enough

350
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,901
to make me change activities.

351
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:44,737
If I hadn't had the good luck
to be an actor,

352
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:47,828
I don't know what I would've been.

353
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,867
I'd have probably been a con man.

354
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,582
A good con man.

355
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:57,171
Tell smooth lies, give impressions
of things that he thinks,

356
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:00,423
or appears to think
that he doesn't think.

357
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,967
Since I don't do anything else well,

358
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,462
and up to this time I haven't decided

359
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:06,930
what else I would like to do,

360
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,844
I might as well put all my energies

361
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,389
into being as good an actor as I can.

362
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,771
Now will you turn your head for us?

363
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,107
Sure.

364
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:20,193
Now around the other way.

365
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,815
Now all the way around.

366
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:34,162
All right. Thank you and stay around.

367
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:37,669
Shakespeare said,

368
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,459
"There is no art to find

369
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,707
the mind's construction in the face."

370
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,425
And there should be such an art.

371
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,843
When the camera is close on you,

372
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,762
your face becomes the stage.

373
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:54,511
Your face is the proscenium arch

374
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:56,889
of the theater, thirty feet high.

375
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,934
And it sees all the little movements

376
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:03,483
of the face and the eye and the mouth.

377
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:06,197
You have the intensity to act.

378
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:10,319
I wanted very much

379
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:13,367
to be involved in motion pictures,

380
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,035
so I could change it

381
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:17,451
into something nearer the truth.

382
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:20,203
And I was convinced
that I could do that.

383
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,798
About my playing the tuba...

384
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:26,259
Seems like a lot of fuss
has been made about that.

385
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,090
In the '30s and '40s

386
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:30,635
you had a particular kind of acting.

387
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,053
You knew who you were gonna get

388
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,017
when you went to the movies.

389
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,975
Gary Cooper oats.

390
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:39,810
Shredded Wheat Bogart.

391
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:43,401
Clark Gable Crunchy Fruit Loops.

392
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,270
They were just like breakfast cereals.

393
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,401
The same in every role.

394
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:52,111
Gestures of anguish and despair,

395
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:55,205
and that kind of acting became absurd.

396
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,372
The astounding thing

397
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:01,915
most people don't realize.

398
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,672
All motion pictures today,

399
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,257
all acting today,

400
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:08,510
stems from Stella Adler.

401
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:12,138
Stella, so much
has been talked about Method acting.

402
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:14,098
What exactly is the Method?

403
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:17,810
All right, let's start at the beginning.

404
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,271
Stella went to Paris

405
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:23,775
and studied
with Konstantin Stanislavsky,

406
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,314
the great Russian teacher,

407
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,230
brought back
her experience and knowledge

408
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,444
of this particular form of acting.

409
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:35,321
Reality, realness, carried by an actor

410
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,326
to achieve the truth.

411
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,957
This is the most modern technique.

412
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,411
Everything that you do,

413
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:43,787
make it real as you can.

414
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:46,165
Make it alive, make it tangible,

415
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,667
find the truth of that moment.

416
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:51,169
Mr Stanislavsky understood that.

417
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:55,303
And the style of acting
changed completely.

418
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:59,515
The first movie I ever did
was called <i>The Men.</i>

419
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:01,354
I played a paraplegic

420
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,933
and lived in a hospital
with paraplegics for three weeks.

421
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:08,733
Physicality is a tough thing.

422
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:12,820
I spent a lot of time just studying
everything they do.

423
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:15,990
I wanted to see how
they got in and out of their chairs.

424
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:19,156
The manner in which you crawled
from one place to another.

425
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:23,827
Paraplegics,
they do the most amazing things.

426
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:26,205
Races without their chairs,

427
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,081
I've seen guys walk on their hands.

428
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:29,628
They can do one-armed pull-ups,

429
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:31,043
they can do everything.

430
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,840
You have to know your subject,

431
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,588
you have to know your character.

432
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,761
Putting yourself
in a different state of mind.

433
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,846
What they felt like,

434
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:41,390
what their frustrations were

435
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,805
knowing that they couldn't have sex.

436
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:46,399
What am I gonna do, where am I gonna go?

437
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,523
I can't go out there anymore.

438
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:54,028
He just sits there
and he marinates his mind.

439
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,947
In the intellect; That's all he's got.

440
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,365
Put your heart into it.

441
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:00,701
Get yourself up emotionally.

442
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,704
At night I think about it,

443
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:05,043
dream about it

444
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:07,829
and I wake up being absorbed by it.

445
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:09,672
People have routines:

446
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,668
Acting routines, dancing routines,
painting routines.

447
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:15,136
The same thing over and over again.

448
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,677
Everything is a cliché.

449
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:21,844
When an actor takes a little too long
as he's walking to the door,

450
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:24,141
you know he's going to stop
and turn around and say...

451
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:27,141
"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn."

452
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:29,438
Jersey Joe Walcott, terrific fighter.

453
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:33,195
He'd be boxing, he'd be throwing
some punches and bing!

454
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,402
He'd have his fist in somebody's face.

455
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:37,442
You'd think it was coming out
of the southwest

456
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,451
and there it comes out of the northeast.

457
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,531
He would never let you know
where he was going to hit you.

458
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:43,949
You.

459
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:47,919
Never let the audience know
how it's gonna come out.

460
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:49,047
What is your name?

461
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:51,085
Get them on your time.

462
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:55,426
Emiliano Zapata.

463
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:01,349
And when that time comes
and everything is right,

464
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,893
you just fuck, let fly.

465
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:07,310
O judgment, thou art fled
to brutish beasts,

466
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:09,228
and men have lost their reason.

467
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,895
Hit them, knock them over.

468
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:13,145
With an attitude,

469
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,942
with a word, with a look.

470
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,315
I don't like cops.

471
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:18,658
Be surprising.

472
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:21,324
Figure out a way to do it

473
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:22,946
that has never been done before.

474
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,618
You gotta put something down,

475
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,786
you gotta make some jive.

476
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,705
Don't you know what I'm talking about?

477
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:31,796
You want to stop that movement
from the popcorn to the mouth.

478
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:37,670
Cry "Havoc,"
and let slip the dogs of war.

479
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:39,592
Get people to stop chewing.

480
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:44,468
That this foul deed
shall smell above the earth.

481
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:46,682
The truth will do that.

482
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,686
Damn, damn, damn, damn.

483
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:52,400
When it's right, it's right.

484
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,102
You can feel it in your bones.

485
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,904
Then you feel whole,

486
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,489
then you feel good.

487
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,406
It was pre-sixties.

488
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:05,656
People were looking for rebellion,

489
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:08,704
and I happened to be at the right place
at the right time

490
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:10,702
with the right state of mind.

491
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:14,881
In a sense, it was my own story.

492
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:17,466
Rebelling for the sake of rebelling.

493
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:37,775
Hello, Mr Brando.

494
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:40,865
I hope you don't think
I'm too crazy for making this recording.

495
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:42,575
I wrote you a fan letter once,

496
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,451
but I don't know if you received it.

497
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:49,540
Once I saw a picture of you
with a white cat. Was it yours?

498
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:53,545
I'll bet you're one of the kindest,
most interesting fellows in Hollywood.

499
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:55,797
I suppose I'm judging the book
by the cover,

500
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:58,712
but perhaps I'm not too far wrong.

501
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:01,712
Mr Brando?
I hope this isn't too personal,

502
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:05,056
but I always say what I think,
so I won't stop now.

503
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,517
I admire you very much,

504
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:09,560
both as an actor and a person.

505
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:12,263
Many, many other people
feel the same way.

506
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,482
I think one of the main reasons
that I admire you

507
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,602
is because you aren't afraid
to be yourself,

508
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:19,441
instead of being a carbon copy
of everyone else.

509
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:20,939
It would be a pretty dull world

510
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,815
if everyone behaved in the same way,

511
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:25,785
so three cheers for you, Mr Brando.

512
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:34,828
I didn't intend to have
that extraordinary effect.

513
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:39,754
I became, very quickly, a cult hero.

514
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:55,311
And now I know that you're as anxious
as I am to find out what actor

515
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:59,652
has won the Oscar
for the best performance of this year.

516
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,729
The winner is.

517
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:04,615
Marlon Brando for <i>On the Waterfront.</i>

518
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:09,579
Marlon Brando,

519
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,910
an actor of very considerable talent.

520
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:15,001
The youngest actor
ever honoured in this way.

521
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,123
When I saw the picture finally,

522
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:21,921
I was so embarrassed,

523
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:24,419
so disappointed in my performance.

524
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:28,844
It's much heavier than I imagined.

525
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:32,810
It's like carrying a monkey around
on your back.

526
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:36,181
They're asking me to put the finger
on my own brother.

527
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:41,319
It's a very strange thing
this business of storytelling.

528
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,525
You don't always know when you're good.

529
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:46,653
You wanna hear my philosophy of life?

530
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:52,197
Do it to him before he does it to you.

531
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,574
People will mythologize you

532
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,497
no matter what you do.

533
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:00,163
There's something absurd about it,

534
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,416
that people go with hard-earned cash

535
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:05,168
into a darkened room

536
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:08,675
where they sit
and they look at a crystalline screen

537
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:12,638
upon which images move around
and speak.

538
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,972
And the reason they don't have light
in the theater

539
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:20,100
is because you are there
with your fantasy.

540
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:23,190
The person up on the screen

541
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:26,360
is doing all the things
that you want to do,

542
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,483
they're kissing the woman
you want to kiss,

543
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,325
hitting the people you want to hit,

544
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:33,488
being brave in a way
that you want to be brave.

545
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:38,293
The audience will lend themselves
to the subject.

546
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:42,585
They will create things
that are not there.

547
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:44,628
Listen to me, Terry, take the job.

548
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,717
Just take it. No questions, take it.

549
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:50,051
There are times I know
I did much better acting

550
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:52,219
than in that scene
from <i>On the Waterfront.</i>

551
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:53,717
You don't understand.

552
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:55,726
I coulda had class.

553
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:57,683
I coulda been a contender.

554
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,973
I coulda been somebody.

555
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,691
Instead of a bum.

556
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:05,065
Which is what I am, let's face it.

557
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:08,361
It had nothing to do with me.

558
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:10,233
The audience does the work,

559
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,452
they are doing the acting.

560
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:15,196
Everybody feels like they're a failure,

561
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:18,788
everybody feels
they could've been a contender.

562
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:20,660
Inferiority.

563
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:23,871
I've been very close to it all my life.

564
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,678
Marlon,
I know your dad is in town tonight.

565
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:32,638
Is he hiding out somewhere?

566
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:34,758
No, I'll get him in here. Pop?

567
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:36,267
Come on out.

568
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:38,762
We'll ask Mr Brando
some questions about his son

569
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:41,647
and I'm sure we'll get
the blunt and direct answers.

570
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:43,016
Good evening, Mr Brando.

571
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:46,610
I imagine you're just a bit proud
of your son right now, aren't you?

572
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:52,158
Well, as an actor not too proud,

573
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:55,244
but as a man, why, quite proud.

574
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:56,829
Mr Brando, tell me this.

575
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,407
Was he hard to handle as a child?

576
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:01,785
I think he had the usual...

577
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:05,330
childhood traits.

578
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,798
I think he had probably a little more

579
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:11,761
trouble with his parents
than most children do.

580
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,388
Marlon, in the interests
of justice and fairness,

581
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:17,429
would you like 30 seconds
to defend yourself?

582
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:19,553
Well, I don't feel
I need to defend myself.

583
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:22,351
I can lick this guy with one hand, so...

584
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,061
Let it go.

585
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:30,105
We had an act
we put on for each other.

586
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,072
I played the loving son

587
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,819
and they played the adoring parents.

588
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:38,784
There was a lot of hypocrisy.

589
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:44,248
When what you are as a child
is unwanted, it's unwelcome,

590
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:48,544
then you look for an identity
that will be acceptable.

591
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:53,136
So I had a wide variety
of performances in me.

592
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,763
I'm very anxious for you.

593
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:58,929
I know you haven't seen
all of the footage,

594
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,222
but your light comedy performance

595
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:04,267
in <i>Guys and Dolls</i>
is really terrific, Marlon.

596
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,435
Well, I hope so.

597
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,229
I'm very anxious to see it.

598
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,226
In fact, I'm dying to see it.

599
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,649
How was Vegas?

600
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:14,364
Paradise. For two weeks I gambled
in green pastures,

601
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:15,574
the dice were my cousins

602
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:18,820
and the dolls were agreeable
with nice teeth and no last names.

603
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:21,410
You don't believe I'm a sinner, do you?

604
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:24,659
I'm prepared to believe that you are the
biggest sinner I ever met in my life.

605
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:29,293
It's part of an actor's trade
to be able to play in a light vein

606
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:33,543
and be an entertainer
as well as a serious storyteller.

607
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:38,719
And I feel that I perhaps have neglected
that part of my career up to this point.

608
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:43,853
When I go to set I have a lot of fun,
because it's a gay affair.

609
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,513
It's pleasant to look forward to,

610
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:47,140
it's a nice way to spend your day,

611
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:51,064
rather than be in the middle of a miasma
of seriousness and gravity.

612
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:55,903
As a kid, when I used to sell bottles
and cut lawns

613
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:59,615
to get my ten cents to go to the movie,

614
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,863
and I would escape everything.

615
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,874
That sense of good feeling,

616
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:12,211
that got me through the week.

617
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:16,336
Those moments were magical.

618
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:25,178
The glittering world premiere
at New York's Capitol Theater

619
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:30,183
for Samuel Goldwyn's multi-million
dollar production of <i>Guys and Dolls.</i>

620
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:34,775
<i>♪ Your eyes are the eyes</i>

621
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:38,570
<i>♪ of a woman in love</i>

622
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:45,245
<i>♪ And oh, how they give you away</i>

623
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:49,623
<i>♪ Why try to deny...</i>

624
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:53,464
Most actors
want to get their name in the paper.

625
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:56,551
They like all that attention.

626
00:34:57,512 --> 00:35:01,426
I very often am struck
with the illusion of success.

627
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,475
Sometimes it's difficult
when you meet people

628
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:07,266
because you see
that they have prejudged you,

629
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:09,684
not to be treated normally.

630
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:13,730
To have people staring at you
like an animal in a zoo,

631
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:17,026
or some strange creature
from a distant land.

632
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:20,816
What it does is remove you from reality.

633
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:29,959
I can't stand it. I hate it.

634
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:32,745
I had no idea of how discomforting it is

635
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:36,006
not to be able to be
just an ordinary person.

636
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:38,509
You can't imagine
how much of a panic it is.

637
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:39,878
Really, it scared me to death,

638
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:41,379
because they were hanging on,

639
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:44,222
they could've been run over or crushed.
It really is...

640
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,850
I've never seen
a really hysterical crowd.

641
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,344
It's a frightening experience.

642
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:58,066
Relax, Marlon.

643
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,855
And breathe deeply now.

644
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:07,496
You don't need to feel frightened,

645
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:09,832
you don't need to be nervous.

646
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:21,510
You're very, very comfortable.

647
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:26,349
Deeply safe,
like when you were with Ermi,

648
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:29,469
when you slept in her arms,

649
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,561
when you received affection.

650
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,852
Remember those feelings.

651
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:41,110
She was a governess
hired by my mother.

652
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:45,326
Lovely Oriental skin.

653
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,661
She had very fine hair.

654
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,577
She was sleeping,

655
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:53,622
and through the windows
came the moonlight,

656
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:56,666
and illuminated her body.

657
00:36:57,799 --> 00:37:02,715
I remember arranging myself
on her, over her,

658
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:06,305
and thinking that she was all mine,

659
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:08,550
that she belonged to me alone.

660
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:16,437
Everybody wants a guarantee
that their love is going to be returned.

661
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:18,525
"I'm going to love you till I die

662
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,487
and we're going to love each other
forever."

663
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:26,826
All of those adolescent and childish
concepts of what love ought to be.

664
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:32,539
I remember the night she left.

665
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:33,953
She went away to get married,

666
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,247
but to a seven-year-old mind,

667
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,245
having been with someone intimately,

668
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:41,920
it was tantamount to desertion.

669
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:45,086
In a sense, my mother left me,

670
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:47,467
because she was alcoholic.

671
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,261
And so did Ermi.

672
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:56,764
It was from that date that I became
a miscreant, badly behaved.

673
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:04,109
- Okay.
- Okay.

674
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,148
I'd like to begin by asking you

675
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:10,115
what consumes your thoughts
in your spare time, when you have any?

676
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,071
Well, my thoughts are...

677
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:13,948
What do you do?

678
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:17,076
I'm interested in your face.

679
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:19,955
You're one of the prettiest
interviewers that I've...

680
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,170
Thank you.

681
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,382
You're one of the most gracious hosts
I've ever met.

682
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,376
- Oh really?
- Yes.

683
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:27,549
I hope to see you in Chicago.

684
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:31,219
- We'd like to see you in Chicago.
- We?

685
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:33,429
Is that the collective "we"
or is that the...

686
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:36,019
There are many people
who would like to see you in Chicago.

687
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,605
- But you don't?
- Certainly, I do.

688
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,943
Well, I'm representing WNAC in Boston

689
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:45,734
and our viewing audience
would love to know why you're here

690
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:48,027
and for you to tell us
about your latest movie.

691
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,401
Excuse me,
I didn't mean to touch your ankle.

692
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:56,040
Well, what can I tell you about it?

693
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:58,121
Oh, just some interesting things

694
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,872
that our audience would like to hear...

695
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:03,588
You talk out of the side of your mouth,
did you ever notice that?

696
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:06,174
- No, I...
- You talk... It's charming.

697
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,551
Unintentional.

698
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,634
It's a physical idiosyncrasy,
but it's a charming one.

699
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:14,846
We can't see your right eye.

700
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:17,516
Talking from the side of my mouth?

701
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:18,933
Wouldn't want to do that.

702
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:24,774
Would you like to tell us about behind
the scenes while making the picture?

703
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,566
How far behind the scenes?

704
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:34,073
Answer me something, is it true?

705
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:37,994
There are some rumors about you
and Marlon Brando having a romance, huh?

706
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:39,867
Oh no, we're just good friends.

707
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,285
Just good friends?

708
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:44,296
Well, it seems the other night,
you were going into Mr Brando's room

709
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:47,708
and not coming out until early morning.
Is that true?

710
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,593
Well, yes, it's true,

711
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:52,588
but he is a perfect gentleman.

712
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:55,011
He's a perfect gentleman. I see.

713
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:58,011
Is it true there was some love making
going on there?

714
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:01,810
The people in the next room seem to
have heard some thumping about and...

715
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:05,776
and some rattling of the bed itself.

716
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:07,440
Well, I slept with him.

717
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:10,189
You slept with him?
Well, I don't...

718
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:11,532
In the same bed.

719
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:15,152
Well, I don't know if we can
talk about this over the air, I mean...

720
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:17,621
I hope you folks listening in
will not be...

721
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:20,036
Just close your ears.

722
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:25,462
You have what most men want.

723
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,798
You have a lady to fuck,

724
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:31,670
you have a woman who loves you,
you have a...

725
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,515
Guilty, aren't you?

726
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:45,478
I'm not guilty.

727
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:49,942
It's just the... It's the tequila.

728
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:52,156
- It's the what?
- It's the tequila.

729
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,524
I got it.

730
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:59,034
Past a certain point,
the penis has its own agenda.

731
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:01,620
It has nothing to do with you

732
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:05,836
and a lot of your decisions are made
by your penis and not by your brain.

733
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,832
I'd like to show you a wedding picture.

734
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:13,052
A wedding that took place
on October 11th, 1957.

735
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,670
The man is Marlon Brando.

736
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:19,141
The woman? A young Indian actress
and a model, Anna Kashfi.

737
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:23,266
A good con man can fool anybody.

738
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:26,357
And the first person that you fool

739
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:28,313
as a con man is yourself.

740
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,903
She found out about other women
in my life

741
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:37,072
and I had women coming in the door,
going out the window...

742
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:40,947
The beast aspect of my personality
held sway

743
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:46,794
and overtook anything that was
reasonable, rational, moral or decent.

744
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,339
Because if you haven't ever been loved,
or ever known love,

745
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,216
you'll never know where it is.

746
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,586
You don't know what it looks like
or sounds like.

747
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:58,305
You look in the most unlikely places
to find it.

748
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:02,138
Marriage lasted but a few months,

749
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,432
but a child was born out that coupling.

750
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,141
Christian Devi.

751
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:10,233
I can remember the baby breathing...

752
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,817
Little tiny baby like that...

753
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,941
Then listening to the heart.

754
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:22,864
I didn't want my father
to get near Christian.

755
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:28,748
The day he was born, I said it to myself
with tears in my eyes in the hospital,

756
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:31,629
"My father is never going
to come near that child,

757
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:34,592
because of the damage he did to me."

758
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:44,052
Can I move on to your own acting career

759
00:42:44,187 --> 00:42:46,554
and how your moral beliefs
have affected it?

760
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:50,566
For example, we associate you
with roles like <i>On the Waterfront,</i>

761
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:54,061
where you are a man
who is fighting a righteous cause,

762
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:55,278
a sort of underdog,

763
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,489
you've got the whole union machine
against you,

764
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:00,401
and then there's the roles
like the rebel leader in <i>Viva Zapata!</i>

765
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,069
Where you are for the poor.

766
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,953
Do you deliberately choose these roles?

767
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:08,247
Over your career you've deliberately
chosen roles that have

768
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:10,494
gone along with your political beliefs?

769
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,249
Yes, I think so.

770
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:20,971
On December 23rd, 1787,

771
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:23,512
His Majesty's ship, Bounty,
sailed from England

772
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:25,350
bound for the South Seas,

773
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:27,891
culminating in the most famous mutiny
in history.

774
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,979
You can put it in one word. Fear.

775
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,974
Fear of punishment so vivid in his mind

776
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,897
that he fears it even more
than certain death.

777
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:36,190
In my years of service,
I have never met an officer

778
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:39,861
who inflicted punishment upon men
with such incredible relish.

779
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:42,530
It's sickening.

780
00:43:43,538 --> 00:43:47,407
Then go and be sick in your cabin,
Mr Christian.

781
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:48,953
Human hatred.

782
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:50,326
What is the answer?

783
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:53,044
Is there any answer to injustice?

784
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:56,711
I wanted to make pictures
that are meaningful to me.

785
00:43:56,843 --> 00:43:59,051
You'd best join my war, Mr Christian,

786
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:00,760
for if I don't start winning soon,

787
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:02,880
the casualty list will be real enough.

788
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:07,551
You bring part of yourself
to every character,

789
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:11,392
but some parts
are closer to us than others.

790
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:18,984
Is the story true about
you going to school in Minneapolis?

791
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:22,324
I went to a military academy called...

792
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:26,119
Well, I won't tell you the name.

793
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:27,488
I had a terrible time there.

794
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:33,331
My father sent me
to military school, away from home,

795
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:36,546
the one he had attended.

796
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:39,883
It was a cruel and unusual punishment.

797
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:45,176
The mind of the military has one aim:

798
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:48,884
To be as mechanical as possible.

799
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:52,722
To function like a human machine.

800
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:57,893
Individuality simply did not exist.

801
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:02,197
I had a lot of loneliness.

802
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:07,745
I spent most of the time
up in the library

803
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:12,617
reading the <i>National Geographic</i>
magazine about Tahiti.

804
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:17,588
I was entranced
by the expressions on their faces.

805
00:45:17,757 --> 00:45:20,170
They had unmanaged faces,

806
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:22,543
no manicured expressions.

807
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,927
A kindness.

808
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:27,509
That's where I want to go,

809
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:29,224
that's where I want to be.

810
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:41,445
When I made <i>Mutiny on the Bounty,</i>

811
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:44,815
finally I got a chance to go to Tahiti.

812
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,082
I'd fallen in love with Tahiti.

813
00:45:58,214 --> 00:46:00,080
It was everything I longed for,

814
00:46:00,216 --> 00:46:02,333
everything I hoped it would be.

815
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:08,471
As soon as they'd say cut,

816
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:11,137
I'd take off my jacket,
dive into the water

817
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:14,888
and swim under the boats
and play on the beach.

818
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:20,942
The sky... I've never see a sky like it.

819
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:24,859
And the sunsets defy words.

820
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:27,108
My God.

821
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,077
I've only been here a short time.

822
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:33,572
I have been puzzled
every time I see Tahitians,

823
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:36,621
because I can't figure out
what they're thinking.

824
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:40,162
When you watch Tahitians,
it's like watching a wave,

825
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:43,587
or the wind in the palm tree,
or the palm tree itself.

826
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:47,135
They'll bring their drums
and their skirts,

827
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:48,470
and they'll laugh and dance

828
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,551
and drink and make love.

829
00:46:50,725 --> 00:46:52,432
Full of laughter.

830
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:57,304
Mr Christian.

831
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,733
Kindly satisfy your lust elsewhere.

832
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:05,653
Quite actually, sir,
we were simply discussing...

833
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:06,904
Acknowledge the order.

834
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:11,693
Lust to be satisfied elsewhere, sir.

835
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,407
Report on board immediately.

836
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:19,493
You bloody fool.

837
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:25,124
<i>Mutiny on the Bounty</i>
was perhaps my very worst experience

838
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:27,216
in making a motion picture.

839
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:31,180
I never want to do that kind of picture
again as long as I live.

840
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:35,137
Nobody was agreed when we went in.

841
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:38,603
We all knew that it was impossible
to shoot that story.

842
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:41,519
It won't work. That will never work.

843
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:45,610
You can't have Christian standing aside
not doing anything.

844
00:47:45,738 --> 00:47:48,446
Keep him alive in the story.

845
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:55,033
I was never consulted
before the writing was done.

846
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:58,032
And I cared a great deal
about this picture.

847
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:02,582
You put your life in the hands
of the director,

848
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,579
because the director can screw you up.

849
00:48:04,757 --> 00:48:07,215
You're going too lightly, Quintal.

850
00:48:07,343 --> 00:48:09,551
Lay on with a will
or you'll take his place.

851
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,587
They can't direct actors,

852
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:15,466
they don't know what the process is.

853
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:21,188
How delicate it is
to create an emotional impression.

854
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:25,980
They cover up their sense of inadequacy
by being very authoritative,

855
00:48:26,112 --> 00:48:28,354
commanding things.

856
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:31,948
Didn't he say he wanted
to talk to you and explain it to you?

857
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:36,161
He wanted to give me
a long "no", and I favor short "noes".

858
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:37,324
No, I did...

859
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:40,949
You can't argue with somebody
who's made up their mind.

860
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:44,544
Don't ever be intimidated by directors.

861
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:50,671
You bloody bastard.

862
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:52,965
You'll not put your foot on me again.

863
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:56,511
There was a great deal of friction,
confusion and desperation,

864
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:58,429
disappointment and disgust,

865
00:48:58,561 --> 00:48:59,847
there were fist fights.

866
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:02,224
Ship's company!

867
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,268
I'm taking command of this ship.

868
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,517
Mr Friar, I'll have the keys
to the arms chest.

869
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:08,484
You'll give him nothing!

870
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:12,731
Hey! I'm not your fucking stamp licker.

871
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:14,654
You're making a huge error.

872
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:15,992
Don't make it again.

873
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,954
I don't care if it costs me my job.

874
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:22,324
Marlon, talk about rage.

875
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:25,043
Talk about your own rage.

876
00:49:25,171 --> 00:49:29,461
All my life I've questioned
why I should do something.

877
00:49:29,592 --> 00:49:31,333
I had contempt for authority.

878
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:33,085
I would resist it, I would trick it,

879
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:35,712
I would outmaneuver it, I would do anything

880
00:49:35,848 --> 00:49:38,761
rather than be treated like a cipher.

881
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:41,343
Marlon Brando has been the subject

882
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:43,971
of a good deal
of controversial publicity.

883
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:45,813
He's been called a supreme egotist,

884
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,599
uncooperative, temperamental.

885
00:49:47,735 --> 00:49:50,773
I've rarely seen
such a range of vicious critiques.

886
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:55,612
They were blaming me
for all the delays and everything.

887
00:49:55,743 --> 00:49:57,450
They had to blame it on somebody,

888
00:49:57,578 --> 00:49:59,194
so they blamed it on me.

889
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:02,494
Well, everybody has to have
a whipping boy and certainly the studio.

890
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:04,787
They have to find a scapegoat,

891
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:06,455
they have to find somebody.

892
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:09,000
I was the most logical person.

893
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:13,633
The sickening and endless variety
of lies.

894
00:50:13,761 --> 00:50:15,844
They can hit you every day

895
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:18,630
and you have no way of fighting back.

896
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:23,678
I was very convincing
in my pose of indifference.

897
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:27,062
But I was very sensitive

898
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:29,183
and it hurt a lot.

899
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:50,503
There are times when you think,

900
00:50:50,631 --> 00:50:53,123
"What the fuck is all this for?"

901
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:55,421
"Christ, nobody's listening."

902
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:58,466
There's an old adage in Hollywood,

903
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:01,260
they say "If you have a message,
go to Western Union."

904
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,347
I didn't make any great movies.

905
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:06,390
There's no such thing as a great movie.

906
00:51:06,522 --> 00:51:08,434
In the kingdom of the blind,

907
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:10,523
the man with one eye is the king.

908
00:51:11,944 --> 00:51:13,276
There are no artists.

909
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:15,402
We are businessmen, we're merchants.

910
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:17,656
And there is no art.

911
00:51:19,952 --> 00:51:22,660
Agents, lawyers, publicity people...

912
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:25,413
It's all bullshit.

913
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,490
Money, money, money.

914
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:29,834
If you think it's about something else,

915
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:32,500
you're going to be bruised.

916
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:36,420
I do want to ask you one thing
before we run out of time, Marlon.

917
00:51:36,552 --> 00:51:37,963
You've been quoted
in the papers as saying

918
00:51:38,137 --> 00:51:39,548
that you are going to abandon acting.

919
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,171
Are you really going to do that?

920
00:51:41,307 --> 00:51:45,802
I feel that I'd like to pursue some
other interests that I have long had.

921
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:47,518
And within two or three years,

922
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:49,888
I will have come to the end
of my career.

923
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:53,975
We're all gonna talk about civil rights,

924
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:55,901
we're all gonna go on the television

925
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:57,646
and say what we know,

926
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:59,488
because the country is ignorant.

927
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:07,285
I am really moved and motivated

928
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:10,955
by things that occur that are unjust.

929
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:16,590
I've always hated
people trampling on other people.

930
00:52:19,762 --> 00:52:21,048
I was in a quandary,

931
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:23,676
a philosophical quandary,
because I thought

932
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:27,517
if I am not my brother's keeper,
who am I?

933
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:32,857
Where does my life end and my sense
of responsibility for other lives begin?

934
00:52:34,443 --> 00:52:39,279
Black bodies swinging
in the summer breeze,

935
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:42,524
and the smell of burning death.

936
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,276
You could stand so much of it

937
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:45,492
and to see these people

938
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:48,534
being beaten and kicked and spit on.

939
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:51,617
That could've been my son lying there.

940
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:54,995
And I'm going to do as much as I can.

941
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:58,085
I'm going to start right now

942
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:02,298
to inform white people
of what they don't know.

943
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:04,546
The white man can't cool it

944
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:06,799
because he's never dug it.

945
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:08,971
And I am here to try to dig it.

946
00:53:10,396 --> 00:53:12,604
King was in Memphis at the time.

947
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:18,443
He was striking for a small wage
increase for garbage collectors,

948
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:21,901
which was one of the best jobs
a black man could get.

949
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:25,696
But I want you to know tonight

950
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:30,079
that we as a people
will get to the Promised Land.

951
00:53:30,249 --> 00:53:31,740
That speech where he says,

952
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:33,582
"I've been up to the mountain

953
00:53:33,711 --> 00:53:35,623
and I've seen the Promised Land."

954
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:39,668
So I'm happy tonight,
I'm not worried about anything.

955
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,883
I'm not fearing any man.

956
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:45,299
"I don't know
if I'm gonna get there with you,

957
00:53:45,431 --> 00:53:47,423
but I am not afraid tonight."

958
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:52,052
God, I still remember that.

959
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:54,346
Ah, Jesus. That's terrible.

960
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:56,564
He knew he was going to get killed.

961
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:05,569
Have you considered that
you may suffer bodily harm yourself?

962
00:54:11,457 --> 00:54:12,914
Yes.

963
00:54:13,876 --> 00:54:16,118
I'm standing up,
not for the black race,

964
00:54:16,295 --> 00:54:18,287
I'm standing up for the human race.

965
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:21,460
All men are created equal.

966
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:22,708
This is life and death,

967
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:24,004
this is real life.

968
00:54:24,136 --> 00:54:26,844
We're talking about human relations,

969
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:28,679
we're talking about human rights,

970
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:31,766
racial issues and that's why I care.

971
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:49,818
Get any and all reports from the
South Pacific Commission in respect to

972
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:53,822
discovering what plants grow well
on atolls.

973
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:56,825
How to grow more vegetables
than you can imagine.

974
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,327
And whatever there is on wind power.

975
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:02,627
We'll get the full library
of information

976
00:55:02,758 --> 00:55:04,294
from the South Pacific Commission.

977
00:55:11,225 --> 00:55:13,308
It was after <i>Mutiny on the Bounty.</i>

978
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:16,428
I was up in the mountains on Tahiti.

979
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:19,306
And this guy said, "Do you see
that little island out there?"

980
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:21,182
And I said, "No, I can't see it."

981
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,442
He says, "Can't you see it?"

982
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,687
"It's called Tetiaroa."

983
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:31,651
I never was in a place that told me

984
00:55:31,787 --> 00:55:34,325
to quit running the way this place does,

985
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:36,448
the way these people do.

986
00:55:43,382 --> 00:55:48,173
If I've come closer to a sense
of peace, it would be there.

987
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:57,390
I didn't think of myself
as an owner of the island,

988
00:55:57,521 --> 00:56:01,014
I just thought that I'd paid
for the privilege of visiting there.

989
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:04,142
I had nothing to give to them.

990
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:06,569
They had everything to give to me.

991
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:11,365
They don't care who you are,

992
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:13,075
they don't care what you do.

993
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:15,411
They don't know
that you're a movie star.

994
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:16,871
They couldn't care less.

995
00:56:16,999 --> 00:56:22,211
You cannot lay dollars down
on the table and buy their soul.

996
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:25,959
Very warm, loving people.

997
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:28,083
They come up and put their arm
around you,

998
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,426
come and kiss you for no reason at all.

999
00:56:30,554 --> 00:56:32,386
They just take love for granted.

1000
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:34,472
Is there any actress

1001
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:37,759
that you've especially enjoyed
working with, and why?

1002
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:42,188
That is funny.

1003
00:56:42,316 --> 00:56:44,148
Don't look at me.

1004
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:50,813
If you took some kid

1005
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:52,440
and you brought him up in Tahiti,

1006
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:54,659
he'd be a completely different kid.

1007
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:59,747
He wouldn't have this cruel, mean
society killing him every day,

1008
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:01,582
killing the life out of him.

1009
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:02,993
All these kids of mine

1010
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:05,211
are filled with love from Tahiti.

1011
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:12,752
Here comes Cheyenne.

1012
00:57:12,888 --> 00:57:16,472
Hi, honey. She's going to give you
a little song here.

1013
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,341
Ready?

1014
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:50,211
Ah, beautiful.
That's my very favorite song.

1015
00:57:50,342 --> 00:57:52,459
I love to hear you sing that.

1016
00:57:56,682 --> 00:58:00,471
Tahitians have the beauty
of sleeping children.

1017
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:02,184
And when they waken,

1018
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:05,931
they will waken into the nightmare

1019
00:58:06,066 --> 00:58:08,308
that the white man lives in,

1020
00:58:08,527 --> 00:58:11,736
the nightmare of the want of things.

1021
00:58:15,534 --> 00:58:17,491
Hello. Don Wagner.

1022
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:20,202
If you're back from vacation,
give me a call.

1023
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:24,206
I want to get a script to Marlon Brando.

1024
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:26,792
United Artists gave me your number.

1025
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:31,373
We're trying to locate you, Marlon,

1026
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:34,133
and I don't know where you are.

1027
00:58:34,261 --> 00:58:36,924
If you get the message,
can you talk to us a little bit?

1028
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:40,681
Hello?

1029
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:44,640
Hello? I can't believe
there isn't somebody there. Hello?

1030
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:45,852
Shit.

1031
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:49,440
I'm interested in making enough money

1032
00:58:49,568 --> 00:58:52,732
so I can say "fuck you" to money,
but that's all.

1033
00:58:55,157 --> 00:58:59,401
Acting afforded me
the opportunity of time.

1034
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:01,656
I didn't have to do anything.

1035
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:03,029
I only had to do it once a year

1036
00:59:03,165 --> 00:59:05,282
for three months at the most.

1037
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:10,294
It became just a way of making a living.

1038
00:59:14,843 --> 00:59:16,960
You're certainly unprincipled.

1039
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:18,927
Lying and cheating
come naturally to you.

1040
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:21,594
You're completely without moral qualms.

1041
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:25,014
Yeah, you see, everybody's got
a good side if you look for it.

1042
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:29,810
Lying for a living,
that's what acting is.

1043
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:34,231
All I've done is just learned
how to be aware of the process.

1044
00:59:35,155 --> 00:59:37,568
All of you are actors.

1045
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:41,443
And good actors,
because you're all liars.

1046
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:44,158
When you're saying something
you don't mean,

1047
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:46,823
or refraining from saying something

1048
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:48,415
that you really do mean,

1049
00:59:48,627 --> 00:59:49,708
that's acting.

1050
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:55,418
Let me give you an example.

1051
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:00,753
You're coming home, four o'clock
in the morning, reeking of whiskey,

1052
01:00:00,889 --> 01:00:04,678
and there she is, waiting at
the top of the stairs, your wife.

1053
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:08,227
You wouldn't believe me, sweetheart.

1054
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:11,059
You wouldn't believe
what happened to me.

1055
01:00:11,191 --> 01:00:13,979
Your mind is going 10,000 mph.

1056
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:15,898
You're lying at the speed of light.

1057
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:17,861
You're lying to save your life.

1058
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:21,608
The last thing in the world
you want her to know is the truth.

1059
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:26,912
You lie for peace,

1060
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,372
you lie for tranquility,

1061
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,957
you lie for love.

1062
01:00:32,546 --> 01:00:34,708
So, we all act.

1063
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,957
Some people get paid for that.

1064
01:00:38,218 --> 01:00:41,211
In my experience, with the camera,

1065
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:44,339
if you're a liar
or you're telling a lie,

1066
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:48,013
you better be able to do it
with consummate skill.

1067
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:49,477
If you're not thinking properly,

1068
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:50,807
if you're not in your part,

1069
01:00:50,939 --> 01:00:53,977
it just shows up and there's nothing
you can do about it.

1070
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:05,569
I was ridiculous in the part
that I played.

1071
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:07,369
Everything went bad.

1072
01:01:08,165 --> 01:01:10,077
Take off those pajamas.

1073
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:11,208
This is silly.

1074
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:13,371
We'll see how silly this is.

1075
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:19,624
What is your name?

1076
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:20,795
Candy.

1077
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:25,509
Probably the worst movie
I ever made in my life was called <i>Candy.</i>

1078
01:01:28,393 --> 01:01:30,976
Oh Jesus, Mother Mary.

1079
01:01:33,857 --> 01:01:35,940
How can you do that to yourself?

1080
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:38,400
Haven't you got any fucking pride left?

1081
01:01:41,156 --> 01:01:42,988
I've lost the audience.

1082
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:47,903
You can see it
when you walk into a restaurant.

1083
01:01:48,038 --> 01:01:50,325
"Are you still making movies?"

1084
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:51,989
If you've made a hit movie,

1085
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:56,165
you get the full 32-teeth display.

1086
01:01:58,006 --> 01:01:59,372
You gotta be somebody.

1087
01:01:59,507 --> 01:02:02,215
If you're not anybody,
you've committed a sin.

1088
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:05,465
And you're on your own.

1089
01:02:05,597 --> 01:02:09,307
You're on a goat trail way up,
and you're alone.

1090
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,737
Hello?

1091
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:26,524
Hello?

1092
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:31,992
Sensitivity is too high.

1093
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:34,581
The sensitivity is too high.

1094
01:02:42,801 --> 01:02:48,047
The neurotic individual's entire
self-esteem shrinks to nothing

1095
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:51,140
if he does not receive admiration.

1096
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:55,765
To be admired and to be respected

1097
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:58,014
is a protection against helplessness

1098
01:02:58,149 --> 01:03:00,391
and against insignificance.

1099
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:06,238
And because
he's continually sensing humiliation,

1100
01:03:06,366 --> 01:03:10,110
it will be difficult for him
to have anyone as a friend.

1101
01:03:14,124 --> 01:03:16,616
I used to think I'd never grow up.

1102
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:20,119
I thought that life would go on forever.

1103
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:23,464
And then I worried,

1104
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:25,253
somewhere in the middle years,

1105
01:03:25,385 --> 01:03:28,549
life is going away and I haven't done
this and I haven't done that.

1106
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,171
I've been denied that experience,

1107
01:03:30,307 --> 01:03:32,970
I've denied myself that experience.

1108
01:03:34,394 --> 01:03:37,683
There was a famous dancer, Ulanova.

1109
01:03:37,856 --> 01:03:41,440
And she asked what would be her dream.

1110
01:03:42,736 --> 01:03:46,571
"If I can dance for one minute,"

1111
01:03:46,698 --> 01:03:48,189
perfectly...

1112
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:52,819
"that is all I would ever ask."

1113
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:16,142
Francis Coppola wanted me
for the part of the The Godfather,

1114
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:18,761
but the studio was fighting it.

1115
01:04:19,606 --> 01:04:23,850
It was demeaning to do a screen test,

1116
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:26,352
but I needed a part at that time.

1117
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:30,440
I wasn't sure
I could play that part either.

1118
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:35,453
I got some cotton and I put some here,

1119
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:37,242
little bit of cotton down there.

1120
01:04:37,374 --> 01:04:39,912
And the first thing you know,

1121
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:41,784
I'm talking like this.

1122
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:44,624
Like I took a shot
in the throat or something.

1123
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:48,798
Mumbled my way through it.

1124
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:54,175
The greatest fear an actor has is fear.

1125
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:55,548
How you're gonna be judged.

1126
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:59,681
I don't wanna get caught trying,

1127
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:02,521
I don't wanna get caught being afraid

1128
01:05:02,649 --> 01:05:04,982
that my story, my pretending,

1129
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:06,817
my lie

1130
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:09,273
is going to be disbelieved.

1131
01:05:09,406 --> 01:05:13,195
That's gonna steal
your performance away.

1132
01:05:15,203 --> 01:05:17,490
You have to look at the cameraman,

1133
01:05:17,622 --> 01:05:19,329
the producer lurking in the corner

1134
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:24,373
and say,
"I don't give a fuck about any of you."

1135
01:05:24,504 --> 01:05:27,542
And if by chance an honest man
like yourself should make enemies,

1136
01:05:27,674 --> 01:05:29,791
then they would become my enemies.

1137
01:05:32,429 --> 01:05:34,216
And then they will fear you.

1138
01:05:35,974 --> 01:05:40,184
Putting on a mask,
building a life...

1139
01:05:40,311 --> 01:05:42,553
Little by little I got into this part.

1140
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:46,223
And then suddenly,

1141
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:48,351
something gets a hold of you.

1142
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:51,479
What is the nature of criminality?

1143
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:53,150
Where does it come from?

1144
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:01,280
We have this antiquated belief

1145
01:06:01,416 --> 01:06:04,250
in the myth of goodness and evil.

1146
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:06,790
I don't believe in either one of those.

1147
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:10,835
And I thought it would be interesting
to play a gangster,

1148
01:06:11,009 --> 01:06:12,671
not from the point of view

1149
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:14,384
that he was the bad guy,

1150
01:06:14,512 --> 01:06:16,674
but that he was very gentle.

1151
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:18,805
A hero.

1152
01:06:20,101 --> 01:06:22,684
It is not hard to do the big things.

1153
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:24,394
You can act like a man...

1154
01:06:24,522 --> 01:06:25,763
To scream and yell,

1155
01:06:25,899 --> 01:06:30,109
to get mad and to let somebody have it
right in the mouth.

1156
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:33,650
It's much harder to do nothing.

1157
01:06:33,781 --> 01:06:36,865
They shot Sonny on the causeway.

1158
01:06:37,035 --> 01:06:38,367
He's dead.

1159
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:47,035
Just to sit there and think is a lot.

1160
01:06:51,758 --> 01:06:54,216
I want all inquiries made.

1161
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:56,631
I want no acts of vengeance.

1162
01:06:57,931 --> 01:07:00,093
This war stops now.

1163
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:04,677
Shakespeare addressing all artists.

1164
01:07:04,812 --> 01:07:07,020
Suit the action to the word

1165
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:08,935
and the word to the action.

1166
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:12,442
To hold the mirror up to nature,

1167
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:16,029
to show virtue her own feature,

1168
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:18,023
scorn her own image

1169
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:21,402
and the very age and body of the time

1170
01:07:22,121 --> 01:07:23,407
its form and pressure.

1171
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:25,497
There wasn't enough time, Michael.

1172
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:27,241
There wasn't enough time.

1173
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:28,784
We'll get there, Pop.

1174
01:07:29,754 --> 01:07:31,620
Everything that we do

1175
01:07:31,756 --> 01:07:35,340
should reflect the atmosphere
of our lives.

1176
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:40,429
We're living now
in this mad, crazy, murderous world.

1177
01:07:44,435 --> 01:07:47,928
If I were brought up in that society,

1178
01:07:49,148 --> 01:07:50,514
I'd be like them.

1179
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:53,442
Under certain circumstances,

1180
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:55,778
you could do the same thing.

1181
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:01,450
If anybody would ever try
to take advantage of my children,

1182
01:08:01,578 --> 01:08:03,820
hurting somebody that I love,

1183
01:08:03,955 --> 01:08:05,287
I'd fight for them,

1184
01:08:05,415 --> 01:08:06,906
I would kill them.

1185
01:08:13,423 --> 01:08:16,336
Hi, Dad,
I hope you're feeling fine and, uh...

1186
01:08:16,467 --> 01:08:17,467
I don't know.

1187
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:20,132
I'm just here. I'm working really hard.

1188
01:08:20,263 --> 01:08:23,097
When you come down, I was wondering
if you would send my schoolbooks,

1189
01:08:23,224 --> 01:08:26,934
'cause I'm kinda getting behind
on my schoolwork and... You know?

1190
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:29,595
Well, I'll see you whenever
you come, if you come.

1191
01:08:37,488 --> 01:08:40,606
Marlon Brando's son
Christian has been kidnapped.

1192
01:08:40,742 --> 01:08:43,234
Police initially suspected
mafia involvement

1193
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:46,703
following Brando's portrayal
of godfather Vito Corleone.

1194
01:08:46,831 --> 01:08:49,039
Marlon Brando told me,

1195
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:50,870
"Mr Armes, we want him found,"

1196
01:08:51,002 --> 01:08:53,665
we want him brought back
to Los Angeles,

1197
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:55,454
"no matter what it takes."

1198
01:08:57,008 --> 01:08:59,591
Armes flew into Mexico in a helicopter

1199
01:08:59,719 --> 01:09:02,132
and recovered the 13-year-old boy.

1200
01:09:02,305 --> 01:09:05,218
Christian was found
with a bunch of hippie characters.

1201
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:09,681
He had a terrible case of bronchial
pneumonia and he could barely speak.

1202
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:12,475
Why did they say they had him there
in the first place?

1203
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:15,107
They stated they had the boy there

1204
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:18,147
because Anna,
being the mother of the boy,

1205
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:21,238
promised them 10,000 dollars

1206
01:09:21,366 --> 01:09:23,653
to hide him out from Marlon Brando.

1207
01:09:23,785 --> 01:09:27,028
Christian Brando was
the source of a lengthy custody battle.

1208
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:28,862
A history which saw Christian

1209
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:30,455
used as a pawn in a bitter divorce

1210
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:32,791
and a string
of scandalous public headlines.

1211
01:09:32,919 --> 01:09:35,411
I just happen to be his mother.

1212
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:38,877
You are not anybody, is that clear?

1213
01:09:40,677 --> 01:09:43,465
When it comes to my son
and my children,

1214
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:46,430
you're speaking to someone
that has a different impulse.

1215
01:09:46,557 --> 01:09:48,844
For the very private Marlon Brando,

1216
01:09:48,976 --> 01:09:52,469
the public spotlight
was once again painfully bright.

1217
01:10:04,117 --> 01:10:06,860
This is the to-do list.

1218
01:10:06,994 --> 01:10:09,828
Check Christian's house

1219
01:10:09,997 --> 01:10:11,909
and get the door fixed.

1220
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:15,459
Change the locks.

1221
01:10:15,586 --> 01:10:17,498
Make them larger.

1222
01:10:19,006 --> 01:10:20,918
Install camera

1223
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:25,878
at the gate with radio transmission

1224
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:27,379
at both gates.

1225
01:10:28,349 --> 01:10:32,514
Put lights on so we can see at night

1226
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:34,602
who the fuck it is out there.

1227
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:49,864
I'm not going to lay myself
at the feet of the American public

1228
01:10:49,996 --> 01:10:52,989
and invite them into my soul.

1229
01:10:53,124 --> 01:10:54,786
My soul is a private place.

1230
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:12,637
If they think I'm going to bare my soul
for the next movie,

1231
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:15,261
they're gonna choke
on their shrimp salad.

1232
01:11:15,396 --> 01:11:17,183
I don't know what to call you.

1233
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:19,723
I don't have a name.

1234
01:11:19,859 --> 01:11:23,819
- You want to know my name?
- No, I don't want to know your name.

1235
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:26,150
You don't have a name
and I don't have a name either.

1236
01:11:26,324 --> 01:11:28,782
No names here. Not one name.

1237
01:11:30,912 --> 01:11:34,781
I was curious
about the person in front of me,

1238
01:11:34,916 --> 01:11:37,784
and the person in front of me
was Brando.

1239
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:42,379
Bertolucci wanted to get a perfect

1240
01:11:42,507 --> 01:11:45,250
autobiographical sketch of myself

1241
01:11:45,384 --> 01:11:46,795
in this film.

1242
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:50,679
He wanted me to be me.

1243
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:54,551
I want the person I see
when I go to have dinner with him,

1244
01:11:54,685 --> 01:11:57,302
when we talk and quarrel and discuss.

1245
01:11:57,939 --> 01:12:00,682
And I thought,
"I'm not going to do that."

1246
01:12:00,817 --> 01:12:02,649
"I'm not going to do that for you."

1247
01:12:02,777 --> 01:12:04,609
"What the fuck do you think I am?"

1248
01:12:05,822 --> 01:12:09,236
He was obsessed by privacy.

1249
01:12:09,408 --> 01:12:13,618
He never wanted anybody
to go deep inside him.

1250
01:12:15,957 --> 01:12:18,950
Smart con people find out

1251
01:12:19,085 --> 01:12:21,873
where you want to go emotionally.

1252
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:23,961
They find out what your direction is

1253
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:26,332
and then they help you along with that,

1254
01:12:26,467 --> 01:12:28,049
reinforcing it,

1255
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:31,215
guiding it to their own sweet ends.

1256
01:12:33,432 --> 01:12:36,721
Marlon, there is nothing to fear.

1257
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:40,142
It's very important
to trust in this process.

1258
01:12:41,065 --> 01:12:45,105
Marlon, say something about your past.

1259
01:12:45,236 --> 01:12:47,944
Show in my film what you really are.

1260
01:12:50,575 --> 01:12:53,864
My father was a drunk.

1261
01:12:56,122 --> 01:12:57,579
Tough.

1262
01:12:57,707 --> 01:13:01,291
Whore-fucker, bar fighter,
super masculine.

1263
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:05,708
And it was tough.

1264
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,706
My mother was very...

1265
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:11,631
very poetic.

1266
01:13:11,762 --> 01:13:13,674
But also a drunk.

1267
01:13:13,806 --> 01:13:16,890
Go deeper and deeper...

1268
01:13:17,894 --> 01:13:20,637
Every time more and more real.

1269
01:13:23,691 --> 01:13:27,480
Marlon was invading
the character of Paul.

1270
01:13:31,282 --> 01:13:33,569
You lied to me and I trusted you.

1271
01:13:33,701 --> 01:13:35,658
You lied and you knew you were lying.

1272
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:38,199
Go on, tell me something sweet.

1273
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:42,041
Smile at me and say...
I just misunderstood.

1274
01:13:43,586 --> 01:13:45,202
Go on, tell me.

1275
01:13:45,922 --> 01:13:49,086
Maybe you're desperate for love,

1276
01:13:49,216 --> 01:13:51,253
always have been in your life.

1277
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:54,511
But you've been distrustful of people.

1278
01:13:54,639 --> 01:13:56,801
Is there anything about them
that scares us,

1279
01:13:56,933 --> 01:13:59,971
that's dangerous, that's gonna hurt us?

1280
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:03,140
'Cause a lot of people
are frightened to death of love.

1281
01:14:10,613 --> 01:14:12,605
Fucking God!

1282
01:14:17,536 --> 01:14:21,496
<i>Last Tango in Paris</i>
was a very hard film for me.

1283
01:14:22,333 --> 01:14:26,373
I realized,
"You know you're naked, Marlon."

1284
01:14:29,966 --> 01:14:32,629
When he saw the movie,
he was shocked.

1285
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:35,544
He felt betrayed by me,

1286
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:40,892
because I stole from him
so many sincere things.

1287
01:14:42,395 --> 01:14:43,852
After his comeback

1288
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:47,018
as the ageing romantic hero
of <i>Last Tango in Paris,</i>

1289
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:48,731
and as the Godfather,

1290
01:14:48,859 --> 01:14:51,146
Marlon Brando is once again
the brightest

1291
01:14:51,278 --> 01:14:54,112
and most bankable of Hollywood stars.

1292
01:15:04,417 --> 01:15:07,831
Live, the Academy Awards presentation.

1293
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:11,921
The winner is...

1294
01:15:16,387 --> 01:15:18,720
Marlon Brando in <i>The Godfather.</i>

1295
01:15:23,019 --> 01:15:26,808
Accepting the award
for Marlon Brando in <i>The Godfather,</i>

1296
01:15:26,981 --> 01:15:29,268
Miss Sacheen Littlefeather.

1297
01:15:38,868 --> 01:15:43,203
Hello. I'm representing Marlon Brando
this evening

1298
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:44,946
and he has asked me to tell you

1299
01:15:45,082 --> 01:15:48,666
that he very regretfully cannot accept

1300
01:15:48,794 --> 01:15:51,787
this very generous award.

1301
01:15:51,922 --> 01:15:54,585
And the reasons for this being

1302
01:15:54,717 --> 01:15:57,801
are the treatment
of American Indians today

1303
01:15:57,928 --> 01:16:01,763
by the film industry... excuse me.

1304
01:16:08,439 --> 01:16:12,308
I beg we will meet
with love and generosity.

1305
01:16:12,443 --> 01:16:15,607
Thank you on behalf of Marlon Brando.

1306
01:16:17,782 --> 01:16:19,318
Tell me then, way back,

1307
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:21,783
when you were interested
in the Indians' fishing rights

1308
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:25,370
before it was fashionable to be so,

1309
01:16:25,498 --> 01:16:27,239
what triggered that?

1310
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:31,035
What we have learned about the Indians
has been largely taught to us

1311
01:16:31,170 --> 01:16:34,379
by Hollywood and by motion pictures.

1312
01:16:34,507 --> 01:16:38,501
Seeing Indians represented as savage,

1313
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:41,465
as ugly, as nasty and vicious.

1314
01:16:42,306 --> 01:16:46,095
Everything we are taught about
the American Indian is wrong.

1315
01:16:48,145 --> 01:16:49,977
There have been 400 treaties

1316
01:16:50,106 --> 01:16:53,099
written by the United States
in good faith with the Indians

1317
01:16:53,234 --> 01:16:56,068
and every single one of them was broken.

1318
01:16:56,195 --> 01:16:59,654
We like to see ourselves
as perhaps John Wayne sees us.

1319
01:16:59,824 --> 01:17:03,158
That we are a country
that stands for freedom,

1320
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:05,868
for rightness, for justice.

1321
01:17:06,038 --> 01:17:08,246
It just simply doesn't apply.

1322
01:17:08,374 --> 01:17:11,333
And we were the most rapacious,

1323
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,372
aggressive, destructive,

1324
01:17:13,504 --> 01:17:17,339
torturing, monstrous people,

1325
01:17:17,508 --> 01:17:20,125
who swept from one coast to the other

1326
01:17:20,261 --> 01:17:23,880
murdering and causing mayhem
among the Indians...

1327
01:17:25,516 --> 01:17:27,223
There is one Indian in here.

1328
01:17:34,692 --> 01:17:37,059
But that isn't revealed,

1329
01:17:37,194 --> 01:17:39,402
'cause we don't like
that image of ourselves.

1330
01:17:40,865 --> 01:17:44,449
I don't think the Americans
want to face the truth.

1331
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:47,573
We are all living on stolen land.

1332
01:17:49,748 --> 01:17:53,037
I've seen so many of my friends killed.

1333
01:17:53,169 --> 01:17:55,035
Shot. Stabbed.

1334
01:17:56,297 --> 01:17:57,754
Where do you draw the line?

1335
01:17:57,882 --> 01:17:59,168
At what point do you say,

1336
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:01,633
"God damn it, this is my turf."

1337
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,001
"I was here first."

1338
01:18:03,137 --> 01:18:06,221
"One more step on this land
and you're gonna get it."

1339
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:12,428
I was with Indian armed resistance
in Kenosha, Wisconsin...

1340
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:16,973
insisting a piece of land
belonged to them.

1341
01:18:19,904 --> 01:18:23,568
Then I heard the rifle shot
from the National Guard.

1342
01:18:24,867 --> 01:18:27,200
Bullets started sizzling by me.

1343
01:18:29,622 --> 01:18:32,205
Four feet away from death.

1344
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:36,243
There was an effort
on the part of the government

1345
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:39,371
to cover up the military involvement.

1346
01:18:39,506 --> 01:18:43,250
And any cover-ups
are going to be looked into.

1347
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:48,096
After Watergate and all that corruption
going on, we just can't afford it.

1348
01:18:48,974 --> 01:18:50,806
Are most Indian phones tapped?

1349
01:18:50,935 --> 01:18:52,096
Of course.

1350
01:18:52,228 --> 01:18:54,094
- Is yours?
- Of course.

1351
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:55,641
Do you think that you

1352
01:18:55,814 --> 01:18:58,272
are considered a dangerous person
to the FBI?

1353
01:18:59,235 --> 01:19:01,022
I'm putting myself on the line

1354
01:19:01,153 --> 01:19:03,440
and I have to make it my business
to find out,

1355
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:06,815
and all these bones
are gonna come out of the graves.

1356
01:19:07,868 --> 01:19:09,655
So they lie.

1357
01:19:09,828 --> 01:19:14,664
Congressmen, presidents, all of them.

1358
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:17,663
They lie when they're alone,

1359
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:20,253
they lie when they're asleep.

1360
01:19:20,965 --> 01:19:24,959
They never see faces
without lies anymore,

1361
01:19:25,094 --> 01:19:26,926
except the dead ones.

1362
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:30,138
They're the true assassins,

1363
01:19:30,266 --> 01:19:32,053
the true murderers.

1364
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:36,390
Are you an assassin?

1365
01:19:37,273 --> 01:19:38,639
I'm a soldier.

1366
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:43,317
You're neither.

1367
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:47,188
You're an errand boy.

1368
01:19:48,409 --> 01:19:50,901
Sent by grocery clerks.

1369
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:56,031
To collect a bill.

1370
01:19:58,335 --> 01:19:59,701
These are random notes

1371
01:19:59,878 --> 01:20:04,213
on the subject
of the picture <i>Apocalypse Now.</i>

1372
01:20:04,341 --> 01:20:08,051
Find out the details
of actual special forces operations

1373
01:20:08,178 --> 01:20:09,840
in the jungle of this kind.

1374
01:20:09,972 --> 01:20:13,215
I want to get
as many reports as possible.

1375
01:20:14,268 --> 01:20:17,306
Check the gruesome pictures
in <i>Life</i> magazine.

1376
01:20:17,438 --> 01:20:20,351
Also the pictures
that Larry Burrows took.

1377
01:20:22,443 --> 01:20:25,026
People talk about how proud they are

1378
01:20:25,195 --> 01:20:27,687
of their son who died in Vietnam,

1379
01:20:27,865 --> 01:20:29,982
fighting for his country.

1380
01:20:31,118 --> 01:20:34,532
They had parents so hogwashed

1381
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:37,451
that rather than alter
their belief system,

1382
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:39,324
would kill their children.

1383
01:20:40,336 --> 01:20:44,080
Conviction of the myth is everything.

1384
01:20:44,214 --> 01:20:46,171
We need myths,

1385
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:48,007
we live by myths,

1386
01:20:48,177 --> 01:20:50,089
we die for myths.

1387
01:20:53,474 --> 01:20:56,683
I read the script and it was stupid.

1388
01:20:56,852 --> 01:20:58,388
It was awful.

1389
01:20:59,605 --> 01:21:04,270
I told Francis, "You are making
an enormous error."

1390
01:21:04,401 --> 01:21:08,361
"This guy, Kurtz, don't misuse him."

1391
01:21:09,323 --> 01:21:11,861
I rewrote the entire script.

1392
01:21:13,243 --> 01:21:14,905
And I have it all on tape.

1393
01:21:15,037 --> 01:21:16,619
I have a tape of everything.

1394
01:21:17,623 --> 01:21:18,909
Here is a story note.

1395
01:21:19,041 --> 01:21:21,829
The guy has to be intelligent.

1396
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:23,667
He is without mercy,

1397
01:21:23,796 --> 01:21:25,879
not because he's a merciless man,

1398
01:21:26,006 --> 01:21:28,749
but simply because
that's the logic of it.

1399
01:21:28,926 --> 01:21:30,337
If you're gonna have a war,

1400
01:21:30,469 --> 01:21:33,678
you get all in or all out.

1401
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:38,429
To kill without feeling,

1402
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,892
without passion...

1403
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:44,231
without judgment, without judgment...

1404
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:49,353
I told Francis how I wanted to be lit.

1405
01:21:49,488 --> 01:21:51,730
Half shadow and half light.

1406
01:21:52,783 --> 01:21:54,945
He should be mysterious,

1407
01:21:55,077 --> 01:21:56,818
a mythological figure.

1408
01:21:57,037 --> 01:21:59,996
He is the heart of darkness.

1409
01:22:00,165 --> 01:22:03,533
Horror has a face,

1410
01:22:03,669 --> 01:22:05,501
and you must make a friend of horror.

1411
01:22:06,839 --> 01:22:10,628
Horror and moral terror

1412
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:12,091
are your friends.

1413
01:22:14,471 --> 01:22:17,805
And I felt myself coming apart,

1414
01:22:17,975 --> 01:22:20,433
splitting in two, and it scared me.

1415
01:22:23,272 --> 01:22:25,480
And yet I've gone so far.

1416
01:22:27,192 --> 01:22:29,434
I don't think...

1417
01:22:31,071 --> 01:22:33,154
that I can ever return.

1418
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:35,940
And then I said to myself,

1419
01:22:36,076 --> 01:22:37,612
why are you so frightened?

1420
01:22:37,744 --> 01:22:40,327
Let the fear take you.

1421
01:22:40,456 --> 01:22:42,038
The horror.

1422
01:22:42,166 --> 01:22:44,954
And go with the fear.

1423
01:22:47,671 --> 01:22:49,378
The horror.

1424
01:22:52,092 --> 01:22:54,675
My film is not about Vietnam.

1425
01:22:56,638 --> 01:22:58,755
It is Vietnam.

1426
01:22:58,891 --> 01:23:00,257
It was crazy.

1427
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:02,304
Director Francis Ford Coppola

1428
01:23:02,436 --> 01:23:05,019
had to contend with shooting
in the Philippine jungle,

1429
01:23:05,147 --> 01:23:08,140
a raging civil war and Marlon Brando.

1430
01:23:08,275 --> 01:23:11,188
Coppola was appalled
when Brando arrived grossly overweight

1431
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:12,811
and had to be filmed in shadowy light.

1432
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:15,150
He was already heavy when I hired him.

1433
01:23:15,282 --> 01:23:17,569
But he was so fat,
he was very, very shy about it.

1434
01:23:17,701 --> 01:23:20,284
But that was the least
of the director's problems.

1435
01:23:20,454 --> 01:23:22,366
Pulling his notorious delaying tactics,

1436
01:23:22,498 --> 01:23:23,989
Brando was up to his old tricks again

1437
01:23:24,124 --> 01:23:25,706
with endless script conferences,

1438
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:28,417
costing the production
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

1439
01:23:28,545 --> 01:23:32,414
Clearly he had just
kind of left me in a tough spot.

1440
01:23:32,549 --> 01:23:35,007
Francis Coppola, he's a prick,

1441
01:23:35,135 --> 01:23:36,671
a card-carrying prick.

1442
01:23:36,803 --> 01:23:38,339
I mean the cocksucker.

1443
01:23:38,472 --> 01:23:40,179
How could he do that to me?

1444
01:23:40,307 --> 01:23:41,548
I saved his fucking ass

1445
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:43,891
and he shows his appreciation

1446
01:23:44,061 --> 01:23:46,895
by dumping on me.

1447
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:50,773
Let the tension flow out of you.

1448
01:23:50,901 --> 01:23:52,688
Let it flow out of your mind.

1449
01:23:52,819 --> 01:23:54,731
Five, four...

1450
01:23:54,863 --> 01:23:57,446
Going down in an airplane.

1451
01:23:57,574 --> 01:23:59,736
Softly coming in.

1452
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:02,235
One, zero.

1453
01:24:04,164 --> 01:24:06,577
You hear the Tahitians singing.

1454
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:08,825
Far, distant laughter.

1455
01:24:10,128 --> 01:24:13,041
And it's just after the sun
has gone down.

1456
01:24:13,173 --> 01:24:14,835
A star comes.

1457
01:24:14,967 --> 01:24:16,799
The first star of the evening.

1458
01:24:16,927 --> 01:24:19,135
Peace and love.

1459
01:24:22,599 --> 01:24:24,261
And I'm looking

1460
01:24:24,393 --> 01:24:27,431
at this very deep, indescribable night.

1461
01:24:27,563 --> 01:24:30,476
I think, "God, I've no importance."

1462
01:24:30,607 --> 01:24:32,223
"Whatever I do or don't do,"

1463
01:24:32,401 --> 01:24:33,562
or what anybody does

1464
01:24:33,694 --> 01:24:37,563
"is no more important than
the grains of sand that I'm lying on."

1465
01:24:42,786 --> 01:24:45,494
I've had 110 fights.

1466
01:24:46,582 --> 01:24:48,073
Lost twelve.

1467
01:24:49,585 --> 01:24:51,201
I'm really...

1468
01:24:51,336 --> 01:24:53,794
I've taken too many fucking punches.

1469
01:24:53,922 --> 01:24:56,209
I don't want to be stressed anymore.

1470
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:06,091
You want me to play this guy?

1471
01:25:06,226 --> 01:25:07,592
I'll play that guy.

1472
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:11,353
I'm just a service person.

1473
01:25:14,151 --> 01:25:16,484
Now, no more bullshit.

1474
01:25:16,612 --> 01:25:19,980
We come to
how are you going to fill up my pockets?

1475
01:25:20,157 --> 01:25:22,274
What are you gonna give me?

1476
01:25:27,873 --> 01:25:31,287
I've made as much as 14 million dollars

1477
01:25:31,418 --> 01:25:34,911
for 12 days' work
on a rather silly movie.

1478
01:25:35,047 --> 01:25:38,461
My friends, you know me to be
neither rash nor impulsive.

1479
01:25:39,259 --> 01:25:42,593
And I tell you that we must evacuate
this planet immediately.

1480
01:25:42,721 --> 01:25:46,556
I used to paste the cue card
on actors' faces.

1481
01:25:46,683 --> 01:25:48,299
It saved me a lot of time.

1482
01:25:48,477 --> 01:25:50,560
And I had things that I'd much rather do

1483
01:25:50,687 --> 01:25:53,225
other than studying the fucking lines.

1484
01:25:54,399 --> 01:25:56,641
I have found this other way to do it.

1485
01:25:56,777 --> 01:25:58,313
I had a pocket recorder

1486
01:25:58,445 --> 01:26:01,984
and I had a thing in my ear,
like a hearing aid.

1487
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:03,693
Let's take a little walk.

1488
01:26:03,825 --> 01:26:06,192
Do you mind if I get on this side?
I got bum ears.

1489
01:26:06,328 --> 01:26:09,537
- Sure.
- My machine is on this side.

1490
01:26:09,665 --> 01:26:12,874
I'd get fed lines,
just a suggestion of a line,

1491
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:16,460
and then I'd take the line and mould it.

1492
01:26:16,630 --> 01:26:18,462
It's effective.

1493
01:26:19,216 --> 01:26:22,926
I was using it in that movie.

1494
01:26:23,053 --> 01:26:25,386
I can't even remember the name of it.

1495
01:26:27,557 --> 01:26:30,800
Your eyes are closing,

1496
01:26:30,936 --> 01:26:33,679
getting heavier and heavier.

1497
01:26:34,022 --> 01:26:37,356
Just think of all the good things
that you like.

1498
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:41,607
Like apple pie and ice cream

1499
01:26:41,738 --> 01:26:43,946
and brownies and milk.

1500
01:26:45,992 --> 01:26:48,905
But you must eat them

1501
01:26:49,037 --> 01:26:51,324
not quite so often.

1502
01:26:51,456 --> 01:26:54,415
Day by day, minute by minute,

1503
01:26:54,543 --> 01:26:58,787
second by second, you will lose fat.

1504
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:07,132
When you get as fat as me,

1505
01:27:07,305 --> 01:27:08,671
you gotta start thinking,

1506
01:27:08,807 --> 01:27:11,174
"Well, what's the matter
with the machine?"

1507
01:27:11,309 --> 01:27:13,517
The machine isn't working right.

1508
01:27:13,645 --> 01:27:15,978
It's something out of balance here.

1509
01:27:17,274 --> 01:27:19,357
Food was always a friend.

1510
01:27:20,944 --> 01:27:22,651
When I was a kid,

1511
01:27:22,779 --> 01:27:24,065
I'd come home from school

1512
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:25,946
and I'd open the icebox

1513
01:27:26,074 --> 01:27:28,737
and there'd be apple pie in there

1514
01:27:28,869 --> 01:27:30,451
and cheese and...

1515
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:32,612
They'd say to me, "Come on, Mar",

1516
01:27:32,748 --> 01:27:34,614
why don't you be a pal and take me out?"

1517
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:36,742
"I'm freezing in here."

1518
01:27:38,128 --> 01:27:39,994
The dishes were in the sink

1519
01:27:40,130 --> 01:27:43,544
and the house was unkempt.

1520
01:27:45,719 --> 01:27:48,678
I had the fear that everybody was dead

1521
01:27:48,805 --> 01:27:50,797
and pretending to be alive.

1522
01:27:54,019 --> 01:27:55,885
One time, my old man

1523
01:27:56,021 --> 01:27:57,853
was punching my mother

1524
01:27:57,981 --> 01:27:59,597
and I went up the stairs

1525
01:27:59,733 --> 01:28:01,019
and I went in the room.

1526
01:28:01,151 --> 01:28:04,144
And I had so much adrenaline,

1527
01:28:04,321 --> 01:28:05,732
and I looked at him

1528
01:28:05,864 --> 01:28:08,857
and I fucking put my eyes
right through him

1529
01:28:08,992 --> 01:28:10,699
and I said, "If you hit her again",

1530
01:28:10,827 --> 01:28:13,069
I am going to kill you."

1531
01:28:17,459 --> 01:28:20,998
Copy. All available
units responding to a shooting.

1532
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:22,870
The son of actor Marlon Brando

1533
01:28:23,006 --> 01:28:24,918
facing murder charges this morning.

1534
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:30,011
32-year-old Christian Brando accused
of shooting his half-sister's boyfriend.

1535
01:28:30,138 --> 01:28:32,630
A young man, Christian Brando.

1536
01:28:32,766 --> 01:28:35,008
His half-sister, Cheyenne Brando.

1537
01:28:35,143 --> 01:28:36,975
And her boyfriend.

1538
01:28:37,103 --> 01:28:39,220
It was a triangle that proved fatal

1539
01:28:39,439 --> 01:28:41,601
and brought tragedy to the home

1540
01:28:41,733 --> 01:28:44,897
of one of the world's most famous stars.

1541
01:28:45,028 --> 01:28:46,644
"I shot him, man."

1542
01:28:46,822 --> 01:28:48,654
"But not on purpose."

1543
01:28:48,824 --> 01:28:50,406
"It was an accident."

1544
01:28:50,534 --> 01:28:52,241
The two men had quarreled

1545
01:28:52,369 --> 01:28:54,452
over Drollet's treatment
of Cheyenne Brando.

1546
01:28:54,579 --> 01:28:58,368
Mistreatment police say allegedly
included physical beating.

1547
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:01,789
"Two guys with a loaded gun, wrestling."

1548
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:04,833
"It goes off and he's dead."

1549
01:29:08,635 --> 01:29:10,877
I saw Dag laying there

1550
01:29:11,847 --> 01:29:14,681
and I breathed into his mouth

1551
01:29:14,808 --> 01:29:16,720
and I called 911.

1552
01:29:18,186 --> 01:29:20,143
Asking leniency for his son,

1553
01:29:20,272 --> 01:29:24,812
Brando said Christian's life had been
filled with struggle and unhappiness,

1554
01:29:24,943 --> 01:29:27,856
traumatized by a bitter divorce.

1555
01:29:27,988 --> 01:29:30,446
I think that
perhaps I failed as a father.

1556
01:29:30,615 --> 01:29:33,699
And certainly there were things
that I could've done differently,

1557
01:29:33,827 --> 01:29:35,489
had I known better at the time.

1558
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:37,452
I am at fault in this.

1559
01:29:37,581 --> 01:29:41,325
And if I could trade places with Dag,
I would.

1560
01:29:41,459 --> 01:29:45,294
The total sentence imposed
is ten years in the state prison.

1561
01:29:46,590 --> 01:29:50,174
Cheyenne Brando is suffering
from mental and physical problems

1562
01:29:50,385 --> 01:29:53,128
and cannot travel here
to testify about what she knows.

1563
01:29:53,263 --> 01:29:55,550
Cheyenne is doing her best...

1564
01:29:59,895 --> 01:30:02,638
Excuse me... sorry.

1565
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:06,524
Another personal tragedy
for actor Marlon Brando.

1566
01:30:06,651 --> 01:30:09,064
His 25-year-old daughter Cheyenne

1567
01:30:09,195 --> 01:30:11,562
has committed suicide at her home
in Tahiti.

1568
01:30:11,698 --> 01:30:14,782
Cheyenne Brando reportedly
had made several suicide attempts

1569
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:17,072
before hanging herself yesterday.

1570
01:30:18,830 --> 01:30:20,196
For Marlon Brando,

1571
01:30:20,332 --> 01:30:24,076
Tahiti will never quite be
the same again.

1572
01:30:39,184 --> 01:30:43,224
When in disgrace
with fortune and men's eyes,

1573
01:30:43,355 --> 01:30:46,063
I all alone beweep my outcast state,

1574
01:30:46,191 --> 01:30:47,807
and trouble deaf heaven

1575
01:30:47,943 --> 01:30:50,276
with my bootless cries,

1576
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:53,779
and look upon myself and curse my fate.

1577
01:31:04,292 --> 01:31:06,909
There are times
when you wake up in the morning

1578
01:31:07,045 --> 01:31:10,664
and you turn over and feel,
"Shit! What a life."

1579
01:31:13,593 --> 01:31:15,334
God, I can't figure it out.

1580
01:31:15,512 --> 01:31:17,128
Why did it have to be this way?

1581
01:31:19,599 --> 01:31:20,965
I've had a hard year.

1582
01:31:22,727 --> 01:31:25,686
Maybe harder
than you could possibly imagine.

1583
01:31:31,903 --> 01:31:35,943
You try to be as strong as you can be,

1584
01:31:36,074 --> 01:31:39,943
but everybody reaches break point
sooner or later.

1585
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:45,573
Pain - I knew I had to deal with it.

1586
01:31:47,002 --> 01:31:53,169
I've spent thousands upon thousands
of dollars on psychoanalysts

1587
01:31:53,299 --> 01:31:56,883
and those guys do absolutely nothing

1588
01:31:57,012 --> 01:32:01,006
but stick pliers and screwdrivers
in your brain.

1589
01:32:03,226 --> 01:32:05,889
Life will have given me the truth

1590
01:32:06,021 --> 01:32:08,183
and taken in exchange

1591
01:32:08,314 --> 01:32:10,226
what's left of my youth.

1592
01:32:12,068 --> 01:32:14,355
It took me a while to realize,

1593
01:32:14,529 --> 01:32:16,816
you gotta be your own analyst.

1594
01:32:18,825 --> 01:32:20,782
Unless we look inwards,

1595
01:32:20,910 --> 01:32:24,950
we will not ever be able
to clearly see outwards.

1596
01:32:26,791 --> 01:32:29,283
Nobody is born evil.

1597
01:32:29,419 --> 01:32:33,459
Most people are simply
getting over bad emotional habits

1598
01:32:33,631 --> 01:32:36,920
established in the first ten years
of their life.

1599
01:32:40,055 --> 01:32:44,390
Christian was burdened
with emotional disorders

1600
01:32:44,601 --> 01:32:47,389
and psychological disarray.

1601
01:32:47,562 --> 01:32:50,054
The kind of trouble that I had in life.

1602
01:32:53,068 --> 01:32:55,606
I never tried to be like my father,

1603
01:32:55,737 --> 01:32:58,480
but one inadvertently takes on

1604
01:32:58,656 --> 01:33:01,569
the characteristics of one's parents.

1605
01:33:03,328 --> 01:33:05,240
When my father died,

1606
01:33:05,413 --> 01:33:07,996
I imagined that he was slump-shouldered,

1607
01:33:08,124 --> 01:33:11,492
walking to the edge of eternity.

1608
01:33:11,711 --> 01:33:13,828
He looked back and said,

1609
01:33:13,963 --> 01:33:15,875
"I did the best I could, kid."

1610
01:33:17,717 --> 01:33:19,458
Finally I forgave my father,

1611
01:33:19,636 --> 01:33:24,256
because I realized
that I was a sinner because of him.

1612
01:33:24,390 --> 01:33:25,631
But he was a sinner,

1613
01:33:25,767 --> 01:33:28,305
because his mother left him
when he was four.

1614
01:33:28,436 --> 01:33:30,052
He didn't have a chance.

1615
01:33:32,774 --> 01:33:35,733
And through introspection

1616
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:38,227
and the examination of my mind,

1617
01:33:38,363 --> 01:33:40,480
I feel as though I'm coming closer

1618
01:33:40,657 --> 01:33:42,523
to the common denominator

1619
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:44,737
of what it means to be human.

1620
01:33:49,499 --> 01:33:52,663
Everybody is capable of hatred,

1621
01:33:52,794 --> 01:33:55,207
everybody is capable of love.

1622
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:58,373
If we stretched ourselves
one way or another,

1623
01:33:58,550 --> 01:34:00,041
we could become murderers

1624
01:34:00,176 --> 01:34:02,088
or we could become saints.

1625
01:34:03,555 --> 01:34:05,547
I've done a lot of meditation.

1626
01:34:05,723 --> 01:34:09,012
The result is that
I have felt much calmer

1627
01:34:09,144 --> 01:34:12,808
and I've had moments
of real tranquility.

1628
01:34:14,149 --> 01:34:18,359
Don't you realize that you're thought of
as the greatest actor ever?

1629
01:34:18,486 --> 01:34:20,694
Tim's the greatest actor ever.

1630
01:34:20,822 --> 01:34:23,940
He pretends he loves me when he wants
something to eat. Get outta here.

1631
01:34:25,368 --> 01:34:29,112
Many times
I remember being down in the dumps

1632
01:34:29,247 --> 01:34:31,034
and then I saw a movie

1633
01:34:31,166 --> 01:34:34,125
that took me away for a few hours

1634
01:34:34,252 --> 01:34:36,744
and I was completely restored.

1635
01:34:38,590 --> 01:34:40,798
And I realized, oddly enough,

1636
01:34:40,925 --> 01:34:43,918
that actors make a contribution
to people's lives,

1637
01:34:44,053 --> 01:34:47,091
giving us a gift that you can't buy.

1638
01:34:48,016 --> 01:34:50,474
Something that they can imbue

1639
01:34:50,685 --> 01:34:52,927
with power and beauty and magnificence.

1640
01:34:53,062 --> 01:34:55,054
Something beyond themselves

1641
01:34:55,190 --> 01:34:56,977
and we do need that.

1642
01:34:58,568 --> 01:35:02,061
Acting is just making stuff up,

1643
01:35:02,197 --> 01:35:03,688
but that's okay.

1644
01:35:03,823 --> 01:35:05,610
Life is a rehearsal,

1645
01:35:05,742 --> 01:35:07,324
life is an improvisation.

1646
01:35:08,786 --> 01:35:12,245
I'm gonna have a special microphone
placed in my coffin,

1647
01:35:12,373 --> 01:35:14,865
so that when I wake up in there,

1648
01:35:15,001 --> 01:35:16,333
six feet under the ground,

1649
01:35:16,461 --> 01:35:19,124
I'm gonna say, "Do it differently."

1650
01:35:23,593 --> 01:35:27,052
Anthony. Come here, come here.

1651
01:35:29,432 --> 01:35:31,173
The death scene.

1652
01:35:31,309 --> 01:35:32,971
That's a tough scene to play.

1653
01:35:34,896 --> 01:35:38,765
You have to make them believe
that you're dying.

1654
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:42,109
I would hope it would be
with one person.

1655
01:35:42,237 --> 01:35:44,103
It would be something simple,

1656
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:46,606
like playing tiddlywinks

1657
01:35:46,783 --> 01:35:50,117
or... I don't know, jackstraws.

1658
01:35:54,332 --> 01:35:56,665
Oh, no!

1659
01:36:01,381 --> 01:36:04,044
Try to think
of the most intimate moment

1660
01:36:04,175 --> 01:36:06,167
that you've ever had in your life.

1661
01:36:07,637 --> 01:36:09,629
Run down in there. Run in there.

1662
01:36:11,099 --> 01:36:12,465
Where are you?

1663
01:36:39,877 --> 01:36:43,621
Marlon. Listen to my voice.

1664
01:36:44,674 --> 01:36:46,791
Just let go.

1665
01:36:47,719 --> 01:36:49,506
Just letting go.

1666
01:36:50,888 --> 01:36:52,379
Drift.

1667
01:36:52,515 --> 01:36:55,428
Drift like a cloud in the sky.

1668
01:36:57,603 --> 01:37:00,641
Drifting into that special state,

1669
01:37:00,815 --> 01:37:02,147
the state of peace

1670
01:37:02,275 --> 01:37:04,938
of the boy that you remember,

1671
01:37:05,069 --> 01:37:07,152
watching the elm leaves come down.

1672
01:37:13,202 --> 01:37:15,660
Don't hang on to thoughts,

1673
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:17,742
don't hang on to anything.

1674
01:37:19,751 --> 01:37:22,038
They're old tapes,

1675
01:37:22,170 --> 01:37:23,877
no longer usable,

1676
01:37:24,047 --> 01:37:25,333
no longer useful.

1677
01:37:26,924 --> 01:37:28,631
Chuck 'em.

1678
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:31,628
Put 'em aside. You don't need 'em.

1679
01:37:33,431 --> 01:37:36,674
You're there, you have arrived.

1680
01:37:39,562 --> 01:37:43,852
Your mind is becoming quieter
and quieter.

1681
01:37:44,859 --> 01:37:48,023
Bliss is coming over you...

1682
01:37:50,406 --> 01:37:51,772
Now.

1683
01:37:53,201 --> 01:37:54,988
Until the next time.

1684
01:37:59,165 --> 01:38:00,952
Sleep.

1685
01:42:41,238 --> 01:42:57,238
