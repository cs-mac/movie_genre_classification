1
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,460
My boy said you could hook me up.

2
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,380
I don't know you.

3
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,562
Come on, bro, I could use
an ounce if you got it.

4
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,300
I don't know
what you're talking about, man.

5
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,620
How about... no the ocean would be nice,

6
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,820
but let's give
the first room a shot. Come on.

7
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,380
Hey, how long you been dyeing your hair?

8
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,860
- Come on.
- Put your arm around her.

9
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,760
Come on, smile Hester, with teeth.

10
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,180
What you doing Saturday?

11
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,250
- Now grab her tit.
- Knock it off.

12
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,180
Shit!

13
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,363
- Damn it!
- Relax, Dane can handle himself.

14
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,084
- Who are these two punks?
- Let's go.

15
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,884
I don't want a 50, I need an ounce.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,923
That's too much, I don't carry that.

17
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,167
What's wrong with you?

18
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,965
- I'm strung out.
- Strung out?

19
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,460
You playing with me?

20
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,927
- 'Cause you smell like a cop.
- Nah, man.

21
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,690
Police, don't move!

22
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,500
Drop the gun, asshole!

23
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,460
- Stop moving, you hear me?
- Get off of me!

24
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,641
- You alright?
- Get off me!

25
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,841
- Yeah.
- Grab his gun!

26
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,300
Got it.

27
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,402
Okay, hey, listen up
buddy, here's the deal,

28
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,180
when a police officer tells you
to stop moving, you stop moving!

29
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,540
- Oh, shit, county police!
- Get down on the ground!

30
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,369
On the ground now!

31
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,124
Put your hands behind your head.

32
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,930
- Dane?
- Yeah?

33
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,380
Hands behind your head!

34
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,963
Oh, boy.

35
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,007
Yeah, shut up. Let's go.

36
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,220
You're cut off, buddy.

37
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,004
Cheers, partner, good work.

38
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,161
Cheers, Dane.

39
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,580
Looks like every politician
in the county's here tonight.

40
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,580
They like cops when we make headlines.

41
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,011
Yeah.

42
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,685
Fan of yours?

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,460
She's just after me
for a ride on my Harley.

44
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,580
Is there any female in the Ocean County PD

45
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,340
who hasn't gotten to ride on your Harley?

46
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,487
Just one.

47
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,201
Hey, Dane.

48
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,931
- Good work.
- Thanks, chief.

49
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,010
You met Bryan Kelder?
He was just elected freeholder.

50
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,884
- Ah, congratulations.
- Thank you.

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,004
The board of freeholders
is proud of our excellent police force.

52
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,580
Well this is my excellent
partner, Laurel Hester.

53
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,980
- How do you do?
- Nice to meet you.

54
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,889
My daughter here wants to be a detective.

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,322
Good for you, it's a good job,
but it's not what you see on TV.

56
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,044
I know.

57
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,806
- It was good to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

58
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,980
That low-life you busted,

59
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,300
you think he might give us a lead
on a double homicide in Brick?

60
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,500
It's possible, he certainly
ran his share of coke through Brick.

61
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,806
Why don't you give us a crack at it?

62
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,810
- We'll tail him.
- It's your case.

63
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,928
To Ocean County's finest!

64
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,086
Get it, Stace, come on.

65
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,130
Come on, Stace!

66
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,740
- Nice serve.
- Oh, oh, whoa.

67
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,683
That's what I'm talking about!

68
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,460
You almost had it, it's okay.

69
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,130
It's okay at least you're trying.

70
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,969
- I haven't played since high school.
- I know.

71
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,620
Alright, chin up, alright come on.
Round 2!

72
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,180
Let's go right here.

73
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,420
Who's the um, the new
girls, the one with the hair.

74
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,300
She can't play for shit.

75
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,880
That's your hole, okay?
Make her eat it, make her eat it.

76
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,969
Go, go, go, go, good!

77
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,005
Shoot!

78
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,289
Whoa, what kind of
bullshit serve was that?

79
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,540
Point time, ladies, point time.

80
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,927
We suck this year.

81
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,860
Well, there goes the princess.

82
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,220
- Hey, it's now or never.
- Shut up. Shut up.

83
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,448
- Hey.
- Hey.

84
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,164
Hey, you leaving?

85
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,802
Oh, yeah, all kinds of work to do,
it's a long drive home.

86
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,740
- Where's that?
- Ocean County, New Jersey.

87
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,900
Damn.

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,480
You drove all the way out here to play
volleyball and you don't even like it?

89
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,900
Every now and then I
think you should go out and...

90
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,810
- Try and meet someone?
- Yeah.

91
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,540
They don't have girls in Jersey?

92
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,369
It's not that.

93
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,210
People know me back home,
it's hard to go out and have privacy.

94
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,364
I should go.

95
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,006
Okay.

96
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,042
Can I have your number?

97
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:19,240
- I don't have any paper.
- Just write it on my arm.

98
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,050
I'm Stacie.

99
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,810
I'll give you my cell.

100
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,660
If I'm working, probably won't answer.

101
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,969
And if anyone asks where we met,

102
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,082
please don't mention it.

103
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,500
Laurel.

104
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,540
You have a lot of rules, Laurel.

105
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,483
Yeah, I've been told that.

106
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,607
- What, what, what?
- Hey!

107
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,660
This still get you going?
Spying on junkies?

108
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,740
Huh?

109
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,763
Come on, he's never gonna
lead us to the shooters.

110
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,809
Maybe his girl will.

111
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,801
Hello?

112
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,940
It's Stacie from volleyball.

113
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,580
Listen, I can't talk right now.

114
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,020
Go right ahead, we're not
doing anything important.

115
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,620
Just your run of the mill
double homicide investigation.

116
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,290
Shut up, I can't hear.

117
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,728
Maybe I should get out of
the car, give you some privacy.

118
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,920
When?

119
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,250
Can I call you later?

120
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,569
Okay, bye.

121
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,291
You got a date?

122
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,540
Yeah, I do.

123
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,484
Something serious?

124
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,047
I'll let you know, I'll call you after.

125
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,780
- Here's a soda and a straw...
- Thanks.

126
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,167
- Let me pay you for that.
- Oh, no.

127
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,203
Thank you.

128
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,164
- You look great.
- You look great.

129
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,924
You know, I'm
significantly older than you.

130
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,807
Yeah?

131
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,820
Do you dance?

132
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,400
Not to this, I hate country music.

133
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,100
- I guess this was a...
- No.

134
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,884
- A Bad idea.
- No, sorry.

135
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,580
That came out wrong, I, you know,

136
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,460
I don't date much so I don't know
how to be smooth or whatever.

137
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,740
You don't, you don't
have to be smooth with me.

138
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,241
But if you're really sorry,

139
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,780
and you want to make it up to me...

140
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,020
Oh, come on.
No, I'll make a fool of myself.

141
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,300
No, you won't, trust me, trust me.

142
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,041
Take my hand, put your
other hand on my shoulder.

143
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,130
Shuffle, step, step.

144
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,280
Shuffle, shuffle, step, step.

145
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,287
I don't like going backwards.

146
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,731
I'll guide you.

147
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,740
You hate giving up control, don't you?

148
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,285
Yeah, I hate it.

149
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,607
We'll have to work on that.

150
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,220
I need a break. You want a beer?

151
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,926
- I'll get you beer.
- Sure, yeah.

152
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,580
Hey! What's the matter?

153
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,490
Oh, it was just hot in there,
I wanted to get some air.

154
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,531
That was weird. What are you,
are you trying to ditch me?

155
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,688
No. Of course not, no.

156
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,844
Want to go look at the water?

157
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,260
Sure.

158
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:14,163
I always... I always feel better if
I can look at the water, day or night.

159
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,900
That's why I live at the
ocean, just to be near it.

160
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,686
- Oh, does this bother you?
- No.

161
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,100
You want a drink.

162
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,260
- Oh, no thanks.
- You don't drink?

163
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,660
Not much, my mother was an alcoholic.

164
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,460
- Was?
- She passed away.

165
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,484
- I really miss her.
- Sorry.

166
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,560
My... my father just died.

167
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,180
I'm sorry about that.

168
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,820
He was cool.

169
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,700
He... taught me how
to take apart an engine,

170
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,966
it was so nice just working, being...

171
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,609
Why'd you stop?

172
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,361
- Suddenly felt stupid.
- You're not stupid. Not at all.

173
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,220
I just meant, that's what
it's supposed to feel like,

174
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,846
you know, with another person.

175
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,887
Trusting that person.

176
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,447
- So hard.
- Yeah.

177
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:32,060
Sorry, I get a few beers in
me I sound pretty ridiculous.

178
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,322
I don't think so.

179
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:54,849
- Hey, what's going on here?
- Yeah, we love us some dykes.

180
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,769
We don't want any trouble, so.

181
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,260
Who gives a fuck what you want?

182
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,340
I want your money.

183
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,601
Hey, get out of here!

184
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,643
- Take it easy.
- Get out!

185
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,485
- Take it easy.
- Go, get out, get out!

186
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,807
Take it easy!

187
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,060
You okay?

188
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,288
- What's going on?
- I'm a police officer.

189
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,020
- You're a cop?
- Detective. I should've told you.

190
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,060
- You always carry a gun?
- Most the time.

191
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,924
On a date!

192
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,522
Sorry.

193
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,009
Sorry.

194
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,806
I think you should come home with me.

195
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,220
Martha Stewart has a new worry,

196
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,180
an assistant to her stock
broker has pleaded guilty

197
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,763
to a charge of keeping quiet
about alleged insider trading...

198
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,727
Laurel...

199
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,140
Laurel, your phone's
ringing, do you want me to,

200
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,446
do you want me to get it?

201
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,241
Hey!

202
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,180
Hester.

203
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,900
Oh, hi, Lindy, I thought
you were the office.

204
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,604
Can I call you back?

205
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,540
Okay.

206
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,180
Never answer my phone, okay?

207
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,580
That could've been my partner or my boss.

208
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,940
Sorry I yelled at you, but it's important.

209
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,362
And I'm over it.

210
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,700
Do you want some coffee or some toast?

211
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,340
What, you're a cop so you
think you can yell at people?

212
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,260
- Is that...
- I have to be careful.

213
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,060
In law enforcement women
don't get important cases,

214
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,100
they don't get promoted.
A gay woman, forget it.

215
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,245
Yeah, well, I have to drive all the way
to Pennsylvania, it's like an hour.

216
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,020
I'm going home.

217
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,485
Okay.

218
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,725
Okay?

219
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,241
That's what you're gonna say, okay?

220
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,529
Got a lot of work to get
through this afternoon, so.

221
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,290
Shit...

222
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,725
- Hey.
- Hey.

223
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,540
Remember how you said that
none of Jeeter's buddies

224
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,140
would help us with that double homicide?

225
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,924
- Yeah.
- Look.

226
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,884
Christie Miller, Jeeter's girl.

227
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,380
- So?
- Same high school as Debbie Cherico.

228
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,562
Signed the year book,
"Best friends forever."

229
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,765
Nice.

230
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,420
Let's find her and bring her in.

231
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,140
She works at that
coffee shop in Beachwood.

232
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,766
- You have been working hard.
- All night long.

233
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,660
I'll make a call.

234
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,731
- I guess I owe you $10.
- No, I think it's 20.

235
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:02,020
- Hey.
- What's up Belkin?

236
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,407
Hey, Belkin, I want those... on my desk.

237
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,809
You were at the club
Saturday night, right?

238
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:16,605
Okay, but, uh, we're good right?

239
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,300
I mean I just made detective
I can't risk anybody...

240
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,688
We're good, Belkin.
You don't have to worry.

241
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,600
Okay.

242
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,164
Hey.

243
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,483
- Hi.
- Hi.

244
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,340
I screwed up.

245
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,540
I had no right to talk
to you the way I did.

246
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,201
I ruined our date and I really
enjoy being with you and...

247
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,243
I'm nervous...

248
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,049
Maybe I am too old for you.

249
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,700
Will you stop saying that?

250
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,770
If anything you're too smart for me.

251
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,100
No way, you're smart,
funny, and you're honest

252
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,762
and... basically, I think you're amazing.

253
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,891
You there?

254
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,561
So you called to say I'm amazing?

255
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,210
Yes.

256
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,009
Can I see you again?

257
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,580
Yeah.

258
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,580
Yeah, you can.

259
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,206
Great. Great.

260
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,780
If you could have anything,
what would it be?

261
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,120
What's your dream?

262
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,090
What do you mean, like, be rich or famous?

263
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,528
No, I mean, your big dream,
dream for your life.

264
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,244
- My big dream's kind of small.
- Oh, yeah?

265
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,371
A woman I love loves me.

266
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,980
A house, a dog.

267
00:20:54,080 --> 00:21:00,087
Mm, me too. House, yard, dog, partner.

268
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,620
What kind of dog?

269
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,260
I don't know maybe one
of those little ones?

270
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,460
You know, that you carry
around with you with long,

271
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,580
white hair, what're they called?

272
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,920
Maltese?

273
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,846
Oh, shit. Shit, no, no!

274
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,300
There is no way!

275
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,880
There's no way I'm
living with a little dog!

276
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,282
- I'm kidding!
- That's a deal breaker!

277
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,611
And the one-two, swung on,
driven deep right center field...

278
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,809
Yeah!

279
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,885
Made you a baseball fan, huh?

280
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,620
Detective Hester.

281
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,620
Christie Miller's manager just called,
she's leaving town, it's now or never.

282
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,060
- I'll be there in half an hour.
- Go to home you idiot!

283
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,571
You having a party?

284
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,451
My sister's over, I'll see you.

285
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,940
I got to go.

286
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,930
- It's Saturday.
- Yeah, something's up.

287
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,448
We're working the right lead.

288
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,642
You want to put money on it?

289
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,524
Give me a minute.

290
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,660
Christie, can I talk to you for a sec?

291
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,300
- What about?
- Your friend, Debbie Cherico.

292
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,050
You're not in trouble, okay?

293
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,460
I just want you to come
down to the station

294
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,449
and talk to me for like 30 minutes.

295
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,490
Christie, stop!

296
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,969
- Come on.
- Stop the car!

297
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,250
Stop! Laurel!

298
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,885
Get away, bitch!

299
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,806
You okay, you hurt?

300
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,580
I'm fine, I'm okay.

301
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,761
Come on, Christie.

302
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,420
Let's stop playing games right now, okay?

303
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,660
You and Debbie were best friends,
went to high school together.

304
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,940
You must've went by Tommy's
place at some point or another.

305
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,580
Now, Tommy was moving dope for these guys.

306
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,887
They were in and out of
his apartment all the time.

307
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,780
You expect me to believe
you never saw him?

308
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,580
I told you, I don't know anything.

309
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,380
I don't believe you!

310
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,244
I don't believe you.

311
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,243
Can I talk to Christie alone?

312
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,924
Sure.

313
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,647
Come on, Belkin, let's let
the ladies chat for a few minutes.

314
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,900
I'm gonna turn this off so it's just us.

315
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,809
What the hell's she doin'?

316
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,250
No one needs to hear.

317
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,683
I know you're scared.

318
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,321
Nothing's gonna happen to you here.

319
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,980
It's my job to protect you.

320
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,287
Right.

321
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,083
I know what it's like to be afraid.
It's not a nice feeling.

322
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,286
You don't know anything about me.

323
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,883
You're 19, right?

324
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,780
When I was... when I was
a few years younger than you,

325
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:21,060
like 16, there was something
in my life that I was,

326
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:25,620
I was really scared of and trying to hide.

327
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,460
And after a while I couldn't
take it anymore and I,

328
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,860
um, I went to my mother and I
told her that I needed help.

329
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:36,220
And I ended up in a
psychiatric institution.

330
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,642
I was so scared I made myself sick,

331
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,849
gave myself a nervous breakdown.

332
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,531
And I thought I'd never survive it.

333
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,060
But I did.

334
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,780
I did survive it.

335
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,060
And I learned that being
afraid and hiding things

336
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,481
is a horrible way to live.

337
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,060
And I don't want that for you.

338
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,500
I want you to help me find
Debbie's killer so I can

339
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,660
protect you from them.

340
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:12,651
'Cause I don't want you to spend
the rest of your life being afraid.

341
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,889
Okay.

342
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,644
Okay.

343
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,248
- Hi.
- Hi.

344
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,644
I hope my directions didn't confuse you.

345
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,566
Get ready, here come the dykes.

346
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,140
The backyard is very private.

347
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,402
Just like you wanted.

348
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,683
And it's a sweet
neighborhood, all families.

349
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,250
Which one of you is Ms. Hester?

350
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,380
- I'm detective Hester.
- And you are a friend?

351
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,340
- Yeah, she's my friend.
- Oh...

352
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,603
Yeah, I'm her friend
who's also gonna live here.

353
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,610
I'll just wait outside.

354
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:54,650
- What a bitch.
- It needs a lot of work.

355
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,484
There's plenty of light!

356
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,020
Need more closet space, though.

357
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,327
The garage is attached!

358
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:08,020
And there's enough room for your car
and my truck, and my dad's Harley.

359
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,124
You can't bring you dad's motorcycle.

360
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,180
- What?
- No, it's too dangerous.

361
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,860
I don't want to worry about
you every time you go out.

362
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,580
But... I'll let you get a dog.

363
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,887
You'll let me, you'll let me?

364
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,931
- You like it?
- Yeah, a lot.

365
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,380
There's no way I can afford this mortgage.

366
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,165
- Not even half.
- Yeah, I'll take out the loan.

367
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:39,604
I mean, I can do the renovation,
I can paint and dry wall.

368
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,260
- You can dry wall?
- Hell yeah.

369
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,283
That's sexy.

370
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,688
- So, we have a house?
- Yeah, we have a house!

371
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,004
You're... the shit at that.

372
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,128
- Thanks, Mom.
- Of course.

373
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,008
You two are a long way from home.

374
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,980
Okay.

375
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,540
Got your three forms of ID,

376
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,700
proof of common assets and common domain,

377
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,610
a shared bank account, a deed.

378
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,180
Give me a second here.

379
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,500
This domestic partnership thing is new.

380
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,260
Take your time.

381
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,820
When people get married

382
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,287
they don't have to go through
this whole ordeal.

383
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,285
Well, that's it.

384
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,089
Thanks.

385
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,020
Happy domestic partnership day.

386
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,281
Thank you.

387
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,290
- I got something for you.
- Yeah?

388
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,171
Looks like the beach.

389
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,900
Thanks. I got something for you too.

390
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,843
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

391
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:13,420
It's a card from the police union,
got your name on it,

392
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,124
it says we're family.

393
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,648
So, if you're stopped
while you're driving,

394
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,860
and let's face it, you do drive fast,

395
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,691
just give this to the officer,
you won't get a ticket.

396
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,130
Family.

397
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,681
Guess that makes it official, huh?

398
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,288
Official, baby.

399
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:55,420
I have a certificate
in computer diagnostics

400
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,684
and I can do engine work
and electrical and...

401
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,207
You're like four feet tall.

402
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,728
How long is your fastest tire rotation?

403
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,180
8 minutes, my guys are good.

404
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,725
Well, I can beat that.

405
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:15,211
Derek's our rotation champ.
You can't beat him.

406
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,725
Do you want to bet?

407
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,322
This is a waste of time.

408
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,485
Go.

409
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,761
Tire weighs as much as you, sweetheart,
sure you can handle it?

410
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,246
- Done!
- Wait, what?

411
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,651
No way.

412
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,940
7 minutes, 12 seconds.
That's gotta be a record.

413
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,451
So I got the job?

414
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,608
Oh, so she can change tires, so what?

415
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,340
We need a real mechanic in here, Jake!

416
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,046
I can do my job, thanks.

417
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,684
See you tomorrow morning at 8 AM.

418
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,564
You better be good!

419
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:55,645
- Congratulations on the job.
- Thanks.

420
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,380
I'm gonna make a contribution
to the mortgage every month.

421
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,460
- You don't have to do that.
- Yeah, I do.

422
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:06,804
I kind of like the idea
of you as a kept woman, it's sexy.

423
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,260
Kind of makes you feel
like you're in charge, huh?

424
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,540
I know I'm not in charge of you,
sweetie, it's impossible.

425
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,246
Doesn't stop you from trying.

426
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,886
- Oh, God.
- What's the matter?

427
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,580
- Oh, I think I pulled a muscle.
- Yeah?

428
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,411
- How long have you had that?
- A couple weeks.

429
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,940
Couple weeks?

430
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,940
- Yeah.
- Will you get it checked out?

431
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,980
Yeah.

432
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,340
- This week?
- Sure.

433
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,260
- Tomorrow?
- I will!

434
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,420
Don't look so worried,
I pulled a muscle on the job,

435
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,522
I'm a cop, that's what happens.

436
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,689
I know, you're a superhero.

437
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,403
Laurel, want to come in?

438
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,890
Hey.

439
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,930
Hey.

440
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:28,660
Can I... can I help you?

441
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:33,340
Yeah, I dropped by to see Laurel.

442
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,220
Laurel Hester, this is her house?

443
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,209
- She here?
- Yeah.

444
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,571
Is that, is that a rowdy?

445
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,763
That's what the fellow
at the nursery told me.

446
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,087
You doing the landscaping?

447
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,803
- Hey.
- Hey!

448
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,820
I dropped by to give you
a housewarming present,

449
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,921
figured it was kind of overdue.

450
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:56,020
Hey, thanks. Did you meet Stacie?

451
00:34:56,120 --> 00:35:00,260
Yeah, he thinks I'm the,
thinks I'm the gardener.

452
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,762
No, oh, Stacie's my roommate.

453
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,700
Oh, great.

454
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,247
Yeah, it's great.

455
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,606
Well, I didn't mean to...

456
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,849
I just wanted to wish you
good luck with the house and...

457
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,420
- Thanks.
- I'll see you Monday.

458
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,860
I'll see you Monday,
thanks for stopping by.

459
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,123
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

460
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,328
Roommates don't sleep in the same bed.

461
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,460
- He's my partner.
- No, I'm your partner.

462
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,340
That is the person you work with.

463
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,851
And he's got a total crush on you.

464
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,531
- No he doesn't.
- Yes, he does.

465
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,010
Hey! Wait a minute!

466
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,620
Sorry, it's a bad cop habit,
showing up unannounced.

467
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,486
Stacie's not my roommate,
she's my girlfriend.

468
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,642
Why the hell didn't you tell me?

469
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,840
Never came up. Never saw
any reason to talk about it.

470
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,403
Remember when I found
out I had a daughter?

471
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,500
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

472
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:16,340
That wasn't my proudest moment,
but I told you about it, you know why?

473
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,011
Because you count on me, right?

474
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,580
Yeah.

475
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,900
When things are happening,
we get in a situation,

476
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,740
people are reaching for their guns,
you need to know what's going on with me.

477
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,780
Am I up, am I down,
am I distracted, in love?

478
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,848
Whatever, your life depends on it!

479
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,980
And all these years you been holding back

480
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,660
this part of yourself because, what?

481
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,460
Because you didn't trust me
enough to say anything.

482
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,300
- Come on! You think I could've...
- Thanks a lot!

483
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,980
I could've been out at
work and gotten anywhere

484
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,923
beyond back office filing reports?

485
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,820
You don't get it,
you know, you're straight,

486
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,700
you're white, you're male, this is not...

487
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,620
- Don't give me that bullshit.
- No, no, it is not bullshit.

488
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,980
Things are handed to you I have to
fight for, that's the way it is!

489
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,140
Oh, boo-hoo. So you're the oppressed
minority now, is that it?

490
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,526
Yeah.

491
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,420
Are the other cops' wives gonna be there?

492
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,340
Yeah, probably.

493
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,220
We, you know, all have to go,
it's the chief's birthday.

494
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,980
Yeah, well, it kind of sucks, doesn't it?

495
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,220
Yeah, it does.

496
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,540
It does suck, but that's how it is right?

497
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,130
You know that.

498
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:35,180
Look, I don't have to go.
I could stay home.

499
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,647
You want me to stay home, babe?

500
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,044
No.

501
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,767
I mean, you want to
make lieutenant, right?

502
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:54,460
- First woman in Ocean County.
- That's the plan.

503
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,660
- Go.
- Okay.

504
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:00,220
This is Laurel Hester,
please leave a message.

505
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,689
Laurel, it's Dr. Tonner, please call me
back as soon as you get this message.

506
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,567
Hello, it's Laurel Hester.

507
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:00,001
I'm waiting for Laurel, it's been hours.

508
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,009
You're waiting for Laurel Hester?

509
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,340
Right.

510
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,300
- You're her sister?
- Partner.

511
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,660
Oh, I was expecting a family member.

512
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,700
She's my partner!

513
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,580
Or my wife, or whatever, and
I know that something's wrong!

514
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,571
Okay, please, calm down, I'm sorry.

515
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,567
The results of the bronchoscopy
are very concerning.

516
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,409
Laurel has 3 masses in her right lung.

517
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,961
Masses...

518
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,500
You mean cancer?

519
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:42,140
It's not definitive until we get
the results back from the lab.

520
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,642
But, yes, it's probably late stage cancer.

521
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:51,249
Now, we do have treatment options...

522
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,129
Where are you going?

523
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,447
They told you everything?

524
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,289
Yeah.

525
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,128
But we're, we're gonna fight this.

526
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:21,020
We're gonna get the best treatment
and I'm gonna take off work

527
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,980
and help you and my mom
can come stay with us.

528
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,540
- Right, but I think that...
- It'll be okay.

529
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,820
We need...

530
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,820
I can't pull up, Christ!

531
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,460
Did the doctor tell you
about the survival rate?

532
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,722
Yeah.

533
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:40,164
Yeah, but, you know,
we're gonna beat this.

534
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,442
We're gonna beat this.

535
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,649
We will.

536
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,810
How you doing?

537
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,327
Okay.

538
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:28,970
You know, start my
treatment next week, so...

539
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,100
- I'm sorry.
- Nah, it's okay.

540
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:46,580
You've seen me playing at compromised
situations drunk off my ass.

541
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:50,620
Listen, I know it's a cliche,
but if there's anything I can do.

542
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,529
Yeah, you know.

543
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:58,085
If something happens,
I want my pension to go to Stacie

544
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,010
'cause it's the only way she
can afford to keep our house.

545
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:04,363
But that's for married people, ain't it?

546
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,644
Thanks for the support.

547
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,410
- Laurel.
- It's alright, man.

548
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:40,020
Sweetie, sweetie?

549
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,202
I don't want you to see this.

550
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,209
Alright, here.

551
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,049
Pass that around.

552
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:07,580
Alright so this is from
Detective Laurel Hester

553
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,580
who's currently on medical
leave of absence because,

554
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,580
unfortunately, she has stage 4 cancer.

555
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:15,580
And she's asking that in
the event of her death,

556
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,220
her pension benefits be assigned
to her partner, Stacie Andree.

557
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,608
- Stacie Andree is a woman, correct?
- Correct.

558
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,220
I'm just trying to wrap my mind
around her being a lesbian.

559
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,446
Why?

560
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,780
Well, she's so not like a lesbian.

561
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,740
The contract we negotiated
with the police union

562
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,410
doesn't give Detective Hester the right

563
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:38,060
to assign her benefits
to her roommate, end of story.

564
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,811
Alright, so motion to deny
Detective Hester's request?

565
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:50,660
Well, actually, the Domestic Partnership
Act passed by the state legislature

566
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,660
extends benefits to same sex
partners of state employees.

567
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,940
Hester's a county employee.

568
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:00,180
But the law says we can
assign benefits to county employees.

569
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,460
Right, and bankrupt the county.

570
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,300
- Come on.
- No, come on, what?

571
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,180
People can make anybody their
partners and get benefits?

572
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,860
It's really very hard
to form a domestic partnership,

573
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,260
actually, harder than marriage.

574
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,567
Nothing's harder than marriage.

575
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,780
Bryan, the law you're
talking about violates

576
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,100
the sanctity of marriage.

577
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:25,411
It offends traditional values, and in
this county, that's political suicide.

578
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,604
She's dying.

579
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:32,500
Yes, and that's a personal tragedy
and we deal in public policy here.

580
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,444
But I move that we deny
Detective Hester's request,

581
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:39,406
we should wish her the best
and tell her she's in our prayers.

582
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,922
- Alright, all in favor?
- Yes.

583
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:48,740
- Brian?
- Oh, abstain.

584
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:52,820
We like our decisions to have
the authority of unanimous vote.

585
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:56,003
It's been our tradition for 150 years.

586
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:04,340
- Yes.
- Good.

587
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:09,380
The technician said that you just suck in

588
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:13,280
and hold the medicine
in your lungs as long as you can.

589
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,925
Okay.

590
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,449
You okay?

591
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:32,340
We're in the middle of treatment, so...

592
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:35,410
Hey! It's okay, come in!

593
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:38,780
That's my sister, Lindy.
Lindy, that's Dane.

594
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,689
Hey.

595
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,740
Well, they turned you down Laurel

596
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,684
and then they buried the decision
in the back of the paper.

597
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,380
Yeah, I saw.

598
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,100
So, I just wanted you to
know I'm not happy about it.

599
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,940
- Yeah, thanks.
- Laurel, treatment.

600
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,644
There's one other thing we could try.

601
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,900
What's that?

602
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,651
These guys are terrified of controversy.

603
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,888
If you go to one of their meetings.

604
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,940
You mean, in person, make a speech?

605
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,724
- Make a request.
- Laurel.

606
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,571
They have a public
meeting every 2 weeks.

607
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,569
In front of everyone?

608
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,100
Yeah, so then everyone knows our business?

609
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,620
I mean, who are these people?

610
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:24,020
They're the local government,
they run Ocean County.

611
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,820
It's gonna be a lot harder
for them to shoot you down

612
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:30,260
if you go in there face to face
and ask for what you got coming to you.

613
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,820
You deserve it.

614
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,140
Laurel, do the treatment,
I gotta go to work!

615
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:34,580
Okay, okay.

616
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:37,729
This whole pension thing
is a waste of time, okay?

617
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,524
She's not gonna need it
'cause she's gonna get better,

618
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:42,041
can you stop bothering
us with this bullshit?

619
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,260
This is so hard for her.

620
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:53,364
Laurel, you gotta go
to one of these meetings.

621
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:55,721
It's the only thing that could work.

622
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,883
My relationship to the patient is partner!

623
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,128
I've been through this with you...

624
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:12,926
This bill from Sloan Kettering for $900.

625
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:37,180
I know that some members
of the public have questioned

626
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,409
the cause for the parking meters,
but after careful review,

627
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:43,260
we think it would be the
best thing for the community.

628
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:46,340
So, motion to approve the new meters.

629
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,060
- So moved.
- How do you vote?

630
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,605
Yes.

631
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:52,121
- You okay?
- Motion's passed.

632
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,766
- Don Bennin is here.
- Hey, sis.

633
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:57,366
- Who's that?
- He's a reporter.

634
00:48:58,320 --> 00:48:59,810
Is he gonna write about this?

635
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,649
Yeah, probably.

636
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,500
Well that takes care of all the

637
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:10,300
items on our agenda and unless
anyone has anymore questions,

638
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,180
we will call this meeting to a close.

639
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,327
Yes?

640
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,740
Good afternoon, freeholders.

641
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:23,140
You have a question
about the parking meters?

642
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:26,801
No, my name is Detective Laurel Hester.

643
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,849
Hopefully you remember me from...

644
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,361
Of course, I'm sorry,
I didn't recognize you, hello.

645
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:37,380
I've worked for the Ocean County
Police Department for 23 years.

646
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:42,486
I'm here today with my
partner, Stacie Andree.

647
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,300
In my career I've been
shot at, dragged by a car,

648
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:52,260
clubbed, beaten, punched, and kicked,

649
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:54,380
but I've always come out on top.

650
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,300
I've never been afraid of
injury or death while performing

651
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:01,100
my duties, that's the job
and I love my job.

652
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:05,620
Recently I was diagnosed
with stage four lung cancer.

653
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:08,690
Although radiation has shrunk the tumors,

654
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,620
my chances for survival
remain less than 10 percent.

655
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:15,780
It's possible I've finally
met an opponent I can't beat.

656
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:19,420
Please reconsider your
decision and grant my request

657
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,580
to assign my pension benefits to Stacie.

658
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:27,580
Making it possible for her to
stay in our home when I'm gone.

659
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:31,620
When my heterosexual colleagues die,
their pensions go to their spouses.

660
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:37,660
But because my partner is a woman,
I don't get to do that.

661
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:43,380
In my 23 years as a police
officer I've never asked

662
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:49,044
for special treatment,
I'm only asking for equality.

663
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:53,561
Thank you.

664
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:59,220
We commend you for your
service to the county,

665
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:02,140
you're a valuable and trusted employee.

666
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,180
- Agreed.
- Thank you.

667
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:07,620
My colleagues and I, we've
anguished over your situation,

668
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:12,100
but benefits for county employees
are part of a negotiated

669
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,620
contractual settlement
and we just can't re-open

670
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:17,700
- negotiation at this time...
- She gave you 23 years of service!

671
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,420
You're out of order, Dane.

672
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:23,126
God bless you, this meeting is adjourned.

673
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,260
Hey.

674
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:41,820
Detective Hester, how about an interview?

675
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,420
- Not today.
- Please leave us alone.

676
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,820
Listen, I'll set up an interview

677
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,460
if you promise to put
her story on the front page.

678
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:51,140
Done. Did you see those guys squirm?

679
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,580
No one ever questions them about anything.

680
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,011
Well, they should.

681
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:58,849
My partner spends her life fighting
for justice, they deny justice to her.

682
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,167
That, that is great.

683
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,700
Dane Wells.

684
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,700
This is Steven Goldstein
from Garden State Equality.

685
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,620
I just wanted to call to tell
you that we are all outraged

686
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,500
about what's happening to Laurel Hester

687
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:32,410
and we would like to help.

688
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:35,251
Okay.

689
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,540
What these freeholders
are doing is unconscionable.

690
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,380
We need to let them know

691
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,566
that either they reverse their decision
or there are going to be consequences.

692
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,682
They've never reversed a decision.

693
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,500
They have never met me before.

694
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:52,683
Their next meeting we show
up with 100 protesters.

695
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,043
Gay cops, gay attorneys,
a priest, a rabbi,

696
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,460
I know a couple gay grandmothers.

697
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:59,460
Maybe we organize a gay pride parade!

698
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:01,460
You mean a bunch of bare
chested men in leather

699
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,050
marching down Main Street?

700
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:06,010
We show them that we are
a force to be reckoned with.

701
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,884
In this county there are

702
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,780
a quarter million senior citizens
registered Republicans.

703
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,260
You're gonna turn them all against Laurel.

704
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:15,740
I appreciate your perspective,
I ran Corzine's senate campaign in 2000,

705
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:16,921
so I know what I'm doing.

706
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,500
Okay, Steve, but I know this community.

707
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:21,300
It's Steven, with a V, as in very gay.

708
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:24,780
And when people disrespect
my gay brothers and sisters,

709
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,884
I rain terror on them!

710
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,925
Shock and awe, shock and awe!

711
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:36,780
Sweetheart, I am going to need you
to be available for interviews.

712
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,245
Lots and lots of interviews.

713
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:39,820
This is gonna be a national news story.

714
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,083
Steven, it seems to me
that you're using my case

715
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:45,700
to promote your cause, gay marriage.

716
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,723
That is exactly what I'm doing.

717
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:50,890
This is the case that I've been waiting
for, that I've been dreaming about.

718
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,500
This is going to put this issue
in the national spotlight,

719
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:56,180
it is going to turn
the tide for gay marriage.

720
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:01,180
My fight is not about
marriage, it's about equality.

721
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,770
It's about a cop getting
the benefits she deserv...

722
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,500
Not about marriage, are you kidding me?

723
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:09,366
I'm sorry. I just,
I'm very passionate about this.

724
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:14,220
If you were married,
and not this bullshit,

725
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,322
second-class citizen
domestic partner crap,

726
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,090
but married, there wouldn't be an issue.

727
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,460
Stacie would be entitled to your benefits.

728
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:23,620
Hell, if you and I got married tomorrow,
I'd be entitled to your benefits.

729
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:27,930
- Is that a proposal?
- Oh, honey, I will marry you.

730
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:30,441
But I wouldn't know what
to do with your vagina.

731
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,860
Oh, my God.

732
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:39,500
I just don't want this whole
political thing to take over our lives.

733
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,340
We need to get you better.

734
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,900
All this hoopla isn't necessary.

735
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,809
All we need are Ocean County voters

736
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,780
at the next freeholder meeting.

737
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,009
Radicals and strangers from New York
aren't gonna convince these guys.

738
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:53,488
I am not a radical,
and I am not from New York.

739
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:56,660
I am a middle-class Jewish
homosexual from New Jersey.

740
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,171
How about you, sweetheart?

741
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:00,500
I'm a straight, white,

742
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:05,260
anglosex and ex-protestant, atheist cop.

743
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:07,500
You okay with that, sweetheart?

744
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:10,444
I am, that is very hot.

745
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,363
It's an opportunity to change the world.

746
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:21,806
Laurel, this can be your legacy.

747
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:29,171
It is not a local story, Mark, it's an
outrageous miscarriage of justice.

748
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:33,041
I'm giving you the opportunity
to cover this nationally.

749
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,540
Yes.

750
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:38,540
Okay, well you know what,
if your editor doesn't see

751
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,291
how important this story is,
then he is an idiot,

752
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,420
or a closeted homophobe.

753
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,682
Yes, you heard me.

754
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,842
We need more Entenmann's!

755
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,162
Hey, you got room, you can pull up.

756
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,090
Why don't you get out of our town!

757
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,043
Just get out of here, you lesbian bitch!

758
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,648
Get the hell out of here, get out!

759
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,962
- Assholes!
- God damn dyke!

760
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:14,689
- You okay?
- Yeah.

761
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:21,009
Hello? What?

762
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,242
I'm coming.

763
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,929
Go!

764
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:31,881
Laurel, Mom, what happened?

765
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,282
All of a sudden she was so confused,
she didn't know where she was and I,

766
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,740
I didn't know what to do.

767
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:38,524
- You're okay.
- She'll gonna be okay.

768
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,180
Patients only!

769
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,682
Laurel, I love you!

770
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,289
I love you!

771
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,650
What's going on?

772
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:07,688
Cancer, um, spread to her brain.

773
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:16,601
And her lymph nodes and the...
side of her neck.

774
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:18,481
Jesus.

775
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,442
The doctor said that...

776
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:29,964
that we're not trying
to cure anything anymore.

777
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:37,447
That we're just trying
to buy a little time.

778
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:40,128
I...

779
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:52,050
I thought we had a few years.

780
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:01,123
I had myself convinced.

781
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,365
Oh, God.

782
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:07,620
So, the meeting's tomorrow?

783
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:09,220
Yeah.

784
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,322
Steven's got all kinds of
big things in the works.

785
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:13,220
Protesters, speeches, who knows,

786
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,060
he might shoot himself out of a cannon.

787
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:18,060
Wrapped in a rainbow flag.

788
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:21,820
Well, if we win, I hope
I'm still around to see it.

789
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:25,740
Hey... Hey, don't talk like that.

790
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:28,060
They're gonna get you all sorted
out with this radiation thing.

791
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:33,003
I have a very sensitive bullshit meter
and it's ringing off the hook right now.

792
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:35,771
I expect the truth from you, partner.

793
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,604
Okay.

794
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,780
I'm worried about Stacie.

795
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:49,700
Yeah, you know, she's trying to accept it.

796
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:53,260
She's had so much to deal with,
you know, she's so young.

797
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,124
It's not fair.

798
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,300
Life's not fair.

799
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,528
No, it isn't.

800
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:08,201
Sorry I never told you
the truth all those years.

801
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:11,900
You know, maybe I wanted
people to think we were

802
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,130
into each other, it was just
easier, you know, for me.

803
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:22,964
Maybe I thought you wouldn't
want to be my friend.

804
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:28,006
I should've known better.

805
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:32,211
I have no regrets.

806
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:40,089
Justice for Laurel!

807
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:47,140
Everyone. Energy, energy!

808
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:50,881
Justice for Laurel, justice for Laurel!

809
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:02,010
Hi, sweetie, are you one of us?

810
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:06,290
- No, I'm not.
- Do you want to be?

811
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:10,620
I can make it happen.

812
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:11,700
Come on, guys.

813
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,220
The more of us show up

814
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:14,620
at this meeting the more

815
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,324
they know the department's behind her.

816
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:19,444
And if they say yes then my tax
dollars go to her girlfriend.

817
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,284
Yeah.

818
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:24,131
Yeah, the same way your wife
gets your pension if you die.

819
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,740
Yeah, but she's my wife!

820
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:29,580
Look, the chief says
it's a political issue

821
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:32,660
and we can't take sides.

822
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:36,287
What's political about a cop
getting screwed out of her pension?

823
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:40,122
Who's coming to the meeting?

824
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:45,420
Oh, don't put yourselves out.

825
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:47,363
She'd back up any of you in a heartbeat!

826
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:49,220
And she's dying!

827
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:52,164
But hey, you know, she's a
dyke so who gives a shit?

828
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:56,647
Cowards.

829
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,900
Well, now we know for sure.
Dane Wells is a fag.

830
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,660
Why don't you just back off?

831
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:07,240
Why don't you just let me know when
you're gonna come out of the closet, Julio?

832
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:12,890
Dane!

833
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:22,687
I just wanted to say that I think
you're doing the right thing.

834
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:25,921
Show up for Laurel.

835
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:29,849
I can't.

836
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:32,620
I'm sorry.

837
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:35,963
We never had this conversation.

838
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:43,260
You have the power!

839
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:46,780
- You can do this.
- It's not in our hands.

840
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,060
It is in your hands!

841
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,300
You have the power!

842
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,210
Ladies and gentlemen. Please sit down.

843
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:55,209
Please.

844
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:56,606
You can do this! You can do this!

845
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,531
This all came out in
the shower this morning.

846
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,722
I got this.

847
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,408
You're so professional.

848
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:24,740
- I try.
- No, it's good.

849
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:26,888
You do good.

850
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:37,127
- Ready?
- Yeah.

851
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,980
I know I'm the type of guy who scares you.

852
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:49,900
I'm a big, loud, gay Jew.

853
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,820
You don't scare me.

854
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:56,448
Laurel Hester gave the
citizens of Ocean County justice

855
01:02:56,560 --> 01:03:01,540
for 23 years, and now she's asking you
to give her justice in return!

856
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:04,060
- You have the power!
- We don't have that option.

857
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:05,140
You do!

858
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:07,288
The Domestic Partnership Act

859
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:10,180
gives you the option to grant benefits!

860
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:13,363
You have the power!

861
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:20,980
This is not a local crowd,
they've been shipped in here.

862
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:22,684
No, I see some locals.

863
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:25,810
Please, please.

864
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,820
It is in your hands!

865
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:33,641
Ocean County cannot afford to do this.

866
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:36,087
Actually, we can afford it.

867
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:43,580
The question is, who tells us
how to spend the county's money?

868
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:46,220
That is for us and our
constituents to decide.

869
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:49,085
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

870
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:59,180
Shame on you!

871
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:01,140
- Yes? Hello.
- Hello.

872
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:06,340
Father John Thompson Quarty,

873
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:07,780
St. Mary's Episcopal church,
Point Pleasant Beach.

874
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:09,166
Laurel and Stacie have been to my church.

875
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:12,940
Now, I have heard that
some of you believe that

876
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:15,725
Laurel Hester's relationship
with Stacie Andree

877
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:20,420
is not sanctioned by God and that's why
you are taking this position...

878
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:21,900
No, no father...

879
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:27,420
Would you like to hear what Jesus
actually said about homosexuality?

880
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:31,570
I will tell you what
he said, and I quote...

881
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:41,660
That's right, Jesus
said nothing on the subject!

882
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:46,288
- But he said plenty about compassion!
- He didn't say anything!

883
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:49,210
Please.

884
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:55,660
Well, father, there are definitely
old testament verses that talk...

885
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:58,684
- You want to get sued here?
- Don't cut me off.

886
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:04,220
Ladies and gentlemen,
I understand this issue,

887
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:06,607
my uncle died of lung
cancer, it's terrible.

888
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:09,060
And I have always tried
to do the right thing,

889
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:11,460
but we need to look at the total picture.

890
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:14,900
Please, please, please, I am begging you,

891
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,606
I am begging you, do this for Laurel!

892
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:19,700
- You can do this!
- You have the power.

893
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:21,300
- You have the power.
- You have the power!

894
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:24,660
You have the power!

895
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:27,340
Get off your knees.

896
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:31,420
Listen to me, listen to me,
this is a circus, it's gonna backfire.

897
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:32,860
It's political theater.

898
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:35,645
And you know what, if you think
you can do better, there's the mic!

899
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:38,127
Unless you're afraid
they're gonna think you're gay.

900
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:43,964
Alright, alright!

901
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,980
- Hello Detective Wells.
- Hello.

902
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:49,605
Gentlemen.

903
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:54,340
I was born and raised in Ocean County,

904
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:59,970
I'm an Piney, or a constituent,
as Mr. Johnson would like to say.

905
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:04,460
I'm straight, by the way.

906
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:11,380
I also happen to be Laurel Hester's
partner on the force.

907
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:13,300
We've worked together
for many, many years now

908
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:16,483
and I can tell you from
firsthand experience

909
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:21,208
that she is about as fine an officer
as Ocean County could hope to have.

910
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:32,840
Now, Laurel, Stacie, and I could
solve this problem real quick, okay?

911
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,340
I could go get a justice of the peace,

912
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:38,380
take them to Laurel,
and we could get married.

913
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:43,300
And then when she dies,
I'd get her pension, no questions asked.

914
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:46,483
I could pass it along to Stacie,
no problem.

915
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:55,283
But we're not gonna do that because
Laurel would never agree to it.

916
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:01,780
I used to tease Laurel about
her integrity, her ideals,

917
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:05,885
because I'm one of those
cynical hard ass cops who likes

918
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:09,580
to say he doesn't believe
in the system, or justice.

919
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:12,411
But Laurel does.

920
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:17,044
She believes in the whole deal.

921
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:22,300
So what's it gonna be,
can I go to Laurel right now

922
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:27,930
and tell her she can die
in peace with dignity,

923
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:30,420
because she was right?

924
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:35,890
Because in this one instance,
justice has prevailed?

925
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:53,562
Thank you Detective Wells.

926
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:57,060
We anguish over this situation.

927
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:59,640
And Detective Hester is in our prayers.

928
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:01,260
But our decision's gonna have to stand.

929
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:04,489
The state made a bad law,
the state made a bad law

930
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,300
and it's up to them to fix it.

931
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:07,700
Not up to us!

932
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,100
So Detective Hester's request is denied.

933
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:12,407
This meeting is adjourned!

934
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:19,964
We tried the carrot,
now we're gonna try the stick!

935
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:23,140
The number one source of
income in this county is what?

936
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:25,660
Tourism! And what are we gonna do?

937
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:27,922
Boycott Ocean County!

938
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:31,340
Boycott Ocean County!
Boycott Ocean Country!

939
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,500
What the hell were you
doing in there, Bryan? Huh?

940
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,300
I'm in agony over this, okay?

941
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:37,801
My wife and daughter look at
me like I'm a serial killer.

942
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:39,740
I was watching you, you're on our side!

943
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:41,842
- I'm one vote out of five.
- Convince the others!

944
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:43,530
Oh, that's easy for you to say!

945
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:45,220
Where are your fellow cops?

946
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:47,380
You can't even get them
to come to a meeting.

947
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:50,300
Some people get a pension,
some people don't,

948
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:53,006
some people get two or three,
life isn't fair.

949
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:55,180
Does that help you sleep at night?

950
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:57,567
Kiss my ass.

951
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,570
Water?

952
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:47,485
Drink.

953
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,211
Thank you.

954
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:02,300
You look so tired.

955
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,300
Why don't you go home
and get some rest, huh?

956
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:05,740
- No.
- Come on.

957
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:07,888
No, I can't leave her. She needs me here.

958
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:10,340
Thanks, Mom.

959
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:12,249
Hey.

960
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:19,780
They turned her down, again.

961
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:22,042
I don't even know if I can tell her.

962
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,162
Tell him about the insurance.

963
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:26,884
- No.
- Tell him.

964
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,321
Come on, tell me about the insurance.

965
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:33,121
I got this letter from
the insurance company,

966
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:35,971
just saying that she has
like three sick days left

967
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:40,620
and then she loses her medical benefits
and life insurance and everything.

968
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:43,940
She's been fighting the insurance
companies, the doctors.

969
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:45,700
I can handle it.

970
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:48,963
- I'll do something.
- No, no.

971
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:50,660
Come on, let me take care of it.

972
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:53,570
I need to do something, please.

973
01:10:58,360 --> 01:10:59,771
Okay.

974
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:06,326
- Okay.
- Thanks.

975
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:31,811
What's this?

976
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:36,968
Any officer can assign his or her
sick days to another officer.

977
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:39,580
Yeah, but what if you get sick?

978
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:41,420
You're not gonna get those days back!

979
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:43,900
Am I right, chief?

980
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,580
You don't get 'em back.

981
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:48,762
So you're scewed.

982
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:10,886
You bleeding hearts.

983
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,940
That dyke wouldn't do it for me.

984
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:17,168
Yeah, she would.

985
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:26,660
Fine.

986
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:29,047
I'll give her one day.

987
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:33,050
One day!

988
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:37,245
- How about three?
- Don't push it.

989
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:38,580
Make it five, Toohey.

990
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:40,500
Fellas, fellas, don't pressure him.

991
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:44,241
You never know, he might get the sniffles.

992
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:47,780
Alright, five.

993
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:49,803
Happy?

994
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:04,248
We're standing by our decision,
just keep your men in line.

995
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:08,087
So now the police department's against us?

996
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:11,044
They're donating sick days,
it doesn't mean anyone's against us.

997
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:12,940
Have you read the papers?
We're being ridiculed!

998
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:14,883
Yeah, by who,
the New York Times? Who cares.

999
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,970
The local papers and supporting
Hester and I'm getting a lot of calls.

1000
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:20,606
- Yeah, from outsiders!
- And from the locals, Bill.

1001
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:26,180
It seems like we are
sticking to a losing position

1002
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:28,248
because of some personal beliefs.

1003
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,140
Why shouldn't I vote according
to my personal beliefs?

1004
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:31,401
I'm not ashamed of them!

1005
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:34,900
We give in on this,
we are putting this state

1006
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,700
one step closer to gay marriage,
and if I do that,

1007
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:39,290
how can I face my family, huh?

1008
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:41,243
My friends?

1009
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:55,965
What?

1010
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:59,500
Their Christmas is gonna suck.

1011
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,460
- Who?
- Those women.

1012
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:03,562
The ones you're screwing over.

1013
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:09,620
Mya... this is politics,

1014
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:13,020
I'm running for re-election next year,
I can do a lot of good for our town,

1015
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:15,220
but not if I lose my
job over this one thing.

1016
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:16,660
You understand?

1017
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:19,001
If you die, does mom get your pension?

1018
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:25,580
What do you want, Dane?

1019
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:28,740
What do you mean some people
get more than one pension?

1020
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:30,365
I never said that.

1021
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:32,860
Oh, yeah you did, something
about life isn't fair,

1022
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:35,060
some people have a pension, some don't,

1023
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:37,208
some have more than one.

1024
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:40,164
Do the freeholders get multiple pensions?

1025
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:45,124
I'm not gonna answer
that question directly.

1026
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:49,060
It's in the public record,
payroll department,

1027
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:50,969
and if you say I told you this,
I'll deny it.

1028
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:54,682
'Course you will.

1029
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:12,168
I don't know who that is.

1030
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,660
- Hello?
- Hey I need to talk to Laurel.

1031
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:18,500
- It's important.
- Okay.

1032
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:20,250
Laurel, it's Dane.

1033
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:24,540
Hey, partner.

1034
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:28,140
Hey, remember the Selco case?
It was like 5 years ago?

1035
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:30,208
Yeah, sure.

1036
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:33,500
They hid their names
in the records somehow,

1037
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,602
but you managed to find 'em anyway.

1038
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:36,820
How'd you do that?

1039
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:40,208
They used versions of their full names.

1040
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:44,940
An initial and a middle name
or, two initials.

1041
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:48,620
So a regular computer search
couldn't find them.

1042
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:52,964
Right, thanks, good night.

1043
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:56,964
- Yeah.
- Get some rest.

1044
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:15,300
So I think we're gonna start with a wide
and we're gonna move to a medium.

1045
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:17,340
All that matters is the close-up, right?

1046
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:19,180
Let me see what's going on
behind her eyes.

1047
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:20,700
- Hi, Stacie.
- Hi, Stacie.

1048
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,290
We're gonna finish with the close.

1049
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:25,210
It is a 30 second spot
supporting gay marriage.

1050
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:28,620
I'm fighting for equality.

1051
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:31,140
Laurel, come on!

1052
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:33,580
Like it or not, you're an activist.

1053
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:36,100
You're a gay marriage activist now.

1054
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:38,700
Just say it.
Just say the M word, just once.

1055
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,087
Equality.

1056
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:44,740
Can I have a minute, just a minute?

1057
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:46,740
Sure, yes.

1058
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:48,046
We'll be back.

1059
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:50,610
Let's step out, let's step out.

1060
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:58,442
- What's wrong?
- Do you want some apple sauce?

1061
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:02,685
No. What's wrong? What's wrong?

1062
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,380
I hate how he pushes this stuff on you.

1063
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:08,482
- Well, it's okay.
- No.

1064
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:11,180
It takes your energy
and then you don't want to eat.

1065
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:12,940
No, I have to do it, you know?

1066
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:15,820
I have to... I have to
do it while there's time.

1067
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:18,700
There is, there is.

1068
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:19,980
- No.
- Yeah.

1069
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,366
- We don't know that.
- Yeah.

1070
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:24,529
We don't know that, baby.

1071
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:28,645
You know, in the time I have
left my priority is you.

1072
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:33,164
I'm still a police officer.

1073
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:36,329
We're taught to do the right thing.

1074
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:39,140
I'm gonna do the right thing for you.

1075
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:45,486
The only thing I care about
is justice for the woman that I love.

1076
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:49,804
And that's you.

1077
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,809
Is that okay?

1078
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:58,970
Yeah.

1079
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:12,123
When you see this,
I will have passed away...

1080
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:16,300
from cancer.

1081
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:20,291
The county refused to give
death benefits to my partner.

1082
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:26,045
Gay couples are fighting for equality.

1083
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:29,201
Please support them.

1084
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:37,420
What makes you think
they'll change their minds?

1085
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:40,500
Instinct and something I found
out about their pensions.

1086
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:42,807
They need cover.

1087
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:45,060
How about this?

1088
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:48,243
How about the governor
says that thanks to the freeholders,

1089
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:51,300
he realizes that the domestic
partnership law is flawed

1090
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:53,971
and he is willing
to support changing the law.

1091
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:56,300
That way they go from villains to heroes.

1092
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:58,500
You have access to the governor?

1093
01:18:58,600 --> 01:18:59,860
Oh, honey, are you kidding me?

1094
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:01,962
That man is number three on my speed dial.

1095
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:05,848
Okay, that'll work.

1096
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:08,340
- And Steven?
- Yes?

1097
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:10,408
Don't call me honey.

1098
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:12,284
I love you, too.

1099
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:39,369
Let's set up right here.

1100
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:33,481
Where's Bill?

1101
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:37,860
He had to make a sudden
trip to Pennsylvania.

1102
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:40,406
- Family emergency.
- Bullshit.

1103
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:41,820
He thinks if he stays away

1104
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:44,287
we won't vote because we have to
vote in a unanimous block.

1105
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:45,845
That's the tradition.

1106
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:50,220
Dane Wells is prepared to
tell the press that some of us

1107
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:52,846
are getting multiple pensions.

1108
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:56,201
How does he know that?

1109
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,020
I told him.

1110
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:02,282
Why, is it a secret?

1111
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:05,260
No, it's not a secret.

1112
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,900
You know, Dane Wells,
can go screw himself.

1113
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,420
I do two jobs for the county,
I'll get two pensions, big deal.

1114
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:12,340
It's legal, and it's common.

1115
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:14,100
Imagine the headlines.

1116
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:17,340
Freeholders get several pensions
while dying cop gets none.

1117
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:19,900
We'll look like idiots
if we change our minds now!

1118
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,460
We'll look like we cave!

1119
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:23,180
That's what you do
when your ass is against the wall!

1120
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:24,820
- You cave!
- If Bill's absent, we can't vote.

1121
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:27,420
The board of freeholders
doesn't reverse itself.

1122
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:28,620
That's all there is to it.

1123
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:30,210
Besides, if Bill's absent, we can't vote.

1124
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:31,300
We need to cancel the meeting.

1125
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:34,563
We are not canceling the meeting!

1126
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:37,000
That's the governor.

1127
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:40,090
Governor's got no authority
over county officials.

1128
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:44,164
Governor!

1129
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:50,500
What's going on out there?

1130
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:53,763
You know, the freeholder meeting
about that lesbian's pension.

1131
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:05,180
Where you going?

1132
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:06,770
Going down to that freeholder meeting.

1133
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:14,300
I'm gonna show my support
for another gay cop.

1134
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:17,961
Does anybody have anything
they want to say about that?

1135
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,604
How about you, Toohey?

1136
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:40,740
I'm going in my office
and I'm closing the door,

1137
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:44,401
and if anybody wants to
duck out, for any reason,

1138
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:47,448
I won't notice.

1139
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:17,000
You have the power!

1140
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:57,685
'Bout time.

1141
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:18,820
Ladies and gentlemen,
please, please, please.

1142
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:22,481
Now, we've called this meeting today to...

1143
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:53,220
We're here today to address
the issue of extending

1144
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:56,660
domestic partnership
benefits to county employees.

1145
01:24:56,760 --> 01:25:00,242
So if anyone wishes to make a comment,
now would be a good time.

1146
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:22,204
I just wanted to let you know...
that time is of the essence.

1147
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:27,849
All I'm asking is that you make change.

1148
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:35,569
You okay?

1149
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:01,049
I hate speaking in public.

1150
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:04,167
I really hate it.

1151
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:09,100
And I never really cared about
this whole pension thing,

1152
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:14,684
I never understood why is
was so important to Laurel.

1153
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:19,527
But now I think I get it.

1154
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:25,540
We're just average people.

1155
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:32,330
We have a house
and a dog and we pay our taxes.

1156
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:36,660
We're not perfect, I mean,
we have our differences

1157
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:38,980
and our disagreements.

1158
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:43,404
I love motorcycles and she hates them.

1159
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:48,210
Our house isn't fancy.

1160
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:51,300
But it was a labor of love.

1161
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:53,820
You know, working on it and renovating it

1162
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:58,620
and Laurel put a lot of thought
into every detail, you know,

1163
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:02,820
the light fixtures and the tile.

1164
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:09,700
And... we worked so hard on it

1165
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:13,441
'cause we thought we were
gonna live in it forever.

1166
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:20,729
But I guess that's not gonna happen.

1167
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:28,740
So the house, well, I'd just
really like to hold on to it,

1168
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:31,446
you know, to remember...

1169
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:36,771
to remember how much we love each other.

1170
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:41,290
Thank you.

1171
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:45,284
Thank you.

1172
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:05,060
On the motion of extending
domestic partnership benefits

1173
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:09,848
to county employees,
Freeholder Kelder how do you vote?

1174
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:13,084
Yes.

1175
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:16,164
Freeholder Wickery?

1176
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,922
Freeholder Wickery?

1177
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:25,885
Yes.

1178
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:29,927
Freeholder Santucci?

1179
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:34,885
Thanks for hanging me out to dry.

1180
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:39,769
I vote yes.

1181
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:46,041
It's unanimous, the motion has passed!

1182
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:48,689
I love you guys!

1183
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:53,020
I love you! Thank you, thank you!

1184
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:55,327
For opening your hearts!

1185
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:50,380
Hey, Laurel.

1186
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:52,740
How you doing, chief?

1187
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:56,500
We got a conviction against the men
who killed Tommy and Debbie Cherico.

1188
01:29:56,600 --> 01:30:00,127
Put 'em away for life, thanks to you.

1189
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:02,420
And we're pleased to inform you

1190
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:05,020
that you've been promoted
to the rank of lieutenant

1191
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:06,929
in the Ocean County Police Department.

1192
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:22,687
Congratulations.

1193
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:25,563
Thanks, chief.

1194
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:29,487
Congratulations, partner.

1195
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:48,089
Let me see.

1196
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:54,761
Will you marry me?

1197
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:11,049
I love you.

1198
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:14,407
I love you.

1199
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:19,207
I love you.

1200
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:58,129
Present, huh!

1201
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:03,805
Order, huh!

1202
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:07,450
About face.

1203
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:32,130
Come and get it.
