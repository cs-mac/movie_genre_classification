1
00:02:44,334 --> 00:02:45,836
-Name.
-Seol-woo Kim.

2
00:02:46,336 --> 00:02:50,173
-Age.
-I was born in 1609. Age, 409 years.

3
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,016
Do you have a girlfriend?

4
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,394
I love...

5
00:03:04,896 --> 00:03:05,814
you.

6
00:03:19,202 --> 00:03:22,164
-What an amusing man.
-My gut feelings are never wrong.

7
00:03:22,247 --> 00:03:23,707
He's dangerous as well.

8
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:26,334
That's why he's useful.

9
00:03:30,255 --> 00:03:32,007
INTERROGATION IN PROCESS

10
00:03:34,134 --> 00:03:37,345
There are three types of South Korean
secret agents.

11
00:03:38,054 --> 00:03:39,973
White, which operates publicly
with their own names.

12
00:03:40,056 --> 00:03:42,309
Black, which operates nameless
and in the dark.

13
00:03:42,934 --> 00:03:45,812
Then it's Ghost,
which are planted more deeply

14
00:03:46,146 --> 00:03:49,191
with fake identities
and operate discreetly.

15
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:55,155
I want you to be a Ghost
operating internationally.

16
00:03:55,447 --> 00:03:56,531
What do you say?

17
00:03:57,783 --> 00:03:59,451
-Sure.
-I like how quick you are.

18
00:04:00,535 --> 00:04:02,913
Let me give you a piece of advice
for the first and last time.

19
00:04:04,539 --> 00:04:05,749
Don't trust anyone.

20
00:04:07,167 --> 00:04:09,252
-I don't even trust myself.
-Good.

EPISODE 1

27
00:05:13,316 --> 00:05:17,279
If you were in charge of marketing
for the Relief Organization,

28
00:05:18,446 --> 00:05:20,615
which picture would you use?

29
00:05:22,534 --> 00:05:25,370
The picture that shows despair
and reality?

30
00:05:26,162 --> 00:05:29,791
Or the picture with hope and dreams?

31
00:05:32,294 --> 00:05:33,211
Your choice.

32
00:05:34,546 --> 00:05:38,216
Well, I think the picture with
the sad child would get more donations.

33
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,263
So you think we need to use a strong image
to get people to open up their wallets.

34
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:47,642
Then what about next time? Do the images
have to get stronger and stronger?

35
00:05:48,226 --> 00:05:51,104
-Well, if it's for marketing...
-Do you think that's morally right?

36
00:05:51,187 --> 00:05:55,567
Would you still make the same decision
if you were the family of that child?

37
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,487
Miss Anna Liebert?

38
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,164
Helping someone is more complicated
than you think.

39
00:06:09,914 --> 00:06:13,126
When you're out there, dilemma never ends.

40
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,595
Have we met?

41
00:06:24,512 --> 00:06:25,430
No.

42
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:29,684
Then how do you know my real name?
No one is supposed to know.

43
00:06:30,435 --> 00:06:31,770
Not even the professors.

44
00:06:33,271 --> 00:06:35,982
There is always a woman behind every case.

45
00:07:06,262 --> 00:07:09,849
Love is a useful deception and tactic
to a secret agent.

46
00:07:38,837 --> 00:07:41,548
However, whereas I am with someone
who is high on the romance,

47
00:07:43,216 --> 00:07:45,552
I feel loneliness and indifference.

48
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,808
Anna Maria. Real name, Anna Liebert.

49
00:07:52,934 --> 00:07:55,311
The only daughter of the mafia boss.

50
00:08:06,448 --> 00:08:07,907
He adores his daughter

51
00:08:08,825 --> 00:08:11,745
and was in the secret police
during the dictatorship.

52
00:08:24,215 --> 00:08:28,219
Inferior races
have their special physical abilities.

53
00:08:30,138 --> 00:08:31,765
Just like a secret police officer
would say.

54
00:09:03,588 --> 00:09:06,299
He won't let me interfere,
since I know his secret.

55
00:09:07,425 --> 00:09:08,384
Do you think so?

56
00:09:09,385 --> 00:09:11,137
He'll remove me
from his daughter's side for sure.

57
00:09:12,347 --> 00:09:13,807
He was with the secret police after all.

58
00:09:16,392 --> 00:09:18,520
I wonder if he'll move as we hope.

59
00:09:19,104 --> 00:09:20,897
People don't change that easily.

60
00:09:23,483 --> 00:09:24,317
I have a guest.

61
00:09:24,943 --> 00:09:25,944
I'll call you when I'm back.

62
00:09:47,423 --> 00:09:51,219
I'm willing to go quietly,
but you probably won't be that nice.

63
00:10:56,284 --> 00:10:57,702
You're the cop.

64
00:10:58,786 --> 00:11:01,414
Who must I be,
if I'm facing off against you?

65
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:07,378
That's right. You guessed right.

66
00:11:08,463 --> 00:11:09,297
I'm a villain.

67
00:11:12,091 --> 00:11:13,217
The worst there is.

68
00:11:27,774 --> 00:11:34,197
CAPTAIN IRON 2, THE RETURN OF DARK DEATH

69
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:39,953
You're a villain, but you aren't evil.
So are you really the antagonist?

70
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:43,831
Hollywood contracts are strict
regarding spoilers.

71
00:11:44,332 --> 00:11:45,375
I understand.

72
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:48,336
We can't leave out how you rose
to international stardom.

73
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:52,006
In the Chinese 3D movie in which
you played Wu-jing Sha... There it is.

74
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:55,551
When The Magical Journey to the West
became a box office hit,

75
00:11:55,635 --> 00:11:57,762
you rose to stardom.

76
00:11:57,845 --> 00:12:01,265
Many are saying
it was an unexpected stroke of luck.

77
00:12:01,516 --> 00:12:05,186
To be clear, I rose to stardom
because I did well.

78
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:09,732
It was possible because of our agency,
Do-ha Cha's imaginative planning too.

79
00:12:20,118 --> 00:12:21,953
Okay. I understand.

80
00:12:22,537 --> 00:12:26,165
Let's move onto Dark Death,
which was released yesterday.

81
00:12:26,249 --> 00:12:28,835
I would like to know
why you chose a superhero movie.

82
00:12:28,918 --> 00:12:30,086
It was the pay.

83
00:12:31,629 --> 00:12:33,881
Would you like to walk
the Cannes' red carpet?

84
00:12:33,965 --> 00:12:36,092
The movies I liked as a child

85
00:12:36,384 --> 00:12:38,970
had characters who could do
a 540-degree spin kick.

86
00:12:39,053 --> 00:12:43,725
My goodness.

87
00:12:44,017 --> 00:12:45,309
Yes.

88
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:49,772
Shooting a gun from each hand
with a matchstick in his mouth...

89
00:18:37,536 --> 00:18:39,580
If you're ever in Russia, contact me.

90
00:18:39,664 --> 00:18:40,873
Okay.

91
00:18:44,794 --> 00:18:46,712
-Bye.
-Bye.

92
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,736
petrov has been broken out of prison.

93
00:19:21,622 --> 00:19:24,041
MARCH 15 SQUARE

94
00:19:25,751 --> 00:19:30,005
Lieutenant Eun-oh Ko met with
Major petrov of the Russian Army

95
00:19:30,506 --> 00:19:33,509
and came to an agreement
to share military technologies.

96
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:38,681
The two armies plan to discuss
the development of weapons

97
00:19:38,889 --> 00:19:41,392
as well as training methods.

98
00:19:42,017 --> 00:19:46,188
When working undercover, how you end it
is more important than how you start it.

99
00:19:49,984 --> 00:19:52,403
I'm going to check
that we're not being followed.

100
00:19:52,486 --> 00:19:56,449
Meet me at the back entrance
in 20 minutes. I love you.

101
00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:17,720
The sympathy of a woman in love is safer
than a bulletproof vest,

102
00:20:19,513 --> 00:20:21,432
but the wrath
of a woman betrayed by her love

103
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,269
is deadlier than a time bomb.

104
00:20:32,067 --> 00:20:35,154
The best way to end a relationship
that has served its use

105
00:20:36,614 --> 00:20:37,531
is death.

106
00:21:12,149 --> 00:21:15,277
November 7th, 11:00 a.m.
Greenwich time. Agent K.

107
00:21:16,195 --> 00:21:18,072
Budapest mission complete.

108
00:21:54,733 --> 00:21:56,235
Please wake up.

109
00:21:56,318 --> 00:21:58,362
I can't move.

110
00:21:58,445 --> 00:22:01,448
I can't move. I just can't move.

111
00:22:01,532 --> 00:22:03,951
You need to get up. It's past seven.

112
00:22:04,034 --> 00:22:07,079
No. I know the time. Your watch is fast.

113
00:22:07,162 --> 00:22:10,583
No. We have to be in Yangsu-ri by nine.
We'll be late even if we leave now.

114
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:15,087
Hey. If I'm late,
you can just drive faster.

115
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,839
You can go 100km per hour.

116
00:22:16,922 --> 00:22:18,591
Even if I do, we'll be 20 minutes late.

117
00:22:18,674 --> 00:22:22,428
Then go 150km. That means I can sleep
for ten more minutes.

118
00:22:22,511 --> 00:22:24,221
See how quickly I calculated that?
I'm a genius.

119
00:22:28,976 --> 00:22:30,561
I hate the gong.

120
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:33,397
Croissants from Itaewon Bakery.

121
00:22:33,522 --> 00:22:35,858
A salad with baby greens
and organic apples from Apgujeong Cafe.

122
00:22:35,941 --> 00:22:38,402
Fresh drip Jongro Coffee
made three minutes ago.

123
00:22:38,485 --> 00:22:40,237
Also, here is your dessert.

124
00:22:43,616 --> 00:22:46,535
-What's the dressing?
-I got you oriental dressing.

125
00:22:48,621 --> 00:22:53,792
Jongro Coffee is the best at waking me up.

126
00:22:53,876 --> 00:22:56,170
The cup design looks different.

127
00:22:56,253 --> 00:22:58,589
A branch opened in Hannam.

128
00:22:58,672 --> 00:23:01,091
All the better, now that it's close by.

129
00:23:02,217 --> 00:23:04,094
-Get me Jongro Coffee.
-It is Jongro Coffee.

130
00:23:04,178 --> 00:23:08,432
I want Jongro Coffee from Jongro,
not Jongro Coffee from Hannam.

131
00:23:08,932 --> 00:23:12,394
We don't have time. You have many scenes
to shoot today. If you're any later...

132
00:23:12,478 --> 00:23:16,065
Are you planning to make your actor
skip breakfast?

133
00:23:16,649 --> 00:23:18,859
What if my blood sugar level drops
and I faint?

134
00:23:18,942 --> 00:23:22,363
Also, what if I have to get surgery?
Then the shoot will be delayed even more.

135
00:23:22,613 --> 00:23:25,741
No... the movie will be canceled.
Well, you just got the movie canceled

136
00:23:25,824 --> 00:23:28,243
just because you didn't get
Jongro Coffee from Jongro.

137
00:23:28,327 --> 00:23:30,245
It's just a different color.

138
00:23:30,329 --> 00:23:31,497
Go.

139
00:23:31,664 --> 00:23:32,665
Go!

140
00:23:38,087 --> 00:23:40,881
Hello.

141
00:23:40,964 --> 00:23:42,091
Why are you so late?

142
00:23:42,174 --> 00:23:44,176
I'm sorry. We tried to rush, but...

143
00:23:44,259 --> 00:23:45,302
Sheesh.

144
00:23:47,221 --> 00:23:48,430
-Hello.
-Hello.

145
00:23:51,016 --> 00:23:52,976
GREAT ACTOR, UN-GWANG YEO

146
00:23:57,481 --> 00:23:59,316
What a nice day.

147
00:24:03,696 --> 00:24:05,364
-Hey.
-Hello.

148
00:24:06,699 --> 00:24:10,452
We had to take a detour
because Mr. Yang got lost.

149
00:24:11,036 --> 00:24:15,416
Everyone makes mistakes once in a while,
but he makes them often.

150
00:24:15,499 --> 00:24:18,293
Mr. Yang. Apologize sincerely.

151
00:24:18,377 --> 00:24:19,545
I'm sorry.

152
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:25,259
In exchange, I'll make sure
not to make any mistakes,

153
00:24:25,342 --> 00:24:28,011
so that we can do it
all in one take, okay?

154
00:24:28,095 --> 00:24:29,096
I'm counting on you.

155
00:24:31,765 --> 00:24:34,268
-I'll have to work really hard.
-Good luck.

156
00:24:34,351 --> 00:24:35,686
I'll repay you for your faith in me.

157
00:24:35,769 --> 00:24:37,438
-Good luck.
-Seriously...

158
00:24:38,564 --> 00:24:40,691
-How's your debut preparation going?
-Great, of course.

159
00:24:40,774 --> 00:24:43,152
What you showed me last time was awesome.

160
00:24:44,194 --> 00:24:46,488
Jongro coffee from Jongro.

161
00:24:50,909 --> 00:24:52,119
BIG STAR, UN-GWANG YEO

162
00:25:11,221 --> 00:25:12,306
Come at me!

163
00:25:12,389 --> 00:25:14,141
DELINQUENT BROTHERS

164
00:25:15,642 --> 00:25:17,978
Here. Organic Cheongdam Lemonade.

165
00:25:19,313 --> 00:25:21,064
-Hello.
-Hello.

166
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,317
Is it from Cheongdam?

167
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,943
It's not from Cheongdam Lemonade
in Yeouido, right?

168
00:25:25,027 --> 00:25:27,237
-What are you babbling about?
-I don't know.

169
00:25:27,321 --> 00:25:30,991
Maybe it's because he is an action star.

170
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,911
He's so fit and doesn't he have
a great figure?

171
00:25:52,888 --> 00:25:55,390
He's more beautiful than a flower.

172
00:26:02,356 --> 00:26:03,398
Hey.

173
00:26:04,066 --> 00:26:06,985
-I'm sorry.
-Get your act together!

174
00:26:08,612 --> 00:26:11,323
Hey. It's okay. It's okay.

175
00:26:11,448 --> 00:26:14,785
I'm good at that.
I'm awesome at blocking hits.

176
00:26:15,369 --> 00:26:16,328
Don't let it get you down.

177
00:26:16,411 --> 00:26:17,830
Okay, let's go.

178
00:26:18,413 --> 00:26:19,957
Let's take it from the top.

179
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,083
-From the top.
-Okay.

180
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:22,918
Here.

181
00:26:23,794 --> 00:26:25,504
How can someone be so perfect?

182
00:26:25,587 --> 00:26:27,965
-A perfect fake.
-He's human.

183
00:26:28,048 --> 00:26:29,967
He is humanity's enemy.
He may be an alien.

184
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:31,635
My Love From The Star?

185
00:26:32,177 --> 00:26:34,137
-Soo-hyun Kim or Un-gwang?
-Un-gwang, obviously.

186
00:26:34,221 --> 00:26:36,348
-Un-gwang or ten million dollars?
-Definitely the latter.

187
00:26:36,807 --> 00:26:38,684
At least you're not
in critical condition yet.

188
00:26:40,227 --> 00:26:41,270
Un-gwang likes money.

189
00:26:47,901 --> 00:26:48,735
Here he comes.

190
00:26:50,737 --> 00:26:53,615
Why did you skip
the Top Ten Corporations Luncheon

191
00:26:53,699 --> 00:26:55,534
at the Blue House and come here instead?

192
00:26:55,742 --> 00:26:57,327
My promise to my son comes first.

193
00:26:57,411 --> 00:27:01,582
Why did you send your son to a
public school rather than private school?

194
00:27:01,665 --> 00:27:05,085
I want to raise a child who gets
almost everything regarding education.

195
00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:07,170
I will raise him to be a child

196
00:27:07,254 --> 00:27:10,048
who knows how much the bus fare costs
and knows how to share with others.

197
00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:14,469
Some question if you're doing this
because you want to enter politics.

198
00:27:14,553 --> 00:27:18,891
Let me make it clear that politics
is not for me. I'm here as a dad.

199
00:27:18,974 --> 00:27:20,309
There she is.

200
00:27:21,977 --> 00:27:24,062
Hello.

201
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:29,902
Honey.

202
00:27:31,069 --> 00:27:32,946
-Hi.
-Good job.

203
00:27:34,823 --> 00:27:38,577
Don't smile too much. When Jae-young
comes out, pick him up naturally.

204
00:27:41,288 --> 00:27:42,331
Okay.

205
00:27:45,292 --> 00:27:46,168
Here he comes.

206
00:27:46,668 --> 00:27:48,003
-Honey.
-Mom!

207
00:27:50,005 --> 00:27:52,341
-Come here.
-Did you have fun?

208
00:27:53,634 --> 00:27:54,801
What?

209
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,779
Are you really going to stand against me
and Songsan, Congressman Kim?

210
00:28:13,862 --> 00:28:17,658
You don't belong in the political world.

211
00:28:19,076 --> 00:28:23,497
You took a box home from this room
frequently when my grandfather was around.

212
00:28:24,957 --> 00:28:28,752
Just because he passed away,
did you bury those memories as well?

213
00:28:28,835 --> 00:28:31,922
You make it sound
like I took bribes or something.

214
00:28:32,506 --> 00:28:33,882
Do you have evidence to back that up?

215
00:28:34,925 --> 00:28:38,011
All I did in this room
was eat a few hot meals

216
00:28:38,887 --> 00:28:41,390
that your grandfather had prepared for me.

217
00:28:42,349 --> 00:28:43,767
Then you should accept mine, too.

218
00:28:51,525 --> 00:28:53,860
It's more satisfying
than the Seoul mayoral elections

219
00:28:53,944 --> 00:28:57,155
in which you would come in third
at best anyway.

220
00:28:58,115 --> 00:29:01,535
Your sweet granddaughter is studying
in Chicago, is she not?

221
00:29:01,994 --> 00:29:04,538
-Is that a threat?
-It's a gift.

222
00:29:07,749 --> 00:29:08,583
Goodness.

223
00:29:10,711 --> 00:29:12,170
I don't know about this.

224
00:29:13,338 --> 00:29:16,049
In consideration of my long relationship
with your grandfather,

225
00:29:16,591 --> 00:29:18,343
I will withdraw from the election.

226
00:29:35,027 --> 00:29:37,195
You have no spirit, you filthy pig.

227
00:29:37,988 --> 00:29:40,991
You know people take pictures
at the dining table nowadays, right?

228
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:54,338
There is a new king,
so there are new rules too.

229
00:30:03,472 --> 00:30:06,850
We've lost touch with Ghost Agent Y.
I think he's been taken out.

230
00:30:06,933 --> 00:30:08,352
Are you saying his cover was blown?

231
00:30:08,435 --> 00:30:11,938
His cover was perfect. He was able to go
deep and gain the trust of those involved

232
00:30:12,022 --> 00:30:13,857
with Songsan's chairman,
Mr. Mo's slush fund.

233
00:30:14,441 --> 00:30:15,901
But they still got him.

234
00:30:18,278 --> 00:30:20,489
That means we have a traitor
on the inside.

235
00:30:21,365 --> 00:30:24,534
Was it Congressman In-soo Baek's
secret organization, the Baek Infantry?

236
00:30:24,618 --> 00:30:27,621
We can't trust anyone on the inside.
I'll call in an international agent.

237
00:30:27,704 --> 00:30:29,623
Do you have someone in mind?

238
00:30:30,415 --> 00:30:31,500
Yes, sir.

239
00:31:48,285 --> 00:31:51,079
Hello. Thank you.

240
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,665
Room service.

241
00:31:55,876 --> 00:31:59,463
What now? What? What is it now?

242
00:32:03,258 --> 00:32:05,093
What are you up to now?

243
00:32:05,927 --> 00:32:07,804
What's with the mustache?

244
00:32:08,388 --> 00:32:09,931
-Is it obvious?
-Yes. Very.

245
00:32:10,015 --> 00:32:11,099
Darn it.

246
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,519
Just go back to being an agent then.
Quit being a prosecutor.

247
00:32:15,145 --> 00:32:17,939
I can't. My wife will kill me.

248
00:32:19,483 --> 00:32:21,860
Then why did you follow me here?

249
00:32:21,943 --> 00:32:26,114
To give you your mission. My mission
is to follow you and manage you.

250
00:32:26,198 --> 00:32:27,866
I'm your commanding officer.

251
00:32:27,991 --> 00:32:29,284
-Me?
-Yes.

252
00:32:29,659 --> 00:32:32,579
-Goodness. I'm on vacation.
-It's urgent, that's why.

253
00:32:33,705 --> 00:32:37,542
Okay. Look. You know the code, right?

254
00:32:39,586 --> 00:32:43,423
Your birthday, 0906.
Half the hotel staff must know.

255
00:32:43,507 --> 00:32:44,341
That's right.

256
00:32:45,717 --> 00:32:46,718
Goodness.

257
00:32:47,302 --> 00:32:48,178
What is it?

258
00:32:49,387 --> 00:32:50,722
I think Agent Yoon's been taken out.

259
00:32:53,975 --> 00:32:56,645
He disappeared
after sending a text message.

260
00:32:57,562 --> 00:33:00,106
Container 8675 to Incheon October 4th.
Look for three wood carvings. Y.

261
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:02,025
"Look for three wood carvings."

262
00:33:02,108 --> 00:33:05,862
Yes. We're tracking the container
as per the clue he sent.

263
00:33:09,199 --> 00:33:10,909
-What's my new identity?
-We're looking.

264
00:33:10,992 --> 00:33:12,035
Where is the mission?

265
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,414
Somewhere nobody knows you.

266
00:33:20,126 --> 00:33:23,713
Okay. Look here.

267
00:33:47,445 --> 00:33:49,030
-Would you like some?
-I'm fine.

268
00:33:49,531 --> 00:33:50,615
This is the last one.

269
00:33:52,659 --> 00:33:54,160
You must really want some.

270
00:33:56,538 --> 00:33:58,164
-Here.
-There is a way.

271
00:34:05,589 --> 00:34:07,507
Cut. Okay.

272
00:34:08,341 --> 00:34:09,634
-Was that okay?
-Yes, it was good.

273
00:34:10,635 --> 00:34:13,597
-The emotions were good.
-Thank you.

274
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,223
You looked good together.

275
00:34:15,849 --> 00:34:19,936
Next is the kissing scene.
We'll be zooming in,

276
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:22,230
-so make it hot.
-Okay.

277
00:34:23,481 --> 00:34:26,776
-Stunt team. Get ready.
-Yes, sir.

278
00:34:27,193 --> 00:34:28,862
Let's use a stunt double.

279
00:34:30,155 --> 00:34:31,156
A stunt double?

280
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:33,450
You said it's a kiss scene.
We should use a stunt double then.

281
00:34:33,783 --> 00:34:37,412
You did all the action scenes yourself
without using a stunt double.

282
00:34:37,495 --> 00:34:39,205
So why do you...

283
00:34:39,289 --> 00:34:42,626
I can hit things with my head
or a car, but not my lips.

284
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,586
I don't do that.

285
00:34:45,295 --> 00:34:46,254
Okay?

286
00:34:51,885 --> 00:34:52,927
I'm speechless.

287
00:34:54,054 --> 00:34:56,514
-It must be true.
-What is?

288
00:34:57,098 --> 00:35:00,268
That he can't kiss actresses.

289
00:35:03,313 --> 00:35:04,773
That feels nice.

290
00:35:11,196 --> 00:35:12,280
Good job for today.

291
00:35:14,074 --> 00:35:15,116
Sure.

292
00:35:15,909 --> 00:35:20,288
I was a bit pissed off earlier,
but it's okay. I understand.

293
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:23,583
-What?
-Not being able to kiss a woman.

294
00:35:25,794 --> 00:35:27,587
-Me?
-I won't tell anyone,

295
00:35:28,254 --> 00:35:29,422
so don't worry.

296
00:35:35,178 --> 00:35:36,930
-What are you doing?
-Teaching you the facts.

297
00:35:37,013 --> 00:35:40,642
I don't do kissing scenes,
but I'm a good kisser.

298
00:35:50,235 --> 00:35:51,945
My phone.

299
00:35:55,281 --> 00:35:56,199
Who is it?

300
00:35:56,783 --> 00:35:59,327
What? The agency. The agency.

301
00:36:02,163 --> 00:36:04,499
-Hi, Ms. Cha.
-Where are you?

302
00:36:04,582 --> 00:36:07,919
I'm talking to Director Hong
about the movie.

303
00:36:08,545 --> 00:36:10,922
-It's running longer than expected.
-Okay.

304
00:36:11,214 --> 00:36:14,008
You should continue talking,
I'll call you later.

305
00:36:17,971 --> 00:36:20,765
-This isn't right.
-Why? Is something wrong?

306
00:36:20,849 --> 00:36:22,517
I feel like something will happen.

307
00:36:23,643 --> 00:36:26,229
I feel like something big
and ominous is approaching.

308
00:36:26,312 --> 00:36:27,522
What are you talking about?

309
00:36:34,362 --> 00:36:37,031
What is that?

310
00:36:37,115 --> 00:36:39,534
Hey, stop! Stop! Stop!

311
00:36:39,617 --> 00:36:41,911
-What's going on?
-Stop! Hold on. Stop!

312
00:36:41,995 --> 00:36:43,955
-Stop! Hey!
-What's wrong with her?

313
00:36:44,122 --> 00:36:45,248
Stay still.

314
00:36:47,584 --> 00:36:52,005
Hey, Ms. Cha!
What do you think you're doing?

315
00:36:52,255 --> 00:36:54,883
Who is she? She must be crazy.

316
00:36:59,596 --> 00:37:01,681
Hello, Director Hong.

317
00:37:01,765 --> 00:37:05,560
You got a whole bunch of plastic surgery
within those few hours.

318
00:37:06,561 --> 00:37:07,479
She really must be crazy.

319
00:37:08,062 --> 00:37:12,650
Hey, Ms. Cha. First, calm down.
We should talk about it

320
00:37:13,234 --> 00:37:16,029
and resolve it rationally.
You shouldn't resort to violence!

321
00:37:16,112 --> 00:37:17,572
-Whatever.
-What?

322
00:37:17,655 --> 00:37:21,159
I promised you the last time
you got caught, didn't I?

323
00:37:21,242 --> 00:37:23,995
That if I catch you again,
you and I will both die.

324
00:37:24,829 --> 00:37:27,749
But I realized it wouldn't be fair
for me to die,

325
00:37:27,832 --> 00:37:30,126
so I'll just kill you.

326
00:37:31,377 --> 00:37:34,172
Hey. Ms. Cha. Calm down, will you?

327
00:37:35,215 --> 00:37:38,134
Hey. Hey, calm down.

328
00:37:38,218 --> 00:37:40,178
Hey. Hold on. Hold on.

329
00:37:40,261 --> 00:37:41,513
Is she your manager?

330
00:37:42,305 --> 00:37:44,557
-She wouldn't really drop us, would she?
-She could.

331
00:37:44,641 --> 00:37:46,643
She used to be in my fan club.
She's totally capable.

332
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:50,772
A fangirl? Ms. Cha!
I never made a promise or anything.

333
00:37:50,855 --> 00:37:53,858
-Goodness. Hold on!
-Can't you let me off...

334
00:37:53,942 --> 00:37:56,361
-Please?
-That self-centered witch.

335
00:37:56,444 --> 00:37:58,988
-Please?
-I ought to just...

336
00:38:00,532 --> 00:38:01,783
Hey!

337
00:38:03,117 --> 00:38:06,830
Hey! Where are we going? Hey.
Hey! Ms. Cha!

338
00:38:13,586 --> 00:38:16,214
I mean it.
We were only talking about the movie.

339
00:38:16,297 --> 00:38:18,800
I said it was Director Hong
in case you got it wrong...

340
00:38:19,467 --> 00:38:23,471
Do-ha. We're not late to a shoot.
Why are you speeding?

341
00:38:24,472 --> 00:38:28,560
You'll blind the drivers on the other side
if you keep the high beam on, Do-ha.

342
00:38:29,769 --> 00:38:32,897
Please calm down. Please.

343
00:38:34,023 --> 00:38:36,484
Fine, I did it. I did. I kissed her.

344
00:38:36,568 --> 00:38:40,697
This old man wasn't thinking.
It's my lips' fault. These wretched lips.

345
00:38:49,038 --> 00:38:51,749
Why are you so extreme?

346
00:38:55,253 --> 00:38:57,839
I know you're in your prime.

347
00:38:57,964 --> 00:39:02,093
A man in his 40s is perfect financially,
physically and professionally.

348
00:39:03,219 --> 00:39:04,804
Love isn't a sin.

349
00:39:06,472 --> 00:39:07,557
Is it?

350
00:39:10,518 --> 00:39:11,728
I guess not.

351
00:39:12,228 --> 00:39:14,814
But a star like you dating is a sin.

352
00:39:15,189 --> 00:39:16,983
You shouldn't have gotten caught.

353
00:39:18,818 --> 00:39:20,111
Do-ha.

354
00:39:21,446 --> 00:39:24,032
Do-ha!

355
00:39:27,493 --> 00:39:29,621
Ever since you went
to Jae-young's kindergarten,

356
00:39:30,455 --> 00:39:33,207
the media has been very favorable.

357
00:39:33,791 --> 00:39:35,668
You have such a good sense.

358
00:39:36,711 --> 00:39:40,048
I've lived my entire life in politics,
but I'm learning from you.

359
00:39:41,257 --> 00:39:42,467
It's thanks to my wife.

360
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:46,054
She used to be a celebrity,
so she knows what the public wants.

361
00:39:46,137 --> 00:39:50,016
May I have her join my campaign staff
for the mayoral election?

362
00:39:53,311 --> 00:39:56,314
Congressman Kim won't be greedy
any longer.

363
00:39:56,397 --> 00:39:58,316
Thanks to you,

364
00:39:58,858 --> 00:40:01,903
I think this election will go smoothly.

365
00:40:07,325 --> 00:40:10,328
This is the land on Jeju Island.
It should be the amount you mentioned.

366
00:40:12,914 --> 00:40:17,418
If you add it to your campaign fund,
you can write up a receipt, right?

367
00:40:22,215 --> 00:40:23,716
Just kidding. Go ahead and use it.

368
00:40:24,342 --> 00:40:27,220
But no matter how wealthy I am,

369
00:40:27,512 --> 00:40:29,597
I won't keep having money
that I can't get receipts for.

370
00:40:30,181 --> 00:40:33,142
I'll do whatever it takes
to find the missing wood carvings.

371
00:40:35,603 --> 00:40:39,440
They are the details of the slush fund
my grandfather saved for 40 years.

372
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:44,904
Without them, I have to keep bribing
people like Congressman Kim.

373
00:40:45,488 --> 00:40:47,782
My connections from
the NIS are working on it.

374
00:40:47,865 --> 00:40:51,160
Discreet operations like these
are my specialty.

375
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:53,371
Please give it your all.

376
00:41:02,964 --> 00:41:03,798
INTERNATIONAL ARRIVALS

377
00:41:04,966 --> 00:41:05,800
ARRIVED

378
00:41:53,931 --> 00:41:55,850
Ghost Agent K has begun tracking it

379
00:41:56,684 --> 00:41:59,395
based on the text message
the missing agent sent.

380
00:42:00,813 --> 00:42:02,732
How interesting.

381
00:42:03,524 --> 00:42:06,486
-A ghost agent. A nameless shadow.
-Right.

382
00:42:06,652 --> 00:42:08,863
-What a great concept.
-It totally is.

383
00:42:09,363 --> 00:42:11,282
But what did K do before?

384
00:42:11,365 --> 00:42:12,784
DOUBLE LIFE (TITLE)

385
00:42:12,867 --> 00:42:15,328
He couldn't have taken a test
to join the NIS.

386
00:42:15,411 --> 00:42:16,537
I don't know.

387
00:42:17,121 --> 00:42:18,414
He's coming, so ask him yourself.

388
00:42:18,998 --> 00:42:21,709
The nameless shadow agent
whom no one has ever seen

389
00:42:22,251 --> 00:42:23,878
-is coming here?
-Yes.

390
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:26,714
How did you contact the shadow?

391
00:42:27,381 --> 00:42:28,674
I texted him.

392
00:42:29,258 --> 00:42:32,345
I'll call him if it's urgent.
If he doesn't answer, I'll go to him.

393
00:42:32,929 --> 00:42:35,014
You're terrible.

394
00:42:35,098 --> 00:42:38,935
The aim of this movie is to show
the real world of secret agents.

395
00:42:39,018 --> 00:42:41,896
What I'm telling you is real.

396
00:42:41,979 --> 00:42:45,483
-Were you really with NIS?
-I was.

397
00:42:45,566 --> 00:42:48,694
I can't pay you for the scenario
consultation if you keep this up.

398
00:42:49,695 --> 00:42:51,572
Why don't you believe me?

399
00:42:52,281 --> 00:42:54,951
Look. See?

400
00:42:55,701 --> 00:42:58,871
He texted me to meet at 3:00 p.m.

401
00:42:59,413 --> 00:43:00,540
Goodness.

402
00:43:00,623 --> 00:43:02,583
-That's him contacting you?
-Yes.

403
00:43:03,167 --> 00:43:05,419
There he is. Over here.

404
00:43:07,922 --> 00:43:12,176
Introduce yourselves. He is Suk-yoo Kwon,
a director who consults scenarios with me.

405
00:43:12,593 --> 00:43:14,679
This is whom I told you about. Mr. K.

406
00:43:15,513 --> 00:43:19,225
Goodness. Mr. K.
I've heard so much about you.

407
00:43:20,351 --> 00:43:22,645
He's a fraud, so watch yourself.

408
00:43:23,855 --> 00:43:27,358
Okay, then. I'll leave now
and let you two talk.

409
00:43:27,859 --> 00:43:29,277
-Why?
-I'm busy.

410
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,280
Mr. Kwon. Hey. Mr. Kwon.

411
00:43:32,864 --> 00:43:34,574
Damn it.

412
00:43:38,035 --> 00:43:39,662
-Can't you please...
-Have a seat.

413
00:43:41,706 --> 00:43:46,752
Hey. He won't believe me
even if I told him the truth anyway.

414
00:43:48,004 --> 00:43:51,215
I can tell him many times.
He'll say I made it up.

415
00:43:52,383 --> 00:43:54,135
-Where's the first wood carving?
-Yes.

416
00:43:57,263 --> 00:43:59,223
The location of the first wood carving

417
00:43:59,307 --> 00:44:02,226
that we found by tracking the container

418
00:44:04,353 --> 00:44:05,229
is in Russia.

419
00:44:10,067 --> 00:44:12,236
The oil tycoon, Chairman Victor.

420
00:44:12,445 --> 00:44:15,281
The arms dealer
Chairman Victor's secret safe.

421
00:44:15,364 --> 00:44:19,535
But he's so strict about security,

422
00:44:20,119 --> 00:44:22,455
that everything's hidden,
including the location of his house.

423
00:44:26,542 --> 00:44:27,668
What?

424
00:44:29,462 --> 00:44:32,882
You're wondering about the plan?
Of course, we have one.

425
00:44:33,758 --> 00:44:36,636
The fan meeting of Korean star,
Un-gwang Yeo.

426
00:44:39,388 --> 00:44:40,514
A fan meeting?

427
00:44:42,099 --> 00:44:43,517
UN-GWANG YEO

428
00:44:45,853 --> 00:44:47,521
UN-GWANG YEO'S PROFILE

429
00:44:47,605 --> 00:44:52,109
"Name, Un-gwang Yeo. Age 43.

430
00:44:54,487 --> 00:44:56,989
Started as a stunt man
and is now an actor.

431
00:44:57,573 --> 00:45:01,118
He debuted in 2011
in A Detective's Enemy."

432
00:45:02,203 --> 00:45:03,579
UN-GWANG YEO'S PROFILE

433
00:45:03,663 --> 00:45:05,456
JONGRO COFFEE, JONGRO BRANCH

434
00:45:07,208 --> 00:45:08,793
"Jongro Coffee, Jongro branch"?

435
00:45:09,627 --> 00:45:10,795
JONGRO COFFEE, CAFE

436
00:45:13,214 --> 00:45:14,924
Is this in English?

437
00:45:15,007 --> 00:45:18,803
He's a foreigner. It's Chairman Victor's
secret birthday party.

438
00:45:18,928 --> 00:45:19,929
Secret, my ass.

439
00:45:20,262 --> 00:45:24,642
What am I supposed to do at an old man's
birthday party? What are you thinking?

440
00:45:25,226 --> 00:45:29,063
He isn't just any old man.
Victor is a chairman.

441
00:45:29,146 --> 00:45:31,440
He's one of Forbes'
top 30 richest men alive.

442
00:45:31,524 --> 00:45:34,318
That's right.
Someone like that is your fan.

443
00:45:34,819 --> 00:45:37,947
If you go and shake his hand a few times
and take a few pictures with him,

444
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:40,616
he's going to invest
in some Hollywood movies.

445
00:45:45,246 --> 00:45:49,417
Then will I be the sole lead
in Dark Death?

446
00:45:50,418 --> 00:45:54,088
Yes, if you go and wish Chairman Victor
a happy birthday.

447
00:46:05,808 --> 00:46:10,187
Come on. If an old man asks for a favor,
of course, I should pay my respects.

448
00:46:10,271 --> 00:46:13,899
I haven't lost my humility.
Every single fan is precious.

449
00:46:13,983 --> 00:46:16,318
Look at this. My goodness.

450
00:46:16,944 --> 00:46:20,906
This is very expensive and precious.
It's so warm.

451
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:23,659
Okay. Then I'll set it up.

452
00:46:24,452 --> 00:46:26,162
-Good boy.
-Yes.

453
00:46:26,245 --> 00:46:27,455
Seriously,

454
00:46:28,289 --> 00:46:31,083
I love how simple you are.

455
00:46:33,044 --> 00:46:34,670
As the lead character in Hollywood...

456
00:46:37,923 --> 00:46:41,135
Of course, you should go.

457
00:46:43,471 --> 00:46:44,388
We'll go with this.

458
00:46:49,643 --> 00:46:51,437
What a nice camera.

459
00:46:51,937 --> 00:46:53,481
I'll only delete Un-gwang's photos.

460
00:46:55,608 --> 00:46:57,526
-Who are you?
-Who are you?

461
00:47:01,822 --> 00:47:04,283
I know every reporter. Whom are you with?

462
00:47:06,494 --> 00:47:11,082
You don't want to say who you are,
but you're working hard taking pictures.

463
00:47:11,665 --> 00:47:13,334
You're a paparazzi, aren't you?

464
00:47:13,793 --> 00:47:17,171
Even if he is a celebrity, you can't take
his pictures like this. That's the law.

465
00:47:20,925 --> 00:47:21,926
What is this?

466
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:27,890
What is this?

467
00:47:32,436 --> 00:47:33,270
You looked pretty.

468
00:47:44,865 --> 00:47:46,992
I'm dumb, so I want to remember.

469
00:47:47,201 --> 00:47:50,412
If I catch you again, I'll press charges.

The youth unemployment issue
certainly is a problem.

476
00:48:20,609 --> 00:48:23,070
Young people are making a living
by being a paparazzi.

477
00:48:23,154 --> 00:48:24,488
So you let him go?

478
00:48:24,572 --> 00:48:27,741
You know I hate the authorities.
What's the point in sending him to jail?

479
00:48:27,825 --> 00:48:31,829
He'll just meet bad people
and become an even worse person.

480
00:48:31,912 --> 00:48:34,957
Hey. With a face like this,
you should've gotten his number

481
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,751
and see how things play out.

482
00:48:38,586 --> 00:48:42,047
Even when a man says, "You looked pretty"
to someone he just met?

483
00:48:42,131 --> 00:48:47,386
Exactly. How many men who look like that
would tell you that you look pretty?

484
00:48:48,596 --> 00:48:49,805
Tell me.

NO IMAGES

486
00:49:15,456 --> 00:49:17,166

Do-ha Cha.

493
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:07,424
What are you doing? Are you working?
I thought you were taking the day off.

494
00:50:07,841 --> 00:50:11,303
Something was nagging at me,
so I was examining the plan.

495
00:50:11,387 --> 00:50:12,304
What was?

496
00:50:13,264 --> 00:50:15,933
-Who's that?
-Un-gwang Yeo's manager.

497
00:50:17,601 --> 00:50:20,145
There's always a beautiful woman
where there's a plan.

498
00:50:20,604 --> 00:50:22,856
-So what's nagging at you?
-Nothing much.

499
00:50:25,526 --> 00:50:26,652
What is all that?

500
00:50:27,861 --> 00:50:32,032
Manual for Going Undercover
and the movies he was in.

501
00:50:39,331 --> 00:50:40,291
He did these too?

502
00:50:40,374 --> 00:50:42,376
WE DID IT IN SECRET

503
00:50:42,459 --> 00:50:43,627
That one is awesome.

504
00:50:54,054 --> 00:50:56,473
Would you like to walk
the Cannes' red carpet?

505
00:50:56,557 --> 00:51:00,978
Cannes' red carpet? Well, let's see.
The movies I liked as a child

506
00:51:01,687 --> 00:51:04,565
had characters who could do
a 540-degree spin kick.

507
00:51:04,648 --> 00:51:08,277
Or they could send the evil villains
straight to hell.

508
00:51:08,569 --> 00:51:10,988
I liked such spectacular
martial arts movies.

509
00:51:11,071 --> 00:51:14,283
Also, shooting a gun from each hand
with a matchstick in his mouth

510
00:51:14,491 --> 00:51:17,828
and giving his life, his youth,
for justice.

511
00:51:18,329 --> 00:51:21,915
Extreme action romance noir!

512
00:51:24,376 --> 00:51:27,254
Those are the kinds of movies I liked.

513
00:51:27,504 --> 00:51:32,801
I see. You seem very excited
when you talk about movies that you like.

514
00:51:36,263 --> 00:51:37,598
Someone said that before.

515
00:51:38,766 --> 00:51:39,850
Pardon?

516
00:51:41,643 --> 00:51:43,228
I must have wanted to prove

517
00:51:44,897 --> 00:51:47,274
that I could become a Hollywood superhero.

518
00:51:48,359 --> 00:51:49,485
Because I...

519
00:51:52,112 --> 00:51:53,238
am an action actor.

520
00:51:58,577 --> 00:52:00,704
I see. Thank you.

521
00:52:00,788 --> 00:52:03,957
Your passion for action is incredible.

522
00:52:04,375 --> 00:52:07,628
According to next year's lineup
of Hero Comics movies,

523
00:52:07,711 --> 00:52:11,256
there is a movie in which
Dark Death Scorpion...

524
00:52:33,362 --> 00:52:34,738
Hello, madam.

525
00:52:36,031 --> 00:52:40,327
Should I ring up everything
from here to there?

526
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:44,540
I don't need a lot of clothes.
My body looks better the less I have on.

527
00:52:44,706 --> 00:52:46,250
I see.

528
00:52:47,418 --> 00:52:50,421
You know, right? You're my friend,
but you're quite annoying.

529
00:52:56,844 --> 00:52:59,972
-I haven't seen this before.
-It's this season's main item.

530
00:53:00,722 --> 00:53:05,394
I'm going to make it the main item
in the photo spread with Un-gwang.

531
00:53:05,477 --> 00:53:07,813
A black jacket on Un-gwang.

532
00:53:09,273 --> 00:53:10,858
-You should reconsider.
-Why?

533
00:53:11,525 --> 00:53:14,027
-Don't you think he'll wear it?
-It'll be hard to get him to.

534
00:53:17,197 --> 00:53:21,076
I would like to get fitted
for the evening gown I saw last time.

535
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:22,828
It's been waiting for you
in the fitting room.

536
00:53:23,162 --> 00:53:24,580
Come with me, madam.

537
00:53:37,384 --> 00:53:39,303
I'm sorry I'm late.
I know you're a busy man.

538
00:53:39,386 --> 00:53:43,724
I'm sure you called because it was urgent.
I had a request to make too.

539
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:45,392
Why don't you go first?

540
00:53:55,694 --> 00:53:57,654
-Any pictures of the wood carving?
-None.

541
00:53:58,155 --> 00:53:59,823
Is the information on the secret safe in?

542
00:53:59,907 --> 00:54:01,408
Obviously, I have nothing.

543
00:54:05,537 --> 00:54:07,372
How about the floor plan
of Chairman Victor's house?

544
00:54:12,711 --> 00:54:16,340
You must know where the house is, right?

545
00:54:16,423 --> 00:54:18,884
Agent Yoon was very thorough.

546
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:21,261
He hid it so well
that no one would ever find it.

547
00:54:21,345 --> 00:54:22,179
I'm out.

548
00:54:22,262 --> 00:54:26,475
That's why you need to make sure
his fan meeting works out.

549
00:54:26,558 --> 00:54:29,811
-But look...
-Grab Un-gwang Yeo's hand

550
00:54:31,271 --> 00:54:32,481
and go. That's the only way.

551
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,151
If this falls through, we have no way in.

552
00:54:46,537 --> 00:54:48,580

Tug.

557
00:55:37,838 --> 00:55:38,672
-Done.
-Stop that.

558
00:55:39,881 --> 00:55:40,799
Do I look good?

559
00:55:42,551 --> 00:55:43,385
Let's go.

560
00:55:52,477 --> 00:55:54,146
How does your skin look better with time?

561
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:56,857
I was born this way. What should I wear?

562
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:58,400
-Come with me.
-Sure.

563
00:56:05,949 --> 00:56:07,034
Mr. Jang!

564
00:56:08,368 --> 00:56:09,202
Let's grab a drink.

565
00:56:21,006 --> 00:56:22,716
Maybe I should've stayed with the NIS.

566
00:56:23,383 --> 00:56:26,970
You're looking good,
now that you are a senior manager.

567
00:56:27,638 --> 00:56:31,141
Why do you keep coming?
You should've just stayed then.

568
00:56:31,224 --> 00:56:35,187
I can't. My wife hates hospitals
and the NIS office the most.

569
00:56:35,270 --> 00:56:37,481
Everyone thinks you retired
and became a prosecutor.

570
00:56:37,564 --> 00:56:39,024
It's suspicious if you keep coming.

571
00:56:39,358 --> 00:56:41,985
This is the safest place.
They can't bug this place either.

572
00:56:43,862 --> 00:56:47,407
Did you find anyone on the list I gave you
that seemed suspicious?

573
00:56:49,201 --> 00:56:51,370
Here. Take a look.

574
00:56:52,621 --> 00:56:55,999
I looked as much as I could
through my prosecutor connections,

575
00:56:56,583 --> 00:56:58,877
but none of them killed Agent Yoon.

576
00:57:01,213 --> 00:57:06,259
We'll have to find Songsan's chairman's
ledger that he hid and look at the names.

577
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:09,471
By the way, I took care of what you asked.

578
00:57:09,554 --> 00:57:12,849
Okay. Then we'll proceed
with the fan meeting as planned.

579
00:57:14,893 --> 00:57:16,019
My money.

580
00:57:17,312 --> 00:57:20,482
I'll pay you back double the amount
if there's a problem, so don't worry.

581
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:24,695
Look. There is definitely a hole. But...

582
00:57:30,575 --> 00:57:32,285
-Awesome.
-It's fine, right?

583
00:57:32,369 --> 00:57:34,162
-Incredible.
-That's a real pen.

584
00:57:36,581 --> 00:57:38,792
How did he do that?
There was definitely a hole.

585
00:57:38,875 --> 00:57:39,918
I'll try with a coin this time.

586
00:57:49,678 --> 00:57:51,096
It's gone.

587
00:57:54,099 --> 00:57:54,933
It's back.

588
00:57:57,436 --> 00:57:58,729
It's gone again.

589
00:57:59,896 --> 00:58:01,273
Over here.

590
00:58:05,068 --> 00:58:06,945
-What happened?
-My bad.

591
00:58:10,866 --> 00:58:13,118
-You're so cute.
-Right?

592
00:58:13,785 --> 00:58:16,830
You're definitely not a magician.
You're so super cool.

593
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:21,626
Isn't that the paparazzi?

594
00:58:24,421 --> 00:58:25,964
-What is this?
-You looked pretty.

595
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:29,843
He's so persistent.
Did you really come all the way here?

596
00:58:30,427 --> 00:58:31,720
I practiced that so much.

597
00:58:35,182 --> 00:58:36,183
That's so cool.

598
00:58:37,184 --> 00:58:39,227
What's his deal? What is he doing?

599
00:58:41,396 --> 00:58:43,565
Maybe it's a fake bill.

600
00:58:50,405 --> 00:58:51,615
What the...

601
00:58:51,865 --> 00:58:53,033
No, it's real.

602
00:58:55,035 --> 00:58:56,453
Is he a pickpocket?

603
00:58:57,621 --> 00:58:58,622
Why that...

604
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:02,834
-Amazing. So cool.
-I know.

605
00:59:03,168 --> 00:59:06,088
Hey. Where did that pale,

606
00:59:06,379 --> 00:59:08,381
whatever-looking man go to?

607
00:59:08,465 --> 00:59:10,383
-Did you see him too?
-Isn't he so dreamy?

608
00:59:10,967 --> 00:59:12,719
Isn't he breathtakingly gorgeous?

609
00:59:12,803 --> 00:59:14,179
What the hell?

610
00:59:15,305 --> 00:59:16,431
-He's so cool.
-He's so cool.

611
00:59:16,515 --> 00:59:17,724
Seriously.

612
00:59:18,308 --> 00:59:22,687
That looks great on you.
The bright color looks good.

613
00:59:22,771 --> 00:59:27,442
Red is my color. You never have to worry
about what color to dress me in.

614
00:59:27,692 --> 00:59:30,946
A strong red is always the answer
for Mr. Yeo.

615
00:59:33,991 --> 00:59:36,786
Right? It looks good to you too, right?

616
00:59:36,869 --> 00:59:38,371
Why is that woman here?

617
00:59:38,663 --> 00:59:40,331
Me? I'm the client.

618
00:59:41,165 --> 00:59:43,751
Songsan took over this brand.

619
00:59:44,502 --> 00:59:46,421
You look good in red as always.

620
00:59:47,172 --> 00:59:50,383
-I won't wear this. I refuse!
-Sweetie, that's not it.

621
00:59:50,467 --> 00:59:52,302
Switch the main item
or I won't do the shoot.

622
00:59:52,385 --> 00:59:53,261
Should I just leave?

623
00:59:53,345 --> 00:59:54,679
I'll pay the penalty. How much is it?

624
01:00:07,108 --> 01:00:10,153
Good. Okay.

625
01:00:11,237 --> 01:00:12,697
Good.

626
01:00:14,324 --> 01:00:15,909
Bravo. Looking great.

627
01:00:18,244 --> 01:00:20,038
It was exactly as you said.

628
01:00:20,121 --> 01:00:22,540
I wondered what you meant
about dressing him in red first,

629
01:00:22,624 --> 01:00:23,833
if I wanted him to wear black.

630
01:00:23,917 --> 01:00:27,504
He'll probably never wear red ever again.

631
01:00:47,148 --> 01:00:47,982
Hey!

632
01:00:48,066 --> 01:00:49,025
Are you okay?

633
01:00:49,109 --> 01:00:50,485
Yes.

634
01:00:51,403 --> 01:00:52,987
-Okay, then.
-Okay.

635
01:00:58,576 --> 01:01:00,620
I've got you. I saw everything.

636
01:01:01,955 --> 01:01:03,039
Well, well.

637
01:01:03,957 --> 01:01:05,792
See? Look at this.

638
01:01:05,875 --> 01:01:07,210
My wallet.

639
01:01:09,129 --> 01:01:10,046
What's going on?

640
01:01:10,130 --> 01:01:12,507
You were a paparazzi last time
and now you're a pickpocket?

641
01:01:13,425 --> 01:01:17,011
-Jung-hye, call the guards.
-Okay.

642
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:23,852
What's going on?

643
01:01:24,352 --> 01:01:28,064
He stole our staff's wallet.

644
01:01:28,148 --> 01:01:29,482
He's a pickpocket.

645
01:01:30,316 --> 01:01:32,360
That's not all.
Earlier, I saw him taking this.

646
01:01:33,737 --> 01:01:35,572
Yes, this.

647
01:01:36,197 --> 01:01:39,701
This is an entry card
he stole from our stylist.

648
01:01:42,954 --> 01:01:46,332
Also, this passport,
he stole from Mr. Yang.

649
01:01:47,041 --> 01:01:50,378
Let's see. Everything is in here.

650
01:01:52,714 --> 01:01:54,382
This passport belongs to Un-gwang?

651
01:01:58,762 --> 01:01:59,679
Who are you?

652
01:02:05,185 --> 01:02:06,519
Are you his fanboy?

653
01:02:12,484 --> 01:02:15,570
Ms. Cha! What are you doing?
Take your hands off of him!

654
01:02:20,492 --> 01:02:23,119
Sir, he stole Un-gwang's... It hurts!

655
01:02:35,757 --> 01:02:36,925
Let me go.

656
01:02:39,594 --> 01:02:40,929
Let me go.

657
01:02:42,847 --> 01:02:43,723
Hey.

658
01:02:44,557 --> 01:02:45,683
Let...

659
01:03:15,046 --> 01:03:15,922
Damn it.

660
01:03:19,634 --> 01:03:23,012
As you had guessed,
Mr. Yeo's security is terrible.

661
01:03:24,055 --> 01:03:26,015
Yes, well...

662
01:03:33,231 --> 01:03:36,234
I am your head of security as of today.

663
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:46,870
Okay.

664
01:04:20,361 --> 01:04:23,197
He's the type that Un-gwang hates.

665
01:04:23,323 --> 01:04:27,702
When the VIP is about to be late,
his bodyguard should take care of it.

666
01:04:27,785 --> 01:04:32,290
A bodyguard's top priorities
are the VIP's life and safety.

667
01:04:33,041 --> 01:04:35,126
What kind of a bodyguard makes a bomb?

668
01:04:35,209 --> 01:04:37,795
I'll die and disappear
once this mission is completed anyway.

669
01:04:37,879 --> 01:04:39,213
He acts strange.

670
01:04:39,297 --> 01:04:41,883
What did you misunderstand?
"You looked pretty"?

671
01:04:41,966 --> 01:04:42,926
What he says is strange.

672
01:04:43,551 --> 01:04:44,844
I've got you.

673
01:04:44,928 --> 01:04:46,262
Fire him. Right away.

674
01:04:47,013 --> 01:04:49,182
You're fired.

675
01:04:52,727 --> 01:04:54,479
