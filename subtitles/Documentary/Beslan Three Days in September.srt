If you were smart,

you would stop talking right now.

Sue me. I just know that women
should never work for women.

How can you say that?

14
00:01:51,808 --> 00:01:54,144
Because they're always threatened.

beautiful, and they're not.

anything of the sort.

Exactly.

29
00:02:21,654 --> 00:02:24,942
Women should work under men,
men under women. That's it.

30
00:02:24,942 --> 00:02:26,543
What about men under men?

That's fine, too. I mean,
they can deal with it.

Women can do amazing

35

She's got a point, bro, you know.

39
00:02:42,292 --> 00:02:44,778
I'd much rather work
under you than her.

40
00:02:44,778 --> 00:02:48,114
That's nice. I'd rather
work under him, too.

41
00:02:49,534 --> 00:02:51,735
You'd rather "work" under John?

42

You have a problem with that, too?

43
00:02:53,553 --> 00:02:56,373
No. Why would I have a problem
with your little sexual innuendo?

44
00:02:56,373 --> 00:02:58,107
What is up your ass tonight?

45
00:02:58,107 --> 00:02:59,993
So I should just sit
here while you come on

46
00:02:59,993 --> 00:03:01,912
to my husband right in front of me?

47
00:03:01,912 --> 00:03:05,649
Lara, if I wanted your husband,
I would have him, like that.

48
00:03:05,649 --> 00:03:07,968
How? You couldn't possibly
show him more of those tits.

49
00:03:07,968 --> 00:03:09,702
You know what your problem is? Okay...

50
00:03:09,702 --> 00:03:12,039
My problem is your brain
is as big as those tits.

51
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:13,506
Huge, exactly.
Baby, this is your fault.

52
00:03:13,506 --> 00:03:15,575
This is your...

53
00:03:15,575 --> 00:03:16,843
If you had half a brain, we
wouldn't be having this conversation.

54
00:03:16,843 --> 00:03:18,845
MICK: Baby. Let it go,
let it go, let it go.

55
00:03:18,845 --> 00:03:20,180
Good night, brother dear.

56
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,481
Good night.

57
00:03:21,481 --> 00:03:22,916
She's completely full of herself.

58
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,484
Don't try and agree with me now.

59
00:03:24,484 --> 00:03:26,153
I don't even think she's a
member of the dental profession.

60
00:03:26,153 --> 00:03:27,587
Shut up.

61
00:03:27,587 --> 00:03:30,490
She probably can't even
spell "anesthesiologist."

62
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,192
The woman's a complete fraud.

63
00:03:32,192 --> 00:03:33,827
We went to her office party, you idiot.

64
00:03:33,827 --> 00:03:36,163
And I believe she hit
on me that night as well.

65
00:03:36,163 --> 00:03:38,698
You are completely delusional. She
didn't even hit on you in there.

66
00:03:38,698 --> 00:03:40,167
I just don't like her.

67
00:03:40,167 --> 00:03:43,303
I understand your point of view.
I really do. I agree with you.

68
00:03:43,303 --> 00:03:45,205
Somebody who looks like
that should not be allowed

69
00:03:45,205 --> 00:03:47,074
anywhere near oral surgery.

70
00:03:47,074 --> 00:03:49,276
You are an asshole.

71
00:03:49,276 --> 00:03:52,712
You're sitting in the chair,
you're trying to stay calm,

72
00:03:52,712 --> 00:03:55,982
and you got them things
hanging in your face...

74
00:04:25,763 --> 00:04:27,864
So, see you next weekend. All right?

75
00:04:27,864 --> 00:04:28,999
Okay.

76
00:04:28,999 --> 00:04:30,066
Thank you.

77
00:04:30,066 --> 00:04:31,134

82
00:04:53,574 --> 00:04:55,008
Now you say go.

83
00:04:55,977 --> 00:04:56,960
Go.

84
00:04:58,312 --> 00:04:59,296
Smash.

85
00:04:59,296 --> 00:05:01,114
All right, squeeze in.

86
00:05:01,114 --> 00:05:03,616
You know, you can't do this every
morning. It's way too corny.

87

Come on. Smile.

88

Oh, great.
What's that?

91
00:05:13,577 --> 00:05:17,080
You hate brushing your teeth and
that brushes them in 30 seconds.

92
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,583
I love brushing my teeth. Don't
believe everything your mother says.

93
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:21,667

94
00:05:21,667 --> 00:05:23,336
3:00.

95
00:05:23,336 --> 00:05:25,338
But I got some papers to
grade. Can you pick up Luke?

96
00:05:25,338 --> 00:05:28,908
After yesterday, I probably
don't have a job anyway, so...

97
00:05:28,908 --> 00:05:32,195
Was it wrong of me
to call her a useless cow?

98
00:05:32,195 --> 00:05:35,665
I think bosses admire
that kind of frank exchange.

99
00:05:35,665 --> 00:05:36,866
Did you call your dad?

100
00:05:36,866 --> 00:05:38,017
When?

101
00:05:38,635 --> 00:05:40,587
Birthday, yesterday.

102
00:05:40,587 --> 00:05:44,057
Yeah, I sent him some freshly
cut flowers, little pink roses.

103
00:05:44,057 --> 00:05:45,792
I sent him a handmade card.

104
00:05:45,792 --> 00:05:48,745
And I finished that quilt
I have been sewing since spring.

105

You are completely impossible.

106
00:05:50,881 --> 00:05:54,434
Did you notice what I got for my
birthday this year? I got a grunt.

107
00:05:54,434 --> 00:05:57,721
Mom said, "Happy birthday, sweetheart,"
and Dad went... (GRUNTS)

108
00:05:57,721 --> 00:06:00,557
It was just... It was a beautiful
moment in my life. I teared up.

109
00:06:00,557 --> 00:06:04,227
Ever think that somebody has
to be the bigger person here?

110
00:06:04,227 --> 00:06:06,913
Now I want you to remember
this for the custody hearing,

111
00:06:06,913 --> 00:06:09,082
how Mommy is always
scolding Daddy, okay?

112
00:06:09,082 --> 00:06:10,166
Can you remember that?

113
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:11,918
You know, how are you going to feel

114
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:14,053
when Luke grows up and doesn't
call you on your birthday?

115
00:06:14,053 --> 00:06:16,006
And now she's trying to
drive a wedge between us.

116
00:06:16,006 --> 00:06:17,273
I give up.

117
00:06:17,273 --> 00:06:18,742
And now she's abandoning you.

118
00:06:22,713 --> 00:06:26,282
Hey, buddy, do you want to try
and knock him over again?

119
00:06:27,317 --> 00:06:29,669
You ready? Line it up.

120
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:33,256

00:23:10,954 --> 00:23:15,508
Could it be about the triumph of
irrationality and the power that's in that?

327
00:23:15,508 --> 00:23:18,677
You know, we spend a lot of time
trying to organize the world.

328
00:23:18,677 --> 00:23:22,848
We build clocks and calendars and
we try and predict the weather.

329
00:23:25,035 --> 00:23:29,388
But what part of our life
is truly under our control?

330
00:23:44,454 --> 00:23:47,188
What if we choose to exist purely

331
00:23:47,188 --> 00:23:49,391
in a reality of our own making?

332
00:23:52,278 --> 00:23:53,846
Does that render us insane?

333
00:24:01,004 --> 00:24:03,923
And if it does, isn't that
better than a life of despair?

334
00:24:14,384 --> 00:24:17,987
It's a course that investigates
what drives men to be free,

335
00:24:17,987 --> 00:24:20,356
no matter the cost.

336
00:24:20,356 --> 00:24:23,258
Some other teacher had dibs on Papillon?

337
00:24:24,711 --> 00:24:28,246
You escaped from jail seven times.

338
00:24:29,482 --> 00:24:31,283
What do you want to know?

339
00:24:31,283 --> 00:24:33,752
How you escaped
when no one else could.

340
00:24:33,752 --> 00:24:36,872
Balls and a little luck.

341
00:24:36,872 --> 00:24:38,540
No prison in the world is airtight.

342
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:41,359
Each one has a key.
You just have to find it.

343
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:42,828
How do you do that?

344
00:24:43,997 --> 00:24:45,964
A lot of looking.

345
00:24:45,964 --> 00:24:49,051
Especially at things that
break up the daily routine.

346
00:24:49,051 --> 00:24:52,570
Guards get comfortable doing
the same thing day in, day out.

347
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:55,273
Something happens, that's
when they make mistakes.

348
00:24:55,273 --> 00:24:58,143
When you see it,
you have to be ready.

349
00:24:58,143 --> 00:25:00,646
You have to have the entire
plan already in place,

350
00:25:00,646 --> 00:25:03,616
even before you know how
you're going to get out of jail.

351
00:25:03,616 --> 00:25:07,620
Escaping is easy, the
hardest part is staying free.

352
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,704
You have to know
where you're going to go

353
00:25:09,704 --> 00:25:11,857
and how you're going to get there.

354
00:25:11,857 --> 00:25:16,228
You have to know how they plan
to catch you, where and when.

355
00:25:16,228 --> 00:25:18,596
Well, how the hell are
you supposed to know that?

356
00:25:18,596 --> 00:25:20,666
You pay off someone who knows.

357
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:23,585
And a lot depends on if the prison
is in the country or the city.

358
00:25:23,585 --> 00:25:24,770
City.

359
00:25:36,649 --> 00:25:38,116
Where are you from?

360
00:25:39,385 --> 00:25:40,819
Pittsburgh.

361
00:25:40,819 --> 00:25:42,004
(LAUGHS)

362
00:25:44,707 --> 00:25:46,825
Pittsburgh's tough.

363
00:25:46,825 --> 00:25:50,729
DAMON: So many bridges and
tunnels they can block off.

364
00:25:50,729 --> 00:25:53,064
From the time they make the call,

365
00:25:53,064 --> 00:25:56,601
the police can have the center of
the city sealed tight in 15 minutes.

366
00:25:56,601 --> 00:25:58,520
How can they be so exact?

367
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,357
After 9/11, Homeland Security made
every city have a lockdown plan.

368
00:26:02,357 --> 00:26:06,662
Downtown Pittsburgh, Philly,
Boston, Minneapolis, 15 minutes.

369
00:26:06,662 --> 00:26:08,730
They can do D.C. in under 10.

370
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:10,665
Within 35 minutes, they can have cops

371
00:26:10,665 --> 00:26:12,801
at every tollbooth on the interstate

372
00:26:12,801 --> 00:26:15,720
and be running rolling stops
on the secondary roads.

373
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,072
They won't have your photograph yet,

374
00:26:17,072 --> 00:26:19,925
but they will have your description.

375
00:26:19,925 --> 00:26:22,594
What if you can't get out? Thirty-five
minutes is not a lot of time.

376
00:26:22,594 --> 00:26:24,463
Then surrender.

377
00:26:24,463 --> 00:26:28,683
Because they will shoot you on sight,
along with anyone else you're with.

378
00:26:28,683 --> 00:26:31,403
Stay far away from the
train and bus stations.

379
00:26:31,403 --> 00:26:34,806
Forget the local airports.
Leave from another state.

380
00:26:34,806 --> 00:26:37,842
Second, identity.
It's easy to find fake papers,

381
00:26:37,842 --> 00:26:40,662
harder to find ones that will
get you through an airport.

382
00:26:40,662 --> 00:26:45,134
You will need a passport, a driver's
license and a social security number.

383
00:26:45,134 --> 00:26:48,887
If you have to rent a car, find a
place that will take a cash deposit.

384
00:26:48,887 --> 00:26:51,056
They will still run a credit check,

385
00:26:51,056 --> 00:26:53,224
so use a real person's name on the ID.

386
00:26:53,224 --> 00:26:55,110
Third, destination.

387
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:58,197
You want somewhere that doesn't
attract American tourists.

388
00:26:58,197 --> 00:27:01,233
Think Yemen, and you get the idea.

389
00:27:01,233 --> 00:27:04,202
And money, you will
need a truckload of it.

390
00:27:04,202 --> 00:27:07,723
Everything's expensive,
hotels, travel, information.

391
00:27:08,441 --> 00:27:09,491
How much?

392
00:27:09,491 --> 00:27:12,010
Enough to last at least five, 
six years.

393
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:15,213
You run out of money,
you run out of friends.

394
00:27:17,116 --> 00:27:23,488
But before you do anything, you have
to ask yourself if you can do it.

395
00:27:23,488 --> 00:27:26,291
Can you forget about ever
seeing your parents again?

396
00:27:26,291 --> 00:27:30,379
Can you kill a guard? 
Leave your kid at a gas station?

397
00:27:30,379 --> 00:27:32,497
Push some nice
old lady to the ground

398
00:27:32,497 --> 00:27:34,550
just because she gets
between you and the door?

399
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:38,387
Because to do this thing,
that's who you have to become.

400
00:27:39,939 --> 00:27:42,324
And if you can't, don't start,

401
00:27:43,409 --> 00:27:46,210
because you will just 
get someone killed.

402
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:49,047
How did you get caught?

403
00:27:52,284 --> 00:27:54,018
I gave myself up.

404
00:27:55,555 --> 00:27:57,889
I couldn't take wondering when someone

405
00:27:57,889 --> 00:28:00,375
was going to come through
the bedroom door.

406
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,481
So, what do you have in your pocket?

407
00:28:22,899 --> 00:28:24,033
Good luck.

now the largest jail in the world.

418
00:29:57,692 --> 00:29:59,394
There have been three escape attempts

419
00:29:59,394 --> 00:30:00,963

544
00:43:37,429 --> 00:43:39,129
Hey, Mr. Brennan.

545
00:43:43,369 --> 00:43:47,204
MAN IN VIDEO: Today I am going to show you
how to make a key that can open any lock.

546
00:43:47,204 --> 00:43:49,257
It's called a bump key.

547
00:43:49,257 --> 00:43:51,375
First thing you need to do
is you need to find a key

548
00:43:51,375 --> 00:43:54,278
that can fit into the type of
lock that you're trying to open.

549
00:43:54,278 --> 00:43:56,514
Here I have a key that
fits into my front door,

550
00:43:56,514 --> 00:44:00,451
but I just changed the locks,
so it won't open.

551
00:44:00,451 --> 00:44:03,170
First thing you need to do
is secure your key,

552
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:05,172
take a metal file and go through

553
00:44:05,172 --> 00:44:07,741
and start taking those
mountains and valleys

554
00:44:07,741 --> 00:44:10,411
all the way down to the lowest
possible setting on the key.

555
00:44:10,411 --> 00:44:13,063
The bump key works by momentarily
bumping those pins up,

556
00:44:13,063 --> 00:44:15,099
so that for a split second,

557
00:44:15,099 --> 00:44:19,320
the chamber is cleared of pins
and thus, able to turn and open.

558
00:45:18,997 --> 00:45:19,930
Here you go.

559
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:21,348
Don't touch that.

560
00:45:21,348 --> 00:45:22,716

You want to tell me what's going on?

574

You want me to tell you?

what's going to happen to your kids

end up in prison.

No, she's not like that.

01:14:57,273 --> 01:15:00,442
No, but someone left through
the back door bleeding.

814

Zone Three found a gunshot
victim dead on a transit bench.

Hey.

I have just come to pick up Luke.

817
01:15:55,464 --> 01:15:57,083
He's sound asleep.

818
01:15:59,786 --> 01:16:02,337
Yeah, I have just come to get Luke.

819
01:16:07,077 --> 01:16:08,077
John.

820
01:16:11,347 --> 01:16:13,082
Are you all right?

821
01:16:13,783 --> 01:16:15,334
Yeah. I am fine.

822
01:16:25,995 --> 01:16:27,680
Hey, buddy.

823
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:30,165
Wake up, bud, we're going home.

(KETTLE WHISTLING)

825
01:17:33,430 --> 01:17:34,830
So, what do you say?

826
01:17:35,665 --> 01:17:37,700
Thank you, Grandma.

827
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:39,468
I think you should give
Grandma a big kiss.

828
01:17:39,468 --> 01:17:40,636
I am too tired for kisses.

829
01:17:40,636 --> 01:17:42,404
Buddy.

830
01:17:42,404 --> 01:17:46,008
That's okay. I will get lots
of kisses next weekend.

831
01:17:46,008 --> 01:17:48,443
We want to take him to the
Fall Festival in Kutztown

832
01:17:48,443 --> 01:17:50,529

See you.
Bye.

Bye.

Bye.

841
01:19:02,819 --> 01:19:04,536
You're getting sentimental
in your old age.

842
01:19:04,536 --> 01:19:05,754
Ha.

843
01:19:05,754 --> 01:19:07,038
Yeah.

844
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:11,910
Well, might as well have some coffee.

Yo. Idiots.

847
01:19:41,574 --> 01:19:43,642
Can I carry him?

848
01:19:43,642 --> 01:19:46,528
No, bud. Only what fits
in the bag, all right?

849
01:19:52,235 --> 01:19:54,120
What about my pockets?

850
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:55,821
Or your pockets.

851
01:21:24,527 --> 01:21:25,594
Hello?

852
01:21:28,364 --> 01:21:29,598

Okay.

Hey, bud.

856
01:22:34,714 --> 01:22:36,131
So...

You all right?

858
01:22:39,385 --> 01:22:40,568
Yeah.

I know where that is.

Okay? Here we go.

863

Yeah, taillight matches
any 2004 to 2009 Prius.

864

What kind of criminal drives a Prius?

865
01:23:17,189 --> 01:23:18,957
A socially responsible one.

866

There's over 1,000 registered
in the city, 7,000 in the state.

867
01:23:22,778 --> 01:23:24,429
How many are registered to felons?

HARRIS: 
Six in the state.

Four to embezzlers,
white-collar criminals,

870
01:23:28,199 --> 01:23:30,368
one to a rapist,
one to a murderer.

871
01:23:30,368 --> 01:23:31,837
Start with the murderer.

872
01:23:31,837 --> 01:23:33,705
She's in prison for life.

873

Good to see you.

878
01:23:51,673 --> 01:23:52,841
It's good to see you, too.

879
01:23:56,846 --> 01:23:58,112
Hi, Luke.

880
01:23:58,112 --> 01:24:00,214
It's a pony.

881
01:24:00,214 --> 01:24:02,383
Those aren't easy to wrap.

882
01:24:05,038 --> 01:24:07,272
You know the party is
not until 11:00, right?

883
01:24:07,272 --> 01:24:09,007
Really?

884
01:24:09,007 --> 01:24:11,176
What is it? Around 9:00? I am sorry.

885
01:24:11,176 --> 01:24:13,445
I should have read it more carefully.

886
01:24:13,445 --> 01:24:16,915
It's no problem. Why don't you go 
give this to Carrie?

887
01:24:20,653 --> 01:24:21,953
Well, I guess you can help.

888
01:24:21,953 --> 01:24:24,088
Actually, I have got to go
and run some errands.

889
01:24:25,157 --> 01:24:26,157
Sorry.

890
01:24:29,529 --> 01:24:30,829
We will see you later then.

891
01:24:32,232 --> 01:24:33,832
Thanks so much.

No problem.

897

The rapist is in a wheelchair.

898
01:25:03,912 --> 01:25:05,514
Not sure if that was
karma or just bad luck.

899
01:25:05,514 --> 01:25:07,866
The murderer. 
Where is she incarcerated?

900
01:25:07,866 --> 01:25:09,651
County, right here in town.

901
01:25:09,651 --> 01:25:12,871
Does she have a husband or
a kid old enough to drive?

902
01:25:27,020 --> 01:25:28,921
Yes? What?

No. Get an ambulance.

910
01:25:53,828 --> 01:25:57,249
Take her to University Hospital. 
I will meet them there.

911
01:25:58,885 --> 01:26:01,720
Right. Thanks.

You want to get a warrant?

Yeah.

916
01:27:45,992 --> 01:27:47,442
Get the warrant.

Right now?
Right now.

Have them call the escort vehicle.

979
01:31:53,205 --> 01:31:54,239
Come on.

980
01:31:57,476 --> 01:31:59,127
It's okay.
You stay here.

981
01:31:59,127 --> 01:32:00,178
GUARD: 
All security personnel...

982
01:32:12,675 --> 01:32:14,509
Watch the door.
Yeah.

983
01:32:48,344 --> 01:32:49,510
Stop.

984
01:32:50,346 --> 01:32:51,546
Shit.

985
01:32:52,414 --> 01:32:53,548
Who's in the lobby?

986
01:32:56,885 --> 01:32:59,354
Hey, listen. 
Is anybody in the lobby?

987
01:33:15,321 --> 01:33:16,788
Don't look.

988
01:33:19,274 --> 01:33:20,307
Run.

989
01:33:22,511 --> 01:33:23,544
GUARD: 
Great.

990
01:33:23,544 --> 01:33:24,712
Back here.

991
01:33:30,019 --> 01:33:31,052
Move.

992
01:33:34,590 --> 01:33:36,357
Let's get moving.

993
01:33:40,228 --> 01:33:41,529
Come on.

994
01:33:43,165 --> 01:33:44,398
(HORN HONKING)

995
01:33:45,634 --> 01:33:46,901
(HORN HONKING)

996
01:33:47,770 --> 01:33:48,970
Here.

997
01:34:04,403 --> 01:34:05,703
Hey, hey.

998
01:34:11,660 --> 01:34:12,877
MAN: 
Go Penguins.

999
01:34:12,877 --> 01:34:14,712
Let your hair down.

1000
01:34:23,189 --> 01:34:25,506
Harris, that way. Go.

1001
01:34:41,056 --> 01:34:42,189
Hey.

1002
01:34:58,190 --> 01:35:01,275
Harris, they're in the subway.
Harris. The subway.

1003
01:35:01,275 --> 01:35:02,243
Got it.

1004
01:35:14,790 --> 01:35:15,823
NABULSI: 
They're on the platform.

1005
01:35:15,823 --> 01:35:17,458
Block stations in either directions.

1006
01:35:17,458 --> 01:35:19,961
Call the Port Authority.
Stop all the trains.

1007
01:35:35,110 --> 01:35:36,677
Wait, wait, wait.

1008
01:35:37,646 --> 01:35:39,380
What are we doing?

1009
01:35:42,717 --> 01:35:45,536
ANNOUNCER: Stand clear of
the closing doors, please.

1010
01:35:48,873 --> 01:35:52,259
Move. Pittsburgh PD.

1011
01:35:52,259 --> 01:35:56,130
The train on track four, I want
it stopped. Stop that train.

1012
01:36:09,144 --> 01:36:11,245
CONDUCTOR: 
Next stop...

1013
01:36:16,501 --> 01:36:17,802
(PHONE RINGING)

1014
01:36:47,232 --> 01:36:48,333
Hold on to me.

1015
01:36:48,333 --> 01:36:50,068
Hey, kid, two hands.

1016
01:37:03,398 --> 01:37:04,766
No. No.

1017
01:37:13,526 --> 01:37:14,526
This way.

1018
01:37:16,629 --> 01:37:17,662
There.

1019
01:38:03,042 --> 01:38:04,208
LARA: Red light.
Hold on.

1020
01:38:04,543 --> 01:38:05,810
Red light.

1021
01:38:30,135 --> 01:38:32,786
Ring the city. 
Close bus and train stations.

1022
01:38:32,786 --> 01:38:34,956
And get their description
to the state police.

1023
01:38:34,956 --> 01:38:36,357
WOMAN: 
Copy that.

1024
01:38:36,357 --> 01:38:37,157
How old is their damn kid?

1025
01:38:37,157 --> 01:38:38,842
Six.

1026
01:38:38,842 --> 01:38:40,811
Find out where he is.

1027
01:38:45,818 --> 01:38:46,984
Why didn't you tell me?

1028
01:38:46,984 --> 01:38:47,968
You would have stopped me.

1029
01:38:49,337 --> 01:38:51,271
Your insulin is in here.

1030
01:38:51,271 --> 01:38:53,874
There's a case in here. It's got
a brush, moisturizer, makeup.

1031
01:38:54,093 --> 01:38:56,794
Everything you had was old.
I hope I got it right.

1032
01:39:06,755 --> 01:39:09,073
You remember where you last saw him?

1033
01:39:09,073 --> 01:39:12,143
You want to take a guess
who just escaped from jail?

1034
01:39:12,143 --> 01:39:13,277
Hold on a second.

1035
01:39:19,084 --> 01:39:20,117
Hello.

1036
01:39:20,117 --> 01:39:21,718
- Hi. 
- I am here to pick up my son.

1037
01:39:21,718 --> 01:39:23,220
They aren't back yet.

1038
01:39:24,606 --> 01:39:26,240
Back from where?

1039
01:39:26,240 --> 01:39:27,758
From the zoo.

1040
01:39:30,929 --> 01:39:32,296
It's a zoo party.

1041
01:39:33,782 --> 01:39:36,767
They should be back in about
an hour if you'd like to wait.

1042
01:39:36,767 --> 01:39:38,452
No. Thank you.

1043
01:39:42,875 --> 01:39:44,959
What's wrong?
What is it?

1044
01:39:46,128 --> 01:39:47,361
Where is he?
Where's Luke?

1045
01:39:47,361 --> 01:39:49,029
He's at the party.

1046
01:39:49,029 --> 01:39:50,764
What party? 
You said the party was here.

1047
01:39:50,764 --> 01:39:53,434
I was wrong. 
She's taken them to the zoo.

1048
01:39:55,888 --> 01:39:57,522
GPS: Destination, Pittsburgh Zoo.

1049
01:39:57,522 --> 01:39:58,856
She?

1050
01:39:58,856 --> 01:40:02,726
Estimated drive time, 17 minutes.

1051
01:40:02,726 --> 01:40:04,678
Carrie's mother, Nicole.

1052
01:40:08,700 --> 01:40:10,801
(BE THE ONE PLAYING)

1053
01:40:26,051 --> 01:40:27,351
Check the neighbors.

1054
01:40:27,351 --> 01:40:28,686
We're looking for
the boy and anything

1055
01:40:28,686 --> 01:40:30,321
they have noticed in the last few days.

1056
01:41:38,306 --> 01:41:41,458
GPS: Time to destination, 11 minutes.

1057
01:41:48,317 --> 01:41:51,435
In 1,000 feet, bear left.

1058
01:41:57,659 --> 01:42:01,178
In 500 feet, bear left.

1059
01:42:07,669 --> 01:42:10,705
In 100 feet, bear left.

1060
01:42:14,576 --> 01:42:15,976
Bear left.

1061
01:42:23,952 --> 01:42:26,087
You took the wrong turn.

1062
01:42:26,087 --> 01:42:28,205
John, the zoo's behind us.
You took the wrong turn.

1063
01:42:28,205 --> 01:42:29,056
Babe, what are you doing?

1064
01:42:29,257 --> 01:42:30,775
She will call my parents.

1065
01:42:30,775 --> 01:42:32,260
What?
They will look after him,

1066
01:42:32,260 --> 01:42:34,077
and I will figure out a
way of getting him to us.

1067
01:42:34,077 --> 01:42:35,195
Are you out of your mind?

1068
01:42:35,195 --> 01:42:36,714
I tried. There's no more time.

1069
01:42:36,714 --> 01:42:38,865
Any second now, there's going to
be a roadblock ahead of us.

1070
01:42:38,865 --> 01:42:42,152
It might be there now. If we don't
get out now, we don't get out.

1071
01:42:42,152 --> 01:42:45,639
I will find a way of getting him
to us, all right? I will find a way.

1072
01:46:16,284 --> 01:46:19,486
No, really, it's fine. I just can't
thank you enough for taking care of him.

1073
01:46:19,486 --> 01:46:20,754
Hey, it was our pleasure.

1074
01:46:48,149 --> 01:46:49,283
Hi.

1075
01:47:21,983 --> 01:47:24,517
I am going to sit back here, okay?

1076
01:47:26,371 --> 01:47:27,438
Sure.

1077
01:48:09,330 --> 01:48:11,699
REPORTER: The traffic is
backing up at the toll plazas.

1078
01:48:11,699 --> 01:48:13,166
It's worse downtown where police

1079
01:48:13,166 --> 01:48:14,585
have cordoned off the train station

1080
01:48:14,585 --> 01:48:16,403
and are searching all passengers.

1081
01:48:16,403 --> 01:48:19,356
Joining us from Union Station,
our very own Sylvia Patterson.

1082
01:48:19,356 --> 01:48:20,424
John?

1083
01:48:25,363 --> 01:48:27,280
What are we going to do?

1084
01:48:37,542 --> 01:48:40,010
We're going to the train station.

1085
01:49:22,002 --> 01:49:24,003
Stay in the car.
Okay.

1086
01:50:06,564 --> 01:50:09,432
Sir, I am sorry
the mayor was delayed,

1087
01:50:09,432 --> 01:50:12,302
but I did not tell them
to stop every vehicle.

1088
01:50:12,302 --> 01:50:15,605
Just the ones with
a couple and a child.

1089
01:50:15,605 --> 01:50:17,374
Sir, I know my...

1090
01:50:18,877 --> 01:50:20,244
Yes, sir.

1091
01:50:58,149 --> 01:51:03,687
Are you sure $20 is enough? Ticket
to Buffalo costs three times that.

1092
01:51:03,687 --> 01:51:06,857
Yeah. We're going that way anyway.

1093
01:52:08,068 --> 01:52:09,837
Go wider. 
Send their photos to every train,

1094
01:52:09,837 --> 01:52:12,655
bus station and airport
in a 300-mile radius.

1095
01:52:12,655 --> 01:52:15,692
So Ohio, Maryland, West Virginia,

1096
01:52:15,692 --> 01:52:19,947
New York, New Jersey, Virginia,
Michigan, Kentucky and Indiana?

1097
01:52:19,947 --> 01:52:22,149
You know what direction
they're going in, smart-ass?

1098
01:52:33,177 --> 01:52:34,111
See you again, Tom.

1099
01:52:34,111 --> 01:52:35,245
Thanks again.

1100
01:52:49,711 --> 01:52:51,061
You want to see it?

1101
01:52:51,061 --> 01:52:53,313
Only if it will
tell me where they are.

1102
01:52:53,313 --> 01:52:54,615
Not so lucky.

1103
01:53:15,736 --> 01:53:18,405
Excuse me. Do you call this coffee?

1104
01:53:26,614 --> 01:53:28,681
How many airports in Ontario and Quebec?

1105
01:53:28,917 --> 01:53:30,733
You want me to stop calling and count?

1106
01:53:32,736 --> 01:53:34,171
CLERK: 
Long way to go with just a carry-on.

1107
01:53:34,171 --> 01:53:35,639
I am sorry?

1108
01:53:35,639 --> 01:53:38,007
Long way to go with just a carry-on.

1109
01:53:39,644 --> 01:53:43,880
You know how many times
you guys have lost our bags?

1110
01:53:43,880 --> 01:53:46,716
Here's your tickets and boarding passes.

1111
01:53:47,718 --> 01:53:48,985
Thank you.

1112
01:53:52,123 --> 01:53:53,457
They found the parents.

1113
01:54:17,732 --> 01:54:21,568
You decided to go for a
drive for the entire day?

1114
01:54:21,568 --> 01:54:23,920
George wanted to see the leaves.

1115
01:54:39,320 --> 01:54:42,355
And you have absolutely no
idea where they're going, right?

1116
01:54:42,355 --> 01:54:44,557
I told you.
We never spoke.

1117
01:55:12,470 --> 01:55:13,537
Hey.

1118
01:55:15,989 --> 01:55:17,423
I will do this.

1119
01:55:27,785 --> 01:55:29,152
Go ahead, Luke.

1120
01:55:31,956 --> 01:55:32,956
LARA: 
Hello.

1121
01:55:47,005 --> 01:55:49,355
You look like you need to get away.

1122
01:55:59,950 --> 01:56:01,318
Thank you.

1123
01:56:03,521 --> 01:56:05,121
Come on, buddy.

1124
01:56:35,502 --> 01:56:36,937
Too bad you didn't find more of it.

1125
01:56:36,937 --> 01:56:38,187
Yeah.

1126
01:56:39,523 --> 01:56:42,342
And I wish I could
figure out where this is.

1127
01:56:42,342 --> 01:56:45,529
I checked Web sites for every
tourist destination I could think of.

1128
01:56:46,864 --> 01:56:48,097
That's the Presidential Palace.

1129
01:56:48,097 --> 01:56:49,700
What?

1130
01:56:49,700 --> 01:56:52,569
It was all over CNN when it
collapsed during the earthquake.

1131
01:56:56,190 --> 01:56:57,857
We know where they're going.

1132
01:56:57,857 --> 01:57:00,359
Show me.

1133
01:57:00,359 --> 01:57:03,930
CLERK: Thank you for waiting.
We will soon begin boarding by rows.

1134
01:57:07,501 --> 01:57:10,119
Hold them at the gate. 
Take a look.

1135
01:57:11,422 --> 01:57:12,756
Let's go.

1136
01:57:34,195 --> 01:57:36,930
Excuse me, folks.
No one else on.

1137
01:57:36,930 --> 01:57:40,166
Excuse me, folks. Excuse me. 
Excuse me, please.

1138
01:57:58,352 --> 01:58:01,304
Sorry. There's no one by that
description on this flight.

1139
01:58:01,304 --> 01:58:03,156
No. They're on it.

1140
01:58:03,156 --> 01:58:04,391
Do you have the photographs?

1141
01:58:04,391 --> 01:58:06,743
We have the photographs.
They're not on this plane.

1142
01:58:09,447 --> 01:58:11,648
Are there any other
flights to Haiti tonight?

1143
01:58:11,648 --> 01:58:13,700
Are there any other
flights to Haiti tonight?

1144
01:58:16,053 --> 01:58:17,937
No other flights.
Anything else?

1145
01:58:24,078 --> 01:58:26,679
No. No. Thank you.

1146
01:58:30,551 --> 01:58:31,951
It's starting to rain.

1147
01:58:36,757 --> 01:58:38,491
I will call the FBI.

1148
01:58:45,065 --> 01:58:49,386
You ever ask yourself why we
found this bag and not the others?

1149
01:58:58,462 --> 01:59:00,664
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: The captain has
switched off the seat belt light.

1150
01:59:00,664 --> 01:59:03,166
Flight time to Caracas,
Venezuela, this evening

1151
01:59:03,166 --> 01:59:05,602
is five hours and 32 minutes.

1152
01:59:05,602 --> 01:59:07,470
While in your seat, the captain asks

1153
01:59:07,470 --> 01:59:09,856
that you keep your seat belt fastened.

1154
01:59:16,230 --> 01:59:18,565
This guy's a teacher?

1155
01:59:18,565 --> 01:59:20,567
At a community college.

1156
02:00:42,666 --> 02:00:43,899
(SCREAMS)

1157
02:00:59,066 --> 02:01:00,500
(BUTTON POPPING)

1158
02:01:00,500 --> 02:01:01,801
Hey.

1159
02:03:05,959 --> 02:03:07,293
She heard a button pop.

1160
02:03:07,293 --> 02:03:08,595
COLLERO: 
What?

1161
02:03:14,852 --> 02:03:16,819
She heard a button pop.

1162
02:03:24,595 --> 02:03:27,213
Was it raining when
we searched the scene?

1163
02:03:27,213 --> 02:03:28,631
Three years ago?

1164
02:03:28,631 --> 02:03:30,617
What are we doing here?

1165
02:03:56,761 --> 02:03:59,796
Why don't you act like a cop? 
Grab the other side.

1166
02:03:59,796 --> 02:04:01,230
You're out of your mind.

1167
02:04:03,317 --> 02:04:05,051
Ready?
Yeah.

1168
02:04:08,822 --> 02:04:10,156
You got it?
Mmm-hmm.

1169
02:04:25,172 --> 02:04:27,239
You really thought
you were going to find it?

1170
02:05:41,431 --> 02:05:43,799
(DON'T MAKE A SOUND PLAYING)

1171
02:08:28,882 --> 02:08:31,183
(WALK AROUND THE LAKE PLAYING)
