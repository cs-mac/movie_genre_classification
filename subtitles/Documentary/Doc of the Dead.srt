1
00:00:20,136 --> 00:00:22,305
I don't need to tell
you, Mr. Speaker,

2
00:00:22,338 --> 00:00:25,508
that zombies don't
recognize borders and that

3
00:00:25,542 --> 00:00:29,279
a zombie invasion in the United
States could easily turn into

4
00:00:29,312 --> 00:00:32,449
a continent-wide
pandemic so on behalf of

5
00:00:32,482 --> 00:00:35,385
concerned Canadians everywhere,
Mr. Speaker, I want to ask

6
00:00:35,418 --> 00:00:38,421
the Minister of Foreign Affairs
is he working with

7
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:40,757
his American
counterparts to develop

8
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:44,527
an international zombie strategy
so that a zombie invasion

9
00:00:44,561 --> 00:00:47,964
does not turn into a
zombie apocalypse?

10
00:00:47,997 --> 00:00:52,202
(cheers and applause)

11
00:00:54,037 --> 00:00:59,876
Coming up next on Action
News 7, a dog was found...

12
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:02,579
excuse me just one moment...

13
00:01:02,612 --> 00:01:03,780
I see.

14
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:08,151
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm
receiving a special broadcast

15
00:01:08,184 --> 00:01:11,821
about something
that's happening.

16
00:01:11,855 --> 00:01:16,359
Van Dorn Street is blocked
right now by overturned cars.

17
00:01:16,392 --> 00:01:20,764
We are receiving news that the
bodies of the recently deceased

18
00:01:20,797 --> 00:01:23,099
are returning to life and
attacking the living.

19
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:26,936
Officers are on their way right
now to take you to safety.

20
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,472
...A live reporter out
there on the scene.

21
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:32,575
(screaming)

22
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:36,112
There are millions,
millions of zombies

23
00:01:36,146 --> 00:01:40,517
roaming the earth
chewing people up.

24
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,619
Is that crazy or what?

25
00:01:42,652 --> 00:01:44,154
I suggest you find
the tallest building

26
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,989
in your town and jump off.

27
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:48,358
The zombie outbreak is
no longer an outbreak,

28
00:01:48,391 --> 00:01:51,094
but a full-on pandemic.

29
00:01:51,127 --> 00:01:57,066
Warning you to stay
indoors, to lock your doors,

30
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,538
to arm yourself with any
weapons that are available

31
00:02:01,571 --> 00:02:04,140
and this is America
so you should have plenty.

32
00:02:04,174 --> 00:02:07,277
Grab something heavy,
something that you could hit

33
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:11,881
very hard with, and let's party!

00:03:41,104 --> 00:03:42,906
I'm Jonathan Leonard from
Geekscape and we're going to

53
00:03:42,939 --> 00:03:45,441
find out what the average
person knows about zombies.

54
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:50,313
A zombie is someone who's dead
and came out of the ground

55
00:03:50,346 --> 00:03:54,918
and is bleeding and is gross
looking and they'll kill you.

56
00:03:54,951 --> 00:03:56,219
What do zombies want?

57
00:03:56,252 --> 00:03:57,654
Brains.

58
00:03:57,687 --> 00:03:58,788
What are the
zombie rules?

59
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:03,092
Zombie rules is that you
die, but you don't die.

60
00:04:03,126 --> 00:04:05,762
If you want to be more like
angsty and metaphorical,

61
00:04:05,795 --> 00:04:09,799
a zombie could be someone
trapped in a workday

62
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,402
who lives in a box
and doesn't have fun.

63
00:04:12,435 --> 00:04:14,637
In Chinese tradition
a zombie just jumps.

64
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:19,342
It doesn't talk, it doesn't
walk, it just jumps.

65
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:20,910
What?

66
00:04:20,944 --> 00:04:23,479
Arms out and then it
just hops like that.

67
00:04:29,652 --> 00:04:33,156
The zombie is a relentlessly
aggressive, reanimated

68
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:36,059
human corpse driven by
a biological infection,

69
00:04:36,092 --> 00:04:37,860
so there's kind of
three aspects to that.

70
00:04:37,894 --> 00:04:39,896
You don't negotiate
with a zombie, right?

71
00:04:39,929 --> 00:04:42,465
You can't talk a zombie
out of wanting to eat you.

72
00:04:42,498 --> 00:04:43,566
You can't say, "Hey,
go around the corner,

73
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:45,301
there's a family of five
getting in a Winnebago.

74
00:04:45,335 --> 00:04:48,037
You can eat all five of
them and leave me alone."

75
00:04:48,071 --> 00:04:50,206
Secondly, it's a reanimated
human corpse, limited in

76
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:52,842
its ability so it's actually
a rotting corpse.

77
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,044
Thirdly, a biological
infection which is,

78
00:04:55,078 --> 00:04:57,880
I think, what makes zombies
really, really scary.

79
00:04:57,914 --> 00:05:00,483
MAN: They're us and
they're us having succumbed to

80
00:05:00,516 --> 00:05:03,086
our worst fear
which is our own death.

81
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:06,089
You can't outstrip them even
though they're slower than you.

82
00:05:06,122 --> 00:05:08,658
Eventually you have
to go to sleep.

83
00:05:08,691 --> 00:05:11,060
They don't, so even if
you're a mile ahead of them,

84
00:05:11,094 --> 00:05:13,463
when you're snoring
they'll catch up and meet you.

85
00:05:13,496 --> 00:05:15,365
And that's like death itself.

86
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,867
You do everything
you can to stave it off.

87
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,870
You do the steps at Santa
Monica, you don't eat red meat.

88
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:22,839
They'll get you in the end.

89
00:05:25,808 --> 00:05:29,512
Most famous monsters,
the big-screen monsters

90
00:05:29,545 --> 00:05:31,547
have some kind of
long-standing tradition

91
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:35,251
where their stories have been
developed previously --

92
00:05:35,284 --> 00:05:38,087
the vampire, the werewolf,
even the slasher,

93
00:05:38,121 --> 00:05:42,291
the serial killer comes out
of a crime novel tradition.

94
00:05:42,325 --> 00:05:45,828
The zombie comes kind of
directly out of folklore

95
00:05:45,862 --> 00:05:48,998
and there really wasn't a
literary narrative tradition.

96
00:05:49,032 --> 00:05:52,035
When you take a look at zombies
in cinema specifically,

97
00:05:52,068 --> 00:05:54,937
you can technically go
back into the silent era.

98
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:57,874
There are, of course, classics
like "Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,"

99
00:05:57,907 --> 00:06:00,109
where you have the sleepwalking
character in there who is

100
00:06:00,143 --> 00:06:04,347
very much zombie-like, and yet
for all intents and purposes,

101
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,183
we all have kind of
collectively agreed,

102
00:06:07,216 --> 00:06:11,220
it all starts in 1932
with "White Zombie."

103
00:06:12,588 --> 00:06:13,856
Zombies!

104
00:06:15,691 --> 00:06:17,527
The filmmakers in the '30s
and '40s were kind of

105
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,463
making up these
stories out of nothing.

106
00:06:20,496 --> 00:06:23,299
They weren't taking existing
material and adapting it.

107
00:06:23,332 --> 00:06:25,935
If anything, they were
drawing on misconceptions

108
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:30,440
and misunderstandings of race
relations in the colonies,

109
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:33,409
sensational ideas of
what voodoo and folklore

110
00:06:33,443 --> 00:06:34,811
really meant in Haiti.

111
00:06:34,844 --> 00:06:37,447
They took that idea and
they kind of merged it with

112
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,116
the visual style
of Todd Browning

113
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,185
and the gothic tradition.

114
00:06:42,218 --> 00:06:47,156
I thought that beauty
alone would satisfy,

115
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:50,626
but the soul is gone.

116
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:55,498
I can't bear those
empty, staring eyes.

117
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:58,801
So in "White Zombie," you get
a narrative that takes place

118
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:02,772
in Haiti and it involves
Haitian voodoo, but then there's

119
00:07:02,805 --> 00:07:06,843
a gothic castle on the coast
of Haiti for some reason.

120
00:07:06,876 --> 00:07:10,113
So it's this weird fusion
of a misunderstood,

121
00:07:10,146 --> 00:07:14,550
sensationalized folklore with
an established and successful

122
00:07:14,584 --> 00:07:17,854
cinematic tradition
for monsters.

123
00:07:17,887 --> 00:07:20,423
The early films are always about

124
00:07:20,456 --> 00:07:23,059
black people
menacing white women.

125
00:07:23,092 --> 00:07:26,963
It's really the enslavement
by the former slaves

126
00:07:26,996 --> 00:07:31,267
that makes that monster
initially so terrifying.

127
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,903
The next major step in sort of
the evolution of the zombies

128
00:07:33,936 --> 00:07:37,607
of pop culture icon comes
when science fiction briefly

129
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,277
takes the lead over
horror in the 1950s

130
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:44,580
and then you get movies
like "Invisible Invaders..."

131
00:07:44,614 --> 00:07:46,849
People of Earth,
this is your last warning.

132
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:50,620
...in which aliens resurrect
human corpses and use them

133
00:07:50,653 --> 00:07:54,991
like puppets to try to take over
which is virtually the same plot

134
00:07:55,024 --> 00:07:57,493
as "Plan 9 from Outer Space,"
one of the most infamous movies

135
00:07:57,527 --> 00:08:00,196
of all time, and what's
interesting about those movies

136
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:03,432
is there we have it, we have
dead people coming back.

137
00:08:03,466 --> 00:08:05,101
They're not
demonically possessed.

138
00:08:05,134 --> 00:08:07,937
They're not impelled by
some desire to eat flesh

139
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,605
or something we don't know.

140
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:13,976
They're being puppeteered by
aliens, but they're zombies

141
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,878
and they're more like
the zombies we know today

142
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,648
than the ones that
preceded them.

143
00:08:18,681 --> 00:08:20,449
But then what happened
was George Romero...

144
00:08:20,483 --> 00:08:26,289
TV: The dead who live
on living flesh.

145
00:08:26,322 --> 00:08:31,027
The dead whose haunted
souls hunt the living.

146
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,764
The living whose bodies
are the only food for these

147
00:08:34,797 --> 00:08:37,833
ungodly creatures.

148
00:08:37,867 --> 00:08:42,672
(screaming)

149
00:08:42,705 --> 00:08:46,042
"Night of the Living Dead."

150
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,681
We were trying to
create a new creature,

151
00:08:51,714 --> 00:08:55,484
somebody that was
dead but came back.

152
00:08:55,518 --> 00:08:57,353
We didn't have a name
for that creature.

153
00:08:57,386 --> 00:08:59,155
We called them ghouls.

154
00:09:00,656 --> 00:09:04,227
I said, "George, who are these
characters chasing this girl?"

155
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,162
He said, "I don't know."

156
00:09:06,195 --> 00:09:08,097
And I said, "Well,
when I was reading it,

157
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,032
it seemed to me they
could be dead people."

158
00:09:10,066 --> 00:09:11,267
He said, "That's good."

159
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,436
I said, "But what do they do?
You don't say that either."

160
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,838
He said, "I don't know."

161
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:19,442
I said, "Why don't we use
my flesh-eating idea?"

162
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:22,178
GEORGE: There was an article
in "Cahiers du Cinema"

163
00:09:22,211 --> 00:09:25,014
that called them zombies
for the first time.

164
00:09:25,047 --> 00:09:28,918
I was clinging to the idea that
we had created something new

165
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:32,855
and when I read that article,
I said, this ain't new at all,

166
00:09:32,888 --> 00:09:37,159
so that's when I started to
accept them as zombies.

167
00:09:39,729 --> 00:09:41,197
(screaming)

168
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:44,700
"Night of the Living Dead"
did not create zombies

169
00:09:44,734 --> 00:09:48,471
but it rewrote zombie lore.

170
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,273
I like to say that there
were zombie movies

171
00:09:50,306 --> 00:09:52,174
before George Romero,
the same way there were

172
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:54,143
space movies before
George Lucas.

173
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:55,177
It changed everything.

174
00:09:55,211 --> 00:09:59,882
It scrapped the old
voodoo zombie and gave us

175
00:09:59,915 --> 00:10:03,552
the plague-driven flesh eater.

176
00:10:03,586 --> 00:10:07,189
The idea of the end of the world
and zombies are around

177
00:10:07,223 --> 00:10:09,659
and the world's been
overtaken by them

178
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:12,695
and it's people against zombies
and our population is dwindling

179
00:10:12,728 --> 00:10:14,864
was introduced in that movie
and no one had ever really

180
00:10:14,897 --> 00:10:17,500
taken zombies in that
direction before.

181
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:20,503
It's almost as if the zombie
as we know it was some sort of

182
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,571
like biblical figure
that's been around forever

183
00:10:22,605 --> 00:10:23,973
and we can all
pick up and use it.

184
00:10:24,006 --> 00:10:26,642
It's not, it was George's idea,
the whole biting thing,

185
00:10:26,676 --> 00:10:31,113
the passing on the disease,
the waking up -- all George.

186
00:10:31,147 --> 00:10:36,319
What's monumental to me about
that film was the fact that

187
00:10:36,352 --> 00:10:41,824
in 1968, this film was
released with a black man

188
00:10:41,857 --> 00:10:46,028
and a white woman, and
throughout the entire movie,

189
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:50,299
nobody made a big deal
out of the fact that

190
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:53,069
we had two different colors.

191
00:10:53,102 --> 00:10:55,738
It was pure survival.

192
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:05,981
GEORGE: We thought we were
pushing the envelope a little.

193
00:11:06,015 --> 00:11:08,250
We thought that some of
the scenes with the guts

194
00:11:08,284 --> 00:11:12,154
and when the kids get
roasted in the truck...

195
00:11:12,188 --> 00:11:15,858
we had actually one shot of
a naked zombie from behind.

196
00:11:15,891 --> 00:11:18,761
Bold -- that's about
as bold as we went.

197
00:11:18,794 --> 00:11:24,133
There were extreme audience
and media reactions.

198
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:28,637
Reviewers who thought that
we were satanically inspired,

199
00:11:28,671 --> 00:11:32,641
that we were scourges, that
our film should be banned.

200
00:11:32,675 --> 00:11:35,745
Horror movies were not
raw like that back then.

201
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:39,048
George's was almost like a
real thing, a documentary.

202
00:11:39,081 --> 00:11:40,850
The reaction to that movie
is what really got me going

203
00:11:40,883 --> 00:11:43,853
because it said people
were fainting in theatres

204
00:11:43,886 --> 00:11:47,990
and I thought, I don't think
I want to see this movie.

205
00:11:48,023 --> 00:11:50,159
It made me not want to see it
and then when I saw it,

206
00:11:50,192 --> 00:11:52,228
I was like, yeah, that's why
I didn't want to see it.

207
00:11:52,261 --> 00:11:55,231
I remember the first time I saw
it was at a midnight screening

208
00:11:55,264 --> 00:11:57,566
and the audience was
absolutely terrified.

209
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,836
The sequence that blew people
away was the little girl

210
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,706
down in the basement
who we discover

211
00:12:03,739 --> 00:12:07,543
is chewing on her
parents' intestines.

212
00:12:07,576 --> 00:12:08,744
The entire audience flipped out.

213
00:12:08,778 --> 00:12:11,847
People got up and left the
theatre during that scene.

214
00:12:11,881 --> 00:12:16,886
Midway through the movie
I hear this "boom, boom, boom,"

215
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:18,654
and I'm wondering
what's going on?

216
00:12:18,687 --> 00:12:20,122
Was this part of the movie?

217
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:24,894
And all of a sudden, I see
this guy go down the aisle...

218
00:12:24,927 --> 00:12:28,664
He blasts through
the doors, out to the curb

219
00:12:28,697 --> 00:12:34,336
and goes, blech...
all over Cambridge Avenue.

220
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:37,339
I said, okay,
I've got to meet this guy.

221
00:12:37,373 --> 00:12:40,342
Whoever made this movie,
I've got to meet this guy.

222
00:12:40,376 --> 00:12:46,982

231
00:13:38,767 --> 00:13:40,936
The greatest zombie film in my
opinion is "Dawn of the Dead."

232
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:44,006
Every time it's scary,
it becomes funny,

233
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:45,441
and every time it's funny
it becomes scary.

234
00:13:45,474 --> 00:13:46,809
Zombies on an ice skating rink,

235
00:13:46,842 --> 00:13:48,711
it doesn't get any
funnier than that.

236
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:51,647
It almost as if history
conspires to hand Romero

237
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,483
the absolute perfect
metaphor for the zombie.

238
00:13:54,517 --> 00:13:56,418
You couldn't do any
better than that.

239
00:13:56,452 --> 00:13:59,421
We're a nation that has become
the shambling consumers

240
00:13:59,455 --> 00:14:01,824
that walk up and down the
hallways desperately wanting

241
00:14:01,857 --> 00:14:05,394
to consume and we have
lost all individuality.

242
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:07,530
It's absolutely perfect.

243
00:14:07,563 --> 00:14:10,466
For me, "Dawn of the Dead" was
kind of the seminal zombie movie

244
00:14:10,499 --> 00:14:12,134
because it really
was the middle finger

245
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:14,169
to the death of
the baby boomers.

246
00:14:14,203 --> 00:14:18,073
It was this generation that
started off so idealistic

247
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:22,011
and was so, "Hey man, don't
trust anyone over 30, man.

248
00:14:22,044 --> 00:14:23,946
Don't trust anyone over 30!"

249
00:14:23,979 --> 00:14:25,648
And then they turn 30!

250
00:14:25,681 --> 00:14:27,950
(laughter)

251
00:14:27,983 --> 00:14:30,286
I mean, that moment where
they say, "What is that?"

252
00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:32,388
And he goes, "Looks like
a shopping center,

253
00:14:32,421 --> 00:14:33,822
one of those new
indoor malls."

254
00:14:33,856 --> 00:14:36,091
See, there were no
shopping centers.

255
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:40,062
That was the first shopping
center that we had ever seen.

256
00:14:40,095 --> 00:14:42,798
With the dawn of the
death of the ideals.

257
00:14:42,831 --> 00:14:46,769
Every time it's Black Friday,
how can you not think of

258
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,571
"Dawn of the Dead?"

259
00:14:48,604 --> 00:14:55,611
It's chilling and disgusting
all at once, you know?

260
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:58,113
MAN: So there is this
evolutionary process that George

261
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:01,317
is going through and in "Day..."
what he does is he says,

262
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:04,887
okay, now we're going to
see the zombies evolve,

263
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,357
and that was groundbreaking.

264
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:12,061
That's what George's genius is,
I think, that he completely

265
00:15:12,094 --> 00:15:15,297
swaps allegiances
with his films.

266
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,833
Often, you'll root for
the zombies which is, you know,

267
00:15:17,866 --> 00:15:20,169
you never root for the zombies
in contemporary zombie films

268
00:15:20,202 --> 00:15:22,571
because they're at our
protagonist's throats literally

269
00:15:22,605 --> 00:15:24,506
and we don't want those
protagonists to die,

270
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,409
whereas, with, particularly
with "Day..." most of the human

271
00:15:27,443 --> 00:15:31,013
characters are hideous,
monstrous, aggressive military

272
00:15:31,046 --> 00:15:33,315
types who you just want
to see torn to pieces

273
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:37,953
and when Bob shoots
Captain Rhodes, you cheer.

274
00:15:49,398 --> 00:15:52,701
It's all down to Howard Sherman
being just so sweet, you know,

275
00:15:52,735 --> 00:15:55,270
when he's using the razor
and he's on the phone

276
00:15:55,304 --> 00:15:57,206
and he's listening to the music
and he's hearing music

277
00:15:57,239 --> 00:15:59,608
for the first time
and it's like a baby.

278
00:15:59,642 --> 00:16:02,711
I just think it's one of the
most beautiful performances

279
00:16:02,745 --> 00:16:06,482
since Karloff's "Frankenstein"
as a kind of adult newborn.

280
00:16:06,515 --> 00:16:07,916
There's something
so deeply tragic

281
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:10,285
and sympathetic about him.

282
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:11,520
Oh, I don't feel that at all.

283
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,722
There's nothing tragic
in a reanimated corpse.

284
00:16:13,756 --> 00:16:14,790
How can there be?

285
00:16:14,823 --> 00:16:17,359
A reanimated corpse is
just a reanimated corpse.

286
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,460
There's nothing tragic about it.

287
00:16:18,494 --> 00:16:19,828
You shoot it in the head.

288
00:16:19,862 --> 00:16:21,463
Bob's your uncle.

289
00:16:21,497 --> 00:16:25,768
HOWARD: Boris Karloff, with that
role, had the opportunity to do

290
00:16:25,801 --> 00:16:32,341
a lot of very subtle intimate
things, most monsters don't.

291
00:16:32,374 --> 00:16:34,843
In, as Bob, I did too.

292
00:16:34,877 --> 00:16:38,280
I had a lot of very
interesting, subtle,

293
00:16:38,313 --> 00:16:42,851
and by genre standards,
very unusual things to do

294
00:16:42,885 --> 00:16:48,891
and the fact that I had the
opportunity to do something

295
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:52,294
like that is what brought
an element of humanity to it

296
00:16:52,327 --> 00:16:55,564
that normally you just
don't find in the genre.

297
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:58,634
GEORGE: I don't think
zombies are intelligent.

298
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:01,336
I think that they just
remember what they used to do,

299
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:02,705
what they used to be.

300
00:17:02,738 --> 00:17:07,376
My zombie characters that have
some personality, I think,

301
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:13,348
are just -- what they do
because of their memory

302
00:17:13,382 --> 00:17:18,787
makes them a bit heroic,
but it's just memory.

303
00:17:18,821 --> 00:17:20,022
It's just memory.

304
00:17:20,055 --> 00:17:21,757
I mean, it's just like when
you first see Big Daddy

305
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:25,360
in "Land of the Dead,"
he's doing what he always did.

306
00:17:25,394 --> 00:17:27,830
He's trying to fill gas.

307
00:17:27,863 --> 00:17:31,467
He hears the bell, "ding-ding"
and he thinks a car came in,

308
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,269
so he comes out looking
to fill somebody's car.

309
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:39,141
I mean, that's how stupid
he is, but he's heroic.

310
00:17:39,174 --> 00:17:40,676
(laughing)

311
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,255
(yawning)

312
00:17:53,288 --> 00:17:55,657
What a perfectly
average morning,

313
00:17:55,691 --> 00:17:59,061
nothing unusual about today
which makes it the perfect day

314
00:17:59,094 --> 00:18:02,931
for a zombie apocalypse
to not happen.

315
00:18:03,699 --> 00:18:06,068
(humming)

316
00:18:06,101 --> 00:18:07,870
It's beautiful morning.

317
00:18:07,903 --> 00:18:11,073
Mmm, I smell breakfast cooking.

318
00:18:11,106 --> 00:18:14,343
Oh, what's this on the news?

319
00:18:14,376 --> 00:18:16,645
But it has been
reported that the dead

320
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:19,014
are coming
back to life.

321
00:18:19,047 --> 00:18:19,948
Oh my God!

322
00:18:19,982 --> 00:18:21,817
The president is
declaring marshal law

323
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,386
for the state
of New York.

324
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:26,421
Betty? Is that you?

325
00:18:26,455 --> 00:18:29,091
Is that blood all
over your jammy-jams?

326
00:18:29,124 --> 00:18:30,659
Why are you just standing there?

327
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:34,630
Why is there a smoke machine
running in the hallway now?

328
00:18:34,663 --> 00:18:35,731
Oh well.

329
00:18:35,764 --> 00:18:37,466
Even though I've seen this
scene a million times

330
00:18:37,499 --> 00:18:40,369
in every movie, I'm just
going to slowly start

331
00:18:40,402 --> 00:18:43,939
walking towards you with
my arms outstretched,

332
00:18:43,972 --> 00:18:46,141
asking if everything's
okay, even though

333
00:18:46,175 --> 00:18:49,578
this looks highly suspicious and
at any moment you're going to...

334
00:18:49,611 --> 00:18:51,380
Oh my God!

335
00:18:51,413 --> 00:18:54,249
Zombies are the only horror
films that I know where

336
00:18:54,283 --> 00:18:56,952
you're totally minding your own
business and you're not looking

337
00:18:56,985 --> 00:19:01,523
for trouble and you're not the
hot girl or the token black guy.

338
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,326
You've broken no rules
to let you get killed

339
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:06,495
but they come for you anyway.

340
00:19:06,528 --> 00:19:08,530
It's not about you,
that's the main thing.

341
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,433
If something is going to
eviscerate you, eat your guts,

342
00:19:11,466 --> 00:19:13,302
you'd like it to be
about your guts, right?

343
00:19:13,335 --> 00:19:16,605
You'd like your guts to be
special, but if I can just

344
00:19:16,638 --> 00:19:19,541
step to the left and
he eats that guy's guts,

345
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,243
it's not about
me anymore.

346
00:19:21,276 --> 00:19:22,344
Vampires are
all about me.

347
00:19:22,377 --> 00:19:24,646
They make me feel sexy and
libidinal and all that.

348
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,982
Zombies, they could
care less about me

349
00:19:27,015 --> 00:19:28,383
and that's actually
our biggest nightmare.

350
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,418
They don't sparkle.

351
00:19:29,451 --> 00:19:30,452
Right.

352
00:19:30,485 --> 00:19:32,321
(laughter)

353
00:19:32,354 --> 00:19:34,723
Every time you look at a zombie
in pop culture, whether it's

354
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:38,160
a movie or a television show
or a comic book, anything,

355
00:19:38,193 --> 00:19:40,429
it is ultimately just
a reflection of things

356
00:19:40,462 --> 00:19:42,331
we're afraid of at that moment.

357
00:19:42,364 --> 00:19:44,433
When you start with
"Night of the living Dead,"

358
00:19:44,466 --> 00:19:48,070
1960s, late '60s,
we're afraid of Vietnam,

359
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:50,205
we're afraid of the death
we're seeing on television.

360
00:19:50,239 --> 00:19:52,875
That's easy, but we're also
afraid about what's happening

361
00:19:52,908 --> 00:19:56,612
to the home, the nuclear
family is breaking down.

362
00:19:56,645 --> 00:19:58,313
So "Night of the Living Dead"
becomes a literal

363
00:19:58,347 --> 00:20:00,182
siege on the home.

364
00:20:00,215 --> 00:20:01,917
Jump ahead ten years --
"Dawn of the Dead,"

365
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,051
what are we afraid of now?

366
00:20:03,085 --> 00:20:04,887
Consumerism, consumption.

367
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,889
Jump ahead --
"Day of the Dead,"

368
00:20:06,922 --> 00:20:08,657
now we're afraid
of the Cold War,

369
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:12,494
we're afraid of the apocalypse,
of nuclear destruction.

370
00:20:12,527 --> 00:20:15,464
As the culture changed,
zombies, to an extent,

371
00:20:15,497 --> 00:20:16,598
changed along with it.

372
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,166
In the 1980s all of a sudden,
you see them starting to

373
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,568
get a little bit funny.

374
00:20:19,601 --> 00:20:20,702
You had "Return of
the Living Dead,"

375
00:20:20,736 --> 00:20:22,738
all of a sudden, you have
all this comedy going on.

376
00:20:22,771 --> 00:20:25,207
The '80s were sort of a
little bit of a lighter time.

377
00:20:33,515 --> 00:20:35,817
Brains!

378
00:20:35,851 --> 00:20:39,454
But it's also desperately
frightening and depressing.

379
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,924
That is probably one of
the most, if not the most,

380
00:20:41,957 --> 00:20:44,559
apocalyptic zombie
movies ever made.

381
00:20:44,593 --> 00:20:46,762
They're also the most
indestructible and frightening

382
00:20:46,795 --> 00:20:49,264
zombies in zombie movie history.

383
00:20:49,298 --> 00:20:52,768
If you ever find yourself in
a zombie apocalypse, the key,

384
00:20:52,801 --> 00:20:54,603
the first thing you should
look for is, are you in

385
00:20:54,636 --> 00:20:56,738
the "Return of the Living Dead"
Universe or not,

386
00:20:56,772 --> 00:20:59,841
because if you are, give up,
there's no hope.

387
00:21:00,776 --> 00:21:03,011
Brains!

388
00:21:03,045 --> 00:21:04,246
Another thing that's
interesting about

389
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:07,015
"Return of the Living Dead"
is it gives rise to one of

390
00:21:07,049 --> 00:21:10,886
the longest-lasting aspects of
the zombie in pop culture...

391
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:13,689
More brains!

392
00:21:13,722 --> 00:21:15,090
...and that's the idea
of the zombies

393
00:21:15,123 --> 00:21:17,192
coming back wanting brains.

394
00:21:17,225 --> 00:21:28,470
♪ Brains, brains, brains... ♪

395
00:21:28,503 --> 00:21:30,405
So the '90's were kind of,
I don't want to say they were

396
00:21:30,439 --> 00:21:33,742
a dead era, but they were
definitely slow comparatively.

397
00:21:33,775 --> 00:21:35,577
Party's over.

398
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:37,412
"Dead Alive," Peter Jackson's
Sumatran rat-monkey

399
00:21:37,446 --> 00:21:40,849
family issue,
gore-fest insanity.

400
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:43,552
It was probably the most
important film of the '90s.

401
00:21:46,488 --> 00:21:47,889
And then 9/11 came along

402
00:21:47,923 --> 00:21:50,659
and all of a sudden,
everything felt up-ended.

403
00:21:50,692 --> 00:21:53,028
I think it primed the
culture, the larger culture,

404
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:55,130
not the people who
already like zombies,

405
00:21:55,163 --> 00:21:59,301
but the larger culture to
accept and entertain the idea

406
00:21:59,334 --> 00:22:02,571
of apocalyptic scenarios
being a possibility.

407
00:22:02,604 --> 00:22:05,307
A few years later when Katrina
happened, anyone who still had

408
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,776
faith, "don't worry, no matter
what happens, we can handle it,"

409
00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:09,344
this was an aberration.

410
00:22:09,378 --> 00:22:11,747
I think that shook it as well.

411
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,749
I don't think the zombie culture
would be where it was today

412
00:22:13,782 --> 00:22:15,717
if it weren't for
those kind of things.

413
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,854
It brought death to
people's doorstep.

414
00:22:18,887 --> 00:22:22,758
You have "28 Days Later" which
has plenty of imagery which is

415
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:27,329
evocative of an apocalypse
or a natural disaster.

416
00:22:27,362 --> 00:22:30,265
This fear of disease, so we
start seeing more and more

417
00:22:30,298 --> 00:22:34,102
of the infection narratives
and the invasion narratives

418
00:22:34,136 --> 00:22:38,340
as a kind of a reflection of
the fears of the 21st century.

419
00:22:38,373 --> 00:22:42,411
Zombies are very versatile as
metaphors because they are us.

420
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,946
They are the people among you,

421
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,482
and I think maybe that
preoccupation in society,

422
00:22:47,516 --> 00:22:50,585
the lack of safety that
we're suddenly all feeling,

423
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:55,190
zombies are a good way to
cathartically act out that fear.

424
00:22:55,223 --> 00:22:57,893
What I always find
fascinating about zombies

425
00:22:57,926 --> 00:23:01,930
is the "Invasion of the
Body Snatchers" aspect.

426
00:23:06,701 --> 00:23:11,773
The most horrific idea is
that your brother, your wife,

427
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:17,746
your sister, a loved one,
externally, on the outside,

428
00:23:17,779 --> 00:23:21,083
that person is exactly the same,
but on the inside

429
00:23:21,116 --> 00:23:23,852
everything is gone,
everything is erased.

430
00:23:26,421 --> 00:23:29,491
KYLE: To me, what the zombie
narrative is really about

431
00:23:29,524 --> 00:23:32,661
is losing friends and family.

432
00:23:32,694 --> 00:23:38,700
Having your loved ones turn
against you, become monstrous,

433
00:23:38,733 --> 00:23:41,470
but the biggest threat that
you face isn't some nameless,

434
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:45,006
faceless, other monster --
it's your mom,

435
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,808
it's your sister,
it's your wife.

436
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:50,745
That, to me, encapsulates
the real terror of the zombie,

437
00:23:50,779 --> 00:23:53,415
the fact that we all have
the potential within us

438
00:23:53,448 --> 00:23:54,649
to be monstrous.

439
00:23:54,683 --> 00:24:03,592
♪

440
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:05,994
There's that trailer,
it's called "Dead Island,"

441
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:09,064
it was a video game and you
see this kind of freaky girl

442
00:24:09,097 --> 00:24:12,501
attacking an older man and then
it kind of all goes in reverse

443
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,736
ending with it being
like a family vacation

444
00:24:14,769 --> 00:24:16,371
and they're taking
a photo together.

445
00:24:16,404 --> 00:24:19,808
You realize it was his daughter
that he's beating with a bat.

446
00:24:19,841 --> 00:24:20,842
(laughing)

447
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:21,943
It was pretty awesome.

448
00:24:21,977 --> 00:24:24,713
I dreamt about them last night,
I dreamt about them.

449
00:24:24,746 --> 00:24:28,517
I thought making "Shaun
of the Dead" would stop

450
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,685
my recurring dreams about
zombies, but it hasn't.

451
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:33,555
I still occasionally have
a dream where I'm in

452
00:24:33,588 --> 00:24:37,058
that classic situation where
they're outside the house

453
00:24:37,092 --> 00:24:41,429
and I can't get away
and it's fucking terrifying.

454
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,066
"Shaun" happened because
Edgar Wright and myself

455
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,502
were making a TV show, "Spaced."

456
00:24:47,536 --> 00:24:49,437
The beginning of one of
the episodes starts with me

457
00:24:49,471 --> 00:24:53,375
lost in the game "Resident Evil"
and it was just a very sort of

458
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:58,547
sneaky way to enable myself
to shoot some zombies.

459
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,183
They totally captured that
feeling of Romero's films,

460
00:25:01,216 --> 00:25:02,384
that shambolic zombie.

461
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,252
It looked like they'd almost
watched those movies

462
00:25:04,286 --> 00:25:06,555
to get the way those
creatures moved.

463
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:09,858
It really ignited that
sort of love in me again,

464
00:25:09,891 --> 00:25:11,626
and Edgar as well, and
we started talking about

465
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,361
"Dawn of the Dead" and
how much we loved it

466
00:25:13,395 --> 00:25:15,163
and then we had
"Dawn of the Dead" on set,

467
00:25:15,197 --> 00:25:16,932
and we were like, we should
make a zombie film.

468
00:25:23,672 --> 00:25:26,975
Well, I have to say that
"Shaun of the Dead" was probably

469
00:25:27,008 --> 00:25:30,912
my favorite zombie film
that wasn't made by me.

470
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,715
I think "Shaun of the Dead"
is probably

471
00:25:33,748 --> 00:25:35,317
the second most important
zombie film ever made

472
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:37,786
because of the
social commentary.

473
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:42,591
It encapsulates an
entire generation

474
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:45,227
of young English people
in the very same way

475
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,830
Kevin Smith's "Clerks"
encapsulated my generation.

476
00:25:48,863 --> 00:25:50,699
Forget zombies, I think if
you just were going to look

477
00:25:50,732 --> 00:25:54,102
at a movie that put that
generation through a lens,

478
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:55,937
that's "Shaun of the Dead."

479
00:25:59,741 --> 00:26:01,543
The "Walking Dead" came about
because of my love

480
00:26:01,576 --> 00:26:06,481
of George Romero films and
zombie movies in general.

481
00:26:06,514 --> 00:26:09,517
Most zombie films end with
either all of the characters

482
00:26:09,551 --> 00:26:12,387
dying or two or three of
the characters living,

483
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,889
while all of the others die
and they kind of ride off

484
00:26:14,923 --> 00:26:17,158
into the sunset and you
never know where they go.

485
00:26:17,192 --> 00:26:20,328
The "Walking Dead"
was devised as

486
00:26:20,362 --> 00:26:23,531
the zombie movie
that never ends.

487
00:26:23,565 --> 00:26:28,470
I will plainly say that Bram
Stoker is to Stephenie Meyer

488
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,705
as George Romero is
to Robert Kirkman.

489
00:26:30,739 --> 00:26:33,074
There is no "Walking Dead"
without "Night of the Living

490
00:26:33,108 --> 00:26:35,877
Dead," "Dawn of the Dead,"
"Day of the Dead."

491
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:37,312
I definitely owe that guy.

492
00:26:40,649 --> 00:26:43,885
When Ben comes out of that house
at the end of

493
00:26:43,918 --> 00:26:46,888
"Night of the Living Dead," and
you think he's getting rescued

494
00:26:46,921 --> 00:26:49,224
and instead he gets shot...

495
00:26:49,257 --> 00:26:51,126
Okay, he's dead.
Let's go get him.

496
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:52,861
That's another one
for the farm.

497
00:26:52,894 --> 00:26:54,796
...the sinking feeling
that that gives you,

498
00:26:54,829 --> 00:26:58,433
the sense of loss,
definitely inspires the way

499
00:26:58,466 --> 00:27:01,069
that I want to mess
with expectations.

500
00:27:01,102 --> 00:27:05,340
If characters weren't dying
constantly in a zombie story,

501
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:08,376
in an apocalyptic story,
it would be completely false

502
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:11,713
and fake and unrealistic and
it'd be complete bullshit

503
00:27:11,746 --> 00:27:14,249
and there are times when I'm
writing a "Walking Dead" comic

504
00:27:14,282 --> 00:27:17,319
where I'll go, wait a minute,
it's been like ten issues

505
00:27:17,352 --> 00:27:18,620
and no one's died.

506
00:27:18,653 --> 00:27:21,423
This sucks, someone's
got to die this issue.

507
00:27:21,456 --> 00:27:25,994
People gots to die,
otherwise it's just dull.

508
00:27:29,164 --> 00:27:32,434
Because the zombie was kind of
organically created by different

509
00:27:32,467 --> 00:27:36,938
people, I think filmmakers and
authors and video game designers

510
00:27:36,971 --> 00:27:40,809
feel they have a great deal of
liberty with what a zombie is,

511
00:27:40,842 --> 00:27:43,211
so we can have
zombies that are dead,

512
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:45,413
but we can also have
zombies that are alive.

513
00:27:45,447 --> 00:27:47,816
You can have zombies that drink
blood, but you can also have

514
00:27:47,849 --> 00:27:50,585
zombies that eat flesh
or just eat brains.

515
00:27:50,618 --> 00:27:52,253
You can have zombies
that are weak,

516
00:27:52,287 --> 00:27:55,690
you can have zombies that are
super strong, some zombies talk,

517
00:27:55,724 --> 00:28:00,362
most don't, some can
feel things, some can't.

518
00:28:00,395 --> 00:28:03,064
That movie "Wall-E,"
you know, the Pixar movie,

519
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:05,400
I feel like that's kind of
a zombie movie, you know,

520
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:07,969
when he goes up and the robot
finds all the earthlings

521
00:28:08,002 --> 00:28:11,639
that are just these fat blobs
hooked up to machines.

522
00:28:11,673 --> 00:28:14,542
Those are G-rated,
benevolent zombies.

523
00:28:14,576 --> 00:28:18,146
(screaming)

524
00:28:22,517 --> 00:28:24,486
We got into this
idea in "Reanimator,"

525
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:27,455
that when they're reanimated,
that it somehow frees their

526
00:28:27,489 --> 00:28:30,658
libido and so that's
kind of what Dr. Hill is.

527
00:28:30,692 --> 00:28:33,628
This is a guy who is lusting
after the dean's daughter,

528
00:28:33,661 --> 00:28:39,100
but never was able to really
act on it until he's reanimated

529
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,736
and in the course of the movie,
he converts himself as

530
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:43,605
the improved Dr. Hill.

531
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:47,442
In a way, it's a more
honest doctor.

532
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:50,311
He almost breaks the
rules of the zombie

533
00:28:50,345 --> 00:28:53,548
because he has a stronger
idea of who he is.

534
00:28:53,581 --> 00:28:56,684
Deadites and zombies are
from different families,

535
00:28:56,718 --> 00:28:58,353
different species.

536
00:28:58,386 --> 00:29:01,289
A deadite is someone
who isn't necessarily dead,

537
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:02,924
they just got possessed.

538
00:29:02,957 --> 00:29:05,593
It's weird, in "Evil Dead,"
we have both.

539
00:29:05,627 --> 00:29:08,897
In "Army of Darkness,"
we have an army of the dead,

540
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:11,566
skeletons coming back
and they get to talk.

541
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:13,902
I don't know how they do that
without a larynx, but you know.

542
00:29:13,935 --> 00:29:15,804
Bring on the wench!

543
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,472
I think with like "Army of
Darkness," you didn't want

544
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:20,008
to be alive or dead, you didn't
even want to be in that movie

545
00:29:20,041 --> 00:29:22,811
if you weren't Ash, because
everyone else is dead

546
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,779
or possessed ultimately.

547
00:29:24,813 --> 00:29:27,615
Anybody that argues that because
something is alive can't be

548
00:29:27,649 --> 00:29:30,151
a zombie, obviously doesn't
remember the history

549
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,654
about voodoo zombies
and how it all started.

550
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,823
So I count the infected.

551
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,291
Even though Danny Boyle
would say he didn't make

552
00:29:36,324 --> 00:29:38,960
a zombie movie,
but I'm sorry, he's wrong.

553
00:29:38,993 --> 00:29:40,695
He actually made a zombie movie.

554
00:29:42,397 --> 00:29:44,732
So the word zombie, as we spell
it in English, is pretty close

555
00:29:44,766 --> 00:29:48,403
to the Haitian/French "zombi,"
with just a terminal "I"

556
00:29:48,436 --> 00:29:51,706
and it probably comes
from a Congolese word,

557
00:29:51,739 --> 00:29:54,909
"Nzambi" with an "N."

558
00:29:54,943 --> 00:29:58,046
WOMAN: In some places,
there is a God named Nzambi.

559
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:00,448
There was a revolutionary
hero named Nzambi.

560
00:30:00,482 --> 00:30:02,884
Some people have associated it
with a type of bird.

561
00:30:02,917 --> 00:30:06,187
Other people say there's
a plant called zombie.

562
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:14,229
The zombie is somebody who
was supposed to be dead,

563
00:30:14,262 --> 00:30:16,331
but who's not.

564
00:30:16,364 --> 00:30:20,168
The origin of the zombie
in Africa was a separation

565
00:30:20,201 --> 00:30:25,073
of spirit from body and being
stuck in the mortal world.

566
00:30:25,106 --> 00:30:28,276
WOMAN: Dutch slavers,
Portuguese slavers heard tales

567
00:30:28,309 --> 00:30:31,045
of these fears that
the people had that

568
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:35,416
witch doctors were capable
of stealing their souls.

569
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,685
They would steal
a person's soul,

570
00:30:37,719 --> 00:30:39,521
put it in some kind of vessel,

571
00:30:39,554 --> 00:30:44,158
and then the body would keep
laboring for the witch doctor.

572
00:30:44,192 --> 00:30:47,829
Somewhere around
the colony of San Domingue,

573
00:30:47,862 --> 00:30:52,033
around the Haitian Revolution
of 1800, the word zombie

574
00:30:52,066 --> 00:30:54,636
and the soul capture
mythology come together

575
00:30:54,669 --> 00:30:56,538
and from that point on,
we're talking about

576
00:30:56,571 --> 00:30:59,140
the zombie as
a walking corpse.

577
00:31:00,742 --> 00:31:04,379
Zombification is just one of
the things they do as a form of

578
00:31:04,412 --> 00:31:10,552
punishment, where you go into a
form of slavery never to return.

579
00:31:10,585 --> 00:31:14,989
EMERANTE: Since he doesn't have
any life, they think he's dead.

580
00:31:15,023 --> 00:31:17,125
They bury the person.

581
00:31:17,158 --> 00:31:20,161
He has a certain
time to wake up.

582
00:31:20,194 --> 00:31:23,731
They take the person
out of where he is buried.

583
00:31:23,765 --> 00:31:32,473
He's still half awake and
half dead and that's a zombie.

584
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:37,579
If you want to understand what
is a zombie, it is somebody

585
00:31:37,612 --> 00:31:44,285
who has one part of his identity
that has been torn down.

586
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:47,822
You have a part of your
intelligence that's like a

587
00:31:47,855 --> 00:31:52,293
window and when it's torn down,
you lose your will,

588
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:56,230
and that will lead the will
of doing bad things to others,

589
00:31:56,264 --> 00:31:59,467
and this is what Hollywood
has not understood

590
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,904
is he cannot do harm.

591
00:32:02,937 --> 00:32:08,309
In other places, people who
commit crimes are usually put

592
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:13,681
in a gas chamber or they are
killed by the electric chair,

593
00:32:13,715 --> 00:32:15,750
which to me is horrible.

594
00:32:15,783 --> 00:32:22,957
In fact, it is desecrating
the human being because

595
00:32:22,991 --> 00:32:26,728
a human being should be treated
with respect all the time.

596
00:32:26,761 --> 00:32:32,200
To me, zombification
is something spiritual.

597
00:32:38,139 --> 00:32:42,577
Wade Davis famously went down
from Harvard as an ethnobotanist

598
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:45,780
and he did some research into
what could possibly be

599
00:32:45,813 --> 00:32:50,018
the scientific origins
of this tradition.

600
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:53,154
SARAH: Davis theorized that
it was actually possible

601
00:32:53,187 --> 00:32:57,425
with a poison, it's called
tetrodotoxin, to poison someone,

602
00:32:57,458 --> 00:33:00,328
give them the appearance of
death that was so believable

603
00:33:00,361 --> 00:33:03,331
that you could then have them
buried, have a funeral for them,

604
00:33:03,364 --> 00:33:07,468
dig them up later, and then keep
them in a kind of comatose state

605
00:33:07,502 --> 00:33:10,538
so that they would only be able
to do the most basic commands,

606
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:13,374
so that, in effect, you could
keep them as a slave,

607
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,476
as a slave that people
would perceive to be

608
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:18,846
nothing but the walking dead.

609
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,617
KYLE: We have evidence that
people being turned into zombies

610
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:25,753
was a real problem in Haiti
because part of the Haitian

611
00:33:25,787 --> 00:33:29,724
criminal code actually
has a law against

612
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,459
turning people into zombies.

613
00:33:31,492 --> 00:33:33,294
It's actually on their books.

614
00:33:33,327 --> 00:33:37,632
It is illegal to poison someone,
bring them back,

615
00:33:37,665 --> 00:33:40,835
and sell them as slaves.

616
00:33:40,868 --> 00:33:43,171
SARAH: Even though we think of
this as an American monster,

617
00:33:43,204 --> 00:33:45,106
this is part of
a bigger mythology,

618
00:33:45,139 --> 00:33:48,509
one that isn't uniquely ours,
but is more global, one that

619
00:33:48,543 --> 00:33:52,313
really comes to us from Africa,
and from its inception,

620
00:33:52,346 --> 00:33:56,617
is very much about slavery and
from its sort of pivotal turn

621
00:33:56,651 --> 00:34:01,456
it makes in Haiti, becomes
a lot about slave rebellion.

622
00:34:05,259 --> 00:34:06,761
Damn Zombies.

623
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:10,364
These nails cost me $2.49 a box.

624
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:13,201
It's a good thing I had all
this scrap wood though.

625
00:34:13,234 --> 00:34:14,635
Well, that's that.

626
00:34:14,669 --> 00:34:17,638
I wonder if these zombies are
going to be the fast ones

627
00:34:17,672 --> 00:34:19,173
or the slow ones.

628
00:34:19,207 --> 00:34:21,943
I hope they're the slow ones
because I'm an old man.

629
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:22,977
Oh, there's one now.

630
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:25,313
Oh great, they're
the fast zombies.

631
00:34:25,346 --> 00:34:26,547
That's no good for me.

632
00:34:26,581 --> 00:34:28,549
Oh, wait a minute,
it's just a jogger.

633
00:34:28,583 --> 00:34:30,017
Whew...

634
00:34:30,051 --> 00:34:33,020
Well, that's good, but that
still doesn't answer my question

635
00:34:33,054 --> 00:34:35,223
whether or not
the zombies are fast ones.

636
00:34:35,256 --> 00:34:37,525
Oh, I guess they're slow ones.

637
00:34:37,558 --> 00:34:40,628
Well, that's good news for me
that they're slow ones, but

638
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:44,966
wait, if you could just run away
from slow zombies with ease,

639
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:48,536
then why aren't all new zombies
old people like me?

640
00:34:48,569 --> 00:34:52,273
In fact, how does a slow zombie
outbreak even get out of control

641
00:34:52,306 --> 00:34:53,975
in the first place?

642
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:56,978
Now I could maybe see a slow
zombie outbreak getting out of

643
00:34:57,011 --> 00:35:01,182
control in a densely occupied
apartment building, but way out

644
00:35:01,215 --> 00:35:04,652
in the country where there's
just so much distance

645
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:07,355
in between the infected
and the living?

646
00:35:07,388 --> 00:35:09,056
Well, not so much.

647
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,295
STEVEN: The slow versus
fast debate is one of

648
00:35:14,328 --> 00:35:16,798
my very favorites
in zombie worlds.

649
00:35:16,831 --> 00:35:18,032
I'm partial to the slow zombies.

650
00:35:18,065 --> 00:35:19,834
I actually think
they're way scarier.

651
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,369
If something's fast and
it's running after you,

652
00:35:21,402 --> 00:35:22,637
you just got to run.

653
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:25,706
If someone is slow and shambling
towards you, you wait because

654
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,775
we have this desire that
it's still human, right?

655
00:35:27,809 --> 00:35:30,244
Like you think, that looks like
my girlfriend, still looks like

656
00:35:30,278 --> 00:35:32,413
my girlfriend, she's stumbling
a little bit, but maybe

657
00:35:32,446 --> 00:35:34,415
it's my girlfriend with a broken
ankle, you don't know,

658
00:35:34,448 --> 00:35:36,684
and you let her get just
a little bit too close.

659
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:38,219
All you've got to do is walk
slightly faster than her,

660
00:35:38,252 --> 00:35:39,921
but you don't.

661
00:35:39,954 --> 00:35:42,390
MAX: The slow zombie gives me
time to think about

662
00:35:42,423 --> 00:35:43,925
how I'm going to die.

663
00:35:43,958 --> 00:35:46,561
It's the difference between
getting shot and getting cancer.

664
00:35:46,594 --> 00:35:49,664
It's about considering all
those horrific possibilities.

665
00:35:50,665 --> 00:35:53,434
SIMON: The whole fast zombie
thing just misses the point.

666
00:35:53,467 --> 00:35:55,436
By removing any aggression from
them, by stopping them from

667
00:35:55,469 --> 00:35:58,873
being almost like screechy
and raptors running at you,

668
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:03,377
they've become something
you can project depth onto.

669
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,179
That's what's so great
about slow zombies is that

670
00:36:05,213 --> 00:36:07,615
you're given time
to get to know them

671
00:36:07,648 --> 00:36:10,518
before you shoot them
in the head.

672
00:36:10,551 --> 00:36:14,088
I do have a whole new level of
respect for horror film actors,

673
00:36:14,121 --> 00:36:18,426
but especially zombie horror
film actors because when they're

674
00:36:18,459 --> 00:36:22,096
slow, you really have to sell
the fear, you know what I mean?

675
00:36:22,129 --> 00:36:26,467
You have to sort of like create
scenarios in which you don't get

676
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:30,004
away from these people that are
moving at the pace of a snail.

677
00:36:30,037 --> 00:36:31,739
Somebody once asked me,
would you write a zombie

678
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:33,040
survival guide for fast zombies?

679
00:36:33,074 --> 00:36:34,375
I'm like, yeah, it would be
a pamphlet that we'd call

680
00:36:34,408 --> 00:36:35,676
"Kiss your ass goodbye."

681
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:37,678
(laughter)

682
00:36:37,712 --> 00:36:42,083
I would argue that potentially
"Shaun of the Dead" had a lot

683
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:47,221
of influence in kind of killing
the slow zombie in movies.

684
00:36:47,255 --> 00:36:50,491
If you have two bumbling idiots
who can throw records at zombies

685
00:36:50,524 --> 00:36:53,628
and sort of accidentally kill
them, it sort of causes problems

686
00:36:53,661 --> 00:36:56,030
in terms of trying to make
the slow zombie really scary.

687
00:36:56,063 --> 00:36:57,798
TOM: This makes me
think of when I directed

688
00:36:57,832 --> 00:37:00,568
"Night of the Living Dead,"
we hired a movement instructor

689
00:37:00,601 --> 00:37:02,870
because my idea was
if you're a zombie,

690
00:37:02,904 --> 00:37:06,207
then you leave your body.

691
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,043
It's like if your body is hung
on a fence and something comes

692
00:37:09,076 --> 00:37:12,747
and takes over the body, that's
never moved a human body before

693
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:16,717
and tries to move and walk,
but it was laughable.

694
00:37:16,751 --> 00:37:21,422
People were doing all kinds
of stupid weird shit with it.

695
00:37:21,455 --> 00:37:24,625
Just walk slow, okay,
just walk slow.

696
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,928
Because as you know, George
Romero believes in slow zombies.

697
00:37:26,961 --> 00:37:29,597
He sells bumper stickers
that say, "Fast Zombies Suck."

698
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:34,969
My basic objection to fast
zombies is that it's impossible!

699
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:36,871
If they're dead,
if they're dead.

700
00:37:36,904 --> 00:37:38,539
SIMON: You know, there's an
argument that Bill Hingmen,

701
00:37:38,572 --> 00:37:40,675
who played the very first zombie
in "Night of the Living Dead,"

702
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:42,710
he was pretty spritely
as a zombie.

703
00:37:42,743 --> 00:37:45,413
He wasn't moving
particularly slowly.

704
00:37:45,446 --> 00:37:48,816
The beginning of zombie
evolution started with

705
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:51,919
quite a quick-footed zombie
to be honest.

706
00:37:51,953 --> 00:37:53,988
GEORGE: When we were making
"Night of the Living Dead,"

707
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:57,692
we had no sense of rules.

708
00:37:57,725 --> 00:38:02,396
It wasn't until I finally agreed
to do another one that I said,

709
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:06,334
well wait, we've got to have
a little process going in.

710
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:07,835
We have to have something.

711
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:13,240
I know that Bill moves pretty
quickly so I think I've sort of

712
00:38:13,274 --> 00:38:17,011
violated my own rules there,
but I wasn't even...

713
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:18,579
I didn't even have rules then.

714
00:38:18,612 --> 00:38:23,150
Zombie purists sometimes
can get quite adamant

715
00:38:23,184 --> 00:38:24,885
about their feelings.

716
00:38:24,919 --> 00:38:31,292
I had a woman one time chastise
me for making my living

717
00:38:31,325 --> 00:38:37,598
in horror and not knowing
that zombies don't eat brains.

718
00:38:37,631 --> 00:38:40,534
These movies come out and we get
these like really particular

719
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:44,238
zombie enthusiasts that will rip
them apart on a message board.

720
00:38:44,271 --> 00:38:47,808
I'm like, come on guys,
it's a porno.

721
00:38:47,842 --> 00:38:50,978
S.G.: The zombie purists want
their zombies to be slow and

722
00:38:51,012 --> 00:38:54,248
shambling and I like to say that
they get kind of Dr. Seuss

723
00:38:54,281 --> 00:38:56,217
"Green Eggs and Ham"
about their zombies...

724
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,185
They do not like them when
they run, they do not like them

725
00:38:58,219 --> 00:39:00,087
when they're fun, they do not
like them with a heart,

726
00:39:00,121 --> 00:39:01,455
they do not like them
to be smart.

727
00:39:01,489 --> 00:39:04,892
They just want them to be slow
and shambling and mindless.

728
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:07,762
Fast zombies, slow zombies,
if zombies want to shoot lasers

729
00:39:07,795 --> 00:39:09,663
out of their eyes and
it works in the story,

730
00:39:09,697 --> 00:39:10,898
I think that's fantastic.

731
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:12,433
If you're a dead guy and you're
walking around, maybe you're

732
00:39:12,466 --> 00:39:14,769
eating people, maybe you're not
eating people, I don't know.

733
00:39:14,802 --> 00:39:17,371
If you're a dead guy walking
around, you're a zombie.

734
00:39:17,405 --> 00:39:20,408
For me, "28 Days Later" was
the first time I saw them

735
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:23,511
sped up and I just thought
that was genius.

736
00:39:23,544 --> 00:39:25,146
How did we not think
of this sooner?

737
00:39:25,179 --> 00:39:28,449
Zombies have been around forever
and no one has ever thought

738
00:39:28,482 --> 00:39:29,850
to just make them sprint.

739
00:39:29,884 --> 00:39:31,519
I mean, why wouldn't they?

740
00:39:31,552 --> 00:39:34,155
If they want the food,
they just fucking go get it.

741
00:39:34,188 --> 00:39:36,090
So that was truly terrifying.

742
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:39,193
I don't think there was anything
charming about those zombies.

743
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:41,929
Fuck fast zombies.

744
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:44,465
I fucking hate fast zombies.

745
00:39:44,498 --> 00:39:45,499
I hate them.

746
00:39:45,533 --> 00:39:48,502
Now "28 Days Later" --
not a zombie movie.

747
00:39:48,536 --> 00:39:53,707
Infection, those people were
infected, they aren't dead,

748
00:39:53,741 --> 00:39:56,177
so not a zombie movie,
just for the record.

749
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:58,479
Slow zombies don't cut it
for us often anymore.

750
00:39:58,512 --> 00:40:00,781
Our fears are more intense.

751
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,283
The world is faster.

752
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:03,884
Our technology is faster.

753
00:40:03,918 --> 00:40:07,221
We need a faster zombie and
I think a great example of it

754
00:40:07,254 --> 00:40:09,190
is bringing us all the way
up to the present day

755
00:40:09,223 --> 00:40:11,992
and the "World War Z" film
adaptation, where you see

756
00:40:12,026 --> 00:40:18,232
a virtual tsunami of zombie
bodies just rushing mindlessly,

757
00:40:18,265 --> 00:40:20,067
they're not even human anymore,

758
00:40:20,101 --> 00:40:22,436
they're not even distinguishable
as individuals.

759
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:27,441
They're just a mass of flesh
just washing over us.

760
00:40:27,475 --> 00:40:29,243
So I was asked to be
a scientific consultant

761
00:40:29,276 --> 00:40:30,945
on "World War Z."

762
00:40:30,978 --> 00:40:34,248
I had to remit to think
about zombies as if

763
00:40:34,281 --> 00:40:35,950
they were the product
of natural selection.

764
00:40:35,983 --> 00:40:39,120
If natural selection is at play,
we should expect to see very,

765
00:40:39,153 --> 00:40:40,488
very different things.

766
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,723
We should expect to see
cooperative behavior

767
00:40:42,756 --> 00:40:44,825
among zombies.

768
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:47,628
So before they get bitten,
they're individual humans

769
00:40:47,661 --> 00:40:50,564
with individual interests and
different genetic relatedness,

770
00:40:50,598 --> 00:40:52,099
so they should be selfish.

771
00:40:52,133 --> 00:40:55,569
Once they're bitten, it doesn't
matter which zombie bites

772
00:40:55,603 --> 00:40:59,039
the next human, so long as
the virus gets there.

773
00:40:59,073 --> 00:41:02,543
We see many examples in nature
of groups of organisms

774
00:41:02,576 --> 00:41:07,348
moving more quickly when the
individual desire is subjugated

775
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:09,884
to the success of the group.

776
00:41:14,922 --> 00:41:19,260
You know, the milestone in
zombie culture is the failure

777
00:41:19,293 --> 00:41:21,762
of the producer of
"Night of the Living Dead"

778
00:41:21,795 --> 00:41:25,332
to renew the copyright because
what that did is it put

779
00:41:25,366 --> 00:41:28,602
the picture in public domain and
meant that it was going to play

780
00:41:28,636 --> 00:41:34,642
on every cable TV station and
every midnight movie possible.

781
00:41:34,675 --> 00:41:38,779
Anybody who had a videotape of
that film could put it on

782
00:41:38,812 --> 00:41:41,882
their local television station
and play it on Halloween

783
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:45,152
or at midnight, and they did,
and so many other imitators

784
00:41:45,186 --> 00:41:48,422
came along and parody
filmmakers came along.

785
00:41:48,455 --> 00:41:50,591
Kill the brain,
kill the brain.

786
00:41:50,624 --> 00:41:51,692
Lock and load.

787
00:41:55,563 --> 00:41:57,998
And even great filmmakers
like David Cronenberg

788
00:41:58,032 --> 00:42:00,134
owe an enormous debt to Romero,

789
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:02,770
an enormous debt to the
"Night of the Living Dead."

790
00:42:02,803 --> 00:42:06,473
Zombies are definitely part
of mainstream culture now.

791
00:42:06,507 --> 00:42:08,309
I mean, there can hardly
be anybody left,

792
00:42:08,342 --> 00:42:10,744
at least in the
English speaking world,

793
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:14,148
who hasn't seen a
zombie movie by now.

794
00:42:14,181 --> 00:42:18,052
I think the advent of video
games and third-person

795
00:42:18,085 --> 00:42:21,088
shoot 'em up games
did more for the zombie genre

796
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:23,490
than a couple movies even.

797
00:42:23,524 --> 00:42:26,260
I mean, I bought a Sega just
so I could have one of those

798
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:29,897
shitty orange guns and
I could shoot at zombies.

799
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:31,632
Zombies have even infected
video games that are not

800
00:42:31,665 --> 00:42:32,933
zombie video games.

801
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:35,436
The "Call of Duty" franchise
is probably the most famous

802
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:38,072
which has banked through
its last few iterations

803
00:42:38,105 --> 00:42:40,941
on zombie mode as being
one of its big draws.

804
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:43,477
When zombies are so popular
that they're going to shoehorn

805
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:47,214
zombies into non-zombie games,
we know that we've reached

806
00:42:47,248 --> 00:42:51,385
a point of saturation in our
culture, triumph of the zombies.

807
00:42:51,418 --> 00:42:55,155
GEORGE: You could put on
"Sesame Street," a zombie,

808
00:42:55,189 --> 00:42:57,524
and kids would know what it was.

809
00:42:57,558 --> 00:43:00,527
Kids would know what it was,
a zombie, oh yeah.

810
00:43:00,561 --> 00:43:04,398
Zombies don't eat meat
because they can't have meat.

811
00:43:04,431 --> 00:43:06,367
They only eat your brains.

812
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,102
When they eat your brains,

813
00:43:08,135 --> 00:43:13,907
the human brains
come in their brains.

814
00:43:13,941 --> 00:43:16,210
STEVEN: So in the last probably
two and a half, three years,

815
00:43:16,243 --> 00:43:19,980
they've gone from an underground
rabid cult following --

816
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:22,516
people love them --
to this huge pop culture

817
00:43:22,549 --> 00:43:23,584
mainstream following.

818
00:43:23,617 --> 00:43:25,119
You just got to put the word
zombie on something

819
00:43:25,152 --> 00:43:26,587
and it sells.

820
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:28,856
What if say technically
you were not alive,

821
00:43:28,889 --> 00:43:31,258
like maybe you
were undead?

822
00:43:31,292 --> 00:43:32,393
Like a zombie?

823
00:43:32,426 --> 00:43:34,795
Whoa, let's not go
putting labels on people.

824
00:43:37,398 --> 00:43:38,732
I'm a zombie.

825
00:43:38,766 --> 00:43:40,367
I'm here to tell you
how to best prepare

826
00:43:40,401 --> 00:43:42,169
for the zombie apocalypse.

827
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:44,438
Don't be afraid to
bash our heads in.

828
00:43:44,471 --> 00:43:49,677
We could easily be taken out
with a well-thrown rock...

829
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:52,546
or a two-by-four.

830
00:43:52,579 --> 00:43:54,848
You want to know the best way
to survive the apocalypse?

831
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:58,085
Get the right health insurance.

832
00:43:58,118 --> 00:44:00,921
This interview with a zombie
brought to you by the good folks

833
00:44:00,954 --> 00:44:03,324
at Rocky Mountain Health Plans.

834
00:44:03,357 --> 00:44:06,260
You see them in commercials now,
you see them in movie

835
00:44:06,293 --> 00:44:09,330
theatre ads, I mean,
zombies are everywhere, man.

836
00:44:09,363 --> 00:44:12,099
You want to talk about when is
the zombie apocalypse coming?

837
00:44:12,132 --> 00:44:13,567
It's here.

838
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,636
No! It's Zombie-Con weekend!

839
00:44:15,669 --> 00:44:17,438
(screaming)

840
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,475
There's got to be
more of us out there.

841
00:44:25,012 --> 00:44:27,348
No! No!

842
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:34,822
The number one show on cable
that beat our show,

843
00:44:34,855 --> 00:44:38,225
"Burn Notice," which was
the number one show on cable,

844
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:39,893
is zombies.

845
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:53,340
How we got to be so
popular is blind luck.

846
00:44:53,374 --> 00:44:55,309
It's as simple as that.

847
00:44:55,342 --> 00:45:00,114
Somehow we managed to tap in
on some sort of public zeitgeist

848
00:45:00,147 --> 00:45:05,853
that wanted this sort of product
at that sort of time.

849
00:45:05,886 --> 00:45:09,523
I'll meet somebody on the street
and a guy will come up and say,

850
00:45:09,556 --> 00:45:12,259
oh my God, I love "The Walking
Dead," stay right here,

851
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:15,529
and he'll run over and he'll
bring his wife over and his wife

852
00:45:15,562 --> 00:45:19,233
will be more excited about
"The Walking Dead" than he is!

853
00:45:19,266 --> 00:45:20,868
I've always been uncomfortable
with the success of

854
00:45:20,901 --> 00:45:22,302
"The Walking Dead."

855
00:45:22,336 --> 00:45:25,706
When it debuted as a comic, it
was like, oh wait, this thing is

856
00:45:25,739 --> 00:45:28,675
way more popular than it should
be and it just kept getting more

857
00:45:28,709 --> 00:45:31,378
and more popular and then when
the show happened, I honestly

858
00:45:31,412 --> 00:45:33,947
didn't think the show was
going to be successful at all.

859
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,816
I was hoping and praying
that the show would be

860
00:45:35,849 --> 00:45:38,452
just successful enough
to continue.

861
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:41,221
It honestly makes no
sense to me whatsoever.

862
00:45:41,255 --> 00:45:44,291
I don't know how this show
is as popular as it is.

863
00:45:45,893 --> 00:45:49,396
They're joining the ranks of
the blockbuster pop culture

864
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:52,766
icons, like superheroes
and action heroes.

865
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,935
S.G.: Werewolves are kind of
like the jocks of monsters.

866
00:45:54,968 --> 00:45:57,204
They're full of testosterone
and sprouting hair all over

867
00:45:57,237 --> 00:46:01,175
the place and full of rage and
screaming and running around.

868
00:46:01,208 --> 00:46:04,111
Vampires are kind of
like the fraternity boys.

869
00:46:04,144 --> 00:46:07,548
They're always sort of suave and
slick and trying to convince you

870
00:46:07,581 --> 00:46:11,051
to get into bed with them
so they can drink your blood,

871
00:46:11,084 --> 00:46:13,220
and zombies are kind of like
the nerds and the geeks,

872
00:46:13,253 --> 00:46:15,756
you know, they don't
get the girls,

873
00:46:15,789 --> 00:46:17,891
but they don't have
any ulterior motives.

874
00:46:17,925 --> 00:46:19,226
They wear their emotions
on their sleeves.

875
00:46:19,259 --> 00:46:21,228
They say, I am a zombie and
I want to eat your brains.

876
00:46:21,261 --> 00:46:24,064
It's a monster that's
completely honest.

877
00:46:24,097 --> 00:46:29,670
A vampire seduces, a zombie
feeds, a zombie goes after you,

878
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,638
and some people,
they're turned on by that.

879
00:46:31,672 --> 00:46:33,574
They're turned on by
relentless desire.

880
00:46:33,607 --> 00:46:35,943
They want to be desired
like nothing else.

881
00:46:35,976 --> 00:46:39,646
You know, nobody wants to be
raped in real life but a lot of

882
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,916
people have rape fantasies
and sex with the zombie

883
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:44,551
is probably the ultimate rape.

884
00:46:47,287 --> 00:46:49,456
Shit, another walker.

885
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:51,925
Don't worry,
I got this one.

886
00:46:51,959 --> 00:46:55,095
No Glenn, put
your dick away.

887
00:46:55,128 --> 00:46:58,465
It is tough to make a zombie
porn because you kind of

888
00:46:58,499 --> 00:47:04,404
have to violate every law of
porn and then you're also,

889
00:47:04,438 --> 00:47:07,608
at the same time, violating
all these zombie laws.

890
00:47:09,309 --> 00:47:10,978
It's been some day,
hasn't it, son?

891
00:47:11,011 --> 00:47:12,246
Yeah.

892
00:47:12,279 --> 00:47:15,749
You got lost and then united,
had a threesome with your mom

893
00:47:15,782 --> 00:47:17,784
and my best friend.

894
00:47:17,818 --> 00:47:22,356
Now Carl, I've got to know,
do you have it in you to go over

895
00:47:22,389 --> 00:47:26,627
there and fuck that girl,
and kill her with your cum?

896
00:47:28,362 --> 00:47:30,230
JOANNA: "Walking Dead"
definitely sold the most

897
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:33,534
out of probably any other porno
we've ever made.

898
00:47:35,802 --> 00:47:39,673
People love playing the role and
I think it is also an element

899
00:47:39,706 --> 00:47:43,610
of domesticating it,
making it safer, making it fun.

900
00:47:43,644 --> 00:47:44,811
Zombie culture has
really blossomed.

901
00:47:44,845 --> 00:47:47,848
You have zombie walks or
zombie crawls, if you prefer,

902
00:47:47,881 --> 00:47:51,585
zombie runs, zombie fashion
shows, zombie beauty shows,

903
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:53,787
zombie weddings,
zombie engagements,

904
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:57,524
zombie birthday parties,
zombie car washes.

905
00:47:57,558 --> 00:48:00,193
I would never have let
a zombie wash my car.

906
00:48:00,227 --> 00:48:01,929
(laughter)

907
00:48:04,064 --> 00:48:06,233
Are you ready to
meet your maker?

908
00:48:06,266 --> 00:48:07,901
You're not gonna because
you're gonna come back

909
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:10,337
to be a flesh eating beast!

910
00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:12,839
Are you ready?

911
00:48:12,873 --> 00:48:15,242
Get ready to tread or die today!

912
00:48:15,275 --> 00:48:21,848
Runners, take your mark,
set, banzai!

913
00:48:21,882 --> 00:48:23,517
Suckers!

914
00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:33,594
♪

915
00:48:33,594 --> 00:48:40,867
♪

916
00:48:40,901 --> 00:48:43,170
I made it! I made it!
I made it! I made it!

917
00:48:50,944 --> 00:48:56,550
I was coming to the first annual
Seattle Zombie-Con and a couple

918
00:48:56,583 --> 00:48:58,518
approached me who were
going to the convention.

919
00:48:58,552 --> 00:49:06,259
They wanted to be married by me
as zombies, and I'm like,

920
00:49:06,293 --> 00:49:10,197
"But you want this
to count, right?"

921
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:12,633
And I thought, you know,
their poor family.

922
00:49:12,666 --> 00:49:15,268
This is a sacred thing,
getting married, you know?

923
00:49:15,302 --> 00:49:18,271
And they're doing this as
zombies and getting the idiot

924
00:49:18,305 --> 00:49:23,844
guy who played Ash to marry them
but then you see their family!

925
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:26,647
Who gives this zombie woman
to be married to

926
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:29,316
this lucky zombie man?

927
00:49:29,349 --> 00:49:30,584
(growling)

928
00:49:30,617 --> 00:49:35,188
Alright, dad,
go take a nap.

929
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:38,291
The father couldn't sit down
because he came as a guy who had

930
00:49:38,325 --> 00:49:44,164
a spike that had impaled him and
all the family came as zombies.

931
00:49:44,197 --> 00:49:47,234
Zombies don't think
about what they're doing,

932
00:49:47,267 --> 00:49:50,404
they just do it.

933
00:49:50,437 --> 00:49:52,172
Am I right, zombies?

934
00:49:52,205 --> 00:49:53,840
(cheering)

935
00:49:53,874 --> 00:49:55,976
Come on, you freaks!

936
00:49:56,009 --> 00:49:57,844
Now shut up,
I'm still talking.

937
00:49:57,878 --> 00:50:00,847
Anybody needs zombies married,
I guess I'm your go-to guy,

938
00:50:00,881 --> 00:50:03,617
but I've only performed one
because they're going to get

939
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:07,654
really expensive now because
it's just too weird.

940
00:50:09,856 --> 00:50:13,326
Zombie fans, I think,
are, I don't know,

941
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:16,830
I can't identify
who zombie fans are.

942
00:50:16,863 --> 00:50:18,532
Who are zombie fans?

943
00:50:18,565 --> 00:50:20,634
Are they fans of the genre?

944
00:50:20,667 --> 00:50:22,436
Are they fans of horror movies?

945
00:50:22,469 --> 00:50:25,906
All these people that come out
for zombie walks, what is it?

946
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:30,811
What is it that
appeals to zombie fans?

947
00:50:30,844 --> 00:50:34,147
I think that anyone that made
"Dawn of the Dead" would have to

948
00:50:34,181 --> 00:50:37,984
understand what zombie
culture is about.

949
00:50:38,018 --> 00:50:40,754
There is so much in that movie
that's just about humans

950
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:42,556
and human nature.

951
00:50:42,589 --> 00:50:47,861
You have to know, like,
you have to see that.

952
00:50:47,894 --> 00:50:48,495
I don't know.

953
00:50:48,528 --> 00:50:50,063
That doesn't make sense.

954
00:50:50,097 --> 00:50:51,898
Don't put that in there.

955
00:50:51,932 --> 00:50:54,067
(laughter)

956
00:50:54,101 --> 00:50:57,270
TOM: I've seen a crowd of people
go into the middle of a square

957
00:50:57,304 --> 00:51:01,007
as zombies and then all of
a sudden, "Thriller" will blast

958
00:51:01,041 --> 00:51:02,342
and they all do
the "Thriller" dance,

959
00:51:02,375 --> 00:51:07,080
that I would like to participate
in, but not the zombie walk.

960
00:51:07,114 --> 00:51:08,782
I don't get it,
I'm sorry.

961
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:11,084
Well done to you people
dressed as zombies.

962
00:51:11,118 --> 00:51:13,353
Good for you.

963
00:51:13,386 --> 00:51:14,488
I don't get it.

964
00:51:14,521 --> 00:51:17,324
That would be like me dressing
up as someone with Ebola.

965
00:51:17,357 --> 00:51:19,593
(laughter)

966
00:51:19,626 --> 00:51:20,861
It'd be like, come on.

967
00:51:20,894 --> 00:51:23,563
There's going to be 16,000
people in Denver all walking,

968
00:51:23,597 --> 00:51:25,832
pretending that they have
testicular cancer, come on!

969
00:51:25,866 --> 00:51:27,200
(laughter)

970
00:51:27,234 --> 00:51:29,503
WOMAN: It's nothing new
that zombies walk,

971
00:51:29,536 --> 00:51:30,737
that's just what they do.

972
00:51:30,771 --> 00:51:33,507
And I never say that anyone
ever invented the zombie walk

973
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:38,411
because that's their kind of
monster character.

974
00:51:38,445 --> 00:51:40,747
I think maybe the very first
time I ever dressed up as

975
00:51:40,781 --> 00:51:44,751
a zombie was for the first
annual Denver Zombie Crawl.

976
00:51:44,785 --> 00:51:47,687
There's probably like 15
or 20 people, and I was like,

977
00:51:47,721 --> 00:51:50,824
God, this is so cool!
What a great idea.

978
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:53,593
We're all going to dress like
zombies and pound on the windows

979
00:51:53,627 --> 00:51:56,062
while people are eating dinner
and this is the coolest thing

980
00:51:56,096 --> 00:51:58,965
ever, and then the next year,
it was like, oh my God,

981
00:51:58,999 --> 00:52:01,902
there's like 50, 75 people --
cool!

982
00:52:01,935 --> 00:52:05,205
And then the next year,
it was hundreds and I think

983
00:52:05,238 --> 00:52:08,775
last year was 15
or 17,000 people --

984
00:52:08,809 --> 00:52:12,145
families, professionals,
children.

985
00:52:12,179 --> 00:52:14,748
It's amazing.

986
00:52:14,781 --> 00:52:17,651
It's a punk thing,
it's almost punk, right?

987
00:52:17,684 --> 00:52:20,320
Making a statement, saying,
I don't want to be part of

988
00:52:20,353 --> 00:52:22,556
this life, I'll be
a part of that life,

989
00:52:22,589 --> 00:52:24,524
but I don't want to be
a part of this life.

990
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:27,260
I think that's
really what it is.

991
00:52:27,294 --> 00:52:29,496
It's frustration, man.

992
00:52:29,529 --> 00:52:30,897
SARAH:
I mean, it's all in good fun.

993
00:52:30,931 --> 00:52:33,533
It's play, but I feel like
underneath that is a little bit

994
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:36,603
of danger and there's a message
that's being sent that says,

995
00:52:36,636 --> 00:52:40,674
you know, if we wanted to, we
have the capacity to organize.

996
00:52:40,707 --> 00:52:44,144
Here we just got 10,000 zombies
out in this public square

997
00:52:44,177 --> 00:52:47,447
so I felt like it's a kind of
tacit message to our government.

998
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,683
DR. BLOCK: If you're into
zombies, the zombie walk

999
00:52:49,716 --> 00:52:51,117
is like date night.

1000
00:52:51,151 --> 00:52:53,286
If you're dressed as a zombie,
sometimes that helps,

1001
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:56,456
especially if you're a
little looks challenged.

1002
00:52:56,489 --> 00:52:59,359
It's very liberating to
be purposefully ugly.

1003
00:52:59,392 --> 00:53:01,094
You can let your Id out.

1004
00:53:01,127 --> 00:53:03,964
WOMAN: I do think corpses
are a little bit attractive.

1005
00:53:03,997 --> 00:53:05,632
I was sitting next
to one earlier

1006
00:53:05,665 --> 00:53:08,101
and I'm going to tell you,
he was pretty handsome.

1007
00:53:08,134 --> 00:53:09,302
I liked holding his hand.

1008
00:53:09,336 --> 00:53:12,973
He was big, kind of buff,
even though he was bony.

1009
00:53:13,006 --> 00:53:15,575
I think people are thinking
too hard these days about,

1010
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:17,711
"Whoa, what's this
zombie phenomenon?"

1011
00:53:17,744 --> 00:53:20,914
People love to dress up, they
love to be other characters,

1012
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:22,949
they love to escape
from themselves.

1013
00:53:22,983 --> 00:53:26,086
The costumes are amazing,
they're cinematic,

1014
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:27,254
there's incredible gore.

1015
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:29,689
There's incredible creativity.

1016
00:53:29,723 --> 00:53:33,460
Where else can you
see a Lego zombie?

1017
00:53:33,493 --> 00:53:35,629
I don't know why people
come out and do it.

1018
00:53:35,662 --> 00:53:39,866
I have to pay union wages
to get them to come.

1019
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:44,838
(laughter and applause)

1020
00:53:44,871 --> 00:53:46,539
I think it's about
getting connected again.

1021
00:53:46,573 --> 00:53:48,475
It's so interesting to me,
like, I see these zombie walks

1022
00:53:48,508 --> 00:53:51,778
and nobody is tweeting
or emailing or texting.

1023
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:53,580
They're actually talking to
each other and I know that

1024
00:53:53,613 --> 00:53:55,382
sounds a little too peace
and love and all that,

1025
00:53:55,415 --> 00:53:57,784
but it actually reminds me --
I used to follow Grateful Dead

1026
00:53:57,817 --> 00:54:00,320
around when I was in college
and it reminds me the most

1027
00:54:00,353 --> 00:54:01,588
of a Grateful Dead show.

1028
00:54:01,621 --> 00:54:03,623
Not in the way that people are
checked out, but in the way that

1029
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,158
people are actually
nice to each other.

1030
00:54:05,191 --> 00:54:06,660
That doesn't happen very often.

1031
00:54:06,693 --> 00:54:09,229
It doesn't happen at a ballgame,
but it happens when people

1032
00:54:09,262 --> 00:54:12,165
dress up like the walking dead
and walk down the street.

1033
00:54:13,433 --> 00:54:16,036
KYLE: Sometimes it's more fun
to watch the audience

1034
00:54:16,069 --> 00:54:19,072
than the participants because
whether they know it or not,

1035
00:54:19,105 --> 00:54:21,942
the audience just
became participants.

1036
00:54:21,975 --> 00:54:24,344
The great thing about the zombie
is, you get bit by a zombie,

1037
00:54:24,377 --> 00:54:27,013
then you're one of them and
you're part of this collective,

1038
00:54:27,047 --> 00:54:28,448
you're part of this hoard.

1039
00:54:28,481 --> 00:54:31,318
Well, zombie fandom
works the same way.

1040
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:32,953
I think that's kind of
the cool thing that's coming

1041
00:54:32,986 --> 00:54:34,154
from all of this.

1042
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:38,158
Maybe people are getting a
skinned knee when they're doing

1043
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:40,860
the zombie obstacle course,
but they're having fun,

1044
00:54:40,894 --> 00:54:43,663
they're having a good time,
so to a very small degree,

1045
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,799
they're improving
people's lives.

1046
00:54:45,832 --> 00:54:47,801
(laughing)

1047
00:55:05,819 --> 00:55:08,321
Bravo 2 to Bravo 1,
switch has been pulled.

1048
00:55:08,355 --> 00:55:10,824
Any change in
situation upstairs?

1049
00:55:10,857 --> 00:55:13,693
<i>That is a negative</i>.

1050
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:15,996
<i>Carry on your search, over</i>.

1051
00:55:16,029 --> 00:55:20,567
Keep looking down
there, gentlemen.

1052
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,268
(gunshot)

1053
00:55:22,302 --> 00:55:24,170
Bravo 2 to Bravo 1...

1054
00:55:24,204 --> 00:55:26,106
(screaming)

1055
00:55:29,376 --> 00:55:31,578
Bravo 2 to Bravo 1,
come in, over.

1056
00:55:31,611 --> 00:55:34,681
<i>Bravo 1 to Bravo 2,
get your ass up here now</i>!

1057
00:55:34,714 --> 00:55:37,851
Move! Let's go!

1058
00:55:37,884 --> 00:55:40,754
Stay low, watch your heads.

1059
00:55:40,787 --> 00:55:43,690
Single file up the
stairs, gentleman.

1060
00:55:43,723 --> 00:55:45,558
Guys, I need two eyes
on this doorway behind me.

1061
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:47,727
Make sure it's clear.

1062
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:49,596
Holy shit!

1063
00:55:49,629 --> 00:55:51,931
What the fuck is that?

1064
00:55:51,965 --> 00:55:54,801
The armor that that thing
has got built into it

1065
00:55:54,834 --> 00:55:56,336
will take a 50 caliber.

1066
00:55:56,369 --> 00:55:59,305
Our shotguns are gonna
do dick and squat.

1067
00:55:59,339 --> 00:56:03,610
Anything happens, you go
there as fast as you can.

1068
00:56:03,643 --> 00:56:05,478
No dicking around, yeah?

1069
00:56:05,512 --> 00:56:14,487
♪

1070
00:56:14,521 --> 00:56:16,790
Move!

1071
00:56:16,823 --> 00:56:20,994
(screaming)

1072
00:56:21,027 --> 00:56:23,530
This is an event where we
provide a total immersive

1073
00:56:23,563 --> 00:56:24,864
zombie experience.

1074
00:56:24,898 --> 00:56:26,266
From the minute they
arrive at the event,

1075
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:29,035
they are thrown into basically
a narrative storyline.

1076
00:56:29,069 --> 00:56:32,172
Everyone's got an idea
of how they would handle

1077
00:56:32,205 --> 00:56:33,573
a zombie apocalypse.

1078
00:56:33,606 --> 00:56:35,408
We're giving people the
opportunity to try that out.

1079
00:56:35,442 --> 00:56:36,976
(screaming)

1080
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:43,850
MAX: "The Zombie Survival Guide"
came about during the Y2K scare

1081
00:56:43,883 --> 00:56:45,085
of the late '90s.

1082
00:56:45,118 --> 00:56:47,787
That was a time when people were
starting to prepare for this

1083
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:52,826
sort of nebulous apocalypse that
they didn't really understand.

1084
00:56:52,859 --> 00:56:55,862
America specifically had been
experiencing the largest

1085
00:56:55,895 --> 00:56:59,132
post-war boom in its history
and times were good, but there

1086
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:03,703
was this feeling that times were
about to change and all these

1087
00:57:03,736 --> 00:57:07,407
survival guides were coming out
and I noticed that none of them

1088
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,909
were addressing my fears.

1089
00:57:09,943 --> 00:57:13,580
Granted, zombies are not real,
but that certainly didn't stop

1090
00:57:13,613 --> 00:57:15,782
anybody else from publishing
survival guides about all

1091
00:57:15,815 --> 00:57:18,118
the other things that were going
to happen that were not real.

1092
00:57:18,151 --> 00:57:21,154
Zombie movies are essentially
disaster movies and I think

1093
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:25,125
there has been a sense from 9/11
on, that the system is breaking

1094
00:57:25,158 --> 00:57:28,795
down, and we want to know what
the end game is psychologically.

1095
00:57:28,828 --> 00:57:31,297
We want to know what is all this
leading to and the problem is

1096
00:57:31,331 --> 00:57:35,368
if you watch a movie where the
catalyst for that disaster is

1097
00:57:35,401 --> 00:57:38,371
real, like a real nuclear war
or a real plague or a real

1098
00:57:38,404 --> 00:57:41,141
global financial meltdown,
you will not sleep that night.

1099
00:57:41,174 --> 00:57:45,211
So if the catalyst is something
like zombies, then you can say,

1100
00:57:45,245 --> 00:57:47,614
oh wow, look, neighbors are
stabbing each other and there

1101
00:57:47,647 --> 00:57:49,983
are no services and FEMA is
incompetent and the president

1102
00:57:50,016 --> 00:57:51,951
is flying over going,
"That's peculiar."

1103
00:57:51,985 --> 00:57:53,386
(laughter)

1104
00:57:53,419 --> 00:57:55,655
But it's zombies,
so that's totally okay

1105
00:57:55,688 --> 00:57:56,756
and then I'm going
to go to sleep.

1106
00:58:03,196 --> 00:58:04,664
What would be your first
order of business

1107
00:58:04,697 --> 00:58:06,166
in a zombie apocalypse?

1108
00:58:06,199 --> 00:58:08,868
Find some place that's fortified
that I can control what comes in

1109
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:11,404
and what comes out
because if I can stop them

1110
00:58:11,437 --> 00:58:13,840
before they even come in...

1111
00:58:13,873 --> 00:58:16,876
Would it be a boat?
What do you think?

1112
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,344
I don't know, never
thought about the boat.

1113
00:58:18,378 --> 00:58:19,512
You've got to think
about these things.

1114
00:58:19,546 --> 00:58:20,580
Right.

1115
00:58:20,613 --> 00:58:22,882
Everyone has their chance
today to be prepared.

1116
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:24,584
You make the choice now
whether you're going to be

1117
00:58:24,617 --> 00:58:26,452
prepped to live
or prepped to die.

1118
00:58:26,486 --> 00:58:29,322
Top five things that you would
suggest people prioritize

1119
00:58:29,355 --> 00:58:31,090
when they're
creating a prep kit.

1120
00:58:31,124 --> 00:58:33,626
Water purification and
filtration equipment,

1121
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:37,530
first aid if you get injured,
security hugely important,

1122
00:58:37,564 --> 00:58:43,069
shelter and warmth,
and shortwave radio, ham radio.

1123
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:45,338
What is your motto at
Atlas Survival Shelters?

1124
00:58:45,371 --> 00:58:47,440
Better prepared than scared.

1125
00:58:47,473 --> 00:58:51,444
I build long-term survival
shelters for private individuals

1126
00:58:51,477 --> 00:58:53,513
so that their family
has a chance to survive

1127
00:58:53,546 --> 00:58:55,148
what's coming
down the road.

1128
00:58:55,181 --> 00:58:56,616
And is something
coming down the road?

1129
00:58:56,649 --> 00:58:58,351
I believe something is
coming down the road.

1130
00:58:58,384 --> 00:58:59,719
a lot of people do.

1131
00:58:59,752 --> 00:59:00,954
What would you say
if somebody said that

1132
00:59:00,987 --> 00:59:02,589
one of those threats
was zombies?

1133
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:03,690
Say that again.

1134
00:59:03,723 --> 00:59:05,692
What would you say if one of
those threats was zombies?

1135
00:59:05,725 --> 00:59:06,759
What if they're fast?

1136
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:09,229
If they're fast, you could
spend upwards of $10,000.

1137
00:59:09,262 --> 00:59:11,464
So you're fucked
if they're fast.

1138
00:59:11,497 --> 00:59:15,034
Yeah...
you're fucked.

1139
00:59:15,068 --> 00:59:18,004
Your shelters are nuclear,
biological, and chemical class

1140
00:59:18,037 --> 00:59:21,174
survival shelters,
but are they zombie proof?

1141
00:59:21,207 --> 00:59:22,775
From the television zombies?

1142
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:23,876
Yeah, are your
shelters --

1143
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:26,079
From the television zombies,
they're zombie proof,

1144
00:59:26,112 --> 00:59:27,347
100 percent.

1145
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:32,518
There are people who
are always asking me,

1146
00:59:32,552 --> 00:59:35,021
do you have a zombie
survival plan?

1147
00:59:35,054 --> 00:59:36,522
And I'm like, no,
I live in San Francisco.

1148
00:59:36,556 --> 00:59:38,258
I don't even have an
earthquake survival kit,

1149
00:59:38,291 --> 00:59:40,159
so I'm not exactly on
Darwin's short list

1150
00:59:40,193 --> 00:59:42,028
for making it through this.

1151
00:59:42,061 --> 00:59:45,064
I always think getting to the
attic would be a good thing to

1152
00:59:45,098 --> 00:59:49,235
do because they can't climb and
you could lift up the ladder

1153
00:59:49,269 --> 00:59:50,603
and they wouldn't know you were
up there if you were real quiet

1154
00:59:50,637 --> 00:59:52,205
but you're going
to starve to death.

1155
00:59:52,238 --> 00:59:53,473
People make noise.

1156
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:57,377
I've got a little girl now and
I can't keep her quiet anywhere,

1157
00:59:57,410 --> 01:00:00,380
let alone in an attic
in a house full of zombies,

1158
01:00:00,413 --> 01:00:03,483
so I think you'd have to get up,
I think you'd go north.

1159
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:08,554
Once I'm sure that civilization
is as screwed up as, you know,

1160
01:00:08,588 --> 01:00:11,224
it would be in
a zombie apocalypse,

1161
01:00:11,257 --> 01:00:13,126
I would jump off
the tallest building.

1162
01:00:13,159 --> 01:00:14,594
I don't want to live like that.

1163
01:00:14,627 --> 01:00:16,296
I don't like being hungry.

1164
01:00:16,329 --> 01:00:17,497
You ever been hungry?

1165
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:18,731
It's not fun.

1166
01:00:18,765 --> 01:00:21,100
I would hang on as long as I
thought I could protect my wife

1167
01:00:21,134 --> 01:00:25,471
and kids, and then once that
didn't pan out because

1168
01:00:25,505 --> 01:00:29,575
I'm pretty sure it wouldn't
pan out, then I would go.

1169
01:00:29,609 --> 01:00:34,247
I think I would just have to
run away and call my children

1170
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:37,150
and wish them luck.

1171
01:00:37,183 --> 01:00:39,118
Do the best you can
where you are.

1172
01:00:39,152 --> 01:00:40,620
I'll do what I can where I am.

1173
01:00:40,653 --> 01:00:41,921
I ain't coming to get you.

1174
01:00:41,954 --> 01:00:44,557
Sorry dude, you had a good life.

1175
01:00:44,590 --> 01:00:48,094
(laughing)

1176
01:00:48,127 --> 01:00:50,463
I love my family more than
Bruce Campbell loves his family,

1177
01:00:50,496 --> 01:00:51,531
it's official.

1178
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:54,067
I'm not a very good shot,
I certainly can't shoot

1179
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:56,235
a crossbow, I'm not
a very good fisherman.

1180
01:00:56,269 --> 01:00:58,037
I would be like Homer.

1181
01:00:58,071 --> 01:01:00,506
Homer was blind and wandered
around a really dangerous

1182
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:03,009
landscape with a bunch of futile
lords and somehow stayed alive

1183
01:01:03,042 --> 01:01:04,777
by telling people stories and
was smart enough never to

1184
01:01:04,811 --> 01:01:05,945
have them end, right?

1185
01:01:05,978 --> 01:01:07,547
Because if then ended,
then they'd kill him.

1186
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:12,452
I would drive here, I would
do zombie makeup on myself

1187
01:01:12,485 --> 01:01:16,189
and then just walk around.

1188
01:01:16,222 --> 01:01:20,693
The only problem would be if
some dude with a shotgun saw me,

1189
01:01:20,727 --> 01:01:22,061
he'd shoot me in the head
and then it would kind of

1190
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:23,496
defeat the purpose.

1191
01:01:23,529 --> 01:01:25,665
Are zombies on the news coming?
Did I miss something?

1192
01:01:25,698 --> 01:01:28,668
Are zombies walking
up and down my alley

1193
01:01:28,701 --> 01:01:30,370
and I need to be ready for them?

1194
01:01:30,403 --> 01:01:33,506
I'm sure you've seen examples
of people where there is

1195
01:01:33,539 --> 01:01:37,477
no separation and this is
something that's real to them.

1196
01:01:37,510 --> 01:01:38,945
Wrestling is real to them!

1197
01:01:38,978 --> 01:01:40,346
What's up Zed Heads?

1198
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:42,615
The zombie apocalypse is coming
whether you like it or not.

1199
01:01:42,648 --> 01:01:45,351
It's not a matter of if, it's
a matter of when, and our homies

1200
01:01:45,385 --> 01:01:47,320
at Zombie Industries are
going to help us prepare.

1201
01:01:47,353 --> 01:01:49,355
They've got the bleeding targets
that you can use

1202
01:01:49,389 --> 01:01:52,358
to armor yourself up
and protect your family.

1203
01:01:52,392 --> 01:01:54,527
Here at Zombie Industries,
we're going to teach you firearm

1204
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:57,797
safety, hand-to-hand combat,
and how to put a bullet

1205
01:01:57,830 --> 01:02:01,534
right through a zombie's brain
because it's your patriotic duty

1206
01:02:01,567 --> 01:02:04,237
to prepare yourself
for the zombie hoards.

1207
01:02:04,270 --> 01:02:07,707
It's the end of the world
and I feel fine.

1208
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:09,642
We're going to
train you up solid.

1209
01:02:09,675 --> 01:02:11,310
Ladies, show them what you got!

1210
01:02:11,344 --> 01:02:14,847
(yelling)

1211
01:02:14,881 --> 01:02:17,150
We're coming for you, zombies!

1212
01:02:22,622 --> 01:02:25,425
We understand that it's not
a matter of if the zombies come,

1213
01:02:25,458 --> 01:02:27,627
but more of a matter of when
and when they do,

1214
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:29,061
we want people to be ready.

1215
01:02:29,095 --> 01:02:31,831
We're all about preparedness
here and it really is

1216
01:02:31,864 --> 01:02:34,534
something that we think
is a family activity.

1217
01:02:34,567 --> 01:02:36,335
Everybody in the house
should be prepared

1218
01:02:36,369 --> 01:02:37,570
for when the zombies come.

1219
01:02:37,603 --> 01:02:40,173
We really want to instill
for our customers to actually

1220
01:02:40,206 --> 01:02:43,042
have an avenue basically to
come out and give them products

1221
01:02:43,075 --> 01:02:44,243
to train with.

1222
01:02:44,277 --> 01:02:47,280
Our targets basically have
been shot in testing up to

1223
01:02:47,313 --> 01:02:49,649
about 2500 times,
maybe a little bit more.

1224
01:02:49,682 --> 01:02:51,651
We've shot them with everything
from a .22 all the way up to

1225
01:02:51,684 --> 01:02:54,320
a 50 BMG, so anything
you want to throw at it.

1226
01:02:54,353 --> 01:02:57,723
All of our bleeding targets have
500 individual cells of blood

1227
01:02:57,757 --> 01:03:00,526
inside distributed through the
center mass and through the face

1228
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:02,462
so it's not one large bladder
where you shoot it once

1229
01:03:02,495 --> 01:03:04,230
and everything runs out
and the fun's over.

1230
01:03:04,263 --> 01:03:07,099
Our targets are designed
to last all day.

1231
01:03:07,133 --> 01:03:09,535
Firearm safety is
a very serious thing.

1232
01:03:09,569 --> 01:03:11,571
When you start talking about
shooting three-dimensional

1233
01:03:11,604 --> 01:03:15,241
realistic human beings,
people get uneasy about that,

1234
01:03:15,274 --> 01:03:17,877
but as soon as you make it
a zombie, then it's okay.

1235
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:20,446
We came out with
the Chris zombie,

1236
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,448
who is the quintessential
zombie.

1237
01:03:22,482 --> 01:03:25,418
He still, to this day, remains
our number one seller.

1238
01:03:25,451 --> 01:03:28,120
We did quickly move into
the terrorist and the Nazi.

1239
01:03:28,154 --> 01:03:29,655
Zombies don't really
discriminate

1240
01:03:29,689 --> 01:03:31,524
so we came out with
an ex-girlfriend.

1241
01:03:31,557 --> 01:03:34,093
When people ask us all the
time, how do you have a female

1242
01:03:34,126 --> 01:03:37,196
shooting target and I have to
tell them, look, if it comes

1243
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:39,365
right down to it, if my
mother becomes a zombie,

1244
01:03:39,398 --> 01:03:41,968
it's going to break my heart,
but I'm not going to hesitate.

1245
01:03:42,001 --> 01:03:43,569
I'm going to have
to double tap her.

1246
01:03:43,603 --> 01:03:47,073
When the zombie apocalypse
arrives, will you survive?

1247
01:03:47,106 --> 01:03:49,175
Zombie go boom!

1248
01:03:49,208 --> 01:03:52,545
Kick undead ass!

1249
01:03:52,578 --> 01:03:56,082
The USA-made Ka-Bar Zombie
Killer Swabbie was created

1250
01:03:56,115 --> 01:04:00,319
to ensure you are prepared in
the most extreme of situations.

1251
01:04:13,566 --> 01:04:14,967
Holy shit!

1252
01:04:16,302 --> 01:04:17,837
Holy shit!

1253
01:04:17,870 --> 01:04:20,506
I didn't know if that was
actually a possibility

1254
01:04:20,540 --> 01:04:24,043
to take somebody's face off.

1255
01:04:24,076 --> 01:04:28,180
The layers are ridiculous,
crystal skull, extremely hard.

1256
01:04:28,214 --> 01:04:30,416
The crystal skull is actually
probably harder than

1257
01:04:30,449 --> 01:04:32,451
a human skull and
this was just easy.

1258
01:04:36,389 --> 01:04:37,456
How easy was that?

1259
01:04:37,490 --> 01:04:39,892
That was just as easy
as the first strike.

1260
01:04:39,926 --> 01:04:41,394
ZGB approved!

1261
01:04:41,427 --> 01:04:45,064
Oh my God!

1262
01:04:45,097 --> 01:04:47,033
Calm down,
it's okay.

1263
01:04:47,066 --> 01:04:48,200
I love that thing!

1264
01:04:49,168 --> 01:04:51,304
A common phrase in
zombie circles is

1265
01:04:51,337 --> 01:04:52,872
"blades don't need reloading."

1266
01:04:52,905 --> 01:04:55,308
I always say, yeah but,
blades need sharpening.

1267
01:04:55,341 --> 01:04:57,310
Have you ever tried to hit
someone with the back end

1268
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:58,578
of a machete?

1269
01:04:58,611 --> 01:05:01,147
Like the parts that aren't sharp
or the flat end of a machete?

1270
01:05:01,180 --> 01:05:02,515
They'd be like, ah,
why'd you do that?

1271
01:05:02,548 --> 01:05:03,683
You slapped me.

1272
01:05:03,716 --> 01:05:05,985
Pack of dogs, I'd have a big
pack of dogs, big vicious

1273
01:05:06,018 --> 01:05:09,221
and small vicious dogs
as long as there was dog food.

1274
01:05:09,255 --> 01:05:11,657
I guess the zombies would
provide the dog food but then

1275
01:05:11,691 --> 01:05:14,193
the dogs, you know how dogs like
to get into corpses and stuff

1276
01:05:14,226 --> 01:05:15,461
and they throw up.

1277
01:05:15,494 --> 01:05:17,597
I'd have to be letting the dog
out in the middle of the night

1278
01:05:17,630 --> 01:05:19,298
so they could vomit
and then the zombies

1279
01:05:19,332 --> 01:05:21,334
might get into the house.

1280
01:05:21,367 --> 01:05:23,903
It's interesting because if it
did happen, people would think,

1281
01:05:23,936 --> 01:05:26,672
okay, so it's like Romero
movies, but it might not be.

1282
01:05:26,706 --> 01:05:28,641
It might not necessarily
be George's vision.

1283
01:05:28,674 --> 01:05:29,909
It might be something else.

1284
01:05:29,942 --> 01:05:32,878
You might cut their head off or
smash it in and the body still

1285
01:05:32,912 --> 01:05:35,381
comes after you or something
like that, you know?

1286
01:05:35,414 --> 01:05:37,249
(laughing)

1287
01:05:37,283 --> 01:05:40,152
I think, you know,
movies show that there really

1288
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:43,923
is no good weapon,
they always find a way.

1289
01:05:43,956 --> 01:05:45,424
You're going to
run out of bullets.

1290
01:05:45,458 --> 01:05:50,863
There's too many to hold off
with a sword or a blunt object.

1291
01:05:50,896 --> 01:05:52,398
Fire doesn't stop them.

1292
01:05:52,431 --> 01:05:54,600
I mean, we're screwed.

1293
01:05:54,634 --> 01:05:57,470
I have never seen a zombie
movie where someone dies of

1294
01:05:57,503 --> 01:06:00,339
dehydration, but that's going
to kill a lot more people

1295
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:01,874
than zombie bites.

1296
01:06:01,907 --> 01:06:04,043
I've never seen a zombie movie
where someone has drunk from

1297
01:06:04,076 --> 01:06:07,813
a puddle and crapped themselves
to death, but that's going to

1298
01:06:07,847 --> 01:06:10,116
kill a lot more people
than zombie bites.

1299
01:06:10,149 --> 01:06:14,353
Starvation, disease, friendly
fire, accidents, infections,

1300
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:17,590
all these things are going
to kill people a lot faster.

1301
01:06:17,623 --> 01:06:19,425
Liberals will
become your zombies.

1302
01:06:19,458 --> 01:06:22,328
They're going to be the first
ones to cry and moan and die

1303
01:06:22,361 --> 01:06:25,297
and they're going to be the
first ones to do the looting,

1304
01:06:25,331 --> 01:06:29,468
the pillaging, and they're
going to be the zombies.

1305
01:06:29,502 --> 01:06:32,705
Like a lot of liberal Americans,
I was excited when Barack Obama

1306
01:06:32,738 --> 01:06:36,776
took office four years ago, but
it's a very different world now,

1307
01:06:36,809 --> 01:06:39,211
and Mitt Romney is a very
different candidate, one with

1308
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:42,381
the vision and determination to
cut through business as usual

1309
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:46,285
politics, and finally put this
country back on the path

1310
01:06:46,318 --> 01:06:47,953
to the zombie apocalypse.

1311
01:06:47,987 --> 01:06:50,756
He's not afraid to face
a ravening grasping hoard of

1312
01:06:50,790 --> 01:06:53,859
sub-humans because that's how
he sees poor people already.

1313
01:06:53,893 --> 01:06:56,262
<i>Paid for by the Committee to
Learn Parkour, like really soon</i>,

1314
01:06:56,295 --> 01:06:58,064
<i>like maybe take a class
or something</i>.

1315
01:07:02,568 --> 01:07:04,203
We talked to a lot of
survivalists and preppers,

1316
01:07:04,236 --> 01:07:06,505
each of them stressing
at the top of their list

1317
01:07:06,539 --> 01:07:09,041
the most important thing
during any catastrophe --

1318
01:07:09,075 --> 01:07:10,743
you know, like
a zombie apocalypse --

1319
01:07:10,776 --> 01:07:15,548
the need for clean water and
water filters like this one.

1320
01:07:15,581 --> 01:07:18,851
So in the name of survival,
I'm going to pee into this cup,

1321
01:07:18,884 --> 01:07:23,422
filter it, and then drink it,
because if this filter works,

1322
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:25,925
it's not really my
pee anymore, right?

1323
01:07:25,958 --> 01:07:27,526
You ready for this?

1324
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:29,762
Okay, here it goes.

1325
01:07:29,795 --> 01:07:32,298
I'm thinking like I'm
at a doctor's office.

1326
01:07:32,331 --> 01:07:36,202
Alright, here we go.

1327
01:07:36,235 --> 01:07:38,704
Zombies are coming.

1328
01:07:40,039 --> 01:07:42,074
It doesn't help
that it's fizzy.

1329
01:07:44,343 --> 01:07:45,544
It's warm.

1330
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:03,129
It kind of tastes
like water, yeah.

1331
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:05,865
I think that was safe to drink.

1332
01:08:05,898 --> 01:08:07,666
We're good.

1333
01:08:08,901 --> 01:08:10,436
MATT I've tried to break down
every state in the United States

1334
01:08:10,469 --> 01:08:13,739
based on zombie survivability
and I used 20 or 30 different

1335
01:08:13,773 --> 01:08:18,110
factors -- topography, climate,
public health infrastructure,

1336
01:08:18,144 --> 01:08:21,447
natural resources, military
presence, on and on and on,

1337
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:24,116
the most important one is
population density, by far.

1338
01:08:24,150 --> 01:08:25,918
Up there also is
gun ownership rate.

1339
01:08:25,951 --> 01:08:28,587
New Jersey ranks the lowest
in zombie survivability.

1340
01:08:28,621 --> 01:08:32,024
Population density of 1,000
people per square mile

1341
01:08:32,057 --> 01:08:34,693
and a gun ownership rate
of 12.3 percent.

1342
01:08:34,727 --> 01:08:38,631
Then we look at Wyoming --
population density of 5.6 people

1343
01:08:38,664 --> 01:08:42,201
per square mile and a gun
ownership rate of 68 percent,

1344
01:08:42,234 --> 01:08:44,637
so it's like one dude with a gun
sitting on a farm going,

1345
01:08:44,670 --> 01:08:46,772
"Hey buddy, do you see
a zombie over there?"

1346
01:08:46,806 --> 01:08:49,208
And the other guy yelling over,
"No, I don't see one!"

1347
01:08:49,241 --> 01:08:53,145
Five people per square mile
makes very few zombies.

1348
01:08:53,179 --> 01:08:54,780
The entire northeast
is totally screwed.

1349
01:08:54,814 --> 01:08:56,949
If you ever want a reason
not to move to New York City,

1350
01:08:56,982 --> 01:08:58,150
that's a reason.

1351
01:08:58,184 --> 01:08:59,952
When zombies come,
everybody's dead.

1352
01:08:59,985 --> 01:09:02,721
New York is the hero
city, it just is.

1353
01:09:02,755 --> 01:09:05,257
Like I was in New York for 9/11,
I was there for the blackout,

1354
01:09:05,291 --> 01:09:07,827
and look what happened with
this horrific storm?

1355
01:09:07,860 --> 01:09:10,629
New Yorkers freaking came
together, they kept calm,

1356
01:09:10,663 --> 01:09:13,165
they carried on, and they're
dealing, so New York can handle

1357
01:09:13,199 --> 01:09:15,734
anything and it's the most
densely populated place

1358
01:09:15,768 --> 01:09:17,736
in North America.

1359
01:09:17,770 --> 01:09:19,905
L.A., where I'm from, gone.

1360
01:09:19,939 --> 01:09:23,742
(laughter)

1361
01:09:23,776 --> 01:09:25,477
I think one of the greatest
misconceptions in zombie

1362
01:09:25,511 --> 01:09:28,414
survival is that zombies are
what you need to worry about

1363
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:29,682
when you're trying to survive.

1364
01:09:29,715 --> 01:09:32,418
Zombies are only one of a whole
host of threats that you really

1365
01:09:32,451 --> 01:09:36,121
need to face and I would argue
that humans are as great

1366
01:09:36,155 --> 01:09:40,125
or maybe even a greater threat
than zombies, right?

1367
01:09:40,159 --> 01:09:40,793
I'm not a horror fan.

1368
01:09:40,826 --> 01:09:42,895
I don't seek out fear.

1369
01:09:42,928 --> 01:09:47,433
I think that most horror fans,
in their core, feel safe.

1370
01:09:47,466 --> 01:09:48,534
I don't.

1371
01:09:48,567 --> 01:09:51,070
I naturally feel scared
so my writing is to exercise

1372
01:09:51,103 --> 01:09:53,105
an anxiety that I already have.

1373
01:09:53,138 --> 01:09:57,309
I base my zombies on AIDS.

1374
01:09:57,343 --> 01:10:01,213
Now AIDS is insanely
hard to get.

1375
01:10:01,247 --> 01:10:04,016
It's not waterborne, it's not
foodborne, it's not airborne.

1376
01:10:04,049 --> 01:10:06,986
How in the world did it kill
millions and millions of people

1377
01:10:07,019 --> 01:10:09,054
and still killing millions
and millions of people?

1378
01:10:09,088 --> 01:10:11,857
Because we, as people,
were stupid.

1379
01:10:11,891 --> 01:10:13,759
If the President of the United
States had gone on national

1380
01:10:13,792 --> 01:10:17,496
television in say 1981 and said
look, there's a really, really

1381
01:10:17,529 --> 01:10:20,633
horrible disease, hard to get,
but if you do get it, you're

1382
01:10:20,666 --> 01:10:24,837
doomed, so there's going to be
a national education campaign,

1383
01:10:24,870 --> 01:10:27,573
we could have cured AIDS with
a pamphlet and so it's easy to

1384
01:10:27,606 --> 01:10:31,510
imagine something like a zombie
plague getting out of control.

1385
01:10:34,113 --> 01:10:36,749
MATT: Absolutely, a zombie
pandemic is possible.

1386
01:10:36,782 --> 01:10:40,819
This new wave of zombies, this
living zombie, that is created

1387
01:10:40,853 --> 01:10:45,624
by some sort of infection or
virus that gets out of hand.

1388
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:48,093
I really do think that
it's more plausible now

1389
01:10:48,127 --> 01:10:50,396
than I did, say, five years ago.

1390
01:10:50,429 --> 01:10:52,364
Could a zombie
apocalypse happen?

1391
01:10:52,398 --> 01:10:55,467
Well, let's examine what we mean
or what the storytellers mean

1392
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:56,702
when they say this.

1393
01:10:56,735 --> 01:10:59,872
They mean a parasite jumping
from one organism to another.

1394
01:10:59,905 --> 01:11:02,041
This happens routinely.

1395
01:11:02,074 --> 01:11:05,010
60 percent of all human diseases
come from the animals

1396
01:11:05,044 --> 01:11:06,779
that we eat or live with.

1397
01:11:06,812 --> 01:11:09,782
AIDS has infected
75 billion people

1398
01:11:09,815 --> 01:11:11,483
and killed 35 million people.

1399
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:15,187
Bird flu and Swine flu,
the Bubonic Plague in Europe

1400
01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:17,990
killed half of the population
at the time.

1401
01:11:18,023 --> 01:11:21,527
The Spanish Epidemic in 1918
killed more people

1402
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:24,330
than the First World War.

1403
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:27,299
STEVEN: ANSD is the abbreviation
for the disease I made up,

1404
01:11:27,333 --> 01:11:30,102
it stands for Ataxic
Neurodegenerative Satiety

1405
01:11:30,135 --> 01:11:32,204
Deficiency Syndrome.

1406
01:11:32,237 --> 01:11:34,073
Ataxic means you
don't walk well.

1407
01:11:34,106 --> 01:11:37,142
Neurodegenerative means that
your brain is being degraded,

1408
01:11:37,176 --> 01:11:38,410
it's degenerating.

1409
01:11:38,444 --> 01:11:40,346
Satiety is a sense that you're
full, the sense that you've

1410
01:11:40,379 --> 01:11:41,680
eaten enough and that's
in your brain, too.

1411
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:43,515
Your brain is what tells you
you've eaten enough and it's

1412
01:11:43,549 --> 01:11:46,485
a syndrome because we don't
know what causes it.

1413
01:11:46,518 --> 01:11:47,953
There is one thing
that we can't ever do,

1414
01:11:47,987 --> 01:11:49,154
we can't raise the dead.

1415
01:11:49,188 --> 01:11:51,223
In the book I wrote,
we philosophically decided

1416
01:11:51,256 --> 01:11:53,325
that they were dead because
I realized medically speaking,

1417
01:11:53,359 --> 01:11:55,928
I can't have anything that makes
the dead come back to life,

1418
01:11:55,961 --> 01:12:00,065
but other than that aspect,
you can have brain pathology.

1419
01:12:00,099 --> 01:12:03,202
You can have neurobiological
insults that will yield

1420
01:12:03,235 --> 01:12:06,805
a kind of presentation
of a person who acts like

1421
01:12:06,839 --> 01:12:08,574
the zombies we see
in the movies.

1422
01:12:10,042 --> 01:12:12,945
There are many splendid examples
of parasites that control

1423
01:12:12,978 --> 01:12:16,815
behavior and often times, these
examples are as fantastical

1424
01:12:16,849 --> 01:12:20,319
or even more fantastical than we
can see in Hollywood creations.

1425
01:12:20,352 --> 01:12:23,689
So we have examples of fungi
controlling ant behavior.

1426
01:12:23,722 --> 01:12:28,327
We have emerald jeweled wasps
injecting a very specific mind

1427
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:31,096
manipulator into the brains
of cockroaches,

1428
01:12:31,130 --> 01:12:35,000
lots of examples of parasites
controlling behavior.

1429
01:12:35,034 --> 01:12:37,736
We call them zombies and
we even think about it now

1430
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:41,573
in the context of
zombie biology.

1431
01:12:41,607 --> 01:12:44,143
In the case of the ants,
the case of the zombie ants,

1432
01:12:44,176 --> 01:12:47,146
what happens is that a regular
colony of ants is living in

1433
01:12:47,179 --> 01:12:49,915
a tropical rain forest and
in the course of foraging,

1434
01:12:49,948 --> 01:12:53,085
they walk through a patch of
fungal spores in the ground

1435
01:12:53,118 --> 01:12:56,755
and these fungal spores attach
tightly and start replicating

1436
01:12:56,789 --> 01:13:01,894
inside its body...and then
at a particular moment when

1437
01:13:01,927 --> 01:13:05,030
the fungus needs to complete
the rest of its life cycle,

1438
01:13:05,064 --> 01:13:08,934
it controls the behavior of this
ant, making it leave the colony

1439
01:13:08,967 --> 01:13:11,670
and go out into the
understory vegetation

1440
01:13:11,703 --> 01:13:14,973
and go to the underside
of the leaf, deeply imbed

1441
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:18,744
those mandibles into the leaf,
because on the underside of

1442
01:13:18,777 --> 01:13:22,314
this leaf, on the platform,
the fungus is going to grow

1443
01:13:22,347 --> 01:13:25,918
a large stalk from the back of
the ant's head to produce spores

1444
01:13:25,951 --> 01:13:28,153
which are shot down
into the forest floor

1445
01:13:28,187 --> 01:13:31,857
and the cycle continues again.

1446
01:13:31,890 --> 01:13:33,659
Why doesn't it
happen for humans?

1447
01:13:33,692 --> 01:13:36,495
It really comes down
to a numbers game.

1448
01:13:36,528 --> 01:13:38,797
There are almost a million
species of insects

1449
01:13:38,831 --> 01:13:42,968
and there are roughly 5,500,
6,000 species of mammals.

1450
01:13:43,001 --> 01:13:47,139
So evolution just hasn't had
the opportunity to play with our

1451
01:13:47,172 --> 01:13:50,442
minds, but despite that, we do
see some really cool examples

1452
01:13:50,476 --> 01:13:52,811
in mammals of
controlled behavior.

1453
01:13:52,845 --> 01:13:56,815
Rabies is something that really
springs to people's minds.

1454
01:13:56,849 --> 01:13:58,617
MATT: When I was growing up,
no one ever talked about Mad Cow

1455
01:13:58,650 --> 01:14:01,186
Disease, but Mad Cow Disease
is in the news a lot now.

1456
01:14:01,220 --> 01:14:02,921
Here's the problem with Mad
Cow Disease, it's created by

1457
01:14:02,955 --> 01:14:06,091
a protein and it's called a
Prion, it's a mutated protein.

1458
01:14:06,125 --> 01:14:08,594
This protein, if it gets into
your brain, it causes all

1459
01:14:08,627 --> 01:14:11,163
the other proteins in your
brain to mutate also.

1460
01:14:11,196 --> 01:14:14,967
The new strain of this protein
is showing evidence that

1461
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,935
it can be transferred
from blood to blood.

1462
01:14:16,969 --> 01:14:20,139
On top of that, the new symptoms
are it causes you to go insane

1463
01:14:20,172 --> 01:14:22,841
and often violently insane.

1464
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:24,843
Mad Cow Disease turned
into Mad Human Disease

1465
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:26,278
turned into Mad Zombie Disease.

1466
01:14:26,311 --> 01:14:28,947
We already have Mad Cow,
we already have Mad Human,

1467
01:14:28,981 --> 01:14:31,517
and we're halfway to Mad Zombie,
but the problem is

1468
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:33,619
once it happens, it's too late.

1469
01:14:33,652 --> 01:14:36,355
There's no more polite
discussion about what it's

1470
01:14:36,388 --> 01:14:39,658
going to be like and debating
about the best way to survive.

1471
01:14:39,691 --> 01:14:41,160
It's run and scream time.

1472
01:14:41,193 --> 01:14:43,929
There's no more making movies,
there's no more watching TV,

1473
01:14:43,962 --> 01:14:45,831
there's just, oh my God,
I'm being eaten.

1474
01:14:45,864 --> 01:14:48,600
It appears the dead have risen
and are walking among us.

1475
01:14:48,634 --> 01:14:50,435
These zombies have a certain
sexual preference

1476
01:14:50,469 --> 01:14:51,970
by attacking only men.

1477
01:14:52,004 --> 01:14:54,106
Officials at the Pentagon
are not sure if this is

1478
01:14:54,139 --> 01:14:56,575
a biological attack or
if the zombies are simply

1479
01:14:56,608 --> 01:14:57,976
doing this by choice.

1480
01:15:06,952 --> 01:15:10,489
ALEX: In every town, in America
pretty much, or any town of any

1481
01:15:10,522 --> 01:15:13,659
reasonable size, there's a group
of young people engaged,

1482
01:15:13,692 --> 01:15:17,529
even as we speak, making their
independent zombie film.

1483
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:23,168
MAX: I don't know when
the zombie craze is going to

1484
01:15:23,202 --> 01:15:25,737
die out, I don't think it'll
ever die out completely.

1485
01:15:25,771 --> 01:15:27,272
I think they're,
in some element,

1486
01:15:27,306 --> 01:15:28,507
they're going to
be here to stay.

1487
01:15:28,540 --> 01:15:30,142
I didn't expect it
to go on this long.

1488
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:32,711
I happen to write "The Zombie
Paper" and then later the book,

1489
01:15:32,744 --> 01:15:36,782
just at the right time and then
it just keeps flying forward,

1490
01:15:36,815 --> 01:15:39,718
or shambling forward, I should
say, this whole zombie thing.

1491
01:15:39,751 --> 01:15:42,354
There's probably a ceiling on
zombie popularity, but I don't

1492
01:15:42,387 --> 01:15:45,057
know if we've seen it yet and
I don't know when we will see it

1493
01:15:45,090 --> 01:15:46,892
but as long as things
are fucked up.

1494
01:15:46,925 --> 01:15:56,969
♪

1495
01:15:56,969 --> 01:16:02,674
♪

1496
01:16:02,708 --> 01:16:06,211
I've heard a number of people
say, this is it, zombies have

1497
01:16:06,245 --> 01:16:08,847
run their course and now we're
going to see vampires again

1498
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,116
or we're going to see werewolves
or we're going to see tapeworms.

1499
01:16:11,149 --> 01:16:12,884
I don't know.

1500
01:16:12,918 --> 01:16:16,755
DR. BLUMBERG: "World War Z," the
movie, is a perfect case study

1501
01:16:16,788 --> 01:16:19,558
of not just how mainstream
zombies have become,

1502
01:16:19,591 --> 01:16:22,761
but how much more mainstream
they might become.

1503
01:16:22,794 --> 01:16:26,531
Because that film is a PG-13,
it is sort of a new frontier

1504
01:16:26,565 --> 01:16:27,799
in a sense.

1505
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:29,735
KYLE: And that was scooped
just a little bit by

1506
01:16:29,768 --> 01:16:32,137
the "Warm Bodies" film because
the "Warm Bodies" film

1507
01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:35,007
was kind of the first
zombie date movie.

1508
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:38,410
Now we have a zombie movie you
can bring your girlfriend to.

1509
01:16:38,443 --> 01:16:40,779
GREG: You know, to me, zombie
movies aren't zombie movies

1510
01:16:40,812 --> 01:16:42,114
without gore.

1511
01:16:42,147 --> 01:16:45,517
That's like doing a gangster
movie, but nobody has any guns.

1512
01:16:45,550 --> 01:16:50,155
Part of the whole culture of it
is the idea that you are being

1513
01:16:50,188 --> 01:16:55,260
devoured literally
by another human being.

1514
01:16:55,294 --> 01:16:58,630
FRAN: From "Night of the Living
Dead" to "World War Z,"

1515
01:16:58,664 --> 01:17:01,333
we've covered a lot of ground
so it'll be interesting to see

1516
01:17:01,366 --> 01:17:04,836
zombies in space or something.

1517
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:06,772
Not only do we have
PG-13 zombie movies,

1518
01:17:06,805 --> 01:17:08,807
we have kid zombie movies now.

1519
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:17,316
Hollywood is banking on zombies
being that big, and to me,

1520
01:17:17,349 --> 01:17:22,788
zombies have always been
small, little guys.

1521
01:17:22,821 --> 01:17:26,291
THEA: I really believe that it's
something that connects us all

1522
01:17:26,325 --> 01:17:28,660
and it's going to get bigger.

1523
01:17:28,694 --> 01:17:30,495
ROBERT: They're gonna be on your
streets, they're gonna be in

1524
01:17:30,529 --> 01:17:33,298
your stores, they're gonna be
coming at you, whether they're

1525
01:17:33,332 --> 01:17:37,002
fast or slow or whatever the
hell they are, but it's here to

1526
01:17:37,035 --> 01:17:40,572
stay, and you know what, if you
don't like it, get used to it

1527
01:17:40,605 --> 01:17:43,175
because it's not going anywhere.
