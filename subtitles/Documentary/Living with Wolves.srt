2
00:01:30,353 --> 00:01:33,274
- Is this the last one?
- I don't know.

3
00:01:33,566 --> 00:01:35,359
There's no ether, either.

4
00:01:35,443 --> 00:01:37,111
Jesus Christ.

5
00:01:37,946 --> 00:01:40,366
You there! Is this the last one?

6
00:01:47,584 --> 00:01:49,211
God, what a mess.

7
00:01:50,504 --> 00:01:52,381
At least there's no gangrene.

8
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,302
There will be if it doesn't come off soon.

9
00:01:55,385 --> 00:01:58,348
I can't saw if I can't keep my eyes open.

10
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:01,185
I'm sorry.

11
00:02:02,603 --> 00:02:05,649
Let's coffee up.
He can wait a few more minutes.

12
00:03:18,785 --> 00:03:19,995
God!

13
00:04:47,442 --> 00:04:48,443
Glass.

14
00:04:51,238 --> 00:04:54,075
- Is that Tucker's men?
- Yes, sir. I think it is.

15
00:04:54,534 --> 00:04:56,286
How long has it been like this?

16
00:04:56,369 --> 00:05:00,250
We found 'em this morning, sir.
They've been here for two days.

17
00:05:10,679 --> 00:05:12,600
Is that you, Lieutenant?

18
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,689
Sons of bitches.

19
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,696
Come on. You better take cover

20
00:05:24,989 --> 00:05:28,537
I ain't kidding. These boys are shooters.
Come on. Go under cover

21
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:30,665
There you go.

22
00:05:37,506 --> 00:05:39,510
You went to the hospital?

23
00:05:41,136 --> 00:05:42,638
It was no good

24
00:05:46,268 --> 00:05:48,061
What's going on here?

25
00:05:48,437 --> 00:05:50,189
What's going on here?

26
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:53,152
That seems to be the question, all right.

27
00:05:53,903 --> 00:05:56,030
See, you could ask the major...

28
00:05:56,865 --> 00:05:58,409
but he don't know

29
00:05:58,492 --> 00:05:59,827
He's busy.

30
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:02,789
He's busy trying to figure out
how come the officers' mess...

31
00:06:02,873 --> 00:06:04,875
run out of peach ice cream.

32
00:06:05,585 --> 00:06:07,671
Then, of course, you got the general.

33
00:06:08,005 --> 00:06:09,965
He comes up to see the show.

34
00:06:10,048 --> 00:06:12,093
All he knows is there ain't no show...

35
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,305
which ain't entirely correct
'cause we started a balloon up...

36
00:06:15,388 --> 00:06:18,058
but they shot her down
before we got off the ground.

37
00:06:18,142 --> 00:06:21,731
Nobody's made a run either way.
It's been a standoff all damned day.

38
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,820
Now, the major, he's
looking at the general.

39
00:06:27,946 --> 00:06:31,117
He's thinking to himself,
<i>I better do something.</i>

40
00:06:31,284 --> 00:06:32,786
You know what that means.

41
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,999
I sure as hell don't want to be
the first one across this field.

42
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:39,587
They're supposed to be beat up just like us

43
00:06:39,837 --> 00:06:43,175
Hell, everybody knows
Tucker's men are tough as cobs.

44
00:06:43,675 --> 00:06:47,431
So far, the only thing been killed out here
is three milking cows.

45
00:06:48,724 --> 00:06:50,601
Course, that's about to change

46
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:57,401
You son of a bitch.

47
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:02,825
You know, some of the boys are saying
if we ain't gonna fight...

48
00:07:04,077 --> 00:07:06,914
we could just settle
this whole business with a little...

49
00:07:06,956 --> 00:07:08,749
high-stakes poker.

50
00:07:08,832 --> 00:07:10,752
Wouldn't that be a sight?

51
00:07:10,835 --> 00:07:14,298
A bunch of fellas
sitting in the middle of this field...

52
00:07:14,382 --> 00:07:15,676
drawing cards.

53
00:07:25,021 --> 00:07:26,565
What is it, sir?

54
00:07:26,648 --> 00:07:28,108
Looks like a suicide

55
00:07:28,901 --> 00:07:30,111
Tucker!

56
00:07:42,669 --> 00:07:44,254
What's he doing?

57
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,126
- What did you say to him?
- I didn't say nothing.

58
00:08:38,407 --> 00:08:40,326
Come on back, you son of a bitch!

59
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:45,708
- You won't make it no second time!
- All right by me.

60
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:50,924
Forgive me, Father.

61
00:08:55,012 --> 00:08:57,641
- He's coming back again!
- Here he comes, boys!

62
00:09:32,311 --> 00:09:34,438
- Ready!
- I got him

63
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,949
Don't...

64
00:11:22,411 --> 00:11:24,039
Don't take off my foot.

65
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:27,335
You rest easy, son. You'll keep your foot.

66
00:11:27,793 --> 00:11:30,339
With God as my judge, you'll keep it.

67
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:37,556
- Bring up my ambulance.
- Sir?

68
00:11:38,057 --> 00:11:40,894
Bring up my ambulance,
and bring my surgeon with it!

69
00:11:42,562 --> 00:11:45,399
We got an officer
who's worth something lying here.

70
00:12:12,977 --> 00:12:15,480
<i>The strangeness of this life
cannot be measured.</i>

71
00:12:15,563 --> 00:12:17,316
<i>In trying to produce my own death...</i>

72
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,195
<i>I was elevated to the
status of a living hero.</i>

73
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:22,155
<i>I was also awarded Cisco...</i>

74
00:12:22,197 --> 00:12:25,201
<i>the trusty mount that carried
me across the field that day.</i>

75
00:12:25,284 --> 00:12:29,206
<i>And on full recovery, was given
transfer to any station I desired.</i>

76
00:12:29,456 --> 00:12:33,211
<i>The bloody slaughter continues in the east
as I arrive at Fort Hayes.</i>

77
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:38,009
<i>A tiny island of men and material surrounded
by a never-ending sea of prairie.</i>

78
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,294
Lieutenant.

79
00:13:59,322 --> 00:14:01,534
Where can I find Maj. Fambrough?

80
00:14:01,617 --> 00:14:03,203
Down at the end of the hall.

81
00:14:03,286 --> 00:14:04,621
Thank you.

82
00:14:14,009 --> 00:14:16,303
<i>Lt. John J. Dunbar.</i>

83
00:14:21,143 --> 00:14:23,021
Lt. John J. Dunbar?

84
00:14:23,521 --> 00:14:25,732
- Yes, sir.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

85
00:14:26,983 --> 00:14:28,736
Indian fighter

86
00:14:29,821 --> 00:14:30,989
Excuse me?

87
00:14:31,031 --> 00:14:33,576
It says here that you're
to be posted on the frontier.

88
00:14:33,659 --> 00:14:34,994
The frontier is Indian country.

89
00:14:35,077 --> 00:14:37,581
I quickly deduced that
you're an Indian fighter.

90
00:14:37,664 --> 00:14:40,292
I did not ascend to this position
by being stupid.

91
00:14:40,334 --> 00:14:42,253
- No, sir.
- No, sir

92
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:50,473
It says here that you've been decorated.

93
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,849
Yes, sir.

94
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,689
And they sent you here to be posted?

95
00:14:56,773 --> 00:14:59,485
Actually, sir, I'm here at my own request.

96
00:14:59,526 --> 00:15:01,445
Really? Why?

97
00:15:02,488 --> 00:15:05,116
I've always wanted to see the frontier.

98
00:15:05,325 --> 00:15:07,202
You want to see the frontier?

99
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:09,373
Yes, sir.

100
00:15:09,706 --> 00:15:10,874
Before it's gone.

101
00:15:17,674 --> 00:15:20,386
Such a smart lad, coming straight to me.

102
00:15:26,937 --> 00:15:28,063
Sir...

103
00:15:28,647 --> 00:15:29,898
Knight.

104
00:15:31,401 --> 00:15:33,986
I am sending you on a knight's errand.

105
00:15:35,488 --> 00:15:37,575
You will report to Captain Cargill...

106
00:15:38,243 --> 00:15:40,621
at the furthermost outpost of the realm...

107
00:15:41,247 --> 00:15:42,790
Fort Sedgewick.

108
00:15:44,834 --> 00:15:48,004
My personal seal will assure your safety...

109
00:15:48,588 --> 00:15:51,635
through many miles of
wild and hostile country.

110
00:16:01,605 --> 00:16:03,609
- I was wondering...
- Yes?

111
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:07,780
I was wondering, sir, how
will I be getting there?

112
00:16:08,782 --> 00:16:10,492
You think I don't know?

113
00:16:10,576 --> 00:16:12,579
- No, sir.
- You think that.

114
00:16:12,662 --> 00:16:14,873
- It's just that I don't know...
- Hold your tongue.

115
00:16:14,956 --> 00:16:17,544
I am in a generous mood
and I will grant your boon.

116
00:16:17,627 --> 00:16:19,671
See that peasant out there?

117
00:16:20,005 --> 00:16:21,591
He calls himself Timmons.

118
00:16:21,632 --> 00:16:25,595
He's going there this very afternoon.
You can ride with him if you like.

119
00:16:26,138 --> 00:16:29,225
He knows the way. Thank you. That is all.

120
00:16:41,949 --> 00:16:43,327
Sir Knight?

121
00:16:47,165 --> 00:16:49,377
I've just pissed in my pants...

122
00:16:51,462 --> 00:16:53,965
and nobody can do anything about it.

123
00:17:08,526 --> 00:17:10,153
To your journey!

124
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:16,578
To my journey!

125
00:17:34,308 --> 00:17:35,478
Haw!

126
00:17:37,897 --> 00:17:39,942
Over a little bit, Jim!

127
00:17:42,653 --> 00:17:44,322
- Have this by tomorrow.
- Yes, sir.

128
00:17:44,406 --> 00:17:46,324
I'll have my crown now.

129
00:17:47,701 --> 00:17:50,581
- Sir?
- I'll have my crown now!

130
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:54,836
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Are you deaf, fool?

131
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:57,339
I said I'll have my crown right now!

132
00:17:57,423 --> 00:17:58,507
Now!

133
00:18:02,889 --> 00:18:03,890
No.

134
00:18:05,433 --> 00:18:07,227
- I'll get your crown.
- No.

135
00:18:17,449 --> 00:18:18,450
Sir?

136
00:18:20,203 --> 00:18:21,329
Major?

137
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:27,586
The king is dead.

138
00:18:32,384 --> 00:18:34,137
Long live the king.

139
00:18:58,127 --> 00:19:00,504
Get these kids out of here, come on!

140
00:19:16,191 --> 00:19:17,860
Haw, Jim and Jake!

141
00:19:22,366 --> 00:19:24,411
Gee a little bit, Jim!

142
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:06,500
The hell was that?

143
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,380
What is that?

144
00:21:15,095 --> 00:21:16,889
What the hell is that?

145
00:21:42,088 --> 00:21:44,549
Why don't you put that in your book?

146
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,815
<i>Were it not for my companion...</i>

147
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:58,526
<i>I believe I would be having
the time of my life.</i>

148
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,986
<i>I know he means well...</i>

149
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:03,367
<i>but he is quite possibly
the foulest man I have ever met.</i>

150
00:22:38,244 --> 00:22:40,247
How far you make the Fort?

151
00:22:40,707 --> 00:22:41,749
Far.

152
00:22:44,795 --> 00:22:45,796
How far?

153
00:22:46,797 --> 00:22:48,757
Forty, fifty mile, maybe.

154
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:51,970
What's the big hurry on Sedgewick?

155
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:54,558
It's to be my post.

156
00:22:55,851 --> 00:22:57,102
My home.

157
00:23:02,484 --> 00:23:04,987
You ain't hard to please,
I'll give you that much.

158
00:23:10,328 --> 00:23:11,747
Look yonder

159
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,846
What you got there?

160
00:23:36,153 --> 00:23:39,407
Somebody back east is saying,
<i>Why don't she write?</i>

161
00:23:41,868 --> 00:23:43,579
You stupid bastard.

162
00:24:59,302 --> 00:25:00,887
Get up, Timmons.

163
00:25:04,808 --> 00:25:06,019
Get up!

164
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,622
Get up!

165
00:25:21,748 --> 00:25:23,375
Come on. Get up.

166
00:25:27,046 --> 00:25:29,341
Get up!

167
00:25:35,224 --> 00:25:38,144
Someone poked me in my butt. Was that you?

168
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,896
Goddamn it!

169
00:25:42,316 --> 00:25:44,110
I'm gonna have a welt.

170
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:00,376
Cpl. Guest?

171
00:27:13,643 --> 00:27:16,312
You don't have to talk to me,
just please come out.

172
00:27:37,549 --> 00:27:38,842
It's the end.

173
00:27:40,343 --> 00:27:43,139
Assemble the men in front of my quarters.

174
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:54,696
You hate me

175
00:27:56,615 --> 00:27:59,119
But I feel none of the same for you.

176
00:28:00,996 --> 00:28:02,539
You men stayed.

177
00:28:05,209 --> 00:28:08,047
You stayed after they took all our horses.

178
00:28:10,257 --> 00:28:12,762
You stayed after all the others deserted.

179
00:28:14,722 --> 00:28:17,768
You stayed after the army
failed to resupply us.

180
00:28:21,606 --> 00:28:24,484
I have looked for that
wagon from Fort Hayes...

181
00:28:24,692 --> 00:28:26,154
just as you have...

182
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:28,573
day after miserable day.

183
00:28:31,744 --> 00:28:34,372
And all I can say is that I'm proud of you.

184
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:39,504
Now get your things, men.
We're leaving this place.

185
00:28:40,422 --> 00:28:42,091
The army can go to hell.

186
00:28:46,388 --> 00:28:47,389
Go.

187
00:28:47,639 --> 00:28:49,225
Get your things.

188
00:29:28,817 --> 00:29:31,362
How come we haven't seen any buffalo?

189
00:29:31,779 --> 00:29:33,824
You can't figure the stinking buffalo.

190
00:29:34,283 --> 00:29:37,203
You can't.
Sometimes you won't see any for days.

191
00:29:37,287 --> 00:29:40,625
Other times, they'll be thick,
like curls on a whore

192
00:29:44,004 --> 00:29:45,340
What about Indians?

193
00:29:45,381 --> 00:29:47,759
Indians? Goddamn Indians!

194
00:29:48,177 --> 00:29:51,680
You just as soon not see 'em
unless the bastards are dead.

195
00:29:51,764 --> 00:29:54,225
They're nothing but thieves and beggars.

196
00:29:54,434 --> 00:29:55,936
Ho, up there!

197
00:31:24,968 --> 00:31:28,640
Not what you would call
much of a going concern now, is it?

198
00:31:33,396 --> 00:31:34,689
Go down there

199
00:31:34,814 --> 00:31:37,818
- Why? There ain't nothing down there.
- Because I said.

200
00:31:39,236 --> 00:31:40,488
Go down there.

201
00:31:45,578 --> 00:31:47,289
There, son of a bitch!

202
00:32:13,864 --> 00:32:15,826
There ain't nothing here, Lieutenant.

203
00:32:36,518 --> 00:32:38,856
There ain't nothing here, Lieutenant.

204
00:32:43,653 --> 00:32:45,030
Lieutenant!

205
00:32:46,574 --> 00:32:48,701
Everybody's run off or got killed.

206
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:10,313
All right. Let's unload the wagon.

207
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,317
What? What, and leave it all here?

208
00:33:14,943 --> 00:33:16,570
I'm staying, too.

209
00:33:17,112 --> 00:33:18,991
There ain't nothing here.

210
00:33:19,659 --> 00:33:22,119
No, not at the moment.

211
00:33:22,621 --> 00:33:24,581
We don't know what's happened.

212
00:33:26,959 --> 00:33:28,920
Things being as they are...

213
00:33:29,671 --> 00:33:32,759
we might as well
just turn around and get headed back.

214
00:33:32,967 --> 00:33:34,302
This is my post.

215
00:33:34,344 --> 00:33:35,637
<i>This is my post?</i>

216
00:33:35,804 --> 00:33:37,390
This is my post.

217
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,644
<i>This is my post?</i>

218
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,354
Jesus H. Christ.

219
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,107
What, are you crazy, boy?

220
00:33:47,653 --> 00:33:49,446
Fast son of a bitch.

221
00:33:50,156 --> 00:33:52,283
- Jesus H. Christ.
- This is my post.

222
00:33:52,367 --> 00:33:53,827
All right, put it down.

223
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:57,666
And these are the post provisions, all right?
Now get your ass off the wagon...

224
00:33:57,708 --> 00:33:59,836
- Put it down!
- And help me unload.

225
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,672
We're just havin' a conversation,
now put it down.

226
00:34:53,781 --> 00:34:56,116
I'll let them know where you are.

227
00:34:56,784 --> 00:34:57,868
Good.

228
00:35:00,413 --> 00:35:01,748
Good luck.

229
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,170
Thank you.

230
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,010
Jake and Jim!

231
00:35:22,317 --> 00:35:23,819
Good mule!

232
00:35:24,736 --> 00:35:25,988
Haw up there now!

233
00:35:56,152 --> 00:35:57,488
Good mules!

234
00:36:16,888 --> 00:36:19,724
<i>Have arrived to find
Fort Sedgewick deserted.</i>

235
00:36:19,807 --> 00:36:23,605
<i>Am now waiting for garrison's return
or word from headquarters.</i>

236
00:36:23,688 --> 00:36:25,858
<i>The posits in exceedingly poor condition...</i>

237
00:36:25,941 --> 00:36:29,905
<i>and I have decided to assign myself
clean-up duty beginning tomorrow.</i>

238
00:36:30,072 --> 00:36:31,823
<i>Supplies are abundant...</i>

239
00:36:31,865 --> 00:36:34,702
and the country
<i>is everything I dreamed it would be.</i>

240
00:36:34,744 --> 00:36:37,498
<i>There can be no place like this on Earth.</i>

241
00:38:36,568 --> 00:38:37,904
Bad horse.

242
00:38:38,696 --> 00:38:40,031
Bad horse.

243
00:41:47,106 --> 00:41:49,568
<i>The animals in the pond
had not been poisoned.</i>

244
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:51,278
<i>They had all been shot.</i>

245
00:41:51,362 --> 00:41:53,657
<i>But why? Was it for sport?</i>

246
00:41:54,199 --> 00:41:56,369
<i>Could it have been out of spite?</i>

247
00:41:56,452 --> 00:41:59,414
<i>My first guess would have been
that the men here were starving.</i>

248
00:41:59,498 --> 00:42:02,544
<i>But this rotting waste
speaks to the contrary.</i>

249
00:42:02,919 --> 00:42:05,421
<i>The caves are an even bigger mystery.</i>

250
00:42:05,547 --> 00:42:08,343
<i>What could have driven
men to live in caves?</i>

251
00:42:08,426 --> 00:42:10,345
<i>Perhaps they were frightened.</i>

252
00:42:10,428 --> 00:42:13,099
<i>Maybe there had been some sort of revolt.</i>

253
00:42:13,474 --> 00:42:16,603
I can make no sense of
the clues left me here.

254
00:42:16,812 --> 00:42:19,690
<i>Perhaps my relief will provide the answers.</i>

255
00:42:29,162 --> 00:42:31,247
Come on, Cisco. One more time.

256
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:32,498
Git up!

257
00:42:33,583 --> 00:42:35,503
Come on! Git up, Cisco.

258
00:42:39,091 --> 00:42:40,301
Git up!

259
00:42:41,635 --> 00:42:43,013
Git up! There you go!

260
00:42:43,471 --> 00:42:44,389
Easy.

275
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:40,915
<i>And if I...</i>

276
00:45:48,586 --> 00:45:50,088
Look at me.

277
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,727
Don't hurt my mules.

278
00:46:06,567 --> 00:46:07,777
Stop.

279
00:46:08,112 --> 00:46:09,113
Stop it.

280
00:46:33,978 --> 00:46:36,065
Please don't hurt my mules.

281
00:47:34,557 --> 00:47:36,809
<i>I am pleased with my efforts thus far.</i>

282
00:47:36,893 --> 00:47:41,441
<i>For all my improvements, though, there
remains an ugliness here I cannot dispel.</i>

283
00:47:41,524 --> 00:47:45,988
<i>An injury that goes beyond neglect
and like a bruise, it will be slow to heal.</i>

284
00:48:41,142 --> 00:48:43,145
<i>It's been almost 30 days.</i>

285
00:48:43,271 --> 00:48:46,817
<i>I have come to enjoy
the patterns of my life at Fort Sedgewick.</i>

286
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:49,946
<i>Especially my daily
reconnaissance rides with Cisco.</i>

287
00:48:50,822 --> 00:48:53,826
<i>Each day, we go further into the prairie
and every discovery...</i>

288
00:48:53,909 --> 00:48:57,289
<i>big or small,
becomes etched in my mind forever.</i>

289
00:48:57,789 --> 00:49:01,378
<i>It would seem I've been marooned,
as no one has yet come for me.</i>

290
00:49:01,461 --> 00:49:05,717
<i>I can only assume that there is a problem,
which the army will solve shortly.</i>

291
00:49:06,092 --> 00:49:08,886
<i>Maybe I am being foolish in my optimism...</i>

292
00:49:09,429 --> 00:49:11,807
<i>but when I look to the eastern horizon...</i>

293
00:49:11,974 --> 00:49:15,187
<i>I never fail to hope
that a column might be out there.</i>

294
00:49:22,904 --> 00:49:25,742
<i>Still no sign of Capt. Cargill's command.</i>

295
00:49:26,034 --> 00:49:28,580
<i>Though well-supplied,
I've decided to ration my goods...</i>

296
00:49:28,663 --> 00:49:32,125
<i>as if I were part
of a post instead of the whole affair.</i>

297
00:49:33,377 --> 00:49:36,839
<i>There's a wolf who seems intent
on the goings-on here.</i>

298
00:49:37,381 --> 00:49:40,386
<i>He does not seem inclined
to be a nuisance, however.</i>

299
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:43,515
<i>And aside from Cisco,
has been my only company.</i>

300
00:49:43,724 --> 00:49:47,062
<i>He's appeared
each afternoon for the past two days.</i>

301
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:49,356
<i>He has two milky white paws.</i>

302
00:49:50,732 --> 00:49:52,861
<i>If he comes calling tomorrow...</i>

303
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:55,197
<i>I will name him Two-Socks.</i>

304
00:51:47,008 --> 00:51:49,427
<i>Almost a month and no one has come.</i>

305
00:51:49,762 --> 00:51:51,514
<i>The longer this condition persists...</i>

306
00:51:51,555 --> 00:51:54,686
<i>the less inclined I am
to believe that anyone will.</i>

307
00:51:54,936 --> 00:51:57,981
<i>Rain has forced me indoors
for most of two days now...</i>

308
00:51:58,064 --> 00:52:00,234
<i>and I have begun work on an awning.</i>

309
00:52:04,906 --> 00:52:07,034
<i>It is the loneliest of times for me now...</i>

310
00:52:07,076 --> 00:52:10,205
<i>but I can say honestly
that I am not unhappy.</i>

311
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:02,607
<i>How can I marry a pretty little girl</i>

312
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:05,151
<i>When I got no coat to put on?</i>

313
00:53:06,194 --> 00:53:07,988
<i>Soldier, soldier</i>

314
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:09,907
<i>Won't you marry me</i>

315
00:53:10,199 --> 00:53:12,495
<i>Before the fight comes home?</i>

316
00:53:13,037 --> 00:53:16,123
<i>How can I marry a pretty little girl</i>

317
00:53:16,667 --> 00:53:19,002
<i>When I got no shoes to put on?</i>

318
00:53:34,313 --> 00:53:37,401
<i>How can I marry a pretty little girl</i>

319

<i>When I got no hat to put on?</i>

320
00:54:03,977 --> 00:54:06,898
<i>Soldier, soldier, won't you marry me</i>

321
00:54:07,024 --> 00:54:09,317
<i>Before the fight comes home?</i>

322
00:54:09,568 --> 00:54:12,238
<i>How can I marry an ugly little girl</i>

323
00:54:12,905 --> 00:54:14,866
<i>When I got a pretty wife back home?</i>

324
00:55:15,737 --> 00:55:17,072
You there!

325
00:56:00,336 --> 00:56:03,048
<i>Have made first contact with a wild Indian.</i>

326
00:56:03,131 --> 00:56:06,303
<i>One came to the fort
and tried to steal my horse.</i>

327
00:56:06,428 --> 00:56:09,139
<i>When I appeared,
he became frightened and ran off.</i>

328
00:56:09,932 --> 00:56:14,063
<i>Have decided to bury excess ordnance
lets it fall into enemy hands.</i>

329
00:56:14,188 --> 00:56:17,274
<i>Keeping only the barest
necessities for myself.</i>

330
00:56:22,615 --> 00:56:25,994
<i>My afternoon rides have been pared down
to short circular patrols...</i>

331
00:56:26,078 --> 00:56:28,247
<i>always keeping the post in sight.</i>

332
00:56:29,123 --> 00:56:32,378
<i>Am taking steps to prepare
for another visitation.</i>

333
00:56:32,504 --> 00:56:35,048
<i>Do not know how many more
might be in the vicinity...</i>

334
00:56:35,090 --> 00:56:38,594
<i>but am assuming that where there is one
there's sure to be another.</i>

335
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:44,394
<i>Most of my work has been geared
toward creating the illusion...</i>

336
00:56:44,477 --> 00:56:46,355
<i>of strength and stability.</i>

337
00:56:47,564 --> 00:56:51,111
<i>I'm still alone, however,
and unless troops arrive soon...</i>

338
00:56:51,194 --> 00:56:52,737
<i>all may be lost.</i>

374
01:00:28,015 --> 01:00:30,395
<i>It's been two days now, and nothing.</i>

375
01:00:30,436 --> 01:00:33,523
<i>My presence here must
have been reported by now.</i>

376
01:00:33,565 --> 01:00:36,485
<i>Have made all the
preparations I can think of.</i>

377
01:00:36,569 --> 01:00:39,072
<i>Cannot mount an adequate defense
as I am still alone.</i>

378
01:00:39,156 --> 01:00:41,825
<i>But will try to make
a big impression when they come.</i>

379
01:00:41,992 --> 01:00:43,203
<i>Waiting.</i>

380
01:00:43,704 --> 01:00:44,997
<i>Post-script...</i>

381
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:48,543
<i>The man I encountered was
a magnificent-looking fellow.</i>

447
01:11:53,070 --> 01:11:55,447
<i>I realize now that I have been wrong.</i>

448
01:11:55,489 --> 01:11:57,450
<i>All this time, I've been waiting.</i>

449
01:11:57,534 --> 01:11:59,077
<i>Waiting for what?</i>

450
01:11:59,119 --> 01:12:00,621
<i>For someone to find me?</i>

451
01:12:00,705 --> 01:12:02,541
<i>For Indians to take my horse?</i>

452
01:12:02,624 --> 01:12:04,251
<i>To see a buffalo?</i>

453
01:12:04,334 --> 01:12:07,630
<i>Since I have arrived at this post
I have been walking on eggs.</i>

454
01:12:07,714 --> 01:12:10,550
<i>It has become a bad habit
and I am sick of it.</i>

455
01:12:10,633 --> 01:12:13,053
<i>Tomorrow morning,
I will ride out to the Indians.</i>

456
01:12:13,137 --> 01:12:15,725
<i>I do not know the outcome
or wisdom of this thinking...</i>

457
01:12:15,808 --> 01:12:19,395
<i>but I've become a target
and a target makes a poor impression.</i>

458
01:12:19,478 --> 01:12:21,273
<i>I am through waiting.</i>

459
01:12:22,357 --> 01:12:24,276
What are you looking at?

460
01:13:55,102 --> 01:13:56,646
Son of a bitch!

461
01:14:09,663 --> 01:14:10,914
No. Wait.

462
01:14:11,957 --> 01:14:13,084
Wait.

463
01:14:15,546 --> 01:14:16,589
Wait.

464
01:14:19,926 --> 01:14:21,636
You need help. You're hurt.

465
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:23,765
- You need...
- No!

466
01:14:25,683 --> 01:14:28,271
Let me... You need help.

467
01:14:28,563 --> 01:14:31,608
You need help. You're hurt.
Let me help you.

468
01:14:36,113 --> 01:14:37,491
You're hurt.

469
01:14:42,664 --> 01:14:43,832
Don't.

470
01:18:02,256 --> 01:18:03,633
She's hurt.

471
01:18:10,182 --> 01:18:11,518
She's hurt.

473
01:18:28,540 --> 01:18:30,876
No. She's hurt.

492
01:21:19,929 --> 01:21:21,138
Welcome.

493
01:21:22,097 --> 01:21:23,350
Welcome.

494
01:21:25,602 --> 01:21:26,561
Hi!

495
01:21:33,780 --> 01:21:34,864
Come.

496
01:21:35,740 --> 01:21:37,368
Please, sit down.

497
01:21:38,285 --> 01:21:39,453
Sit down.

498
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:06,405
Wait just a... Just a minute.

500
01:22:41,534 --> 01:22:43,203
Tatanka. Buffalo.

501
01:22:44,204 --> 01:22:46,040
- Buffalo.
- Tatanka.

502
01:22:53,717 --> 01:22:55,385
Buffalo. Tatanka.

503
01:22:58,139 --> 01:23:01,476
<i>The fierce one, as I call him,
seems a very tough fellow.</i>

504
01:23:01,559 --> 01:23:03,395
<i>I hope I never have to fight him.</i>

505
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:07,068
<i>From the little I know,
he seems to be honest and very direct.</i>

506
01:23:07,151 --> 01:23:09,362
<i>I like the quiet one immensely.</i>

507
01:23:09,445 --> 01:23:11,364
<i>He's been patient and inquisitive.</i>

508
01:23:11,405 --> 01:23:13,534
<i>He seems eager to communicate.</i>

509
01:23:13,617 --> 01:23:16,871
<i>I would conclude that he is a man
of some weight among his people.</i>

510
01:23:16,956 --> 01:23:18,207
Buffalo.

511
01:23:26,342 --> 01:23:29,554
<i>I believe I made an even greater impression
on their next visit.</i>

512
01:23:29,595 --> 01:23:33,852
I produced a coffee grinder,
something none of them had seen before.

513
01:24:15,990 --> 01:24:17,366
Is the coffee not good?

514
01:24:18,659 --> 01:24:20,245
It's too strong, maybe.

515
01:24:23,165 --> 01:24:24,334
Sugar.

516
01:24:25,502 --> 01:24:26,670
Put in.

517
01:24:36,474 --> 01:24:37,726
Taste it.

518
01:24:49,074 --> 01:24:50,243
Sugar.

519
01:24:51,285 --> 01:24:52,788
You want some?

520
01:24:53,372 --> 01:24:54,831
You want some?

521
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:02,341
That's a lot.

522
01:25:08,724 --> 01:25:09,725
Okay.

523
01:25:10,477 --> 01:25:11,478
Yeah.

524
01:25:15,942 --> 01:25:18,279
<i>It's good to finally have some company.</i>

525
01:25:18,362 --> 01:25:21,324
<i>So much goes unsaid
and I have the feeling that these people...</i>

526
01:25:21,408 --> 01:25:24,245
<i>the quiet one in particular,
want something from me.</i>

527
01:25:24,328 --> 01:25:26,706
<i>Made presents of coffee
and most of the sugar.</i>

528
01:25:26,747 --> 01:25:29,042
<i>It didn't figure to last anyway.</i>

529
01:25:29,126 --> 01:25:30,962
<i>Don't believe I go too far in saying...</i>

530
01:25:31,045 --> 01:25:33,841
<i>that a foundation
for good relations is being laid.</i>

566
01:29:45,708 --> 01:29:47,043
Christinel

567
01:30:02,605 --> 01:30:04,899
Get 'em, Joe! Get them chickens!

568
01:30:07,611 --> 01:30:10,240
Billy, you get away from those puppies!

569
01:30:16,915 --> 01:30:18,000
Damn!

570
01:30:18,625 --> 01:30:21,254
Get the kids, and get them in the house.

571
01:30:22,589 --> 01:30:23,757
Go on!

572
01:30:26,177 --> 01:30:27,512
Christine!

573
01:30:28,471 --> 01:30:31,183
Christine! Where are you?

574
01:30:33,019 --> 01:30:34,813
I'm up here, mother.

575
01:30:34,897 --> 01:30:36,816
- Get down now.
- Why?

576
01:30:36,899 --> 01:30:38,277
Just do it.

577
01:30:46,244 --> 01:30:49,958
Stay right where you are. Get back.
Do you hear me?

578
01:30:51,001 --> 01:30:53,296
Joe, get in the house right now!

579
01:31:00,304 --> 01:31:01,474
Willie!

580
01:31:02,099 --> 01:31:05,520
- Who is it, Willie?
- They look like Pawnee.

581
01:31:05,562 --> 01:31:08,523
My father and your father
are talking to them.

582
01:31:09,274 --> 01:31:11,819
- What do they want?
- I don't know.

583
01:31:12,654 --> 01:31:15,241
Go on. You heard him. Get out of here.

584
01:31:27,798 --> 01:31:29,843
Run, Christine!

585
01:31:30,219 --> 01:31:32,179
I said run!

586
01:31:34,891 --> 01:31:36,309
Joe!

587
01:31:52,330 --> 01:31:53,665
Christine!

588
01:32:05,639 --> 01:32:07,099
Mommyl

589
01:32:46,108 --> 01:32:48,945
Come on, Two Socks. Bacon.

590
01:32:48,987 --> 01:32:52,283
<i>Two Socks, like Cisco,
has become a trusted friend.</i>

591
01:32:52,450 --> 01:32:54,619
<i>He still won't eat from my hand...</i>

592
01:32:54,702 --> 01:32:58,957
<i>but his keen eyes and ears never fail
to alert me when something is wrong.</i>

593
01:33:24,324 --> 01:33:25,534
Tatanka.

594
01:33:27,621 --> 01:33:28,622
No.

595
01:33:28,831 --> 01:33:31,041
No, I haven't seen any buffalo.

596
01:33:31,918 --> 01:33:33,086
Sorry.

597
01:33:52,027 --> 01:33:54,071
Are you hungry?

598
01:33:55,991 --> 01:33:57,492
Are you hungry?

599
01:33:57,993 --> 01:34:01,247
I have food. I have a lot of food.

600
01:34:24,903 --> 01:34:27,698
<i>Nothing I've been told
about these people is correct.</i>

601
01:34:27,782 --> 01:34:29,533
<i>They are not beggars and thieves.</i>

602
01:34:29,617 --> 01:34:32,496
<i>They are not the bogeymen
they've been made out to be.</i>

603
01:34:32,621 --> 01:34:36,877
<i>On the contrary, they are polite guests
and have a familiar humor I enjoy.</i>

604
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:39,088
<i>Real communication is slow, however...</i>

605
01:34:39,171 --> 01:34:42,008
<i>and the quiet one is as frustrated as I am.</i>

606
01:34:42,092 --> 01:34:44,970
<i>Most of our progress
has been built on the basis of failure...</i>

607
01:34:45,054 --> 01:34:46,931
<i>rather than success.</i>

608
01:34:47,014 --> 01:34:50,937
<i>I've thought to inquire
if the woman I found lived or not...</i>

609
01:34:51,187 --> 01:34:54,942
<i>but it seems far too complicated a subject,
given our limitations.</i>

610
01:34:55,025 --> 01:34:57,778
<i>One thing is clear, however.
There are no buffalo.</i>

611
01:34:57,820 --> 01:35:00,281
<i>And it weighs heavy on their minds.</i>

612
01:35:00,491 --> 01:35:02,786
<i>Yesterday's meeting was the best yet.</i>

613
01:35:02,911 --> 01:35:07,208
<i>It seems I've been invited to the village
and I'm looking forward to going.</i>

617
01:37:01,148 --> 01:37:02,441
Hello.

618
01:37:03,650 --> 01:37:04,818
You...

619
01:37:05,611 --> 01:37:06,779
Here...

620
01:37:09,490 --> 01:37:10,617
Good.

621
01:37:14,164 --> 01:37:16,250
Thank you. I feel good.

622
01:37:17,001 --> 01:37:17,960
I feel good.

624
01:37:28,641 --> 01:37:32,938
The soldier fort.

625
01:37:33,773 --> 01:37:34,899
Wait.

626
01:37:36,984 --> 01:37:38,695
What is your names?

627
01:37:39,781 --> 01:37:42,701
- Our names?
- What is his name?

629
01:37:55,592 --> 01:37:56,844
He...

630
01:37:58,554 --> 01:37:59,847
He...

631
01:38:00,891 --> 01:38:02,017
Kick.

632
01:38:02,559 --> 01:38:04,061
Kick?

633
01:38:04,645 --> 01:38:05,688
More.

634
01:38:06,064 --> 01:38:07,191
More kick?

635
01:38:07,608 --> 01:38:09,068
More kicking?

636
01:38:09,528 --> 01:38:10,737
Kicking.

637
01:38:12,906 --> 01:38:15,409
Bird? Bird, kicking bird.

638
01:38:15,493 --> 01:38:17,161
Kicking Bird.

639
01:38:22,418 --> 01:38:23,796
What is he...

640
01:38:25,422 --> 01:38:26,799
Is he chief?

641
01:38:27,133 --> 01:38:28,176
No.

642
01:38:40,567 --> 01:38:43,237
A holy man.

643
01:38:43,696 --> 01:38:45,614
Holy man.

644
01:38:50,414 --> 01:38:51,373
Your name?

645
01:38:53,167 --> 01:38:55,920
- I don't...
- How are you called?

646
01:39:27,337 --> 01:39:28,713
Get up?

647
01:39:33,511 --> 01:39:34,637
Stand up?

648
01:39:36,139 --> 01:39:37,682
Stands?

649
01:39:38,725 --> 01:39:40,771
Stands. Your name's 'Stands'?

650
01:39:41,146 --> 01:39:42,648
Stands.

651
01:39:45,944 --> 01:39:47,987
- With.
- With?

652
01:39:48,071 --> 01:39:51,033
- With.
- Stands with?

653
01:39:54,247 --> 01:39:55,331
Fist?

654
01:39:55,957 --> 01:39:56,999
Yes.

655
01:39:57,542 --> 01:39:59,294
Stands With A Fist?

656
01:40:02,631 --> 01:40:04,342
Stands With A Fist.

657
01:40:04,801 --> 01:40:06,387
I'm John Dunbar.

658
01:40:07,388 --> 01:40:09,432
John Dunbar.

659
01:40:15,940 --> 01:40:17,359
Dumb Bear.

660
01:40:18,235 --> 01:40:20,113
No, not Dumb Bear.

661
01:40:20,864 --> 01:40:22,032
Dunbar.

662
01:40:23,075 --> 01:40:24,034
Dun...

663
01:40:24,118 --> 01:40:25,286
Bar.

664
01:40:25,578 --> 01:40:26,788
Not Dumb Bear.

665
01:40:26,872 --> 01:40:28,081
Dunbar.

666
01:40:45,438 --> 01:40:48,065
<i>There's been an exciting breakthrough
with the Indians.</i>

667
01:40:48,107 --> 01:40:50,444
<i>The woman I found
on the prairie speaks English...</i>

668
01:40:50,527 --> 01:40:52,946
<i>and today, clear progress was made.</i>

669
01:40:53,113 --> 01:40:57,160
<i>She is white, and though I cannot be sure
how she came to be with these people...</i>

670
01:40:57,243 --> 01:40:59,456
<i>I can tell she is not a captive.</i>

671
01:40:59,748 --> 01:41:01,124
<i>While I'm not afraid...</i>

672
01:41:01,208 --> 01:41:04,128
<i>I don't feel completely
welcome by everyone in the village.</i>

673
01:41:04,212 --> 01:41:07,007
<i>My being here must be Kicking Bird's idea.</i>

674
01:41:07,382 --> 01:41:10,010
<i>He is very enthusiastic
and like two children...</i>

675
01:41:10,093 --> 01:41:13,015
<i>we are both anxious
to know more about each other.</i>

676
01:41:13,098 --> 01:41:15,309
<i>But I find myself holding back.</i>

677
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:18,855
<i>For some reason,
I am reluctant to answer all his questions.</i>

678
01:41:18,939 --> 01:41:20,398
<i>Maybe it's my sense of duty...</i>

679
01:41:20,482 --> 01:41:23,110
<i>but something tells me not to say too much.</i>

680
01:41:35,585 --> 01:41:37,796
<i>It was good to see Fort Sedgewick again...</i>

681
01:41:37,838 --> 01:41:41,677
<i>and yet I look forward
to another visit with my new neighbors.</i>

682
01:41:44,472 --> 01:41:46,140
<i>This is still my home, however...</i>

683
01:41:46,224 --> 01:41:48,978
<i>and I remain watchful
for my relief and can only hope...</i>

684
01:41:49,061 --> 01:41:53,317
<i>that my negotiations with the wild
people of the plains will bear fruit.</i>

685
01:44:00,648 --> 01:44:01,566
Buffalo!

686
01:44:02,650 --> 01:44:05,614
Buffalo! I've seen buffalo!

687
01:44:36,110 --> 01:44:37,529
Buffaloes!

688
01:44:37,863 --> 01:44:39,323
Tatanka.

689
01:44:41,033 --> 01:44:42,410
Tatanka?

690
01:44:42,494 --> 01:44:43,578
Yeah.

691
01:45:25,800 --> 01:45:28,596
<i>Riders were sent out to pick up the trail.</i>

692
01:45:28,804 --> 01:45:31,558
<i>In the time it took to gather
my things at Sedgewick...</i>

693
01:45:31,641 --> 01:45:34,144
<i>the entire tribe was well on its way.</i>

694
01:45:34,394 --> 01:45:37,148
<i>Their efficiency and speed
with which they moved...</i>

695
01:45:37,231 --> 01:45:40,152
<i>was enough to impress
any military commander.</i>

696
01:45:40,486 --> 01:45:44,282
<i>Spirits are high, and overnight
I've gone from a person of suspicion...</i>

697
01:45:44,324 --> 01:45:46,452
<i>to one of genuine standing.</i>

698
01:45:46,660 --> 01:45:50,248
<i>I am greeted with open smiles
and looks of appreciation.</i>

699
01:45:50,332 --> 01:45:52,501
<i>In short, I have become a celebrity.</i>

700
01:45:52,585 --> 01:45:53,961
Loo ten tant!

701
01:45:54,171 --> 01:45:56,798
- Loo ten tant!
- Loo ten tant!

702
01:45:57,966 --> 01:46:01,095
<i>Scouts picked up the trail
exactly where I said it would be.</i>

703
01:46:01,930 --> 01:46:03,849
<i>It was not hard to find...</i>

704
01:46:03,933 --> 01:46:07,855
<i>a gigantic swath of torn-up ground
extending to the horizon.</i>

705
01:46:07,939 --> 01:46:11,150
<i>The numbers it took to create
this impossible image...</i>

706
01:46:11,192 --> 01:46:12,986
<i>was hard to imagine.</i>

707
01:47:39,515 --> 01:47:40,892
Loo ten tant!

708
01:47:43,102 --> 01:47:44,438
Loo ten tant!

709
01:50:11,670 --> 01:50:13,672
<i>Who would do such a thing?</i>

710
01:50:13,755 --> 01:50:15,133
<i>The field was proof enough...</i>

711
01:50:15,174 --> 01:50:18,220
<i>that it was a people
without value and without soul.</i>

712
01:50:18,471 --> 01:50:20,765
<i>With no regard for Sioux rights.</i>

713
01:50:21,307 --> 01:50:24,228
<i>The wagon tracks
leading away left little doubt...</i>

714
01:50:24,312 --> 01:50:27,983
<i>and my heart sank,
as I knew it could only be white hunters.</i>

715
01:50:28,233 --> 01:50:30,361
<i>Voices that had been joyous all morning...</i>

716
01:50:30,445 --> 01:50:34,450
<i>were now as silent as the dead buffalo
left to rot in this valley...</i>

717
01:50:34,533 --> 01:50:38,204
<i>killed only for their tongues
and the price of their hides.</i>

718
01:51:18,423 --> 01:51:19,758
Loo ten tant.

719
01:55:08,847 --> 01:55:11,517
<i>It was suddenly clear now
what had happened...</i>

720
01:55:11,559 --> 01:55:14,103
<i>and my heart sank
as I tried to convince myself...</i>

721
01:55:14,186 --> 01:55:18,024
<i>that the white men who'd been killed
were bad people and deserved to die.</i>

722
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:19,944
<i>But it was no use.</i>

723
01:55:20,027 --> 01:55:22,865
<i>I tried to believe
that Wind In His Hair and Kicking Bird...</i>

724
01:55:22,948 --> 01:55:27,162
<i>and the others who shared in the killing
were not so happy for having done it.</i>

725
01:55:27,245 --> 01:55:28,706
<i>But they were.</i>

726
01:55:30,583 --> 01:55:33,962
<i>As I looked at familiar faces,
I realized that the gap between us...</i>

727
01:55:34,045 --> 01:55:36,924
<i>was greater than I could
ever have imagined.</i>

728
01:55:56,617 --> 01:55:59,703
<i>As they celebrated into the night
the coming hunt...</i>

729
01:55:59,787 --> 01:56:02,083
<i>it was hard to know where to be.</i>

730
01:56:02,666 --> 01:56:06,588
<i>I don't know if they understood,
but I could not sleep among them.</i>

731
01:56:06,713 --> 01:56:09,759
<i>There had been no looks,
and there was no blame.</i>

732
01:56:10,051 --> 01:56:14,306
<i>There was only the confusion of a people
not able to predict a future.</i>

733
02:03:06,924 --> 02:03:08,425
Are you all right?

734
02:04:57,775 --> 02:04:59,027
I can't.

735
02:05:00,153 --> 02:05:02,490
No, I'm full.

736
02:05:02,574 --> 02:05:05,953
I'm full, and I can't
tell the story anymore.

737
02:05:07,122 --> 02:05:08,290
No.

738
02:05:15,965 --> 02:05:17,634
You want to try it?

739
02:05:18,552 --> 02:05:20,221
You want to try it?

740
02:05:23,851 --> 02:05:24,935
Here.

741
02:05:54,974 --> 02:05:56,976
I can't. This is too much.

742
02:06:04,070 --> 02:06:05,446
Good trade.

743
02:06:08,450 --> 02:06:10,702
This is a good trade.

744
02:06:15,752 --> 02:06:18,380
No, no, I can't. I'm full, I'm tired.

745
02:06:18,463 --> 02:06:19,506
No!

746
02:06:29,937 --> 02:06:32,106
Loo ten tant! Loo ten tant!

747
02:06:40,158 --> 02:06:42,452
Tatanka. Big tatanka.

748
02:06:42,536 --> 02:06:43,955
Big tatanka.

749
02:07:13,951 --> 02:07:15,037
That's my hat!

750
02:07:25,467 --> 02:07:27,052
You're wearing my hat.

751
02:07:30,973 --> 02:07:32,351
It's my hat.

753
02:07:37,483 --> 02:07:39,234
No, you...

754
02:07:40,694 --> 02:07:41,905
My hat.

762
02:09:05,597 --> 02:09:06,973
Good trade.

763
02:11:19,728 --> 02:11:21,272
There you are.

764
02:11:21,356 --> 02:11:22,982
Come here, Cisco.

765
02:12:20,015 --> 02:12:22,851
<i>It seems every day ends
with a miracle here.</i>

766
02:12:22,934 --> 02:12:26,190
<i>And whatever God may be,
I thank God for this day.</i>

767
02:12:27,358 --> 02:12:29,736
<i>To stay any longer would have been useless.</i>

768
02:12:29,861 --> 02:12:32,739
<i>We had all the meat we
could possibly carry.</i>

769
02:12:33,031 --> 02:12:35,951
<i>We had hunted for three days,
losing a half a dozen ponies...</i>

770
02:12:36,035 --> 02:12:38,080
<i>and only three men injured.</i>

771
02:12:38,664 --> 02:12:41,125
<i>I'd never known a people
so eager to laugh...</i>

772
02:12:41,209 --> 02:12:44,380
<i>so devoted to family,
so dedicated to each other.</i>

773
02:12:45,047 --> 02:12:48,093
<i>And the only word
that came to mind was 'harmony.</i>

774
02:12:57,230 --> 02:12:59,357
<i>Many times I've felt alone...</i>

775
02:12:59,524 --> 02:13:01,568
<i>but until this afternoon...</i>

776
02:13:01,652 --> 02:13:03,446
<i>I'd never felt completely lonely.</i>

777
02:13:09,161 --> 02:13:11,206
<i>Made a long patrol today.</i>

778
02:13:11,581 --> 02:13:13,625
<i>There's nothing to report.</i>

779
02:13:13,875 --> 02:13:16,755
<i>Time seems irrelevant
except for the fact that I am bored...</i>

780
02:13:16,839 --> 02:13:19,217
<i>and these hours alone are endless.</i>

781
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:41,661
<i>It is difficult for me to
muster any enthusiasm...</i>

782
02:13:41,703 --> 02:13:43,915
<i>for my regular duties here.</i>

783
02:13:43,999 --> 02:13:46,502
<i>And the fort is showing
serious signs of neglect.</i>

784
02:13:49,380 --> 02:13:52,843
<i>The truth is,
I am missing the company of my friends.</i>

785
02:13:52,885 --> 02:13:56,515
<i>I can see all of their faces,
but somehow it is not enough.</i>

786
02:13:56,640 --> 02:13:58,684
<i>Tomorrow I will pay them a visit.</i>

787
02:13:58,768 --> 02:14:01,563
<i>It may be forward of me,
but what can it hurt?</i>

788
02:14:01,938 --> 02:14:04,274
<i>After all, they are my neighbors.</i>

789
02:15:18,455 --> 02:15:22,251
<i>The night sounds have become so familiar
as to be comforting.</i>

790
02:15:22,418 --> 02:15:26,798
<i>My life on the prairie's a good one
and for the most part, I am content.</i>

791
02:15:40,691 --> 02:15:44,529
<i>The Indians have a great pull for me
that goes beyond curiosity.</i>

792
02:15:44,571 --> 02:15:47,408
<i>There's something wise about them
and I'm drawn to them...</i>

793
02:15:47,492 --> 02:15:50,996
<i>in ways much stronger
than my obligations to the military.</i>

794
02:17:09,848 --> 02:17:11,141
Go home!

795
02:17:14,687 --> 02:17:15,981
Damn him.

796
02:17:36,257 --> 02:17:37,926
God! Go home!

797
02:17:43,643 --> 02:17:44,644
Go!

798
02:17:44,977 --> 02:17:46,687
Go home, Two Socks!

799
02:17:48,106 --> 02:17:49,525
Bad wolf!

802
02:18:52,732 --> 02:18:57,070
<i>It is autumn now and I am spending
more time than ever with my friends.</i>

803
02:18:57,112 --> 02:19:00,741
<i>They have given me my own lodge
and I feel comfortable there.</i>

804
02:19:00,824 --> 02:19:04,872
<i>We talk every day, but I know
Kicking Bird is frustrated with me.</i>

805
02:19:04,955 --> 02:19:08,418
<i>He always wants to know
how many more white people are coming.</i>

806
02:19:08,627 --> 02:19:13,341
<i>I tell him they will most likely
pass through this country and nothing more.</i>

807
02:19:13,508 --> 02:19:15,637
<i>But I am speaking in half-truths.</i>

808
02:19:15,803 --> 02:19:20,351
<i>One day there will be too many,
but I cannot bring myself to tell him that.</i>

809
02:19:20,476 --> 02:19:23,730
<i>I am sure that Stands With A Fist
knows that I am holding back...</i>

810
02:19:24,022 --> 02:19:26,525
but to her credit, she says nothing.

811
02:19:55,396 --> 02:19:59,568
<i>A war party is going against the
Pawnee soon and I have asked to go.</i>

812
02:19:59,693 --> 02:20:01,863
<i>I sense I made a mistake in doing so...</i>

813
02:20:01,946 --> 02:20:04,825
<i>but I could not bring
myself to take it back.</i>

814
02:20:04,867 --> 02:20:07,578
<i>They are my friends,
and from what little I gather...</i>

815
02:20:07,661 --> 02:20:10,166
<i>the Pawnee have been
very hard on these people.</i>

816
02:20:10,249 --> 02:20:12,960
<i>I hope I have not overstepped my bounds.</i>

817
02:20:17,382 --> 02:20:18,968
Come in, please.

818
02:20:21,430 --> 02:20:22,681
Sit down?

819
02:20:26,186 --> 02:20:28,272
Kicking Bird want to know...

820
02:20:28,355 --> 02:20:31,942
why you want to make war on the Pawnee.

821
02:20:32,569 --> 02:20:35,281
They have done nothing to you.

822
02:20:35,948 --> 02:20:37,826
They are Sioux enemies.

823
02:20:45,376 --> 02:20:48,131
Only Sioux warriors to go.

824
02:20:49,090 --> 02:20:50,968
Tell him that I have been a warrior...

825
02:20:51,052 --> 02:20:54,388
longer than many of the young men
who will go on this war party.

826
02:20:54,848 --> 02:20:56,099
Tell him.

827
02:21:10,701 --> 02:21:13,956
He said that the Sioux way
of being a warrior...

828
02:21:14,039 --> 02:21:15,959
is not the white way.

829
02:21:16,543 --> 02:21:20,589
- You are not ready.
- I know, I understand.

830
02:21:20,631 --> 02:21:23,218
Tell him I cannot learn these ways in camp.

831
02:21:30,644 --> 02:21:32,814
He also asks that you...

832
02:21:33,815 --> 02:21:37,278
watch over his family while he is gone.

833
02:21:38,279 --> 02:21:42,034
This thing he asks is a
great honor for you.

834
02:21:45,581 --> 02:21:49,502
Tell him that I would be happy
to watch over his family.

835
02:21:55,927 --> 02:21:58,681
He thanks Dances With Wolves for coming.

836
02:22:00,182 --> 02:22:02,184
Who is Dances With Wolves?

837
02:22:04,146 --> 02:22:07,650
It is the name which all the people...

838
02:22:07,735 --> 02:22:09,528
are calling you now.

839
02:22:10,070 --> 02:22:11,572
Dances With...

840
02:22:13,033 --> 02:22:14,534
That's right.

841
02:22:14,951 --> 02:22:16,244
That day.

842
02:22:17,496 --> 02:22:19,165
Dances With Wolves.

843
02:22:20,834 --> 02:22:22,503
How do you say it?

846
02:24:10,936 --> 02:24:12,187
I'm here.

847
02:24:15,358 --> 02:24:16,776
We walk.

848
02:24:49,902 --> 02:24:51,445
I cut this off.

849
02:24:52,447 --> 02:24:54,741
I shaved it off. More.

850
02:24:56,911 --> 02:24:59,038
Grass grows on the prairie.

851
02:24:59,080 --> 02:25:00,583
<i>Grass grows on the prairie'?</i>

852
02:25:02,836 --> 02:25:04,296
- Wrong.
- Wrong?

853
02:25:04,379 --> 02:25:06,549
You said, <i>"Fire lives on the prairie"</i>

854
02:25:06,591 --> 02:25:07,842
I did?

855
02:25:08,509 --> 02:25:11,471
No laughing, though.

856
02:25:15,477 --> 02:25:18,314
That man is a fighter.

857
02:25:22,569 --> 02:25:23,779
Again.

858
02:25:24,572 --> 02:25:27,951
- That man is a fighter.
- Okay, I have it.

859
02:25:31,623 --> 02:25:32,749
Yes.

860
02:25:40,176 --> 02:25:41,929
Hoo hoo, right?

861
02:25:47,477 --> 02:25:48,436
No?

862
02:25:57,573 --> 02:25:58,908
Try this.

863
02:26:01,161 --> 02:26:02,829
What's the word...

864
02:26:03,372 --> 02:26:04,916
for beautiful?

875
02:27:44,127 --> 02:27:46,172
How did you get your name?

876
02:27:50,469 --> 02:27:53,390
I was not very old...

877
02:27:54,350 --> 02:27:56,811
when I came to be with the people.

878
02:27:57,645 --> 02:27:59,564
And I was made to work.

879
02:28:00,691 --> 02:28:02,818
I worked every day, very hard.

880
02:28:04,570 --> 02:28:07,951
There was a woman...

881
02:28:07,993 --> 02:28:09,995
who didn't like me much.

882
02:28:11,579 --> 02:28:15,668
She used to call me bad names,
and sometimes she...

883
02:28:20,258 --> 02:28:21,510
Beat me?

884
02:28:25,514 --> 02:28:27,267
And one day, she was...

885
02:28:28,101 --> 02:28:30,312
calling me these bad names...

886
02:28:30,688 --> 02:28:33,233
with her face in my face...

887
02:28:34,192 --> 02:28:35,528
and I hit her.

888
02:28:37,488 --> 02:28:40,617
I was not very big, but she fell down.

889
02:28:40,868 --> 02:28:43,078
She fell hard and didn't move.

890
02:28:44,497 --> 02:28:47,877
And then I stood over her with my fist...

891
02:28:48,085 --> 02:28:49,421
and I asked if...

892
02:28:49,838 --> 02:28:52,132
there was any other woman...

893
02:28:52,716 --> 02:28:55,011
who wanted to call me bad names.

894
02:28:56,929 --> 02:28:59,351
No one bothered me after that day.

895
02:29:02,396 --> 02:29:05,399
No, I wouldn't think so.

896
02:29:10,489 --> 02:29:11,866
Show me.

897
02:29:12,910 --> 02:29:14,912
Show me where you hit her.

898
02:29:43,658 --> 02:29:45,618
Why are you not married?

899
02:29:49,665 --> 02:29:51,166
- I'm sorry.
- I have to go.

900
02:29:54,088 --> 02:29:55,423
I'm sorry.

901
02:29:57,592 --> 02:29:58,760
Can I help you?

909
02:32:04,966 --> 02:32:06,134
I don't...

928
02:36:10,784 --> 02:36:12,702
Bet you were thinking:

929
02:36:12,786 --> 02:36:14,788
<i>Now, why don't he write?</i>

930
02:36:15,623 --> 02:36:17,292
Hello, Two Socks.

931
02:36:44,786 --> 02:36:46,037
Come on.

932
02:36:50,668 --> 02:36:54,256
I won't hurt you. Come on. You can do this.

933
02:36:54,631 --> 02:36:56,258
You can do this.

934
02:37:00,639 --> 02:37:01,808
Come on.

935
02:37:13,948 --> 02:37:15,409
This is easy.

936
02:37:15,951 --> 02:37:17,870
This is easy, Two Socks.

937
02:38:39,309 --> 02:38:40,977
I am in mourning.

938
02:38:50,324 --> 02:38:51,825
No, we cannot.

939
02:38:52,117 --> 02:38:55,038
- Yes.
- We must be careful.

940
02:38:57,082 --> 02:38:58,501
We must be careful.

941
02:38:58,584 --> 02:39:00,045
Okay.

942
02:40:03,878 --> 02:40:04,962
Wait!

943
02:42:11,250 --> 02:42:12,335
What?

944
02:42:13,169 --> 02:42:14,378
Trouble.

945
02:42:38,034 --> 02:42:41,455
The Pawnee are coming.
A big party of 40 or 50 men this time.

946
02:42:41,538 --> 02:42:44,043
Hunters found them not far to the north.
Soon be here.

959
02:44:15,703 --> 02:44:16,704
Okay!

960
02:46:51,571 --> 02:46:53,072
Shoot the gun!

961
02:51:20,962 --> 02:51:23,090
<i>It was hard to know how to feel.</i>

962
02:51:23,173 --> 02:51:25,759
<i>I'd never been in a battle like this one.</i>

963
02:51:25,843 --> 02:51:28,513
<i>There was no dark political objective.</i>

964
02:51:28,596 --> 02:51:32,602
<i>This was not a fight for territory
or riches or to make men free.</i>

965
02:51:32,686 --> 02:51:36,607
<i>It was fought to preserve the food stores
that would see us through the winter.</i>

966
02:51:36,649 --> 02:51:41,113
<i>To protect the lives of women and children
and loved ones only a few feet away.</i>

967
02:51:41,363 --> 02:51:45,034
<i>Stone Calf was a great loss,
but even the old men could not remember...</i>

968
02:51:45,118 --> 02:51:47,079
<i>such a one-sided victory.</i>

969
02:51:47,163 --> 02:51:50,125
<i>And I gradually began
to look at it in a new way.</i>

970
02:51:50,333 --> 02:51:52,878
<i>I felt a pride I'd never felt before.</i>

971
02:51:53,670 --> 02:51:56,507
<i>I'd never really known who John Dunbar was.</i>

972
02:51:56,841 --> 02:51:59,387
<i>Perhaps the name itself had no meaning.</i>

973
02:51:59,471 --> 02:52:02,640
<i>But as I heard my Sioux name
being called over and over...</i>

974
02:52:02,682 --> 02:52:05,561
<i>I knew for the first time who I really was.</i>

1037
02:59:17,913 --> 02:59:21,626
<i>The whole village was eager
to take up a collection on my behalf.</i>

1038
02:59:21,751 --> 02:59:24,712
<i>The generosity of the
people was astonishing.</i>

1039
02:59:24,754 --> 02:59:28,133
<i>The more valued the gift,
the more easily it was given.</i>

1040
02:59:28,259 --> 02:59:32,598
<i>Even the poorer families wanted to give
up animals they could not afford.</i>

1041
02:59:32,723 --> 02:59:34,935
<i>It was hard to turn them away.</i>

1042
02:59:39,649 --> 02:59:41,693
<i>Black Shawl was a mystery.</i>

1043
02:59:42,443 --> 02:59:45,949
<i>I couldn't guess what she was thinking
and she offered no advice...</i>

1044
02:59:46,449 --> 02:59:48,494
<i>no words of encouragement.</i>

1045
02:59:54,293 --> 02:59:56,628
<i>I may have been the brunt
of an inside joke...</i>

1046
02:59:56,712 --> 02:59:59,049
<i>that included the entire village...</i>

1047
02:59:59,174 --> 03:00:01,010
<i>but I was determined.</i>

1048
03:00:04,347 --> 03:00:07,768
<i>Wind In His Hair told me if all the
gifts were gone in the morning...</i>

1049
03:00:07,810 --> 03:00:09,937
<i>my offer had been accepted.</i>

1050
03:00:10,982 --> 03:00:15,236
<i>I spent a sleepless night
wondering what misstep, if any, I had made.</i>

1051
03:00:16,155 --> 03:00:19,491
<i>I had no idea
what Kicking Bird's decision would be.</i>

1065
03:01:53,655 --> 03:01:55,032
And for me.

1067
03:02:17,061 --> 03:02:19,147
<i>I had never been married before.</i>

1068
03:02:19,231 --> 03:02:22,150
<i>I don't know if all grooms
have the same experience...</i>

1069
03:02:22,234 --> 03:02:26,615
<i>but as Kicking Bird began to speak about
what was expected of a Sioux husband...</i>

1070
03:02:26,657 --> 03:02:30,453
<i>my mind began to swim in a way that
shut out everything but her...</i>

1071
03:02:30,495 --> 03:02:32,790
<i>the tiny details of her costume...</i>

1072
03:02:32,873 --> 03:02:34,959
<i>the contours of her shape...</i>

1073
03:02:35,209 --> 03:02:37,129
<i>the light in her eyes...</i>

1074
03:02:37,296 --> 03:02:39,340
<i>the smallness of her feet.</i>

1075
03:02:40,049 --> 03:02:42,886
<i>I knew that the love
between us would be served.</i>

1077
03:02:54,359 --> 03:02:55,361
Yes.

1080
03:03:05,124 --> 03:03:06,417
Good.

1082
03:03:17,014 --> 03:03:18,057
Bye.

1083
03:03:23,480 --> 03:03:24,523
Bye.

1129
03:13:42,991 --> 03:13:45,786
You have everything from the soldier fort?

1130
03:13:46,036 --> 03:13:47,079
Yes.

1131
03:13:47,413 --> 03:13:49,540
There's nothing for me there.

1133
03:14:05,520 --> 03:14:06,897
The journal.

1134
03:14:09,149 --> 03:14:10,860
Stands With... Wait!

1135
03:14:11,236 --> 03:14:12,403
Words are important!

1136
03:14:12,487 --> 03:14:14,865
The words in the book
are like a trail for people to follow.

1137
03:14:14,907 --> 03:14:18,703
Now, it tells everything about my life here.
I must get it.

1138
03:14:18,912 --> 03:14:20,081
Enough.

1140
03:14:34,641 --> 03:14:36,853
I'll catch up.

1141
03:15:18,490 --> 03:15:19,616
Injun!

1142
03:15:20,033 --> 03:15:21,534
Get him! Injun!

1143
03:15:27,168 --> 03:15:28,169
No!

1144
03:15:49,780 --> 03:15:51,990
Stay down. Stay.

1145
03:15:52,366 --> 03:15:53,785
My God.

1146
03:15:54,453 --> 03:15:55,704
God.

1147
03:16:01,378 --> 03:16:02,629
It's okay.

1152
03:17:10,592 --> 03:17:11,969
Spivey.

1153
03:17:12,846 --> 03:17:15,057
- Spivey!
- Yeah, Sergeant.

1154
03:17:16,142 --> 03:17:18,353
Tell the major he's waking up.

1155
03:17:20,271 --> 03:17:22,191
Move your worthless ass.

1156
03:17:33,747 --> 03:17:35,792
You got yourself a hell of a shiner...

1157
03:17:36,584 --> 03:17:37,877
didn't you?

1158
03:17:37,961 --> 03:17:40,048
Major's coming through.

1159
03:17:50,143 --> 03:17:52,021
Does he speak English?

1160
03:17:52,188 --> 03:17:53,816
I don't know, sir.

1161
03:17:55,609 --> 03:17:57,404
Speak English?

1162
03:17:59,197 --> 03:18:01,784
Talk English? Talk!

1163
03:18:03,536 --> 03:18:05,164
I speak English.

1164
03:18:09,711 --> 03:18:11,088
Who are you?

1165
03:18:13,257 --> 03:18:17,470
Lt. John J. Dunbar. This is my post.

1166
03:18:18,054 --> 03:18:19,765
Why are you dressed like this?

1167
03:18:22,019 --> 03:18:25,857
I came out from Fort Hayes last April,
but there was nobody here.

1168
03:18:26,441 --> 03:18:28,443
Do you have proof of that?

1169
03:18:30,988 --> 03:18:35,286
My journal's on the bunk in my quarters.
My orders are in the journal.

1170
03:18:35,369 --> 03:18:37,496
It will tell you everything.

1171
03:18:37,788 --> 03:18:40,417
Spivey, you and Edwards
were the first ones here.

1172
03:18:40,500 --> 03:18:42,837
Did you find anything? A journal?

1173
03:18:43,171 --> 03:18:45,508
No, we didn't find nothing, sir.

1174
03:18:45,925 --> 03:18:47,511
Where's Edwards?

1175
03:18:48,011 --> 03:18:49,471
He's outside.

1176
03:18:54,101 --> 03:18:56,522
He didn't find nothing either.

1177
03:19:00,735 --> 03:19:03,072
Somebody find me Edwards.

1178
03:19:11,833 --> 03:19:13,544
You turned Injun, didn't you?

1179
03:19:18,633 --> 03:19:20,010
Didn't you?

1180
03:19:24,683 --> 03:19:26,936
What did you say your name was?

1181
03:19:27,645 --> 03:19:28,814
Dunbar.

1182
03:19:29,898 --> 03:19:32,317
D-u-n-b-a-r. John.

1183
03:19:32,401 --> 03:19:34,404
You say you're an officer?

1184
03:19:34,654 --> 03:19:38,493
- God. Did you read my orders?
- No.

1185
03:19:39,160 --> 03:19:41,246
They're in my journal.

1186
03:19:41,496 --> 03:19:43,207
There are no orders.

1187
03:19:43,666 --> 03:19:45,418
There's no journal.

1188
03:19:49,840 --> 03:19:51,886
Why are you out of uniform?

1189
03:19:54,263 --> 03:19:56,016
I have to relieve myself.

1190
03:19:59,227 --> 03:20:01,981
- Sergeant, take care of him.
- Yes, sir.

1191
03:20:03,608 --> 03:20:04,819
Let's go.

1192
03:20:08,823 --> 03:20:10,993
- He's a white man.
- Doesn't look white to me.

1193
03:20:11,785 --> 03:20:14,789
- They say he's a soldier.
- He's an officer.

1194
03:20:14,873 --> 03:20:16,708
Do you salute him or shoot him?

1195
03:20:25,720 --> 03:20:27,598
Here, you. Eyes front.

1196
03:20:33,481 --> 03:20:35,107
I said eyes front!

1197
03:20:37,152 --> 03:20:39,613
Don't shoot him! Hit him! Get him!

1198
03:20:39,696 --> 03:20:40,989
Get him!

1199
03:21:31,472 --> 03:21:33,474
Why are you out of uniform?

1200
03:21:37,480 --> 03:21:38,982
What's the army doing out here?

1201
03:21:40,025 --> 03:21:42,612
- Lieutenant's asking the questions.
- Bauer.

1202
03:21:48,869 --> 03:21:51,206
We're charged with apprehending...

1203
03:21:54,127 --> 03:21:57,589
We're charged with apprehending hostiles
and recovering stolen property...

1204
03:21:57,672 --> 03:22:00,468
retrieving white captives
taken in hostile raidings.

1205
03:22:00,551 --> 03:22:04,515
- There are no hostiles.
- We will ascertain that for ourselves.

1206
03:22:04,599 --> 03:22:07,644
If you'll guide us to these camps
and serve as an interpreter...

1207
03:22:07,686 --> 03:22:10,105
your conduct will be re-evaluated.

1208
03:22:10,606 --> 03:22:12,651
- What conduct?
- With all due respect...

1209
03:22:12,692 --> 03:22:15,987
Your status as a traitor might improve
should you choose...

1210
03:22:16,071 --> 03:22:18,825
to cooperate with the United States Army.

1211
03:22:20,619 --> 03:22:22,956
There's nothing for you to do out here.

1212
03:22:26,585 --> 03:22:29,088
Are you willing to cooperate or not?

1213
03:22:31,842 --> 03:22:33,344
Speak up!

1215
03:22:42,689 --> 03:22:43,564
What's that?

1218
03:23:02,382 --> 03:23:06,052
Sergeant, form a detail
and take this man down to the river.

1219
03:23:06,929 --> 03:23:09,765
- Let him clean up his face.
- Yes, sir.

1220
03:23:11,853 --> 03:23:13,354
Not you, Spivey.

1221
03:23:41,432 --> 03:23:42,767
Lieutenant.

1222
03:23:45,354 --> 03:23:47,314
Major wants to see you.

1223
03:24:21,609 --> 03:24:23,027
Spivey.

1224
03:24:28,033 --> 03:24:30,079
Spivey. You got paper?

1225
03:24:30,705 --> 03:24:34,167
- What's it to you?
- Give me some, shit-bird.

1226
03:24:34,543 --> 03:24:35,585
Can you read?

1227
03:24:35,752 --> 03:24:37,963
No, I can't read.
What the hell's the difference?

1228
03:24:38,046 --> 03:24:41,009
You can't read either.
Now just give me some.

1229
03:24:41,509 --> 03:24:45,348
- Quick, give me some!
- All right. Hold your horses.

1230
03:26:07,496 --> 03:26:08,664
Bauer!

1231
03:26:12,293 --> 03:26:13,586
Let go of me!

1232
03:26:21,848 --> 03:26:24,727
Lap it up, Injun. Go ahead. Lap it up.

1233
03:26:27,480 --> 03:26:29,232
You son of a bitch!

1234
03:26:32,154 --> 03:26:33,655
It's all right.

1235
03:26:34,364 --> 03:26:35,907
It's all right.

1236
03:26:36,491 --> 03:26:40,663
He's going to get hungrier, that's all.
But maybe that don't matter.

1237
03:26:41,457 --> 03:26:44,461
Word is they're going to
ship you back to Hayes.

1238
03:26:44,544 --> 03:26:47,214
And once you get there,
they gonna hang you.

1239
03:26:50,886 --> 03:26:53,889
Come on. Forget about him.
Go on. Get out of here.

1240
03:27:08,992 --> 03:27:10,161
Get up in there!

1241
03:27:36,153 --> 03:27:38,155
Spivey, what is that?

1242
03:27:38,572 --> 03:27:40,742
Looks like he's following us.

1243
03:27:40,993 --> 03:27:42,744
Hell, I'm going to shoot him.

1244
03:27:43,870 --> 03:27:45,039
Dang. You missed him.

1245
03:27:46,082 --> 03:27:49,002
- Don't shoot, damn it. It's my shot.
- Wait. I seen him first.

1246
03:27:49,086 --> 03:27:50,922
- Get down!
- Look at that stupid bastard.

1247
03:27:51,006 --> 03:27:52,757
He ain't even moving.

1248
03:27:53,299 --> 03:27:56,929
- Wait a minute! That's my shot.
- Shoot him!

1249
03:27:58,014 --> 03:28:00,475
Shoot him, Edwards. He's standing there.

1250
03:28:00,934 --> 03:28:01,810
Shoot him!

1251
03:28:05,149 --> 03:28:07,234
Jesus Christ! Holy shit!

1252
03:28:11,823 --> 03:28:13,659
Bauer, get him off him!

1253
03:28:20,460 --> 03:28:22,004
He might have killed you.

1254
03:28:29,847 --> 03:28:31,350
I'll get that son of a bitch.

1255
03:28:37,940 --> 03:28:39,610
Sit down, goddamn it!

1256
03:28:51,958 --> 03:28:53,544
That's it. I got him!

1257
03:28:57,049 --> 03:28:59,177
Dead shot, boys. Come on.

1258
03:29:00,595 --> 03:29:02,138
Son of a bitch!

1259
03:29:02,723 --> 03:29:03,933
Get up!

1260
03:29:05,601 --> 03:29:06,686
Get up!

1261
03:29:08,230 --> 03:29:10,024
I mean it! Get up!

1262
03:29:10,108 --> 03:29:12,111
Get up! Come on, get up!

1263
03:29:12,653 --> 03:29:13,696
What?

1264
03:29:13,779 --> 03:29:17,033
You bash that prisoner one more time,
I'll put those shackles on you.

1265
03:29:18,076 --> 03:29:20,245
You men get back here!

1266
03:29:23,875 --> 03:29:25,253
Goddamn it!

1267
03:30:03,927 --> 03:30:04,845
Boo.

1268
03:30:13,397 --> 03:30:15,693
Clear behind that stand of trees?

1269
03:30:19,907 --> 03:30:21,658
All right. Let's go.

1270
03:30:45,189 --> 03:30:46,482
I don't see nobody.

1271
03:31:05,214 --> 03:31:06,425
Indians!

1272
03:34:49,130 --> 03:34:50,089
No.

1293
03:40:14,468 --> 03:40:17,305
<i>With Ten Bears,
it was always more than a while.</i>

1294
03:40:17,388 --> 03:40:21,184
<i>There was purpose in everything he did
and I knew he wanted me to stay.</i>

1295
03:40:21,267 --> 03:40:22,937
<i>But I was sure of myself.</i>

1296
03:40:23,020 --> 03:40:27,193
<i>I would be an excuse and that's all
the army would need to find this place.</i>

1297
03:40:27,276 --> 03:40:29,946
<i>I pushed him as far as I could
to move the camp...</i>

1298
03:40:30,029 --> 03:40:33,408
<i>but in the end he only smiled
and talked of simple pleasures.</i>

1299
03:40:33,492 --> 03:40:37,747
<i>He reminded me that at his age
a good fire is better than anything.</i>

1300
03:40:38,164 --> 03:40:40,585
<i>Ten Bears was an extraordinary man.</i>

1301
03:41:21,930 --> 03:41:23,807
You have nothing to say?

1302
03:41:26,185 --> 03:41:27,979
What can I tell you?

1303
03:41:29,647 --> 03:41:31,609
What's ever on your mind.

1304
03:41:38,242 --> 03:41:40,245
You've made the decision.

1305
03:41:44,709 --> 03:41:46,503
My place is with you.

1306
03:41:47,463 --> 03:41:49,132
I go where you go.

1307
03:41:52,678 --> 03:41:54,347
You're not afraid?

1308
03:41:55,431 --> 03:41:56,474
No.

1309
03:41:59,938 --> 03:42:03,025
I told Ten Bears
we'd leave when the snow breaks.

1310
03:42:10,158 --> 03:42:12,037
Did you tell everyone?

1311
03:42:16,084 --> 03:42:17,543
Not everyone.

1313
03:43:29,261 --> 03:43:30,638
You...

1314
03:43:31,681 --> 03:43:33,225
finish your pipe?

1315
03:43:46,367 --> 03:43:47,661
Good pipe.

1316
03:43:49,162 --> 03:43:50,497
How...

1317
03:43:51,040 --> 03:43:52,416
does it smoke?

1318
03:43:55,545 --> 03:43:57,089
I've never smoked it.

1319
03:44:08,895 --> 03:44:10,272
We come far...

1320
03:44:10,690 --> 03:44:12,025
you and me.

1321
03:44:14,737 --> 03:44:16,614
I will not forget you.

1326
03:47:50,182 --> 03:47:52,184
Sergeant! Over here! Now!
