This is the beginning of the tape.

00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:58,397
We're on mono and we're on microphone 1.

4
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:02,320
Okay.

5
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:03,563
Now listen,

6
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:06,158
let me tell you something that I did.

7
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,329
I've had my head digitized.

8
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,831
And they put this laser

9
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:14,746
and it goes around you like this...

10
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,834
and they digitized my face.

11
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:18,920
And I made a lot of faces

12
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,252
and smiled and...

13
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:23,671
and made a sad face and...

14
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,794
So they've got it all on digital.

15
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,468
And actors are not going to be real,

16
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,933
they're going to be inside a computer.

17
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,469
You watch, it's gonna happen.

18
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:37,189
So maybe this is the swan song
for all of us.

POLICE OFFICER: Copy. All available

35
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,354
MALE REPORTER:
Police came to a call to 911,

36
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:08,572
but this was no ordinary address,

37

the caller no ordinary citizen.

00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:13,531
Marlon Brando was on the line

39
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:15,700
to report a shooting at his home.

43
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,336
for his performance in the 1954 film

44

<i>On the Waterfront.</i>

45
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,255
He was already being acclaimed

46
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,008
as the greatest American
film actor ever.

47

You can bet that Marlon Brando's impact

00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,692
on the world of movie acting

53
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,861
will still be felt 500 years from now.

he can't refuse.

say he did not witness it.

58

put a spotlight on the private life

most reclusive stars.

to try to preserve sanity

62
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,555

63
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,425
that is taken away from you by success.

64

BRANDO: It will be
a highly personalized documentary

65
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:45,836
on the life activities of myself,
Marlon Brando.

66
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,213
We establish that he is a troubled man,

67
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:56,972
alone, beset with memories,

68
00:04:57,088 --> 00:05:01,969
in a state of confusion and sadness,

69
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,812
isolation, disorder.

70
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:10,060
He's wounded beyond being able

71
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:12,901
to be social in an ordinary way,

72
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:16,116
he becomes like a mechanical doll.

73
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,364
Maybe he felt that he was treated badly.

74
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:24,658
And that he's angry about the treatment.

75
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:29,376
He's collecting bits
of information here, odd bits of film

76
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:32,796
to try to explain why are you this way?

way back in time

82
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,030
to a time when you were very young,

83
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:03,155
when you used to wake up in the morning,

84
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,748
put on your clothes

85
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,583
while everyone was sleeping,

86
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:11,664
and walk down the sidewalk in Omaha

87
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,379
and sit underneath that big elm tree.

88
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,799
With the wind blowing the light,

89
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,672
the shadow of leaves.

90
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:25,386
It is like a wonderful, soft dream

91
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,262
and that soft wind calling.

92
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,899
That's a wind that you can trust.

93
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,321
You are the memories.

94
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,874
I've always in my life had

95
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:52,121
a strong sense that I had to be free.

96
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:56,633
Standing on that train, I was free.

97
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,797
I used to love to stand in the car

98
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,674
and listen to the rails.

99

(MIMICS RHYTHM OF A TRAIN'S MOVEMENT)

100
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:11,598
You know?

101
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:13,691
It's an eccentric kind of rhythm.

102
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:20,866
I arrived in New York with holes
in my socks and holes in my mind.

103
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:27,159
I remember getting drunk,

104
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,999
lying down on the sidewalk
and going to sleep.

105
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,789
Nobody bothered me.

106
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:38,007
I was always somebody who had

107
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,469
an unquenchable curiosity about people.

108
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,305
I liked to walk down the street
and look at faces.

109
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:48,094
I used to go to the comer
of Broadway and 42nd Street

110
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,641
in an Optimo cigar store.

111
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:54,479
I would watch people for three seconds
as they went by

112
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,694
and try to analyze their personality

113
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,688
by just that flick.

114
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:05,156
The face can hide many things.

115
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:08,576
And people are always hiding things.

116
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,250
I was interested to guess

117
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:15,541
the things that people
did not know about themselves.

118
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:20,759
What they feel, what they think,
why they feel.

119
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:24,379
How is it that we behave the way we do?

120
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,010
What is the answer?

121
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,635
Is there any answer?

122
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,683
There is something
that you need very deeply.

123
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,852
Some kind of contact,

124
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:38,273
some experience
to give you a sense of fulfillment.

125
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,981
I had a great feeling of inadequacy,

126
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,403
that I didn't know enough,

127
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,027
that I didn't have enough education.

128
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,281
I felt dumb.

129
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:04,177
I became an actor

130
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,422
pretty much by accident.

131
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:08,966
I went to the New School
for Social Research,

132
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,890
which is an extraordinary institution
of learning.

133
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,355
My teachers were all Jewish,

134
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:18,271
because the New School
was a clearing house

135
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:21,937
for Jews that escaped from Hitler.

136
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,485
They were very respected people.

137
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,488
The cream of academia.

138
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:32,201
Control over your lives

139
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,666
begins with this class.

140
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:36,205
BRANDO: I studied with a woman

141
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:38,829
by the name of Stella Adler.

142
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,626
She was a fine actress,

143
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:43,296
a really wonderful actress.

144
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:46,007
The smell of the greasepaint

145
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,846
and lure of the theatrical experience

146
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,762
came out in her teaching technique.

147
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:53,760
ADLER:
The play has nothing to do with words.

148
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,429
You do not act words,

149
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,518
you act with your soul.

150
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,308
BRANDO: I was very shy when I was a kid.

151
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,936
Sensitive, very sensitive.

152
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,153
ADLER: In the theater,

153
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,814
the actor is the boss.

154
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:10,695
It's against the nature of human life
to withdraw.

155
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,826
BRANDO: "Don't be afraid," she said.

156
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,075
"You have a right to be who you are,

157
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:18,201
where you are and how you are."

158
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:22,126
ADLER:
Be in a state of honesty up there.

159
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,921
BRANDO:
Allowing yourself to feel things,

160
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,294
to feel love or to feel rage.

161
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,295
ADLER: Speak out the thoughts

162
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,047
that are tormenting you.

163
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,343
BRANDO: Everybody's got a story to tell,

164
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:36,182
something they're hiding.

165
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,476
ADLER: Do not bring anything
in the present

166
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,188
that doesn't have the past.

167
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,733
BRANDO: We develop the technique
of acting very, very early.

168
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:47,652
Even from the time we're a kid,

169
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,945
where we're throwing our oatmeal
on the floor

170
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,410
just to get attention from our mothers.

171
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:55,497
Acting is surviving.

172
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,007
Yeah, that's my mother.

173
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:07,546
That photograph there.

174
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,130
This is a portrait of my mom

175
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,256
when she was about forty.

176
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:16,430
And she was a marvellous person.

177
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:21,603
For instance, she dressed up a pet goose
we had for Santa Claus.

178
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,107
She made a Santa Claus out of it,

179
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,897
made a little red costume for it

180
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,520
and a beard and everything.

181
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:29,857
She was a very inventive
and artistic woman.

182
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,904
And I miss her very much.

183
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,239
I was given by my mother

184
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,161
a sense of the absurd.

185
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:42,794
She had false teeth.

186
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:44,128
Once in a while she'd laugh.

187
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,497
While she was laughing,

188
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:48,091
her teeth would come off her gums.

189
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,084
And the more I laughed,

190
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,961
the more she thought it was funny

191
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,884
and we both ended up laughing real hard.

192
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:04,311
My mother taught me a love for nature,

193
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:09,563
and a sense of closeness with animals.

194
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,607
You couldn't think of a tune

195
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:15,368
she couldn't play on the piano.

196
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:16,862
Not one.

197
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:20,536
I like remembering about her.

198
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:27,172
I used to love the smell of liquor
on her breath.

199
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:30,633
And her breath becomes very, very sweet.

200
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,173
It's a lovely fragrance.

201
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,679
My mother was an alcoholic.

202
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,475
We lived in a small town

203
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,018
and my mother was the town drunk.

204
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:49,311
She began to dissolve

205
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,437
and fray at the ends.

206
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,068
When my mother was missing.

207
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,911
Gone off someplace,
we didn't know where she was.

208
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,662
I used to have to go
and get her out of jail.

209
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,122
Memories even now

210
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:08,543
that fill me with shame and anger.

211
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,802
ADLER: You have to constantly act.

212
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,592
It is not important

213
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:19,307
to defend your faults in the theater.

214
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:22,052
It's important to overcome them.

215
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:27,899
BRANDO: Stella very kindly invited me
into her home.

216
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:31,816
I then became part of her family.

217
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:36,070
When I was really suffering

218
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,989
and disjointed, disoriented with life,

219
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:42,497
she was always very loving towards me.

220
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,454
I'd never done anything in life

221
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:49,205
that anybody ever said I was good at.

222
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,582
She put her hand on my shoulders

223
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:53,754
and said, "Don't worry, my boy."

224
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,010
"I have seen you,

225
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:59,131
and the world is going to hear from you."

226
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,602
INTERVIEWER:
From the T-shirt clad Stanley Kowalski

227
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:13,023
<i>in Streetcar Named Desire,</i>

228
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,772
the role which catapulted him
to international fame,

229
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,690
we're very pleased
to have with us this morning

230
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,200
as our guest Mr Marlon Brando.

231
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,789
<i>BRANDO: Streetcar Named Desire
was very satisfying to be in,</i>

232
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,162
because I thought
it was a wonderful play.

233
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,245
The story was superb

234
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,792
and the production was wonderful.

235
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,291
You must be Stanley.

236
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:37,760
Oh, hiya. Where's the little woman?

237
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:42,224
BRANDO: It was a very explosive part

238
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,513
and it electrified everybody.

239
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:45,806
You want a shot?

240
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,517
BLANCHE: No, I rarely touch it.

241
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,811
Well, some people, they rarely touch it,

242
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,608
but it touches them often.

243
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,232
BRANDO: I was quite nutty
when I was young

244
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:57,572
and I would have a lot of energy.

245
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,448
Rain forever.

246
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,363
BRANDO:
'Cause you couldn't come out flat,

247
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:03,031
you couldn't come out slow.

248
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,620
After the play was over,

249
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,614
I felt like a million bucks.

250
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,830
I was off into the night

251
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,665
with sparkles and zest

252
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,751
to see whatever I could find.

253
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,168
How wonderful it was to drive around

254
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:21,011
on a motorcycle with just a T-shirt on.

255
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,757
Two, three, four o'clock in the morning.

256
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:29,271
Some small club
in the black section of town.

257
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,264
And I was screaming

258
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,107
when they were playing those drums.

259
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,147
I'd hear that shit,

260
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:40,399
it just used to take me to another land.

261
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,116
This is my moment,

262
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:43,655
I want to take this moment

263
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,450
and that was wonderful.

264
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,617
And then your life changes.

265
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,085
Suddenly, there's a lot more girls

266
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,045
saying, "Hi, Mar."

267
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:57,540
When I was younger,

268
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:00,301
I was a fairly attractive kid.

269
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:03,467
I had a lot of derring-do and panache.

270
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:07,263
I was unpredictable and stimulating

271
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,680
for a lot of young girls.

272
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:11,183
(MIMICS CAT'S SCREECH)

273
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:17,061
BRANDO: I was young and destined
to spread my seed far and wide.

274
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:19,608
Girls and fun and good food

275
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:22,778
and sense of health and purpose...

276
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,742
It can't get better than this.

277
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:28,246
Nothing in life
could be better than this.

278
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:32,371
I was always making jokes and teasing,

279
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,871
playing practical jokes on everybody.

280
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,130
(LAUGHS)

281
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,518
To be able to have money.

282
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,012
I never had any money.

283
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,852
My father was a traveling salesman.

284
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:59,816
I was making more in six months of work

285
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:01,688
than he made in ten years.

286
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:04,440
He measured everything by money.

287
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:07,739
He couldn't understand
how this ne'er-do-well son of his

288
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,533
could possibly do that.

289
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,125
If I have a scene to play

290
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:16,665
and I have to be angry,

291
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:20,586
there must be within you trigger
mechanisms that are spring-loaded,

292
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:24,210
that are filled with contempt
about something.

293
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:27,301
I remember my father hitting my mother.

294
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:28,806
I was fourteen.

295
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:37,565
Now that's how
I'm gonna clear the table.

296
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,728
Don't you ever talk that way to me.

297
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,277
BRANDO: My old man was tough.

298
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:46,820
He was a bar fighter.

299
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:49,820
He was a man with not much love in him.

300
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,489
Staying away from home,

301
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:55,833
drinking and whoring
all around the Midwest.

302
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:58,453
He used to slap me around,

303
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,251
and for no good reason.

304
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:03,796
And I was truly intimidated by him
at that time.

305
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,336
Now what kind of a queen
do you think you are?

306
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,554
You know that I've been onto you
from the start,

307
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:11,800
and not once did you pull the wool
over this boy's eyes.

308
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,677
BRANDO: When things
are extremely painful to you,

309
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,804
you don't want them
in your consciousness,

310
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,806
you want to forget about them.

311
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,399
And you are the Queen of the Nile,

312
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,610
sitting on your throne,
swilling down my liquor.

313
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:25,697
You know what I say? Ha-ha!

314
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:29,405
BRANDO: You can imagine
having to go someplace every night

315
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,822
and go through all that,

316
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:32,453
get yourself upset...

317
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,789
To have to cry or to scream

318
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:38,705
or to be ruined in some way,
that's work.

319
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,124
That's hard work.

320
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,998
People invariably associated me
with the part I played,

321
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:47,635
so that it was difficult to believe
that I didn't eat off the floor,

322
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:52,474
or that I, you know, didn't run up
the street with my shoes off,

323
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:56,015
and so it's been a hard thing
sort of living that down.

324
00:18:56,844 --> 00:19:00,439
There is nothing about me
that is like Stanley Kowalski.

325
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:01,933
I hate that kinda guy.

326
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,810
I absolutely hate that person

327
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:06,232
and I couldn't identify with it.

328
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:12,244
The brute, dark character that
represented the beasts and the animals.

329
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,997
They sent me to a psychiatrist.

330
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,866
They thought I was going nuts,

331
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:21,286
losing my mind.

332
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,538
Stella told me,
if you come to the theater

333
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:26,792
and you feel a hundred percent,
show eighty.

334
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:30,716
If you come and you feel sixty percent,
show forty.

335
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,176
If you come to the theater

336
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,470
and you only feel forty percent,

337
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,844
best to turn around and go home.

338
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,187
INTERVIEWER:
I was wondering if you have any plans

339
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,602
to return to the stage
in the near future.

340
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:48,571
BRANDO: No, I don't have any immediate
intentions of returning to the stage.

341
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,906
(TAPE RECORDER CLICKS)

342
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,999
BRANDO: The shouts of freedom

343
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:03,586
are also the rattling of chains.

344
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:09,467
BRANDO:
You seem to be such a restless man.

345
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,881
Eyes always darting.

346
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,219
BRANDO: I don't know,

347
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:16,136
I guess I've just got loose feet.

348
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:22,514
INTERVIEWER: I infer from that that you
do not thoroughly enjoy your profession.

349
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,478
Or you don't enjoy it at all.

350
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,942
BRANDO: No, I think that people
do what they enjoy,

351
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,276
or else they don't do it.

352
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,362
People do what they want to do.

353
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,404
If there are adverse conditions
that surround my work,

354
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:36,152
they are not adverse enough

355
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,912
to make me change activities.

356
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:44,748
If I hadn't had the good luck
to be an actor,

357
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:47,839
I don't know what I would've been.

358
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,878
I'd have probably been a con man.

359
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,593
A good con man.

360
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:57,181
Tell smooth lies, give impressions
of things that he thinks,

361
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:00,434
or appears to think
that he doesn't think.

362
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,978
Since I don't do anything else well,

363
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,473
and up to this time I haven't decided

364
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:06,941
what else I would like to do,

365
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,855
I might as well put all my energies

366
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,399
into being as good an actor as I can.

367
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,782
WOMAN:
Now will you turn your head for us?

368
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,117
Sure.

369
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:20,204
WOMAN: Now around the other way.

370
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,826
Now all the way around.

371
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:34,173
All right. Thank you and stay around.

372
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:37,680
BRANDO: Shakespeare said,

373
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,470
"There is no art to find

374
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,718
the mind's construction in the face."

375
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,436
And there should be such an art.

376
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,854
When the camera is close on you,

377
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,773
your face becomes the stage.

378
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:54,522
Your face is the proscenium arch

379
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:56,900
of the theater, thirty feet high.

380
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,945
And it sees all the little movements

381
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:03,494
of the face and the eye and the mouth.

382
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:06,208
You have the intensity to act.

383
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:10,329
I wanted very much

384
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:13,378
to be involved in motion pictures,

385
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,046
so I could change it

386
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:17,462
into something nearer the truth.

387
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:20,214
And I was convinced
that I could do that.

388
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,809
About my playing the tuba...

389
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:26,270
Seems like a lot of fuss
has been made about that.

390
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,101
BRANDO: In the '30s and '40s

391
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:30,645
you had a particular kind of acting.

392
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,064
You knew who you were gonna get

393
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,028
when you went to the movies.

394
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,986
Gary Cooper oats.

395
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:39,821
Shredded Wheat Bogart.

396
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:43,412
Clark Gable Crunchy Fruit Loops.

397
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,281
They were just like breakfast cereals.

398
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,412
The same in every role.

399
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:52,122
Gestures of anguish and despair,

400
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:55,216
and that kind of acting became absurd.

401
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,383
The astounding thing

402
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:01,926
most people don't realize.

403
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,683
All motion pictures today,

404
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,268
all acting today,

405
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:08,521
stems from Stella Adler.

406
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:12,149
INTERVIEWER: Stella, so much
has been talked about Method acting.

407
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:14,109
What exactly is the Method?

408
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:17,821
All right, let's start at the beginning.

409
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,282
BRANDO: Stella went to Paris

410
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:23,786
and studied
with Konstantin Stanislavsky,

411
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,325
the great Russian teacher,

412
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,240
brought back
her experience and knowledge

413
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,455
of this particular form of acting.

414
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:35,332
Reality, realness, carried by an actor

415
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,337
to achieve the truth.

416
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,968
This is the most modern technique.

417
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,422
BRANDO: Everything that you do,

418
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:43,798
make it real as you can.

419
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:46,176
Make it alive, make it tangible,

420
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,678
find the truth of that moment.

421
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:51,180
Mr Stanislavsky understood that.

422
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:55,314
BRANDO: And the style of acting
changed completely.

423
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:59,526
The first movie I ever did
was called The Men.

424
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:01,365
<i>L played a paraplegic</i>

425
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,944
and lived in a hospital
with paraplegics for three weeks.

426
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:08,744
Physicality is a tough thing.

427
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:12,831
I spent a lot of time just studying
everything they do.

428
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:16,001
I wanted to see how
they got in and out of their chairs.

429
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:19,167
The manner in which you crawled
from one place to another.

430
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:23,838
Paraplegics,
they do the most amazing things.

431
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:26,216
Races without their chairs,

432
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,092
I've seen guys walk on their hands.

433
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:29,639
They can do one-armed pull-ups,

434
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:31,054
they can do everything.

435
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,851
You have to know your subject,

436
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,599
you have to know your character.

437
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,772
Putting yourself
in a different state of mind.

438
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,857
What they felt like,

439
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:41,401
what their frustrations were

440
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,816
knowing that they couldn't have sex.

441
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:46,410
BRANDO AS KEN:
What am I gonna do, where am I gonna go?

442
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,534
I can't go out there anymore.

443
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:54,039
BRANDO: He just sits there
and he marinates his mind.

444
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,958
In the intellect; that's all he's got.

445
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,376
Put your heart into it.

446
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:00,712
Get yourself up emotionally.

447
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,715
At night I think about it,

448
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:05,053
dream about it

449
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:07,840
and I wake up being absorbed by it.

450
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:09,683
People have routines:

451
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,679
acting routines, dancing routines,
painting routines.

452
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:15,147
The same thing over and over again.

453
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,687
Everything is a cliché.

454
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:21,855
When an actor takes a little too long
as he's walking to the door,

455
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:24,152
you know he's going to stop
and turn around and say...

456
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:27,152
"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn."

457
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:29,449
BRANDO:
Jersey Joe Walcott, terrific fighter.

458
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:33,206
He'd be boxing, he'd be throwing
some punches and bing!

459
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,413
He'd have his fist in somebody's face.

460
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:37,453
You'd think it was coming out
of the southwest

461
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,462
and there it comes out of the northeast.

462
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,542
He would never let you know
where he was going to hit you.

463
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:43,960
You.

464
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:47,930
BRANDO: Never let the audience know
how it's gonna come out.

465
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:49,048
What is your name?

466
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:51,096
BRANDO: Get them on your time.

467
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:55,437
Emiliano Zapata.

468
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:01,360
BRANDO: And when that time comes
and everything is right,

469
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,904
you just fuck, let fly.

470
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:07,321
O judgment, thou art fled
to brutish beasts,

471
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:09,239
and men have lost their reason.

472
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,906
BRANDO: Hit them, knock them over.

473
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:13,156
With an attitude,

474
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,953
with a word, with a look.

475
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,326
I don't like cops.

476
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:18,668
BRANDO: Be surprising.

477
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:21,335
Figure out a way to do it

478
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:22,957
that has never been done before.

479
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,629
You gotta put something down,

480
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,797
you gotta make some jive.

481
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,716
Don't you know what I'm talking about?

482
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:31,807
BRANDO: You want to stop that movement
from the popcorn to the mouth.

483
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:37,681
Cry "Havoc,"
and let slip the dogs of war.

484
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:39,603
BRANDO: Get people to stop chewing.

485
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:44,479
That this foul deed
shall smell above the earth.

486
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:46,693
BRANDO: The truth will do that.

487
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,697
Damn, damn, damn, damn.

488
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:52,411
When it's right, it's right.

489
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,113
You can feel it in your bones.

490
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,915
Then you feel whole,

491
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,500
then you feel good.

492
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,417
It was pre-sixties.

493
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:05,667
People were looking for rebellion,

494
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:08,715
and I happened to be at the fight place
at the right time

495
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:10,713
with the right state of mind.

496
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:14,892
In a sense, it was my own story.

497
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:17,477
Rebelling for the sake of rebelling.

498
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:37,786
WOMAN: Hello, Mr Brando.

499
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:40,876
I hope you don't think
I'm too crazy for making this recording.

500
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:42,586
I wrote you a fan letter once,

501
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,462
but I don't know if you received it.

502
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:49,551
Once I saw a picture of you
with a white cat. Was it yours?

503
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:53,556
I'll bet you're one of the kindest,
most interesting fellows in Hollywood.

504
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:55,808
I suppose I'm judging the book
by the cover,

505
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:58,723
but perhaps I'm not too far wrong.

506
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:01,723
Mr Brando?
I hope this isn't too personal,

507
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:05,067
but I always say what I think,
so I won't stop now.

508
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,528
I admire you very much,

509
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:09,571
both as an actor and a person.

510
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:12,274
Many, many other people
feel the same way.

511
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,493
I think one of the main reasons
that I admire you

512
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,612
is because you aren't afraid
to be yourself,

513
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:19,452
instead of being a carbon copy
of everyone else.

514
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:20,950
It would be a pretty dull world

515
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,826
if everyone behaved in the same way,

516
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:25,795
so three cheers for you, Mr Brando.

517
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:34,839
BRANDO: I didn't intend to have
that extraordinary effect.

518
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:39,764
I became, very quickly, a cult hero.

519
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:55,321
And now I know that you're as anxious
as I am to find out what actor

520
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:59,663
has won the Oscar
for the best perfonnance of this year.

521
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,740
The winner is

522
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:04,626
<i>Marlon Brando for On the Waterfront.</i>

523
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:09,589
REPORTER: Marlon Brando,

524
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,921
an actor of very considerable talent.

525
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:15,012
The youngest actor
ever honoured in this way.

526
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,134
BRANDO: When I saw the picture finally,

527
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:21,932
I was so embarrassed,

528
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:24,430
so disappointed in my performance.

529
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:28,855
It's much heavier than I imagined.

530
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:32,821
It's like carrying a monkey around
on your back.

531
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:36,192
They're asking me to put the finger
on my own brother.

532
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:41,330
BRANDO: It's a very strange thing
this business of storytelling.

533
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,536
You don't always know when you're good.

534
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:46,664
You wanna hear my philosophy of life?

535
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:52,208
Do it to him before he does it to you.

536
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,585
BRANDO: People will mythologize you

537
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,508
no matter what you do.

538
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:00,173
There's something absurd about it,

539
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,427
that people go with hard-earned cash

540
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:05,179
into a darkened room

541
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:08,686
where they sit
and they look at a crystalline screen

542
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:12,649
upon which images move around
and speak.

543
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,982
And the reason they don't have light
in the theater

544
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:20,111
is because you are there
with your fantasy.

545
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:23,201
The person up on the screen

546
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:26,371
is doing all the things
that you want to do,

547
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,493
they're kissing the woman
you want to kiss,

548
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,336
hitting the people you want to hit,

549
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:33,499
being brave in a way
that you want to be brave.

550
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:38,304
The audience will lend themselves
to the subject.

551
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:42,595
They will create things
that are not there.

552
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:44,639
Listen to me, Terry, take the job.

553
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,728
Just take it. No questions, take it.

554
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:50,061
BRANDO: There are times I know
I did much better acting

555
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:52,230
<i>than in that scene
from On the Waterfront.</i>

556
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:53,728
You don't understand.

557
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:55,737
I coulda had class.

558
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:57,694
I coulda been a contender.

559
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,984
I coulda been somebody.

560
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,702
Instead of a bum.

561
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:05,076
Which is what I am, let's face it.

562
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:08,371
BRANDO: It had nothing to do with me.

563
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:10,244
The audience does the work,

564
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,463
they are doing the acting.

565
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:15,207
Everybody feels like they're a failure,

566
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:18,799
everybody feels
they could've been a contender.

567
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:20,671
Inferiority.

568
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:23,882
I've been very close to it all my life.

569
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,689
ED MURROW: Marlon,
I know your dad is in town tonight.

570
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:32,649
Is he hiding out somewhere?

571
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:34,768
BRANDO: No, I'll get him in here. Pop?

572
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:36,278
Come on out.

573
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:38,773
ED MURROW: We'll ask Mr Brando
some questions about his son

574
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:41,658
and I'm sure we'll get
the blunt and direct answers.

575
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:43,027
Good evening, Mr Brando.

576
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:46,621
I imagine you're just a bit proud
of your son right now, aren't you?

577
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:52,168
Well, as an actor not too proud,

578
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:55,255
but as a man, why, quite proud.

579
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:56,840
ED MURROW: Mr Brando, tell me this.

580
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,418
Was he hard to handle as a child?

581
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:01,796
FATHER: I think he had the usual...

582
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:05,341
childhood traits.

583
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,809
I think he had probably a little more

584
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:11,772
trouble with his parents
than most children do.

585
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,399
ED MURROW: Marlon, in the interests
of justice and fairness,

586
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:17,440
would you like 30 seconds
to defend yourself?

587
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:19,563
Well, I don't feel
I need to defend myself.

588
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:22,362
I can lick this guy with one hand, so...

589
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,072
Let it go.

590
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:30,116
BRANDO: We had an act
we put on for each other.

591
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,083
I played the loving son

592
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,830
and they played the adoring parents.

593
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:38,795
There was a lot of hypocrisy.

594
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:44,259
When what you are as a child
is unwanted, it's unwelcome,

595
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:48,555
then you look for an identity
that will be acceptable.

596
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:53,146
So I had a wide variety
of perfonnances in me.

597
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,774
ED SULLIVAN: I'm very anxious for you.

598
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:58,940
I know you haven't seen
all of the footage,

599
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,233
but your light comedy performance

600
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:04,278
<i>in Guys and Dolls
is really terrific, Marlon.</i>

601
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,446
Well, I hope so.

602
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,240
I'm very anxious to see it.

603
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,237
In fact, I'm dying to see it.

604
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,660
How was Vegas?

605
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:14,375
Paradise. For two weeks I gambled
in green pastures,

606
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:15,585
the dice were my cousins

607
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:18,831
and the dolls were agreeable
with nice teeth and no last names.

608
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:21,421
You don't believe I'm a sinner, do you?

609
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:24,670
I'm prepared to believe that you are the
biggest sinner I ever met in my life.

610
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:29,304
BRANDO: It's part of an actor's trade
to be able to play in a light vein

611
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:33,554
and be an entertainer
as well as a serious storyteller.

612
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:38,730
And I feel that I perhaps have neglected
that part of my career up to this point.

613
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:43,864
When I go to set I have a lot of fun,
because it's a gay affair.

614
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,524
It's pleasant to look forward to,

615
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:47,151
it's a nice way to spend your day,

616
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:51,075
rather than be in the middle of a miasma
of seriousness and gravity.

617
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:55,914
As a kid, when I used to sell bottles
and cut lawns

618
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:59,626
to get my ten cents to go to the movie,

619
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,874
and I would escape everything.

620
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,885
That sense of good feeling,

621
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:12,222
that got me through the week.

622
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:16,347
Those moments were magical.

623
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:25,189
REPORTER: The glittering world premiere
at New York's Capitol Theater

624
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:30,194
for Samuel Goldwyn's multi-million
dollar production of Guys and Dolls.

625
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:34,786
# Your eyes are the eyes

628
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:49,633
<i>it Why try to deny...</i>

629
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:53,475
BRANDO: Most actors
want to get their name in the paper.

630
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:56,562
They like all that attention.

631
00:34:57,512 --> 00:35:01,437
<i>I very often am struck
with the illusion of success.</i>

632
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,486
Sometimes it's difficult
when you meet people

633
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:07,277
because you see
that they have prejudged you,

634
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:09,695
not to be treated normally.

635
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:13,741
To have people staring at you
like an animal in a zoo,

636
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:17,036
or some strange creature
from a distant land.

637
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:20,827
What it does is remove you from reality.

638
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,499
(FANS SCREAM)

639
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:29,970
I can't stand it. I hate it.

640
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:32,756
I had no idea of how discomforting it is

641
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:36,017
not to be able to be
just an ordinary person.

642
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:38,520
You can't imagine
how much of a panic it is.

643
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:39,889
Really, it scared me to death,

644
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:41,390
because they were hanging on,

645
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:44,233
they could've been run over or crushed.
It really is...

646
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,861
I've never seen
a really hysterical crowd.

647
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,355
It's a frightening experience.

648
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:58,077
BRANDO: Relax, Marlon.

649
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,866
And breathe deeply now.

650
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:07,507
You don't need to feel frightened,

651
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:09,843
you don't need to be nervous.

652
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:21,521
You're very, very comfortable.

653
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:26,360
Deeply safe,
like when you were with Ermi,

654
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:29,480
when you slept in her arms,

655
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,572
when you received affection.

656
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,863
Remember those feelings.

657
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:41,120
She was a governess
hired by my mother.

658
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:45,337
Lovely Oriental skin.

659
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,672
She had very fine hair.

660
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,588
She was sleeping,

661
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:53,633
and through the windows
came the moonlight,

662
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:56,677
and illuminated her body.

663
00:36:57,799 --> 00:37:02,726
I remember arranging myself
on her, over her,

664
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:06,316
and thinking that she was all mine,

665
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:08,561
that she belonged to me alone.

666
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:16,448
Everybody wants a guarantee
that their love is going to be returned.

667
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:18,536
"I'm going to love you till I die

668
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,497
and we're going to love each other
forever."

669
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:26,836
All of those adolescent and childish
concepts of what love ought to be.

670
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:32,550
I remember the night she left.

671
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:33,964
She went away to get married,

672
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,258
but to a seven-year-old mind,

673
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,256
having been with someone intimately,

674
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:41,931
it was tantamount to desertion.

675
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:45,097
In a sense, my mother left me,

676
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:47,478
because she was alcoholic.

677
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,272
And so did Ermi.

678
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:56,775
It was from that date that I became
a miscreant, badly behaved.

679
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:04,120
- CAMERAMAN: Okay.
- Okay.

680
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,159
I'd like to begin by asking you

681
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:10,126
what consumes your thoughts
in your spare time, when you have any?

682
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,082
Well, my thoughts are...

683
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:13,959
INTERVIEWER: What do you do?

684
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:17,087
I'm interested in your face.

685
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:19,965
You're one of the prettiest
interviewers that I've...

686
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,181
INTERVIEWER: Thank you.

687
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,393
You're one of the most gracious hosts
I've ever met.

688
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,387
- Oh really?
- INTERVIEWER: Yes.

689
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:27,560
I hope to see you in Chicago.

690
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,806
(LAUGHTER)

691
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:31,230
- We'd like to see you in Chicago.
- We?

692
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:33,440
Is that the collective "we"
or is that the...

693
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:36,030
There are many people
who would like to see you in Chicago.

694
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,616
- But you don't?
- Certainly, I do.

695
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,954
Well, I'm representing WNAC in Boston

696
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:45,745
and our viewing audience
would love to know why you're here

697
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:48,038
and for you to tell us
about your latest movie.

698
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,412
Excuse me,
I didn't mean to touch your ankle.

699
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:56,051
Well, what can I tell you about it?

700
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:58,132
INTERVIEWER:
Oh, just some interesting things

701
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,883
that our audience would like to hear...

702
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:03,599
You talk out of the side of your mouth,
did you ever notice that?

703
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:06,185
- INTERVIEWER: No, I...
- You talk... It's channing.

704
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,561
NTERVIEWER: Unintentional.

705
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,645
It's a physical idiosyncrasy,
but it's a charming one.

706
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:14,856
We can't see your right eye.

707
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:17,527
Talking from the side of my mouth?

708
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:18,944
Wouldn't want to do that.

709
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:24,785
Would you like to tell us about behind
the scenes while making the picture?

710
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,577
How far behind the scenes?

711
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:28,245
(LAUGHTER)

712
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:34,084
BRANDO: Answer me something, is it true?

713
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:38,005
There are some rumors about you
and Marlon Brando having a romance, huh?

714
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:39,878
WOMAN: Oh no, we're just good friends.

715
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,296
BRANDO: Just good friends?

716
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:44,306
Well, it seems the other night,
you were going into Mr Brando's room

717
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:47,719
and not coming out until early morning.
Is that true?

718
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,604
WOMAN: Well, yes, it's true,

719
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:52,599
but he is a perfect gentleman.

720
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:55,022
BRANDO: He's a perfect gentleman. I see.

721
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:58,022
Is it true there was some love making
going on there?

722
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:01,821
The people in the next room seem to
have heard some thumping about and...

723
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:05,787
and some rattling of the bed itself.

724
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:07,451
WOMAN: Well, I slept with him.

725
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:10,200
BRANDO: You slept with him?
Well, I don't...

726
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:11,542
WOMAN: In the same bed.

727
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:15,163
BRANDO: Well, I don't know if we can
talk about this over the air, I mean...

728
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:17,632
I hope you folks listening in
will not be...

729
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:20,047
WOMAN: Just close your ears.

730
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:25,473
WOMAN 2:
You have what most men want.

731
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,809
You have a lady to fuck,

732
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:31,681
you have a woman who loves you,
you have a...

733
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:34,432
(BRANDO LAUGHS)

734
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,526
WOMAN 2: Guilty, aren't you?

735
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:45,489
BRANDO: I'm not guilty.

736
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:49,953
It's just the... It's the tequila.

737
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:52,167
- WOMAN 2: It's the what?
- BRANDO: It's the tequila.

738
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,535
WOMAN 2: I got it.

739
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:59,045
BRANDO: Past a certain point,
the penis has its own agenda.

740
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:01,630
It has nothing to do with you

741
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:05,847
and a lot of your decisions are made
by your penis and not by your brain.

742
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,842
REPORTER:
I'd like to show you a wedding picture.

743
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:13,063
A wedding that took place
on October 11th, 1957.

744
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,681
The man is Marlon Brando.

745
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:19,152
The woman? A young Indian actress
and a model, Anna Kashfi.

746
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:23,277
BRANDO: A good con man can fool anybody.

747
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:26,368
And the first person that you fool

748
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:28,324
as a con man is yourself.

749
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,914
She found out about other women
in my life

750
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:37,083
and I had women coming in the door,
going out the window...

751
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:40,958
The beast aspect of my personality
held sway

752
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:46,805
and overtook anything that was
reasonable, rational, moral or decent.

753
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,350
Because if you haven't ever been loved,
or ever known love,

754
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,227
you'll never know where it is.

755
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,597
You don't know what it looks like
or sounds like.

756
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:58,316
You look in the most unlikely places
to find it.

757
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:02,149
REPORTER:
Marriage lasted but a few months,

758
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,443
but a child was born out that coupling.

759
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,152
Christian Devi.

760
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:10,244
BRANDO:
I can remember the baby breathing...

761
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,363
(BREATHES GENTLY)

762
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,828
Little tiny baby like that...

763
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,951
Then listening to the heart.

764
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:22,875
I didn't want my father
to get near Christian.

765
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:28,759
The day he was born, I said it to myself
with tears in my eyes in the hospital,

766
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:31,640
"My father is never going
to come near that child,

767
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:34,602
because of the damage he did to me."

768
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:44,063
INTERVIEWER:
Can I move on to your own acting career

769
00:42:44,187 --> 00:42:46,565
and how your moral beliefs
have affected it?

770
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:50,577
<i>For example, we associate you
with roles like On the Waterfront,</i>

771
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:54,072
where you are a man
who is fighting a righteous cause,

772
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:55,289
a sort of underdog,

773
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,500
you've got the whole union machine
against you,

774
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:00,411
<i>and then there's the roles
like the rebel leader in Viva Zapata!</i>

775
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,080
Where you are for the poor.

776
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,964
Do you deliberately choose these roles?

777
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:08,258
Over your career you've deliberately
chosen roles that have

778
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:10,505
gone along with your political beliefs?

779
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,260
Yes, I think so.

780
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:20,982
NARRATOR: On December 23rd, 1787,

781
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:23,522
His Majesty's ship, Bounty,
sailed from England

782
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:25,361
bound for the South Seas,

783
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:27,901
culminating in the most famous mutiny
in history.

784
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,990
CAPTAIN BLIGH:
You can put it in one word. Fear.

785
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,985
Fear of punishment so vivid in his mind

786
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,908
that he fears it even more
than certain death.

787
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:36,201
In my years of service,
I have never met an officer

788
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:39,872
who inflicted punishment upon men
with such incredible relish.

789
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:42,541
It's sickening.

790
00:43:43,538 --> 00:43:47,418
Then go and be sick in your cabin,
Mr Christian.

791
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:48,964
BRANDO: Human hatred.

792
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:50,337
What is the answer?

793
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:53,055
Is there any answer to injustice?

794
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:56,722
I wanted to make pictures
that are meaningful to me.

795
00:43:56,843 --> 00:43:59,062
CAPTAIN BLIGH:
You'd best join my war, Mr Christian,

796
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:00,771
for if I don't start winning soon,

797
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:02,890
the casualty list will be real enough.

798
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:07,562
BRANDO: You bring part of yourself
to every character,

799
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:11,403
but some parts
are closer to us than others.

800
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:18,994
Is the story true about
you going to school in Minneapolis?

801
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:22,335
I went to a military academy called...

802
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:26,130
Well, I won't tell you the name.

803
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:27,499
I had a terrible time there.

804
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:33,342
BRANDO: My father sent me
to military school, away from home,

805
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:36,557
the one he had attended.

806
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:39,894
It was a cruel and unusual punishment.

807
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:45,187
The mind of the military has one aim:

808
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:48,895
to be as mechanical as possible.

809
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:52,732
To function like a human machine.

810
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:57,904
Individuality simply did not exist.

811
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:02,208
I had a lot of loneliness.

812
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:07,756
I spent most of the time
up in the library

813
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:12,628
reading the National Geographic
magazine about Tahiti.

814
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:17,599
I was entranced
by the expressions on their faces.

815
00:45:17,757 --> 00:45:20,180
They had unmanaged faces,

816
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:22,554
no manicured expressions.

817
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,937
A kindness.

818
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:27,520
That's where I want to go,

819
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:29,235
that's where I want to be.

820
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:41,455
<i>When I made Mutiny on the Bounty,</i>

821
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:44,826
finally I got a chance to go to Tahiti.

822
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,093
I'd fallen in love with Tahiti.

823
00:45:58,214 --> 00:46:00,091
It was everything I longed for,

824
00:46:00,216 --> 00:46:02,344
everything I hoped it would be.

825
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:08,482
As soon as they'd say cut,

826
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:11,148
I'd take off my jacket,
dive into the water

827
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:14,899
and swim under the boats
and play on the beach.

828
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:20,953
The sky... I've never see a sky like it.

829
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:24,870
And the sunsets defy words.

830
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:27,119
My God.

831
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,088
I've only been here a short time.

832
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:33,583
I have been puzzled
every time I see Tahitians,

833
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:36,632
because I can't figure out
what they're thinking.

834
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:40,173
When you watch Tahitians,
it's like watching a wave,

835
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:43,598
or the wind in the palm tree,
or the palm tree itself.

836
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:47,146
They'll bring their drums
and their skirts,

837
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:48,480
and they'll laugh and dance

838
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,562
and drink and make love.

839
00:46:50,725 --> 00:46:52,443
Full of laughter.

840
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:57,315
CAPTAIN BLIGH: Mr Christian.

841
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,744
Kindly satisfy your lust elsewhere.

842
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:05,664
Quite actually, sir,
we were simply discussing...

843
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:06,915
Acknowledge the order.

844
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:11,704
Lust to be satisfied elsewhere, sir.

845
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,418
Report on board immediately.

846
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:19,504
You bloody fool.

847
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:25,135
<i>BRANDO: Mutiny on the Bounty
was perhaps my very worst experience</i>

848
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:27,227
in making a motion picture.

849
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:31,191
I never want to do that kind of picture
again as long as I live.

850
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:35,148
Nobody was agreed when we went in.

851
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:38,614
We all knew that it was impossible
to shoot that story.

852
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:41,530
It won't work. That will never work.

853
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:45,621
You can't have Christian standing aside
not doing anything.

854
00:47:45,738 --> 00:47:48,457
Keep him alive in the story.

855
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:55,044
<i>I was never consulted
before the writing was done.</i>

856
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:58,043
And I cared a great deal
about this picture.

857
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:02,593
You put your life in the hands
of the director,

858
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,590
because the director can screw you up.

859
00:48:04,757 --> 00:48:07,226
You're going too lightly, Quintal.

860
00:48:07,343 --> 00:48:09,562
Lay on with a will
or you'll take his place.

861
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,598
BRANDO: They can't direct actors,

862
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:15,476
they don't know what the process is.

863
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:21,199
How delicate it is
to create an emotional impression.

864
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:25,991
They cover up their sense of inadequacy
by being very authoritative,

865
00:48:26,112 --> 00:48:28,365
commanding things.

866
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:31,959
INTERVIEWER: Didn't he say he wanted
to talk to you and explain it to you?

867
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:36,172
BRANDO: He wanted to give me
a long "no", and I favor short "noes".

868
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:37,335
INTERVIEWER: No, I did...

869
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:40,960
BRANDO: You can't argue with somebody
who's made up their mind.

870
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:44,555
Don't ever be intimidated by directors.

871
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:50,682
You bloody bastard.

872
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:52,976
You'll not put your foot on me again.

873
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:56,522
There was a great deal of friction,
confusion and desperation,

874
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:58,440
disappointment and disgust,

875
00:48:58,561 --> 00:48:59,858
there were fist fights.

876
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:02,235
Ship's company!

877
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,279
I'm taking command of this ship.

878
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,528
Mr Friar, I'll have the keys
to the arms chest.

879
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:08,495
You'll give him nothing!

880
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:12,742
BRANDO:
Hey! I'm not your fucking stamp licker.

881
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:14,665
You're making a huge error.

882
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,002
Don't make it again.

883
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,964
I don't care if it costs me my job.

884
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:22,335
Marlon, talk about rage.

885
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:25,054
Talk about your own rage.

886
00:49:25,171 --> 00:49:29,472
All my life I've questioned
why I should do something.

887
00:49:29,592 --> 00:49:31,344
I had contempt for authority.

888
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:33,096
I would resist it, I would trick it,

889
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:35,723
I would outmaneuver it, I would do anything

890
00:49:35,848 --> 00:49:38,772
rather than be treated like a cipher.

891
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:41,354
REPORTER:
Marlon Brando has been the subject

892
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:43,982
of a good deal
of controversial publicity.

893
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:45,824
He's been called a supreme egotist,

894
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,610
uncooperative, temperamental.

895
00:49:47,735 --> 00:49:50,784
I've rarely seen
such a range of vicious critiques.

896
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:55,622
BRANDO: They were blaming me
for all the delays and everything.

897
00:49:55,743 --> 00:49:57,461
They had to blame it on somebody,

898
00:49:57,578 --> 00:49:59,205
so they blamed it on me.

899
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:02,504
Well, everybody has to have
a whipping boy and certainly the studio.

900
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:04,798
They have to find a scapegoat,

901
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:06,466
they have to find somebody.

902
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:09,010
I was the most logical person.

903
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:13,644
The sickening and endless variety
of lies.

904
00:50:13,761 --> 00:50:15,855
They can hit you every day

905
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:18,641
and you have no way of fighting back.

906
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:23,689
I was very convincing
in my pose of indifference.

907
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:27,073
But I was very sensitive

908
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:29,193
and it hurt a lot.

909
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:50,514
There are times when you think,

910
00:50:50,631 --> 00:50:53,134
"What the fuck is all this for?"

911
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:55,432
"Christ, nobody's listening."

912
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:58,477
There's an old adage in Hollywood,

913
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:01,271
they say "if you have a message,
go to Western Union."

914
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,358
I didn't make any great movies.

915
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:06,401
There's no such thing as a great movie.

916
00:51:06,522 --> 00:51:08,445
In the kingdom of the blind,

917
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:10,534
the man with one eye is the king.

918
00:51:11,944 --> 00:51:13,287
There are no artists.

919
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:15,413
We are businessmen, we're merchants.

920
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:17,667
And there is no art.

921
00:51:19,952 --> 00:51:22,671
Agents, lawyers, publicity people...

922
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:25,424
It's all bullshit.

923
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,501
Money, money, money.

924
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:29,845
If you think it's about something else,

925
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:32,511
you're going to be bruised.

926
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:36,431
I do want to ask you one thing
before we run out of time, Marlon.

927
00:51:36,552 --> 00:51:37,974
You've been quoted
in the papers as saying

928
00:51:38,137 --> 00:51:39,559
that you are going to abandon acting.

929
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,182
Are you really going to do that?

930
00:51:41,307 --> 00:51:45,813
I feel that I'd like to pursue some
other interests that I have long had.

931
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:47,529
And within two or three years,

932
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:49,899
I will have come to the end
of my career.

933
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:53,986
We're all gonna talk about civil rights,

934
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:55,912
we're all gonna go on the television

935
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:57,657
and say what we know,

936
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:59,499
because the country is ignorant.

937
00:52:00,576 --> 00:52:02,624
(APPLAUSE)

938
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:07,296
lam really moved and motivated

939
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:10,966
by things that occur that are unjust.

940
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:16,601
I've always hated
people trampling on other people.

941
00:52:19,762 --> 00:52:21,059
I was in a quandary,

942
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:23,686
a philosophical quandary,
because I thought

943
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:27,528
if I am not my brother's keeper,
who am I?

944
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:32,867
Where does my life end and my sense
of responsibility for other lives begin?

945
00:52:34,443 --> 00:52:39,290
Black bodies swinging
in the summer breeze,

946
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:42,535
and the smell of burning death.

947
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,287
You could stand so much of it

948
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:45,503
and to see these people

949
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:48,545
being beaten and kicked and spit on.

950
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:51,627
That could've been my son lying there.

951
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:55,006
And I'm going to do as much as I can.

952
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:58,096
I'm going to start right now

953
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:02,308
to inform white people
of what they don't know.

954
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:04,557
The white man can't cool it

955
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:06,810
because he's never dug it.

956
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:08,982
And I am here to try to dig it.

957
00:53:10,396 --> 00:53:12,615
King was in Memphis at the time.

958
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:18,454
He was striking for a small wage
increase for garbage collectors,

959
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:21,912
which was one of the best jobs
a black man could get.

960
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:25,707
But I want you to know tonight

961
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:30,090
that we as a people
will get to the Promised Land.

I was up in the mountains on Tahiti.

And this guy said, "Do you see
that little island out there?"

991
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:21,193
And I said, "No, I can't see it."

992
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,453
He says, "Can't you see it?"

"it's called Tetiaroa."

I never was in a place that told me

995
00:55:31,787 --> 00:55:34,336
to quit running the way this place does,

996
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:36,458
the way these people do.

997
00:55:43,382 --> 00:55:48,183
If I've come closer to a sense
of peace, it would be there.

998
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:57,401
I didn't think of myself
as an owner of the island,

999
00:55:57,521 --> 00:56:01,025
I just thought that I'd paid
for the privilege of visiting there.

1000
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:04,153
I had nothing to give to them.

1001
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:06,580
They had everything to give to me.

1002
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:11,376
They don't care who you are,

1003

they don't care what you do.

They don't know
that you're a movie star.

and you brought him up in Tahiti,

he'd be a completely different kid.

1019

He wouldn't have this cruel, mean
society killing him every day,

You wouldn't believe

Your mind is going 10,000 mph.

You're lying at the speed of light.

You're lying to save your life.

1075

The last thing in the world
you want her to know is the truth.

You lie for peace,

Sensitivity is too high.

The sensitivity is too high.

1113
01:02:42,801 --> 01:02:48,058
The neurotic individual's entire
self-esteem shrinks to nothing

1114

if he does not receive admiration.

1115
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:55,776
To be admired and to be respected

1116
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:58,025
is a protection against helplessness

1117

I used to think I'd never grow up.

I thought that life would go on forever.

And then I worried,

somewhere in the middle years,

1124

life is going away and I haven't done
this and I haven't done that.

I've been denied that experience,

There was a famous dancer, Ulanova.

And she asked what would be her dream.

but the studio was fighting it.

1134

It was demeaning to do a screen test,

1135
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:26,363
but I needed a part at that time.

1136

I wasn't sure
I could play that part either.

I don't wanna get caught being afraid

That's gonna steal

You have to look at the cameraman,

the producer lurking in the comer

and say,
"I don't give a fuck about any of you."

And if by chance an honest man
like yourself should make enemies,

then they would become my enemies.

What is the nature of criminality?

Where does it come from?

1164
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:01,291

BRANDO: Smart con people find out

1276
01:12:19,085 --> 01:12:21,884
where you want to go emotionally.

1277
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:23,972
They find out what your direction is

1278
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:26,343
and then they help you along with that,

1279
01:12:26,467 --> 01:12:28,060
reinforcing it,

1280
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:31,226
guiding it to their own sweet ends.

1281
01:12:33,432 --> 01:12:36,732
Marlon, there is nothing to fear.

1282
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:40,153
It's very important
to trust in this process.

1283
01:12:41,065 --> 01:12:45,115
BERTOLUCCI:
Marlon, say something about your past.

1284
01:12:45,236 --> 01:12:47,955
Show in my film what you really are.

1285
01:12:50,575 --> 01:12:53,875
My father was a drunk.

1286
01:12:56,122 --> 01:12:57,590
Tough.

1287
01:12:57,707 --> 01:13:01,302
Whore-fucker, bar fighter,
super masculine.

1288
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:05,719
And it was tough.

1289
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,717
My mother was very...

1290
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:11,642
very poetic.

1291
01:13:11,762 --> 01:13:13,685
But also a drunk.

1292
01:13:13,806 --> 01:13:16,901
BERTOLUCCI: Go deeper and deeper...

1293
01:13:17,894 --> 01:13:20,647
Every time more and more real.

1294
01:13:23,691 --> 01:13:27,491
Marlon was invading
the character of Paul.

1295
01:13:31,282 --> 01:13:33,580
BRANDO:
You lied to me and I trusted you.

1296
01:13:33,701 --> 01:13:35,669
You lied and you knew you were lying.

1297
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:38,209
Go on, tell me something sweet.

1298
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:42,052
Smile at me and say...
I just misunderstood.

1299
01:13:43,586 --> 01:13:45,213
Go on, tell me.

1300
01:13:45,922 --> 01:13:49,096
BRANDO: Maybe you're desperate for love,

1302
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:54,522
But you've been distrustful of people.

1303
01:13:54,639 --> 01:13:56,812
Is there anything about them
that scares us,

1304
01:13:56,933 --> 01:13:59,982
that's dangerous, that's gonna hurt us?

1305
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:03,151
'Cause a lot of people
are frightened to death of love.

1309

I realized,
"You know you're naked, Marlon."

1310
01:14:29,966 --> 01:14:32,640
BERTOLUCCI: When he saw the movie,
he was shocked.

1311
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:35,555
He felt betrayed by me,

1312
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:40,902
because I stole from him
so many sincere things.

<i>Miss Sacheen Little-feather.</i>

1325
01:15:38,868 --> 01:15:43,214
Hello. I'm representing Marlon Brando
this evening

1326
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:44,957
and he has asked me to tell you

1327
01:15:45,082 --> 01:15:48,677
that he very regretfully cannot accept

1328
01:15:48,794 --> 01:15:51,798
this very generous award.

1329
01:15:51,922 --> 01:15:54,596
And the reasons for this being

1330
01:15:54,717 --> 01:15:57,812
are the treatment
of American Indians today

1331
01:15:57,928 --> 01:16:01,774
by the film industry... excuse me.

(BOOING AND APPLAUSE)

Thank you on behalf of Marlon Brando.

1335
01:16:17,782 --> 01:16:19,329
INTERVIEWER: Tell me then, way back,

1336
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:21,794
when you were interested
in the Indians' fishing fights

1337
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:25,381
before it was fashionable to be so,

1338
01:16:25,498 --> 01:16:27,250
what triggered that?

1339
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:31,046
What we have learned about the Indians
has been largely taught to us

1340
01:16:31,170 --> 01:16:34,390
by Hollywood and by motion pictures.

1341
01:16:34,507 --> 01:16:38,512
Seeing Indians represented as savage,

1342
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:41,476
as ugly, as nasty and vicious.

1343
01:16:42,306 --> 01:16:46,106
Everything we are taught about
the American Indian is wrong.

1344
01:16:48,145 --> 01:16:49,988
There have been 400 treaties

1345
01:16:50,106 --> 01:16:53,110
written by the United States
in good faith with the Indians

1346
01:16:53,234 --> 01:16:56,078
and every single one of them was broken.

1347
01:16:56,195 --> 01:16:59,665
We like to see ourselves
as perhaps John Wayne sees us.

1348
01:16:59,824 --> 01:17:03,169
That we are a country
that stands for freedom,

1349
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:05,879
<i>for tightness, for justice.</i>

1350
01:17:06,038 --> 01:17:08,257
It just simply doesn't apply.

1351
01:17:08,374 --> 01:17:11,344
And we were the most rapacious,

1352
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,383
aggressive, destructive,

1353
01:17:13,504 --> 01:17:17,350
torturing, monstrous people,

1354
01:17:17,508 --> 01:17:20,136
who swept from one coast to the other

1355
01:17:20,261 --> 01:17:23,891
murdering and causing mayhem
among the Indians...

But that isn't revealed,

1360
01:17:37,194 --> 01:17:39,413
'cause we don't like
that image of ourselves.

1361
01:17:40,865 --> 01:17:44,460
I don't think the Americans
want to face the truth.

1362
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:47,584
(WHISPERS)
We are all living on stolen land.

1363
01:17:49,748 --> 01:17:53,048

Where do you draw the line?

1366
01:17:57,882 --> 01:17:59,179
At what point do you say,

1367
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:01,644
"God damn it, this is my turf."

1368
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,012
"I was here first."

1369
01:18:03,137 --> 01:18:06,232
"One more step on this land
and you're gonna get it."

1370
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:12,439
I was with Indian armed resistance
in Kenosha, Wisconsin...

1371
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:16,984
insisting a piece of land
belonged to them.

Four feet away from death.

1378
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:36,254
There was an effort
on the part of the government

1379
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:39,382
to cover up the military involvement.

1380
01:18:39,506 --> 01:18:43,261
And any cover-ups
are going to be looked into.

1381
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:48,107
After Watergate and all that corruption
going on, we just can't afford it.

1392
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:17,674
They lie when they're alone,

1393
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:20,264
they lie when they're asleep.

1394
01:19:20,965 --> 01:19:24,970
They never see faces

of their son who died in Vietnam,

fighting for his country.

1414

They had parents so hogwashed

that rather than alter
their belief system,

1416
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:39,335
would kill their children.

1417

Conviction of the myth is everything.

1418

We need myths,

1419
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:48,018
we live by myths.

We die for myths.

1421
01:20:53,474 --> 01:20:56,694
I read the script and it was stupid.

1422

It was awful.

1423
01:20:59,605 --> 01:21:04,281

1426
01:21:13,243 --> 01:21:14,916
And I have it all on tape.

1427

I have a tape of everything.

1428

Here is a story note.

1429
01:21:19,041 --> 01:21:21,840
The guy has to be intelligent.

1430
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:23,678
He is without mercy,

1431
01:21:23,796 --> 01:21:25,890
not because he's a merciless man,

1432
01:21:26,006 --> 01:21:28,759
but simply because
that's the logic of it.

1437
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:44,241
without judgment, without judgment...

1438

BRANDO:
I told Francis how I wanted to be lit.

1439

BRANDO AS KURTZ: Horror has a face,

1444

BRANDO: And I felt myself coming apart,

1448
01:22:17,975 --> 01:22:20,444
splitting in two, and it scared me.

1449
01:22:23,272 --> 01:22:25,491
And yet I've gone so far.

1450

that I can ever return.

1452
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:35,951

1453
01:22:36,076 --> 01:22:37,623
why are you so frightened?

1454
01:22:37,744 --> 01:22:40,338
Let the fear take you.

1463
01:23:02,436 --> 01:23:05,030
had to contend with shooting
in the Philippine jungle,

1464
01:23:05,147 --> 01:23:08,151
a raging civil war and Marlon Brando.

1465
01:23:08,275 --> 01:23:11,199
Coppola was appalled
when Brando arrived grossly overweight

1466
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:12,822
and had to be filmed in shadowy light.

1467
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:15,161
COPPOLA:
He was already heavy when I hired him.

1468
01:23:15,282 --> 01:23:17,580
But he was so fat,
he was very, very shy about it.

1469
01:23:17,701 --> 01:23:20,295
REPORTER: But that was the least
of the director's problems.

1470
01:23:20,454 --> 01:23:22,377
Pulling his notorious delaying tactics,

1471
01:23:22,498 --> 01:23:24,000
Brando was up to his old tricks again

1472
01:23:24,124 --> 01:23:25,717
with endless script conferences,

1473
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:28,428
costing the production
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

1474
01:23:28,545 --> 01:23:32,425
COPPOLA: Clearly he had just
kind of left me in a tough spot.

1475
01:23:32,549 --> 01:23:35,018
BRANDO: Francis Coppola, he's a prick,

1476
01:23:35,135 --> 01:23:36,682
a card-carrying prick.

1477
01:23:36,803 --> 01:23:38,350
I mean the cocksucker.

1478
01:23:38,472 --> 01:23:40,190
How could he do that to me?

1479
01:23:40,307 --> 01:23:41,559
I saved his fucking ass

1480
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:43,902
and he shows his appreciation

1481
01:23:44,061 --> 01:23:46,905
by dumping on me.

1482
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:50,784
Let the tension flow out of you.

1483

Let it flow out of your mind.

1484
01:23:52,819 --> 01:23:54,742
Five, four...

1485

Far, distant laughter.

1490

And it's just after the sun
has gone down.

1491
01:24:13,173 --> 01:24:14,846
A star comes.

1492

The first star of the evening.

at this very deep, indescribable night.

I'm really...

1504
01:24:51,336 --> 01:24:53,805
I've taken too many fucking punches.

1505

What are you gonna give me?

1513
01:25:27,873 --> 01:25:31,298
I've made as much as 14 million dollars

1514
01:25:31,418 --> 01:25:34,922
for 12 days' work
on a rather silly movie.

1515

My friends, you know me to be
neither rash nor impulsive.

1516
01:25:39,259 --> 01:25:42,604
And I tell you that we must evacuate
this planet immediately.

And I had things that I'd much rather do

1520
01:25:50,687 --> 01:25:53,236
other than studying the fucking lines.

1521
01:25:54,399 --> 01:25:56,652
I have found this other way to do it.

1522
01:25:56,777 --> 01:25:58,324
I had a pocket recorder

1523
01:25:58,445 --> 01:26:01,995
and I had a thing in my ear,
like a hearing aid.

1524

Let's take a little walk.

1525

I got bum ears.

just a suggestion of a line,

It's effective.

1530

I was using it in that movie.

1531

I can't even remember the name of it.

Just think of all the good things
that you like.

1535
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:41,618
Like apple pie and ice cream

1536
01:26:41,738 --> 01:26:43,957
and brownies and milk.

1537
01:26:45,992 --> 01:26:48,916
But you must eat them

1538
01:26:49,037 --> 01:26:51,335
not quite so often.

When you get as fat as me,

1542
01:27:07,305 --> 01:27:08,682
you gotta start thinking,

1543
01:27:08,807 --> 01:27:11,185
"Well, what's the matter
with the machine?"

1544
01:27:11,309 --> 01:27:13,528
The machine isn't working right.

1545

It's something out of balance here.

1546

Food was always a friend.

1547
01:27:20,944 --> 01:27:22,662
When I was a kid,

1548
01:27:22,779 --> 01:27:24,076
I'd come home from school

1549
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:25,957
and I'd open the icebox

1550
01:27:26,074 --> 01:27:28,748
and there'd be apple pie in there

1551
01:27:28,869 --> 01:27:30,462
and cheese and...

1552
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:32,622
They'd say to me, "Come on, Mar,

1553
01:27:32,748 --> 01:27:34,625
why don't you be a pal and take me out?"

1554
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:36,752
"I'm freezing in here."

1555
01:27:38,128 --> 01:27:40,005
The dishes were in the sink

1556
01:27:40,130 --> 01:27:43,555
and the house was unkempt.

1557
01:27:45,719 --> 01:27:48,689
I had the fear that everybody was dead

1558
01:27:48,805 --> 01:27:50,807
and pretending to be alive.

1559

was punching my mother

1561
01:27:57,981 --> 01:27:59,608
and I went up the stairs

1562
01:27:59,733 --> 01:28:01,030
and I went in the room.

1563
01:28:01,151 --> 01:28:04,155
And I had so much adrenaline,

1564
01:28:04,321 --> 01:28:05,743
and I looked at him

1565
01:28:05,864 --> 01:28:08,868
and I fucking put my eyes
right through him

1566
01:28:08,992 --> 01:28:10,710
and I said, "if you hit her again,

I am going to kill you."

01:29:27,988 --> 01:29:30,457
I think that
perhaps I failed as a father.

1595
01:29:30,615 --> 01:29:33,710
And certainly there were things
that I could've done differently,

1596
01:29:33,827 --> 01:29:35,500
had I known better at the time.

1597
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:37,463
I am at fault in this.

1598
01:29:37,581 --> 01:29:41,336
And if I could trade places with Dag,
I would.

1599
01:29:41,459 --> 01:29:45,305
The total sentence imposed
is ten years in the state prison.

1600
01:29:46,590 --> 01:29:50,185
REPORTER: Cheyenne Brando is suffering
from mental and physical problems

1601
01:29:50,385 --> 01:29:53,138
and cannot travel here
to testify about what she knows.

1602
01:29:53,263 --> 01:29:55,561
Cheyenne is doing her best...

1603
01:29:59,895 --> 01:30:02,648
Excuse me... sorry.

1604
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:06,535
REPORTER: Another personal tragedy
for actor Marlon Brando.

1605
01:30:06,651 --> 01:30:09,074
His 25-year-old daughter Cheyenne

1606
01:30:09,195 --> 01:30:11,573
has committed suicide at her home
in Tahiti.

1607
01:30:11,698 --> 01:30:14,793
Cheyenne Brando reportedly
had made several suicide attempts

1608
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:17,083
before hanging herself yesterday.

1609
01:30:18,830 --> 01:30:20,207
REPORTER 2: For Marlon Brando,

1610
01:30:20,332 --> 01:30:24,087
Tahiti will never quite be
the same again.

1611
01:30:39,184 --> 01:30:43,234
When in disgrace
with fortune and men's eyes,

1612
01:30:43,355 --> 01:30:46,074
I all alone beweep my outcast state,

1613
01:30:46,191 --> 01:30:47,818
and trouble deaf heaven

1614
01:30:47,943 --> 01:30:50,287
with my bootless cries,

1615
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:53,790
and look upon myself and curse my fate.

1616
01:31:04,292 --> 01:31:06,920
BRANDO: There are times
when you wake up in the morning

1617
01:31:07,045 --> 01:31:10,675
and you turn over and feel,
"Shit! What a life."

1618
01:31:13,593 --> 01:31:15,345
God, I can't figure it out.

1619
01:31:15,512 --> 01:31:17,139
Why did it have to be this way?

1620
01:31:19,599 --> 01:31:20,976
I've had a hard year.

1621
01:31:22,727 --> 01:31:25,697
Maybe harder
than you could possibly imagine.

1622
01:31:31,903 --> 01:31:35,953
<i>You try to be as strong as you can be,</i>

1623
01:31:36,074 --> 01:31:39,954
but everybody reaches break point
sooner or later.

1624
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:45,584
Pain - I knew I had to deal with it.

1625
01:31:47,002 --> 01:31:53,180
I've spent thousands upon thousands
of dollars on psychoanalysts

1626
01:31:53,299 --> 01:31:56,894
and those guys do absolutely nothing

1627
01:31:57,012 --> 01:32:01,017
but stick pliers and screwdrivers
in your brain.

1628
01:32:03,226 --> 01:32:05,900
Life will have given me the truth

1629
01:32:06,021 --> 01:32:08,194
and taken in exchange

1630
01:32:08,314 --> 01:32:10,237
what's left of my youth.

1631
01:32:12,068 --> 01:32:14,366
It took me a while to realize,

1632
01:32:14,529 --> 01:32:16,827
you gotta be your own analyst.

1633
01:32:18,825 --> 01:32:20,793
Unless we look inwards,

1634
01:32:20,910 --> 01:32:24,960
we will not ever be able
to clearly see outwards.

1635
01:32:26,791 --> 01:32:29,294
Nobody is born evil.

1636
01:32:29,419 --> 01:32:33,469
Most people are simply
getting over bad emotional habits

1637
01:32:33,631 --> 01:32:36,931
established in the first ten years
of their life.

1638
01:32:40,055 --> 01:32:44,401
Christian was burdened
with emotional disorders

1639
01:32:44,601 --> 01:32:47,400
and psychological disarray.

1640
01:32:47,562 --> 01:32:50,065
The kind of trouble that I had in life.

1641
01:32:53,068 --> 01:32:55,617
I never tried to be like my father,

1642
01:32:55,737 --> 01:32:58,490
but one inadvertently takes on

1643
01:32:58,656 --> 01:33:01,580
the characteristics of one's parents.

1644
01:33:03,328 --> 01:33:05,251
When my father died,

1645
01:33:05,413 --> 01:33:08,007
I imagined that he was slump-shouldered,

1646
01:33:08,124 --> 01:33:11,503
walking to the edge of eternity.

1647
01:33:11,711 --> 01:33:13,839
He looked back and said,

1648
01:33:13,963 --> 01:33:15,886
"I did the best I could, kid."

1649
01:33:17,717 --> 01:33:19,469
Finally I forgave my father,

1650
01:33:19,636 --> 01:33:24,267
because I realized
that I was a sinner because of him.

1651
01:33:24,390 --> 01:33:25,642
But he was a sinner,

1652
01:33:25,767 --> 01:33:28,316
because his mother left him
when he was four.

1653
01:33:28,436 --> 01:33:30,063
He didn't have a chance.

1654
01:33:32,774 --> 01:33:35,744
And through introspection

1655
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:38,238
and the examination of my mind,

1656
01:33:38,363 --> 01:33:40,491
I feel as though I'm coming closer

1657
01:33:40,657 --> 01:33:42,534
to the common denominator

1658
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:44,748
of what it means to be human.

1659
01:33:49,499 --> 01:33:52,673
Everybody is capable of hatred,

1660
01:33:52,794 --> 01:33:55,217
everybody is capable of love.

1661
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:58,384
If we stretched ourselves
one way or another,

1662
01:33:58,550 --> 01:34:00,052
we could become murderers

1663
01:34:00,176 --> 01:34:02,099
or we could become saints.

1664
01:34:03,555 --> 01:34:05,557
I've done a lot of meditation.

1665
01:34:05,723 --> 01:34:09,023
The result is that
I have felt much calmer

1666
01:34:09,144 --> 01:34:12,819
and I've had moments
of real tranquility.

1667
01:34:14,149 --> 01:34:18,370
Don't you realize that you're thought of
as the greatest actor ever?

1668
01:34:18,486 --> 01:34:20,705
Tim's the greatest actor ever.

1669
01:34:20,822 --> 01:34:23,951
He pretends he loves me when he wants
something to eat. Get outta here.

1670
01:34:25,368 --> 01:34:29,123
BRANDO: Many times
I remember being down in the dumps

1671
01:34:29,247 --> 01:34:31,045
and then I saw a movie

1672
01:34:31,166 --> 01:34:34,136
that took me away for a few hours

1673
01:34:34,252 --> 01:34:36,755
and I was completely restored.

1674
01:34:38,590 --> 01:34:40,809
And I realized, oddly enough,

1675
01:34:40,925 --> 01:34:43,929
that actors make a contribution
to people's lives,

1676
01:34:44,053 --> 01:34:47,102
giving us a gift that you can't buy.

1677
01:34:48,016 --> 01:34:50,485
Something that they can imbue

1678
01:34:50,685 --> 01:34:52,938
with power and beauty and magnificence.

1679
01:34:53,062 --> 01:34:55,064
Something beyond themselves

1680
01:34:55,190 --> 01:34:56,988
and we do need that.

1681
01:34:58,568 --> 01:35:02,072
Acting is just making stuff up,

1682
01:35:02,197 --> 01:35:03,699
but that's okay.

1683
01:35:03,823 --> 01:35:05,621
Life is a rehearsal,

1684
01:35:05,742 --> 01:35:07,335
life is an improvisation.

1685
01:35:08,786 --> 01:35:12,256
I'm gonna have a special microphone
placed in my coffin,

1686
01:35:12,373 --> 01:35:14,876
so that when I wake up in there,

1687
01:35:15,001 --> 01:35:16,344
six feet under the ground,

1688
01:35:16,461 --> 01:35:19,135
I'm gonna say, "Do it differently."

1689
01:35:23,593 --> 01:35:27,063
Anthony. Come here, come here.

1690
01:35:29,432 --> 01:35:31,184
BRANDO: The death scene.

1691
01:35:31,309 --> 01:35:32,982
That's a tough scene to play.

1692
01:35:34,896 --> 01:35:38,776
You have to make them believe
that you're dying.

1693
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:42,120
I would hope it would be
with one person.

1694
01:35:42,237 --> 01:35:44,114
It would be something simple,

1695
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:46,617
like playing tiddlywinks

1696
01:35:46,783 --> 01:35:50,128
or... I don't know, jackstraws.

1697
01:35:51,246 --> 01:35:52,338
(MOANS)

1698
01:35:54,332 --> 01:35:56,676
- (ANTHONY CRIES)
- CORLEONE: Oh, no! (LAUGHS)

1699
01:35:58,086 --> 01:35:59,588
(CORLEONE LAUGHS)

1700
01:36:01,381 --> 01:36:04,055
BRANDO: Try to think
of the most intimate moment

1701
01:36:04,175 --> 01:36:06,177
that you've ever had in your life.

1702
01:36:07,637 --> 01:36:09,639
Run down in there. Run in there.

1703
01:36:11,099 --> 01:36:12,476
ANTHONY: Where are you?

1704
01:36:12,976 --> 01:36:14,523
(LAUGHS)

1705
01:36:16,479 --> 01:36:18,948
(COUGHS)

1706
01:36:39,877 --> 01:36:43,632
BRANDO: Marlon. Listen to my voice.

1707
01:36:44,674 --> 01:36:46,802
Just let go.

1708
01:36:47,719 --> 01:36:49,517
Just letting go.

1709
01:36:50,888 --> 01:36:52,390
Drift.

1710
01:36:52,515 --> 01:36:55,439
Drift like a cloud in the sky.

1711
01:36:57,603 --> 01:37:00,652
Drifting into that special state,

1712
01:37:00,815 --> 01:37:02,158
the state of peace

1713
01:37:02,275 --> 01:37:04,949
of the boy that you remember,

1714
01:37:05,069 --> 01:37:07,163
watching the elm leaves come down.

1715
01:37:13,202 --> 01:37:15,671
Don't hang on to thoughts,

1716
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:17,753
don't hang on to anything.

1717
01:37:19,751 --> 01:37:22,049
They're old tapes,

1718
01:37:22,170 --> 01:37:23,888
no longer usable,

1719
01:37:24,047 --> 01:37:25,344
no longer useful.

1720
01:37:26,924 --> 01:37:28,642
Chuck 'em.

1721
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:31,639
Put 'em aside. You don't need 'em.

1722
01:37:33,431 --> 01:37:36,685
You're there, you have arrived.

1723
01:37:39,562 --> 01:37:43,863
Your mind is becoming quieter
and quieter.

1724
01:37:44,859 --> 01:37:48,033
Bliss is coming over you...

1725
01:37:50,406 --> 01:37:51,783
Now.

1726
01:37:53,201 --> 01:37:54,999
Until the next time.

1727
01:37:59,165 --> 01:38:00,963
Sleep.
