18
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.200
Would this work?

19
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.900
Hey, Bai Ze, do I look like I'm of the same height as Little Hai Xing?

20
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.400
How about letting me do it instead?

21
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.200
Why do you like stealing my glory?

22
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.590
This time, there's no use no matter who does the convincing.

23
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.400
Just wait and watch me teach them a lesson.

24
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.690
We will all be hiding at the periphery.

25
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.800
Once there's danger, we'll all come over to help you.

26
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.600
I got it. I got it.

27
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.600
Little Hai Xing, you must remember these Older Brothers and Sisters.

28
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.600
- They are risking their lives to save you.
- Yes.

29
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.500
It's something that we should do.

30
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.000
There seems to be some movement.

31
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.600
Everyone just follow the plan.

32
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.200
A Ji Ya, hurry and hide.

33
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.600
Hurry and hide. Hurry and hide.

34
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.400
- Let's go.
- Come.

35
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.400
We've arrived quite early.

36
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.100
There is still 15 minutes left.

37
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.000
Gong Zi Xu Xu and the others have entered already.

38
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.200
When do we attack?

39
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.700
Just wait for a while more.

40
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.000
Mister, he's trembling.

41
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.380
It's your first time to come here.

42
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.600
When you've seen enough of them, you'll get used to it.

43
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.800
A child being chosen to go up the mountains for training,

44
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.440
it can't be helped for him to be a bit anxious and nervous.

45
00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.200
Trembling is normal.

46
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.500
Mister, he's shaking more violently.

47
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.900
Wait for me for a while!

48
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.100
I will immediately...

49
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.130
What's going on?

50
00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.200
Look.

51
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.000
Wasn't that the drunk lady from before?

52
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.400
Older Brother Bai Ze!

53
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.300
A person who can't even control one's weapon is just a useless paper tiger!

54
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.000
Attack!

55
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.840
All of you be careful!

56
00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.400
I'm coming!

57
00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.700
This...

58
00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.800
Be careful!

59
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.400
Xiong Fei!

60
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.500
They won't be able to hold up much longer.

61
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.400
No matter what, since they are enemies of the Illuminati,

62
00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.190
then they are our friends.

63
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:54.100
Let's help them.

64
00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.400
Hurry and run!

65
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.270
We've fallen into a trap! This is an ambush!

66
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:08.600
Retreat!

67
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.600
Older Bro Fei, were you the one who threw the bombs?

68
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.600
It  wasn't me.

69
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.500
It wasn't me, either.

70
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.400
Where did these people come from?

71
00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.700
Think of a way to know their identities.

72
00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.800
Right now, we must unite to resist the Illuminati's strength.

73
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.200
Okay.

74
00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.200
I'll immediately check on it.

75
00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.800
But just letting Gong Zi Xu escape like this,

76
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.000
we've missed this great chance.

77
00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:43.000
You must always remember our main goal.

78
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.300
Killing a Gong Zi Xu is easy but it is not time for that yet.

79
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.600
Good thing that this child has them to protect him.

80
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.410
We don't need to be worry too much about it.

81
00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:55.900
Let's go.

82
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.040
Older Bro Fei, are you alright?

83
00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.000
I'm fine.

84
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
But A Ji Ya,

85
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.460
how come you just watched at the sides while we were fighting so fiercely?

86
00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.100
I...

87
00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:25.490
Yuan Shuai,

88
00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.590
aren't we already okay now?

89
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.400
Just let bygones be bygones.

90
00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.330
Good thing that we are all alright.

91
00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:33.800
And A Ji Ya is a little lady.

92
00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.150
Fine. Fine.

93
00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:36.600
Just forget that I said that.

94
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.600
Xiong Fei...

95
00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:45.500
When I saw you fighting with the Dark Shadow Man before, you were quite adept in using that Gray Thunder Edge.

96
00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.600
How come earlier...

97
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.800
I also don't know.

98
00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:55.400
When I was fighting with the Dark Shadow Man last time, I felt so angry.

99
00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.390
I just wanted to defeat Dark Shadow Man.

100
00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:00.400
But today, I...

101
00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.230
Maybe it is because I'm not strong enough to

102
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:05.600
bring out the real power of the Gray Thunder Edge.

103
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.100
It's fine.

104
00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:34.500
Elder, I was useless. I wasn't able to do my mission well.

105
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.350
Do you still remember what I've taught you?

106
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:03.400
The more pressing the situation is,

107
00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.700
the more you should say it slowly.

108
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.300
Yes.

109
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.200
This is the bomb fragment that was thrown earlier from outside the walls which I picked up in our backyard.

110
00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.000
When I went out to chase them, they had gone.

111
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.600
Bomb fragments?

112
00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.200
Flash Bomb?

113
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.200
- You know this?
- What flash bomb?

114
00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.600
Isn't this the flash bomb that I usually use during my magic tricks?

115
00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.000
What is a flash bomb?

116
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
This can produce a high intensity light and sound

117
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.830
and then... it is usually used to scare people.

118
00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:35.600
It doesn't really have much damaging power.

119
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.200
<i>This is something that Illuminati disciples use during fighting practices.</i>

120
00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:45.000
<i>Could it be that those people outside are also from the Illuminati?</i>

121
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.900
<i>That can't be. How can they attack their own?</i>

122
00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:53.100
Does it mean that the one hiding under the red cloth wasn't

123
00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:57.800
the child who was supposed to be taken back here but someone else?

124
00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.400
Yes. I saw it personally.

125
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.400
That person was holding a treasure sword.

126
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.600
That sword absorbed all of the sun's energy.

127
00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.500
Right. We all saw it.

128
00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:11.920
They even have back ups.

129
00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.120
Surely, it's not only them that's around here.

130
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:17.250
Back-up?

131
00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.800
Looks like they have already made preparations beforehand.

132
00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:25.000
They were just waiting for you walk into their trap.

133
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.240
It's me who was careless.

134
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.800
Zi Xu, go down the mountain again tomorrow.

135
00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.200
Investigate the background of this group of people.

136
00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.100
The situation is still unclear right now.

137
00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:41.600
Remember, don't alarm the enemies.

138
00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.800
Yes.

139
00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:51.830
Elder.

140
00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:57.000
If what Gong Zi Xu said is true,

141
00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.600
then that sword that he saw

142
00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.800
is most likely the Gray Thunder Edge.

143
00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.700
Gray Thunder Edge?

144
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.600
Wasn't that the legendary weapon that was passed on in the family of the Heaven Strategy Envoy Zhan family?

145
00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.100
Indeed.

146
00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:18.800
The mission of a Heaven Strategy Envoy is to find the Magic Stars.

147
00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.600
Now that the Gray Thunder Edge has reappeared in Jianghu,

148
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.700
and it's even in the territory of my Illuminati.

149
00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:29.110
It's quite interesting.

150
00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.200
It's quite interesting.

151
00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.040
Then... tonight?

152
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.800
Tonight, we all will live here.

153
00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.230
Since we've already interfered with this matter, we will surely interfere until the end.

154
00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:40.900
Isn't that so, Bai Ze?

155
00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:42.500
What Xiong Fei said is correct.

156
00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.800
The Illuminati people will not just let this pass.

157
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.150
We staying here can at least give you some support.

158
00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:49.100
Yes.

159
00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:50.320
That's great.

160
00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.500
There are still two rooms here.

161
00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.600
Wife! Wife! Hurry and come here!

162
00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.300
Coming.

163
00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:58.500
Go and clean the other room and let these two ladies stay there.

164
00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.600
- I'll just go with you.
- Okay.

165
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:03.000
A Ji Ya, go with them.

166
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.800
Tonight, let me be the guard.

167
00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:06.800
Better just let me.

168
00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:10.800
No. This morning, I didn't help because I got scared.

169
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:14.800
Give me a chance to make up for it so I can feel better.

170
00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.600
Okay. Then you go.

171
00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:20.800
Remember to be careful.

172
00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:24.000
- Okay.
- Once there is any situation, immediately tell us.

173
00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:29.480
- Thank you.
- Be careful.

174
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:40.100
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Magic Stars Team @ Viki.com</i>

175
00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:49.000
Junior Apprentice,

176
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
I really envy you.

177
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.600
You can even snore so energetically.

178
00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:03.200
No wonder Teacher and Senior Apprentice really liked you, an outsider.

179
00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:07.400
In just a few days, they already allowed you to become an elder.

180
00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:13.200
Unlike me, no matter what I did, they couldn't see it.

181
00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:18.800
Just because I am old already, they wanted to let me leave.

182
00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.500
You don't understand.

183
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.360
I don't want to grow old.

184
00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.800
I can't grow old, either!

185
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.830
Do you understand?

186
00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:44.300
I forgot.

187
00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:50.800
Your brain now isn't even smarter than a five years old.

188
00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:55.800
You can't understand these words that I'm saying, either.

189
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.600
Okay then.

190
00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:05.300
Junior Apprentice, it's time to drink your medicine.

191
00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:09.370
Once you've drunk it, you can be like an idiot;

192
00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:12.110
continue living happily like this.

193
00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:14.400
So happy.

194
00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.000
Come. Come.

195
00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:44.900
<i>This time, I wronged everyone.</i>

196
00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:59.000
A Ji Ya... A Ji Ya?

197
00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.540
Wake up!

198
00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:13.200
Hurry! Wake up!

199
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.600
- Wake up!
- What's wrong?

200
00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.600
The Magic Star and Star Chart are missing.

201
00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:20.210
Star Chart? Isn't A Ji Ya outside guarding?

202
00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:22.560
But I didn't hear anything at all.

203
00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.800
A Ji Ya! A Ji Ya!

204
00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:31.800
- A Ji Ya! 
- A Ji Ya!

205
00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.200
A Ji Ya!

206
00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.100
Could she be outside?

207
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.600
- A Ji Ya! 
- A Ji Ya!

208
00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:42.000
- Weird.
- A Ji Ya!

209
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.100
- There isn't even any sign of a fight.
- That's right.

210
00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:49.100
So the truth is... A Ji Ya is a member of the Illuminati.

211
00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:52.980
She is an accomplice of the people who came here last night.

212
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.800
Zi Su, right now A Ji Ya, the Magic Star and the Star Chart are all missing.

213
00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.700
Although I don't know what the connection is between them,

214
00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.200
- we still can't make rash conclusions that she is from the Illuminati.
- That's right.

215
00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.400
I have my reasons for saying it.

216
00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.000
And look.

217
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.800
This symbol is totally the same as the one I saw on A Ji Ya when we were taking a bath.

218
00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:12.800
I don't know if you all still remember this.

219
00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:15.000
When our carriage passed by the town,

220
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.200
it was A Ji Ya who stopped the driver.

221
00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.300
<i>Mister, please stop!</i>

222
00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.400
<i>Did you take the wrong path?</i>

223
00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.980
<i>Look at me. When one gets old, one easily gets confused.</i>

224
00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:28.400
<i>If not because miss reminded me, we really would have gone past it.</i>

225
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.280
<i>Guangming Town is just one mile in front.</i>

226
00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:32.000
<i>I'll just accompany you guys up to here.</i>

227
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.700
<i>Thank you.</i>

228
00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:38.200
The most suspicious clue is that when we were fighting with the Illuminati yesterday at dusk,

229
00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.600
the A Ji Ya who usually charges to the front line didn't even help out at all.

230
00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.200
Don't you all find that suspicious?

231
00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:47.000
ZI Su, could you be overthinking about this matter?

232
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.800
Maybe it was the Illuminati who sedated A Ji Ya and stole the Magic Star.

233
00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:54.000
But what use is the Magic Star for them?

234
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
Older Bro Bai Ze, all facts and evidences are in front of us!

235
00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.400
You'd rather believe A Ji Ya than believe every word I say, is that it?

236
00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:04.600
Zi Su, it's not that I don't believe you. It's just that we still haven't found any evidence right now and already...

237
00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:07.200
Zi Su! Zi Su!

238
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.800
- Zi Su, Bai Ze didn't mean it like that.
- Don't talk to me. I don't want to hear it.

239
00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:11.300
- Is A Ji Ya that kind of person?
- Don't misunderstand him.

240
00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:13.600
- Zi Su...
- She doesn't look like one.

241
00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.770
Zi Su! Don't put it to heart.

242
00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:17.200
Bai Ze was just rash.

243
00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.600
Zi Su!

244
00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.030
Bai Ze, try to pacify her.

245
00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:25.400
When she throws tantrums, she is always like this.

246
00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.300
Hurry.

247
00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:29.200
This isn't a question of pacifying her or not.

248
00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.550
A Ji Ya is our friend.

249
00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:32.200
She is with us.

250
00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:35.800
Now that she is missing, aren't we supposed to think about her safety?

251
00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:39.200
The trust between people is hard to establish sometimes,

252
00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.000
but destroying it only needs one word.

253
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
I understand all of these that you're saying,

254
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.600
but you are a man. Isn't it just right for you to give way?

255
00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.560
This is not a question of who is the man and who isn't.

256
00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:49.200
This is a question of principles.

257
00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.920
If you can prove that A Ji Ya is a member of the Illuminati,

258
00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:53.800
by that time, I'll apologize in any way you want me to.

259
00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:57.000
- Bai Ze!
- Why are you so stubborn?

260
00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.600
Zi Su, what are you doing?

261
00:20:58.600 --> 00:20:59.930
I'll go look for the Magic Star

262
00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:01.900
and also the evidence that you wanted.

263
00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:06.260
Zhan Xiong Fei, are you coming with me or not?

264
00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.700
- Zi Su!
- Let go!

265
00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:18.200
- Yuan Shuai, you and Bai Ze stay here to protect Little Hai Xing and his family.
- Okay.

266
00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.000
Zi Su!

267
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.970
What's really happening with A Ji Ya?

268
00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:30.210
Zhan Xiong Fei, not only you can understand the Hanyu Code.

269
00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.000
Mount Guangming.

270
00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.100
I was indeed right.

271
00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:00.000
Men!

272
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.900
Right now, I will be giving a morning lecture to those children in training.

273
00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:07.730
Without my permission, no one is allowed to disturb me.

274
00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:09.800
Yes.

275
00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:52.980
What kind of people are interfering with me?

276
00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:58.660
Zi Su, where are we going?

277
00:22:58.660 --> 00:22:59.890
To the Illuminati.

278
00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:02.660
A Ji Ya took the Magic Star and Star Chart so she surely will be going there.

279
00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:04.060
By that time, you must be my witness.

280
00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:05.460
I am going to let Older Brother Bai Ze know

281
00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:08.920
that the A Ji Ya he kept siding with is that kind of person.

282
00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:13.440
What? Are you afraid?

283
00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:15.480
If you're scared, you still have time to go back.

284
00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:18.020
No. I just want to say that Mount Guangming is so far away.

285
00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:19.770
We shouldn't be just walking towards there, right?

286
00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:22.430
We should think of a faster way.

287
00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:24.900
What you said is reasonable.

288
00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:26.640
Let's go. I have an idea.

289
00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:34.830
How dare you! This is the sacred place of the Illuminati.

290
00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:36.940
How dare you come here without permission?

291
00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:39.450
I know that this is the Illuminati headquarters.

292
00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:41.600
I want to see your Elder Zhao Ran.

293
00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:43.260
Go and inform him.

294
00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:44.580
Where did you, a radical, come from?

295
00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:46.890
Is Elder Zhao Ran just someone you can see just because you ask to?

296
00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:47.930
<i>Get back!</i>

297
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:49.960
<i>I was giving you guys some respect</i>

298
00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.760
<i>and just asked you to inform him.</i>

299
00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.230
<i>If I want to enter,</i>

300
00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:56.710
how can measly guards like you even stop me?!

301
00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:57.810
You!

302
00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:00.760
I am giving you fifteen minutes to tell Elder Zhao Ran

303
00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:03.540
that the item that he has been wanting to have is in my hands.

304
00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:07.600
If he won't see me, then don't you regret it.

305
00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:10.220
Aren't you still going to hurry and go?!

306
00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.110
Owner, how are you renting this horse?

307
00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:13.840
Renting a horse?

308
00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:16.970
This money is enough to buy your horse.

309
00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:18.550
We are just going to rent it for a few days.

310
00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:19.830
Then we'll return it to you.

311
00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:21.940
This money is yours.

312
00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:24.380
Then where are you heading?

313
00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:25.880
We are going to Mount Guangming.

314
00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:27.590
What?! Mount Guangming?!

315
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:28.950
I dare not rent my horses to you.

316
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:30.300
Why?!

317
00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.060
How come you are changing your mind just like that?

318
00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:33.240
Hadn't we already agreed a while ago?

319
00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:34.190
That's right.

320
00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:37.700
Owner, could it be that your horses has problems with their legs

321
00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:39.360
that's why they won't be able to reach Mount Guangming?

322
00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:41.340
It's not a problem with the horses.

323
00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:44.780
Even if I rent my horses to you, you won't be able to reach Mount Guangming.

324
00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:47.360
The Illuminati now are very different from before.

325
00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:50.620
I fear that not only will you two be facing numerous dangers,

326
00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:54.800
what if they recognize my horses? I'll also be dragged into this trouble.

327
00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:57.130
Then isn't there any other way?

328
00:24:57.130 --> 00:24:59.230
There is one.

329
00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:02.730
In the Illuminati, there is an elder called Jiong Ye.

330
00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:05.760
- Elder Jiong Ye?
- He is very different with the other members of the Illuminati.

331
00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:07.170
He is very friendly to others.

332
00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:10.440
- Elder Jiong Ye?
- He often comes to our town leisurely strolling around alone.

333
00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:15.070
When he meets someone that he likes, he would bring them to the mountain to play with for several days

334
00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:17.100
and even brings them back.

335
00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:20.570
If you're lucky, he would even give you gifts.

336
00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:23.070
Then when does he usually come here?

337
00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.310
This I can't be sure.

338
00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:28.660
But recently, he hasn't come.

339
00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:30.760
Maybe today, he'll come.

340
00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:34.000
Oh, right. You can take a look at the bun shop in front.

341
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.370
He likes to eat the buns in there the most.

342
00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:39.380
Maybe you can meet him there.

343
00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:41.960
There really is always a way out.

344
00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:46.120
Oh, right. More importantly, you two must let him like you.

345
00:25:58.240 --> 00:25:59.600
Elder.

346
00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:04.280
Didn't I already say not to bother me?

347
00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:08.130
There is a weird man at the gates whose name we don't know.

348
00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:10.410
He said that he must see you.

349
00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:15.390
People like that who are deliberately mystifying themselves, just directly make them leave.

350
00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:18.670
But he says that he has in his hands something that you have always wanted.

351
00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:22.310
If you won't see him, he said that don't you regret it.

352
00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:25.240
Bring him to me.

353
00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:26.740
Yes.

354
00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:51.270
<i>Looks like I gambled right this time.</i>

355
00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:54.590
<i>It's been three years already. This opening still hasn't been blocked.</i>

356
00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:57.920
I brought you out here but don't tell anyone else about this opening.

357
00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:01.430
If Lord Gong Zi Xu learns about this, we're dead.

358
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:03.510
Of course, I won't tell anyone.

359
00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:05.220
Training is too hard.

360
00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:08.250
Once I go down the mountain this time, I don't even want to come back anymore.

361
00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:12.830
But if we don't come back, where else can we go?

362
00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:15.320
We all don't have parents.

363
00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:20.530
Are you from the Orphaned Child Camp?

364
00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:22.900
I beg you. We won't do it anymore.

365
00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:23.930
We'll go back right away.

366
00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:25.870
It's not his fault. It was me who brought him here.

367
00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:27.870
Let him go.

368
00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.220
Go. I'll treat it as if I didn't see anything.

369
00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:36.980
Aren't you still going to hurry and leave?! I'm going to take it back soon.

370
00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:39.050
Thank you, Older Sister! Let's go.

371
00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:04.680
This main hall is a bit narrow.

372
00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:07.710
All of you, leave.

373
00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:09.320
<i>Yes!</i>

374
00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:20.170
Did you say that you have the thing that I wanted?

375
00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:23.410
As they say, you may know a person, his face, but not his true nature.

376
00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:26.430
Right now, I can't even see elder's face.

377
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:28.870
Do you... really want to see?

378
00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:30.300
Yes.

379
00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:41.310
Elder Zhao Ran is indeed a straightforward person.

380
00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:43.480
Stop your nonsense already.

381
00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:45.480
About the events at Clouds Harbor,

382
00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.520
I already heard about it.

383
00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:49.350
A distinguished Black Dragon King

384
00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:52.060
actually ended up in such a state just due to some unskilled kids.

385
00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:54.080
Really so depressing.

386
00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:57.880
You came here not just to offer me some treasures, right?

387
00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:00.530
Elder indeed knows every minute detail.

388
00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:03.840
I want to use this treasure in exchange for

389
00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:05.880
an elder position here in Mount Guangming.

390
00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:12.130
Then it depends on what treasure you brought.

391
00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:14.240
I won't beat around the bush then.

392
00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:16.420
Right now, I have a Magic Star in my hands.

393
00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:19.390
Don't know if it's worth an elder position.

394
00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:25.000
Black Dragon King hasn't been dead for that long and you are already selling yourself to serve another master.

395
00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:29.660
Black Dragon King really trusted the wrong person.

396
00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:31.500
A good bird chooses the best tree to nest in.

397
00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:33.150
There's nothing wrong with that.

398
00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:34.270
Let's not talk about this anymore.

399
00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:36.270
Better talk about you instead.

400
00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:40.530
That recovering one's youthful vigor method of yours, looking for children whose birth date matches yours,

401
00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:42.020
there will come a time that you won't find one anymore.

402
00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:44.810
And you'll get older and older and the amount that you'll require will be greater and greater.

403
00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:46.190
What do you plan to do in the future?

404
00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:50.080
If you are able to get this Magic Star, you can then be young forever.

405
00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:53.810
I admit that what you are saying is very tempting.

406
00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:58.910
But... is the Magic Star really in your hands?

407
00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.480
Are you now agreeing with my conditions?

408
00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:20.590
Deal.

409
00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:23.870
A distinguished elder actually also swindles people.

410
00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:26.140
Aren't you looking down on me too much?!

411
00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:36.630
You clearly know in your heart that people who have seen my real face

412
00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:38.930
can never leave here alive.

413
00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:41.070
Then it would depend if you have the ability to do that.

414
00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:44.530
I initially wanted to tell you that there is another Magic Star that's also in Guangming Town

415
00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:46.350
and let's work together to get it.

416
00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:50.370
From the looks of it now, you are not an ideal partner.

417
00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:58.320
Stinky brat...

418
00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.390
Go die!

419
00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:30.590
Respectfully greeting, Elder.

420
00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:36.600
I like people who shoot hidden arrows.

421
00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:39.020
That's right.

422
00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:44.600
The other Magic Star won't be able to escape my palms.

423
00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:49.630
Those little rascals that you were talking about include descendants of Heaven Strategy Envoys.

424
00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:51.980
A monster like you

425
00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:55.230
won't have a good ending.

426
00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:06.500
Looks like, we have a new enemy.

427
00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:12.080
Could it be that we only have this method left?

428
00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:14.070
Having one method is not bad already.

429
00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:17.070
It's way better than when we were just randomly going about things earlier.

430
00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:18.880
I am not optimistic as you.

431
00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:20.690
Didn't you hear what the owner said earlier?

432
00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:24.160
Only by making him like us can he be willing to bring us up the mountain.

433
00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:29.430
That's so easy. As long as I get to see him, I will surely beguile him and make him like me.

434
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:32.810
You are not some money or treasure so why would he like you?

435
00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:35.820
Based on my individual charm.

436
00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:38.330
Zhan Xiong Fei, you are the most vane person I've seen.

437
00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:40.000
How about this? I'll just go look for some props.

438
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.580
Later, it will be of great use.

439
00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:43.530
- Let's go.
- Okay.

440
00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:05.300
<i>It's been three years already.</i>

441
00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:09.000
<i>It's still looks the same. No change at all.</i>

442
00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:16.960
<i>How come the star chart isn't reacting at all?</i>

443
00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:21.170
Who's there?!

444
00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:29.580
I was too naughty and planned to go down the mountain without permission.

445
00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:30.970
Senior Apprentice, please have mercy.

446
00:33:30.970 --> 00:33:33.850
I... I won't do it anymore.

447
00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:37.630
Are you a disciple of our Illuminati?

448
00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:39.950
How come I've never seen you before?

449
00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:42.370
I only do chores under Gong Zi Xu.

450
00:33:42.370 --> 00:33:44.330
It's normal that you haven't seen me.

451
00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:48.410
Oh, since you are a disciple under Lord Gong Zi Xu,

452
00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:51.930
then you must be very familiar with the rules of Illuminati.

453
00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:53.950
The crime of going down the mountain without permission...

454
00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:58.520
Senior Apprentice, so sorry.

455
00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:00.380
I just got a bit too playful.

456
00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:03.520
Just let me go and I will surely repay you.

457
00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:06.240
Come. Come.

458
00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:09.050
Get up. Get up.

459
00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:12.850
You really followed the right person.

460
00:34:12.850 --> 00:34:17.030
Lord Gong Zi Xu is an well-known future star of our Illuminati.

461
00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:18.760
No need for you to repay me.

462
00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:20.680
From now on, let's just take care of each other more.

463
00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:24.560
Maybe in the future, we will be able to help each other regarding some matter.

464
00:34:26.850 --> 00:34:30.730
Then... can I go now?

465
00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:32.670
Go.

466
00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:34.010
<i>That was really scoring a lucky hit.</i>

467
00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:37.210
<i>Unexpectedly, after being away for three years, Gong Zi Xu Xu's name is still this useful.</i>

468
00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:38.940
Wait!

469
00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:42.610
Senior Apprentice, do you still need anything?

470
00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:45.200
I still don't know what your name is.

471
00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:48.960
My name is Jiang Ran. I am the guard of the Three Sacred Palaces.

472
00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:51.160
Look at my memory.

473
00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:53.640
My name is A Ji Ya. I work under Lord Gong Zi Xu.

474
00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:55.860
When you go to Lord Gong ZI Xu's area, you'll find me.

475
00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:57.540
I'll go now.

476
00:34:58.210 --> 00:35:00.160
Wait again!

477
00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:04.550
Last night, Lord Gong Zi Xu went down the mountain

478
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:06.130
to do some tasks for Elder Zhao Ran.

479
00:35:06.130 --> 00:35:07.570
You surely know about it, right?

480
00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:10.100
<i>Looks like you aren't as stupid as I thought you were.</i>

481
00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:12.520
<i>Wanting to test me? Just say it directly.</i>

482
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:14.980
Of course, I know.

483
00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:18.950
And also, I know that Lord Gong Zi Xu encountered a little bit of problem.

484
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:20.760
I know more than that.

485
00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.080
But these are all secrets.

486
00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:24.990
Forgive me for not being able to tell you about them.

487
00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:28.530
It's fine. With something like that happening yesterday,

488
00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:31.340
I was only just increasing my vigilance. There's nothing wrong with that.

489
00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:33.700
What Senior Apprentice said is right.

490
00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:34.640
I'll go now.

491
00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:36.880
Wait again.

492
00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:38.720
I have one last question.

493
00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:42.920
What are the eight words internal incantation of the Illuminati?

494
00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:46.420
Spread the brightness and the justice all over the whole world.

495
00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:49.660
Not one word is wrong.

496
00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:51.080
Be at ease and go back.

497
00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:53.270
What happened today is just our secret.

498
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:55.440
No one will know.

499
00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:57.280
Thank you, Senior Apprentice.

500
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.440
Senior Apprentice, did I say something wrong?

501
00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:16.320
Why are you suddenly attacking me?

502
00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:17.510
Who is your Senior Apprentice?!

503
00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:19.130
Don't think that because I have one blind eye,

504
00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:21.160
but my heart is not blind at all.

505
00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:24.570
Even if you are going to kill me, you should still tell me why, right?

506
00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:26.600
Okay. I'll tell you then.

507
00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:29.310
You made a mistake on the simplest question.

508
00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:33.660
The eight words internal incantation of Illuminati is "As bright as the sun and moon, only the Illuminati should be revered."

509
00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:36.320
What you said was already the old one.

510
00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:39.600
When I came here two years ago, it had already been changed.

511
00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:42.630
That is the eight words internal incantation passed on for thousands of years by our ancestral court.

512
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:44.150
How can it be changed just like that?

513
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:45.890
What ancestral court?

514
00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:47.530
I only know that right now,

515
00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:51.210
only the words of Elder Zhao Ran and Lord Gong Zi Xu matter here in the Illuminati.

516
00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:55.000
You caused me to waste my time on you for such a long time. I should have just directly used force.

517
00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.790
Wow? Such arrogant words.

518
00:36:57.790 --> 00:36:59.050
With just that skill of yours,

519
00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:01.180
if you leave now, I can let you live.

520
00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:02.330
Stop your rubbish!

521
00:37:02.330 --> 00:37:03.800
Look at my sword!

522
00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:53.860
Let's see now whose life will be lost.

523
00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:56.520
Guard, we came late.

524
00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:59.390
Not late. Not late. Just right.

525
00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:04.630
So you were just dragging all this time, weren't you?

526
00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:08.830
That's right. I already told you before that even if my eye is blind, my heart isn't.

527
00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:10.240
Come!

528
00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:13.100
Arrest this person imposing as Lord Gong Zi Xu's disciple

529
00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:14.940
and bring her to him!

530
00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:16.600
Yes!

531
00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:18.760
Go! Move!

532
00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:20.730
Let go of me!

533
00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:22.820
I checked on the Mountain Creek Inn earlier.

534
00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:25.440
That is where they stayed upon arriving here at Guangming Town.

535
00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:29.770
The owner said that when they arrived, there were five of them, three boys and two girls.

536
00:38:29.770 --> 00:38:32.540
After leaving last night, they haven't returned anymore.

537
00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:37.260
From their stories, he learned that they came from Clouds Harbor.

538
00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:41.170
But one man and one woman among them speaks with intonations coming from the capital.

539
00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:42.290
Five people?

540
00:38:42.290 --> 00:38:44.910
But we only saw four people yesterday.

541
00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:46.710
There was one woman missing.

542
00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:48.830
Since they are not from here,

543
00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:51.170
how could they have any grudges with the Illuminati?

544
00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:55.070
Maybe the problem lies on that woman we haven't seen.

545
00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:58.590
I suspect that she might be someone we know.

546
00:38:58.590 --> 00:39:00.290
A person we know?

547
00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:01.950
Stop beating around the bush already.

548
00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:03.400
Just hurry and say what you think.

549
00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.000
Let's analyze it together.

550
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.180
I suspect that the girl that we didn't see

551
00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:10.260
is A Ji Ya.

552
00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:12.380
A Ji Ya?

553
00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:15.740
You're talking about that A Ji Ya who left Illuminati without permission three years ago?

554
00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:16.920
Yes.

555
00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:20.080
But that was only my suspicion. I am not sure of it yet.

556
00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:24.350
If it was really the missing A Ji Ya appearing now in Guangming Town,

557
00:39:24.350 --> 00:39:26.630
this matter can't be that simple anymore.

558
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:30.440
But I remember that Gong Zi Xu and A Ji Ya's relationship before was very good.

559
00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:34.180
Yesterday, could she have deliberately hid herself?

560
00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:38.390
Then what is the motive of this group of people for doing that?

561
00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:40.200
As for now, just base on these bits and pieces of clues we know,

562
00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:42.920
we still won't be able to determine what the real situation is.

563
00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:44.570
You guys continue investigating.

564
00:39:44.570 --> 00:39:46.550
Remember. There surely is a reason for everything.

565
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:49.100
But there is only one truth.

566
00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:50.150
Yes.

567
00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:51.460
Right now, the atmosphere is a bit tense.

568
00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:52.940
Shouldn't we stop the underground gathering

569
00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:54.830
that we do for a while?

570
00:39:54.830 --> 00:39:56.380
Let's evade this dangerous time for now.

571
00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:57.700
We can't.

572
00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:00.750
It wasn't easy for us to get the trust of those people who are bearing grudges against the Illuminati.

573
00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:04.890
If we retreat now, then the tree will fall and the monkeys will scatter.

574
00:40:04.890 --> 00:40:06.670
Continue everything as usual.

575
00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:08.350
- Yes.
- Yes.

576
00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.440
What's wrong with you?

577
00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:15.620
You were still okay earlier.

578
00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:19.650
Don't know why.

579
00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:23.880
But since last time we met that old man who did magic tricks,

580
00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:26.680
I suddenly remembered my father.

581
00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:29.320
Since I was little, my father already taught me to do magic tricks.

582
00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:34.270
He said that once I've learned this skill, I won't starve wherever I go.

583
00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:38.930
But that time, I was too playful and didn't learn from frin him well.

584
00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:41.800
When I already wanted to learn,

585
00:40:43.610 --> 00:40:45.510
my father was already gone.

586
00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:50.530
For so many years,

587
00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:53.130
my impression of Father is becoming more and more blurred.

588
00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:59.600
I already can't remember what he looks like.

589
00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:04.130
Zi Su, am I not filial?

590
00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:06.400
Don't think that way.

591
00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:10.920
What you are doing now is exactly rebuilding the glory of your father.

592
00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:13.440
What you said is correct.

593
00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:16.260
Right now, we still have to do our present task well.

594
00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:17.720
Make this Elder Jiong Ye submit to us with one move.

595
00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:21.950
I have a feeling that we will be able to win him over.

596
00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:23.490
Let's go.

597
00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:27.540
- Let's go.
- Come. Let's go.

598
00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:31.410
Older Brother Yuan Shuai. Older Brother Yuan Shuai, let's play outside.

599
00:41:31.410 --> 00:41:33.010
We can't, Little Hai Xing.

600
00:41:33.010 --> 00:41:34.470
It's very dangerous right now outside.

601
00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:36.000
Let's just play inside the house, okay?

602
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.740
No. What's good to play inside the house?

603
00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:43.260
I can make you a very powerful frog.

604
00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:45.910
He can jump like this.

605
00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:48.060
Okay! Okay!

606
00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:49.480
Go and get some paper and I'll teach you how to make one.

607
00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:50.760
Okay.

608
00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:01.820
Let me tell you.  This frog, it can...

609
00:42:04.890 --> 00:42:09.560
Bai Ze! Bai Ze!

610
00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:11.820
Look. What is written here?

611
00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:13.990
The current Illuminati has changed.

612
00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:17.600
The so-called training for the young child is also just a hoax.

613
00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:20.570
If we still don't unite and resist them, there will come a day

614
00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:22.750
that we will become the next sacrificial victim.

615
00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:26.440
From the real Illuminati.

616
00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:27.930
The real Illuminati?

617
00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:30.760
Is the Illuminati now a fake?

618
00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:33.840
Where did you get this?

619
00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:35.290
It's from my father.

620
00:42:35.290 --> 00:42:37.060
Your father's?

621
00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:56.460
- Let go of me!
- Hurry up!

622
00:42:58.070 --> 00:43:00.240
Hurry up! Hurry!

623
00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:04.210
Behave!

624
00:43:04.210 --> 00:43:05.860
Let go of me!

625
00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:09.350
Behave!

626
00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:15.670
Oh, Elder Jiong Ye. I'm giving you my respect.

627
00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:18.570
Jeez, no need, no need.

628
00:43:18.570 --> 00:43:20.260
<i>Elder?</i>

629
00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:22.010
<i>Elder Jiong Ye?</i>

630
00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:24.030
There really is always a way out.

631
00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:26.090
Where are you going now?

632
00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:27.880
Down the mountain to eat some buns.

633
00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:30.060
If you want to eat some buns, you could have just told us to get them for you.

634
00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:31.240
No need for you to personally go down the mountain.

635
00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:36.400
What do you know? When you eat buns, you have to eat them while they're hot. So delicious.

636
00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:40.160
Elder! It's me! I am A Ji Ya!

637
00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:41.670
A Ji Ya?

638
00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:43.530
It's me.

00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:22.450
<i>♫ How long can my friends around me to accompany me? ♫</i>

640
00:44:22.450 --> 00:44:28.690
<i>♫ I’m tired of hearing those comforting words ♫</i>

641
00:44:28.690 --> 00:44:34.320
<i>♫ I’m pulled between courage and collapse repeatedly ♫</i>

642
00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:41.560
<i>♫ I cry out to myself to hang in there ♫</i>

643
00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:48.380
<i>♫ I’m still awake at 3 in the early morning ♫</i>

644
00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:55.330
<i>♫ I can only expect for a good night sleep but not having it ♫</i>

645
00:44:55.330 --> 00:45:01.100
<i>♫ If I’m not careful, I’ll be disturbed once I think about you ♫</i>

646
00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:11.030
<i>♫ Memory has been overturned into a kind of sin ♫</i>

647
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:14.700
<i>♫ Having loved one very much is wrong but so what ♫</i>

648
00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:18.130
<i>♫ Loneliness is also just a process ♫</i>

649
00:45:18.130 --> 00:45:24.770
<i>♫ We still have next person waiting for us ♫</i>

650
00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:28.400
<i>♫ I’ll remember those wonderful things ♫</i>

651
00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:31.150
<i>♫ Shedding tears isn’t need ♫</i>

652
00:45:31.150 --> 00:45:33.080
<i>♫ Thank you for your choosing ♫</i>

653
00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:34.830
<i>♫ Don’t force myself to give blessing ♫</i>

654
00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:42.120
<i>♫ Be a mature person ♫</i>

655
00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:51.870
<i>♫ Having loved one very much is worth the pain and so happy ♫</i>

656
00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:58.280
<i>♫ I need to learn to let go those I can’t part with ♫</i>

657
00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:02.020
<i>♫ Having loved one very much is wrong but so what ♫</i>

658
00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:05.400
<i>♫ Loneliness is also just a process ♫</i>

659
00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:11.910
<i>♫ We still have next person waiting for us ♫</i>

660
00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:19.890
<i>♫ With a little regret, I’m more complete ♫</i>
