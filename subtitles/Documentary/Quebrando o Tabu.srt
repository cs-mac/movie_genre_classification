1
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:16,216
presents

2
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:24,624
in co-producntion with

3
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,603
a film by

4
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:45,945
TABU

5
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:53,620
<i>Under the rain and scorching sun,</i>

6
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:56,156
<i>a melancholic creature</i>

7
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:59,926
<i>treks through jungles
and arid lands for months.</i>

8
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,463
<i>In the heart of the black contlnent,</i>

9
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:08,101
<i>neither beasts nor cannibals
seem to frighten
then intrepid explorer.</i>

10
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:15,642
<i>Followed by a contingent of men
carrying beads fabrics</i>

11
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:19,746
<i>and modern
scientlfic exmpedition tools.</i>

12
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:24,284
<i>The group includes in its ranks
His Majesty the King of Portugal,</i>

13
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:28,121
<i>or at least his will,
as expressed in a royal decree,</i>

14
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:33,259
<i>and He who is above
who all creatures call Creator,</i>

15
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:36,696
<i>and whose voice lives in the Bible.</i>

16
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:46,206
<i>But even if his legs move forward
by superior will</i>

17
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:47,807
<i>sovereign or divine</i>

18
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:52,946
<i>the heart, the most insolent
muscle of all anatomy,</i>

19
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:56,382
<i>dictates other reasons for the march.</i>

20
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:00,487
<i>Poor miserable man!</i>

21
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:05,425
<i>This whimsical organ
rules over both King and the Eternal.</i>

22
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:08,661
<i>So we here by reveal
the true law of this expedition</i>

23
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:13,133
<i>to roam the ends of the world</i>

24
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:16,000
<i>walking away from the land where he saw</i>

25
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:20,640
<i>his beloved wife perish,
as if he could ever stop death.</i>

26
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,412
<i>Intrepid he is,
but out of desperation.</i>

27
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,082
<i>Taciturn and melancholic,</i>

28
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:32,685
<i>the sad flgure wannders desolately
over thne inhospitable planes.</i>

29
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,957
<i>And by mysteries unknown,</i>

30
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:43,863
<i>he is visited from afar by the one
whom his heart begs for,</i>

31
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:48,301
<i>wearing
- oh morbid detail! -</i>

32
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:52,605
<i>the dress that hugged her
when she returned to dust.</i>

33
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:02,282
You may run as far as you can,
for as long as you like,

34
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:05,185
but you will not escape your heart.

35
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:09,422
Then I will die.

36
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:13,960
You sad and poor soul.

37
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:53,967
<i>A crocodile awaits its moment,
submerged in murky waters.</i>

38
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,337
<i>The intrepid explorer is well aware</i>

39
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:00,506
<i>he will meet his destiny in this river.</i>

40
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:06,546
<i>His men witness the horror.
The explorer bids farewell to life.</i>

41
00:04:57,163 --> 00:05:01,934
<i>Night falls in the savannah,
as will a thousand and one more.</i>

42
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:06,039
Then and ever since,

43
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:10,176
<i>despite how absurd this may sound
to men of reason</i>

44
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:15,381
<i>some swear to have witnessed
this ghoulish sight:</i>

45
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:19,986
<i>a sad and melancholic crocodile</i>

46
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,523
<i>with a lady from days gone by,</i>

47
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:26,926
<i>an inseparable pair
united by a mysterious pact</i>

48
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:29,662
<i>never broken by death.</i>

49
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:48,014
PART ONE.
A LOST PARADISE

50
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,888
28 December

51
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:42,395
Let's go, Maya!

52
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:12,625
Hello.

53
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,361
Hi, Miss Aurora.

54
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:18,798
Yes.

55
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:23,636
All right.

56
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,506
OK.

57
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:43,022
Yes, Santa?

58
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,324
Miss Aurora called from the casino.

59
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,761
She has lost everything.
She has no money for the train.

60
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:10,850
Remember our conversation
a few months ago?

61
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:14,020
You told me
you wouldn't come back here.

62
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:17,890
My dear Pilar,
this time was different to the others.

63
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:20,660
Do you have any money left, Aurora?

64
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,563
No, dear. All gone.

65
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:25,932
So it was the same.

66
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,299
No, Pilar. It was different.
It was from a dream.

67
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,609
From a dream?

68
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:42,782
There were monkeys
with very hairy arms.

69
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:46,586
They were all fighting. Losts of them.

70
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:49,922
In the kitchen,
the living room, the bedroom...

71
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:52,124
All biting each other.

72
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,294
I even told them
to get out and be friends.

73
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:58,764
But all they wanted to do was bite.
What at nightmare!

74
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:03,235
I had to phone my daughter
to ask her to get me a lawyer.

75
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:06,230
And then I was somewhere else!

76
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:09,541
At the house of a friend

77
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,677
who died over ten years ago,
poor thing.

78
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:16,048
We were eating toast
with pumpkin jam delicious.

79
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:19,785
And one monkey could speak,

80
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,090
but sometimes
the monkey was her husband.

81
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:30,529
Thinking back,
her husband was a really hairy man.

82
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:33,165
When he pulled his sleeves up

83
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:35,401
you could see lots of hair.

84
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:40,506
Sometimes he was a monkey,
sometimes the husband.

85
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:44,210
I had to phone my daughter,
in case she came to visit

86
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,379
and saw only the biting monkeys.

87
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:49,815
To stop her from thinking
they had eaten me.

88
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:57,957
Then again... my daughter hardly
ever visits me anyway.

89
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:00,960
She can't, poor thing.

90
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,363
Especially now she's in Canada.

91
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:14,740
But you know what dreams are like.
We can't command them...

92
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,576
So the husband, or the monkey...

93
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:21,647
said he had made a fortune
on the machines at the casino,

94
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,984
in the old casino,
since the new one in rubbish.

95
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,787
The wife replied,

96
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:31,090
"Lucky at gambling, unlucky in love. "

97
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:35,327
And I thought she said that

98
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:38,197
because she was cheating on him.

99
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:41,100
She was dead,

100
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,803
so she was cheating on him
with the dead.

101
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:48,307
Even with some foreign celebrities.

102
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:54,380
The husband heard this
and was very sad.

103
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:58,651
I took the train with him
because I felt sorry for him.

104
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:02,720
I told him there were
other dedicated and honest women.

105
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:05,357
Like Our Lady.

106
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:10,960
When the ticket inspector came,
the husband pretended to be a monkey

107
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:15,167
and hung from the things
that people hold on to.

108
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:20,840
I had no ticket
so the inspector took me to get one,

109
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:26,011
but the ticket machine
was a casino betting machine.

110
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,616
I felt anxious in front of it,

111
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:34,169
the collector would say a colour,

112
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,522
I would bet the opposite
and always win.

113
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,626
Until I thought
maybe he was telling the truth.

114
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:42,628
And I had to decide

115
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:47,800
if I bet what he said,
or the opposite, or take the money.

116
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,105
I woke up before the end

117
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:59,445
and decided I had to come here
to see if I was lucky

118
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:06,285
I am such a fool:
people's lives are not like dreams.

119
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,691
But if I hadn't come
I'd still he wondering...

120
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:25,538
Are you mad at me, Santa?

121
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:34,213
What a dismal day.

122
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:37,983
The forecast was rain.

123
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:32,438
Nonsense...

124
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:42,615
I won't eat all these prawns, Santa.

125
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:47,219
I'll be alone for dinner, after all.
The Polish girl isn't coming.

126
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,122
They're for you and Miss Aurora.

127
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:52,258
We've already had dinner.

128
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,426
They'll go to waste.

129
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,929
I've kept lots.

130
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:01,467
Thank you, Miss Pilar.

131
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,934
How I decided to travel the world:

132
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:15,374
I was born in York in 1632...

133
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,377
...to a good family.

134
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:26,251
After becoming a rich man,
my father retired from business

135
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:29,221
and settled down in this town.

136
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:31,757
He had married my mother...

137
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:35,527
It is thought...

138
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:38,397
...to be a hideout...

139
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:40,866
...of the Moors...

140
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:45,437
...of the Moors and Romans.

141
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:51,243
This here was a passage

142
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:54,880
to the castle of Torres Novas.

143
00:16:55,981 --> 00:17:02,321
All I'm telling you
is not reality but tales.

144
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:05,758
Incidentally, there is no proof.

145
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:09,595
But if remains were found,
it could be true.

146
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,864
This way.

147
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,500
29 December

148
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:19,972
Someone asked if there are bats. Sure!

149
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:25,778
We can't see them
but we can check if they're here now.

150
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,081
For 23 years,

151
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:35,054
I performed my duty
respectfully and with care.

152
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,826
I buried 280 corpses.

153
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:48,400
Any others around,
and I'm ready to do my job.

154
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:52,538
Man, do you talk nothing but nonsense?

155
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,242
The World War II invasions

156
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:01,246
only strengthened
centuries-old Catholicism.

157
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:05,317
Centuries old?
Millennia, Pilar, millennia!

158
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:09,721
Rather more apostolic than Roman,
if you follow...

159
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,623
Not really.

160
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:19,098
Look, my dear,
losing your guest isn't that bad.

161
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:21,200
Damn Taizés!

162
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:26,405
All happily stuffing themselves
with "nata" cakes and smoking joints

163
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:29,641
after singing the psalms!
- How silly

164
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,614
Even the toughest Pole
would soften

165
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:40,853
at my dearest friend
Pilar's hospitality.

166
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:46,959
As for the carrot cake,
it won't go to waste.

167
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:50,295
"A slice is kept
for the one who will eat it".

168
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:56,435
I must admit,
all this climbing has made me hungry.

169
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:00,506
Not today,
I have to finish, my report

170
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,407
for the Peace and Justice committee.

171
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:06,612
I can't focus, I'm too worried
about my neighbour's crisis.

172
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,014
You worry about everything.

173
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:14,019
Sometimes I regret that
I haven't stepped on an African mine...

174
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:18,050
just to get your attention.
- You didn't even go to war.

175
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:23,090
Varices...
We've lost a soldier and won an artist.

176
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:24,363
I'm glad.

177
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:30,435
And your neighbour?

178
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:33,772
It makes me sorry
to see her all alone.

179
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,675
She must be having a breakdown.

180
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,777
She saw so little of her daughter
at Christmas.

181
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:43,081
She was in Portugal for 3 or 4 days
and had only minutes for her mother.

182
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:47,619
Left her a gift
and went to meet her husband's family.

183
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:49,922
Do you find that acceptable?

184
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,961
You want to see me dead!

185
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:58,730
Ungrateful! You wish for my death!

186
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,401
I'll kill myself right away!
- Come home, madam.

187
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:05,904
Give me my pills, black woman!

188
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:08,707
None left. If you want pills,
get them from your daughter.

189
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,409
How dare you?

190
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:14,413
You turned my daughter against me
with your witchcraft!

191
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:18,250
Pilar! Open up, Pilar!

192
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,721
You are my only friend.

193
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,226
Nobody cares about me...

194
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:57,022
<i>"For Pilar"</i>

195
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:16,875
<i>"My dear friend,
my maid locks me in my bedroom.</i>

196
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:19,678
<i>I'm sure my daughter doesn't know,</i>

197
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:22,014
<i>or she would fire her
and take me to the doctor's</i>

198
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:24,783
<i>so I can get the sleeping pills I need.</i>

199
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:28,487
<i>I fear my daughter
has been irremediably poisoned</i>

200
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,157
<i>by this devil worshipper's
lies and witchcrafts.</i>

201
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:37,362
<i>Because she never listens to me
and thinks I am mad.</i>

202
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:40,966
<i>Pilar, I need to see you urgently.</i>

203
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,201
<i>You're the only one I can trust.</i>

204
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,405
<i>Yours. Aurora"</i>

205
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:01,119
Pilarita, we're very concerned.

206
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,488
You must be very sad,

207
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,357
missing the little Polish
nun's company.

208
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:07,526
We came to pay you a visit.

209
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:16,835
Delicious cake!

210
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:20,339
It's the only one I can make.
- Really good.

211
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,342
Oh, a new painting!

212
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:26,411
It's modern... and weird.

213
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,651
It was a gift from my painter friend.

214
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:35,520
He's a good man
but this is not this best.

215
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:38,420
I thought me might come today,

216
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:41,760
didn't want to disappoint him
if it wasn't on the wall.

217
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,162
But as he's not coming...

218
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:53,638
Santa, give me another slice.
This will be my dinner.

219
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:58,243
Have some more, too,
you won't have to worry later.

220
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:00,278
I'm fine, thank you.

221
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:09,287
I'll do that later, Santa.

222
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:10,956
I like doing it.

223
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:16,728
Don't you think Ms Aurora has been
more nervous lately?

224
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:20,465
She complains she can't slepp...
- She wakes up early.

225
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:26,805
Ms Aurora is special, has a tendency
to exgerate a lot of imagination.

226
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:28,607
That's true.

227
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:32,944
...but I think she's not well.
We should do something.

228
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,447
Madam, I do as I am told.

229
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:40,702
I think she's having a breakdown.

230
00:23:40,703 --> 00:23:43,555
She needs medication,
not a "crazy" tag.

231
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:45,624
Her daughter is the boss.

232
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:49,995
But her daughter doesn't care!
Don't you see that, Santa?

233
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:54,266
Excuse me, madam.

234
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,220
I've had a wonderful idea:

235
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:27,299
You will make another cake
for Santa's birthday.

236
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:29,768
Have you told Pilar, Santa?

237
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:32,170
She's having a party at mine,

238
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:34,306
and even have a few cousins round.

239
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:37,042
That's much better.

240
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:42,447
Sometimes people give us presents
that don't suit us at all.

241
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:45,984
They mean well
but they don't know our taste.

242
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:52,620
See this? A present from my daughter.

243
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:56,161
It's very soft
and suits me really well.

244
00:24:57,529 --> 00:25:03,368
It has this beluga print,
those whales she studies in Canada.

245
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:07,706
That way she knows
I won't forget her.

246
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:19,484
"PETITION FOR THE APPALLED ECONOMISTS"

247
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:24,422
"CAMPAIGN.
HUMAN RIGHTS = LESS POVERTY"

248
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:28,026
"ARMS TRAFFICKING, RISE IN DEATHS"

249
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:41,106
Our Father in heaven,
hallowed be your name,

250
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,742
your kingdom come,
your will be done

251
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:47,812
on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread,

252
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:52,017
and forgive us the wrong we have done
as we forgive those who wrong us.

253
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:55,053
Lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from the devil...

254
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:56,655
Amen.

255
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,764
Lord, please watch over Ms Aurora
who has been so restless.

256
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:08,767
Give her some peace.

257
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:27,252
30 December

258
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:34,259
Santa made no mistakes
in this dictation.

259
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:38,563
She has made enormous progress,
an example to us all.

260
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:43,969
I think I know why that is.

261
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:49,641
Santa told me
she has been reading a book.

262
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:52,744
Isn't that right, Santa?
- Yes.

263
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:55,013
Which book?

264
00:26:57,048 --> 00:26:58,984
Robinson Crusoe.

265
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:01,453
Extraordinary!

266
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:05,890
What's the book about?

267
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:13,665
This is too much work, Santa.
It'll be the last time.

268
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:17,769
An old lady like me doesn't need this.

269
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:20,338
That's life, Ms Aurora.

270
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:24,809
Have you got any money for me, Santa?

271
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:29,147
No, you spent it all at the casino.
You'll have to ask your daughter.

272
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,532
I'm going out. I won't be long.

273
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:51,403
You're not pawning that coat, are you?
- What a nerve!

274
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,705
Your daughter will be angry

275
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:56,508
if you come back
without the coat like last time.

276
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:58,743
Monster!

277
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,447
I am the prisoner of a monster!

278
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:18,563
How is Ms Aurora?
- She's lying down.

279
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:22,367
Santa, this can't go on.
We'll have to call her daughter.

280
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:24,302
I need her number.

281
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:28,339
I'm not allowed to give out her number.
You'll have to ask Ms Aurora.

282
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:30,809
Is this the way to treat someone?

283
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:33,445
Can't you see your nistress needs help?

284
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:37,449
Why do you have to mind
other people's business?

285
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:39,784
Who is it, Santa?

286
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:41,286
It's Ms Pilar.

287
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,688
Leave, Santa.

288
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:54,165
My friens, I'm so glad you're here.
You won't believe what's happening.

289
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,935
They want to see me dead.
- Calm down, Ms Aurora.

290
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:59,838
I can't. You don't know a thing.

291
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:03,641
I do but nobody else does.
I don't want to go to hell.

292
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:09,140
Pilar,
I beg you to pray to Saint Anthony!

293
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:12,784
You're so kind, like no other.

294
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:14,919
He will listen to you.

295
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:18,156
I pray, but he doesn't listen to me.

296
00:29:19,724 --> 00:29:21,926
And I know why.
- Ms Aurora...

297
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:25,497
You're too good to imagine
other people's crimes.

298
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:28,330
Horrors I am ashamed to confess.

299
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,136
I know I'm paying for them.

300
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:35,340
This black woman was sent by...

301
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:38,676
because I'm his prisoner.

302
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:42,080
Santa practices witchcraft
against all of us.

303
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,917
Against you too, Pilar,
because he's terrible.

304
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:49,020
But he has nothing against you.

305
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:53,158
Only against me.
Because I have blood on my hands.

306
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:56,460
My daughter is also under his spell.

307
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:59,790
I can smell the fumes in the night

308
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:02,400
but I'm unable to get up.

309
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:05,436
I am so afraid.

310
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:10,375
Pray to St Anthony, Pilar,

311
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,077
for me and for my daughter.

312
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:16,548
All is in your hands.

313
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:23,321
This isn't a matter of faith.

314
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:27,091
Modern science admits the possibility
of this kind of mass phenomenon.

315
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:30,061
A group of people
thinking the same thing,

316
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:32,197
together,
at the same time

317
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:34,265
can alter a situation.

318
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:38,336
It's parapsychological...
Nothing supernatural.

319
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:43,041
Assuming somebody will be there.
Lots of people are away for New Year.

320
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:48,046
Yeah, they only care
about the fireworks.

321
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:50,014
Could I have the green pen, please?

322
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:52,183
Green pen, Pilar.

323
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:57,655
Geographic dispersion is the future.
Small gatherings around the globe

324
00:30:57,822 --> 00:31:00,291
at the same time.
It's the law of simultaneity.

325
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:06,664
Pilar, you gave me the yellow pen.
I need the green one.

326
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:08,499
Silly me.

327
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,804
My head is in the clouds.

328
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:15,840
Problems can't be solved in the clouds.

329
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:25,617
"SHAME ON THE UN"

330
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:32,924
We will now proceed...

331
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:37,862
Please lower your posters
for our minute of silence.

332
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:44,636
We ask you to light the candle
you were given

333
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:49,440
and raise it, when you
manage to light it, really high...

334
00:31:58,449 --> 00:32:00,652
Pray to Saint Anthony, Pilar.

335
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:09,294
If then you ask for miracles
Death, error, all calamities,

336
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:13,464
Leprosy and demons fly,
And health succeeds infirmities.

337
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:18,836
The sea obeys and fetters break,
And lifeless limbs you do restore;

338
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:23,374
While treasures lost are found again,
When young and old your aid implore.

339
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:27,645
All dangers vanish at your prayer,
And direst need does quickly flee;

340
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:32,250
Let those who know your power proclaim,
Let Paduans say: there are yours.

341
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:36,421
To Father, Son may glory be
And Holy Ghost eternally.

342
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:39,891
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be your name.

343
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:44,329
Your kingdom come, your will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

344
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,932
31 December

345
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:51,863
Hello, Santa.
- Hello, Ms Pilar.

346
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:55,700
Well, happy birthday.
- Thank you, Ms Pilar.

347
00:33:58,236 --> 00:33:59,604
I made carrot cake.

348
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:03,007
Very good.

349
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:27,665
Shit.
- What is it?

350
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,536
That's the Portugues lady
I should have stayed with.

351
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:29,013
Did you enjoy that?
- Very much.

352
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,249
There'll be more next year.

353
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:34,652
Have you got your twelve raisins ready?
- I don't like raisins.

354
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:38,322
Pagan rituals.
Jesus, Marie, Joseph.

355
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,092
Happy New Year.

356
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,227
Happy 2011, Pilar.

357
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:49,300
You know, I've been thinking of you.

358
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:56,507
Your company, Pilar,
is the ray of light that pierces

359
00:37:56,707 --> 00:38:00,278
the darkness of the hole where lives...

360
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:02,480
blind...

361
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,449
this devoted friend of yours.

362
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:09,020
Will this beast deserve

363
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:11,455
such a delicate golden thread?

364
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:16,260
No,

365
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,729
don't answer.

366
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,334
Doies the painting
look good on the wall?

367
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:24,769
Very good.

368
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:52,063
Another one? - Take it.
I painted it thinking of you.

369
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,999
You shouldn't.

370
00:38:55,366 --> 00:39:00,638
Scribbles. The hand is rough
but soul is sensitive.

371
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:20,825
1 January

372
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:38,676
My God, please forgive me
for being such a fool sometimes.

373
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:47,318
I beg you to look after
santa and Aurora's health.

374
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:16,981
Madam is not feeling well.

375
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:32,163
Oh, Pilar, you're here?

376
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,398
Would you like some tea?

377
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:37,768
Santa,
see if we have some biscuits left.

378
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:40,171
Don't worry, Ms Aurora, I'm fine.

379
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:43,808
Oh, my friend!
I should get up, but I'm so tired.

380
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:46,644
Africa is very pretty,

381
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:51,015
but this time of year
the heat really gets to you.

382
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:55,219
Ms Aurora, you're at the hospital.
- What a nuisance!

383
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:57,688
Well, maybe I'll get my pills.

384
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:03,360
Will you wake me if I fall asleep?
- Don't worry, It won't take long.

385
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:06,163
Don't just stand there, Santa.

386
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:10,568
You must check the crocodile regularly.
- What crocodile?

387
00:41:11,335 --> 00:41:13,771
I think you're kidding me sometimes.

388
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:16,207
How many crocodiles have we got?

389
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:21,645
Go check before the cheeky bugger
hides in Mr Ventura's house again!

390
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,480
It's completely obsessed with him...

391
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:29,220
You should get some rest, Ms Aurora.

392
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,689
How can I
if the darn crocodile

393
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:34,925
is always trying
to get into Gian Luca's house?

394
00:41:36,026 --> 00:41:37,928
What if he bites his finger off?

395
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:42,399
If then you ask for miracles
Death, error, all calamities,

396
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:46,103
Leprosy and demons fly,
And health succeeds infirmities.

397
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:48,606
The sea obeys and fetters break,
And lifeless limbs you do restore;

398
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,575
While treasures lost
are found again...

399
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:09,720
Hi, Santa.
- Hi, Ms Pilar.

400
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:13,324
Is she here?
- No, visits are over today.

401
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:15,659
What did the doctor say?
- Nothing to me.

402
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:17,660
Her daughter?
- Doesn't answer.

403
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:20,990
You must find this gentleman.
Madam wants to see him.

404
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:28,839
But you must be quick.
Madam is dying.

405
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:49,927
Are you a Jehovah's Witness?

406
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:52,396
I'm Catholic.
- So am I.

407
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:55,699
Can I help you?

408
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:59,236
This may sound weird,

409
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:01,972
but is there a Mr Ventura here,
by any chance?

410
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:03,841
That's me.

411
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:05,943
Gian Luca Ventura?

412
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,647
That's the old man. He's in a home.

413
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,448
Is he your father?

414
00:44:11,882 --> 00:44:14,685
My great-uncle.
He lived here some years ago.

415
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:16,620
I need to talk to him.

416
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:20,290
Well, a friend of mine does,
she's a friend of your uncle.

417
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:24,228
Come in.
Make yourself a t home.

418
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:29,466
The dogs are harmless.
They like children.

419
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:32,102
Oops! But I am not a child...

420
00:44:32,936 --> 00:44:34,238
But you're kind.

421
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:36,974
Dogs can see that and so can I.

422
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:43,847
I didn't know
the old man had any friends.

423
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:48,118
I only heard of him yesterday.
I thought he didn't actually exist.

424
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:52,356
Yes, he does.
But he's gone bonkers.

425
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:56,760
"Rising Sun" nursing home

426
00:45:33,697 --> 00:45:35,265
Gian Luca Ventura.

427
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,695
Yes. It's me, Santa.

428
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:07,490
I'm on my way to the hospital
with Mr Ventura

429
00:46:17,009 --> 00:46:21,545
- Yes, I am... -I wasn't
expecting it so early.

430
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:41,298
3 January

431
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:45,455
"In loving memory of my mother"

432
00:49:05,676 --> 00:49:07,077
Mr Ventura,

433
00:49:07,477 --> 00:49:10,280
will you join us for coffee
before you go home?

434
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:07,204
She had a farm in Africa...

435
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:12,075
Pardon?

436
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:27,357
Aurora had a farm in Africa
at the foothill of Mount Tabu.

437
00:50:32,462 --> 00:50:34,197
She never met her mother.

438
00:50:34,931 --> 00:50:37,934
She died after giving birth,
lamenting the time wasted

439
00:50:38,802 --> 00:50:41,505
closed in a bedroom
to scape the mosquitoes,

440
00:50:41,638 --> 00:50:45,542
read romantic novels
and heal a chronic headache.

441
00:50:48,345 --> 00:50:50,013
Her dad, a man of easy wrath,

442
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:53,917
has abandones a small
industrial wool empire in Portugal,

443
00:50:54,418 --> 00:50:56,820
because he resented the monarchy.

444
00:50:57,654 --> 00:51:00,690
He settled in Africa,
where he was successful again

445
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:05,128
exporting
cushions of ostrich feathers worldwide,

446
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:07,764
famous for their softness and elegance.

447
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:14,404
Had it not been
for his gambling addiction,

448
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:16,807
Aurora
would have inherited a fortune.

449
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:20,844
PART TWO.
PARADISE

450
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:38,028
Aurora grew up
according to her social status,

451
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:41,865
between private tutors
and black servants.

452
00:51:44,568 --> 00:51:46,970
Bur her gracefulness
in reciting verses

453
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:49,506
did not stop her
from malicious behaviour

454
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,942
in which
some saw devilish influences,

455
00:51:52,742 --> 00:51:55,979
others saw
whims of a spoiled childhood.

456
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:03,920
Before his apoplexy, her dad
was proud of his daughter's feats,

457
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:08,158
recognising the traits
of a strong temperament.

458
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:14,731
The father's death made her
more of a dreamer and introspective.

459
00:52:14,898 --> 00:52:17,300
Her talent for big game hunting,

460
00:52:18,268 --> 00:52:20,637
for which she became famous worlwide,

461
00:52:21,037 --> 00:52:23,607
was due to her father's influence.

462
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:26,743
She was a hunting consultant
in the film

463
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:29,779
"It Will Never Snow Again
over Kilimanjaro",

464
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:34,718
an RKO box office flop

465
00:52:35,418 --> 00:52:38,221
that caused the producer
to commit suicide.

466
00:52:40,357 --> 00:52:44,661
Aurora didn't care:
cinema bored her to death.

467
00:52:47,797 --> 00:52:50,400
When hunting elephants,
lions and leopards

468
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:53,803
she was truly chasing
her father's memory,

469
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:56,239
something she felt
ever more present

470
00:52:56,439 --> 00:52:58,842
when running through
the vast savannah.

471
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:13,723
This inflexion
in Aurora's character

472
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:15,692
benefited her studies.

473
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:19,796
She studied German

474
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:22,365
at an Anglophone University.

475
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:27,037
She met her husband
at the graduation ball.

476
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:33,043
The look of this confident posture
greatly impressed her,

477
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:36,179
as well as
the perfection of his waltz.

478
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:43,386
The couple set up home

479
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,922
on the western slope of Mount Tabu.

480
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:50,227
The mythical hill
was generous to all:

481
00:53:51,161 --> 00:53:53,096
it offered Aurora's husband

482
00:53:53,296 --> 00:53:56,166
the perfect climate for his tea crops,

483
00:53:56,967 --> 00:53:58,935
the academics
the hope of having found

484
00:53:59,102 --> 00:54:01,171
the cradle of humanity,

485
00:54:01,438 --> 00:54:04,407
and the natives
their indispensable local myths.

486
00:54:06,042 --> 00:54:10,146
The natives saw
their ancestors' avenging spirits

487
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:14,217
in the haze that descended
from the mountain at dusk.

488
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:20,724
None of this occupied
Aurora's mind,

489
00:54:21,124 --> 00:54:23,426
she loved her husband
and was happy.

490
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:34,437
But her taste for adventure
was merely dormant,

491
00:54:35,038 --> 00:54:37,440
numbed by the extravagant presents

492
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:39,843
that livened up her routine existence.

493
00:54:48,051 --> 00:54:51,054
Allow me to skip the misadventures

494
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:54,157
that led me to leave
my father's house in Genoa.

495
00:55:05,101 --> 00:55:08,772
I crossed the South Pacific
on a commercial vessel,

496
00:55:09,406 --> 00:55:12,275
docked in exotic Far Eastern towns

497
00:55:12,876 --> 00:55:15,278
and lived an infamous romance
in Paris

498
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:19,082
with a Hungarian countess,
unfortunately a married one.

499
00:55:19,683 --> 00:55:21,818
I broke many hearts in my time.

500
00:55:22,886 --> 00:55:25,322
That didn't benefit me

501
00:55:25,555 --> 00:55:27,957
nor give me any happiness.

502
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:34,497
I made easy money
and spent it effortlessly.

503
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:40,837
Ina bohemian night in Lisbon
I met Mario, a student priest.

504
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,441
An outsider like me,

505
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:48,178
he was celebrating
abandoning the dioceses

506
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:51,047
due to a lack of vocation.

507
00:55:53,283 --> 00:55:56,453
He spoke passionately
about his roots in Africa,

508
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:58,588
where he wanted to return.

509
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:05,929
These stories fuelled me,
so I told my new buddy

510
00:56:06,296 --> 00:56:09,065
of my firm decision to see his land.

511
00:56:13,103 --> 00:56:18,408
More than its promises
of exoticism and an easy life,

512
00:56:19,075 --> 00:56:21,277
Africa opened doors to a new world

513
00:56:21,444 --> 00:56:24,540
free of gambling debts
and love troubles.

514
00:56:30,086 --> 00:56:32,489
I had barely arrived
when I was offered

515
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:35,058
a good office job
ina respectable firm,

516
00:56:35,825 --> 00:56:37,460
with a schedule from 9 to 5.

517
00:56:41,297 --> 00:56:45,402
Santos e Irmão,
a small mining company,

518
00:56:45,602 --> 00:56:48,204
had a good reputation
for labour relations

519
00:56:48,371 --> 00:56:50,607
regarding white employees.

520
00:56:55,779 --> 00:56:57,547
My lack of ambition

521
00:56:58,281 --> 00:57:01,785
quickly made me
the bosses' right-hand man.

522
00:57:13,663 --> 00:57:15,860
Mario,
also known as the Priest,

523
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:19,702
the Sheriff,
the African and the Boss,

524
00:57:19,803 --> 00:57:22,372
was profuse
in passions and activities.

525
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:26,142
His grandfather, the community's
pioneer and spiritual leader,

526
00:57:26,676 --> 00:57:29,270
had been sent there for life

527
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:32,010
when the colony
was mainly a colonial prison.

528
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,522
Mario always wore
his grandfather's crucifix

529
00:57:39,689 --> 00:57:41,090
around his neck,

530
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:45,528
maybe because he couldn't fulfil
the old man's dream

531
00:57:45,695 --> 00:57:47,363
of becoming a priest.

532
00:57:49,065 --> 00:57:53,136
His vocal versality
delighted the African youngsters,

533
00:57:54,103 --> 00:57:56,639
and Mario,
a good cultivator of his ego,

534
00:57:56,773 --> 00:58:00,577
founded Mario's Band.

535
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:03,980
Women were sensitive to this charm

536
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:08,017
and my friend showed
a preference for the natives.

537
00:58:09,118 --> 00:58:11,221
He would father a child
with one of them

538
00:58:11,855 --> 00:58:17,293
an occasionally remembered
to take the boy out on a Sunday.

539
00:58:19,596 --> 00:58:24,100
At fifteen,
Mario had looked death in the eye.

540
00:58:26,703 --> 00:58:32,742
A tragic expedition to Mount Tabu
resulted in the deaths
of several youths.

541
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:39,649
Aurora's husband's crucial
intervention saved my friend.

542
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:44,320
I'm not aware
of the exact accident

543
00:58:44,487 --> 00:58:46,456
or haw he intervened.

544
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:50,527
But I believe both held sacred
the bond that was born then.

545
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:57,400
He invented
an impressive curriculum

546
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:00,203
and was accepted
as an assistant lecturer

547
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:03,230
in the Department of Geography
of the Faculty of Humanities

548
00:59:03,406 --> 00:59:04,641
of Coimbra.

549
00:59:05,141 --> 00:59:06,840
He never made the journey.

550
00:59:08,011 --> 00:59:10,947
The maps he designed
were very beautiful,

551
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:13,816
but, it later proved,
hardly scientific.

552
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:49,400
October

553
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:06,640
Despite living next to Aurora's farm

554
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:11,440
we only met months after my arrival.

555
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:34,720
My neighbors were looking
for the small crocodile

556
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:39,080
that had escaped from the lake
that Aurora had built on her farm.

557
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:45,120
I found the animal in my garden

558
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:49,440
and spent part of that evening
watching it move in the bathtub.

559
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:30,920
Aurora was happy when
she got the crocodile back.

560
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:38,440
Since her husband
was away on business,

561
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:41,120
she ordered lemonade
to be served outside,

562
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:43,960
following the customary
prudish etiquette.

563
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:54,080
To make small talk,
I asked about the animal's name.

564
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,400
She replied it had no name yet.

565
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:04,960
Aurora had many possessions.

566
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:08,240
but one was very peculiar:
the house cook...

567
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:12,520
who had been serving
the husband's family for decades.

568
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:16,040
a sage old man
of excellent cooking reputation.

569
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:19,480
He was also a sorcerer

570
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:25,000
and used to read the future
in the entrails of the animals
he prepared for the pot.

571
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,720
One October day,

572
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:38,680
after the first rains, he confided
words from the spirits to the maids

573
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,240
that Madam was pregnant.

574
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:45,760
and her end would be bitter and lonely.

575
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:52,520
But one of the maids betrayed him,

576
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:55,840
and the prophecies
reached Aurora's ears.

577
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:04,400
Furious, she fired him...

578
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:07,480
claiming that she could
no longer tolerate

579
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:10,200
such repugnant and heretical rituals.

580
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:17,320
Time, however, would prove
the first prediction right.

581
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:19,720
Aurora was expecting a baby.

582
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:23,560
and the husband,
who hoped for a vast succession,

583
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:26,680
was happy about his firstborn.

584
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:32,280
He celebrated the event... and
doubled his matrimonial attention.

585
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,920
After her initial euphoria,

586
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:44,120
Aurora became more reserved.

587
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:47,880
and wasn't passionate
about the subject.

588
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,520
November

589
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:54,800
Her husband attributed this to
a natural fear of maternity

590
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:58,080
and some harmless, slight bipolarity.

591
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:01,520
that he had noticed in her from before.

592
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,800
A rare beast, thought to be extinct,

593
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:30,080
was hear for weeks on the hills
from where came...

594
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:33,600
echoes of lonely
and excruciating growls.

595
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:38,520
Many chased it without success,

596
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,680
but Mario was the one to capture it.

597
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:45,240
Challenging a second time
the scary summit of Mount Tabu,

598
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:49,360
he made a triumphal descent
with the caged beast.

599
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:56,560
A powerful Arab caliph
soon bought it,

600
01:10:57,160 --> 01:11:00,400
giving my friend the first installment

601
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:05,520
of a vast sum that he would
never see in total.

602
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:11,120
Socialism would put
an end to the caliphate.

603
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,880
Ignorant of the revolution,

604
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,360
and thinking
he would have the money,

605
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:25,520
Mario accumulated debts and
splurged on various whims,

606
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:30,120
including recording a single
that would be the band's debut.

607
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:33,080
This record

608
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:36,360
is today a cult object
amongst music lovers

609
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,480
due to its rarity and simplicity.

610
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:20,960
December

611
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:13,160
Around Christmas,
the crocodile escaped again

612
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:18,680
and Aurora immediately knew
where to find it.

613
01:14:56,150 --> 01:15:01,460
We later found the crocodile
hidden under a cupboard.

614
01:15:06,930 --> 01:15:09,330
Since that fateful day

615
01:15:09,930 --> 01:15:14,140
Aurora secretly gave the animal
a romantic name:

616
01:15:15,770 --> 01:15:17,140
Dandy.

617
01:15:36,260 --> 01:15:39,200
The news that Aurora has missed a shot

618
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:40,730
caused quite a stir.

619
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:45,900
Her shotgun
had not fired a stray bullet

620
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:47,870
since her early youth.

621
01:15:48,570 --> 01:15:50,540
January

622
01:15:51,010 --> 01:15:54,510
It was thought the pregnancy
was linked to the incident

623
01:15:54,910 --> 01:15:59,880
and that maternity had the power
to sweeten her virile nature.

624
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:03,690
It would be Aurora's last hunt.

625
01:16:17,030 --> 01:16:21,200
Meanwhile there were rumours
of revolts and massacres

626
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:25,680
perpetrated by black people
elsewhere in the colony.

627
01:16:28,110 --> 01:16:30,580
In the quietness of our community

628
01:16:31,210 --> 01:16:35,250
the news sounded exaggerated
even unreal.

629
01:16:41,590 --> 01:16:47,400
The confirmation arrived
through a military officer

630
01:16:47,730 --> 01:16:51,570
carrying out
government information sessions.

631
01:16:53,970 --> 01:16:57,470
White folk got excited
and organised militias,

632
01:16:57,810 --> 01:17:02,810
night patrols
and did shooting exercises

633
01:17:03,380 --> 01:17:05,320
accompanied by tea and biscuits.

634
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:23,170
Indifferent to the fate
of the Empire,

635
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:27,170
I saw it as another opportunity
to be near her

636
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:32,410
even if her husband's presence
caused me a new and growing anxiety.

637
01:18:49,150 --> 01:18:52,160
February

638
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:18,010
I wonder, can anyone really understand

639
01:19:18,650 --> 01:19:21,250
the moment one goes
from desire to love?

640
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:25,090
I believe I have already said,

641
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,760
my past was
hardly deprived of pleasures,

642
01:19:28,330 --> 01:19:31,590
especially when socialising
with the ladies.

643
01:19:33,130 --> 01:19:36,200
Despite my fiery passions,

644
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:40,870
going from one woman to another
had never bothered me,

645
01:19:41,770 --> 01:19:44,470
as they all seemed very beautiful.

646
01:19:47,410 --> 01:19:50,810
Aurora irreversibly
overturned my nature,

647
01:19:51,250 --> 01:19:54,650
I'm not sure when
or for what obscure reason.

648
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:59,260
I couldn't ignore that Aurora
carried the child of another man,

649
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:01,090
her lawful husband,

650
01:20:01,660 --> 01:20:04,160
and that being her lover

651
01:20:04,890 --> 01:20:07,430
meant committing a colossal foolishness

652
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:10,970
that I could only live to regret.

653
01:20:12,770 --> 01:20:15,010
But in her arms,

654
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:18,610
the future
seemed a vague and stupid concept.

655
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:50,770
We met in secret
while the others played their wars.

656
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:59,580
The risk of being caught was high

657
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:05,180
but schemes to hide illicit affairs

658
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:08,350
were nothing new for me.

659
01:22:13,660 --> 01:22:16,530
The originality here
was of a different nature:

660
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:25,500
Aurora grew in me
as an absolute reality.

661
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:29,470
March

662
01:23:54,860 --> 01:23:57,880
My growing discomfort reached

663
01:23:57,881 --> 01:24:00,900
its climax at a party
in the pool house.

664
01:24:03,170 --> 01:24:07,970
Maybe the lugubrious aura of this place
stressed my restlessness.

665
01:24:10,670 --> 01:24:12,680
The parties there

666
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:17,180
owed their reputation
to the strange family that lived there.

667
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:22,750
The lady had run away, leaving son
and husband in charge of each other.

668
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:26,020
The son had been born
with feeble nerves,

669
01:24:26,660 --> 01:24:30,960
and later returned even
more perturbed after
a long stay in Marseille,

670
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:34,130
where he got involved
with the underworld

671
01:24:34,330 --> 01:24:37,430
and especialised in French boxing.

672
01:24:38,330 --> 01:24:40,335
In panic situations

673
01:24:40,336 --> 01:24:42,340
he would take flight
into another reality

674
01:24:43,010 --> 01:24:47,080
and, just like Don Quixote,
he'd fight invisible enemies.

675
01:24:48,980 --> 01:24:54,750
The father hid a feral despair
under a polished cloak of amiability.

676
01:24:56,020 --> 01:25:00,260
On New Year's Eve,
after a bottle of whiskey

677
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:05,760
he'd close the living room door,
load a bullet into the drum of a gun,

678
01:25:06,060 --> 01:25:09,330
raise it to his temple
and challenge life.

679
01:25:09,830 --> 01:25:13,300
He later died as a consequence of this.

680
01:25:17,270 --> 01:25:21,610
His parties often ended
with a gun salute,

681
01:25:21,810 --> 01:25:24,080
scaring the guests away.

682
01:26:27,580 --> 01:26:29,980
Due to my forbidden love.

683
01:26:30,910 --> 01:26:34,280
I had grown apart from Mario
in the last few weeks.

684
01:26:41,690 --> 01:26:46,160
I couldn't tell
how he'd react to my secret.

685
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:07,620
Mario evoked God,

686
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:12,890
he believed Divine Providence
had come to my aid.

687
01:27:14,060 --> 01:27:15,460
He showed me a letter

688
01:27:15,590 --> 01:27:18,160
from a famous singer
from a British colony

689
01:27:18,590 --> 01:27:21,000
who liked the band:

690
01:27:22,970 --> 01:27:28,810
an invitation to perform at a hotel
in the capital for a few months.

691
01:27:31,410 --> 01:27:34,680
Two days later I flew out there.

692
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:02,270
April

693
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:03,840
"My dear Lady,

694
01:28:04,540 --> 01:28:09,380
The sweet and ill-fated moments
we have lived in the last few weeks

695
01:28:10,010 --> 01:28:13,780
make me fear for my future
and above all for yours.

696
01:28:14,950 --> 01:28:18,920
The profound emotion I feel
when I'm next to you

697
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:23,560
puts me in a new, frightening position.

698
01:28:24,890 --> 01:28:27,360
I can't justify my actions.

699
01:28:28,330 --> 01:28:30,600
My heart begs me not to,

700
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:33,500
but I have made a final decision.

701
01:28:34,570 --> 01:28:38,740
I shall not see you anymore.
I believe this is the only way

702
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:40,910
to stop this horrendous crime.

703
01:28:42,180 --> 01:28:46,220
Conveniently,
fate brought the boys and me

704
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:50,120
a three-month contract
to play in a famous hotel abroad.

705
01:28:51,450 --> 01:28:55,090
My dear,
please think of yourself, your husband

706
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:58,560
and the child growing in your womb.

707
01:28:59,260 --> 01:29:01,630
I bid farewell with eternal sadness,

708
01:29:02,230 --> 01:29:03,600
yours forever,

709
01:29:04,130 --> 01:29:05,700
Gian Luca Ventura"

710
01:29:10,170 --> 01:29:11,540
"Dear Sir,

711
01:29:11,940 --> 01:29:16,050
Your fame made it easy for me
to find your address.

712
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:20,450
Your letter left me

713
01:29:21,250 --> 01:29:23,450
with fevers for several days.

714
01:29:24,550 --> 01:29:26,820
The nobility of your attitude

715
01:29:27,220 --> 01:29:30,730
brings me even more love for you,
something I thought was impossible.

716
01:29:32,060 --> 01:29:34,760
That nobility is,
however, my misfortune.

717
01:29:35,730 --> 01:29:37,970
I always thought I was a happy person,

718
01:29:38,170 --> 01:29:40,370
but the plenitude
I have found in your arms

719
01:29:41,570 --> 01:29:43,870
makes me the most doomed
of women today.

720
01:29:45,810 --> 01:29:49,450
Forget me if you can,
because I will always be yours,

721
01:29:50,210 --> 01:29:51,580
Aurora"

722
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:56,690
"My sweet and dear Aurora,

723
01:29:57,650 --> 01:29:59,260
It is you who must forget me...

724
01:29:59,420 --> 01:30:00,360
May

725
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:02,790
...because I will always be

726
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:04,790
a despicable villain.

727
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:08,760
I never thought, hpwever,
that in so much crookedness

728
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,730
my biggest crime
would be to fall in love.

729
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:16,040
I'd be lying if I denied
how much I still think of you.

730
01:30:17,270 --> 01:30:21,980
You would be scared
by some of the thoughts in my mind.

731
01:30:22,580 --> 01:30:28,320
They are the result of a juvenile
rapture with no chance of a future.

732
01:30:29,750 --> 01:30:31,420
I shall therefore silence myself,

733
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:32,890
and I beg you,

734
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:36,090
as I would beg to God
if I believed in Him,

735
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:38,160
to write to me no more.

736
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,700
Gian Luca Ventura"

737
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:47,040
"My dear Gian Luca,

738
01:30:47,740 --> 01:30:51,410
Those who claim time heals all wounds
have never loved as much as I have.

739
01:30:51,570 --> 01:30:54,240
I must confess this monstrosity to you:

740
01:30:54,710 --> 01:30:59,050
Neither my husband,
nor the unborn child, not even God

741
01:30:59,780 --> 01:31:03,250
bring me the slightest remorse
for our moments together.

742
01:31:03,890 --> 01:31:06,020
If I curse the day I met you

743
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:10,290
it's because it was followed
by the one when we separated.

744
01:31:10,930 --> 01:31:14,130
The image you keep of me
hardly resembles reality.

745
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:18,130
My biggest shame,
to love one man

746
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:21,400
and carry the offspring of another.

747
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:25,940
Yours always, Aurora"

748
01:31:41,020 --> 01:31:42,190
"Gian Luca,

749
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:46,600
Your lack of reply makes me think
you must have forgotten me.

750
01:31:47,330 --> 01:31:49,930
You do as you must
and I wish I could say

751
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:51,930
it makes me happy.

752
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:54,770
I have to exist

753
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:57,540
because the life I carry demands so.

754
01:31:57,810 --> 01:32:01,640
An innocent life,
despite my misadventures.

755
01:32:02,780 --> 01:32:06,520
I bid you farewell forever,
my dearest friend,

756
01:32:07,580 --> 01:32:10,890
yet telling you that,
now and forever,

757
01:32:12,020 --> 01:32:13,490
if you are ever to ask me,

758
01:32:14,290 --> 01:32:17,660
I will not hesitate to pull out
of my chest a beating heart,

759
01:32:17,890 --> 01:32:19,330
which is always yours,

760
01:33:37,810 --> 01:33:40,680
June

761
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:29,950
July

762
01:35:30,290 --> 01:35:34,960
In the following weeks,
I left my job and avoided friends.

763
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:42,130
August

764
01:36:52,940 --> 01:36:57,610
The mild way in which Mario demanded
I end the adventure was not comforting.

765
01:36:58,670 --> 01:37:04,310
I knew him well enough to recognise
the gravity of an ultimatum.

766
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:15,140
We took flight.

767
01:37:18,820 --> 01:37:22,805
Aurora's pregnancy required care,

768
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:25,920
but the proximity of the border
made up the risk

769
01:37:25,955 --> 01:37:27,440
of a night on the mountain.

770
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:49,130
We moved into an abandoned
house and watched the fire,

771
01:37:49,165 --> 01:37:52,350
trying to see in it signs of destiny.

772
01:39:39,130 --> 01:39:42,120
We were taken to a nearby village.

773
01:39:51,390 --> 01:39:54,555
Aurora had entered a state of silence

774
01:39:54,590 --> 01:39:58,460
interrupted by cries announcing
new contractions.

775
01:39:59,420 --> 01:40:03,505
Labor began after the death of Mario,

776
01:40:03,540 --> 01:40:07,540
and continued in a hovel whose
entrance was forbidden me,

777
01:40:07,575 --> 01:40:11,540
according to the implicit rules
of ancient matriarchal pact.

778
01:40:16,660 --> 01:40:20,590
I hoped to wake up
in a nightmare anytime absurd.

779
01:40:23,450 --> 01:40:28,390
I am aware that in the course
of this story did not hide
nor explained my attributes.

780
01:40:29,390 --> 01:40:35,500
But beyond madness samples
I still had some awareness.

781
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:39,175
Knowing that my lover's life
was at stake,

782
01:40:39,210 --> 01:40:44,150
and that our crime committed forever
a common future,

783
01:40:44,900 --> 01:40:48,790
I asked a boy from the village
to look for the husband of Aurora.

784
01:40:49,400 --> 01:40:51,765
renounced my project of flight,

785
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:54,795
and I was willing to plead..

786
01:40:54,796 --> 01:40:57,790
as his wife's kidnapper
and murderer Mario.

787
01:41:00,130 --> 01:41:03,025
The idea of spending
the rest of my life in prison

788
01:41:03,060 --> 01:41:06,320
or being pierced by a bullet
from the deceived husband,

789
01:41:06,355 --> 01:41:08,555
were good prospects

790
01:41:08,590 --> 01:41:13,410
compared with the desperate impasse
of my current condition.

791
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:25,880
It was announced
the birth of a child.

792
01:41:26,750 --> 01:41:30,145
The news spread quickly
through the village.

793
01:41:30,180 --> 01:41:37,240
The vision of Aurora with her daughter,
heartwarming for other eyes,

794
01:41:37,710 --> 01:41:41,490
was almost as unbearable
as Mario's body

795
01:41:41,820 --> 01:41:43,270
lying next to me.

796
01:41:44,240 --> 01:41:49,830
In short, I expected to it whatever.

797
01:43:59,590 --> 01:44:02,115
Al da siguiente se divulgara

798
01:44:02,150 --> 01:44:04,570
The next day a mysterious statement
be released on Mario's death,

799
01:44:04,605 --> 01:44:07,340
which today is taken
as one of the determinants factors

800
01:44:07,375 --> 01:44:08,990
for the beginning of the colonial war.

801
01:44:10,680 --> 01:44:14,495
<i>The freedom movement
admits responsability</i>

802
01:44:14,530 --> 01:44:18,850
<i>for the death of this member
of the colonialist militia</i>

803
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:21,425
<i>as an act of war.</i>

804
01:44:21,460 --> 01:44:25,790
<i>This representative
of the white occupation</i>

805
01:44:25,825 --> 01:44:29,290
<i>was shot in quadrant 45,</i>

806
01:44:29,325 --> 01:44:31,915
<i>Mukange,</i>

807
01:44:31,950 --> 01:44:37,195
<i>where he was caught spying</i>

808
01:44:37,230 --> 01:44:42,405
<i>on the strategic positions</i>

809
01:44:42,440 --> 01:44:49,290
<i>of the African revolutionary forces
for the opressive regime.</i>

810
01:44:49,790 --> 01:44:54,805
<i>Our popular forces
will continue the struggle</i>

811
01:44:54,840 --> 01:44:59,820
<i>for total freedom
of our people and country.</i>

812
01:45:17,690 --> 01:45:21,270
September

813
01:45:22,820 --> 01:45:26,810
I left Africa and Aurora's life forever

814
01:45:26,845 --> 01:45:28,570
two days later,

815
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:30,990
after receiving her final letter.

816
01:45:35,210 --> 01:45:37,795
It was in India, some ten years later,

817
01:45:37,830 --> 01:45:40,380
I learned of the death of her husband.

818
01:45:41,580 --> 01:45:45,190
By one of those strange
coincidences that life rarely gives us,

819
01:45:45,225 --> 01:45:49,070
I worked with someone
who also knew him.

820
01:45:51,180 --> 01:45:53,645
He was who gave me news of her,

821
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:56,190
and informed me of her
return to Lisbon,

822
01:45:56,750 --> 01:45:59,630
where she had moved with her daughter.

823
01:46:03,010 --> 01:46:05,305
Some friends also settled in Portugal

824
01:46:05,340 --> 01:46:08,930
and made Aurora reach the location
of my whereabouts.

825
01:46:12,760 --> 01:46:14,115
There was no answer.

826
01:46:14,150 --> 01:46:17,210
And despite this love,
never buried or defeated,

827
01:46:17,245 --> 01:46:19,750
I decided not to look for her.

828
01:46:22,750 --> 01:46:25,650
It is the first time
that I share this with someone.

829
01:46:26,830 --> 01:46:30,810
I did his will
and destroyed her letter:

830
01:46:35,950 --> 01:46:37,435
"Gian Luca, my love,

831
01:46:37,470 --> 01:46:43,480
I leave as soon as possible
and I leave behind these cursed lands.

832
01:46:43,515 --> 01:46:45,870
and the memory of the horror
that I lived in them.

833
01:46:46,600 --> 01:46:48,310
Nothing binds me to this place.

834
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:51,330
The woman who loved lies dead,

835
01:46:51,670 --> 01:46:54,600
buried under the shadow
of these impassive mountains.

836
01:46:57,490 --> 01:47:00,880
When God lift me,
my secrets will go with my shroud

837
01:47:00,915 --> 01:47:02,640
and like them, say nothing,

838
01:47:04,120 --> 01:47:06,680
because the memory of men
is limited,

839
01:47:06,715 --> 01:47:08,920
and beyond the world, eternal,

840
01:47:08,955 --> 01:47:10,860
and no one can escape it.

841
01:47:12,620 --> 01:47:14,605
In those crimes we
committed together,

842
01:47:14,640 --> 01:47:18,340
his participation
is not comparable with mine.

843
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:20,835
Mr. is foolish,

844
01:47:20,870 --> 01:47:24,020
and therefore not realized
he spent the last months

845
01:47:24,055 --> 01:47:27,135
with a wild unhappy woman,
who can remember fondly

846
01:47:27,170 --> 01:47:30,810
at the time where there will be
treacherous iniquities.

847
01:47:33,210 --> 01:47:36,165
I ask you to make
this sad letter ashes,

848
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:39,600
the last I will write
and that you won't respond.

849
01:47:40,640 --> 01:47:42,940
And that never can reveal,
in my lifetime,

850
01:47:42,950 --> 01:47:45,470
the monumental crimes we lived.

851
01:47:45,505 --> 01:47:47,040
Aurora".
