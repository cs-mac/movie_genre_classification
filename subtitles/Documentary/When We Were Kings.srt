1
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,760
Yeah, I'm in Africa.
Yeah, Africa's my home.

2
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,480
Damn America and what America thinks.

3
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,240
I live in America, but Africa's
the home of the Black man.

4
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,280
I was a slave 400 years ago

5
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,320
and I'm going back home to fight
among my brothers! Yeah!

6
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,440
'For these two African-Americans

7
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,040
'to come home was
of great, great significance.

8
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,440
'Because of Hollywood and TV

9
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,040
'a lot of us
had been taught to hate Africa.'

10
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,040
Once, if you called a Black person
African they'd be ready to fight.

11
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,320
'When I get to Africa we'll get
it on because we don't get along!'

12
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,240
I'm gonna eat him up!

13
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,840
Too much speed for him!
Too fast! Too fast!

14
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,080
I'm gonna retire the
heavyweight champion of the world!

15
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,680
I'm gonna retire
the heavyweight champion!

16
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,040
September 25th
the world'll be stunned!

17
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,760
Tell 'em, Ali!

18
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,000
If you think the world was surprised
when Nixon resigned

19
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,640
wait till I kick Foreman's behind!

20
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,320
'An 18-year-old amateur
champion with a charming smile

21
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,720
'took a physical examination
for his first professional fight.'

22
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,920
It won't be an easy fight

23
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,520
but my plan of attack
on a fighter like Alex Miteff

24
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,480
would be two fast left jabs,

25
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,520
a rapid right cross
and a left hook.

26
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,360
'But in the Belgian Congo,

27
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,040
'freedom was followed
by rioting and an army mutiny.

28
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,760
'For months,
the political pattern kept changing

29
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,840
'until pro-Red
Premier Lumumba was seized

30
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,040
'by the forces
of strongman Colonel Mobutu.'

31
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,560
After watching Mike DeJohn
and Eddie Machen,

32
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,680
I would rate myself number two.

33
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,960
I'm out to break
Floyd Patterson's record

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,160
and this being my 20th birthday,
today, January 17th,

35
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,000
that leaves me exactly one year
to reach my goal.

36
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,880
People do say I'm cocky,
some say I need a good whuppin',

37
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,000
some say I talk too much,

38
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,800
but anything that I say,
I'm willing to back up.

39
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,840
The other night I predicted

40
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,640
that I would knock out Banks
in four rounds and I did.

41
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,600
I knocked out Don Warner

42
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,680
and I just annihilated
George Logan in four rounds.

43
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,520
'Close your mouth
and keep it closed.'

44
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,280
- That's impossible.
- Keep it closed.

45
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,240
I'm the greatest
and I'm knocking out all bums.

46
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,640
And if you get too smart
I'll knock you out.

47
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,800
'You'd take him on
before the fight?'

48
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,720
Beat him like I'm his daddy.

49
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,880
I saw Sonny Liston a few days ago.

50
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,840
Ain't he ugly?

51
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,160
I'm young, I'm handsome,

52
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,640
I'm fast, I'm pretty
and can't possibly be beat.

53
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,720
Cassius Clay
goes into the record book

54
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,640
with Corbett, Tunney and Braddock,

55
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,160
bringing off another great upset
in heavyweight history.

56
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,720
It is befitting that I leave
the game just like I came in,

57
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,360
beating a big bad monster
who knocks out everybody

58
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,280
and no one can whup him.

59
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,760
When little Cassius Clay
stopped Sonny Liston,

60
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,240
the man who annihilated
Floyd Patterson twice.

61
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,160
He was gonna kill me!

62
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,280
But he hit harder than George.

63
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,200
His reach is longer,
he's a better boxer

64
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,160
and I'm better now than when you saw
that kid running from Sonny Liston.

65
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,800
I'm experienced now, professional.

66
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,280
Jaw's been broke, been knocked down
a couple of times, I'm bad!

67
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,400
Been chopping trees,
I done something new.

68
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,600
- I wrestled with an alligator.

69
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,080
That's right,
I have wrestled with an alligator!

70
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,200
I tussled with a whale. I handcuffed
lightning, thrown thunder in jail!

71
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,600
That's bad!
Only last week I murdered a rock!

72
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,280
Injured a stone!
Hospitalised a brick!

73
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,680
- I'm so mean I make medicine sick!
- Bad dude!

74
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,480
Bad, fast!

75
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,160
Fast! Fast! Last night,
cut the light off in my bedroom,

76
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,280
hit the switch and was in the bed
before the room was dark!

77
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,280
- Incredible.
- Fast!

78
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,440
You, George Foreman, all you chumps
are gonna bow when I whup him!

79
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:00,040
All of you! I know you got him picked
but the man's in trouble!

80
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,720
I'm gonna show you how great I am!

81
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,640
I think Ali was scared.
I think he was scared even then.

82
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,200
He knew he was gonna be very scared
as he got closer to the fight.

83
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,480
You know the way George fights.

84
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,680
George comes out...
"I made him the mummy!"

85
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:23,440
'With his ego he could tell
himself he would dominate Foreman,

86
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:28,640
'make a fool of him, that Foreman
would never lay a glove on him.'

87
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,320
But in fact, in his sleep
or wherever his private moment came

88
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:37,520
he knew that he had not done as well
against two fighters particularly,

89
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,560
Joe Frazier and Ken Norton,
whom Foreman had demolished.

90
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,440
Down goes Frazier!
Down goes Frazier!

91
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,480
The heavyweight champion
is taking the mandatory eight count

92
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,920
and Foreman is as poised as can be!

93
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,280
Foreman is going about his job!

94
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,480
'He had an overpowering
intensity when he punched.

95
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,560
'Foreman won
by knocking Joe Frazier out

96
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,520
'and knocked him down
something like seven times.

97
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,760
'Then he destroyed Ken Norton
in two rounds.

98
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:13,240
'The word "murderous" does not
quite apply, Foreman was awesome.'

99
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,000
This chump has got everybody scared.

100
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:20,080
Scared of what?
There's nothing to be scared of.

101
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,320
Scared of what?

102
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,880
How many fellas in here
picks George? Be truthful, be men.

103
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,520
Tell the truth.

104
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,680
- John, raise your hand.

105
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,480
Got George?

106
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,680
You got George. Tell the truth.

107
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,160
You! You, fella. Yeah.

108
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,280
No pick? I just wanna know.
You got George...

109
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,360
The time may have come
to say goodbye to Muhammad Ali,

110
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,960
because very honestly I don't think
he can beat George Foreman.

111
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Howard Cosell, you told everybody
I don't have a chance.

112
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,040
Told 'em I don't have
nothing but a prayer.

113
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,160
Well, chump, all I need is a prayer
because if that reaches the right man

114
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,800
not only will George Foreman fall
but mountains will fall!

115
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,160
Maybe he can pull off a miracle,

116
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,560
but against George Foreman?

117
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,360
So young, so strong, so fearless?

118
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,400
Against George Foreman,
who does away with his opponents

119
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,600
one after another
in less than three rounds?

120
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,280
It's hard for me
to conjure with that.

121
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,560
You always say "Muhammad, you're not
the same man you were 10 years ago."

122
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,080
I asked your wife

123
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,320
and she told me you're not the same
man you was two years ago!

124
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,720
After this fight
I suspect Ali will retire.

125
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,920
And through all of the years

126
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:50,160
my own memories of him
will be as a fighter,

127
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,360
and as the strange and curious
and gregarious and engaging

128
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:01,680
and sometimes cruel,
and sometimes family man that he is.

129
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,720
I'm gonna let everybody know
that that thing on your head

130
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,040
is a phoney
and it comes from the tail of a pony.

131
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,280
A stolen bicycle.

132
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,160
He had a bicycle
and he went to Columbia Gym.

133
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,240
There was something going on up there
and he left his bike parked outside.

134
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,160
So when he came out
someone had stolen it

135
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,680
and he went inside and he was crying

136
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,920
and he told the policeman there,
his name was Joe Martin,

137
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,040
that someone stole his bike.

138
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,360
And Joe Martin, he also taught the
little boys how to box in the evening

139
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,320
so he asked would he be interested
in learning how to box

140
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,880
and he told him yes, because if he
ever found out who stole his bike

141
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,680
he wanted to know how to fight
so he could beat them up.

142
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,280
An overhand right
sends Sonny to the canvas!

143
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,000
Referee Jersey Joe Walcott is trying
to get Ali to a neutral corner.

144
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,400
Ali yelling at Liston to get up...

145
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,320
- Anchor punch.
- Which fight?

146
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,640
I call it the anchor punch.

147
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,400
- The one Stepin Fetchit helped with?
- Yeah, man.

148
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,200
People couldn't see it,

149
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,600
it was so fast Sports Illustrated
got a slow-motion camera,

150
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:20,160
they clocked the punch and the punch
flew at 4/100ths of a second.

151
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,520
You can break a second
down to 100 pieces.

152
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,560
When people win a ski race
they say one and 16/100ths,

153
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,720
one and 32/100ths of a second,

154
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:33,320
so you break a second into 100 pieces
so, you know...that's quick,

155
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,880
they got a machine that goes,
like, fr-r-t, real quick, fr-r-t,

156
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,520
and it counts real quick, real quick.

157
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,160
And by the time that thing
hit four that's how quick,

158
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,360
from the time the punch started
to where it landed

159
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,840
was 4/100ths of a second,
an eye blink, like a camera flash.

160
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,960
That's 4/100ths of a second.

161
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,520
When I hit Sonny Liston
all those people blinked,

162
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,440
so they didn't see it.

163
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,800
- I swear!

164
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,960
If you watch the film close,
keep your eyes real close...

165
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,120
- Keep looking.

166
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,400
I'm getting ready to hit him.

167
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:15,000
You got to hold your eyes and wait
or you won't see it, man!

168
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,080
Ali was a beautiful...specimen,

169
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,840
a fighting machine.

170
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:25,200
He was handsome,
he was articulate, he was funny,

171
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,120
charismatic.

172
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,680
And was whuppin' ass too.

173
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,440
'Deposed champion
Cassius Clay, at court in Houston,

174
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,480
'is found guilty of violating
Selective Service laws

175
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,600
'by refusing to be inducted.

176
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:43,360
'He is sentenced to five years
in prison and fined $10,000.'

177
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,560
'The way he fused
politics and sports.

178
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,360
'Very few Black athletes had ever
talked the way Muhammad Ali talked

179
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,000
'without fear of something
happening to their careers.'

180
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,120
'..as a Moslem minister
made him exempt...'

181
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,320
'He was already very unpopular
with mainstream Americans

182
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,440
'because he had joined
the Nation of Islam,

183
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,320
'which was perceived as
a radical Black separatist group.'

184
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,760
On top of that,
when he was called for induction

185
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,360
he refused to take the step forward.

186
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,960
He absolutely infuriated America.

187
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,880
Muhammad Ali said,
"No Viet Cong ever called me nigger."

188
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,440
The king is going home
to get his throne.

189
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,800
From root to fruit,
that's where everything started at.

190
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,480
This is God's act
and you're part of it.

191
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,920
This is no Hollywood set,
this is real.

192
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,080
Hollywood set up these scenes,

193
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,560
have somebody in the movies
playing his life.

194
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,600
We don't pick up a script.

195
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,560
We get up in the morning,

196
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,440
sometimes we feel good,
sometimes bad,

197
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,840
but we go through it with feeling.

198
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,280
'Muhammad Ali's a prophet, he gonna
be a fisherman for Elijah Muhammad.

199
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,920
'This is only a stop, look and
listen sign he's doing, fighting.'

200
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,640
We been fightin' ever since we met.

201
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,920
We beat Uncle Sam, come out
of the garage and beat number two.

202
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,600
First man ever did it. Rest of 'em
they put out of the country.

203
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,800
'This is God's act,
we just actors in it.

204
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,440
'If Jesus was here
everybody'd want his autograph

205
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,400
'and they'd be filming him.

206
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,280
'This is a sport,
that's why you walking, talk to him.'

207
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,280
I think Muhammad is a prophet.
How you gonna beat God's son?

208
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,800
Anybody who loves poor people
and little people gotta be a prophet.

209
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,880
He was champion of the world,
had a table full of food.

210
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:39,640
Had a house for his mother, one for
him and he told 'em to shove it.

211
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:45,280
If he couldn't love his god,
what do you think he is...mister?

212
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,240
'Ali trained for the Foreman
fight at Deer Lake, Pennsylvania.

213
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,840
'He trained very hard
for that fight,

214
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,560
'and had very good sparring partners.

215
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,880
'Larry Holmes was one of them.

216
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:15,480
'I was struck with how well
he actually handled Ali

217
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,120
'in their sparring sessions.

218
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,160
'He dominated Ali.
That wasn't uncommon.

219
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,720
'Ali would often not show his best
stuff with sparring partners,

220
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,840
'but would work on his weaknesses.

221
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,280
'He'd go against the ropes
and let people pummel him,

222
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,560
'very heavy hitters,
he'd let them bang away at him.

223
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,800
'As if he was training his body to
receive these messages of punishment

224
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,360
'and absorb them faster than other
fighters could absorb them.'

225
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,600
'This is in Africa because
they came up with $10 million.'

226
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,040
$5 million for George Foreman,

227
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,920
$5 million for me.

228
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,040
England was trying to get it.
A promoter said America was trying,

229
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,080
but none could surpass
the $5 million mark.

230
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,360
The dream is becoming a reality.

231
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,400
'Don King
went to George Foreman

232
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,720
'and got him to sign an agreement

233
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,840
'saying that if King could deliver
$5 million, Foreman would fight Ali.

234
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,560
'Then King went to Ali
and made the same deal,

235
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,320
'so Don King now had both fighters,

236
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,240
'their signatures
on a piece of paper.

237
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,040
'What he didn't have
was $10 million.'

238
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,000
..a festival to complement
this great sporting event,

239
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,920
the greatest sporting event
in history.

240
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,960
- Of all time!
- All time, as the champ says.

241
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,960
Greatest event of all time!

242
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,480
Bigger than Evel Knievel and
the Kentucky Derby on the same day.

243
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,760
The president of Zaire was willing
to put $10 million

244
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:53,120
of his country's own very scarce,
hard-earned currency on the line,

245
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,120
not for any
short-term economic reason

246
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,680
but because he felt
that the fight would be good

247
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:04,480
in terms of promoting Zaire and also
in terms of promoting himself,

248
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,400
and as Ali said at the time,

249
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,800
countries go to war
to get their names on the map

250
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,760
and wars cost
a lot more than $10 million.

251
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,120
Some of the most dynamic
performers from Afro-America

252
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:21,680
will appear at the stadium in
Kinshasa on the 20th, 21st and 22nd,

253
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,240
with this theatrical release.

254
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,840
It will be James Brown,
soul brother number one...

255
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,640
- Is he playing?
- Yes, James Brown will be there.

256
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,680
We will have BB King, The Spinners...

257
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,880
This is the first assembly in history
where the top-notch Blacks of America

258
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:45,720
and the people of Africa had
something together, all on a level,

259
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,240
we're all meeting and learning more
about each other,

260
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:53,440
the first assembly among American
Black men and Africans in history

261
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,360
and it's a big honour.

262
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,360
Plus I gotta whup George!

263
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,240
'Got to whup George!'

264
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,720
We're gonna rumble in the jungle!

265
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,840
Come on, come on.

266
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,840
Speak up, boy. Go ahead.

267
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,520
- Good boy.

268
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,280
Get down.

269
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,240
- Quiet.
- George?

270
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:26,080
Is this fight against Ali
the toughest of your career?

271
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,560
Could be, could be. I doubt it.

272
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,040
This is Muhammad Ali, September 10th
at New York City airport,

273
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,240
en route to Zaire to reclaim
the heavyweight title of the world.

274
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,960
Champ, what would you like to say
to the children of the world?

275
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,600
I'd like to say, mainly where they
understand English in America,

276
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,240
to...live a clean life,
stay off the dope.

277
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,560
It's tearing the country up.

278
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,120
Also, if they wanna be like me,
I'm going to whup George Foreman,

279
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,240
and when they see this
I will have beaten him.

280
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,040
Tell them to quit eating
so much candy,

281
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,160
I have three rotten teeth
and I had to have one of 'em pulled,

282
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,480
I can't chew my food like I should.

283
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:21,160
Eat natural foods
because we must whup Mr Tooth Decay.

284
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,800
I got one right there and one there.

285
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,680
Ali told us he's going to use part
of his money to build a hospital.

286
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,880
Do you intend to use part of your
money for something, a project?

287
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,320
He may think
he may have to be in the hospital.

288
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,520
I want the man!

289
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:45,040
When I get to Africa we gonna
get it on because we don't get along!

290
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,520
I don't like him, he talks too much.

291
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,800
- Beg your pardon?
- You would continue boxing

292
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,520
- even if you lose?
- I beg your pardon?

293
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,720
- You don't think about losing?

294
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,880
No. But thank you.
Nice talking to you.

295
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,800
Flying over the Sahara desert.

296
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:09,280
An African airline with all African
stewardesses, all African pilots.

297
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,840
This is the first free feeling
I had in a long time.

298
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,360
Ain't this something, flying in
an airplane with Black pilots?

299
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,600
All Black crew? This is strange
to the American Negro.

300
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,720
We never dreamed of this!

301
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,600
Every time we watch TV they show us
Tarzan and the natives and jungles,

302
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,400
they never told us that Africans
were more intelligent than we are.

303
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,280

French and African.

304

as a boxer,

for his political stance.

with a Third World country, Vietnam,

- 22 million.
- 22 million?

334

- 22 million.
- How many George Foreman fans here?

335

- So many we cannot count them.

we realised he was black, like Ali.

a ticket to get on the plane.'

Yeah, when are gonna get to Zee-air?

- Mobutu land.

The plane is not coming in at six,
it's now coming in between 10 and 11,

389
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,880
so you don't have to have those
trucks up to the airport that early.

Six, fifth and fourth are done.
Elevators are working.

There's no air conditioning at all?

394

What do you mean, 80%?
What floor is out?

396
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,240
I have sixth, fifth and fourth.

397
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,600
I understand, but what about...

398
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,000
It's individual
air conditioning controls...

399
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,960
What apartments
have air conditioning?

400
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,280
How many beds
can we move people into tonight?

401
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,800
- Four. Four rooms.
- Just eight people?

402
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,320
Yeah.

403

00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,920
Hello, bubba!

417
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,720
How you doin'?

418
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,520
Ready to dance? I got ants
in my pants, I gotta dance.

419
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,960
'The fight was held in Zaire,
the former Belgian Congo.

420
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,920
'Kinshasa was the capital
on the banks of the Congo,

421

'this was just before
the rainy season.'

422
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,600
Up to the north
was the flickering of storms,

423
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,920
and it was important to the promoters

424
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,880
that this fight get in
before the storms occurred,

425
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,480
because once the rainy season comes
you can't do anything.

426
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,480
The Congo had such a wonderful name,
Conradian and all that.

427
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,240
To call it Zaire
didn't have quite the majesty,

428
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,240
but there it was, the Congo.

429
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,040
'Mobutu was everywhere.

430

'He was the equivalent of Stalin.'

00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,800
'You saw his picture everywhere.'

Part of the vanity of dictators,
with the exception of Mussolini,

433
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,600
who was half ugly
and half attractive,

434
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,200
most dictators are unbelievably ugly
or plain - Franco, Hitler...

435
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:48,320
'Mobutu looked the archetype,
the epitome of a closet sadist.

'"Who are the poor women
who are associated with this fella?"

438
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:06,440
'And since Mobutu was
an extraordinarily practical man,

'down under the stadium,
which seated 100,000 people,

440
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,600
'were detention pens
and rooms and chambers

as a couple of thousand people.

'Before the fight came, the criminal
rate in Zaire began to go up.'

443
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:28,240
A few white foreigners
had been killed, driving their cars.

444
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:33,440
And Mobutu decided that this would be
a disaster in terms of publicity,

445
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:40,400
so on a given day he had a thousand
of the leading criminals in Kinshasa

446
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:46,200
rounded up and put in this stadium,
down in the detention pens.

'And then the legend has it, and I
suspect the legend may even be true,

448
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,680
'that he had 100
taken at random and killed them.

449
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,480
'And the reason was
a particularly simple one

450

'from Mobutu's point of view.'

451
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:04,040
Career criminals have connections who
protect them when they're in trouble,

452
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,720
and by making this kill
of 100 out of 1,000 arbitrarily,

453
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:12,440
Mobutu was saying "Your connections
are worth nothing. I am Jehovah.

454
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,120
'"I will blast you out of existence

'He made his point, Kinshasa was
one of the safest cities in Africa,

press was there for the fight.'

00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:51,720
'To me, the drum was the communicator
since the beginning of time,

458
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,960
'I'm sure it was
the first message ever sent.

459
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,160
'The beat today
and the beats centuries ago

460
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,440
'are the only thing
that's kept us together.'

461
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:11,000
We had this thing, when we hurt,
we sung for trial and tribulation,

462
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,800
and for relief, we sung songs to God

463
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,520
and this music that you hear today
is the same songs

464
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:22,400
that have been made popular around
the world without any volition.

465
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,760
Oh!

466
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,880

00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,720
'about the rhythm and the blues
as they're so-called,

468
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,880

# When I first met you, baby

470
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,240
# Baby, you were just

471
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,160
# Sweet sixteen

472

# When I first met you, baby

473

# Baby, you was just sweet sixteen

474

# Oh, the sweetest thing
I'd ever seen #

476
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,440
The music I listen to, in most white
people's houses, I don't hear this,

477
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,560
because your culture wouldn't...

478
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:04,880
Your woman doesn't leave you
and slip away like our women,

479
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,840
because you had money
to keep your woman.

480
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:12,320
Your songs are like, "And the train
comes around that mountain,

481
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:16,280
"In the Folsom Prison,
in the Folsom Prison".

482
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,840
You know, "Y'all come, y'all come."

483
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,720
Chinese got diddly music,
"Pleen ting tang tong ting."

484
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:27,080
I don't want that and he understands.
Everybody's got their culture.

485
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:32,200
So we're not saying we hate you
or we're never talking to you again

486
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,840
and doing business, we don't do that.

487
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,240
We're saying
that we want to be independent.

488
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,000
# Baby, I wonder

489
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,520
# Yes, I wonder

490
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,400
# Baby, I wonder

491
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:54,160
# Oh, I wonder what in the world
is gonna happen to me #

492
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,360
'The great place
to visit in Kinshasa

493
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,080
'was a compound
about 20 miles up the Congo.

494
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,720
'A place called Enseli,
a presidential palace.

495
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,080
'That was where we saw Foreman,
who seemed incredible.'

496
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,840
I'd seen him fight before,
I saw him destroy Frazier

497
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:24,040
and the thing I always remembered
was that the beaten fighter,

498
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,000
even a man as powerful
and big as Frazier,

499
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,960
and he was very much favoured
to win that,

500
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,600
suddenly becomes the size of a pygmy.

501
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:35,280
They just diminish in size,

502
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:39,600
and Foreman suddenly became
this gigantic figure.

503
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:45,480
'And he had a trainer, Dick Sadler,
tiny by comparison,

504
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:50,400
'and Sadler would hang on to this
heavy bag while Foreman would hit it.

505
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,840
'Sadler would have been
picked off his feet.'

506
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,520
'Foreman hitting the bag

507
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:02,280
'is one of the more prodigious sights
I've had in my life.

508
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,760
'Of all the people I've seen hit
heavy bags, including Sonny Liston,

509
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,200
'no one hit it the way Foreman did.'

510
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:13,480
At the end of 15 minutes
of pounding the heavy bag,

511
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,880
there'd be a hole,
not a hole but a huge dent,

512
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,240
the size of half a small watermelon
in that tremendous bag,

513
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,760
and Foreman used to use
the biggest heavy bag around.

514
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:30,160
'What would be interesting is Ali,
who would train after Foreman,

515
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:34,280
'would pass this large hall
where the training took place

516
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,560
'and he never looked at Foreman
hitting the heavy bag.

517
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,920
'He just walked right by
as if Foreman didn't exist.

518
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,120
'If you were gonna fight the man

519
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:46,840
'you didn't want to see him
hitting that heavy bag.'

520
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,640
I'm a speed demon!
I'm a brain fighter!

521
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,840
I'm scientific! I'm artistic!

522
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,800
I plan my strategy!

523
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,920
He's the bull, I'm the matador!

524
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,280
He's scared to death.

525
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,680
He's scared to death!

526
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,760
He wish he could
get out of the whole thing!

527
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,480
He wish he could get out of the whole
thing! The man is frightened!

528
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:16,360
He's meetin' his master,
his teacher, his idol!

529
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,720
- Time!
- Is that all?

530
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,120
When I talk and work I'm in shape,
it's all I do.

531
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,440
'Ali announced
he was gonna dance.

532
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,600
'He spoke about it all the time.

533
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,520
'Every interview
in that period he'd say

534
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:37,680
'"How is Foreman going to get
near to me? I'm going to dance!

535
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:42,440
'"I'm going to dance and dance! He'll
look foolish trying to find me.'

536
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,000
"And as he gropes his way forward

537
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,880
"in this storm of blindness
at the speed of my dancing

538
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,000
"I will strike him with my jab!

539
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,960
"Poo! Poo! Poo!"
he would go and so forth.

540
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,720
We heard this over and over
and Foreman heard it too.

541
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:03,040
'Foreman was working now on
what's called cutting off the ring.

542
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,280
'This essentially just means

543
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:09,480
'cornering your opponent
against the ropes or in a corner.

544
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,920
'It's an art, a balletic art,
you have to have very good footwork.

545
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,200
'Foreman's footwork,
he was a big man,

546
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,400
'but his footwork was better
than anyone had expected.

547
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,640
'He worked with very fast fighters,

548
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,640
'smaller than himself,
who certainly could dance

549
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,760
'and he worked on cornering them.

550
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,120
'And the combination
of watching the heavy bag

551
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,920
'and watching Foreman
cut off the ring

552
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,160
'made most fight writers,
myself included,

553
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,800
'pessimistic about Ali's chances.'

554
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:17,240
The guy threw up his elbows
to protect himself from Foreman

555
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,880
and Foreman walked into his elbow.

556
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,920
That's how he got cut in the eye?

557
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,000
What else can happen?

558
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,480
I saw the man's cut
and this man cannot fight.

559
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,680
This man cannot fight
for a world championship...

560
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,320
- You're not a doctor.
- I don't give a damn. I know what...

561
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:48,120
The Zaireans kicked us out
and they did not want us around,

562
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,080
and they want the fight to go on,
that's all there is to it.

563
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,040
He won't fight with that eye,
he's not dumb.

564
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,800
He's not that dumb?

565
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,400
That's all you want is a fight.

566
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,280
Excuse me, gentlemen.

567
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,760
I respectfully ask are the fighters
remaining here because they want to

568
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,040
or has the government
requested they remain?

569
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:25,920
Mr Sadler told me
to convey to the press

570
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,920
that it is just an accident.

571
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,760
They will be contacting
the promoters of the fight

572
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:35,480
and it is possible
that we may have to delay the fight

573
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,880
and he will let the press know
as soon as possible.

574
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,400
Did they have to stitch Foreman?

575
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,360
They had to stitch him.
Holy shit, man.

576
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,360
So how long is the delay?

577
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,760
It'll take a day to get
any intelligence, this just happened.

578
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,880
Then we can make a decision.

579
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,840
How does George feel?

580
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,960
Like anybody, he's only human.
How would any individual feel?

581
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,640
Does he want it postponed?

582
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,560
Who? Why should he?

583
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:08,160
- Should he go ahead with it?
- Why should he make any decision?

584
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,840
Who knows what another man thinks?

585
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,840
How could I truthfully tell you
what you would think?

586
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,160
A man may have mixed emotions,
I couldn't speak for George,

587
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,840
I can only speak for Dick Sadler,
not for somebody else.

588
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,920
I'm not that intelligent,

589
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:30,000
I don't have that knowledge, that
ability to speak another man's mind.

590
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,040
He never discussed it to me,

591
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:35,240
and a person's mind
change from time to time.

592
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,520
- The decision is yours...
- It is mine to make

593
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:43,120
and I haven't made any...
I don't have any decisions to make.

594
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,240
Let's get this show
on the road.

595
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,720
This meeting is called to order.
Here, here.

596
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,560
The delay won't have
any effect on the fight at all.

597
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:58,040
There hasn't been...
there will not be a delay.

598
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,200
The fight will be rescheduled

599
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,480
but when it happens it'll be
actually intended for that time.

600
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:07,760
Fate intended it for another time.
There is no delay.

601
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,280
How does
Ali feel about it?

602
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:14,920
If there ever has been
any disappointments in sports,

603
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,680
setbacks or rainy days
that stopped a ball game, anything,

604
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,960
this is the worst of all time.

605
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,040
'Muhammad went through
a bad couple of hours

606
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:29,440
'and wanted to move the whole fight
back to the United States,

607
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,280
'then he said "Bring Joe Frazier
over and I'll fight him again

608
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,520
'"and instead of each of us
getting $5 million,

609
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:41,040
'"I'll take $3 million
and Joe can take $1 million."

610
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:45,000
'Then he realised
nothing could be done about it

611
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:50,080
'except stay in Zaire an extra
six weeks and make the best of it.'

612
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:54,480
Now I gotta wait. He'll get his
whupping but I just have to wait.

613
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:58,640
Boy, I was ready!
I was gonna upset the world again!

614
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:03,320
The whole world was gonna
crawl and bow the next morning!

615
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:07,520
I was gonna defeat that big
indestructible George Foreman,

616
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,280
gonna rip him up!

617
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,160
I'm gonna get him
for a sparring partner.

618
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:16,640
My dream's all messed up
for six more weeks.

619
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,960
The man's in trouble,
the man is scared.

620
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,320
- He's in my country to start with!

621
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:31,560
He's in my country.
You wanna see some of my country?

622
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,680
Ali, boma ye!

623
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:38,120
Ali, boma ye!
Ali, boma ye!

624
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:42,640
Can you picture 100,000?
Can you picture 100,000?

625
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:48,080
How you say it?
Ali, boma ye, Ali, boma ye!

626
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,920
Ali, boma ye!

627
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:53,520
When I hear them brothers
howling like that, whoo!

628
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,440
I get my soul and spirit,

629
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:59,560
100,000 African brothers
hollering "Ali, boma ye!"

630
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,440
And I'm gonna... Ooh!

631
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:05,600
I'm tired, can't take it no more,
let me get out of here.

632
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:09,600
I wanna... I'm going to my room,
I'll talk to you later.

633
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,200
I said I'm gone!

634
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,000
# What you give me

635
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,320
# When I miss you, baby!

636
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,920
# Oh, man!

637
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,520
# Baby, you understand?

638
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,680
# I'll be good!

639
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,920
# In a cold sweat

640
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,080
# Ow!

641
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,960
# Turn it back #

642
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,640
'Black acts in America
have not learned

643
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:58,920
'that once their record
is off the charts they're finished.'

644
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:03,160
I heard a speech by Jesse Jackson,
saying we must recognise

645
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,800
that we're only useful
as long as we're necessary.

646
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:11,680
So they don't realise that your
strength comes from your community.

647
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,560
And you have to deal
from your strength.

648
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:17,920
In dealing from your strength
you got somebody

649
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,920
so if somebody
wants to hurt James Brown,

650
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,000
somebody gonna raise a voice
and say "why?"

651
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:27,400
You got soldiers,
somebody that's concerned.

652
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:32,200
But as an individual, no matter
how big you get, you still a nigger.

653
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:36,520
You don't care how much money
you get. You are still a nigger.

654
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,680
When you become unnecessary.

655
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,160
# Listen

656
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,520
# Extend your love

657
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,480
# Can I get a drum?

658
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:51,080
# Can I get a little taste? #

659
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:55,280
Do unto others as you would have them
to do unto you.

660
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,400
Would you ask somebody to lynch you

661
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:02,440
and tell you where to go and how
to look, then refuse to pay you?

662
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,400
Would you ask somebody
to take advantage of your woman

663
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,520
and you can't even speak to his?

664
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:11,560
Would you like to pay taxes for
something that you never received?

665
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:15,000
Do unto others as you would have
somebody do unto you.

666
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,400
And I don't have to use
the word "FM" backwards.

667
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,320
We left Africa in shackles,
fetters and chains.

668
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:31,040
We're coming back
in an aura of splendour and glory.

669
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:36,240
The champions are here, champions of
the sports world and the music world,

670
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:40,480
so put 'em together and we got
one champion that's so intermingled

671
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,920
that we're fused into one entity.

672
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,640
The brother said something there!
Yeah!

673
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,600
Don King put this together.

674
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:52,040
It was not a colour put it together,
you understand?

675
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:54,160
I'd like to call him the Messiah.

676
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:57,200
'This fight
came into existence

677
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:01,080
'because of Don King's
desire to break out of the pack.

678
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:06,600
'He was either going to become an
enormously prominent man, at least,

679
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,920
'or go back to obscurity again
if it failed.'

680
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,720
Oh, I'm so happy
to see you, my brothers.

681
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:15,720
This is the Minister of Finance
of Zaire.

682
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,520
Yes, I have met
the Minister of Finance. How are you?

683
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:22,560
I appreciate your talent
and expertise.

684
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:26,240
This is what it's all about.
I welcome you with love.

685
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:30,640
We must deal with it as such,
but with love, not with hostility.

686
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:33,040
You know, just but with love.

687
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,920
Bravo, Mr King!

688
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,640
My brother!

689
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:40,200
'King had
this huge air of welcome.

690
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:44,400
'Rarely has anyone ever been welcomed
the way King could do it.'

691
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,320
'A joy came off him.'

692
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:49,840
I knew his reputation,
how he'd been in jail,

693
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:52,400
how he was thoroughly untrustworthy

694
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:55,200
but nonetheless
he made you feel good.

695
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,680
Don't leave! I need your strength!

696
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,600
He was startling looking.

697
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:04,040
Writers found different ways
to describe this uprush of hair.

698
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:07,840
Some would say that he'd stuck
his thumb into an electric socket.

699
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:10,400
Falling through an elevator shaft.

700
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,720
'The fight was postponed.

701
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:17,520
'Don King turned up and it seemed
maybe the fight wouldn't happen.'

702
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:20,040
Nothing as big as this
ever runs smoothly,

703
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,680
anything worthwhile
is worth fighting for.

704
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,720
If you think
about what Shakespeare said,

705
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,840
"the sweet uses of adversity,

706
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:32,800
"ugly and venomous like a toad yet
wears a precious jewel in his head."

707
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:37,080
"Ugly and venomous like a toad
yet wears a precious jewel."

708
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:40,960
How many fight promoters have tried
even one line of Shakespeare?

709
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,680
I can relate to the denial
they are confronted with,

710
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:50,240
the rat-infested hovels, sub-standard
tenements, overcrowded tenements.

711
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:54,480
I've been a part of it.
I know about roaches and rats.

712
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,600
When he started talkin' to me

713
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,080
I can understand him
and he can understand me.

714
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:02,040
So, when I do this here
he can understand.

715
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,960
Now he will believe in me

716
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,080
because he feels
that I have shared with him

717
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:11,040
the same anguish and anxiety,
the same pain that he has felt.

718
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:12,800
It's a big difference.

719
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:15,720
What would happen
if you took a small part

720
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:19,280
of the vast sums of money
being made from the fight

721
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:21,920
and put it into something that was...

722
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:25,520
that would help a number of people
rather than a few?

723
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:27,760
This is my dream and desire,

724
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:33,440
and I feel that I would need...
white counterparts to do this here.

725
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:38,560
I would say let me engender a large
amount of money, if it's possible,

726
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:43,200
and then don't just let the money
sit there and wither away and die

727
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:47,880
but put it into the sun so it could
germinate, blossom and grow.

728
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,360
'He's a remarkable man.

729
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,400
'Don King is one of
the brightest people I've ever met,

730
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:58,400
'he's one of the most
charismatic people I've ever met,

731
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:02,720
'he's one of the hardest working
people I've ever met.'

732
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:05,840
He is also totally amoral

733
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:12,320
and I can't think of a man who has
done more to demoralise fighters,

734
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:18,000
exploit from fighters and ruin
fighters' careers than Don King.

735
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,160
But you have to give him his due

736
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:24,960
for what he did to make Muhammad Ali
versus George Foreman in Zaire.

737
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,160
And nobody does anything for nothing.

738
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,480
You understand that?

739
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:33,520
Fight or no fight,
what business are we in?

740
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:35,960
- Music!
- I was starting to wonder.

741
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,840
I felt like
we've been in the fight business.

742
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,040
# My body

743
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:14,240
# My body

# We're gonna have a funky good time

759
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,440
# Pick 'em up!

# We're gonna take you high, yeah! #

761
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,600
I'm gonna play me
some soul music, man.

762
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:40,640
The Spinners...to James Brown.

763
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,240
- # Make me high
- # Get me high

764
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,440
- # Make me high
- # Get me high

765
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:48,880
- # A natural high
- # Groovy high... #

766
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:51,760
Ali! Ali!

767
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:54,200
# Downright high

768
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,600
- # Everybody high
- # Legal high

769
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,480
# Need to get high

770
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:01,320
- # Down high... #
- I'm ready.

771
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:03,440
- # Bad!
- # Bad!

772
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,280

- # Bad!
- # Bad! #

779
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,600
Sucker, you ain't nothin'!

780
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,320
You're too ugly!

781
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:11,200
You don't represent
us coloured folks.

782
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:13,840
These Africans make all of us ugly.

783
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:16,560
Sucker, look at you!

784
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,680
You out, sucker.

785
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:26,080
Ali, boma ye!

786
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,280
Ali, boma ye!

787
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,440
Ali, boma ye!

788
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,880
Ali, boma ye!

789
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,680
That mean kill him!

790
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:38,600
When I walk
down the street kids follow me

791
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,440
screaming "George Foreman, bumba yu"

792
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:43,360
er, "boma ye", yeah.

793
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:46,800
And that hasn't...
I don't think that's so nice.

794
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:51,000
I'd like, if they have anything
to say about me they could say

795
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:55,840
"George Foreman loves Africa"
or "George Foreman loves being here"

796
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:59,400
not "George Foreman, kill him,"
I don't like that.

797
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,760
Boma ye!
Boma ye!

798
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:06,160
George Foreman.
Boma ye! Boma ye!

799
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,600
- There he is!
- Boma ye!

800
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,680
Sucker, you wasn't nothing!

801
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,880
Even they understand English.

802
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:21,720
'We were all for Muhammad Ali.

803
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,480
'Foreman? We didn't know him.

804
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,800
'Foreman said "Why?

805
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:32,760
'"I'm black,
blacker than Muhammad Ali.

806
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,880
'"Why all this bias?"

807
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:39,200
'Yes, Muhammad Ali, he was lighter,

808
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:42,720
'but he was a real person,
he was genuine.

809
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:46,640
'Muhammad Ali could have been
even lighter-skinned

810
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:49,880
'but for us
he was defending the good cause,

811
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,680
'for Africans and the whole world.'

812
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,560
Watch this, seven punches.

813
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,160
I'm gonna fight for the prestige,

814
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:01,240
not for me
but to uplift my little brothers

815
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:05,120
who are sleeping
on concrete floors today in America.

816
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:08,520
Black people living on welfare,
who can't eat,

817
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:13,760
Black people who don't know no
knowledge of themselves or no future.

818
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:18,400
I wanna win my title and walk down
the alleys with the wine-heads,

819
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:21,800
walk with the dope addicts,
the prostitutes.

820
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:26,160
I could help people, show 'em films,
take this documentary,

821
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:29,760
and help uplift my people
in Louisville, Kentucky;

822
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,960
Indianapolis, Indiana;
Cincinnati, Ohio;

823
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,400
go through Tennessee, Florida
and Mississippi

824
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:40,920
and show Black Africans who didn't
know this was their country,

825
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:44,640
"You look like your brothers
in Alabama, in Georgia.

826
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:47,080
"They never knew you was over here."

827
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:49,960
God is blessing me
and it was an accident

828
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,080
to help get to all these people

829
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:56,800
and show them films I haven't seen!
I'm well and I haven't seem them!

830
00:55:56,840 --> 00:56:01,680
Now I can get all these films, you
governments can let me take pictures

831
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:05,040
and I can take
all this back to America!

832
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:09,680
But - it's good to be a winner,
all I've got to do is whup Foreman.

833
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:13,400
I realise how unfortunate
and uncomfortable it is

834
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,000
for you guys to have travelled so far

835
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,040
and expecting so much

836
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:20,120
and getting so little.

837
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,760
'George Foreman
was a phenomenon.

838
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,280
'He was almost like a physical guru.

839
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:29,000
'He almost never spoke
but it was always arresting.

840
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:34,120
'You never quite knew what he meant,
it might be deep or non-responsive.

841
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:38,000
'He was Negritude.
He was this huge Black force.'

842
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:42,120
Because of this I had expected
Muhammad Ali to be here today.

843
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:46,880
I was gonna hit him in his mouth
to give you some entertainment.

844
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:51,000
Now when I go in the ring,
you see what kind of mind I got now?

845
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:54,200
Oh! Oh!

846
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,320
I just got to pound him.

847
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:58,240
I'm not gonna even realise...

848
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:01,680
I might look at his face
and say, "How'd I do that?"

849
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:06,560
Allah, God, I'm his tool. God got
in me on purpose for my people.

850
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:09,840
God has made this man
look like a little kid.

851
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:14,520
His so-called right hand ain't
nothing now, I don't even feel 'em!

852
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:18,760
I walk right in and take my shots
because I have God in my mind.

853
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:23,640
I'm thinking of my people being free
and I can help with just one fight.

854
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:27,760
He looks little in comparison
to what I'm getting from it!

855
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:30,400
But if I think about just me...

856
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:33,960
George Foreman knocked out
Joe Frazier like he was God.

857
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,080
He knocked out Ken Norton.

858
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:39,040
And the white press,
the power structure

859
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,400
rank me to get tired in five or six,

860
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:45,520
then I go in like Norton
and the rest of them and get scared.

861
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:47,080
But my God controls the universe.

862
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:01,600
'I was interested
in people called "fticheurs".

863
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,360
'They are witches, soothsayers,

864
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,200
'and in Western Africa
almost everybody has one.

865
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:09,920
'They go to a witch doctor
the way we would go to a dentist.'

866
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:16,280
Muhammad Ali had been
to Mobutu's fticheur.

867
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,440
And...

868
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:23,600
He had said that...

869
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:27,680
The fticheur had said
that a woman with trembling hands

870
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:30,160
would somehow get to Foreman.

871
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,080
A succubus.

872
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:34,760
'And that impressed me enormously.'

873
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:44,800
'The heavyweight
championship produces an excitement

874
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:48,000
'that's unlike
almost any other spectacle.

875
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:50,720
'It's almost physically unendurable

876
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:54,240
'to wait for that bell
to ring for the first round.

877
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:58,080
'In 1974 in Zaire, the fight started
at four in the morning,

878
00:59:58,120 --> 01:00:01,400
'in order that it could be shown
on TV in America

879
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,720
'at a reasonable hour like 10.'

880
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:06,400
Boma ye! Boma ye!

881
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:10,960
'Before the fight,
I saw a scene that was incomparable.

882
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,920
'Ali's dressing room
was like a morgue.'

883
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:16,040
It was like The Last Supper.

884
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:19,760
And at a certain point Ali said,

885
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:22,760
"Why is everyone...

886
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,080
"so unhappy?

887
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:28,680
"What is the matter with all of you?"

888
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:34,200
The sense was that we were watching
a man who was going out to be...

889
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:36,440
going out to the gallows.

890
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:41,120
They all believed he was gonna get
defeated and they were terrified.

891
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:43,520
They thought that with his pride

892
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:46,680
he would take one of the world's
worst beatings ever

893
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:48,520
and he wouldn't give up.

894
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:52,400
And he was gonna be destroyed.
Killed or maimed, they knew not what.

895
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,760
But they were deeply frightened,

896
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:59,720
as if they were taking whatever fear
Ali might have had and absorbing it.

897
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,280
After a while he looked at Bundini

898
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:05,200
and said,
"We're gonna dance tonight."

899
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:08,600
They said, "You're gonna dance!"

900
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:12,200
Muhammad Ali was so funny
repeating this.

901
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:15,240
"What am I gonna do?!"
They said, "Dance!"

902
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:19,240
He said, "Yes!
And that man's gonna be bewildered!

903
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,520
"I'm gonna dance and dance!"

904
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:25,720
And they said, "You're gonna dance!"
I swear they were all crying.

905
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,800
And he built them up to a degree

906
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:31,000
so that for him
they became half-happy.

907
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:36,040
Here comes the
Ali people out of the dressing room

908
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:39,120
and all of the questions
will be answered.

909
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:41,720
The awesome power of George Foreman

910
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:45,400
against the varied boxing skills
of Muhammad Ali.

911
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,960
It's age against youth.

912
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,200
The experience of Muhammad Ali

913
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:54,160
against the youth and brute force
and blinding speed.

914
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:56,920
You can hear the band strike up
in the background

915
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:59,040
as Ali moves to the ring.

916
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:03,160
This is what Muhammad Ali lives for,
this is the man's life.

917
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,440
This may be an historic event,

918
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:09,680
Muhammad Ali coming into
the boxing ring for the last time.

919
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:11,720
Should Muhammad Ali retire,

920
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:15,520
this will be, what you're seeing now,
a very historic event.

921
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:19,800
Here comes the heavyweight champion
of the world, George Foreman,

922
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:21,920
jogging out!

923
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:25,080
George Foreman
decked out in his red robes,

924
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:27,240
coming in with his people.

925
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:30,760
'No one in the press
ever saw Mobutu

926
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:33,160
'and he didn't come to the fight.

927
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:36,160
'He watched the fight
on closed circuit.

928
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:38,240
'It was the only one in Zaire.

929
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:41,320
'He was terribly afraid
of assassination.

930
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:44,720
'This stadium
was a true arena for gladiators.

931
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:50,240
'The floor you could not see beneath
the floor was covered with blood.

932
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:54,880
'That blood had been washed away
but the effect was still there.'

933
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:58,480
There was talk
about the possibility of rain,

934
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:02,160
I don't think the weather could be
any more beautiful than it is.

935
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,880
Ali is getting the people to chant!

936
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:08,000
"Ali, boma ye,"
that means "Ali, kill him."

937
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:13,240
'The atmosphere before
the bell rang for that first round

938
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:16,640
'was as intense
as any I ever recall.'

939
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:21,800
As they stare, Muhammad
Ali talking to George Foreman.

940
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,960
Really staring at each other.

941
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,640
Foreman looking serious,
Ali definitely talking.

942
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:31,440
Look at the stare on Foreman.
Look at Ali give him the word.

943
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:35,280
The stage is set, we're just about
ready to begin round one.

944
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:37,480
The championship is at stake

945
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:40,880
and $5 million will be paid
to both fighters.

946
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:44,960
Ali ready, Foreman ready,
we're waiting for the bell.

947
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:49,480
Here we go,
Ali quickly across the ring.

948
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:53,600
Round one, Ali bouncing around,
shifting left to right.

949
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:57,000
George moves slow,
Ali gets the first punch in,

950
01:03:57,040 --> 01:04:01,240
a light right-hand taken
on the forehead by the champion.

951
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:03,760
Foreman moving slow, stalking.

952
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:07,080
Ali looks like he's ready to go here.

953
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:10,320
He's not staying away,
he's going after his man.

954
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:15,040
Foreman cautious in the first round,
looking to drop that left hook.

955
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:22,600
Foreman's locked his man
to the far corner.

956
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:26,600
There's that left upper-cut
into the body of Muhammad Ali.

957
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:30,120
Ali tries to hang on
to the head of George Foreman.

958
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:33,440
Foreman dances...
Ali with a right-hand lead!

959
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:37,120
Has Foreman slightly confused
with that right-hand lead,

960
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:40,000
which I haven't seen
too many times before.

961
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:44,320
A right-hand lead, where you throw
your right without countering,

962
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:47,080
you throw it first, like a jab.

963
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:51,400
That has to travel that extra
distance across the shoulders.

964
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:56,240
'Professionals rarely use this
because it's so dangerous to throw

965
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:58,640
'since you are open to a left hook.

966
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:01,600
'Since fighters work in milliseconds

967
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:05,400
'they can see a right coming
much faster than a jab.'

968
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:08,720
Nobody had thrown a right-hand lead
at Foreman in two years,

969
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:11,920
and none of his sparring partners,
for $50 a day,

970
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:15,600
was going to start
throwing right-hand leads at him

971
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:19,200
because it's a great insult
to a top professional.

972
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:23,200
'It suggests he's slow enough
that you can hit him with it.'

973
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:28,160
'Instead Ali figured out Foreman's
not expecting a right-hand lead.

974
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:31,880
'"I'm gonna hit him with a right hand
and knock him out."

975
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:36,840
'Ali threw 12 right hand leads, he
hadn't told anybody he was going to.'

976
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:40,800
He may have debated whether to
up until the last moment.

977
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:44,320
But he didn't knock Foreman down
or knock him out.

978
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:46,400
Instead, Foreman went crazy.

979
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:50,280
That punch
did no damage. That one did!

980
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:53,520
Two wild right hands
taken on the head of Ali!

981
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:56,920
A real strong right hand
just underneath the heart.

982
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:59,720
Ali is taking some punishment now!

983
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:02,040
Eight seconds left in the round.

984
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:04,160
Bell rang.

985
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:07,120
Ali went back to the corner...

986
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:11,520
Finally the nightmare
he'd been awaiting in the ring

987
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:13,800
had finally come to visit him.

988
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:17,560
'He was in the ring
with a man he could not dominate,

989
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:21,360
'who was stronger than him,
who was not afraid of him,

990
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:25,480
'who'd try to knock him out,
and who punched harder than Ali,

991
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:29,520
'and this man was determined
and unstoppable.

992
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:32,280
'Ali had a look on his face
that I'll never forget.

993
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:35,360
'It was the only time
I ever saw fear in Ali's eyes.'

994
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:38,720
Ali looked as if
he looked into himself and said,

995
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:41,000
"All right, this is the moment.

996
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:43,800
"This is what
you've been waiting for.

997
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:46,680
"This is...that hour.

998
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:50,760
"Do you have the guts?"
And he kind of nodded,

999
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:53,760
like, "Really got
to get it together, boy.

1000
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:58,000
"You are gonna get it together...
you WILL get it together."

1001
01:06:58,040 --> 01:07:02,720
He nodded some more, as if he were
looking into the eyes of his maker,

1002
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:06,800
and then turned to the crowd
and went "Ali, boma ye!"

1003
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:10,880
and 100,000 people
all yelled back "Ali, boma ye!"

1004
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:15,960
And this huge reverberation
of the crowd came back into the ring.

1005
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,240
'Ali picked it up as if
"these are my people,

1006
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,320
'"this is what I'm here for.

1007
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:25,680
'"The time has come, I'm gonna find
a way to master this man."'

1008
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:28,320
Ali tries
to tie him up.

1009
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:31,040
No real damage done in that exchange.

1010
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:35,920
'Foreman, like everyone,
had assumed that Ali would dance,

1011
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:41,200
'and so Ali now went to the ropes
and went into the Rope-a-Dope.

1012
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:46,160
'And a lot of people thought
that moment the fight was over.

1013
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:50,720
'Especially on TV, it looked like
Foreman was killing a very weak Ali.'

1014
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:52,640
You don't go to the ropes.

1015
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:55,800
And there he was, leaning way back.

1016
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:58,920
'I wrote about it, like a man
leaning out of his window

1017
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:01,920
'trying to see
if there's something on his roof.'

1018
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:03,840
And, you know, taking it.

1019
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:06,120
Here were these great broadsides

1020
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:09,760
and it looked like
he was being set up for the kill.

1021
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:12,360
It happened so quickly
and so abruptly,

1022
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:17,080
that I said, I shouted to Norman,
"The fix is in."

1023
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:19,760
'He's supposed to go down
in the first or second.

1024
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:22,360
'Ropes is halfway house
to the floor.'

1025
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:25,120
'It just looked as though
he had to cave in.'

1026
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:30,280
..some awkward but
very powerful hooks with both hands.

1027
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:34,280
'They became so basic that
they were like two kids fighting.'

1028
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:39,200
'For that round and the next round
and the next round

1029
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:43,000
'Ali lay against the ropes,
and he kept talking to Foreman.

1030
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,720
'It was extraordinary.

1031
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:47,520
'You had to be close to see it.'

1032
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:51,320
'And Foreman was throwing
these prodigious punches

1033
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:54,240
'and Ali swung
like a man in the rigging.'

1034
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:57,080
He'd go all the way back,
he'd slide out like that.

1035
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:00,640
Occasionally, he'd get hit and he'd
say "George, you disappoint me.

1036
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:04,960
"You don't hit as hard
as I thought you would, George,

1037
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,520
"you're not breaking popcorn!"

1038
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,880
'And Foreman's insane with rage,

1039
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:12,760
'wanging at him and wanging at him,

1040
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:15,360
'powerful, powerful, powerful.

1041
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:19,280
'And middle of the fifth round
Foreman had punched himself out.

1042
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:21,360
'It had taken three rounds.'

1043
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:25,960
Ali picks it up,
40 seconds left in round five.

1044
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:34,960
First good combination by Ali
lands on the head of Foreman.

1045
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,520
Foreman with that right hook.

1046
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:39,560
Ali scores a hook!

1047
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,680
Quick jab with the right
backs up Foreman!

1048
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,680
Backs him up in his tracks!

1049
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:48,280
Foreman tries the hook!
Ali goes to the right!

1050
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:50,640
Foreman gets knocked to the left!

1051
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:53,840
Foreman hit again!

1052
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:57,920
Foreman has been hit
three or four times!

1053
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:00,400
Ali came off the ropes
and hit him a right

1054
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:04,640
and you can see the sweat pour off
like a fountain off Foreman's face

1055
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:08,920
and you suddenly realised
there was design in this madness.

1056
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:12,360
So I turned to Norman,
he was somewhat puzzled,

1057
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:15,080
but I said,
"The succubus has got him!",

1058
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:18,120
referring to this woman
with the trembling hands

1059
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:22,080
that the witch doctors had said
would touch Foreman and destroy him.

1060
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:28,720
..Ali's tactics,
to let the man punch himself out.

1061
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:31,120
30 seconds left in round eight.

1062
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:36,080
Very even fight.

1063
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:38,400
Ali a sneaky right hand.

1064
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:41,120
Another sneaky right hand.

1065
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:43,680
Works over the shoulder of Foreman.

1066
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:45,560
There's the combination!

1067
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,440
Two...three...

1068
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:53,160
Four...five...

1069
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:56,720
Foreman gets up to the knee at eight!

1070
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:00,240
That's it! The fight is stopped!

1071
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:03,760
Muhammad Ali with
a dramatic eighth round knockout!

1072
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:07,600
He knocks out...George Foreman!

1073
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:10,600
He's done it! Muhammad Ali
has done it! Muhammad Ali has...

1074
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:15,160
Muhammad Ali. Muhammad Ali...

1075
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:19,600
'Muhammad Ali,
he was like a sleeping elephant.

1076
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:23,880
'You can do whatever you want
around a sleeping elephant,

1077
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:29,600
'but when he wakes up...
he tramples everything.'

1078
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:35,840
Muhammad Ali, boma ye.

1079
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:40,720
Boma ye. Muhammad Ali,
boma ye George Foreman.

1080
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:42,760
He did it.

1081
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:46,280
'He's champion again,
we couldn't believe it.

1082
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:49,720
'It was such a classic performance
and so beautiful

1083
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:53,440
'that at the moment
Ali hit the knockout punch,

1084
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:57,200
'Foreman began to go,
Ali followed him around,

1085
01:11:57,240 --> 01:12:00,400
'Ali had his right cocked
for one more punch

1086
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:02,040
'but he never threw it,

1087
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:07,000
'as though he didn't want to ruin the
aesthetic of this man going down.'

1088
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:11,320
One has mixed emotions
when you see the end of a fight.

1089
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:14,520
'I always feel sympathy
for the man losing it,

1090
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:18,640
'particularly when you see
a titanic, formidable figure

1091
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:20,640
'suddenly on the ground.'

1092
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:23,360
'Now,
when we see George on TV,

1093
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:26,080
'and know that after that knockout

1094
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:29,960
'he went through two years
of the deepest depression,

1095
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,400
'he almost didn't come out of it.

1096
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:35,280
'To see the man who's come out of it,

1097
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:38,680
'the way he reconstructed
his personality,

1098
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:44,080
'it's hard to find anyone in America
more affable than George Foreman.

1099
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:48,200
'Foreman has become
a fabulous person in American life.'

1100
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:50,320
Just as the fight finished,

1101
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:54,520
the monsoons, the African rains,
came, and they came so hard

1102
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:58,720
that the waters were about
three feet deep in the dressing rooms

1103
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:02,320
where we'd just been an hour ago,
I'd never seen such a downpour.

1104
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:05,480
And we rode back
through the African night

1105
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,960
from the boxing ring into Kinshasa

1106
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,320
and there were crowds on the roads
standing in the pouring rain

1107
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:16,680
leaping up and down because
news had got around that Ali had won.

1108
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:20,960
'He stayed up all night
from what I heard,

1109
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:25,720
'and in the morning he spoke to
African groups who'd come to see him,

1110
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:28,800
'and they more than revered him,
he was a god.

1111
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:32,720
'And he spoke to them
very simply and beautifully,

1112
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:36,640
'and he said,
"Afro-Americans, in America,

1113
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:38,720
'"we're not as good as you are.

1114
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:41,200
'"Some of us are richer than you are,

1115
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:45,160
'"but you have a dignity
in your poverty that we don't have.

1116
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:47,080
'"We are spoiled in America,

1117
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:51,280
'"we have lost what you still have
in Africa and you must keep that."

1118
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:55,480
'And I thought, on top of everything
else he's a political leader

1119
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:57,800
'and he's gonna be
a great political leader.'

1120
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:03,040
I have a lot of things to do
in the Black neighbourhoods,

1121
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:07,160
we have a lot of problems
we have to solve among ourselves.

1122
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:09,640
Prostitution, dope, gang fights.

1123
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:13,680
Knowledge of self. Black people
have no knowledge of themselves.

1124
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:16,440
We have been made
just like white people mentally.

1125
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:19,240
White people have made us
so much like them

1126
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:22,040
it's hard to teach them
about themselves,

1127
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:26,520
it's hard to teach them to unite
and marry and be with their own.

1128
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:29,160
Black people
are now like white people,

1129
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:31,440
we have to re-brainwash 'em now,

1130
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:35,840
teach them about themselves
and their history and language,

1131
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:38,040
to do something for themselves

1132
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:42,520
and quit begging white people
for things they should do themselves.

1133
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:46,000
I never heard Ali say
he would never fight again.

1134
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:48,840
If he had said it,
and usually he told the truth,

1135
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:50,920
I wouldn't have believed it.

1136
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:54,760
He was born to fight,
born for the ring and loved it,

1137
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:56,720
he truly loved fighting.

1138
01:14:56,760 --> 01:15:01,840
And...as happens with people who love
a thing too much, it destroys them.

1139
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:05,400
It was Oscar Wilde that said
you destroy the thing you love.

1140
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:09,280
It's the other way round,
what you love destroys you.

1141
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:17,640
'He came back,
he had 22 fights.

1142
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:20,600
'Some were most honourable,
some very difficult.

1143
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:23,160
'Some were comedies and farces.

1144
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:27,880
'He hurt himself in those 22 fights
after the fight in Africa.'

1145
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:35,600
'There is a tendency
to look at Muhammad and say

1146
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:37,640
'he's wounded, he's ill.

1147
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:42,240
'There are no intellectual deficits,
it's a motor skills problem

1148
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:45,280
'and he doesn't try
to hide his condition.

1149
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:48,000
'He goes out and lets
the whole world see it.

1150
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:50,520
'He doesn't feel sorry for himself

1151
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:55,320
'and there's really no reason for
anybody else to feel sorry for him.

1152
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:57,720
'He loves being Muhammad Ali,

1153
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:01,360
'he truly believes
that he's doing God's work

1154
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:05,000
'and he's as happy with each day
as anybody I know.'

1155
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:10,040
'Today's young generation,
they don't know anything.'

1156
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:15,080
Something happened last year,
they know nothing about it.

1157
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:19,640
So there are these great great
stories, great historic events,

1158
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:22,680
and I'm not talking
about 1850s stuff,

1159
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:26,800
they don't know who Malcolm X is,
they don't know who JFK is,

1160
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:30,600
Muhammad Ali, Jackie Robinson,
you can go down the line.

1161
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:32,520
And it's scary.

1162
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:37,320
'They're missing a lot if they don't
know the legacy of Muhammad Ali,

1163
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:40,280
'because no matter
what era you live in,

1164
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:42,520
'you see very few true heroes.'

1165
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:49,400
Ali, boma ye!

1166
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:54,320
Ali, boma ye! Ali, boma ye!
Ali, boma ye!

1167
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:58,440
Back up, sucker, back up.

1168
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:01,800
Come get me, sucker, I'm dancin'!

1169
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:04,000
I'm dancin'! Follow me, chump!

1170
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:06,160
I'm not there, I'm here!

1171
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:10,320
Sucker, you ain't got nothing!

# In every heart

1173
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:24,960
# There is a drum that beats

1174
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,040
# Steady and strong

1175
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:30,720
# It does not know defeat

1176
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:33,360

Years after the fight in Zaire,
perhaps ten years after,

1216
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:21,960
I'd run into Ali on occasion after
that, but I remember this meeting.

1217
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,280
Esquire was giving a party
for various people

1218
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:29,360
who had distinguished themselves
in Esquire that year.

1219
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:31,480
Ali, for whatever he'd done,

1220
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:35,720
I was there probably because I had
a good story in Esquire that year,

1221
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:38,520
maybe 25 of us, honoured guests,

1222
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:41,200
I was there with my wife
and we saw Ali

1223
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:43,240
and we were talking with him

1224
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:45,760
and he couldn't have been nicer.

1225
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:49,080
I remember I was 62 then,
cos he said, "How old are you now?"

1226
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:54,120
I said "62," he said "Oh," same as
when we were jogging that night,

1227
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:59,120
"Oh, I hope I'm as young as you are
when I'm 62," he went on like that.

1228
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:03,320
I got so pleased and so vain that,
you know, I'm like a dog.

1229
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:07,160
What did I have to do?
I had to go urinate, and I did.

1230
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:10,720
I went away and once I was gone
he turned to my wife,

1231
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:14,960
who's much younger than I am,
and he looked at her hard and said,

1232
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,640
"You still with that old man?"

1233
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:22,800
And for me that's always been...
That's Ali.

1234
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:27,240
You love him even when
you turn your back on him.

1235
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:32,400
I heard him once talking to the
Harvard senior class commencement.

1236
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:38,160
He gave this extraordinary speech,
you know he was dyslexic,

1237
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:40,600
and he would look
at a paper and say,

1238
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:44,080
"What does this word mean?"
I'd say, "Appendicitis."

1239
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:48,600
He'd say, "How d'you get a word
like appendicitis? It's so long."

1240
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:51,000
Here he was delivering a lecture,

1241
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:56,400
senior class day with these
1,000, 2,000 Harvard graduates,

1242
01:21:56,440 --> 01:22:00,000
and...he had these little cards
in front of him.

1243
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:05,000
He gave this wonderful speech
about he hadn't had the opportunity

1244
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:09,800
but they had and they should use that
to make the world a better place.

1245
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:14,560
It was moving and funny, and a great
roar of appreciation at the end.

1246
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:17,600
Then someone shouted out,
"Give us a poem!"

1247
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:20,440
And everybody quieted down.

1248
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:25,600
Now, the shortest poem according
to Bartlett's Quotations is called

1249
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:27,800
"On the Antiquity of Microbes"

1250
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:30,280
and the poem is "Adam had 'em."

1251
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:32,040
Pretty short.

1252
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:34,440
But Muhammad Ali's poem was

1253
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:37,720
"Me, we."

1254
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:40,160
Two words.

1255
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:44,840
I wrote Bartlett's Quotations
and I said, "Look, that's shorter."

1256
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:48,480
It stands for something more
than the poem itself.

1257
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:50,960
"Me, we." What a fighter he was.
And what a man.

1258
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:59,760
# Refugee cat... Ali, boma ye

1259
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:03,080
# Yes, yes... Rumble in the jungle

1260
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:10,440
# Come on!

1261
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:12,880
# Root to the fruit
more bass than Bootsy Collins

1262
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:15,680
# You versus me
that's like Ali versus Foreman

1263
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:18,600
# God's act, stand back and watch

1264
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:21,600
# Devil's time-out
can't be timed with no Swatch watch

1265
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:24,000
# Who I am, the Black Abraham

1266
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:26,840
# Zunga zunga zang

1267
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:29,240
# Add an extra bar
as I spar with literature

1268
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:30,640
# Taking kingdoms from Tsars

1269
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:32,280
# Winning more wars than the Moors

1270
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:34,920
# Hey, what's the deal?
I seen the Devil spar with Allah

1271
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:37,640
# Mathematics was the key
to set my whole race free

1272
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:40,400
# You might debate we,
a refugee no harm hurt me

1273
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:43,240
# Dying, thirsty from the struggle
to my own hustle bubble

1274
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:45,960
# On the low, woe is me
to show the Free Bob right

1275
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,400
# The righteous Asiatic thinker

1276
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:48,880

01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:50,360
# Civilised like the Molly

1278
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:51,760
# Burgundy, wildly rocking

1279
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:53,320
# Seen the fifth when Ali clocked him

1280
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:54,800
# John Forte will keep you locked in

1281
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:57,320
# People all around
you got to recognise and witness

1282
01:23:57,360 --> 01:24:00,160
# The Mister who swift enough
to knock you out with mic fitness

1283
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:01,480
# Hands blistered
from holding the mic tight

1284
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:02,760
# Some say it's fight night

1285
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:05,880
# Well, throw the R after the F
cos I'm gonna take away your breath

1286
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:08,560
# The bell rings

1287
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:11,400

1288
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:13,920

1291
