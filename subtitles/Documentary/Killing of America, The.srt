1
00:00:32,739 --> 00:00:34,104
Cambodia.

2
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:37,965
To many Westerners,
it seemed a paradise.

3
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,213
Another world, a secret world.

4
00:00:41,378 --> 00:00:45,314
But the war in neighboring
Vietnam burst its borders...

5
00:00:45,346 --> 00:00:48,873
...and the fighting soon spread
to neutral Cambodia.

6
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:52,830
In 1973, I went to cover
this sideshow struggle...

7
00:00:52,896 --> 00:00:55,990
...as foreign correspondent
of The New York Times.

8
00:00:56,225 --> 00:00:58,989
It was there, amidst the fighting...

9
00:00:59,072 --> 00:01:02,405
...between government troops
and the Khmer Rouge guerrillas...

10
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:06,058
...that I met my guide
and interpreter, Dith Pran...

11
00:01:06,111 --> 00:01:09,103
...a man who was to change my life...

12
00:01:09,182 --> 00:01:12,151
...in a country that I grew to love
and pity.

13
00:01:20,861 --> 00:01:23,659
So here we go
with Voice of America...

14
00:01:23,741 --> 00:01:25,732
...news for Southeast Asia.

15
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:29,982
It's 6:45 and a partly cloudy
morning here.

16
00:01:30,012 --> 00:01:32,276
Clouds too in Washington.

17
00:01:32,379 --> 00:01:36,145
President Nixon announced he'll
address the nation on Watergate...

18
00:01:36,187 --> 00:01:38,052
...within the next few days.

19
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,798
The speech will be Nixon's
first since May.

20
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:46,485
The scandal has caused resignations
and paralyzed the White House staff.

21
00:01:46,521 --> 00:01:50,116
It has also led to intense
confrontation and perhaps...

22
00:01:50,169 --> 00:01:53,036
...a constitutional crisis
with Senate investigators...

23
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,741
...and a special
Watergate prosecutor.

24
00:01:55,832 --> 00:01:59,199
The speech was announced
after the Gallup Poll disclosed...

25
00:01:59,256 --> 00:02:03,124
...that Mr. Nixon's popularity
had fallen to the lowest point...

26
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:05,957
...for an American President
in 20 years.

27
00:02:17,173 --> 00:02:19,937
A Supreme Court judge,
William O. Douglas...

28
00:02:20,021 --> 00:02:22,990
...has ruled against an appeal
by the Administration...

29
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:24,722
...for a stay of the injunction...

30
00:02:24,852 --> 00:02:28,344
...on further U.S. Bombing
missions in Cambodia.

31
00:02:28,404 --> 00:02:31,396
Congress has already ruled
these bombings illegal...

32
00:02:31,475 --> 00:02:35,741
...and they should cease in one
week's time on August the 15th.

33
00:02:56,144 --> 00:02:58,135
Let's go, Sarun!
To the hospital!

34
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:18,364
Information. Information.

35
00:03:18,477 --> 00:03:23,414
Air Cambodia regret delays of arrival
of flight number 125...

36
00:03:23,404 --> 00:03:27,033
...from Bangkok because
of bad weather.

37
00:03:47,433 --> 00:03:49,560
Mister, you want taxi?

38
00:03:49,672 --> 00:03:51,936
Mister, you want taxi?
Good taxi.

39
00:04:18,245 --> 00:04:21,305
Shut the fucking blinds, will you?

40
00:04:25,412 --> 00:04:27,073
What's all this shit?

41
00:04:29,924 --> 00:04:31,323
I'm sorry.

42
00:04:32,035 --> 00:04:35,402
I thought you were the houseboy.
I was developing some film.

43
00:04:35,746 --> 00:04:39,307
If you're gonna yell, I'll come back.
I'm not feeling good.

44
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,796
Don't want to yell.
I want to be in a good mood.

45
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,825
The plane was late, no car.
I had to take a taxi here.

46
00:04:44,897 --> 00:04:47,263
All I want to do is work.
I got you.

47
00:04:56,736 --> 00:04:59,068
What the fuck is that on your head?

48
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:04,867
It's a sanitary napkin.
I had it soaked in ice.

49
00:05:06,302 --> 00:05:08,964
Syd Schanberg.
Is Pran there?

50
00:05:10,653 --> 00:05:12,780
No, I just came from the airport.

51
00:05:13,597 --> 00:05:16,589
Well, if he comes in,
would you tell him I'm here?

52
00:05:16,797 --> 00:05:19,288
I'll be at the Café Central, tell him.

53
00:05:19,644 --> 00:05:20,633
Thanks a lot.

54
00:05:37,723 --> 00:05:38,917
What do you want to eat?

55
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:41,754
Want some eggs?

56
00:05:41,914 --> 00:05:45,441
I can't. Somebody told me they faint
with fright when you cook them.

57
00:05:45,497 --> 00:05:47,727
- What do you want to eat?
- What are you having?

58
00:05:47,832 --> 00:05:49,390
I'm having a café complet.

59
00:05:49,945 --> 00:05:52,311
I'll have that. And some aspirin.

60
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,200
Anything I eat has got to be
absolutely dead.

61
00:06:03,254 --> 00:06:05,154
That's why I can never eat an oyster.

62
00:06:05,655 --> 00:06:08,590
I read somewhere that they put...

63
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:14,339
...that lemon juice on them
just to stun them. You know?

64
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:15,549
What's the difference?

65
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:21,354
An unconscious oyster's just as
horrible as the fucker wide awake...

66
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:37,299
- My God! Look at this.
- Did you see that?

67
00:06:37,394 --> 00:06:38,725
What was it? A rocket?

68
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:41,562
I don't know.
I saw a guy on a motorbike.

69
00:06:49,968 --> 00:06:51,401
I've been looking for you.

70
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,094
I left a message for you.

71
00:06:53,232 --> 00:06:55,257
I didn't get it. I took a cab.

72
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:58,310
- There is a big accident right now.
- What?

73
00:06:58,383 --> 00:07:01,750
I think U.S. Drop many big bombs
on little city.

74
00:07:02,094 --> 00:07:05,120
- U.S. Bombs? You're sure?
- I think many dead.

75
00:07:05,198 --> 00:07:07,689
- Does anybody else know about it?
- Nothing at all.

76
00:07:08,526 --> 00:07:09,584
We're going.

77
00:07:09,806 --> 00:07:12,297
Not possible right now, Sydney.
Too dangerous.

78
00:07:39,402 --> 00:07:41,199
Where you going, Schanberg?

79
00:07:42,633 --> 00:07:44,066
Neak Luong.

80
00:07:44,201 --> 00:07:45,463
Neak Luong's closed.

81
00:07:45,609 --> 00:07:49,375
Don't give me that, Reeves.
You got nothing to say about this.

82
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:52,908
I got a right to go wherever I like
in this sad little country.

83
00:07:52,967 --> 00:07:57,870
That's the law. You impede me, you're
breaking the Cooper/Church Amendment!

84
00:07:57,863 --> 00:08:00,730
Well, up the Cooper/Church
Amendment's ass!

85
00:08:03,078 --> 00:08:04,238
Let's go!

86
00:08:14,692 --> 00:08:16,785
So how can I help you, Mr. Schanberg?

87
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:25,483
I'm looking for information on why
my airplane was delayed this morning.

88
00:08:26,563 --> 00:08:28,758
- Your plane was delayed?
- That's right.

89
00:08:28,867 --> 00:08:32,166
I don't know. Maybe it's
bad weather. Your flight's...

90
00:08:32,226 --> 00:08:34,285
You don't know anything about it?

91
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:35,972
No, I don't.

92
00:08:36,386 --> 00:08:37,375
All right.

93
00:08:39,105 --> 00:08:41,596
Then I'd like you
to listen to something...

94
00:08:41,697 --> 00:08:43,722
...and then I'd like a comment.

95
00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:47,698
This morning, for reasons beyond
anybody's control...

96
00:08:47,744 --> 00:08:51,840
...I spend two hours in Bangkok
staring at a seat belt sign.

97
00:08:51,871 --> 00:08:53,429
Meanwhile, my sources tell me...

98
00:08:53,568 --> 00:08:57,368
...two Army helicopters are landing
here, just across the airfield.

99
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:01,024
Half the ambulances in Phnom Penh
are waiting there to meet them.

100
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:05,442
And now there's a rumor that
the U.S. Air Force dropped a bomb...

101
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,370
...or several bombs, on Neak Luong.

102
00:09:07,485 --> 00:09:10,648
That's a rumor, and I'm not gonna
comment on a rumor.

103
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:14,778
I just want to know if that's the
reason why my airplane was delayed!

104
00:09:18,332 --> 00:09:19,299
No comment.

105
00:09:20,188 --> 00:09:21,348
How many killed?

106
00:09:24,252 --> 00:09:25,549
How many wounded?

107
00:09:30,842 --> 00:09:33,572
Thank you for your cooperation,
Major Reeves.

108
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:39,874
When I scrape this story out, I will
no doubt be quoting you in full!

109
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,946
I'm sorry.

110
00:10:22,451 --> 00:10:24,419
This is just not good enough.

111
00:10:24,531 --> 00:10:26,522
This is a big story...

112
00:10:26,643 --> 00:10:30,875
...a major story, you understand that?
We've got to get down there!

113
00:10:30,898 --> 00:10:32,991
- I know, but...
- I don't want to hear "no"!

114
00:10:33,106 --> 00:10:35,097
I want to get down that river!

115
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:36,947
We should be down there now!

116
00:10:48,752 --> 00:10:50,083
I'll be here.

117
00:10:52,496 --> 00:10:53,986
Good night, Sydney.

118
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,433
- Messages?
- No, sir.

119
00:11:04,878 --> 00:11:05,867
No, sir.

120
00:11:07,789 --> 00:11:11,020
I'd talk, but it's been
a heavy day and I've got to go.

121
00:11:11,085 --> 00:11:13,553
Let's get together again soon, okay?

122
00:11:13,644 --> 00:11:15,009
- Bob?
- See you.

123
00:11:15,404 --> 00:11:16,371
Bob?

124
00:11:17,388 --> 00:11:19,379
Hello, Sydney. Good night, Sydney.

125
00:11:19,499 --> 00:11:22,696
- Listen, I can't talk with you.
- You can talk to me.

126
00:11:22,764 --> 00:11:25,733
The embassy is jittery.
Get information from a press officer.

127
00:11:25,802 --> 00:11:28,100
Let's not start insulting each other.

128
00:11:30,218 --> 00:11:31,845
Good night, Sydney.

129
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,117
All right, good night.

130
00:11:39,305 --> 00:11:41,170
You've heard of pilot error?

131
00:11:41,289 --> 00:11:42,779
Computer malfunction?

132
00:11:43,144 --> 00:11:45,044
They screwed up on the coordinates.

133
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,926
A single B-52 dropped
its entire load on Neak Luong.

134
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,136
There's a homing beacon
in the middle of the town.

135
00:11:54,567 --> 00:11:56,558
- Casualties?
- You'll be briefed tomorrow.

136
00:11:56,678 --> 00:12:01,377
We estimate 55 military,
something like 35 civilians.

137
00:12:02,566 --> 00:12:03,794
How many?

138
00:12:06,054 --> 00:12:08,852
I hear it's in the hundreds.
Don't quote me on that.

139
00:12:08,933 --> 00:12:12,198
Will there be a dreadful bloodbath

140
00:12:12,261 --> 00:12:15,355
When the Khmer Rouge hit the town?

141
00:12:15,684 --> 00:12:18,380
Will there be a dreadful bloodbath...?

142
00:12:20,868 --> 00:12:23,063
Beer! We haven't had this
for four weeks.

143
00:12:23,363 --> 00:12:25,263
New York Times probably
had it flown in.

144
00:12:25,763 --> 00:12:29,164
- They keep it in their suite.
- We got a cellar. Don't you know?

145
00:12:29,218 --> 00:12:31,686
Americans take themselves so seriously.

146
00:12:31,778 --> 00:12:36,579
Don't be hard on the man. He's just
trying to get to the top of the heap.

147
00:12:36,578 --> 00:12:40,173
We'll just have to pay more to get
our telexes to the top of the heap.

148
00:12:40,224 --> 00:12:42,749
The man has just bought you a beer.
Now drink up.

149
00:12:42,848 --> 00:12:43,906
- Cheers.
- Cheers, Syd.

150
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:46,055
- Enjoy it.
- Off to see the telex operator?

151
00:12:46,176 --> 00:12:48,576
- New York Times goes to bed early.
- Sure!

152
00:12:50,143 --> 00:12:52,907
Khmer Rouge in the sunset

153
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,577
The Yanks all at sea...

154
00:13:00,158 --> 00:13:02,251
- All right?
- Very possible.

155
00:13:03,294 --> 00:13:04,761
Let's go then!

156
00:13:12,381 --> 00:13:13,871
This is good work.

157
00:13:48,951 --> 00:13:50,509
- How much?
- Hundred fifty.

158
00:13:57,494 --> 00:13:58,483
One hundred!

159
00:14:04,245 --> 00:14:05,712
- All right?
- All right.

160
00:14:13,173 --> 00:14:14,868
Nice going, Pran.

161
00:15:11,148 --> 00:15:13,810
- What is he saying?
- He wants you to look at his family.

162
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:18,336
To take a photograph and help him
because his child was wounded.

163
00:15:43,592 --> 00:15:45,685
Tell me what she's saying.

164
00:15:47,815 --> 00:15:49,305
She needs help.

165
00:15:53,031 --> 00:15:55,659
Her shop was destroyed last night.

166
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,143
Her husband killed.

167
00:15:58,278 --> 00:15:59,506
How many bombs?

168
00:16:01,318 --> 00:16:02,580
She doesn't know.

169
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:05,614
Does she know where the hospital is?

170
00:16:07,237 --> 00:16:08,568
"Just over there."

171
00:16:14,564 --> 00:16:16,794
She wants to know,
"Did someone arrest the pilot?"

172
00:16:19,235 --> 00:16:22,033
Mister, you wanna buy?
Mister, you wanna buy?

173
00:16:22,275 --> 00:16:25,506
- One dollar? You wanna buy?
- I'm out of film. I'm sorry.

174
00:16:26,498 --> 00:16:29,467
Ask her how many kids she's got
in her family.

175
00:16:30,561 --> 00:16:31,425
"Five."

176
00:16:31,842 --> 00:16:34,276
Her husband was killed already.

177
00:16:38,305 --> 00:16:39,567
What's this?

178
00:16:39,968 --> 00:16:41,731
What are these guys over here?

179
00:16:46,783 --> 00:16:49,684
In the jeep, prisoners.
Khmer Rouge prisoners.

180
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,731
They kill a lot of villagers.

181
00:17:14,012 --> 00:17:16,572
She says Khmer Rouge soak rags
in gasoline...

182
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:18,692
...and push them down
villagers' throat...

183
00:17:18,811 --> 00:17:20,802
...then set the rags alight.

184
00:17:20,954 --> 00:17:22,114
Film! No film!

185
00:17:22,267 --> 00:17:23,757
I know there's no film.

186
00:17:23,898 --> 00:17:25,024
No camera!

187
00:17:26,202 --> 00:17:27,260
No camera!

188
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,740
It's all right.

189
00:17:31,545 --> 00:17:32,978
Just take it easy.

190
00:17:38,648 --> 00:17:40,206
Tell them we're jour...

191
00:17:49,431 --> 00:17:50,830
Come on! Get in!

192
00:18:33,137 --> 00:18:34,764
I'm worried.

193
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,480
I'm the guy who bring you over here.

194
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,350
They accuse me and they arrest me.

195
00:18:41,808 --> 00:18:44,299
How can they arrest you?
You're already arrested.

196
00:18:45,647 --> 00:18:47,638
They phone Phnom Penh about me.

197
00:18:56,526 --> 00:18:58,016
I want some cigarettes.

198
00:19:00,045 --> 00:19:01,512
And I need to take a leak.

199
00:19:04,493 --> 00:19:06,484
Would you tell them I need to piss?

200
00:19:29,577 --> 00:19:31,067
He said, "No piss."

201
00:19:32,777 --> 00:19:33,903
What does that mean?

202
00:19:34,376 --> 00:19:36,241
That's no piss.

203
00:19:40,488 --> 00:19:42,718
I've had enough of this bullshit.

204
00:19:43,271 --> 00:19:45,262
I got a story to get to New York!

205
00:19:50,214 --> 00:19:51,511
Don't leave me!

206
00:20:01,893 --> 00:20:03,155
I won't leave you.

207
00:21:09,116 --> 00:21:11,516
They brought in the whole press corps!

208
00:21:11,612 --> 00:21:14,945
They want to sanitize the story!
Bastards!

209
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,952
I am going to tell you something.

210
00:21:27,097 --> 00:21:28,758
I'm walking out of here.

211
00:21:28,889 --> 00:21:31,221
What are you gonna do?
Blow my head off?

212
00:21:31,384 --> 00:21:34,376
You got a general out there,
this is an American passport...

213
00:21:34,457 --> 00:21:36,391
...and I am walking out of here!

214
00:21:38,967 --> 00:21:42,232
- He wants to get higher officer.
- Then get him! Get him!

215
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:54,296
I'm sorry we couldn't show you the
minor bomb damage in the city itself.

216
00:21:54,325 --> 00:21:56,122
It's still a restricted area.

217
00:21:56,245 --> 00:21:58,509
Now, if you look across the river...

218
00:21:58,613 --> 00:22:01,548
...you'll see positions held by
Khmer Rouge...

219
00:22:01,621 --> 00:22:03,418
...who moved in over
the past few days.

220
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:06,771
But the Cambodian Republican Army
is moving in on them.

221
00:22:06,836 --> 00:22:10,328
They'll have the K.R. Out
before you can say "Jack Robinson."

222
00:22:11,059 --> 00:22:12,754
Get in the chopper now!

223
00:22:12,979 --> 00:22:16,437
No, Schanberg! You came on a boat,
you go back on a boat!

224
00:22:16,498 --> 00:22:18,693
That won't stop my story!

225
00:22:21,234 --> 00:22:22,166
What is this?

226
00:22:22,322 --> 00:22:25,348
If you weren't down here,
I wouldn't be down here.

227
00:22:25,426 --> 00:22:28,327
And I don't want to be down here!
What good is it doing?

228
00:22:28,401 --> 00:22:30,232
If anybody ever reads about this...

229
00:22:30,353 --> 00:22:33,049
...you won't be able to look them
in the face!

230
00:23:11,467 --> 00:23:12,661
Good morning.

231
00:23:13,419 --> 00:23:14,408
What time is it?

232
00:23:16,266 --> 00:23:17,790
Six o'clock.

233
00:23:19,114 --> 00:23:20,012
Shit.

234
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:21,398
Telex for you.

235
00:23:21,962 --> 00:23:23,429
You been to the telex?

236
00:23:25,673 --> 00:23:27,038
We made the front page.

237
00:23:27,177 --> 00:23:28,144
Sure.

238
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,179
We must be doing something right.

239
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,345
My wife is very worried.

240
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:46,450
She thinks all foreign journalists
are going to leave Cambodia.

241
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,183
Well, Pran...

242
00:23:50,278 --> 00:23:54,681
...l'd feel kind of stupid trying to
cover this war from a desk in Bangkok.

243
00:23:55,877 --> 00:23:58,971
And she said if the war
keeps going like this...

244
00:23:59,045 --> 00:24:01,206
...the future could be very bad.

245
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:04,213
What do you think?

246
00:24:07,108 --> 00:24:08,439
I don't know.

247
00:24:10,787 --> 00:24:12,152
I don't know either.

248
00:24:14,755 --> 00:24:16,723
- Is Sarun downstairs?
- Sure.

249
00:24:17,826 --> 00:24:19,225
Let's get going.

250
00:24:20,098 --> 00:24:21,065
All right.

251
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,337
Don't go back to sleep.

252
00:24:28,481 --> 00:24:29,573
I won't.

253
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,374
K.R.'s making a push
for the airport road.

254
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,504
If they cut it,
the city could be lost.

255
00:24:42,623 --> 00:24:46,059
We hype these people up. "You'll be
all right with us," we say.

256
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,374
Now look at all this fucking mess!

257
00:24:55,197 --> 00:24:58,428
In America, everybody got a good car.

258
00:25:00,444 --> 00:25:02,810
He ask you what car you drive
in United States.

259
00:25:02,908 --> 00:25:05,968
I don't have a car in America,
only the Mercedes here.

260
00:25:06,043 --> 00:25:08,238
Mercedes, number one!

261
00:25:08,667 --> 00:25:11,192
Ask him where he learned
to speak his English.

262
00:25:13,947 --> 00:25:16,415
American advisor with his unit
teach him.

263
00:25:16,506 --> 00:25:18,565
Mercedes, number one, okay?

264
00:25:55,189 --> 00:25:56,247
What did he say?

265
00:25:56,404 --> 00:25:59,430
He said he thought all
American people left already.

266
00:25:59,924 --> 00:26:01,858
Made in the USA.

267
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,164
Are we winning?

268
00:26:06,995 --> 00:26:09,088
No, you're not winning.

269
00:26:09,203 --> 00:26:10,534
What should we do?

270
00:26:10,675 --> 00:26:13,906
Well, you make sure they don't
cut off the airport road.

271
00:26:16,626 --> 00:26:18,958
The first section came
by Route number 36.

272
00:26:19,505 --> 00:26:23,202
And the second one
came down by Route number 26.

273
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:25,740
Khmer Rouge will come down Route 3.

274
00:26:26,064 --> 00:26:27,497
He doesn't know how many.

275
00:26:27,632 --> 00:26:29,623
They expect an attack today.

276
00:26:29,745 --> 00:26:31,235
- Where's your commander?
- Phnom Penh.

277
00:26:31,376 --> 00:26:32,775
- Why there?
- Don't know.

278
00:26:32,912 --> 00:26:34,846
How many mortar rounds you have...?

279
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:52,185
Rockoff, get your ass out here!
Get out here!

280
00:26:54,573 --> 00:26:56,837
Come on, let's get him out of here!

281
00:27:23,305 --> 00:27:24,636
- Fuck this!
- They pulling out?

282
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:26,710
I'm not happy here, Syd.

283
00:27:26,825 --> 00:27:28,725
Jon, I'm leaving.

284
00:27:28,905 --> 00:27:30,463
Syd, come on!

285
00:27:30,727 --> 00:27:31,716
Come on!

286
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,177
Sydney, this way!

287
00:28:06,563 --> 00:28:08,360
Sydney, look! Khmer Rouge!

288
00:28:55,837 --> 00:28:58,772
In Washington, the
Cambodian ambassador...

289
00:28:58,844 --> 00:29:01,745
...in a speech to
the Washington Press Club said:

290
00:29:01,819 --> 00:29:04,720
"Let's face it, you took
advantage of us."

291
00:29:04,795 --> 00:29:05,693
I can't eat.

292
00:29:05,851 --> 00:29:10,686
"You are cleverer than we are, and
you induced us into this fighting."

293
00:29:11,195 --> 00:29:14,255
Indeed, the Khmer Rouge
insurgents in Cambodia...

294
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:17,493
...have tightened their ring
around the capital, Phnom Penh...

295
00:29:17,562 --> 00:29:21,157
...now swollen with some two million
refugees from the fighting.

296
00:29:21,209 --> 00:29:25,441
Reports from government troops talk
of the field situation being so bad...

297
00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:28,797
...that soldiers are having
to siphon gas from jeep to jeep...

298
00:29:28,856 --> 00:29:32,815
...in order to be able to get
the wounded back to the capital.

299
00:29:52,053 --> 00:29:53,850
No more electricity.

300
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,308
And now I get a message
to try for negotiations.

301
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,368
Well, it's just too goddamn late!

302
00:30:30,479 --> 00:30:32,811
Alan, this country's split apart.

303
00:30:32,911 --> 00:30:36,711
We put this ship to sea, and it breaks
my heart not to help it back to port.

304
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:37,842
Any port.

305
00:30:38,926 --> 00:30:42,726
What pisses me off is, this country
has faults and strengths...

306
00:30:42,766 --> 00:30:46,327
...and we have done nothing
but play to the faults.

307
00:30:48,781 --> 00:30:51,773
I tell you, I will be damn
glad to get out of here.

308
00:30:51,852 --> 00:30:56,585
This thing has dragged on too long for
it to end in all sweetness and light.

309
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:58,852
After what the Khmer Rouge
have been through...

310
00:30:58,956 --> 00:31:01,925
...they won't be exactly
affectionate toward Westerners.

311
00:31:03,851 --> 00:31:06,786
- Where do you want this?
- On the floor. Anywhere.

312
00:31:06,858 --> 00:31:10,453
- Mr. Schanberg...
- Oh, Christ, my dependents! Six.

313
00:31:10,506 --> 00:31:11,768
Dith Pran and family.

314
00:31:11,914 --> 00:31:12,938
Right.

315
00:31:14,185 --> 00:31:19,020
"Dear sir, my family and I are planning
a touring vacation of Southeast Asia...

316
00:31:19,017 --> 00:31:23,750
...and anticipate two weeks
in Cambodia touring the country.

317
00:31:24,169 --> 00:31:27,502
Would you please send tour
information and brochures?

318
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:29,857
Thanking you in advance,
Wendell Payne."

319
00:31:29,959 --> 00:31:32,860
Wendell lives in Wisacky,
South Carolina.

320
00:31:33,863 --> 00:31:35,023
What about the airlift?

321
00:31:35,175 --> 00:31:36,733
We're taking it with us.

322
00:31:37,511 --> 00:31:40,844
- People will starve to death.
- I know, but what can we do?

323
00:31:40,902 --> 00:31:43,268
Look, there could be a bloodbath here.

324
00:31:44,422 --> 00:31:48,188
Excuse the pun, but we're
either staying or we're living.

325
00:31:59,043 --> 00:32:02,501
Hello, leaving a sinking ship then,
are we, Carver?

326
00:32:07,234 --> 00:32:11,603
President Ford, in his foreign policy
speech, hardly referred to Cambodia...

327
00:32:11,617 --> 00:32:15,553
...except to say that, as of now,
it may be too late.

328
00:32:30,175 --> 00:32:31,733
I'm sorry. I'm late.

329
00:32:31,871 --> 00:32:33,133
Where you been?

330
00:32:33,407 --> 00:32:36,137
- They stop me because of the curfew.
- The curfew, huh?

331
00:32:36,222 --> 00:32:37,849
Yes. I'm sorry.

332
00:32:40,222 --> 00:32:43,680
Get started on this.
Tell them to start sending this out...

333
00:32:43,742 --> 00:32:47,439
...but hold the last two paragraphs.
I'll have corrections in an hour.

334
00:32:48,477 --> 00:32:52,470
They don't transmit today.
The transmitter at Kambol got hit.

335
00:32:53,916 --> 00:32:56,282
They say 6 p.m. We can file.

336
00:32:56,379 --> 00:32:57,812
6 p.m.

337
00:32:59,323 --> 00:33:02,690
What do you think this is?
A monthly magazine?

338
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:04,738
This is a newspaper.

339
00:33:07,514 --> 00:33:09,243
How about update tomorrow?

340
00:33:11,833 --> 00:33:14,700
Yeah, sure. We can file
an update tomorrow.

341
00:33:23,672 --> 00:33:26,072
I was over at the
American Embassy yesterday.

342
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:28,023
Good news?

343
00:33:28,184 --> 00:33:29,981
No, not good news.

344
00:33:35,671 --> 00:33:38,401
They say that when
this place goes up...

345
00:33:41,558 --> 00:33:45,153
...they think a lot of people
will be killed. A lot of people.

346
00:33:46,197 --> 00:33:49,860
I've arranged for the evacuation
of you and your family.

347
00:33:52,436 --> 00:33:54,870
So now it's up to you.
What do you want to do?

348
00:33:57,171 --> 00:33:59,196
Do you want to stay
or leave?

349
00:34:07,474 --> 00:34:08,498
And how about you?

350
00:34:09,618 --> 00:34:11,483
That's none of your business.

351
00:34:17,104 --> 00:34:19,834
Do you want to stay,
or do you want to leave?

352
00:34:23,152 --> 00:34:24,346
I know.

353
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:26,666
You love my family.

354
00:34:30,703 --> 00:34:33,604
But me, I'm reporter too.

355
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,649
You know what I mean?

356
00:34:50,156 --> 00:34:53,819
All right, we don't have
to decide this right now.

357
00:34:53,868 --> 00:34:55,233
Take it easy.

358
00:35:00,011 --> 00:35:03,105
But we'll have to make up our
minds pretty soon, right?

359
00:36:12,897 --> 00:36:15,593
All right, this is it!
Is the floor clear?

360
00:36:16,704 --> 00:36:18,399
This is the last check.

361
00:36:21,088 --> 00:36:23,648
Last check. This is the last check!

362
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:31,377
Mr. Kincaid is not here.

363
00:36:31,615 --> 00:36:34,675
Mr. Kincaid is gone.
You keep Mr. Kincaid's money.

364
00:36:34,974 --> 00:36:36,771
Now, I want you to go right now!

365
00:36:37,118 --> 00:36:38,710
I want you to leave now!

366
00:36:38,846 --> 00:36:40,939
You won't see Mr. Kincaid again!

367
00:36:53,756 --> 00:36:55,951
Okay, sergeant, let him in!

368
00:36:58,907 --> 00:37:02,206
Have you got Pran here?
Have you got Pran on there?

369
00:37:02,266 --> 00:37:04,894
- And his wife?
- Yes, sir, they are.

370
00:37:04,986 --> 00:37:08,217
- Did they come in yet?
- No, sir, they haven't arrived yet.

371
00:37:20,728 --> 00:37:22,491
Have you seen Pran?

372
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:23,604
No, I haven't.

373
00:37:24,312 --> 00:37:25,336
Where is he?

374
00:37:29,143 --> 00:37:30,940
Well, it's been real.

375
00:37:36,149 --> 00:37:37,639
They're gonna miss it.

376
00:37:38,325 --> 00:37:40,850
Why don't you check around
the other side?

377
00:37:41,397 --> 00:37:44,423
If he comes here, I'm looking
for him in the back.

378
00:37:55,923 --> 00:37:58,357
Beth! Have you seen Pran?

379
00:37:58,451 --> 00:38:00,646
No, have you looked at the hotel?

380
00:38:00,754 --> 00:38:02,619
He's at the post office!

381
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:04,522
The post office!

382
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:34,214
Get the fuck out!
Get out of here now!

383
00:38:34,382 --> 00:38:36,577
Move your asses out of here!

384
00:38:36,941 --> 00:38:38,408
Hold those doors!

385
00:38:42,157 --> 00:38:45,092
- Where do you think you're going?
- To embassy.

386
00:39:00,203 --> 00:39:01,693
Yes, sir, what's your name?

387
00:39:01,834 --> 00:39:03,199
Dith Pran family, sir.

388
00:39:03,338 --> 00:39:05,101
Dith Pran family?

389
00:39:05,225 --> 00:39:07,557
- Sydney Schanberg.
- They've been through.

390
00:39:07,913 --> 00:39:10,404
- They've been through.
- Check one more time, please.

391
00:39:10,505 --> 00:39:12,769
- You made a mistake, sir.
- No mistake.

392
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,242
Rockoff, help me!

393
00:41:29,078 --> 00:41:29,908
Run!

394
00:41:30,326 --> 00:41:31,816
There's no time!

395
00:42:37,517 --> 00:42:38,484
Wait a minute.

396
00:42:41,996 --> 00:42:43,020
Smile.

397
00:43:08,809 --> 00:43:09,867
Jon.

398
00:43:10,377 --> 00:43:11,469
Hello, Sydney.

399
00:43:28,134 --> 00:43:32,036
If the going gets rough, I heard
our best bet's the French Embassy.

400
00:43:34,534 --> 00:43:35,831
Who told you that?

401
00:43:38,628 --> 00:43:40,357
The British Embassy.

402
00:44:09,537 --> 00:44:11,198
Khmer Rouge coming.

403
00:44:11,328 --> 00:44:14,491
Look like government soldiers
give them big welcome.

404
00:45:16,055 --> 00:45:17,454
No more fighting!

405
00:45:17,751 --> 00:45:19,082
I be right back!

406
00:45:34,517 --> 00:45:36,348
No more fighting! No more war!

407
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:38,023
What do you think?

408
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:40,757
I don't like the look of this.

409
00:45:40,884 --> 00:45:45,583
I was in Keng Kang this morning.
Practically got my ass shot off.

410
00:45:45,587 --> 00:45:48,522
I just don't think these guys
are for real.

411
00:45:48,659 --> 00:45:51,856
I'm going to the hospital.
You want to come with me?

412
00:46:56,394 --> 00:46:58,760
Tetracaine, 50 milligrams, please.

413
00:46:59,465 --> 00:47:02,195
Jesus, what am I supposed to do?
Sing her a lullaby?

414
00:47:02,281 --> 00:47:04,647
Pentothal, 150 milligrams, quick.

415
00:47:15,431 --> 00:47:18,730
Jesus, another shrapnel
in the spine here.

416
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:20,485
Okay, let's have her over.

417
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:30,586
This is blood group A. We've had one
unit of blood in the last two days.

418
00:47:31,269 --> 00:47:33,294
Plasma substitute, please, quick.

419
00:47:34,085 --> 00:47:36,679
We've plenty of blood, gentlemen.
Plenty of blood.

420
00:47:36,773 --> 00:47:39,367
The problem is, it's all in
the wrong fucking place.

421
00:47:41,987 --> 00:47:46,151
Why do corpses have to pile up before
people decide it's time to go home?

422
00:48:12,671 --> 00:48:15,196
For God's sake, back up the car!
Sarun, back it up!

423
00:48:15,295 --> 00:48:17,729
For God's sake, back it up now!

424
00:49:30,261 --> 00:49:33,788
- Why doesn't he get his ass in here?
- He's trying to get in!

425
00:49:34,132 --> 00:49:35,429
They won't let him in.

426
00:49:58,001 --> 00:49:59,127
All right?

427
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,332
Okay?

428
00:56:03,487 --> 00:56:04,681
Looks all right.

429
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:58,698
I'm coming!

430
00:59:06,247 --> 00:59:08,272
Just a minute! He's with me!

431
00:59:08,454 --> 00:59:10,285
He's with The New York Times!

432
00:59:10,407 --> 00:59:13,604
Wait just a minute!
He's a journalist and he's with me!

433
00:59:14,022 --> 00:59:17,423
Where is the consul? I want to talk
to the consul. Let me see him!

434
00:59:17,541 --> 00:59:20,203
You tell me where he is.
I want to speak to him!

435
00:59:21,028 --> 00:59:24,862
The picture in Cambodia
is increasingly unclear.

436
00:59:24,901 --> 00:59:28,302
Journalists who have flown
from Thailand over Phnom Penh...

437
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:31,018
...report that the Khmer Rouge
have attempted...

438
00:59:31,108 --> 00:59:34,236
...a mass evacuation
of the entire population.

439
00:59:34,307 --> 00:59:38,869
Radio contact with the French Embassy
reveals that some 200 Europeans...

440
00:59:38,882 --> 00:59:43,182
...and an undisclosed number
of Cambodians have taken refuge.

441
00:59:43,201 --> 00:59:47,331
As yet, no statement has been made
by the new rulers of Cambodia.

442
00:59:47,361 --> 00:59:51,923
The whereabouts of Prince Sihanouk
and the Khmer Rouge leadership...

443
00:59:51,936 --> 00:59:53,403
...are not clear.

444
00:59:59,007 --> 01:00:01,441
- Okay?
- Yes. He's sleeping.

445
01:00:26,076 --> 01:00:26,940
That's the consul.

446
01:00:35,802 --> 01:00:38,737
- Did you see that, Dennis?
- The Russians are coming.

447
01:00:44,601 --> 01:00:46,364
Look, piss off! Please!

448
01:00:46,489 --> 01:00:49,617
Get out! You won't get
anything here! Out!

449
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,911
First, the main points of the news.

450
01:00:59,031 --> 01:01:00,555
BBC, Dougal.

451
01:01:03,127 --> 01:01:05,960
- Daily reports of fighting
around the airport...

452
01:01:06,039 --> 01:01:09,873
...14 kilometers outside Phnom Penh,
the capital of Cambodia.

453
01:01:10,614 --> 01:01:14,550
And now, an on-the-spot report
from our correspondent in Thailand...

454
01:01:14,582 --> 01:01:15,640
...Hugh Elder.

455
01:01:17,461 --> 01:01:19,588
Where do they get this crap?

456
01:01:20,021 --> 01:01:23,149
Do you see that guy across the gate?
The little guy?

457
01:01:24,084 --> 01:01:26,609
Could we not all look at once, please?

458
01:01:27,252 --> 01:01:30,847
I have it on reliable sources
that that's Hugh Elder.

459
01:01:31,411 --> 01:01:32,241
You're kidding.

460
01:01:32,403 --> 01:01:35,861
He's disguised, but I got suspicious
about him. You know what I mean?

461
01:01:35,922 --> 01:01:38,891
- How does he get copy out?
- How does he get his copy out?

462
01:01:38,962 --> 01:01:40,691
With specially trained hens.

463
01:01:41,873 --> 01:01:46,071
The BBC has, like, commissioned
them to walk past the Khmer Rouge...

464
01:01:46,097 --> 01:01:47,860
...like their regular fowl.

465
01:01:47,984 --> 01:01:52,512
They've been crossing the border into
Thailand every day and every night.

466
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:54,418
I told you.

467
01:01:55,216 --> 01:01:58,481
Unconfirmed reports say
the Khmer Rouge are demanding...

468
01:01:58,543 --> 01:02:02,172
...that any officials of
the defeated Lon Nol government...

469
01:02:02,223 --> 01:02:05,317
...especially the so-called
Six Traitors of the Cabinet...

470
01:02:05,391 --> 01:02:07,018
...be handed over to them.

471
01:02:07,150 --> 01:02:09,880
It is not known whether
any of the ex-ministers...

472
01:02:09,966 --> 01:02:12,059
...may have taken refuge
in the embassy...

473
01:02:12,174 --> 01:02:15,610
...where, in the words of a UNICEF
representative in Bangkok...

474
01:02:15,661 --> 01:02:19,597
...the situation is said to be
"increasingly precarious."

475
01:03:45,526 --> 01:03:49,257
And when I tried to go
just a kilometer further, no.

476
01:03:49,301 --> 01:03:51,930
The only sense I can make of it
is that there's...

477
01:03:52,021 --> 01:03:54,956
...some sort of internal
power struggle going on.

478
01:03:55,381 --> 01:03:58,782
Different groups seem to be
holding different parts of the city...

479
01:03:59,318 --> 01:04:04,119
...and they all appear to be equally
nervous over losing power and control.

480
01:04:04,469 --> 01:04:06,494
Half of them are under 15.

481
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:10,029
Some Red Cross instruction
sheets want translating.

482
01:04:10,101 --> 01:04:11,090
Can you help?

483
01:04:11,381 --> 01:04:13,815
Use Pran. He speaks French
better than I do.

484
01:04:13,909 --> 01:04:15,968
I'd prefer it if it was you.

485
01:04:26,741 --> 01:04:28,231
What did you do that for?

486
01:04:28,596 --> 01:04:30,757
The guy's insecure enough already.

487
01:04:32,852 --> 01:04:35,378
The Cambodians have
to leave the embassy.

488
01:04:37,876 --> 01:04:41,437
They want all our passports
and everybody downstairs...

489
01:04:41,779 --> 01:04:43,839
...and the Cambodians out.

490
01:05:20,212 --> 01:05:22,009
If you have papers,
you have a name.

491
01:05:22,131 --> 01:05:24,326
If we have a name,
we can find the mother.

492
01:05:24,978 --> 01:05:27,607
Look, I fight for five years.

493
01:05:28,115 --> 01:05:29,480
Useless war.

494
01:05:32,114 --> 01:05:33,081
Fuck!

495
01:05:35,346 --> 01:05:38,111
Pran is not gonna last
five minutes out there.

496
01:05:38,195 --> 01:05:41,961
The Khmer Rouge have killed every
journalist they've ever caught.

497
01:05:42,162 --> 01:05:43,857
Does Syd know how serious this is?

498
01:05:43,986 --> 01:05:47,650
- Of course he bloody knows!
- We can't let him walk out of here.

499
01:05:48,242 --> 01:05:52,303
Look, two passports. This one's
out-of-date, but the visa's valid.

500
01:05:52,338 --> 01:05:54,534
Jon Ankertill Brewer Swain.

501
01:05:54,642 --> 01:05:58,840
Knock out the Jon, knock out the Swain,
and you're left with Ankertill Brewer.

502
01:05:59,314 --> 01:06:02,751
Change my photograph for one of Pran,
and he's a British subject.

503
01:06:02,803 --> 01:06:04,031
It's worth a try.

504
01:06:04,273 --> 01:06:08,073
I hope he's got a photo because
I don't have any fucking film.

505
01:06:21,842 --> 01:06:24,174
I try to escape to Thailand right now.

506
01:06:24,273 --> 01:06:26,036
Give me two or three weeks.

507
01:06:27,377 --> 01:06:29,437
If you get there first, let me know.

508
01:06:29,905 --> 01:06:32,635
And leave message for me
at Reuters. Okay?

509
01:06:33,328 --> 01:06:37,059
Just give me an hour.
I need some time to think.

510
01:06:37,777 --> 01:06:39,768
I got no time to give you.

511
01:06:41,233 --> 01:06:42,996
Swain's got an idea.

512
01:06:48,817 --> 01:06:51,081
Ankertill Brewer.
That's the new name.

513
01:06:51,184 --> 01:06:53,709
- Ankertill Brewer.
- Right. Now, my photograph.

514
01:06:53,808 --> 01:06:56,835
- Change my photograph for yours.
- Do you have an old photo?

515
01:06:56,913 --> 01:06:57,902
I don't think so.

516
01:06:58,704 --> 01:07:00,365
Give him your passport.

517
01:07:00,496 --> 01:07:02,657
Your old passport,
a family snapshot, anything.

518
01:07:02,768 --> 01:07:03,827
Khmer Rouge took everything.

519
01:07:03,985 --> 01:07:06,010
- What about your press card?
- Everything!

520
01:07:06,128 --> 01:07:06,992
Fuck!

521
01:07:07,504 --> 01:07:10,132
- Didn't give it back.
- We'll go and find some film.

522
01:07:10,224 --> 01:07:14,252
There's film here. We'll get it.
Polaroid, any kind, any speed.

523
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:17,816
We're gonna get it,
and I'll shoot it, okay?

524
01:07:17,903 --> 01:07:19,393
We'll find the film.

525
01:07:21,425 --> 01:07:23,757
Do you have a Polaroid camera?
Do you have film?

526
01:07:23,855 --> 01:07:25,413
No, I haven't got any film!

527
01:07:25,552 --> 01:07:30,183
I've also got no metronidazole, and
this child has got amebic dysentery!

528
01:07:32,591 --> 01:07:34,855
We've gotta get sulfide
and a developer.

529
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:37,155
If we can get that,
I can make the photo.

530
01:07:37,390 --> 01:07:38,357
Shit!

531
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:42,600
Listen, I know where we can get
some water. We can drain...

532
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:45,973
...the air conditioning vent.
I've seen it done. Come on.

533
01:07:50,703 --> 01:07:53,536
Excuse me, you're Mr. Schanberg?

534
01:07:54,286 --> 01:07:57,814
I've been told that you're
in charge of bed covers.

535
01:07:57,871 --> 01:07:58,769
What?

536
01:08:00,015 --> 01:08:03,849
Blankets. We've just arrived.
We want some blankets.

537
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:06,700
Come on down here.

538
01:08:07,247 --> 01:08:09,147
Go to the end of the hall there.

539
01:08:10,350 --> 01:08:12,341
Turn to the right,
go up the stairs.

540
01:08:12,462 --> 01:08:15,796
If there are any, they'll be
at the top of the stairs.

541
01:08:15,854 --> 01:08:19,119
Syd, I have got the camera...

542
01:08:19,662 --> 01:08:21,254
...I have got the film...

543
01:08:21,646 --> 01:08:24,639
...and I have got
the fucking darkroom!

544
01:08:29,037 --> 01:08:31,267
All right. Don't smile.

545
01:08:34,222 --> 01:08:36,713
- You're smiling.
- Very serious. You are smiling.

546
01:08:37,038 --> 01:08:38,403
Stop, please.

547
01:08:38,541 --> 01:08:41,534
- Very serious.
- Very serious, very American.

548
01:08:55,754 --> 01:08:56,880
Okay, cover it.

549
01:09:02,346 --> 01:09:04,576
This fucking paper, I don't know.

550
01:09:05,193 --> 01:09:07,788
That was the stuff you found
in the coatroom.

551
01:09:09,737 --> 01:09:11,466
Ankertill Brewer.

552
01:09:12,233 --> 01:09:14,667
Ankertill Brewer.

553
01:09:29,545 --> 01:09:31,877
Getting an image.
Look at it.

554
01:09:31,976 --> 01:09:33,535
Look, the bugger's face.

555
01:09:33,674 --> 01:09:35,938
It sure is. Come on.

556
01:09:36,745 --> 01:09:38,007
Come on.

557
01:09:38,921 --> 01:09:40,013
Come on.

558
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:43,005
Now fix it.

559
01:09:44,585 --> 01:09:46,018
That's good.

560
01:09:49,192 --> 01:09:51,423
Oh, no. Fuck, it's fogging.

561
01:09:51,625 --> 01:09:52,956
Goddamn it.

562
01:09:54,185 --> 01:09:55,914
Goddamn this paper!

563
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:59,306
Goddamn it!
We're gonna have to start again.

564
01:10:08,233 --> 01:10:09,825
Okay, now we gotta fix it.

565
01:10:11,816 --> 01:10:12,874
I did it.

566
01:10:14,984 --> 01:10:16,417
Let me have that.

567
01:10:18,824 --> 01:10:19,984
It's fading.

568
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:21,807
Take it out.

569
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:25,761
No, it's already gone. The solution's
too strong. It's fading.

570
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,563
Take it out now.
I mean, if it's...

571
01:10:27,688 --> 01:10:28,746
Fuck!

572
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:31,234
Goddamn it!

573
01:10:35,016 --> 01:10:38,417
Man, this fucking room is killing me.

574
01:10:38,535 --> 01:10:39,866
Could I just...?

575
01:10:40,231 --> 01:10:42,062
I'll just do it myself, okay?

576
01:10:42,183 --> 01:10:45,517
Let me just have a few feet
in here by myself.

577
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:47,304
Fuck.

578
01:10:48,583 --> 01:10:49,515
Sorry.

579
01:11:03,527 --> 01:11:04,755
That's it.

580
01:11:20,743 --> 01:11:22,142
It's perfect.

581
01:11:23,366 --> 01:11:24,492
Perfect.

582
01:11:38,629 --> 01:11:40,927
Welcome to New York. We got it.

583
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:43,191
Perfect. Rockoff, perfect!

584
01:11:43,301 --> 01:11:45,998
Ankertill Brewer. Ankertill Brewer.

585
01:11:46,118 --> 01:11:49,747
All right, you jokers, would you like
to bring your passports over to me?

586
01:11:49,797 --> 01:11:52,265
This is the last call for passports.

587
01:11:52,901 --> 01:11:54,563
Can I have your passports, please?

588
01:11:55,238 --> 01:11:57,206
Can I have your passports, please?

589
01:11:58,469 --> 01:11:59,458
Thank you.

590
01:11:59,717 --> 01:12:01,776
Passports, ladies and gents.

591
01:12:02,982 --> 01:12:07,009
All right, you jokers, this is your
last chance to get your passports in.

592
01:12:09,924 --> 01:12:11,222
Your passports, please.

593
01:12:11,366 --> 01:12:13,527
On this passport depend my life.

594
01:12:15,045 --> 01:12:15,875
Thank you.

595
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:20,347
Passports, ladies. This is for
the big tour, the big package.

596
01:12:22,692 --> 01:12:26,150
From Thursday Island right down
to Mount Macedon...

597
01:12:26,212 --> 01:12:28,773
...to see the famous Hanging Rock.

598
01:12:28,869 --> 01:12:30,461
Come on, passports, please.

599
01:12:31,717 --> 01:12:33,810
Ladies and gentlemen, last call.

600
01:12:33,924 --> 01:12:35,118
Going...

601
01:12:35,556 --> 01:12:36,386
...going...

602
01:12:40,804 --> 01:12:41,828
...gone.

603
01:13:12,291 --> 01:13:13,486
Is this lunch?

604
01:13:18,819 --> 01:13:19,683
What?

605
01:13:22,723 --> 01:13:24,782
It seems certain
that the majority...

606
01:13:24,899 --> 01:13:29,632
...of Phnom Penh's population has
been evacuated to the countryside.

607
01:13:29,634 --> 01:13:33,002
The population is swollen
with thousands of refugees.

608
01:13:33,155 --> 01:13:34,213
Hello again.

609
01:13:38,818 --> 01:13:43,381
It'll be argued by some that this is
a way of coping with postwar chaos.

610
01:13:43,586 --> 01:13:46,054
Dennis, can you turn
that down, please?

611
01:13:48,323 --> 01:13:49,984
Now, listen, everybody.

612
01:13:51,778 --> 01:13:56,181
The trucks which we've seen arriving
are for our evacuation.

613
01:13:56,290 --> 01:13:59,158
Probably in the next 24 hours.

614
01:13:59,714 --> 01:14:02,205
Now, listen. That's to be confirmed.

615
01:14:02,562 --> 01:14:04,587
It's almost certainly for Thailand.

616
01:14:14,658 --> 01:14:16,683
These so-called journalists
have no right...

617
01:14:16,802 --> 01:14:20,966
You're not biased? You haven't
seen any atrocities in Cambodia?

618
01:14:20,993 --> 01:14:24,657
- It's just an emotional spasm!
- Yes, it is, yes. So just shut up!

619
01:14:24,705 --> 01:14:27,071
You have to break eggs
to make an omelet!

620
01:15:18,752 --> 01:15:21,186
Sydney, Ankertill Brewer.

621
01:17:26,332 --> 01:17:29,359
- Thank you. Goodbye.
- Good luck.

622
01:17:31,164 --> 01:17:33,428
- Give me these back in Paris.
- Goodbye.

623
01:17:33,532 --> 01:17:35,159
Don't forget. All right?

624
01:17:35,291 --> 01:17:38,193
Why didn't you get him out
when you had the chance?

625
01:17:38,268 --> 01:17:40,031
You had no right to keep him here!

626
01:17:40,156 --> 01:17:42,283
You've got a funny
sense of priorities.

627
01:17:42,396 --> 01:17:45,366
I'm a reporter too, Morgan.
I know his heart.

628
01:17:45,468 --> 01:17:47,527
- I love him like my brother.
- Sure.

629
01:17:47,644 --> 01:17:50,636
And I do anything for him.
Anything.

630
01:17:55,964 --> 01:17:57,329
Goodbye, Rockoff.

631
01:18:18,779 --> 01:18:21,340
Tell my wife I love her...

632
01:18:21,435 --> 01:18:23,767
...and look after all my children.

633
01:18:24,923 --> 01:18:28,359
She doesn't speak any English.

634
01:18:30,043 --> 01:18:31,442
Please...

635
01:18:32,026 --> 01:18:35,621
...I don't want anyone
to be bad to my wife.

636
01:19:10,137 --> 01:19:11,536
Dith Pran.

637
01:19:12,345 --> 01:19:15,577
P-R-A-N.
He disappeared in Phnom Penh in 1975.

638
01:19:15,642 --> 01:19:18,839
Pran is his first name.
Any information you can give.

639
01:19:19,609 --> 01:19:22,602
Well, we're hoping
for any information at all.

640
01:19:23,065 --> 01:19:26,432
He was last seen in '75.
Can you get me that number again?

641
01:19:26,490 --> 01:19:27,320
In April 1975.

642
01:19:27,481 --> 01:19:32,181
4144-5364...

643
01:20:02,648 --> 01:20:04,878
Pran is a resourceful man.

644
01:20:04,984 --> 01:20:07,613
He will wait until he knows
that it's safe...

645
01:20:07,705 --> 01:20:09,536
...and then he'll make his move.

646
01:20:25,208 --> 01:20:27,904
Thank you for coming...

647
01:20:28,056 --> 01:20:30,183
...and taking care of her
and her family.

648
01:20:30,296 --> 01:20:33,755
But she knows that
her husband is dead.

649
01:20:34,232 --> 01:20:35,597
That's not true.

650
01:20:37,175 --> 01:20:39,575
That's absolutely not true.

651
01:20:46,839 --> 01:20:48,966
It's not true. It's not.

652
01:20:50,104 --> 01:20:51,969
She doesn't believe you...

653
01:20:52,087 --> 01:20:55,147
...because she knows
her husband is dead.

654
01:21:17,206 --> 01:21:18,400
You're a good man.

655
01:21:20,662 --> 01:21:24,621
If your mother needs anything,
make sure she gets in touch with me.

656
01:21:28,278 --> 01:21:29,609
You better go.

657
01:23:06,707 --> 01:23:08,334
For the past 5 years...

658
01:23:08,819 --> 01:23:11,914
...as indicated on this map
that you see here...

659
01:23:12,212 --> 01:23:16,649
...North Vietnam has occupied
military sanctuaries...

660
01:23:16,659 --> 01:23:20,721
...all along the Cambodian frontier
with South Vietnam.

661
01:23:21,107 --> 01:23:22,438
As the President spoke...

662
01:23:22,579 --> 01:23:26,106
...American troops were preparing
to move into Cambodia.

663
01:23:28,115 --> 01:23:32,017
The decision to invade, like
the earlier secret decision to bomb...

664
01:23:32,050 --> 01:23:34,018
...was withheld from
the Cambodian people.

665
01:23:34,290 --> 01:23:37,522
We will yell at the top of our lungs.
We will move.

666
01:23:38,579 --> 01:23:42,811
It's the fear that makes a man
so scared, you know?

667
01:23:48,946 --> 01:23:51,915
There are no American
combat advisors in Cambodia.

668
01:23:51,986 --> 01:23:55,718
There will be no American
combat troops or advisors in Cambodia.

669
01:23:55,762 --> 01:23:57,286
We will aid Cambodia.

670
01:23:57,426 --> 01:24:01,829
Cambodia is the Nixon doctrine
in its purest form.

671
01:28:52,394 --> 01:28:53,521
Sydney...

672
01:28:54,187 --> 01:28:58,123
...I think of you often
and often my family.

673
01:28:58,602 --> 01:29:01,935
They tell us that God is dead.

674
01:29:02,025 --> 01:29:05,257
And now the party they call
the Angka...

675
01:29:05,322 --> 01:29:08,052
...will provide everything for us.

676
01:29:08,553 --> 01:29:11,489
He says Angka has identified...

677
01:29:11,562 --> 01:29:13,553
...and proclaims the existence...

678
01:29:13,674 --> 01:29:15,904
...of a bad new disease...

679
01:29:16,010 --> 01:29:20,914
...a memory sickness diagnosed
as thinking too much about life...

680
01:29:20,906 --> 01:29:23,875
...in prerevolutionary Cambodia.

681
01:29:24,617 --> 01:29:28,645
He says we are surrounded by enemies.

682
01:29:29,034 --> 01:29:31,468
The enemy is inside us.

683
01:29:31,849 --> 01:29:34,044
No one can be trusted.

684
01:29:42,856 --> 01:29:45,347
We must be like the ox...

685
01:29:45,448 --> 01:29:49,146
...and have no thought
except for the Party.

686
01:29:49,193 --> 01:29:52,629
No love but for the Angka.

687
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,524
People starve...

688
01:29:59,752 --> 01:30:01,845
...but we must not grow food.

689
01:30:04,584 --> 01:30:06,552
We must honor the comrade children...

690
01:30:06,664 --> 01:30:09,929
...whose minds are not corrupted
by the past.

691
01:30:37,287 --> 01:30:38,686
Is anybody of us...

692
01:30:38,824 --> 01:30:39,688
...a doctor...

693
01:30:40,264 --> 01:30:41,356
...professor...

694
01:30:41,544 --> 01:30:42,977
...and student?

695
01:30:43,368 --> 01:30:45,165
Angka needs you.

696
01:30:45,895 --> 01:30:47,864
Angka has forgiven all the past.

697
01:31:02,086 --> 01:31:03,178
Sydney...

698
01:31:04,135 --> 01:31:08,596
...Angka says that those
who were guilty of soft living...

699
01:31:08,615 --> 01:31:11,277
...in the years
of the great struggle...

700
01:31:11,366 --> 01:31:15,463
...and did not care for the sufferings
of the peasant must confess...

701
01:31:16,326 --> 01:31:19,386
...because now is the year zero...

702
01:31:19,526 --> 01:31:22,188
...and everything is to start anew.

703
01:31:30,373 --> 01:31:32,535
I'm full of fear, Sydney.

704
01:31:32,870 --> 01:31:35,668
I must show no understanding.

705
01:31:36,070 --> 01:31:38,197
Not of French or English.

706
01:31:38,565 --> 01:31:40,796
I must have no past, Sydney.

707
01:31:41,958 --> 01:31:44,085
This is the year zero...

708
01:31:44,550 --> 01:31:46,780
...and nothing has gone before.

709
01:31:58,374 --> 01:32:02,208
The wind whispers of fear and hate.

710
01:32:02,437 --> 01:32:05,429
The war has killed love, Sydney.

711
01:32:05,732 --> 01:32:09,430
And those who confess
to the Angka vanish.

712
01:32:09,605 --> 01:32:12,972
And no one dare ask where they go.

713
01:32:13,189 --> 01:32:17,490
Here, only the silent survive.

714
01:37:47,516 --> 01:37:50,111
Mercedes, number one!

715
01:43:09,716 --> 01:43:14,119
Anyone who knows my work will know
that half of this belongs to Dith Pran.

716
01:43:16,436 --> 01:43:20,429
Without Pran, I wouldn't have been able
to file half the stories I did.

717
01:43:22,451 --> 01:43:25,944
It's nice to congratulate ourselves
on occasions like this.

718
01:43:26,131 --> 01:43:28,258
But I can't stand here tonight...

719
01:43:28,371 --> 01:43:31,033
...without thinking
of those innocent people...

720
01:43:31,122 --> 01:43:35,753
...Pran dedicated himself to helping
me bring to the notice of the public.

721
01:43:38,226 --> 01:43:41,663
As they pondered their options
in the White House...

722
01:43:41,715 --> 01:43:46,049
...the men who decided to bomb
and then to invade Cambodia...

723
01:43:46,514 --> 01:43:48,948
...concerned themselves
with many things:

724
01:43:50,163 --> 01:43:54,224
Great power conflicts
and collapsing dominoes...

725
01:43:55,314 --> 01:43:58,181
...looking tough and dangerous
to the North Vietnamese...

726
01:43:58,354 --> 01:44:02,655
...relieving pressure on the American
troop withdrawal from the South.

727
01:44:03,410 --> 01:44:05,674
They had domestic concerns as well...

728
01:44:05,777 --> 01:44:10,579
...which helps explain why they kept
the bombing of Cambodia a secret.

729
01:44:11,186 --> 01:44:14,883
And they may be assumed not to have
ignored self-interest...

730
01:44:14,929 --> 01:44:16,522
...in their own careers.

731
01:44:17,202 --> 01:44:19,898
What they specifically were not
concerned with...

732
01:44:19,986 --> 01:44:22,511
...were the Cambodians themselves.

733
01:44:22,801 --> 01:44:24,632
Not the people...

734
01:44:25,009 --> 01:44:27,001
...not the society...

735
01:44:27,378 --> 01:44:29,005
...not the country.

736
01:44:30,162 --> 01:44:33,529
Except in the abstract
as instruments of policy.

737
01:44:37,169 --> 01:44:38,932
Dith Pran and I...

738
01:44:39,569 --> 01:44:41,560
...tried to record and bring home...

739
01:44:41,681 --> 01:44:45,448
...the concrete consequences
of these decisions to real people.

740
01:44:45,809 --> 01:44:47,606
To human beings...

741
01:44:48,785 --> 01:44:51,549
...the people left out
of the Administration's plans...

742
01:44:51,634 --> 01:44:53,465
...but who paid the price...

743
01:44:53,585 --> 01:44:55,780
...and took the beating for them.

744
01:45:00,945 --> 01:45:05,109
I'm very pleased to accept this
on behalf of Dith Pran and myself.

745
01:45:05,456 --> 01:45:07,083
I'm very honored...

746
01:45:07,664 --> 01:45:10,327
...and I know that Pran would be
very proud.

747
01:45:22,416 --> 01:45:26,147
Do you plan to continue
with that theme in the future?

748
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:31,324
Congratulations, Ernie.
Do it again next year!

749
01:45:31,407 --> 01:45:32,806
I'm sorry.

750
01:45:35,696 --> 01:45:38,597
- That was great, really good.
- Better than last year.

751
01:45:39,343 --> 01:45:41,903
Abe, meet my sister.

752
01:45:41,999 --> 01:45:43,830
I'm very happy to meet you.

753
01:45:43,951 --> 01:45:46,420
That's my dad.
Would you hold this for me?

754
01:45:47,375 --> 01:45:48,342
One second.

755
01:45:48,495 --> 01:45:51,692
I hoped you could recommend
a good school for journalism.

756
01:45:51,759 --> 01:45:54,729
I told my daughter I'd be
seeing you today.

757
01:45:54,799 --> 01:45:57,666
Just one minute, okay?
I'll be right back.

758
01:46:06,318 --> 01:46:10,118
Could I have your autograph?
I'm a great admirer of yours.

759
01:46:12,463 --> 01:46:15,159
Congratulations on your award,
it was well-deserved.

760
01:46:15,247 --> 01:46:18,512
Very impressive.
I was hoping you'd burst into song.

761
01:46:19,791 --> 01:46:22,521
- What are you doing here?
- You know what bothers me?

762
01:46:22,606 --> 01:46:23,436
What?

763
01:46:23,791 --> 01:46:26,487
It bothers me that you let Pran
stay in Cambodia...

764
01:46:26,573 --> 01:46:29,702
...because you wanted to win,
and you knew you needed him...

765
01:46:29,774 --> 01:46:32,504
- I didn't have any idea what...
- The fuck you didn't!

766
01:46:34,222 --> 01:46:36,349
The fuck you didn't.

767
01:46:36,845 --> 01:46:40,338
I did everything I could,
and I'm doing everything I can.

768
01:46:40,398 --> 01:46:42,730
Nice to see you.
I'm on my way to Florida.

769
01:46:42,830 --> 01:46:44,388
I'm doing everything I can.

770
01:46:44,525 --> 01:46:47,825
I'm sure. I didn't realize
you'd been out there to see him.

771
01:46:47,886 --> 01:46:51,151
Don't play games with me, Al.
Don't play stupid games.

772
01:46:51,214 --> 01:46:54,878
Nobody gets to go in there.
If I thought I could, I would.

773
01:46:55,566 --> 01:46:57,591
I've sent out hundreds of photographs.

774
01:46:57,709 --> 01:47:01,372
Every relief organization
on the Thai-Kampuchean border...

775
01:47:04,781 --> 01:47:08,581
...has got his picture. If I saw
one glimmer of hope, I'd go today.

776
01:47:08,941 --> 01:47:10,465
Life isn't a '40s movie.

777
01:47:10,605 --> 01:47:14,440
You can't just get on a plane and
make the whole world come out right!

778
01:47:15,821 --> 01:47:18,619
And I can't believe
I'm hearing this from you!

779
01:47:23,117 --> 01:47:24,414
Congrats.

780
01:47:26,348 --> 01:47:28,908
Do you keep in touch
with Dith Pran's family?

781
01:47:29,004 --> 01:47:31,200
Yes. They're living in San Francisco.

782
01:47:31,309 --> 01:47:34,176
How do you respond to accusations
that journalists...

783
01:47:34,252 --> 01:47:36,618
...underestimated the brutality
of the Khmer Rouge...

784
01:47:36,716 --> 01:47:40,448
...and so share responsibility for
what happened in Cambodia afterwards?

785
01:47:40,941 --> 01:47:42,772
We made a mistake.

786
01:47:43,244 --> 01:47:45,838
Maybe we underestimated
the kind of insanity...

787
01:47:45,932 --> 01:47:48,458
...that $ 7 billion worth
of bombing could produce.

788
01:47:48,556 --> 01:47:49,716
That is provocative...

789
01:47:49,868 --> 01:47:53,269
There have been a lot of refugee
stories in Reader's Digest...

790
01:47:53,324 --> 01:47:55,758
...about Cambodia.
Do you believe them?

791
01:47:55,851 --> 01:47:57,410
Don't you believe them?

792
01:47:57,548 --> 01:48:01,416
Maybe in this instance the
Reader's Digest happens to be correct.

793
01:48:01,452 --> 01:48:03,750
Do you apply the same disbelief
to stories...

794
01:48:03,851 --> 01:48:06,343
...that come out of Iran
or Palestine or Chile?

795
01:48:06,444 --> 01:48:08,810
Are refugees your next area
of interest?

796
01:48:08,907 --> 01:48:11,341
Will you be covering the boat people?

797
01:48:11,435 --> 01:48:12,561
No, I will not.

798
01:48:12,715 --> 01:48:14,411
Do you want a cup of tea?

799
01:48:15,276 --> 01:48:18,871
Are you looking around for some kind
of more salable suffering?

800
01:48:21,195 --> 01:48:23,824
I must have sent 500 letters.

801
01:48:29,002 --> 01:48:32,734
I wrote the International Red Cross,
the World Health Organization.

802
01:48:32,779 --> 01:48:35,475
I know you did, Syd.
You told me.

803
01:48:35,851 --> 01:48:38,115
I don't know who I didn't write to.

804
01:48:44,235 --> 01:48:46,897
I never really gave him any choice.

805
01:48:52,010 --> 01:48:55,138
One time we tried to discuss leaving.

806
01:49:03,594 --> 01:49:07,053
I talked to him about it,
but we never really discussed it.

807
01:49:10,090 --> 01:49:13,389
I discussed it with Swain and Rockoff.

808
01:49:17,097 --> 01:49:19,622
But I never discussed it with him.

809
01:49:30,249 --> 01:49:33,185
He stayed because
I wanted him to stay.

810
01:49:38,857 --> 01:49:40,722
And I stayed because...

811
01:53:11,076 --> 01:53:12,942
I'm trapped, Sydney.

812
01:53:13,060 --> 01:53:17,258
I know he suspects me,
and yet he treats me well.

813
01:53:17,699 --> 01:53:21,100
There are many different groups
over here, Sydney.

814
01:53:21,251 --> 01:53:23,345
I must take much care.

815
01:53:23,779 --> 01:53:27,840
Now Angka says we have new enemies.

816
01:53:28,195 --> 01:53:33,099
They say we must regain
our old lands from the Vietnamese.

817
01:53:33,635 --> 01:53:37,537
And now they say we must fight them.

818
01:53:39,107 --> 01:53:43,305
I miss you, my wife, my children.

819
01:53:43,330 --> 01:53:46,788
And my heart hungers for news of you.

820
01:54:09,794 --> 01:54:11,318
New China Radio reports...

821
01:54:11,457 --> 01:54:14,757
...that fighting between Vietnam
and Democratic Kampuchea...

822
01:54:14,818 --> 01:54:17,184
...has broken out
on a number of fronts.

823
01:54:17,346 --> 01:54:20,076
This is in retaliation,
according to the Vietnamese...

824
01:54:20,161 --> 01:54:22,595
...for a number of attacks
on border villages...

825
01:54:26,082 --> 01:54:27,447
Taxi driver, huh?

826
01:54:44,513 --> 01:54:46,344
I think you speak English.

827
01:54:46,720 --> 01:54:48,017
Sit down.

828
01:54:53,921 --> 01:54:56,446
You know, I love this country.

829
01:54:58,080 --> 01:55:00,879
I sacrificed everything for it.

830
01:55:02,177 --> 01:55:05,669
My wife died for the revolution.

831
01:55:07,361 --> 01:55:12,060
But the leaders of Angka
no longer trust the people.

832
01:55:12,768 --> 01:55:16,330
Therefore, I can no longer trust them.

833
01:55:17,952 --> 01:55:20,011
And they don't trust me.

834
01:55:22,336 --> 01:55:23,200
I fear...

835
01:55:24,512 --> 01:55:26,845
...really fear for the future.

836
01:55:30,976 --> 01:55:34,469
I think you love my son.

837
01:55:37,311 --> 01:55:38,573
For his sake...

838
01:55:39,551 --> 01:55:40,950
...look after him.

839
01:55:45,343 --> 01:55:47,937
The fighting is close by, Sydney.

840
01:55:48,031 --> 01:55:50,499
If the Vietnamese get here...

841
01:55:50,590 --> 01:55:52,752
...Angka will destroy everything...

842
01:55:54,719 --> 01:55:56,277
...and the Vietnamese,
they will find only ashes.

843
01:58:57,786 --> 01:59:01,222
I must try to stop the killing.
Good luck.

844
02:07:57,516 --> 02:07:59,416
Yeah, I'll be right there, Brian.

845
02:08:02,156 --> 02:08:06,115
Ann, get me 415-555-6421.

846
02:08:06,156 --> 02:08:07,851
Abe, I've got some great news!

847
02:08:20,460 --> 02:08:23,520
Twenty minutes ago, I get
a phone call from Paris.

848
02:08:23,595 --> 02:08:26,496
I get Andreas Freund.
He talked to Henry.

849
02:08:26,571 --> 02:08:28,665
He told him how to get in touch
with me.

850
02:08:28,779 --> 02:08:31,646
Freund says, "I have got
some great news for you."

851
02:08:31,723 --> 02:08:34,351
- San Francisco's on the line.
- "It's about Pran!"

852
02:08:34,603 --> 02:08:36,299
Is your mother there?

853
02:08:38,731 --> 02:08:39,891
When?

854
02:08:42,154 --> 02:08:44,817
All right,
I want you to get this down.

855
02:08:45,515 --> 02:08:48,177
No, write it down. Write it down.

856
02:08:49,546 --> 02:08:51,673
I've got a message from your dad!

857
02:10:01,544 --> 02:10:02,738
How you been?

858
02:10:15,240 --> 02:10:16,264
Do you forgive me?

859
02:10:16,904 --> 02:10:19,498
Nothing to forgive, Sydney.
Nothing.
