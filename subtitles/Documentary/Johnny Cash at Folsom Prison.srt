00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,590
Actually, I heard...

3
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,340
he's bald.

4
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,010
I hear he's bald.

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,350
That's all I heard. Here he comes.

6
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,480
Wow, look at this bastard.

7
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,780
He certainly has a great impression.

8
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:40,610
Wow.

9
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,970
Do you feel better...

10
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,890
Die, you jerk.

11
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,370
Isn't Je-hyeok here?

12
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:42,420
Where's Je-hyeok?

13
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:04,610
PRISON PLAYBOOK

14
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,790
That's the bastard who stabbed Je-hyeok
on the shoulder.

15
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,800
I know. I read the file too.

16
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,840
But what can we do?

17
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,170
I heard Crony is Seagull's boy.

18
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,800
Every wing is filled with Seagull's boys.
They're everywhere.

19
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,180
You know we can't put accomplices

20
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,060
and members of the same gang
in the same wing.

21
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,730
That's why Wing 2 must be
the only wing available.

22
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:41,150
Still, how can the assailant and victim
be in the same cell? That's not right!

23
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:46,200
CRPT is going to monitor Crony closely
at all times. 24 hours a day.

24
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,410
He won't be able to make trouble.

25
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,700
It's not him, but Je-hyeok.

26
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,580
What?

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,330
Do you think Je-hyeok will leave
that bastard alone?

28
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,820
Crony is a total scumbag.

29
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,410
Come on. Just give it a few days.

30
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:34,490
The warden will move him
when he finds out.

31
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,210
Why did he have to be transferred in
while the warden is away?

32
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,380
What a big mess.

33
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,590
Where's the warden?

34
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,380
Training.
He went to Switzerland for training.

35
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,090
What about Lieutenant Na? I'll ask him.

36
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,760
He went with him.

37
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:55,180
I told Lieutenant Paeng
when I saw his file,

38
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:58,100
so Lieutenant Paeng
will take care of it, okay?

39
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:02,730
You know how much he cares
about the inmates from his wing.

40
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,610
<i>You asshole!</i>

41
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:09,360
Shut up! Keep it down, you bastard!

42
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,620
Please, enough with the "bastard."

43
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,780
I said, "No." Hey, listen carefully.

44
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,410
Inmate 6667. Headache.

45
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,330
How many times must I tell you
I won't do it, you shit?

46
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,130
No! I won't do it! I refuse!

47
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,840
Yes, please don't.

48
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,380
Please ask my sister to come. Please?

49
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,800
Please ask my sister to visit me.

50
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,970
All it takes is one phone call!

51
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,180
Why won't you do it? Why?

52
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:41,440
Hey! You devil bastard!

53
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,400
Do you think I have time to kill,
that I'd call your sister?

54
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,320
I won't do it, bastard.

55
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,910
Do you take me for a fucking fool
or something?

56
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,000
CUCUMBER SOAP

57
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:34,910
Mr. Baldy.

58
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,370
If you get caught with those,
they'll send you to the hole.

59
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:41,580
All of those items are banned.

60
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,000
Throw them away before I report you.

61
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,880
Do these assholes want a beating?

62
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,260
Butt out,

63
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,050
before I kill both of you.

64
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,100
That's my spot starting today.

65
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,220
Got that?

66
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,520
You. Do you get it?

67
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,570
You're the cell boss, right?

68
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,860
Why this bastard.

69
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:58,370
Why the fuck do you keep staring at me,
you shit?

70
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,920
Kaist! Bring me a spoon knife.

71
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,710
I'll cut this bastard's tongue off.

72
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:12,300
This asshole won't stop talking.
It's annoying as hell!

73
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,680
Don't even try it.

74
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,260
Shut your trap.

75
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,980
If I catch you do anything shady
in this cell,

76
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,440
I'll kill you right then and there.

77
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,560
Got it?

78
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,520
Got it, asshole?

79
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,870
I'm sure he'll be fine.
Je-hyeok isn't a child.

80
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,410
If you're that worried,

81
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,580
live in the cell with him.

82
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,920
Je-hyeok is so lucky.
Everyone has his back.

83
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,670
If any incident occurs in the cell,
you'll get a demerit too.

84
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,010
I'm already maxed out.

85
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,720
I see. Lieutenant Lee.
You were worried about me.

86
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,600
I'm so grateful.

87
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,020
So very grateful.

88
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:08,980
I see.

89
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,660
OPEN REFORM, EMPATHETIC REFORM

90
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,510
How did you know?

91
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,630
Lieutenant Paeng told us.

92
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:42,180
He was so shocked
that he ran over and told us who he was.

93
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:45,180
He's the jerk who stabbed you
in the shoulder, right?

94
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,390
That evil bastard.

95
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,850
Lieutenant Paeng said
to take control first,

96
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,650
so I did that for now,

97
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,940
but it's obvious he's a scumbag.

98
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,860
Don't do anything alone from now on.

99
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,570
Crony will target you when you're alone.

100
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,990
Lieutenant Paeng said
he'll try to move him

101
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,700
when the warden gets back,
so hang in there for a few days.

102
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,370
Why should he do that?

103
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,290
Je-hyeok Kim. You get him first.

104
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,550
That asshole. He destroyed your shoulder.

105
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,420
Don't hold it in. No, I couldn't.

106
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:23,130
Kim, you stab that bastard too.
Get back at him.

107
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,760
Stab whom?

108
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,640
Stab, stab, block, block.

109
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,100
Side, side. Turn.

110
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,190
<i>The Drums of the Frontier</i>
with Hyung-rae Shim.

111
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:37,900
My mom loved that.

112
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,150
"Hello, there."

113
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,070
I did that a lot.

114
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,030
Stab...

115
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:11,520
Wow.

116
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:13,690
Look who's here.

117
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,070
You're playing baseball again?

118
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,410
How?

119
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:32,910
I was sure I tore up your shoulder.

120
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:35,960
You son of a bitch!

121
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,340
I said to shut your trap!

122
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,130
Say one more word.

123
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,510
I'll pop every single blood vessel
in your body.

124
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,180
Shit!

125
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:02,190
I'm going to sleep. Goodnight.

126
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,840
Looney, sleep here tonight.

127
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:31,180
I want to sleep next to Jung-woo tonight.

128
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,150
Come here.

129
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,820
I'll protect you.

130
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,870
Will it be curry-flavored shit,

131
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,790
or shit-flavored curry?

132
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,880
That is the question.

133
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,280
I'm worried about Crony.

134
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,740
I know that bastard. He's like a parasite.

135
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,030
He survives by being a servant
to the number-one guy.

136
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:39,040
I'm sure he's frantically searching
for his new boss.

137
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:41,620
He's found him already.

138
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,310
I'm sure he's frantically searching
for his new boss.

139
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:47,890
He's found him already.

140
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,070
He found him
and is being a servant already.

141
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,160
<i>The worst trash in our prison.</i>

142
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,990
<i>The aggravated rape bastard,</i>

143
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,950
<i>and the negligent homicide punk.
He stuck to them.</i>

144
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,710
<i>He knew exactly where the garbage was.</i>

145
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,380
<i>Those scumbags.</i>

146
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,470
Here. Split these among yourselves.

147
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,970
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

148
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,110
You're Seagull's boy?

149
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,570
Yes, sir.

150
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,700
Boss, please take me in.

151
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,000
Take what in, you bastard?

152
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,500
Do you want this?

153
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,960
Thank you, boss.

154
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,510
Wasn't Seagull transferred
because of Je-hyeok?

155
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:05,970
I hear his sentence was extended
and he's south somewhere. Is that right?

156
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,770
I keep myself informed even in here.

157
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:12,440
Je-hyeok ratted him out, right?

158
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,560
That's why he stabbed Je-hyeok.

159
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:17,690
He's the bastard
who killed Je-hyeok's shoulder.

160
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:20,450
Then he must want to kill you
whenever he sees you.

161
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,160
You'd better keep running.

162
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,740
A lot of people have his back.

163
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,540
If he catches you,
he'll stab you for sure.

164
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,160
I'll strike first.

165
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,460
If you strike him hard enough,

166
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,760
he'll retaliate right away.

167
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,590
That's why I plan
to kill Je-hyeok this time.

168
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,180
I promised Seagull.

169
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:46,760
How?

170
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:51,390
Look around. There are eyes everywhere.

171
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,480
How will you get Je-hyeok?
He's surrounded by people.

172
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:55,900
How will you get him?

173
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:59,610
When he's alone.

174
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:03,240
I'll get him when he's alone.

175
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,780
I'm sure I'll get a chance.

176
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,120
Do you need some boys?

177
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,040
No, I'm fine.

178
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,370
I'll stab him in the throat in one blow.

179
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,500
I stabbed him in the shoulder
to keep him from playing baseball,

180
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,760
but not this time.

181
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:26,260
This time, I'll stab him in the throat
once I get a chance.

182
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,720
I don't need anyone, boss.

183
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,480
Hey, you!

184
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,900
Disperse!

185
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:54,960
INCINERATOR

186
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,220
Hello.

187
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,130
How have you been?

188
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,350
Should I just leave these here?

189
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,520
Have a nice day.

190
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,040
What are you doing there?

191
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,340
Return to the yard. Exercise time is over.

192
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,840
Okay.

193
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:58,480
I said not to go anywhere alone.

194
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,860
Looney, Jung-woo.
You take out the trash now.

195
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,110
-Okay.
-It's okay.

196
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,030
I can do that much.

197
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,610
It's okay. I'll do it.

198
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:11,200
Doesn't your wing have an errand boy?

199
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,870
Our wing's errand boy
had an allergic reaction,

200
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,330
and has been in the infirmary for 13 days.

201
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,000
I never thought he was useful,
but it's so inconvenient without him.

202
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,210
It's so annoying.

203
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,750
What is he saying?

204
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,420
You understood, you bastard.

205
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:28,220
I barely understood. Barely.

206
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,220
I'm so tired.

207
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,100
Have you no manners?

208
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,560
Who taught you to be rude to adults?

209
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,140
You should act like an adult
to be an adult.

210
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:40,310
You're a gambler and scammer.
You're no "adult."

211
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,940
I'm too tired. Don't talk to me.

212
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:48,950
You can't even function because
the drugs wore out. Don't judge me.

213
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,990
The drugs didn't wear out.
I'm doing my best

214
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,370
not to take drugs anymore.

215
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:57,700
I don't live by my instincts
like some animals like you do.

216
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,710
I am...

217
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,880
fighting it with my own will.

218
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,760
Fighting it, my ass.
How long do you think you'll last?

219
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,630
It's imminent. Imminent.

220
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,850
It is not. It's been a really
long time since I took drugs.

221
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:16,510
Of course, not. There are no drugs here.

222
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,890
I didn't take cold medicine either.

223
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,850
I'm the only druggie here
who quit even cold medicine.

224
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,270
Show some respect.

225
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,730
Show what? Don't use fancy words,
you bastard.

226
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,900
Hey, Jung-woo!
Bring me some boiling water.

227
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,110
I'm going to pour it on them.

228
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,160
We can just pour it on Looney.

229
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,540
Being rude to adults is just despicable.
The worst.

230
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:42,290
Hear that, punk? He's on my side too.

231
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,790
What the... Fine.

232
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,000
You're on the scammer's side, is that it?

233
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:48,840
A scammer over a druggie.

234
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:53,390
I despise druggies the most.
They're weak and have no will power.

235
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,760
Did you come in here
for doing volunteer work?

236
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,480
For me,

237
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:06,020
my right hand is the assailant,
and my left hand is the victim.

238
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,190
I'm different from you.

239
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:11,950
At least I didn't hurt anyone else.

240
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:16,490
Hey.

241
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,540
He's suffering from withdrawal.

242
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,710
Now? He quit so long ago.

243
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:33,130
He really must've hung in there
without taking cold medicine.

244
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,720
You know, when heavy drug addicts quit,

245
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:42,560
they become more out of it
like someone who's high,

246
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:47,520
and once that fades, most of them
can't handle it and get high again.

247
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:51,320
But this guy fought it well,
and didn't take anything.

248
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,160
Why? The constant yawning
and chills are symptoms.

249
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,070
These are typical withdrawal symptoms.

250
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,370
What does that mean?

251
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:03,540
It means he's been enduring very well.

252
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:10,750
Good job.

253
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,010
Good job, Looney.

254
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,850
Can he stay a few days?

255
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,100
Yes, sure.

256
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:24,810
It may be more dangerous for him
to be walking around in that state.

257
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,390
Thank you.

258
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,520
This punk...

259
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,140
Inmate 6256, Dong-ho Ahn. Training.

260
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,900
God...

261
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:20,990
He's gone.

262
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:27,370
I'm freaking tired
because of that bastard.

263
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,290
I was dying to talk. That asshole.

264
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,920
My head hurts from staring him down
so hard.

265
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,510
Does anyone have anything for headaches?
Let me have one.

266
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,420
Thanks.

267
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,510
Hang in there until the warden returns.

268
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:42,760
I'm really okay.

269
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,890
I'll protect myself.

270
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,820
Crony isn't here right now.

271
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,620
It became a habit after one night.

272
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,380
I got confused too.

273
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:17,590
I didn't sleep a wink last night.

274
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,760
Who did? I didn't sleep a wink either.

275
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,180
How long do we have to live like this?

276
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,250
What a joke.

277
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,340
Min-chul.

278
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,260
Must we really go this far?

279
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,850
Didn't you see Crony's eyes?

280
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,260
His eyes glazed over.

281
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:53,890
He's on the brink of doing something.

282
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,480
We'll protect Je-hyeok. Got it?

283
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:02,110
Okay. It's just a few days.

284
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:03,860
Oh, right.

285
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:08,700
How is your retrial petition going?
Did you submit it yet?

286
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,830
Not yet. My brother is preparing
the documents now.

287
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:13,290
Soon.

288
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,210
We'll submit the petition soon.

289
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:17,750
It'll go well.

290
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:18,920
Don't worry.

291
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:27,930
A picture of Private Park's watch
stopped at 1:55 a.m.

292
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:31,720
This one photo made Jung-min and me
come this far.

293
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:33,810
NIGHT DUTY LOG
SEPTEMBER 20, 2016

294
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,060
PRIVATE JUN-YEONG PARK

295
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,520
We have the night duty log
with Private Park's name on it,

296
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,980
and now, an eye witness.

297
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:44,780
We're set now, right?

298
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:47,950
Let's request a retrial right away.

299
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:52,910
Our attorney, Mr. Kang, is very cautious.

300
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:53,870
Sorry?

301
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:58,000
Okay, we have our bullets ready to go.

302
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,750
Now, we have to report Sergeant Oh.

303
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:04,550
The most important thing for the retrial

304
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:07,680
is to prove Sergeant Oh committed perjury.

305
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,680
That means we need more soldiers

306
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,970
to testify that they witnessed
what actually happened.

307
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,100
That makes our case stronger.

308
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:19,650
We need that to get the petition
for retrial granted.

309
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:25,820
Then I'll meet with the soldiers
and talk to them.

310
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:27,950
If they won't agree,

311
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,320
I'll threaten them or something.

312
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:33,910
I'm sure Corporal Choi
and Corporal Lim will listen.

313
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,540
That would be great.

314
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:39,250
We need to gather
anything we can right now. Why?

315
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:42,710
Because Sergeant Oh's side
is on the move too.

316
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,090
<i>Next on the news.</i>

317
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,960
And at least because of that,

318
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,720
it'll be bad if the case
gains attention again.

319
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,050
<i>This morning,</i>

320
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,800
<i>Senator Tae-gu Oh announced
his candidacy for a fourth term.</i>

321
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:58,180
<i>He was a member
of the National Defense Committee</i>

322
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:02,810
<i>and led many movements
such as reviving commercial regions.</i>

323
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,110
<i>Senator Oh came in first
in a recent survey by a large margin,</i>

324
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:10,110
<i>and is favored to win the election.</i>

325
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,280
He has a lot of money and has
many connections in the legal world.

326
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,700
He'll have an impressive legal team.

327
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:17,160
Hey.

328
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,290
Your firm is huge too.

329
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:23,080
That's right. Of course. Trust me.

330
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:25,800
Don't worry. We will win, no matter what.

331
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,890
Bro. Just a minute.

332
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:46,520
Ice cappuccino.

333
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,400
How did you know? Thanks.

334
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:52,820
I've been cleaning the office lately.

335
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,820
I sneaked a peak in the computer.

336
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:55,780
I hear you. Shit.

337
00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:00,910
I looked at your fan site
and read Gocheok Gunman's blog.

338
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,460
It has 100,000 Q&A about Je-hyeok Kim.

339
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,840
You should read it sometime.

340
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,840
He knows everything about you.

341
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:14,090
Joon-ho. Can't you ask Gocheok Gunman
to come visit?

342
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,100
If you let him meet Je-hyeok,

343
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,810
I'm sure he'll love you like a brother.

344
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,310
No way.

345
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,020
Seriously, meet him.

346
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,650
You may know him already.
I didn't think of that.

347
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,070
Yes, I'm sure he does.

348
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:33,740
Diehard fans usually know each other.

349
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,370
They're closer than most brothers.

350
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:38,410
You bastard.

351
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,370
You didn't take Crony out yet, right?

352
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:48,210
Do you want to just sleep here?
I'm too worried. I can't take it.

353
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:53,010
I'll protect myself.
Everyone must think I'm a weakling.

354
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:56,550
No. I'm not worried about you.
I'm worried about Crony.

355
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:01,310
I'm worried that you'll cause trouble.

356
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:05,230
Hey. If he loses his mind,
he's worse than most of the thugs here.

357
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,810
Wasn't that in that 100,000 Q&A?

358
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,900
It probably is, but I read only
10 pages so far.

359
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,440
There are 1,000 pages.

360
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:16,360
And I know Je-hyeok is psychotic.

361
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:19,330
I saw it myself. I saw him take down
Seagull at the detention center.

362
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,790
I'm also worried about Crony.

363
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:28,330
He'll get stepped on good this time,
if he acts out.

364
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:33,800
Then Je-hyeok may have his sentence
extended or get demerits or something.

365
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,970
Don't you worry. I won't cause trouble.

366
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,050
I can finally play baseball again.

367
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:45,100
I finally got my form back.
Why would I do that? I won't.

368
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:48,690
Don't you worry. Nothing will happen.

369
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:51,690
Wow. You have your temper
under so much control now.

370
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:54,240
How can you not get angry? I can't.

I'm honing my mind.

I can't ruin my life

381

I'll hold it in.

382
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,100
I'm trying to forgive him.

383
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:29,730
I'm trying my best
to think only about baseball.

384
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,520
What if he suddenly stabs you?

385
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:35,150
What if he comes and stabs you
while you're cultivating your mind?

386
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:38,360
What, would I just sit there
while he comes at me?

387
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,490
I'll try to avoid him.

388
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:45,330
I won't let him come at me.

389
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,040
It's okay. Nothing will happen.

390
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,290
My cellmates are helping, too.

391
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,210
Oh, my goodness. What a saint.

392
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:07,680
Gratitude.

393
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,150
No. Courage.

394
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:14,110
Edelweiss' meaning is "courage."

395
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:17,570
Have courage.

396
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,610
You'll take the mound again.

397
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:22,660
Thank you.

398
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,080
What's with them?

399
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,920
No clue.

400
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:34,210
Min-chul's been exuding estrogen lately.

401
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,550
He's so sappy.

402
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,840
What about that?

403
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:42,180
Guess what that flower means.

404
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,680
What's its name?

405
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,470
Poppy. Red poppy.

406
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:48,890
You can grow it.

407
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,680
What does poppy mean?

408
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,480
Looney?

409
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,400
Looney should be okay, right?

410
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:06,280
Wow. Is he Sleeping Beauty or something?

411
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:09,700
How many hours is he sleeping?
He does open his eyes, right?

412
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,580
Amazing. Who knew
a person could sleep so much?

413
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:15,380
He woke up an hour ago and had porridge.

414
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,920
Did you just get here?

415
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,510
Did you come straight here?
The afternoon shift?

416
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:23,180
Yes. Lieutenant asked me to do something
on his way out.

417
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:26,720
He said to bring a gift for Looney
for really quitting drugs.

418
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:29,770
-Here.
-Wow. Ice cream.

419
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:32,690
That's something you can't have in prison.

420
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:35,310
But he's sleeping. What should I do?
They'll melt.

421
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,110
What else? We'll eat them all.

422
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,070
Thanks for this.

423
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,120
Enjoy.

424
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:49,790
I thank you too.

425
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:52,620
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

426
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,540
Hello.

427
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,920
Hey, Song. What are you doing?

428
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,800
It's time for Wing 2's bath.

429
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:04,590
They're freaking out
that we're not taking them.

430
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,260
Okay.

431
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,720
-Move quickly.
-Geez.

432
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:12,520
The poor guy can't even eat his ice cream.

433
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,730
He's quiet when he eats.

434
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,770
Okay, then.

435
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,650
What? Where are you going?

436
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,320
Shower.

437
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,410
I'm not sick at all anymore.

438
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,240
Please let me take a shower.

439
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,370
I want to take a shower.

440
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,000
I'm all better, doctor.

441
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,250
I'll take him.

442
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,380
Just let him go.

443
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:49,180
Sure. But you have to be careful.
You can't go in hot water yet.

444
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:52,640
Goodness. It's too hot for hot water.

445
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:57,980
Hurry up and change.
I'll take you to the shower room.

446
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:35,770
Seriously, he's so annoying.

447
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,310
What is that? Where did you get it?

448
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,770
Officer Song gave it to me.

449
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,450
He saved his life.
Coffee isn't a big deal.

450
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,410
Why didn't Han-yang stay in the infirmary?
What's so great about showering?

451
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:00,540
Right? What's so great about showering?
I don't get it.

452
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,880
In light of that, I will pass
on the shower today.

453
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,670
No shower today!

454
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,920
-Please!
-Please, wash up! Please!

455
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,590
Let us live too, please?

456
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:12,550
Geez. You scared me.

457
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,390
If you don't wash again today,
I'll break your legs.

458
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,560
I'll submit a formal complaint.

459
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:20,310
Screw you both.

460
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,310
Like you're so clean.

461
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,480
Crony doesn't wash that well either.

462
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:26,280
I don't care whether or not he...

463
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:02,480
It's okay. It's okay, Jung-woo.

464
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,370
I need to use the toilet.

465
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:20,160
Okay. Sure.

466
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,670
Yikes!

467
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,510
Min-chul.

468
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:35,720
I think I broke my back.

469
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,180
What do I do?

470
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,350
Min-chul, are you okay?

471
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,690
Oh no.

472
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,610
What do we do?

473
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:50,690
-Slowly. This way. Here.
-No.

474
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,710
Freeze. What are you doing?

475
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,010
I said to stop!

476
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:21,430
What do you take me for? Get over here!

477
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,440
Shit.

478
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:37,240
SEOBU PENITENTIARY

479
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:42,450
Nice! Good job, Je-hyeok.

480
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,580
His speed and control improved a lot.

481
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,210
He should be able to face
a batter or two with that.

482
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:51,000
That's right. He's capable of
at least a one-point relief.

483
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,050
If lucky, if he can do more,

484
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,380
he may be a middle reliever.

485
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:08,310
He almost made it into the major league,
but now...

486
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:10,940
hopes to be a middle relief.

487
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,800
-Lieutenant Lee.
-Yes?

488
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,260
Can you do the night inspections
for my wing tonight?

489
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,390
I need to go to the hospital.

490
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:44,180
Are you sick?

491
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:46,810
No. I have a medical checkup today.

492
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,850
Why don't you ask Lieutenant Paeng?

493
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,520
He worked two nights in a row.

494
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:53,610
You can't call him, okay?

495
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:56,030
-Fine.
-Thank you.

496
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,110
Oh yeah, Lieutenant Lee.

497
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,910
I heard reporters are calling
Je-hyeok Kim for interviews.

498
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:03,120
Shouldn't you become his manager as well?

499
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:05,370
Why is he suddenly doing interviews?

500
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:08,080
-There was that article.
-What?

501
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:09,670
Why is he suddenly doing interviews?

502
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:12,380
-There was that article.
-What?

503
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:16,090
Didn't you know? It just came out that
Je-hyeok Kim is playing baseball again.

504
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:19,350
That he changed his throwing arm to right,
and that he's doing rehab in prison.

505
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:23,140
The Internet's buzzing about that.
Je-hyeok is most trending.

506
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:27,520
I bet the warden was really disappointed.

507
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,690
He was saving that
for his favorite reporter Mr. Yong.

508
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:32,980
How did that get out?

509
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:36,530
True. There are so many people here.
It's surprising it didn't...

510
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,490
Do the inspection for me.

511
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,700
-I heard.
-How?

512
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:45,830
Min-chul sent me a message.

513
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,670
What do I do? The warden will flip out.

514
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:51,840
That was my first concern too.

515
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:56,510
We can worry about him later.
So? Will you do the interviews?

516
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:58,220
An inmate can't do interviews.

517
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,090
I should know my place.

518
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,260
I won't give interviews straight up,

519
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:05,350
but I don't want to avoid it.

520
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,640
I have to look into teams anyway.

521
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:10,770
If anyone will even take me.

522
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,110
Joon-ho.

523
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:17,530
What if no one calls?

524
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:20,360
What else? There's a way.

525
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:23,580
We'll call them first.

526
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:29,210
You still think you're on top.
Don't you get it yet?

527
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,800
If none of the teams calls you,

528
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:40,890
we'll call them.
If no one wants to sign you,

529
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:44,180
then we can beg and plead.
I'll go and beg.

530
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:46,720
I'll ask them to give Je-hyeok Kim a shot.

531
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,020
Saying that out loud...

532
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:56,610
It's crazy sad.

533
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,200
Joon-ho.

534
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,580
Try reading in times like that.

535
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,620
It helps if you cultivate the mind.

536
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,040
I've been...

537
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:18,010
reading <i>Holy Bible,</i>

538
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:20,630
<i>Heart Sutra,</i> the Conan,

539
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:22,800
and <i>Talmud</i> all together.

540
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:24,970
There are so many nice sayings.

541
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:28,310
There's this saying in the Conan.

542
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,690
"Allah protects them,

543
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,690
so do not go astray,

544
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,610
and do not pursue the greed

545
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:39,860
of the heart."

546
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:41,950
Shut up!

547
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:44,950
It's the <i>"Quran,"</i> not "Conan."
You ignorant bastard.

548
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,540
<i>Detective Conan.</i>

549
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,630
Get over here. I'll put you in your cell.

550
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:56,920
Yes, sir.

551
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,170
CELL 2B6

552
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,890
CELL 2B2

553
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,190
<i>Hello, inmates. You did great today.</i>

554
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:23,650
<i>We will now lock the cell gates.</i>

555
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,370
My goodness.

556
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:34,870
Is it because it's summer? They turned in,
but it's still bright outside.

557
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,040
What are you mumbling about alone?

558
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:41,550
What? Why are you on the second floor?

559
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:43,920
Don't you work on the first floor?

560
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:46,090
Song asked me to fill in.

561
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:47,600
Chief.

562
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,390
May I look over personal details
of Wing 2's inmates?

563
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:53,310
Why? Who? Whom do you want to know about?

564
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:56,060
I was just bored,
so I thought I'll flip through them.

565
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:18,790
<i>Hello?</i>

566
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,920
<i>Who is this?</i>

567
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:23,300
Hello. I'm sorry to call
suddenly like this.

568
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:26,050
I'm Officer Joon-ho Lee
from Seobu Penitentiary.

569
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:33,310
You're Tae-uk Kim's guardian, correct?

570
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:37,560
I'm calling because your brother
asked you to come visit.

571
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:40,650
He's been asking for you for a few weeks,

572
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:42,820
which is why I'm calling today.

573
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,900
<i>I'm sure I said to stop calling.</i>

574
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:51,950
<i>I'm in no position
to visit my brother, officer.</i>

575
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,200
<i>I don't have money to send
commissary money,</i>

576
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:56,410
<i>and I can't visit
because it's so far away.</i>

577
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,710
<i>I live paycheck to paycheck.</i>

578
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:03,670
<i>I told Lieutenant Paeng
several times already.</i>

579
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:10,260
<i>I really want to stop getting these calls.</i>

580
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:12,180
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

581
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:20,100
<i>I said to stop calling.</i>

582
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:21,560
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

583
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:23,190
I'm sorry.

584
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:27,110
Still, can't you come and see Tae-uk
just once?

585
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,860
He was asking for you all day again
until he fell asleep.

586
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,910
I'll pay for your transportation.

587
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:35,240
<i>Lieutenant Paeng.</i>

588
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:39,540
<i>I'm... I'm a despicable human being.</i>

589
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,590
<i>I don't deserve to be his sister.</i>

590
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:45,800
<i>I'm very sorry.</i>

591
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:49,550
<i>-I'm ashamed.</i>
-No, don't be.

592
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:51,340
I understand.

593
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,100
<i>My husband doesn't know.</i>

594
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:57,890
<i>My family doesn't know anything
about this.</i>

595
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:00,730
<i>I want to cut ties</i>

596
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:03,610
<i>with my brother.</i>

597
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:06,400
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

598
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:09,400
<i>I'm very sorry.</i>

599
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:22,000
Goodness...

600
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:26,630
You called again, didn't you?

601
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:36,260
Just tell Tae-uk
that his sister doesn't want to come.

602
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:39,600
Tell him you called her
more than 100 times, but she won't come.

603
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:43,940
Why are you letting him curse you out?
Just tell him the truth.

604
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:45,940
It's better to let him curse me out.

605
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:48,820
He asks for his sister all day long.

606
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,570
What if he finds out
that she doesn't want to see him?

607
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:55,030
Would you be able to carry on?

608
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,200
It's better for me to be cursed out.

609
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:05,790
True.

610
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:09,420
Being cursed out is your daily routine.

611
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:14,050
You'll be able to handle it
much better than anyone else.

612
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,640
Right?

613
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:20,020
You little bastard...

614
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:34,990
Are you sleepy? Geez.

615
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,540
Have some coffee.

616
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:42,830
It's worse because of the heat.
I'm so out of it.

617
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,580
Just sweat it out.

618
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:55,090
What?

619
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:00,140
Lieutenant Lee! Thanks!

620
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,980
I'm here, so you may go.

621
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:05,520
Okay, I will. Thanks.

622
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:09,860
What's gotten into you,
helping other officers like this?

623
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:12,780
Will wonders never cease?

624
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,040
He's such a prick.

625
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:25,460
I just can't like him. I just can't.

626
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,500
You're up? Don't you have work tomorrow?

627
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:33,550
Can't you see I'm working?

628
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:41,220
What is that?

629
00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:44,060
What else?

630
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:48,350
It's Gocheok Gunman's tearful
welcome back post to Je-hyeok Kim.

631
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:53,900
Why am I more excited than concerned about
his transformation from lefty to righty?

632
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:56,610
Hey. You're missing a line at the end.

633
00:46:58,030 --> 00:46:59,620
What? What's missing?

634
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:02,030
"Do you believe me?"

635
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:04,950
This isn't a column. It's a biography.

636
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:11,340
Are you jealous of Je-hyeok?

637
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:13,300
How petty.

638
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:16,130
You're petty. So petty.

639
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:00,260
Hey.

640
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:04,350
Come out.

641
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,430
Come out, you bastard.

642
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:17,150
Sorry.

643
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:18,570
It's okay.

644
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,660
Lieutenant Paeng.

645
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:31,000
-Sorry.
-I know.

646
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:34,460
If you were sick,
you should've stayed in the infirmary.

647
00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:36,090
Why, I ought to...

648
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:40,840
Did that bastard pick on you?

649
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:42,470
I can hear you.

650
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:44,930
Just kidding.

651
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:47,760
I...

652
00:48:48,890 --> 00:48:51,730
-Tomorrow is my visitation day.
-What?

653
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,560
I have a visit scheduled tomorrow.

654
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:57,440
What if they cancel it for being sick?

655
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:03,860
You can't cancel my visit for being sick,

656
00:49:04,530 --> 00:49:05,370
okay?

657
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:11,330
I wait all week long for that day.

658
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:15,540
What if they say I can't go
to my visitation

659
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:17,540
because I'm sick?

660
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:21,130
It's your lover, right? Ji-won Song?

661
00:49:22,590 --> 00:49:24,640
I thought it was someone else last time.

662
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:26,470
Was I wrong?

663
00:49:28,350 --> 00:49:30,020
Anyway, don't worry.

664
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,310
I'll carry you to the visitation room
if I have to.

665
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:36,900
-Thank you.
-Sure.

666
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,690
Now, I can

667
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:42,280
sleep in peace.

668
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:44,780
Thank you.

669
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:47,160
Lieutenant Paeng.

670
00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:48,330
Yes?

671
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:51,290
-I love you.
-Oh, my.

672
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,700
RULES OF CONDUCT

673
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,450
Only I didn't know.

674
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,370
Only I didn't know.

675
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:43,510
I thought I'm like your manager
and your big brother.

676
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:46,930
But only I didn't know, right?

677
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:49,140
Sorry.

678
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:53,640
I wanted to tell you first
once I got in shape.

679
00:50:55,730 --> 00:50:56,560
Sorry.

680
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:01,520
Sorry for not visiting for a while.

681
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:09,740
You look good. You're smiling too.
Is it because you can play again?

682
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:16,000
Je-hyeok. Don't worry about a thing.

683
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:19,790
I'll hit the ground running from now on.

684
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:24,420
I'll meet with all ten teams
and tell them you're still alive and well,

685
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:28,380
and that you can still throw well enough.

686
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:32,760
I'll make 100...
No, I'll make a million calls a day.

687
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:39,310
Forget your pride, okay?

688
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,480
They'll call, right?

689
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:46,190
Still,

690
00:51:46,610 --> 00:51:47,900
at least one team

691
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,530
will want to sign me, right?

692
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:50,860
Of course.

693
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:54,620
They'll call for sure. Don't worry.

694
00:52:07,510 --> 00:52:10,220
You should stay in bed if you're sick.

695
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:13,390
If you faint, you'd just be
a nuisance to the guards.

696
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:16,180
Please shut up, will you?

697
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:18,930
My head really hurts.

698
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,520
Han-yang, your lover
is really hanging in there.

699
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:23,610
Most couples break up after coming here.

700
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:26,320
-Don't you have someone?
-I'm not interested.

701
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:29,190
Girls aren't interested in you either.

702
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,700
Why you little...

703
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:34,200
Wow... You guys fight a lot.

704
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:36,540
At least you won't be bored in here.

705
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:38,870
It's nice to have friends.

706
00:52:39,450 --> 00:52:43,790
We aren't friends. I'm older.
My parents just registered me late.

707
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:47,920
I'm even older than you.

708
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:51,130
Mentally, I'm 50 years old.

709
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:53,890
-You're so immature.
-You're more immature.

710
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:57,640
Both of you are immature.
You're like little kids.

711
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:04,270
Let's go in.

712
00:53:11,490 --> 00:53:12,320
What?

713
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:21,830
Enough already.

714
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:25,420
How does your IQ drop by ten every day
ever since you got here?

715
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,750
-It's because of that bastard.
-Don't blame Han-yang. You're the same.

716
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:33,090
Go in already.
Your brother must be waiting. Go.

717
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,770
Are you sick? You look terrible.

718
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:53,700
I'm very well. I'm very healthy.

719
00:53:55,490 --> 00:53:57,370
I haven't taken drugs in...

720
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,710
Okay, okay. I believe you.

721
00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:05,250
I mean it.

722
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:07,880
I haven't taken drugs
in over three months.

723
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:11,420
Good job. That's great.

724
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:18,180
I love you.

725
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:23,180
I said I love you.

726
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:31,650
Is it funny that I love you?

727
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:38,200
You say things like that

728
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:39,870
so easily.

729
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:40,990
Yeah.

730
00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:44,160
It's my only virtue.

731
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:47,460
I'm always true to my feelings,

732
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:51,000
unlike you.

733
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:54,840
Is that why you do drugs?

734
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,170
I said I quit.

735
00:54:58,720 --> 00:54:59,720
I mean it.

736
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:01,260
Believe me.

737
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:05,310
I won't take drugs again. I won't.

738
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:06,850
So,

739
00:55:07,730 --> 00:55:09,980
you have to come visit me

740
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:12,190
once a week.

741
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:15,740
Okay?

742
00:55:24,410 --> 00:55:27,330
UI JUNIOR HIGH
42TH REUNION

743
00:55:27,410 --> 00:55:31,710
December 31, 2009

744
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:38,840
Han-yang, you're such a punk.

745
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:40,640
Why am I a punk?

746
00:55:41,090 --> 00:55:43,470
You wouldn't come to any of the reunions.

747
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:46,770
You came today
because Ji-won's coming, right?

748
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:48,850
No.

749
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:52,610
I came because I haven't seen you guys
in a while.

750
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:54,150
Like hell you did.

751
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:58,780
You look much better
now that you live in Gangnam.

752
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,910
Do you think Ji-won will make it?

753
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:02,240
He lands at 10 p.m.

754
00:56:03,070 --> 00:56:04,370
Wouldn't he go straight home?

755
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:07,620
Ji-won may not come.

756
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:09,870
What will you do?

757
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:12,750
I came to see you guys.

758
00:56:12,830 --> 00:56:15,670
Like we'd fall for that, asshole.

759
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,260
I texted to ask where he was,
but he didn't respond.

760
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:24,300
<i>-Landing.
-Hurry up.</i>

761
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:26,260
<i>-In cab.
-Hurry up.</i>

762
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:27,930
<i>Chill. I'm coming.</i>

763
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:29,480
<i>-Where are you?
-Near Jamsil.</i>

764
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:32,770
<i>Hurry up. Come on. Hurry up!</i>

765
00:56:32,850 --> 00:56:35,070
How long has Ji-won been gone?

766
00:56:35,610 --> 00:56:38,360
He emigrated when we were 17,
so five, six years?

767
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:39,360
<i>Almost there.</i>

768
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:46,240
-Where are you going?
-He's almost here. I'll go get him.

769
00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:48,500
Okay.

770
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:52,000
Hey, guys.

771
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:54,540
Those guys...

772
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:55,880
No, right?

773
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,550
What are you talking about?

774
00:57:01,010 --> 00:57:03,890
No way. They're close, that's all.

775
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:05,760
What are you saying, you bastard?

776
00:57:05,850 --> 00:57:08,430
Han-yang hasn't seen Ji-won
since he moved to the States either.

777
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,730
That's right. Are you nuts?

778
00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:12,020
Don't drink too much today.

779
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:39,800
Hey, Han-yang.

780
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:42,590
You look the same.

781
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:46,970
You were texting me like crazy
to hurry up. What's wrong with you?

782
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:53,060
It's been a while. How have you been?

783
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:55,600
It's cold. Where is it?

784
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,980
-Everyone must be drunk.
-It's just around the corner.

785
00:57:59,070 --> 00:58:02,110
-You look like you've lost weight.
-I lost a lot.

786
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:03,740
I worked out like crazy.

787
00:58:03,990 --> 00:58:05,740
-Aren't you cold?
-I am.

788
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:07,990
Let's hurry.

789
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:09,620
Wow.

790
00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:17,750
Do you know what this punk said?

791
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:19,670
Don't. Don't tell them.

792
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:20,880
"Hey, guys.

793
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:22,920
They're not, right?

794
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:24,630
They're not dating, right?"

795
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,340
What are you saying? Freaks.

796
00:58:27,930 --> 00:58:29,850
It's because Han-yang cares
only about you.

797
00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:32,640
God... You asshole.

798
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:34,810
He never showed up once,

799
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,940
but once he heard you were coming today,

800
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:40,940
he got here before they even opened.

801
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:45,070
Of course not.

802
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:47,660
Not Ji-won.

803
00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:50,080
However,

804
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:52,790
I don't know about him.

805
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:55,790
I don't know about him.

806
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:58,830
You're drunk. You punks are totally drunk.

807
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:02,250
The truth is,

808
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:05,550
I'm interested.

809
00:59:07,590 --> 00:59:09,680
If Ji-won asks me out,

810
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:12,560
I'm interested.

811
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:19,940
Seriously.

812
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:20,860
Drink.

813
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:26,360
Excuse me! Can you change the music?

814
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:29,240
Enough with the ballads!

815
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:32,780
It's New Year's Eve.
Don't you have anything fun?

816
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:35,870
Okay!

817
00:59:39,790 --> 00:59:41,040
Drink! Cheers!

818
00:59:43,170 --> 00:59:45,340
-Cheers.
-Clink.

819
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:46,880
She's my type.

820
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,100
She's pretty.

821
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:08,360
Hey. Drink.

822
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:10,320
Drink.

823
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:13,740
-That's enough.
-Shit.

824
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:15,990
Whom did you see in the army?

825
01:00:16,830 --> 01:00:19,330
I didn't go to the army.

826
01:00:19,410 --> 01:00:21,880
-Shit.
-Whatever.

827
01:00:37,270 --> 01:00:40,060
Are you waiting? I guess so, right?

828
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:42,980
Sorry.

829
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:56,280
Did you drink a lot?

830
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:22,690
Hey, guys. It's the countdown!

831
01:01:24,150 --> 01:01:25,650
-10!
-Should we go?

832
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:30,900
-9! 8! 7! 6!
-9! 8! 7! 6!

833
01:01:30,990 --> 01:01:37,370
-5! 4! 3! 2! 1!
-5! 4! 3! 2! 1!

834
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:40,250
-Happy New Year!
-Happy New Year!

835
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:46,250
-Happy New Year!
-Happy New Year!

836
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,800
Happy New Year!

837
01:01:58,470 --> 01:02:00,010
The store got a new shipment.

838
01:02:02,430 --> 01:02:04,480
They'll sell anything to make money.

839
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:09,190
Je-hyeok is still in the greenhouse,
right?

840
01:02:10,110 --> 01:02:12,280
-Is he okay?
-He's very okay.

841
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:14,070
That loser.

842
01:02:14,650 --> 01:02:16,490
He talked like he'd kill him right away.

843
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:29,130
Hey. Je-hyeok may finish
serving his term at this rate.

844
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,970
How will you get him with a toothbrush?

845
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:37,340
-What's your labor assignment?
-I don't have one yet.

846
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:40,850
You're in maintenance, right?

847
01:02:41,850 --> 01:02:44,520
Swipe a tool for him to use.

848
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:46,600
He'll never get it done otherwise.

849
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:51,110
What a loser.

850
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:55,320
When will you get him
if you hesitate like that?

851
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:58,450
You're such a coward.

852
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:01,530
What are you doing there?

853
01:03:04,370 --> 01:03:06,000
Disperse, please!

854
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:09,880
I said to disperse!

855
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:12,420
Don't you hear me?

856
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:15,760
I said to split up!

857
01:03:36,690 --> 01:03:37,990
What are you staring at?

858
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:41,200
You shithead.

859
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:46,250
What? Want to hit me?

860
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:48,660
Hit me, asshole.

861
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:52,290
You don't have the balls to hit a guard.

862
01:04:04,430 --> 01:04:05,930
That loser.

863
01:04:22,370 --> 01:04:24,160
-I have a wish.
-No.

864
01:04:27,370 --> 01:04:30,370
Go to the hospital with me
next Saturday afternoon.

865
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:35,550
What kind of a dialogue is this?

866
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,210
Are you pregnant?

867
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:41,880
No. When I went for my checkup,
I couldn't get an endoscopy.

868
01:04:41,970 --> 01:04:45,180
Next Saturday was the only availability,
but I need a guardian present.

869
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:48,270
Then go with a guardian. Why should I go?

870
01:04:48,390 --> 01:04:49,520
Don't you have family?

871
01:04:50,310 --> 01:04:51,350
I'm an orphan.

872
01:04:54,230 --> 01:04:58,030
I have no friends either. Since I started
this job, I never had time to meet them,

873
01:04:58,110 --> 01:04:59,690
so they drifted apart from me long ago.

874
01:05:02,990 --> 01:05:06,580
Okay. I won't get an endoscopy this year.
I'll get it next year.

875
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:10,080
No. They say I can't get
a regular endoscopy

876
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,830
and need to be put under,
but I have no family or friends,

877
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:16,290
and colleagues won't go,
so I'll never get an endoscopy.

878
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:19,880
If I develop a problem
with my stomach or intestine,

879
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:22,050
I'll say it's because my colleague
wouldn't...

880
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:25,180
Okay, fine. I'll go. Let's go.

881
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:27,350
Don't do that.

882
01:05:27,930 --> 01:05:29,220
Don't do that. I don't like that.

883
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:32,230
Don't do that. I said to stop it.

884
01:05:32,810 --> 01:05:35,270
I don't like it. I said I don't like it.

885
01:05:35,650 --> 01:05:36,560
But, I like it.

886
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:38,360
Why is your hand so ugly?

887
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:40,190
What? What do you mean?

888
01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:56,420
I think it'll work.

889
01:05:57,340 --> 01:05:58,250
Give it to him then.

890
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:01,380
I can't get it now since we're out here.

891
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:03,880
Yesterday,

892
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:07,180
I went to fix a fan in the woodshop,

893
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:10,810
and there were tons of paint thinner
in the corner.

894
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:15,140
I think they bought them to use
for paint jobs. There's more than enough.

895
01:06:15,730 --> 01:06:18,150
They won't notice if I steal a couple.

896
01:06:19,730 --> 01:06:21,860
When are you going back there?

897
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:25,400
Exercise time is over!
Head to your labor locations!

898
01:06:26,490 --> 01:06:27,320
Now.

899
01:06:28,490 --> 01:06:31,120
If we're lucky, I'll give it to you
later this afternoon.

900
01:06:32,330 --> 01:06:34,210
Just get the money ready, punk.

901
01:07:01,270 --> 01:07:03,230
Throw this away.

902
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:05,400
You may leave it by the incinerator
out back.

903
01:07:05,990 --> 01:07:07,280
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

904
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:14,200
-I don't need to go, do I?
-No.

905
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:30,550
You go with him.

906
01:07:58,790 --> 01:08:00,670
Hey. I want to buy some cigarettes.

907
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:04,300
Now? Officer Kang is in there.

908
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:06,670
You can sneak them out.

909
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:10,180
I'll wait outside the greenhouse.
Hurry up.

910
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:12,680
Boss wants it now, that's why.

911
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:14,680
I'll give ten transportation cards.

912
01:08:15,390 --> 01:08:16,970
-For real?
-Yeah.

913
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:11,490
Where's Je-hyeok?

914
01:09:11,570 --> 01:09:13,570
He's taking out the trash.

915
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:15,700
He went alone?

916
01:09:16,330 --> 01:09:18,580
I sent the guy who runs the store.

917
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:19,660
Ouch.

918
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:22,870
Why is that punk here?

919
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:32,590
He'll be okay alone, right?

920
01:09:32,970 --> 01:09:36,470
Yes. Lifer is there too. He'll be fine.

921
01:09:38,010 --> 01:09:40,470
Anyway, I heard that

922
01:09:40,730 --> 01:09:43,940
Lifer killed more people
than anyone here at Seobu.

923
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:45,690
Is that true?

924
01:09:46,190 --> 01:09:50,320
That's right. That Lifer gramps
killed four people, right?

925
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:52,150
Who's "Lifer"?

926
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:54,740
You know,
the one who always looks pissed off.

927
01:09:55,030 --> 01:09:59,030
He used to work in the woodshop,
but now he burns trash in the incinerator.

928
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:00,950
I've never seen him smile.

929
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:03,790
Most people at least smirk when I talk.

930
01:10:03,870 --> 01:10:06,420
But I never see him smile.

931
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,630
Will he really be okay?

932
01:10:08,710 --> 01:10:11,340
I heard Lifer killed people

933
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:13,300
and gouge their eyes out.

934
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:16,720
I never heard that before. Is that true?

935
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:21,600
Is that true?

936
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:25,140
Yes. He hit them with a hammer
and killed them,

937
01:10:25,690 --> 01:10:27,940
and then gouge their eyes out.

938
01:11:12,650 --> 01:11:15,610
INCINERATOR

939
01:11:19,370 --> 01:11:21,370
INCINERATOR

940
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:16,550
Sir!

941
01:12:20,890 --> 01:12:22,090
Sir!

942
01:12:22,430 --> 01:12:24,430
Call the office and ask for backup.

943
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:27,890
Emergency. Fire in the incinerator.

944
01:12:27,980 --> 01:12:29,600
Need backup.

945
01:12:29,690 --> 01:12:31,400
-There's a person inside.
-What?

946
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:34,400
-Where's the hydrant?
-It's far away. It'll take time.

947
01:12:34,820 --> 01:12:36,940
Fire extinguisher.
There should be a fire extinguisher.

948
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:18,360
My Je-hee.

949
01:13:18,610 --> 01:13:21,820
How did you know
I could talk right this instant?

950
01:13:22,660 --> 01:13:24,160
<i>You have the morning shift, right?</i>

951
01:13:24,740 --> 01:13:27,030
Yeah. I'm about to leave.

952
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:30,410
Your brother is doing well.

953
01:13:30,910 --> 01:13:34,330
He's taking his herbal tonic,
and training well.

954
01:13:36,210 --> 01:13:38,420
<i>Don't let him work out too much.</i>

955
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,090
<i>He works out like crazy when he trains.</i>

956
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:43,760
Yes, ma'am.

957
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:45,760
<i>Also,</i>

958
01:13:45,930 --> 01:13:48,850
<i>what are you doing
next Saturday afternoon?</i>

959
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:52,940
<i>Your brother said you have
morning shifts for a while.</i>

960
01:13:53,810 --> 01:13:56,520
I already have a plan that day.

961
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:58,270
<i>With whom?</i>

962
01:13:58,650 --> 01:14:01,900
Officer Song. He's a junior guard.

963
01:14:01,990 --> 01:14:04,700
I agreed to go with him to his endoscopy.

964
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:06,030
<i>Do you have to go?</i>

965
01:14:07,950 --> 01:14:09,080
I promised.

966
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:12,290
I feel kind of sorry for the kid.

967
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:16,210
<i>Lieutenant Lee.
Please come to the incinerator. Quickly.</i>

968
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:22,840
I said he's fine. Sit down.

969
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:25,760
Sit down.

970
01:14:29,850 --> 01:14:33,230
Lifer would never harm anyone.

971
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:37,600
He wants to die every day
and barely carries on.

972
01:14:40,150 --> 01:14:41,280
That man

973
01:14:42,190 --> 01:14:44,490
was an executive at a large corporation,

974
01:14:45,990 --> 01:14:47,780
but as soon as his daughter
started college,

975
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:51,620
she went to some sort of a trip

976
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:53,870
with her club members,

977
01:14:55,750 --> 01:14:56,750
and was gang raped.

978
01:14:58,170 --> 01:14:59,880
There were four of them.

979
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:02,920
The daughter committed suicide,

980
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:06,180
and his wife also committed suicide
from the trauma.

981
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:07,800
Oh, my.

982
01:15:08,390 --> 01:15:10,720
Those jerks were all
from wealthy families.

983
01:15:11,350 --> 01:15:15,520
One of them was a son of a chairman
of a well-known company.

984
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:18,230
They did a horrible thing to her.

985
01:15:18,810 --> 01:15:20,860
They destroyed an entire family,

986
01:15:22,780 --> 01:15:24,530
but one of them got off with probation,

987
01:15:24,990 --> 01:15:27,360
and the other three got
less than a year in jail.

988
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:30,410
So,

989
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:33,290
how do you think Lifer's life was?

990
01:15:35,250 --> 01:15:39,790
As soon as they got out,
he went to kill them with a hammer.

991
01:15:41,090 --> 01:15:42,340
Why did he gouge their eyes out?

992
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:44,630
Why did he do that?

993
01:15:46,050 --> 01:15:47,260
For his daughter.

994
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:52,890
They'll meet his daughter again
in the afterlife.

995
01:15:53,510 --> 01:15:55,140
He didn't want them to recognize her.

996
01:15:57,770 --> 01:16:00,940
He was afraid they'd harass her
even in the afterlife.

997
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:02,940
That's why he did it.

998
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:08,150
Would you be able to smile?

999
01:16:08,780 --> 01:16:09,700
Would you?

1000
01:16:09,780 --> 01:16:13,410
Would you be able to smile
after going through that?

1001
01:16:17,290 --> 01:16:20,170
HOPEFUL REFORM

1002
01:16:43,190 --> 01:16:44,770
Why did you save me?

1003
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:47,230
You should've let me die.

1004
01:16:50,110 --> 01:16:52,990
Why did you save me?

1005
01:16:58,410 --> 01:17:00,910
I need to die to see my daughter.

1006
01:17:02,790 --> 01:17:06,300
I need to die to see my daughter again!

1007
01:17:11,630 --> 01:17:12,890
My...

1008
01:17:23,190 --> 01:17:25,520
What are you doing? Carry him.

1009
01:17:28,860 --> 01:17:30,740
Je-hyeok Kim. Are you okay?

1010
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:32,860
I'm fine.

1011
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:39,700
What happened?

1012
01:17:39,950 --> 01:17:41,910
I think someone set fire
to the incinerator.

1013
01:17:42,750 --> 01:17:45,040
-We'll check the surveillance video.
-What?

1014
01:18:02,980 --> 01:18:03,810
Hello.

1015
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:18,830
I'll do it.

1016
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:35,430
Put this on.

1017
01:18:36,010 --> 01:18:37,390
The back of your shirt is worn out.

1018
01:18:41,350 --> 01:18:44,230
If you don't want to wear it,
burn it with the rest.

1019
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:57,240
I'm going to take a piss out back.

1020
01:19:31,730 --> 01:19:33,110
Lieutenant Lee.

1021
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:36,450
I'd like an autonomous pass.

1022
01:19:43,330 --> 01:19:44,710
Lieutenant Lee.

1023
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:48,050
I'd like an autonomous pass.

1024
01:19:49,210 --> 01:19:53,010
IF AN INMATE HAS AN AUTONOMOUS PASS,
HE CAN MOVE ABOUT WITHIN THE FACILITY

1025
01:19:53,090 --> 01:19:55,260
WITHOUT A GUARD'S ACCOMPANIMENT

1026
01:19:55,340 --> 01:19:56,180
Okay.

1027
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:00,350
I'll take full responsibility.

1028
01:20:56,410 --> 01:20:57,610
Should we go there?

1029
01:21:06,670 --> 01:21:08,460
-Is someone inside?
-Sorry?

1030
01:21:08,670 --> 01:21:09,630
Is someone inside?

1031
01:21:10,210 --> 01:21:11,590
Yes. How did you know?

1032
01:21:13,260 --> 01:21:14,920
Does he look like...

1033
01:21:15,010 --> 01:21:18,470
The bald guy was throwing up in the yard,

1034
01:21:18,550 --> 01:21:20,550
so I asked if he was okay,

1035
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:23,470
and he asked if he could wash up.
So, I brought him here.

1036
01:21:50,460 --> 01:21:51,500
Je-hyeok.

1037
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:02,600
I'll do it, okay?

1038
01:22:29,330 --> 01:22:30,370
You fucking shit.

1039
01:22:40,470 --> 01:22:41,510
That's enough.

1040
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:48,430
Je-hyeok. Stop it.

1041
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:49,940
That's enough!

1042
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:51,980
-Hey!
-This bastard needs more beating.

1043
01:22:52,060 --> 01:22:54,560
-Stop it.
-He's still fine! You shit!

1044
01:22:54,770 --> 01:22:56,270
Stop acting, asshole!

1045
01:22:56,860 --> 01:22:58,570
-Je-hyeok, please!
-Let go!

1046
01:22:58,650 --> 01:23:00,740
-Stop it!
-I'm going to kill this bastard.

1047
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:04,120
-I'll kill this asshole!
-Stop!

1048
01:23:05,530 --> 01:23:06,870
Hey. Je-hyeok.

1049
01:23:07,410 --> 01:23:09,750
-Stop it!
-Asshole. Get over here.

Kimchi fried rice.

1061
01:23:40,110 --> 01:23:43,990
It's summer. Can't they make
cold noodles or something?

1062

Well, it's just...

You didn't eat yet, did you?

1080
01:25:08,030 --> 01:25:09,910
Lieutenant Paeng
brought me kimchi fried rice.

1081
01:25:13,910 --> 01:25:16,670
Joon-ho, I won't be here for life, will I?

1082
01:25:17,370 --> 01:25:18,290
Why you...

1083
01:25:20,210 --> 01:25:22,750
That little... How can you laugh?

1084
01:25:26,930 --> 01:25:29,010
Since Crony instigated it,

1085
01:25:29,220 --> 01:25:31,010
that will be considered.

1086
01:25:31,850 --> 01:25:35,770
And luckily, the guard from the shower
testified nicely for you.

1087
01:25:36,430 --> 01:25:40,270
His testimony was very favorable
toward you.

He's good-looking too.

You almost killed Crony.

1091

1100
01:26:29,070 --> 01:26:30,780
You almost hurt your right hand,

01:26:30,860 --> 01:26:32,740
extended your sentence,

Oh, my. So, you like flowers.

1107

Leave. I'll take Je-hyeok Kim
to the infirmary.

1108
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:57,930
He's my inmate from my wing.
Please stick to the rules.

1109

When? This Saturday? Endoscopy?

1110
01:27:06,780 --> 01:27:08,190
Must I really do this?

1111
01:27:09,190 --> 01:27:11,780
Can't a fan do that for his star?

1112
01:27:12,700 --> 01:27:15,240
Are you sure that's wild rose?

1113
01:27:15,330 --> 01:27:18,080
Yes. The greenhouse gave it to me.
Whom is it for?

1114
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Let's go.

1115
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:25,460
Like this. Okay. Good, good.

1116
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:28,590
You must've hit him properly.

1117
01:27:29,170 --> 01:27:31,590
Still, you should always be careful.
Let me see.

1118
01:27:36,430 --> 01:27:39,560
-Can we talk outside...
-What? Me?

1119
01:27:40,140 --> 01:27:42,100
Why? Are you hurt?

1120
01:27:42,190 --> 01:27:43,480
Well, everything aches...

1121
01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:46,650
Gosh. It's because
you don't exercise enough.

1122
01:27:46,730 --> 01:27:49,150
You can't hurt your back.
You're not even married.

1123
01:28:06,330 --> 01:28:08,630
Why don't you want to live?

1124
01:28:11,010 --> 01:28:13,430
It's so discouraging to the person
who saved you.

1125
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:22,730
I heard from Min-chul

1126

1127
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:27,360

Do you think your daughter would be happy

1129
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:37,820
to see you like this?

1130
01:28:49,090 --> 01:28:50,500
It's wild rose.

1131
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:02,100
This flower means...

1132
01:29:08,610 --> 01:29:10,110
"I miss

1133
01:29:11,980 --> 01:29:13,570
the cottage on a hill

1134
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:20,660
in my home country down south,

1135
01:29:21,700 --> 01:29:23,870
where wild roses bloom."

1136
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:26,080
Isn't that a song?

1137
01:29:28,370 --> 01:29:29,380
How did you know?

1138
01:29:36,260 --> 01:29:37,800
Okay, then.

1139
01:29:48,730 --> 01:29:50,310
<i>What does poppy mean?</i>

1140
01:29:51,270 --> 01:29:52,360
Looney?

1141
01:29:56,860 --> 01:29:58,150
Looney should be okay, right?

1142
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:03,410
What is this flower?

1143
01:30:05,290 --> 01:30:07,120
-It's wild rose.
-I see.

1144
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:11,250
Wild rose means...

1145
01:30:15,590 --> 01:30:17,880
"Solitude, cautious love."

1146
01:30:19,220 --> 01:30:20,430
And...

1147
01:30:23,180 --> 01:30:24,430
"Longing for family."

1148
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:30,100
Do you want to take it?

1149
01:30:31,020 --> 01:30:32,400
No, thank you.

1150
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:34,650
I'll look at it here.

1151
01:30:37,190 --> 01:30:38,740
It's pretty.

1152
01:30:46,790 --> 01:30:48,080
<i>RECONCILIATION
FORGIVENESS</i>

1153
01:30:48,870 --> 01:30:50,080
Are you throwing these away?

1154
01:30:51,210 --> 01:30:52,540
Yeah, throw them out.

1155
01:30:54,170 --> 01:30:55,710
Je-hyeok, what's your sign?

1156
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:57,260
I'm a rabbit.

1157
01:30:59,420 --> 01:31:01,760
Let's see.

1158
01:31:02,140 --> 01:31:04,970
"What you want desperately will happen,

1159
01:31:05,890 --> 01:31:07,810
and you'll receive good news"?

1160
01:31:08,390 --> 01:31:10,100
Good news? A woman?

1161
01:31:11,850 --> 01:31:13,230
Good news for Je-hyeok would be...

1162
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:18,570
Je-hyeok, visitation.

1163
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:20,190
It's your attorney.

1164
01:31:35,670 --> 01:31:36,500
Je-hyeok.

1165
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:38,840
Are you ready?

1166
01:31:40,630 --> 01:31:43,220
Just tell me. I'm fine.

1167
01:31:44,010 --> 01:31:45,640
Good news, bad news,

1168
01:31:47,010 --> 01:31:48,310
I'm ready for both.

1169
01:31:52,310 --> 01:31:56,400
I called all ten teams
after coming to see you,

1170
01:31:56,770 --> 01:31:57,980
and I met with them all.

1171
01:32:02,950 --> 01:32:04,030
All ten teams...

1172
01:32:09,080 --> 01:32:10,660
want to sign you.

1173
01:32:13,410 --> 01:32:14,920
Even Nexen.

1174
01:32:23,420 --> 01:32:24,680
You did well, Je-hyeok.

1175
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:33,890
Let's start over

1176
01:32:35,100 --> 01:32:36,650
like when we first met.

1177
01:32:52,910 --> 01:32:53,960
<i>Je-hyeok?</i>

1178
01:32:55,210 --> 01:32:56,500
<i>It's you, isn't it?</i>

1179
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:02,630
If you were going to call like this,
why did you break up with me?

1180
01:33:04,260 --> 01:33:07,180
We broke up. Wake up.

1181
01:34:02,230 --> 01:34:04,280
<i>Where is our Je-hyeok Kim going?</i>

1182
01:34:04,940 --> 01:34:05,820
<i>On what terms?</i>

1183
01:34:05,900 --> 01:34:08,240
Hey, Je-hyeok Kim!
Buy dinner once you sign with a team.

1184
01:34:08,990 --> 01:34:12,070
-Good luck.
-You didn't even sign yet.

1185
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:13,370
<i>Are there any terms you want?</i>

1186
01:34:13,450 --> 01:34:15,500
Want me to bury Je-hyeok Kim for you?

1187
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:19,120
He went through so much, and was wronged.

1188
01:34:19,210 --> 01:34:21,040
<i>He can say that much.</i>

1189
01:34:21,130 --> 01:34:22,170
<i>Je-hyeok.</i>

1190
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:28,010
-What happened to his hair?
-Han-yang...

1191
01:34:28,090 --> 01:34:30,720
<i>Looney's cute.
Why do you hate him so much?</i>

1192
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:34,100
-Just get treated, bastard.
-I am, bastard.

1193
01:34:36,470 --> 01:34:37,980
<i>-In the summer
-Aren't you hot?</i>

1194
01:34:38,060 --> 01:34:39,190
I'm cold.

1195
01:34:39,270 --> 01:34:42,440
<i>It's withdrawal. Please understand.</i>

1196
01:34:42,940 --> 01:34:46,230
<i>Jung-woo, help him out. You're friends.</i>

1197
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:47,570
You'll be there, right?

1198
01:34:47,650 --> 01:34:49,650
If you quit. It's up to you.

1199
01:34:49,740 --> 01:34:52,160
<i>Is he really trying to quit?
It'll be impossible.</i>

1200
01:34:52,240 --> 01:34:54,990
<i>He's being treated and stuff too,
so he'll be cured.</i>

1201
01:34:55,490 --> 01:34:57,500
<i>To be honest, I'm not sure.</i>

1202
01:34:58,870 --> 01:35:02,710
<i>He neglects his duties,
jokes around with the inmates...</i>

1203
01:35:02,790 --> 01:35:05,090
<i>Lieutenant Paeng is delinquent
and emotional.</i>

1204
01:35:05,170 --> 01:35:08,300
<i>Hey, Kang! What's that smoke in Wing 5A?</i>

1205
01:35:08,380 --> 01:35:10,010
<i>Lieutenant! Fire!</i>

1206
01:35:10,090 --> 01:35:13,090
<i>Fire. Fire. A fire has broken out.</i>

1207
01:35:13,680 --> 01:35:17,310
<i>Please follow the guards' instructions
and escape quickly.</i>

1208
01:35:17,430 --> 01:35:20,230
<i>Over 50 inmates died,
and there were numerous injured.</i>

1209
01:35:20,810 --> 01:35:23,940
-What are you doing?
<i>-He finally caused trouble.</i>

1210
01:35:24,020 --> 01:35:25,650
<i>Transfer Lieutenant Paeng elsewhere.</i>
