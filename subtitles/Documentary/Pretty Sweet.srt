00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:15,221
<i>Episode 15</i>

3
00:01:05,512 --> 00:01:09,421
Everything's in there. Who I
am, why I lived this way.

4
00:01:09,422 --> 00:01:13,961
Please listen to it, write an article, and
incorporate it to your 20th anniversary issue.

5
00:01:13,962 --> 00:01:18,741
So... you're saying that you're the
famous anonymous novel author Ten,

6
00:01:18,742 --> 00:01:23,621
and that you'll reveal it all to the world
through an interview with The Most. Is that it?

7
00:01:23,622 --> 00:01:25,452
Bingo!

8
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:30,132
It's possible that you wouldn't believe me.

9
00:01:31,962 --> 00:01:34,402
You've seen it a lot
somewhere, haven't you?

10
00:01:37,492 --> 00:01:41,591
The handwriting and mechanical
pencil are the same.

11
00:01:41,592 --> 00:01:45,321
Shouldn't that much evidence suffice?

12
00:01:45,322 --> 00:01:47,131
What else should I show you...

13
00:01:47,132 --> 00:01:51,222
Then, are you the one who stopped
the binding of the magazine?

14
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:56,022
You can write the article
by listening to that.

15
00:01:57,822 --> 00:01:59,482
Take some pictures.

16
00:02:00,332 --> 00:02:03,312
There have to be several
pictures to make an impact.

17
00:02:05,432 --> 00:02:07,201
- Feature Director Kim...
- Please take a good one.

18
00:02:07,202 --> 00:02:09,951
I even shaved to look good for the picture.

19
00:02:09,952 --> 00:02:11,682
Smile.

20
00:02:12,812 --> 00:02:14,841
What's your reason for
revealing who you are?

21
00:02:14,842 --> 00:02:17,611
Is it to keep the Most
from being discontinued?

22
00:02:17,612 --> 00:02:23,101
Hey... just take a picture. Jeez.

23
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:25,552
I'll take a selfie.

24
00:02:35,682 --> 00:02:38,411
Sheesh, I look better in person.

25
00:02:38,412 --> 00:02:41,171
Photoshop it for me, so
that it looks Most-like.

26
00:02:41,172 --> 00:02:45,592
There has to be a reason why you
kept it a secret for so long.

27
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:52,091
Nothing stays a secret
forever in this world.

28
00:02:52,092 --> 00:02:56,411
If it's going to be revealed, I wish for
it to be revealed in a Most-like way.

29
00:02:56,412 --> 00:03:01,202
I also wonder if there'll ever be
a better timing than this one.

30
00:03:05,562 --> 00:03:10,291
- But still, why are you going to this extent...
Weren't you an exact person when it came to business?

31
00:03:10,292 --> 00:03:14,552
If you're like this, then it takes away
the reason why I asked you to come.

32
00:03:15,782 --> 00:03:18,331
I was going to ask Jackson at first.

33
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:21,441
Oh, when you listen to it,
you might feel a bit upset.

34
00:03:21,442 --> 00:03:25,721
I recorded it thinking I was talking
to Jackson, so I spoke informally.

35
00:03:25,722 --> 00:03:28,331
I'd hate for other people
to chat about my story.

36
00:03:28,332 --> 00:03:33,461
But if it were Jackson... No, Hye
Jin, I thought it'd be okay.

37
00:03:33,462 --> 00:03:37,331
But as you know, she's just too nice.

38
00:03:37,332 --> 00:03:41,301
It was obvious that she wouldn't be able to
reveal it, and would be suffering on her own.

39
00:03:41,302 --> 00:03:43,532
So I called you.

40
00:03:44,982 --> 00:03:47,412
- Feature Director Kim.
- Please write an article.

41
00:03:48,232 --> 00:03:50,571
Let's be number one.

42
00:03:50,572 --> 00:03:54,802
Let's save the Most. Then nobody...

43
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,002
will have a reason to cry.

44
00:04:02,292 --> 00:04:04,871
If I reveal it...

45
00:04:04,872 --> 00:04:06,971
what will happen to you?

46
00:04:06,972 --> 00:04:11,752
What you're doing, won't
it change your life?

47
00:04:13,242 --> 00:04:17,111
Well, it will be quite a fuss for a while
at first, but that will die down quickly.

48
00:04:17,112 --> 00:04:20,152
I don't mind it. I'm okay.

49
00:04:23,572 --> 00:04:25,181
Still, this...

50
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,042
I'll count on you.

51
00:04:28,212 --> 00:04:33,432
I absolutely wish the first article
about me to be done by The Most.

52
00:04:34,172 --> 00:04:35,602
Absolutely.

53
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,232
Feature Director Kim.

54
00:04:49,332 --> 00:04:50,831
Wow.

55
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,451
No but this, this...

56
00:04:53,452 --> 00:04:56,761
Does this make sense? Does
this situation make sense?

57
00:04:56,762 --> 00:04:58,711
How is it that I'm not feeling bad at all?

58
00:04:58,712 --> 00:05:00,911
Sunbae Poong Ho is the
vice president? Heol.

59
00:05:00,912 --> 00:05:03,031
- What's going on? - It doesn't make sense.

60
00:05:03,032 --> 00:05:04,631
Earlier, I thought I was seeing a ghost.

61
00:05:04,632 --> 00:05:07,261
Me too. This doesn't make any sense.

62
00:05:07,262 --> 00:05:09,462
Ciao!

63
00:05:15,122 --> 00:05:20,271
You... you... I mean, Vice-President...
So... that is...

64
00:05:20,272 --> 00:05:22,831
- What are you doing, Sunbae, seriously?
- How could you do this to us?

65
00:05:22,832 --> 00:05:25,471
- I doesn't make sense. - You traitor.

66
00:05:25,472 --> 00:05:29,071
Attenzione. You all...

67
00:05:29,072 --> 00:05:31,601
You probably have lots of
things you're curious about.

68
00:05:31,602 --> 00:05:33,231
O sole mio.

69
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:34,631
Yes, Aunt.

70
00:05:34,632 --> 00:05:39,181
Officially exchange your greetings
with your team members.

71
00:05:39,182 --> 00:05:40,631
Okay.

72
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:45,151
Hello. I'm Jin Sung's new
Vice-President, Kim Poong Ho.

73
00:05:45,152 --> 00:05:48,741
Hey, Kim Poong Ho, how could
you lie to us?! How could you!

74
00:05:48,742 --> 00:05:51,171
You should have told us!

75
00:05:51,172 --> 00:05:52,531
You're too much!

76
00:05:52,532 --> 00:05:55,121
Did you ask me? You didn't ask.

77
00:05:55,122 --> 00:05:57,941
Also, how could you not know.
I give off such a noble air.

78
00:05:57,942 --> 00:05:59,821
Noble air, my butt.

79
00:05:59,822 --> 00:06:03,601
I am the Vice-President, after all, so
you should be responding properly to me.

80
00:06:03,602 --> 00:06:07,151
That's not important. Instead, can't you talk
to your father and ask him to save our team?

81
00:06:07,152 --> 00:06:10,491
That's true.

82
00:06:10,492 --> 00:06:12,481
I already asked but...

83
00:06:12,482 --> 00:06:16,101
The decision has come from headquarters,
so there's nothing we can do.

84
00:06:16,102 --> 00:06:19,111
But why did you work here as a reporter?

85
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:24,221
Well, I should check out how the company's
coming around, you know, so I can manage it.

86
00:06:24,222 --> 00:06:28,981
Seeing that, I'm a highly capable person.

87
00:06:28,982 --> 00:06:31,822
- I could kill you— - Control
yourself, control yourself, Sunbae.

88
00:06:46,922 --> 00:06:48,471
Yes, Hye Jin.

89
00:06:48,472 --> 00:06:50,162
Where are you?

90
00:06:50,832 --> 00:06:54,371
I just... had a meeting...

91
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,231
With whom?

92
00:06:56,232 --> 00:06:57,771
Just... someone.

93
00:06:57,772 --> 00:07:00,751
You don't know that there's a big
commotion in our team, do you?

94
00:07:00,752 --> 00:07:04,882
Don't be startled. The Vice-President
who got inaugurated today...

95
00:07:05,382 --> 00:07:08,101
It's Sunbae Poong Ho! He's
a son of Jin Sung group!

96
00:07:08,102 --> 00:07:12,982
How could that be? There really are lots of
surprising things in the world, aren't there?

97
00:07:14,492 --> 00:07:19,102
I know right. There are
lots of surprising things.

98
00:07:20,672 --> 00:07:22,832
Okay, let's talk later.

99
00:07:36,702 --> 00:07:38,611
<i>Hi, Jackson!</i>

100
00:07:38,612 --> 00:07:42,071
<i>From here on, I'll tell you everything
about me. Listen carefully.</i>

101
00:07:42,072 --> 00:07:45,451
<i>Korean name: Kim Shin Hyeok. Pen name: Ten.</i>

102
00:07:45,452 --> 00:07:49,042
<i>Well, up to here, you probably
already know everything.</i>

103
00:08:10,722 --> 00:08:14,712
Yes, Crew Chief. As for the article that was to
be added to the special 20th anniversary issue,

104
00:08:15,752 --> 00:08:17,251
there is none.

105
00:08:17,252 --> 00:08:20,631
Don't put the binding on hold and just
proceed with the normal schedule.

106
00:08:20,632 --> 00:08:22,062
Yes.

107
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:35,141
What, what, what is it?

108
00:08:35,142 --> 00:08:37,391
I'm going crazy.

109
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,131
Why?

110
00:08:39,132 --> 00:08:42,781
You know I took that aptitude test?
The results came out, but...

111
00:08:42,782 --> 00:08:44,592
It came out?

112
00:08:48,642 --> 00:08:50,701
I mean, I quit being a hotelier
because it was embarrassing.

113
00:08:50,702 --> 00:08:53,932
How could I be so well
suited to be a hotelier?

114
00:08:55,542 --> 00:08:57,691
It wasn't even worth quitting.

115
00:08:57,692 --> 00:09:00,272
What is that?

116
00:09:01,092 --> 00:09:03,521
But what you felt embarassed about was
that you got the job thanks to your dad.

117
00:09:03,522 --> 00:09:06,181
Not the fact that you worked in a hotel.

118
00:09:06,182 --> 00:09:09,661
I think you actually liked working there.

119
00:09:09,662 --> 00:09:14,681
Well... I didn't hate it.

120
00:09:14,682 --> 00:09:17,021
Hey, you say that everything
else seems pathetic.

121
00:09:17,022 --> 00:09:20,372
Then, doesn't that mean you
really liked that job?

122
00:09:22,142 --> 00:09:23,012
Is that so?

123
00:09:23,013 --> 00:09:24,871
- I'm sure it is. - Is it?

124
00:09:24,872 --> 00:09:26,672
It is.

125
00:09:33,162 --> 00:09:35,832
Hello.

126
00:09:44,532 --> 00:09:47,532
<i>Exclusive interview with the author Ten</i>

127
00:10:02,652 --> 00:10:05,392
This...

128
00:10:06,142 --> 00:10:09,411
Crew Chief, I told you that there
was no additional article.

129
00:10:09,412 --> 00:10:12,341
What happened?

130
00:10:12,342 --> 00:10:15,791
How much has been circulated right now?

131
00:10:15,792 --> 00:10:18,221
Wow, Ten did an interview.

132
00:10:18,222 --> 00:10:20,621
Oh? There's an interview with Ten in it.

133
00:10:20,622 --> 00:10:23,441
I guess they really did interview him.

134
00:10:23,442 --> 00:10:25,501
Oh, it's Ten!

135
00:10:25,502 --> 00:10:28,661
<i>Reporter Kim personally came and said there
was an article to be added in a rush.</i>

136
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:31,761
<i>I told him I would confirm with the Deputy Chief
Editor, but he said it was already discussed.</i>

137
00:10:31,762 --> 00:10:34,402
<i>He said he would take full responsibility.</i>

138
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:47,661
That 20th anniversary issue that made
our insides boil actually did come out.

139
00:10:47,662 --> 00:10:50,651
W-w-what is this?

140
00:10:50,652 --> 00:10:51,951
An exclusive interview with Ten?

141
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:54,602
- What?- What, Unni?

142
00:10:57,672 --> 00:10:58,991
Isn't that Sunbae Shin Hyeok?

143
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,541
W-what's up with this?

144
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:04,631
Oh my God. There's no way!

145
00:11:04,632 --> 00:11:08,311
Wait, what's going on?
Sunbae Shin Hyeok is Ten?

146
00:11:08,312 --> 00:11:10,282
What are you...

147
00:11:14,372 --> 00:11:19,211
Wait, why is Feature Director Kim...

148
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:22,161
<i>Because today is a special day.</i>

149
00:11:22,162 --> 00:11:24,582
<i>What's so special about today?</i>

150
00:11:26,612 --> 00:11:28,942
<i>You'll find out tomorrow.</i>

151
00:11:31,292 --> 00:11:32,902
No way...

152
00:11:33,632 --> 00:11:36,001
<i>Yes, this is Ara Hotel.</i>

153
00:11:36,002 --> 00:11:38,801
Yes, please connect me to room 2024.

154
00:11:38,802 --> 00:11:41,081
<i>- That room number is vacant.- What?</i>

155
00:11:41,082 --> 00:11:43,131
Isn't there someone named Kim Shin Hyeok?

156
00:11:43,132 --> 00:11:47,432
<i>He cleared his room and
checked out this morning.</i>

157
00:11:55,542 --> 00:11:58,831
<i>Are you okay? You were really
surprised, weren't you?</i>

158
00:11:58,832 --> 00:12:00,721
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

159
00:12:00,722 --> 00:12:05,681
<i>See, you should have revealed it sooner. You
made me have to do it with my own hands.</i>

160
00:12:05,682 --> 00:12:09,071
<i>Don't do something useless
like running over to my hotel.</i>

161
00:12:09,072 --> 00:12:12,341
<i>I won't be there anyway.
Alright, I'm leaving.</i>

162
00:12:12,342 --> 00:12:14,142
<i>Bye!</i>

163
00:12:16,242 --> 00:12:18,861
Oh, my my.

164
00:12:18,862 --> 00:12:22,202
The mechanical pencil was
sufficient as a gift.

165
00:12:23,782 --> 00:12:28,202
It would have been fine even if you hadn't given us
such an overwhelming gift, Feature Director Kim.

166
00:12:30,562 --> 00:12:33,742
Wow, this guy is a born idiot.

167
00:12:41,262 --> 00:12:43,622
Wow, I'm so bored.

168
00:12:45,862 --> 00:12:48,021
What is this?

169
00:12:48,022 --> 00:12:49,421
<i>[World-renowned Novelist Ten
Finally Reveals His identity]</i>

170
00:12:49,422 --> 00:12:55,282
Oh! Th-this... 2024 is...

171
00:12:56,382 --> 00:12:57,521
I'm not seeing things, right?

172
00:12:57,522 --> 00:12:58,581
It really is Feature Director Kim!

173
00:12:58,582 --> 00:13:01,441
Wow, did you really read
Sunbae Shin Hyeok's (book)?

174
00:13:01,442 --> 00:13:03,141
This is totally unexpected!

175
00:13:03,142 --> 00:13:06,941
It doesn't seem like Sunbae Shin Hyeok.

176
00:13:06,942 --> 00:13:10,762
Up to this...

177
00:13:11,732 --> 00:13:13,762
<i>Idiot Reporter</i>

178
00:13:18,722 --> 00:13:20,901
Oh, Ha Ri. I'm in the middle of something.

179
00:13:20,902 --> 00:13:24,041
Hey, what's with this idiot reporter?

180
00:13:24,042 --> 00:13:27,781
How do you know the idiot reporter?

181
00:13:27,782 --> 00:13:32,921
<i>He's the person that I was talking about.
The one who lives in a suite room.</i>

182
00:13:32,922 --> 00:13:37,921
<i>He told me he didn't want me to tell you because
he had some personal circumstances, so I didn't.</i>

183
00:13:37,922 --> 00:13:42,562
<i>He thought about you a lot.</i>

184
00:13:51,102 --> 00:13:55,141
Oh, Seong Joon! Feature Director Kim is...

185
00:13:55,142 --> 00:13:57,241
I know.

186
00:13:57,242 --> 00:14:02,821
This issue has been distributed to all the
bookstores, right? What should we do now?

187
00:14:02,822 --> 00:14:06,381
First, I think I need to meet with Reporter
Kim. He's in a suite at Ha Ri's hotel-

188
00:14:06,382 --> 00:14:10,091
He said he already left. I looked into it.

189
00:14:10,092 --> 00:14:13,662
But I want to try going at least once.
I think I need to try.

190
00:14:18,562 --> 00:14:21,501
What is this?

191
00:14:21,502 --> 00:14:25,002
I think it's the last words that Feature
Director Kim was planning on leaving to you.

192
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:47,941
<i>Hey, Jackson! I'm going to talk about
myself from now on, so listen well.</i>

193
00:14:47,942 --> 00:14:51,401
<i>My korean name is Kim Shin Hyeok.
My pen name is Ten.</i>

194
00:14:51,402 --> 00:14:54,681
<i>Well, you'll already know this by now.</i>

195
00:14:54,682 --> 00:14:58,821
<i>I have another name, David Joseph.</i>

196
00:14:58,822 --> 00:15:00,842
<i>That is my American name.</i>

197
00:15:01,522 --> 00:15:04,861
<i>I was adopted when I was twelve years old.</i>

198
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:08,621
<i>At this time, "Ah, that's how it was."</i>

199
00:15:08,622 --> 00:15:12,341
<i>That's probably the kind
of expression you have.</i>

200
00:15:12,342 --> 00:15:15,141
<i>Although you may have noticed,
I have a good personality,</i>

201
00:15:15,142 --> 00:15:19,201
<i>and I had good parents, and grew
up receiving a lot of love.</i>

202
00:15:19,202 --> 00:15:21,441
<i>So happily that I want to brag about it.</i>

203
00:15:21,442 --> 00:15:25,981
Oh my gosh! Ma, you look
even greater than before!

204
00:15:25,982 --> 00:15:29,141
Really? Well, you look so handsome!

205
00:15:29,142 --> 00:15:31,921
Yeah, I'm still sexy.

206
00:15:31,922 --> 00:15:37,101
Dad, are you okay? What's happened to you
these days? You better gain some weight.

207
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:41,321
Well David, I'll put on some
weight if you slow down

208
00:15:41,322 --> 00:15:44,361
and stop drinking so much soju.

209
00:15:44,362 --> 00:15:45,881
How have you been, Son?

210
00:15:45,882 --> 00:15:47,581
I'm good. Everything's okay here.

211
00:15:47,582 --> 00:15:48,611
<i>We love you.</i>

212
00:15:48,612 --> 00:15:50,541
<i>- We miss you.</i>- I miss you.

213
00:15:50,542 --> 00:15:52,261
<i>Dear loving parents,</i>

214
00:15:52,262 --> 00:15:55,761
<i>I really became a fiction writer
at the spur of the moment.</i>

215
00:15:55,762 --> 00:16:01,661
<i>In high school, I uploaded my writing on the web
as a hobby, and a publisher showed interest.</i>

216
00:16:01,662 --> 00:16:05,961
<i>They wanted to release it as a book,
and I thought it wasn't a bad idea.</i>

217
00:16:05,962 --> 00:16:10,501
<i>But strangely, the focus went
in an unexpected direction.</i>

218
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:15,421
<i>To them, being an adopted Asian teenager</i>

219
00:16:15,422 --> 00:16:18,101
<i>must have been a charming gimmick.</i>

220
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:21,541
<i>I just wanted to make
the things I liked fun,</i>

221
00:16:21,542 --> 00:16:26,551
<i>but the number of people who wanted to change my
writing to suit their own taste kept growing.</i>

222
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:32,471
<i>Then, at some point, it seemed like what was mine
was turning into something that was not mine.</i>

223
00:16:32,472 --> 00:16:36,441
<i>I thought that I could keep having
fun if I gave up revealing myself,</i>

224
00:16:36,442 --> 00:16:39,861
<i>so I kept my gender, age and
my birth origin a secret</i>

225
00:16:39,862 --> 00:16:43,481
<i>and created the name Ten.</i>

226
00:16:43,482 --> 00:16:48,221
<i>The only way that I could
show myself the way I am</i>

227
00:16:48,222 --> 00:16:52,701
<i>and my writing the way it was
without judgment was, ironically,</i>

228
00:16:52,702 --> 00:16:54,801
<i>by hiding myself.</i>

229
00:16:54,802 --> 00:16:57,341
<i>So I chose this lifestyle,</i>

230
00:16:57,342 --> 00:17:02,001
<i>so that I could have fun doing
the work that I enjoy 100%.</i>

231
00:17:02,002 --> 00:17:07,961
<i>Jackson, you know my life motto, right?
"Let me do what's fun for me now."</i>

232
00:17:07,962 --> 00:17:10,701
<i>I thought that making magazines
was fun for a while,</i>

233
00:17:10,702 --> 00:17:12,901
<i>so I came to Most.</i>

234
00:17:12,902 --> 00:17:16,521
<i>With this, you should be able
to write an article, right?</i>

235
00:17:16,522 --> 00:17:19,821
<i>Okay, then that's it.</i>

236
00:17:19,822 --> 00:17:23,602
<i>Please write a good article, Jackson.</i>

237
00:17:27,782 --> 00:17:30,112
<i>You thought it was over, didn't you?</i>

238
00:17:30,902 --> 00:17:34,802
<i>I thought that I should sing you a
song since I'm already recording.</i>

239
00:17:36,702 --> 00:17:38,741
<i>One, two, one, two.</i>

240
00:17:38,742 --> 00:17:44,622
<i>That was a joke. You were fooled again,
right? I know. I see everything.</i>

241
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:52,732
How could he just leave without
saying goodbye? Seriously, Sunbae.

242
00:17:53,922 --> 00:17:57,002
Hm? What is this?

243
00:17:58,492 --> 00:18:01,841
<i>Hey, I told you not to mess with my
stuff, and here you are messing with it.</i>

244
00:18:01,842 --> 00:18:06,001
<i>Who was it? I'm thinking
it was probably Joon Woo.</i>

245
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:08,941
<i>I thought that you guys would be mad at
me, if I left without saying goodbye.</i>

246
00:18:08,942 --> 00:18:13,761
<i>I want to say my farewell. You
know that I have good manners.</i>

247
00:18:13,762 --> 00:18:18,331
<i>Sunbae Cha, I really don't
need a lot of words for you.</i>

248
00:18:18,332 --> 00:18:22,601
<i>You're seriously the best. Really the best.</i>

249
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:25,601
<i>Ah Reum, I sincerely congratulate
you on your marriage.</i>

250
00:18:25,602 --> 00:18:30,762
<i>I don't know who he is, but he's
really blessed. Look under your chair.</i>

251
00:18:34,082 --> 00:18:36,241
Omo!

252
00:18:36,242 --> 00:18:38,062
Sunbae Poong Ho,

253
00:18:39,442 --> 00:18:42,641
<i>you're dirty. You stink.
Hurry up and wash yourself.</i>

254
00:18:42,642 --> 00:18:44,721
- Poong Ho is the vice-president now.<i>-
Do something with that hair too.</i>

255
00:18:44,722 --> 00:18:45,741
I'll relay it to him.

256
00:18:45,742 --> 00:18:48,241
<i>And Joon Woo and Han Seol,</i>

257
00:18:48,242 --> 00:18:51,481
<i>stop making it so obvious
that you're dating!</i>

258
00:18:51,482 --> 00:18:55,061
<i>You make it way too obvious!
It gives me goosebumps.</i>

259
00:18:55,062 --> 00:18:58,821
<i>And to our Beautiful Trio,</i>

260
00:18:58,822 --> 00:19:02,142
<i>I hope that you hang in there until
the end and become great editors.</i>

261
00:19:04,122 --> 00:19:06,631
<i>- Strength!</i>- Strength!

262
00:19:06,632 --> 00:19:10,322
<i>Our Deputy Chief Editor who loves 525,</i>

263
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:15,821
<i>you were really surprised, weren't you?
I'm sorry.</i>

264
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:18,231
<i>You regret it, don't you! If you would
have known it would turn out like this,</i>

265
00:19:18,232 --> 00:19:20,161
<i>you would have given me
several pairs of underwear!</i>

266
00:19:20,162 --> 00:19:24,862
<i>I'm even wearing them right now
because they feel so good. Underwear.</i>

267
00:19:26,602 --> 00:19:30,801
<i>Okay. Then I'll be leaving now.</i>

268
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:32,942
<i>Everyone, live well</i>

269
00:19:34,182 --> 00:19:38,162
<i>and be healthy. Fighting, Editorial Team.</i>

270
00:19:41,612 --> 00:19:44,922
He didn't say anything to Unni Hye Jin.

271
00:19:46,572 --> 00:19:50,921
<i>Aigoo, I forgot someone!</i>

272
00:19:50,922 --> 00:19:52,241
<i>Ah, how could I make this kind of mistake?</i>

273
00:19:52,242 --> 00:19:55,062
That's right, that's right.

274
00:19:57,562 --> 00:20:02,642
<i>Editor-In-Chief, how was my last present?</i>

275
00:20:03,682 --> 00:20:08,701
<i>The Most, in a really Most-like fashion,</i>

276
00:20:08,702 --> 00:20:10,321
<i>please protect it well.</i>

277
00:20:10,322 --> 00:20:12,241
Okay.

278
00:20:12,242 --> 00:20:14,842
<i>Then I'll really be leaving now.</i>

279
00:20:15,872 --> 00:20:19,781
<i>Everyone be healthy and happy, okay?</i>

280
00:20:19,782 --> 00:20:21,442
Okay!

281
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:27,011
<i>I'm leaving. God bless.</i>

282
00:20:27,012 --> 00:20:31,842
But he didn't leave a
farewell to Noona Hye Jin.

283
00:20:42,202 --> 00:20:47,122
<i>She Was Pretty</i>

284
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:53,322
<i>Congratulations to Most Korea on the
highest circulation and sales rank</i>

285
00:20:56,632 --> 00:20:59,741
Why am I not happy at all even
though we made first place?

286
00:20:59,742 --> 00:21:01,771
I know, right?

287
00:21:01,772 --> 00:21:07,241
Did Sunbae Shin Hyeok leave Korea? Even
his phone number is completely gone.

288
00:21:07,242 --> 00:21:08,871
Kim Shin Hyeok.

289
00:21:08,872 --> 00:21:10,271
Bad guy. Seriously.

290
00:21:10,272 --> 00:21:14,371
Unni Hye Jin, didn't you say that you were
going back to the management team now?

291
00:21:14,372 --> 00:21:18,391
Yes, I'm going back tomorrow.

292
00:21:18,392 --> 00:21:22,771
What's this? Why is everyone leaving
at the same time? Feels so empty.

293
00:21:22,772 --> 00:21:25,582
Ah, that's so upsetting.

294
00:21:26,282 --> 00:21:28,041
If you're feeling down, why
don't we have a farewell party?

295
00:21:28,042 --> 00:21:30,081
That's right!- Let's
have a farewell party.

296
00:21:30,082 --> 00:21:32,291
Let's have a farewell party.

297
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:34,602
Oh!

298
00:21:37,022 --> 00:21:39,121
Sunbae, when did you get here?

299
00:21:39,122 --> 00:21:42,401
I mean... Vice-President.

300
00:21:42,402 --> 00:21:46,991
Vice President's office isn't even a jail
cell but it's so suffocating, I almost died.

301
00:21:46,992 --> 00:21:49,401
So, I'm going to work back
here again starting today.

302
00:21:49,402 --> 00:21:52,671
What kind of Vice-President does that? Would
our company work well if you did that?

303
00:21:52,672 --> 00:21:54,791
Geesh! I'm just going to peel all
the keratin off of your head!

304
00:21:54,792 --> 00:21:57,881
- Leave, hurry up and leave.-
Get out of here. Go!

305
00:21:57,882 --> 00:22:01,311
I'll throw a farewell
party for Hye Jin today

306
00:22:01,312 --> 00:22:03,481
with this gold card...

307
00:22:03,482 --> 00:22:06,301
- Unni!- Woah!

308
00:22:06,302 --> 00:22:08,311
What about a buffet?

309
00:22:08,312 --> 00:22:11,021
- Lobster! It has to be lobster!- No,
let's get the full course set menu.

310
00:22:11,022 --> 00:22:12,871
Full course menu!

311
00:22:12,872 --> 00:22:14,222
Lobster. King crab.

312
00:22:16,282 --> 00:22:17,381
What's with that hair?

313
00:22:17,382 --> 00:22:22,501
<i>Back to number one. Really good work.
You can expect a reward.</i>

314
00:22:22,502 --> 00:22:24,401
<i>Now, get ready to return.</i>

315
00:22:24,402 --> 00:22:27,152
Okay, I got it.

316
00:22:32,812 --> 00:22:35,372
<i>December Issue Fashion Magazine
Score GraphFirst place: The Most</i>

317
00:22:41,882 --> 00:22:45,471
Are you okay? You drank
everything that was offered.

318
00:22:45,472 --> 00:22:49,121
They were throwing a farewell party for
me, so I should at least drink that much.

319
00:22:49,122 --> 00:22:53,691
And I'm pretty good with alcohol.

320
00:22:53,692 --> 00:22:55,892
Like that's something to brag about!

321
00:22:57,742 --> 00:23:02,382
Let's talk for a while before we go. I'll
go buy something warm, so you go ahead.

322
00:23:06,982 --> 00:23:08,922
Where did she go?

323
00:23:12,192 --> 00:23:15,091
Oh, you startled me!

324
00:23:15,092 --> 00:23:17,782
The moon is really bright.

325
00:23:21,182 --> 00:23:23,892
<i>Deputy Chief Editor?</i>

326
00:23:25,742 --> 00:23:28,162
<i>The moon is pretty bright.</i>

327
00:23:30,932 --> 00:23:34,771
This seems really familiar, doesn't it?

328
00:23:34,772 --> 00:23:37,952
Let's go, slide-mania!

329
00:23:48,102 --> 00:23:50,272
Ah, it's cold.

330
00:24:01,882 --> 00:24:06,761
They called me to return to headquarters.

331
00:24:06,762 --> 00:24:11,951
They even offered me a
much higher position.

332
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:16,291
Really? Oh, my boyfriend is so cool!

333
00:24:16,292 --> 00:24:19,092
Is this a high-speed promotion?

334
00:24:21,162 --> 00:24:24,251
It's probably a reward for
getting <i>Most</i> to first place.

335
00:24:24,252 --> 00:24:28,911
But... I didn't do that
through my own power.

336
00:24:28,912 --> 00:24:32,521
I wouldn't have been able to do
it without Feature Editor Kim.

337
00:24:32,522 --> 00:24:34,582
That's why I

338
00:24:36,082 --> 00:24:38,441
am going to refuse that position.

339
00:24:38,442 --> 00:24:39,531
What?

340
00:24:39,532 --> 00:24:44,561
I told you that I would propose to
you if we made it to first place

341
00:24:44,562 --> 00:24:48,811
and that I wanted to be
with you at my best moment,

342
00:24:48,812 --> 00:24:54,951
but this isn't the moment that I imagined.

343
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:59,801
I have to go back for now.

344
00:24:59,802 --> 00:25:03,481
I may have to go back and
take care of everything,

345
00:25:03,482 --> 00:25:07,881
then start again from the very beginning.

346
00:25:07,882 --> 00:25:15,241
I may not be able to show you the best
moment that I was thinking of right away.

347
00:25:15,242 --> 00:25:22,871
But Hye Jin... Will you still ♪
<i>You were the one at my side.</i> ♪

356
00:26:07,962 --> 00:26:08,802
What?

360

361
00:26:26,712 --> 00:26:28,821
I told you not to joke around.

362
00:26:28,822 --> 00:26:31,672
I'm going to go down the slide!

363
00:26:35,872 --> 00:26:37,221
That one's mine!

364
00:26:37,222 --> 00:26:40,802
It's mine! It's mine!

365
00:26:47,582 --> 00:26:51,431
I'm really thankful to
you for all this time.

366
00:26:51,432 --> 00:26:53,481
Unni, do you really have to leave?

367
00:26:53,482 --> 00:26:55,061
It's so sad, Unni.

368
00:26:55,062 --> 00:26:56,811
Unni, don't go.

369
00:26:56,812 --> 00:26:58,551
Do you really have to leave?

370
00:26:58,552 --> 00:27:01,702
- Do you really have to?- Noona.

371
00:27:03,842 --> 00:27:07,581
- Goodbye.- Bye.

372
00:27:07,582 --> 00:27:11,971
I think it would be best if
you left now, Kim Hye Jin.

373
00:27:11,972 --> 00:27:13,891
- You worked hard.- Yes, sir.

374
00:27:13,892 --> 00:27:16,492
I'll come hang out with you guys often!

375
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:33,201
You went through a lot, Hye Jin.

376
00:27:33,202 --> 00:27:35,531
Sunbae Cha.

377
00:27:35,532 --> 00:27:38,051
When I think of how you were
when you first came here,

378
00:27:38,052 --> 00:27:41,371
I think you've become a totally
different person. It's nice to see.

379
00:27:41,372 --> 00:27:44,661
Thank you so much, Sunbaenim.

380
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:49,271
I really, really learned a lot.

381
00:27:49,272 --> 00:27:51,821
Ah, why do I feel like this?

382
00:27:51,822 --> 00:27:54,681
It feels like I'm sending
my kid off somewhere.

383
00:27:54,682 --> 00:27:56,141
Sunbaenim!

384
00:27:56,142 --> 00:28:01,862
Omo, I was so mushy just now.
I take that back. Bye.

385
00:28:03,552 --> 00:28:05,352
Ah, yes!

386
00:28:12,272 --> 00:28:14,051
I'm here.

387
00:28:14,052 --> 00:28:17,361
- Hye Jin!- It's Hye Jin!

388
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:20,781
Wow, do you know how much I
was looking forward to today?

389
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:25,182
I'm glad that you came. Let's
give a round of applause.

390
00:28:25,252 --> 00:28:27,082
Welcome!

391
00:28:45,492 --> 00:28:49,412
So I'm back.

392
00:28:55,592 --> 00:28:57,971
Team Manager, should I do anything?

393
00:28:57,972 --> 00:29:01,612
What do you mean, what should you do?
It's 6 o'clock. You should go home.

394
00:29:08,352 --> 00:29:12,572
Wow, I feel flustered from
ending work so early.

395
00:29:17,012 --> 00:29:18,942
Feature Director Kim?

396
00:29:19,692 --> 00:29:24,332
Feature Director! Feature Director Kim!

397
00:29:26,672 --> 00:29:28,862
Sorry.

398
00:29:33,332 --> 00:29:36,981
He definitely looked like
Feature Director Kim.

399
00:29:36,982 --> 00:29:39,962
I think it is him.

400
00:29:46,572 --> 00:29:48,602
Was it not him?

401
00:30:03,402 --> 00:30:06,461
Hey, Jackson. Have you been well?

402
00:30:06,462 --> 00:30:08,662
Feature Director!

403
00:30:10,822 --> 00:30:12,561
What happened to you?

404
00:30:12,562 --> 00:30:15,521
How could you just suddenly
disappear without a word?

405
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:18,521
How could you, seriously?

406
00:30:18,522 --> 00:30:21,161
Why am I the only one...

407
00:30:21,162 --> 00:30:23,541
Why am I the only one
you didn't say bye to?

408
00:30:23,542 --> 00:30:26,661
That's why I came to say goodbye like this.

409
00:30:26,662 --> 00:30:30,381
Do you know how worried everyone was?
Where are you staying?

410
00:30:30,382 --> 00:30:33,701
Are you eating? Are you really alright?

411
00:30:33,702 --> 00:30:38,411

What have you been typing so much?

433
00:33:07,002 --> 00:33:13,101
The thing is, there are so many things to
spend money on, and it's obvious what I have.

434
00:33:13,102 --> 00:33:16,022
I don't have anything else to sell!

435
00:33:17,022 --> 00:33:21,282
You can sell that.

436
00:33:23,122 --> 00:33:27,301
No, I can't. I bought this fair
and square with my own money.

437
00:33:27,302 --> 00:33:30,182
Oh, is that so?

438
00:33:32,642 --> 00:33:37,921
But, I'm really happy that we spend
time together on the weekends.

439
00:33:37,922 --> 00:33:41,441
If you were still on the editing team, you
would have had to work even on the weekends.

440
00:33:41,442 --> 00:33:46,001
You don't have any overtime or night
shifts. You're happy about it too, right?

441
00:33:46,002 --> 00:33:49,062
Of course! I'm totally happy!

442
00:33:51,302 --> 00:33:56,441
But how do I get an educational loan?

443
00:33:56,442 --> 00:33:58,042
Why?

444
00:33:59,422 --> 00:34:02,921
I want to go to graduate
school for hotel management.

445
00:34:02,922 --> 00:34:04,041
Really?

446
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,981
Yeah.

447
00:34:05,982 --> 00:34:11,521
Now that I thought about what you said,
it seems I really liked that work.

448
00:34:11,522 --> 00:34:15,432
That's why I'm going to
study properly this time.

449
00:34:16,182 --> 00:34:20,841
There, there. Such a good girl.
You thought well.

450
00:34:20,842 --> 00:34:25,042
I'm an expert in tuitions
and loans, so don't worry.

451
00:34:29,362 --> 00:34:32,241
Hello, Writer.

452
00:34:32,242 --> 00:34:33,721
Have you been doing well?

453
00:34:33,722 --> 00:34:37,141
Yes. You've been well too, right?

454
00:34:37,142 --> 00:34:41,961
I called the journalist who wrote the
article to thank for writing it so well.

455
00:34:41,962 --> 00:34:44,581
Ah, I'm not a journalist.

456
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:49,161
I was just moved to the editing team for a little while
and I've returned back to the management team now.

457
00:34:49,162 --> 00:34:51,421
Oh, really?

458
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:55,341
If you have some time, come over here
to take a break and get some air.

459
00:34:55,342 --> 00:34:59,501
Yes, ma'am. I will. Yes, goodbye.

460
00:34:59,502 --> 00:35:00,801
Wait, Hye Jin!

461
00:35:00,802 --> 00:35:02,841
Yes?

462
00:35:02,842 --> 00:35:04,561
Where are you? At home?

463
00:35:04,562 --> 00:35:08,821
I'm in Ha-il right now to see the
children's book writer I met last time.

464
00:35:08,822 --> 00:35:12,341
Really? If I would have known you were going
there, I would have taken you in my car.

465
00:35:12,342 --> 00:35:13,941
No, what do you mean?

466
00:35:13,942 --> 00:35:14,922
Later,

467
00:35:14,923 --> 00:35:16,981
you can eat dinner with me, right?

468
00:35:16,982 --> 00:35:21,422
Yeah. Okay, see you later.

469
00:35:24,102 --> 00:35:26,642
Huh? Is this it?

470
00:35:28,262 --> 00:35:33,662
But at this point, shouldn't
a tiger come out roaring?

471
00:35:35,802 --> 00:35:38,102
- That would be really good!- I don't know.

472
00:35:42,102 --> 00:35:43,621
You're here, Hye Jin?

473
00:35:43,622 --> 00:35:45,571
Hello!

474
00:35:45,572 --> 00:35:48,721
I was just watching because I was
worried I might be interrupting them.

475
00:35:48,722 --> 00:35:50,761
No, let's go in.

476
00:35:50,762 --> 00:35:52,822
- No.- Let's go in.

477
00:35:52,882 --> 00:35:57,282
That's right.- No. That cute bear...
What's cute about a bear?

478
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:59,541
Attention, everyone.

479
00:35:59,542 --> 00:36:04,661
Say hello. These are my colleagues
who work together with me here.

480
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:07,401
- Hello.- Hello!

481
00:36:07,402 --> 00:36:08,921
Nice to meet you!

482
00:36:08,922 --> 00:36:14,581
Ah, this is that journalist who wrote
that interview article before?

483
00:36:14,582 --> 00:36:17,722
No, I'm not a journalist.

484
00:36:20,602 --> 00:36:22,961
Your workplace is so pretty.

485
00:36:22,962 --> 00:36:25,161
But were there originally
this many authors?

486
00:36:25,162 --> 00:36:27,321
No, we got together not too long ago.

487
00:36:27,322 --> 00:36:31,981
We're going to be working on a
collaborative creative project together.

488
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:35,341
For about a year, they're all
trapped here, unable to move.

489
00:36:35,342 --> 00:36:40,881
Wow, that sounds so fun! I'm so jealous!
That's so cool.

490
00:36:40,882 --> 00:36:45,282
Why don't you try it instead of
just being envious? - Pardon?

491
00:36:45,382 --> 00:36:48,801
Maybe it's because I heard that it was your
childhood dream to become a children's book writer,

492
00:36:48,802 --> 00:36:54,181
I'm really sad to hear that
you don't write anymore.

493
00:36:54,182 --> 00:36:56,561
I just went back to where I originally was.

494
00:36:56,562 --> 00:37:01,781
The place you originally were could be
like a mold that you create for yourself.

495
00:37:01,782 --> 00:37:07,981
I am thinking where you want to
be is the right place to be.

496
00:37:07,982 --> 00:37:13,241
That's why I'm saying this. We're looking for a person who could be the
youngest <i>(junior in experience, not in age)</i> story writer in our team.

497
00:37:13,242 --> 00:37:16,201
Hye Jin, would you consider it?

498
00:37:16,202 --> 00:37:18,261
Me?

499
00:37:18,262 --> 00:37:24,201
I know it was the writing of a reporter, but
I really liked your writing and feeling.

500
00:37:24,202 --> 00:37:26,182
Oh, you're too kind.

501
00:37:27,322 --> 00:37:31,162
And, I'm going to America soon.

502
00:37:32,962 --> 00:37:35,821
I think that I'm going to get married.

503
00:37:35,822 --> 00:37:38,301
Really? Congratulations!

504
00:37:38,302 --> 00:37:40,421
Thank you.

505
00:37:40,422 --> 00:37:44,561
The workplace there is so pretty.
It's so cute and

506
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:48,381
it feels like your heart warms
up just by being in there.

507
00:37:48,382 --> 00:37:51,441
- You know what that
feeling is, right?- Yeah.

508
00:37:51,442 --> 00:37:53,381
I don't know if it's because
they write children's stories,

509
00:37:53,382 --> 00:37:55,981
but the writers' impressions were
really nice and lovely. And...

510
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:58,571
Wait a second, wait a second.
Drink some water.

511
00:37:58,572 --> 00:38:01,941
You're going to run out of breath.

512
00:38:01,942 --> 00:38:07,282
And they were sitting around a table
about this big having a story meeting.

513
00:38:10,262 --> 00:38:13,082
Thank you.

514
00:38:19,262 --> 00:38:21,162
It's delicious.

515
00:38:23,142 --> 00:38:28,811
That writer's dream was for people who are
like-minded to gather and write collaboratively.

516
00:38:28,812 --> 00:38:34,322
So this time she really made a creative
fairy tale village. Isn't that so cool?

517
00:38:36,162 --> 00:38:39,241
Don't you want to do that too?

518
00:38:39,242 --> 00:38:42,701
You look extremely fired
up and excited right now.

519
00:38:42,702 --> 00:38:46,371
Your dream was to be a writer of
children's books when you were younger.

520
00:38:46,372 --> 00:38:49,001
But I'm going to be
leaving with you anyway.

521
00:38:49,002 --> 00:38:54,502
That's right, we were going to talk about
language schools today. What do I need to do?

522
00:39:01,262 --> 00:39:06,441
First, you need to look
at these and choose.

523
00:39:06,442 --> 00:39:10,021
In about a year, will I be
able to speak English too?

524
00:39:10,022 --> 00:39:12,962
This is so cool!

525
00:39:16,342 --> 00:39:19,722
Where should I go?

526
00:39:25,182 --> 00:39:28,102
It's so hard to choose.

527
00:39:36,522 --> 00:39:39,061
Why are you already up on a Sunday?

528
00:39:39,062 --> 00:39:44,321
Well, for me, everyday is like Sunday.

529
00:39:44,322 --> 00:39:48,941
These are potential questions for my graduate
school interview. Ask me some questions.

530
00:39:48,942 --> 00:39:51,241
Interview questions?

531
00:39:51,242 --> 00:39:53,841
Let's see... Four P's are?

532
00:39:53,842 --> 00:39:56,841
The four key elements required
for effective marketing.

533
00:39:56,842 --> 00:39:59,521
Product, price, place, promotion!

534
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:02,861
Woah! Then, what is promotion?

535
00:40:02,862 --> 00:40:08,401
Advertising, PR, direct marketing, sales marketing,
and so forth. Meaning, communication with customers.

536
00:40:08,402 --> 00:40:11,022
Woah, Min Ha Ri! You studied hard!

537
00:40:13,552 --> 00:40:15,731
I'm pretty awesome, aren't I?

538
00:40:15,732 --> 00:40:19,342
I mean, was studying always this fun?

539
00:40:22,792 --> 00:40:28,011
Product, service, design, quality...

540
00:40:28,012 --> 00:40:31,961
Ha Ri, you look really pretty right now.

541
00:40:31,962 --> 00:40:35,362
So out of the blue...

542
00:40:36,542 --> 00:40:37,841
Just today?

543
00:40:37,842 --> 00:40:41,361
Not your face, but your expression.

544
00:40:41,362 --> 00:40:43,701
You look really excited.

545
00:40:43,702 --> 00:40:44,931
Really?

546
00:40:44,932 --> 00:40:49,792
In any case, I am really
excited these days.

547
00:40:50,902 --> 00:40:56,252
Are we going to differentiate the products?

548
00:41:15,142 --> 00:41:17,862
You don't look pretty.

549
00:41:19,132 --> 00:41:22,591
You don't look excited at all.

550
00:41:22,592 --> 00:41:28,102
<i>So this time she really made a creative
fairy tale village. Isn't that so cool?</i>

551
00:41:30,042 --> 00:41:33,041
<i>Don't you want to do that, too?</i>

552
00:41:33,042 --> 00:41:36,942
<i>You look really fired up
and excited right now.</i>

553
00:41:59,062 --> 00:42:01,782
<i>I hope that you will always keep
on dreaming, Hye Jin.. -Lee Yi Eun</i>

554
00:42:02,362 --> 00:42:08,102
<i>I am thinking where you want to
be is the right place to be.</i>

555
00:42:14,382 --> 00:42:17,962
<i>Do you want to eat dinner
together at home later?</i>

556
00:42:27,282 --> 00:42:29,502
<i>Golden Dew</i>

557
00:42:44,742 --> 00:42:48,181
You're here, come in.

558
00:42:48,182 --> 00:42:51,481
- Let's get married,
Seong Joon.- Huh? What?!

559
00:42:51,482 --> 00:42:55,721
So, what' I'm saying is...
We're getting married,

560
00:42:55,722 --> 00:42:58,911
but I'm going to marry you no
matter what happens anyway.

561
00:42:58,912 --> 00:43:01,241
So, of course I should do it with you.

562
00:43:01,242 --> 00:43:04,752
I'm going to, but... Oh.

563
00:43:05,732 --> 00:43:12,051
I got rings ready too. This one is
mine, and... Give me your hand.

564
00:43:12,052 --> 00:43:14,591
This one is yours.

565
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:18,121
I'm proposing to you right now, you know.

566
00:43:18,122 --> 00:43:22,081
But I'm not saying we
should do it right away.

567
00:43:22,082 --> 00:43:25,291
You're asking me to give
you about a year, right?

568
00:43:25,292 --> 00:43:27,881
How did you know?

569
00:43:27,882 --> 00:43:31,431
So, the thing is, if you want
to know why I need time...

570
00:43:31,432 --> 00:43:36,361
It's because you want to try doing the childrens'
stories job that was proposed to you, right?

571
00:43:36,362 --> 00:43:39,701
How did you know that?

572
00:43:39,702 --> 00:43:43,052
Thank you for being honest with me.

573
00:43:43,822 --> 00:43:47,491
I saw that you want to do that.

574
00:43:47,492 --> 00:43:52,781
I was a little worried that you were
giving it up because of me, too.

575
00:43:52,782 --> 00:43:56,011
So you knew.

576
00:43:56,012 --> 00:43:59,431
If you would have stayed silent about it and just gone to
America with me, you definitely would have had some regrets.

577
00:43:59,432 --> 00:44:01,491
You definitely would have had some regrets.

578
00:44:01,492 --> 00:44:04,111
You would have stewed over it by yourself

579
00:44:04,112 --> 00:44:06,441
and I wouldn't have known it

580
00:44:06,442 --> 00:44:11,241
and would have felt sorry and upset
when I found out about it later.

581
00:44:11,242 --> 00:44:15,492
You told me because you trust me, right?

582
00:44:18,132 --> 00:44:22,722
I wanted to look beautiful to myself.

583
00:44:26,532 --> 00:44:29,861
When someone is doing something
that they really want to do,

584
00:44:29,862 --> 00:44:33,821
they look the most beautiful.

585
00:44:33,822 --> 00:44:38,001
I also wanted to look truly beautiful

586
00:44:38,002 --> 00:44:40,681
as I do the work that I really want to do.

587
00:44:40,682 --> 00:44:43,842
Not to someone else,

588
00:44:45,102 --> 00:44:47,502
but to myself.

589
00:44:50,222 --> 00:44:53,962
That's right. You thought well.

590
00:44:54,562 --> 00:44:58,462
Thank you, and sorry.

591
00:44:59,492 --> 00:45:04,381
But I feel kind of wronged! I was planning
on going all out for my proposal.

592
00:45:04,382 --> 00:45:06,571
Really?

593
00:45:06,572 --> 00:45:09,111
How were you planning on doing it?

594
00:45:09,112 --> 00:45:12,861
It's too late now. It's
fine if you don't know.

595
00:45:12,862 --> 00:45:16,682
Let's do a puzzle together for
the first time in a long time.

596
00:45:17,332 --> 00:45:22,052
- Why? How were planning on doing it?
What is it?- Shh!

597
00:45:32,822 --> 00:45:34,781
But seriously, how were you going to do it?

598
00:45:34,782 --> 00:45:37,921
Just tell me a little bit
of how you were going to.

599
00:45:37,922 --> 00:45:42,201
Why are you asking me now?
I told you it's fine.

600
00:45:42,202 --> 00:45:46,632
Bring the peeking sister puzzle
next time so we can fit that piece.

601
00:45:47,442 --> 00:45:49,001
But where did that one piece go?

602
00:45:49,002 --> 00:45:52,441
Ah, you really can't tell me? I'm curious!

603
00:45:52,442 --> 00:45:55,582
How were you going to propose?!

604
00:45:57,722 --> 00:46:01,222
It's over there. Go get it.

605
00:46:19,922 --> 00:46:24,032
I was planning on proposing like this.

606
00:46:28,652 --> 00:46:30,562
And

607
00:46:31,432 --> 00:46:35,932
I was planning on saying this too.

608
00:46:42,442 --> 00:46:46,351
Before I met you, I didn't know

609
00:46:46,352 --> 00:46:50,791
that it was possible to live
so happily in this world.

610
00:46:50,792 --> 00:46:54,851
I want to make you feel the
happiness that you made me feel

611
00:46:54,852 --> 00:46:59,422
for the rest of our lives.

612
00:47:00,332 --> 00:47:02,831
Hye Jin,

613
00:47:02,832 --> 00:47:05,351

00:48:02,712 --> 00:48:05,892
Do you really have to go?

626
00:48:08,742 --> 00:48:12,381
Well, I mean... It's late,

627
00:48:12,382 --> 00:48:16,441
I didn't put my laundry away... and...

628
00:48:16,442 --> 00:48:20,311
I need to separate my trash.

629
00:48:20,312 --> 00:48:24,402
Alright, let's go. I'll take you home.

630
00:48:36,172 --> 00:48:40,471
Ah, my car key! I must have left it.
Stay here, I'll go get it real quick.

631
00:48:40,472 --> 00:48:44,331
- Hey, I can just ride this taxi.-
Just stay here. I'll take you.

632
00:48:44,332 --> 00:48:49,962
It only takes 10 minutes to get there anyway.
I'm going! I'll call you when I get there. Bye!

633
00:49:15,242 --> 00:49:17,472
Who is it?

634
00:49:20,702 --> 00:49:22,842
Hye Jin.

635
00:49:24,112 --> 00:49:30,481
Well, now that I think about it, I don't
really have to fold my laundry today,

636
00:49:30,482 --> 00:49:34,632
I was thinking that I don't have
to separate my trash today either.

637
00:50:06,062 --> 00:50:11,441
Do you have to live and eat there? Can't
you go back and forth from this house?

638
00:50:11,442 --> 00:50:13,371
It's a collaborative work.

639
00:50:13,372 --> 00:50:17,181
Until the final product comes
out, all the writers stay there,

640
00:50:17,182 --> 00:50:19,581
I have to stay there as well.

641
00:50:19,582 --> 00:50:23,111
Even yesterday, it didn't feel real
that you are leaving this house.

642
00:50:23,112 --> 00:50:27,821
Now that you're packing, I'm
getting the real sense of it.

643
00:50:27,822 --> 00:50:30,421
You're right.

644
00:50:30,422 --> 00:50:34,541
Except when my family was
in Japan, for you and me,

645
00:50:34,542 --> 00:50:38,202
this is our first time
separating like this, right?

646
00:50:57,222 --> 00:50:59,212
Are you crying?

647
00:51:00,312 --> 00:51:03,011
Crying? Why would I cry?

648
00:51:03,012 --> 00:51:05,091
Why would you cry?

649
00:51:05,092 --> 00:51:09,561
Because you're about to
cry, so it's making me cry!

650
00:51:09,562 --> 00:51:13,621
I almost went to America but I'm going to Haeil,
which is way closer, so why are you crying?

651
00:51:13,622 --> 00:51:15,921
It'll only take 2 hours to get
there if you're determined.

652
00:51:15,922 --> 00:51:20,371
Even when I wasn't determined, we saw each
other everyday for the last ten years...

653
00:51:20,372 --> 00:51:23,622
But now we can only see each
other when we're determined.

654
00:51:25,352 --> 00:51:29,582
Why are you saying stuff
like that and making me cry?

655
00:51:40,372 --> 00:51:46,241
If you're not here, who'll cry
and blow their nose with me?

656
00:51:46,242 --> 00:51:50,811
If you cry, I'll run over
to blow my nose with you.

657
00:51:50,812 --> 00:51:54,401
Will you really come and
blow your nose with me?

658
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:56,592
Of course!

659
00:51:58,732 --> 00:52:01,902
- Hye Jin. - Ha Ri.

660
00:52:12,132 --> 00:52:13,821
For Kim Hye Jin's new beginning, and...

661
00:52:13,822 --> 00:52:19,241
To Min Ha Ri's graduate school acceptance!
Cheers! Love shot!

Do you remember when we
first moved into here?

666
00:52:41,702 --> 00:52:45,032
The boiler broke and everything.

667
00:52:45,882 --> 00:52:49,231
You mean the day when our lips
almost got twisted when we got up?

668
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:51,471
Do you remember that?

669
00:52:51,472 --> 00:52:55,221
While you were in the middle of taking a shower,
suddenly, there was a shortage of water.

670
00:52:55,222 --> 00:53:00,952
- So while washing your hair... Yes, of course, I remember.
I was shampooing and the water stopped so suddenly!

671
00:53:01,862 --> 00:53:06,631
Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!

672
00:53:06,632 --> 00:53:09,961
- Don't go, Hye Jin. - No.

673
00:53:09,962 --> 00:53:11,951
- I will go. - No, don't.

674
00:53:11,952 --> 00:53:15,691
- You don't even do cleaning.
- No, don't go. - No.

675
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:21,202
Hey, Min Ha Ri, you want to die?!

676
00:53:23,582 --> 00:53:26,281
That's the office over there.

677
00:53:26,282 --> 00:53:29,391
Oh, that looks great.

678
00:53:29,392 --> 00:53:33,422
I might just live here
and not go to New York.

679
00:53:34,592 --> 00:53:38,472
When do I go to the airport tomorrow?
When's your flight?

680
00:53:40,582 --> 00:53:42,122
Hye Jin.

681
00:53:42,182 --> 00:53:48,782
Should we not do something like
crying and separate at the airport?

682
00:53:48,862 --> 00:53:52,361
Why? I still need to go
there and see you off.

683
00:53:52,362 --> 00:53:56,341
I might not see you for a whole year.

684
00:53:56,342 --> 00:53:59,261
I'm worried that it wouldn't
work out well because of me.

685
00:53:59,262 --> 00:54:03,591
I was pretending to be cool when I said okay
to your choice, but if I see you there,

686
00:54:03,592 --> 00:54:10,051
I'm worried that I might beg you to
come with me and cry and whatnot.

687
00:54:10,052 --> 00:54:12,832
Then you're saying we should separate here?

688
00:54:14,142 --> 00:54:19,512
Keep your guard up. You never know
when I'll suddenly show up here.

689
00:54:27,642 --> 00:54:33,612
I will call you ten times a day,
and send you emails every day.

690
00:54:34,472 --> 00:54:39,412
Like in the past, let's write
letters to each other often.

691
00:54:42,222 --> 00:54:44,232
Let's do that.

692
00:54:57,132 --> 00:54:58,231
Go in.

693
00:54:58,232 --> 00:55:01,822
You go first, I'll go
in after I see you off.

694
00:55:04,462 --> 00:55:05,902
Okay.

695
00:55:07,212 --> 00:55:10,422
I'm going.
