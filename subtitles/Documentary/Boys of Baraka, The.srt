1
00:00:57,665 --> 00:00:59,895
What's this "having a picnic"
in my car?

2
00:01:00,665 --> 00:01:04,180
I'm not getting sex at home.
Don't deny me this.

3
00:01:04,425 --> 00:01:06,495
You sleep with
a beautiful woman nightly.

4
00:01:06,825 --> 00:01:11,182
"Married" means you sleep together,
but you can't get none.

5
00:01:15,385 --> 00:01:17,774
Watch it with all that shit,
all right?

6
00:01:20,025 --> 00:01:21,174
Where are your cup holders?

7
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:22,495
I don't have one.

8
00:01:22,825 --> 00:01:26,738
$80,000 for this car
and there's no cup holder?

9
00:01:27,065 --> 00:01:31,058
It's $105,000, and it's one of
the fastest cars on earth.

10
00:01:31,305 --> 00:01:32,784
0 to 60 in 4 seconds.

11
00:01:33,025 --> 00:01:35,778
-It's a limited edition.
-You damn right!

12
00:01:36,025 --> 00:01:37,743
No cup holder, no back seat.

13
00:01:38,225 --> 00:01:40,181
It's a shiny dick
with 2 chairs in it.

14
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:43,185
I guess we the balls,
just dragging along.

15
00:01:44,465 --> 00:01:45,341
Damn!

16
00:01:46,665 --> 00:01:47,541
Sorry.

17
00:01:52,985 --> 00:01:53,781
Get it.

18
00:01:54,345 --> 00:01:56,905
I can't get down there.
You got an engineering flaw.

19
00:01:57,185 --> 00:01:58,743
My shit ain't going down
up in there.

20
00:01:59,665 --> 00:02:01,860
Go!
Titty-titty, strutty-strutty.

21
00:02:02,105 --> 00:02:03,982
Make them want it.

22
00:02:04,225 --> 00:02:05,977
I ain't cleaning up after you.

23
00:02:06,225 --> 00:02:09,979
My hand can't get down there.
When it does, it gets stuck.

24
00:02:10,265 --> 00:02:12,381
Then you got this shit.

25
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:13,694
Get that fry.

26
00:02:13,945 --> 00:02:15,663
This ain't Denny's!

27
00:02:16,465 --> 00:02:20,094
I wouldn't buy from Denny's.
I don't like how we been treated.

28
00:02:20,305 --> 00:02:22,455
They bit.
Let's gank these fools!

29
00:02:23,425 --> 00:02:26,417
You ain't interested in the fry.
You all up in that.

30
00:02:26,745 --> 00:02:27,541
Get out.

31
00:02:27,745 --> 00:02:28,621
Shit!

32
00:02:28,825 --> 00:02:31,339
-What the fuck?!
-We've had a big week.

33
00:02:31,665 --> 00:02:33,303
So get out of the car.

34
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:35,581
Damn!
What you weigh, 350?

35
00:02:37,025 --> 00:02:38,936
You're a chicken-eating fucker, right?

36
00:02:40,105 --> 00:02:42,460
Why I always get
the big motherfuckers?

37
00:02:42,785 --> 00:02:43,854
Get out!

38
00:02:44,145 --> 00:02:45,419
All right! All right!

39
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,223
Hold on!

40
00:02:47,465 --> 00:02:50,343
Funny! Let me tell you
how bad a day you're having.

41
00:02:50,585 --> 00:02:52,098
We're cops.

42
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,336
And I'm a standup comedian...

43
00:02:54,665 --> 00:02:57,054
...and I suck!
So I need your car.

44
00:02:57,305 --> 00:02:58,374
I ain't Wesley Snipes.

45
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:01,935
I just hang out with stupid friends
who drive cars...

46
00:03:02,465 --> 00:03:04,183
...that attract fucking attention!

47
00:03:04,465 --> 00:03:08,378
I need to jump over this car
and smack you in the head.

48
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:11,423
-You're arguing over a fry!
-It's not about that.

49
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,820
It's your disrespect
for my property!

50
00:03:14,025 --> 00:03:15,663
-Hey, hey!
-Shut up!

51
00:03:15,905 --> 00:03:18,863
This is stupid!
Hold the fuck on!

52
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:21,181
If you want some bad enough,
come get some!

53
00:03:24,665 --> 00:03:25,780
You like that shit?

54
00:03:26,025 --> 00:03:28,414
Wesley Snipes, Passenger 57.

55
00:03:28,665 --> 00:03:30,496
Now get me a fucking Handi Wipe.

56
00:03:31,425 --> 00:03:33,222
Let's hear a joke, bitch!

57
00:05:04,665 --> 00:05:06,895
What do you think?
Looks like the real thing.

58
00:05:07,465 --> 00:05:08,580
Remember your assignment?

59
00:05:09,065 --> 00:05:10,418
I'm a decoy.

60
00:05:11,305 --> 00:05:12,101
You are.

61
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:20,579
What are you doing?!

62
00:05:22,545 --> 00:05:23,341
Police?

63
00:05:23,585 --> 00:05:25,815
I just saw a policeman shot...

64
00:05:26,065 --> 00:05:29,102
...at South Miami and 1st Street.
Help, please!

65
00:05:29,425 --> 00:05:31,575
All units. Officer down.

66
00:05:31,825 --> 00:05:33,144
A squad code 3.

67
00:05:37,865 --> 00:05:40,015
All units respond and identify.

68
00:06:00,025 --> 00:06:03,142
Officer down.
We need additional ground units.

69
00:06:08,385 --> 00:06:11,263
Air 3, Roger.
Suspect or suspects unknown.

70
00:06:15,905 --> 00:06:17,736
Gentlemen, it's clear.

71
00:06:49,985 --> 00:06:50,974
We're inside.

72
00:06:56,745 --> 00:06:57,541
We're in.

73
00:06:58,185 --> 00:06:59,379
You got 20 minutes.

74
00:07:09,665 --> 00:07:11,860
Goddamn tacos will kill me.

75
00:07:25,385 --> 00:07:27,853
We got 1 2 minutes.
Let's go.

76
00:07:44,585 --> 00:07:46,257
Clear. We're in.

77
00:08:11,945 --> 00:08:13,981
Move your ass.
We got 6 minutes.

78
00:08:15,265 --> 00:08:16,095
Ready.

79
00:08:21,705 --> 00:08:23,855
Ready to fire.
Go!

80
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:35,819
Fire!

81
00:08:39,425 --> 00:08:40,414
Go!

82
00:08:54,945 --> 00:08:55,855
Move!

83
00:09:21,705 --> 00:09:22,933
Damn!

84
00:09:24,025 --> 00:09:25,344
Did you have sweet dreams?

85
00:09:27,425 --> 00:09:29,336
You're so nasty.

86
00:09:30,305 --> 00:09:32,660
You always saying
you want quality time.

87
00:09:33,225 --> 00:09:37,013
I got the time and you
damn sure got the quality.

88
00:09:38,225 --> 00:09:39,260
Come on now.

89
00:09:40,545 --> 00:09:41,375
You know what it is?

90
00:09:43,505 --> 00:09:46,781
I can't remember the last time
we fell asleep together.

91
00:09:49,425 --> 00:09:50,380
Baby....

92
00:09:52,065 --> 00:09:53,214
It's my job.

93
00:09:53,465 --> 00:09:54,659
That's required.

94
00:09:55,065 --> 00:09:57,977
I'm a better cop when
I get some in the morning.

95
00:09:58,225 --> 00:09:59,578
I feel lighter on my feet.

96
00:09:59,825 --> 00:10:02,783
Keep it in your pants.
I hear 3 little Burnetts coming.

97
00:10:03,105 --> 00:10:04,220
That's cold.

98
00:10:04,545 --> 00:10:06,422
You leave me here
like a humping dog.

99
00:10:08,145 --> 00:10:09,703
Hi, baby boy!

100
00:10:11,185 --> 00:10:12,698
-Daddy! Daddy!
-What's up?

101
00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:22,663
At school, people say l look weird.
They say my ears look funny.

102
00:10:22,945 --> 00:10:26,574
I have that problem, I got the ears.
But you know what?

103
00:10:26,825 --> 00:10:29,055
They for you to listen
to people's problems.

104
00:10:29,265 --> 00:10:32,701
You're an angel.
These are your wings.

105
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:36,023
James, stop!
Would you take them off?.

106
00:10:37,585 --> 00:10:40,782
Don't make me come to your school.
I'll arrest the principal.

107
00:10:42,425 --> 00:10:43,938
Talking about my boy's ears.

108
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:46,819
Uncle Mike's in the house!

109
00:10:47,225 --> 00:10:48,453
What's up?

110
00:10:48,865 --> 00:10:50,378
Partner, partner!

111
00:10:50,905 --> 00:10:51,860
Check it out.

112
00:10:52,305 --> 00:10:54,421
What'd you take my food for?

113
00:10:55,425 --> 00:10:58,098
Don't! I don't know where
your lips were last night.

114
00:11:00,425 --> 00:11:02,177
Did you have a date last night?

115
00:11:02,425 --> 00:11:04,143
Did I!

116
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,104
Let me tell you.
This girl was--

117
00:11:07,185 --> 00:11:09,574
Don't tell my son
your sleazy sex stories.

118
00:11:09,825 --> 00:11:12,464
I only tell your husband
my sleazy sex stories.

119
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,855
Him neither.
It gives him ideas.

120
00:11:15,185 --> 00:11:18,382
Why put me in this?
I'm with my babies.

121
00:11:18,585 --> 00:11:19,779
Okay? Thank you.

122
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:22,300
Eat. Go on!

123
00:11:22,745 --> 00:11:23,734
No problem.

124
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:29,660
Mike here.

125
00:11:31,985 --> 00:11:35,660
Captain, I think you mean,
"Get our asses down there, please."

126
00:11:37,665 --> 00:11:38,461
Maybe not.

127
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:49,421
Hey, baby!

128
00:11:50,225 --> 00:11:51,374
Where's Howard?

129
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:54,458
He's looking for you.
He's been in better moods.

130
00:11:57,185 --> 00:11:58,743
Damn!

131
00:11:59,065 --> 00:12:01,181
Get it done, goddamn it!

132
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,217
Welcome to our nightmare.

133
00:12:05,705 --> 00:12:06,854
See this?

134
00:12:07,265 --> 00:12:09,096
What's wrong with this picture?

135
00:12:10,425 --> 00:12:11,221
Remember this room?

136
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:14,256
These flats look familiar?

137
00:12:14,505 --> 00:12:17,497
There were these silver packets
that looked like bricks.

138
00:12:17,825 --> 00:12:19,895
Little red tags on them,
about so high?

139
00:12:20,345 --> 00:12:21,460
All that heroin, gone!

140
00:12:22,185 --> 00:12:24,096
Our career bust.
$100 million!

141
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:26,383
-Gone!
-This is bad.

142
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,900
Let me call it what it is:
Fucked up!

143
00:12:29,145 --> 00:12:30,624
You got that right.

144
00:12:31,465 --> 00:12:32,454
Hello, Alison.

145
00:12:32,745 --> 00:12:36,294
You know Captain Sinclair,
Internal Affairs's top watchdog.

146
00:12:36,545 --> 00:12:39,059
I'd take that as a compliment,
but I know you.

147
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,940
If you two want to get personal,
we could step out--

148
00:12:43,265 --> 00:12:45,779
It's nothing personal.
I'm just doing my job.

149
00:12:46,385 --> 00:12:50,981
I know one leak can turn
this nightmare into a media frenzy.

150
00:12:51,225 --> 00:12:54,740
That won't happen.
We'll get the dope back before that.

151
00:12:55,385 --> 00:12:58,183
Start by looking here.
It had to be an inside job.

152
00:12:58,785 --> 00:13:00,343
I'll find out about it.

153
00:13:01,225 --> 00:13:03,341
Sanchez, Ruiz, you're late.

154
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,777
So they put this in for
toxic drug fumes?

155
00:13:09,585 --> 00:13:11,257
Brilliant design!

156
00:13:11,465 --> 00:13:13,376
This was intelligent.
I like this.

157
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:16,139
I didn't ask how he feels.
What did he see?

158
00:13:16,385 --> 00:13:17,659
What does he know?.

159
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:20,978
Where were you last night?

160
00:13:21,225 --> 00:13:24,183
Have your cousins bring it back
and we can sleep.

161
00:13:24,465 --> 00:13:27,025
We were going to,
but we found a problem.

162
00:13:27,225 --> 00:13:29,136
Your mama snorted up all the dope.

163
00:13:29,705 --> 00:13:31,138
Get over there.

164
00:13:33,785 --> 00:13:35,980
O'Fee is okay
but has nothing to tell us.

165
00:13:36,305 --> 00:13:39,661
They kill a decoy, it empties
the station. Very smart!

166
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:43,022
But not a real cop, or the
whole force would be on them.

167
00:13:43,265 --> 00:13:45,620
This was your case.
You're back on it.

168
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,334
Sanchez, Ruiz, back them up
with whatever they need.

169
00:13:48,665 --> 00:13:50,303
Shut your mouths!

170
00:13:50,545 --> 00:13:53,901
It was Carrera's drugs
in the first place.

171
00:13:54,145 --> 00:13:57,182
But he was killed in prison.
What about his crew?.

172
00:13:57,465 --> 00:14:00,457
Those idiots don't have
the precision to do this.

173
00:14:00,665 --> 00:14:02,178
But check them out.

174
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:06,213
They would have been
in here with Uzis.

175
00:14:06,425 --> 00:14:07,938
It takes brains do this.

176
00:14:08,185 --> 00:14:10,176
Big cojones too.

177
00:14:10,385 --> 00:14:11,864
What do you mean?

178
00:14:12,105 --> 00:14:14,494
It would take a month to explain.

179
00:14:19,145 --> 00:14:22,103
We've got nothing.
What's the matter with you?

180
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,459
The guy who pulled this off
knew what he was doing.

181
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,901
He left us a big "Fuck you."

182
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:32,657
Find out who installed
the ventilating system.

183
00:14:35,425 --> 00:14:36,938
-That's cold.
-So's your mama's bed.

184
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,179
This could definitely be
an inside job.

185
00:14:42,225 --> 00:14:46,343
We got 72 hours before the FBI and DEA
come and shut us down.

186
00:14:46,865 --> 00:14:48,059
We'll be the bad guys.

187
00:14:48,585 --> 00:14:49,734
The politics demand...

188
00:14:49,945 --> 00:14:52,584
...that somebody take the rap,
and it'll be us.

189
00:14:53,505 --> 00:14:56,303
Just do what you do.
Only faster.

190
00:14:56,545 --> 00:14:59,423
Jojo, you still a chemist, right?

191
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:01,064
Cutting drugs and shit like that?

192
00:15:01,305 --> 00:15:04,980
I don't know about that.
I'm out of the drug business.

193
00:15:05,225 --> 00:15:06,817
You know something.

194
00:15:07,025 --> 00:15:08,777
I just said "no" to drugs.

195
00:15:09,465 --> 00:15:11,774
You said "no" to drugs!
What you into, Jo?

196
00:15:12,025 --> 00:15:13,014
Rubber.

197
00:15:13,225 --> 00:15:15,534
You're selling tires, huh?

198
00:15:15,945 --> 00:15:18,778
You know nothing?
Jojo don't know nothing.

199
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:20,179
I know tires.

200
00:15:20,425 --> 00:15:23,383
-You telling the truth?
-Would I lie to you?

201
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,375
Hey! You driving.

202
00:15:32,785 --> 00:15:34,423
This is a waste of time.

203
00:15:34,665 --> 00:15:39,261
In Maxie's line of work
she definitely gets the 411 .

204
00:15:39,545 --> 00:15:42,821
Maxie! How'd I know
I'd find you here?

205
00:15:46,505 --> 00:15:48,894
We got to talk.
Where can we talk?

206
00:15:49,185 --> 00:15:50,584
The equipment room?

207
00:15:51,145 --> 00:15:52,897
-Behave yourself.
-I'm cool.

208
00:16:03,585 --> 00:16:06,383
Listen, I need some help.
Again.

209
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:07,978
What else is new?.

210
00:16:19,105 --> 00:16:22,734
Some major ill shit
happened down at the P.D.

211
00:16:22,985 --> 00:16:25,624
There's lots of heroin
and cash involved.

212
00:16:25,865 --> 00:16:28,743
There'll be some jolly young men
who want to party.

213
00:16:28,985 --> 00:16:30,338
What do you need?

214
00:16:30,585 --> 00:16:32,735
Lots of people
will talk to you, not me.

215
00:16:33,385 --> 00:16:35,694
You mean customers?

216
00:16:35,905 --> 00:16:39,341
Don't get in any wild shit.
Just call if you hear something.

217
00:16:41,225 --> 00:16:42,419
I think I will.

218
00:16:52,305 --> 00:16:53,784
What are you doing?

219
00:16:54,025 --> 00:16:55,697
Trying to keep my shit quick.

220
00:16:56,105 --> 00:16:59,984
Right, you ain't getting none at home.
You got extra energy.

221
00:17:01,945 --> 00:17:03,378
We got anything?

222
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:06,822
Sanchez says the air conditioning
contract went to...

223
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:08,822
...Manuel Arrona of Key Biscayne.

224
00:17:09,745 --> 00:17:12,782
He works out of his house this week.
That's the number.

225
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:21,018
He's not answering.

226
00:17:21,545 --> 00:17:23,615
I guess we should leave.

227
00:17:23,825 --> 00:17:27,181
Make a trip all the way here
to high society for nothing?

228
00:17:27,465 --> 00:17:29,581
No, man.
We can peek in the windows.

229
00:17:29,825 --> 00:17:31,019
That's okay.

230
00:17:36,465 --> 00:17:38,854
-I tripped.
-The handle just opened?

231
00:17:39,065 --> 00:17:42,262
Right after I tripped.
They must want us to come in.

232
00:17:42,465 --> 00:17:43,739
Take a peek.

233
00:17:44,945 --> 00:17:46,503
Hello!

234
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:48,777
We're your new neighbours.

235
00:17:49,665 --> 00:17:51,542
Don't be alarmed.
We're Negroes.

236
00:17:51,785 --> 00:17:54,345
No man!
Too much bass in your voice.

237
00:17:54,585 --> 00:17:56,815
That scares white folks.
Sound like them.

238
00:17:57,425 --> 00:18:00,417
We were wondering if we can
borrow some brown sugar.

239
00:18:06,865 --> 00:18:07,661
You fart?

240
00:18:08,025 --> 00:18:09,504
No, man!

241
00:18:11,385 --> 00:18:12,818
Dead guy.

242
00:18:23,465 --> 00:18:25,296
Looks like somebody's home.

243
00:18:34,545 --> 00:18:36,900
Let me take a stab at this one.

244
00:18:37,425 --> 00:18:39,655
He sells the ventilation plans
to the bad guys.

245
00:18:39,905 --> 00:18:42,942
-He gets rich, but dead.
-You're right on that.

246
00:18:43,585 --> 00:18:45,974
-I'm going to go call homicide.
-Wait!

247
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:48,136
Why do you act like this
around corpses?

248
00:18:48,385 --> 00:18:50,580
It's cool. I just--

249
00:18:51,425 --> 00:18:52,778
Please? Look around.

250
00:18:54,385 --> 00:18:55,977
The smell and the--

251
00:18:56,905 --> 00:18:58,418
It's just unexpected.

252
00:19:07,785 --> 00:19:10,379
It's looks like our buddy Arrona
was a gambler.

253
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,217
Got dog track, jai alai....

254
00:19:12,465 --> 00:19:15,502
-Needed money to pay his debts.
-Bookie.

255
00:19:19,385 --> 00:19:20,534
Damn, man!

256
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:22,423
Watch where you swing
the dead leg!

257
00:19:22,665 --> 00:19:23,939
My bad, my bad!

258
00:19:24,185 --> 00:19:26,574
Damn this.
I'm calling homicide.

259
00:19:26,825 --> 00:19:28,497
I'm a narcotics cop.

260
00:19:31,385 --> 00:19:33,341
Dead bodies...

261
00:19:35,585 --> 00:19:36,779
...dead ends.

262
00:19:42,785 --> 00:19:43,820
Maggots.

263
00:19:47,665 --> 00:19:48,495
What's wrong?

264
00:20:02,825 --> 00:20:04,736
Want to grab some burritos?

265
00:20:07,265 --> 00:20:10,655
You drive slow enough
to drive Miss Daisy.

266
00:20:12,865 --> 00:20:15,584
Man, the transaction is done.

267
00:20:15,785 --> 00:20:17,901
We ain't got shit. It's over.

268
00:20:18,185 --> 00:20:20,460
We got it before, we'll get it again.

269
00:20:20,745 --> 00:20:22,975
Got it all figured out, don't you?

270
00:20:23,225 --> 00:20:24,738
You got to have faith.

271
00:20:24,985 --> 00:20:28,216
By the time we figured out how,
we'd be out of a job.

272
00:20:28,465 --> 00:20:32,583
Scratch that! Everybody in
the unit will be out of a job!

273
00:20:32,825 --> 00:20:34,383
But don't worry!

274
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:37,458
They tend to think
Mike Lowrey going to be all right.

275
00:20:37,705 --> 00:20:41,584
Especially since they think
you some rich kid playing cop.

276
00:20:42,305 --> 00:20:44,865
Look, man, I ain't got no trust fund.

277
00:20:45,105 --> 00:20:48,177
See, for me, no job, no check.

278
00:20:48,465 --> 00:20:50,774
That's like all the other guys
in the unit.

279
00:20:51,065 --> 00:20:52,180
At least, most of us.

280
00:20:52,545 --> 00:20:54,536
So I'm playing cop now?.

281
00:20:55,785 --> 00:20:57,616
This is a game?
I'm just joking?

282
00:20:57,865 --> 00:21:00,584
You always wanting to be
Starsky or Hutch.

283
00:21:02,785 --> 00:21:03,979
You know what?

284
00:21:04,225 --> 00:21:06,580
I'm so sick of this bullshit!

285
00:21:06,825 --> 00:21:10,135
I'm supposed to apologize
for my family leaving me money?!

286
00:21:10,385 --> 00:21:12,740
All I ever wanted to be was a cop!

287
00:21:12,985 --> 00:21:15,215
I take it to the max every day.

288
00:21:15,465 --> 00:21:18,377
I'm the first guy in and the last
to leave a crime scene.

289
00:21:18,665 --> 00:21:20,735
So fuck you! And fuck them!

290
00:21:20,985 --> 00:21:24,182
And fuck anybody who got
a problem with Mike Lowrey!

291
00:21:26,225 --> 00:21:28,534
-I love you, man.
-Fuck you, Marcus.

292
00:21:31,345 --> 00:21:32,573
I do.

293
00:21:32,825 --> 00:21:34,178
You're cool, man.

294
00:21:34,465 --> 00:21:36,660
-You're my partner.
-Shut up.

295
00:21:36,945 --> 00:21:38,094
Slow-ass driver.

296
00:21:38,345 --> 00:21:40,984
-Driving like a bitch.
-Why I got to be all that?

297
00:21:41,225 --> 00:21:42,214
Slow-ass.

298
00:21:42,465 --> 00:21:45,502
I'll take us off this cliff,
keep fucking with me.

299
00:21:46,345 --> 00:21:48,779
Then it would be, what,
two bitches in the sea?

300
00:21:49,025 --> 00:21:51,300
-Is that what you want?
-Shut up.

301
00:21:51,545 --> 00:21:53,740
My wife know I ain't no bitch.

302
00:21:55,265 --> 00:21:56,744
I'm a bad boy.

303
00:21:56,985 --> 00:22:00,455
Bad boys, bad boys
What you going to do?

304
00:22:00,705 --> 00:22:03,219
What you going to do
When they come for you?

305
00:22:03,465 --> 00:22:05,421
Only models and that's all.

306
00:22:05,665 --> 00:22:08,384
Max just dropped by.
I got to go.

307
00:22:10,265 --> 00:22:13,701
You want me to call around
looking for the newly rich?

308
00:22:13,945 --> 00:22:17,620
Are there any new guys partying a lot,
spending lots of money?

309
00:22:17,865 --> 00:22:19,935
This guy called me today, desperate...

310
00:22:20,185 --> 00:22:23,382
...looking for new girls in town.
Are you available?

311
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:25,217
It'll be a quick $2,000.

312
00:22:25,465 --> 00:22:26,534
I got plans with Julie.

313
00:22:26,785 --> 00:22:28,662
She's your roommate, right?

314
00:22:28,905 --> 00:22:30,975
Bring her.
She's cute, she's sexy.

315
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:32,783
She's not a working girl.

316
00:22:33,025 --> 00:22:34,583
He's on speedballs.

317
00:22:34,825 --> 00:22:36,895
He probably can't get it up.

318
00:22:37,145 --> 00:22:38,976
Maybe we'll go check it out.

319
00:22:39,225 --> 00:22:41,341
Could be the party I'm looking for.

320
00:22:42,145 --> 00:22:44,784
A party at the Biltmore.
That'll really rock.

321
00:22:45,065 --> 00:22:46,418
I owe you one.

322
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:50,340
I'll just deduct it from
the hundreds of favours I owe you.

323
00:22:51,065 --> 00:22:52,976
Am I becoming a guest who won't leave?

324
00:22:53,225 --> 00:22:55,295
No, I like having you live with me.

325
00:22:55,545 --> 00:22:58,457
I'm an out-of-work photographer
who can't cook.

326
00:22:58,785 --> 00:23:00,980
Not a big upside for you there.

327
00:23:01,225 --> 00:23:04,979
What hip individual inspired
this visit to the Biltmore?

328
00:23:05,225 --> 00:23:06,340
It's a favour for Mike Lowrey.

329
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:10,180
The cop I think you're
a little bit in love with.

330
00:23:10,465 --> 00:23:13,775
Maybe I am.
But we're just friends.

331
00:23:14,065 --> 00:23:17,057
If I were in trouble,
he's the person I'd call.

332
00:23:17,305 --> 00:23:20,058
I know, I know.
I've heard this before.

333
00:23:24,265 --> 00:23:26,381
You must be Max. Welcome.

334
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:28,183
I'm Eddie.

335
00:23:28,465 --> 00:23:30,501
To the Al Capone suite.

336
00:23:30,745 --> 00:23:33,498
I guess we're a little early.

337
00:23:33,905 --> 00:23:34,894
This is Julie.

338
00:23:38,025 --> 00:23:40,016
You like Al Capone, don't you?

339
00:23:41,065 --> 00:23:42,783
I hadn't thought about it.

340
00:23:44,665 --> 00:23:47,054
I'm not kidding
about this being Capone's.

341
00:23:47,305 --> 00:23:51,059
He had the place
rigged with secret passageways.

342
00:23:51,585 --> 00:23:53,064
10 minutes, we're gone.

343
00:23:53,345 --> 00:23:54,460
Five.

344
00:23:54,745 --> 00:23:56,622
-One drink.
-One sip.

345
00:23:58,665 --> 00:24:00,018
Just girl chat.

346
00:24:00,265 --> 00:24:01,778
Where's the bathroom?

347
00:24:02,545 --> 00:24:04,217
Upstairs on your right.

348
00:24:05,265 --> 00:24:06,823
Watch your step.

349
00:24:08,705 --> 00:24:09,501
Come.

350
00:24:10,265 --> 00:24:11,300
Sit.

351
00:24:12,025 --> 00:24:14,061
Enjoy yourself. Relax.

352
00:24:14,305 --> 00:24:16,865
Eddie's got some favors
to play with.

353
00:24:18,025 --> 00:24:19,060
That he does.

354
00:24:19,305 --> 00:24:21,865
I should've told you about his party.

355
00:24:22,105 --> 00:24:24,983
Well, now it's a surprise party.

356
00:24:31,665 --> 00:24:35,453
Okay, Max, I think we've been here
about 5 minutes too long.

357
00:24:40,785 --> 00:24:43,583
I see you treat yourself well, Eddie.

358
00:24:48,505 --> 00:24:51,383
I needed to blow off
a little steam after...

359
00:24:51,665 --> 00:24:53,542
...the move, you know.

360
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:56,379
So a little party with
a few friends, that's all.

361
00:24:57,185 --> 00:24:59,335
I was going to invite you guys.

362
00:24:59,825 --> 00:25:00,860
Invite?

363
00:25:01,105 --> 00:25:03,175
Looks like I'm catering this.

364
00:25:05,225 --> 00:25:08,376
I was looking for my 2 keys of dope.
Now I know where they are.

365
00:25:08,625 --> 00:25:10,775
Yours? It's our score.

366
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:15,137
-And the girl?
-Nobody.

367
00:25:15,785 --> 00:25:17,377
Just entertainment.

368
00:25:17,825 --> 00:25:18,814
I'm Max.

369
00:25:19,465 --> 00:25:20,580
Nice to meet you.

370
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:26,379
I like a woman who
takes pride in her appearance.

371
00:25:28,425 --> 00:25:29,699
Don't you?

372
00:25:30,865 --> 00:25:33,379
I hate when
a bitch lets herself slide.

373
00:25:34,785 --> 00:25:37,140
You look like a model in that dress.

374
00:25:37,385 --> 00:25:38,613
Will you model for me?

375
00:25:45,985 --> 00:25:48,453
Oh, great!
It's the goon squad.

376
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:17,344
You were a cop.
You should know hookers talk.

377
00:26:17,665 --> 00:26:20,338
You couldn't wait 4 more days
until I made the deal?

378
00:26:20,585 --> 00:26:23,895
I can't work with
that kind of stupidity.

379
00:26:24,345 --> 00:26:26,461
I got you connected inside.

380
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:29,894
I brought you my family.

381
00:26:33,065 --> 00:26:34,180
It's my family now.

382
00:26:35,665 --> 00:26:36,984
We're still friends.

383
00:26:38,385 --> 00:26:40,979
-What're you guys doing?
-You pissed him off.

384
00:26:44,025 --> 00:26:45,663
You got blood on me again.

385
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:48,020
Someone's there!

386
00:26:51,065 --> 00:26:52,054
Get her!

387
00:26:57,545 --> 00:26:58,580
Get her!

388
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:09,819
What the fuck?!

389
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:29,584
Shoot her!

390
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:47,814
-I got her.
-I got her!

391
00:27:48,065 --> 00:27:51,375
-Bullshit!
-What do you know about shooting?

392
00:27:51,585 --> 00:27:53,303
I can't believe she made it!

393
00:27:53,865 --> 00:27:55,344
Are you serious?

394
00:27:55,585 --> 00:27:56,700
She jumped.

395
00:27:56,985 --> 00:27:58,100
Fuck!

396
00:27:59,105 --> 00:28:02,381
Find out who she worked for,
and find out where she lives.

397
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,942
It's about fucking time!

398
00:28:15,625 --> 00:28:18,901
Come here, look at this.
See this guy?

399
00:28:19,385 --> 00:28:20,534
He's dead, right?

400
00:28:20,785 --> 00:28:22,855
-Look familiar?
-Eddie Dominguez.

401
00:28:23,145 --> 00:28:24,976
-The ex-cop.
-Two points for you.

402
00:28:25,225 --> 00:28:27,375
And there's high-grade
heroin over there.

403
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:30,179
That's a headline Sinclair will love.

404
00:28:30,385 --> 00:28:32,137
No sign of forced entry.

405
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:34,581
What is this? Looks like Beirut.

406
00:28:34,825 --> 00:28:36,338
It's the Al Capone suite.

407
00:28:37,025 --> 00:28:38,617
What can I say? Shit happens.

408
00:28:39,345 --> 00:28:40,937
It's a shitty day.

409
00:28:41,145 --> 00:28:42,339
Real shitty day.

410
00:28:42,665 --> 00:28:45,577
We've got two shades
of lipstick over here.

411
00:28:45,825 --> 00:28:47,497
Someone's missing from the party.

412
00:28:47,905 --> 00:28:49,224
Listen to me.

413
00:28:49,465 --> 00:28:52,980
Your only function in life now
is to find that person.

414
00:28:53,225 --> 00:28:55,295
It's the only lead we have.

415
00:28:55,545 --> 00:28:57,979
I'll check all calls to the room.

416
00:29:08,385 --> 00:29:10,376
What you got over there?

417
00:29:21,105 --> 00:29:22,458
Cover her.

418
00:29:25,825 --> 00:29:27,463
He knew the girl?

419
00:29:41,825 --> 00:29:44,544
We'll get the witness
and get the fools who did this.

420
00:29:45,425 --> 00:29:47,655
See if you can
catch a ride with Howard.

421
00:29:47,905 --> 00:29:48,894
Where you going?

422
00:29:49,985 --> 00:29:53,375
Checking calls made to Lois Fields.
Maxie worked for her.

423
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,662
-I'll come with you.
-No, we'll catch up later.

424
00:29:57,665 --> 00:29:58,541
You okay?

425
00:29:59,745 --> 00:30:00,860
I'm cool.

426
00:30:08,665 --> 00:30:09,859
Hello?

427
00:30:16,225 --> 00:30:17,260
Shit!

428
00:30:21,465 --> 00:30:25,538
Look, baby, I know
quality time was my idea.

429
00:30:25,785 --> 00:30:27,457
Don't talk about it.

430
00:30:27,705 --> 00:30:28,774
Hold on, babe.

431
00:30:29,025 --> 00:30:32,301
I need a full file on Eddie Dominguez.

432
00:30:32,545 --> 00:30:33,580
Just a minute.

433
00:30:33,825 --> 00:30:35,622
I got on the red one.

434
00:30:35,905 --> 00:30:39,136
The red one? With the snaps?
Couldn't you wait?

435
00:30:39,385 --> 00:30:40,613
You're never home.

436
00:30:41,425 --> 00:30:42,778
All his files are blocked.

437
00:30:43,025 --> 00:30:47,098
I don't care about his personal files.
He's dead. Unblock it.

438
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:48,778
Screw you, that's illegal.

439
00:30:49,025 --> 00:30:50,458
No, screw you!

440
00:30:52,345 --> 00:30:53,983
Are you talking to me?

441
00:30:54,225 --> 00:30:58,696
No, it's a term you use.
"Screw you" is a cop term.

442
00:30:58,945 --> 00:31:00,663
You ain't screwing nothing!

443
00:31:00,905 --> 00:31:02,463
Goddamn it!

444
00:31:05,945 --> 00:31:07,139
Where's Lowrey?

445
00:31:07,865 --> 00:31:09,457
I just paged him.

446
00:31:09,705 --> 00:31:11,900
He's following up
this Lois Fields lead.

447
00:31:12,145 --> 00:31:13,134
The madam?

448
00:31:28,025 --> 00:31:30,778
Requesting backup.
61 4 Reach Road.

449
00:32:04,665 --> 00:32:05,654
That might be him.

450
00:32:08,465 --> 00:32:10,183
Lowrey's desk.

451
00:32:10,425 --> 00:32:12,985
I need to talk
to Detective Mike Lowrey.

452
00:32:13,225 --> 00:32:14,817
Can I help you?

453
00:32:15,065 --> 00:32:17,420
You can get me Detective Lowrey.

454
00:32:17,825 --> 00:32:19,577
Is this another paternity case?

455
00:32:20,065 --> 00:32:22,533
No, it's another murder case,
you twerp!

456
00:32:22,785 --> 00:32:26,255
You mean the murder case
at the Biltmore tonight?

457
00:32:27,025 --> 00:32:29,300
I've just seen my best friend murdered.

458
00:32:30,345 --> 00:32:32,461
I'll only talk to Mike Lowrey.

459
00:32:32,705 --> 00:32:34,582
Why only Mike Lowrey?

460
00:32:34,865 --> 00:32:38,938
None of your business.
I talk to Lowrey or I blow town.

461
00:32:39,185 --> 00:32:41,062
Mike, phone! Telephone!

462
00:32:41,865 --> 00:32:44,459
He's coming right now.
Hold on.

463
00:32:44,825 --> 00:32:45,541
Talk.

464
00:32:45,825 --> 00:32:46,814
I ain't got time.

465
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:49,340
This is the witness from the hotel.

466
00:32:49,905 --> 00:32:52,783
He just got out of the john.
Hold on.

467
00:32:52,985 --> 00:32:55,818
-Talk to her now or she'll walk.
-I can't be Mike.

468
00:32:56,065 --> 00:32:57,418
She's going to walk out.

469
00:32:57,665 --> 00:32:59,656
-This is our witness.
-Calm down!

470
00:33:04,945 --> 00:33:05,934
Hello.

471
00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:07,820
This is Lowrey.

472
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:11,903
He doesn't talk that way.
Talk like him.

473
00:33:12,105 --> 00:33:14,061
You don't sound sexy enough.

474
00:33:15,345 --> 00:33:16,619
Damn!

475
00:33:18,825 --> 00:33:21,976
You don't know me.
My name's Julie Mott.

476
00:33:22,345 --> 00:33:24,336
I was Max Logan's best friend.

477
00:33:24,665 --> 00:33:26,417
Calm down, calm down.

478
00:33:26,625 --> 00:33:28,183
Talk to me now.

479
00:33:31,385 --> 00:33:34,582
She said if she ever needed anything....

480
00:33:36,825 --> 00:33:38,338
I need your help.

481
00:33:38,665 --> 00:33:39,984
Give me the address.

482
00:33:40,225 --> 00:33:41,658
All right.

483
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,261
It'll be okay.
Mike's to the rescue.

484
00:33:44,505 --> 00:33:45,938
I'm on the way.

485
00:33:46,185 --> 00:33:47,823
-I'll find Lowrey.
-I can't go.

486
00:33:48,065 --> 00:33:49,214
You got to go!

487
00:33:49,465 --> 00:33:51,615
Get Mike to handle this.

488
00:33:51,865 --> 00:33:53,935
Get to this address now.
Get up!

489
00:33:54,185 --> 00:33:56,983
You won't see your wife for a month!
Get up!

490
00:34:09,585 --> 00:34:11,257
Get this fucking door fixed!

491
00:34:18,545 --> 00:34:20,058
Mike Lowrey.

492
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:22,939
No, easy.
Mike Lowrey.

493
00:34:25,425 --> 00:34:26,414
Shit!

494
00:34:27,625 --> 00:34:28,580
Who's there?

495
00:34:29,825 --> 00:34:31,577
Mike Lowrey.

496
00:34:31,905 --> 00:34:33,657
How do I know it's Lowrey?

497
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,055
'Cause, I'm Mike Lowrey!

498
00:34:36,425 --> 00:34:37,983
We ain't got much time.

499
00:34:38,225 --> 00:34:40,375
Hold your badge up to the peephole.

500
00:34:40,905 --> 00:34:43,135
I won't let you in until you do.

501
00:34:50,905 --> 00:34:52,418
No way!

502
00:34:54,345 --> 00:34:56,575
-What was that for?
-You're not him!

503
00:34:56,825 --> 00:34:59,259
What do you mean?!
You've never met him!

504
00:34:59,505 --> 00:35:00,699
Max described you differently!

505
00:35:00,985 --> 00:35:01,701
I'm undercover!

506
00:35:03,265 --> 00:35:04,061
Prove it!

507
00:35:04,305 --> 00:35:08,059
I know Max from way back.
I helped her brother get out of jail.

508
00:35:08,305 --> 00:35:09,340
So?

509
00:35:09,585 --> 00:35:13,624
Sometimes we got together
to bump and grind....

510
00:35:13,865 --> 00:35:15,014
Wrong!

511
00:35:16,265 --> 00:35:17,937
Give me the bat!

512
00:35:18,345 --> 00:35:20,495
Fine!
You don't want to believe me?

513
00:35:21,065 --> 00:35:22,578
You go at this shit alone!

514
00:35:25,385 --> 00:35:26,943
I forgot.

515
00:35:27,185 --> 00:35:29,335
The bad guys probably
know where you live...

516
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:31,979
...and are coming for you.
Good luck!

517
00:35:34,185 --> 00:35:35,937
I saw the whole thing.

518
00:35:37,065 --> 00:35:40,375
I watched him shoot her
like she was nothing.

519
00:35:43,065 --> 00:35:44,259
Shut the door.

520
00:35:49,505 --> 00:35:50,779
Look, lady.

521
00:35:51,545 --> 00:35:53,934
You ain't got
no more bats, golf clubs...

522
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:57,143
...or anything like that
to swing at me, do you?

523
00:35:58,505 --> 00:36:00,018
I knew Max, okay?

524
00:36:00,545 --> 00:36:03,218
I cared about Max also.

525
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:06,975
I'm just here to help you.

526
00:36:09,505 --> 00:36:11,097
You're not what I expected.

527
00:36:12,225 --> 00:36:15,422
I ain't expect to walk
into Yankee Stadium either.

528
00:36:18,665 --> 00:36:21,179
We got to get out of here, okay?
Let's go.

529
00:36:21,745 --> 00:36:23,656
I've got to get my dogs.
Dukie!

530
00:36:25,105 --> 00:36:26,538
Lukie, Dukie, whatever!

531
00:36:26,905 --> 00:36:28,736
You got a back door?

532
00:36:28,985 --> 00:36:30,543
Where we going?

533
00:36:30,785 --> 00:36:31,854
Protective custody.

534
00:36:32,105 --> 00:36:34,665
Fuck that!
I'm only dealing with you.

535
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:37,419
A cop threw that party at the hotel.

536
00:36:37,665 --> 00:36:40,338
Former cop.
We got rid of him long ago.

537
00:36:40,545 --> 00:36:41,580
Come on, Luke!

538
00:36:41,905 --> 00:36:45,659
Listen, if you want to live,
you got to trust me.

539
00:37:17,185 --> 00:37:19,653
Here, doggie!
Come on, doggie!

540
00:37:21,665 --> 00:37:22,654
Who the hell was that?!

541
00:37:23,585 --> 00:37:26,338
There is too much killing going on!

542
00:37:26,705 --> 00:37:27,899
Go after them!

543
00:37:28,185 --> 00:37:29,174
I'll go around front!

544
00:37:31,785 --> 00:37:33,298
Come on, move your ass!

545
00:37:50,625 --> 00:37:51,853
Get in the car!

546
00:37:57,745 --> 00:38:00,213
-Go, goddamn it!
-Fucking door!

547
00:38:00,865 --> 00:38:02,935
Go, goddamn it, go!

548
00:38:09,425 --> 00:38:12,576
How did you miss them?
You fat fuck!

549
00:38:12,785 --> 00:38:14,218
Watch your fucking mouth!

550
00:38:14,465 --> 00:38:16,057
Lose weight, you'd have caught them.

551
00:38:16,305 --> 00:38:18,773
I'd like to squeeze your fucking head.

552
00:38:19,025 --> 00:38:20,777
Now you're fucking in trouble!

553
00:38:21,025 --> 00:38:23,141
-You get the license plate?
-I got the plates.

554
00:38:23,385 --> 00:38:24,738
You cockeyed fuck!

555
00:38:25,985 --> 00:38:28,579
This is a getaway car?
We won't get away from anything!

556
00:38:28,865 --> 00:38:30,981
Is this a family station wagon?

557
00:38:31,265 --> 00:38:34,098
You got a baby seat in the back!

558
00:38:34,505 --> 00:38:36,780
It's an undercover car, okay?

559
00:38:37,345 --> 00:38:39,620
I know they saw my license plate.

560
00:38:40,225 --> 00:38:41,817
Were those the guys who shot Max?

561
00:38:42,025 --> 00:38:44,619
I only saw bullets.
You tell me what they look like.

562
00:38:44,865 --> 00:38:47,425
I was busy trying
to keep a bullet out of you.

563
00:38:48,065 --> 00:38:50,898
I need you to look
through some mug shots...

564
00:38:51,145 --> 00:38:52,942
...to identify Max's shooter.

565
00:38:53,145 --> 00:38:54,897
-Where?
-Protective custody.

566
00:38:55,105 --> 00:38:57,903
I told you I'm not going
into protective custody!

567
00:38:58,145 --> 00:38:59,294
I'm not playing.

568
00:38:59,505 --> 00:39:02,781
You really pissing me off.
I'll book your ass!

569
00:39:03,065 --> 00:39:07,377
I'll develop amnesia. I suddenly
feel a case of it coming on.

570
00:39:07,665 --> 00:39:10,225
Fine, where would you feel safe?

571
00:39:10,465 --> 00:39:12,535
You want to do protective custody?

572
00:39:12,905 --> 00:39:17,103
In-home protective custody,
at your place. I can handle that.

573
00:39:17,505 --> 00:39:19,700
Yeah, my place.
My place is--

574
00:39:19,945 --> 00:39:21,219
No way!

575
00:39:22,945 --> 00:39:23,934
Right!

576
00:39:24,265 --> 00:39:26,859
Yeah, my place is the shit.

577
00:39:27,065 --> 00:39:29,818
Mike Lowrey's place.
You right.

578
00:39:30,305 --> 00:39:33,297
That's the best idea
you came up with tonight.

579
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:37,780
Wait here.

580
00:39:38,025 --> 00:39:39,583
Wait here.

581
00:39:45,025 --> 00:39:46,060
Detective Burnett!

582
00:39:46,265 --> 00:39:49,382
How are you?
Mr. Lowrey's not here.

583
00:39:49,625 --> 00:39:51,695
He said I could use his place.

584
00:39:52,025 --> 00:39:53,822
He didn't mention it to me.

585
00:39:56,705 --> 00:39:58,980
Who's the chick?
How's your wife?

586
00:40:00,905 --> 00:40:02,224
Fine, she's fine.

587
00:40:02,465 --> 00:40:05,298
Your kids, they're good?
Family's the most important thing.

588
00:40:05,745 --> 00:40:06,734
Is it?

589
00:40:06,985 --> 00:40:10,216
Mr. Lowrey said you got a baby factory
going on at your house.

590
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:11,701
Here you go.

591
00:40:12,985 --> 00:40:15,863
If that ain't enough,
I'll run you in for extortion.

592
00:40:16,145 --> 00:40:18,136
You know,
I'm so stupid sometimes.

593
00:40:19,505 --> 00:40:22,463
Now that you mention it,
Mr. Lowrey mentioned you'd come by.

594
00:40:22,705 --> 00:40:24,263
Did he say he had a key?

595
00:40:25,745 --> 00:40:26,655
Hang out.

596
00:40:28,105 --> 00:40:29,174
-Here.
-Is this it?

597
00:40:29,425 --> 00:40:30,301
You're hurting me.

598
00:40:30,745 --> 00:40:33,578
-Thank you. Good to see you.
-Good to see you.

599
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:35,261
Have fun.

600
00:40:36,065 --> 00:40:37,020
It's not like that.

601
00:40:37,785 --> 00:40:39,741
It's not like that.

602
00:40:44,545 --> 00:40:45,580
Come on.

603
00:40:45,825 --> 00:40:48,055
Watch your step up through here.

604
00:40:48,385 --> 00:40:50,580
I must've left some incense burning.

605
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:53,379
Welcome to Casa de Lowrey.

606
00:40:55,065 --> 00:40:56,544
This is kind of....

607
00:40:57,385 --> 00:40:58,738
I'm always moving my switches.

608
00:40:58,985 --> 00:41:01,704
I'm always decorating, so sometimes
I just don't know where shit is.

609
00:41:04,585 --> 00:41:05,620
Shit!

610
00:41:07,105 --> 00:41:08,982
Why am I tripping on shit
I know is there?

611
00:41:11,705 --> 00:41:12,979
You found a light switch.

612
00:41:13,225 --> 00:41:16,217
I should have known it was there
since I decorated the place.

613
00:41:18,145 --> 00:41:19,100
This is Yvette.

614
00:41:19,385 --> 00:41:22,422
Ignore this.
It's one of my freaks, Yvette.

615
00:41:22,665 --> 00:41:24,701
She's always calling,
got to have it.

616
00:41:24,985 --> 00:41:27,453
Don't call here no more now, freak!
Just one of my freaks.

617
00:41:27,705 --> 00:41:30,014
All this on a cop's salary?

618
00:41:30,745 --> 00:41:32,178
Well...

619
00:41:32,705 --> 00:41:33,660
...it's honest money.

620
00:41:33,905 --> 00:41:36,214
I'm a second-generation rich kid.

621
00:41:36,865 --> 00:41:40,938
If you're not in it for the paycheck,
are you an action junkie?

622
00:41:41,705 --> 00:41:43,058
If that what you want to call it.

623
00:41:43,425 --> 00:41:47,054
I don't mind bats swung at my head,
bullets grazing my ass.

624
00:41:47,305 --> 00:41:48,943
Gives me a rush.

625
00:41:49,185 --> 00:41:50,220
Look...

626
00:41:50,465 --> 00:41:52,535
...I'll give you a broad stroke
of the place.

627
00:41:53,025 --> 00:41:56,017
I got some T-bones in the fridge
for Lukie and Dukie....

628
00:41:56,265 --> 00:42:00,975
Sorry, the fridge is this way.
I confuse my own shit.

629
00:42:01,505 --> 00:42:05,134
Wait, are you going to
leave me here alone?

630
00:42:05,385 --> 00:42:06,738
I must go to the P.D.

631
00:42:06,985 --> 00:42:10,102
These are Miami's
peak crime hours, you know.

632
00:42:10,345 --> 00:42:11,539
Apparently.

633
00:42:12,825 --> 00:42:16,977
They said this deal was going down
in 4 days, and I, you know...

634
00:42:17,225 --> 00:42:20,661
...obviously seem to be kind of
a major glitch in their--

635
00:42:22,425 --> 00:42:25,656
You ain't with the bad guys now.
You're with the cops.

636
00:42:25,945 --> 00:42:28,175
With Mike Lowrey. You with the cops.

637
00:42:28,425 --> 00:42:30,700
Everything will be all right.
Trust me.

638
00:42:31,305 --> 00:42:32,863
I'll be back.

639
00:42:33,105 --> 00:42:37,223
I know that it's no time to joke,
but remember in the movie when...?

640
00:42:37,505 --> 00:42:39,541
All right, all right.

641
00:42:40,145 --> 00:42:42,579
Thanks for everything, Mike.

642
00:42:43,825 --> 00:42:45,383
I'm going.

643
00:42:50,585 --> 00:42:52,223
You're one of those in and out guys.

644
00:42:52,505 --> 00:42:54,496
It's not like that, Chet.

645
00:42:54,785 --> 00:42:56,104
-She's a witness.
-Right.

646
00:42:56,385 --> 00:42:58,023
-Keep an eye out.
-No problem.

647
00:42:58,265 --> 00:42:59,823
Listen to me. Hear me.

648
00:43:00,105 --> 00:43:01,424
-Me?
-That's right.

649
00:43:01,705 --> 00:43:06,062
All right, the moment Lowrey gets in,
you have him call me at home.

650
00:43:06,745 --> 00:43:07,973
-At my home.
-Call you at home.

651
00:43:08,225 --> 00:43:09,863
Don't let him go upstairs.

652
00:43:11,105 --> 00:43:11,935
What? But he lives here.

653
00:43:12,505 --> 00:43:14,177
I could lose my job.

654
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,336
Chet, trust me on this, okay?

655
00:43:16,585 --> 00:43:17,620
Call you from here.

656
00:43:17,865 --> 00:43:19,218
Don't let him up.

657
00:43:19,465 --> 00:43:20,898
-No problem.
-lmportant witness.

658
00:43:21,385 --> 00:43:22,181
Thank you.

659
00:43:22,425 --> 00:43:25,815
I got an idea. I'm off in 2 hours,
I could go upstairs...

660
00:43:26,065 --> 00:43:27,100
...and watch the door.

661
00:43:27,345 --> 00:43:29,222
Like cops do in the movies.

662
00:43:29,465 --> 00:43:31,933
I got a magazine and everything.
And I don't let anybody in or out.

663
00:43:34,225 --> 00:43:35,817
All kidding aside, I want to help.

664
00:43:36,065 --> 00:43:38,499
You're helping.
Do that from here. Can you?

665
00:43:39,225 --> 00:43:40,738
Yes, I can.

666
00:43:41,305 --> 00:43:43,694
Fine.
That helps. From here, okay?

667
00:43:44,025 --> 00:43:47,256
It's funny that you ask me,
because I was going to be a cop.

668
00:43:47,505 --> 00:43:50,861
I took the test and everything.
Just didn't work out.

669
00:43:51,105 --> 00:43:52,060
Politics.

670
00:43:53,065 --> 00:43:54,498
I know, you're my deputy.

671
00:43:54,785 --> 00:43:55,820
-I am.
-From here.

672
00:43:56,105 --> 00:43:56,981
Watch out.

673
00:43:57,225 --> 00:43:58,374
Right.

674
00:43:58,825 --> 00:44:00,417
Take care, chief.

675
00:44:01,225 --> 00:44:02,021
I'm a deputy.

676
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:05,302
Don't "honey-baby" me,
you smell like perfume.

677
00:44:07,785 --> 00:44:10,379
And you don't have
your wedding ring on!

678
00:44:12,265 --> 00:44:13,459
Damn!

679
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:16,701
I went undercover...

680
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:20,017
...and it required
taking off the ring.

681
00:44:20,265 --> 00:44:23,780
I got the ring. I put my hand
in my pocket to get it...

682
00:44:24,025 --> 00:44:25,538
...and it's right back on.

683
00:44:27,385 --> 00:44:28,500
Damn!

684
00:44:29,385 --> 00:44:30,818
Can I get a pillow?.

685
00:44:31,105 --> 00:44:34,700
If it isn't the guy
who doesn't return phone calls.

686
00:44:34,945 --> 00:44:37,413
Where you been
the last 12 hours?

687
00:44:37,665 --> 00:44:39,098
I paged you all night!

688
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:41,979
We got a situation here
that you need to know about.

689
00:44:42,185 --> 00:44:43,413
Look, Marcus...

690
00:44:43,705 --> 00:44:47,175
...I got a dead madam, a concussion
and a bad headache.

691
00:44:47,425 --> 00:44:49,893
Let me tell you what I did last night.

692
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:54,297
I had to sleep on my couch.
I woke up with a Power Ranger in my ass.

693
00:44:54,585 --> 00:44:58,100
While we're discussing my ass,
I damn near got it blown off.

694
00:44:58,585 --> 00:45:01,019
The good news is I got a witness.

695
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:04,018
Let me tell you about her.
She likes to--

696
00:45:04,705 --> 00:45:07,060
You sound like a nagging wife.

697
00:45:07,305 --> 00:45:08,818
I'm a nagging...?

698
00:45:09,065 --> 00:45:12,455
See what happens when you go off alone?
You get into shit.

699
00:45:12,705 --> 00:45:15,458
Like shit don't happen
when you're there.

700
00:45:15,705 --> 00:45:17,024
That ain't the point.

701
00:45:17,265 --> 00:45:21,304
If your partner pages you,
you should call him back.

702
00:45:21,545 --> 00:45:23,854
I want to meet the man
who whupped your ass.

703
00:45:24,105 --> 00:45:26,938
I want to meet
who whupped Shaft's ass.

704
00:45:27,185 --> 00:45:30,416
Look at me. You don't know
what I've been through.

705
00:45:30,665 --> 00:45:33,941
My wife kicked me out
of my happy home.

706
00:45:34,185 --> 00:45:36,380
But, no.
You got to go off by yourself.

707
00:45:36,625 --> 00:45:40,618
"I got this, partner, I got this."
Bullshit.

708
00:45:40,865 --> 00:45:43,015
I'm feeling much better,
thanks.

709
00:45:43,305 --> 00:45:44,374
I'll get him.

710
00:45:46,105 --> 00:45:47,015
I'll beat you up.

711
00:45:48,905 --> 00:45:51,544
Did you hear what I said?!

712
00:45:51,785 --> 00:45:54,379
I did, because I was there
when I said it.

713
00:45:55,025 --> 00:45:58,415
I told you.
I told you to secure a witness...

714
00:45:58,665 --> 00:46:00,417
...not shoot up a neighbourhood.

715
00:46:00,665 --> 00:46:04,704
Not to do another dead body.
Just get the dope back, quietly.

716
00:46:05,225 --> 00:46:08,615
This whole situation
is getting out of control.

717
00:46:08,865 --> 00:46:11,060
You're damn right it is!

718
00:46:11,585 --> 00:46:14,895
I had to pass a pop quiz
before she believed I was him.

719
00:46:16,305 --> 00:46:17,499
Going, it's going....

720
00:46:17,745 --> 00:46:19,497
Shit, little off.

721
00:46:20,105 --> 00:46:21,777
I haven't killed anyone today.

722
00:46:23,065 --> 00:46:24,703
Do you want me to yell at you?

723
00:46:25,105 --> 00:46:26,697
Listen, this witness...

724
00:46:27,225 --> 00:46:29,739
...it's the only good news I got,
okay?

725
00:46:29,945 --> 00:46:31,537
You guys are bad news.

726
00:46:31,785 --> 00:46:34,777
What does that mean?
It means if you must be Mike Lowrey...

727
00:46:35,065 --> 00:46:38,216
...I don't give a shit,
that's who you'll be!

728
00:46:38,465 --> 00:46:40,933
Wait a minute,
what the hell is going on?

729
00:46:43,505 --> 00:46:45,655
I was getting them all in
before you came.

730
00:46:45,905 --> 00:46:48,783
Can somebody talk to me, please?
What's going on?

731
00:46:50,665 --> 00:46:53,463
These fools could have seen
my license plate.

732
00:46:53,705 --> 00:46:54,615
Where is she?

733
00:46:57,545 --> 00:46:58,341
His place.

734
00:46:58,585 --> 00:46:59,381
What?

735
00:46:59,625 --> 00:47:01,217
You left her alone?

736
00:47:01,465 --> 00:47:02,978
Our only witness?!

737
00:47:03,225 --> 00:47:05,181
You left a hooker in my apartment?!

738
00:47:05,425 --> 00:47:08,735
The girl is not a hooker,
as far as I know.

739
00:47:08,985 --> 00:47:12,898
I had to stash her somewhere.
Her and her dogs, Luke and Dukie.

740
00:47:13,465 --> 00:47:16,901
You left dogs in my house?
There's dogs and a hooker in my house?

741
00:47:17,185 --> 00:47:19,494
Add some chimps, we'll have a carnival.

742
00:47:19,745 --> 00:47:21,178
-She's not a hooker.
-Respect my stuff.

743
00:47:21,425 --> 00:47:23,256
-Can you please--
-Shut up!

744
00:47:25,225 --> 00:47:28,058
For years, Sinclair has tried
to pin something on me.

745
00:47:28,305 --> 00:47:30,694
I'm always taking it for you.
Do it for me!

746
00:47:34,145 --> 00:47:38,502
If this witness IDs the shooters,
maybe we catch our bad guys.

747
00:47:38,745 --> 00:47:40,497
But until then...

748
00:47:40,745 --> 00:47:41,939
...until then...

749
00:47:42,185 --> 00:47:43,379
...you are Mike Lowrey.

750
00:47:43,625 --> 00:47:45,581
You be him,
that's what you are.

751
00:47:45,825 --> 00:47:47,656
You're him!
I don't want to hear it!

752
00:47:47,905 --> 00:47:49,338
You be you.

753
00:47:49,585 --> 00:47:52,657
But not in front of her!
You're him, you're you!

754
00:47:57,985 --> 00:48:01,295
Can we get a time-out?
Am I the designated homeless?

755
00:48:01,865 --> 00:48:06,063
Does it look like I care?
Whatever it takes, all right?

756
00:48:06,305 --> 00:48:07,101
What did she say to you?

757
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:10,741
The shooters will make their drop
in 4 days? So we got 4 days.

758
00:48:12,305 --> 00:48:14,216
What kind of plan is that?

759
00:48:14,465 --> 00:48:16,342
I can't be shacked up with her.

760
00:48:16,585 --> 00:48:19,861
I have a family to look after.
My wife will kill my ass.

761
00:48:20,585 --> 00:48:23,099
You don't like your job, quit!

762
00:48:25,105 --> 00:48:26,220
Damn!

763
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:30,494
I'll stay at the house
with Theresa and the kids.

764
00:48:30,785 --> 00:48:35,097
Thanks, but no thanks.
You won't last 5 minutes with my family.

765
00:48:35,425 --> 00:48:39,054
Married life is easy.
You only got one woman to satisfy.

766
00:48:41,025 --> 00:48:42,504
Yo, man...

767
00:48:42,745 --> 00:48:44,019
...we ain't the Cosbys.

768
00:48:44,625 --> 00:48:46,581
Let's go, I got this.

769
00:48:46,825 --> 00:48:47,780
Go.

770
00:48:50,225 --> 00:48:52,580
Everybody wants to be like Mike.

771
00:48:52,825 --> 00:48:55,498
You're going to be retired
like him too.

772
00:48:55,945 --> 00:48:58,175
I'd have dunked it on your ass.

773
00:48:59,065 --> 00:48:59,941
Cleveland?

774
00:49:00,705 --> 00:49:04,744
I never-- Look, woman,
I done told you...

775
00:49:04,985 --> 00:49:06,623
...it's a federal subpoena.

776
00:49:06,825 --> 00:49:08,019
Am I going to tell them no?

777
00:49:08,265 --> 00:49:10,620
I don't know. Why can't he go?

778
00:49:10,865 --> 00:49:12,093
Why can't you go?

779
00:49:12,345 --> 00:49:16,054
I wanted to, but Captain Howard said
I'm irresponsi--

780
00:49:16,305 --> 00:49:19,900
No, he said, "loose cannon."
Because I be shooting in public.

781
00:49:20,145 --> 00:49:21,294
Out of nowhere sometimes.

782
00:49:21,545 --> 00:49:22,898
No, man.

783
00:49:23,305 --> 00:49:24,784
Please. All right.

784
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:29,497
Look. The neighborhood
has lots of break-ins.

785
00:49:29,745 --> 00:49:31,337
I can handle it.

786
00:49:31,585 --> 00:49:35,578
I know, but I'm worrying about me.
Mike's going to stay here.

787
00:49:36,345 --> 00:49:39,064
Take care of y'all.
Just till I come back.

788
00:49:39,305 --> 00:49:42,661
Who'll pick up the kids from day care?
Mike can't do it.

789
00:49:42,905 --> 00:49:45,294
Are you listening to me?

790
00:49:45,545 --> 00:49:48,582
I read a book
that could probably help y'all.

791
00:49:49,545 --> 00:49:51,900
Can you go down and have a Coke?

792
00:49:52,145 --> 00:49:53,294
Please!

793
00:49:53,545 --> 00:49:54,455
All right.

794
00:49:56,105 --> 00:49:56,901
Want something?

795
00:49:58,785 --> 00:49:59,661
Bring me a Coke.

796
00:49:59,905 --> 00:50:00,735
Want one?

797
00:50:00,985 --> 00:50:02,100
I'm fine, thanks.

798
00:50:03,865 --> 00:50:05,344
All right.

799
00:50:10,145 --> 00:50:14,343
Explain it to me. There's a problem
with our chemistry set?

800
00:50:14,585 --> 00:50:15,904
It's not a chemistry set.

801
00:50:16,305 --> 00:50:18,819
He knows it ain't a chemistry set.

802
00:50:23,545 --> 00:50:24,660
So what is it?

803
00:50:24,905 --> 00:50:27,544
The cutting agent
is a highly volatile...

804
00:50:28,185 --> 00:50:29,095
...substance.

805
00:50:29,385 --> 00:50:30,738
-I don't care.
-The ether--

806
00:50:30,985 --> 00:50:32,657
I don't care! I don't care!

807
00:50:32,905 --> 00:50:35,977
I'm not
a fucking chemistry teacher.

808
00:50:36,305 --> 00:50:37,294
What is the problem?!

809
00:50:37,545 --> 00:50:40,264
There's too much moisture down here.

810
00:50:40,505 --> 00:50:42,257
It's totally fucked.

811
00:50:42,505 --> 00:50:43,460
Shut up!

812
00:50:44,585 --> 00:50:45,495
Okay.

813
00:50:45,705 --> 00:50:46,774
What else?

814
00:50:47,025 --> 00:50:50,904
It's taking longer to cook
than we planned. If we rush it...

815
00:50:51,185 --> 00:50:52,584
...we can't sell the drugs.

816
00:50:52,945 --> 00:50:55,778
You're fucking with my timetable.
I gave you a deadline.

817
00:50:55,985 --> 00:50:56,895
Understand?

818
00:50:57,145 --> 00:50:58,783
-Do you understand?!
-I do.

819
00:51:09,425 --> 00:51:10,699
You dressed?

820
00:51:11,505 --> 00:51:13,063
Yeah, I am.

821
00:51:13,305 --> 00:51:17,742
We must go through some mug shots.
I'll hook into the computer.

822
00:51:17,985 --> 00:51:20,977
-And we can do this.
-Who's that guy in the photos?

823
00:51:23,625 --> 00:51:27,857
Sometimes I don't look
and forget all those pictures was here.

824
00:51:28,105 --> 00:51:31,859
That's my partner. That's my partner,
Marcus Burnett.

825
00:51:32,665 --> 00:51:35,133
I've never seen anything
like this before.

826
00:51:35,385 --> 00:51:38,024
I see how it may throw you
a little bit.

827
00:51:38,265 --> 00:51:39,664
It's a cop thing.

828
00:51:39,905 --> 00:51:42,738
These pictures are here for
each time he saved my life.

829
00:51:42,985 --> 00:51:47,263
It's the same with him.
At his place, just pictures of me.

830
00:51:47,665 --> 00:51:49,895
It's like a shrine. Just a reminder.

831
00:51:51,385 --> 00:51:55,981
When I saw it, the whole wall,
I thought maybe they were...

832
00:51:56,545 --> 00:51:57,694
...pictures of your lover.

833
00:51:58,545 --> 00:51:59,534
Who?

834
00:51:59,785 --> 00:52:01,343
I thought you were gay.

835
00:52:02,785 --> 00:52:03,661
Gay?

836
00:52:04,385 --> 00:52:05,374
Nah, nah, nah.

837
00:52:06,905 --> 00:52:10,739
I didn't mean to offend you.
It's okay to be a homosexual.

838
00:52:10,985 --> 00:52:14,614
You're not listening.
It's not registering.

839
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:18,904
Believe me. Did you sleep in the bed?
You didn't feel the dents?

840
00:52:19,145 --> 00:52:20,703
The dents come from that.

841
00:52:20,945 --> 00:52:22,264
That's how I gets down.

842
00:52:22,505 --> 00:52:23,699
That's...

843
00:52:23,945 --> 00:52:24,900
...sweet.

844
00:52:25,385 --> 00:52:29,139
I'm gay. If I was, I'd change the drapes
in this motherfucker.

845
00:52:31,105 --> 00:52:32,015
No.

846
00:52:37,105 --> 00:52:39,096
-You want some?
-No, thanks.

847
00:52:39,345 --> 00:52:41,063
I don't eat flesh.

848
00:52:41,705 --> 00:52:42,694
What?

849
00:52:43,265 --> 00:52:45,142
That's flesh that you're...

850
00:52:45,385 --> 00:52:46,784
...shoveling in your mouth.

851
00:52:47,025 --> 00:52:51,655
That was a living, breathing creature.
It probably had a name.

852
00:52:53,865 --> 00:52:55,264
It's just bologna.

853
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:57,461
My bologna has a first name.

854
00:52:57,705 --> 00:53:00,503
Actually, your bologna has
about 30 names...

855
00:53:00,745 --> 00:53:04,135
...because they take odd parts
from all different ones.

856
00:53:04,385 --> 00:53:08,173
The leftovers: the hooves,
stomach lining, ears...

857
00:53:08,425 --> 00:53:13,215
...and stuff. They put it into
a machine and grind it up.

858
00:53:14,465 --> 00:53:18,902
Then out comes, like, this sheet.
That's what you're eating now.

859
00:53:22,265 --> 00:53:23,220
You know what?

860
00:53:23,465 --> 00:53:26,298
I don't eat bologna no more.
How about a pickle?

861
00:53:26,705 --> 00:53:30,857
-Can I eat the pickle?
-It has salt, but it's a vegetable.

862
00:53:31,105 --> 00:53:32,299
Salt in the pickle?

863
00:53:32,545 --> 00:53:37,096
Let me rinse-- Let me rinse it off.
There we go.

864
00:53:39,145 --> 00:53:40,624
How's that?

865
00:53:40,945 --> 00:53:43,061
Just.... Let's keep going.

866
00:53:43,305 --> 00:53:44,704
I don't taste salt now.

867
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:49,614
Go back.

868
00:53:56,225 --> 00:53:57,260
That's the guy.

869
00:53:57,545 --> 00:53:59,456
He was there, in the room.

870
00:53:59,705 --> 00:54:03,857
We got a tip they was running
major druggage, like 50 keys.

871
00:54:04,105 --> 00:54:05,743
So we steps to the door.

872
00:54:05,985 --> 00:54:08,658
"Freeze! Miami P.D.!
Get down, get down, get down!"

873
00:54:09,145 --> 00:54:13,377
Out of nowhere, this pimp named Chino
punched me in the head.

874
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:16,185
Chino's running ho's.
Your dad will explain that.

875
00:54:16,425 --> 00:54:17,301
Look at it.

876
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:21,538
Your dogs shit all over my place.
Liquid shit.

877
00:54:21,785 --> 00:54:25,619
It doesn't help, shellacking it in
with furniture polish.

878
00:54:25,865 --> 00:54:27,821
There's a piece there.
Get it.

879
00:54:28,065 --> 00:54:30,295
-I got it.
-Look like a chip of shit.

880
00:54:32,785 --> 00:54:35,424
Can I please have the parole jacket
on Noah Trafficante?

881
00:54:35,665 --> 00:54:37,257
-Thank you.
-You know what?

882
00:54:37,505 --> 00:54:39,257
I'm tired of this witness.

883
00:54:39,705 --> 00:54:42,094
I want my life the way it was.

884
00:54:42,345 --> 00:54:45,382
I'm tired.
I got married so I could stop lying.

885
00:54:45,625 --> 00:54:47,536
I can't believe you're complaining.

886
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:51,334
You've got it easy compared to me,
living in that zoo.

887
00:54:52,145 --> 00:54:53,737
Why you call my place a zoo?!

888
00:54:53,985 --> 00:54:56,260
-I'm tired of you.
-You want to fight?

889
00:54:56,505 --> 00:54:58,700
Listen, Francine, please....

890
00:55:01,345 --> 00:55:03,461
That's my silk shirt, man!

891
00:55:04,345 --> 00:55:05,698
It's nice.

892
00:55:05,945 --> 00:55:09,574
I figure since I'm gonna be Mike,
I might as well dress like Mike.

893
00:55:10,425 --> 00:55:11,221
I want to be...

894
00:55:11,465 --> 00:55:13,820
...I want to be like Mike.

895
00:55:15,225 --> 00:55:17,580
You're sick.
Something's wrong with you.

896
00:55:17,825 --> 00:55:20,623
You have a problem
that should be checked.

897
00:55:20,865 --> 00:55:21,900
Probably.

898
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:25,698
-The file. He worked at Club Hell.
-Thank you.

899
00:55:26,145 --> 00:55:29,262
Can you take care of this?
I gotta call the wife.

900
00:55:30,385 --> 00:55:31,215
Whose wife?!

901
00:55:31,465 --> 00:55:33,262
Can you please do some work?

902
00:55:33,505 --> 00:55:35,780
-Once today, just do something!
-I tell you--

903
00:55:36,025 --> 00:55:37,743
Do something to help this case.

904
00:55:37,985 --> 00:55:38,974
Boy!

905
00:55:39,225 --> 00:55:41,056
You look handsome today.

906
00:55:41,305 --> 00:55:45,457
No, see, it's not that kind of day.
Leave me alone.

907
00:55:45,705 --> 00:55:46,694
Seriously.

908
00:55:47,465 --> 00:55:48,614
What's up, babe, PMS?

909
00:55:48,865 --> 00:55:50,184
Damn the jokes!

910
00:55:50,425 --> 00:55:53,462
-Damn them! Ring it.
-Okay, I won't say anything.

911
00:55:53,705 --> 00:55:56,139
That's cool. Hold on.

912
00:55:58,145 --> 00:55:59,021
Go ahead.

913
00:56:01,905 --> 00:56:03,099
All right.

914
00:56:03,825 --> 00:56:05,099
How are the kids?

915
00:56:07,825 --> 00:56:09,497
How's potty training going?

916
00:56:11,865 --> 00:56:12,775
You're so silly.

917
00:56:12,985 --> 00:56:14,020
Will you be late?

918
00:56:14,265 --> 00:56:17,098
No, it'll be 10:30, 11:00
before I get in.

919
00:56:17,865 --> 00:56:20,299
Don't wait up. I'll be there.

920
00:56:24,785 --> 00:56:26,184
Rent a movie.

921
00:56:26,425 --> 00:56:28,620
Something we can kick back to.

922
00:56:31,265 --> 00:56:32,061
What're you wearing?

923
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:34,580
Give me the phone! Give it!

924
00:56:34,825 --> 00:56:38,943
She hung up a long time ago.
I was playing. I was playing.

925
00:56:40,745 --> 00:56:41,575
I was playing.

926
00:56:43,345 --> 00:56:46,462
Don't play like that.
That's my family. My happy home.

927
00:56:46,705 --> 00:56:48,138
Stop wearing my clothes.

928
00:56:51,585 --> 00:56:54,497
Everybody about the
motherfucking jokes today!

929
00:56:56,105 --> 00:56:57,458
I can't believe this.

930
00:56:57,705 --> 00:57:00,856
Come on, Eddie Dominguez's file
can't be that hard to get into.

931
00:57:01,105 --> 00:57:05,223
I tried 3 times, I just can't get in.
Besides, this is illegal.

932
00:57:05,825 --> 00:57:09,898
That never stopped you before.
Just let me know if you get anything.

933
00:57:10,185 --> 00:57:13,416
Anything for you.
But I can't get in. I tried.

934
00:57:25,945 --> 00:57:28,254
-What's up, Chet?
-Hey, Mr. Lowrey.

935
00:57:28,905 --> 00:57:30,304
Hey, Mr. Lowrey.

936
00:57:32,705 --> 00:57:34,184
The Lowrey Brothers.

937
00:57:34,945 --> 00:57:38,062
Let's just get down to Club Hell
and pick up Noah.

938
00:57:38,825 --> 00:57:40,338
Julie, it's me!

939
00:57:41,545 --> 00:57:44,013
You're supposed to get us
the Dominguez file.

940
00:57:44,265 --> 00:57:46,301
It'll take a day or two.

941
00:57:46,585 --> 00:57:49,861
-We don't have a day or two.
-I'm not a computer whiz.

942
00:57:50,105 --> 00:57:51,823
It'll take awhile.

943
00:57:52,105 --> 00:57:55,381
-You ain't taking care of shit.
-I was thinking--

944
00:57:56,625 --> 00:57:57,580
Hi.

945
00:57:58,905 --> 00:58:01,021
-You must be Marcus.
-I'd be Marcus.

946
00:58:01,585 --> 00:58:03,576
-That's right.
-Marcus, right?

947
00:58:03,825 --> 00:58:05,383
I'm Julie.

948
00:58:05,625 --> 00:58:07,183
Julie, hi.

949
00:58:07,425 --> 00:58:08,619
Nice to meet you.

950
00:58:08,865 --> 00:58:11,174
You too.
I recognized you from...

951
00:58:11,385 --> 00:58:12,977
...every one of the photographs.

952
00:58:13,185 --> 00:58:15,745
Well, it's my man, you know.

953
00:58:17,905 --> 00:58:20,339
The wall.
Yeah, those on the wall.

954
00:58:20,785 --> 00:58:22,776
You must be very good.

955
00:58:23,025 --> 00:58:24,299
I'm sorry?

956
00:58:24,985 --> 00:58:28,580
As a partner.
Given your job, what you do.

957
00:58:28,825 --> 00:58:31,498
What time are we
doing this thing tonight?

958
00:58:31,745 --> 00:58:34,054
Mike said we're going to a club.

959
00:58:36,345 --> 00:58:37,937
"We"...

960
00:58:38,185 --> 00:58:39,777
...as in me and my partner.

961
00:58:39,985 --> 00:58:42,977
You wanted protective custody.
You at my house.

962
00:58:43,185 --> 00:58:44,664
That's just great.

963
00:58:44,865 --> 00:58:49,495
I'll stay here with Chet
the mini-moron doorman to protect me?

964
00:58:49,705 --> 00:58:51,218
Chet is very good.

965
00:58:52,745 --> 00:58:55,942
That looks like a stain on your rug.
Damn.

966
00:58:56,185 --> 00:59:00,178
That was my baby, Luke.
He gets nervous and--

967
00:59:00,665 --> 00:59:01,700
He just shits.

968
00:59:01,945 --> 00:59:05,858
It's like marking his territory.
Sort of a male thing.

969
00:59:06,065 --> 00:59:09,102
I offered to pay Mike for the cleaning
and he refused.

970
00:59:09,345 --> 00:59:10,460
I'll get rid of it.

971
00:59:10,665 --> 00:59:11,734
You don't need that.

972
00:59:11,945 --> 00:59:14,903
I was going to throw it out.
I want a new look.

973
00:59:15,105 --> 00:59:17,744
Mike, he's a special guy.
Mike is special.

974
00:59:17,985 --> 00:59:20,055
I call him Special Mike.

975
00:59:20,665 --> 00:59:23,896
It's funny, you can laugh at that.
That's why...

976
00:59:24,505 --> 00:59:25,620
...I love him.

977
00:59:26,585 --> 00:59:28,655
Me, I'd be pissed.

978
00:59:30,185 --> 00:59:32,653
Look at this cute dog on the couch.

979
00:59:32,905 --> 00:59:33,781
That's Luke.

980
00:59:34,025 --> 00:59:36,334
Look how he crawls on the leather.

981
00:59:36,585 --> 00:59:39,816
You want to meet Duke?
He's in the bed. He's upset...

982
00:59:40,065 --> 00:59:43,341
...and having diarrhea and throwing up.

983
00:59:43,585 --> 00:59:44,938
Oh, baby.

984
00:59:45,185 --> 00:59:48,143
Let's go see
if Duke is going to be okay.

985
00:59:53,825 --> 00:59:55,975
Me and you. Me and you.

986
00:59:59,585 --> 01:00:00,734
Who are you?

987
01:00:00,945 --> 01:00:03,505
-Who are you?
-Look, you must get out.

988
01:00:03,745 --> 01:00:05,861
-Hands off!
-Don't push me!

989
01:00:06,065 --> 01:00:07,134
I'm Yvette.

990
01:00:07,345 --> 01:00:08,778
Get your hands off me!

991
01:00:09,025 --> 01:00:10,583
What're you doing?

992
01:00:10,785 --> 01:00:14,744
Get out. If you don't stop
stalking me, I'll arrest you.

993
01:00:15,265 --> 01:00:16,937
You old psycho!

994
01:00:17,185 --> 01:00:19,540
-You asshole!
-She's into some weird shit.

995
01:00:20,385 --> 01:00:21,977
What's going on?

996
01:00:23,985 --> 01:00:25,543
That was crazy Yvette.

997
01:00:25,785 --> 01:00:27,377
Stalking me.

998
01:00:29,425 --> 01:00:31,859
I forgot she was coming.
You threw her out?

999
01:00:37,145 --> 01:00:39,261
Yvette is a masseuse.

1000
01:00:43,305 --> 01:00:44,977
She massages shit.

1001
01:00:45,905 --> 01:00:47,304
She told me.

1002
01:00:47,665 --> 01:00:50,179
Are there any other
totally hysterical...

1003
01:00:50,385 --> 01:00:53,980
...half-naked women popping by
I should know about?

1004
01:00:54,545 --> 01:00:55,500
She was naked?

1005
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:57,100
Titties were out.

1006
01:00:57,305 --> 01:00:58,533
You threw her out naked?

1007
01:01:01,145 --> 01:01:04,694
My wife would hate--
She hates womanizers.

1008
01:01:07,465 --> 01:01:09,137
Something's wrong with you.

1009
01:01:09,385 --> 01:01:11,979
You don't respect
other people's shit.

1010
01:01:12,185 --> 01:01:14,415
I've been telling you that for years.

1011
01:01:14,785 --> 01:01:16,104
Your trash is all over.

1012
01:01:16,345 --> 01:01:17,903
Enough! Please!

1013
01:01:18,705 --> 01:01:20,377
Me and my partner...

1014
01:01:20,625 --> 01:01:23,537
...we're going to Club Hell
to bust Noah.

1015
01:01:23,745 --> 01:01:25,736
Anyone have a problem with that?

1016
01:01:26,265 --> 01:01:27,175
Fine.

1017
01:01:29,145 --> 01:01:30,783
Don't blow the case.

1018
01:01:40,105 --> 01:01:42,175
Here's the deal: You stay put.

1019
01:01:42,385 --> 01:01:46,344
Anyone tells you to move,
you're making a delivery for Fouchet.

1020
01:01:46,585 --> 01:01:49,338
You got it? You got it? Frank?

1021
01:01:49,585 --> 01:01:52,622
It's ether! It'll explode, you dope!

1022
01:01:53,905 --> 01:01:56,260
Don't even breathe, you knucklehead!

1023
01:02:10,225 --> 01:02:11,897
I remember you.

1024
01:02:30,265 --> 01:02:31,664
Check it, Lowrey...

1025
01:02:32,025 --> 01:02:34,698
...we got 2 days left.
Let's do this right.

1026
01:02:34,905 --> 01:02:37,214
No gunshots, no dead bodies.

1027
01:02:37,425 --> 01:02:39,177
I'm not trying to lose my job.

1028
01:02:39,425 --> 01:02:42,622
As I recall, the last dead bad guys
belonged to you.

1029
01:02:43,265 --> 01:02:44,983
Next time you kill them...

1030
01:02:45,225 --> 01:02:49,104
...do it after you get the information.
Just a suggestion.

1031
01:02:49,345 --> 01:02:52,860
Please. You ain't even
comparing body counts.

1032
01:02:53,785 --> 01:02:55,741
Should I keep going?

1033
01:02:55,985 --> 01:02:57,020
I'm out.

1034
01:02:57,665 --> 01:03:00,338
Noah's parole jacket
says he works here.

1035
01:03:00,585 --> 01:03:03,497
We're here arguing
like schoolgirls.

1036
01:03:03,745 --> 01:03:05,656
Let's stop this bickering.

1037
01:03:06,745 --> 01:03:09,213
Because you're getting on my nerves.

1038
01:03:13,025 --> 01:03:15,255
He got no package.

1039
01:03:32,825 --> 01:03:36,135
Look at you! Look at you!
Can you stay focused?

1040
01:03:36,385 --> 01:03:37,454
I'm focused.

1041
01:03:38,065 --> 01:03:40,454
Focused on all this ass around here.

1042
01:03:40,665 --> 01:03:42,860
Let's do what we came to do and go.

1043
01:03:43,105 --> 01:03:44,174
-Simple.
-Fine.

1044
01:03:44,425 --> 01:03:47,064
Check around. Meet at the bar
in 10 minutes.

1045
01:03:47,305 --> 01:03:49,023
-Fine.
-Fine.

1046
01:03:53,465 --> 01:03:55,854
Holy shit, what is he doing?

1047
01:03:56,225 --> 01:03:57,135
Oh, man!

1048
01:03:57,385 --> 01:03:59,501
That's the cop! There he is!

1049
01:03:59,745 --> 01:04:01,895
That's him! I'm going.

1050
01:04:10,905 --> 01:04:11,974
What's up?

1051
01:04:13,985 --> 01:04:17,057
Budweiser. Feel like I had
a million of them.

1052
01:04:28,985 --> 01:04:30,259
What's up?

1053
01:04:44,345 --> 01:04:46,097
Tell me where to throw him!

1054
01:05:20,105 --> 01:05:21,458
Fuck!

1055
01:05:30,985 --> 01:05:34,500
Learn how to work the safety
with your punk-ass.

1056
01:05:34,985 --> 01:05:35,974
I'll be back.

1057
01:05:44,185 --> 01:05:45,857
Who whupped your ass now?.

1058
01:05:46,465 --> 01:05:48,979
This really ain't the fucking time.

1059
01:05:49,225 --> 01:05:51,659
They know.
Let's get Noah and go.

1060
01:06:06,905 --> 01:06:07,701
It's the chick.

1061
01:06:08,105 --> 01:06:09,220
Look, the chick!

1062
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:11,615
The bitch from the rooftop!

1063
01:06:52,665 --> 01:06:53,461
Let's go!

1064
01:06:53,705 --> 01:06:54,905
That was the guy who shot Max!

1065
01:06:54,905 --> 01:06:55,894
That was the guy who shot Max!

1066
01:07:01,505 --> 01:07:02,779
The truck!

1067
01:07:03,025 --> 01:07:04,140
Take the truck!

1068
01:07:04,345 --> 01:07:05,494
There! Go!

1069
01:07:07,665 --> 01:07:09,223
We're in a hurry.

1070
01:07:11,305 --> 01:07:12,101
Let's go!

1071
01:07:12,345 --> 01:07:15,576
You're cops! Why are we running away?!
He's in there!

1072
01:07:15,785 --> 01:07:16,854
Here! Go!

1073
01:07:26,865 --> 01:07:27,854
This is good.

1074
01:07:28,105 --> 01:07:29,424
Noah's chasing us!

1075
01:07:30,105 --> 01:07:31,424
What was that?

1076
01:07:32,385 --> 01:07:33,579
What was that?

1077
01:07:33,825 --> 01:07:35,941
That was-- I don't know.

1078
01:07:36,345 --> 01:07:39,940
I had a perfect shot at him
if Action Jackson here--

1079
01:07:41,625 --> 01:07:44,219
No! This is official police business!

1080
01:07:44,425 --> 01:07:47,974
You had no business in there!
Can you drive?

1081
01:07:48,225 --> 01:07:50,898
-Please drive!
-Don't bring it here!

1082
01:07:51,145 --> 01:07:53,295
You picked an ice cream truck!

1083
01:07:55,145 --> 01:07:57,101
-What am I smelling?
-Drive!

1084
01:07:57,345 --> 01:07:58,539
What am I smelling?

1085
01:07:58,745 --> 01:07:59,655
Ether.

1086
01:07:59,905 --> 01:08:02,021
Extremely flammable ether.

1087
01:08:02,345 --> 01:08:03,221
Oh, shit.

1088
01:08:03,465 --> 01:08:04,659
Goddamn.

1089
01:08:04,905 --> 01:08:06,179
You the man!

1090
01:08:06,385 --> 01:08:07,613
You the man tonight!

1091
01:08:07,825 --> 01:08:10,737
How you pick an ice-cream truck
that's a bomb?!

1092
01:08:15,625 --> 01:08:16,740
Shit!

1093
01:08:16,945 --> 01:08:18,697
This is protective custody?!

1094
01:08:18,945 --> 01:08:19,934
Yes!

1095
01:08:26,825 --> 01:08:27,655
Shit!

1096
01:08:42,985 --> 01:08:45,101
Do something!
We're out of road!

1097
01:08:45,305 --> 01:08:46,943
Who picked this road?!

1098
01:08:47,145 --> 01:08:49,579
All the road in Miami
and you run out!

1099
01:08:49,825 --> 01:08:51,577
Come up with an idea, fast!

1100
01:08:51,785 --> 01:08:53,935
Why must I come up with the ideas?!

1101
01:09:06,425 --> 01:09:07,574
Take this shit!

1102
01:09:07,825 --> 01:09:10,100
Dead end!
There's no more road!

1103
01:09:18,745 --> 01:09:20,542
We out of fucking road!

1104
01:09:23,625 --> 01:09:24,853
It's going to blow!

1105
01:09:26,025 --> 01:09:27,458
Get the fuck out!

1106
01:09:41,585 --> 01:09:42,574
Well....

1107
01:09:43,305 --> 01:09:45,773
Should I add this to your body count?

1108
01:09:48,185 --> 01:09:50,653
There goes our only lead to the dope.

1109
01:09:51,145 --> 01:09:52,897
Ain't this a bitch!

1110
01:09:53,905 --> 01:09:55,338
The dope?!

1111
01:09:56,785 --> 01:09:58,821
What are you talking about?

1112
01:09:59,065 --> 01:10:03,104
"There goes our only lead to Max's
killer?!" He's out there!

1113
01:10:03,345 --> 01:10:08,214
That's not important, it's not
your job to protect people! Shit!

1114
01:10:08,425 --> 01:10:10,700
-She's crazy!
-I'm crazy?!

1115
01:10:14,945 --> 01:10:16,378
Her rocker's gone!

1116
01:10:16,625 --> 01:10:19,344
Stop your barking!
This is the witness!

1117
01:10:19,545 --> 01:10:22,105
She done zoomed.
You deal with her.

1118
01:10:22,705 --> 01:10:23,774
No way.

1119
01:10:24,025 --> 01:10:26,141
Listen, yes, okay, you're right.

1120
01:10:26,345 --> 01:10:30,623
This started because of missing drugs.
But let me tell you:

1121
01:10:30,825 --> 01:10:34,022
There's nothing more
important to Mike...

1122
01:10:34,225 --> 01:10:36,534
...than doing this guy that killed Max.

1123
01:10:37,305 --> 01:10:41,423
Sometimes he has a hard time
expressing his real feelings.

1124
01:10:43,825 --> 01:10:46,259
Come on.
It'll be all right.

1125
01:10:46,785 --> 01:10:47,979
We need you.

1126
01:10:48,785 --> 01:10:50,059
Part of the team.

1127
01:10:50,785 --> 01:10:53,857
I thought he was supposed to be
the smooth one.

1128
01:10:55,185 --> 01:10:57,141
This has not been a good day.

1129
01:10:57,345 --> 01:11:01,258
Damn right. It's bullshit.
We got 2 days to find these fools...

1130
01:11:01,505 --> 01:11:04,577
...and no leads because
you cooked Noah's ass.

1131
01:11:08,465 --> 01:11:09,341
Shampoo?

1132
01:11:09,665 --> 01:11:10,654
Hello.

1133
01:11:15,905 --> 01:11:17,054
What's up?

1134
01:11:21,625 --> 01:11:24,093
It don't take that long
to get shampoo.

1135
01:11:24,345 --> 01:11:26,176
-Let's go.
-Look at this.

1136
01:11:26,385 --> 01:11:28,023
Animal tested. Animal tested.

1137
01:11:28,225 --> 01:11:30,693
You know how many chemicals
are in this?

1138
01:11:30,905 --> 01:11:33,783
I don't care if you go bald.
Let's go.

1139
01:11:33,985 --> 01:11:34,815
Jojo.

1140
01:11:36,145 --> 01:11:37,294
He's a chemist.

1141
01:11:37,505 --> 01:11:40,736
Too much heroin and ether
for nobody to know nothing.

1142
01:11:40,985 --> 01:11:42,464
What's he talking about?

1143
01:11:42,705 --> 01:11:45,742
You know the barrels of ether that
blew up on the truck?

1144
01:11:45,945 --> 01:11:47,901
It's used to process heroin.

1145
01:11:48,105 --> 01:11:50,665
They do that to cut it.
It quadruples the value.

1146
01:11:50,865 --> 01:11:53,379
You can't stick it in the microwave.

1147
01:11:54,185 --> 01:11:55,504
Let's pay for this.

1148
01:11:59,345 --> 01:12:00,255
How much?

1149
01:12:00,465 --> 01:12:01,739
$1 4.25.

1150
01:12:01,985 --> 01:12:04,101
I left my wallet somewhere.

1151
01:12:04,345 --> 01:12:06,415
Freeze, motherbitches!

1152
01:12:07,825 --> 01:12:09,178
-Don't move.
-Wait.

1153
01:12:09,385 --> 01:12:10,534
I'm not understanding.

1154
01:12:11,905 --> 01:12:13,384
Do you attract violence?

1155
01:12:13,625 --> 01:12:15,536
Shut the fuck up!

1156
01:12:15,785 --> 01:12:16,740
Take it easy.

1157
01:12:16,985 --> 01:12:18,179
We are cops.

1158
01:12:18,425 --> 01:12:21,497
You're not cops. I'm not stupid.
I know.

1159
01:12:21,825 --> 01:12:23,304
-Wait.
-I've seen police.

1160
01:12:23,545 --> 01:12:25,501
I'm reaching for my badge.

1161
01:12:26,025 --> 01:12:27,981
You want badges, motherbitch?!

1162
01:12:28,185 --> 01:12:29,664
I give you badges!

1163
01:12:29,865 --> 01:12:32,220
Here! 99 cents.
I sell you some.

1164
01:12:32,425 --> 01:12:35,098
You got 8 badges.
This cop thing don't work.

1165
01:12:35,305 --> 01:12:36,704
I blow you!

1166
01:12:37,105 --> 01:12:38,094
Then I blow you!

1167
01:12:38,305 --> 01:12:40,978
Blow me? No, hump me,
that's all right.

1168
01:12:42,025 --> 01:12:44,380
I kill before. I kill again.

1169
01:12:44,585 --> 01:12:46,337
-Hold on!
-I'll blow you!

1170
01:12:46,545 --> 01:12:47,694
-Hump me.
-Hold on!

1171
01:12:47,905 --> 01:12:51,534
The emotion I'm going through
means this is serious.

1172
01:12:51,785 --> 01:12:55,221
Me and this motherfucker
is not vibing right now.

1173
01:12:55,425 --> 01:12:58,258
-Something on your chest?
-I got something.

1174
01:12:58,505 --> 01:13:00,496
Hello! The guy's got a cannon.

1175
01:13:00,705 --> 01:13:01,501
What do you want?

1176
01:13:01,705 --> 01:13:03,821
You want some?
Then come get it.

1177
01:13:04,025 --> 01:13:04,821
I'm gone!

1178
01:13:05,025 --> 01:13:05,855
Freeze, bitch!

1179
01:13:06,585 --> 01:13:07,654
You freeze, bitch!

1180
01:13:08,225 --> 01:13:10,864
Oh, shit. I'm fucked.

1181
01:13:11,065 --> 01:13:12,544
Now back up.

1182
01:13:12,785 --> 01:13:16,858
Put the gun down.
Get me a pack of Bubblicious.

1183
01:13:17,305 --> 01:13:19,057
And some Skittles.

1184
01:13:23,585 --> 01:13:25,815
Hell of a night.
I'm going to bed.

1185
01:13:26,505 --> 01:13:29,258
So make yourself at home.

1186
01:13:29,465 --> 01:13:30,261
It's your bed.

1187
01:13:31,385 --> 01:13:33,296
I'll sit down...

1188
01:13:33,585 --> 01:13:35,018
...for a minute.

1189
01:13:35,265 --> 01:13:39,463
Because I'm guarding shit.
I'm watching out for the bad boys.

1190
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:42,543
I can see things real well, you know...

1191
01:13:42,865 --> 01:13:44,344
...from my peripherals.

1192
01:13:44,585 --> 01:13:46,541
For such a stud, Mike Lowrey...

1193
01:13:46,745 --> 01:13:50,784
...you sure seem rigid about having
a girl in your bed.

1194
01:13:52,025 --> 01:13:52,980
Who?

1195
01:13:53,225 --> 01:13:55,580
Me? Mike Lowrey?
I'm not rigid.

1196
01:13:57,185 --> 01:13:58,413
Comfortable.

1197
01:13:58,625 --> 01:14:01,662
It's my bed.
Why would I be uncomfortable?

1198
01:14:02,065 --> 01:14:05,296
I don't know. l think it's more
than just wired.

1199
01:14:05,545 --> 01:14:08,139
Maybe it was all the guns and stuff.

1200
01:14:08,385 --> 01:14:10,535
I never really shot a gun before.

1201
01:14:10,785 --> 01:14:12,741
All that steel....

1202
01:14:13,865 --> 01:14:16,743
Don't you feel a little funny?

1203
01:14:18,025 --> 01:14:19,583
I'm not a comedian, but....

1204
01:14:20,345 --> 01:14:23,417
I don't mean that kind of funny,
I mean, like...

1205
01:14:23,705 --> 01:14:24,774
...funny.

1206
01:14:33,305 --> 01:14:34,784
You don't want that.

1207
01:14:35,065 --> 01:14:35,941
You don't want that,
because when I come...

1208
01:14:38,145 --> 01:14:39,624
...I come with thunder.

1209
01:14:39,865 --> 01:14:41,139
And that's....

1210
01:14:41,345 --> 01:14:44,655
You sound like you're saving yourself
for marriage.

1211
01:14:46,425 --> 01:14:48,655
No, that ain't me there.

1212
01:14:49,465 --> 01:14:50,659
That's Marcus.

1213
01:14:50,905 --> 01:14:52,861
You know what I'm saying?
He's the man.

1214
01:14:53,745 --> 01:14:55,064
I got some others--

1215
01:14:55,585 --> 01:14:58,543
I done seen it now.
Turn the page.

1216
01:14:58,865 --> 01:15:01,379
Turn the page.
I done already seen it.

1217
01:15:02,825 --> 01:15:03,735
Don't laugh.

1218
01:15:04,585 --> 01:15:07,304
I cannot believe he wore
his Afro that big.

1219
01:15:07,505 --> 01:15:10,303
-I forgot about that.
-He looked cute like that.

1220
01:15:10,985 --> 01:15:12,816
What's Marcus' wife like?

1221
01:15:16,945 --> 01:15:18,424
She's like a wife.

1222
01:15:18,985 --> 01:15:23,376
I mean, she must be pretty amazing
to keep a guy like Marcus.

1223
01:15:27,025 --> 01:15:28,583
Keep a guy like what?

1224
01:15:28,945 --> 01:15:32,096
You know, watching him tonight,
he's very...

1225
01:15:32,665 --> 01:15:33,939
...sort of take charge.

1226
01:15:34,145 --> 01:15:37,421
The way he was throwing guys
this way and that.

1227
01:15:37,665 --> 01:15:42,136
There's something about him.
I don't know what. He's so smooth.

1228
01:15:42,345 --> 01:15:43,380
Boy...

1229
01:15:43,945 --> 01:15:45,094
...I bet...

1230
01:15:45,345 --> 01:15:49,463
...his wife's enjoying the smoothness
right this minute.

1231
01:15:51,385 --> 01:15:54,263
He got a quality that women respond to.

1232
01:15:55,225 --> 01:15:59,184
I can't imagine the kind of woman
that wouldn't find Marcus...

1233
01:15:59,425 --> 01:16:00,983
...attractive.

1234
01:16:01,225 --> 01:16:03,898
Probably couldn't be around him...

1235
01:16:04,345 --> 01:16:06,540
...just like our situation.

1236
01:16:06,745 --> 01:16:10,215
-If two people were alone--
-Not with a guy like that.

1237
01:16:10,425 --> 01:16:11,414
Excuse me.

1238
01:16:15,745 --> 01:16:17,178
What is wrong with him?

1239
01:16:17,385 --> 01:16:20,218
This one goes on
the bulletin board at work.

1240
01:16:20,425 --> 01:16:22,541
Don't do that, no, come on.

1241
01:16:22,745 --> 01:16:25,305
Put it back in. I can't believe you
took it out.

1242
01:16:25,505 --> 01:16:28,258
Marcus'll kill us if he finds out.
Give it to me.

1243
01:16:28,465 --> 01:16:30,421
I can't believe I let you see it.

1244
01:16:30,625 --> 01:16:31,740
Motherfucker!

1245
01:16:38,825 --> 01:16:39,974
Goddamn it.

1246
01:16:40,185 --> 01:16:41,982
Got some jewelry for you.

1247
01:16:42,185 --> 01:16:44,141
I'm sorry, but damn that.

1248
01:16:44,345 --> 01:16:49,214
We need to address the serious
lack of trust in this relationship.

1249
01:16:49,465 --> 01:16:50,215
Please.

1250
01:16:50,425 --> 01:16:52,381
Is this legal?
I don't think it's legal.

1251
01:16:52,585 --> 01:16:53,620
I won't be long.

1252
01:16:54,145 --> 01:16:55,544
It's legal.

1253
01:16:55,825 --> 01:16:57,099
Out of sight.

1254
01:16:58,745 --> 01:17:01,703
Sanchez, Lowrey.
Yeah, your mother. Listen.

1255
01:17:01,905 --> 01:17:03,975
These guys
are about to make a move.

1256
01:17:04,185 --> 01:17:07,222
Blue convertible. Two occupants.
Check it out.

1257
01:17:13,185 --> 01:17:14,334
Here we go.

1258
01:17:14,545 --> 01:17:15,455
Is that our guy?

1259
01:17:15,705 --> 01:17:16,854
Where's the girl?

1260
01:17:17,865 --> 01:17:19,378
I don't see any girl.

1261
01:17:25,145 --> 01:17:27,898
Fuck off, barking-ass dog.
Shut up!

1262
01:17:30,465 --> 01:17:32,296
Sneak up on my own house.

1263
01:17:33,825 --> 01:17:35,224
What in the world?

1264
01:17:35,425 --> 01:17:36,460
Very strange.

1265
01:17:36,665 --> 01:17:39,782
His ass is upstairs.
Supposed to be my boy!

1266
01:17:39,985 --> 01:17:41,134
You motherfucker!

1267
01:17:41,545 --> 01:17:43,456
Ducking and weaving,
up and down.

1268
01:17:43,705 --> 01:17:45,935
Look at this shit.
This is what you want?

1269
01:17:46,185 --> 01:17:48,540
Got me climbing like a fucking chimp.

1270
01:17:48,785 --> 01:17:51,094
No, I ain't going out like that.

1271
01:17:51,305 --> 01:17:53,819
Don't take nobody that long
to get in bed.

1272
01:17:55,225 --> 01:17:57,420
Got my babies in the house.

1273
01:17:58,305 --> 01:18:00,500
The man can't get no quality time...

1274
01:18:00,745 --> 01:18:02,895
...but my partner gets
quality time.

1275
01:18:03,105 --> 01:18:04,094
I don't play that shit.

1276
01:18:12,225 --> 01:18:13,419
Somebody's out there!

1277
01:18:13,625 --> 01:18:15,217
Get the kids. Get the kids!

1278
01:18:17,305 --> 01:18:19,944
I knew it! I didn't
need a psychic.

1279
01:18:20,265 --> 01:18:21,254
Freeze!

1280
01:18:26,345 --> 01:18:27,778
Move, and you're dead.

1281
01:18:29,145 --> 01:18:32,137
They're going to shoot each other.
This is unbelievable.

1282
01:18:32,385 --> 01:18:33,534
Miami Police!
Freeze!

1283
01:18:33,785 --> 01:18:35,264
I am the police!

1284
01:18:35,545 --> 01:18:36,978
What are you doing?

1285
01:18:37,185 --> 01:18:39,062
-You're doing Theresa!
-No, I'm not!

1286
01:18:39,265 --> 01:18:40,618
-You're doing my baby!
-Shut up!

1287
01:18:43,065 --> 01:18:45,659
We could sneak up and
snuff them both right now.

1288
01:18:45,865 --> 01:18:47,218
But we want the girl.

1289
01:18:47,745 --> 01:18:50,498
Never fuck with
a cop's family, asshole.

1290
01:18:50,745 --> 01:18:52,463
-Doesn't that piss you off?.
-Yeah.

1291
01:18:52,705 --> 01:18:55,173
Don't get me started.
Out of the car.

1292
01:18:56,185 --> 01:18:57,379
Motherfucker!

1293
01:18:57,625 --> 01:18:59,422
Shit is making you crazy!

1294
01:18:59,785 --> 01:19:02,424
You know it ain't going on between
me and Theresa!

1295
01:19:05,865 --> 01:19:08,618
I've been your partner for six years...

1296
01:19:08,865 --> 01:19:10,617
...and your boy all my life.

1297
01:19:10,865 --> 01:19:12,423
For you to even think...!

1298
01:19:12,665 --> 01:19:15,657
To let dumb shit
like that get in your mind!

1299
01:19:15,865 --> 01:19:17,617
This is me!
What's your problem?

1300
01:19:20,305 --> 01:19:21,294
Fucking....

1301
01:19:22,625 --> 01:19:23,774
I'm just....

1302
01:19:28,265 --> 01:19:29,778
I'm fine!

1303
01:19:30,585 --> 01:19:32,462
Get out of here!
Where's Julie?

1304
01:19:32,705 --> 01:19:34,935
She's in the car, handcuffed
to the steering wheel.

1305
01:19:35,185 --> 01:19:37,016
Are you trying to blow this case?

1306
01:19:37,225 --> 01:19:38,943
My bad.
I ain't had no quality time.

1307
01:19:39,145 --> 01:19:42,820
You know how it is.
Sometimes you do dumb shit.

1308
01:19:47,025 --> 01:19:47,821
My bad.

1309
01:19:48,585 --> 01:19:49,574
It's cool.

1310
01:19:49,905 --> 01:19:51,941
Go, go. All right.

1311
01:19:55,465 --> 01:19:58,696
These phone calls were made
to Club Hell from this precinct.

1312
01:19:58,945 --> 01:20:00,503
Explain.

1313
01:20:00,785 --> 01:20:04,414
I'll ask you once more.
Give me a goddamn name!

1314
01:20:08,585 --> 01:20:10,974
-All I know is his name.
-Give it to me.

1315
01:20:11,265 --> 01:20:12,744
You're looking at
a lot of time.

1316
01:20:14,305 --> 01:20:15,863
Fouchet.

1317
01:20:16,105 --> 01:20:17,299
Fouchet, I think.

1318
01:20:17,545 --> 01:20:19,263
That's his whole name?

1319
01:20:20,585 --> 01:20:22,177
I'm just an errand boy.

1320
01:20:22,505 --> 01:20:24,177
Stop. You'll make me cry.

1321
01:20:24,425 --> 01:20:26,985
I swear. Watching the house
was my first gig.

1322
01:20:27,225 --> 01:20:29,420
How sweet.
Does that make you union?

1323
01:20:30,225 --> 01:20:31,817
If you were a real cop...

1324
01:20:32,025 --> 01:20:34,016
...in the field, working every day...

1325
01:20:34,225 --> 01:20:35,943
...you'd realize shit happens.

1326
01:20:36,385 --> 01:20:37,613
Don't give me that!

1327
01:20:37,825 --> 01:20:39,702
You're on your way
to reassignment.

1328
01:20:39,945 --> 01:20:42,140
Who'll reassign me?
You?

1329
01:20:42,345 --> 01:20:45,143
Until you have the authority
to reassign me...

1330
01:20:45,345 --> 01:20:46,858
...stay the hell out of here.

1331
01:20:47,705 --> 01:20:50,265
They should bone
and get it over with.

1332
01:20:50,785 --> 01:20:53,140
I'm getting really tired of this.

1333
01:20:53,345 --> 01:20:54,937
You're tired?

1334
01:20:57,265 --> 01:21:00,894
They're overfed, lazy.
We need video surveillance.

1335
01:21:01,105 --> 01:21:02,504
The guard dogs are nothing.

1336
01:21:03,945 --> 01:21:05,697
Don't make this hard!

1337
01:21:09,505 --> 01:21:11,382
Nice running into you, Jojo.

1338
01:21:11,625 --> 01:21:14,219
Always making it
hard on yourself, Jojo.

1339
01:21:14,465 --> 01:21:17,502
Gee, Julie,
what have you been up to?

1340
01:21:17,705 --> 01:21:20,424
Just hanging out,
handcuffed to steering wheels.

1341
01:21:20,785 --> 01:21:23,697
We're looking for someone
to step on some heroin.

1342
01:21:23,945 --> 01:21:26,379
Do it fast and well.
A real pro.

1343
01:21:26,625 --> 01:21:29,537
I told you, I'm
in the rubber business now.

1344
01:21:29,785 --> 01:21:32,094
Jojo, we're not playing, man.

1345
01:21:33,225 --> 01:21:35,102
I'm telling you, I'm straight.

1346
01:21:35,385 --> 01:21:37,296
I'm straight like a board.

1347
01:21:37,545 --> 01:21:39,103
I'm so straight, it's sick.

1348
01:21:39,345 --> 01:21:42,576
It's a lot of dope.
Who could cut it real quick?

1349
01:21:43,425 --> 01:21:45,700
Cut it?
You mean, cut it up?

1350
01:21:46,265 --> 01:21:48,221
I'm sick of this bullshit.

1351
01:21:49,545 --> 01:21:50,898
Bullshit!

1352
01:21:52,345 --> 01:21:52,982
What's up?

1353
01:21:53,225 --> 01:21:54,863
You're pulling a gun on me?

1354
01:21:55,105 --> 01:21:58,256
You're cops! I should
turn you in to Hard Copy.

1355
01:21:58,505 --> 01:21:59,858
Put your ass on TV.

1356
01:22:00,105 --> 01:22:00,981
I got this.

1357
01:22:03,225 --> 01:22:04,658
I got 15 bullets.

1358
01:22:05,625 --> 01:22:09,743
If you don't start talking,
I'll fill you with hot shit.

1359
01:22:09,985 --> 01:22:11,737
He's a former ganja-smoking fucker.

1360
01:22:11,945 --> 01:22:13,663
-He ain't worth it.
-You want some?

1361
01:22:13,865 --> 01:22:15,264
I'll bust your ass too!

1362
01:22:16,185 --> 01:22:17,504
So sad.

1363
01:22:17,785 --> 01:22:19,059
You're on your own.

1364
01:22:21,345 --> 01:22:22,095
What's up?

1365
01:22:22,345 --> 01:22:23,539
I'll tell you...

1366
01:22:23,785 --> 01:22:26,982
...you splatter his ass,
he's no good to us. Fuck that!

1367
01:22:27,465 --> 01:22:32,141
Fuck that! I'm not going down for you
killing Jojo the tire man!

1368
01:22:33,785 --> 01:22:38,142
I don't want no brain fragments
in my clothes! It stinks!

1369
01:22:39,065 --> 01:22:40,134
Fuck that!

1370
01:22:40,385 --> 01:22:43,934
I'll tell you what I know.
I don't know everything about everything.

1371
01:22:44,185 --> 01:22:45,857
Tell him something!

1372
01:22:46,105 --> 01:22:46,901
3 guys.

1373
01:22:47,105 --> 01:22:48,504
They got a laboratory.

1374
01:22:48,745 --> 01:22:49,700
No, no.

1375
01:22:49,905 --> 01:22:53,375
2 guys! One guy died in
a plane crash last year.

1376
01:22:53,945 --> 01:22:55,173
Used to be more!

1377
01:22:56,385 --> 01:22:59,502
No, it's one guy, really.
It's only one guy.

1378
01:23:00,065 --> 01:23:01,384
Don't fuck with me.

1379
01:23:01,625 --> 01:23:04,697
This guy's an Einstein,
genius college boy...

1380
01:23:04,945 --> 01:23:07,584
...egghead motherfucker.
He got glasses.

1381
01:23:07,825 --> 01:23:09,736
His rich parents
live in Coconut Grove.

1382
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:11,941
Where? Tell him again, Jojo!

1383
01:23:12,145 --> 01:23:13,373
I'll tell you where.

1384
01:23:14,905 --> 01:23:16,304
You'd do that?

1385
01:23:16,985 --> 01:23:21,695
I want to help. Stick that gun down.
I got the address...

1386
01:23:21,945 --> 01:23:23,060
...in the...

1387
01:23:24,025 --> 01:23:25,140
...office.

1388
01:23:26,905 --> 01:23:28,623
Thanks. Why don't you get it?

1389
01:23:28,865 --> 01:23:29,775
Cool.

1390
01:23:30,105 --> 01:23:31,174
-Go.
-Now?.

1391
01:23:31,425 --> 01:23:33,541
Now's good. Now is real good.

1392
01:23:33,785 --> 01:23:34,934
This is on me.

1393
01:23:35,185 --> 01:23:38,939
Why don't you pick out
some white walls? A gift from me to you.

1394
01:23:41,665 --> 01:23:44,498
You made me think
you were going to shoot me.

1395
01:23:44,705 --> 01:23:45,854
I was.

1396
01:23:48,825 --> 01:23:51,737
When's this punk-ass chemist
coming home?

1397
01:23:53,065 --> 01:23:54,703
This is a stakeout.

1398
01:23:54,945 --> 01:23:56,503
Not what I imagined.

1399
01:23:56,745 --> 01:23:59,305
Thought there'd be more conversation.

1400
01:23:59,705 --> 01:24:02,060
Sorry, it's not up to your...

1401
01:24:02,305 --> 01:24:03,863
...usual high standards.

1402
01:24:04,905 --> 01:24:06,736
Is he always like this on a stakeout?

1403
01:24:07,585 --> 01:24:10,497
What is it?
Too much caffeine?

1404
01:24:10,705 --> 01:24:12,184
Not enough sex?

1405
01:24:12,385 --> 01:24:14,421
I can't believe she went there.

1406
01:24:15,345 --> 01:24:17,222
You don't know who
you talking to?

1407
01:24:17,465 --> 01:24:19,615
That's Mike Lowrey over there.

1408
01:24:20,705 --> 01:24:22,502
King Ding-a-ling.

1409
01:24:22,705 --> 01:24:24,900
Why don't you whip it out for her?

1410
01:24:25,105 --> 01:24:27,016
Yeah, right on your forehead.

1411
01:24:27,225 --> 01:24:28,340
Shut up.

1412
01:24:37,505 --> 01:24:38,654
There he is!
Let's go!

1413
01:24:38,905 --> 01:24:40,497
-Let's go!
-I'm on him!

1414
01:24:54,265 --> 01:24:55,664
What are our chances?

1415
01:24:55,905 --> 01:24:57,702
Remember Club Hell?

1416
01:24:57,945 --> 01:24:59,060
Worse.

1417
01:25:00,625 --> 01:25:05,380
That's it. Call major backup.
I want swimming ducks in here.

1418
01:25:05,585 --> 01:25:06,779
Hold it.

1419
01:25:06,985 --> 01:25:10,261
Sinclair tapped the phones.
We must do that in person.

1420
01:25:12,185 --> 01:25:13,777
By the time we do that...

1421
01:25:13,985 --> 01:25:17,500
...every junkie in America
will be high off our bust.

1422
01:25:19,265 --> 01:25:20,698
Can we help you?

1423
01:25:20,985 --> 01:25:25,536
I staked out all night
in that jalopy too. I earned a peek.

1424
01:25:26,265 --> 01:25:29,860
This is real cop stuff, okay?
Not Charlie's Angels.

1425
01:25:30,065 --> 01:25:32,295
Can't hurt for her to take a peek.

1426
01:25:32,505 --> 01:25:36,259
It can't? If they fire a bullet over
here, it'll hurt!

1427
01:25:44,345 --> 01:25:45,778
We have guests.

1428
01:25:46,385 --> 01:25:49,821
Have them followed.
Call me with their location.

1429
01:25:55,345 --> 01:25:59,657
This high-speed chase, ending
near River and 34th Streets...

1430
01:25:59,905 --> 01:26:02,465
...was captured 2 nights ago
by our news team.

1431
01:26:03,545 --> 01:26:04,978
Mom!!

1432
01:26:07,985 --> 01:26:11,864
I thought you said Daddy was in
Cleveland. Can't be.

1433
01:26:14,025 --> 01:26:16,664
No. Your daddy just wishes
he was in Cleveland.

1434
01:26:17,265 --> 01:26:20,575
I'm telling you, this Fouchet,
he's slick.

1435
01:26:21,785 --> 01:26:24,618
FBI, DEA, they got nothing on him.

1436
01:26:24,825 --> 01:26:27,180
But he got to deal with us today.

1437
01:26:37,625 --> 01:26:39,058
What's that?

1438
01:26:39,265 --> 01:26:41,495
That's the last time they handcuff me.

1439
01:26:41,745 --> 01:26:43,178
That's what.

1440
01:26:43,425 --> 01:26:44,824
Good boy.

1441
01:26:46,505 --> 01:26:48,621
Excuse me, ma'am. Ma'am!

1442
01:26:48,825 --> 01:26:50,861
All visitors must be announced!

1443
01:26:51,105 --> 01:26:52,504
Pisses me off!

1444
01:26:52,865 --> 01:26:54,503
Lady! Lady!

1445
01:26:55,865 --> 01:26:59,016
When you get back,
this'll be over, right?

1446
01:26:59,225 --> 01:27:00,544
You got that right.

1447
01:27:00,785 --> 01:27:03,777
Now don't worry.
You'll be set free.

1448
01:27:04,025 --> 01:27:05,014
Cut loose.

1449
01:27:05,265 --> 01:27:07,904
You'll be back to your own life.

1450
01:27:08,945 --> 01:27:10,856
No more handcuffs.

1451
01:27:14,985 --> 01:27:18,375
-I'm out of here.
-That's Chet with my veggie burger.

1452
01:27:18,625 --> 01:27:20,661
-Move your ass.
-You got it.

1453
01:27:24,185 --> 01:27:25,823
Hi, can I help you?

1454
01:27:26,025 --> 01:27:28,937
I'm here to kill
my husband, Marcus Burnett.

1455
01:27:29,145 --> 01:27:31,818
The tall one,
or the short one?

1456
01:27:32,065 --> 01:27:33,214
The short one.

1457
01:27:34,145 --> 01:27:35,373
Thought so.

1458
01:27:35,745 --> 01:27:37,019
Is Chet ringing--

1459
01:27:37,265 --> 01:27:38,778
Oh, babe!

1460
01:27:44,785 --> 01:27:46,343
Let me get your husband.

1461
01:27:46,985 --> 01:27:48,213
Get over here.

1462
01:27:50,945 --> 01:27:54,460
I know what it looks like.
Did you get my message?

1463
01:27:57,225 --> 01:27:58,738
Can you...

1464
01:27:58,945 --> 01:28:00,378
...leave me and...

1465
01:28:00,585 --> 01:28:02,416
...Mrs. Burnett alone?

1466
01:28:02,865 --> 01:28:04,184
Right.

1467
01:28:05,865 --> 01:28:07,184
Y'all met?

1468
01:28:07,865 --> 01:28:08,934
Baby....

1469
01:28:09,785 --> 01:28:11,696
I know-- Let me--

1470
01:28:11,905 --> 01:28:16,023
As far as I'm concerned, keep the
wedding ring in your pocket...

1471
01:28:16,265 --> 01:28:17,857
...because you, your girlfriend...

1472
01:28:18,105 --> 01:28:19,584
Oh, shit.

1473
01:28:19,825 --> 01:28:22,658
...and Mike will be
very happy living here.

1474
01:28:22,865 --> 01:28:24,617
Sweetie! Sweetie, honey!

1475
01:28:28,265 --> 01:28:30,301
No, no, I saw it on the news.

1476
01:28:30,905 --> 01:28:32,941
That shit's slanted.

1477
01:28:35,905 --> 01:28:37,736
You're no longer welcome to my house.

1478
01:28:37,945 --> 01:28:40,664
He didn't tell you
I was coming in early?

1479
01:28:40,905 --> 01:28:43,897
Remember, I said call,
and that you'd bring me here?

1480
01:28:44,385 --> 01:28:45,977
Tell her what l told you?

1481
01:28:46,225 --> 01:28:47,783
You'd bring me here--

1482
01:28:50,985 --> 01:28:52,782
I ain't even going to--

1483
01:28:53,185 --> 01:28:54,538
We're not arguing.

1484
01:28:54,745 --> 01:28:56,019
I'm raising my--

1485
01:28:56,265 --> 01:28:57,664
All right-- Baby!

1486
01:28:57,865 --> 01:28:59,378
We wanted to tell you.

1487
01:28:59,625 --> 01:29:04,255
It really doesn't matter, Mike, Kojak--
whatever your name is.

1488
01:29:04,625 --> 01:29:06,741
I'll tell you something else:

1489
01:29:06,985 --> 01:29:10,773
If his wife can find us,
I'm better off on my own.

1490
01:29:10,985 --> 01:29:12,213
This....

1491
01:29:12,545 --> 01:29:14,137
I can see how it'd look a trip.

1492
01:29:15,225 --> 01:29:17,978
You see me, I run out,
I got a shirt open.

1493
01:29:18,225 --> 01:29:19,897
You see Mike half-naked.

1494
01:29:20,105 --> 01:29:22,016
Then you see the white girl.

1495
01:29:22,265 --> 01:29:26,258
It looks like we having an orgy,
and ain't nobody humped.

1496
01:29:26,505 --> 01:29:28,780
Ain't nobody doing none of that.

1497
01:29:28,985 --> 01:29:31,545
It's not what it looks like, okay?

1498
01:29:31,825 --> 01:29:34,100
Baby, she's a material witness.

1499
01:29:35,025 --> 01:29:36,663
That's real!

1500
01:29:36,865 --> 01:29:38,457
Baby, Theresa, listen.

1501
01:29:38,665 --> 01:29:41,179
It was orders.
Listen, it was orders.

1502
01:29:42,665 --> 01:29:46,453
Can I talk to you?
Can you stop so I can talk to you?

1503
01:29:46,665 --> 01:29:49,941
Enough smooth shit, Mike.
It's not going to work anymore.

1504
01:29:58,865 --> 01:29:59,854
I don't care!

1505
01:30:06,265 --> 01:30:07,300
Duck!

1506
01:30:07,505 --> 01:30:08,699
Julie, get down!

1507
01:30:08,905 --> 01:30:09,974
Get down!!

1508
01:30:40,305 --> 01:30:41,499
Get out!

1509
01:30:48,625 --> 01:30:50,138
91 1 !

1510
01:30:53,505 --> 01:30:55,177
91 1? Chet here.

1511
01:30:55,385 --> 01:30:57,455
Go upstairs and take this!
Take it!

1512
01:30:59,745 --> 01:31:02,384
I'll keep everyone calm
until my backup comes.

1513
01:31:02,625 --> 01:31:04,104
I love you.

1514
01:31:05,145 --> 01:31:07,056
I forgot to give the address!

1515
01:31:41,785 --> 01:31:43,184
Go, go, go!

1516
01:31:43,425 --> 01:31:44,335
Watch out!

1517
01:31:44,545 --> 01:31:45,944
Keep going!

1518
01:31:48,505 --> 01:31:49,301
Get her in!

1519
01:32:16,985 --> 01:32:18,054
Move!

1520
01:32:31,345 --> 01:32:32,255
It's okay.

1521
01:32:32,465 --> 01:32:35,218
I'm with the police. lt's cool.
You look great.

1522
01:33:01,305 --> 01:33:02,135
Drive!

1523
01:33:36,945 --> 01:33:39,220
Don't ever say I wasn't there for you.

1524
01:33:51,825 --> 01:33:52,894
What is it with you?

1525
01:33:53,105 --> 01:33:55,221
How come it always has to be
good news/bad news?

1526
01:33:55,425 --> 01:33:58,656
You know where the dope is, but you lose
our witness.

1527
01:33:58,905 --> 01:34:00,099
I don't get it!

1528
01:34:00,305 --> 01:34:01,420
Telephone!

1529
01:34:04,585 --> 01:34:08,942
I'm keeping your friend for 4
hours, until I make my deal.

1530
01:34:09,145 --> 01:34:10,373
And I will make it.

1531
01:34:11,385 --> 01:34:13,296
I just put a bullet in the chemist...

1532
01:34:13,545 --> 01:34:16,105
...who fucked with my timetable.

1533
01:34:16,865 --> 01:34:19,299
The other one is for the girl. Okay?

1534
01:34:19,505 --> 01:34:20,984
Son of a bitch!

1535
01:34:24,105 --> 01:34:26,300
That twisted motherfucker
shot one of his employees.

1536
01:34:26,545 --> 01:34:28,854
Says if we don't back up,
he'll kill Julie.

1537
01:34:29,065 --> 01:34:30,134
Not now!

1538
01:34:30,385 --> 01:34:31,738
I told you to play by the rules.

1539
01:34:31,945 --> 01:34:34,334
I'm on the verge of solving this case!

1540
01:34:34,585 --> 01:34:37,736
I've finally got the authority
to shut you down.

1541
01:34:37,985 --> 01:34:39,543
You're all reassigned.

1542
01:34:45,225 --> 01:34:48,137
This guy is painting me into a corner.

1543
01:34:48,385 --> 01:34:50,421
We won't let the girl die.

1544
01:34:50,665 --> 01:34:53,737
We're not walking away.
I don't care what she says.

1545
01:34:53,985 --> 01:34:55,941
The deal goes down in 4 hours.

1546
01:34:56,585 --> 01:34:58,940
You got 2 hours to find them.

1547
01:34:59,985 --> 01:35:01,703
It's time to get lucky.

1548
01:35:02,625 --> 01:35:04,297
Go do what you got to do.

1549
01:35:06,145 --> 01:35:10,582
You told us that this thing would
move a little quicker.

1550
01:35:10,825 --> 01:35:14,340
It's not that easy.
If it was, you'd be doing it.

1551
01:35:14,825 --> 01:35:17,214
Work your magic.
You say you're a computer whiz.

1552
01:35:18,185 --> 01:35:21,382
Back off! I'm doing an illegal
favor for you.

1553
01:35:21,625 --> 01:35:23,536
This is what I went to jail for.

1554
01:35:23,745 --> 01:35:25,064
So you back up off me.

1555
01:35:25,265 --> 01:35:27,256
You don't sit your lanky ass down...

1556
01:35:27,945 --> 01:35:30,743
...bottom line,
I will knock you out.

1557
01:35:30,945 --> 01:35:31,980
What's wrong with you?

1558
01:35:32,225 --> 01:35:34,455
-Can you have a seat?
-You said I'd get out of jail.

1559
01:35:34,665 --> 01:35:36,223
And I wasn't lying.

1560
01:35:38,985 --> 01:35:40,657
Cops are so dumb. Look.

1561
01:35:42,985 --> 01:35:45,021
Remember, you promised
to get me out.

1562
01:35:46,785 --> 01:35:48,059
Eddie Dominguez.

1563
01:35:49,505 --> 01:35:50,779
There it is.

1564
01:35:54,505 --> 01:35:55,620
Girlfriend?

1565
01:36:03,265 --> 01:36:06,735
It was New Year's Eve,
and my ex-boyfriend, Eddie...

1566
01:36:06,985 --> 01:36:08,703
...and this French guy...

1567
01:36:09,145 --> 01:36:11,739
...they took some
horrible pictures of me.

1568
01:36:11,985 --> 01:36:13,134
They said...

1569
01:36:13,385 --> 01:36:17,219
...they'd post them
at my kid's school...

1570
01:36:17,465 --> 01:36:20,298
...unless I gave them
narcotics information.

1571
01:36:20,505 --> 01:36:23,019
But I never, never gave them you...

1572
01:36:23,225 --> 01:36:24,499
...or the girl.

1573
01:36:24,745 --> 01:36:27,100
They got her.
We need to get them now.

1574
01:36:27,905 --> 01:36:31,102
If we don't, she's dead.
How do you make contact?

1575
01:36:31,345 --> 01:36:33,256
I have their mobile-phone number.

1576
01:36:35,745 --> 01:36:37,781
I know, I'm sorry.

1577
01:36:38,025 --> 01:36:40,823
I'll make it up to you.
I will.

1578
01:36:41,025 --> 01:36:43,061
We don't have time. Let's go.

1579
01:36:46,785 --> 01:36:48,741
You have sexy ears, you know that?

1580
01:36:48,945 --> 01:36:50,344
I want to lick them.

1581
01:36:54,305 --> 01:36:55,420
Can I speak to Romeo?

1582
01:36:55,665 --> 01:36:57,542
There's no Romeo here, asshole.

1583
01:36:58,265 --> 01:36:59,095
What're you laughing at?

1584
01:36:59,425 --> 01:37:03,703
This cell phone will triangulate him,
no matter where he goes.

1585
01:37:03,945 --> 01:37:06,095
We watch the map until he stops.

1586
01:37:09,545 --> 01:37:11,775
The signal's still strong.

1587
01:37:12,585 --> 01:37:13,859
Come on.

1588
01:37:15,385 --> 01:37:16,534
Thank you.

1589
01:37:17,145 --> 01:37:19,818
Lucy was the queen, baby.
Think about it.

1590
01:37:20,065 --> 01:37:22,056
Lucille Ball was a bimbo.

1591
01:37:22,265 --> 01:37:24,938
-Desi was the brains behind it.
-How can you say that?

1592
01:37:25,145 --> 01:37:26,055
What do you mean?

1593
01:37:26,305 --> 01:37:28,535
Take the bongos away, he's nothing.

1594
01:37:28,745 --> 01:37:29,939
It's conga!

1595
01:37:31,065 --> 01:37:32,657
Yo, fellas, what's up?

1596
01:37:33,145 --> 01:37:34,942
The fucking pencil squad.

1597
01:37:35,185 --> 01:37:36,618
Are we on traffic duty?

1598
01:37:36,865 --> 01:37:40,221
No, this is real.
We got something for you.

1599
01:37:40,425 --> 01:37:41,619
You could get killed.

1600
01:37:45,625 --> 01:37:46,819
Let's go.

1601
01:37:59,705 --> 01:38:00,979
It's Conrad.

1602
01:38:01,345 --> 01:38:02,903
I'm calling in a favor.

1603
01:38:05,065 --> 01:38:07,215
Eastbound towards 135th Street.

1604
01:38:09,185 --> 01:38:10,903
Northeast, go northeast.

1605
01:38:11,105 --> 01:38:13,699
If I'm wrong, you can fire me.

1606
01:38:14,025 --> 01:38:15,697
This is what I need:

1607
01:38:16,025 --> 01:38:19,415
I need a SWAT team, helicopters.
We're calling all cars.

1608
01:38:19,665 --> 01:38:21,860
Only I don't know where I need them.

1609
01:38:23,465 --> 01:38:24,693
Nice car.

1610
01:38:24,905 --> 01:38:26,099
Oh, yeah.

1611
01:38:26,665 --> 01:38:27,893
That's my toy.

1612
01:38:28,105 --> 01:38:30,300
I'm taking it with me
for my collection.

1613
01:38:30,905 --> 01:38:33,544
And how about the wire transfers?

1614
01:38:34,985 --> 01:38:37,704
Two wire transfers to your banks...

1615
01:38:38,465 --> 01:38:40,899
...totalling 180 million dollars.

1616
01:38:42,305 --> 01:38:43,704
And 20 in cash.

1617
01:38:48,985 --> 01:38:49,940
Damn.

1618
01:38:54,385 --> 01:38:56,455
This has been a shitty week.

1619
01:38:57,785 --> 01:39:00,345
Getting full integration on that signal.

1620
01:39:04,905 --> 01:39:07,135
We're on the airfield now.

1621
01:39:07,345 --> 01:39:09,381
I bet it's up in the old hangar section.

1622
01:39:15,385 --> 01:39:17,262
Pick it up! Pick it up!

1623
01:39:18,145 --> 01:39:20,136
Deposit confirmation requested.

1624
01:39:20,345 --> 01:39:22,415
$90 million, Geldersbank of Zurich.

1625
01:39:27,385 --> 01:39:28,454
No easy approach.

1626
01:39:28,665 --> 01:39:30,144
No time.
Fuck the backup.

1627
01:39:30,385 --> 01:39:31,613
We must go now.

1628
01:39:33,105 --> 01:39:34,094
Not a problem.

1629
01:39:37,145 --> 01:39:39,978
You got an itch?
I'd love to scratch it.

1630
01:39:40,225 --> 01:39:43,456
-Scratch this.
-I'll scratch whatever you want.

1631
01:39:45,065 --> 01:39:46,054
Did you go to college?

1632
01:39:56,425 --> 01:39:57,335
Thank you.

1633
01:39:59,225 --> 01:40:01,693
-You sure you want to do this?
-Let's go!

1634
01:40:01,945 --> 01:40:03,424
Tuck in your skirt.

1635
01:40:03,665 --> 01:40:05,337
My shit always works sometimes.

1636
01:40:09,665 --> 01:40:13,021
This is the best you can buy.
Nice doing business with you.

1637
01:40:24,065 --> 01:40:25,054
Oh, shit.

1638
01:40:26,265 --> 01:40:27,823
It's a setup!

1639
01:40:34,305 --> 01:40:36,296
If I get killed,
I'm fucking you up!

1640
01:40:39,065 --> 01:40:40,464
Goddamn it, go!

1641
01:40:43,705 --> 01:40:44,899
Go, goddamn it!

1642
01:41:02,705 --> 01:41:03,615
My God!

1643
01:42:19,345 --> 01:42:20,494
Get down!

1644
01:42:28,145 --> 01:42:29,658
You forgot your boarding pass!

1645
01:42:52,865 --> 01:42:54,742
You motherfuckers!

1646
01:42:56,025 --> 01:42:56,821
What's up?

1647
01:42:58,505 --> 01:42:59,494
Shit!

1648
01:43:51,465 --> 01:43:52,944
Let's go!

1649
01:43:53,425 --> 01:43:54,699
Get in the car!

1650
01:43:57,865 --> 01:43:59,696
Get in, Mike! Come on!

1651
01:44:00,745 --> 01:44:01,541
Get in!

1652
01:44:02,185 --> 01:44:03,220
Get in the car!

1653
01:44:03,625 --> 01:44:05,536
This shit's going to blow!

1654
01:44:06,825 --> 01:44:08,053
Get up!

1655
01:44:28,185 --> 01:44:31,143
Shit! Please, catch that motherfucker,
he shot me.

1656
01:44:31,865 --> 01:44:32,934
He shot me!

1657
01:44:33,985 --> 01:44:37,102
I'm fine. I just had a run-in
with Jim Brown over here.

1658
01:44:38,825 --> 01:44:40,178
He steals our shit...

1659
01:44:40,425 --> 01:44:41,460
...kidnaps Julie...

1660
01:44:41,705 --> 01:44:45,061
...shoots at my wife.
We beat him down!

1661
01:44:48,625 --> 01:44:51,185
Marcus, I just got
one question for you.

1662
01:44:51,425 --> 01:44:54,462
How can you leave me at a gunfight
to get the car?!

1663
01:44:54,705 --> 01:44:56,821
Shut up and let him drive.

1664
01:45:04,385 --> 01:45:06,853
Getting shot improved
your driving skills.

1665
01:45:10,905 --> 01:45:12,543
You got the right to remain silent.

1666
01:45:14,985 --> 01:45:18,500
Anything you say will be used
against you in a court of law.

1667
01:45:18,785 --> 01:45:19,661
What're you doing?

1668
01:45:19,905 --> 01:45:20,860
Getting it out the way.

1669
01:45:31,265 --> 01:45:32,493
Punch it!

1670
01:45:38,505 --> 01:45:39,824
What if his car's faster?

1671
01:45:40,065 --> 01:45:40,941
It's not!

1672
01:45:41,145 --> 01:45:44,501
It'll be one or the other!
It'll be him or it'll be us!

1673
01:45:48,225 --> 01:45:49,578
You better win!

1674
01:45:50,265 --> 01:45:52,301
You better win!

1675
01:46:11,825 --> 01:46:13,816
That's how you're supposed to drive!

1676
01:46:14,065 --> 01:46:16,704
From now on, that's how you drive!

1677
01:46:42,025 --> 01:46:43,458
Freeze!

1678
01:46:48,545 --> 01:46:49,819
He ain't worth killing.

1679
01:46:54,705 --> 01:46:55,501
Freeze!

1680
01:47:22,585 --> 01:47:24,974
Bet when your punk-ass
woke up this morning...

1681
01:47:25,225 --> 01:47:28,820
...you didn't think by 5:00
you'd have a hole in your leg.

1682
01:47:32,385 --> 01:47:34,979
You couldn't kill me,
you chickenshit, could you?

1683
01:47:35,665 --> 01:47:37,576
I could.
You're talking like it's over.

1684
01:47:37,785 --> 01:47:39,138
I'm just pausing.

1685
01:47:39,865 --> 01:47:42,618
I'm getting the hang of this
marksman shit.

1686
01:47:43,105 --> 01:47:46,620
Shooting them from 30 yards
while they run, that's not it.

1687
01:47:46,825 --> 01:47:47,894
Here's where it is.

1688
01:47:48,625 --> 01:47:50,263
Up close and personal.

1689
01:47:51,905 --> 01:47:53,861
That's what I'm talking about.

1690
01:47:54,625 --> 01:47:55,535
Would you do it?

1691
01:47:56,545 --> 01:47:57,455
Step off!

1692
01:47:58,985 --> 01:48:00,100
Do it!

1693
01:48:00,345 --> 01:48:01,221
Do it!!

1694
01:48:09,865 --> 01:48:11,184
It's over.

1695
01:48:17,025 --> 01:48:18,014
He's a joke.

1696
01:48:18,625 --> 01:48:20,297
He's a motherfucking joke.

1697
01:48:44,705 --> 01:48:47,299
I ever tell you I love you, man?

1698
01:48:47,945 --> 01:48:51,574
You always be getting emotional
after a gunfight.

1699
01:48:52,305 --> 01:48:53,943
Because I'm glad we survived.

1700
01:48:54,185 --> 01:48:55,618
Shit.

1701
01:48:58,785 --> 01:49:00,537
I love you too.

1702
01:49:01,425 --> 01:49:04,656
Don't be looking at me. I love you.
I said that shit.

1703
01:49:04,905 --> 01:49:05,815
You my boy!

1704
01:49:06,385 --> 01:49:08,615
No, no, you like my brother, man.

1705
01:49:08,865 --> 01:49:10,298
So what am I?

1706
01:49:12,665 --> 01:49:14,542
Julie, sweetie, you....

1707
01:49:14,785 --> 01:49:16,616
You're a little dangerous.

1708
01:49:16,865 --> 01:49:20,653
See, you like a magnet
for random gunfire.

1709
01:49:21,625 --> 01:49:23,024
But you're cool.

1710
01:49:23,545 --> 01:49:25,297
You're down.

1711
01:49:26,585 --> 01:49:28,621
So what's next?

1712
01:49:32,025 --> 01:49:32,980
See...

1713
01:49:33,345 --> 01:49:35,256
...there won't be no next.

1714
01:49:38,305 --> 01:49:39,977
You wanted Mike Lowrey...

1715
01:49:40,225 --> 01:49:41,340
...you got him.

1716
01:49:41,585 --> 01:49:42,859
That's Mike.

1717
01:49:43,105 --> 01:49:44,220
Old Mike Lowrey.

1718
01:49:44,505 --> 01:49:47,941
I'm going home to my wife
to get my quality time.

1719
01:49:48,585 --> 01:49:49,984
Stop playing, man.

1720
01:49:50,225 --> 01:49:52,785
I've been beat 3 times out here.

1721
01:49:53,025 --> 01:49:56,813
I'm cool, I don't need no help.
Back up.

1722
01:49:57,105 --> 01:50:01,018
Why're you going home to your wife?
Your dick probably don't work.

1723
01:50:01,265 --> 01:50:03,495
Do you have the keys?

1724
01:50:03,985 --> 01:50:06,863
Mike wanted me to go
to this gunfight, then....

1725
01:50:07,065 --> 01:50:09,420
Well, then
there was this witness....

1726
01:50:10,625 --> 01:50:11,978
My man!

1727
01:50:12,785 --> 01:50:13,820
You let me out of here?

1728
01:50:14,105 --> 01:50:17,654
-I don't got the keys.
-What do you mean you don't have keys?!
