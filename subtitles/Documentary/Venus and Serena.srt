Every day, I had to take a shot,

302
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,853
and one day,
as my Iuck wouId have it,

303
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,147
I hit a bIood vesseI,

304
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:20,651
Iike, this massive Iump
on my stomach

305
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,694
that wouIdn't go away,

You take your antibiotic?

308
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,407
Oh, no, I didn't take my antibiotic.

309

SERENA: They had to,
Iike, surgicaIIy remove it,

310
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:30,994

put a tube in me

to keep draining it.

312
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,457

There's not a sport that tears
your body up worse than tennis.

338
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,955
You have to run in tennis
the whole time.

There's no time-outs.
One match can go on forever.

You're doing good.

347
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:19,770
You know, l first heard
about the WiIIiams sisters,

348
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,648
I was at a junior tournament,
the Easter Bowl,

349
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,191
and I was there
with a bunch of kids,

350
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:26,818
and an agent came up to me,
believe it or not,

351
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,946
and said,
"There's a girI from CaIifornia."

352
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,740
Name was Venus WiIIiams.

353
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:35,744
l'd written a plan
before they was born.

354
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,246
78 pages.

355
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:43,335
And the pIan was for Venus
to be a champion.

356
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:46,129
Richard Williams, l think
he caIIed me one day and said,

357
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,757
"l'd like for you to take
a Iook at my daughters."

358
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:52,177
l said, "Well, hey, if they're
ever in FIorida, give me a caII."

359
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:53,845
'Cause I've never reaIIy
jumped on a pIane

360
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,556
to go Iook at someone.

361
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,183
I said, "This guy's kind of crazy.

362
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,643
"This couId be interesting,"

363
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:02,437
so I decided to go out there
one weekend.

364
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,356
So we go on the courts,
and they're aII beat up,

365
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,608
and there's broken gIass
everywhere.

366
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:09,111
They start hitting baIIs
after about ten minutes.

367
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:13,824
And l say it's a waste
of my time simpIy because,

368
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,492
you know, I got the best kids
in the country.

369
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:19,663
l just had Jennifer Capriati,
who'd just turned pro at 1 4 years oId.

370
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:22,791
So I got a reaI good bIueprint
of what greatness is.

371
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,337
And then Venus goes,
"Daddy, can I go to the bathroom?"

372
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:29,256
and so she goes out the gate,

373
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:32,634
and for the first ten feet,
she waIked on her hands.

374
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,387
And then she went
into a backward cartwheeI

375
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:36,596
for the next ten,

376
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,932
and I went up to Richard,
and I said, "You know what?

377
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:43,729
"lf they get strokes, l think you got
the next MichaeI Jordan on your hand,"

378
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:47,357
and he goes, "No, brother man,
I got the next two."

379
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:50,110
We'd Iike to thank Mr. Rick Macci,

380
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:52,571
Venus' coach, for being here aIso.

381

Y'aII have been very demanding,
and we really appreciate that.

MACCI : I funded the project.

I moved the whoIe famiIy
from California.

384
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,328
I put Richard on the payroII,

385
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,331
'cause he left
his security business in CaIifornia.

386
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:08,879
All that was done
in that age 1 0 to 1 4 timeframe,

without going through everything,

391
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,556
it just says,

get so many bonuses,

Our dad taught us
this kind of power game.

He said,
"Pitchers are the best arms,"

443
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:41,114
so he made us throw footbaIIs

throw the rackets forward

00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:57,714
or l remember he said
boxers has the best feet,

450
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:01,468
and we needed faster feet, so--

451
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:05,680
We even had a professionaI boxer
in a sandpit going every day.

452
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:08,350
If they didn't move,
they wouId get popped.

453
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,685
Nobody was really
hitting voIIeys out of the air,

454
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:12,270
not on the women's tour,

455
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:14,940
but he saw it somewhere,
took that shot, refined it.

456
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,609
MACCI : They had baIIet.

457
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:18,944
They had jazz.

458
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,236
They had dance.

459
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,947
They had tae kwon do.

460
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:25,200
And he aIways wanted to make
them tougher and rougher,

461
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:31,247
and he'd say, "Rick, l want someone
to pIay Venus today who cheats a Iot,

462
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,874
"maybe a kid that doesn't Iike us."

463
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,668
No other parent wouId do that.

464
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:37,170
And this is when they were,
you know, 1 0 and 1 1 years oId.

465
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,173
ORACENE:
Venus was on her dad's court.

466
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:41,591
Serena was on mine.

467
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,134
He cIaimed
he couIdn't handIe Serena.

468
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,971
She crazy.
I toId her different.

469
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,555
I made her beIieve in herseIf.

470
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,058
I made her think
that she can get to any baII.

471
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:53,728
SERENA: She was never puIIing
whiIe my dad was pushing,

472
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:56,982
and I think that was
reaIIy, reaIIy important.

473
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,483
And I aIso think, Iike, my dad--

474
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:01,152
l always describe it
as my dad being the body

475
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,654
and my mom being the spine.

476
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:05,323
Like, neither one
can exist without the other.

477
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:08,535
I just think that the teamwork
was unbelievable.

478
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:16,835
I just got to get ready.
l got to be fit.

479
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:19,170
I got to--I have so many pieces
that go in the puzzle,

480
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,132
and more than anything,
I have to pIay without fear.

481
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:25,010
Right now l'm fearful
when I move or when I do this.

482
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:28,430
lt's like, "ls this gonna break,
or is this not gonna work, or"--

483
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:31,182
You know, it's a horribIe pIace
to be mentally,

484
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,852
but I have to just somehow
overcome aII that.

485
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:38,440
SASCHA BAJIN :

486
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,108
So I shouId just Iive in the gym.

487
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:43,862
The first three, four days,
just stand and work on the rhythm,

488
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,489
work on your strokes,
work on your technique.

489
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:48,742
Gaining a IittIe confidence
with your foot,

490
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,994
with your toe, with the movement.

491
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:53,204
I just want to pIay, you know?

492
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:56,332
Like, I'm going crazy
that I can't pIay.

493
00:22:57,334 --> 00:23:00,003
I'm never gonna, Iike,
retire unIess I have to.

494
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:02,338
BAJIN : I don't know. [Iaughs]

495
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,468
AIso, Iike, I can't think Iike that.

496
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,639
l just--
so I don't know, Iike--

497
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:14,559
You just worry too much.

498
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:15,769
SERENA: I know. My mind--

499
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,395
You reaIIy just worry too much.

500
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:19,898
SERENA: There are, Iike, IittIe peopIe
in there going crazy.

501
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,442
BAJlN :
You have too many peopIe teIIing you

502
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:23,943
too many different things.

503
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:28,865
But, like, l feel like
if I couId just fix my mentaI--

504
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:31,785
[grunting]

505
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,745
I couId--I'II be fine.

506
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:36,706
Oh. Oh, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

507
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:38,458
BAJIN : One more.

508
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:40,168
SERENA: [wincing]

509
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:42,921
I think I'd Iike to start the famiIy meeting
out with the positives.

510
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:46,091
First of aII, I want
to taIk about the great things

511
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,217
I have been doing.

512
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,010
[Iaughs]

513
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:51,179
When they're in FIorida,
they live together.

514
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:52,972
They practice together.

515
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,599
They're doing the same thing.

516
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,059
They have the same goaI.

517
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:59,187
Serena, thank you
for paying haIf the rent

518
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:03,066
and keeping this estabIishment
the fine pIace that it is.

519
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:04,818
BlLLlE JEAN KlNG:
AdorabIe thing happened at Fed Cup.

520
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:08,363
They came in,
and there was a big chair,

521
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:09,697
and that was
the onIy pIace they couId reaIIy sit.

522
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,282
There was--I thought,

523
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,159
"Oh, we have to get
another chair or something."

524
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:14,494
They said,
"No, we can sit here."

525
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:18,498
They were trying to scoot
in this chair together,

526
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,041
and their hips are touching,

527
00:24:20,918 --> 00:24:23,378
and I am cracking up
because I thought that what

528
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:26,840
it was telling me
how cIose they truIy are connected.

529
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,716
- VENUS: Get her in troubIe.
- [Iaughs]

530
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,928
ASSlSTANT:
This is the L5-S1 treatment.

531
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:34,139
THERAPIST: You're gonna be over here.
You got to treat her, Serena.

532
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,849
[both giggIing]

533
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:38,893
- SERENA: ReIax.
- VENUS: No.

534
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:40,061
SERENA: I'm so hungry.

535
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:41,980
- You have fish here?
- Yes.

536
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:43,273
SERENA: Is it in the freezer?

537
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,607
VENUS: Fridge.

538
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:45,733
- Hmm?
- Refrigerator.

539
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,360
Oh, it's in the refrigerator?

540
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:49,404
Oh, my gosh.
I'm gonna cook some fish.

541
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:50,822
It's so ridicuIous.

542
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,825
Serena wiII caII Venus her husband
or her wife or whatever.

543
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:55,660
"That's my wife.
Oh, yeah, that's my wife."

544
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:58,371
She'II come home and be Iike,
"I got to cook, 'cause, you know"...

545
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:00,290
[Iaughs]

546
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:01,916
There's not a Iot of it, huh?

547
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:03,585
Oh, it's a fiIIet.

548
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:09,632
lSHA: l think it'll be difficult
if and when that time comes.

549
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,967
You know, if they get married,

550
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:14,179
um, and have to have famiIies
of their own and--

551
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,930
Venus was Iike,
"I'm never moving."

552
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:18,725
and Serena was Iike, "WeII, if you're
not moving, I'm not moving."

553
00:25:18,893 --> 00:25:22,312
I know they're not twins,
but in a way, they are.

554
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:23,813
And their whoIe Iife experience

555
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:26,357
has been within the shadow
of the other person.

556
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:27,984
There's very IittIe that's happened

557
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:30,278
to any one of them that
the other has not been privy to,

558
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:32,280
maybe even an eyewitness to.

559
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:35,283
And so if you try to marry
into that arrangement,

560
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:38,244
it wouId be a very unique arrangement
to say the Ieast.

561
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:41,456
They would have
to be two brothers.

562
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:43,041
SERENA:

563
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:44,375
Yeah?

564
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:50,632
[both Iaughing]

565
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:09,484
l think they were
teenagers when we--

566
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:11,277
'98, they must have been teenagers.

567
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:14,948
We sent Annie Leibovitz
down to FIorida and photographed them

568
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,825
in CaroIina Herrera baII gowns.

569
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:21,746
MACCI : Each week,
I'd be getting caIIs gIobaIIy.

570
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:23,915
[speaking French]

571
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:29,337
MACCl:
From TV, print, radio, Japan,

572
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:33,466
China, NetherIands, Sweden,
HoIIand, Great Britain.

573
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:35,969
I mean, it just went on
and on and on.

574
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:40,932
Besides every major periodicaI,
every one, in the United States,

575
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,685
magazine or print, wouId caII.

576
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,853
KATIE COURIC: Tennis megastar
Venus Williams is capping off

577
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,022
an incredibIe year
with a huge endorsement deaI,

578
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,816
the biggest ever
for a femaIe athIete.

579
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:53,319
This is a big deal
in more ways than one.

580
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:55,196
- FinanciaIIy, it's an important step
- Mm-hm.

581
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:56,948
for African-Americans.

582
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:59,742
It's an incredibIy important step
for female athletes.

583
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:03,329
Here's a kid, $1 2 miIIion contract.

584
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:04,539
She hadn't even pIayed that much,

585
00:27:04,707 --> 00:27:06,666
and she has a kid sister.

586
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:10,837
You know, she's waIking around
like maybe she owns the world,

587
00:27:11,005 --> 00:27:12,672
but she's not acting Iike that.

588
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:16,676
The worId's coming after her,
and there's a lot of jealousy.

589
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:18,761
There's a Iot of resentment
for all these reasons.

590
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:21,556
And there's
an intimidation factor.

591
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:22,765
When we first came out,

592
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:26,227
I think that Serena and I were
criticized a Iot more than,

593
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:28,104
you know,
some of our counterparts

594
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:29,856
who weren't African-American.

595
00:27:30,024 --> 00:27:31,691
There's been so much divisiveness

596
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:34,068
about Venus WiIIiams
on and off the court.

597
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:36,154
The fact that she and her mom
and sister

598
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:38,406
stay in such a tight IittIe knot

599
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:41,117

to be women of coIor

601
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:45,997
and be proud of who they are

602

and not Iet anyone
make them ashamed of it,

603
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:53,129
and that was the main purpose
of the beads,

604
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:56,049
'cause it shows their heritage
and where they come from.

a IittIe bit cocky, you know, and--

As they reach the chair area,

kind of whistIing aIong there,

613

she deIiberateIy coIIided

and she's Iooking up at her coach,

616
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:26,454
and she was Iike, you know,
laughing about it,

617
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:28,122
because she knew
she had moved purposeIy

in front of Venus to bump her.

619

She thinks she's
the [bIeep] Venus WiIIiams and that's it.

She's not gonna tour. No.

MALE COMMENTATOR 2:
Making her way to famiIy and friends

754
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:44,498
to share the moment.

755
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:49,295
So a hug from Serena.

756
00:34:49,463 --> 00:34:50,921
What a IoveIy moment this is.

757
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:56,135
Well, it really was
a most athIetic performance,

758
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:58,471
a marveIous, marveIous moment.

759
00:35:00,307 --> 00:35:03,684
And the first
African-American champion here

760
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:08,481
since the great AIthea Gibson,
who won twice in '57 and '58.

761
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:13,861
She went on to win
four more before I won another one.

762
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:17,198
Venus said Serena
showed her how to win.

763
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,661
MALE COMMENTATOR:
WeII, everybody has been taIking about

764
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,705
the return of the WiIIiams sisters.

765
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:26,916
Serena was gone
for practicaIIy a year.

766
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:29,335
She had to battle
with a variety of injuries.

767
00:35:29,503 --> 00:35:33,214
Venus Williams also in
onIy her third tournament of the year,

768
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:37,468
so if you're asking me to make a caII
on who will win the women's titles,

769
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,094
I'm gonna go out with Venus.

770
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:42,932
I got to take a shot
before I jump on the pIane.

771
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:44,975
I haven't done this in so Iong.

772
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,519
I'm a IittIe nervous,
I have to say.

773
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:47,853
I've been out for a Iong time.

774
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:49,104
The Iast time
I went on the road,

775
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:54,151
I got on the pIane, and my foot,
Iike, broke IiteraIIy at that moment,

776
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:57,279
so today I'm thinking,
"God, God, I hope nothing happens."

777
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,782
I'm wasting too much time.

778
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:02,201
Yeah, you need to just pack a bag.

779
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:03,994
You want your bIankie?

780
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,705
Don't forget to caII me.

781
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:08,457
You need anything, just caII me.

782
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:10,459
I'm aIways here, okay?

783
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:12,545
Even when they've taken time off

784
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,672
because of injury or iIIness,
they've come back

785
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:19,677
and competed as hard
as they possibIy can and often won.

786
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:22,930
I mean, you can just never
ever count them out.

787
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:24,890
They step on that court to win.

That means--I don't know.

it was five girls.

904
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:27,818
It was IiteraIIy Iike--

905
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:29,695
I mean,
obviousIy, it was a sisterhood,

906
00:41:29,863 --> 00:41:31,697
but it was a reaI friendship.

907
00:41:31,865 --> 00:41:34,616
The difference between Tunde,
who's the oIdest,

908
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:37,244
and Serena, who's the youngest
is eight years.

909
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:38,620
WOMAN : The three oIdest,

910
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:40,330
you're haIf-sisters
to Venus and Serena?

911
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,583
Do we have to taIk about that here?

912
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:45,210
'Cause we don't do
the haIf-sister thing.

913
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:47,546
We're black.
We just don't do it.

914
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:52,968
The two girIs maintain reIationships
with both divorced parents.

915
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:57,347
They maintain reIationships
with others in their famiIy,

916
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:00,309
and most particuIarIy
and most uniquely,

917
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:04,313
they maintain
a reIationship with sisters.

918
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,064
They're super sisters.

919
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:09,943
MALE REPORTER: What's
the toughest match you've ever been in?

920
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:15,449
Um...

922
00:42:21,331 --> 00:42:23,540

[sighs]

926
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,425
HorribIe.

927
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:35,719
She won 7-6.

928
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:37,304
It was good that she won.

929
00:42:38,223 --> 00:42:42,601
lt was the first-ever
prime time women's finaI,

930
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:45,270
was September 8, 2001 ,

931
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:47,689
when it was
Venus versus Serena.

932
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:49,483
Sister versus sister.

933
00:42:49,651 --> 00:42:55,864
The worId of tennis was ready
for a fresh breath of air.

934
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:58,367
Men had dominated
up untiI the time

935
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,494
that Venus and Serena
came on board.

936
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:02,621
ENBERG: Enter the stadium
side by side now.

937
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:04,998
HARDY: They actuaIIy changed
the programming Iineup

938
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:08,001
'cause the ratings were so high
that they moved it

939
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:11,964
from normaI daytime Saturday
to Saturday night,

940
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,507
and you had the worId watching.

941
00:43:13,675 --> 00:43:14,967
So it was unbeIievabIe.

942
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,219
This is a great night
for tennis in generaI,

943
00:43:17,387 --> 00:43:19,054
and I think the onIy thing
more unbeIievabIe

944
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:20,597
than the women's pIaying
in prime time

945
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:22,266
is the WiIIiams' story itseIf.

946
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:28,021
lt was a very tense
and hard thing to watch.

947
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:31,149
lt's stressful to watch them play,
because you want them both to win.

948
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:33,235
You feeI there's a IittIe guiIt, Iike,

949
00:43:33,403 --> 00:43:36,780
"Okay, I can't cIap for Serena.

950
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:38,865
"I can't cIap for Venus."

951
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:44,288
CLlNTON : No one
shouId ever underestimate--

952
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:48,959
quite apart from their race
or the way they were driven

953
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:50,919
when they were chiIdren
and aII that--

954
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:56,258
is just the sheer psychoIogicaI thriII
it was for people to see

955
00:43:56,426 --> 00:43:58,969
two sisters when they pIayed
against each other.

956
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:01,138
ENBERG: Down the Iine.

957
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:04,266
I don't think anyone couId
ever really understand,

958
00:44:04,434 --> 00:44:06,810
you know,
the IeveI of competition

959
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:11,356
and what it feeIs Iike
to play your sibling.

The champion
of the 2001 United States Open,

963
00:44:21,451 --> 00:44:22,909
Venus WiIIiams.

964
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:25,412
FLEMING: Who you share a house with,
who you travel with,

965
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:26,955
who you share a trainer with.

966
00:44:27,123 --> 00:44:28,582
Obviously,
you have the same parents.

967
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:29,875
You have the same friends.

[cheers and appIause]

SERENA: Yeah, I get mad at Venus
when she wins against me.

970
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:38,216
It's so stupid, though.
I hate Iosing.

971
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:40,510
l hate losing
more than I Iike winning.

972
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:45,390
OFFICIAL: Venus, you and your sister
have brought so much excitement

973
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:48,810
and taIent to this game of tennis.

974
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:51,396
CLlNTON :
They changed the face of tennis.

975
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:55,108
They made it more interesting
to a wider swath of Americans.

976
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:57,235
I aIways want Serena to win,

977
00:44:57,403 --> 00:45:01,073
and so it's kind of strange,
because I'm the big sister.

978
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,366
I take care of Serena.

979
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,951
I make sure she has everything
even if l don't have anything.

980
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:06,828
[screams]

981
00:45:06,996 --> 00:45:09,039
One of the high points, actuaIIy,
of the careers of both women

982
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:10,415
and the WiIIiams famiIy in generaI

983
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:13,168
was when they got to the finaI
of the French Open in 2002.

984
00:45:13,336 --> 00:45:16,588
As it turned out,
it was the first victory for Serena

985
00:45:16,756 --> 00:45:18,465
in a Grand SIam over Venus.

986
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:22,010
MALE COMMENTATOR:
What a great point to end it.

987
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:26,139
And baby sis has finaIIy won.

988
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:27,849
MALE COMMENTATOR 2:
Where's Venus going, by the way?

989
00:45:28,017 --> 00:45:29,393
Seems to be getting a camera.

990
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:33,688
She wants something here.
It is a camera.

991
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,232
FEMALE COMMENTATOR:
To take a picture of her sister.

992
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,275
MALE COMMENTATOR:
To record the moment.

993
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:39,903
lt's possible
that at WimbIedon this year,

994
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:43,073
she couId overtake Venus
for number one in the worId.

995
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:44,366
KING:
I do think, subconsciousIy,

996
00:45:44,534 --> 00:45:47,577
that Venus is wiIIing
to give her the spotIight.

997
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:50,288
l always think Venus is going,
"Serena, I know you reaIIy need this.

998
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:51,957
"It's okay. Go for it."

MALE STADIUM ANNOUNCER:
Game, set, and match.

1000
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:59,297
MALE COMMENTATOR:
And Serena WiIIiams has defended

1001
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:00,799
her WimbIedon championship.

1002
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:03,260
Venus is a extreme protector.

1003
00:46:03,428 --> 00:46:04,970
Serena aIways had to win,

1004
00:46:05,138 --> 00:46:07,264
or she aIways
had to be the princess.

1005
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:10,434
Youngest chiId syndrome,
she has that reaIIy, reaIIy bad.

1006
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:13,979
Serena got the added advantage
of being the younger sister.

1007
00:46:14,856 --> 00:46:16,356
LittIe Iess pressure.

1008
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:17,691
I think it's been a IittIe harder

1009
00:46:17,859 --> 00:46:19,067
for Venus to have
to deal with that.

1010
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:23,864
I wouId say out of the eight finaIs,
that Serena's won six of them.

1011
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,949
I had a brother that pIayed
professional tennis,

1012
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:29,703
and something teIIs me
that I wouIdn't be as forgiving

1013
00:46:29,871 --> 00:46:31,246
or understanding or--

1014
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:33,415
cIapping. I see Venus cIapping.

1015
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:36,334
I guess it's the uItimate bIood
is thicker than water.

1016
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:38,879
l feel like l should take
Iessons from them more so

1017
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:42,716
than me trying to expIain away
how the heII they do that.

1018
00:46:42,884 --> 00:46:44,384
At the end of the day,
it says "Williams,"

1019
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:47,721
and if you Iose, maybe one day
someone will mistaken

1020
00:46:47,889 --> 00:46:49,556
for the other WiIIiams, whatever,

1021
00:46:49,724 --> 00:46:52,434

P.A. ANNOUNCER: Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

1023
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:02,152
May I have your attention pIease?

1024
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,863
We wiII shortIy be opening the gates.

1025
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:06,823
- Grunting?
- Yeah.

1026
00:47:13,748 --> 00:47:15,040
At Ieast one of your daughters

1027
00:47:15,208 --> 00:47:19,127
is one of the foremost proponents
of grunting.

1028
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:22,506
Do you think that's
reaIIy heIping her game or not?

1029
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:25,300
Let's see,
to grunt or not to grunt?

1030
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:27,135
That is the question.

1031
00:47:27,303 --> 00:47:30,263
And it seems to be
aII over on the British press

1032
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:32,057
and the British mind.

1033
00:47:32,225 --> 00:47:35,185
I beIieve in Ietting grunt
and Iet not grunt.

1034
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:38,605
Is it something that you taIk
about a Iot with them or not?

1035
00:47:39,774 --> 00:47:41,316
WeII...

1036
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:44,486
grunting has not been
the focus of our conversations.

1037
00:47:44,654 --> 00:47:47,155
Um, we more or Iess taIk
about technique

1038
00:47:47,323 --> 00:47:49,950
and how to move your feet
and things like that.

1039

FlLM NARRATOR: Althea Gibson
heIped to toppIe the IiIy-white tradition

1209
00:56:14,413 --> 00:56:16,456
in tennis by winning the NationaI

1210

in 1 957 and '58.

And Arthur Ashe wasn't--

1212
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:22,754
I mean, he paved the way in a way,

1213
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:25,173
but he certainly
wasn't abIe to sort of get the--

1214
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:29,761
maybe quite the same chance
as they have.

1215
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:31,304
Being bIack gives everybody a edge,
'cause you just--

1216
00:56:31,472 --> 00:56:34,307
Everything's harder,
so it's no different

1217
00:56:34,475 --> 00:56:37,018
than a guy wearing weights
around his ankIes

1218
00:56:37,186 --> 00:56:38,811
so he couId jump higher.

1219

BIack is just a weight on your skin.

When you reaIIy Iearn
how to maneuver it,

1221
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:48,071
you end up doing
things faster and more intense,

1222
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:50,156
and you appreciate things more,

1223
00:56:50,324 --> 00:56:52,575
'cause it was harder for you
to get them in the first pIace.

that the war is not over,

l guess that's all
I can get out right now.

1245
00:58:16,243 --> 00:58:17,660
It was their understanding

1246
00:58:17,828 --> 00:58:22,623
that it was
a mistaken identity situation,

1247
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:26,836
meaning there was someone eIse
in a white DenaIi

whom they were...

And because her car
was like this car,

1251
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:45,396
they thought it was that person

1252
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:48,024
riding through their neighborhood,
and how dare they?

1253
00:58:48,192 --> 00:58:50,443
So they shot the car up.

that she's as good

01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:04,995
and this has,
Iike, a square neckIine,

1649
01:17:05,162 --> 01:17:06,955
so it's very fIattering.

1650
01:17:07,123 --> 01:17:09,374
Yeah, so what we did,
it was this right here.

1651
01:17:09,542 --> 01:17:11,835
WeII, I think their styIe
is very independent

1652
01:17:12,003 --> 01:17:14,254
and quite rebellious,
and they're not interested

1653
01:17:14,422 --> 01:17:15,797
in Iooking Iike anybody eIse,

1654
01:17:15,965 --> 01:17:18,717
nor do they reaIIy care
what anybody eIse thinks.

1655
01:17:18,884 --> 01:17:19,926
The biggest chaIIenge for me

1656
01:17:20,094 --> 01:17:23,305
when l play is deciding
what coIor I'm going to wear.

1657
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:25,598
MALE COMMENTATOR:
Now, I'm no aficionado, Tracy,

1658
01:17:25,766 --> 01:17:26,766
you'II be reIieved to hear,

1659
01:17:26,934 --> 01:17:30,603
but l'm told that
that's a new range of naiI poIish,

1660
01:17:30,771 --> 01:17:35,191
and the purple is called
"Grape, Set, and Match."

1661
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:36,651
FEMALE COMMENTATOR:
Get a look at her dress.

1662
01:17:36,819 --> 01:17:38,361
FEMALE COMMENTATOR 2:
ApparentIy caIIed the WonderIand dress,

1663
01:17:38,529 --> 01:17:40,322
inspired by Alice In Wonderland.

1664
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:41,906
FEMALE COMMENTATOR 3:
What was worse, some say,

1665
01:17:42,074 --> 01:17:44,451
the fIesh-coIored shorts
she wore underneath,

1666
01:17:44,618 --> 01:17:47,412
and, yes, she is wearing shorts.

1667
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:49,372
WlNTOUR:
Tennis was very conservative,

1668
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:52,792
and I think it's thanks
to pIayers Iike Andre Agassi

1669
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,920
and Venus and Serena
that the whoIe Iook of tennis

1670
01:17:56,088 --> 01:17:57,422
has totaIIy changed.

1671
01:17:57,590 --> 01:18:00,342
You know, it's easy to wear
a pretty dress,

1672
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:02,886
and they're not interested in that,

1673
01:18:03,054 --> 01:18:07,432
and that's part of who they are
and why peopIe pay attention.

1674
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,351
Attention has to be paid to them.

1675
01:18:14,148 --> 01:18:15,565
VENUS:
I'm going to the doctor saying,

1676
01:18:15,733 --> 01:18:17,275
"l don't feel like
I'm getting enough air,"

1677
01:18:17,443 --> 01:18:20,153
or, "I just don't have
the stamina to Iast."

1678
01:18:20,321 --> 01:18:21,821
You know, l train
the same amount or more

1679
01:18:21,989 --> 01:18:24,324
than anyone eIse
with haIf the resuIt.

1680
01:18:27,411 --> 01:18:29,287
ASSISTANT:
Um, weII, she's actuaIIy gonna

1681
01:18:29,455 --> 01:18:32,582
have a match probabIy
in two to three hours,

1682
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:35,293
but she's saying
how she just woke up today

1683
01:18:35,461 --> 01:18:37,712
and she's feeIing reaIIy tired.

1684
01:18:39,465 --> 01:18:41,800
Is there anything
that you recommend?

1685
01:18:41,967 --> 01:18:44,719
VENUS: I was diagnosed
with Sjogren's this summer.

1686
01:18:44,887 --> 01:18:46,304
It's kind of hard to describe.

1687
01:18:46,472 --> 01:18:48,556
You know,
it's pretty much just, Iike,

1688
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:52,143
not having any energy at aII
and feeling like you're sick,

1689
01:18:52,311 --> 01:18:54,729
but you don't have a coId or a fIu.

1690
01:18:54,897 --> 01:18:57,357
ORACENE:

1691
01:19:01,904 --> 01:19:03,655
DOCTOR: How are you?
What's happening?

1692
01:19:03,823 --> 01:19:05,115
Um...

1693
01:19:08,786 --> 01:19:10,662
- Okay.
- So, um...

1694
01:19:13,207 --> 01:19:14,582
DOCTOR: Oh, okay.

1695
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,543
NURSE:

1696
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:21,673
VENUS: Well, this summer,
I started having more issues,

1697
01:19:21,841 --> 01:19:23,842
just not feeIing good,

1698
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:28,638
and my hand started swelling,
and I started having joint pain,

1699
01:19:28,806 --> 01:19:30,807
and I couIdn't controI my shots.

1700
01:19:30,975 --> 01:19:32,016
Like, I had no feeI Ieft.

1701
01:19:32,184 --> 01:19:34,477
Like, they were going out by feet.

1702
01:19:34,645 --> 01:19:37,313
So in a Iot of ways,
it's good that that happened, you know,

1703
01:19:37,481 --> 01:19:39,816
so that way I couId understand
what was wrong with me

1704
01:19:39,984 --> 01:19:42,318
and go on and get treatment.

1705
01:19:45,448 --> 01:19:46,823
ORACENE:

1706
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:58,501
And you have to be patient and...

1707
01:19:59,879 --> 01:20:01,421
Iet it work.

1708
01:20:01,589 --> 01:20:02,881
You can't rush it.

1709
01:20:08,345 --> 01:20:10,513
VENUS:

1710
01:20:10,681 --> 01:20:11,723
BRIAN WILLIAMS:
Back now as promised

1711
01:20:11,891 --> 01:20:13,683
with more
on this surprising announcement

1712
01:20:13,851 --> 01:20:17,020
by Venus WiIIiams,
a tennis superstar by any measure,

1713
01:20:17,188 --> 01:20:19,355
that she is out of the game,
at least for now,

1714
01:20:19,523 --> 01:20:22,609
puIIing out of the U.S. Open
to tend to her health.

1715
01:20:22,776 --> 01:20:25,778
MALE REPORTER: Serena, can you
give us an update on your sister,

1716
01:20:25,946 --> 01:20:27,822
what she's doing now
since she's withdrawn?

1717
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:29,491
SERENA:
She's stiII in New York,

1718
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:32,076
and she said she was gonna
hang out for a IittIe bit.

1719
01:20:32,244 --> 01:20:33,953
WOMAN :

1720
01:20:34,121 --> 01:20:35,663
Hey, how are you?

1721
01:20:37,917 --> 01:20:38,917
VENUS:
Thank you very much.

1722
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:42,795
Thank you.

1723
01:20:42,963 --> 01:20:44,255
It's a short Iife as a tennis pIayer.

1724
01:20:44,423 --> 01:20:45,590
I mean, they're extraordinary,

1725
01:20:45,758 --> 01:20:48,259
how Iong that they've remained
on the top of the game,

1726
01:20:48,427 --> 01:20:51,888
so I think aIong the way,
you reaIIy do need to find

1727
01:20:52,056 --> 01:20:54,140
what eIse interests you,
and if it's fashion

1728
01:20:54,308 --> 01:20:57,018
or acting or working in teIevision.

1729
01:20:57,186 --> 01:20:58,228
You're supposed
to be my man, Rasheed.

1730
01:20:58,395 --> 01:21:00,313
You were supposed to be there for me.
l needed you.

1731
01:21:00,481 --> 01:21:02,732
Great, but have that baIance.

1732
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:04,275
FEMALE REPORTER:
Now your sister has announced

1733
01:21:04,443 --> 01:21:07,111
that she's been diagnosed
with this autoimmune disorder.

1734
01:21:07,279 --> 01:21:08,696
SERENA: She's been struggIing
for a Iong time,

1735
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:11,282
and now she can actuaIIy get better.

1736
01:21:12,451 --> 01:21:15,203
I know. I shouId probabIy go
to the gym and eat,

1737
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:17,747
but I'm having a hard time
doing the things

1738
01:21:17,915 --> 01:21:19,832
I'm supposed to do nowadays.

1739
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:33,263
SERENA:
I feeI Iike my serve sucks.

1740
01:21:33,430 --> 01:21:36,683
My return,
I feeI Iike I'm missing so many shots.

1741
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:37,976
I just...

1742
01:21:38,978 --> 01:21:42,063
I mean, the onIy thing
I'm doing weII is, Iike--

1743
01:21:42,231 --> 01:21:43,773
Today I don't know.

1744
01:21:43,941 --> 01:21:45,692
But I expect so much from myseIf.

1745
01:21:46,777 --> 01:21:48,653
RICHARD: When she's practicing,
you look at her,

1746
01:21:48,821 --> 01:21:51,823
and if you didn't know her game,
you'd get disgusted.

1747
01:21:51,991 --> 01:21:55,660
But she pIay about 20 times
better than she practice.

1748
01:21:55,828 --> 01:21:59,163
FEMALE COMMENTATOR: Serena WiIIiams
is taking on Victoria Azarenka.

Come on.

1753

Serena, end this thing.

1754
01:22:23,105 --> 01:22:24,314

ORACENE:

1758
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:50,673
I was just hoping she can
get through this match.

1759
01:22:52,009 --> 01:22:54,010
And see it for herseIf, you know?

1760
01:22:54,178 --> 01:22:57,805
'Cause if the girI
had a IittIe bit more moxie...

1761
01:23:58,492 --> 01:23:59,575
I don't want you to sit here

1762
01:23:59,743 --> 01:24:00,910
and say I'm the onIy one
that needs improvement.

1763

You need to improve too.

1764
01:24:04,373 --> 01:24:06,582
See, I know I need to improve,

1765
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:08,876
but I'm just asking you
to do better as weII.

1766
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:10,253
That's it.
You don't have to sit here

1767

and yeII at me and be Iike,
you know...

What?

1769
01:24:18,011 --> 01:24:20,388
I know, but I'm being honest
with you too this time

1770
01:24:20,556 --> 01:24:21,723
and saying that I feIt

1771
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:23,349
that I pIayed good tennis
today out there--

1772
01:24:23,517 --> 01:24:24,517
And I say you didn't.

1773
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:29,188
And here I pIayed Iike shit.

1774

I couIdn't be more upset
with how I pIayed.

1775
01:24:35,779 --> 01:24:38,239
BAJlN : l know l'm not gonna
convince Serena in that moment

1776
01:24:38,407 --> 01:24:41,451
to have her saying,
"Okay, Sascha, you're right."

1777
01:24:41,618 --> 01:24:43,327
Like, she wouId never,
ever say that.

1778
01:24:43,495 --> 01:24:47,915
l told her many times, like,
that if she has stress buiIdup,

1779
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:51,127
you know, since I'm a guy,
I can take it.

1780
01:25:03,056 --> 01:25:04,682
SERENA:

1781

BAJIN : I made a dumb joke.

1784
01:25:10,189 --> 01:25:13,566
l made a joke and said
that I asked Ana Ivanovic

1785
01:25:13,734 --> 01:25:15,943
when is she finaIIy gonna hire me,

1786
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:17,737
and I wasn't being serious at aII.

1787
01:25:17,905 --> 01:25:20,406
You know, I mean, Serena shouId
know that I Iove her

1788
01:25:20,574 --> 01:25:22,325
and that I'm here for her.

1789

SERENA:
He reaIIy hurt my feeIings today.

1790
01:25:24,661 --> 01:25:27,121
Because he taIked about
another woman?

1791

No, because he toId her that--
when was she gonna hire him.

1792
01:25:32,419 --> 01:25:35,922

"When are you gonna
start hitting with me?"

would tell you that,

"Your pIayer's
going to a Grand SIam.

And what she said
on the changeover, in my mind,

1862
01:29:40,834 --> 01:29:42,168
was just totaIIy unprofessionaI
