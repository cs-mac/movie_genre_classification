00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:22,620
M. For Mischa.

00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,521
Come on, come on let's go

3
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,008
Castle Lecter,
Lithuania 1944.

4
00:01:37,595 --> 00:01:39,276
The bowl, Lothar.

00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:42,916
Hurry now. give me the bath-tub.

6
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:47,298
Hannibal, Mischa.
Where have you been?

7
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:49,115
Hurry now.

8
00:01:51,207 --> 00:01:54,505
Hannibal, come here.

9
00:02:02,045 --> 00:02:03,607
Come on.

10
00:02:03,608 --> 00:02:06,285
Darling, The cart is packed.

11
00:02:06,525 --> 00:02:08,207
Everything is ready.

12
00:02:15,779 --> 00:02:20,248
Colonel Timka says 
the fighting will be close to the roads.

13
00:02:20,249 --> 00:02:25,075
But will not last more than a few days.
We will be safe at the lodge.

14
00:02:25,076 --> 00:02:27,622
We are almost there.

15
00:02:35,774 --> 00:02:38,223
In you come.
- Messieur Batton.

16
00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:40,352
Ah, hand me the the bath-tub but.
- I take care of it.

17
00:02:40,353 --> 00:02:43,084
No No that's fine but let's hurry

18
00:02:43,085 --> 00:02:46,163
The cook will have finished packing
the kitchen by the time you get back

19
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:58,705
Hannibal give them here. 
Mamma's pearls.

20
00:03:05,836 --> 00:03:07,582
Pearls are for swine.

21
00:03:11,667 --> 00:03:13,348
Mischa, come.

22
00:03:40,992 --> 00:03:43,365
Shut up, shut up , the major is here.

23
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,122
You are a Jew.

24
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:53,127
How could l eat your cooking. Despose of him.

25
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:58,468
How do you deal with locals?
Beeing locals yourselves?

26
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:03,403
You say you want to be SS.
 Let's see you earn it.

27
00:04:05,883 --> 00:04:09,156
   Kill the Jew.
Bring me the peasant.

28
00:04:12,696 --> 00:04:14,378
Move move.

29
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:25,866
Are you a gypsy?
- No sir.

30
00:04:33,785 --> 00:04:35,467
Are you a Jew?

31
00:04:36,995 --> 00:04:38,676
No sir.

32
00:04:40,493 --> 00:04:42,175
Good job.

33
00:04:44,165 --> 00:04:46,230
Why don't you show us your dick?

34
00:04:48,907 --> 00:04:52,217
Major, Russian tanks
moving west.

35
00:04:52,218 --> 00:04:54,798
Put all their food on the truck, move it.

36
00:05:02,174 --> 00:05:03,855
What is that?

37
00:05:10,369 --> 00:05:13,584
A tank, a Russian tank.
- Get away from the window.

38
00:05:13,585 --> 00:05:15,296
Lothar, Russians.

39
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:28,217
Everybody out of the house

40
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,255
We only want water.

41
00:05:43,553 --> 00:05:46,058
The children can stay in the home

42
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:49,803
Get them inside.
- Mischa in here.

43
00:05:49,968 --> 00:05:51,650
Start the pump.

44
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:05,972
Wait here.

45
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,149
Mamma.

46
00:06:11,782 --> 00:06:13,425
How much longer with the pump

47
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,537
Stuka.

48
00:06:21,955 --> 00:06:23,699
Shoot shoot.

49
00:06:27,276 --> 00:06:28,958
Get down.

50
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,011
Pappa.

51
00:07:44,568 --> 00:07:48,247
No, no.    Mischa.

52
00:07:49,533 --> 00:07:51,349
Mischa, Mischa go back.

53
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,986
Go back Mischa!
- Mamma.

54
00:07:53,987 --> 00:07:55,835
No, Mischa go back.

55
00:08:09,676 --> 00:08:11,357
Come on Grentz.

56
00:08:12,194 --> 00:08:14,626
Kolnas, come on.

57
00:08:14,996 --> 00:08:16,352
Hurry.

58
00:08:21,453 --> 00:08:23,670
Come on.

59
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:25,504
Get into the truck

60
00:08:25,554 --> 00:08:27,236
Start your engine.

61
00:08:28,932 --> 00:08:30,939
Holy Christus, we're going to die.

62
00:08:31,168 --> 00:08:33,755
Relax. Well be fine.

63
00:08:38,877 --> 00:08:41,716
Isn't that the SS major?

64
00:08:44,931 --> 00:08:48,005
Major,  Kill a few gypsies you said.

65
00:08:48,901 --> 00:08:52,013
Kill a few Jews, and we make you SS.

66
00:08:52,547 --> 00:08:54,824
If you had kept your word…

67
00:08:54,837 --> 00:08:57,245
I would be saying yes sir to you now.

68
00:08:59,221 --> 00:09:02,830
But now, I am in business for myself.

69
00:09:11,404 --> 00:09:13,530
Russians.

70
00:09:18,804 --> 00:09:20,485
Go go go.

71
00:10:08,724 --> 00:10:10,926
They're shooting looters.

72
00:10:11,776 --> 00:10:13,826
Stop and black out.

73
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,943
Put it down.
- Drop it, now.

74
00:10:50,052 --> 00:10:51,733
Put it down…

75
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:53,631
Or we shoot her.

76
00:10:54,027 --> 00:10:56,684
Give me that.
- Get the radio Kolnas.

77
00:11:01,715 --> 00:11:03,396
Mamma.

78
00:11:08,024 --> 00:11:10,529
We are lucky. Only kids.

79
00:11:11,862 --> 00:11:14,519
If a patrol comes by…

80
00:11:14,745 --> 00:11:16,719
We saved them…

81
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,627
and their family stuff.

82
00:11:21,533 --> 00:11:24,712
Grentz, check the door.

83
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,172
Check upstairs.

84
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,122
Find some food.

85
00:11:33,072 --> 00:11:35,577
Only rotten potatoes.

86
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:59,670
It is information, you idiot.
This is no toy.

87
00:11:59,738 --> 00:12:03,230
Wait, l have found something 
on a Russian frequency.

88
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:12,144
Roadblocks

89
00:12:12,345 --> 00:12:15,609
Every five kilometer from here to Vilnius.

90
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:20,597
So, we're stuck for now.

91
00:12:39,163 --> 00:12:41,170
Did you get something?
- It's freezing out there.

92
00:12:41,871 --> 00:12:43,552
Open it.

93
00:12:45,543 --> 00:12:47,888
Do you think these are pepper corns?

94
00:12:48,289 --> 00:12:50,111
These are frozen maggots.

95
00:12:49,804 --> 00:12:52,461
This was rotten before it froze.

96
00:13:02,094 --> 00:13:04,984
I put this in your head.
- Stop it

97
00:13:22,975 --> 00:13:25,480
The boy is Hannibal Lecter…

98
00:13:28,321 --> 00:13:31,494
and the little girl is Mischa.

99
00:14:01,735 --> 00:14:04,900
We eat
or die.

100
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:35,334
Eight years later.

101
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,880
Let's hear you little master

102
00:15:05,665 --> 00:15:07,978
He is mute.
- He's not mute at night.

103
00:15:08,003 --> 00:15:11,540
He can screem well enough and he'll sing.

104
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:16,947
This is not your fathers house anymore.
It's the people's orphanage…

105
00:15:17,248 --> 00:15:19,450
and you're just one more orphan.

106
00:15:20,442 --> 00:15:22,242
Gunter

107
00:15:22,336 --> 00:15:24,471
I see you in my office.

108
00:15:34,712 --> 00:15:35,588
Hannibal

109
00:15:35,788 --> 00:15:41,369
You do not honour the human pecking order.
You're always hurting the bullies.

110
00:15:44,238 --> 00:15:48,133
I know.
This was your mothers room.

111
00:15:48,523 --> 00:15:51,787
It must be difficult for you
to live in this house.

112
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:56,042
Go to bed.

113
00:15:57,241 --> 00:15:59,241
Go To Bed

114
00:16:33,356 --> 00:16:34,406
Mischa

115
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,152
Get up.

116
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:46,430
Now screem all you please

117
00:16:53,436 --> 00:16:56,055
Everyday you'll pay for this.

118
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:59,448
Everyday for the rest 
of your short and nasty live

119
00:18:52,963 --> 00:18:54,644
Lecter.

120
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,919
SING

121
00:19:47,403 --> 00:19:51,109
Mr the earl Robert Lecter
Castle Vigo, Etampes, France.

122
00:20:49,072 --> 00:20:50,394
Who is there?

123
00:20:50,545 --> 00:20:52,924
Some help you are, Shoo, go.

124
00:20:57,822 --> 00:21:00,719
What is it Serge?
- A boy, Madame.

125
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,225
He has pictures of you and your husband.

126
00:21:37,695 --> 00:21:40,352
Your uncle would have
loved to see you again.

127
00:21:40,598 --> 00:21:44,165
It has been almost a year since he died.

128
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:56,260
Only you and l are left.

129
00:22:25,921 --> 00:22:27,921
Mischa, Mischa.

130
00:22:29,276 --> 00:22:31,526
Mischa, Mischa.
- Hannibal

131
00:22:32,503 --> 00:22:34,180
Mischa.
- Hannibal, Hannibal 

132
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:36,388
Hannibal, wake up

133
00:22:37,271 --> 00:22:39,416
It's alright, it's alright.

134
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:45,274
When you sleep, do you remember?

135
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,540
Do you remember what happened to Mischa?

136
00:23:14,088 --> 00:23:16,409
You look like your uncle Hannibal.

137
00:23:20,829 --> 00:23:22,468
Would you like to try?

138
00:23:22,826 --> 00:23:24,176
Use this

139
00:24:19,523 --> 00:24:21,204
Speak to me.

140
00:24:26,801 --> 00:24:28,540
Thank you.

141
00:25:27,168 --> 00:25:28,168
Hannibal.

142
00:25:40,136 --> 00:25:42,575
Here is where l pray to my ancestors,

143
00:25:42,665 --> 00:25:44,665
for strenght and courage

144
00:25:49,194 --> 00:25:53,901
I have the honor.
Only on my ancestors birthday…

145
00:25:54,041 --> 00:25:57,836
to polish his armour with oil of clove

146
00:26:12,763 --> 00:26:16,103
This is after the fight
for Osaka castle.

147
00:26:23,496 --> 00:26:27,595
The Samurai displayed the head of their enemies

148
00:26:27,973 --> 00:26:31,700
There are more suitable parchments,
that will interest you

149
00:26:34,581 --> 00:26:37,500
Be gentle Hannibal and be brave…

150
00:26:39,851 --> 00:26:41,331
Like your father

151
00:26:44,409 --> 00:26:45,690
And like him.

152
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,705
You must be ready for anything.

153
00:26:57,956 --> 00:26:58,838
Come.

154
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:04,340
Again.

155
00:27:07,975 --> 00:27:09,106
Again.

156
00:27:14,528 --> 00:27:16,860
Well. Again.

157
00:28:01,247 --> 00:28:02,928
Hé, Japonese.

158
00:28:03,835 --> 00:28:05,122
Hé, Japonese.

159
00:28:05,322 --> 00:28:07,175
Messieur please

160
00:28:08,923 --> 00:28:10,896
Is that it?
- Yes.

161
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,689
Hé, Japonese tell me the truth.…

162
00:28:14,889 --> 00:28:16,938
Does your pussy run crossways?

163
00:28:17,132 --> 00:28:19,713
Full of  straight hairs that will explode.

164
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,518
Hannibal

165
00:28:30,905 --> 00:28:32,305
Don't move

166
00:30:52,077 --> 00:30:56,024
If you pissed in my fueltank, 
l'll twist your head of.

167
00:30:56,182 --> 00:30:58,296
Paul Momund, the butcher.

168
00:31:00,429 --> 00:31:02,757
You owe a certain lady
 an apology.

169
00:31:02,807 --> 00:31:05,388
Apologise to la Japonese?

170
00:31:05,744 --> 00:31:09,118
Boy must be crazy to come here. 
I throw you in the river…

171
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:12,938
or maybe l slit your pants
and give you something you don't want,

172
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:14,436
where you don't want it.

173
00:31:14,576 --> 00:31:18,751
You inquired about her... pussy.

174
00:31:19,232 --> 00:31:22,184
You speculated it went, which way?

175
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,786
Jap pussy runs crossways.

176
00:31:24,987 --> 00:31:28,099
You should fuck the Jap
and see for yourself.

177
00:31:29,193 --> 00:31:31,154
Crossways like that?

178
00:31:44,272 --> 00:31:46,713
Or more tangential?

179
00:32:02,196 --> 00:32:05,093
You see how you now stains the air?

180
00:32:06,017 --> 00:32:08,377
I should add that to my drawing.

181
00:32:09,259 --> 00:32:10,890
Would you like to see it?

182
00:32:59,654 --> 00:33:01,336
Wait for me.

183
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:07,370
This here was done by a single blade.

184
00:33:07,428 --> 00:33:11,050
Ah inspector Popil, 
l am very happy you could come.

185
00:33:11,109 --> 00:33:13,324
You won't remember me but l was with the cause

186
00:33:13,367 --> 00:33:16,375
- You delivered the rait to Nuerenburg
l sat behind you

187
00:33:16,725 --> 00:33:19,242
I saw you bring the evidence

188
00:33:19,717 --> 00:33:21,690
It's an honor sir.

189
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:26,008
What do we have here?
- Paul Momund, or   most of it.

190
00:33:26,059 --> 00:33:29,138
You have his dossier.
- Yes.

191
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:34,184
Fat and ugly.
He shipped Jews for Marseille.

192
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:37,210
He fought recently.

193
00:33:37,211 --> 00:33:38,411
And often.

194
00:33:38,462 --> 00:33:41,679
Last saturdaynight a barfight.
He had many enemies.

195
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:45,175
A list please, his recent opponents

196
00:33:45,853 --> 00:33:49,532
You have done nothing to this body?
- No, no, no sir.

197
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:51,610
The chief specifficaly…
- The odour, it's eh …

198
00:33:52,157 --> 00:33:54,488
It's not of anything you use here?

199
00:33:54,489 --> 00:33:56,599
It smells like a toothpain remedy

200
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,823
Yes, oil of cloves.

201
00:33:59,349 --> 00:34:01,221
Let's see the pharmasist

202
00:34:03,549 --> 00:34:05,231
Look.

203
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:08,211
The most exquiset bits
of the fish are the cheeks

204
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,212
This is true for many creatures

205
00:34:11,213 --> 00:34:14,161
When carving at the table,
you one give cheek to madame…

206
00:34:14,312 --> 00:34:16,941
the other to the guest of honour.
- Did you hear?

207
00:34:17,042 --> 00:34:21,217
They haven't found that butcher's
damned ugly head yet.

208
00:35:43,017 --> 00:35:44,956
Good evening, milady.

209
00:35:50,464 --> 00:35:52,895
I hope you don't mind.

210
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:58,928
I would have used a butcher's-knife,
but the sword seems appropriate.

211
00:36:08,018 --> 00:36:11,510
Not a knick in the blade, l promise you

212
00:36:14,037 --> 00:36:15,859
The butcher was like butter.

213
00:36:39,012 --> 00:36:41,400
You didn't need to do this for me

214
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:44,474
Rudeness is epidemic, milady

215
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:52,721
Police.

216
00:36:57,777 --> 00:36:59,987
They will call it a murder.

217
00:37:00,864 --> 00:37:03,141
It was the crime of passion.

218
00:37:08,043 --> 00:37:11,102
Wash your hands, quickly.  Go.

219
00:37:14,887 --> 00:37:18,200
Inspector Popjil?
- Popil, Madame.

220
00:37:18,522 --> 00:37:19,822
Popil.

221
00:37:22,757 --> 00:37:24,389
Hannibal Lecter?

222
00:37:25,781 --> 00:37:27,462
Good evening.

223
00:37:27,427 --> 00:37:30,766
You fought with the butcher,
Paul Momund, in the market.

224
00:37:32,109 --> 00:37:33,790
Now he is dead.

225
00:37:34,564 --> 00:37:36,841
I must ask you to come along with me.

226
00:37:40,107 --> 00:37:41,859
Is your name Hannibal Lecter?

227
00:37:43,608 --> 00:37:45,290
Yes.

228
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:51,386
Do you have any guilty knowledge
of the death of Paul Momund?

229
00:37:52,349 --> 00:37:56,448
Guilty knowledge?
- Limit your responses to yes or no.

230
00:37:58,883 --> 00:38:00,165
No.

231
00:38:05,281 --> 00:38:09,389
It's funny la. 
He reacts to nothing.

232
00:38:12,454 --> 00:38:14,136
Monstrous.

233
00:38:18,758 --> 00:38:20,959
The butcher had been fishing.

234
00:38:21,463 --> 00:38:24,816
Blood and scales on his knife, 
but no fish.

235
00:38:24,817 --> 00:38:27,474
The tape tells you all that?

236
00:38:28,082 --> 00:38:29,413
Remarkable.

237
00:38:31,428 --> 00:38:32,760
No.

238
00:38:33,527 --> 00:38:37,398
The chef told me, 
you brought a splendid fish in for dinner.

239
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:41,497
Where did you get that fish?
- By fishing, inspector.

240
00:38:41,721 --> 00:38:45,066
We keep a baited line in the water
behind the boathouse

241
00:38:45,367 --> 00:38:47,713
I show you if you like.

242
00:38:47,875 --> 00:38:50,608
My speciality
is warcrimes.

243
00:38:51,147 --> 00:38:55,038
And I know 
they do not end with the war

244
00:38:55,139 --> 00:38:59,047
You lost your entire family.
So did I.

245
00:39:00,465 --> 00:39:04,412
For you your beautiful aunt came and… 
made up for it all.

246
00:39:04,954 --> 00:39:08,762
The very scent of her must have
taken away the smell of the camp

247
00:39:08,863 --> 00:39:12,355
So
when Paul the butcher spewed filth at her

248
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:15,430
I can understand if you killed him.

249
00:39:15,435 --> 00:39:18,091
Tell me what happened, Hannibal.

250
00:39:19,562 --> 00:39:20,662
Together we could show a court.

251
00:39:20,833 --> 00:39:24,983
The very scent of her
takes away the smell of the camp

252
00:39:26,504 --> 00:39:30,982
Do you compose verse inspector,
and keep it under your pillow?

253
00:39:50,677 --> 00:39:54,767
Now tell me inspector,
did you choose warcrimes

254
00:39:55,253 --> 00:39:58,768
because your lost family in the war?
- Yes.

255
00:39:59,581 --> 00:40:00,763
How?

256
00:40:02,509 --> 00:40:05,126
Some in combat, some were shipped east

257
00:40:05,227 --> 00:40:06,803
Did you catch who did it?

258
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:08,485
No.

259
00:40:09,251 --> 00:40:11,761
But they were Vichy, men like the butcher?

260
00:40:11,712 --> 00:40:13,093
Yes.

261
00:40:15,074 --> 00:40:17,306
Then we are both suspects.

262
00:40:17,997 --> 00:40:20,700
I can say you were fishing with me
if you like.

263
00:40:23,977 --> 00:40:26,281
Inspector, you must see this.

264
00:40:28,228 --> 00:40:30,652
I told you to keep these people away.

265
00:40:38,348 --> 00:40:40,146
Is that the butcher?
- Yes, Mr.

266
00:40:40,397 --> 00:40:43,235
How long?
- Ten minutes, no longer.

267
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:28,315
Father… mother…

268
00:41:30,435 --> 00:41:34,233
I am the youngest student
they've ever admitted into medical school.

269
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:41,129
It's a work scolarship.
I think you would be pleased.

270
00:41:41,893 --> 00:41:44,500
Heavy duties on my uncles estate

271
00:41:44,764 --> 00:41:47,795
have finally forced the sell of the chateau.

272
00:41:48,335 --> 00:41:51,748
Lady Murasaki will leave for Paris with me.

273
00:41:51,859 --> 00:41:54,936
The residency in France is 
now a doghouse.

274
00:41:55,537 --> 00:41:59,200
Medical institute Saint Marie - Paris.

275
00:41:59,437 --> 00:42:00,738
This work-scolarship 

276
00:42:02,038 --> 00:42:06,038
Means  l must spend much of my sparetime
preparing bodies for the anatomyclass

277
00:42:10,136 --> 00:42:14,339
My studies are fascinating 
and absorb me completely.

278
00:42:18,797 --> 00:42:21,985
Yet I still find myself
thinking about my sister

279
00:42:22,267 --> 00:42:24,274
and to the men who her from me.

280
00:42:24,317 --> 00:42:25,617
Hannibal.

281
00:42:30,167 --> 00:42:33,811
Do you suppose god intended to eat Isaac?

282
00:42:34,958 --> 00:42:37,994
That's why he told Abraham to kill him.

283
00:42:38,821 --> 00:42:41,514
Eat him? Of course not.

284
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:45,177
The angel intervenes in time.

285
00:42:47,779 --> 00:42:49,510
Not always.

286
00:42:55,951 --> 00:42:58,228
I have to know about Mischa.

287
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:03,928
I see their faces in my dreams…

288
00:43:04,128 --> 00:43:08,473
but l can't remember what they called 
each other with their blooded mouths.

289
00:43:10,294 --> 00:43:12,294
I would give anything to remember

290
00:43:16,576 --> 00:43:17,876
Hannibal,

291
00:43:18,659 --> 00:43:25,439
memory is a knife,
it hurts you.

292
00:43:46,074 --> 00:43:48,117
I want to stay here with you.

293
00:43:49,141 --> 00:43:51,570
No, you must stay at school.

294
00:44:12,224 --> 00:44:14,282
Louis I need you to remember

295
00:44:14,732 --> 00:44:18,387
Who told the nazis
where the children were hidden?

296
00:44:18,388 --> 00:44:20,697
You must remember.

297
00:44:22,136 --> 00:44:25,214
I can't bear to think about it

298
00:44:26,281 --> 00:44:28,300
This will help you remember.

299
00:44:30,017 --> 00:44:33,287
Hannibal Lecter.
What are you doing here?

300
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:37,768
The body,
I am a medical student now.

301
00:44:38,498 --> 00:44:41,546
Yes I know,
I have followed your progress.

302
00:44:41,746 --> 00:44:44,934
You repeat nothing you hear in this room.

303
00:44:47,436 --> 00:44:49,263
Please, Louis.

304
00:44:49,741 --> 00:44:52,231
Klaus Barbie shipped
the children to Auswitch.

305
00:44:52,431 --> 00:44:56,454
Who told him where the children where hidden?
Did you tell him?

306
00:44:58,602 --> 00:45:03,219
When they broke my fingers,
I gave them Pardou.

307
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:08,216
Pardou knew where
children were hidden.

308
00:45:12,158 --> 00:45:15,235
He's mayor of Belleville now.

309
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:19,855
Thank you, Louis.
- Inspector.

310
00:45:20,435 --> 00:45:23,993
Yes.
- Where were the police?

311
00:45:39,544 --> 00:45:43,390
No no no, no no no please please.

312
00:46:02,168 --> 00:46:04,130
You knew at-once what Louis wanted,
didn't you.

313
00:46:04,281 --> 00:46:08,225
His crucifix to remain with his brain,
not his heart.

314
00:46:08,426 --> 00:46:11,917
He answered your question,
but you didn't answer his.

315
00:46:12,766 --> 00:46:17,776
Where were the police when the nazis
threw the children into the trucks?

316
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:07,911
Come and play

317
00:48:09,705 --> 00:48:14,619
One little cheek, two little cheeks.

318
00:48:15,499 --> 00:48:16,780
Cough.

319
00:48:18,743 --> 00:48:20,565
She has pneumonia.

320
00:48:20,673 --> 00:48:22,354
Let's take her

321
00:48:23,173 --> 00:48:25,386
She's going to die anyway

322
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,300
Come on

323
00:48:56,445 --> 00:48:58,571
Get out.
- Grutas, wait.

324
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:01,928
the dogtags

325
00:49:04,334 --> 00:49:06,742
Potwatch,
Hurry

326
00:50:35,404 --> 00:50:37,808
Your tickets, please.

327
00:50:52,254 --> 00:50:57,640
Medininkai, Soviet border.

328
00:51:10,937 --> 00:51:12,619
Passport.

329
00:51:26,529 --> 00:51:28,261
Student?
- Yes.

330
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:34,129
You need a new photograph.

Kolnas.

00:55:30,338 --> 00:55:32,020
Grutas.

Castle Lecter,
Lithuania 1944.

341
00:57:18,755 --> 00:57:20,436

00:57:28,459 --> 00:57:30,275
Hurry now.

345
00:57:32,367 --> 00:57:35,665
Hannibal, come here.

346
00:57:43,205 --> 00:57:44,767
Come on.

347
00:57:44,768 --> 00:57:47,445
Darling, The cart is packed.

348
00:57:47,685 --> 00:57:49,367
Everything is ready.

349
00:57:56,939 --> 00:58:01,408
Colonel Timka says 
the fighting will be close to the roads.

350
00:58:01,409 --> 00:58:06,235
But will not last more than a few days.
We will be safe at the lodge.

351
00:58:06,236 --> 00:58:08,782
We are almost there.

352
00:58:16,934 --> 00:58:19,383
In you come.
- Messieur Batton.

353
00:58:19,429 --> 00:58:21,512
Ah, hand me the the bath-tub but.

354
00:58:21,513 --> 00:58:24,244
No No that's fine but let's hurry

355
00:58:24,245 --> 00:58:27,323
The cook will have finished packing
the kitchen by the time you get back

356
00:58:35,835 --> 00:58:39,865
Hannibal give them here. 
Mamma's pearls.

357
00:58:46,996 --> 00:58:48,742
Pearls are for swine.

358
00:58:52,827 --> 00:58:54,508
Mischa, come.

359
00:59:22,152 --> 00:59:24,525
Shut up, shut up , the major is here.

360
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,282
You are a Jew.

361
00:59:31,023 --> 00:59:34,287
How could l eat your cooking. Despose of him.

362
00:59:36,179 --> 00:59:39,628
How do you deal with locals?
Beeing locals yourselves?

363
00:59:39,629 --> 00:59:44,563
You say you want to be SS.
 Let's see you earn it.

364
00:59:47,043 --> 00:59:50,316
   Kill the Jew.
Bring me the peasant.

365
00:59:53,856 --> 00:59:55,538
Move move.

366
01:00:03,713 --> 01:00:07,026
Are you a gypsy?
- No sir.

367
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:16,627
Are you a Jew?

368
01:00:18,155 --> 01:00:19,836
No sir.

369
01:00:21,653 --> 01:00:23,335
Good job.

370
01:00:25,325 --> 01:00:27,390
Why don't you show us your dick?

371
01:00:30,067 --> 01:00:33,377
Major, Russian tanks
moving west.

372
01:00:33,378 --> 01:00:35,958
Put all their food on the truck, move it.

373
01:00:43,334 --> 01:00:45,015
What is that?

374
01:00:51,529 --> 01:00:54,744
A tank, a Russian tank.
- Get away from the window.

375
01:00:54,745 --> 01:00:56,456
Lothar, Russians.

376
01:01:07,499 --> 01:01:09,377
Everybody out of the house

377
01:01:22,290 --> 01:01:24,415
We only want water.

378
01:01:24,713 --> 01:01:27,218
The children can stay in the home

379
01:01:27,243 --> 01:01:30,963
Get them inside.
- Mischa in here.

380
01:01:31,128 --> 01:01:32,810
Start the pump.

381
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:47,132
Wait here.

382
01:01:48,627 --> 01:01:50,309
Mamma.

383
01:01:52,942 --> 01:01:54,585
How much longer with the pump

384
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:02,697
Stuka.

385
01:02:03,115 --> 01:02:04,859
Shoot shoot.

386
01:02:08,436 --> 01:02:10,118
Get down.

387
01:02:19,490 --> 01:02:21,171
Pappa.

388
01:03:25,728 --> 01:03:29,407
No, no.    Mischa.

389
01:03:30,693 --> 01:03:32,509
Mischa, Mischa go back.

390
01:03:33,590 --> 01:03:35,146
Go back Mischa!
- Mamma.

391
01:03:35,147 --> 01:03:36,995
No, Mischa go back.

392
01:03:50,836 --> 01:03:52,517
Come on Grentz.

393
01:03:53,354 --> 01:03:55,786
Kolnas, come on.

394
01:03:56,156 --> 01:03:57,512
Hurry.

395
01:04:02,613 --> 01:04:04,830
Come on.

396
01:04:04,864 --> 01:04:06,664
Get into the truck

397
01:04:06,714 --> 01:04:08,396
Start your engine.

398
01:04:10,092 --> 01:04:12,099
Holy Christus, we're going to die.

399
01:04:12,328 --> 01:04:14,915
Relax. Well be fine.

400
01:04:20,037 --> 01:04:22,876
Isn't that the SS major?

401
01:04:26,091 --> 01:04:29,165
Major,  Kill a few gypsies you said.

402
01:04:30,061 --> 01:04:33,173
Kill a few Jews, and we make you SS.

403
01:04:33,707 --> 01:04:35,984
If you had kept your word…

404
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:38,405
I would be saying yes sir to you now.

405
01:04:40,381 --> 01:04:43,990
But now, I am in business for myself.

406
01:04:52,564 --> 01:04:54,690
Russians.

407
01:04:59,964 --> 01:05:01,645
Go go go.

408
01:05:49,884 --> 01:05:52,086
They're shooting looters.

409
01:05:52,936 --> 01:05:54,986
Stop and black out.

410
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:31,103
Put it down.
- Drop it, now.

411
01:06:31,212 --> 01:06:32,893
Put it down…

412
01:06:33,045 --> 01:06:34,791
Or we shoot her.

413
01:06:35,187 --> 01:06:37,844
Give me that.
- Get the radio Kolnas.

414
01:06:42,875 --> 01:06:44,556
Mamma.

415
01:06:49,184 --> 01:06:51,689
We are lucky. Only kids.

416
01:06:53,022 --> 01:06:55,679
If a patrol comes by…

417
01:06:55,905 --> 01:06:57,879
We saved them…

418
01:06:59,504 --> 01:07:01,787
and their family stuff.

419
01:07:02,693 --> 01:07:05,872
Grentz, check the door.

420
01:07:06,650 --> 01:07:08,332
Check upstairs.

421
01:07:08,390 --> 01:07:10,282
Find some food.

422
01:07:14,232 --> 01:07:16,737
Only rotten potatoes.

423
01:07:37,110 --> 01:07:40,830
It is information, you idiot.
This is no toy.

424
01:07:40,898 --> 01:07:44,390
Wait, l have found something 
on a Russian frequency.

425
01:07:51,623 --> 01:07:53,304
Roadblocks

426
01:07:53,505 --> 01:07:56,769
Every five kilometer from here to Vilnius.

427
01:07:59,150 --> 01:08:01,757
So, we're stuck for now.

428
01:08:20,323 --> 01:08:22,330
Did you get something?
- It's freezing out there.

429
01:08:23,031 --> 01:08:24,712
Open it.

430
01:08:26,703 --> 01:08:29,048
Do you think these are pepper corns?

431
01:08:29,449 --> 01:08:31,271
These are frozen maggots.

432
01:08:30,964 --> 01:08:33,621
This was rotten before it froze.

433
01:08:43,254 --> 01:08:46,144
I put this in your head.
- Stop it

434
01:09:04,135 --> 01:09:06,640
The boy is Hannibal Lecter…

435
01:09:09,481 --> 01:09:12,654
and the little girl is Mischa.

436
01:09:42,895 --> 01:09:46,060
We eat
or die.

437
01:10:12,959 --> 01:10:16,494
Eight years later.

438
01:10:43,535 --> 01:10:46,040
Let's hear you little master

439
01:10:46,825 --> 01:10:49,138
He is mute.
- He's not mute at night.

440
01:10:49,163 --> 01:10:52,700
He can screem well enough and he'll sing.

441
01:10:53,201 --> 01:10:58,107
This is not your fathers house anymore.
It's the people's orphanage…

442
01:10:58,408 --> 01:11:00,610
and you're just one more orphan.

443
01:11:01,602 --> 01:11:03,402
Gunter

444
01:11:03,496 --> 01:11:05,631
I see you in my office.

445
01:11:15,872 --> 01:11:16,748
Hannibal

446
01:11:16,948 --> 01:11:22,529
You do not honour the human pecking order.
You're always hurting the bullies.

447
01:11:25,398 --> 01:11:29,293
I know.
This was your mothers room.

448
01:11:29,683 --> 01:11:32,947
It must be difficult for you
to live in this house.

449
01:11:35,364 --> 01:11:37,202
Go to bed.

450
01:11:38,401 --> 01:11:40,401
Go To Bed

451
01:12:14,516 --> 01:12:15,566
Mischa

452
01:12:17,630 --> 01:12:19,312
Get up.

453
01:12:25,010 --> 01:12:27,590
Now screem all you please

454
01:12:34,596 --> 01:12:37,215
Everyday you'll pay for this.

455
01:12:37,385 --> 01:12:40,608
Everyday for the rest 
of your short and nasty live

456
01:14:34,123 --> 01:14:35,804
Lecter.

457
01:14:44,150 --> 01:14:46,079
SING

458
01:15:28,563 --> 01:15:32,269
Mr the earl Robert Lecter
Castle Vigo, Etampes, France.

459
01:16:30,232 --> 01:16:31,554
Who is there?

460
01:16:31,705 --> 01:16:34,084
Some help you are, Shoo, go.

461
01:16:38,982 --> 01:16:41,879
What is it Serge?
- A boy, Madame.

462
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:44,385
He has pictures of you and your husband.

463
01:17:18,855 --> 01:17:21,512
Your uncle would have
loved to see you again.

464
01:17:21,758 --> 01:17:25,325
It has been almost a year since he died.

465
01:17:35,055 --> 01:17:37,420
Only you and l are left.

466
01:18:07,081 --> 01:18:09,081
Mischa, Mischa.

467
01:18:10,436 --> 01:18:12,686
Mischa, Mischa.
- Hannibal

468
01:18:13,663 --> 01:18:15,340
Mischa.
- Hannibal, Hannibal 

469
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:17,548
Hannibal, wake up

470
01:18:18,431 --> 01:18:20,576
It's alright, it's alright.

471
01:18:23,370 --> 01:18:26,434
When you sleep, do you remember?

472
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:31,700
Do you remember what happened to Mischa?

473
01:18:55,248 --> 01:18:57,569
You look like your uncle Hannibal.

474
01:19:01,989 --> 01:19:03,628
Would you like to try?

475
01:19:03,986 --> 01:19:05,336
Use this

476
01:20:00,683 --> 01:20:02,364
Speak to me.

477
01:20:07,961 --> 01:20:09,700
Thank you.

478
01:21:08,328 --> 01:21:09,328
Hannibal.

479
01:21:21,296 --> 01:21:23,735
Here is where l pray to my ancestors,

480
01:21:23,825 --> 01:21:25,825
for strenght and courage

481
01:21:30,354 --> 01:21:35,061
I have the honor.
Only on my ancestors birthday…

482
01:21:35,201 --> 01:21:38,996
to polish his armour with oil of clove

483
01:21:53,923 --> 01:21:57,263
This is after the fight
for Osaka castle.

484
01:22:04,656 --> 01:22:08,755
The Samurai displayed the head of their enemies

485
01:22:09,133 --> 01:22:12,860
There are more suitable parchments,
that will interest you

486
01:22:15,741 --> 01:22:18,660
Be gentle Hannibal and be brave…

487
01:22:21,011 --> 01:22:22,491
Like your father

488
01:22:25,569 --> 01:22:26,850
And like him.

489
01:22:36,990 --> 01:22:38,865
You must be ready for anything.

490
01:22:39,116 --> 01:22:39,998
Come.

491
01:22:44,368 --> 01:22:45,500
Again.

492
01:22:49,135 --> 01:22:50,266
Again.

493
01:22:55,688 --> 01:22:58,020
Well. Again.

494
01:23:42,407 --> 01:23:44,088
Hé, Japonese.

495
01:23:44,995 --> 01:23:46,282
Hé, Japonese.

496
01:23:46,482 --> 01:23:48,335
Messieur please

497
01:23:50,083 --> 01:23:52,056
Is that it?
- Yes.

498
01:23:54,090 --> 01:23:55,849
Hé, Japonese tell me the truth.…

499
01:23:56,049 --> 01:23:58,098
Does your pussy run crossways?

500
01:23:58,292 --> 01:24:00,873
Full of  straight hairs that will explode.

501
01:24:04,278 --> 01:24:05,678
Hannibal

502
01:24:12,065 --> 01:24:13,465
Don't move

503
01:26:33,237 --> 01:26:37,184
If you pissed in my fueltank, 
l'll twist your head of.

504
01:26:37,342 --> 01:26:39,456
Paul Momund, the butcher.

505
01:26:41,589 --> 01:26:43,917
You owe a certain lady
 an apology.

506
01:26:43,967 --> 01:26:46,548
Apologise to la Japonese?

507
01:26:46,904 --> 01:26:50,278
Boy must be crazy to come here. 
I throw you in the river…

508
01:26:50,579 --> 01:26:54,098
or maybe l slit your pants
and give you something you don't want,

509
01:26:54,398 --> 01:26:55,596
where you don't want it.

510
01:26:55,736 --> 01:26:59,911
You inquired about her... pussy.

511
01:27:00,392 --> 01:27:03,344
You speculated it went, which way?

512
01:27:03,990 --> 01:27:05,946
Jap pussy runs crossways.

513
01:27:06,147 --> 01:27:09,259
You should fuck the Jap
and see for yourself.

514
01:27:10,353 --> 01:27:12,314
Crossways like that?

515
01:27:25,432 --> 01:27:27,873
Or more tangential?

516
01:27:43,356 --> 01:27:46,253
You see how you now stains the air?

517
01:27:47,177 --> 01:27:49,537
I should add that to my drawing.

518
01:27:50,419 --> 01:27:52,050
Would you like to see it?

519
01:28:40,814 --> 01:28:42,496
Wait for me.

520
01:28:46,730 --> 01:28:48,530
This here was done by a single blade.

521
01:28:48,588 --> 01:28:52,210
Ah inspector Popil, 
l am very happy you could come.

522
01:28:52,269 --> 01:28:54,484
You won't remember me but l was with the cause

523
01:28:54,527 --> 01:28:57,535
- You delivered the rait to Nuerenburg
l sat behind you

524
01:28:57,885 --> 01:29:00,402
I saw you bring the evidence

525
01:29:00,877 --> 01:29:02,850
It's an honor sir.

526
01:29:03,627 --> 01:29:07,168
What do we have here?
- Paul Momund, or   most of it.

527
01:29:07,219 --> 01:29:10,298
You have his dossier.
- Yes.

528
01:29:11,199 --> 01:29:15,344
Fat and ugly.
He shipped Jews for Marseille.

529
01:29:16,650 --> 01:29:18,370
He fought recently.

530
01:29:18,371 --> 01:29:19,571
And often.

531
01:29:19,622 --> 01:29:22,839
Last saturdaynight a barfight.
He had many enemies.

532
01:29:23,190 --> 01:29:26,335
A list please, his recent opponents

533
01:29:27,013 --> 01:29:30,692
You have done nothing to this body?
- No, no, no sir.

534
01:29:30,493 --> 01:29:32,770
The chief specifficaly…
- The odour, it's eh …

535
01:29:33,317 --> 01:29:35,648
It's not of anything you use here?

536
01:29:35,649 --> 01:29:37,759
It smells like a toothpain remedy

537
01:29:38,236 --> 01:29:39,983
Yes, oil of cloves.

538
01:29:40,509 --> 01:29:42,381
Let's see the pharmasist

539
01:29:44,709 --> 01:29:46,391
Look.

540
01:29:46,479 --> 01:29:49,371
The most exquiset bits
of the fish are the cheeks

541
01:29:50,140 --> 01:29:52,372
This is true for many creatures

542
01:29:52,373 --> 01:29:55,321
When carving at the table,
you one give cheek to madame…

543
01:29:55,472 --> 01:29:58,101
the other to the guest of honour.
- Did you hear?

544
01:29:58,202 --> 01:30:02,377
They haven't found that butcher's
damned ugly head yet.

545
01:31:24,177 --> 01:31:26,116
Good evening, milady.

546
01:31:31,624 --> 01:31:34,055
I hope you don't mind.

547
01:31:34,319 --> 01:31:40,088
I would have used a butcher's-knife,
but the sword seems appropriate.

548
01:31:49,178 --> 01:31:52,670
Not a knick in the blade, l promise you

549
01:31:55,197 --> 01:31:57,019
The butcher was like butter.

550
01:32:20,172 --> 01:32:22,560
You didn't need to do this for me

551
01:32:22,750 --> 01:32:25,634
Rudeness is epidemic, milady

552
01:32:32,199 --> 01:32:33,881
Police.

553
01:32:38,937 --> 01:32:41,147
They will call it a murder.

554
01:32:42,024 --> 01:32:44,301
It was the crime of passion.

555
01:32:49,203 --> 01:32:52,262
Wash your hands, quickly.  Go.

556
01:32:56,047 --> 01:32:59,360
Inspector Popjil?
- Popil, Madame.

557
01:32:59,682 --> 01:33:00,982
Popil.

558
01:33:03,917 --> 01:33:05,549
Hannibal Lecter?

559
01:33:06,941 --> 01:33:08,622
Good evening.

560
01:33:08,587 --> 01:33:11,926
You fought with the butcher,
Paul Momund, in the market.

561
01:33:13,269 --> 01:33:14,950
Now he is dead.

562
01:33:15,724 --> 01:33:18,001
I must ask you to come along with me.

563
01:33:21,267 --> 01:33:23,019
Is your name Hannibal Lecter?

564
01:33:24,768 --> 01:33:26,450
Yes.

565
01:33:28,827 --> 01:33:32,546
Do you have any guilty knowledge
of the death of Paul Momund?

566
01:33:33,509 --> 01:33:37,608
Guilty knowledge?
- Limit your responses to yes or no.

567
01:33:40,043 --> 01:33:41,325
No.

568
01:33:46,441 --> 01:33:50,549
It's funny la. 
He reacts to nothing.

569
01:33:53,614 --> 01:33:55,296
Monstrous.

570
01:33:59,918 --> 01:34:02,119
The butcher had been fishing.

571
01:34:02,623 --> 01:34:05,976
Blood and scales on his knife, 
but no fish.

572
01:34:05,977 --> 01:34:08,634
The tape tells you all that?

573
01:34:09,242 --> 01:34:10,573
Remarkable.

574
01:34:12,588 --> 01:34:13,920
No.

575
01:34:14,687 --> 01:34:18,558
The chef told me, 
you brought a splendid fish in for dinner.

576
01:34:18,710 --> 01:34:22,657
Where did you get that fish?
- By fishing, inspector.

577
01:34:22,881 --> 01:34:26,226
We keep a baited line in the water
behind the boathouse

578
01:34:26,527 --> 01:34:28,873
I show you if you like.

579
01:34:29,035 --> 01:34:31,768
My speciality
is warcrimes.

580
01:34:32,307 --> 01:34:36,198
And I know 
they do not end with the war

581
01:34:36,299 --> 01:34:40,207
You lost your entire family.
So did I.

582
01:34:41,625 --> 01:34:45,572
For you your beautiful aunt came and… 
made up for it all.

583
01:34:46,114 --> 01:34:49,922
The very scent of her must have
taken away the smell of the camp

584
01:34:50,023 --> 01:34:53,515
So
when Paul the butcher spewed filth at her

585
01:34:53,630 --> 01:34:56,590
I can understand if you killed him.

586
01:34:56,595 --> 01:34:59,251
Tell me what happened, Hannibal.

587
01:35:00,722 --> 01:35:01,822
Together we could show a court.

588
01:35:01,993 --> 01:35:06,143
The very scent of her
takes away the smell of the camp

589
01:35:07,664 --> 01:35:12,142
Do you compose verse inspector,
and keep it under your pillow?

590
01:35:31,837 --> 01:35:35,927
Now tell me inspector,
did you choose warcrimes

591
01:35:36,413 --> 01:35:39,928
because your lost family in the war?
- Yes.

592
01:35:40,741 --> 01:35:41,923
How?

593
01:35:43,669 --> 01:35:46,286
Some in combat, some were shipped east

594
01:35:46,387 --> 01:35:47,963
Did you catch who did it?

595
01:35:48,264 --> 01:35:49,645
No.

596
01:35:50,411 --> 01:35:52,921
But they were Vichy, men like the butcher?

597
01:35:52,872 --> 01:35:54,253
Yes.

598
01:35:56,234 --> 01:35:58,466
Then we are both suspects.

599
01:35:59,157 --> 01:36:01,860
I can say you were fishing with me
if you like.

600
01:36:05,137 --> 01:36:07,441
Inspector, you must see this.

601
01:36:09,388 --> 01:36:11,812
I told you to keep these people away.

602
01:36:19,508 --> 01:36:21,306
Is that the butcher?
- Yes, Mr.

603
01:36:21,557 --> 01:36:24,395
How long?
- Ten minutes, no longer.

604
01:37:07,319 --> 01:37:09,475
Father… mother…

605
01:37:11,595 --> 01:37:15,393
I am the youngest student
they've ever admitted into medical school.

606
01:37:16,620 --> 01:37:22,289
It's a work scolarship.
I think you would be pleased.

607
01:37:23,053 --> 01:37:25,660
Heavy duties on my uncles estate

608
01:37:25,924 --> 01:37:28,955
have finally forced the sell of the chateau.

609
01:37:29,495 --> 01:37:32,908
Lady Murasaki will leave for Paris with me.

610
01:37:33,019 --> 01:37:36,096
The residency in France is 
now a doghouse.

611
01:37:36,697 --> 01:37:40,360
Medical institute Saint Marie - Paris.

612
01:37:40,597 --> 01:37:41,898
This work-scolarship 

613
01:37:43,198 --> 01:37:47,198
Means  l must spend much of my sparetime
preparing bodies for the anatomyclass

614
01:37:51,296 --> 01:37:55,499
My studies are fascinating 
and absorb me completely.

615
01:37:59,957 --> 01:38:03,145
Yet I still find myself
thinking about my sister

616
01:38:03,427 --> 01:38:05,434
and to the men who her from me.

617
01:38:05,477 --> 01:38:06,777
Hannibal.

618
01:38:11,327 --> 01:38:14,971
Do you suppose god intended to eat Isaac?

619
01:38:16,118 --> 01:38:19,154
That's why he told Abraham to kill him.

620
01:38:19,981 --> 01:38:22,674
Eat him? Of course not.

621
01:38:23,453 --> 01:38:26,337
The angel intervenes in time.

622
01:38:28,939 --> 01:38:30,670
Not always.

623
01:38:37,111 --> 01:38:39,388
I have to know about Mischa.

624
01:38:43,290 --> 01:38:45,088
I see their faces in my dreams…

625
01:38:45,288 --> 01:38:49,633
but l can't remember what they called 
each other with their blooded mouths.

626
01:38:51,454 --> 01:38:53,454
I would give anything to remember

627
01:38:57,736 --> 01:38:59,036
Hannibal,

628
01:38:59,819 --> 01:39:06,599
memory is a knife,
it hurts you.

629
01:39:27,234 --> 01:39:29,277
I want to stay here with you.

630
01:39:30,301 --> 01:39:32,730
No, you must stay at school.

631
01:39:53,384 --> 01:39:55,442
Louis I need you to remember

632
01:39:55,892 --> 01:39:59,547
Who told the nazis
where the children were hidden?

633
01:39:59,548 --> 01:40:01,857
You must remember.

634
01:40:03,296 --> 01:40:06,374
I can't bear to think about it

635
01:40:07,441 --> 01:40:09,460
This will help you remember.

636
01:40:11,177 --> 01:40:14,447
Hannibal Lecter.
What are you doing here?

637
01:40:15,610 --> 01:40:18,928
The body,
I am a medical student now.

638
01:40:19,658 --> 01:40:22,706
Yes I know,
I have followed your progress.

639
01:40:22,906 --> 01:40:26,094
You repeat nothing you hear in this room.

640
01:40:28,596 --> 01:40:30,423
Please, Louis.

641
01:40:30,901 --> 01:40:33,391
Klaus Barbie shipped
the children to Auswitch.

642
01:40:33,591 --> 01:40:37,614
Who told him where the children where hidden?
Did you tell him?

643
01:40:39,762 --> 01:40:44,379
When they broke my fingers,
I gave them Pardou.

644
01:40:46,300 --> 01:40:49,376
Pardou knew where
children were hidden.

645
01:40:53,318 --> 01:40:56,395
He's mayor of Belleville now.

646
01:40:58,890 --> 01:41:01,015
Thank you, Louis.
- Inspector.

647
01:41:01,595 --> 01:41:05,153
Yes.
- Where were the police?

648
01:41:20,704 --> 01:41:24,550
No no no, no no no please please.

649
01:41:43,328 --> 01:41:45,290
You knew at-once what Louis wanted,
didn't you.

650
01:41:45,441 --> 01:41:49,385
His crucifix to remain with his brain,
not his heart.

651
01:41:49,586 --> 01:41:53,077
He answered your question,
but you didn't answer his.

652
01:41:53,926 --> 01:41:58,936
Where were the police when the nazis
threw the children into the trucks?

653
01:43:47,390 --> 01:43:49,071
Come and play

654
01:43:50,865 --> 01:43:55,779
One little cheek, two little cheeks.

655
01:43:56,659 --> 01:43:57,940
Cough.

656
01:43:59,903 --> 01:44:01,725
She has pneumonia.

657
01:44:01,833 --> 01:44:03,514
Let's take her

658
01:44:04,333 --> 01:44:06,546
