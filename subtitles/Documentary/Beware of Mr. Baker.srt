But it made no difference.

181
00:09:44,901 --> 00:09:48,672
She just said,
"Look, if ever I find you

182
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:50,807
"Doing something
dishonest like this,

183
00:09:50,807 --> 00:09:53,209
I will call the police."

184
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:57,047
So I wouldn't talk to the gang
anymore,

185
00:09:57,047 --> 00:10:00,551
And I got beaten up
several times by them.

186
00:10:00,551 --> 00:10:05,689
Started carving me up with a
razor blade with tape around it.

187
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:08,825
They carved all these lines
all over my arms

188
00:10:08,825 --> 00:10:11,962
And my face and everything.

189
00:10:11,962 --> 00:10:14,698
I wasn't very popular
when I went back to school.

190
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:21,838
It was about this time that I'd
got the letter from my dad.

191
00:10:21,838 --> 00:10:26,843
He wrote a letter for me
to be opened when I was 14.

192
00:10:26,843 --> 00:10:29,980
"My dear son,
it's just a little advice

193
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:33,449
"In the way I should like you
to turn out.

199
00:10:45,461 --> 00:10:49,933
Before that, if people used to
punch me and that,

200
00:10:49,933 --> 00:10:53,469
I just used to cry and think,
"Why are they hitting me?"

201
00:10:53,469 --> 00:10:55,371
I wouldn't retaliate.

202
00:10:55,371 --> 00:10:57,941

208
00:11:13,657 --> 00:11:18,228
I was drumming all the time,
as long as I can remember.

209
00:11:18,228 --> 00:11:22,032
I was always banging
on the desks in school,

210
00:11:22,032 --> 00:11:26,102
And they were all just boogieing
and dancing and going crazy.

211
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:29,205
There was a party,
and they had a band there.

212

kept saying, "Go on."

Go and play the drums."

214
00:11:34,811 --> 00:11:38,314
And I just sat down,
and I could play.

215
00:11:38,314 --> 00:11:42,018
That's when a light went off...
I went "Fuck, I'm a drummer."

You've either got it
or you haven't.

220
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,998

His drumbeat is so personal
that I always know if it's him.

226
00:12:18,288 --> 00:12:21,091
I started doing quite well,
I guess.

227
00:12:21,091 --> 00:12:26,029
I'd got a sort of reputation
as a jazz drummer.

228
00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:27,798
My boyfriend at the time said,

00:12:27,798 --> 00:12:29,900
"Oh, you want to hear
this drummer.

And a good body, obviously.

233

He's always been insecure
deep down.

234
00:12:42,445 --> 00:12:47,851
And I think Ginger did search
for a father figure,

235
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:50,620
But they were always a drummer.

236
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:55,458
One night, I was playing
the all-nighter in the Flamingo,

237
00:12:55,458 --> 00:13:00,030
And I'd got offstage
to be confronted by God.

238
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:13,043
Phil was just
the most amazing drummer.

239

He was the only drummer
at that time

240
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:19,215
That brought tears to my eyes.

241
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:23,920
He said, "You're the first
fucking drummer I've heard here."

242

So we go down
into his basement flat,

244

And that is when I got
introduced to heroin

around his arm

And told me,
"When I tell you, undo it."

just a mass of scars

And tracks and stuff.

250
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:50,313
And he managed to hit a vein,

251
00:13:50,313 --> 00:13:53,516
And I pulled the thing off,
and he shot up.

252
00:13:54,484 --> 00:13:58,388
Then he gets out
all these African records

253

And I'm doing like a three beat
on it.

And he said,
"No, no, no. Listen."

And he played this four,
the real beat,

going on it.

it would improve his playing.

Alexis, watch it, 'cause he'll
steal half the band,"

354
00:19:13,136 --> 00:19:14,637
Which is exactly what he did.

355
00:19:14,637 --> 00:19:17,607
Can you contextualize who we're
speaking about right now?

356
00:19:17,607 --> 00:19:20,343
Well, I've just said it,
for fuck's sake.

357
00:19:20,343 --> 00:19:21,811
You just said "Graham."
That's it.

358
00:19:21,811 --> 00:19:24,447
People who don't know
who Graham is.

359
00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:28,451
Graham Bond was a fat guy.

the corner, waiting to go home *

363

a doss across the street *

364
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:43,999

Oh!

367
00:19:46,569 --> 00:19:49,805
Graham Bond Organization
was to musicians

368
00:19:49,805 --> 00:19:52,074
What The Beatles were
to the public.

369
00:19:52,074 --> 00:19:53,809
Brilliant.

370
00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:56,412
Jack Bruce, Ginger Baker,
Dick Heckstall-Smith,

371
00:19:56,412 --> 00:19:58,514
And Graham Bond were at the top.

372
00:19:58,514 --> 00:20:02,152
We were a band trying to be
like a band in Chicago.

373
00:20:02,152 --> 00:20:04,086
But they were something else,
you know?

374
00:20:04,086 --> 00:20:06,156
* Playin' with an R&B band *

375
00:20:06,156 --> 00:20:07,423
* Oh, yeah! *

376
00:20:07,423 --> 00:20:09,559
His reputation was as being,
you know,

377
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:12,328
Probably the best drummer around
in those days.

378
00:20:12,328 --> 00:20:15,465
It was really Ginger's
first taste of fame, yes.

379
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:18,000
It's the same with you, Ginger.

380
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,302
This is beat.

381
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:20,570
[Beats drum]

382
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:23,873
Don't worry about
splitting your skins.

383
00:20:23,873 --> 00:20:26,809
They can be replaced.

384
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:28,744
And so can you.

385
00:20:28,744 --> 00:20:32,648
They did sort of contain the
seeds of their own destruction,

386
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,418
What with Graham
and Ginger's bad habits

387
00:20:35,418 --> 00:20:38,221
And the conflict
between Jack and Ginger.

388
00:20:38,221 --> 00:20:39,689
For two musicians

389
00:20:39,689 --> 00:20:42,492
Who were incredibly
complementary to each other

390
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:45,027
And who have played
consistently over the years,

391
00:20:45,027 --> 00:20:50,733
It's really remarkable
how well they didn't get along.

392
00:20:50,733 --> 00:20:54,036
It was a very sad
situation, really.

393
00:20:54,036 --> 00:20:58,208
In the early days,
when he was following me more,

394
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,710
The music was
really fucking great.

395
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:04,580
When I switched from
upright bass to bass guitar,

396
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,849
That wasn't what Ginger wanted.

397
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:10,085
I think that was when
the problems started.

398
00:21:10,085 --> 00:21:14,190
Jack's like a guy who gets up
before the sun comes

399
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,459
To see the sun rise.

400
00:21:16,459 --> 00:21:19,729
He sees the sun come
halfway over the horizon

401
00:21:19,729 --> 00:21:23,333
And runs home and says,
"I've seen the sun rise."

402
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:28,871
That was how Jack
got the time things

403
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:31,040
That I was showing him.

404
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,743
He didn't get the full picture.

405
00:21:33,743 --> 00:21:37,547
I have perfect time, which is
a quite useful thing to have.

406
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:39,882
Very few people have that.

407
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:41,317
It's just a gift.

408
00:21:41,317 --> 00:21:44,920
The last number
was always the drum solo.

409
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,557
And I've kicked into
the drum solo,

410
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:50,493
And Jack's, like,
playing with me.

411
00:21:50,493 --> 00:21:53,796
I wouldn't be playing
during his drum solo.

412
00:21:53,796 --> 00:21:57,900
And I off-loaded
a right-hander on him.

413
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,504
He went down on the ground,
and I'm kicking him.

414
00:22:01,504 --> 00:22:04,340
You know,
"Get up, you little cunt!"

415
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,809
I was kicking the shit
out of him.

416
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:08,678
[Drum solo]

417
00:22:08,678 --> 00:22:13,816
I just let go, and I was gonna
kick him to death.

418
00:22:13,816 --> 00:22:17,219
And then he pulled a knife
on me and said, "You're fired."

419
00:22:17,219 --> 00:22:18,788
And I said,
"But you can't fire me.

420
00:22:18,788 --> 00:22:21,090
"It's The Graham Bond
Organization,

421
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,592
And I'm the founding member."

422
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:23,893
But poor old Graham...

423
00:22:23,893 --> 00:22:26,262
He was well gone
into smack by that time,

424
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:27,930
So he didn't really care.

425
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:32,067
Graham was probably a bigger
disaster area than Ginger was.

426
00:22:32,067 --> 00:22:35,271
We would be using a mixture
of cocaine, heroin,

427
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:37,840
And lysergic acid in a fix.

428
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,008
[Laughs]

429
00:22:39,008 --> 00:22:43,346
I was very hurt
by not the knife thing,

430
00:22:43,346 --> 00:22:47,182
But the fact that I was out
of that band.

431
00:22:47,182 --> 00:22:51,721
And it was very stupid of him,
because the band was doing well,

432
00:22:51,721 --> 00:22:55,024
And I was quite an important
part of the band.

433
00:22:55,024 --> 00:22:58,794
The band continued
being very successful

434
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:01,931
And just reached a point
where I thought,

435
00:23:01,931 --> 00:23:06,536
"I've been running the band
successfully for three years.

436
00:23:06,536 --> 00:23:10,573
Why don't I run my own band
instead?"

437

[Cream's "White Room" plays]

438
00:23:22,385 --> 00:23:27,156
The first person I thought of
was Eric.

[Guitar solo]

440
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:38,434
He saw something in me
that I never saw before.

441
00:23:38,434 --> 00:23:40,436
He would say it was about time.

442
00:23:40,436 --> 00:23:43,873
He had time
that very few people have.

443
00:23:43,873 --> 00:23:45,074
Eric had it.

444
00:23:45,074 --> 00:23:48,678
Ginger was pretty dismissive
and antisocial...

445
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:50,413
Seriously antisocial.

446
00:23:50,413 --> 00:23:52,415
But he had the gift.

447
00:23:52,415 --> 00:23:55,685
He had the spark, the flair,
the panache.

448
00:23:55,685 --> 00:23:57,387
He had it in spades.

449
00:23:57,387 --> 00:23:59,489
And Jack had the same thing.

450
00:23:59,489 --> 00:24:02,958
He said, "What about Jack
as the bass player?"

451
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:06,228
And all the red lights
in the world went off,

452
00:24:06,228 --> 00:24:08,263
And I thought, "Oh, God."

453
00:24:08,263 --> 00:24:11,934
I was very surprised
when he came knocking again.

454
00:24:11,934 --> 00:24:13,969
I didn't see that coming.
No.

455
00:24:13,969 --> 00:24:15,505
I didn't expect that, no.

really represented,

It overwhelmed everything.

["Tales of Brave Ulysses"
plays]

468
00:25:01,951 --> 00:25:06,221
When Hendrix came to England,
he wanted to jam with Cream,

469
00:25:06,221 --> 00:25:09,091
Because there was nobody else
that he admired as much.

470
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:12,361
They were the beginning
of many, many things.

471
00:25:12,361 --> 00:25:13,663
Cream absolutely
might be called

The first progressive band.

473
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,499
The first supergroup.

in big arenas.

That's how we called ourselves
Cream.

479

We knew we were the three
best musicians around.

480
00:25:38,854 --> 00:25:40,990
If Cream did not invent
heavy metal,

481
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:43,926
They certainly were part
of a band of brothers

482
00:25:43,926 --> 00:25:46,929
That were very instrumental
in facilitating it.

483
00:25:46,929 --> 00:25:52,134
The birth of heavy metal
should have been aborted.

["Sunshine of Your Love"

487
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,916
It's hard to find fault
with the notion

00:26:06,916 --> 00:26:08,951
That he was the pioneer
of a rock drummer.

489
00:26:08,951 --> 00:26:12,221
There was no context for him.
There was no archetype.

490
00:26:12,221 --> 00:26:13,623
He is the archetype.

491
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:15,491
Before Ginger, rhythm was

When he was listening to music
as a kid,

00:26:51,927 --> 00:26:53,796
He wasn't listening
to the Jimi Hendrix

502
00:26:53,796 --> 00:26:55,965
And guitar-hero bands and so on.

503
00:26:55,965 --> 00:26:57,499
He invented all that stuff.

That's where Jack's head is
writing.

"I wrote it in 5/4."

The guy who gets the credit
for writing the song

525
00:28:02,231 --> 00:28:04,767
Is the guy who writes the lyric
gets half of it,

526
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:06,869
And the guy who writes
the melody of the lyric

527
00:28:06,869 --> 00:28:08,170
Gets the other half.

528
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:10,973
The drums are part
of the arrangement,

529
00:28:10,973 --> 00:28:13,175
And the arrangement
doesn't get royalties.

530
00:28:13,175 --> 00:28:14,176
Zip. Nada.

531
00:28:14,176 --> 00:28:16,245
Cream was my thing.

532
00:28:16,245 --> 00:28:19,281
And it did exactly
what I planned it to do.

533
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:22,517
Only I'm the guy
who lost out on it.

534
00:28:22,517 --> 00:28:24,687
I'm fucking broke right now.

[Crowd cheering]

537
00:28:39,034 --> 00:28:41,603
To Jack Bruce's counterpoint,
he gives rhythm,

538
00:28:41,603 --> 00:28:44,707
And to Eric Clapton's technical
virtuosity, he gives shape.

539
00:28:44,707 --> 00:28:47,409
On their first tour together,
he practiced so intensively

540
00:28:47,409 --> 00:28:49,879
That he left behind him
a trail of hotel bills

541
00:28:49,879 --> 00:28:51,246
For broken furniture.

542
00:28:51,246 --> 00:28:53,415
We asked him
if he still practiced as much.

543
00:28:53,415 --> 00:28:56,618
No.
I don't practice at all.

544
00:28:56,618 --> 00:28:58,120
Not at all?

545
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,955
I used to, but I don't anymore.

546
00:28:59,955 --> 00:29:02,324
I just used to play solos.

547
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:06,829
Just used to sit on the drum kit
and play it all day.

548
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:08,030
Can you show us some?

549
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:10,332
- You want me to play?
- Please.

550
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:13,402
[Chuckles]
At this time of the day.

551
00:29:26,949 --> 00:29:31,887
Independence... the ability
to play a different thing

552
00:29:31,887 --> 00:29:34,023
With all four limbs,

553
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:37,292
Which is how I play things
that sound incredibly fast

554
00:29:37,292 --> 00:29:40,562
When I'm not actually moving
anything very fast.

555
00:29:40,562 --> 00:29:43,699
Because all four beats are
landing in a different place,

556
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:46,601
So what comes out
is four times as fast.

557
00:29:46,601 --> 00:29:48,003
[Laughs]

558
00:29:48,003 --> 00:29:51,640
But it's not how fast you play.

559
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,776
It's what you say.

[Drum solo]

561
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:03,986
Ginger Baker's
most notable achievement

562
00:30:03,986 --> 00:30:06,789
That should be recognized
is the first rock drum solo.

563
00:30:06,789 --> 00:30:08,758
And me as a 15-year-old kid
at the time

564
00:30:08,758 --> 00:30:11,593
Was like, "Yeah, yeah, that's
the rock drummer I want to be."

565
00:30:11,593 --> 00:30:12,795
I must have been 16.

566
00:30:12,795 --> 00:30:14,396
I was exactly the sweet spot

567
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:17,733
Where my brain clicked on
and said, "What's it all about?"

568
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:18,968
It was Ginger's drums.

569
00:30:18,968 --> 00:30:21,003
I'm here today
because of Ginger,

570
00:30:21,003 --> 00:30:23,839
Because he was
the absolute inspiration

571
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:26,641
For me being in a band,
playing the drums.

572
00:30:26,641 --> 00:30:30,412
I absolutely thought, "You know,
that's what I'd like to be."

573
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:36,752
[Music continues]

574
00:30:39,688 --> 00:30:41,123
It became Ginger's thing.

575
00:30:41,123 --> 00:30:43,458
He'd do these very long
drum solos.

576
00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:45,961
You either liked them
or you didn't like them.

577
00:30:45,961 --> 00:30:49,598
I liked them because I could go
off and have a smoke, you know?

578
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:51,533
Cream... How popular were they?

579
00:30:51,533 --> 00:30:52,835
Oh, huge, huge.

580
00:30:52,835 --> 00:30:54,336
How huge is "huge"?

581
00:30:54,336 --> 00:30:57,006
Well, they did three nights
in Madison Square Garden.

582
00:30:57,006 --> 00:31:00,109
They could have done two weeks
and sold out every night.

583
00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:02,444
When a promoter hired
The Cream,

584
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:05,881
Ginger wanted a case of beer
and two black hookers

585
00:31:05,881 --> 00:31:08,517
And a white limo
or he wouldn't play.

586
00:31:08,517 --> 00:31:09,751
I've been in hotel rooms,

587
00:31:09,751 --> 00:31:11,420
And there's been a knock on
the door.

588
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,754
I've opened the door,

589
00:31:12,754 --> 00:31:15,290
And there's been three groupies
all standing there.

590
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,626
Just queues of chicks waiting.
[Laughs]

591
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:20,462
One would knock on the door
and climb into bed.

592
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:22,998
We used to call them
"star fuckers."

593
00:31:22,998 --> 00:31:24,666
You know, they'd come
and say like,

594
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:27,369
"I'd like to give you a blowjob
and see you come."

595
00:31:27,369 --> 00:31:31,406
They all wanted to fuck Cream,
you know?

596
00:31:31,406 --> 00:31:35,010
It was quite a rapid rise
to fame.

597
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:38,547
I don't know whether it was
too fast for Ginger.

598
00:31:38,547 --> 00:31:39,982
I didn't really care.

599
00:31:39,982 --> 00:31:43,752
We'd lived in a succession
of not very nice places.

600
00:31:43,752 --> 00:31:45,087
And then for once, we thought,

601
00:31:45,087 --> 00:31:48,457
"Oh, we can actually buy
a house of our own."

602
00:31:48,457 --> 00:31:51,894
The family at home
was something totally separate

603
00:31:51,894 --> 00:31:54,229
From being on tour.

604
00:31:54,229 --> 00:31:57,232
His dad died when he was 4
or something like that.

605
00:31:57,232 --> 00:32:01,736
So he didn't really have
someone, a role-model father.

606
00:32:01,736 --> 00:32:07,176
He communicates more through his
drums than through his words.

607
00:32:07,176 --> 00:32:11,113
I told my wife
long before we were married,

608
00:32:11,113 --> 00:32:15,317
"If you get me to choose
between the drums and you,

609
00:32:15,317 --> 00:32:17,419
I'm gonna choose the drums."

610

611
00:32:18,954 --> 00:32:21,090
We had no other interest.

612
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:23,192
There was nothing else going on.

613
00:32:23,192 --> 00:32:24,860
There was no family.

614
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,396
There was no desires
for success.

615
00:32:27,396 --> 00:32:30,265
There was no commerciality
involved.

616
00:32:30,265 --> 00:32:31,901
There was no responsibility

617
00:32:31,901 --> 00:32:36,071
Other than to that unique moment
in time when we were together.

618
00:32:36,071 --> 00:32:38,540
And for a short,
sweet period of time,

619
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:42,611
It was unfettered and extreme
and beautiful.

620
00:32:42,611 --> 00:32:43,879
They were like Vikings.

621
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:45,547
You know, they just came
on our shore

622
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:48,450
And just took the women
and the children,

623
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:51,253
It was scorched earth.
There was no question about it.

624
00:32:51,253 --> 00:32:53,288
They were here to take heads.

625
00:32:53,288 --> 00:32:57,592
We went there to show the Yanks
how to play.

626
00:32:57,592 --> 00:32:59,528
I saw them when they first came
to San Francisco.

627
00:32:59,528 --> 00:33:03,698
They looked and sounded
like giants.

628
00:33:03,698 --> 00:33:08,170
They took off and started
playing supersonic music.

629
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:12,774
And supersonic music is when
the Holy Ghost takes over

630
00:33:12,774 --> 00:33:15,844
And you're playing something
that, when you hear it back,

631
00:33:15,844 --> 00:33:17,846
You have no idea
what the hell you did.

little chemistry that we had,

by anybody else.

shorter than our last tour.

00:34:08,763 --> 00:34:12,201
You know, we've been on the road
for two years and two months.

638
00:34:12,201 --> 00:34:15,104
That's two months longer
than their entire life-span.

did because it was so popular.

there and have a break, really.

00:37:42,511 --> 00:37:47,449
* As being outside of the law *

697
00:37:52,287 --> 00:37:56,691
* Had to cry today *

698
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:06,835
* Saw your sign,
and I missed you then *

699
00:38:08,337 --> 00:38:10,972
We were called a supergroup
from day one.

700
00:38:10,972 --> 00:38:12,607
We hit the road too early.

701
00:38:12,607 --> 00:38:15,377
And, you know,
it overpowered us.

702
00:38:16,645 --> 00:38:21,250
I think Ginger was as happy
as a pig in shit in Blind Faith.

703
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:24,786
You know, there was no one...
There was Rick Grech...

704
00:38:24,786 --> 00:38:28,690
Great player, you know,
but no Jack Bruce.

705
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:31,360
And Ginger could fucking do
what he wants.

706
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:42,203
* Do what you like *

707
00:38:42,203 --> 00:38:47,709
I was driving a Shelby Cobra
up the coast to Los Angeles

708
00:38:47,709 --> 00:38:51,212
With three gorgeous chicks
in the car.

709
00:38:51,212 --> 00:38:54,549
And the radio station
stopped the music

710
00:38:54,549 --> 00:38:59,721
With the news that Ginger Baker,
Blind Faith drummer,

711
00:38:59,721 --> 00:39:02,624
Had just been found dead
in his hotel room

712
00:39:02,624 --> 00:39:04,793
From a heroin overdose.

713
00:39:04,793 --> 00:39:07,195
[Laughs]

714
00:39:07,195 --> 00:39:10,399
And I went "Fucking hell.
I must be in heaven," you know?

715
00:39:10,399 --> 00:39:13,335
I'm driving this supercar
with three super chicks.

716
00:39:13,335 --> 00:39:14,669
[Laughs]

717
00:39:14,669 --> 00:39:17,171
["Do What You Like" plays]

718
00:39:17,171 --> 00:39:20,208
There was huge amounts
of drugs,

719
00:39:20,208 --> 00:39:25,580
Which at the time, I must admit,
I didn't really know about,

720
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:28,417
Because I was probably smoking
so much weed,

721
00:39:28,417 --> 00:39:30,719
I didn't really know
what was going on anyway.

722
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:34,689
Every time
we got to Los Angeles,

723
00:39:34,689 --> 00:39:36,791
The drugs would appear,

724
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:41,530
So I decided to go to Hawaii
after the tour

725
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:44,198
To try and get straight.

726
00:39:44,198 --> 00:39:47,235
So Liz come out with the kids.

727
00:39:47,235 --> 00:39:50,572
Considering all the places
we've left him before,

728
00:39:50,572 --> 00:39:53,375
I have to say it was marvelous.

729
00:39:53,375 --> 00:39:55,744
["Can't Find My Way Home"
plays]

730
00:39:55,744 --> 00:40:01,650

I've been waiting so long *

731

00:40:06,187 --> 00:40:08,923
* Well, I'm near the end *

733
00:40:08,923 --> 00:40:13,895
* And I just ain't got
the time *

734
00:40:15,263 --> 00:40:17,332
* And I'm wasted *

735
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:22,737
* And I can't find my way home *

736
00:40:22,737 --> 00:40:25,740
Only at that time,
there was more heroin on Hawaii

737
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:28,410
Than there was in Los Angeles.

738
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:32,180
It wasn't a good place to be
to get straight.

739
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,816
So we decided to go to Jamaica.

740
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:37,752
That's when I flew my car out.

741
00:40:37,752 --> 00:40:42,491
That is wild, to fly your car
over to Jamaica.

742
00:40:42,491 --> 00:40:44,793
That's crazy.

743
00:40:44,793 --> 00:40:49,498
You get to feel that the money
is inexhaustible,

744
00:40:49,498 --> 00:40:51,299
Which, of course, it isn't.

745
00:40:51,299 --> 00:40:55,570
It was like nearly three months
after the last gig

746
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:57,972
That I came back to London.

747
00:40:57,972 --> 00:41:02,644
I'd brought back quite a lot
of dope in some masks and stuff.

748
00:41:02,644 --> 00:41:04,913
And so I went to see Stevie

749
00:41:04,913 --> 00:41:08,583
With a bag of grass
as a little present.

750
00:41:08,583 --> 00:41:12,053
And he told me that Eric
had gone off

751
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:14,456
With Delaney and Bonnie

752
00:41:14,456 --> 00:41:17,125
And he was getting Traffic
back together.

753
00:41:17,125 --> 00:41:20,795
I take full responsibility
for having, you know,

754
00:41:20,795 --> 00:41:22,997
Strong interests
in going somewhere else.

755
00:41:22,997 --> 00:41:27,602
But they wouldn't have been
quite so strong

756
00:41:27,602 --> 00:41:30,539
If the core of the band
had been better.

757
00:41:30,539 --> 00:41:34,609
Were you hurt at all that Eric
had left without telling you?

758
00:41:34,609 --> 00:41:37,679
No.
You could see it coming.

759
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:40,148
Something to do with me
getting so fucked up

760
00:41:40,148 --> 00:41:42,617
On the end of the tour.

761
00:41:42,617 --> 00:41:46,688
He's the best friend I've got
on this planet

762
00:41:46,688 --> 00:41:50,224
And always will be, okay?

763
00:41:50,224 --> 00:41:54,563
Whether it be polo
or the drums or drugs,

764
00:41:54,563 --> 00:41:57,799
Ginger seems to always go
full force

765
00:41:57,799 --> 00:41:59,734
Into whatever he's doing.

766
00:41:59,734 --> 00:42:02,737
Compulsion.
We're talking about compulsion.

767
00:42:02,737 --> 00:42:07,976
You know, what's the payoff
in being compulsive?

768
00:42:07,976 --> 00:42:12,614
You know, for Ginger, I'm not
gonna be his doctor in this

769
00:42:12,614 --> 00:42:15,717
Or psychologist
or make a diagnosis.

770
00:42:15,717 --> 00:42:18,252
I can't make a diagnosis
of Ginger.

771
00:42:18,252 --> 00:42:21,189
When I was driving in today,

772
00:42:21,189 --> 00:42:24,158
I thought, "Well, do I know
Ginger well?"

773
00:42:24,158 --> 00:42:25,627
Do I?"

774
00:42:25,627 --> 00:42:29,731
I've been with him
in fairly rarefied situations,

775
00:42:29,731 --> 00:42:32,333
Which allowed me to see
certain sides of him.

776
00:42:32,333 --> 00:42:35,336
I probably haven't seen him
like you've seen him,

777
00:42:35,336 --> 00:42:38,473
Because I didn't take
the effort, the time,

778
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:42,276
The risk to step into his life
and become a part of it

779
00:42:42,276 --> 00:42:44,078
For any length of time.

780
00:42:44,078 --> 00:42:46,014
You know,
I've always pulled back

781
00:42:46,014 --> 00:42:49,083
When it started to get scary
or threatening

782
00:42:49,083 --> 00:42:51,620
Or just difficult.

783
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,857
You guys want to wait a minute?
'Cause I'm about to cry.

784
00:42:55,857 --> 00:42:56,725
Why?

785
00:42:56,725 --> 00:42:58,960
'Cause, I mean...

786
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,262
[Voice breaking]
I might cry.

787
00:43:01,262 --> 00:43:02,931
Why? Because Ginger is...

788
00:43:02,931 --> 00:43:05,834
He's all by himself, all alone,
in the woods or something.

789
00:43:05,834 --> 00:43:07,468
Well, he's got a wife.
He's got...

790
00:43:07,468 --> 00:43:08,970
Oh!
Well, then I won't.

00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:10,271

a pretty quiet life here.

793
00:43:14,108 --> 00:43:17,078
As quiet as possible.

Hello, Lisa.

796
00:43:27,922 --> 00:43:30,024
I'm extremely fond of her.

797
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:32,260
I think of her
like she's my own.

798
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:34,395
I wasn't studying yesterday.

799
00:43:34,395 --> 00:43:35,664
[Both laugh]

800
00:43:35,664 --> 00:43:38,767
She's a great little kid.

801
00:43:38,767 --> 00:43:42,470
It's really nice
to have a family again.

802
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:44,005
[Laughter]

803
00:43:44,005 --> 00:43:49,811
If that falls apart,
I really don't know what to do.

804
00:43:49,811 --> 00:43:52,647
So Ginger is a good stepfather?

805
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:58,286
Stepfather.

806
00:43:59,654 --> 00:44:01,856
Yeah.

807
00:44:01,856 --> 00:44:06,828
Do you find yourself
to be a tragic hero?

808
00:44:06,828 --> 00:44:08,763
Go on with the interview.

809
00:44:08,763 --> 00:44:12,066
Stop trying to be
an intellectual dickhead.

815
00:44:55,576 --> 00:44:57,111
Ginger's not just a player.

816
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:59,347
He's also a bandleader
and arranger.

817
00:44:59,347 --> 00:45:02,651
We were all brought up
on the big-band era, you know?

818
00:45:02,651 --> 00:45:05,386
And that's what Air force
was like.

819
00:45:05,386 --> 00:45:07,822
* Tell me *

820
00:45:07,822 --> 00:45:10,859
* Tell me, Toady *

821
00:45:10,859 --> 00:45:14,495
I made a stupid decision
of saying, "Okay."

822
00:45:14,495 --> 00:45:18,032
"Well, I've made my money
with Cream and Blind Faith,

823
00:45:18,032 --> 00:45:21,402
So I will pay the band
all the money."

825
00:45:23,838 --> 00:45:25,974
The transportation, the wages.

826
00:45:25,974 --> 00:45:29,343
The name came from
the air force section

827
00:45:29,343 --> 00:45:33,581
Of the Duke Ellington Band,
which was the junkie section.

828
00:45:33,581 --> 00:45:35,249
It really was an air force.

829
00:45:35,249 --> 00:45:38,152
I think somebody said that they
were flying at 30,000 feet,

830
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:39,688
I think it was.
[Laughs]

831
00:45:39,688 --> 00:45:41,322
It was a very high band.

832
00:45:41,322 --> 00:45:44,192
[Music continues]

833
00:45:44,192 --> 00:45:48,062
Now they're saying Air force
was some kind of a fusion band.

834
00:45:48,062 --> 00:45:50,398
I don't know
what the fuck that is.

835
00:45:50,398 --> 00:45:55,704
You can't put music in boxes,
especially my music.

836
00:45:55,704 --> 00:45:58,039
[Music ends]

837
00:46:03,812 --> 00:46:05,847
It was really exciting.

838
00:46:05,847 --> 00:46:07,548
I thought it was gonna last
forever.

839
00:46:07,548 --> 00:46:12,186
But, you know, Ginger's bands
have tended to be like that.

840
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:13,587
Didn't they?

841
00:46:13,587 --> 00:46:15,023
Like what?

842
00:46:15,023 --> 00:46:16,891
You hear them,
you think, "This is fabulous."

843
00:46:16,891 --> 00:46:18,326
It's gonna go on forever."

844
00:46:18,326 --> 00:46:19,828
And it lasts a week.

845
00:46:19,828 --> 00:46:22,831
Maybe that's just part
of being him, you know?

846
00:46:22,831 --> 00:46:24,565
I don't know.

847
00:46:24,565 --> 00:46:28,169
Because of his fame from Cream
and Blind Faith,

848
00:46:28,169 --> 00:46:29,904
You know, he was considered

849
00:46:29,904 --> 00:46:31,973
The great rock drummer
of his generation.

850
00:46:31,973 --> 00:46:34,809
But as Ginger will tell you,
he was a jazz drummer.

851
00:46:34,809 --> 00:46:38,579
The general public
are so fucking dumb.

852
00:46:38,579 --> 00:46:44,085
That, you know, like, that
anybody could think of Bonham

853
00:46:44,085 --> 00:46:49,057
Was anywhere near
this kind of drummer I am,

854
00:46:49,057 --> 00:46:51,826
It's just extraordinary.

855
00:46:51,826 --> 00:46:54,328
Bonham had technique,

856
00:46:54,328 --> 00:46:58,099
But he couldn't swing
a fucking sack of shit.

857
00:46:58,099 --> 00:47:00,769
Or Moonie, for that matter.

858
00:47:00,769 --> 00:47:05,273
I mean, if they were still alive
today, ask them.

859
00:47:05,273 --> 00:47:07,441
[Laughs]

860
00:47:07,441 --> 00:47:08,777
When they think of Ginger,

861
00:47:08,777 --> 00:47:10,544
They think of Keith Moon
and Bonham.

862
00:47:10,544 --> 00:47:13,147
No, no, no, no.

863
00:47:13,147 --> 00:47:15,750
Ginger was nothing like
those players.

864
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:18,352
His musical capabilities
are full-spectrum.

865
00:47:18,352 --> 00:47:20,521
He can write
and compose and arrange,

866
00:47:20,521 --> 00:47:23,224
And he has an ear,
and he is harmonic.

867
00:47:23,224 --> 00:47:25,159
He's a fully formed musician.

868
00:47:25,159 --> 00:47:27,762
He wanted to be respected
by the jazz drummers,

869
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:29,630
So Ginger did these drum battles

870
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:32,767
With the guys he looked up to,
thought were the great drummers.

By him taking
all these guys on...

883
00:49:17,171 --> 00:49:20,141
And nobody else really did
in the "rock world"...

884
00:49:20,141 --> 00:49:24,145
He was considered to be
in that elite echelon

885
00:49:24,145 --> 00:49:26,480
Of great jazz drummers,
which, ultimately,

886
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,549
That's what he considered
himself to be...

887
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:31,219
The great jazz drummer
of his generation.

888
00:49:31,219 --> 00:49:34,155
[British accent]
Not a fucking rock drummer.

889
00:49:34,155 --> 00:49:37,358
So, here you are,
at the height of your career.

890
00:49:37,358 --> 00:49:39,827
You've battled
all the greatest drummers.

891
00:49:39,827 --> 00:49:41,495
You've become a bandleader.

892
00:49:41,495 --> 00:49:44,432
[Laughing]
And you decide to go to Africa.

893
00:49:44,432 --> 00:49:46,200
Oh, God.

894
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:55,709
Way back, when Phil turned me on
to all the African drummers,

895
00:49:55,709 --> 00:50:04,318
It was obviously very high on my
priorities to go to Africa.

about filming me"

898
00:50:09,991 --> 00:50:11,825
And I said,
"How are you proposing

899
00:50:11,825 --> 00:50:13,461
To go across the Sahara,
Ginger?"

900
00:50:13,461 --> 00:50:15,063

There was that questing spirit
of a true artist there.

911
00:50:52,533 --> 00:50:55,369
It was news
that Ginger dropped out,

912
00:50:55,369 --> 00:50:57,571
Or he went following the groove.

"We discovered
the sounds of Africa."

00:51:14,788 --> 00:51:18,792
The only person that made me
cry before playing was Phil,

919
00:51:18,792 --> 00:51:20,528
And these guys had me crying,

920
00:51:20,528 --> 00:51:24,865
Because the time things they
were doing were just so subtle.

921
00:51:24,865 --> 00:51:27,535
This is why I went to Africa.

922

When I arrived in Nigeria,

923
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:39,113
I went straight
to the Afro Spot.

924
00:51:39,113 --> 00:51:41,849
And there was Fela
playing onstage.

00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:47,421

Some say he's the greatest
musician in Africa,

932
00:52:09,943 --> 00:52:13,681
Others that he's a prophet,
still others that he's a rebel,

he was awful to him.

at the checkpoint

And did 180
and came in backwards.

you should play polo."

and goes whack!

My sunglasses were around
one side of my face,

And my beard's around the other,
but I was still on the horse.

So I'd found
an old pair of boots

and I became a poloist.

1022
00:57:05,973 --> 00:57:08,509

as having a so-called

1023

"Colonial mentality."

1024
00:57:10,077 --> 00:57:11,812

That Fela was singing against
in the 1970s.

1026
00:57:15,248 --> 00:57:16,517
But it was later in the '70s

1027
00:57:16,517 --> 00:57:18,218
When Fela really got
more radicalized

1028
00:57:18,218 --> 00:57:20,754
And began to live the life
of a musical dissident.

1029

hanging around here.

1030

Fela took on
the government, the army.

1032

He was determined
to become president.

1033

All the government top guys
played polo,

1034
00:57:36,637 --> 00:57:39,840
So they were always
at the Lagos Polo Club.

1035
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:42,009
So I was playing polo there

1036
00:57:42,009 --> 00:57:46,046
And hanging out with,
as it were, Fela's enemies.

1037
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:49,717
And a lot of the people
on Fela's committee

1038
00:57:49,717 --> 00:57:56,557
Didn't like that and soured
Fela's mind against me.

About what?

1041
00:58:00,327 --> 00:58:06,734
Well, that Fela wouldn't play
with me, with his band.

00:58:09,870 --> 00:58:12,473
A thousand-odd soldiers
surround Calakuta,

1044
00:58:12,473 --> 00:58:14,074
Machine guns at the ready.

1045
00:58:14,074 --> 00:58:15,375
They plunder the house.

1046
00:58:15,375 --> 00:58:18,345
Their clubs spare neither
pregnant women nor children.

1047
00:58:18,345 --> 00:58:20,614
Fela himself
is seriously beaten.

1048
00:58:20,614 --> 00:58:23,417
Fela and his tribe
find themselves in prison.

1049
00:58:23,417 --> 00:58:25,553
It was starting to go wrong,
yeah.

1050
00:58:25,553 --> 00:58:28,622
But, I mean, I left Nigeria

1051
00:58:28,622 --> 00:58:31,459
Because I lost my studio,
really.

1052
00:58:31,459 --> 00:58:33,727
It took us three years
to build it.

1053
00:58:33,727 --> 00:58:36,363
It's been open
just over two years now.

1054
00:58:36,363 --> 00:58:37,965
It's coming along great.

1055
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:48,642
Presumably, there must be
a lot of music there.

1056
00:58:48,642 --> 00:58:50,778
Yeah.
We kept pretty busy.

1057
00:58:50,778 --> 00:58:53,113
We were working
all the time, yeah.

1058
00:58:53,113 --> 00:58:56,584
I think as a businessperson,
he's a walking disaster area.

1059
00:58:56,584 --> 00:59:01,254
Ginger's out there, discovering
a whole new world of sound...

1060
00:59:01,254 --> 00:59:03,056
Literally a whole new world
of sound...

1061
00:59:03,056 --> 00:59:07,728
And recording it in good faith,
not even blind faith.

1062
00:59:07,728 --> 00:59:09,497
Along comes
a gangster record company

1063
00:59:09,497 --> 00:59:11,431
And says, "We can take advantage
of that."

1064
00:59:11,431 --> 00:59:13,133
And Ginger was just taken
for a ride.

1065
00:59:13,133 --> 00:59:15,536
He said,
"You can't build a studio here.

1066
00:59:15,536 --> 00:59:17,404
This is our territory."

1067
00:59:17,404 --> 00:59:20,808
They banned all the artists
they had under contract

1068
00:59:20,808 --> 00:59:24,344
From using my studio.

1069
00:59:24,344 --> 00:59:26,647
I told him to fuck off.

1070
00:59:30,417 --> 00:59:31,819
So shortly after that,

1071
00:59:31,819 --> 00:59:34,955
Three armed soldiers entered
the studio.

1072
00:59:34,955 --> 00:59:37,925
So I just leapt out of the room,
over the balcony,

1073
00:59:37,925 --> 00:59:44,031
Got in the Range Rover, and went
straight towards the road.

1074
00:59:44,031 --> 00:59:45,398
[Gunshots]

1075
00:59:45,398 --> 00:59:48,468
I could hear all these gunshots
and ricochets going on

1076
00:59:48,468 --> 00:59:51,104
Where the police
are trying to shoot me.

1077
00:59:51,104 --> 00:59:53,541
Why did Ginger leave?

1078
00:59:53,541 --> 00:59:55,643
I just know
things were not going right.

1079
00:59:55,643 --> 01:00:00,180
But when he left,
Fela and him lost contact.

1080
01:00:37,084 --> 01:00:40,487
You had been off the scene
in Africa for so many years.

1081
01:00:40,487 --> 01:00:44,091
You must have missed being
a rock star to a certain extent.

1082
01:00:44,091 --> 01:00:46,026
No, I didn't.

1083
01:00:47,027 --> 01:00:51,832
I came back to England to play
with the Gurvitz brothers,

1084
01:00:51,832 --> 01:00:54,234
For which I got some money.

1085
01:00:54,234 --> 01:00:59,406
I'd just lost a fortune, so it
was a matter of doing some work.

1086
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:03,310
That was really
all he could get, wasn't it?

1087
01:01:03,310 --> 01:01:05,913
At that time,
nobody wanted to work with him.

1088
01:01:07,347 --> 01:01:09,416
* Now is the time *

1089
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:11,451
* Get it all together *

1090
01:01:11,451 --> 01:01:14,287
Shut up, you bloody fool!

1091
01:01:14,287 --> 01:01:15,555
* Now is the time *

1092
01:01:15,555 --> 01:01:18,391
- Hey!
- * Put yourself together *

1093
01:01:18,391 --> 01:01:23,897
Yeah, I grew up in the downward
spiral of his life,

1094
01:01:23,897 --> 01:01:26,266
Everything collapsing
and falling apart.

1095
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:30,838
The mistake I made
was letting polo take over

1096
01:01:30,838 --> 01:01:33,206
From thinking about work.

1097
01:01:33,206 --> 01:01:37,010
The tax people saw this film
the BBC did

1098
01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:41,014
Of these horses arriving
and gave the impression

1099
01:01:41,014 --> 01:01:43,283
That I'd got a hell of a lot
of money.

1100
01:01:43,283 --> 01:01:48,088
Only this week, 30 polo ponies
arrived from Argentina.

1101
01:01:48,088 --> 01:01:51,491
This air shipment guarantees
Ginger Baker's commitment

1102
01:01:51,491 --> 01:01:55,228
To a sport that stands for
everything he isn't.

1103
01:01:55,228 --> 01:01:58,065
I went absolutely broke.

1104
01:01:58,065 --> 01:02:03,103
It was a very bad time
altogether.

1105
01:02:03,103 --> 01:02:08,475
He left my mom for my first
boyfriend's sister.

1106
01:02:08,976 --> 01:02:13,280
That was his second wife,
was my first boyfriend's sister.

1107
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:16,483
There's a good idea!

1108
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:18,118
She was 18, you know?

1109
01:02:18,118 --> 01:02:20,120
[Laughs]

1110
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:23,023
Well, maybe 17.
I don't know.

1111
01:02:23,023 --> 01:02:25,592
She was still going to school.

1112
01:02:26,326 --> 01:02:29,863
She was a very naughty-type
girl, yeah.

1113
01:02:31,699 --> 01:02:35,468
Very sexy-type girl.

1114
01:02:35,468 --> 01:02:37,805
* Powder blues *

1115
01:02:42,375 --> 01:02:46,814
The tax people go, "You owe us,
you know, £150,000."

1116
01:02:46,814 --> 01:02:49,382
And it's like, you know,
he doesn't have £150,000,

1117
01:02:49,382 --> 01:02:51,118
So they took the house.

1118
01:02:51,118 --> 01:02:52,986
We'd lived in that house
all our lives.

1119
01:02:52,986 --> 01:02:54,554
And then one day you come home

1120
01:02:54,554 --> 01:02:56,123
And there's a whole load
of police

1121
01:02:56,123 --> 01:02:57,624
And a whole load of bailiffs,

1122
01:02:57,624 --> 01:02:59,626
And they just won't let you
back into your house.

1123
01:02:59,626 --> 01:03:02,162
And they just take everything
that you've ever owned.

1124
01:03:02,162 --> 01:03:04,031
I just, you know, took my drums

1125
01:03:04,031 --> 01:03:07,034
And went and lived
on the streets, lived in squats.

1126
01:03:07,034 --> 01:03:09,502
You know, I used to
tie my drums to my hands

1127
01:03:09,502 --> 01:03:13,306
When I went to sleep
so that no one could take them.

1128
01:03:13,306 --> 01:03:15,642
You know, I don't think
he should've had a family.

1129
01:03:15,642 --> 01:03:18,045
I think he would have been
way better off in his life

1130
01:03:18,045 --> 01:03:21,214
If he'd never had kids and just,
you know, did his thing.

1131
01:03:22,582 --> 01:03:26,153
He would have left
a lot less of a mess behind.

1132
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:30,824
Most of the time Ginger was
with Baker Gurvitz Army,

1133
01:03:30,824 --> 01:03:33,193
He wasn't really
on the hard stuff.

1134
01:03:33,193 --> 01:03:34,261
Oh, yeah.

1135
01:03:34,261 --> 01:03:39,332
I'm a lot, you know...
better in myself.

1136
01:03:39,332 --> 01:03:41,634
Fit and well,
if you like, you know?

1137
01:03:41,634 --> 01:03:43,270
The hard stuff came back

1138
01:03:43,270 --> 01:03:46,073
In the recording
of "Hearts on Fire."

1139
01:03:46,073 --> 01:03:49,342
[Mid-tempo rock music plays]

1140
01:03:54,681 --> 01:03:59,452
It was sort of like
a pretty disastrous period,

1141
01:03:59,452 --> 01:04:01,989
So I got back into using.

1142
01:04:01,989 --> 01:04:03,757
And that's
when you sort of realize

1143
01:04:03,757 --> 01:04:08,695
Your idols have feet of clay,
the slight inkling coming in

1144
01:04:08,695 --> 01:04:11,164
That this person isn't
in control.

1145
01:04:11,164 --> 01:04:14,701
The cameraman's in control.

1146
01:04:14,701 --> 01:04:16,770
Hello.

1147
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:18,571
Um...

1148
01:04:18,571 --> 01:04:20,473
What were you saying?

1149
01:04:20,473 --> 01:04:22,776
[Music continues]

1150
01:04:41,728 --> 01:04:44,131
[Guitar strums,

1151

Jeff, get us a glass of wine,
will you?

01:04:46,566 --> 01:04:48,902
[Clattering]

1153
01:04:48,902 --> 01:04:51,571
Fucking hell, man.
I tried hard.

1154
01:04:51,571 --> 01:04:53,340
[Tape rewinds]

1155
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:57,477
I'd decided, "I'd better
get away from anybody I know"

1156
01:04:57,477 --> 01:05:00,147
If I'm ever going to
get straight."

1157
01:05:00,147 --> 01:05:03,550
So I decided to go to Italy.

1158
01:05:03,550 --> 01:05:06,153
I went to Italy with Sarah,

1159
01:05:06,153 --> 01:05:09,890
Living on this place right
on top of a fucking mountain,

1160
01:05:09,890 --> 01:05:13,026
And I've never lived
in England since.

1161
01:05:13,026 --> 01:05:14,862
I didn't know anybody.

1162
01:05:14,862 --> 01:05:17,030
I didn't even speak Italian.

1163
01:05:17,030 --> 01:05:20,500
And the house was falling down.

1164
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:23,536
I met him in '86,

1165
01:05:23,536 --> 01:05:27,540
And I was asked to find him by
a singer called Johnny Rotten,

1166
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:29,309
Who was in The Sex Pistols.

1167
01:05:29,309 --> 01:05:33,713
He was living
in a pretty obscure situation,

1168
01:05:33,713 --> 01:05:35,382
Rough situation.

1169
01:05:35,382 --> 01:05:38,585
And in the house, which was
completely in kind of shambles,

1170
01:05:38,585 --> 01:05:42,990
I think there was two horses
and seven dogs, no electricity,

1171
01:05:42,990 --> 01:05:45,025
And a room that overlooked
the mountain

1172
01:05:45,025 --> 01:05:46,994
With a drum kit in it...
Only a drum kit.

1173
01:05:46,994 --> 01:05:50,430
But when he played in that room
and it echoed over the hills,

1174
01:05:50,430 --> 01:05:53,934
You could hear people
like five miles away, screaming,

1175
01:05:53,934 --> 01:05:55,702
"Ginger!
'Wheels of fire'!"

1176
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:59,672
Sarah obviously married him
because she wanted a rock star.

1177
01:05:59,672 --> 01:06:01,108
Hey, you know?

1178
01:06:01,108 --> 01:06:03,610
And he took her
to this little bum-fuck town,

1179
01:06:03,610 --> 01:06:05,879
And she was like,
"Well, what the hell?" you know?

1180
01:06:05,879 --> 01:06:07,414
"Where's all
the rock-star shit?"

1181
01:06:07,414 --> 01:06:09,950
And when I went out there
with some young people,

1182
01:06:09,950 --> 01:06:12,319
She went off with one of them,
and that was the end of that.

1183
01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:13,887
And he was
absolutely devastated,

1184
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:17,624
Because he couldn't handle
his own medicine, unfortunately.

1185
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:22,029
Was he heartbroken?
Oh, yeah.

1186
01:06:22,029 --> 01:06:24,431
Yeah.
She fucked him good, yeah.

1187
01:06:24,431 --> 01:06:26,866
I was completely
fucking destroyed.

1188
01:06:26,866 --> 01:06:31,471
I was on my own with all my dogs
and a couple of horses.

1189
01:06:32,572 --> 01:06:34,774
[Chuckles]

1190
01:06:34,774 --> 01:06:38,111
I mean, it was terrible.

1191
01:06:38,111 --> 01:06:40,547
I went out there to get
drum lessons and stuff.

1192
01:06:40,547 --> 01:06:41,915
He had no money,

1193
01:06:41,915 --> 01:06:44,784
So he couldn't get me
a plane ticket back to England.

1194
01:06:44,784 --> 01:06:46,386
So we had to do this gig.

1195
01:06:46,386 --> 01:06:49,089
So I got really, really sick,
right, the day of the gig.

1196
01:06:49,089 --> 01:06:51,391
I was sitting on a chair,
and I was throwing up,

1197
01:06:51,391 --> 01:06:53,093
And I was just, like,
a really bad way.

1198
01:06:53,093 --> 01:06:55,128
I was like,
"I don't know if I can play."

1199
01:06:55,128 --> 01:06:57,998
So, you know,
he chops out a line of cocaine.

1200
01:06:57,998 --> 01:06:59,266
"Take this."

1201
01:06:59,266 --> 01:07:01,201
I'd never done cocaine before,
you know?

1202
01:07:01,201 --> 01:07:03,470
Like, "I'm 15 years old,"
you know?

1203
01:07:03,470 --> 01:07:05,705
So I ended up taking this line
of cocaine.

1204
01:07:05,705 --> 01:07:07,274
Played the gig fine.

1205
01:07:07,274 --> 01:07:10,543
Somehow, it just, like,
you know, makes you feel good.

1206
01:07:10,543 --> 01:07:14,447
So then he put me on a coach
back to England, you know,

1207
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:16,016
And he took the rest
of the money

1208
01:07:16,016 --> 01:07:17,450
And wouldn't get me
a plane ticket.

1209
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:19,452
And we made good money
at that gig.

[Dog barking]

1211
01:07:31,298 --> 01:07:36,569
I started getting these letters
from some guy in L.A.

1212
01:07:36,569 --> 01:07:38,205
He kept saying, "Oh, man",

1213
01:07:38,205 --> 01:07:41,374

in films."

1215
01:07:43,676 --> 01:07:46,113

That was the end of it for me.

1223
01:08:08,335 --> 01:08:10,303
I mean, it was just so stupid.

Last one on is a rotten egg.

1225
01:08:13,473 --> 01:08:15,242
I hadn't seen him for years.

1226
01:08:15,242 --> 01:08:17,644
When I arrived in L.A.,
I didn't recognize him,

1227
01:08:17,644 --> 01:08:19,712
'Cause he looked like
an old man.

1228
01:08:19,712 --> 01:08:21,414
And I thought, "Where's my dad?"

1229
01:08:21,414 --> 01:08:25,085
He actually put an ad
on Music Connection magazine

Are you ready to go?

1235
01:08:35,895 --> 01:08:39,799
Okay. So this is a drum kit,
and I'm Ginger Baker.

1236
01:08:39,799 --> 01:08:42,169
You hold the drumstick thusly,

1237
01:08:42,169 --> 01:08:45,505
And you play the stick
like that.

1238
01:08:45,505 --> 01:08:48,241
The 1960s were heady times
for Ginger Baker.

1239
01:08:48,241 --> 01:08:49,576
He was a drummer

1240
01:08:49,576 --> 01:08:51,544
For some of rock music's
most influential groups.

1241
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:53,413
We visited Baker
at the ranch he rents

1242
01:08:53,413 --> 01:08:56,516
In the California desert
as he tries to come back.

1243

Tell me about your relationship
these days with Eric Clapton.

1244

Do you still speak?

1245
01:09:00,687 --> 01:09:04,491
I don't have a lot in common
with Eric nowadays.

1246
01:09:06,326 --> 01:09:09,262
He's sort of...

1247
01:09:10,397 --> 01:09:12,832
Changed considerably.

1248
01:09:12,832 --> 01:09:14,201
Ginger, the way he is

1249
01:09:14,201 --> 01:09:16,769
And the way, you know,
his self-medication

1250
01:09:16,769 --> 01:09:19,606
And all of the kind of things
that go on in his life,

1251
01:09:19,606 --> 01:09:23,443
I would find quite hard to be
around for any length of time.

1252
01:09:23,443 --> 01:09:25,945
It was quite threatening,
you know, to me

1253
01:09:25,945 --> 01:09:28,748
And I suppose what I would call
my sobriety.

1254
01:09:28,748 --> 01:09:31,318
But I've always
got time for him, you know,

1255
01:09:31,318 --> 01:09:33,120
And I know he knows that.

1256
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:36,489
There was nothing starlike
about him when I first met him.

1257
01:09:36,489 --> 01:09:38,625
He was pretty much penniless
when we met

1258
01:09:38,625 --> 01:09:42,829
And had spent everything to get
his horses over to America.

1259
01:09:42,829 --> 01:09:44,164
I was pretty happy.

1260
01:09:44,164 --> 01:09:45,932
I was gonna be going into
a master's program

1262

There was a lot of great stuff
ahead of me.

1263
01:09:49,536 --> 01:09:52,705
And then I got
a little derailed.

1264
01:09:52,705 --> 01:09:54,407
Was Karen a good person?

1265
01:09:57,377 --> 01:10:00,447
I don't want to discuss Karen.

1266
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:04,317
He is somebody
who needs to be cared for,

1267
01:10:04,317 --> 01:10:06,686
And maybe that's what was
so attractive to me.

1268
01:10:06,686 --> 01:10:08,521
It was like,
"I can help this person."

1269
01:10:08,521 --> 01:10:10,823
He was somebody really
interesting to spend time with.

1270
01:10:10,823 --> 01:10:12,792
He started playing the drums,
and actually,

1271
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:16,329
That was the first time
I really understood the drums.

1272
01:10:22,602 --> 01:10:24,571
Nobody wanted to play with him.

1273
01:10:24,571 --> 01:10:25,872
And this is L.A.

1274
01:10:25,872 --> 01:10:29,008
I mean, there should have been
gigs everywhere for him.

1275
01:10:29,008 --> 01:10:32,612
People were just like, "Mm. No.
It's too much trouble."

1276
01:10:34,547 --> 01:10:38,017
And then finally, he did join
The Masters of Reality.

1278

quite an enjoyable thing,

heavy metal, which it wasn't.

When we were on tour
with Alice In Chains,

1288
01:11:17,924 --> 01:11:19,392
I think it was a mismatch.

all over again,

Just like a new musician.

1296

Nobody wanted to play with him
anymore.

So we started a polo club
called Mile High Polo.

And that worked out beautifully,

Because he didn't have to go
and play with other people.

Not only can he play drums,

But he can hit that ball
down the field.

People would come out, bring
their kids, bring their dogs.

We'd have polo
and then jazz in the park.

1321
01:12:38,338 --> 01:12:42,174
He would get off the horse,
come over in his polo uniform,

1322

And sit down at the drums.

1323

And then we'd just go
into something from there.

experience to see.

01:16:07,346 --> 01:16:11,117
All four of them
became friends...

1378
01:16:11,117 --> 01:16:13,720
I mean friends.

1379
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:15,221
Dear friends.

1380
01:16:15,221 --> 01:16:19,759
[Voice breaking]
And that to me is worth...

1381
01:16:19,759 --> 01:16:22,962
More to me
than anything in the world.

[Down-tempo jazz playing]

1383
01:16:44,917 --> 01:16:49,055
Anywhere Ginger goes,
it's just a matter of time

1384
01:16:49,055 --> 01:16:52,258
Before there's gonna be
controversy going on.

1385
01:16:53,225 --> 01:16:56,062
Somebody did a very nasty

1386
01:16:56,062 --> 01:17:00,432
And resulted in Liz
getting arrested yesterday

1387
01:17:00,432 --> 01:17:03,135
By the immigration people.

1388
01:17:03,135 --> 01:17:05,572
He had an English groom
that was living with us.

1389
01:17:05,572 --> 01:17:08,841
But because her immigration
papers hadn't come through yet,

1390
01:17:08,841 --> 01:17:11,477
She was illegal,
and so they took her away.

1391
01:17:11,477 --> 01:17:14,280
And I started going crazy.

1392
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:18,017
And there was these two guys,
Louis & Floorwax,

1393
01:17:18,017 --> 01:17:20,920
Who had a radio show
that I was on.

1394
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:23,355
He came on the radio show
one morning

1395
01:17:23,355 --> 01:17:24,891
And started talking about it.

1396
01:17:24,891 --> 01:17:27,560
And he literally told everybody
to fuck off.

1397
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:29,996
I mean, this is a foul deed.

1398
01:17:29,996 --> 01:17:32,765
He said something about
the United States of America

1399
01:17:32,765 --> 01:17:35,501
Can kiss my ass or blow me
or something like that.

1400
01:17:35,501 --> 01:17:37,904
I think that's the last thing
he said on our show.

1401
01:17:37,904 --> 01:17:39,806
I believe that was
the final sentence.

1402
01:17:39,806 --> 01:17:41,608
So we ended the interview,

1403
01:17:41,608 --> 01:17:44,076
And next thing we heard,
he was deported.

1404
01:17:44,076 --> 01:17:46,879
He thought he was seeing
the writing on the wall.

1405
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:48,781
I'm the next target now.

1406
01:17:48,781 --> 01:17:50,817
So he decided to grab his toys
and leave

1407
01:17:50,817 --> 01:17:53,085
Before they could kick him out.

1408
01:17:53,085 --> 01:17:56,122
People are saying it's one of
the best records he's ever done,

1409
01:17:56,122 --> 01:17:57,356
And then he left.

1410
01:17:57,356 --> 01:18:00,593
We just put this record out,
and he just split.

1411
01:18:00,593 --> 01:18:02,528
Kofi would come over
every single day

1412
01:18:02,528 --> 01:18:03,830
And play with his dad.

1413
01:18:03,830 --> 01:18:05,732
And then a couple days
before he left,

1414
01:18:05,732 --> 01:18:08,000
Kind of like you
with the cane to your face,

1415
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,202
Ginger gave a verbal cane
to Kofi's face

1416
01:18:10,202 --> 01:18:12,071
And just basically I think
told him,

1417
01:18:12,071 --> 01:18:13,940
"You're a piece-of-shit drummer,

1418
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:16,242
And you'll never be what I am,
and you just can't get it."

1419
01:18:16,242 --> 01:18:21,480
And that was it...
His way of saying goodbye.

1420
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:23,149
Well, I asked him.

1421
01:18:23,149 --> 01:18:26,085
I said, "Do you even care about
anything I do or anything?"

1422
01:18:26,085 --> 01:18:28,020
He said, "No."
So I said, "Fine."

1423
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:29,221
So I got in my car and left.

1424
01:18:29,221 --> 01:18:31,223
That was the last time
I saw him.

["Can't Find My Way Home"

1426
01:18:39,866 --> 01:18:42,769
I don't know
if it's his ability to move on

1427
01:18:42,769 --> 01:18:45,104
Or his inability to stay.

1428
01:18:45,104 --> 01:18:50,109
I think he has trouble staying,
and so moving on is his option.

1429
01:18:50,109 --> 01:18:52,011
I went with him
on several of those moves,

1430
01:18:52,011 --> 01:18:53,780
And then the last one,
I decided, "No."

for one more of these."

[Indistinct talking on P.A.]

1433
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:04,691
Maybe it goes back
to when his dad died.

1434
01:19:04,691 --> 01:19:07,894
He was just kind of taken away
abruptly,

1435
01:19:07,894 --> 01:19:10,162
And there was nothing
he could do about it.

1436
01:19:11,030 --> 01:19:16,268
The only time I remember
my dad clearly is on the train,

1437
01:19:16,268 --> 01:19:19,806
When he went off
after his last leave.

1438
01:19:21,941 --> 01:19:25,812
And as the train pulled off,
I broke away from my mom

1439
01:19:25,812 --> 01:19:27,814
And went running
down the platform

1440
01:19:27,814 --> 01:19:30,817
After the train, crying.

01:19:32,484 --> 01:19:37,423

he wasn't coming back.

I would ever have dreamt
of going,

appalled

when it's the end of the path.

01:26:18,890 --> 01:26:20,759
Yes!

1546
01:26:22,194 --> 01:26:26,298
Ginger Baker just hit me
in the fucking nose.

1547
01:26:28,334 --> 01:26:30,169
At first I was really pissed.

1548
01:26:30,169 --> 01:26:33,239
Say you're sorry!
No!

1549
01:26:33,872 --> 01:26:40,379
But then I realized
the madman is alive and well,

1550
01:26:40,379 --> 01:26:44,850
With a precise message
to all those who dare enter...

1551
01:26:44,850 --> 01:26:48,254
Beware of Mr. Baker.

1552
01:26:48,987 --> 01:26:51,357
[Rhythmic clapping]

1553
01:26:51,357 --> 01:26:54,160
[Chanting]
Ginger Baker! Ginger Baker!

1554
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:57,095
Ginger Baker!
Ginger Baker!

1555
01:26:57,229 --> 01:27:00,299
Ginger Baker!
Ginger Baker!

1556
01:27:00,432 --> 01:27:01,833
Ginger Baker!

1557
01:27:01,833 --> 01:27:04,035
He seems to go through wars
and bombs

1558
01:27:04,035 --> 01:27:07,539
And comes out the other end
unscathed, amazingly.

1559
01:27:07,539 --> 01:27:09,275
And you've got to admire that.

1560
01:27:09,275 --> 01:27:10,809
You've got to admire that,

1561
01:27:10,809 --> 01:27:14,112
That he doesn't ever
kind of give in and go, "Okay."

1562
01:27:14,112 --> 01:27:15,781
[Chanting continues]

1563
01:27:15,781 --> 01:27:21,487
The indomitable Ginger Baker
always gets up off the canvas.

1564
01:27:21,487 --> 01:27:27,159
After selling his horses,
his farm, and his Range Rover,

1565
01:27:27,159 --> 01:27:28,760
He goes back on the road

1566
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:32,164
And to being the one thing
that he's always been.

1567
01:27:32,164 --> 01:27:35,401
[Cheers and applause]

1568
01:27:47,879 --> 01:27:49,815
Do what you like.

1569
01:27:49,815 --> 01:27:53,552
If you enjoy doing something
and you do it very well,

1570
01:27:53,552 --> 01:27:56,788
You can be successful
and enjoy life.

1571
01:27:56,788 --> 01:27:58,924
I like playing the drums.

1572
01:27:58,924 --> 01:28:01,327
[Laughs]

1573
01:28:01,327 --> 01:28:04,663
I know what my life's
experiences are,

1574
01:28:04,663 --> 01:28:08,534
And I like to exemplify them
in music.

1575
01:28:08,534 --> 01:28:11,437
Mr. Baker does the same.

1576
01:28:11,437 --> 01:28:14,273
If that makes him
an unpleasant person socially,

1577
01:28:14,273 --> 01:28:16,908
Well, that's exactly
what is required

1578
01:28:16,908 --> 01:28:21,613
For the music from him
to be so superb.

1579
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:29,555
And I cannot question anyone
with end results that perfect.

1580
01:28:32,291 --> 01:28:34,726
[Drumming continues]

1581
01:28:42,033 --> 01:28:44,236
[Cheers and applause]

1582
01:29:03,989 --> 01:29:06,925
["Blue Condition" plays]

1583
01:29:06,925 --> 01:29:12,130
* Don't take
the wrong direction *

1584
01:29:12,130 --> 01:29:14,933
* Passing through *

1585
01:29:16,635 --> 01:29:19,671
This is a Hollywood movie
here, so...

1586
01:29:19,671 --> 01:29:20,672
Oh...

1587
01:29:20,672 --> 01:29:22,874
It's got to be
really dramatic,

1588
01:29:22,874 --> 01:29:25,611
And I need to get you to cry
at a certain point.

1589
01:29:25,611 --> 01:29:27,279
So if you could just cry
right now...

1590
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:29,114
Oh, yeah.

1591
01:29:29,114 --> 01:29:30,982
You're dumb.
You know that?

1592
01:29:30,982 --> 01:29:32,451
You really are dumb.

1593
01:29:32,451 --> 01:29:36,755
Good God, I'm talking to
a fucking block of moronic wood.

1594
01:29:36,755 --> 01:29:40,191
Just a single tear,
like really slow-motion,

1595
01:29:40,191 --> 01:29:41,793
Down the side of your face.

1596
01:29:41,793 --> 01:29:45,297
If we could just get that shot,
it would be great.

1597
01:29:48,667 --> 01:29:52,604
Trying to explain to a dumb
American is very difficult.

1598
01:29:52,604 --> 01:29:56,542
If a stick had five right ends
and one wrong end,

1599
01:29:56,542 --> 01:29:59,745
You'd get the wrong end
every time.

1600
01:29:59,745 --> 01:30:01,647
[Sobs]

1601
01:30:01,647 --> 01:30:04,383
I'm crying for you.

1602
01:30:08,119 --> 01:30:09,921
Hello?

1603
01:30:09,921 --> 01:30:12,758
Spring will be a little late
this year.

1604
01:30:12,758 --> 01:30:15,561
Talk about three short blanks.

1605
01:30:15,561 --> 01:30:17,796
You take the biscuit, boy.

1606
01:30:19,197 --> 01:30:22,000
You drive me fucking crazy.

01:30:24,069 --> 01:30:29,007

no laughter *

1608
01:30:29,007 --> 01:30:31,843
