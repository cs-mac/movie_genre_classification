2
00:02:02,335 --> 00:02:04,199
Find me

3
00:02:42,484 --> 00:02:43,969
closer

4
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:37,076
Found you

5
00:03:40,548 --> 00:03:41,510
Ah ha!

6
00:03:41,535 --> 00:03:43,073
You think you could hide
from me, did you?

7
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:45,896
Did you read what it said?
It said found you.

8
00:03:45,921 --> 00:03:48,210
- It didn't say tickle...
- Samuel. Bee.

9
00:03:48,235 --> 00:03:49,876
That's enough.

10
00:03:53,744 --> 00:03:56,793
- You don't want to get overheated.
- I'm not.

11
00:03:56,818 --> 00:03:58,235
You're sure?

12
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,423
Good.
Because now it's my turn!

13
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,386
- Dad, help!
- You need help?

14
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:04,291
Oh sure, I can
help tickle you.

15
00:04:05,761 --> 00:04:08,646
I think the bottom of this feet
might be very ticklish.

16
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:23,649
Time for bed, Bee.

17
00:04:26,829 --> 00:04:28,230
Thank you.

18
00:04:35,543 --> 00:04:38,277
- I love you Mommy.
- I love you more.

19
00:04:43,811 --> 00:04:45,160
Mommy?

20
00:04:51,605 --> 00:04:54,545
- Just for a little while.
- Thanks.

21
00:05:24,004 --> 00:05:25,236
- Mommy.
- Um-hm.

22
00:05:25,261 --> 00:05:27,540
Can we play dollies
when we get home?

23
00:05:27,565 --> 00:05:30,706
Well, I think if you help me
with the washing up

24
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:34,111
- I can play dollies with you all afternoon.
- Sam.

25
00:05:34,136 --> 00:05:35,019
Yes!

26
00:05:35,044 --> 00:05:36,176
Sam.

27
00:05:37,094 --> 00:05:38,122
Good morning, Sam.

28
00:05:38,147 --> 00:05:39,501
- Good morning, Esther.
- Morning.

29
00:05:39,526 --> 00:05:41,385
Hey there, busy Bee.

30
00:05:41,877 --> 00:05:43,447
Sam, just wondering...

31
00:05:43,472 --> 00:05:45,225
if you got that order
of mine ready yet?

32
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,655
I got customers coming
into my store everyday

33
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,368
asking about your dolls.

34
00:05:49,393 --> 00:05:51,785
You can send your son
over tomorrow, Vic.

35
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:52,951
They're ready.

36
00:05:52,976 --> 00:05:53,987
Well, hallelujah.

37
00:05:54,012 --> 00:05:56,341
I guess prayers do
get answered, don't they?

38
00:05:56,366 --> 00:05:57,338
They do.

39
00:05:57,363 --> 00:05:59,828
Oh right... well, thank you so much.
You all have a good Sunday.

40
00:05:59,853 --> 00:06:02,097
- You have a good day too.
- You have a lovely day.

41
00:06:04,146 --> 00:06:05,536
In you get.

42
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:10,058
Damn it!

43
00:06:10,467 --> 00:06:12,023
Language.

44
00:06:16,299 --> 00:06:18,261
There's a car coming,
why don't I wave it down

45
00:06:18,286 --> 00:06:19,690
and see if we can
get some help.

46
00:06:19,715 --> 00:06:21,577
No, no, no, no.
I got it.

47
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:31,160
I'll get it.

48
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,458
BEE!

49
00:06:37,483 --> 00:06:39,039
No!

54
00:07:25,713 --> 00:07:28,193
Okay.
Pick a number.

55
00:07:29,156 --> 00:07:30,548
Linda?

56
00:07:31,373 --> 00:07:32,939
Um.

57
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:34,998
Four.

58
00:07:35,149 --> 00:07:36,573
Okay.

59
00:07:37,444 --> 00:07:39,943
You'll soon make new friends.

60
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,685
Do my now.

61
00:07:45,649 --> 00:07:47,201
What's wrong?

62
00:07:48,584 --> 00:07:50,943
I just wish you and me
were going to a new home

63
00:07:50,968 --> 00:07:53,117
instead of a new orphanage.

64
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,928
Sweet Sue thinks too.

65
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,993
It would be nice
to have a home.

66
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:04,653
Yeah, but...
only if you're there.

67
00:08:04,678 --> 00:08:07,182
I don't want to go
anywhere you're not.

68
00:08:09,136 --> 00:08:10,719
So, let's swear.

69
00:08:10,744 --> 00:08:14,107
If someone wants one of us,
they get both of us.

70
00:08:14,412 --> 00:08:17,189
Okay.
I swear.

71
00:08:17,214 --> 00:08:18,539
Good.

72
00:08:18,941 --> 00:08:20,383
Me too.

73
00:08:21,312 --> 00:08:23,903
You know what I like most
about Sweet Sue?

74
00:08:24,232 --> 00:08:25,522
What?

75
00:08:27,275 --> 00:08:29,270
She looks just like you.

76
00:08:32,105 --> 00:08:34,447
So, how much further
is it, father?

77
00:08:34,768 --> 00:08:38,525
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
You're worse than the children, sister.

78
00:08:39,846 --> 00:08:43,676
The Mullins agreeing to take
us in was a gift from god.

79
00:08:43,701 --> 00:08:47,024
What kind of person isn't
excited about getting a gift?

80
00:08:47,323 --> 00:08:49,576
I should mention
don't be alarm if you...

81
00:08:49,601 --> 00:08:52,265
don't see much of
Mrs Mullins at first.

82
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,773
She... has a condition.

83
00:08:54,798 --> 00:08:59,226
You see, she was in
an accident years ago.

84
00:08:59,251 --> 00:09:02,356
You girls would do well
to help her if need be.

85
00:10:13,298 --> 00:10:16,369
Janice.
You need help?

86
00:10:16,394 --> 00:10:18,911
No, thanks.
I can manage.

87
00:10:24,448 --> 00:10:25,875
Sister.

88
00:10:27,202 --> 00:10:30,524
She's one of the unfortunate ones
with that polio outbreak,

89
00:10:30,549 --> 00:10:33,321
but she's getting stronger everyday.

90
00:10:33,346 --> 00:10:36,102
She won't be a burden,
I promise you.

91
00:10:36,127 --> 00:10:37,295
Um-hm.

92
00:10:37,334 --> 00:10:40,950
Mr Mullins, why don't
you show the girls around?

93
00:10:41,294 --> 00:10:43,707
I can unload their belongings.

94
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,147
We'll start inside.

95
00:10:46,393 --> 00:10:48,129
Thank you, father.

96
00:10:57,036 --> 00:10:59,936
Wow.
This is an amazing castle.

97
00:10:59,961 --> 00:11:02,663
Which obviously makes us the princesses.

98
00:11:02,688 --> 00:11:04,097
This is our new orphanage?

99
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:06,816
Which is fine if
we're never being adopted.

100
00:11:09,527 --> 00:11:10,802
There's a TV.

101
00:11:10,827 --> 00:11:15,097
The television no longer works,
the radio however does.

102
00:11:20,481 --> 00:11:23,023
This goes on forever.

103
00:11:23,048 --> 00:11:25,925
You're right. We're going to need
a map to find our way around.

104
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,155
Girls, this way.

105
00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:32,315
As you can see, the dining room
is more than adequate

106
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,503
to accommodate all of us.

107
00:11:37,201 --> 00:11:38,326
Wow.
What's in here?

108
00:11:38,351 --> 00:11:40,165
Let's stay together.

109
00:11:47,562 --> 00:11:50,130
Mrs Mullins and I stay in here.

110
00:11:50,454 --> 00:11:54,055
Fell free to use the rest of the
downstairs as you see fit.

111
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,289
Your rooms are upstairs.

112
00:11:56,771 --> 00:11:57,877
Mr Mullins.

113
00:11:57,902 --> 00:12:01,847
Is there someway Janice and I
can maybe stay down here?

114
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,522
Me too.

115
00:12:03,707 --> 00:12:05,256
I'll be fine.

116
00:12:19,712 --> 00:12:22,343
I installed it years ago
for my wife.

117
00:12:22,368 --> 00:12:26,370
Hasn't been used in ages,
it works fine.

118
00:12:26,859 --> 00:12:28,556
Try it, Jan.

119
00:12:30,402 --> 00:12:32,469
If you don't, I will.

120
00:12:37,634 --> 00:12:38,974
Up is up

121
00:12:39,099 --> 00:12:40,717
Down is down.

122
00:12:40,781 --> 00:12:42,622
It won't work...

123
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:46,969
... unless you click the seat belt in.

124
00:12:47,732 --> 00:12:49,170
Like this.

125
00:12:51,223 --> 00:12:52,704
Simple.

126
00:13:03,886 --> 00:13:05,400
Thank you.

127
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,079
I get to go next!

128
00:14:18,813 --> 00:14:20,776
Wow.
Nice.

129
00:14:20,801 --> 00:14:23,373
I guess this is ours.

130
00:14:24,878 --> 00:14:27,779
Let's take that side.

131
00:14:27,804 --> 00:14:30,004
Kate and Tierney can have these.

132
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:32,305
What about Linda and me?

133
00:14:32,711 --> 00:14:36,469
Relax, Janice. This is a big house,
there are other bedrooms.

134
00:14:36,494 --> 00:14:38,479
Why can't Linda and me
have those over there?

135
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:42,129
Okay, but then,
where would Kate and Tierney sleep?

136
00:14:48,918 --> 00:14:50,394
Wow.

137
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:52,058
This is neat.

138
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,518
I got this one.

139
00:15:20,637 --> 00:15:21,929
Locked.

140
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,502
And it stays that way too.

141
00:15:33,334 --> 00:15:36,056
Hey, Jan.
In here.

142
00:16:04,008 --> 00:16:05,275
Hey.

143
00:16:06,445 --> 00:16:08,667
You wanna bunk beds?

144
00:17:25,733 --> 00:17:28,341
- Hey sister Charlotte, can we...
- Oh lord.

145
00:17:28,366 --> 00:17:32,840
Please bless Nancy with the wisdom
to not give people their heart attacks.

146
00:17:32,865 --> 00:17:34,130
Sorry.

147
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,581
What is your emergency?

148
00:17:35,606 --> 00:17:36,866
Can we go exploring?

149
00:17:36,891 --> 00:17:38,878
Help father Massey with
your things first and then...

150
00:17:38,903 --> 00:17:40,486
But Mr Mullins insist that we go.

151
00:17:40,511 --> 00:17:42,747
- But that doesn't mean you don't have to...
- You know how father Massey is.

152
00:17:42,772 --> 00:17:44,702
We'll only get in the way.

153
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,924
- Fine.
- She said okay!

154
00:17:48,949 --> 00:17:51,056
But look out for one another.

155
00:17:55,646 --> 00:17:57,336
You coming, Jan?

156
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,395
Maybe in a little while.

157
00:18:01,176 --> 00:18:02,527
Well.

158
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:05,075
Maybe I'll stay too.

159
00:18:05,372 --> 00:18:07,569
Because you feel sorry for me?

160
00:18:08,472 --> 00:18:09,632
Well...

161
00:18:09,657 --> 00:18:12,845
You promised you wouldn't
treat me any differently.

162
00:18:12,982 --> 00:18:14,363
Okay.

163
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,780
See ya!

164
00:19:56,558 --> 00:20:00,462
Dear lord.
Thank you for bringing us all together.

165
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:04,101
Bless this food for our use,

166
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,835
and us to thy service.

167
00:20:07,904 --> 00:20:10,861
Fill our hearts with grateful praise.

168
00:20:11,337 --> 00:20:15,099
And help us give you
glory each day through

169
00:20:17,026 --> 00:20:19,788
Jesus Christ our Lord.
Amen.

170
00:20:19,813 --> 00:20:21,113
Amen.

171
00:20:32,517 --> 00:20:34,456
If you'd excuse me.

172
00:21:09,372 --> 00:21:10,804
Carol.

173
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:19,153
Keep to your own business.

174
00:21:31,053 --> 00:21:36,103
And if I die before I wake,
I pray the lord my soul to take.

175
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,384
Please, god.
Help Linda and me find a good home

176
00:21:38,409 --> 00:21:39,828
and keeps us together.

177
00:21:39,853 --> 00:21:43,602
- So we finally be real sisters.
- With good loving parents.

178
00:21:43,627 --> 00:21:46,195
That hate homework
as much as we do.

179
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:50,380
But, even if they don't,
that's okay too.

180
00:21:50,816 --> 00:21:52,496
Amen.

181
00:22:40,426 --> 00:22:42,744
Find me

182
00:23:19,849 --> 00:23:21,341
in here

183
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:32,421
Nancy.

184
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:34,913
Carol.

185
00:23:35,687 --> 00:23:37,773
Are you guys in here?

186
00:23:41,877 --> 00:23:46,456
Forgive me, Father,
for I am about to sin.

187
00:30:26,863 --> 00:30:30,233
I bet this is where
Mr Mullins keeps his wife.

188
00:30:30,631 --> 00:30:32,282
Does she really wear a mask?

189
00:30:32,307 --> 00:30:34,545
Yeah, she look like a doll.

190
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:37,599
Mrs Mullins?

191
00:30:37,783 --> 00:30:39,131
You down there?

192
00:30:39,156 --> 00:30:40,381
Stop it.

193
00:30:41,145 --> 00:30:43,123
I think he seems nice.

194
00:30:43,378 --> 00:30:46,226
Why don't you go find Janice,
see what she's up to.

195
00:30:46,251 --> 00:30:47,345
Why?

196
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:49,192
So you can talk about boys.

197
00:30:49,217 --> 00:30:51,786
Well, do you want to
talk about boys?

198
00:30:51,998 --> 00:30:54,689
Gross.
No.

199
00:30:54,846 --> 00:30:56,198
I wanna play a game.

200
00:30:56,223 --> 00:30:57,551
Okay.

201
00:30:57,576 --> 00:30:59,060
Let's play hide and seek.

202
00:30:59,085 --> 00:31:01,460
You go hide and
we'll come look for you.

203
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:02,826
Okay.

204
00:31:08,122 --> 00:31:11,028
So, are we going to
look for her?

205
00:31:11,309 --> 00:31:12,790
Maybe.

206
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:20,361
Bless you.

207
00:31:20,386 --> 00:31:21,723
Thank you.

208
00:31:22,474 --> 00:31:23,920
What are you doing?

209
00:31:23,945 --> 00:31:27,245
I asked Mr Mullins if we could use
this room for our new classroom

210
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:29,579
and he graciously agreed.

211
00:31:29,675 --> 00:31:31,443
Would you like to help?

212
00:31:33,646 --> 00:31:35,190
What's wrong?

213
00:31:36,582 --> 00:31:38,918
I have a sin to confess.

214
00:31:40,609 --> 00:31:43,444
Forgive me, sister Charlotte,
for I have sinned.

215
00:31:44,224 --> 00:31:47,162
-  It's been...
- At least 2 weeks.

216
00:31:48,251 --> 00:31:50,734
... at least 2 weeks
since my last confession.

217
00:31:52,973 --> 00:31:55,365
There's this room upstairs
I'm not suppose to go into.

218
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:57,105
But you did anyway.

219
00:31:58,079 --> 00:31:59,295
How did you know?

220
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,673
Because otherwise why would
you be telling me about it.

221
00:32:04,404 --> 00:32:07,115
Well, the door was already opened.

222
00:32:07,834 --> 00:32:11,382
I don't know how because
Mr Mullins always keeps it locked.

223
00:32:12,052 --> 00:32:14,267
When I went inside
there was this little doll.

224
00:32:14,292 --> 00:32:16,497
- And it was really strange.
- Janice.

225
00:32:16,738 --> 00:32:18,344
Weird things started to happen.

226
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:20,852
Janice, listen to yourself.

227
00:32:22,127 --> 00:32:24,487
What do I always say?

228
00:32:25,385 --> 00:32:28,691
A sin is a sin
no matter the context.

229
00:32:29,817 --> 00:32:34,237
More importantly, you absolutely
cannot disobey the Mullins.

230
00:32:35,648 --> 00:32:38,560
We only just got here and
they're doing a very generous thing

231
00:32:38,593 --> 00:32:40,995
by allowing us
to stay with them.

232
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:45,379
If they decide to
no longer have us here

233
00:32:45,404 --> 00:32:47,245
we'll all be split up.

234
00:32:47,687 --> 00:32:50,967
So next time you're thinking
of breaking a rule,

235
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:55,674
think of how that could've affect
the other girls first.

236
00:32:57,771 --> 00:32:59,034
Do you understand me?

237
00:32:59,059 --> 00:33:00,988
Yes.
I'm sorry, sister, I wasn't thinking.

238
00:33:01,013 --> 00:33:02,499
It's okay, love.

239
00:33:04,954 --> 00:33:07,982
For your penance,
pray 1 Hail Mary

240
00:33:08,163 --> 00:33:11,375
and unpack 3 of these boxes.

241
00:33:16,255 --> 00:33:17,933
What are you guys doing?

242
00:33:18,896 --> 00:33:20,781
Unpacking boxes.

243
00:33:21,145 --> 00:33:22,333
Oh.

244
00:34:09,572 --> 00:34:11,588
This place is so creepy.

245
00:34:25,356 --> 00:34:26,769
What was that?

246
00:34:32,202 --> 00:34:33,818
What was that?

247
00:34:39,942 --> 00:34:42,019
How dare you!

248
00:34:45,474 --> 00:34:47,647
Oh, Mr Scarecrow.

249
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:59,695
Oh.

250
00:36:00,689 --> 00:36:02,146
Found you.

251
00:36:02,684 --> 00:36:04,887
You're not very good at hiding.

252
00:36:10,327 --> 00:36:13,559
Years of neglect have
affected the counter balance.

253
00:36:13,893 --> 00:36:16,480
There.
That should keep the draft out.

254
00:36:16,505 --> 00:36:17,955
Thank you.

255
00:36:26,938 --> 00:36:28,879
Those taken in Romania.

256
00:36:28,904 --> 00:36:31,197
At a convent of cloistered nuns.

257
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:33,006
They have little contact
with the outside world

258
00:36:33,031 --> 00:36:35,879
but I became very close
to these three.

259
00:36:35,904 --> 00:36:39,151
That's sister Maria.
That's sister Anna.

260
00:36:39,176 --> 00:36:41,209
And that's sister Lucia.

261
00:36:42,722 --> 00:36:44,403
Who's this?

262
00:36:44,889 --> 00:36:45,925
!! Valak !!

263
00:36:47,172 --> 00:36:50,097
I... don't know.
I don't think I even met her.

264
00:36:53,118 --> 00:36:54,959
Is there anything else you need?

265
00:36:54,984 --> 00:36:56,603
No.
Thank you.

266
00:37:00,649 --> 00:37:02,044
Good night.

267
00:37:04,497 --> 00:37:05,926
Good night.

268
00:37:09,127 --> 00:37:10,925
Uuu.
I like him.

269
00:37:11,165 --> 00:37:12,935
Which one would you marry?

270
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,627
Oh.
I don't know.

271
00:37:14,652 --> 00:37:17,661
I guess I'll just have to date
all of them to find out.

272
00:37:18,446 --> 00:37:19,856
This is Ira.

273
00:37:20,633 --> 00:37:22,710
- His eye.
- He's very handsome.

274
00:37:47,631 --> 00:37:51,193
Night time is when Mrs Mullins
gets her powers.

275
00:37:51,218 --> 00:37:53,780
That's why she's in bed all day.
But at night...

276
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:55,776
she can go wherever she wants.

277
00:37:55,801 --> 00:37:59,384
She needs to
so she can feed.

278
00:37:59,597 --> 00:38:02,142
And if you look directly
at her you'll die.

279
00:38:02,167 --> 00:38:04,284
And to get you to look,
she'll keep saying your name

280
00:38:04,309 --> 00:38:09,059
over and over
till you can't stand it!

281
00:38:11,218 --> 00:38:14,421
Nancy.
Nancy.

282
00:38:14,446 --> 00:38:16,810
- Nancy...
- No. No.

283
00:38:16,835 --> 00:38:18,088
Nancy.

284
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,516
Oh.

285
00:38:37,141 --> 00:38:38,959
She's ready to feed.

286
00:38:39,598 --> 00:38:42,443
Carol.
Carol.

287
00:38:42,468 --> 00:38:43,494
Carol.

288
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:44,860
Hey, we're not suppose to be up.

289
00:38:44,885 --> 00:38:47,152
- Well, you'll do it to.
- Hey.

290
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:58,444
Why isn't he answering her?

291
00:39:29,338 --> 00:39:31,221
- It's her.
- Don't look at her.

292
00:39:31,522 --> 00:39:32,444
No!

293
00:39:32,469 --> 00:39:35,764
Please please please...

294
00:39:36,182 --> 00:39:37,366
Please.

295
00:39:39,383 --> 00:39:40,488
Please.

296
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,257
She's gone.

297
00:39:51,579 --> 00:39:52,995
She's gone.

298
00:39:56,753 --> 00:39:58,329
What's going on?

299
00:39:58,354 --> 00:39:59,604
What on god's earth?

300
00:39:59,629 --> 00:40:01,077
- Sister Charlotte.
- Mrs Mullins.

301
00:40:01,102 --> 00:40:02,160
She was here.
We heard.

302
00:40:02,185 --> 00:40:04,486
In this room,
she was sitting right over there.

303
00:40:04,511 --> 00:40:05,749
Who?

304
00:40:06,798 --> 00:40:08,493
Your wife apparently.

305
00:40:08,518 --> 00:40:10,239
They said she was
just in here.

306
00:40:10,264 --> 00:40:11,873
Oh, that's impossible.

307
00:40:11,898 --> 00:40:15,015
My wife hasn't been
able to walk for years.

308
00:40:38,071 --> 00:40:40,394
Girls.
Girls.

309
00:40:41,578 --> 00:40:44,159
Let's go back to our studies, okay?

310
00:40:57,302 --> 00:40:59,207
You okay, Nance?

311
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,998
Did you really see Mrs Mullins
in your room last night?

312
00:41:13,023 --> 00:41:14,846
Yes.
We swear we were under the cover and...

313
00:41:14,871 --> 00:41:16,887
Nancy.
Stop it.

314
00:41:16,912 --> 00:41:19,961
We just freaked ourselves out
last night, you know that.

315
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:37,748
Mrs Mullins?

316
00:41:38,317 --> 00:41:40,183
Sister Charlotte.

317
00:41:40,294 --> 00:41:43,379
Could I trouble you
for a glass of water?

318
00:41:43,404 --> 00:41:44,974
Of course.

319
00:42:20,405 --> 00:42:22,829
It's good to hear
some life again.

320
00:42:23,609 --> 00:42:28,300
I've been cooped up here so long
I forgotten what that sounded like.

321
00:42:30,224 --> 00:42:32,197
What a lovely picture.

322
00:42:32,222 --> 00:42:34,242
She was taken from us

323
00:42:34,267 --> 00:42:37,309
at an early age... unfortunately.

324
00:42:38,998 --> 00:42:41,689
If you could turn away
for a moment, sister.

325
00:42:41,714 --> 00:42:43,160
Yes, of course.

326
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:48,320
I'm very sorry to hear
about your daughter.

327
00:42:50,547 --> 00:42:54,785
But we find comfort in knowing
she waits for you in heaven.

328
00:42:55,249 --> 00:42:57,572
I wish that were true.

329
00:44:49,557 --> 00:44:51,834
Oh my gosh.

330
00:44:52,959 --> 00:44:55,202
You shouldn't be in here.

331
00:44:55,344 --> 00:44:57,333
Well, neither should you.

332
00:45:08,442 --> 00:45:10,512
Who's room is this anyways?

333
00:45:10,537 --> 00:45:12,452
The Mullins had a daughter.

334
00:45:12,477 --> 00:45:14,132
It was her's.

335
00:45:16,414 --> 00:45:17,976
Had one?

336
00:45:18,597 --> 00:45:20,541
I think she died.

337
00:45:23,024 --> 00:45:25,832
And I think that was her
playing the music too.

338
00:45:31,175 --> 00:45:33,009
Stop trying to scare me.

339
00:45:33,034 --> 00:45:34,924
I'm not.
It's the truth.

340
00:45:34,949 --> 00:45:36,884
Then why are we in here.

341
00:45:36,909 --> 00:45:38,843
- We should leave.
- No.

342
00:45:39,573 --> 00:45:40,673
Oh.

343
00:45:52,549 --> 00:45:53,912
Linda.

344
00:45:54,356 --> 00:45:55,743
What is it?

345
00:45:57,315 --> 00:45:59,312
We shouldn't be in here.

346
00:46:01,262 --> 00:46:02,546
Okay.

347
00:46:03,771 --> 00:46:05,519
I'll leave in a minute.

348
00:46:05,544 --> 00:46:07,101
Well, I'm going.

349
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:41,635
Dear Diary, today I came home

350
00:47:16,147 --> 00:47:17,565
Who's doing that?

351
00:48:08,753 --> 00:48:10,051
Hi.

352
00:48:24,076 --> 00:48:27,263
You're the Mullins' daughter...
aren't you?

353
00:48:29,777 --> 00:48:31,950
What happened to you?

354
00:48:32,246 --> 00:48:34,140
Will you help me?

355
00:48:37,093 --> 00:48:38,871
What do you need?

356
00:48:42,381 --> 00:48:44,695
YOUR SOUL!

357
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:07,261
Charlotte!

358
00:49:07,286 --> 00:49:09,416
Sister Charlotte!

359
00:50:20,681 --> 00:50:21,889
No.

360
00:52:23,965 --> 00:52:25,705
How do you feel?

361
00:52:26,854 --> 00:52:28,568
Give her some space.

362
00:52:32,854 --> 00:52:34,271
Girls.

363
00:52:35,358 --> 00:52:37,102
Janice is feeling
a little down right now.

364
00:52:37,127 --> 00:52:40,020
So, we need to do
what we can to support her.

365
00:52:40,568 --> 00:52:43,228
Time I think
is all she needs.

366
00:52:43,611 --> 00:52:46,652
She'll walk again, right?

367
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:49,271
We'll have to see.

368
00:52:51,081 --> 00:52:52,413
You need sleep.

369
00:52:52,438 --> 00:52:55,002
That's going to help you
with the healing.

370
00:52:55,401 --> 00:52:57,887
I can't stay here, sister Charlotte.

371
00:52:58,764 --> 00:53:00,583
We can't stay here.

372
00:53:00,608 --> 00:53:02,274
We need to leave.

373
00:53:02,389 --> 00:53:03,724
Leave.

374
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:05,457
And go where?

375
00:53:08,191 --> 00:53:10,887
There isn't anywhere else
for us to go.

376
00:53:11,672 --> 00:53:14,510
I didn't fall down those stairs.

377
00:53:15,247 --> 00:53:17,226
Something threw me.

378
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:19,537
What do you mean?

379
00:53:22,129 --> 00:53:23,959
You always say that

380
00:53:24,166 --> 00:53:27,043
even though we can't see god
we can...

381
00:53:27,068 --> 00:53:29,314
we can feel his presence.

382
00:53:29,977 --> 00:53:31,334
Well...

383
00:53:31,781 --> 00:53:35,729
in this house I feel
a different kind of presence.

384
00:53:35,934 --> 00:53:37,483
What kind?

385
00:53:41,622 --> 00:53:43,574
An evil one.

386
00:53:43,708 --> 00:53:45,697
It's coming after me.

387
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:47,140
Coming after my soul.

388
00:53:47,165 --> 00:53:48,677
You soul.

389
00:53:48,702 --> 00:53:50,778
Because I'm the weakest.

390
00:53:50,803 --> 00:53:52,528
No, darling.

391
00:53:52,845 --> 00:53:54,142
Listen.

392
00:53:54,321 --> 00:53:57,036
The devil preys on
those weak in faith,

393
00:53:57,061 --> 00:53:59,484
not weak of flesh and bone.

394
00:53:59,739 --> 00:54:03,325
You are as strong
as any of us, Janice.

395
00:54:04,635 --> 00:54:06,213
Stronger.

396
00:54:22,896 --> 00:54:25,240
You're quiet, Samuel.

397
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:28,525
I think it was a mistake...

398
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,350
to bring the girls here.

399
00:54:32,526 --> 00:54:34,003
Why?

400
00:54:36,321 --> 00:54:38,008
The girl ...

401
00:54:38,432 --> 00:54:40,107
The girl who fell.

402
00:54:41,474 --> 00:54:43,442
Maybe she didn't fall.

403
00:54:44,075 --> 00:54:45,608
Maybe...

404
00:54:46,355 --> 00:54:48,194
It was an accident.

405
00:54:48,993 --> 00:54:50,761
That's all it was.

406
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:53,068
Accidents happen.

407
00:54:57,363 --> 00:55:00,595
It's been quiet for 12 years.

408
00:55:02,263 --> 00:55:05,843
You should try embracing
the presence of the girls...

409
00:55:06,393 --> 00:55:09,056
instead of frightening them away.

410
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:15,536
You'll be better soon.

411
00:55:15,561 --> 00:55:17,538
I don't think so.

412
00:55:19,462 --> 00:55:21,178
Not this time.

413
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:23,446
But you have too.

414
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,219
You said we'll find
a new home.

415
00:55:28,238 --> 00:55:30,637
No one is going to
want me now.

416
00:55:30,662 --> 00:55:32,729
I'll just be a burden.

417
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:36,531
But you swore we'll stay together.

418
00:55:37,078 --> 00:55:38,845
I take it back.

419
00:55:42,379 --> 00:55:44,965
Maybe I won't get adopted.

420
00:55:49,235 --> 00:55:50,806
You will.

421
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,579
You know why?

422
00:55:53,305 --> 00:55:55,291
Because you're special.

423
00:55:56,862 --> 00:56:01,714
You're going to get adopted by
a nice family somewhere

424
00:56:01,739 --> 00:56:04,404
and they're going to
spoil you so much.

425
00:56:04,981 --> 00:56:06,836
You're going to have
so many dolls that...

426
00:56:06,861 --> 00:56:09,170
you won't even be able to
name all of them.

427
00:56:09,195 --> 00:56:10,827
Sure I can.

428
00:56:10,852 --> 00:56:12,517
Janice one.

429
00:56:12,542 --> 00:56:14,922
Janice Two.
Janice Three.

430
00:56:16,464 --> 00:56:19,832
Linda.
Time for bed.

431
00:56:21,994 --> 00:56:24,515
Won't you come upstairs?

432
00:56:25,428 --> 00:56:27,513
I don't want to sleep alone.

433
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:30,822
Here.

434
00:56:31,909 --> 00:56:33,576
Take Becca.

435
00:56:33,972 --> 00:56:35,579
This way,

436
00:56:36,398 --> 00:56:38,183
I'll always be with you.

437
00:56:41,454 --> 00:56:44,540
Then, you should have Sweet Sue.

438
00:56:46,454 --> 00:56:47,991
Thank you.

439
00:56:51,776 --> 00:56:54,461
Remember before
all of this.

440
00:56:54,781 --> 00:56:58,754
When we used to sneak around
the orphanage at night,

441
00:56:59,034 --> 00:57:01,732
And ate all the chocolate
of the pantry.

442
00:57:01,777 --> 00:57:05,617
Father Massey was convinced
that we had mice.

443
00:57:06,525 --> 00:57:11,260
Oh lord, please cleanse
my soul of my sins

444
00:57:11,285 --> 00:57:13,921
and cleanse our house of...

445
00:57:13,946 --> 00:57:16,146
- these mice.
- these mice.

446
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:25,102
Whatever happens

447
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:30,015
I was thinking always
all those things we did together.

448
00:57:32,771 --> 00:57:34,352
Good night, Linda.

449
00:57:34,839 --> 00:57:36,502
Good night, Jan.

450
01:02:35,848 --> 01:02:38,485
A little sunlight will
do you some good.

451
01:02:38,651 --> 01:02:41,699
I don't the sunlight can fix
what's wrong with me.

452
01:02:42,949 --> 01:02:45,303
You mustn't give up hope.

453
01:02:46,856 --> 01:02:49,355
Hope is a home onto itself.

454
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:52,276
Dwell in it and it will
protect and keep you.

455
01:02:54,261 --> 01:02:56,482
What book of the bible
is that from?

456
01:02:58,660 --> 01:03:00,299
The book of Charlotte.

457
01:03:01,201 --> 01:03:03,638
But that doesn't
make it any less so.

458
01:03:05,328 --> 01:03:06,925
Are you okay here?

459
01:03:08,654 --> 01:03:10,809
The sunlight actually
feels kind of nice.

460
01:03:10,834 --> 01:03:12,486
I told you.

461
01:03:50,064 --> 01:03:51,704
Sister Charlotte?

462
01:03:58,185 --> 01:03:59,704
No, no, no!

463
01:04:00,346 --> 01:04:02,744
GOD HELP ME!

464
01:05:37,090 --> 01:05:38,357
Janice!

465
01:05:41,399 --> 01:05:42,626
Janice!

466
01:05:45,035 --> 01:05:46,329
What's going on?

467
01:05:49,303 --> 01:05:50,887
I couldn't get out.

468
01:05:50,954 --> 01:05:52,622
Are you okay?

469
01:05:56,536 --> 01:05:58,049
I'm fine.

470
01:06:04,850 --> 01:06:06,970
I'm worry about Janice.

471
01:06:07,774 --> 01:06:09,844
A few nights ago
she wanted to leave.

472
01:06:09,869 --> 01:06:11,365
Why she want to leave?

473
01:06:11,390 --> 01:06:14,237
Probably because this place
is off the wall.

474
01:06:14,404 --> 01:06:17,895
She told me the Mullins's daughter
was coming for her.

475
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:20,296
The Mullins' had a daughter?

476
01:06:20,748 --> 01:06:23,010
She died a long time ago.

477
01:06:23,487 --> 01:06:25,673
So, she's seeing ghost?

478
01:06:27,351 --> 01:06:29,107
Keep your voice down.

479
01:06:29,455 --> 01:06:31,564
So, she's seeing ghost?

480
01:06:32,192 --> 01:06:33,665
I guess.

481
01:06:34,143 --> 01:06:37,071
Well...
You guys saw something.

482
01:06:37,458 --> 01:06:39,023
That wasn't a ghost.

483
01:06:39,048 --> 01:06:41,427
Ghost can only be
of dead people.

484
01:06:42,246 --> 01:06:44,560
How does that explain
what you saw?

485
01:06:44,737 --> 01:06:47,315
Unless it really was Mrs Mullins.

486
01:06:48,481 --> 01:06:52,859
Or...
something was just trying to scare you.

487
01:06:53,698 --> 01:06:56,370
You guys are doing a good job
with that on your own.

488
01:07:01,001 --> 01:07:05,236
Janice is probably just looking for ways
to justify us treating her differently.

489
01:07:06,012 --> 01:07:07,613
I don't think so.

490
01:07:07,638 --> 01:07:08,954
Of course you don't.

491
01:07:08,979 --> 01:07:11,028
You'll know what I mean
when you're older.

492
01:07:11,321 --> 01:07:12,987
Now go get to bed.

493
01:07:47,973 --> 01:07:49,657
What are you waiting for?

494
01:07:49,913 --> 01:07:51,295
Nothing.

495
01:07:55,697 --> 01:07:57,154
You like it?

496
01:07:57,882 --> 01:07:59,347
It's nice.

497
01:08:04,014 --> 01:08:06,054
It's not my finest work.

498
01:08:17,001 --> 01:08:18,655
You seem troubled.

499
01:08:19,615 --> 01:08:21,043
Maybe I can help.

500
01:08:22,622 --> 01:08:24,271
I don't think so.

501
01:08:24,501 --> 01:08:27,736
Talking about the things
that bothers us sometimes...

502
01:08:28,685 --> 01:08:30,549
all the help we need.

503
01:08:31,858 --> 01:08:33,106
Well.

504
01:08:35,110 --> 01:08:36,940
It's Janice.

505
01:08:37,050 --> 01:08:39,078
She's acting funny.

506
01:08:40,338 --> 01:08:41,984
Acting funny?

507
01:08:43,221 --> 01:08:44,861
She says...

508
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:49,083
she's seen your daughter.

509
01:08:51,469 --> 01:08:53,011
My daughter...

510
01:08:55,753 --> 01:08:58,817
has been dead for a
very very long time

511
01:09:01,243 --> 01:09:02,716
I know, but...

512
01:09:03,272 --> 01:09:06,651
You see,
Janice went into her bedroom.

513
01:09:06,676 --> 01:09:07,844
She what?

514
01:09:08,736 --> 01:09:11,571
She knows she wasn't suppose to
but...

515
01:09:11,596 --> 01:09:14,594
- she found this doll and...
- What doll?

516
01:09:15,398 --> 01:09:16,959
The one in the white dress.

517
01:09:16,984 --> 01:09:18,564
That's impossible!

518
01:09:18,589 --> 01:09:20,590
That doll was hidden away.

519
01:09:20,615 --> 01:09:22,502
She mustn't go near that doll!

520
01:09:22,527 --> 01:09:24,044
You understand me?

521
01:10:38,155 --> 01:10:39,655
Found you

522
01:10:51,495 --> 01:10:53,975
Janice, I told you
not to use that room.

523
01:10:54,529 --> 01:11:00,424
Please don't take
my sunshine away...

524
01:11:38,178 --> 01:11:40,018
Ahhh!

525
01:11:40,356 --> 01:11:41,719
Stay here.

526
01:11:43,958 --> 01:11:45,453
Mr Mullins.

527
01:11:51,253 --> 01:11:53,358
Mr Mullins, are you okay?

528
01:12:12,027 --> 01:12:14,100
Go get ready for bed, girls.

529
01:12:14,125 --> 01:12:16,316
I need to speak to Mrs Mullins.

530
01:15:25,825 --> 01:15:28,659
Linda.
What are you doing?

531
01:15:29,193 --> 01:15:30,508
This doll.

532
01:15:30,533 --> 01:15:33,457
It's hurting Janice
and it killed Mr Mullins.

533
01:15:33,773 --> 01:15:35,417
I'm getting rid of it.

534
01:15:42,623 --> 01:15:44,463
Linda, let's go back.

535
01:15:59,482 --> 01:16:00,738
Linda?

536
01:16:07,817 --> 01:16:09,206
No!

537
01:16:27,466 --> 01:16:28,396
What is that?

538
01:16:28,421 --> 01:16:30,299
Who cares!
Run!

539
01:16:40,095 --> 01:16:42,677
Janice. Janice.
I got rid of it.

540
01:16:42,702 --> 01:16:44,632
I got rid of the doll.

541
01:16:47,614 --> 01:16:48,976
Janice.

542
01:16:49,035 --> 01:16:50,156
Janice.

543
01:16:50,436 --> 01:16:52,264
- What's going on?
- Where is Janice?

544
01:16:52,289 --> 01:16:54,320
- I don't know.
- Go find her.

545
01:16:54,465 --> 01:16:55,639
Hurry!

546
01:17:01,303 --> 01:17:02,461
What's going on?

547
01:17:02,486 --> 01:17:03,435
No!

548
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:05,538
No!
Get that thing away from me!

549
01:17:08,502 --> 01:17:09,789
It's back.

550
01:17:10,065 --> 01:17:11,943
I know it was back.

551
01:17:12,090 --> 01:17:13,576
What is it?

552
01:17:14,914 --> 01:17:16,176
Evil.

553
01:17:17,135 --> 01:17:19,162
The devil itself.

554
01:17:20,210 --> 01:17:21,774
What are you talking about?

555
01:17:23,031 --> 01:17:26,531
After Samuel and I...
lost our daughter

556
01:17:27,009 --> 01:17:30,366
we prayed and promised
our devotion to

557
01:17:30,391 --> 01:17:32,722
whatever power that
would allow us to

558
01:17:32,833 --> 01:17:36,614
speak or see our
beloved girl again.

559
01:17:37,641 --> 01:17:40,549
It started small,
the contact.

560
01:17:46,379 --> 01:17:47,952
But it was her.

561
01:17:48,531 --> 01:17:50,128
Our busy Bee.

562
01:17:50,517 --> 01:17:52,217
We know it was her.

563
01:17:53,875 --> 01:17:56,592
She wanted permission
to move into the doll

564
01:17:56,617 --> 01:17:59,053
so she could be
with us forever.

565
01:18:10,266 --> 01:18:11,785
please

566
01:18:11,817 --> 01:18:13,525
We said yes.

567
01:18:13,621 --> 01:18:16,484
And that's when it became stronger.

568
01:18:19,542 --> 01:18:21,922
Soon we can actually see her.

569
01:18:22,667 --> 01:18:26,029
Only in fleeting glimpses
but that was enough.

570
01:18:27,304 --> 01:18:29,223
Our beloved Bee.

571
01:18:29,769 --> 01:18:31,110
Our darling.

572
01:18:31,433 --> 01:18:33,014
Annabelle?

573
01:18:41,198 --> 01:18:43,355
Even though I couldn't hold her.

574
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:47,339
It was comforting to start
the past activity again.

575
01:18:51,569 --> 01:18:55,429
But we soon realised
it wasn't our Annabelle at all.

576
01:19:05,253 --> 01:19:10,802
You are my sunshine,
my only sunshine

577
01:19:11,499 --> 01:19:13,888
You make me happy ...

578
01:19:14,870 --> 01:19:17,051
when skies are gray

579
01:19:18,566 --> 01:19:21,056
You'll never know dear,

580
01:19:21,529 --> 01:19:23,946
how much I love you

581
01:19:24,771 --> 01:19:30,342
Please don't take my sunshine away

582
01:19:57,891 --> 01:19:59,170
Esther?

583
01:20:00,064 --> 01:20:01,324
Esther.

584
01:20:06,042 --> 01:20:08,449
My... eye...

585
01:20:13,951 --> 01:20:16,151
It was a demonic presence.

586
01:20:16,176 --> 01:20:18,812
And it was using our
Annabelle to manipulate us

587
01:20:18,837 --> 01:20:21,521
into giving it soul
it couldn't have.

588
01:20:21,546 --> 01:20:23,448
It tried to take mine.

589
01:20:23,614 --> 01:20:26,290
Then Samuel reached out
to the church.

590
01:20:27,267 --> 01:20:28,835
They saved my soul

591
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:32,088
but the evil was still
attached to that doll.

592
01:20:33,339 --> 01:20:35,495
So we locked it away

593
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:38,700
where it could be surrounded
by the word of god.

594
01:21:22,938 --> 01:21:25,974
It was quiet
for all these year.

595
01:21:26,243 --> 01:21:28,686
I thought the evil was contained.

596
01:21:30,047 --> 01:21:33,277
We thought helping the girls
could be our penance.

597
01:21:33,672 --> 01:21:36,883
But we end up giving it
just what it wanted.

598
01:21:37,092 --> 01:21:41,732
You are my sunshine,
my only sunshine

599
01:21:41,757 --> 01:21:46,079
You make me happy
when skies are gray

600
01:21:48,010 --> 01:21:50,470
- You'll never know dear,
- Janice.

601
01:21:50,495 --> 01:21:52,804
how much I love you

602
01:21:53,183 --> 01:21:56,859
Please don't take my sunshine away

603
01:21:56,884 --> 01:21:58,419
She can walk.

604
01:21:58,876 --> 01:22:00,834
It's just us, Janice.

605
01:22:02,073 --> 01:22:04,388
Time to cease from sin, Carol.

606
01:22:11,108 --> 01:22:12,827
Sister Charlotte!
Sister Charlotte!

607
01:22:12,852 --> 01:22:14,170
It's-It's Janice.

608
01:22:14,233 --> 01:22:15,963
- She's... She's...
- Look what she did!

609
01:22:15,988 --> 01:22:17,757
- Carol, call for help.
- Okay.

610
01:22:17,782 --> 01:22:19,855
- And stay together.
- Okay.

611
01:22:24,907 --> 01:22:27,396
They're on their way.
Let get somewhere safe.

612
01:22:31,878 --> 01:22:33,230
What do we do?

613
01:22:33,255 --> 01:22:35,900
We can't just leave her here,
can we?

614
01:22:47,694 --> 01:22:49,254
Mrs Mullins?

615
01:22:51,865 --> 01:22:53,375
Mrs Mullins?

616
01:22:55,315 --> 01:22:56,902
Mrs Mullins?

617
01:23:15,140 --> 01:23:16,426
Girls.

618
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,945
Let's go.
Now.

619
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:26,391
Forgive me, sister,
for I have sinned.

620
01:23:56,555 --> 01:23:58,462
- Sister Charlotte!
- Run. Come on!

621
01:24:02,374 --> 01:24:03,872
Linda!

622
01:24:05,973 --> 01:24:08,245
Go, Tierney!
Get help!

623
01:24:08,550 --> 01:24:09,943
Or...

624
01:24:10,613 --> 01:24:12,294
... you can help me.

625
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:26,101
The truck!

626
01:24:27,464 --> 01:24:29,340
Come on.
Come on.

627
01:24:31,140 --> 01:24:33,504
Close the door! Close the door!
Come on!

628
01:24:33,529 --> 01:24:35,362
Go!
Go.

629
01:24:41,597 --> 01:24:43,517
No!
No!

630
01:24:47,272 --> 01:24:48,485
Okay.

631
01:24:50,299 --> 01:24:51,850
No!

632
01:24:52,070 --> 01:24:53,795
I'm trying!

633
01:25:03,831 --> 01:25:05,051
Guys!

634
01:25:08,455 --> 01:25:10,778
- Guys! Guys!
- What? What?

635
01:25:11,476 --> 01:25:12,825
The scarecrow.

636
01:25:12,850 --> 01:25:14,639
What scarecrow?

637
01:25:20,126 --> 01:25:21,353
Get out!

638
01:25:40,950 --> 01:25:42,717
Come on!
Run!

639
01:25:48,169 --> 01:25:49,449
Carol?

640
01:25:58,183 --> 01:26:00,905
Nancy, I can't Ge the door open.
Is it locked?

641
01:26:00,930 --> 01:26:02,887
Can you get it from your side?

642
01:26:04,088 --> 01:26:05,425
Girls.

643
01:26:06,340 --> 01:26:07,899
Nancy?

644
01:27:39,258 --> 01:27:40,216
No.

645
01:27:40,241 --> 01:27:41,513
No.
No.

646
01:29:01,494 --> 01:29:04,156
Lord, help me.
Lord, help.

647
01:29:04,181 --> 01:29:06,020
Help...

648
01:29:07,209 --> 01:29:08,593
Carol, it's me.

649
01:29:08,618 --> 01:29:10,059
It's just me.

650
01:29:10,673 --> 01:29:12,116
Now, come on.

651
01:31:23,672 --> 01:31:25,031
No.

652
01:31:37,327 --> 01:31:38,478
No!

653
01:31:40,718 --> 01:31:41,950
No!

654
01:32:59,090 --> 01:33:00,982
Sister Charlotte?

655
01:33:27,236 --> 01:33:30,349
You know what I like most
about Sweet Sue?

656
01:33:35,130 --> 01:33:37,580
She looks just like you.

657
01:34:14,932 --> 01:34:16,359
Linda?

658
01:34:17,802 --> 01:34:20,485
Where are you, Linda?

659
01:34:24,029 --> 01:34:25,535
Linda?

660
01:34:36,890 --> 01:34:41,129
Linda, I'm coming?

661
01:35:05,860 --> 01:35:07,266
Found you!

662
01:35:09,895 --> 01:35:12,155
You swore if I found a home
you'd come too.

663
01:35:12,180 --> 01:35:14,607
You know what they say
about breaking a swear.

664
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:16,312
You go straight to hell.

665
01:35:16,337 --> 01:35:17,489
 Janice!

666
01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:25,649
Forgive me.

667
01:35:26,595 --> 01:35:27,797
No!

668
01:35:29,542 --> 01:35:31,045
Let me out!

669
01:35:31,070 --> 01:35:32,670
Let me out!

670
01:35:33,294 --> 01:35:35,524
Let me out... !

671
01:36:16,956 --> 01:36:18,146
Go!

672
01:36:27,340 --> 01:36:29,651
- Sister Charlotte!
- Sister Charlotte!

673
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:09,896
Anything?

674
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:11,906
I'm afraid not.

675
01:38:12,343 --> 01:38:14,203
Still no sign of the girl.

676
01:38:14,413 --> 01:38:16,269
But at her age...

677
01:38:16,831 --> 01:38:18,661
how far could she'd gone?

678
01:38:20,990 --> 01:38:22,638
Don't worry.

679
01:38:23,340 --> 01:38:24,919
We'll find her.

680
01:38:31,981 --> 01:38:33,855
This house is blessed.

681
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:37,175
Whatever evil was here
is no longer.

682
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:39,512
But...

683
01:38:40,010 --> 01:38:41,540
The doll.

684
01:38:41,770 --> 01:38:44,591
It was a conduit
for the evil.

685
01:38:44,616 --> 01:38:46,816
That evil has moved on.

686
01:38:47,210 --> 01:38:49,477
Now the doll
is just a doll.

687
01:38:49,596 --> 01:38:50,909
So...

688
01:38:51,790 --> 01:38:53,770
... which one of you gets this?

689
01:39:19,266 --> 01:39:21,070
How are you holding up?

690
01:39:23,392 --> 01:39:25,049
I'm okay.

691
01:39:27,856 --> 01:39:31,432
You know, that wasn't Janice back there.
That was...

692
01:39:32,810 --> 01:39:34,548
... something else.

693
01:39:38,590 --> 01:39:40,023
I know.

694
01:40:18,012 --> 01:40:19,837
ST. JOACHIM
ORPHANAGE

695
01:40:19,862 --> 01:40:22,192
Hi there.
Welcome.

696
01:40:22,230 --> 01:40:24,260
Let's go right inside, shall we?

697
01:40:27,070 --> 01:40:29,875
She mostly keeps to herself,
that can be a bit quite.

698
01:40:29,900 --> 01:40:31,714
but she's a lovely girl.

699
01:40:31,739 --> 01:40:34,080
She's just been through a lot.

700
01:40:35,310 --> 01:40:37,370
I think you will love her.

701
01:40:40,040 --> 01:40:41,460
Hello.

702
01:40:41,857 --> 01:40:44,170
There's someone here to see you, sweetie.

703
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:50,613
I want to introduce you to
Mr and Mrs Higgins.

704
01:40:52,230 --> 01:40:54,775
And you must be...

705
01:40:54,886 --> 01:40:57,216
- Annabelle.
- Annabelle.

706
01:40:57,241 --> 01:40:59,228
What a lovely name.

707
01:41:00,362 --> 01:41:02,238
We brought you a present.

708
01:41:05,670 --> 01:41:07,640
I hope you like dolls.

709
01:41:36,258 --> 01:41:44,194
12 YEARS LATER

710
01:41:54,727 --> 01:41:56,466
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

711
01:41:56,491 --> 01:41:57,781
What is it?

712
01:41:57,926 --> 01:41:59,019
Stay here.

713
01:41:59,044 --> 01:42:00,487
No, no, no!
No, wait.

714
01:42:00,512 --> 01:42:01,672
It's okay.
It's alright, sweetheart.

715
01:42:01,697 --> 01:42:03,013
I'm just going to
take a quick look.

716
01:42:03,038 --> 01:42:04,741
Call the police.

717
01:42:18,626 --> 01:42:21,089
- Annabelle?
- Hi, Mom.

718
01:42:43,836 --> 01:42:45,219
John.

719
01:42:58,632 --> 01:43:04,694
