00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:47,700
Boss.

18
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:53,765
Boss, where have you been?
I've called you many times.

19
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:55,831
Let's go.

20
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:01,379
Is it true that you hit him?

21
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:03,615
He committed no violent act.
Please step aside.

22
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,451
Did your counterpart actor
really fall down the stairs?

23
00:03:05,486 --> 00:03:09,756
Please make a comment, Mr. Jang!

24
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,891
No, no!
Please step aside.

25
00:03:11,926 --> 00:03:13,991
Tell us what exactly happened.

26
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:19,566
Your face is what makes you money,
so stop spitting on it.

27
00:03:19,601 --> 00:03:22,660
Know how much it cost
to shut people up?

28
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:26,269
An article not going out
isn't the end.

29
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:30,439
If bad rumors get out,
people will turn on you.

30
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:35,148
We'd have to stop shooting
if Sung-min hadn't agreed to act.

31
00:03:35,183 --> 00:03:38,845
That's why I have you, right?

32
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,344
You despiteful bastard.

33
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,148
Who were you with this time?

34
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:49,421
Anyway, there weren't
that many reporters.

35
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:52,259
Is that all I'm worth?

36
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,098
We're not made for each other.

37
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,938
Watch how you drive, idiot.

38
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,964
You think an agent
only drives and takes calls?

39
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:05,437
This job isn't a hobby.
Put some heart into it.

40
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:13,714
If I add up all the shares,
it will come out 23.08%%%.

41
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,414
Why are you looking at me like that?

42
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:25,365
- 23.08%% %? Are you sure?
- What are you talking about?

43
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,559
Is what you're saying true?

44
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:30,036
Don't play around
with the Chairman's money.

45
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:32,537
I'm sorry.

46
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:35,006
You manage Sungwoo Development.

47
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:37,237
And I manage you.

48
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,036
Don't forget that.

49
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,460
- Step aside.
- Yes, sir.

50
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:08,074
- Hello, boss.
- Hello, sir.

51
00:05:08,109 --> 00:05:09,166
Hello, sir.

52
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,572
Where have I seen her before?

53
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:13,645
Is she a new girl?

54
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,308
Don't you know the actress,
Kang Mi-na?

55
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:19,886
- Actress?
- Yes, she's going to be in a new movie.

56
00:05:19,921 --> 00:05:21,786
She's with the director and actor now.

57
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,055
Actor Jang Soo-ta is inside.

58
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:27,121
Don't you like Soo-ta, sir?

59
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:30,530
- Shall I bring him here?
- Will he listen to you?

60
00:05:30,565 --> 00:05:31,496
Well...

61
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,431
Don't be stupid and just drink.

62
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:35,764
If I go,
I bet I could bring him here.

63
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:39,260
Then go.

64
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,975
- Sir?
- Go get his autograph.

65
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,639
Autograph?
I can get 10 autographs if you want.

66
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,010
He's a real man.

67
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:58,689
He told you to come in person.

68
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:00,816
I knew he'd fail.

69
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:03,689
Tell them to bring in the girls.

70
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,026
You go instead.

71
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:10,133
Sir?

72
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:14,140
Please stop, Mr. Bong.

73
00:06:14,175 --> 00:06:15,873
Like this.

74
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:18,294
Really aggressive,

75
00:06:18,329 --> 00:06:20,288
like a dog fight.

76
00:06:20,323 --> 00:06:22,213
Please stop Mr. Bong.

77
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:24,283
Then shall I hit him for real?

78
00:06:24,318 --> 00:06:25,511
That would be nice.

79
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:29,244
You take me too seriously.

80
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,817
I heard you know how to fight.

81
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,821
Is what the paper said true?

82
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:39,766
People said that he didn't just fall
down the stairs, but you had hit him.

83
00:06:39,801 --> 00:06:43,202
Then why'd you agree
to take this role?

84
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:48,035
To be honest, I don't care.

85
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,677
- You can't go inside.
- Move.

86
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:52,837
You're here again?

87
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:00,343
Sign this.

88
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:05,086
- Are you my fan?
- Not me.

89
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:08,594
Then tell him to come in person.

90
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:09,788
He's got no legs?

91
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:20,304
You're a fucking big shot.

92
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,612
He seemed to be a real gangster.
Shall we change rooms?

93
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:33,119
Why? Did we do something wrong?

94
00:07:33,154 --> 00:07:35,254
You sure do have diverse fans.

95
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:37,355
Just pick out the seeds, idiot.

96
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,395
Mr. Bong, I'm tired,
so I'll be going home now.

97
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,657
See you at the set.

98
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,732
Shall I go kick some ass?

99
00:07:48,767 --> 00:07:50,733
Kick whose ass, idiot?

100
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:55,066
- You just stay put.
- Yes, sir.

101
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,037
Mr. Bong, what are you doing?
Give it to me.

102
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:05,084
Leave it to me.
I'm an expert at this.

103
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:07,143
But you're drunk.

104
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,878
What's the meaning of this?

105
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,263
Wow.

106
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:26,764
You look exactly like you do
in the movies.

107
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,967
I've seen all your movies.

108
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,580
Please sign your autograph.

109
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,857
You must like movies a lot.

110
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:49,293
Well, I dreamed of becoming
an actor once.

111
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:52,463
But life had its up and downs.

112
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:54,796
- Actor?
- I played a role in a movie once.

113
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:57,736
An actor isn't for everyone.

114
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:00,961
Name?

115
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,065
Gang-pae.

116
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:07,071
Gang-pae?
Not 'Gang-ster'?

117
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,015
Why?

118
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:12,945
Is my name weird?

119
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:18,482
Why waste your short life like that?

120
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:24,830
Wouldn't it be embarrassing
to your kids later?

121
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:26,631
Watch your mouth.

122
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,499
Just because he jokes with you
doesn't mean you can joke back.

123
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:45,182
You got the appearance down.

124
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:50,047
But you should do it
in front of the camera.

125
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,990
Isn't acting all fake anyway?

126
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:03,636
Do you even know what acting is?

127
00:10:03,671 --> 00:10:05,436
What's there to it?

128
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:10,272
You get lucky in life
and then comfortably imitate people.

129
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:16,207
How about a handshake?

130
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:21,582
This place really sucks.

131
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,869
Soo-ta, you definitely have charisma.

132
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,465
I'm getting sober.

133
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:47,979
Those bastards talk tough,

134
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,641
but they're nothing
when it's one on one.

135
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:52,576
But I liked that guy's image.

136
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:03,029
You bastards,
who do you fucking think you are?

137
00:11:03,064 --> 00:11:03,928
What now?

138
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:06,431
Now that you're famous you think
you can do anything you want?

139
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,627
Don't laugh asshole.
Otherwise, I'll rip your jaw out.

140
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:11,566
Morons.

141
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,939
What did you say?

142
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:16,737
Leave before I call the police.

143
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:22,542
You guys need to get hit
to register things.

144
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:24,047
You bastard.

145
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:26,243
Screw this.

146
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:37,195
Ruining an actor's face
means the end for him.

147
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:40,626
But he kept...

148
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:17,599
That's why you hear people
call you trash.

149
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,440
Use this for your friend's
medical bills.

150
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,316
You don't trust a gangster's money?

151
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,102
Apologize.

152
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,377
- You fucking asshole!
- Wait!

153
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:05,151
- Please don't do this!
- Let go!

154
00:13:05,186 --> 00:13:06,118
Don't.

155
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:12,386
That was very real.

156
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:15,288
It sent chills down my spine.

157
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,433
We will escort you home, sir.

158
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:28,600
Boss, you don't trust us?

159
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:42,752
Hey.

160
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:44,386
Fucking idiot.

161
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:48,083
You think you're worth
talking to the boss?

162
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:11,008
'You rotten assholes! '

163
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:14,853
I'm not getting my lines right.

164
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:28,425
'That's why you hear people
call you trash. '

165
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:34,731
'That's why you hear people
call you trash! '

166
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,981
'Why waste your short life like that? '

167
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:31,030
I've collected what I could.

168
00:15:31,065 --> 00:15:34,124
What's your religion?

169
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:36,726
I don't have one.

170
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,776
Does it make sense
that you don't have a religion?

171
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:52,475
Tell me what you believe in.

172
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:55,450
I believe in you, Mr. Park.

173
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:05,186
I want Chairman Baek to get released
quickly more than anyone.

174
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:08,459
We've known each other
for a long time.

175
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:14,497
Please help us until the trial.

176
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:18,570
Take that with you.

177
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,241
You need to believe in something.

178
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:33,359
I've been troublesome
whenever you come visit.

179
00:16:33,394 --> 00:16:34,587
Not at all, sir.

180
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:36,827
Did you meet Mr. Park?

181
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:40,399
Yes, but I couldn't sound him out.

182
00:16:40,434 --> 00:16:42,866
Don't worry.

183
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:45,597
He doesn't have any concrete evidence.

184
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:48,638
- Is it my turn?
- Yes, sir.

185
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:53,971
Here.

186
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,012
Just do whatever he wants.

187
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,127
Money isn't the problem now.

188
00:17:08,162 --> 00:17:09,594
Yes, sir.

189
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:16,828
I caught this one.

190
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:24,610
Don't cause any trouble
until the trial.

191
00:17:24,645 --> 00:17:25,642
Yes, sir.

192
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:29,636
Don't trust your boys
too much, either.

193
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,577
I want to see your face.

194
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,938
Stop!

195
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:18,154
Are you crazy?

196
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:21,098
What if somebody sees us?

197
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:24,068
Are you that afraid
of someone seeing?

198
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,297
What's wrong with you?

199
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,910
I can't even see your face.
What is this?

200
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:34,807
You know how things are.

201
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:39,976
Have you thought about things
from my perspective?

202
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:48,149
I can't even have coffee with you
at a café like other couples.

203
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:53,747
Are you embarrassed of me?

204
00:18:53,782 --> 00:18:55,131
What are you talking about?

205
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,061
Come here. I missed you.

206
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:00,802
I'm not a prostitute.

207
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:04,499
It's been a year already.

208
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,442
I've been patient long enough.

209
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:10,206
So what do you want me
to do about it?

210
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:15,185
You know how much reporters
like to exaggerate rumors?

211
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,314
If your face gets out,
you'll never be able to get married.

212
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,091
Selfish bastard.

213
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:23,794
Don't be so indecent.

214
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:29,157
Isn't what we're doing more indecent?

215
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:31,870
Then just go.

216
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:10,475
Cut!

217
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,033
Damn!

218
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:17,648
Come on, that looked too fake.

219
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:21,720
How could you fall before he hits you?

220
00:20:21,755 --> 00:20:23,353
Then, Sung-min.

221
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:26,016
Your punches need to be closer
for it to look real.

222
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:31,096
Don't punch the air.
You need to aim accurately.

223
00:20:31,131 --> 00:20:32,791
Do it more realistically.

224
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,756
- Sound!
- Speed.

225
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:37,892
Camera!
Action!

226
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:49,472
Cut!
Are you okay?

227
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:51,646
God damn!

228
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:59,081
Sorry, I got too absorbed into it.

229
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:01,652
Let's do it again.

230
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:03,419
Ready!

231
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:06,055
Try to be careful.

232
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,989
Action!

233
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:20,876
Cut!

234
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:25,642
Are you okay?

235
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:28,553
Soo-ta, what's wrong?

236
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:29,611
Are you okay?

237
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:33,389
I must've been too nervous.

238
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:35,650
Let's not screw up this take.

239
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:39,180
- Let's go again.
- Okay.

240
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:41,064
Sorry, but don't get upset

241
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:44,403
whether you get hit once or twice.

242
00:21:44,438 --> 00:21:45,427
Step aside!

243
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:48,272
You'll lose weight if you keep this up.

244
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,009
For the sake of this movie,
nothing's a waste to me.

245
00:21:51,044 --> 00:21:53,043
Doesn't seem so wasteful to me.

246
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:55,911
It's not even your shoot today,
so why are you here?

247
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:01,146
Mi-na, do you like me by any chance?

248
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:04,721
Ready.

249
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:07,850
Don't mind the director.
Just don't overdo it.

250
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,321
I'm sorry.

251
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:13,064
Action!

252
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:28,937
I told you not to overdo it!

253
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:31,544
Yes, I like the expression.

254
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,889
Is it that hard not to overdo it?

255
00:22:42,924 --> 00:22:44,418
Don't you know what overdo means?

256
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:53,236
Hurry up!
Save him!

257
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:55,569
Get the first-aid kit!
No, call an ambulance!

258
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:04,015
How could you hit him for real?

259
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,277
This is a movie!

260
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:07,384
This is so frustrating.

261
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:11,285
Jang Soo-ta Assaults
Actor During Shoot!

262
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,460
No Visitors

263
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:27,403
Take care of yourself.
No, please don't get up.

264
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:35,001
You're lucky he didn't press charges.
What the hell's wrong with you?

265
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:37,872
I don't know, either.

266
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,410
There are a few reporters
and Sung-min's fans outside.

267
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:45,486
You call this a 'few'?

268
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:49,126
There he is!

269
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:50,727
Is the movie called off?

270
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,253
Please make a statement.
Was it deliberate?

271
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:58,536
Apologize! Apologize!

272
00:23:58,603 --> 00:23:59,770
How do you feel now?

273
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:03,989
I am deeply sorry for upsetting

274
00:24:04,024 --> 00:24:08,174
Sung-min and Sung-min's fans.

275
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:14,710
- Show your sincere apology!
- You trash!

276
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:22,759
Apologize! Apologize!

277
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:25,497
Fuck.
Which bitch threw the flour?

278
00:24:25,532 --> 00:24:27,522
Soo-ta! Soo-ta!

279
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:30,027
Please make a statement.

280
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:33,349
Apologize! Apologize!

281
00:24:33,384 --> 00:24:35,430
I won't apologize!

282
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:39,004
Edit that! Call me later!

283
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:47,284
Where are you going?

284
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,187
The meeting for the commercial shoot.

285
00:24:49,222 --> 00:24:50,984
Forget already?

286
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:54,488
You don't need to go today.

287
00:24:57,896 --> 00:24:58,863
Why not?

288
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:01,989
They changed the actor.

289
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:07,169
Wear a hat if you're going outside.

290
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:09,901
Did I commit some crime or something?

291
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:12,406
You ignorant bastard.

292
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,575
Hey, I told you to put on a hat.

293
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:34,021
You're lucky to be alive.

294
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:35,590
None.

295
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:38,594
No actor wants to join us.

296
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,699
Please don't take pictures.

297
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:50,814
People say that
you can't transform your acting.

298
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:55,186
They say you live out your characters,
but I disagree.

299
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:57,313
I think you have great potential.

300
00:25:58,023 --> 00:25:59,615
What bastard said that?

301
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:04,558
First time you've heard that?
Just ignore it.

302
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:08,199
I told you not to take pictures!

303
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:11,067
What an asshole.

304
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:13,554
Yeah, I'm an asshole, so what?

305
00:26:13,589 --> 00:26:15,972
Stop it or else he'll hit you.

306
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:19,773
Damn it, it took me six years
to prepare for this movie.

307
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:24,316
If I can finish this,
I'll dance naked in the street.

308
00:26:24,351 --> 00:26:26,316
Stay on schedule.

309
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:28,084
But I don't have an actor.

310
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:30,417
I'll promise to bring one
to you myself.

311
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:35,987
Delicious.

312
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:39,888
Fuck.

313
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:41,988
It's me.

314
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:47,133
Remember you said you wanted to be
in a movie with me before?

315
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,095
Yeah.

316
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:50,863
No?

317
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,544
It's no big deal.

318
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:57,047
Okay, talk to you later.

319
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:00,441
Son of a bitch!

320
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,751
I know he's not working,
so how could he be busy!

321
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:07,339
Bastard's gotten really big now.

322
00:27:07,374 --> 00:27:09,823
Yeah, see you later.
Goodbye.

323
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:13,428
There's no one to act.

324
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:22,030
Hey.

325
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:25,977
There's one actor.

326
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:26,966
Who?

327
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:35,387
Rumors have it that his acting
is always the same and he's pompous.

328
00:27:35,422 --> 00:27:37,014
He can't transform his acting.

329
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:40,357
He's always prone to beat up people.

330
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:43,725
What an asshole.
How can you act with a bastard like that?

331
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:48,390
Who do you think he is?

332
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:52,358
Never mind.

333
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:57,173
Just go buy some beer.

334
00:27:57,208 --> 00:28:00,075
But I don't have any money.

335
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:04,008
You broke bastard.

336
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:18,720
But this is a check.

337
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:28,197
Isn't this my money?

338
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,373
It's the money for my medical bills.

339
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:34,110
Have you lost your mind?

340
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:54,062
How'd you know my number?

341
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,084
You wrote it down for me.

342
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:58,601
You came to return that?

343
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:03,539
No, I changed my mind.

344
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,449
Want to act in a movie?

345
00:29:11,484 --> 00:29:12,348
Movie?

346
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:14,317
I thought you wanted to act in one.

347
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,883
Why? Now you don't?

348
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:22,057
It's a gangster movie
with some fight scenes between us.

349
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:26,030
I lose a few times at first,
but then I win later.

350
00:29:26,065 --> 00:29:28,699
Of course that's a given
since I'm the lead actor.

351
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:35,205
Do I look that free to you?

352
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:38,502
Forget it if you don't want to.

353
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,786
Is that convertible your car?

354
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:57,325
Convertible car?

355
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:01,059
Yes.
Is that important now?

356
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,231
Nice car.

357
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,231
You're getting a ticket.

358
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:09,137
What?

359
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:14,404
Does that bastard know how much
that windshield costs?

360
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,038
Take that ticket off, you bastard!

361
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:20,411
I told that asshole to stick
next to the car.

362
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:25,681
But why me,
when you have so many actors?

363
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,188
What?

364
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,955
The concept for this movie is realism.

365
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:38,799
What's the real reason?

366
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:44,907
I told you that
the movie's concept is realism.

367
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:57,312
I sent two actors to the hospital.

368
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,585
So no one wants to play against me.

369
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:09,732
You hit them for real?

370
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:19,975
Then how about we do it for real, too?

371
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:21,610
What?

372
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:25,782
Let's do the action scenes for real.

373
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,004
You can't shoot movies like that.

374
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:34,889
Then go if you're scared to do so.

375
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,528
Then...

376
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:43,366
Go with the script for the last scene.

377
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:48,404
Then all you need to do is win.

378
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,432
I can't fake things.

379
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,869
That's your expertise.

380
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:06,981
You're smart enough to
memorize the lines, right?

381
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:20,063
'Why waste your short life like that? '

382
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:22,597
'Wouldn't it be embarrassing... '

383
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:31,306
Wait, his lines were in the script.

384
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,110
Funny bastard.

385
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:39,586
Please step aside.
A little bit more.

386
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:48,531
Are you out of your mind?

387
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:51,296
You call this your promise?
Movies aren't a joke.

388
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,937
But you liked his image before.

389
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:58,276
I liked him as a gangster
but not as an actor.

390
00:32:58,311 --> 00:33:00,642
You said you wanted some real action.

391
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:07,185
Make a decision
after you shoot him.

392
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,413
I give up.

393
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,460
- Why is that guy here?
- 'Do I look funny to you? '

394
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:20,620
'Does my life look easy to you? '

395
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:28,339
How about saying it
in a different tone?

396
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:36,073
'Do I look funny to you? '

397
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:39,376
'Does my life look easy to you? '

398
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:43,243
I see you've practiced a lot.

399
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:45,478
What about the ending?

400
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,249
Will the ending be okay?

401
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:51,992
Just trust him and let's shoot.

402
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:56,789
- Mr. Bong, I'm leaving now.
- Okay.

403
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:04,798
What are you doing?

404
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:12,511
I tried out scene 87.

405
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:22,221
I tried out scene 87 as well.

406
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:27,025
Don't know whether
this is all acting or for real.

407
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:34,399
Ready.

408
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,078
How's my hair?

409
00:34:40,113 --> 00:34:41,010
Action!

410
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:45,213
Cut!

411
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:48,016
Cut!

412
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:50,853
Cut!

413
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:51,855
Do it again.

414
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,458
Can't you go any faster?

415
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:59,261
You're in worse shape than I thought.

416
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:06,000
Action!

417
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,131
Cut! Cut!

418
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:11,341
Do it again.

419
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:16,505
What idiot would run ahead of him?

420
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:19,748
Let's maintain the distance
and start again.

421
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:35,366
You're supposed to have spasms
by the scarred eye.

422
00:35:35,401 --> 00:35:37,960
That's the character's trademark.

423
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:45,574
Cut.

424
00:35:50,114 --> 00:35:50,978
Cut.

425
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:53,147
Cut.

426
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:57,145
Cut. Do it again.

427
00:35:58,589 --> 00:35:59,755
What now?

428
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:03,749
I'd like your eyes to be more vicious.

429
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,497
Hey, director.

430
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:09,523
Are you mad at me or something?

431
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:11,767
Isn't this enough?

432
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:14,134
Your eyes are perfect now.

433
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:17,131
Shall we stop?

434
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:24,714
Acting is a piece of cake, right?

435
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:27,978
Look at the camera and not me.

436
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:38,594
Cut.

437
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:42,564
How was he?

438
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:45,061
Not so bad.

439
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:48,534
But wouldn't you be the one
who suffers later?

440
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:53,038
Doesn't seem like it to me.

441
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:57,247
- Where's my right hand man?
- I think he had to leave, sir.

442
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:01,586
You can't stand movie shoots, too?

443
00:37:01,621 --> 00:37:04,749
No, sir, but are you okay?

444
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:10,289
Don't know whether this is a movie shoot
or some track race.

445
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,831
Man, I'm exhausted.

446
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:43,216
There will be no problem, sir.

447
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:55,928
The law is a pain in the ass.
Too many things to check.

448
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:01,276
Don't worry too much, sir.

449
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:05,748
You'll be able to come out
once the trial is over.

450
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:09,810
I don't like the fact
that I'm in the hands of a young boy.

451
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:13,422
But I heard he's very competent
for his age.

452
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:17,393
All he did was stud law.
What would he know about the world outside?

453
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:29,137
Cut!

454
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:33,403
Can't you do it more passionately?

455
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,043
Again!

456
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,113
Feels like old times.

457
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:39,806
Am I supposed to answer that?

458
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:43,950
Ready!

459
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:46,845
Action!

460
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:07,871
I love you.

461
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:22,339
Ki-su released from prison
comes to find Tae-sung.

462
00:39:22,374 --> 00:39:26,189
This is the first fight
so it needs to feel sudden.

463
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:29,399
But are you really doing it for real?

464
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:32,836
Yes.

465
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:37,708
You have to stop right
after I yell cut.

466
00:39:37,743 --> 00:39:38,841
Now, let's shoot.

467
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:44,513
Don't I need make-up and clothes, too?

468
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:49,986
We gave you that scar by your eye.
And your clothes look fine.

469
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:54,588
I've never seen that actor before.

470
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:57,493
He's not an actor.

471
00:39:57,528 --> 00:39:58,722
What are you talking about?

472
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:05,362
Ready.

473
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:12,676
Action!

474
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:16,739
Are you nervous?

475
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:18,812
I'll go easy on you.

476
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:28,724
Cut!

477
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,760
Why aren't you fighting?

478
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:34,198
Soo-ta, you getting scared
comes out directly on the screen.

479
00:40:34,233 --> 00:40:35,164
Let's go again.

480
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,599
What's wrong? Scared?

481
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:40,371
Does it look that way?

482
00:40:40,406 --> 00:40:41,804
What if he gets hurt?

483
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,706
I don't know.
This is my first time, too.

484
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:47,802
What will happen to our movie
if the lead actor dies?

485
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:51,076
You have such a way with words.

486
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:53,674
Ready.

487
00:40:57,688 --> 00:40:58,655
Action!

488
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:18,472
Excellent expressions.

489
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,227
More. More.

490
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:45,032
Cut.

491
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:48,796
Soo-ta, are you okay?

492
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,738
Get up.

493
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,436
Soo-ta, are you okay?

494
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,547
What about the camera?
Did it look okay?

495
00:41:58,582 --> 00:42:02,450
It looked good because it's real,
but are you able to keep this up?

496
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:06,821
- I'm okay.
- Okay, then.

497
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:13,552
- Sound!
- Speed.

498
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:15,198
Camera!

499
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:17,322
Action!

500
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:27,708
Cut!

501
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:38,254
Soo-ta, are you okay?

502
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:40,856
What the hell is this?
Bring a towel!

503
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:44,827
I told you to stop
right after I yell cut!

504
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:47,131
I'll talk to you later.

505
00:42:47,166 --> 00:42:49,099
Is this dog shit?

506
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:55,970
Are you trying to kill somebody
or make a movie?

507
00:42:56,473 --> 00:42:58,607
That's what he wanted.

508
00:42:58,642 --> 00:43:01,278
What?
You like beating people up?

509
00:43:01,313 --> 00:43:03,448
Then beat me up!

510
00:43:03,483 --> 00:43:05,548
Get up and hit me!

511
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,134
What are you waiting for?

512
00:43:07,169 --> 00:43:09,011
- Stop it.
- Let go of me!

513
00:43:09,046 --> 00:43:10,683
Is this guy some thug or what?

514
00:43:10,718 --> 00:43:12,321
Stop!
You're embarrassing me!

515
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:15,850
What the hell
is in that head of yours?

516
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:25,399
Worry about me and not the camera.

517
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:29,665
That's why you're one tempo late.

518
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:40,574
Does this make any sense?
The director should've stopped him!

519
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:44,722
But you're the one
who first agreed to do it.

520
00:43:44,757 --> 00:43:45,780
What, you bastard?

521
00:43:47,658 --> 00:43:48,682
Holy shit!

522
00:43:49,693 --> 00:43:53,185
That fucking gangster!

523
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:56,527
Wouldn't the actors you hit
have felt the same way?

524
00:43:57,701 --> 00:43:58,725
What did you say?

525
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,505
Who'd you ask to see me
all of a sudden?

526
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:08,978
We have to rest a few days anyway
because of your face.

527
00:44:09,947 --> 00:44:13,133
So how's you like getting hit?

528
00:44:13,168 --> 00:44:16,319
All I did was go by the script.

529
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:18,513
Sure.

530
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:23,052
So do you think
you can win in the end?

531
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:24,718
Of course.

532
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:28,555
If I hadn't become an actor,
I would've fought like you.

533
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:31,001
Really?

534
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:36,231
Real gangsters like us
hear people call us trash.

535
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:42,746
And those like you who can't act at all
hear people call them real actors.

536
00:44:42,781 --> 00:44:44,179
Isn't that funny?

537
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:47,785
If gangsters were the main characters
of this world,

538
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:49,810
wouldn't reality be very sad?

539
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:51,486
Don't you think?

540
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:56,020
Regular guys are the main characters
of this world.

541
00:44:56,794 --> 00:45:01,822
But if we beat them up in a warehouse,

542
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:05,102
the all piss and shit in their pants.

543
00:45:05,137 --> 00:45:06,770
You think you won't do the same?

544
00:45:06,805 --> 00:45:08,237
Are you threatening me?

545
00:45:12,576 --> 00:45:16,547
You two like drinking with an actor?

546
00:45:16,582 --> 00:45:17,571
Yes!

547
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:19,443
Then you all pay for the drinks.

548
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:22,050
- Hey!
- Yes?

549
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:25,650
- Take good care of him tonight.
- Okay.

550
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:30,417
- I don't need it.
- You're so grand.

551
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:48,476
Who is it?

552
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:50,608
Who?

553
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:53,006
Yes, Mi-na.

554
00:45:54,284 --> 00:45:55,216
Where?

555
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:58,019
What?

556
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:04,822
Mi-na.

557
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:07,564
Mi-na?

558
00:46:08,832 --> 00:46:09,821
Mi-na?

559
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:15,234
Let's have a look at your face.

560
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:21,176
What the hell?

561
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:25,011
Who the hell are you, asshole?

562
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:28,650
What was that?

563
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:31,586
I thought you were tougher,
but that was lame.

564
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:34,124
We're different from ordinary people.

565
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:35,113
What?

566
00:46:36,927 --> 00:46:39,596
It's a big headache for us
if we beat up anybody.

567
00:46:39,631 --> 00:46:40,893
What were you doing before?

568
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:43,124
I was on my way to a hotel
with a girl.

569
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:45,832
I must've intruded.

570
00:46:47,171 --> 00:46:49,002
Well, yes.

571
00:47:03,053 --> 00:47:04,077
Hye-ran, hi.

572
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,688
Were you sleeping?

573
00:47:06,723 --> 00:47:10,160
Su-jung, I just wanted
to drink with you.

574
00:47:10,195 --> 00:47:13,444
No, just go back to sleep.

575
00:47:13,479 --> 00:47:16,693
Don't wake up, damn it.

576
00:47:20,571 --> 00:47:23,233
You must've had a bad day.

577
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:27,603
There are some things
I can't understand.

578
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:32,847
He knows nothing and he thinks

579
00:47:32,882 --> 00:47:36,215
he's an actor after a few shoots.

580
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:40,351
Tell me what you think.

581
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:44,561
You think a gangster is an actor?

582
00:47:44,596 --> 00:47:46,392
Sorry, I don't understand.

583
00:47:53,837 --> 00:47:54,963
Hello?

584
00:47:57,307 --> 00:47:58,365
Eun-sun?

585
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:04,575
I just suddenly thought of you.

586
00:48:07,317 --> 00:48:08,477
Want to meet?

587
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:10,677
No.

588
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:15,784
I just needed someone to talk to.

589
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:26,603
Hold on.

590
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:42,617
That was strange.

591
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:45,245
I thought I heard someone outside.

592
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:51,992
You really called me out
because you wanted to talk?

593
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:56,797
What did you want to talk about?

594
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:02,265
You don't need to know.

595
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:05,709
You haven't changed at all.

596
00:49:05,744 --> 00:49:07,267
Fuck, what now?

597
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:10,879
Don't say a word today.

598
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:12,848
I got enough to deal with besides you.

599
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:19,685
I wish you'd get ruined.

600
00:49:21,325 --> 00:49:22,724
You're scary.

601
00:49:43,947 --> 00:49:44,971
Isn't that my chair?

602
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:47,981
Don't you see all these chairs?

603
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:51,154
I don't like it
when someone sits on my chair.

604
00:49:51,189 --> 00:49:53,247
I wish you'd show a little respect.

605
00:50:02,632 --> 00:50:04,735
This is how far we'll go
in this scene.

606
00:50:04,770 --> 00:50:08,320
Soo-ta says 'You want to die? '

607
00:50:08,355 --> 00:50:11,870
And then he puts out his cigarette

608
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:14,444
in this shot glass.

609
00:50:14,479 --> 00:50:15,411
Action!

610
00:50:21,718 --> 00:50:25,779
Here's the compensation
for your time in jail.

611
00:50:26,923 --> 00:50:28,151
Is this all?

612
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:31,186
What else do you want?

613
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,163
Everything that's yours.

614
00:50:35,298 --> 00:50:38,426
Even your woman
used to be mine though

615
00:50:39,936 --> 00:50:42,063
How dare you.

616
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:52,976
You filthy bastard.

617
00:51:13,703 --> 00:51:15,193
Be careful.

618
00:51:15,772 --> 00:51:16,830
Tae-sung.

619
00:51:19,109 --> 00:51:21,202
Cut! You scared me.

620
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:25,847
Isn't this a real bottle?

621
00:51:25,882 --> 00:51:27,949
Look at the blood on your hand.

622
00:51:27,984 --> 00:51:30,475
Why'd you improvise
something so dangerous?

623
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,055
I thought it would make me
feel better.

624
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:36,787
No, your acting was fantastic.
Better than any good actor.

625
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:41,889
Soo-ta, you were, uh, good.

626
00:51:43,066 --> 00:51:46,435
Put some medicine on his hand
this instant!

627
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:49,200
Ok! Enough for this scene.
Hurry up for the next take!

628
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:06,054
Who are you?

629
00:52:06,089 --> 00:52:07,821
What are you doing with my van?

630
00:52:07,856 --> 00:52:09,554
Hello, it's not what you think.

631
00:52:11,595 --> 00:52:13,747
- Why is your van so dirty?
- Who are you?

632
00:52:13,782 --> 00:52:15,899
- Why'd you spit?
- Why are you doing this?

633
00:52:15,934 --> 00:52:18,629
Do what?
You messed with my van.

634
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:21,063
I caught you red-handed.

635
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:30,212
We can rent a van
when we make more money.

636
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:32,441
Drive your car for a while.

637
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:38,154
You should've told me before
about the situation we were in.

638
00:52:38,922 --> 00:52:40,184
Are you even interested?

639
00:52:42,058 --> 00:52:43,692
Do you even know how much

640
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:46,355
you pay for rent
and your phone bills?

641
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:54,604
Soo-ta is hard to deal with,
but try to understand him.

642
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:58,563
He's got a lot of pride
as an actor, though.

643
00:53:00,043 --> 00:53:01,806
You two must've known each other.

644
00:53:03,547 --> 00:53:06,948
We used to date long ago.

645
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:13,152
When I was a first-time actress
a while back.

646
00:53:14,224 --> 00:53:18,058
Don't you feel uncomfortable
when you shoot a movie together?

647
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:21,128
Not really.

648
00:53:32,742 --> 00:53:36,576
I have something
I'm curious about, too.

649
00:53:38,648 --> 00:53:41,947
Why do you do what you do?

650
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,054
Because I've been doing it
for a while.

651
00:53:44,089 --> 00:53:47,615
Is that all?

652
00:53:50,927 --> 00:53:53,379
You're not going to do it
for real, right?

653
00:53:53,414 --> 00:53:58,134
- Do what?
- You know, our scene together.

654
00:53:58,169 --> 00:54:01,399
What exactly?

655
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:09,045
Who is it?

656
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:11,503
What problem?

657
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,916
- There's nothing.
- This sucks.

658
00:54:18,388 --> 00:54:19,616
Who called the police?

659
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:24,094
Chairman Baek's wife reported
that her diamond ring was stolen.

660
00:54:24,129 --> 00:54:27,552
The account book and secondary contract
had disappeared.

661
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,765
I should've gotten
rid of them earlier.

662
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,984
If it was a real thief,
he wouldn't have stolen them.

663
00:54:35,019 --> 00:54:39,168
If they're used as evidence,
the trial is no use.

664
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:43,344
That plant-watering,
antique-polishing

665
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,575
bastard betrays me?

666
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:49,869
Take care of him immediately.

667
00:54:49,904 --> 00:54:51,421
It's not a good time now, sir.

668
00:54:51,456 --> 00:54:52,388
Are you scared?

669
00:54:53,857 --> 00:54:57,427
You'd know what to do long ago
just by looking at my eyes.

670
00:54:57,462 --> 00:55:00,419
There's no time to waste.
Do it now.

671
00:55:06,703 --> 00:55:07,601
Hey.

672
00:55:12,509 --> 00:55:13,476
Who the hell are you?

673
00:55:48,545 --> 00:55:49,534
Where's Mr. Park?

674
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:52,907
Do you like him?

675
00:55:55,285 --> 00:55:57,014
He doesn't seem like a bad person.

676
00:56:00,156 --> 00:56:01,589
How do you know that?

677
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:05,558
Aren't you misjudging him?

678
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:08,363
A gangster is nothing but a gangster.

679
00:56:08,398 --> 00:56:10,423
You can't predict
what guys like him will do.

680
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:13,768
Don't judge people so easily.

681
00:56:19,676 --> 00:56:24,314
We're going to do a long take
with one cut.

682
00:56:24,349 --> 00:56:26,475
And be careful with the sound.

683
00:56:35,692 --> 00:56:38,183
We're not like before, so move aside.

684
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:40,658
You must be on your way home.

685
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:43,993
You were with him last night?

686
00:56:44,634 --> 00:56:46,158
Don't be so childish.

687
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:50,774
Then I'll check
what you did last night myself.

688
00:56:50,809 --> 00:56:52,559
Let go of me!

689
00:56:52,594 --> 00:56:54,275
Shut the hell up!

690
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:57,245
- Stop it!
- You fucking bitch!

691
00:56:58,515 --> 00:56:59,504
Let go!

692
00:57:01,818 --> 00:57:02,807
Damn it.

693
00:57:17,634 --> 00:57:19,192
Help!

694
00:57:25,575 --> 00:57:26,633
Crazy bastard.

695
00:57:28,745 --> 00:57:30,007
Get out of there!

696
00:57:30,914 --> 00:57:32,381
You rotten filth.

697
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:34,009
Cut, what's going on?

698
00:57:34,317 --> 00:57:37,548
This isn't acting!
He's doing it for real!

699
00:57:40,156 --> 00:57:42,215
Don't cry and wipe your tears.

700
00:57:48,164 --> 00:57:49,859
Did you do it for real?

701
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:53,531
Rotten filth?

702
00:58:17,227 --> 00:58:20,526
Where is the book and contract?

703
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:27,327
Did Chairman Baek say he'd spare me
if I tell you?

704
00:58:28,037 --> 00:58:31,529
I promise nothing will happen to you.

705
00:58:32,742 --> 00:58:34,903
You expect me to believe that?

706
00:59:16,823 --> 00:59:17,881
Fuck, give it to me.

707
00:59:21,561 --> 00:59:23,324
What do you want to be later?

708
00:59:24,664 --> 00:59:26,800
Why don't you have something
you're good at?

709
00:59:26,835 --> 00:59:30,101
How can you live without any goals?

710
00:59:30,136 --> 00:59:32,472
What does youth mean
without an ambition?

711
00:59:32,507 --> 00:59:35,339
Again, your bull shit philosophy.

712
00:59:39,446 --> 00:59:41,107
Something good happen to you?

713
00:59:42,949 --> 00:59:45,543
It's you who's had something
good happen.

714
00:59:47,454 --> 00:59:50,287
Since you had a big role
for an extra.

715
00:59:53,393 --> 00:59:54,883
I had a good time watching your movie.

716
00:59:58,598 --> 01:00:01,761
What are you two doing
standing there?

717
01:00:03,103 --> 01:00:04,764
Soo-ta, get ready.

718
01:00:07,006 --> 01:00:08,496
Your acting has gotten a lot better.

719
01:00:10,143 --> 01:00:11,838
You seem like a real actor now.

720
01:00:17,217 --> 01:00:18,241
Action.

721
01:00:19,152 --> 01:00:24,522
Have you ever dreamed once
of something you can't have?

722
01:00:25,658 --> 01:00:28,718
You never wanted to become
someone else?

723
01:00:32,499 --> 01:00:37,664
If I could be you,
I wanted to steal your girl.

724
01:00:41,307 --> 01:00:42,934
Then you'd go off
to a far away place,

725
01:00:45,011 --> 01:00:46,774
and live as if you were dead.

726
01:00:55,655 --> 01:00:58,749
Didn't you say that you'd spare me?

727
01:01:07,901 --> 01:01:10,131
Here's some traveling expenses
on your way.

728
01:01:18,511 --> 01:01:20,502
Then you'd go off
to a far away place,

729
01:01:21,648 --> 01:01:24,845
and live as if you were dead.

730
01:01:25,485 --> 01:01:26,349
Sir.

731
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:27,909
Free him.

732
01:01:28,688 --> 01:01:30,280
If Chairman Baek
finds out about this...

733
01:01:31,691 --> 01:01:32,919
Keep this a secret.

734
01:01:38,932 --> 01:01:40,194
I took care of everything, sir.

735
01:01:40,767 --> 01:01:46,000
Seeing that Mr. Park betrayed me,
I have no one to trust.

736
01:01:52,579 --> 01:01:54,274
How far away is the trial?

737
01:01:56,349 --> 01:01:57,907
Two weeks, sir.

738
01:02:04,991 --> 01:02:06,185
And Mr. Park?

739
01:02:06,893 --> 01:02:08,554
I sent him abroad
without anyone knowing.

740
01:02:09,629 --> 01:02:12,530
We aren't in good circumstances,
so please stop acting.

741
01:02:14,434 --> 01:02:15,594
Is there a problem?

742
01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:18,498
Everything's been solved.

743
01:02:20,873 --> 01:02:22,500
You seemed to have changed, sir.

744
01:02:23,943 --> 01:02:25,035
Go.

745
01:02:32,151 --> 01:02:33,743
Why are you so serious?

746
01:02:36,522 --> 01:02:38,717
You have to set up the car like that?

747
01:02:40,193 --> 01:02:42,211
It's safe that way.

748
01:02:42,246 --> 01:02:44,195
Why? Can't stand it?

749
01:02:44,230 --> 01:02:48,368
It always seemed strange that the car
is higher than other cars in movies.

750
01:02:48,403 --> 01:02:50,131
Why don't you just direct
the movie yourself?

751
01:02:54,841 --> 01:02:56,274
Here.

752
01:02:56,309 --> 01:02:59,210
I can't trust my agent with it.

753
01:02:59,245 --> 01:03:01,406
Be gentle to it,
it's sensitive like a woman.

754
01:03:18,131 --> 01:03:19,155
Cut! What is this!

755
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:21,732
My car!

756
01:03:23,436 --> 01:03:24,425
My damn car.

757
01:03:25,405 --> 01:03:27,168
That gangster bastard!

758
01:04:30,603 --> 01:04:31,535
Mi-na!

759
01:04:32,472 --> 01:04:33,632
Cut! What is this!

760
01:04:38,611 --> 01:04:40,413
- Sound!
- Speed.

761
01:04:40,448 --> 01:04:41,345
Camera!

762
01:04:42,782 --> 01:04:43,840
Action!

763
01:04:45,651 --> 01:04:48,745
Open your eyes! Open your eyes!

764
01:05:04,637 --> 01:05:06,002
Today is your last day, right?

765
01:05:06,939 --> 01:05:09,533
Yes, I died just now.

766
01:05:11,077 --> 01:05:12,476
I'll come visit the set often.

767
01:05:15,381 --> 01:05:20,819
I'm sorry about being
so rough last time.

768
01:05:23,856 --> 01:05:28,486
Did you really jump in
to save me on purpose?

769
01:05:32,765 --> 01:05:34,027
I didn't see the camera.

770
01:06:26,285 --> 01:06:27,252
Smile.

771
01:06:32,325 --> 01:06:33,519
Do you live here?

772
01:06:35,061 --> 01:06:36,050
I move around.

773
01:06:39,031 --> 01:06:40,692
What happened here?

774
01:06:43,603 --> 01:06:44,934
Don't say anything.

775
01:06:48,541 --> 01:06:54,537
I thought I could understand anyone
when I was young.

776
01:06:57,149 --> 01:06:59,709
But I've lost confidence in it
the more I've gotten older.

777
01:07:09,028 --> 01:07:11,019
Hey, aren't you overdoing it?

778
01:07:13,232 --> 01:07:14,824
You're not even listening to me.

779
01:07:24,377 --> 01:07:25,344
Hey, Soo-ta.

780
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:28,804
Soo-ta!

781
01:07:32,652 --> 01:07:33,550
What?

782
01:07:37,189 --> 01:07:38,356
What's this all about?

783
01:07:38,391 --> 01:07:40,723
If you have a mouth,
then tell me what this is.

784
01:07:43,296 --> 01:07:44,354
I don't know.

785
01:07:46,732 --> 01:07:47,699
You don't know?

786
01:07:49,602 --> 01:07:51,936
Who the hell is this girl?

787
01:07:51,971 --> 01:07:53,495
Just because you don't know
that's it?

788
01:07:53,806 --> 01:07:55,773
Stop it! I'm going nuts, too!

789
01:07:55,808 --> 01:07:58,210
How long do I have
to clean up your mess?

790
01:07:58,245 --> 01:08:00,613
Know how hard it is
working with you?

791
01:08:00,648 --> 01:08:02,080
Then quit!

792
01:08:02,548 --> 01:08:04,998
- Are you done talking?
- I'm done.

793
01:08:05,033 --> 01:08:07,448
You live off me,
so stop complaining.

794
01:08:07,987 --> 01:08:08,954
What?

795
01:08:10,022 --> 01:08:11,319
What's so special about your life?

796
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:35,543
Did you do it?

797
01:08:37,350 --> 01:08:39,619
You and I were the only one there.

798
01:08:39,654 --> 01:08:41,746
Tell me! Did you do it?

799
01:08:43,089 --> 01:08:45,922
Say something!

800
01:08:46,726 --> 01:08:49,559
Let go.
I don't want to say anything.

801
01:08:51,464 --> 01:08:53,329
If it wasn't you, then who sent it?

802
01:09:00,606 --> 01:09:02,006
- Hello?
- It's me.

803
01:09:02,041 --> 01:09:05,077
They called me.
What they want is money.

804
01:09:05,112 --> 01:09:06,704
Wait at home for now.

805
01:09:07,346 --> 01:09:08,438
Okay.

806
01:09:14,754 --> 01:09:17,882
Why the hell are you
doing this to me?

807
01:09:51,157 --> 01:09:53,921
What happened?

808
01:09:57,463 --> 01:10:00,533
I think those bastards
are hoodlums from that area.

809
01:10:00,568 --> 01:10:01,864
They want to raise the money.

810
01:10:03,402 --> 01:10:05,403
It's a lot.

811
01:10:05,438 --> 01:10:08,498
I think they know that
if we call the police

812
01:10:09,141 --> 01:10:11,010
then it'll get publicized.

813
01:10:11,045 --> 01:10:13,044
Sons of bitches.

814
01:10:13,079 --> 01:10:15,570
Where do we get
that kind of money so quickly?

815
01:10:18,918 --> 01:10:21,919
Even if it's a celebrity's car,

816
01:10:21,954 --> 01:10:24,980
I can't buy it at that price
since it's used.

817
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:30,260
Can I ask for your autograph
while you're here?

818
01:10:50,416 --> 01:10:51,474
What's the reason?

819
01:10:52,985 --> 01:10:54,111
You don't need to know.

820
01:10:55,521 --> 01:10:56,818
It's not petty cash.

821
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:10,264
Keep it a secret.
I'll retrieve my car later.

822
01:11:16,609 --> 01:11:19,011
Why do you trust him with our money?

823
01:11:19,046 --> 01:11:22,242
Do a job for me, quietly.

824
01:12:11,664 --> 01:12:12,631
Follow that car.

825
01:12:31,984 --> 01:12:32,950
What?

826
01:12:32,985 --> 01:12:35,853
We caught them, but one got away.

827
01:12:35,888 --> 01:12:38,356
What if that bastard
blows the whistle?

828
01:12:39,792 --> 01:12:40,850
Hurry and find him.

829
01:12:41,961 --> 01:12:43,761
When he calls again,

830
01:12:43,796 --> 01:12:47,596
I'll go get the tape
so you wait here.

831
01:12:55,641 --> 01:12:56,539
Hello?

832
01:12:57,643 --> 01:12:59,406
That wasn't us.

833
01:13:00,246 --> 01:13:01,547
I said that wasn't us!

834
01:13:01,582 --> 01:13:03,811
Hello? Hello?

835
01:13:05,985 --> 01:13:07,714
Some gangsters attacked them.

836
01:13:08,821 --> 01:13:10,723
They're really pissed off.

837
01:13:10,758 --> 01:13:11,917
Did you hire them?

838
01:13:15,961 --> 01:13:17,292
Don't you get what I'm saying?

839
01:13:18,664 --> 01:13:21,326
Want people to hear
that I hired some gangsters?

840
01:13:23,636 --> 01:13:25,035
Don't interfere any more.

841
01:13:32,711 --> 01:13:34,576
Sorry about getting mad last time.

842
01:13:37,850 --> 01:13:39,010
You know how I really feel, right?

843
01:13:55,968 --> 01:13:56,957
I'll go.

844
01:13:57,903 --> 01:14:00,201
No, I want to solve this myself.

845
01:14:18,557 --> 01:14:19,758
And the tape?

846
01:14:19,793 --> 01:14:20,884
Not now.

847
01:14:21,727 --> 01:14:23,896
I'll give it to you
when you return my boys.

848
01:14:23,931 --> 01:14:26,198
You should've stuck with the rules.

849
01:14:26,233 --> 01:14:28,496
- You bastard!
- Let go!

850
01:14:42,081 --> 01:14:43,048
Stop the car!

851
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:02,292
Was it him?

852
01:15:04,269 --> 01:15:05,634
The tape and the video are in here.

853
01:15:06,438 --> 01:15:07,405
Yes, it is.

854
01:15:11,744 --> 01:15:12,676
What's going on?

855
01:15:15,447 --> 01:15:19,406
In the end,
you and I live no differently.

856
01:15:21,954 --> 01:15:23,819
Take it before the cops arrive.

857
01:15:29,528 --> 01:15:32,796
No, you're the one who should leave.

858
01:15:32,831 --> 01:15:35,801
I'm handing him over to the cops.
And everyone who's involved.

859
01:15:35,836 --> 01:15:37,469
If that goes in their hands,
you're in jeopardy.

860
01:15:37,504 --> 01:15:39,562
But I can't handle things like you.

861
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:45,034
What's so different
between him and you all?

862
01:15:46,145 --> 01:15:47,840
To be honest, I don't know.

863
01:15:49,114 --> 01:15:51,912
You ungrateful son of a bitch.

864
01:15:58,357 --> 01:15:59,658
What are you doing?

865
01:15:59,693 --> 01:16:00,924
No, not like this.

866
01:16:00,959 --> 01:16:03,325
If this gets out, you're done for.
Don't you get it?

867
01:16:15,074 --> 01:16:16,735
I've lost.

868
01:16:17,843 --> 01:16:19,105
I'm sorry, sir.

869
01:16:20,913 --> 01:16:23,677
You've gotten a lot better.

870
01:16:24,716 --> 01:16:27,186
But what's wrong
with your expression?

871
01:16:27,221 --> 01:16:29,054
Is there any problem?

872
01:16:29,089 --> 01:16:30,248
No, sir.

873
01:16:30,856 --> 01:16:32,623
There's nothing to worry about.

874
01:16:32,658 --> 01:16:37,095
Of course there shouldn't be.
Only one week left until the trial.

875
01:16:40,432 --> 01:16:43,731
I heard you're acting in a movie.

876
01:16:45,971 --> 01:16:49,031
I have a lot of eyes and ears
out there that you don't know.

877
01:16:51,410 --> 01:16:52,434
I'm sorry, sir.

878
01:16:53,112 --> 01:16:56,639
Sometimes I don't know
what's in that head of yours.

879
01:17:14,233 --> 01:17:15,222
Damn it.

880
01:17:24,376 --> 01:17:25,468
Right here!

881
01:17:29,114 --> 01:17:30,547
You little...

882
01:17:33,418 --> 01:17:34,749
Damn it.

883
01:17:34,784 --> 01:17:36,081
Hello?

884
01:17:38,323 --> 01:17:40,450
I'm busy so don't call.

885
01:17:41,527 --> 01:17:43,494
You asshole.

886
01:17:43,529 --> 01:17:46,396
I'm not cursing at you.
I'm hanging up.

887
01:17:51,470 --> 01:17:54,837
- Why'd you answer the phone like that?
- It's nothing, sir.

888
01:17:55,407 --> 01:17:56,305
Who was it?

889
01:17:57,876 --> 01:17:58,843
My mother.

890
01:17:59,545 --> 01:18:03,106
Her birthday is in a few days.
She asked when I'm coming to visit.

891
01:18:10,989 --> 01:18:11,956
Go visit her.

892
01:18:12,691 --> 01:18:13,953
That's okay, sir.

893
01:18:17,029 --> 01:18:18,053
Thank you, sir.

894
01:18:20,399 --> 01:18:21,764
I'll be back soon.

895
01:18:26,905 --> 01:18:27,963
What did I say wrong, sir?

896
01:18:30,943 --> 01:18:32,934
- Let's shoot a movie.
- Sir?

897
01:18:46,725 --> 01:18:47,692
Come on.

898
01:19:29,001 --> 01:19:29,865
Boss!

899
01:19:31,270 --> 01:19:32,532
Mr. Park...

900
01:19:42,014 --> 01:19:43,709
What will you do?

901
01:19:56,328 --> 01:19:58,956
Mr. Kim, let's have lunch later.

902
01:20:10,142 --> 01:20:11,700
You look very surprised.

903
01:20:12,544 --> 01:20:15,881
You're not supposed to be alive.
Have you forgotten?

904
01:20:15,916 --> 01:20:18,281
How can a living person
act as if he's dead?

905
01:20:20,018 --> 01:20:23,181
Wouldn't Chairman Baek
know that I'm alive?

906
01:20:25,223 --> 01:20:29,561
You seem to be in a very tight spot.

907
01:20:29,596 --> 01:20:31,119
Let me ask you one thing.

908
01:20:32,264 --> 01:20:34,391
Why'd you let me live?

909
01:20:37,069 --> 01:20:39,765
Why'd you spare me?

910
01:20:54,820 --> 01:20:57,255
I heard he might testify
for the other party.

911
01:20:57,290 --> 01:20:58,857
We should take care of him now.

912
01:20:58,892 --> 01:21:00,924
It's not that easy now.

913
01:21:00,959 --> 01:21:02,824
I have to meet Chairman Baek for now.

914
01:21:03,862 --> 01:21:06,831
Follow him
and don't do anything hasty.

915
01:21:09,334 --> 01:21:12,497
Go back.
He declined your request to see him.

916
01:22:09,928 --> 01:22:12,464
Who are you?
What bastard sent you?

917
01:22:12,499 --> 01:22:14,898
I got the wrong room.

918
01:22:55,574 --> 01:22:57,269
Eun-sun

919
01:23:22,567 --> 01:23:23,659
They said he died from a fall.

920
01:23:24,636 --> 01:23:27,400
The police will determine
that it was a suicide.

921
01:23:55,433 --> 01:23:56,400
Sir...

922
01:24:04,943 --> 01:24:06,274
It's not a suicide.

923
01:24:21,393 --> 01:24:23,327
Sir, we don't have time for this.

924
01:24:24,162 --> 01:24:27,265
If you don't do something,
it's dangerous.

925
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:28,289
Cut.

926
01:24:31,369 --> 01:24:33,303
- Put some more blood on him.
- Sir.

927
01:24:38,009 --> 01:24:39,499
Who are they back there?

928
01:24:40,979 --> 01:24:42,742
I brought two more just in case.

929
01:24:44,583 --> 01:24:45,777
Chicken shits.

930
01:24:47,686 --> 01:24:49,711
It's not the time to relax.

931
01:24:52,257 --> 01:24:54,122
Don't you know
that Chairman Baek abandoned us?

932
01:24:56,194 --> 01:24:59,297
You say you quit,
but what does that leave me?

933
01:24:59,332 --> 01:25:01,031
What is it that you want?

934
01:25:01,066 --> 01:25:04,001
Did you plan all this?
Because I mocked you in the beginning?

935
01:25:06,771 --> 01:25:08,261
Think whatever you like.

936
01:25:14,446 --> 01:25:16,181
If you just go, then that's it?

937
01:25:16,216 --> 01:25:18,379
Gang-pae! Gang-pae!

938
01:25:18,414 --> 01:25:20,542
Movies aren't a joke!

939
01:25:22,087 --> 01:25:24,723
Let go of me, you bastard!

940
01:25:24,758 --> 01:25:26,520
Gang-pae! Gang-pae!

941
01:25:27,792 --> 01:25:30,727
I don't know your reasons,
but you can't do this.

942
01:25:47,746 --> 01:25:50,738
Yeah, you don't fit here.

943
01:25:51,716 --> 01:25:53,149
Go, you bastard!

944
01:25:53,184 --> 01:25:55,277
Go live like filth
for the rest of your life!

945
01:25:56,488 --> 01:25:57,978
Pitiful bastard.

946
01:25:58,890 --> 01:26:01,290
- Watch your mouth.
- What's it with you?

947
01:26:01,993 --> 01:26:02,857
You don't know shit.

948
01:26:04,195 --> 01:26:05,389
You worthless thug.

949
01:26:11,169 --> 01:26:16,402
I let you slide since he liked you,
but you have no respect.

950
01:26:17,809 --> 01:26:19,606
Look down, asshole.

951
01:26:25,517 --> 01:26:27,314
Feel humiliated in front
of everyone, huh?

952
01:26:28,353 --> 01:26:30,753
Then look down
or else it'll get worse.

953
01:26:32,390 --> 01:26:36,622
You son of a bitch!
Come on and fight!

954
01:26:38,530 --> 01:26:40,230
Hurts like hell, doesn't it?

955
01:26:40,265 --> 01:26:43,568
I'll make you look down
before I hit you ten times.

956
01:26:43,603 --> 01:26:44,865
Look down.

957
01:26:48,573 --> 01:26:49,562
One!

958
01:26:52,911 --> 01:26:53,878
Two!

959
01:26:56,548 --> 01:26:57,515
Three!

960
01:26:59,551 --> 01:27:04,989
Can't you differentiate
movies from real life?

961
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:09,652
Let's go.

962
01:27:12,931 --> 01:27:14,228
Fine.

963
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,495
Let's see who will win.

964
01:27:18,937 --> 01:27:19,904
Four!

965
01:27:21,973 --> 01:27:22,997
Five!

966
01:27:24,976 --> 01:27:26,068
Six!

967
01:27:34,652 --> 01:27:36,085
Pitiful bastard.

968
01:27:37,822 --> 01:27:39,619
Just remember one thing.

969
01:27:40,492 --> 01:27:44,087
This is all because of you.

970
01:28:28,940 --> 01:28:33,036
Let's do it for real this time.

971
01:28:38,249 --> 01:28:39,295
- Sir!
- Sir!

972
01:28:39,330 --> 01:28:40,341
You bastards!

973
01:29:01,606 --> 01:29:03,506
Why are you calling so late?

974
01:29:04,509 --> 01:29:07,745
Shouldn't you be next to me
at a time like this?

975
01:29:07,780 --> 01:29:10,982
Is this Jang Soo-ta?
This is the police calling.

976
01:29:11,017 --> 01:29:12,108
The police?

977
01:29:17,422 --> 01:29:19,151
Get rid of that frown.

978
01:29:20,758 --> 01:29:23,454
Think you're at home?
Sit right, you bastard.

979
01:29:27,966 --> 01:29:30,867
- Damn it.
- You're here already.

980
01:29:31,703 --> 01:29:33,637
What happened to you?
I couldn't reach you.

981
01:29:41,579 --> 01:29:42,568
What's this?

982
01:29:43,514 --> 01:29:44,606
Why do you have this on you?

983
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:50,782
You did it?

984
01:29:53,458 --> 01:29:55,560
You did this from the beginning?

985
01:29:55,595 --> 01:29:57,027
I don't think so.

986
01:29:57,929 --> 01:30:01,865
He seemed to have raised the amount
during the transaction.

987
01:30:03,067 --> 01:30:07,939
He had some gambling debt,
so that could be why he did it.

988
01:30:07,974 --> 01:30:10,032
You broke the tape because of that?

989
01:30:16,214 --> 01:30:18,148
That was some really good acting.

990
01:30:20,618 --> 01:30:22,347
What have you done for me?

991
01:30:25,023 --> 01:30:26,891
How could you say that to me?

992
01:30:26,926 --> 01:30:28,677
How could you of all people?

993
01:30:28,712 --> 01:30:31,472
- Hey, calm down.
- Let me!

994
01:30:31,507 --> 01:30:34,070
Please stop it. It's over now.

995
01:30:34,105 --> 01:30:36,634
- It's not over!
- That's enough!

996
01:30:36,669 --> 01:30:38,966
Are you fucking human?

997
01:30:39,504 --> 01:30:40,803
Let go!

998
01:30:40,838 --> 01:30:42,328
Are you human?

999
01:30:43,808 --> 01:30:45,742
How could you do that to me?

1000
01:31:12,136 --> 01:31:14,304
Hi, it's me.

1001
01:31:14,339 --> 01:31:16,500
I wish you wouldn't call me anymore.

1002
01:31:18,810 --> 01:31:24,715
I was calling someone else,
but I must've pressed the wrong button.

1003
01:31:25,616 --> 01:31:27,743
I'm busy so if you don't have
anything to say I'm hanging up.

1004
01:31:30,254 --> 01:31:31,619
Okay, talk to you later.

1005
01:31:57,081 --> 01:32:01,017
Being dead or alive
can't be left in someone's hands.

1006
01:32:06,524 --> 01:32:10,119
Chairman Baek and you all
are now done for.

1007
01:32:12,730 --> 01:32:15,528
How about working under me?

1008
01:32:30,081 --> 01:32:31,173
Use it for traveling expenses.

1009
01:32:33,184 --> 01:32:35,084
I have to return the favor.

1010
01:33:31,943 --> 01:33:34,571
Or pay back the production costs!

1011
01:33:37,582 --> 01:33:38,776
Say something.

1012
01:33:39,250 --> 01:33:42,487
You bring a gangster to this movie
and ruin everything!

1013
01:33:42,522 --> 01:33:44,853
Now you don't want
to be responsible for it?

1014
01:33:58,936 --> 01:34:02,705
Let's shoot again.

1015
01:34:02,740 --> 01:34:04,537
Are you fucking playing games?

1016
01:34:06,777 --> 01:34:08,074
What happened to your face?

1017
01:34:08,980 --> 01:34:10,447
Then why'd you go in the first place?

1018
01:34:11,516 --> 01:34:13,384
Shall I just go?

1019
01:34:13,419 --> 01:34:14,976
Go where?

1020
01:34:15,953 --> 01:34:17,443
You probably had your reasons.

1021
01:34:22,260 --> 01:34:24,023
You don't make the decisions
around here.

1022
01:34:24,729 --> 01:34:26,287
Get lost, you son of a bitch.

1023
01:34:47,018 --> 01:34:49,051
You bragged about being an actor,

1024
01:34:49,086 --> 01:34:52,988
but now you don't care about
what happens to the movie?

1025
01:34:54,659 --> 01:34:55,819
Get lost, you bastard.

1026
01:35:06,971 --> 01:35:08,304
Punch me.

1027
01:35:08,339 --> 01:35:09,601
Crazy bastard.

1028
01:35:11,175 --> 01:35:14,474
You don't care about
what happens to the movie anyway.

1029
01:35:15,846 --> 01:35:17,177
I don't care of course.

1030
01:35:25,556 --> 01:35:26,716
What the...

1031
01:35:27,191 --> 01:35:28,624
What the hell are you doing?

1032
01:35:29,660 --> 01:35:31,855
Let's fight now.

1033
01:35:32,930 --> 01:35:33,954
Punch me.

1034
01:35:36,267 --> 01:35:38,895
Why?
Don't have the confidence to win?

1035
01:35:40,871 --> 01:35:42,702
There's no camera here.

1036
01:35:43,374 --> 01:35:46,036
Don't be conscious of people
and fight freely.

1037
01:35:48,879 --> 01:35:50,904
Why are you doing this?

1038
01:35:55,186 --> 01:35:57,051
If you want it that bad,
then let's do it for real.

1039
01:35:58,889 --> 01:36:00,516
But this isn't the place.

1040
01:36:14,305 --> 01:36:17,672
My play starts next weekend.
You're coming, right?

1041
01:36:19,210 --> 01:36:20,541
Do I have to go?

1042
01:36:21,946 --> 01:36:23,743
Of course you do.

1043
01:36:33,124 --> 01:36:35,115
Your face is full of scars.

1044
01:36:40,031 --> 01:36:43,091
Why do you keep kissing me?

1045
01:36:46,037 --> 01:36:47,868
So that you won't feel any pain.

1046
01:36:49,607 --> 01:36:51,666
So that no one will hurt you.

1047
01:37:01,218 --> 01:37:06,656
I feel like a different person
when I'm with you.

1048
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:11,193
What kind of person?

1049
01:37:52,870 --> 01:37:56,568
Ice caramel macchiato
and a parfait please.

1050
01:37:56,603 --> 01:38:00,266
Are you the actor Jang Soo-ta
by any chance?

1051
01:38:01,212 --> 01:38:04,477
No, you've gotten the wrong person.

1052
01:38:05,349 --> 01:38:08,284
I like your movies.
Have a good time.

1053
01:38:19,964 --> 01:38:21,261
I didn't think you'd come.

1054
01:38:27,104 --> 01:38:30,540
Don't you feel uncomfortable here?

1055
01:38:34,278 --> 01:38:35,302
Well, no...

1056
01:38:38,349 --> 01:38:39,748
How's the coffee?

1057
01:38:42,319 --> 01:38:43,479
Not bad.

1058
01:39:20,424 --> 01:39:21,391
Cut!

1059
01:39:27,164 --> 01:39:29,860
This is the very end.

1060
01:39:30,768 --> 01:39:32,770
Are you really going to fight?

1061
01:39:32,805 --> 01:39:33,794
Yes.

1062
01:39:36,941 --> 01:39:38,135
You have the confidence, right?

1063
01:39:39,643 --> 01:39:41,779
Just make sure we get filmed.

1064
01:39:41,814 --> 01:39:44,248
Okay, let's do it.

1065
01:39:44,283 --> 01:39:46,031
You can win.

1066
01:39:46,066 --> 01:39:47,780
Okay, get ready.

1067
01:39:48,419 --> 01:39:50,353
Get ready for the last take!

1068
01:39:51,989 --> 01:39:53,757
Everyone get ready!

1069
01:39:53,792 --> 01:39:55,491
Bring me some socks.

1070
01:39:55,526 --> 01:39:57,827
Camera A, go with a full shot!

1071
01:39:57,862 --> 01:40:02,299
Camera B and Camera C,
shoot the actors with close ups.

1072
01:40:04,368 --> 01:40:07,235
- Will it come out like in the script?
- I don't know either.

1073
01:40:07,805 --> 01:40:09,329
The director doesn't know everything.

1074
01:40:10,274 --> 01:40:11,798
Then what do you know?

1075
01:40:12,476 --> 01:40:14,637
That the director should trust
his actors till the very end.

1076
01:40:32,162 --> 01:40:33,696
I'll be gentle.

1077
01:40:33,731 --> 01:40:34,891
Give me all that you got.

1078
01:40:35,966 --> 01:40:38,161
- Ready!
- Shoot.

1079
01:40:38,502 --> 01:40:40,504
- Sound!
- OK.

1080
01:40:40,539 --> 01:40:42,199
Camera!

1081
01:40:42,673 --> 01:40:43,867
Action!

1082
01:42:43,994 --> 01:42:45,120
Is that all that you got?

1083
01:44:50,220 --> 01:44:51,619
Cut!

1084
01:44:55,425 --> 01:44:57,060
Did all the cameras get everything?

1085
01:44:57,095 --> 01:44:58,857
They fucking did it.

1086
01:45:00,898 --> 01:45:02,229
You two were wonderful.

1087
01:45:04,034 --> 01:45:05,667
Absolutely wonderful.

1088
01:45:05,702 --> 01:45:08,296
Don't cry. You look like a loser.

1089
01:45:54,551 --> 01:45:55,643
Where are you going?

1090
01:45:56,553 --> 01:45:59,647
Now that the shoot's over,
the director wanted to have a drink.

1091
01:46:01,158 --> 01:46:04,218
Now you seem like a real actor.

1092
01:46:46,270 --> 01:46:47,828
Where are you going in such a rush?

1093
01:46:48,505 --> 01:46:50,138
To shoot a movie.

1094
01:46:50,173 --> 01:46:52,767
What? Without a camera?

1095
01:46:53,911 --> 01:46:55,796
You're the camera.

1096
01:46:55,831 --> 01:46:57,336
Don't be silly.

1097
01:46:57,371 --> 01:46:58,841
Film it right.

1098
01:47:21,104 --> 01:47:22,435
I'll carry it for you.

1099
01:47:24,741 --> 01:47:25,867
Sure.

1100
01:47:28,245 --> 01:47:31,305
Be careful carrying it.
It's precious.

1101
01:48:49,326 --> 01:48:50,486
You bastard!

1102
01:48:51,928 --> 01:48:55,056
Son of bitch!
Don't move!

1103
01:48:56,833 --> 01:48:57,857
Come here!

1104
01:49:01,638 --> 01:49:02,627
Step aside.
