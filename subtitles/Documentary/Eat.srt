00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:38,372
Great.

("Beauty Killer"

6
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:02,330
* So self-obsessed with
my mascara and mistakes

7
00:01:02,363 --> 00:01:06,033
* Vanity's like a funeral
and everyone's at my wake

8
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:10,171
* Before I run out of air
there's more makeup to apply

9
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:14,074
* Doll eyes stare into
Valium-colored skies

10
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:17,611
* I've got a sweet tooth
and strawberry youth

11
00:01:17,645 --> 00:01:22,150
* You wanna be my licorice
and misguided youth

12
00:01:22,183 --> 00:01:27,188
* And right now
I'll show you how

13
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:33,127
* I'm a beauty killer

14
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:42,636
* Rhinestone my eyes closed
and please fix my hair

15
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,674
* This concealer can't
hide all my pink nightmares

16
00:01:46,707 --> 00:01:50,444
* Before I run out of air
there's more makeup to apply

* Doll eyes stare into
Valium-colored skies

18
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:59,086
* I almost died
but it felt great

19
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,956
* Faking perfection
wasn't worth the wait

20
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:07,161
* I may be easy, easy to hate

21
00:02:07,195 --> 00:02:10,898
* But you're so fucking
easy, easy to break

22
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:14,902
* I've got a sweet tooth
and strawberry youth

23
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:19,807

and misguided truth

I'll show you how

Hello Novella.

37
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,494
Oh, hey Tracy.

38
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:48,195
What happened to your agent?

39
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,463
What's that?

40
00:03:49,497 --> 00:03:50,498
Oh, I saw that you're
not with Teller & Davis

41
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:52,466
On the sign-in sheet.

42
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,767
Oh yeah, I've been
thinking about moving on

43
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:55,636
For a while now.

44
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:57,771
Really, hmm.

45
00:03:57,805 --> 00:04:00,274
Olivia Thompson said
they let you go.

46
00:04:00,308 --> 00:04:03,611
No, I moved on.

47
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:07,615
Did you ever get
a call back for that

48
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:09,249
Budweiser commercial?

49
00:04:09,283 --> 00:04:10,584
Sure didn't.

50
00:04:10,618 --> 00:04:11,619
Oh really?

51
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:13,053
Well, I got the part.

52
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,588
We're lensing next week.

53
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:15,456
Oh.

54
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:16,390
That's great.

55
00:04:16,424 --> 00:04:18,025
Who's the producer on that?

56
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:20,260
Kurt Hansen.

57
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,331
I thought he was gay.

58
00:04:23,364 --> 00:04:24,732
What does that matter?

59
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,534
Because he's
obviously hiring you

60
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:27,801
So you could blow him.

61
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:29,136
Everyone does.

62
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:30,804
What would a gay
guy get out of that?

63
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:32,039
Fuck off.

64
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:33,206
I mean I guess it
doesn't really matter,

65
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,342
Getting your dick
sucked by a girl

66
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,109
Probably feels
the same as a guy.

67
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:38,145
Besides, it's not like
he's butt-fucking you,

68
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:40,180
Although I'm sure you
offered that, too.

69
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:42,950
You can say whatever
you want to, darling.

70
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:45,786
But the truth is,
you're terrible.

71
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:47,555
That's why you
don't get the parts.

72
00:04:47,588 --> 00:04:48,489
Oh yeah?

73
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:50,290
Yeah, what are you, like 40?

74
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:53,193
I'm barely 30, idiot.

75
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:56,497
Okay, let's see here.

76
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,665
Oh, Tracy.

77
00:04:57,698 --> 00:04:59,933
Hey baby, come on in.

78
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,201
Um, ma'am?

79
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,736
We were here first.

80
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,905
Sorry sweetie, but the
producer specifically

81
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:07,341
Requested her for this one.

82
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,976
I'm sure they did.

83
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,678
Yeah, sorry sweetie.

84
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:13,347
Eat your heart out.

85
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:17,985
What a bitch.

86
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:20,521
I know right?

87
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,864
(Car alarm unlock tweets)

88
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:58,392
(Shrill static)

89
00:06:16,444 --> 00:06:18,211
Shit.

90
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,616
(Knocking)

91
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:57,551
Eesha.

92
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,188
Novi!

93
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:02,389
Hi, Eesha.

94
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,125
How are you, I just
saw you coming in.

95
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:07,027
I'm good, how is Jethro doing?

96
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,863
Oh, he's doing fine,
he just has started

97
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:14,001
Picking on his privates so I
had to put the cone back on.

98
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:17,137
It must be strange to
have your privates cut off

99
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,306
Like that, you know?

100
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:20,941
Poor little guy.

101
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:26,013
Yeah, so did you have
any auditions or callbacks?

102
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:28,315
Yeah, I had some
auditions today.

103
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:30,083
How did they go?

104
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,586
Good, you know, we'll see.

105
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,589
I just wanted to know
how your month was going,

106
00:07:35,623 --> 00:07:39,092
It's almost the end of
the month, you know?

107
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:41,929
Mmm-hmm, yeah,
time sure flies by.

108
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:45,065
It sure does, yeah,
it just seems like

109
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:47,334
Last month just ended.

110
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:48,569
Sure does.

111
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:49,837
Mmm-hmm.

112
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,404
Yeah.

113
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:54,374
Well um, have a good night.

114
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:55,876
You too, bye Jethro.

115
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:58,478
Say bye-bye Jethro,
come on, say bye-bye.

116
00:07:58,512 --> 00:07:59,780
Bye-bye.

117
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,615
Oh, bye-bye, he's
saying bye-bye.

118
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:02,516
Okay.

119
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,485
Oh, bye-bye, oh bye-bye.

120
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:10,691
(Phone vibrates)

121
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:15,563
Hello?

122
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:18,431
Oh hey, what's up?

123
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:20,467
Yeah.

124
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,735
Sure.

125
00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:24,004
I'll see you there in 20.

126
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:32,580
Eh, I'll tell you
about it later.

127
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,749
Okay, yeah, sounds good.

128
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:37,618
Cool.

129
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:40,621
See you then, bye.

130
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,259
Whatever.

131
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:49,697
So then the casting
director comes out,

132
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,599
Doesn't even look at
the sign-in sheet,

133
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:53,400
And lets Tracy audition.

134
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:54,802
She didn't even
look at the list.

135
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:56,436
Is she the bitch that got
the commercial over you?

136
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:57,838
Not just the
commercial, but like,

137
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,373
The last four or five
roles I've tried out for.

138
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:01,408
I hate her.

139
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:02,810
Was she that good?

140
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:05,212
I don't know, I haven't
seen any of her shit.

141
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:07,080
Well, is she really
hot or something?

142
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:08,548
No.

143
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:10,283
I mean she's cute, but not like

144
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:12,152
Out-of-this-world beautiful.

145
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:13,320
Right.

146
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:14,487
And she's got like
this snaggletooth.

147
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:15,656
Oh, gross.

148
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:17,057
She's younger, that's
mostly the reason.

149
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,491
Well how young?

150
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:20,828
I don't know, early 20s.

151
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:23,631
Whatever it says on my headshot.

152
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:30,503
Look Novi, I know that
this has been really tough

153
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:32,072
For you, okay?

154
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:33,941
But you're a really good
actress, and I think

155
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:35,943
That you just need
to tough this out.

156
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:36,910
Candice, I haven't
gotten a part

157
00:09:36,944 --> 00:09:38,445
In the last three years.

158
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:40,413
Nothing, not even
a corporate video.

159
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:43,050
Well you're not trying to
do a corporate video, Novi.

160
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,118
I mean you're trying
to become a movie star

161
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:47,921
So that you can fuck
Michael Fasbecker.

162
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:49,556
Candice I can't get anything.

163
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,558
So what, are you
gonna quit, just because

164
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,093
You're going through
a rough patch?

165
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:55,095
A rough patch is three
weeks or three months,

166
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:57,097
Not three years.

167
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,199
I think that you should
give it a couple more weeks.

168
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:01,969
I mean, it's always
darkest right before

169
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:03,503
The sun comes up.

170
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:04,772
It's before the dawn.

171
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:06,273
What?

172
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:08,441
Nothing.

173
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,411
So, you girls wanna
dance or something?

174
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,280
It's Candice and Novella, right?

175
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:14,481
Why don't you go
grab me another drink?

176
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:16,283
Another one?

177
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:18,618
You haven't said two
words to me all night.

178
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:20,888
Well, I'm sorry
baby, but you know,

179
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:22,155
We've just been
talking about some

180
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:24,091
Really serious shit
over here, you know?

181
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,526
Yeah, sounds like it.

182
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,961
You know what?

183
00:10:27,995 --> 00:10:29,629
If you go get me another
drink I'll make it up to you,

184
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:32,465
I promise, I'm just
starting to get my buzz on.

185
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:35,703
Yeah, great.

186
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:42,042
Look, I have a gun
right here in my purse,

187
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:43,143
And I'm not afraid to
shoot your dick off

188
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:45,545
Right now on this couch.

189
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:46,980
But if you go get
me and my girlfriend

190
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:48,548
Another drink, I'll be
happy to make it up to you

191
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:52,452
With a handjob in the bathroom.

192
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,655
So now which one of those
scenarios would you prefer?

193
00:10:57,024 --> 00:11:00,393
Hmm?

194
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,998
Baby girl, do you
want another drink?

195
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:06,633
Yep.

196
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:10,537
Hey, Louis CK, yeah, you.

197
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:13,573
You wanna get my girl
a vodka and soda?

198
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:14,942
Yes, sir.

199
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:17,410
Thanks.

200
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:19,512
Are you ready?

201
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,414
Yeah.

202
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,188
Shit, you know
what, I've gotta pee,

203
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:29,656
I'll be like two seconds, okay?

204
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,358
Can't you wait,
we're on our way out.

205
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:32,960
Novi, I've already
like, broken the seal,

206
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:35,128
I mean that dipshit just
bought me like, four beers.

207
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:36,363
I'll be right back.

208
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:37,597
Well hurry up,
I don't feel good.

209
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,799
Okay, I'll be right
back, but just watch out

210
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:41,034
For Ren and Stimpy, okay?

211
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:03,723
How's it goin'?

212
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,197
What's your name?

213
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,565
Novella.

214
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:14,167
Are you an actress?

215
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:15,368
Why do you ask?

216
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,437
You have a movie star name.

217
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,207
Thanks.

218
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,409
What's your last name?

219
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:23,777
McClure.

220
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:25,145
Really?

221
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:28,381
That's an incredible name.

222
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:29,616
What do you do?

223
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:31,384
I'm an actress.

224
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,353
Seriously?

225
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:36,023
I knew it, you're
beautiful and skinny,

226
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:38,691
You have an amazing name.

227
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:39,659
Don't worry I'm not
gonna friend you

228
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:40,994
On Facebook or anything.

229
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:42,762
Oh, good.

230
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:44,932
So uh, what's your
name and occupation?

231
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:46,066
Me?

232
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:49,803
Um, my name is
Simon, I am a doctor.

233
00:12:49,837 --> 00:12:51,371
Call me Dr. Simon if you want.

234
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:53,040
That's what I call myself, so.

235
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:54,141
Are you really a doctor?

236
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:55,508
I am.

237
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:58,178
So, do you save
people's lives and stuff?

238
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:00,580
I do, if you
consider saving lives

239
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:04,117
Talking to rich people
about how bored they are.

240
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:05,552
Mmm, not so much.

241
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:07,087
Yeah, me neither.

242
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,488
I usually just tell
people I'm a surgeon,

243
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:11,158
But, I don't know, you
bring out the truth in me.

244
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:14,127
I have that effect on people.

245
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:17,464
Maybe you should just
change your name to Polly.

246
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,166
What?

247
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:21,068
Like a polygraph test?

248
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:24,237
Okay.

249
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:27,440
Yeah, it's a lie
detector test, yeah.

250
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:31,111
I was really going 'til
that last one, huh?

251
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:34,481
Yeah, it kinda came
out of left field.

252
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:41,321
Uh, speaking of which,
looks like I'm up to bat, so.

253
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:43,790
You have a boyfriend
or something?

254
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,658
Hey, let's go.

255
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:47,160
Come on.

256
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:48,761
Nice to meet you, Dr. Simon.

257
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:51,131
You too.

258
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,069
Novella McClure.

259
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:03,911
(Loud bang)

260
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:33,340
Ugh.

261
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:37,978
Oh, my god this is so stupid.

262
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,898
Shit.

263
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:39,406
Oh, fuck, that's right.

264
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:01,694
Hi there.

265
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:02,729
What's your name?

266
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:04,131
Novella McClure.

267
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:06,066
Miss McClure, I was
hoping you'd make it out.

268
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:07,667
Oh, really?

269
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,169
Are you a casting agent?

270
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:10,903
Oh no, I'm just
helping out today.

271
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:13,040
Oh, well thanks,
I'm happy to be here.

272
00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:15,575
Ha ha, I'm sorry,
what I meant was,

273
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:20,047
I've seen you before, and
you have a great look.

274
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,049
Do you do any modeling?

275
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:24,817
Of course I do modeling,
are you looking for models?

276
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:26,753
A friend of mine
has a company, and is

277
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:28,755
Looking for some new faces.

278
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:30,023
He's really talented.

279
00:16:30,057 --> 00:16:31,958
Oh, well what's the
name of the company?

280
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,293
Oh, well I'm
not sure, but he's

281
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,995
A really great photographer
and film maker.

282
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:37,464
Where's it based out of?

283
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,599
I think he said San Fernando.

284
00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:42,469
Look sweetie, I'm not stupid.

285
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,437
No thanks.

286
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:46,406
I'm sorry, did I
say something wrong?

287
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,376
I don't do porn.

288
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:50,610
What?

289
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:51,778
This is not my first
audition, I've been

290
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:53,246
Doing this for a while now.

291
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,681
I don't know what
you're talking about.

292
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:56,083
Any modeling company
that doesn't tell you

293
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:58,385
The name of the company
is a porn company.

294
00:16:58,418 --> 00:16:59,786
No it's not.

295
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:01,020
Then what's the name of it?

296
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:02,389
Well, I don't remember.

297
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:03,690
Have you seen his work?

298
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:05,858
Well, no but I've
been dating the guy

299
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:07,594
For a few weeks,
and I think that...

300
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:09,196
Ah, see there you go.

301
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:10,630
He knows that you're
interning here

302
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:12,699
And asked you to collect
headshots and shit, right?

303
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:15,168
Yeah, but it's
not a porn company.

304
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:17,404
Has he asked you to audition?

305
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:18,338
Yeah, but that'd...

306
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:19,472
You see, there you go.

307
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:21,374
Stop it, he doesn't
do porn, okay?

308
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:26,279
Besides, you're the
one with the porn name.

309
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:27,514
What the hell does that mean?

310
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,882
Well maybe the reason
people keep trying

311
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,051
To cast you in their
porn movies is because

312
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:32,852
Of your stupid name.

313
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,087
It's not stupid.

314
00:17:34,121 --> 00:17:35,722
What, was Laura Lust
taken or something?

315
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:37,490
A porn name is your
pet's name, and the street

316
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:38,691
You grew up on.

317
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:41,361
Do you really think I'd
name my cat Novella?

318
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,062
Oh fuck me, are you serious?

319
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:44,364
Be sure to grab her
headshot, she'd love to

320
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,233
Fuck your boyfriend on camera.

321
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:47,534
Excuse me?

322
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:50,803
Fuck off, Tracy.

323
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:53,773
Uh!

324
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:55,842
Hi, I'm Tracy Armstrong.

325
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:59,446
Did you need me to sign in?

326
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:41,087
Oh shit!

327
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,656
Fuck!

328
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:55,001
Dammit.

329
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:05,044
(Novella breathed raggedly)

330
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:11,184
(Knocking)

331
00:19:11,218 --> 00:19:13,320
God dammit!

332
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:17,990
Oh, hi Novi, how are you?

333
00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:19,426
Eesha can you come back
another time, this isn't

334
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:20,827
Really a good time.

335
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,129
Well, I just don't know
how to tell you this.

336
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,598
What is it?

337
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:27,434
Oh shit.

338
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:28,868
Novi, I have been
trying to tell you this

339
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,438
For three months to pay your
rent but you haven't paid.

340
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:33,573
I know Eesha, it's not
your fault, it's mine.

341
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:36,709
I'm sorry, look, I'll
get you a check, okay?

342
00:19:36,743 --> 00:19:38,878
I'm up for a big role
and I'm pretty sure

343
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,247
I'm gonna get the part.

344
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,081
Novi, you have been
saying that since February,

345
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:44,050
And so far you haven't
paid your rent, you know

346
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,952
I hate doing this.

347
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:47,153
I know it, I just...

348
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,821
Oh Novi, no look,
don't start crying.

349
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,690
What happened?!

350
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:52,359
I was in a car accident.

351
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:55,362
And I had to get a,
a car, a rental car

352
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:58,365
Just to, I had to get a
rental car to come home

353
00:19:58,398 --> 00:20:01,768
And then go to my audition,
and now I'm being evicted

354
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:03,770
And I don't have any
money, and I just

355
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:05,905
Don't have any place to stay.

356
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,907
Okay wait, don't,
don't cry, listen,

357
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,377
Don't worry, look,
look, just sit here

358
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,612
And we'll take care
of your hand, okay?

359
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:15,482
I'll go get some cleaner.

360
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:24,624
(Ominous background noise)

361
00:21:19,546 --> 00:21:23,115
(Heart monitor beeping)

362
00:21:53,212 --> 00:21:55,482
Good morning, how
are you feeling?

363
00:21:55,515 --> 00:21:57,049
You've been out all night.

364
00:21:57,083 --> 00:22:00,152
The medication should make you
feel pretty groggy right now.

365
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:02,589
How are you feeling?

366
00:22:02,622 --> 00:22:03,823
Groggy.

367
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:05,458
Okay.

368
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:07,326
I'll go grab the doctor
and I'll send her right in.

369
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,695
No, that's not necessary.

370
00:22:08,728 --> 00:22:10,563
I'll just grab my stuff
and go home, I'm okay.

371
00:22:10,597 --> 00:22:12,465
Oh, no no, you've
had quite the night.

372
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:15,034
No please, I'm not
a fan of doctors.

373
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:16,869
I don't trust them.

374
00:22:16,903 --> 00:22:18,805
No offense, you're not a
doctor, so you're cool.

375
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:23,410
Okay, just sit back and
relax, and I'll send her in.

376
00:22:25,478 --> 00:22:26,345
Fuck.

377
00:22:26,379 --> 00:22:29,181
This is gonna be expensive.

378
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:32,284
(Knocking)

379
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:38,758
Hello, Novella,
how are you feeling?

380
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:40,092
Groggy.

381
00:22:40,126 --> 00:22:41,494
That's probably
the medication.

382
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:42,962
That's what I hear.

383
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:44,397
My name is Dr. Morgan Walker.

384
00:22:44,431 --> 00:22:46,533
I'm the psychiatrist
here at the hospital.

385
00:22:46,566 --> 00:22:47,967
Excuse me?

386
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,369
I came to talk to
you about your wrist.

387
00:22:50,403 --> 00:22:52,539
Psychiatrist?

388
00:22:52,572 --> 00:22:54,541
Your friend Eesha
brought you in.

389
00:22:54,574 --> 00:22:55,875
She told me you might
be going through

390
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:58,578
A tough financial situation.

391
00:22:58,611 --> 00:23:01,581
So I have Eesha
to thank for this?

392
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:02,915
She saved your life.

393
00:23:02,949 --> 00:23:04,083
Right.

394
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:06,152
Look Dr. Walker,
I'm not suicidal.

395
00:23:06,185 --> 00:23:08,921
In fact, it's a
really weird story.

396
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:10,122
Really?

397
00:23:10,156 --> 00:23:11,357
Yeah, would you like
me to tell you about it?

398
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,125
Please.

399
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:15,628
Okay well, yesterday
when Eesha left,

400
00:23:15,662 --> 00:23:17,329
Well I got nervous, and
whenever I get nervous,

401
00:23:17,363 --> 00:23:20,066
I get hungry.

402
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:21,400
Does this happen often?

403
00:23:21,434 --> 00:23:22,902
Yeah.

404
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:27,807
So, well, and I got
a can of peaches out.

405
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,908
Peaches?

406
00:23:28,941 --> 00:23:30,843
Yes, peaches, to eat.

407
00:23:30,877 --> 00:23:35,882
Because I was hungry,
and, well, I love peaches.

408
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:40,987
And when I was opening
up the can of p-peaches,

409
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:44,457
I s-s-sliced and slipped on...

410
00:23:46,192 --> 00:23:48,495
Yeah.

411
00:23:58,104 --> 00:23:59,572
Okay, Novella.

412
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:02,274
I'm going to put you on
24-hour suicide watch.

413
00:24:02,308 --> 00:24:04,511
Do you have any friends or
family who can stay with you?

414
00:24:04,544 --> 00:24:06,012
I don't know.

415
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:10,449
Miss, I mean Dr. Walker, I'm not
suicidal, I just told you, I...

416
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:15,021
Miss McClure, the wound
on your hand is a bite mark.

417
00:24:15,054 --> 00:24:16,556
The first responders
thought it might be

418
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:18,958
From an animal, but the
blood caked on your face,

419
00:24:18,991 --> 00:24:23,663
And pieces of flesh in your
teeth, proved otherwise.

420
00:24:23,696 --> 00:24:26,933
You must have a friend or
family member stay with you.

421
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:29,235
If not, you'll be
required to stay here.

422
00:24:29,268 --> 00:24:31,170
And I also want
to give you this.

423
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:34,006
It's for the psychiatric
facility up the street.

424
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,908
You must meet with
a psychiatrist there

425
00:24:35,942 --> 00:24:39,211
Two times a week until
further evaluation.

426
00:24:39,245 --> 00:24:41,313
Is this clear?

427
00:24:42,248 --> 00:24:43,816
Novella.

428
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:46,185
We're trying to help you.

429
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:48,855
You don't need to lie to us.

430
00:24:48,888 --> 00:24:50,189
Now I'm gonna send the
nurse in and get you

431
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:52,825
All cleaned up and ready to go.

432
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:02,334
Fuck!

433
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:11,310
So then I go and check
out, and it's gonna cost me

434
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,512
2200 dollars for
one night's stay.

435
00:25:13,546 --> 00:25:15,882
Why did she say it
looked like an animal bite?

436
00:25:15,915 --> 00:25:17,349
She's a lying bitch.

437
00:25:17,383 --> 00:25:18,618
All doctors are.

438
00:25:18,651 --> 00:25:20,052
I was opening up a can
and slipped and now

439
00:25:20,086 --> 00:25:21,353
I have to go see
a god damn shrink

440
00:25:21,387 --> 00:25:23,255
In an insane asylum.

441
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:24,824
Don't worry about
it so much baby girl,

442
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:26,959
I'll stay the night
at your place tonight.

443
00:25:26,993 --> 00:25:28,460
We'll make the most out of it,

444
00:25:28,494 --> 00:25:30,162
I actually think
it'll be kind of fun.

445
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:31,831
Candice, I don't have a place.

446
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,566
I'm being evicted.

447
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,001
Are you kidding me?

448
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:36,435
Just tell your landlady that
you tried to kill yourself

449
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:38,137
Because of her.

450
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,806
You've got her wrapped
around your finger.

451
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:41,941
My apartment is
attached to her house.

452
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:44,243
I don't think she's gonna
let me live there for free.

453
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:46,312
Well she has been for
the past three months,

454
00:25:46,345 --> 00:25:49,048
I think you should
just trust me on this.

455
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:51,684
I don't know, I feel bad.

456
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:53,753
I get off work at seven,
I think you just need

457
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:55,321
To talk to your
landlady and everything

458
00:25:55,354 --> 00:25:57,189
Will work itself out.

459
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:59,525
Okay?

460
00:25:59,926 --> 00:26:01,127
Hey!

461
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,262
Suicide watch, come
on it'll be fun!

462
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:05,497
Buck up!

463
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,553
(Stomach growling)

464
00:26:44,003 --> 00:26:46,605
Dammit.

465
00:26:49,475 --> 00:26:53,579
(Phone dialing tones)

466
00:26:54,981 --> 00:26:57,049
Thank you for
calling Sun City Bank.

(Phone vibrating)

473
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:25,477
Hello?

474
00:27:25,511 --> 00:27:26,813
Is this Novella?

475
00:27:26,846 --> 00:27:28,014
Yes it is.

476
00:27:28,047 --> 00:27:29,348
Hi, my name's Brad Hatcher.

477
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:30,549
I'm a film maker
here in Los Angeles

478
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:31,718
And I was calling
because my girlfriend

479
00:27:31,751 --> 00:27:33,452
Gave me your head shot today.

480
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,554
Oh, cool, who's
your girlfriend?

481
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:37,724
Uh, the one you
yelled at yesterday.

482
00:27:37,757 --> 00:27:41,260
Oh wow, umm, I'm surprised
she gave it to you,

483
00:27:41,293 --> 00:27:43,129
I was pretty nasty to her.

484
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:45,431
Me too, actually, but we
all have shitty days, right?

485
00:27:45,464 --> 00:27:47,233
Tell me about it.

486
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:48,735
Well, my producers and
I are putting together

487
00:27:48,768 --> 00:27:50,602
A small scene and we
all think you have

488
00:27:50,636 --> 00:27:51,804
The perfect look for it.

489
00:27:51,838 --> 00:27:53,239
We'd really like to
talk with you in person,

490
00:27:53,272 --> 00:27:55,875
Um, would you be interested
in coming in to audition?

491
00:27:55,908 --> 00:27:58,177
You know, honestly Brad,
I really appreciate it,

492
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,912
But I've been thinking
about taking some time off

493
00:27:59,946 --> 00:28:01,547
For a while now.

494
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,350
I don't know if she mentioned
this, but it's a paying role.

495
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:06,018
Oh really, how much?

496
00:28:06,052 --> 00:28:09,521
It's 1500 dollars
for a four-hour scene.

497
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:12,191
Did you just say 1500 dollars?

498
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:14,260
I did, will that work for you?

499
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:17,029
Yeah, uh, when and
where is the audition?

500
00:28:17,063 --> 00:28:19,065
It's at our production
studio in the Valley.

501
00:28:19,098 --> 00:28:20,867
I can text you the
address if you want.

502
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,069
Okay, great,
I'll see you there.

503
00:28:23,102 --> 00:28:24,670
Great, thanks Novella.

504
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,572
Oh, uh, real quick, is this
your current email address

505
00:28:26,605 --> 00:28:28,274
On the back of your headshot?

506
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:29,708
Uh, yes it is.

507
00:28:29,742 --> 00:28:31,077
Okay cool, I'm gonna send
you some more information

508
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,212
About our films and uh,
any reference materials

509
00:28:33,245 --> 00:28:35,882
You may need, otherwise,
we will see you tomorrow.

510
00:28:35,915 --> 00:28:38,985
Okay, thanks Brad.

511
00:28:51,263 --> 00:28:53,800
Hmm.

512
00:28:56,668 --> 00:29:01,673
(Airy piano music)

513
00:30:33,132 --> 00:30:34,433
(Knocking)

514
00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:37,303
Ow, fuck.

515
00:30:44,743 --> 00:30:47,346
Oh, um, hi Novi.

516
00:30:47,379 --> 00:30:48,380
How are you?

517
00:30:48,414 --> 00:30:49,848
Hey, Eesha, I'm fine.

518
00:30:49,882 --> 00:30:51,350
Sweetie, what happened?

519
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:53,152
Oh, they let me go from
the hospital this morning,

520
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:55,221
And I'm just waiting
for my friend Candice.

521
00:30:55,254 --> 00:30:56,155
She should be here soon.

522
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:57,589
(Jethro barks)

523
00:30:57,623 --> 00:30:59,892
No no no, I mean, why did
you do this to yourself?

524
00:30:59,926 --> 00:31:01,693
(Jethro whining)

525
00:31:01,727 --> 00:31:06,165
I don't know, I, I
just have a lot of things

526
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:07,699
Going on right now.

527
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:10,202
You know Novi, don't
worry about your rent.

528
00:31:10,236 --> 00:31:12,738
Oh no, Eesha, I'll
pay you the rent.

529
00:31:12,771 --> 00:31:14,540
You are very special
to me and I don't know

530
00:31:14,573 --> 00:31:17,743
What I will do if
anything happened to you.

531
00:31:17,776 --> 00:31:18,677
Thanks, Eesha.

532
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,179
You are very talented.

533
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:22,748
And one day you will
be a big movie star.

534
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:25,317
You don't need this
stress in your life.

535
00:31:25,351 --> 00:31:26,585
(Jethro barks)

536
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:29,655
What's going on, what
are you wanting there?

537
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:31,223
Awww!

538
00:31:31,257 --> 00:31:34,326
Oh my god, you are so cute!

539
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,727
Little baby!

540
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:37,296
Uh, Eesha, this is
my friend Candice.

541
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:39,131
Candice this is my
landlady, Eesha.

542
00:31:39,165 --> 00:31:39,865
Hi.

543
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,300
Oh, hi.

544
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:44,203
He likes you, oh
otherwise he turns into

545
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:46,805
A little ball of barb wire.

546
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:48,975
Oh he's precious.

547
00:31:49,008 --> 00:31:52,311
Well, you can keep
him if you want to.

548
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:54,981
Ever since he got his
testicles chopped off,

549
00:31:55,014 --> 00:31:57,916
He's been quite a handful.

550
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:02,754
Oh, yeah, I don't know,
I think he's pretty sweet.

551
00:32:02,788 --> 00:32:04,991
Oh well I'll leave
you two by yourselves.

552
00:32:05,024 --> 00:32:06,358
Take care, Novi.

553
00:32:06,392 --> 00:32:07,159
Thanks Eesha.

554
00:32:07,193 --> 00:32:08,327
Mmm-hmm.

555
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,228
It was really
nice to meet you.

556
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:11,030
Oh, nice to meet you too.

557
00:32:11,063 --> 00:32:14,066
And you too, handsome
little man, you say bye-bye?

558
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,501
Say bye.

559
00:32:15,534 --> 00:32:17,636
Oh my god, so precious,
have a good day.

560
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:18,670
You too.

561
00:32:18,704 --> 00:32:19,705
Bye.

562
00:32:19,738 --> 00:32:21,540
Adorable, oh my god.

563
00:32:21,573 --> 00:32:24,143
So cute.

564
00:32:29,015 --> 00:32:30,749
So what do you
want to do tonight?

565
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,784
Ugh, I need a drink.

566
00:32:32,818 --> 00:32:35,287
Sounds good to me.

567
00:32:35,321 --> 00:32:36,655
Wait a second.

568
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:37,789
Should we be going
out after you just

569
00:32:37,823 --> 00:32:39,158
Tried to kill
yourself or whatever?

570
00:32:39,191 --> 00:32:40,292
Are you kidding me,
that's exactly why

571
00:32:40,326 --> 00:32:41,727
We should go out.

572
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,097
That's my girl.

573
00:32:45,131 --> 00:32:46,732
I'm gonna go get ready.

574
00:32:46,765 --> 00:32:49,068
Wait, do you have a
dress that I can borrow?

575
00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:55,107
(Club music)

576
00:33:22,134 --> 00:33:23,402
So are we gonna
dance at all tonight?

577
00:33:23,435 --> 00:33:25,537
Baby, I was just dancing.

578
00:33:25,571 --> 00:33:27,239
Yeah, but not with me.

579
00:33:27,273 --> 00:33:29,575
What, you don't like to watch?

580
00:33:29,608 --> 00:33:32,678
I bet you like to
watch, don't you?

581
00:33:33,912 --> 00:33:35,381
You wanna get out of here?

582
00:33:35,414 --> 00:33:38,350
I live really close.

583
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,187
I think that cast
on your arm is hot.

584
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,522
I kinda wanna lick it.

585
00:33:43,555 --> 00:33:45,357
Um, I could use a drink.

586
00:33:45,391 --> 00:33:46,492
Yeah.

587
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:48,560
I could use another drink, too.

588
00:33:48,594 --> 00:33:51,297
Why don't you boys go get
us another round, okay?

589
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:52,698
Yeah yeah, but you know
I'm not gonna do this

590
00:33:52,731 --> 00:33:54,666
All night for free,
you know what I mean,

591
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,835
Not for your health, baby.

592
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,737
Yeah, that's really charming.

593
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:01,473
You know what,
make mine a double.

594
00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:05,211
These guys are
especially douchey.

595
00:34:05,244 --> 00:34:06,378
I think we should
just get another drink

596
00:34:06,412 --> 00:34:08,947
And then we should roll out.

597
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:11,283
Are you okay?

598
00:34:11,317 --> 00:34:12,851
I have my last
audition tomorrow.

599
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:13,652
What?

600
00:34:13,685 --> 00:34:14,886
I'm quitting acting.

601
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,987
God, not this again,
I mean can't we just

602
00:34:16,021 --> 00:34:17,389
Get drunk and have some fun?

603
00:34:17,423 --> 00:34:19,225
Candice, I'm serious,
if I get it, I'll get

604
00:34:19,258 --> 00:34:21,059
1500 dollars, and
I'll stick with it.

605
00:34:21,093 --> 00:34:22,161
If not, I'm done.

606
00:34:22,194 --> 00:34:23,229
Really?

607
00:34:23,262 --> 00:34:24,830
What are you gonna do?

608
00:34:24,863 --> 00:34:26,898
I can cut hair with you.

609
00:34:26,932 --> 00:34:27,999
At my shop?

610
00:34:28,033 --> 00:34:29,435
Yeah.

611
00:34:29,468 --> 00:34:31,002
Why would you want to work
there, I hate that place.

612
00:34:31,036 --> 00:34:33,172
Because you make
money and I don't.

613
00:34:33,205 --> 00:34:35,141
I think that you're
doing just fine.

614
00:34:35,174 --> 00:34:37,042
I mean look how nice
your apartment is.

615
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,644
Candice, I got evicted.

616
00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:39,878
No you didn't.

617
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,913
Now you can just keep
doing what you love.

618
00:34:41,947 --> 00:34:43,382
Candice, I don't love it.

619
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:45,517
I don't love sitting in a
room full of pretty girls,

620
00:34:45,551 --> 00:34:47,119
Girls who would literally
kill me just so they

621
00:34:47,153 --> 00:34:48,420
Could have the part.

622
00:34:48,454 --> 00:34:49,955
You're just paying your dues.

623
00:34:49,988 --> 00:34:51,557
Paying my dues?

624
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,759
It's all dues, it's only dues.

625
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:56,428
I've been paying my dues
for the last 10 years.

626
00:34:56,462 --> 00:35:00,166
Baby girl, you're
like my blood, okay?

627
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:02,368
I just don't have
your back on this.

628
00:35:02,401 --> 00:35:04,503
I just can't let you
give up on your dream.

629
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:06,705
My dream is to be happy.

630
00:35:06,738 --> 00:35:10,142
And I haven't been
happy in a long time.

631
00:35:10,176 --> 00:35:13,078
Especially lately.

632
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,980
You know, I sit in
that shop all day long

633
00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:19,318
Cutting hair while everyone
else is out in the world.

634
00:35:19,351 --> 00:35:20,786
And that's why I've
always loved you

635
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:22,788
And respected you, Novi.

636
00:35:22,821 --> 00:35:25,056
Because you didn't give
up like I did, I mean,

637
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:28,560
You fight and you claw
and you struggle every day

638
00:35:28,594 --> 00:35:31,297
So that you can keep
living your dream.

639
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:33,965
Meanwhile, I sit in
a fucking box all day

640
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:36,868
Cutting the hair of people
who are total assholes

641
00:35:36,902 --> 00:35:40,306
And making them look pretty.

642
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:44,610
Here's your double,
you'll like that one.

643
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:47,513
Oh, thanks.

644
00:35:47,546 --> 00:35:51,183
Uh, gimma peck
on the cheek first.

645
00:35:51,217 --> 00:35:53,719
Are you serious?

646
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,488
Hey what the fuck?!

647
00:35:56,522 --> 00:35:58,490
Get off me!

648
00:35:58,524 --> 00:35:59,391
Cheers!

649
00:35:59,425 --> 00:36:02,160
Okay, sorry.

650
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:09,935
You know what,
um, I've gotta pee.

651
00:36:09,968 --> 00:36:12,238
Yup, me too.

652
00:36:12,271 --> 00:36:13,739
Excuse me.

653
00:36:13,772 --> 00:36:15,607
Don't be gone too long.

654
00:36:15,641 --> 00:36:18,644
You'll make me sad.

655
00:36:22,581 --> 00:36:24,716
Are um, are you good?

656
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,885
Yeah, I hate that bathroom.

657
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:29,955
Okay, I'll b-r-b.

658
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,862
Hey.

659
00:36:36,895 --> 00:36:39,030
Oh, hey Dr. Simon.

660
00:36:39,064 --> 00:36:40,332
How are you, Novella?

661
00:36:40,366 --> 00:36:42,100
You remembered my name.

662
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:43,802
Of course, how could I
forget the one and only

663
00:36:43,835 --> 00:36:46,338
Novella McClure?

664
00:36:46,372 --> 00:36:47,939
By the way, I don't actually
have to go to the bathroom,

665
00:36:47,973 --> 00:36:51,109
I just, I saw you over here.

666
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:52,344
Alright.

667
00:36:52,378 --> 00:36:53,512
Last time, I had to
go to the bathroom,

668
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:57,148
But now we're standing
here, how are you?

669
00:36:58,016 --> 00:36:59,618
[Awkward laugh]
I'm okay.

670
00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:00,986
Great.

671
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:03,522
What happened to your hand?

672
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,824
Oh, car accident.

673
00:37:05,857 --> 00:37:06,958
How bad?

674
00:37:06,992 --> 00:37:08,327
This bad.

675
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,662
Wow, yeah.

676
00:37:10,696 --> 00:37:13,031
Uh, hey so, before your
scary girlfriend comes back,

677
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:17,135
I wanted to ask you out.

678
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:20,071
Oh, wow, you just kinda
came out and said it.

679
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:22,508
Yeah, I sure did, didn't I?

680
00:37:22,541 --> 00:37:24,476
I'm about as shocked as you are.

681
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:27,713
Um, what do you think?

682
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:29,981
Go get a cup of coffee,
or eat food together

683
00:37:30,015 --> 00:37:31,417
Or something.

684
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:33,352
Um, sure, I'm kind
of drunk right now,

685
00:37:33,385 --> 00:37:35,086
So it might not
be the best time.

686
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,254
Oh yeah yeah, of course.

687
00:37:36,288 --> 00:37:37,389
I didn't mean tonight,
I actually have

688
00:37:37,423 --> 00:37:41,092
A new patient in
the morning, so.

689
00:37:41,126 --> 00:37:42,561
I will give you my number.

690
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:45,364
That way you don't have to
call if you don't want to.

691
00:37:45,397 --> 00:37:47,999
It's a win-win situation
for you, you know?

692
00:37:48,033 --> 00:37:51,069
Well I appreciate the
option, but I will call.

693
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,038
Great.

694
00:37:53,071 --> 00:37:54,673
So what, you're boyfriend's...

695
00:37:54,706 --> 00:37:57,275
Oh god no, they're
just a tab for the night.

696
00:37:57,309 --> 00:37:59,010
Really?

697
00:37:59,044 --> 00:38:01,947
That's probably not the
safest way to get a drink.

698
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,649
It's the cheapest though.

699
00:38:03,682 --> 00:38:05,417
(Laughing)

700
00:38:05,451 --> 00:38:06,952
Just so you know,
if we do go out,

701
00:38:06,985 --> 00:38:09,488
You can have whatever you want.

702
00:38:09,521 --> 00:38:12,424
You don't have to slip out
back afterwards, either.

703
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:14,660
Sounds like a good plan to me.

704
00:38:14,693 --> 00:38:17,596
Okay, well I'm going to
quit while I'm still ahead.

705
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:19,765
I will call you
soon, Dr. Simon.

706
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:21,833
Talk to you then.

707
00:38:22,534 --> 00:38:25,203
Novella McClure.

708
00:38:47,292 --> 00:38:48,494
(Muffled voice from bathroom)

709
00:38:48,527 --> 00:38:50,962
Yeah, and now you can
go, just like I said.

710
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:52,130
[Bathroom girl] It
took you long enough,

711
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,298
Did you get it all?

712
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,466
You wanna take
it outside, bitch?

713
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,601
[Bathroom girl]
Fuck off, bitch!

714
00:38:55,634 --> 00:38:57,135
That's what I thought.

715
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,570
Fucking bitch.

716
00:38:58,604 --> 00:38:59,905
Everything okay?

717
00:38:59,938 --> 00:39:01,106
Yeah, it's fine,
there's just some hipster

718
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:02,408
Bitch in the bathroom
starting shit.

719
00:39:02,441 --> 00:39:05,343
Let's just go, come on.

720
00:39:06,044 --> 00:39:09,881
Uh, do you remember what...

721
00:39:09,915 --> 00:39:11,316
I know where the
car is, come here.

722
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,652
It's this way.

723
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,721
Oh.

724
00:39:15,754 --> 00:39:17,689
Those guys were
like stupid douchey.

725
00:39:17,723 --> 00:39:18,857
Well they were assholes.

726
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:21,660
Dude, I feel pretty
drunk right now.

727
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:23,294
Are you okay to drive?

728
00:39:23,328 --> 00:39:26,064
Yeah I just, well I
don't know, I feel kind of

729
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:28,500
Fucked up, but just
give me the key.

730
00:39:30,902 --> 00:39:32,471
Shit.

731
00:39:32,504 --> 00:39:34,305
Me too.

732
00:39:34,339 --> 00:39:37,175
Oh, shit.

733
00:39:38,677 --> 00:39:43,682
(Muffled background noise)

734
00:39:46,284 --> 00:39:50,188
Something's wrong.

735
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,557
There you are!

736
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:52,791
Ha ha ha ha!

737
00:39:52,824 --> 00:39:54,325
I told you not to run
away from me, Stumpy.

738
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:56,227
Candice, shit, we
have to get out of here!

739
00:39:56,261 --> 00:39:57,295
We've been buying
you little girls drinks

740
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:58,497
All night long.

741
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:00,666
And here you are,
trying to run out on us.

742
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:03,034
Ron kind of figured
you were gonna do that.

743
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:04,069
I thought you might
need a little something,

744
00:40:04,102 --> 00:40:06,337
Extra, to get you in the mood.

745
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:07,906
Extra, extra!

746
00:40:07,939 --> 00:40:09,575
It'll be okay baby girl, okay?

747
00:40:09,608 --> 00:40:12,010
So remember when I said
I wanted to lick you?

748
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:14,412
Well now you are gonna lick me.

749
00:40:14,446 --> 00:40:17,449
Rub along those teeth like
that, just brushin' 'em...

750
00:40:17,483 --> 00:40:18,850
Do what he says, okay?

751
00:40:18,884 --> 00:40:20,285
What?!

752
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:21,419
I like this one.

753
00:40:21,453 --> 00:40:22,688
Fuck yeah!

754
00:40:22,721 --> 00:40:25,223
Oh, god I can't
wait to fuck you.

755
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,758
It'll be fun, just
do what he says.

756
00:40:26,792 --> 00:40:28,193
Yeah, come on, just do it.

757
00:40:28,226 --> 00:40:32,898
Listen to your friend, come
on, come on just suck it.

758
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:34,700
Suck it, slut!

759
00:40:34,733 --> 00:40:36,768
Here, allow me.

760
00:40:36,802 --> 00:40:41,239
Aaaahhhh!

761
00:40:42,541 --> 00:40:44,442
Novi, get in the car.

762
00:40:44,476 --> 00:40:47,045
(Novi screaming)

763
00:40:47,078 --> 00:40:48,313
Why did you do that?!

764
00:40:48,346 --> 00:40:49,548
I don't know, they
were fucking rapists,

765
00:40:49,581 --> 00:40:50,649
What the fuck was
I supposed to do?

766
00:40:50,682 --> 00:40:52,017
Could you at least tell me?

767
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,919
It was kind of a
last-minute decision, Novella!

768
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,687
Candice, we're
gonna get arrested!

769
00:40:55,721 --> 00:40:58,557
We're not gonna get
arrested, we're gonna go home!

770
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:01,159
(Screaming)

771
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:03,461
Oh my god!

772
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:06,898
(Tires squealing)

773
00:41:06,932 --> 00:41:10,368
(Men moaning and screaming)

774
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:16,608
(Faint police sirens)

775
00:41:32,758 --> 00:41:35,727
I still feel kinda woozy.

776
00:41:35,761 --> 00:41:37,729
Is it okay if I crash
in your bed tonight?

777
00:41:37,763 --> 00:41:39,998
You're supposed to, remember?

778
00:41:40,031 --> 00:41:41,567
Are you okay?

779
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,268
You look kinda sick.

780
00:41:43,301 --> 00:41:45,270
What the fuck was that?

781
00:41:45,303 --> 00:41:48,406
You know that I carry a gun.

782
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:50,108
Yeah but you never use it.

783
00:41:50,141 --> 00:41:54,613
Well I do when two assholes
are about to rape us!

784
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,648
You know what?

785
00:41:56,682 --> 00:41:58,950
I really don't feel great.

786
00:41:58,984 --> 00:42:01,086
I'm just...

787
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,989
I'm gonna go lay down.

788
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:05,624
You're welcome?

789
00:42:05,657 --> 00:42:07,092
By the way.

790
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:09,027
Yeah, thanks.

791
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,162
Oh, ow.

792
00:42:12,964 --> 00:42:14,633
Ow.

793
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,502
Ow.

794
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:22,240
Candice!

795
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:24,175
Ow.

796
00:42:29,447 --> 00:42:33,919
Candice, I need your help.

797
00:42:33,952 --> 00:42:35,520
What's wrong?

798
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,723
I feel like I'm starving.

799
00:42:37,756 --> 00:42:40,759
Well go get something to eat.

800
00:42:40,792 --> 00:42:42,694
No, I think it's
worse than that.

801
00:42:42,728 --> 00:42:46,064
I need you to take
me to the hospital.

802
00:42:46,097 --> 00:42:49,234
Ugh, we'll go first
thing in the morning

803
00:42:49,267 --> 00:42:52,804
And we'll get burgers and stuff.

804
00:42:52,838 --> 00:42:55,641
No...

805
00:42:55,674 --> 00:42:58,977
Candice, wake up.

806
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:00,245
God dammit!

807
00:43:00,278 --> 00:43:02,480
Wake up.

808
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:09,755
(Novi sobbing and
breathing raggedly)

809
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:17,729
Ow, ow!

810
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,198
Ow!

811
00:43:20,866 --> 00:43:22,901
Ow!

812
00:43:23,702 --> 00:43:28,707
(Novi moaning and screaming)

813
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:36,848
(Shrill static)

814
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:02,894
Novi, be back at seven,
hope you're feeling better,

815
00:46:02,928 --> 00:46:05,396
Good luck at your audition.

816
00:46:06,031 --> 00:46:07,365
Audition?

817
00:46:07,398 --> 00:46:09,634
Fuck!

818
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:23,614
(Ragged breathing)

819
00:46:34,525 --> 00:46:37,028
Novella?

820
00:46:55,246 --> 00:46:58,216
We, have been looking
forward to meeting you.

821
00:46:58,249 --> 00:47:00,385
Thanks, I've been looking
forward to this as well.

822
00:47:00,418 --> 00:47:02,387
Uh, I hope you don't
mind my asking, but uh,

823
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:04,189
What happened to your hand?

824
00:47:04,222 --> 00:47:07,392
Oh, I was in a car
accident a few days ago.

825
00:47:07,425 --> 00:47:08,860
Jeez, is everything okay?

826
00:47:08,894 --> 00:47:11,096
Yeah, I just hurt
my arm and my foot.

827
00:47:11,129 --> 00:47:13,764
It's no big deal.

828
00:47:13,798 --> 00:47:15,400
Did it hurt your eyes?

829
00:47:15,433 --> 00:47:18,536
Oh, sorry.

830
00:47:19,104 --> 00:47:20,906
So, I explained a
little bit about this

831
00:47:20,939 --> 00:47:22,540
In the email, but
we're still looking

832
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:25,243
For our lead actress and we
think you have the perfect look.

833
00:47:25,276 --> 00:47:26,344
Awesome.

834
00:47:26,377 --> 00:47:28,046
You did get the email, right?

835
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:29,547
Sorry, I haven't read it yet.

836
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,016
Oh, that's okay, it had
a couple sides in there

837
00:47:31,049 --> 00:47:33,151
For you to read, but you have
something prepared, right?

838
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:35,186
Yeah, I have a
monologue I did for a play

839
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:36,321
A few years back.

840
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:39,857
Sounds awesome.

841
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:44,896
(Novi sighs)

842
00:47:50,135 --> 00:47:53,871
They look at me
as if I'm not there.

843
00:47:53,905 --> 00:47:58,309
They listen to me
as if I don't speak.

844
00:47:58,343 --> 00:48:00,946
As I walk through the
darkness of my life,

845
00:48:00,979 --> 00:48:03,949
All I can hope for
is to find the light.

846
00:48:03,982 --> 00:48:07,418
No one knows who I
am, or what I can be.

847
00:48:07,452 --> 00:48:12,457
What I can become, only I do.

848
00:48:12,823 --> 00:48:14,960
And I fight, and
I climb, and I try

849
00:48:14,993 --> 00:48:17,262
With every ounce of
strength in my body

850
00:48:17,295 --> 00:48:19,931
To break down these walls.

851
00:48:19,965 --> 00:48:22,167
But it's never enough.

852
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:25,470
My heart hammers at my chest,

853
00:48:25,503 --> 00:48:30,508
Begging to escape,
pounding so hard it hurts.

854
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:37,015
It hurts unlike any pain
I've ever felt before.

855
00:48:37,582 --> 00:48:41,953
And I have felt a lot.

856
00:48:43,154 --> 00:48:46,457
One day I will show
the world who I am,

857
00:48:46,491 --> 00:48:50,996
Not the person they see,
but the person I am.

858
00:48:51,963 --> 00:48:55,100
I will find the light.

859
00:48:56,234 --> 00:48:59,170
They will see me.

860
00:48:59,204 --> 00:49:01,739
They will hear me.

861
00:49:05,376 --> 00:49:08,479
They will see me.

862
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:16,988
(Laughing)

863
00:49:19,424 --> 00:49:21,592
That was amazing,
seriously, did Steve

864
00:49:21,626 --> 00:49:22,994
Put you up to this?

865
00:49:23,028 --> 00:49:24,429
Who's Steve?

866
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:28,266
Oh, Novella honey, you
didn't get the email, did you?

867
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:29,734
No, why?

868
00:49:29,767 --> 00:49:32,937
We're making Anal Alien 7,
not fucking Hamlet, sweetheart.

869
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,039
I was a little excited
there for a second

870
00:49:34,072 --> 00:49:36,774
I was like, monologue
from a play?

871
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:39,444
Fuck yeah, I love porno plays!

872
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:41,246
Yeah, Novella.

873
00:49:41,279 --> 00:49:44,149
Do you do anal?

874
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:49,654
(Sad music)

875
00:52:07,091 --> 00:52:08,058
Hi Novella.

876
00:52:08,092 --> 00:52:10,094
Hey Simon, what are you...

877
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:10,895
Oh my god.

878
00:52:10,928 --> 00:52:12,129
It's okay, come on in.

879
00:52:12,163 --> 00:52:14,031
Jesus, I didn't
even think about this.

880
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:15,900
It'll be alright, I promise.

881
00:52:15,933 --> 00:52:18,769
Step in my office, please.

882
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,206
Fuck.

883
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:25,343
Dr. Simon.

884
00:52:27,578 --> 00:52:30,047
Oh, shit.

885
00:52:30,548 --> 00:52:32,149
Can I get you
something to drink?

886
00:52:32,183 --> 00:52:33,618
No.

887
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:35,119
Anything that would make
you feel more comfortable?

888
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:38,256
I'm pretty sure nothing can
make this more comfortable.

889
00:52:38,289 --> 00:52:41,526
Fair enough.

890
00:52:44,262 --> 00:52:47,832
Okay, um, where to start?

891
00:52:47,865 --> 00:52:50,568
Simon, seriously,
I wasn't too thrilled

892
00:52:50,601 --> 00:52:52,036
About this whole
thing to begin with,

893
00:52:52,069 --> 00:52:55,139
And I know that I'm required
to talk with a shrink,

894
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:57,808
But this isn't gonna work.

895
00:52:57,842 --> 00:53:00,278
Besides, I've had
the shittiest day...

896
00:53:00,311 --> 00:53:01,111
Okay, I know.

897
00:53:01,145 --> 00:53:03,948
I know.

898
00:53:03,981 --> 00:53:06,351
Look, I take suicide
patients from the hospital

899
00:53:06,384 --> 00:53:09,520
So rarely, but they
offer them to me, okay?

900
00:53:09,554 --> 00:53:11,822
They give me a list of
files, they ask if I want

901
00:53:11,856 --> 00:53:14,325
To take any of them on pro Bono.

902
00:53:14,359 --> 00:53:16,727
And I saw your name on the
list, I thought I could help.

903
00:53:16,761 --> 00:53:19,530
Well this isn't what I had
in mind for a first date.

904
00:53:19,564 --> 00:53:21,632
Me neither.

905
00:53:21,666 --> 00:53:23,568
Look I like you.

906
00:53:23,601 --> 00:53:26,871
I don't even know
you, and I like you.

907
00:53:27,538 --> 00:53:29,474
But when I saw that you
tried to kill yourself...

908
00:53:29,507 --> 00:53:31,909
I didn't try to kill myself.

909
00:53:31,942 --> 00:53:33,611
Right.

910
00:53:33,644 --> 00:53:37,014
Can of peaches try to take
a bite out of your arm?

911
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:40,251
Novella, you're a
beautiful woman, alright?

912
00:53:40,285 --> 00:53:42,587
And I know we've only
talked a few times,

913
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:46,657
But you're an incredible person.

914
00:53:47,292 --> 00:53:51,262
I help people, every day,
people who don't deserve it.

915
00:53:51,296 --> 00:53:53,564
You need help, alright
not because you're crazy

916
00:53:53,598 --> 00:53:56,367
Or suicidal, or
anything like that.

917
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:59,404
I wanted to help you because
you should have never

918
00:53:59,437 --> 00:54:03,073
Felt like you needed
to leave this world.

919
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:07,011
It's better with you in it.

920
00:54:10,515 --> 00:54:12,917
I rent this room
from the facility,

921
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:15,085
It's not even
mine, that diploma,

922
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:17,555
No idea whose that is.

923
00:54:18,022 --> 00:54:20,257
Are you hungry?

924
00:54:20,291 --> 00:54:22,293
Are you serious?

925
00:54:22,327 --> 00:54:23,761
Let's go grab some lunch.

926
00:54:23,794 --> 00:54:25,262
Just don't tell anyone.

927
00:54:25,296 --> 00:54:28,333
You like tacos?

928
00:54:28,366 --> 00:54:30,301
I love tacos.

929
00:54:30,335 --> 00:54:32,403
How much, though?

930
00:54:32,737 --> 00:54:34,872
Go grab some.

931
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:45,015
So where do you live?

932
00:54:45,049 --> 00:54:47,117
I actually have a place
a few miles from here.

933
00:54:47,151 --> 00:54:49,420
It's an apartment attached
to my landlady's house.

934
00:54:49,454 --> 00:54:50,955
Live alone?

935
00:54:50,988 --> 00:54:53,691
Yeah, but my friend Candice
is staying with me right now.

936
00:54:53,724 --> 00:54:55,726
She's my suicide watch dog.

937
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,428
Yeah, your scary
friend from the club.

938
00:54:57,462 --> 00:54:59,096
She's not scary.

939
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:02,066
Are you kidding
me, she's terrifying!

940
00:55:02,099 --> 00:55:05,269
She's got bigger arms
than I do, and I work out.

941
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:07,204
Sometimes.

942
00:55:07,237 --> 00:55:09,407
She's a sweetheart.

943
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,743
Actually, she did shoot
two guys last night.

944
00:55:12,777 --> 00:55:14,879
What?!

945
00:55:14,912 --> 00:55:16,547
So Candice always carries
this gun in her purse,

946
00:55:16,581 --> 00:55:18,082
Just in case.

947
00:55:18,115 --> 00:55:19,650
Do you remember those guys we
were dancing with last night?

948
00:55:19,684 --> 00:55:21,051
Yeah.

949
00:55:21,085 --> 00:55:22,086
Well, they tried to rape
us in the parking lot,

950
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:24,855
So Candice blew off their dicks.

951
00:55:24,889 --> 00:55:27,592
Oh my god!

952
00:55:28,526 --> 00:55:30,194
Oh, that's awful.

953
00:55:30,227 --> 00:55:31,529
But you can't say
anything, right, that whole

954
00:55:31,562 --> 00:55:32,963
Confidentiality thing?

955
00:55:32,997 --> 00:55:33,998
Oh, totally.

956
00:55:34,031 --> 00:55:36,434
Just eating tacos, anyway.

957
00:55:36,467 --> 00:55:38,503
Seriously, that's
fucked up, are you okay?

958
00:55:38,536 --> 00:55:42,573
Yeah, I mean Candice
always has my back.

959
00:55:42,607 --> 00:55:45,576
In fact buddy, better watch out.

960
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:47,978
I got it!

961
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:48,946
I was gonna offer
to talk to her, but

962
00:55:48,979 --> 00:55:50,548
I think I want to avoid her now.

963
00:55:50,581 --> 00:55:53,250
Yeah, that's
probably a good idea.

964
00:55:54,785 --> 00:55:57,021
So, this isn't so bad, right?

965
00:55:57,054 --> 00:55:59,023
Feel like you can talk
to me about things?

966
00:55:59,056 --> 00:56:00,525
It's better than
listening to some douchebag

967
00:56:00,558 --> 00:56:02,827
Talk all night just so I
can score a free drink.

968
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:05,663
I bet.

969
00:56:06,163 --> 00:56:08,699
Wanna tell me what
happened to your arm?

970
00:56:08,733 --> 00:56:10,635
I've just been going
through a lot lately.

971
00:56:10,668 --> 00:56:12,202
Yeah, like what?

972
00:56:12,236 --> 00:56:14,972
I haven't landed a
role in over three years.

973
00:56:15,005 --> 00:56:16,507
How are you able to
pay for everything?

974
00:56:16,541 --> 00:56:18,743
I've had some
inheritance money saved up,

975
00:56:18,776 --> 00:56:21,946
And that well is
pretty much dry now.

976
00:56:21,979 --> 00:56:24,815
So, oh, and I got
in a car accident.

977
00:56:24,849 --> 00:56:26,016
Oh you really did
get in a car wreck?

978
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:28,419
Yeah, that's what
happened to my foot.

979
00:56:28,453 --> 00:56:30,087
And when I got home,
my landlady told me

980
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,022
I was gonna be evicted.

981
00:56:32,056 --> 00:56:37,061
So I don't know I just,
I just snapped, you know?

982
00:56:37,795 --> 00:56:40,865
I just bit my wrist
as hard as I could.

983
00:56:43,701 --> 00:56:45,970
You know, when things
start to pile up,

984
00:56:46,003 --> 00:56:50,040
It's good if you have
something you can count on

985
00:56:50,074 --> 00:56:51,509
To make you happy.

986
00:56:51,542 --> 00:56:54,044
A place you can go, a family
member you can talk to,

987
00:56:54,078 --> 00:56:57,882
Even a television show
you like to watch.

988
00:56:57,915 --> 00:56:59,283
Do you have anything like that?

989
00:56:59,316 --> 00:57:00,518
I don't know.

990
00:57:00,551 --> 00:57:01,318
Come on.

991
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:02,553
How about acting?

992
00:57:02,587 --> 00:57:04,121
You know, a few years
ago I'd have probably

993
00:57:04,154 --> 00:57:06,657
Said yes, but I just...

994
00:57:09,093 --> 00:57:12,129
When I was younger, and
stupid shit would happen

995
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:15,265
It didn't bother me because
I was young and stupid.

996
00:57:15,299 --> 00:57:18,302
But now that I'm older, it's
just not me anymore you know?

997
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:19,504
Times change.

998
00:57:19,537 --> 00:57:21,371
Exactly.

999
00:57:21,405 --> 00:57:23,774
It's just not me.

1000
00:57:23,808 --> 00:57:27,211
Maybe it's time
you start being you.

1001
00:57:27,912 --> 00:57:31,381
I've been thinking that
a lot lately, actually.

1002
00:57:31,682 --> 00:57:35,486
Speaking of which, I like you.

1003
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,955
Isn't that breaking some
sort of rule or something?

1004
00:57:37,988 --> 00:57:38,923
I don't know, probably.

1005
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:40,958
No, definitely.

1006
00:57:40,991 --> 00:57:43,494
It's true though, I like you.

1007
00:57:43,528 --> 00:57:46,363
I talk to people all
day, I don't like them.

1008
00:57:46,396 --> 00:57:48,533
You, I like.

1009
00:57:48,566 --> 00:57:51,168
That's very sweet.

1010
00:57:51,435 --> 00:57:52,903
What are you doing tonight?

1011
00:57:52,937 --> 00:57:53,538
Tonight?

1012
00:57:53,571 --> 00:57:55,005
Mmm-hmm.

1013
00:57:55,039 --> 00:57:56,340
You gonna go to the club,
castrate a few more guys?

1014
00:57:56,373 --> 00:57:58,342
I guess I could always
do that this weekend.

1015
00:57:58,375 --> 00:57:59,710
Great!

1016
00:57:59,744 --> 00:58:01,278
(Novi laughs)

1017
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:03,313
Have dinner with me, then.

1018
00:58:05,616 --> 00:58:09,019
Actually, that sounds great.

1019
00:58:29,874 --> 00:58:30,775
Hey there.

1020
00:58:30,808 --> 00:58:32,109
Jeez!

1021
00:58:32,142 --> 00:58:33,410
You scared me.

1022
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:34,612
Sorry.

1023
00:58:34,645 --> 00:58:36,113
You're home early.

1024
00:58:36,146 --> 00:58:40,384
Yeah, I just, I wanted to
talk to you about last night.

1025
00:58:40,417 --> 00:58:41,886
Are you okay?

1026
00:58:41,919 --> 00:58:43,420
Yeah, it was just
intense, I've never seen

1027
00:58:43,453 --> 00:58:46,190
Anyone shot before, let alone
right in front of my face.

1028
00:58:46,223 --> 00:58:50,060
I was talking about you
being sick last night.

1029
00:58:50,094 --> 00:58:51,996
Fuck those guys.

1030
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:54,198
Me being sick?

1031
00:58:54,231 --> 00:58:55,365
Last night?

1032
00:58:55,399 --> 00:58:57,201
In the bathroom, you were sick?

1033
00:58:57,234 --> 00:58:58,535
And then this morning I
tried to open the door

1034
00:58:58,569 --> 00:59:00,237
And you locked yourself
in there, I mean

1035
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:01,305
Are you okay?

1036
00:59:01,338 --> 00:59:03,007
Yeah it was just the ruffi.

1037
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,609
I'm sorry I didn't
take you to the hospital,

1038
00:59:04,642 --> 00:59:07,578
I just got so fucked up
that I passed out, you know?

1039
00:59:07,612 --> 00:59:08,979
It's cool.

1040
00:59:09,013 --> 00:59:11,415
I mean those guys had
it coming, you know?

1041
00:59:11,448 --> 00:59:13,784
I mean if anybody tries
to fuck with you or me

1042
00:59:13,818 --> 00:59:15,385
Then I'll fuck 'em up.

1043
00:59:15,419 --> 00:59:17,588
Clearly.

1044
00:59:17,622 --> 00:59:20,090
Well yeah, clearly.

1045
00:59:20,124 --> 00:59:22,760
I'm sorry, um, but do
you think that those guys

1046
00:59:22,793 --> 00:59:25,229
Are ever going to fuck
with any girl ever again?

1047
00:59:25,262 --> 00:59:27,998
Candice, I'm more worried
about being a wanted fugitive.

1048
00:59:28,032 --> 00:59:30,367
I would love to hear that.

1049
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:34,304
Um, uh, these girls
tried to rob us, uh,

1050
00:59:34,338 --> 00:59:35,973
In an alley, and we
didn't know what to do,

1051
00:59:36,006 --> 00:59:39,610
So we just ran away with our
tails between our legs, uh...

1052
00:59:39,644 --> 00:59:43,781
Okay, but if we get
busted, you're on your own.

1053
00:59:44,649 --> 00:59:48,352
Novi, can we just forget
about this whole gun thing?

1054
00:59:48,385 --> 00:59:51,656
It's not that big of a deal!

1055
01:00:08,973 --> 01:00:10,440
Jesus.

1056
01:00:10,474 --> 01:00:11,742
What happened to your foot?

1057
01:00:11,776 --> 01:00:13,410
From the car accident.

1058
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:14,779
You didn't tell me about that.

1059
01:00:14,812 --> 01:00:16,013
I didn't?

1060
01:00:16,046 --> 01:00:17,882
No, you didn't tell
me about your foot.

1061
01:00:17,915 --> 01:00:19,316
Don't you think you
should see a doctor?

1062
01:00:19,349 --> 01:00:22,019
Candice, do you not understand
the concept of being broke?

1063
01:00:22,052 --> 01:00:24,121
I have enough medical
bills to pay for.

1064
01:00:24,154 --> 01:00:27,257
I don't know, Novi, your
foot looks kinda gangrene.

1065
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:29,359
I'll clean it later.

1066
01:00:29,393 --> 01:00:30,761
Eww.

1067
01:00:30,795 --> 01:00:33,330
Gross.

1068
01:00:33,363 --> 01:00:34,732
Are you going on a date?

1069
01:00:34,765 --> 01:00:35,532
Yep.

1070
01:00:35,565 --> 01:00:36,433
No shit, with who?

1071
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:37,902
Dr. Simon.

1072
01:00:37,935 --> 01:00:39,770
Who the fuck is Dr. Simon?

1073
01:00:39,804 --> 01:00:41,872
The guy from the
club the other night.

1074
01:00:41,906 --> 01:00:42,773
Hmm.

1075
01:00:42,807 --> 01:00:44,975
I don't remember him.

1076
01:00:45,009 --> 01:00:46,543
And if you're going on
a date, you should not

1077
01:00:46,576 --> 01:00:49,546
Wear that dress, it makes your
sides flip out like a muffin.

1078
01:00:51,281 --> 01:00:52,983
Well get this.

1079
01:00:53,017 --> 01:00:55,085
He's actually my doctor.

1080
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:56,687
Your doctor.

1081
01:00:56,721 --> 01:00:58,588
You hate doctors.

1082
01:00:58,622 --> 01:01:01,291
Not my doctor
doctor, my shrink.

1083
01:01:01,325 --> 01:01:02,626
Huh.

1084
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:03,994
Is that like illegal
or something?

1085
01:01:04,028 --> 01:01:05,963
I don't care.

1086
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:08,232
I didn't want to do that
therapy shit anyway.

1087
01:01:08,265 --> 01:01:10,735
And he's sweet, he cares
about me, and I like

1088
01:01:10,768 --> 01:01:13,738
Talking to him.

1089
01:01:13,771 --> 01:01:15,605
I like that dress.

1090
01:01:15,639 --> 01:01:17,341
You look really
hot in that dress.

1091
01:01:17,374 --> 01:01:19,143
It's not weird, really.

1092
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:22,379
And, he thinks I should
quit acting, too.

1093
01:01:22,412 --> 01:01:23,613
What?!

1094
01:01:23,647 --> 01:01:24,815
Yeah.

1095
01:01:24,849 --> 01:01:27,217
He agrees with me, it's
just not me anymore.

1096
01:01:27,251 --> 01:01:32,356
So, are you just gonna
do whatever Simon says?

1097
01:01:32,389 --> 01:01:34,191
I'm sorry, that's just
really bold of him to say

1098
01:01:34,224 --> 01:01:36,927
Considering that he
barely even knows you.

1099
01:01:36,961 --> 01:01:41,799
Well, maybe you
don't really know me.

1100
01:01:44,068 --> 01:01:45,702
What the fuck is
that supposed to mean?

1101
01:01:45,736 --> 01:01:46,937
Candice, I've been going
through a lot lately,

1102
01:01:46,971 --> 01:01:50,107
And you don't really
seem to support me.

1103
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:51,508
Are you fucking kidding me?

1104
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,077
No, I'm not!

1105
01:01:53,110 --> 01:01:55,379
Fucking amazing!

1106
01:01:55,412 --> 01:01:57,547
I mean, really!

1107
01:01:57,581 --> 01:01:58,916
You know what?

1108
01:01:58,949 --> 01:02:01,318
Let me compose a list for you.

1109
01:02:01,351 --> 01:02:04,488
When you tried to kill yourself,
who was there for you, me.

1110
01:02:04,521 --> 01:02:06,957
And when you needed
someone to stay with you

1111
01:02:06,991 --> 01:02:09,827
Every night this week,
who was there for you, me.

1112
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:12,562
And when two fucking
assholes tried to rape you

1113
01:02:12,596 --> 01:02:15,265
In a back alley, who
was there for you, me!

1114
01:02:15,299 --> 01:02:17,667
I know, Jesus, Candice!

1115
01:02:17,701 --> 01:02:19,369
I've just gone through a
lot lately and I really

1116
01:02:19,403 --> 01:02:22,572
Need you to support
me and you're not!

1117
01:02:22,606 --> 01:02:24,474
I just need some space!

1118
01:02:24,508 --> 01:02:26,076
Gimme some fucking room
to breathe, you're always

1119
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:29,513
Fucking smothering me!

1120
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,349
You know what?

1121
01:02:32,382 --> 01:02:35,185
You can have your fucking space.

1122
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:37,822
Unbelievable.

1123
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:42,759
God dammit!

1124
01:02:47,697 --> 01:02:52,702
(Ominous background noise)

1125
01:03:59,303 --> 01:04:01,738
I'm sorry, I have
absolutely zero manners.

1126
01:04:01,771 --> 01:04:03,307
It's fine, really.

1127
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:05,409
I prefer it to
the salad-pickers.

1128
01:04:05,442 --> 01:04:08,712
Yeah, I've always been an
eater, the more meat the better.

1129
01:04:08,745 --> 01:04:11,648
Mmm, you from Texas?

1130
01:04:11,916 --> 01:04:13,050
Bakersfield.

1131
01:04:13,083 --> 01:04:14,384
I am so sorry.

1132
01:04:14,418 --> 01:04:15,319
I know, right?

1133
01:04:15,352 --> 01:04:16,653
How could you have ever left?

1134
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:17,587
Tell me about it.

1135
01:04:17,621 --> 01:04:19,123
It wasn't too bad though.

1136
01:04:19,156 --> 01:04:20,157
It was just boring.

1137
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:21,591
So, where's your family?

1138
01:04:21,625 --> 01:04:23,727
Well, my mom left
when I was really young.

1139
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:24,962
Mmm-hmm.

1140
01:04:24,995 --> 01:04:26,363
And my dad died a
few years after that.

1141
01:04:26,396 --> 01:04:28,298
He was getting a minor
operation and the doctors

1142
01:04:28,332 --> 01:04:30,667
Screwed up and killed him.

1143
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,903
I'm sorry.

1144
01:04:32,937 --> 01:04:34,804
Yeah.

1145
01:04:34,838 --> 01:04:36,840
Is that where you
got your inheritance?

1146
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:39,944
It was a cash
settlement, actually.

1147
01:04:39,977 --> 01:04:42,612
It's lasted me all these
years, but, you know

1148
01:04:42,646 --> 01:04:45,349
I'd give it all away just
so I could have him back.

1149
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:46,583
Absolutely.

1150
01:04:46,616 --> 01:04:49,086
After that, I lived
with my aunt and uncle,

1151
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:50,955
It was pretty awful.

1152
01:04:50,988 --> 01:04:52,056
What?

1153
01:04:52,089 --> 01:04:53,357
You know, the usual stuff.

1154
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:54,925
An abusive uncle.

1155
01:04:54,959 --> 01:04:56,660
Something that will give
us plenty to talk about

1156
01:04:56,693 --> 01:04:58,128
In a session someday.

1157
01:04:58,162 --> 01:05:01,098
Good, I'll look
forward to it then.

1158
01:05:01,131 --> 01:05:02,466
So what'd you do today?

1159
01:05:02,499 --> 01:05:05,435
Mmm, I had another
patient for an hour

1160
01:05:05,469 --> 01:05:07,337
And then I went home.

1161
01:05:07,371 --> 01:05:08,772
You?

1162
01:05:08,805 --> 01:05:11,741
I went home, I actually
got in a fight with Candice.

1163
01:05:11,775 --> 01:05:13,243
About what?

1164
01:05:13,277 --> 01:05:16,346
I don't know, she
can kinda be annoying.

1165
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:17,881
How long you two been friends?

1166
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:19,383
Since that creepy uncle.

1167
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:21,351
She helped me run away from him.

1168
01:05:21,385 --> 01:05:23,153
Sounds like she's
a real friend.

1169
01:05:23,187 --> 01:05:24,888
Yeah.

1170
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:26,523
She's pretty badass.

1171
01:05:26,556 --> 01:05:29,293
She always has my back.

1172
01:05:32,296 --> 01:05:35,099
How do you feel about dessert?

1173
01:05:35,132 --> 01:05:39,036
Just, scale of one to 10.

1174
01:05:39,069 --> 01:05:40,070
I'd love to.

1175
01:05:40,104 --> 01:05:41,238
Yeah?

1176
01:05:41,271 --> 01:05:42,439
It's actually, it's not here.

1177
01:05:42,472 --> 01:05:45,242
I'm sure it's wonderful here.

1178
01:05:45,275 --> 01:05:47,144
Do you trust me?

1179
01:05:47,177 --> 01:05:48,245
What is it?

1180
01:05:48,278 --> 01:05:49,879
Life-changing is what it is.

1181
01:05:49,913 --> 01:05:52,282
(Novi laughs)

1182
01:05:53,617 --> 01:05:54,985
Sure.

1183
01:05:57,554 --> 01:05:58,822
Viola!

1184
01:05:58,855 --> 01:06:00,257
Oh my god.

1185
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:02,326
I told you, they're
worth waiting for.

1186
01:06:02,692 --> 01:06:03,893
Will I appreciate
these even though

1187
01:06:03,927 --> 01:06:05,762
I'm kind of drunk?

1188
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:10,800
Novella, darling, the dead
can appreciate these cookies.

1189
01:06:12,136 --> 01:06:13,703
Here.

1190
01:06:13,737 --> 01:06:15,305
Woo!

1191
01:06:15,339 --> 01:06:16,540
Still a little hot, careful.

1192
01:06:16,573 --> 01:06:18,775
Thank you.

1193
01:06:19,609 --> 01:06:21,578
Hold on!

1194
01:06:25,615 --> 01:06:27,451
Together.

1195
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:28,952
Mmm!

1196
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:32,156
Mmm.

1197
01:06:33,957 --> 01:06:36,093
Mmm.

1198
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:50,807
(Wistful music)

1199
01:07:49,399 --> 01:07:51,235
Oh my god.

1200
01:07:51,268 --> 01:07:53,370
What?

1201
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:57,207
(Shrill static)

1202
01:08:17,661 --> 01:08:20,730
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1203
01:08:22,166 --> 01:08:24,401
You okay?

1204
01:08:25,769 --> 01:08:28,772
Yeah, I just had a bad dream.

1205
01:08:29,773 --> 01:08:32,442
Good.

1206
01:08:32,476 --> 01:08:35,312
We can talk about it
in our session today.

1207
01:08:36,012 --> 01:08:38,848
You still want me to come in?

1208
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:42,652
Sure, why not?

1209
01:08:45,054 --> 01:08:46,256
I have a few appointments
in the morning,

1210
01:08:46,290 --> 01:08:49,293
But then maybe we can
spend the day together.

1211
01:08:49,626 --> 01:08:52,996
Okay, sounds great.

1212
01:09:16,186 --> 01:09:19,323
Novi, baby, how are you?

1213
01:09:19,356 --> 01:09:21,024
Hey Eesha, how are you?

1214
01:09:21,057 --> 01:09:23,092
Oh, I'm fine.

1215
01:09:23,126 --> 01:09:25,128
Did you have a long night?

1216
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:27,331
I did.

1217
01:09:27,364 --> 01:09:28,898
Were you with a boy?

1218
01:09:28,932 --> 01:09:31,067
I was, I was indeed.

1219
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:32,336
Is he handsome?

1220
01:09:32,369 --> 01:09:33,803
Oh, very.

1221
01:09:33,837 --> 01:09:35,439
So, what does he do?

1222
01:09:35,472 --> 01:09:36,506
He's a psychiatrist.

1223
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:37,774
A doctor!

1224
01:09:37,807 --> 01:09:41,578
Oh my Novi, I am
so happy for you.

1225
01:09:41,611 --> 01:09:43,179
Thanks, I really like him.

1226
01:09:43,213 --> 01:09:45,649
I bet you are, and it's
about time that we had

1227
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:48,252
Some little grandbabies
running around here.

1228
01:09:48,285 --> 01:09:50,420
I think so, too.

1229
01:09:50,454 --> 01:09:52,055
Have you ever
decorated a baby?

1230
01:09:52,088 --> 01:09:54,324
It's so much fun.

1231
01:09:54,558 --> 01:09:56,426
What's wrong with
you, you little shit?

1232
01:09:56,460 --> 01:10:01,030
He gets really jealous when
I talk about grandchildren.

1233
01:10:01,064 --> 01:10:02,432
I bet he does.

1234
01:10:02,466 --> 01:10:05,535
Well, I need to go but,
if boyfriend comes over,

1235
01:10:05,569 --> 01:10:07,804
Be sure to introduce him to me.

1236
01:10:07,837 --> 01:10:09,873
I must approve.

1237
01:10:09,906 --> 01:10:11,941
I will.

1238
01:10:11,975 --> 01:10:13,310
Bye, Eesha.

1239
01:10:13,343 --> 01:10:15,279
Bye, Novi.

1240
01:10:17,146 --> 01:10:19,616
Come on, come on.

1241
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:27,424
Well well, look who's
doing the walk of shame.

1242
01:10:27,457 --> 01:10:32,228
Hey, don't hate
the playa baby.

1243
01:10:32,262 --> 01:10:33,663
I came home last
night and you were gone

1244
01:10:33,697 --> 01:10:35,699
And I got kind of worried.

1245
01:10:35,732 --> 01:10:36,800
Seriously?

1246
01:10:36,833 --> 01:10:38,234
Yeah.

1247
01:10:38,268 --> 01:10:39,403
You made me realize that
sometimes I can just kind of

1248
01:10:39,436 --> 01:10:41,405
Freak out about stuff, you know?

1249
01:10:41,438 --> 01:10:43,840
Uh, yeah, I know.

1250
01:10:43,873 --> 01:10:46,876
I don't know, I just...

1251
01:10:47,344 --> 01:10:50,246
I don't know, sometimes
I just feel like I...

1252
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:52,382
You know what, I don't know.

1253
01:10:55,184 --> 01:10:57,921
I know.

1254
01:10:59,188 --> 01:11:02,158
I'll try to lay off.

1255
01:11:02,191 --> 01:11:03,627
Thanks.

1256
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:05,662
Do you like him?

1257
01:11:05,695 --> 01:11:08,365
He's amazing.

1258
01:11:08,398 --> 01:11:10,233
And he bakes cookies.

1259
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:11,801
Really?

1260
01:11:11,835 --> 01:11:13,202
Are they any good?

1261
01:11:13,236 --> 01:11:16,373
Life-changing.

1262
01:11:17,441 --> 01:11:21,745
Well, if you like
him then I like him.

1263
01:11:24,514 --> 01:11:26,282
So I was talking to Sara
at the shop the other day.

1264
01:11:26,316 --> 01:11:28,385
And I told her that
you like to do my hair,

1265
01:11:28,418 --> 01:11:29,686
You know what she said?

1266
01:11:29,719 --> 01:11:31,154
What?

1267
01:11:31,187 --> 01:11:32,322
That you can come by the
shop whenever you want to

1268
01:11:32,356 --> 01:11:33,189
And take a look around.

1269
01:11:33,222 --> 01:11:33,990
Are you serious?

1270
01:11:34,023 --> 01:11:35,425
Yeah, totally serious.

1271
01:11:35,459 --> 01:11:37,727
Thank you so much.

1272
01:11:38,362 --> 01:11:39,596
What are you doing home?

1273
01:11:39,629 --> 01:11:40,964
I have off work.

1274
01:11:40,997 --> 01:11:43,299
I thought I'd go on
a hike or go shopping

1275
01:11:43,333 --> 01:11:46,035
Or some shit like
that in a little bit.

1276
01:11:46,736 --> 01:11:49,138
Do you wanna go?

1277
01:11:49,172 --> 01:11:53,076
Well I do, but Simon and I
are gonna go grab some lunch.

1278
01:11:53,109 --> 01:11:54,678
Right.

1279
01:11:54,711 --> 01:11:55,845
You guys are totally
still in your

1280
01:11:55,879 --> 01:11:57,414
Honeymoon phase, aren't you?

1281
01:11:57,447 --> 01:11:59,849
Yeah, I guess we are.

1282
01:12:01,217 --> 01:12:03,353
I'm happy for you.

1283
01:12:03,387 --> 01:12:05,955
Thanks, I am happy.

1284
01:12:05,989 --> 01:12:06,990
But seriously, if
he breaks your heart

1285
01:12:07,023 --> 01:12:08,558
I'll fucking kill him.

1286
01:12:08,592 --> 01:12:09,393
(Novi laughs)

1287
01:12:09,426 --> 01:12:10,394
I will!

1288
01:12:10,427 --> 01:12:13,062
I'm serious!

1289
01:12:13,096 --> 01:12:16,265
I know you would.

1290
01:12:32,482 --> 01:12:35,619
Are you following me?

1291
01:12:37,286 --> 01:12:39,122
What the hell
are you doing here?

1292
01:12:39,155 --> 01:12:41,124
I'm meeting someone.

1293
01:12:41,157 --> 01:12:42,091
Who?

1294
01:12:42,125 --> 01:12:43,660
Simon?

1295
01:12:43,693 --> 01:12:45,028
Yeah.

1296
01:12:45,061 --> 01:12:46,530
Like, for an appointment?

1297
01:12:46,563 --> 01:12:47,597
Sort of.

1298
01:12:47,631 --> 01:12:50,700
We're kind of seeing each other.

1299
01:12:51,234 --> 01:12:52,168
(Tracy laughs)

1300
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:53,703
Why are you laughing?

1301
01:12:53,737 --> 01:12:55,371
You're kidding me, right?

1302
01:12:55,405 --> 01:12:57,273
No, I'm not.

1303
01:12:57,306 --> 01:12:58,842
Then what are you doing here?

1304
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:01,478
I have an appointment
in an hour, and I had

1305
01:13:01,511 --> 01:13:05,014
Nothing else to do so I
thought I'd come here early.

1306
01:13:05,849 --> 01:13:07,951
Did you try to kill yourself?

1307
01:13:07,984 --> 01:13:09,819
No, I didn't.

1308
01:13:09,853 --> 01:13:11,287
Why would you do that?

1309
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:12,121
I didn't!

1310
01:13:12,155 --> 01:13:13,156
Yes, you did.

1311
01:13:13,189 --> 01:13:14,323
Why?

1312
01:13:14,357 --> 01:13:15,525
Tracy, I didn't
try to kill myself,

1313
01:13:15,559 --> 01:13:16,860
Why do you think I
tried to kill myself?

1314
01:13:16,893 --> 01:13:18,962
Because I...

1315
01:13:20,764 --> 01:13:23,199
I tried to kill myself.

1316
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:24,801
Last year.

1317
01:13:24,834 --> 01:13:27,370
That's when I
started seeing Simon.

1318
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:29,906
Why would you try
to kill yourself?

1319
01:13:29,939 --> 01:13:31,541
I asked you first.

1320
01:13:31,575 --> 01:13:33,409
Because my life sucks.

1321
01:13:33,443 --> 01:13:34,911
So does mine.

1322
01:13:34,944 --> 01:13:36,646
Your life is amazing.

1323
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:39,048
You get all the roles,
and you're beautiful.

1324
01:13:39,082 --> 01:13:41,951
God, I wish I had half as
much success as you do.

1325
01:13:41,985 --> 01:13:44,454
And you're 10 years
younger than me.

1326
01:13:44,488 --> 01:13:48,191
I haven't gotten a
part since I moved here.

1327
01:13:48,224 --> 01:13:49,593
What are you talking about?

1328
01:13:49,626 --> 01:13:51,160
I haven't.

1329
01:13:51,194 --> 01:13:54,397
I just say I do.

1330
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:55,965
It makes me feel better.

1331
01:13:55,999 --> 01:13:57,901
So then why do all the
casting directors and producers

1332
01:13:57,934 --> 01:14:02,071
Request you, why do
you have an agent?

1333
01:14:02,105 --> 01:14:04,774
Because.

1334
01:14:06,510 --> 01:14:10,213
I do everything you say I do.

1335
01:14:10,246 --> 01:14:11,515
What?

1336
01:14:11,548 --> 01:14:15,251
I uh, I sleep with them.

1337
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:20,289
And they always say
they'll give me the part,

1338
01:14:20,490 --> 01:14:23,392
And they never do.

1339
01:14:23,426 --> 01:14:25,595
They just use me.

1340
01:14:25,629 --> 01:14:27,831
Ugh, I'm disgusting.

1341
01:14:28,231 --> 01:14:29,465
No you're not, don't say that.

1342
01:14:29,499 --> 01:14:34,103
Yes, I am, I disgust myself.

1343
01:14:34,137 --> 01:14:37,874
And that's probably why I try
to cut you down all the time,

1344
01:14:37,907 --> 01:14:41,778
Because you're so much
stronger than I am.

1345
01:14:42,211 --> 01:14:43,813
No I'm not, trust me.

1346
01:14:43,847 --> 01:14:46,516
Yes, you are.

1347
01:14:46,550 --> 01:14:49,385
But I never would
have thought you would

1348
01:14:49,418 --> 01:14:51,120
Give in to Simon.

1349
01:14:51,154 --> 01:14:53,022
What do you mean?

1350
01:14:53,056 --> 01:14:55,592
His game.

1351
01:14:55,625 --> 01:14:57,661
What are you talking about?

1352
01:14:57,694 --> 01:15:00,530
Oh no, oh no.

1353
01:15:00,564 --> 01:15:01,598
- What...
- I'm sorry.

1354
01:15:01,631 --> 01:15:02,465
What are you talking about?

1355
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:03,232
Nothing.

1356
01:15:03,266 --> 01:15:04,167
Tracy, tell me!

1357
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:06,069
Simon does this all the time.

1358
01:15:06,102 --> 01:15:07,637
Does what?

1359
01:15:07,671 --> 01:15:10,039
Okay, he calls the
hospital, he asks for

1360
01:15:10,073 --> 01:15:11,841
Suicidal girls.

1361
01:15:11,875 --> 01:15:13,777
Then he pretends
he's Prince Charming,

1362
01:15:13,810 --> 01:15:15,745
And he sleeps with them.

1363
01:15:15,779 --> 01:15:18,181
I heard him telling
his friends about it.

1364
01:15:18,214 --> 01:15:20,483
No, that's not true.

1365
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:21,785
Simon and I knew
each other way before

1366
01:15:21,818 --> 01:15:23,486
I ever started coming here.

1367
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:25,454
Then that's probably
why he picked you.

1368
01:15:25,488 --> 01:15:27,624
No Tracy, he didn't pick me.

1369
01:15:27,657 --> 01:15:29,058
This is different!

1370
01:15:29,092 --> 01:15:31,494
Novella, I'm not
trying to be mean.

1371
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:32,696
I'm sorry.

1372
01:15:32,729 --> 01:15:34,163
Then why do you
keep coming here?

1373
01:15:34,197 --> 01:15:37,533
Because, he
makes me feel good.

1374
01:15:37,567 --> 01:15:40,804
All the other guys
don't even talk to me.

1375
01:15:40,837 --> 01:15:43,506
At least he pretends I'm
there when we're having sex.

1376
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:44,808
Oh my god.

1377
01:15:44,841 --> 01:15:45,842
This isn't happening.

1378
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:47,043
Novella, I'm so sorry.

1379
01:15:47,076 --> 01:15:48,978
Shut up, Tracy!

1380
01:15:49,012 --> 01:15:50,179
If it makes you feel...

1381
01:15:50,213 --> 01:15:51,314
Shut the fuck up
you fucking slut!

1382
01:15:51,347 --> 01:15:53,449
You're fucking lying to me!

1383
01:15:53,482 --> 01:15:55,451
Fuck you!

1384
01:15:56,586 --> 01:15:58,655
What the hell is going on?

1385
01:15:58,688 --> 01:16:01,157
Why are you crying?

1386
01:16:01,457 --> 01:16:05,762
(Ominous background music)

1387
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:11,701
(Novella screams and sobs)

1388
01:16:28,517 --> 01:16:31,788
(Retching)

1389
01:16:59,949 --> 01:17:02,185
What the fuck is
wrong with you?!

1390
01:17:02,218 --> 01:17:05,521
(Indistinct yelling)

1391
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:47,396
Is this a dream?

1392
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:55,104
This is a dream.

1393
01:18:00,744 --> 01:18:03,246
What the fuck did you do to me?

1394
01:18:03,279 --> 01:18:06,315
What the fuck did you do to me?!

1395
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:09,052
What did I do to you?

1396
01:18:09,085 --> 01:18:10,419
Are you kidding me?

1397
01:18:10,453 --> 01:18:11,287
Let me go!

1398
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:12,621
Let me go now!

1399
01:18:12,655 --> 01:18:15,725
Novi, just stop,
okay, just stop.

1400
01:18:15,759 --> 01:18:16,926
No you just stop!

1401
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:18,127
You're not my fucking
mother, you're not

1402
01:18:18,161 --> 01:18:20,864
My fucking sister,
you're fucking nobody!

1403
01:18:20,897 --> 01:18:22,031
Why don't you just
go cut someone's hair

1404
01:18:22,065 --> 01:18:26,803
Or fucking shoot
someone, you psycho!

1405
01:18:27,670 --> 01:18:30,539
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

1406
01:18:31,775 --> 01:18:35,211
(Novi sobs)

1407
01:18:35,244 --> 01:18:38,147
Shhh, shhh it's okay.

1408
01:18:38,748 --> 01:18:41,050
It's okay.

1409
01:18:41,084 --> 01:18:42,418
Candice.

1410
01:18:46,022 --> 01:18:48,892
I'm so fucked up.

1411
01:18:52,361 --> 01:18:55,999
Candice, I'm a fucking lunatic.

1412
01:18:56,432 --> 01:19:00,003
I can't live like this
anymore, I just can't.

1413
01:19:00,036 --> 01:19:03,172
Why did you do
this to yourself?

1414
01:19:07,176 --> 01:19:10,313
Dr. Simon.

1415
01:19:10,546 --> 01:19:12,916
What happened?

1416
01:19:13,682 --> 01:19:17,186
He used me, just like
everyone else does.

1417
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:19,255
What do you mean?

1418
01:19:19,288 --> 01:19:20,523
He fucked me because
that's what he does

1419
01:19:20,556 --> 01:19:22,291
With every girl he meets.

1420
01:19:22,325 --> 01:19:24,193
Just like every
director or producer,

1421
01:19:24,227 --> 01:19:28,431
Or any guy with a fucking
dick between his legs!

1422
01:19:29,866 --> 01:19:31,067
Novi?

1423
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:32,635
I'll be right back, okay?

1424
01:19:32,668 --> 01:19:35,404
No, Candice don't leave
me, I'm gonna fucking

1425
01:19:35,438 --> 01:19:37,206
Bleed to death.

1426
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:39,508
Just, here.

1427
01:19:39,542 --> 01:19:41,911
If you need to call someone
or anything, the phone's

1428
01:19:41,945 --> 01:19:44,948
Right there okay,
I'll be right back.

1429
01:19:44,981 --> 01:19:46,182
Candice!

1430
01:19:46,215 --> 01:19:47,851
No, don't leave me!

1431
01:19:47,884 --> 01:19:49,953
Novi, I'm gonna take
care of everything, okay?

1432
01:19:49,986 --> 01:19:51,855
Don't worry,
everything will be...

1433
01:19:51,888 --> 01:19:52,956
It'll be fine.

1434
01:19:52,989 --> 01:19:54,690
Okay?

1435
01:19:54,891 --> 01:19:58,928
Candice, no!

1436
01:20:05,534 --> 01:20:09,873
(Phone vibrating)

1437
01:20:17,546 --> 01:20:19,215
Hello?

1438
01:20:19,248 --> 01:20:21,384
Novella?

1439
01:20:22,185 --> 01:20:24,253
Novella?

1440
01:20:24,587 --> 01:20:25,922
Hello?

1441
01:20:25,955 --> 01:20:27,756
Novella?

1442
01:20:27,790 --> 01:20:30,559
Simon, I need your help.

1443
01:20:32,561 --> 01:20:35,131
What happened
today, where were you?

1444
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:39,035
I know everything.

1445
01:20:39,068 --> 01:20:40,937
You're using me.

1446
01:20:40,970 --> 01:20:44,440
What?

1447
01:20:44,473 --> 01:20:46,442
I know you were just
using me to fuck me.

1448
01:20:46,475 --> 01:20:47,843
I know you don't
even care about me,

1449
01:20:47,877 --> 01:20:50,213
You probably don't even like me.

1450
01:20:50,246 --> 01:20:52,848
Tracy told me everything.

1451
01:20:52,882 --> 01:20:55,084
Oh god, Novella, listen.

1452
01:20:55,118 --> 01:20:57,987
Tracy has been a patient
of mine for two years.

1453
01:20:58,021 --> 01:20:59,956
She's a pathological liar.

1454
01:20:59,989 --> 01:21:02,391
No, I'm done with
your bullshit, Simon.

1455
01:21:02,425 --> 01:21:05,394
Novella, just listen!

1456
01:21:05,428 --> 01:21:07,863
She tells her friends that
she's this popular actress,

1457
01:21:07,897 --> 01:21:11,234
She tells people she
tried to kill herself.

1458
01:21:11,267 --> 01:21:14,037
She also tells people that
we've been involved, sexually.

1459
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:16,205
It's all lies.

1460
01:21:16,239 --> 01:21:18,874
I'll show you my client
