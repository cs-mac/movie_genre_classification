1
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:21,851
Cherry Blossoms

2
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:00,516
I always wanted to
go to Japan with him.

3
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:04,495
Just to see Mt. Fuji once.
The cherry blossoms. With him.

4
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:09,265
Because seeing anything without
my husband, I can't even imagine that.

5
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:12,236
That would be like not really seeing it.

6
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:14,569
How can I go on living without him?

7
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:23,844
We wanted to talk it over
with you first.

8
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:27,852
If you think your husband
can cope with the diagnosis...

9
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:30,855
people react differently...

10
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:34,859
How the disease progresses
is hard to tell.

11
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:37,122
It could be that your husband won't
even have any symptoms for a long time K

12
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,900
You might want to think about
doing something together...

13
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:46,666
a trip...

14
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,333
something a little adventurous...

15
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,612
My husband hates adventures.

16
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:10,754
He'd prefer it if
nothing changed. Ever.

17
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:13,355
Nothing. At all.

18
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:22,366
Every day he takes
the 7:28 train to Weilheim.

19
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:46,055
He used to work at the passport office.

20
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,033
Now he's the head of the
waste management department.

21
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:53,461
Recycling is good.
Reusables are better.

22
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,507
He's only been sick for one week
in twenty years. 1991.

23
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:58,509
The flu and an eardrum infection.

24
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:03,480
He eats the sandwich that I make for
him at 1 pm every day and his apple.

25
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:07,713
"An apple a day keeps the doctor away."
He says that every morning.

26
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:10,221
§An apple a day keeps the doctor away.

27
00:03:58,638 --> 00:03:59,434
Hello, Rudi.

28
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:05,270
How was your day?

29
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:06,743
So so...

30
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:13,278
Yours?

31
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:14,581
Okay.

32
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:41,078
Aren't you hungry?
- No.

33
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:47,846
Down more, Elke!

34
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,217
And with a smile, please!

35
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,926
Everything goes easier with a smile.

36
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,864
And peppy! And down!

37
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,523
Back already?

38
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:13,298
Karl Angermeier, leave messages
after the beep. Thanks.

39
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:15,840
Yes, Karl. This is Mama.

40
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:20,805
I... I wanted to... it's...

41
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:26,342
everything's okay. Talk to you soon.

42
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,941
Want to visit the children in Berlin?

43
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:57,175
Berlin? I don't know.

44
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:59,376
What if we finally went to Japan?

45
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,387
You know...
Fuji's just another mountain.

46
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,590
Yes, but we could visit Karl.

47
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:09,855
It'd be cheaper if he visited us.

48
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:11,758
Oh, Rudi!

49
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,695
Shall we go on?

50
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:20,465
I'm hungry.

51
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:16,328
Nothing to eat?

52
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,995
Rudi, we haven't been underway
for 5 minutes.

53
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,576
"An apple a day keeps the doctor away."

54
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:33,610
You want it?

55
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:34,975
No, not me.

56
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:36,514
I'll eat it later.

57
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:51,560
Imagine... the train stops in Hanau
for 2 minutes...

58
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:54,155
so if you don't get off fast...

59
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:18,450
He wanted to meet us on the platform!

60
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,454
What time is it? Look at your watch.

61
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,055
I'll give him 5 minutes and then

62
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,902
we'll take a taxi or something.

63
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:31,128
Hey!

64
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:32,860
Well...

65
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:35,838
Where were we?
- Where were you, Klaus?

66
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:36,874
Track 11...

67
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:39,376
That's where the train arrived.
- Track 11. We were there.

68
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:40,639
Klausi, hi. Klausi...
- Hi, Mama.

69
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:43,445
We waited for 20 minutes.

70
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:45,414
I waited for 20 minutes!

71
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:47,486
What?
- I'm fine.

72
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,179
Let me take it.
- No.

73
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:51,787
Straight ahead.

74
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,323
Mama, the flower bed!

75
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:03,865
Mami, can't you watch out!

76
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,301
Hello, we're... oh!

77
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:07,169
Hi.

78
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,032
Hello, Emma.

79
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:09,937
Hallo.

80
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:18,942
Robert, Celine!

81
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:22,145
How about a kiss?

82
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:23,882
Robert!

83
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,720
Have a seat. We baked a cake.

84
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:27,724
Bought one.

85
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,864
Ah!
- Let them.

86
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,802
Thanks.

87
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:44,236
Gameboy or cake?
- Let them play.

88
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:48,877
Who'd like coffee?
- No coffee for me. A beer maybe.

89
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:50,814
Uh...

90
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:52,475
Then forget it.

91
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:53,415
Okay.

92
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,250
Forgive the intrusion. Mama had the
sudden urge to visit all of you.

93
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:58,186
One after the other.

94
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,054
Karl too? That's great!

95
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,956
No, not Karl. Unfortunately.

96
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:03,926
Why not? That would be so nice.

97
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:07,158
Maybe next year. After I retire...

98
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:08,961
You'll have plenty of time.

99
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:32,124
You okay?

100
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:34,214
It just went down the wrong way.

101
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:39,929
Need some water?
- No, I'm fine.

102
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,427
Hey, where have you been?
- Sorry! Hi.

103
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:48,703
Why did they decide to come,
out of the blue like this?

104
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:49,137
No idea.

105
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:51,402
How long are they staying?
- They didn't say.

106
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:54,079
I have no time.

107
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,738
You think we do?

108
00:11:57,617 --> 00:11:58,584
Hello!

109
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:03,148
Rudi, not now.

110
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:04,552
They have to go in the fridge.

111
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:07,592
Thanks, Pop. I've only been
a vegetarian for six years.

112
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:09,661
We'll take them. We love them.

113
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:12,356
But aren't they traditionally
supposed to be eaten before noon?

114
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,228
No, no, they have to
be eaten this evening.

115
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:18,099
Alright then, we'll have them tonight.

116
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,864
You poor thing, we're taking
your room away from you.

117
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,437
It's okay.

118
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,078
You don't like them, do you?

119
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:04,171
Not really.

120
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:07,216
Thanks.

121
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:09,617
So, more sausage.
- Thanks.

122
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:13,148
Want to go sightseeing tomorrow?

123
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,561
I'll drive you around a little, okay?

124
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:18,755
Show you the city.

125
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:19,922
Oh yes.

126
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:23,661
And then we'll visit you for coffee.
- Yeah. Great.

127
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:26,567
Mama wanted to see
some dance performance...

128
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:28,697
Oh, God, do we all have to go?

129
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:32,608
A famous Butoh dancer
from Japan is in town.

130
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:35,647
Butoh, what's that?
- A modern Japanese dance form...

131
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:37,113
Have another beer?

132
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:38,148
Bring me one too?

133
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,241
But I don't have to go.
- Sure you do.

134
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,912
Let's do something
we'd all like to do.

135
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:44,421
We'd love to go with you.

136
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:59,860
Okay, Mama! Come on.

137
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:02,173
Please. "The Mayfly".

138
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:03,434
Go on, Mama.

139
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,508
Mama, Please recite it for us.

140
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:10,878
Come on, Mama, please!

141
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:14,419
"Stop! What you're doing is murder

142
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,885
"Such cruelty is not a must

143
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,218
"The mayfly has but one short day

144
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:19,348
"One single day of pain

145
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,551
One single day of lust."
- "One single day of lust"

146
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:28,263
"Oh, let it hover there.
Until it meets its end.

147
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,768
Its heaven lasts forever.
Its life one day to make amends."

148
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,099
Right, Mama?

149
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,841
Stop it!

150
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,039
Okay, it's set!
- Look at the birdy.

151
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:46,880
Come on.
- It's blinking.

152
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:48,715
Hurry!

153
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,583
Everybody smile.

154
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,681
Say 'ant shit'!

155
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,125
Papa, smile, too!
- I'm smiling already.

156
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,790
That doesn't matter.

157
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:04,595
Celine, don't you want to...
- She's not part of the family.

158
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,227
Exactly.
- Take the sunglasses off!

159
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,340
Come on! Okay, everybody.

160
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:10,430
Everbody look in the camera...

161
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:13,809
And now!

162
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:15,245
Yeahhh!

163
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,411
You're doing a great job.

164
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:25,717
A little more.

165
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,022
You're good.

166
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:35,764
Where'd you learn that?

167
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:39,104
I don't know. From me.

168
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:40,729
From you!

169
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,973
But I can't anymore.

170
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:46,135
Thank you.

171
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:48,370
It was great.

172
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:56,219
What a massage.

173
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:59,257
See, now he feels great.

174
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:11,195
I forgot to offer your parents some.

175
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,531
Karl always sends them.

176
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,573
I don't touch mine.

177
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:19,367
I'd rather eat yours.
- How sweet!

178
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,375
They are good! Hmmn?

179
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:27,515
Oh, it just occurred to me.

180
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,485
I have a meeting all day tomorrow.

181
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:32,284
You're a pain!
- I don't believe it.

182
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:33,551
What'll we do with them?

183
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,355
All you politicians do
is sit on your butts!

184
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:37,588
You told them
you'd show them around!

185
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:40,722
Sorry, but I just fogot!

186
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,198
I don't have time.

187
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:45,759
No way. I'm having them
for coffee and cake. That's plenty.

188
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:47,304
They're staying with us.

189
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,772
They're driving me nuts already.

190
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,137
Hey, they just arrived.

191
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:55,339
I hate myself for it
but they drive me crazy.

192
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:58,473
I go whacko in seconds.

193
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,552
Oh, God and I killed a fly.

194
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:02,587
That was bad.

195
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:07,682
Yes, I know. Thanks for your support,
dear. It was bad.

196
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:09,761
Yeah, "The Mayfly".

197
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:13,389
Right. And the only one of us
they're interested in is Karl.

198
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:14,261
Hmm?

199
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:17,631
I just said they're only
interested in Karl anyway.

200
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:21,194
That's always how it was.
- What I do doesn't interest them at all.

201
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:23,605
You think they care about what I do?

202
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:29,905
"Look at Karl! Isn't he cute!

203
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:35,783
Look at what he made and isn't it
nice the way he play...

204
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,220
Klaus, Leave Karl Alone! Go away!"

205
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:41,691
No. Remember?
"Karo! Klausi! Let Karli play...

206
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:44,262
Hi, sweetie!
- Hey.

207
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:49,800
What's the matter?
- I can't sleep!

208
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,637
I want to be in my room.

209
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:57,675
Yes, darling, I know.
They're not staying long.

210
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:59,971
How long?

211
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,376
Forever!

212
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:06,909
Are you tired?

213
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,647
No, not really.
- Niether am I.

214
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:12,751
Well...

215
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:15,725
I'm glad they're all doing well.
- Yes.

216
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:19,619
Funny.

217
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:24,194
I can remember them
so well as children

218
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:29,234
but now I simply
don't know who they are.

219
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:31,502
Disappointed in them?

220
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:35,475
I just don't know them anymore.

221
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,344
Well, they're all healthy.

222
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:40,849
You can't expect too much.

223
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:24,061
HAPPY AT THE PARK

224
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:44,138
How long are they staying?
- No idea.

225
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,244
You have to look after them!

226
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:51,083
How? I don't have the time.

227
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:54,255
I like your parents.
I wish mine were like yours.

228
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,259
Sure, you don't know them well.

229
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:03,261
We could get them tickets for
the show in the Friedrichstadtpalast.

230
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:06,698
My mother hates revues.

231
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:12,974
She's really gotten old.

232
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,044
Wow.

233
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,918
Yeah, strange how people change.

234
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,787
I wonder what we'll be like.

235
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:26,819
No idea.

236
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,425
We just won't get old.

237
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:33,687
What are they doing today?

238
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:38,202
I can't.

239
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:42,329
What the hell are we
going to do with them?

240
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:47,172
No, no, no

241
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:48,906
Please.

242
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:54,117
So now you're going to meow or what?

243
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:54,913
Please...

244
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,181
No. I have to go to the upholsterer.
I don't have time.

245
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:58,221
I don't either.

246
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:00,120
No, really, I have too much to do.

247
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:05,959
No! No.
- Please. Please.

248
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:11,896
No. No.
- Please.

249
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:13,596
Please.

250
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:23,680
So...

251
00:21:26,185 --> 00:21:27,812
Come on. She's here.

252
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:34,186
So now I'll show you our old apartment.
Karo and I lived up there.

253
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:40,755
Right over the bar.
Very practical. And a disaster.

254
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:43,892
But it wasn't renovated then.
We heated with coal.

255
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:49,130
Oh, man, okay! Alright already!

256
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:52,334
Sorry! Yeah,
and fuck you, too, asshole!

257
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,685
To your left
the golden dome of the synagogue.

258
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:06,417
And straight ahead
our beautiful TV tower. Look!

259
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:41,853
Wow, that must have cost.
What a cake!

260
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,258
We never bought cake at home,
did we, Mama?

261
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:48,399
Thanks for today, Franzi.

262
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,025
We saw a lot of the city. Thanks.

263
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:53,602
Thanks!

264
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:03,743
Did you have a nice time?
- Very nice, yes.

265
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:07,509
This is good beer.
I hardly ever drink beer anymore.

266
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:08,813
Thank goodness.

267
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:13,348
And Karl? Does he still drink?

268
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,119
How should I know?

269
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:18,490
Karl never drank very much.

270
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:22,793
Oh, yes he did.
Like a fish for a while.

271
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:26,598
That's absolutely not true.
- Nonsense!

272
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:28,764
Does Karli have a girlfriend in Tokyo?

273
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:31,438
Mama, you call him all the time.
Ask him next time:

274
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:34,478
"So Karli, how's it going?
Still boozing and what about chicks?"

275
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,405
So, what'll we do now?

276
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:39,841
What would you like to?

277
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,822
You're both probably tired
and want to go straight to bed.

278
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,698
It's not even six?

279
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,062
We could cook something.

280
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:00,067
No, Franzi, you've done enough.

281
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:04,935
Let's go, Rudi.

282
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:16,213
Want us to drive you home?

283
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:17,253
No.

284
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:20,184
Franzi!

285
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,590
Let us take the S-Bahn...

286
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:28,655
a little big city flair
for us country bumpkins...

287
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:29,927
Take care.

288
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:33,636
Come here.

289
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:37,875
See you tomorrow.

290
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:40,004
Tomorrow?

291
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:42,080
We have a date.
- Aha.

292
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,614
Papa!

293
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:48,747
So long!
- Bye!

294
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,485
Bye, Mama.

295
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:17,046
Are you coming?

296
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:19,243
Let's have some wine.

297
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,342
Let's drink something. Come on.

298
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,987
I'm awful...
- No!

299
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,686
Where do we have to go? Herrmannsdorf?

300
00:25:29,795 --> 00:25:30,955
What?

301
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:33,758
Berlin Center. Where is it?
Has to be in the center somewhere.

302
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,457
Give me some change.

303
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:36,534
How much?

304
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:39,968
The train's leaving! You'd know it!

305
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,805
It won't go in.
- Try it again...

306
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,372
It won't take it. How am I
supposed to buy a ticket?

307
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:45,534
Try this...

308
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,369
It won't go in. It doesn't work.

309
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:51,574
That's Berlin for you.
- Rudi, I think you need paper money.

310
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:55,141
They're out of their minds.
A machine and no tickets come out.

311
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:04,221
Wait... Berlin AB, just what I said.

312
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:05,125
What now?

313
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:08,165
We need one more.

314
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:10,461
So now we have one ticket
for either you or me or what?

315
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:14,562
Read what it says "Two people
can't use one ticket." Look here!

316
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:17,836
You can't even pay here.

317
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:22,004
Am I supposed to walk? Or you?
Or one of us doesn't pay or what?

318
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:24,013
Rudi, don't get so excited.

319
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:26,579
I'm not excited. I'm furious.

320
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:41,030
I think I want to go home.

321
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:43,198
Oh, Rudi...

322
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:44,962
The kids don't have any time for us.

323
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:52,735
The Baltic isn't far.
- Hmm?

324
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:56,909
When was the last time
we were at the beach?

325
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:58,175
At the beach?

326
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,148
I can't remember either.

327
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:02,982
1987? With the kids?

328
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:04,680
Or was that Lake Garda?

329
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:08,215
You want to go to the beach?

330
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:11,221
Yes, would you?

331
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:15,425
If you want to.
- But what do you want?

332
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:18,228
I always do whatever you say...

333
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,862
The beach isn't what
it used to be, either.

334
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:46,068
You old grouch. Aren't you cold?

335
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:47,331
You know what?

336
00:31:47,438 --> 00:31:48,632
Slip in there.

337
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,573
What?
- It's warm. Go on.

338
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:55,077
Tomorrow we'll get up early
and take a long walk on the beach.

339
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,375
What? You want to take a walk?

340
00:31:57,482 --> 00:31:58,915
Wonderful!

341
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:04,111
I'd like my ashes to
be scattered at sea.

342
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:08,190
What makes you say that?

343
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:10,727
Nothing. Don't you ever
think about that?

344
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:14,489
Really? Well, I do every now and then.
How much time we have left...

345
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:17,498
Rudi...

346
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,366
You're right.
One ought not think about it...

347
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:22,896
We've been lucky so far.

348
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:30,046
Assuming we didn't have much time
left, what would you like to do?

349
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,844
Ah, that line: Live every day
as if it were your last.

350
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,851
What nonsense.
What else should you do?

351
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:38,286
Let me tell you: I wouldn't
do anything differently. Nothing.

352
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:40,823
I'd go to work in the morning
and come home to you in the evening.

353
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:42,859
That's what I'd do.

354
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,121
Yes.

355
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:58,008
Can't you sleep?

356
00:32:58,109 --> 00:33:00,236
The surf is so loud.

357
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:13,089
And now that.
- Come on, Rudi!

358
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,758
It's nice.

359
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,965
You are and always will be loony.

360
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:31,539
Oh, come on!

361
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:32,974
What on earth are you doing?

362
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:34,601
Come on. You can't sleep anyway.

363
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:36,475
Cut it out!

364
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:40,415
Dancing in the middle of the night?
Other people are asleep.

365
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:55,084
What's with you?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.

366
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,952
What's wrong? Have you had enough?

367
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:33,587
Didn't you sleep well?

368
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,662
I didn't but you did.
- Me? Not one second.

369
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:39,828
You slept like a log.

370
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:44,970
Let's go home.

371
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:46,839
We've seen Berlin,
we've seen the Baltic,

372
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:48,878
and we've seen the children.
Let's go home.

373
00:35:50,114 --> 00:35:52,708
I thought you'd be glad to
see your children.

374
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:56,176
I don't know them. They don't know me.

375
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:00,989
Our children are better than most.

376
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:02,855
Yes, we're fortunate.

377
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:06,125
We have each other.
That's real happiness.

378
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:19,308
What is it?

379
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:21,407
Nothing.

380
00:36:22,447 --> 00:36:23,880
I just didn't get
a good night's sleep.

381
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:26,245
Whenever I woke up
you were sound asleep.

382
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:45,294
How calm the sea is.

383
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,229
As if was always that way.

384
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:51,494
It's time to rise and shine!
Come on! Get up you lazybones!

385
00:37:53,538 --> 00:37:55,267
Trudi...

386
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:02,272
Trudi...

387
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,679
Papa, Karl's here.

388
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:42,251
The sea is so calm.

389
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:53,359
Come on.

390
00:39:48,286 --> 00:39:50,652
I can't stand her lying
in that box in there.

391
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:55,124
I haven't seen her for so long
and now I'll never see her again.

392
00:39:56,394 --> 00:40:00,558
I should've visited her.
Or at least flown her to Tokyo.

393
00:40:00,665 --> 00:40:03,065
I never did anything for her.

394
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:05,997
And now there's nothing I can do.

395
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:10,439
We have to look after Papa now.

396
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:13,602
And how am I supposed to do that?
- I understand.

397
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:16,529
We never went to the beach
when we were kids.

398
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,868
No, always to the mountains, right?

399
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,169
We were in Italy once.

400
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:20,766
But not at the beach.
- Lake Garda.

401
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:22,774
Grosglockner. We took the Grosglockner
pass over the Alps, right, Papa?

402
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,507
Yeah. We all got carsick

403
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:27,140
but Mama had a plastic bag
for each of us.

404
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:29,116
She was so full of life back then.

405
00:41:31,389 --> 00:41:32,549
How old was she?

406
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:34,487
A little older than we are now.

407
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:38,187
She devoted almost her
entire life to you kids and me.

408
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,759
She wouldn't have put it that way.

409
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,634
Want me to go with you?

410
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:50,670
It's just not right. It's not fair.
She can't just leave him alone with us.

411
00:41:50,775 --> 00:41:52,834
I don't think she planned it like that.
- Yes, I know.

412
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:55,138
Mama would've been able to
get along... No problem there.

413
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:58,409
But him? What are we
supposed to do with him?

414
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:02,178
When are you flying back?

415
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:04,948
I can't stay long. My flight leaves
tomorrow afternoon from Berlin.

416
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:06,283
We have to get back, too.

417
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:08,085
So do we.
The kids are at the neighbors.

418
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,420
Who has the bag?

419
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,357
What bag?

420
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:12,361
The bag with her things. I'd like to
have the kimono if you all don't mind.

421
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:13,361
She always used to
have it on in the kitchen. No.

422
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:14,328
Yes.

423
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:17,160
It's all over. And it's impossible
to even imagine beforehand.

424
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,979
If I had known
it would end so suddenly,

425
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:40,357
I would have been nicer to her.

426
00:42:41,826 --> 00:42:45,421
Papa, nobody can know that.

427
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:49,122
Thanks for us to be able to
sit here like this.

428
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,827
She would have been
very happy you came, Karl.

429
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,933
What are you going to do now?

430
00:42:58,042 --> 00:42:59,976
I'll have to get used to it.

431
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,772
Don't worry about me.

432
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:08,106
Thanks.

433
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:11,521
Emma, give me a little more wine.

434
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:13,789
Excuse me.

435
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:35,458
My condolences.
- Thank you.

436
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,534
And this must be Karolin.

437
00:45:37,635 --> 00:45:41,901
No, no, Karolin is in Berlin.
And our youngest is in Japan.

438
00:45:42,006 --> 00:45:43,871
Ah, yes. And Klaus? Where is Klaus?

439
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,805
He has a very important meeting.
- I see.

440
00:45:47,378 --> 00:45:49,403
My condolences.

441
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:53,142
My condolences. My condolences.

442
00:45:53,784 --> 00:45:57,447
The dance performance was
what she enjoyed most in Berlin.

443
00:45:57,554 --> 00:45:59,454
She said she'd never met
a nicer girl than you.

444
00:45:59,556 --> 00:46:02,992
I'm not that nice. I don't know
why she thought that of me.

445
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:05,653
She told me about how
she always wanted to dance,

446
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:09,992
to become a really good Butoh dancer,
more than anything else in her life...

447
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:13,900
and how she would've liked to
go to Japan so much to study it there

448
00:46:14,004 --> 00:46:18,236
and how everything
turned out differently

449
00:46:18,742 --> 00:46:21,176
and that it was a good life but...
Not that you think that she wasn't happy.

450
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:25,146
No... I thought...
maybe there's another woman in her...

451
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:28,275
that nobody saw...

452
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:31,115
and I saw that other person...
that's all...

453
00:46:58,082 --> 00:46:59,049
That's her?

454
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:06,488
I didn't like it.
It was so... so extreme.

455
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:10,651
It embarrassed me...
I didn't want her to keep it up...

456
00:47:12,062 --> 00:47:14,257
We locked her up in here.

457
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:16,999
But she was happy here.

458
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:18,690
For sure.

459
00:47:20,237 --> 00:47:21,431
I don't know.

460
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:27,241
Goodbye.

461
00:47:39,123 --> 00:47:40,920
All the best.
- Thanks.

462
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:43,116
Have a good trip!
- Okay!

463
00:48:34,545 --> 00:48:37,537
One hundred Views of Mt. Fuji.

464
00:49:09,913 --> 00:49:12,711
Trudi, where are you?

465
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,419
Where?

466
00:49:59,396 --> 00:50:00,761
Papa.
- Ah!

467
00:50:00,864 --> 00:50:03,196
I thought you'd forgotten me. Hi.

468
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:06,064
I couldn't get away earlier.

469
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:08,262
How are you? Was the flight okay?
- Fine.

470
00:50:33,163 --> 00:50:34,221
Papa, come on.

471
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,254
You have to take your shoes off.

472
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:08,259
Oh, yes.

473
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:11,966
Wait...

474
00:51:18,775 --> 00:51:19,469
There.

475
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:21,476
I brought my own.
- Okay.

476
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:37,893
It's not exactly big.

477
00:51:38,729 --> 00:51:39,753
No.

478
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:49,397
Want something to drink?

479
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:04,345
Mama always sent you this.

480
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:08,515
You can't get bread like this
in Japan and the sausages.

481
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:14,120
And these, two flavors.

482
00:52:14,231 --> 00:52:15,493
Papa, I have to get back to the office.

483
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:17,760
What exactly do you do?

484
00:52:17,868 --> 00:52:19,802
I've never quite understood...

485
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:23,896
Nice of you to ask after five years.
I crunch numbers.

486
00:52:24,007 --> 00:52:25,736
What you do with garbage fees.
I do pretty much the same thing as you.

487
00:52:32,282 --> 00:52:36,810
Look... Radio, air conditioner,
satellite receiver, TV.

488
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:39,054
See you this evening, okay?

489
00:52:40,891 --> 00:52:42,483
I'll be back around six.

490
00:53:37,914 --> 00:53:41,372
My dear Karl,
here's the second stanza:

491
00:53:41,485 --> 00:53:46,184
Oh, let it hover there
until it meets its end

492
00:53:46,289 --> 00:53:52,524
lts heaven lasts forever
It's life one day to make amends

493
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:54,417
Want something else?
- No, it's fine.

494
00:54:55,892 --> 00:54:58,759
We'll think something out for you
tomorrow. I have to go out later tonight.

495
00:55:01,097 --> 00:55:01,654
Okay.

496
00:55:01,765 --> 00:55:06,600
I'm sorry that I have such little time
but I didn't have much warning.

497
00:55:06,703 --> 00:55:10,070
I don't want to get on your nerves.
- Come on, don't even say that.

498
00:55:15,278 --> 00:55:18,179
Why didn't the two of you
ever visit me?

499
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:25,477
We thought we had time.

500
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:34,328
I think I kept your mother from
what was most important to her.

501
00:55:36,967 --> 00:55:38,867
You can't do things for the dead.

502
00:55:39,736 --> 00:55:41,294
Papa...

503
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:04,478
Look, here's some yen.
I'll pick you up later.

504
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:07,488
Don't move from here.
I don't want you to get lost. Look,

505
00:57:08,491 --> 00:57:10,618
I work over there.
- Which building?

506
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:13,161
Next to the black one.
So, I'll pick you up later. Bye.

507
00:57:29,212 --> 00:57:31,612
Uh... beer.

508
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:49,693
Thank you.

509
00:58:24,467 --> 00:58:26,401
Ahungu what?

510
01:00:45,508 --> 01:00:48,500
Nein, I'm, I'm not understand.

511
01:00:53,182 --> 01:00:54,672
Oh, no, es ist, it's good, it's good.

512
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:10,188
Hey! Where were you? Are you crazy?

513
01:02:10,293 --> 01:02:13,694
I was so worried.
I thought I'd lost you for good.

514
01:02:13,796 --> 01:02:15,525
Unbelievable!

515
01:02:15,632 --> 01:02:18,157
The doorbells, I couldn't read them.

516
01:02:18,267 --> 01:02:19,632
Who told you to go anywhere?

517
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:21,101
You can't read anything here.

518
01:02:21,204 --> 01:02:22,432
I told you to stay put.
- I don't understand anything.

519
01:02:22,538 --> 01:02:23,129
I told you to stay where you were.

520
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:25,070
Do you have any idea
how big this city is?

521
01:02:25,642 --> 01:02:27,200
How easy it is to get lost?

522
01:04:53,099 --> 01:04:55,158
Hi, Papa.
- Hello.

523
01:04:56,228 --> 01:04:58,924
How was your day?
- So so.

524
01:05:02,733 --> 01:05:04,496
Didn't you go out?
- No.

525
01:05:11,141 --> 01:05:12,631
Know how my cell works?

526
01:05:14,812 --> 01:05:15,744
Look,

527
01:05:17,581 --> 01:05:20,015
here. Just one button.

528
01:05:20,117 --> 01:05:22,950
I saw it. It has a picture of you.
- Right.

529
01:05:23,053 --> 01:05:24,611
Look, that's my phone number.

530
01:05:28,258 --> 01:05:30,123
Did you eat anything?
- Yes.

531
01:05:31,962 --> 01:05:33,361
No, you didn't.

532
01:05:36,633 --> 01:05:38,464
I don't understand where Trudi is.

533
01:05:39,870 --> 01:05:41,497
Where her body is.

534
01:05:44,708 --> 01:05:47,074
My memories of her are in my body,

535
01:05:47,177 --> 01:05:49,304
but when my body's no longer here,
where will Trudi be then?

536
01:05:49,413 --> 01:05:54,441
Papa... Papa,
I'm grieving for Mama, too...

537
01:05:54,551 --> 01:05:56,348
but... really...

538
01:05:56,453 --> 01:06:00,856
Don't tell me life goes on. Please.

539
01:06:15,372 --> 01:06:16,566
Come on, now!

540
01:06:20,043 --> 01:06:22,511
You know, this is Bavarian Style.

541
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,072
This is Bavarian Style.

542
01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:38,693
Cherry blossoms... The most beautiful
symbol for impermanence...

543
01:06:38,795 --> 01:06:41,730
They'e only here for a few days.

544
01:06:41,832 --> 01:06:43,800
And then they're gone.

545
01:06:43,901 --> 01:06:46,096
That's it.

546
01:07:00,517 --> 01:07:03,008
Papa, that's my Papa!

547
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:04,417
Nice, huh, Papa!

548
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:11,218
Kampai, kampai, kampai!

549
01:07:23,507 --> 01:07:25,634
Don't treat me like a child!

550
01:07:25,742 --> 01:07:27,573
It's bedtime.

551
01:07:28,845 --> 01:07:32,406
This will be the first time
you've ever put me to bed.

552
01:07:32,516 --> 01:07:34,575
You of all people! Hilarious!

553
01:07:34,685 --> 01:07:37,176
How can anyone get so loaded?

554
01:07:37,287 --> 01:07:39,517
Everyone always has to look after you.
- Come on now.

555
01:07:39,623 --> 01:07:42,854
You always have to be
the center of attention.

556
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:44,291
Give me your arm!

557
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:46,157
Be considerate of your father!
Your poor father!

558
01:07:46,263 --> 01:07:48,424
Leave your father alone! He's tired!

559
01:07:48,532 --> 01:07:53,902
He works so hard!
Works his ass off in the office!

560
01:07:54,004 --> 01:07:54,868
So, that's enough.

561
01:07:54,972 --> 01:07:56,701
You spent your entire life
hiding in your office!

562
01:07:56,807 --> 01:07:58,536
You never even really knew Mama!

563
01:07:58,642 --> 01:08:02,078
You have no idea who she was!

564
01:08:02,179 --> 01:08:05,615
No idea, you old fool, you.

565
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:08,139
Get out!

566
01:08:08,251 --> 01:08:11,618
Go back to your garbage trucks,
that's where you belong.

567
01:08:11,722 --> 01:08:13,519
And don't forget to recycle!

568
01:08:15,459 --> 01:08:18,917
"An Apple a day, keeps a doctor away."

569
01:08:30,474 --> 01:08:31,463
So... So.

570
01:08:38,215 --> 01:08:39,375
So, I have to go.

571
01:08:40,283 --> 01:08:42,342
Wait... Here.

572
01:08:55,332 --> 01:08:56,424
Oh, Papa.

573
01:08:58,602 --> 01:09:01,867
Stop. Your apple.

574
01:09:01,972 --> 01:09:04,736
"An apple a day, keeps the doctor away."
...keeps the doctor away.

575
01:09:04,841 --> 01:09:05,830
Bye.

576
01:09:06,410 --> 01:09:07,342
So long.

577
01:09:10,013 --> 01:09:11,810
What is this?

578
01:09:13,150 --> 01:09:14,583
Metal.

579
01:09:14,685 --> 01:09:20,920
Plastic. Plastic. Metal. Metal.

580
01:09:21,024 --> 01:09:23,424
Paper. Paper.

581
01:10:43,588 --> 01:10:46,648
So, Trudi, that's for you.

582
01:11:18,890 --> 01:11:21,256
Papa, what are you doing in the dark?

583
01:11:21,893 --> 01:11:23,053
Nothing.

584
01:11:24,162 --> 01:11:26,426
And? So what did you do today?

585
01:11:27,599 --> 01:11:28,463
Nothing special.

586
01:11:28,567 --> 01:11:30,535
But you can't just do nothing all day.

587
01:11:33,505 --> 01:11:34,836
I have a lot to do. I remember.

588
01:11:35,941 --> 01:11:38,910
I think about your mother.

589
01:11:39,010 --> 01:11:40,443
Show her Tokyo.

590
01:11:43,448 --> 01:11:44,881
Oh.

591
01:11:47,185 --> 01:11:49,449
What about a sightseeing tour?

592
01:11:51,223 --> 01:11:53,748
Is it far to Mt. Fuji?

593
01:11:53,859 --> 01:11:55,827
About two hours.

594
01:11:57,095 --> 01:11:59,120
I'd take you if I had time

595
01:12:01,099 --> 01:12:03,329
but people here work weekends, too.

596
01:12:07,939 --> 01:12:11,170
Did you know that "ah so"
in Japanese is "ah so"?

597
01:12:43,642 --> 01:12:45,837
Free - free Hugs.

598
01:12:47,412 --> 01:12:48,106
Free?
- Yeah.

599
01:12:48,213 --> 01:12:48,872
Money?

600
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:50,811
No Money. It's all free.

601
01:12:52,350 --> 01:12:53,044
What, what is?

602
01:13:02,527 --> 01:13:03,551
Thank you.
- Thank you.

603
01:13:03,662 --> 01:13:04,321
Okay.

604
01:13:06,531 --> 01:13:07,259
Good-bye.
- Thank you.

605
01:15:20,532 --> 01:15:23,262
...listen to me...

606
01:15:23,368 --> 01:15:24,767
No. Yes.

607
01:15:26,438 --> 01:15:28,372
Here's not here for a change.

608
01:15:28,473 --> 01:15:29,872
He's driving me crazy.

609
01:15:29,974 --> 01:15:31,805
He sits around here all day long.

610
01:15:31,910 --> 01:15:33,172
I don't know what to do with him.

611
01:15:33,278 --> 01:15:35,075
He's already been on every
sightseeing tour in town.

612
01:15:35,180 --> 01:15:38,274
I can't come up with a program for him
every day. I just don't have the time.

613
01:15:38,383 --> 01:15:40,749
I'm sorry, but he's really
getting on my nerves.

614
01:15:41,853 --> 01:15:43,912
And he's behaving so strangely.

615
01:15:44,022 --> 01:15:48,083
Did you know that
he brought all his money?

616
01:15:48,193 --> 01:15:51,458
Yes and he brought Mama's clothes,
too. Yes, really.

617
01:15:52,030 --> 01:15:56,592
I don't know but I think he
needs therapy. He can't cope.

618
01:15:56,701 --> 01:15:58,134
Yes but I can't cope either.

619
01:15:58,236 --> 01:16:00,295
You'll have to take him.

620
01:16:00,405 --> 01:16:01,633
Or Klaus.

621
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:03,867
No... but now it's your turn...

622
01:16:09,814 --> 01:16:11,406
How long have you been there?

623
01:16:13,351 --> 01:16:16,252
Let me just stay here with you
a little longer. Just a little. Please.

624
01:16:17,389 --> 01:16:20,119
Sure.

625
01:16:21,059 --> 01:16:23,687
I'm sorry.

626
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:50,238
Excuse me...

627
01:17:52,383 --> 01:17:54,044
are you a dancer?

628
01:17:55,019 --> 01:17:56,646
Butoh dancer?

629
01:17:57,489 --> 01:17:59,047
Yes.

630
01:17:59,157 --> 01:18:00,419
I have a question...

631
01:18:02,927 --> 01:18:04,417
Ask me.

632
01:18:06,831 --> 01:18:10,232
Butoh is dance of shadow.

633
01:18:10,335 --> 01:18:13,327
Not me dance. Shadow dance.

634
01:18:15,707 --> 01:18:20,235
Watch. And your shadow dance.

635
01:18:25,617 --> 01:18:27,881
I don't know who is the shadow.

636
01:18:29,187 --> 01:18:32,452
Hello! Hello! Who are you?

637
01:18:35,827 --> 01:18:37,192
No answer.

638
01:18:39,664 --> 01:18:42,724
Everybody can dance Butoh.
- No.

639
01:18:43,601 --> 01:18:46,570
Yes. Yes.

640
01:18:46,671 --> 01:18:48,332
Everybody can.

641
01:18:49,007 --> 01:18:50,907
Everybody has shadow.

642
01:18:51,543 --> 01:18:53,374
Young and old.

643
01:18:53,478 --> 01:18:55,639
Woman and man.

644
01:18:55,747 --> 01:19:00,878
And everybody alive.
And everybody dead.

645
01:19:00,985 --> 01:19:02,543
The same time.

646
01:19:09,961 --> 01:19:12,020
I dance with the dead.

647
01:19:13,865 --> 01:19:15,457
Who is dead?

648
01:19:15,567 --> 01:19:16,795
My mother.

649
01:19:16,901 --> 01:19:17,765
When?

650
01:19:18,670 --> 01:19:20,900
Yesterday, one year.

651
01:19:23,007 --> 01:19:27,171
She loves the telephone.
Pink telephone.

652
01:19:27,278 --> 01:19:30,907
Always on the phone with family.

653
01:19:31,015 --> 01:19:33,677
My wife, too. Much telephone.

654
01:19:33,785 --> 01:19:35,912
Three children. Always telephone.

655
01:19:36,988 --> 01:19:40,822
Now, I am on the phone with my mother.

656
01:19:40,925 --> 01:19:42,517
All the time.

657
01:19:43,595 --> 01:19:45,392
She is in me.

658
01:19:49,033 --> 01:19:50,500
Where is your wife?

659
01:19:53,905 --> 01:19:55,896
I don't know.

660
01:19:56,007 --> 01:19:57,804
I don't know where she is.

661
01:19:58,076 --> 01:20:02,979
You feel the memory,
the past, past memory.

662
01:20:03,081 --> 01:20:09,111
And - we feel the wind.

663
01:20:09,220 --> 01:20:16,058
And always see your...

664
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:21,723
And hold - hold - hold - yes, hold!

665
01:20:21,833 --> 01:20:25,360
And you find the many shadow.

666
01:20:25,470 --> 01:20:27,961
Inside of you.

667
01:20:28,072 --> 01:20:30,666
And shadows gone

668
01:20:35,179 --> 01:20:41,277
Yes, yes.
Hold - hold - hold - catch!

669
01:20:41,386 --> 01:20:45,516
Catch the shadow.
And feel the shadow.

670
01:20:47,692 --> 01:20:51,890
Dance is better without the coat.

671
01:20:51,996 --> 01:20:54,123
No.

672
01:21:00,271 --> 01:21:01,260
It... it's not me.

673
01:21:02,206 --> 01:21:03,730
It's my wife.

674
01:21:07,145 --> 01:21:08,544
What's your name?

675
01:21:08,646 --> 01:21:09,340
Yu.

676
01:21:09,447 --> 01:21:10,880
Not me. You!

677
01:21:10,982 --> 01:21:12,574
I am Yu.

678
01:21:12,684 --> 01:21:14,015
You are me?

679
01:21:14,118 --> 01:21:16,848
No, my name is Yu!
- Oh.

680
01:21:17,388 --> 01:21:18,650
What is your name?

681
01:21:18,756 --> 01:21:19,745
Rudi.

682
01:21:20,191 --> 01:21:24,059
Rudi? Rudi... Rudi!

683
01:21:24,162 --> 01:21:26,722
Yes. Rudi.

684
01:21:26,831 --> 01:21:28,059
Rudi!

685
01:21:58,129 --> 01:22:02,896
So... in here... and-

686
01:22:09,107 --> 01:22:13,066
Oh, train is coming!

687
01:22:14,078 --> 01:22:15,705
You take this.

688
01:22:25,189 --> 01:22:28,920
Okay, goodbye! See you!

689
01:23:07,832 --> 01:23:12,394
Cabbage?

690
01:23:12,503 --> 01:23:13,026
Mino.

691
01:23:13,137 --> 01:23:14,331
White cabbage.

692
01:23:16,841 --> 01:23:19,776
Cabbage. Cabbage.

693
01:23:26,083 --> 01:23:30,110
Okay. Thanks. And a...

694
01:23:33,691 --> 01:23:34,680
Goodbye!

695
01:23:36,994 --> 01:23:38,586
It works.

696
01:23:41,399 --> 01:23:42,331
It works!

697
01:23:44,268 --> 01:23:47,704
So... What did she do?

698
01:24:03,487 --> 01:24:05,387
So... Mama's recipe.

699
01:24:05,489 --> 01:24:07,252
I have to go out.

700
01:24:07,358 --> 01:24:08,552
One.

701
01:24:09,794 --> 01:24:10,488
Thanks.

702
01:24:11,462 --> 01:24:13,157
That's two.
- Sure.

703
01:24:19,537 --> 01:24:20,367
Thanks.

704
01:24:23,741 --> 01:24:25,709
Enjoy!
- Thanks.

705
01:25:02,813 --> 01:25:04,644
I miss Mama so.

706
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:12,456
And after going as far away as I could

707
01:25:12,556 --> 01:25:14,854
so I wouldn't be so dependent on her.

708
01:25:25,803 --> 01:25:27,998
And where did I go?

709
01:25:30,041 --> 01:25:32,475
To the place
she always wanted to go to.

710
01:25:36,681 --> 01:25:38,205
And now she never saw it.

711
01:25:45,156 --> 01:25:46,748
There are no flies here.

712
01:25:48,159 --> 01:25:49,148
What?

713
01:25:49,527 --> 01:25:50,459
Flies.

714
01:25:51,595 --> 01:25:53,529
I haven't seen a single fly here.

715
01:25:58,903 --> 01:26:00,097
That's right.

716
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:16,518
Now happy together. Not separate.

717
01:26:19,256 --> 01:26:21,224
Very good. You make?

718
01:26:21,325 --> 01:26:24,089
Yes. From my wife.

719
01:26:26,163 --> 01:26:31,999
Uh, Uh, you take ahm,
the Kohl, am, na, ah,

720
01:26:32,103 --> 01:26:34,970
I don't know the word in English, ah,

721
01:26:35,072 --> 01:26:41,341

723
01:27:10,374 --> 01:27:12,968
Now, two cabbage rolls.

724
01:27:27,792 --> 01:27:30,090
Where you live? Uh... Home.

725
01:27:30,194 --> 01:27:31,456
Me? Home?
- Yes.

726
01:27:31,562 --> 01:27:32,995
Oh, another direction.

727
01:27:33,731 --> 01:27:37,428
Where is that... other direction?

728
01:27:37,535 --> 01:27:40,595
Not, not here, maybe you don't know.
- Where?

729
01:27:40,704 --> 01:27:42,672
I'm okay.
- Yes, okay.

730
01:27:42,773 --> 01:27:44,263
Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

731
01:27:44,375 --> 01:27:46,502
Okay. See you.
- Okay.

732
01:27:46,610 --> 01:27:48,942
Okay, take care.

733
01:29:41,859 --> 01:29:45,920
Hello. You are late so much.

734
01:29:46,030 --> 01:29:48,430
Why?

735
01:29:48,532 --> 01:29:50,124
Sorry, I...

736
01:29:51,769 --> 01:29:54,169
I waited.

737
01:30:27,538 --> 01:30:30,564
My home. In winter much snow.

738
01:30:30,674 --> 01:30:33,234
Snow, snow snow.

739
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:34,572
Where do you live?

740
01:30:38,482 --> 01:30:40,279
In a tent? No.

741
01:30:42,653 --> 01:30:47,056
Camping. Me and my wife in summer
all the time Autobahn.

742
01:30:47,157 --> 01:30:49,455
My wife did'nt like it very much...

743
01:30:53,931 --> 01:30:56,832
My wife... like this.

744
01:30:59,270 --> 01:31:00,931
Wildcat?

745
01:31:01,939 --> 01:31:05,375
Wildcat. In a cage.

746
01:31:07,378 --> 01:31:09,369
My mother like this.

747
01:31:11,548 --> 01:31:12,537
A duck?

748
01:31:16,186 --> 01:31:20,122
Up and down, up and down.

749
01:31:20,224 --> 01:31:24,752
Happy and sad. Happy and sad.

750
01:31:27,898 --> 01:31:29,160
Hello, mother.

751
01:34:49,867 --> 01:34:51,596
Papa, you don't understand.

752
01:34:51,702 --> 01:34:54,296
All day long I'm in a tiny office
with other people.

753
01:34:54,404 --> 01:34:56,872
When I get home at night
I need a little space for myself.

754
01:34:56,974 --> 01:34:57,736
She's almost still a child.

755
01:34:57,841 --> 01:35:00,935
Papa, In Japan nobody her age
has to live on the street.

756
01:35:01,044 --> 01:35:01,874
It's her own choice.

757
01:35:01,979 --> 01:35:03,537
Nobody chooses to live like that.

758
01:35:03,647 --> 01:35:05,376
Papa, just believe me.

759
01:35:05,482 --> 01:35:06,847
It's what she wants.

760
01:35:06,950 --> 01:35:08,178
You're like a different person.

761
01:35:08,285 --> 01:35:10,515
When did you become so callous?
How did that happen?

762
01:37:12,576 --> 01:37:14,874
Hello.
- Hello.

763
01:37:22,919 --> 01:37:25,854
My wife wants to go on trip.

764
01:37:28,091 --> 01:37:29,683
Do you come with her?

765
01:38:01,792 --> 01:38:02,759
Thank you.

766
01:38:15,439 --> 01:38:16,497
You want?

767
01:38:20,477 --> 01:38:26,143
This looks... uh, looks like
raspberry ice cream, uh, an a ice.

768
01:38:28,585 --> 01:38:31,645
Ice cream?
- Ice, ice, of a berry.

769
01:38:33,657 --> 01:38:35,750
Yeah, something...

770
01:38:44,167 --> 01:38:47,034
What if we don't see him?

771
01:38:47,137 --> 01:38:51,631
Him? Mr Mount Fuji? Is he a man?

772
01:38:51,742 --> 01:38:57,977
Yes. Mr Mountain is very shy.

773
01:38:59,483 --> 01:39:01,747
Now many clouds.

774
01:39:01,852 --> 01:39:05,618
Very often he don't
want us to see him.

775
01:39:10,160 --> 01:39:12,560
Shy, very shy.

776
01:39:34,351 --> 01:39:36,478
Where is Mr Mount Fuji?

777
01:39:39,289 --> 01:39:40,881
I ask for her.

778
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:47,563
...Where is Fuji?

779
01:40:19,663 --> 01:40:20,687
Aha.

780
01:40:40,016 --> 01:40:41,142
No mountain.

781
01:40:43,220 --> 01:40:47,714
So, I say to you he is very shy.

782
01:41:20,857 --> 01:41:22,484
Shoes.

783
01:41:22,592 --> 01:41:23,581
Oh, yes.

784
01:41:31,134 --> 01:41:34,103
There are no beds. No bed.

785
01:41:38,341 --> 01:41:39,205
Ah.

786
01:41:39,976 --> 01:41:41,170
Good bed.

787
01:42:10,607 --> 01:42:12,438
I go have dinner like this?

788
01:42:17,981 --> 01:42:19,972
It's too tight?
- No, no. No.

789
01:42:22,619 --> 01:42:23,677
Good.

790
01:42:25,522 --> 01:42:26,454
Good.

791
01:42:28,058 --> 01:42:29,218
And this.

792
01:42:34,998 --> 01:42:36,056
Ha.

793
01:42:38,568 --> 01:42:39,728
Great.

794
01:43:20,577 --> 01:43:21,805
...Beer...

795
01:44:40,290 --> 01:44:42,781
Uh, what is this?
- Chicken.

796
01:44:42,892 --> 01:44:44,257
Hm?
- Chicken.

797
01:44:45,128 --> 01:44:46,095
Ah.

798
01:44:47,397 --> 01:44:49,160
Hendl in German.
- Hendl...

799
01:44:54,237 --> 01:44:57,729
No!

800
01:51:09,545 --> 01:51:12,912
Rudi? Rudi?

801
01:51:13,983 --> 01:51:15,143
Rudi!

802
01:51:23,626 --> 01:51:24,957
Rudi!

803
01:51:32,668 --> 01:51:33,794
Rudi!

804
01:51:38,307 --> 01:51:39,865
Rudi!

805
01:52:30,893 --> 01:52:36,024
(FOR YOU, YU, FROM RUDI)

806
01:55:28,971 --> 01:55:31,838
Thank you for everything
you did for my father.

807
01:55:32,842 --> 01:55:34,833
I did not do anything.

808
01:55:36,846 --> 01:55:38,575
Your father happy now.

809
01:55:40,249 --> 01:55:41,409
You think so?

810
01:55:54,964 --> 01:55:58,331
Your father. Your mother.

811
01:56:02,772 --> 01:56:04,034
Aha.

812
01:57:02,364 --> 01:57:07,324
My condolences.

813
01:57:14,076 --> 01:57:15,941
We're orphans now,
in less than half a year.

814
01:57:16,045 --> 01:57:17,205
It's all like a dream.

815
01:57:17,313 --> 01:57:18,871
I can't even believe I'm here.

816
01:57:18,981 --> 01:57:21,848
What you told us is so off the wall.

817
01:57:21,951 --> 01:57:23,714
It doesn't sound like Papa.

818
01:57:23,819 --> 01:57:25,684
He couldn't take Mama's death.

819
01:57:25,788 --> 01:57:27,483
In a hotel.

820
01:57:28,190 --> 01:57:29,521
With an eighteen-year-old girl.

821
01:57:29,625 --> 01:57:30,819
In women's clothes.

822
01:57:30,926 --> 01:57:32,120
