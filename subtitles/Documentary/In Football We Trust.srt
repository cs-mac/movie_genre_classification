He's not gonna need
one penny from you guys.

631
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:42,359
If you want to play
pro football,

632
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:44,061
we have
the blueprint.

633
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:46,029
My highlight
of the whole night

634
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:47,097
was when he sat there
and he said,

635
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:48,098
"What do you want?"

636
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:49,666
He said, "I want to
be the best.

637
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:51,635
"I want to be the best.

638
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:52,836
I'm driven
to be the best."

639
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:54,504
I know he's coming
to USC.

640
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:55,706
Harvey, voice-over:
All the coaches told me

641
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:58,308
how good my work ethic is
and how crazy it was

642
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:00,243
seeing me in person because
they thought that I was just

643
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:04,081
a--a big Polynesian that just
knew how to run over

644
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:07,084
little, small white
kids in Utah.

645
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,385
If he doesn't graduate

646
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:10,387
and he leaves
to go to the NFL,

647
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:14,124
we still help him
get back to school,

648
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:17,661
and we still help him
with the tuition.

649
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:19,262
If he comes with me,
he's family.

650
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,764
We'll take care
of him. OK?

651
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,467
We can even say the
prayer before we leave.

652
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:26,069
This is a hard
business, you know,

653
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:27,304
and this is what you
do for a living.

654
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:28,839
You try to get
good players like this,

655
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:30,741
but you understand,
you know.

656
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:31,908
You just have to do

657
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:32,909
the best you can.

658
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:34,344
Yeah.

659
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:35,746
Harvey, voice-over: If I keep
making these right choices

660
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:38,582
and keep my head straight,

661
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:41,251
then things will just start
falling in place, you know.

662
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:44,187
I'll--I'll get my degree.

663
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:46,890
I'll go on and get
a good-paying job,

664
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:49,159
or I'll be in the League.

665
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,228
We would love
to have you at Utah.

666
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:53,330
Harvey, voice-over: And if
I'm in the League, you know,

667
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:54,564
the first couple of checks go

668
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:55,532
straight to
the family, you know.

669
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,300
It's not gonna go to me,
you know.

670
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:00,537
The first checks can go to Mom,
the second check to Dad,

671
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:03,907
you know, the third check
to Michelle, Paul,

672
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:05,442
and all the way down the list.

673
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:08,311
I could just--that's how
it's gonna be.

674
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:11,481
Our dear most gracious
heavenly Father,

675
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:14,317
We bow our heads
and give thanks

676
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:15,919
in gratitude.

677
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:20,390
Harvey, voice-over:
It's time.

678
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:23,060
I got to go to SC,
and I'm gonna bust my butt

679
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:27,197
and show everyone that I can be
a Polynesian running back.

680
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:28,131
Thanks again.

681
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,067
Woman: Ah.
This is wonderful.

682
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:32,335
Man: Just a coronation
with you.

683
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:38,675
Newsman: Bingham High
running back Harvey Langi,

684
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,210
the top recruit in Utah,

685
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:43,113
was suspended for the Miners'
opener today against Hunter

686
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:44,514
for trespassing.

687
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:45,615
Considered by most pundits to be

688
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:48,118
the top high-school football
player in Utah...

689
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:50,520
Police officers said
they smelled marijuana,

690
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,089
and Langi first admitted
that he smoked it.

691
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:53,657
Then he said he didn't.

692
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:15,779
Coach: Do you feel like
to break somebody's will

693
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:18,415
you've got to have that
desire and that passion

694
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:19,883
before you step
on the field,

695
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,918
before it happens?

696
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:23,954
Sit up and listen, OK?

697
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:26,022
If you're not paying
attention right now,

698
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,824
act like you're sleeping, OK,

699
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:30,160
then walk out of
the room right now!

700
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:33,029
Either get your eyes up
and make eye contact

701
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:35,132
or get out!

702
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:40,570
Harvey, voice-over:
Coach Peck sat us down,

703
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,939
and he just started yelling.

704
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:46,143
"Why is there marijuana
in your guys' case?

705
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:50,847
"I don't care who you are.
I don't care how good you are.

706
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:53,483
"I want you to voluntarily
take a drug test,

707
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:56,286
and if you don't pass it,
you're off our team."

708
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:02,058
Kalasita: Here you are,

709
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:03,059
put our family over here.

710
00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:04,194
Here you are putting our family

711
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:06,963
to what? To hell.

712
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:09,733
Newswoman: It happened
this morning

713
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,102
at Hunter High School
in West Valley City.

714
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,571
A 16-year-old came to school
armed with a gun.

715
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:15,672
Sandy, this is scary.

716
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:16,940
Sandy: Yeah, it really is, Hope.

717
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,408
Police say
two 16-year-olds

718
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:20,210
got into a fight
out here

719
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:22,045
early this morning
before school.

720
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:23,580
At one point,
one of the students

721
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:26,283
goes inside the building
and comes back out

722
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,617
with a handgun.

723
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:29,686
He threatens to kill
his classmate,

724
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:33,023
then turns the gun on a crowd
that had gathered.

725
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:35,559
Woman: Hi, Grant.
This is Maile.

726
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:38,595
The young man who brought
the gun to school--

727
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:41,298
his name is Leva Bloomfield.

728
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:48,305
He is right now sitting
in my police officer's office.

729
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,974
He's doing the paperwork,
and the police officer

730
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,476
is going to take him to DT.

731
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:18,668
You say, you say,
you say,

732
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:19,669
"I don't want to do this.

733
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:20,670
"I don't want to go
to prison.

734
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,472
"I don't want to be
like my uncles.

735
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,773
I don't want to do this,"

736
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:26,376
and then you pull
something like this today?

737
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:35,485
Well, just, uh...

738
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:42,225
We were walking back
from [Indistinct] this morning,

739
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:44,928
and some of the Mexican kids
were smoking outside,

740
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:47,297
and they pulled
a knife out on...

741
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:49,899
Yeah. They pulled
a knife out on Leva.

742
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:52,569
Out of nowhere.

743
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:54,271
Oh, man.

744
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:56,339
Leva ran inside
to grab his strap

745
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:58,942
from the locker,
and he ran out,

746
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,777
and he pulled it out
on the kid.

747
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:03,747
I don't--

748
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,650
No.

749
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:08,518
I didn't even know
he had it.

750
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:11,621
I didn't know he'd
bring it to school.

751
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:13,590
So then what
happened?

752
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:18,495
Uh, then Leva--
I took it from Leva

753
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:19,663
when I see--when I see--

754
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,264
So Leva
brought it out.

755
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:22,265
Then he grabs
the gun and runs,

756
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:23,333
like, out
to the guy,

757
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:25,702
and the kid's still
there, waving his knife?

758
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,904
Kauata: Look at your brother.
Now he's in trouble.

759
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,839
He's got suspended
to the district

760
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:31,941
because he's trying
to look out for you,

761
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:34,244
but he's not doing you
any justice.

762
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,879
Is he doing you
justice, babe?

763
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:37,414
No.

764
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,749
And do you know
how much he loves you?

765
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:43,586
He will screw up
everything for you.

766
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:48,491
He will screw up
his scholarship for you.

767
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:50,694
Do--do you
realize that?

768
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:53,563
I want to be
the proud Mom

769
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:56,433
who goes in and checks
in at the ticket box

770
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,002
and is like, "My son
is playing today."

771
00:39:01,706 --> 00:39:03,106
"My son is playing
football today."

772
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,041
That's where
I want to be.

773
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:12,582
Honey, you've got to--

774
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:15,218
you have got to
want more.

775
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:27,731
You know he can't fire.

776
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:29,899
That's why he's pulling
a frickin' knife.

777
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:32,369
I don't know.

778
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:34,337
What do you mean,
you don't know?

779
00:39:41,912 --> 00:39:48,318
Kauata: The gun was loaded,
ready to be shot.

780
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:51,354
And you--you did know
he had the gun.

781
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:53,356
Vita: No. It wasn't
the same gun. He had--

782
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:55,258
Oh, so there's
another gun?

783
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:57,627
Yeah. Exactly.

784
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:03,633
No one's going to DT
but Leva.

785
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:05,168
Oh, but it's all right
they're gonna keep

when men had to fight
for their very existence,

805
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:23,780
there was a group of men.

They called themselves
the Lords of Bruges.

They had a family motto.

It is written on the board.

"Plus est en vous."

00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:35,091
What that translates, OK,

811

is "you have more to give."

812
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:41,898
So when they'd be out
on a battlefield, OK?

813

and they'd be hurt
and they'd be tired

and they'd start to get
knocked down,

815

you'd hear this cry:
"Plus est en vous!"

That's a must. Your

Aaron: That's a--
you know, that's a big thing

970
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:56,485
for us is, we're trying
to win a football game.

Yup.

00:50:58,555 --> 00:50:59,488
Yes.

00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:00,423
For athletics?

975
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:02,391
Yup. What's your
academic interest

976
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:03,392
in college?

977
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:04,660
Uh, psychology.

978
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:06,662
OK.

979
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,297
A lot of the NAIA
schools

980
00:51:08,365 --> 00:51:09,965
are gonna be private
institutions,

very
educational-based.

982
00:51:12,169 --> 00:51:14,904
We like to think
that NAIA football

983
00:51:14,971 --> 00:51:16,038
is a little bit
better

984
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:17,873
than Division III
football,

985
00:51:17,941 --> 00:51:20,276
more similar to
lower-end Division II.

986
00:51:20,343 --> 00:51:21,277
Yeah.
OK?

987
00:51:21,344 --> 00:51:22,211
Yeah.

988
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:23,279
It's good
to meet you.

989

gonna last so long,

about what I want

1010

to do, you know?

to Utah just because
he'll be close to home.

The problem is--
the problem is

1056
00:55:56,786 --> 00:55:59,054
I said to myself...

1057
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:05,894
And then this stupid thing
that happened with the police

1058
00:56:05,962 --> 00:56:08,397
and stuff, and I got suspended.

1059

Everyone hated me.

1060
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:17,239
I went to school.
No one liked me.

1061
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:19,875
But then when I do good
in football and all this stuff,

1062
00:56:19,943 --> 00:56:22,177
they come up, like,
"Oh, what's up, Harv?"

1063
00:56:22,245 --> 00:56:24,480
And then right when
I leave, they hate me.

Vai: The thing
that's difficult

1070
00:56:47,704 --> 00:56:49,538
for the kids
that are growing up

1071
00:56:49,606 --> 00:56:53,809
is that their parents expect
them to play in the NFL

1072
00:56:53,877 --> 00:56:57,212
at the cost of everything else.

1073

It's hard to get in there,
and it's hard--

1074
00:56:59,349 --> 00:57:00,849
it's hard to get in there.

1075
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:03,385
It's even harder to stay.

1076
00:57:03,453 --> 00:57:05,554
Um, and if kids grow up
thinking,

1077
00:57:05,622 --> 00:57:08,657
"Well, that's all I'm gonna do
and nothing else,"

um, it's--they're a long shot

1081
00:57:32,315 --> 00:57:35,083
It's been two months.

1082
00:57:35,151 --> 00:57:37,152
Vita, voice-over: He could
get an early release,

1083

but I don't think--
I don't see that happening.

please?

We're here for

1091
00:57:55,071 --> 00:57:57,372
Leva Bloomfield's
hearing.

1092
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,241
You need to put
all your personal items--

1093
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:02,211
your phones, purses--
in your vehicles.

1094
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:16,859
So they only gave him
15 months and time served.

1095
00:58:16,926 --> 00:58:17,860
They were supposed
to add on

1096
00:58:17,927 --> 00:58:19,127
two more years
to this...

1097
00:58:19,195 --> 00:58:20,696
Yeah.
and they didn't.

1098
00:58:20,763 --> 00:58:21,697
Man: Why?

1099
00:58:21,764 --> 00:58:23,265
Because every
aggravated charge

1100
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,767
that he got--
and he has 5--

1101
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:28,036
is 6 months for each
aggravated charge,

1102
00:58:28,104 --> 00:58:29,171
but they decided
not to

1103
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:30,405
because of his

Fihi, voice-over:
We won the championship,

1267
01:07:28,811 --> 01:07:30,545
and it feels like, you know,
those people who go to war

1268
01:07:30,613 --> 01:07:32,747
and then, you know, they won
and they come back,

they don't even speak
about it, you know?

1270
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:47,429
The ACL is gone.
It's just completely torn,

1271
01:07:47,496 --> 01:07:49,164
and then the inner
and the outer meniscus

1272
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:52,734
are all torn, and so they
had to fix it all up.

1273
01:07:58,007 --> 01:07:59,541
After I tore the MCL,
I kept playing,

1274
01:07:59,608 --> 01:08:01,276
and then I tore the meniscus.

1275
01:08:01,343 --> 01:08:03,778
Then I kept playing,
and then I tore the ACL.

1276
01:08:05,481 --> 01:08:07,749
I guess the adrenaline
is pumping and stuff,

1277

feel it that much

it started hurting really bad.

1279

to the bishop about

everything to him

[Cheering and applause]

1420

This elder's gonna
take him up

1421
01:16:27,349 --> 01:16:28,883
and check him in
and help him get

so if you want to

give him a big--
one last hug...

1424

OK.

for sharing him.

Thank you.

1427
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:39,093
He looks like
he's gonna love it.

Fihi:
I'll phone you, Mom.

1429
01:16:40,562 --> 01:16:41,896
Bye!
Bye! Love you guys!

1430
01:16:41,964 --> 01:16:42,897
I love you.

1431

Man: Watch out,
Dallas, Texas.

1432
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:46,300
Don't worry.

1433
01:16:46,368 --> 01:16:47,301
Man: Thank you.

01:16:47,369 --> 01:16:49,604

Thanks, man.

We'll take care of him!

See you guys.

Harvey, voice-over:
"Is Langi ready?

1439
01:17:10,525 --> 01:17:13,094
"Like, is he--is he
even ready for college?

1440
01:17:13,161 --> 01:17:15,396
Was--college came
too early for him?"

1441
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:18,099
Right after I
read that, dude,

1442
01:17:18,166 --> 01:17:19,634
I put that thing
on my locker--

1443
01:17:19,701 --> 01:17:21,836
my locker and just
went to town.

1444
01:17:21,903 --> 01:17:23,204
Hey, way to make
a play!

1445
01:17:23,271 --> 01:17:25,206
You didn't know
where to go anyway.

1446
01:17:25,273 --> 01:17:26,440
You have no idea
where to go.

1447
01:17:26,508 --> 01:17:27,441
I have no checks.

1448
01:17:27,509 --> 01:17:28,776
Right.

1449
01:17:36,118 --> 01:17:38,452
Newsman: Harvey Langi is leaving
the University of Utah

1450
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:41,722
football team to go
on a two-year LDS mission.

1451
01:17:41,790 --> 01:17:43,791
He came into Utah
out of Bingham High

1452
01:17:43,859 --> 01:17:46,961
as one of the highest recruited
players in state history.

1453
01:17:47,029 --> 01:17:48,863
He barely played
at all last year.

1454
01:17:48,930 --> 01:17:51,165
Perhaps Langi saw this
as a good time

1455
01:17:51,233 --> 01:17:53,467
to serve a mission.

1456
01:18:06,014 --> 01:18:09,950
Exciting. Very exciting.

1457
01:18:10,018 --> 01:18:16,290
Let go of the things
he loved the most.

1458
01:18:16,358 --> 01:18:21,095
He loved to play football.
Loved school and loved Utah.

1459
01:18:21,163 --> 01:18:25,966
He can leave it behind--
his coaches...

1460
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:29,537
his...friends,

1461
01:18:29,604 --> 01:18:35,176
girlfriends, Mom and Dad,
brothers and sisters, and...

1462
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:40,514
oh, my gosh.

01:18:40,582 --> 01:18:41,515
Harvey: Mom.

Kalasita: Uh-huh?

1465
01:18:42,651 --> 01:18:44,418
I'm trying to hurry up
and make this quick

1466
01:18:44,486 --> 01:18:46,554
so we can go to
the carnival after.

1467
01:18:46,621 --> 01:18:49,123
OK, then you need
to go and get ready.

1468
01:18:49,191 --> 01:18:52,593
I'm not getting ready
to open up my call, Mom.

1469
01:18:52,661 --> 01:18:54,095
I'm not wearing
a buttoned-up shirt

1470
01:18:54,162 --> 01:18:57,231
to open up
a piece of paper.

1471
01:18:57,299 --> 01:19:01,235
So, just do what
Mom asks you to do.

1472
01:19:01,303 --> 01:19:03,738
I'll put on some socks,
and that's it.

1473
01:19:03,805 --> 01:19:06,307
Kalasita: Go and put on
church clothes.

1474
01:19:06,374 --> 01:19:07,975
I'm not showering, either.

1475
01:19:08,043 --> 01:19:10,611
Kalasita: No, son.
Stop it.

1476
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:13,214
Sorry we're so late.

1477
01:19:13,281 --> 01:19:14,115
We could not
find your house.

1478
01:19:14,182 --> 01:19:15,716
It's OK.

1479
01:19:15,784 --> 01:19:17,218
How are you?
Good.

1480
01:19:17,285 --> 01:19:18,219
Are you excited?

1481
01:19:18,286 --> 01:19:19,220
Yeah.

Harvey: A lot of people think
I'm just doing my mission

1484
01:19:25,727 --> 01:19:27,962
because maybe I'm scared
of football

1485
01:19:28,029 --> 01:19:31,532
or scared of not playing
because I didn't do good

1486
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,901
my first year.

I'm not scared.

01:19:38,273 --> 01:19:41,342
I can still play ball.

1490
01:19:41,409 --> 01:19:42,543
I'm gonna be a running back.

1491
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:44,612
I'm gonna show that Polys
can be a running back

1492
01:19:44,679 --> 01:19:48,149
in the League, and--and I know
I have the ability to do it.

an older brother

1497
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:22,483
is a huge role in my family.

1498
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:27,421
My dad always told me,
"Whatever you do,

your little brother's
gonna do."

That's why I was
so mad at myself.

that, like the gun thing
