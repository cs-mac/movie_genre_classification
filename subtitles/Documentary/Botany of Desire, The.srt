1
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,467
Can I help you?

2
00:02:10,602 --> 00:02:14,129
They told me to take a
streetcar named Desire...

3
00:02:14,339 --> 00:02:16,864
...then transfer to one
called Cemeteries...

4
00:02:17,109 --> 00:02:19,703
...ride 6 blocks and get
off at Elysian Fields.

5
00:02:21,179 --> 00:02:22,305
There's your car.

6
00:02:33,258 --> 00:02:34,316
Thanks.

7
00:03:12,664 --> 00:03:14,529
When he got home, she was waiting.

8
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,427
You never heard nothing...

9
00:03:23,575 --> 00:03:25,440
What's wrong? You lost?

10
00:03:25,677 --> 00:03:27,645
I'm looking for Elysian Fields.

11
00:03:27,813 --> 00:03:30,213
This is Elysian Fields. What number?

12
00:03:30,749 --> 00:03:32,444
642.

13
00:03:32,684 --> 00:03:34,709
Don't need to look no further.

14
00:03:35,187 --> 00:03:39,886
I'm looking for my sister, Stella
DuBois, I mean, Mrs. Stanley Kowalski.

15
00:03:40,092 --> 00:03:43,960
That's the party, all right.
You just did miss her, though.

16
00:03:44,763 --> 00:03:45,957
This...

17
00:03:47,432 --> 00:03:49,297
Can this be her home?

18
00:03:49,501 --> 00:03:51,731
She lives downstairs, I live up.

19
00:03:51,937 --> 00:03:53,734
She's out?

20
00:03:54,106 --> 00:03:56,574
You notice the bowling alley?

21
00:03:56,775 --> 00:03:59,175
- I'm not sure I did.
- That's where she's at.

22
00:03:59,344 --> 00:04:00,971
She's watching Stanley bowl.

23
00:04:11,623 --> 00:04:12,920
Blanche!

24
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,756
Stella!

25
00:04:19,965 --> 00:04:21,933
Oh, Stella for a star!

26
00:04:22,234 --> 00:04:24,930
My darling. Now, then,
let me look at you.

27
00:04:25,137 --> 00:04:28,504
But don't look at me. I won't
be looked at in this glare.

28
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,436
- Did you find our place?
- What're you doing in a place like that?

29
00:04:31,643 --> 00:04:34,703
Never, never in my worst
dreams did I picture...

30
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,281
Only Poe, Mr. Edgar Allan Poe,
could do justice to it!

31
00:04:38,483 --> 00:04:42,783
What are you doing in that horrible
place? I didn't mean to say that.

32
00:04:42,988 --> 00:04:46,219
I meant to be nice and say,
"What a convenient location!"

33
00:04:46,391 --> 00:04:49,224
- You haven't said a word to me.
- I haven't had a chance.

34
00:04:49,394 --> 00:04:51,624
Now open your pretty mouth and talk.

35
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:54,526
- Come say hello to Stanley first.
- No, not now.

36
00:04:54,766 --> 00:04:55,733
Just say hello.

37
00:04:55,901 --> 00:04:58,961
Which is he? Which one is he?

38
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:05,737
Is he the one...

39
00:05:05,911 --> 00:05:08,038
The one making all the rhubarb!

40
00:05:08,346 --> 00:05:10,314
Isn't he wonderful-Iooking?

41
00:05:16,154 --> 00:05:19,646
I can't meet him now.
Not till I've bathed and rested.

42
00:05:19,858 --> 00:05:23,385
- Would you like a cold drink?
- Bless that lovely inspiration.

43
00:05:27,866 --> 00:05:29,561
Oh, baby.

44
00:05:31,603 --> 00:05:33,264
Would you like some pop?

45
00:05:33,438 --> 00:05:35,065
Honey! Pop!

46
00:05:35,307 --> 00:05:38,003
Not with my nerves tonight.
A scotch please.

47
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,677
Grape.

48
00:05:39,878 --> 00:05:43,279
You haven't asked me how I happened
to get away from school...

49
00:05:43,448 --> 00:05:45,006
...before the term ended.

50
00:05:45,217 --> 00:05:47,845
Thought you'd tell me if you wanted to.

51
00:05:48,053 --> 00:05:50,283
You thought I'd been fired?

52
00:05:50,455 --> 00:05:53,356
No! I thought you might have resigned.

53
00:05:53,558 --> 00:05:57,790
I was so exhausted by all I'd
been through, my nerves broke.

54
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,928
I was on the verge of lunacy, almost.

55
00:06:02,133 --> 00:06:05,193
So Mr. Graves... He's the
high school superintendent...

56
00:06:05,403 --> 00:06:07,371
Thank you. He suggested...

57
00:06:08,907 --> 00:06:10,431
...I take a leave of absence.

58
00:06:10,642 --> 00:06:14,874
I couldn't put all those details
into the wire. This feels so good.

59
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,377
Like another?

60
00:06:16,848 --> 00:06:20,113
One's my limit. You haven't
said a word about my appearance.

61
00:06:20,352 --> 00:06:21,614
You look fine.

62
00:06:21,853 --> 00:06:25,880
God love you for a liar.
Daylight never exposed so total a ruin.

63
00:06:26,091 --> 00:06:30,323
But you've put on some weight.
You're as plump as a partridge.

64
00:06:30,495 --> 00:06:32,326
It's so becoming to you.

65
00:06:32,597 --> 00:06:35,065
Yes, it is! Or I wouldn't say it!

66
00:06:35,267 --> 00:06:38,065
You just have to watch
around the hips a little.

67
00:06:38,436 --> 00:06:42,566
I wanted you to look at my figure.
I haven't put on one ounce in 10 years.

68
00:06:42,774 --> 00:06:45,743
I weigh now what I weighed the
summer you left Belle Reve...

69
00:06:45,944 --> 00:06:49,243
...the summer Dad died and you left us.

70
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,419
It's just incredible,
Blanche, how well you look.

71
00:07:01,526 --> 00:07:03,255
Sure you don't want another?

72
00:07:03,628 --> 00:07:07,428
Maybe I will take just
one tiny nip more...

73
00:07:07,632 --> 00:07:09,259
...to put the stopper on.

74
00:07:09,467 --> 00:07:12,095
Don't worry, your sister's not a drunk.

75
00:07:12,304 --> 00:07:17,173
She's just all shaken up
and hot and dirty and tired.

76
00:07:18,209 --> 00:07:19,369
Waiter!

77
00:07:20,045 --> 00:07:21,239
Waiter!

78
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,617
You want it hot?

79
00:07:26,818 --> 00:07:28,012
Scalding.

80
00:07:32,557 --> 00:07:33,888
What is it?

81
00:07:34,059 --> 00:07:37,119
There's only two rooms.
Where will you put me?

82
00:07:37,329 --> 00:07:39,194
We'll put you right here.

83
00:07:39,431 --> 00:07:43,128
What kind of a bed's this?
One of those collapsible things?

84
00:07:43,335 --> 00:07:44,461
You all right?

85
00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:47,797
Wonderful, honey. I don't
like a bed that gives much.

86
00:07:48,006 --> 00:07:51,965
There's no door between the two rooms.
Will it be decent?

87
00:07:52,177 --> 00:07:54,543
Stanley's Polish, you know.

88
00:07:54,746 --> 00:07:56,646
Something like Irish, isn't it?

89
00:07:56,848 --> 00:07:57,906
Well...

90
00:07:58,683 --> 00:08:02,050
I bought some nice clothes to
meet all your lovely friends in.

91
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,921
Well, I'm afraid you won't
think they're lovely.

92
00:08:06,091 --> 00:08:08,821
I bought nice clothes
and I'll wear them.

93
00:08:10,028 --> 00:08:12,826
I guess you're hoping I'll
say I'll put up at a hotel.

94
00:08:13,031 --> 00:08:14,828
But I'm not going to.

95
00:08:15,033 --> 00:08:19,561
I must be near you. I must be
with people. I can't be alone...

96
00:08:20,205 --> 00:08:22,332
...because, as you must have noticed...

97
00:08:22,607 --> 00:08:24,575
...I'm not very well.

98
00:08:25,477 --> 00:08:26,739
You do seem...

99
00:08:28,113 --> 00:08:31,844
Will Stanley like me or will
I just be a visiting in-law?

100
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:33,347
I couldn't stand that.

101
00:08:33,718 --> 00:08:37,347
You'll get along fine.
Try not to compare him...

102
00:08:37,555 --> 00:08:38,749
He was an officer?

103
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:42,756
He was a master sergeant,
decorated 4 times.

104
00:08:42,994 --> 00:08:47,522
- He had those on when you met him?
- I wasn't just blinded by the brass.

105
00:08:47,732 --> 00:08:48,699
I wasn't...

106
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,768
There were things to
adjust myself to later on.

107
00:08:53,138 --> 00:08:55,971
Such as his... civilian background?

108
00:08:56,408 --> 00:08:58,467
How'd he take the news I was coming?

109
00:08:58,643 --> 00:09:01,771
- He's on the road a good deal.
- Oh, he travels?

110
00:09:02,013 --> 00:09:04,106
Good. I mean, isn't it?

111
00:09:04,315 --> 00:09:07,478
I can hardly stand it when
he's away for a night.

112
00:09:08,653 --> 00:09:11,781
- Lf he's away for a week, I go wild.
- Gracious!

113
00:09:12,023 --> 00:09:15,982
When he comes back, cry
on his lap like a baby.

114
00:09:17,762 --> 00:09:20,492
I guess that's what's
meant by being in love.

115
00:09:28,173 --> 00:09:31,802
I haven't asked the things you
probably thought I would...

116
00:09:32,043 --> 00:09:36,639
...so I expect you to be understanding
about what I have to tell you.

117
00:09:36,848 --> 00:09:38,008
What?

118
00:09:38,183 --> 00:09:42,813
You're going to reproach me. I know
you're bound to, but before you do...

119
00:09:43,054 --> 00:09:46,251
...consider the fact that you left.
I stayed and struggled.

120
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:51,259
You came to New Orleans. I stayed at
Belle Reve trying to hold it together.

121
00:09:51,463 --> 00:09:53,931
I'm not meaning to reproach you...

122
00:09:54,132 --> 00:09:56,430
...but all the burden descended on me!

123
00:09:56,634 --> 00:09:58,158
It was best I came here.

124
00:09:58,369 --> 00:10:03,102
But you abandoned Belle Reve, not I.
I stayed and almost died for it!

125
00:10:03,308 --> 00:10:06,766
- Tell me what happened!
- I knew you'd take this attitude!

126
00:10:06,978 --> 00:10:09,276
About what? Please!

127
00:10:10,582 --> 00:10:11,947
The loss.

128
00:10:13,985 --> 00:10:14,952
The loss.

129
00:10:16,654 --> 00:10:18,952
Belle Reve? Lost, is it?

130
00:10:21,493 --> 00:10:22,619
Yes.

131
00:10:23,495 --> 00:10:26,293
But how did it go? What happened?

132
00:10:26,598 --> 00:10:29,567
You're a fine one to ask me how it went!

133
00:10:29,734 --> 00:10:33,363
To stand there accusing me of it!
I won't stand it!

134
00:10:41,112 --> 00:10:45,208
I! I took the blows on
my face and my body!

135
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:49,648
All of those deaths!
The long parade to the graveyard.

136
00:10:49,854 --> 00:10:51,481
Father, Mother...

137
00:10:51,756 --> 00:10:54,088
...Margaret, that dreadful way.

138
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:56,591
You just came home for the funerals.

139
00:10:56,761 --> 00:10:59,491
And funerals are pretty
compared to deaths.

140
00:10:59,697 --> 00:11:03,098
How'd you think all that
dying was paid for?

141
00:11:03,268 --> 00:11:05,395
Death is expensive, Miss Stella.

142
00:11:05,637 --> 00:11:08,902
And l, from my pitiful
salary at the school.

143
00:11:09,641 --> 00:11:11,233
Yes, accuse me.

144
00:11:11,442 --> 00:11:14,104
Stare at me, thinking
I let the place go!

145
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:18,010
I let the place go! Where were you?
In there with your Polack!

146
00:11:18,216 --> 00:11:19,683
That's enough!

147
00:11:19,884 --> 00:11:21,909
Oh, Stella, Stella, you're crying!

148
00:11:22,153 --> 00:11:23,745
Does that surprise you?

149
00:11:26,057 --> 00:11:27,854
We playing at your house?

150
00:11:28,059 --> 00:11:30,118
No, my mother's still sick.

151
00:11:30,295 --> 00:11:32,763
- You bring the beer.
- Break it up down there.

152
00:11:32,964 --> 00:11:36,525
- I made spaghetti and ate it myself!
- Now, honey...

153
00:11:36,734 --> 00:11:38,702
...told you we were playing.

154
00:11:40,672 --> 00:11:42,867
You never phoned me once.

155
00:11:43,074 --> 00:11:46,373
- I told you at breakfast.
- Why don't you just get in here.

156
00:11:46,578 --> 00:11:48,705
Do you want it in the newspapers?

157
00:12:07,498 --> 00:12:09,159
You must be Stanley.

158
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,660
I'm Blanche.

159
00:12:11,703 --> 00:12:13,398
You're Stel's sister.

160
00:12:14,205 --> 00:12:15,172
Yes.

161
00:12:15,707 --> 00:12:16,901
Hi ya.

162
00:12:17,275 --> 00:12:18,902
Where's the little woman?

163
00:12:20,345 --> 00:12:21,812
In the bathroom.

164
00:12:25,016 --> 00:12:27,177
Where you from, Blanche?

165
00:12:27,352 --> 00:12:29,684
I live in Auriol.

166
00:12:30,021 --> 00:12:31,318
Auriol.

167
00:12:32,457 --> 00:12:35,585
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Auriol, that's not my territory.

168
00:12:36,628 --> 00:12:39,096
Liquor goes fast in the hot weather.

169
00:12:39,731 --> 00:12:40,755
Want a shot?

170
00:12:40,965 --> 00:12:42,933
No, I rarely touch it.

171
00:12:43,801 --> 00:12:47,999
There's some people that rarely
touch it, but it touches them often.

172
00:12:52,644 --> 00:12:54,942
You mind if I make myself comfortable?

173
00:12:55,146 --> 00:12:56,773
Please do.

174
00:12:57,248 --> 00:12:59,614
" Be comfortable," that's my motto.

175
00:12:59,817 --> 00:13:03,275
Mine too. It's hard to stay
looking fresh in hot weather.

176
00:13:03,488 --> 00:13:06,013
I haven't washed or even powdered and...

177
00:13:06,257 --> 00:13:07,952
...here you are.

178
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:12,289
You must be careful sitting
in damp things. Catch cold.

179
00:13:12,563 --> 00:13:15,361
Especially when you been
exercising hard, like bowling.

180
00:13:17,168 --> 00:13:19,466
What do you do? You're a teacher?

181
00:13:19,671 --> 00:13:20,365
Yes.

182
00:13:20,571 --> 00:13:21,538
What subject?

183
00:13:22,273 --> 00:13:23,535
English.

184
00:13:24,175 --> 00:13:26,541
I never was a very good English student.

185
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:31,146
- How long you here for?
- I don't know yet.

186
00:13:31,683 --> 00:13:33,150
Shacking up here?

187
00:13:34,085 --> 00:13:37,145
I will if it's not inconvenient for you.

188
00:13:38,022 --> 00:13:39,046
Good.

189
00:13:42,694 --> 00:13:44,559
Traveling wears me out.

190
00:13:45,363 --> 00:13:46,830
Take it easy.

191
00:13:47,031 --> 00:13:48,055
What's that?

192
00:13:50,535 --> 00:13:52,059
Those cats.

193
00:13:58,876 --> 00:14:01,344
What'd you do, fall asleep in there?

194
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:08,849
I guess I'll strike you as
being the unrefined type.

195
00:14:10,888 --> 00:14:14,016
Stella's spoke a good deal about you.

196
00:14:15,626 --> 00:14:17,787
She said you were married once.

197
00:14:18,229 --> 00:14:20,288
Said you were married once.

198
00:14:20,465 --> 00:14:22,695
Said you were married once.

199
00:14:23,134 --> 00:14:24,192
Yes.

200
00:14:25,403 --> 00:14:27,030
When I was quite young.

201
00:14:27,405 --> 00:14:28,872
What happened?

202
00:14:29,073 --> 00:14:30,199
What happened?

203
00:14:30,408 --> 00:14:31,375
The boy...

204
00:14:32,477 --> 00:14:33,944
The boy died.

205
00:14:50,595 --> 00:14:52,062
I'm afraid...

206
00:14:53,431 --> 00:14:55,228
...I'm going to be sick.

207
00:14:57,735 --> 00:14:59,293
Fresh fish!

208
00:15:00,505 --> 00:15:01,472
Fish!

209
00:15:01,672 --> 00:15:03,367
Fresh fish!

210
00:15:13,918 --> 00:15:16,478
Looks like she's fixing to stay awhile.

211
00:15:16,687 --> 00:15:18,382
So, we playing tonight?

212
00:15:18,689 --> 00:15:20,054
Maybe we ought to...

213
00:15:20,258 --> 00:15:22,226
Don't figure no maybes.

214
00:15:22,427 --> 00:15:23,894
- Put it down.
- Right.

215
00:15:24,195 --> 00:15:25,890
Shall I get the other one?

216
00:15:26,597 --> 00:15:28,224
Thanks, darling.

217
00:15:29,267 --> 00:15:31,167
Is Stanley back with my trunk?

218
00:15:31,369 --> 00:15:32,336
Yes.

219
00:15:32,537 --> 00:15:35,165
Honey? Will you get my blue net for me?

220
00:15:35,373 --> 00:15:36,738
All right.

221
00:15:36,941 --> 00:15:39,409
It was good of Stanley to get my trunk.

222
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,578
He was glad to do it.

223
00:15:41,946 --> 00:15:44,414
- I'll see you later.
- Just don't forget.

224
00:15:44,615 --> 00:15:48,016
I'm taking Blanche to Galatoire's
for supper, then to a show...

225
00:15:48,219 --> 00:15:49,914
...because it's poker night.

226
00:15:50,221 --> 00:15:52,849
How about my supper?
I'm not going to Galatoire's.

227
00:15:53,057 --> 00:15:55,355
I put you a cold plate on ice.

228
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:59,587
We'll be back after the party's over
as I'm not sure how'll she'll take it.

229
00:15:59,797 --> 00:16:01,264
Isn't that just dandy.

230
00:16:01,566 --> 00:16:03,431
You better give me some money.

231
00:16:03,734 --> 00:16:05,031
Where is she?

232
00:16:05,236 --> 00:16:10,037
She's soaking in a hot tub to quiet
her nerves. She's terribly upset.

233
00:16:10,241 --> 00:16:11,538
Over what?

234
00:16:11,742 --> 00:16:14,711
She's been through an ordeal.
We lost Belle Reve.

235
00:16:15,646 --> 00:16:17,944
What, the place in the country?

236
00:16:18,249 --> 00:16:19,113
How?

237
00:16:19,317 --> 00:16:21,114
It had to be sacrificed.

238
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:24,880
When she comes in, say something
nice about her appearance.

239
00:16:25,089 --> 00:16:26,386
And...

240
00:16:26,591 --> 00:16:27,956
...don't mention the baby.

241
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:31,458
I haven't told her.
I'm waiting till she calms down.

242
00:16:31,662 --> 00:16:35,393
And try to understand her
and be nice to her, honey.

243
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,125
She wasn't expecting such a place.

244
00:16:38,336 --> 00:16:41,396
I tried to gloss things over
a little in my letters.

245
00:16:41,606 --> 00:16:44,803
Admire her dress.
Tell her she looks wonderful.

246
00:16:45,009 --> 00:16:47,739
It's important to Blanche,
her little weakness.

247
00:16:47,945 --> 00:16:50,243
Okay, I get the idea, but...

248
00:16:50,615 --> 00:16:54,642
...let's just skip back to where
you said the place was disposed of.

249
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,418
How about a few more
details on that subject.

250
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:02,320
It's best not to talk about
it until she's calmed down.

251
00:17:02,693 --> 00:17:06,754
Is that the deal? Blanche can't
be annoyed with details right now?

252
00:17:07,031 --> 00:17:09,261
You saw how she was last night.

253
00:17:09,467 --> 00:17:12,664
I saw how she was. Now,
let's see the bill of sale.

254
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:14,428
I haven't seen any.

255
00:17:15,139 --> 00:17:18,165
She didn't show you no papers,
no deed nor nothing?

256
00:17:18,376 --> 00:17:20,344
It seemed like it wasn't sold.

257
00:17:20,878 --> 00:17:22,675
Was it given away to charity?

258
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,010
- She'll hear you.
- I don't care. Let's see the papers.

259
00:17:27,218 --> 00:17:32,121
There weren't any. She didn't show
any papers. I don't care about papers.

260
00:17:32,323 --> 00:17:35,952
Wait, listen. Have you
heard of the Napoleonic code?

261
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,129
No, I haven't heard of
the Napoleonic code.

262
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:41,958
Let me enlighten you on a point or two.

263
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:46,292
We got here in Louisiana what's
known as the Napoleonic Code:

264
00:17:46,504 --> 00:17:51,203
That what belongs to the wife, belongs
to the husband, and vice versa.

265
00:17:51,409 --> 00:17:53,036
Will you listen?

266
00:17:53,244 --> 00:17:55,303
For example, if I had that property...

267
00:17:55,513 --> 00:17:57,640
My head is swimming.

268
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,051
Well, all right, then.

269
00:18:03,688 --> 00:18:05,986
When she's done soaking in the tub...

270
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:09,648
...I'll inquire if she
is acquainted with it.

271
00:18:10,094 --> 00:18:12,062
Stanley! Don't be so silly!

272
00:18:12,263 --> 00:18:14,231
It looks like you were swindled.

273
00:18:14,432 --> 00:18:19,062
And, under the Napoleonic Code, I
got swindled too. I don't like that.

274
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:23,238
You've no idea how
ridiculous you're being...

275
00:18:23,441 --> 00:18:25,739
...when you suggest my sister, or...

276
00:18:25,943 --> 00:18:28,844
...anyone else of our family,
could have swindled anyone...

277
00:18:29,046 --> 00:18:32,174
Come on, where's the money
if the place was sold?

278
00:18:32,383 --> 00:18:34,851
Not sold! Lost! Lost!

279
00:18:35,453 --> 00:18:36,579
Come here.

280
00:18:36,954 --> 00:18:41,357
Open your eyes to this stuff here?
She got this out of a teacher's pay?

281
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:42,856
Oh, hush!

282
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:46,757
Look at these fine feathers and
furs that she preens herself in.

283
00:18:46,964 --> 00:18:49,933
What is this article?
A solid-gold dress!

284
00:18:50,901 --> 00:18:53,597
And this one here.
And what is that, a fox-piece?

285
00:18:53,804 --> 00:18:58,537
A genuine fur-fox, a half a mile long!
Where are your fox-pieces?

286
00:18:58,976 --> 00:19:02,207
Bushy, snow-white ones, no less!
Where are your white fox furs?

287
00:19:02,413 --> 00:19:06,281
Those are inexpensive furs
Blanche has had a long time.

288
00:19:06,484 --> 00:19:10,887
An acquaintance deals in these items
and he's going to appraise this.

289
00:19:11,088 --> 00:19:12,715
Don't be an idiot!

290
00:19:12,923 --> 00:19:16,791
I'll bet you there's $1000 invested in this stuff.

291
00:19:17,261 --> 00:19:20,230
Now, is that the treasure
chest of a pirate?

292
00:19:20,931 --> 00:19:23,229
That's pearls. Ropes of them.

293
00:19:24,101 --> 00:19:26,569
Is your sister a deep-sea diver?

294
00:19:26,771 --> 00:19:29,239
Where're your pearls and gold bracelets?

295
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,237
Be still.

296
00:19:31,442 --> 00:19:33,410
A diamond crown for an empress.

297
00:19:33,611 --> 00:19:37,308
A rhinestone tiara she
wore to a costume ball.

298
00:19:37,515 --> 00:19:38,812
What is rhinestone?

299
00:19:39,016 --> 00:19:40,916
Next door to glass.

300
00:19:41,619 --> 00:19:46,488
An acquaintance works in a jewelry store.
He'll come to make an appraisal.

301
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:49,323
Here's your plantation.

302
00:19:49,527 --> 00:19:51,995
You're being stupid and horrid!

303
00:19:52,196 --> 00:19:55,427
You stay away from these
things before she comes out!

304
00:19:55,633 --> 00:19:58,329
The Kowalskis and DuBois got
a different notion on this.

305
00:19:58,536 --> 00:20:02,267
Indeed they have, thank heavens.
I'm going outside.

306
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,164
Go ahead.

307
00:20:07,211 --> 00:20:10,112
Come out with me while
Blanche is getting dressed.

308
00:20:10,381 --> 00:20:12,941
Since when are you giving me orders?

309
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:16,119
Are you going to stay
here and insult her?

310
00:20:16,387 --> 00:20:18,355
You bet your life I'm staying.

311
00:20:35,172 --> 00:20:36,298
Hello, Stanley.

312
00:20:38,175 --> 00:20:42,475
Here I am, freshly bathed and scented
and feeling like a new person.

313
00:20:42,747 --> 00:20:44,146
That's good.

314
00:20:44,849 --> 00:20:49,149
Will you excuse me while I
put on my pretty new dress?

315
00:20:49,754 --> 00:20:50,812
Go ahead.

316
00:21:26,457 --> 00:21:29,517
I understand there's to be
a card party here tonight...

317
00:21:29,727 --> 00:21:32,594
...to which we ladies are
cordially not invited.

318
00:21:33,063 --> 00:21:34,360
That's right.

319
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,267
Where is Stella?

320
00:21:38,135 --> 00:21:40,194
She's out on the porch.

321
00:21:47,244 --> 00:21:49,542
I'm going to ask a favor of you soon.

322
00:21:51,081 --> 00:21:53,106
What's that going to be, I wonder?

323
00:21:53,818 --> 00:21:55,615
Some buttons in back.

324
00:21:56,821 --> 00:21:58,288
You may enter.

325
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:03,556
How do I look?

326
00:22:03,828 --> 00:22:05,227
You look okay.

327
00:22:05,429 --> 00:22:07,954
Many thanks. Now, the buttons.

328
00:22:13,337 --> 00:22:15,237
I can't do no more with them.

329
00:22:15,606 --> 00:22:17,574
You men with your big, clumsy fingers.

330
00:22:17,775 --> 00:22:19,470
May I have a drag?

331
00:22:19,677 --> 00:22:22,077
- Have one for yourself.
- Thank you.

332
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:25,407
It looks like my trunk has exploded.

333
00:22:25,783 --> 00:22:27,808
Me and Stella helped you unpack.

334
00:22:29,019 --> 00:22:31,579
You did a fast and thorough job of it.

335
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:35,156
It looks like you've raided
some stylish shops in Paris.

336
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:37,156
Clothes are my passion.

337
00:22:37,361 --> 00:22:39,420
How much do furs like that cost?

338
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:41,825
These were a tribute from an admirer.

339
00:22:42,032 --> 00:22:43,761
He had a lot of admiration.

340
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:46,766
In my youth I excited some
admiration, but look at me now.

341
00:22:47,137 --> 00:22:50,766
Will you think it's possible that
I was once considered attractive?

342
00:22:52,142 --> 00:22:53,609
Your looks are okay.

343
00:22:53,978 --> 00:22:56,674
- I was fishing for a compliment.
- I don't go in for that.

344
00:22:56,881 --> 00:22:59,008
- What?
- Compliments to women on their looks.

345
00:22:59,216 --> 00:23:02,515
Every dame knows if she's good
looking without being told.

346
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:06,278
Some give themselves credit
for more than they've got.

347
00:23:06,657 --> 00:23:09,683
I once went out with a dame who
said, "I'm the glamorous type."

348
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,858
She says, "I'm the glamorous type."
I says, "So what?"

349
00:23:13,063 --> 00:23:15,031
What did she say then?

350
00:23:15,232 --> 00:23:17,200
Nothing. It shut her up.

351
00:23:17,401 --> 00:23:19,130
Did it end the romance?

352
00:23:19,336 --> 00:23:21,964
It ended the conversation.
That was all.

353
00:23:22,406 --> 00:23:26,809
Some men are took in by this Hollywood
glamour stuff, and some men just aren't.

354
00:23:27,011 --> 00:23:29,707
- And you're in the 2nd category.
- That's right.

355
00:23:29,914 --> 00:23:33,714
- I can't imagine a woman bewitching you.
- That's right.

356
00:23:33,918 --> 00:23:37,979
You're simple, straightforward
and honest. A bit on the...

357
00:23:38,188 --> 00:23:40,986
...primitive side. To interest
you a woman would have to...

358
00:23:41,191 --> 00:23:43,159
She must lay the cards on the table.

359
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,988
I never did care for wishy-washy people.

360
00:23:46,196 --> 00:23:48,824
When I saw you last
night I said to myself:

361
00:23:49,033 --> 00:23:52,332
"My sister has married a man."
That was all I could tell...

362
00:23:52,536 --> 00:23:54,834
How about cutting the re-bop?!

363
00:23:57,374 --> 00:23:59,569
Come with me while Blanche dresses.

364
00:23:59,777 --> 00:24:01,176
- I'm done.
- Come out.

365
00:24:01,378 --> 00:24:03,903
- Your sister and I are chatting.
- Do me a favor.

366
00:24:04,114 --> 00:24:07,015
Go to the store and get me a
lemon coke with chipped ice.

367
00:24:07,217 --> 00:24:09,913
Will you do that for me, sweetie?
Please?

368
00:24:11,789 --> 00:24:13,017
All right.

369
00:24:18,629 --> 00:24:20,597
The poor thing was listening to us.

370
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:24,359
I have an idea she doesn't
understand you as well as I do.

371
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:29,531
All right, let us proceed
without any more digression.

372
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:34,609
I'm ready to answer all questions.
I've nothing to hide. What is it?

373
00:24:36,313 --> 00:24:40,943
In the state of Louisiana we've got
what's known as the Napoleonic Code.

374
00:24:41,318 --> 00:24:45,379
According to which that what belongs
to the wife belongs to her husband.

375
00:24:45,589 --> 00:24:47,955
You have an impressive judicial air.

376
00:24:48,158 --> 00:24:52,060
If you weren't my wife's sister,
I'd get ideas about you.

377
00:24:53,998 --> 00:24:54,896
Such as what?

378
00:24:55,499 --> 00:24:57,797
Don't play so dumb. You know what.

379
00:24:59,336 --> 00:25:00,462
All right.

380
00:25:00,771 --> 00:25:02,238
Cards on the table.

381
00:25:02,439 --> 00:25:07,069
I know I fib a good deal.
But a woman's charm is 50º% º illusion.

382
00:25:08,779 --> 00:25:11,748
But when a thing is important,
I tell the truth.

383
00:25:11,949 --> 00:25:13,416
This is the truth:

384
00:25:13,617 --> 00:25:15,141
I never cheated my sister...

385
00:25:15,352 --> 00:25:18,810
...or you, or anyone else on
earth as long as I lived!

386
00:25:19,023 --> 00:25:20,581
Where are the papers?

387
00:25:20,791 --> 00:25:23,089
Everything I own is in that trunk.

388
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:29,759
What are you thinking? What's in
that little boy's mind of yours?

389
00:25:29,967 --> 00:25:32,333
I'll do it, it'll be faster and simpler.

390
00:25:32,536 --> 00:25:34,834
I keep my papers in this tin box.

391
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,597
What are those underneath?

392
00:25:39,209 --> 00:25:40,767
Some love letters...

393
00:25:41,311 --> 00:25:43,336
...yellowing with antiquity.

394
00:25:43,814 --> 00:25:46,783
- All from one boy. Give them to me!
- I'll just look.

395
00:25:46,984 --> 00:25:49,953
- Your touch insults them.
- Don't pull that stuff!

396
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,949
Now that you've touched
them, I'll burn them!

397
00:25:54,224 --> 00:25:56,124
What are they?

398
00:25:57,828 --> 00:26:00,456
Poems... the dead boy wrote.

399
00:26:01,065 --> 00:26:05,024
I hurt him the way that you would
like to hurt me, but you can't.

400
00:26:05,235 --> 00:26:09,797
I'm no longer young and vulnerable.
My young husband was and I...

401
00:26:11,241 --> 00:26:12,868
Never mind about that.

402
00:26:14,344 --> 00:26:15,971
Give them back to me.

403
00:26:21,852 --> 00:26:24,320
What'd you mean, you have to burn them?

404
00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:26,488
I'm sorry.

405
00:26:27,691 --> 00:26:30,057
I must have lost my head for a moment.

406
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:34,160
Everyone has something they
won't let others touch...

407
00:26:34,765 --> 00:26:36,824
...because of their intimate nature.

408
00:26:43,874 --> 00:26:45,501
Ambler and Ambler!

409
00:26:45,876 --> 00:26:47,343
Crabtree!

410
00:26:48,545 --> 00:26:49,671
Ambler and Ambler!

411
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,849
- What's Ambler and Ambler?
- A firm that made loans on the place.

412
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:55,746
- It was lost on a mortgage?
- It must have been.

413
00:26:55,953 --> 00:26:58,751
I don't want no ifs, ands, or buts!
Where's the rest?

414
00:26:58,956 --> 00:27:03,757
Thousands of papers, stretching back
over centuries, affect Belle Reve.

415
00:27:03,961 --> 00:27:08,091
As piece by piece our improvident
grandfathers exchanged the land...

416
00:27:08,298 --> 00:27:11,028
...for their epic debauches,
to put it mildly.

417
00:27:11,235 --> 00:27:14,261
Finally all that was left,
and Stella can verify it...

418
00:27:14,471 --> 00:27:19,204
...was the house itself, and 20 acres
of ground including a graveyard...

419
00:27:19,576 --> 00:27:23,706
...to which now all but
Stella and I have retreated.

420
00:27:24,148 --> 00:27:25,945
Here they are, all of them.

421
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,276
All papers.

422
00:27:27,484 --> 00:27:31,386
I hereby endow you with them.
Peruse them, commit them to memory.

423
00:27:31,588 --> 00:27:33,954
It's wonderfully fitting
that Belle Reve...

424
00:27:34,158 --> 00:27:38,060
...should be this bunch of
papers in big, capable hands.

425
00:27:41,165 --> 00:27:43,633
I wonder if Stella's back with my coke?

426
00:27:45,269 --> 00:27:48,238
I got a lawyer acquaintance,
we'll straighten this out.

427
00:27:48,939 --> 00:27:52,397
Present them to him with
a box of aspirin tablets.

428
00:27:54,011 --> 00:27:55,911
Under the Napoleonic Code...

429
00:27:56,113 --> 00:27:59,412
...a man has to take an
interest in his wife's affairs.

430
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:02,141
Especially now that she's having a baby.

431
00:28:08,125 --> 00:28:10,150
Stella's having a baby?

432
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:17,665
I didn't know she was having a baby.

433
00:28:25,642 --> 00:28:27,940
Oh, Stella for a star!

434
00:28:28,478 --> 00:28:30,844
How lovely to have a baby!

435
00:28:32,149 --> 00:28:33,946
Everything's all right.

436
00:28:34,384 --> 00:28:38,286
We thrashed it out. I feel shaky,
but I handled it nicely.

437
00:28:38,488 --> 00:28:42,447
I treated it as a joke. Laughed,
called him a boy and flirted.

438
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:45,127
Yes, I was flirting with your husband.

439
00:28:45,329 --> 00:28:47,854
The guests are arriving for the party.

440
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,308
I'm sorry he did that to you.

441
00:28:59,009 --> 00:29:02,706
I guess he's just not the type
that goes for jasmine perfume.

442
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:07,210
Maybe he's what we need to mix with
our blood since we've lost Belle Reve...

443
00:29:07,417 --> 00:29:10,716
...and have to go on without
Belle Reve to protect us.

444
00:29:13,357 --> 00:29:15,325
How pretty the sky is!

445
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:19,388
I ought to go there on a
rocket that never comes down.

446
00:29:19,596 --> 00:29:21,826
Which way do we go now?

447
00:29:22,032 --> 00:29:23,329
This way?

448
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,568
No, honey, this way.

449
00:29:25,769 --> 00:29:29,000
The blind are leading the blind.

450
00:29:29,273 --> 00:29:31,173
Red hots!

451
00:29:50,294 --> 00:29:52,421
Go upstairs and tell her to stop that.

452
00:29:52,629 --> 00:29:55,097
If I go up, I won't come down.
Forget it.

453
00:29:56,066 --> 00:29:59,263
Remember when she poured boiling
water through the floor cracks?

454
00:30:11,915 --> 00:30:14,383
- I gotta go home soon.
- What do you say?

455
00:30:14,584 --> 00:30:17,951
- No, I'm out.
- Every time you win a pot you're out!

456
00:30:18,155 --> 00:30:20,715
My mother doesn't sleep
until I come home.

457
00:30:20,924 --> 00:30:22,221
What do you say?

458
00:30:22,426 --> 00:30:24,053
I'm going to wash up.

459
00:30:29,499 --> 00:30:32,730
You tell them guys the
kettle's on the stove!

460
00:30:32,936 --> 00:30:35,131
I'm going to break up the game.

461
00:30:39,509 --> 00:30:40,567
Wait.

462
00:30:40,777 --> 00:30:44,645
Let me powder. I feel hot and
frazzled. Do I look done-in?

463
00:30:44,848 --> 00:30:46,475
You look fresh as a daisy.

464
00:30:46,683 --> 00:30:49,083
One that's been picked a few days.

465
00:30:49,953 --> 00:30:53,480
Why don't somebody go to the
Chinaman's and bring back chop suey?

466
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:57,490
- When I'm losing, you want to eat.
- I see you are still at it.

467
00:30:57,694 --> 00:30:59,594
- Where've you been?
- We went to a show.

468
00:30:59,796 --> 00:31:02,492
This is Mr. Gonzales and Mr. Hubbell.

469
00:31:02,699 --> 00:31:04,599
Hello. Please, don't get up.

470
00:31:04,801 --> 00:31:06,996
No one's getting up, don't worry.

471
00:31:07,204 --> 00:31:09,331
Poker's fascinating. Could I kibitz?

472
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:10,665
You could not!

473
00:31:10,874 --> 00:31:13,001
Why don't you go up to Eunice's?

474
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:16,338
- How long will you play?
- Till we're ready to quit!

475
00:31:16,546 --> 00:31:18,776
- Wish you'd quit after the next hand.

476
00:31:18,982 --> 00:31:21,109
Hey, that's my coat!

477
00:31:22,886 --> 00:31:24,683
That's not fun, Stanley.

478
00:31:27,324 --> 00:31:30,452
Makes me mad when he does
that in front of people.

479
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,787
- I think I will bathe.
- Again?

480
00:31:32,996 --> 00:31:35,464
My nerves are in knots. Is it occupied?

481
00:31:35,665 --> 00:31:37,030
I don't know.

482
00:31:37,501 --> 00:31:38,627
Good evening.

483
00:31:38,835 --> 00:31:39,859
Hello.

484
00:31:40,237 --> 00:31:44,139
This is Harold Mitchell.
This is my sister, Blanche DuBois.

485
00:31:44,341 --> 00:31:46,809
- How do you do?
- How do you do, Miss DuBois?

486
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:48,307
How's your mother?

487
00:31:48,512 --> 00:31:52,380
She's about the same, thanks.
She appreciated that custard.

488
00:31:53,517 --> 00:31:55,212
Excuse me, please.

489
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,544
Excuse me.

490
00:32:08,198 --> 00:32:11,656
- That one seems superior to the others.
- Does he?

491
00:32:11,868 --> 00:32:13,995
He had a sort of sensitive look.

492
00:32:14,204 --> 00:32:15,728
His mother's sick.

493
00:32:15,939 --> 00:32:17,338
Is he married?

494
00:32:18,608 --> 00:32:20,007
Is he a wolf?

495
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:21,507
Why, Blanche!

496
00:32:21,778 --> 00:32:25,509
- No, I don't think he would be.
- What does he do?

497
00:32:25,715 --> 00:32:28,843
He's on the precision bench in
the spare parts department...

498
00:32:29,052 --> 00:32:31,077
...the plant Stanley travels for.

499
00:32:31,288 --> 00:32:33,085
Is that something much?

500
00:32:33,723 --> 00:32:36,521
Stanley's the only one
likely to get anywhere.

501
00:32:36,726 --> 00:32:38,193
Flush, win!

502
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:43,098
Blanche, you're standing in the light!

503
00:32:44,301 --> 00:32:46,098
Am I? Gracious!

504
00:32:47,737 --> 00:32:49,364
You should see their wives!

505
00:32:49,573 --> 00:32:52,201
I can imagine. Big,
beefy things, I suppose.

506
00:32:52,409 --> 00:32:54,377
You know that one upstairs?

507
00:32:59,749 --> 00:33:02,775
Hey, you hens! Cut out
that cackling in there!

508
00:33:02,986 --> 00:33:04,385
You can't hear us!

509
00:33:04,588 --> 00:33:06,954
You can hear me and I said, hush up!

510
00:33:09,993 --> 00:33:13,554
This is my house and I'll
talk as much as I want to!

511
00:33:14,431 --> 00:33:15,796
Don't start a row.

512
00:33:15,999 --> 00:33:17,899
He's half-drunk.

513
00:33:18,101 --> 00:33:19,796
I'll be out in a minute.

514
00:33:24,441 --> 00:33:25,305
50 cents.

515
00:33:25,509 --> 00:33:27,409
All right. See you.

516
00:33:30,947 --> 00:33:32,073
Well, Steve?

517
00:33:32,282 --> 00:33:33,249
I'm out.

518
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:34,417
Two bucks.

519
00:33:45,295 --> 00:33:46,660
What do you say?

520
00:33:48,465 --> 00:33:50,490
Come on, are you in?

521
00:33:51,301 --> 00:33:52,427
I'm out!

522
00:33:52,636 --> 00:33:54,331
Who turned that on in there?

523
00:33:55,539 --> 00:33:57,097
I did. Do you mind?

524
00:33:57,307 --> 00:34:00,003
- Turn it off!
- Let the girls have music.

525
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:01,336
Sounds good.

526
00:34:09,553 --> 00:34:11,282
There you are!

527
00:34:11,488 --> 00:34:13,854
- I didn't hear you name it!
- Didn't I name it?

528
00:34:14,057 --> 00:34:15,888
- I wasn't listening.
- What were you doing?

529
00:34:16,226 --> 00:34:18,786
- Looking through the drapes.
- I wasn't.

530
00:34:18,995 --> 00:34:22,624
We're dealing this hand over again.
Play cards, or quit.

531
00:34:22,832 --> 00:34:24,026
Deal me out!

532
00:34:24,334 --> 00:34:26,131
This game'll be Spit in the Ocean.

533
00:34:38,848 --> 00:34:39,872
Hello.

534
00:34:44,521 --> 00:34:45,545
Excuse me.

535
00:34:45,755 --> 00:34:49,213
The little boy's room
is occupied right now.

536
00:34:49,926 --> 00:34:51,484
Excuse me.

537
00:34:51,695 --> 00:34:53,219
Have you got any cigs?

538
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:54,727
Sure.

539
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,827
What a pretty case.

540
00:34:59,369 --> 00:35:00,495
Silver?

541
00:35:01,371 --> 00:35:05,171
- Yes. Read the inscription.
- There is an inscription.

542
00:35:05,375 --> 00:35:07,400
Why, I can't make it out.

543
00:35:11,615 --> 00:35:14,015
"And if God choose...

544
00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:19,020
...I shall but love thee
better after death."

545
00:35:19,222 --> 00:35:21,918
That's from my favorite
sonnet by Mrs. Browning.

546
00:35:22,292 --> 00:35:24,192
- You know it!
- Certainly.

547
00:35:24,394 --> 00:35:27,363
There's a story connected
with this inscription.

548
00:35:27,564 --> 00:35:28,758
A romance?

549
00:35:28,965 --> 00:35:31,195
A sad one. The girl's dead now.

550
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:36,695
She knew she was dying when she
give me this. Strange, sweet girl.

551
00:35:38,241 --> 00:35:40,368
She must have been very fond of you.

552
00:35:40,577 --> 00:35:43,444
Sick people have deep,
sincere attachments.

553
00:35:43,647 --> 00:35:44,705
They do.

554
00:35:44,914 --> 00:35:48,611
- Sorrow makes for sincerity, I think.
- It brings it out.

555
00:35:48,818 --> 00:35:52,549
The little there is belongs to
people who have known sorrow.

556
00:35:52,989 --> 00:35:54,957
- I believe you're right.
- I'm positive.

557
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:58,889
Deal me out. I'm talking to Miss...

558
00:36:00,797 --> 00:36:01,991
DuBois.

559
00:36:04,534 --> 00:36:06,934
It's a French name, meaning, "woods."

560
00:36:07,137 --> 00:36:10,436
And Blanche means "white." So the
two together mean, "white woods."

561
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,201
Like an orchard in spring.
You can remember it by that...

562
00:36:14,411 --> 00:36:15,776
...if you care to.

563
00:36:16,546 --> 00:36:18,776
You are Stella's sister, are you not?

564
00:36:19,149 --> 00:36:21,117
Stella's my precious little sister.

565
00:36:21,317 --> 00:36:24,616
I call her "little" though
she's older than I am.

566
00:36:26,489 --> 00:36:28,719
Just slightly. Less than a year.

567
00:36:28,925 --> 00:36:31,393
- Will you do something for me?
- Yes. What?

568
00:36:31,561 --> 00:36:35,224
I bought this adorable paper
lantern at a Chinese shop.

569
00:36:35,432 --> 00:36:37,457
Put it over the light bulb, will you?

570
00:36:37,767 --> 00:36:39,132
I'd be glad to.

571
00:36:39,335 --> 00:36:43,237
I can't stand a naked light bulb
anymore than I can a rude remark...

572
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,135
...or a vulgar action.

573
00:36:45,575 --> 00:36:48,908
I guess we strike you as
being a pretty rough bunch.

574
00:36:50,046 --> 00:36:51,809
I'm very adaptable...

575
00:36:52,015 --> 00:36:54,813
...to circumstances.
- That's a good way to be.

576
00:36:57,587 --> 00:37:00,420
- You're not...
- Married? Oh, no, no!

577
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:02,553
I'm an old-maid teacher.

578
00:37:02,792 --> 00:37:06,250
You may be a teacher, but you're
certainly not an old maid.

579
00:37:07,697 --> 00:37:09,562
Why, thank you, sir.

580
00:37:09,799 --> 00:37:11,994
I appreciate your gallantry.

581
00:37:14,471 --> 00:37:16,564
So you're in the teaching profession?

582
00:37:19,809 --> 00:37:21,572
Grade school or high school?

583
00:37:21,811 --> 00:37:23,073
Coming!

584
00:37:23,313 --> 00:37:27,272
Gracious, what lung power!
I teach high school in Auriol.

585
00:37:28,318 --> 00:37:29,945
What subject do you teach?

586
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,087
Guess.

587
00:37:31,321 --> 00:37:34,347
I bet you teach art or music.

588
00:37:35,058 --> 00:37:37,458
Of course, I could be wrong.

589
00:37:37,627 --> 00:37:39,026
You might teach math.

590
00:37:39,229 --> 00:37:41,527
Never math, sir. Never math.

591
00:37:41,731 --> 00:37:46,464
I have the misfortune of
being an English instructor.

592
00:37:46,836 --> 00:37:50,704
I try to instill a bunch of bobby-
soxers and drugstore Romeos...

593
00:37:50,907 --> 00:37:54,604
...with a reverence for
Hawthorne and Whitman and Poe.

594
00:37:54,844 --> 00:37:57,312
I bet they are more
interested in other things.

595
00:37:57,514 --> 00:37:59,311
How very right you are.

596
00:37:59,516 --> 00:38:03,316
Their literary heritage is not
what they treasure above all.

597
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,044
But they're sweet things.

598
00:38:05,255 --> 00:38:10,124
In spring, it's touching to see them
making their first discovery of love.

599
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:13,322
As if nobody had ever known it...

600
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:14,554
...before.

601
00:38:17,767 --> 00:38:18,995
Sorry.

602
00:38:19,269 --> 00:38:20,634
Excuse me!

603
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:22,337
Have you finished?

604
00:38:22,539 --> 00:38:23,563
Oh, yes.

605
00:38:23,773 --> 00:38:26,640
- I have.
- Wait. I'll turn on the radio.

606
00:38:29,045 --> 00:38:30,842
Turn on the light now.

607
00:38:32,382 --> 00:38:33,747
Oh, look!

608
00:38:34,117 --> 00:38:36,347
We've made enchantment.

609
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,359
3 bullets, moustache!

610
00:38:49,566 --> 00:38:51,261
Straight! I got you!

611
00:38:54,704 --> 00:38:56,934
- What are you doing?
- Let me alone!

612
00:38:58,308 --> 00:39:00,173
Drunk! You animal thing!

613
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:01,870
Get out!

614
00:39:02,078 --> 00:39:03,045
Get out!

615
00:39:04,581 --> 00:39:06,276
- What're you doing?
- Get out.

616
00:39:06,482 --> 00:39:08,541
My sister's going to have a baby!

617
00:39:12,155 --> 00:39:14,282
Lunacy! Complete lunacy!

618
00:39:14,591 --> 00:39:16,388
You come up to my place.

619
00:39:16,593 --> 00:39:18,288
Did he hurt you?

620
00:39:18,494 --> 00:39:22,555
- Make him go away!
- Poker shouldn't be played around women.

621
00:39:23,833 --> 00:39:25,960
Take it easy, will you?

622
00:39:31,241 --> 00:39:32,970
Get him in that shower!

623
00:39:33,176 --> 00:39:33,972
Come on.

624
00:39:34,177 --> 00:39:35,906
Get his feet, will you?

625
00:39:36,112 --> 00:39:38,080
Grab his feet. Come on.

626
00:39:38,248 --> 00:39:41,149
Come on, get under there. Stay.

627
00:39:41,951 --> 00:39:43,316
Get under there.

628
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:45,987
Get him a little higher, that's right.

629
00:39:46,256 --> 00:39:48,224
- How you feel?
- There you are.

630
00:39:49,259 --> 00:39:50,590
Wake up.

631
00:39:51,527 --> 00:39:53,324
We should remove his clothes.

632
00:39:54,764 --> 00:39:56,322
What're you doing?!

633
00:40:02,205 --> 00:40:05,504
Poker should not be played
around women!

634
00:40:09,379 --> 00:40:10,505
Where's Steve?

635
00:40:10,713 --> 00:40:12,237
Take it easy!

636
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:37,365
Honey?

637
00:40:43,913 --> 00:40:45,471
Where are you?

638
00:40:59,262 --> 00:41:00,786
Hey, baby!

639
00:41:12,275 --> 00:41:15,301
You can sleep over here.
Blanche can have Steve's place.

640
00:41:15,545 --> 00:41:18,412
He ain't coming home if he
knows what's good for him.

641
00:41:21,784 --> 00:41:26,687
Look! She ain't coming down and she
ain't going to talk to you neither.

642
00:41:37,867 --> 00:41:39,835
Stop hollering and go to bed.

643
00:41:40,069 --> 00:41:41,832
I want my girl.

644
00:41:42,071 --> 00:41:44,539
Shut up, or you'll get the law on you.

645
00:41:44,741 --> 00:41:48,700
You can't beat up a woman then
call her back. She ain't coming.

646
00:41:48,878 --> 00:41:52,939
- They'll haul you in like last time!
- I want my girl down here.

647
00:41:53,149 --> 00:41:54,707
You stinker!

648
00:42:17,774 --> 00:42:19,571
I wouldn't mix in this!

649
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:23,129
Please, don't ever leave me, baby.

650
00:43:40,089 --> 00:43:41,454
Come back!

651
00:44:08,384 --> 00:44:09,681
Miss DuBois?

652
00:44:15,725 --> 00:44:18,250
All quiet along the Potomac now?

653
00:44:18,461 --> 00:44:20,588
She ran down and went back in with him.

654
00:44:20,796 --> 00:44:22,423
- Sure, she did.
- I'm terrified.

655
00:44:22,632 --> 00:44:25,260
Don't be. They're
crazy about each other.

656
00:44:25,468 --> 00:44:28,369
- Shame it happened your first day.
- Violence is so...

657
00:44:28,538 --> 00:44:31,006
Sit down and have a cigarette with me.

658
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,606
Why, I'm not properly dressed.

659
00:44:33,809 --> 00:44:35,709
That doesn't matter here.

660
00:44:37,914 --> 00:44:40,382
Such a pretty silver case.

661
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:42,950
I showed you the inscription, didn't I?

662
00:44:50,059 --> 00:44:51,390
There's so much...

663
00:44:51,994 --> 00:44:54,019
...so much confusion in the world.

664
00:44:56,999 --> 00:44:59,024
Thank you for being so kind.

665
00:44:59,769 --> 00:45:01,737
I need kindness now.

666
00:45:09,178 --> 00:45:10,805
Bananas!

667
00:45:13,783 --> 00:45:15,410
Bananas!

668
00:45:31,867 --> 00:45:34,563
Oh, my baby. My baby sister!

669
00:45:35,104 --> 00:45:37,572
- What's the matter with you?
- He's left?

670
00:45:38,874 --> 00:45:42,173
- Will he be back?
- He's getting the car greased.

671
00:45:42,378 --> 00:45:46,007
I've been half-crazy.
How could you come back last night?

672
00:45:46,215 --> 00:45:50,174
Please, he was as good as
a lamb when I came back.

673
00:45:50,386 --> 00:45:52,513
He's really very ashamed of himself.

674
00:45:53,222 --> 00:45:55,588
And that makes it all right?

675
00:45:56,826 --> 00:45:59,693
Stanley's always smashed things.

676
00:46:00,229 --> 00:46:03,198
On our wedding night, as
soon as we came in here...

677
00:46:03,833 --> 00:46:08,293
...he snatched off my slipper and
rushed around smashing light bulbs.

678
00:46:08,904 --> 00:46:10,098
He did what?

679
00:46:12,008 --> 00:46:15,102
He smashed all the light bulbs
with the heel of my slipper.

680
00:46:15,344 --> 00:46:17,608
And you let him, didn't run?

681
00:46:19,148 --> 00:46:21,309
I was sort of thrilled by it.

682
00:46:23,352 --> 00:46:25,320
Eunice and you had breakfast?

683
00:46:25,855 --> 00:46:28,221
Do you suppose I wanted any breakfast?

684
00:46:28,658 --> 00:46:31,388
You're so matter of fact
about it all, Stella.

685
00:46:31,594 --> 00:46:33,824
Well, what other can I be?

686
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:36,898
He took the radio to get it fixed.

687
00:46:37,099 --> 00:46:40,728
It didn't land on the pavement
so only one tube smashed.

688
00:46:40,936 --> 00:46:44,497
- And you stand there smiling?
- What should I do?

689
00:46:44,674 --> 00:46:48,075
- Face the facts.
- What are they, in your opinion?

690
00:46:48,277 --> 00:46:50,575
You're married to a madman.

691
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,840
I have a plan for us
both to get out of here.

692
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:57,417
Stop taking it for granted
that I want to get out.

693
00:46:57,620 --> 00:47:00,851
I take for granted you have
sufficient memory of Belle Reve...

694
00:47:01,057 --> 00:47:04,857
...to find it impossible to live here.
- You take too much for granted.

695
00:47:05,061 --> 00:47:06,653
I can't believe you.

696
00:47:06,896 --> 00:47:08,591
I understand how it happened.

697
00:47:08,798 --> 00:47:11,528
You saw him first in uniform,
an officer, not here...

698
00:47:11,701 --> 00:47:13,601
That doesn't make any difference.

699
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:17,767
We're talking about his desire.
His brutal desire.

700
00:47:18,074 --> 00:47:21,373
The name of that streetcar that
bangs through the quarter.

701
00:47:21,577 --> 00:47:23,670
Up one narrow street and down another.

702
00:47:23,913 --> 00:47:26,381
Have you ever ridden on that streetcar?

703
00:47:29,485 --> 00:47:31,180
It brought me here...

704
00:47:32,221 --> 00:47:33,882
...where I'm not wanted.

705
00:47:34,156 --> 00:47:35,885
Where I'm ashamed to be.

706
00:47:36,092 --> 00:47:39,186
Isn't your superior attitude
a little out of place?

707
00:47:39,428 --> 00:47:41,692
- A man like that.
- I love him!

708
00:47:41,931 --> 00:47:43,694
I tremble for you.

709
00:47:44,166 --> 00:47:47,397
I can't help your trembling
if you insist on trembling.

710
00:47:56,946 --> 00:47:58,914
May I speak plainly?

711
00:48:00,182 --> 00:48:03,811
Yes, do. Go ahead.
As plainly as you want.

712
00:48:04,954 --> 00:48:06,581
If you'll forgive me...

713
00:48:07,256 --> 00:48:08,314
...he's common.

714
00:48:12,862 --> 00:48:14,989
Yes, I suppose he is.

715
00:48:15,631 --> 00:48:17,098
Suppose?

716
00:48:17,266 --> 00:48:20,429
You can't have forgotten that
much of our upbringing...

717
00:48:20,636 --> 00:48:24,231
...that you suppose there's any
part of a gentleman in his nature.

718
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:27,236
You're hating me saying
this, aren't you?

719
00:48:28,144 --> 00:48:30,669
Go on. Say it all, Blanche.

720
00:48:34,216 --> 00:48:35,740
He's like an animal.

721
00:48:36,552 --> 00:48:41,455
He has an animal's habits.
There's something subhuman about him.

722
00:48:41,657 --> 00:48:45,024
Thousands of years have passed
him by and there he is...

723
00:48:45,227 --> 00:48:48,253
...Stanley Kowalski,
survivor of the Stone Age...

724
00:48:48,497 --> 00:48:51,466
...bearing the raw meat home
from the kill in the jungle.

725
00:48:51,667 --> 00:48:55,763
You wait. Maybe he'll strike
you... or grunt, kiss you...

726
00:48:56,005 --> 00:48:57,768
...if kisses have been discovered.

727
00:48:58,007 --> 00:49:00,771
His poker night, you call it.
His party of apes?

728
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:05,139
Maybe we are a long way from
being made in God's image...

729
00:49:05,915 --> 00:49:07,780
...but, Stella, my sister...

730
00:49:08,017 --> 00:49:10,542
...there's been progress since then.

731
00:49:10,753 --> 00:49:13,722
Such things as art, as poetry, as music.

732
00:49:14,023 --> 00:49:18,892
In some kinds of people, some tenderer
feelings have had a little beginning...

733
00:49:19,328 --> 00:49:21,990
...that we must make
grow and cling to...

734
00:49:22,198 --> 00:49:26,897
...and hold as our flag in this march
toward whatever it is we're approaching.

735
00:49:27,102 --> 00:49:30,663
Don't, don't hang back with the brutes!

736
00:50:26,495 --> 00:50:27,553
Hi ya.

737
00:50:32,601 --> 00:50:34,364
Is Blanche back yet?

738
00:50:37,406 --> 00:50:38,964
Yeah, she's back.

739
00:50:40,409 --> 00:50:42,070
Oh, hi there, Blanche.

740
00:50:43,279 --> 00:50:45,144
Looks like you got under the car.

741
00:50:46,015 --> 00:50:50,475
That jerk mechanic down at Fritz's
doesn't know grease from 3rd base.

742
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:13,408
Don't throw that thing at me!

743
00:51:13,642 --> 00:51:15,269
I can fix things.

744
00:51:17,947 --> 00:51:21,610
- Just what I gave your brother.
- I'll call the police.

745
00:51:22,451 --> 00:51:25,113
He hit me. I'm calling the police.

746
00:51:25,321 --> 00:51:25,912
You saw!

747
00:51:26,155 --> 00:51:29,613
Your sister's friends have
stayed in the city awhile.

748
00:51:33,562 --> 00:51:35,530
Did Eunice get the police?

749
00:51:35,731 --> 00:51:39,189
- No, she's getting a drink.
- That's much more practical.

750
00:51:40,402 --> 00:51:43,030
Blanche is making us new slipcovers.

751
00:51:44,673 --> 00:51:45,697
Is she here?

752
00:51:45,908 --> 00:51:47,705
She went to the Four Deuces.

753
00:51:48,243 --> 00:51:50,211
That no-good, rotten...

754
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:57,048
I can't find my other pair of shoes.

755
00:51:57,987 --> 00:51:59,887
We cleaned in there.

756
00:52:00,089 --> 00:52:01,386
I'll get them.

757
00:52:02,925 --> 00:52:05,723
I can't find nothing
around this dump anymore.

758
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:13,159
What sign were you born under?

759
00:52:13,869 --> 00:52:14,733
What sign?

760
00:52:15,204 --> 00:52:16,728
Astrological sign.

761
00:52:16,939 --> 00:52:20,568
I bet you were born under Aries.
Aries people are forceful, dynamic.

762
00:52:20,776 --> 00:52:23,574
They dote on noise.
They love to bang things around.

763
00:52:23,779 --> 00:52:26,475
Stanley was born five
minutes after Christmas.

764
00:52:27,383 --> 00:52:29,248
Capricorn. The goat!

765
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:42,688
Say...

766
00:52:43,232 --> 00:52:45,757
...do you know somebody named Shaw?

767
00:52:47,403 --> 00:52:51,203
Everybody knows someone
by the name of Shaw.

768
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:55,938
This somebody named Shaw
believes he met you in Auriol.

769
00:52:56,545 --> 00:53:01,448
But I figure he must of mixed you up
with someone else because this party...

770
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:04,218
...he met at a hotel
called The Flamingo.

771
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:08,220
I guess he does have me mixed
up with this other party.

772
00:53:08,424 --> 00:53:12,121
The Hotel Flamingo is not a
place I'd dare to be seen in.

773
00:53:13,062 --> 00:53:14,893
You know it then?

774
00:53:15,064 --> 00:53:16,463
I've seen it...

775
00:53:16,665 --> 00:53:17,893
...and smelled it.

776
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,900
You must've got close to smell it.

777
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:23,971
The odor of cheap
perfume is penetrating.

778
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:26,398
You use expensive stuff?

779
00:53:27,776 --> 00:53:29,801
$12 an ounce. I'm nearly out...

780
00:53:30,012 --> 00:53:32,310
...if you want to remember...

781
00:53:36,285 --> 00:53:39,311
I figure that he must
of got you mixed up.

782
00:53:39,521 --> 00:53:42,319
But he goes in and out of
Auriol all the time...

783
00:53:42,858 --> 00:53:45,554
...so he can check and
clear up any mistake.

784
00:53:50,466 --> 00:53:52,161
See you at the Four Deuces.

785
00:53:52,367 --> 00:53:53,834
Don't I rate a kiss?

786
00:53:54,036 --> 00:53:56,061
Not in front of your sister.

787
00:54:05,514 --> 00:54:09,746
Don't cry. I only do that with
other girls because I love you, baby.

788
00:54:10,119 --> 00:54:11,416
It's a fact.

789
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:23,357
You still scared of thunder?

790
00:54:24,133 --> 00:54:26,101
What've you heard about me?

791
00:54:27,569 --> 00:54:29,867
What have people been telling you...

792
00:54:30,139 --> 00:54:31,197
...about me?

793
00:54:32,908 --> 00:54:33,875
Telling?

794
00:54:34,576 --> 00:54:36,203
You haven't heard any...

795
00:54:36,578 --> 00:54:39,046
...unkind gossip about me?

796
00:54:40,349 --> 00:54:42,943
Why, no, Blanche. Of course not.

797
00:54:43,152 --> 00:54:44,210
Honey...

798
00:54:44,486 --> 00:54:46,886
...there was quite a lot of talk...

799
00:54:47,089 --> 00:54:48,215
...in Auriol.

800
00:54:48,657 --> 00:54:50,955
People talk, who cares?

801
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:54,323
I haven't been so good
the last year or so...

802
00:54:54,496 --> 00:54:57,056
...since Belle Reve began slipping away.

803
00:54:57,266 --> 00:55:01,566
- We all do things.
- I was never hard enough.

804
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:02,896
Soft people...

805
00:55:03,105 --> 00:55:06,563
...have got to court
the favor of hard ones.

806
00:55:07,009 --> 00:55:08,840
They must shimmer and glow.

807
00:55:09,278 --> 00:55:11,838
How much longer I can turn the trick?

808
00:55:12,014 --> 00:55:14,073
It isn't enough to be soft.

809
00:55:14,283 --> 00:55:15,841
You must be soft...

810
00:55:16,018 --> 00:55:17,485
...and attractive.

811
00:55:17,886 --> 00:55:18,978
And I...

812
00:55:19,788 --> 00:55:21,415
I'm fading now.

813
00:55:27,629 --> 00:55:29,358
Have you been listening to me?

814
00:55:30,399 --> 00:55:32,924
I never listen when you're being morbid.
