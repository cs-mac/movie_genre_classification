1
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:12,594
Jake,
you used to be a lot faster.

2
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,405
Dad, you're not helping!

3
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:18,566
Now now, patience is a virtue, son.

4
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,433
Oh, just bite me.

5
00:00:32,601 --> 00:00:33,545
We got you.

6
00:00:35,042 --> 00:00:36,919
We got you. Stay here.

7
00:00:39,253 --> 00:00:40,237
Follow him!

8
00:00:57,697 --> 00:00:59,827
Don't go up there.
It's too dangerous.

9
00:00:59,952 --> 00:01:01,454
Too late, I'm committed!

10
00:01:08,754 --> 00:01:10,903
For God sakes,
we're private investigators,

11
00:01:11,072 --> 00:01:12,250
not militia men.

12
00:01:14,323 --> 00:01:15,533
What's your problem?!

13
00:01:28,032 --> 00:01:30,460
- You nearly killed the both of you.
- I'd ask you to help me,

14
00:01:30,585 --> 00:01:32,550
but you'll never get
your walker down here.

15
00:01:33,249 --> 00:01:34,301
I'm going home.

16
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,194
Fine.

17
00:01:37,001 --> 00:01:39,765
Don't mind him,
he's emotional at times.

18
00:01:58,035 --> 00:01:59,185
{pub}~ Willow's Team ~

19
00:02:10,377 --> 00:02:13,491
This is uncalled for, man,
I got rights, you know. I'm an artist.

20
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,056
{pos(192,215)}Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

21
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:16,879
{pos(192,215)}Why is he still here?

22
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:19,032
{pos(192,215)}Is there a brain in there
or just dandelion?

23
00:02:19,157 --> 00:02:21,557
{pos(192,215)}- You pushed him off a building!
- It wasn't that bad.

24
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:24,501
- He shouldn't be here. He could sue us.
- I gotta put him somewhere.

25
00:02:24,626 --> 00:02:27,036
Maybe I will sue you.
And I'm hungry,

26
00:02:27,161 --> 00:02:29,853
{pos(192,225)}maybe you can get me some toast
or a banana or eggs or something.

27
00:02:29,978 --> 00:02:32,186
{pos(192,225)}- Shut up!
- Why aren't you at school?

28
00:02:32,522 --> 00:02:35,115
I'm not feeling good.
Women troubles.

29
00:02:36,733 --> 00:02:39,700
{pos(252,265)}Really? That's the third time this
month. Why don't you go to the clinic?

30
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:43,136
- I'll get right on that.
- Mal, we have a client, remember?

31
00:02:43,261 --> 00:02:44,330
Dr. Natche ?

32
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,452
{pos(202,265)}- Right.
- What's that all about?

33
00:02:46,577 --> 00:02:48,459
{pos(202,265)}- Who's this?
- Des Courtney, baby.

34
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:51,657
In the flesh and I'm going to sue you,
I'm probably get the house.

35
00:02:51,782 --> 00:02:52,980
How old are you?

36
00:02:53,105 --> 00:02:55,090
- That looks bad.
- It doesn't even hurt.

37
00:02:55,558 --> 00:02:57,568
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm fit, girl.

38
00:02:57,693 --> 00:02:59,595
- You're fit are ya?
- Yeah, I'm fit.

39
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:01,096
He's fine. He won't sue.

40
00:03:01,913 --> 00:03:03,029
Will ya, buddy?

41
00:03:05,428 --> 00:03:07,016
That's your grand daughter.

42
00:03:07,408 --> 00:03:09,734
Now you listen to me, all right ?

43
00:03:10,652 --> 00:03:13,692
{pos(232,265)}You spray painting this city
is getting on everyone's nerves.

44
00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:16,737
- Especially city hall's.
- It's my art.

45
00:03:17,587 --> 00:03:19,323
- It is not art.
- I like it.

46
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:21,659
- Thank you.
- Shut up and stay out of this.

47
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:24,793
{pos(192,225)}I catch you spray painting the city
again,  I'll shove this can of paint

48
00:03:24,918 --> 00:03:26,664
{pos(192,225)}directly up your arse.
Do you understand?

49
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:29,333
Jake. Mal. Get in here right now.

50
00:03:29,525 --> 00:03:31,901
{pos(242,265)}- You're a real dick, you know.
- Beat it.

51
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,380
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.

52
00:03:35,784 --> 00:03:37,733
{pos(192,215)}So he fired his lawyer? Why?

53
00:03:37,858 --> 00:03:40,636
{pos(192,215)}I don't know. I don't know what to do,
where else to turn.

54
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:43,039
The police found
Benny standing over his boss.

55
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:47,101
Brian Harris. Benny was covered in blood
with the assault weapon in his hand.

56
00:03:47,485 --> 00:03:49,562
- Where are the cops with this?
- They think he did it

57
00:03:49,783 --> 00:03:52,225
and Benny isn't helping.
He refuses to defend himself.

58
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,079
Says he doesn't remember.

59
00:03:54,955 --> 00:03:57,444
If I beat someone like this,
I tell you, I'd remember.

60
00:03:57,658 --> 00:04:00,821
Amir, this is an open police case.
We're private detectives.

61
00:04:00,946 --> 00:04:03,943
- But you can use your influence.
- I haven't been a cop for years.

62
00:04:04,068 --> 00:04:06,953
Benjamin is my son,
he's accused of almost killing a man.

63
00:04:07,432 --> 00:04:10,749
Jake, you and Benny grew up together.
You know he couldn't do this to anyone.

64
00:04:10,924 --> 00:04:12,279
He need your help.

65
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:16,796
We'll do everything we can.

66
00:04:30,227 --> 00:04:33,804
{pos(192,215)}Hey. Be careful what you say to Benny,
you know what he's like.

67
00:04:33,929 --> 00:04:35,879
{pos(192,215)}- Stubborn, like you.
- I know what I'm doing.

68
00:04:36,004 --> 00:04:38,819
- I gotta take this. All right?
- Oh c'mon. I haven't got all day.

69
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,605
{pos(252,265)}- Would you relax a little bit?
- You're always on that thing.

70
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,728
{pos(252,265)}No wonder
your ears glow in the dark.

71
00:04:45,135 --> 00:04:47,434
<i>{pos(252,265)}- How bad is it, Walter?
- Do you want to reconcile?</i>

72
00:04:47,559 --> 00:04:48,996
{pos(252,265)}Very funny.
What does she want?

73
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,928
It's Nikki, she wants everything.

74
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,118
Are you at a strip club?

75
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,123
No. Well yeah.

76
00:04:55,248 --> 00:04:57,535
Walter, it's still morning, man.

77
00:04:58,308 --> 00:05:01,732
- The brunch has scallops now.
- Hold on I have another call.

78
00:05:02,481 --> 00:05:04,094
- Hello?
- You son of a bitch.

79
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,410
What are you doing?
We gotta talk through our lawyers.

80
00:05:06,535 --> 00:05:09,365
I'm your wife. I want to talk to you,
not stupid Walter.

81
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,434
Hold on.

82
00:05:11,158 --> 00:05:13,437
- It's her.
- Tell her to talk to me.

83
00:05:13,562 --> 00:05:16,232
I did.
She's not exactly into that idea.

84
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:18,943
- What does she want?
- Hold on, I'll ask her?

85
00:05:19,622 --> 00:05:22,061
- What do you want?
- For you to grow a pair.

86
00:05:22,186 --> 00:05:23,588
Okay, just hold on.

87
00:05:24,138 --> 00:05:26,992
Walter, she's insane. How did you
let me marry her in the first place?

88
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,203
Still me.

89
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:35,633
<i>- Walter?
- Yeah?</i>

90
00:05:35,758 --> 00:05:39,083
Get me a restraining order
or something, okay?

91
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,715
- Come on!
- Coming!

92
00:05:42,122 --> 00:05:43,252
Sorry about that.

93
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:46,083
Benny!

94
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,848
Still wearing
the school colour, I see.

95
00:05:50,194 --> 00:05:52,813
- What are ya doing here?
- Your father hired us.

96
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,376
What? No.

97
00:05:54,814 --> 00:05:57,628
Jake, I don't want him involved.
All right?

98
00:05:57,753 --> 00:06:00,067
Benny, look around, buddy.
You're in jail.

99
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:01,821
He's pretty involved already.

100
00:06:01,946 --> 00:06:05,190
Benny, sometimes it helps to talk it
through with someone you know and trust.

101
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:08,286
Tell me about this... Brian guy,

102
00:06:08,645 --> 00:06:09,766
your boss.

103
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,703
He runs the party boat in the harbour,
throws raves. I'm his DJ.

104
00:06:16,836 --> 00:06:20,004
Jake, seriously man.
This is just going to upset my dad.

105
00:06:20,342 --> 00:06:21,239
Upset?

106
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,342
You're in serious trouble.

107
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,006
This isn't the cops,
this isn't your old man. This is me.

108
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,783
You gotta tell me what happened.

109
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:31,420
Please?

110
00:06:32,438 --> 00:06:34,513
I don't remember. Not a thing.

111
00:06:34,638 --> 00:06:36,846
- I don't.
- I've studied the police report.

112
00:06:36,971 --> 00:06:39,048
It says you and Brian Harris
had an argument,

113
00:06:39,173 --> 00:06:41,300
then you both left.
Then there's cops everywhere,

114
00:06:41,425 --> 00:06:42,943
and you're covered in his blood!

115
00:06:43,154 --> 00:06:44,326
So they tell me.

116
00:06:44,451 --> 00:06:45,781
"So they tell me?"

117
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,984
- That's your rock solid defense?
- Jake, don't push me man.

118
00:06:49,358 --> 00:06:50,649
Buddy or no.

119
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:53,537
Why were you fighting
with Brian Harris?

120
00:06:53,768 --> 00:06:56,015
I don't know! All right?

121
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,083
Brian was always raging
about something.

122
00:06:58,285 --> 00:06:59,273
What do you mean?

123
00:06:59,398 --> 00:07:02,161
Boys, Brian makes
a ton of cash, okay?

124
00:07:02,286 --> 00:07:05,025
I wanted my cut.
That's probably why we were fighting.

125
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,801
And I was railed on E, okay?

126
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:10,847
I was totally messed up.
If I got in a fight,

127
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,264
I probably done it.

128
00:07:13,255 --> 00:07:16,229
Okay, boys?
Thank you very much. Guard!

129
00:07:16,858 --> 00:07:18,350
Benny, it wasn't you.

130
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,565
This isn't you.
I'm gonna prove it.

131
00:07:21,734 --> 00:07:22,703
Boys,

132
00:07:23,394 --> 00:07:25,626
I don't remember.

133
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:28,103
So just drop it.

134
00:07:28,273 --> 00:07:30,068
Okay? Thanks.

135
00:07:31,195 --> 00:07:32,075
Well,

136
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,537
at least he cares
about upsetting his father.

137
00:07:36,494 --> 00:07:39,744
I don't know.
Benny was high, lost it and hit him.

138
00:07:39,869 --> 00:07:41,906
- It's plausible.
- But complete memory loss?

139
00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:46,077
We've all blacked out from time
to time, I've blacked out, what?

140
00:07:46,202 --> 00:07:48,954
Hundreds of time maybe. I always
remember something the next day.

141
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:51,053
But why not try to clear your name?

142
00:07:53,101 --> 00:07:54,550
It doesn't make any sense.

143
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,354
Benny was the star DJ
on a party boat

144
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,866
owned by the victim, Brian Harris.

145
00:08:02,991 --> 00:08:05,984
Now Brian is a real piece
of business, a muscle boy

146
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,600
with 'roid rage issues.

147
00:08:07,725 --> 00:08:10,864
His wife is Theresa Harris.

148
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,241
What a lucky gal.

149
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:15,819
The party boat is co-owned
with the wife's sister, one Laura Dawe.

150
00:08:15,944 --> 00:08:17,613
So let me get this straight.

151
00:08:17,738 --> 00:08:20,370
Our victim is in business
with his sister-in-law, Laura?

152
00:08:20,495 --> 00:08:23,786
- Quite the menage a trio.
- And the boys downtown tell me

153
00:08:23,911 --> 00:08:26,653
it was a wonder the boat could float
with all the drugs on board.

154
00:08:26,778 --> 00:08:28,882
I guess that's where
Benny got the E from.

155
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,300
The erection drug?

156
00:08:31,622 --> 00:08:33,850
Dad, E is ecstasy.

157
00:08:33,975 --> 00:08:35,641
I'm joking, dumb ass.

158
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:37,470
I worked the drug squad, remember?

159
00:08:37,595 --> 00:08:39,658
We know all about
the erection drug, don't we?

160
00:08:39,783 --> 00:08:41,520
The only drug I need is love.

161
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,850
Are you two trying to make me puke?

162
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:47,006
The only other player here
is Tom O'Dea.

163
00:08:47,131 --> 00:08:49,862
Part-time DJ, has a record
for possession and trafficking.

164
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,488
Drugs never hurt anyone.

165
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:52,795
Not a one.

166
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,452
Lots of reason to think someone other
than Benny had it in for this guy.

167
00:08:56,753 --> 00:08:58,652
All right,
I'm gonna go see the wife.

168
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,248
- Of course.
- Seriously, see what she might know.

169
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,479
Go ahead.

170
00:09:03,003 --> 00:09:04,827
And I'm gonna talk to the DJ.

171
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,966
- The erection drug?
- Yeah.

172
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,338
Yeah, bye.

173
00:09:50,327 --> 00:09:52,741
Where are you going, sir?
Can we help you?

174
00:09:53,117 --> 00:09:55,613
Yeah, I could use your help.

175
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:57,117
It's okay, I know him.

176
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:00,307
Jake, meet Constable Leslie Bennit.

177
00:10:00,561 --> 00:10:01,615
Nice to meet you.

178
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,102
Leslie, Jake Doyle. Pet detective.

179
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,522
Oh, Pike, you are hilarious.

180
00:10:10,647 --> 00:10:12,404
What do you want, Mr. Doyle?

181
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,726
Call me Jake,
and I'm a private detective

182
00:10:14,851 --> 00:10:17,423
and I'm actually
working the Brian Harris assault.

183
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,780
- That's an ongoing case.
- He's so smart.

184
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:22,871
Yeah, I know that, Pike. Thanks.

185
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,553
Actually,
were you just checking me out?

186
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,892
- Excuse me?
- You were just...

187
00:10:28,665 --> 00:10:30,432
You were totally checking me out.

188
00:10:31,055 --> 00:10:32,976
No? Did you see that?

189
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,176
You weren't checking me out.

190
00:10:36,481 --> 00:10:37,842
All right, okay.

191
00:10:38,116 --> 00:10:41,958
This case its like
a family favour type thing,

192
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:45,435
and I would really appreciate if I could
talk to Mrs. Harris for a few minutes.

193
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,098
3 minutes is all I need.

194
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,204
Somehow that doesn't surprise me.

195
00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:53,193
3 minutes starting now.

196
00:10:55,334 --> 00:10:56,306
Thank you.

197
00:11:03,261 --> 00:11:04,138
Hi.

198
00:11:05,508 --> 00:11:06,623
Theresa Harris?

199
00:11:08,843 --> 00:11:11,087
I'm really about this.
Do you mind if I...

200
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:13,258
My name is Jake Doyle.

201
00:11:13,619 --> 00:11:15,036
I'm a private detective.

202
00:11:15,161 --> 00:11:17,676
I was hired
by Benny Natche's father.

203
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,722
- For Benny.
- I know this is really inappropriate,

204
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:24,291
and you're probably gonna call the cops
on me and they're gonna throw me out.

205
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,916
But do you mind if i ask you
a couple of questions?

206
00:11:28,602 --> 00:11:29,962
Yeah, I guess.

207
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,497
Thank you very much.

208
00:11:34,452 --> 00:11:35,410
Sorry.

209
00:11:36,484 --> 00:11:37,521
Look...

210
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,158
I don't think Benny
did this to your husband.

211
00:11:42,073 --> 00:11:44,189
Sure maybe they were high
and had a fight,

212
00:11:44,314 --> 00:11:46,121
but Benny is not capable of this.

213
00:11:46,366 --> 00:11:50,057
- The police say it was Benny.
- Yeah, I know, I just...

214
00:11:50,182 --> 00:11:51,538
Can you think of anyone,

215
00:11:51,663 --> 00:11:54,676
anyone at all that might
have had a grudge against your husband?

216
00:11:54,801 --> 00:11:56,214
Maybe wanted to hurt him?

217
00:11:56,574 --> 00:11:57,666
Brian...

218
00:11:59,513 --> 00:12:02,374
People don't understand him.
They think he's just some...

219
00:12:02,873 --> 00:12:04,008
muscle head.

220
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,308
But if you know him...

221
00:12:08,431 --> 00:12:10,447
I'm sorry,
this isn't such a good idea.

222
00:12:11,366 --> 00:12:13,302
Theresa,
we're just trying to make sure

223
00:12:13,427 --> 00:12:16,735
that the right person responsible
goes to jail for this. You know?

224
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,705
I'm sorry.

225
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,128
Who are you?

226
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:30,791
Jake Doyle, I'm a private detective.
Is she going to be okay?

227
00:12:31,129 --> 00:12:33,339
Besides the fact
that her husband is in a coma,

228
00:12:33,464 --> 00:12:35,420
and that she's 3 months pregnant,
she's fine.

229
00:12:35,612 --> 00:12:38,538
- She's three months pregnant?
- A private detective?

230
00:12:38,663 --> 00:12:40,527
- What do you want?
- I was just...

231
00:12:40,652 --> 00:12:43,512
Oh my God, you're Laura Dawe?
You're his business partner?

232
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:46,285
Yes. What do you want?

233
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:49,026
I was just asking your sister
if she knew of anyone

234
00:12:49,151 --> 00:12:51,561
that maybe wanted to hurt Brian.

235
00:12:51,841 --> 00:12:54,518
Yeah, Benny Natche,
the guy who did this to him.

236
00:12:54,643 --> 00:12:57,737
- Creep, go. Go!
- I'm going. Look, I'm sorry.

237
00:12:59,122 --> 00:13:01,700
If you think of anything,
anything at all. My number's...

238
00:13:15,604 --> 00:13:17,943
Looks like it's going to be
quite the party.

239
00:13:18,092 --> 00:13:20,762
You knows it. You want to pimp
your home entertainment centre?

240
00:13:20,887 --> 00:13:22,880
I don't need any speakers,
thank you...

241
00:13:23,565 --> 00:13:24,386
Tom.

242
00:13:25,162 --> 00:13:26,950
You're a DJ on a party boat.

243
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:29,030
You with the compensation board?

244
00:13:29,156 --> 00:13:32,167
I'm not here about any insurance claim,
either. But, I could be.

245
00:13:32,292 --> 00:13:34,451
So you'd better be answering
some questions.

246
00:13:35,021 --> 00:13:35,891
Like what?

247
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,720
What happened on the boat
with Brian Harris and Benny Natche?

248
00:13:38,845 --> 00:13:41,052
No, I already told the cops.

249
00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:43,363
I've got pictures of you
lugging them boxes.

250
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,689
All right!

251
00:13:48,226 --> 00:13:49,761
Brian and Benny were scrappin'.

252
00:13:50,692 --> 00:13:53,362
They was always scrappin'.

253
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,989
- What were they fighting about? Drugs?
- All's I know is...

254
00:13:58,173 --> 00:13:59,708
Brian heads off the boat.

255
00:13:59,894 --> 00:14:01,699
A bit later, Benny takes off too.

256
00:14:01,824 --> 00:14:04,885
Next thing I knows is,
five oh's is everywhere.

257
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:07,345
Anyone other than Benny
have problems with Brian?

258
00:14:07,603 --> 00:14:08,705
Here and there.

259
00:14:10,576 --> 00:14:12,559
I heard he ran
into some static out west.

260
00:14:12,856 --> 00:14:13,933
Out west?

261
00:14:14,058 --> 00:14:16,688
Alberta, baby.
That's why he came back.

262
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:18,694
What's your day job, Tom? Huh?

263
00:14:20,636 --> 00:14:22,408
You're an accountant, aren't you?

264
00:14:23,043 --> 00:14:24,112
Nah, man.

265
00:14:24,586 --> 00:14:25,614
Bank teller.

266
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:29,976
I'll just hang on to these.
In case I have some more questions.

267
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:31,204
Peace man!

268
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:49,737
Brian...

269
00:14:50,235 --> 00:14:51,172
Harris...

270
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:54,976
"Blood forced trauma to the head"...
check.

271
00:14:55,101 --> 00:14:57,926
What else we got. "Unresponsive".

272
00:15:00,223 --> 00:15:01,109
Brian!

273
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:02,785
Brian.

274
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,317
Brian? Brian, Brian?

275
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:08,156
Who did this to ya' buddy?
Brian?

276
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,200
Code blue! Code blue!

277
00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:14,454
- Jake, what...
- I didn't do anything.

278
00:15:14,631 --> 00:15:16,345
- I didn't touch him.
- Get out!

279
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,234
- I was working on...
- Get out!

280
00:15:18,581 --> 00:15:20,797
Going. Going, going.
Totally going.

281
00:15:20,922 --> 00:15:23,452
So I think you guys
are gonna handle this.

282
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:31,972
{pub}You are unbelievable!

283
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,992
- What?!
- "What?" What are you doing here?

284
00:15:35,117 --> 00:15:37,394
I didn't come here
to see you, Nikki, okay?

285
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:39,561
- This has nothing to do with us.
- Who said that?

286
00:15:39,686 --> 00:15:42,732
I'm at work. You have no right
to be here at my place of work.

287
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,928
I'm working too okay?
I'm on a case.

288
00:15:45,053 --> 00:15:46,967
I need to know what happened
to the dead guy.

289
00:15:47,092 --> 00:15:50,156
I'm a doctor, it's confidential.
It's a criminal investigation.

290
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,128
Would you stop being so dramatic?

291
00:15:52,253 --> 00:15:53,982
Jake? Walk away.

292
00:15:55,965 --> 00:15:58,887
Scram! Go on.
Give the girl some peace. Shu!

293
00:15:59,981 --> 00:16:00,965
Fine.

294
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:02,656
Atta boy.

295
00:16:03,411 --> 00:16:05,130
- Good to see you.
- Same, Mal.

296
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,108
Look...

297
00:16:06,407 --> 00:16:08,533
I know you really shouldn't, but...

298
00:16:08,832 --> 00:16:10,218
it'd be good to know.

299
00:16:11,825 --> 00:16:15,042
Subdural hematoma. He crashed,
there was nothing we could do.

300
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:16,126
Thank you.

301
00:16:16,251 --> 00:16:19,386
And for the record,
you made him a better person.

302
00:16:20,676 --> 00:16:21,619
See yah.

303
00:16:23,193 --> 00:16:24,190
See yah.

304
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,667
Why do you have to aggravate
that poor girl?

305
00:16:26,792 --> 00:16:28,653
I wasn't aggravating anyone.

306
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,068
The cause of death was the brain
trauma sustained in the attack.

307
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:35,027
- What did you find out?
- The wife's a mess,

308
00:16:35,152 --> 00:16:37,287
the sister's a head case,
and there is cops everywhere.

309
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:40,700
Benny's going to be on the hook for
a manslaughter charge at the very least.

310
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,230
I'm thinking there is
a lot more than that going on.

311
00:16:43,356 --> 00:16:46,048
It's gotta be connected
to those drugs on the party boat.

312
00:16:46,933 --> 00:16:47,984
Now look.

313
00:16:49,983 --> 00:16:52,693
Nothing says home from the Alberta
like a cowboy hat, does it?

314
00:16:52,818 --> 00:16:54,596
- What do think of that?
- Interesting.

315
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:58,016
That other DJ from the boat said Brian
had some troubles back in Alberta.

316
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,429
Maybe those troubles
came home to find him.

317
00:17:00,554 --> 00:17:02,706
I'll take a snap, e-mail it to Rose.

318
00:17:02,831 --> 00:17:04,760
She can run a dmv check for us.

319
00:17:04,885 --> 00:17:05,747
Okay.

320
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:08,193
Hey, Tinny, how's school?

321
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,321
- Fine.
- Good.

322
00:17:12,261 --> 00:17:15,204
Anything new going on?
Anything cool?

323
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,108
- Cool?
- Yeah.

324
00:17:17,233 --> 00:17:18,221
No.

325
00:17:18,842 --> 00:17:21,204
Okay good. Listen, Tinny,

326
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:25,445
I know it's a bit of an adjustment, you
moving in with me and your grandfather.

327
00:17:26,467 --> 00:17:28,123
You probably think
we're a bit weird.

328
00:17:28,269 --> 00:17:31,230
But... I just want you to know
that I'm here for you

329
00:17:31,355 --> 00:17:34,226
and, you know, your mum's away
and everything and...

330
00:17:34,495 --> 00:17:36,618
you can talk... to me.

331
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:40,884
Okay. If you can't hear me,
I might as well be straight with you.

332
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:44,560
I didn't move into this house expecting
to babysit a 16 year old brat.

333
00:17:44,685 --> 00:17:46,776
So keep it up with the attitude.

334
00:17:46,901 --> 00:17:50,235
One night I'll sneak into your room
and ring your bloody neck.

335
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,195
It wasn't turned on yet.

336
00:17:54,917 --> 00:17:55,780
Good.

337
00:17:56,694 --> 00:17:57,878
Brian is dead.

338
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,745
You're going to go for manslaughter.

339
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,074
He's dead? Are you sure?

340
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:05,890
- Yeah.
- You need another lawyer, son.

341
00:18:07,149 --> 00:18:09,421
You sure it was ecstasy you were
on that night?

342
00:18:09,624 --> 00:18:13,040
- You lecturing me on my drug use now?
- No, I'm not.

343
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,260
But no one does ecstasy
and kills a guy.

344
00:18:15,609 --> 00:18:17,462
Just stop with this now, okay?

345
00:18:18,457 --> 00:18:20,458
I got nothing else to say.
I told you already.

346
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:23,143
There's a lot of cops
at the hospital. Why?

347
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:25,517
We know there is more going on here
than this assault.

348
00:18:25,642 --> 00:18:26,494
Stop.

349
00:18:27,281 --> 00:18:28,469
Just stop it.

350
00:18:29,069 --> 00:18:30,275
Who are these guys?

351
00:18:30,517 --> 00:18:31,863
Who are they? Benny.

352
00:18:31,988 --> 00:18:33,990
- I don't know.
- Are they connected?

353
00:18:35,123 --> 00:18:36,499
Are they connected?!

354
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,909
I am going to find out
what's going on.

355
00:18:42,034 --> 00:18:44,030
I just hope
it's not too late when I do.

356
00:18:50,628 --> 00:18:53,955
You only get one second with this
sign-in book. I could get into trouble.

357
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,144
- Thanks, Reg.
- Yeah, we appreciate it, buddy.

358
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:58,829
Hey. Nobody knows about this,
got me?

359
00:18:58,954 --> 00:19:00,549
- Malachy?
- Okay, Reg.

360
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:04,885
You think Benny's scared?
Someone trying to threaten him?

361
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:08,112
What? The cowboys?
Let's see if they've paid him a visit.

362
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:12,292
Laura Dawe, Brian's sister-in-law
is visiting Benny in jail.

363
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:14,975
- You sure?
- Yes, that's her name right there. See?

364
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,489
Reading, it's a marvelous thing.
Should try it some time.

365
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:23,930
Could we have a look
at the surveillance footage?

366
00:19:24,055 --> 00:19:25,288
For this day.

367
00:19:25,691 --> 00:19:27,165
What are you, on glue?

368
00:19:28,154 --> 00:19:29,257
Maybe not.

369
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:30,835
Thanks for your help.

370
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:34,047
Doyle, next time I see you at
the goulds track, walk the other way.

371
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:37,410
I'll be walking... the other... way.

372
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:41,402
Why would Laura be coming to visit
the guy who killed her sister's husband?

373
00:19:41,527 --> 00:19:43,179
I don't know, lets go ask her.

374
00:19:44,253 --> 00:19:45,365
See you, Reg.

375
00:19:52,719 --> 00:19:53,881
Shall we?

376
00:19:54,127 --> 00:19:55,387
Might as well.

377
00:19:55,984 --> 00:19:56,909
Hello?

378
00:19:58,039 --> 00:19:59,055
Laura?

379
00:20:01,246 --> 00:20:02,394
Laura Dawe?

380
00:20:06,628 --> 00:20:08,774
I love what she's done
with the place.

381
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,189
Unless we find a dead
cleaning lady somewhere in here,

382
00:20:12,314 --> 00:20:14,462
I'd say
this looks pretty suspicious.

383
00:20:15,335 --> 00:20:18,258
There is an astute
observation there, Banachek.

384
00:20:18,564 --> 00:20:19,965
Oh, look at this.

385
00:20:20,994 --> 00:20:23,549
What do you think?
Using the scale for baking?

386
00:20:24,241 --> 00:20:25,905
Big doubters there.

387
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,833
Looks to me...

388
00:20:27,975 --> 00:20:31,705
like Brian and Laura are supplying
the boat and the party.

389
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,504
I'll go have a look around.

390
00:20:33,986 --> 00:20:35,327
You do that.

391
00:20:36,648 --> 00:20:39,422
Yeah, there's coke
in this, dad, for sure.

392
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,101
Big Gym.

393
00:20:46,909 --> 00:20:48,797
Well, you could lift Brian.

394
00:20:50,742 --> 00:20:51,865
Dad?

395
00:20:53,976 --> 00:20:56,412
- What happened?
- He went through the window.

396
00:20:57,465 --> 00:21:00,374
Was he like a... a bearded guy?
Cowboy looking fella?

397
00:21:00,499 --> 00:21:02,290
It's not like
he was wearing the hat.

398
00:21:02,415 --> 00:21:04,471
- Do you want my help?
- I'd rather crawl.

399
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:08,593
- What the hell are you doing?!
- He's fallen and he can't get up.

400
00:21:16,259 --> 00:21:17,674
{pub}I'm calling the police.

401
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:20,260
You don't have to be at that.
Hold on.

402
00:21:20,385 --> 00:21:22,488
No, go right ahead. Call 'em.

403
00:21:23,034 --> 00:21:25,754
Somebody feng shui-ed
this place pretty good, right?

404
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,032
Something to do
with the party favours?

405
00:21:28,168 --> 00:21:30,592
You and Brian have been selling
some coke on that boat.

406
00:21:30,717 --> 00:21:33,958
I'll take pictures, you call the cops,
they'll straighten the whole thing out.

407
00:21:36,056 --> 00:21:39,048
The only people I see here are you two.
For all I know, you trashed the place.

408
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:42,091
If you really thought that,
you would be calling the cops right now.

409
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:46,351
I'm Malachy Doyle. I'm a private
detective and this is my son, Jake.

410
00:21:46,476 --> 00:21:47,221
We met.

411
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:51,309
We're investigating Brian Harris' death
and your door was open.

412
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:52,527
That's right.

413
00:21:52,652 --> 00:21:54,771
Why were you visiting
Benny Natche in prison?

414
00:21:54,962 --> 00:21:57,120
- What?
- It just seems odd you would visit him

415
00:21:57,245 --> 00:22:00,207
after he put your business partner
and brother-in-law in hospital.

416
00:22:00,332 --> 00:22:02,557
Was Benny trying to protect
you for something?

417
00:22:02,682 --> 00:22:04,621
Maybe because
you're involved horizontally?

418
00:22:04,746 --> 00:22:06,572
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

419
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:10,121
He's looking at a murder charge
yet refuses to defend himself.

420
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:12,370
That's your signature, right?

421
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:14,859
Come have a look, please.

422
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,426
We took this from the log book
at the prison. Look familiar?

423
00:22:22,085 --> 00:22:23,320
He works for me.

424
00:22:23,982 --> 00:22:25,645
So I owe him at least a visit.

425
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:29,237
Conjugal... visit? I don't care
if you were sleeping with Benny,

426
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:32,385
- but why are you trying to hide it?
- Brian was a jerk.

427
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:35,173
He ran the business up his nose
and down into the ground.

428
00:22:35,429 --> 00:22:38,229
I didn't know that people coming
to see Benny was the only thing

429
00:22:38,354 --> 00:22:41,905
keeping us afloat for months.
So, I was just trying to be kind.

430
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:44,234
Benny knows what he did.

431
00:22:45,009 --> 00:22:47,782
Now, if you'll excuse me,
my little sister's burying her husband.

432
00:22:50,363 --> 00:22:51,574
So get out.

433
00:22:51,842 --> 00:22:52,652
Now!

434
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,581
Come on.

435
00:23:00,939 --> 00:23:02,619
Wow, this must be fate.

436
00:23:03,211 --> 00:23:04,714
Are you following me now?

437
00:23:04,959 --> 00:23:07,476
Please, I just need
ten minutes of your time.

438
00:23:07,601 --> 00:23:09,459
Let me buy you some chips?

439
00:23:10,254 --> 00:23:11,931
Can we get two chips, please?

440
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,142
We think Benny

441
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,824
was having
an affair with Laura Dawe,

442
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:20,201
Brian Harris' sister-in-law.

443
00:23:20,326 --> 00:23:22,560
She is also co-owner
of the party boat.

444
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:27,811
You got any signs of her when you were
investigating your drug sting thingy?

445
00:23:28,593 --> 00:23:32,118
- What drug sting thingy?
- What drug sting thingy? C'mon!

446
00:23:32,761 --> 00:23:34,197
Look at these two guys.

447
00:23:35,341 --> 00:23:36,506
Look familiar?

448
00:23:36,953 --> 00:23:39,511
Cowboy friends there?
I did some research.

449
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,367
Travis Lee and Jason Ward.

450
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:46,283
Both these guys were working
with Brian in Alberta

451
00:23:46,408 --> 00:23:49,469
and both have rap sheets
for drug possession.

452
00:23:49,749 --> 00:23:51,406
What is your point, Mr. Doyle?

453
00:23:52,878 --> 00:23:54,891
Would you please call me Jake?
Seriously.

454
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:57,752
My point is...

455
00:23:58,467 --> 00:24:01,880
I know you were investigating Brian
before he got his head bashed in.

456
00:24:02,176 --> 00:24:04,402
And I think these guys
are connected somehow.

457
00:24:10,218 --> 00:24:13,201
My niece... she likes
to re-program...

458
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:14,464
my ring tones.

459
00:24:15,192 --> 00:24:17,755
- Cute.
- Yeah, she'll be dead soon.

460
00:24:18,145 --> 00:24:21,584
Look, I need to know, is Benny
hooked up in any of this or not?

461
00:24:21,709 --> 00:24:22,543
Please?

462
00:24:24,812 --> 00:24:27,090
Your friend Benny was covered
in Brian Harris' blood.

463
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:29,133
He was holding
the weapon in his hands.

464
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:32,966
But as far as I know, he has nothing
to do with any drugs or Alberta.

465
00:24:34,154 --> 00:24:35,014
Seriously?

466
00:24:36,746 --> 00:24:38,699
- Thank you.
- For what?

467
00:24:38,824 --> 00:24:40,710
He's a very close friend of mine,

468
00:24:41,124 --> 00:24:42,522
and I appreciate this.

469
00:24:44,868 --> 00:24:45,775
Thanks.

470
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,987
I talked with my contact at the pen.

471
00:24:53,112 --> 00:24:55,900
He was able to lift
this surveillance photo

472
00:24:56,025 --> 00:24:58,399
of Laura signing in.
That's her, all-right.

473
00:24:59,369 --> 00:25:00,549
Contact?

474
00:25:01,022 --> 00:25:02,917
I'm not the only one
with connections.

475
00:25:03,117 --> 00:25:05,624
- How come there is no sound?
- It isn't satellite TV.

476
00:25:05,749 --> 00:25:08,840
"Laura, it's the only way.
It's the least he owes us."

477
00:25:09,898 --> 00:25:11,022
That's it.

478
00:25:12,574 --> 00:25:14,354
Where did you learn to read lips?

479
00:25:15,104 --> 00:25:16,641
I got my own mystery.

480
00:25:30,066 --> 00:25:30,983
Sorry.

481
00:25:31,967 --> 00:25:32,778
Sorry.

482
00:25:41,295 --> 00:25:43,458
How did Jake Doyle know about
these guys before us?

483
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:44,750
He has his ways.

484
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:48,262
We've been working this party boat
for weeks, trying to find Laura Dawe

485
00:25:48,387 --> 00:25:49,841
and Brian Harris' suppliers.

486
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:52,473
And a P.I. shows up
and knows all about it?

487
00:25:52,598 --> 00:25:53,981
I didn't say a word.

488
00:25:54,703 --> 00:25:56,867
What's his deal anyway?
Is he gonna be a problem?

489
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:59,098
Nah. He was a cop back in the day.

490
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,975
Uniform didn't fit, I don't think.

491
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:18,427
Hey there!

492
00:26:18,764 --> 00:26:20,432
Anybody selling any drugs?

493
00:26:20,757 --> 00:26:23,497
<i>Howdy, just looking for some drugs.</i>

494
00:26:23,622 --> 00:26:26,021
You have got to be kidding me?
What is he doing here?

495
00:26:26,146 --> 00:26:28,763
What do you want to do?
Looks like the cowboys are bailing.

496
00:26:28,888 --> 00:26:31,756
Let's go, now.
Everybody move in now!

497
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,409
Sorry. Excuse me.

498
00:26:40,534 --> 00:26:42,379
Uncle Jake, what are you doing here?

499
00:26:42,504 --> 00:26:44,268
What are you doing here, young lady?

500
00:26:44,592 --> 00:26:46,986
- "Young lady?"
- Yes, yeah. Young lady.

501
00:26:47,111 --> 00:26:48,731
You want something, old man?

502
00:26:48,856 --> 00:26:51,916
Not a good time
to go full plumage, kid.

503
00:26:56,243 --> 00:26:57,932
Nobody leaves this boat.

504
00:26:59,566 --> 00:27:01,467
Don't move, stay where you are.

505
00:27:07,009 --> 00:27:09,765
{pub}Not great with the third
impressions, are we, Jake?

506
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:13,261
If you told me you were gonna be here,
maybe I wouldn't have come.

507
00:27:13,386 --> 00:27:16,295
"Told you?" You're a private detective.
Why would I tell you anything?

508
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,477
We had a very high-risk op. planned.

509
00:27:18,602 --> 00:27:20,307
Yeah, I know. I know you wanted

510
00:27:20,432 --> 00:27:22,848
to pick them up on possession.
They didn't have the drugs on them.

511
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:24,334
How do you know that?

512
00:27:24,501 --> 00:27:26,269
Did you find any drugs on them?

513
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,925
- I didn't do anything wrong.
- Stay out of my way

514
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:30,778
or I will put you in jail.

515
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,202
That's a little excessive,
Constable. But...

516
00:27:40,818 --> 00:27:42,354
Man, she needs to get laid.

517
00:27:42,479 --> 00:27:45,413
You don't even start with me, niece.

518
00:27:56,658 --> 00:27:57,741
Jake?

519
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:01,887
Jake, hey?

520
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,746
- Don't you have to get up?
- No.

521
00:28:06,187 --> 00:28:08,939
Yeah, honey,
you have a lawyer thing.

522
00:28:09,719 --> 00:28:13,021
You know, your divorce,
your ex-wife?

523
00:28:14,703 --> 00:28:15,768
Oh, no...

524
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:29,072
Sorry.

525
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,599
Sorry I'm late.

526
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:35,463
- You look great.
- You look like crap.

527
00:28:35,959 --> 00:28:38,242
Shall we proceed?
My client is willing to negotiate

528
00:28:38,367 --> 00:28:39,925
an even split regarding the home.

529
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:43,271
Due to the obvious market increase,
there will be a profit for both parties.

530
00:28:43,396 --> 00:28:46,100
We agree in principle,
but we're gonna detail in long form.

531
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:48,368
All furniture
should be divided equally,

532
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:50,483
except the large
flat screen television...

533
00:28:50,608 --> 00:28:52,921
No, no. That's mine.
You know that's mine.

534
00:28:53,046 --> 00:28:55,115
- We have a list of demands.
- "Demands?"

535
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,319
- Please. My client...
- Hey, don't try it. It's mine.

536
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:01,344
My client will allow your client

537
00:29:01,469 --> 00:29:03,756
to keep the flat screen television.

538
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,368
What?

539
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:07,789
Why?

540
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:10,740
- Are you joking?
- You know what? I don't want the TV.

541
00:29:10,865 --> 00:29:13,471
Stop! Stop being so childish.

542
00:29:13,596 --> 00:29:15,116
No, no. I know doing here.

543
00:29:15,241 --> 00:29:17,308
You're putting on
this manipulative spin crap.

544
00:29:17,433 --> 00:29:19,590
She's trying to be a martyr.
Aren't you, Nikki?

545
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,568
- It's not gonna work.
- Do you hear this?

546
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:22,790
A year of this!

547
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:25,462
Do I understand that your client
refuses to take the TV?

548
00:29:25,587 --> 00:29:27,598
- Oh no, he's taking it.
- Nikki, please.

549
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,101
You want me to take it?

550
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:31,538
I'll take it under one condition.

551
00:29:31,663 --> 00:29:33,527
Jake, you wanna let me handle this?

552
00:29:33,652 --> 00:29:36,315
Shut up, Walter. What condition?

553
00:29:36,487 --> 00:29:38,933
We stay the hell away
from one another for ever and ever.

554
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:42,495
You are such a bastard!

555
00:29:43,245 --> 00:29:44,715
We made a promise!

556
00:29:45,175 --> 00:29:47,643
We made a promise
in front of God, Jake!

557
00:29:47,768 --> 00:29:48,957
Did you forget that!?

558
00:29:49,082 --> 00:29:50,839
Yes! Because we were drunk!

559
00:29:50,964 --> 00:29:52,882
Lets just all try and calm down!

560
00:29:53,007 --> 00:29:56,542
Walter, can you please deal
with this! Get me a restraining order.

561
00:29:56,667 --> 00:29:58,577
That's what I want.
A restraining order.

562
00:30:00,176 --> 00:30:01,048
Crazy!

563
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:09,682
Oh my God, what do you want me to do?
Wash my eyes out with acid?

564
00:30:10,132 --> 00:30:11,100
How'd it go?

565
00:30:12,432 --> 00:30:16,118
It went good. I think
we're making some good progress.

566
00:30:16,417 --> 00:30:18,649
Well, we've been doing
a some thinking.

567
00:30:19,009 --> 00:30:21,902
I can see you're thinking
all over your old man lips there.

568
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,553
We were thinking that it's clear Laura
and Theresa are holding back on us.

569
00:30:25,678 --> 00:30:28,784
Someone trashed the place, which means
they have something someone wants.

570
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:31,532
But what that something is,
we have no idea.

571
00:30:31,657 --> 00:30:33,826
Whoever trashed the place,
they didn't found it.

572
00:30:33,951 --> 00:30:37,918
Plus, you seem to have ruined whatever
was going down on that boat, Bozo.

573
00:30:38,388 --> 00:30:41,547
What can I say?
Trouble just has a way of finding me.

574
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:43,340
I think it's the other way around.

575
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,637
Whatever. They need
to make another exchange.

576
00:30:45,762 --> 00:30:48,179
- We need to find a way to get in on it.
- But how?

577
00:31:03,327 --> 00:31:05,470
See? Nothing says desperation

578
00:31:05,595 --> 00:31:07,902
like a really hot girl
drinking alone at a bar.

579
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,218
My God.
Are you hitting on me now?

580
00:31:10,343 --> 00:31:13,162
I can if you want me to. Please
don't tell me you're gonna mace me?

581
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:14,474
Check, please!

582
00:31:16,769 --> 00:31:18,040
Your brother in-law,

583
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,344
your boyfriend in jail,

584
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:22,732
two cowboys.

585
00:31:25,287 --> 00:31:27,343
That's some load of men
to have in your life.

586
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:29,136
Don't know
what you're talking about.

587
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,686
These are the two guys
that broke into your apartment.

588
00:31:31,811 --> 00:31:34,633
They were looking for something and
didn't find it cause I interrupted them.

589
00:31:34,758 --> 00:31:37,353
- Okay, you're outta your mind.
- I don't think so.

590
00:31:37,547 --> 00:31:39,968
See, I think this has something
to do with drugs.

591
00:31:40,093 --> 00:31:43,652
Whatever it was, you were trying to
exchange it with them on the boat.

592
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:47,029
How do you know that?
Are you spying on me?

593
00:31:48,101 --> 00:31:49,432
Day and night.

594
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,432
Seeing how this is
like our first date,

595
00:31:53,557 --> 00:31:56,014
you should let me get that,
you could get the movie.

596
00:31:56,139 --> 00:31:59,297
I wouldn't let you buy me a drink
if you were the last dick on earth.

597
00:32:01,467 --> 00:32:03,346
Leave me and my sister alone.

598
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,338
- Jake Doyle?
- Yeah?

599
00:32:07,463 --> 00:32:10,386
Peace Bond. From your wife.
You've been served. Have a nice day.

600
00:32:11,976 --> 00:32:14,890
Peace Bond? What is that,
like a restraining order?

601
00:32:17,046 --> 00:32:18,565
Hurry up, we gotta plant this bug.

602
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:21,209
- You should talk to her.
- I am not allowed to talk to her.

603
00:32:21,334 --> 00:32:22,514
It's the whole point.

604
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:25,692
I mean I can scream at her from a
hundred yards if that's what you want.

605
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:28,654
These things are pretty cheap these
days. You could buy a new ones.

606
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:31,068
- These work fine.
- They work fine?

607
00:32:31,193 --> 00:32:34,244
Just like the last one you planted.
Remember how it didn't work

608
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,745
except for the 15 minutes
of polka-dot door we picked up.

609
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:38,347
That's a good show.

610
00:32:41,161 --> 00:32:44,503
Rose thinks I should let you
plant these from now on. Here.

611
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:47,611
You know, that Rose, I always knew
that she had great taste.

612
00:32:47,736 --> 00:32:49,783
Except for men. She doesn't have
great taste in men.

613
00:32:49,908 --> 00:32:51,681
- Meaning you.
- Watch your mouth.

614
00:32:54,161 --> 00:32:55,742
That's the love of my life.

615
00:33:24,467 --> 00:33:26,625
- Got it.
- Hello, ladies.

616
00:33:32,535 --> 00:33:33,663
Saddle up.

617
00:33:44,757 --> 00:33:47,216
{pub}Morning, sunshine.
Well, it's not really morning,

618
00:33:47,341 --> 00:33:49,822
- more like afternoon.
- Let me out of here man.

619
00:33:49,947 --> 00:33:53,782
Are you the fellows that are responsible
for my buddy Benny ending up in jail?

620
00:33:55,238 --> 00:33:56,919
Number thirty-five.

621
00:33:57,370 --> 00:34:00,139
Hey, what's that for?
What's that all about?

622
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,378
Let me up.

623
00:34:04,427 --> 00:34:08,360
What's the key for, Tra... Are you...
No, you must be Travis, right?

624
00:34:08,485 --> 00:34:11,268
You're Travis. What's the key for,
buddy? You better tell me.

625
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:19,957
You're wondering if I will actually
do it? Let me tell you something.

626
00:34:20,082 --> 00:34:22,944
Benny is one of my best friends,
in fact he is almost family.

627
00:34:23,069 --> 00:34:25,213
And if you're responsible
for him being in jail,

628
00:34:25,338 --> 00:34:28,941
- yes, you better believe I'll do it.
- Man what are you talking about?!

629
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:33,288
Drug deal with Brian,
you wanted to cut him out maybe?

630
00:34:33,413 --> 00:34:35,420
Let Benny take the fall?
Something like that?

631
00:34:35,545 --> 00:34:39,228
Are you nuts! Brian dying is like
the worst this that could have happened.

632
00:34:39,353 --> 00:34:41,412
Now I gotta deal
with this Laura cow.

633
00:34:41,592 --> 00:34:44,957
- Sure about that?
- If I see you again, you're a dead man!

634
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:47,191
See, that's the kind
of stuff you say to a guy

635
00:34:47,316 --> 00:34:49,753
when you're not about
to be electrocuted in a bathtub.

636
00:34:50,864 --> 00:34:52,508
What's your problem with Laura?

637
00:34:52,633 --> 00:34:55,457
We had a deal for some coke,
I gave Brian the money

638
00:34:55,582 --> 00:34:59,567
and he dies before we can get it. I know
it is supposed to be in a gym locker!

639
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:01,179
- You sure?
- Yes!

640
00:35:01,304 --> 00:35:03,016
- You telling the truth?
- Yes!

641
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,284
You better be.

642
00:35:05,163 --> 00:35:06,747
I don't want your money pal

643
00:35:06,872 --> 00:35:08,461
and I don't want your drugs.

644
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:11,108
But if I find out
you're the reason Benny is in jail...

645
00:35:13,131 --> 00:35:14,528
Have a nice day.

646
00:35:18,765 --> 00:35:22,737
Now you and your BFF,
can ride off into the sunset together.

647
00:35:32,955 --> 00:35:34,465
Hey! You looking for me?

648
00:35:34,738 --> 00:35:37,479
Brian Harris got my son into drugs.
That's why I did it.

649
00:35:37,604 --> 00:35:41,114
I killed him. Arrest me.
I killed Brian Harris.

650
00:35:45,068 --> 00:35:46,952
Dr. Natche is sticking
to his confession,

651
00:35:47,077 --> 00:35:49,503
they're holding him
pending further investigation.

652
00:35:49,628 --> 00:35:52,975
- This doesn't make any sense.
- I know, but when it comes to family,

653
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,896
it doesn't have to make sense.
A father will do anything for his kids.

654
00:35:56,021 --> 00:35:59,004
- Oh yeah? Would you die for me?
- No.

655
00:35:59,129 --> 00:36:00,945
- Take a bullet for me?
- No.

656
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:03,347
- Go to jail for me then?
- God, no.

657
00:36:03,472 --> 00:36:05,622
It's a full time job
trying to keep you out of there.

658
00:36:13,428 --> 00:36:15,467
- It's your father.
- He's in jail.

659
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,667
- What? What for?
- Right now?

660
00:36:18,087 --> 00:36:20,870
Creating a disturbance,
and public intoxication.

661
00:36:20,995 --> 00:36:23,364
But if it's up to him, by evening
it'll be in for manslaughter

662
00:36:23,489 --> 00:36:25,262
cause he confessed
to Brian's murder.

663
00:36:25,387 --> 00:36:28,185
- He wasn't even there.
- It's funny how people would do that.

664
00:36:28,422 --> 00:36:30,352
Take the rap
for something they didn't do.

665
00:36:30,477 --> 00:36:32,199
The apple doesn't fall far.

666
00:36:32,324 --> 00:36:33,998
Do your remember when we were kids?

667
00:36:34,123 --> 00:36:36,318
Every time we got into trouble,
you always took the rap.

668
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:37,823
What did I tell you? Don't...

669
00:36:37,948 --> 00:36:40,364
We know Laura came to visit you,
Benny, we know that.

670
00:36:41,486 --> 00:36:42,990
She did, didn't she?

671
00:36:43,285 --> 00:36:45,482
You rolled over, just like always.

672
00:36:45,607 --> 00:36:46,870
But if she killed him...

673
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,877
- We gotta get dad out.
- We can't.

674
00:36:49,002 --> 00:36:50,463
Only you can do that.

675
00:36:51,715 --> 00:36:55,087
Benny, you gotta think about your family
and what you're doing to them.

676
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:57,026
I am thinking about my family.

677
00:36:57,616 --> 00:36:58,612
Guard?

678
00:37:00,508 --> 00:37:03,428
- Guard, I want to make a statement.
- What are you doing?

679
00:37:04,106 --> 00:37:05,778
I killed Brian Harris

680
00:37:05,978 --> 00:37:07,901
and I want to sign a confession.

681
00:37:09,004 --> 00:37:09,946
Benny.

682
00:37:14,507 --> 00:37:15,631
What do we got?

683
00:37:15,821 --> 00:37:19,006
We got a locker full of drugs,
two cowboys, Benny in jail,

684
00:37:19,131 --> 00:37:21,279
a lying sister and a pregnant widow.

685
00:37:23,125 --> 00:37:25,760
- A pregnant widow.
- A pregnant widow!

686
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:28,681
All right. So we already know
that Benny is lying to us.

687
00:37:28,806 --> 00:37:30,080
We know that for sure.

688
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:33,333
And if a father, well most fathers
will do anything for his kids.

689
00:37:34,469 --> 00:37:36,837
- Benny's the father.
- Maybe Benny is the father.

690
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:38,622
Just give me you're camera.

691
00:37:38,899 --> 00:37:42,079
Find the picture from the sign in book
with Laura's signature in it.

692
00:37:42,204 --> 00:37:43,532
I got this in here.

693
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:47,053
- Here you go.
- Okay.

694
00:37:47,178 --> 00:37:49,349
This is Laura's real signature,
all right?

695
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,160
This is her signature
from the sign in book.

696
00:37:53,823 --> 00:37:55,480
- They don't match.
- They don't match.

697
00:37:56,502 --> 00:37:58,105
Oh, great. You two again.

698
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:00,035
Reg, buddy. Great to see you again.

699
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,912
Listen, I just need you
to answer one question.

700
00:38:04,871 --> 00:38:06,424
Which one of these girls

701
00:38:07,835 --> 00:38:09,286
was visiting Benny in prison?

702
00:38:09,645 --> 00:38:11,108
Look closely now.

703
00:38:13,276 --> 00:38:15,208
- That's her.
- You sure about that?

704
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,002
Her hair's brown now though.

705
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,450
Her hair is brown now.

706
00:38:20,142 --> 00:38:21,841
Brown like a wig maybe?

707
00:38:27,802 --> 00:38:30,637
- What the hell are you doing?
- Going on a trip, are we?

708
00:38:30,762 --> 00:38:33,851
While my childhood friend confesses
to a murder he didn't commit, nice.

709
00:38:33,976 --> 00:38:36,178
You might not want to carry
heavy items in your condition.

710
00:38:36,303 --> 00:38:38,205
- Theresa, don't.
- Where's the wig?

711
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,508
You like dressing up like
your sister when you go visit

712
00:38:40,633 --> 00:38:42,903
the father
of your unborn baby in prison?

713
00:38:43,105 --> 00:38:44,863
Benjamin is a good name for a boy.

714
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,256
Or is it a girl?

715
00:38:46,381 --> 00:38:48,543
It's gonna be nice
to have a doctor in the family.

716
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:49,717
What?

717
00:38:49,842 --> 00:38:52,239
Brian found out you were
carrying Benny's child.

718
00:38:52,364 --> 00:38:54,248
I guess he wasn't
too happy about it?

719
00:38:55,112 --> 00:38:57,064
- How do you know about...
- Shut up.

720
00:38:57,189 --> 00:38:58,380
Get out right now.

721
00:38:58,505 --> 00:39:00,691
Your husband was beating
the crap out of Benny,

722
00:39:00,816 --> 00:39:02,704
you grabbed something
you stopped him.

723
00:39:02,829 --> 00:39:05,053
Theresa, if Brian
was going to kill Benny,

724
00:39:05,178 --> 00:39:07,052
there are ways around this.
The law is the law.

725
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,429
- If you were protecting him.
- Don't listen to him.

726
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:12,849
- We know you never meant to kill Brian.
- There's no proof for any of this.

727
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,185
We're not listening to you,
cause you tells lies.

728
00:39:15,735 --> 00:39:18,725
I didn't mean for Benny to take
the blame for any of this, you know?

729
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:22,067
All the drug money in the world can
never get you far enough away from this.

730
00:39:25,314 --> 00:39:27,666
Theresa, you need to get a lawyer,

731
00:39:27,791 --> 00:39:30,367
and you have to come clean
with what you did.

732
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,772
You have to do the right thing here.

733
00:39:46,832 --> 00:39:48,844
- What's going on?
- It's going to be okay, Benny.

734
00:39:49,073 --> 00:39:50,309
We have a good lawyer.

735
00:39:50,434 --> 00:39:52,149
Theresa is going to be fine.

736
00:39:52,274 --> 00:39:54,324
Your child will be fine.

737
00:39:54,666 --> 00:39:56,564
We will do this together.

738
00:40:01,062 --> 00:40:03,228
I was talking to Walter,
they're gonna be laying charges.

739
00:40:03,353 --> 00:40:04,985
But it could go either way.

740
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:07,070
Lawful defense of a third party.

741
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:10,389
So there's a chance that Theresa
won't have to have her baby behind bars.

742
00:40:10,514 --> 00:40:12,276
Still a hell of a way
to start a family.

743
00:40:12,401 --> 00:40:14,546
If Benny had just approached
this calmly from the start,

744
00:40:14,671 --> 00:40:17,672
- they might never have happened.
- Yeah. True.

745
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:21,251
- There's a lesson for you in this, too.
- Is there really?

746
00:40:21,643 --> 00:40:23,355
- Calm.
- Calm?

747
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,697
- Yeah.
- That's the lesson?

748
00:40:25,822 --> 00:40:28,175
Listen, you wouldn't die for me,
would you?

749
00:40:29,058 --> 00:40:29,843
Nope.

750
00:40:30,236 --> 00:40:33,452
I've another son as well as a daughter,
which makes you expendable.

751
00:40:33,577 --> 00:40:36,219
You're the third born.
The runt of the litter.

752
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:39,557
The fatherly love from you is like one
of those Latter Day Saints Commercials.

753
00:40:39,682 --> 00:40:41,855
- So much compassion.
- Move out of my house!

754
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:43,952
I'll move out when
I'm good and ready.

755
00:40:44,077 --> 00:40:46,401
Lets go buddy. Bed time.

756
00:41:01,465 --> 00:41:02,558
Bingo.

757
00:41:13,758 --> 00:41:16,000
Yes, buddy. Like you would.

758
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,977
<i>- Doyle.</i>
- I got your little tip.

759
00:41:23,102 --> 00:41:25,050
<i>The drugs were in the locker,
just like you said.</i>

760
00:41:25,175 --> 00:41:27,182
Constable, it was my pleasure.

761
00:41:27,307 --> 00:41:29,782
I was just trying to atone
for the whole boat debacle.

762
00:41:29,907 --> 00:41:33,055
If you want, sometime,
I can really truly make it up to you.

763
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,990
We're even, I think.

764
00:41:35,861 --> 00:41:38,022
If you change your mind,
I'll be here all night.

765
00:41:38,147 --> 00:41:41,074
You're a cop, I'm pretty sure
you can figure out my address.

766
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,747
You never know.

767
00:41:44,285 --> 00:41:45,919
Night, Mr. Doyle.

768
00:41:46,192 --> 00:41:47,656
Night, Constable.

769
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:02,413
No way. She's here.

770
00:42:07,956 --> 00:42:09,769
What the hell are you doing here?

771
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:21,431
