I am such a fucking idiot. 

<SYNC Start=111676><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=112034><P Class=KRCC>
I should have dumped him years ago. 

<SYNC Start=113679><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, yeah! 

<SYNC Start=114346><P Class=KRCC>
I feel 20 pounds lighter. 

<SYNC Start=117347><P Class=KRCC>
More like 180 pounds. 

<SYNC Start=119614><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=121539><P Class=KRCC>
What do you think he's doing tonight? 

<SYNC Start=122984><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, he's fucking his old grad student, thinking he's king of the world. 

<SYNC Start=127302><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=128422><P Class=KRCC>
God, I wish I knew who invented Viagra...

<SYNC Start=131385><P Class=KRCC>
so I could shoot him. 

<SYNC Start=133516><P Class=KRCC>
I'll drink to that. 

<SYNC Start=135188><P Class=KRCC>
Shit, I got it on my shirt!

This is how you study for the funeral director's license? 

<SYNC Start=213630><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=214242><P Class=KRCC>
Now, you must really like wearing a suit. 

<SYNC Start=216470><P Class=KRCC>
There's always a chance we'll get a walk-in. 

<SYNC Start=218843><P Class=KRCC>
There's always a chance we might get abducted by aliens. 

<SYNC Start=221709><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=226876><P Class=KRCC>
What's the longest we've ever gone without a body? 

<SYNC Start=229229><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=230358><P Class=KRCC>
I remember Dad saying something like <BR>9 days during the '84 Olympics. 

<SYNC Start=233860><P Class=KRCC>
"The Drought of '84." 

<SYNC Start=235954><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=237075><P Class=KRCC>
You remember how Dad used to do Walter Brennan? 

<SYNC Start=239004><P Class=KRCC>
"Come on, Lil' Luke, let's stitch this dead guy up, 

<SYNC Start=241411><P Class=KRCC>
'cause Maw's made a mess of catfish,<BR> and I'm powerful hungry!" 

<SYNC Start=244882><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=247669><P Class=KRCC>
OK, well, thank you for making me feel like an idiot. 

<SYNC Start=249987><P Class=KRCC>
No, you just 

<SYNC Start=251993><P Class=KRCC>
knew a whole side of Dad I never did. 

<SYNC Start=254554><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=256495><P Class=KRCC>
9 days, huh? 

<SYNC Start=258195><P Class=KRCC>
This might beat that. 

<SYNC Start=260104><P Class=KRCC>
When a family places money in <BR>a funeral trust for a pre-need, 

<SYNC Start=263063><P Class=KRCC>
how much money can the funeral home use for purposes until the family requires your services? 

<SYNC Start=268346><P Class=KRCC>
50%.

<SYNC Start=269820><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=271582><P Class=KRCC>
25%. 

<SYNC Start=272416><P Class=KRCC>
Zero. 

<SYNC Start=273156><P Class=KRCC>
None. 

<SYNC Start=273974><P Class=KRCC>
I knew that. 

<SYNC Start=275378><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=278350><P Class=KRCC>
Hello? 

<SYNC Start=279075><P Class=KRCC>
Hey, it's me. 

<SYNC Start=280372><P Class=KRCC>
Well, it's about time! 

<SYNC Start=281801><P Class=KRCC>
I've only been calling you for 6 days straight. 

<SYNC Start=283557><P Class=KRCC>
Yeah, I've been incredibly busy. 

<SYNC Start=285221><P Class=KRCC>
Lots of new clients. 

<SYNC Start=286335><P Class=KRCC>
Sorry. 

<SYNC Start=286933><P Class=KRCC>
How's Billy? 

<SYNC Start=287890><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=288424><P Class=KRCC>
Uh--better. 

<SYNC Start=290113><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=290432><P Class=KRCC>
It only happens once a year, 

<SYNC Start=292374><P Class=KRCC>
you know. 

<SYNC Start=292819><P Class=KRCC>
Twice at the most. 

<SYNC Start=293963><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=294523><P Class=KRCC>
So when can I see you? 

<SYNC Start=296081><P Class=KRCC>
I don't know--

<SYNC Start=297280><P Class=KRCC>
Tuesday? 

<SYNC Start=298287><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=299769><P Class=KRCC>
Well, is he staying with you? 

<SYNC Start=300898><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=301359><P Class=KRCC>
Yeah, just for a few more days.

<SYNC Start=302705><P Class=KRCC>
Listen, I've gotta go. 

<SYNC Start=303687><P Class=KRCC>
I'll call you, OK? 

<SYNC Start=304829><P Class=KRCC>
I promise.

<SYNC Start=306085><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=309669><P Class=KRCC>
You think we're weird being undertakers' kids? 

<SYNC Start=311870><P Class=KRCC>
Just be thankful our parents weren't shrinks. 

<SYNC Start=314120><P Class=KRCC>
How many days does a family have to cancel a contract for services? 

<SYNC Start=317384><P Class=KRCC>
I'm so sick of this bizarre behavior that I'm supposed to figure out,<BR> and then she seems pissed off when I can't.

<SYNC Start=321591><P Class=KRCC>
It?s fuckin' neurotic. 

<SYNC Start=322355><P Class=KRCC>
Would you concentrate on this, please? 

<SYNC Start=324521><P Class=KRCC>
I need you to get your license so you can start handling your share of things.

<SYNC Start=327893><P Class=KRCC>
How many--

<SYNC Start=328402><P Class=KRCC>
3 days.

<SYNC Start=329957><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=331025><P Class=KRCC>
It's not exactly the LA Bar, David. 

<SYNC Start=333880><P Class=KRCC>
Come on, make me earn it. 

<SYNC Start=336215><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=336818><P Class=KRCC>
When a funeral home advertises their services, which 2 specific pieces of information are legally required on all advertisements? 

<SYNC Start=344347><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=352878><P Class=KRCC>
I'd start with some heavy-duty armature material and Plaster of Paris,

<SYNC Start=357166><P Class=KRCC>
mastic compound for her face, tissue builder and wax for her features. 

<SYNC Start=363539><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=364392><P Class=KRCC>
I'd finish her off with a good sealer. 

<SYNC Start=367079><P Class=KRCC>
She'll leak like a garden hose. 

<SYNC Start=369105><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=369590><P Class=KRCC>
A little airbrushing and a high quality foundation, and she's good to go.

<SYNC Start=373184><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=374872><P Class=KRCC>
How much time would you need? 

<SYNC Start=376385><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=377464><P Class=KRCC>
At least a day to do it right. 

<SYNC Start=379049><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=379953><P Class=KRCC>
The Fishers can spare you for a full day? 

<SYNC Start=382017><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=383079><P Class=KRCC>
I'm not auditioning for you. 

<SYNC Start=385177><P Class=KRCC>
This is a one-time freelance job, 

<SYNC Start=387221><P Class=KRCC>
and I use my own materials. 

<SYNC Start=388444><P Class=KRCC>
Kroehner's tecturizers--they blow. 

<SYNC Start=390165><P Class=KRCC>
How much? 

<SYNC Start=390956><P Class=KRCC>
1500. 

<SYNC Start=391998><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=393678><P Class=KRCC>
OK. 

<SYNC Start=395358><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=397337><P Class=KRCC>
For someone with your talent, that's a bargain. 

<SYNC Start=400943><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=401971><P Class=KRCC>
Stop blowing smoke up my ass. 

<SYNC Start=404689><P Class=KRCC>
I'm not quitting the Fishers. 

<SYNC Start=406929><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=408020><P Class=KRCC>
Mr. F. put me through school. 

<SYNC Start=409621><P Class=KRCC>
Have her done by 5...

<SYNC Start=411439><P Class=KRCC>
and she'd better look flawless.

<SYNC Start=413240><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=416920><P Class=KRCC>
Don't think about how steep it is. 

<SYNC Start=419478><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=420130><P Class=KRCC>
We've got 8 more miles.

and accepts it in ultimate humbleness."

<SYNC Start=434817><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=435296><P Class=KRCC>
Well, yeah, 

<SYNC Start=437990><P Class=KRCC>
Carlos Castenada can blow me. 

<SYNC Start=440286><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=441457><P Class=KRCC>
Tell me about it. 

<SYNC Start=442416><P Class=KRCC>
Where's the whole spiritual transcendence part from the brochure? 

<SYNC Start=445978><P Class=KRCC>
This is like fuckin' boot camp. 

<SYNC Start=447698><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=448376><P Class=KRCC>
Have I--Have 

<SYNC Start=449295><P Class=KRCC>
I, uh, thanked you for getting me high this morning? 

<SYNC Start=451309><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=451858><P Class=KRCC>
Like 12 times. 

<SYNC Start=453130><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=454413><P Class=KRCC>
Just making sure. 

<SYNC Start=455749><P Class=KRCC>
Claire, 

<SYNC Start=456633><P Class=KRCC>
Topher, 

<SYNC Start=458467><P Class=KRCC>
you're straggling! 

<SYNC Start=459671><P Class=KRCC>
You know the rules. 

<SYNC Start=460639><P Class=KRCC>
The group stays together. 

<SYNC Start=462888><P Class=KRCC>
Period. 

<SYNC Start=464182><P Class=KRCC>
Yavo, mein commandant! 

<SYNC Start=465909><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=469209><P Class=KRCC>
I've got a new way to make money. 

<SYNC Start=470964><P Class=KRCC>
We rent out the slumber room for meetings--

<SYNC Start=472552><P Class=KRCC>
12-step groups, that sort of thing. 

<SYNC Start=473940><P Class=KRCC>
Are you insane? 

<SYNC Start=475386><P Class=KRCC>
Drunks and drug addicts inside our home? 

<SYNC Start=477437><P Class=KRCC>
The insurance issues alone--

<SYNC Start=478712><P Class=KRCC>
Well, then, how about senior dance lessons? 

<SYNC Start=481133><P Class=KRCC>
Twice a week at 50 bucks a pop, that's 5200 a year. 

<SYNC Start=483765><P Class=KRCC>
That's 6 months property tax. 

<SYNC Start=485167><P Class=KRCC>
What if we've got a viewing? 

<SYNC Start=486897><P Class=KRCC>
They'll work around our schedule.

<SYNC Start=488062><P Class=KRCC>
David, these old people have nothing else to do. 

<SYNC Start=489713><P Class=KRCC>
They dance for twice a week, have fun. 

<SYNC Start=491305><P Class=KRCC>
Who do you think gets a call when they drop? 

<SYNC Start=492909><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=494454><P Class=KRCC>
That's actually not a bad idea. 

<SYNC Start=495931><P Class=KRCC>
Well, good, because they're coming here at 2, so

<SYNC Start=497890><P Class=KRCC>
no more comments about me not pulling my weight for a while, OK? 

<SYNC Start=501214><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=507973><P Class=KRCC>
Is this a new company policy?

<SYNC Start=509070><P Class=KRCC>
Casual Fridays? 

<SYNC Start=510136><P Class=KRCC>
Nice of you to drop by. 

<SYNC Start=511314><P Class=KRCC>
It's almost noon. 

<SYNC Start=512079><P Class=KRCC>
And I stayed till after 9 last night restocking and sterilizing. 

<SYNC Start=514985><P Class=KRCC>
You mean you didn't check? 

<SYNC Start=516410><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=516996><P Class=KRCC>
Look, if it's alright with you guys, I need the day off. 

<SYNC Start=519428><P Class=KRCC>
Vanessa's got an ultrasound. 

<SYNC Start=520824><P Class=KRCC>
She just had one last week. 

<SYNC Start=522238><P Class=KRCC>
Well, they want to do another one. 

<SYNC Start=525012><P Class=KRCC>
I think I should be there with her, don't you? 

<SYNC Start=526365><P Class=KRCC>
Well, of course. 

<SYNC Start=527031><P Class=KRCC>
You could have just called. 

<SYNC Start=527949><P Class=KRCC>
I left my jacket in the prep room. 

<SYNC Start=529702><P Class=KRCC>
It has my wallet, my insurance card, all that stuff. 

<SYNC Start=532198><P Class=KRCC>
Thanks, guys.

<SYNC Start=533080><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=535602><P Class=KRCC>
Great! Once again I'm the asshole, and you're the cool guy. 

<SYNC Start=538912><P Class=KRCC>
Well, you can tell him tomorrow that he's cleaning out the body fridge. 

<SYNC Start=541442><P Class=KRCC>
I want it scrubbed and hosed and disinfected. 

<SYNC Start=543366><P Class=KRCC>
You tell him. 

<SYNC Start=544126><P Class=KRCC>
It's Fisher & Sons. 

<SYNC Start=545618><P Class=KRCC>
Sometimes you have to be the bad cop. 

<SYNC Start=547229><P Class=KRCC>
But you're so good at it. 

<SYNC Start=548930><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=564135><P Class=KRCC>
Hey, Rico! 

<SYNC Start=564486><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=568347><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
Nate, 

<SYNC Start=569206><P Class=KRCC>
Please don't do that! 

<SYNC Start=571183><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=572065><P Class=KRCC>
I've got a lot on my mind, with the ultrasound and all. 

<SYNC Start=575189><P Class=KRCC>
David wants you to clean out--

<SYNC Start=576765><P Class=KRCC>
The body fridge. 

<SYNC Start=577397><P Class=KRCC>
I know. 

<SYNC Start=578053><P Class=KRCC>
I know your brother's got a bug up his ass about cleanliness. 

<SYNC Start=580528><P Class=KRCC>
I know. 

<SYNC Start=581707><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=582012><P Class=KRCC>
When we used to play G.I. 

<SYNC Start=582814><P Class=KRCC>
Joes, he always used to want to give his a shower. 

<SYNC Start=585068><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=587295><P Class=KRCC>
Yeah, well. 

<SYNC Start=588890><P Class=KRCC>
Running late. 

<SYNC Start=590359><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=590861><P Class=KRCC>
Where's your jacket? 

<SYNC Start=592400><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=593307><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, shit! 

<SYNC Start=595124><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=595906><P Class=KRCC>
I must have left it at home. 

<SYNC Start=597029><P Class=KRCC>
Oh. 

<SYNC Start=598078><P Class=KRCC>
Told you, man. 

<SYNC Start=598631><P Class=KRCC>
I've got a lot on my mind from the ultrasound. 

<SYNC Start=600780><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=601462><P Class=KRCC>
See ya.

<SYNC Start=602098><P Class=KRCC>
See ya. 

<SYNC Start=602905><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=611964><P Class=KRCC>
Now begins the vision quest part of our journey. 

<SYNC Start=614981><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, great, now we get to starve and sweat ourselves into a hallucinogenic state of ecstasy. 

<SYNC Start=619483><P Class=KRCC>
It's gonna get harder and harder for the next couple of days. 

<SYNC Start=622152><P Class=KRCC>
Now, you all know how tough physically. 

<SYNC Start=625209><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=626002><P Class=KRCC>
Now the mental challenges begin. OK? 

<SYNC Start=628776><P Class=KRCC>
Starting now, 

<SYNC Start=630056><P Class=KRCC>
you guys lead. 

<SYNC Start=631184><P Class=KRCC>
I just follow.

<SYNC Start=632411><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=633471><P Class=KRCC>
So, 

<SYNC Start=634600><P Class=KRCC>
I hope, for my sake, 

<SYNC Start=636169><P Class=KRCC>
you've all perfected your map and compass skills. 

<SYNC Start=639737><P Class=KRCC>
Parker. 

<SYNC Start=640557><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, God, not Parker! 

<SYNC Start=641961><P Class=KRCC>
Which way do we go? 

<SYNC Start=643240><P Class=KRCC>
Uh-

<SYNC Start=644745><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=647529><P Class=KRCC>
That way. 

<SYNC Start=649069><P Class=KRCC>
What are you waiting for? 

<SYNC Start=650674><P Class=KRCC>
You lead. 

<SYNC Start=651928><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=653327><P Class=KRCC>
Fuckin' girl scout! 

<SYNC Start=655011><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=665130><P Class=KRCC>
Good call, Parker! 

<SYNC Start=666271><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=666925><P Class=KRCC>
So who do you think plays Parker in the movie of her life? 

<SYNC Start=669769><P Class=KRCC>
Sandy Bullock or Julia Roberts? 

<SYNC Start=672153><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, please, she'd never rate that high. 

<SYNC Start=674216><P Class=KRCC>
She'd get one of those Buffy or Dawson's Creek chicks, tops! 

<SYNC Start=677868><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=680615><P Class=KRCC>
What is that? 

<SYNC Start=681932><P Class=KRCC>
This? 

<SYNC Start=683417><P Class=KRCC>
Inkali. 

<SYNC Start=684562><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=685688><P Class=KRCC>
It's like dumpling with spicy meat inside. 

<SYNC Start=690993><P Class=KRCC>
I cannot believe you never hear of Inkali! 

<SYNC Start=694701><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=695532><P Class=KRCC>
You know, 

<SYNC Start=696489><P Class=KRCC>
you need to go out from the house more. 

<SYNC Start=698248><P Class=KRCC>
I get out. 

<SYNC Start=699349><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=699575><P Class=KRCC>
I took a very enjoyable trip to San Bernadino just a few weeks ago. 

<SYNC Start=702927><P Class=KRCC>
You should come to my neighborhood. 

<SYNC Start=704705><P Class=KRCC>
All Russian. 

<SYNC Start=706307><P Class=KRCC>
You would love it. 

<SYNC Start=707693><P Class=KRCC>
People will passion, full of life. 

<SYNC Start=710085><P Class=KRCC>
Not like your family. 

<SYNC Start=711431><P Class=KRCC>
What do you mean? 

<SYNC Start=712550><P Class=KRCC>
Russians speak from here  

<SYNC Start=714009><P Class=KRCC>
from the heart, 

<SYNC Start=715008><P Class=KRCC>
with their souls, 

<SYNC Start=716558><P Class=KRCC>
not like Fisher, like from here like a little mouse goes

<SYNC Start=719554><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=720770><P Class=KRCC>
Not like that. 

<SYNC Start=721794><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=722897><P Class=KRCC>
If it's so wonderful in Russia, you should take the first flight back. 

<SYNC Start=726674><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=726984><P Class=KRCC>
In Russia, 

<SYNC Start=728122><P Class=KRCC>
I was engineer! 

<SYNC Start=729328><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=732001><P Class=KRCC>
Knock knock. 

<SYNC Start=733451><P Class=KRCC>
Hiram! 

<SYNC Start=734320><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=734657><P Class=KRCC>
I tried my hand at Jamaican Jerk Chicken, turned out good. 

<SYNC Start=736837><P Class=KRCC>
Thought you might like some for lunch.

<SYNC Start=738580><P Class=KRCC>
That's so thoughtful. 

<SYNC Start=740173><P Class=KRCC>
Thank you.

<SYNC Start=741032><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=744706><P Class=KRCC>
Hiram, this is my boss, Nikolai. 

<SYNC Start=747060><P Class=KRCC>
Hi. 

<SYNC Start=747987><P Class=KRCC>
She has a lunch. 

<SYNC Start=749184><P Class=KRCC>
Here, try some. 

<SYNC Start=749983><P Class=KRCC>
Please. 

<SYNC Start=750436><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=751460><P Class=KRCC>
You burned it! 

<SYNC Start=752842><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=752851><P Class=KRCC>
Nikolai! 

<SYNC Start=754576><P Class=KRCC>
Ruth is busy. 

<SYNC Start=755631><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=756683><P Class=KRCC>
I'm on my lunch break. 

<SYNC Start=758072><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=758417><P Class=KRCC>
Lunch is over! 

<SYNC Start=759916><P Class=KRCC>
Now we work!

<SYNC Start=761193><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=766316><P Class=KRCC>
Sorry I got you in trouble with your boss.

<SYNC Start=768529><P Class=KRCC>
Don't you worry. I can handle him. 

<SYNC Start=770970><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=781388><P Class=KRCC>
Everybody ready? 

<SYNC Start=783332><P Class=KRCC>
And round and left. 

<SYNC Start=784710><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=785799><P Class=KRCC>
Right. 

<SYNC Start=786209><P Class=KRCC>
Left. 
<SYNC Start=787637><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=788736><P Class=KRCC>
Good! 

<SYNC Start=789217><P Class=KRCC>
Good, 

<SYNC Start=790318><P Class=KRCC>
swing your partners! 

<SYNC Start=792002><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=795525><P Class=KRCC>
And promenade home! 

<SYNC Start=797716><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=798258><P Class=KRCC>
Very good! 

<SYNC Start=799539><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=800626><P Class=KRCC>
Hey, Vanessa. 

<SYNC Start=801960><P Class=KRCC>
Is Rico there? 

<SYNC Start=802899><P Class=KRCC>
No. Should I page him? 

<SYNC Start=803949><P Class=KRCC>
No, 

<SYNC Start=804313><P Class=KRCC>
no, it's nothing important. 

<SYNC Start=805269><P Class=KRCC>
I just wanted to run something by him. 

<SYNC Start=806639><P Class=KRCC>
OK. 

<SYNC Start=807520><P Class=KRCC>
Hey, did you have your ultrasound already? 

<SYNC Start=809155><P Class=KRCC>
Yeah. 

<SYNC Start=809871><P Class=KRCC>
Last week. 

<SYNC Start=811260><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=811994><P Class=KRCC>
You're not having one today? 

<SYNC Start=814011><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=815097><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, yeah, 

<SYNC Start=816572><P Class=KRCC>
yeah, but not till this afternoon. 

<SYNC Start=819111><P Class=KRCC>
Huh. 

<SYNC Start=820119><P Class=KRCC>
I'm sorry, Nate, but the UPS guy's at the door. 

<SYNC Start=822853><P Class=KRCC>
I gotta go, and I'll tell Rico you called, OK? 

<SYNC Start=825305><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=826033><P Class=KRCC>
Shit! 

<SYNC Start=827327><P Class=KRCC>
Shit! 

<SYNC Start=828516><P Class=KRCC>
Hey, 

<SYNC Start=829754><P Class=KRCC>
don't say that, papito, that's a grown-up word. 

<SYNC Start=833431><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=846603><P Class=KRCC>
OK, very good!

<SYNC Start=847722><P Class=KRCC>
Very good, ladies and gentlemen. 

<SYNC Start=849023><P Class=KRCC>
Now, if I could just have your attention, please, for just one second. 

<SYNC Start=851578><P Class=KRCC>
I want to teach you a new figure for the repertoire. 

<SYNC Start=853818><P Class=KRCC>
You're gonna love it, 

<SYNC Start=854551><P Class=KRCC>
your friends are gonna be very impressed, 

<SYNC Start=856549><P Class=KRCC>
I promise. 

<SYNC Start=857247><P Class=KRCC>
It's called the Hungarian Swing, and I need a volunteer,

<SYNC Start=860885><P Class=KRCC>
so if I could just borrow you for one second. 

<SYNC Start=864050><P Class=KRCC>
I promise, it won't hurt a bit. 

<SYNC Start=866060><P Class=KRCC>
It goes like this.

<SYNC Start=867181><P Class=KRCC>
You're gonna stand right hip to right hip, 

<SYNC Start=871000><P Class=KRCC>
your other hand is gonna go up on your partner's waist, 

<SYNC Start=873941><P Class=KRCC>
and your left hand is gonna go up over the head. 

<SYNC Start=876058><P Class=KRCC>
Now, you're gonna swing 

<SYNC Start=878076><P Class=KRCC>
one and a half times, 

<SYNC Start=880202><P Class=KRCC>
she will turn 

<SYNC Start=881196><P Class=KRCC>
one and a half times

<SYNC Start=882174><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=882926><P Class=KRCC>
into the promenade position. 

<SYNC Start=885414><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=885779><P Class=KRCC>
That wasn't so bad, was it? 

<SYNC Start=887306><P Class=KRCC>
Let's do it again, with the music. OK? 

<SYNC Start=889475><P Class=KRCC>
Uh, not so fast. 

<SYNC Start=890933><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=891921><P Class=KRCC>
OK, ladies and gentlemen, 

<SYNC Start=893383><P Class=KRCC>
with the music. 

<SYNC Start=894486><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=895032><P Class=KRCC>
Here we go, 

<SYNC Start=896154><P Class=KRCC>
OK, 

<SYNC Start=896939><P Class=KRCC>
and 1-

<SYNC Start=897322><P Class=KRCC>
2-

<SYNC Start=897828><P Class=KRCC>
3-

<SYNC Start=898329><P Class=KRCC>
4.

<SYNC Start=899464><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=911758><P Class=KRCC>
Kiss him! 

<SYNC Start=913192><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=927095><P Class=KRCC>
Interesting technique. 

<SYNC Start=928104><P Class=KRCC>
Where'd you train? 

<SYNC Start=928766><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=929618><P Class=KRCC>
Cypress College. 

<SYNC Start=930852><P Class=KRCC>
Interned at Fisher & Sons. 

<SYNC Start=932334><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, so, you're the guy from Fisher & Sons! 

<SYNC Start=934029><P Class=KRCC>
You got out of there just in time. 

<SYNC Start=935883><P Class=KRCC>
Kroehner's gonna bury him. 

<SYNC Start=936972><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=938480><P Class=KRCC>
I don't think so. 

<SYNC Start=939799><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=940138><P Class=KRCC>
Somebody burned down the funeral home 

<SYNC Start=941692><P Class=KRCC>
Kroehner was building across the street. 

<SYNC Start=943526><P Class=KRCC>
Somebody? 

<SYNC Start=944783><P Class=KRCC>
You ever heard of Jewish lightning? 

<SYNC Start=946758><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=948132><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, sorry. Did I offend you? 

<SYNC Start=949158><P Class=KRCC>
I'm Jewish. 

<SYNC Start=949883><P Class=KRCC>
I can say that. 

<SYNC Start=951914><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=953010><P Class=KRCC>
Kroehner burned down their own building for the insurance money? 

<SYNC Start=956097><P Class=KRCC>
Trust me, it's not over. 

<SYNC Start=957381><P Class=KRCC>
It's like Matt Gilardi's personal vendetta. 

<SYNC Start=959603><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=960157><P Class=KRCC>
Fisher's history. 

<SYNC Start=961512><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=965967><P Class=KRCC>
Take care now. 

<SYNC Start=966469><P Class=KRCC>
Get home safe.

<SYNC Start=967425><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=968611><P Class=KRCC>
Aren't they a trip? 

<SYNC Start=969627><P Class=KRCC>
I love 'em. 

<SYNC Start=970471><P Class=KRCC>
Old people still know how to boogie. 

<SYNC Start=972057><P Class=KRCC>
Yeah. 

<SYNC Start=972189><P Class=KRCC>
More than me. 

<SYNC Start=973421><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, I can change that. 

<SYNC Start=975143><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=975894><P Class=KRCC>
I'm Kurt, by the way.

<SYNC Start=977151><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=978647><P Class=KRCC>
How'd it go? 

<SYNC Start=979963><P Class=KRCC>
Uh, terrific. 

<SYNC Start=981524><P Class=KRCC>
Uh, great. 

<SYNC Start=983149><P Class=KRCC>
So I guess you'll be coming back? 

<SYNC Start=984534><P Class=KRCC>
I hope so. 

<SYNC Start=985528><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=987076><P Class=KRCC>
This really was a great idea, Nate. 

<SYNC Start=988991><P Class=KRCC>
So it seems, Dave. 

<SYNC Start=990969><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=993010><P Class=KRCC>
So--

<SYNC Start=993496><P Class=KRCC>
Dave--

<SYNC Start=994525><P Class=KRCC>
you free tomorrow night? 

<SYNC Start=995738><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=997129><P Class=KRCC>
Yes. 

<SYNC Start=998443><P Class=KRCC>
We're in the middle of a dry spell. 

<SYNC Start=999723><P Class=KRCC>
He's got nothing but time. 

<SYNC Start=1000816><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1001711><P Class=KRCC>
How's 8? 

<SYNC Start=1003352><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1003922><P Class=KRCC>
8 for dinner? 

<SYNC Start=1006693><P Class=KRCC>
Is OK. 

<SYNC Start=1007332><P Class=KRCC>
Great! 

<SYNC Start=1008110><P Class=KRCC>
I'll pick you up. 

<SYNC Start=1009730><P Class=KRCC>
See you tomorrow.
<SYNC Start=1010726><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=1021209><P Class=KRCC>
You just pimped me out to that kid. 

<SYNC Start=1023023><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1023274><P Class=KRCC>
That kid wants to jump your bones. 

<SYNC Start=1025759><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, come on, David. 

<SYNC Start=1026452><P Class=KRCC>
I watch "Will and Grace." 

<SYNC Start=1027503><P Class=KRCC>
I've got gay-dar. 

<SYNC Start=1028538><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1029124><P Class=KRCC>
OK, don't say 

<SYNC Start=1029751><P Class=KRCC>
"gay-dar."

<SYNC Start=1031343><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1032752><P Class=KRCC>
Sure wish we could light up that joint. 

<SYNC Start=1034686><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1035244><P Class=KRCC>
Yeah, 

<SYNC Start=1035662><P Class=KRCC>
Dennis is watching us like a hawk

<SYNC Start=1037629><P Class=KRCC>
now that we have officially established ourselves as the anti-social losers. 

<SYNC Start=1041847><P Class=KRCC>
Uh, we'll just sneak off after we set up camp, 

<SYNC Start=1044938><P Class=KRCC>
while the rest of the bush group groom each other for lice. 

<SYNC Start=1047819><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1052248><P Class=KRCC>
Hi, Claire. 

<SYNC Start=1053598><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1054477><P Class=KRCC>
Hi. 

<SYNC Start=1055399><P Class=KRCC>
Whoa, whoa. 

<SYNC Start=1057187><P Class=KRCC>
You two are friends? 

<SYNC Start=1058376><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1059248><P Class=KRCC>
We go to the same school. 

<SYNC Start=1060318><P Class=KRCC>
We're not exactly friends. 

<SYNC Start=1062248><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1062733><P Class=KRCC>
We're not exactly enemies, either. 

<SYNC Start=1064536><P Class=KRCC>
we have classes together. 

<SYNC Start=1065878><P Class=KRCC>
One. 

<SYNC Start=1067700><P Class=KRCC>
Shouldn't you be leading us? 

<SYNC Start=1069545><P Class=KRCC>
Now the guy with braces is doing it. 

<SYNC Start=1072106><P Class=KRCC>
You know, everyone gets a turn. 

<SYNC Start=1074341><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1074385><P Class=KRCC>
Yeah, I thought we were gonna do some daredevil shit. 

<SYNC Start=1076302><P Class=KRCC>
I mean, we're just following a fuckin' map. 

<SYNC Start=1078023><P Class=KRCC>
This is fucking adolescent. 

<SYNC Start=1079775><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1080526><P Class=KRCC>
You guys have some pot? 

<SYNC Start=1081966><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=1082259><P Class=KRCC>
Maybe. 

<SYNC Start=1083084><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=1093197><P Class=KRCC>
Beautiful. 

<SYNC Start=1094699><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1094958><P Class=KRCC>
Absolutely beautiful. 

<SYNC Start=1097733><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1098377><P Class=KRCC>
What'd you use for the cheek bones? 

<SYNC Start=1100206><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1100717><P Class=KRCC>
Elmer's glue, dental floss, and modeling clay. 

<SYNC Start=1103669><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1104283><P Class=KRCC>
Should have had your work videotaped.

<SYNC Start=1106101><P Class=KRCC>
These lesser lites could learn from you. 

<SYNC Start=1107982><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1108583><P Class=KRCC>
I have a lot to learn myself. 

<SYNC Start=1109945><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1110521><P Class=KRCC>
Any interest in consulting? 

<SYNC Start=1112076><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1112488><P Class=KRCC>
My plate is full. 

<SYNC Start=1113489><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=1114264><P Class=KRCC>
How about something more permanent? 

<SYNC Start=1115908><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1116554><P Class=KRCC>
What's gonna happen to Fisher & Sons? 

<SYNC Start=1118360><P Class=KRCC>
What do you care?

<SYNC Start=1119037><P Class=KRCC>
Is your name Fisher? 

<SYNC Start=1119911><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1121666><P Class=KRCC>
Within 8 months, I can offer you your own home. 

<SYNC Start=1124229><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1124964><P Class=KRCC>
There's a position opening up in San Diego early next year.

<SYNC Start=1127943><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1128921><P Class=KRCC>
I'll think about it. 

<SYNC Start=1130005><P Class=KRCC>
Sure. 

<SYNC Start=1130852><P Class=KRCC>
Take some time.

Talk it over with your wife. 

<SYNC Start=1133843><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, and, by the way, 

<SYNC Start=1135820><P Class=KRCC>
this offer lasts 48 hours. 

<SYNC Start=1137645><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1162288><P Class=KRCC>
Brenda?

<SYNC Start=1163502><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1176928><P Class=KRCC>
Bren? 

<SYNC Start=1178202><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1186570><P Class=KRCC>
Hello? 

<SYNC Start=1188509><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1189160><P Class=KRCC>
Billy? 

<SYNC Start=1190024><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1203606><P Class=KRCC>
Fuck! 

<SYNC Start=1204379><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1206334><P Class=KRCC>
Crikey! 

<SYNC Start=1206999><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1207431><P Class=KRCC>
Who the fuck are you?!? 

<SYNC Start=1208924><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1209427><P Class=KRCC>
Name's Connor. 

<SYNC Start=1210377><P Class=KRCC>
Connor Thompson. 

<SYNC Start=1211352><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=1212107><P Class=KRCC>
You gotta be Nate. 

<SYNC Start=1213674><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1214926><P Class=KRCC>
Brenda's given me the John Dory on you. 

<SYNC Start=1217647><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1218407><P Class=KRCC>
Never told me you were this territorial, though. 

<SYNC Start=1220610><P Class=KRCC>
What's with the broken glass? 

<SYNC Start=1223105><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1224224><P Class=KRCC>
One too many largies last night. 

<SYNC Start=1226504><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1228573><P Class=KRCC>
Do you mind putting something on? 

<SYNC Start=1231083><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1231401><P Class=KRCC>
You, don't worry. 

<SYNC Start=1232745><P Class=KRCC>
Don't fancy blokes. 

<SYNC Start=1234199><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1234886><P Class=KRCC>
Nice pants there.

<SYNC Start=1235746><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=1241584><P Class=KRCC>
Is Brenda here? 

<SYNC Start=1242567><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1243308><P Class=KRCC>
Doesn't look like it. 

<SYNC Start=1244746><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1245207><P Class=KRCC>
Well, do you know where she is? 

<SYNC Start=1246377><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1246790><P Class=KRCC>
No. 

<SYNC Start=1248297><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1254234><P Class=KRCC>
I'm not ruining her, if that's what you think. 

<SYNC Start=1256570><P Class=KRCC>
No, she made it quite clear that wasn't an option. 

<SYNC Start=1258926><P Class=KRCC>
Her heart's got your name on it now. 

<SYNC Start=1260771><P Class=KRCC>
No, that would be her ass.

<SYNC Start=1262148><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1265685><P Class=KRCC>
You're thinkin' I'm pretty sass, arencha? 

<SYNC Start=1267767><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=1273203><P Class=KRCC>
Hey? 

<SYNC Start=1273865><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1275204><P Class=KRCC>
Any of you guys seen Topher? 

<SYNC Start=1276382><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1279616><P Class=KRCC>
Bet you can't wait to get back to Stepford.

<SYNC Start=1281827><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1294102><P Class=KRCC>
Take it you two have met. 

<SYNC Start=1295507><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1297991><P Class=KRCC>
These took forever to dry.

<SYNC Start=1299813><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1301068><P Class=KRCC>
Hey, you. 

<SYNC Start=1301897><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1314421><P Class=KRCC>
So apparently you were mad at me because I went to the desert without you. 

<SYNC Start=1317918><P Class=KRCC>
No. 

<SYNC Start=1318820><P Class=KRCC>
Well, what's with Crocodile Dundee then?

<SYNC Start=1320371><P Class=KRCC>
Why the fuck are you doing his laundry? 

<SYNC Start=1322039><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, dear. 

<SYNC Start=1322455><P Class=KRCC>
This is really unattractive behavior, Nate. 

<SYNC Start=1324621><P Class=KRCC>
Huh. 

<SYNC Start=1325198><P Class=KRCC>
Sorry. 

<SYNC Start=1325603><P Class=KRCC>
I guess I'm just a little weirded out that I keep running into naked guys in your house. 

<SYNC Start=1331527><P Class=KRCC>
They're still warm. 

<SYNC Start=1332707><P Class=KRCC>
Thanks, Lollies!

<SYNC Start=1333696><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1336157><P Class=KRCC>
Connor is a very old friend from a totally previous life. 

<SYNC Start=1338966><P Class=KRCC>
He hasn't been in LA for 10 years. 

<SYNC Start=1340560><P Class=KRCC>
Don't freak! 

<SYNC Start=1341487><P Class=KRCC>
I am not freaking. 

<SYNC Start=1342696><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1343391><P Class=KRCC>
ust exactly where does Nature Boy sleep? 

<SYNC Start=1346113><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1355800><P Class=KRCC>
Why didn't you tell me about him? 

<SYNC Start=1356993><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1357572><P Class=KRCC>
Because I knew that you would react like this. 

<SYNC Start=1360974><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1362698><P Class=KRCC>
I am touched that you're jealous. 

<SYNC Start=1365450><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1366649><P Class=KRCC>
Now, get over it, 

<SYNC Start=1368608><P Class=KRCC>
because you have no reason to be. 

<SYNC Start=1371503><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1372016><P Class=KRCC>
I promise.

<SYNC Start=1373168><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=1376756><P Class=KRCC>
If I was fucking him, I'd tell you. 

<SYNC Start=1378512><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, Jesus, that's comforting! 

<SYNC Start=1380381><P Class=KRCC>
Thank you! 

<SYNC Start=1380950><P Class=KRCC>
Come to dinner tomorrow night. 

<SYNC Start=1382083><P Class=KRCC>
Connor's cooking some Australian thing. 

<SYNC Start=1383530><P Class=KRCC>
Billy's coming over. 

<SYNC Start=1385062><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, Billy's coming over! 

<SYNC Start=1386629><P Class=KRCC>
Well, I thought he was staying with you. 

<SYNC Start=1387898><P Class=KRCC>
you've been fucking lying to me! 

<SYNC Start=1389392><P Class=KRCC>
I have spent the last 6 days worried sick about you, 

<SYNC Start=1392371><P Class=KRCC>
and you've been fuckin' partying your ass off! 

<SYNC Start=1394210><P Class=KRCC>
OK. 

<SYNC Start=1395855><P Class=KRCC>
I fucked up. 

<SYNC Start=1397982><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1398754><P Class=KRCC>
OK? 

<SYNC Start=1400130><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1404255><P Class=KRCC>
I've been under a little pressure, you know, with my brother having a nervous breakdown and everything. 

<SYNC Start=1408492><P Class=KRCC>
I was 

<SYNC Start=1410790><P Class=KRCC>
just trying to simplify things.

<SYNC Start=1413192><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1414922><P Class=KRCC>
Don't blow this out of proportion, please, Nate. 

<SYNC Start=1418775><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1422437><P Class=KRCC>
OK. 

<SYNC Start=1423305><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1427305><P Class=KRCC>
What time tomorrow night? 

<SYNC Start=1428571><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=1443375><P Class=KRCC>
Topher? 

<SYNC Start=1444241><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1450492><P Class=KRCC>
Fucking asshole! 

<SYNC Start=1451743><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1452159><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, Jesus! 

<SYNC Start=1453248><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=1454346><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, fuck! 

<SYNC Start=1456083><P Class=KRCC>
Shit! I'm sorry. 

<SYNC Start=1457780><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1459037><P Class=KRCC>
Fuck me!
<SYNC Start=1460135><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=1461336><P Class=KRCC>
Aw, shit! 

<SYNC Start=1462741><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1463632><P Class=KRCC>
Look, look,

<SYNC Start=1465201><P Class=KRCC>
she tells anybody, no one will believe her. 

<SYNC Start=1467751><P Class=KRCC>
Everyone thinks she's like crazy

<SYNC Start=1470066><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1471659><P Class=KRCC>
The sexual habits of the Koala are quite mysterious 

<SYNC Start=1474657><P Class=KRCC>
because of the complicated reproductive systems...

<SYNC Start=1477359><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1478218><P Class=KRCC>
The male Koala's penis is forked like a snake's tongue...

<SYNC Start=1482222><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1482486><P Class=KRCC>
The female has two vaginas.

<SYNC Start=1485215><P Class=KRCC>
Whatchu watching? 

<SYNC Start=1486321><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=1488510><P Class=KRCC>
Very funny. 

<SYNC Start=1490044><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1492118><P Class=KRCC>
What's up? 

<SYNC Start=1492980><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=1493760><P Class=KRCC>
Well, just thought you should know, 

<SYNC Start=1496290><P Class=KRCC>
I called Vanessa, and there was no ultrasound today. 

<SYNC Start=1498790><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1499418><P Class=KRCC>
And I also think Rico took a couple of bottles of stuff from the prep room. 

<SYNC Start=1502643><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1503504><P Class=KRCC>
Shit. 

<SYNC Start=1504398><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1505592><P Class=KRCC>
Fucking Kroehner. 

<SYNC Start=1506737><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1508867><P Class=KRCC>
Alright, I'll call around, see what I can find out. 

<SYNC Start=1510596><P Class=KRCC>
Why didn't you tell me about this earlier? 

<SYNC Start=1512175><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1513178><P Class=KRCC>
I was going to, but I got distracted by you and the square dance guy.

<SYNC Start=1516767><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1518703><P Class=KRCC>
Look, it's not like Rico has an exclusive contract with us or anything.

<SYNC Start=1521900><P Class=KRCC>
So he's moonlighting. 

<SYNC Start=1522873><P Class=KRCC>
Moonlighting is when you take a job when your first job is over. 

<SYNC Start=1525713><P Class=KRCC>
When he takes a job for Gilardi while he's still on the clock with us, that's treason. 

<SYNC Start=1529362><P Class=KRCC>
Stop being such a drama queen. 

<SYNC Start=1530666><P Class=KRCC>
Stop acting like your honorary mayor of West Hollywood all of a sudden. 

<SYNC Start=1534462><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1538910><P Class=KRCC>
He lied to our faces. 
<SYNC Start=1541250><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=1543367><P Class=KRCC>
Yeah, he did. 

<SYNC Start=1545602><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=1552181><P Class=KRCC>
Hey, Claire. 

<SYNC Start=1553723><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1555147><P Class=KRCC>
Hey, look, I'm sorry about last night. 

<SYNC Start=1559039><P Class=KRCC>
I thought you and Topher-- 

<SYNC Start=1560072><P Class=KRCC>
It's OK. 

<SYNC Start=1560938><P Class=KRCC>
But, whatever, it's none of my business. 

<SYNC Start=1562647><P Class=KRCC>
No, it's OK. 

<SYNC Start=1563432><P Class=KRCC>
I just--I don't know--<br>I hope you won't just write me off now. 

<SYNC Start=1568326><P Class=KRCC>
I mean, maybe it'll even like break the ice. 

<SYNC Start=1572701><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1574102><P Class=KRCC>
Yeah. 
<SYNC Start=1575088><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=1578997><P Class=KRCC>
I just kinda, you know, think you're funny <br>and cool and, well, sometimes, 

<SYNC Start=1584826><P Class=KRCC>
I feel boring and lame around you, and I think it's 'cause,<br> I don't know, I kind of wanna be your friend. 

<SYNC Start=1596567><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1598083><P Class=KRCC>
Why? 

<SYNC Start=1599266><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=1600616><P Class=KRCC>
Why not? 

<SYNC Start=1601623><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1606454><P Class=KRCC>
OK, this is totally weird. 

<SYNC Start=1608567><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1626934><P Class=KRCC>
How's Vanessa? 

<SYNC Start=1628046><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1629922><P Class=KRCC>
She's great. Yeah. 

<SYNC Start=1633154><P Class=KRCC>
The baby's as strong as a bouncer.

<SYNC Start=1634641><P Class=KRCC>
How's Chloe Yorkin? 

<SYNC Start=1637170><P Class=KRCC>
Some of your more ardent fans in prep room around LA<br> are calling this one your Sistine Chapel. 

<SYNC Start=1646623><P Class=KRCC>
Look, I told Gilardi it was a 1 time thing. 

<SYNC Start=1651458><P Class=KRCC>
I mean, come on, guys, <br>you gotta--you gotta understand. 

<SYNC Start=1654546><P Class=KRCC>
It wasn't for the money. 

<SYNC Start=1656555><P Class=KRCC>
I mean, her head was like a--

<SYNC Start=1659034><P Class=KRCC>
like a watermelon somebody hit with a sledgehammer. 

<SYNC Start=1662442><P Class=KRCC>
I mean, a case like that doesn't come along every day. 

<SYNC Start=1665431><P Class=KRCC>
What did he offer you to leave? 

<SYNC Start=1667448><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1669930><P Class=KRCC>
What are you offering me to stay?

<SYNC Start=1672381><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1676772><P Class=KRCC>
What?

<SYNC Start=1677724><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1679401><P Class=KRCC>
You guys thought I would stay out of loyalty? 

<SYNC Start=1681680><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1683061><P Class=KRCC>
Unlike you two, 

<SYNC Start=1683976><P Class=KRCC>
I have a wife and kids to think about. 

<SYNC Start=1686091><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1687104><P Class=KRCC>
What do you want? 

<SYNC Start=1688696><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1690008><P Class=KRCC>
I want to be a partner. 

<SYNC Start=1691045><P Class=KRCC>
That would require a significant financial investment on your part. 

<SYNC Start=1695404><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1697114><P Class=KRCC>
That's what partners are. 

<SYNC Start=1698845><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1701182><P Class=KRCC>
Rico, let Dave and me talk. 

<SYNC Start=1702869><P Class=KRCC>
Don't do anything until we have a chance to counter, OK? 

<SYNC Start=1705547><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1708639><P Class=KRCC>
OK. 

<SYNC Start=1709795><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1719052><P Class=KRCC>
Maybe we can work out some sort of profit-sharing plan. 

<SYNC Start=1721103><P Class=KRCC>
He's finally figured out he's worth more than we can pay him. 

<SYNC Start=1723961><P Class=KRCC>
We're fucked. 

<SYNC Start=1725280><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=1726822><P Class=KRCC>
OK, 

<SYNC Start=1728927><P Class=KRCC>
today we're gonna climb about 3000 feet<br> to a shelter close to the summit. 

<SYNC Start=1735057><P Class=KRCC>
Now, we have to move fast. 

<SYNC Start=1736995><P Class=KRCC>
When it gets dark, it gets cold. 

<SYNC Start=1739008><P Class=KRCC>
Why did you sleep with him? 

<SYNC Start=1740507><P Class=KRCC>
I don't know. 

<SYNC Start=1741825><P Class=KRCC>
Just to see if I could. 

<SYNC Start=1743908><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1745184><P Class=KRCC>
So who hasn't been leader yet? 

<SYNC Start=1748125><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1753357><P Class=KRCC>
Claire. 

<SYNC Start=1754993><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=1755527><P Class=KRCC>
What? 

<SYNC Start=1757023><P Class=KRCC>
Which way do we go? 

<SYNC Start=1758747><P Class=KRCC>
I don't know. 

<SYNC Start=1759888><P Class=KRCC>
I really don't care. 

<SYNC Start=1761838><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1763187><P Class=KRCC>
Somebody else pick. 

<SYNC Start=1764271><P Class=KRCC>
Come on, Claire.<BR>Don't you wanna consult your map and compass? 

<SYNC Start=1766705><P Class=KRCC>
No, I think I lost my compass anyway. 

<SYNC Start=1769028><P Class=KRCC>
Well, borrow one from someone else. 

<SYNC Start=1771505><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1772776><P Class=KRCC>
Look, just pick someone else, OK? 

<SYNC Start=1775152><P Class=KRCC>
Please. 

<SYNC Start=1776851><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1782138><P Class=KRCC>
OK. 

<SYNC Start=1782743><P Class=KRCC>
That way. 

<SYNC Start=1784065><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1784620><P Class=KRCC>
I think we should go that way. 

<SYNC Start=1785551><P Class=KRCC>
It's obviously the path.

<SYNC Start=1787172><P Class=KRCC>
OK, maybe someone else would like to--

<SYNC Start=1789113><P Class=KRCC>
Hey, Claire paid her 1200 bucks, too. 

<SYNC Start=1792132><P Class=KRCC>
Doesn't she get a turn?

<SYNC Start=1793294><P Class=KRCC>
Don't pull me into your shit, OK? 

<SYNC Start=1795828><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1801481><P Class=KRCC>
OK, look, alright. 

<SYNC Start=1803790><P Class=KRCC>
Let's all take out our maps and compasses.

<SYNC Start=1807084><P Class=KRCC>
It's Claire's turn, Dennis. 

<SYNC Start=1809319><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1810745><P Class=KRCC>
I think we should follow Claire, <br>and she said we should go this way. 

<SYNC Start=1815842><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1819676><P Class=KRCC>
OK, 

<SYNC Start=1821740><P Class=KRCC>
this way it is. 

<SYNC Start=1822866><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1828052><P Class=KRCC>
Thanks a lot. 

<SYNC Start=1829291><P Class=KRCC>
What? 

<SYNC Start=1830196><P Class=KRCC>
Now this trip is finally starting to be fun. 

<SYNC Start=1832975><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1834319><P Class=KRCC>
I prefer busy to quiet. 

<SYNC Start=1837550><P Class=KRCC>
Some peoples, 

<SYNC Start=1840067><P Class=KRCC>
they like nothing to do. 

<SYNC Start=1841894><P Class=KRCC>
Me, drives me crazy, 

<SYNC Start=1844553><P Class=KRCC>
and, besides, 

<SYNC Start=1846421><P Class=KRCC>
no customer, 

<SYNC Start=1847473><P Class=KRCC>
no money. 

<SYNC Start=1849925><P Class=KRCC>
When I'm walking by this restaurant every day while I'm going home, 

<SYNC Start=1854468><P Class=KRCC>
this Ethiopian restaurant, 

<SYNC Start=1857319><P Class=KRCC>
no customer, 

<SYNC Start=1858734><P Class=KRCC>
every night, night after night, no customer! 

<SYNC Start=1862009><P Class=KRCC>
How they can make a living, I don't know. 

<SYNC Start=1863655><P Class=KRCC>
I don't understand this...

<SYNC Start=1891670><P Class=KRCC>
I boring you? 

<SYNC Start=1893475><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1895718><P Class=KRCC>
Heavens no. 

<SYNC Start=1897776><P Class=KRCC>
Good. 

<SYNC Start=1899389><P Class=KRCC>
Watch you don't cut your finger. 

<SYNC Start=1901722><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1907141><P Class=KRCC>
Did you really put a foot in Gabe Dimas' locker? 

<SYNC Start=1910210><P Class=KRCC>
Yeah. 

<SYNC Start=1911185><P Class=KRCC>
Oh my God, that is like the greatest thing ever.

<SYNC Start=1914351><P Class=KRCC>
Anyone ever deserved it--

<SYNC Start=1916670><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1916830><P Class=KRCC>
Did you have sex with him? 

<SYNC Start=1918099><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, yeah. 

<SYNC Start=1920062><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1920233><P Class=KRCC>
Did you suck his toes? 

<SYNC Start=1921926><P Class=KRCC>
Yup. 

<SYNC Start=1923636><P Class=KRCC>
I'm gonna have to ask the two of you to turn around. 

<SYNC Start=1926094><P Class=KRCC>
What? 

<SYNC Start=1927451><P Class=KRCC>
I'll accompany you both back to the last camp. 

<SYNC Start=1929346><P Class=KRCC>
A jeep will meet you there, take you back to base parking. 
<SYNC Start=1931250><P Class=KRCC>
You're kicking us out?

<SYNC Start=1933046><P Class=KRCC>
You can't do that! 

<SYNC Start=1933860><P Class=KRCC>
Yes we can. 

<SYNC Start=1934770><P Class=KRCC>
It's on the contract that you and your adult guardian signed. 

<SYNC Start=1938157><P Class=KRCC>
What? 

<SYNC Start=1938338><P Class=KRCC>
Anyone who witnesses a group leader having sex <br>with a student can be thrown out? 

<SYNC Start=1942031><P Class=KRCC>
I doubt it. 

<SYNC Start=1942443><P Class=KRCC>
You purposely lead us off the predetermined course, <br>endangering everyone's safety, 

<SYNC Start=1949212><P Class=KRCC>
and I'd be willing to bet that there's drugs in your pack. 

<SYNC Start=1951597><P Class=KRCC>
You can't go through my stuff. 

<SYNC Start=1952616><P Class=KRCC>
You need a search warrant!

<SYNC Start=1954175><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1956811><P Class=KRCC>
OK? 

<SYNC Start=1958418><P Class=KRCC>
Now, look, we can do this the easy way or<br> we can get the cops involved. 

<SYNC Start=1960819><P Class=KRCC>
What do you want? 

<SYNC Start=1962006><P Class=KRCC>
You are such a total loser. 

<SYNC Start=1964578><P Class=KRCC>
This is not a game, you little bitch. 

<SYNC Start=1967071><P Class=KRCC>
You are fucking with people's lives here. 

<SYNC Start=1968720><P Class=KRCC>
Some of those people are completely innocent bystanders! 

<SYNC Start=1971609><P Class=KRCC>
Hello! 

<SYNC Start=1972848><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1978363><P Class=KRCC>
David Fisher.


<SYNC Start=1979748><P Class=KRCC>
Is this the adult guardian of Claire Fisher? 

<SYNC Start=1983004><P Class=KRCC>
Uh--yes, 

<SYNC Start=1984092><P Class=KRCC>
that is correct. 

<SYNC Start=1985413><P Class=KRCC>
I'm with Sierra Crossroads. 

<SYNC Start=1986521><P Class=KRCC>
Your daughter was discovered with marijuana. 

<SYNC Start=1988418><P Class=KRCC>
She's leaving the expedition. 

<SYNC Start=1990618><P Class=KRCC>
Transportation's on its way to take her back to her car. 

<SYNC Start=1992547><P Class=KRCC>
She should be back in LA by midnight tonight <br>instead of Sunday, as planned. 

<SYNC Start=1996832><P Class=KRCC>
Any questions? 

<SYNC Start=1998295><P Class=KRCC>
Uh--no,<br> thank you for calling. 

<SYNC Start=2003131><P Class=KRCC>
Your dad sounds like a real tight-ass. 

<SYNC Start=2006319><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2009289><P Class=KRCC>
Castenada, huh? 

<SYNC Start=2011125><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2012095><P Class=KRCC>
You still read that? 

<SYNC Start=2012730><P Class=KRCC>
Look, don't even. 

<SYNC Start=2014749><P Class=KRCC>
All need for us to interact has been removed. 

<SYNC Start=2017645><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2020570><P Class=KRCC>
Listen, how well do you know Parker? 

<SYNC Start=2023575><P Class=KRCC>
Hardly at all. 

<SYNC Start=2024921><P Class=KRCC>
'Cause I'd really hate it if she's one of those people who would,

<SYNC Start=2027359><P Class=KRCC>
you know, create a huge stink and ruin my life <br>just for the entertainment value of it. 

<SYNC Start=2032533><P Class=KRCC>
Sorry. <br>I don't really know her. 

<SYNC Start=2034649><P Class=KRCC>
God,<br> I hate pissing outdoors! 

<SYNC Start=2039292><P Class=KRCC>
Parker, don't light that. 

<SYNC Start=2041428><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=2046485><P Class=KRCC>
So who's in charge while you're here babysitting us? 

<SYNC Start=2049300><P Class=KRCC>
Topher. 

<SYNC Start=2050909><P Class=KRCC>
What? <br>He hates this whole Sierra Crossroads bullshit. 

<SYNC Start=2053419><P Class=KRCC>
What, are you kidding? 

<SYNC Start=2054972><P Class=KRCC>
He's been doing it since he's 14 years old. 

<SYNC Start=2057737><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2058709><P Class=KRCC>
You're so full of shit.

<SYNC Start=2059973><P Class=KRCC>
It's one of the things that helped him get accepted to Stanford. 

<SYNC Start=2063146><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2064064><P Class=KRCC>
Topher is going to Stanford? 

<SYNC Start=2066097><P Class=KRCC>
Pre-law. 

<SYNC Start=2067976><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2069654><P Class=KRCC>
This whole experience just gets more and more irritating. 

<SYNC Start=2073057><P Class=KRCC>
Here's your ride. 

<SYNC Start=2075200><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2091691><P Class=KRCC>
10 minutes. 

<SYNC Start=2093530><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=2108235><P Class=KRCC>
Damn, she looks good. 

<SYNC Start=2110819><P Class=KRCC>
You took Polaroids, right? 

<SYNC Start=2112428><P Class=KRCC>
Polaroids? 

<SYNC Start=2114114><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2114209><P Class=KRCC>
I borrowed Jacob's digital camera.

<SYNC Start=2117244><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2120767><P Class=KRCC>
You blended the filler material just perfect! 

<SYNC Start=2124501><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2124917><P Class=KRCC>
Honey,

<SYNC Start=2125888><P Class=KRCC>
she really is your Sistine Chapel! 

<SYNC Start=2129191><P Class=KRCC>
You think? 

<SYNC Start=2130081><P Class=KRCC>
Baby, you know. 

<SYNC Start=2133689><P Class=KRCC>
Too bad you gotta bury her. 

<SYNC Start=2135456><P Class=KRCC>
Yeah. 

<SYNC Start=2136810><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2139712><P Class=KRCC>
She looks beautiful, doesn't she? 

<SYNC Start=2141655><P Class=KRCC>
Never better. 

<SYNC Start=2142732><P Class=KRCC>
You should've seen her yesterday. 

<SYNC Start=2144550><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2145036><P Class=KRCC>
You're gonna take the offer. 

<SYNC Start=2146314><P Class=KRCC>
I haven't decided yet. 

<SYNC Start=2147753><P Class=KRCC>
No,<br> I said, you're gonna take the offer. 

<SYNC Start=2150746><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2151821><P Class=KRCC>
Where would I be without the Fishers? 

<SYNC Start=2153471><P Class=KRCC>
In a house. 

<SYNC Start=2154332><P Class=KRCC>
Not some lousy apartment. <br>They treat you like a migrant worker. 

<SYNC Start=2158391><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2160047><P Class=KRCC>
They'll never make me a partner. 

<SYNC Start=2162311><P Class=KRCC>
Not ever. 

<SYNC Start=2163665><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2165262><P Class=KRCC>
1500 a restoration. 

<SYNC Start=2168841><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2170790><P Class=KRCC>
Tuition at SC's highway robbery, so<br> calling helps pay for books and beer

<SYNC Start=2175351><P Class=KRCC>
It's either that or become a beeper boy.

<SYNC Start=2176928><P Class=KRCC>
I'm not quite ready to go there. 

<SYNC Start=2178919><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2179932><P Class=KRCC>
So <br>what's with the International Male shirt? 

<SYNC Start=2182585><P Class=KRCC>
This? 

<SYNC Start=2183146><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, <br>I borrowed it from my sister. 

<SYNC Start=2187388><P Class=KRCC>
It looks good. 

<SYNC Start=2189219><P Class=KRCC>
I bet it looks even better off. 

<SYNC Start=2191067><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2197013><P Class=KRCC>
So you were talking about square dance calling? 

<SYNC Start=2200202><P Class=KRCC>
Yeah, <br>it's my grandparents' group. 

<SYNC Start=2202542><P Class=KRCC>
They practically raised me after my parents kicked me out. 

<SYNC Start=2205354><P Class=KRCC>
Kicked you out? 

<SYNC Start=2206880><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2208115><P Class=KRCC>
When they found out about you--

<SYNC Start=2209399><P Class=KRCC>
When my father walked in on me and my <br>high school boyfriend fucking on the desk in his study. 

<SYNC Start=2214023><P Class=KRCC>
It was awful. 

<SYNC Start=2215158><P Class=KRCC>
My mother had a complete breakdown. 

<SYNC Start=2217144><P Class=KRCC>
My parents eventually split. 

<SYNC Start=2219717><P Class=KRCC>
It was a total movie for Lifetime. 

<SYNC Start=2221680><P Class=KRCC>
What about you?<br> What did your parents do? 

<SYNC Start=2224019><P Class=KRCC>
When I came out? 

<SYNC Start=2225907><P Class=KRCC>
Uh, <br>my dad was OK with it. 

<SYNC Start=2228088><P Class=KRCC>
My mom's still a little uncomfortable. 

<SYNC Start=2230327><P Class=KRCC>
It still baffles me that anyone even gives a shit, <br>you know? 

<SYNC Start=2233419><P Class=KRCC>
Here you go. <br>For you. Enjoy.

<SYNC Start=2237196><P Class=KRCC>
You have a boyfriend? 

<SYNC Start=2239647><P Class=KRCC>
Uh--<br>no. 

<SYNC Start=2241476><P Class=KRCC>
Why not? 

<SYNC Start=2243061><P Class=KRCC>
I'm not sure. 

<SYNC Start=2245677><P Class=KRCC>
You ever have one? 

<SYNC Start=2247157><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2247791><P Class=KRCC>
Yeah. You? 

<SYNC Start=2249220><P Class=KRCC>
Yeah. Several. 

<SYNC Start=2251143><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2254143><P Class=KRCC>
You've got the longest eyelashes I've ever seen. 

<SYNC Start=2257174><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2258535><P Class=KRCC>
I've always liked older guys. 

<SYNC Start=2260652><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2261916><P Class=KRCC>
I'm "the older guy"? 

<SYNC Start=2263036><P Class=KRCC>
Guys my age are idiots. 

<SYNC Start=2265247><P Class=KRCC>
They're fun to fuck, but<br> it usually ends there. 

<SYNC Start=2268494><P Class=KRCC>
And I hate the way they treat older men, you know? 

<SYNC Start=2270185><P Class=KRCC>
"Tired old queen, fossil, troll"? 

<SYNC Start=2272397><P Class=KRCC>
As if we're not gonna end up there ourselves one day,<br> if we're lucky. 

<SYNC Start=2276263><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2278430><P Class=KRCC>
Uh, I'm getting my Masters in Social <br>Work with a concentration on Services for Seniors, 

<SYNC Start=2283075><P Class=KRCC>
so it's a pet peeve of mine. 

<SYNC Start=2284488><P Class=KRCC>
Are you a top or a bottom? 

<SYNC Start=2286262><P Class=KRCC>
What? 
<SYNC Start=2287501><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=2289999><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, I'm versatile. 

<SYNC Start=2293731><P Class=KRCC>
Bottom. 

<SYNC Start=2294095><P Class=KRCC>
Good. <br>Wow. 

<SYNC Start=2294655><P Class=KRCC>
This'll work out well. 

<SYNC Start=2295992><P Class=KRCC>
You wanna get out of here? 

<SYNC Start=2298037><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2299188><P Class=KRCC>
Yeah. 

<SYNC Start=2300266><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2304446><P Class=KRCC>
So the bastard took it! 

<SYNC Start=2306391><P Class=KRCC>
I lost my investment, my bike, fuckin' everything. 

<SYNC Start=2309655><P Class=KRCC>
Connor, that always happens to you! 

<SYNC Start=2312256><P Class=KRCC>
Know, <br>I guess I can always get back on the old Banana Roll, hey? 

<SYNC Start=2318468><P Class=KRCC>
You remember, what was that, that thing in Texas? 

<SYNC Start=2321588><P Class=KRCC>
You lost your bike in Texas? 

<SYNC Start=2323049><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, not that fuckin one! 

<SYNC Start=2324482><P Class=KRCC>
Yes, that like '95 one, what was that. 

<SYNC Start=2333297><P Class=KRCC>
Hey, Nate, 

<SYNC Start=2336072><P Class=KRCC>
listen. 

<SYNC Start=2337407><P Class=KRCC>
I'm sorry about last week. 

<SYNC Start=2341217><P Class=KRCC>
I go off the meds now and then, just to feel alive. 

<SYNC Start=2346648><P Class=KRCC>
I'm sure you must have thought I was a total psycho. 

<SYNC Start=2350399><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2350750><P Class=KRCC>
Crossed my mind. 

<SYNC Start=2352812><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2355002><P Class=KRCC>
Well, I'm not.

<SYNC Start=2356654><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2370860><P Class=KRCC>
I don't wanna come between you and my sister. 

<SYNC Start=2373397><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2375169><P Class=KRCC>
She's happy with you. 

<SYNC Start=2377560><P Class=KRCC>
Happier than I've seen her in a long time. 

<SYNC Start=2381060><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=2382673><P Class=KRCC>
That is so tragic...

<SYNC Start=2386139><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=2387471><P Class=KRCC>
So what's your story? 

<SYNC Start=2389126><P Class=KRCC>
Just another spunk to add to your collection? 

<SYNC Start=2392276><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2394419><P Class=KRCC>
So what's left for me to do? 

<SYNC Start=2395973><P Class=KRCC>
Become an air hostess? 

<SYNC Start=2398281><P Class=KRCC>
I think you should get a TV show, <br>where you wrestle things, right, 

<SYNC Start=2402655><P Class=KRCC>
but not animals...things! 

<SYNC Start=2405448><P Class=KRCC>
Like what things? 

<SYNC Start=2406455><P Class=KRCC>
Like...refrigerators...and here's the title of it... 

<SYNC Start=2412404><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=2422626><P Class=KRCC>
Hey, Connor, 

<SYNC Start=2422880><P Class=KRCC>
What's Your John Dory? 

<SYNC Start=2424719><P Class=KRCC>
WHAT FUCKING LANGUAGE ARE YOU SPEAKING? 

<SYNC Start=2428648><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2429503><P Class=KRCC>
Hey, Nate,

<SYNC Start=2430594><P Class=KRCC>
buddy. 

<SYNC Start=2432024><P Class=KRCC>
Chill. 

<SYNC Start=2434276><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2440619><P Class=KRCC>
This car is like total Graceland on wheels. 

<SYNC Start=2445013><P Class=KRCC>
Total love nest. 

<SYNC Start=2447473><P Class=KRCC>
Have you ever fucked in here? 

<SYNC Start=2449523><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2450033><P Class=KRCC>
Once. 

<SYNC Start=2451757><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=2453446><P Class=KRCC>
This record exec, a friend of my dad's, 

<SYNC Start=2456591><P Class=KRCC>
he's got like this total makeout van from the 70?s. 

<SYNC Start=2459402><P Class=KRCC>
He thinks it's so cool, and it's just not. 

<SYNC Start=2463226><P Class=KRCC>
How do you think Dennis knew I had pot? 

<SYNC Start=2465949><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2467531><P Class=KRCC>
So your dad died, huh? 

<SYNC Start=2469686><P Class=KRCC>
What was that like? 

<SYNC Start=2471699><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2473358><P Class=KRCC>
I don't know. 

<SYNC Start=2476540><P Class=KRCC>
Doesn't seem real. 

<SYNC Start=2478739><P Class=KRCC>
I never knew anybody that died. 

<SYNC Start=2480966><P Class=KRCC>
Well, I grew up in a funeral home,<br> so I was always around it. 

<SYNC Start=2485985><P Class=KRCC>
OK, was that completely weird? 

<SYNC Start=2490354><P Class=KRCC>
Yes. 

<SYNC Start=2491399><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2494327><P Class=KRCC>
My dad's a big shot at Disney. 

<SYNC Start=2496388><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2497497><P Class=KRCC>
Really? <br>Why don't you go to a private school? 

<SYNC Start=2500715><P Class=KRCC>
He divorced my mom a long time ago. 

<SYNC Start=2503447><P Class=KRCC>
He likes his new family better. 

<SYNC Start=2505839><P Class=KRCC>
He won't give my mom alimony because <br>he caught her having sex with like this retarded guy. 

<SYNC Start=2512942><P Class=KRCC>
Fuck. 

<SYNC Start=2513947><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2516064><P Class=KRCC>
I'm kidding. 

<SYNC Start=2517192><P Class=KRCC>
My mom gets killer alimony. 

<SYNC Start=2519397><P Class=KRCC>
I just keep getting kicked out of private schools. 

<SYNC Start=2522441><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2524864><P Class=KRCC>
I thought you were like this little overachiever, <br>like little Miss Perfect. 

<SYNC Start=2529001><P Class=KRCC>
Good. <br>That's what I want people to think. 

<SYNC Start=2531975><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2532769><P Class=KRCC>
When in reality you're like this compulsive liar/danger slut. 

<SYNC Start=2538086><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2540708><P Class=KRCC>
I thought you were like this <br>Goth arty freak girl who was like tragic and suicidal. 

<SYNC Start=2548013><P Class=KRCC>
Oh my God, that's so not who I am. 

<SYNC Start=2550906><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2553163><P Class=KRCC>
Nobody's ever who they seem to be. 

<SYNC Start=2555723><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2558854><P Class=KRCC>
Nobody interesting. 

<SYNC Start=2560552><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2567376><P Class=KRCC>
I don't get this show. 

<SYNC Start=2569334><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2570188><P Class=KRCC>
It's a game show. 

<SYNC Start=2571022><P Class=KRCC>
I know that. 

<SYNC Start=2571871><P Class=KRCC>
I just don't understand why people like it. 

<SYNC Start=2574245><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=2574594><P Class=KRCC>
My friend Amelia says it's her favorite show. 

<SYNC Start=2577478><P Class=KRCC>
It's a great show. 

<SYNC Start=2579746><P Class=KRCC>
My son likes "Once Upon A Hamster." 

<SYNC Start=2582799><P Class=KRCC>
When I was his age, I was crazy for Mad Magazine, 

<SYNC Start=2586382><P Class=KRCC>
Ernie Kovacks, the Marx Brothers. 

<SYNC Start=2589300><P Class=KRCC>
Anybody that took pot shots at sacred cows. 

<SYNC Start=2592369><P Class=KRCC>
I mean anybody. 

<SYNC Start=2594345><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2619213><P Class=KRCC>
Yeah, I loved that stuff. 

<SYNC Start=2621689><P Class=KRCC>
Irreverence was my drug of choice. 

<SYNC Start=2624387><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2626276><P Class=KRCC>
Still is, <br>I guess.

<SYNC Start=2628970><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2639621><P Class=KRCC>
Night, mate. 

<SYNC Start=2641652><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2642173><P Class=KRCC>
I'm really glad you and Lolly's hooked up. 

<SYNC Start=2644954><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2646132><P Class=KRCC>
I mean, personally, <br>I couldn't handle her playing Freud all the fuckin' time. 

<SYNC Start=2651201><P Class=KRCC>
I mean, <br>I don't give a fuck why I am the way I am, right? 

<SYNC Start=2656257><P Class=KRCC>
Well, she is a complicated woman. 

<SYNC Start=2661369><P Class=KRCC>
No, she's not.

<SYNC Start=2663530><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=2733050><P Class=KRCC>
WHEN WAS THAT TAKEN? 

<SYNC Start=2734781><P Class=KRCC>
Two summers ago. 

<SYNC Start=2736882><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2737445><P Class=KRCC>
I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU HADN'T SEEN HIM 

<SYNC Start=2739864><P Class=KRCC>
IN A DECADE. 

<SYNC Start=2740791><P Class=KRCC>
No, I said Connor hasn't been to LA in a decade.

<SYNC Start=2745323><P Class=KRCC>
ALRIGHT, WHERE DO YOU SLEEP, MATE, <br>BECAUSE THAT SLEEPING BAG HASN?

<SYNC Start=2749003><P Class=KRCC>
T MOVED AN INCH IN DAYS! 

<SYNC Start=2750151><P Class=KRCC>
They sleep in the same bed, where else? 

<SYNC Start=2752140><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2753304><P Class=KRCC>
Don't crack a fit now, mate. 

<SYNC Start=2755598><P Class=KRCC>
I mean, she's totally wrapped up in you. 

<SYNC Start=2758084><P Class=KRCC>
OH, JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP, COWBOY! 

<SYNC Start=2760784><P Class=KRCC>
OK. 

<SYNC Start=2761507><P Class=KRCC>
OK.

<SYNC Start=2761999><P Class=KRCC>
I didn't tell you, because I knew you would react just like this. 

<SYNC Start=2764764><P Class=KRCC>
WELL, HOW ELSE AM I SUPPOSED TO REACT? 

<SYNC Start=2766564><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, so I'm supposed to make an old friend <br>sleep on the floor just to protect your macho pride?

<SYNC Start=2770959><P Class=KRCC>
YOU HAVE A SHIATSU MAT! 

<SYNC Start=2772677><P Class=KRCC>
Come on, man. 

<SYNC Start=2773123><P Class=KRCC>
Haven't you ever slept with a woman and not had sex with her? 

<SYNC Start=2777634><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2780044><P Class=KRCC>
NO! 

<SYNC Start=2781317><P Class=KRCC>
Outside! 

<SYNC Start=2782111><P Class=KRCC>
Get some air! 

<SYNC Start=2784040><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2784327><P Class=KRCC>
"OH, GO OUTSIDE, GET SOME AIR!" 

<SYNC Start=2786773><P Class=KRCC>
FUCK YOU!! 

<SYNC Start=2788156><P Class=KRCC>
I'M LEAVING!!! 

<SYNC Start=2789680><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2793848><P Class=KRCC>
HAVE FUN WITH YOUR AUSSIE 

<SYNC Start=2795354><P Class=KRCC>
FUCK, <br>MINDFUCKER!!! 

<SYNC Start=2798551><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2810394><P Class=KRCC>
Damn, you are versatile! 

<SYNC Start=2812365><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=2818134><P Class=KRCC>
So, you think I'm being <br>a possessive asshole for wanting Brenda for myself? 

<SYNC Start=2822231><P Class=KRCC>
Well, when you feel connected with someone, <br>it doesn't mean you're possessive or an asshole. 

<SYNC Start=2826534><P Class=KRCC>
But until there's a commitment, you have no claim on her. 

<SYNC Start=2829970><P Class=KRCC>
A woman doesn't have to wait to be chosen anymore. 

<SYNC Start=2832194><P Class=KRCC>
Now she can do the choosing. 

<SYNC Start=2833320><P Class=KRCC>
Yeah, but if she waits too long the right guy might just move on. 

<SYNC Start=2836750><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2837802><P Class=KRCC>
You're right, dear. 

<SYNC Start=2838611><P Class=KRCC>
You're so right. 

<SYNC Start=2839736><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2840949><P Class=KRCC>
A chartered bus headed for Vegas overturned on the 10 last night! 

<SYNC Start=2845106><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2846021><P Class=KRCC>
44 passengers, 

<SYNC Start=2848737><P Class=KRCC>
most of them dead! 

<SYNC Start=2850484><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2851716><P Class=KRCC>
Did you sleep well last night? 

<SYNC Start=2852974><P Class=KRCC>
Yes, thank you. 

<SYNC Start=2854635><P Class=KRCC>
Did you sleep at all last night? 

<SYNC Start=2856590><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2857655><P Class=KRCC>
How'd the funeral director's test go? 

<SYNC Start=2859772><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, man, I choked. 

<SYNC Start=2861461><P Class=KRCC>
Had a cluster fuck. 

<SYNC Start=2862681><P Class=KRCC>
Language! 

<SYNC Start=2864094><P Class=KRCC>
You just said "asshole." 

<SYNC Start=2865116><P Class=KRCC>
Nate, I need you to pass that test. 

<SYNC Start=2866883><P Class=KRCC>
Yeah, well, Dave,<br> I need you to lighten up on me, starting now. 

<SYNC Start=2871122><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2876585><P Class=KRCC>
Hey, 

<SYNC Start=2878760><P Class=KRCC>
first of all, 

<SYNC Start=2879990><P Class=KRCC>
I just want to thank you guys for everything you've done for me. 

<SYNC Start=2882864><P Class=KRCC>
But I think it's time for me to move on. 

<SYNC Start=2885305><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2885919><P Class=KRCC>
I have to think about my future, my family's future. 

<SYNC Start=2889498><P Class=KRCC>
You're leaving us? 

<SYNC Start=2890832><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, dear! 

<SYNC Start=2891969><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=2892212><P Class=KRCC>
You haven't even given us a chance to counter Kroehner's--

<SYNC Start=2894409><P Class=KRCC>
Am I a partner? 

<SYNC Start=2895847><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2902130><P Class=KRCC>
You guys didn't even talk about it. 

<SYNC Start=2905452><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2910207><P Class=KRCC>
Thank you, Federico. 

<SYNC Start=2911806><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2913923><P Class=KRCC>
I'm sorry that we can't offer you more. 

<SYNC Start=2916084><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2918945><P Class=KRCC>
You will always have a job waiting for you here. 

<SYNC Start=2921394><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2926254><P Class=KRCC>
Kroehner will never appreciate how good you are, Rico. 

<SYNC Start=2928105><P Class=KRCC>
You'll just be a part of their assembly line. 

<SYNC Start=2931016><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2932675><P Class=KRCC>
Hey, we'll see. 

<SYNC Start=2935028><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2939425><P Class=KRCC>
A word of advice, guys. 

<SYNC Start=2941412><P Class=KRCC>
Don't turn your back on Gilardi. 

<SYNC Start=2943271><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2945369><P Class=KRCC>
Well, so much for loyalty. 

<SYNC Start=2947762><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2948311><P Class=KRCC>
Nate, he's given us five years. 

<SYNC Start=2949682><P Class=KRCC>
He doesn't owe us anything. 

<SYNC Start=2951785><P Class=KRCC>
Nobody does. 

<SYNC Start=2953328><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2974266><P Class=KRCC>
My only defense is I think I was hallucinating. 

<SYNC Start=2977798><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2979878><P Class=KRCC>
That and the thought of you with another man makes me crazy. 

<SYNC Start=2983325><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2984109><P Class=KRCC>
Sorry. 

<SYNC Start=2985609><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2987720><P Class=KRCC>
I'm just a guy that way. 

<SYNC Start=2989522><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2991136><P Class=KRCC>
So, where's Connor? 

<SYNC Start=2992171><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, God, I threw him out. 

<SYNC Start=2994149><P Class=KRCC>
There's only so much of him I can take. 

<SYNC Start=2996978><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2999452><P Class=KRCC>
So you forgive me?

<SYNC Start=3000856><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3002056><P Class=KRCC>
Sure. Why not? 

<SYNC Start=3003085><P Class=KRCC>
Good. 

<SYNC Start=3005114><P Class=KRCC>
Now it's your turn. 

<SYNC Start=3007877><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3009033><P Class=KRCC>
You want me to apologize? 

<SYNC Start=3010386><P Class=KRCC>
Yes...

<SYNC Start=3011702><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3015281><P Class=KRCC>
For trying to use Billy's meltdown <br>and Connor's visit to push me away. 

<SYNC Start=3020263><P Class=KRCC>
For being impatient with my very valid emotional response to each one, 

<SYNC Start=3023985><P Class=KRCC>
and for always asking me to adjust my behavior and feelings <br>but never be willing to do that yourself. 

<SYNC Start=3030171><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3033010><P Class=KRCC>
OK. That's fair. 

<SYNC Start=3035052><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3036952><P Class=KRCC>
I apologize. 

<SYNC Start=3038782><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3040221><P Class=KRCC>
Part of you wants me to bail. 

<SYNC Start=3042530><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3043074><P Class=KRCC>
Yeah.<br> You're probably right. 

<SYNC Start=3046552><P Class=KRCC>
Why? 

<SYNC Start=3047689><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3053096><P Class=KRCC>
Because I've already gone further than <br>I have with anybody since--

<SYNC Start=3058922><P Class=KRCC>
since a long time ago. 

<SYNC Start=3061001><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3064349><P Class=KRCC>
Because every time I've ever believed in a happy ending, <br>I've gotten severely fucked. 

<SYNC Start=3071170><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3072990><P Class=KRCC>
Sorry.

<SYNC Start=3074268><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3077007><P Class=KRCC>
Well, do me a favor. 

<SYNC Start=3078348><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3079745><P Class=KRCC>
Promise me from here on out,<br>I am the only man in your bed and in your life. 

<SYNC Start=3084084><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3084880><P Class=KRCC>
i'm serious, Bren. 

<SYNC Start=3086825><P Class=KRCC>
Promise me. 

<SYNC Start=3088088><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3091242><P Class=KRCC>
I promise. 

<SYNC Start=3092656><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3093712><P Class=KRCC>
I love you, and I wanna be with you for the long haul, <br>but there is a limit to the amount of shit I will put up with. 

<SYNC Start=3098770><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3099378><P Class=KRCC>
Did you just make me a lifetime commitment, <br>right before the thinly veiled threat of abandonment? 

<SYNC Start=3105455><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3106475><P Class=KRCC>
Well, I don't remember using the word "lifetime." 

<SYNC Start=3109278><P Class=KRCC>
Well, I wouldn't hold you to it. 

<SYNC Start=3112046><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3122098><P Class=KRCC>
Sorry I'm so 

<SYNC Start=3124385><P Class=KRCC>
weird about intimacy. 

<SYNC Start=3127402><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3128426><P Class=KRCC>
I guess spending your childhood getting picked apart by<br> behavioral psychologists will do that. 

<SYNC Start=3135583><P Class=KRCC>
Well, not being able to sleep at night <br>because your basement's full of dead people takes its toll, too. 

<SYNC Start=3143606><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3159602><P Class=KRCC>
Sorry. 

<SYNC Start=3161015><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3163373><P Class=KRCC>
It's OK. 
<SYNC Start=3164713><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=3166398><P Class=KRCC>
Nate Fisher.

<SYNC Start=3167400><P Class=KRCC>
Remember that chartered bus that overturned last night? 

<SYNC Start=3170112><P Class=KRCC>
They were all locals! <br>We're getting three of them! 

<SYNC Start=3172537><P Class=KRCC>
The first family will be here in an hour. 

<SYNC Start=3174336><P Class=KRCC>
I'm on my way. 

<SYNC Start=3176588><P Class=KRCC>
And try to curb your enthusiasm. 

<SYNC Start=3178320><P Class=KRCC>
This'll be tough without Rico. 

<SYNC Start=3180403><P Class=KRCC>
See you later.

<SYNC Start=3181728><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3202033><P Class=KRCC>
Good lord,<br> what'd they do to you? 

<SYNC Start=3203304><P Class=KRCC>
Don't ask.

<SYNC Start=3205017><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3211450><P Class=KRCC>
So did Mom freak when you told her I got busted? 

<SYNC Start=3214617><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3215059><P Class=KRCC>
I didn't tell her. 

<SYNC Start=3217150><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3218310><P Class=KRCC>
OK. Why? 
<SYNC Start=3220244><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=3220603><P Class=KRCC>
I don't know.<br> Other stuff came up. 

<SYNC Start=3222064><P Class=KRCC>
Seemed like a low priority. 

<SYNC Start=3224394><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3224842><P Class=KRCC>
Are you going to? 

<SYNC Start=3225850><P Class=KRCC>
Probably not. 

<SYNC Start=3227619><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3231396><P Class=KRCC>
I'm sorry the Crossroads thing didn't work out like you had hoped. 

<SYNC Start=3235072><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3235226><P Class=KRCC>
Actually, it was kind of amazing. 

<SYNC Start=3237411><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3238353><P Class=KRCC>
I think I really learned something valuable. 

<SYNC Start=3241598><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3241982><P Class=KRCC>
Everything I think I know is wrong. 

<SYNC Start=3245143><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3253449><P Class=KRCC>
Hey, what happened to that guy, Keith? 

<SYNC Start=3255714><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3260016><P Class=KRCC>
It just didn't work out. 

<SYNC Start=3262031><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3267190><P Class=KRCC>
That's too bad. 

<SYNC Start=3268721><P Class=KRCC>
Life goes on.

<SYNC Start=3270331><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3274570><P Class=KRCC>
That it does.

<SYNC Start=3276013><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3276597><P Class=KRCC>
Well, there's work to be done.
