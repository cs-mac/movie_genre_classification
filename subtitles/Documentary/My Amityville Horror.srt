tell somebody how you got thrown up that
staircase

31
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,599
it's not easy to tell somebody that

and sometimes bad things happen to good
people too

48

the Amityville house appears to be quite
peaceful now

00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,100
is that no evidence that any strange

on the world which still remains
mystified by the tales a bizarre

56
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,280
happenings

57
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,799
in a quiet house in a comparable Long
Island community I've never introduced

58
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:22,230
myself as that person

59
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:26,980
the guy from an okay ever you had to be
something completely different

what did you do instead

66
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,890
before revealing get intellectual

67

68
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,010

about you that because I'm not want to

69
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:02,840
just sit in

70
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:07,040

I thought I respect that

71
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,260
alright so good I kinda need to know
like what's the most dramatic thing

72
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,470
that's ever happened to you

73
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,500
the most romantic thing that's ever
happened to me arm

74
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,700
I think the most romantic thing that's
ever happened to me was moving

75
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:23,100
when I was 13 from one country to
another okay I think that was

76
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:27,500
for me and I was pretty scary an
overwhelming I moved here

77
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,570
United States i right on

78
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:34,660
but to for me to sit here knowing that
the most dramatic thing from view was

79
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,940
moved from one comes

80
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:39,480
to another and readjusting and you want
me to sit here and I'm gonna start

81
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,280
talking about

82
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,290
possessions annexes and bouncing off his
feelings

83
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:47,300
is not gonna be these thing for me to do
because I know you're only gonna be able

84
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,990
to connect with me

85
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,790
that in in well let me say this to you

86
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:55,590
and you're absolutely right I'm not
going to ever be able to know what you

87
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:58,390

understand right are

always respectful

91
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:13,650
what people's life experiences have been
is there someone that you're hoping to

92
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:14,650

my entire life I've been running away
from

104
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:18,970
and it finally caught up to me and I
couldn't hide

105
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:24,470

you know be the Amityville Horror kid
everywhere that I know people have

110
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,750
preconceived notions

111
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,250
me I didn't want to deal with it

112

Corvettes and you know you was very well
to do guy

143
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:52,870
somewhere along the line after my mother
had met George

144
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:56,230
between georgian my father there was in
agreements

you get it legally adopted three kids

146
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:06,270

Security and birth certificates and

147
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:09,850
yeah he was gonna put his name in label
on something that wasn't

148
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:13,820
ultimately his you know that's when I

149
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:18,200
just started destroying disguise world

150
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,760
every opportunity that I walked into

151
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,900
just do anything

152
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,680
to get him that we could go back all

153
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,830
let's put it this way

154
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:37,620
I don't think it was the Brady Bunch I
was somebody

155
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:42,120
that at the time for a couple of years
they became familiar with

156
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,150
but I actually saw these kids and
interacted with them

157
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:51,350
in their home I was just I was sorta a
presence

158
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,740
when I was there I certainly wasn't
harmful to them so I don't really think

159
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,860
that they were relating to me as a
reporter they certainly knew

160
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:02,780
how I came to know caffeine George

161
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:06,630
I i think that there was some natural
tension there

162
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:11,040
because this was us it was stepfather
Danny

163
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,510
was was naturally more taciturn more
self-contained

164
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:21,520
but he was always watching he was always
very very aware of what was going on

165
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:25,260
just as I was putting together a series

166
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,960
on different aspects of psychic
phenomenon for the station

167
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,610
Channel 5 News the story about the
Lutz's

168
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:36,770
and their experience in 112 Ocean Avenue

169
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:40,170
word the Amityville Horror houses it's
now come to be known

170
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:45,120
broke in New York Newsday everyone was
trying to get in touch with them

171
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,990
and it took me a couple of weeks nobody
knew where they were once they had done

172
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:52,310
a press conference they basically went
underground

173
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:56,580
I finally managed to leave messages for
them in track them down and

174
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:59,950
George Lutz called me and asked me if I
would come and meet with them because I

175
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,710
told them I have good contacts

176
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:05,260
in the field parapsychology so I did

177
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:08,990
go out and meet with George Lutz and his

178
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:13,280
family on surveying firm at the time we
had a nice conversation he took me back

179
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,220
to his mother in laws house

180
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:20,280
to meet cathy his wife and the three
kids that's where they were staying

181
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,310
and over the course of a five-hour
conversation where they told me about

182
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,630
their story they decided

183
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:30,880
that I was someone that they could trust
in that they would allow channel 5 tap

184
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,970
the exclusive on the story

185
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:37,839
so that's how it all started

186
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,020
on November 13th 1974

187
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:44,230
the house at 112 Ocean Avenue Amityville

188
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:47,600
became the site of a notorious mass
murder

189
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,000
23-year-old Ronald to fail junior shot
to death his father

190
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,640
mother two brothers and two sisters with
a 35 caliber Marlin rifle

191
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:02,400
all six victims were discovered by
police face-down in their beds

192
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,240
apparently unmoved and each murdered
while sleeping

193
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,210
good

194
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:14,230
toxicology reports approved the family
was not

195
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:18,010
thread no silencer had been used on the
weapon

196
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:22,790
lingering questions surrounding these
murders have remained for nearly forty

197
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:23,810
years

198
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:28,220
giving way to wild conspiracy theories
on whether or not to fail could have

199
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,930
committed these crimes alone

200
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:36,000
well at first just moving into the house
was fine it's a lovely house

201
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,200
and we enjoyed moving within a week

202
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,170
cathy's handed untouched by something
that we discussed

203
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:48,360
couldn't explain it was just something
unseen bills or to fly said

204
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,510
here to and Matt

205
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,149
coming times cal

206
00:13:53,149 --> 00:13:56,910
green the lots family purchased the
house

207
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:01,889
at the reduced prices eighty thousand
dollars very shortly after moving in

208
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:05,769
the family claim to have begun
experiencing mounting paranormal

209
00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:06,679
phenomena

210
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:10,859
cold spots were discovered randomly
throughout the house

211
00:14:10,859 --> 00:14:15,339
georgian Kathy claim to have witnessed
to red eyes peering in at them from the

212
00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:17,040
upstairs bedroom window

213
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,679
jolting sounds with wake the family
during the night

214
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:23,899
my son Danny hands work on

215
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:29,629
in the window in the sewing room and
they were flat and is

216
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:34,100
in just slammed I was was most in such a
way that his hands were actually to form

217
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,730
they were flat thing going downstairs
and found a calming down

218
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:41,910
is pretty much impossible gonna we've
and look at it and then is fine

219
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:45,660
it didn't occur to us until much later
that

220
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:51,489
house never really wanted us to leave
the family fled the house on january 14

221
00:14:51,489 --> 00:14:57,079
1976 none the subsequent families who
have lived in the house since

222
00:14:57,079 --> 00:15:01,910
have reported anything usual people we
talked to seem to feel that whatever was

223
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,129
the motive for this crime

224
00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:06,360
it had something to do with the family
it's not something that's going to

225
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,819
return to bother anyone else

226
00:15:07,819 --> 00:15:11,869
it will be interesting to see

227
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:15,619
what Danny feels after all these years
what's also

228
00:15:15,619 --> 00:15:18,720
I think fascinating is how much

229
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,029
love what he remembers actually happened
and how much

230
00:15:22,029 --> 00:15:27,069
in does he think what happened I knew
the child

231
00:15:27,069 --> 00:15:30,639
I don't know the man and yet Amityville

232
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,860
is a thread and actually something that
has defined

233
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:40,919
he and his siblings for their lives so
I'd like to know how is it impacting

234
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:45,399
you wanna see if he's come to terms

235
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:52,399
with that this he feels this is Israel
she

236
00:15:52,689 --> 00:15:56,079
do you mean good what you been up to for
the last thirty years

237
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:00,589
been hanging in here for a while ok said
last time I saw you

238
00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:04,319
you are helping your mother do dishes

239
00:16:04,319 --> 00:16:07,929
in the kitchen at the San Diego house
you came to San

240
00:16:07,929 --> 00:16:12,629
you yes one other things about the lots
is that struck me immediately was

241
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:15,730
they were not seeking publicity

242
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:19,269
they were very very normal they were
young suburban couple

243
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:23,579
the three kids were very very nice if
you know any better they were just like

244
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:24,779
the couple next door

245
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:28,159
I mean when you heard the story it
sounded like they had been visited by

246
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:32,399
just about every form a Paris
psychological play in existence

247
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,059
I offered to put them in touch with
Paris psychologist

248
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:40,419
like marine Warren they accepted that
and basically at that point they said

249
00:16:40,419 --> 00:16:41,029
okay

250
00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:46,029
now on anything we do you can have the
exclusive there are only two conditions

251
00:16:46,029 --> 00:16:49,579
one you could you don't go into the
house by yourself you go in with

252
00:16:49,579 --> 00:16:51,369
reputable Paris psychologist

253
00:16:51,369 --> 00:16:55,439
you know be great if you can get it
whole team up our psychologist in there

254
00:16:55,439 --> 00:16:58,759
so everybody to do their thing and read

255
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:02,230
0 what was ever in their to we wanted

256
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:05,600
our Privacy respect is what they asked
me and they definitely wanted the kids

257
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,569
kept down a bit

258
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:09,600
the family's privacy and you reporting
love

259
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,110

261
00:17:16,639 --> 00:17:19,959
you anything Danny oh I wish somebody
would have

262
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:23,389
what happened well but you are a minor
child

263
00:17:23,389 --> 00:17:27,879
and don't forget this very good at
speaking for myself what would you have

264
00:17:27,879 --> 00:17:29,760
said if you could have spoken for
yourself

265
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,029
are spread all told everything that
happened

266
00:17:33,029 --> 00:17:37,730
exactly the way it happened while it is
fresh in my mind as you can possibly be

267
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:40,980
now it's an interesting statement I mean

268
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,299
how fresh or dim is it your mind

269
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:47,299
now solve their I wish I could get were

270
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:52,120
us

271
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,389
said something that has been in my
dreams

272
00:17:55,389 --> 00:17:59,919
tire life Harry was going through

273
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,159
episode while the garage

274
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:06,779
was on the possession outcall

275
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:09,940
yeah job was going holistic

276
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:13,240
and torches to keep on a leash

277
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:18,029
in pair but it was just long enough for
him to jump over the fence

278
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:21,490
for I went out there to try to get

279
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:24,899
from whose

280
00:18:24,899 --> 00:18:28,869
fighting so much I was

281
00:18:28,869 --> 00:18:33,010
fairly strong enough to rolled back over
the fence

282
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:36,610
but that seems me has been

283
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:41,629
a reoccurring dream probably five
hundred

284
00:18:41,629 --> 00:18:45,929
time whatever life sometimes I would be
Harry sometimes

285
00:18:45,929 --> 00:18:51,379
Harry would be me sometimes I tried to
kill him sometimes he tried to kill me

286
00:18:51,379 --> 00:18:55,610
times there was nothing wrong with the
garage other times I thought I knew what

287
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:56,230
was wrong

288
00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:01,119
the garage I mean I wasn't there for a
while

289
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:05,179
again it's never about dreams about the
emotions

290
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:11,260
fled it's kind of hard for me to explain
to some people

291
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:14,950
I would like to think that find a guide

292
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:19,029
Arctic trying to explain gap which

293
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:22,740
I don't I could just bring up I had

294
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:27,669

00:20:26,419 --> 00:20:30,020
to be I figured it was big enough to
keep George do away from me and

311
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,850
everybody had enough room in

312
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:35,460
you know this is this is pretty cool

313
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,879
I could work with us

314
00:20:38,879 --> 00:20:45,879
moving and a we go

315
00:20:46,639 --> 00:20:51,580
a this was a self move this was the
family pack to drop factor on boxes if

316
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:56,119
it breaks it's your fault cuz you look
back box right by the time

317
00:20:56,119 --> 00:21:00,460
we've got Amityville was mid-morning

318
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:04,779
an 11 something like that my job was

319
00:21:04,779 --> 00:21:08,440
was just to to haul boxes that said

320
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:14,139
I helped back to drop in on one pack
drop and I ran down to the bone yard and

321
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:17,179
ran up to the top 10 couldn't believe

322
00:21:17,179 --> 00:21:20,849
this is like on the water with Paul kids
in the pool

323
00:21:20,849 --> 00:21:25,099
boat house in I got right inside the
front door

324
00:21:25,099 --> 00:21:28,340
and i'm looking at this picture right
here where you can see straight up the

325
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,220
staircase

326
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,429
ran all the way up to see how far the
house would call when

327
00:21:33,429 --> 00:21:38,429
slight literally twice as big as
anything else we had looked at

328
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:43,139
I loved it thought it was great soldier
move

329
00:21:43,139 --> 00:21:46,529
I'll maybe a quarter of the way into the
truck

330
00:21:46,529 --> 00:21:49,919
father ratios up

331
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,869
but I song come n

332
00:21:53,869 --> 00:21:58,210
I was in the truck dump on boxes of at
that point a

333
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:02,559
I wanted to know which was my room cuz I
wanted father rate to come to my room to

334
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,749
good also my wrong so

335
00:22:05,749 --> 00:22:09,669
did your mom just call him over to left
the house

336
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:13,639
lot of people will do that that's just a
normal occurrence

337
00:22:13,639 --> 00:22:16,940
so when did you start really feeling
that

338
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:22,409
a sense about ease okay the until the
first two hours being in the house I

339
00:22:22,409 --> 00:22:24,749
mean I was confused with the whole
father Ray

340
00:22:24,749 --> 00:22:28,320
in areas and he's getting this holy
water in the Far Niente page in the

341
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,840
Bible he went in the house around a good
boxes at dropped in

342
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:37,109
you're talking with my mom and and I go
back down get another box but I'm afraid

343
00:22:37,109 --> 00:22:38,159
he's gone

344
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,440
well had you met you had met I didn't
even speak tool

345
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,019
mom what if I the rain leaf what's going
on

346
00:22:45,019 --> 00:22:48,090
and she said I don't know but played you
know

347
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:53,950
he'll be back I will see him on Sunday
subsequently the next box was to go up

348
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,080
to the playroom

349
00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:00,139
and when I went in there there was
problem

350
00:23:00,139 --> 00:23:04,580
she for a five hundred flies

351
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,600
and we're talking this is made December

352
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,999
Long Island

353
00:23:08,999 --> 00:23:10,520
yeah I started gallon

354
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,580
mom came running up stairs and she
stopped screaming

355
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:17,150
nervous it finally started clicking

356
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:21,040
in her mind I'm not sure what it was why
father Ray just left

357
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:26,730
I would stand there with the newspaper
smashing them on the wall and smashing

358
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,000
them on the window

359
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,390
and knowing that in five minutes I just
killed about a hundred flies

360
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:38,250
I went downstairs tell Mom to have a
calm of to be all proud skilled flies

361
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:43,910
and the dead flies are gone she would
look at me and say but did you do

362
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:48,130
you did what

363
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:53,030
where's the newspaper puts and I just
left a newspaper on the floor

364
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:56,530
was too dead flies

365
00:23:56,530 --> 00:24:00,360
and

366
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:07,360
that's when my confusion started when
did you start

367
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,840
feeling sensing any unease

368
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,170
or what was the offer and my mother was
is it would could not she was able to

369
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:18,990
describe

370
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:22,940
anything if I walked in I said mom what
strong she would tell me immediately

371
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,220
what's going on

372
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:28,510
and she wouldn't keep things from I'll

373
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:32,520
and now she's keeping secrets from and I

374
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,700
those mom I told we had disagreements
here and

375
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:42,040
she which given me these bullshit
excuses

376
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:47,140
or not answering passing of that I wanna
know what's going on

377
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:51,430
the housing to react differently or
people reacted differently

378
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:56,050
to the house your mother said she had a
feeling

379
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:59,980
love peace and didn't even want to go
out to do

380
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:03,120
normal chores and things

381
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,520
george always said he couldn't get warm
and he was

382
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:10,690
admitted to becoming more aggressive

383
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:14,440
and then om one of the things that they

384
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,490
there's a whole list of things that they
told me about that I'm

385
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:21,929
put bullet points here there was subtle
personality changes

386
00:25:21,929 --> 00:25:26,920
in all the family members basically that
olive you were affected you had

387
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:31,370
very short tempers violence was
commonplace

388
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:35,600
and they said that one point and George
that this

389
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,920
that he and Kathy took wooden spoons

390
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:42,630
to you and your brother and sister om

391
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:46,330
and beat them with that one night and or
did you guys around the house

392
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:49,580
like drill sergeants you recall that

393
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:52,750
yet while that happens

394
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:55,850
probably fifty times after that to
solvents

395
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:59,510
didn't happen work did have before you
moved into the house it happened a

396
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:02,730
couple times in George's house before we
move to Amityville

397
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:07,050
do you think because he had no parent
skills and he was only ever

398
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:11,570
yeah marine that's how we know how to
handle things I said this is going to be

399
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,330
a cakewalk

400
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:17,260
did you try and protect you from or were
you expecting her to protect you

401
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:20,350
no actual on my mother to protect

402
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:24,390
me fun I'm here to protect

403
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:27,790
her from you I had to

404
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:32,510
speak to George InSAR and call him
George

405
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:35,890
call only mister lots or so

406
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:40,700
you had to call mister lots for sure but
that when he was your stepfather

407
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,830
so to move on

408
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:47,650

409
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:52,840

another at a molecular

of

424
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:05,320
talking about white stuff where you are
right now

425
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:09,340

point like stone

430
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:29,810
I know I'm gonna say fifty percent of
the neighborhood on a first name basis

431
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:35,070
that was one of the reasons I was able
to stick around in this town

432
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,230
after them

433
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:41,100
movies came now everything went public
people know me as Greg

434
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,590
economy is believed people know me as
game why

435
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:48,590
well because my name was that in this
movie and then my name was

436
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:53,250
sack that way my name like that that
movie was making sure if I didn't tell

437
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,970
you the story that's they just thought

438
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:58,669
and the girl downstairs said ticket from
Amityville you and

439
00:28:58,669 --> 00:29:02,270
hates that's weird for you

440
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:06,179
yeah in the end the they don't know
until I give them the answer

441
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:10,290
yeah so this would be like a daily
confusion Dane I learned a lot from you

442
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,340
think of yourself as the Amityville

443
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:16,120
guy when you think private inside
yourself

444
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,370
because I am The Amityville rise I it's
not

445
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:22,900
that like who you think of yourself as
first thought no ok and Danny

446
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:26,870
okay okay so it's not your first thought
about you and and you're talking to

yeah annual bodyguard right all I do is
walk around protecting that generated

449
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:36,610
that's right exactly that's what I keep
thinking that you have worked so hard

450
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:41,640
to be yourself whereas most people just
get to be themselves

451
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:46,630
you know there's a wanna says ProCare

to the left the time mister war into the
dining room there's the cage

474
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:23,020

475
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:27,060
twenty degrees difference 5

476
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:31,000

477
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,590
with the Alliance head picture

478
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:37,650
is next to the bathroom a

479
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:40,810
on the second floor the very shocked or

480
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:44,250
that platform staircase and

481
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:47,920
all spots hidden change

482
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:52,540
there was what I observed happens

483
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:57,170
in the beginning is not something that

484
00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:00,530
just one person saw the entire family
standing there

485
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:05,160
watching the fuck garage door slam up
and slammed down and slam

486
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,470
up and slammed down and the dog is
fucking himself

487
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:13,830
so I would go out there with George he
would pick me up and I would do

488
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:17,460
I would be hanging off one side of the
door and he would be pulling down on the

489
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,710
other side of the door

490
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:22,480
and we'd get in we block everything back
up with the Haus

491
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,570
we're going back into the house

492
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:28,680
my sister's room was above the pool

493
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,410
in the back yard to the right what did
you see

494
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:36,640
holes in the wind it would have been
what looked like Inc

495
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,670
cartoon character I love a

496
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:44,070
a

497
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:46,490
and angry pegged

498
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:49,879
with like wolf like teeth

499
00:32:49,879 --> 00:32:52,050
and red eyes

500
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:57,130
laser beam red eyes

501
00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:01,270
and at that closing the door seeing this
from my sister's room

502
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:04,300
I ran into the house faster than george
did

503
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:07,350
mated upstairs to her room and

504
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:14,350
the rocking chair shit in there back and
George went into a room in share

505
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:21,690
up and he's looking at the chairman is
looking at the legs in you

506
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:25,800
thing on the floor and there's no
logical explanation why this rocking

507
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:31,390
chair is good doing this for 25

508
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:36,169
I'd think it was a force that was beyond
my control

509
00:33:36,169 --> 00:33:39,729
I believe that there is a such thing as
evil and I think that it can manifest

510
00:33:39,729 --> 00:33:43,139
itself in any way shape or form that it
chooses

511
00:33:43,139 --> 00:33:46,190
at will and I was a victim to that

512
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:53,190
what you believe I don't believe i won
90 up

513
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,590
I know thats so others past rights

514
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:05,149
right talking standing right there

515
00:34:05,149 --> 00:34:08,639
issued that was like

516
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,470
the most horrible that person and that's

517
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:15,500
house nope

518
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:20,190
I had just gotten in a fight with George
drop

519
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:23,730
so but I got you second landing

520
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:29,480

521
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,950
why I I was project

522
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:38,549
up the stairs into the wall others like
15 cheap

523
00:34:38,549 --> 00:34:42,109
stand-up

524
00:34:42,109 --> 00:34:45,290
and my body

525
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:52,099
just like starts I no longer have
control of myself

526
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:55,710
I'm standing on the floor

527
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:59,109
look at my mother I don't know what's
course doesn't know what to say to pay

528
00:34:59,109 --> 00:35:02,559
and she jumps around

529
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:06,960
shock like something just scraped or

530
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,319
touched or help character

531
00:35:10,319 --> 00:35:16,510
Jimmy through me I have to describe what
it felt like a weepy

532
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:20,589
like and on this after being shocked

533
00:35:20,589 --> 00:35:24,549
somewhere in the rule

534
00:35:24,549 --> 00:35:30,779
which each

535
00:35:30,779 --> 00:35:34,450
was like Shop Hop page like

536
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:40,440
with a cargo crackled and that stuck
with me

537
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,049
at least a decade daily basis

538
00:35:44,049 --> 00:35:47,630
anybody ever saw me with the Tier II

539
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:53,900
edge like not should my mother

540
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:57,380

541
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:01,140

542
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:08,140

George

546
00:36:25,109 --> 00:36:28,930
and myself you feel that you were
possessed

547
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:33,890
I was a yeah I think that would happen
at some point was

548
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:38,009
extremely so far beyond my control

549
00:36:38,009 --> 00:36:41,969
yeah you mean in terms of your violence
towards to work his towards you

550
00:36:41,969 --> 00:36:48,969

557
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:23,070
men were infested with violent reactions
while women Kathy said

558
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:27,640
were charmed by the house and overcome
with the feeling was sedated

559
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,160

down the Christmas decorations

windows and the doors

570
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:09,420

621
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:39,180
so that pinky see it still film from

622
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:46,180
that still sent did they take you to the
doctor

623
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:50,830
my assignment that's every night March
1976 was to stay in the house

624
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:55,940
report on any unusual activity a number
psychics parapsychology is clear way in

625
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,970
so that the man I love this were also
there

626
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:02,840
determine once and for all about house
was possessed by some demonic forces

627
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:06,650
georgian Kathy Lutz yes the the channel
five news about the earlier

628
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:09,920
if there was a demonic force in the
house that watched by the sir

629
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,360
he did not manifest itself physically
why we the psychic suggest that the

630
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:17,280
house had been neutralized the
atmosphere not right at the moment

631
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,720
that perhaps the demons well they were
scared off by the crowd

632
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,710
that our cameras self effort that was a
landfill

633
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:28,530
I came out on camera in our newsroom

634
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:32,200
away I might add the piece like this of
anime

635
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:36,460
asked if I was scared during my night at
the house at 112 Ocean Avenue

636
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:41,090
no I was not it would be more accurate
to me to say

637
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:44,810
that the two hours I spent watching the
movie Friday night

638
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:48,200
with rowdy disruptive pot-smoking
audience

639
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:53,390
was much more of our the six hours I
spent that house at that would leave

640
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:56,590
trouble film looks as though we're
convinced

641
00:42:56,590 --> 00:43:00,690
themselves and they took to mend at
tremendous personal cost

642
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:05,460
we wanted to find a story we wanted to
believe them they came across

643
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:09,230
as very sincere irradiated the story

644
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:13,550
which we headed to quickly get on the
air I went back and looked at

645
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:16,820
every for that film there was nothing on

646
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:21,590
film except the people who were on the
telling their story the thing that

647
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:25,280
I would find the Los curious thing the
night

648
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,290
that I was there would be the sensation

649
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:31,370
bill place the metropolis cameraman's at
the Blue

650
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:34,980
he had these palpitations miss them and
would covered so

651
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:38,750
serious assignments war zones Ryan's and
any

652
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:42,320
so the was overcome by something and he
could not explain

653
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,990
he said he had no heart condition but he
climb the steps

654
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:49,750
sup stop camera down and

655
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:53,730
I'll explain another the unexplainable
lol I do recall

656
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:58,400
Lorraine Warren when she went to trance
saying it was a demonic force from deep

657
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,860
in the bowels of the earth

658
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:03,420
love it wasn't the sewing room yes the
sewing room

659
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:07,980
was the room which supposedly has the
story has it where the

660
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:12,120
demonic force was supposed to be the
strongest all the rain 1 I'm you we went

661
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:12,850
upstairs

662
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:16,010
we sat on the sewing room we have amble
going

663
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:21,710
I remember rain that she had never felt
such a force that she felt that night it

664
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:23,680
was like feeling like she was in hell

665
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:27,380
the rain also produced photograph which

666
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:32,320
claims that there is the image oh boy
this is one of the pictures that their

667
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,030
photographer took that night

668
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:37,530
you and I both know that there were no
children and no animals in the house

669
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:40,650
that night think look at it but then
again try

670
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:44,120
for great photographed think it's

671
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:51,120
the let's look at the countryside for
just what I know I'm not arguing at the

672
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,980
Greek and disputing anything I've been
in the house I was there the night of

673
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:54,600
the murders

674
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:58,700
I have the Weber interview that
supposedly expose the whole thing

675
00:44:58,700 --> 00:44:59,310
alright so

676
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:03,530
we've all been involved extensively what
there's no argument there

677
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:07,190
but what about the arguments that
surface

678
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:10,280
from one source for the other that for
example

679
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,880
reason they had to leave the house is
because they

680
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:17,610
let it foreclose they just didn't have
the money was more money let the land

681
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:21,940
serving business was just not doing very
well and then he has a cell house

682
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:24,980
couldn't sell house had to get out
couldn't pay it

683
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:28,220
as as a as a starting point will talk
about

684
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:32,690
okay and I starting point well I wasn't
privy to their finances run

685
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:35,890
however they got the house for

686
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:39,480
eighty thousand dollars a purchase price
of with the possessions

687
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:43,230
you can always assume that this realtor
Salam

688
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:46,990
house up must at some point if they
didn't already know that this

689
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:50,040
in for this he just didn't think so it
was amazing

690
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:53,610
so they did okay didn't know essays
makes it even worse they did

691
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:57,230
not only do you know that it's that it
was a scene of a mass murder now the

692
00:45:57,230 --> 00:46:00,340
your the belongings affect now

693
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:03,900
couple get let's play let's play devil's
advocate for one second I'll

694
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:08,100
I've heard all the stories about they
got into financial straits

695
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:12,670
but how could you could they didn't have
enough time to get that far behind

696
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:16,040
if they were only in the house for 28
days

697
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:19,250
now as to the point could he have been

698
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:23,740
dreaming up a scheme yeah absolutely
could have

699
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:26,770
did you did you have pics could you find
any evidence

700
00:46:26,770 --> 00:46:30,220
that he understood the local
supernatural before they moved into the

701
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:30,780
house

702
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:34,030
that but George what specifically what
George Lutz

703
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:37,240
always maintained to me

704
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:40,680
was that he was a non-practicing
methodist

705
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:44,790
the rumors that I've heard second third
fourth hand

706
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:49,300
over the years with that he had had an
abiding interest in the occult

707
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:53,620
I think that lots triggered something of
by being open to it

708
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:56,880
by previous activity possibly on

709
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:01,190
the part over money to fail they were
fooling around and got themselves in

710
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:04,420
very deep was something dark and
something evil

711
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:07,859
that they totally didn't understand know
where they were

712
00:47:07,859 --> 00:47:11,200
you know we were invited by the crime
groups to come

713
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:15,030
after the much is left the family then
moved in

714
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:19,240
and I'll this was in December a77

715
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:23,130
so we went through the entire place took
pictures we took infrared pictures

716
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:26,450
and I had a psychic one man covering up

717
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:30,630
living that I've worked with for many
many years Ceron make a right walks the

718
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:31,830
halls

719
00:47:31,830 --> 00:47:35,359
but it's what you think said while and I
said

720
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:40,300
walked and he said tensile ritual much
it costs

721
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:44,570
homes she was with the lots involved in
ritual magic

722
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:48,859
this was all about black magic being
done in this house

723
00:47:48,859 --> 00:47:53,240
and he fell the residual effect South
with the psychological

724
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:56,340
lose Natori experiences that people
thought were real

725
00:47:56,340 --> 00:48:00,330
but they're not really real our parent
only induced

726
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:03,640
do or allegations that he knew more
about you called them the the

727
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:04,650
supernatural

728
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:10,810
before they moved in than he's admitted
or wherever did admit this life

729
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:13,750
haiti's review had any experience before
they're called

730
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:17,680
with the supernatural ever before we can
believe in I was

731
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,850
purposely nosing into george's business
but

732
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:24,710
but there were things when you walked
into george's house

733
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:28,890
it wasn't inviting and welcoming if you
read his

734
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:31,960
a bookcase

735
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:35,550
you know would range from

736
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:39,020
transcendental meditation to Buddhism

737
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:42,700
satanic history mind

738
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:46,690
control typeof auction hypnosis

739
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:49,910
books sky was into some pretty dark
stuff

740
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:53,140
when I started thumbing through these
books in

741
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:57,210
they're sacrificing virgins devil
worship

742
00:48:57,210 --> 00:49:01,170
rallies you know shit like this and I'm
reading this in the book

743
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:04,380
and I walk over to my mother and she
just

744
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:07,850
crack me over the head said put this
back and don't take it off the shelf

745
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:11,570
and I looked at her and I said
absolutely not

746
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:14,610
you marry this guy you move me to his
house

747
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:21,000
what the hell is he into stupid menfolk

748
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,940
george was not right

749
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:28,320
that you can see that the dead to fear
in the kids

750
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:31,810
and then acknowledgement of

751
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:35,750
if he's president their Jeff

752
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:38,940
you know and everyone was I believe

753
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:42,070
I once I can said there was

754
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:46,810
a lot of fear and anxiety in our house
about it there's something about his

755
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:47,960
presence that made

756
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:52,600
30 as child

757
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:57,870
know something is of with this man not
write something

758
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:01,070
not good I think that

759
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:03,390
certain people can

760
00:50:03,390 --> 00:50:08,460
trigger things and in this case I think
that whatever happened

761
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:11,779
after round to fail murdered his family

762
00:50:11,779 --> 00:50:16,799
I think it lingered there and I think I
was felt the George lots

763
00:50:16,799 --> 00:50:19,819
was the trigger for

764
00:50:19,819 --> 00:50:25,579
what started to happen to that family in
Warren always talked about certain

765
00:50:25,579 --> 00:50:27,259
people when we were in the house

766
00:50:27,259 --> 00:50:30,430
the night of March 6 there were a couple
people there

767
00:50:30,430 --> 00:50:33,549
that it said we're going from room to
room

768
00:50:33,549 --> 00:50:36,680
antagonizing the house or the spirits

769
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:41,569
well I called the Warrens up what are

00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:38,470
you three kids for a walk on the beach
and that's when you can just walked

815
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:42,210

00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:54,660
and they went about noises and they were
talking

819
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:58,049
about how he would stand at the top of
the stairs

820
00:53:58,049 --> 00:54:02,640
and in yell and scream about marching
bands

that we're downstairs and runs for all
rolled up

822
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:10,299
do you think that George triggered

823
00:54:10,299 --> 00:54:15,099
whatever was in the house that it was
attracted to him almost like

824
00:54:15,099 --> 00:54:19,040
his personality it and

825
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:22,510
it's a strong possibility it is

826
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:25,930
a strong possibility but you

827
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:29,240

it through this this was with add

947
01:02:12,170 --> 01:02:15,320
all the time in the hospital it never

948
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:18,940
truly recovering I brought him home

949
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:25,940
unit for years in

950
01:02:30,570 --> 01:02:31,590
what would you

951
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:35,650
say to somebody who says okay this kid
obviously

952
01:02:35,650 --> 01:02:38,930
has a big problem with his stepfather

953
01:02:38,930 --> 01:02:43,010
but that's not so unusual they could put
it down to okay you've now got a blended

954
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:44,750
family and it's not the Brady Bunch

955
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:49,830
aka okay Danny skipping school he's
doing whatever he can to

956
01:02:49,830 --> 01:02:54,540
be defiant there was a small part of me
that look forward to get in trouble and

957
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:55,910
would do anything

958
01:02:55,910 --> 01:02:59,310
you know you cats like when

959
01:02:59,310 --> 01:03:03,750
there was anger in the house more shit
was going on in the house

960
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:08,820
the more dramatic in the more
dysfunctional it got

961
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:13,200
the worst sitka did you feel like the
energy was feeling of love your

962
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:16,710
aggressions tension yes yes I've

963
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:20,150
that's come up many times in life long
therapy yes

964
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:23,869
and has anybody ever said to you okay
Danny maybe this is just manifestations

965
01:03:23,869 --> 01:03:25,610
baby you imagined all this

966
01:03:25,610 --> 01:03:31,240
maybe use in the coolidge to well what
do you say when somebody says that

967
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:34,480
get up and I won't go and discuss

968
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:37,930
I stopped trying to persuade people
about

969
01:03:37,930 --> 01:03:41,970
okay really long time ago

970
01:03:41,970 --> 01:03:45,660
what they could put tell me what makes
you so sure

971
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:52,500
so convinced that this really happened
to you that you didn't

972
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:56,280
a mat that its you didn't imagine it and
I'm sure you've had those

973
01:03:56,280 --> 01:04:01,760
those feelings were you saying OK
three-part second-guessing myself

974
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:05,140
yeah but is there any has there ever
been any point in time were you saying

975
01:04:05,140 --> 01:04:05,740
OK

976
01:04:05,740 --> 01:04:09,920
I was an angry Kid I'm

977
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:14,060
really ticked off did you ever doubt
yourself

978
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:17,230
that this happened no

979
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:21,440
DG never had a point yells at all to
clear an all too real and

980
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:24,880
what I saw I know I saw and I could
describe it to you twenty years from now

981
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:26,600
exactly like I did right now

982
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:30,359
nothing's gonna change did you have any
sense that whatever

983
01:04:30,359 --> 01:04:34,109
was there was would follow you

984
01:04:34,109 --> 01:04:40,570
of the property

985
01:04:40,570 --> 01:04:43,990
when did that start to happen

986
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:46,970
well one around involves both

987
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:53,970
on school

988
01:05:09,830 --> 01:05:12,240
my mother and three of us were basically

989
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:15,290
heaped which george was injured as

990
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:22,290
is personal right and then

991
01:05:22,310 --> 01:05:26,370
only slowly he was he watching entering
shop

992
01:05:26,370 --> 01:05:29,880
world as we met him he was involved

993
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:33,460
his believes that which practiced

994
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:37,290
one is to be able to control somebody
else's

995
01:05:37,290 --> 01:05:42,400
mines is to be able to keep object
masterful

996
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:45,870
heart

997
01:05:45,870 --> 01:05:49,540
I'd talk top

998
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:53,410
I think somewhere along the line that

999
01:05:53,410 --> 01:05:57,010
George beliefs and practices and things
that he was

1000
01:05:57,010 --> 01:06:02,820
directly involved with triggered in was
a catalyst to what was going on

1001
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:05,950
house was kinda like a magic trick gone
bad

1002
01:06:05,950 --> 01:06:10,950
control of what was involved with laying
of hands

1003
01:06:10,950 --> 01:06:16,300
and and recall that when you can move
objects with the mind in woods

1004
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:20,300
telekinesis kinases thought projections
and

1005
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:23,840
when did this start to since

1006
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:27,490
first minute I walked into his house in
realize

1007
01:06:27,490 --> 01:06:32,140
should two sons pixels well I mean if
you walked into my eye

1008
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:36,700
if you walked into my house and you look
to my bookcase you would pretty much

1009
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:41,760
see a lot love things on accusations by
rivals with bookmarks and

1010
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:46,720
pictures you photographed all on wall
but I have a lot of books on site on

1011
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:47,830
various aspects

1012
01:06:47,830 --> 01:06:51,650
love parapsychology the the supernatural

1013
01:06:51,650 --> 01:06:55,160
I have a couple books on with witchcraft
and magic but let's face it

1014
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:58,020
I mean what do you think the chances
realistically what do you think the

1015
01:06:58,020 --> 01:06:58,910
chances were

1016
01:06:58,910 --> 01:07:02,440
that no matter how many books George
read that he was going to be able to

1017
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:04,100
start moving objects with asthma

1018
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:07,600
I witnessed you witnessed what

1019
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:10,610
exactly george's ability to move

1020
01:07:10,610 --> 01:07:13,980
objects with out touch them with his
mind

1021
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:17,500
in his garage before we even got there

1022
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:21,630
he was in the garage with his friends

1023
01:07:21,630 --> 01:07:24,670
you can ranches just like that

1024
01:07:24,670 --> 01:07:27,820
like this walk over with them down

1025
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:31,810
takes them a couple minutes to get there
it takes about 12 is gone

1026
01:07:31,810 --> 01:07:36,840
and it would take about a minute to drop
it by he kindling

1027
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:40,740
and I was not supposed to know their
search which tumbled in on an

1028
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:41,720
after-school

1029
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:45,200
my mother didn't know I'm run into their

1030
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:49,070
I don't know I didn't know if she knew
at that time my way told she looked to

1031
01:07:49,070 --> 01:07:51,970
me like what

1032
01:07:51,970 --> 01:07:55,840
colder out into the garage and I want
you to show my mom what you just did

1033
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:56,410
right now

1034
01:07:56,410 --> 01:08:01,780
and the guys got all and last didn't say
a word

1035
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:05,910
and I have a doctors appointment at
night to I when I told the doctor

1036
01:08:05,910 --> 01:08:12,110
second by second where didn't offer an
explanation

1037
01:08:12,110 --> 01:08:17,840
he just kept praised we think he said

1038
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:21,000
role he had conversation

1039
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:25,420
for drop me off using comes in 15
minutes later they talk for another 20

1040
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:25,850
minutes

1041
01:08:25,850 --> 01:08:30,660
go at this point I with the doctor I
would recommend it to your mother

1042
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:33,900
find a new boyfriend or he

1043
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:37,270
he needs your son needs to go for tester

1044
01:08:37,270 --> 01:08:43,350
something this is this is just an
incredible tale from

1045
01:08:43,350 --> 01:08:47,060
there's a doctor out there somewhere
with

1046
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:50,430
that story in his file in handwriting

1047
01:08:50,430 --> 01:08:54,270
people

1048
01:08:54,270 --> 01:08:58,350
can exaggerate what they've experienced

1049
01:08:58,350 --> 01:09:03,270
they can exaggerate a little or
exaggerate a lot they can add details to

1050
01:09:03,270 --> 01:09:06,140
an experience to make the story more
interesting

1051
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:09,260
%ah and that there are lots of reasons
why

1052
01:09:09,260 --> 01:09:13,580
people might do that I mean for one
thing a we remember

1053
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:17,520
bits and pieces have experience but will
fill in the gaps in our memory

1054
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:21,600
with other bits of information things we
learned from other places

1055
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:26,420
inferences we drew which we decide
probably happen and we use those two

1056
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:32,210
fill in the gaps memory their also maybe
a motivation to remember things in a way

1057
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:34,400
that is a little bit more dramatic

1058
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:37,570
little bit more interesting now believes
that

1059
01:09:37,570 --> 01:09:40,580
saw his stepfather

1060
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:43,580
move objects without touching

1061
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:46,760
and the question and where did that come
from

1062
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:50,460
it might be a speculation that it could
have come from

1063
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:55,060
the stepfather saying you know I can do
this and the little boy started think I

1064
01:09:55,060 --> 01:09:56,560
I saw him do it

1065
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:59,880
and when the story start to change

1066
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:04,020
then it's time to become suspicious I be
afraid to be in that house

1067
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:07,500
knowing that there had been a mass
murder in again we go back to the whole

1068
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:08,220
thing about it

1069
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:11,970
what is the imagination why starring and
just take off

1070
01:10:11,970 --> 01:10:15,840
and then the influence a father feeling
this on children

1071
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:20,500
who I've been involved in so many these
cases with children are so sensitive

1072
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:23,510
not going to what's happening in an
environment possibly power normally

1073
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:26,580
but also to the Q's they get from their
parents

1074
01:10:26,580 --> 01:10:30,140
most people do not want the glare these

1075
01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:34,100
they do not wanting names we feel
because of their business associations

1076
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:36,310
and everything else I can be effected

1077
01:10:36,310 --> 01:10:39,640
they don't want to expose their children
very important

1078
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:43,020
to not any loving parent does not want
to

1079
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:47,680
inflict on a child anyone who does that

1080
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:51,230
is is demonic is the so-called forces
that were released in this case

1081
01:10:51,230 --> 01:10:58,230
psychological scars is something that
are hard to expose

1082
01:10:58,850 --> 01:11:02,130
and and share with people and

1083
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:06,270
while I'm an extremely emotional person
by nature and

1084
01:11:06,270 --> 01:11:11,990
that doesn't mean I like to share when
you watch him tell the stories he

1085
01:11:11,990 --> 01:11:16,410
he looks very believable and he tells
the story and away

1086
01:11:16,410 --> 01:11:20,540
that is almost guaranteed to get other
people to believe him

1087
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:25,380
its detail he's confident he expresses
it was a motion

1088
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:29,470
those are the things that people look to
you to decide that they're hearing an

1089
01:11:29,470 --> 01:11:30,700
authentic story

1090
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:34,780
in my opinion the suggestion with this
ten-year-old boy

1091
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:38,390
started when he was 10 helium

1092
01:11:38,390 --> 01:11:43,090
with adults who believed in the
paranormal who believed in the end call

1093
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:46,750
call perhaps were who had books on me
paranormal

1094
01:11:46,750 --> 01:11:50,430
telekinesis who may have been talking
about things

1095
01:11:50,430 --> 01:11:53,900
and then discussions family members
interviews

1096
01:11:53,900 --> 01:12:00,900
ok their site he soaked and suggestions

1097
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:10,680
I think one excellent example

1098
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:15,400
is this story about a priest coming to

1099
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:19,160
bless the house and then for five years
later

1100
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:22,810
there's a film that comes out which
shows that that priest

1101
01:12:22,810 --> 01:12:27,110
is overtaken by a swarm of flies and now

1102
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:30,480
this once 10-year-old boy now older

1103
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:33,760
has got a recollection remembering flies

1104
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:37,790
hundreds and hundreds of lives so did he
get that

1105
01:12:37,790 --> 01:12:40,790
from the post-event suggestion of the
film

1106
01:12:40,790 --> 01:12:47,790
%ah or not

1107
01:12:50,849 --> 01:12:54,809
the last night in the house when did you
leave

1108
01:12:54,809 --> 01:12:58,280
was a school day was a regular day
during week

1109
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:05,280
my brother and myself

1110
01:13:06,890 --> 01:13:10,510
share levitation experience in our
bedroom

1111
01:13:10,510 --> 01:13:14,910
in our beds this would be a arvit here

1112
01:13:14,910 --> 01:13:18,830
because my bed was on during

1113
01:13:18,830 --> 01:13:21,920
this window was bad news this way

1114
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:27,060
on that wall so we would be like toe to

1115
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:30,760

1118
01:13:43,710 --> 01:13:48,260

all their possessions there but the bank
foreclose on the house

scrutiny George wasn't working anymore

the country you know they wanted to

1143
01:15:19,170 --> 01:15:24,300
get as far away from Amityville as they
could we were looking for family therapy

1144
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:31,300

we can even talk about this in our own
house in Cornwall

1146
01:15:35,970 --> 01:15:39,430
with more logical explanations and

1147
01:15:39,430 --> 01:15:43,670
and now you wanna tell the world's

1148
01:15:43,670 --> 01:15:48,340

is

1153
01:16:04,610 --> 01:16:08,970
as a grade school student teaches your
movie was on last night

country I mean literally changed

1157
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:25,610

01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:34,630
not thing that's how we track their
movements burst through the meat

1161
01:16:34,630 --> 01:16:38,110
once the Amityville thing

1162
01:16:38,110 --> 01:16:43,000
happened in I started changing mentally
and emotionally

1163
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,780
I'm just redirected everything and
became hyper aggressive

1164
01:16:46,780 --> 01:16:50,360
apparently think I D large advanced

1165
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:54,680
to promotional torrent it was going to
be.

1166
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:59,550
for probably close to a year if not
maybe a little more or they're going on

1167
01:16:59,550 --> 01:17:00,240
this world

1168
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:02,359
swarm

1169
01:17:02,359 --> 01:17:06,559
wound up getting dumped off J Catholic
Church

1170
01:17:06,559 --> 01:17:11,040
monastery school

1171
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:14,140
I Caden authority problem I didn't care

1172
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:17,720
preach were beating the shit out of me
performing extensions

1173
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:23,970
which if I'm not mistaken they don't
want to talk about

1174
01:17:23,970 --> 01:17:27,040
tell me about that what I mean
performing exorcisms

1175
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:33,020
performing axis isms like speaking in
tongues laying on hands

1176
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:37,050
holy water splashing violent Falken

1177
01:17:37,050 --> 01:17:42,070
the bodily convulsions up

1178
01:17:42,070 --> 01:17:46,739
which five axis is and do I need to
explain why would they have done this

1179
01:17:46,739 --> 01:17:53,739
because I was possessed by a spirit that
I could not get rid of mining

1180
01:17:58,820 --> 01:18:02,170
so I ran away from the church a couple
times

1181
01:18:02,170 --> 01:18:05,910
priest free to share that I'd

1182
01:18:05,910 --> 01:18:08,990
said Georgian capital any communication
with you during this time

1183
01:18:08,990 --> 01:18:12,630
stumped you on I didn't talk to my
mother for probably the better part of

1184
01:18:12,630 --> 01:18:13,210
the year

1185
01:18:13,210 --> 01:18:17,130
in and to be honest but she showed up

1186
01:18:17,130 --> 01:18:24,130
I don't have much to say

1187
01:18:35,599 --> 01:18:38,999
in many ways it will follow you for a
long long long time to come

1188
01:18:38,999 --> 01:18:42,940
why did you go public full before we
went public

1189
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:47,880
some other people stand for us and

1190
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:50,600
widely exaggerated stories and this

1191
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:53,250
on

1192
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:56,810
in order to convict him those things

1193
01:18:56,810 --> 01:18:59,830
you to live with us sweet most

1194

1195
01:19:06,590 --> 01:19:09,930
that I no longer exist

1196
01:19:09,930 --> 01:19:13,910
I could not separate

1197
01:19:13,910 --> 01:19:17,850
reality from what was called

1198
01:19:17,850 --> 01:19:20,960
came points where

1199
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:26,830
it was like this family nightmare come
true I could not

1200
01:19:26,830 --> 01:19:29,960
to see it was almost like being awake in
your own tree

1201
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:34,710
but I used to hate living a lifestyle a
structured lights

1202
01:19:34,710 --> 01:19:37,760
all of a sudden you know

1203
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:41,580
in a matter of like six-month period

1204
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:44,670
this whole time you know

1205
01:19:44,670 --> 01:19:50,880

to know

1208
01:19:58,010 --> 01:20:02,930

1209
01:20:02,930 --> 01:20:06,510
probably ran away about a times for a
total

1210
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:12,880
about two years I would have been about

01:20:37,659 --> 01:20:41,869
Amityville experience for you that I
didn't get to tell my story the first

1218
01:20:41,869 --> 01:20:42,209
time

1219
01:20:42,209 --> 01:20:49,209
are there any silver linings in the
class anything come and have any deal

there a time

1222
01:21:01,519 --> 01:21:05,190
when the hauntings or the

1223
01:21:05,190 --> 01:21:09,150

control

1230
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:40,199

situations that are beyond your control

1231
01:21:40,199 --> 01:21:41,280
there is

01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:47,909
label we want to put our name you know
easel tomorrow

1234
01:21:47,909 --> 01:21:51,760
conspirator whatever the fuck you want
to call it it exists

1235
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:55,249
under whatever label you wanna put it on
and

1236
01:21:55,249 --> 01:21:59,219
sad thats

1237
01:21:59,219 --> 01:22:03,130
the hardest thing for me to do continued
with I

1238
01:22:03,130 --> 01:22:06,890
because I know that it's true and

1239
01:22:06,890 --> 01:22:08,260
it

1240
01:22:08,260 --> 01:22:12,310
in my feeling about it

1241
01:22:12,310 --> 01:22:16,910
has always the let's is may have
experience with item

1242
01:22:16,910 --> 01:22:20,820
what I call low-level param from some
other hallucinogenic

1243
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:24,330
something that noone whose engine so the
question becomes

1244
01:22:24,330 --> 01:22:28,690
let's say we could do this all over it
and let's say we kept the process an

1245
01:22:28,690 --> 01:22:29,770
investigator

1246
01:22:29,770 --> 01:22:33,090
went and talk to the Lexus and took that
testimony

1247
01:22:33,090 --> 01:22:37,550
could the ethical hard as we know it had
been spoke

1248
01:22:37,550 --> 01:22:41,780
my feeling is now I do even with the
back any fans have backdrop of those

1249
01:22:41,780 --> 01:22:42,560
mass murders

1250
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:47,460
your I do not belief based upon what the
Lexus claims that the experienced in

1251
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:48,130
that house

1252
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:53,440
would be enough to make this case now
nobody could have predicted

1253
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:56,810
what has instead so something happen

1254
01:22:56,810 --> 01:23:00,190
the question is why and the effect
psychologically

1255
01:23:00,190 --> 01:23:03,460
on the family I do believe the losses

1256
01:23:03,460 --> 01:23:08,320
believe that they experience something
that was unusual

1257
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:12,630
I wanted to believe the story I want to
find some evidence that it was true

1258
01:23:12,630 --> 01:23:15,640
as a reporter we are naturally very
skeptical

1259
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:18,970
and I C you know show me the evidence

1260
01:23:18,970 --> 01:23:22,650
and that night I saw no evidence
anything

1261
01:23:22,650 --> 01:23:28,270
that was unusual in that house I do
believe

1262
01:23:28,270 --> 01:23:31,700
that their forces out there that

1263
01:23:31,700 --> 01:23:35,450
are beyond comprehension of our normal
five senses

1264
01:23:35,450 --> 01:23:39,290
I think that there were other forces at
work and I think

1265
01:23:39,290 --> 01:23:43,510
it would be very very hard for

1266
01:23:43,510 --> 01:23:48,330
a boy who had just turned 10 years old
to distinguish between

1267
01:23:48,330 --> 01:23:52,450
in some cases fact fantasy reality

1268
01:23:52,450 --> 01:23:56,200
I think george's particular personality

1269
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:59,550
made him susceptible to that

1270
01:23:59,550 --> 01:24:02,630
and it fit of him what you think danny
is at right

1271
01:24:02,630 --> 01:24:06,390
blaming him for the haunting to take
place because Danny

1272
01:24:06,390 --> 01:24:10,260
blames george for taking his mother away
and for

1273
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:13,450
have it is convenient for him don't
think it's just convenient I think he

1274
01:24:13,450 --> 01:24:14,360
really believes it

1275
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:17,840
I mean in a sense there was a was a loss
of control

1276
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:21,410
very hard have gone through life

1277
01:24:21,410 --> 01:24:26,300
have in the past been trying to people
not believe you 90

1278
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:30,070
like a mouse exactly I totally
understand now why you can smash it

1279
01:24:30,070 --> 01:24:33,850
I just wanted somebody to believe me

1280
01:24:33,850 --> 01:24:40,850
right must make you feel crazy not
having people believe you

1281
01:24:53,850 --> 01:24:56,680
would you be willing this summit to a
lie detector test

1282
01:24:56,680 --> 01:25:02,330
a polygraph

1283
01:25:02,330 --> 01:25:04,719
I've been asked that many times

1284
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:11,719
and I've had doctors asked priests ask
me that my friends asked me

1285
01:25:12,930 --> 01:25:19,930
my ex-wife at that is there something

1286
01:25:20,230 --> 01:25:24,580

to tell you that you cannot believe more

1287
01:25:24,580 --> 01:25:25,100
