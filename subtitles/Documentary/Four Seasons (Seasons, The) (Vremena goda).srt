1
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,718
Every second bastard born
is fathered by a priest.

2
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,117
But in Utopia that couldn't be.

3
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,189
For why?

4
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,511
-For there the priests are very holy.
-Therefore very few.

5
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,030
Is it anything interesting, Matthew?

6
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,036
-Bless you, sir. I don't know.
-Bless you too, Matthew.

7
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,469
To be sure, we have
some holy priests in England.

8
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,790
-Oh, name some.
-Brother James.

9
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,112
Man's a simpleton.

10
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,198
It's from Cardinal Wolsey.

11
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,988
What's he want?

12
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,629
-Me.
-When?

13
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,590
Now.

14
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,513
In Hampton Court?
You won't be there by midnight.

15
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,754
-The King's business.
-Queen's business.

16
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,275
Mistress Anne Boleyn's business.

17
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,437
Well, it's all the Cardinal's business.

18
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,599
That's very true. And when the Cardinal
calls, you all come running, day or night.

19
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,558
What is the man? A butcher's son.

20
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,353
Chancellor of England, too.

21
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,829
No, that's his office. What's the man?

22
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,672
Surely, Your Grace,
when a man rises so high and so swiftly...

23
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,513
...we must think he was misplaced
in his origins.

24
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,394
That, at least,
was the opinion of Aristotle and....

25
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,437
A butcher's son and looks it.

26
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,030
His looks, yes, I give you his looks.

27
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,071
What was that you said, Richard?

28
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,111
Nothing, Sir Thomas, it was out of place.

29
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,431
And Wolsey's still a butcher.

30
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,276
And you're a member of the King's
High Council, not an errand boy.

31
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,952
That is why I must go.

32
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,960
The Duke would go
if the Cardinal called him.

33
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,829
I might.

34
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,592
I'll be back for breakfast.

35
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,549
Go to bed.

36
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,914
"Dear Lord, give us rest tonight,
or if we must be wakeful, cheerful.

37
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,318
"Careful only for our soul's salvation.
For Christ's sake. Amen."

38
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,471
And bless our lord, the King.

39
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,000
-"And bless our lord, the King."
-Amen!

40
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,719
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Goodnight, Your Grace.

41
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,312
Keep clear of Wolsey, Thomas.
He's a frightened man.

42
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,119
-Who is that?
-A young friend from Cambridge.

43
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,198
-What's he want?
-What do they all want? A position.

44
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,278
-Can you give him a position?
-Do you recommend him?

45
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,869
No.

46
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,671
-Sir Thomas.
-No.

47
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,350
-Did you recommend me?
-No.

48
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,709
Richard, I may have a position for you.

49
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,799
-What? What position?
-Not now, Richard. Tomorrow.

50
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,473
For you all, boatman.

51
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,434
Thank you, sir.

52
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,713
Sir Thomas is here, Your Grace.
Sir Thomas.

53
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,519
Master Cromwell.

54
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,836
You opposed me in the Council
this morning, Thomas.

55
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,959
Yes, Your Grace.

56
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,877
-You were the only one.
-Yes, Your Grace.

57
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,434
You're a fool.

58
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,473
Thank God there is only one fool
on the Council.

59
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,951
Why did you oppose me?

60
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,836
I thought Your Grace was wrong.

61
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,038
A matter of conscience.

62
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,395
You're a constant regret to me, Thomas.

63
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,549
If you could just see facts flat on...

64
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,677
...without that horrible moral squint.

65
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,230
With a little common sense,
you could have made a statesman.

66
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,515
The King.

67
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,517
Where's he been? Do you know?

68
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,714
I, Your Grace?

69
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,591
Spare me your discretion.

70
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,794
He's been to play in the muck again.

71
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,030
He's been to Mistress Anne Boleyn.

72
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,109
More, are you going to help me?

73
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,194
If Your Grace will be specific.

74
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,397
You're a plodder! All right, we'll plod.

75
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,077
The King wants a son.
What are you going to do about it?

76
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,199
I'm very sure the King needs no advice
from me on what to do about it.

77
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,310
Thomas, we're alone.
I give you my word, there's no one here.

78
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,709
I didn't suppose there was, Your Grace.

79
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,709
Do you favour a change of dynasty?
Do you think two Tudors are sufficient?

80
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,949
For God's sake, Your Grace!

81
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,396
Then he needs a son. I repeat,
what are you going to do about it?

82
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,714
I pray for it daily.

83
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,995
God's death, he means it.

84
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,877
That thing out there, at least she's fertile.

85
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,194
-But she's not his wife.
-No, Catherine's his wife...

86
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,511
...and she's barren as a brick.
Are you going to pray for a miracle?

87
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,113
There are precedents.

88
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,396
All right. Good. Pray by all means.

89
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:16,998
But in addition to prayer there is effort.
And my effort is to secure a divorce.

90
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,675
Have I your support, or have I not?

91
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,789
The Pope gave a dispensation,
so that the King might marry...

92
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,388
...his brother's widow for state reasons.

93
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:38,234
We are to ask the Pope to dispense with
his dispensation, also for state reasons?

94
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,390
I don't like plodding, Thomas. Well?

95
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,519
Then, clearly all we have to do is
to approach His Holiness and ask him.

96
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,637
I think we might influence
the decision of His Holiness.

97
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,395
By argument?

98
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,189
Argument certainly. And pressure.

99
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,513
Pressure, applied to the Church?
The Church has its church property.

100
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,635
Pressure.

101
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,396
No, Your Grace, I'm not going to help you.

102
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,277
Then goodnight, Master More.

103
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,190
Let the dynasty die with Henry Vlll
and we'll have dynastic wars again.

104
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,592
Blood-witted barons ramping the country
from end to end.

105
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,836
Is that what you want? Very well.

106
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,757
England needs an heir.

107
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,272
Certain measures, perhaps regrettable...

108
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,714
...perhaps not, there's much in the Church
which needs reformation, Thomas.

109
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,753
All right, regrettable.
But necessary to get us an heir.

110
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,754
Now, explain how you, as a councillor
of England, can obstruct these measures...

111
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,593
...for the sake
of your own private conscience.

112
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:06,269
I think that when statesmen forsake
their own private conscience...

113
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,834
...for the sake of their public duties...

114
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,475
...they lead their country
by a short route to chaos.

115
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,880
And we shall have my prayers
to fall back on.

116
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,599
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
To govern the country with prayers?

117
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,314
Yes, I should.

118
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,190
I'd like to be there when you try.

119
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,271
Who will wear this after me?

120
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:38,032
Who's our next chancellor?
You? Fisher? Suffolk?

121
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,550
-Fisher for me.
-Aye, but for the King?

122
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,032
What about my secretary,
Master Cromwell?

123
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,559
Cromwell. He's a very able man.

124
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,756
But?

125
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,675
Me rather than Cromwell.

126
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,351
Then, come down to earth.

127
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,274
Until you do...

128
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,471
...you and I are enemies.

129
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,759
As Your Grace wishes.

130
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,913
As God wills.

131
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,039
Perhaps, Your Grace.

132
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,877
More! You should have been a cleric!

133
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,398
Like yourself, Your Grace?

134
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,318
Goodnight, Sir Thomas.

135
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,229
Sir Thomas.

136
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,195
Sir Thomas.

137
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,395
Sir Thomas.

138
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,757
-What's this?
-From some grateful poor folk, in Leicester.

139
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,597
-Leicester?
-You do more good than you know, sir.

140
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,713
My daughter has a case, sir,
in the Court of Poor Man's Causes.

141
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,799
Baked apples, sir.

142
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,998
To sweeten my judgement.

143
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,951
I'll give your daughter the same judgement
I would give my own.

144
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,349
A fair one, quickly.

145
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,909
Bless you, sir.

146
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,515
I understand. Yes. I'll read it.
Yes. Thank you.

147
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,672
Good evening, Sir Thomas.

148
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,750
-I'll read it.
-It's an awkward case.

149
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,035
-I could illuminate it for you--
-I'll read it.

150
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,678
Just a moment or two....

151
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,669
Boat!

152
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:38,792
Sir?

153
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,669
Chelsea, sir?

154
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,749
Chelsea.

155
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,709
I expect you'll make it worth my while, sir.

156
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,076
-You've got a licence?
-Bless you, yes sir, I've got a licence.

157
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,628
-Well then, the fares are fixed.
-They are, sir.

158
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,274
Hampton to Chelsea downstream,
a penny halfpenny.

159
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,430
Chelsea to Hampton upstream,
a penny halfpenny.

160
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,875
Whoever makes the regulations
doesn't row a boat.

161
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,750
No. Threepence if you get me home
for breakfast.

162
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,068
Thank you, sir.

163
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,359
A nice cup, sir.

164
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:54,996
Yes.

165
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,598
That's worth money, sir.

166
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,028
Mind a way, sir.

167
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,628
Thank you, sir.

168
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,676
-Have you been here all night?
-Yes.

169
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,430
You said there was a post?

170
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:17,239
Yes. I'll offer you a post, with a house,
a servant and £50 a year.

171
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,629
What post?

172
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,952
At the new school.

173
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,789
A teacher!

174
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,718
Richard, no one's going to give you
a place at court.

175
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,749
Master Cromwell says
he'll do something for me.

176
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,389
Cromwell?

177
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,234
Well, if you know Cromwell
you don't need my help.

178
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,755
Sir Thomas?

179
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,034
If only you knew how much,
much rather, I had your help than his.

180
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,712
Not to a place at court.

181
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,635
Why not?

182
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,876
Look.

183
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,828
-What is it?
-It's a bribe!

184
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,472
"l am the gift of Averil Machin."

185
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,951
And Averil Machin has a lawsuit
in the Court of Requests.

186
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:16,351
Italian silver. Take it. No joke.

187
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,949
Thank you.

188
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,393
What will you do with it?

189
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:25,797
Sell it.

190
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,110
-And buy what?
-A decent gown!

191
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,396
But Richard, that's a little bribe.

192
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:37,353
At court they offer you all sorts of things,
home, manor houses, coats of arms.

193
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,474
A man should go
where he won't be tempted.

194
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:46,110
Why not be a teacher? You'd be
a fine teacher. Perhaps a great one.

195
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,557
-lf I was, who would know it?
-You! Your pupils. Your friends.

196
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,593
God. Not a bad public, that.

197
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,237
And a quiet life.

198
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,358
You say that.
You come from talking with the Cardinal.

199
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,749
Yes, talking with the Cardinal.

200
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,316
It's eating your heart out, isn't it?
The high affairs of state.

201
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,549
The divorce?

202
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,915
Boatman!

203
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,230
Sir?

204
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,874
-Take this gentleman to the New lnn!
-Right, sir.

205
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,279
Sir Thomas?

206
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,349
Thank you.

207
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,278
Be a teacher.

208
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,236
-Matthew.
-Sir.

209
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,151
-Lady Alice in bed?
-Yes, sir.

210
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,119
-Lady Margaret?
-No, sir.

211
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,391
The Master Roper's here, sir.

212
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,357
At this hour? Who let him in?

213
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,190
He's a hard man to keep out, sir.

214
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,711
Will wants to marry me, Father.

215
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,198
Well, he can't marry you.

216
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,551
Sir Thomas, I'm called to the Bar.

217
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,154
Oh, congratulations, Roper.

218
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,755
My family may not be at the palace,
but in the city--

219
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,190
There's nothing wrong
with your family, Will.

220
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,911
There's not much wrong with you.

221
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,071
Except you seem to need a clock.

222
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,358
I can buy a clock, sir.

223
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,079
Roper, the answer is no...

224
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,628
...and will be no as long as you're a heretic.

225
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,870
Now, that's a word I don't like,
Sir Thomas!

226
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,837
It's not a likeable word or thing.

227
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,390
The Church is heretical!
Dr. Luther's proved that to my satisfaction!

228
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,152
Luther is an excommunicate!

229
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,038
From a heretic Church!
Church? It's a shop!

230
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,551
-Salvation by the shilling! And divorces!
-Will, no!

231
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,712
-What I know, I'll say!
-You've no sense of the place!

232
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,558
He's no sense of the time.

233
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,678
Now listen well.

234
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,474
Two years ago you were
a passionate churchman.

235
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,437
Now you're a passionate Lutheran.

236
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,432
We must just pray
that when your head's finished turning...

237
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,636
...your face is to the front again.

238
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,114
-ls your horse here?
-No, sir, I walked.

239
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,719
Well, take a horse from the stables
and get back home.

240
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,549
Go along.

241
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,473
May I come again?

242
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,597
Yes. Soon.

243
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,478
Is that final, Father?

244
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,439
As long as he's a heretic, Meg,
that's absolute.

245
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,872
What did Wolsey want?

246
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,513
Nice boy, young Will.

247
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,069
Terribly strong principles, though.

248
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,553
Clumsy, too.

249
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,039
-You're very pensive.
-You're very gay.

250
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,033
Was it the divorce?

251
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,629
To bed.

252
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,718
They're a cantankerous lot, the Ropers.
Always swimming against the stream.

253
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,990
Old Roper was just the same--

254
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,471
You don't want to talk about it.

255
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,236
No.

256
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,755
-I'm sorry you were awakened, chick.
-I wasn't sleeping very deeply.

257
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,713
What did Wolsey want?

258
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,314
-Will Roper's been.
-Will Roper?

259
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,313
Yes, he's been here all night.
He wants to marry Meg.

260
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,834
-Why you don't beat that girl l--
-No.

261
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,830
She's full of education
and it's a delicate commodity.

262
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,748
Goodnight, Meg.

263
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,109
Goodnight.

264
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,839
Marry Meg. A lawyer's son.

265
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,672
Well, she's a lawyer's daughter.

266
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,112
Norfolk spoke of you
for Chancellor of England before he left.

267
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,791
Well, he's a dangerous friend then.

268
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,910
Wolsey's chancellor, God help him.

269
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,270
But Norfolk said, if Wolsey fell, you--

270
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,148
If Wolsey fell, the splash would swamp
a few small boats like ours.

271
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,629
No.

272
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,078
There'll be no new chancellors
while Wolsey lives.

273
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,794
The Duke of Norfolk,
Earl Marshal of England.

274
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,110
Have you any message for His Majesty?

275
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,038
If I had served God...

276
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,079
...one half so well as I've served my King...

277
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:37,313
...God would not have left me here,
to die in this place.

278
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,828
Thank God you're dying here.
The King would have you die in the Tower.

279
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,032
"l am straightly charged
by the King himself...

280
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,270
"...here openly to declare
how much all England...

281
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,470
"...is beholden to this man.

282
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:20,510
"And how worthy he is
to have the highest room in the realm.

283
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,834
"And how dearly
the King's grace doth love and trust him...

284
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,990
"...not only for much good council...

285
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,870
"...deliberate council,
but for better council yet...

286
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,194
"...that which is privy to the King's person.

287
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,311
"This same Sir Thomas More...

288
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,239
"...here made before you all to be...

289
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,473
"...Lord Chancellor of the Realm."

290
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,479
Calm yourself, Matthew.

291
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,152
Fetch Lady Alice.

292
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,678
That's very well.

293
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,752
My lady! The King!

294
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,550
Now remember, the visit's a surprise.

295
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,437
But he'll know we're expecting him--

296
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,159
It's a very great honour.
One friend calling on another.

297
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,832
What's he really coming for?

298
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,195
To talk about the divorce.
He wants an answer.

299
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,635
-But he's had his answer.
-He wants another.

300
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,675
Thomas!

301
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:10,514
Your Majesty does my house more honour
than I fear my household will bear.

302
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,716
No ceremony Thomas, no ceremony!

303
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,308
A passing fancy.
I happened to be on the river.

304
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,674
Look. Mud.

305
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,398
By heaven, what an evening.

306
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,118
Lady Alice,
I fear we came upon you unexpectedly.

307
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,668
Yes, Your Grace. Well, no, Your Grace.

308
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,110
Well, that is, we are ready to entertain--

309
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,509
This is my daughter Margaret, sire.

310
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,919
She's not yet had the honour
to meet Your Grace.

311
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,112
Why Margaret,
they told me you were a scholar.

312
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,518
Answer, Margaret.

313
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,359
Among women, I pass for one, Your Grace.

314
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,792
Can you dance, too?

315
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,993
Not well, Your Grace.

316
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,110
Well, I dance superlatively!

317
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,309
That's a dancer's leg, Margaret!

318
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,030
Lady Alice,
the river's given me an appetite.

319
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,157
If Your Grace would share
a very simple supper.

320
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,231
It would please me. Lead them in.

321
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,719
Thomas and I will follow.

322
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,119
Matthew.

323
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,715
My lords and gentlemen!

324
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,348
Margaret?

325
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,959
Your Grace?

326
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,598
Do you like music?

327
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,233
Yes, Your Grace.

328
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,472
They'll play to you.

329
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,549
Now, listen to this.

330
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,474
Sit down.

331
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,395
Be seated. No courtship, Thomas.

332
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,795
You're my friend, are you not?

333
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,309
Your Majesty.

334
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,834
Thank God I have a friend
for my chancellor.

335
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,832
Readier to befriend, I trust,
than he was to be chancellor.

336
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,036
My own knowledge of my poor abilities--

337
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,315
I will judge of your abilities.

338
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,189
Thomas?

339
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,998
You know that Wolsey named you
for chancellor?

340
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:11,079
Before he died, Wolsey named you,
and Wolsey was no fool.

341
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:15,110
He was a statesman
of incomparable ability, Your Grace.

342
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,514
Was he?

343
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,199
Was he so?

344
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,196
Then, why did he fail me?

345
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,472
It was villainy then.

346
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,349
Yes, villainy. Secret opposition, secret.

347
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,716
But deliberate, wilful,
meditated opposition.

348
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,234
Wanted to be pope to master me, Wolsey.

349
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,753
What is it? Thought!

350
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:43,118
Because I'm simple and plain and deal
with every man straightforwardly.

351
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,954
Because of that I say,
do they take me for a simpleton?

352
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:56,316
Wolsey was a proud man, Thomas.

353
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,873
Pride right through.

354
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,473
And he failed me.

355
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,797
Failed me in the one thing that matters,
then as now.

356
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,509
But look.

357
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,555
Be seated.

358
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,039
What an evening.

359
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,236
A man could fight a lion.

360
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,676
Some men could, Your Grace.

361
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,075
Thomas...

362
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,720
...touching this matter of my divorce.

363
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,270
Have you thought of it
since we last spoke?

364
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,395
Of little else.

365
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,277
Then you see your way clear to me?

366
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,113
That you should put away
Queen Catherine, sire?

367
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,351
Alas, as I think of it, I see so clearly...

368
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,432
...that I cannot come with Your Grace,
that my endeavour is...

369
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,839
...not to think of it at all.

370
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,229
Then you haven't thought enough!

371
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,269
Lilac.

372
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,398
We have them at Hampton.

373
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,032
Not so fine as this, though.

374
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,714
I'm in an excellent frame of mind.

375
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,829
Thomas, you must consider,
I stand in peril of my soul.

376
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,353
It was no marriage.

377
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,917
I have lived in incest
with my brother's widow.

378
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:24,675
Leviticus: "Thou shalt not uncover
the nakedness of thy brother's wife."

379
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,990
Leviticus. Chapter 18, verse 16.

380
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,877
Yes, Your Grace. But Deuteronomy--

381
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,871
Deuteronomy is ambiguous!

382
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,520
Your Grace, I'm not fitted
to meddle in these matters.

383
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,636
To me, it seems a matter for the Holy See--

384
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:39,315
Thomas, does a man need a pope
to tell him where he's sinned?

385
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,353
It was a sin.

386
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,832
God's punished me.

387
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,199
I've no son.

388
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,352
Son after son she's borne me.

389
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,318
All dead at birth, or dead within the month.

390
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,074
I never saw the hand of God
so clear in anything.

391
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,230
It's my bounden duty
to put away the Queen.

392
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,756
And all the popes, back to Peter,
shall not come between me and my duty!

393
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,589
How is it that you cannot see?
Everyone else does.

394
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,672
Then, why does Your Grace
need my poor support?

395
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,513
Because you're honest.

396
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,719
And what is more to the purpose,
you're known to be honest.

397
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,234
Those like Norfolk follow me
because I wear the crown.

398
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,630
Those like Cromwell follow
because they're jackals with sharp teeth...

399
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,836
...and I'm their tiger. A mass follows me...

400
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,797
...because it follows anything that moves.

401
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,434
And then there's you.

402
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,835
I am sick to think
how much I must displease Your Grace.

403
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,989
No, Thomas, I respect your sincerity.

404
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,758
But respect...

405
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,033
...man, that's water in the desert.

406
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,713
How'd you like our music?

407
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,836
That air they played, it had a certain....

408
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,309
Well, tell me what you thought of it.

409
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,550
Could it have been Your Grace's own?

410
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,035
Discovered!

411
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,673
Now I'll never know your true opinion,
and that's irksome.

412
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:08,070
Well, we artists, we love praise,
yet we love truth better.

413
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,555
-Then I will tell my true opinion.
-Well?

414
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,712
To me it seemed delightful.

415
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:19,599
Thomas, I chose the right man
for chancellor.

416
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,753
I should in fairness add that my taste
in music is reputedly deplorable.

417
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,710
Your taste in music is excellent!

418
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,916
It exactly coincides with my own.

419
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,309
Music.

420
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,068
Music.

421
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:42,079
Send them back without me, Thomas.
I'll live here in Chelsea and make music.

422
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,276
My house is at Your Grace's disposal.

423
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,749
Touching this other business, mark you...

424
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,871
...I'll have no opposition.

425
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,913
Your Grace.

426
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,073
No opposition, I say. No opposition.

427
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,319
Be seated.

428
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:07,518
I'll leave you out of it
but you are my chancellor.

429
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,554
I don't take it kindly
and I'll have no opposition!

430
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,757
I see how it will be.

431
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,990
The bishops will oppose me!

432
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,837
The full-fed princes of the Church!
Hypocrites! All hypocrites!

433
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,230
Mind they do not take you in, Thomas!

434
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,873
Your Grace is unjust.

435
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,952
If I cannot serve Your Grace
in this great matter of the Queen.

436
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,315
I have no queen!

437
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,916
Catherine's not my wife!

438
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,676
No priest can make her so.

439
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,909
They that say she is my wife
are not only liars, but traitors!

440
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,319
Yes, traitors!

441
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,838
That I will not brook now!

442
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,555
Treachery!

443
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,789
I will not brook.

444
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,154
It maddens me!

445
00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:00,918
It is a deadly canker in the body politic,
and I will have it out!

446
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,429
See?

447
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,715
You see how you've maddened me?

448
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,475
I hardly know myself.

449
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,958
If you could come with me,
there's no man I'd sooner raise...

450
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,837
...yes, with my own hand.

451
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,151
Your Grace overwhelms me.

452
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,079
What's that?

453
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,152
Eight o'clock, Your Grace.

454
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,877
Lift yourself up, man.

455
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,274
Have I not promised I'll leave you out of it?

456
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,068
Shall we eat?

457
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,758
If Your Grace pleases.

458
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,399
Eight o'clock, you said.

459
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,592
The tide will be turning.

460
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,997
-I was forgetting the tide. I must go.
-I'm sorry, Your Grace.

461
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,313
If I don't catch the tide
I'll not get back to Richmond.

462
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,879
No, don't come.

463
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,835
Lady Alice, I must go and catch the tide.
Affairs call me to court.

464
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,480
So we give you our thanks
and we say goodnight!

465
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,148
What's this?

466
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,517
-You crossed him!
-Somewhat.

467
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,636
-Why?
-I couldn't find the other way.

468
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,676
You're too nice altogether, Thomas.

469
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,116
-Woman, mind your house!
-I am minding my house!

470
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,151
God save Your Majesty!

471
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,192
God save Your Grace!

472
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,752
God save the King!

473
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,668
Lift!

474
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,509
Drop blades!

475
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,110
Sire! Sire! Sire!

476
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,830
Are you coming my way, Rich?

477
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,075
No.

478
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,150
I think you should, you know.

479
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,636
I can't tell you anything.

480
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,155
Well?

481
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,514
Thomas?

482
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,598
Stay friends with him.

483
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,635
Whatever may be done by smiling,
you may rely on me to do.

484
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,670
Set your mind at rest.

485
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,077
This is not the stuff
of which martyrs are made.

486
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:11,238
Good evening, sir, Lady Alice.

487
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,477
Will wants to talk to you, Father.

488
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,751
I told him it wouldn't be convenient.

489
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:18,795
You were quite right.

490
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,358
You're very free
with my daughter's hand, Roper.

491
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:23,710
Yes.

492
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,151
It's of that I wish to speak.

493
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,318
Sir, you've had a disagreement
with His Majesty.

494
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,390
-Have l?
-So Meg tells me.

495
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,357
I offer my congratulations.

496
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,518
If it's true,
is it a matter for congratulation?

497
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:38,589
Yes!

498
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:46,311
Sir, when last I asked you
for your daughter's hand...

499
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,632
...you objected to my unorthodox opinions.

500
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,309
-I did.
-Yes.

501
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,960
Well, since then my views
have somewhat modified.

502
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,998
Well, that's good hearing, Will.

503
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:04,469
Mind you, I modify nothing concerning
the various corruptions in the Church.

504
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,279
-Quite right.
-But an attack upon the Church herself...

505
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,794
...no. I see behind that an attack on God.

506
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,313
-Roper!
-The Devil's work...

507
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,118
...to be done by the Devil's ministers!

508
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,031
For heaven's sake, remember my office.

509
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,519
If you stand on your office--

510
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:20,639
No, I don't stand on it,
but there are certain things I may not hear.

511
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:21,957
Sir Thomas.

512
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,628
Richard?

513
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,475
I fell.

514
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,434
Lady Alice.

515
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,273
-Lady Margaret.
-Good evening.

516
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:34,669
Do you know William Roper, the younger?

517
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,637
By reputation, of course.

518
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,075
-Good evening, Master....
-Rich.

519
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,713
You've heard of me?

520
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,029
Yes.

521
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:52,636
In what connection?
I don't know what you can have heard.

522
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,350
I sense that I'm not welcome here.

523
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,558
Why Richard? Have you done something
to make you not welcome?

524
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:04,959
Cromwell is asking questions.

525
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:08,316
About you. He's always asking
questions about you and your opinions.

526
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,028
Of whom?

527
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,190
Of him, for one. That's one of his sources.

528
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,075
Of course. That's one of my servants.

529
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,238
All right, Matthew.

530
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,349
Well, you look at me
as though I were an enemy.

531
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,757
Why Richard, you're shaking.

532
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,668
Help me.

533
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:36,515
How?

534
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:37,868
Employ me.

535
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:39,595
No.

536
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,838
-Employ me!
-No.

537
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,552
I would be faithful.

538
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:06,153
You couldn't answer for yourself
even so far as tonight.

539
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:18,949
Arrest him!

540
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,513
-For what?
-He's dangerous!

541
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,318
-Libel. He's a spy!
-That man's bad!

542
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,516
-There's no law against that.
-God's law!

543
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,068
-Then God can arrest him.
-While you talk, he's gone!

544
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:30,072
Go he should, if he were the Devil,
until he broke the law.

545
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,675
-Now you give the Devil benefit of law!
-Yes, what would you do?

546
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,194
Cut a road through the law
to get after the Devil?

547
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:39,113
Yes. I'd cut down every law in England
to do that.

548
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,878
And when the last law was down,
and the Devil turned on you...

549
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,872
...where would you hide, Roper,
the laws all being flat?

550
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,554
This country is planted with laws
from coast to coast...

551
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,154
...Man's laws, not God's,
and if you cut them down...

552
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,912
...and you're just the man to do it...

553
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,312
...do you really think you could stand
upright in the wind that would blow then?

554
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,036
Yes.

555
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:03,238
I give the Devil benefit of law
for my own safety's sake.

556
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,272
-Master Rich?
-Yes.

557
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:42,879
In there, sir.

558
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,636
Rich? Come in.

559
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,556
Taken you long enough to get here.

560
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,278
Have I kept you waiting?

561
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,634
Months.

562
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:05,036
-Here.
-Thank you.

563
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,879
Do you know the news?

564
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:11,192
-What news?
-Sir Thomas Paget is retiring.

565
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,671
And I succeed him.

566
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,512
Secretary to the Council?

567
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:18,669
You?

568
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,838
'Tis surprising, isn't it?

569
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,833
I mean, one sees that's logical.

570
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,473
Sit down, Rich.
No ceremony, no courtship...

571
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,591
...as His Majesty would say.

572
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,638
You see how I trust you.

573
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,199
I'd never repeat or report a thing like that.

574
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,113
What kind of thing
would you repeat or report?

575
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:47,838
Nothing said in friendship.

576
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,514
Do you believe that?

577
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,511
-Why, yes.
-No, seriously.

578
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:52,919
Well, yes.

579
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:57,028
Rich, seriously.

580
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,237
That would depend what I was offered.

581
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,598
Don't say it just to please me.

582
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:11,274
It's true. It would depend
what I was offered.

583
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,113
Well, there is another post vacant.

584
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:18,676
Collector of Revenues for York.

585
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,838
Is it in your gift?

586
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,239
Effectively.

587
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,958
What must I do for it?

588
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:30,431
I know a man
who wants to change his woman.

589
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,798
Normally a matter of small importance,
but in this case...

590
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,917
...it's our liege, Lord Henry,
the eighth of that name.

591
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:42,838
Which is a quaint way of saying that
if he wants to change his woman, he will.

592
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,990
And our job as administrators...

593
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:49,712
...is to minimise the inconvenience
which this is going to cause.

594
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:53,958
That's our only job, Rich,
to minimise the inconvenience of things.

595
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,278
A harmless occupation
you would say, but no.

596
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:00,398
We administrators are not liked, Rich.

597
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,558
We are not popular.

598
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:06,679
I say "we" on the assumption you'll accept
the post at York I've offered you.

599
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,509
Yes.

600
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:23,271
It's a bad sign when people are depressed
by their own good fortune.

601
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,316
-I'm not depressed.
-You look depressed.

602
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,709
I was lamenting. I've lost my innocence.

603
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,553
Some time ago.
Have you only just noticed?

604
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,993
Your friend, our present Lord Chancellor,
now there's an innocent man.

605
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,837
The odd thing is, he is.

606
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:42,958
Yes, I say he is. Unhappily...

607
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,315
...his innocence is tangled up
in this problem...

608
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:48,039
...that you can't change your woman
without a divorce...

609
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:51,237
...and you can't get a divorce
unless the Pope says so.

610
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:55,717
And from this meaningless circumstance,
I foresee a certain measure of....

611
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:58,235
-lnconvenience?
-Just so.

612
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,919
This goblet he gave you,
how much was it worth?

613
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:07,799
Come along, he gave you a silver goblet.
How much did you get for it?

614
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,269
Fifty shillings.

615
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:12,238
It was a gift, wasn't it,
from a litigant, a woman?

616
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,711
-Yes.
-Which court? Chancery?

617
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,391
Don't get drunk!

618
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,348
Which court was the litigant's case?

619
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,872
Court of Requests.

620
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,519
There. That wasn't too painful, was it?

621
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,393
-No.
-No.

622
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,034
And you'll find it easier, next time.

623
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,719
My Lord Archbishop, my lords...

624
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:15,355
...Reverend Doctors of the Church.

625
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:18,358
The answer of our liege, Lord Henry...

626
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,795
...to his trusty well-beloved subjects...

627
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,519
...pontiffs in the Canterbury Convocation.

628
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,388
"His Majesty...

629
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:30,308
"...acknowledges your humble admission
of many grievous errors...

630
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,839
"...for which he accepts...

631
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:37,391
"...the manumission of £100,000 in token.

632
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:43,475
"Mindful for the well-being of the realm
and the quietness of his subjects...

633
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:47,792
"...His Majesty requires that you do now
straightly renounce your pretended...

634
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:50,189
"...allegiance to the See of Rome.

635
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,757
"And admit the statute
passed through parliament...

636
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,514
"...acknowledging the King's good title...

637
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,753
"...Supreme Head of the Church
in England."

638
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:07,993
Well, my lords, what's your answer?

639
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:12,155
Yea or nay?

640
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,794
His Majesty accepts your resignation
very sadly.

641
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,435
He's mindful of your goodness
and past loyalty.

642
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:23,832
And in any matter concerning your honour
and welfare he'll continue your good lord.

643
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:27,310
You will convey my humble gratitude.

644
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,629
-Help me with this.
-Not l.

645
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,837
-Alice?
-No.

646
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:46,311
Sun and moon, Master More, you're taken
for a wise man. Is this wisdom?

647
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,238
To betray your ability...

648
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:51,835
...abandon your station
and forget your duty to your kith and kin?

649
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,112
Shall l, sir?

650
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,234
No, thank you, son Roper.

651
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,115
Margaret...

652
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:03,679
...will you?

653
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,154
Yes.

654
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,911
If you want.

655
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,637
There's my clever girl.

656
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:27,112
Well done, sir! In my opinion,
that thing's a degradation.

657
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,708
I'll tell you my opinion
of the King's title, too--

658
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:33,509
Don't! Will, silence!
Remember, you have a wife now...

659
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:36,032
...and may have children.

660
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,391
All right, Thomas, make me understand...

661
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:52,153
...because I tell you,
to me this looks like cowardice!

662
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:53,150
All right, I will.

663
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:56,830
This isn't reformation,
this is war against the Church.

664
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:00,555
Our King has declared war on the Pope
because the Pope will not declare...

665
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:03,393
-...that our Queen is not his wife.
-And is she?

666
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:07,634
Is she?

667
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:12,838
Have I your word that what we say here
is between us two?

668
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:14,069
Very well.

669
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:17,590
And if the King should command you
to repeat what I may say?

670
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,597
I should keep my word to you.

671
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:23,395
Then what has become of your oath
of obedience to the King?

672
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,752
You lay traps for me!

673
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:30,354
No, I show you the times.

674
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:37,229
We are at war with the Pope.
For the Pope's a prince, isn't he?

675
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:41,199
He is. He's also the descendant
of St. Peter, our only link with Christ.

676
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,989
So you believe.
And will you forfeit all you have...

677
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:47,913
...which includes the respect
of your country, for a belief?

678
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,151
Because what matters
is that I believe it, or rather, no...

679
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:54,757
...not that I believe it, but that I believe it.

680
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:58,751
-I trust I make myself obscure?
-Perfectly.

681
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:05,075
Why do you insult me
with this lawyer's chatter?

682
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,591
Because I'm afraid.

683
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,318
Man, you're ill.

684
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,514
This isn't Spain, you know.
This is England.

685
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:37,039
My friends, you all know
why I've called you here.

686
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:41,036
I have today resigned my office.

687
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:46,278
I am no longer a great man.

688
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,591
Sir, we want you to know
that we're all on your side.

689
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,755
My side? What side is that?

690
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:55,951
Well, sir, we all know what you think.

691
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,429
None of you knows what I think.
And if you guess...

692
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:01,432
...and babble it about,
you do me no good service.

693
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:06,869
Since I am no more a great man,
I no longer need a great household.

694
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:11,556
Nor can I afford one. You will have to go.

695
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,878
However, I still number some great men
among my friends...

696
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,155
...and they still need great households.

697
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:20,516
No one will be turned away
until we've found another place for him.

698
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:23,398
-We can't find places for them all.
-Yes, we can.

699
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:26,953
Thank you.

700
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,633
That is all.

701
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,512
What about you, Matthew?

702
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,519
Will you stay?

703
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,517
Well, sir, that's according.

704
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:51,273
There will be more work and less money.

705
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:56,439
Well then, I don't see how I can then, sir.
After all, I've got my own--

706
00:58:56,520 --> 00:59:00,308
Quite right, Matthew. Why should you?
I shall miss you, Matthew.

707
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:04,073
Oh, no, sir, you see through me, sir.
I know that.

708
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:10,198
I shall miss you.

709
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:23,515
Damn me! Isn't that them all over!

710
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,235
Miss me? What's in me for him to miss?

711
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:30,472
"Matthew, will you take a cut in wages?"
No, Sir Thomas, I will not.

712
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:35,270
And that's it. And that's all of it! All right,
so he's down on his luck, I'm sorry.

713
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:38,190
I don't mind saying
that I'm sorry, bad luck.

714
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,550
If I had good luck to spare
he could have some!

715
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,551
I wish we could have good luck
all the time.

716
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:47,077
I wish rainwater was beer!
I wish we had wings! But we don't.

717
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,035
Well, there's an end of you.

718
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,836
What'll you do now? Sit by the fire...

719
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:04,990
...and make goslings in the ash?

720
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:07,036
Not at all, Alice.

721
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:10,189
I expect I'll write a bit...

722
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:12,639
...I'll write...

723
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,550
...I'll read, I'll think.

724
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:18,872
I think I'll learn to fish.

725
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:24,348
I'll play with my grandchildren
when son Roper's done his duty.

726
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:29,316
-Alice, shall I teach you to read?
-No, by God!

727
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:35,438
Poor, silly man,
you think they'll leave you here to think?

728
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,875
If we govern our tongues, they will!

729
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:45,757
I have a word to say on that. I've made
no statement. I've resigned, that's all.

730
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:50,828
The King is made, by act of parliament,
Supreme Head of the Church in England.

731
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:55,038
This English Church will divorce him from
the Queen, then marry him to Lady Anne.

732
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:58,829
But on any of these matters,
have you heard me make a statement?

733
01:00:58,960 --> 01:00:59,949
No.

734
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:03,869
If I'm to lose my rank and fall to
housekeeping, I want to know the reason.

735
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:05,916
-So make a statement now.
-No.

736
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,878
Alice, it's a point of law.
Accept it from me...

737
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,758
...that in silence is my safety,
under the law.

738
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:15,355
And my silence must be absolute,
it must extend to you.

739
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,476
In short, you don't trust me.

740
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:24,828
I'm the Lord Chief Justice,
I'm Cromwell, I'm the keeper of the Tower.

741
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:26,479
I take your hand...

742
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:30,269
...I clamp it on the Bible,
on the blessed Cross and I say:

743
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:33,591
"Woman, has your husband
made a statement on these matters?

744
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:37,470
"On peril of your soul remember,
what is your answer?"

745
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:40,515
No.

746
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:44,393
And so it must remain.

747
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,389
Have you opened your mind to Meg?

748
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:58,513
Would I tell Meg what I won't tell you?

749
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:02,431
Meg has your heart.
I know that well enough.

750
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:15,750
This is a dangerous matter then...

751
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:18,398
...if you've not told Meg.

752
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:21,873
I don't think so. No.

753
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,196
When they find I'm silent...

754
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:28,957
...they'll want nothing better
than to leave me silent.

755
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,639
You'll see.

756
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:56,111
But he's silent, Master Secretary,
why not leave him silent?

757
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:59,192
Your Grace, not being a man of letters...

758
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:02,519
...you perhaps don't realise
the extent of his reputation.

759
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:05,433
This silence of his
is bellowing up and down Europe!

760
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:07,636
In Europe he is claimed
as the King's enemy.

761
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:10,075
Rubbish! Crank he may be,
traitor he is not.

762
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:12,469
Exactly. And with a little pressure....

763
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:15,556
With a little pressure
he can be got to say so.

764
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:18,279
That's all we need.
A brief declaration of his loyalty...

765
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:22,114
-...to the present administration.
-I still say, let sleeping dogs lie.

766
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,155
The King does not agree with you.

767
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,959
What kind of pressure do you think
you can bring to bear?

768
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:38,388
I have evidence that Sir Thomas,
while he was a judge, accepted bribes.

769
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:39,833
What?

770
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:43,874
Goddammit! He was the only judge
since Cato who didn't accept bribes!

771
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:47,111
When was there a chancellor
whose possessions, after three years...

772
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,919
...totalled £100 and a gold chain?

773
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,990
It is, as you imply, common practice...

774
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:58,992
...but a practice may be common
and remain an offence.

775
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:01,548
This offence could send a man
to the Tower.

776
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:07,748
Come here.

777
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:11,917
This woman's name is Averil Machin.
She comes from Leicester.

778
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,036
-She entered a case--
-A property case it was.

779
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:15,519
Shut your mouth.

780
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,994
A property case in the Court of Requests
in April, 1528.

781
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:20,559
And got a wicked false judgement!

782
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:23,359
And got an impeccably correct judgement
from Sir Thomas.

783
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,431
-No, sir, it was not!
-Tell the gentleman...

784
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:28,114
...about the gift you gave the judge.

785
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:30,838
I gave him a cup, sir.

786
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:34,270
A silver ltalian cup I bought in Leicester,
for 100 shillings.

787
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:36,271
Did Sir Thomas accept this cup?

788
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:37,669
Yes, sir, he did.

789
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:41,070
He did accept it. We can corroborate that.
You can go.

790
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:43,231
-To my way of thinking--
-Go!

791
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:54,360
-ls that your witness?
-No.

792
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:59,671
By an odd coincidence that cup later
came into the hands of Master Rich here.

793
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:02,469
How?

794
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:08,238
-He gave it to me, Your Grace.
-Gave it to you? Why?

795
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:09,834
A gift.

796
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:13,792
Yes, you were a friend, weren't you?

797
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,550
When did Thomas give you this thing?

798
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:19,157
I can't exactly remember.

799
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:24,189
Do you "remember" what you did with it?

800
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,318
-I sold it.
-Where?

801
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:29,076
-A shop.
-Has the shop still got it?

802
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:32,190
No. They've lost all track of it.

803
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:33,839
How convenient.

804
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:37,916
You doubt Master Rich's word,
Your Grace?

805
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,230
It had occurred to me.

806
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:45,151
This is the bill of sale.

807
01:05:55,520 --> 01:06:00,116
That cow put her case into court in April,
you said. This is dated May.

808
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:04,033
In other words, the moment Thomas knew
the cup was a bribe...

809
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:07,396
...he dropped it into the nearest gutter.

810
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:13,038
The facts will bear that interpretation,
I suppose.

811
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,879
This is a horse that won't run,
Master Secretary.

812
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:19,633
Just a trial gallop.
We'll find something better.

813
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:22,188
-I want no part of it.
-You have no choice.

814
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,672
What's that you say?

815
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:31,312
The King particularly wishes you
to be active in this matter of Sir Thomas.

816
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:33,239
He's not told me that.

817
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:35,151
Indeed? He told me.

818
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,678
Look here, Cromwell...

819
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:43,030
...what's the purpose of all this?

820
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:44,639
There you have me.

821
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:48,110
It's a matter of conscience, I think.

822
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:51,676
The King wants Sir Thomas
to bless his marriage.

823
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:56,432
If Sir Thomas appeared at the wedding
now, it might save us all a lot of trouble.

824
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:01,189
He won't attend the wedding.

825
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:03,709
If I were you, I'd try and persuade him.

826
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:07,357
I really would try, if I were you.

827
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:12,638
Cromwell, are you threatening me?

828
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:15,957
My dear Norfolk, this isn't Spain.

829
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,392
This is England!

830
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:31,589
Thomas? Thomas!

831
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:35,909
Lady Margaret?

832
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:36,830
Yes.

833
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:42,396
We've been cutting greens.
We use them for fuel.

834
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:48,712
I have a letter for your father,
Lady Margaret. From Hampton Court.

835
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,959
He's to answer certain charges
before Secretary Cromwell.

836
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,797
Good of you to come, Sir Thomas.

837
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,994
Master Rich will make a record
of our conversation.

838
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:11,036
Good of you to tell me, Master Secretary.

839
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:12,553
I think you know one another.

840
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,870
Indeed yes, we're old friends.

841
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:18,030
That's a nice gown you have, Richard.

842
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,150
Sir Thomas, believe me.

843
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:29,273
No, that's asking too much.
But let me tell you all the same.

844
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:33,189
You have no more sincere admirer
than myself.

845
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:36,555
No, not yet, Rich, not yet.

846
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,152
If I might hear the charges.

847
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:45,073
-The charges?
-I understand there are certain charges.

848
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:48,630
Some ambiguities of behaviour
I should like to clarify, hardly charges.

849
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:52,235
Make a note of that, will you, Master Rich?
There are no charges.

850
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:55,350
Sir Thomas, Sir Thomas.

851
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:03,072
The King is not pleased with you.

852
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:05,273
I am grieved.

853
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:09,396
And yet, do you know that even now,
if you could bring yourself...

854
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:12,950
...to agree with the Church,
universities, the Lords and the Commons...

855
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:16,669
...there is no honour which His Majesty
would be likely to deny you?

856
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:20,351
I am well acquainted with
His Grace's generosity.

857
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:24,389
Very well.

858
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:30,833
You have heard of the so-called
"Holy Maid of Kent"...

859
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:33,629
...who was executed for prophesying
against the King?

860
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:35,790
-Yes, I met her.
-Yes, you met her.

861
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:39,430
Yet you did not warn His Majesty
of her treason. How was that?

862
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:42,751
She spoke no treason.
Our talk was not political.

863
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:45,998
But the woman was notorious.
Do you expect me to believe that?

864
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:49,152
-Happily, there were witnesses.
-You wrote a letter to her.

865
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:53,950
Yes. I wrote, advising her to abstain
from meddling in the affairs of state.

866
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:57,794
I have a copy of the letter. Also witnessed.

867
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:04,749
-You have been cautious.
-I like to keep my affairs regular.

868
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:15,314
In the June of 1521,
the King published a book.

869
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:17,713
A theological work.

870
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:21,754
It was called,
A Defence of the Seven Sacraments.

871
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:26,595
For which he was named "Defender
of the Faith" by His Holiness, the Pope.

872
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:29,911
By the Bishop of Rome,
or do you insist on "pope"?

873
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,993
No. "Bishop of Rome" if you like.
It doesn't alter his authority.

874
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:40,200
Thank you. You come to the point
very readily. What is that authority?

875
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:42,271
For example, in the Church of England...

876
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:45,079
...what exactly is
the Bishop of Rome's authority?

877
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:50,112
You will find it very ably set out
and defended, Master Secretary...

878
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:52,078
...in the King's book.

879
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:55,837
In the book published under
the King's name, would be more accurate.

880
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:58,309
-You wrote this book.
-I wrote no part of it.

881
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,197
I don't mean you actually held the pen.

882
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:02,999
I answered to my best ability,
some points of common law...

883
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:05,310
...which the King put to me,
as I was bound to do.

884
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:06,913
Do you deny you instigated it?

885
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,436
It was from first to last
the King's own project.

886
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:11,589
The King says not.

887
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:17,150
The King knows the truth of it.

888
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,195
And whatever he may have said to you...

889
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:23,352
...he will not give evidence
to support this accusation.

890
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:25,948
Why not?

891
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:30,158
Because evidence is given on oath,
and he will not perjure himself.

892
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:34,315
If you don't know that,
then you don't yet know him.

893
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:41,079
Sir Thomas More.

894
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:42,389
Have you anything to say...

895
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:44,755
...regarding the King's marriage
with Queen Anne?

896
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:47,870
I understood
I was not to be asked that again.

897
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:49,996
Then you understood wrongly.
These charges--

898
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:54,358
They are terrors for children,
Master Secretary, not for me!

899
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:02,479
Then know that the King
commands me to charge you...

900
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:05,028
...in his name, with great ingratitude!

901
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:09,713
And to tell you that there never was,
nor could be, so villainous a servant...

902
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:12,553
...nor so traitorous a subject, as yourself!

903
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:15,309
So...

904
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:20,115
...I am brought here at last.

905
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:22,029
Brought?

906
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:25,840
You've brought yourself
to where you stand now.

907
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,115
You may go.

908
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:35,759
For the present.

909
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:43,478
What will you do now?

910
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,397
Whatever's necessary.

911
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:56,989
Boat!

912
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:16,078
Oh, come, come, it's not as bad as all that!

913
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:22,514
Howard!

914
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:29,833
I can't get home.

915
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:32,312
They won't bring me a boat.

916
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:34,272
Do you blame them?

917
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:35,998
Is it as bad as that?

918
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:38,670
It's every bit as bad as that!

919
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:42,154
Then it's good of you to be seen with me.

920
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:43,753
I followed you.

921
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:46,512
Were you followed?

922
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,756
-You're dangerous to know!
-Then don't know me.

923
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:00,717
-I do know you.
-I mean as a friend.

924
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:04,679
-I am your friend. I wish I wasn't, but I am.
-What's to be done then?

925
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:06,791
-Give in.
-I can't give in, Howard.

926
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:09,075
Our friendship's more mutable than that.

927
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:11,799
The one fixed point in the world
of turning friendship...

928
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:15,475
-...is that Sir More won't give in.
-To me it has to be, for that's myself.

929
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:18,074
Affection goes as deep in me
as you, I think.

930
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:22,798
But only God is love right through,
Howard, and that's my self.

931
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:25,639
And who are you?

932
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:29,311
A lawyer! And a lawyer's son!

933
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:33,279
We're supposed to be the proud ones,
the arrogant ones, we've all given in.

934
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:34,952
Why must you stand out?

935
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:38,271
Goddammit man! It's disproportionate!

936
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:42,873
You'll break my heart.

937
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:47,749
No one is safe, Howard,
and you have a son.

938
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:53,155
We'll end our friendship now.

939
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:55,596
-For friendship's sake?
-Yes.

940
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:57,236
Daft!

941
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:06,511
Norfolk, you're a fool!

942
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:10,235
You can't place a quarrel,
you haven't the style.

943
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:13,790
Hear me out. You and your class
have given in, as you rightly call it...

944
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:16,758
...'cause this country's religion
means nothing to you at all.

945
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:18,990
Well, that's a foolish saying for a start!

946
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:21,399
The nobility of England--

947
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:25,439
The nobility of England would have
snored through the Sermon on the Mount!

948
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:29,149
But you'll labour like scholars
over a bulldog's pedigree.

949
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:31,437
An artificial quarrel is not a quarrel.

950
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:35,069
We've had a quarrel since the day we met.
Our friendship was mere sloth.

951
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:38,079
You can be cruel when you want,
but I've always known that.

952
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:41,232
What do you value in your bulldogs?
Gripping, is it not?

953
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:44,354
-Yes.
-It's their nature?

954
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:46,158
-Yes.
-It's why you breed them?

955
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:47,389
It's so with men.

956
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:49,711
I will not give in, because I oppose it.

957
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:55,158
Not my pride, not my spleen,
nor any other of my appetites, but I do, l.

958
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,913
Is there, in the midst of all this muscle,
no sinew that serves no appetite...

959
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,230
...of Norfolk's, but is just Norfolk?
There is!

960
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:04,197
-Give that some exercise, my lord!
-Thomas!

961
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:07,192
As you stand you'll go before your Maker
ill conditioned!

962
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:07,951
Now steady.

963
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:12,750
And he'll think that, somewhere back along
your pedigree, a bitch got over the wall!

964
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:30,439
Cast in this very house
on April 3, last year...

965
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:34,998
...it is a matter very fit
for the Commons, gathered here...

966
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:37,548
...in parliament, to take in hand.

967
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:41,793
Or, in consequence of the decay of guilds...

968
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:46,039
...the woolen cloth, now coming out
of Yorkshire, Lincoln...

969
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:49,476
...and the like, is not to blame and this....

970
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:54,557
I will defer the rest of my matter to later.

971
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:05,992
That the loyal Commons, here assembled,
will speedily enact this bill, I doubt not.

972
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:10,472
For as much as it concerns the King's
new title and his marriage to Queen Anne.

973
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:14,355
Both matters pleasing to a loyal subject.

974
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:17,592
Mark, my Masters...

975
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:22,232
...there is among us
a brood of discreet traitors...

976
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,830
...to which deceit
the King can brook no longer.

977
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:30,711
And we, his loyal huntsmen, must now
drive these subtle foxes from their covert.

978
01:20:58,400 --> 01:20:59,150
Father?

979
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:00,275
Margaret!

980
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:03,438
I couldn't get a boat.

981
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:05,518
What is it, Meg?

982
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:08,160
Father, there's a new act
going through parliament.

983
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:12,669
And by this act,
they're going to administer an oath...

984
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:14,478
...about the marriage.

985
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,792
On what compulsion is the oath?

986
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,230
-High treason.
-But what is the wording?

987
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:22,595
Do the words matter?
We know what it means.

988
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:23,749
Tell me the words.

989
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:26,434
An oath is made of words.
It may be possible to take it.

990
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:27,111
Take it?

991
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:29,516
And if it can be taken,
you must take it, too.

992
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:31,197
No!

993
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:35,512
Listen, Meg. God made the angels
to show him splendour.

994
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:40,516
As he made animals for innocence
and plants for their simplicity.

995
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:45,270
But Man he made to serve him wittily,
in the tangle of his mind.

996
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:48,917
If he suffers us to come to such a case
that there is no escaping...

997
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,719
...then we may stand to our tackle
as best we can.

998
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:56,635
And yes, Meg, then we can clamour
like champions, if we have the spittle for it.

999
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:00,748
But it's God's part, not our own,
to bring ourselves to such a pass.

1000
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:04,071
Our natural business lies in escaping.

1001
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:08,111
If I can take this oath, I will.

1002
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,752
I would, for my sake,
you could take the oath.

1003
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:17,308
I never took a man into the Tower
less willingly.

1004
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:19,472
Thank you, Master Governor.

1005
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:23,679
Thank you.

1006
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:26,995
Sir Thomas.

1007
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:57,949
Sir Thomas.

1008
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,194
Sir Thomas!

1009
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:23,951
This is iniquitous.

1010
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:29,835
-Where to this time?
-Richmond Palace.

1011
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:25,914
Sit down.

1012
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:36,312
This is the Seventh Commission
to inquire into the case...

1013
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:39,278
...of Sir Thomas More, appointed
by His Majesty's Council.

1014
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:41,237
Have you anything to say?

1015
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:42,355
No.

1016
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:46,957
-Seen this document before?
-Many times.

1017
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:48,598
It is the Act of Succession.

1018
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:51,069
These are the names
of those who have sworn to it.

1019
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:54,038
-I have, as you say, seen it before.
-Will you swear to it?

1020
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:55,155
No.

1021
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:57,837
Thomas, we must know--

1022
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:05,713
We must know plainly whether you
recognise the offspring of Queen Anne...

1023
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:07,711
...as heirs to the throne.

1024
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:10,314
The King in parliament
tells me that they are.

1025
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:12,834
-Of course I recognise them.
-Will you swear to it?

1026
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:15,798
-Yes.
-Then why won't he swear to the act?

1027
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:18,599
Because there is more than that in the act.

1028
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:23,037
Just so. Sir Thomas, it states in the
preamble that the King's former marriage...

1029
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:25,031
...to the Lady Catherine was unlawful...

1030
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:29,636
...she being his brother's widow and
the Pope having no authority to sanction it.

1031
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:32,671
Is that what you deny?

1032
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:40,391
Is that what you dispute?

1033
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:49,438
Is that what you are not sure of?

1034
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:59,678
You insult His Majesty and Council
in the person of the Lord Archbishop!

1035
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:00,954
I insult no one.

1036
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:04,749
I will not take the oath.
I will not tell you why I will not.

1037
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:08,270
-Then your reasons must be treasonable!
-Not "must be," may be.

1038
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:09,998
It's a fair assumption!

1039
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:13,789
The law requires more than an assumption,
the law requires a fact.

1040
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:16,952
Of course, I cannot judge
your legal standing in the case...

1041
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:19,759
...but until I know the ground
of your objections...

1042
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:23,674
...I can only guess
your spiritual standing, too.

1043
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:27,828
If you're willing to guess that, it should be
small matter to guess my objections.

1044
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:29,831
Then you do have objections to the act?

1045
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:31,672
Well, we know that, Cromwell!

1046
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:33,199
No, my lord, you don't.

1047
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:37,068
You may suppose I have objections,
all you know is that I will not swear to it...

1048
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:40,072
...for which you cannot lawfully
harm me further.

1049
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:44,677
But if you were right in supposing me
to have objections, and right again...

1050
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:47,194
...in supposing my objections
to be treasonable...

1051
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:50,477
...the law would let you cut my head off.

1052
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:53,478
Oh, yes.

1053
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:56,158
Well done, Sir Thomas.

1054
01:27:56,240 --> 01:28:00,074
I've been trying to make that clear
to His Grace for some time.

1055
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:02,355
Oh, confound all this! I'm not a scholar.

1056
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:04,510
I don't know if the marriage
was lawful or not...

1057
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:06,591
...but damn it, Thomas,
look at these names.

1058
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:10,390
Why can't you do as I did,
and come with us, for fellowship?

1059
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:15,395
And when we die, and you are sent
to heaven for doing your conscience...

1060
01:28:15,480 --> 01:28:20,315
...and I am sent to hell for not doing mine,
will you come with me, for fellowship?

1061
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:24,711
So, those of us whose names are there,
are damned, Sir Thomas?

1062
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:27,678
I have no window to look into
another man's conscience.

1063
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:28,988
I condemn no one.

1064
01:28:29,080 --> 01:28:31,548
-Then the matter is capable of question?
-Certainly.

1065
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:34,757
But that you owe obedience to the King
is not capable of question.

1066
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:37,912
So weigh a doubt against a certainty
and sign.

1067
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:45,595
Some men think the earth is round,
others think it flat.

1068
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:48,234
It is a matter capable of question.

1069
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:53,118
But if it is flat,
will the King's command make it round?

1070
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:56,397
And if it is round,
will the King's command flatten it?

1071
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:59,953
No, I will not sign.

1072
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:03,636
Then you have more regard for
your own doubt than the King's command?

1073
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:05,915
-For myself I have no doubt.
-No doubt of what?

1074
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,195
No doubt that I will not take this oath.

1075
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:12,398
But why I will not, you,
Master Secretary, will not trick out of me.

1076
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:15,553
I might get it out of you in other ways.

1077
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:19,228
You threaten like a dockside bully.

1078
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:20,594
How should I threaten?

1079
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:24,355
Like a minister of state, with justice!

1080
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:27,554
Justice is what you're threatened with.

1081
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:29,477
Then I am not threatened.

1082
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:37,795
Gentlemen, can't I go to bed?

1083
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,355
Aye. The prisoner may retire
as he requests.

1084
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:43,477
-Unless you--
-I see no purpose in prolonging this.

1085
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:50,312
Then, goodnight, Thomas.

1086
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:57,669
May I have one or two more books?

1087
01:29:58,520 --> 01:29:59,953
Why, you have books?

1088
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:01,230
Yes.

1089
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:03,754
I didn't know, you shouldn't have.

1090
01:30:11,680 --> 01:30:13,432
May I see my family?

1091
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:14,555
No.

1092
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:21,749
Captain!

1093
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:23,678
Master Secretary?

1094
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:27,950
Have you ever heard the prisoner speak
of the King's divorce, supremacy...

1095
01:30:28,040 --> 01:30:30,235
-...or the King's marriage?
-No, not a word.

1096
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:32,914
If he does, you will repeat it to me.

1097
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:35,199
Of course.

1098
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:40,950
Rich.

1099
01:30:41,080 --> 01:30:41,910
Secretary?

1100
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,594
Tomorrow morning,
remove the prisoner's books.

1101
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:46,398
Is that necessary?

1102
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:49,392
With regards to this case,
the King is becoming impatient.

1103
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:51,277
-Aye, with you.
-With all of us.

1104
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:54,511
The King's impatience
will embrace a duke or two.

1105
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:05,319
Master Secretary.

1106
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:09,270
Sir Redvers Llewellyn has retired.

1107
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:12,196
The Attorney General for Wales.

1108
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:14,158
His post is vacant.

1109
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:17,356
You said that I might approach you.

1110
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:20,357
Not now, Rich.

1111
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:25,436
He must submit. He must!

1112
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:27,549
Rack him.

1113
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:34,949
No. The King's conscience
will not permit it.

1114
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:37,595
We have to find some other way.

1115
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:47,873
Sir Thomas!

1116
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:50,996
Father!

1117
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:52,399
What? Margaret?

1118
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:54,673
Father!

1119
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:58,397
Meg. For God's sake,
they haven't put you in here?

1120
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:00,789
-No, sir, a visit.
-A brief one, Sir Thomas.

1121
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:02,233
Father.

1122
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:05,470
-Good morning, husband.
-Good morning.

1123
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:10,638
Good morning, Will.

1124
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:18,030
Well, this is a hellish place!

1125
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:21,192
Except it's keeping me from you,
my dears, it isn't so bad.

1126
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:22,952
It's remarkably like any other place.

1127
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:25,838
-lt drips!
-Yes. It's too near the river.

1128
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:38,309
Well, what is it?

1129
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:44,070
Father, come out!
Swear to the act and come out!

1130
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:48,270
Is this why they've let you come?

1131
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:49,389
Yes.

1132
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,150
Meg's under oath to persuade you.

1133
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:57,512
That was silly, Meg.

1134
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:07,590
How do you plan to do that?

1135
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:10,709
Father.

1136
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:14,710
"God more regards the thoughts
of the heart than the words of the mouth."

1137
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:17,075
-Well, so you've always told me.
-Yes.

1138
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:20,197
Then say the words of the oath
and in your heart think otherwise.

1139
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:23,397
What is an oath then,
but words we say to God?

1140
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:31,028
Listen, Meg.

1141
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:35,713
When a man takes an oath, he's holding
his own self in his own hands...

1142
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,228
...Iike water.

1143
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:42,275
And if he opens his fingers then,
he needn't hope to find himself again.

1144
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:48,150
Some men aren't capable of this, but I'd be
loathed to think your father one of them.

1145
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:53,435
-I have another argument.
-Oh, Meg.

1146
01:33:53,720 --> 01:33:58,669
In any state that was half good,
you would be raised up high, not here...

1147
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:01,718
-...for what you've done already.
-All right.

1148
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:04,554
It's not your fault
the state's three-quarters bad.

1149
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:05,356
No.

1150
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:07,954
If you elect to suffer for it,
you elect to be a hero.

1151
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:09,519
That's very neat.

1152
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:14,152
But look now. If we lived in a state
where virtue was profitable...

1153
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:16,675
...common sense would make us saintly.

1154
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:20,992
But since we see that avarice, anger,
pride and stupidity...

1155
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:26,030
...commonly profit far beyond charity,
modesty, justice and thought...

1156
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:28,668
...perhaps we must stand fast a little...

1157
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:31,229
...even at the risk of being heroes.

1158
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:37,073
But in reason!

1159
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:40,470
Haven't you done as much
as God can reasonably want?

1160
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:48,794
Well, finally it isn't a matter of reason.

1161
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:51,195
Finally, it's a matter of love.

1162
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:57,312
You're content then to be shut up here
with mice and rats...

1163
01:34:57,400 --> 01:34:59,595
-...when you might be home with us?
-Content?

1164
01:34:59,680 --> 01:35:04,674
If they'd open a crack that wide, I'd be
through it like a bird and back to Chelsea.

1165
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:11,714
I haven't told you
what the house is like without you.

1166
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:12,915
Don't, Meg.

1167
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:16,117
-What we do in the evening without you.
-Meg, have done.

1168
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:18,350
We don't read because we've no candles.

1169
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:21,313
We don't talk because we wonder
what they're doing to you.

1170
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:23,994
The King is more merciful.
He doesn't use the rack.

1171
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:25,752
Two minutes to go, sir.

1172
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:28,400
-I thought you'd like to know.
-Two minutes!

1173
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,434
-Jailer!
-Sorry, sir. Two minutes.

1174
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:36,914
Listen, you must leave the country.
All of you must leave the country.

1175
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:38,911
-And leave you?
-lt makes no difference.

1176
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,718
They won't let me see you again.

1177
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:43,598
You must all go on the same day,
but not on the same boat.

1178
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:46,877
-Different boats from different ports.
-After the trial, then.

1179
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:49,428
There'll be no trial, they have no case.

1180
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:52,871
Do this for me, I beseech you.

1181
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:54,752
-Will?
-Yes, sir.

1182
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:56,592
-Margaret?
-Yes.

1183
01:35:57,240 --> 01:35:58,229
Alice?

1184
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:06,599
-Alice, I command you!
-Right.

1185
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:15,591
This is splendid.

1186
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:19,033
-I know who packed this.
-I packed it.

1187
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:20,109
Yes.

1188
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:25,228
You still make a superlative custard, Alice.

1189
01:36:25,320 --> 01:36:26,355
Do l?

1190
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:31,030
That's a nice dress you have on.

1191
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:33,992
Nice colour anyway.

1192
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:36,316
My God, you think little of me!

1193
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:37,790
I know I'm a fool...

1194
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:40,997
...but I'm not such a fool
as to be lamenting for my dresses...

1195
01:36:41,080 --> 01:36:43,435
...or to relish complimenting
on my custards.

1196
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:45,238
I'm well rebuked.

1197
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:48,118
-Alice--
-No!

1198
01:36:51,160 --> 01:36:55,756
I'm sick with fear when I think of the worst
they may do to me.

1199
01:36:55,920 --> 01:37:00,835
But worse than that will be to go
with you not understanding why I go.

1200
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:01,909
I don't.

1201
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:06,949
If you can tell me that you understand,
I might make a good death, if I have to.

1202
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:11,079
-Your death's no good to me.
-You must tell me that you understand.

1203
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:12,275
I don't!

1204
01:37:12,640 --> 01:37:14,358
I don't believe this had to happen!

1205
01:37:14,440 --> 01:37:16,590
If you say that
I don't see how I'm to face it.

1206
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:17,954
It's the truth!

1207
01:37:18,360 --> 01:37:21,397
-You're an honest woman.
-Much good may it do me.

1208
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:24,276
I'll tell you what I'm afraid of...

1209
01:37:24,360 --> 01:37:27,158
...that when you've gone,
I shall hate you for it.

1210
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:33,038
You mustn't, Alice.

1211
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:37,628
You mustn't.

1212
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:46,312
As for understanding, I understand you're
the best man I ever met or ever likely to.

1213
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:51,515
And if you go, God knows why I suppose,
though as God's my witness...

1214
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:53,750
...God's kept deadly quiet about it.

1215
01:37:54,440 --> 01:37:58,319
And if any one wants to know
my opinion of the King and his Council...

1216
01:37:58,440 --> 01:38:01,000
...he only has to ask for it!

1217
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:07,637
Why, it's a lion I married.

1218
01:38:07,880 --> 01:38:09,598
A lion. A lion.

1219
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:17,430
This is good.

1220
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:21,359
It's very good.

1221
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:23,758
Sorry, Sir Thomas!

1222
01:38:24,200 --> 01:38:26,270
-Oh, for pity's sake!
-Time's up, sir.

1223
01:38:26,360 --> 01:38:29,079
-But one more minute!
-You don't know what you're asking.

1224
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:30,957
-Come along, Miss.
-For heaven's sake.

1225
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:32,712
Now, don't do that, sir.

1226
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:37,750
Now, madam, don't make trouble.

1227
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:42,790
Come along, please, Lady Alice.

1228
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:48,750
Take your muddy paws off me!

1229
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:52,238
Filthy, stinking, gutter-fed, turnkey!

1230
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:55,155
I'll see you suffer for this!

1231
01:38:56,360 --> 01:38:57,554
Goodbye.

1232
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:14,355
You must understand my position, sir.

1233
01:39:14,680 --> 01:39:18,150
I'm a plain, simple man
and I just want to keep out of trouble.

1234
01:39:27,640 --> 01:39:32,077
Dear Lord Jesus, my soul Saviour,
clear my wits.

1235
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:37,478
Dear Lady, Blessed Mother of God,
comfort my wife and daughter...

1236
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:40,356
...and forgive me for them.

1237
01:40:42,200 --> 01:40:46,478
Sir Thomas More, though you have
heinously offended the King's majesty...

1238
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:51,509
...we hope that if you'll even now
forethink and repent of obstinate opinion...

1239
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:54,593
...you may still taste his gracious pardon.

1240
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:57,717
My lords, I thank you.

1241
01:40:58,440 --> 01:41:00,829
As for the matters
you may charge me with...

1242
01:41:00,920 --> 01:41:04,549
...I fear from my present weakness,
that neither my wit...

1243
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:06,790
...nor my memory will serve...

1244
01:41:07,400 --> 01:41:09,311
...to make sufficient answer.

1245
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:12,755
I should be glad to sit down.

1246
01:41:12,920 --> 01:41:14,592
A chair for the prisoner.

1247
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:30,630
Master Secretary Cromwell,
have you the charge?

1248
01:41:30,720 --> 01:41:33,029
-I have, my lord.
-Then read the charge.

1249
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:39,751
"That you did wilfully and maliciously
deny and deprive...

1250
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:43,515
"...our liege, Lord Henry,
of his undoubted certain title...

1251
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:46,558
"...Supreme Head of the Church
in England."

1252
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:51,151
But, I have never denied this title.

1253
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:57,115
At Westminster Hall, at Lambeth,
and again at Richmond...

1254
01:41:57,240 --> 01:41:59,629
...you stubbornly refused the oath.

1255
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:01,074
Was this no denial?

1256
01:42:01,160 --> 01:42:03,151
No, this was silence.

1257
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:06,677
And for my silence,
I am punished with imprisonment.

1258
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:11,959
-Why have I been called again?
-On a charge of high treason, Sir Thomas.

1259
01:42:12,720 --> 01:42:15,632
For which the punishment
is not imprisonment.

1260
01:42:16,040 --> 01:42:17,075
Death...

1261
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,875
...comes for us all, my lords.

1262
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:22,276
Yes, even for kings he comes.

1263
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:25,318
The death of kings is not in question,
Sir Thomas.

1264
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:28,472
Nor mine, I trust, until I'm proven guilty.

1265
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:31,876
Your life lies in your own hands, Thomas,
as it always has!

1266
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:33,712
Is that so, my lord?

1267
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:35,992
Then I'll keep a good grip on it.

1268
01:42:42,680 --> 01:42:44,193
So, Sir Thomas...

1269
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:46,716
...you stand on your silence?

1270
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:48,475
I do.

1271
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:51,191
But, gentlemen of the jury...

1272
01:42:51,960 --> 01:42:54,633
...there are many kinds of silence.

1273
01:42:55,080 --> 01:42:58,072
Consider first the silence of a man
when he is dead.

1274
01:42:58,400 --> 01:43:01,437
Suppose we go into the room
where he is laid out and we listen.

1275
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:02,635
What do we hear?

1276
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:05,308
Silence.

1277
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:08,752
What does it betoken, this silence?

1278
01:43:09,320 --> 01:43:11,880
Nothing. This is silence pure and simple.

1279
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:13,918
But let us take another case.

1280
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,753
Suppose I were to take a dagger
from my sleeve...

1281
01:43:16,840 --> 01:43:18,751
...and make to kill the prisoner with it.

1282
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:22,992
And my lordships there, instead of crying
out for me to stop, maintain their silence.

1283
01:43:23,080 --> 01:43:24,911
That would betoken!

1284
01:43:25,200 --> 01:43:28,397
It would betoken a willingness
that I should do it.

1285
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:31,398
And under the law,
they would be guilty with me.

1286
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:35,869
So silence can,
according to the circumstances...

1287
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:37,829
...speak.

1288
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:42,678
Let us consider now the circumstances
of the prisoner's silence.

1289
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:46,909
The oath was put to loyal subjects
all over the country who all declared...

1290
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,070
...His Grace's title to be just and good!

1291
01:43:49,160 --> 01:43:52,118
But when it came to the prisoner,
he refused!

1292
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:56,190
He calls this "silence."

1293
01:43:57,320 --> 01:43:59,959
Yet, is there a man in this court....

1294
01:44:00,720 --> 01:44:03,553
Is there a man in this country...

1295
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:07,913
...who does not know
Sir Thomas More's opinion of this title?

1296
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:12,232
Yet, how can this be?

1297
01:44:12,600 --> 01:44:15,433
Because this silence betokened...

1298
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:20,630
...nay, this silence was not silence at all,
but most eloquent denial!

1299
01:44:23,080 --> 01:44:24,274
Not so.

1300
01:44:26,120 --> 01:44:27,792
Not so, Master Secretary.

1301
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:33,677
The maxim of the law is,
"Silence gives consent."

1302
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:36,752
If, therefore, you wish to construe
what my silence betokened...

1303
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:40,879
...you must construe that I consented,
not that I denied.

1304
01:44:42,120 --> 01:44:44,839
Is that in fact what the world
construes from it?

1305
01:44:44,920 --> 01:44:48,071
Do you pretend that is what you wish
the world to construe from it?

1306
01:44:48,160 --> 01:44:51,311
The world must construe
according to its wits.

1307
01:44:51,480 --> 01:44:54,597
This court must construe
according to the law.

1308
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:06,593
My lords, I wish to call Sir Richard Rich!

1309
01:45:08,200 --> 01:45:10,839
Richard Rich, come into court.

1310
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:12,712
Richard Rich!

1311
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:36,709
"l do swear the evidence I'll give
before the court shall be the truth...

1312
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:39,075
"...the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth."

1313
01:45:39,160 --> 01:45:40,798
"So help me God," sir.

1314
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:42,553
"So help me God."

1315
01:45:45,240 --> 01:45:48,835
Now Rich, on May 12,
you were at the Tower?

1316
01:45:49,120 --> 01:45:50,758
-I was.
-For what purpose?

1317
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:53,035
I was sent to carry away
the prisoner's books.

1318
01:45:53,120 --> 01:45:55,270
-Did you talk with the prisoner?
-Yes.

1319
01:45:55,360 --> 01:45:57,999
Did you talk of the King's supremacy
of the Church?

1320
01:45:58,080 --> 01:45:59,069
Yes.

1321
01:45:59,360 --> 01:46:00,918
What did you say?

1322
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:04,518
I said to him, "Supposing there were
an act of parliament...

1323
01:46:04,600 --> 01:46:07,160
"...to say that l, Richard Rich,
were to be king.

1324
01:46:07,240 --> 01:46:10,038
"Would not you, Master More,
take me for king?"

1325
01:46:10,240 --> 01:46:11,639
"That I would," he said.

1326
01:46:15,240 --> 01:46:17,435
"For then you would be king."

1327
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:20,749
Yes?

1328
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:25,356
Then he said,
"But I will put you a higher case.

1329
01:46:26,040 --> 01:46:30,830
"How, if there were an act of parliament,
to say that God should not be God?"

1330
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:33,794
-This is true and then you said--
-Silence!

1331
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:35,549
Continue.

1332
01:46:38,120 --> 01:46:41,829
But then I said,
"l will put you a middle case.

1333
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:44,880
"Parliament has made our King
Head of the Church.

1334
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:46,871
"Why will you not accept him?"

1335
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:51,195
Well?

1336
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:58,109
And then he said,
"Parliament had not the power to do it."

1337
01:46:59,800 --> 01:47:01,950
Repeat the prisoner's words.

1338
01:47:03,680 --> 01:47:04,715
He said:

1339
01:47:06,080 --> 01:47:08,469
"Parliament had not the competence."

1340
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:12,757
Or words to that effect.

1341
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:15,110
He denied the title!

1342
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:16,714
He did.

1343
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:29,310
In good faith, Rich,
I am sorrier for your perjury than my peril.

1344
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:31,954
-Do you deny this?
-Yes!

1345
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:35,637
You know if I were a man
who heeded not the taking of an oath...

1346
01:47:35,720 --> 01:47:37,119
...I need not be here.

1347
01:47:37,680 --> 01:47:40,069
Now, I will take an oath.

1348
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:44,593
If what Master Rich has said is true...

1349
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:48,788
...I pray I may never see God in the face.

1350
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:53,349
Which I would not say, were it otherwise,
for anything on earth!

1351
01:47:53,480 --> 01:47:56,074
-That is not evidence.
-ls it probable....

1352
01:47:56,840 --> 01:48:01,231
Is it probable
that after so long a silence on this...

1353
01:48:01,320 --> 01:48:03,788
...the very point so urgently sought of me...

1354
01:48:03,880 --> 01:48:07,509
...I should open my mind
to such a man as that?

1355
01:48:09,040 --> 01:48:12,271
Sir Richard, do you wish
to modify your testimony?

1356
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:14,429
No, my lord.

1357
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:17,034
Is there anything you wish
to take away from it?

1358
01:48:17,120 --> 01:48:18,189
No, my lord.

1359
01:48:18,280 --> 01:48:20,077
Have you anything to add?

1360
01:48:20,360 --> 01:48:21,588
No, my lord.

1361
01:48:22,840 --> 01:48:25,957
-Have you, Sir Thomas?
-To what purpose?

1362
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:31,352
I am a dead man.

1363
01:48:34,920 --> 01:48:36,751
You have your will of me.

1364
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:40,070
Then the witness may withdraw.

1365
01:48:47,120 --> 01:48:50,192
There is one question
I would like to ask the witness.

1366
01:48:52,640 --> 01:48:55,712
That's a chain of office you're wearing.
May I see it?

1367
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:04,759
The Red Dragon.

1368
01:49:05,080 --> 01:49:06,229
What's this?

1369
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:09,312
Sir Richard is appointed
Attorney General for Wales.

1370
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:10,794
For Wales.

1371
01:49:12,280 --> 01:49:17,229
Why Richard, it profits a man nothing
to give his soul for the whole world.

1372
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:20,473
But for Wales.

1373
01:49:28,520 --> 01:49:29,953
My lords! I've done.

1374
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,514
The jury will retire
and consider the evidence.

1375
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:39,911
Considering the evidence, it shouldn't
be necessary for them to retire.

1376
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:43,912
Is it necessary?

1377
01:49:50,440 --> 01:49:53,079
Then is the prisoner guilty or not guilty?

1378
01:49:58,040 --> 01:49:59,632
Guilty, my lord!

1379
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:13,349
Sir Thomas More,
you have been found guilty of high treason.

1380
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:15,835
-The sentence of the court--
-My lords!

1381
01:50:16,600 --> 01:50:20,388
When I was practising the law,
the manner was to ask the prisoner...

1382
01:50:20,520 --> 01:50:24,274
...before pronouncing sentence,
if he had anything to say.

1383
01:50:24,640 --> 01:50:26,358
Have you anything to say?

1384
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:27,989
Yes.

1385
01:50:38,680 --> 01:50:41,638
Since the court has determined
to condemn me...

1386
01:50:42,720 --> 01:50:44,392
...God knoweth how...

1387
01:50:45,440 --> 01:50:48,591
...I will now discharge my mind...

1388
01:50:49,160 --> 01:50:53,312
...concerning the indictment
and the King's title.

1389
01:50:56,720 --> 01:51:01,032
The indictment is grounded
in an act of parliament...

1390
01:51:01,400 --> 01:51:04,119
...which is directly repugnant...

1391
01:51:04,200 --> 01:51:07,715
...to the law of God and His Holy Church.

1392
01:51:07,880 --> 01:51:11,953
The supreme government of which
no temperable person...

1393
01:51:12,040 --> 01:51:16,033
...may by any law
presume to take upon him.

1394
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:18,518
This was granted...

1395
01:51:19,240 --> 01:51:20,673
...by the mouth...

1396
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:23,834
...of our Saviour, Christ Himself...

1397
01:51:24,680 --> 01:51:29,037
...to St. Peter and the bishops of Rome
whilst He lived...

1398
01:51:29,720 --> 01:51:32,871
...and was personally present...

1399
01:51:35,200 --> 01:51:36,758
...here on earth.

1400
01:51:38,920 --> 01:51:42,595
It is therefore insufficient in law...

1401
01:51:43,200 --> 01:51:46,033
...to charge any Christian to obey it.

1402
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:48,873
And more than this...

1403
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:53,590
...the immunity of the Church is promised
both in Magna Carta...

1404
01:51:53,720 --> 01:51:57,156
...and in the King's own coronation oath.

1405
01:51:58,920 --> 01:52:01,434
Now, we plainly see you are malicious!

1406
01:52:01,920 --> 01:52:03,114
Not so.

1407
01:52:05,440 --> 01:52:07,431
I am the King's true subject...

1408
01:52:08,280 --> 01:52:11,750
...and I pray for him and all the realm.

1409
01:52:13,480 --> 01:52:14,993
I do none harm.

1410
01:52:16,120 --> 01:52:17,917
I say none harm.

1411
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:21,075
I think none harm.

1412
01:52:23,080 --> 01:52:25,992
And if this be not enough
to keep a man alive...

1413
01:52:26,400 --> 01:52:29,836
...then in good faith, I long not to live.

1414
01:52:31,840 --> 01:52:33,068
Nevertheless...

1415
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:38,391
...it is not for the supremacy
that you have sought my blood...

1416
01:52:38,480 --> 01:52:42,519
...but because I would not bend
to the marriage!

1417
01:52:50,600 --> 01:52:53,592
You have been found guilty of high treason.

1418
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:57,312
The sentence of the court
is that you be taken...

1419
01:52:57,440 --> 01:52:59,271
...to the Tower of London...

1420
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:04,517
...until the day hence to the appointment...

1421
01:53:05,480 --> 01:53:07,471
...for your execution!

1422
01:53:22,440 --> 01:53:25,557
I am commanded by the King to be brief...

1423
01:53:26,280 --> 01:53:29,078
...and since I am
the King's obedient subject...

1424
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:31,079
...brief I will be.

1425
01:53:32,520 --> 01:53:35,637
I die His Majesty's good servant...

1426
01:53:36,600 --> 01:53:38,113
...but God's first.

1427
01:53:44,680 --> 01:53:46,875
I forgive you, right readily.

1428
01:53:52,680 --> 01:53:54,875
Be not afraid of your office.

1429
01:53:55,280 --> 01:53:56,918
You send me to God.

1430
01:53:59,280 --> 01:54:01,157
You're very sure of that, Sir Thomas?

1431
01:54:01,240 --> 01:54:04,437
He will not refuse one who is so blithe
to go to him.

1432
01:54:26,280 --> 01:54:29,590
Thomas More's head was stuck
on Traitor's Gate for a month.

1433
01:54:29,680 --> 01:54:33,389
Then his daughter, Margaret,
removed it and kept it 'til her death.

1434
01:54:34,160 --> 01:54:37,914
Cromwell was beheaded for high treason
five years after More.

1435
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:40,960
The Archbishop was burned at the stake.

1436
01:54:41,560 --> 01:54:44,597
The Duke of Norfolk should have
been executed for high treason...

1437
01:54:44,680 --> 01:54:47,558
...but the King died of syphilis
the night before.

1438
01:54:48,480 --> 01:54:51,278
Richard Rich became
Chancellor of England...

1439
01:54:51,880 --> 01:54:53,632
...and died in his bed.
