from the backwoods of America.

It was an unknown sport with roots
based on freedom, flow, self expression...

and a lifestyle that offered
a truly unique feeling that defied description.

During its brief,
but chaotic history,

93
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:51,401
snowboarding would battle the establishment,
overcome prejudice and fght to keep its soul.

94
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:54,173
And in just 25 years
it would spread around the world...

00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:57,409
and change the face of sports
as we know it today.

96

Snowboarding is so young,
and it came about so quickly,

that there wasn't really a chance...

and be concrete.

I got exposed to the whole concept

The Snurfer was a product

to surf the board.

Well, surfing in those days
was all about nose riding.

So, I didn't think of
having a big kick on the front.

00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,720
The Chugach is just one of
many, many mountain ranges in Alaska.

145
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:30,023
Whatever you want's out there.
If you want cornices, they're out there.
If you want wind lips, it's out there.

146
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:34,225
And the whole thing is,
just make sure
you find the one that you want.

147
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:39,227
Back in the early days,
when everything was untouched,

148
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:43,503
you could just go
right across the street
and get an untouched mountain.

149
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:48,236
This is a good example
of most of the runs up here.

150
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:51,374
Steep, gnarly at the top.
You cannot see
your first four or five turns.

151
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,817
But once you get over that edge,
everything comes into place.

152
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:57,253
Looks pretty steep,
that one mountain right there.

153
00:15:57,323 --> 00:16:01,384
It's always going to look steeper to your eye
when you're flying in a helicopter
or when you're looking at a photo.

154
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,894
It's still going to be steep,
but not as steep as-

155
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,897
To me it works opposite.
Really?

156
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,832
I get into it,
but, damn, this is steep.
This is steeper than I thought.

157
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:13,235
That's what I'm concerned with-
going off,like, a wind lip
or something and then just-

158
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:18,766
'Cause I've never really
landed in powder that often.
Like, landing and then rolling.

I've never really been in
a controlled environment...

165

where I had to watch out
for upcoming stuff...

166
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:48,804
and look forward and be, like,
""I gotta think about this before I do it''
instead of just go for it.

167
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:53,641
Gotta actually visualize
and map it out inside my head.

168
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,615
If you can see the bottom,
follow Farm.

Alaska, to me, to my friends,
is the pinnacle of snowboarding.

There's nothing
as big and vast and grand.

172

we knew that's where we wanted to be.
It was like, God, this is rad.

173

Pretty much everything you can ask for,

somebody who wants to have
a really good time on a snowboard.

175

[ Perata ] There's so many
undiscovered mountains out there still
that no one's even seen.

176
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:40,648
It's just unfathomable
how many mountains are out there.

[ Farmer ]
Once you ride powder,you never forget it.
It's like a drug. It brings you back every time.

178
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:55,132
I'm a little scared.
At first, I was really scared.

Like, man,
I've never done this stuffbefore.!

180
00:17:57,843 --> 00:18:02,246
It's just such a different mind-set out here.
You get a respect for how big everything is.

181
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,895
Avalanches
are our biggest concerns.

182
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:21,057
Crevasses. It's always scary.
You never know what to expect.

183
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,727
You just have to know your outs,
know where your safe zones are.

184
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:26,635
[ Farmer ]
You have to be aware
that something can go wrong.

185
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:28,969
And when it does,
it's usually catastrophic.

186
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,475
[ Perata ]
You'll never be totally
comfortable up here. Never.

187
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:35,673
And if you are,you shouldn't be here,
because all around you the mountains are alive.

188
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:41,083
Unless you're fully prepared to be
in a situation oflife or death,

189
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:43,144
you shouldn't be up here.

190
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:59,470
[ Farmer ] You can't get lulled
into a sense of anything being routine
up here, because it's not.

191
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:02,405
When you're flying and you're
getting on top of these mountains,

192
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,908
you better pay attention
to what the hell is going on.

193

your life or your friend's life.

194

[ Perata ]
Biggest thing that would bum me out
is if somebody got hurt or killed up here...

195
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:43,073
in my backyard, in the place
that I've been riding for 1 5 years.

196
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:48,381
It's always been my thing.
I feel like the mother hen out here,
and, you know, I would feel responsible.

197
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:52,583
It always crossed my mind that I'd end up
coming out here when I was a lot older.

198
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:56,958
I always thought that I'd master everything
and then take over on this thing.

199
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,897
I think it'd be a good time for me
now, though, to get some experience.

200
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:09,673
If something spectacular happens
or it's obviouslyjust got to be that way,
then I'm ready to throw down like that.

But at the same time,
I'm not going to try to kill myself, really.

And that's what appealed
to all the young people.

of a free-riding spirit...

to do and express yourself.

The bad downside to that
would be,

234
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:25,208
you have to live up to some
pre-concept that people have.

00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:45,633

;[ Man Singing Rock ]

284
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:55,686
It was all about slashing
and finding walls...

285
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:59,019
and trying those skate maneuvers
on my snowboard.

286
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,957
I think it was a pretty rowdy crowd
at the beginning.

287
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:06,157
Snowboarding was basically,
you know,just punk rock kids
just wanting to go out and thrash,

288
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:10,031
be aggressive
andjust try to express themselves.

289

They're, like, a lot ofkids
with a lot energy.

290
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:18,475
The music we were listening to
told us to, you know, thrash, have fun.
Fuck authority.

291
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:20,943
Freeze!
Not that funny.

292
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:24,345
[ Richards ]
This whole, like,
anti-authority movement...

293
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:29,183
definitely pushed the sport
in the direction of free thinking-
you'd go and do what you wanted to do.

294
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:32,519
The sport was yours to mold.

295
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:38,052
We were stoked to be a part
of something that felt like our own.
It wasn't welcome at all from the skiers.

296
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:41,889
[ Man ]
Is that good enough?
I think so.

297
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:46,136
I think when
snowboarding came along...

298
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:52,040
and the skier establishment
saw this new thing that they
really didn't understand,

299
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:56,638
they couldn't help
but reject it and try to ban it.

300
00:26:56,715 --> 00:27:00,378
I remember the first day
we went snowboarding.
We weren't allowed on the ski lifts.

301
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,943
So we hiked up
along the side of the run.

302
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:08,049
And I remember getting heckled
from the skiers, and that look, like,
what are they riding on?

303
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,822
There was less than half a dozen
ski areas...

304
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:15,525
that allowed snowboarding
on planet Earth in 1 982 and 1 983.

305
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,094
The ski industry
thought that this was a fad-
"We want nothing to do with this. '"

306
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:24,801
I'd get letters from ski companies saying,
""Stop making these things.''

307
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:28,277
[ Burton ] We knew we were entitled to it.
I think there was this feeling
that it was going to happen.

308
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:32,043
But,yeah,
when big resorts caved in
you'd get a phone call-

309
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:37,077
""Hey, we can get on Vail.''
And it was, like, ""No way!''
It was such cool news at the time.

310
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:47,898
All of the sudden there was
these weird people on their hill,
and they didn't follow a tradition in skiing.

311
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:56,198
[ Man ] We were taking creative lines
down the mountain
that skiers weren't taking.

312
00:27:56,274 --> 00:28:00,643
They thought we were going to
injure ourselves or injure some other people.

313
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:02,976
Which was not really the case.

314
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:11,379
Was there a prejudice from
skiers towards snowboarders?
I think absolutely.

315
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:15,051
Snowboarders seem to be
a little wilder and take up more room.

316
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:18,118
We were standing in line
and three of them cut in front of us.

317
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:21,791
Wejust didn't want to bug with them
because we thought they
might have guns or something.

318
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:25,802
And I think, as I look back in my career,
when it was really a bad boy image,

319
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:29,806
snowboarders, I must admit,
deserved some of the criticism
they were getting.

320
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:32,468
They're looking down at you,
and you like that, though,
when you're a kid.

321
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,569
""Yeah, I'm a scumbag.
I'm riding a snowboard.''

322
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:38,582
What it did is gave you
that angst and that energy
to go out and prove them wrong.

323
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:42,814
You know, prove to them
that you could go out and enjoy it
just as much or more than they could.

324
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:45,822
There was some behavior
and attitude problems.

325
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,757
There was a lot of language
from both sides.

326
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:52,661
I hope you get hit in the face.
You're an asshole to everyone
who goes by here.

327
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,961
[ Barfoot ]
You got a kid with
a lot of freedom in his mind...

328
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:57,627
and someone turning around,
telling him,you know, "I hate snowboarders. '"

329
00:28:57,702 --> 00:29:01,194
So, he turns around and is, like,
"I'm going to do what I want. '"

330
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:04,139
And then it turned into,
like, almost a mental war.

331
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:09,377
Theyjust weren't ready to let go of their skis
and get on a snowboard.

332
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,349
Even though
I'm a little bit of a geezer,

333
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,353
I've been snowboarding myself
full-time for six years.

334
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,355
I've never been back on skis.

335
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,790
I took it up when I was 60
andjust ride with
all the young guys around here.

336
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:26,422
It's great.
I've been totally hooked for six years,
and I just don't ski anymore.

337
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:42,413
Usually, I don't ride with people
in these mountains...

338
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,473
unless they're really good
at using all the safety equipment-

339
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:48,542
probe pole, beacon, harness.

340
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:52,556
You need to know who's in your group
and what kind of skills they have
with this type of gear,

341
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,525
because it could be my life
that they're trying to save.

342
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:57,584
Seven-four!
Seven-one!

343
00:29:57,662 --> 00:30:00,222
Me and Farm
dug them both out in four minutes.

344
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:04,667
That's survivable time with no
brain damage or anything like that.
Maybe some hypothermia.

345
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:08,194
So if they beat four minutes,
then I'm gonna say, ""Yeah,
they were listening real good.''

346
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:11,208
If they don't beat four minutes
and it comes to seven, to eight,

347
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:14,143
now, potentially,
we have a body recovery instead of,
you know, saving your friend.

348
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:16,339
All right, this way.
So, we'll see.

349
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:18,348
Are we getting so close?
I'm finding it.

I hit something.
Is it squishy?

Did you get it?
Yeah!

355
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:38,235
Every time I've been told about
the backcountry, they'rejust
like, "Listen,you know,

356
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:42,399
even though your friend's buried,
you still have to take your time
and just find him.''

357
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:45,772
I mean,
there's no use in just panicking
and going like this everywhere.

358
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,778
It just doesn't do anything.

359
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,781
They found the beacon in two minutes.
They found it quicker than me and Nick.

360
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,579
So I'm sure they can handle it.

361
00:30:56,654 --> 00:31:00,021
[ Teter ] A while ago, Shaun and I
were talking about, like, whoa,
we've never done this before.

362
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:02,787
Like, we don't wanna die up there.

363
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:07,423
Not bugging out about it,
but being, like, I don't know-
feelin'a little stressed on it.

364
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:11,992
You know, I want to be safe,
but I still want to learn a lot.
I want to learn about backcountry riding.

365
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,300
And I want to progress,you know.

366
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:20,076
[ Perata ]
This is called Kiwijunior.

367
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:25,275
It's a good little run.
It's not too much exposure, but there are
places where you can get hurt, definitely.

368
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,285
It's probably some of
the best snow that we've found.

369
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:31,288
So, there's four or fve lines
in here that we can rip.

370
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:34,291
And it's just kind of a little warm-up
for the finrst shot of the day.

371
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:37,294
Once you drop in, the slough's
going to be on either side of it.

372
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:39,296
So you gotta get on the middle.

373
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:42,299
If you don't get on the middle,
you're gonna get pulled off either side.

374
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:45,666
There's a little
chocolate chip to the left.
See it?

375
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:50,674
We land the helicopter,
and you look at this big mountain face
and you're, like, ""Okay, pick your line.''

376
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:54,701
And I'm trying to look
at the mountain that way,
but I don't see it.

They are so out of their element up here.

It's a gut-wrenching feeling
when you know they can do it,

be able to do it?

because it's no longer
just, like, little runs.

384

I felt like I'd accomplished this huge feat.

one of the mellow runs of Alaska.

just such a big thing for me.

You snowboard long enough,

01:11:12,201 --> 01:11:16,035
and you get an eye for trying
to fgure out the line.

He's been looking for the line
ever since he was, like, 1 5.

You always pick the lines
where it's hard to get to.

on top of that last feature.

So much of snowboarding is-

876
01:14:35,504 --> 01:14:39,440
all you have is what nature gives you
as far as features.

877
01:14:39,508 --> 01:14:42,170

is exploration,

trying to find,you know,
the perfect feature.

879
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:53,581
[ Haakonsen ]
Some of the progression, I think, too,
is, like, how good are you to play?

880
01:14:53,655 --> 01:14:56,715
Travis is a really good example.
He can play with any kind of terrain.

01:14:56,792 --> 01:15:00,284
That's what makes him such
a well-rounded snowboarder.

or not what you expected.

pick lines like that if you want to be

01:24:32,233 --> 01:24:36,101
It was unfortunate,you know,
to have the whole scandal...

01:24:36,171 --> 01:24:39,299
with Ross testing positive
for marijuana.

983
01:24:39,374 --> 01:24:43,504
They wanted to strip his medal, and then
they finally allowed him to have it...

984
01:24:43,578 --> 01:24:45,637
Because that wasn't one
of the banned substances.

985
01:24:45,713 --> 01:24:47,647
So because
that whole thing happened,

986
01:24:47,715 --> 01:24:51,048
they cut 80% of the coverage
of snowboarding...

I'd say that's a good kick-off
for the Olympics for snowboarding.

[ Narrator ]
Four years later
the Salt Lake City games...

995
01:25:22,984 --> 01:25:26,215
would show snowboarding
in a much different light...

996
01:25:26,287 --> 01:25:29,450
and forever change the mainstream's
perception of the sport.

Kelly Clark won the finrst gold
for the United States
during that Olympics,

998
01:25:34,796 --> 01:25:37,060
and that was a huge deal.

999
01:25:37,132 --> 01:25:39,464
It really got the attention
of the American public.

1000
01:25:39,534 --> 01:25:42,401
They actually gave it
the coverage that it deserved,

1001
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:45,405
and America finally got to see
snowboarding competition,

how it could be.

swept anything in the Olympics,

and the dirtbag, Danny Kass.

1010
01:26:06,027 --> 01:26:09,087
I think it was, like, kind of like
a morale booster for the States.

1011
01:26:09,164 --> 01:26:11,894
I was just more pumped
that my family was there.
A lot of them came out.

really kicked in.

or there's this sketchy, rocky gorge.

and have a look at 760 1.

Whenever you're doing the grand finale,
