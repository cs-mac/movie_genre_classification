00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:46,274
The nuclear industry is a death industry.

2
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,083
It's a cancer industry.

3
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:51,125
It's a bomb industry.

4
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:55,000
It's killing people
and will for the rest of time.

5
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:57,708
Well, why doesn't
President Obama know this?

6
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,950
He's an intelligent man.
He's got 2 little girls he loves.

7
00:01:01,004 --> 00:01:04,583
What the hell does he think he's up to,
supporting the nuclear industry?

8
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:05,916
It's wicked.

9
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,859
Do you mind if I use
the "F" word?

10
00:01:11,914 --> 00:01:12,875
Can I use the "F" word?

11
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:16,250
We can get rid of all these
fucking nuclear plants right away

12
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:20,916
because we can switch to solar, wind,
tidal, geothermal, ocean thermal...

13
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:24,333
all that energy is available
to do today.

14
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:27,125
We can shut all the
nuclear plants

15
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:30,958
and all the coal, all the oil
and all the gas plants.

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,390
We can shut them down.

17
00:01:32,429 --> 00:01:34,083
We have the technology.

18
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:36,225

been thinking all this time</i>

21
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:55,083

<i>My mind was made up, definitely.</i>

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
<i>So I needed a lot of input.</i>

56
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,642
<i>I didn't know what the scale
of the radiation release was going to be,</i>

<i>I didn't know whether people
were going to be injured.</i>

58
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,791
<i>The fact that this was happening live
on TV and that there were explosions,</i>

<i>not to hoard bottled water.</i>

<i>So you have these awful images
of total devastation from a tsunami,</i>

64
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:22,791
<i>and the story was a nuclear power accident.</i>

65
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,708
<i>It all got muddled together.</i>

66
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,250
<i>Some people on the West Coast

67

<i>- that the radiation could travel 5,000 miles...
- I hadn't been pro-nuclear all that long</i>

68
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:36,000
<i>before the Fukushima plant
started to melt-down.</i>

69
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:39,625
<i>It's hard to watch that happening
and not insert the question of</i>

70
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:43,041
<i>whether or not this is an energy source
that is really safe.</i>

What do you think, Mark?

00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:57,125
- I feel like a bit of an idiot, actually.
- Why?

80
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:01,083
I don't know,
because it's sort of...

81
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:03,291
I'm wearing radiation clothing.

82
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,458
It shouldn't be necessary.

SPECIAL SECURITY ZONE
FUKUSHIMA POLICE DEPARTMENT

84
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:18,023
It must be absolutely awful
to have your town wiped out by a tsunami

85
00:07:18,054 --> 00:07:20,252
and earthquake, and you can't even
come back and rebuild,

86
00:07:20,254 --> 00:07:23,375
because the whole place
is contaminated by radiation.

87
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:27,737
Even if it's not massively contaminated,
it's contaminated enough

88
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,583
that it scares the shit out of you.
And I think that's...

89
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,208
you know, nobody can look you in the eye
and say: "You shouldn't be worried."

90
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:41,166
Um, you know, there's no other
energy source that does this,

91
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:48,166
that leaves huge areas contaminated
by this strange invisible presence

92
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:51,416
which, you know,
is potentially deadly, you know.

93
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,613
Everything has it's drawbacks,
everything has it's risks

94
00:07:53,615 --> 00:07:57,250
but this is something that is
unique to nuclear.

95
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:03,875
I guess I can understand why people are
scared of nuclear power as a whole.

96
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,625
You know, it's um...

97
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,125
it's kind of eerie.

98
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:16,500
So, um, yeah, I would say
I'm having a wobble.

99
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:20,625
I can see why we'd want to do
without nuclear power, I really can.

This parking lot is the hottest spot
in the whole exclusion zone.

102
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,208
This place got some serious
fallout, I think.

103
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,648
So, are you still pro-nuclear?

104
00:08:39,703 --> 00:08:42,648
Um, am I still pro-nuclear?

105
00:08:42,718 --> 00:08:47,125
Ask me in a few days, when I've had
a chance to get my head around it, alright?

106
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:51,083
Are you still pro-nuclear?

107
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,833
To start the chain reaction, all we need
is one neutron.

108
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:32,125
I think you can see
what is going to happen.

109
00:09:32,934 --> 00:09:34,351
Watch.

110
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:41,750
<i>My first introduction to nuclear power
was quite nice.</i>

111
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:46,375
<i>It was a Disney movie called:
"Our Friend the Atom".</i>

112
00:09:47,617 --> 00:09:51,476
The atom was going to
bring about a wonderful revolution

113
00:09:51,515 --> 00:09:53,791
in the way we got our energy.

114
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:57,958
<i>And, there was a nuclear powered
submarine called the Nautilus...</i>

115
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,166
<i>that went under the North Pole and us kids
were really enthusiastic about that.</i>

116
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:08,041
<i>And then, when I was in my early teens,
Admiral Rickover came to give a speech.</i>

117
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:12,916
<i>And, my dad knew I was interested
in science, so he took me.</i>

118
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:15,000
Watch the control rods come out.

119
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:18,708
As the control rods come out,
the reactor starts.

120
00:10:18,747 --> 00:10:21,875
And water starts
encirculating through here.

121
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:24,791
<i>He was a wonderful speaker and
he was very inspiring</i>

122
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:28,541
<i>about American technology
and about the future</i>

123
00:10:29,067 --> 00:10:34,708
<i>and he talked about nuclear energy
being used to light up cities,</i>

124
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,166
<i>not just run submarines.</i>

125
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:42,041
So, it was a generally positive notion.

126
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,458
<i>I got into the nuclear business
in early 1948.</i>

127
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:58,583
<i>Prior to that I was working on engines
for the Tucker automobile.</i>

128
00:10:59,449 --> 00:11:03,916
<i>Everything we had done, up until that time,
that produced energy</i>

129
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,250
<i>was by burning something.</i>

130
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,845
The enticement in the nuclear business
was the fact that it was a new

source of energy,
a new way to generate heat.

133
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:18,125
<i>But the equivalence is huge.</i>

134
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:23,291
<i>One pound of uranium,
which is the size of my fingertip,</i>

135
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:26,000
<i>if you could release all of the energy,</i>

136
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:30,208
<i>has the equivalent of about
5,000 barrels of oil.</i>

137
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,541
<i>And that, to me, is amazing.</i>

138
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:44,708
<i>I worked at
Argonne National Laboratory, in Idaho.</i>

139
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:49,000
<i>Which really was the headquarters in the
world for nuclear power at the time.</i>

140
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:54,166
<i>We were building this first in the world
experimental breeder reactor.</i>

141
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:59,791
EBR-I was an experiment just to prove that
the concept made sense, scientifically.

142
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:03,458
<i>Everything happened
just like we expected it to.</i>

143
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,666
<i>The reactors went critical.</i>

144
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:11,504
<i>Critical means that you have enough
uranium so that it generates heat.</i>

145
00:12:11,528 --> 00:12:14,125
<i>All the reactor does is generate heat.</i>

146
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,880
<i>The end product is steam,</i>

147
00:12:16,887 --> 00:12:20,420
<i>and then once you have steam, it's the same
whether you generate the electricity</i>

148
00:12:20,428 --> 00:12:24,750
<i>with oil, or coal, or gas, or...
just as long as you have a source of heat.</i>

149
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:30,875
<i>So, we generated electricity
and then we hooked-up 4 light bulbs.</i>

150
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,666
<i>And we lit the light bulbs
from atomic energy.</i>

151
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,280
December 20, 1951

152
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:38,125
<i>Nobody else had done it before.</i>

153
00:12:40,585 --> 00:12:43,958
But the fact that
the whole nuclear business,

154
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,666
atomic energy, was started
for a bomb, and used as a bomb...

155
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:51,791
and I think that put the
negative side on it.

156
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,958
SAN ANTONIO, NEW MEXICO
July 16, 1945

157
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
<i>I'm just old enough to have
conscious memory of World War II,</i>

158
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:05,208
<i>and the ending of World War II.</i>

159
00:13:08,433 --> 00:13:10,666
MONUMENT AT TRINITY SITE
White Sands, New Mexico
First nuclear test site

160
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:13,875
<i>Nuclear bombs were not just a weapon.</i>

161
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:18,541
<i>They were a little window
into some kind of Armageddon.</i>

162
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:30,650
<i>The photographs and the films
and the stories</i>

163
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:34,125
<i>that came out of Hiroshima and Nagasaki...</i>

164
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,708
<i>those things cut pretty deep.</i>

165
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:48,820
So, you had this
very strong residue of

166
00:13:48,851 --> 00:13:53,578
this is not primarily an energy source,
this is primarily a weapon,

167
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,625
uh, that we feel very badly about.

168
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:07,958
<i>And then the testing went on and on.</i>

169
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:13,125
<i>We're hearing about the radiation
from strontium-90.</i>

170
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,125
<i>And then the Russians were doing tests.</i>

171
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,708
<i>Ah, the Chinese were doing tests.</i>

172
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,208
<i>And before it really slowed down,</i>

173
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:31,083
<i>there were over 2000 tests
with nuclear weapons.</i>

174
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:45,041
<i>I grew up having nightmares
that my home town was bombed into oblivion</i>

175
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,439
<i>and I was the only survivor.</i>

176
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:51,125
Those kids were in school doing
duck-and-cover routines under the desks

177
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:55,041
and the back yard fallout shelters
and all that stuff,

178
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,250
made it all pretty personal.

179
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:13,041
<i>I grew up in an
anti-nuclear family.</i>

180
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:15,958
<i>You know, my parents were
children of the '60s.</i>

181
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,458
<i>They were liberals and environmentalists.</i>

182
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:25,083
To actually believe in nuclear power was,
by definition to be a dupe.

183
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:28,208
Every step along the way,
measures will be taken

184
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,369
to guarantee that
our plant at Connecticut Yankee

185
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,125
contributes to the beneficial

186
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,595
and harmonious development
of the Connecticut Valley.

187
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:38,375
The Haddam Neck site
will be artfully landscaped

188
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:41,500
so that the buildings harmonize
with its wooded background.

189
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:44,416
Plans even call for an information
and educational centre

190
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:47,083
for those wishing
to visit the Haddam Neck project.

191
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:54,759
<i>I actually visited the nuclear power plant
with my buddies in high school.</i>

192
00:15:54,822 --> 00:15:58,606
<i>And we knew enough
to have a very sarcastic attitude</i>

193
00:15:58,645 --> 00:16:01,687
<i>toward the tour they gave us.</i>

194
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,708
<i>They would say:
"It's this clean source of energy,</i>

195
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:08,000
"it's really safe, it doesn't have
anything to do with nuclear weapons."

196
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:12,208
And we would just laugh,
we thought they were all "tools,"

197
00:16:12,246 --> 00:16:16,996
stooges of the nuclear industry
and its propaganda campaign.

198
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:26,642
<i>Of course, that gets reinforced for people
in my generation with The Simpsons.</i>

199
00:16:26,673 --> 00:16:29,000
<i>Warning: problem in sector 7-G.</i>

200
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:31,791
7-G? Good God,
who's the safety inspector there?

201
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:35,416
<i>Where the evil character is the C.E.O.
of the nuclear power company.</i>

202
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:38,041
Simpson, eh?
Good man? Intelligent?

203
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:42,019
<i>And Homer Simpson is bumbling
while the whole thing is melting down.</i>

204
00:16:42,066 --> 00:16:46,666
Doh! Whoever thought that
a nuclear reactor would be so complicated?

205
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:52,000
You just always had the sense that
nuclear power was something sinister,

206
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:54,291
something that was a lurking danger.

207
00:16:59,744 --> 00:17:03,703
<i>I was against nuclear power
because I was an environmentalist.</i>

208
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:08,125
I am an environmentalist...
and the two things go together.

209
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,875
Certainly, that always
seemed to be the case.

210
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:16,166
<i>Looking back, I suppose you could say
that I was a hard-core activist.</i>

211
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,908
<i>It's almost like being in a battle-zone.</i>

212
00:17:20,955 --> 00:17:24,083
<i>It's the kind of experience
that most people never have.</i>

213
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:29,125
<i>Where you're battling the forces of evil
almost on a day to day basis.</i>

214
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:30,916
<i>"Evil" being the big corporations,</i>

215
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:33,541
<i>those who are making profit out of
Earth's destruction;</i>

216
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:36,166
<i>and "good" being us.</i>

217
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,666
The slogan was:
"No compromise in defence of Mother Earth."

218
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:46,458
That was the original
Earth First slogan.

219
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,916
And it's one I still subscribe to,
on a very deep level I think.

220
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,583
<i>Well, I mean,
nuclear power was evil.</i>

221
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,375
<i>No doubt about it.</i>

222
00:18:00,344 --> 00:18:02,302
Who are the criminals?

223
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:08,041
<i>I was writing for national magazines
many years ago.</i>

224
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:11,958
<i>Writing articles about the dangers
of nuclear power.</i>

225
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,125
<i>And I had the standard point-of-view
that I think, many journalists still have:</i>

226
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:20,250
<i>that it must be bad.</i>

227
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,208
<i>I came to realize</i>

228
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:29,458
<i>they basically avoided
looking at the whole picture</i>

229
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:33,916
<i>and only looked at the questions that
seemed to prove to them</i>

230
00:18:34,209 --> 00:18:38,965
<i>that nuclear power was dangerous...
as I had too.</i>

231
00:18:41,506 --> 00:18:43,875
The only reason I changed my mind is

232
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:47,833
that I talked to experts, physicists
in particular,

233
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:51,375
<i>who were the pioneers of nuclear energy.</i>

234
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:55,166
<i>And who carefully, one by one,
explained to me</i>

235
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:59,333
<i>again and again,
until it finally got through my head</i>

236
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:04,291
<i>why it wasn't what the anti-nuclear
activists felt it was...</i>

237
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:06,750
<i>believed it was.</i>

238
00:19:12,566 --> 00:19:16,233
<i>I was right there
at the beginning of this.</i>

239
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:20,941
<i>It was my chance to
do something for humankind.</i>

240
00:19:21,608 --> 00:19:25,525
<i>This, after all,
was an unlimited source of energy.</i>

241
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:32,566
<i>I assumed that all electrical power,
if we were successful,</i>

242
00:19:32,608 --> 00:19:35,233
<i>would be generated by nuclear means.</i>

243
00:19:40,066 --> 00:19:45,900
<i>In the '50s there were essentially
two kinds of reactors being developed.</i>

244
00:19:46,276 --> 00:19:51,066
<i>The breeder reactor, which EBR-1
was a prototype for,</i>

245
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,983
<i>and the light water reactor.</i>

246
00:19:57,316 --> 00:20:02,941
<i>The breeder reactor breeds plutonium
and can recycle it over and over again</i>

247
00:20:02,983 --> 00:20:05,066
<i>It's a very good fuel.</i>

248
00:20:08,233 --> 00:20:11,941
<i>The light water reactor is
a much simpler reactor,</i>

249
00:20:11,983 --> 00:20:15,025
<i>but it produces much more waste.</i>

250
00:20:15,483 --> 00:20:24,217
It was chosen by Admiral Rickover
to be the reactor for the submarine.

251
00:20:22,191 --> 00:20:24,233
CHARLES TILL
Nuclear Physics Pioneer

252
00:20:24,275 --> 00:20:27,566
There are many things to be said
for light water reactors,

253
00:20:27,608 --> 00:20:30,150
and there are some to be said against.

254
00:20:31,816 --> 00:20:36,441
<i>But, with Rickover's influence,
the light water reactor</i>

255
00:20:36,483 --> 00:20:40,483
<i>became the principal commercial reactor
around the world.</i>

256
00:20:41,358 --> 00:20:43,650
We developed water reactors,

257
00:20:43,654 --> 00:20:48,886
but we looked upon that as sort of a
near-term, short-range stepping stone

258
00:20:48,964 --> 00:20:53,150
<i>to real nuclear power:
the breeder reactor.</i>

259
00:20:53,191 --> 00:20:55,924
<i>That's what we considered to be
the most likely,</i>

260
00:20:55,926 --> 00:20:59,900
<i>real long-range
future for nuclear power.</i>

261
00:21:00,358 --> 00:21:03,108
<i>But, the water reactor
got marketed first.</i>

262
00:21:10,525 --> 00:21:13,275
<i>This was partly a commercial move
on our part.</i>

263
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:18,650
<i>In the early 1950's we were concerned
that the Soviet Union,</i>

264
00:21:18,691 --> 00:21:20,816
<i>which had kept pace with us</i>

265
00:21:20,858 --> 00:21:23,983
<i>in the development
of nuclear reactors for power,</i>

266
00:21:24,353 --> 00:21:28,775
would steal a march on us and
get the commercial business in Europe.

267
00:21:30,118 --> 00:21:31,941
<i>So, President Eisenhower decided</i>

268
00:21:31,983 --> 00:21:37,040
<i>to share the benefits
of nuclear energy with other countries.</i>

269
00:21:38,941 --> 00:21:41,339
<i>It's called: Atoms for Peace.</i>

270
00:21:44,983 --> 00:21:47,358
<i>We've had 50 years now
of water reactors,</i>

271
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,025
<i>400 of them, roughly,
all over the world.</i>

272
00:21:50,066 --> 00:21:54,191
<i>And they've produced a hell-of-a-lot
of waste that we didn't anticipate.</i>

273
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:58,025
You know, you've mentioned a
100,000 years of stuff

274
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:01,191
that you gotta keep isolated
from the rest of the world,

275
00:22:01,233 --> 00:22:03,316
it's enough to scare a lot of people.

276
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,275
<i>There was perhaps a price we paid
for commercialization,</i>

277
00:22:11,316 --> 00:22:14,108
<i>in the sense that we didn't look ahead.</i>

278
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:29,400
<i>Nuclear power was developed
as a kind of a boutique energy source</i>

279
00:22:29,441 --> 00:22:34,233
<i>by utilities executives
who really didn't know much about it.</i>

280
00:22:36,733 --> 00:22:40,191
<i>I talked to people who said,
"Well, I heard about it on the golf course</i>

281
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:42,733
<i>"from the guy who
runs the plant down the road.</i>

282
00:22:42,775 --> 00:22:46,066
<i>"He's going to build one,
and so I thought I should too."</i>

283
00:22:52,108 --> 00:22:56,733
<i>The first commercial nuclear power plant,
that was built in the United States,</i>

284
00:22:56,775 --> 00:23:00,275
<i>was built in
Shippingport, Pennsylvania.</i>

285
00:23:04,066 --> 00:23:07,983
<i>It was a modified version
of a large submarine reactor.</i>

286
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:14,025
<i>One of the major reasons
the power company wanted it,</i>

287
00:23:14,066 --> 00:23:17,420
<i>was because there was a lot of
coal pollution in Pittsburgh.</i>

288
00:23:17,459 --> 00:23:23,941
<i>And nuclear energy looked to people to be,
as it is, a clean form of energy.</i>

289
00:23:25,358 --> 00:23:29,233
<i>The first power reactors were fairly small.</i>

290
00:23:29,275 --> 00:23:33,983
<i>But the push by the
power and light companies of America</i>

291
00:23:34,025 --> 00:23:37,400
<i>was to scale them up as
quickly as possible.</i>

292
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:43,275
<i>Safety, instead of being inherent in
the design of the reactor itself,</i>

293
00:23:43,316 --> 00:23:46,983
<i>had to be engineered around it,
as it were.</i>

294
00:23:47,321 --> 00:23:50,020
<i>You had to have
multiple core-cooling systems</i>

295
00:23:50,022 --> 00:23:52,189
<i>that had to be added on</i>

296
00:23:52,215 --> 00:23:56,623
<i>to anticipate possible break-downs
of various kinds.</i>

297
00:23:57,316 --> 00:24:02,858
The odds of "X" happening or "Y" happening
were very small.

298
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:07,566
<i>But unlike the smaller reactors,
they really couldn't say it was impossible.</i>

299
00:24:08,062 --> 00:24:10,880
March 28, 1979

300
00:24:12,633 --> 00:24:17,109
<i>Late today, officials here in Washington summarized
briefly what seems to have caused the problem.</i>

301
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:20,941
<i>First, a pump in the generator system
broke down at 4:00 a.m. yesterday.</i>

302
00:24:20,983 --> 00:24:23,275
<i>The reactor immediately shut down.</i>

303
00:24:23,316 --> 00:24:26,108
<i>Reactor operators decided to
open the valves</i>

304
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:29,191
<i>and release radioactive water
from the reactor.</i>

305
00:24:29,233 --> 00:24:31,941
<i>That, apparently, may have been
the wrong thing to do.</i>

306
00:24:31,983 --> 00:24:35,441
<i>When the emergency core-cooling system
came on automatically,</i>

307
00:24:35,483 --> 00:24:37,275
<i>an operator turned it off.</i>

308
00:24:37,316 --> 00:24:39,483
<i>That too, apparently was a mistake.</i>

309
00:24:39,525 --> 00:24:44,275
<i>For then, high levels of radiation were
released inside the containment building.</i>

310
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:47,400
<i>And not until 3 hours later
was it realized</i>

311
00:24:47,441 --> 00:24:53,108
<i>that radiation was being released; and
in fact, was penetrating to the outside.</i>

312
00:24:53,775 --> 00:24:56,066
<i>Three Mile Island happened.</i>

313
00:24:56,441 --> 00:24:59,900
<i>And, the first thing I thought of is:</i>

314
00:24:59,941 --> 00:25:04,066
are those rays
coming out of Three Mile Island

315
00:25:04,108 --> 00:25:06,110
gonna come to New York and
harm my daughter?

316
00:25:06,112 --> 00:25:08,905
I remember standing in my
apartment and thinking:

317
00:25:09,442 --> 00:25:11,316
"What can," you know, "what can we do?"

318
00:25:11,358 --> 00:25:13,858
This is Jack Godell,
we have a serious condition.

319
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:18,025
You get everybody into safety areas,
and you make sure that they stay there.

320
00:25:18,775 --> 00:25:22,816
<i>Of course, 2 weeks earlier,
The China Syndrome had come out.</i>

321
00:25:22,858 --> 00:25:26,900
So I was already prepared to be
terrorized by this event.

322
00:25:26,941 --> 00:25:28,150
The China Syndrome.

323
00:25:29,025 --> 00:25:29,983
The what?

324
00:25:30,025 --> 00:25:33,566
If the core is exposed, for whatever
reason, the fuel heats the...

325
00:25:33,608 --> 00:25:35,441
<i>The idea behind
The China Syndrome</i>

326
00:25:35,483 --> 00:25:38,698
<i>is that the nuclear power plant
would melt down and it would</i>

327
00:25:38,784 --> 00:25:41,191
<i>burrow a hole
all the way to China.</i>

328
00:25:41,858 --> 00:25:44,451
Never mind that China is not actually
on the other side of the Earth

329
00:25:44,514 --> 00:25:47,540
as the United States, but,
that was the idea.

330
00:25:47,603 --> 00:25:51,858
That, the worst-case scenario
would be apocalyptic.

331
00:25:52,173 --> 00:25:56,066
...the number of the people killed would
depend upon which way the wind is blowing...

332
00:25:56,108 --> 00:25:59,358
...render an area the size of Pennsylvania,
permanently uninhabitable.

333
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:03,108
Not to mention the cancer that
would show up later.

334
00:26:04,608 --> 00:26:10,331
<i>That's when I think I began to conflate
nuclear power with nuclear weapons.</i>

335
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,441
<i>...from a leaking nuclear plant.</i>

336
00:26:12,483 --> 00:26:16,150
We don't want a radioactive wasteland,
whether it's from a bomb or a nuclear plant.

337
00:26:16,191 --> 00:26:20,275
That kind of... that's probably the
sort of thing I would have answered.

338
00:26:20,928 --> 00:26:24,358
<i>It just seemed like, okay,
nuclear anything is a bad idea.</i>

339
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,608
WASHINGTON, D.C.
May, 1979

340
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,167
I want to just say a few words
about The China Syndrome.

341
00:26:28,206 --> 00:26:30,233
My movie, The China Syndrome.

342
00:26:30,275 --> 00:26:35,441
Because, we continue to place
our health and safety

343
00:26:35,483 --> 00:26:38,150
in the hands of utility executives

344
00:26:38,191 --> 00:26:43,150
whose main goal in life
is to maximize profits,

345
00:26:43,191 --> 00:26:47,358
then we will see more Harrisburgs,
we will see more leaks

346
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,400
and we will see an
increase in the cancer epidemic

347
00:26:50,441 --> 00:26:53,233
that is already running rampant
in this country.

348
00:26:53,858 --> 00:26:59,525
No more nukes! No more nukes!
No more nukes!

NEW YORK September, 1979

Stopping atomic energy is
practising patriotism.

351
00:27:12,983 --> 00:27:16,691
Stopping atomic energy is
fighting cancer.

352
00:27:16,733 --> 00:27:20,066
Stopping atomic energy is
fighting inflation.

353
00:27:20,108 --> 00:27:23,733
Stopping atomic energy is
saving this country.

<i>In the 1980's, my husband and I were living
in the east end of Long Island.</i>

358
00:27:56,191 --> 00:28:01,858
<i>And, um, word gets out that
this nuclear plant is going to start-up.</i>

359
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:06,150
<i>And this is, of course,
right after Three Mile Island.</i>

360
00:28:06,191 --> 00:28:09,025
<i>That was very much in people's minds.</i>

361
00:28:10,441 --> 00:28:12,775
<i>The local-grown
environmental people...</i>

362
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:17,275
and I would be one of those,
ah, just said:

363
00:28:17,316 --> 00:28:19,733
"Yeah, we've gotta stop Shoreham,
however we can."

364
00:28:20,441 --> 00:28:23,150
- No nukes!
- No one will survive!

365
00:28:23,191 --> 00:28:25,150
Every day the plant operates

366
00:28:25,191 --> 00:28:27,983
radiation will be
coming out of the plant, right?

367
00:28:28,025 --> 00:28:29,650
And it will get into the food.

368
00:28:30,191 --> 00:28:33,608
<i>Women may be hard-wired
to protect our families.</i>

Stay clear of the bus.

370
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,275
<i>And it's just a natural impulse.</i>

371
00:28:37,316 --> 00:28:39,650
Stop the fraud!

372
00:28:39,691 --> 00:28:42,631
<i>If something looks like it's bad,</i>

373
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:49,150
we're holding up our hand and saying: "No,
no, pl... please, we... we can't have that."

374
00:28:57,983 --> 00:29:01,585
<i>I remember these
big scare ads in the papers.</i>

<i>Getting people to organize
rallies against Shoreham.</i>

376
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:12,233
<i>There were many things that I didn't know
at that time, that I've learned since.</i>

377
00:29:12,275 --> 00:29:17,191
<i>For one thing, it turns out, the ads were
placed by the oil delivery industry.</i>

378
00:29:17,233 --> 00:29:22,858
<i>You know, the companies that deliver
fuel to people on Long Island.</i>

379
00:29:23,483 --> 00:29:28,066
<i>And sure, the oil companies can say:
"Go solar!"</i>

380
00:29:28,108 --> 00:29:31,782
<i>Because they know that it's never going
to replace oil heat.</i>

381
00:29:32,263 --> 00:29:36,483
<i>You cannot turn on the sun in the winter
and hope to warm-up your house.</i>

382
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:38,025
<i>Good luck.</i>

383
00:29:38,941 --> 00:29:41,150
<i>- Solar, not nuclear.
- Solar, not nuclear.</i>

384
00:29:41,191 --> 00:29:44,233
- Sponsored by the Oil Heat Institute.
- Yeah. Yeah, no problem.

385
00:29:44,275 --> 00:29:47,900
Yeah, you don't need a furnace,
just have solar panels.

386
00:29:47,941 --> 00:29:51,775
I mean, this is the cynicism
of the fossil fuel industry.

387
00:29:54,275 --> 00:29:58,941
<i>Shoreham was actually finished
and started-up,</i>

388
00:29:58,983 --> 00:30:02,275
<i>when it immediately got shut-down
by the Governor of the State</i>

389
00:30:02,316 --> 00:30:05,066
<i>and basically, moth-balled.</i>

390
00:30:05,108 --> 00:30:08,191
It was this immense investment,
billions of Dollars,

391
00:30:08,233 --> 00:30:11,983
in a reactor that would have been
of great use to New York City.

392
00:30:12,025 --> 00:30:17,066
<i>But people were so afraid of it,
that they simply said:</i>

393
00:30:17,108 --> 00:30:19,066
<i>"Shut it down."</i>

394
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:22,525
<i>And, today it's a mausoleum.</i>

395
00:30:26,316 --> 00:30:29,983
<i>Those of us who were worried
about nuclear power,</i>

396
00:30:30,025 --> 00:30:34,733
<i>perceived that nuclear power
wasn't really needed.</i>

397
00:30:37,608 --> 00:30:43,983
<i>And this, I think, was one of the fundamental
tragedies of the anti-nuclear movement.</i>

398
00:30:44,025 --> 00:30:50,108
<i>To be anti-nuclear, is basically, to be
in favour of burning fossil fuels.</i>

399
00:30:52,983 --> 00:30:54,983
I had, finally, to change my mind.

400
00:30:55,025 --> 00:30:58,025
And, I have seen friends of mine
change their minds.

401
00:30:58,358 --> 00:31:00,316
<i>One of them being, Gwyneth Cravens,</i>

402
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:03,483
<i>who started out rather anti-nuclear,
as I did,</i>

403
00:31:03,525 --> 00:31:07,816
<i>and ended up writing a book
about the benefits of nuclear power.</i>

November 8, 1989
United Nations, New York

405
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:23,025
The difference now, is in the scale
of the damage we are doing.

406
00:31:23,358 --> 00:31:24,858
We are seeing a vast increase

407
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,983
in the amount of carbon dioxide
reaching the atmosphere.

408
00:31:29,441 --> 00:31:32,858
It is mankind, and his activities

409
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,733
which are changing the
the environment of our planet

410
00:31:35,775 --> 00:31:39,608
in damaging and dangerous ways.

411
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:41,900
Change to the sea around us.

412
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:44,858
Change to the atmosphere above.

413
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,983
Leading, in turn,
to change in the world's climate,

414
00:31:48,025 --> 00:31:52,983
which could alter the way we live, in the
most fundamental way of all.

415
00:31:53,275 --> 00:31:57,566
That prospect is a new factor
in human affairs.

416
00:31:57,608 --> 00:32:02,608
It's comparable in its implications,
to the discovery of how to split the atom.

417
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:06,900
Indeed its results,
could be even more far-reaching.

418
00:32:07,261 --> 00:32:11,298
We can't just do nothing.

419
00:32:24,483 --> 00:32:27,816
<i>One of the key arguments that the
climate-deniers use is:</i>

420
00:32:27,858 --> 00:32:29,733
<i>"Oh look, climate is a huge thing.</i>

421
00:32:29,775 --> 00:32:33,525
<i>"You mean were affecting the weather?
It's just us, we're just little people."</i>

422
00:32:33,566 --> 00:32:34,900
<i>But we are.</i>

00:32:48,882 --> 00:32:50,858
October, 2012

424
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:54,990
<i>We are beginning to see the kind of
destabilization and chaos that you get</i>

425
00:32:55,029 --> 00:32:59,066
<i>actually, when you see this transition to
much warmer global temperatures.</i>

HURRICANE SANDY

427
00:33:00,733 --> 00:33:03,900
<i>And that process of change,
very very rapid climate change</i>

428
00:33:03,941 --> 00:33:07,191
<i>is going to wreak havoc
on human society.</i>

429
00:33:35,358 --> 00:33:38,009
<i>Having children has made me
even more concerned about the future.</i>

430
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:42,525
<i>So, it's deep in my commitment
to tackling global warming.</i>

431
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,861
<i>Loving your children is about
loving the future</i>

432
00:33:48,863 --> 00:33:50,792
<i>and loving the world
that they're going to inherit.</i>

433
00:33:50,843 --> 00:33:54,657
<i>And so, you've got to make
sure that that's right.</i>

434
00:33:59,845 --> 00:34:03,483
You know, I had a sneaking suspicion that nuclear
was going to have to be part of the solution,

435
00:34:03,525 --> 00:34:07,941
simply because it doesn't produce
carbon dioxide.

436
00:34:08,233 --> 00:34:09,858
But, I didn't want to go there.

437
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,608
- Why?
- I was too scared.

438
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:16,400
I mean, it's pathetic really,
but, looking back, but you know, yeah,

439
00:34:16,441 --> 00:34:18,798
you don't want to make enemies

440
00:34:18,821 --> 00:34:20,887
of your main allies in
the environmental movement

441
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:25,066
by tackling something
which is difficult, controversial.

442
00:34:30,566 --> 00:34:33,720
<i>Ted and I spent basically the
entirety of our professional careers</i>

443
00:34:33,722 --> 00:34:35,941
<i>working for the
big environmental groups.</i>

444
00:34:36,233 --> 00:34:39,275
<i>I mean, you name it: Sierra Club, NRDC,</i>

445
00:34:39,316 --> 00:34:41,733
<i>even worked with Earth First
on a campaign to save</i>

446
00:34:41,775 --> 00:34:45,608
<i>the last ancient redwoods in California.</i>

447
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:51,441
<i>We were movement guys. I mean, we were
consultants to the big green groups.</i>

448
00:34:51,483 --> 00:34:56,066
<i>We really accepted most of the basic ideas
of the environmental movement,</i>

449
00:34:56,108 --> 00:35:00,150
and I think over time we,
you know, became gradually disillusioned

450
00:35:00,191 --> 00:35:04,025
with the traditional environmental
approaches to climate change.

451
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:08,535
It is my assessment that
we have no consensus here for Article 10.

452
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:11,668
Then, we are going to
delete Article 10 from the Protocol.

453
00:35:11,941 --> 00:35:13,108
It is so decided.

454
00:35:13,124 --> 00:35:14,308
THE KYOTO PROTOCOLS ASSEMBLY

455
00:35:14,331 --> 00:35:17,358
<i>People would tell you that:
"Oh, everything is going to change.</i>

456
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,858
<i>"The world is going to implement
the Kyoto Treaty on global warming.</i>

457
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:24,566
<i>"We're all going to start
using solar and wind for our energy."</i>

458
00:35:24,608 --> 00:35:26,358
<i>It was a very seductive narrative.</i>

459
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,691
Then, Part A is adopted.

460
00:35:30,733 --> 00:35:35,650
<i>There is agreement on
paragraph C of this article.</i>

461
00:35:35,691 --> 00:35:38,150
Paragraph C is adopted.

462
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:44,400
We understand that there is
agreement on Paragraphs D, E, F & G.

463
00:35:45,108 --> 00:35:48,243
<i>The idea was that the U.S. was
going to sign Kyoto</i>

464
00:35:48,298 --> 00:35:50,275
<i>and then all the countries in the world</i>

465
00:35:50,316 --> 00:35:53,400
<i>were just going to start
ratcheting-down their emissions year after year.</i>

466
00:35:53,441 --> 00:35:55,775
<i>Just like they did on their Excel spreadsheets.</i>

467
00:35:55,816 --> 00:35:57,784
<i>We continue with the revision of Part B.</i>

468
00:35:57,831 --> 00:36:00,733
<i>The problem is, these were
all proposals based on</i>

469
00:36:00,775 --> 00:36:02,983
<i>making fossil fuels more expensive.</i>

470
00:36:03,275 --> 00:36:07,441
<i>I think it's pretty safe to say,
that is not going to happen.</i>

471
00:36:07,483 --> 00:36:14,525
The adoption of this Protocol
to the conference is by unanimity.

472
00:36:14,566 --> 00:36:18,858
<i>There is not going to be a
global treaty on climate change.</i>

473
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:24,316
<i>The United Nations treaty process
is basically run aground.</i>

474
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:27,566
<i>We just walked away being like:</i>

475
00:36:27,608 --> 00:36:31,150
<i>"Nobody has a clue
as to how to do this."</i>

476
00:36:34,251 --> 00:36:37,025
So, we wrote this essay:
"Death of Environmentalism"

477
00:36:37,066 --> 00:36:41,150
that argued that, if environmentalism
is that kind of small bore,

478
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:44,816
<i>then we need something beyond
environmentalism.</i>

479
00:36:44,858 --> 00:36:48,150
Modern environmentalism, with all of its
unexamined assumptions,

480
00:36:48,191 --> 00:36:51,016
outdated concepts
and exhausted strategies

481
00:36:51,032 --> 00:36:52,565
must die,

482
00:36:52,582 --> 00:36:54,941
so that something new can live.

483
00:36:54,983 --> 00:36:59,150
I would suggest that it will take more
than dead penguins and melting ice caps

484
00:36:59,191 --> 00:37:01,664
to get Americans to
fundamentally get involved

485
00:37:01,703 --> 00:37:05,542
in its political transformation
of our energy economy.

486
00:37:06,108 --> 00:37:09,525
<i>We still didn't think we needed
nuclear power.</i>

487
00:37:09,566 --> 00:37:13,608
It really took us getting clear about
how big the gap was,

488
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:17,900
between fossil fuels and renewables
for us to take a second look at nuclear.

489
00:37:30,941 --> 00:37:35,650
<i>Part of the problem is intermittency.
And that hasn't been solved.</i>

490
00:37:35,691 --> 00:37:37,512
<i>It's not always sunny and it's
not always windy</i>

491
00:37:37,514 --> 00:37:38,829
<i>and there a long periods of time</i>

492
00:37:38,832 --> 00:37:41,374
<i>when renewables would deliver
no power at all into a grid.</i>

493
00:37:42,566 --> 00:37:45,608
<i>You have to have natural gas backup.</i>

494
00:37:49,941 --> 00:37:52,233
<i>So, what you end up getting with renewables</i>

495
00:37:52,275 --> 00:37:55,400
<i>is a pretty big expansion of natural gas.</i>

496
00:37:57,983 --> 00:38:02,691
<i>You know, I'm sure people had told me that
and I didn't believe them.</i>

497
00:38:04,441 --> 00:38:07,673
<i>We're building these all over the country
and one of the questions we ask,</i>

498
00:38:07,689 --> 00:38:10,483
<i>we need about 3,000 foot in altitude,</i>

499
00:38:10,525 --> 00:38:13,814
<i>we need flat land,
we need 300 days of sunlight</i>

500
00:38:13,837 --> 00:38:15,983
<i>and we need to be near a gas plant.</i>

501
00:38:16,025 --> 00:38:20,483
Because, you know, for all of these
big utility scale power plants,

502
00:38:20,775 --> 00:38:22,566
whether it's wind or solar,

503
00:38:22,608 --> 00:38:26,941
everybody is looking at gas as the
supplementary fuel.

504
00:38:26,983 --> 00:38:30,983
The plants that we are building, the wind
plants and the solar plants are gas plants.

505
00:38:36,775 --> 00:38:39,900
<i>I end up feeling like a sucker.</i>

506
00:38:39,941 --> 00:38:43,400
<i>I... I ended up feeling like
I was a sucker.</i>

507
00:38:46,941 --> 00:38:51,858
<i>The idea that we're gonna replace
oil and coal and natural gas</i>

508
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:58,858
<i>with solar and wind and nothing else
is an hallucinatory delusion.</i>

509
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,316
You know, you find yourself feeling...

510
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:10,108
I found myself quite
disappointed in myself and...

511
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:14,608
and honestly, quite angry at others
who were propagating that myth.

512
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:18,075
This light bulb, when everybody's got them,
will quadruple the efficiency of bulbs

513
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,908
and that will displace
two dozen power plants.

514
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:25,066
This thing for florescent lights
will displace 60 big power plants.

515
00:39:25,108 --> 00:39:28,650
This motor controller chip
and about 10 other things you do to motors

516
00:39:28,691 --> 00:39:30,025
will save 70 big power plants.

517
00:39:30,066 --> 00:39:33,816
Just these 3 things:
there goes every nuclear plant we have.

518
00:39:33,858 --> 00:39:37,608
<i>I had gotten the religion about
energy efficiency and renewables</i>

519
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:40,358
<i>in college,
when I first read Amory Lovins.</i>

520
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,722
<i>Amory Lovins is still taught</i>

521
00:39:41,761 --> 00:39:46,275
<i>in maybe every liberal arts
environmental states class in America.</i>

522
00:39:46,316 --> 00:39:47,983
In his article after article,

523
00:39:48,025 --> 00:39:51,316
explaining why solar and wind are
cheaper than fossil fuels

524
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:53,800
and why you don't need to
build nuclear plants

525
00:39:53,862 --> 00:39:56,400
because we can use energy efficiency...

526
00:39:56,441 --> 00:40:00,775
<i>It's a very appealing, seductive message.</i>

527
00:40:00,816 --> 00:40:04,316
Ah, they're getting smaller, here's
a little Osram 11, replacing a 50.

528
00:40:04,358 --> 00:40:07,858
<i>And I bought it,
my parents and my family bought it,</i>

529
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,108
<i>really, everybody I know believed this.</i>

530
00:40:16,025 --> 00:40:18,501
The standards of green
environmentalist narrative

531
00:40:18,556 --> 00:40:21,407
has been that we can all use less energy;

532
00:40:21,446 --> 00:40:25,608
so we can be renewable,
we can go for energy efficiency.

533
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:29,900
The idea that humankind is simply wasting
and using too much.

534
00:40:30,941 --> 00:40:33,483
<i>Now, I have a lot of
time for that argument.</i>

535
00:40:33,525 --> 00:40:36,358
<i>But you can't keep using
less energy forever.</i>

536
00:40:47,608 --> 00:40:48,983
<i>Most people kind of think</i>

537
00:40:49,025 --> 00:40:53,816
<i>that, somehow we're going to be reducing
our energy consumption.</i>

538
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:57,149
<i>Actually, we just find more and more
uses for it.</i>

539
00:40:59,066 --> 00:41:03,025
<i>If you look at all the energy
that is used by an iPhone,</i>

540
00:41:03,066 --> 00:41:05,025
<i>not just to make it
and to power it,</i>

541
00:41:05,066 --> 00:41:09,066
<i>but also to power all the servers,
all of the stuff you don't see,</i>

542
00:41:09,108 --> 00:41:14,483
<i>that the iPhone is connected to:
it uses as much energy as a refrigerator.</i>

543
00:41:24,566 --> 00:41:26,150
<i>There is a direct correlation</i>

544
00:41:26,191 --> 00:41:31,816
<i>between the amount of energy
available to a civilization</i>

545
00:41:31,858 --> 00:41:35,525
<i>and that civilization's quality of life.</i>

546
00:41:37,316 --> 00:41:41,358
Unless you want to condemn
more than half the population of the Earth

547
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,525
to poverty and sickness
and short lives.

548
00:41:45,566 --> 00:41:47,733
We're going to have
to produce more energy.

549
00:41:49,775 --> 00:41:53,608
<i>In regions that don't have electricity,
or very little electricity,</i>

550
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:55,858
<i>the life span is much shorter.</i>

551
00:41:55,900 --> 00:42:02,191
<i>Clinics, schools, refrigeration,
all of these things rely on electricity.</i>

552
00:42:02,233 --> 00:42:05,275
<i>And just a few watts make
a big difference.</i>

553
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:11,316
<i>As soon as you get electricity,
you improve people's lives.</i>

554
00:42:12,858 --> 00:42:13,983
<i>Well, that's human life.</i>

555
00:42:14,025 --> 00:42:18,358
First of all, we're talking
about human, just quality of life.

556
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,483
And if you look at the countries
with the best quality of life,

557
00:42:22,275 --> 00:42:26,233
<i>they are the countries
that consume the most electricity.</i>

558
00:42:27,233 --> 00:42:32,941
<i>Rain or shine, 24 hours a day,
a steady stream of power.</i>

559
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:46,691
<i>The global south is pretty warm, they would
like air conditioning.</i>

560
00:42:47,275 --> 00:42:51,483
<i>And, up till now, they've not been
able to afford it. But now they can.</i>

561
00:42:53,983 --> 00:42:56,066
<i>They're getting out of poverty</i>

562
00:42:56,858 --> 00:43:01,441
<i>and they need grid electricity to
run their air conditioners.</i>

563
00:43:04,066 --> 00:43:08,608
<i>Of course, various environmentalists
freak out at that point.</i>

564
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:10,650
<i>But, on the other hand,</i>

565
00:43:10,691 --> 00:43:16,316
if you could have vast quantities
of really, really clean energy,

566
00:43:16,358 --> 00:43:20,775
in the developing world
in the next decade or so.

567
00:43:20,816 --> 00:43:23,566
That is such an improved world,
it takes your breath away.

568
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:32,983
<i>Assuming that the world
continues to develop,</i>

569
00:43:33,025 --> 00:43:36,858
<i>and that China and India and Brazil
become rich countries,</i>

570
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:39,066
over the next half-century
or century,

571
00:43:39,108 --> 00:43:41,275
how much energy
is the world gonna use?

572
00:43:44,483 --> 00:43:49,983
<i>When you start running
those numbers, it's a sobering exercise.</i>

573
00:43:53,608 --> 00:43:56,204
<i>And you may not be able
to get that number exactly right,</i>

574
00:43:56,208 --> 00:44:00,525
<i>but you realize that we're gonna basically double
the amount of energy we consume by 2050.</i>

575
00:44:00,566 --> 00:44:04,691
<i>We're probably going to triple it
or quadruple it by the end of the century.</i>

576
00:44:04,733 --> 00:44:10,400
<i>And meanwhile, if you want to stabilize
emissions at some reasonable level,</i>

577
00:44:10,441 --> 00:44:13,233
<i>almost all of that energy
has to be clean energy.</i>

578
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:16,983
<i>You know you've got only, you know, create
a clean energy infrastructure</i>

579
00:44:17,025 --> 00:44:19,900
<i>to replace the fossil fuel infrastructure
we have,</i>

580
00:44:19,941 --> 00:44:23,108
<i>but we have to create
yet another one, or maybe two of 'em</i>

581
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:25,775
<i>between now and 2050 or 2100;</i>

582
00:44:25,816 --> 00:44:29,983
<i>in order to reduce our emissions,
to stabilize the climate.</i>

583
00:44:30,441 --> 00:44:35,556
<i>And, that is just nothing that anybody
has really been talking about</i>

584
00:44:35,626 --> 00:44:38,816
<i>or dealing with
over the last 20 years.</i>

585
00:44:52,025 --> 00:44:55,358
<i>It comes as a shock
to a lot of environmentalists to hear this,</i>

586
00:44:55,400 --> 00:45:00,691
<i>but coal is not only the most
widely-used source of energy in the world,</i>

587
00:45:01,014 --> 00:45:03,900
<i>it's also the fastest growing
source of energy.</i>

588
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:10,025
<i>It's use is accelerating world-wide...
faster than natural gas,</i>

589
00:45:10,066 --> 00:45:13,983
<i>faster than renewables,
faster than anything else.</i>

590
00:45:24,108 --> 00:45:29,858
When I have spoken to women's groups,
none of them knew how bad coal was.

591
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:31,525
They didn't know it killed people.

592
00:45:33,733 --> 00:45:37,941
<i>If you add up all fossil fuel combustion
in the United States,</i>

593
00:45:37,983 --> 00:45:39,566
<i>just from power plants,</i>

594
00:45:39,608 --> 00:45:43,983
<i>the fine particulates alone,
kill 13,000 people a year.</i>

595
00:45:46,525 --> 00:45:52,691
<i>World wide, 3 million people die a year,
from air pollution from fossil fuel plants.</i>

596
00:45:56,711 --> 00:46:01,733
<i>One of the big surprises for me, when I
started looking into the mortality data:</i>

597
00:46:01,775 --> 00:46:05,275
<i>the death rates associated with each
energy technology</i>

598
00:46:05,316 --> 00:46:07,941
<i>per, the amount of energy they make,</i>

599
00:46:07,983 --> 00:46:11,900
<i>is that nuclear is the second-safest
after wind.</i>

600
00:46:13,525 --> 00:46:16,275
<i>And in fact,
to add to the irony of it,</i>

601
00:46:16,316 --> 00:46:19,858
<i>nuclear power is even safer than
solar panels.</i>

602
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:23,900
<i>Making solar panels is
an incredibly toxic process.</i>

603
00:46:27,941 --> 00:46:30,691
<i>But, I thought people died
at Three Mile Island.</i>

604
00:46:30,733 --> 00:46:34,983
<i>I thought that hundreds of thousands
of people died at Chernobyl.</i>

605
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:38,483
<i>I thought that there was nuclear waste
scattered all around the country</i>

606
00:46:38,525 --> 00:46:42,450
<i>and that it was seeping into
our water systems.</i>

607
00:46:42,941 --> 00:46:47,191
I believed all that stuff and I... and I thought,
even if maybe it was getting a little bit better,

608
00:46:47,233 --> 00:46:50,126
or maybe if the problems with it
were exaggerated,

609
00:46:50,157 --> 00:46:52,775
a little bit by my
fellow environmentalists,

610
00:46:52,816 --> 00:46:57,150
that it was still a risk
that we didn't need to take.

611
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,858
<i>There hasn't been a single death</i>

612
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:16,900
<i>from the operation of commercial
nuclear reactors in the United States.</i>

613
00:47:16,941 --> 00:47:21,248
<i>Not one death in the history
of nuclear power in this country.</i>

614
00:47:23,741 --> 00:47:27,608
<i>At Vermont Yankee, which anti-nuclear
people are trying to shut down,</i>

615
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:31,453
<i>protesters keep saying,
it's causing public health problems.</i>

616
00:47:32,458 --> 00:47:36,203
<i>- It's not.</i>
- But it's leaking tritium.

617
00:47:37,483 --> 00:47:39,790
It's leaking tritium, that's true.

618
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,025
- Banana break?
- Oh, I'd love one.

619
00:47:42,066 --> 00:47:43,650
- Sure.
- Thank you.

620
00:47:43,691 --> 00:47:46,662
<i>- If you ate one banana...</i>
- Banana Breaks?

621
00:47:46,701 --> 00:47:50,150
<i>which have a potassium isotope
that's a little hot,</i>

622
00:47:50,191 --> 00:47:52,821
<i>you would get more radiation exposure</i>

623
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:59,150
<i>than you would if you drank all the water
that comes out of the plant in one day.</i>

624
00:47:59,191 --> 00:48:01,441
Banana Break!

625
00:48:01,483 --> 00:48:05,650
<i>Tritium is a naturally
occurring hydrogen isotope.</i>

626
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:10,858
I'm going to ask that all those people
who are willing to risk arrest

627
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:17,858
remain in this safety zone,
until the rest of the people have moved...

628
00:48:21,108 --> 00:48:23,983
Vermont, 2012

629
00:48:25,733 --> 00:48:30,025
<i>In New Mexico, where I grew up,
there's Radium Springs.</i>

630
00:48:30,066 --> 00:48:34,983
<i>And, um, I had a friend who went
with his Geiger counter,</i>

631
00:48:35,025 --> 00:48:37,858
<i>and these hippies were there
soaking in the baths</i>

632
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:42,358
<i>and he got out his Geiger counter and said,
"You know, this is radioactive."</i>

633
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,483
and they said,
"Yeah man, but it's natural."

634
00:48:51,275 --> 00:48:55,025
<i>It is true to say that we are
all bathed in natural radioactivity.</i>

635
00:48:56,691 --> 00:48:59,900
<i>It's affecting all of us all the time.</i>

636
00:48:59,941 --> 00:49:03,275
<i>It comes from the rocks and the air,
and even from space.</i>

637
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:07,358
<i>It's in our food and our water
and in our teeth.</i>

638
00:49:08,316 --> 00:49:11,816
<i>So, radiation isn't dangerous
in an everyday sense.</i>

639
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:16,108
<i>And there's enormous variation in
different parts of the world.</i>

640
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:19,316
Do you have any numbers
just to put that in a kind of a context?

641
00:49:19,358 --> 00:49:22,983
Well the numbers, I mean the units are difficult:
it's grays and millirems and all this kind of thing...

642
00:49:23,025 --> 00:49:24,530
Right.

643
00:49:25,885 --> 00:49:29,718
<i>You know, so the numbers are not familiar
to people in any way, shape, or form.</i>

644
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:34,445
<i>If I say to you: "The radioactivity:
Oh, it's only another 4 microsieverts."</i>

645
00:49:34,447 --> 00:49:38,079
<i>Are you going to feel better about that? Of course you're
not, because you don't know what on Earth I'm talking about.</i>

646
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:39,983
Iodine 131.

647
00:49:40,622 --> 00:49:45,905
<i>They were reporting those radiation levels, and
it was as confusing as they could possibly be.</i>

648
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:50,514
<i>...has just about zero point seven rem...</i>

649
00:49:50,566 --> 00:49:52,983
You have to get up to 50 to 75 rem
to get to...

650
00:49:53,025 --> 00:49:55,983
<i>We hear about rems,
and millirems and microrems</i>

651
00:49:56,025 --> 00:49:57,914
<i>and then, oh now there's sieverts.</i>

652
00:49:57,961 --> 00:50:01,953
<i>We hear a lot about sieverts,
microsieverts, millisieverts.</i>

653
00:50:02,632 --> 00:50:06,233
And you're looking and squinting,
and okay, that looks like large numbers.

654
00:50:06,275 --> 00:50:09,108
Is that a number I should worry about?
And compared to what?

655
00:50:10,608 --> 00:50:15,650
<i>What's the background radiation level
relative to all this?</i>

656
00:50:15,691 --> 00:50:18,900
LOS ANGELES
0.09 microsieverts per hour

657
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:20,718
LONDON
0.10 microsieverts per hour

658
00:50:20,741 --> 00:50:24,233
<i>I didn't even know that there was such a thing
as natural background radiation, actually.</i>

659
00:50:24,275 --> 00:50:26,858
<i>I had assumed that radiation was
something which humans</i>

660
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:29,983
<i>had artificially introduced into the environment;
which was doing us harm.</i>

661
00:50:31,358 --> 00:50:32,600
NEW YORK
0.13 microsieverts per hour

662
00:50:32,608 --> 00:50:35,693
<i>There's background radioactivity
affecting all of us, all the time,</i>

663
00:50:35,717 --> 00:50:39,717
<i>which is many many times
more powerful than artificial radioactivity</i>

664
00:50:39,748 --> 00:50:42,025
<i>in terms of how we are affected.</i>

665
00:50:42,066 --> 00:50:43,717
TOKYO
0.14 microsieverts per hour

666
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:47,358
<i>So, zero tolerance of radiation
doesn't make any sense.</i>

667
00:50:53,608 --> 00:50:56,150
<i>Radiation increases with altitude.</i>

668
00:50:56,191 --> 00:50:57,441
NEW HAMPSHIRE
0.30 microsieverts per hour

669
00:50:57,483 --> 00:50:59,920
<i>People who live at a higher altitude
get a higher dose</i>

670
00:50:59,951 --> 00:51:02,967
than people who live in low-lying areas.

671
00:51:02,971 --> 00:51:04,037
ON THE PACIFIC OCEAN
2.20 microsieverts per hour

672
00:51:04,053 --> 00:51:08,316
<i>And, if you are travelling on an aeroplane,
say, you're going from New York to Tokyo,</i>

673
00:51:08,358 --> 00:51:12,983
<i>you will get 20 times the average
background level during that flight.</i>

674
00:51:15,816 --> 00:51:18,858
<i>For example,
in Guarapari Beach, in Brazil,</i>

675
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:22,400
<i>the natural background radiation is
way above permitted levels</i>

676
00:51:22,441 --> 00:51:24,900
<i>in terms of what the
public can be exposed to.</i>

677
00:51:24,941 --> 00:51:26,150
GUARAPARI BRAZIL
30.81 microsieverts per hour

678
00:51:26,191 --> 00:51:28,671
<i>And that's what is coming out of
the soil that's on the beach.</i>

679
00:51:30,066 --> 00:51:31,941
Can you ask him why he does this?

680
00:51:37,566 --> 00:51:41,316
Eh, he has, ah, body pains, you know?

681
00:51:41,983 --> 00:51:43,400
And this helps?

682
00:51:43,441 --> 00:51:46,316
Ele ajuda. Ajuda. Ajuda.

683
00:51:46,331 --> 00:51:47,540
<i>It helps.</i>

684
00:51:51,816 --> 00:51:54,983
<i>And, what's really striking,
is that there is no correlation</i>

685
00:51:55,025 --> 00:51:56,603
<i>between background levels of radioactivity</i>

686
00:51:56,623 --> 00:52:01,248
<i>which vary by such enormous amounts
and high levels of cancer.</i>

687
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:08,983
<i>Cancer is something which is the greatest
fear of most people in rich countries.</i>

688
00:52:09,189 --> 00:52:13,147
<i>And, because it kills 20%
of people anyway.</i>

689
00:52:14,108 --> 00:52:16,566
<i>We all know people who've died of cancer...</i>

690
00:52:16,608 --> 00:52:19,608
and so this idea that radioactivity
is a cause of cancer

691
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:23,941
is probably the number one reason
why people are scared of it.

EXCLUSION ZONE
Chernobyl, Ukraine

693
00:52:39,941 --> 00:52:41,557
<i>You can't go to Chernobyl</i>

694
00:52:41,559 --> 00:52:45,400
<i>and not re-examine your core beliefs
about nuclear power.</i>

695
00:52:47,275 --> 00:52:51,150
<i>I mean, you would have to be
really thick-headed.</i>

696
00:52:51,191 --> 00:52:54,733
<i>Not... not to look at that
and the damage that was done and say:</i>

<i>"Alright, when it goes wrong...</i>

<i>"but when it goes wrong:
it can go really very wrong indeed."</i>

700
00:53:07,066 --> 00:53:09,608
<i>Chernobyl was a...
a real-world experiment</i>

701
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:13,275
<i>of what happens when you irradiate
a very large population.</i>

702
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:17,941
<i>But, 1986 was a long time ago.</i>

703
00:53:17,983 --> 00:53:20,128
<i>So, we've gotten the perspective
and the distance</i>

704
00:53:20,198 --> 00:53:23,240
<i>to be able to assess
what the real impacts of that were.</i>

705
00:53:25,135 --> 00:53:28,525

<i>The reactor that exploded in Chernobyl
in April, 1986,</i>

709
00:53:40,858 --> 00:53:45,108
<i>was actually number 4, reactor number 4
of a whole set of them.</i>

710
00:53:46,025 --> 00:53:48,360
<i>No one really realizes it,
the 3 other units</i>

711

<i>which are in the same building,
carried-on operating and generating</i>

712

<i>electricity, right up until the mid-'90s.</i>

713

CHERNOBYL REACTOR Unit One

714
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:58,775
<i>And people just
went to work there every day.</i>

715
00:53:59,108 --> 00:54:01,066
<i>Isn't that amazing?</i>

716
00:54:04,233 --> 00:54:06,400
<i>Outside of the old Soviet Union,</i>

717
00:54:06,441 --> 00:54:10,983
<i>we didn't use the reactor design
that Chernobyl had.</i>

718
00:54:11,025 --> 00:54:17,316
<i>Among other things, the Chernobyl reactor
had no containment building.</i>

719

<i>It was in, virtually a quonset hut.</i>

720
00:54:22,941 --> 00:54:26,191
So, when there was a fire and an explosion,

721
00:54:26,233 --> 00:54:28,900
there was nothing to contain it.

722
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:37,025
<i>Chernobyl was a different kind of reactor.
It was inherently unsafe.</i>

<i>It was primarily designed to make
plutonium for bombs.</i>

724
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:45,775
<i>No Chernobyl-style reactors were
ever built in the West.</i>

725
00:54:47,478 --> 00:54:50,439
But, if you could then point to
other nuclear power stations and say:

726
00:54:50,478 --> 00:54:52,376
"Each of those could be a Chernobyl..."

727
00:54:52,423 --> 00:54:55,941
then, you've got a pretty powerful argument
against nuclear power.

728
00:55:00,983 --> 00:55:03,275
<i>The city nearby, called Pripyat,</i>

729
00:55:03,316 --> 00:55:07,025
<i>the entire place was evacuated
when Chernobyl blew up.</i>

730
00:55:08,233 --> 00:55:11,370
<i>It's just fascinating to see
some place which is frozen in time</i>

731
00:55:11,425 --> 00:55:14,592
<i>at the very end of the era
of the Soviet Union.</i>

732
00:55:16,525 --> 00:55:19,983
<i>It's an extraordinary place.
I really can't even describe it.</i>

733
00:55:23,108 --> 00:55:26,358
<i>It's a bit like the Fukushima thing,
in the sense that</i>

734
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:31,233
<i>you're tramping around on this, debris
of broken glass and broken everything;</i>

735
00:55:31,275 --> 00:55:35,566
<i>and it's almost as if the explosion
at Chernobyl had somehow caused this.</i>

736
00:55:37,358 --> 00:55:41,525
<i>Of course it didn't, it's just the decay
of time and things have been broken.</i>

737
00:55:47,983 --> 00:55:52,316
<i>Obviously, what people are concerned about
at Chernobyl is the radioactivity.</i>

738
00:55:58,441 --> 00:56:02,941
<i>I never knew, until I went to Chernobyl,
that there were places full of people</i>

739
00:56:03,275 --> 00:56:05,941
<i>that just decided to
ignore the restrictions</i>

740
00:56:05,983 --> 00:56:08,608
<i>and they just moved back to their houses.</i>

741
00:56:08,941 --> 00:56:11,733
<i>And, you can go to this old
church and you can meet them.</i>

742
00:56:20,757 --> 00:56:24,401
PRIPYAT, UKRAINE
0.20 microsieverts per hour

743
00:56:28,858 --> 00:56:32,525
Just ask him when and why did
he decide to come back

744
00:56:32,566 --> 00:56:35,941
and um, how many... how many people
came with him?

745
00:56:45,673 --> 00:56:50,025
This is our Chernobyl.

746
00:56:50,066 --> 00:56:54,400
It is where we have always lived.

747
00:56:54,441 --> 00:56:57,525
<i>Nobody wanted to leave here.</i>

748
00:56:57,566 --> 00:57:00,483
<i>By the spring of 1987,
people were already beginning to return.</i>

749
00:57:00,525 --> 00:57:04,487
<i>Of course, nobody let us come back,
we just came through the woods on our own.</i>

750
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:10,597
<i>People returned to their homes a few at a
time. They just came back and re-settled.</i>

751
00:57:10,612 --> 00:57:14,275
I have lived here in
Chernobyl for 25 years.

752
00:57:14,316 --> 00:57:16,233
And I'm perfectly healthy.

753
00:57:16,275 --> 00:57:19,608
<i>Among those who have returned,</i>

754
00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:25,977
<i>no one has died of cancer
or any other disease.</i>

755
00:57:27,504 --> 00:57:30,775
OUTSIDE CHERNOBYL REACTOR BUILDING
3.74 microsieverts per hour

756
00:57:31,066 --> 00:57:35,858
<i>The explosion of the reactor at Chernobyl
had enormous consequences.</i>

757
00:57:36,983 --> 00:57:40,733
But not the ones, I think,
many people expect.

758
00:57:44,525 --> 00:57:48,525
<i>I've followed the studies that have been
done by the international experts</i>

759
00:57:48,566 --> 00:57:50,816
<i>in radiation and oncology</i>

760
00:57:50,858 --> 00:57:55,400
<i>that followed the damage at Chernobyl
for all the years since.</i>

761
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:03,525
<i>The damage that was
caused to people by the fallout</i>

762
00:58:03,566 --> 00:58:06,900
<i>from that worst-of-all
nuclear power accidents</i>

763
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:09,775
<i>has been remarkably limited.</i>

764
00:58:13,233 --> 00:58:15,603
<i>You can look at the evidence,
it's all been published.</i>

765
00:58:15,642 --> 00:58:19,720
<i>It's been certified by the United Nations
and the World Health Organization.</i>

766
00:58:25,608 --> 00:58:29,660
<i>What's so striking is just to go read the
original World Health Organization documents</i>

767
00:58:30,546 --> 00:58:33,007
<i>then read the public health reports.</i>

768
00:58:33,875 --> 00:58:36,794
- Was that a shock to you?
- It was a complete shock to me.

769
00:58:36,796 --> 00:58:39,821
I mean I... there was a period when I'm
reading all the Chernobyl stuff,

770
00:58:39,823 --> 00:58:42,650
and I... I, I kind of am not believing it.

771
00:58:42,691 --> 00:58:47,566
Because, it was so out of sync
with what I had come to believe.

772
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:55,228
<i>Literally hundreds of thousands of people
were involved in the clear-off operation.</i>

773
00:58:55,267 --> 00:59:00,689
<i>They're known as liquidators. And they got
some really significant doses of radiation.</i>

774
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:05,191
<i>Their doses are known and their
health has been studied ever since.</i>

775
00:59:05,566 --> 00:59:10,858
<i>And even in that large number of people
who were very heavily irradiated</i>

776
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:13,066
<i>40 or 50 people have died so far</i>

777
00:59:13,108 --> 00:59:18,400
<i>and a few thousand may have shortened life
spans due to cancer in future decades.</i>

778
00:59:20,450 --> 00:59:24,358
<i>And there have never been any children
born deformed from Chernobyl,</i>

779
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:28,233
<i>according to the best authoritative science
we've got from the United Nations.</i>

780
00:59:32,375 --> 00:59:37,328
So, people have substantially been fed

781
00:59:37,352 --> 00:59:40,539
an urban myth, really, about what the impacts
of Chernobyl actually were.

782
00:59:40,586 --> 00:59:42,608
I mean I've got books full of it.

783
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:47,150
A million people dying right now, or
have died because of Chernobyl

784
00:59:47,191 --> 00:59:48,900
and it was only 25 years ago.

785
00:59:48,941 --> 00:59:51,691
How many millions more
will Chernobyl kill?

786
00:59:51,733 --> 00:59:55,066
40% of the European landmass
is radioactive.

787
00:59:55,108 --> 00:59:57,084
It will be for hundreds of years...

788
00:59:57,131 --> 01:00:01,733
<i>In order to believe that more than
56 people were killed at Chernobyl,</i>

789
01:00:01,775 --> 01:00:05,358
or more than the maybe 4,000 who would
eventually die of cancer;

790
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:09,233
in order to believe that a million people
were killed by Chernobyl

791
01:00:09,275 --> 01:00:13,525
which is what Greenpeace and Helen Caldicott
and a number of other people claim,

792
01:00:13,566 --> 01:00:18,691
you have to believe there was a cover-up
of just massive proportions

793
01:00:18,733 --> 01:00:21,733
by the World Health Organization,
by the United Nations,

794
01:00:21,775 --> 01:00:25,941
by literally hundreds of the world's
top public health experts.

795
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:29,483
<i>It's so absurd of an idea.</i>

796
01:00:29,525 --> 01:00:33,275
<i>And it is exactly the same thing
global warming deniers think.</i>

797
01:00:35,525 --> 01:00:38,608
Helen, what do you think is
the motivation for the United Nations,

798
01:00:38,650 --> 01:00:41,650
to perpetuate
such an appalling cover-up?

799
01:00:44,264 --> 01:00:48,316
I don't know,
I'm not... privy to their motivations.

800
01:00:48,358 --> 01:00:52,775
But the difference between 50 people
and a million people is so extreme.

801
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:55,775
I think people are confused
about what to think.

802
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:59,316
Well, they should
look at the literature.

803
01:00:59,358 --> 01:01:02,775
This is the most important study, almost,
that's ever been done.

804
01:01:02,816 --> 01:01:03,983
How do you explain it?

805
01:01:04,025 --> 01:01:06,900
This is the biggest cover-up in
the history of medicine.

806
01:01:06,941 --> 01:01:09,525
<i>Many of the tactics and the arguments</i>

807
01:01:09,566 --> 01:01:13,108
<i>that have been used by the environmental
groups against nuclear power</i>

808
01:01:13,150 --> 01:01:16,733
are exactly the same tactics and arguments
that are used by climate sceptics.

809
01:01:16,775 --> 01:01:19,025
The United Nations,
that's where all of this started.

810
01:01:19,066 --> 01:01:21,128
Senator James Inhofe R-Oklahoma

811
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:23,858
It was the IPCC in the United Nations, said
that the world was going to come to an end

812
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:26,158
<i>because of the emissions of CO2.</i>

813
01:01:26,790 --> 01:01:32,035
<i>So, the cherry-picking of scientific data,
the nurturing of... of scientists</i>

814
01:01:32,037 --> 01:01:34,795
<i>who happen to believe
your ideological position</i>

815
01:01:34,834 --> 01:01:38,941
<i>and the production of reports which
apparently are authoritative and scientific</i>

816
01:01:38,983 --> 01:01:42,025
<i>but actually are
ideological propaganda, basically</i>

817
01:01:42,066 --> 01:01:45,941
41% of the people believe that
global warming claims are exaggerated

818
01:01:45,983 --> 01:01:48,025
Climate change deniers are idiots.

819
01:01:48,066 --> 01:01:49,733
- But they're saying the same thing.
- I don't care about them.

820
01:01:49,775 --> 01:01:52,558
They, they are denying science.

821
01:01:52,566 --> 01:01:55,436
- We're going back into the Dark Ages.
- But they're saying the same thing.

822
01:01:55,467 --> 01:01:58,323
How dare...
how dare they deny science?

823
01:01:58,325 --> 01:02:01,444
Not to understand science
and medicine in this day and age

824
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:03,158
is more than irresponsible.

825
01:02:03,172 --> 01:02:06,110
- How do you square these two conflicts?
- I can't.

826
01:02:08,450 --> 01:02:12,775
<i>You know, we think of Japan,
we think of Hiroshima, those pictures,</i>

827
01:02:12,816 --> 01:02:14,620
<i>horrible after the event that happened...</i>

828
01:02:14,628 --> 01:02:16,025
No radiation is safe.

829
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:19,171
But, generally speaking, Americans don't
have anything to worry about.

830
01:02:19,173 --> 01:02:23,520
We have this map here, and we're showing
obviously, the path of 5,000 miles.

831
01:02:23,522 --> 01:02:25,142
First to the Aleution Islands,
this is where they expect...

832
01:02:25,573 --> 01:02:29,108
<i>You can't reassure people. People are
so terrified that anything you say,</i>

833
01:02:29,110 --> 01:02:31,843
<i>because they don't
have that background context,</i>

834
01:02:31,845 --> 01:02:34,222
<i>that understanding of what radiation is
and what it means,</i>

835
01:02:34,224 --> 01:02:36,649
<i>they can't actually
decide for themselves what's safe</i>

836
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:38,239
<i>and what risk they want to bear.</i>

837
01:02:38,830 --> 01:02:41,045
REFUGEE HOUSING
Fukushima Prefecture

838
01:02:41,067 --> 01:02:43,307
<i>And I think that's one of
the real problems at Fukushima.</i>

839
01:02:46,733 --> 01:02:48,858
<i>There's no way for the experts</i>

840
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:52,066
<i>to actually communicate what s safe
to the general public.</i>

841
01:02:52,641 --> 01:02:54,401
FUKUSHIMA HOUSING
0.18 microsieverts per hour

842
01:02:55,534 --> 01:02:58,855
I don't let my children play outside
for very long.

843
01:02:58,878 --> 01:03:03,358
At most, one or two hours, not more.

844
01:03:07,691 --> 01:03:11,066
<i>If you are exposed to the
fallout from Fukushima</i>

845
01:03:11,108 --> 01:03:14,691
<i>and according to the World Health
Organization and the U.N. generally,</i>

846
01:03:14,733 --> 01:03:18,644
<i>the increased risk of getting cancer
is estimated to be</i>

847
01:03:18,698 --> 01:03:22,675
<i>so infinitesimally small,
given the large population,</i>

848
01:03:22,706 --> 01:03:26,900
<i>that you will never be able
to identify this impact epidemiologically.</i>

849
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:35,941
I just won the bet.

850
01:03:36,186 --> 01:03:42,108
This particular weed here is more
radioactive than Guarapari Beach in Brazil.

851
01:03:42,941 --> 01:03:46,069
So we got, what did we get, 44?

852
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:51,983
<i>Now we've seen what
the worst is that can happen</i>

853
01:03:52,025 --> 01:03:55,108
<i>with a 1960's era Western design reactor,</i>

854
01:03:55,150 --> 01:03:59,441
<i>which does have a containment
structure, which Chernobyl didn't.</i>

855
01:04:01,025 --> 01:04:04,483
<i>But, this isn't something you can
just brush away.</i>

856
01:04:04,941 --> 01:04:07,983
<i>This was not supposed to happen
to a reactor.</i>

857
01:04:26,608 --> 01:04:31,900
IDAHO, U.S.A.

858
01:04:34,650 --> 01:04:40,983
<i>Back in the '80s, it was clear to me
that something had to be done.</i>

859
01:04:42,066 --> 01:04:45,150
<i>Something better than
present day,</i>

860
01:04:45,203 --> 01:04:47,161
<i>about safety.</i>

861
01:04:49,358 --> 01:04:51,831
<i>And, it wasn't only in safety.</i>

862
01:04:51,870 --> 01:04:54,358
It was in matters
of waste as well

863
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:58,792
and in proliferation matters.

864
01:04:58,816 --> 01:05:02,623
And over all of those things,
the matter of economics.

865
01:05:02,654 --> 01:05:06,691
You can't make the plant impossibly
expensive by making it too complicated.

866
01:05:06,725 --> 01:05:09,642
Go ahead and go up to the
main parking lot there, Mac.

867
01:05:09,691 --> 01:05:11,566
All right, thanks very much.

868
01:05:11,608 --> 01:05:17,775
<i>So, in 1980, I was given the job of
directing the entire program</i>

869
01:05:17,816 --> 01:05:22,316
<i>of advanced reactor development
at Argonne National Laboratory.</i>

870
01:05:23,608 --> 01:05:27,525
<i>Our goal was to design a
new type of reactor.</i>

871
01:05:27,566 --> 01:05:30,858
<i>Where the very physics of it
would be such</i>

872
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:34,337
<i>that it could withstand
almost any type of accident</i>

873
01:05:34,368 --> 01:05:38,441
<i>that nuclear plants can be subject to.</i>

874
01:05:38,483 --> 01:05:40,400
EBR-II
CENTRAL REACTOR

875
01:05:40,441 --> 01:05:44,483
<i>It was called the IFR.
The Integral Fast Reactor.</i>

876
01:05:45,108 --> 01:05:47,430
<i>The budget was about $100 million a year.</i>

877
01:05:48,733 --> 01:05:54,066
<i>1,500 people,
scientists, engineers, supporting staff.</i>

878
01:05:54,858 --> 01:05:58,358
<i>This was a very big development program.</i>

879
01:05:59,442 --> 01:06:02,775
But you've got to test it.

880
01:06:03,691 --> 01:06:06,525
Calculations don't tell you everything.

881
01:06:06,566 --> 01:06:10,566
You've got to have the big facilities
and say:

882
01:06:10,608 --> 01:06:14,566
"If we have an accident of this kind,
what will happen?"

883
01:06:15,275 --> 01:06:18,110
We're now going to set-up the test...

884
01:06:17,142 --> 01:06:18,104
April, 1986

885
01:06:18,134 --> 01:06:21,870
<i>We did two experiments to demonstrate
some unique safety features</i>

886
01:06:21,933 --> 01:06:25,144
<i>that that reactor has, that
others don't have,</i>

887
01:06:25,233 --> 01:06:28,108
and invited people from all over the world
to come and witness it;

888
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:30,491
T minus 2 minutes.

889
01:06:30,525 --> 01:06:34,983
Station black-out is a term
that is used by N.R.C., the safety folks,

890
01:06:35,025 --> 01:06:40,025
to describe the situation where one
loses all bulk AC power.

891
01:06:40,066 --> 01:06:42,025
You assume that you lose all site power.

892
01:06:42,066 --> 01:06:45,441
You assume that you are getting no AC power
from your own turbogenerator.

893
01:06:45,483 --> 01:06:49,400
You assume that your first diesel
started up and it failed to start up.

894
01:06:49,441 --> 01:06:52,691
The second one started to start
and it also failed.

895
01:06:52,733 --> 01:06:55,983
So, you end up dead in the water
with no AC power.

896
01:06:57,108 --> 01:07:02,025
<i>This experiment was almost
a direct parallel</i>

897
01:07:02,066 --> 01:07:04,025
<i>to what happened at Fukushima.</i>

898
01:07:05,150 --> 01:07:09,584
<i>- It was eerily similar.</i>
- Mark.

899
01:07:09,623 --> 01:07:11,858
<i>We ran the reactor at full power,</i>

900
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:13,913
<i>disabled the shut-down system</i>

901
01:07:13,915 --> 01:07:17,483
<i>so that the operators had
no ability to shut the reactor down.</i>

902
01:07:18,733 --> 01:07:21,608
And we shut-off the cooling system,
didn't extract the heat,

903
01:07:21,650 --> 01:07:23,816
so we just let things get hotter.

904
01:07:25,150 --> 01:07:28,025
<i>In most reactors,
you can't do it.</i>

905
01:07:28,441 --> 01:07:31,108
<i>No reactor that I know of, could
survive that accident.</i>

906
01:07:31,150 --> 01:07:33,108
<i>You have a melt-down.</i>

907
01:07:33,691 --> 01:07:37,233
<i>The international audience were
watching the temperature</i>

908
01:07:37,275 --> 01:07:40,483
<i>going up like that, straight up.</i>

909
01:07:40,525 --> 01:07:43,066
They turned around like so,
to see if I was,

910
01:07:43,108 --> 01:07:45,983
or if the Argonne guys were running.

911
01:07:46,983 --> 01:07:49,025
By the time they looked up again,

912
01:07:49,066 --> 01:07:52,400
the trace had turned
like so, and it was on its way down,

913
01:07:52,441 --> 01:07:55,650
and the reactor just quietly shut
itself down.

914
01:07:56,025 --> 01:07:58,691
<i>No action required of the operators,</i>

915
01:07:58,733 --> 01:08:02,275
<i>no action required of the safety systems,
nothing.</i>

916
01:08:02,316 --> 01:08:06,900
<i>You could just stand back like this,
watched the dials if you wished,</i>

917
01:08:06,941 --> 01:08:09,983
<i>and the reactor shut itself down.</i>

918
01:08:10,983 --> 01:08:13,941
- 30 seconds.
- 30 seconds to test time.

919
01:08:13,983 --> 01:08:18,066
<i>Well, in the afternoon
we started the reactor up again,</i>

920
01:08:18,108 --> 01:08:19,858
<i>and carried out the conditions</i>

921
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:23,066
<i>responsible for the accident
at Three Mile Island.</i>

922
01:08:23,108 --> 01:08:24,400
5, 4...

923
01:08:24,441 --> 01:08:26,233
<i>We shut off the pumps.</i>

924
01:08:26,275 --> 01:08:28,816
<i>Just shut off the pumps.</i>

925
01:08:32,025 --> 01:08:33,983
<i>All major reactor accidents</i>

926

<i>happen because of one thing:</i>

928
01:08:38,650 --> 01:08:40,941
<i>inadequate cooling.</i>

929
01:08:41,858 --> 01:08:48,066
<i>The IFR type reactor,
which EBR-II was a prototype for,</i>

930
01:08:48,108 --> 01:08:52,775
if you cut it off from the steam systems
so it cannot reject its heat,

931
01:08:52,816 --> 01:08:54,691
it will just shut itself down.

932
01:08:54,733 --> 01:08:56,566
So it can't melt down?

933
01:08:56,608 --> 01:08:58,983
No, it can't melt down.

934
01:09:07,608 --> 01:09:09,970
REPROCESSING FACILITY
Idaho National Laboratory

935
01:09:10,017 --> 01:09:15,066
<i>We are now in the facility that completes
the circle, if you like,</i>

936
01:09:15,108 --> 01:09:16,733
<i>of the Integral Fast Reactor.</i>

937
01:09:16,775 --> 01:09:21,400
<i>We've come out of the reactor building,
we're now in the fuel-cycle part.</i>

938
01:09:22,025 --> 01:09:23,316
The intimate part of it was

939
01:09:23,358 --> 01:09:27,483
that every part of a
complete nuclear reactor system,

940
01:09:27,525 --> 01:09:33,525
not the reactor itself, but also
the facilities for treating the spent fuel,

941
01:09:33,566 --> 01:09:35,566
for treating the waste,

942
01:09:35,608 --> 01:09:38,025
would all be an integral part
of the same system.

943
01:09:38,066 --> 01:09:40,858
<i>Ready for the transfer.
Bring it over to me...</i>

944
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:45,483
<i>What this enables you to do is
you can take the spent fuel</i>

945
01:09:46,108 --> 01:09:50,025
<i>chop it up,
and back it goes into the reactor.</i>

946
01:09:52,025 --> 01:09:58,566
<i>You can recycle the fuel again and again
until the end of plant life.</i>

947
01:09:58,608 --> 01:10:01,775
<i>Ready to receive fuel.</i>

948
01:10:03,483 --> 01:10:07,608
The other thing that needs to be said
about all of this technology

949
01:10:07,650 --> 01:10:10,983
is that this is not... a dream.

950
01:10:11,025 --> 01:10:14,691
This is not somebody's calculations
on a piece of paper.

951
01:10:14,733 --> 01:10:18,608
This is real. We know how
to do these things.

952
01:10:19,775 --> 01:10:23,191
<i>Now, let me frame this debate, if I may,</i>

953
01:10:23,233 --> 01:10:26,691
<i>by reading a letter from
the President of the United States,</i>

954
01:10:26,733 --> 01:10:27,941
<i>sent to me yesterday.</i>

955
01:10:29,150 --> 01:10:30,848
"Thank you for your letter

956
01:10:30,850 --> 01:10:34,953

962
01:10:52,733 --> 01:10:56,358
<i>Democrats have gotten themselves
on the wrong side,</i>

963
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:58,650
<i>in my opinion, in this issue.</i>

964
01:10:58,691 --> 01:11:02,275
Being opposed to nuclear power,
for, I think, no good reason

965
01:11:02,316 --> 01:11:06,316
other than it's very high on the list
of what Republicans like.

966
01:11:06,358 --> 01:11:08,941
We know
that nuclear energy is clean.

967
01:11:10,525 --> 01:11:13,191
We know that it
doesn't pollute the air.

968
01:11:13,233 --> 01:11:15,650
We know that
it doesn't damage the ozone.

969
01:11:15,691 --> 01:11:19,358
We know that it is a tremendous producer
of energy in a clean sense

970
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:23,025
and our only problem is that
we can not come to political terms

971
01:11:23,066 --> 01:11:24,983
on how to handle the waste stream.

972
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:27,820
We're talking about what it's gonna cost.

973
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:30,983
If we go that far and continue

974
01:11:32,650 --> 01:11:36,025
our obsession with nuclear power.

975
01:11:36,134 --> 01:11:38,246
IFR waste streams

976
01:11:39,130 --> 01:11:44,302
lose their radioactivity to background
level in about 800 years.

977
01:11:44,483 --> 01:11:47,816
Light water reactor,
in nearly 10,000.

978
01:11:47,858 --> 01:11:51,858
I share with my colleagues
some of the public opinion on this.

979
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:55,066
The Washington Post:
"The Wrong Reactor."

980
01:11:55,108 --> 01:11:58,400
The Oregonian:
"Give Up Nuclear Breeder Dream."

981
01:11:58,441 --> 01:12:02,900
The San Francisco Chronicle:
"Saying No to Nuclear Pork."

982
01:12:02,941 --> 01:12:06,900
<i>The IFR program was shut down.</i>

983
01:12:07,816 --> 01:12:13,650
<i>And the project went down the black hole
of Government politics.</i>

984
01:12:34,691 --> 01:12:38,608
<i>It was by chance,
about the year 2000, I think,</i>

985
01:12:38,650 --> 01:12:42,816
<i>I wound up in the desert,
on a visit to Yucca Mountain.</i>

986
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:47,316
<i>America's planned nuclear waste
repository</i>

987
01:12:47,358 --> 01:12:50,733
<i>100 miles north of Las Vegas.</i>

988
01:12:53,494 --> 01:12:56,868
<i>A hole in the ground
where 10-plus billion dollars were spent</i>

989
01:12:56,900 --> 01:12:59,365
<i>on vastly expensive experiments.</i>

990
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:03,637
<i>Trying to prove that this place is
going to be absolutely safe</i>

991
01:13:03,639 --> 01:13:06,440
<i>over the next 10,000 years.</i>

992
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:13,191
So, I just felt like, wait a minute!
This is nuts!

993
01:13:13,233 --> 01:13:15,483
Among other things,
have you even thought:

994
01:13:15,525 --> 01:13:18,488
No, we are professional futurists,
many of us who are on this trip,

995
01:13:21,192 --> 01:13:25,496
what exactly is this world 10,000 years
from now that we are trying to protect?

996
01:13:27,222 --> 01:13:29,316
<i>Science Fiction</i>

997
01:13:29,347 --> 01:13:32,737
<i>is what we are playing out,
at vast expense, at Yucca Mountain.</i>

998
01:13:35,733 --> 01:13:38,525
<i>The kinds of experiments they were
doing at that mountain,</i>

999
01:13:38,566 --> 01:13:40,233
<i>it's not a mountain, it's just a ridge,</i>

1000
01:13:40,275 --> 01:13:42,483
<i>certainly didn't persuade anybody.</i>

1001
01:13:43,816 --> 01:13:47,608
<i>For political reasons,
Yucca Mountain was not opened,</i>

1002
01:13:47,650 --> 01:13:50,275
<i>and will probably never be opened.</i>

1003
01:13:53,108 --> 01:13:56,566
Then, I started to look at,
well, what actually is

1004
01:13:56,608 --> 01:13:59,445
the amount of hazard that comes
from nuclear waste?

1005
01:14:00,191 --> 01:14:03,848
<i>The first thing I found out is what people
are actually doing with the nuclear waste</i>

1006
01:14:03,850 --> 01:14:06,214
<i>which is being generated
all this time</i>

1007
01:14:06,441 --> 01:14:10,691
<i>by every nuclear power plant.
Turns out to be pretty good.</i>

1008
01:14:11,233 --> 01:14:17,941
<i>They put it in this, pretty simple,
but very workable dry-cask storage.</i>

1009
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:21,025
<i>And they park it out at
the back of the parking lot.</i>

1010
01:14:21,066 --> 01:14:23,025
<i>And you can go there and see it.</i>

1011
01:14:24,025 --> 01:14:26,525
<i>There's the nation's nuclear waste.</i>

1012
01:14:26,566 --> 01:14:28,900
<i>Is it causing any problems?</i>

1013
01:14:29,581 --> 01:14:30,816
<i>No.</i>

1014
01:14:31,078 --> 01:14:33,458
OUTSIDE WASTE CANISTER
0.10 microsieverts per hour.

1015
01:14:34,691 --> 01:14:37,463
<i>The other realization for me,
and it took a while to get through,</i>

1016
01:14:37,465 --> 01:14:39,481
<i>is that by not putting it in the ground,</i>

1017
01:14:39,483 --> 01:14:44,498
<i>you've got the option to use it as fuel
in 4th generation reactors.</i>

1018
01:14:44,816 --> 01:14:48,191
Wow! We can take this waste
from the nuclear plant

1019
01:14:48,233 --> 01:14:50,558
and recycle it into fuel

1020
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:54,914
either by reprocessing, or by having a
new kind of reactor that uses this fuel.

1021
01:14:56,432 --> 01:15:00,096
That looks very much like
a renewable resource.

1022
01:15:03,288 --> 01:15:06,705
<i>People are always talking
about nuclear waste,</i>

1023
01:15:06,983 --> 01:15:09,733
<i>the accumulation of nuclear waste,</i>

1024
01:15:09,775 --> 01:15:11,733
<i>and I did too.</i>

1025
01:15:13,441 --> 01:15:15,763
I think it's around 70,000 tons

1026
01:15:15,765 --> 01:15:19,935
have accumulated, of
used fuel in the United States.

1027
01:15:20,233 --> 01:15:23,108
<i>I thought the quantity was staggering.</i>

1028
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:26,358
<i>In fact, all the spent
nuclear fuel</i>

1029
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:29,358
<i>from commercial nuclear plants
in the United States</i>

1030
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:32,316
<i>could fit in a single football field,</i>

1031
01:15:32,358 --> 01:15:36,983
<i>if you stacked the fuel rods to
a height of about 3 meters.</i>

1032
01:15:37,204 --> 01:15:39,025
<i>That's it.</i>

1033
01:15:40,483 --> 01:15:44,066
<i>But of that,
only a very small fraction,</i>

1034
01:15:44,108 --> 01:15:47,525
<i>mainly plutonium, is long-lived.</i>

1035
01:15:47,941 --> 01:15:52,650
<i>By long-lived, I mean that it would
still be "hot" thousands of years from now,</i>

1036
01:15:52,691 --> 01:15:55,275
<i>still be highly radioactive.</i>

1037
01:16:03,025 --> 01:16:07,358
<i>Volumetrically, nuclear produces
tiny amounts of waste.</i>

1038
01:16:08,691 --> 01:16:13,275
<i>The entire waste production from
France's 50 nuclear power stations,</i>

1039
01:16:13,316 --> 01:16:15,448
<i>which produce 80% of the
country's electricity</i>

1040
01:16:15,450 --> 01:16:17,941
<i>are under the floor in one room.</i>

1041
01:16:18,691 --> 01:16:20,426
<i>Compare that with the
billions of tons of waste</i>

1042
01:16:20,428 --> 01:16:22,894
<i>produced by coal-fired
power stations.</i>

1043
01:16:24,816 --> 01:16:28,275
<i>It completely blows away
most of the anti-nuclear arguments.</i>

1044
01:16:31,404 --> 01:16:33,441
So it's... it's not...

1045
01:16:33,483 --> 01:16:35,650
Nuclear waste is not
an environmental issue.

1046
01:16:35,691 --> 01:16:39,150
It's not something which, as an
environmentalist, I'm concerned about.

1047
01:16:45,066 --> 01:16:49,441
<i>One of the most inspiring stories anywhere,
is the story of France.</i>

1048
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:58,066
<i>Here was a country, in the early '70s
that was burning oil for electricity.</i>

1049
01:16:58,108 --> 01:17:00,525
<i>It doesn't have coal reserves,</i>

1050
01:17:00,566 --> 01:17:05,150
<i>it doesn't want to be dependent on gas
coming from Northern Europe and Russia.</i>

1051
01:17:06,525 --> 01:17:09,798
But, when the oil shocks happened and
the prices went up dramatically,

1052
01:17:09,853 --> 01:17:13,228
the French realized that
they needed to get serious

1053
01:17:13,244 --> 01:17:15,202
about a different source of energy.

1054
01:17:17,025 --> 01:17:22,816
<i>They said this was serious
and it has to do with national security.</i>

1055
01:17:22,858 --> 01:17:27,775
<i>So, they focused on making sure
they had the best nuclear engineers</i>

1056
01:17:28,108 --> 01:17:33,941
<i>and the standard design for the reactors,
and they just rolled it out.</i>

1057
01:17:38,233 --> 01:17:40,983
<i>What's so significant
about what the French did,</i>

1058
01:17:42,025 --> 01:17:44,900
<i>is that they did it so quickly.</i>

1059
01:17:44,941 --> 01:17:47,775
<i>They scaled up almost exactly
at the pace</i>

1060
01:17:47,816 --> 01:17:51,358
<i>that we need to scale up
nuclear power globally.</i>

1061
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:56,525
<i>They now have 80% of their electricity
coming from nuclear.</i>

1062
01:17:56,894 --> 01:17:59,275
<i>The trains are electric powered.</i>

1063
01:18:00,108 --> 01:18:02,150
<i>They have clean air.</i>

1064
01:18:03,233 --> 01:18:05,566
<i>They have the cheapest energy in Europe.</i>

1065
01:18:05,608 --> 01:18:07,900
<i>They're selling it to everybody else.</i>

1066
01:18:07,941 --> 01:18:10,608
And they are greener than
Green Denmark,

1067
01:18:10,650 --> 01:18:11,900
greener than Green Germany.

1068
01:18:14,316 --> 01:18:19,316
<i>I didn't know what French per capita
carbon dioxide emissions were,</i>

1069
01:18:19,358 --> 01:18:22,441
<i>which is actually the most important
question to ask.</i>

1070
01:18:23,108 --> 01:18:26,525
<i>The answer is they are about 5 tons
per person per year.</i>

1071
01:18:26,566 --> 01:18:28,608
<i>Germany is about 10 tons per year.</i>

1072
01:18:29,858 --> 01:18:33,400
So, Germany has much, much higher per
person emissions of carbon dioxide

1073
01:18:33,441 --> 01:18:35,283
than neighbouring France because
France is nuclear

1074
01:18:35,285 --> 01:18:38,509
and Germany is trying to
get out of nuclear.

1075
01:18:45,983 --> 01:18:47,733
<i>When we look at nuclear</i>

1076
01:18:47,775 --> 01:18:52,650
<i>we have to understand that
we are making a long-term investment.</i>

1077
01:18:52,691 --> 01:18:55,733
<i>Now, it's a big up-front
capital cost.</i>

1078
01:18:55,775 --> 01:18:59,525
<i>But these are plants that are going to last
60, 80, maybe even 100 years.</i>

1079
01:18:59,714 --> 01:19:04,589
<i>And much of the other infrastructure that's
being built will last far longer than that.</i>

1080
01:19:05,941 --> 01:19:08,159
<i>And, when you really look at it that way,</i>

1081
01:19:08,818 --> 01:19:10,060
<i>there's just really no question,</i>

1082
01:19:10,066 --> 01:19:15,316
<i>it's a much more economical alternative
to very expensive solar panels,</i>

1083
01:19:15,358 --> 01:19:19,250
<i>or very expensive wind turbines
that require back-up power.</i>

1084
01:19:25,025 --> 01:19:27,639
<i>The current generation of reactors
we're building now,</i>

1085
01:19:27,662 --> 01:19:29,827
<i>are third generation reactors.</i>

1086
01:19:30,358 --> 01:19:33,691
<i>This technology is much safer.</i>

1087
01:19:33,733 --> 01:19:37,733
<i>But fourth generation reactors,
like the Integral Fast Reactors</i>

1088
01:19:37,775 --> 01:19:42,650
<i>can use the waste from the first
three generations as fuel.</i>

1089
01:19:43,441 --> 01:19:46,608
<i>The great philanthropist, Bill Gates</i>

1090
01:19:46,650 --> 01:19:50,066
<i>has put money and time into
a Travelling Wave Reactor,</i>

1091
01:19:50,108 --> 01:19:54,066
<i>that you basically stick in the ground
and it goes through its body of fuel</i>

1092
01:19:54,108 --> 01:19:56,858
<i>over a period of 60 years.
You don't need to refuel it.</i>

1093
01:19:57,634 --> 01:20:01,608
<i>There's a thorium reactor
that the same group is working on.</i>

1094
01:20:02,108 --> 01:20:05,733
<i>Other fourth generation,
coming along with a small modular reactor.</i>

1095
01:20:05,775 --> 01:20:08,816
<i>They look exactly like the kind of
local power source</i>

1096
01:20:08,858 --> 01:20:12,900
<i>that environmentalists are increasingly
saying we should have.</i>

1097
01:20:12,941 --> 01:20:17,275
<i>So, there's a renaissance
in reactor design,</i>

1098
01:20:17,316 --> 01:20:20,525
<i>that those are just the
first glimpses of.</i>

1099
01:20:25,728 --> 01:20:32,733
For some people, who perhaps
accept most of these arguments,

1100
01:20:32,775 --> 01:20:35,483
in favour of nuclear power,

1101
01:20:35,525 --> 01:20:38,816
the ultimate argument is:

1102
01:20:39,358 --> 01:20:42,900
"But knowledge of this technology

1103
01:20:42,941 --> 01:20:47,358
"is also the kind of knowledge you
can use to make nuclear weapons."

1104
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:49,941
And that's quite true. It is.

1105
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:56,900
<i>There are, by the CIA's estimate,
about 37 countries in the world today,</i>

1106
01:20:56,941 --> 01:21:00,108
<i>that if they wanted to,
could develop nuclear weapons.</i>

1107
01:21:00,150 --> 01:21:05,200
<i>They have the technical and scientific
infrastructure to be able to do that.</i>

1108
01:21:06,650 --> 01:21:09,483
<i>How many countries
actually have nuclear weapons?</i>

1109
01:21:09,525 --> 01:21:11,066
<i>Nine.</i>

1110
01:21:11,983 --> 01:21:18,358
<i>Which, I think, begins to point out
the fundamental flaw in the concern.</i>

1111
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:23,275
We won't get rid of nuclear weapons
by forgetting how to make them.

1112
01:21:23,316 --> 01:21:25,733
We will get rid of nuclear weapons

1113
01:21:25,775 --> 01:21:29,233
by deciding we don't want
them around anymore.

1114
01:21:32,566 --> 01:21:36,858
<i>It turns out that the United States
has been buying up nuclear warheads</i>

1115
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:40,691
<i>from the Russians
for over 10 years now.</i>

1116
01:21:40,733 --> 01:21:44,983
<i>16,000 nuclear warheads.</i>

1117
01:21:45,858 --> 01:21:48,691
<i>And we're recycling all of these
nuclear warheads</i>

1118
01:21:48,733 --> 01:21:52,941
<i>into energy,
electricity, nuclear power.</i>

1119
01:21:55,066 --> 01:21:59,358
<i>And so, nuclear power is doing more
to de-nuclear-weaponise the world</i>

1120
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:01,900
<i>than any other thing we do.</i>

1121
01:22:04,608 --> 01:22:06,816
<i>Poetically, it's rather beautiful.</i>

1122
01:22:06,858 --> 01:22:12,358
<i>The very things that were designed
to blow up our cities</i>

1123
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:16,108
<i>are now lighting up our cities.</i>

1124
01:22:19,150 --> 01:22:23,025
<i>And, basically, 10% of
American electricity,</i>

1125
01:22:23,066 --> 01:22:25,441
<i>half of our nuclear power</i>

1126
01:22:25,483 --> 01:22:29,858
<i>comes from reprocessed
Russian warheads.</i>

1127
01:22:31,483 --> 01:22:34,275
<i>Ideally, every single nuclear
weapon in the world</i>

1128
01:22:34,316 --> 01:22:38,025
<i>eventually, can get turned
into electricity.</i>

1129
01:22:48,816 --> 01:22:51,858
<i>I believe that while much
of the environmental movement</i>

1130
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:54,733
<i>that came of age in the '60s
will never change,</i>

1131
01:22:55,483 --> 01:22:59,733
<i>I feel very confident
that the next generation will.</i>

1132
01:22:59,775 --> 01:23:05,066
<i>They're going to understand the challenges
they face in an energy hungry world.</i>

1133
01:23:05,108 --> 01:23:08,983
<i>And, they're going to put nuclear
in its proper context.</i>

1134
01:23:10,345 --> 01:23:15,900
<i>We can have a world
of 7, 8, 9, 10 billion people</i>

1135
01:23:15,941 --> 01:23:22,108
<i>that are living high-energy,
resource intensive modern lives,</i>

1136
01:23:22,525 --> 01:23:24,931
<i>without killing the climate.</i>

1137
01:23:27,316 --> 01:23:30,275
<i>And that's exciting.</i>

1138
01:23:35,191 --> 01:23:38,983
<i>I have the sense that this is the
beginning of something really beautiful.</i>

1139
01:23:53,678 --> 01:23:56,369
<i>You actually do feel like
this is the beginning of a movement.</i>
