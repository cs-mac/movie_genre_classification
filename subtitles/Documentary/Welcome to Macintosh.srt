1
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:25,088
<i>This is a Macintosh.</i>

2
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:28,124
<i>It comes from a little company</i>
<i>called Apple.</i>

3
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:32,059
<i>Apple was started in a small town</i>
<i>in northern California by two friends:</i>

4
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:34,733
<i>Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak.</i>

5
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:38,563
<i>United by their interest in technology,</i>
<i>and dissatisfied with the attempts...</i>

6
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:42,173
<i>... at personal computers by others,</i>
<i>they knew they could do better...</i>

7
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,105
<i>... and set out to make the world's</i>
<i>first good personal computer...</i>

8
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:46,869
<i>... in the form of the Apple I.</i>

9
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,570
<i>The Apple I became the Apple II.</i>

10
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:50,874
<i>The Apple II</i>
<i>became the cornerstone...</i>

11
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:53,109
<i>... of an industry</i>
<i>that would change the world.</i>

12
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:56,349
<i>In 1984, Apple introduced Macintosh...</i>

13
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:59,923
<i>... and Macintosh thrusted the industry</i>
<i>forward into a new era.</i>

14
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:02,993
<i>Its style and ease of use</i>
<i>gave computers to the rest of us...</i>

15
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:05,790
<i>... and inspired the next revolution</i>
<i>in computing.</i>

16
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:07,261
<i>But dark times followed...</i>

17
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:10,603
<i>... and Apple slipped into the background</i>
<i>of the computer industry.</i>

18
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:14,831
<i>In the late '90s, a reinvigorated Apple</i>
<i>would return to shake things up again...</i>

19
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:17,339
<i>... and push the envelope of design</i>
<i>and engineering.</i>

20
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:21,977
<i>Whether you know it or not,</i>
<i>these events have changed your life.</i>

21
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,156
We're good. We got your sound?

22
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:33,552
- Is she on speaker?
- Yeah.

23
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,784
Jordan, hold on.

24
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:37,493
- Are you ready to go?
- Yeah.

25
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:39,355
Okay, so this is the story...

26
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:44,401
...of how I was introduced
to Macintosh unintentionally.

27
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:48,299
My first Macintosh was an SE...

28
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:52,410
...with a 30-megabyte hard drive.

29
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:57,072
The first Mac I used
was my dad's Classic.

30
00:01:57,283 --> 00:02:00,741
He had a Mac Classic, a Mac Plus...

31
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:04,856
First Macintosh I purchased
was on the day of the introduction.

32
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:06,889
Well, I had an Apple II in '79.

33
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,321
And then I had an Apple III.

34
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:14,398
And then I got to play with a Lisa
in 1980.

35
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:19,867
I had a Blue and White G3,
had a Lombard PowerBook...

36
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:23,668
...had a Pismo PowerBook,
had a Titanium PowerBook.

37
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:27,608
I was given a Macintosh 128
as one of the...

38
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,248
...you know,
first hundred people in the Mac division.

39
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,917
The first computer that we had...

40
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:36,449
The LC, right, which I had to
take away from you...

41
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:40,114
...because you told me
it was gonna cost $2500...

42
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,055
...I gave you my credit card...

43
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:43,854
Thirty-five hundred.

44
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:46,793
I think it must've been about 1980,
I played with a Lisa...

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,934
...and that changed everything.

46
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:53,128
So it had two floppies in front
and a 30-meg hard drive...

47
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:56,570
...and I thought I was in heaven.

48
00:02:56,776 --> 00:03:01,042
I mean, how could anybody ever use
that much hard-drive space?

49
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:04,978
After the introduction, we were so keyed
up we couldn't really go back to work.

50
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,780
So that afternoon we drove around
to the different computer stores...

51
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:12,389
...in the Bay Area,
trying to purchase a Mac.

52
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:16,494
The first one I owned, the first one I
bought with my own money, was a 7200.

53
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:19,527
And I bought an expensive monitor...

54
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:23,725
...and it cost me about $3500.

55
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:29,401
I got my Aluminum PowerBook,
I had a dual 800 G4 with a SuperDrive.

56
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:32,942
I've got my G5 at home.

57
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:34,135
I stopped counting.

58
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:38,141
Yeah, you ended up spending 7000,
so I had to go...

59
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:42,720
...and retrieve the computer from you
and get it back.

60
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:45,720
And so I inherited this computer...

61
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:49,918
...that I had no fucking idea
what to do with or anything.

62
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:54,266
And it was, like, a lot of money.

63
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:56,958
I had to borrow it off my mom.

64
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,995
And it took me years to pay her back.

65
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:06,077
If you think about it, from '84 to 2007,
you know, that's 20-something years.

66
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,679
I've probably had 50 Macs.

67
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:15,144
And basically I've had a Mac
since April of '84 and pretty much...

68
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:18,481
...have had almost every Mac
in my hands since then.

69
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:23,924
So that's how I was introduced
to Apple.

70
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:28,294
I had to go and get it from you
and retrieve it from you...

71
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:31,197
...because you had spent too much
money on my credit card.

72
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,372
It was the hardest thing I ever did.

73
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:37,532
I had to go and retrieve the computer
from my own son.

74
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:42,442
Yeah, it was pretty hard, man.
It was not easy.

75
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:46,016
Okay, all right, all right.
So that ends that discussion, okay.

76
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:49,245
All right, so we're gonna move on now.
Okay, bye.

77
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:58,196
Apple was founded twice.

78
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:00,195
And each time
there were three founders.

79
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,228
Two of them were Woz and Jobs...

80
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:07,805
...but the third one, in both cases,
is not extremely well-known.

81
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:10,669
In the first case,
it was this guy named Ron Wayne...

82
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:13,641
...who was just sort of a smart,
general-purpose guy.

83
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:19,109
He, being artistically inclined,
drew that first Newton logo...

84
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,652
...that the Apple Computer Company,
not the corporation, had.

85
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,656
The logo essentially was my own idea.

86
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:30,158
They had hit upon the idea of using
the name Apple for Apple Computer.

87
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:33,992
Once they had done that,
and if you have an original idea...

88
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,863
...and you have an apple and you...
The two simply fall together.

89
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:41,837
The classic story
of Newton and the apple.

90
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,908
And so it was that I sat down...

91
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:46,942
...and thoroughly enjoyed myself...

92
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:51,810
...with India ink and pen
and illustration board...

93
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:57,354
...and went ahead and created this
image of Newton with the apple above...

94
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:00,249
...in a detailed, wind-blown ribbon...

95
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,293
...that had
the "Apple Computer Company" on it.

96
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:08,557
And around the border I had put in
the philosophical comment:

97
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:12,768
"Mind forever voyaging through
strange seas of thought alone."

98
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:18,103
Which, of course,
comes from the Wordsworth sonnet.

99
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:23,245
And that last line seemed to fit perfectly
with the whole concept...

100
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:25,314
...of this wonderful new product...

101
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:28,351
...that was going to make the foundation
of a new company.

102
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:33,253
Apple was founded again, though,
as a corporation in 1977...

103
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:35,051
...and third founder was Mike Markkula.

104
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:37,422
He's a little more well-known
than Ron Wayne.

105
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:42,159
When Apple came out, they were
building the Apple I's in the garage.

106
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:46,938
The Apple I could have a keyboard
attached directly to it...

107
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,974
...and a computer monitor attached to it
instead of lights and switches.

108
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:53,111
You could actually have
your own interface.

109
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:57,271
It was groundbreaking technology.

110
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:00,045
Wozniak had designed this
genius piece of engineering...

111
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:04,848
...but he wanted to give it away.
What kind of crazy idea is that?

112
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:08,026
So Jobs was the one who figured out
this thing should be sold.

113
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:10,491
What Woz said recently...

114
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:14,632
...I think he said, "I don't want credit for
designing the first personal computer...

115
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:17,598
...I just want credit
for designing the first good one."

116
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:35,180
Rumor has it that Jobs
hated the Apple I.

117
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:38,687
I've heard numerous stories
that it didn't work properly all the time...

118
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:40,586
...or there was issues with it.

119
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,057
They were encouraging
and promoting the Apple II,

120
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:47,289
so they were giving discounts on
Apple II's if you traded in your Apple I.

121
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,695
Sometimes they would do
an outright swap.

122
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:51,631
They wanted them off the market.

123
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,669
Then they were getting
bandsawed in half.

124
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:59,010
But there was supposedly
200 boards made.

125
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:03,080
Now, not all of those were sold.
I hear Woz has some in storage...

126
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:05,477
...who knows how many,
maybe a half dozen or so.

127
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:06,674
Value?

128
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:09,377
I've heard as high as 50,000 for one,

129
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:12,490
but a perfectly running one in a case
is gonna fetch more.

130
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:15,183
If it's got the cassette and
the manuals and all that stuff.

131
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:20,864
I started doing my research
on the Apple I's and the value of them.

132
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:23,399
Pretty much realized
I could never afford one.

133
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:27,369
And I had gone to
the user-group website Applefritter.

134
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:31,072
I talked to some people
and there was discussion...

135
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:35,611
...about making a replica of one, and
nobody really stepped to the plate, so...

136
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:38,113
It was a lot of research.

137
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:41,844
I've still, to this day, never seen
an actual Apple I in operation.

138
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:44,249
A lot of it, electronically,
I could figure out.

139
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:47,358
Some of it, visually,
there was no way to tell without...

140
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,391
...asking people, so I had to interview...

141
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:51,995
...owners or previous owners
of Apple I's to see:

142
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:56,430
"Hey, what does the cursor look like?
Is it solid, is it blinking?"

143
00:08:56,636 --> 00:09:00,402
It's authentic and it's true to its
memory locations and it's functioning.

144
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:04,337
It will completely operate
just like the Apple I.

145
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:07,712
There wasn't really a lot of
commercial software available.

146
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:10,348
Most of the stuff was converted from...

147
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,075
...programs that were given out in
<i>Creative Computing</i> magazines...

148
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:17,723
...or written initially for another computer,
which was converted over to the Apple I.

149
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,954
There was no such thing
as a production case for it.

150
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,529
Most Apple I's that you see in a wooden
case, somebody built on their own.

151
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:29,524
One of the most common things l...
Questions I had was:

152
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,067
"Why didn't you
make it look like an Apple I?"

153
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:35,502
I didn't want people selling these
as forgeries, as being an actual Apple I.

154
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:42,043
For one, it's Woz's work, and I don't
want anybody infracting on that.

155
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,682
It's respect for the people
that actually do own the Apple I's.

156
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:47,853
I don't want this project
to devalue the Apple I.

157
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:51,387
I had tried getting ahold of somebody
from Apple and, you know, saying:

158
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,822
"This is what's going on. Can I get
permission to use the source code?"

159
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:56,824
I didn't hear anything back...

160
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:00,465
...so I tried to get ahold of Woz
through his website...

161
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,794
...and next thing you know,
Wozniak had written back, saying:

162
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:07,439
"Go ahead and use the source code.
I think it's, you know, a noble idea.

163
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,076
Apple probably wouldn't let you, but
the worst thing Apple could say was...

164
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,643
...that it was mine long before
there was an Apple computer."

165
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:16,913
He had given out the source code,
schematics and everything...

166
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:20,108
...at the Homebrew Computer Clubs
long before Apple existed.

167
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:23,220
So it was pretty much his source code
to give out.

168
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:28,619
I guess, yeah, they're kind of an
unlikely couple, an unlikely pair, to...

169
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:32,161
You know, Steve Wozniak
was the hardware genius.

170
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:37,428
He's kind of a blue-collar hacker,
interested only in the engineering.

171
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:44,803
Jobs was the salesman, the slick,
smooth talker, good-Iooking young guy.

172
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:49,605
You gotta remember, the Apple II
were designed essentially by kids...

173
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:53,148
...who didn't have any success
behind them.

174
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:59,717
And Woz is like a hero,
the great nerd hero of our times.

175
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:03,622
I mean, every geek and nerd
reveres Woz.

176
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:10,234
He is, you know, a living legend,
a demigod, a god amongst man.

177
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,365
Not only for his genius, but just
for that sort of purity of hacker spirit...

178
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:18,202
...you know,
the generosity of his genius.

179
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:22,609
The idea that he's not motivated
to enrich himself.

180
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:26,512
You know. He wants to build
astonishing things.

181
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:28,211
And he did.

182
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:32,323
This was more... The Apple II was more
like a work of art, it was whimsical.

183
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:36,785
It was outrageous,
some of the techniques in the ROM.

184
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:40,762
And so as I worked
my way through it, I thought:

185
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:43,662
"Who would design
in such a style and why?"

186
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:47,430
And it's just the greatest thing
I'd ever encountered.

187
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,335
It was very much like...

188
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,170
...reading a great novel
from an author you've never heard of...

189
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,073
...or hearing a great piece of music.

190
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,283
It captivated me.

191
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:57,908
It captivated me.

192
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:25,139
One of the biggest success stories
would have to be Team Number 1.

193
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:30,481
Team Number 1
was the original franchisee...

194
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:35,082
...of the Team Electronics chain.
Team Central was the organization...

195
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:37,915
...of all the Team Electronics stores,
some 100 stores...

196
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:41,616
...mostly in the upper Midwest,
and it continues to operate to this day.

197
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:43,488
They've changed their name
to FirstTech...

198
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:45,823
...with the demise of Team Electronics.

199
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:47,999
But to my knowledge,
that would make them...

200
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,660
...the longest continuously running
Apple reseller in the United States.

201
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:59,903
- There's more back there. Yeah.
- You've got a Bell + Howell.

202
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:04,573
I don't think we ever wanna fly this.
It's probably not...

203
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,649
- Not flight-worthy?
- Whoa, is that a kite?

204
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:09,582
- It is, but it's just too valuable, you know.
- Oh, yeah.

205
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:14,055
We got an Apple III back there
and some other stuff too.

206
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,491
But most... This is mostly the fun stuff.

207
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:20,696
- Oh, yeah.
- And we're pretty sure it all works.

208
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:27,937
Back in 1977, I convinced my boss...
At the time I was working as a buyer...

209
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,906
...for the Team Electronics chain, which
was headquartered here in Minneapolis.

210
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:37,811
- convinced him to let me go to the
first annual West Coast Computer Faire.

211
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:40,850
Out there, I discovered
a number of companies.

212
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:43,248
I'd gone to look
at the processor Sol machine.

213
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:45,355
I was already aware of the Altair.

214
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:47,455
Discovered a little company
called Apple...

215
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,686
...who had a pretty good-sized booth
right inside the front door.

216
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:52,796
Struck up a conversation
with the gentleman...

217
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,898
...who told me they really
weren't producing yet.

218
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,264
It would probably be later that year,
October, something like that.

219
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:01,939
The gentleman seemed
quite knowledgeable...

220
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:05,042
...and once he found out
that I was a buyer...

221
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:07,644
...for a chain of electronics stores,
was very interested...

222
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,441
...and it turned out the person
I was talking to was Mike Markkula.

223
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:14,384
Mike proceeded to talk to us about
the program over the coming months...

224
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:17,784
...we put together agreements
and whatnot, and in the end...

225
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,788
...he grabbed one of the first machines
to come off the line...

226
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:24,292
...put it in a bag, jumped on an airplane
and brought it to Minneapolis.

227
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:25,963
This was that machine.

228
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:30,901
And you'll notice that the bag
does not have a bite out of the apple.

229
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:34,666
I don't know if that was a mistake on the
part of the people who produced it...

230
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:39,811
...or more likely, that it was produced
early on, before Apple decided...

231
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,479
...taking the bite out of the apple...

232
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,478
...would make it more registerable,
if that's a word.

233
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:53,084
And this is the original brochure...

234
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:56,625
...that came with the Apple II,
or for the Apple II.

235
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,592
It's very simple,
has an apple on the cover.

236
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:01,823
And if you'll notice
on the wall beside us...

237
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:05,595
...there is a photo
that looks suspiciously familiar.

238
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:10,434
That is one of three photos
that was ever produced in photo form.

239
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:13,703
I was given one for Christmas
by Mike Markkula...

240
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:17,110
...I'm told that their banker
at the Bank of America got one...

241
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,307
...and that there was
a third one at Apple.

242
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:21,145
And to my knowledge...

243
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:25,483
...there are probably only one or two
in existence any longer today.

244
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:30,023
You'll notice many of the things here
on the original brochure.

245
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:34,029
One was that they came
with cassette tapes to load the programs.

246
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:37,696
For a long time, we sold
Apple cassette-tape machines...

247
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:41,236
...to sell with the machine because
they couldn't get them otherwise.

248
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,408
Remember, the computer
was fairly expensive.

249
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,737
In fact, I happen to have
an October 1977 price list.

250
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,244
And a computer system
with 16K of RAM...

251
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,382
...which was what
we typically sold it at...

252
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,017
...was $1698.

253
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:56,949
Now, you can have
a good chuckle today...

254
00:15:57,156 --> 00:16:01,024
...16K was $540.

255
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:04,821
So to outfit a machine completely
would take you up to about $40,000.

256
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:09,364
These are the pieces of software
that were available originally with it.

257
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:12,435
There was a checkbook,
home-management cassette.

258
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:16,199
There was the Breakout game,
which was a little bit like Pong...

259
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:19,866
...a <i>Star Trek</i> game
and high-res graphics routines.

260
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,707
And that was what you could get with it
at this point in time.

261
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:24,576
That was every piece of software
Apple had.

262
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,117
And then this is the real deal.

263
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,812
This is the real deal.
It's a used computer.

264
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:35,585
It was actually used, but here's the key.

265
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:38,420
There's the serial number.

266
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,428
And as you can see,
this was serial number five.

267
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,567
Fifth machine
to ever come down the line...

268
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:46,761
...assuming they put stickers
on one through four.

269
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:52,604
This machine was in regular use
probably up until...

270
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:56,310
Well, it was in regular use past
the introduction of the Macintosh...

271
00:16:56,515 --> 00:17:00,849
...so probably up until 1984 or '80...
No, '86 or '87.

272
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:03,112
- this machine was in regular use.

273
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:05,889
That's what you came
all this way to see.

274
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:09,219
So basically you had this
before anybody else did.

275
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:12,261
Yes, we...

276
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:15,831
I guess I have to say
I identified the potential of the product.

277
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:21,029
We were the first dealer/distributor
that Apple ever had.

278
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,677
I wrote Apple's first distributor
agreement, which was liberally plager...

279
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:29,473
I mean, inspired by
a Pioneer car-stereo agreement...

280
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:31,615
...went through
and defined the terms...

281
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:34,752
...and what would be done
and sent it back.

282
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:37,820
And Apple had their lawyers
take a look at it and we signed it.

283
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:41,459
And we were the first-ever Apple dealer.

284
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:07,378
The Macintosh began with Jeff.
Jeff Raskin was a professor at UCSD.

285
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:12,951
Jeff was a music professor
as well as a computer professor.

286
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:18,094
Jeff was hired at Apple
to start the Pubs Department at Apple.

287
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,458
Jeff is a great writer. Was always...

288
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:24,158
Just had a great sense of humor,
was really articulate...

289
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:26,803
...had a great rebel attitude.

290
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:29,769
In... I believe February '79
was the very beginning...

291
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:33,809
...of the Mac project, where he
approached Mike Markkula to ask...

292
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:37,914
To talk about his ideas about a low-cost,
easy-to-use computer.

293
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,382
And so he started writing
a series of papers...

294
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:44,579
...later became called, I guess,
the Macintosh Papers.

295
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,248
And then around the fall of '79, he...

296
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,054
Mike Markkula was impressed enough
with the papers...

297
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:54,494
...that he gave him some budget
to pursue starting a project.

298
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:58,964
Jeff needed hardware for a prototype.

299
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:02,470
Jeff had sort of the basic idea
of the hardware spec'd out.

300
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:04,699
He had the notion
of the bitmap display...

301
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,845
...which was, of course,
crucial to it being a Macintosh.

302
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:11,644
But anyway, he needed to find
a hardware designer...

303
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:16,077
...and Bill Atkinson ran into Burrell,
who was working in Service Department.

304
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,616
Bill had seen glimmers
of Burrell's genius.

305
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,349
He introduced him to Jeff as:

306
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,154
"Here's the guy who could design
your Macintosh for you."

307
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,763
Jeff said, at the first...
"We'll see about that."

308
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:29,058
Jeff was very proud of himself.

309
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:30,235
But he quickly...

310
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:34,872
To Jeff's credit, he quickly saw
Burrell was the man to do the job.

311
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:37,098
The project really took on reality...

312
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:40,403
...when Burrell did his first design
over Christmas vacation...

313
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:42,773
...at the very, very end of the decade.

314
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:47,008
I think that's a notable point about
the Mac that writers don't really make.

315
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:50,620
It was really born with the 1980s...

316
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:55,782
...because it was designed
right at the cusp of the decade ending.

317
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:58,519
But meanwhile, once he got that going...

318
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:02,222
...Steve Jobs got wind of it,
as well as other people at Apple, that...

319
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:08,066
...boy, here's this board that is
one-third the price of the Lisa...

320
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:10,036
...that's twice as fast. That's amazing.

321
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:15,038
The most common inspiration, clearly,
was the Apple II.

322
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:17,408
Steve Jobs was even
explicit about that...

323
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:21,552
...telling us we were reincarnating
the Apple II for the '80s.

324
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:26,520
I realized, as we were trying
to complete the software...

325
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:31,719
...that, boy, the Mac was so heavily
graphics-based...

326
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:36,367
...we needed someone who was
a world-class graphic designer.

327
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:42,035
I had basically asked Susan
to come as my date...

328
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,334
...to a few of the
Macintosh parties we had.

329
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:46,977
That was kind of the first connection.

330
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,579
And she met some of the team
and really liked them...

331
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:51,612
...and so I proposed that she work on it.

332
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:54,445
But the Mac prototypes
were too rare to get her one.

333
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:57,417
So I first started her off
with graph paper.

334
00:20:57,623 --> 00:21:00,387
Went and just bought
some pretty fine graph paper...

335
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:04,528
...and told her to make drawings
by filling in the squares or not.

336
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:08,894
And she did some fantastic work,
doing some drawings that way...

337
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,830
...that I think I still have somewhere.

338
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:13,630
And so I showed them to people
on the team and they said:

339
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,306
"Boy, yeah, she's good."

340
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:18,943
Jeff made one other key hire,
a woman named Joanna Hoffman...

341
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:21,339
...who became the Macintosh's
first marketing person.

342
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,079
She has a great story about being
interviewed by Jeff...

343
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,548
...while Jeff was at his piano keyboard.

344
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:31,416
And when he liked something she said,
he'd play a happy little melody.

345
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:36,686
If he didn't like it so much,
he'd express his reactions musically.

346
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:40,956
And those original Mac team members,
to this day, are my best friends...

347
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:45,500
...my extended family.
I would do anything for them.

348
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:49,605
Apple, consciously or not...

349
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:54,745
...positioned itself
as an alternative to IBM...

350
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:59,246
...which represented the establishment,
the government, big corporations.

351
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:04,650
In 1977, Apple,
a young, fledgling company...

352
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:09,486
...invents the Apple II, the first
personal computer as we know it today.

353
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:15,964
IBM dismisses the personal computer
as too small to do serious computing...

354
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,534
...and unimportant to their business.

355
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:24,232
And this was at a time...
Post-Watergate, late '70s.

356
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:27,535
- people were suspicious of the
government and what it represented.

357
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:32,007
And the PC, the personal computer,
was a revolution in computing.

358
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:33,912
And at the time,
there was a utopian mindset.

359
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:39,683
The idea that technology, especially
personal-computer technology...

360
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:43,492
...would enable people to throw off
the shackles of society...

361
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:47,791
...and foment a technological revolution.

362
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,863
IBM enters
the personal-computer market...

363
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:55,005
...in November '81 with the IBM PC.

364
00:22:56,875 --> 00:23:00,936
It is now 1984.

365
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:05,776
It appears IBM wants it all.

366
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:10,512
Will Big Blue dominate
the entire computer industry?

367
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:13,953
The entire Information Age?

368
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,619
Was George Orwell right about 1984?

369
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:14,880
He made a lot of money out of Apple...

370
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:18,749
...but he dropped out of Silicon Valley
and he taught high school for 10 years.

371
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,687
He volunteered in, you know,
the local high school...

372
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:24,384
...to teach kids engineering
and computer science.

373
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:30,226
When Apple lost Steve,
they lost their way, to some extent.

374
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:34,633
They became a shadow
of what they were.

375
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:39,810
You know, the first half of the '90s,
they were sort of all over the place.

376
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:43,913
They didn't know exactly
what the best thing for them to do was.

377
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:48,317
Didn't know if they were supposed
to be licensing the operating system...

378
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,047
...or if they should be making the Newton
and trying to do the next big thing.

379
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:56,557
Well, I think the main thing that
touched most people was at the time...

380
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:59,662
...all the press was bad about Apple.
Apple's gonna die...

381
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:01,662
...Macintosh's market share
was slipping.

382
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:03,698
There's no software,
there's no hardware.

383
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:05,335
Everything was coming unglued.

384
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:09,605
My first job at Apple
was software evangelist.

385
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:14,472
So my duties were to find developers
or meet with developers...

386
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:17,876
...and convince them to write
Macintosh versions of their software...

387
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:22,076
...as well as hardware manufacturers,
to create peripherals.

388
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:25,620
So it was basically
to proselytize Macintosh...

389
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:28,292
...to the third-party-developer
community.

390
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:32,293
Well, the first time I was there, we were
going to change the world, all right?

391
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:34,761
We're bringing out Macintosh
for the first time...

392
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:36,991
...no one's ever seen it,
changing the world.

393
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:41,767
The second time, obviously,
the world had been changed.

394
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:45,702
Perhaps the world had been changed
by adopting Windows too.

395
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:49,347
So the second time
was much more dire...

396
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:54,144
...sort of digging yourself out of a hole.

397
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:57,048
The first time was just...

398
00:25:57,255 --> 00:26:00,816
It was like being paid
to go to Disneyland.

399
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:06,060
Second time was more like,
you know, Vietnam.

400
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:09,432
Although I wasn't in Vietnam,
so that kind of trivializes it...

401
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:12,102
...but, you know, it was a war.

402
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:16,866
The second tour of duty came
when Apple was supposed to die again.

403
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:20,238
So every 10 years ago,
Apple's supposed to die.

404
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:23,744
And I went back at the height, or depth...

405
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:28,443
...of these problems.

406
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:32,851
Basically to ensure
that the Macintosh cult...

407
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:37,256
...remained vibrant and alive
and cared for.

408
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:41,364
And so because I couldn't really
control any medium...

409
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:44,797
...I started an e-mail list server...

410
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:48,564
...which had at its peak
about 44,000 subscribers.

411
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:51,708
And it was only good news.

412
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:54,771
So one could make the case
that I was blogging...

413
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,505
...before anybody else
knew what blogging was.

414
00:26:57,716 --> 00:27:01,277
I just didn't know it.
So I had a very big list.

415
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:05,616
Forty-four thousand for, you know...
Even today, 44,000 would be a big list...

416
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:10,193
...but it was very big back then.
And I would just push out good news.

417
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:12,829
And it became a source of information...

418
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:16,432
...so that software developers would
send us notices and special offers...

419
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,603
...and all that, then we'd push it
out to the community.

420
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,829
And the community would then
push it out to the rest of the people.

421
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:27,444
A Guy Kawasaki law
is sales fixes everything.

422
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:31,480
So when you have great sales,
everybody gets along. Life is good.

423
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:35,210
Everybody's a visionary. You know,
everybody thinks it's good, right?

424
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,048
When sales sucks, everything sucks.

425
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:40,224
So sales were sucking.

426
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:42,916
So Apple was divided into factions.

427
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:46,063
There was the Jean-Louis Gassée
faction and the Bill Campbell faction.

428
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:52,796
Campbell believed in marketing, Gassée
believed in engineering. Pick one.

429
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:55,365
And that kind of tore the company apart.

430
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,472
And the reason why I survived all this...

431
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:03,546
...is because I never
really joined either camp.

432
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:05,113
Now, you could make the case...

433
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:07,648
...that that means
that I was this neutral wimp...

434
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:11,754
...but I just...
I didn't see the world divided that way.

435
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:15,858
And so I got along with Sculley
and I got along with Jobs.

436
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:19,258
I got along with Amelio.
I got along with everybody.

437
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:24,197
One of the reasons is because
I'd never wanted any of their jobs.

438
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:30,838
All right? So Sculley wanted to be Steve.
Gassée wanted to be Sculley.

439
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:34,270
Bill Campbell wanted to be...
I don't know who he wanted to be.

440
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:38,779
But, you know, that's one of the things
that's pathetic about Silicon Valley...

441
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:41,417
...is everybody wants to be
something they're not.

442
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:44,952
And if you're the venture capitalist,
you wanna be the entrepreneur.

443
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:47,420
Me, I just wanna be
a hockey player, okay?

444
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:49,855
So everybody wants to be
something they're not.

445
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:54,020
And at the time,
that was rampant at Apple.

446
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:47,650
When I got started was 1979...

447
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:51,117
...when I took spare parts
and built an Apple II.

448
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:56,961
I tried to figure out how I could attach
musical instruments to the computer...

449
00:29:57,162 --> 00:30:00,598
...which led to why I needed to
learn how to write code...

450
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,962
...which led to quitting college...

451
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:07,764
...which then led to getting a job...

452
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:12,671
...and then over the years,
that turned into getting hired at Apple.

453
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:16,941
I was sort of informally
in the QuickTime group as I was...

454
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:20,379
...a formal member of the OS team...

455
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:23,645
...although I didn't really
report too well into that group.

456
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:27,985
We were always kind of a renegade
kind of a group. But we got shit done.

457
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:31,651
But the work was the Sound Manager,
which was this complete rewrite...

458
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:33,990
...that ended up
fixing a lot of problems...

459
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:36,690
...and imported it from all this
nasty assembly code...

460
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:40,029
...and rewrote it in C, and made it
actually go like 10 times faster.

461
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:43,471
And then right about the same time
we got the Sound Manager working...

462
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:47,001
...I started working
inside of the moonlight hours...

463
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:51,410
...over in the forbidden zone of what
the QuickTime guys were doing.

464
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:53,447
They were hiding out
in the Networking building.

465
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,219
And the original idea was,
"Now we got these CD-ROMs.

466
00:30:57,422 --> 00:31:01,119
They're not just bigger floppies.
What can we do with them?"

467
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:04,026
I know. Let's make movies.

468
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:06,629
And so that's where the postage-stamp
movie idea came from...

469
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:10,631
...was you couldn't put one on a floppy,
but you could put one on a CD-ROM.

470
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:13,296
So, you know,
taking advantage of the new media.

471
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:15,335
So that was the basic idea
for QuickTime.

472
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,906
And then that invented
all these other ideas...

473
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:20,942
...of how do you compress audio,
how do you compress video...

474
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:23,978
...how do you stream it, how do you
play it, how do you synchronize it...

475
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:27,379
...how do you do all these things
in real time, how do you control it?

476
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:29,883
And then QuickTime turned into
this entire industry...

477
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:32,113
...based upon that basic idea.

478
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:35,952
The people on the outside think that,
you know...

479
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:39,295
...it's like this wonderful world of
Oz or Disney going on...

480
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:42,227
...and all of us are just all these
brilliant, amazing, happy people.

481
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:44,492
And it's not.
It's like a sausage factory, man.

482
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:46,897
You really don't wanna know
how this stuff happens.

483
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:50,506
A lot of it is just bad arguments
and politics...

484
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:54,974
...and working around the rules
and not doing the right thing...

485
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:59,115
...and apologizing for it later,
getting fired a few times.

486
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:00,750
I mean, that's how things got done.

487
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:04,319
It's definitely, like, don't pay attention
to the man behind the curtain.

488
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:05,784
There's a lot of that stuff.

489
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:08,584
And you really don't wanna know
how this stuff is built.

490
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:10,283
To me, it's embarrassing, like...

491
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:13,726
...there's always big flaws
to a lot of the stuff, you know?

492
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:19,632
There was a computer that we shipped
where the speaker's magnet...

493
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:22,806
...was right next to the hard drive.

494
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:27,744
Now, when you played a sound...

495
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:33,043
...it caused
the hard drive's read-write head...

496
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:35,776
...to misalign.

497
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:39,388
So in the midst of, like,
playing your QuickTime movie...

498
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:43,117
...your computer would completely freeze
because it played a sound.

499
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:46,661
And I'm like, "What kind of engineers
do we have around here...

500
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:49,628
...that would put a magnet
right next to your hard drive?"

501
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:53,702
Jesus Christ, it's just a...
It beeped and it crashed, you know?

502
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:55,998
Then they wanted me...
This was the solution.

503
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:59,870
They wanted me to change the decibels
of the speaker...

504
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:02,308
...so that it wouldn't interfere
with the hard drive.

505
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:03,673
You're kidding me.

506
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:06,941
That's classic. See, you know,
engineers are retarded.

507
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,051
They have
some kind of brain damage...

508
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:12,347
...that allows them
to not have social skills...

509
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:15,287
...so that they could concentrate
long enough to write code.

510
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,723
But it's a disease.

511
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:21,127
That's why I had to quit. I mean,
I'm like an engineer in recovery.

512
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,959
I don't wanna write code anymore.

513
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,759
It just makes you retarded.

514
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:27,096
I mean, get a girlfriend.

515
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:29,296
Get a life.

516
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:40,910
There were times
when it was more difficult...

517
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:43,519
...you know, when Microsoft
was at its strongest.

518
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:46,588
Yeah, when I think about comparing
Microsoft and Apple...

519
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:49,316
...I think about the basic values
of the company...

520
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,620
...being almost diametrically opposed.

521
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:53,990
They have managed
to distinguished themselves...

522
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,393
...as the company that isn't Microsoft.

523
00:33:57,101 --> 00:34:00,161
And I think there's a lot of Mac users
who choose to use a Mac...

524
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:03,568
...for that reason,
that isn't a Windows machine.

525
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:07,342
I've used Windows to the extent
that I've had to use Windows.

526
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:14,178
And I just cannot understand
some stuff there.

527
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:16,746
I've hated Windows
for a number of years...

528
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:18,080
...and I could never figure out why.

529
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,991
And about three years ago, it finally
hit me that the reason I hated it...

530
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:24,252
...was because
it always makes me feel stupid.

531
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:25,486
I go to do something...

532
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:28,529
...it gives me a warning
that I don't understand, it's cryptic.

533
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:35,471
But, you know, Microsoft was one of
the first big developers for Apple.

534
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:38,506
I mean, they made a fortune
developing software for Apple.

535
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:42,110
And also for the Mac. They're one
of the first big Mac developers as well.

536
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:44,713
As far as the PC users...

537
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:49,844
...and Mac users being compared?

538
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:54,991
I really feel that there is a lot of
give-and-take in the PC users' world...

539
00:34:55,193 --> 00:35:00,631
...but that the PC users really get off
on how complicated it is.

540
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:02,390
It makes them feel superior...

541
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,433
...when they sit down with somebody
and totally confuse them.

542
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:08,196
And, you know,
not every PC user is like that...

543
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:11,034
...but the ones that I have talked to...

544
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:14,302
...basically just love to rattle on
technical information...

545
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:17,777
...at a mile a minute
because it makes them look good.

546
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:21,483
Everything that, you know,
went into Office, I think were initially...

547
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:24,780
...purchased from other companies
and developed for the Mac.

548
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:27,457
And then, of course, you know,
rolled into Windows.

549
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:29,353
And then they... You know, I mean...

550
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,894
...Bill Gates saw that the Mac
operating system was the way to go.

551
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:36,931
And Windows, you know, 3.1
borrowed heavily from that...

552
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,399
...and then Windows 95, 10 years later.

553
00:35:40,204 --> 00:35:41,933
The rest is history.

554
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:57,921
To start us off in the right direction
is an individual...

555
00:35:58,122 --> 00:36:01,216
...who really needs little introduction.

556
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:13,532
After all... After all...

557
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:17,765
Steve Jobs has been around
since the very first Macintosh.

558
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:22,438
So please join with me now
and welcome, from Apple Computer...

559
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:23,739
...Steve Jobs.

560
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:32,115
Thank you.

561
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:38,362
The last several weeks, we have
looked at some of the relationships.

562
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:41,464
And I'd like to announce
one of our first partnerships today...

563
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:43,429
...a very, very meaningful one.

564
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:46,068
And that is one with Microsoft.

565
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:50,332
One of the things that I hear
over and over again...

566
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,566
...always from Windows people,
of course...

567
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:55,746
...is that Microsoft saved Apple
from certain doom...

568
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:58,745
...by giving them $150 million.

569
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:02,317
Well, if you look at the whole story,
Steve negotiated agreement...

570
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:06,320
...where Microsoft agreed to produce
Office for another five years.

571
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:08,151
Apple wasn't gonna compete
with them.

572
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:10,623
At the same time,
Microsoft made an investment...

573
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:15,026
...of $150 million in Apple stock
that particular day.

574
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,700
That served two purposes:

575
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:22,635
One, it made it look like Microsoft
was confident in Apple's survival...

576
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,673
...because they wouldn't have
bought stock if they didn't.

577
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:29,073
And secondly,
it kind of cemented the agreement that...

578
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,716
...we're not only sure you're
gonna be successful with this product...

579
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:36,114
...we're gonna back it up
by buying some stock so we're part of it.

580
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,686
We're not only a competitor
in producing software...

581
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:41,380
...we're a partner and owning stock.

582
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,150
What most people don't tell you...

583
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:46,626
...is that they didn't need the money
from Microsoft to survive...

584
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:48,355
...this was all a marketing game.

585
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:50,796
And a lot of Windows people
don't understand that.

586
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:53,027
Microsoft didn't save Apple.

587
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:55,603
And if we wanna move forward...

588
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:58,707
...and see Apple healthy
and prospering again...

589
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:00,877
...we have to let go of a few things here.

590
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:04,514
We have to let go of this notion
that for Apple to win...

591
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:07,741
...Microsoft has to lose, okay?

592
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:14,123
We have to embrace the notion
that for Apple to win...

593
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:15,986
...Apple has to do a really good job.

594
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:23,992
What makes companies
very successful...

595
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:27,358
...and what makes companies fail
is the same thing.

596
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:33,162
It's sort of the passionate adherence
to a strategy.

597
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:37,239
People who are passionately involved
in a concept or philosophy...

598
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:42,606
...a design, a product, all right,
will put everything of themselves into it.

599
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:47,577
And you don't want somebody designing
a product who isn't passionate about it.

600
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:50,481
Innovation is...

601
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:55,921
It's really the only interesting thing.
If you're not innovating, what's the point?

602
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:59,096
When Apple creates through engineering
something very cool...

603
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:01,764
...that people want to buy, it does well.

604
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:04,230
And when it doesn't, it doesn't.

605
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:08,098
So, you know, guess what.
Newton didn't succeed.

606
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:12,298
Apple III didn't succeed.
Lisa didn't succeed.

607
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:15,579
If you stand back and you look at
the Macintosh, the Macintosh line...

608
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,578
...everything they implement
into their computers has personality.

609
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:22,985
It's like the difference
between owning a Ferrari...

610
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:26,987
...versus owning, you know,
just a Ford Taurus.

611
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:30,957
You know, it's sleeker style, design,
it's fun to drive...

612
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:33,922
...you know, versus one
that you just use to get to work.

613
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:39,068
So Macintosh was the mega hit,
but what was the first company...

614
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:42,831
...that really made CD-ROM drives
on every computer?

615
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,134
Guess what. It was Apple.

616
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:49,710
Guess who democratized 802.11.

617
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:52,741
AirPort and Apple, right?

618
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:58,186
And so how about FireWire?
Who made that a standard?

619
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:00,220
How about USB?

620
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:03,291
Some companies can think
you can innovate too fast...

621
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:07,089
...because you don't sort of
milk the cash cow...

622
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,095
...to the maximum before moving on.

623
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,461
That's not the way Apple usually thinks.

624
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,767
So after a while, it's not just the big hit,
it's also...

625
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:17,770
You know, you can say
that these revolutions...

626
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:23,038
...were caused by little uprisings
that Apple, you know, made successful.

627
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:24,737
The mouse.

628
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:27,383
Now, someone could say,
"Well, PARC had the mouse"...

629
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:31,180
...and all that, but, you know, PARC
didn't make it a commercial success.

630
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,145
Apple sort of...

631
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:35,951
and it basically comes from
both Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak,

632
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,128
they don't really care about that.

633
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:41,890
Sure, they wanna make money,
but that's not what it's about.

634
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:43,657
It's artistic values.

635
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:46,735
Apple wants to do
the greatest thing possible.

636
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:50,429
They don't compare themselves
to someone else. Who cares about...?

637
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:53,235
Other people can do great things too.
That's great.

638
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:57,642
It's more, like, you know,
being transcendently brilliant.

639
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:01,215
No matter how well you've done it,
how can you make it better?

640
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,653
I would like to hear
what Jonathan Ive would say.

641
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:10,184
His design is so inspired.

642
00:42:10,394 --> 00:42:13,454
It's like it's divine providence
or something.

643
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:17,031
He has a team of, like,
phenomenally talented people...

644
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:19,202
...and they keep working on a problem...

645
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:21,803
...until they come up
with something fresh and new.

646
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:26,636
You know, like the scroll wheel
on the iPod or that Luxo-Iooking iMac.

647
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:30,336
If you look at what Apple does,
after it does it...

648
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,539
...one thing you always have to say is:

649
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:35,548
"How come nobody else
did this before?" Right?

650
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:41,123
There's nothing, like, mythical
about the iPod and the wheel, right?

651
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:42,622
Anybody could have done that.

652
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:48,025
You know, the colored iMacs
changed design in everything.

653
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:50,862
You know
even on the lids of PowerBooks...

654
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:52,831
...you know,
they open up very smoothly...

655
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:56,097
...because they have
this weird counterbalancing system...

656
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:59,435
...and no one is ever gonna see this.

657
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:03,443
It's not something that consumers
will actually go out and buy.

658
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:10,110
So wouldn't you think that some
of these computer companies would say:

659
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:14,785
"Apple does well
because it has beautiful products.

660
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:20,726
So how much could the most expensive
industrial designer in the world cost?"

661
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:24,658
You know, a million dollars
a year in salary?

662
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:27,359
Two million dollars a year?
Five million dollars?

663
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:29,732
That's what makes these products
so beautiful...

664
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:34,172
...that level of commitment
and dedication to the thing...

665
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:36,209
...to make it the best thing possible.

666
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:42,010
I'll tell you what, I'll take you to Fry's
and I will you show you lines of crap.

667
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:48,818
Ugly portables, ugly towers,
ugly monitors, ugly MP3 players.

668
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:50,789
Why is that?

669
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:53,122
I guess in a sense,
it proves the point...

670
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:55,764
...that these people
don't know what to steal.

671
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,797
They don't know what to steal.

672
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:10,510
They seem to be all kinds
of different people.

673
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:13,649
You think that the prototypical Mac
users seem to be...

674
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:16,843
...like the graphic designer, you know,
who lives in New York...

675
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:21,753
...or San Francisco, is liberal,
you know, young, sort of hip.

676
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:25,395
You know,
there's a lot of different age groups...

677
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:28,030
...a lot of different income brackets.

678
00:44:28,232 --> 00:44:30,257
A lot of people
who are in a lot of different jobs...

679
00:44:30,467 --> 00:44:32,128
...a lot of different professions.

680
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:36,739
Although Apple would like you to think
that everybody is a young buck...

681
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,771
...that's 20 years old that has a Mac...

682
00:44:38,976 --> 00:44:41,410
...the truth is
most of the user group members...

683
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:45,446
...are between 55
and a hundred years old.

684
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:49,407
Well, I think the Apple community
has stayed remarkably consistent.

685
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:53,215
It's people who love good engineering,
they love product design.

686
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:56,154
They love being different.
No pun intended.

687
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,124
They love probably being the underdog.

688
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:02,355
But then you ask marketers... You know,
there are marketing guys...

689
00:45:02,566 --> 00:45:05,535
...and they're convinced
that Apple is a brand.

690
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:10,969
And it conjures up brand associations
of creativity and liberty, freedom.

691
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:14,110
And people are buying into the brand,
the way they buy a Coke...

692
00:45:14,311 --> 00:45:17,075
...or beer or a car or a pair of sneakers.

693
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:20,079
It says something about them
and their personality.

694
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:22,809
So I think people might be
a little more attracted...

695
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:26,251
...to the rebelliousness of it.

696
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:30,951
I mean, you're the anti crowd anyway
because you don't have a PC, right?

697
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:45,339
For a lot of people, it's a revelation when
they go to Macworld to see other Mac users.

698
00:45:45,542 --> 00:45:48,978
It's amazing. They never knew
all these people were out there.

699
00:45:51,815 --> 00:45:54,340
Yeah, actually,
I went to my first Macworld this year...

700
00:45:54,551 --> 00:45:56,610
...which turned out to be
a good one to go to.

701
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:59,050
That was when
they introduced the iPhone.

702
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:02,623
So actually, what I wanna do...
Switch over to Danny.

703
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:03,884
Hey, Danny.

704
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:06,790
People take their vacations
at Macworld.

705
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:10,626
That'll be like a weeks' vacation
just to go to Macworld.

706
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:12,930
Probably 15th.

707
00:46:13,137 --> 00:46:17,198
I missed last year and Janet and I,
my wife, we really regretted it...

708
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:21,673
...because we really like coming here
and meeting with people.

709
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:26,248
You know, I've seen people show up
with these giant suitcases.

710
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:30,045
These huge suitcases,
you know, the ones on wheels, empty.

711
00:46:30,254 --> 00:46:33,155
Just for all the crap
they're gonna collect at Macworld.

712
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:36,087
All that leaflets
and the freebies and the buttons.

713
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:40,196
I did get my T-shirt, yeah.
That I made sure of.

714
00:46:41,265 --> 00:46:43,961
It's just like being on a casino floor
at Las Vegas.

715
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:46,864
You know, without the cigarette smoke
or the drinks.

716
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:49,834
So you're horribly sober
and people are barging into you...

717
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,941
...and screaming and shrieking.

718
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:54,935
You know, I've been at Macworld...

719
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,943
...and Jobs will whip out, you know,
some new machine.

720
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,979
And my God,
I've gotta have that machine.

721
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:02,015
Even though I've already got
six computers.

722
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:03,982
I've gotta have that one
he's just unveiled.

723
00:47:04,188 --> 00:47:07,646
Why? Because it's faster,
or it's got a silver case...

724
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:09,792
...or it's got,
you know, Bluetooth built-in...

725
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,984
...or something
just crazy and stupid, really.

726
00:47:12,196 --> 00:47:14,357
But I got to have that machine.

727
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:35,309
So just before Apple
is about to open a brand-new store...

728
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:37,146
...a lot of people
will camp out outside...

729
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:39,618
...just for the honor
of being the first inside.

730
00:47:39,823 --> 00:47:42,485
There are lot of people who
are really passionate about it.

731
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,854
When they opened up the Apple store,
I went out...

732
00:47:45,062 --> 00:47:48,896
...there was 3-, 400 people who camped
out overnight to get into the store.

733
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:51,727
And then by the time they opened it,
there was several thousand.

734
00:47:51,935 --> 00:47:54,335
I figure, 2-, 3-, 4000 people.

735
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:58,065
And they were wrapped around
the block, you know, a couple of times.

736
00:47:58,275 --> 00:48:02,211
And before Apple had Mac stores,
you know, across the country...

737
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:06,371
...a lot of people would go hang out
at their, like, mom-and-pop Apple store.

738
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:10,519
People would come in
with their broken down computer...

739
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:14,088
...intending just to drop it off,
but they'd end up staying all day.

740
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:16,725
They start bullshiting,
talking to the other people...

741
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:19,327
...they would meet
other people who are like...

742
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:20,757
They don't have anything in common...

743
00:48:20,964 --> 00:48:22,556
...except they're Mac users
and that's enough.

744
00:48:22,766 --> 00:48:24,700
You know, to cement it for them.

745
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:31,136
Yeah, this is a ma-and-pa business,
absolutely.

746
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:33,536
And I couldn't have three stores
without them.

747
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:38,214
One of my stores is managed
by my oldest son who's 27.

748
00:48:39,616 --> 00:48:41,584
He manages the Ventura store.

749
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:46,714
My wife manages this store
while I manage the Woodland Hills store.

750
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:49,484
I have two daughters
who are teenagers.

751
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:52,025
Jessica works here regularly...

752
00:48:52,229 --> 00:48:55,289
...Kayla comes over
and kind of participates.

753
00:48:55,499 --> 00:49:00,402
My little boy, he works here daily.
He mans the little kid's station.

754
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:03,198
This is definitely his operation.

755
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:08,606
You know, he captures the attention
of most women and all kids.

756
00:49:10,213 --> 00:49:12,841
At one point,
I became a real Mac person because...

757
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:15,848
- I'm not sure how it happened, but...
- Okay. How are you doing?

758
00:49:16,053 --> 00:49:19,352
They were just computers
and all of a sudden I realized...

759
00:49:19,556 --> 00:49:22,684
...you know, I am a Mac advocate.
I do push this stuff.

760
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:25,623
Not just trying to sell it
because it's my business...

761
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:28,559
...but because they work well.
I don't bang my head on them.

762
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:30,494
Stop it, that's not nice.

763
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:34,800
So here's what's happening,
there is a sound mike right there.

764
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:38,236
- Every time you talk, you interfere with it.
- It's in there.

765
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:40,103
Sorry.

766
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:45,312
- This was my first foray into retail.
- Look how cute I am.

767
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:47,311
Successful?

768
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:50,816
I'm putting everything back into it,
working to make it successful.

769
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:53,387
So this started out just as an idea.

770
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:55,751
I'm trying to figure out new ways
to advertise.

771
00:49:55,959 --> 00:49:59,395
First I tossed it out to the guys
in the Apple specialist group.

772
00:49:59,596 --> 00:50:02,224
And I got
maybe three or four responses...

773
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:04,992
...from people
who have done similar things.

774
00:50:05,302 --> 00:50:08,430
I didn't see any pictures
of full-car wraps.

775
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:11,630
But I looked on the web
and I saw all kinds of cars...

776
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:14,572
...that were wrapped
with full-body designs, and I liked it.

777
00:50:14,778 --> 00:50:16,803
It seemed like it could work.

778
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:20,677
I'm trying to become a retailer
and learning new things about it.

779
00:50:20,884 --> 00:50:23,978
The big box guys don't entertain me
when I go into their stores...

780
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:26,018
...but they've got mountains of product.

781
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:29,420
They've got negotiating power,
the likes of which I can never imagine.

782
00:50:29,626 --> 00:50:33,323
But hopefully we give
a little bit better experience.

783
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,555
Ninety percent of the things I do
doesn't work.

784
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:38,234
Hopefully, the 10 percent that works...

785
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:42,064
It seems like it's paying for itself.
Pushing things forward, so...

786
00:50:42,272 --> 00:50:44,331
I'm gonna keep on trying.

787
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:48,709
People like us keep the machines
around for so much longer.

788
00:50:48,912 --> 00:50:51,403
I mean, I don't think
PC owners really do that.

789
00:50:51,615 --> 00:50:52,980
But, you know, a Mac user...

790
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:55,208
They'll keep
an old machine around forever...

791
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:57,216
...if it's lights are still running.

792
00:50:57,421 --> 00:51:00,822
We've all got old Macs,
like, you can't bear to throw away...

793
00:51:01,024 --> 00:51:03,891
...in a basement,
or in a cupboard somewhere in the attic.

794
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:07,552
They're hard to part with. You figure
one day you're gonna dust them off...

795
00:51:07,764 --> 00:51:09,595
...do something with them.
You never do.

796
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:13,167
They just sit, rotting away.
There's a lot of people that collect them.

797
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:15,895
But some of them are more serious
than others.

798
00:51:17,941 --> 00:51:19,340
Okay.

799
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:24,612
Up first, this is our G3 monitor.
Very rare.

800
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:27,045
When this came in...
A friend of mine brought it in.

801
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,842
- it's the first time I'd ever seen it.

802
00:51:29,052 --> 00:51:33,546
I didn't even know that Apple made it,
but it was... Got the Apple logo on it.

803
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,816
And it was made for the G3 tower.

804
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:37,927
This is Apple's entry...

805
00:51:38,128 --> 00:51:43,725
- It's got the Apple logo on it - 
into the portable printer...

806
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:45,265
You recognize, these?

807
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:48,728
Black with the Bell + Howell
name on them.

808
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:51,871
Apple made it for Bell + Howell.

809
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:55,010
And they were mainly education.

810
00:52:00,016 --> 00:52:04,316
I started buying a couple
of these machines from people I know.

811
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:06,887
And then refurbishing them.

812
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:13,359
Here's my II Plus that I purchased
originally, way back when.

813
00:52:13,563 --> 00:52:16,896
I replaced my Apple II Plus
with an Apple IIc.

814
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:21,566
I should've thrown the II Plus away,
but never did.

815
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:24,171
No, this is like
our conference room that is...

816
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:28,606
I ran out of space to fix my laptops,
so I started fixing them in here.

817
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:33,977
I didn't wanna see a nice room
go to waste, so I put more stuff in it.

818
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:38,780
In education, this is probably one of
the biggest ones, these <i>Microzines</i>.

819
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:42,755
Where it's like a magazine
and a diskette.

820
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:44,654
Almost every school had these.

821
00:52:48,365 --> 00:52:53,268
Here's my 20th anniversary
and everybody's favorite, the Cube.

822
00:52:53,803 --> 00:52:56,271
Here's a cool machine, Mac mini.

823
00:52:56,473 --> 00:52:59,772
They hit a home run
when they made this.

824
00:53:00,577 --> 00:53:02,442
Here's something that's...

825
00:53:02,646 --> 00:53:05,308
Three-and-a-half-inch diskettes,
still shrink-wrapped.

826
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:09,281
They have the old, old, old Apple logo.

827
00:53:09,486 --> 00:53:13,115
Apple's had several different logos
over the years.

828
00:53:13,323 --> 00:53:15,553
And that's one of the old ones.

829
00:53:16,393 --> 00:53:21,126
You may think it's an Apple IIe,
but when you take this cover off...

830
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:24,664
...you may still think it's an Apple IIe,
but it's not.

831
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:29,635
Apple IIGS before the IIGS cases
were made.

832
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,403
Anything interesting over here?

833
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:35,043
No.

834
00:53:35,912 --> 00:53:37,379
And the I bought a IIe.

835
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:40,448
Then I bought a IIe
with a numeric keypad.

836
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:43,084
I should've been throwing these away,
but never did...

837
00:53:43,286 --> 00:53:45,049
...so maybe that was my training.

838
00:53:46,456 --> 00:53:48,822
Junk. That's a long name for junk.

839
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:54,925
Back here, we made some kind
of attempt at putting things on shelves.

840
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:57,123
Dual drives.

841
00:53:57,334 --> 00:54:01,498
The Apple 51/4s. The Apple 31/2s.

842
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:05,471
Some Apple printers.
Apple keyboards, Apple mice.

843
00:54:07,611 --> 00:54:10,739
Original boxes that are empty...

844
00:54:11,181 --> 00:54:13,843
...that I just ain't got the heart
to throw away.

845
00:54:14,618 --> 00:54:16,677
Just don't film my butt
as I'm going up here.

846
00:54:16,886 --> 00:54:20,754
- Oh, I won't, I won't.
- Just watch your step up here, Rob.

847
00:54:20,957 --> 00:54:25,985
Okay, we're in the bowels of the building,
up in the rafters.

848
00:54:26,196 --> 00:54:29,688
There was too much nice space up here
that we didn't wanna waste.

849
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:36,202
So we built little shelves
so we could put all our IIe's, II Pluses.

850
00:54:36,973 --> 00:54:39,066
And it looks like critters
have been up here...

851
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:43,736
...because some have
fallen down on the insulation.

852
00:54:45,515 --> 00:54:50,885
Apple II monitors, GS monitors,
and every single one works.

853
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:53,950
They were tested
before we put them up here.

854
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:57,654
Back here is a storage shed.

855
00:54:57,861 --> 00:55:02,855
It was meant to hold the things
that were in my basement.

856
00:55:03,066 --> 00:55:08,402
And luckily we built a little bit bigger
than what I intended.

857
00:55:09,272 --> 00:55:11,502
Bell + Howells.

858
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:13,933
These things are going on eBay...

859
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:17,272
I've seen them as high as,
6-, 700 bucks.

860
00:55:18,081 --> 00:55:23,246
It's not ever been a money issue,
collecting or disposing of the Apples.

861
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:28,480
It's probably a sickness that I have.

862
00:55:29,459 --> 00:55:34,362
I have the 128 Mac in hiding.

863
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:37,362
A lot of the SEs, SE/30s.

864
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:39,865
Classics.

865
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:41,799
Only a couple Color Classics.

866
00:55:43,106 --> 00:55:49,875
Six-thousand square feet building
and this is only maybe...

867
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:52,878
...less than half of what I have.

868
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:56,247
There are probably
other Mac people out there...

869
00:55:56,453 --> 00:55:59,513
...same boat as I am,
that just won't throw this stuff away.

870
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:05,454
So I see all these
complaints about <i>Cult of Mac.</i>

871
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:08,854
"What are...? It's not a cult.
This a rational choice."

872
00:56:09,065 --> 00:56:12,466
And these are all these new Windows
people that have just come onboard.

873
00:56:12,669 --> 00:56:16,503
You know, and are sort of defensive
about it a little still.

874
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:19,869
Because their other Windows
friends who haven't crossed over yet.

875
00:56:20,076 --> 00:56:21,805
There's that Macintosh cult following.

876
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:26,080
You don't get a following for nothing,
you know? You get a...

877
00:56:26,282 --> 00:56:29,308
If it's a good product
and it makes people excited...

878
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:31,248
You can have lots of good products.

879
00:56:31,454 --> 00:56:33,888
They are lots of good products.
I got a skillet and it's good.

880
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:36,058
But I'm not crazy about the skillet.

881
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:39,590
Well, it's always been
kind of interesting.

882
00:56:39,796 --> 00:56:43,095
There's definitely a fanatical
sort of zealotry of Mac people.

883
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:49,569
You know?
It's not a religion. It's a computer.

884
00:56:49,973 --> 00:56:53,374
I got a lawn mower too,
but I don't sit around talking about it.

885
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:54,634
Yeah, I mean...

886
00:56:54,844 --> 00:56:57,074
So I cut my grass, whatever, you know?

887
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,145
I type a Word document.

888
00:56:59,349 --> 00:57:02,807
It's a screwdriver or it's a blender,
you know, like whatever.

889
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:06,011
You know, I'm not really in love
with my Mac.

890
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:09,589
I like a good movie
more than I do a good Mac, you know.

891
00:57:09,793 --> 00:57:12,523
I like good beverages
more than my computer.

892
00:57:36,653 --> 00:57:38,746
I watch the rumor sites like a hawk.

893
00:57:40,156 --> 00:57:44,559
And I was a little more lucky this time
because my Blue and White G3...

894
00:57:44,761 --> 00:57:48,663
...we got it and then the G4 came out
two weeks later. It's like, "What?"

895
00:57:48,865 --> 00:57:51,493
Look how they're suing bloggers now,
you know...

896
00:57:51,701 --> 00:57:55,159
...for revealing some details
about a very insignificant product.

897
00:57:56,606 --> 00:58:00,633
Although, it's a problem that's plagued
the company, this kind of rumor control.

898
00:58:02,212 --> 00:58:07,673
I get between 2500
and 3000 unique visitors a day.

899
00:58:07,884 --> 00:58:11,411
And which is, you know,
for the fact that I'm just putting up...

900
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:15,389
...goofy little jokes
about a computer company...

901
00:58:15,592 --> 00:58:17,287
...I think that's pretty good.

902
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:20,395
I was a pretty avid reader
of rumor sites for a long time.

903
00:58:20,597 --> 00:58:24,226
And, you know, usually, I mean, pretty
much through the late part of the '90s.

904
00:58:24,434 --> 00:58:29,371
And constantly checking on what
Apple's gonna do next, that kind of thing.

905
00:58:29,572 --> 00:58:31,437
And then it sort of hit me that...

906
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:34,542
I think around the time
that one of them predicted...

907
00:58:34,744 --> 00:58:38,111
...that there was gonna be
a crank-powered iBook...

908
00:58:38,314 --> 00:58:42,216
...that these guys didn't necessarily know
what they were talking about.

909
00:58:42,418 --> 00:58:45,182
I think they also just got worse
when Steve Jobs came back...

910
00:58:45,388 --> 00:58:48,983
...because he cracked down on the leaks
that were going out to these sites.

911
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:52,059
And so they were probably actually better
during the mid-90s...

912
00:58:52,262 --> 00:58:53,889
...they were probably more accurate.

913
00:58:54,097 --> 00:58:56,930
I've actually gotten, you know...

914
00:58:57,133 --> 00:58:59,158
Been fortunate enough
to have some contact...

915
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:01,200
...with some of the Apple executives...

916
00:59:01,404 --> 00:59:05,431
...who apparently read the site
on a fairly regular basis...

917
00:59:05,642 --> 00:59:10,545
...and e-mail me when they find
something particularly amusing.

918
00:59:11,114 --> 00:59:12,843
There's one person
who I can mention...

919
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:15,381
...since he's not there anymore,
was Avie Tevanian...

920
00:59:16,786 --> 00:59:19,721
...who was the chief technologist
at Apple.

921
00:59:19,923 --> 00:59:26,556
And I had written... I had written a story
about him going into puberty again.

922
00:59:26,763 --> 00:59:31,097
And just how he was
sulking around the office...

923
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:33,963
...and, you know,
kind of shuffling around.

924
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:36,035
And he wouldn't do any work,
and, you know...

925
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,901
And Steve was just having a terrible time
with him...

926
00:59:39,108 --> 00:59:40,507
...and didn't know what to do.

927
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:43,338
And so, you know,
I usually end up writing...

928
00:59:43,546 --> 00:59:45,673
Publishing the stories at night.
And then I go...

929
00:59:45,882 --> 00:59:47,349
You know, pretty much go right to bed.

930
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:50,018
And so I woke up the next morning
and there in my Inbox...

931
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:53,882
...was this e-mail
from Avie Tevanian and I thought:

932
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:59,122
But he was a very good sport about it.
He was amused.

933
00:59:59,329 --> 01:00:02,821
And I managed to avoid any litigation.

934
01:00:03,032 --> 01:00:04,192
Well, I mean it really...

935
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,301
You know, I didn't start out
with any goal other than...

936
01:00:07,503 --> 01:00:09,733
I just found myself
writing these things anyway...

937
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:12,237
...and I wanted a place to publish them.

938
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:16,572
So there was no grand plan in mind.

939
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:19,373
I never thought that I was gonna make
any money doing it.

940
01:00:19,582 --> 01:00:21,072
And I do manage to actually make...

941
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:23,275
...at least a little bit of money
doing it.

942
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:25,947
Keeps me off the streets.

943
01:00:32,328 --> 01:00:35,559
The idea of a start-up sound
was from the Apple II.

944
01:00:35,765 --> 01:00:39,565
The Apple II once it reset,
made a little beep...

945
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:41,259
...with the square wave speaker.

946
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:44,736
So we thought that was a great idea.
Let's the computer know it's...

947
01:00:44,941 --> 01:00:48,843
Let's the world know it made it,
like an infant's first cry.

948
01:00:49,045 --> 01:00:52,173
The very first one we did
for the earliest Mac prototypes...

949
01:00:52,382 --> 01:00:55,840
We had a square-wave sound generator
built into the early Mac prototypes.

950
01:00:56,052 --> 01:00:57,110
We later got rid of that.

951
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:01,689
So I made a thing
that incremented the frequency with...

952
01:01:01,891 --> 01:01:04,883
You know, I tweaked the delay
so it made a whooping sound.

953
01:01:05,094 --> 01:01:08,188
The first original boot sound
was more like something like:

954
01:01:09,132 --> 01:01:15,093
Or whatever. And it was a little comical,
but it wasn't very elegant.

955
01:01:15,304 --> 01:01:18,967
And so I was experimenting
with different things for the boot sound...

956
01:01:19,242 --> 01:01:22,268
...but a guy named Charlie Kellner
had just joined the Mac Team...

957
01:01:22,478 --> 01:01:24,173
...who's also a brilliant musician...

958
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:28,111
...and he had actually designed one
of the first PC-based synthesizers...

959
01:01:28,317 --> 01:01:31,377
...called the alphaSyntauri
for the Apple II.

960
01:01:31,587 --> 01:01:33,680
He was an accomplished musician...

961
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:36,120
...and he kind of looked
what I was doing...

962
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:37,951
...messing around
with different boot sounds.

963
01:01:38,161 --> 01:01:41,153
I guess for the time I was doing it,
everyone could just hear it.

964
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:43,389
You know, trying this, trying that.

965
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:46,534
And he said... Oh, he had an algorithm
he always wanted to use.

966
01:01:46,736 --> 01:01:49,534
That was...
It's not conceptually musical.

967
01:01:49,739 --> 01:01:52,367
It's more conceptual
at the algorithm level...

968
01:01:52,575 --> 01:01:55,544
...which was just filling sound buffer
with a square wave.

969
01:01:55,745 --> 01:02:00,409
And then just making passes through
averaging every adjacent sample...

970
01:02:00,616 --> 01:02:03,346
...till they got to be all the same.

971
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:06,249
And that made
a chiming, bell-like sound.

972
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:11,455
It was in the Mac, you know,
starting in 1984...

973
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:13,458
...and it lasted up until the Mac II...

974
01:02:13,663 --> 01:02:18,100
...where once again, they put in even
more sophisticated sound hardware...

975
01:02:18,301 --> 01:02:20,326
...and they came up
with a different sound...

976
01:02:20,536 --> 01:02:21,969
...that I wasn't involved with.

977
01:02:23,206 --> 01:02:26,232
Well, the start-up sound, let me think...
Well, the main inspiration was...

978
01:02:26,442 --> 01:02:28,637
...how horrible
the one on the Mac II was.

979
01:02:28,845 --> 01:02:32,246
So a tritone is the most dissonant sound
you could imagine.

980
01:02:32,448 --> 01:02:34,814
And stack four of them together.

981
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:40,283
And that was the sound that you heard
when you turned on the Mac.

982
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:43,357
Which was horrible. And so...

983
01:02:44,494 --> 01:02:48,021
...I set out trying to change that
because it didn't make any sense.

984
01:02:48,231 --> 01:02:51,632
Especially when you usually hear
the start-up sound after it crashed.

985
01:02:51,834 --> 01:02:54,359
And so I'm like,
"Great, reward for a crash."

986
01:02:55,004 --> 01:03:01,000
So the sound that I wanted to do
turned out to be, politically, a challenge.

987
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:04,008
No one wanted to change it.
They thought of it as the brand.

988
01:03:04,347 --> 01:03:05,541
There was this new machine...

989
01:03:05,748 --> 01:03:07,841
...that we were building
at the time called the Quadra.

990
01:03:08,584 --> 01:03:11,951
And the Quadra
was going to have better speakers.

991
01:03:12,155 --> 01:03:16,114
And then I'm like, "Great, horrible sound
on better speakers."

992
01:03:16,325 --> 01:03:22,286
And so I started working on new sounds
that would be the sound of...

993
01:03:22,698 --> 01:03:23,824
I kind of thought of it as:

994
01:03:24,033 --> 01:03:26,297
"What's the palette cleanser
for a crash?"

995
01:03:26,602 --> 01:03:30,003
Plus, it was this new,
bigger, badder machine...

996
01:03:30,206 --> 01:03:33,664
...and I wanted it to sound like
a bigger, badder machine.

997
01:03:34,177 --> 01:03:36,338
I remember when <i>Byte</i> magazine
did the review.

998
01:03:36,546 --> 01:03:38,912
The very opening paragraph
of the review was:

999
01:03:39,115 --> 01:03:42,016
"I knew it was gonna be a good
computer by the way it sounded."

1000
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:43,378
So I was like, "I did it."

1001
01:03:43,586 --> 01:03:48,353
That was the actual goal, was I wanted
it to sound like a good computer.

1002
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:52,119
And then unfortunately, what happened
was no one wanted to change the sound.

1003
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:54,023
We ended up just doing it.

1004
01:03:55,932 --> 01:03:57,229
And after that...

1005
01:03:57,433 --> 01:04:00,231
...everybody changed the start-up
sound with every new ROM...

1006
01:04:00,436 --> 01:04:02,961
...which was
exactly the opposite problem.

1007
01:04:03,306 --> 01:04:04,568
You can't establish your brand...

1008
01:04:04,774 --> 01:04:07,004
...if you keep changing your logo
with every release.

1009
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:10,976
And so, you know,
these sonic logos or earcons...

1010
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:14,547
...where, you know, that should be
a recognizable sound.

1011
01:04:15,151 --> 01:04:19,986
Right about the same time
Steve Jobs came back, I heard...

1012
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:25,491
The story I heard was he had said,
"Let's go back to that good sound."

1013
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:27,720
And that was the one
that I had done...

1014
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:29,056
...and so it's still been there.

1015
01:04:29,265 --> 01:04:32,132
It's the same one. It's the only one
that's ever been there since.

1016
01:04:32,435 --> 01:04:35,336
So, I mean, it's kind of cool to hear it
every time, I mean...

1017
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:38,336
I never really think about it,
millions of people crashing...

1018
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:40,475
...and hearing me
play the C-major chord.

1019
01:04:40,676 --> 01:04:43,304
No, it was a widespread
C-major chord...

1020
01:04:43,512 --> 01:04:47,881
...with a high E, I think,
in the upper voice...

1021
01:04:48,084 --> 01:04:52,043
...which, to me, just sounds more bright
and sort of unresolved, but happy.

1022
01:04:52,255 --> 01:04:53,381
It's a happy chord.

1023
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:56,351
It's way better than a tritone.

1024
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:05,590
One psychologist said...

1025
01:05:05,801 --> 01:05:09,396
...that, you know, people form
a social relationship with their machine.

1026
01:05:09,605 --> 01:05:12,005
It becomes like a friend,
it becomes personalized.

1027
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:13,266
It seems a little silly...

1028
01:05:13,476 --> 01:05:16,673
...but you kind of build up
a relationship with your computer.

1029
01:05:16,879 --> 01:05:21,213
And it can either be a good relationship
or it can be a dysfunctional relationship.

1030
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:23,442
You can customize
any computer system...

1031
01:05:23,653 --> 01:05:26,952
...but these are very easy
to develop a relationship with.

1032
01:05:27,156 --> 01:05:29,420
That's different from customizing.

1033
01:05:29,725 --> 01:05:32,694
They're the closest devices
that I know of...

1034
01:05:32,895 --> 01:05:34,954
...that are really symbiotic.

1035
01:05:35,164 --> 01:05:37,325
And I'll admit it,
you know, when they...

1036
01:05:37,533 --> 01:05:41,697
When they do make it
so that you can kind of jack in neurally...

1037
01:05:41,904 --> 01:05:43,531
...I'll do that.

1038
01:05:43,973 --> 01:05:48,034
Yeah, I think maybe somebody
needs to sit down with those people.

1039
01:05:48,244 --> 01:05:50,405
Maybe it's Dr. Phil.

1040
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:53,945
Your computer doesn't love you.

1041
01:05:57,586 --> 01:06:01,078
This relationship is not working.

1042
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:05,327
Don't be an enabler.

1043
01:06:05,528 --> 01:06:10,465
Their soul is somehow reflected
in that machine.

1044
01:06:10,666 --> 01:06:15,103
It's an object of communication,
but also of creativity.

1045
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:18,831
You know, the most essential things
that they are...

1046
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:23,535
...the things that express themselves,
are expressed through the computer.

1047
01:06:23,746 --> 01:06:26,544
And so they invest, you know,
so much in that...

1048
01:06:26,749 --> 01:06:29,274
...that it's a cybernetic relationship.

1049
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:55,372
When Steve came back...

1050
01:06:55,578 --> 01:06:58,945
...he was like, "Hey, you know,
we should get into this music thing."

1051
01:06:59,148 --> 01:07:01,514
I mean, he saw it.

1052
01:07:01,884 --> 01:07:06,514
But to me it was, like, five years late,
like that was obvious five years earlier.

1053
01:07:06,722 --> 01:07:09,054
I think Apple
could be as big as Sony right now...

1054
01:07:09,258 --> 01:07:11,522
...if it had been five years earlier.

1055
01:07:11,727 --> 01:07:14,560
A phone? Finally? Whatever.

1056
01:07:14,897 --> 01:07:16,387
A couple of years ago when they...

1057
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:20,057
Apple said it was gonna come through
with some breakthrough device...

1058
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:22,669
...there was a lot of speculation
about what this might be.

1059
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:26,740
People figured it was a music player,
but exactly what, no one knew.

1060
01:07:26,942 --> 01:07:29,968
And people were saying on the forums
they were gonna buy it anyway.

1061
01:07:30,179 --> 01:07:34,639
It didn't matter. They were gonna get it
because it was gonna be fucking great.

1062
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:37,444
The iPod people
have had the iPods in their pocket...

1063
01:07:37,653 --> 01:07:39,314
...mainly because they love music.

1064
01:07:39,522 --> 01:07:43,481
And that's... And as do
the Apple employees who created it.

1065
01:07:43,692 --> 01:07:45,887
You know, people complain about it,
but it's...

1066
01:07:46,095 --> 01:07:50,759
The fact that they were able
to make the iPod is actually why...

1067
01:07:50,966 --> 01:07:53,901
You know, one of the reasons
why Macs are still around.

1068
01:07:54,103 --> 01:07:56,901
It's only really clear
when you compare it to other products.

1069
01:07:57,106 --> 01:08:01,099
They're a pain in the ass to use.
I mean, they are impossible.

1070
01:08:01,544 --> 01:08:04,911
There are more iPods in my house
than there are people.

1071
01:08:05,114 --> 01:08:07,344
By probably 2-to-1.

1072
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:09,541
But I never use an iPod.

1073
01:08:10,019 --> 01:08:11,714
I have...

1074
01:08:12,455 --> 01:08:13,820
...five.

1075
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:17,857
I think I have five or we have five.
The family has five, I think.

1076
01:08:18,828 --> 01:08:23,356
You know, that's like this whole
video thing on your iPod. Who cares?

1077
01:08:23,566 --> 01:08:26,160
I thought we used to complain
about postage-stamp movies.

1078
01:08:26,368 --> 01:08:29,997
I mean, that was the complaint we had
16 years ago and it's back to the future.

1079
01:08:30,206 --> 01:08:32,834
I got this iPod. What am l...?

1080
01:08:33,309 --> 01:08:35,106
A movie on an iPod.
I don't even get it.

1081
01:08:35,311 --> 01:08:38,508
Like, you think, "How long
can I hold this up in front of my face...

1082
01:08:38,714 --> 01:08:40,238
...before my arm gets tired?"

1083
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:43,384
I mean, I can't even get through
one TV sitcom.

1084
01:08:43,986 --> 01:08:45,681
Progress.

1085
01:08:50,025 --> 01:08:52,960
A big part of Apple's marketing budget...

1086
01:08:53,162 --> 01:08:56,393
...was, like, sticking the machines
in movies and TV shows.

1087
01:08:56,599 --> 01:08:58,794
You know, so it culminated with...

1088
01:08:59,001 --> 01:09:01,231
What was it called? <i>Independence Day.</i>

1089
01:09:01,437 --> 01:09:06,602
When the PowerBook
taps into the alien computer...

1090
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:09,039
...and blows up the alien ship.

1091
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:13,042
They paid, you know, tens of millions
of dollars, I believe, to do that.

1092
01:09:13,249 --> 01:09:14,876
This is when product placement...

1093
01:09:15,084 --> 01:09:17,484
...was starting to become big business
in Hollywood.

1094
01:09:17,686 --> 01:09:20,849
But since then, you know,
you see them all over the place.

1095
01:09:21,056 --> 01:09:23,286
I mean, they are all over TV.

1096
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:25,585
You know,
part of it is product placement...

1097
01:09:25,794 --> 01:09:28,820
...part of it is because Macs
are popular in Hollywood, you know.

1098
01:09:29,031 --> 01:09:30,896
Obviously, they're used for video editing.

1099
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:36,896
I've edited somewhere
between 40 and 50 movies.

1100
01:09:37,106 --> 01:09:40,598
Television, theatrical movies.

1101
01:09:40,809 --> 01:09:42,572
No documentaries.

1102
01:09:42,778 --> 01:09:44,405
Richard Halsey
Los Angeles, California

1103
01:09:44,613 --> 01:09:48,777
We'll, I'll start with my calling card:
<i>Rocky, Down and Out in Beverly Hills...</i>

1104
01:09:48,984 --> 01:09:55,412
<i>... Beaches, American Gigolo,</i>
<i>Sister Act...</i>

1105
01:09:55,624 --> 01:10:00,789
<i>... The Net, Payday</i>,
one of my favorite movies.

1106
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:04,363
I was a very successful film editor.

1107
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:07,567
Editing mechanically
with German machines...

1108
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:12,730
...KEMs, Steinbecks,
Moviolas, whatever.

1109
01:10:12,942 --> 01:10:14,170
Everything you can imagine.

1110
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:17,106
Every piece of mechanical equipment
you can imagine, I used.

1111
01:10:17,546 --> 01:10:20,845
Well, I wanted to move forward
into computers...

1112
01:10:21,116 --> 01:10:24,950
...but believe it or not,
they were reluctant to.

1113
01:10:25,154 --> 01:10:29,921
They still thought it was cheaper
to edit the old mechanical way.

1114
01:10:30,125 --> 01:10:32,559
I had experimented around
with the Lucas system...

1115
01:10:32,761 --> 01:10:36,026
...the Laserdisc system.
That thing was ridiculous.

1116
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:38,359
The Montage, that was ridiculous.

1117
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:43,338
And the Lightworks,
that was sort of starting to happen.

1118
01:10:43,839 --> 01:10:48,674
And basically, it wasn't till 1995
which was late in the game.

1119
01:10:48,877 --> 01:10:53,177
And mostly at that point,
early '90s it was, you know, the Avid.

1120
01:10:53,882 --> 01:10:56,407
I went and I had to do a picture,
a Columbia Picture...

1121
01:10:56,619 --> 01:10:58,746
...a Sandra Bullock picture
called <i>The Net.</i>

1122
01:10:58,954 --> 01:11:01,354
Had a very short
post-production schedule.

1123
01:11:01,890 --> 01:11:04,450
I had no experience,
had no idea what I was doing.

1124
01:11:04,693 --> 01:11:10,689
Within three hours,
I had the basic principles down.

1125
01:11:10,899 --> 01:11:13,026
So it was a good system.

1126
01:11:13,235 --> 01:11:20,164
I continued editing on that system
for at least seven, eight years.

1127
01:11:20,509 --> 01:11:23,342
And then I jumped into Final Cut.

1128
01:11:24,647 --> 01:11:30,210
And I've been editing in Final Cut,
you know, ever since.

1129
01:11:30,653 --> 01:11:34,521
I mean, it's an amazing system.

1130
01:11:34,723 --> 01:11:37,749
Take a simple film
like <i>Edward Scissorhands.</i>

1131
01:11:39,028 --> 01:11:40,723
We were editing mechanically.

1132
01:11:40,929 --> 01:11:42,624
I was editing with my wife.

1133
01:11:42,831 --> 01:11:47,097
Well, we went to location
with four KEMs.

1134
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:49,061
I was editing, she was editing.

1135
01:11:49,271 --> 01:11:51,967
And then we had
a husband and wife team.

1136
01:11:52,174 --> 01:11:53,732
They were our assistants.

1137
01:11:53,942 --> 01:11:58,106
So there was four of us
and that was really economical.

1138
01:11:58,314 --> 01:12:01,909
And we had four editing machines, and
we were able to keep up with camera.

1139
01:12:02,117 --> 01:12:06,076
We were able to get a Christmas release
and do the movie quite quickly.

1140
01:12:06,922 --> 01:12:10,881
With this system, I'm pretty much
a one-man band and my assistant.

1141
01:12:11,093 --> 01:12:13,425
I can do the job...

1142
01:12:13,796 --> 01:12:18,165
...of six or seven editors
in the old system.

1143
01:12:18,567 --> 01:12:22,526
Well, you can see.
I mean, look at the environment now.

1144
01:12:22,738 --> 01:12:26,799
Instead of editing in 1200 square feet,
I can edit in 200 square feet.

1145
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:40,679
Apple is Steve Jobs, for sure.

1146
01:12:40,889 --> 01:12:43,187
I mean, he is the one
who defines the company.

1147
01:12:43,392 --> 01:12:46,020
He founded it, but I mean,
look at its recent history.

1148
01:12:46,228 --> 01:12:48,389
He has his personality
stamped all over it.

1149
01:12:48,597 --> 01:12:50,121
I used to say about Steve...

1150
01:12:50,332 --> 01:12:54,530
...that he was the best person possible
to work for and also the worst...

1151
01:12:55,537 --> 01:12:59,769
...because he's a man of extremes.
Steve's extremely passionate.

1152
01:13:00,142 --> 01:13:02,303
He's incredibly sharp.

1153
01:13:02,511 --> 01:13:05,480
He's, more than anything else,
incredibly quick.

1154
01:13:05,681 --> 01:13:09,583
He's got the quickest mind
of anyone I've ever talked to.

1155
01:13:09,785 --> 01:13:13,448
Yeah, I mean, I idolize Steve Jobs.
He's absolutely, you know, one of my...

1156
01:13:13,655 --> 01:13:16,852
He's my favorite celebrity,
but I don't pretend that I'd understand...

1157
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:19,892
...what would come out of his mouth
if I asked him a question.

1158
01:13:20,262 --> 01:13:23,197
I cannot explain
how Steve comes up with these things...

1159
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:25,526
...because he has a different
operating system.

1160
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:28,134
So mere mortals
cannot understand him.

1161
01:13:28,337 --> 01:13:30,430
That's why
when people try to understand him...

1162
01:13:30,639 --> 01:13:34,268
...and his quirks and all of that, they get
very frustrated because you can't.

1163
01:13:34,476 --> 01:13:40,472
It would be like telling a fish how
to understand how a bird feels flying.

1164
01:13:40,682 --> 01:13:43,810
It cannot be. The fish is stuck
in the water, the bird is soaring.

1165
01:13:44,019 --> 01:13:47,284
It's a different operating system.
That's what it is.

1166
01:13:48,056 --> 01:13:50,547
I think Apple is his place in the world.

1167
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:52,954
This is where it all began.

1168
01:13:53,162 --> 01:13:57,292
And obviously, it's...
You know, it's a piece of himself.

1169
01:13:57,499 --> 01:13:59,330
It's a company that...

1170
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:07,232
...seems like it needs somebody who's
not just your ordinary CEO to run it.

1171
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:12,574
They've tried a number of ordinary CEOs
in the '90s and it just didn't work.

1172
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:17,647
Because if you look at the time era
that Jobs was not there...

1173
01:14:17,853 --> 01:14:20,845
...Apple fell into a category
where their Macs...

1174
01:14:21,056 --> 01:14:23,752
...were just becoming
like everyday computers.

1175
01:14:23,959 --> 01:14:25,893
And there was nothing special
about them.

1176
01:14:26,094 --> 01:14:29,586
But of course Steve Jobs
has an incredibly strong aesthetic...

1177
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:31,288
...in case you can't tell.

1178
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:35,800
I don't think you could change the DNA
of Apple if you tried.

1179
01:14:36,004 --> 01:14:39,440
So Apple's DNA
is in building cool stuff...

1180
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:41,905
...it's an engineering company.

1181
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:44,169
They can say
they're marketing and all that.

1182
01:14:44,379 --> 01:14:46,609
But a marketing-driven company
is a company...

1183
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:48,908
...that theoretically listens
to the market...

1184
01:14:49,117 --> 01:14:52,018
...and delivers
what the market says it wants.

1185
01:14:52,454 --> 01:14:56,788
You could say many things about Apple,
but that ain't one of them. Okay?

1186
01:14:56,992 --> 01:14:58,892
They don't listen to anybody.

1187
01:14:59,094 --> 01:15:02,188
Apple's idea of market research is,
you know...

1188
01:15:02,397 --> 01:15:05,298
...Steve's right hemisphere
is connected to his left hemisphere.

1189
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:06,729
That's the focus group.

1190
01:15:06,935 --> 01:15:10,098
Immediately when Jobs came back,
the first thing he did was the iMac.

1191
01:15:10,305 --> 01:15:13,240
He set the personality, he set
the tone of the computer. He's like:

1192
01:15:13,442 --> 01:15:17,173
"Here. We're gonna break boundaries,
we're gonna take it to the next level...

1193
01:15:17,379 --> 01:15:18,539
...the next edge."

1194
01:15:18,747 --> 01:15:22,706
You could make the case
that Apple III wasn't his...

1195
01:15:22,918 --> 01:15:26,979
...and Newton wasn't his,
and Lisa wasn't his.

1196
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:30,022
So the only time it flubbed
or stubbed its toe...

1197
01:15:30,225 --> 01:15:32,591
...was when Steve wasn't behind it.

1198
01:15:32,794 --> 01:15:39,222
I don't see Apple being able to continue
at the pace that it's going right now.

1199
01:15:39,434 --> 01:15:43,564
I mean, I don't expect it to suddenly,
you know, fumble and fall...

1200
01:15:43,772 --> 01:15:45,967
...but it's not gonna be what it is now.

1201
01:15:47,442 --> 01:15:50,843
No, the problem is going to be
post-Steve.

1202
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:54,607
If you bring in some dickhead
who thinks that he's mini-Steve...

1203
01:15:54,816 --> 01:15:56,545
...and he, too, is a visionary...

1204
01:15:56,752 --> 01:16:00,848
...and, he, too understands
what people need, but cannot express.

1205
01:16:01,056 --> 01:16:02,956
So this dickhead is gonna say:

1206
01:16:03,158 --> 01:16:06,059
"All right, so this is what I've decreed
people will want.

1207
01:16:06,261 --> 01:16:09,162
And I'm the new Steve Jobs."

1208
01:16:12,501 --> 01:16:14,128
The company will implode.

1209
01:16:14,336 --> 01:16:20,434
That depends on whether or not
the philosophy employed by Steve...

1210
01:16:20,642 --> 01:16:26,080
...in focusing on product and having
a passionate view of the product...

1211
01:16:26,281 --> 01:16:30,183
...and it's relationship
to the rest of the operating enterprise.

1212
01:16:30,886 --> 01:16:34,413
If they get somebody like that in there
then it will continue...

1213
01:16:34,623 --> 01:16:40,027
...as an ever-growing, ever-expanding,
ever-creative enterprise.

1214
01:16:41,096 --> 01:16:43,394
Well, that's interesting.

1215
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:46,033
You know, that's an interesting thought.
I don't know.

1216
01:16:46,234 --> 01:16:50,864
Whether it just...
Apple's just gonna stagnate, you know?

1217
01:16:52,107 --> 01:16:55,634
Well, the story,
and I don't know if it's true...

1218
01:16:55,844 --> 01:17:00,804
...but when you went into the HP lobby,
there was H's portrait and P's portrait.

1219
01:17:01,016 --> 01:17:05,919
And when Carly came in,
she put her portrait, okay?

1220
01:17:09,224 --> 01:17:10,816
You know what I'm coming to, right?

1221
01:17:11,026 --> 01:17:14,257
I mean,
you hire some dickhead who does that...

1222
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:16,192
...it's game over, baby.

1223
01:17:16,398 --> 01:17:20,596
We'll all be listening to Zunes
and using Windows machines.

1224
01:17:20,802 --> 01:17:24,294
If they get a bottom-line man in there,
it may succeed...

1225
01:17:24,506 --> 01:17:29,603
...but it will never have the aura
and the passion that it has today.

1226
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:33,110
You can trace the greatness
of Apple pretty closely...

1227
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:35,249
...back to the greatness of Steve.

1228
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:37,941
Some of the flaws of Apple as well.

1229
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:43,352
I can't build a case that it's going
to be easy to find another Steve Jobs.

1230
01:17:43,558 --> 01:17:48,791
It may not be that
you want another Steve Jobs...

1231
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:51,830
...because there can be no other
Steve Jobs.

1232
01:17:57,873 --> 01:18:01,639
The Macintosh spirit was not something
we created with the Macintosh...

1233
01:18:01,843 --> 01:18:06,007
...although we sort of contributed to it.
But it was there before the Macintosh...

1234
01:18:06,214 --> 01:18:08,682
...because it's really the spirit
of the Apple II.

1235
01:18:08,884 --> 01:18:11,079
And so much of the spirit
of the Apple II...

1236
01:18:11,286 --> 01:18:17,282
...is the spirit of Steve Wozniak's
personality as well as Steve Jobs'.

1237
01:18:17,492 --> 01:18:20,620
You know,
the core of Apple is to change the world.

1238
01:18:20,829 --> 01:18:23,354
And that has not changed.
I don't think it can.

1239
01:18:23,565 --> 01:18:26,090
I don't think it could change
if you tried to change it.

1240
01:18:26,301 --> 01:18:28,963
In a broader sense,
some of that spirit of the Apple II...

1241
01:18:29,171 --> 01:18:32,265
...was the spirit
of the personal computer revolution.

1242
01:18:32,474 --> 01:18:34,965
And really what that is,
more than anything else...

1243
01:18:35,177 --> 01:18:40,080
...is the celebration
of unbounded possibility.

1244
01:18:40,282 --> 01:18:42,512
The key thing...
Those first microcomputers...

1245
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:46,654
...even pre-Apple II, but even
the Apple II's couldn't really do much.

1246
01:18:46,855 --> 01:18:48,846
Yet they were incredibly exciting...

1247
01:18:49,057 --> 01:18:52,788
...because you knew they were the seed
that would change the world.

1248
01:18:52,994 --> 01:18:57,192
And if you look at Steve and Woz,
what they did is they created Apple I...

1249
01:18:57,532 --> 01:18:59,966
...which was to change the world.

1250
01:19:00,168 --> 01:19:02,796
Apple II changed the world.

1251
01:19:03,705 --> 01:19:06,173
Macintosh changed the world.

1252
01:19:06,374 --> 01:19:07,568
iPod changed the world...

1253
01:19:07,776 --> 01:19:09,835
...and maybe this phone
will change the world.

1254
01:19:10,045 --> 01:19:13,674
So, you know, that's five things.
You can't call that luck.

1255
01:19:13,982 --> 01:19:18,214
We filled the machine with our love
and passion for what we were doing.

1256
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:20,911
And it radiates out
on the other side of the screen...

1257
01:19:21,123 --> 01:19:22,818
...and it affects the user.

1258
01:19:33,401 --> 01:19:36,666
A lot of people were shown
Apple computers in schools.

1259
01:19:36,872 --> 01:19:39,170
Apple's very, very prominent
in schools...

1260
01:19:39,374 --> 01:19:42,866
...and therefore people that have
gone through the school systems...

1261
01:19:43,078 --> 01:19:45,012
...into college
have just stuck with Apple.

1262
01:19:45,213 --> 01:19:48,808
The ones that see it as
a truly superior product, which it can be.

1263
01:19:49,017 --> 01:19:53,044
Well, we're like all other user groups.
We got together because, you know...

1264
01:19:53,255 --> 01:19:55,883
...stuff was really expensive,
you couldn't afford much.

1265
01:19:56,091 --> 01:19:57,353
And quite frankly...

1266
01:19:57,559 --> 01:20:01,154
...almost every user group in the world
started out as a pirate group...

1267
01:20:01,363 --> 01:20:03,661
...and became legitimate.

1268
01:20:04,566 --> 01:20:08,969
The commercial is great.
The commercial is fantastic.

1269
01:20:09,171 --> 01:20:14,040
I then edited <i>Pirates of Silicon Valley</i>
many years later...

1270
01:20:14,242 --> 01:20:18,508
...and the movie started off
with that same commercial.

1271
01:20:22,417 --> 01:20:23,714
Well?

1272
01:20:23,919 --> 01:20:25,682
- Oh, my...
- Oh, God, not...

1273
01:20:25,887 --> 01:20:28,014
Now, I don't have... Oh, shit.

1274
01:20:30,091 --> 01:20:32,321
Another thing Burrell and I
would do every day...

1275
01:20:32,527 --> 01:20:35,826
...in the earlier days of the project
when we were at Texaco Towers...

1276
01:20:36,031 --> 01:20:38,795
...is before we were
doing something healthy...

1277
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,959
...we would go across the street
to Cicero's Pizzeria and play "Defender."

1278
01:20:43,638 --> 01:20:45,162
For one thing I'm living proof...

1279
01:20:45,373 --> 01:20:50,470
...if you do one thing right in your career,
you can coast for a long time.

1280
01:20:52,047 --> 01:20:53,776
A long time.

1281
01:20:53,982 --> 01:21:00,046
Do you think Steve Jobs is gonna
be willing to sit down and talk to us?

1282
01:21:00,255 --> 01:21:03,281
Sit down and talk to you? No.

1283
01:21:04,426 --> 01:21:06,018
Oh, I didn't wanna tell you this...

1284
01:21:06,228 --> 01:21:08,458
...but Steve was in here
about four months ago...

1285
01:21:08,663 --> 01:21:11,461
...and spent part of a day,
about three hours here.

1286
01:21:11,833 --> 01:21:14,666
But I'll make a prediction,
and my prediction is...

1287
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:17,464
...you will not talk to Steve Jobs
for this documentary.

1288
01:21:17,672 --> 01:21:20,140
No, that's good.
That's... I'm glad that he...

1289
01:21:20,742 --> 01:21:24,542
Probably, probably would say no.

1290
01:21:24,846 --> 01:21:28,179
That depends on the mood he's in
when you try to talk to him.

1291
01:21:28,383 --> 01:21:30,977
If you hit him on a good day,
it's, "Come on in.

1292
01:21:31,186 --> 01:21:32,778
Come down, we'll go to dinner."

1293
01:21:33,788 --> 01:21:37,053
I mean, half the time he's not willing
to sit down and talk to CNNfn.

1294
01:21:37,259 --> 01:21:38,692
You know what I mean? He...

1295
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:42,295
I think he bolted out of one of those
interviews a couple of years ago.

1296
01:21:42,497 --> 01:21:46,228
You get him on a bad day, it's,
"Sorry, I haven't got time for this."

1297
01:21:46,434 --> 01:21:50,268
Presuming you don't go skidding
down the stairs on your hindquarters.

1298
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:54,637
The only way you could hook him
would be to show him some of the film.

1299
01:21:55,510 --> 01:22:00,004
I called him up and asked him
to come visit when he had a chance.

1300
01:22:01,616 --> 01:22:03,675
- You're fibbing, of course.
- I am fibbing.

1301
01:22:03,885 --> 01:22:04,986
Okay. That was good.

1302
01:22:04,986 --> 01:22:05,452
Okay. That was good.

1303
01:22:06,154 --> 01:22:08,554
Had enough?

1304
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:14,024
Steve will not talk
to the <i>New York Times</i> usually.

1305
01:22:14,229 --> 01:22:16,595
It might be better
even if you didn't have him.

1306
01:22:16,798 --> 01:22:19,289
- It might be better...
- That was a discussion, yes.

1307
01:22:19,501 --> 01:22:23,597
- if you had a, like a cloaked figure
behind the background.

1308
01:22:23,805 --> 01:22:26,865
You know what I mean?
And this was the mysterious Jobs.

1309
01:22:27,075 --> 01:22:28,508
You know?

1310
01:22:30,979 --> 01:22:34,005
I shouldn't tell you this,
but he lives walking distance from here.

1311
01:22:34,215 --> 01:22:38,743
- You could go stake out the house.
- No, he'd probably call on us.

1312
01:22:38,954 --> 01:22:41,821
- Yeah, he probably would.
- Yeah, that's the thing.
