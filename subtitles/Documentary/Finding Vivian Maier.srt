1
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,911
Paradoxical.

2
00:00:42,557 --> 00:00:44,149
Bold.

3
00:00:44,893 --> 00:00:45,893
Yeah.

4
00:00:47,996 --> 00:00:49,827
Mysterious.

5
00:00:49,864 --> 00:00:51,161
Eccentric.

6
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,496
Eccentric.

7
00:00:53,201 --> 00:00:54,533
Private.

8
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,334
She was
a very, very private woman.

9
00:00:57,373 --> 00:01:00,774
I never had any idea
she took pictures.

10
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,211
She would take photographs...
many, many photographs.

11
00:01:04,246 --> 00:01:06,714
She would never have
let this happen.

12
00:01:06,749 --> 00:01:09,081
Is there anything that you wish...

13
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:11,382
you would have done differently
then?

14
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,183
Sure, I wish I would have
found those negatives

15
00:01:13,222 --> 00:01:14,314
instead of you.

16
00:01:34,996 --> 00:01:40,888
Synced and corrected by R3V0LV3R.

17
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:47,582
It was winter 2007.

18
00:01:51,761 --> 00:01:55,254
The auction house is across
the street from my home.

19
00:01:55,298 --> 00:01:59,632
I found this box
that was loaded with negatives.

20
00:02:00,904 --> 00:02:02,531
75, there we go, $80.

21
00:02:02,572 --> 00:02:04,039
I was writing a history book,

22
00:02:04,074 --> 00:02:07,009
and I needed
a lot of historic photos.

23
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:09,308
And so I would, like, you know,
take the negatives

24
00:02:09,346 --> 00:02:10,472
and I'd look up into the light,

25
00:02:10,514 --> 00:02:12,709
and I'd look for images
of Chicago.

26
00:02:12,749 --> 00:02:14,512
150, 160.

27
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:17,850
There were several boxes
that went with the set.

28
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:20,083
I just went for the biggest one.

29
00:02:20,123 --> 00:02:22,023
39 is your buyer.

30
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:23,549
39 is your buyer.

31
00:02:23,593 --> 00:02:25,891
I won it for...
I think it was $380.

32
00:02:25,929 --> 00:02:30,093
The auction house
told me the photographer,

33
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:31,623
her name was Vivian Maier.

34
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:38,130
Google searched her.
Nothing at all.

35
00:02:38,175 --> 00:02:40,370
I mean, absolutely nothing.

36
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,277
So I just kind of gave up
for a while.

37
00:02:43,313 --> 00:02:46,282
I looked at some of the stuff
that night, and it was cool,

38
00:02:46,316 --> 00:02:49,843
but nothing worked for the book,
so I just put it in the closet.

39
00:02:49,886 --> 00:02:51,148
Just had to figure out,

40
00:02:51,188 --> 00:02:53,315
"What am I gonna do
with this stuff?"

41
00:02:53,356 --> 00:02:57,657
That's what sparked me
to start scanning it.

42
00:03:01,632 --> 00:03:05,068
I have a reflex
where we'll be driving somewhere

43
00:03:05,103 --> 00:03:06,502
and I'll just, like,
spot something

44
00:03:06,537 --> 00:03:10,166
from down the road
that I know what it is

45
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,176
and I know that it's valuable.

46
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:15,111
I grew up doing the flea markets
with my brother.

47
00:03:15,146 --> 00:03:18,445
My father did it.
His father did it.

48
00:03:18,483 --> 00:03:21,919
I would do storage auctions
with my brother,

49
00:03:21,953 --> 00:03:24,854
and he'd win some,
and we'd clean them out.

50
00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:28,791
We threw out tons of negatives,

51
00:03:28,826 --> 00:03:30,589
'cause there's no value
in negatives

52
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:33,995
to most resale people.

53
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:36,591
In these negatives
that I discovered,

54
00:03:36,634 --> 00:03:38,067
what I saw at first,

55
00:03:38,102 --> 00:03:40,263
I didn't know
if it was really good.

56
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:42,465
I knew that I thought
it was good.

57
00:03:42,507 --> 00:03:45,305
I contacted a couple galleries.

58
00:03:45,343 --> 00:03:48,073
I didn't know where to go.

59
00:03:48,112 --> 00:03:52,310
I made a photo blog,
and I put about 200 images up.

60
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:33,357
I put a link on Flickr.

61
00:04:38,397 --> 00:04:42,663
That post, it just went insane.

62
00:04:56,648 --> 00:04:59,116
So I went on this mission

63
00:04:59,151 --> 00:05:01,643
to piece together
the rest of her work.

64
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:05,050
And then I found
the other people

65
00:05:05,091 --> 00:05:07,753
who bought boxes
and I bought their boxes.

66
00:05:07,794 --> 00:05:09,421
And then I had
all these negatives...

67
00:05:09,462 --> 00:05:11,930
like, insane amounts
of negatives.

68
00:05:13,566 --> 00:05:18,128
You always want to know,
who is behind the work?

69
00:05:19,205 --> 00:05:22,732
I just knew
her name was Vivian Maier.

70
00:05:22,775 --> 00:05:24,868
Was she a journalist?

71
00:05:24,911 --> 00:05:27,675
Professional photographer?

72
00:05:27,714 --> 00:05:30,012
Let me just Google her name
again

73
00:05:30,049 --> 00:05:32,040
to see if there's anything up.

74
00:05:33,753 --> 00:05:36,017
And I found an obituary

75
00:05:36,055 --> 00:05:39,582
that was placed just a few days
before that search.

76
00:05:41,027 --> 00:05:45,464
I found an address in her stuff.

77
00:05:45,498 --> 00:05:48,023
And after some, like,
white page searches,

78
00:05:48,067 --> 00:05:52,163
I called and I said,

79
00:05:52,205 --> 00:05:56,699
"I have the work, the negatives
of Vivian Maier."

80
00:05:56,743 --> 00:05:58,608
And he's like,
"Oh, that was my nanny."

81
00:06:01,014 --> 00:06:02,482
That was his nanny?

82
00:06:04,685 --> 00:06:07,119
Why is a nanny...

83
00:06:08,489 --> 00:06:10,252
Taking all these photos?

84
00:06:12,993 --> 00:06:18,295
What they started to tell me
about her was-was strange.

85
00:06:21,068 --> 00:06:23,195
They said,
"She was kind of a loner.

86
00:06:23,237 --> 00:06:25,364
"She didn't have any family
that we knew of.

87
00:06:25,406 --> 00:06:28,864
"She never had any love life
or children that we knew of.

88
00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:30,501
But she was like our mother."

89
00:06:33,013 --> 00:06:36,471
So it just caught my curiosity.

90
00:06:36,517 --> 00:06:39,748
So what I said was,
"Do you have any of her stuff?"

91
00:06:39,787 --> 00:06:43,279
And they said, "Well, I've been
keeping up the bills"

92
00:06:43,324 --> 00:06:44,450
"on her storage locker.

93
00:06:44,491 --> 00:06:45,685
"We want to throw
all this stuff out.

94
00:06:45,726 --> 00:06:47,353
She was a packrat."

95
00:06:47,394 --> 00:06:49,154
I said, "No, no, no,
don't throw anything."

96
00:06:49,163 --> 00:06:50,630
He's like,
"You don't understand.

97
00:06:50,664 --> 00:06:53,292
"She was a packrat.

98
00:06:53,334 --> 00:06:54,995
"We're gonna get a dumpster.

99
00:06:55,035 --> 00:06:56,764
"You're welcome to come
and help us.

100
00:06:56,804 --> 00:06:58,164
"If you see anything
that you like

101
00:06:58,172 --> 00:07:00,265
that we're gonna throw out,
you can have."

102
00:07:02,276 --> 00:07:06,213
I just wanted to go find out
who she was, just a quick thing.

103
00:07:13,922 --> 00:07:17,221
I found this leather chest.

104
00:07:17,258 --> 00:07:18,691
It was, like, taped shut

105
00:07:18,727 --> 00:07:21,855
with just, like, box tape
or something.

106
00:07:21,896 --> 00:07:26,128
And so we cut it
and we opened it,

107
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:33,005
and it was filled to the top
with rolls of undeveloped film.

108
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:36,568
I took one canister
and I shook it,

109
00:07:36,611 --> 00:07:38,511
and it rattled.

110
00:07:38,546 --> 00:07:42,141
So I opened it,
and there was teeth inside.

111
00:07:47,188 --> 00:07:53,491
She had stuff wedged and hidden
in everything that she had,

112
00:07:53,528 --> 00:07:56,725
almost like it's like
a secret little hiding spot

113
00:07:56,765 --> 00:07:58,596
for all of her little things.

114
00:07:58,633 --> 00:08:03,900
A coupon, a note, a flyer,
bus passes to train cards,

115
00:08:03,938 --> 00:08:07,272
her hats, shoes,

116
00:08:07,309 --> 00:08:10,301
her coats, her blouses.

117
00:08:10,346 --> 00:08:13,315
I have uncashed
income tax checks

118
00:08:13,349 --> 00:08:14,373
from the government

119
00:08:14,417 --> 00:08:16,282
amounting to
thousands of dollars.

120
00:08:29,999 --> 00:08:32,194
I have around 100,000 negatives.

121
00:08:32,234 --> 00:08:35,829
I have 700 rolls
of undeveloped color film,

122
00:08:35,871 --> 00:08:39,602
2,000 undeveloped rolls
of black-and-white film.

123
00:08:39,642 --> 00:08:43,134
I realized everything needs
to be organized and scanned

124
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:44,737
and archived.

125
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:48,580
But it was more
than I can handle myself.

126
00:08:48,617 --> 00:08:52,451
So I thought, "Let's see what
the museums will do to help me."

127
00:08:52,488 --> 00:08:53,848
"Maybe I could get this
into MoMA.

128
00:08:53,856 --> 00:08:56,051
Maybe I could get this
into Tate Modern."

129
00:08:56,092 --> 00:09:02,053
I sent them letters,
and here is the reply.

130
00:09:03,566 --> 00:09:05,864
"Dear Mr. Maloof,
on behalf of the curators,

131
00:09:05,901 --> 00:09:07,164
"I would like to thank you

132
00:09:07,204 --> 00:09:09,404
"for thinking of the Department
of Photography at MoMA.

133
00:09:09,439 --> 00:09:11,532
"Unfortunately,
the museum cannot accommodate

134
00:09:11,575 --> 00:09:13,338
these photographs
at this time."

135
00:09:15,011 --> 00:09:19,971
At that point,
I just figured I'm on my own.

136
00:09:22,586 --> 00:09:24,952
I'm gonna try to do
an exhibition.

137
00:09:24,988 --> 00:09:27,582
I'm gonna do a book.

138
00:09:27,624 --> 00:09:29,990
It's an insane amount of work.

139
00:09:30,026 --> 00:09:34,395
I'm kind of compulsive
with stuff.

140
00:09:34,431 --> 00:09:37,958
I just wanted people to see
this incredible work.

141
00:09:39,569 --> 00:09:41,127
And I applied for a show

142
00:09:41,171 --> 00:09:42,866
at the Cultural Center
in Chicago.

143
00:09:52,549 --> 00:09:55,541
They said this was
the biggest turnout

144
00:09:55,585 --> 00:09:59,214
for any artist
they had ever had.

145
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:03,050
And then the story
just took off.

146
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,193
The history
of street photography

147
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:11,201
is currently being re-written.

148
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:12,896
- Vivian Maier.
- Vivian Maier.

149
00:10:12,937 --> 00:10:13,995
Vivian Maier?

150
00:10:14,038 --> 00:10:15,733
Saved from obscurity.

151
00:10:15,773 --> 00:10:18,003
In death,
she is getting the fame

152
00:10:18,042 --> 00:10:19,771
that she never had in life.

153
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,971
John Maloof is still working
his way

154
00:10:22,013 --> 00:10:24,243
through all Maier's negatives.

155
00:10:24,282 --> 00:10:28,378
My mission is to put Vivian
in the history books.

156
00:10:32,223 --> 00:10:34,384
My first impression
when I saw the work

157
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:38,725
was the kind of delight
when a surprise comes your way

158
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:42,859
and you feel that somebody
hitherto undiscovered

159
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,868
suddenly makes their work
available

160
00:10:44,902 --> 00:10:46,460
and it looks good.

161
00:10:46,504 --> 00:10:49,871
It looks like
there's an authentic eye

162
00:10:49,907 --> 00:10:53,001
and a real savvy
about human nature

163
00:10:53,044 --> 00:10:56,207
and photography and the street.

164
00:10:56,247 --> 00:10:58,943
And that kind of thing
doesn't happen that often.

165
00:10:58,983 --> 00:11:00,644
I see thousands of pictures.

166
00:11:00,685 --> 00:11:03,552
Day after day, people send me
their websites to look at,

167
00:11:03,588 --> 00:11:04,788
and when I flick through them,

168
00:11:04,822 --> 00:11:07,620
I feel most of them
are undistinguished.

169
00:11:07,658 --> 00:11:11,959
But Vivian's work
instantly had those qualities

170
00:11:11,997 --> 00:11:16,627
of human understanding
and warmth and playfulness

171
00:11:16,668 --> 00:11:19,933
that I thought,
"This is a genuine shooter."

172
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,001
She had a great eye.

173
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:27,407
She-great sense of framing.

174
00:11:27,446 --> 00:11:29,141
What is she looking at here?

175
00:11:29,181 --> 00:11:30,512
I can't-
this is the first one-

176
00:11:30,549 --> 00:11:32,109
it's a muddy
construction worker's butt.

177
00:11:32,117 --> 00:11:35,518
Oh, my God.

178
00:11:35,554 --> 00:11:38,079
She had a sense of humor

179
00:11:38,123 --> 00:11:41,456
and a sense of tragedy.

180
00:11:43,962 --> 00:11:46,055
Beautiful.

181
00:11:46,098 --> 00:11:50,057
Her photos of children
are beautiful.

182
00:11:50,102 --> 00:11:54,038
Beautiful sense of light,
environment...

183
00:11:54,072 --> 00:11:56,370
I mean, she had it all.

184
00:11:56,408 --> 00:11:59,002
Was she very prolific?
Did she shoot a lot?

185
00:11:59,044 --> 00:12:03,003
In total, there's
about 150,000 negatives.

186
00:12:03,048 --> 00:12:05,141
She shot a lot.

187
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,447
She never showed her work
to anybody?

188
00:12:09,488 --> 00:12:11,046
That's what I'm trying
to figure out.

189
00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:12,853
So far, no.

190
00:12:12,892 --> 00:12:14,951
I think people
would have loved her work.

191
00:12:15,928 --> 00:12:18,192
I mean, I could even say
Robert Frank

192
00:12:18,231 --> 00:12:21,325
with a square format.

193
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:23,267
Lisette Model?

194
00:12:24,637 --> 00:12:26,798
Helen Levitt, definitely.

195
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:31,774
Diane Arbus,
some of the street portraits.

196
00:12:33,112 --> 00:12:34,545
Had she made herself known,

197
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:38,175
she would have become
a famous photographer.

198
00:12:38,217 --> 00:12:39,946
Something was wrong.
Something-

199
00:12:39,986 --> 00:12:44,821
There's-there's a piece
of the puzzle missing.

200
00:12:44,857 --> 00:12:47,257
That's beautiful.

201
00:12:49,128 --> 00:12:50,891
I really want to know,

202
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:53,057
why did Vivian make
these images?

203
00:12:53,099 --> 00:12:56,694
What drove her
to such compulsion,

204
00:12:56,736 --> 00:13:00,331
to an obsessive degree,
to take so many pictures?

205
00:13:00,373 --> 00:13:02,841
Why were they never shown?

206
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:07,844
I started to unbox
all of her stuff.

207
00:13:08,214 --> 00:13:11,741
I'm finding leads, you know,
receipts that she had.

208
00:13:11,784 --> 00:13:17,052
But her-her receipts
are from the '70s and '80s,

209
00:13:17,091 --> 00:13:18,888
and in the '70s and '80s
in Chicago,

210
00:13:18,926 --> 00:13:21,326
there was no area code.

211
00:13:21,362 --> 00:13:23,762
And I started calling
these phone numbers,

212
00:13:23,797 --> 00:13:26,357
attaching every
various area code...

213
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:31,428
773, 312, 708, 847, 630, 815.

214
00:13:31,472 --> 00:13:33,838
Was she ever a nanny
for the Usiskin family?

215
00:13:33,874 --> 00:13:35,341
Yes.

216
00:13:35,376 --> 00:13:37,105
Oh, my gosh!

217
00:13:37,144 --> 00:13:39,874
Yeah, she lived right next door.

218
00:13:50,758 --> 00:13:54,455
I know Vivian Maier because
she was my childhood nanny...

219
00:13:55,829 --> 00:13:58,024
for about four years,
something like that.

220
00:14:00,901 --> 00:14:03,961
Her job was as a housekeeper
and a nanny.

221
00:14:05,606 --> 00:14:08,473
Vivian was my nanny.

222
00:14:08,509 --> 00:14:10,602
Vivian came into our lives

223
00:14:10,644 --> 00:14:14,239
when we needed a caretaker
for my mother.

224
00:14:14,281 --> 00:14:17,911
I was just staring at her,
and I had thought,

225
00:14:17,952 --> 00:14:22,013
"Where did my sister find
this lady to babysit her kids?"

226
00:14:30,198 --> 00:14:33,429
She was obsessed with
just saving bits of memories,

227
00:14:33,468 --> 00:14:35,834
of moments in time.

228
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,462
The stuff that she collected

229
00:14:37,505 --> 00:14:40,565
all helped me understand her
a little better.

230
00:14:40,608 --> 00:14:43,907
I have dozens of audio tapes
that Vivian made.

231
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,419
I have around 150

232
00:15:01,463 --> 00:15:04,990
8-millimeter
and 16-millimeter movies.

233
00:15:15,743 --> 00:15:18,838
I found pictures
of Phil Donahue,

234
00:15:18,881 --> 00:15:22,647
like, in his home,
petting a dog and at dinner.

235
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,711
I was a single parent
in Winnetka, lllinois,

236
00:15:26,755 --> 00:15:28,586
with four sons.

237
00:15:28,624 --> 00:15:30,785
Along comes Vivian.

238
00:15:30,826 --> 00:15:32,487
I met her in a diner

239
00:15:32,528 --> 00:15:36,089
to interview her
for this housekeeper job.

240
00:15:36,131 --> 00:15:38,361
She took my picture.

241
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,528
I was a guy running
back and forth over my shoes.

242
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:44,869
I had to do a program
every day, sometimes two.

243
00:15:44,907 --> 00:15:46,374
I didn't want any trouble.

244
00:15:46,408 --> 00:15:50,037
I just-you know, I just wanted
clean socks.

245
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,173
She was with us
less than a year.

246
00:15:53,215 --> 00:15:58,949
I have a memory of her taking
a picture inside a garbage can.

247
00:16:01,624 --> 00:16:05,924
I thought, "Well, you know,
they laughed at Picasso."

248
00:16:05,961 --> 00:16:07,553
I didn't know.

249
00:16:07,596 --> 00:16:08,756
I mean, I didn't give it
much thought.

250
00:16:08,797 --> 00:16:11,288
I didn't think she was crazy.

251
00:16:14,937 --> 00:16:17,599
Vivian took self-portraits.

252
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,973
In my mind, I don't know

253
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,477
what image I had of this person,

254
00:16:21,511 --> 00:16:25,777
but it was definitely not
the image that I uncovered.

255
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:43,832
She came across as unusual.

256
00:16:43,867 --> 00:16:47,667
She wore big, big coats,
felt hats.

257
00:16:47,704 --> 00:16:53,108
The kind of thing that might
have been popular in 1925.

258
00:16:55,211 --> 00:16:57,941
She was always
kind of hiding her figure...

259
00:16:57,981 --> 00:17:02,042
you know, wearing these heavy
clothes and these boots.

260
00:17:02,085 --> 00:17:03,746
They used to call her
"Army Boots."

261
00:17:05,989 --> 00:17:07,388
She was very tall.

262
00:17:07,424 --> 00:17:08,982
Seven feet?

263
00:17:09,025 --> 00:17:10,151
No!

264
00:17:10,193 --> 00:17:11,490
- Seven feet.
- She was tall.

265
00:17:11,528 --> 00:17:13,052
Oh, she must have been
about 5'9".

266
00:17:13,096 --> 00:17:14,393
Six foot?

267
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,192
She liked wearing men's shirts.

268
00:17:18,234 --> 00:17:19,428
She wore men's shirts.

269
00:17:19,469 --> 00:17:21,301
I think she said
the tailoring was better.

270
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,006
She'd have kind of a-
just a straight blunt cut.

271
00:17:25,042 --> 00:17:28,375
She had hair
that stuck straight up.

272
00:17:28,412 --> 00:17:30,175
Now, looking back,

273
00:17:30,214 --> 00:17:31,511
I would say she kind of dressed

274
00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:35,451
like you would expect to find
women factory workers

275
00:17:35,486 --> 00:17:37,954
in the Soviet Union
in the '50s or something.

276
00:17:39,323 --> 00:17:40,915
That's how she walked.

277
00:17:43,628 --> 00:17:46,358
You have to swing
your arms up like this,

278
00:17:46,397 --> 00:17:50,094
and you have to do
a sort of a Nazi march.

279
00:17:50,134 --> 00:17:54,002
You'd see her
on her little motorized bicycle.

280
00:17:54,038 --> 00:17:55,478
I mean, I remember
sometimes thinking

281
00:17:55,506 --> 00:17:58,339
she kind of looked like
the Wicked Witch of the West.

282
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:02,005
Always had her camera
around her neck.

283
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,908
Always the camera
around her neck.

284
00:18:07,551 --> 00:18:10,850
She had, like,
this great camera with-

285
00:18:10,888 --> 00:18:13,482
I remember it was
a square Rolleiflex.

286
00:18:13,524 --> 00:18:15,116
You flip open the thing,

287
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:18,185
and you look through
the viewfinder directly down.

288
00:18:18,229 --> 00:18:20,789
I'd lusted
after a twin-lens Rolly,

289
00:18:20,831 --> 00:18:22,459
and here she had one.

290
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,196
And I looked at that camera,

291
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:27,694
and it looked like
it was rather old.

292
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:35,603
You see, the Rolleiflex
is a great disguise camera...

293
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:38,342
Because it wasn't up here,

294
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:41,284
where she had to alert somebody
on the street

295
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:42,513
that she was photographing.

296
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:45,182
She could be sort of secretive
down here.

297
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:49,519
The camera was shooting
from below,

298
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:54,521
and it gave her pictures
a kind of towering magnitude.

299
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:57,328
There's a picture of a guy.

300
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:59,303
He's just an ordinary
street guy,

301
00:18:59,337 --> 00:19:03,398
but he has a power and dignity.

302
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:07,776
And he's standing there,
and he's looking at her.

303
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,542
If you look at his eye line,

304
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:11,242
he's looking
right into her face,

305
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:14,150
and she probably looked down
and focused

306
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:16,586
and then looked right up at him.

307
00:19:16,621 --> 00:19:20,887
And he looked at her,
and she fired the shutter.

308
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:25,330
Street photographers
tend to be gregarious

309
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:27,594
in the sense that they can go
out on the street

310
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:31,125
and they're comfortable
being among people,

311
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,697
but they're also a funny mixture
of solitaries

312
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:37,471
at the same time
as being gregarious.

313
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,070
You observe and you embrace
and you take in,

314
00:19:40,113 --> 00:19:44,049
but you stay back
and you try to stay invisible.

315
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:47,715
She didn't like to talk
about herself.

316
00:19:47,754 --> 00:19:51,019
Some people I meet,
and they're very open.

317
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:54,493
She was not an open person;
she was a closed person.

318
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:57,758
She lived on the third floor,
in our attic,

319
00:19:57,797 --> 00:19:59,890
and one of the first things
she asked me for

320
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:02,230
was please to put in a lock

321
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:06,432
so that she could lock her area
securely.

322
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:09,908
It was a real serious lock.

323
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:13,241
She was mysterious.

324
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:17,682
She said don't ever open
this door to her room.

325
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:21,819
I think she made friends with me

326
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:24,482
because she sized me up
and thought I was strong enough

327
00:20:24,524 --> 00:20:26,152
to lift a bunch of boxes
for her.

328
00:20:26,193 --> 00:20:29,492
I broke the springs of my car.

329
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:34,024
I think that gives you an idea
of how much weight I lifted.

330
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:37,400
She mentioned that she brought
her life with her,

331
00:20:37,437 --> 00:20:40,065
which meant a number of boxes.

332
00:20:40,107 --> 00:20:42,974
We said, "Sure, no problem,"
'cause we had a garage.

333
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:45,171
There was a porch
off of the room, you know,

334
00:20:45,212 --> 00:20:47,680
sort of those sleeping porches.

335
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:50,911
And it was piled high
with boxes.

336
00:20:50,951 --> 00:20:55,012
We put them in our garage,
which, fortunately,

337
00:20:55,055 --> 00:20:59,253
was a 2 1/2 car garage
for two cars,

338
00:20:59,293 --> 00:21:00,590
and so we had this-

339
00:21:00,627 --> 00:21:02,151
It became a two-car garage.

340
00:21:02,196 --> 00:21:04,323
It became-became
a tight two-car garage.

341
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:06,093
Now, of course, we'll never know

342
00:21:06,133 --> 00:21:08,363
how much the boxes were
her photographs

343
00:21:08,402 --> 00:21:09,528
and how much the boxes were-

344
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:10,832
Oh, John knows.

345
00:21:10,871 --> 00:21:14,363
Well, but she had so many boxes.

346
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:18,705
I'd like to know why
you would hoard

347
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:20,440
all of this great art.

348
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,846
Why would-
why wouldn't you share it?

349
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,244
What's the point of taking it
if no one sees it?

350
00:21:27,221 --> 00:21:28,814
It's so sad, really.

351
00:21:28,857 --> 00:21:30,722
It's really sad.

352
00:21:30,758 --> 00:21:33,158
If you could have just shown her
all the pictures

353
00:21:33,194 --> 00:21:34,593
and held her down
in a chair somewhere

354
00:21:34,629 --> 00:21:35,629
so she couldn't-

355
00:21:35,663 --> 00:21:38,530
put a tape on her mouth
so she couldn't tell you no.

356
00:21:38,566 --> 00:21:40,625
Obviously, the woman
was so creative,

357
00:21:40,668 --> 00:21:45,332
and it must have been
galling to just, you know,

358
00:21:45,373 --> 00:21:46,567
be a maid.

359
00:21:47,675 --> 00:21:50,974
Wash the floors,
making some lunch and dinner,

360
00:21:51,012 --> 00:21:54,243
taking care of kids as a nanny.

361
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,949
Some of the early photos
I have are from 1951.

362
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:10,297
One of them said on the back,
"The Walkers, Southampton."

363
00:22:11,366 --> 00:22:14,096
I was surprised to see
the photographs

364
00:22:14,135 --> 00:22:16,865
of my grandparents' house.

365
00:22:16,905 --> 00:22:19,635
We always called it Tides' End.

366
00:22:26,681 --> 00:22:30,914
It's amazing to see it
so dilapidated.

367
00:22:32,888 --> 00:22:35,186
This was flowers.

368
00:22:35,224 --> 00:22:38,990
We'd have lunches out here
and tea, and...

369
00:22:39,028 --> 00:22:41,121
it was wonderful.

370
00:22:41,163 --> 00:22:43,825
Vivian probably spent
the summer.

371
00:22:43,866 --> 00:22:46,960
She was probably a nanny
out of New York,

372
00:22:47,002 --> 00:22:50,733
tagging along with the family
and the children.

373
00:22:50,773 --> 00:22:53,799
In those days, your father
worked in New York

374
00:22:53,842 --> 00:22:58,336
and came out by train on Friday
and went back on Sunday.

375
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:01,645
I don't think that's changed
very much.

376
00:23:01,684 --> 00:23:03,914
If you go
to the beach club today

377
00:23:03,953 --> 00:23:06,080
and go down on the sand,

378
00:23:06,121 --> 00:23:08,385
you'll see the nannies there.

379
00:23:08,424 --> 00:23:10,915
Some of these women
have been lucky enough

380
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,020
to make their way up here
to the United States.

381
00:23:14,063 --> 00:23:18,329
The girl who helps me, this is
her fifth or sixth year here.

382
00:23:18,367 --> 00:23:19,891
What's her name?

383
00:23:19,935 --> 00:23:21,368
Olivia.

384
00:23:23,138 --> 00:23:24,696
Delightful, delightful person.

385
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,071
I love her dearly.

386
00:23:28,077 --> 00:23:31,070
She speaks very little English,
and I speak very little Spanish.

387
00:23:31,114 --> 00:23:32,604
We get along beautifully.

388
00:23:36,434 --> 00:23:38,997
STUPID WHITE MEN - MICHAEL MOORE

389
00:23:42,459 --> 00:23:45,519
It's been written about
that she had few friends.

390
00:23:45,562 --> 00:23:50,397
And I consider myself
one of those friends.

391
00:23:50,433 --> 00:23:52,367
I liked her a lot.

392
00:23:52,402 --> 00:23:55,394
She was a terrific person.

393
00:23:55,438 --> 00:23:59,738
In 1962,
I lived in Highland Park.

394
00:23:59,776 --> 00:24:00,976
I had a lot of small children.

395
00:24:00,977 --> 00:24:02,604
I was home a lot.

396
00:24:02,645 --> 00:24:04,875
One of my children was friendly

397
00:24:04,914 --> 00:24:07,644
with one of the boys
she took care of.

398
00:24:07,684 --> 00:24:10,915
The children, they were always
at each other's houses,

399
00:24:10,954 --> 00:24:14,014
and she would come by,
and we had good conversations

400
00:24:14,057 --> 00:24:17,356
with kids swirling around us
all the time.

401
00:24:17,394 --> 00:24:20,363
I had a very freewheeling,
open household.

402
00:24:22,432 --> 00:24:24,923
There weren't a lot of rules...

403
00:24:24,968 --> 00:24:27,129
you know, "Don't get killed
in the street."

404
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:30,196
She loved the children,
and the children loved her.

405
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,369
She was wonderful
to the children...

406
00:24:35,913 --> 00:24:37,471
I think probably loved them

407
00:24:37,515 --> 00:24:41,451
as much as she probably loved
anybody.

408
00:24:41,485 --> 00:24:43,453
Knock, knock!

409
00:24:43,487 --> 00:24:45,250
Apple.

410
00:24:45,289 --> 00:24:47,223
Apple knock, knock.

411
00:24:47,258 --> 00:24:49,385
Who's there?

412
00:24:49,427 --> 00:24:50,427
Apple.

413
00:24:50,428 --> 00:24:51,827
Knock, knock.

414
00:24:51,862 --> 00:24:52,862
Who's there?

415
00:24:52,897 --> 00:24:54,057
Knock, knock.

416
00:24:54,098 --> 00:24:55,588
Knock, knock who?

417
00:25:00,137 --> 00:25:01,764
Oh, God.

418
00:25:02,373 --> 00:25:03,806
Well, gentlemen...

419
00:25:03,841 --> 00:25:05,775
I think she was quite lively

420
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:08,904
and wonderful person
in her younger years.

421
00:25:08,946 --> 00:25:11,107
I mean, she must have been
a delight.

422
00:25:11,148 --> 00:25:14,242
I can see
how they worshipped her,

423
00:25:14,285 --> 00:25:16,776
because she was doing
the adventures

424
00:25:16,821 --> 00:25:20,780
that normally a parent
would probably not do.

425
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:25,285
Life was more adventurous
with her around.

426
00:25:25,963 --> 00:25:27,453
She was very opinionated

427
00:25:27,498 --> 00:25:29,398
about how children
should spend their time

428
00:25:29,433 --> 00:25:30,991
and mainly
how they should spend it

429
00:25:31,035 --> 00:25:32,696
was out and about with her.

430
00:25:32,736 --> 00:25:34,466
She would load up the stroller

431
00:25:34,506 --> 00:25:37,532
with the baby and her bag
and both kids,

432
00:25:37,576 --> 00:25:39,339
and off they would go
on outings.

433
00:25:39,377 --> 00:25:41,208
And they had their routine.

434
00:25:41,246 --> 00:25:43,806
There was a Marshall Field's
in downtown Evanston,

435
00:25:43,849 --> 00:25:46,477
and it had a candy counter
on the first floor.

436
00:25:46,518 --> 00:25:48,110
Well, that was always
the first stop

437
00:25:48,153 --> 00:25:50,587
because there were always
free samples.

438
00:25:50,622 --> 00:25:53,352
She would avail herself
very heartily

439
00:25:53,391 --> 00:25:54,983
of the free samples,

440
00:25:55,026 --> 00:25:57,358
meaning, like, dump!

441
00:25:57,395 --> 00:26:00,330
You know, she'd dump
the whole tray of Frango mints

442
00:26:00,365 --> 00:26:02,697
into her purse and walk away.

443
00:26:03,869 --> 00:26:05,097
We stopped going there
all of a sudden,

444
00:26:05,137 --> 00:26:07,332
but I believe that she was
kicked out

445
00:26:07,372 --> 00:26:10,170
of Marshall Field's permanently.

446
00:26:10,208 --> 00:26:13,735
A really clear memory is her
setting up to take photos

447
00:26:13,778 --> 00:26:15,837
of all these naked mannequins.

448
00:26:15,881 --> 00:26:17,712
Some of them were headless.

449
00:26:17,749 --> 00:26:20,013
Some of them were toppled over
a little bit.

450
00:26:20,051 --> 00:26:22,281
I mean, it'll be probably
an amazing photograph,

451
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,311
but as a child,
it was taking forever,

452
00:26:24,356 --> 00:26:26,036
standing there
on the corner of the street,

453
00:26:26,057 --> 00:26:28,958
waiting while this weird lady
takes pictures

454
00:26:28,994 --> 00:26:30,757
of these naked, headless
mannequins.

455
00:26:30,795 --> 00:26:32,285
Then they would go out

456
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:34,890
and they would look
in the alleys for junk,

457
00:26:34,933 --> 00:26:36,834
because that was
what she liked to do.

458
00:26:36,869 --> 00:26:39,030
She would come home
with pieces of metal,

459
00:26:39,071 --> 00:26:41,562
old furniture,
and we would look at it.

460
00:26:41,607 --> 00:26:43,541
"Is this art?
Is this not art?

461
00:26:43,576 --> 00:26:45,441
"What is this?
Oh, this could be useful.

462
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:47,946
This could come in handy
sometime."

463
00:26:49,382 --> 00:26:51,179
My brother, Robbie,

464
00:26:51,217 --> 00:26:53,447
he was riding his bike home
from school,

465
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:54,714
and he got hit by a car.

466
00:26:54,754 --> 00:26:57,052
He was sort of laying
in the middle of the street,

467
00:26:57,089 --> 00:26:58,818
and an ambulance was coming,
and he-

468
00:26:58,858 --> 00:27:00,792
and he says-and I don't know
if this is true,

469
00:27:00,826 --> 00:27:03,920
but he always said that Vivian
was taking pictures of him

470
00:27:03,963 --> 00:27:05,430
laying on the ground.

471
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:09,733
It wasn't like,
"Oh, Robbie, you okay?"

472
00:27:09,769 --> 00:27:10,463
or anything.

473
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:12,463
It was more just,
"Oh, this is a good photo op."

474
00:27:18,778 --> 00:27:20,473
My mother drove up

475
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:23,846
and saw my brother
lying in the street.

476
00:27:23,883 --> 00:27:26,818
She said, "Oh, I thought
the dogs got hit."

477
00:27:29,789 --> 00:27:31,518
Vivian was just kind of
above the fray,

478
00:27:31,557 --> 00:27:33,616
and I remember thinking,
you know,

479
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:36,457
"There's Vivian taking pictures
as usual."

480
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,968
She was aware
of what was going on

481
00:27:42,002 --> 00:27:45,563
in politics and society
at the time.

482
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:51,133
She would bring
this cassette recorder,

483
00:27:51,178 --> 00:27:53,408
and she goes to the supermarket.

484
00:27:53,447 --> 00:27:56,780
And she's asking people
in line...

485
00:27:56,817 --> 00:27:58,307
- Hi, Carl.
- Hi.

486
00:27:58,352 --> 00:27:59,683
I got you with my machine.

487
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,187
I was wondering
if you had anything to say

488
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,917
about all this political scene.

489
00:28:03,957 --> 00:28:05,948
- Well...
- About Nixon and so on.

490
00:28:05,993 --> 00:28:07,517
I think that it happened
the way it should

491
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:09,290
for the best of the country.

492
00:28:09,329 --> 00:28:11,092
And maybe it'll be a warning

493
00:28:11,131 --> 00:28:12,291
to future politicians.

494
00:28:12,332 --> 00:28:13,663
That's right.
That's right.

495
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:17,601
But what did you think
of the impeachment?

496
00:28:17,638 --> 00:28:19,037
- Well, come on.
- Am I on tape?

497
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,733
Yes, you are.
Come on.

498
00:28:20,774 --> 00:28:22,332
I don't know.

499
00:28:22,376 --> 00:28:24,173
Well, you should have
an opinion.

500
00:28:24,211 --> 00:28:26,270
Women are supposed to be
opinionated, I hope.

501
00:28:26,313 --> 00:28:28,645
Come on.

502
00:28:28,682 --> 00:28:31,150
There's one movie that she made

503
00:28:31,184 --> 00:28:34,153
that has a note in it.

504
00:28:34,187 --> 00:28:40,286
And it says, "1972 Chicago
murder of mother and baby."

505
00:28:40,328 --> 00:28:42,922
"Market where she found ad
for babysitting job,

506
00:28:42,964 --> 00:28:45,933
which had led
to disappearance and death."

507
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:57,934
Then you see her walking
to the supermarket.

508
00:29:00,615 --> 00:29:04,107
She's walking
in the babysitter's footsteps.

509
00:29:07,689 --> 00:29:10,590
You see her walking
to the neighborhood.

510
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:14,925
I just wonder if that's where
the crime happened.

511
00:29:20,702 --> 00:29:24,160
She goes to the funeral home.

512
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:38,285
She's kind of...

513
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:40,753
a journalist of the era, like-

514
00:29:40,788 --> 00:29:43,952
but usually you do that
to show people, you know,

515
00:29:43,992 --> 00:29:45,516
to show this is what happened.

516
00:29:45,561 --> 00:29:47,051
She just did it.

517
00:29:53,535 --> 00:30:00,031
One day in 1977, I was driving
on Sheridan Road,

518
00:30:00,075 --> 00:30:02,509
and someone flagged me
for hitchhiking.

519
00:30:02,544 --> 00:30:04,808
Plenty of people do that.

520
00:30:04,847 --> 00:30:07,680
Turned out to be Vivian Maier.

521
00:30:07,716 --> 00:30:11,652
When I met Vivian back in 1972,

522
00:30:11,687 --> 00:30:14,121
I was in grad school
at Northwestern.

523
00:30:14,156 --> 00:30:16,317
And I worked
in the language lab,

524
00:30:16,358 --> 00:30:18,053
and it was not at all unusual

525
00:30:18,093 --> 00:30:21,722
for eccentric people to be
coming through the lab.

526
00:30:21,764 --> 00:30:23,595
She was French.

527
00:30:23,632 --> 00:30:26,795
She had lost most of her accent,
I would say.

528
00:30:26,835 --> 00:30:31,238
She affected what at the time
struck me instantly

529
00:30:31,273 --> 00:30:32,968
as a fake French accent.

530
00:30:33,008 --> 00:30:35,374
Some people have said
she had a fake accent,

531
00:30:35,411 --> 00:30:37,504
but this is-this is not true.

532
00:30:37,546 --> 00:30:39,104
My degree is in linguistics.

533
00:30:39,148 --> 00:30:40,911
I have a PhD in linguistics.

534
00:30:43,219 --> 00:30:45,483
And the truth is,
it was a fake accent.

535
00:30:48,024 --> 00:30:50,584
Oh, I happened to see the film

536
00:30:50,627 --> 00:30:52,993
The Four Horsemen
of the Apocalypse,

537
00:30:53,029 --> 00:30:54,758
and I'm probably not pronouncing

538
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:57,358
the word right, and...

539
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:01,063
There's the lilting sound
of it, you know?

540
00:31:01,104 --> 00:31:02,332
"I don't really know

541
00:31:02,372 --> 00:31:03,566
"what you want me to do,

542
00:31:03,606 --> 00:31:05,836
"but you have to do it
and come over later,

543
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:07,467
and then everything
will be okay."

544
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:09,774
Her voice, it seemed like
it went up and down.

545
00:31:09,813 --> 00:31:11,280
You know what I'm saying?

546
00:31:11,314 --> 00:31:12,713
Oooooh.

547
00:31:12,749 --> 00:31:16,276
Her vowels were longer
in duration than French vowels.

548
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:19,288
I mean, you know, this is the-
I did a-

549
00:31:19,322 --> 00:31:23,588
my master's thesis was on
vowel duration in French,

550
00:31:23,626 --> 00:31:25,389
so I had a little bit
of background in it.

551
00:31:26,162 --> 00:31:29,495
I believe it's someone who had
polished their English accent,

552
00:31:29,532 --> 00:31:32,831
having then lost
some of their French accent.

553
00:31:32,869 --> 00:31:36,066
You don't want to see a copy
of my dissertation, so...

554
00:31:37,607 --> 00:31:38,835
Well...

555
00:31:38,875 --> 00:31:40,536
No, you don't, really.

556
00:31:42,979 --> 00:31:45,414
I asked her her name.

557
00:31:45,449 --> 00:31:47,508
She kind of paused.
I remember that.

558
00:31:47,551 --> 00:31:50,486
And she said, "Call me Smith."

559
00:31:50,521 --> 00:31:51,920
I mean, it was very clear

560
00:31:51,956 --> 00:31:54,550
she didn't want to tell me
her name.

561
00:31:54,592 --> 00:31:56,890
I thought, "This is weird."

562
00:32:00,431 --> 00:32:03,525
She had been a customer of ours.

563
00:32:03,567 --> 00:32:06,536
She was a pain in the neck,
to be truthful.

564
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:10,097
We held things for her
for as long as a year.

565
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:13,041
We would say,
"What's your name?"

566
00:32:13,077 --> 00:32:15,807
"I'm not going to tell you."

567
00:32:15,846 --> 00:32:20,112
"Well, we can't keep it
without a name."

568
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:23,483
"All right, Miss V. Smith."

569
00:32:26,957 --> 00:32:29,255
You know, ha ha ha,
Miss V. Smith.

570
00:32:29,293 --> 00:32:33,252
It was patently obvious
that she was not Miss V. Smith.

571
00:32:33,297 --> 00:32:35,663
And we'd say,
"Okay, phone number."

572
00:32:35,699 --> 00:32:37,496
"I don't have a phone."

573
00:32:37,535 --> 00:32:39,335
"Well, how are we gonna
get in touch with you

574
00:32:39,336 --> 00:32:40,667
if we need to?"

575
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,728
"Well, you won't."

576
00:32:45,709 --> 00:32:51,148
Why was she giving us
a fake name?

577
00:32:51,182 --> 00:32:55,949
We didn't think as much about it
as you are.

578
00:33:00,358 --> 00:33:02,519
Now, she spelled her name
differently.

579
00:33:02,561 --> 00:33:06,019
There's B-as in boy-Maier.

580
00:33:06,064 --> 00:33:09,830
Every possible combination
of ways you could spell Maier...

581
00:33:09,868 --> 00:33:14,305
M-e-y-e-r, M-a-i-e-r, M-a-y-e-r.

582
00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:16,603
We always called her Miss Maier.

583
00:33:16,641 --> 00:33:19,337
Miss Maiers.

584
00:33:19,377 --> 00:33:20,969
She said, "Call me Viv."

585
00:33:21,012 --> 00:33:24,379
You would never have called
this woman "Viv."

586
00:33:24,416 --> 00:33:25,542
Vivian.

587
00:33:25,584 --> 00:33:27,108
Nobody called her Viv?

588
00:33:27,152 --> 00:33:29,143
No, Vivian.

589
00:33:29,187 --> 00:33:34,124
Why wouldn't you want
to tell people your real name?

590
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:36,320
I asked her what she did,

591
00:33:36,361 --> 00:33:39,296
and her answer was another thing
I'll never forget.

592
00:33:39,331 --> 00:33:41,128
"I'm sort of a spy."

593
00:33:41,166 --> 00:33:42,531
That's exactly what she said.

594
00:33:42,567 --> 00:33:44,262
I can still see her
and hear her saying it.

595
00:33:44,302 --> 00:33:47,430
It was so odd.

596
00:33:47,472 --> 00:33:49,737
I think the only person
who says that

597
00:33:49,775 --> 00:33:53,233
is somebody who's definitely
not a spy.

598
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,076
Why would you say that?

599
00:34:09,061 --> 00:34:11,859
Maybe she wanted to be
somebody else.

600
00:34:11,897 --> 00:34:14,457
A lot of us do that.

601
00:34:18,738 --> 00:34:23,402
If she did not have this job
as the babysitter,

602
00:34:23,442 --> 00:34:29,244
her lifestyle would have been
very understandable.

603
00:34:29,281 --> 00:34:32,773
The real question is, why did
she do this kind of work?

604
00:34:35,254 --> 00:34:38,883
Her intelligence
and her views on things,

605
00:34:38,924 --> 00:34:40,653
there was something
very precious to her

606
00:34:40,693 --> 00:34:42,285
about keeping them secret.

607
00:34:43,729 --> 00:34:49,862
Vivian may have looked down,
so to speak, on the employers

608
00:34:49,903 --> 00:34:53,703
who were hiring her for this
low-paying kind of work.

609
00:34:56,276 --> 00:34:59,040
She identified with the poor.

610
00:35:05,752 --> 00:35:07,743
I mean, she said she doesn't go
to a doctor.

611
00:35:07,788 --> 00:35:09,346
She doesn't have
any medical insurance.

612
00:35:09,389 --> 00:35:11,619
And I said, "Are you-
are you worried about that?"

613
00:35:11,658 --> 00:35:15,424
And she said,
"The poor are too poor to die."

614
00:35:17,631 --> 00:35:21,431
She told me that when
she first came to New York,

615
00:35:21,468 --> 00:35:25,268
she went to work
in a sewing sweatshop.

616
00:35:25,305 --> 00:35:27,899
She realized one day
that she wanted to do something

617
00:35:27,941 --> 00:35:31,638
where she could be outside
and in the world, out and about,

618
00:35:31,678 --> 00:35:34,613
and see the sun,
so she took up nannying.

619
00:35:36,316 --> 00:35:41,379
She felt that it gave her
a certain amount of freedom.

620
00:35:41,421 --> 00:35:45,016
Somebody else was providing
the shelter for her.

621
00:35:45,058 --> 00:35:48,152
She wasn't having
to work so hard

622
00:35:48,195 --> 00:35:50,060
just to make ends meet.

623
00:35:50,097 --> 00:35:54,296
So she had some free time
for her photographic endeavors.

624
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:04,744
1959.

625
00:36:04,779 --> 00:36:09,978
Vivian told her employer,
"I'm going to travel the world,

626
00:36:10,017 --> 00:36:11,541
and I'll be back
in eight months."

627
00:36:13,488 --> 00:36:17,117
She went to Bangkok, lndia,
Thailand,

628
00:36:17,158 --> 00:36:20,218
Egypt, Yemen,

629
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:22,422
all of South America.

630
00:36:22,463 --> 00:36:25,227
She traveled by herself...

631
00:36:26,901 --> 00:36:29,461
Just her and her camera.

632
00:36:29,504 --> 00:36:33,167
There are thousands of photos
from her world travels.

633
00:37:06,842 --> 00:37:09,174
Do you think Vivian would like

634
00:37:09,211 --> 00:37:11,406
the attention
that she's getting?

635
00:37:11,446 --> 00:37:13,209
I think she was a very-
I don't know.

636
00:37:13,248 --> 00:37:14,374
I don't think so.

637
00:37:14,416 --> 00:37:17,385
I think she was more of
a very private person.

638
00:37:17,419 --> 00:37:19,910
I don't-l think
she might have seen this

639
00:37:19,955 --> 00:37:22,321
as kind of an intrusion,
you know?

640
00:37:25,561 --> 00:37:32,865
I can't help but to feel
a little uncomfortable or guilty

641
00:37:32,901 --> 00:37:39,568
exposing the work of a person
who did not want to be exposed.

642
00:37:41,243 --> 00:37:43,871
She was so secretive.

643
00:37:43,912 --> 00:37:46,210
I think that she would like
her artwork to be honored,

644
00:37:46,248 --> 00:37:48,273
but I don't think she personally
would have liked

645
00:37:48,317 --> 00:37:49,477
being in the limelight.

646
00:37:49,518 --> 00:37:51,315
I don't.

647
00:37:52,521 --> 00:37:54,820
She would never
have let this happen

648
00:37:54,858 --> 00:37:57,019
had she known about it.

649
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,687
No, she never would have let it.

650
00:37:58,728 --> 00:38:01,561
She-she-
that was her babies.

651
00:38:01,598 --> 00:38:04,624
She wouldn't have put her babies
on display.

652
00:38:06,035 --> 00:38:08,526
But I don't think
she took all those photographs

653
00:38:08,571 --> 00:38:10,539
for them to just dissolve
into dust.

654
00:38:10,573 --> 00:38:14,407
I think she took
those photographs to be seen.

655
00:38:16,846 --> 00:38:21,579
I find the mystery of it
more interesting

656
00:38:21,618 --> 00:38:24,246
than her work itself.

657
00:38:24,287 --> 00:38:29,350
I'd love to know more
about this person.

658
00:38:31,127 --> 00:38:34,358
And I don't think you can
do that through her work.

659
00:38:34,397 --> 00:38:35,955
So she didn't tell you anything

660
00:38:35,999 --> 00:38:38,627
about where she came from,
her background?

661
00:38:38,668 --> 00:38:39,896
You didn't know anything?

662
00:38:39,936 --> 00:38:41,369
Nobody pried into that?

663
00:38:41,404 --> 00:38:44,202
No, I-not really.

664
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:48,677
Did you know anything
about Vivian...

665
00:38:48,711 --> 00:38:50,645
her family, her past?

666
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,680
No.

667
00:38:52,982 --> 00:38:53,982
It's amazing, isn't it,

668
00:38:53,983 --> 00:38:56,953
that you're friendly with
someone for, like, ten years

669
00:38:56,987 --> 00:39:00,115
and that you don't know
anything more about them than...

670
00:39:00,157 --> 00:39:01,886
this much?

671
00:39:02,927 --> 00:39:05,191
We always thought
she was French.

672
00:39:05,229 --> 00:39:07,527
Now, she's kind of, what,
Austrian?

673
00:39:07,564 --> 00:39:13,503
I mean, she's from Al-from
Alsace-Lorraine or something?

674
00:39:13,537 --> 00:39:15,198
She's from New York.

675
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:16,365
From New York?

676
00:39:16,407 --> 00:39:17,499
What do you mean, from New York?

677
00:39:17,541 --> 00:39:18,781
Well, she was born in New York.

678
00:39:18,809 --> 00:39:20,299
She was?

679
00:39:20,344 --> 00:39:21,868
She was born in New York.

680
00:39:21,912 --> 00:39:23,641
- No, really?
- Mm-hmm.

681
00:39:23,681 --> 00:39:25,342
Oh, I thought
she was born in Europe.

682
00:39:25,382 --> 00:39:27,748
I thought she was French.

683
00:39:27,785 --> 00:39:30,754
How did she acquire that accent?

684
00:39:35,225 --> 00:39:37,193
So...

685
00:39:37,227 --> 00:39:38,956
where's Vivian from?

686
00:39:38,996 --> 00:39:43,228
She's from New York City,
born February 1st of 1926.

687
00:39:43,267 --> 00:39:46,031
Speaking
from a professional standpoint,

688
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:48,766
compared to what I've done
in the past,

689
00:39:48,806 --> 00:39:53,175
this has ranked up real high
on the list of difficulty.

690
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:56,509
The families usually have
some consistency

691
00:39:56,547 --> 00:39:57,981
as to where they're located.

692
00:39:58,016 --> 00:40:00,211
I at least have them
in public record

693
00:40:00,251 --> 00:40:01,980
where I can find information
about them,

694
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,453
not like this one.

695
00:40:03,488 --> 00:40:06,184
The whole family
is a mystery family.

696
00:40:06,224 --> 00:40:08,954
There's a few things that
we know about Vivian Maier.

697
00:40:08,994 --> 00:40:10,586
One, we know
that she was never married.

698
00:40:10,628 --> 00:40:12,289
She was a spinster.

699
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:16,130
She had no husband.
She had no children.

700
00:40:16,167 --> 00:40:18,101
Her parents are both dead.

701
00:40:18,136 --> 00:40:20,400
Vivian did have a brother,
an older brother.

702
00:40:20,438 --> 00:40:23,032
Clearly, he's probably dead.

703
00:40:23,074 --> 00:40:24,939
All of them seem to be private.

704
00:40:24,976 --> 00:40:26,967
All of them seem to want
nothing to do

705
00:40:27,012 --> 00:40:28,479
with the rest of their families.

706
00:40:28,513 --> 00:40:30,413
All of them seem to be
disconnected

707
00:40:30,448 --> 00:40:32,712
from the remainder
of their family.

708
00:40:32,751 --> 00:40:35,777
She had one aunt
who was to leave everything

709
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:39,256
to a friend in her will.
Not to family but to a friend

710
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:40,780
and this is the reason why.

711
00:40:40,825 --> 00:40:44,192
She says here-and I'm quoting
directly from her will.

712
00:40:44,229 --> 00:40:48,563
"I make no provision
for any of my relatives

713
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,728
"for reasons best known to me

714
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:57,208
which I have disclosed to
a few of my intimate friends."

715
00:40:57,242 --> 00:41:00,303
At the time of Alma's death
in 1965,

716
00:41:00,346 --> 00:41:03,679
Vivian was obviously alive,
her only niece.

717
00:41:03,716 --> 00:41:08,050
Whatever her hang-up was,
it went to the grave with her.

718
00:41:08,087 --> 00:41:11,955
Vivian's father was out of
the picture very early on.

719
00:41:11,991 --> 00:41:17,019
So the census records show that
Vivian's living with her mother.

720
00:41:17,063 --> 00:41:19,691
But I did know that she lived
in France for a while

721
00:41:19,732 --> 00:41:21,859
and that her mother
was from France.

722
00:41:21,901 --> 00:41:25,098
So my guess was
that there was family in France,

723
00:41:25,137 --> 00:41:28,436
because the thing is,
the 1949 photos

724
00:41:28,474 --> 00:41:32,911
and the 1959 photos
are the same village.

725
00:41:32,945 --> 00:41:36,437
So I know she was returning
to the same place.

726
00:41:36,482 --> 00:41:38,541
So I started looking up all the
stuff that she had from France.

727
00:41:38,584 --> 00:41:41,712
I started looking
at the photographs of France,

728
00:41:41,754 --> 00:41:44,120
looking at the little towns
and the church steeples

729
00:41:44,156 --> 00:41:45,646
and how
this church steeple looks

730
00:41:45,691 --> 00:41:46,885
and how that
church steeple looks

731
00:41:46,926 --> 00:41:47,984
in this little village.

732
00:41:48,027 --> 00:41:49,392
And I would go on the internet,

733
00:41:49,428 --> 00:41:50,861
and I would look up
little villages in France

734
00:41:50,896 --> 00:41:52,158
and try to match the steeples.

735
00:41:52,198 --> 00:41:54,860
It's like matching
a fingerprint.

736
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,834
I knew I had
at least one of the villages

737
00:41:56,869 --> 00:41:59,201
that she was in found...

738
00:42:02,409 --> 00:42:04,775
Saint-Julien and Saint-Bonnet

739
00:42:04,811 --> 00:42:08,247
in this remote little
sheepherder village

740
00:42:08,281 --> 00:42:12,809
in the French Alps,
population 250.

741
00:42:14,488 --> 00:42:17,082
She might have been offended
that you found her little town.

742
00:42:17,124 --> 00:42:19,558
That was none of your business.

743
00:42:19,593 --> 00:42:22,960
She might say, "God, oh, God."

744
00:42:22,996 --> 00:42:25,226
Why did he do that?"

745
00:42:27,467 --> 00:42:30,994
For some reason,
my curiosity is overwhelming

746
00:42:31,037 --> 00:42:33,699
to find out more about Vivian.

747
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:36,504
I'm uncovering an artist.

748
00:42:36,543 --> 00:42:40,775
If I'm leaving
this giant boulder unturned

749
00:42:40,814 --> 00:42:44,306
because I don't go here,
it would be a mistake.

750
00:43:55,089 --> 00:43:56,089
Vivian took this.

751
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:58,183
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, 100%.

752
00:43:58,459 --> 00:44:00,654
I have this same print.

753
00:44:01,896 --> 00:44:04,490
Vivian took this picture.
This is her print.

754
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:11,270
He says, "Aren't you happy?"

755
00:44:11,306 --> 00:44:13,866
Oh, her box camera.

756
00:44:15,978 --> 00:44:17,502
I have-l have a similar one.

757
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,045
No, that's her mom's camera.

758
00:44:20,082 --> 00:44:21,947
Vivian's mom?

759
00:44:36,565 --> 00:44:38,032
- That's Vivian?
- Yes.

760
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:40,094
Wow.

761
00:44:43,939 --> 00:44:47,397
Another thing I found in
Vivian's stuff was this letter.

762
00:44:47,442 --> 00:44:49,307
It was written in French,

763
00:44:49,344 --> 00:44:53,303
and it's talking about
a photography lab in France.

764
00:45:03,792 --> 00:45:04,986
You can do like this.

765
00:45:05,027 --> 00:45:06,359
Oui, oui.

766
00:45:06,396 --> 00:45:09,490
The letter starts out,
"Dear Mr. Simon."

767
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:43,992
Ah, wow.

768
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:49,726
Previously, we thought
Vivian had no intentions

769
00:46:49,767 --> 00:46:53,294
of having anybody else print
her work or show her work.

770
00:46:53,337 --> 00:46:57,296
This letter proves
that assumption wrong.

771
00:46:57,341 --> 00:46:59,468
Vivian knew
she was a good photographer,

772
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:01,740
and she knew that these
photographs were good.

773
00:47:01,779 --> 00:47:04,373
She wanted to show them
to people.

774
00:47:04,415 --> 00:47:06,940
She may not have had that happen
while she was alive,

775
00:47:06,984 --> 00:47:09,920
but we're doing it now.

776
00:47:09,954 --> 00:47:12,149
I stopped scanning myself,

777
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:13,919
because I just couldn't keep up
with it.

778
00:47:19,431 --> 00:47:22,093
There's a lab in New York with
technicians scanning her work

779
00:47:22,133 --> 00:47:24,966
Monday through Friday,
9:00 to 5:00,

780
00:47:25,003 --> 00:47:28,769
at a rate of about
a few thousand a week.

781
00:47:28,807 --> 00:47:31,002
I've been developing
the black-and-white film,

782
00:47:31,042 --> 00:47:33,875
so I have about a couple hundred
left to develop.

783
00:47:36,881 --> 00:47:39,475
It's a very complicated
and tricky procedure,

784
00:47:39,517 --> 00:47:41,417
because you have to get
the formula correct,

785
00:47:41,453 --> 00:47:45,480
and there's only one chance
to get it right.

786
00:47:45,523 --> 00:47:49,084
It's-it's magical.

787
00:47:58,336 --> 00:48:02,432
We don't know
what she would have printed,

788
00:48:02,474 --> 00:48:04,567
what she would have chosen
or edited.

789
00:48:06,845 --> 00:48:08,938
We're seeing work now
for the first time

790
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:12,849
that Vivian never saw herself.

791
00:48:12,885 --> 00:48:16,912
When you contacted me,
I wasn't sure

792
00:48:16,956 --> 00:48:19,652
if I wanted to get involved
in a project

793
00:48:19,692 --> 00:48:21,819
with posthumous prints.

794
00:48:21,861 --> 00:48:25,024
I just didn't think it would be
the right fit for the gallery.

795
00:48:25,064 --> 00:48:27,328
This is the room where we store
our photographs.

796
00:48:27,366 --> 00:48:30,358
I think there are about 25,000
to 30,000 photographs in here.

797
00:48:30,402 --> 00:48:33,769
I mean, it's more
than most museums have.

798
00:48:33,806 --> 00:48:37,435
Vivian Maier, we've had
more interest in this work

799
00:48:37,476 --> 00:48:40,070
than perhaps
any other photographer

800
00:48:40,112 --> 00:48:41,875
I've ever worked with.

801
00:48:48,754 --> 00:48:49,982
It's a big problem

802
00:48:50,022 --> 00:48:52,718
trying to get her work
into institutions.

803
00:48:52,758 --> 00:48:55,420
The problem is that
the art world establishment

804
00:48:55,461 --> 00:48:58,328
still won't recognize
Vivian's work.

805
00:48:58,364 --> 00:49:02,061
Museums usually deal with
the final product,

806
00:49:02,101 --> 00:49:03,932
the print that was made
by the artist

807
00:49:03,969 --> 00:49:06,767
in the artist's life.

808
00:49:06,805 --> 00:49:09,899
They don't want to interpret
an artist's work

809
00:49:09,942 --> 00:49:11,967
from where they left off.

810
00:49:13,446 --> 00:49:16,074
That's bogus,
because Garry Winogrand

811
00:49:16,116 --> 00:49:19,916
had a desk full of rolls of film
that he never developed.

812
00:49:19,953 --> 00:49:21,750
So they're developing them.

813
00:49:21,788 --> 00:49:25,019
Eugne Atget's work was printed
after his death

814
00:49:25,058 --> 00:49:27,458
and then ended up being acquired
by MoMA.

815
00:49:27,494 --> 00:49:31,362
I mean, it's frustrating,
because it's being done, and...

816
00:49:31,398 --> 00:49:34,094
but nobody wants to do it
for Vivian's work.

817
00:49:34,134 --> 00:49:36,159
She did print some of her work,

818
00:49:36,202 --> 00:49:41,071
but it was largely not
the best edit of her work.

819
00:49:41,107 --> 00:49:44,042
She was
a masterful photographer,

820
00:49:44,077 --> 00:49:47,569
but printing was not her thing.

821
00:49:48,982 --> 00:49:49,982
That's common, though.

822
00:49:50,016 --> 00:49:52,143
I mean, Cartier-Bresson
hated printing,

823
00:49:52,185 --> 00:49:54,517
and Robert Frank
wasn't a good printer,

824
00:49:54,554 --> 00:49:56,419
but they hire printers.

825
00:49:56,456 --> 00:49:59,584
They hire somebody
to print for them.

826
00:49:59,626 --> 00:50:01,685
Good work is good work,

827
00:50:01,728 --> 00:50:04,788
and it's recognized
that this is really great art.

828
00:50:04,831 --> 00:50:07,629
I do think her work needs to be
appreciated by-by the world.

829
00:50:11,037 --> 00:50:12,265
These are the new prints?

830
00:50:12,305 --> 00:50:13,329
Yeah.

831
00:50:13,373 --> 00:50:14,533
Cool.
Yeah, these are great.

832
00:50:14,574 --> 00:50:15,837
Thank you for showing me.

833
00:50:15,876 --> 00:50:17,468
They're yours.

834
00:50:17,511 --> 00:50:20,036
The only way
this work can move forward

835
00:50:20,081 --> 00:50:21,810
is if there's money
that is made.

836
00:50:21,849 --> 00:50:25,114
The sale of prints
will be a part of that.

837
00:50:29,757 --> 00:50:35,195
Of course I wish
that I could give her money,

838
00:50:35,229 --> 00:50:36,856
you know.

839
00:50:36,897 --> 00:50:37,921
She's gone.

840
00:50:37,965 --> 00:50:40,525
I mean,
there's nothing I can do.

841
00:50:40,568 --> 00:50:43,435
She always had a money problem.

842
00:50:43,471 --> 00:50:45,336
God knows she probably
could have used the money.

843
00:50:45,373 --> 00:50:48,069
It's too bad she wasn't
discovered ten years earlier.

844
00:50:57,952 --> 00:50:59,214
Marble.

845
00:51:00,988 --> 00:51:03,422
Yeah, you two.

846
00:51:05,092 --> 00:51:08,755
Here's the picture of
Miss Maiers right in the corner.

847
00:51:08,796 --> 00:51:11,356
And I wouldn't call her
"Vivian", because,

848
00:51:11,399 --> 00:51:12,627
you know, she'd have your guts
for garters

849
00:51:12,667 --> 00:51:13,964
if you called her that.

850
00:51:14,001 --> 00:51:16,128
Not "Missus", not "Vivian."

851
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:18,139
She was Miss Maiers.

852
00:51:18,173 --> 00:51:21,939
She was my governess
from when I was 5 years old

853
00:51:21,977 --> 00:51:24,673
up until
I was about 11 years old.

854
00:51:24,713 --> 00:51:26,943
I've got in my baby book
the exact date.

855
00:51:26,982 --> 00:51:32,648
It was, like, March of '67
until about 1974.

856
00:51:32,688 --> 00:51:34,383
Inger and I were best friends,

857
00:51:34,423 --> 00:51:38,860
and so I would spend a lot
of time with Miss Maier.

858
00:51:38,894 --> 00:51:41,362
She would take us
down to the city,

859
00:51:41,396 --> 00:51:43,455
and we would just walk

860
00:51:43,498 --> 00:51:45,227
in the worst parts of town.

861
00:51:45,267 --> 00:51:47,428
She'd walk very quickly,
and so I had

862
00:51:47,469 --> 00:51:49,903
my little legs had to fly
to keep up with her.

863
00:51:49,938 --> 00:51:52,304
She would swing her arm
just like this.

864
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:56,037
And then her stride
was just massive.

865
00:51:56,078 --> 00:51:58,546
Inger used to just beg her
to slow down,

866
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:01,208
and she would just drag her
alongside.

867
00:52:01,249 --> 00:52:03,114
The poor thing.

868
00:52:03,151 --> 00:52:05,312
She'd take pictures
of everything.

869
00:52:05,353 --> 00:52:08,914
She would see a subject,

870
00:52:08,957 --> 00:52:11,050
something that would
interest her.

871
00:52:11,093 --> 00:52:13,391
She'd open her camera.

872
00:52:13,428 --> 00:52:15,726
She'd focus it.

873
00:52:15,764 --> 00:52:17,459
These poor, you know, people,

874
00:52:17,499 --> 00:52:21,129
and she would literally ask them
to, like, pose for her.

875
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:23,104
She didn't tend to pose people.

876
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:24,539
She's like, "Stand there.
Wait."

877
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:26,269
it was just the way it was.

878
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:28,436
- Impoverished people.
- Take a picture.

879
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:31,606
- Or somebody crying.
- It was just, "Bam!"

880
00:52:32,648 --> 00:52:33,979
They would...

881
00:52:34,016 --> 00:52:36,849
You know, like, "Oh, my God,
what is this woman doing?"

882
00:52:36,886 --> 00:52:38,615
We would joke about
how we wanted to hit her

883
00:52:38,654 --> 00:52:39,814
over the head with the camera

884
00:52:39,856 --> 00:52:41,653
because she embarrassed us
so much.

885
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:44,421
It was imposing and rude.

886
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:48,294
They felt, I'm sure, that they
were being mocked in some way.

887
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:49,798
I'm surprised
she didn't get shot.

888
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:52,400
My mom put her foot down

889
00:52:52,435 --> 00:52:55,268
and wouldn't let Miss Maier
take me into the slum areas.

890
00:52:57,373 --> 00:52:59,364
She loved to read the paper.

891
00:52:59,408 --> 00:53:01,376
She liked it that we took
The New York Times,

892
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:02,809
and she read it every day,

893
00:53:02,845 --> 00:53:05,370
and she always had an eye
for the bizarre,

894
00:53:05,414 --> 00:53:08,315
the grotesque, the incongruous.

895
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:11,377
She wasn't interested
in sweetness and light.

896
00:53:16,459 --> 00:53:18,620
She liked headlines

897
00:53:18,661 --> 00:53:23,224
that revealed the folly
of individuals,

898
00:53:23,267 --> 00:53:26,100
stories that would enable her
to basically say,

899
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:29,537
"I told you so.
I told you so."

900
00:53:29,573 --> 00:53:32,371
Some man murders his wife

901
00:53:32,409 --> 00:53:33,769
and then gets caught
in cold blood:

902
00:53:33,777 --> 00:53:35,142
"I told you so."

903
00:53:35,179 --> 00:53:39,013
I mean, these things that
revealed the folly of humanity.

904
00:53:58,468 --> 00:54:03,735
If you look at her art, she sees
the bizarreness of life,

905
00:54:03,774 --> 00:54:06,334
the incongruity of life,

906
00:54:06,376 --> 00:54:10,107
and the unappealingness
of human beings.

907
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:15,852
There were little things
all the time

908
00:54:15,886 --> 00:54:21,985
that she was just plain,
in microscopic ways,

909
00:54:22,026 --> 00:54:26,087
just chipping at me
all the time.

910
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:29,930
I would go down
with my allowance money

911
00:54:29,968 --> 00:54:33,426
to the craft store
and buy myself

912
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:36,998
a thousand little, tiny,
you know, like, rainbows and...

913
00:54:37,041 --> 00:54:40,738
Glass tchotchkes.

914
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:45,147
Viv would look at my trove
of tchotchkes and hate it.

915
00:54:45,183 --> 00:54:48,277
She would get a big mop bucket,

916
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:51,015
and she would fill it
with hot, soapy water, yes,

917
00:54:51,055 --> 00:54:52,613
and ammonia,

918
00:54:52,657 --> 00:54:55,854
and she would have the ammonia
be such a strength

919
00:54:55,894 --> 00:54:58,055
that you couldn't be near
the bucket.

920
00:54:58,096 --> 00:55:00,326
Clearly,
to need that much ammonia,

921
00:55:00,365 --> 00:55:04,301
you would surely be cleaning
something very, very dirty.

922
00:55:07,071 --> 00:55:10,336
She would take her arm

923
00:55:10,375 --> 00:55:14,038
and just swipe all
the tchotchkes into the bucket,

924
00:55:14,078 --> 00:55:16,103
and they're crashing
and grinding together

925
00:55:16,147 --> 00:55:17,478
and smashing,

926
00:55:17,515 --> 00:55:19,847
and then they're all covered
in ammonia.

927
00:55:23,288 --> 00:55:26,190
Me, I sort of just
quietly tolerated

928
00:55:26,225 --> 00:55:28,284
whatever was happening to me
in my life.

929
00:55:28,327 --> 00:55:30,989
My brother acted out,
and I don't think

930
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:34,557
that she had good ways of coping
with his behavior.

931
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:37,467
She, uh, sort of ditched us.

932
00:55:37,503 --> 00:55:38,970
We were all taking
a walk together,

933
00:55:39,004 --> 00:55:42,804
and she would duck down an alley
and just disappear.

934
00:55:42,841 --> 00:55:46,777
The police finally found us.

935
00:55:46,812 --> 00:55:49,144
I think she wanted to scare us.

936
00:55:49,181 --> 00:55:51,445
And I remember getting lectured
by the police like,

937
00:55:51,483 --> 00:55:53,644
"You can't leave
your babysitter"

938
00:55:53,686 --> 00:55:56,246
and me saying, "No, no."

939
00:55:56,288 --> 00:55:58,313
My babysitter left me."

940
00:56:00,793 --> 00:56:04,661
There were some accidents,
which I knew weren't accidents,

941
00:56:04,697 --> 00:56:07,757
that everybody knew
weren't really accidents,

942
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,825
where all of a sudden, there's
a kid screaming in the basement

943
00:56:09,868 --> 00:56:11,358
with the door shut
and the lights off.

944
00:56:11,403 --> 00:56:13,530
Yeah, that kind of thing.

945
00:56:13,572 --> 00:56:15,437
She was mean.

946
00:56:15,474 --> 00:56:16,754
I don't know how else to say it.

947
00:56:16,775 --> 00:56:19,243
I don't know;
she had, like, a dark side.

948
00:56:19,278 --> 00:56:22,770
I remember one time
she said, uh,

949
00:56:22,815 --> 00:56:25,842
"These men, " they'll have you
sit on their laps,

950
00:56:25,885 --> 00:56:28,979
and then you'll feel something
poking you."

951
00:56:30,824 --> 00:56:32,052
And I can't even remember
the context

952
00:56:32,092 --> 00:56:34,060
of when she said that,
but it just was,

953
00:56:34,094 --> 00:56:36,358
she had this, like, anger in her
towards men,

954
00:56:36,396 --> 00:56:38,421
and now I know exactly
what she was talking about,

955
00:56:38,465 --> 00:56:41,161
but as a kid, I really-
I knew what she was saying

956
00:56:41,201 --> 00:56:43,567
was dark and a little not right.

957
00:56:52,912 --> 00:56:54,709
I've seen her more than once

958
00:56:54,748 --> 00:56:58,081
jump back in fear, you know,
from a man.

959
00:56:58,118 --> 00:57:00,586
She said several times
over several years,

960
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:03,111
men, all they were out to do
was ruin you.

961
00:57:03,156 --> 00:57:06,023
Stay away from them.
Be careful of them.

962
00:57:06,059 --> 00:57:09,085
You know,
that all they want is sex.

963
00:57:09,129 --> 00:57:14,260
She was always afraid
of being touched.

964
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:16,700
I remember she was standing up
on a stump,

965
00:57:16,736 --> 00:57:19,671
taking a picture
of some sort of incident.

966
00:57:19,706 --> 00:57:21,901
The man apparently thought
she was falling.

967
00:57:21,941 --> 00:57:25,468
He reached up, and all she saw
was a man reaching for her,

968
00:57:25,512 --> 00:57:27,140
and she decked him.

969
00:57:27,181 --> 00:57:30,275
She thought he was attacking her

970
00:57:30,317 --> 00:57:34,549
and gave him a concussion,
sent him to the hospital.

971
00:57:35,456 --> 00:57:37,287
I would bet money

972
00:57:37,324 --> 00:57:41,886
that she was, um, brutalized
in some way,

973
00:57:41,929 --> 00:57:46,093
attacked in some-l mean, or,
you know, molested, whatever.

974
00:57:46,133 --> 00:57:47,498
I hate to say that,

975
00:57:47,535 --> 00:57:49,867
but something happened to her
that was awful,

976
00:57:49,904 --> 00:57:53,396
because nobody would act
like the way she did.

977
00:57:54,108 --> 00:57:55,302
I remember some of

978
00:57:55,342 --> 00:57:57,139
the more strong emotion things,
I'm afraid.

979
00:57:57,178 --> 00:58:02,480
It's harder to remember
some of the other, um...

980
00:58:05,886 --> 00:58:08,514
I don't know if you want to go
into this, but I will.

981
00:58:08,556 --> 00:58:09,853
I will.

982
00:58:12,393 --> 00:58:14,827
I mean, there were things
that happened to me

983
00:58:14,862 --> 00:58:17,831
that were not good.

984
00:58:17,865 --> 00:58:22,768
Miss Maier was force-feeding me,
forcing me to eat

985
00:58:22,803 --> 00:58:25,294
'cause I wasn't finishing all
on my plate.

986
00:58:25,339 --> 00:58:28,433
My parents found out,
and my dad got angry.

987
00:58:28,477 --> 00:58:31,105
But if my dad found out
exactly how,

988
00:58:31,146 --> 00:58:33,376
it would have been worse.

989
00:58:33,415 --> 00:58:35,713
She would hold me down,

990
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:37,843
she would shove the food
in my throat,

991
00:58:37,886 --> 00:58:41,652
and then she would choke me
until I would swallow it.

992
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:44,818
And she would do that
over and over again.

993
00:58:48,530 --> 00:58:51,624
There was very much
of a dark side to her

994
00:58:51,666 --> 00:58:54,362
that I have not gone into.

995
00:58:56,571 --> 00:58:59,039
She would lose it sometimes.

996
00:58:59,074 --> 00:59:00,632
I think the first time
she hit me

997
00:59:00,675 --> 00:59:02,506
was when I was five years old

998
00:59:02,544 --> 00:59:07,641
'cause I was trying to learn
to tie my shoelaces,

999
00:59:07,682 --> 00:59:09,081
and I wasn't doing it right,

1000
00:59:09,117 --> 00:59:10,641
and she got very frustrated
with me,

1001
00:59:10,685 --> 00:59:12,846
and so she started slamming
my head

1002
00:59:12,888 --> 00:59:15,322
into the side of this bookcase.

1003
00:59:15,357 --> 00:59:16,917
I mean, she wouldn't hit me
in the face.

1004
00:59:16,958 --> 00:59:19,552
Obviously,
I didn't have bruises there,

1005
00:59:19,594 --> 00:59:21,789
but she'd grab me by the wrists
and swing me around the room

1006
00:59:21,830 --> 00:59:23,297
and slam me into things

1007
00:59:23,331 --> 00:59:25,526
when she got really upset
about something.

1008
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:30,198
And I was eight years old
before I could break her grip.

1009
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:31,501
After that,
she didn't do that again.

1010
00:59:31,541 --> 00:59:33,907
I was strong enough.

1011
00:59:35,778 --> 00:59:39,544
I mean, she was
a brilliant person,

1012
00:59:39,582 --> 00:59:43,040
and I think she really cared,
and I think she tried,

1013
00:59:43,085 --> 00:59:44,780
and I don't know
if any of the others

1014
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:47,448
will ever talk about that,
if it ever happened to them.

1015
00:59:47,490 --> 00:59:49,050
I don't know.
Maybe she got it together.

1016
00:59:49,091 --> 00:59:50,922
I'm hoping she did.

1017
00:59:56,432 --> 00:59:58,232
I really hate saying
these things about her,

1018
00:59:58,267 --> 00:59:59,859
because I've always felt guilty

1019
00:59:59,902 --> 01:00:02,132
about not keeping Viv
for longer.

1020
01:00:02,171 --> 01:00:03,968
My husband and I
were talking then

1021
01:00:04,006 --> 01:00:06,031
about having a foster child.

1022
01:00:06,075 --> 01:00:08,669
Viv said, "if you want
to take care of somebody",

1023
01:00:08,711 --> 01:00:10,679
why don't you take care of me?"

1024
01:00:10,713 --> 01:00:13,443
And then she kind of laughed,
but she meant it.

1025
01:00:13,482 --> 01:00:18,317
I think she really wanted
to be brought in

1026
01:00:18,354 --> 01:00:24,156
to be a member of our family,
but that...

1027
01:00:24,193 --> 01:00:27,060
wasn't really
what I had bargained for.

1028
01:00:32,436 --> 01:00:34,961
So there it is.

1029
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:44,511
In this little house,
Miss Maiers lived upstairs.

1030
01:00:44,548 --> 01:00:48,348
My father did provide a room
for her above his office.

1031
01:00:48,385 --> 01:00:51,752
I only had a chance
to see it once,

1032
01:00:51,788 --> 01:00:54,279
back when I snuck up behind her,

1033
01:00:54,324 --> 01:00:56,315
'cause she kept a padlock on it.

1034
01:00:59,162 --> 01:01:01,392
So, yeah,
this is totally different.

1035
01:01:04,001 --> 01:01:05,491
This was the forbidden zone.

1036
01:01:05,535 --> 01:01:08,003
No one was allowed to see
where Miss Maiers lived.

1037
01:01:08,038 --> 01:01:10,836
Huh.

1038
01:01:10,874 --> 01:01:12,569
Miss Maier went in there,

1039
01:01:12,609 --> 01:01:15,009
and she left the door
open enough for me to see,

1040
01:01:15,045 --> 01:01:17,775
and the room was literally
filled, floor to ceiling,

1041
01:01:17,814 --> 01:01:19,042
with newspapers.

1042
01:01:19,082 --> 01:01:21,550
See how the floor is sloped?

1043
01:01:21,585 --> 01:01:22,916
I told my dad, and he said,

1044
01:01:22,953 --> 01:01:24,887
"Oh, that's why the floor
is sagging so much."

1045
01:01:24,921 --> 01:01:27,583
He ended up having to put
a steel I-beam post

1046
01:01:27,624 --> 01:01:30,058
in his office
because the floor was sagging.

1047
01:01:30,093 --> 01:01:31,117
He didn't know why.

1048
01:01:31,161 --> 01:01:33,186
It was just totally full.

1049
01:01:38,936 --> 01:01:41,996
This floor was Viv's domain.

1050
01:01:43,107 --> 01:01:45,974
It occurred to me that maybe
I would need to go up there

1051
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:47,637
when she wasn't home,

1052
01:01:47,679 --> 01:01:53,083
so she grudgingly gave me a key,
and so I went in.

1053
01:01:53,117 --> 01:01:56,746
You can tell
where she had been walking,

1054
01:01:56,788 --> 01:01:58,619
and it was just this narrow path

1055
01:01:58,656 --> 01:02:01,989
that you could just barely
traverse like this.

1056
01:02:02,026 --> 01:02:03,516
And where would the bed
have been?

1057
01:02:03,561 --> 01:02:04,789
Right here.

1058
01:02:04,829 --> 01:02:07,889
Stacks of newspapers
almost to the ceiling.

1059
01:02:11,636 --> 01:02:13,228
You may think I'm exaggerating.

1060
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:16,138
No, I am not.

1061
01:02:33,825 --> 01:02:36,852
Just stacked, stacked, stacked,
stacked, stacked,

1062
01:02:36,895 --> 01:02:38,556
stacked everywhere.

1063
01:02:38,597 --> 01:02:42,055
High-you know,
high stacks of paper.

1064
01:02:42,101 --> 01:02:44,934
How she even could get
to the paper...

1065
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:48,770
I don't even know how much
she even looked at the paper.

1066
01:02:56,248 --> 01:02:58,307
I began to see that she was
stacking newspaper

1067
01:02:58,350 --> 01:03:01,148
elsewhere in the house,
in the basement,

1068
01:03:01,186 --> 01:03:03,984
and in the back, we have
a little back entryway,

1069
01:03:04,022 --> 01:03:06,616
and she would stack newspaper
out there.

1070
01:03:06,658 --> 01:03:08,387
Now, the idea was always

1071
01:03:08,427 --> 01:03:11,191
that there were articles
she wanted to save

1072
01:03:11,230 --> 01:03:12,697
for the day when she did
get around

1073
01:03:12,731 --> 01:03:16,724
to cutting out the parts
that she wanted to keep.

1074
01:03:16,769 --> 01:03:20,261
It concerned me, but...

1075
01:03:20,305 --> 01:03:25,470
I thought, "Whatever.
Whatever."

1076
01:03:25,511 --> 01:03:28,207
Um...

1077
01:03:29,548 --> 01:03:33,985
I gave her a ride
to her place of employment.

1078
01:03:34,019 --> 01:03:37,717
I looked at her desk
and piles of stuff there.

1079
01:03:37,757 --> 01:03:40,590
She was certain
that her employers

1080
01:03:40,627 --> 01:03:44,256
were coming into the room
she had

1081
01:03:44,297 --> 01:03:48,028
and going through her items.

1082
01:03:48,067 --> 01:03:52,663
She would rig the books
and so forth on her desk

1083
01:03:52,705 --> 01:03:56,971
so that if they were moved
half an inch,

1084
01:03:57,010 --> 01:03:59,001
she would know that
when she got back.

1085
01:03:59,045 --> 01:04:01,980
Or so that was Vivian's story.

1086
01:04:02,015 --> 01:04:03,573
And she was also certain

1087
01:04:03,616 --> 01:04:07,313
that people were looking
through binoculars

1088
01:04:07,353 --> 01:04:11,119
and could see through the window
of her room.

1089
01:04:13,193 --> 01:04:15,787
She was progressively getting
more and more reclusive,

1090
01:04:15,829 --> 01:04:17,160
more and more of a hoarder.

1091
01:04:17,197 --> 01:04:19,529
Everybody was saying
resoundingly, "Oh, my God."

1092
01:04:19,566 --> 01:04:21,557
You've got to get rid
of your nanny."

1093
01:04:21,601 --> 01:04:24,536
I don't think that Mom and Dad
really realized

1094
01:04:24,571 --> 01:04:29,270
the extent to which she was
living with mental illness,

1095
01:04:29,309 --> 01:04:30,708
'cause she was.

1096
01:04:30,743 --> 01:04:32,904
She was.
She was.

1097
01:04:32,946 --> 01:04:36,939
She-she, um...

1098
01:04:39,487 --> 01:04:42,456
Yeah, it was a little past
eccentric.

1099
01:04:42,490 --> 01:04:43,957
My neighbor came over.

1100
01:04:43,991 --> 01:04:45,083
He said,
"I'm painting the bathroom.

1101
01:04:45,125 --> 01:04:46,490
Do you have a stack
of newspaper?"

1102
01:04:46,527 --> 01:04:47,789
I said, "Sure."

1103
01:04:47,828 --> 01:04:49,227
There was a huge stack
right by the back door.

1104
01:04:49,263 --> 01:04:51,128
I gave him a big chunk
like this.

1105
01:04:51,165 --> 01:04:52,632
I said, "Sure. Go ahead."

1106
01:04:52,666 --> 01:04:55,134
Well, when Viv came home,
she saw

1107
01:04:55,169 --> 01:04:57,831
that that stack of newspaper
was shorter

1108
01:04:57,872 --> 01:04:59,897
by three feet or two feet
or whatever,

1109
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:03,171
and she was angry and horrified.

1110
01:05:03,210 --> 01:05:06,236
"Who took my papers?
Who took my papers?"

1111
01:05:07,815 --> 01:05:09,612
And she just went berserk.

1112
01:05:09,650 --> 01:05:11,083
I mean, she went crazy.

1113
01:05:11,118 --> 01:05:14,349
I remember an outside scene
with screaming and yelling

1114
01:05:14,388 --> 01:05:17,516
where she's yelling at this guy,
telling him to bring them back,

1115
01:05:17,558 --> 01:05:20,356
but some already had paint
on them and were ripped.

1116
01:05:20,394 --> 01:05:22,191
"Now they're all covered
with paint!

1117
01:05:22,229 --> 01:05:23,753
"Now I can't use those papers.

1118
01:05:23,797 --> 01:05:24,991
"They're covered with paint now.

1119
01:05:25,032 --> 01:05:27,296
How could you give him
my papers?"

1120
01:05:28,435 --> 01:05:31,165
So I said-l just said,
"Viv, those aren't your papers.

1121
01:05:31,205 --> 01:05:32,900
"Those are my papers,

1122
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:34,805
and there are too many papers
in this house."

1123
01:05:34,842 --> 01:05:37,743
I remember my parents
telling me,

1124
01:05:37,778 --> 01:05:40,303
"Viv's not gonna be with us
anymore.

1125
01:05:40,348 --> 01:05:43,181
She's gotten too crazy."

1126
01:05:43,218 --> 01:05:45,345
Like, not that she wasn't
already crazy

1127
01:05:45,387 --> 01:05:47,287
but that the craziness
has increased

1128
01:05:47,322 --> 01:05:49,984
to a level that we can't
tolerate anymore.

1129
01:05:50,025 --> 01:05:54,655
I remember so clearly
having to say to her, "Viv",

1130
01:05:54,696 --> 01:05:56,994
I think you're going to have
to look for another job."

1131
01:05:57,032 --> 01:05:59,466
How hard it was
to say that to her.

1132
01:05:59,501 --> 01:06:00,593
But you know what?

1133
01:06:00,635 --> 01:06:03,195
I don't think
she was even surprised.

1134
01:06:03,238 --> 01:06:04,899
She looked back at me,
and she said,

1135
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:06,635
"Do you?" she said.

1136
01:06:06,675 --> 01:06:08,006
"Do you?" she said.

1137
01:06:08,043 --> 01:06:14,312
"Well, then, what I want
is two months' notice

1138
01:06:14,349 --> 01:06:17,113
and two months' pay"
or something like that.

1139
01:06:17,152 --> 01:06:19,712
She gave me her-sort of
what she wanted

1140
01:06:19,754 --> 01:06:21,449
as if she had it
on the tip of her tongue

1141
01:06:21,489 --> 01:06:22,956
and she'd figured it out.

1142
01:06:22,991 --> 01:06:24,959
And I didn't know whether
that was because

1143
01:06:24,993 --> 01:06:27,325
she had been dismissed
from positions often enough

1144
01:06:27,362 --> 01:06:30,923
that she knew what to say

1145
01:06:30,966 --> 01:06:35,130
or whether she had, in a way,
anticipated it.

1146
01:06:35,170 --> 01:06:37,434
My husband and I
and our children,

1147
01:06:37,472 --> 01:06:40,339
after she was gone, do you know
we just jumped in the car

1148
01:06:40,375 --> 01:06:41,740
and drove up to Michigan,

1149
01:06:41,776 --> 01:06:43,836
which is something
we never used to do,

1150
01:06:43,879 --> 01:06:46,245
just because it was
a huge emotional thing

1151
01:06:46,282 --> 01:06:48,216
not to have her-

1152
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:50,047
you know, see,
I'm still weepy about it,

1153
01:06:50,086 --> 01:06:51,986
because I really cared
about Viv,

1154
01:06:52,021 --> 01:06:54,148
and I think she cared about us,

1155
01:06:54,190 --> 01:06:55,885
and it was just
one of those things

1156
01:06:55,925 --> 01:07:02,296
where she was a person
who didn't fit in very well.

1157
01:07:02,331 --> 01:07:05,528
She just had those edges
that couldn't-

1158
01:07:05,568 --> 01:07:08,696
and I think we-
well, I flatter myself.

1159
01:07:08,738 --> 01:07:12,868
I think we were one of
the most sympathetic, accepting,

1160
01:07:12,908 --> 01:07:15,672
and congenial families
that she worked with.

1161
01:07:15,711 --> 01:07:19,272
I don't know that.
I think it may be true.

1162
01:07:19,315 --> 01:07:21,408
And we couldn't make it work.

1163
01:07:26,555 --> 01:07:32,892
In 1996, we were getting my
mother's house ready for sale,

1164
01:07:32,928 --> 01:07:35,055
and when I told Vivian, I said,

1165
01:07:35,097 --> 01:07:37,531
"You can stay here
for a couple of months.

1166
01:07:37,566 --> 01:07:39,295
"I won't put it
on the market yet.

1167
01:07:39,335 --> 01:07:40,768
"You know,
we have to get things ready,

1168
01:07:40,803 --> 01:07:43,533
"and, you know,
I'm not kicking you out.

1169
01:07:43,572 --> 01:07:45,973
You can stay."

1170
01:07:46,009 --> 01:07:49,445
Vivian was to be there,
you know, and to show it,

1171
01:07:49,479 --> 01:07:52,277
but she was not at all helpful
with the real estate people.

1172
01:07:52,315 --> 01:07:54,306
She just didn't want
to let them in.

1173
01:07:54,351 --> 01:07:55,716
They were calling me saying

1174
01:07:55,752 --> 01:07:59,586
she won't let them
show the house, you know.

1175
01:07:59,623 --> 01:08:02,217
"You've got to do something,
Judy."

1176
01:08:02,259 --> 01:08:04,250
So I would call her and say,
"Vivian, you know,

1177
01:08:04,294 --> 01:08:06,091
you have to let people see
the house."

1178
01:08:07,864 --> 01:08:11,527
They did manage to get in,
and they did manage to sell.

1179
01:08:11,568 --> 01:08:14,731
I think we closed
the last day of the year.

1180
01:08:18,542 --> 01:08:21,238
The lawyer called and said,
"Judy, we're just afraid

1181
01:08:21,278 --> 01:08:22,438
she's not gonna be out."

1182
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:23,599
And I said, "She'll be out."

1183
01:08:23,613 --> 01:08:25,308
Don't worry.
She will be out."

1184
01:08:50,308 --> 01:08:55,974
The last time I saw her, um,
I'm still unhappy about.

1185
01:08:56,013 --> 01:09:00,507
It must have been, like,
probably 2000.

1186
01:09:00,551 --> 01:09:03,213
I was in Wilmette, going
to the beach with my daughter,

1187
01:09:03,254 --> 01:09:06,519
her children, and four other
children of a friend's.

1188
01:09:06,557 --> 01:09:08,752
It was a hot summer day,
like August,

1189
01:09:08,793 --> 01:09:11,193
like 100-degree day,
and all of a sudden,

1190
01:09:11,229 --> 01:09:13,254
I see this woman
walking down the street,

1191
01:09:13,297 --> 01:09:15,561
and immediately we're like,
"There's Vivian."

1192
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:18,125
I hadn't seen her in 30 years,

1193
01:09:18,169 --> 01:09:21,798
but we recognized each other
at once.

1194
01:09:23,674 --> 01:09:25,471
And we both, "Oh, hi."

1195
01:09:25,510 --> 01:09:27,171
"How are you, Vivian?"
and "How are you, Carole?"

1196
01:09:27,211 --> 01:09:29,771
And "it's been so long."

1197
01:09:29,814 --> 01:09:31,907
We're like, "Well, it was
great, you know, to see you."

1198
01:09:31,949 --> 01:09:34,941
And we said,
"We have to get going."

1199
01:09:34,986 --> 01:09:36,248
And she was like,
"Please don't leave."

1200
01:09:36,287 --> 01:09:37,379
You know, she was like,
"Carole"-

1201
01:09:37,421 --> 01:09:38,683
you know, my mother's name.

1202
01:09:38,723 --> 01:09:41,487
She was like,
"Carole, please don't leave."

1203
01:09:41,526 --> 01:09:43,391
You know, when you're with
a bunch of kids

1204
01:09:43,427 --> 01:09:44,758
and they're swirling around you

1205
01:09:44,796 --> 01:09:46,354
and they want to go to the beach

1206
01:09:46,397 --> 01:09:49,026
and it's a hot summer day,
you know, you're, like, stuck.

1207
01:09:49,067 --> 01:09:50,796
And she kept saying,
"Talk to me.

1208
01:09:50,836 --> 01:09:52,269
Let's talk.
Let's talk."

1209
01:09:52,304 --> 01:09:54,704
And I kept saying,
"I can't do it, Vivian.

1210
01:09:54,740 --> 01:09:56,173
I have to go.
I have to go."

1211
01:09:56,208 --> 01:09:57,768
She kept saying,
"But you're my friend.

1212
01:09:57,810 --> 01:09:58,936
You're my friend."

1213
01:10:01,413 --> 01:10:05,144
And, um, I dropped the ball.

1214
01:10:05,184 --> 01:10:06,617
That's all I can say.

1215
01:10:06,652 --> 01:10:08,449
I feel badly about it,

1216
01:10:08,487 --> 01:10:14,551
and the despair in her voice
about seeing a friend,

1217
01:10:14,593 --> 01:10:17,721
and I feel that I let her down.

1218
01:10:17,763 --> 01:10:20,231
So I proceeded to go
to the beach with the kids.

1219
01:10:20,265 --> 01:10:22,233
I said, "Follow us,"
but she didn't want to do that,

1220
01:10:22,267 --> 01:10:25,668
so that was the end of that one.

1221
01:10:25,704 --> 01:10:28,935
I do remember once

1222
01:10:28,974 --> 01:10:30,373
she wouldn't tell me
where we were going.

1223
01:10:30,409 --> 01:10:32,343
"I don't want to tell you.
It's a surprise."

1224
01:10:32,377 --> 01:10:35,278
She took me to the stockyards.

1225
01:10:37,416 --> 01:10:41,182
It didn't come
into my consciousness that,

1226
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:44,155
"Well, this is where they go
to kill the animals."

1227
01:10:46,258 --> 01:10:50,252
There was a trailer
full of sheep.

1228
01:10:51,998 --> 01:10:55,195
I do remember guys
poking at them with sticks

1229
01:10:55,235 --> 01:10:57,931
to get them out
down this long ramp.

1230
01:10:59,372 --> 01:11:01,636
After they were done
offloading the sheep,

1231
01:11:01,674 --> 01:11:04,973
they started throwing out
a dead sheep,

1232
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:07,502
one that got trampled.

1233
01:11:09,115 --> 01:11:12,050
That was the first time
I ever saw death.

1234
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:17,656
Looking back, thinking about it,
it didn't bother me.

1235
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:20,989
It was just kind of odd.
I couldn't understand it.

1236
01:11:23,563 --> 01:11:25,326
I've always been
a critter person,

1237
01:11:25,365 --> 01:11:28,198
and these are my guys,
the sheep.

1238
01:11:31,971 --> 01:11:34,667
The end of her life was
something that I worried about

1239
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:36,766
when she worked for me.

1240
01:11:36,809 --> 01:11:39,300
I thought,
"How can this end for her?"

1241
01:11:39,345 --> 01:11:40,937
I don't think it had
a happy ending.

1242
01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:43,608
I was very glad that these men
that she took care of

1243
01:11:43,650 --> 01:11:44,878
when they were little kids

1244
01:11:44,918 --> 01:11:47,284
kind of came to her rescue.

1245
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:52,315
They got her an apartment
and paid for her rent.

1246
01:12:00,301 --> 01:12:02,166
Do you live in the area?

1247
01:12:02,202 --> 01:12:03,669
Yeah, I live in the area.

1248
01:12:03,704 --> 01:12:06,434
Do you remember a woman who
used to sit on this bench a lot,

1249
01:12:06,473 --> 01:12:07,599
wearing a big floppy hat?

1250
01:12:07,641 --> 01:12:10,007
Um, was she the French lady?

1251
01:12:10,044 --> 01:12:11,875
Yeah, I remember her.

1252
01:12:11,912 --> 01:12:15,370
People who still, um,
live around here,

1253
01:12:15,416 --> 01:12:17,316
yeah, we remember her.

1254
01:12:17,351 --> 01:12:21,378
She was here a lot,
sitting on the bench,

1255
01:12:21,422 --> 01:12:24,357
but I don't think
anybody really talked to her.

1256
01:12:24,391 --> 01:12:26,951
There's a lot of
eccentric people around here,

1257
01:12:26,994 --> 01:12:30,054
and I just thought
she was one of them.

1258
01:12:30,097 --> 01:12:32,622
You knew
to just leave her alone.

1259
01:12:34,835 --> 01:12:36,962
Sometimes she'd be
at the dumpsters.

1260
01:12:37,004 --> 01:12:40,235
You'd ask her, you know, "Do you
need help or do you need food?"

1261
01:12:40,274 --> 01:12:44,472
And she would just kind of
yell at you in French.

1262
01:12:44,511 --> 01:12:45,910
How did you know her?

1263
01:12:45,946 --> 01:12:47,345
Just from seeing her
in the neighborhood.

1264
01:12:47,381 --> 01:12:48,712
And you would sit with her?

1265
01:12:48,749 --> 01:12:49,807
Well, I'd always sit
on the bench,

1266
01:12:49,850 --> 01:12:51,215
and she'd sit there,

1267
01:12:51,251 --> 01:12:53,277
and finally
it took weeks or months

1268
01:12:53,321 --> 01:12:54,754
before she'd even speak to me.

1269
01:12:54,789 --> 01:12:56,347
I would see her in the alley
all the time,

1270
01:12:56,391 --> 01:12:57,619
going through the garbage,

1271
01:12:57,659 --> 01:12:59,957
so I had a bunch of old clothes
and a wool hat one time

1272
01:12:59,995 --> 01:13:01,155
I gave her, and she took it.

1273
01:13:01,196 --> 01:13:02,390
She said, "Oh, that's great."

1274
01:13:02,430 --> 01:13:04,728
I'll wear that when I sleep."

1275
01:13:04,766 --> 01:13:06,529
She was very short with people,

1276
01:13:06,568 --> 01:13:08,297
but she was funny, though.

1277
01:13:08,336 --> 01:13:09,928
Nice lady.

1278
01:13:09,971 --> 01:13:12,769
When I was riding my bike,
sometimes I'd cross her path,

1279
01:13:12,807 --> 01:13:16,334
and she'd yell to me,
"Get a bell! Get a bell!"

1280
01:13:16,378 --> 01:13:19,006
And sometimes I'd be out
in the alley in the winter

1281
01:13:19,047 --> 01:13:21,607
and she'd see me without a hat,

1282
01:13:21,649 --> 01:13:24,311
and she'd yell,
"Get a hat! Get a hat!"

1283
01:13:24,352 --> 01:13:26,343
She was about that bell
on the bike.

1284
01:13:26,388 --> 01:13:29,380
Who would have known that she
was actually a great artist

1285
01:13:29,424 --> 01:13:31,255
and she'd come
to dumpster-diving?

1286
01:13:31,292 --> 01:13:32,850
That's the saddest-

1287
01:13:32,894 --> 01:13:34,293
And, I mean,
sitting on the park bench-

1288
01:13:34,329 --> 01:13:35,660
literally,
she'd go across the street.

1289
01:13:35,697 --> 01:13:36,857
She'd get a can of food.

1290
01:13:36,898 --> 01:13:38,559
What did she have the one day?

1291
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:40,397
Was, like, corned beef hash
or something?

1292
01:13:40,435 --> 01:13:42,460
I mean, right out of the can,
not even warming it up,

1293
01:13:42,504 --> 01:13:43,869
with a spoon...

1294
01:13:43,905 --> 01:13:45,770
And said it was delicious.

1295
01:13:50,011 --> 01:13:54,176
She was much more damaged
than I thought,

1296
01:13:54,216 --> 01:13:57,208
and I have a lot more empathy
for her.

1297
01:13:57,253 --> 01:13:59,118
Um...

1298
01:14:03,626 --> 01:14:05,491
I just think, um...

1299
01:14:05,528 --> 01:14:09,328
what a lonely lady, you know?

1300
01:14:09,365 --> 01:14:11,925
Incredibly lonely

1301
01:14:11,967 --> 01:14:14,993
and misunderstood.

1302
01:14:16,739 --> 01:14:18,331
So, yeah, I think, I mean,

1303
01:14:18,374 --> 01:14:20,774
now if I were to see her today
after this,

1304
01:14:20,810 --> 01:14:23,711
I wouldn't be as hard on her,
probably.

1305
01:14:27,416 --> 01:14:30,647
Somebody called me and said
the old lady in the park,

1306
01:14:30,686 --> 01:14:32,745
she fell,
she kind of passed out,

1307
01:14:32,788 --> 01:14:34,483
and the ambulance is out there.

1308
01:14:34,523 --> 01:14:37,981
So I went across the street,
and at that point,

1309
01:14:38,027 --> 01:14:41,087
they were loading her
onto the little cart there,

1310
01:14:41,130 --> 01:14:44,099
and she was telling the people,
the paramedics and such,

1311
01:14:44,133 --> 01:14:45,623
that she did not want to go.

1312
01:14:45,668 --> 01:14:47,329
She wanted to go home.

1313
01:14:47,369 --> 01:14:49,360
And they said
that she has to go with,

1314
01:14:49,405 --> 01:14:52,465
and she looked at me as if
to say, "Can you do something?"

1315
01:14:52,508 --> 01:14:54,237
But there was nothing I could do
about it.

1316
01:14:54,276 --> 01:14:55,710
You know,
I asked the paramedics.

1317
01:14:55,745 --> 01:14:57,645
They said, "No, she has to go."

1318
01:15:01,084 --> 01:15:02,574
But that was it.

1319
01:15:02,619 --> 01:15:05,986
I mean, they put her in the
ambulance and took her away.

1320
01:15:06,022 --> 01:15:07,546
And then after the fact,
you know,

1321
01:15:07,591 --> 01:15:09,218
a lot of people
in the neighborhood said,

1322
01:15:09,259 --> 01:15:10,385
"Whatever happened
to the old lady?"

1323
01:15:10,427 --> 01:15:12,486
And nobody ever knew.

1324
01:15:37,387 --> 01:15:42,950
You have to try to draw
from the evidence you have

1325
01:15:42,993 --> 01:15:47,020
some understanding
of the individual.

1326
01:15:47,063 --> 01:15:51,022
I think her pictures
show a tenderness,

1327
01:15:51,067 --> 01:15:54,935
instant alertness
to human tragedies,

1328
01:15:54,971 --> 01:15:59,500
and those moments of generosity
and sweetness.

1329
01:15:59,544 --> 01:16:00,841
I see her

1330
01:16:00,878 --> 01:16:05,247
as an incredibly watchful,
observant, caring person.

1331
01:16:05,283 --> 01:16:08,719
And probably why she was a nanny

1332
01:16:08,753 --> 01:16:12,450
was that she had
those capacities.

1333
01:16:12,490 --> 01:16:17,951
1962, when she took
a lot of the pictures,

1334
01:16:17,995 --> 01:16:21,055
the kids would always play
in the ravines.

1335
01:16:21,098 --> 01:16:24,033
It's the most beautiful spot
in the world.

1336
01:16:27,305 --> 01:16:28,636
You know, instead of

1337
01:16:28,673 --> 01:16:31,039
this straight-edged
suburban community,

1338
01:16:31,075 --> 01:16:32,565
you always went there

1339
01:16:32,610 --> 01:16:34,669
'cause you wanted the kids to
have a little touch of nature.

1340
01:16:34,712 --> 01:16:38,204
You know, wild nature.

1341
01:16:38,249 --> 01:16:40,877
There were a patch
of wild strawberries

1342
01:16:40,918 --> 01:16:43,546
somewhere in there.

1343
01:16:45,923 --> 01:16:47,788
And I think she liked it
so much,

1344
01:16:47,825 --> 01:16:51,454
that's why they buried her
there.

1345
01:16:51,495 --> 01:16:55,829
It's a place that they
remembered she was happy.

1346
01:16:57,368 --> 01:17:00,361
Now, you tell me
how you can live forever.

1347
01:17:00,405 --> 01:17:02,600
- Uh...
- Come on.

1348
01:17:02,641 --> 01:17:06,008
She might have gotten to the
end of her life and thought,

1349
01:17:06,044 --> 01:17:11,107
"Why didn't I try
to get that work out there?"

1350
01:17:11,149 --> 01:17:14,243
Some people's character
prevents them

1351
01:17:14,286 --> 01:17:17,778
from pushing that little bit
you need to push

1352
01:17:17,823 --> 01:17:19,814
to get the work seen.

1353
01:17:19,858 --> 01:17:22,952
You know, she didn't
defend herself as an artist.

1354
01:17:22,995 --> 01:17:25,964
She just did the work.

1355
01:17:25,998 --> 01:17:29,729
A canon is often established,
and so when someone comes in,

1356
01:17:29,768 --> 01:17:32,931
there's always the sense
that they're secondary figures,

1357
01:17:32,971 --> 01:17:36,031
but I don't feel her
as secondary.

1358
01:17:36,074 --> 01:17:41,774
When I look at the pictures,
I always feel something primary.

1359
01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:47,844
I think that the work is so good

1360
01:17:47,886 --> 01:17:49,877
that it's really winning over
a lot of people

1361
01:17:49,921 --> 01:17:53,152
who were more dismissive of it
previously.

1362
01:17:53,191 --> 01:17:55,125
Where it'll wind up, who knows?

1363
01:17:56,461 --> 01:17:58,588
Much of the art world
establishment

1364
01:17:58,630 --> 01:18:00,997
still hasn't accepted
Vivian Maier's work.

1365
01:18:01,034 --> 01:18:03,002
But people don't care.

1366
01:18:03,036 --> 01:18:06,665
They're not waiting for that
validation from institutions.

1367
01:18:06,706 --> 01:18:10,005
They're claiming Vivian Maier's
work for themselves.

1368
01:18:11,678 --> 01:18:14,647
Her work is now in galleries
in New York.

1369
01:18:19,185 --> 01:18:22,211
It can be seen in L.A.

1370
01:18:27,493 --> 01:18:30,121
There's one in particular
that I bought which I love.

1371
01:18:30,163 --> 01:18:32,063
There's an abject poverty
in the frame,

1372
01:18:32,098 --> 01:18:34,931
but there's also a happiness
in spite of it all.

1373
01:18:36,703 --> 01:18:39,729
Her work is being seen
around the world.

1374
01:18:39,772 --> 01:18:43,503
London, Germany, Denmark.

1375
01:18:43,543 --> 01:18:47,741
They're embracing it, and
they're embracing Vivian Maier.

1376
01:18:54,487 --> 01:18:55,511
Oui, oui, oui.

1377
01:19:34,862 --> 01:19:36,955
Maybe this is the best way
of all for her,

1378
01:19:36,997 --> 01:19:39,989
to have it happen
after she's died.

1379
01:19:40,033 --> 01:19:42,058
That would probably make Viv
happiest,

1380
01:19:42,102 --> 01:19:44,195
'cause in her own life,
the attention, I think,

1381
01:19:44,238 --> 01:19:46,433
she would have found
overwhelming.

1382
01:19:48,742 --> 01:19:50,801
Viv was supposed to be
downtrodden, right?

1383
01:19:50,844 --> 01:19:52,709
She was, like, a nanny.

1384
01:19:52,746 --> 01:19:55,027
That's not considered to be
a pretty high-ranking position

1385
01:19:55,048 --> 01:19:56,538
in life.

1386
01:19:56,583 --> 01:20:02,351
Not married, not any social life
to speak of.

1387
01:20:02,389 --> 01:20:06,588
She didn't have
these measures of status

1388
01:20:06,628 --> 01:20:09,290
that people aspire to,

1389
01:20:09,330 --> 01:20:13,699
but she didn't have to
compromise one bit.

1390
01:20:13,735 --> 01:20:14,997
She did what she wanted.

1391
01:20:15,036 --> 01:20:17,061
That's what she taught me,

1392
01:20:17,105 --> 01:20:18,595
is that she got the life
she wanted.

1393
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:19,971
She had it.

1394
01:20:24,145 --> 01:20:28,206
I understand a lot more
about her.

1395
01:20:30,885 --> 01:20:37,051
But why was this person
so private,

1396
01:20:37,091 --> 01:20:42,552
yet so prolific in an art form
that she never shared?

1397
01:20:42,597 --> 01:20:44,497
Who knows?

1398
01:20:44,532 --> 01:20:47,433
She did it
so it wouldn't be forgotten,

1399
01:20:47,469 --> 01:20:50,097
and here it's not forgotten.

1400
01:20:51,606 --> 01:20:53,130
As she was photographing,

1401
01:20:53,174 --> 01:20:56,109
she was seeing just how close
you can come

1402
01:20:56,144 --> 01:21:00,478
into somebody's space
and make a picture of them.

1403
01:21:00,515 --> 01:21:02,244
That tells me a lot about her.

1404
01:21:02,283 --> 01:21:04,274
It tells me that she could go
into a space

1405
01:21:04,319 --> 01:21:05,912
with a total stranger

1406
01:21:05,955 --> 01:21:09,584
and get them to accommodate her
by being themselves

1407
01:21:09,625 --> 01:21:14,585
and generate
this kind of moment, you know,

1408
01:21:14,630 --> 01:21:17,292
where two presences
were actually

1409
01:21:17,333 --> 01:21:20,063
kind of vibrating together.

1410
01:21:24,406 --> 01:21:25,930
And then she's gone.

1411
01:21:34,683 --> 01:21:37,379
Well, I suppose nothing
is meant to last forever.

1412
01:21:37,419 --> 01:21:38,943
We have to make room
for other people.

1413
01:21:38,988 --> 01:21:40,387
It's a wheel.

1414
01:21:40,422 --> 01:21:42,219
You get on,
you have to go to the end,

1415
01:21:42,258 --> 01:21:44,453
and then somebody else
takes their place.

1416
01:21:44,493 --> 01:21:46,017
Now I'm going to close

1417
01:21:46,061 --> 01:21:48,894
and quickly run next door
to do my work.
