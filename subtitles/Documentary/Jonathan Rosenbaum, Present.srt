1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,450
'Who in the world are you?'

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,330
'I am the greatest
magician of the age.'

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,410
He murdered her. Dig up his bones.
Let him be punished for...

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,690
'The magician of Hanover Square!'

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,500
Mr Norrell!

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,010
I am come, Sir Walter, to offer you
my help in our present difficulties.

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,250
~ You mean the war?
~ Yes.

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,330
'There's a wonderful street
magician, Vinculus.

9
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,770
'He's all lies and doom.'

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,570
I met a man under a hedge who
told me I was a magician.

11
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,250
Then buy these two
spells from me, sir.

12
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,370
"One spell to discover what mine
enemy is doing presently."

13
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,360
'Why on earth would
you want to do that?'

14
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,130
'These are horrible, Jonathan.'

15
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,210
'Sir Walter's bride is dead.'

16
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,050
£1,000 a year and quite dead.

17
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,290
It is a very dangerous thing to
bring someone back from the dead.

18
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,130
'It has not been done in 300 years.'

19
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,450
Aaargh!

20
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,770
'Should I agree to restore this
beautiful young woman to life,

21
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,530
'what would be my reward?'

22
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,810
Miss Wintertowne!

23
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,690
~ My Lord.
~ 'A miracle. The magician of Hanover Square

24
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:09,660
'has restored the young lady
to life and to dance.'

25
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,500
L'ennemi arrive! Aux armes!

26
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,500
Allons-y!

27
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,410
Well done! The hero of the blockade!

28
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,860
You, sir, are a hero!

29
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,780
You showed those Frenchies!

30
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,530
Is that Gilby?

31
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,180
Hello, there!

32
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,530
Gilby!

33
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,250
No, they cannot hear you, my Lord.

34
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,970
Can we see what Wellington is up to?

35
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,420
Good God!

36
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,610
Of course, the most useful
thing would be to have a

37
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,530
magician on the spot.

38
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,650
The Peninsula. Mr Norrell?

39
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,690
I-I am a poor traveller.

40
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,170
What about Nelson, for
another resurrection, sir?

41
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,490
Bring him back to life.

42
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,530
He was always the Navy's
man. Surely, Mr Pitt...

43
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,490
~ Lord Marlborough!
~ Sir Walter Raleigh!
~ I'd say Clive of India.

44
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,090
No, no, g-gentlemen, this magic
is extremely dangerous.

45
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,690
Consider the condition of Mr Pitt's
body and indeed, Lord Nelson's.

46
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:22,050
Ah, yes. I suppose they must have
both come a deal unravelled by now.

47
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,890
But I can furnish more
blockades, gentlemen...

48
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,170
All manner of weather spells.

49
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,850
.. and, and, and I-I have in
mind a line of sea beacons,

50
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:36,050
magical defences to ensure that these
islands can never be invaded again.

51
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,210
However...

52
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,930
it is my belief that we should
do all in our power,

53
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:49,050
even in a time of war, to ensure that
English magic is... respectable.

54
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,570
Er, indeed?

55
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,570
Assistance from the Government
in putting down disreputable,

56
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,290
old-fashioned magic,

57
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,770
the banishment of street magicians
and the like, would help me

58
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,420
wonderfully for the matter in hand.

59
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,850
Do the business you have
offered, Mr Norrell.

60
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,570
My Government will assist
you in any way you wish.

61
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,620
We shall be the closest
of companions, sir.

62
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,650
Starecross Hall, formerly the
shadow house of Miss Absalom.

63
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,740
I think this will suit our
purpose nicely, don't you?

64
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,170
In strict accordance
with our contract,

65
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,820
we should not be doing this at all.

66
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,080
I did not sign that contract.

67
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,890
What an awful lot of work.

68
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:50,690
Yes, but there is so much history
here to inspire the pupils.

69
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,090
Mr Honeyfoot.

70
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,930
To think this house was built
with stones from the castle

71
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,130
of the Raven King himself.

72
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,650
Up there will make a splendid
refectory for the boys.

73
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,660
I think there is... someone
performing... magic...

74
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,930
~ What in hell do you think you're doing here?
~ 'John.'

75
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,170
John!

76
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,730
Mr Segundus! Mr Segundus!

77
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,650
~ I said, what in hell do
you think you're doing here?
~ Jonathan!

78
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,850
~ You, you with the twice-turned sleeves.
~ Jonathan!

79
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,050
Sir, I would beg you to speak to
this gentleman with more respect.

80
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,930
We're here to view this
house. It is for sale.

81
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,890
~ You were in my dream.
~ The dream, sir, was mine.

82
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,970
I lay down here on purpose to dream
it. I'm rather of the opinion that

83
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,970
in England, a gentleman's dreams
are his own private concern.

84
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,770
Jonathan, calm down. You'll
give yourself a nosebleed.

85
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,130
It cannot be the same dream.

86
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,850
Arabella, I no longer
have nosebleeds.

87
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,930
I have not had a nosebleed
since I was 17.

88
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,690
Of course it was the same dream.

89
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,930
A lady in a blue gown
with stars on it?

90
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,690
Miss Absalom, the enchantress?

91
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,010
Yes, Miss Absalom the ench...
Of course Miss Absalom

92
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,930
the enchantress! This was Miss
Absalom the enchantress' house!

93
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,570
Now, really, this is most
frustrating. I'd finally managed to

94
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,810
summon her, and I cannot
now remember how I did it.

95
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,490
How can I call myself a magician
if I cannot control the magic I do?

96
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,730
You summoned her, sir?

97
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:54,580
Yes, and you, you
frightened her away.

98
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,850
~ What?
~ But... nothing like that has
been done in England for...

99
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,970
300 years.

100
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,690
Oh, well.

101
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,890
I-I got the idea by reading
about Paris Ormskirk, you see.

102
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,330
Ormskirk's spells never worked.

103
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,010
Well, they never worked for anyone.

104
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,860
Not even Ormskirk!

105
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,100
Are you magicians?

106
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,330
We were both members of the
York Society, sir, madam.

107
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:24,290
Our brotherhood was alas
closed by Mr Norrell.

108
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:28,490
Oh, him. The patron saint
of English booksellers.

109
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,250
"Ah, sir, you've come too late.

110
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,490
"I did have a great many
magical books at one time,

111
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,570
"but, alas, I sold them all to
a learned man of Yorkshire."

112
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:39,410
You mean to say you have
done all this without books?

113
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,200
In a few months?

114
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,760
Well, I... I do have one book.

115
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,340
My wife gave it to me.

116
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,730
Your husband is a marvel, madam.

117
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,250
Oh, I know nothing of magic.

118
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,580
Do take an egg before
he eats them all.

119
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:07,050
So, tell me, what brings
you two to Starecross?

120
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,610
Mr Segundus has it in mind to
establish a school for magicians.

121
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,210
Oh.

122
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,730
Could do with a school of magic.

123
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,170
I-I cannot make it
do as I wish, you see.

124
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,730
'Tis a continuous leak, an accident.

125
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,170
~ Then you should apply to Mr Norrell, sir.
~ Huh.

126
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,130
No, no. In the Raven
King's times, sir,

127
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,970
his times, when there
were no books of magic,

128
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,650
a young fellow with a talent would
knock on the door of an older

129
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,770
~ magician, and ask to be apprenticed.
~ Gentlemen, you of all people should

130
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,890
know that Gilbert Norrell does not
look favourably on other magicians.

131
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,290
Not theoretical magicians,
to be sure, sir.

132
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,890
Have you read his periodical,
The Friends Of English Magic?

133
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:47,730
Huh, it's about the most ironical
title for anything I ever heard of.

134
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,320
But you are his equal, Mr Strange.

135
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,580
You are his equal.

136
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,050
Well?

137
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,640
"Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell."

138
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,370
It sounds very well.

139
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,130
We shall write to him
on your behalf, sir.

140
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,770
Look at what one magician
has been able to accomplish.

141
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,290
Only consider what two might do.

142
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:15,960
'He was no more a magician than
I'm the Duchess of Devonshire.'

143
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:19,210
In every provincial newspaper,
there's two or three reports.

144
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,010
I read in the Bath Chronicle, there
was a man called Gibbons who

145
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,690
turned two housebreakers into mice.

146
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:27,210
Believe me, my Lady, there
was no magic. We examined it.

147
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,490
It was mice all along.

148
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,010
All these stories prove
false in the end.

149
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,690
There is no magic but Mr Norrell's.

150
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,970
There is no-one, my Lady.

151
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:39,650
In order to perform his
extraordinary deeds,

152
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:45,450
Mr Norrell shut himself away for
years and years, reading books!

153
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,130
Because I think you must
be a little lonely.

154
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,450
Oh, one is never lonely
when one has a book.

155
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,250
Agh!

156
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,850
(Oh, beg your pardon, sir.)

157
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,010
Oh, I'm so sorry, Mr Norrell.

158
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,130
Stephen, would you mind?

159
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,170
(Sorry.)

160
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,890
Allow me, sir.

161
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,930
I'm most humbly sorry, sir.

162
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,770
Lady Pole's servants have arrived
with her from Hampshire.

163
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,570
They are...

164
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,290
country people.

165
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,330
I've not had the training of them.

166
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,810
"Country people"?

167
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:30,530
They bring with them the
most absurd superstitions.

168
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,850
I do not know why.

169
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,010
They have it in their heads
that the house is haunted.

170
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:38,290
Bells where there are no
bells and such the like.

171
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,860
It is really very inconvenient to
the proper running of the household.

172
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,770
There.

173
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:55,930
The only thing he was able
to make disappear was claret.

174
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,170
~ What is it?
~ We should go dancing.

175
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,490
Yes, of course we should,
dear, but perhaps later.

176
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,090
No, I should like to dance now! Come.

177
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,410
I'm being asked to dance,
I cannot refuse my wife.

178
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:08,090
Um, Lord Liverpool, will
you join us, please?

179
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,730
Dancing, everybody.

180
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,980
So, slow down. I'm coming.

181
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,450
'Grant me half her life.

182
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,620
'Half a life is better than none.'

183
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,610
Good morning, my dear.

184
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,260
Good morning.

185
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,560
Shall I fetch your glove?

186
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:15,450
Are you well, Emma?

187
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,970
Yes, Sir Walter. Quite well.

188
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:29,570
Forgive me, I must be at the house. There
is a dance tonight at Lady Godesdone's?

189
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,290
I'm tired of dancing. I'm sick of it.

190
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,610
I do not wish to dance any more.

191
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,850
My dear.

192
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,420
Mr Norrell.

193
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:08,210
S-S-S-Sir Walter tells me you
have not quite been yourself.

194
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,380
Yes. Um....

195
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,650
Well, so, you see...

196
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,500
it began two or three
nights ago. I...

197
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:22,340
There was once a Christian
named Julius Caesar, who...

198
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:29,570
Forgive me, um... who...
who landed in England

199
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,180
and was met by three gentlemen,
all named John Hollyshoes.

200
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,140
Sir, forgive me...

201
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,530
Forgive me, that was
not what I meant to say.

202
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,170
Please, say what you wish.

203
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:45,720
~ Would you like a glass of water, my dear?
~ No, um...

204
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:53,330
The master of the castle of Pity-Me
had a magical ring that was stolen

205
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:57,900
by his daughter and eaten by a Christian
goose at St Matthew's feast.

206
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,640
Forgive me.

207
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,620
Mr Norrell... Walter...

208
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,780
.. please, please.

209
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,930
As much as it pains
me to say it, sir,

210
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,900
I do not believe that whatever has distressed
her ladyship is within my power to remedy.

211
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,690
But the doctor's found
nothing. Not even a cold.

212
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,290
Is it not part of the magic?

213
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:30,770
Whatever ailment her ladyship has
seems to me to be more spiritual

214
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:34,090
than physical and so belongs
to neither magic nor medicine.

215
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,080
What is her ailment?

216
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,100
I'm sorry. I can do
nothing for Lady Pole.

217
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,580
Magic cannot cure madness.

218
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,970
What do you mean by
summoning me here?

219
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,490
What have you done to Lady Pole?

220
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:25,490
I am bringing my lady to a ball.
A gentleman must prepare.

221
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,410
I summoned you because
you cheated me.

222
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:31,050
I have kept to the terms
of our agreement.

223
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,210
~ Half her life.
~ Yes.

224
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,050
But I thought she would just
live to 40 and then seem to die.

225
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,840
I never said so.

226
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:44,490
I have done what you asked and
now I may come and go as I please.

227
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:47,530
If you were truly concerned
for Lady Pole's happiness...

228
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,730
I do not care about her happiness, I
care about the success of English magic.

229
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,570
Her husband is my champion and
you are bringing him very low.

230
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:57,780
It is entirely mysterious to me why
you prefer the help of this person...

231
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,250
~ .. to mine.
~ What if he were to mistrust me?

232
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,380
Then I shall raise him up,
to some lofty position.

233
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,170
He shall be Prime Minister.

234
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,170
Or Emperor of Great Britain, perhaps?

235
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,330
No, I merely want him
to be pleased with me.

236
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,650
Her husband will never know.

237
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:19,580
No-one will ever know where
she is when she sleeps.

238
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,170
Half her life...

239
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,770
that was our bargain.

240
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,530
I wish for you to return
to your lands.

241
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,690
I wish for you to go there
and never come back.

242
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:33,370
And I was going there when
you summoned me so rudely

243
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:36,210
and in such ignorance
of the proper customs

244
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:39,660
and forms of magical etiquette.

245
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:45,490
I could teach you these proper forms.

246
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,740
I can teach you to
raise up mountains...

247
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,490
.. crush your enemies beneath them.

248
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:02,530
Yes, and you can shackle
English magic to your whims.

249
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,010
You can steal English men
and women from their homes

250
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:08,050
and you can trap them in a
world of your degenerate race.

251
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,770
Well, I forbid it, sir. I forbid it.

252
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:42,250
A person may call and
call in this house

253
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,620
and yet no-one comes.

254
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:49,580
There is to be a ball,
tonight, at Lost-Hope...

255
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,930
.. and look at me.

256
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:03,460
How can I meet my lady like this?

257
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,620
I'm sorry, sir.

258
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,840
Nobody told me you were here.

259
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:42,260
I must say, my own ignorant fellow
has not half your skill.

260
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,170
This is exactly the sort
of task I like, sir.

261
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,690
How splendid we look.

262
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:52,090
But I have taken you for
a servant in this house.

263
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,280
That is quite impossible.

264
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:59,250
As your reward, Stephen...

265
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,730
as my gift...

266
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:05,100
I invite you to join
us at our ball tonight.

267
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,380
Do you accept?

268
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:12,490
Thank you, sir.

269
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,500
The bargain is done.

270
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,250
Will you pass me my little box?

271
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,420
It is a token I wish my lady to wear.

272
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:39,980
I invite you to our ball, tonight.

273
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,740
The bargain is done.

274
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,810
Mr Black?

275
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,700
Mr Black?

276
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,860
I am so troubled by this bell, sir.

277
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:12,170
It calls to mind everyone I
have ever known who's died.

278
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,610
Geoffrey.

279
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:17,810
I have accepted a position at
the Duchess of Devonshire's.

280
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,130
Are you all right, Mr Black?

281
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,610
I ache.

282
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:25,660
As does a man who's been
dancing all night.

283
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:31,210
Well, I wish you the
best of happiness of it.

284
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,890
Alfred...

285
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:38,010
it is your task at this time to lay out
the silver for Mrs Brandy to polish.

286
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:41,050
Alfred is going back
to Hampshire, sir.

287
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,700
To look after his uncle's chickens.

288
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:05,720
This looks like a
magician's house to me.

289
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,620
Do you remember my mother?

290
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,570
Just.

291
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:27,920
She used to bring me to
London when I was small.

292
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,280
An escape from Father, I suppose.

293
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:36,440
I'm sure my husband will
be kinder than hers.

294
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,960
He will do his best.

295
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,620
Come. Let's see that you're ready.

296
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,930
Never met a magician before.

297
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,900
Not a real one.

298
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:56,410
A gentlemen's magazine is an
odd place to write about magic.

299
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:01,130
Mr Murray's Friends of English Magic
is the only reputable periodical.

300
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:03,980
It's personally approved
by Mr Norrell.

301
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:08,170
~ Yes, I-I-I have read it.
~ Mr Lascelles is the editor.

302
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:12,210
Perhaps it was reading the Friends that
made you decide to become a magician?

303
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,810
No.

304
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:17,250
No, to own the truth, sir, I'd
not even heard of Mr Norrell.

305
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,370
~ I-I met a strange man under a hedge.
~ Well, this is all most entertaining

306
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:24,090
~ and strange, but the fact of the
matter is, that it really won't do.
~ Oh?

307
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:28,330
Mr Norrell is the only
magician in England, sir.

308
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,050
That is a fact.

309
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,730
It's understandable for an idle chap to want
to amuse himself in this fashionable way.

310
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:37,210
I should be very glad to see
some of Mr Strange's magic now.

311
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,090
~ Mr Norrell...
~ If he would favour us.

312
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:44,100
~ Mr Norrell, please.
~ Let the man do his trick, sir.

313
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:49,340
Nothing would give
me greater pleasure.

314
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,400
This is one of my own spells.

315
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:35,130
Oh, Mr Strange.

316
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:39,130
Oh, my dear Mr Strange,
this is remarkable.

317
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,490
I have never even
heard of such magic.

318
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,810
This is not recorded,
sir. This is not in S...

319
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,810
This is not in Sutton-Grove.

320
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,530
Is it a different colour?

321
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,180
Pick it up. Pick it up, pick it up.

322
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,720
It is backward, it...

323
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:00,140
That is the reflection.

324
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:05,130
The real one is in the mirror.

325
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:08,730
I apologise, sir, I do not
know how to bring it back.

326
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:12,210
To own the truth, I have only the
haziest notion of what I did.

327
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:16,410
Well, how did you do it, if you
did not know how you did it?

328
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:19,770
It's like music playing
at the back of one's head.

329
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,810
You understand what
I mean, Mr Norrell?

330
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:24,890
Hearing it for the very first
time and yet one, somehow,

331
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:28,930
simply knows what the
following note will be.

332
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,900
Yes. Yes, I do understand
what you mean.

333
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,610
I have taken the liberty
of drawing up

334
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:41,770
a plan of study for
the next ten years.

335
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:44,290
It is such a very short
time, Mr Strange.

336
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:47,340
I cannot see that we
will achieve very much.

337
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,220
Er...

338
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,290
Ten years.

339
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,050
There is rather more to learn
than I had supposed, sir.

340
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,290
The practice of magic
is full of frustrations

341
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,700
and disappointment, but the
study is a continual delight.

342
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,530
Where do you begin?

343
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,050
Here we are.

344
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,770
Ah, yes, I see.

345
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,890
Ah, how many centuries
is it do you think

346
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:19,530
since two English magicians
last sat down together?

347
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:22,610
I'm not so very clever on magicians.

348
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,690
I only really know the Raven King.

349
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:28,810
Yes, well, we must have
respectable magic, above all.

350
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,690
Let us make that our first task.

351
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:34,050
The magio-historian, Valentine Munday,
has many failings but he is

352
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:37,810
very strong on the Magicians of the
Golden Age, the so-called aureates.

353
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,250
I am sure we will get from him

354
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,970
the last time an English
magician took an apprentice.

355
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:45,460
I have his book here.

356
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,050
You wish me to read this book, sir?

357
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,970
Yes, indeed.

358
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,850
Then you must give it to me.

359
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,010
Yes.

360
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:58,580
And Chester's Language of Birds.

361
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:04,130
My favourite book. Here we are.

362
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,900
What is that? Most peculiar sound.

363
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,580
I think Mr Norrell is laughing.

364
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:19,100
We shall have to do something
about this "friendship".

365
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,850
I was wondering when we will
come to the magic of fairies?

366
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,810
I mean to say that,
well, for example,

367
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:35,690
Lanchester here quotes a book
by Ralph Stokesy detailing

368
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,690
the spells by which he found
his fairy servant, Col Tom Blue.

369
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,690
Well, I, I, I, I don't know that.

370
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,730
I do not have that book.

371
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,450
On the contrary, sir, you've made
a note of the shelf reference.

372
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,340
No, I do not have that book.

373
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:53,420
Er, um, yes... Perhaps,
perhaps I'm wrong.

374
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:08,090
Stephen! Stop them,
Stephen! Stop them.

375
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,500
Argh!

376
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,810
My lady. My lady, be calm.

377
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,570
~ What is it?
~ Be calm.

378
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,610
My dear? What might I do?

379
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:20,970
These bells. These
bells. They summon me.

380
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:24,970
~ They call me to the dance and
I must go through the mirrors.
~ Bells?

381
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:28,410
St George's. They struck seven
and it sent her to this.

382
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:32,050
~ Perhaps you have tired yourself. Stephen.
~ No!
~ Please.
~ No!

383
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,810
~ Yes.
~ No, I must not go to sleep.
~ Come on.

384
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,980
No! No! No! No!

385
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:45,260
Stephen, my dear fellow.
How noble you look.

386
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:53,820
Seeing you so, I know you are
truly destined to be a king.

387
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:03,340
The nameless slave shall
be a king in a strange land.

388
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:08,770
I have... I have certainly
dreamt of you.

389
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:15,130
Lost Hope is no dream. It is
the finest of my mansions.

390
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:18,290
You are merely under an
enchantment that brings you

391
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,680
each night to join our revels.

392
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:29,850
We have been dancing there
for days and days and days.

393
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:30,930
Forgive me, sir.

394
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:33,210
If you were to find it in
your heart to release...

395
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:38,140
No. That is impossible,
the bargain was made.

396
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:44,860
I do not know what I've done
to deserve such kindness, sir.

397
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:49,890
I'm sure I've not done
anything at all.

398
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:52,250
Sir?

399
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:56,210
Yours are the most excellent
manners, Stephen.

400
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,460
Sir.

401
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,580
Lady Pole?

402
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,250
Lady Pole!

403
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,410
Lady Pole!

404
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,050
Lady Pole!

405
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,490
Lady Pole!

406
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:27,210
I do find it queer that he
is so against the Raven King

407
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,650
and the whole notion of fairies.

408
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,450
The Duke of Roxburghe has died.

409
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,650
It says here that he has a lot
of debts and a very large library.

410
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,610
I mean to say we are not
to touch upon it at all.

411
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,170
It seems to me the key to everything.

412
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:41,730
I need to find out more about that.
You need your own books, Jonathan.

413
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,730
There's a myth that the
Raven King wrote a book.

414
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,330
We ought to visit your aunt.

415
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:48,050
~ We should thank her for finding Mary for us.
~ Who?

416
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,450
New maid.

417
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,050
Do we have a new maid?

418
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,410
You're greatly changed by
your occupation, Jonathan.

419
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:56,130
I'm sure a month ago you would
have certainly noticed a new maid.

420
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,890
It's like attending
a priest's seminary

421
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:00,250
and being taught nothing about God.

422
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,970
In fact, being given the distinct
impression that God is wholly

423
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,890
irrelevant.

424
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:08,370
What do you mean I would certainly
have noticed a new maid?

425
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,010
Sir Walter Pole, sir.

426
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,930
Excuse the interruption, Mr Strange.

427
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:14,050
Madam. Er, we have a problem
with our blockade.

428
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,090
Three French destroyers
have slipped through.

429
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,370
We do not know where they are.

430
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,010
Er, I believe Mr Norrell has gone...

431
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:21,010
We do not have the time
to find Mr Norrell, sir.

432
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:24,220
Our boats must catch the tide.
You will do, will you not?

433
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,940
Um...

434
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,770
Come in.

435
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:34,450
~ Dratted watch must be fast.
~ Sorry?

436
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,970
Midday, no bells.

437
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:39,930
~ Uh, the bells in this
neighbourhood are no longer rung.
~ Why ever not?

438
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:43,130
My wife's illness has left
her nerves in a sad condition.

439
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:46,010
The tolling of a bell is
very distressing to her.

440
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,970
I shall not detain your husband
long, madam. Perhaps a tea?

441
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,450
~ Seed cake?
~ Oh, Arabella does not
care for seed cake, it is

442
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,650
a thing that she
particularly dislikes.

443
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:57,100
Arabella is not a
three-year-old, Jonathan. Go.

444
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,090
The locating of objects

445
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:05,130
is a particularly imprecise form of
magic, that I have not yet mastered.

446
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,850
Indeed. Well, I'm sure
you'll do your best.

447
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:11,660
Mr Norrell seems particularly
disinclined. Er, through here.

448
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,810
Oh, I beg your pardon.

449
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,980
Don't think of going. It is
so rare that I see anyone.

450
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:43,570
So many mournful little boats
and buildings and skies,

451
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,130
they seem to lose the people.

452
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,690
Venice is a labyrinth.

453
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:50,530
A vast and beautiful labyrinth, to
be sure, but a labyrinth no less.

454
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,450
I would give anything to go there.

455
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,770
If you had spent eternity, as
I have done, wearily parading up

456
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:59,900
and down dark alleyways,
you would feel differently.

457
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,840
I'm Arabella Strange.

458
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,770
My husband has the, erm,

459
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:09,050
~ honour of being Mr Norrell's
assistant and pupil.
~ Norrell?

460
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:12,450
Mm. We've heard much of the
great friendship that he's

461
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,570
extended to you.

462
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,820
Norrell is no friend to me.

463
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:20,530
I would be better dead than as I am.

464
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:33,250
Looks to me as though they have
headed for the West Indies.

465
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,730
And there I think Captain McBrien has

466
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:39,250
gone in search of them,
if that would make sense?

467
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,010
I should take this to Mr Norrell.

468
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,400
Does he ever speak of my wife?

469
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,170
I...

470
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:52,010
No, sir. He is a very modest man.

471
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:54,690
He will not speak of
her to me neither.

472
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,810
It is a closed subject.

473
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:02,010
Tell me, does your husband perform
magic by himself or only

474
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,330
under Norrell's eye?

475
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,490
Well, if there's anything

476
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:07,250
that your Ladyship would like me
to ask Mr Strange on your behalf,

477
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,970
if there's any service
that he can do...

478
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:12,290
What I have to tell you is more
for your husband's sake than mine.

479
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,140
I fear I am lost.

480
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:18,540
Mr Strange should know what kind
of a man he is dealing with.

481
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,220
What was done to Lady Pole?

482
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,800
How was it done?

483
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:28,810
There are many books that I
am not yet permitted to read.

484
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:31,860
Is there any way in which
it may be undone?

485
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,500
Undone?

486
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:38,640
I fear neither of us
can bear it much longer.

487
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:45,170
I will enquire. I cannot
promise an answer, sir.

488
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,700
Thank you.

489
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:53,010
I should warn you, I have
made many attempts to tell

490
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:56,300
people of what has been done
and I have not yet succeeded.

491
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:04,970
In 1607, there was a silversmith
named Redshaw who lived in the

492
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:08,170
Kingdom of Halifax, West Yorkshire,
who inherited a Turkish rug.

493
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,690
He woke to find the carpet covered
in legions of tiny people,

494
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,290
about two inches high.

495
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:20,100
They rode white polecats and were
battling with knives and forks.

496
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,410
I'm sorry, that is not
what I meant to say.

497
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:28,370
Madam, may I implore you deeply
to say nothing of what you've

498
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,010
heard here today?

499
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:36,210
When anyone new comes to the house,
Lady Pole is excited to these...

500
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,620
outlandish speeches.

501
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:42,770
It is of great distress to
Sir Walter that anyone should

502
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:45,020
know of this private grief.

503
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:55,760
I hope they will let you
come again, Mrs Strange.

504
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,300
I see no-one.

505
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:04,450
Or rather I see roomfuls of people
and not a Christian amongst them.

506
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,210
Except for Stephen, of course.

507
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,890
I'm sorry, my Lady.

508
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:12,060
It's hardly your fault. Goodbye.

509
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,810
I do not understand why Sir
Walter would have come to you,

510
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:21,370
Mr Strange, when it was only
the matter of an hour or two.

511
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,090
There was some urgency
about the tides.

512
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:25,210
It really was an ill-mannered
thing, especially

513
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:28,730
since I was engaged in attempting to
establish his wretched sea beacons.

514
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:32,020
And of little use since you can
hardly have found the ships.

515
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,930
You did not find the ships, did you?

516
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:43,090
They wish this in an
impossibly short time.

517
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,970
1,000 miles of coast are surround...

518
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:47,250
Er, er, it will take years.

519
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:51,450
Do you wish me to assist you,
sir? Where do you begin?

520
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,330
Portsmouth, naturally.

521
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,250
And you're using Belasis?

522
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:58,940
I'm adding Pevensey's spells
of Ward and Watch. There.

523
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:02,370
May I ask a question?

524
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,650
I mean to say, Sir Walter
is primarily concerned that

525
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,050
I should put a bell on them.

526
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,930
A bell! I ask you!

527
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:12,170
I'm so sorry. What was your question?

528
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:16,090
Well, I read more and
more of the Raven King.

529
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,890
Is not fairy magic useful?

530
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,730
It's usefulness is much exaggerated

531
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,610
and the dangers are
much under-estimated.

532
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,970
~ But what are the dangers?
~ Mr Strange, please believe me

533
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,970
when I say that almost
all forms of respectable

534
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:28,810
magic are perfectly achievable
without the assistance of anyone.

535
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:31,010
What have I ever done that
needed the help of a fairy?

536
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,730
I do not know.

537
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,610
The question was rhetorical.

538
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:38,210
But does not all English magic
come from the Raven King?

539
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,850
Who was stolen away to a fairy
court and who was raised

540
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,210
and learnt his magic...

541
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:46,090
The Raven King rode out of
these lands 300 years ago.

542
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:50,250
Abandoning us, and
abandoning English magic.

543
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,530
If we cannot make his name

544
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:54,130
and the name of his fairy
servants utterly forgotten,

545
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:57,930
then it is our duty, yours and mine,
to broadcast our hatred of him.

546
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:00,730
To let it be known everywhere our
abhorrence of his corrupt nature

547
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,780
and his evil deeds.

548
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:07,330
Forgive me, Mr Strange, I
have a, I have a headache,

549
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:08,970
I have a terrible headache.

550
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,960
Yes, yes, of course.

551
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,330
Gentlemen.

552
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,260
You should read this.

553
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:36,700
~ The Duke of Roxburghe...
~ Is dead.

554
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:43,860
~ Should we, um...
~ No, no. Let us wait.

555
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,300
Oh, well.

556
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:28,650
Ah, there you are.

557
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:32,610
I hope you do not mind me
bringing you here, Stephen.

558
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:35,970
Oh, do not concern
yourself about him.

559
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:40,290
He can neither see nor hear us.

560
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:46,570
He attempts to summon me, but I
do not allow myself to be seen.

561
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:52,010
Look, he is just as stupid
as the other one.

562
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,690
The other one?

563
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:56,690
And very nearly as ugly.

564
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:57,980
What?

565
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:07,660
Bell? Bell!

566
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:11,020
~ Yes, darling?
~ Sh, sh.

567
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:14,960
Can you hear voices next door?

568
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:19,970
I could swear I heard one person
call the other stupid and ugly.

569
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:23,180
Really? I think two old
ladies live on that side.

570
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:29,620
Well, we should be going soon.
Norrell is not likely to be late.

571
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:36,930
Jonathan, do you remember the
first spell that you cast?

572
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:40,010
The spell to find out what
my enemy is doing presently?

573
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:43,450
~ That was only the name of the spell
on the little scrap of paper.
~ Sir?

574
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:47,180
Do you remember who you were
shown? Who your enemy was?

575
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:52,450
How could Mr Norrell be my enemy?

576
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,290
Come, dear, we must be ready
to leave for Portsmouth.

577
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:57,650
What a strikingly attractive woman.

578
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:58,940
Sir.

579
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:16,570
The Government's situation
is, I'm afraid, madam,

580
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:19,490
about as bad as it could possibly be.

581
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:21,730
The French are
everywhere, triumphant.

582
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:24,650
Our allies have discovered their
mistake and become our enemies.

583
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,290
Trade is ruined by the war.

584
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:28,250
The harvest has failed
for two straight years

585
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,370
and the King has gone mad again.

586
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:34,530
Everywhere things are going to ruin.
Apart, of course, from magic.

587
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:37,250
Magic has become a booming industry.

588
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:58,690
It is done. The sea defences
are now in place.

589
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:00,490
I cannot see anything.

590
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:04,170
You will not see anything.
They are invisible.

591
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:07,420
But they are there.

592
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,130
It is done.

593
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:13,770
Huzzah to Mr Norrell. Hip hip...

594
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:15,930
~ Huzzah!
~ Huzzah.

595
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:19,330
Huzzah to baffling the
French Navy! Hip, hip.

596
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,810
~ Excuse me.
~ Huzzah!

597
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:23,860
Well, congratulations.

598
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:28,130
You must be exhausted,
an extraordinary feat.

599
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:29,970
What about these beacons, sir?

600
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:32,490
Why did he not put a bell on them?

601
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,880
Will they work, do you think?

602
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:38,930
If Mr Norrell says they work, then...

603
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:41,920
You really think it
will repel the French?

604
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:45,940
I believe Strange and Sir Walter
accord very well together.

605
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,610
They are men of a
similar temperament.

606
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,570
How are you finding Portsmouth, sir?

607
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:55,020
I dislike Portsmouth intensely.

608
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:06,780
Jonathan.

609
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:12,740
Jonathan.

610
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:18,410
Beg pardon, sir.

611
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,810
The Port Admiral has sent to
say that a packet ship has run

612
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:23,330
~ aground upon Horse Sand.
~ Right.

613
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:26,330
The other magician has a
headache and will not come.

614
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:30,690
~ Right, well tell the Port,
whatever he's called...
~ Admiral.

615
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:33,080
Tell him to wait, I'm coming.

616
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:46,610
Don't dozens of ships go in
and out of here every day?

617
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:49,780
~ How did this happen?
~ Presumably, the invisible beacon.

618
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:56,130
So, the boat's on her side.
Um, shall I just turn her up?

619
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:59,130
Good God, no. You'll split the
keel in two. They'll all drown.

620
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:02,810
A fresher breeze will
move her at high water.

621
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:04,970
Well, I can make a fresher
breeze. We've done that.

622
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:06,730
No, good God, what are you thinking?

623
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:09,370
It's coming sou'west, you'll
batter her on the sands.

624
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:10,930
They'll all drown.

625
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:14,050
~ What is the sand called?
~ The sand?

626
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:19,530
The thing... What the ship is standing
on, the Horse's something.

627
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:22,940
It is a shoal and it is called
Horse Sand. Excuse me.

628
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:35,100
Good.

629
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:43,330
What the hell are they?

630
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:48,220
They're called horses. I
made them out of Horse Sand.

631
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:52,010
Hot rolls and marmalade, anyone?

632
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:54,860
Morning, sir. Gentlemen.

633
00:49:57,740 --> 00:50:00,280
Do you still have that newspaper?

634
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:04,780
Yes, Henry. I do.

635
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:09,460
We should send Mr Strange
to the Peninsula.

636
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:13,460
~ Norrell won't be pleased.
~ Norrell never is.

637
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:20,210
Send him to Portugal?!

638
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:22,490
I'm astonished you would
even suggest such a thing.

639
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:25,090
Every man must be prepared to
make sacrifices for his country

640
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:26,330
in time of war.

641
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:28,010
Many thousands have already done so.

642
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:30,570
Yes, but they were soldiers.

643
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:32,850
Though I dare say a soldier
is valuable in his own way.

644
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:34,010
Have you considered, sir,

645
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:36,450
the great respect it might
achieve for English magic?

646
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,570
But nothing is more likely
to evoke the Raven King

647
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:40,890
and all that mischievous,
reckless sort of magic than

648
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:43,050
the sight of an English
magician on a battlefield.

649
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:45,410
People will start to think
that we consort with fairies

650
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:48,490
and talk to owls and
bears and... No, sir.

651
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:50,210
No, no, no, I'm afraid not.

652
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:52,890
Mr Strange must stay
and assist me and learn.

653
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:55,940
And nothing will sway
me from this. Nothing.

654
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:01,490
They are going to sell the
Duke of Roxburghe's books.

655
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:02,730
Well, now that he is dead,

656
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:05,770
the first concern of the new
Duke will be the estate's debts.

657
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:09,010
He will be looking for something
to sell, and yes, as you know,

658
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:13,610
he does have a very fine library
with many magical volumes.

659
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:15,530
What you afraid of now?

660
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:18,570
Book sales generally the thing
most calculated to please you.

661
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:19,890
Yes, but that was before.

662
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:22,530
When no-one in England had the
least interest in books of magic

663
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:26,810
but myself. Now I fear a great
many people might try to buy them.

664
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:30,170
And he has a copy of Revelations
of 36 Different Worlds.

665
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:32,410
I've been after that for years.

666
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:37,210
But if these books are bought
by someone else, you may

667
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,290
complain to the Ministers.

668
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:41,490
It is not in the interest
of the nation that

669
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:45,730
books of magic should be in anyone's
possession but your own.

670
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:48,810
Oh, except Strange, of course.

671
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:51,930
Oh, I had forgot Strange.

672
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:54,650
But surely Mr Strange would
understand that it is proper

673
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:57,650
~ for the books to be mine, would he not?
~ Oh.

674
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:59,930
Mr Strange is a gentleman.

675
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:02,370
He will behave as a gentleman
and expect you to do the same.

676
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:04,610
If the books were offered
privately to you alone then

677
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:05,730
I expect you may buy them.

678
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:10,130
But if they are auctioned, he will
feel entitled to bid against you.

679
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:12,250
And how do you suppose
these books will be sold?

680
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:14,970
By private transaction or by auction?

681
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:17,580
Auction.

682
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:21,650
Mr Strange, please.

683
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:24,250
Your leaving is of
great pain to me, sir.

684
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:25,970
It is of great pain.

685
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:29,530
I hope, sir, that your change of
heart does not result from any

686
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:31,170
offence I may have given you?

687
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:34,290
Oh, no, no. Mr Strange, in the past
I've feared the appearance of another

688
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:37,050
magician, but when it happened
I was in fact delighted.

689
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:40,610
I fear I am sending you
to the war unprepared.

690
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:42,690
In which case...

691
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:46,730
I wonder if I might take
some books with me?

692
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:47,810
Books?

693
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:50,330
I fear I shall need books,
if I am to perform magic.

694
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:54,290
I should not imagine I would need
to take more than about... 40.

695
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:57,650
~ 40!
~ Yes, you couldn't carry more than 40.

696
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:01,290
Carry them about?! No! No,
they must be in a library.

697
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:04,010
No, you must put them in
a library in a castle.

698
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:05,650
It is so very dirty abroad.

699
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:07,850
They shall be little use
to him in a library, sir.

700
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:11,130
He will be in camps and on
battlefields and so must they.

701
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:15,410
~ Can we not have some sort of iron box made?
~ Saddlebags.

702
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:17,450
Thank you, Childermass.

703
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,730
You have done so very
much for me, sir.

704
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:23,010
I hope with all my heart
to come back safely

705
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:26,860
and to live as your friend
and assistant once again.

706
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:32,540
Give me your list.

707
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:39,690
I believe Mr Strange will do
very well in the war, sir.

708
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:41,650
He's already outmanoeuvred you.

709
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:44,240
I wish I had never come to London.

710
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:51,100
I wish I had never undertaken
to restore English magic.

711
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:55,130
I should have stayed
at Hurtfew, reading

712
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:57,850
and doing spells for my own pleasure.

713
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:04,000
None of it is worth
the loss of 40 books!

714
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:15,490
You are of no help! Why
do you make me sleep?

715
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:18,250
Why does every request
you insist that I sleep?

716
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,410
Why can you not control yourself?

717
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:23,610
You're of no help! Nothing
you do is of any help!

718
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:26,410
Nothing is of the least help.
You do not understand.

719
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:28,850
~ What is it?
~ Sir, I...

720
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,730
Stephen, why is the house
in such disorder?

721
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:32,410
~ You don't understand.
~ Sir.

722
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:35,090
~ Why have you not found new staff?
~ I, uh...

723
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:37,650
You are as dull and heavy
as the rest of them.

724
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:39,170
Lost. I am lost.

725
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:42,090
Lady Pole is to be
confined to her room.

726
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:46,460
Lost. I am lost.

727
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:00,780
Good morning.

728
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:05,930
Well, not married a year and
he runs away to join the Army.

729
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:08,810
Wars do not last for ever, Bell.

730
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:11,400
But they do tend to be dangerous.

731
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:16,930
Jonathan, when I saw Lady Pole
at Harley Street I promised her

732
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,690
that I should tell you something.

733
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:20,280
What is it?

734
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:23,850
She told me that a man from
Halifax bought a new rug

735
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:25,810
and he fell asleep beside the fire

736
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:31,170
and when he awoke he saw lots of
little people running about upon it.

737
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:33,560
Lady Pole is not in her wits.

738
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:36,940
She hates Mr Norrell, Jonathan.

739
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:43,170
I must go. I love you, Bell.

740
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:46,690
I love you too.

741
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:48,340
Be careful.

742
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:55,650
I shall write every day. I
will look out for you, Bell.

743
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:58,640
I would rather you
look out for yourself.

744
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:25,930
Ah, ladies and gentlemen. If
I could have your attention.

745
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:28,130
Thank you. Gentlemen.

746
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:32,010
And we'll begin with an
assortment of volumes from the

747
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:34,050
Duke of Roxburghe's library.

748
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:36,610
This is the second greatest
collection of magical books

749
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:37,890
in the land.

750
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:42,770
And this first lot, who will
start me at 200 Guineas?

751
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:44,450
200 Guineas.

752
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:47,210
Do I hear any advance on
two...? 220 Guineas, sir.

753
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:52,170
Thank you. 240. 260. 260 Guineas?

754
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:55,410
280 Guineas. Thank you. 300 Guineas.

755
00:56:55,460 --> 00:57:00,370
300 Guineas. Do I hear any
advance on 300 Guineas?

756
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:02,210
And 300 Guineas.

757
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:05,850
350 Guineas, madam. Thank you.

758
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:10,170
400 Guineas. Thank
you, sir. 400 Guineas.

759
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:11,210
500 Guineas.

760
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:17,690
600. 700 Guineas. 800 Guineas, madam.

761
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:19,850
Thank you.

762
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:24,930
800 Guineas. Any advance on
800 Guineas? With the lady.

763
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:27,810
~ At 800 Guineas and...
~ Mr Norrell.

764
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:31,250
Going once, going twice, and...

765
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:33,690
Sir, sir, your books. Your books

766
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:35,410
2,000 Guineas!

767
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:39,250
2,000 Guineas.

768
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:43,370
Do I hear any advance on
2,000 Guineas? Going once.

769
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:46,090
Going twice. And sold.

770
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:48,340
Mr Norrell. Hanover Square.

771
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:59,340
No, thank you, no. Excuse me.
