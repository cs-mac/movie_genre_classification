1
00:00:02,866 --> 00:00:07,666
THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER

2
00:00:07,667 --> 00:00:10,667
Translated from the Finnish subtitles
by thumos - v5

3
00:01:13,367 --> 00:01:15,234
Rokka!

4
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
PALOAUKEA
June 1941

5
00:01:59,117 --> 00:02:01,526
Goddamn war-crazed lunatic!

6
00:02:09,201 --> 00:02:13,192
(Captain Kaarna) Hmph, perkele.
Goddamn fucking hell.

7
00:02:18,742 --> 00:02:21,442
Machine gun company!

8
00:02:24,867 --> 00:02:26,192
At ease.

9
00:02:28,951 --> 00:02:32,942
(Koskela) The battalion will be transported to another location by trucks.

10
00:02:32,992 --> 00:02:36,984
Thus, all extra equipment will be relinquished.

11
00:02:37,034 --> 00:02:41,776
Put another set of underwear, footwraps
and your overcoat in your pack.

12
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:47,067
And weapons, of course.

13
00:02:47,117 --> 00:02:51,484
Rest to storage. Hietanen oversees. Be quick about it.

14
00:02:51,534 --> 00:02:54,859
(Hietanen) Where are we headed? All the way to hell, I guess?

15
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:56,609
You'd better hurry.

16
00:02:57,534 --> 00:03:00,859
(Lahtinen) Boys, there's going to be a fight.

17
00:03:00,909 --> 00:03:04,151
That nutcase is going to take off from Germany,
and then our idiots will follow after him.

18
00:03:04,201 --> 00:03:07,776
The brass are afraid that Russia will come here
if they start fighting with Germany.

19
00:03:07,826 --> 00:03:10,859
What would they do here?
As far as I know, they've not attacked anybody.

20
00:03:10,909 --> 00:03:13,567
But we've already got Krauts here.

21
00:03:13,617 --> 00:03:20,692
Vanhala, battalion horse drivers said that
we're going to be sent to garrison Helsinki.

22
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:25,317
All old rags will be changed to new ones.
Every man will get riding breeches.

23
00:03:25,367 --> 00:03:27,942
That's what I heard.

24
00:03:29,534 --> 00:03:33,692
Attention!
- As you were.

25
00:03:34,242 --> 00:03:38,067
Do you know what it says on a boy scout's belt?

26
00:03:38,867 --> 00:03:41,026
"Be prepared."

27
00:03:43,451 --> 00:03:47,151
Coffee and a pretzel, please.

28
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:53,026
What would you like?
(Rahikainen) - What would the girl sell to Rahikainen on this last night?

29
00:03:53,659 --> 00:03:56,192
A cup of coffee, and a pretzel.

30
00:03:56,242 --> 00:03:59,901
We're selling as many pretzels as you want.
The cantina will be sold empty tonight.

31
00:03:59,951 --> 00:04:03,401
There it is. War is coming,
signs are in the air.

32
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:07,817
I wonder if I'll get to see
the girl's pretty eyes ever again?

33
00:04:07,867 --> 00:04:10,276
(Lammio)
Finish your business so others have a chance as well.

34
00:04:10,326 --> 00:04:15,151
Lieutenant, let's not get too hasty.
How much tobacco am I allowed?

35
00:04:15,201 --> 00:04:19,734
How much do you want?
- Let's say a packet. And around ten pretzels.

36
00:04:19,784 --> 00:04:22,609
Move your feet.

37
00:04:22,659 --> 00:04:28,192
Looks like that girl ain't gonna be the mother of your children.
You need pins on your collar for that.

38
00:04:28,242 --> 00:04:32,526
(Rahikainen) Well, as long as there's something under the collar.

39
00:04:34,576 --> 00:04:36,776
(Sirkka) I'm going to miss you.

40
00:04:38,367 --> 00:04:40,901
(Kariluoto) I'll return.
- You certain?

41
00:04:40,951 --> 00:04:43,692
Of course, if you wait.
- I'll wait.

42
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:46,026
Will you?

43
00:04:48,534 --> 00:04:50,651
I will.

44
00:04:53,742 --> 00:04:57,526
<i>I shall not abandon my squad, ship or flag -</i>

45
00:04:57,576 --> 00:05:01,276
<i>but as commanded,
and as long as there's strength in me -</i>

46
00:05:01,326 --> 00:05:06,234
<i>I will follow it with manly seriousness,
and defend it to my last drop of blood.</i>

47
00:05:33,992 --> 00:05:39,817
...A Bulwark never failing;

48
00:05:39,867 --> 00:05:47,442
Our Helper He amid the flood

49
00:05:47,492 --> 00:05:52,651
For still our ancient foe

50
00:05:52,701 --> 00:05:58,026
Doth seek to work us woe;

51
00:05:58,076 --> 00:06:03,109
His craft and power are great,

52
00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:09,109
And, armed with cruel hate,

53
00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:16,234
On earth is not his equal.

54
00:06:16,284 --> 00:06:23,526
Did we in our own strength confide...

55
00:06:25,576 --> 00:06:27,859
(Kaarna) A fine beginning.

56
00:06:28,742 --> 00:06:32,942
(Koskela) First half squad to this truck, second to the next one.

57
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:39,151
First and third squads, mount up!

58
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:45,942
Second and fourth, wait for the next free truck.

59
00:06:45,992 --> 00:06:49,984
Eki goddammit!
- Someone is sitting on my pack!

60
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:53,609
Goddammit.
- Watch it.

61
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:55,942
Move a little.

62
00:06:59,701 --> 00:07:06,317
Last greetings to you, Paloaukea!
Farewell forever, you sweat sponge!

63
00:07:06,951 --> 00:07:12,234
Be a very shitty place
for all new recruits!

64
00:07:12,284 --> 00:07:16,192
<i>(President Ryti) Citizens.
Our peace loving people -</i>

65
00:07:16,242 --> 00:07:20,609
<i>who for a second year already,
has stretched to the end of its strength -</i>

66
00:07:20,659 --> 00:07:25,609
<i>to rebuild our country to prosperity
after the last war -</i>

67
00:07:25,659 --> 00:07:29,609
<i>has once again been brutally attacked.</i>

68
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:37,109
<i>Once again the same enemy,
who for more than 500 years -</i>

69
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:43,442
<i>by destroying, crushing and murdering,
has warred against our small nation.</i>

70
00:07:44,284 --> 00:07:48,901
(Salo) When those guns start glowing,
our neighbour is going to get a beating.

71
00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:53,317
Herrings are a little slim for a Christmas dinner.
They've got guns on the other side too.

72
00:07:53,367 --> 00:07:56,609
It's not going to be as easy as they say.

73
00:07:56,659 --> 00:08:02,276
I don't know. Ostrobothnian boys had to be tied
to trees so they wouldn't rush off.

74
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,700
NORTHERN KARELIA
4th of July 1941

75
00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:17,359
Wake up. It's begun.

76
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:20,651
Guns are already singing their tune. Hurry up.

77
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:23,567
They're firing with a cannon.

78
00:08:23,617 --> 00:08:27,317
Still going far. Can't even hear the whistle.

79
00:08:27,367 --> 00:08:29,859
Cannons are singing.

80
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:32,776
(Koskela) We go with third company.

81
00:08:32,826 --> 00:08:36,776
Nothing much to it,
but you have to take it calmly...

82
00:08:36,826 --> 00:08:39,317
Aim at the belt, that's the best way.

83
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:44,526
Just remember they're
no different from other people.

84
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:51,109
They obey lead,
just like everyone else.

85
00:08:52,284 --> 00:08:54,484
All right, get moving.

86
00:09:18,701 --> 00:09:22,192
Autio promised me two of your machine guns.
- I know.

87
00:09:22,242 --> 00:09:26,526
Fire as fast as you can then, Ville.

88
00:09:26,576 --> 00:09:29,067
See you there.

89
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,151
(Koskela) Move.

90
00:09:33,742 --> 00:09:37,567
(Lahtinen) Men are already getting cold there.

91
00:09:45,617 --> 00:09:47,776
(Autio) Kariluoto.

92
00:09:48,409 --> 00:09:51,151
Artillery will fire a barrage in front of the second.

93
00:09:51,201 --> 00:09:53,942
After that, advance without a separate command.

94
00:09:53,992 --> 00:09:57,359
Don't let 'em stop, try to make it in one go.

95
00:09:57,409 --> 00:10:00,901
Under no circumstance can you let 'em lie down under fire.

96
00:10:02,284 --> 00:10:05,067
Good luck.

97
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:12,192
Fire!

98
00:10:36,784 --> 00:10:40,526
Fourth, forward!
- Forward!

99
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:55,192
Fourth, forward!

100
00:10:56,326 --> 00:11:00,567
Don't lie down under fire. Forward!

101
00:11:05,284 --> 00:11:08,109
Don't stop!

102
00:11:09,326 --> 00:11:12,026
Machine guns into position.

103
00:11:19,826 --> 00:11:21,609
Forward!

104
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:24,817
Forw...Forward.

105
00:11:31,451 --> 00:11:34,859
Shoot for their nuts!
- Shoot for their nuts!

106
00:12:09,909 --> 00:12:12,192
It's a tank.

107
00:12:12,909 --> 00:12:15,109
(Mielonen) I doubt it.

108
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:19,359
(Kaarna) Sure you can doubt it, it's still a tank.

109
00:12:20,367 --> 00:12:24,192
Well, well. Berries are coming along nicely.

110
00:12:24,242 --> 00:12:28,109
They're blossoming beautifully.

111
00:12:28,784 --> 00:12:30,567
What's...?

112
00:12:31,201 --> 00:12:32,984
What's this?

113
00:12:33,034 --> 00:12:37,651
No, no, no, boys, boys, boys.
You're mistaken.

114
00:12:37,701 --> 00:12:40,692
You don't fight a war like this.

115
00:12:40,742 --> 00:12:44,984
Our neighbouring company has already
advanced to the enemy's positions.

116
00:12:45,034 --> 00:12:49,276
Let's cross that damn bog in a hurry.

117
00:12:51,701 --> 00:12:54,442
Let's try it again, 2nd Lieutenant.

118
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:58,901
You'll get the hang of it.

119
00:13:00,326 --> 00:13:04,026
Cut them down, son of the North!

120
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:06,359
Move it!

121
00:13:06,409 --> 00:13:08,734
Get moving!

122
00:13:08,784 --> 00:13:13,859
Cut them down, son of the North!

123
00:13:19,784 --> 00:13:23,192
Medic, medic!

124
00:13:23,242 --> 00:13:27,651
Cut them down, son of North!
- Fourth, forward!

125
00:13:43,867 --> 00:13:48,317
Not a single dead Russki. Not a single one,
I checked when we came.

126
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:53,484
(Sihvonen)
Hey, one's lying down here.

127
00:13:56,284 --> 00:14:01,942
(Lahtinen) I guess they don't care much for each other.
They left him here to crawl.

128
00:14:01,992 --> 00:14:04,442
Goddammit.

129
00:14:06,409 --> 00:14:09,776
Hello. Say, is it cold in Russki's hell?

130
00:14:10,867 --> 00:14:13,067
(Hietanen) What you got there?

131
00:14:13,117 --> 00:14:15,817
Show me.
- These are mine.

132
00:14:15,867 --> 00:14:19,317
(Hietanen) Give me.
What's this? "Konek, konek."

133
00:14:19,367 --> 00:14:23,359
Who the hell is that beard fellow?

134
00:14:23,409 --> 00:14:25,442
That's Lenin.

135
00:14:25,492 --> 00:14:30,692
Such a slant eye that he sees both Sundays on a Wednesday.

136
00:14:34,326 --> 00:14:38,234
Oh. Hey boys, a little lavender perfume?

137
00:14:38,284 --> 00:14:42,151
(Ukkola) Lieutenant.
(Autio) - Kariluoto.

138
00:14:42,201 --> 00:14:46,567
A brisk start.
How did it feel?

139
00:14:46,617 --> 00:14:52,401
Good, as soon as I got going.
Couldn't almost get 'em moving.

140
00:14:55,284 --> 00:14:58,692
Captain Kaarna...
- I heard.

141
00:14:58,742 --> 00:15:02,776
But, great thanks. You did well.

142
00:15:04,617 --> 00:15:07,651
(Koskela)
Form up and get moving.

143
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:31,776
<i>(Sirkka)
Now is our time. Finland's time.</i>

144
00:15:31,826 --> 00:15:35,817
<i>To demand back what was lost.</i>

145
00:15:37,492 --> 00:15:40,151
<i>That's our right.</i>

146
00:15:42,076 --> 00:15:44,859
<i>Isn't it?</i>

147
00:15:49,951 --> 00:15:54,276
"Say, is it cold in Russki's hell?"

148
00:16:17,534 --> 00:16:22,234
(Hietanen) If I was God,
I wouldn't have made stars.

149
00:16:22,284 --> 00:16:24,859
If I could, I'd break 'em.

150
00:16:24,909 --> 00:16:28,776
What's the point of them when they don't do anything?

151
00:16:29,992 --> 00:16:35,067
God didn't create them, that's just talk.

152
00:16:35,117 --> 00:16:38,067
Neither were people.

153
00:16:38,117 --> 00:16:44,317
People were born in the sea.
People are made out of carbon and other things.

154
00:16:44,367 --> 00:16:49,692
The simple man is kept in ignorance so he’ll be 
more submissive to the capitalists.

155
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:52,109
Carbon?

156
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:56,151
In the sea? Carbon?

157
00:16:56,201 --> 00:17:00,151
Lahtinen. You're talking crazy stuff.

158
00:17:00,201 --> 00:17:03,192
How the hell could people be born in the sea?

159
00:17:03,242 --> 00:17:06,317
If you're underwater for half a minute,
you're out of breath.

160
00:17:06,367 --> 00:17:10,359
You can be underwater if you have gills.

161
00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:13,651
People are made out of meat and bones,
anyone can tell you that.

162
00:17:13,701 --> 00:17:17,234
People were fish in the beginning.
- Fish?

163
00:17:17,284 --> 00:17:21,234
Even a capitalist scientist has recognized that.

164
00:17:21,284 --> 00:17:24,151
Goddamn. A fish?

165
00:17:24,201 --> 00:17:29,942
Vanhala, I'm a perch.
I'm a perch made out of carbon. A perch, yeah.

166
00:17:32,742 --> 00:17:37,067
Nature is what creates, that's how it is.
Everything else is hogwash.

167
00:17:37,117 --> 00:17:41,442
Rich people know what tune to sing,
when it's about their money.

168
00:17:41,492 --> 00:17:45,151
And off we go again,
we'll see how this pans out.

169
00:17:45,201 --> 00:17:49,359
We'll see.
There's a lot of men they can throw against us.

170
00:17:49,409 --> 00:17:54,109
But a Finnish soldier is worth ten Russkis.
- I guess so.

171
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:58,859
But what do you do when the eleventh comes?

172
00:18:05,242 --> 00:18:09,651
Crawl forward, goddammit!
Boys, get fucking moving!

173
00:18:09,701 --> 00:18:12,234
Boys, forward!

174
00:18:13,951 --> 00:18:16,359
Forward!

175
00:18:39,867 --> 00:18:43,401
Whole battery, fire three times,
targets one and two.

176
00:18:43,451 --> 00:18:48,192
Three men have fallen,
I just lost my best squad leader.

177
00:18:48,242 --> 00:18:50,776
Whole battalion is already in it.

178
00:18:50,826 --> 00:18:55,192
If you get through, this will be your day.
You know I won't be spareful with the praise.

179
00:18:55,242 --> 00:18:58,734
I'll do everything I can,
as long as I get the men moving.

180
00:19:25,409 --> 00:19:27,651
Fourth, forward!

181
00:19:27,701 --> 00:19:31,734
Forward!
Forward, fourth!

182
00:19:35,701 --> 00:19:38,942
(Koskela)
Let it be. You'll get yourself killed for no reason.

183
00:19:38,992 --> 00:19:42,526
If one man could get close with a satchel charge.

184
00:19:44,076 --> 00:19:47,067
I'll try.
- I'll go.

185
00:19:47,867 --> 00:19:54,151
That's my job, not yours.
- Your job is to get the men moving.

186
00:20:03,701 --> 00:20:09,359
(Koskela) Lehto! When I go, the machine gun has to fire nonstop!
- Got it!

187
00:20:40,451 --> 00:20:43,276
Make room for Lehto!
- Take him away!

188
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:45,526
Lehto!

189
00:22:19,617 --> 00:22:21,609
(Kariluoto) They're falling back!

190
00:22:22,492 --> 00:22:24,776
First squad...Viirilä!

191
00:22:25,201 --> 00:22:31,234
First and second to the right!
Third and fourth to the left! Mäntynen!

192
00:22:37,242 --> 00:22:38,817
Mäntynen!

193
00:22:52,951 --> 00:22:55,151
Viirilä!

194
00:23:09,367 --> 00:23:11,692
(Kariluoto)
Let's keep moving.

195
00:23:12,867 --> 00:23:15,359
We don't have time for looting.

196
00:23:16,492 --> 00:23:18,692
Let's go forward.

197
00:23:34,409 --> 00:23:39,276
No human is truly evil,
but many of us are weak.

198
00:23:39,326 --> 00:23:44,734
There's much good in everyone,
even though it may be hidden today.

199
00:23:45,951 --> 00:23:48,151
Well...

200
00:23:52,701 --> 00:23:56,442
Have you gotten food?
- Yes, we have, Major.

201
00:23:56,492 --> 00:24:01,026
I see. Do you boys have tobacco?
- Yes, Major.

202
00:24:01,076 --> 00:24:03,901
(Hietanen) We're rolling mahorka cigarettes, Major.

203
00:24:03,951 --> 00:24:07,276
I see, and how do they taste?

204
00:24:07,326 --> 00:24:11,276
Like home-grown tobacco, Major.
Tastes the same everywhere.

205
00:24:11,326 --> 00:24:13,401
Well, of course.

206
00:24:31,576 --> 00:24:34,317
I found potatoes!
- Potatoes?

207
00:24:36,534 --> 00:24:39,442
(Hietanen) Change carriers.
- Vanhala.

208
00:24:39,492 --> 00:24:44,109
(Vanhala) I just carried it the longest.
(Lehto) - Don't whine, goddammit. Give me that stand.

209
00:24:52,201 --> 00:24:54,401
(Ukkola) Can you believe that I'm hungry?

210
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:58,109
(Vanhala) How long do they think
us forest warriors will march with these rations?

211
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,609
They don't think,
they know.

212
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:04,567
They've counted the calories,
or whatever the hell they are.

213
00:25:04,617 --> 00:25:07,817
Go complain and they'll show you such a calculation -

214
00:25:07,867 --> 00:25:11,317
that proves that you can't be hungry.

215
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:16,651
Lehto. Don't you know that's forbidden?

216
00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:22,567
So is killing.

217
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:46,442
I've never seen such gluttons.

218
00:25:50,409 --> 00:25:54,442
(Hietanen) Boys...
I don't believe in calories -

219
00:25:54,492 --> 00:25:59,901
or in anything else supernatural,
but I know one thing for certain.

220
00:25:59,951 --> 00:26:05,734
Lahtinen thinks for sure that calories
were invented by the capitalist.

221
00:26:07,201 --> 00:26:10,442
I don't know anything about capitalists -

222
00:26:10,492 --> 00:26:14,942
but if my old man dies before me,
I'll get 9,5 hectares...

223
00:26:45,076 --> 00:26:47,734
He's running there.

224
00:26:49,201 --> 00:26:51,401
(Lahtinen) Rukiver!

225
00:26:54,201 --> 00:26:56,359
Stoi!

226
00:26:57,992 --> 00:26:59,901
Rukiver.

227
00:27:09,951 --> 00:27:13,776
(Koskela) Check if anyone else is around.
Search his pockets.

228
00:27:16,992 --> 00:27:20,401
Superpower's gear doesn't look that great.

229
00:27:20,451 --> 00:27:23,026
(Rahikainen) Tavaritsia, tavaritsia?

230
00:27:23,076 --> 00:27:26,151
Anyone else? Bonimai?

231
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:36,234
He could've blown us up with himself.

232
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:46,317
He's not that kind of a man.
You can see that.

233
00:27:47,784 --> 00:27:50,567
Vanja boy, rastui.

234
00:27:50,617 --> 00:27:54,401
He needs to be taken to the command post. Who will go?
(Lehto) - I'll go.

235
00:27:54,451 --> 00:27:56,817
Walk that way.

236
00:28:08,784 --> 00:28:10,984
Go, go.

237
00:28:43,784 --> 00:28:46,317
What did he do?
- Died.

238
00:28:46,367 --> 00:28:49,151
Did he try to escape?
- Yes.

239
00:28:49,201 --> 00:28:51,526
That wasn't necessary.
He wasn't that sort of a man.

240
00:28:51,576 --> 00:28:56,276
Damned if I'm going to sort 'em out?
- You shot him in the back. He didn't try to escape.

241
00:28:56,326 --> 00:29:01,067
"In the back!" Better that than from the front.
Easier for him. Start crying, goddammit.

242
00:29:01,117 --> 00:29:04,984
Shoot for all I care.
I'm no military judge.

243
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:07,359
But that man was afraid enough as he was.

244
00:29:07,409 --> 00:29:11,109
We don't start to cry for one Russki.

245
00:29:14,034 --> 00:29:17,609
Well then, let's keep moving.

246
00:29:28,659 --> 00:29:32,817
How many days will the march last?
(General) - Infantry is used to this.

247
00:29:32,867 --> 00:29:36,109
A Finnish soldier will march for a week.

248
00:29:39,034 --> 00:29:41,234
Out of the way!

249
00:29:43,492 --> 00:29:46,192
Don't touch the car!

250
00:29:51,951 --> 00:29:56,151
Throw up some dust on a grunt's eyes, goddammit.

251
00:29:56,201 --> 00:30:01,234
No sign of a fuel shortage,
when they take their field whores for a ride.

252
00:30:23,326 --> 00:30:26,151
(Hietanen) Boys, the old border.

253
00:30:29,117 --> 00:30:31,859
We're in Russia now.

254
00:30:31,909 --> 00:30:36,526
Right now, at this moment,
this lad stepped into foreign soil.

255
00:30:36,576 --> 00:30:41,942
Our rights end here. From now on,
we're a pack of bandits.

256
00:30:41,992 --> 00:30:46,234
(Ukkola) Sure, we're the bandits,
when we cross borders.

257
00:30:46,284 --> 00:30:49,609
But the others are just protecting their security,
when they redraw borders.

258
00:30:49,659 --> 00:30:52,317
We've marched across Karelian song country.

259
00:30:52,367 --> 00:30:56,609
Weren't there some old men and women here,
who sang sad laments?

260
00:30:56,659 --> 00:30:59,109
We have reason for a few laments ourselves.

261
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:02,317
Now that we've crossed the border,
they'll start fighting back for real.

262
00:31:02,367 --> 00:31:07,192
There's a few troops ahead of us,
we won't be sent to the line right away.

263
00:31:07,242 --> 00:31:12,651
(Lahtinen) We're building that Greater Finland.
Got their heads so hot they got steam coming out their noses.

264
00:31:12,701 --> 00:31:15,109
(Vanhala) Suhna superpower in the making!

265
00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:19,192
(Salo) They're saying it's three weeks,
and we'll be back in the hayfields.

266
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
HOME FRONT
August 1941

267
00:33:15,867 --> 00:33:19,692
(Rokka) So, I guess this here
is the company commander.

268
00:33:19,742 --> 00:33:23,401
We're replacements.
I guess the Major called that we're coming.

269
00:33:23,451 --> 00:33:29,567
There's papers for the both of us.
- So, what's... You're a Corporal.

270
00:33:29,617 --> 00:33:32,734
That I am.
They gave me these stripes in the Winter War.

271
00:33:32,784 --> 00:33:36,276
For what reason, I don't know,
as I've never hurt anybody.

272
00:33:36,326 --> 00:33:38,692
Listen Lieutenant,
put us in the same squad.

273
00:33:38,742 --> 00:33:42,317
We're neighbours,
and we've been together since the Winter War.

274
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:45,067
You have to remember that
this is not a reserve regiment.

275
00:33:45,117 --> 00:33:50,567
We don't address superiors informally here,
because it would weaken discipline among conscripts.

276
00:33:50,617 --> 00:33:54,401
Is that so? Well I didn't know that.

277
00:33:54,451 --> 00:33:59,609
But I'm just saying that make sure we're
put in the same group with Sus' Paw here.

278
00:34:00,201 --> 00:34:03,067
Who?
- Sus' Paw.

279
00:34:04,076 --> 00:34:06,984
What's your name?

280
00:34:07,034 --> 00:34:10,734
Pr-pr-private Sus is my name.

281
00:34:10,784 --> 00:34:12,984
So Susi?

282
00:34:15,617 --> 00:34:19,942
And what's your name?
- I'm Rokka. Antero is my first name.

283
00:34:19,992 --> 00:34:24,609
But I've been called Antti my whole life,
and I even say so myself.

284
00:34:26,492 --> 00:34:31,484
That fella thinks highly of himself, if there's
any more like him, we'll not like it here.

285
00:34:31,534 --> 00:34:34,567
We'll always manage.
Don't you worry at all.

286
00:34:34,617 --> 00:34:40,901
He's very young still. We've managed before.
- Su-sure we have.

287
00:34:48,367 --> 00:34:52,317
Goddamn how they're firing with the cannons.
That's where we're headed soon.

288
00:34:52,367 --> 00:34:58,442
Listen here 2nd Lieutenant, we're leaving today.
- Have you been at the front before?

289
00:34:58,492 --> 00:35:02,109
In Taipale, dreadful place.
We're from the Isthmus.

290
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:05,651
They took our farms,
but not our lives, no matter how they tried.

291
00:35:05,701 --> 00:35:08,234
We'll see if they manage to get us now.

292
00:35:08,284 --> 00:35:13,817
I wanted to go to the Isthmus. That's where I have
unfinished business with the neighbour.

293
00:35:13,867 --> 00:35:17,651
It doesn't matter where we fight.
There’s cabins up for the taking
all the way to Smolensk.

294
00:35:17,701 --> 00:35:21,276
I don't know about Smolensk,
they've praised the Fritz -

295
00:35:21,326 --> 00:35:25,942
but on the way here, I saw them
clicking their heels a bit too much.

296
00:35:25,992 --> 00:35:29,526
But we don't care about that,
Europe can go to hell.

297
00:35:29,576 --> 00:35:32,484
We'll take back Karelia,
and then we're going home.

298
00:35:33,284 --> 00:35:35,692
Get ready.
- For what?

299
00:35:35,742 --> 00:35:38,026
Well, to attack.

300
00:35:41,242 --> 00:35:45,234
(Rokka) Assault boats.
They want to make marine animals out of us.

301
00:35:45,284 --> 00:35:49,692
(Susi) We're in the shit now.
- Oh, don't fret. It's just water.

302
00:35:49,742 --> 00:35:55,526
What does it matter if you die
on water or on land?

303
00:35:55,576 --> 00:35:59,609
Don't speak of death,
I'll get a bad stomach.

304
00:35:59,659 --> 00:36:03,234
Listen 2nd Lieutenant.
- Yes?

305
00:36:03,284 --> 00:36:05,609
We're crossing that river in a bit.

306
00:36:06,992 --> 00:36:12,109
I know.
- Well, all right then. Just take it calmly.

307
00:36:20,784 --> 00:36:23,109
Mount the machine gun with the stand on the bow.

308
00:36:26,034 --> 00:36:29,817
Why, my friend, surely you see it's pointless
to use the stand for that crossing.

309
00:36:29,867 --> 00:36:32,442
It will just slow us down
during the landing.

310
00:36:32,492 --> 00:36:35,817
I'm not your friend,
I'm your company commander.

311
00:36:35,867 --> 00:36:39,484
Don't think so.
At most we'll mount it without the stand.

312
00:36:39,534 --> 00:36:42,651
You'll do as you're told!

313
00:37:22,034 --> 00:37:24,567
Move!
- Move!

314
00:37:30,659 --> 00:37:33,484
Second wave, get ready!

315
00:38:09,326 --> 00:38:11,442
Forward!

316
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:16,317
Sarge!
- Forward!

317
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:30,901
Give me that belt.

318
00:38:34,492 --> 00:38:36,942
(Rokka) That goddamn machine gun.

319
00:38:42,742 --> 00:38:46,151
All right! Let's rush 'em now!

320
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:50,984
Paw. You come feed the belt.
Give me that rifle.

321
00:38:51,034 --> 00:38:53,234
Assault!

322
00:38:54,034 --> 00:38:56,192
Jeesus perkele!

323
00:39:06,034 --> 00:39:10,442
Give me that submachine gun. You take grenades.
- Grenades.

324
00:39:14,617 --> 00:39:20,526
As the grenade explodes, I go around the corner and finish them off.
Then we advance to the next corner.

325
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:22,567
Go ahead.

326
00:40:00,742 --> 00:40:03,234
New magazine!

327
00:40:13,576 --> 00:40:16,234
Give me a submachine gun!

328
00:40:28,284 --> 00:40:32,609
This is a damn good gun.
We only had a few of these in the Winter War.

329
00:40:54,409 --> 00:40:59,442
Don't you try aiming at me.
That means death, I'm a hasty man.

330
00:40:59,492 --> 00:41:02,067
Corporal.

331
00:41:02,951 --> 00:41:05,442
What's your name?
- I'm Rokka.

332
00:41:05,492 --> 00:41:09,692
Antero is my first name.
I already reported to our 2nd Lieutenant.

333
00:41:11,242 --> 00:41:15,526
That was excellent work.
- Don't you try praising me.

334
00:41:15,576 --> 00:41:20,109
You want to do heroic deeds,
I don't give a damn about none of that.

335
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:23,984
You go when the situation demands it,
otherwise you keep low.

336
00:41:24,034 --> 00:41:30,151
We're not here to die,
we're here to kill. All right, off we go.

337
00:41:31,534 --> 00:41:35,859
Paw, take that tent tarp from that fallen guy.
It'll make a good blanket.

338
00:41:35,909 --> 00:41:39,484
Autumn rains will start soon.
- Move it!

339
00:41:39,534 --> 00:41:43,359
Everyone alive?
- We are, no worries here.

340
00:41:44,326 --> 00:41:46,859
Next we'll take Petroskoi.

341
00:41:46,909 --> 00:41:50,734
And then we'll go home.
What do you think of that, Vanhala?

342
00:41:50,784 --> 00:41:53,026
Petroskohoi...
- Kihi kihi.

343
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:18,484
Saatana...

344
00:42:24,951 --> 00:42:31,151
That has to last for three days.
- Of course it has to, when you don't give more.

345
00:42:34,492 --> 00:42:37,984
Yup, it's a horse.

346
00:42:38,034 --> 00:42:42,401
You can see a whip mark here.
- Don't whine about the food.

347
00:42:42,451 --> 00:42:47,234
The meat is up to the standards.
- Who can say something like that?

348
00:42:47,284 --> 00:42:50,484
First Sergeant Sinkkonen,
company's new Master Sergeant.

349
00:42:50,534 --> 00:42:52,817
The food is good,
considering the circumstances.

350
00:42:52,867 --> 00:42:56,942
Considering the circumstances,
I'd prefer that you don't kick over my mess kit.

351
00:42:56,992 --> 00:43:02,151
Well sure, I guess it isn't the horse's fault
if it gets tougher as it ages.

352
00:43:02,201 --> 00:43:06,192
Better men have fulfilled their duties
without complaining.

353
00:43:06,242 --> 00:43:10,609
You're quite something.
You crack jokes like they was serious.

354
00:43:10,659 --> 00:43:14,317
We have to have fun here.
Join our group, we'll put together an orchestra.

355
00:43:14,367 --> 00:43:17,651
Take a pot and start drumming.

356
00:43:19,534 --> 00:43:24,026
The boot hits the floorboards,
like you hit an ace on the card table

357
00:43:24,076 --> 00:43:28,359
The children can't stay put,
unless you tie 'em down

358
00:43:28,409 --> 00:43:32,234
The violin screams hiitula-hiituu,
the accordion goes halapata-paa

359
00:43:32,284 --> 00:43:37,317
Do you hear how the violins sing?
- What kind of circus is this?

360
00:43:38,951 --> 00:43:42,526
The new Master Sergeant,
he has a gloomy mind.

361
00:43:42,576 --> 00:43:47,567
We thought we'd give him some joy,
but apparently he's not fond of music.

362
00:43:50,367 --> 00:43:53,234
Quit your antics.

363
00:43:53,659 --> 00:43:56,609
The company has to be ready to march in an hour.

364
00:43:56,659 --> 00:44:01,984
Those without a white handkerchief,
get a piece of white paper.

365
00:44:02,034 --> 00:44:03,901
Get to work.

366
00:44:04,326 --> 00:44:06,276
Sinkkonen.

367
00:44:08,076 --> 00:44:11,984
We're going deep into the forest,
all through the night.

368
00:44:12,826 --> 00:44:17,651
Paw, eat your porridge.
Eat it all so you'll have enough strength.

369
00:44:23,117 --> 00:44:26,901
(Lahtinen)
When are the Krauts getting to Moscow?

370
00:44:27,867 --> 00:44:32,067
(Hietanen) Big thing happening, boys.
Whole regiment is moving.

371
00:44:54,742 --> 00:44:57,109
(Rokka) Take my hand.

372
00:44:57,159 --> 00:45:01,859
Flanking is proceeding well.
No sign of the enemy.

373
00:45:06,742 --> 00:45:09,234
(Rahikainen)
Try to carry the clothes you've got on.

374
00:45:09,284 --> 00:45:13,359
My comradeship
has its limits, Riitaoja.

375
00:45:13,409 --> 00:45:18,026
Give me your backpack and get up.
Fucking get up!

376
00:45:18,076 --> 00:45:24,151
Give me that backpack, goddammit!
You're one cross to carry!

377
00:45:24,201 --> 00:45:27,984
Get up!
- Don't kick him!

378
00:45:28,034 --> 00:45:32,234
You should get a string of bullets through you.
- Try your luck, asshole.

379
00:45:32,909 --> 00:45:34,484
Let it be.

380
00:45:35,867 --> 00:45:38,942
Of all the motherfucking pansies,
I have to drag you along.

381
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:56,442
Who will go?
- First will go.

382
00:45:56,492 --> 00:45:59,401
There's almost certainly something there.

383
00:45:59,451 --> 00:46:02,442
If our second has left,
you return to the road.

384
00:46:02,492 --> 00:46:06,984
Vanhala and Rahikainen with me. I won't take Riitaoja.
- Lahtinen will give one of his men.

385
00:46:07,034 --> 00:46:08,984
Sihvonen.
- Me, why of course!

386
00:46:09,034 --> 00:46:13,067
(Lammio) Quit grumbling.
Riitaoja must fulfill his duty.

387
00:46:29,284 --> 00:46:34,859
Where the hell is second platoon?
(Vanhala) - What if we all headed back to Finland?

388
00:46:34,909 --> 00:46:39,651
We'd go home and say we got lost.

389
00:46:39,701 --> 00:46:43,901
Quit your yapping.
I'll go ahead a bit.

390
00:47:29,784 --> 00:47:31,526
Riitaoja!

391
00:47:49,409 --> 00:47:51,609
Let's leave, boys.

392
00:47:54,076 --> 00:47:56,817
Let's not stay here to be killed.

393
00:48:40,201 --> 00:48:44,817
And Lehto was dead?
- I don't know, he didn't answer when we yelled.

394
00:48:53,117 --> 00:48:59,151
I'm just so damn puzzled.
So damn puzzled.

395
00:48:59,201 --> 00:49:03,567
This looks like a grand mystery.
A true mystery show.

396
00:49:04,992 --> 00:49:08,151
How can a dead guy shoot himself?

397
00:49:11,201 --> 00:49:14,942
Rokka. You take command of first squad.

398
00:49:14,992 --> 00:49:19,734
Sihvonen to Lahtinen. Take Susi to your squad.
- That'll suit me fine.

399
00:49:19,784 --> 00:49:22,984
All right. Start checking positions.

400
00:49:44,034 --> 00:49:46,984
All right, boys. We're not leaving here,
no matter what.

401
00:49:49,409 --> 00:49:52,484
Vanhala, let's wait a bit.

402
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:21,859
Fire!

403
00:50:24,992 --> 00:50:27,942
It doesn't work on that!

404
00:50:30,117 --> 00:50:33,442
Boys, the tanks are coming now!
- Let's leave, quickly!

405
00:50:42,159 --> 00:50:44,526
Run!
- Get back!

406
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:13,692
(Sarastie) Thank you.

407
00:53:14,992 --> 00:53:19,776
They got a bloody nose just now.
Let’s go and give a kick to their butts next.

408
00:53:19,826 --> 00:53:22,567
They're after that nickel up in Petsamo.

409
00:53:22,617 --> 00:53:27,942
Well, we're generous fellows.
Let's go and give them as much as they want.

410
00:53:30,201 --> 00:53:33,192
That's the way. Koskela.

411
00:53:34,326 --> 00:53:37,109
Get ready.

412
00:53:46,284 --> 00:53:49,442
(Rahikainen)
Aren't they running out of men?

413
00:53:49,492 --> 00:53:52,567
(Lahtinen) Listen, they won't run out of men.

414
00:53:52,617 --> 00:53:56,442
Plenty of men and stuff up there.
And if the men are spent -

415
00:53:56,492 --> 00:54:01,109
they've got 15 million female soldiers.
Everyone's received training, even the old hags.

416
00:54:01,159 --> 00:54:02,734
(Vanhala) That would lead to some intense close combat.

417
00:54:02,784 --> 00:54:07,026
Even Rahikainen would get awarded
with the Mannerheim Cross.

418
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:15,000
SOVIET KARELIA
September 1941

419
00:55:03,576 --> 00:55:06,317
Medic!
- Medic!

420
00:55:09,284 --> 00:55:13,609
Soldiers!
Remember who you are!

421
00:55:13,659 --> 00:55:17,942
Not a step backwards!
Men!

422
00:55:19,076 --> 00:55:22,026
Petroskoi awaits!

423
00:55:26,992 --> 00:55:29,817
Mäntynen! Let's go!

424
00:55:57,409 --> 00:56:02,901
I'm going to Father!
- Don't move, It'll just hurt worse.

425
00:56:02,951 --> 00:56:07,651
You pray! I can't do it!

426
00:56:09,034 --> 00:56:12,276
Our Father who art in heaven,

427
00:56:14,117 --> 00:56:17,234
hallowed be thy name.

428
00:56:19,659 --> 00:56:25,109
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

429
00:56:36,117 --> 00:56:40,067
<i> Give us this day our daily bread...</i>

430
00:56:40,992 --> 00:56:44,567
<i> ...and forgive us our trespasses...</i>

431
00:56:47,576 --> 00:56:52,484
<i>...as we forgive those who trespass against us...</i>

432
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:59,151
<i> ...and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.</i>

433
00:56:59,201 --> 00:57:04,776
<i>For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory...</i>

434
00:57:06,076 --> 00:57:07,942
<i>for ever and ever.</i>

435
00:57:11,826 --> 00:57:14,026
<i>Amen.</i>

436
00:57:22,326 --> 00:57:27,067
We're in Russia.
- Petroskoi, Petroskoi...

437
00:57:27,117 --> 00:57:31,526
We're not leaving from there, not anywhere.
Perkele!

438
00:57:31,576 --> 00:57:35,776
For home, religion and Fatherland,
goddammit.

439
00:58:07,117 --> 00:58:10,067
We've been fighting for that damn dump.

440
00:58:10,117 --> 00:58:13,526
Other troops are already there,
grabbing all the good stuff.

441
00:58:13,576 --> 00:58:18,317
(Hietanen) Boys, this is a historical event.
There lies a new city of Finland.

442
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:31,000
PETROSKOI
1st of October 1941

443
00:58:41,576 --> 00:58:44,984
Booze factory has been taken!

444
00:59:12,867 --> 00:59:18,192
Mannerheim said...
- Piss in your bottles!

445
00:59:18,242 --> 00:59:23,359
(Lautsalo) Booze factory has been taken!
Walk, what you mean walk? Hellurei!

446
00:59:23,409 --> 00:59:27,109
2nd Lieutenant Kariluoto,
8th infantry regiment, 1st battalion, 3rd company.

447
00:59:28,534 --> 00:59:33,901
Welcome to Hermanni's youth club!
I'm in command here!

448
00:59:33,951 --> 00:59:39,734
We conquered Petroskoi.
Objective has been reached.

449
00:59:48,242 --> 00:59:51,526
It fell quickly.

450
01:00:03,409 --> 01:00:06,734
Are you running around here by yourself?

451
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,200
Äänislinna, former Petroskoi
12th of October 1941

452
01:00:17,784 --> 01:00:22,484
Machine gun company!
Eyes - right!

453
01:00:37,034 --> 01:00:39,817
Eyes - front!

454
01:00:49,534 --> 01:00:53,401
(Hietanen) What kind of flailing is that?
Scrub it well.

455
01:00:53,451 --> 01:00:58,192
One of Stalin's messes.
- "Welcome to Hermanni's youth club!"

456
01:00:59,701 --> 01:01:02,901
We're abroad now.

457
01:01:06,576 --> 01:01:11,942
<i>As the fighting ends in Aunus
and as the Svir river has been reached -</i>

458
01:01:11,992 --> 01:01:16,109
<i>Finnish troops were reorganized for a new offensive -</i>

459
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:18,276
<i>towards Äänisjärvi and Äänislinna -</i>

460
01:01:18,326 --> 01:01:22,109
<i>which still at that time carried
the Russki-sounding name of Petroskoi.</i>

461
01:01:25,076 --> 01:01:31,151
<i>The glorious Blue Cross Flag of Finland
is now flown over this liberated land.</i>

462
01:01:31,617 --> 01:01:34,026
(Rahikainen)
Which one does the pastor want?

463
01:01:38,159 --> 01:01:40,651
I'll take this.

464
01:01:40,701 --> 01:01:46,526
I also have canned goods from America.
- No thanks.

465
01:01:46,576 --> 01:01:49,776
Maybe next time.

466
01:01:50,951 --> 01:01:54,776
Was the girl good?
- Yes.

467
01:02:19,951 --> 01:02:23,609
Shoot the Russki between the eyes,
that ought to bring them down.

468
01:02:23,659 --> 01:02:27,817
Between the eyes, between the eyes,
shoot the Russki between the eyes!

469
01:02:27,867 --> 01:02:31,109
A Russki shall give us no trouble,
we are used to their kind.

470
01:02:31,159 --> 01:02:34,859
Between the eyes, between the eyes,
shoot the Russki between the eyes!

471
01:02:34,909 --> 01:02:38,234
Shoot the Russki between the eyes,
that ought to bring them down.

472
01:02:38,284 --> 01:02:40,651
Between the eyes, between the eyes...

473
01:02:40,701 --> 01:02:44,359
We've got girls as well.

474
01:02:44,409 --> 01:02:51,192
"Gogol's street."
"Maksim Gorj-jiki"... "Gorjiki street."

475
01:02:52,367 --> 01:02:55,026
Lenin's hill.

476
01:02:56,617 --> 01:03:00,442
Hey, Aleksi!
- Hey!

477
01:03:03,034 --> 01:03:07,442
Aleksi, down with the Russki.
- Down with the Russki, Finland good!

478
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:11,151
Say again: down with the Russki.
- Down with the Russki.

479
01:03:11,201 --> 01:03:13,859
Say it again.
- Down with the Russki.

480
01:03:13,909 --> 01:03:15,526
Tanja...

481
01:03:21,117 --> 01:03:26,109
Aleksi, down with the Russki!
- Down with the Russki, Finland good!

482
01:03:31,909 --> 01:03:34,609
Hello.
- Hello.

483
01:03:35,784 --> 01:03:37,984
Come inside.

484
01:03:39,492 --> 01:03:41,526
Here again.

485
01:03:41,576 --> 01:03:45,734
Did you bring that tea?
- Tea and chai.

486
01:03:45,784 --> 01:03:47,859
We've got music.

487
01:03:47,909 --> 01:03:50,609
A disc.

488
01:04:07,117 --> 01:04:09,317
Spasiba.

489
01:04:32,617 --> 01:04:35,401
What are you grieving, Veerukka?

490
01:04:36,492 --> 01:04:40,151
Don't talk. She misses her fiancé.

491
01:04:40,201 --> 01:04:43,359
Veruka doesn't have a fiancé.

492
01:04:47,076 --> 01:04:53,234
Why did you come?
Why didn't you leave us be at peace?

493
01:04:53,284 --> 01:04:56,234
You started this.

494
01:04:56,284 --> 01:05:01,109
You took my farm. Go look
at the state of the Isthmus.

495
01:05:01,159 --> 01:05:05,192
We wouldn't be here if you had left us alone.
- Oh, look at that!

496
01:05:05,242 --> 01:05:07,942
Who came? Hitler!

497
01:05:11,076 --> 01:05:13,651
But he'll be met with death.

498
01:05:14,617 --> 01:05:18,692
Then why did you aim your rifle at me?

499
01:05:20,242 --> 01:05:23,317
How could I know who was coming?

500
01:05:24,034 --> 01:05:29,442
I confess, war is pure evil, on both sides.

501
01:05:29,492 --> 01:05:35,276
No matter who starts it.
Everyone has to suffer...

502
01:05:38,659 --> 01:05:43,859
...even those who haven't hurt anybody.
Like kids for example.

503
01:05:49,242 --> 01:05:52,359
You said we're evildoers.

504
01:05:52,409 --> 01:05:57,317
But Hietanen brought our tomorrow's
bread ration for Aleksi and Tanja.

505
01:06:25,451 --> 01:06:29,609
Our boys are sharing their
own rations with the children -

506
01:06:29,659 --> 01:06:36,151
of the kindred nations, who have been
suffering from hunger under Bolshevik rule.

507
01:06:38,034 --> 01:06:45,234
<i>You don't give to children. You eat everything yourself,
as you're such a young fat man.</i>

508
01:07:01,784 --> 01:07:04,526
(Vanhala) Music...

509
01:07:13,284 --> 01:07:17,234
Stalin's speeches. Stalin...

510
01:07:20,534 --> 01:07:23,234
Should we?

511
01:07:31,951 --> 01:07:38,067
Kalinka, kalinka, kalinka moja

512
01:07:41,451 --> 01:07:47,567
Sadu jagoda malinka, malinka moja

513
01:07:49,867 --> 01:07:56,067
Kalinka, kalinka, kalinka moja

514
01:07:56,117 --> 01:08:01,401
Sadu jagoda malinka, malinka moja

515
01:08:01,451 --> 01:08:06,151
(All women together)
Kalinka, kalinka, kalinka moja

516
01:08:06,201 --> 01:08:10,442
Sadu jagoda malinka, malinka moja

517
01:08:10,492 --> 01:08:14,776
Kalinka, kalinka, kalinka moja

518
01:08:30,367 --> 01:08:33,442
I guess I can keep this,
for memory's sake.

519
01:08:35,117 --> 01:08:37,526
Take it.

520
01:09:02,992 --> 01:09:07,859
You should've stayed.
Finnish tribes could've united.

521
01:09:07,909 --> 01:09:11,734
We can't take Hietanen there anymore.
He'll get a wound in his heart.

522
01:09:11,784 --> 01:09:16,234
Don't think I'll be the first one to thaw.
- We're just joking.

523
01:09:16,284 --> 01:09:21,484
I'm a regular sorrowless fellow.
I don't care about anything.

524
01:09:25,659 --> 01:09:29,151
(Sinkkonen) Perfect cleanliness has
to be maintained.

525
01:09:29,201 --> 01:09:33,192
Barracks regulations, with all its clauses,
is in effect.

526
01:09:33,242 --> 01:09:37,359
NCOs will lodge separately
in their own quarters.

527
01:09:37,409 --> 01:09:40,401
Your job is to oversee that
good order is maintained.

528
01:09:40,451 --> 01:09:45,359
That's not fine by me. Paw and I take our tea
together, and everything else as well.

529
01:09:45,409 --> 01:09:49,526
I'll bunk with him,
or maybe Paw will lodge in the NCO quarters.

530
01:09:49,576 --> 01:09:53,567
Be quiet. You'll go
where you're ordered.

531
01:09:53,617 --> 01:10:01,151
Is that clear? - Well, no. Don't try
to flaunt yourself, you know how that'll end for you.

532
01:10:01,201 --> 01:10:06,234
Do you fucking horseman think that
I'll jump according to your whims like recruit?

533
01:10:06,284 --> 01:10:08,776
Attention!

534
01:10:10,617 --> 01:10:12,484
At ease.

535
01:10:13,867 --> 01:10:17,026
Corporal Rokka.
- What's the matter?

536
01:10:17,076 --> 01:10:21,359
You'll stay in the NCO quarters like everyone else.
Is that clear? - We'll see about that later.

537
01:10:21,409 --> 01:10:26,692
That's not something I want to argue about.
But when will we start getting furloughs?

538
01:10:26,742 --> 01:10:31,151
I'm a family man and we've been here for months.
If I leave an application, will you approve it?

539
01:10:31,201 --> 01:10:36,151
We're not on a first name basis.
- Well sure, but let's be.

540
01:10:36,201 --> 01:10:38,734
I'm Antero. You can call me that anytime you like.

541
01:10:38,784 --> 01:10:42,651
And I'll address you informally in any case,
since you're younger than me.

542
01:10:49,784 --> 01:10:52,442
Attention!

543
01:10:52,492 --> 01:10:55,901
I discipline Corporal Rokka
for disobeying a superior officer -

544
01:10:55,951 --> 01:10:58,484
with four days of labor without relief.

545
01:10:58,534 --> 01:11:02,151
The punished will carry out
four extra guard duty shifts.

546
01:11:07,242 --> 01:11:09,484
At ease.

547
01:11:11,534 --> 01:11:16,234
(Hietanen sings)
So once sang black Saara...

548
01:11:16,284 --> 01:11:20,484
little happy nigger child...

549
01:11:22,326 --> 01:11:25,484
In Heaven the Lord will relieve
you of your pain...

550
01:12:35,909 --> 01:12:40,067
Company, get ready! We're moving out!
- No we aren't.

551
01:12:40,117 --> 01:12:42,609
Company, get up!

552
01:12:44,742 --> 01:12:49,026
For the last time, get ready.

553
01:12:49,076 --> 01:12:54,859
Koskela for company commander.
- Koskela for company commander. Then we'll go.

554
01:12:59,784 --> 01:13:02,067
This is not some Red Guard -

555
01:13:02,117 --> 01:13:07,817
that elects its company commanders
by shouting out votes. Is that clear? - No.

556
01:13:10,576 --> 01:13:15,526
I am ordering you for the last time.
After that, other measures will be taken.

557
01:13:22,326 --> 01:13:26,151
I think there's reason to hurry up.

558
01:13:27,492 --> 01:13:30,567
Don't take too much extra junk.

559
01:13:30,617 --> 01:13:35,859
Sure, musical instruments are nice. I guess
we'll manage with them somehow.

560
01:13:38,992 --> 01:13:42,484
Where are they taking us?
- To Svir river.

561
01:13:42,534 --> 01:13:46,901
What the hell?
- Why couldn't we stay?

562
01:13:46,951 --> 01:13:49,526
To Svir?
- Tighten up a bit.

563
01:13:50,992 --> 01:13:54,151
Fucking go.
- Go ahead, quickly.

564
01:13:54,201 --> 01:13:56,817
(Hietanen) I made it!

565
01:13:58,617 --> 01:14:02,067
Goddamn, where are we going?

566
01:15:05,159 --> 01:15:11,776
Private Korhonen and Private Peltola
had during the 3rd day of this month -

567
01:15:11,826 --> 01:15:19,442
in the enemy's vicinity,
refused to obey their superior's orders.

568
01:15:21,242 --> 01:15:27,651
A military tribunal has sentenced
Private Korhonen and Private Peltola, -

569
01:15:27,701 --> 01:15:33,067
to suffer the death penalty
for these crimes.

570
01:15:37,992 --> 01:15:40,026
Load!

571
01:15:43,867 --> 01:15:45,651
Aim!

572
01:15:48,367 --> 01:15:50,401
Fire!

573
01:16:03,909 --> 01:16:06,026
Right...

574
01:16:06,076 --> 01:16:11,901
The sentence has been carried out,
so that insubordinates will see -

575
01:16:11,951 --> 01:16:15,526
that this army doesn't have time for games.

576
01:16:16,659 --> 01:16:19,901
I hope, and I believe -

577
01:16:19,951 --> 01:16:26,192
that I won't have to read out
something like this again in this battalion.

578
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:58,000
SVIR
January 1942

579
01:17:14,201 --> 01:17:17,901
Alarm!
Enemy ahead!

580
01:17:41,076 --> 01:17:43,567
Who's there?

581
01:17:44,534 --> 01:17:49,526
What do you think?
Who might it be?

582
01:17:51,367 --> 01:17:57,442
We're toast. If we have to flee,
the machine gun better not get left behind.

583
01:17:59,701 --> 01:18:02,651
Sure, I'll take the gun-stand.

584
01:18:06,534 --> 01:18:10,109
(Lahtinen)
Meet you back on the tanner's rafters.

585
01:18:19,201 --> 01:18:23,901
Stay put! Get back!
Who the fuck told you to fall back?

586
01:18:23,951 --> 01:18:27,901
They're running! We'd better go, too!
- Back to the line!

587
01:18:27,951 --> 01:18:30,901
Not before the others! Sihvonen!

588
01:18:32,826 --> 01:18:36,401
Hentinen is dead!
- Perkele!

589
01:18:38,826 --> 01:18:42,859
Määttä! Go help!
I'll hold them off for a while.

590
01:18:44,742 --> 01:18:46,234
Pull, pull!

591
01:18:47,284 --> 01:18:49,234
Pull, pull!

592
01:18:53,326 --> 01:18:56,942
Lahtinen!
- Leave the machine gun!

593
01:19:07,326 --> 01:19:09,484
Perkele!

594
01:19:35,034 --> 01:19:39,942
Fucking sheep! You run off like cowards
and leave the wounded!

595
01:19:39,992 --> 01:19:47,067
Where's Lahtinen and the machine gun?
They're lying back there. Side by side.

596
01:19:48,159 --> 01:19:52,651
Nothing to be done about it. This man did what he could.
No reason to blame him.

597
01:19:52,701 --> 01:19:58,026
I'm not looking for anyone to blame.
Lahtinen and his machine gun is what I was looking for.

598
01:19:59,326 --> 01:20:02,526
Let's put our line back together.
They'll be here soon.

599
01:20:09,909 --> 01:20:16,359
Listen, 2nd Lieutenant. Where do you need a real top-notch fella?
'Cause you've got one here.

600
01:20:18,367 --> 01:20:23,359
Ends of the line are the worst.
Go secure our left flank and keep an eye on the situation.

601
01:20:23,409 --> 01:20:27,609
Sihvonen, come with me.
Paw, give him your skis.

602
01:20:30,117 --> 01:20:34,026
You're going to have so much fun with me!

603
01:20:41,742 --> 01:20:45,192
Goddamn, what a ploy.

604
01:20:48,159 --> 01:20:53,526
They sent troops to flank us.
Some damn instinct I've got.

605
01:21:18,659 --> 01:21:20,692
Come on now.

606
01:21:22,117 --> 01:21:24,734
What's taking you so long?

607
01:21:38,659 --> 01:21:42,067
There's full magazines in the pack.

608
01:21:43,534 --> 01:21:47,026
As I empty them,
you refill them.

609
01:21:47,076 --> 01:21:50,359
Keep the full ones in one pile,
so they don't get mixed.

610
01:21:50,409 --> 01:21:53,192
Be calm. Just like me.

611
01:21:53,242 --> 01:21:58,317
We're in no trouble here.
They're about to have it rough, and not us.

612
01:21:59,576 --> 01:22:04,526
If you can sing, then hum by yourself.
That keeps the mind at ease.

613
01:22:04,576 --> 01:22:09,359
Think about all kinds of crazy stuff,
they're good in a spot like this.

614
01:22:09,409 --> 01:22:12,817
Little strategy for the mind.

615
01:22:16,534 --> 01:22:18,942
Officer in front.

616
01:22:18,992 --> 01:22:24,567
When his head's shadow hits that small spruce,
he'll meet his maker.

617
01:22:24,617 --> 01:22:29,859
That's how I've decided for him.
And after that, the others will start getting it as well.

618
01:22:29,909 --> 01:22:32,734
They don't know what awaits them.

619
01:22:32,784 --> 01:22:36,442
Soon you'll see how the Lord calls for His own.

620
01:22:37,326 --> 01:22:42,067
If they have sinned, then,
Lord, forgive them.

621
01:22:42,117 --> 01:22:46,317
But be quick about it,
they'll start coming real soon.

622
01:23:59,659 --> 01:24:02,484
Where are you going?
- Nowhere.

623
01:24:02,534 --> 01:24:06,401
Back to your post then.
Magazines are getting empty.

624
01:24:11,409 --> 01:24:17,609
It was that devil, behind that small spruce!
You don't fucking cross Antti Rokka!

625
01:24:18,617 --> 01:24:20,651
Goddamn!

626
01:24:22,701 --> 01:24:25,567
Perkele!

627
01:25:31,659 --> 01:25:34,651
Dad's coming home!

628
01:25:37,784 --> 01:25:40,401
Dad, dad!

629
01:25:42,617 --> 01:25:45,276
(Rokka) Well, well? I'm back home for a week.

630
01:25:45,326 --> 01:25:48,359
(Lyyti) We've been waiting for you.

631
01:25:49,117 --> 01:25:54,526
Oh, you smell of something horrible.
- Dad, don't go to war again.

632
01:25:54,576 --> 01:25:59,692
It's good that you came. The horse needs to be shod
and we need a new load of wood.

633
01:26:00,451 --> 01:26:04,317
Well then, it has to be done.
- We'll go inside.

634
01:26:45,409 --> 01:26:48,234
Get your spirits up, hmh?

635
01:27:09,201 --> 01:27:13,776
Dad, we're making Finland Great.
- You think so?

636
01:27:13,826 --> 01:27:16,234
What you got there?

637
01:27:16,284 --> 01:27:20,401
(Lyyti) Do you need to bother
an old man like that anymore?

638
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:32,000
4th of June 1942

639
01:27:33,034 --> 01:27:36,651
<i>The Marshal of Finland's 75th birthday -</i>

640
01:27:36,701 --> 01:27:41,984
<i>turned out to be the grandest and
most unforgettable celebration in Finland's history.</i>

641
01:27:42,034 --> 01:27:45,984
<i>The celebration's culmination was when
the leader of Greater Germany, Adolf Hitler -</i>

642
01:27:46,034 --> 01:27:50,234
<i>personally arrived to congratulate
the Marshal of Finland -</i>

643
01:27:50,284 --> 01:27:54,026
<i>on his and the Reich's behalf.</i>

644
01:28:01,159 --> 01:28:02,984
Here you are.

645
01:28:03,034 --> 01:28:06,109
Cut cognac.
- Cut.

646
01:28:06,159 --> 01:28:10,359
Mannerheim's liquor.
- Well, cheers.

647
01:28:10,409 --> 01:28:14,234
Drink it with good luck.
- With good luck.

648
01:28:16,034 --> 01:28:20,151
This is nothing. Get the Boy.
- Go get the Boy!

649
01:28:20,951 --> 01:28:24,442
All right, hooch!

650
01:28:35,284 --> 01:28:41,484
But Ville, maybe I ain't the best, but I've
still done pretty good. Haven't I?

651
01:28:41,534 --> 01:28:45,109
Tough lads.
- I'm off to the village.

652
01:28:45,159 --> 01:28:49,776
Across Svir? How will you manage that?
- There's women there, building roads.

653
01:28:49,826 --> 01:28:53,734
What do you say, boss?
- A man goes and a man comes.

654
01:28:54,742 --> 01:29:00,026
We're leaving tomorrow. If you want to go AWOL,
that's none of my business.

655
01:29:00,076 --> 01:29:04,401
The things we have to do, we do.
Otherwise, you can do as you please.

656
01:29:04,451 --> 01:29:08,609
You can go, as long as you remember that.
- I'll be here if I'm alive.

657
01:29:08,659 --> 01:29:11,192
(Rokka) What the hell are you doing with that blanket?

658
01:29:11,242 --> 01:29:14,359
Well, one needs a bed.
Who the hell lies on bare ground?

659
01:29:14,409 --> 01:29:18,567
I think he'll succeed. He'll get
through this war without a scratch.

660
01:29:18,617 --> 01:29:22,817
Too crooked a man for even a bullet to hit.
- I'm just saying.

661
01:29:23,826 --> 01:29:26,984
And I mean no offense.

662
01:29:27,034 --> 01:29:32,151
but Rahikainen hasn't exactly
put himself on harm's way that often.

663
01:29:32,201 --> 01:29:36,651
I don't know about that,
but I guess every man is scared.

664
01:29:37,826 --> 01:29:42,026
There's no man who isn't
scared of death.

665
01:29:42,951 --> 01:29:46,984
("Kalinka" playing on the gramophone)

666
01:29:52,909 --> 01:29:56,317
Jokkatii, jokkatii, jokkatii, jokkatii,
jokkatii, kamaja

667
01:29:57,992 --> 01:30:02,942
Hietanen, dance.
Hostess of the bunker is dancing now.

668
01:30:26,159 --> 01:30:30,651
The poor Finnish people
is breaking its chains

669
01:30:30,701 --> 01:30:35,067
The chalice of suffering is filled to the brim

670
01:30:35,117 --> 01:30:40,401
Goddamn, songs of the Rebellion!
- Let him sing!

671
01:30:40,451 --> 01:30:44,484
The best sons of the noble people to the battle.

672
01:30:44,534 --> 01:30:49,401
The poor Finnish people
is breaking its chains

673
01:30:49,451 --> 01:30:53,984
The chalice of suffering is filled to the brim

674
01:30:54,034 --> 01:30:56,901
I'm an aircraft!

675
01:30:56,951 --> 01:31:01,442
An emblem of the Soviet Republic.
Boys, look!

676
01:31:07,076 --> 01:31:10,109
Hietanen, the plane is going down!

677
01:31:10,159 --> 01:31:14,776
(Rokka) Koskela, where are you going?
- To Jerusalem.

678
01:31:29,284 --> 01:31:31,484
Mielonen.

679
01:31:33,659 --> 01:31:38,609
Mielonen, perkele.
What kind of a doorman are you?

680
01:31:40,326 --> 01:31:43,026
(Singing together: "Die Fahne hoch")

681
01:31:43,076 --> 01:31:47,317
Marschier'n im Geist
In unser'n Reihen mit

682
01:31:47,367 --> 01:31:52,151
Kam'raden die Rot geschlossen

683
01:31:52,201 --> 01:31:57,359
SA marschiert
mit ruhig festem Schritt

684
01:31:58,534 --> 01:32:03,734
Splendid is death, when courageous,
the first in battle, thou fallest,

685
01:32:03,784 --> 01:32:09,234
Fallest in war for thy land,
dying for city and home.

686
01:32:09,284 --> 01:32:14,526
Therefore, with fiery mind,
arise to fight for thy country,

687
01:32:14,576 --> 01:32:19,942
Hasten to yield up thy life,
gladly, for races to come!

688
01:32:19,992 --> 01:32:24,901
This behoves, above all,
a youth while still he is wearing

689
01:32:24,951 --> 01:32:30,026
Wreaths on the curls of his head,
sweet-scented flowers of spring.

690
01:32:30,076 --> 01:32:38,026
Handsome to women, stately to men,
he may seem in his life-time;

691
01:32:38,076 --> 01:32:42,067
Handsomer is he in death,
fall’n in the thick of the fray.

692
01:32:48,284 --> 01:32:52,484
An officer's toast. Gentlemen.

693
01:32:54,201 --> 01:32:57,651
Forth without hesitation,
where the Marshal's sword points.

694
01:33:01,617 --> 01:33:04,484
Hey, Ville. Old pal!

695
01:33:04,534 --> 01:33:07,609
Die Fahne hoch

696
01:33:07,659 --> 01:33:11,734
Die Reihen fest geschlossen...
- Rastui!

697
01:33:16,742 --> 01:33:21,692
Siperia, polsoi, taika. Topra huja!

698
01:33:21,742 --> 01:33:24,942
(Kitunen) Who's talking Russki?

699
01:33:24,992 --> 01:33:27,692
Koskela from Finland.

700
01:33:27,742 --> 01:33:31,151
Eats iron and shits chains.

701
01:33:32,117 --> 01:33:36,567
Do you have something against me?
- Socialist-tis-tis...

702
01:33:36,617 --> 01:33:41,401
I can speak Finnish too. Might be best
for you to stick with it as well.

703
01:33:41,451 --> 01:33:48,026
Gu...gu...gun...
Shot coming...

704
01:33:48,076 --> 01:33:51,984
Bear hunter Martti Kitunen.

705
01:33:53,034 --> 01:33:56,317
Riti rati ralla

706
01:33:56,367 --> 01:34:00,859
winter's frost came

707
01:34:00,909 --> 01:34:05,317
hoary-beard, blizzard-hair

708
01:34:05,367 --> 01:34:09,692
snow-cloak, gray-sock

709
01:34:12,326 --> 01:34:16,901
Perkele, I'm shifting to second gear!

710
01:34:16,951 --> 01:34:19,984
Ville, calm down!

711
01:34:20,451 --> 01:34:26,317
(Koskela) Perkele! You don't dance humppa like this!
- Calm down!

712
01:34:26,367 --> 01:34:29,859
What's...what's...what's up guys?

713
01:34:29,909 --> 01:34:33,776
(Koskela sings)
I found a girl from Karelia

714
01:34:33,826 --> 01:34:38,359
found a little cute thing.

715
01:34:43,034 --> 01:34:45,526
Ville, calm down.

716
01:34:47,034 --> 01:34:49,026
Ville!

717
01:34:50,909 --> 01:34:53,067
Take it easy!

718
01:34:53,534 --> 01:34:58,192
(Koskela) Cold, it's cold, boys...

719
01:35:01,826 --> 01:35:08,317
Two coffins at the same time.
My brothers are gone...

720
01:35:08,367 --> 01:35:10,609
Hot.

721
01:35:12,076 --> 01:35:15,484
Try to get him to sleep.
- Old solo warrior.

722
01:35:15,534 --> 01:35:18,734
Beautiful, very beautiful.

723
01:35:20,784 --> 01:35:23,026
What have you been drinking here?

724
01:35:24,659 --> 01:35:27,109
Hooch.

725
01:35:27,159 --> 01:35:32,692
You will be responsible for this half-squad,
until Koskela and Hietala...

726
01:35:34,242 --> 01:35:38,817
...Hietanen...sober up.

727
01:35:45,659 --> 01:35:47,734
Hello.

728
01:35:47,784 --> 01:35:51,692
Hello, old solo warrior.

729
01:35:51,742 --> 01:35:56,526
Take him to bed.
- That we'll do.

730
01:35:56,576 --> 01:36:00,401
Try at least.
- We'll try.

731
01:36:02,534 --> 01:36:04,817
We're home.

732
01:36:16,992 --> 01:36:19,359
Old grandpa, what's new?

733
01:36:22,451 --> 01:36:25,401
Go home.

734
01:36:25,451 --> 01:36:28,817
But don't you dare come back.

735
01:37:24,034 --> 01:37:27,026
Is this Lieutenant Koskela's bunker?

736
01:37:28,201 --> 01:37:32,692
It is. - Is the Lieutenant
Lieutenant Koskela himself?

737
01:37:32,742 --> 01:37:36,276
Yes.
- Lieutenant, might I have a word?

738
01:37:36,326 --> 01:37:39,359
Don’t see why not.

739
01:37:39,409 --> 01:37:42,609
Private Honkajoki A, A1 -

740
01:37:42,659 --> 01:37:48,192
first A is short for Aarne,
second A and 1 denotes my fitness grade -

741
01:37:48,242 --> 01:37:51,984
reports to the Lieutenant's
platoon as a replacement.

742
01:37:52,034 --> 01:37:54,692
Served before in
the 50th infantry regiment's -

743
01:37:54,742 --> 01:37:56,776
2nd machine gun company -

744
01:37:56,826 --> 01:38:01,484
after being wounded, was reassigned here
by the Personnel Replenishment Center -

745
01:38:01,534 --> 01:38:07,651
Hereby reporting for active military duty,
firmly prepared to sacrifice my own blood -

746
01:38:07,701 --> 01:38:13,942
and the blood I received at the hospital,
for the Fatherland and for the freedom of our people.

747
01:38:25,909 --> 01:38:31,651
Well, welcome then.
Two others to the other half-squad.

748
01:38:37,992 --> 01:38:42,317
I guess you don't trust foreign weapons?

749
01:38:42,367 --> 01:38:47,651
In light of the rapid development of weaponry and technical
equipment that is currently in use in this great war -

750
01:38:47,701 --> 01:38:52,901
I find that from the point of view of the nation’s defense,
the adoption of new weapons is essential.

751
01:38:52,951 --> 01:38:57,151
What did you do for work?
- Forestry is my livelihood.

752
01:38:57,201 --> 01:39:01,192
More specifically,
collecting pine cones.

753
01:39:02,701 --> 01:39:06,401
I am an inventor.
My most immediate goal is a perpetual motion machine.

754
01:39:06,451 --> 01:39:12,442
No one can invent such a thing.
- Well, maybe I'll rest a bit.

755
01:39:16,117 --> 01:39:19,859
Well. What's your name and age group?

756
01:39:19,909 --> 01:39:25,192
Private Hauhia, Lieutenant.
I just turned 19, Lieutenant.

757
01:39:25,242 --> 01:39:30,776
Rokka. Take the boy with you the next time
you go on guard, show him the ropes.

758
01:39:33,826 --> 01:39:35,859
Anything to ask?

759
01:39:36,826 --> 01:39:39,317
No, Lieutenant.

760
01:39:41,742 --> 01:39:44,151
We're not in the habit of formally addressing folks here.

761
01:39:44,201 --> 01:39:47,359
This of course only applies to me,
other officers are a different case.

762
01:39:47,409 --> 01:39:49,984
Yes, Lieutenant.

763
01:39:51,742 --> 01:39:55,192
All right. You'll figure it out.

764
01:40:03,201 --> 01:40:08,651
I've been in an air raid,
but that's nothing compared to real war.

765
01:40:08,701 --> 01:40:14,317
There's no more real war than that.
This is the outhouse.

766
01:40:14,367 --> 01:40:19,776
Are those flyers?
- Yes. They even provide us with toiler paper.

767
01:40:19,826 --> 01:40:25,359
Have you lost many men?
- Every few days some guy kicks the bucket. Go!

768
01:40:25,409 --> 01:40:29,276
All right, come now,
so your elder can teach you to fight.

769
01:40:30,326 --> 01:40:33,109
Never go out alone,
remember that.

770
01:40:34,117 --> 01:40:37,526
<i>(Russian megaphone)
Soldiers, don't believe your officers...</i>

771
01:40:37,576 --> 01:40:42,859
Positions for riflemen.
This is their guard. You see anything?

772
01:40:42,909 --> 01:40:47,109
<i>Your officers are your archenemies!</i>

773
01:40:49,034 --> 01:40:51,901
Don't read while on guard duty,
even if that Ukkola is doing it.

774
01:40:51,951 --> 01:40:56,942
Get this through your skull:
never raise your head from the trench.

775
01:40:56,992 --> 01:41:01,484
Almost everyone who has died
held their head too high for an extra second.

776
01:41:01,534 --> 01:41:07,109
Just look through the periscope.
You see? Like so?

777
01:41:07,159 --> 01:41:10,734
<i>(Russian megaphone) Kill your Lapuan officers
and come over!</i>

778
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:15,109
Lapuans have been killed way back already!

779
01:41:15,159 --> 01:41:18,609
Now it's the Laihians' turn!

780
01:41:18,659 --> 01:41:22,567
<i>Sons of Finland! Come get some bread!</i>

781
01:41:22,617 --> 01:41:25,651
You come and get some butter for your bread!

782
01:41:25,701 --> 01:41:30,401
<i>He does that damn thing all the time.
- Finnish working class soldiers!</i>

783
01:41:30,451 --> 01:41:33,776
<i>You must shed your blood while -</i>

784
01:41:33,826 --> 01:41:38,026
<i>the Germans are raping your wives and sisters!</i>

785
01:41:38,076 --> 01:41:43,734
Yes, and the mothers of the younger ones
are getting what they badly need!

786
01:41:45,326 --> 01:41:51,192
Vanhala, don't you keep yelling here.
- They started it.

787
01:41:58,909 --> 01:42:03,359
There's 14 dead there.
Remember their places.

788
01:42:03,409 --> 01:42:06,734
If they come,
don't mix the living with the dead.

789
01:42:06,784 --> 01:42:10,567
Right, take a look yourself.

790
01:42:10,617 --> 01:42:15,484
Like that.
Remember to keep your head down -

791
01:42:16,534 --> 01:42:18,484
Just like that.

792
01:42:19,326 --> 01:42:24,776
If they come, pull from this wire.
It goes to the bunker.

793
01:42:25,534 --> 01:42:28,901
Remember to keep your head down.
- Yes.

794
01:42:36,492 --> 01:42:39,609
What's it like to shoot at another human being?

795
01:42:40,742 --> 01:42:44,317
I don't know,
I've only been shooting at enemies.

796
01:42:45,201 --> 01:42:50,026
Are they not human at all?
- No, they're not.

797
01:42:50,076 --> 01:42:55,734
I don't know. The wise say so –
that an enemy is not human.

798
01:42:55,784 --> 01:42:58,026
I don't think about such things.

799
01:42:58,076 --> 01:43:02,442
Antti Rokka just shoots and
makes rings. You do that as well.

800
01:43:02,492 --> 01:43:06,942
(Rahikainen sings)
As our way headed for battles

801
01:43:06,992 --> 01:43:11,359
Where only the song of the bullets played,

802
01:43:11,409 --> 01:43:15,026
We never knew as we departed...

803
01:43:16,326 --> 01:43:18,526
Alarm!

804
01:43:27,326 --> 01:43:30,776
(Koskela) Salo and Sihvonen,
take the boy away. - Right.

805
01:43:32,076 --> 01:43:35,276
You can't say that the boy wasn't told.

806
01:44:13,951 --> 01:44:18,817
"Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host
appeared with the angel, -

807
01:44:18,867 --> 01:44:21,942
praising God and saying:

808
01:44:21,992 --> 01:44:28,401
“Glory to God in the highest heaven,
and on earth peace to those -

809
01:44:28,451 --> 01:44:31,901
on whom his favor rests.”

810
01:44:33,659 --> 01:44:39,192
Merry Christmas, soldiers.
- Merry Christmas, Major!

811
01:44:45,326 --> 01:44:49,442
Fair is creation,

812
01:44:49,492 --> 01:44:53,567
Fairer God’s heaven,

813
01:44:53,617 --> 01:45:01,609
Blest is the marching pilgrim throng.

814
01:45:01,659 --> 01:45:05,901
Onward through lovely
Regions of beauty

815
01:45:05,951 --> 01:45:09,526
Go we to Paradise

816
01:45:09,576 --> 01:45:16,567
with song.

817
01:45:21,576 --> 01:45:26,192
Ages are coming,

818
01:45:26,242 --> 01:45:30,734
Ages are passing

819
01:45:30,784 --> 01:45:38,317
Nations arise and disappear.

820
01:45:39,451 --> 01:45:43,942
Never the joyful

821
01:45:43,992 --> 01:45:48,151
Message from heaven

822
01:45:48,201 --> 01:45:54,276
Wanes through the soul’s brief sojourn here.

823
01:45:58,242 --> 01:46:00,651
Merry Christmas then.

824
01:46:03,867 --> 01:46:06,317
Merry Christmas.

825
01:46:06,992 --> 01:46:11,526
(Sarastie)
Fleeting is life in this earthly frame.

826
01:46:14,284 --> 01:46:17,442
Let us, then, burn with a roaring flame,

827
01:46:17,492 --> 01:46:21,401
in fire let’s soar on a heaven-bound road.

828
01:46:25,159 --> 01:46:28,359
Dust to dust,

829
01:46:28,409 --> 01:46:32,526
but heaven is spirit’s abode.

830
01:46:55,367 --> 01:47:00,901
<i>Soldiers,
don't believe your officers' lies!</i>

831
01:47:00,951 --> 01:47:05,276
<i>Your officers are your archenemies!</i>

832
01:47:05,277 --> 01:47:09,277
SVIR
July 1943

833
01:47:14,534 --> 01:47:18,609
What's this?
What sort of a man are you?

834
01:47:19,367 --> 01:47:24,234
I'm a guard. And a guard is someone
you shouldn't rumble at.

835
01:47:24,284 --> 01:47:27,026
As he has been entrusted with great powers.

836
01:47:27,076 --> 01:47:30,276
What are you doing?
- I'm carving a lamp-stand, can't you see?

837
01:47:30,326 --> 01:47:35,192
This is looking a bit like it already.
This is going to be a lamp-stand like no other.

838
01:47:35,242 --> 01:47:39,651
Don't you understand you're on guard duty?
- Of course, why else would I be here?

839
01:47:39,701 --> 01:47:45,817
You can see yourself that I'm a guard,
as I'm looking through the periscope all the time.

840
01:47:47,909 --> 01:47:50,026
What's your name?

841
01:47:50,076 --> 01:47:53,609
Right. I'll relay the order. Out.

842
01:47:55,409 --> 01:47:58,609
Rokka. It was Lammio.

843
01:47:59,951 --> 01:48:04,151
He commanded you to clean
the command post's surroundings.

844
01:48:08,242 --> 01:48:12,276
The paths should be decorated with round stones.

845
01:48:16,076 --> 01:48:21,359
(Vanhala) Round stones...
(Koskela) - So you're not going?

846
01:48:36,784 --> 01:48:39,651
Evening.

847
01:48:43,992 --> 01:48:49,567
Goddammit. Me cleaning your lawn
and decorating your paths with stones.

848
01:48:49,617 --> 01:48:53,734
I chose that assignment to see
whether you'll obey or not.

849
01:48:53,784 --> 01:48:57,567
You think I'll obey?
- I'd suggest you do.

850
01:48:58,492 --> 01:49:00,984
You think I'm afraid?

851
01:49:08,534 --> 01:49:11,317
Not at all.

852
01:49:17,201 --> 01:49:20,442
If you behaved like a soldier -

853
01:49:20,492 --> 01:49:23,151
especially in front
of a superior officer -

854
01:49:23,201 --> 01:49:27,151
I could straight up promise
you the Mannerheim Cross.

855
01:49:27,201 --> 01:49:30,609
I'd offer you a smoke.

856
01:49:30,659 --> 01:49:35,484
You're the best fighter I know.
- That I am.

857
01:49:35,534 --> 01:49:41,276
But don't let that illusion continue,
that because of that, everything is forgiven.

858
01:49:41,826 --> 01:49:47,192
By completing the task I gave you,
you have a chance to make everything right.

859
01:49:51,826 --> 01:49:56,109
You know what?
I'm not doing it.

860
01:49:56,159 --> 01:50:01,192
That means court martial.
- That means a whole fucking lot else too!

861
01:50:01,242 --> 01:50:04,317
Don't you fella
try playing with me.

862
01:50:04,367 --> 01:50:08,859
My pregnant old lady is cutting down rye
all by herself in the Isthmus -

863
01:50:08,909 --> 01:50:10,817
and you goddamn idiot -

864
01:50:10,867 --> 01:50:14,942
try to make me lay
stones on the sides of your paths!

865
01:50:14,992 --> 01:50:19,151
I'm not going to do that!
You believe me?

866
01:50:25,034 --> 01:50:28,359
Of war, I know what needs to be known,
but I'm not here to play.

867
01:50:28,409 --> 01:50:33,317
Court martial me if you wish,
but I'll not die like a dog.

868
01:50:33,367 --> 01:50:37,317
A few guys will meet their demise before that.
Get that through your skull.

869
01:50:43,451 --> 01:50:45,859
Who is it?

870
01:50:46,534 --> 01:50:48,734
Who's there?

871
01:50:51,617 --> 01:50:54,609
Don't go anywhere.

872
01:50:54,659 --> 01:50:57,151
Just calmly stay there.

873
01:50:57,867 --> 01:50:59,651
Don't go anywhere.

874
01:51:18,451 --> 01:51:21,276
Go get some sleep.

875
01:51:51,492 --> 01:51:55,651
Just us.
- Well, all right then.

876
01:51:57,076 --> 01:52:02,651
Want a smoke? - I don't smoke.
You shouldn't either, it's a hell of a poison.

877
01:53:10,326 --> 01:53:12,401
Alarm, alarm!

878
01:53:47,034 --> 01:53:52,609
Get up. We had a small
wrestling match here.

879
01:53:52,659 --> 01:53:55,317
Goddamn.

880
01:53:55,367 --> 01:53:57,942
(Question in Russian)

881
01:53:58,867 --> 01:54:01,067
Baranov.

882
01:54:01,117 --> 01:54:04,067
(Question in Russian)

883
01:54:06,284 --> 01:54:10,067
(Answer in Russian)

884
01:54:10,117 --> 01:54:15,401
What did he say? - They were meant to take a prisoner,
but that didn't work out.

885
01:54:22,284 --> 01:54:24,359
Captain.
- Ville...

886
01:54:24,409 --> 01:54:26,609
A Captain, this lad.
- He's a a big shot.

887
01:54:26,659 --> 01:54:31,859
Don't call this in yet, Ville. They've
promised a furlough for taking a prisoner.

888
01:54:31,909 --> 01:54:35,567
Vanhala!
Turn on the gramophone!

889
01:54:38,826 --> 01:54:41,026
("Kalinka" plays)

890
01:55:01,201 --> 01:55:06,484
Cheer up. We'll go to prison together,
we'll have no worries there.

891
01:55:06,534 --> 01:55:10,692
We'll carve lamp-stands.
I'll show you how it's done.

892
01:55:10,742 --> 01:55:15,776
Who's this?
- Him? He's the Baranov boy.

893
01:55:15,826 --> 01:55:21,817
The Baranov boy? - Since we're doing this inquiry,
I thought we might get his over with too.

894
01:55:21,867 --> 01:55:25,859
How did you get the prisoner?
- They tried to take me to Russia.

895
01:55:25,909 --> 01:55:29,942
I told them that's not going to work out,
since I gotta go to this court martial.

896
01:55:29,992 --> 01:55:35,859
Three of them died in the scuffle, but him I captured.
Baranov here is a big shot. He's a Captain.

897
01:55:35,909 --> 01:55:42,109
How do you know that? - Boys at the bunker already
questioned him. He was leading the commando.

898
01:55:44,242 --> 01:55:49,109
What kind of a man are you, anyway?
- Don't you know me? I'm Antti Rokka.

899
01:55:49,159 --> 01:55:53,526
Farmer from the Isthmus.
These days, a poster boy for Tikkakoski submachine guns.

900
01:55:57,242 --> 01:55:59,442
Ossi.
- Major.

901
01:55:59,492 --> 01:56:01,942
Take the prisoner outside.
- Yes, sir.

902
01:56:10,451 --> 01:56:13,901
All right. They'll take good care of you.

903
01:56:23,451 --> 01:56:25,651
Sit.

904
01:56:32,284 --> 01:56:36,484
Why do you have to go against
military discipline at every turn?

905
01:56:36,534 --> 01:56:40,942
I don't know a damn thing about discipline.
I've never needed it.

906
01:56:40,992 --> 01:56:43,776
I was happy to come and fight,
I want the Isthmus back.

907
01:56:43,826 --> 01:56:48,567
And I'm such a man,
that none of you are a match for me.

908
01:56:49,867 --> 01:56:53,151
I'm not out here because of you,
I've got a wife and kids.

909
01:56:53,201 --> 01:56:56,317
And you want me to jump like a dog
whenever you say jump?

910
01:56:56,367 --> 01:56:59,151
That's not going to fucking happen, you hear?

911
01:56:59,201 --> 01:57:01,401
You think that's why we're here -

912
01:57:01,451 --> 01:57:05,609
so that there's always someone fawning before you
clicking their heels and blabbering:

913
01:57:05,659 --> 01:57:08,859
"Yes, sir,
yes, sir!"

914
01:57:12,867 --> 01:57:15,442
Not for that.

915
01:57:15,492 --> 01:57:21,026
But what you refer to as fawning,
is an external sign of discipline.

916
01:57:21,076 --> 01:57:24,942
and its absence means
the absence of discipline.

917
01:57:24,992 --> 01:57:28,734
Take into account,
that not everyone is like you.

918
01:57:28,784 --> 01:57:30,776
(Lammio) Be reasonable.

919
01:57:30,826 --> 01:57:34,984
Where do you think you'll find a commander,
who would tolerate as much as I have? - Reasonable.

920
01:57:35,034 --> 01:57:39,609
Goddamn. You've been following your own whims,
not some principles.

921
01:57:39,659 --> 01:57:45,401
Get that 2nd Lieutenant, let's get that
fucking inquiry going! I've had enough.

922
01:57:45,451 --> 01:57:48,776
The battalion will manage just fine without you.

923
01:57:48,826 --> 01:57:54,192
No man is indispensable in a war,
no matter who he is.

924
01:57:59,201 --> 01:58:03,359
I'll forgive you. For now.

925
01:58:03,409 --> 01:58:08,067
From now on,
you'll follow the rules like everyone else.

926
01:58:09,159 --> 01:58:14,276
If you go singing this in the streets,
then it becomes a question of authority -

927
01:58:14,326 --> 01:58:18,734
and if that happens,
I will set the mill to grind.

928
01:58:19,451 --> 01:58:23,817
Your behavior will determine how
your case is handled henceforth. Dismissed.

929
01:58:29,159 --> 01:58:33,317
I just remembered.
We're promised a furlough in exchange for a prisoner.

930
01:58:33,367 --> 01:58:38,567
I'm due an extra 14 days then.
Specially seeing I got me a Captain.

931
01:58:44,701 --> 01:58:50,901
Well, you'll get it. No denying it belongs to you.
Leave a request as soon as possible.

932
01:58:52,117 --> 01:58:55,234
Dismissed.
- Major.

933
01:59:28,492 --> 01:59:33,442
Dad, don't go there anymore.

934
01:59:37,076 --> 01:59:41,109
It should end soon. The war.

935
01:59:42,951 --> 01:59:45,942
Eat your soup.

936
02:00:21,076 --> 02:00:25,026
(Lyyti hums a Karelian song,
remembering words here and there.)

937
02:01:26,659 --> 02:01:28,859
I'm going now.

938
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
SVIR
December 1943

939
02:02:01,076 --> 02:02:04,067
We-were going to lose this war, Antti.

940
02:02:05,367 --> 02:02:08,484
They'll take everything from us.

941
02:02:11,909 --> 02:02:17,109
Paw, don't you worry.
Let the big shots worry.

942
02:02:19,784 --> 02:02:24,151
Attention. Right - face!

943
02:02:25,201 --> 02:02:30,192
Goddammit, men. Behave yourself!
Right - face!

944
02:02:30,242 --> 02:02:33,026
Dismissed - on the double!

945
02:02:47,826 --> 02:02:50,442
(Susi) They'll take it all.

946
02:03:13,659 --> 02:03:19,026
Since it has already grown late, I see it fit
to read a prayer to this humble abode as well.

947
02:03:19,076 --> 02:03:21,901
Protect us from
the ploys of the enemy -

948
02:03:21,951 --> 02:03:25,984
and especially from their snipers
and direct-fire artillery.

949
02:03:29,826 --> 02:03:33,109
The rations could also
be a little larger -

950
02:03:33,159 --> 02:03:37,401
if you can spare any more
for your children's needs.

951
02:03:37,451 --> 02:03:39,859
<i>Make the weather tolerable -</i>

952
02:03:39,909 --> 02:03:44,401
<i>so that it would be more pleasant
to stand guard for your cause.</i>

953
02:03:44,451 --> 02:03:49,234
<i>Moonlight would be welcomed
to ease tensions</i>

954
02:03:49,284 --> 02:03:52,776
<i>and to save our
few flares.</i>

955
02:03:53,909 --> 02:03:58,484
<i>Protect the rangers, guards,
seafarers and horse drivers.</i>

956
02:03:58,534 --> 02:04:01,567
<i>Artillery men aren't that important.</i>

957
02:04:01,617 --> 02:04:04,651
<i>Protect the Commander in Chief,
Chief of the General Staff -</i>

958
02:04:04,701 --> 02:04:07,859
<i>and smaller big shots as well,
if you have time to spare.</i>

959
02:04:07,909 --> 02:04:11,859
Protect the corps, division,
regiment and battalion commanders -

960
02:04:11,909 --> 02:04:15,776
and especially the commander
of the machine gun company.

961
02:04:46,242 --> 02:04:53,067
<i>And finally, in general and separately:
Protect the leaders of Finland.</i>

962
02:04:54,117 --> 02:04:58,609
So that they wouldn't, for the second time,
strike their heads on a Karelian pine tree.

963
02:04:59,867 --> 02:05:01,651
Amen.

964
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:39,000
RETREAT FROM SVIR
June 1944

965
02:05:43,242 --> 02:05:47,276
Greetings. We have to depart now.

966
02:05:49,659 --> 02:05:53,859
<i>(Sarastie) The enemy has launched a grand offensive
in the Karelian Isthmus.</i>

967
02:05:57,367 --> 02:06:01,192
It is advancing rapidly
on both flanks.

968
02:06:01,242 --> 02:06:04,692
Consequently, our regiment
will now start withdrawing towards our old border.

969
02:06:04,742 --> 02:06:10,692
Battalion departure time: 06.00
Get to work.

970
02:06:12,867 --> 02:06:15,401
(Rokka) Get this backpack on.

971
02:06:16,659 --> 02:06:19,359
Good now?

972
02:06:19,409 --> 02:06:23,859
Where do I pack these?
- Take them back. They can wait us here.

973
02:06:23,909 --> 02:06:27,109
We're coming back?
- Sure we are.

974
02:06:28,826 --> 02:06:31,859
We are going to a very nice place.

975
02:06:31,909 --> 02:06:36,442
Hurry up now.
Bring the cows to the yard, they're coming with us.

976
02:07:15,284 --> 02:07:18,109
Some waves from Ääninen.

977
02:07:19,117 --> 02:07:22,692
This stream didn't end up
as Finland's new border.

978
02:07:43,951 --> 02:07:46,401
Air attack!

979
02:07:51,701 --> 02:07:53,901
To cover!

980
02:08:06,367 --> 02:08:09,526
Right.
- Salo was hit.

981
02:08:09,576 --> 02:08:13,692
Get moving, boys!
- Forward!

982
02:08:13,742 --> 02:08:16,109
Get moving!

983
02:08:20,992 --> 02:08:23,734
I'm running.

984
02:08:25,367 --> 02:08:29,109
Before the eyes of the almighty God
and in the presence of this assembly -

985
02:08:29,159 --> 02:08:32,276
I ask you, Jorma Juhani Kariluoto:

986
02:08:32,326 --> 02:08:36,817
will you take Sirkka Linnea Klenberg to be your wedded wife -

987
02:08:36,867 --> 02:08:41,317
and will you be faithful to her and to
love her in days of joy and of adversity,

988
02:08:41,367 --> 02:08:43,401
as long as you both shall live?

989
02:08:43,451 --> 02:08:45,651
I do.

990
02:09:05,034 --> 02:09:07,776
Hey!
- Don't go.

991
02:09:21,159 --> 02:09:24,359
(Sirkka) Would you apply for a transfer to Helsinki?

992
02:09:27,909 --> 02:09:31,067
You'd get it easily.

993
02:09:39,617 --> 02:09:41,817
(Kariluoto) Right...

994
02:09:55,409 --> 02:09:58,567
You've already done your part.

995
02:10:05,367 --> 02:10:10,401
They need me back there.
Every officer is needed at the front.

996
02:10:10,451 --> 02:10:15,151
It is my duty to fight for Finland.
For Ingria and Karelia.

997
02:10:56,367 --> 02:10:59,026
(Kariluoto) Hello there!

998
02:10:59,076 --> 02:11:03,026
Old Ville, you're still around.
But who'd take you out?

999
02:11:03,076 --> 02:11:07,442
God won't have you and the Devil knows he's due.

1000
02:11:07,492 --> 02:11:09,942
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1001
02:11:09,992 --> 02:11:13,942
How are things? - We're here.
Been moving a lot while you've been away.

1002
02:11:13,992 --> 02:11:17,567
2nd platoon is across the road,
1st and 4th are on this side.

1003
02:11:17,617 --> 02:11:19,609
3rd is in reserve.

1004
02:11:19,659 --> 02:11:24,026
Jaeger platoon is patrolling on both flanks,
we have no other reserves.

1005
02:11:24,076 --> 02:11:28,817
Sarastie believed the line along the brook will hold.
- Perhaps.

1006
02:11:28,867 --> 02:11:32,109
But both flanks are open.

1007
02:11:33,617 --> 02:11:36,192
I’ve got a thing or two in my bag.

1008
02:11:36,242 --> 02:11:40,192
I'll change my gear and
take over the company after that.

1009
02:11:50,201 --> 02:11:53,234
It's all over.

1010
02:11:56,409 --> 02:11:59,401
As over as it can be.

1011
02:12:04,617 --> 02:12:07,817
There's no hope, not a trace.

1012
02:12:16,451 --> 02:12:19,651
Then we'll fight hopelessly.

1013
02:12:21,617 --> 02:12:25,317
That’s what we’ve been doing this whole time.

1014
02:12:32,742 --> 02:12:36,942
How old are you?
- Born in 1925, Sergeant.

1015
02:12:36,992 --> 02:12:40,234
Nineteen. I'm astonished.

1016
02:12:40,284 --> 02:12:43,401
We were young as well in the beginning,
but not children.

1017
02:12:43,451 --> 02:12:47,234
Sergeant. Where are the Russkis,
so that I can start killing them?

1018
02:12:47,284 --> 02:12:49,401
Don't yell so loudly.

1019
02:12:49,451 --> 02:12:54,109
They'll hear you and flee
when they realize you've come.

1020
02:13:14,326 --> 02:13:17,901
Get down! Get down!

1021
02:13:32,159 --> 02:13:35,317
Stay in your foxholes. Stay low!

1022
02:13:50,784 --> 02:13:55,109
I told you to stay in your foxhole!

1023
02:13:55,992 --> 02:13:58,067
But you...

1024
02:14:25,492 --> 02:14:28,234
You got hit on your nose a bit.

1025
02:14:30,159 --> 02:14:33,526
It hurts...

1026
02:14:56,534 --> 02:15:00,067
Take it easy.

1027
02:15:00,117 --> 02:15:03,317
Your life doesn't
depend just on your eyes.

1028
02:15:03,367 --> 02:15:08,151
If we make it out alive, we'll certainly meet again.
I'll visit sometime. - See you then.

1029
02:15:09,451 --> 02:15:12,151
Say hello to the guys.

1030
02:15:12,201 --> 02:15:15,401
Take care of yourself.

1031
02:15:22,117 --> 02:15:25,942
I can walk.
I can walk.

1032
02:16:06,159 --> 02:16:09,359
Who's shooting? Our guys?

1033
02:16:21,409 --> 02:16:25,401
Help! I'm burning!

1034
02:16:44,742 --> 02:16:50,651
Help! I'm on fire!
- I'm not leaving you! I'm not leaving you!

1035
02:16:57,284 --> 02:16:59,901
Take my hand.

1036
02:17:08,201 --> 02:17:10,567
I'm not leaving...

1037
02:17:10,742 --> 02:17:13,317
Help! Help!

1038
02:17:14,326 --> 02:17:16,734
Why did you leave me?

1039
02:17:30,951 --> 02:17:34,817
Captain, the enemy has
cut the battalion in two.

1040
02:17:34,867 --> 02:17:37,067
Captain Lammio has ordered us to fall back.

1041
02:17:37,117 --> 02:17:40,401
You're now the senior company commander
on this side of the cutoff.

1042
02:17:40,451 --> 02:17:43,317
Get me the commander
of the Battle Group.

1043
02:17:45,159 --> 02:17:47,776
Connect me to
the Lieutenant Colonel.

1044
02:17:52,451 --> 02:17:54,984
Captain.

1045
02:17:58,492 --> 02:18:01,942
First.
- Cut to minimum edge.

1046
02:18:01,992 --> 02:18:05,942
The position has to be held.
- I can go around.

1047
02:18:05,992 --> 02:18:10,359
<i>Perkele! The point is not to go around,
but to hold the position.</i>

1048
02:18:10,409 --> 02:18:14,692
<i>Fucking goddammit.
A quick strike will solve the situation.</i>

1049
02:18:14,742 --> 02:18:19,526
<i>Hit hard. You choose the method.
- Understood, Colonel.</i>

1050
02:18:19,576 --> 02:18:24,734
We'll quietly withdraw through these swamps,
we can slip out that way. - The order was clear.

1051
02:18:24,784 --> 02:18:29,651
The line can barely hold now.
- The commander knows the situation.

1052
02:18:29,701 --> 02:18:33,734
Excuses are of no use now.
- Karjula doesn't know what he demands of us.

1053
02:18:37,159 --> 02:18:43,734
The enemy has been there for three hours.
You can be fucking sure they've dug their heels in.

1054
02:18:43,784 --> 02:18:46,651
It'll hurt only once.

1055
02:18:49,992 --> 02:18:52,567
You know the order.

1056
02:18:55,076 --> 02:19:00,567
We need to put together a strike squad.
Russki has flanked to the command post.

1057
02:19:00,617 --> 02:19:06,109
We'll counterattack.
- Well I'm a strike squad all by myself, you don't need much more.

1058
02:19:06,159 --> 02:19:10,109
Kariluoto attacks on the other side of the road.
- Got it.

1059
02:19:12,784 --> 02:19:15,567
Asumaniemi, come here.

1060
02:19:19,951 --> 02:19:24,609
Corporal?
- You're coming with me.

1061
02:19:43,826 --> 02:19:46,067
Forward!

1062
02:19:46,117 --> 02:19:48,817
Forward!

1063
02:19:48,867 --> 02:19:51,776
Jeesus perkele!

1064
02:20:21,867 --> 02:20:27,817
Fire at that heap next to the pine!
Shoot like hell! And you, cover me!

1065
02:21:18,117 --> 02:21:20,317
Cover me!

1066
02:21:23,367 --> 02:21:25,484
Cover me!

1067
02:21:54,534 --> 02:21:57,276
Jeesus perkele!

1068
02:22:03,576 --> 02:22:05,817
Bread.

1069
02:22:06,867 --> 02:22:10,401
Let's empty a couple foxholes to clear an opening.
Then we take 'em out.

1070
02:22:11,784 --> 02:22:14,067
Saatana!

1071
02:22:28,201 --> 02:22:30,276
You can't get through here!

1072
02:22:32,534 --> 02:22:35,192
You have grenades?
- No.

1073
02:22:38,242 --> 02:22:40,817
Then we rush!
- Goddammit!

1074
02:22:52,576 --> 02:22:55,026
Koskela! Get up here!

1075
02:22:55,076 --> 02:22:58,192
Boys, forward!

1076
02:23:22,701 --> 02:23:24,942
Private.
- Lieutenant.

1077
02:23:24,992 --> 02:23:29,651
Tell Captain Kariluoto that
the command post has been reclaimed.

1078
02:23:29,701 --> 02:23:34,317
And that Major Sarastie has fallen.
- Understood.

1079
02:24:52,409 --> 02:24:55,359
Ukkola! Ukkola!

1080
02:24:57,742 --> 02:25:01,651
Line! Get in a line!

1081
02:25:24,867 --> 02:25:27,734
We hit 'em now!

1082
02:25:28,826 --> 02:25:33,609
Don't give up!
Fourth, forward!

1083
02:25:34,534 --> 02:25:38,192
Hit 'em now! Forward!
- Forward!

1084
02:25:40,826 --> 02:25:42,692
Forward!

1085
02:25:43,242 --> 02:25:48,984
Runner! - Captain, Koskela can't
continue with the attack immediately.

1086
02:25:49,034 --> 02:25:52,984
The Lieutenant suggests that you wait...
- Wait for what?

1087
02:25:53,034 --> 02:25:56,317
If we can't get through here now,
then it's not going to happen later.

1088
02:25:56,367 --> 02:26:01,942
Say to Koskela that we'll advance.
Leaders, lead by example!

1089
02:26:01,992 --> 02:26:06,026
Fall back!
- Fourth platoon, forward!

1090
02:26:29,576 --> 02:26:32,192
Forward!

1091
02:27:23,909 --> 02:27:27,359
Under my command, the battalion will not
continue with the attack.

1092
02:27:27,409 --> 02:27:30,234
Fucking goddammit.
The positions will not be abandoned.

1093
02:27:30,284 --> 02:27:33,401
Lieutenant, the enemy is
attacking at the brook line.

1094
02:27:33,451 --> 02:27:37,567
The enemy is attacking at the brook line.
The whole battalion can get encircled.

1095
02:27:37,617 --> 02:27:41,359
We're falling back.
- Equipment must be brought with you.

1096
02:27:41,409 --> 02:27:45,901
I'll bring the battalion. Over.
You don't open the radio for a while then.

1097
02:27:45,951 --> 02:27:48,609
Wounded to the northern side of the road.

1098
02:27:48,659 --> 02:27:54,567
What of the dead? We even brought out the Captain's body.
- The living are enough.

1099
02:27:54,617 --> 02:27:58,901
Gather the companies. Move out!

1100
02:28:03,117 --> 02:28:06,317
The machine guns will be
tossed into the pond.

1101
02:28:06,367 --> 02:28:09,942
We’ll just keep one as a souvenir.
Will you bring yours?

1102
02:28:09,992 --> 02:28:12,526
Whatever.
- Just toss?

1103
02:28:12,576 --> 02:28:15,151
Just toss.

1104
02:28:22,659 --> 02:28:25,567
Like this.

1105
02:28:31,367 --> 02:28:33,859
Good riddance, goddamn bitch.

1106
02:28:33,909 --> 02:28:38,651
Get the wounded up and moving.
Viirilä, take point.

1107
02:28:38,701 --> 02:28:40,901
March after me.

1108
02:28:43,409 --> 02:28:47,192
Boys, try to hurry up.

1109
02:29:22,992 --> 02:29:27,734
(Ukkola)
Vanhala... Cover me with something after.

1110
02:31:20,909 --> 02:31:23,817
Load the wounded,
get rid of all the other stuff.

1111
02:31:32,451 --> 02:31:35,817
Perkele. Where was your reserve?

1112
02:31:35,867 --> 02:31:40,109
You're squatting by the road with no cover at all.
- Lieutenant Colonel.

1113
02:31:40,159 --> 02:31:44,234
We lost our best possible position because
of your hasty assessment of the situation.

1114
02:31:44,284 --> 02:31:49,984
The men were disheartened by the losses.
- I know the situation, you don't have to explain it to me.

1115
02:31:50,034 --> 02:31:55,401
You handle the battalion until Lammio arrives.
Lieutenant Ovaska gets the machine guns.

1116
02:31:55,451 --> 02:31:59,984
I told the men to toss the machine guns into the pond
to get them to carry the wounded.

1117
02:32:00,034 --> 02:32:02,942
I left only one.

1118
02:32:03,534 --> 02:32:08,442
Into the pond? Tossed the machine guns?
Goddammit, Lieutenant.

1119
02:32:11,284 --> 02:32:16,401
This is deliberate sabotage,
you're aiding the enemy!

1120
02:32:16,451 --> 02:32:18,484
I told you to bring the equipment.

1121
02:32:18,534 --> 02:32:23,484
Machine gunners are machine gunners,
not medics.

1122
02:32:23,534 --> 02:32:28,901
You were the battalion commander,
not a goddamn nurse.

1123
02:32:28,951 --> 02:32:32,359
And men! Attention!

1124
02:32:34,367 --> 02:32:39,067
Are you sheep or Finnish soldiers?

1125
02:32:40,492 --> 02:32:45,442
The positions are either held,
or you die in them.

1126
02:32:46,617 --> 02:32:49,526
Be ashamed, goddammit!

1127
02:32:52,742 --> 02:32:57,817
I wouldn't dare call myself a Finn,
if I behaved like you lot.

1128
02:33:01,159 --> 02:33:03,984
And now, man the positions.

1129
02:34:07,867 --> 02:34:10,317
Stay put!

1130
02:34:44,867 --> 02:34:47,317
They'll steamroll us!
- No they won't.

1131
02:34:47,367 --> 02:34:51,234
There's a minefield there. Stay put!

1132
02:34:56,742 --> 02:35:01,026
Sergeant! Grab a satchel charge, we're going.
- You can't get there!

1133
02:35:09,867 --> 02:35:12,234
Satchel charge.

1134
02:35:19,117 --> 02:35:21,984
Let's go!

1135
02:35:49,826 --> 02:35:52,067
Go, go!

1136
02:37:20,867 --> 02:37:26,026
Positions lost. Third company is
partly fleeing in panic.

1137
02:37:31,117 --> 02:37:34,401
Perkele! Perkele!

1138
02:37:46,076 --> 02:37:49,984
Goddamn flock of sheep!
Not a step further!

1139
02:37:50,034 --> 02:37:54,942
Man the positions! Those who still flee,
have forfeited their lives.

1140
02:37:54,992 --> 02:37:57,442
Not a step further!

1141
02:38:00,159 --> 02:38:02,359
Boys, they're coming. Tanks!

1142
02:38:02,951 --> 02:38:05,442
Stop! Where are you going?

1143
02:38:05,492 --> 02:38:08,609
Stop!
For the last time, where do you think you're going?

1144
02:38:08,659 --> 02:38:11,317
To Inari to fuck some wolves.

1145
02:38:12,326 --> 02:38:16,026
Under military law,
I sentenced the traitor to die.

1146
02:38:17,284 --> 02:38:20,109
This is about Finland.

1147
02:38:21,409 --> 02:38:24,276
Goddammit!
Everyone, man your positions!

1148
02:38:28,992 --> 02:38:33,109
Man your positions! Perkele!

1149
02:38:42,034 --> 02:38:44,442
Get down!
- Go!

1150
02:38:44,492 --> 02:38:46,942
Don't flee!

1151
02:38:48,326 --> 02:38:52,859
Don't flee!
Everyone to your positions!

1152
02:38:53,992 --> 02:38:58,401
Don't flee!
Get to positions!

1153
02:39:07,034 --> 02:39:09,609
Help!

1154
02:39:17,742 --> 02:39:20,359
Positi...

1155
02:39:30,367 --> 02:39:36,109
Keep your distance.
More distance!

1156
02:39:37,492 --> 02:39:39,984
(Lotta)
I can't ride with this. Can I hop on?

1157
02:39:40,034 --> 02:39:45,067
(Korpela)
We don't haul horse shit on Sundays.
That's how it fucking is.

1158
02:39:45,117 --> 02:39:49,067
(Lammio) Leave your bicycle,
get on the next vehicle.

1159
02:39:49,117 --> 02:39:52,276
Private Korpela. What did you just say?

1160
02:39:52,326 --> 02:39:57,317
I said what I said. What kind of
fancy pants are you, following me around?

1161
02:39:57,367 --> 02:40:02,109
Flies have usually swarmed around horses.
Are they swarming around people now too?

1162
02:40:02,159 --> 02:40:06,026
Get to cover!

1163
02:40:17,159 --> 02:40:19,526
Go away!

1164
02:40:22,326 --> 02:40:26,859
You fuckers just keep on shooting!
Well shoot away!

1165
02:40:32,500 --> 02:40:37,000
LAST DEFENSIVE POSITIONS
July 1944

1166
02:40:54,451 --> 02:41:00,401
You remember how we swam in Vuoksi as kids?
- Antti, we're never seeing that river again.

1167
02:41:00,451 --> 02:41:05,776
Nothing but corpses swimming there now.
- We're gonna be swimming in that river, you believe me?

1168
02:41:05,826 --> 02:41:08,567
If anybody gets that far.

1169
02:41:17,284 --> 02:41:20,109
Boys, don't save your sugar.

1170
02:41:20,159 --> 02:41:23,776
It'll just get all wet and then it'll be ruined.
We're swimming soon.

1171
02:41:23,826 --> 02:41:28,901
We’ll hop that stream if it comes to it.
- Damn it, boy! You hush up now, you hear?

1172
02:41:28,951 --> 02:41:31,651
Swallow that sugar,
don’t leave it to get wet!

1173
02:41:31,701 --> 02:41:34,192
The officers keep babbling that
these positions are going to hold.

1174
02:41:34,242 --> 02:41:40,151
I don't know what it is, but I just don't get along
with those officers. - I don't know.

1175
02:41:40,201 --> 02:41:45,984
Have you ever thought
that you might be at fault?

1176
02:41:49,034 --> 02:41:52,859
Me?
- Yep.

1177
02:41:56,242 --> 02:42:01,026
I'm always speaking sense.
They just keep on babbling about nothing.

1178
02:42:03,659 --> 02:42:07,651
Karelia is gone. The war is lost.

1179
02:42:07,701 --> 02:42:13,609
I don't have anything to lose anymore.
I'm just trying to make them pay for taking the Isthmus.

1180
02:42:50,534 --> 02:42:54,151
(Asumaniemi)
All right guys, we'll get to fight soon!

1181
02:43:00,034 --> 02:43:04,984
Antti, get away from there.
Antti, Antti, get in this pit.

1182
02:43:13,742 --> 02:43:16,109
We leave now.

1183
02:43:16,159 --> 02:43:20,526
Fall back.
- Paw, you go ahead.

1184
02:43:45,492 --> 02:43:48,776
Boys, get back!

1185
02:44:29,992 --> 02:44:34,776
Okay, young guys go over first, we'll hold them off.
Määttä, take the machine gun.

1186
02:44:34,826 --> 02:44:37,692
Go!

1187
02:45:15,909 --> 02:45:19,609
(Vanhala) They're on the other side! I'm going!
- Fall back!

1188
02:45:26,159 --> 02:45:29,442
Paw, get across! Go!

1189
02:45:39,367 --> 02:45:42,859
Antti, I'm hit!
- How bad?

1190
02:45:53,034 --> 02:45:55,651
Leave me!

1191
02:46:39,492 --> 02:46:41,692
(Honkajoki) Rokka!

1192
02:46:52,367 --> 02:46:55,526
Cover them!

1193
02:47:35,867 --> 02:47:40,984
Antti, you've been hit,
I heard it.

1194
02:48:05,409 --> 02:48:09,692
(Jalovaara) Vanhala, gather a strike squad.
We have to recapture the positions.

1195
02:48:09,742 --> 02:48:13,234
You see that body?
- Yes.

1196
02:48:13,284 --> 02:48:19,567
There's a light machine gun next to it.
Get to the grave and take it out.

1197
02:48:19,617 --> 02:48:22,651
I can get to the grave.
If not there, then at least to my own.

1198
02:48:22,701 --> 02:48:26,609
I better take Asumaniemi and Honkajoki,
no more.

1199
02:48:26,659 --> 02:48:28,359
We'll provide cover fire.

1200
02:48:28,409 --> 02:48:32,692
I don't dare to volunteer.
You have to order me to go.

1201
02:48:32,742 --> 02:48:36,776
Well, then I order you to go.
- Well, that's a different story.

1202
02:48:36,826 --> 02:48:39,609
Submachine gun.

1203
02:48:48,409 --> 02:48:50,776
(Asumaniemi) Let's go!

1204
02:49:02,409 --> 02:49:06,317
Goddammit, boy!
- You got the grenades ready?

02:49:28,534 --> 02:49:31,401
(Asumaniemi) Throw right.

1206
02:49:49,659 --> 02:49:51,484
(Asumaniemi) Ding ding.

1207
02:49:54,701 --> 02:49:57,151
(Asumaniemi) Slobos are leaving.

1208
02:49:59,576 --> 02:50:02,692
Get moving!

1209
02:50:11,742 --> 02:50:16,609
(Asumaniemi) We succeeded.
- Strike squad Vanhala, excellent work.

1210

Your native land won't forget you.

1211

02:51:06,159 --> 02:51:08,984
No more...

1214
02:51:18,117 --> 02:51:22,776
No more...Stop it!

1215
02:51:25,826 --> 02:51:31,401
Have to get out!
Let me go!

1216
02:52:13,076 --> 02:52:16,276
The loser will get the shit kicked out of it,
and that's that.

1217
02:52:22,284 --> 02:52:25,484
If we had that bow now.

<i>(Radio speech) Honorable citizens,
this is a summary of the situation:</i>

1219
02:52:41,534 --> 02:52:44,442
<i>We have taken the first step -</i>

1220
02:52:44,492 --> 02:52:47,817
<i>towards peaceful relations -</i>

1221
02:52:47,867 --> 02:52:51,109
<i>with our great eastern neighbour.</i>

1222
02:52:51,159 --> 02:52:57,192
<i>We have taken a step in a road,
which might hold unexpected dangers.</i>

1223
02:52:57,242 --> 02:53:02,359
<i>We do not yet know the terms,
that will be placed upon us -</i>

1224
02:53:02,409 --> 02:53:08,276
<i>but because our great eastern neighbour
has not demanded our unconditional surrender -</i>

1225
02:53:08,326 --> 02:53:11,151
<i>we have seen it as our duty -</i>

1226
02:53:11,201 --> 02:53:15,901
<i>to fulfill the preconditions set by
the Soviet government and her allies -</i>

1227
02:53:15,951 --> 02:53:20,151
<i>and thusly demonstrate
our sincere desire for peace.</i>
