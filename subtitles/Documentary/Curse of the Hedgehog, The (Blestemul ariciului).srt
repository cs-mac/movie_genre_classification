1
00:00:29,614 --> 00:00:34,157
Drink up, me hearties, yo ho

2
00:00:34,244 --> 00:00:38,787
We kidnap and ravage
and don't give a hoot

3
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:42,741
Drink up, me hearties, yo ho

4
00:00:42,836 --> 00:00:45,836
Yo ho, yo ho

5
00:00:45,922 --> 00:00:48,876
A pirate's life for me

6
00:00:49,592 --> 00:00:54,835
We extort, we pilfer
We filch, we sack...

7
00:00:55,223 --> 00:00:58,592
Quiet, missy!
Cursed pirates sail these waters.

8
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:00,969
You don't want to bring
them down on us.

9
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:02,971
Mr Gibbs, that will do.

10
00:01:03,773 --> 00:01:05,766
She was singing about pirates!

11
00:01:05,859 --> 00:01:09,903
Bad luck to sing about pirates
with us mired in this unnatural fog.

12
00:01:09,988 --> 00:01:13,357
- Mark my words.
- Consider them marked.

13
00:01:14,242 --> 00:01:16,614
- On your way.
- Aye, Lieutenant.

14
00:01:16,703 --> 00:01:21,661
Bad luck to have a woman on board,
too. Even a miniature one.

15
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:24,699
It'd be exciting to meet a pirate.

16
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:31,337
Think again, Miss Swann.
Vile creatures, the lot of them.

17
00:01:31,426 --> 00:01:35,803
I intend to see to it that any man
who sails under a pirate flag

18
00:01:35,889 --> 00:01:37,881
gets what he deserves.

19
00:01:38,474 --> 00:01:40,633
A short drop and a sudden stop.

20
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:47,014
I appreciate your fervour,

21
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:51,984
but I'm concerned about the effect this
subject will have upon my daughter.

22
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:53,815
My apologies, Governor Swann.

23
00:01:53,907 --> 00:01:57,951
- Actually, I find it all fascinating.
- That's what concerns me.

24
00:02:26,356 --> 00:02:28,763
There's a boy in the water!

25
00:02:31,236 --> 00:02:33,062
Man overboard!

26
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:38,356
Man the ropes! Fetch a hook!
Haul him aboard!

27
00:02:46,918 --> 00:02:48,827
He's still breathing.

28
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,162
Mary, Mother of God!

29
00:02:57,554 --> 00:03:00,258
What happened here?

30
00:03:00,682 --> 00:03:04,514
Most likely the powder magazine.
Merchant vessels run heavily armed.

31
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:11,725
Lot of good it did them.
Everyone's thinking it, I'm saying it.

32
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:13,645
Pirates!

33
00:03:14,362 --> 00:03:17,778
There's no proof of that!
It was probably an accident.

34
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:24,157
Rouse the captain. Heave to
and take in sail. Launch the boats.

35
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,991
Elizabeth, accompany the boy.

36
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:32,922
He'll be in your charge.
Take care of him.

37
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:33,207
He'll be in your charge.
Take care of him.

38
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:57,023
It's okay. My name's Elizabeth Swann.

39
00:03:57,989 --> 00:03:59,816
Will Turner.

40
00:04:00,825 --> 00:04:02,818
I'm watching over you, Will.

41
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,666
You're a pirate!

42
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,550
Has he said anything?

43
00:04:19,636 --> 00:04:23,633
His name's William Turner.
That's all I found out.

44
00:04:23,723 --> 00:04:25,632
Take him below.

45
00:05:35,128 --> 00:05:36,836
Elizabeth!

46
00:05:38,715 --> 00:05:40,707
Are you all right?

47
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:43,002
Are you decent?

48
00:05:43,094 --> 00:05:44,257
Yes.

49
00:05:44,512 --> 00:05:46,256
Yes?

50
00:05:46,681 --> 00:05:49,219
Still abed at this hour?

51
00:05:50,143 --> 00:05:52,100
It's a beautiful day.

52
00:05:53,938 --> 00:05:56,145
I have a gift for you.

53
00:05:59,194 --> 00:06:01,685
- It's beautiful!
- Isn't it?

54
00:06:03,239 --> 00:06:05,528
May I inquire as to the occasion?

55
00:06:05,617 --> 00:06:09,449
Does a father need an occasion
to dote upon his daughter?

56
00:06:10,205 --> 00:06:11,948
Go on.

57
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:20,498
Actually... I had hoped you might
wear it for the ceremony today.

58
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,835
The ceremony?

59
00:06:21,925 --> 00:06:24,594
Captain Norrington's
promotion ceremony.

60
00:06:24,677 --> 00:06:25,875
I knew it!

61
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,924
Commodore Norrington,
as he's about to become.

62
00:06:29,015 --> 00:06:33,227
A fine gentleman, don't you think?
He fancies you, you know.

63
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:37,105
Elizabeth? How's it coming?

64
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:41,895
- It's difficult to say.
- It's the latest fashion in London.

65
00:06:42,195 --> 00:06:45,730
Women in London
must've learned not to breathe!

66
00:06:47,325 --> 00:06:48,903
My Lord, you have a visitor.

67
00:07:07,512 --> 00:07:10,217
Mr Turner! Good to see you again.

68
00:07:10,306 --> 00:07:13,924
Good day, sir. I have your order.

69
00:07:20,984 --> 00:07:25,811
The blade is folded steel. That's
gold filigree laid into the handle.

70
00:07:26,573 --> 00:07:28,399
If I may?

71
00:07:29,993 --> 00:07:31,369
Perfectly balanced. The tang
is nearly the width of the blade.

72
00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:34,536
Perfectly balanced. The tang
is nearly the width of the blade.

73
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,617
Impressive. Very impressive.

74
00:07:41,421 --> 00:07:44,754
Commodore Norrington's
going to be very pleased with this.

75
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:48,004
Do pass my compliments
onto your master.

76
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,839
I shall.

77
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:56,466
A craftsman is always pleased
to hear his work is appreciated.

78
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:00,930
Elizabeth!
You look absolutely stunning!

79
00:08:01,357 --> 00:08:04,940
Will! It's so good to see you!

80
00:08:06,154 --> 00:08:09,190
- I had a dream about you last night.
- About me?

81
00:08:09,282 --> 00:08:13,232
- Elizabeth, is that proper...?
- About the day we met. Remember?

82
00:08:13,328 --> 00:08:15,404
How could I forget, Miss Swann?

83
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:18,830
How many times must I ask you
to call me Elizabeth?

84
00:08:18,917 --> 00:08:22,167
At least once more, Miss Swann.
As always.

85
00:08:22,337 --> 00:08:26,002
There. See? At least the boy
has a sense of propriety.

86
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,297
We really must be going.

87
00:08:29,677 --> 00:08:31,884
Good day, Mr Turner.

88
00:08:32,514 --> 00:08:34,471
Come along!

89
00:08:36,935 --> 00:08:38,559
Good day...

90
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,522
Elizabeth.

91
00:10:13,406 --> 00:10:15,564
Hold up there, you!

92
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:19,993
It's a shilling to tie up
your boat to the dock.

93
00:10:21,873 --> 00:10:24,446
I need to know your name.

94
00:10:26,377 --> 00:10:30,956
What do you say to three shillings
and we forget the name?

95
00:10:33,468 --> 00:10:36,173
Welcome to Port Royal, Mr Smith.

96
00:11:11,923 --> 00:11:13,714
Two paces... march!

97
00:11:16,261 --> 00:11:18,300
Right about... face!

98
00:11:20,807 --> 00:11:23,559
Present... arms!

99
00:11:47,876 --> 00:11:48,251
This dock is off limits to civilians.

100
00:11:48,251 --> 00:11:50,623
This dock is off limits to civilians.

101
00:11:50,712 --> 00:11:55,174
I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know.
If I see one, I shall inform you.

102
00:11:58,845 --> 00:12:02,463
There's some high-toned
and fancy to-do at the fort.

103
00:12:02,557 --> 00:12:07,634
How could it be that two upstanding
gentlemen did not merit an invitation?

104
00:12:07,896 --> 00:12:11,644
We have to make sure this dock
stays off limits to civilians.

105
00:12:11,733 --> 00:12:17,688
It's a fine goal, to be sure,
but it seems to me, a ship like that

106
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,354
makes this one here
a bit superfluous.

107
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:23,534
The Dauntless is the power
in these waters,

108
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:27,534
but there's no ship that can match
the Interceptor for speed.

109
00:12:27,624 --> 00:12:31,456
I've heard of one. It's supposed
to be fast, nigh uncatchable.

110
00:12:32,045 --> 00:12:33,705
The Black Pearl.

111
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,589
There's no real ship
that can match the Interceptor.

112
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,760
The Black Pearl is a real ship.

113
00:12:42,847 --> 00:12:45,848
- No, it's not.
- It is. I've seen it!

114
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:48,766
- You've seen it?
- Yes.

115
00:12:48,853 --> 00:12:51,938
- You haven't seen it!
- Yes, I have!

116
00:12:52,023 --> 00:12:57,230
You've seen a ship with black sails,
that's crewed by the damned

117
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:02,527
and captained by a man so evil
that Hell itself spat him back out?

118
00:13:03,368 --> 00:13:05,989
- No.
- No.

119
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,996
But I have seen a ship
with black sails.

120
00:13:09,082 --> 00:13:11,489
No ship not crewed by the damned

121
00:13:11,584 --> 00:13:14,621
and captained by a man so evil,
Hell spat him back out,

122
00:13:14,712 --> 00:13:19,090
could have black sails, so couldn't be
any other ship than The Black Pearl.

123
00:13:19,175 --> 00:13:21,713
Is that what you're saying?

124
00:13:21,886 --> 00:13:22,917
No.

125
00:13:23,012 --> 00:13:27,591
Like I said, there's no real ship
that can match the Interceptor...

126
00:13:32,564 --> 00:13:38,150
You! Get away from there!
You don't have permission to be aboard!

127
00:13:38,236 --> 00:13:41,023
I'm sorry, but it's such a pretty
boat. Ship!

128
00:13:41,781 --> 00:13:45,613
- What's your name?
- Smith! Or Smithy, if you like.

129
00:13:45,702 --> 00:13:48,987
What's your purpose in Port Royal,
'Mr Smith'?

130
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,663
- And no lies!
- All right. I confess.

131
00:13:53,543 --> 00:13:56,462
I intend to commandeer a ship,
pick up a crew in Tortuga,

132
00:13:56,462 --> 00:13:56,877
I intend to commandeer a ship,
pick up a crew in Tortuga,

133
00:13:56,963 --> 00:13:59,834
rape, pillage and otherwise
pilfer my black guts out.

134
00:13:59,924 --> 00:14:03,874
- I said no lies!
- I think he's telling the truth.

135
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:07,256
If he were telling the truth,
he wouldn't have told us.

136
00:14:07,515 --> 00:14:11,347
Unless he knew you wouldn't believe
the truth even if he told you.

137
00:14:21,613 --> 00:14:23,439
May I have a moment?

138
00:14:32,415 --> 00:14:34,657
You look lovely, Elizabeth.

139
00:14:37,128 --> 00:14:41,956
I apologise if I seem forward,
but I must speak my mind.

140
00:14:44,844 --> 00:14:50,847
This promotion throws into sharp relief
that which I have not yet achieved.

141
00:14:53,311 --> 00:14:55,600
A marriage to a fine woman.

142
00:14:56,606 --> 00:14:59,275
You have become a fine woman.

143
00:15:00,276 --> 00:15:01,901
I can't breathe!

144
00:15:01,986 --> 00:15:04,773
Yes, I'm a bit nervous myself.

145
00:15:07,659 --> 00:15:09,865
Then they made me their chief.

146
00:15:12,288 --> 00:15:13,948
Elizabeth?

147
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,917
Elizabeth!

148
00:15:19,337 --> 00:15:22,421
The rocks!
Sir, it's a miracle she missed them!

149
00:15:24,551 --> 00:15:27,386
- Will you be saving her?
- I can't swim!

150
00:15:29,055 --> 00:15:33,100
Pride of the King's Navy, you are!
Do not lose these.

151
00:15:47,323 --> 00:15:49,150
What was that?

152
00:16:31,826 --> 00:16:33,653
I got her!

153
00:16:33,828 --> 00:16:36,615
- She's not breathing!
- Move!

154
00:16:42,754 --> 00:16:47,250
- I never would've thought of that.
- You've never been to Singapore.

155
00:16:52,263 --> 00:16:54,055
Where did you get that?

156
00:16:56,267 --> 00:16:57,678
On your feet.

157
00:16:59,854 --> 00:17:02,310
Elizabeth!

158
00:17:02,523 --> 00:17:04,516
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

159
00:17:09,531 --> 00:17:11,404
- Shoot him!
- Father!

160
00:17:11,491 --> 00:17:15,405
Commodore, do you intend
to kill my rescuer?

161
00:17:21,584 --> 00:17:23,376
I believe thanks are in order.

162
00:17:28,007 --> 00:17:32,087
Had a brush with the East India
Trading Company, pirate?

163
00:17:33,263 --> 00:17:34,757
Hang him!

164
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:38,715
Keep your guns on him, men.
Gillette, fetch some irons.

165
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:42,013
Well, well. Jack Sparrow, isn't it?

166
00:17:42,814 --> 00:17:45,387
Captain Jack Sparrow,
if you please, sir.

167
00:17:45,483 --> 00:17:48,484
I don't see your ship... 'Captain'.

168
00:17:48,695 --> 00:17:50,983
I'm in the market, as it were.

169
00:17:51,072 --> 00:17:53,361
He said he'd come to commandeer one.

170
00:17:53,449 --> 00:17:56,569
I told you he was telling the truth.
These are his.

171
00:17:59,455 --> 00:18:02,575
No additional shot nor powder.

172
00:18:04,168 --> 00:18:06,291
A compass that doesn't point north.

173
00:18:11,342 --> 00:18:14,592
I half expected it to be made from wood.

174
00:18:16,264 --> 00:18:20,096
You are without doubt
the worst pirate I've ever heard of!

175
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:22,426
But you have heard of me.

176
00:18:24,606 --> 00:18:26,598
Commodore, I must protest!

177
00:18:27,066 --> 00:18:28,774
Carefully, Lieutenant.

178
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:31,066
Pirate or not, this man saved my life!

179
00:18:31,154 --> 00:18:35,068
One good deed is not enough to redeem
a man for his wickedness!

180
00:18:35,158 --> 00:18:37,910
- It seems enough to condemn him.
- Indeed.

181
00:18:39,537 --> 00:18:40,866
Finally.

182
00:18:42,457 --> 00:18:45,411
- Don't shoot!
- I knew you'd warm up to me.

183
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:49,630
Commodore Norrington,
my effects, please. And my hat.

184
00:18:50,298 --> 00:18:51,626
Commodore.

185
00:18:54,552 --> 00:18:57,553
- Elizabeth... it is Elizabeth?
- It's Miss Swann.

186
00:18:57,639 --> 00:19:02,881
Miss Swann, if you'd be so kind.
Come, dear, we don't have all day.

187
00:19:04,312 --> 00:19:06,305
If you'll be very kind.

188
00:19:22,747 --> 00:19:25,036
Easy on the goods, darling.

189
00:19:25,542 --> 00:19:28,957
- You're despicable.
- Sticks and stones, love.

190
00:19:29,128 --> 00:19:31,798
I saved your life, you saved mine.
We're square.

191
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,545
Gentlemen, my lady,

192
00:19:35,635 --> 00:19:38,968
you will always remember this
as the day you almost caught...

193
00:19:39,055 --> 00:19:41,511
Captain Jack Sparrow!

194
00:20:00,118 --> 00:20:03,321
- Now will you shoot him?
- Open fire!

195
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,663
On his heels!

196
00:20:28,021 --> 00:20:30,060
Take cover, man!

197
00:20:30,148 --> 00:20:34,893
Gillette, Mr. Sparrow has
a dawn appointment with the gallows.

198
00:20:34,986 --> 00:20:37,192
I would hate for him to miss it.

199
00:20:40,867 --> 00:20:42,859
Search up the stairs!

200
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,612
Look lively, men!

201
00:22:18,256 --> 00:22:19,964
Right where I left you.

202
00:22:26,973 --> 00:22:29,594
Not where I left you.

203
00:22:38,943 --> 00:22:41,150
You're the one they're hunting.

204
00:22:41,779 --> 00:22:43,571
The pirate!

205
00:22:43,656 --> 00:22:46,776
You seem familiar.
Have I threatened you before?

206
00:22:46,868 --> 00:22:49,655
I avoid familiarity with pirates.

207
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:55,243
It would be a shame to put a black
mark on your record. Excuse me.

208
00:22:59,172 --> 00:23:03,668
Do you think this wise, boy?
Crossing blades with a pirate?

209
00:23:04,802 --> 00:23:07,258
You threatened Miss Swann.

210
00:23:09,349 --> 00:23:11,222
Only a little.

211
00:23:24,322 --> 00:23:30,076
You know what you're doing.
Excellent form. How's your footwork?

212
00:23:30,161 --> 00:23:32,284
If I step here...

213
00:23:33,581 --> 00:23:34,992
Good.

214
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:37,159
And now I step again.

215
00:23:42,382 --> 00:23:44,006
Ta.

216
00:24:03,194 --> 00:24:05,353
That is a wonderful trick.

217
00:24:06,155 --> 00:24:09,690
Except, once again,
you are between me and my way out.

218
00:24:09,784 --> 00:24:12,820
And now...
you have no weapon.

219
00:24:35,184 --> 00:24:36,809
Who makes all these?

220
00:24:38,313 --> 00:24:39,593
I do.

221
00:24:40,064 --> 00:24:43,564
And I practice with them
three hours a day.

222
00:24:45,486 --> 00:24:47,562
You need to find yourself a girl, mate.

223
00:24:54,329 --> 00:24:59,156
Or, the reason you practice three hours
a day is that you already found one

224
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:02,868
and are otherwise incapable
of wooing said strumpet.

225
00:25:02,962 --> 00:25:05,453
You're not a eunuch, are you?

226
00:25:05,548 --> 00:25:09,925
I practice three hours a day
so when I meet a pirate, I can kill him!

227
00:26:27,171 --> 00:26:29,460
- You cheated!
- Pirate.

228
00:26:33,052 --> 00:26:35,045
- Move away!
- No.

229
00:26:35,138 --> 00:26:36,513
Please?

230
00:26:36,598 --> 00:26:40,382
No! I cannot just step aside
and let you escape.

231
00:26:42,979 --> 00:26:44,972
This shot is not meant for you.

232
00:26:55,325 --> 00:26:57,317
There he is! Over here!

233
00:26:59,412 --> 00:27:05,248
Excellent work, Mr Brown. You've
assisted in the capture of a fugitive.

234
00:27:05,335 --> 00:27:07,623
Just doing my civic duty, sir.

235
00:27:08,838 --> 00:27:14,674
I trust you will remember this as the
day Captain Jack Sparrow almost escaped.

236
00:27:14,761 --> 00:27:16,303
Take him away.

237
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:26,853
- Come here, boy. Come here.
- Who wants a juicy bone?

238
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:29,232
Come here, boy!

239
00:27:30,026 --> 00:27:34,237
You can keep doing that forever.
The dog is never going to move.

240
00:27:34,322 --> 00:27:38,450
Excuse us if we haven't resigned
ourselves to the gallows just yet.

241
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:49,544
There you go, miss. It was
a difficult day for you, I'm sure.

242
00:27:49,629 --> 00:27:54,789
I suspected Commodore Norrington would
propose, but I wasn't prepared for it.

243
00:27:54,884 --> 00:27:59,048
I meant you being threatened
by that pirate! Sounds terrifying!

244
00:28:00,598 --> 00:28:02,425
Yes, it was terrifying.

245
00:28:02,517 --> 00:28:05,720
But... the Commodore proposed!
Fancy that.

246
00:28:05,812 --> 00:28:09,596
That's a smart match, miss,
if it's not too bold to say.

247
00:28:09,691 --> 00:28:11,101
It is a smart match.

248
00:28:12,235 --> 00:28:14,026
He's a fine man.

249
00:28:15,113 --> 00:28:18,778
He's what any woman
should dream of marrying.

250
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:23,244
That Will Turner...
he's a fine man, too.

251
00:28:23,329 --> 00:28:25,121
That is too bold.

252
00:28:25,206 --> 00:28:28,990
Beggin' your pardon.
It was not my place.

253
00:29:17,842 --> 00:29:20,843
Has my daughter
given you an answer yet?

254
00:29:20,929 --> 00:29:22,553
No, she hasn't.

255
00:29:22,639 --> 00:29:24,964
She has had a trying day.

256
00:29:26,643 --> 00:29:30,771
- Ghastly weather, don't you think?
- Really bleak.

257
00:29:32,565 --> 00:29:34,225
What's that?

258
00:29:34,651 --> 00:29:36,524
Cannon fire!

259
00:29:37,904 --> 00:29:39,778
Return fire!

260
00:29:40,323 --> 00:29:42,197
I know those guns.

261
00:29:47,872 --> 00:29:49,912
It's the Pearl.

262
00:29:49,999 --> 00:29:51,992
The Black Pearl?

263
00:29:53,962 --> 00:29:55,753
I've heard stories.

264
00:29:55,838 --> 00:29:59,836
She's been preying on ships
and settlements for ten years.

265
00:29:59,926 --> 00:30:03,010
- Never leaves any survivors.
- No survivors?

266
00:30:03,846 --> 00:30:06,883
Then where do the stories
come from, I wonder?

267
00:30:30,623 --> 00:30:32,082
Mama!

268
00:31:38,858 --> 00:31:41,432
- Sight the muzzle flash.
- Aim for the flashes!

269
00:31:41,527 --> 00:31:45,905
I need a full spread, fore and aft.
Mr Stevens, more cartridges.

270
00:31:46,199 --> 00:31:50,113
Governor. Barricade yourself
in my office.

271
00:31:51,371 --> 00:31:53,577
That's an order.

272
00:32:11,307 --> 00:32:12,683
Don't!

273
00:32:13,101 --> 00:32:15,140
Hello, chum.

274
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:20,058
Up there!

275
00:32:29,867 --> 00:32:32,537
Miss Swann,
they've come to kidnap you.

276
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:35,242
- What?
- You're the governor's daughter!

277
00:32:35,331 --> 00:32:37,240
In here!

278
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:42,331
They haven't seen you.
First chance you get, run to the fort.

279
00:32:51,264 --> 00:32:52,972
Gotcha!

280
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,471
No! It's hot. I'm burning!

281
00:33:01,566 --> 00:33:02,645
Come on!

282
00:33:07,071 --> 00:33:09,278
Come on, me men.

283
00:33:46,027 --> 00:33:49,728
We know you're here, poppet.

284
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:53,491
- Poppet!
- Come out.

285
00:33:53,701 --> 00:33:56,157
We promise we won't hurt you.

286
00:33:58,331 --> 00:34:00,904
We will find you, poppet.

287
00:34:01,459 --> 00:34:05,706
You've got something of ours
and it calls to us.

288
00:34:11,427 --> 00:34:13,883
The gold calls to us.

289
00:34:14,973 --> 00:34:17,345
The gold.

290
00:34:22,272 --> 00:34:24,348
Hello, poppet.

291
00:34:24,899 --> 00:34:27,106
Parley.

292
00:34:27,193 --> 00:34:30,562
- What?
- I invoke the right of parley.

293
00:34:30,655 --> 00:34:36,029
The Code of the Brethren states
you have to take me to your captain.

294
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:37,779
I know the Code.

295
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:41,738
You can do me no harm
until the parley is complete.

296
00:34:41,833 --> 00:34:46,459
- To blazes with the Code.
- She wants to be taken to the Captain.

297
00:34:46,921 --> 00:34:49,210
And she'll go, without a fuss.

298
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:53,336
We must honour the Code.

299
00:35:04,063 --> 00:35:05,973
Say goodbye!

300
00:35:09,903 --> 00:35:11,313
Goodbye.

301
00:35:15,575 --> 00:35:18,066
- Come on.
- Elizabeth.

302
00:35:26,753 --> 00:35:28,876
Out of my way, scum!

303
00:35:40,975 --> 00:35:43,893
My sympathies. You've no manner
of luck at all.

304
00:36:06,417 --> 00:36:09,584
Come on, doggy! It's just
you and me now.

305
00:36:09,671 --> 00:36:16,041
It's you and old Jack. Come on.
That's a boy! Get your bone!

306
00:36:16,135 --> 00:36:19,718
That's a good boy.
A bit closer!

307
00:36:20,056 --> 00:36:22,132
That's it, doggy!

308
00:36:22,225 --> 00:36:25,558
Come on, you filthy,
slimy, mangy character!

309
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,267
No! I didn't mean it!

310
00:36:37,156 --> 00:36:39,363
This ain't the armoury!

311
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:46,697
Well, well, well. Look what we have
here, Twigg. Captain Jack Sparrow!

312
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:50,034
Last time I saw you,

313
00:36:50,128 --> 00:36:56,747
you were all alone on a godforsaken
island, shrinking into the distance.

314
00:36:57,051 --> 00:36:59,589
His fortunes aren't improved much.

315
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:03,095
Worry about your own fortunes,
gentlemen.

316
00:37:03,182 --> 00:37:07,844
The deepest circle of Hell is reserved
for betrayers and mutineers.

317
00:37:11,983 --> 00:37:14,141
So there is a curse.

318
00:37:15,653 --> 00:37:19,521
- That's interesting.
- You know nothing of Hell.

319
00:37:27,749 --> 00:37:29,741
That's very interesting.

320
00:38:04,953 --> 00:38:07,491
I didn't know we was takin' on captives.

321
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:10,866
She's invoked the right of parley
with Captain Barbossa.

322
00:38:10,959 --> 00:38:14,577
- I am here to...
- You will speak when spoken to.

323
00:38:15,588 --> 00:38:20,630
And ye will not lay a hand on those
under the protection of parley.

324
00:38:20,718 --> 00:38:22,628
Aye, sir.

325
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:27,556
My apologies, miss.

326
00:38:27,642 --> 00:38:33,431
Captain Barbossa... I am here to
negotiate the cessation of hostilities.

327
00:38:34,232 --> 00:38:38,894
There are a lot of long words there.
We're naught but humble pirates.

328
00:38:39,654 --> 00:38:43,817
- What is it you want?
- Leave and never come back.

329
00:38:46,035 --> 00:38:49,985
I'm disinclined to acquiesce
to your request.

330
00:38:50,206 --> 00:38:52,578
Means "no."

331
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,249
Very well.

332
00:38:57,672 --> 00:38:59,665
I'll drop it.

333
00:39:03,678 --> 00:39:08,387
Me holds are burstin' with swag.
That bit of shine matters to us?

334
00:39:08,725 --> 00:39:10,516
Why?

335
00:39:10,602 --> 00:39:14,516
It's what you've been searching for.
I recognise the ship.

336
00:39:14,606 --> 00:39:17,523
I saw it eight years ago
on the crossing from England!

337
00:39:17,609 --> 00:39:19,685
Did you now?

338
00:39:21,779 --> 00:39:27,485
Fine. I suppose if it is worthless
there's no point in me keeping it.

339
00:39:27,577 --> 00:39:29,285
No!

340
00:39:39,547 --> 00:39:41,623
You have a name, missy?

341
00:39:42,759 --> 00:39:48,429
Elizabeth... Turner. I'm a maid
in the Governor's household.

342
00:39:51,726 --> 00:39:53,719
Miss Turner!

343
00:39:54,395 --> 00:39:57,065
- Turner!
- Bootstrap!

344
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:06,318
How does a maid come to own
that trinket? Family heirloom?

345
00:40:07,283 --> 00:40:10,284
I didn't steal it,
if that's what you mean.

346
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:14,783
You hand it over
and we'll leave and never return.

347
00:40:28,763 --> 00:40:30,756
Our bargain?

348
00:40:32,767 --> 00:40:37,762
Still the guns and stow them. Signal
the men and make good to clear port.

349
00:40:37,855 --> 00:40:40,691
You have to take me to shore.
According to the Code...

350
00:40:40,775 --> 00:40:42,435
First...

351
00:40:42,527 --> 00:40:46,690
Your return to shore was not part of
our negotiations so I must do nothing.

352
00:40:46,781 --> 00:40:50,945
Secondly, you must be a pirate for the
Pirate's Code to apply, and you're not.

353
00:40:51,035 --> 00:40:56,374
Thirdly, the code is more what
you'd call guidelines than actual rules.

354
00:40:56,457 --> 00:40:59,992
Welcome aboard the Black Pearl,
Miss Turner.

355
00:41:20,773 --> 00:41:23,181
They've taken Elizabeth!

356
00:41:23,276 --> 00:41:26,111
Mr Murtogg, remove this man.

357
00:41:26,487 --> 00:41:29,192
We have to hunt them down.
We must save her.

358
00:41:29,282 --> 00:41:31,820
Where do you propose we start?

359
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:36,453
If you have any information
concerning my daughter, share it.

360
00:41:37,874 --> 00:41:41,788
That Jack Sparrow.
He talked about the Black Pearl.

361
00:41:42,045 --> 00:41:44,880
Mentioned it is more what he did.

362
00:41:45,632 --> 00:41:48,419
Ask him where it is!
He could lead us to it.

363
00:41:48,718 --> 00:41:50,212
No.

364
00:41:50,303 --> 00:41:56,222
The pirates left Sparrow in his cell,
ergo they are not his allies.

365
00:41:56,726 --> 00:41:59,680
We will establish their
most likely course...

366
00:41:59,771 --> 00:42:02,143
That's not good enough!

367
00:42:02,232 --> 00:42:09,444
Mr Turner, you are not a military man
or a sailor. You are a blacksmith.

368
00:42:09,822 --> 00:42:13,488
And this is not the moment
for rash actions!

369
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:20,494
Do not think you are the only man here
who cares for Elizabeth.

370
00:42:25,171 --> 00:42:26,749
Please.

371
00:42:31,386 --> 00:42:33,674
- You! Sparrow!
- Aye?

372
00:42:34,013 --> 00:42:36,683
You are familiar with
the Black Pearl?

373
00:42:36,766 --> 00:42:39,222
- I've heard of it.
- Where does it make berth?

374
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:43,474
Where does it make berth?
Have you not heard the stories?

375
00:42:45,233 --> 00:42:51,603
Captain Barbossa and his crew of
miscreants sail from the Isla de Muerta.

376
00:42:51,698 --> 00:42:57,701
It's an island that cannot be found,
except by those who know where it is.

377
00:42:57,787 --> 00:43:02,994
The ship's real, therefore its anchorage
must be a real place. Where?

378
00:43:04,002 --> 00:43:07,287
- Why ask me?
- Because you're a pirate.

379
00:43:07,505 --> 00:43:11,040
You want to turn pirate yourself.
Is that it?

380
00:43:11,509 --> 00:43:13,502
Never!

381
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:19,632
- They took Miss Swann.
- So it is that you found a girl!

382
00:43:19,851 --> 00:43:21,594
I see!

383
00:43:21,686 --> 00:43:24,806
If you intend to brave all,
hasten to her rescue,

384
00:43:24,898 --> 00:43:29,227
and so, win fair lady's heart,
you'll have to do it alone, mate.

385
00:43:29,319 --> 00:43:32,320
I see no profit in it for me.

386
00:43:32,447 --> 00:43:35,234
- I can get you out of here.
- The key's run off.

387
00:43:35,491 --> 00:43:39,904
I helped build these cells.
These are half-pin barrel hinges.

388
00:43:41,247 --> 00:43:46,871
With leverage and the proper application
of strength, the door will lift free.

389
00:43:49,505 --> 00:43:52,672
- What's your name?
- Will Turner.

390
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:57,545
That would be short for William,
I imagine. Good, strong name.

391
00:43:58,556 --> 00:44:01,557
No doubt named for your father.

392
00:44:02,352 --> 00:44:04,309
Yes.

393
00:44:06,189 --> 00:44:09,355
Mr Turner, I've changed me mind.

394
00:44:09,442 --> 00:44:12,443
If you spring me from here,
I swear, on pain of death,

395
00:44:12,528 --> 00:44:16,443
I shall take you to the Black Pearl,
and your bonny lass.

396
00:44:16,532 --> 00:44:19,106
Do we have an accord?

397
00:44:22,038 --> 00:44:25,074
- Agreed.
- Agreed! Get me out!

398
00:44:28,586 --> 00:44:32,121
- Hurry! Someone will have heard that.
- Not without my effects.

399
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,838
We're going to steal a ship?

400
00:44:42,141 --> 00:44:44,846
- That ship?
- Commandeer.

401
00:44:44,936 --> 00:44:48,387
We're going to "commandeer" that ship.
Nautical term.

402
00:44:49,399 --> 00:44:52,981
One question about your business,
or there's no use going.

403
00:44:53,069 --> 00:44:56,936
This girl, how far are you willing to go
to save her?

404
00:44:57,031 --> 00:45:01,777
- I'd die for her.
- Good. No worries then.

405
00:45:20,805 --> 00:45:23,296
This is either madness or brilliance.

406
00:45:24,142 --> 00:45:27,760
It's remarkable how often
those two traits coincide.

407
00:45:57,467 --> 00:46:01,299
Everyone stay calm!
We're taking over the ship.

408
00:46:01,387 --> 00:46:03,427
Aye! Avast!

409
00:46:06,351 --> 00:46:11,309
This ship cannot be crewed by two men.
You'll never make it out of the bay.

410
00:46:12,357 --> 00:46:16,437
Son... I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

411
00:46:16,986 --> 00:46:18,528
Savvy?

412
00:46:22,033 --> 00:46:25,319
- Commodore!
- They're taking the Dauntless!

413
00:46:27,372 --> 00:46:30,871
Commodore! They've taken the ship!

414
00:46:30,959 --> 00:46:34,244
Sparrow and Turner!
They're taking the Dauntless!

415
00:46:34,337 --> 00:46:37,373
Rash, Turner. Too rash.

416
00:46:38,967 --> 00:46:43,178
That is, without doubt, the worst pirate
I have ever seen.

417
00:46:46,474 --> 00:46:48,680
Here they come.

418
00:46:52,563 --> 00:46:54,852
Bring her around!

419
00:47:01,447 --> 00:47:04,401
Search every cabin, every hold,
down to the bilges.

420
00:47:20,675 --> 00:47:23,296
Sailors, back to the Interceptor!

421
00:47:29,392 --> 00:47:33,259
Thank you, Commodore,
for getting us ready to make way.

422
00:47:33,354 --> 00:47:35,976
We'd have had
a hard time by ourselves.

423
00:47:39,193 --> 00:47:41,519
Set topsails and clear up this mess.

424
00:47:41,613 --> 00:47:43,985
With this wind we won't catch them.

425
00:47:44,073 --> 00:47:47,240
I don't need to. Get them in range
of the long nines.

426
00:47:47,327 --> 00:47:50,446
Run out the guns!

427
00:47:50,538 --> 00:47:53,112
We are to fire on our own ship, sir?

428
00:47:53,207 --> 00:47:58,202
I'd rather see her at the bottom of the
ocean than in the hands of a pirate.

429
00:47:58,379 --> 00:48:01,795
Commodore!
He's disabled the rudder chain.

430
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:07,509
Abandon ship!

431
00:48:13,853 --> 00:48:17,187
That's got to be the best pirate
I've ever seen.

432
00:48:17,523 --> 00:48:19,979
So it would seem.

433
00:48:28,701 --> 00:48:32,533
When I was a lad living in England,
my mother raised me by herself.

434
00:48:32,622 --> 00:48:36,536
After she died, I came here,
looking for my father.

435
00:48:38,002 --> 00:48:40,042
Is that so?

436
00:48:40,838 --> 00:48:43,923
My father, Bill Turner?

437
00:48:44,008 --> 00:48:47,009
It was only after you learned my name
you agreed to help.

438
00:48:47,095 --> 00:48:49,882
Since that's what I wanted,
I didn't press the matter.

439
00:48:49,973 --> 00:48:53,472
I'm not a simpleton.
You knew my father.

440
00:48:59,649 --> 00:49:04,062
I knew him. Probably one of the few
who knew him as William Turner.

441
00:49:04,153 --> 00:49:07,273
Everyone else just called him
"Bootstrap".

442
00:49:07,365 --> 00:49:09,274
Bootstrap?

443
00:49:09,367 --> 00:49:13,828
Good man. Good pirate.
I swear, you look just like him.

444
00:49:14,038 --> 00:49:19,115
It's not true. He was a merchant sailor.
A respectable man who obeyed the law.

445
00:49:19,335 --> 00:49:22,420
He was a bloody pirate, a scallywag.

446
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,632
My father was not a pirate!

447
00:49:26,801 --> 00:49:30,633
Put it away, son.
It's not worth you getting beat again.

448
00:49:30,888 --> 00:49:35,218
You ignored the rules of engagement.
In a fair fight, I'd kill you.

449
00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:38,310
That's not much incentive
for me to fight fair, is it?

450
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:48,855
As long as you're just
hanging there, pay attention.

451
00:49:48,948 --> 00:49:51,735
The only rules that matter are these:

452
00:49:51,826 --> 00:49:55,277
What a man can do
and what a man can't do.

453
00:49:55,997 --> 00:50:01,501
You can accept your father was a
pirate and a good man, or you can't.

454
00:50:01,586 --> 00:50:05,915
Pirate is in your blood, so you'll
have to square with that someday.

455
00:50:06,007 --> 00:50:08,545
Me, for example,
I can let you drown,

456
00:50:08,635 --> 00:50:13,131
but I can't bring this ship into Tortuga
all by me onesies, savvy?

457
00:50:13,348 --> 00:50:15,008
So.

458
00:50:19,062 --> 00:50:22,395
Can you sail under the command
of a pirate?

459
00:50:23,691 --> 00:50:25,684
Or can you not?

460
00:50:27,737 --> 00:50:29,445
Tortuga?

461
00:50:29,572 --> 00:50:30,983
Tortuga.

462
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:56,849
It is a sad life
that has never breathed deep

463
00:50:56,933 --> 00:51:00,384
the sweet, proliferous bouquet
that is Tortuga. Savvy?

464
00:51:02,105 --> 00:51:03,978
What do you think?

465
00:51:07,527 --> 00:51:10,232
- It'll linger.
- I'll tell you, mate,

466
00:51:10,446 --> 00:51:16,200
if every town were like this one,
no man would ever feel unwanted.

467
00:51:16,953 --> 00:51:19,159
Scarlett!

468
00:51:20,248 --> 00:51:21,416
Not sure I deserved that.

469
00:51:21,416 --> 00:51:22,411
Not sure I deserved that.

470
00:51:23,334 --> 00:51:23,835
Giselle.

471
00:51:23,835 --> 00:51:24,617
Giselle.

472
00:51:24,711 --> 00:51:26,419
- Who was she?
- What?

473
00:51:28,256 --> 00:51:30,083
I may have deserved that.

474
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:35,511
Curse you for breathing,
you slack-jawed idiot!

475
00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:40,092
Mother's love!

476
00:51:40,184 --> 00:51:41,892
Jack!

477
00:51:42,186 --> 00:51:45,306
You should know not to wake a man
when he's sleepin'.

478
00:51:45,398 --> 00:51:49,265
- It's bad luck.
- Fortunately, I know how to counter it.

479
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:52,527
The man who did the waking
buys the man who was sleeping a drink.

480
00:51:52,864 --> 00:51:57,739
The man who was sleeping drinks it
while listening to his proposition.

481
00:52:00,038 --> 00:52:02,873
Aye, that'll about do it.

482
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,877
Blast! I'm already awake!

483
00:52:09,213 --> 00:52:11,372
That was for the smell.

484
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:23,093
Keep a sharp eye.

485
00:52:30,193 --> 00:52:30,443
Now, what's the nature
of this venture of your'n?

486
00:52:30,443 --> 00:52:33,563
Now, what's the nature
of this venture of your'n?

487
00:52:34,822 --> 00:52:36,981
I'm going after the Black Pearl.

488
00:52:40,745 --> 00:52:44,079
I know where it's going to be,
and I'm gonna take it.

489
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:48,501
Jack, it's a fool's errand.

490
00:52:48,586 --> 00:52:51,872
You know better than me
the tales of the Black Pearl.

491
00:52:51,965 --> 00:52:55,001
That's why I know
what Barbossa is up to.

492
00:52:55,093 --> 00:52:57,335
All I need is a crew.

493
00:52:57,428 --> 00:53:02,304
Captain Barbossa is not a man to suffer
fools nor strike a bargain with one.

494
00:53:02,392 --> 00:53:04,633
It's a good thing I'm not a fool, then.

495
00:53:04,727 --> 00:53:09,769
Prove me wrong. What makes you think
Barbossa will give up his ship to you?

496
00:53:09,857 --> 00:53:13,191
Let's just say it's a matter
of leverage.

497
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:31,453
The kid?

498
00:53:32,046 --> 00:53:35,047
That is the child
of Bootstrap Bill Turner.

499
00:53:36,134 --> 00:53:38,589
His only child. Savvy?

500
00:53:38,761 --> 00:53:41,252
Is he now?

501
00:53:43,558 --> 00:53:45,930
Leverage, says you.

502
00:53:46,019 --> 00:53:49,055
I feel a change in the wind, says I.

503
00:53:49,147 --> 00:53:53,358
I'll find us a crew. There's bound to be
some sailors on this rock crazy as you.

504
00:53:53,526 --> 00:53:55,815
One can only hope.

505
00:53:55,903 --> 00:53:56,988
- Take what you can!
- Give nothin' back!

506
00:53:56,988 --> 00:53:58,696
- Take what you can!
- Give nothin' back!

507
00:54:23,431 --> 00:54:27,678
You'll be dining with the captain,
and he requests you wear this.

508
00:54:28,686 --> 00:54:32,221
Tell him that I am disinclined
to acquiesce to his request.

509
00:54:33,358 --> 00:54:35,599
He said you'd say that.

510
00:54:35,693 --> 00:54:40,154
He also said if that be the case,
you'll be dining with the crew.

511
00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:43,240
And you'll be naked.

512
00:54:48,248 --> 00:54:49,362
Fine.

513
00:55:06,099 --> 00:55:09,681
There's no need to stand on ceremony,
no call to impress anyone.

514
00:55:10,728 --> 00:55:13,219
You must be hungry.

515
00:55:29,539 --> 00:55:31,531
Try the wine.

516
00:55:35,628 --> 00:55:38,629
And the apples. One of those next.

517
00:55:46,889 --> 00:55:49,427
It's poisoned.

518
00:55:50,101 --> 00:55:52,307
There would be no sense
to be killing you.

519
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:56,518
Then release me. You have your trinket.
I'm of no further value to you.

520
00:55:59,986 --> 00:56:03,569
You don't know what this is, do you?

521
00:56:03,656 --> 00:56:05,649
It's a pirate medallion.

522
00:56:05,908 --> 00:56:08,826
This is Aztec gold.

523
00:56:08,911 --> 00:56:14,914
One of 882 identical pieces they
delivered in a stone chest to Cortés.

524
00:56:16,419 --> 00:56:20,006
Blood money paid to stem the slaughter
he wreaked upon them with his armies.

525
00:56:20,006 --> 00:56:21,204
Blood money paid to stem the slaughter
he wreaked upon them with his armies.

526
00:56:21,299 --> 00:56:24,335
But the greed of Cortés was insatiable.

527
00:56:24,636 --> 00:56:28,087
So the heathen gods
placed upon the gold...

528
00:56:29,974 --> 00:56:32,512
a terrible curse.

529
00:56:33,227 --> 00:56:38,435
Any mortal that removes but
a single piece from that stone chest...

530
00:56:38,524 --> 00:56:41,527
shall be punished for eternity.

531
00:56:41,527 --> 00:56:41,894
Shall be punished for eternity.

532
00:56:43,279 --> 00:56:46,731
I hardly believe in ghost stories
any more, Captain Barbossa.

533
00:56:46,824 --> 00:56:47,939
Aye.

534
00:56:48,826 --> 00:56:52,278
That's exactly what I thought
when we were first told the tale.

535
00:56:52,372 --> 00:56:55,373
Buried on an island of the dead
what cannot be found,

536
00:56:55,458 --> 00:56:58,079
except for those who know where it is.

537
00:56:58,878 --> 00:57:00,918
Find it, we did.

538
00:57:01,965 --> 00:57:06,045
There be the chest.
Inside be the gold.

539
00:57:06,135 --> 00:57:08,258
And we took 'em all!

540
00:57:08,638 --> 00:57:10,631
We spent 'em and traded 'em,

541
00:57:10,723 --> 00:57:14,851
and frittered 'em away on drink and food
and pleasurable company.

542
00:57:15,228 --> 00:57:20,435
The more we gave 'em away,
the more we came to realise...

543
00:57:21,276 --> 00:57:24,609
the drink would not satisfy.

544
00:57:24,696 --> 00:57:27,282
Food turned to ash in our mouths,

545
00:57:27,282 --> 00:57:28,361
Food turned to ash in our mouths,

546
00:57:28,449 --> 00:57:33,111
and all the pleasurable company
in the world could not slake our lust.

547
00:57:34,706 --> 00:57:38,039
We are cursed men, Miss Turner.

548
00:57:39,210 --> 00:57:42,413
Compelled by greed we were, but now...

549
00:57:42,505 --> 00:57:44,961
we are consumed by it.

550
00:57:56,144 --> 00:58:00,438
There is one way we can end our curse.

551
00:58:03,234 --> 00:58:07,861
All the scattered pieces
of the Aztec gold must be restored,

552
00:58:07,947 --> 00:58:09,940
and the blood repaid.

553
00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:16,529
Thanks to ye, we have the final piece.

554
00:58:18,541 --> 00:58:20,747
And the blood to be repaid?

555
00:58:20,918 --> 00:58:24,418
That's why there's no sense
to be killing you.

556
00:58:24,505 --> 00:58:26,463
Yet.

557
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:29,791
Apple?

558
00:58:45,652 --> 00:58:49,649
I'm curious. After killing me,
what are you planning on doing next?

559
00:59:54,095 --> 00:59:55,340
Look!

560
00:59:55,430 --> 00:59:58,596
The moonlight shows us
for what we really are.

561
00:59:59,392 --> 01:00:02,353
We are not among the living
and so we cannot die.

562
01:00:02,353 --> 01:00:02,601
We are not among the living
and so we cannot die.

563
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:04,514
But neither are we dead.

564
01:00:05,648 --> 01:00:09,432
For too long I've been parched of thirst
and unable to quench it.

565
01:00:09,527 --> 01:00:13,448
Too long I've been starvin' to death
and haven't died.

566
01:00:13,448 --> 01:00:14,527
Too long I've been starvin' to death
and haven't died.

567
01:00:14,616 --> 01:00:16,738
I feel nothing.

568
01:00:16,826 --> 01:00:19,744
Not the wind on my face,
nor the spray of the sea...

569
01:00:21,164 --> 01:00:23,655
nor the warmth of a woman's flesh.

570
01:00:24,375 --> 01:00:28,836
You best start believing
in ghost stories, Miss Turner.

571
01:00:28,921 --> 01:00:30,831
You're in one!

572
01:00:48,733 --> 01:00:51,105
What are you looking at?
Back to work!

573
01:00:51,194 --> 01:00:54,230
You heard the captain.
Back to work.

574
01:00:59,953 --> 01:01:04,661
Feast your eyes, Captain. All of them,
faithful hands before the mast.

575
01:01:04,749 --> 01:01:07,833
Every man worth his salt,

576
01:01:08,044 --> 01:01:09,918
and crazy to boot.

577
01:01:10,129 --> 01:01:13,000
So this is your able-bodied crew?

578
01:01:19,305 --> 01:01:21,262
- You, sailor!
- Cotton, sir.

579
01:01:21,349 --> 01:01:24,848
Mr Cotton, do you have the courage
and fortitude to follow orders

580
01:01:24,936 --> 01:01:27,972
and stay true in the face of danger
and almost certain death?

581
01:01:28,481 --> 01:01:32,561
- Mr Cotton. Answer, man!
- He's a mute, sir.

582
01:01:32,652 --> 01:01:36,899
Poor devil had his tongue cut out, so
he trained the parrot to talk for him.

583
01:01:36,990 --> 01:01:39,029
No one's yet figured how.

584
01:01:41,703 --> 01:01:45,652
Mr Cotton's parrot,
same question.

585
01:01:45,873 --> 01:01:49,242
Wind in your sails!
Wind in your sails!

586
01:01:49,752 --> 01:01:52,160
Mostly, we figure that means "yes".

587
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:54,497
Of course it does. Satisfied?

588
01:01:55,466 --> 01:01:57,459
Well, you've proved they're mad.

589
01:01:57,552 --> 01:01:59,924
What's the benefit for us?

590
01:02:09,981 --> 01:02:11,060
Anamaria!

591
01:02:13,526 --> 01:02:17,394
- I suppose you didn't deserve that.
- No, that one I deserved.

592
01:02:17,488 --> 01:02:20,359
- You stole my boat!
- Actually...

593
01:02:22,452 --> 01:02:27,529
Borrowed without permission, but with
every intention of bringing it back.

594
01:02:27,624 --> 01:02:30,411
- But you didn't!
- You'll get another one.

595
01:02:32,170 --> 01:02:34,162
- I will.
- A better one.

596
01:02:34,255 --> 01:02:36,082
A better one!

597
01:02:36,174 --> 01:02:38,462
- That one.
- What one?

598
01:02:40,303 --> 01:02:41,963
That one?

599
01:02:45,016 --> 01:02:46,724
Aye. That one.

600
01:02:46,809 --> 01:02:48,352
- What say you?
- Aye!

601
01:02:48,436 --> 01:02:49,811
Aye!

602
01:02:49,896 --> 01:02:51,888
Anchor's aweigh!

603
01:02:51,981 --> 01:02:56,109
No, it's frightful bad luck
to bring a woman aboard, sir.

604
01:02:56,194 --> 01:02:58,483
It'll be far worse not to have her.

605
01:03:32,313 --> 01:03:35,682
How can we sail to an island
that nobody can find,

606
01:03:35,775 --> 01:03:37,981
with a compass that doesn't work?

607
01:03:38,069 --> 01:03:42,814
The compass doesn't point north, but
we're not trying to find north, are we?

608
01:03:53,501 --> 01:03:55,909
We should drop canvas, sir.

609
01:03:56,004 --> 01:03:58,043
She can hold a bit longer.

610
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:03,882
What's in your head as puts you
in such a fine mood, Cap'n?

611
01:04:03,970 --> 01:04:05,630
We're catching up.

612
01:04:20,695 --> 01:04:22,734
Time to go, poppet.

613
01:05:18,378 --> 01:05:22,790
Dead men tell no tales.

614
01:05:25,343 --> 01:05:29,921
Chills the bones, how many honest
sailors been claimed by this passage.

615
01:05:45,363 --> 01:05:47,735
How is it that Jack
came by that compass?

616
01:05:47,824 --> 01:05:50,908
Not a lot's known about Jack Sparrow
before he came to Tortuga

617
01:05:50,994 --> 01:05:53,663
with a mind to find the treasure
of the Isla de Muerta.

618
01:05:53,871 --> 01:05:57,205
That was before I'd met him, when he
was captain of the Black Pearl.

619
01:05:58,084 --> 01:05:59,115
What?

620
01:06:03,006 --> 01:06:06,790
- He failed to mention that.
- He plays things close to the vest now.

621
01:06:06,884 --> 01:06:09,091
And a hard-learned lesson it was.

622
01:06:09,178 --> 01:06:13,675
Three days into the trip, the first mate
says, "Everything's an equal share."

623
01:06:13,766 --> 01:06:18,512
"The location of the treasure, too."
So Jack gives up the bearings.

624
01:06:18,605 --> 01:06:21,890
That night, there was a mutiny.

625
01:06:21,983 --> 01:06:25,067
They marooned Jack on an island
and left him to die.

626
01:06:25,153 --> 01:06:28,486
But not before he'd
gone mad with the heat.

627
01:06:31,492 --> 01:06:33,651
So that's the reason for all the...

628
01:06:35,955 --> 01:06:38,493
Reason's got nothing to do with it.

629
01:06:38,583 --> 01:06:44,039
When a pirate's marooned, he's given
a pistol with a single shot. One shot.

630
01:06:44,130 --> 01:06:47,001
That won't do much good hunting,
nor to be rescued.

631
01:06:47,091 --> 01:06:50,756
But after three weeks
of a starving belly and thirst,

632
01:06:50,845 --> 01:06:53,846
that pistol looks real friendly.

633
01:06:53,932 --> 01:06:57,217
But Jack escaped the island,
and still has that single shot.

634
01:06:57,310 --> 01:07:00,845
He won't use it, though,
save on one man.

635
01:07:00,939 --> 01:07:02,978
His mutinous first mate.

636
01:07:03,066 --> 01:07:05,058
- Barbossa.
- Aye.

637
01:07:06,319 --> 01:07:09,652
- How did Jack get off the island?
- I'll tell ye.

638
01:07:09,739 --> 01:07:14,068
He waded out into the shallows,
and waited three days and three nights,

639
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:18,905
till all manner of sea creatures
became acclimated to his presence.

640
01:07:18,998 --> 01:07:22,830
On the fourth morning,
he roped a couple of sea turtles,

641
01:07:22,919 --> 01:07:25,291
lashed them together
and made a raft.

642
01:07:27,006 --> 01:07:30,790
- He roped a couple of sea turtles.
- Aye.

643
01:07:33,054 --> 01:07:35,379
What did he use for rope?

644
01:07:40,645 --> 01:07:42,887
Human hair.

645
01:07:42,981 --> 01:07:45,472
From my back.

646
01:07:45,566 --> 01:07:49,018
- Let go the anchor!
- Lower the anchor line!

647
01:07:49,112 --> 01:07:51,489
Young Mr Turner and I are to go ashore.

648
01:07:52,156 --> 01:07:53,271
Captain.

649
01:07:53,366 --> 01:07:55,904
What if the worst should happen?

650
01:07:55,994 --> 01:07:59,279
- Keep to the Code.
- Aye. The Code.

651
01:08:25,648 --> 01:08:30,191
- Ten years of hoarding swag.
- Now we finally get to spend it.

652
01:08:37,327 --> 01:08:40,114
Once we're quit of the curse,
we'll be rich men...

653
01:08:40,872 --> 01:08:44,537
and you can buy an eye
that fits and is made of glass.

654
01:08:44,626 --> 01:08:47,580
This one does splinter
something terrible.

655
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:50,622
Stop rubbing it.

656
01:09:09,567 --> 01:09:12,568
What code is Gibbs to keep to
if the worst should happen?

657
01:09:12,654 --> 01:09:14,942
Pirates' Code.

658
01:09:15,031 --> 01:09:18,863
Any man who falls behind
is left behind.

659
01:09:20,161 --> 01:09:22,486
No heroes amongst thieves.

660
01:09:23,873 --> 01:09:26,115
For having such a bleak outlook
on pirates

661
01:09:26,292 --> 01:09:28,664
you're well on your way
to becoming one.

662
01:09:29,712 --> 01:09:32,583
Sprung a man from jail,

663
01:09:32,674 --> 01:09:35,081
commandeered a ship of the fleet,

664
01:09:35,176 --> 01:09:37,881
sailed with a buccaneer crew
out of Tortuga...

665
01:09:39,931 --> 01:09:42,967
and you're completely obsessed
with treasure.

666
01:09:45,937 --> 01:09:49,520
That's not true. I am not obsessed
with treasure.

667
01:09:56,739 --> 01:09:59,444
Not all treasure is silver
and gold, mate.

668
01:09:59,534 --> 01:10:02,618
Gentlemen, the time has come!

669
01:10:02,704 --> 01:10:05,277
Salvation is nigh!

670
01:10:06,416 --> 01:10:09,867
- Our torment is nearing an end!
- Elizabeth.

671
01:10:10,336 --> 01:10:12,495
For ten years
we've been tested and tried

672
01:10:12,588 --> 01:10:17,831
and each man here has proved his mettle
a hundred times over

673
01:10:17,927 --> 01:10:20,252
and a hundred times again!

674
01:10:22,015 --> 01:10:24,553
Suffered, I have!

675
01:10:24,642 --> 01:10:31,179
Punished we were, the lot of us,
disproportionate to our crime!

676
01:10:33,109 --> 01:10:34,817
Here it is!

677
01:10:38,239 --> 01:10:41,655
The cursed treasure of Cortés himself.

678
01:10:43,661 --> 01:10:47,991
Every last piece that went astray,
we have returned.

679
01:10:48,833 --> 01:10:50,375
Save for this!

680
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:53,330
- Jack!
- Not yet.

681
01:10:54,047 --> 01:10:56,288
We wait for the opportune moment.

682
01:10:59,469 --> 01:11:04,095
When's that? When it's of greatest
profit to you?

683
01:11:04,182 --> 01:11:06,803
May I ask you something?

684
01:11:06,893 --> 01:11:09,384
Have I ever given you reason
not to trust me?

685
01:11:10,605 --> 01:11:15,848
Do us a favour. I know it's difficult
for you, but please stay here.

686
01:11:15,944 --> 01:11:18,269
And try not to do anything stupid.

687
01:11:21,491 --> 01:11:25,441
Who among us has paid the blood
sacrifice owed to the heathen gods?

688
01:11:25,536 --> 01:11:29,237
- Us!
- And whose blood must yet be paid?

689
01:11:29,332 --> 01:11:30,992
Hers!

690
01:11:33,211 --> 01:11:37,789
You know the first thing I'm going to do
after the curse is lifted?

691
01:11:40,134 --> 01:11:43,468
Eat a whole bushel of apples!

692
01:11:51,312 --> 01:11:53,305
Begun by blood.

693
01:11:53,398 --> 01:11:55,390
By blood undone.

694
01:11:59,654 --> 01:12:03,402
Sorry, Jack.
I'm not going to be your leverage.

695
01:12:12,625 --> 01:12:15,033
That's it?

696
01:12:15,128 --> 01:12:16,622
Waste not.

697
01:12:54,584 --> 01:12:55,829
Did it work?

698
01:12:55,918 --> 01:12:58,836
- I don't feel no different.
- How do we tell?

699
01:13:05,970 --> 01:13:08,461
You're not dead!

700
01:13:08,556 --> 01:13:10,098
No.

701
01:13:11,684 --> 01:13:14,009
- He shot me.
- It didn't work.

702
01:13:14,103 --> 01:13:16,641
The curse is still upon us!

703
01:13:21,152 --> 01:13:23,608
You! Maid! Your father,
what was his name?

704
01:13:23,696 --> 01:13:25,938
Was your father William Turner?

705
01:13:26,658 --> 01:13:27,737
No.

706
01:13:27,825 --> 01:13:31,159
Where's his child who sailed
from England eight years ago?

707
01:13:31,245 --> 01:13:34,864
The child in whose veins flows
the blood of William Turner? Where?

708
01:13:41,923 --> 01:13:46,300
You two!
You brought us the wrong person!

709
01:13:47,553 --> 01:13:48,929
No!

710
01:13:49,013 --> 01:13:51,848
She had the medallion.
She's the proper age.

711
01:13:51,933 --> 01:13:55,053
She said her name was Turner.
You heard her.

712
01:13:56,312 --> 01:13:58,684
I think she lied to us.

713
01:14:00,108 --> 01:14:02,433
You brought us here for nothing.

714
01:14:02,527 --> 01:14:06,607
I won't take questioning,
not from the likes of you, Master Twigg.

715
01:14:06,698 --> 01:14:10,945
Who's to blame him? Your decisions
have led us from bad to worse!

716
01:14:13,204 --> 01:14:15,742
It was you who sent Bootstrap
to the depths!

717
01:14:19,711 --> 01:14:22,249
And it's you who brought us here
in the first place!

718
01:14:24,132 --> 01:14:28,176
If any coward here dare challenge me,
let him speak!

719
01:14:28,928 --> 01:14:33,637
I say we cut her throat
and spill all her blood. Just in case.

720
01:14:33,725 --> 01:14:35,183
Yeah!

721
01:14:43,818 --> 01:14:46,772
The medallion! She's taken it!

722
01:14:46,946 --> 01:14:50,647
Get after her, you feckless pack
of ingrates!

723
01:14:56,623 --> 01:14:59,327
- Where are the oars?
- There's no oars!

724
01:14:59,417 --> 01:15:02,334
The oars have gone missing!
Find them!

725
01:15:11,429 --> 01:15:12,923
You!

726
01:15:14,474 --> 01:15:17,475
- You're supposed to be dead.
- Am I not?

727
01:15:27,737 --> 01:15:29,730
Pearlie...

728
01:15:30,406 --> 01:15:32,648
Palu-li-la-la-lulu...

729
01:15:35,370 --> 01:15:37,196
Parlili...

730
01:15:37,288 --> 01:15:39,826
Parsnip... Parsley...

731
01:15:39,916 --> 01:15:42,158
Partner...

732
01:15:42,251 --> 01:15:44,789
- Parley?
- That's the one! Parley!

733
01:15:45,380 --> 01:15:46,494
Parley!

734
01:15:46,589 --> 01:15:48,498
Parley?

735
01:15:49,133 --> 01:15:52,965
Damn to the depths whatever muttonhead
thought of parley!

736
01:15:54,347 --> 01:15:56,340
That would be the French.

737
01:16:08,736 --> 01:16:11,654
- Not more pirates.
- Welcome aboard, Miss Elizabeth.

738
01:16:13,032 --> 01:16:14,111
Mr Gibbs?

739
01:16:14,951 --> 01:16:17,240
Hey, boy, where be Jack?

740
01:16:17,328 --> 01:16:19,819
Jack Sparrow?

741
01:16:21,624 --> 01:16:23,617
He fell behind.

742
01:16:30,174 --> 01:16:32,879
Keep to the Code.

743
01:16:32,969 --> 01:16:35,756
Weigh anchor! Hoist the sails!

744
01:16:35,847 --> 01:16:37,839
Split-quick, you dibbies!

745
01:16:43,688 --> 01:16:46,642
How the blazes did you get
off that island?

746
01:16:48,192 --> 01:16:51,608
When you marooned me
on that godforsaken spit of land,

747
01:16:51,696 --> 01:16:54,068
you forgot one very important thing.

748
01:16:55,992 --> 01:16:57,984
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

749
01:16:58,578 --> 01:17:02,872
Well, I won't be making
that mistake again.

750
01:17:03,875 --> 01:17:07,374
Gents, you all remember
Captain Jack Sparrow?

751
01:17:07,462 --> 01:17:09,122
Aye.

752
01:17:09,213 --> 01:17:11,289
Kill him.

753
01:17:11,633 --> 01:17:14,836
The girl's blood didn't work, did it?

754
01:17:16,679 --> 01:17:18,719
Hold your fire!

755
01:17:24,479 --> 01:17:27,052
You know whose blood we need.

756
01:17:28,775 --> 01:17:31,444
I know whose blood you need.

757
01:17:37,784 --> 01:17:40,357
What sort of a man
trades a man's life for a ship?

758
01:17:40,453 --> 01:17:42,446
A pirate.

759
01:17:42,872 --> 01:17:45,992
Here. Let me.

760
01:17:46,084 --> 01:17:48,076
Thank you.

761
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:52,419
You said you gave Barbossa
my name as yours.

762
01:17:53,675 --> 01:17:55,667
Why?

763
01:17:57,762 --> 01:17:59,755
I don't know.

764
01:18:00,223 --> 01:18:03,259
I'm sorry. A blacksmith's hands.

765
01:18:03,351 --> 01:18:07,894
- They're rough.
- No. I mean, yes, they are, but...

766
01:18:11,234 --> 01:18:13,310
Don't stop.

767
01:18:20,702 --> 01:18:22,112
Elizabeth.

768
01:18:38,052 --> 01:18:40,045
It's yours.

769
01:18:43,766 --> 01:18:47,182
I thought I'd lost it
the day they rescued me.

770
01:18:47,270 --> 01:18:50,721
It was a gift from my father.
He sent it to me.

771
01:18:56,988 --> 01:18:59,027
Why did you take it?

772
01:19:00,241 --> 01:19:02,815
Because I was afraid
that you were a pirate.

773
01:19:04,621 --> 01:19:06,613
That would've been awful.

774
01:19:09,876 --> 01:19:13,079
It wasn't your blood they needed.

775
01:19:15,506 --> 01:19:17,499
It was my father's blood.

776
01:19:19,218 --> 01:19:21,544
My blood.

777
01:19:26,476 --> 01:19:30,058
- The blood of a pirate.
- Will, I'm so sorry. Please forgive me.

778
01:19:43,409 --> 01:19:45,568
So you expect to leave me on some beach

779
01:19:45,662 --> 01:19:48,662
with nothing but a name
and your word it's the one I need,

780
01:19:48,748 --> 01:19:52,449
and watch you
sail away in my ship.

781
01:19:52,543 --> 01:19:53,706
No.

782
01:19:53,795 --> 01:19:57,923
I expect to leave you standing on some
beach with absolutely no name at all,

783
01:19:58,007 --> 01:20:03,049
watching me sail away on my ship, and
then I'll shout the name back to you.

784
01:20:03,137 --> 01:20:04,382
Savvy?

785
01:20:04,472 --> 01:20:07,224
But that still leaves me
standing on some beach,

786
01:20:07,308 --> 01:20:11,436
with naught but a name and
your word it's the one I need.

787
01:20:12,522 --> 01:20:17,729
Of the two of us, I am the only one
who hasn't committed mutiny.

788
01:20:17,819 --> 01:20:21,768
Therefore, my word
is the one we'll be trusting.

789
01:20:21,864 --> 01:20:26,407
Although, I suppose I should be
thanking you because, in fact,

790
01:20:26,494 --> 01:20:29,614
if you hadn't betrayed me
and left me to die,

791
01:20:29,706 --> 01:20:34,414
I would have an equal share
in that curse, same as you.

792
01:20:34,502 --> 01:20:36,827
Funny old world, isn't it?

793
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:41,962
Captain! We're coming up
on the Interceptor.

794
01:20:55,148 --> 01:20:57,140
I'm having a thought here, Barbossa.

795
01:20:57,817 --> 01:21:01,518
What say we run up a flag of truce,
I scurry over to the Interceptor,

796
01:21:01,612 --> 01:21:04,898
and I negotiate the return
of your medallion?

797
01:21:06,034 --> 01:21:09,568
Now that's exactly the attitude
that lost you the Pearl.

798
01:21:09,662 --> 01:21:12,414
People are easier to search
when they're dead.

799
01:21:13,625 --> 01:21:15,617
Lock him in the brig.

800
01:21:27,764 --> 01:21:29,637
Hands aloft to loose ta'gallants!

801
01:21:29,724 --> 01:21:33,057
With this wind,
she'll carry every sail we've got.

802
01:21:33,144 --> 01:21:36,893
- What's happening?
- The Black Pearl is gaining on us!

803
01:21:41,027 --> 01:21:43,779
This is the fastest ship
in the Caribbean.

804
01:21:43,863 --> 01:21:46,188
Tell them that after they've caught us.

805
01:21:46,866 --> 01:21:49,322
- We're shallower on the draft, right?
- Aye.

806
01:21:49,410 --> 01:21:51,617
Then can't we lose them
on those shoals?

807
01:21:53,247 --> 01:21:56,165
We don't have to outrun 'em long.
Just long enough.

808
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:58,576
Lighten the ship!
Stem to stern!

809
01:21:58,670 --> 01:22:01,836
Anything we can afford to lose,
see that it's lost!

810
01:22:11,224 --> 01:22:13,216
Apparently, there's a leak.

811
01:22:27,949 --> 01:22:31,069
Haul on the main brace!
Make ready the guns!

812
01:22:31,911 --> 01:22:33,904
And run out the sweeps.

813
01:23:01,858 --> 01:23:03,934
We're gonna need that.

814
01:23:12,076 --> 01:23:14,863
It was a good plan, up till now.

815
01:23:14,954 --> 01:23:16,365
Gibbs!

816
01:23:16,456 --> 01:23:20,038
We have to make a stand.
We must fight!

817
01:23:20,251 --> 01:23:22,374
- Load the guns!
- With what?

818
01:23:22,462 --> 01:23:26,044
Anything! Everything!
Anything we have left.

819
01:23:28,051 --> 01:23:30,008
Load the guns!

820
01:23:30,094 --> 01:23:33,463
Case shot and langrage!
Nails and crushed glass!

821
01:23:36,017 --> 01:23:38,010
With a will!

822
01:23:58,539 --> 01:24:01,576
The Pearl will luff up
on our port quarter.

823
01:24:01,668 --> 01:24:04,205
She'll rake us
without presenting a target.

824
01:24:04,295 --> 01:24:06,833
Lower the anchor on the right side.

825
01:24:06,923 --> 01:24:09,212
On the starboard side!

826
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:13,215
- It has the element of surprise.
- You're daft, lady. You both are.

827
01:24:13,513 --> 01:24:15,552
Daft like Jack.

828
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:17,514
Lower the starboard anchor!

829
01:24:17,809 --> 01:24:21,308
Do it, you gobs, or it's you
we'll load into the cannons!

830
01:24:40,289 --> 01:24:42,282
Let go!

831
01:24:47,672 --> 01:24:50,079
They're club hauling.

832
01:24:50,174 --> 01:24:52,416
Hard a port! Rack the starboard oars!

833
01:24:52,510 --> 01:24:54,218
Hard a port!

834
01:25:05,565 --> 01:25:07,557
Keep her steady, man.

835
01:25:13,948 --> 01:25:15,656
- Now!
- Fire!

836
01:25:15,742 --> 01:25:17,699
Fire all!

837
01:25:26,461 --> 01:25:28,453
Stop blowing holes in my ship!

838
01:26:15,134 --> 01:26:18,918
- We need more ideas, lass!
- It's your turn!

839
01:26:19,055 --> 01:26:22,222
- We need us a devil's dowry!
- We'll give them her!

840
01:26:23,434 --> 01:26:25,760
She's not what they're after.

841
01:26:27,313 --> 01:26:28,642
The medallion.

842
01:26:50,420 --> 01:26:53,374
Strike your colours,
you bloomin' cockroaches!

843
01:26:53,464 --> 01:26:56,169
Hands, grapnels at the ready!

844
01:26:56,259 --> 01:26:58,251
Prepare to board!

845
01:27:32,545 --> 01:27:34,834
Pistols and cutlasses, men!

846
01:27:34,922 --> 01:27:37,674
Koehler, Twigg, to the powder magazine!

847
01:27:37,759 --> 01:27:40,878
And the rest of you,
bring me the medallion!

848
01:28:10,667 --> 01:28:11,781
Below!

849
01:28:31,562 --> 01:28:32,642
Thanks very much.

850
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:47,952
Jack!

851
01:28:48,705 --> 01:28:50,163
Bloody empty!

852
01:29:06,514 --> 01:29:08,092
That's not very nice.

853
01:29:12,603 --> 01:29:14,929
- Where is the medallion?
- Wretch!

854
01:29:18,276 --> 01:29:20,565
Where is dear William?

855
01:29:21,529 --> 01:29:22,774
Will.

856
01:29:25,783 --> 01:29:27,242
Elizabeth!

857
01:29:30,663 --> 01:29:32,323
Monkey!

858
01:29:38,004 --> 01:29:39,831
I can't move it!

859
01:29:42,425 --> 01:29:44,382
Elizabeth!

860
01:29:55,605 --> 01:29:59,472
- Thank you, Jack.
- You're welcome.

861
01:29:59,567 --> 01:30:02,141
Not you. We named the monkey Jack.

862
01:30:03,363 --> 01:30:06,363
Gents! Our hope is restored!

863
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:46,358
Any of you so much
as thinks the word "parley",

864
01:30:46,447 --> 01:30:49,199
I'll have your guts for garters!

865
01:30:57,333 --> 01:30:58,496
Will.

866
01:30:59,127 --> 01:31:01,119
You godless pirate!

867
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:03,331
Welcome back, miss.

868
01:31:03,589 --> 01:31:06,127
You took advantage of our hospitality
last time.

869
01:31:06,217 --> 01:31:09,716
It holds fair now you return the favour.

870
01:31:15,435 --> 01:31:16,514
Barbossa!

871
01:31:18,521 --> 01:31:20,395
Will.

872
01:31:22,317 --> 01:31:24,356
She goes free!

873
01:31:24,444 --> 01:31:26,769
What's in your head, boy?

874
01:31:27,530 --> 01:31:29,404
She goes free.

875
01:31:29,490 --> 01:31:32,694
You've only got one shot,
and we can't die.

876
01:31:33,202 --> 01:31:36,073
Don't do anything stupid.

877
01:31:37,915 --> 01:31:40,323
You can't. I can.

878
01:31:42,086 --> 01:31:44,660
Like that.

879
01:31:44,756 --> 01:31:48,290
- Who are you?
- No one. He's no one.

880
01:31:48,384 --> 01:31:51,551
A distant cousin of my aunt's
nephew, twice removed.

881
01:31:51,638 --> 01:31:53,844
Lovely singing voice, though. Eunuch.

882
01:31:53,931 --> 01:31:58,392
My name is Will Turner!
My father was Bootstrap Bill Turner.

883
01:31:58,478 --> 01:32:01,016
His blood runs in my veins.

884
01:32:01,189 --> 01:32:05,269
It's the spitting image of old
Bootstrap Bill come back to haunt us.

885
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:07,317
On my word, do as I say,

886
01:32:07,403 --> 01:32:11,567
or I'll pull this trigger,
and be lost to Davy Jones' locker!

887
01:32:12,617 --> 01:32:14,906
Name your terms, Mr Turner.

888
01:32:14,994 --> 01:32:17,829
- Elizabeth goes free!
- Yes, we know that one.

889
01:32:17,914 --> 01:32:19,906
Anything else?

890
01:32:21,834 --> 01:32:25,453
And the crew. The crew
are not to be harmed.

891
01:32:29,884 --> 01:32:31,426
Agreed.

892
01:32:50,655 --> 01:32:54,984
Barbossa, you lying bastard.
You swore she'd go free.

893
01:32:55,076 --> 01:32:59,074
Don't dare impugn me honour, boy.
I agreed she'd go free.

894
01:32:59,163 --> 01:33:02,117
It was you who failed to specify
when or where.

895
01:33:08,381 --> 01:33:12,794
Though it does seem a shame to lose
something so fine, don't it, lads?

896
01:33:14,012 --> 01:33:17,012
So I'll be havin' that dress back
before you go.

897
01:33:21,311 --> 01:33:23,469
I always liked you.

898
01:33:26,482 --> 01:33:28,808
Goes with your black heart.

899
01:33:29,902 --> 01:33:31,895
It's still warm.

900
01:33:34,949 --> 01:33:36,989
Off you go.

901
01:33:37,577 --> 01:33:39,569
Come on.

902
01:33:42,582 --> 01:33:44,325
Too long.

903
01:33:54,344 --> 01:33:56,835
I'd really rather hoped
we were past all this.

904
01:33:58,431 --> 01:34:01,467
Jack. Jack!

905
01:34:02,602 --> 01:34:04,144
Did you not notice?

906
01:34:04,228 --> 01:34:08,807
That be the same island that we made
you governor of on our last little trip.

907
01:34:10,276 --> 01:34:11,439
I did notice.

908
01:34:11,653 --> 01:34:15,781
Perhaps you'll be able to conjure up
another miraculous escape.

909
01:34:15,865 --> 01:34:17,858
But I doubt it.

910
01:34:20,328 --> 01:34:22,783
Off you go.

911
01:34:22,872 --> 01:34:25,363
Last time you left me a pistol
with one shot.

912
01:34:25,541 --> 01:34:29,325
By the powers, you're right.
Where be Jack's pistol?

913
01:34:29,420 --> 01:34:31,413
Bring it forward.

914
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:38,925
Seeing as there's two of us, a gentleman
would give us a pair of pistols.

915
01:34:39,013 --> 01:34:43,592
It'll be one pistol as before, and you
can be the gentleman and shoot the lady,

916
01:34:43,685 --> 01:34:46,258
and starve to death yourself.

917
01:35:09,961 --> 01:35:13,544
That's the second time
I've watched that man take my ship.

918
01:35:16,009 --> 01:35:20,172
You were marooned on this island before.
We can escape in the same way.

919
01:35:20,346 --> 01:35:23,181
To what point and purpose, young missy?

920
01:35:23,266 --> 01:35:29,138
The Black Pearl is gone. Unless you have
a lot of sails hidden in that bodice...

921
01:35:29,230 --> 01:35:31,057
Unlikely.

922
01:35:31,149 --> 01:35:34,518
...young Mr. Turner will be dead
long before you can reach him.

923
01:35:36,654 --> 01:35:38,896
But you're Captain Jack Sparrow.

924
01:35:39,115 --> 01:35:43,444
You vanished from under the eyes of
seven agents of the East India Company.

925
01:35:43,536 --> 01:35:46,241
You sacked Nassau port
without even firing a shot.

926
01:35:46,331 --> 01:35:49,248
Are you the pirate
I've read about or not?

927
01:35:51,210 --> 01:35:52,954
How did you escape last time?

928
01:35:59,635 --> 01:36:04,096
Last time I was here
a grand total of three days.

929
01:36:05,391 --> 01:36:06,885
Last time...

930
01:36:08,144 --> 01:36:11,430
the rum runners
used this island as a cache.

931
01:36:11,522 --> 01:36:14,476
They came by and I was able
to barter passage off.

932
01:36:14,567 --> 01:36:18,066
From the looks of things,
they've long been out of business.

933
01:36:18,154 --> 01:36:23,231
You probably have your bloody friend
Norrington to thank for that.

934
01:36:23,326 --> 01:36:25,318
So that's it, then?

935
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:29,821
That's the secret, grand adventure
of the infamous Jack Sparrow.

936
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:35,164
You spent three days
lying on a beach drinking rum.

937
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:41,297
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.

938
01:36:49,477 --> 01:36:52,644
We're devils, we're black sheep
We're really bad eggs

939
01:36:52,730 --> 01:36:54,723
Drink up, me hearties, yo ho

940
01:36:55,483 --> 01:36:56,858
Yo ho, yo ho

941
01:36:56,943 --> 01:36:59,481
A pirate's life for me

942
01:36:59,570 --> 01:37:01,480
I love this song!

943
01:37:04,492 --> 01:37:06,615
Really bad eggs!

944
01:37:11,457 --> 01:37:13,450
When I get the Pearl back,

945
01:37:13,543 --> 01:37:17,706
I'm gonna teach it to the whole crew,
and we'll sing it all the time.

946
01:37:17,797 --> 01:37:21,546
You will be the most fearsome pirates
in the Spanish Main.

947
01:37:21,634 --> 01:37:23,627
Not just the Spanish Main, love.

948
01:37:24,554 --> 01:37:27,923
The entire ocean.
The entire world!

949
01:37:28,933 --> 01:37:32,468
Wherever we want to go, we go.
That's what a ship is.

950
01:37:32,562 --> 01:37:35,349
It's not just a keel and a hull
and a deck and sails.

951
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:38,891
That's what a ship needs.
But what a ship is...

952
01:37:40,403 --> 01:37:44,187
What the Black Pearl really is...

953
01:37:45,033 --> 01:37:47,025
is freedom.

954
01:37:49,078 --> 01:37:50,110
Jack...

955
01:37:50,204 --> 01:37:55,032
It must be really terrible for you
to be trapped on this island.

956
01:37:55,793 --> 01:37:56,956
Oh, yes.

957
01:37:57,045 --> 01:38:01,541
But the company is infinitely better
than last time.

958
01:38:01,632 --> 01:38:06,709
And the scenery has definitely improved.

959
01:38:06,804 --> 01:38:08,263
Mr Sparrow!

960
01:38:08,348 --> 01:38:12,392
I'm not entirely sure I've had enough
rum to allow that kind of talk.

961
01:38:14,062 --> 01:38:16,054
I know exactly what you mean, love.

962
01:38:23,363 --> 01:38:24,905
To freedom!

963
01:38:27,659 --> 01:38:29,651
To the Black Pearl!

964
01:38:58,648 --> 01:38:59,679
No!

965
01:38:59,941 --> 01:39:02,776
Not good! Stop!

966
01:39:02,860 --> 01:39:05,067
Not good! What are you doing?

967
01:39:05,154 --> 01:39:07,906
You've burned all the food,
the shade, the rum.

968
01:39:07,991 --> 01:39:11,324
- Yes, the rum is gone.
- Why is the rum gone?

969
01:39:11,411 --> 01:39:15,989
One, because it is a vile drink that
turns respectable men into scoundrels.

970
01:39:16,332 --> 01:39:19,417
Two, that signal
is over 1,000 feet high.

971
01:39:19,502 --> 01:39:21,744
The entire Royal Navy is looking for me.

972
01:39:21,838 --> 01:39:25,420
Do you think there is the slightest
chance they won't see it?

973
01:39:25,508 --> 01:39:27,086
But why is the rum gone?

974
01:39:28,428 --> 01:39:31,962
Just wait, Captain Sparrow.
You give it one hour, maybe two,

975
01:39:32,056 --> 01:39:36,101
keep a weather eye open, and you
will see white sails on that horizon.

976
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:46,528
"Must've been terrible for you
to be trapped here, Jack."

977
01:39:46,612 --> 01:39:48,605
Well, it bloody is now!

978
01:39:56,039 --> 01:39:58,743
There'll be no living with her
after this.

979
01:39:58,833 --> 01:40:00,790
- But we've got to save Will.
- No.

980
01:40:00,877 --> 01:40:04,459
You're safe now. We will return
to Port Royal immediately,

981
01:40:04,547 --> 01:40:06,540
not go gallivanting after pirates.

982
01:40:06,632 --> 01:40:08,625
Then we condemn him to death.

983
01:40:09,635 --> 01:40:15,057
The boy's fate is regrettable, but
so is his decision to engage in piracy.

984
01:40:15,141 --> 01:40:18,344
To rescue me. To prevent anything
from happening to me.

985
01:40:18,436 --> 01:40:22,730
If I may be so bold as to interject
my professional opinion.

986
01:40:22,815 --> 01:40:28,486
The Pearl was listing to scuppers after
the battle. She won't make good time.

987
01:40:28,571 --> 01:40:32,485
Think about it. The Black Pearl.

988
01:40:32,575 --> 01:40:36,359
The last real pirate threat
in the Caribbean, mate.

989
01:40:37,038 --> 01:40:39,529
How can you pass that up?

990
01:40:40,917 --> 01:40:45,330
By remembering that I serve others,
Mr Sparrow, not only myself.

991
01:40:45,421 --> 01:40:49,039
Commodore, I beg you,
please do this for me.

992
01:40:49,133 --> 01:40:51,256
As a wedding gift.

993
01:40:51,344 --> 01:40:53,502
Elizabeth?

994
01:40:53,596 --> 01:40:56,134
Are you accepting
the Commodore's proposal?

995
01:40:59,018 --> 01:41:00,049
I am.

996
01:41:00,478 --> 01:41:04,013
A wedding. I love weddings.
Drinks all around!

997
01:41:06,317 --> 01:41:09,069
I know. "Clap him in irons," right?

998
01:41:11,614 --> 01:41:15,826
Mr Sparrow, you will accompany
these fine men to the helm

999
01:41:15,910 --> 01:41:19,326
and provide us with a bearing
to Isla de Muerta.

1000
01:41:19,414 --> 01:41:25,416
Then contemplate all possible meanings
of the phrase "silent as the grave".

1001
01:41:25,628 --> 01:41:29,293
- Do I make myself clear?
- Inescapably clear.

1002
01:41:33,177 --> 01:41:36,629
Shiver me timbers.

1003
01:41:36,723 --> 01:41:38,762
Cotton here says you missed a bit.

1004
01:41:43,146 --> 01:41:46,312
You knew William Turner.

1005
01:41:46,399 --> 01:41:49,400
Old Bootstrap Bill, we knew him.

1006
01:41:50,445 --> 01:41:53,865
Never sat well with Bootstrap, what we
did to Jack Sparrow, the mutiny and all.

1007
01:41:53,865 --> 01:41:55,941
Never sat well with Bootstrap, what we
did to Jack Sparrow, the mutiny and all.

1008
01:41:57,160 --> 01:42:00,161
He said it wasn't right with the Code.

1009
01:42:00,246 --> 01:42:03,247
That's why he sent off
a piece of the treasure to you.

1010
01:42:05,001 --> 01:42:07,326
He said we deserved to be cursed,

1011
01:42:08,504 --> 01:42:10,580
and remain cursed.

1012
01:42:10,673 --> 01:42:13,591
- Stupid blighter.
- Good man.

1013
01:42:13,676 --> 01:42:19,382
But, as you can imagine, that didn't
sit too well with the Captain.

1014
01:42:19,474 --> 01:42:22,225
That didn't sit too well
with the Captain at all.

1015
01:42:22,310 --> 01:42:25,928
- Tell him what Barbossa did.
- I'm telling the story!

1016
01:42:28,524 --> 01:42:35,238
So what the captain did, he strapped
a cannon to Bootstrap's bootstraps.

1017
01:42:35,323 --> 01:42:36,817
Bootstrap's bootstraps!

1018
01:42:36,908 --> 01:42:42,412
Last we saw of old Bill Turner, he was
sinking into the crushin' black oblivion

1019
01:42:42,497 --> 01:42:45,663
of Davy Jones' locker!

1020
01:42:46,542 --> 01:42:51,204
It was only after that we learned
we needed his blood to lift the curse.

1021
01:42:51,297 --> 01:42:53,622
That's what you call ironic.

1022
01:42:58,513 --> 01:43:00,505
Bring him.

1023
01:43:06,437 --> 01:43:08,513
I don't care for the situation.

1024
01:43:08,856 --> 01:43:12,142
Any attempt to storm the caves
could turn into an ambush.

1025
01:43:12,235 --> 01:43:15,568
Not if you're the one
doing the ambushing.

1026
01:43:15,655 --> 01:43:19,320
I go in and get Barbossa to send
his men out in their little boats.

1027
01:43:19,409 --> 01:43:25,494
Your mates return to the Dauntless
and blast them with your cannons.

1028
01:43:25,581 --> 01:43:27,870
What do you have to lose?

1029
01:43:27,959 --> 01:43:30,960
Nothing I'd lament being rid of.

1030
01:43:32,088 --> 01:43:36,880
Now, to be honest, there's a risk
to those aboard the Dauntless,

1031
01:43:36,968 --> 01:43:40,882
which includes the future Mrs Commodore.

1032
01:43:40,972 --> 01:43:45,016
- It's for your own safety.
- I don't care, I have to tell him!

1033
01:43:45,101 --> 01:43:48,221
The pirates are cursed!
They can't be killed!

1034
01:43:48,312 --> 01:43:54,565
He's already informed of that. A mermaid
flopped up on deck and told the story.

1035
01:43:54,652 --> 01:43:57,653
This is Jack Sparrow's doing!

1036
01:44:08,291 --> 01:44:12,371
No reason to fret. A prick of the
finger, a few drops of blood...

1037
01:44:12,462 --> 01:44:17,883
No mistakes this time. He's only
half-Turner. We spill it all!

1038
01:44:20,178 --> 01:44:22,847
Guess there is reason to fret.

1039
01:44:36,569 --> 01:44:42,192
- Beg your pardon.
- Begun by blood. By blood...

1040
01:44:45,453 --> 01:44:47,113
Jack!

1041
01:44:47,205 --> 01:44:50,289
- It's not possible.
- Not probable.

1042
01:44:50,917 --> 01:44:53,123
Where's Elizabeth?

1043
01:44:53,503 --> 01:44:58,745
Safe, like I promised. She's set to
marry Norrington, like she promised,

1044
01:44:58,841 --> 01:45:01,249
and you get to die for her
like you promised.

1045
01:45:01,344 --> 01:45:06,765
So we're all men of our word, except
for Elizabeth, who is a woman.

1046
01:45:06,849 --> 01:45:09,340
Shut up! You're next!

1047
01:45:11,854 --> 01:45:16,682
- You don't want to be doing that.
- No, I think I do.

1048
01:45:18,319 --> 01:45:20,359
Your funeral.

1049
01:45:23,574 --> 01:45:27,275
- Why don't I want to be doing it?
- Because...

1050
01:45:28,287 --> 01:45:33,115
The HMS Dauntless,
pride of the Royal Navy,

1051
01:45:33,209 --> 01:45:38,001
is floating just offshore
waiting for you.

1052
01:45:46,431 --> 01:45:48,672
What are we doing here?

1053
01:45:49,517 --> 01:45:52,886
The pirates come out,
unprepared and unawares.

1054
01:45:52,979 --> 01:45:58,566
We catch 'em in a crossfire
and send 'em down to see Old Hob.

1055
01:45:59,235 --> 01:46:05,688
I meant, why aren't we doing
what Mr Sparrow said we should do?

1056
01:46:05,783 --> 01:46:10,694
- With the cannons and all?
- Because it was Mr Sparrow who said it.

1057
01:46:12,874 --> 01:46:15,281
You think he wasn't telling the truth?

1058
01:46:15,585 --> 01:46:18,158
Hear me out, mate.

1059
01:46:18,254 --> 01:46:22,204
Order your men to row out to the
Dauntless, they do what they do best,

1060
01:46:22,300 --> 01:46:26,761
Robert's your uncle, Fanny's your
aunt... There you are with two ships.

1061
01:46:26,846 --> 01:46:29,052
The makings of your own fleet.

1062
01:46:29,140 --> 01:46:32,758
You'll take the grandest as your
flagship and who's to argue?

1063
01:46:32,852 --> 01:46:35,806
But what of the Pearl?

1064
01:46:35,897 --> 01:46:40,689
Name me captain, I'll sail under your
colours and give you 10% of me plunder

1065
01:46:40,777 --> 01:46:47,526
and you get to introduce yourself
as Commodore Barbossa. Savvy?

1066
01:46:47,617 --> 01:46:51,567
And in exchange you want me
not to kill the whelp.

1067
01:46:51,663 --> 01:46:56,823
Not at all. By all means,
kill the whelp. Just not yet.

1068
01:46:56,918 --> 01:47:01,829
Wait to lift the curse
until the opportune moment.

1069
01:47:05,343 --> 01:47:06,920
For instance...

1070
01:47:08,763 --> 01:47:12,049
after you've killed Norrington's men.

1071
01:47:12,141 --> 01:47:13,719
Every...

1072
01:47:13,810 --> 01:47:15,470
last...

1073
01:47:15,561 --> 01:47:16,972
one.

1074
01:47:26,739 --> 01:47:30,654
You've planned this ever since
you learned my name.

1075
01:47:31,452 --> 01:47:33,160
Yeah.

1076
01:47:34,455 --> 01:47:36,697
I want 50% of your plunder.

1077
01:47:36,791 --> 01:47:37,989
- 15.
- 40.

1078
01:47:38,084 --> 01:47:39,543
25.

1079
01:47:40,211 --> 01:47:43,627
I'll buy you the hat.
A really big one.

1080
01:47:44,424 --> 01:47:46,250
Commodore.

1081
01:47:48,678 --> 01:47:50,836
We have an accord.

1082
01:47:51,556 --> 01:47:53,844
All hands to the boats!

1083
01:47:54,726 --> 01:47:57,643
Apologies. You give the orders.

1084
01:47:58,938 --> 01:48:02,437
Gents... take a walk!

1085
01:48:07,613 --> 01:48:09,772
Not to the boats?

1086
01:49:08,091 --> 01:49:10,130
Hold fire.

1087
01:49:13,054 --> 01:49:16,470
This is like what the Greeks
done at Troy.

1088
01:49:17,266 --> 01:49:22,261
Except they was in a horse,
instead of dresses. Wooden horse.

1089
01:49:35,493 --> 01:49:37,569
A moment, please.

1090
01:49:40,665 --> 01:49:42,408
Elizabeth?

1091
01:49:44,919 --> 01:49:50,293
I want you to know I believe you made
a very good decision today.

1092
01:49:50,883 --> 01:49:53,457
Couldn't be more proud of you.

1093
01:49:53,553 --> 01:49:59,140
But a good decision, if made for the
wrong reasons, can be a wrong decision.

1094
01:50:08,109 --> 01:50:09,817
Lieutenant.

1095
01:50:28,338 --> 01:50:30,164
Elizabeth?

1096
01:50:31,632 --> 01:50:34,040
Are you there?

1097
01:50:35,178 --> 01:50:37,751
Are you even listening to me?

1098
01:51:04,999 --> 01:51:07,075
What have you done?

1099
01:51:08,086 --> 01:51:10,707
Stop that! I already feel like a fool.

1100
01:51:11,714 --> 01:51:14,003
You look nice, though.

1101
01:51:17,637 --> 01:51:20,044
I look nice?

1102
01:51:55,883 --> 01:51:59,134
I must admit, Jack, I thought
I had you figured

1103
01:51:59,220 --> 01:52:02,423
but it turns out you're
a hard man to predict.

1104
01:52:02,515 --> 01:52:07,391
I'm dishonest. And a dishonest man
you can trust to be dishonest.

1105
01:52:07,478 --> 01:52:11,974
Honestly, it's the honest ones
you want to watch out for.

1106
01:52:12,066 --> 01:52:18,105
You can never predict when they're going
to do something incredibly... stupid.

1107
01:52:51,314 --> 01:52:55,608
You're off the edge of the map, mate.
Here there be monsters!

1108
01:53:00,406 --> 01:53:02,150
Right.

1109
01:53:03,493 --> 01:53:05,532
What would you eat first?

1110
01:53:05,620 --> 01:53:09,783
We should decide now so we're ready
when the time comes.

1111
01:53:34,941 --> 01:53:36,980
What was that?

1112
01:53:58,923 --> 01:54:00,002
Miss Elizabeth!

1113
01:54:20,653 --> 01:54:22,195
Make for the ship! Move!

1114
01:54:31,622 --> 01:54:33,449
To the ship!

1115
01:54:36,210 --> 01:54:38,084
Row, men!

1116
01:55:15,625 --> 01:55:17,582
You can't beat me, Jack.

1117
01:55:42,026 --> 01:55:44,233
That's interesting.

1118
01:55:54,205 --> 01:55:56,245
I couldn't resist, mate.

1119
01:57:02,523 --> 01:57:03,721
Sorry!

1120
01:57:12,367 --> 01:57:14,489
What now, Jack Sparrow?

1121
01:57:14,577 --> 01:57:20,082
Are we to be two immortals, locked
in an epic battle until Judgment Day?

1122
01:57:20,792 --> 01:57:22,915
Or you could surrender.

1123
01:57:49,320 --> 01:57:52,855
All of you with me. Will is in that cave
and we must save him.

1124
01:57:52,949 --> 01:57:55,522
Ready, and... heave!

1125
01:58:02,208 --> 01:58:04,117
I need your help. Come on!

1126
01:58:04,210 --> 01:58:07,045
Any port in a storm.

1127
01:58:07,130 --> 01:58:09,585
Cotton's right. We've got the Pearl.

1128
01:58:09,674 --> 01:58:13,339
- Are you gonna leave Jack?
- Jack owes us a ship.

1129
01:58:13,594 --> 01:58:16,798
- There's the Code to consider.
- The Code?

1130
01:58:18,307 --> 01:58:22,554
You're pirates. Hang the Code
and hang the rules!

1131
01:58:22,645 --> 01:58:24,970
They're more like guidelines.

1132
01:58:28,818 --> 01:58:30,941
Bloody pirates!

1133
01:58:42,415 --> 01:58:44,573
Is it supposed to be doing that?

1134
01:58:44,667 --> 01:58:47,123
They're stealing our ship.

1135
01:58:47,211 --> 01:58:49,038
Bloody pirates!

1136
01:58:51,049 --> 01:58:52,922
Boarders away.

1137
01:59:01,225 --> 01:59:03,052
Come on!

1138
01:59:29,128 --> 01:59:31,121
Me eye!

1139
01:59:50,441 --> 01:59:52,517
I'll teach you the meaning of pain.

1140
01:59:52,610 --> 01:59:54,852
You like pain?

1141
01:59:55,947 --> 01:59:58,105
Try wearing a corset.

1142
02:00:07,875 --> 02:00:10,117
Whose side is Jack on?

1143
02:00:10,211 --> 02:00:12,536
At the moment?

1144
02:00:47,582 --> 02:00:49,455
No fair!

1145
02:01:12,774 --> 02:01:17,067
Ten years you carry that pistol
and now you waste your shot.

1146
02:01:17,820 --> 02:01:20,738
He didn't waste it.

1147
02:01:45,431 --> 02:01:47,554
I feel...

1148
02:01:51,521 --> 02:01:53,928
cold.

1149
02:02:55,168 --> 02:02:57,326
Parley?

1150
02:02:57,795 --> 02:03:01,923
- The ship is ours, gentlemen.
- Huzzah!

1151
02:03:08,014 --> 02:03:10,683
Huzzah! Huzzah!

1152
02:03:48,012 --> 02:03:50,052
We should return to the Dauntless.

1153
02:03:52,517 --> 02:03:56,217
Your fiancé will want to know
you're safe.

1154
02:04:06,030 --> 02:04:09,814
If you were waiting
for the opportune moment...

1155
02:04:09,909 --> 02:04:12,151
that was it.

1156
02:04:13,121 --> 02:04:17,783
Now, I'd be much obliged
if you'd drop me off at my ship.

1157
02:04:22,630 --> 02:04:24,789
I'm sorry, Jack.

1158
02:04:26,884 --> 02:04:32,045
They done what's right by them.
Can't expect more than that.

1159
02:04:46,571 --> 02:04:48,777
Jack Sparrow...

1160
02:04:49,574 --> 02:04:52,029
Captain Jack Sparrow.

1161
02:04:52,702 --> 02:04:55,905
...for your crimes against the Crown.

1162
02:04:57,248 --> 02:05:01,709
Said crimes being numerous in quantity
and sinister in nature.

1163
02:05:02,420 --> 02:05:06,038
The most egregious of these
to be cited herewith:

1164
02:05:06,132 --> 02:05:08,753
Piracy, smuggling...

1165
02:05:08,843 --> 02:05:11,049
This is wrong.

1166
02:05:11,137 --> 02:05:16,178
Commodore Norrington is bound
by the law, as are we all.

1167
02:05:16,434 --> 02:05:19,803
...impersonating an officer
of the Spanish Royal Navy,

1168
02:05:19,896 --> 02:05:23,561
impersonating a cleric
of the Church of England,

1169
02:05:23,649 --> 02:05:28,892
sailing under false colours,
arson, kidnapping, looting,

1170
02:05:28,988 --> 02:05:32,938
poaching, brigandage, pilfering,

1171
02:05:33,034 --> 02:05:37,495
depravity, depredation
and general lawlessness.

1172
02:05:39,123 --> 02:05:46,040
For these crimes, you are sentenced
to be hung by the neck until dead.

1173
02:05:47,382 --> 02:05:49,754
May God have mercy on your soul.

1174
02:05:49,842 --> 02:05:52,001
Governor Swann.

1175
02:05:52,095 --> 02:05:54,052
Commodore.

1176
02:05:54,639 --> 02:05:56,845
Elizabeth.

1177
02:05:56,933 --> 02:06:01,642
I should have told you every day
from the moment I met you...

1178
02:06:03,147 --> 02:06:05,270
I love you.

1179
02:06:18,788 --> 02:06:20,366
Watch yourself!

1180
02:06:20,790 --> 02:06:22,249
Marines!

1181
02:06:22,333 --> 02:06:24,326
I can't breathe.

1182
02:06:24,752 --> 02:06:25,997
Elizabeth!

1183
02:06:29,173 --> 02:06:30,833
Move!

1184
02:07:44,165 --> 02:07:48,661
I thought we might have to endure
some ill-conceived escape attempt,

1185
02:07:48,753 --> 02:07:50,746
but not from you.

1186
02:07:50,838 --> 02:07:54,042
On our return to Port Royal,
I granted you clemency.

1187
02:07:54,133 --> 02:07:58,926
And this is how you thank me?
By throwing in your lot with him?

1188
02:07:59,013 --> 02:08:01,635
- He's a pirate.
- And a good man.

1189
02:08:03,434 --> 02:08:08,595
If this means the hangman will earn two
pairs of boots instead of one, so be it.

1190
02:08:08,690 --> 02:08:10,433
My conscience will be clear.

1191
02:08:10,525 --> 02:08:13,526
You forget your place, Turner.

1192
02:08:15,321 --> 02:08:19,568
It's right here, between you and Jack.

1193
02:08:23,037 --> 02:08:25,362
- As is mine.
- Elizabeth.

1194
02:08:26,916 --> 02:08:30,783
Lower your weapons.
Put them down!

1195
02:08:35,883 --> 02:08:38,837
So this is where your heart truly lies?

1196
02:08:40,179 --> 02:08:42,006
It is.

1197
02:08:50,732 --> 02:08:54,314
I'm feeling good about this.

1198
02:08:54,402 --> 02:08:56,809
We've all arrived at a special place.

1199
02:08:56,904 --> 02:09:02,195
Spiritually, ecumenically,
grammatically.

1200
02:09:03,036 --> 02:09:06,950
I want you to know
that I was rooting for you, mate.

1201
02:09:07,040 --> 02:09:08,949
Know that.

1202
02:09:12,086 --> 02:09:14,328
Elizabeth.

1203
02:09:15,715 --> 02:09:19,166
It would never have worked
between us, darling.

1204
02:09:19,427 --> 02:09:21,135
I'm sorry.

1205
02:09:23,681 --> 02:09:25,721
Will.

1206
02:09:26,851 --> 02:09:29,259
Nice hat.

1207
02:09:29,979 --> 02:09:31,723
Friends.

1208
02:09:34,067 --> 02:09:39,025
This is the day that you will always
remember as the day that...

1209
02:09:44,285 --> 02:09:46,741
Idiot. He's nowhere to go
but back to the noose.

1210
02:09:49,165 --> 02:09:50,992
Sail ho!

1211
02:09:58,591 --> 02:10:00,963
What's your plan of action?

1212
02:10:01,886 --> 02:10:03,713
Sir!

1213
02:10:07,517 --> 02:10:11,217
Perhaps on the rare occasion,
pursuing the right course

1214
02:10:11,312 --> 02:10:13,554
demands an act of piracy.

1215
02:10:13,981 --> 02:10:17,564
Piracy itself can be the right course.

1216
02:10:22,073 --> 02:10:24,112
Mr Turner.

1217
02:10:29,122 --> 02:10:32,076
I will accept the consequences
of my actions.

1218
02:10:37,880 --> 02:10:40,336
This is a beautiful sword.

1219
02:10:42,343 --> 02:10:44,252
I expect the man who made it

1220
02:10:44,345 --> 02:10:48,758
to show the same care and devotion
in every aspect of his life.

1221
02:10:50,768 --> 02:10:52,512
Thank you.

1222
02:10:55,356 --> 02:10:58,274
Commodore! What about Sparrow?

1223
02:11:00,153 --> 02:11:04,447
I think we can afford to give him
one day's head start.

1224
02:11:09,537 --> 02:11:11,826
So...

1225
02:11:12,415 --> 02:11:15,369
This is the path you've chosen, is it?

1226
02:11:16,919 --> 02:11:20,620
After all, he is a blacksmith.

1227
02:11:21,716 --> 02:11:23,755
No.

1228
02:11:27,972 --> 02:11:29,846
He's a pirate.

1229
02:12:06,511 --> 02:12:09,547
Thought you were supposed
to keep to the Code?

1230
02:12:09,639 --> 02:12:13,506
We figured they were more
actual... guidelines.

1231
02:12:17,897 --> 02:12:19,439
Thank you.

1232
02:12:20,525 --> 02:12:22,731
Captain Sparrow.

1233
02:12:26,155 --> 02:12:28,444
The Black Pearl is yours.

1234
02:12:43,631 --> 02:12:49,420
On deck, you scabrous dogs! Hands
to braces! Let go and haul to run free!

1235
02:12:51,013 --> 02:12:54,632
Now... bring me that horizon.

1236
02:13:01,983 --> 02:13:04,652
And really bad eggs

1237
02:13:07,280 --> 02:13:09,687
Drink up, me hearties. Yo ho!
