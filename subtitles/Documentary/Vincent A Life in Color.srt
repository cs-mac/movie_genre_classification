1
00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:33,984
So this Irish guy

2
00:00:34,151 --> 00:00:35,653
knocks on this lady's door and says,

3
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,572
you know,
"Have you got any, uh... Any, uh...

4
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:39,740
work for me?"

5
00:00:40,282 --> 00:00:42,409
And she says, "Um, well, you know,

6
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:44,912
as a matter of fact,
you could paint the porch."

7
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:50,835
But two hours later,
the guy comes back and says,

8
00:00:51,544 --> 00:00:52,962
"I'm already finished, ma'am,

9
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:57,216
but just for your information,
it's not a Porsche, it's a BMW."

10
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:48,017
OK, asshole.

11
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:50,144
Giddyap.

12
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:57,943
The female lemur is a better jumper

13
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,280
and more efficient forager
than her male counterpart.

14
00:02:01,447 --> 00:02:04,325
She has dominance over the male...

15
00:02:05,284 --> 00:02:08,245
Oh, my God... feel this.

16
00:02:08,412 --> 00:02:09,788
Baby's kicking. Feel.

17
00:02:09,955 --> 00:02:12,249
Touch it. No, not my boob.

18
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:14,418
Here.

19
00:02:14,585 --> 00:02:16,629
Sorry we woke you up.

20
00:02:19,882 --> 00:02:22,009
It was him, this asshole.

21
00:02:32,478 --> 00:02:35,105
- What's this?
- I'm a little tight right now.

22
00:02:35,898 --> 00:02:38,525
My shit is not layaway.
I'm not JCPenney.

23
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:40,235
You know I'm good for it.

24
00:02:40,402 --> 00:02:43,864
I don't make like before, Vin.
Only a few freaks like the belly.

25
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,242
I have to save for maternity leave.

26
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,703
Hey, I like the belly, OK?

27
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:52,414
I'll see you next Tuesday.

28
00:02:52,581 --> 00:02:55,000
Extra when you do, OK? Double.

29
00:02:57,169 --> 00:02:59,171
This one here says
the line is frozen.

30
00:02:59,338 --> 00:03:03,384
Yes, with these reverse mortgages,
you can only borrow a percentage

31
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,470
of the equity you have in the house.
That's called the loan-to-value.

32
00:03:06,637 --> 00:03:09,515
But now, since you've been
getting monthly payments from us

33
00:03:09,682 --> 00:03:12,393
for the last, uh... eight years,

34
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:14,103
you've reached the cash-out limit.

35
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:16,814
That's that loan-to-value thing
I just mentioned.

36
00:03:16,981 --> 00:03:19,441
- The house is worth...
- It was worth.

37
00:03:19,608 --> 00:03:21,860
Whatever it was worth.

38
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:23,904
I need that money.

39
00:03:24,613 --> 00:03:27,282
I'm sorry, Mr. MacKenna,
but there's really nothing I can do.

40
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:28,784
Uh...

41
00:03:28,951 --> 00:03:32,204
- It is what it is.
- "It is what it is"?

42
00:03:32,371 --> 00:03:35,082
Everyone's saying that now.
You know what it means?

43
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:39,420
"You're screwed,
and you shall remain screwed."

44
00:03:59,732 --> 00:04:01,275
I want to close this account.

45
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:03,777
I'm so sorry to hear that, sir.
May I ask why?

46
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:05,946
Lady, you're just a spoke on a wheel,

47
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:08,741
trying to make a living
like the rest of us schmucks.

48
00:04:08,907 --> 00:04:12,036
I do not want to tell you
to go fuck yourself, so let's...

49
00:04:12,202 --> 00:04:14,538
I'm closing it, OK?
Let's just leave it at that, please.

50
00:04:14,705 --> 00:04:16,331
OK.

51
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,588
$112.14.

52
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:26,341
- All right, small bills.
- No, sir.

53
00:04:26,508 --> 00:04:27,718
You're overdrawn that much.

54
00:04:27,885 --> 00:04:29,219
What does that mean?

55
00:04:29,386 --> 00:04:32,639
You took out more money
than you actually have in your account.

56
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:35,059
Here's zero. You went below zero.

57
00:04:35,225 --> 00:04:38,437
So I... can't close this account?

58
00:04:38,604 --> 00:04:39,897
You can.

59
00:04:40,064 --> 00:04:41,774
Once you get it back to zero.

60
00:04:45,569 --> 00:04:47,237
Hey, you taking care of yourself, Vin?

61
00:04:48,322 --> 00:04:49,656
Yeah, blurry eyes.

62
00:04:50,532 --> 00:04:52,743
I'm doing aerobics, can't you tell?

63
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:55,996
I'm doing the Jane Fonda workout.

64
00:04:56,163 --> 00:05:00,167
A one, two, three, and stretch.

65
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:03,045
Jamie's still looking good.

66
00:05:03,212 --> 00:05:06,340
Roger, is there any chance
you could ever make one of these

67
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:10,177
that's strong enough for someone that's
not, um... your sister?

68
00:05:10,344 --> 00:05:12,096
Why don't we give it a break
for a minute.

69
00:05:12,262 --> 00:05:14,389
- Give what a break?
- The liquor.

70
00:05:14,556 --> 00:05:16,642
You're not gonna serve me?

71
00:05:16,809 --> 00:05:18,352
Don't be like that.

72
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,062
I'm watching out for you here.

73
00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:22,064
You watching out for me?

74
00:05:22,231 --> 00:05:26,318
You serve poison all day to all these
people that don't know no better.

75
00:05:26,485 --> 00:05:28,737
So they can die
while they're living.

76
00:05:28,904 --> 00:05:32,366
And you're watching out for me.
You phony.

77
00:06:58,118 --> 00:07:02,456
Oh, Blanche, these are my friends,
Rose and Dorothy.

78
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:09,213
Come here.

79
00:08:14,152 --> 00:08:16,029
Shut up!

80
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:17,406
People are sleeping!

81
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,454
Ah, piss.

82
00:08:34,923 --> 00:08:37,092
Hey! What's going on?

83
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:39,261
You habla English?

84
00:08:39,428 --> 00:08:40,971
Yes, we speak English, señor.

85
00:08:41,138 --> 00:08:43,265
Then what the hell
are you doing here?

86
00:08:44,433 --> 00:08:47,311
That's my tree you assholes hit.

87
00:08:48,353 --> 00:08:49,938
And my fence.

88
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:51,773
And my damn car.

89
00:08:52,274 --> 00:08:54,401
Do you speak English?

90
00:08:54,568 --> 00:08:57,070
- Stay here.
- Yes, sir.

91
00:08:58,405 --> 00:09:00,240
I'm calling the cops.

92
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:02,784
- Is everybody OK?
- What do you want?

93
00:09:02,951 --> 00:09:05,704
- I'm Maggie. I'm your new neighbor.
- So?

94
00:09:06,788 --> 00:09:08,248
Well, we're moving in.

95
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:11,543
I can see that, yeah.
Are these dipshits with you?

96
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:15,547
Yes, they're the men I hired
from the moving company.

97
00:09:17,007 --> 00:09:18,300
Oh, boy.

98
00:09:18,467 --> 00:09:20,510
"Oh, boy"? No.
"Oh, shit" is more like it.

99
00:09:20,677 --> 00:09:22,095
This fence is 20 years old.

100
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:24,014
The car's 30.

101
00:09:24,181 --> 00:09:27,434
The tree is older than I am.

102
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:32,314
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm not sure what I'm...

103
00:09:32,481 --> 00:09:34,608
This is not how I wanted
to meet, either.

104
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:36,985
- Did you do this?
- Of course they did it.

105
00:09:37,152 --> 00:09:39,321
What are you, stupid?
Look at the crime scene.

106
00:09:39,488 --> 00:09:42,282
OK, you don't have to be rude to me!
I'm just trying to move in here.

107
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:45,327
I hired these guys to do it.
And accidents happen.

108
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,541
Well, the car is an antique, Missy.
I mean, it's worth a lot.

109
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:54,252
- Then I'll take care of it.
- You?

110
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:55,796
You don't got no money.

111
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:59,341
What? I mean, no offense, but you just
don't look like you do. OK?

112
00:09:59,508 --> 00:10:01,635
And I'm sure Chico and the Man here
are off the books.

113
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:04,846
No, I will sue the moving company.

114
00:10:05,847 --> 00:10:08,308
You can buck up for the fence
and the tree.

115
00:10:11,061 --> 00:10:12,187
Fine.

116
00:10:14,606 --> 00:10:15,690
Toodles.

117
00:10:15,857 --> 00:10:17,234
Is that our new neighbor?

118
00:10:17,401 --> 00:10:18,735
Yep.

119
00:10:18,902 --> 00:10:20,737
It's gonna be a long life.

120
00:10:22,906 --> 00:10:24,199
"'Well,' said the tree,

121
00:10:24,366 --> 00:10:26,576
straightening herself up
as much as she could,

122
00:10:26,743 --> 00:10:29,204
'An old stump is good
for sitting and resting.

123
00:10:29,371 --> 00:10:31,915
Come, boy, sit down.
Sit down and rest.'

124
00:10:32,082 --> 00:10:36,169
And the boy did.
And the tree was happy."

125
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:37,671
God, that's depressing.

126
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:39,256
No, it's not.

127
00:10:39,423 --> 00:10:40,590
The tree was meant to give,

128
00:10:40,757 --> 00:10:43,552
so to be able to give everything
and have nothing left

129
00:10:43,718 --> 00:10:45,429
is the best life
the tree could ever have.

130
00:10:46,805 --> 00:10:48,515
Well, your father
must think I'm a tree.

131
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:51,184
- Why would he think that?
- Nothing. Nothing.

132
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:53,812
It's good you think good things.
Come on.

133
00:10:53,979 --> 00:10:55,230
Get in there.

134
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:57,816
All right, big day tomorrow.

135
00:10:57,983 --> 00:10:59,609
Yeah, I know, first day.

136
00:10:59,776 --> 00:11:01,194
Yeah, for me, too.

137
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:03,989
And I can't be late, all right?
It's just me and you now.

138
00:11:04,156 --> 00:11:06,283
- I know.
- Set your alarm

139
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:09,661
and make sure I don't oversleep.
Good night.

140
00:11:11,413 --> 00:11:13,582
All right. Here, I made you
peanut butter and banana.

141
00:11:13,748 --> 00:11:14,791
- Thanks, Mom.
- OK.

142
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:16,543
Do you have your snack money
in your pocket?

143
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,462
- And your keys?
- Yep.

144
00:11:18,628 --> 00:11:20,589
- You got your phone? Map?
- Uh-huh.

145
00:11:20,755 --> 00:11:23,133
- Yep, on the phone.
- OK, what time do you get out?

146
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,886
- 2:45.
- All right, come straight home,

147
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:28,096
start your homework, and I'll be home
a couple hours after that.

148
00:11:29,347 --> 00:11:31,558
Wait, Ma, you're not gonna
pick me up or anything?

149
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:35,312
I'm in the bus lane! I'm not gonna get
another ticket, Oliver! Bye, be good!

150
00:12:12,516 --> 00:12:13,808
OK, settle down!

151
00:12:13,975 --> 00:12:16,520
Settle down! Settle down!
Settle down! Settle down!

152
00:12:16,686 --> 00:12:20,190
I know it's hard to contain yourselves
when you're so, so young

153
00:12:20,357 --> 00:12:22,692
and full of sugar juice,

154
00:12:22,859 --> 00:12:25,779
but we must concentrate on our studies
or we will what?

155
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:27,072
We will die dumb.

156
00:12:27,239 --> 00:12:30,200
Yes, we will, and dumbness
does not play well in Heaven.

157
00:12:30,367 --> 00:12:31,701
This is Oliver.

158
00:12:31,868 --> 00:12:34,329
Oliver is joining us midstream
here at St. Patrick,

159
00:12:34,496 --> 00:12:37,123
and we are very happy to have him,
are we not?

160
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:40,293
Welcome to St. Patrick, Oliver.

161
00:12:41,836 --> 00:12:43,880
Such genuine caring. Thank you.

162
00:12:44,047 --> 00:12:47,092
I think you feel touched? Right?
You feel touched by that?

163
00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:51,096
Maybe as a thank you,
you can lead us all in morning prayer.

164
00:12:58,853 --> 00:13:01,898
I think... I think I'm Jewish.

165
00:13:02,065 --> 00:13:03,316
OK.

166
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:05,110
Good to know.

167
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:07,862
Oliver thinks he's Jewish.

168
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:09,698
- So am I.
- I'm Buddhist.

169
00:13:09,864 --> 00:13:10,907
There is no God.

170
00:13:12,742 --> 00:13:14,160
Yes. You get the idea.

171
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:17,289
We celebrate all the religions
of the world in this room, Oliver.

172
00:13:17,455 --> 00:13:21,418
I'm a Catholic, which is the best
of all the religions, really,

173
00:13:21,585 --> 00:13:23,336
because we have the most rules

174
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:24,921
and the best clothes,

175
00:13:25,088 --> 00:13:28,049
but among us there is also
a Buddhist, agnostic.

176
00:13:28,216 --> 00:13:31,845
We have a Baptist,
and we have an "I don't know,"

177
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:34,556
which seems to be the fastest
growing religion in the world.

178
00:13:34,723 --> 00:13:36,683
And now we have
"I think I'm Jewish,"

179
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:40,186
which is a new one for the class,
Oliver, so thanks for that,

180
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:44,232
but it does not preclude you
from giving us a morning prayer.

181
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,943
Let us bow our heads and pray.

182
00:13:48,153 --> 00:13:49,613
Dear...

183
00:13:51,072 --> 00:13:52,282
God, et cetera.

184
00:13:54,743 --> 00:13:59,080
Dear... Dear God... thank you?

185
00:14:02,334 --> 00:14:03,460
- Amen.
- Amen.

186
00:14:03,627 --> 00:14:05,962
- Amen! Amen, thanks be to God.
- Amen.

187
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:08,173
All right, stirring stuff.

188
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,592
Well done, Oliver.
Go grab yourself a seat.

189
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:13,595
And everybody else
dust off those textbooks

190
00:14:13,762 --> 00:14:15,305
and go to chapter 12.

191
00:14:15,472 --> 00:14:18,850
That's chapter 12, Catholic saints.

192
00:14:32,781 --> 00:14:34,449
All right, I'm here.

193
00:14:37,202 --> 00:14:39,287
I'm here. I'm ready. I'm able.

194
00:14:39,621 --> 00:14:41,956
Let's get this. Come on.

195
00:14:48,463 --> 00:14:51,508
Look at that, it's Ground
Pepper sprinting ahead on the inside!

196
00:14:51,675 --> 00:14:53,426
Come on, dig in.

197
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:54,969
Come on.

198
00:14:57,555 --> 00:14:58,556
Come on!

199
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:01,976
One time!

200
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,230
One damn time!

201
00:15:06,523 --> 00:15:08,483
You son of a bitch!

202
00:15:11,486 --> 00:15:15,281
I don't know why you get
so pissy, Vinny.

203
00:15:16,408 --> 00:15:18,952
You always lose. It seems like
you'd be comfortable by now.

204
00:15:22,205 --> 00:15:23,665
Yeah, tough day.

205
00:15:29,003 --> 00:15:30,422
Help yourself.

206
00:15:32,257 --> 00:15:35,176
I'm thirsty.
And you owe me money, Vin.

207
00:15:35,343 --> 00:15:37,387
I got a situation I'm working out.

208
00:15:37,554 --> 00:15:40,140
You know, I'm not
the sole proprietor here.

209
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:41,891
I've got other people to answer to.

210
00:15:42,058 --> 00:15:43,852
I just need a little time, that's all.

211
00:15:44,018 --> 00:15:45,353
So what do I tell them?

212
00:15:46,563 --> 00:15:47,564
A month.

213
00:15:50,108 --> 00:15:51,776
We'll split the difference.

214
00:15:53,194 --> 00:15:54,195
Make it two weeks.

215
00:16:17,594 --> 00:16:19,220
Watch out!

216
00:16:30,648 --> 00:16:32,567
All right, how many?

217
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:35,570
And time!

218
00:16:36,988 --> 00:16:39,157
You can let go now.

219
00:16:39,324 --> 00:16:42,744
Did they have physical education
in the last school you went to?

220
00:16:42,911 --> 00:16:44,245
- Yes.
- Did you take it?

221
00:16:44,412 --> 00:16:45,914
Yes, sir.

222
00:16:51,836 --> 00:16:53,338
Look who it is.
There's the strong man.

223
00:16:53,505 --> 00:16:54,839
"I think I'm Jewish."

224
00:16:55,006 --> 00:16:56,341
My name's Oliver, by the way.

225
00:16:57,717 --> 00:16:59,093
"My name's Oliver."

226
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,762
You little turd.

227
00:17:00,929 --> 00:17:02,931
- Where'd you come from, anyway, huh?
- Hello.

228
00:17:03,097 --> 00:17:04,724
Did you guys hear the bell?

229
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:06,768
That means to move, go to class.

230
00:17:06,935 --> 00:17:08,603
Come on, let's go.

231
00:17:11,147 --> 00:17:13,358
Can't even do a sit-up.

232
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,819
- Do you need a map?
- No, sir.

233
00:17:15,985 --> 00:17:18,822
Well, you better double-time it,
or you're gonna be late. Let's go.

234
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:24,744
Shit.

235
00:17:33,211 --> 00:17:35,463
Who took his clothes?

236
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:43,179
Nice shorts.

237
00:19:18,441 --> 00:19:19,984
Sir?

238
00:19:22,403 --> 00:19:24,030
Take me, God. Don't play with me.

239
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:25,531
It's me, sir.

240
00:19:29,118 --> 00:19:30,119
Yeah, what?

241
00:19:30,286 --> 00:19:32,163
I was wondering
if I could use your phone?

242
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,332
- My phone?
- Yes.

243
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,335
- In my house?
- Yes, sir.

244
00:19:37,502 --> 00:19:39,712
I need to call my mom.
I'm locked out of the house,

245
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:42,757
'cause these guys in gym class
took my keys and my phone

246
00:19:42,924 --> 00:19:44,801
and I can't get in.
And they also took my wallet.

247
00:19:44,968 --> 00:19:47,512
I don't need to hear
the whole story, OK?

248
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,263
One call.

249
00:19:50,014 --> 00:19:52,350
Hi. It's Maggie.
Can't take your call right now.

250
00:19:52,517 --> 00:19:53,434
Please leave a message.

251
00:19:54,686 --> 00:19:57,897
Oh, hey, Mom. I, uh, lost my keys
for the house and my wallet

252
00:19:58,064 --> 00:20:00,066
and my phone, and I'm at the...

253
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:02,485
old guy's next-door.

254
00:20:02,652 --> 00:20:04,529
Uh, sir, what's your name?

255
00:20:04,696 --> 00:20:08,241
- Vincent, the old guy.
- Vincent, the old guy.

256
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,495
The mean one.

257
00:20:34,392 --> 00:20:36,394
What's your name?

258
00:20:36,561 --> 00:20:38,438
It's Oliver, sir.

259
00:20:40,398 --> 00:20:42,400
They let you wear
those shorts to school?

260
00:20:42,567 --> 00:20:45,820
Well, it's a long story, sir.

261
00:20:45,987 --> 00:20:47,989
I'm sure it is.

262
00:21:00,376 --> 00:21:01,794
Yeah?

263
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:05,590
Hi. Uh, this is Maggie, Oliver's mom.

264
00:21:05,757 --> 00:21:07,383
Your kid's here.

265
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:09,677
Yeah, I know. I got his message.
I hope that's all right.

266
00:21:09,844 --> 00:21:11,179
Is what all right?

267
00:21:11,345 --> 00:21:14,182
- That he stays there.
- Stays here?

268
00:21:14,348 --> 00:21:16,726
- Like what, stays here?
- I'm at work.

269
00:21:16,893 --> 00:21:19,437
I've got three or four more cases, and
I'm not gonna be home for a few hours,

270
00:21:19,604 --> 00:21:21,481
so I'm kind of in a jam here.

271
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:23,232
You want me to babysit?

272
00:21:23,399 --> 00:21:26,861
Well, it's not...
it's not like he's a baby.

273
00:21:27,028 --> 00:21:29,697
I mean, he's just probably gonna
sit quietly and do his homework.

274
00:21:29,864 --> 00:21:31,491
He's... he's really easy.

275
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:32,909
Sir, is that...

276
00:21:34,202 --> 00:21:36,204
- How much you paying?
- What?

277
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,538
You want me to babysit.

278
00:21:37,705 --> 00:21:39,832
I'm not a philanthropy.

279
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:42,794
- I don't... Ten dollars an hour?
- Twelve.

280
00:21:44,587 --> 00:21:47,882
OK, $12 an hour. Can I talk to him?

281
00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:49,759
It's for you.

282
00:21:52,345 --> 00:21:54,514
...I said, sit up!

283
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,140
Up!

284
00:21:58,601 --> 00:22:00,520
He doesn't like many people.

285
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:02,772
I'm good with animals, sir.

286
00:22:02,939 --> 00:22:06,067
Yeah. He doesn't usually like people
who say they're good with animals.

287
00:22:10,321 --> 00:22:11,280
OK, pal...

288
00:22:12,573 --> 00:22:14,242
You never seen Abbott and Costello?

289
00:22:14,408 --> 00:22:16,160
No, sir. Are they old?

290
00:22:16,327 --> 00:22:17,495
No.

291
00:22:17,662 --> 00:22:19,330
They're dead.

292
00:22:19,497 --> 00:22:21,833
That's the oldest you can be.

293
00:22:21,999 --> 00:22:24,127
Or the youngest.
Time freezes when you're dead.

294
00:22:25,837 --> 00:22:27,130
Where'd you learn that?

295
00:22:27,296 --> 00:22:28,381
A book.

296
00:22:28,548 --> 00:22:29,966
What book?

297
00:22:30,133 --> 00:22:33,219
A kids book, sir.
I doubt you'd know it.

298
00:22:35,388 --> 00:22:36,472
It's dinnertime.

299
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:41,519
- You hungry or something?
- A little, sir.

300
00:22:41,686 --> 00:22:42,603
That figures.

301
00:22:45,273 --> 00:22:48,276
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

302
00:23:11,966 --> 00:23:14,302
You're getting sushi.

303
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,223
You see, your troubles are all over.

304
00:23:26,564 --> 00:23:27,815
That's probably your mother.

305
00:23:27,982 --> 00:23:29,859
Probably, sir.

306
00:23:30,026 --> 00:23:31,861
- Don't get up.
- OK.

307
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:34,405
Hi. I...

308
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:38,910
- Hi. Vincent?
- Yep.

309
00:23:39,076 --> 00:23:41,120
Maggie. I...

310
00:23:41,287 --> 00:23:43,122
Thank you for watching him.

311
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:46,459
You know, with the new job and...
my boss, you know...

312
00:23:46,626 --> 00:23:49,003
- I don't need to hear the whole story.
- OK.

313
00:23:50,338 --> 00:23:51,756
Um, oh...

314
00:23:51,923 --> 00:23:53,090
Here.

315
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:55,968
What'd we say? Was that...

316
00:23:56,135 --> 00:23:58,471
that three hours at... at $12...

317
00:23:58,638 --> 00:24:01,015
- $36.
- Yeah. Yeah, I know that.

318
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:04,268
- Um, I've got two twenties.
- I don't have change.

319
00:24:05,728 --> 00:24:06,771
That's fine.

320
00:24:06,938 --> 00:24:09,273
How come you don't have anyone
to watch this kid after school?

321
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,441
We just moved in.

322
00:24:10,608 --> 00:24:11,817
Where's the father?

323
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:14,237
We met in college,
and it turns out that...

324
00:24:14,403 --> 00:24:17,531
- he had been seeing someone...
- Don't need to tell it, then.

325
00:24:17,698 --> 00:24:19,325
You gonna pay for my fence?

326
00:24:19,492 --> 00:24:20,910
Yeah, I... yes,

327
00:24:21,077 --> 00:24:23,120
- I said I was going to.
- And my tree?

328
00:24:23,287 --> 00:24:26,374
I'm not sure how...
I can pay for a branch.

329
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:29,794
Everything has a price.
You're an adult, you should know that.

330
00:24:30,878 --> 00:24:32,713
All right. Let me know.

331
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,424
I can watch the kid after school,
a few hours.

332
00:24:35,591 --> 00:24:37,885
Same price.

333
00:24:38,052 --> 00:24:40,346
I can do $11 an hour,
you pay the snacks.

334
00:24:41,555 --> 00:24:44,100
Your kid ate my last can of sardines.

335
00:24:44,725 --> 00:24:45,726
Really?

336
00:24:47,478 --> 00:24:49,397
- Smell his breath.
- They have those options...

337
00:24:51,524 --> 00:24:53,442
I thought you ate at Vincent's house.

338
00:24:53,609 --> 00:24:54,735
We had sushi.

339
00:24:54,902 --> 00:24:56,070
You had sushi?

340
00:24:56,237 --> 00:24:59,240
Well, sardines. He calls it sushi.
Didn't want to hurt his feelings.

341
00:24:59,407 --> 00:25:00,700
So, you like him?

342
00:25:02,285 --> 00:25:03,786
Well, he's interesting.

343
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,747
Sort of cool,
in a grouchy sort of way.

344
00:25:06,914 --> 00:25:08,791
Yeah, I'll bet he is.

345
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:13,462
He has a cool cat, though, Felix.

346
00:25:13,629 --> 00:25:15,298
You know, he, uh...

347
00:25:15,464 --> 00:25:17,591
offered to watch you after school.

348
00:25:17,758 --> 00:25:20,136
- He did?
- That's a horrible idea, right?

349
00:25:21,262 --> 00:25:22,888
Well...

350
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:25,683
he lives right next door.
You can't get closer than that.

351
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:28,352
Yeah, I had thought about that.

352
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:32,565
You know, it would save me
from having to find a babysitter.

353
00:25:34,275 --> 00:25:35,985
You'll be home, though, right?

354
00:25:36,152 --> 00:25:39,155
Yeah, I'm gonna come home,
but sometimes late.

355
00:25:39,322 --> 00:25:42,491
You know, I'm the one that has to work
now. Your father's not helping.

356
00:25:42,658 --> 00:25:45,953
I don't know if he ever is going to.
And your school's not exactly cheap.

357
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,706
I guess he's too old
to be dangerous,

358
00:25:48,873 --> 00:25:51,042
and not too old to be
too dangerous, either.

359
00:25:51,208 --> 00:25:52,877
If you know what I mean.

360
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:20,905
Stupid place.

361
00:26:21,072 --> 00:26:22,907
Who pissed in your Cheerios?

362
00:26:24,367 --> 00:26:25,493
I can't dance no more.

363
00:26:25,659 --> 00:26:26,952
Oh, that's a surprise.

364
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:28,829
We need the money, Vin!

365
00:26:29,997 --> 00:26:32,416
The quality of mercy
is suddenly strained.

366
00:26:32,583 --> 00:26:34,919
I should sue these assholes!

367
00:26:35,086 --> 00:26:36,379
What's the word?

368
00:26:36,545 --> 00:26:38,839
Discrimination against
pregnant woman! Yes?

369
00:26:39,006 --> 00:26:41,801
I think you got a real good case.

370
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:43,636
This stupid bump
is costing me much money.

371
00:26:43,803 --> 00:26:46,430
Well, he's gonna cost you
a lot more pretty soon.

372
00:26:46,597 --> 00:26:48,182
It's not "he."

373
00:26:48,349 --> 00:26:49,600
It's a she?

374
00:26:49,767 --> 00:26:51,644
How I know this?

375
00:26:51,811 --> 00:26:53,396
I look like psychic to you?

376
00:26:53,562 --> 00:26:55,981
No, you don't.
But they have technology.

377
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:57,441
Yeah, I know what they have.

378
00:26:57,608 --> 00:27:00,528
Well,
maybe I call stripper employer

379
00:27:00,694 --> 00:27:03,155
and ask them to fax insurance card
to pay ultrasound.

380
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:05,491
Yes?

381
00:27:05,658 --> 00:27:07,993
So, the question I suppose is...

382
00:27:09,036 --> 00:27:11,372
what is a saint?
What is a saint?

383
00:27:11,539 --> 00:27:13,207
Does anybody know what a saint is?

384
00:27:13,374 --> 00:27:14,959
I don't think they do. Ooh, Rachel.

385
00:27:15,126 --> 00:27:18,838
Individuals who display and act
out of exceptional holiness.

386
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:20,798
That's pretty perfect.
Thank you, Rachel.

387
00:27:20,965 --> 00:27:22,591
Who can name a saint?

388
00:27:22,758 --> 00:27:24,427
- Jeremiah.
- Saint Jude?

389
00:27:24,593 --> 00:27:26,720
Saint Jude, yes.
And what is Saint Jude known for?

390
00:27:26,887 --> 00:27:29,557
Um, I think he owns a hospital, right?

391
00:27:30,891 --> 00:27:33,602
And a golf tournament, right?
That's what... Yeah, OK. Uh...

392
00:27:33,769 --> 00:27:36,188
Anyone know any modern-day saints?

393
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:37,523
Bridgette.

394
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,567
- Mother Teresa.
- Mother Teresa, yes.

395
00:27:39,733 --> 00:27:41,444
The big MT is a modern-day saint.

396
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:44,155
So, a saint is a human being

397
00:27:44,321 --> 00:27:47,575
we celebrate for their commitment
and dedication

398
00:27:47,741 --> 00:27:49,243
to other human beings,

399
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:52,204
for the sacrifices that they make,
for their hard work

400
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:55,708
in making the world a better place
for those around us

401
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:58,377
and for those who will follow them.

402
00:28:02,214 --> 00:28:03,215
Good night.

403
00:28:07,094 --> 00:28:09,138
- Maggie Bronstein?
- Hi.

404
00:28:09,305 --> 00:28:11,640
Robin called in sick.
Got six cases backed up.

405
00:28:11,807 --> 00:28:13,976
Yeah, I have to go
pick up my son, though, so...

406
00:28:14,143 --> 00:28:16,687
Sorry, can't let you clock out
without the shift being covered.

407
00:28:16,854 --> 00:28:17,938
Hospital policy.

408
00:28:18,147 --> 00:28:19,148
Oh...

409
00:28:30,367 --> 00:28:32,870
Come on, coward,
try to sell me something.

410
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:54,725
Yeah?

411
00:28:54,892 --> 00:28:57,019
- Vincent?
- You evil witch.

412
00:28:57,186 --> 00:29:00,147
I'm gonna listen to your whole
goddamn spiel,

413
00:29:00,314 --> 00:29:02,733
and then I'm gonna hang up.

414
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:06,070
- Vincent, it's Maggie.
- Maggie? That's a good one.

415
00:29:06,237 --> 00:29:09,823
Wait, is it Maggie from Calcutta,
or is it Maggie from New Delhi?

416
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,992
No, it's your neighbor, Maggie.

417
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,411
What the hell do you want?

418
00:29:24,505 --> 00:29:25,631
Let's go!

419
00:29:38,769 --> 00:29:40,771
You better buckle up.

420
00:29:41,564 --> 00:29:42,565
You're not buckled.

421
00:29:42,731 --> 00:29:44,775
My life is my problem.

422
00:29:47,736 --> 00:29:49,738
- This the way home?
- No.

423
00:29:50,781 --> 00:29:52,491
Hey, let's lay down some S.O.P.

424
00:29:52,658 --> 00:29:54,785
I don't know what S.O.P. means, sir.

425
00:29:54,952 --> 00:29:57,037
Standard operating procedure.

426
00:29:57,204 --> 00:30:00,291
You go where I go,
you do what I say,

427
00:30:00,457 --> 00:30:03,586
get your homework done somewhere
along the way, but most importantly,

428
00:30:03,752 --> 00:30:05,629
you don't annoy me.

429
00:30:05,796 --> 00:30:07,298
I am not happy when I'm annoyed.

430
00:30:07,464 --> 00:30:09,675
Are you annoyed right now?

431
00:30:11,302 --> 00:30:13,220
Not particularly.

432
00:30:14,471 --> 00:30:16,682
Really?

433
00:30:22,479 --> 00:30:23,689
Here's a dime.

434
00:30:23,856 --> 00:30:26,233
Call your mom,
tell her you're wearing your seat belt.

435
00:30:27,443 --> 00:30:28,611
It costs more than a dime.

436
00:30:28,777 --> 00:30:30,237
Since when?

437
00:30:30,404 --> 00:30:32,156
Since before I was born.

438
00:30:33,991 --> 00:30:36,160
What is this country coming to?

439
00:30:36,327 --> 00:30:37,745
Right here.

440
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:42,708
If it costs more than that,
call collect.

441
00:31:07,775 --> 00:31:10,819
- Hey, look. It's dipshit.
- You live in this neighborhood?

442
00:31:10,986 --> 00:31:13,405
I probably got detention
'cause of you, asshole.

443
00:31:13,572 --> 00:31:15,282
You got detention
'cause you took my stuff.

444
00:31:15,449 --> 00:31:18,327
How do you know I took it,
you narc?

445
00:31:19,328 --> 00:31:20,621
Oh, yeah!

446
00:31:23,082 --> 00:31:24,208
He Just slapped you!

447
00:31:25,709 --> 00:31:26,835
Stop!

448
00:31:31,674 --> 00:31:33,217
You got him.

449
00:31:35,803 --> 00:31:37,596
Listen, the next time the teachers
ask you what happened,

450
00:31:37,763 --> 00:31:39,139
you don't say anything! You got me?

451
00:31:39,306 --> 00:31:41,642
- Get off me!
- No! I don't care!

452
00:31:41,809 --> 00:31:44,186
So you can go crying
to your mommy! Cry...

453
00:31:44,353 --> 00:31:46,563
What are you little shit heels doing?

454
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:48,273
Is that you, Robert Ocinski?

455
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,234
No, sir. My name's John.

456
00:31:50,442 --> 00:31:51,902
Bullshit, you little prick.

457
00:31:52,069 --> 00:31:53,237
You're Briana's kid.

458
00:31:53,404 --> 00:31:56,240
Only Puerto Rican Polack in Brooklyn.

459
00:31:56,407 --> 00:31:59,326
Well, I got a deal
for you little bully shit heels.

460
00:31:59,493 --> 00:32:01,078
Whatever you do to this guy here,

461
00:32:01,245 --> 00:32:03,038
I'm gonna do to your mothers.

462
00:32:03,205 --> 00:32:05,666
You understand?
And in the meantime...

463
00:32:06,417 --> 00:32:07,418
ride this.

464
00:32:07,584 --> 00:32:10,379
- What the...
- Run!

465
00:32:10,546 --> 00:32:12,131
- Come on, let's get out, man!
- Run, you little...

466
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:13,257
Get out of here!

467
00:32:13,424 --> 00:32:15,008
Get moving, you little shits!

468
00:32:15,175 --> 00:32:17,428
Let's get out of here!
The old man's crazy!

469
00:32:21,974 --> 00:32:24,727
What, you waiting
for a paper invitation?

470
00:32:34,945 --> 00:32:36,697
Who taught you to slap?

471
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:38,907
I don't know, sir.
Just an instinct, I guess.

472
00:32:39,074 --> 00:32:41,618
Yeah, well, you need to unlearn that.

473
00:32:43,912 --> 00:32:45,038
I'm allergic, sir.

474
00:32:45,205 --> 00:32:46,874
To what?

475
00:32:48,041 --> 00:32:49,877
Cigarette smoke.

476
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:54,089
Your father never taught you
to defend yourself?

477
00:32:54,256 --> 00:32:56,175
No, sir. He's a pacifist.

478
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:59,553
Well, this country wasn't founded by
tree huggers, that's for sure.

479
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,139
No, you need to defend yourself,
or you get mowed down.

480
00:33:02,306 --> 00:33:04,516
I'm small, if you haven't noticed.

481
00:33:04,683 --> 00:33:07,978
- Yeah, so was Hitler.
- That's a horrible comparison.

482
00:33:08,145 --> 00:33:10,606
Indeed. Making a point, though.

483
00:33:10,773 --> 00:33:11,774
Small means nothing.

484
00:33:12,816 --> 00:33:14,067
It's what's in here.

485
00:33:16,487 --> 00:33:17,863
Or here, sir.

486
00:33:44,807 --> 00:33:47,226
OK, powerhouse.

487
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:49,645
Grab the basket.

488
00:34:05,536 --> 00:34:07,871
- Hey.
- Hey, Vin.

489
00:34:09,164 --> 00:34:11,625
This place is like a mansion.

490
00:34:11,792 --> 00:34:14,419
OK, when we get in there, no talking.

491
00:34:14,586 --> 00:34:16,421
Where are we going?

492
00:34:16,588 --> 00:34:20,551
You know, this is a great chance
for you to practice no talking.

493
00:34:21,802 --> 00:34:23,595
Come on.

494
00:34:25,097 --> 00:34:26,974
Sorry I'm late.

495
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:29,017
There you are, Doctor.

496
00:34:29,184 --> 00:34:30,727
Nice to see you, Sandy.

497
00:34:30,894 --> 00:34:32,312
How you feeling?

498
00:34:32,479 --> 00:34:34,273
Today is my birthday.

499
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:35,691
OK.

500
00:34:35,858 --> 00:34:37,693
Happy birthday.

501
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,695
What are you, 17?

502
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:43,407
Oh, will you put those things
in those drawers?

503
00:34:47,035 --> 00:34:49,037
All right, Sandy.

504
00:34:50,205 --> 00:34:52,749
Let's see how the old ticker's working.

505
00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:58,964
Can you... tell them I don't like...

506
00:34:59,131 --> 00:35:01,508
the green beans

507
00:35:01,675 --> 00:35:04,303
when they put the bacon bits

508
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:05,888
chopped up in there with them?

509
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:09,266
It's too greasy for me.

510
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:14,855
Will do, Sandy.

511
00:35:16,273 --> 00:35:18,400
Well, as near as I can tell...

512
00:35:19,234 --> 00:35:21,153
you're still beautiful.

513
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:26,909
Perhaps you require a second opinion
from my associate.

514
00:35:28,076 --> 00:35:29,411
Beautiful.

515
00:35:36,919 --> 00:35:38,712
You know, we can do
the laundry here, Vin.

516
00:35:38,879 --> 00:35:40,589
- We have a service.
- Thanks.

517
00:35:40,756 --> 00:35:42,257
It gives me something to do.

518
00:35:42,424 --> 00:35:43,383
Who's your helper?

519
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:45,844
Uh, he's 11 bucks an hour.

520
00:35:46,011 --> 00:35:48,055
It's Oliver, actually.

521
00:35:48,221 --> 00:35:49,973
Nice to meet you, Oliver. I'm Ana.

522
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:51,516
- Hi.
- Hi.

523
00:35:51,683 --> 00:35:52,726
OK, thanks.

524
00:35:52,893 --> 00:35:53,936
OK.

525
00:35:54,102 --> 00:35:55,437
Oh, wait.

526
00:35:55,604 --> 00:35:56,813
Uh...

527
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,607
She don't like the string beans.

528
00:35:58,774 --> 00:36:01,902
- I'll make a note. What's she prefer?
- Broccoli.

529
00:36:02,069 --> 00:36:04,237
Broccoli's good.

530
00:36:04,404 --> 00:36:07,407
- OK, thanks.
- Take care, Vin.

531
00:36:12,204 --> 00:36:13,914
And time.

532
00:36:15,916 --> 00:36:18,835
OK. Well, that's just gonna
get you beat up pretty bad.

533
00:36:19,002 --> 00:36:20,754
I don't want to fight, anyway.

534
00:36:20,921 --> 00:36:24,174
Well, nobody wants to fight. You know?
You think I wanted to go to war?

535
00:36:24,341 --> 00:36:26,969
You think an 18-year-old kid wants
to sit in a rice paddy

536
00:36:27,135 --> 00:36:29,596
- with bullets whizzing by his head?
- When was that?

537
00:36:29,763 --> 00:36:31,640
- Vietnam.
- You were there?

538
00:36:31,807 --> 00:36:33,266
I think I'm imagining it.

539
00:36:33,433 --> 00:36:37,145
All right, I'm gonna show you one thing,
and it's probably your best shot.

540
00:36:37,312 --> 00:36:39,648
If you do it right,
you can break the guy's nose.

541
00:36:39,815 --> 00:36:42,401
- Break his nose?
- Relax. You're not gonna get it right.

542
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:44,152
All right. OK.

543
00:36:44,319 --> 00:36:46,989
He's bigger than you,
so you get down below him like this,

544
00:36:47,155 --> 00:36:48,657
you squat like this...

545
00:36:48,824 --> 00:36:50,325
just crouch...

546
00:36:50,492 --> 00:36:52,327
and you stand up real hard,

547
00:36:52,494 --> 00:36:54,705
and you push all the way
through your legs,

548
00:36:54,871 --> 00:36:58,542
all the way up, your shoulders,
your butt, everything pushes up,

549
00:36:58,709 --> 00:37:02,504
and you push all the way up through that
arm and go whack, right in the snoot.

550
00:37:03,422 --> 00:37:05,257
Right? Try it on me. Ready?

551
00:37:11,805 --> 00:37:13,640
OK, but you got to do it
faster than that, right?

552
00:37:15,308 --> 00:37:16,268
Aah!

553
00:37:16,435 --> 00:37:18,061
OK. All right, now...

554
00:37:19,354 --> 00:37:20,480
Aah!

555
00:37:28,989 --> 00:37:30,615
Maggie Bronstein?

556
00:37:30,782 --> 00:37:32,659
- I have Mace!
- OK. Uh...

557
00:37:32,826 --> 00:37:36,371
I've got papers.
Kings County Family Court.

558
00:37:36,538 --> 00:37:38,457
As they say, you've been served.

559
00:37:57,726 --> 00:38:00,645
Yeah, I know you worked
some extra hours, so...

560
00:38:00,812 --> 00:38:02,814
I'm gonna cover it.

561
00:38:03,523 --> 00:38:04,983
I wasn't offering a discount.

562
00:38:09,029 --> 00:38:11,031
So, what have you been crying about?

563
00:38:11,198 --> 00:38:13,575
- It's a long story.
- OK.

564
00:38:13,742 --> 00:38:16,453
What's the punch line?

565
00:38:17,871 --> 00:38:19,331
My ex wants custody.

566
00:38:25,712 --> 00:38:28,131
There goes my job security.

567
00:38:34,805 --> 00:38:37,015
Thanks, you asshole.

568
00:38:38,809 --> 00:38:40,894
That could've gone either way.

569
00:38:41,061 --> 00:38:43,939
It's gonna be cold
for a second, OK?

570
00:38:44,106 --> 00:38:46,817
See there? That's the baby's head.

571
00:38:48,401 --> 00:38:50,278
This is very big head.

572
00:38:50,445 --> 00:38:52,447
Maybe good, no?

573
00:38:52,614 --> 00:38:54,783
It's the biggest part at this age.

574
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:58,662
And these... are her little legs.

575
00:39:00,247 --> 00:39:02,332
She?

576
00:39:02,499 --> 00:39:03,750
You didn't know?

577
00:39:03,917 --> 00:39:05,836
Sorry. Did you not want to know?

578
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,714
No. It's good to know.

579
00:39:16,346 --> 00:39:18,515
I couldn't verify with your insurance,
Mr. MacKenna.

580
00:39:18,682 --> 00:39:20,308
We are just married.

581
00:39:20,475 --> 00:39:22,060
- That happened.
- Really?

582
00:39:22,227 --> 00:39:24,855
Yeah, I told insurance.
You know how slow they are.

583
00:39:25,021 --> 00:39:28,525
I mean, the bureaucracy
and the paperwork.

584
00:39:28,692 --> 00:39:31,903
I mean, what is a co-pay running,
anyway?

585
00:39:33,113 --> 00:39:34,156
Twenty dollars.

586
00:39:35,157 --> 00:39:36,324
This is good price, no?

587
00:39:36,491 --> 00:39:38,952
For you, only the best.

588
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,163
You're worth it.

589
00:39:41,329 --> 00:39:42,789
Thank you, sugarplum.

590
00:39:42,956 --> 00:39:45,083
You owe me, lady.

591
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:46,626
- Here.
- Mmm-hmm.

592
00:39:47,878 --> 00:39:50,088
- See you later.
- OK. Take care of yourselves.

593
00:40:15,113 --> 00:40:16,364
Hey!

594
00:40:16,531 --> 00:40:19,326
- Hi, Ma.
- What are you doing?

595
00:40:19,492 --> 00:40:20,577
I'm mowing Vin's lawn.

596
00:40:20,744 --> 00:40:23,330
Well... Hey, Vin!

597
00:40:24,956 --> 00:40:26,875
I was sleeping. Thanks for that.

598
00:40:27,042 --> 00:40:29,377
Why is he mowing your dirt patch?

599
00:40:29,544 --> 00:40:31,171
Oh, yeah, he's paying me hourly.

600
00:40:31,338 --> 00:40:33,465
I'm showing him how the world works.

601
00:40:33,632 --> 00:40:36,176
You work, you get paid, you drink.

602
00:40:36,343 --> 00:40:38,220
Are you drinking alcohol?

603
00:40:41,514 --> 00:40:42,599
I honestly don't remember.

604
00:40:42,766 --> 00:40:45,101
All right, let's go.
I'm gonna make dinner.

605
00:40:45,268 --> 00:40:47,187
- You can do homework.
- I already ate.

606
00:40:47,354 --> 00:40:49,648
Stop mow... You're mowing dirt.
Let's go.

607
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:53,902
He's fed, the homework's checked,
I've done my job, I'm taking a break.

608
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,240
- Payday tomorrow.
- OK. Come on, let's... Leave it.

609
00:40:58,406 --> 00:40:59,866
There's no grass.

610
00:41:01,534 --> 00:41:03,662
Bye, Vin.

611
00:41:06,748 --> 00:41:08,083
Come on, come on.

612
00:41:11,544 --> 00:41:13,255
- You're out!
- Good luck.

613
00:41:13,421 --> 00:41:16,007
Get ready for a red ass,
you little shit bag.

614
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:18,301
- All right, we got him.
- Come on, come on.

615
00:41:23,598 --> 00:41:25,600
Missed it!

616
00:41:26,935 --> 00:41:28,436
Say your prayers, you little pussy.

617
00:41:36,278 --> 00:41:38,571
- What happened? What happened here?
- I don't know.

618
00:41:38,738 --> 00:41:39,990
- You don't know?
- It's not my fault.

619
00:41:40,156 --> 00:41:41,366
Let me see.

620
00:41:44,494 --> 00:41:47,163
You asshole, dick bag, son of a whore!

621
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:48,331
Whoa! Bronstein!

622
00:42:25,618 --> 00:42:27,620
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

623
00:42:27,787 --> 00:42:29,664
I am Daka.

624
00:42:29,831 --> 00:42:31,291
Who are you?

625
00:42:31,458 --> 00:42:34,544
- I'm Oliver.
- Oliver. Hm.

626
00:42:36,379 --> 00:42:38,465
Why you bang this door so much?

627
00:42:38,631 --> 00:42:40,175
He's hard of hearing!

628
00:42:40,342 --> 00:42:41,801
Let him in!

629
00:42:41,968 --> 00:42:43,887
Don't yell at me!

630
00:42:53,146 --> 00:42:55,523
You broke his nose?

631
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:57,692
Yes, sir, I think so.
There was blood everywhere.

632
00:42:57,859 --> 00:43:00,320
- You should've seen it.
- I wish I had.

633
00:43:00,487 --> 00:43:03,281
You must have got him
just right. Show me.

634
00:43:03,448 --> 00:43:04,449
OK.

635
00:43:04,783 --> 00:43:05,784
Ha-yah!

636
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:09,704
You teach him fighting?

637
00:43:09,871 --> 00:43:11,206
He's a little runt, you know?

638
00:43:11,373 --> 00:43:13,333
He's got to learn
how to defend himself.

639
00:43:14,876 --> 00:43:16,503
Fighting is for assholes.

640
00:43:18,129 --> 00:43:20,090
Where's my money?

641
00:43:21,216 --> 00:43:22,425
It's on the dresser.

642
00:43:24,094 --> 00:43:25,512
Minus the co-pay.

643
00:43:25,678 --> 00:43:27,764
You don't teach children.

644
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:28,973
Yah!

645
00:43:31,226 --> 00:43:32,268
Look at you.

646
00:43:37,982 --> 00:43:39,818
Breaking his nose!

647
00:43:41,528 --> 00:43:43,530
Who is she?

648
00:43:44,823 --> 00:43:46,991
A lady of the night.

649
00:43:47,158 --> 00:43:49,160
What's that?

650
00:43:49,327 --> 00:43:55,667
It's one of the more honest ways
to make a living.

651
00:44:05,552 --> 00:44:07,554
The board tells you
the action for the day,

652
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,764
race number, who's running,

653
00:44:09,931 --> 00:44:11,891
who's riding, and so forth.

654
00:44:12,058 --> 00:44:13,601
What's 20-slash-one?

655
00:44:13,768 --> 00:44:15,186
That's odds.

656
00:44:15,353 --> 00:44:16,896
Some bookie out of Vegas thinks

657
00:44:17,063 --> 00:44:19,315
that that horse has
a one-in-20 chance of winning.

658
00:44:19,482 --> 00:44:20,733
What do you get if he does?

659
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,193
20 times your money.

660
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,611
That's a good deal.

661
00:44:23,778 --> 00:44:25,572
If you win, sure.

662
00:44:28,032 --> 00:44:30,118
That one with the wraps is a dog.

663
00:44:30,285 --> 00:44:31,953
Doesn't sound like a compliment.

664
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:35,623
Not for a horse. No, the odds
of him winning are astronomical.

665
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:37,417
Long odds, bigger payout.

666
00:44:37,584 --> 00:44:39,961
We should take him
across the board.

667
00:44:41,546 --> 00:44:44,174
Well, don't get ahead of yourself, kid.

668
00:44:51,347 --> 00:44:53,433
- Are you praying?
- Praying?

669
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,726
That's what it looks like.

670
00:44:54,893 --> 00:44:56,811
I thought we talked about
you not talking.

671
00:44:56,978 --> 00:44:58,771
What's a trifecta?

672
00:45:02,775 --> 00:45:05,862
You pick, uh, three horses:
one, two, three,

673
00:45:06,029 --> 00:45:10,617
in the order they finish,
and it's a high risk, high reward.

674
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:12,160
Sounds improbable.

675
00:45:13,411 --> 00:45:17,248
Well, if you're gonna gamble, you might
as well have a chance to win big.

676
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:19,876
Uh, Harvey Knows Best,
Sweeter Lady,

677
00:45:20,043 --> 00:45:21,669
Champagne Flute.

678
00:45:21,836 --> 00:45:23,505
One, two, three.

679
00:45:23,671 --> 00:45:26,299
800-110-1.

680
00:45:26,466 --> 00:45:28,218
You got any money?

681
00:45:28,384 --> 00:45:29,511
Sure.

682
00:45:32,722 --> 00:45:33,723
Uh...

683
00:45:35,183 --> 00:45:37,602
- Seven dollars.
- What is that, lunch money?

684
00:45:37,769 --> 00:45:38,937
Yes, sir.

685
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:41,189
Well, you might as well
learn the hard way.

686
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:44,901
I'll throw in some, too.
That's called mitigation.

687
00:45:46,194 --> 00:45:48,446
What's... mitigation?

688
00:45:48,613 --> 00:45:51,741
That's where you throw in seven
and I throw in three.

689
00:45:56,204 --> 00:45:58,081
And they're off!

690
00:45:58,248 --> 00:46:01,292
Sweeter Lady takes the lead
by a length and a half...

691
00:46:01,459 --> 00:46:03,503
Come on. Come on.

692
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:05,255
...and here comes Harvey Knows Best!

693
00:46:06,923 --> 00:46:11,427
Harvey Knows Best making a final surge
as they come around for the line!

694
00:46:11,594 --> 00:46:12,762
This is ridiculous!

695
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:16,266
This is really happening!
Don't stop!

696
00:46:16,432 --> 00:46:18,309
Don't stop!

697
00:46:18,476 --> 00:46:20,728
Don't stop! Don't stop!

698
00:46:20,895 --> 00:46:22,146
This is ridiculous!

699
00:46:22,313 --> 00:46:23,606
- Yeah! Yeah!
- This is ridiculous!

700
00:46:23,773 --> 00:46:25,275
- Go! Go!
- Yeah!

701
00:46:25,441 --> 00:46:28,027
Don't stop! Just hang on, please!

702
00:46:28,194 --> 00:46:30,071
And it will be Harvey Knows Best

703
00:46:30,238 --> 00:46:33,992
followed by Sweeter Lady
and Champagne Flute.

704
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:38,496
- This isn't fair! It's not fair!
- We won, didn't we?

705
00:46:38,663 --> 00:46:40,540
Just roll with this,
just roll with this, man.

706
00:46:40,707 --> 00:46:43,751
Just roll with this,
and act like you didn't win it.

707
00:46:43,918 --> 00:46:47,589
- Shit!
- No, no, it didn't work for us.

708
00:46:47,755 --> 00:46:49,173
Do you understand me?

709
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:51,801
It didn't happen.
We didn't win at all.

710
00:46:51,968 --> 00:46:53,678
We didn't win anything, OK?

711
00:46:55,972 --> 00:46:58,349
Thank you.

712
00:47:41,601 --> 00:47:46,439
Good afternoon... Mr. MacKenna.

713
00:47:46,606 --> 00:47:48,858
I need to open up
a savings account for my grandson.

714
00:47:49,025 --> 00:47:49,984
Oh...

715
00:47:50,151 --> 00:47:52,945
And this'll get my account up to zero.

716
00:47:53,112 --> 00:47:55,323
Close me out
while you're tapping away over there.

717
00:47:56,949 --> 00:47:58,743
Don't ever become
a pencil pusher, kid.

718
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:00,870
They're spineless.

719
00:48:40,159 --> 00:48:41,160
Hello, Mrs. Bronstein.

720
00:48:41,327 --> 00:48:46,082
This is Dan O'Brien,
principal here at St. Patrick.

721
00:48:46,582 --> 00:48:47,500
Uh...

722
00:48:47,667 --> 00:48:53,005
A few days ago, your son, Oliver,
was involved in a fight at school.

723
00:48:53,172 --> 00:48:55,717
- We've tried to reach you...
- What?

724
00:48:57,927 --> 00:48:59,429
If you're a telemarketer,

725
00:48:59,595 --> 00:49:02,265
please leave a message
so I can not return your call.

726
00:49:03,766 --> 00:49:05,351
Vin.

727
00:49:05,518 --> 00:49:07,437
Vin? Oliver?

728
00:49:08,229 --> 00:49:10,356
Oliver, it's Mom. Pick up.

729
00:49:11,274 --> 00:49:12,859
Hello?

730
00:49:16,028 --> 00:49:17,864
You want another?

731
00:49:18,698 --> 00:49:19,741
Yes, please.

732
00:49:19,907 --> 00:49:21,951
Go for it. We're living today.

733
00:49:23,828 --> 00:49:25,163
Excuse me, sir?

734
00:49:26,456 --> 00:49:28,833
You kids. Damn small talkers.

735
00:49:29,625 --> 00:49:32,253
There's no point in yapping
if no one's listening.

736
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:35,923
- Let's hear it.
- Excuse me, sir!

737
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:38,593
You can't get nothing in this world
without being heard.

738
00:49:40,553 --> 00:49:42,138
Another Coke, please.

739
00:49:42,305 --> 00:49:43,765
And you can hit me, too, Rog.

740
00:49:43,931 --> 00:49:45,391
We're out of your bourbon.

741
00:49:45,558 --> 00:49:47,185
You cleaned me out.

742
00:49:48,853 --> 00:49:52,857
Rog... don't lie to me. Be a man.

743
00:49:53,024 --> 00:49:56,068
Vin. And he's not supposed
to be sitting at the bar.

744
00:49:56,235 --> 00:49:59,197
You're right. We're gonna go
somewhere else to spend our money.

745
00:49:59,363 --> 00:50:03,117
Hey, he's only doing
his job there, Vin.

746
00:50:03,284 --> 00:50:04,243
Be nice.

747
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:05,578
Oh!

748
00:50:05,745 --> 00:50:06,954
Damn!

749
00:50:09,081 --> 00:50:11,125
- Amber, get the first-aid kit.
- OK.

750
00:50:11,292 --> 00:50:13,419
But it's just a cut.
I got lots of 'em.

751
00:50:13,586 --> 00:50:15,838
Here, here.

752
00:50:16,005 --> 00:50:18,382
Man, you're bleeding
all over the bar.

753
00:50:18,549 --> 00:50:21,093
That's fine.
Kid's got to do homework.

754
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:22,512
Come on, let's go.

755
00:50:47,203 --> 00:50:49,372
- Hi, Mom.
- Where were you?

756
00:50:49,539 --> 00:50:51,082
Where the hell is your car, Vin?

757
00:50:51,249 --> 00:50:53,084
- It broke down.
- Broke down.

758
00:50:53,251 --> 00:50:55,086
Oh, it broke down? Really?

759
00:50:55,795 --> 00:50:59,131
I don't appreciate you
taking him anywhere without asking me.

760
00:50:59,966 --> 00:51:01,133
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

761
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:04,345
Could you not be a smart-ass,
just for once? OK?

762
00:51:04,512 --> 00:51:07,765
I want to know where my son is
at all times, OK?

763
00:51:07,932 --> 00:51:10,393
- We just went to... eat.
- He should starve?

764
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,061
Go in the house, Oliver.

765
00:51:12,228 --> 00:51:14,939
- Mom...
- Go in the house, Oliver.

766
00:51:15,106 --> 00:51:16,774
Good night, Vin.

767
00:51:16,941 --> 00:51:18,943
Yeah, we'll see about that.

768
00:51:20,361 --> 00:51:22,655
You know, he's getting in fights
at school. Did you know that?

769
00:51:22,822 --> 00:51:24,282
Yeah, he mentioned something like that.

770
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:26,325
Yeah? Well, he didn't mention
anything to me about it.

771
00:51:26,492 --> 00:51:30,121
Oh, well, maybe you haven't noticed,
but you haven't been home much.

772
00:51:30,288 --> 00:51:33,207
It's difficult to have a conversation
with someone that's not here.

773
00:51:33,374 --> 00:51:34,542
Oh, we're gonna do that?

774
00:51:35,543 --> 00:51:38,212
God, I love when somebody like you
tells somebody like me advice,

775
00:51:38,379 --> 00:51:39,380
especially on parenting.

776
00:51:39,547 --> 00:51:41,173
I didn't sign on for the hormones,
dearie,

777
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:43,467
so that's gonna cost you
15 bucks an hour.

778
00:51:43,634 --> 00:51:45,177
You know why you never had kids?

779
00:51:45,344 --> 00:51:48,764
Because you don't want to think
about anybody other than yourself.

780
00:51:48,931 --> 00:51:51,809
What do you know about me, really?

781
00:51:52,894 --> 00:51:54,353
Tell me. I'd love it.

782
00:51:55,646 --> 00:51:58,357
Nothing. I don't know a thing about you,
just the way you want it.

783
00:51:58,524 --> 00:52:01,319
Then you can act like a prick
and it keeps everybody away.

784
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:04,196
If it ain't broken...

785
00:52:04,363 --> 00:52:06,407
It is broken, Vin.
Take a look at it.

786
00:52:06,574 --> 00:52:08,868
All right, I'm at 40 hours
for this week.

787
00:52:09,035 --> 00:52:11,329
At 41, I go to time and a half.

788
00:52:13,539 --> 00:52:15,499
Excuse me, is someone gonna pay me?

789
00:52:18,252 --> 00:52:21,172
You've got to be kidding me.

790
00:52:23,299 --> 00:52:25,301
I can't even say these words.

791
00:52:25,468 --> 00:52:26,928
They're creative.

792
00:52:27,678 --> 00:52:30,598
- Yes.
- That's one way to put it.

793
00:52:30,765 --> 00:52:35,144
Well, uh...
adjusting to a new school

794
00:52:35,311 --> 00:52:37,188
- is tough on children at this age.
- Yep.

795
00:52:37,355 --> 00:52:39,607
At any age, really,
and I don't want to minimize that.

796
00:52:39,774 --> 00:52:45,571
But is there anything else going on
that we should be aware of?

797
00:52:45,738 --> 00:52:48,449
Oh, I wouldn't even know
where to start.

798
00:52:48,616 --> 00:52:50,576
- How about his father?
- Well,

799
00:52:50,743 --> 00:52:52,078
I don't want to take up
all your time.

800
00:52:53,329 --> 00:52:55,039
We have loads of time.

801
00:52:58,209 --> 00:53:00,628
We're in the middle of a divorce.

802
00:53:00,795 --> 00:53:04,173
Oliver's father was having
an affair with his assistant,

803
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:05,800
and our accountant,

804
00:53:05,967 --> 00:53:09,303
and my hairdresser,
while she was still doing my hair,

805
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:11,055
so that was fun.

806
00:53:11,222 --> 00:53:13,474
And now he's filed for custody
of Oliver,

807
00:53:13,641 --> 00:53:15,393
full custody.

808
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:17,937
And he won't pay any support
until he gets what he wants.

809
00:53:18,104 --> 00:53:20,189
- Plus, he's a lawyer.
- Shit.

810
00:53:20,356 --> 00:53:23,109
So I just had to get out of there
as fast as I could,

811
00:53:23,275 --> 00:53:24,652
and I took Oliver with me,

812
00:53:24,819 --> 00:53:26,320
and I got a job at Mission Hills.

813
00:53:26,487 --> 00:53:28,280
I'm a CAT scan tech.

814
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:32,827
So I just see... really rough stuff
all day.

815
00:53:32,994 --> 00:53:35,287
You know, cancer and tumors

816
00:53:35,454 --> 00:53:38,582
and cysts and clots,
and I see what I'm looking at,

817
00:53:38,749 --> 00:53:41,127
but I can't tell,
you know, the people

818
00:53:41,293 --> 00:53:44,630
that are laying there,
so that's... miserable all day.

819
00:53:44,797 --> 00:53:46,007
And I work really late,

820
00:53:46,173 --> 00:53:50,845
because I'm trying
to get our act together.

821
00:53:52,638 --> 00:53:56,142
That's why he's here,
so he can have a good education,

822
00:53:56,308 --> 00:54:00,271
and I'm trying to just give him
a semi-normal life,

823
00:54:00,438 --> 00:54:05,192
and I'm dealing with this shit
from David and... custody.

824
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:07,361
I'm sorry about swearing.

825
00:54:09,488 --> 00:54:13,159
I know he didn't even want kids.

826
00:54:13,325 --> 00:54:14,452
He didn't want them.

827
00:54:14,618 --> 00:54:16,954
He's just doing this
so I'm not happy.

828
00:54:17,121 --> 00:54:18,914
You know Oliver's adopted.

829
00:54:19,081 --> 00:54:20,708
- Did you know that?
- I didn't.

830
00:54:20,875 --> 00:54:22,209
I don't know how you would,
but he is.

831
00:54:22,376 --> 00:54:27,423
And... I cannot have... kids.

832
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:30,259
You know, something about
my fallopian tubes being twisted.

833
00:54:30,426 --> 00:54:32,720
I think, what I really think,

834
00:54:32,887 --> 00:54:36,098
is that they were just recoiling
from David's sperm.

835
00:54:37,433 --> 00:54:40,061
Can I... Can I just have one?

836
00:54:40,227 --> 00:54:41,937
Thank you. Thank you for that.

837
00:54:42,104 --> 00:54:47,526
So I just think that all of this
has kind of permeated, you know,

838
00:54:47,693 --> 00:54:50,029
Oliver's whole little being, right?

839
00:54:50,196 --> 00:54:52,031
I mean, it has to.

840
00:54:52,198 --> 00:54:54,408
He's like a little,
like a little sponge.

841
00:54:54,575 --> 00:54:56,952
My real name's Robert.

842
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:58,370
Ocinski's my last name.

843
00:54:59,538 --> 00:55:02,124
People call me that ever since Geraghty
called me that last year.

844
00:55:02,291 --> 00:55:05,044
Now everyone calls me that.

845
00:55:05,211 --> 00:55:07,588
It's not like I can
go around and tell them,

846
00:55:07,755 --> 00:55:09,799
"Hey, dickwad,
don't call me Ocinski.

847
00:55:09,965 --> 00:55:11,717
My name's Robert."

848
00:55:11,884 --> 00:55:14,553
'Cause I would spend
my whole life doing that.

849
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,347
You taking a wiz?

850
00:55:16,514 --> 00:55:18,349
Sorry, can't hold it.

851
00:55:19,892 --> 00:55:21,477
Robert was my dad's name.

852
00:55:21,644 --> 00:55:23,771
So I'm a junior.

853
00:55:23,938 --> 00:55:25,231
He's not around, though.

854
00:55:25,397 --> 00:55:28,234
I don't really know him,
'cause he left when I was a baby.

855
00:55:29,819 --> 00:55:31,695
Yeah, my dad's not around, either.

856
00:55:31,862 --> 00:55:34,907
He did some bad things to my mom,
so we left him.

857
00:55:35,074 --> 00:55:37,326
Haven't seen him in a while.

858
00:55:38,828 --> 00:55:42,373
I kind of miss him, though.
My mom's being a jerk.

859
00:55:43,624 --> 00:55:44,625
They do that, man.

860
00:55:58,097 --> 00:56:01,851
Hey, uh, your dad the one
that taught you how to fight?

861
00:56:02,017 --> 00:56:03,978
No, my babysitter.

862
00:56:05,771 --> 00:56:08,524
Tide comes in twice a day, Doctor.

863
00:56:09,066 --> 00:56:12,278
Yeah, that's the tide,
comes and goes.

864
00:56:14,155 --> 00:56:15,948
I can't wait for autumn.

865
00:56:17,241 --> 00:56:19,493
They plant the most beautiful mums
all around the water.

866
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:22,580
- Yeah?
- Every color you can imagine.

867
00:56:22,746 --> 00:56:24,874
I don't know where they get them all.

868
00:56:26,167 --> 00:56:27,835
At the garden store.

869
00:56:30,713 --> 00:56:33,090
You've always been so funny, Vin.

870
00:56:34,341 --> 00:56:36,177
Vin?

871
00:56:36,343 --> 00:56:38,721
Vin, it's Vin, Sandy.

872
00:56:43,851 --> 00:56:44,894
The ducks eat them, though.

873
00:56:46,896 --> 00:56:48,689
We have to shoo them away.

874
00:56:48,856 --> 00:56:51,942
It's such a shame.

875
00:56:53,194 --> 00:56:55,154
It's a shame.

876
00:57:00,951 --> 00:57:04,496
There's plenty of affordable
health care options, Vin.

877
00:57:04,663 --> 00:57:06,332
I'm sure you know that.

878
00:57:06,498 --> 00:57:07,541
Sunnyside is pricey.

879
00:57:07,708 --> 00:57:10,127
Not for everyone.

880
00:57:11,045 --> 00:57:13,839
Well, my Sandy gets the best.

881
00:57:14,006 --> 00:57:16,300
I just, I'll just have to figure it out.

882
00:57:16,467 --> 00:57:18,260
I understand that,
but you're months behind,

883
00:57:18,427 --> 00:57:21,347
and we are not in the credit business,
as you know.

884
00:57:21,513 --> 00:57:25,017
- What's that mean?
- We need payment in full

885
00:57:25,184 --> 00:57:26,685
and three months in advance.

886
00:57:26,852 --> 00:57:28,020
Got it.

887
00:57:28,187 --> 00:57:29,271
By next week.

888
00:57:29,438 --> 00:57:32,024
- Next week?
- Yeah, next week.

889
00:57:35,611 --> 00:57:38,155
Well, I can give you 20 percent...

890
00:57:39,698 --> 00:57:43,327
- in good faith?
- Vin, we're past good faith. I'm sorry.

891
00:57:44,119 --> 00:57:46,705
We will transfer Sandy
wherever you want to put her.

892
00:57:46,872 --> 00:57:48,624
Put her?

893
00:57:48,791 --> 00:57:51,335
That's it or we get the boot?

894
00:57:52,169 --> 00:57:55,256
I don't think that's the best way
to phrase what's happening.

895
00:57:55,422 --> 00:57:58,217
OK, what's the best way
to phrase it?

896
00:57:59,134 --> 00:58:00,719
It is what it is.

897
00:58:03,347 --> 00:58:05,975
Let's get some new plants
for the room, OK?

898
00:58:06,141 --> 00:58:08,519
I can have the desk order something.

899
00:58:08,686 --> 00:58:11,188
Well, I was hoping maybe for mums.

900
00:58:11,355 --> 00:58:13,190
Sure.

901
00:58:13,357 --> 00:58:15,901
And here's a little something
for your trouble.

902
00:58:16,068 --> 00:58:18,821
Oh, no. Vin, this is my job.
I take care of people. Please.

903
00:58:18,988 --> 00:58:22,199
- You go way beyond your job, Ana.
- Oh!

904
00:58:22,366 --> 00:58:24,868
You've been an angel to my Sandy.

905
00:58:25,035 --> 00:58:26,912
OK, Vin. We don't
make a habit now, OK?

906
00:58:27,079 --> 00:58:29,373
It can't happen, I'm shit broke.

907
00:58:31,583 --> 00:58:32,751
You got a nice smile.

908
00:58:32,918 --> 00:58:34,503
You should do it more often.

909
00:58:34,670 --> 00:58:35,754
I'll get the laundry.

910
00:58:52,646 --> 00:58:53,939
There you go.

911
00:58:57,568 --> 00:58:58,569
It's a lot lighter.

912
00:58:59,737 --> 00:59:01,530
She didn't change much this week.

913
00:59:03,032 --> 00:59:05,576
Well... easy on my back.

914
00:59:07,202 --> 00:59:09,997
- Thanks.
- Behave yourself, Vin.

915
00:59:21,967 --> 00:59:23,552
He'll pay hundred dollars.

916
00:59:23,719 --> 00:59:26,597
$100? I pay more than that
for one prescription.

917
00:59:26,764 --> 00:59:30,059
He said this is for epilepsy,

918
00:59:30,225 --> 00:59:31,643
for prostate flaring,

919
00:59:31,810 --> 00:59:34,146
and to soften the shitting.

920
00:59:34,313 --> 00:59:36,065
That should have some value.

921
00:59:36,231 --> 00:59:37,941
For who? You?

922
00:59:38,275 --> 00:59:39,234
Eh.

923
00:59:39,401 --> 00:59:41,070
We need the... I need the dough.

924
00:59:42,071 --> 00:59:43,655
I... 500 bucks!

925
00:59:43,822 --> 00:59:45,407
This is all high-dollar shit.

926
00:59:45,574 --> 00:59:47,284
He said 100, Vin.

927
00:59:47,451 --> 00:59:48,452
You take it or leave this.

928
00:59:48,619 --> 00:59:50,621
You can't sell this to get high.

929
00:59:52,956 --> 00:59:55,209
I'll take a hundred.

930
00:59:57,753 --> 00:59:59,088
Oh, you'll take a hundred?

931
00:59:59,254 --> 01:00:00,881
Stupid...

932
01:00:16,063 --> 01:00:17,773
Hello there.

933
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:20,651
- Your account's closed, Mr. MacKenna.
- Yeah, I know that.

934
01:00:20,818 --> 01:00:24,196
This withdraw is on my grandson's
account. I think I'm on it.

935
01:00:26,615 --> 01:00:27,616
How much, sir?

936
01:00:28,909 --> 01:00:30,160
What's the balance?

937
01:00:32,830 --> 01:00:35,124
$2,700.

938
01:00:39,795 --> 01:00:41,171
I'll take all that.

939
01:00:41,338 --> 01:00:42,714
How would you like that?

940
01:00:42,881 --> 01:00:44,800
Hundreds, please.

941
01:00:50,681 --> 01:00:52,015
It's $2,700, Larry.

942
01:00:52,182 --> 01:00:55,644
I want a $450 trifecta box
in the third, OK?

943
01:00:55,811 --> 01:00:56,979
I want one, two, three:

944
01:00:57,146 --> 01:00:59,815
Lucky Lincoln, New Dime,
Sammy's Savior.

945
01:01:01,483 --> 01:01:03,193
Thank you, sir.

946
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:04,778
This is gonna make it all better.

947
01:01:04,945 --> 01:01:05,988
OK.

948
01:01:07,906 --> 01:01:11,160
New Dime drops back
to sixth, while back on the rail,

949
01:01:11,326 --> 01:01:13,579
Lucky Lincoln trails well behind,

950
01:01:13,745 --> 01:01:15,873
five lengths behind the rest
of the pack.

951
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:37,978
You all right, hon?

952
01:01:40,856 --> 01:01:42,232
No, I'm not.

953
01:02:41,166 --> 01:02:44,628
You must think I'm not
a very serious person, Vinny.

954
01:02:45,379 --> 01:02:46,880
You have no right to be here.

955
01:02:47,047 --> 01:02:48,340
You find anything good?

956
01:02:48,507 --> 01:02:51,510
No, some old jewelry.
Not worth much.

957
01:02:51,677 --> 01:02:54,555
That's my wife's,
you son of a bitch.

958
01:02:54,721 --> 01:02:56,056
You owe me money.

959
01:03:00,310 --> 01:03:01,853
Come on, Vinny!

960
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:05,190
Why do you always
have to do things the hard way?

961
01:03:05,357 --> 01:03:06,900
It's more interesting.

962
01:03:07,067 --> 01:03:08,610
And a lot more painful.

963
01:03:08,777 --> 01:03:12,531
All right, let's do.

964
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:15,367
Son of a bitch is crazy.

965
01:03:15,534 --> 01:03:18,620
Don't kill him,
but bring him close to it.

966
01:03:20,455 --> 01:03:21,582
What the... Oh!

967
01:03:25,419 --> 01:03:27,129
What are you doing, old man?

968
01:03:28,213 --> 01:03:29,464
He's dying, dude.

969
01:03:29,631 --> 01:03:31,550
No, he's not. He's...

970
01:03:40,183 --> 01:03:41,852
Don't touch nothing, let's just go.

971
01:03:42,394 --> 01:03:43,770
Let's just go.

972
01:04:25,937 --> 01:04:27,606
Vin?

973
01:04:29,149 --> 01:04:30,609
Vin?

974
01:04:36,156 --> 01:04:37,199
Vin, it's Maggie.

975
01:04:37,366 --> 01:04:39,117
We're gonna put you
in this machine,

976
01:04:39,284 --> 01:04:42,162
and we're gonna take some tests,
and it's not gonna hurt a bit.

977
01:04:42,329 --> 01:04:43,413
He can't understand you, Maggie.

978
01:04:46,583 --> 01:04:50,170
OK, there he is. There he is. OK.
It's just gonna be a couple minutes.

979
01:05:13,026 --> 01:05:15,779
Hey, there's my brave little man.

980
01:05:15,946 --> 01:05:18,907
Is he OK? I thought he was dead.

981
01:05:19,074 --> 01:05:20,409
He was just lying there.

982
01:05:20,575 --> 01:05:22,786
Yeah, that's what it looks like.

983
01:05:22,953 --> 01:05:25,497
Well, he looks like that
when he's drunk, too, so...

984
01:05:25,664 --> 01:05:28,875
I don't even know
what you're doing anymore.

985
01:05:29,042 --> 01:05:32,671
I know what I'm doing, and your father's
gonna have a field day with this.

986
01:05:32,838 --> 01:05:35,382
I wouldn't be here instead of with you
if it wasn't for him,

987
01:05:35,549 --> 01:05:37,467
- yet I'm gonna get...
- Mom. Mom. We're doing good.

988
01:05:37,634 --> 01:05:40,345
You're working hard every day,
and we need the money.

989
01:05:40,512 --> 01:05:41,888
It's all right.

990
01:05:42,055 --> 01:05:43,890
OK.

991
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:48,311
What's wrong with him, anyway?

992
01:05:52,065 --> 01:05:53,775
Think he's had a stroke.

993
01:05:56,653 --> 01:05:59,114
Slowly.

994
01:05:59,281 --> 01:06:00,741
Down, down, down, down, down.

995
01:06:00,907 --> 01:06:02,367
Good, good, bend the knees.

996
01:06:03,493 --> 01:06:05,746
Flat back. Good, good.

997
01:06:06,163 --> 01:06:07,706
Bend the knees.
Little bit, little bit.

998
01:06:08,582 --> 01:06:09,958
All right, all right, good.

999
01:06:10,125 --> 01:06:11,877
I chose Saint William of Rochester,

1000
01:06:12,043 --> 01:06:14,588
the patron saint of adopted children.

1001
01:06:14,755 --> 01:06:16,465
It's a pretty interesting story.

1002
01:06:16,631 --> 01:06:19,009
All the other saints
I looked at were all so...

1003
01:06:19,926 --> 01:06:21,136
saintly, I guess.

1004
01:06:21,303 --> 01:06:23,180
What does saintly mean to you?

1005
01:06:23,346 --> 01:06:24,765
I don't know.

1006
01:06:24,931 --> 01:06:27,350
I don't really believe in saints
and all that.

1007
01:06:27,517 --> 01:06:30,103
I feel like Saint William
just got to be a saint

1008
01:06:30,270 --> 01:06:33,148
'cause he was killed
by the boy he adopted.

1009
01:06:33,315 --> 01:06:35,859
These days, people get killed
all the time,

1010
01:06:36,026 --> 01:06:37,944
and they don't get to be
a saint for it.

1011
01:06:38,111 --> 01:06:40,113
All right, well, thanks, Oliver.

1012
01:06:42,532 --> 01:06:44,159
Despite young Oliver's resistance,

1013
01:06:44,326 --> 01:06:48,663
I do happen to believe that there are
saints all around us today.

1014
01:06:48,830 --> 01:06:51,708
They may never be considered
as such by religion,

1015
01:06:51,875 --> 01:06:54,795
but they are just as important
as the ones in your textbooks.

1016
01:06:54,961 --> 01:06:59,800
Thus, you are going to research
someone you know, or know of,

1017
01:06:59,966 --> 01:07:04,179
and determine if they have
the qualities fit for sainthood.

1018
01:07:07,098 --> 01:07:09,726
Where is he? His car is here.

1019
01:07:09,893 --> 01:07:11,228
He's in the hospital.

1020
01:07:11,394 --> 01:07:13,355
For what?

1021
01:07:13,522 --> 01:07:15,732
So, how do you and Vincent
know each other?

1022
01:07:16,983 --> 01:07:18,693
I'm working for this man.

1023
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:20,779
Oh, doing what?

1024
01:07:22,030 --> 01:07:23,865
Working.

1025
01:07:24,783 --> 01:07:25,951
I'm also dancer.

1026
01:07:28,036 --> 01:07:31,039
Wow, that... sounds exciting.

1027
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,126
Try to sound it out.

1028
01:07:37,504 --> 01:07:39,381
Not quite.

1029
01:07:39,673 --> 01:07:41,383
Well, you didn't lose
your sense of humor.

1030
01:07:42,926 --> 01:07:44,928
Hey, Vincent,
you've got some visitors.

1031
01:07:45,095 --> 01:07:46,763
I stay five minutes only.

1032
01:07:46,930 --> 01:07:49,140
Hospital is shit place.

1033
01:07:49,307 --> 01:07:50,934
You look a lot better, Vin.

1034
01:07:52,227 --> 01:07:53,979
Get this...

1035
01:07:55,564 --> 01:07:57,607
dipshit out of here.

1036
01:07:57,774 --> 01:07:59,025
What'd you say?

1037
01:08:01,862 --> 01:08:03,738
Get...

1038
01:08:03,905 --> 01:08:05,824
Get this...

1039
01:08:06,992 --> 01:08:08,577
All right.

1040
01:08:10,537 --> 01:08:13,707
How about we just
give Vin some time to do his therapy?

1041
01:08:13,874 --> 01:08:15,250
Thank you. We'll be about an hour.

1042
01:08:15,417 --> 01:08:16,918
Go to hell!

1043
01:08:17,085 --> 01:08:19,754
- An hour.
- Maybe less.

1044
01:08:19,921 --> 01:08:22,382
Why you so mean?
You could stop breathing.

1045
01:08:22,549 --> 01:08:24,634
- Asshole.
- OK, how about we get...

1046
01:08:24,801 --> 01:08:26,636
Hey, we're getting a snack.
Want a snack?

1047
01:08:26,803 --> 01:08:29,306
- Yes, I'm starving.
- Let's get a snack.

1048
01:08:31,099 --> 01:08:35,103
You know, they do think that his muscles
in his mouth will respond to therapy,

1049
01:08:35,270 --> 01:08:36,521
so that's good.

1050
01:08:36,688 --> 01:08:40,025
- He sounds...
- Like the retard.

1051
01:08:40,191 --> 01:08:42,569
Well, he's stupid man anyway.

1052
01:08:42,736 --> 01:08:45,030
So the retard is not far from.

1053
01:08:45,196 --> 01:08:47,073
Do you have dollar?

1054
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:49,784
I'm starving. I ate nothing today.

1055
01:08:51,202 --> 01:08:54,831
Yeah, I probably have... something.

1056
01:08:58,835 --> 01:09:00,462
Maybe dollar-half is better.

1057
01:09:02,547 --> 01:09:03,924
All right.

1058
01:09:10,639 --> 01:09:12,641
Is that Vin's...

1059
01:09:12,807 --> 01:09:14,309
- Baby?
- Yeah.

1060
01:09:14,476 --> 01:09:16,978
I like to stay away
from the whole situation.

1061
01:09:19,439 --> 01:09:21,983
It's not polite to ask a woman
if she's pregnant.

1062
01:09:22,150 --> 01:09:25,570
Well, I think it's pretty obvious
that she's pregnant.

1063
01:09:25,737 --> 01:09:28,448
Vin's, like, 90-something, Mom.
That would be inappropriate.

1064
01:09:28,615 --> 01:09:30,617
Hey, if you hit this machine
as first candy drops,

1065
01:09:30,784 --> 01:09:33,828
you can get two to come down.
It's good, no?

1066
01:09:33,995 --> 01:09:35,914
Thank you.

1067
01:09:39,709 --> 01:09:41,336
Oh, OK.

1068
01:09:50,303 --> 01:09:52,180
Hold on second.

1069
01:09:55,892 --> 01:09:59,270
Don't eat fast, stupid cat.

1070
01:10:00,522 --> 01:10:02,273
I...

1071
01:10:03,441 --> 01:10:07,487
I want fresh crap.

1072
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:11,866
Crab.

1073
01:10:12,033 --> 01:10:14,035
Not crap.

1074
01:10:14,202 --> 01:10:16,955
Crab.

1075
01:10:17,122 --> 01:10:19,207
Not crap.

1076
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:44,024
OK.

1077
01:10:44,190 --> 01:10:45,859
Money.

1078
01:10:47,777 --> 01:10:50,196
No, it's a... it's a T.

1079
01:10:51,322 --> 01:10:53,533
- Tree. Tree.
- You owe me money.

1080
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:55,910
- It's a tree. All right.
- Yeah, you broke my tree.

1081
01:10:56,536 --> 01:10:58,955
- I know.
- Yeah, you broke my fence, too.

1082
01:11:00,373 --> 01:11:02,667
OK, what, are you planting these?

1083
01:11:02,834 --> 01:11:04,377
Here, this should be familiar.

1084
01:11:04,544 --> 01:11:05,879
Cactus.

1085
01:11:06,046 --> 01:11:08,506
No, prick.

1086
01:11:08,673 --> 01:11:10,425
Big prick.

1087
01:11:40,163 --> 01:11:42,082
Wonderful, wonderful.

1088
01:11:49,881 --> 01:11:51,424
Daka...

1089
01:11:52,675 --> 01:11:54,469
is beautiful.

1090
01:11:56,971 --> 01:12:01,267
I know you just want special massage
or something, a dance later.

1091
01:12:01,434 --> 01:12:05,021
Don't try charming.
It doesn't work.

1092
01:12:08,399 --> 01:12:09,859
Don't worry, OK?

1093
01:12:10,026 --> 01:12:11,903
It's going to get better.

1094
01:12:21,037 --> 01:12:22,372
Still there?

1095
01:12:25,250 --> 01:12:27,127
- Wait.
- Sucker!

1096
01:12:32,674 --> 01:12:34,926
Down the stretch they come!

1097
01:12:38,930 --> 01:12:40,640
I'm sorry.

1098
01:13:00,410 --> 01:13:04,289
Where's... all my dirt?

1099
01:13:22,432 --> 01:13:23,725
My name's Regina.

1100
01:13:25,185 --> 01:13:26,394
Keep clean this house.

1101
01:13:29,272 --> 01:13:30,565
What's all that?

1102
01:13:30,732 --> 01:13:31,733
Vegetables.

1103
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:33,443
Get out of that!

1104
01:13:34,944 --> 01:13:36,905
You don't know this, vegetables?

1105
01:13:38,156 --> 01:13:40,283
I do, but...

1106
01:13:42,368 --> 01:13:44,412
I don't eat them.

1107
01:13:44,579 --> 01:13:48,833
You do now. And you pay me
for the hours now, Papa, OK?

1108
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,169
What... for?

1109
01:13:51,336 --> 01:13:52,754
I take care of you.

1110
01:13:52,921 --> 01:13:55,715
And we don't bump the ugly parts
no more, OK? So don't ask.

1111
01:13:55,882 --> 01:13:57,508
You're too old for this.

1112
01:13:57,675 --> 01:13:59,510
And I'm too fat.

1113
01:13:59,677 --> 01:14:01,888
$15 for the hours.

1114
01:14:02,055 --> 01:14:04,015
Plus room and food.

1115
01:14:04,807 --> 01:14:06,643
I'll get my secret pickles.

1116
01:14:08,519 --> 01:14:10,480
OK.

1117
01:14:10,855 --> 01:14:13,149
Who is Vincent MacKenna?

1118
01:14:13,608 --> 01:14:16,444
- You know him?
- Yes, he's my neighbor.

1119
01:14:16,611 --> 01:14:18,488
And he sometimes watches Oliver.

1120
01:14:18,655 --> 01:14:21,115
Your Honor,
he's my client's neighbor.

1121
01:14:21,282 --> 01:14:23,868
He occasionally watches Oliver,
sometimes.

1122
01:14:24,035 --> 01:14:25,536
He's your babysitter?

1123
01:14:26,955 --> 01:14:28,831
Yeah, I mean, sort of.

1124
01:14:28,998 --> 01:14:30,541
I Day him.

1125
01:14:30,708 --> 01:14:33,878
Oliver, you know, goes over there
for a few hours after school

1126
01:14:34,045 --> 01:14:35,505
when I'm still at work.

1127
01:14:35,672 --> 01:14:38,800
He's the babysitter, Your Honor,
of sorts. A paid position.

1128
01:14:38,967 --> 01:14:40,176
May I ask why this is relevant?

1129
01:14:40,343 --> 01:14:42,387
Is your client aware
that Mr. MacKenna

1130
01:14:42,553 --> 01:14:45,974
takes her son to the racetrack,
and they gamble?

1131
01:14:46,140 --> 01:14:48,393
He also takes him to a local bar.

1132
01:14:50,561 --> 01:14:52,897
We went to the horses a few times.

1133
01:14:53,064 --> 01:14:54,983
A few times? Was that fun?

1134
01:14:56,317 --> 01:14:57,652
- Well, a little.
- Yeah, good.

1135
01:15:00,905 --> 01:15:04,033
This is completely news to me.
I've never heard this before.

1136
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:06,703
My client is unaware of these events,
as am I,

1137
01:15:06,869 --> 01:15:10,456
which is a big surprise right now.

1138
01:15:10,623 --> 01:15:13,334
I'll bet there are quite a few surprises
in this folder, then.

1139
01:15:13,501 --> 01:15:15,837
- Oh, God.
- Daka Parimova?

1140
01:15:17,130 --> 01:15:19,173
Are you aware of her occupation?

1141
01:15:20,758 --> 01:15:22,510
She works for Vin.

1142
01:15:22,677 --> 01:15:24,637
She works for Vince, right?

1143
01:15:26,889 --> 01:15:30,518
- She's a lady of the night.
- What?

1144
01:15:30,685 --> 01:15:32,478
Do you know what that means?

1145
01:15:33,396 --> 01:15:35,106
She works at night?

1146
01:15:39,819 --> 01:15:43,531
She may be a prostitute.

1147
01:15:45,450 --> 01:15:50,288
Your Honor, I need a few minutes to, uh,
confer with my client.

1148
01:15:50,455 --> 01:15:52,081
I imagine you do.

1149
01:15:55,043 --> 01:15:57,879
I guess gambling and a racetrack
is like a math class, huh?

1150
01:15:58,046 --> 01:16:00,256
- You got to learn how to bet?
- The odds.

1151
01:16:00,423 --> 01:16:03,259
The bar. Guess that could fall
under current events, right?

1152
01:16:03,426 --> 01:16:05,428
More like social studies.

1153
01:16:07,513 --> 01:16:10,892
It's the strip club hooker
that I can't seem to get my head around.

1154
01:16:11,809 --> 01:16:13,186
Commerce?

1155
01:16:13,978 --> 01:16:14,979
Biology?

1156
01:16:15,897 --> 01:16:18,524
Just stop talking. Don't talk.

1157
01:16:23,446 --> 01:16:25,281
Vin!

1158
01:16:25,448 --> 01:16:26,574
Vin!

1159
01:16:28,451 --> 01:16:29,619
Vin!

1160
01:16:32,955 --> 01:16:36,709
Why do you people think
my people can't hear?

1161
01:16:36,876 --> 01:16:40,463
What kind of a man takes a child
to a bar and to the racetrack?

1162
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:43,674
And has him hanging out
with a prostitute?

1163
01:16:43,841 --> 01:16:45,635
What kind of mother

1164
01:16:45,802 --> 01:16:48,054
lets her son hang out

1165
01:16:48,221 --> 01:16:51,307
with a man I-I-I-like that?

1166
01:16:51,474 --> 01:16:53,351
You're an asshole, Vin.

1167
01:16:53,518 --> 01:16:56,854
50-50 custody with his asshole dad,
and I have you to thank for that.

1168
01:16:57,021 --> 01:17:02,318
You have no one
but yourself to blame for that.

1169
01:17:02,485 --> 01:17:04,320
He needs more than...

1170
01:17:06,447 --> 01:17:08,032
a deadbeat mother.

1171
01:17:09,325 --> 01:17:12,495
Good one, and maybe I deserve that.

1172
01:17:12,662 --> 01:17:14,705
I don't know what I was thinking
letting him hang outwith you.

1173
01:17:14,872 --> 01:17:16,916
My sentiments exactly.

1174
01:17:17,083 --> 01:17:19,877
Well, he's not coming over there
anymore. That's a given.

1175
01:17:20,044 --> 01:17:22,755
I'll get you your money
for your stupid tree.

1176
01:17:22,922 --> 01:17:25,007
There'll be some interest.

1177
01:17:25,174 --> 01:17:26,467
Yeah, good luck with that.

1178
01:17:29,095 --> 01:17:31,013
Oh. I'm sorry! Sorry!

1179
01:17:32,598 --> 01:17:35,601
My reaction time is much slower
these days.

1180
01:17:35,768 --> 01:17:37,228
Yeah, you were never fast,
just stupid.

1181
01:17:47,238 --> 01:17:50,241
You have seven new messages.

1182
01:17:52,034 --> 01:17:56,205
Hello, Vin.
This is Ana here at Sunnyside.

1183
01:17:56,372 --> 01:18:00,710
I'm afraid we have some bad
news regarding your wife, Sandy, sir.

1184
01:18:00,877 --> 01:18:03,546
Please call us as soon as you get this.

1185
01:18:07,425 --> 01:18:11,095
Vin, hello, it's Ana again at Sunnyside.

1186
01:18:11,262 --> 01:18:14,098
We haven't heard back from you
regarding Sandy.

1187
01:18:14,265 --> 01:18:16,809
Please call us right away.

1188
01:18:21,647 --> 01:18:25,818
Vincent, uh, we've left a few messages
for you. We haven't heard back.

1189
01:18:25,985 --> 01:18:27,695
We really need to hear from you
about Sandy.

1190
01:18:27,862 --> 01:18:29,780
Please call or come by
as soon as possible.

1191
01:18:43,294 --> 01:18:44,921
Feeling OK?

1192
01:18:45,087 --> 01:18:47,548
- It's a bit chilly.
- Yes, it is.

1193
01:18:59,477 --> 01:19:01,646
OK.

1194
01:19:01,812 --> 01:19:03,356
Here we go, Vin.

1195
01:19:04,732 --> 01:19:07,485
All of Sandy's personal items
are in there.

1196
01:19:09,028 --> 01:19:12,031
My wife, where is she?

1197
01:19:12,198 --> 01:19:14,283
She died, Vin.

1198
01:19:14,450 --> 01:19:16,452
I know that.

1199
01:19:16,619 --> 01:19:18,162
Where is she?

1200
01:19:18,329 --> 01:19:20,206
She's in there.

1201
01:19:23,042 --> 01:19:24,210
Where?

1202
01:19:24,377 --> 01:19:26,295
In the box.

1203
01:19:26,462 --> 01:19:27,880
Her remains, Vin.

1204
01:19:31,133 --> 01:19:32,635
She died a few weeks ago.

1205
01:19:32,802 --> 01:19:34,887
We tried contacting you
several times.

1206
01:19:35,054 --> 01:19:36,764
And when we didn't hear back
from you,

1207
01:19:36,931 --> 01:19:39,475
we decided to go ahead
with your death directives.

1208
01:19:39,642 --> 01:19:40,726
You wanted her cremated.

1209
01:19:42,687 --> 01:19:44,438
She's in that box?

1210
01:19:44,605 --> 01:19:47,858
Her remains are, Vin, yes.

1211
01:19:48,025 --> 01:19:51,362
In a box inside that box.

1212
01:19:53,823 --> 01:19:55,741
I am sorry for your loss, Vin.

1213
01:20:00,580 --> 01:20:04,375
This place is peace.

1214
01:20:06,627 --> 01:20:09,922
It... w-w-w-was.

1215
01:20:18,639 --> 01:20:21,017
Nah, I didn't study. I never study.

1216
01:20:21,183 --> 01:20:22,768
- OK, see you later.
- See you around, man.

1217
01:20:23,311 --> 01:20:24,645
- All right.
- Later, Oliver.

1218
01:20:24,812 --> 01:20:26,606
- Hey, you got a lot of homework?
- Hey.

1219
01:20:26,772 --> 01:20:28,316
Art, some math.

1220
01:20:28,482 --> 01:20:29,567
OK.

1221
01:20:31,527 --> 01:20:32,862
Is she with us?

1222
01:20:33,029 --> 01:20:36,365
Yeah, she's your father's idea
of safer child care.

1223
01:20:36,532 --> 01:20:37,533
What's her name?

1224
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:39,201
You have a voice, you ask her.

1225
01:20:39,368 --> 01:20:40,953
Excuse me, what's your name?

1226
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:42,330
Amelda.

1227
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:43,789
Hi, Amelda.

1228
01:20:43,956 --> 01:20:45,124
Hola, Mr. Oliver.

1229
01:20:45,291 --> 01:20:46,792
Is she every day?

1230
01:20:46,959 --> 01:20:49,712
And every other weekend
when you're gonna go to your dad's.

1231
01:20:49,879 --> 01:20:51,213
That's what it's gonna be now, bub.

1232
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:53,883
You're gonna get shuffled back
and forth between me and him.

1233
01:20:54,050 --> 01:20:57,345
Well, he is my dad.

1234
01:20:57,511 --> 01:21:01,474
I know he cheated on you
a bunch of times, and...

1235
01:21:01,641 --> 01:21:02,975
that's why we left him.

1236
01:21:03,142 --> 01:21:05,269
Really?

1237
01:21:07,188 --> 01:21:08,439
How do you know that?

1238
01:21:08,606 --> 01:21:10,024
You'll tell anybody who'll listen.

1239
01:21:10,191 --> 01:21:12,818
Grandma, Aunt Judy, all the cousins.

1240
01:21:12,985 --> 01:21:15,112
It's also your Facebook status.

1241
01:21:17,698 --> 01:21:20,576
I know. I've been meaning
to change that.

1242
01:21:22,078 --> 01:21:23,704
I should just say I'm single.

1243
01:21:23,871 --> 01:21:25,373
Yeah, that's better.

1244
01:21:34,799 --> 01:21:37,426
Hey, Vin.

1245
01:21:38,678 --> 01:21:40,137
M-My replacement?

1246
01:21:40,304 --> 01:21:41,889
Yeah, I guess so.

1247
01:21:42,056 --> 01:21:47,144
I'd hate to have to report your mother
to Immigration and Natur...

1248
01:21:47,311 --> 01:21:48,729
I am a citizen.

1249
01:21:51,357 --> 01:21:54,193
Mr. Oliver, one minute.

1250
01:21:55,486 --> 01:21:57,363
What's in the box?

1251
01:21:57,530 --> 01:21:59,490
My wife.

1252
01:22:00,658 --> 01:22:02,451
She died?

1253
01:22:02,618 --> 01:22:04,161
No.

1254
01:22:04,328 --> 01:22:05,496
Sh...

1255
01:22:05,663 --> 01:22:07,123
She shrunk herself.

1256
01:22:07,289 --> 01:22:09,125
She's living in there now.

1257
01:22:09,917 --> 01:22:11,335
Rent-free.

1258
01:22:12,837 --> 01:22:15,798
Sorry, Vin, for your loss.

1259
01:22:16,090 --> 01:22:18,926
Never understood...

1260
01:22:19,468 --> 01:22:23,180
wh-wh-why people say that.

1261
01:22:24,473 --> 01:22:26,434
They don't know what else to say.

1262
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:29,854
How about, "What was she like?

1263
01:22:30,020 --> 01:22:34,442
Do you miss her?"
Or "What are you gonna do now?"

1264
01:22:38,612 --> 01:22:40,072
Do yourself a favor.

1265
01:22:40,239 --> 01:22:42,491
Get a life.

1266
01:22:42,658 --> 01:22:45,077
Stop living mine.

1267
01:22:47,246 --> 01:22:49,415
Take my word.

1268
01:22:49,582 --> 01:22:52,251
It's not working for shit for me.

1269
01:22:52,418 --> 01:22:54,462
That's not true.

1270
01:22:54,628 --> 01:22:56,630
What the he...

1271
01:22:58,340 --> 01:23:00,259
hell do you know about me?

1272
01:23:02,511 --> 01:23:04,722
You don't know me.

1273
01:23:05,765 --> 01:23:07,725
You're just stupid.

1274
01:23:10,728 --> 01:23:12,980
Of course I'm stupid.

1275
01:23:14,565 --> 01:23:16,275
Mostly for thinking

1276
01:23:16,442 --> 01:23:20,613
you're more than just
a drunk, mean old man.

1277
01:23:21,822 --> 01:23:24,033
Guess that's goodbye.

1278
01:23:27,953 --> 01:23:30,289
You're a sad...

1279
01:23:30,456 --> 01:23:32,333
sad man.

1280
01:23:45,513 --> 01:23:49,809
I loved you to the moon there, Sandy.

1281
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:53,395
I loved you to the moon.

1282
01:24:53,789 --> 01:24:55,249
All right, two weeks.

1283
01:24:55,416 --> 01:24:57,459
Two weeks to
our Saints Among Us assembly.

1284
01:24:58,878 --> 01:25:03,299
The grand culmination of your sizable
efforts on one great stage.

1285
01:25:03,465 --> 01:25:06,886
Don't forget to invite your parents,
significant others, et cetera.

1286
01:25:07,052 --> 01:25:09,680
Wives, girlfriends,
and enjoy yourselves.

1287
01:25:09,847 --> 01:25:13,017
And no expletives in your presentation,
please, Ocinski.

1288
01:25:13,183 --> 01:25:15,686
He doesn't like Ocinski,
Brother Geraghty, never has.

1289
01:25:16,645 --> 01:25:18,314
The name's Robert, sir.

1290
01:25:32,745 --> 01:25:34,163
He didn't tell you
he was a soldier?

1291
01:25:34,330 --> 01:25:35,581
No, sir.

1292
01:25:35,748 --> 01:25:38,959
A sergeant major, of all things.
He's famous.

1293
01:25:42,463 --> 01:25:43,881
But it's too expensive.

1294
01:25:44,048 --> 01:25:45,883
I don't know how to buy this crib

1295
01:25:46,050 --> 01:25:49,470
that looks nice
and is cheap enough. I...

1296
01:25:49,637 --> 01:25:51,722
Oh, this one? This is good.

1297
01:25:51,889 --> 01:25:53,265
Ma'am, I'm sorry,
this is the wrong price.

1298
01:25:53,432 --> 01:25:54,600
I like this.

1299
01:25:54,767 --> 01:25:56,060
No, no, no, I like this.

1300
01:25:56,226 --> 01:25:58,062
- This is great. I love this.
- I take it.

1301
01:25:58,228 --> 01:25:59,647
- This is fantastic.
- Can we get this?

1302
01:25:59,813 --> 01:26:00,814
We can afford this.

1303
01:26:00,981 --> 01:26:02,399
- Ma'am...
- This is nice.

1304
01:26:02,566 --> 01:26:03,901
I like this. I want this.

1305
01:26:04,068 --> 01:26:05,152
This is great.

1306
01:26:05,319 --> 01:26:06,654
OK, I'll take it.

1307
01:26:14,995 --> 01:26:16,413
That's the old guy?

1308
01:26:16,580 --> 01:26:18,540
Yeah, he was in Vietnam.

1309
01:26:18,707 --> 01:26:19,833
Did I study the states?

1310
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,168
It's a country.

1311
01:26:21,335 --> 01:26:23,629
States are inside countries.

1312
01:26:23,796 --> 01:26:26,674
"Do not place items
with string around child's neck,

1313
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:29,343
such as hoods strings
or pacifier cords.

1314
01:26:29,510 --> 01:26:32,012
Strings can cause strangulation."

1315
01:26:33,222 --> 01:26:34,640
I don't want this crib.

1316
01:26:41,063 --> 01:26:42,064
Hey, Dad.

1317
01:26:43,065 --> 01:26:44,566
- Good day?
- Yeah.

1318
01:26:44,733 --> 01:26:46,193
All right, seat belt, please.

1319
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:49,530
How long has Vin
been doing Sandy's laundry?

1320
01:26:49,697 --> 01:26:53,200
Oh, geez, every week for eight years.

1321
01:26:53,367 --> 01:26:54,743
That's a long time.

1322
01:26:54,910 --> 01:26:56,495
It is a long time.

1323
01:26:56,662 --> 01:26:58,455
He's a good guy, Vin.

1324
01:27:07,715 --> 01:27:09,383
What's Vin like when I'm not around?

1325
01:27:09,550 --> 01:27:11,093
He don't like people.

1326
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:12,928
People don't like him.

1327
01:27:13,095 --> 01:27:15,097
Except cat and you.

1328
01:27:15,264 --> 01:27:16,515
Why you like him?

1329
01:27:24,815 --> 01:27:27,276
That'll be straight.

1330
01:27:31,071 --> 01:27:32,990
Oliver, come on!

1331
01:27:35,325 --> 01:27:37,036
Breakfast is ready!

1332
01:27:37,453 --> 01:27:39,329
Gonna get cold!

1333
01:27:41,373 --> 01:27:42,624
Let's go!

1334
01:27:46,879 --> 01:27:50,174
- Hi, Mom.
- Don't look so surprised. Sit down.

1335
01:27:50,340 --> 01:27:53,635
You need some fuel
for your big day, right? Sit.

1336
01:27:54,386 --> 01:27:56,305
- You made all this?
- Yes, I made it all.

1337
01:27:56,472 --> 01:27:57,514
I know how to cook.

1338
01:27:57,681 --> 01:27:58,766
I took the day off.

1339
01:27:58,932 --> 01:28:02,061
- Thanks.
- Well, you're welcome, bub.

1340
01:28:02,227 --> 01:28:04,146
This giving you trouble?

1341
01:28:04,313 --> 01:28:06,106
Come here, I'll show you the trick.

1342
01:28:06,899 --> 01:28:08,776
You got to pop this up.

1343
01:28:10,778 --> 01:28:12,738
OK.

1344
01:28:12,905 --> 01:28:15,449
Like that, it's like magic.

1345
01:28:16,366 --> 01:28:17,618
I love you, Mom.

1346
01:28:19,161 --> 01:28:20,704
Me, too.

1347
01:28:21,371 --> 01:28:22,456
Sit down.

1348
01:28:22,623 --> 01:28:24,249
OK, coffee or juice?

1349
01:28:25,250 --> 01:28:27,252
- Uh, latte?
- Nice try.

1350
01:28:37,012 --> 01:28:39,973
Oh! My water is broken!

1351
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:41,391
Call a plumber.

1352
01:28:41,558 --> 01:28:43,018
Let's go.

1353
01:28:44,228 --> 01:28:45,312
Get up!

1354
01:28:57,783 --> 01:29:00,160
Hello. Sit down, children, thank you.

1355
01:29:00,327 --> 01:29:03,372
Good morning. Welcome to
our Saints Among Us assembly

1356
01:29:03,539 --> 01:29:05,165
here at St. Patrick.

1357
01:29:05,332 --> 01:29:08,710
And the children have been working very
hard, and it'll be interesting to see

1358
01:29:08,877 --> 01:29:11,213
which parents they have chosen
as saints.

1359
01:29:11,380 --> 01:29:12,756
I'm sure you're all very nervous.

1360
01:29:14,091 --> 01:29:17,803
Our first speaker is Keesha Demorcy.

1361
01:29:24,601 --> 01:29:26,436
For my real-life saint,

1362
01:29:26,603 --> 01:29:29,064
I picked Mother Teresa of Calcutta.

1363
01:29:32,818 --> 01:29:35,779
- OK, OK.
- Stop anywhere! Anywhere!

1364
01:29:39,992 --> 01:29:41,285
When will you become like man?

1365
01:29:46,290 --> 01:29:48,292
Jesus, my manhood!

1366
01:29:48,458 --> 01:29:50,961
Saint Nicholas of Sunnyside, everybody.

1367
01:29:53,964 --> 01:29:57,217
All right, next up we have
Oliver Bronstein.

1368
01:29:57,384 --> 01:29:59,386
Oliver Bronstein.

1369
01:30:05,309 --> 01:30:08,812
Saints are human beings
we celebrate for their commitment

1370
01:30:08,979 --> 01:30:10,939
and dedication to other human beings.

1371
01:30:11,106 --> 01:30:14,568
Brother Geraghty, circa around March.

1372
01:30:21,408 --> 01:30:22,784
This isn't the hospital.

1373
01:30:22,951 --> 01:30:26,580
So now you are rocket surgeon.
Come on, get inside.

1374
01:30:27,372 --> 01:30:28,582
For my modern day saint,

1375
01:30:28,749 --> 01:30:31,084
I chose a man who shares
many of the same qualities

1376
01:30:31,251 --> 01:30:32,961
as Saint William of Rochester.

1377
01:30:33,128 --> 01:30:35,839
On the surface, one might think my saint

1378
01:30:36,006 --> 01:30:38,467
is the least likely candidate
for sainthood.

1379
01:30:38,634 --> 01:30:40,677
He's not a happy person.

1380
01:30:40,844 --> 01:30:44,473
He doesn't like people,
and not many people like him.

1381
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:46,433
He's grumpy, angry',

1382
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:48,936
mad at the world,
and I'm sure full of regrets.

1383
01:30:50,395 --> 01:30:52,064
He drinks too much, smokes.

1384
01:30:52,231 --> 01:30:54,691
He gambles, curses, lies and cheats.

1385
01:30:54,858 --> 01:30:57,819
And he spends a lot of time
with a lady of the night.

1386
01:31:00,239 --> 01:31:04,117
- That's what you see at first glance.
- After you.

1387
01:31:04,284 --> 01:31:06,703
If you dig deeper, you'll see
a man beyond his flaws.

1388
01:31:08,455 --> 01:31:11,541
Mr. Vincent MacKenna was born in 1946

1389
01:31:11,708 --> 01:31:13,252
in Sheepshead Bay,

1390
01:31:13,418 --> 01:31:16,338
the son of first-generation
Irish immigrants.

1391
01:31:19,258 --> 01:31:21,176
Growing up poor
on the streets of Brooklyn,

1392
01:31:21,343 --> 01:31:24,471
Vincent learned all the things
that kids shouldn't need to know:

1393
01:31:24,638 --> 01:31:28,058
fighting, cursing and gambling.

1394
01:31:28,225 --> 01:31:33,063
In 1965, as a member of the
United States Army's Fifth Regiment,

1395
01:31:33,230 --> 01:31:36,108
Vincent was among the 450 soldiers

1396
01:31:36,275 --> 01:31:39,444
dropped into the La Drang Valley
and immediately ambushed

1397
01:31:39,611 --> 01:31:41,238
by 2,000 enemy troops.

1398
01:31:41,405 --> 01:31:45,075
There he heroically saved the lives
of two wounded officers

1399
01:31:45,242 --> 01:31:48,996
pinned down by enemy fire
and carried them to safety.

1400
01:31:49,162 --> 01:31:52,749
He was awarded the Bronze Star
for his bravery.

1401
01:31:52,916 --> 01:31:54,626
I imagine the best way I can tell you

1402
01:31:54,793 --> 01:31:56,461
who Mr. Vincent MacKenna is

1403
01:31:56,628 --> 01:31:59,715
is to tell you what he's done for me.

1404
01:31:59,881 --> 01:32:02,926
When me and my mom first moved here,
we knew no one,

1405
01:32:03,093 --> 01:32:06,680
and Mr. MacKenna took me in
when he didn't have to,

1406
01:32:06,847 --> 01:32:08,515
and most likely didn't want to.

1407
01:32:08,682 --> 01:32:11,393
But he did it anyhow,
'cause that's what saints do.

1408
01:32:13,186 --> 01:32:17,190
We visited his wife, Sandy,
of 40 years, who recently passed away.

1409
01:32:17,357 --> 01:32:20,652
Vin's done her laundry every week
for the past eight years,

1410
01:32:20,819 --> 01:32:22,612
long after she no longer
recognized him.

1411
01:32:22,779 --> 01:32:25,574
Because saints never give up.

1412
01:32:25,741 --> 01:32:27,200
He taught me how to fight,

1413
01:32:27,367 --> 01:32:29,286
how to stand my ground and be brave,

1414
01:32:29,453 --> 01:32:31,413
how to speak up and be bold.

1415
01:32:31,580 --> 01:32:33,999
Because saints fight
for themselves and others,

1416
01:32:34,166 --> 01:32:36,001
so that they might be heard.

1417
01:32:36,168 --> 01:32:38,754
He taught me how to gamble,
horse racing,

1418
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:40,839
Keno, the over and under,

1419
01:32:41,006 --> 01:32:43,967
which is a big reason
why I'm grounded till I'm 18.

1420
01:32:46,136 --> 01:32:48,889
But in that,
I learned how to take risks

1421
01:32:49,056 --> 01:32:50,140
and go for broke.

1422
01:32:50,307 --> 01:32:53,935
Because in life,
the odds can be stacked against you.

1423
01:32:54,102 --> 01:32:55,771
This is Vin's cat, Felix,

1424
01:32:55,937 --> 01:32:58,815
who eats gourmet cat food
while Vin eats sardines.

1425
01:32:58,982 --> 01:33:02,486
'Cause saints make sacrifices.

1426
01:33:02,652 --> 01:33:04,821
Yes, Mr. Vincent MacKenna is flawed,

1427
01:33:04,988 --> 01:33:09,451
seriously flawed, but just like
all the other saints we studied.

1428
01:33:09,618 --> 01:33:12,621
Because after all,
saints are human beings,

1429
01:33:12,788 --> 01:33:14,581
very human beings.

1430
01:33:14,748 --> 01:33:17,501
Courage, sacrifice,
compassion, humanity.

1431
01:33:17,667 --> 01:33:19,669
These are the markings of a saint,

1432
01:33:19,836 --> 01:33:22,839
and what makes Mr. Vincent MacKenna
not so far removed

1433
01:33:23,006 --> 01:33:24,800
from Saint William of Rochester.

1434
01:33:24,966 --> 01:33:28,053
And with that, I'd like to present
my friend and babysitter,

1435
01:33:28,220 --> 01:33:30,806
Mr. Vincent MacKenna, for sainthood,

1436
01:33:30,972 --> 01:33:32,766
and hereby proclaim him

1437
01:33:32,933 --> 01:33:35,894
St. Vincent of Sheepshead Bay.

1438
01:34:21,398 --> 01:34:23,567
Thank you, sir.

1439
01:34:24,693 --> 01:34:25,986
Thank you, kid.

1440
01:34:41,710 --> 01:34:44,421
Saint Vincent of Sheepshead Bay.

1441
01:34:48,133 --> 01:34:49,801
All right, I got it.
I owe you money anyhow.

1442
01:34:49,968 --> 01:34:51,344
- Thanks.
- What are you looking at?

1443
01:34:52,220 --> 01:34:54,764
- Uh, hard pretzels.
- That's just what I was looking at.

1444
01:34:54,931 --> 01:34:57,642
If you do it just right,

1445
01:34:57,809 --> 01:34:59,519
you can end up with...

1446
01:34:59,686 --> 01:35:02,564
two... for the price of one.

1447
01:35:03,565 --> 01:35:04,649
Pretty cool.

1448
01:35:04,816 --> 01:35:06,401
That's pretty good, kiddo.

1449
01:35:06,568 --> 01:35:08,653
I might have to adopt that.

1450
01:35:08,820 --> 01:35:10,947
Mr. MacKenna, it's about that time.

1451
01:35:11,114 --> 01:35:12,616
All right, hold your horses.

1452
01:35:13,742 --> 01:35:15,744
Although, technically, that's stealing.

1453
01:35:24,836 --> 01:35:27,214
Oh, it's OK, it's OK. Don't cry.

1454
01:35:27,380 --> 01:35:29,049
It's OK.

1455
01:35:29,216 --> 01:35:30,258
So what is it?

1456
01:35:30,425 --> 01:35:33,470
Black, white, ugly?

1457
01:35:33,637 --> 01:35:35,013
Get out of here.

1458
01:35:35,180 --> 01:35:37,265
I like this baby.

1459
01:35:39,309 --> 01:35:41,478
Do you like this baby?

1460
01:35:42,771 --> 01:35:44,231
Yeah, so far.

1461
01:35:45,732 --> 01:35:47,108
I'm so happy-

1462
01:35:54,074 --> 01:35:55,492
I'll teach you someday.

1463
01:35:55,659 --> 01:35:56,868
- You'll like it.
- Boys, come on.

1464
01:35:57,035 --> 01:35:59,371
It's not Russian, but...
Oh, sorry, cat.

1465
01:35:59,538 --> 01:36:00,580
OK, you must eat vegetables.

1466
01:36:00,747 --> 01:36:02,707
It's colorful.

1467
01:36:02,874 --> 01:36:03,917
I'll say that.

1468
01:36:04,084 --> 01:36:06,586
- I like the green beans.
- You do?

1469
01:36:06,753 --> 01:36:09,548
Yeah, I don't think you ever get
enough spaghetti and green beans.

1470
01:36:09,714 --> 01:36:11,508
My mom makes them out of a can.

1471
01:36:11,675 --> 01:36:12,968
That's how your brain got stilted.

1472
01:36:13,134 --> 01:36:15,095
Oh, you have stilted brain.

1473
01:36:15,262 --> 01:36:17,514
- That's probably good.
- Like the retard.

1474
01:36:17,681 --> 01:36:19,391
Hey, the "R" word's not cool.

1475
01:36:19,558 --> 01:36:21,226
It's not politically correct.

1476
01:36:21,393 --> 01:36:23,478
- Why is this?
- It's like when you say "midget."

1477
01:36:23,645 --> 01:36:25,105
"Midget"?

1478
01:36:25,272 --> 01:36:26,898
Why not "midget"?

1479
01:36:29,317 --> 01:36:30,360
This food beats hunger.

1480
01:36:31,611 --> 01:36:33,029
By a hair.

1481
01:36:34,573 --> 01:36:36,908
Don't you want to say something?

1482
01:36:37,075 --> 01:36:38,076
Like what?

1483
01:36:38,243 --> 01:36:40,579
Like a blessing or a prayer?

1484
01:36:51,464 --> 01:36:53,133
No, I'd better not.

1485
01:36:58,305 --> 01:37:00,432
Baby is hungry.

1486
01:37:00,599 --> 01:37:03,351
All this delicious food,
and where's yours?

1487
01:37:05,353 --> 01:37:08,481
It's not fair for everyone
to have a big meal except you, huh?

1488
01:37:09,941 --> 01:37:10,942
Oh!

1489
01:37:11,109 --> 01:37:14,446
