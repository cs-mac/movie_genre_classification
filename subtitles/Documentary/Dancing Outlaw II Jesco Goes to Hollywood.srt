1
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:02,510
You must declare all items.

2
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,741
Undeclared items will be confiscated.

3
00:01:04,816 --> 00:01:06,977
Cho, declare the ginseng to customs.

4
00:01:07,051 --> 00:01:10,077
Why, Pop? They make us
pay 50 bucks in duty.

5
00:01:10,154 --> 00:01:12,054
I know.

6
00:01:12,123 --> 00:01:13,522
What if I just hide it in my pants?

7
00:01:13,591 --> 00:01:14,956
They'll never know.

8
00:01:15,026 --> 00:01:16,618
Brilliant, Fei Hong.

9
00:01:16,694 --> 00:01:18,025
Better yet, why don't we
have the master hold onto it?

10
00:01:18,096 --> 00:01:19,028
They'll never search him,

11
00:01:19,097 --> 00:01:20,029
because he's too respectable.

12
00:01:20,098 --> 00:01:21,030
What do you think?

13
00:01:21,099 --> 00:01:22,157
Very good idea.

14
00:01:22,233 --> 00:01:23,427
You're hopeless... both of you.

15
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:24,832
Bad idea.

16
00:01:24,903 --> 00:01:26,894
I'll not hear any more of your nonsense.

17
00:01:26,971 --> 00:01:27,938
I just don't understand

18
00:01:28,006 --> 00:01:28,938
why we have to pay duties...

19
00:01:29,007 --> 00:01:30,269
on everything we buy?

20
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:32,400
I don't care what you
say. Just listen to me.

21
00:01:32,477 --> 00:01:34,308
Avoid trouble. Pay
the duties, that's it.

22
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:35,311
I know best.

23
00:01:41,386 --> 00:01:42,444
Back, back.

24
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,717
Back. Make way. Let
the ambassador through.

25
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,985
What's going on?

26
00:01:48,059 --> 00:01:49,083
Now watch it.

27
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,184
It's the ambassador,

28
00:01:50,261 --> 00:01:51,694
and he deserves respect.

29
00:01:51,763 --> 00:01:53,162
He's treated like royalty.

30
00:01:53,231 --> 00:01:54,596
He doesn't have to pay any duties.

31
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:55,963
How about that one?

32
00:01:56,034 --> 00:01:57,467
He's a lucky one.

33
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,106
No pushing. Don't push.

34
00:02:05,176 --> 00:02:06,643
Everybody back.

35
00:02:06,711 --> 00:02:08,008
Let these people through!

36
00:02:10,715 --> 00:02:13,115
Are you all right?

37
00:02:13,184 --> 00:02:14,742
Let's go.

38
00:02:16,754 --> 00:02:18,585
What happened?

39
00:02:18,656 --> 00:02:19,714
Shut up. Someone push him.

40
00:02:20,858 --> 00:02:22,485
Please, sir, I apologise.

41
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,584
Listen, Fei Hong.

42
00:02:23,661 --> 00:02:25,390
Fei Hong, why did you
give him our ginseng?

43
00:02:25,463 --> 00:02:26,555
So we don't have to pay tax.

44
00:02:26,631 --> 00:02:28,258
Once we get on the train,
I'll look for the box.

45
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:29,766
What a terrific idea.

46
00:02:29,834 --> 00:02:30,766
What's that?

47
00:02:30,835 --> 00:02:31,767
You could throw me down again

48
00:02:31,836 --> 00:02:32,825
and I'll hide some more.

49
00:02:32,904 --> 00:02:33,836
Here I go.

50
00:02:37,742 --> 00:02:38,674
He must've tripped.

51
00:02:38,743 --> 00:02:39,675
Look atyou. You're so clumsy.

52
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,837
Come on, get up.

53
00:02:41,913 --> 00:02:42,937
File in!

54
00:02:47,385 --> 00:02:48,852
What a crowd.

55
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,887
Why don't you go get a seat-

56
00:02:49,954 --> 00:02:51,012
and I'll pay the taxes?

57
00:02:51,089 --> 00:02:52,147
All right, son.

58
00:02:52,223 --> 00:02:53,588
I'll see you on board.

59
00:02:53,658 --> 00:02:55,421
If you have nothing to declare,

60
00:02:55,493 --> 00:02:57,120
begin boarding right now.

61
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:06,930
Here, Fei Hong, take this.

62
00:03:07,005 --> 00:03:07,937
Got it.

63
00:03:10,008 --> 00:03:11,441
Come on.

64
00:03:13,211 --> 00:03:15,372
Fei Hong, great.

65
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:18,749
Easy, easy.

66
00:03:18,816 --> 00:03:19,874
Be careful. You'll crush everything.

67
00:03:19,951 --> 00:03:21,213
That's good.

68
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:22,718
Hold it.

69
00:03:24,122 --> 00:03:25,749
Where are you going? Stop!

70
00:03:25,823 --> 00:03:27,620
Come back! Fei Hong!

71
00:03:29,661 --> 00:03:31,720
Fei Hong, let him go!

72
00:03:33,698 --> 00:03:35,256
Fei Hong, forget about him!

73
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,528
Come back here. Come back.

74
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:40,668
Fei Hong,

75
00:03:40,738 --> 00:03:42,433
now, let me remind you.

76
00:03:42,507 --> 00:03:44,873
A hero lives but a few seconds.

77
00:03:44,942 --> 00:03:46,307
A master holds onto his life.

78
00:03:46,377 --> 00:03:47,640
But he stole your wallet.

79
00:03:47,773 --> 00:03:49,536
And I took it back.

80
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:50,701
That's not the issue.

81
00:03:50,776 --> 00:03:52,403
The point is, the stronger man knows...

82
00:03:52,478 --> 00:03:55,038
It's more important to
forgive than it is to fight.

83
00:03:55,114 --> 00:03:56,046
That's right.

84
00:03:56,115 --> 00:03:57,275
What was I thinking?

85
00:04:19,028 --> 00:04:20,393
Your turn.

86
00:04:20,463 --> 00:04:21,794
How about this?

87
00:04:21,864 --> 00:04:25,231
You know better than that.

88
00:04:25,301 --> 00:04:28,498
But there's no other move.

89
00:04:28,571 --> 00:04:30,835
Try it again.

90
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:35,036
Look at the white crane.

91
00:04:35,111 --> 00:04:37,443
Have you ever seen one like that?

92
00:04:37,513 --> 00:04:40,175
It's still your play.

93
00:04:40,249 --> 00:04:41,477
Come on.

94
00:04:41,551 --> 00:04:44,042
Can we start over?

95
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,280
You still have a chance.

96
00:04:45,355 --> 00:04:46,686
Where? I don't see it.

97
00:04:46,756 --> 00:04:48,815
It's not fair. You always win.

98
00:04:48,891 --> 00:04:50,449
Ready?

99
00:04:51,894 --> 00:04:54,294
Damn it!

100
00:04:58,534 --> 00:05:00,365
Are you okay?

101
00:05:01,371 --> 00:05:03,396
I bet that hurt.

102
00:05:03,473 --> 00:05:04,735
I'm sorry, sir.

103
00:05:04,807 --> 00:05:06,570
- Is this yours?
- I'm afraid so.

104
00:05:06,642 --> 00:05:08,303
Be more careful.

105
00:05:10,813 --> 00:05:12,246
Yes, sir.

106
00:05:12,315 --> 00:05:13,247
Ready?

107
00:05:13,316 --> 00:05:14,578
Ready.

108
00:05:16,252 --> 00:05:18,820
Fei Hong, what's this?

109
00:05:18,953 --> 00:05:20,784
We call it cheating.

110
00:05:39,674 --> 00:05:41,437
You've only got 10 minutes, so hurry up.

111
00:05:51,574 --> 00:05:54,065
Come on, we ain't got all day!

112
00:05:55,644 --> 00:05:57,202
The ginseng... time to find it.

113
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:58,507
Yeah. Good idea.

114
00:05:58,581 --> 00:06:00,173
Father, forget about this.

115
00:06:00,249 --> 00:06:01,876
Let me go find something
you're really going to like.

116
00:06:01,951 --> 00:06:04,579
I don't think I'm ready to eat,

117
00:06:04,653 --> 00:06:05,642
but I thank you.

118
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:07,348
Come on, how about a
nice roasted chicken?

119
00:06:07,423 --> 00:06:08,355
We can find him one.

120
00:06:08,424 --> 00:06:09,584
How about it, huh?

121
00:06:09,658 --> 00:06:11,353
Look, I can see you two
want to look around a bit.

122
00:06:11,427 --> 00:06:12,826
It's okay. I'll be fine here.

123
00:06:12,895 --> 00:06:13,919
Go on.

124
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:19,765
You two stay out of
trouble, you hear me?

125
00:06:19,835 --> 00:06:21,097
You make sure you come right back.

126
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:24,963
Pardon me.

127
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,200
Excuse me.

128
00:06:26,275 --> 00:06:27,708
Pardon me.

129
00:06:30,713 --> 00:06:31,680
Sorry, sorry.

130
00:06:37,086 --> 00:06:38,610
Do you believe the smell of this place?

131
00:06:38,687 --> 00:06:41,121
I think I'm going to be sick.

132
00:06:42,591 --> 00:06:44,525
This way.

133
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,167
The vegetation's much nicer.

134
00:06:53,235 --> 00:06:54,759
Yes, I see.

135
00:06:55,938 --> 00:06:57,166
It's making me hungry.

136
00:06:57,239 --> 00:06:59,104
Maybe we could grab a roll.

137
00:07:02,411 --> 00:07:03,969
What are you doing here?

138
00:07:04,046 --> 00:07:05,172
Nothing.

139
00:07:05,247 --> 00:07:06,305
You think you have reservations?

140
00:07:06,382 --> 00:07:07,781
Yeah, yeah, we do.

141
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:08,782
Go on back.

142
00:07:08,851 --> 00:07:09,783
Check inside.

143
00:07:09,852 --> 00:07:10,819
I've had enough. Go on.

144
00:07:10,886 --> 00:07:13,719
One more time, and you're off the train.

145
00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:14,915
So what do we do now?

146
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:15,922
I got an idea.

147
00:07:28,237 --> 00:07:29,169
Now what?

148
00:07:29,238 --> 00:07:30,466
Just watch me.

149
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:34,835
Go!

150
00:07:36,712 --> 00:07:38,839
Go away!

151
00:07:38,914 --> 00:07:40,609
Look out!

152
00:07:40,683 --> 00:07:41,650
They've gone wild!

153
00:07:46,722 --> 00:07:48,587
Here. Hold this.

154
00:07:48,657 --> 00:07:50,124
Stop him!

155
00:07:52,094 --> 00:07:54,119
Fire! Fire!

156
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,176
Sorry, sir.

157
00:08:08,243 --> 00:08:09,175
Wait.

158
00:08:20,422 --> 00:08:23,357
I'm sure he came this way.

159
00:08:26,228 --> 00:08:28,162
Stop!

160
00:08:35,504 --> 00:08:37,404
You!

161
00:08:37,473 --> 00:08:39,464
Where you going?

162
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:41,031
You.

163
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:43,305
Wait. Why you hit...

164
00:08:47,549 --> 00:08:48,709
I kill you!

165
00:08:52,488 --> 00:08:53,978
There. Traitor.

166
00:08:54,056 --> 00:08:55,489
A what?

167
00:08:58,427 --> 00:08:59,359
Hot tea, sir?

168
00:09:01,463 --> 00:09:03,192
Hot tea for sale.

169
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:05,266
Thank you.

170
00:09:11,407 --> 00:09:13,204
You leave me alone!

171
00:09:58,087 --> 00:10:00,078
Next time, I cut your throat...

172
00:10:01,557 --> 00:10:03,024
Traitor.

173
00:10:06,795 --> 00:10:08,023
You.

174
00:10:09,431 --> 00:10:10,796
Listen!

175
00:10:12,668 --> 00:10:14,636
I'm not a traitor, you hear me?

176
00:10:16,538 --> 00:10:17,835
Then what are we fighting about?

177
00:10:17,906 --> 00:10:19,897
Don't play games. You hit me.

178
00:10:59,081 --> 00:11:00,275
Where'd he go?

179
00:11:22,538 --> 00:11:24,870
Back again? Why don't you give up?

180
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,703
Apologise.

181
00:11:26,775 --> 00:11:28,140
What did you say?

182
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:30,041
How dare you call me a traitor?

183
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,204
Okay. Sorry.

184
00:11:33,282 --> 00:11:34,977
Fine, but I still owe you one.

185
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,449
Here.

186
00:11:36,518 --> 00:11:37,883
Show respect.

187
00:11:37,953 --> 00:11:39,113
Stand still.

188
00:11:39,188 --> 00:11:40,246
Respect to you?

189
00:11:40,322 --> 00:11:43,257
You must be kidding me.

190
00:11:46,929 --> 00:11:48,556
Let's make this fair.

191
00:11:53,802 --> 00:11:55,269
Ready?

192
00:12:12,154 --> 00:12:14,213
Drunken boxing.

193
00:12:15,757 --> 00:12:18,225
That's right. I'm the master.

194
00:12:19,661 --> 00:12:20,821
You think so?

195
00:12:20,896 --> 00:12:21,828
Again.

196
00:12:23,732 --> 00:12:24,664
Come on.

197
00:12:24,733 --> 00:12:26,724
- Let's go.
- You come.

198
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,528
You know-

199
00:12:29,605 --> 00:12:31,800
a kid like you isn't worth my time.

200
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,133
I show you!

201
00:12:34,209 --> 00:12:36,040
Tiger Slash At Bear!

202
00:12:39,348 --> 00:12:40,315
Quail!

203
00:12:46,288 --> 00:12:47,812
What do you call that one?

204
00:12:50,058 --> 00:12:52,458
It's called Turtle Holding Wild Bear.

205
00:12:54,196 --> 00:12:55,857
Catch the Bouquet!

206
00:12:55,931 --> 00:12:57,899
Eagle Catch the Rabbit!

207
00:13:01,737 --> 00:13:03,136
Down the Hatch!

208
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,504
Drunk Plays the Flute?

209
00:13:15,684 --> 00:13:16,742
And this one?

210
00:13:18,987 --> 00:13:20,545
Nursing a Hangover.

211
00:13:20,622 --> 00:13:22,613
Okay.

212
00:13:22,691 --> 00:13:23,817
Stand up.

213
00:13:29,364 --> 00:13:30,695
Your kung fu is pretty good.

214
00:13:30,766 --> 00:13:33,064
Young man, you're not too bad yourself,

215
00:13:33,135 --> 00:13:34,261
but that drunken boxing wasn't...

216
00:13:35,337 --> 00:13:36,964
Impressed?

217
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:39,974
Basically, it's slow,
and you have no power.

218
00:13:40,042 --> 00:13:41,703
It's pathetic.

219
00:13:41,777 --> 00:13:43,711
What?

220
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:46,577
I can defeat any kung
fu. I show you power.

221
00:13:46,648 --> 00:13:48,809
That's nice, but you're out of time.

222
00:13:48,884 --> 00:13:50,249
Time? I'm young and strong.

223
00:13:50,319 --> 00:13:51,251
I've got lots of time.

224
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,811
But your train's leaving over there.

225
00:13:53,889 --> 00:13:56,449
Nice try, old man, but
now you're going to get it.

226
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,186
All right, kid.

227
00:13:59,261 --> 00:14:00,353
Come back here!

228
00:14:00,429 --> 00:14:01,599
No, the train!

229
00:14:05,837 --> 00:14:07,805
Wait for me!

230
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,641
Come on, give me your hand.

231
00:14:20,018 --> 00:14:21,542
Thanks a lot.

232
00:14:21,619 --> 00:14:23,553
Get what you were after?

233
00:14:25,623 --> 00:14:27,113
Good fortune to you!

234
00:14:27,191 --> 00:14:28,658
The ginseng.

235
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,826
Ginseng?

236
00:14:41,973 --> 00:14:44,806
All right, everyone here get up.

237
00:14:44,876 --> 00:14:47,310
Gather your luggage for inspection.

238
00:14:47,378 --> 00:14:49,846
Everyone, now. Come on.

239
00:14:51,816 --> 00:14:53,044
You.

240
00:14:53,117 --> 00:14:54,641
Wake up.

241
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,981
Good morning.

242
00:14:56,054 --> 00:14:57,112
What are you doing?

243
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:59,588
Something has been stolen,

244
00:14:59,657 --> 00:15:00,919
and we're going to find it.

245
00:15:00,992 --> 00:15:02,687
Guard, -

246
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,692
search them.

247
00:15:03,761 --> 00:15:05,319
All right, what is all that?

248
00:15:06,497 --> 00:15:08,431
You, take it out.

249
00:15:08,499 --> 00:15:09,431
Hurry up.

250
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,128
Cho, open this. Fei Hong.

251
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:13,170
Let me see.

252
00:15:13,237 --> 00:15:14,602
Bear claw.

253
00:15:14,672 --> 00:15:16,367
What else? Come on.

254
00:15:16,441 --> 00:15:17,533
Green toad.

255
00:15:17,608 --> 00:15:18,939
Next.

256
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:19,999
Deer horn, ginseng...

257
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:23,605
What's that? The one you dropped.

258
00:15:23,681 --> 00:15:24,739
Open that.

259
00:15:24,816 --> 00:15:26,078
This one?

260
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,447
What's that?

261
00:15:27,518 --> 00:15:28,849
Dried yak.

262
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,285
Okay, next.

263
00:15:30,354 --> 00:15:31,514
Now the other box. Come on.

264
00:15:31,589 --> 00:15:32,521
Let me see the other box.

265
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,182
Acorn.

266
00:15:34,258 --> 00:15:36,249
Not that... that.

267
00:15:36,327 --> 00:15:38,693
Let me see that one.

268
00:15:38,763 --> 00:15:40,822
Not that one. The one over there.

269
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:41,956
Which one?

270
00:15:42,033 --> 00:15:43,330
On the seat... between you.

271
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:44,732
This? No. That one.

272
00:15:44,802 --> 00:15:46,269
He means the ginseng.

273
00:15:46,337 --> 00:15:47,565
He wasn't hiding it.

274
00:15:47,638 --> 00:15:49,299
Well, then open it up.

275
00:15:49,373 --> 00:15:51,136
What are you waiting for?

276
00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:52,141
Open that box!

277
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,142
Right now!

278
00:15:53,211 --> 00:15:54,371
Excuse me, sir...

279
00:15:54,445 --> 00:15:57,039
these gentlemen are clearly
physicians from Hunan.

280
00:15:57,115 --> 00:15:59,015
Why don't you give them a break?

281
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,051
I don't give breaks. I give orders.

282
00:16:01,119 --> 00:16:02,677
Show me your papers.

283
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,244
Come on, let's see them.

284
00:16:04,322 --> 00:16:05,254
Here.

285
00:16:07,825 --> 00:16:09,986
Sir, my apologies.

286
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,197
He's with Counterintelligence.

287
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,532
He's with the central government.

288
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:22,402
Better not challenge his authority.

289
00:16:22,473 --> 00:16:23,599
All right, next car.

290
00:16:23,674 --> 00:16:25,301
- Search up there.
- Next car.

291
00:16:27,411 --> 00:16:28,901
I'm amazed they would think

292
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,242
we would steal anything.

293
00:16:30,314 --> 00:16:31,975
It is such an insult.

294
00:16:32,049 --> 00:16:32,981
Yeah.

295
00:16:34,352 --> 00:16:36,650
Put that away.

296
00:16:40,758 --> 00:16:43,784
Do you all realise what this means?

297
00:16:43,861 --> 00:16:45,829
They certainly won't buy
the rest of the shipment-

298
00:16:45,897 --> 00:16:47,364
without it.

299
00:16:49,066 --> 00:16:50,795
You know, I'm truly astounded

300
00:16:50,868 --> 00:16:53,632
at the incompetence of all of you.

301
00:16:53,704 --> 00:16:55,672
You severely damaged my reputation

302
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,731
with the British Museum of Art.

303
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:58,901
They've asked me to deliver

304
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,001
the jade seal of the emperor,

305
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:02,943
and I have every intention

306
00:17:03,014 --> 00:17:04,948
of fulfilling that request.

307
00:17:06,517 --> 00:17:09,611
I don't care how you do it.

308
00:17:09,687 --> 00:17:11,154
I want it back.

309
00:17:11,222 --> 00:17:12,280
Yes, sir.

310
00:17:12,356 --> 00:17:14,051
We think we know who the thief is, sir.

311
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,217
Get him.

312
00:17:15,293 --> 00:17:16,225
Yes, sir.

313
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,296
John-

314
00:17:19,363 --> 00:17:20,421
we're having a bit of trouble

315
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:22,659
with the workers at the steel factory.

316
00:17:22,733 --> 00:17:24,200
I trust you'll deal with it.

317
00:17:24,268 --> 00:17:25,257
Of course, sir.

318
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:27,133
I know just what to
do in this situation.

319
00:17:27,205 --> 00:17:29,070
I promise you'll have no more trouble.

320
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,129
Let's make sure.

321
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,072
Yes, sir.

322
00:17:40,985 --> 00:17:42,452
Ancestors be blessed.

323
00:17:51,896 --> 00:17:53,022
It's grand slam.

324
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,695
Let's go, let's go. Come
on, come on, pay up, pay up.

325
00:17:58,769 --> 00:18:00,600
Quickly. We haven't got all day.

326
00:18:00,671 --> 00:18:02,161
Go and see who is at the door.

327
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,605
Come on.

328
00:18:03,674 --> 00:18:05,642
Money. That's the way.

329
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,642
More. Now your turn.

330
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:08,110
Come on.

331
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:11,079
She wins every turn.

332
00:18:11,148 --> 00:18:12,672
Madam?

333
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,842
The master is back.

334
00:18:13,918 --> 00:18:16,318
Yeah, yeah, the master.

335
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:18,150
It's my husband!

336
00:18:21,292 --> 00:18:22,452
Hello.

337
00:18:22,526 --> 00:18:23,993
What took you so long?

338
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,529
I was in the kitchen.

339
00:18:28,199 --> 00:18:29,666
Stand back.

340
00:18:31,369 --> 00:18:32,301
Here.

341
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,638
Miss me?

342
00:18:36,707 --> 00:18:39,039
What are you all doing?

343
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:41,408
It's you. I'm so glad you're home.

344
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:42,503
How was your trip?

345
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,172
Is everything all right?

346
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,340
All right?

347
00:18:50,488 --> 00:18:51,420
More mah-jongg?

348
00:18:51,489 --> 00:18:53,480
Quiet!

349
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:55,557
How many times have I asked you

350
00:18:55,626 --> 00:18:57,321
not to see patients while I'm away?

351
00:18:57,395 --> 00:18:58,362
You know it's illegal.

352
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:01,262
I know I'm not supposed to,

353
00:19:01,332 --> 00:19:03,562
and I tried to wait, but I had no idea

354
00:19:03,634 --> 00:19:06,535
when you would return.
Besides, if you were me,

355
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,299
I know you would've done the same thing.

356
00:19:09,807 --> 00:19:11,604
I bet you won a lot.

357
00:19:11,676 --> 00:19:13,075
Not now.

358
00:19:14,412 --> 00:19:15,538
Perhaps I should examine them.

359
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:18,207
It's a female problem.

360
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,715
I can handle it.

361
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,877
Fei Hong, would you
prepare my altar for me?

362
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:23,215
All right.

363
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,584
You should wash your hands.

364
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,116
Stop it.

365
00:19:27,191 --> 00:19:30,319
We'll need the altar
ladder over here, please.

366
00:19:30,394 --> 00:19:31,418
Did you remember to water the plants?

367
00:19:31,495 --> 00:19:32,928
- Yes.
- Excellent.

368
00:19:34,832 --> 00:19:36,265
Thank you.

369
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:46,301
Whose money?

370
00:19:54,618 --> 00:19:55,550
What was that?

371
00:19:55,619 --> 00:19:57,450
I didn't hear anything.

372
00:19:57,521 --> 00:19:59,648
The altar.

373
00:20:00,925 --> 00:20:02,586
Thanks for coming.

374
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,560
My share. Gimme.

375
00:20:05,963 --> 00:20:06,895
Go.

376
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,738
Show a little respect.

377
00:20:19,577 --> 00:20:20,976
Now, remember your treatment

378
00:20:21,045 --> 00:20:22,478
next Friday, ladies.

379
00:20:22,546 --> 00:20:25,071
Bring money.

380
00:20:25,149 --> 00:20:26,582
Hello, Mrs. Wong.

381
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:28,379
How are you? Has Master Wong returned?

382
00:20:28,452 --> 00:20:29,714
Yes. He's inside.

383
00:20:29,787 --> 00:20:31,687
Any news about my ginseng?

384
00:20:31,756 --> 00:20:32,688
Did he get it?

385
00:20:32,757 --> 00:20:33,951
Let's ask him. Come in.

386
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:34,957
Thank you.

387
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:36,459
Mr. Chan has come for his ginseng.

388
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:39,690
Why are you here so soon?

389
00:20:39,764 --> 00:20:40,788
Fei Hong.

390
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:42,230
- The ginseng's in the back.
- I know.

391
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:43,664
- Let me get it.
- Go on.

392
00:20:43,734 --> 00:20:45,895
It's beautiful. I
brought you a whole root.

393
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:46,959
Wait till you see it.

394
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:48,335
It's just in back. Some tea?

395
00:20:48,406 --> 00:20:49,600
You are so kind.

396
00:20:49,673 --> 00:20:51,470
Yes. Please have a
seat. I'll be right back.

397
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:52,668
Thank you.

398
00:20:52,743 --> 00:20:53,937
I'm getting out of here.

399
00:20:54,011 --> 00:20:55,410
Where are you going?
You got to help me out.

400
00:20:55,479 --> 00:20:57,470
When the master finds
out, he'll kill me.

401
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:58,480
He will not.

402
00:20:58,549 --> 00:20:59,675
Fei Hong.

403
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,842
What are you doing?

404
00:21:00,918 --> 00:21:02,010
Stepma, come here.

405
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:04,653
I don't know what to do.

406
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:05,882
We're in such trouble.

407
00:21:05,956 --> 00:21:07,253
I lost the ginseng on the train.

408
00:21:07,324 --> 00:21:09,986
What? What did you do now?

409
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:11,028
What'd she say?

410
00:21:12,496 --> 00:21:13,793
Please. You got to help us out.

411
00:21:13,864 --> 00:21:15,092
Fei Hong!

412
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,098
Yes, Dad!

413
00:21:16,167 --> 00:21:17,691
You just go out and serve him tea.

414
00:21:17,768 --> 00:21:19,167
I'll think of something.

415
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,033
I'll leave it up to you two. Coming!

416
00:21:21,105 --> 00:21:23,073
Madam, what should we do about this?

417
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,108
You see that door behind me?

418
00:21:25,176 --> 00:21:26,108
You mean...

419
00:21:26,177 --> 00:21:27,667
- In the cabinet.
- Sure.

420
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:28,871
- There's a black box.
- Yeah?

421
00:21:28,946 --> 00:21:29,913
Look inside it.

422
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,345
Another ginseng. I can't believe it!

423
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,814
Strychnine.

424
00:21:32,883 --> 00:21:34,077
- What for?
- For you.

425
00:21:34,151 --> 00:21:36,085
No, madam, please
don't tease me this way!

426
00:21:36,153 --> 00:21:37,085
Who's teasing?

427
00:21:41,859 --> 00:21:43,224
I have your tea, Mr. Chan.

428
00:21:43,294 --> 00:21:44,761
Thank you very much, son.

429
00:21:44,829 --> 00:21:45,761
Enjoy it.

430
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,236
Go, go.

431
00:21:57,308 --> 00:21:59,367
Father, you must be very hot.

432
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:00,933
Let me help you.

433
00:22:04,648 --> 00:22:06,138
It's real.

434
00:22:06,217 --> 00:22:08,048
Now, Mr. Chan, I know
you have never seen

435
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:10,417
a specimen as beautiful
as this, have you?

436
00:22:10,488 --> 00:22:12,251
And let me tell
you... wait till you see

437
00:22:12,323 --> 00:22:13,585
what happens to you when you take it.

438
00:22:13,657 --> 00:22:14,954
Why, women won't believe the difference

439
00:22:15,025 --> 00:22:16,458
in your performance, and you will owe it

440
00:22:16,527 --> 00:22:18,461
all to the master.

441
00:22:18,529 --> 00:22:20,622
What are you doing with that rutabaga?

442
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:24,357
Rutabaga?

443
00:22:24,435 --> 00:22:26,335
This is a rutabaga?

444
00:22:26,403 --> 00:22:27,556
You mean it isn't ginseng?

445
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:29,658
Silly of me.

446
00:22:29,725 --> 00:22:31,750
Of course it isn't ginseng.
What I meant to tell you

447
00:22:31,827 --> 00:22:34,261
was that you should
stay away from rutabagas-

448
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,922
especially big rutabagas like this one-

449
00:22:35,998 --> 00:22:37,329
while you're taking ginseng.

450
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:39,390
It causes gas and neutralises the effect

451
00:22:39,468 --> 00:22:41,129
or something like that.

452
00:22:41,203 --> 00:22:43,637
Excuse me.

453
00:22:43,706 --> 00:22:44,934
Mr. Chan...

454
00:22:45,007 --> 00:22:48,272
I'm glad she remembered
to tell you about that.

455
00:22:48,344 --> 00:22:49,436
You know, most people don't realise

456
00:22:49,511 --> 00:22:50,842
that when you use ginseng

457
00:22:50,913 --> 00:22:52,540
you should avoid the use of rutabaga,

458
00:22:52,615 --> 00:22:54,207
because they're not a good mix.

459
00:22:54,283 --> 00:22:56,547
Rutabaga, shmutabaga.

460
00:22:56,619 --> 00:22:59,554
Stop that, Fei Hong!

461
00:22:59,622 --> 00:23:01,613
Back so soon?

462
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,351
Now what?

463
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:04,722
Good luck, now.

464
00:23:04,793 --> 00:23:05,953
You think this looks like ginseng?

465
00:23:06,028 --> 00:23:08,326
Yeah, it looks just like it.

466
00:23:08,397 --> 00:23:09,329
Where did you find it?

467
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,967
Father's bonsai tree.

468
00:23:12,034 --> 00:23:14,434
What a great idea. Just blame it on Cho.

469
00:23:19,141 --> 00:23:22,304
I'll try to keep your father distracted.

470
00:23:23,379 --> 00:23:25,540
What do you think of this?

471
00:23:25,614 --> 00:23:26,945
Boy, that looks great.

472
00:23:27,016 --> 00:23:27,948
Great. I'm a genius.

473
00:23:28,017 --> 00:23:30,144
Excuse me. May I have a word?

474
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,981
Just a second.

475
00:23:33,055 --> 00:23:34,716
Of course. I can wait.

476
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,189
What is it, dear?

477
00:23:36,258 --> 00:23:37,589
- Come.
- What?

478
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,321
Come on. Just one minute.

479
00:23:39,395 --> 00:23:41,226
Can't this wait? I'm busy right now.

480
00:23:41,296 --> 00:23:42,228
I'm sorry. I couldn't wait

481
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:43,423
any longer to tell you.

482
00:23:43,499 --> 00:23:45,933
Fei Hong is all grown up now.

483
00:23:46,001 --> 00:23:47,525
Someday, he will leave our house.

484
00:23:47,603 --> 00:23:49,400
- What?
- You know.

485
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:51,496
How cute he was when he was little.

486
00:23:51,573 --> 00:23:53,097
But why is it wet?

487
00:23:53,175 --> 00:23:55,166
Let me tell you. I'm glad you asked.

488
00:23:55,244 --> 00:23:57,178
Because it was just picked this morning.

489
00:23:57,246 --> 00:23:58,679
You're really going to enjoy the potency

490
00:23:58,747 --> 00:23:59,679
of this one.

491
00:23:59,748 --> 00:24:00,612
It's really powerful.

492
00:24:00,683 --> 00:24:01,809
You just need a little bit.

493
00:24:01,884 --> 00:24:03,909
A little brother around
here could take his place.

494
00:24:03,986 --> 00:24:05,180
We can talk about this later.

495
00:24:05,254 --> 00:24:06,243
Don't be rude.

496
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:08,346
Please, or I will never forgive you.

497
00:24:08,424 --> 00:24:10,255
You shouldn't talk that way to me.

498
00:24:10,325 --> 00:24:11,883
Well, you never let me talk.

499
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,257
Honey, not now. Mr. Chan...

500
00:24:13,328 --> 00:24:14,260
Don't you turn your back on me.

501
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:16,024
Okay. Roll it up tight

502
00:24:16,098 --> 00:24:17,190
to keep it nice and fresh

503
00:24:17,266 --> 00:24:18,699
and keep it close to your heart...

504
00:24:18,767 --> 00:24:19,825
Like that.

505
00:24:19,902 --> 00:24:20,960
Remember what I told
you and have a nice day.

506
00:24:21,036 --> 00:24:21,968
Right.

507
00:24:22,037 --> 00:24:23,129
Yes. I really do think

508
00:24:23,205 --> 00:24:24,137
we need to talk about this now.

509
00:24:24,206 --> 00:24:26,140
Master Wong? Thanks for the ginseng.

510
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:28,039
Everything is all right?

511
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,577
Just fine.

512
00:24:29,645 --> 00:24:30,771
- I'll keep it inside.
- He liked it.

513
00:24:30,846 --> 00:24:32,108
Let me see you out.

514
00:24:32,181 --> 00:24:33,273
Let Fei Hong do it.

515
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:35,908
I can show you. Please, this way.

516
00:24:35,984 --> 00:24:37,645
- Bye-bye, now.
- Goodbye, Mr. Chan.

517
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,187
Anyway, as I was saying

518
00:24:39,254 --> 00:24:40,346
before Mr. Chan interrupted us,

519
00:24:40,422 --> 00:24:41,821
it's time you thought about this.

520
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:43,824
I don't know what
you're trying to tell me.

521
00:24:43,892 --> 00:24:45,359
Mother, Mr. Chan's gone.

522
00:24:45,427 --> 00:24:46,359
Thank God.

523
00:24:46,428 --> 00:24:47,725
What's this all about?

524
00:24:47,796 --> 00:24:49,127
Look, if you don't
want to talk about this

525
00:24:49,198 --> 00:24:50,688
right now, I understand.

526
00:24:50,766 --> 00:24:51,790
You've had a really long trip,

527
00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:52,799
and you should get some rest.

528
00:24:52,868 --> 00:24:53,926
Come on. Let's sit down.

529
00:24:54,002 --> 00:24:55,299
Yes, Father. Please take a rest.

530
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:56,962
It's a good idea.

531
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,166
I better start taking
better care of myself.

532
00:24:59,241 --> 00:25:01,801
I need to realise I'm
not getting any younger.

533
00:25:01,877 --> 00:25:04,311
Well? Why do you make that look?

534
00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:06,006
Because I'm afraid he'll find the tree.

535
00:25:06,081 --> 00:25:09,016
Don't be silly. Throw the pot away.

536
00:25:09,084 --> 00:25:10,108
That's not all.

537
00:25:10,185 --> 00:25:11,174
What?

538
00:25:11,253 --> 00:25:13,084
What happens when Mr.
Chan drinks the tea

539
00:25:13,155 --> 00:25:14,213
made from those roots?

540
00:25:14,289 --> 00:25:16,757
So he will get a little dizzy.

541
00:25:16,825 --> 00:25:18,986
He's going to have the time of his life.

542
00:25:19,061 --> 00:25:20,961
I wish I could say the same.

543
00:25:25,033 --> 00:25:27,331
All right. That's it for me.

544
00:25:27,402 --> 00:25:28,630
See you tomorrow.

545
00:25:28,704 --> 00:25:31,104
Thanks for bringing it down.

546
00:25:31,173 --> 00:25:32,868
Ho Sang, she's cooling down.

547
00:25:32,941 --> 00:25:33,873
Can you give me some more fire?

548
00:25:33,942 --> 00:25:35,933
Just give me one minute.

549
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:43,851
Stand back.

550
00:25:47,756 --> 00:25:49,917
That was great. Thanks for the light.

551
00:25:49,992 --> 00:25:51,584
Almost quitting time.

552
00:25:54,463 --> 00:25:56,590
After this, I ought to.

553
00:26:00,035 --> 00:26:01,002
That's it!

554
00:26:05,507 --> 00:26:07,634
See you tomorrow.

555
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:13,141
Get them back to work.

556
00:26:13,215 --> 00:26:14,375
But why?

557
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:15,677
Go!

558
00:26:15,751 --> 00:26:18,276
I'm the new foreman
here. Now ring the bell.

559
00:26:18,353 --> 00:26:19,820
Go on.

560
00:26:19,888 --> 00:26:21,480
Yes, sir.

561
00:26:27,763 --> 00:26:29,230
Hey, Ho Sang,

562
00:26:29,298 --> 00:26:31,198
what the hell you doing now?

563
00:26:31,266 --> 00:26:32,893
Yeah, what are you, out of your mind?

564
00:26:32,968 --> 00:26:34,401
Sorry.

565
00:26:36,772 --> 00:26:38,637
I was just told that we
have a new foreman here.

566
00:26:39,708 --> 00:26:41,300
New foreman?

567
00:26:43,846 --> 00:26:45,973
We seem to have fallen
behind this month,

568
00:26:46,048 --> 00:26:48,915
so everybody works the night shift

569
00:26:48,984 --> 00:26:50,246
for one month.

570
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:52,184
What? Extra shifts?

571
00:26:54,723 --> 00:26:56,554
Hold on.

572
00:26:56,625 --> 00:26:58,252
So, let's say we work

573
00:26:58,327 --> 00:27:00,261
all those overtime hours for you-

574
00:27:00,329 --> 00:27:01,626
then we need overtime pay.

575
00:27:03,198 --> 00:27:04,756
Quiet.

576
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:06,391
You give us no choice.

577
00:27:06,468 --> 00:27:08,026
You either work the overtime,

578
00:27:08,103 --> 00:27:09,570
or we close the steel mill down,

579
00:27:09,638 --> 00:27:11,469
and you'll all be without jobs.

580
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,701
Now, you can take it or leave it.

581
00:27:13,775 --> 00:27:16,710
Mr. Smith, you can't
blackmail us anymore.

582
00:27:16,778 --> 00:27:17,904
We worked hard for you,

583
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,470
and now we've had enough!

584
00:27:19,548 --> 00:27:20,572
We quit!

585
00:27:23,352 --> 00:27:24,979
Hold it!

586
00:27:25,053 --> 00:27:27,078
Nobody is to leave.

587
00:27:27,155 --> 00:27:29,089
You'll stay and work.

588
00:27:29,157 --> 00:27:30,146
Do you understand that?

589
00:27:30,225 --> 00:27:32,056
You can take my job,

590
00:27:32,127 --> 00:27:33,389
but you can't run my life!

591
00:27:33,462 --> 00:27:34,690
You think you can make us?

592
00:27:34,763 --> 00:27:36,458
Who you think you are? Let's go!

593
00:27:40,636 --> 00:27:41,625
Don't move!

594
00:27:41,703 --> 00:27:43,102
You're in our way!

595
00:27:45,574 --> 00:27:48,543
All of you, right now! Get back to work!

596
00:27:51,346 --> 00:27:52,278
Strike breaker!

597
00:27:52,347 --> 00:27:53,974
That's enough!

598
00:27:57,619 --> 00:27:59,052
Free him!

599
00:28:00,489 --> 00:28:01,820
Get him!

600
00:28:09,131 --> 00:28:11,395
Everyone up! Back to work!

601
00:28:11,466 --> 00:28:13,798
Great!

602
00:28:13,869 --> 00:28:15,996
You see? He's very persuasive.

603
00:28:16,071 --> 00:28:17,561
They're going to get right back to work.

604
00:28:20,642 --> 00:28:22,109
No, again.

605
00:28:34,523 --> 00:28:36,457
Black Tiger Slash!

606
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,426
Okay, now! Clean!

607
00:28:43,198 --> 00:28:46,167
It's bloody impossible to
sleep with all this noise.

608
00:28:46,234 --> 00:28:48,464
Why don't we just buy
it and have it bulldozed?

609
00:28:48,537 --> 00:28:50,027
You know that we've
been through this before.

610
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:51,572
Mr. Wong refuses to sell.

611
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,698
It's ruining my life,

612
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:54,605
so why don't you go and
do something about it?

613
00:28:54,676 --> 00:28:55,734
Yes, sir.

614
00:29:11,526 --> 00:29:13,153
I'll catch you later!

615
00:29:13,228 --> 00:29:15,560
Fun, you're working too hard.

616
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,996
You need husband to run
that snake stand, huh?

617
00:29:18,066 --> 00:29:19,465
Perfect job for me, huh?

618
00:29:20,869 --> 00:29:22,063
A husband?

619
00:29:22,137 --> 00:29:23,764
Yeah. I bet you'd be running away

620
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:25,431
from these snakes all day.

621
00:29:25,507 --> 00:29:26,633
Come on, now.

622
00:29:26,708 --> 00:29:28,573
Why would I want to pay some lazy man

623
00:29:28,643 --> 00:29:30,008
when I can do it better, huh?

624
00:29:30,078 --> 00:29:32,706
You know, you make good point.

625
00:29:32,781 --> 00:29:34,442
But seriously now, Fun,

626
00:29:34,516 --> 00:29:35,744
you know, you don't have man around,

627
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:38,342
so I worry about your safety.

628
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,752
I've been thinking...

629
00:29:40,822 --> 00:29:41,754
Let me teach you kung fu.

630
00:29:41,823 --> 00:29:43,757
How about drunken boxing?

631
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:46,157
Where did you get that idea?

632
00:29:46,228 --> 00:29:47,752
No one does that.

633
00:29:47,829 --> 00:29:48,989
If you really want to fight,

634
00:29:49,064 --> 00:29:51,191
I teach you the Choy Li Fu boxing style.

635
00:29:51,266 --> 00:29:53,029
Wise man speak.

636
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,196
What you looking at?

637
00:29:56,271 --> 00:29:58,239
Get back to work.

638
00:30:00,042 --> 00:30:01,304
We've got customers waiting.

639
00:30:01,376 --> 00:30:02,536
They need the help now.

640
00:30:02,611 --> 00:30:03,737
Yellowtail!

641
00:30:03,812 --> 00:30:05,439
Yellowtail? okay.

642
00:30:05,514 --> 00:30:06,769
Drunken boxing.

643
00:30:06,903 --> 00:30:08,495
What does she know anyway?

644
00:30:08,571 --> 00:30:09,731
Chang Tsan.

645
00:30:11,174 --> 00:30:12,106
What, Fei Hong?

646
00:30:12,175 --> 00:30:13,540
A fillet of salmon

647
00:30:13,609 --> 00:30:17,101
and a pound of fish marrow, okay?

648
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,807
Where are you going?

649
00:30:20,383 --> 00:30:21,350
Really soft skin,

650
00:30:21,417 --> 00:30:22,475
but the meat is tougher.

651
00:30:22,552 --> 00:30:25,146
Fun, I'm going to
need a few things, okay?

652
00:30:26,989 --> 00:30:27,921
It's getting away.

653
00:30:29,325 --> 00:30:31,452
One pheasant and two orders of har gow.

654
00:30:31,527 --> 00:30:33,085
That would've been my choice.

655
00:30:33,162 --> 00:30:35,187
I've been waiting for a long time.

656
00:30:36,265 --> 00:30:37,698
- Here.
- Thank you.

657
00:30:37,767 --> 00:30:39,166
You want this or not?

658
00:30:39,235 --> 00:30:40,896
I got a customer waiting.

659
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:42,062
Yeah. I'll be right there.

660
00:30:42,138 --> 00:30:43,298
Fei Hong.

661
00:30:43,372 --> 00:30:45,602
I hear drunken boxing is the best.

662
00:30:45,675 --> 00:30:46,972
Would you be able to teach me?

663
00:30:47,043 --> 00:30:48,101
How about it?

664
00:30:48,177 --> 00:30:49,701
Of course. Anytime.

665
00:30:51,047 --> 00:30:52,776
How about I bone it for you?

666
00:30:52,849 --> 00:30:54,146
No. That's all right.

667
00:30:54,217 --> 00:30:55,377
How about later with that?

668
00:30:55,451 --> 00:30:58,943
We're discussing drunken boxing.

669
00:30:59,021 --> 00:31:01,489
Fei Hong, when do you
think you could teach me?

670
00:31:01,557 --> 00:31:03,582
Anytime would be fine.
You just let me know.

671
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:05,058
Fun, you need real instructor

672
00:31:05,127 --> 00:31:06,560
to learn how to fight.

673
00:31:06,629 --> 00:31:10,121
Maybe Chang Tsan can give you a lesson.

674
00:31:10,199 --> 00:31:11,791
He doesn't teach the style I like.

675
00:31:11,868 --> 00:31:13,096
It's for fighting.

676
00:31:13,169 --> 00:31:14,830
Drunken master just for show.

677
00:31:14,904 --> 00:31:16,531
You cannot win fight that way.

678
00:31:16,606 --> 00:31:18,767
Forget him. He's jealous.

679
00:31:18,841 --> 00:31:19,830
I like your style.

680
00:31:19,909 --> 00:31:22,070
Fei Hong, time to admit it.

681
00:31:22,144 --> 00:31:25,307
Your drunken boxing is
no match for Choy Li Fu.

682
00:31:25,381 --> 00:31:27,406
Isn't that right? You agree?

683
00:31:27,483 --> 00:31:29,041
Yeah! Right! That's right.

684
00:31:29,118 --> 00:31:30,551
Master much better.

685
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,609
He knows.

686
00:31:31,687 --> 00:31:33,120
Depends on who's fighting.

687
00:31:33,189 --> 00:31:34,588
What do you say to a challenge, then?

688
00:31:34,657 --> 00:31:36,591
Out of my way.

689
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:38,786
My Choy Li Fu, your drunken boxing.

690
00:31:38,861 --> 00:31:40,488
And if I lose, you can have your fish

691
00:31:40,563 --> 00:31:43,259
and anything else you
want no charge, on me.

692
00:31:43,332 --> 00:31:44,959
Listen-

693
00:31:45,034 --> 00:31:46,501
you can learn from Fei Hong.

694
00:31:46,569 --> 00:31:48,628
I don't need your help.

695
00:31:50,773 --> 00:31:52,707
I appreciate the offer,

696
00:31:52,775 --> 00:31:54,037
but there's too many people here,

697
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,236
and somebody could get hurt.

698
00:31:55,311 --> 00:31:57,472
No way, Fei Hong. You're
going to fight this time.

699
00:31:57,546 --> 00:31:59,377
Attention, everybody!

700
00:31:59,448 --> 00:32:01,211
Listen!

701
00:32:01,284 --> 00:32:03,479
I'm Chang Tsan, and
this is Wong Fei Hong.

702
00:32:03,552 --> 00:32:04,678
It's your lucky day.

703
00:32:04,754 --> 00:32:07,018
I have challenged him to a fight.

704
00:32:07,089 --> 00:32:08,021
Come on.

705
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:09,022
I'll hold this.

706
00:32:09,091 --> 00:32:11,184
Remember, it's an exhibition match,

707
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,727
so go on.

708
00:32:34,717 --> 00:32:36,116
Drunken boxing.

709
00:33:14,523 --> 00:33:16,388
Okay, that's enough.

710
00:33:16,459 --> 00:33:19,292
All right, that's enough.
The winner is Fei Hong.

711
00:33:19,362 --> 00:33:21,853
No. Really, it was a draw.

712
00:33:21,931 --> 00:33:22,863
I think Chang Tsan would agree.

713
00:33:22,932 --> 00:33:23,990
It's not over yet.

714
00:33:26,535 --> 00:33:27,832
Fei Hong!

715
00:33:27,903 --> 00:33:31,134
Yeah, I'm coming! It's my stepma.

716
00:33:31,207 --> 00:33:32,970
- Come on!
- I got to go. Thank you, Fun.

717
00:33:33,042 --> 00:33:35,033
See you tomorrow.

718
00:33:35,111 --> 00:33:36,043
- Fish.
- Why, thank you.

719
00:33:36,112 --> 00:33:37,477
What do I owe you for this?

720
00:33:37,546 --> 00:33:38,604
You can have it.

721
00:33:38,681 --> 00:33:40,444
Thanks a lot.

722
00:33:40,516 --> 00:33:42,279
Thank you. Excuse me.

723
00:33:42,351 --> 00:33:44,478
Everyone saw it was a draw, right?

724
00:33:44,553 --> 00:33:46,487
Okay, show over.

725
00:33:48,391 --> 00:33:50,359
Don't tell me you were
fighting for food again.

726
00:33:50,426 --> 00:33:51,358
Me? No way.

727
00:33:51,427 --> 00:33:52,416
You know your father will kill you

728
00:33:52,495 --> 00:33:53,621
if he hears about it.

729
00:33:53,763 --> 00:33:55,856
How can I replace the ginseng?

730
00:33:55,931 --> 00:33:57,330
Pawn my diamond necklace, that's how.

731
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,367
But, why?

732
00:33:58,434 --> 00:33:59,458
We'll be in big trouble

733
00:33:59,535 --> 00:34:01,730
if Mr. Chan decides
to brew that tree root.

734
00:34:01,804 --> 00:34:02,736
You would do that?

735
00:34:02,805 --> 00:34:05,865
Just remember, you owe me one.

736
00:34:05,941 --> 00:34:06,873
Yeah.

737
00:34:08,844 --> 00:34:11,711
That's the guy we're looking for.

738
00:34:11,781 --> 00:34:14,875
Stay close to him while I
go and get the boss, okay?

739
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:16,178
Yes, sir.

740
00:34:16,252 --> 00:34:18,345
Stop here.

741
00:34:18,421 --> 00:34:19,649
Okay, here's the money.

742
00:34:19,722 --> 00:34:21,053
I'm sure they're high quality.

743
00:34:21,123 --> 00:34:22,055
She got them from her husband.

744
00:34:22,124 --> 00:34:25,116
Look, I'm late already. Let's go, okay?

745
00:34:25,194 --> 00:34:27,822
So, was the drought very serious?

746
00:34:27,897 --> 00:34:29,091
In that province,

747
00:34:29,165 --> 00:34:31,099
rice and grain were scarce
before there was a drought.

748
00:34:31,167 --> 00:34:33,601
With no rainfall, there
will be no harvest,

749
00:34:33,669 --> 00:34:34,966
and that is serious.

750
00:34:35,037 --> 00:34:36,197
We must act now.

751
00:34:36,272 --> 00:34:37,398
It's so bad.

752
00:34:37,473 --> 00:34:38,906
They're so poor that some families

753
00:34:38,974 --> 00:34:40,737
have to share a single pair of pants.

754
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:42,402
Who gets to wear them?

755
00:34:42,478 --> 00:34:44,412
If you have job, you wear the pants.

756
00:34:45,481 --> 00:34:46,607
Hello. Sorry I'm late.

757
00:34:46,682 --> 00:34:49,082
It's all right. How are you?

758
00:34:49,151 --> 00:34:50,209
Good to see you.

759
00:34:50,286 --> 00:34:52,083
Fei Hong, don't you
think we should be going?

760
00:34:52,154 --> 00:34:54,645
Aren't you meeting my wife for tea?

761
00:34:54,723 --> 00:34:57,157
Not mahjong again.

762
00:34:57,226 --> 00:34:58,284
How can you say that?

763
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,292
It's our fund-raising meeting,

764
00:34:59,361 --> 00:35:01,226
and you were supposed to remind me.

765
00:35:01,297 --> 00:35:03,026
I almost forgot.
We'd better be going.

766
00:35:03,099 --> 00:35:04,396
You don't want to keep them waiting.

767
00:35:04,467 --> 00:35:05,399
You should go.

768
00:35:05,468 --> 00:35:06,400
Of course. You're right.

769
00:35:06,469 --> 00:35:07,663
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

770
00:35:07,736 --> 00:35:08,668
Good day.

771
00:35:08,737 --> 00:35:09,669
No mahjong!

772
00:35:09,738 --> 00:35:11,797
Yes, sir.

773
00:35:11,874 --> 00:35:13,808
This guy over here.

774
00:35:15,144 --> 00:35:16,611
Go tell John.

775
00:35:17,847 --> 00:35:20,008
It's been called to our attention

776
00:35:20,082 --> 00:35:22,448
that Master Wong needs
us to lend him some money.

777
00:35:22,518 --> 00:35:24,782
No, no, no. That's not for me.

778
00:35:24,854 --> 00:35:26,287
I'm sure I speak for everyone.

779
00:35:26,355 --> 00:35:27,287
We'll just take up a collection.

780
00:35:28,424 --> 00:35:30,255
I don't personally
need any of your money.

781
00:35:30,326 --> 00:35:31,315
It's for the drought victims.

782
00:35:31,393 --> 00:35:32,325
But your wife...

783
00:35:32,394 --> 00:35:34,089
Look, it's nothing to be ashamed of.

784
00:35:34,163 --> 00:35:35,152
This could happen to you.

785
00:35:35,231 --> 00:35:36,664
I say if Mr. Wong needs money...

786
00:35:36,732 --> 00:35:38,563
Nothing right now.

787
00:35:38,634 --> 00:35:39,566
You sure?

788
00:35:39,635 --> 00:35:40,567
You better not have said anything,

789
00:35:40,636 --> 00:35:41,898
you understand?

790
00:35:41,971 --> 00:35:43,370
I won't tell a soul.

791
00:35:43,439 --> 00:35:45,031
Besides, she's the one that talks a lot.

792
00:35:45,107 --> 00:35:46,597
Like you don't?

793
00:35:46,675 --> 00:35:49,576
How dare you say that?
I only told my sister...

794
00:35:49,645 --> 00:35:51,340
Qu doesn't even know I came here.

795
00:35:51,413 --> 00:35:53,608
Ladies, somebody has been talking.

796
00:35:53,682 --> 00:35:55,775
They always lie to me.
Look at their faces.

797
00:35:55,851 --> 00:35:57,409
Now, that's enough.

798
00:35:57,486 --> 00:35:59,477
Can't we just take a look?

799
00:35:59,555 --> 00:36:00,613
Let's see.

800
00:36:00,689 --> 00:36:01,621
There.

801
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:03,783
Careful!

802
00:36:03,859 --> 00:36:05,520
So beautiful.

803
00:36:11,967 --> 00:36:14,128
Don't handle it like that.

804
00:36:14,203 --> 00:36:15,465
And I'm only borrowing the money.

805
00:36:15,538 --> 00:36:16,971
You're going to have
to give it back to me.

806
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:19,098
I know, I know. I understand.

807
00:36:19,175 --> 00:36:20,506
Come on. Show it to us.

808
00:36:20,576 --> 00:36:21,508
Here.

809
00:36:21,577 --> 00:36:23,067
So, did you get it?

810
00:36:23,145 --> 00:36:24,373
No. I haven't actually seen it,

811
00:36:24,446 --> 00:36:26,004
but I'm sure they have it.

812
00:36:26,081 --> 00:36:27,912
Well, we can't waste any more time.

813
00:36:27,983 --> 00:36:31,146
Grab the seal, and
we'll meet you out front.

814
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,915
Okay, grab it, and I'll see you outside.

815
00:36:32,988 --> 00:36:34,979
You're so lucky.

816
00:36:35,057 --> 00:36:36,422
You're lucky.

817
00:36:36,492 --> 00:36:39,188
It's so beautiful on you.

818
00:36:39,261 --> 00:36:40,694
Wait!

819
00:36:42,031 --> 00:36:44,090
The necklace is gone.

820
00:36:44,166 --> 00:36:45,758
You've got to learn to speak up.

821
00:36:45,834 --> 00:36:47,699
Stop him!

822
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:51,863
Stop! Come on!

823
00:36:51,941 --> 00:36:53,374
Let's go!

824
00:37:00,616 --> 00:37:02,516
Leave it.

825
00:37:04,353 --> 00:37:05,445
Fei Hong!

826
00:37:05,521 --> 00:37:06,510
It's over there!

827
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:09,617
He went that way! Go!

828
00:37:09,692 --> 00:37:10,852
Excuse me!

829
00:37:23,005 --> 00:37:23,937
You better run.

830
00:37:24,006 --> 00:37:25,564
Fei Hong, you're my hero!

831
00:37:25,641 --> 00:37:28,872
You are a hero.

832
00:37:30,145 --> 00:37:31,077
You see that?

833
00:37:31,146 --> 00:37:32,807
Atta way.

834
00:37:36,952 --> 00:37:38,044
What's this?

835
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,144
You bumped me.

836
00:37:39,221 --> 00:37:41,451
I'm sorry about that.

837
00:37:41,523 --> 00:37:42,785
No. That's not good enough.

838
00:37:44,193 --> 00:37:45,125
Did I miss something?

839
00:37:45,194 --> 00:37:47,458
Get on your knees and bow... right now.

840
00:37:47,529 --> 00:37:49,463
What? You must be out of your mind.

841
00:37:49,531 --> 00:37:50,520
Leave him alone.

842
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:52,794
You were in on it. I
saw the whole thing.

843
00:37:52,868 --> 00:37:54,392
Why don't you mind your
own business, bitch?

844
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:56,335
Who you calling bitch?

845
00:37:56,405 --> 00:37:57,633
I can't let him get away with that.

846
00:37:57,706 --> 00:37:59,037
And who the hell do you think you are

847
00:37:59,108 --> 00:38:00,632
strutting around here like a peacock

848
00:38:00,709 --> 00:38:02,233
in that bad English suit of yours?

849
00:38:02,311 --> 00:38:03,746
I think I should kick your ass.

850
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,744
Yeah?

851
00:38:04,814 --> 00:38:05,906
Wait!

852
00:38:07,083 --> 00:38:08,072
Mom, are you all right?

853
00:38:08,151 --> 00:38:09,118
Go away.

854
00:38:09,185 --> 00:38:11,244
I want this guy. I can taste it.

855
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,049
Take it easy. You'll be okay.

856
00:38:13,122 --> 00:38:14,646
She wants to fight?

857
00:38:14,724 --> 00:38:15,748
We'll take the two of you.

858
00:38:15,825 --> 00:38:18,123
What? You're going to start this again?

859
00:38:19,829 --> 00:38:20,761
What'd you say?

860
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:22,058
I said, kick his ass!

861
00:38:22,131 --> 00:38:23,155
You want me to go kick...

862
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:25,166
You will, or I will.

863
00:38:25,234 --> 00:38:26,166
All right.

864
00:38:26,235 --> 00:38:27,668
What happened?

865
00:38:27,737 --> 00:38:28,669
I'm all right.

866
00:38:33,976 --> 00:38:36,171
He's a very good fighter.

867
00:38:36,245 --> 00:38:38,338
The necklace is inside.
It's going to be ruined!

868
00:38:38,414 --> 00:38:39,381
The necklace?

869
00:38:39,448 --> 00:38:41,643
Over here, Fei Hong!

870
00:38:41,717 --> 00:38:43,241
Here.

871
00:38:52,728 --> 00:38:56,220
Where'd he learn to do that?

872
00:38:56,299 --> 00:38:57,789
Po Chi Lam.

873
00:38:57,867 --> 00:38:59,528
He does drunken boxing, doesn't he?

874
00:38:59,602 --> 00:39:00,899
Well, then, maybe he'll give us

875
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:03,837
an exhibition on drunken boxing.

876
00:39:03,906 --> 00:39:05,237
All right.

877
00:39:05,308 --> 00:39:08,277
Whatever you want. Fei Hong! Come here!

878
00:39:10,913 --> 00:39:12,380
All right-

879
00:39:12,448 --> 00:39:14,040
time for drunken boxing.

880
00:39:14,116 --> 00:39:15,344
What about Father?

881
00:39:15,418 --> 00:39:16,350
I'll take care of him.

882
00:39:16,419 --> 00:39:18,011
Besides, it will be great publicity

883
00:39:18,087 --> 00:39:19,019
for the school.

884
00:39:19,088 --> 00:39:20,146
Your dad will be happy.

885
00:39:20,223 --> 00:39:21,155
Okay.

886
00:39:21,224 --> 00:39:22,657
Drunken boxing!

887
00:39:22,725 --> 00:39:25,125
All right, what are you scared of?

888
00:39:25,194 --> 00:39:26,491
Four of you guys can't beat one?

889
00:39:39,508 --> 00:39:40,770
Get him!

890
00:39:53,089 --> 00:39:54,147
What is that?

891
00:39:54,223 --> 00:39:55,155
It's drunken boxing.

892
00:39:56,225 --> 00:39:57,157
Come on, now. What do you think?

893
00:39:57,226 --> 00:39:58,158
Well, can he do more?

894
00:39:58,227 --> 00:39:59,524
Of course he can. Yeah.

895
00:39:59,595 --> 00:40:01,529
You're a bunch of fools.

896
00:40:01,597 --> 00:40:02,894
Come on.

897
00:40:02,965 --> 00:40:04,296
Let's go.

898
00:40:04,367 --> 00:40:05,299
Wait for us.

899
00:40:08,037 --> 00:40:09,231
Take as much as you can carry.

900
00:40:09,305 --> 00:40:10,237
Okay.

901
00:40:10,306 --> 00:40:11,534
Who's going to pay for that?

902
00:40:11,607 --> 00:40:13,074
Master Wong's charge account.

903
00:40:13,142 --> 00:40:14,074
All right, then.

904
00:40:16,746 --> 00:40:18,839
Where'd they go?

905
00:40:18,915 --> 00:40:19,904
Over there, I think.

906
00:40:19,982 --> 00:40:21,745
- Let's go.
- Wait for us! Hurry, ladies!

907
00:40:24,787 --> 00:40:25,981
What are they doing?

908
00:40:26,055 --> 00:40:27,181
What's that?

909
00:40:27,256 --> 00:40:28,655
Don't know.

910
00:40:30,293 --> 00:40:32,420
I'm going to call the police.

911
00:40:32,495 --> 00:40:33,553
Don't do that.

912
00:40:33,629 --> 00:40:36,723
Fei Hong, I brought you some help.

913
00:40:36,799 --> 00:40:37,731
But Father will kill me.

914
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,700
You can blame it all on me.

915
00:40:39,769 --> 00:40:40,736
You're going to lose if you don't,

916
00:40:40,803 --> 00:40:41,735
so just go ahead.

917
00:40:43,072 --> 00:40:44,039
Yeah.

918
00:40:47,476 --> 00:40:49,137
Here you go... another bottle.

919
00:40:54,984 --> 00:40:57,384
Two at once?

920
00:40:57,453 --> 00:40:59,580
Do you think that's a good idea?

921
00:40:59,655 --> 00:41:00,917
Don't worry. It gives him power.

922
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:36,123
Are you all right?

923
00:41:36,192 --> 00:41:38,023
What?

924
00:41:39,562 --> 00:41:41,052
One more drink would be helpful.

925
00:41:42,698 --> 00:41:43,790
Here is the very last bottle.

926
00:41:55,444 --> 00:41:56,376
You, get up!

927
00:42:04,153 --> 00:42:05,518
What the hell was that?

928
00:42:07,423 --> 00:42:08,355
What does it mean

929
00:42:08,424 --> 00:42:09,482
when there's a picture of a skull?

930
00:42:09,558 --> 00:42:12,049
Good stuff.

931
00:42:22,838 --> 00:42:24,465
The last one really hit the spot.

932
00:42:32,314 --> 00:42:34,680
Monkey Drinks Master's Wine.

933
00:42:41,123 --> 00:42:42,818
That was Crazy Corkscrew

934
00:42:42,892 --> 00:42:43,950
Open Wine Bottle.

935
00:42:45,194 --> 00:42:47,628
White Tiger Washes Face.

936
00:42:49,565 --> 00:42:51,032
Turn the Barrel!

937
00:42:52,234 --> 00:42:53,565
What's wrong? You have a hangover?

938
00:42:53,636 --> 00:42:54,967
Kill him!

939
00:42:55,037 --> 00:42:56,800
Do you like Drunken Monkey?

940
00:43:02,745 --> 00:43:04,542
Eagle Carries Wine Bottle.

941
00:43:04,613 --> 00:43:05,545
Got you now!

942
00:43:08,751 --> 00:43:10,275
Attack! Waterfall!

943
00:43:11,654 --> 00:43:13,815
That one there, I showed him.

944
00:43:13,889 --> 00:43:16,289
Here is Peter Piper Playing the Flute.

945
00:43:17,893 --> 00:43:20,054
That's a good one.

946
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,631
Down the Hatch!

947
00:43:28,104 --> 00:43:30,004
Wheelbarrow.

948
00:43:35,744 --> 00:43:38,304
Drunken Maid Flirting With the Master.

949
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:42,683
Snake Eyes.

950
00:43:53,829 --> 00:43:55,592
And this one?

951
00:43:55,664 --> 00:43:57,564
Gypsy Wine.

952
00:43:57,633 --> 00:43:59,100
It's called Gypsy what?

953
00:43:59,168 --> 00:44:00,567
Just watch.

954
00:44:03,072 --> 00:44:05,233
Uncle Stirs the Barrel.

955
00:44:14,717 --> 00:44:16,480
Come back!

956
00:44:16,552 --> 00:44:17,484
Fei Hong!

957
00:44:17,553 --> 00:44:18,520
He can't even stand up straight!

958
00:44:18,587 --> 00:44:19,679
Find some more wine.

959
00:44:19,755 --> 00:44:20,687
Of course.

960
00:44:21,757 --> 00:44:23,588
Master Wong! What's going on here?

961
00:44:23,659 --> 00:44:26,287
Those men are attacking Fei Hong!

962
00:44:26,362 --> 00:44:28,091
Hold this. Fei Hong!

963
00:44:29,765 --> 00:44:30,697
Fei Hong!

964
00:44:30,766 --> 00:44:32,199
Smash Bottle Against the Wall!

965
00:44:37,173 --> 00:44:39,198
Fei Hong!

966
00:44:39,275 --> 00:44:41,038
Have you been drinking?

967
00:44:42,811 --> 00:44:44,574
You stop it right now!

968
00:44:46,549 --> 00:44:48,176
Down the Hatch!

969
00:44:51,086 --> 00:44:52,018
What are you doing?

970
00:44:52,087 --> 00:44:53,884
Father?

971
00:44:59,094 --> 00:45:01,654
You have the cutest little nose.

972
00:45:04,433 --> 00:45:06,333
Look how well they get along.

973
00:45:06,402 --> 00:45:08,734
How are you, Dad?

974
00:45:08,804 --> 00:45:10,066
Fighting again!

975
00:45:10,139 --> 00:45:11,629
Fighting? okay.

976
00:45:11,707 --> 00:45:13,504
You should have been here.

977
00:45:13,576 --> 00:45:15,271
Fei Hong defeated all
five of those gangsters.

978
00:45:15,344 --> 00:45:17,175
What was this all about?

979
00:45:17,246 --> 00:45:18,679
They tried to steal the diamond necklace

980
00:45:18,747 --> 00:45:19,907
that Ling sold to me.

981
00:45:19,982 --> 00:45:21,574
What?

982
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:23,777
You sold your diamond necklace?

983
00:45:23,852 --> 00:45:26,343
Why didn't you tell us Po
Chi Lam needed more money?

984
00:45:26,422 --> 00:45:28,617
We would have helped you. You
know we're all friends here.

985
00:45:28,691 --> 00:45:31,524
No. The school doesn't need money.

986
00:45:31,594 --> 00:45:33,926
Here, you can take charge
of the funds we raised.

987
00:45:35,831 --> 00:45:38,527
Stop that! Fei Hong!

988
00:45:39,602 --> 00:45:41,069
Hello, Madam Wong.

989
00:45:41,136 --> 00:45:42,433
I said stop it!

990
00:45:42,504 --> 00:45:44,267
No, please, Master Wong, don't hurt him!

991
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,307
He's drunk!

992
00:45:45,374 --> 00:45:47,308
Mom, fetch me another bottle.

993
00:45:47,376 --> 00:45:48,604
Go home now!

994
00:45:48,677 --> 00:45:49,974
Now!

995
00:45:50,045 --> 00:45:52,036
Yes, dear.

996
00:45:52,114 --> 00:45:55,709
Do as he says. All right.

997
00:45:55,784 --> 00:45:56,910
See you.

998
00:45:56,986 --> 00:46:02,686
Go home now, Daddy

999
00:46:02,758 --> 00:46:06,592
Go on. Follow him!

1000
00:46:06,662 --> 00:46:08,095
Losers.

1001
00:46:08,163 --> 00:46:09,665
You didn't do any better.

1002
00:46:09,799 --> 00:46:11,426
And what were you trying to do?

1003
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,331
You've ruined the school's reputation!

1004
00:46:13,402 --> 00:46:14,528
They think we're broke!

1005
00:46:14,603 --> 00:46:16,969
And you, you idiot, what have I told you

1006
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:19,803
about drunken boxing and
fighting in the streets?

1007
00:46:19,875 --> 00:46:22,708
Now, tell me, is everything here so bad

1008
00:46:22,778 --> 00:46:24,006
you have to sell your diamonds?

1009
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,843
Come on! Do you really think

1010
00:46:25,915 --> 00:46:27,507
I would have sold something

1011
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,982
that's precious to us? I would never!

1012
00:46:29,051 --> 00:46:31,246
Don't lie to me!

1013
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,345
How much money did you
lose playing mahjong?

1014
00:46:33,422 --> 00:46:34,616
Well, how much?

1015
00:46:36,025 --> 00:46:38,459
I always win at mah-jongg.

1016
00:46:38,527 --> 00:46:39,858
You don't know what
you're talking about.

1017
00:46:39,929 --> 00:46:41,362
Besides, who are you going to believe,

1018
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:42,397
me or friends?

1019
00:46:42,465 --> 00:46:44,797
Stepma, I believe you.

1020
00:46:44,867 --> 00:46:46,835
Shut up!

1021
00:46:46,902 --> 00:46:49,166
Did you hear what I told you? Shut up!

1022
00:46:49,238 --> 00:46:50,671
You disobeyed me!

1023
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:53,208
I said absolutely no
fighting and no drinking.

1024
00:46:53,275 --> 00:46:55,743
And above all, no drunken boxing!

1025
00:46:57,213 --> 00:46:59,704
You even fought with
me, your own father!

1026
00:46:59,782 --> 00:47:01,807
You disgraced your family name!

1027
00:47:01,884 --> 00:47:03,715
Wait! Wait! Hold on!

1028
00:47:03,786 --> 00:47:04,718
Would you stop hitting him?

1029
00:47:04,787 --> 00:47:06,186
He was just defending me!

1030
00:47:06,255 --> 00:47:07,688
They tried to break my jaw.

1031
00:47:07,757 --> 00:47:09,281
I guess that's something
you don't care about.

1032
00:47:09,358 --> 00:47:12,657
Damn you, woman! It was forbidden!

1033
00:47:12,728 --> 00:47:14,787
They could have killed him.
Don't you care about that?

1034
00:47:14,864 --> 00:47:17,697
Sure. Like it matters.

1035
00:47:17,767 --> 00:47:20,861
You're beating him worse
than those guys ever did.

1036
00:47:20,936 --> 00:47:23,700
You're driving me insane!

1037
00:47:25,441 --> 00:47:27,432
I can't believe this!

1038
00:47:33,048 --> 00:47:34,208
What's this?

1039
00:47:36,285 --> 00:47:40,585
What has happened to
my 300-year-old bonsai?

1040
00:47:40,656 --> 00:47:42,283
I forgot to throw it out!

1041
00:47:42,358 --> 00:47:43,757
Mr. Cho!

1042
00:47:45,795 --> 00:47:47,695
What went wrong?

1043
00:47:47,763 --> 00:47:50,163
You know this garden
is your responsibility

1044
00:47:50,232 --> 00:47:52,325
and I expect an answer! Well?

1045
00:47:52,401 --> 00:47:54,562
Just hold on!

1046
00:47:54,637 --> 00:47:56,969
You shouldn't blame
everything on him that way,

1047
00:47:57,039 --> 00:48:00,008
because I was actually
the one who did it.

1048
00:48:00,075 --> 00:48:02,441
I was practising my kung fu

1049
00:48:02,511 --> 00:48:05,139
and then I tripped over
that statue right over there.

1050
00:48:05,214 --> 00:48:07,409
Luckily, the tree was there to grab.

1051
00:48:07,483 --> 00:48:09,144
God only knows, I could
have gotten killed,

1052
00:48:09,218 --> 00:48:11,516
but I see now you don't care. Well.

1053
00:48:11,587 --> 00:48:13,953
You know that's not it, Ling.

1054
00:48:14,023 --> 00:48:15,718
I am so sick and tired
of your deception!

1055
00:48:15,791 --> 00:48:18,521
If you're going to hit me, just go on.

1056
00:48:20,963 --> 00:48:23,761
You know, that's not a bad idea.

1057
00:48:23,833 --> 00:48:25,198
It's time you showed me respect.

1058
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,865
That's not gonna work this time!

1059
00:48:34,376 --> 00:48:39,279
You've been hurting me so I
won't cause any more trouble.

1060
00:48:39,348 --> 00:48:40,838
You're driving me out of my mind!

1061
00:48:43,552 --> 00:48:45,986
Hit me all right!

1062
00:48:46,055 --> 00:48:47,044
Over the head! Kill me!

1063
00:48:47,122 --> 00:48:48,987
Kill me and the little one inside me!

1064
00:48:49,058 --> 00:48:51,185
Little one?

1065
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:52,284
Is that so?

1066
00:48:52,361 --> 00:48:53,885
We're going to have a baby?

1067
00:48:55,931 --> 00:48:57,762
Why didn't you tell me?

1068
00:48:57,833 --> 00:48:59,528
- Never!
- Come inside.

1069
00:48:59,602 --> 00:49:01,661
You told me to get on
my knees, so here I am!

1070
00:49:01,737 --> 00:49:05,468
On my knees! It doesn't
matter if I'm pregnant!

1071
00:49:05,541 --> 00:49:08,772
Mom has a little baby!

1072
00:49:08,844 --> 00:49:10,641
I apologise. I wouldn't hit you.

1073
00:49:10,713 --> 00:49:12,613
Get away! You said enough!

1074
00:49:12,681 --> 00:49:15,047
Ling, no! You will hurt the baby!

1075
00:49:15,117 --> 00:49:17,585
- Then put me down!
- okay.

1076
00:49:17,653 --> 00:49:18,745
Leave me alone, I said!

1077
00:49:18,821 --> 00:49:21,415
No! You have to stop this!

1078
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:23,048
All right, I will.

1079
00:49:23,125 --> 00:49:24,183
Are you all right?

1080
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:25,693
There's no way I'll forgive you!

1081
00:49:25,761 --> 00:49:27,228
What are you doing?

1082
00:49:27,296 --> 00:49:29,787
This is all my fault. Please be careful.

1083
00:49:29,865 --> 00:49:31,264
Get Madam a chair! Quickly!

1084
00:49:31,333 --> 00:49:33,130
What are you waiting for?

1085
00:49:33,202 --> 00:49:34,635
I'm begging you, Ling.

1086
00:49:34,703 --> 00:49:36,432
Sit over there, you'll be all right.

1087
00:49:39,241 --> 00:49:41,072
Sorry.

1088
00:49:42,144 --> 00:49:43,338
Ling, I'm so sorry.

1089
00:49:43,412 --> 00:49:44,572
How dare you?!

1090
00:49:44,647 --> 00:49:47,616
It was an accident, Ling.

1091
00:49:47,683 --> 00:49:48,615
Let me help you.

1092
00:49:48,684 --> 00:49:49,844
You did it on purpose.

1093
00:49:49,919 --> 00:49:51,250
Now, of course I didn't.

1094
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:54,448
Don't lie. Haven't you done enough?

1095
00:49:54,523 --> 00:49:55,547
Is the baby all right?

1096
00:49:55,624 --> 00:49:57,114
Stop it!

1097
00:50:00,129 --> 00:50:01,528
It's fine.

1098
00:50:01,597 --> 00:50:03,531
Good. Are you comfortable?

1099
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:06,033
Master Wong, Mrs. . Chan is here.

1100
00:50:06,101 --> 00:50:07,966
She has a bit of a problem.

1101
00:50:08,037 --> 00:50:10,562
You stay right here. I'll be right back.

1102
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:13,767
Congratulations, Father.
I'm really proud of you.

1103
00:50:13,842 --> 00:50:16,606
Thank you.

1104
00:50:16,679 --> 00:50:18,340
Mrs. Chan, it's such a pleasure.

1105
00:50:18,414 --> 00:50:22,510
Dr. Wong, this really isn't ginseng.

1106
00:50:22,584 --> 00:50:25,018
I showed it to another doctor

1107
00:50:25,087 --> 00:50:27,055
and he says it's poisonous.

1108
00:50:27,122 --> 00:50:29,113
Now, I'm not sure where you got it,

1109
00:50:29,191 --> 00:50:30,886
but you've surely been misled.

1110
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,394
It has made my husband deathly ill.

1111
00:50:33,462 --> 00:50:36,397
Thank God he only brewed half of it.

1112
00:50:36,465 --> 00:50:38,990
You owe me, and you're going to have to

1113
00:50:39,068 --> 00:50:42,094
take the blame for this mess. Now!

1114
00:50:43,372 --> 00:50:46,864
Forgive me. Uncle Ho,
get the snake extract.

1115
00:50:46,942 --> 00:50:48,807
I can assure you he will recover

1116
00:50:48,877 --> 00:50:50,037
if you give him this.

1117
00:50:50,112 --> 00:50:53,081
Dr. Wong, this is wonderful.

1118
00:50:53,148 --> 00:50:54,775
I promise I won't tell anyone.

1119
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:56,909
It must have been a mistake.

1120
00:50:56,986 --> 00:50:58,419
Good day, madam.

1121
00:50:58,487 --> 00:51:00,717
Mrs. Good day.

1122
00:51:00,789 --> 00:51:02,222
Well?

1123
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:05,684
Get over here, Cho!

1124
00:51:10,232 --> 00:51:11,164
What's this?

1125
00:51:11,233 --> 00:51:14,964
He did it! Fei Hong!

1126
00:51:23,412 --> 00:51:25,676
How could you do such a thing?

1127
00:51:25,748 --> 00:51:28,273
Are you out of your mind?

1128
00:51:29,518 --> 00:51:32,009
You are destroying my reputation!

1129
00:51:32,087 --> 00:51:36,922
Here you go, Father. You
dropped your bonsai tree.

1130
00:51:36,992 --> 00:51:39,927
That's it! I'm gonna kill you!

1131
00:51:39,995 --> 00:51:42,725
Ruin me! Drunk!

1132
00:51:42,798 --> 00:51:44,197
Wait, Wong, don't!

1133
00:51:44,266 --> 00:51:48,032
Hurt my friends! That's it!

1134
00:51:48,103 --> 00:51:50,833
Just listen! It was stolen off the train

1135
00:51:50,906 --> 00:51:52,703
and he couldn't get it back!

1136
00:51:52,775 --> 00:51:55,437
What am I saying?

1137
00:51:55,511 --> 00:51:57,502
See, he was trying to save you some tax.

1138
00:51:57,579 --> 00:51:59,979
How would he have known
the ginseng would be stolen?

1139
00:52:00,049 --> 00:52:01,983
The ginseng was stolen?

1140
00:52:02,051 --> 00:52:04,349
Even so, he still lied to me!

1141
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:06,581
No! Not acceptable!

1142
00:52:06,655 --> 00:52:08,088
You shouldn't defend him!

1143
00:52:08,157 --> 00:52:10,318
He's a thief and a drunk.
Just stay out of it!

1144
00:52:10,392 --> 00:52:11,324
I'm thirsty.

1145
00:52:11,393 --> 00:52:12,451
Yeah?

1146
00:52:12,528 --> 00:52:16,828
You like some wine?
Just stay right there.

1147
00:52:24,239 --> 00:52:27,140
I'll give you some
wine. Come on, open up.

1148
00:52:29,945 --> 00:52:31,936
Come on, drink!

1149
00:52:33,549 --> 00:52:36,484
Stop it, Wong! Stop!

1150
00:52:36,552 --> 00:52:39,146
No more! What are you doing?

1151
00:52:46,528 --> 00:52:48,587
You're going to fight me now?

1152
00:52:48,664 --> 00:52:50,598
I disown you!

1153
00:52:50,666 --> 00:52:53,999
You are not my son!

1154
00:52:54,069 --> 00:52:56,469
Now, get out!

1155
00:52:56,538 --> 00:52:59,098
You better do as I say!

1156
00:52:59,174 --> 00:53:02,371
Get out!

1157
00:53:02,444 --> 00:53:06,141
Come on! Get out of here!

1158
00:53:10,619 --> 00:53:12,109
Stop it! That's enough!

1159
00:53:12,187 --> 00:53:15,384
You're going to kill him!

1160
00:53:17,559 --> 00:53:20,392
That's enough, Wong!

1161
00:53:25,167 --> 00:53:29,399
Please, don't! Please!

1162
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:32,338
You're killing him, Wong, can't you see?

1163
00:53:32,407 --> 00:53:35,308
I don't care! I want him out!

1164
00:53:36,378 --> 00:53:37,538
Father!

1165
00:53:39,248 --> 00:53:41,341
Up! Get out of here!

1166
00:53:47,089 --> 00:53:49,853
That was self-defence!
He didn't mean to do it!

1167
00:53:49,925 --> 00:53:51,256
Tell your father you're sorry!

1168
00:53:51,326 --> 00:53:53,226
Out!

1169
00:53:53,295 --> 00:53:54,853
Now!

1170
00:53:55,931 --> 00:53:58,161
Fei Hong! Come back!

1171
00:53:58,233 --> 00:54:00,463
After him, Cho! Don't let him go!

1172
00:54:05,274 --> 00:54:06,366
Cho!

1173
00:54:08,343 --> 00:54:10,277
That way.

1174
00:54:11,513 --> 00:54:12,673
Yes.

1175
00:54:18,765 --> 00:54:20,357
How many you want?

1176
00:54:20,433 --> 00:54:23,527
Excuse me, sir. Where can
I find the herbal shop?

1177
00:54:23,603 --> 00:54:24,627
Right down on left.

1178
00:54:24,704 --> 00:54:26,194
Thank you. Here you go.

1179
00:54:26,272 --> 00:54:28,172
Hello. Beer, please.

1180
00:54:28,241 --> 00:54:29,765
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.

1181
00:54:32,345 --> 00:54:34,279
I've never seen you drink so much.

1182
00:54:34,347 --> 00:54:35,336
You know your father's going to be

1183
00:54:35,415 --> 00:54:37,975
very angry with you, Fei Hong.

1184
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:40,644
Let's not talk about this.

1185
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,415
Bring me another drink.

1186
00:54:42,488 --> 00:54:43,580
Keep it coming.

1187
00:54:43,656 --> 00:54:45,749
No way. That's it for tonight.

1188
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:50,352
Excuse me, miss?

1189
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:52,523
I want a song here.

1190
00:54:52,598 --> 00:54:55,260
Something I should sing?

1191
00:54:55,334 --> 00:54:58,895
The Ocean's Crying, but I sing it.

1192
00:55:00,573 --> 00:55:02,803
You play for me now?

1193
00:55:02,875 --> 00:55:04,433
Okay.

1194
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:12,677
I am so sent down

1195
00:55:14,353 --> 00:55:17,049
I was so happy and now

1196
00:55:17,123 --> 00:55:20,217
I'm all alone with no home

1197
00:55:20,293 --> 00:55:23,091
What can I do?

1198
00:55:23,162 --> 00:55:26,029
If not for the wine

1199
00:55:26,098 --> 00:55:30,432
I'd be hurting all the time

1200
00:55:30,503 --> 00:55:34,872
If only I could go home

1201
00:55:34,941 --> 00:55:38,502
Father, listen to me now

1202
00:55:38,578 --> 00:55:41,775
What can I do to make it up

1203
00:55:41,848 --> 00:55:45,011
To make you proud

1204
00:55:45,084 --> 00:55:48,281
Make you proud

1205
00:55:48,354 --> 00:55:52,017
I only tried to help

1206
00:55:52,091 --> 00:55:54,651
When I saw the bonsai tree

1207
00:55:54,727 --> 00:55:57,924
I thought I was so smart

1208
00:55:57,997 --> 00:55:59,191
Why did you...

1209
00:55:59,265 --> 00:56:01,495
There he is, right over there.

1210
00:56:01,567 --> 00:56:03,125
He doesn't look so bad.

1211
00:56:03,202 --> 00:56:04,635
Yes, he is.

1212
00:56:04,704 --> 00:56:07,468
He's real tough. A fighter.

1213
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:10,202
Well, let's just see about this.

1214
00:56:10,276 --> 00:56:12,210
I still love you

1215
00:56:12,278 --> 00:56:14,872
No matter what you...

1216
00:56:14,947 --> 00:56:17,211
Party's over. I suggest you go.

1217
00:56:17,283 --> 00:56:19,410
No matter what you do

1218
00:56:19,485 --> 00:56:21,146
What? You stop that!

1219
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:23,279
Love you

1220
00:56:23,356 --> 00:56:24,823
You shut up! Listen to me!

1221
00:56:24,891 --> 00:56:27,325
The rest of you, go on home!

1222
00:56:27,393 --> 00:56:28,587
Go on! Get out of here!

1223
00:56:28,661 --> 00:56:30,595
Yeah. You gotta leave.

1224
00:56:30,663 --> 00:56:32,130
Go on. Move!

1225
00:56:32,198 --> 00:56:34,598
Let's get out of the way.

1226
00:56:34,667 --> 00:56:38,068
What happened to the music?

1227
00:56:46,245 --> 00:56:47,712
Are you the drunken boxer?

1228
00:56:49,148 --> 00:56:52,276
Sure. I'm pretty drunk,

1229
00:56:52,351 --> 00:56:54,717
but I don't know about boxing.

1230
00:56:54,787 --> 00:56:56,755
He's just faking.

1231
00:57:05,164 --> 00:57:08,930
Come on. What's the matter with you?

1232
00:57:09,001 --> 00:57:10,593
Get up and fight me!

1233
00:57:12,438 --> 00:57:14,963
That's Fei Hong.

1234
00:57:15,041 --> 00:57:16,736
Out of my way! What are you doing?

1235
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:19,209
It's none of your goddam business.

1236
00:57:25,051 --> 00:57:26,313
Get him out!

1237
00:57:26,385 --> 00:57:30,014
What's going on? Is
this some kind of joke?

1238
00:57:30,089 --> 00:57:32,114
No! You should have seen him!

1239
00:57:32,191 --> 00:57:34,250
He couldn't be stopped. Ask anyone.

1240
00:57:34,327 --> 00:57:36,124
I'll stop him.

1241
00:57:41,701 --> 00:57:43,498
We finished him!

1242
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:49,467
Why you kick me?

1243
00:57:49,542 --> 00:57:53,535
Look at you. Get up
and fight me! Come on!

1244
00:57:53,613 --> 00:57:56,446
Get this drunk out of my sight!

1245
00:57:56,515 --> 00:57:58,278
Go! Go on! Kill him!

1246
00:57:58,351 --> 00:58:00,512
No, wait. Not yet.

1247
00:58:00,586 --> 00:58:03,885
Don't kill him, teach him a lesson.

1248
00:58:03,956 --> 00:58:05,719
All right, you've had it now.

1249
00:58:05,791 --> 00:58:07,053
Careful, he's tricky!

1250
00:58:10,363 --> 00:58:11,625
Fei Hong.

1251
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:12,959
He's hurt bad, yeah.

1252
00:58:14,066 --> 00:58:15,033
Come.

1253
00:58:15,101 --> 00:58:17,934
That's bad. Let's go.

1254
00:58:22,108 --> 00:58:23,439
Fei Hong!

1255
00:58:26,912 --> 00:58:27,879
Up there!

1256
00:58:27,947 --> 00:58:28,879
Wang!

1257
00:58:32,451 --> 00:58:35,887
Get him! Cut him down!

1258
00:58:45,277 --> 00:58:48,212
Fei Hong, don't be ashamed.

1259
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:52,683
When we were kids, we used
to go naked all the time.

1260
00:58:52,751 --> 00:58:55,015
I should have found you sooner.

1261
00:58:55,087 --> 00:58:58,386
You'll be okay. Just give it some time.

1262
00:59:00,425 --> 00:59:01,858
By the way...

1263
00:59:01,927 --> 00:59:04,157
I have some good news, too.

1264
00:59:04,229 --> 00:59:07,790
Just listen to me. Guess what.

1265
00:59:07,866 --> 00:59:10,699
Every woman in town
wants to be your wife.

1266
00:59:10,769 --> 00:59:12,532
It's the truth.

1267
00:59:12,604 --> 00:59:15,596
All right. Come on.

1268
00:59:15,674 --> 00:59:17,505
Dry your eyes.

1269
00:59:19,578 --> 00:59:20,567
I know.

1270
00:59:23,015 --> 00:59:25,848
I have a good reason to
forbid drunken boxing.

1271
00:59:25,917 --> 00:59:29,182
Those who practice it
frequently wind up as alcoholics.

1272
00:59:29,254 --> 00:59:31,620
Not if one uses restraint
and self discipline.

1273
00:59:31,690 --> 00:59:33,851
But that's more difficult
than you might think.

1274
00:59:33,925 --> 00:59:37,952
It's true that alcohol
can make the body loose

1275
00:59:38,030 --> 00:59:39,497
and its pain threshold higher,

1276
00:59:39,564 --> 00:59:42,829
but it's difficult to
drink the proper amount.

1277
00:59:42,901 --> 00:59:45,165
Many drunken boxers become nothing more

1278
00:59:45,237 --> 00:59:47,205
than drunken fools.

1279
00:59:47,272 --> 00:59:49,103
The odds of bringing shame and disgrace

1280
00:59:49,174 --> 00:59:52,337
upon oneself and one's
family is just too great.

1281
00:59:52,411 --> 00:59:55,039
It also reminds me there
is an ancient proverb

1282
00:59:55,113 --> 00:59:57,946
that equates the drinking
of alcohol with water-

1283
00:59:58,016 --> 01:00:01,349
"Boats can float on
water," or so it says,

1284
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:03,320
"but they can sink in it, too."

1285
01:00:03,388 --> 01:00:04,946
Now, that's a profound lesson.

1286
01:00:05,023 --> 01:00:06,456
I have only one question.

1287
01:00:06,525 --> 01:00:07,457
What?

1288
01:00:07,526 --> 01:00:09,050
Whose boat are we talking about?

1289
01:00:27,579 --> 01:00:29,706
I will never drink again.

1290
01:00:39,224 --> 01:00:41,954
There, Fei Hong.

1291
01:00:42,027 --> 01:00:43,858
I'm glad to see that you're okay now.

1292
01:00:43,929 --> 01:00:45,863
Come on, let's get up and
thank all your friends here

1293
01:00:45,931 --> 01:00:47,899
for helping you. Go on.

1294
01:00:47,966 --> 01:00:49,900
Fei Hong, you okay?

1295
01:00:49,968 --> 01:00:52,664
Thank you.

1296
01:00:52,738 --> 01:00:55,036
You okay?

1297
01:00:55,107 --> 01:00:56,540
You should...

1298
01:00:56,608 --> 01:00:58,872
Don't ever give up.
You'll be better now.

1299
01:00:58,944 --> 01:01:00,343
Everybody makes mistakes.

1300
01:01:00,412 --> 01:01:01,845
How's the baby today?

1301
01:01:01,913 --> 01:01:03,744
He's just fine. Let him be.

1302
01:01:03,815 --> 01:01:06,340
All right.

1303
01:01:22,734 --> 01:01:24,258
Sorry, we are closed now.

1304
01:01:25,637 --> 01:01:27,571
Where's Fei Hong?

1305
01:01:27,639 --> 01:01:28,628
Excuse me?

1306
01:01:28,707 --> 01:01:29,901
Is he here?

1307
01:01:29,975 --> 01:01:31,772
He might be. What for?

1308
01:01:31,843 --> 01:01:33,333
It's private.

1309
01:01:34,646 --> 01:01:36,204
May I come in?

1310
01:01:37,749 --> 01:01:39,740
Well, in that case...

1311
01:01:41,887 --> 01:01:43,821
I know who sent you.

1312
01:01:43,889 --> 01:01:47,052
What was that for? Keep your distance.

1313
01:01:47,125 --> 01:01:49,320
That's enough. I want you to leave.

1314
01:02:00,372 --> 01:02:02,033
You know, you're not bad.

1315
01:02:14,853 --> 01:02:16,184
It's you!

1316
01:02:17,255 --> 01:02:19,223
Fei Hong, hold him for me!

1317
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:22,724
Help.

1318
01:02:26,932 --> 01:02:28,365
Father, help!

1319
01:02:28,433 --> 01:02:30,196
- Help him!
- That's enough!

1320
01:02:30,268 --> 01:02:32,236
Hurting me!

1321
01:02:32,304 --> 01:02:34,169
Fei Hong, are you all right?

1322
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:35,797
Yeah, I was just pretending.

1323
01:02:35,874 --> 01:02:36,863
Fei Hong, who is that?

1324
01:02:43,949 --> 01:02:45,678
Fei Hong, hold it!

1325
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:47,650
We have you surrounded!

1326
01:02:47,719 --> 01:02:49,152
I'm talking to you.

1327
01:02:49,221 --> 01:02:50,984
Yeah. Would you stop?

1328
01:02:51,056 --> 01:02:52,489
Me?

1329
01:02:52,557 --> 01:02:53,785
Please, sir, I hope you can forgive us.

1330
01:02:53,859 --> 01:02:56,521
I am Wong Kei-Ying. I apologise.

1331
01:02:56,595 --> 01:02:59,393
You are very famous.
Meeting you is an honour.

1332
01:02:59,464 --> 01:03:01,762
I am Fu Wen-Chi.

1333
01:03:01,833 --> 01:03:03,698
Fu Wen-Chi?

1334
01:03:03,768 --> 01:03:05,463
Our most decorated Manchu officer.

1335
01:03:05,537 --> 01:03:07,300
Is it true?

1336
01:03:07,372 --> 01:03:08,964
Yes, it is.

1337
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:10,302
It's an honour. Welcome.

1338
01:03:10,375 --> 01:03:12,275
- Right this way.
- Thank you.

1339
01:03:12,344 --> 01:03:14,369
Good evening.

1340
01:03:14,446 --> 01:03:16,778
I guess that man is someone important.

1341
01:03:16,848 --> 01:03:18,782
Trust me, if he was important,

1342
01:03:18,850 --> 01:03:21,250
he wouldn't be hitting women, would he?

1343
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:23,878
Think about it.

1344
01:03:23,955 --> 01:03:24,887
What?

1345
01:03:24,956 --> 01:03:26,685
Keep searching. We have to find it.

1346
01:03:26,758 --> 01:03:27,918
Look in the parlour when you're done.

1347
01:03:27,993 --> 01:03:28,925
Yes, ma'am.

1348
01:03:28,994 --> 01:03:30,791
You have no idea where you left it?

1349
01:03:30,862 --> 01:03:33,160
No, I don't.

1350
01:03:33,231 --> 01:03:34,698
Where could it be?

1351
01:03:34,766 --> 01:03:36,427
Cho might know.

1352
01:03:39,538 --> 01:03:40,766
Something's wrong?

1353
01:03:40,839 --> 01:03:44,570
It's hot tonight. I can't stand it.

1354
01:03:44,643 --> 01:03:46,873
She's quite a handful.

1355
01:03:46,945 --> 01:03:50,039
Think I'll get some ice.

1356
01:03:50,115 --> 01:03:52,174
Cho, where's the jade box I had?

1357
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:53,274
What?

1358
01:03:53,351 --> 01:03:54,909
Where did you put it?

1359
01:03:54,986 --> 01:03:56,476
I don't know.

1360
01:03:56,555 --> 01:03:57,487
What is that?

1361
01:03:57,556 --> 01:03:59,319
Ground garlic.

1362
01:03:59,391 --> 01:04:01,382
I mean there in your hand.

1363
01:04:03,828 --> 01:04:05,523
We found it!

1364
01:04:05,597 --> 01:04:06,962
Fei Hong, where are you going?

1365
01:04:07,032 --> 01:04:08,829
I'm not finished with that.

1366
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:10,993
When you surprised
me in the baggage car,

1367
01:04:11,069 --> 01:04:12,730
I was trying to get back the jade seal

1368
01:04:12,804 --> 01:04:15,170
that Ambassador Morley had stolen.

1369
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:17,299
I wound up with your ginseng instead.

1370
01:04:17,375 --> 01:04:19,138
Tell me something,

1371
01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:21,508
there must be a hundred
jade seals in our museum.

1372
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:22,740
Is this one so special?

1373
01:04:22,814 --> 01:04:25,749
Fei Hong, they all are special.

1374
01:04:25,817 --> 01:04:27,512
Think about this.

1375
01:04:27,586 --> 01:04:29,611
Today they plunder a seal.

1376
01:04:29,688 --> 01:04:31,588
It seems small.

1377
01:04:31,656 --> 01:04:34,181
Tomorrow they take another,
and the next thing you know,

1378
01:04:34,259 --> 01:04:38,059
the Great Wall is gone. And what's next?

1379
01:04:38,129 --> 01:04:42,589
Our children must travel abroad
just to see their history.

1380
01:04:42,667 --> 01:04:45,830
So, don't you see that you and I

1381
01:04:45,904 --> 01:04:48,873
are the only possible defence

1382
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:51,932
from governments trying
to strip us of our culture?

1383
01:04:52,010 --> 01:04:53,307
So, I hope you can help me do this,

1384
01:04:53,378 --> 01:04:57,337
if only for the future
generations of our people.

1385
01:04:57,415 --> 01:05:00,976
All right. I'll be honoured to help.

1386
01:05:01,052 --> 01:05:02,713
Thank you, Fei Hong.

1387
01:05:05,123 --> 01:05:08,024
It's awfully quiet all of a sudden.

1388
01:05:08,093 --> 01:05:09,082
Where is everyone?

1389
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:10,889
Yeah. There's no one here.

1390
01:05:12,263 --> 01:05:13,628
I'll go take a look.

1391
01:05:26,177 --> 01:05:28,668
Let's go! Move!

1392
01:05:32,417 --> 01:05:34,214
What do we do?

1393
01:05:34,285 --> 01:05:35,582
Follow me.

1394
01:05:41,292 --> 01:05:42,554
Here I go!

1395
01:05:49,501 --> 01:05:50,695
Get him!

1396
01:06:32,777 --> 01:06:34,210
All right, lift it!

1397
01:06:41,152 --> 01:06:42,449
Here, Fei Hong!

1398
01:06:47,158 --> 01:06:48,313
Let's go!

1399
01:07:05,597 --> 01:07:07,758
They started.

1400
01:07:07,833 --> 01:07:09,733
I see the fun's begun.

1401
01:07:09,801 --> 01:07:11,428
Sounds great.

1402
01:07:11,503 --> 01:07:14,336
When you have the Ax Gang,
you're sure to get the job done.

1403
01:07:14,406 --> 01:07:16,101
That's what we're paying for.

1404
01:07:22,114 --> 01:07:24,708
Fei Hong, here!

1405
01:08:37,522 --> 01:08:42,016
Fei Hong! Your shirt, take it off!

1406
01:08:42,093 --> 01:08:43,583
Okay!

1407
01:09:30,375 --> 01:09:32,536
- Quickly, now, go!
- This way!

1408
01:09:32,611 --> 01:09:34,841
Go! Go! Move it!

1409
01:09:40,485 --> 01:09:41,645
Run! Go on!

1410
01:09:48,894 --> 01:09:52,057
What's this? What's going on?

1411
01:09:52,130 --> 01:09:53,256
Don't get involved.

1412
01:09:54,966 --> 01:09:56,228
Get on out of here.

1413
01:09:56,301 --> 01:09:57,598
Now. Go on.

1414
01:09:57,669 --> 01:09:58,601
Help.

1415
01:09:58,670 --> 01:10:00,103
That's Fu Wen-Chi!

1416
01:10:08,747 --> 01:10:10,271
That hurt!

1417
01:10:19,424 --> 01:10:20,448
Fu Wen-Chi!

1418
01:10:21,626 --> 01:10:22,650
- There!
- Master Fu!

1419
01:10:22,727 --> 01:10:25,161
Come on! Let's go!

1420
01:10:27,198 --> 01:10:28,130
Master Fu!

1421
01:10:28,199 --> 01:10:31,498
- Get behind!
- Help!

1422
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:37,107
Try to stop the bleeding.

1423
01:10:37,175 --> 01:10:38,369
Don't die!

1424
01:10:38,443 --> 01:10:39,933
Hold on! Master Fu!

1425
01:10:40,011 --> 01:10:41,808
We'll go for a doctor!
You'll be all right!

1426
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:43,541
The royal seal...

1427
01:10:43,615 --> 01:10:45,048
I know. We'll get it.

1428
01:10:45,116 --> 01:10:46,242
Don't worry. I'll find it.

1429
01:10:46,318 --> 01:10:49,253
The embassy. Go quickly.

1430
01:10:49,321 --> 01:10:50,754
- What do I do?
- Tonight.

1431
01:10:50,822 --> 01:10:53,757
Hold on, Master. My father
will take care of you.

1432
01:10:53,825 --> 01:10:56,385
I promise. Don't give up!

1433
01:10:57,963 --> 01:11:00,454
No, Master Fu! Come on!

1434
01:11:03,868 --> 01:11:07,360
What are you thinking?

1435
01:11:07,439 --> 01:11:09,304
Nothing!

1436
01:11:37,769 --> 01:11:39,669
May I give you a light?

1437
01:11:39,738 --> 01:11:43,572
Hold this, please. Thanks very much.

1438
01:11:43,642 --> 01:11:45,667
There you are.

1439
01:11:52,651 --> 01:11:54,585
Carry on.

1440
01:12:05,497 --> 01:12:07,260
Pick it up. What's wrong with you?

1441
01:12:27,619 --> 01:12:29,052
- Chang Tsan?
- Fei Hong?

1442
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:31,645
Come on! You almost killed me!

1443
01:12:31,723 --> 01:12:33,486
What are you doing here?

1444
01:12:33,558 --> 01:12:34,650
Me? What are you doing here? Come on.

1445
01:12:37,729 --> 01:12:38,753
I got him.

1446
01:12:40,365 --> 01:12:41,764
So, where's the seal?

1447
01:12:41,833 --> 01:12:43,130
How should I know? Let's go.

1448
01:12:43,201 --> 01:12:45,135
Here.

1449
01:12:45,203 --> 01:12:46,602
Thanks.

1450
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,701
Anybody see you?

1451
01:12:50,775 --> 01:12:53,608
No. I can't see. You got a light?

1452
01:12:53,678 --> 01:12:56,146
Of course. Hold it.

1453
01:13:01,886 --> 01:13:03,319
Down.

1454
01:13:29,447 --> 01:13:31,540
Looking for something?

1455
01:13:33,885 --> 01:13:35,978
Is this what brought you here?

1456
01:13:36,054 --> 01:13:38,284
Kneel!

1457
01:13:38,356 --> 01:13:40,017
I hope you don't mind.

1458
01:13:40,091 --> 01:13:43,117
We've taken the liberty
to document your stay

1459
01:13:43,194 --> 01:13:46,027
at our magnificent embassy.

1460
01:13:46,097 --> 01:13:47,462
Please do enjoy our hospitality.

1461
01:13:47,532 --> 01:13:49,898
You can go straight to hell!

1462
01:14:04,916 --> 01:14:06,213
That's enough! Over!

1463
01:14:06,284 --> 01:14:07,842
A winner.

1464
01:14:07,919 --> 01:14:10,149
That'll be all, gentlemen.

1465
01:14:10,221 --> 01:14:12,052
We'll continue the plan as scheduled.

1466
01:14:12,123 --> 01:14:13,181
Yes, sir.

1467
01:14:13,258 --> 01:14:14,782
Thank you.

1468
01:14:19,931 --> 01:14:21,865
Things have worked out rather well

1469
01:14:21,933 --> 01:14:23,764
now that we have the jade seal back

1470
01:14:23,835 --> 01:14:26,633
and a way to acquire Po Chi Lam.

1471
01:14:26,704 --> 01:14:28,797
That's right. I've already sent

1472
01:14:28,873 --> 01:14:31,501
the embassy photographs
of Fei Hong and his friend

1473
01:14:31,576 --> 01:14:34,067
to Master Wong.

1474
01:14:34,145 --> 01:14:36,477
He'll sell just like I told you.

1475
01:14:36,548 --> 01:14:37,606
He has no choice.

1476
01:14:37,682 --> 01:14:40,344
Make sure he understands, John,

1477
01:14:40,418 --> 01:14:43,012
that we expect him to vacate
the Po Chi Lam immediately,

1478
01:14:43,087 --> 01:14:45,740
or we'll plan to execute Fei Hong.

1479
01:14:47,142 --> 01:14:48,734
Damn those boys!

1480
01:14:48,810 --> 01:14:51,040
Don't they understand
there's nothing we can do?

1481
01:14:51,112 --> 01:14:53,740
As an embassy, they're
exempt from the laws of China.

1482
01:14:53,815 --> 01:14:55,680
Maybe we can reason with them. I'll go.

1483
01:14:55,750 --> 01:14:58,184
Sit down! You know what they want-

1484
01:14:58,253 --> 01:15:00,551
the rights to Po Chi Lam!

1485
01:15:00,622 --> 01:15:02,487
They just wanted to return the seal.

1486
01:15:02,557 --> 01:15:03,888
They aren't the criminals.

1487
01:15:03,958 --> 01:15:05,448
- You spoiled him!
- You disowned him!

1488
01:15:05,527 --> 01:15:07,461
This is all your fault!

1489
01:15:07,529 --> 01:15:09,258
You're impossible.

1490
01:15:09,330 --> 01:15:11,230
And you're his father.

1491
01:15:11,299 --> 01:15:13,961
We're running out of time.
We've got to do something.

1492
01:15:14,035 --> 01:15:14,967
You're right.

1493
01:15:15,036 --> 01:15:17,129
I refuse.

1494
01:15:17,205 --> 01:15:18,638
How can I?

1495
01:15:18,706 --> 01:15:21,698
You know this land has been
in our family for centuries.

1496
01:15:21,776 --> 01:15:24,142
There has always been a school here.

1497
01:15:24,212 --> 01:15:26,908
What would you do, just give it up?

1498
01:15:26,981 --> 01:15:29,415
I'll never do it.

1499
01:15:29,484 --> 01:15:31,418
Really? What would
his mother have done?

1500
01:15:31,486 --> 01:15:32,817
I bet I know!

1501
01:15:36,558 --> 01:15:40,688
Sister, I need your wisdom

1502
01:15:40,762 --> 01:15:43,162
more than ever.

1503
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:45,529
What can we do for Fei Hong?

1504
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:48,034
Can you help us?

1505
01:15:58,446 --> 01:15:59,378
Release them.

1506
01:15:59,447 --> 01:16:01,381
You may let them go.

1507
01:16:11,659 --> 01:16:13,559
You okay?

1508
01:16:13,628 --> 01:16:16,358
Just go on.

1509
01:16:16,431 --> 01:16:18,126
Tsan.

1510
01:16:18,199 --> 01:16:19,131
I'm grateful.

1511
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:22,135
Are you hurt? okay.

1512
01:16:23,238 --> 01:16:24,899
Just look at you.

1513
01:16:24,973 --> 01:16:27,965
I'm gonna be all right.

1514
01:16:28,042 --> 01:16:29,509
Madam Wong.

1515
01:16:29,577 --> 01:16:31,169
Are you okay, Master?

1516
01:16:31,246 --> 01:16:33,043
Some bruises, but I'll be fine.

1517
01:16:33,114 --> 01:16:34,638
So, what will we do now?

1518
01:16:34,716 --> 01:16:35,910
What do you mean?

1519
01:16:35,984 --> 01:16:38,248
Master Wong has sold the
school to the embassy.

1520
01:16:38,319 --> 01:16:40,184
He did what?!

1521
01:16:40,255 --> 01:16:41,244
How could that be?

1522
01:16:41,322 --> 01:16:43,517
Don't you see? They made him sell it.

1523
01:16:43,591 --> 01:16:45,525
He had to or they would kill you both.

1524
01:16:45,593 --> 01:16:47,959
You're just lucky to be alive.

1525
01:16:48,029 --> 01:16:51,692
Fei Hong, this fight is over.

1526
01:16:51,766 --> 01:16:53,825
We can't do this anymore.

1527
01:16:53,902 --> 01:16:55,563
I hope you know your father
has sacrificed everything.

1528
01:16:55,637 --> 01:16:59,403
I wish that they had killed me.

1529
01:16:59,474 --> 01:17:02,534
Now, Fei Hong, that is enough.

1530
01:17:02,610 --> 01:17:05,636
Life's changes are like a moving river.

1531
01:17:05,713 --> 01:17:08,443
What's here today is gone tomorrow

1532
01:17:08,516 --> 01:17:10,780
and tomorrow brings a whole new journey.

1533
01:17:10,852 --> 01:17:12,979
Let's move forward and live.

1534
01:17:17,992 --> 01:17:21,894
So, when will the ship be leaving?

1535
01:17:21,963 --> 01:17:23,089
This Tuesday.

1536
01:17:23,164 --> 01:17:25,428
And everything's ready?

1537
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:27,525
Yes, sir. Ready and waiting, sir.

1538
01:17:27,602 --> 01:17:28,796
Good, good.

1539
01:17:28,870 --> 01:17:31,395
I want to close down the
factory, lay off the workers,

1540
01:17:31,472 --> 01:17:33,406
and transport the shipment to Hong Kong.

1541
01:17:33,474 --> 01:17:34,907
Pick it up.

1542
01:17:34,976 --> 01:17:36,739
Yes, sir.

1543
01:17:41,683 --> 01:17:43,981
First we work overtime!

1544
01:17:44,052 --> 01:17:46,213
We refuse, then they beat us!

1545
01:17:46,287 --> 01:17:48,187
And now they think
they can fire all of us

1546
01:17:48,256 --> 01:17:49,450
just like that!

1547
01:17:49,524 --> 01:17:52,755
So, are you guys going to
let him get away with that?

1548
01:17:52,827 --> 01:17:54,590
What do you say?

1549
01:17:54,662 --> 01:17:57,028
Chang Tsan, what's going on?

1550
01:17:57,098 --> 01:17:59,259
They closed the mill, and you know what?

1551
01:17:59,334 --> 01:18:00,767
It was English ambassador

1552
01:18:00,835 --> 01:18:03,702
who was in charge of doing it.

1553
01:18:03,771 --> 01:18:06,035
Sounds like trouble. I
don't think I can help you.

1554
01:18:06,107 --> 01:18:08,837
Sure. You didn't lose your job.

1555
01:18:08,910 --> 01:18:11,003
Well, I'm not gonna
let them push us around.

1556
01:18:11,079 --> 01:18:12,546
Yeah. As soon as they
finished the last shipment,

1557
01:18:12,613 --> 01:18:14,103
they fired all the men.

1558
01:18:14,182 --> 01:18:17,151
And you think they have
something to do with it?

1559
01:18:17,218 --> 01:18:19,686
I don't know, but I'm
going to find out for sure.

1560
01:18:19,754 --> 01:18:21,585
Let me think what it could be.

1561
01:18:21,656 --> 01:18:23,419
We should check the office.

1562
01:18:23,491 --> 01:18:26,858
Fei Hong, could that be it?

1563
01:18:26,928 --> 01:18:28,793
Well, we know they're up to something.

1564
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:31,127
Find a way into the factory.

1565
01:18:31,199 --> 01:18:32,723
Then we'll find a way to stop them.

1566
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:34,597
Let's go.

1567
01:18:47,382 --> 01:18:49,145
What's this?

1568
01:18:49,217 --> 01:18:52,448
Look what they're doing!

1569
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:54,920
Well, we've got to stop them.

1570
01:18:54,989 --> 01:18:56,081
I'll tell Fei Hong.

1571
01:18:56,157 --> 01:18:57,089
Hurry, Ho Sang!

1572
01:18:58,159 --> 01:19:00,024
In a hurry?

1573
01:19:00,094 --> 01:19:01,186
Sorry.

1574
01:19:04,232 --> 01:19:05,893
Let go!

1575
01:19:28,656 --> 01:19:30,624
Go get help!

1576
01:19:36,531 --> 01:19:38,226
Ho Sang, this way!

1577
01:19:38,299 --> 01:19:40,062
No. I've got to tell Fei Hong.

1578
01:19:41,903 --> 01:19:44,133
Get out of here!

1579
01:19:44,205 --> 01:19:45,194
Get them!

1580
01:19:49,143 --> 01:19:50,303
Bring Fei Hong!

1581
01:19:51,512 --> 01:19:52,444
Go now!

1582
01:20:11,933 --> 01:20:14,800
Madam, they're coming out.

1583
01:20:14,869 --> 01:20:17,463
All right, keep it down.

1584
01:20:17,538 --> 01:20:18,971
Then we can organise.

1585
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:20,974
A good idea. Good day.

1586
01:20:21,042 --> 01:20:22,236
Goodbye. Have a safe trip.

1587
01:20:22,310 --> 01:20:23,777
Take care of the baby.

1588
01:20:23,845 --> 01:20:25,938
I will.

1589
01:20:26,013 --> 01:20:28,538
Fei Hong?

1590
01:20:28,616 --> 01:20:29,583
Yes, Father?

1591
01:20:29,650 --> 01:20:31,208
Don't get up. Keep working.

1592
01:20:31,285 --> 01:20:32,547
Are you almost through with that?

1593
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:34,451
Almost finished.

1594
01:20:34,522 --> 01:20:36,490
Then start another one.

1595
01:20:36,557 --> 01:20:39,082
I'll make sure he does.
It's my responsibility.

1596
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:40,923
He's not allowed to
leave. You understand me?

1597
01:20:40,995 --> 01:20:42,360
Perfectly.

1598
01:20:42,430 --> 01:20:43,761
All right. Good.

1599
01:20:45,299 --> 01:20:46,459
You know, dear,

1600
01:20:46,534 --> 01:20:48,661
I've been thinking
about names for the baby.

1601
01:20:48,736 --> 01:20:51,796
If we were to have a boy,
he could be Wong Tei-Pau.

1602
01:20:51,873 --> 01:20:53,841
If it's a girl, Wong Pei.

1603
01:20:53,908 --> 01:20:55,432
Nice. Both names are fine.

1604
01:20:55,510 --> 01:20:57,637
But do we really need to pick one now?

1605
01:20:57,712 --> 01:20:58,644
What if I'm early?

1606
01:20:58,713 --> 01:21:00,044
That shouldn't be a problem

1607
01:21:00,114 --> 01:21:01,706
if you take it easy till I get back.

1608
01:21:01,782 --> 01:21:02,646
Of course.

1609
01:21:02,717 --> 01:21:04,685
- Fei Hong?
- Yes?

1610
01:21:04,752 --> 01:21:05,719
Water the plants.

1611
01:21:05,786 --> 01:21:07,219
I will!

1612
01:21:07,288 --> 01:21:09,518
Hold on! I've got to go.

1613
01:21:09,590 --> 01:21:11,387
Remember, get lots of rest.

1614
01:21:11,459 --> 01:21:13,222
We'll be fine. Don't worry.

1615
01:21:13,294 --> 01:21:14,318
Fei Hong and I will be just fine.

1616
01:21:14,395 --> 01:21:16,761
Go! We don't have any time to spare!

1617
01:21:16,831 --> 01:21:18,594
Hurry!

1618
01:21:21,202 --> 01:21:23,693
We've got to get Chin out of there.

1619
01:21:23,771 --> 01:21:25,432
I hope he's still alive.

1620
01:21:25,506 --> 01:21:26,939
What can we do?

1621
01:21:27,008 --> 01:21:28,942
I'm going to stop them.
I'm going to do what I can!

1622
01:21:29,010 --> 01:21:31,672
I gave my promise to Fu and Chin!

1623
01:21:31,746 --> 01:21:34,044
What do you think?

1624
01:21:34,115 --> 01:21:35,047
Let's go.

1625
01:21:35,116 --> 01:21:37,846
Wait, where are you going?

1626
01:21:37,919 --> 01:21:38,908
I'm going to battle!

1627
01:21:38,986 --> 01:21:40,010
But...

1628
01:21:40,087 --> 01:21:41,884
Wait, madam, you can't
go in your condition.

1629
01:21:41,956 --> 01:21:45,517
What condition? Come
on, I'm only pregnant.

1630
01:21:45,593 --> 01:21:49,029
Madam, please. Think about the baby.

1631
01:21:49,096 --> 01:21:51,860
What if something were to happen?

1632
01:21:51,933 --> 01:21:53,764
You're right. Go ahead without me, then.

1633
01:21:53,834 --> 01:21:56,428
I'll go get my students.
Meet me at the mill.

1634
01:21:56,504 --> 01:21:58,335
Right. I'll gather up the men.

1635
01:21:58,406 --> 01:22:00,499
Thanks, Fei Hong.

1636
01:22:00,575 --> 01:22:04,033
You're with us, right? Yeah, okay.

1637
01:22:04,111 --> 01:22:05,669
Will you be all right, madam?

1638
01:22:05,746 --> 01:22:07,373
- I'll be fine.
- Good.

1639
01:22:07,448 --> 01:22:08,915
But what if Father finds out?

1640
01:22:08,983 --> 01:22:11,315
Go on. Who cares now
what your father thinks?

1641
01:22:11,385 --> 01:22:12,750
Only make me proud.

1642
01:22:12,820 --> 01:22:14,754
I will. okay.

1643
01:22:17,158 --> 01:22:19,558
Something for good luck.

1644
01:22:22,096 --> 01:22:23,586
I can use it.

1645
01:22:25,967 --> 01:22:29,403
We demand justice!

1646
01:22:29,470 --> 01:22:33,429
We demand justice!

1647
01:22:34,942 --> 01:22:37,172
Get back!

1648
01:23:02,619 --> 01:23:04,109
You step aside now!

1649
01:23:04,187 --> 01:23:06,451
We demand justice! We know
what you have in there!

1650
01:23:06,523 --> 01:23:07,990
Back off!

1651
01:23:08,058 --> 01:23:09,116
Those antiques are not yours,

1652
01:23:09,192 --> 01:23:10,124
and we won't let them out of China!

1653
01:23:10,193 --> 01:23:11,683
You have no right to them.

1654
01:23:11,762 --> 01:23:13,889
Is that right?

1655
01:23:19,836 --> 01:23:21,167
Charge!

1656
01:23:28,278 --> 01:23:30,212
No! No guns!

1657
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:32,407
Kill them all!

1658
01:23:53,003 --> 01:23:57,702
Fei Hong, you've got to rescue jade now.

1659
01:24:05,182 --> 01:24:07,673
- Get back!
- Stand back!

1660
01:24:30,941 --> 01:24:33,569
Come on!

1661
01:24:33,643 --> 01:24:35,702
Wait!

1662
01:24:45,822 --> 01:24:47,312
Come on!

1663
01:24:58,468 --> 01:24:59,730
One hand!

1664
01:26:24,254 --> 01:26:26,779
Here's water!

1665
01:26:26,856 --> 01:26:28,255
Thanks.

1666
01:26:35,065 --> 01:26:37,260
Wait!

1667
01:26:37,334 --> 01:26:38,266
You gotta find jade.

1668
01:26:38,335 --> 01:26:39,597
Let's go!

1669
01:26:39,669 --> 01:26:42,365
Yeah. Let's go.

1670
01:26:42,439 --> 01:26:46,000
Boss!

1671
01:26:49,946 --> 01:26:51,379
What happened?

1672
01:26:51,448 --> 01:26:54,246
That drunken guy is here!
We got to do something!

1673
01:26:54,317 --> 01:26:56,148
All right, get him!

1674
01:27:08,098 --> 01:27:09,190
Won't this be fun.

1675
01:27:14,304 --> 01:27:16,067
Wait!

1676
01:27:16,139 --> 01:27:18,369
Do you realise what you're doing?

1677
01:27:18,441 --> 01:27:21,035
You're helping them steal
our history, our culture.

1678
01:27:22,412 --> 01:27:24,471
You mean these?

1679
01:27:24,547 --> 01:27:26,071
They're of no use to anyone.

1680
01:27:26,149 --> 01:27:28,208
If they want to buy
them, I'll gladly sell.

1681
01:27:28,284 --> 01:27:29,308
I won't let you do it.

1682
01:27:29,386 --> 01:27:32,378
And what are you gonna do about it?

1683
01:27:32,455 --> 01:27:35,618
Listen here, nothing's
gonna stand in my way,

1684
01:27:35,692 --> 01:27:37,887
so why don't you just go home to Daddy?

1685
01:27:37,961 --> 01:27:39,451
I've heard enough.

1686
01:27:39,529 --> 01:27:41,827
Well, that makes two of us.

1687
01:27:41,898 --> 01:27:42,865
Henry?

1688
01:27:42,932 --> 01:27:46,231
Don't waste time. Just get it over with.

1689
01:27:46,302 --> 01:27:47,200
Do it.

1690
01:27:48,672 --> 01:27:49,764
You hear me?

1691
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:24,372
Sorry.

1692
01:28:58,475 --> 01:29:00,375
Do something.

1693
01:29:28,138 --> 01:29:31,130
Catch!

1694
01:29:36,713 --> 01:29:40,342
What are you gonna do now?

1695
01:29:46,856 --> 01:29:47,982
Help him!

1696
01:31:29,914 --> 01:31:32,348
Drunken boxing?

1697
01:31:33,451 --> 01:31:34,816
Well, what do you say?

1698
01:31:38,056 --> 01:31:38,988
Come on!

1699
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:04,539
You okay?

1700
01:33:03,007 --> 01:33:05,669
Now it's over!

1701
01:33:18,523 --> 01:33:20,047
Give me another rod!

1702
01:33:20,124 --> 01:33:21,648
What's this?

1703
01:33:21,726 --> 01:33:24,490
"A boat can float in
water, but also sink in it"?

1704
01:33:24,562 --> 01:33:26,996
A bit of Daddy's wisdom.

1705
01:33:30,268 --> 01:33:32,759
Here, finish him off!

1706
01:33:34,572 --> 01:33:35,596
All right, this is it!

1707
01:35:23,448 --> 01:35:25,245
Just perfect!

1708
01:35:27,385 --> 01:35:28,579
How about it?

1709
01:38:58,563 --> 01:39:00,724
On behalf of the governor,
I want to thank Fei Hong

1710
01:39:00,798 --> 01:39:02,698
for his role in returning
the stolen antiquities

1711
01:39:02,767 --> 01:39:04,826
and on the arrest of the ambassador.

1712
01:39:04,902 --> 01:39:05,834
Thank you, sir.

1713
01:39:05,903 --> 01:39:06,892
None of this could have happened

1714
01:39:06,971 --> 01:39:08,370
without the support
of his loving father.

1715
01:39:08,439 --> 01:39:10,873
Well, we need more fathers

1716
01:39:10,942 --> 01:39:12,910
who treat their sons like that.

1717
01:39:12,977 --> 01:39:16,344
You should be very proud of him.

1718
01:39:16,414 --> 01:39:17,574
So, where is he?

1719
01:39:17,648 --> 01:39:20,776
Fei Hong is still feeling
some of the after-effects

1720
01:39:20,852 --> 01:39:22,513
of all that he's been through.

1721
01:39:22,587 --> 01:39:23,986
We hope he'll soon be on his feet.

1722
01:39:24,055 --> 01:39:28,048
I'm sure that he will come
see you as soon as he can.

1723
01:39:28,125 --> 01:39:30,093
And he better. I've
got a job for that boy.

1724
01:39:30,161 --> 01:39:32,493
I am certain he will be most pleased.

1725
01:39:32,563 --> 01:39:35,657
Smile! Count to 3! 1... 2...
