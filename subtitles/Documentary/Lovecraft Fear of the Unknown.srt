00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:30,234
I will see you later

2
00:02:31,402 --> 00:02:34,864
Look at a person when you greet them

3
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:36,532
And you call yourself a man?

4
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,492
Why, you brat!

5
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,624
Mom, do you have some money?

6
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,417
I'm supposed to go to
the movies with a friend...

7
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:32,504
Damn. I just Wanna see
a movie, dammit.

8
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,895
HEY, hey, Chang-Guk!

9
00:04:58,465 --> 00:04:59,675

10
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,805
I Want playboy, you got it?

11
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:47,973

12
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,186
9 dollar, 9 dollar

13
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:12,373
Why are you so late!

14
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:48,075
What are you doing?

15
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:17,062
Looks about 30 pounds, 30
Load it up

16
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,489
Oh, give me one more!

17
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:30,617
After I bone it. It'll only be 20 pounds
I'm being generous, as it is

18
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:33,912
Move your ass over

19
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:07,279
Pull! Pull it you dumb-ass!

20
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:11,783

00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:40,270
Light the burner and bring it in!

24
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:58,765
Enjoy your stew!

25
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:01,393
Oh, you're here?

26
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:04,730

27
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:06,732
What do you mean, how much?

28
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:07,733
Okay

29

Look! It does mean pleasure

30
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:33,425
Hey, then look up this one

31
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:36,845
0.r.g.a.i.z.e

32
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,747
What are you doing?
Squeeze some more yellow paint

33
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:37,572
It got returned again

34
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:40,701
It's not like you've sent one or two
Why not stop sending them now?

35
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:23,785
Welcome

36
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:36,423
Where are the canned mackerels?

37
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:41,344
What?

38
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,221
Canned mackerels... where are they?

39
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:46,433
There aren't any!
Not for sale!

40
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:48,560
Why not?

41
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:51,688
This is Korea! Speak in Korean!

42
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:55,692
I'll be in the U.S. soon enough!

43
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:57,027
Where are they?
Hurry up and give it!

44
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:58,820
Get out!
I won't sell to you!

45
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:03,742
Get out! Get out! Not for sale!
Get out already!

46
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:06,119
You pushing me?

47
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:10,165
Don't you be twisting your tongue around here!
You gonna get out?

48
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:17,380
You bitch!

49
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:29,601
Of all the rotten... rotten luck!

50
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:40,463
Bastard...

51
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:43,300
You weren' t like this
when you were a boy

52
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:46,177
You learned English Well...

53
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:47,971
listened to your mom...

54
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,389
Shut up, you whore!

55
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,185
Before I stomp you to death!

56
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:05,071
Told you to stop this craziness!

57
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,409
Damn bastard!

58
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:15,290
I was wrong! Stop it!
Please stop! Chang-Guk!

59
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:29,531
He hit you again?

60
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,117
The rotten bastard!

61
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,537
Don't you call my son a bastard!

62
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,039
You're probably the only woman
who gets beat up by her brat...

63
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:40,959
I told you I'd make sure it
never happened again!

64
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:42,961
You hit my son
and I'll kill you!

65
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:47,966
Let me see...

66
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,262
Dammit!

67
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,930
You, you wanna become like me, too?

68
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:44,314
[Ma.
an]!

69
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:47,442
Here's your monthly pension
Please give me your stamp

70
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:53,823
You' re lucky to have
such an honorable father...

71
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:57,577
Did your father die
in the Baekma-Goji Battle?

72
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:00,747
Doesn't that bother you?

73
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:04,375
Your brother shot you
with a toy gun, right?

74
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,796
Let me see
Let' s see how bad it is

75
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:15,095
It's not enough to take my eye
you gotta cripple my dog, too?

76
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:17,514
Why do you leave it anywhere?

77
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:20,558
And! Why is your eye my fault?

78
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,352
We were both playing!

79
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:23,770
Who said to move?

80
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:26,314
And you can still see
fine out of one eye!

81
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:28,316
You two fight all the time!

82
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:29,526
Dammit

83
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,739
Where did your husband die?

84
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:35,949
At the Fight of Nakdong River?

85
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,450
Many died there too...

86
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:39,828
I don' t know
They' cl have to find the body first!

87
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:42,330
Whew! What are you going to do
about your daughter's eye?

88
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:44,874
They could fix it
at the American Military Hospital...

89
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,835
If you're finished, leave!

90
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:49,754
I feel bad for your daughter that' s all.
She has her whole life ahead of her...

91
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:12,360
Whenever I hold an arrow
I remember the War

92
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:25,707
At the Battle of Nakdong River
We fought with a North squadron

93
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,293
I shot three of them dead!

94
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:31,713
So why didn't you get a medal?

95
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,756
Exactly

96
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:37,093
That's why the government's
screwed up!

97
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:42,557
They don't give to them who deserve it. But
them cowards at the rear they get one!

98
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:43,850
Take a look at this!

99
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,437
For this service all

100
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:49,105
I get is a measly
30 dollars a month

101
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:54,027
That' s disgusting!
Pull it down, quick!

102
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:58,239
What' s wrong?
This is as good as a medal...

103
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:00,742
Fuck!
You think anyone gets a medal?

104
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,370
Arrogant asshole!

105
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:07,832
You who come from licking
Yankee asses...

106
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,585
Still, I've never killed anyone!

107
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:14,964
Whenever you open
your mouth it's the War

108
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:18,092
Are you so proud of killing
three men of our same blood? Tell me!

109
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:19,844
Sergeant Kim!

110
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:22,931
Are you so proud of shooting
three men dead?

111
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:27,560
Bastard, don't even know who's
on top and who's at the bottom!

112
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:30,104
That's why you always
have dog blood on your hands!

113
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:36,110
Sure! Let's see
if you don't sell your mutt to me!

114
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:39,697
Care to lay some money down?

115
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:42,325
Who's betting at this
sacred archery field?

116
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:44,744
You're talking shit!

117
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:48,122
In the old clays, a butcher like you
wouldn't be allowed to shoot arrows!

118
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:51,542
Only wealthy farmers could!

119
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:52,835
Times have gotten better...

120
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:55,922
even a meat-hacking bastard
gets to shoot arrows...

121
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:57,966
God-dammit! A meat-hacker!

122
00:20:58,007 --> 00:20:59,509
You clone talking?

123
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:01,344
You guys have to fight
every time you meet?

124
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:02,762
That's enough, people

125
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:04,555
You want to see me grab
a dog right now?

126
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:07,392
Patience, got to be patient

127
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,185
Just let him be

128
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:13,106
He's asking for it! Shit!
All he's got is that dingy pride of his

129
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:15,733
You gonna play a game?

130
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:18,403
You go first!

131
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:58,609
Really?

132
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:00,903
Yes

133
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:04,949
Will you be quiet!

134
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:08,995
What are you doing undressed?
Crazy bitch!

135
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:48,451
Mom! Did you see my puppy?

136
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:49,535
Don't know!

137
00:22:58,252 --> 00:22:59,212
Hey, Jihum

138
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,718
About this big... its fur is white

139
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,637
with some black mixed in...

140
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:11,349
Little shmucks, at it already!

141
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:13,226
Go home now!

142
00:23:31,786 --> 00:23:32,537
Anyone here?

143
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:33,538
Welcome

144
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,748
We're hereto sell this dog
We found it on the street

145
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,625
I don't need such young...

146
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,460
I don't take puppies

147
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:40,628
Take it away

148
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:45,341
Students

149
00:23:49,137 --> 00:23:53,474
Shit! Even if it's a puppy it's still dog meat
why won't she buy it?

150
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:56,269
Let's kill it ourselves
and then sell it

151
00:23:57,395 --> 00:23:58,729
Then she won't know it's a puppy!

152
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:01,441
Get over here!

153
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:03,776
Get over here!

154
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:15,580
What... dammit!

155
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:21,455
Who said to look at girls?

156
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:23,416
It's because of guys like you
we soldiers get a bum wrap!

157
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:26,877
That's right, asshole! I can't get used to it
here I think I'll go crazy Without a woman!

158
00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:28,713
Yeah
I got a problem with that

159
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:30,006
There is a problem

160
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:32,925
You think I Want to be here?
I'm doing my part for World peace

161
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:34,343
World peace?

162
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:36,387
Who thinks like that?

163
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:38,639
Probably just us Americans

164
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:45,980

If you don't come
I'll kill you

166
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:50,901
Do you like coke?

167
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:53,547
Hey, you do it!

168
00:27:56,217 --> 00:27:58,552
You click!

169
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:01,472
You think I like doing this?

170
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:05,351
Why'd you hit
my girlfriend yesterday?

171
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:10,523
That bastard! Hey!

172
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:17,863
Don't you run!

173
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:23,577
Asshole! See if you don't come back!

174
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:33,879
What are you doing?
Get back to Work, now!

175
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:44,932
What the hell? Get out of here!

176
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:48,018
Get out of here!
Get back to Work, now!

177
00:29:07,288 --> 00:29:08,122
Get out of here!

178
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:10,416
Get out of here! Bastard

179
00:29:16,756 --> 00:29:17,840
I won't use the likes of you!

180
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:03,719
Hey, that's enough!

181
00:30:07,223 --> 00:30:08,432
You're going to hurt the meat!

182
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:10,559
Come here!

183
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:20,027
Stupid moron, that's the way
you should have done it!

184
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,570
Then I wouldn't have hit you so much!
Here, have a swig

185
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:23,531
Here, have a swig

186
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:35,709
To be a dog dealer
you gotta outstare them!

187
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:39,505
When a dog looks straight at you
it's scary, right?

188
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:42,675
You know What the scariest
eyeball of them all is?

189
00:30:43,634 --> 00:30:45,010
It's the human eye

190
00:30:48,973 --> 00:30:50,933
You know why the dogs
look away from me?

191
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:54,603
Because there's fire in my eyes

192
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:55,980
Here look!

193
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:01,944
Hey, you Want to go to your
father's land, don't you?

00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:10,911
Answer in English...

195
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:16,876
You bastard, your mother taught you English
by beating it into you, didn't she?

196
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,508
To speak good English
no good thing

197
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:27,845
You gotta do everything those
Yankees tell you to, everything

198
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,054
Everything!

199
00:31:31,974 --> 00:31:35,227
You hit my girlfriend one more time

200
00:31:36,604 --> 00:31:40,316
She's your mom but
she's my girlfriend!

201
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:41,734
From before you were born!

202
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:49,909
Look at me like Dog-Eye!

203
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:58,208
Stop looking at me!
My eye's about to explode!

204
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:41,210
Hey

205
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:44,046

206
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:55,140
You hear what I'm saying?

207
00:32:58,185 --> 00:33:01,397
If I Went to school
I'd be two grades ahead of you

208
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:05,150
But you don't, moron!
What do you know better than us?

209
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:08,362

210
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:13,534
You want to go to school, too, huh?

211
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:16,620
He asked if you wanted
to go to school!

212
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,665
What's your dream?

213
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:22,835
What do you want to be in the future?

214
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:28,090
This is for being so dumb, got it?

215
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:28,757
Answer!

216
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:31,218
Got it?

217
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:31,927

00:34:29,068 --> 00:34:29,902
What's this?

228
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:40,245
Have you ever seen
a naked girl in person?

229
00:34:48,504 --> 00:34:50,964
This is boring!

230
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:54,551
She's not undressing!

00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,420
How could she poke me
with a pencil? Oh, it hurts

235
00:36:11,545 --> 00:36:12,838
Does it hurt a lot?

239
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,719

240
00:37:02,638 --> 00:37:05,182
You saw what the puppy did...

241
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:12,481
I felt weird

242
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:18,445

244
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:35,457

Shoot it!

246
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:44,925

Shoot it! Let see you!

247
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:23,630

Can you pull your hair back once?

254
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:54,619
I'm not making fun of you

255
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:58,707
I just want to see if it can be fixed
Pull your hair back

256
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:27,027
Why did you run?

257
00:41:27,152 --> 00:41:28,862
Who ran away?
I needed to take a leak!

258
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:31,656
You think We American soldiers are dogs, sir?
To take a leak anywhere?

259
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:34,242
Something's fishy here
I exercise the right to inspect your things

260
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:35,952
Inspect? What did I do?

261
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:38,955
We're on alert these days because of drugs
Please cooperate

262
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:40,540
Drugs? Sure. Go ahead

I'm sorry

264
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:44,503
How old are you?

265
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:45,921

266
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:47,380

Eighteen is still
underage in Korea!

271
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:59,392
Don't soil the honor of the world's greatest
American army

272
00:41:59,476 --> 00:42:01,311
What the hell?

273
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:04,147

He's at least 40 pounds
Try weighing him again

282
00:44:23,036 --> 00:44:25,580
Forget it! You should be thankful

298
00:49:57,245 --> 00:49:58,204

No trouble, okay?

310
00:52:59,552 --> 00:53:00,428
Hey!

313
00:53:33,586 --> 00:53:34,503
How'd you like it?

Hey!

What's the matter?

320
00:54:21,259 --> 00:54:23,052
You think I don't know
What you are?

321
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:25,096
Pretend to be nice and
then eat her up!

322
00:54:25,554 --> 00:54:28,516
I served three years
at Camp Carol

326
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:54,500
By any chance, have you heard
from Mr. Wonil Jang?

327
00:54:54,583 --> 00:54:56,585
How can I hear from
a dead person?

328
00:54:56,669 --> 00:55:01,716
You see... actually they say
Wonil Jang didn't die in the war

329
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:03,301
that he's alive in North Korea

330
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:07,096
It's been confirmed that Wonil Jang
voluntarily went to the North..

331
00:55:07,221 --> 00:55:08,639
Voluntarily went to the North?!

332
00:55:11,309 --> 00:55:16,105
So whet we're saying is if Wonil Jang
comes here quickly report it to this men

333
00:55:16,188 --> 00:55:20,234
And in the future, if you leave the village even for a day
please report to us Your children, too

334
00:55:20,318 --> 00:55:22,778
Are you keeping an eye on us? The family of
a soldier who received a medal of merit?

335
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:26,032
You're no longer a family of a merited soldier but
a soldier who defected to the North

336
00:55:26,365 --> 00:55:29,535
It's 180 degrees different
keep this in mind...

337
00:55:29,618 --> 00:55:31,329
we're always watching you...

338
00:55:32,246 --> 00:55:35,124
Please return the medal and certificate
of merit by tomorrow, please

339
00:55:40,171 --> 00:55:42,465
Don't cry
They say father's alive!

340
00:55:42,548 --> 00:55:46,052
What use is he alive now?
What are we going to live on?

341
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:47,928
Damn! Why take it out on me?

342
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:57,480
You... what's wrong with you?
What's wrong?

343
00:56:00,649 --> 00:56:04,028
Who's the bastard?
Tell me now!

344
00:56:05,488 --> 00:56:06,489
Look at me!

345
00:56:16,832 --> 00:56:17,750
Come here, bastard!

346
00:56:21,045 --> 00:56:27,968
You, you, you...
Hey, asshole, get up

347
00:57:01,877 --> 00:57:03,504
Go in. Go in, now

348
00:57:28,237 --> 00:57:29,447
Do you have some money?

349
00:57:34,869 --> 00:57:39,415
Hey! They're hiring over in the next village female factory workers
to make underwear for American soldiers

350
00:57:40,458 --> 00:57:42,793
Watcha gonna do at home?
You got kicked out of school anyway

351
00:57:42,835 --> 00:57:45,713
Oh! Get out! Get out and die
you worthless-!

352
00:57:47,256 --> 00:57:48,340
Dammit!

353
00:58:26,337 --> 00:58:30,466
They're commie bastards
who got executed during the War!

354
00:58:32,426 --> 00:58:36,639
They're small, small commies
These bastards

355
00:58:36,764 --> 00:58:39,683
these bastards did this to my leg!

356
00:58:41,227 --> 00:58:43,521
Is there anything else?

357
00:58:43,604 --> 00:58:45,439
Look here

358
00:58:51,028 --> 00:58:53,739
Look here, shouldn't you
report that to the police?

359
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:58,160
Report whatever... this rusty thing?

360
00:58:59,453 --> 00:59:02,957
Take the bones already and
bury them by the river!

361
00:59:05,584 --> 00:59:07,836
I thought the water
in our well was tasty...

362
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:10,673
You know They say rotting corpses
make the water taste good!

363
00:59:16,428 --> 00:59:19,557
- Clean this up!
- yeah

364
01:00:06,895 --> 01:00:08,355
I bet it'll shoot.

365
01:01:04,536 --> 01:01:08,457
It's been a long time since. I've heard a gunshot
Makes me think of the War

366
01:01:08,624 --> 01:01:10,959
How many commies
did your father kill?

367
01:01:12,378 --> 01:01:13,212
Three

368
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:17,966
That's right, three commies!
But no medal! Dammit!

369
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:23,764
You can't tell anyone
about the gun

370
01:02:01,218 --> 01:02:03,303
It's okay. Let me see
Look at me, like this

371
01:02:31,457 --> 01:02:35,085
Wow! With a normal eye
you'd be a shoo-in for Miss America

372
01:02:35,127 --> 01:02:36,462
Do you want eye surgery?

373
01:02:41,091 --> 01:02:45,095
That's easy enough for the American
Military Hospital to take care of

374
01:02:48,849 --> 01:02:52,352
If I help you, will you be
my sweetheart?

375
01:02:57,649 --> 01:03:02,112
Can you fix my eye?
really?

376
01:03:54,706 --> 01:03:58,460
I... I'm getting eye surgery today

377
01:03:59,044 --> 01:04:03,090
It's that American soldier, right?
No! Don't get the surgery!

378
01:04:05,133 --> 01:04:09,471
You... you want me to spend
the rest of my life only half living?

379
01:04:17,062 --> 01:04:18,313
Hold me

380
01:04:20,274 --> 01:04:23,110
Hold me... hold me

381
01:04:45,507 --> 01:04:48,260
No! I like you the way you are!

382
01:04:49,011 --> 01:04:50,846
Does this look okay to you?

383
01:04:50,929 --> 01:04:52,180
Tell me the truth!

384
01:04:54,433 --> 01:04:59,021
Can you smile at this confidently
for the rest of your life?

385
01:04:59,104 --> 01:05:00,397
Can you?

386
01:06:44,084 --> 01:06:45,544
Can you see me?

387
01:07:35,385 --> 01:07:37,220
You got paid today, right?

388
01:07:39,097 --> 01:07:40,682
You got paid today

389
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:45,103
You haven't studied!

390
01:07:45,145 --> 01:07:46,938
I'll ask you again, an easy one

391
01:07:47,522 --> 01:07:49,399
Why can't we be friends?

392
01:07:55,864 --> 01:07:57,532
My name...?

393
01:07:59,493 --> 01:08:01,828
Who asked you your name?

394
01:08:04,706 --> 01:08:05,874
Let's try it again with me!

395
01:08:10,378 --> 01:08:15,050
If you can't answer me then
you take five blows from me!

396
01:08:17,344 --> 01:08:19,387
You're a mix-blooded bastard, right?

397
01:08:21,348 --> 01:08:25,185
Yeah! That's right, asshole!

398
01:08:27,854 --> 01:08:31,983
Your mom was a western princess who sold
herself to American soldiers, right?

399
01:08:34,861 --> 01:08:38,907
Yeah, my morn was
a western princess

400
01:08:38,949 --> 01:08:40,534
You fuckin' piece of shits!

401
01:08:40,867 --> 01:08:46,498
It' s clicks like you who are so english hungry that'll
go abroad and come back to sell off our country!

402
01:08:46,581 --> 01:08:47,541
Hurry up and answer!

403
01:09:05,392 --> 01:09:06,643
The rest, you hit him!

404
01:09:10,814 --> 01:09:11,773
Go ahead!

405
01:09:17,112 --> 01:09:18,864
You said only five blows!

406
01:09:51,396 --> 01:09:52,105
How do you like that?

407
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:14,169
You like the ring?

408
01:10:17,047 --> 01:10:19,382
Now you can wear your hair back
You happy?

409
01:10:20,133 --> 01:10:20,800
Yes

410
01:10:29,226 --> 01:10:34,272
It's LSD Some doctor discovered it by
mistake trying to make some painkiller

411
01:10:36,316 --> 01:10:38,777
If I didn't have you and this
I'd go crazy right now

412
01:10:41,029 --> 01:10:41,446
Here

413
01:10:43,657 --> 01:10:45,533
One's okay
You won't get addicted

414
01:11:00,131 --> 01:11:00,882
I'm sorry!

415
01:11:02,509 --> 01:11:04,010
Don't take it if you don't want to

416
01:11:05,303 --> 01:11:07,055
I just wanted to let
you know how I feel

417
01:11:09,307 --> 01:11:10,225
I'm suffocating

418
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:17,607
My home has no mountains just flat
plains as far as the eye can see

419
01:11:19,234 --> 01:11:20,735
not like Korea

420
01:11:21,820 --> 01:11:24,364
So I have a hard time here being
blocked in by mountains

421
01:11:26,408 --> 01:11:30,787
If it weren't for you, I'd be
AWOL already. Believe me...

422
01:11:42,173 --> 01:11:43,550
You'll feel good in a second

423
01:11:45,885 --> 01:11:48,430
Let me see your eye
You see alright?

424
01:11:51,182 --> 01:11:52,767
Do you want to go to
the States with me?

425
01:11:53,852 --> 01:11:56,479
I could take you...

426
01:11:58,648 --> 01:11:59,274
Come here

427
01:12:24,257 --> 01:12:25,467
where are dog-eye?

428
01:12:30,138 --> 01:12:31,598
What a surprise!
What brings you to the butcher's?

429
01:12:33,641 --> 01:12:35,560
Don't get your hands bloody
use that

430
01:13:15,392 --> 01:13:18,812
Dammit! My hands are bloody
just the same!

431
01:14:20,290 --> 01:14:21,833
No!

432
01:14:25,003 --> 01:14:27,213
- I have a question!
- No!

433
01:14:27,297 --> 01:14:30,133
My husband name is michel!

434
01:14:36,097 --> 01:14:38,641
Please make me in the camp

435
01:14:38,725 --> 01:14:41,811
My husband name is michel!

436
01:14:41,895 --> 01:14:45,023
I want to my husband's address

437
01:14:45,064 --> 01:14:47,233
Please tell me the address
of my husband's camp

438
01:14:52,197 --> 01:14:53,031
Fuck!

439
01:15:20,266 --> 01:15:20,934
Who is it?

440
01:15:21,434 --> 01:15:23,061
Hey! Who is it?!

441
01:15:23,853 --> 01:15:24,646
What?

442
01:15:25,146 --> 01:15:28,316
All the wallets are gone!
Someone went through our clothes!

443
01:15:30,151 --> 01:15:31,903
You went into the shed for
some water before, right?

444
01:15:32,654 --> 01:15:34,864
I just had some water, that's all!

445
01:15:34,989 --> 01:15:37,033
Liar! You stealing
mix-blooded bastard!

446
01:15:38,993 --> 01:15:42,830
What did you say?
You bastard!

447
01:15:48,586 --> 01:15:49,837
What are you doing right now?

448
01:15:53,591 --> 01:15:56,761
This bastard stole our wallets
and is trying to back out of it!

449
01:15:58,429 --> 01:15:59,722
I didn't do it!

450
01:16:02,433 --> 01:16:03,935
I saw you going in there, too...

451
01:16:05,186 --> 01:16:08,648
What? You think being the
owner is everything?

452
01:16:09,315 --> 01:16:11,568
You're more suspicious!
Where are your things?

453
01:16:12,902 --> 01:16:15,154
What! This is ridiculous!

454
01:16:47,061 --> 01:16:48,980
Honey! Look at that!

455
01:16:50,565 --> 01:16:54,110
Hey, why are you stealing our stuff?

456
01:16:55,194 --> 01:16:56,446
Weren't you gonna throw this out?

457
01:16:56,571 --> 01:16:57,447
What?

458
01:16:57,488 --> 01:17:00,408
The bitch has a lot to say
being a thief!

459
01:17:01,909 --> 01:17:02,952
So I'll give it back!

460
01:17:02,994 --> 01:17:04,412
A big fuss over
a few cabbages!

461
01:17:04,704 --> 01:17:06,664
What gibberish is that coming from
your thieving bitchy mouth?

462
01:17:06,706 --> 01:17:08,458
Picking ones that aren't
even fully grown!

463
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:10,543
Go plant them back!

464
01:17:10,627 --> 01:17:11,878
What? Thieving bitch?

465
01:17:11,919 --> 01:17:12,754
Bitch!

466
01:17:13,713 --> 01:17:17,842
It's because you're so shameless
your life's a mess!

467
01:17:19,719 --> 01:17:20,428
What!

468
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:25,600
Crazy bitch!

469
01:17:25,767 --> 01:17:26,976
Why am I a crazy bitch?

470
01:17:31,856 --> 01:17:33,316
Bye-bye

471
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:37,195
Damn people...

472
01:19:18,963 --> 01:19:19,964
That bastard!

473
01:20:07,386 --> 01:20:12,934
You son of a bitch! Why do you keep hitting her? Why?
Don't you have any pity for your mom?

474
01:21:16,789 --> 01:21:18,207
The bastard
He won't hit you again

475
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:21,168
I kicked the living shit out of him

476
01:21:22,879 --> 01:21:26,257
You bastard
who are you to hit my son!

477
01:21:26,382 --> 01:21:28,384
He's already such a poor boy...

478
01:21:29,719 --> 01:21:31,262
Fuck!

479
01:21:52,033 --> 01:21:54,452
What the hell am I supposed to do?

480
01:22:43,334 --> 01:22:45,753
Shoot! Go ahead!

481
01:22:51,634 --> 01:22:52,468
Ah!

482
01:23:15,324 --> 01:23:16,701
That bastard!

483
01:23:24,667 --> 01:23:26,293
Rotten son of a bitch!
What are you doing right now?

484
01:26:14,879 --> 01:26:19,383
Chang-Guk, what's
going on with you today?

485
01:27:00,966 --> 01:27:03,969
Mom! Just bear it for
a minute! Please! Mom!

486
01:27:28,619 --> 01:27:29,453
Mom!

487
01:27:32,122 --> 01:27:33,499
Mom!

488
01:27:34,041 --> 01:27:36,377
I was wrong all this time!

489
01:27:40,047 --> 01:27:43,300
Please forgive me!

490
01:27:47,346 --> 01:27:50,557
I want to live happily
with you, too!

491
01:29:04,882 --> 01:29:07,343
Killed dogs and killed like a dog

492
01:29:08,886 --> 01:29:11,055
Is that a thing to say
in front of the dead?

493
01:29:12,973 --> 01:29:14,475
Chang-Guk...

494
01:29:24,902 --> 01:29:26,362
Where is your son?

495
01:29:26,987 --> 01:29:28,781
Your son killed the dog butcher!

496
01:29:29,323 --> 01:29:32,910
Get out! Get out!

497
01:29:36,705 --> 01:29:37,956
Chang-Guk!

498
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:41,001
Chang-Guk!

499
01:29:42,336 --> 01:29:43,796
Chang-Guk!

I killed 3 enemy soldiers

507
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:37,933

508
01:31:06,462 --> 01:31:10,299
Here. Now do you believe me? Look

509
01:31:11,383 --> 01:31:12,634
Who didn't believe you?

510
01:31:12,676 --> 01:31:14,094
We were just having our fun with you

511
01:31:14,761 --> 01:31:16,597
Is it made out of platinum?

512
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:18,265
Oh, careful

513
01:31:18,765 --> 01:31:20,893
Whether it's platinum or bronze,
who cares?

514
01:31:20,976 --> 01:31:24,229
It's all about the honor, right?

515
01:31:24,271 --> 01:31:26,315
Huh? It's nice. Beautiful!

516
01:31:36,825 --> 01:31:37,659
Dammit!

517
01:32:00,307 --> 01:32:01,391
Hey! Give me some money!

518
01:32:02,518 --> 01:32:04,061
Do you really like American
soldiers that much?

519
01:32:04,102 --> 01:32:05,604
You whoring bitch!

520
01:32:57,322 --> 01:32:58,282
Shit!

521
01:33:01,118 --> 01:33:02,869
Let go
you son of a bitch!

522
01:33:04,329 --> 01:33:10,002
Shameless bastard! Playing
with my younger sister like

523
01:33:10,043 --> 01:33:11,878
that and being stingy
with some dollars!

524
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:17,092
You're better off without
a brother like that

525
01:33:52,127 --> 01:33:54,046
Chang-Guk!

526
01:34:01,386 --> 01:34:02,763
Chang-Guk!

527
01:34:13,774 --> 01:34:14,316
Hey!

528
01:34:24,159 --> 01:34:26,078
You didn't forget the last
time, did ya when you hit me?

529
01:34:27,329 --> 01:34:29,164
Whatcha looking at?

530
01:34:30,457 --> 01:34:32,125
You bastard! Lower your eyes!

531
01:34:34,461 --> 01:34:35,796
Hey! You know
you look really scary...

532
01:34:56,149 --> 01:34:58,819
Shit! I've had it with this crap!
You think I'm your henchman?

533
01:34:58,860 --> 01:35:00,862
Have you gone crazy?

534
01:35:43,363 --> 01:35:46,575
Arrows are not to be
shot like that

535
01:35:46,616 --> 01:35:47,659
Here! Give it here

536
01:35:50,370 --> 01:35:52,038
You've got to first hold
the bow correctly...

537
01:35:55,375 --> 01:35:59,212
Look straight at the target
and hold your breath

538
01:35:59,379 --> 01:36:02,758
It's to empty your mind
Now pull it straight back like this

539
01:36:03,383 --> 01:36:04,217
Got it?

540
01:36:04,509 --> 01:36:05,802
Try it once

541
01:36:06,595 --> 01:36:07,429
Hold it good

542
01:36:10,474 --> 01:36:12,601
If you're excited
you'll miss the target

543
01:36:20,734 --> 01:36:21,902
That's good!

544
01:36:53,642 --> 01:36:55,977
It's that bastard who didn't
want you to get the surgery!

545
01:36:57,562 --> 01:37:01,233
What's he to you?
Look me in the eye and tell me!

546
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:07,405
Now that your eye is fixed
you're just going to dump me, huh?

547
01:37:07,447 --> 01:37:13,370
Just like you people, sucking all the sweet juices
and then spitting it out You think I don't know?

548
01:37:16,373 --> 01:37:18,667
Go! Get out!
You're all like that!

549
01:37:18,708 --> 01:37:21,378
You forget already what I've done for you?
Get out of here!

550
01:37:21,419 --> 01:37:22,879
Fucking whore!
I don't need you!

551
01:38:17,434 --> 01:38:18,560
Mom!

552
01:38:29,988 --> 01:38:31,615
Chang-Guk!

553
01:38:43,877 --> 01:38:46,004
Chang-Guk!

554
01:38:51,426 --> 01:38:55,889
Chang-Guk!

01:40:01,538 --> 01:40:03,790

557
01:41:56,820 --> 01:41:58,571
Lower! The enemy can spot you!

558
01:41:59,239 --> 01:42:01,991
You listening to me? I said, lower you
fucking moron! You'll be spotted!

559
01:42:02,075 --> 01:42:05,203
Damn it!
Where's the enemy?

560
01:42:06,162 --> 01:42:08,706
Son of a bitch!
That's an order! Crawl!

561
01:42:08,790 --> 01:42:11,709
What the hell are we doing here
in someone else's backyard?

562
01:42:12,502 --> 01:42:15,338
You like war that much?

563
01:42:17,715 --> 01:42:19,342
You lost your mind?

564
01:42:20,218 --> 01:42:22,095
Shoot! The enemy's right here!

565
01:42:22,137 --> 01:42:24,681
So shoot! Why can't you?

566
01:42:24,722 --> 01:42:26,933
What the hell!

567
01:42:27,809 --> 01:42:31,062
From this moment
I'm outta of here!

568
01:42:59,632 --> 01:43:01,676
No! No!

569
01:43:31,331 --> 01:43:34,042
I'm not a soldier anymore

570
01:43:58,608 --> 01:44:02,237
You want another?
Come lie down! Now!

571
01:44:55,915 --> 01:44:57,542
Stay still!
I'll carve my name real pretty!

572
01:45:13,182 --> 01:45:17,478
- Eunok!

573
01:45:18,354 --> 01:45:19,981
bitch!

574
01:45:37,582 --> 01:45:40,543
Kill me! Do it!

575
01:45:55,767 --> 01:45:59,145
There's no hope for me anyway...

576
01:46:24,253 --> 01:46:25,296
Freeze!

577
01:46:25,380 --> 01:46:27,715
Come and get me!

578
01:46:27,757 --> 01:46:30,802
Put the gun down! You're under arrest for
being AWOL and for the possession of drugs!

579
01:46:30,885 --> 01:46:33,346
Come and get me!

580
01:46:45,108 --> 01:46:47,985

I'm sick of it here! If you don't, I'll...

581
01:48:20,495 --> 01:48:22,038
Are you really not going to talk?

582
01:48:24,248 --> 01:48:26,584
Whose arrow is this?

583
01:48:27,627 --> 01:48:29,754
You shoot with each other
so you would know!

584
01:48:31,005 --> 01:48:33,007
We shot at the same time!

585
01:48:34,842 --> 01:48:38,012
If you don't talk
all three of you are going to jail!

586
01:48:45,770 --> 01:48:47,104
It's mine!

587
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:53,236
This is really your arrow, correct?

588
01:48:53,986 --> 01:48:56,239
That's right. So go ahead...

589
01:48:57,114 --> 01:48:58,032
Hey, Officer Lee

590
01:48:59,867 --> 01:49:03,496
He got a medal from the war
can't you go easy on him?

591
01:49:03,538 --> 01:49:05,206
It's not like the arrow killed him

592
01:49:05,206 --> 01:49:07,083
He's an American soldier!
An American!

593
01:49:09,460 --> 01:49:10,336
Take him away

594
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:12,129
Let my father go!

595
01:49:13,214 --> 01:49:14,048
I shot him!

596
01:49:14,799 --> 01:49:18,261
You brat! Stop your crap!
Hurry up and go home, you brat!

597
01:49:18,636 --> 01:49:23,140
- What's going on here? Did you really shoot him?
- Yes

598
01:49:24,308 --> 01:49:25,685
You small twit!

599
01:49:26,227 --> 01:49:27,937
Have you no fear
shooting an American soldier!

600
01:49:28,020 --> 01:49:31,816
Why are you hitting someone else's son?
This bastard's really asking for it!

601
01:49:56,132 --> 01:49:57,049
Hey, What do we have here?

602
01:50:02,096 --> 01:50:04,223
Open your mouth!

603
01:50:05,850 --> 01:50:06,434
OK!

604
01:50:21,240 --> 01:50:23,492
Huh? What are you doing here?

605
01:50:24,535 --> 01:50:25,536
This bastard...

606
01:50:30,541 --> 01:50:32,668
You did it, too, right?

607
01:50:34,170 --> 01:50:37,632
The girl's eye may be whacked but
her body was something else!

608
01:50:38,007 --> 01:50:39,842
You saw her perky breasts!
Pressing really close...

609
01:51:38,150 --> 01:51:39,860
What the hell

610
01:51:41,529 --> 01:51:42,405
Office sir!

611
01:51:43,656 --> 01:51:45,574
Hey! What are you doing?

612
01:51:45,658 --> 01:51:46,826
Let go, you son of a bitch!

613
01:51:55,251 --> 01:51:57,294
Hey, snap out of it
Get it loose!

614
01:52:00,881 --> 01:52:03,926
Breathe. Are you OK?

615
01:52:38,586 --> 01:52:39,628
Anyone home?

616
01:52:40,838 --> 01:52:43,799
Anyone home?
I have a letter for you!

617
01:55:08,611 --> 01:55:12,072
Stop... Stop!

618
01:55:13,240 --> 01:55:15,451
This bastard... Stop wha, punk?

619
01:55:15,534 --> 01:55:18,078
Stop! St-op!

620
01:55:20,581 --> 01:55:23,125
Stop! Stop the car!

621
01:56:19,264 --> 01:56:20,557
Dear chang-guk's mom

622
01:56:20,599 --> 01:56:21,266
How are you?

623
01:56:21,350 --> 01:56:22,184
