{2430}{2488}Fuck me, if he knows where we are.
{2504}{2537}You said it.
{2561}{2624}At least he hasn't led us to the enemy.
{2758}{2840}Guys, we'll wait until the fog lifts.
{2869}{2919}It's too risky to carry on.
{2989}{3041}With you, even drinking coffee is risky.
{3058}{3118}What a guide!
{3135}{3193}You try to do better in this fog!
{3198}{3270}Listen to him! He's always happy.
{3288}{3331}The eternal optimist.
{3354}{3429}Know the difference between|a pessimist and an optimist?
{3434}{3521}- No, what?|- A pessimist thinks things can't be worse.
{3523}{3586}An optimist knows they can.
{3678}{3786}You and your crap jokes.|No one else finds them funny.
{3802}{3870}If you had any brains at all, you'd give up.
{3881}{3960}Oh, yeah? If I had any, I wouldn't be here.
{3973}{4050}I'd be a general or a UN official.
{4053}{4130}Or I'd open a restaurant.|What's that look for?
{4244}{4336}It would help my budget|if you smoked your own.
{4342}{4437}<i>- Since you're offering...|- Who the fuck am I? Mother Teresa?</i>
{4534}{4581}Are you crazy?
{4593}{4640}You want them to see us?
{4642}{4720}Who's going to see us?|I can't even see my feet.
{4722}{4788}Put those cigarettes out! Put them out!
{5254}{5281}Hair in place?
{5641}{5683}He's something else!
{5703}{5794}First time at the front|and he dozes off before we get there.
{5812}{5858}<i>Kids these days...</i>
{6037}{6063}What?
{6326}{6433}- Any idea where we are?|- I reckon we should be there by now.
{6483}{6555}Dawn will soon be here and it'll be easier.
{6571}{6691}I never took a relief squad|to the front at night before.
{6746}{6783}<i>We got lucky...</i>

{25162}{25198}My little baby.
{25208}{25255}What do you think it is?
{25268}{25339}- A mine.|- A bouncing mine!
{25345}{25401}When the enemy steps on it...
{25411}{25514}...what happens, according to you?
{25541}{25610}- It explodes.|- No, nothing happens.
{25620}{25710}But when the enemy steps off it,|it bounces up...
{25735}{25803}...and explodes|about three feet off the ground...
{25812}{25930}...spraying out 2,000 lead bearings...
{25932}{26034}...that destroy everything|in a radius of 50 yards.
{26037}{26077}I'll show you.
{26098}{26145}Move this son of a bitch.
{26703}{26732}Gently.
{26841}{26879}Careful with the pin.
{26881}{26969}Lay the body down slowly,|otherwise you get blown up.
{27008}{27060}Go on, tug the wire now.
{27086}{27119}Me? Why me?
{27127}{27207}<i>Go on, don't worry,|as long as there's a weight...</i>
{27223}{27271}Do it gently, that's all.
{27559}{27592}I can't.
{27614}{27644}Chicken!
{27866}{27896}See that?
{27926}{27970}I invented this.
{27993}{28111}When they pick up the body|the mine will blow them all to hell.
{28142}{28195}- What's your name again?|- Nino.
{28214}{28261}You'll set the next one.
{28382}{28418}He looks asleep.
{28419}{28509}That's because he's still fresh.|It won't last in this heat.
{28533}{28625}Try to sleep. We'll leave once it's dark.
{28651}{28725}Afterwards, we'll set more of these babies.

{33079}{33124}Across the field? You're lying!
{33131}{33211}I'm not. Your side was blinded by the sun.
{33215}{33279}- And the mines?|- I don't know. He knew.
{34029}{34067}Where's the map?
{34069}{34142}- What map?|- Of Bolivia, stupid. Of the mines!
{34155}{34204}- Empty your pockets.|- Why?
{34211}{34280}Because I have a gun and you don't.|Come on.
{34484}{34518}Is that all?
{34880}{34908}Strip.
{34945}{34994}- What?|- Strip.
{35015}{35041}Why?
{35043}{35127}Are you stupid, or what?|Because I have a gun and you don't.
{35129}{35203}You may not have noticed,|but I'm in charge here.
{35328}{35364}I'm starving.
{35400}{35446}You're always starving.

{35747}{35777}What now?
{35952}{36009}- What the hell's that?|- Is he ours?
{36042}{36125}It's not written on his boxers.|Call the officer.
{36148}{36224}- What do I tell him?|- That the dead are walking.
{36615}{36657}Okay. Get down here.
{36772}{36819}You hear me? Come down.
{37820}{37848}He wasn't ours?
{37863}{37947}I've no idea. I only saw him for a second.
{37983}{38023}What a hawk-eye.
{38058}{38106}Let's not take any risks.
{38115}{38179}Hello. Put me through to the artillery.
{38277}{38354}- I can't see anything.|- He saw him, too.
{38374}{38459}- One of ours?|- God knows. He only had boxer shorts on.
{38916}{38964}Any other brilliant ideas?
{38983}{39050}If you piss me off, you go back out there.
{39272}{39310}They've stopped.
{39389}{39448}Sure. Yours never stop.
{39456}{39516}How about yours? Do they ever stop?
{39536}{39595}You can't compare.|We didn't start the war.
{39600}{39638}And maybe we did?
{39640}{39732}No! The Khmer Rouge!|All you can do is make war.
{39738}{39799}- Us?|- No, you're pacifists.
{39801}{39860}The Great Serbia,|all the way to the Pacific!
{39865}{39929}Please. The whole world thinks like me.
{39941}{39987}What world? Your world!
{39991}{40102}You show our burned villages|and say they're yours.
{40104}{40156}And that's my side shooting now?
{40162}{40259}You're all saints. Give it a rest.
{40261}{40310}You don't even leave the dead in peace.
{40325}{40362}It's not the same.
{40374}{40479}Really? Laying mines under the dead,|pillaging, killing, raping, what's all that?
{40481}{40525}- Who are you talking about?|- You guys!
{40527}{40608}I haven't seen anything like what you say.
{40609}{40693}I've seen it! I saw my village burn.
{40724}{40786}- I don't know. I wasn't there.|- I was!
{40861}{40948}Haven't our villages burned, too?|Who killed our people?
{40981}{41055}Your side, probably.|They just shot at you, too.
{41069}{41156}<i>They only shot at me|because they didn't recognize me.</i>
{41217}{41270}It's useless talking to you.
{41279}{41377}What the hell made you ruin|this beautiful country?
{41379}{41408}- Us?|- Yes!
{41410}{41495}You're crazy.|You wanted to separate, not us.
{41522}{41582}Because you started the war!
{41584}{41648}- You started it!|- What? Who started it?
{41650}{41728}You started the war! You started it!
{41739}{41781}Who started the war?
{41861}{41913}- We did.|- You started the war.
{41921}{42002}And stop pissing me off.|You're getting on my nerves.
{42041}{42124}Get out! Come on, get out of here!
{42157}{42185}Fuck.
{42224}{42274}Daring to say it was us.
{42478}{42518}What was all that?
{42570}{42662}I'll alert HQ. Call me if there's any change.
{43013}{43087}- What now?|- Nothing. We wait till dark.
{43129}{43160}And then?
{43174}{43265}Then, if you survive,|we'll crawl over to the lines.
{43280}{43328}And stop bothering me.
{43343}{43410}- So you're not going to free me.|- Dream on.
{43548}{43590}Cera, you're alive!

{43981}{44060}- Are you kidding me?|- Do I look like I'm kidding?
{44148}{44186}Come here. Defuse it.
{44287}{44354}- You hear me? Defuse it!|- I don't know how.
{44418}{44510}Don't fool around. Defuse it!|I'm going to kill you! Defuse it!
{44516}{44574}If I try, I'll kill us all.
{44609}{44674}Fuck. What is this shit?
{44686}{44738}Ciki, what's happening?
{44762}{44868}They laid a mine under you|to ambush our guys.
{44876}{44931}Only they could think of that!
{44943}{44973}Kill him.
{45069}{45116}Kill the son of a bitch.
{45171}{45222}Kill him or give me the gun!
{45317}{45342}No.
{45386}{45429}We're not like them.
{45510}{45572}Besides, he could be useful.|Bring the water over.

{46038}{46069}Where does it hurt?
{46071}{46137}My head and my arm.|My head's going to burst.

{46278}{46322}What about the others?
{46440}{46485}Don't let me die here.
{46490}{46544}Don't worry. Does it hurt anywhere else?
{46546}{46572}No.
{46628}{46712}You lucky bastard.|You're unharmed. Just your arm.
{46714}{46751}And I thought you were dead.

{47837}{47884}Okay, but nice and easy.
{47946}{47989}If you fuck about...
{48007}{48076}...I'll shoot without warning, you hear me?
{48186}{48221}Let me see your hands!

{50491}{50520}We did.
{50586}{50661}- You started the war.|- Who cares who started it?
{50679}{50734}We're all in the same shit now.
{50752}{50798}Can I have a cigarette?

{54416}{54447}What now?
{54483}{54520}I have an idea.

{64860}{64916}Does anyone here know languages?
{65115}{65175}We are here, this place.
{65270}{65311}Where are the men?
{65392}{65434}Here? Here people?
{65452}{65483}Soldiers?
{65521}{65587}- Any mine?|- No mine.
{65596}{65641}- You sure?|- No mine.
{65704}{65743}We go now.
{65755}{65809}Okay? We go, you don't shoot.
{65832}{65882}Shoot, no. Nobody shoots.
{65897}{65943}- Yeah.|- Okay, thank you.
{66067}{66105}Tell HQ the UNPROFOR is here.
{66107}{66177}I don't want anybody shooting.|Is that clear?
{66301}{66366}- Sorry about earlier.|- You were right.
{66403}{66485}Why get acquainted|to watch each other through sights?
{66521}{66608}- In any case, thanks for the idea.|- Let's hope it works.
{66670}{66733}What's going on? Think they understood?
{66821}{66899}- How is he?|- How do you expect him to be?
{66921}{66989}- Have you known him long?|- Since the war.
{67029}{67095}Since the beginning of this fucking war.
{67098}{67153}What about you and the old man?
{67185}{67235}I don't even know his name.
{67280}{67317}You're from Banja Luka.
{67319}{67386}How do you know? Yeah, right.
{67450}{67530}I had a chick in Banja Luka. Sanja.
{67567}{67602}I knew a Sanja, too.
{67613}{67667}<i>- She had...|- This one, too.</i>
{67723}{67752}- Blonde.|- Yes.
{67754}{67778}- Tall.|- Yes.
{67786}{67821}With a beauty spot.
{67833}{67880}- Sanja Cengic!|- I was at school with her.
{67882}{67924}- No kidding?|- I swear.
{67973}{68006}- Cera!|- Yeah.
{68009}{68068}He knows the Sanja I mentioned!
{68085}{68120}Brilliant.
{68183}{68226}What's become of her?
{68269}{68309}She's gone abroad.
{68384}{68424}I don't blame her.
{68540}{68601}BOSNIAN BARRICADE
{68757}{68829}- Hello. Do you speak French?|- No, English.
{68839}{68960}<i>- Okay, we are here for people...|- Yes, we called. You can go.</i>
{68962}{69009}- It's okay? We go?|- Go.
{69026}{69099}- Any mines there?|- We didn't put any.
{69152}{69191}Okay. Go ahead.
{69524}{69596}<i>- Sarajevo on line.|- Hello, Col. Soft speaking.</i>
{69601}{69688}<i>- Hello, sir. This is Capt. Dubois.|- How can I help you?</i>
{69698}{69789}<i>It's the first time that the two camps|are asking me for the same thing...</i>
{69790}{69841}<i>... and I don't know what to do.</i>
{69842}{69922}Why are you asking me|and not your superiors?
{69924}{70007}<i>They are all in Geneva|for a seminar on media relations.</i>
{70030}{70110}It seems from your report that these men...
{70112}{70185}...are stranded between the two front lines.
{70186}{70269}But we don't even know|if they are soldiers or not. Is that right?
{70286}{70325}What do you expect me to do?
{70326}{70414}I can't risk the lives of our soldiers|in order to save theirs.
{70416}{70517}Do I have to remind you of the precise|purpose of our mission here in Bosnia?
{70518}{70583}<i>Since it is the first time|that the two camps are...</i>
{70585}{70661}You know perfectly well|that there is nothing that I can do...
{70663}{70746}...without the approval of the General|Assembly of the United Nations.
{70748}{70817}I don't think the General Assembly|will convene itself...
{70818}{70924}...specifically to deal with the problems|of two unknown individuals...
{70953}{70993}...trapped in no man's land.
{70995}{71066}There is nothing I can do.|I don't have the authority.
{71067}{71110}<i>What should I tell them, sir?</i>
{71111}{71178}Tell them that, as usual,|neither side can agree.
{71180}{71234}Tell them anything you like. Good-bye.
{71955}{71993}Is someone coming?
{72005}{72065}Probably. See, they've stopped shooting.
{72074}{72101}Fuck.
{72146}{72217}I don't even know|what this shithole's called.
{72228}{72313}- I'd hate to die here.|- Stop being a pain in the ass.
{72321}{72405}They'll get a mine expert|and it'll soon be over.
{72509}{72566}I told you, we'll leave together.
{72883}{72947}Here come the Smurfs! Cera!|The Smurfs!
{73205}{73268}If they radio us, call me immediately.
{73274}{73331}What if something happens to you?
{73443}{73479}- Hello.|- Hello.
{73495}{73543}- Do you speak French?|- No.
{73570}{73607}- English?|- A little.
{73614}{73673}One's a Serb and one's Bosnian.
{73691}{73726}How did they get here?
{73728}{73827}- Do we take the dead guys' guns?|- No, it's okay.
{73829}{73890}- You're okay?|- Yes, okay.
{73933}{74009}We come to help you. My name is Neil.
{74043}{74071}He needs help.
{74079}{74130}- Is he wounded?|- Yes.
{74211}{74287}We must not move him. Mines.
{74323}{74391}We move him, mine explode.
{74435}{74528}- He's on a mine that could blow.|- Thanks for the translation.
{74567}{74618}What the fuck happened here?
{74667}{74768}<i>- Okay, don't worry.|- Yes, but...</i>
{74804}{74838}Stop!
{75027}{75055}Oh, shit.
{75090}{75162}A bouncing mine. These guys are crazy.
{75163}{75226}What a fuck-up. We need the mine squad.
{75243}{75290}Sarge! Charlie Tango calling.
{75292}{75346}Okay, I'll come back in two minutes.
{75348}{75406}Michel, give them water and food.
{75477}{75515}What did he say?
{75663}{75752}Arizona 2 to Charlie Tango, come in.
{75791}{75888}<i>Arizona 2, we have orders not to move.|Things are too risky.</i>
{75914}{75996}We're already on the spot.|Everything's under control.
{76002}{76066}Both sides are respecting the cease-fire.
{76078}{76150}We have three evacuees|and need a mine expert.
{76172}{76209}<i>Who's speaking?</i>
{76250}{76290}Sgt. Marchand.
{76299}{76360}<i>You have 5 minutes to pull out...</i>
{76367}{76426}<i>... and 15 to call me from the checkpoint.</i>
{76428}{76500}<i>And report to the duty officer|on your return/</i>
{76527}{76626}Sir, could you send a mine squad?|We have an emergency here.
{76632}{76685}<i>The only emergency is to pull out.</i>
{76693}{76795}<i>I repeat, for the last time,|I want you out in 5 minutes...</i>
{76799}{76861}<i>... and call me in 15 to confirm...</i>
{76863}{76933}<i>... that you're back|and that your men are safe.</i>
{76944}{77028}<i>Or I'll have you arrested.|I'll be expecting your call.</i>
{77067}{77094}Idiot!
{77171}{77205}Get back in.
{77227}{77257}What for?
{77280}{77306}We must leave.
{77307}{77344}- What?|- They're leaving.
{77349}{77428}- You'll come back?|- I don't know, my boss said we must leave.
{77451}{77502}I'm sorry. I'll try to come back.
{77550}{77611}Thank God we can count on you.
{77631}{77674}If you want, I take you with me.
{77675}{77730}- What?|- We can go with him.
{77745}{77825}Really? Thank him nicely|and tell him he can fuck off!
{77831}{77879}- Ciki, go.|- Shut up.
{77894}{77930}Go and bring back help.
{78033}{78063}Wait!
{78067}{78102}I'll come with you.
{78123}{78162}- Where are you going?|- With them.
{78163}{78220}- You're going nowhere!|- Why?
{78234}{78328}This is all your fault.|If you stay, your side won't shoot.
{78336}{78408}- They won't shoot, I swear.|- You're staying here.
{78423}{78482}You're going to shoot me? Go ahead!
{78484}{78526}Stop fooling around!
{78547}{78575}No!
{78604}{78643}Stop, guys!
{78668}{78716}Okay! Cool! Stop!
{78727}{78762}Lower your weapons!
{78776}{78812}Michel, get in!
{79036}{79062}What happened?
{79072}{79117}- What a fuck-up.|- They're maniacs!
{79119}{79137}Shut it!
{79156}{79225}- I knew this would be shitty.|- Shut it!
{79371}{79442}- You're crazy, you maniac!|- I warned you.
{79482}{79577}I'll kill you for this! I swear!
{79595}{79647}I've fucking had it with you.
{79857}{79928}Keep cool just a while longer. Screw them.
{79934}{80001}It'll be dark soon|and I'll think of something.
{80176}{80214}How does this shit work?
{80269}{80322}I'm sick of asking you!
{80335}{80368}Fuck knows!
{80394}{80461}It explodes|when you take the weight away.
{80562}{80635}Here we are at a Bosnian barricade|near the town of Tuzla...
{80640}{80688}...talking to the Bosnian Commander.
{80689}{80756}How do you feel about the talks in Geneva?
{80765}{80833}I'd like to go there.|Would you go with me?
{80842}{80924}Are you resentful that people are talking|while you are suffering?
{80954}{80989}What happened?
{81055}{81133}It's very confused.|We go now and bring some help.
{81153}{81225}- Why don't you tell them the truth?|- Who are you?
{81248}{81307}I am Jane Livingston,|Global News Channel...
{81311}{81429}...and this is Sgt. Marchand,|otherwise known as Arizona 2.
{81456}{81494}Stop the engine.
{81524}{81604}- How do you know that?|- We were listening to your radio frequency.
{81610}{81684}Since we were in the area,|we thought we'd come and verify.
{81689}{81745}- You listened to our radio?|- Absolutely.
{81753}{81805}It's the best way to get fresh information.
{81810}{81907}Are you going back?|Why do you need a bomb disposal unit?
{81920}{81948}Stop the camera.
{81960}{82023}- Can you take us there?|- No, I have to go.
{82039}{82067}That's right.
{82080}{82200}You're just here to distribute|humanitarian aid.
{82215}{82285}Okay, we'll go without you.|Come on, let's go.
{82297}{82356}You can't. It's too dangerous.
{82398}{82427}Is that an order?
{82506}{82566}Okay, stop filming, please.
{82718}{82747}Please?
{82768}{82805}Yes, all right.
{82996}{83060}Maybe I can help you if you'll help me.
{83080}{83135}We have an English TV crew here.
{83140}{83188}They know everything.
{83200}{83288}Other crews are on the way.|They picked up our frequency.
{83300}{83356}I didn't answer their questions.
{83388}{83460}Hello, Captain.|This is Jane Livingston of Global News.
{83462}{83510}I can hear everything you're saying.
{83512}{83597}Are we to assume that the UNPROFOR|are doing absolutely nothing...
{83599}{83679}...for those who are wounded|and trapped between the two fronts?
{83681}{83776}Who made this decision?|Are headquarters aware of the situation?
{83805}{83920}<i>You know very well that you have no right|to listen or to use this frequency.</i>
{83925}{84007}<i>Get off it immediately|or we'll confiscate your press card. Over.</i>
{84044}{84083}Is that a threat?
{84097}{84189}<i>Listen, Miss Livingston,|I was not in any way threatening you.</i>
{84195}{84271}<i>Please, try to understand.|We are doing what we can.</i>
{84280}{84392}<i>At this moment we are in negotiations|with both camps to arrange a ceasefire.</i>
{84400}{84489}<i>As you know, the situation|is extremely complicated and takes time.</i>
{84504}{84527}That's a lie.
{84537}{84615}Can you tell me where these negotiations|are and who's in charge?
{84617}{84698}I have my second unit on hand here|who could cover it immediately.
{84707}{84762}<i>I have no more information|for the moment.</i>
{84779}{84843}You're telling me|that negotiations are taking place...
{84845}{84912}...but you don't know where they are|or who's in charge.
{84917}{84956}At the same time...
{84957}{85062}...you've requested that your soldiers|who were on the scene return to base.
{85077}{85124}<i>I just carry out orders.</i>
{85149}{85209}Who issues these orders?|Can I have a name?
{85218}{85278}<i>I cannot disclose military affairs.</i>
{85289}{85367}<i>First of all, I must request authorization|from my superiors.</i>
{85411}{85476}Fine, go ahead.|I'll wait right here for your answer.
{85477}{85551}I'm preparing a news report|which goes off in half an hour...
{85553}{85618}...and it will be fascinating|to monitor the response...
{85620}{85686}...of millions of our viewers|who will watch the show.
{85692}{85725}Thank you, Captain.
{85729}{85780}<i>Arizona 2, are you still there?</i>
{85797}{85846}Affirmative, Charlie Tango.
{85853}{85912}<i>Stay there until further orders.|Over and out.</i>
{85951}{85996}Message received, sir.
{86022}{86076}- Could I...|- No, please, not now.
{86233}{86278}Why are you doing this?
{86303}{86356}I'm sick of being a bystander.
{86367}{86425}- What would you do?|- What I'd do?
{86449}{86544}I'd stop the madmen ruining this country.|We have what it takes.
{86564}{86605}Aren't you neutral?
{86647}{86707}You can't be neutral facing murder.
{86720}{86772}Doing nothing to stop it is taking sides.
{86774}{86840}Magnificent. Will you say that on camera?
{86859}{86903}I may be mad, but I'm not stupid.
{86905}{86952}- Jane.|- Yeah, I'm coming.
{86965}{87007}I'll be right back.
{87437}{87486}- What's wrong?|- My leg's itching.
{87488}{87516}Wait.
{87545}{87613}You want to blow us away?|I'll scratch you.
{87631}{87668}Lower.
{87679}{87743}Again. To the left.
{87767}{87810}There. That's good.
{87977}{88016}I need the toilet.
{88154}{88196}Piss in your pants.
{88219}{88256}It's the other.
{88379}{88411}It's okay.
{88487}{88529}Easy for you to say.
{88539}{88583}Here at the Bosnian barricade...
{88589}{88660}...we do not know if this is yet another|mission impossible...
{88668}{88746}...or if, indeed, they will actually decide|to do something.
{88759}{88789}<i>Thank you, Jane.</i>
{88791}{88880}<i>Let's take a look at the history|of UN involvement in the Bosnian conflict.</i>
{89012}{89064}Martha, get me Capt. Dubois, please.
{89065}{89137}<i>He just called,|but I told him that you were out.</i>
{89143}{89193}Call him back and tell him I'm here.
{89209}{89292}<i>You're pushing Bosnia-Herzegovina...</i>
{89306}{89400}<i>... to follow the same path|of horror and suffering...</i>
{89402}{89452}<i>... as Slovenia and Croatia.</i>
{89464}{89565}<i>You'll lead Bosnia into hell|and this may end up...</i>
{89566}{89611}<i>... exterminating the Muslim people/</i>
{89637}{89715}<i>Radovan Karadzic didn't wait long|to carry out his threat.</i>
{89719}{89826}<i>Bosnian Serb paramilitary forces,|largely helped by the Yugoslav army...</i>
{89828}{89877}<i>... furiously attacked Bosnian cities...</i>
{89879}{89952}<i>... that were defended only|by armed Bosnian civilians...</i>
{89954}{90036}<i>... and the rest of the police forces|loyal to the Bosnian government.</i>
{90038}{90112}<i>Serbs started massive attacks|against civilian targets...</i>
{90118}{90225}<i>... spreading fear and terror and introducing|a new term: Ethnical cleansing.</i>
{90240}{90303}<i>The world community|finally decided to do something...</i>
{90305}{90402}<i>... after Serb artillery massacred people|waiting in lines for bread.</i>
{90406}{90477}<i>UN Security Council|decided to send to Bosnia...</i>
{90478}{90557}<i>... 9,000 troops supported by|the American 6th Fleet.</i>
{90582}{90662}<i>At the moment when the whole world|expected military intervention...</i>
{90664}{90748}<i>... French President François Mitterrand|lands in Sarajevo...</i>
{90755}{90809}<i>... a city that was already under siege.</i>
{90812}{90903}<i>Bosnians received him as a savior,|but he had different plans.</i>
{90914}{91009}<i>After meeting with Radovan Karadzic,|he opened Sarajevo airport...</i>
{91014}{91093}<i>... and started wide-scale|humanitarian aid action.</i>
{91123}{91243}<i>UN troops were assigned to protect|and follow the UNHCR food convoys...</i>
{91254}{91317}<i>... without any right to interfere|in the conflict.</i>
{91318}{91395}<i>Today, Bosnians are still denied|the right to defend themselves...</i>
{91397}{91450}<i>... by an imposed UN weapon embargo...</i>
{91456}{91569}<i>... although, at this very moment, war|continues without any signs of pacification.</i>
{91588}{91646}<i>The tragedy|of the Bosnian nation continues...</i>
{91653}{91773}<i>... and the only help they've got now|is 120 grams of humanitarian aid per day.</i>
{91818}{91877}<i>For those joining us now,|we have news from Bosnia...</i>
{91878}{91927}<i>... where some men|are caught in no man's land.</i>
{91929}{91975}<i>Our correspondent|Jane Livingston is there.</i>
{91977}{92049}<i>We're waiting to see which measure|will be taken by UNPROFOR.</i>
{92051}{92105}<i>Is there anything you'd like to add, Jane?</i>
{92109}{92212}<i>Olivia, I would like to repeat the words|that I heard here only moments ago.</i>
{92234}{92310}<i>"Neutrality does not exist|in the face of murder.</i>
{92315}{92392}<i>"Doing nothing to stop it is,|in fact, choosing.</i>
{92399}{92451}<i>"It is not being neutral."</i>
{92492}{92545}<i>Thank you, Jane.|We'll come back to you later.</i>
{92546}{92635}<i>That was Jane Livingston, live from Bosnia.|We'll be back after this.</i>
{92788}{92889}Martha, gonna need a helicopter|and a map of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
{92898}{92997}How was it? We haven't had an|opportunity like that in a very long time.
{93023}{93049}Yeah.
{93067}{93143}I know. I just hope it will make them|move their asses, you know?
{93166}{93214}Yeah. That's right.
{93223}{93283}Okay. I'll call you as soon as we get there.
{93285}{93381}Shit! We weren't the only ones listening|to the UNPROFOR, obviously.
{93414}{93449}Hi, John.
{93502}{93560}Okay, guys. We have the go-ahead.
{93610}{93666}Stay here while we check things.
{93667}{93713}Come on. That's not what we agreed.
{93721}{93812}It's too dangerous now.|You can move in with the mine expert.
{93824}{93895}<i>No! You said that you would take us up...</i>
{93942}{93976}Fucking French.
{94014}{94047}Really, I'm sick of it.
{95843}{95898}Give me the photo in my pocket.
{95929}{95982}- Which pocket?|- The top one.
{96011}{96035}This one.
{96169}{96202}Let me see.
{96215}{96328}- Why do soldiers always carry photos?|- I've no idea. Let me see.
{96384}{96429}I can't see like that.
{96673}{96770}- Think I'll see her again?|- Cut it out, of course you will.
{96839}{96866}Ciki!
{96982}{97031}Stop it, for God's sake!
{97034}{97060}Shit!
{97181}{97213}You stop!
{97218}{97256}Watch the knife!
{97275}{97306}Stop now!
{97329}{97401}It's over! You stop! Help is coming.
{97432}{97515}The mining squad is coming.|You understand? You tell him.
{97543}{97591}The mine squad's coming!
{97598}{97633}I'll kill you for this!
{97781}{97822}It's good for you.
{97855}{97888}Help coming.
{97959}{98025}I'll get reinforcements.|Keep an eye on them...
{98032}{98079}...and clean his wound.
{98243}{98317}Take this. Call me if there's a problem.
{98768}{98850}- What's happening?|- Okay, you'll be able to film.
{98851}{98876}Are you sure?
{98878}{98938}Everything okay? Are you all right?
{99193}{99235}- Sgt. Marchand.|- Capt. Dubois.
{99239}{99316}- Captain, can you tell us what's going on?|- Just one moment, please.
{99323}{99407}- Can we have an interview later?|- I told you, one minute.
{99421}{99486}- What's going on?|- A hell of a mess, sir.
{99497}{99555}It's really tense. We just had to intervene.
{99558}{99640}We're taking no risks.|Any trouble, we pull out, okay?
{99672}{99757}- What about the reporters?|- We let them film everything.
{99782}{99827}Isn't that what you wanted?
{99851}{99910}I'm not stupid, Sgt. Marchand.
{99955}{100052}Ladies and gentleman, I am Capt. Dubois.
{100067}{100138}In a few minutes,|I will take you on the site.
{100144}{100226}I suppose you all have your press cards,|helmets and flak jackets.
{100243}{100303}Sgt. Marchand here|is going to brief you now.
{100314}{100433}We have there a soldier that is laying|on a mine. We have to de-mine it.
{100453}{100518}Nobody can go in the hole.|It's too dangerous.
{100524}{100595}Don't go around because|we don't know if there are any mines.
{100627}{100751}The situation is extremely complicated|and I want your total cooperation.
{100767}{100821}Whoever will not respect the rules...
{100823}{100897}...will be thrown out|and their press card will be confiscated.
{100922}{100989}Go now into your cars.|We'll leave in a few minutes.
{100991}{101023}Please go.
{101206}{101286}- You never mentioned a man on a mine.|- I didn't?
{101308}{101343}I forgot. Shall we go?
{101350}{101420}- We wait for the mine expert.|- He isn't with you?
{101424}{101487}Ours were busy.|They're sending a German.
{101493}{101570}He should be here at 3:30. It's 3:30 now.
{101732}{101769}Bang on the dot.
{101775}{101801}What?
{101915}{101956}Capt. Dubois. Do you speak French?
{101959}{101979}No.
{101980}{102024}- English, of course.|- Of course.
{102026}{102099}- You know the situation?|- No, we had no time for a briefing.
{102104}{102175}We don't have much time,|so you follow us, I will explain you.
{102180}{102224}Over there. Follow us.
{102674}{102777}At this very moment the UNPROFOR|are trying to help the third soldier...
{102779}{102815}...who is lying on a mine.
{102822}{102899}The absurdity of war continues,|taking on a different guise.
{102910}{102986}How will all this end?|Stay tuned to Global News.
{102989}{103050}Jane Livingston, live from Bosnia.
{103307}{103335}Here.
{103410}{103447}Excuse me...
{103470}{103522}...can I make interview with you?
{103525}{103600}Go fuck yourself!|You're the last thing I need.
{103671}{103746}Fucking Balkanian.|What the fuck are you doing?
{103773}{103812}- I just thought...|- Don't think.
{103814}{103859}I'm the one who thinks around here.
{103986}{104059}Excuse me, would you like a cigarette?
{104167}{104230}Do you speak a little English?
{104286}{104355}- Little.|- I can do interview with you?
{104399}{104429}Roll.
{104469}{104540}- How do you feel?|- Okay.
{104565}{104620}- Do you feel tired?|- Yes.
{104646}{104738}Was it you who put the mine|underneath the other soldier?
{105068}{105105}Fucking bastard. Cut!
{105393}{105464}I'll kill him, even if it's the last thing I do.
{105481}{105555}- What's wrong with you?|- I should have killed him.
{105581}{105648}See that? I spared him and now...
{105652}{105723}...he's tried to kill me with my own knife!
{105845}{105883}How do you feel?
{105915}{105985}Great. Couldn't be better.
{106014}{106109}First, they shoot at me,|then I wake up on a mine...
{106124}{106200}...the whole world's watching me,|I need to shit...
{106215}{106289}...and you piss me off|with your stupid stories.
{106357}{106390}It'll soon be over.
{106670}{106725}- You are okay?|- Yes, I'm ready.
{106749}{106810}Now, I need everybody out of the place.
{106814}{106890}We need the safety parameters|at least 30 meters.
{106901}{106936}Okay. I'll do it.
{106939}{106973}Move everybody out.
{107377}{107466}Okay, please, now, you must go back.|We will start de-mining.
{107619}{107663}Michel, let's get going!
{107714}{107791}You must leave now.|De-miner wants everybody out.
{107797}{107825}You, out.
{107886}{107986}Yes, he out, too.|Later, when we finish. Understand?
{107997}{108048}They'll bring him out later.
{108090}{108149}If I need a translator, I'll find one.
{108151}{108181}Let's go.
{108290}{108314}Calm down!
{108316}{108352}You cannot stay here, okay?
{108401}{108473}Tell him if he stays here|we will not start working.
{108486}{108541}It's a question of security.|Say it to your friend.
{108542}{108573}He's not my friend.
{108581}{108668}I know, but please,|I have no other translator. Tell him.
{108694}{108804}- They'll do nothing until we go.|- I don't need a translator!
{108840}{108881}Go fuck yourself, asshole!
{109006}{109077}Keep your cool. Just go.
{109164}{109214}I'll wait for you up there.
{109277}{109312}Keep an eye on him.
{109348}{109376}Okay?
{109486}{109578}You can probably just make out|behind me, as I'm speaking to you...
{109583}{109700}...the Serbian soldier, limping,|closely followed by the Bosnian soldier.
{109709}{109794}These two men, at least,|will be walking to their safety.
{109797}{109860}But they will be leaving behind|the third soldier...
{109866}{109928}...who is still patiently waiting|on the mine...
{109933}{110001}...for the bomb-disposal expert|to save his life.
{110004}{110065}For him, the ordeal is not yet over.
{110076}{110149}This is Jane Livingston, live from Bosnia...
{110152}{110209}...for Global News. Stay tuned.
{110654}{110685}Get lost!
{110725}{110755}Fuck you!
{110865}{110949}Asshole! I give him bandages|and he refuses them.
{110966}{111009}They're all maniacs!
{111103}{111181}<i>- It's John here. Are you still there?|- Yes. Hello?</i>
{111200}{111306}Okay. Listen, this is really great,|but it would be fantastic if you could...
{111318}{111368}...get the story of the guy on the mine.
{111370}{111410}<i>I'll try. I mean...</i>
{111436}{111530}Maybe you could get a close-up of him|when they're clearing the mine?
{111562}{111595}<i>Yeah, I'll try.</i>
{111614}{111668}Have you interviewed|the other two guys yet?
{111670}{111752}<i>No, unfortunately they won't let me|get anywhere near them.</i>
{111771}{111811}Go get it, Jane. Come on!
{111817}{111898}As soon as you get it, we'll go live again.|Okay? Good luck.
{111905}{111937}<i>Thank you.</i>
{112670}{112702}Don't move.
{113196}{113235}Fuck, what a job.
{113314}{113392}They say a mine expert|only ever makes one mistake.
{113413}{113462}- Two mistakes.|- How come?
{113500}{113562}The first is when he chooses the job.
{115445}{115482}What is happening?
{115513}{115591}There's too much stones.|I can't approach the mine.
{115606}{115673}I don't even see what kind of mine it is.
{115678}{115712}I know. Wait.
{115996}{116070}- Is this the mine that is under the body?|- Yeah.
{116346}{116386}I can do nothing.
{116398}{116460}- What?|- It's impossible to de-activate...
{116462}{116533}...this kind of stuff|once the mechanism is on.
{116595}{116664}This man is already dead.
{116689}{116766}Are you sure? Can't you put something|between him and the mine?
{116775}{116822}Maybe another de-miner knows better.
{116830}{116870}You can call whoever you want.
{116872}{116990}Nobody, nothing in the world can de-mine|this stuff, not in these conditions.
{117004}{117049}At least I don't know about it.
{117418}{117481}Deus ex machina. He's all we needed.
{118403}{118483}Why are you here? Do you consider it|such an important mission?
{118507}{118575}We consider all our missions|to be of the utmost importance.
{118577}{118665}Our job here is to expedite|the peace process in this country.
{118691}{118764}You didn't want to intervene.|It was your soldiers...
{118771}{118848}...who were sick and tired of waiting,|who initiated the action.
{118866}{118935}I'm afraid you got|the wrong end of the story here.
{118937}{119010}This is a simple new system of command.
{119022}{119116}If it's effective, then the unit in the field|will have much greater mobility.
{119131}{119190}What do you have to say about|the Americans' accusations...
{119192}{119289}...that Europe's incapacity to do anything|is due to UNPROFOR's internal problems?
{119299}{119376}I've heard no such accusations.|You must judge for yourself.
{119383}{119472}The UNPROFOR is perfectly fulfilling|its mission. Thank you very much.
{119484}{119560}What are the relationships between|the British and the French?
{119563}{119644}I think we'll have to deal with that later.|It's far too complicated.
{119718}{119757}- Thank you.|- My pleasure.
{119766}{119812}- How's it going?|- We have a problem, sir.
{119814}{119867}- What problem?|- One of the soldiers is on a mine.
{119869}{119898}It's impossible to defuse it.
{119900}{119923}What?
{119929}{120002}The mine disposal expert says|it is impossible to defuse it.
{120067}{120173}This whole fucking business stinks|to high heaven, as I said from the start.
{120216}{120309}If the journalists get one whiff of this,|they'll crucify us.
{120327}{120345}Shit.
{120352}{120420}What did you decide?|What are we going to do?
{120427}{120490}Get back into the trench.|Pretend to be busy.
{120499}{120567}- We've got to buy ourselves some time.|- Excuse me to repeat...
{120569}{120629}Get back into the trench!
{120665}{120700}That's an order.
{121251}{121292}Captain, what's happening?
{121294}{121371}The mine disposal expert|has begun his job.
{121379}{121473}You will be informed|as soon as he will be finished.
{121485}{121561}- I think it's going to take a little while.|- Can we approach?
{121563}{121653}Unfortunately, for security reasons,|I cannot allow that.
{121655}{121715}You wanted to kill me with my own knife?
{121725}{121749}Oh, shit.
{121756}{121790}Quick! Tom!
{121795}{121847}Is that how you thank me?
{121871}{121908}Don't come any closer!
{121937}{121969}You're all the same!
{121971}{122021}And you vultures film it?
{122030}{122106}You get good money?|Does our misery pay well?
{122138}{122162}No!
{122629}{122673}- Did you get it?|- Yes.
{122868}{122940}Captain? Over here, please.
{123297}{123326}What do you think...
{123328}{123364}Take it easy.
{123412}{123443}<i>Listen...</i>
{123476}{123527}There was no other solution.
{123548}{123623}Marchand! Put the bodies in the car.|We're going.
{123636}{123710}- What's happening?|- The mine expert's defused it.
{123722}{123759}- He has?|- Yes.
{124639}{124683}Colonel, sir,|can we just have a few questions?
{124703}{124792}Ladies and gentleman, what can I say?|You see the conditions we work under.
{124794}{124856}Our focus now must be|on the remaining soldier.
{124858}{124912}We hope to be able to save|at least one life.
{124921}{124979}- Can we come closer? Can we film it?|- Eventually.
{124980}{125065}He's in critical condition and has to be|taken to a hospital immediately.
{125072}{125171}When he's in a fit state to answer|your questions, you'll be informed.
{125188}{125296}The press conference tonight|at 22:00 at the Holiday Inn...
{125305}{125384}...at which time I shall be happy to answer|any of your questions.
{125385}{125473}For the time being, I must ask you please|to prepare to leave the field...
{125475}{125568}...since I can no longer guarantee|your safety. Night is beginning to fall.
{125575}{125637}Please, ladies and gentlemen,|prepare to go.
{125683}{125715}Thank you.
{126515}{126580}- What's going on?|- We took out the mine expert's gear.
{126581}{126666}- What about him?|- If you have an idea, let me know.
{126668}{126748}- We can't leave him there!|- You have a solution?
{126789}{126838}You heard the mine expert.
{126909}{126958}I hope you understand now.
{126967}{127036}It's not our business, so we stay out of it.
{127061}{127135}Everything all right, Captain?|Good work, gentlemen.
{127161}{127200}I'm very pleased.
{127203}{127295}I have no doubt that in the fullness of time|you'll be duly compensated.
{127561}{127617}You've got the contact numbers|from Dubois?
{127632}{127700}Call them, will you,|and notify them that they're dead.
{127722}{127794}Then I'd like you to notify each side...
{127796}{127861}...that we have information|that the other side...
{127863}{127936}...is planning to commandeer|the central trench this evening.
{127997}{128099}Could you call me the liaison|of the Bosnians, please? Thank you.
{128188}{128264}- Well, see you round.|- See you.
{128312}{128360}I wanted to thank you.
{128436}{128499}- You got your report.|- Yes.
{128585}{128621}Are you okay?
{128653}{128699}- Ready to go?|- Sorry?
{128703}{128747}- Are you ready to go?|- Yes.
{128749}{128805}Let's not hang around, let's go.
{128848}{128914}- I hope we meet again.|- I hope so.
{128927}{128998}Remember the press conference tonight,|22:00, all right?
{129001}{129028}Yes.
{129138}{129192}I know what you're thinking, Sergeant.
{129207}{129304}It wouldn't make any difference, you know.|It wouldn't change anything.
{129347}{129381}Off you go.
{129518}{129587}Are you sure you don't want me|to film the trench?
{129629}{129721}No. A trench is a trench.|They're all the same.
