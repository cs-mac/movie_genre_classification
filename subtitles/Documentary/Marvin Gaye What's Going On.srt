3
00:03:10,554 --> 00:03:11,850
Janine?

4
00:03:11,955 --> 00:03:13,650
I Wonder how Iing I'II have
to wait

5
00:03:13,757 --> 00:03:16,419
because I Ieft Aunt Ruth
with Dad.

6
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,687
You'II see Dr. WaIIy.

7
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:20,524
Dr. Surabh is on vacation.

8
00:03:20,663 --> 00:03:22,426
See Dr. who?

9
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,500
Dear Dr. WaIIy, I quit.

10
00:03:33,242 --> 00:03:34,106
I'II be right back.

11
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:40,344
I'II teII you,
needIes bother me aIone

12
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:44,114
Augustina couId I have your arm?

13
00:03:44,621 --> 00:03:46,588
May I caII you Augustina?

14
00:03:46,689 --> 00:03:47,816
My name's Bessie.

15
00:03:47,925 --> 00:03:49,687
Bessie! I'm sorry.

16
00:03:49,826 --> 00:03:53,263
It's been a bit hectic here.

17
00:03:55,098 --> 00:03:56,794
Where's the what 'cha-ma-caII-it?

18
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,729
The tourniquet?

19
00:03:57,835 --> 00:03:59,132
That's it.

20
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,068
I'm sitting on it.

21
00:04:05,141 --> 00:04:07,042
UsuaIIy Dr. Surabh
sees the patients.

22
00:04:09,545 --> 00:04:10,604
I'm a pathoIogist.

23
00:04:11,215 --> 00:04:14,741
I bring Dad and Aunt Ruth in
to Dr. Sarabh.

24
00:04:14,852 --> 00:04:18,288
I've seen your father.
He's a very fraiI man?

25
00:04:18,388 --> 00:04:19,081
Dad's a bone.

26
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:22,783
I hope they're aII right for now.

27
00:04:22,892 --> 00:04:23,654
They're fine.

28
00:04:23,793 --> 00:04:24,692
Good.

29
00:04:25,161 --> 00:04:25,992
Except Dad's dying.

30
00:04:26,562 --> 00:04:28,656
He's been dying for 20 years,

31
00:04:28,798 --> 00:04:31,199
doing it reaI sIow
so I don't miss a thing.

32
00:04:31,735 --> 00:04:35,728
Dr. Surabh has worked a miracIe
with Aunt Ruth.

33
00:04:35,838 --> 00:04:38,865
She's had back pain since
she was born.

34
00:04:38,975 --> 00:04:42,810
But he had her get this
eIectronic anesthetizer.

35
00:04:42,913 --> 00:04:45,745
You put the wires right
to your brain.

36
00:04:45,848 --> 00:04:48,579
Anytime she has pain
she just turns the diaI.

37
00:04:48,685 --> 00:04:50,151
That's wonderfuI.

38
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:54,079
Any time she uses it our
automatic garage door goes up,

39
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,420
but that's a smaII price to pay.

40
00:04:56,526 --> 00:04:58,255
I agree.

41
00:04:59,028 --> 00:04:59,927
Are those aII for me?

42
00:05:00,497 --> 00:05:03,523
Yes, Dr. Surabh gave me
specific instructions.

43
00:05:07,704 --> 00:05:08,898
That seems Iike a Iot of bIood.

44
00:05:09,572 --> 00:05:12,939
It is Iot of bIood,
so what you're feeIing is normaI.

45
00:05:15,211 --> 00:05:16,144
Why don't we get this over with?

46
00:05:18,682 --> 00:05:19,444
This is seaIed so it's steriIe.

47
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:27,855
I think I'II come back Iater.

48
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:30,016
It's just a vitamin deficiency,
right?

49
00:05:31,528 --> 00:05:34,223
I said it might be a vitamin
deficiency.

50
00:07:41,124 --> 00:07:41,920
Good evening, Bruno's.

51
00:07:43,293 --> 00:07:43,815
HoId, pIease.

52
00:07:44,728 --> 00:07:45,285
Lee!

53
00:07:45,762 --> 00:07:46,285
What?

54
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,158
TeIephone!

55
00:07:50,867 --> 00:07:51,595
It feeIs so hard!

56
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:55,529
Don't touch it.

57
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,771
why put your hands in your hair
unIess you're nervous?

58
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:01,935
There's no reason to be nervous,
ever,

59
00:08:02,045 --> 00:08:04,343
if you have a positive
mentaI attitude.

60
00:08:11,954 --> 00:08:12,478
Switch!

61
00:08:15,024 --> 00:08:16,014
QuietIy!

62
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,625
Yeah.

63
00:08:20,797 --> 00:08:21,593
Yeah?

64
00:08:28,338 --> 00:08:29,565
Excuse me , where do you --?

65
00:08:30,007 --> 00:08:31,031
Where do you take the --?

66
00:08:33,643 --> 00:08:34,631
Where's your brother?

67
00:08:34,745 --> 00:08:35,609
He started it.

68
00:09:01,504 --> 00:09:04,633
When we heard it broke our hearts

69
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,840
You can make it your own untiI

70
00:09:12,948 --> 00:09:14,075
you get on your feet.

71
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:22,884
Do you have any reIatives?

72
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,388
No. WeII, my boys.

73
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:29,192
No reIatives.
That can be a bIessing.

74
00:09:30,167 --> 00:09:32,965
No! PIease, Lance! Don't!

75
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:37,506
No, Lance, don't!

76
00:09:38,575 --> 00:09:40,167
Stop! I'm warning you!

77
00:09:44,147 --> 00:09:45,273
You disgust me.

78
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:49,317
We didn't make Iove we had sex.

79
00:09:50,187 --> 00:09:51,017
Like animaIs.

80
00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:53,577
Like pets.

81
00:09:58,894 --> 00:09:59,485
Hi, honey.

82
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:02,620
Lance just raped CoraI.

83
00:10:02,765 --> 00:10:04,630
I am surprised,

84
00:10:04,734 --> 00:10:07,702
because CoraI performed the
surgery on him

85
00:10:07,837 --> 00:10:09,828
that got his sight back.

86
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,837
CoraI's a doctor?

87
00:10:10,941 --> 00:10:16,004
Has been for weeks now and does
that ever make Amber jeaIous!

88
00:10:16,645 --> 00:10:17,772
Did you give Dad his 2 o'cIock?

89
00:10:19,014 --> 00:10:20,208
I was going to.

90
00:10:20,884 --> 00:10:21,475
Ruth!

91
00:10:22,751 --> 00:10:24,413
I asked you to do one
IittIe thing!

92
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:32,618
AII right , aII right. Open.

93
00:10:33,163 --> 00:10:33,924
Open up.

94
00:10:37,033 --> 00:10:40,024
You've sucked aII the ink
off the Yahtzee dice.

95
00:10:40,169 --> 00:10:41,831
How are we going to pIay?

96
00:10:41,937 --> 00:10:43,166
Huh, Dad ?AII right.

97
00:10:44,407 --> 00:10:45,304
Are you okay?

98
00:10:48,378 --> 00:10:49,366
Is this his 1 o'cIock?

99
00:10:51,681 --> 00:10:52,705
Stupid me

100
00:10:53,182 --> 00:10:55,116
I'm so useIess.

101
00:10:55,451 --> 00:10:56,418
No, you're not.

102
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:58,510
Come on, quit hogging the bed.

103
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:01,519
It's my cure.

104
00:11:02,024 --> 00:11:04,390
You used to bIame the pain
and now you bIame the cure.

105
00:11:05,162 --> 00:11:05,719
Open.

106
00:11:06,663 --> 00:11:07,754
That's right. Good.

107
00:11:08,398 --> 00:11:12,356
What happened?

108
00:11:12,501 --> 00:11:13,298
The doctor took bIood.

109
00:11:13,403 --> 00:11:16,496
It Iooks tender.
ShouIdn't you see a doctor?

110
00:11:16,605 --> 00:11:19,438
I did . I have a vitamin deficiency.

111
00:11:19,543 --> 00:11:21,807
You don't make stinky enough.

112
00:11:21,912 --> 00:11:23,277
I do so !

113
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:24,937
Stinky is poison!

114
00:11:25,048 --> 00:11:26,538
You have to get rid of it .

115
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:31,485
When you're constipated
you get a headache.

116
00:11:31,587 --> 00:11:34,557
He needs his piIIs
at the same time.

117
00:11:34,658 --> 00:11:36,990
You usuaIIy give Marvin his piIIs

118
00:11:37,126 --> 00:11:39,687
But today I asked you to!

119
00:11:39,828 --> 00:11:41,659
You shouIdn't Ieave me aIone.

120
00:11:41,764 --> 00:11:44,734
What if he tries to kiII himseIf
with Parcheesi men?

121
00:11:44,868 --> 00:11:49,464
he puts thing in his mouth

122
00:11:49,572 --> 00:11:51,472
because he Iikes the way
they feeI.

123
00:11:51,575 --> 00:11:54,975
What if he dies
whiIe you're gone?

124
00:11:56,145 --> 00:11:59,376
Then you'II caII me,
and I'II come home

125
00:12:02,351 --> 00:12:04,912
ShaII I make tomato soup?

126
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,784
No, you're just going
to make a mess of it.

127
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:11,519
I'II get you one of my vitamin
piIIs for your deficiency.

128
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,720
I'II get some reaI ones Iater.

129
00:12:14,297 --> 00:12:15,321
Mine are reaI.

130
00:12:15,798 --> 00:12:17,663
Do you want PebbIes or Bam-Bam?

131
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:24,763
Dad!

132
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:31,975
Wait a second.

133
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,009
I know.

134
00:12:38,288 --> 00:12:38,947
Let me do this for you.

135
00:12:40,956 --> 00:12:41,684
Look what I got , Dad.

136
00:12:42,491 --> 00:12:43,355
Look at that!

137
00:12:46,763 --> 00:12:47,490
See?

138
00:12:48,298 --> 00:12:49,322
Isn't that nice?

139
00:12:50,066 --> 00:12:52,192
Is it nice, Dad?

140
00:12:53,135 --> 00:12:53,794
What?

141
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,030
What do you see there?

142
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:03,100
is that the Northern Lights?

143
00:13:03,212 --> 00:13:04,874
You want it over there?

144
00:13:13,423 --> 00:13:20,124
Now I got you some carrots
and some butternut squash.

145
00:13:21,498 --> 00:13:24,159
AII right , then,
how about some tomato soup?

146
00:13:25,634 --> 00:13:27,261
And some juice.

147
00:13:28,203 --> 00:13:32,765
And what does that face mean
Mr. Innocent?

148
00:13:42,351 --> 00:13:43,341
You mind if I smoke?

149
00:13:44,287 --> 00:13:45,150
Yes.

150
00:13:46,221 --> 00:13:47,188
Thank you for asking.

151
00:13:48,091 --> 00:13:49,820
How about if I bIow it out
this way?

152
00:13:51,061 --> 00:13:53,052
There's no smoking on this fIoor.

153
00:13:53,897 --> 00:13:55,557
Okay, I'II be reaI quiet.

154
00:14:01,571 --> 00:14:02,697
It's good to see you here, Lee.

155
00:14:03,873 --> 00:14:04,804
May I caII you Lee?

156
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:05,966
Sure.

157
00:14:06,775 --> 00:14:09,176
We've missed you other days.
So has Hank.

158
00:14:11,347 --> 00:14:12,610
I'm sorry .

159
00:14:12,716 --> 00:14:17,153
I with I couId visit more often,
but you know.

160
00:14:23,293 --> 00:14:24,554
you're not a nurse, are you?

161
00:14:25,327 --> 00:14:26,351
I'm a psychiatrist.

162
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,229
You're the one Hank taIks to.

163
00:14:28,331 --> 00:14:30,423
I'm in charge of his therapy.

164
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,660
You know he Iies.

165
00:14:35,904 --> 00:14:39,067
He toId his schooI counseIor
that I beat him.

166
00:14:41,778 --> 00:14:43,005
So, see what I mean?

167
00:14:51,187 --> 00:14:53,154
You're thinking,
''I wonder if she does beat him?''

168
00:14:54,224 --> 00:14:55,282
You think I think that?

169
00:14:55,924 --> 00:14:56,515
Don't you?

170
00:14:57,192 --> 00:14:58,716
Do you want me to think that?

171
00:14:59,361 --> 00:15:00,350
What do you mean?

172
00:15:00,496 --> 00:15:01,861
What do you think I mean?

173
00:15:01,965 --> 00:15:04,490
What do you mean,
''What do I think you mean?''

174
00:15:04,634 --> 00:15:08,034
What do you think I mean by,
' What do you think I mean?''

175
00:15:08,971 --> 00:15:14,432
We want you invoIved in Hank's
therapy to visit more often.

176
00:15:14,543 --> 00:15:16,739
Doctor, can I be honest with you?

177
00:15:18,815 --> 00:15:20,783
I have forced my way
through schooI,

178
00:15:20,884 --> 00:15:22,851
and I'm about to get my degree.

179
00:15:22,951 --> 00:15:26,649
And I'm picky now about the kind
of guy I'II go with.

180
00:15:26,755 --> 00:15:31,921
And I keep... used to keep...
a reaIIy cIean house.

181
00:15:32,061 --> 00:15:34,586
Hank makes fun of my degree

182
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:38,394
in cosmetoIogy he terrorizes
any guy I go out with.

183
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:38,990
This Iast one,

184
00:15:39,134 --> 00:15:41,000
Hank made fun of his being
on paroIe

185
00:15:41,104 --> 00:15:44,562
he made fun of how he hoIds
his Iiquor, of his Pinto!

186
00:15:45,174 --> 00:15:49,736
Hank cost me a potentiaIIy
good reIationship.

187
00:15:49,846 --> 00:15:51,073
And as for my house..

188
00:15:56,251 --> 00:15:58,846
Hank is not something
I can controI.

189
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:02,621
What's the point of visiting?

190
00:16:03,927 --> 00:16:04,916
He says he misses you.

191
00:16:09,131 --> 00:16:11,032
I'm here . So Iet me see him.

192
00:16:16,572 --> 00:16:17,197
You want one?

193
00:16:36,993 --> 00:16:38,961
Hi, Hank. It's Mom.

194
00:16:39,062 --> 00:16:40,028
Can you hear me?

195
00:16:48,705 --> 00:16:50,899
You be good.
I'II Ieave some of these.

196
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,109
So when you wake you can
have them.

197
00:16:59,182 --> 00:17:00,979
Okay, weII, I'II see you.

198
00:17:07,257 --> 00:17:08,348
Does this count as a visit?

199
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,424
Do you think this counts
as a visit?

200
00:17:26,442 --> 00:17:27,670
Excuse me.

201
00:17:29,045 --> 00:17:31,104
Dr . WaIIy may be Iate.

202
00:17:31,713 --> 00:17:34,342
He was an 1 1-month baby.

203
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:36,441
I was premature.

204
00:17:36,553 --> 00:17:37,541
Sorry to have kept you waiting .

205
00:17:37,653 --> 00:17:39,019
I got stuck at the hospitaI.

206
00:17:39,122 --> 00:17:40,919
You must be busy.

207
00:17:41,023 --> 00:17:42,286
I wanted to check on your test.

208
00:17:42,392 --> 00:17:44,723
I weighed one pound at birth.

209
00:17:44,861 --> 00:17:46,327
No, you didn't , Bob.

210
00:17:46,461 --> 00:17:47,792
I was this big.

211
00:17:47,896 --> 00:17:49,761
FoIIow me.

212
00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:51,096
Not you ,Bob.

213
00:17:52,568 --> 00:17:53,125
FoIIow me.

214
00:17:57,507 --> 00:17:59,236
So... how are we today?

215
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:01,876
You teII me.

216
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:11,678
Dr. WaIIy speaking.

217
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:16,124
I know there's someone
in my office.

218
00:18:16,224 --> 00:18:17,782
I am in my office.

219
00:18:18,327 --> 00:18:18,952
That's aII right.

220
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:20,952
Yes.

221
00:18:25,067 --> 00:18:25,829
Is there a probIem?

222
00:18:26,635 --> 00:18:28,398
He's just new.

223
00:18:28,503 --> 00:18:30,733
he'II get the hang of it.

224
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:32,136
With my bIood test.
Did it get Iost?

225
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,506
Because I was getting aII
worked up

226
00:18:35,612 --> 00:18:38,375
thinking horribIe thoughts.

227
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,378
It's not Iost.

228
00:18:39,481 --> 00:18:43,976
I wouId Iike to run other tests,
to ruIe out some possibiIities.

229
00:18:44,787 --> 00:18:45,878
What possibiIities?

230
00:18:46,489 --> 00:18:48,251
Some I wouId Iike to ruIe out.

231
00:18:48,357 --> 00:18:49,950
Do I have a vitamin deficiency?

232
00:18:50,093 --> 00:18:52,891
We've ruIed that out.

233
00:18:53,028 --> 00:18:54,690
ShouId we ruIe that out?

234
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,298
Don't be nervous.

235
00:18:56,432 --> 00:18:57,160
I'm not nervous.

236
00:18:57,266 --> 00:18:58,163
Good.

237
00:18:58,267 --> 00:19:00,701
I'm going to give a IocaI
anesthetic

238
00:19:00,803 --> 00:19:04,203
and remove bone marrow
from your hip.

239
00:19:04,307 --> 00:19:05,103
What?!

240
00:19:06,942 --> 00:19:09,502
Not to be nosy, but what's
the test for?

241
00:19:09,612 --> 00:19:11,546
Iet me do the worrying.

242
00:19:12,414 --> 00:19:16,214
I'm thinking it's worse
than it is.

243
00:19:18,121 --> 00:19:20,316
Is it serious,
Iike a brain tumor?

244
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:21,854
Oh, no.

245
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,023
M.S.?

246
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,490
No.

247
00:19:25,627 --> 00:19:26,924
Cancer?

248
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,958
One of the possibiIities

249
00:19:32,101 --> 00:19:33,659
I was hoping to ruIe out
is Ieukemia.

250
00:19:35,904 --> 00:19:36,769
My mother had--

251
00:19:39,442 --> 00:19:40,238
I know.

252
00:19:41,044 --> 00:19:42,135
I saw that in your fiIe.

253
00:19:50,019 --> 00:19:50,986
HoId aII my caIIs, pIease.

254
00:19:56,792 --> 00:19:58,124
Bessie, I just--

255
00:20:03,598 --> 00:20:04,462
Dr. WaIIy speaking.

256
00:20:05,902 --> 00:20:08,132
Yes that was me.

257
00:20:08,237 --> 00:20:10,671
Didn't you recognize my voice,
Bob?

258
00:20:10,772 --> 00:20:11,500
That's aII right.

259
00:20:13,476 --> 00:20:14,840
That's what I get for hiring
my brother.

260
00:20:16,979 --> 00:20:19,378
I haven't feIt as bad IateIy,
not nearIy as tired.

261
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:25,053
Lie on your side , face the waII
and we'II get this over with soon

262
00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:35,020
What does it mean
if it's Ieukemia?

263
00:20:37,967 --> 00:20:41,163
There are a variety of Ieukemias
and a variety of treatments.

264
00:20:42,171 --> 00:20:43,068
If you have,

265
00:20:43,172 --> 00:20:49,076
for exampIe chronic myeIogenous
Ieukemia a bone marrow transpIant

266
00:20:49,178 --> 00:20:50,041
is a reaI option.

267
00:20:50,145 --> 00:20:53,308
We wouId test famiIy members
for possibIe donors.

268
00:20:53,415 --> 00:20:54,347
You do have famiIy.

269
00:20:55,117 --> 00:20:56,243
dad and Ruth.

270
00:20:56,352 --> 00:20:57,614
Your fiIe mentioned a sister.

271
00:20:58,354 --> 00:21:00,617
Yes, I do... I...

272
00:21:00,722 --> 00:21:02,247
I have a sister, Lee.

273
00:21:03,859 --> 00:21:04,326
Good.

274
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:35,779
I just had it done Iast week
and it's driving me crazy.

275
00:21:36,224 --> 00:21:40,320
Is God punishing me for vanity,
or is it aIways that way?

276
00:21:42,198 --> 00:21:43,688
If you have a permanent
done right

277
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:45,130
it shouIdn't itch you at aII.

278
00:21:46,635 --> 00:21:47,761
Convent.

279
00:21:48,171 --> 00:21:48,796
Convent?

280
00:21:50,605 --> 00:21:52,800
Sister Lee Lacker, pIease.

281
00:21:54,009 --> 00:21:56,705
Sister Lee Lacker teIephone.

282
00:22:07,256 --> 00:22:07,744
HeIIo?

283
00:22:13,296 --> 00:22:13,853
Lee?

284
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:17,094
Hi, it's me, Bessie.

285
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,525
Bessie?

286
00:22:19,634 --> 00:22:20,363
What's wrong?

287
00:22:37,252 --> 00:22:39,049
They had reservations about
Ietting Hank go.

288
00:22:39,154 --> 00:22:41,349
A week is aII we couId get.

289
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:43,255
But if one of us is a match--

290
00:22:43,358 --> 00:22:44,416
We'II deaI with that then.

291
00:22:48,196 --> 00:22:48,685
Hey.

292
00:22:49,664 --> 00:22:50,289
Look at you.

293
00:22:51,334 --> 00:22:52,392
You Iook Iike a pig.

294
00:22:52,535 --> 00:22:53,933
I'm working on an engine.

295
00:22:54,036 --> 00:22:55,127
They don't Iet you shower?

296
00:22:56,005 --> 00:22:57,996
They toId me you were here,
so I came.

297
00:23:02,478 --> 00:23:03,501
You behaving , yourseIf?

298
00:23:05,248 --> 00:23:07,010
They're not strapping me
down anymore.

299
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:09,106
Don't abuse that priviIege.

300
00:23:11,019 --> 00:23:12,112
How come you're visiting me?

301
00:23:12,855 --> 00:23:14,846
I don't need a reason to visit .

302
00:23:15,124 --> 00:23:15,852
You never visited before.

303
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:18,050
I did . you were unconscious.

304
00:23:18,193 --> 00:23:19,490
it doesn't count. I didn't know.

305
00:23:19,628 --> 00:23:22,996
Conscious or not,
I made the effort.

306
00:23:23,633 --> 00:23:25,498
Your mother has news.

307
00:23:25,601 --> 00:23:27,228
It's not good news.

308
00:23:30,038 --> 00:23:30,630
But...

309
00:23:31,106 --> 00:23:33,439
Doctor says it's okay to teII you

310
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:35,806
because partiaIIy I have
no choice.

311
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:38,008
what?

312
00:23:39,582 --> 00:23:43,244
Your Aunt Bessie has Ieukemia.
She's not doing weII.

313
00:23:43,352 --> 00:23:45,080
She might die.

314
00:23:46,188 --> 00:23:47,484
I didn't know I had an
Aunt Bessie.

315
00:23:48,457 --> 00:23:49,583
She 's been to the house.

316
00:23:49,692 --> 00:23:50,521
When?

317
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:52,457
Right after your dad
and I married.

318
00:23:52,994 --> 00:23:54,121
Mom, I wasn't born yet.

319
00:23:54,864 --> 00:23:57,298
I know I mentioned my sister.

320
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,798
I didn't know about her.

321
00:23:58,901 --> 00:24:00,993
Every goddamn Christmas I say ,

322
00:24:01,103 --> 00:24:03,594
''Bessie didn't send a card again
either.''

323
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,538
Oh, Yeah.

324
00:24:05,641 --> 00:24:06,732
That's your Aunt Bessie.

325
00:24:06,842 --> 00:24:07,773
My sister.

326
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:11,207
As her reIatives,
they want to test us

327
00:24:11,314 --> 00:24:14,181
maybe save her Iife with a bone
marrow transpIant--

328
00:24:14,282 --> 00:24:15,307
It's onIy a week.

329
00:24:15,417 --> 00:24:16,442
Doctor says it's okay to go .

330
00:24:17,185 --> 00:24:18,174
Why wouId I want to go ?

331
00:24:21,723 --> 00:24:23,281
Because one of us might
save her Iife.

332
00:24:26,127 --> 00:24:27,788
Go cIean up.

333
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:30,228
I'm not going to take you
Iike that.

334
00:24:32,468 --> 00:24:34,935
Isn't there something you want
to say?

335
00:24:36,338 --> 00:24:38,203
WiII this take Iong? We shouId go

336
00:24:39,141 --> 00:24:43,942
Mom I'm sorry I burned
the house down.

337
00:24:49,518 --> 00:24:53,113
Is that it? Because I'm reaIIy
anxious to get on the road.

338
00:25:16,378 --> 00:25:17,141
No matches.

339
00:25:18,213 --> 00:25:19,374
I've got to Iight the thing.

340
00:25:20,016 --> 00:25:22,108
CharIie Iight this for him ,
pIease.

341
00:25:46,174 --> 00:25:50,474
Being confined to your bed
is nothing to be afraid of.

342
00:25:50,578 --> 00:25:52,843
I'm not confined to my bed,
I'm just

343
00:25:53,516 --> 00:25:54,846
I'm tired today.

344
00:25:55,483 --> 00:25:58,009
I was confined to bed most
of my Iife.

345
00:25:58,119 --> 00:25:59,883
You find things to do.

346
00:26:00,388 --> 00:26:01,320
Like what?

347
00:26:04,894 --> 00:26:08,590
You can sIeep...
or you can Iay there awake.

348
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,758
you want this?

349
00:26:13,269 --> 00:26:16,135
You must eat aII of that to make
yourseIf strong.

350
00:26:18,307 --> 00:26:19,035
How's Dad?

351
00:26:19,541 --> 00:26:20,667
He's fine.

352
00:26:23,144 --> 00:26:24,202
Do you want your orange?

353
00:26:25,614 --> 00:26:26,637
You can have it.

354
00:26:26,749 --> 00:26:27,875
Not if you're going--

355
00:26:28,584 --> 00:26:29,346
Thank you.

356
00:26:31,086 --> 00:26:32,348
Does he miss me?

357
00:26:34,757 --> 00:26:37,248
I haven't actuaIIy toId him
you're gone.

358
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,525
Doesn't he wonder where I am?

359
00:26:40,096 --> 00:26:44,031
I teII him you're just in the
other room busy with something

360
00:26:44,165 --> 00:26:45,997
then he faIIs asIeep.

361
00:26:46,102 --> 00:26:49,127
and when he wakes I say he just
missed you.

362
00:26:49,238 --> 00:26:50,898
Who does he think that nurse is?

363
00:26:51,473 --> 00:26:53,031
I pretend not to notice her.

364
00:26:53,142 --> 00:26:54,301
What do you mean?

365
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:56,741
If she waIks in the room
when I'm there...

366
00:26:56,846 --> 00:27:00,713
I pretend that she doesn't exist.

367
00:27:00,816 --> 00:27:03,875
What does Dad think ?

368
00:27:03,986 --> 00:27:07,615
I think he thinks
he's haIIucinating.

369
00:27:08,523 --> 00:27:09,455
You have to teII him.

370
00:27:09,991 --> 00:27:14,951
The onIy time it bothers him is
when she carries him to the bath

371
00:27:15,096 --> 00:27:18,759
and I say, ''OH, Marvin, Iook,
you're fIying!

372
00:27:19,768 --> 00:27:23,795
Bessie'II want to see this,
''and I run to get you.

373
00:27:24,405 --> 00:27:26,067
He must think he's going mad.

374
00:27:26,509 --> 00:27:27,839
What am I supposed to teII him?

375
00:27:30,746 --> 00:27:32,737
That his IittIe girI is.

376
00:27:35,284 --> 00:27:37,615
Then he'd reaIIy think he was
Iosing his mind.

377
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:42,056
It wouId be so upsetting to him.

378
00:27:42,157 --> 00:27:43,785
He's your father.

379
00:27:43,893 --> 00:27:44,722
AII right , Ruth.

380
00:27:44,859 --> 00:27:46,794
I wouIdn't know what to say.

381
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:49,593
Here.

382
00:27:57,506 --> 00:27:59,029
TeII him I'm going to be fine.

383
00:27:59,642 --> 00:28:00,506
I know I am.

384
00:28:02,443 --> 00:28:03,536
See?

385
00:28:06,414 --> 00:28:07,472
That's okay. Sure.

386
00:28:11,987 --> 00:28:13,010
What is Grandpa Iike?

387
00:28:14,289 --> 00:28:16,280
I don't know , CharIie.
It's been a whiIe.

388
00:28:16,991 --> 00:28:18,391
Why haven't we seen him before?

389
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:21,790
He's been sick. We were in Ohio.

390
00:28:21,931 --> 00:28:23,955
It's hard to traveI
with IittIe kids.

391
00:28:25,601 --> 00:28:26,396
What's Bessie Iike?

392
00:28:31,207 --> 00:28:32,037
I don't know.

393
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:36,435
This is the first I've heard
from her in 20 years.

394
00:28:36,545 --> 00:28:39,275
Why haven't you heard from her?

395
00:28:39,748 --> 00:28:42,944
I couIdn't heIp her when Dad got
sick and she got mad at me.

396
00:28:43,051 --> 00:28:43,711
Why?

397
00:28:43,818 --> 00:28:47,049
Jesus! Shut up! Read your book.

398
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,401
You ever heard of Larry Lacker?

399
00:29:06,508 --> 00:29:06,973
Who?

400
00:29:07,076 --> 00:29:09,977
My dad. He's the greatest race
car driver ever.

401
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,039
No, I never heard of Larry Lacker

402
00:29:20,321 --> 00:29:21,220
Those guys know Dad.

403
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:31,689
hi.

404
00:29:32,768 --> 00:29:33,757
Bessie.

405
00:29:55,324 --> 00:29:56,221
Come on. Iet's go.

406
00:29:56,325 --> 00:29:58,588
I was Iistening to that!

407
00:30:17,211 --> 00:30:17,769
heIIo?

408
00:30:48,711 --> 00:30:50,076
God. What are you staring at?

409
00:30:53,082 --> 00:30:55,811
My goodness! Look at you !

410
00:30:55,917 --> 00:30:56,906
What ?

411
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,277
Just Iook at you!

412
00:30:59,121 --> 00:31:00,849
Oh, God, are you that oId?

413
00:31:01,323 --> 00:31:02,653
How oId does that make me?

414
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,057
Why , I Iook oId?

415
00:31:07,229 --> 00:31:10,288
You're a Iot oIder...but--

416
00:31:12,201 --> 00:31:15,192
You Iook reaIIy good, though,
Bessie.

417
00:31:15,738 --> 00:31:16,602
I Iike your hair.

418
00:31:18,006 --> 00:31:20,873
This is a wig. It's from my chemo

419
00:31:25,681 --> 00:31:26,739
I know it's a wig.

420
00:31:26,848 --> 00:31:28,476
I don't know why I pretended
not to.

421
00:31:29,151 --> 00:31:30,277
Not that is Iooks Iike a wig.

422
00:31:34,222 --> 00:31:35,747
I'm wearing a faII. Look.

423
00:31:36,325 --> 00:31:37,222
See?

424
00:31:37,326 --> 00:31:38,486
I Iove the Iength,

425
00:31:38,626 --> 00:31:40,059
but I don't have the patience
for it,

426
00:31:40,162 --> 00:31:42,186
I just wear it when I want to
Iook great.

427
00:31:44,432 --> 00:31:45,457
You Iook good. though.

428
00:31:48,269 --> 00:31:48,826
Thank you.

429
00:31:52,207 --> 00:31:53,605
Sit down.

430
00:31:53,709 --> 00:31:56,734
I've got to soak these.
Dad had an accident.

431
00:31:58,846 --> 00:31:59,403
How is he?

432
00:32:01,048 --> 00:32:02,106
He's stiII with us.

433
00:32:02,683 --> 00:32:03,412
Let me heIp.

434
00:32:03,818 --> 00:32:05,012
Oh , no.

435
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:05,778
You sure?

436
00:32:05,887 --> 00:32:07,115
I've been doing it this Iong.

437
00:32:30,378 --> 00:32:31,073
Daddy?

438
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,577
It's me.

439
00:32:33,582 --> 00:32:34,309
Lee

440
00:32:35,349 --> 00:32:37,010
AII the way down from Ohio.

441
00:33:21,329 --> 00:33:23,298
You shouIdn't smoke in the house.

442
00:33:23,999 --> 00:33:25,364
Dad's oxygen tanks.

443
00:33:26,067 --> 00:33:27,160
You can smoke in the yard.

444
00:33:28,036 --> 00:33:28,900
I don't have to smoke.

445
00:33:32,307 --> 00:33:33,398
Oh, Iook who it is!

446
00:33:33,942 --> 00:33:35,000
Aunt Ruth!

447
00:33:35,109 --> 00:33:35,837
You're up and about!

448
00:33:36,377 --> 00:33:38,710
It's my cure. I'm part machine.

449
00:33:40,816 --> 00:33:41,612
Are you going to give me a hug?

450
00:33:43,986 --> 00:33:46,215
Give me a reaI hug.
I won't break!

451
00:33:50,358 --> 00:33:52,554
Oh, sweet Jesus!

452
00:34:02,203 --> 00:34:03,296
That's much better.

453
00:34:05,941 --> 00:34:07,238
I brought cookies.

454
00:34:07,675 --> 00:34:08,972
Thanks, Lee.

455
00:34:09,077 --> 00:34:10,635
Dad and Ruth can't have sugar,

456
00:34:10,746 --> 00:34:15,376
and I stay away from it too thins
is just a IoveIy canister.

457
00:34:16,784 --> 00:34:18,184
Oh, I'm missing my program.

458
00:34:21,722 --> 00:34:22,690
You go watch your program.

459
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,619
Where are your boys?

460
00:34:27,628 --> 00:34:30,427
Did Hank get out of the mentaI
institution?

461
00:34:30,532 --> 00:34:32,762
We don't Iike to caII it that .

462
00:34:32,867 --> 00:34:33,960
What do you caII it?

463
00:34:34,068 --> 00:34:37,800
The nut house or Ioony bin,
to show we have a sense of humor

464
00:34:39,041 --> 00:34:40,474
where is he ? Where's CharIey?

465
00:34:40,576 --> 00:34:42,702
I've got two nephews
I've never seen!

466
00:34:43,177 --> 00:34:47,307
I did invite you to Ohio for both
their christenings.

467
00:34:48,317 --> 00:34:49,284
They're in the car.

468
00:34:50,918 --> 00:34:51,646
The car?

469
00:34:55,724 --> 00:34:58,989
Hank wiII do things Iike this
just to get attention.

470
00:34:59,695 --> 00:35:02,664
They say to ignore it ,
or give him an uItimatum.

471
00:35:03,965 --> 00:35:05,762
He hasn't agreed to be tested

472
00:35:05,867 --> 00:35:07,960
because it makes him the center
of attention.

473
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:08,626
He hasn't ?

474
00:35:08,737 --> 00:35:09,862
No.

475
00:35:09,972 --> 00:35:11,768
Don't worry. He wiII.

476
00:35:11,873 --> 00:35:13,773
I'II make him, if I have to.

477
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:17,333
How You can't make him come
in from the car.

478
00:35:26,588 --> 00:35:29,853
Hey, you two! What the heII
are you doing?

479
00:35:29,958 --> 00:35:32,653
I want to hear # 1 of the top
1 00 countdown.

480
00:35:32,793 --> 00:35:34,260
What are they on?

481
00:35:34,396 --> 00:35:35,623
86!

482
00:35:42,036 --> 00:35:46,474
I'm warning you! Get out of
the car now!

483
00:35:55,951 --> 00:35:57,349
Hi, I'm Aunt Bessie,

484
00:35:57,452 --> 00:36:01,547
who you never Iaid eyes on
I don't care how grown you are,

485
00:36:01,657 --> 00:36:02,918
I expect a hug.

486
00:36:13,934 --> 00:36:15,128
And you must be CharIie?

487
00:36:16,672 --> 00:36:19,572
Look who's here! Look who's here

488
00:36:20,909 --> 00:36:23,934
This is your Aunt Ruth. Come on,
say heIIo.

489
00:36:24,045 --> 00:36:29,780
He's excited about meeting you.

490
00:36:31,485 --> 00:36:33,385
Let me get him ready.

491
00:36:38,293 --> 00:36:41,820
He wants to make a good
impression.

492
00:36:41,963 --> 00:36:44,954
Marvin, company's coming!

493
00:37:12,027 --> 00:37:16,190
Wake up!

494
00:37:16,331 --> 00:37:18,822
This is Lee... your daughter.

495
00:37:19,568 --> 00:37:21,092
And ...there's CharIie.

496
00:37:21,737 --> 00:37:22,795
Right there , see him?

497
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,907
And Hank.

498
00:37:28,909 --> 00:37:29,739
Your grandsons.

499
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:46,918
It's okay.

500
00:37:49,498 --> 00:37:51,728
He's not used to a Iot of peopIe.

501
00:37:51,833 --> 00:37:52,663
What'd you do?

502
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,257
Nothing. I said heIIo.

503
00:37:54,402 --> 00:37:57,235
Maybe we shouId cIear out.

504
00:38:01,175 --> 00:38:03,110
Give him a second. Lee?

505
00:38:27,536 --> 00:38:29,231
Were you offered chip?

506
00:38:29,336 --> 00:38:30,894
They're to eat.

507
00:38:31,005 --> 00:38:32,701
He must wait to be asked.

508
00:38:32,807 --> 00:38:34,400
Put the chip back, Hank.

509
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:39,940
Put it back.

510
00:38:49,257 --> 00:38:50,382
Put back the chip.

511
00:38:51,293 --> 00:38:53,784
I put them there for the kids.

512
00:38:54,228 --> 00:38:56,423
You must understand,
he has to wait to be asked.

513
00:39:02,704 --> 00:39:04,262
No thanks, not right now.

514
00:39:04,806 --> 00:39:08,139
The poIite thing to do wouId be
to take one.

515
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:09,735
I don't want one.

516
00:39:10,344 --> 00:39:11,641
Then no DisneyworId.

517
00:39:11,746 --> 00:39:13,407
I couId give a fuck!

518
00:39:13,514 --> 00:39:14,777
That's it! Get out!

519
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:17,184
I don't care where.
Just so I can't see you.

520
00:39:24,492 --> 00:39:25,322
WouId you Iike a chip?

521
00:39:29,364 --> 00:39:30,523
Go ahead, if you want one.

522
00:39:31,967 --> 00:39:32,695
Take a bunch.

523
00:39:33,501 --> 00:39:35,092
Not too many.
You'II ruin your supper.

524
00:39:40,976 --> 00:39:43,034
Don't get any crumb on
your aunt's fIoor.

525
00:40:07,068 --> 00:40:16,635
Not Amber, no! No, Lance,
that's Amber! No!

526
00:41:58,512 --> 00:42:00,844
I'm not used to somebody eIse
out here.

527
00:42:01,248 --> 00:42:02,409
You want me inside?

528
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:05,849
No! UnIess, are you not supposed
to be here?

529
00:42:06,588 --> 00:42:07,452
WiII your mother care?

530
00:42:07,554 --> 00:42:08,317
No.

531
00:42:08,422 --> 00:42:09,286
She's asIeep.

532
00:42:10,224 --> 00:42:11,351
I don't see any harm in it.

533
00:42:14,362 --> 00:42:15,487
We're aII gIad you're here.

534
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:18,394
We shouId do it every 1 7 years.

535
00:42:21,402 --> 00:42:24,132
Your mom and I haven't aIways
gotten aIong.

536
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:26,672
So I wasn't in touch much.

537
00:42:29,543 --> 00:42:31,670
I wish you couId have reaIIy
known your granddad.

538
00:42:33,081 --> 00:42:34,844
He wouId've Ioved having
a boy around.

539
00:42:36,851 --> 00:42:38,112
Do you ever wish he'd just die?

540
00:42:39,753 --> 00:42:40,686
Don't ask that.

541
00:42:41,389 --> 00:42:42,083
Why not?

542
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:44,181
Because... it's rude.

543
00:42:48,862 --> 00:42:50,922
I haven't decided about getting
tested.

544
00:42:55,836 --> 00:42:56,894
What're you doing with the tooIs?

545
00:42:58,106 --> 00:42:59,630
Looking. I'II put them back.

546
00:43:00,208 --> 00:43:02,574
I didn't think you'd steaI them.
Take them.

547
00:43:06,313 --> 00:43:06,905
ReaIIy?

548
00:43:07,548 --> 00:43:08,378
Sure.

549
00:43:09,818 --> 00:43:11,182
You'II give them to me?

550
00:43:11,286 --> 00:43:12,878
Sure, why not?

551
00:43:14,222 --> 00:43:15,483
They're cooI tooIs.

552
00:43:17,291 --> 00:43:18,519
They were your granddad.

553
00:43:19,427 --> 00:43:20,393
He'd Iike you to have them.

554
00:43:22,797 --> 00:43:24,594
HospitaI won't Iet me keep them.

555
00:43:26,333 --> 00:43:27,664
You won't be there forever.

556
00:43:29,536 --> 00:43:31,800
They're going to move me into
a pIace for aduIts.

557
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:33,431
Why?

558
00:43:34,041 --> 00:43:35,532
I turn 18 in three weeks.

559
00:43:37,177 --> 00:43:37,905
Happy birthday.

560
00:43:40,648 --> 00:43:44,583
If the fire hadn't spread it
wouIdn't be a big deaI.

561
00:43:44,686 --> 00:43:46,483
They're making sure I'm no threat

562
00:43:46,588 --> 00:43:49,715
You're probabIy the best.

563
00:43:49,824 --> 00:43:54,090
A dude on my fIoor heId a razor
bIade under his tongue 5 hours.

564
00:43:54,228 --> 00:43:56,628
He taIked, ate and everything.

565
00:43:56,731 --> 00:43:59,097
Why wouId he do that?

566
00:43:59,534 --> 00:44:00,592
He was trying to break my record.

567
00:44:04,806 --> 00:44:06,137
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

568
00:44:07,208 --> 00:44:08,139
I am grown up.

569
00:44:55,889 --> 00:44:57,356
Marvin Iiked to fix stuff?

570
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:01,023
He used to make your mom mad.

571
00:45:01,596 --> 00:45:03,996
He'd Ieave that radio in pieces

572
00:45:04,132 --> 00:45:06,224
and she used to Iove
to turn it up

573
00:45:06,367 --> 00:45:07,994
and dance wiId around the house.

574
00:45:09,336 --> 00:45:10,304
Mom Iiked to dance?

575
00:45:10,704 --> 00:45:11,672
You bet.

576
00:45:13,641 --> 00:45:14,505
Who's this right here?

577
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:17,704
Let me see.

578
00:45:20,347 --> 00:45:21,110
That's your grandmother.

579
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:22,809
She Iooks Iike Mom.

580
00:45:23,952 --> 00:45:25,282
Yeah, she takes after her.

581
00:45:26,688 --> 00:45:27,619
Do you want this too?

582
00:45:28,722 --> 00:45:30,054
No, I don't care.

583
00:45:31,391 --> 00:45:32,619
I'm going to keep it then.

584
00:45:35,063 --> 00:45:37,690
I don't think I'II get the test.

585
00:45:37,831 --> 00:45:38,923
Can I ask why?

586
00:45:39,067 --> 00:45:40,693
No reason.

587
00:45:44,005 --> 00:45:45,597
Maybe your mom wouIdn't want
you up so Iate.

588
00:45:48,376 --> 00:45:48,932
AII right.

589
00:45:54,748 --> 00:45:57,239
You know nobody does anything
to be nice.

590
00:45:58,385 --> 00:45:59,943
They aIways want something.

591
00:46:00,054 --> 00:46:00,748
You beIieve that?

592
00:46:00,855 --> 00:46:05,224
Yeah, you needed something.

593
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:10,126
Why do you think I spent my Iife
down here to get something?

594
00:46:10,231 --> 00:46:13,257
Or you wouIdn't have.

595
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,231
Or maybe you wanted to hide out.

596
00:46:15,335 --> 00:46:18,567
Or thought you'd never
get married.

597
00:46:18,672 --> 00:46:20,231
When you're gone, a nursing home
can do this job.

598
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:22,536
Your mother wouIdn't put them
in a home.

599
00:46:22,643 --> 00:46:24,338
Why not? She doesn't give a shit
about anybody.

1
00:46:39,553 --> 00:46:41,282
I'm putting this with your things

2
00:46:42,556 --> 00:46:43,045
Why?

3
00:46:44,658 --> 00:46:45,625
Because they're yours.

4
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:55,497
You're my nephew and I Iove you.

5
00:46:56,170 --> 00:46:57,364
No matter what you've decided. 

6
00:47:03,944 --> 00:47:04,706
Good night.

7
00:47:17,224 --> 00:47:19,692
Don't waste time making friends
with him.

8
00:47:19,827 --> 00:47:21,125
We're onIy here a few days.

9
00:47:34,975 --> 00:47:38,274
We're starting a procedure to
Iook for a match.

10
00:47:38,379 --> 00:47:40,813
PIease, Bob. I'II take this.

11
00:47:42,182 --> 00:47:44,173
We're starting a procedure to
Iook for a match.

12
00:47:45,152 --> 00:47:45,777
Questions?

13
00:47:46,487 --> 00:47:47,419
How big is the needIe?

14
00:47:49,823 --> 00:47:51,723
It's not important that you
understand.

15
00:47:51,826 --> 00:47:53,292
Bob.

16
00:47:53,394 --> 00:47:55,259
FoIIow me, pIease.

17
00:47:58,799 --> 00:47:59,993
Are you fixing the door for Ruth?

18
00:48:01,568 --> 00:48:03,433
It's so boring.
There's nothing eIse to do.

19
00:48:04,204 --> 00:48:05,330
Want to keep me company?

20
00:48:06,974 --> 00:48:07,634
Sure.

21
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:13,808
It's a Ford, huh?

22
00:48:15,349 --> 00:48:17,146
WouId you Iike to drive?

23
00:48:17,885 --> 00:48:18,614
Are you sure?

24
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:19,378
Yes

25
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,078
You want me to drive?

26
00:48:21,221 --> 00:48:23,246
It's okay, you can drive.

27
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:25,358
I'm fast, I'm warning you.

28
00:48:26,493 --> 00:48:27,960
Be carefuI. Don't go too fast.

29
00:48:42,777 --> 00:48:44,038
You're a naturaI born driver.

30
00:48:47,714 --> 00:48:49,238
I have an idea where we can go!

31
00:48:50,085 --> 00:48:50,778
Turn here.

32
00:49:00,561 --> 00:49:01,221
Do you know my dad?

33
00:49:02,062 --> 00:49:02,790
I met him once.

34
00:49:04,298 --> 00:49:05,424
Doesn't your mom taIk about him?

35
00:49:06,667 --> 00:49:07,156
No. 

36
00:49:08,135 --> 00:49:14,040
I know your mom war nuts
about him. 

37
00:49:16,477 --> 00:49:17,136
Did you go to the wedding?

38
00:49:17,611 --> 00:49:18,168
No. 

39
00:49:19,213 --> 00:49:22,980
I knew I war going to be down
here with Dad and Ruth

40
00:49:23,083 --> 00:49:25,951
so I went back home to seII
the rest of my stuff.

41
00:49:27,688 --> 00:49:29,588
Did they have you over for dinner

42
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:34,457
No, it wasn't much of a visit.
I just stopped by.

43
00:49:34,561 --> 00:49:38,588
Your dad was asIeep,
and Lee didn't want to wake him

44
00:49:38,699 --> 00:49:41,896
so we stood in the haIIway
and taIked a whiIe.

45
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:45,435
Your dad was stiII asIeep
when I Ieft.

46
00:49:47,942 --> 00:49:48,703
How'd he seem? 

47
00:49:53,547 --> 00:49:54,913
He seemed nice enough. 

48
00:50:18,105 --> 00:50:18,867
What?

49
00:51:24,671 --> 00:51:25,969
We ware just down by the water.

50
00:51:29,443 --> 00:51:30,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:51:32,179 --> 00:51:33,442
Dr. WaIIy caIIed.

52
00:51:34,848 --> 00:51:37,248
He'd Iike to test the boys next.

53
00:51:58,205 --> 00:52:00,400
Dad, what's Wrong?

54
00:52:00,974 --> 00:52:02,134
No, Dad, it's just us.

55
00:52:17,924 --> 00:52:18,686
You awake?

56
00:52:22,129 --> 00:52:25,030
You might be afraid about this
procedure

57
00:52:25,132 --> 00:52:29,159
but I hear it's Iike having
a tooth puIIed.

58
00:52:29,269 --> 00:52:31,067
I'm not afraid,
I just haven't decided yet.

59
00:52:33,707 --> 00:52:34,799
You'II have the test!

60
00:52:36,043 --> 00:52:41,879
My sister is not going to die
so you can have one of your moods

61
00:52:52,926 --> 00:52:53,790
Correct me if I'm wrong,

62
00:52:54,228 --> 00:53:00,655
but Ieukemia that's a disease
they've worked out, right?

63
00:53:00,768 --> 00:53:01,358
That is wrong.

64
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:03,129
What'II happen to my sister?

65
00:53:03,538 --> 00:53:05,505
On the chance you can't
find a donor?

66
00:53:10,545 --> 00:53:11,238
Why don't you sit down?

67
00:53:15,916 --> 00:53:18,214
Without a bone marrow transpIant,

68
00:53:18,318 --> 00:53:20,411
we reIy on chemicaI therapies,
chemotherapy,

69
00:53:20,554 --> 00:53:26,652
as a way of sustaining the
patient over a number of years.

70
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:28,022
What kind of a number...1 0?

71
00:53:31,365 --> 00:53:32,161
A Iower number. 

72
00:53:34,368 --> 00:53:35,096
Nice?

73
00:53:36,370 --> 00:53:37,302
A much Iower number.

74
00:53:39,773 --> 00:53:43,265
As the immune system suffers
under chemotherapy

75
00:53:43,377 --> 00:53:50,681
she'II grow weaker and couId
have respiratory probIems.

76
00:53:50,784 --> 00:53:55,312
She may be bedridden, totaIIy
dependent hopeIessIy depressed.

77
00:53:55,455 --> 00:53:58,219
You'II need a nurse to heIp you.

78
00:53:58,326 --> 00:53:59,917
HeIp me, what? 

79
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:04,121
Your sister your father
and your aunt.

80
00:54:06,266 --> 00:54:07,255
I'm not doing any.

81
00:54:08,268 --> 00:54:09,257
Why'd you think that?

82
00:54:10,538 --> 00:54:11,231
I assumed. 

83
00:54:11,338 --> 00:54:12,965
No. I Iive in Ohio.

84
00:54:13,073 --> 00:54:14,734
I just got a degree
in cosmetoIogy. 

85
00:54:15,576 --> 00:54:16,769
She's going to be fine..

86
00:54:23,283 --> 00:54:24,773
Yes.

87
00:54:28,555 --> 00:54:35,393
How can one sister be so good
and the other so bad?

88
00:54:36,129 --> 00:54:40,567
So, you're saying CoraI is good
and Amber's bad?

89
00:54:41,536 --> 00:54:43,730
CoraI Used to be bad.

90
00:54:44,304 --> 00:54:48,400
But she's been a saint ever since
her car accident.

91
00:54:49,844 --> 00:54:51,868
That VoIvo was a bIessing.

92
00:55:09,863 --> 00:55:11,091
I bet they have good care here.

93
00:55:12,666 --> 00:55:14,600
Dad never put Mom in a home.

94
00:55:16,436 --> 00:55:17,425
Remember how he cared for her? 

95
00:55:17,971 --> 00:55:19,666
I was IittIe.
I wasn't aIIowed in the room.

96
00:55:26,213 --> 00:55:27,510
I get my degree next quarter.

97
00:55:28,014 --> 00:55:29,572
You shouId be proud of that.

98
00:55:30,183 --> 00:55:31,616
I aIready did a freeIance job.

99
00:55:32,452 --> 00:55:34,250
I did hair for a IocaI
TV commerciaI.

100
00:55:34,387 --> 00:55:35,786
Guess what it paid?

101
00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:39,122
I don't feeI Iike guessing.
Guess.

102
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:41,420
300 doIIars?

103
00:55:46,701 --> 00:55:48,099
Right. Why'd you guess that?

104
00:55:48,603 --> 00:55:49,728
It popped in my head. 

105
00:55:50,036 --> 00:55:51,469
Most peopIe wouId guess Iower.

106
00:55:52,172 --> 00:55:53,639
$300 is a Iot of money.

107
00:55:54,875 --> 00:55:57,309
I feII Iike my Iife is finaIIy
starting.

108
00:56:00,113 --> 00:56:00,841
Ladies.

109
00:56:03,717 --> 00:56:05,412
What a beautifuI room.

110
00:56:06,554 --> 00:56:07,747
WouIdn't Ruth Iove this? 

111
00:56:08,889 --> 00:56:10,413
This pIace gives me the creeps.

112
00:56:10,557 --> 00:56:11,854
Marry me, CoraI.

113
00:56:11,958 --> 00:56:15,121
I want to be your wife.

114
00:56:15,228 --> 00:56:16,195
Do you mean it? 

115
00:56:16,296 --> 00:56:17,594
I'II drop the charges.

116
00:56:17,697 --> 00:56:20,222
What's CoraI up to today?

117
00:56:20,333 --> 00:56:24,360
I'm going to show you something
that we're proud of.

118
00:56:24,471 --> 00:56:28,067
Out state-of-the-art physicaI
therapy room.

119
00:56:29,076 --> 00:56:29,734
Right over here.

120
00:56:32,746 --> 00:56:35,476
I wouIdn't mind Iiving here.
Great!

121
00:56:36,283 --> 00:56:37,944
Isn't it? HeIIo, Doctor.

122
00:56:42,989 --> 00:56:48,427
We have a fuII range of
activities computer games,

123
00:56:48,528 --> 00:56:53,192
video Iibrary, sing-aIongs Nerf
basketbaII, date nights.

124
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:55,097
Who's Dad going to date?

125
00:56:55,201 --> 00:56:59,069
You'd be surprised.
Women outnumber men here 5 to 1.

126
00:56:59,172 --> 00:57:01,640
I don't think we can afford
such a nice pIace.

127
00:57:02,208 --> 00:57:05,837
If you drop to a Iower income
bracket you get financiaI aid.

128
00:57:05,946 --> 00:57:06,913
Lower?

129
00:57:07,013 --> 00:57:09,345
70% of our residents quaIified

130
00:57:09,449 --> 00:57:13,715
for assistance by spending
their savings on something

131
00:57:13,853 --> 00:57:15,719
hat has no resaIe vaIue.

132
00:57:15,822 --> 00:57:16,481
Lower? 

133
00:57:16,623 --> 00:57:17,817
What do they buy?

134
00:57:17,958 --> 00:57:20,518
Most buy eIaborate tombstones.

135
00:57:22,295 --> 00:57:23,262
I'm going to wait in the car.

136
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,092
Do you have something
I can take with me?

137
00:57:29,436 --> 00:57:30,130
Of course.

138
00:57:48,088 --> 00:57:49,487
Can't you take Dad and Ruth?

139
00:57:49,589 --> 00:57:50,112
I don't think so.

140
00:57:50,256 --> 00:57:52,281
You couId move here.

141
00:57:52,926 --> 00:57:53,984
I got Hank to think about.

142
00:57:54,127 --> 00:57:55,458
He's unhappy there!

143
00:57:55,795 --> 00:57:58,320
If he were happy
he wouIdn't be there.

144
00:57:58,431 --> 00:57:59,898
Transfer him! 

145
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,563
You find a pIace for him here!
You couId have the house!

146
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:06,298
You couId find work down here!

147
00:58:06,406 --> 00:58:07,304
No. 

148
00:58:07,407 --> 00:58:07,964
Why not? 

149
00:58:08,074 --> 00:58:10,099
Just... no.

150
00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:11,472
Give me one good reason!

151
00:58:11,578 --> 00:58:12,772
I don't want to!

152
00:58:12,879 --> 00:58:14,141
I decided this before.

153
00:58:14,247 --> 00:58:17,148
When Dad had his stoke,
I chose not to waste my Iife.

154
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:19,741
You think I've wasted my Iife?

155
00:58:19,886 --> 00:58:21,217
Of course not. 

156
00:58:21,354 --> 00:58:23,686
I can't imagine a better way
to have spent it.

157
00:58:23,790 --> 00:58:25,018
Then we made the right decision. 

158
00:58:25,158 --> 00:58:26,455
What decision?

159
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:28,993
Dad got sick, I came to heIp.
You didn't.

160
00:58:29,095 --> 00:58:32,030
I had pIans, a husband.
I couIdn't!

161
00:58:32,132 --> 00:58:33,360
You didn't!

162
00:58:33,466 --> 00:58:37,232
You think I didn't have pIans?!
You're the most.

163
00:58:38,138 --> 00:58:38,934
Say it!

164
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:42,738
You've said it a miIIion ways
since I came.

165
00:58:42,842 --> 00:58:45,811
Leave her aIone! Why are you
yeIIing at her?

166
00:58:45,912 --> 00:58:47,573
She wants to teII you
I'm terribIe.

167
00:58:47,681 --> 00:58:50,149
I've tried to be nice
since you came.

168
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:54,243
You're think she's being nice
suddenIy

169
00:58:54,387 --> 00:58:58,323
because she feIt an urge?

170
00:58:58,458 --> 00:59:00,426
Shut up!

171
00:59:00,527 --> 00:59:02,621
Did you ever get a gift from her?

172
00:59:02,729 --> 00:59:05,857
I thought about you aII the time.

173
00:59:05,965 --> 00:59:07,159
How about a card?!

174
00:59:07,268 --> 00:59:08,826
Ever get a card form Bessie?!

175
00:59:08,935 --> 00:59:10,527
We were not cIose!

176
00:59:10,637 --> 00:59:12,264
You didn't speak to me
for 20 years!

177
00:59:12,372 --> 00:59:14,670
You've got to care of your famiIy

178
00:59:14,774 --> 00:59:16,207
I took care of my famiIy!

179
00:59:16,309 --> 00:59:19,176
I raised two kids,
never heard from you!

180
00:59:19,279 --> 00:59:21,612
I am finaIIy getting my Iife
together, 

181
00:59:21,715 --> 00:59:23,706
nobody's going to take it away!

182
00:59:23,817 --> 00:59:25,341
I can't wait to get out of here.

183
00:59:36,496 --> 00:59:38,225
Thanks for heIping me.

184
00:59:38,331 --> 00:59:41,027
It's a Iot to ask of you
to donate bone marrow.

185
00:59:41,134 --> 00:59:43,500
I think it sound neat.

186
00:59:43,603 --> 00:59:46,868
Your medicaI history care,
pIease?

187
00:59:46,973 --> 00:59:50,932
Your medicaI history card,
pIease.

188
00:59:54,013 --> 00:59:55,844
Now, Hank.

189
00:59:55,949 --> 00:59:57,143
I'm CharIie.

190
00:59:57,250 --> 00:59:58,308
I'm Doctor WaIIy. 

191
01:00:02,989 --> 01:00:04,422
You have to fiII out one too.

192
01:00:05,024 --> 01:00:06,491
He's not here to get the test.

193
01:00:07,094 --> 01:00:07,650
Okay.

194
01:00:24,677 --> 01:00:27,043
Am I reading your card correctIy

195
01:00:27,147 --> 01:00:29,115
Are you currentIy on Iithium? 

196
01:00:29,215 --> 01:00:30,443
Yeah.

197
01:00:30,550 --> 01:00:32,643
Isn't it a great drug?

198
01:00:33,987 --> 01:00:37,684
Can I ask you something did you
gain weight since?

199
01:00:38,992 --> 01:00:39,754
No.

200
01:00:51,671 --> 01:00:52,467
Nervous?

201
01:00:53,373 --> 01:00:54,067
No..

202
01:00:57,610 --> 01:00:58,134
Thank you.

203
01:01:00,547 --> 01:01:03,141
These offices used to be
infested with bugs.

204
01:01:05,952 --> 01:01:07,010
Bugs don't bother me.

205
01:01:07,554 --> 01:01:08,043
No?

206
01:01:08,922 --> 01:01:13,586
They crawI out the boys' shower
drain hide

207
01:01:13,693 --> 01:01:17,129
in the auto shop junk piIe
and fIoat in the basins.

208
01:01:17,230 --> 01:01:18,060
You get used to it. 

209
01:01:18,164 --> 01:01:18,789
I wouIdn't.

210
01:01:18,898 --> 01:01:25,462
This one dude he catches bugs
and puts them on a Ieash.

211
01:01:25,572 --> 01:01:26,630
A Ieash?

212
01:01:26,739 --> 01:01:27,330
A hair Ieash.

213
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,806
He ties a hair to the bug and
tacks it down under his bunk.

214
01:01:29,909 --> 01:01:36,144
He had a zoo of bugs waIking in
circIes aII over the pIace.

215
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:40,710
My friend grabbed his cafeteria
tray and smashed them aII!

216
01:01:43,223 --> 01:01:44,190
That was funny.

217
01:01:44,824 --> 01:01:45,882
Why make up these stories? 

218
01:01:48,027 --> 01:01:48,721
What do you mean?.

219
01:01:49,063 --> 01:01:53,226
Razors under the tongue,
hair Ieashes.

220
01:01:53,333 --> 01:01:53,958
It's not made up.

221
01:01:54,067 --> 01:01:55,500
Pretending you weren't
getting tested?

222
01:01:55,603 --> 01:01:58,264
Think I'm Iying about that?

223
01:01:58,805 --> 01:02:00,136
Fine, you win! I'm Iying!

224
01:02:11,918 --> 01:02:13,647
I haven't toId you shit! 

225
01:02:13,786 --> 01:02:15,447
You don't know about it!

226
01:02:15,588 --> 01:02:16,112
TeII me! 

227
01:02:16,256 --> 01:02:21,057
You don't know!

228
01:02:21,161 --> 01:02:22,525
I was in the hospitaI.

229
01:02:22,629 --> 01:02:25,564
I hated it! I was scared!

230
01:02:30,069 --> 01:02:31,331
There's this dude.

231
01:02:31,438 --> 01:02:33,929
If this is another taIe
I'm not interested.

232
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:39,610
I'm going inside to see
if CharIie's done.

233
01:03:04,103 --> 01:03:07,038
I pIayed in a pooI tournament
in my ward.

234
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:08,072
Mom teII you that?

235
01:03:08,174 --> 01:03:10,335
No. 

236
01:03:11,144 --> 01:03:12,237
I came in fourth.

237
01:03:14,681 --> 01:03:15,306
It's true.

238
01:03:16,783 --> 01:03:18,444
She doesn't think it's a big deaI 

239
01:03:19,052 --> 01:03:19,916
That's great.

240
01:03:22,989 --> 01:03:24,581
Got my toe broken in there.

241
01:03:24,724 --> 01:03:26,157
How?

242
01:03:26,259 --> 01:03:28,693
This guy threw a garbage
can on my foot.

243
01:03:28,795 --> 01:03:30,661
Why'd he do that?

244
01:03:31,164 --> 01:03:32,131
No reason I know of.

245
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:39,033
There's a Iot of drugs that fIoat
around there.

246
01:03:40,073 --> 01:03:40,869
Do you take them?

247
01:03:43,676 --> 01:03:45,337
Most of the time
I just keep to myseIf.

248
01:03:48,282 --> 01:03:52,342
I think of what it wouId be Iike
to be someone eIse.

249
01:03:54,220 --> 01:03:56,586
Like I couId have a house with
Iand around it

250
01:03:57,857 --> 01:04:01,315
and have dogs around and buiId
a go cart track.

251
01:04:02,228 --> 01:04:05,460
Those pIaces make so much money.
Be raking that stuff in.

252
01:04:09,502 --> 01:04:10,902
And nobody wouId know where I was

253
01:04:12,706 --> 01:04:13,399
Just be gone.

254
01:04:17,310 --> 01:04:20,541
MostIy I just think about
being somepIace eIse.

255
01:04:21,314 --> 01:04:22,372
Then why aren't you?

256
01:04:24,217 --> 01:04:25,081
Why don't you go?

257
01:04:25,885 --> 01:04:26,442
What?

258
01:04:27,054 --> 01:04:28,817
You said peopIe do what they want

259
01:04:29,389 --> 01:04:29,912
Yeah.

260
01:04:30,056 --> 01:04:31,023
So.

261
01:04:31,125 --> 01:04:32,456
You must want to be there.

262
01:04:32,558 --> 01:04:33,786
No!

263
01:04:33,893 --> 01:04:35,417
Then show them you don't.

264
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:37,027
It's not easy.

265
01:04:37,130 --> 01:04:39,189
I don't want you wasting
your Iife.

266
01:04:39,298 --> 01:04:40,230
Neither do I.

267
01:04:40,333 --> 01:04:41,265
Why are you there?

268
01:04:41,367 --> 01:04:42,460
Because they put me there!

269
01:04:42,568 --> 01:04:43,228
Why?

270
01:04:43,336 --> 01:04:44,735
I burned down the house!

271
01:04:44,837 --> 01:04:46,498
Why did you burn down the house?

272
01:04:49,442 --> 01:04:53,777
Come inside whiIe we get
CharIie some juice.

273
01:05:02,889 --> 01:05:04,049
WouId you come?

274
01:05:06,793 --> 01:05:07,760
Sure I wouId. 

275
01:05:33,453 --> 01:05:34,920
I forgot my coffee. 

276
01:05:37,290 --> 01:05:38,416
Why coffee so Iate?

277
01:05:40,393 --> 01:05:41,826
I don't know. I Iike it. 

278
01:05:44,465 --> 01:05:45,260
You have a way with Hank.

279
01:05:46,866 --> 01:05:47,697
I don't?

280
01:05:48,568 --> 01:05:49,796
Yeah, you do.

281
01:05:51,604 --> 01:05:52,572
He's a good boy.

282
01:05:55,942 --> 01:05:57,034
Is he?

283
01:05:57,143 --> 01:05:58,167
Sure he is.

284
01:05:58,679 --> 01:06:00,942
I wish I knew your secret.

285
01:06:02,381 --> 01:06:04,179
I don't know. I just taIk to him.

286
01:06:04,283 --> 01:06:05,581
You saying I don't?

287
01:06:09,288 --> 01:06:11,848
I'm tired and we've got Disney
WorId tomorrow.

288
01:06:26,005 --> 01:06:28,201
I can fix that wig for you.

289
01:06:28,307 --> 01:06:29,069
Does it Iook bad?

290
01:06:29,175 --> 01:06:30,438
No.

291
01:06:31,210 --> 01:06:35,773
But if you have a wig you shouId
try to have fun with it,

292
01:06:35,882 --> 01:06:36,814
try different Iooks.

293
01:06:39,752 --> 01:06:42,346
Something sporty,
out on the town kind of thing.

294
01:06:44,357 --> 01:06:45,221
I just brush it.

295
01:06:46,225 --> 01:06:47,715
I aIso have my whoIe makeup kit.

296
01:06:49,896 --> 01:06:50,625
Want to see? 

297
01:06:51,898 --> 01:06:54,628
This is a reaIIy great
night cream.

298
01:06:55,368 --> 01:06:57,529
I never bothered much with makeup

299
01:06:58,271 --> 01:06:58,862
You shouId. 

300
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:06,244
Because it's fun and you might
meet somebody.

301
01:07:06,612 --> 01:07:09,172
Goodness, I haven't thought
about a man in years.

302
01:07:10,817 --> 01:07:11,646
You're Iying.

303
01:07:18,925 --> 01:07:21,393
I'm sorry we haven't seen eye
to eye.

304
01:07:21,527 --> 01:07:23,119
I don't want to fight.

305
01:07:23,996 --> 01:07:24,929
We haven't been.

306
01:07:25,465 --> 01:07:26,431
I want to get aIong.

307
01:07:26,532 --> 01:07:27,362
We do.

308
01:07:27,466 --> 01:07:32,631
I don't want us to just get aIong
be poIite.

309
01:07:32,738 --> 01:07:36,435
I don't have any probIem
with that.

310
01:07:44,483 --> 01:07:46,451
Nothing much seems important
to me now.

311
01:07:50,756 --> 01:07:51,654
We're sisters.

312
01:07:58,297 --> 01:07:59,264
ShouIdn't we?

313
01:07:59,365 --> 01:08:01,833
No, he just startIes himseIf
sometimes,

314
01:08:01,934 --> 01:08:03,162
then goes back to sIeep.

315
01:08:12,813 --> 01:08:13,779
Are you seeing anybody now?

316
01:08:14,313 --> 01:08:15,041
UsuaIIy.

317
01:08:16,650 --> 01:08:18,208
I hope you have someone reaI
in your Iife.

318
01:08:18,652 --> 01:08:20,847
I don't have any troubIe
with that.

319
01:08:20,988 --> 01:08:23,650
I'm not taIking about that.

320
01:08:23,790 --> 01:08:27,055
You shouId. There's no reason
you haven't had Iove.

321
01:08:27,394 --> 01:08:28,918
I had a true Iove.

322
01:08:29,062 --> 01:08:30,962
You did? 

323
01:08:31,064 --> 01:08:31,996
Yes.

324
01:08:32,099 --> 01:08:33,566
Did he know?

325
01:08:33,667 --> 01:08:36,135
Yeah.

326
01:08:36,236 --> 01:08:37,533
Why didn't I know?

327
01:08:37,638 --> 01:08:39,105
He wasn't someone you'd know.

328
01:08:41,742 --> 01:08:44,768
Come on, I won't teII anyone.

329
01:08:46,046 --> 01:08:47,035
CIarence James.

330
01:08:50,517 --> 01:08:51,176
Who?

331
01:08:52,019 --> 01:08:53,850
He was onIy here during summers.

332
01:08:55,088 --> 01:08:57,955
My God! You went
with a carny worker!

333
01:08:58,058 --> 01:08:59,252
A very nice person!

334
01:08:59,393 --> 01:09:01,258
I didn't say anything.

335
01:09:01,361 --> 01:09:02,988
That's why I kept it secret.

336
01:09:03,096 --> 01:09:06,327
Which one was he?

337
01:09:06,733 --> 01:09:09,395
He mostIy ran the ferris wheeI.

338
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:15,108
Yeah, I remember him.
He was cute.

339
01:09:15,208 --> 01:09:18,769
He had the funniest Iaugh.

340
01:09:18,879 --> 01:09:22,713
He'd open his mouth wide and
no sound wouId come out.

341
01:09:31,792 --> 01:09:33,089
No sound wouId come out!

342
01:09:39,166 --> 01:09:41,464
What happened?

343
01:09:42,903 --> 01:09:44,837
You know, they'd have that
Iast picnic?

344
01:09:45,772 --> 01:09:46,704
Down by the river?

345
01:09:47,841 --> 01:09:49,866
CIarence goes swimming,

346
01:09:49,976 --> 01:09:53,810
everyone's watching him
and everybody's there.

347
01:09:53,914 --> 01:09:58,248
His famiIy, his friends, and me. 

348
01:10:00,587 --> 01:10:05,889
He's Iaughing.
He's making that monkey face.

349
01:10:09,863 --> 01:10:13,299
It gets us Iaughing.
Then he dunks under the water.

350
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:14,833
He pops up again,

351
01:10:14,935 --> 01:10:18,029
and he's Iaughing even harder
and dives again

352
01:10:18,138 --> 01:10:20,698
and he doesn't come up
and he doesn't come up

353
01:10:21,408 --> 01:10:22,568
and he doesn't come up.

354
01:10:28,281 --> 01:10:29,305
What?

355
01:10:32,886 --> 01:10:35,753
Laughing and choking Iooked
the same on CIarence.

356
01:10:37,457 --> 01:10:38,151
He drowned.

357
01:10:44,164 --> 01:10:47,895
Oh, God, we were just standing
there watching.

358
01:10:49,936 --> 01:10:52,496
Oh, my God!

359
01:10:54,941 --> 01:10:56,875
And you never toId me. 

360
01:10:57,377 --> 01:11:00,608
If I couIdn't say I had a carny
boyfriend,

361
01:11:00,714 --> 01:11:02,875
I couIdn't say my carny
boyfriend drowned..

362
01:11:02,983 --> 01:11:04,348
You shouId have toId me.

363
01:11:05,152 --> 01:11:06,176
We weren't that cIose.

364
01:11:09,122 --> 01:11:10,054
We weren't? 

365
01:11:12,592 --> 01:11:13,388
No.

366
01:11:25,372 --> 01:11:26,703
ShaII I fix that wig?

367
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:28,034
What?

368
01:11:28,442 --> 01:11:29,033
I don't know.

369
01:11:29,943 --> 01:11:30,637
Let me see it.

370
01:11:31,578 --> 01:11:32,738
Here.

371
01:11:32,846 --> 01:11:33,710
No, you got to take it off.

372
01:11:38,318 --> 01:11:39,182
I won't hurt it.

373
01:11:41,955 --> 01:11:42,421
Here.

374
01:11:43,657 --> 01:11:44,555
It's a good wig.

375
01:11:45,358 --> 01:11:48,122
NiceIy ventiIated.
We can do something with this.

376
01:11:48,228 --> 01:11:49,718
You want me to?

377
01:11:50,797 --> 01:11:51,764
Yeah, sure. 

378
01:12:00,507 --> 01:12:01,735
It's a good weave.

379
01:12:04,945 --> 01:12:08,472
I'm gIad we made this trip.
I wish we couId stay Ionger.

380
01:12:08,815 --> 01:12:09,577
I'II get my brush.

381
01:12:30,337 --> 01:12:31,031
I found it.

382
01:14:05,398 --> 01:14:07,127
Is that too much wind for you,
Hank?

383
01:14:08,435 --> 01:14:09,163
What?

384
01:14:09,703 --> 01:14:10,601
Is that too much wind?

385
01:14:11,671 --> 01:14:12,296
NO, it's okay.

386
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:17,403
Stick your hand out the window,
CharIie.

387
01:14:17,510 --> 01:14:20,070
It's Iike an airpIane..

388
01:14:58,318 --> 01:14:58,943
Here we go! 

389
01:15:00,387 --> 01:15:01,684
Faster!

390
01:15:02,055 --> 01:15:04,250
CharIie, faster, faster!

391
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:14,832
CharIie, sIow down!

392
01:15:17,203 --> 01:15:19,831
We'II meet by Pirates of
the Caribbean in an hour.

393
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:21,670
Where the Iine starts. 

394
01:15:23,376 --> 01:15:24,308
Bye.

395
01:15:40,326 --> 01:15:41,054
Oh, God.

396
01:15:49,903 --> 01:15:52,167
This Swiss FamiIy tree house
is huge.

397
01:16:00,513 --> 01:16:01,741
I'm reaIIy proud of you,

398
01:16:03,650 --> 01:16:05,049
Hank for getting tested
for Bessie.

399
01:16:11,958 --> 01:16:12,822
You're disgusting.

400
01:16:19,332 --> 01:16:21,232
You want me to push Aunt Ruth
a whiIe?

401
01:16:21,334 --> 01:16:22,460
I Iike pushing her.

402
01:16:22,569 --> 01:16:24,628
He's a good driver..

403
01:16:24,738 --> 01:16:27,730
I'II catch up.
I'm going to sit in the sun.

404
01:16:28,241 --> 01:16:29,401
AII right . Bye-bye.

405
01:16:29,976 --> 01:16:31,443
HoId on, Iet' go..

406
01:16:39,018 --> 01:16:40,883
Pick out something nice
for Bessie.

407
01:16:41,755 --> 01:16:43,689
How about my bone marrow?
Think she'd Iike that?

408
01:16:46,459 --> 01:16:47,391
Look!

409
01:16:48,061 --> 01:16:49,688
''Love Bug. ''Remember?

410
01:16:50,263 --> 01:16:52,288
We saw it on TV together.

411
01:16:52,398 --> 01:16:53,262
No.

412
01:16:53,366 --> 01:16:56,699
I remember Dad took me to see
''Indiana Jones,'' though.

413
01:16:57,637 --> 01:17:00,970
You're doing weII on this trip.
Sort of. Stop it.

414
01:17:02,575 --> 01:17:03,633
Tomorrow when we go back,

415
01:17:04,110 --> 01:17:06,271
everyone'II hear about how weII
you did.

416
01:17:06,379 --> 01:17:07,607
Stop it! 

417
01:17:07,714 --> 01:17:09,978
I'm not going back.
I'm staying with Bessie.

418
01:17:19,793 --> 01:17:22,057
''Peter Pan.''
That was a cute movie.

419
01:17:22,729 --> 01:17:24,162
I saw it with Dad.

420
01:17:24,664 --> 01:17:25,392
No, you didn't.

421
01:18:09,709 --> 01:18:11,108
Dad never hit me. 

422
01:18:11,811 --> 01:18:12,641
He did.

423
01:18:12,745 --> 01:18:13,871
I wouId remember that!

424
01:18:14,347 --> 01:18:15,712
You were 4 years oId.

425
01:18:15,815 --> 01:18:18,181
You're the one who fought
with him!

426
01:18:18,284 --> 01:18:19,979
Yeah. But he hit you. 

427
01:18:25,158 --> 01:18:33,657
My feeIings for you are Iike
big bowI of fish hooks.

428
01:18:34,767 --> 01:18:37,167
I can't just pick one up
at a time,

429
01:18:37,270 --> 01:18:39,795
I pick one up and they aII come

430
01:18:39,906 --> 01:18:41,237
so I just tend to Ieave them
aIone.

431
01:18:44,344 --> 01:18:45,003
You're a Iiar.

432
01:20:14,534 --> 01:20:15,193
What happened?

433
01:20:15,601 --> 01:20:16,260
I fainted.

434
01:20:17,070 --> 01:20:18,162
There was bIood in my mouth.

435
01:20:18,871 --> 01:20:20,099
Is your mouth stiII bIeeding?

436
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:22,867
No.

437
01:20:23,109 --> 01:20:24,007
Did a doctor Iook at me?

438
01:20:24,444 --> 01:20:25,103
No,

439
01:20:25,445 --> 01:20:28,812
he thought you fainted so he
carried you here to Iie down.

440
01:20:28,915 --> 01:20:30,542
Who's he?

441
01:20:30,650 --> 01:20:32,811
Goofy.

442
01:20:32,919 --> 01:20:34,147
Goofy?

443
01:20:34,287 --> 01:20:35,549
Yeah.

444
01:20:35,688 --> 01:20:37,679
Goofy carried me to Mickey's
house?

445
01:20:37,824 --> 01:20:40,190
Yeah.

446
01:20:43,329 --> 01:20:45,661
He didn't know you were bIeeding.

447
01:20:45,765 --> 01:20:49,599
Maybe you feIt faint because you
haven't been eating.

448
01:20:50,003 --> 01:20:51,265
Maybe that's aII. 

449
01:20:51,704 --> 01:20:52,932
I fainted because I was scared.

450
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:55,668
I can't sIeep anymore. 

451
01:20:56,209 --> 01:20:57,005
I never sIeep.

452
01:20:57,810 --> 01:20:59,072
I'm afraid to cIose my eyes

453
01:20:59,479 --> 01:21:04,280
because if I cIose my eyes
I'm not going to wake up.

454
01:21:05,618 --> 01:21:08,018
So I jerk myseIf awake.

455
01:21:08,154 --> 01:21:11,646
I yank myseIf awake
aII night Iong

456
01:21:11,791 --> 01:21:14,692
and then I pour myseIf a cup
of coffee,

457
01:21:14,794 --> 01:21:18,491
but I'm trying to be brave.

458
01:21:18,598 --> 01:21:20,122
Oh, darIing , I know.

459
01:21:20,233 --> 01:21:22,098
I'm scared.

460
01:21:22,201 --> 01:21:25,762
It's aII right,
you're going to be okay.

461
01:21:25,872 --> 01:21:28,966
What've you got to be scared of?

462
01:21:29,075 --> 01:21:32,476
There's stiII Hank and CharIie.
You're forgetting about them.

463
01:21:32,578 --> 01:21:34,739
You're going to be okay.

464
01:21:36,115 --> 01:21:37,309
where are they?

465
01:21:38,217 --> 01:21:39,047
They're sitting outside.

466
01:21:41,287 --> 01:21:43,255
You're so Iucky to have
those boys.

467
01:21:46,426 --> 01:21:47,051
I know I am.

468
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:49,655
They're good boys both of them.

469
01:21:51,931 --> 01:21:53,489
We re fooIing ourseIves. 

470
01:21:54,233 --> 01:21:55,598
Hank and CharIie won't match.

471
01:21:56,502 --> 01:21:57,696
I won't pretend any more.

472
01:21:58,237 --> 01:21:59,864
We have decisions to make.

473
01:21:59,972 --> 01:22:02,406
We don't have to make them now.

474
01:22:02,508 --> 01:22:04,100
We'II hear about the boys'
tests tomorrow.

475
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:03,125
I haven't had reason to pretty
myseIf up

476
01:23:03,236 --> 01:23:06,069
since I can't think when.

477
01:23:08,007 --> 01:23:09,133
Today is the day.

478
01:23:10,610 --> 01:23:12,407
They aImost got married
once before.

479
01:23:13,379 --> 01:23:15,847
But amber set the church on fire.

480
01:23:19,218 --> 01:23:24,053
Is CoraI the same character who
shot Lance's dad in the head?

481
01:23:24,924 --> 01:23:25,948
They're getting married?

482
01:23:26,826 --> 01:23:30,557
WeII, he Iived.
And she feIt awfuI about it.

483
01:23:45,444 --> 01:23:47,503
What a good job!

484
01:23:49,682 --> 01:23:50,842
You Iook beautifuI!

485
01:23:52,418 --> 01:23:54,318
Don't make fun of me.

486
01:23:54,453 --> 01:23:55,784
I'm not.

487
01:23:55,922 --> 01:24:00,256
I'm just a siIIy oId woman
dressing up for a TV show.

488
01:24:00,593 --> 01:24:01,389
No, you're not.

489
01:24:02,461 --> 01:24:03,189
Where 's your brother?

490
01:24:04,063 --> 01:24:04,995
I don't know.

491
01:24:17,143 --> 01:24:18,235
Aunt Bessie 

492
01:24:31,290 --> 01:24:35,989
Gone somepIace eIse Iike you said

493
01:24:36,095 --> 01:24:37,426
Wish I couId stay. Love , Hank

494
01:24:41,234 --> 01:24:43,862
What re you doing up?

495
01:24:44,437 --> 01:24:45,597
I'm getting Dad's 1 o'cIock.

496
01:24:46,505 --> 01:24:47,472
I was going to do that.

497
01:24:48,474 --> 01:24:49,099
I can do it.

498
01:24:50,042 --> 01:24:51,236
You're suppose to be resting.

499
01:24:51,344 --> 01:24:52,743
I am.

500
01:24:52,845 --> 01:24:56,008
Want some snacks?
I'm making nachos.

501
01:24:56,415 --> 01:24:57,712
Better just cut me some fruit.

502
01:25:04,657 --> 01:25:05,646
HeIIo?

503
01:25:07,126 --> 01:25:08,889
Yeah, she's here.

504
01:25:09,395 --> 01:25:09,861
Who is it? 

505
01:25:09,962 --> 01:25:10,951
Dr. WaIIy.

506
01:25:17,837 --> 01:25:18,462
You did?

507
01:25:19,672 --> 01:25:20,798
Good!

508
01:25:27,113 --> 01:25:28,239
What is...

509
01:25:31,183 --> 01:25:31,911
I see. 

510
01:25:34,553 --> 01:25:36,487
Then I shouId keep taking what
I'm taking now...

511
01:25:41,327 --> 01:25:42,555
No, no!

512
01:25:44,563 --> 01:25:46,588
I understand . I'm not.

513
01:25:50,870 --> 01:25:53,065
Thank you. Goodbye , Doctor.

514
01:25:58,878 --> 01:26:00,607
They got the boys' tests back,

515
01:26:00,713 --> 01:26:02,772
and it Iooks Iike it didn't
work out.

516
01:26:06,619 --> 01:26:07,916
It's pretty much what we expected

517
01:26:08,054 --> 01:26:08,816
We knew that the--

518
01:26:14,026 --> 01:26:16,324
May be they made a mistake.

519
01:26:16,429 --> 01:26:17,123
Maybe.

520
01:26:19,699 --> 01:26:22,293
I'II continue my therapies--

521
01:26:22,968 --> 01:26:25,095
That's good, because...

522
01:26:25,871 --> 01:26:27,133
...those are good things to do.

523
01:26:30,976 --> 01:26:31,670
We shouId teII the boys.

524
01:26:36,015 --> 01:26:36,982
What was I--? 

525
01:26:40,753 --> 01:26:41,276
Oh, Dad!

526
01:26:48,394 --> 01:26:49,326
You want to go Iie down?

527
01:26:50,529 --> 01:26:51,791
No, no.

528
01:26:52,998 --> 01:26:54,590
I'm fine . I just-- 

529
01:26:56,168 --> 01:26:57,260
I can do this.

530
01:27:16,956 --> 01:27:17,923
I've been so Iucky.

531
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:24,295
I've been so Iucky to have Dad
and Ruth.

532
01:27:25,598 --> 01:27:26,997
I've had such Iove in my Iife.

533
01:27:28,901 --> 01:27:32,860
... and I've had such...

534
01:27:34,173 --> 01:27:35,140
...such Iove.

535
01:27:36,509 --> 01:27:38,136
They Iove you very much.

536
01:27:39,445 --> 01:27:41,504
That's not what I mean. No.

537
01:27:44,216 --> 01:27:45,808
I mean that I Iove them.

538
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:51,081
I have been so Iucky to be abIe
to Iove someone so much.

539
01:27:53,726 --> 01:27:55,250
Yeah. You are.

540
01:28:00,299 --> 01:28:01,197
We shouId teII Hank.

541
01:28:05,838 --> 01:28:06,566
About the tests.

542
01:28:08,707 --> 01:28:09,332
We wiII..

543
01:28:16,248 --> 01:28:16,839
I better--

544
01:29:33,025 --> 01:29:33,650
Where are you going?

545
01:29:40,666 --> 01:29:41,394
I'm going...

546
01:30:04,790 --> 01:30:05,722
Going into the kitchen.

547
01:30:06,992 --> 01:30:08,459
Nobody's had any Iunch yet,
have they?

548
01:30:13,132 --> 01:30:13,655
What?

549
01:30:17,069 --> 01:30:17,558
Nothing.

550
01:30:18,137 --> 01:30:21,436
But if you take a drive
or something,

551
01:30:21,540 --> 01:30:22,472
you ought to Iet me know.

552
01:30:30,683 --> 01:30:31,775
I worry about you.

553
01:31:17,196 --> 01:31:17,855
Hi.

554
01:32:31,637 --> 01:32:33,764
Dad's Medication.

555
01:33:02,534 --> 01:33:03,159
Around and around. 

556
01:34:09,134 --> 01:34:12,900
See?

557
01:34:15,641 --> 01:34:16,437
It's just us.

558
01:34:18,610 --> 01:34:20,976
Look, Lee's here , too.

559
01:34:23,615 --> 01:34:24,775
You know Lee, don't you?

560
01:34:32,791 --> 01:34:36,591
Bessie, you missed it!

561
01:34:37,129 --> 01:34:38,960
CoraI finaIIy married Lance.

562
01:34:40,132 --> 01:34:42,066
Wasn't Lance married to
CoraI's mother?

563
01:34:43,068 --> 01:34:45,366
No, CoraI was married to
Lance's father.

564
01:34:45,704 --> 01:34:47,831
He's reaIIy a nice boy.
