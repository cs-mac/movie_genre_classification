1
00:00:32,945 --> 00:00:34,456
Hi, it's Marla.

2
00:00:34,749 --> 00:00:37,773
I changed my mind.
I can't do this right now.

3
00:00:38,933 --> 00:00:40,175
You're here?

4
00:00:40,995 --> 00:00:42,378
At the club?

5
00:00:45,741 --> 00:00:48,038
No. I can't meet you.

6
00:00:48,073 --> 00:00:50,441
I have to get back to my daughter.

7
00:00:53,827 --> 00:00:55,058
Mom?

8
00:00:58,645 --> 00:01:00,177
Mom.

9
00:01:06,101 --> 00:01:07,390
Mom.

10
00:01:10,027 --> 00:01:12,781
Mom! Where are you?

11
00:01:44,027 --> 00:01:47,881
Lie To Me 02x03 - Control Factor

12
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,257
You don't trust me.

13
00:01:49,292 --> 00:01:51,453
It's such a control thing.
Admit it. Admit it.

14
00:01:51,488 --> 00:01:53,598
You're reluctant to leave me in charge.

15
00:01:53,856 --> 00:01:56,209
Rubbish.
Then why haven't you gone yet?

16
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:59,069
What?
Why are you trying to get rid of me?

17
00:01:59,104 --> 00:02:01,260
You haven't had a vacation in 6 years, Cal.
Come on.

18
00:02:01,295 --> 00:02:03,592
You are trying to miss your flight.
I am not.

19
00:02:03,627 --> 00:02:06,218
I am not. I am trying to find

20
00:02:06,253 --> 00:02:07,554
The Anderson file.
The Anderson file.

21
00:02:07,589 --> 00:02:09,160
I've got it, all right?

22
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:10,988
I can take care of it. Come on.

23
00:02:11,023 --> 00:02:12,578
Stop stalling.

24
00:02:12,613 --> 00:02:14,515
Where are you going?
Honestly, Cal.

25
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,117
The cab is outside waiting for you.
Grab your jacket and let's go.

26
00:02:17,152 --> 00:02:18,546
You deserve this.

27
00:02:18,581 --> 00:02:20,597
- Emily's waiting for you. Come on.
- Don't push me. Don't push me.

28
00:02:20,632 --> 00:02:22,747
Come on, let's go. Here.

29
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:24,856
Here.
Oh, give me your cell phone.

30
00:02:24,891 --> 00:02:28,207
You don't need to check in while you're gone.
It's just gonna stress you out. Come on.

31
00:02:28,407 --> 00:02:30,141
No kicking and screaming?

32
00:02:30,762 --> 00:02:33,024
I have absolute faith in you.

33
00:02:33,293 --> 00:02:34,711
And my staff.

34
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:38,954
Here I go, then.

35
00:02:40,676 --> 00:02:42,153
Have a good time.

36
00:03:00,707 --> 00:03:02,664
Are you really working?

37
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:04,633
We've only been here 2 days.

38
00:03:05,113 --> 00:03:07,281
You really need to learn how to relax, dad.

39
00:03:07,316 --> 00:03:10,953
People who can't relax die younger.
I learned that in health class.

40
00:03:10,988 --> 00:03:12,781
Don't worry about me, love, will you?

41
00:03:12,816 --> 00:03:15,184
- What are you looking at, anyway?
- Nothing.

42
00:03:15,219 --> 00:03:17,117
You're spying on the Office?

43
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,973
Look, I'm my own Boss.
That's a 24/7 job.

44
00:03:21,008 --> 00:03:24,065
Someday, when I'm a stressed-out workaholic,
I'll have you to thank.

45
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,647
When did you become such a know-it-all?

46
00:03:25,682 --> 00:03:28,214
We had an agreement that
if I behave maturely,

47
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:31,682
You would treat me like an adult.
So, as an adult, I'm telling you to relax

48
00:03:31,717 --> 00:03:33,756
- And stop it with the creepy snooping.
- Hey.

49
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:36,990
If you don't,
I'll just go pick up boys by the pool.

50
00:03:37,025 --> 00:03:38,900
All right, deal.

51
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:41,560
Oh, I'll have one of those, too, thanks.

52
00:03:41,595 --> 00:03:43,478
Make it a virgin.

53
00:03:45,228 --> 00:03:46,951
Dr. Cal Lightman?

54
00:03:48,674 --> 00:03:51,130
My name's Lou Nemeroff.
I'm with the American Embassy.

55
00:03:51,165 --> 00:03:54,422
There's an urgent matter
that we need your help with.

56
00:03:59,977 --> 00:04:01,864
An American woman,
Marla Seeger,

57
00:04:01,899 --> 00:04:04,254
Disappeared 2 days ago
from the Oceano Hotel.

58
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:06,059
It's just down the beach.

59
00:04:06,094 --> 00:04:09,692
She was last seen at the Hotel bar.
This is local news footage.

60
00:04:09,727 --> 00:04:12,880
La mujer Americana...
Muy borracha.

61
00:04:13,548 --> 00:04:16,782
This is the bartender who last saw her.
He says that she was drunk,

62
00:04:16,817 --> 00:04:20,319
Coming on to several men, and that
she eventually left with one of them.

63
00:04:20,354 --> 00:04:23,061
Ahora, lo tenemos razon para creer que...

64
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,300
The Local Police,
they aren't doing anything.

65
00:04:25,335 --> 00:04:27,690
They believe that she left voluntarily.

66
00:04:28,053 --> 00:04:30,951
She's a really good mom.
I just want to find her.

67
00:04:31,677 --> 00:04:34,256
Mom, if you're watching this,

68
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,084
Please come back.

69
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,545
And that's her 12-year-old daughter.

70
00:04:40,162 --> 00:04:42,611
Oh, my God, that's so sad.

71
00:04:43,361 --> 00:04:44,990
What's the State Department
doing about this?

72
00:04:45,025 --> 00:04:48,154
Their official policy is to leave it
in the hands of local Authorities.

73
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:49,783
Oh, so nothing.

74
00:04:49,818 --> 00:04:51,545
They're doing nothing.

75
00:04:51,986 --> 00:04:54,278
Which makes me wonder why you're here.

76
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,775
Your Boss doesn't know about this
little field trip of yours, does he?

77
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,925
I can't ignore what's going on in Mexico.

78
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,127
Which is what?

79
00:05:01,161 --> 00:05:03,915
More than 200 Americans have gone
missing in the last few years,

80
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,276
Mostly collateral damage
from the drug Cartels,

81
00:05:06,311 --> 00:05:10,456
But unless it's some pretty blond teenager,
nobody even wants to talk about it.

82
00:05:11,007 --> 00:05:14,710
All I need to know is if somebody on
this video is trying to hide something.

83
00:05:14,745 --> 00:05:18,564
Yeah, the Detective in charge of
the case and, um, the bartender.

84
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,244
Dr. Lightman,
can you help us find Marla Seeger?

85
00:05:23,428 --> 00:05:24,887
- Dad.
- What?

86
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,410
Come on.

87
00:05:29,551 --> 00:05:32,878
Some people at the Hotel, they
said that they saw your mom crying.

88
00:05:32,913 --> 00:05:34,519
Why was she sad?

89
00:05:34,554 --> 00:05:36,007
I don't know.

90
00:05:36,611 --> 00:05:40,624
Everyone's saying she was a bad mother,
but she always took good care of me.

91
00:05:41,128 --> 00:05:42,978
Yeah, I'll bet she did.

92
00:05:43,013 --> 00:05:44,597
You think you can find her?

93
00:05:44,632 --> 00:05:47,945
Oh, absolutely.
He's definitely gonna find your mom.

94
00:05:51,265 --> 00:05:52,745
I don't know.

95
00:05:52,999 --> 00:05:54,645
I don't know, love.

96
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:59,304
You ever think that
grownups are full of crap?

97
00:06:00,358 --> 00:06:02,315
Yeah. Lots of times.

98
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,882
Usually it's 'cause we've made a mistake,

99
00:06:05,175 --> 00:06:07,706
Done something wrong,
but we don't want

100
00:06:07,741 --> 00:06:09,804
To talk about it,
we don't want to admit it.

101
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:12,159
Which makes us Hypocrites.

102
00:06:13,976 --> 00:06:16,483
I think you've got a secret.

103
00:06:17,058 --> 00:06:19,647
And you're too scared to talk about it.

104
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:38,590
Mom always picks awful boyfriends, so
I signed her up for an Online dating service.

105
00:06:41,789 --> 00:06:43,301
This is a guy you found for her?

106
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:45,844
He said he traveled a lot and
I told him we were coming here.

107
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:47,567
Well, what did he say?

108
00:06:48,364 --> 00:06:49,875
He said he'd meet me.

109
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,811
I wasn't aware of this.

110
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,796
J-Rod25.

111
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,843
My mom was supposed to have
dinner with him last night.

112
00:06:57,821 --> 00:07:00,036
What if he did something to my mom?

113
00:07:03,493 --> 00:07:05,439
We rushed over here right away.
Did we hear right?

114
00:07:05,474 --> 00:07:07,654
3 patients have been
infected by tainted blood?

115
00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:09,892
The first patient died this
morning at Cottage Hospital,

116
00:07:09,927 --> 00:07:12,552
And the second is in critical
condition at St. Mary's.

117
00:07:12,587 --> 00:07:16,860
This is Gary Spar, the third patient to
receive a blood transfusion during surgery.

118
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:19,626
It should have been a routine operation,
but he never woke up.

119
00:07:19,661 --> 00:07:22,849
I need you to seal off that O.R.
and gather and test everything.

120
00:07:22,884 --> 00:07:24,794
So 3 different patients
at 3 different Hospitals?

121
00:07:24,829 --> 00:07:28,929
It's no longer a coincidence.
We shut down the D.C. central blood bank.

122
00:07:28,964 --> 00:07:32,282
Go help pat rule out any
other possible contaminants.

123
00:07:32,317 --> 00:07:34,775
We're in a real quandary.
We need to protect people,

124
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:38,308
But if there's no blood available for
trauma cases and other emergencies,

125
00:07:38,343 --> 00:07:39,896
Patients may die anyway.

126
00:07:39,931 --> 00:07:41,408
Do you have any idea what's in the blood?

127
00:07:41,443 --> 00:07:45,322
Oh, worst case scenario, it's a
biological or a chemical agent.

128
00:07:45,357 --> 00:07:48,376
The FBI has been alerted in
case this is Bioterrorism.

129
00:07:48,411 --> 00:07:50,449
I know.
I'm on my way to the Hospital CEO,

130
00:07:50,483 --> 00:07:51,931
- Right now.
- What can we do to help?

131
00:07:51,966 --> 00:07:54,626
The people who have
access to those blood units

132
00:07:54,661 --> 00:07:57,749
All claim no involvement or knowledge.

133
00:07:57,784 --> 00:07:59,929
I need to know who we can trust.

134
00:08:00,374 --> 00:08:01,968
Should we get Lightman back here?

135
00:08:02,003 --> 00:08:03,855
I can take care of this.

136
00:08:04,278 --> 00:08:06,011
- Oh, hey.
- Hey. What have you got?

137
00:08:06,046 --> 00:08:09,164
Well, the tainted blood units all came
from the overnight shift at the blood Banks.

138
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,933
There were 2 Techs on duty.

139
00:08:10,968 --> 00:08:13,523
We're taking them down to the Lightman
group right now for questioning.

140
00:08:13,558 --> 00:08:15,410
Dr. Cho,
I haven't forgotten about you.

141
00:08:15,445 --> 00:08:17,847
As soon as I have a minute, we'll talk.

142
00:08:18,773 --> 00:08:20,683
That little boy has Sickle Cell Anemia.

143
00:08:20,718 --> 00:08:23,367
If he doesn't have a blood transfusion
in the next 24 hours,

144
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:24,738
He could have a stroke.

145
00:08:24,773 --> 00:08:26,261
What about getting the blood
from outside areas?

146
00:08:26,296 --> 00:08:27,843
There's a real shortage.
We're working on it,

147
00:08:27,878 --> 00:08:30,035
But it's gonna take time
that we don't have.

148
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:33,351
Oh, Jack, thank God you're here.
Do you know Dr. Foster?

149
00:08:33,386 --> 00:08:35,776
Gillian, this is a lovely surprise.

150
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:39,151
- What are you doing here?
- The CDC contacted the Rader firm

151
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,835
To help assist you since
Dr. Lightman isn't here.

152
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,300
Where is Cal?

153
00:08:43,335 --> 00:08:44,530
He's on vacation.

154
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,811
And hell didn't freeze over?

155
00:08:47,729 --> 00:08:49,811
Well, now it's a shame he's gone.

156
00:08:49,846 --> 00:08:51,491
I was hoping he and I
could bury the hatchet.

157
00:08:51,526 --> 00:08:54,004
- Is there a problem?
- Lightman and I are...

158
00:08:54,238 --> 00:08:55,984
Friendly rivals, so to speak.

159
00:08:56,019 --> 00:08:57,611
It won't be a problem.

160
00:08:57,646 --> 00:08:58,914
Will it?

161
00:08:59,359 --> 00:09:01,845
No. Not at all.

162
00:09:05,359 --> 00:09:06,478
Oh, hey, hey.

163
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:08,430
The 2 Techs from the blood Bank are here.

164
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,621
So tell me, what's the deal
with Lightman and Rader?

165
00:09:10,656 --> 00:09:12,766
What, they don't get along or something?

166
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:15,016
Cal despises him.

167
00:09:15,051 --> 00:09:17,344
He thinks all he cares about
is money and publicity.

168
00:09:17,379 --> 00:09:19,399
Well, for once I'm with Lightman on this.

169
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:21,912
Something tells me not to trust that guy.

170
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:27,590
Hey. Hi.

171
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,547
You're the Detective in charge
of the Seeger case, right?

172
00:09:29,582 --> 00:09:30,801
Yes.

173
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:33,836
Hey. I'm Emily Lightman.
This is Dr. Cal Lightman.

174
00:09:33,871 --> 00:09:35,418
He's a deception expert

175
00:09:35,453 --> 00:09:37,211
And he works along with the
Police in the United States.

176
00:09:37,246 --> 00:09:38,878
In the United States, yeah.

177
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:41,090
- This is Mexico.
- No, I knew that.

178
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,438
I knew it.

179
00:09:42,473 --> 00:09:45,660
Um, now,
I saw some news footage,

180
00:09:45,883 --> 00:09:50,243
And I think that the bartender at Marla
Seeger's Hotel is giving false information

181
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,751
About her disappearance.
Dr. Lightman,

182
00:09:52,786 --> 00:09:54,251
There is no case here.

183
00:09:54,286 --> 00:09:56,196
Ok?
We spoke to several Resort employees.

184
00:09:56,231 --> 00:09:59,278
They said she seemed unstable,
more than likely a drug user.

185
00:09:59,313 --> 00:10:00,461
Based on what?

186
00:10:00,496 --> 00:10:02,512
We found several used needles
in her Hotel room.

187
00:10:02,547 --> 00:10:04,669
She probably found a fellow drug user,
left with him.

188
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,906
She will be back when the drugs run out.

189
00:10:06,941 --> 00:10:10,703
Ok. I still think you should
have another go at the bartender.

190
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:14,910
And I think that you and your daughter
should have a very lovely time here. Ok?

191
00:10:14,945 --> 00:10:17,371
Por favor,
lleve a este gente afuera.

192
00:10:17,406 --> 00:10:21,822
No, what about the guy that Tyler
said her mom was gonna meet?

193
00:10:22,103 --> 00:10:24,553
- You spoke to Tyler?
- Yeah.

194
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,557
There are many people here
who would not like the fact

195
00:10:29,592 --> 00:10:31,604
That you have shown interest in this matter.
Do you understand me?

196
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:34,639
So I'm gonna give you one piece of advice.

197
00:10:34,979 --> 00:10:36,995
Stay out of this.

198
00:10:43,256 --> 00:10:44,639
Mojito, por favor.

199
00:10:44,674 --> 00:10:46,280
And a Margarita.

200
00:10:46,315 --> 00:10:47,909
A Coke.

201
00:10:47,944 --> 00:10:49,760
Coke for the Senorita.

202
00:10:49,936 --> 00:10:51,565
Enjoying your vacation, Senor?
Yeah.

203
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,548
Well, no, I was until that woman turned
up missing. What's her name again?

204
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,341
Ah... Marla Seeger.

205
00:10:56,376 --> 00:10:57,536
That's it, yeah.

206
00:10:57,571 --> 00:10:59,868
Hey, you're the guy on the TV, right?

207
00:10:59,903 --> 00:11:01,848
You saw her that night?

208
00:11:02,118 --> 00:11:03,735
What do you think happened to her?

209
00:11:04,005 --> 00:11:06,114
She was dancing with many different men.

210
00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:09,061
She was looking for a good time.
She left with one of them.

211
00:11:09,096 --> 00:11:11,076
They were sleeping on the beach
or getting high.

212
00:11:11,111 --> 00:11:13,572
What did he look like,
the guy she left with?

213
00:11:13,607 --> 00:11:17,111
Don't let this trouble get in your head, Senor.
Everything is fine.

214
00:11:24,096 --> 00:11:27,037
You're an awful liar, Miguel.

215
00:11:27,675 --> 00:11:30,549
Now you're terrified.
What is it?

216
00:11:32,644 --> 00:11:35,025
- You work for the Police?
- Miguel.

217
00:11:40,251 --> 00:11:42,970
Vete a la casa, ahora.

218
00:11:44,951 --> 00:11:48,784
I'm so sorry.
We are closing this bar while we restock.

219
00:11:50,718 --> 00:11:52,347
- Is there a problem?
- No.

220
00:11:52,382 --> 00:11:55,433
If you're here on vacation,
please tell us whatever we can do

221
00:11:55,468 --> 00:11:57,296
To make your stay more enjoyable.

222
00:11:57,331 --> 00:12:00,272
If, however, you're here
conducting an Investigation,

223
00:12:00,307 --> 00:12:02,042
You're not welcome here.

224
00:12:06,999 --> 00:12:09,437
Yeah, Torres, it's me.
I need you down here.

225
00:12:09,472 --> 00:12:10,820
Wait, for what?

226
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,870
Uh, a woman's gone missing.

227
00:12:12,905 --> 00:12:14,945
Yeah. I'll tell you all about it
when you get down here.

228
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,843
Just bring something pretty
to wear, all right?

229
00:12:16,878 --> 00:12:18,027
Yeah.

230
00:12:18,062 --> 00:12:19,585
Dude, you're gonna find her.

231
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,620
For you,
I will move heaven and earth.

232
00:12:23,851 --> 00:12:26,716
Hey. Lightman just called.
He needs me to fly down to Zulia right now.

233
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:29,031
He's on a case?
Yeah. A woman's missing.

234
00:12:29,066 --> 00:12:30,601
I gotta go.

235
00:12:30,636 --> 00:12:32,499
Uhh. He's on vacation.

236
00:12:34,316 --> 00:12:36,226
Ok. Just give me one sec.

237
00:12:36,788 --> 00:12:38,909
So, how is it working for Cal?

238
00:12:38,944 --> 00:12:40,398
Been so long, I can't remember.

239
00:12:40,433 --> 00:12:43,175
I work with Cal.
I'm an equity partner, you know.

240
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,917
Good for you. That means Cal's
been working on his control issues.

241
00:12:45,952 --> 00:12:47,745
Jack... I meant that as a compliment.

242
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:51,741
Seriously, he was my mentor. I have nothing
but respect and admiration for the man.

243
00:12:51,776 --> 00:12:54,260
Obviously, he doesn't feel the same about me.

244
00:12:54,295 --> 00:12:56,674
Cal says he taught you
just enough to be dangerous.

245
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,678
He's the better scientist,
no doubt.

246
00:12:58,713 --> 00:13:02,123
But I'm not going to apologize for having
ambition and a better Business sense.

247
00:13:02,158 --> 00:13:04,790
If we're gonna work together,
I have some ground rules.

248
00:13:04,824 --> 00:13:06,576
First, I'm the Boss around here.

249
00:13:06,611 --> 00:13:09,905
Second, don't try using me
to get back at Cal.

250
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,592
So long as you...

251
00:13:12,108 --> 00:13:15,635
Admit that there's just the tiniest
moment happening right now.

252
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,205
Will you admit that?

253
00:13:17,451 --> 00:13:20,662
Hey, Romeo and Juliet,
you want to get this show on the road?

254
00:13:20,697 --> 00:13:23,216
People could be dying right now.

255
00:13:26,604 --> 00:13:28,642
You can leave.
Thank you for coming.

256
00:13:28,677 --> 00:13:32,088
Agent Reynolds, could you escort him out
and bring Miss Bynes to a more private room?

257
00:13:32,123 --> 00:13:34,314
Sure.
Will you come with me, please?

258
00:13:34,525 --> 00:13:37,466
People hiding something never want
to draw attention to themselves.

259
00:13:37,619 --> 00:13:38,943
That was awesome.

260
00:13:38,978 --> 00:13:41,545
The old routine's a little rusty,
but she still works.

261
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:44,838
- I meant what I said about the ground rules.
- And I meant what I said.

262
00:13:45,611 --> 00:13:48,150
Shall we go find out what
Miss Vines is hiding?

263
00:13:48,646 --> 00:13:50,193
Nice work.

264
00:13:54,013 --> 00:13:57,224
It was a regular night at the
blood Bank... nothing unusual.

265
00:13:57,259 --> 00:14:00,916
Your Boss was about to fire
you for being late too often.

266
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,183
You knew.

267
00:14:04,571 --> 00:14:06,317
Was this retaliation?

268
00:14:06,352 --> 00:14:08,497
She's breathing faster.
Foster's getting somewhere.

269
00:14:08,532 --> 00:14:10,957
You have no idea how good she is.

270
00:14:10,992 --> 00:14:15,799
Lightman doesn't know. He has a hard time
seeing the true potential of his employees.

271
00:14:18,269 --> 00:14:19,851
What was that?

272
00:14:19,886 --> 00:14:23,417
Little flash of anger at
the infallible Cal Lightman?

273
00:14:24,046 --> 00:14:28,687
You run this entire Lab. But I'll bet Lightman's
never showed you an ounce of appreciation.

274
00:14:29,249 --> 00:14:31,897
So, you and Lightman...

275
00:14:32,319 --> 00:14:34,475
- We had a falling-out.
- What, over a case?

276
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,245
Water under the bridge now.

277
00:14:36,983 --> 00:14:40,804
You know, I never knew my own worth until
I got out from under Lightman's shadow.

278
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:43,018
Someday, you'll do that same.

279
00:14:43,053 --> 00:14:46,054
It's been hard for me. My husband
left us. I'm alone with the kids.

280
00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:47,736
Voice pitch is higher.

281
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:49,883
What's that look there?
Shame?

282
00:14:50,882 --> 00:14:53,507
I just went through a divorce myself.

283
00:14:53,858 --> 00:14:55,698
I can barely get out of bed.

284
00:14:55,733 --> 00:14:58,452
I can't think straight,
I can't do my job right...

285
00:14:59,893 --> 00:15:01,815
People are dying.

286
00:15:02,436 --> 00:15:08,118
You feel guilty, but you're gonna feel worse
if you keep secrets and another person dies.

287
00:15:12,598 --> 00:15:15,915
On my last shift, I didn't run the
full testing protocol on the blood.

288
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:19,083
So, you have to test on any
blood for different diseases.

289
00:15:19,383 --> 00:15:21,880
I left early.
My daughter needed me.

290
00:15:21,915 --> 00:15:24,633
There are so many other safeguards.
I didn't think.

291
00:15:24,668 --> 00:15:26,227
I just...

292
00:15:30,048 --> 00:15:32,520
I think we have our culprit.
No, we don't.

293
00:15:32,696 --> 00:15:36,165
Someone else just died after
a transfusion at Euclid Park.

294
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,145
And this patient Banked his own blood.

295
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,983
Central blood Bank isn't responsible.

296
00:15:43,454 --> 00:15:46,313
So, you're setting me up on a blind
date with a potential murderer?

297
00:15:46,348 --> 00:15:48,118
Yeah. Why?
He's not your type?

298
00:15:48,153 --> 00:15:50,110
I'll keep an eye on you.
You'll be fine.

299
00:15:50,743 --> 00:15:52,840
- What are the Police doing?
- Nothing.

300
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,396
So, we're doing this on our own.
Yeah.

301
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:58,506
You know, you pulled me off
a really big case back home.

302
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,252
The CDC brought in the
Rader firm to work with us...

303
00:16:00,287 --> 00:16:01,928
Jack Rader?
Yeah, he's at the Office

304
00:16:01,963 --> 00:16:03,932
Working with Foster.
Why? What's the problem?

305
00:16:04,155 --> 00:16:06,634
Not sure. Not sure. Get in.

306
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,755
Want to see the sights?

307
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,149
Yeah.

308
00:16:12,176 --> 00:16:15,071
Who you with?
You, uh, with the Hotel?

309
00:16:15,739 --> 00:16:17,074
Police?

310
00:16:18,973 --> 00:16:20,555
Drug Cartel?

311
00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:26,121
Who's that guy?

312
00:16:26,156 --> 00:16:28,981
He's with the Police or drug Cartel.

313
00:16:34,981 --> 00:16:36,375
Dont go anywhere.

314
00:16:46,698 --> 00:16:48,034
Miguel?

315
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:55,042
How did you find me here?

316
00:16:55,077 --> 00:16:56,776
I bribed a waitress at the Hotel.

317
00:16:58,241 --> 00:17:00,327
You picked the wrong part of Town to visit.

318
00:17:00,362 --> 00:17:02,472
So, you think I should call the Cops, then?

319
00:17:02,507 --> 00:17:03,819
Eh?

320
00:17:03,854 --> 00:17:06,948
Oh, are you scared of being seen
with me by the Police, are you?

321
00:17:07,616 --> 00:17:09,421
Turistas estupidos.

322
00:17:09,456 --> 00:17:10,956
Eso fue un "si"

323
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:14,753
Dinos la verdad sobre Marla Seeger,
y nos iremos.

324
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,198
The Police told us to say the American
lady was looking for a good time,

325
00:17:21,233 --> 00:17:23,167
That it was her own fault.
Why?

326
00:17:23,472 --> 00:17:25,441
Zulia depends on tourists.

327
00:17:25,476 --> 00:17:27,960
Something bad happens,
you all disappear, the Town dies.

328
00:17:27,995 --> 00:17:31,862
After the lady from Miami disappeared,
we were told not to talk to anyone about...

329
00:17:33,843 --> 00:17:35,648
What lady from Miami?

330
00:17:39,023 --> 00:17:41,484
Do you want me to call the Cops, or...

331
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,507
She came here 4 months ago.

332
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:46,382
She was found dead.

333
00:17:46,417 --> 00:17:48,808
The Police kept it out of the news.

334
00:17:48,843 --> 00:17:51,783
We should get out of here. I'm gonna
tell the cabby that we're ready to go.

335
00:17:51,818 --> 00:17:53,060
Ok.

336
00:18:00,185 --> 00:18:01,422
Hey,

337
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:03,044
Did you, uh,

338
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:06,290
Did you really see
Marla Seeger at the bar?

339
00:18:06,325 --> 00:18:08,376
I saw her with one man.

340
00:18:08,411 --> 00:18:10,814
I'm not sure if she left with him or not.

341
00:18:10,849 --> 00:18:12,478
Was it this guy?

342
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:18,033
That's him. I'm positive.

343
00:18:18,068 --> 00:18:19,380
Now go.

344
00:18:19,415 --> 00:18:20,986
Cab's gone.

345
00:18:21,372 --> 00:18:22,533
What?

346
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,982
The cab... it's gone.

347
00:18:26,786 --> 00:18:28,697
Uh, here, hold that.

348
00:18:29,271 --> 00:18:30,660
Um...

349
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:33,618
I'll give $200

350
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:37,732
To the person that gives
us a ride back to our Hotel.

351
00:18:45,196 --> 00:18:46,848
Now, where's your car?

352
00:18:47,809 --> 00:18:49,544
Quiso decir quinientos...

353
00:18:49,579 --> 00:18:52,157
Dos ahora,
tres despues de que llegamos.

354
00:18:55,473 --> 00:18:57,817
We're lucky they didn't kill us
and dump our bodies in a ditch.

355
00:18:57,852 --> 00:18:59,300
That wasn't luck.

356
00:18:59,334 --> 00:19:02,376
The driver was happy to make
some honest money for a change.

357
00:19:02,411 --> 00:19:03,993
You read that?

358
00:19:04,028 --> 00:19:06,735
Yeah.
Speaking of big and flashy...

359
00:19:07,098 --> 00:19:09,583
I need you to find out
what Rader's up to.

360
00:19:09,618 --> 00:19:10,837
You want me to spy for you?

361
00:19:10,872 --> 00:19:13,075
No, I don't want you to spy for me.

362
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:16,227
I just want you to poke about a bit.
I'll do my own spying.

363
00:19:16,262 --> 00:19:19,173
All right. Well, it's just my opinion,
but I think that might be a little overkill.

364
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,774
Your opinion? I don't need your opinion.
I didn't ask for it.

365
00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:23,497
Just do it. All right?
All right.

366
00:19:33,804 --> 00:19:35,046
Wait here.

367
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:41,582
Oi! Oi! That's my daughter!

368
00:19:41,762 --> 00:19:43,368
Hey, she started...
That's my daughter.

369
00:19:43,403 --> 00:19:45,302
She started talking to me.
You're having a conversation

370
00:19:45,337 --> 00:19:47,036
With my teenage daughter!

371
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,899
She started talking to me.

372
00:19:49,614 --> 00:19:50,774
What?

373
00:19:50,809 --> 00:19:52,626
All right. Ok. I'm leaving.

374
00:19:53,481 --> 00:19:56,364
Dad, that was the guy
that Tyler's been Emailing.

375
00:19:56,399 --> 00:19:59,211
I know it was. And you shouldn't have
been talking to him, Emily. Bloody hell.

376
00:19:59,246 --> 00:20:01,787
- You never said I shouldn't talk to him.
- Well, what am I supposed to do?

377
00:20:01,821 --> 00:20:04,455
Tell you not to do every
potentially life-threatening thing?

378
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:06,327
No.
I figured if I kept him talking...

379
00:20:06,362 --> 00:20:07,874
This is the last thing I need, Emily.

380
00:20:07,909 --> 00:20:10,792
You know, I've got a con man
back in my Office!

381
00:20:10,827 --> 00:20:14,449
And I've got you behaving
like Nancy bloody Drew!

382
00:20:14,906 --> 00:20:17,417
I was just...
I was just trying to help.

383
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:21,034
Where are you going?

384
00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:26,847
Don't.

385
00:20:54,199 --> 00:20:55,364
Hi.

386
00:20:55,676 --> 00:20:57,331
I'm Lola.

387
00:20:57,774 --> 00:20:59,399
Jerry Conway.

388
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:00,680
Please.

389
00:21:03,668 --> 00:21:06,082
You're a very confident woman, Lola.

390
00:21:06,117 --> 00:21:08,399
I mean that in the most flattering way.

391
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:11,063
Well. Then color me flattered.

392
00:21:12,961 --> 00:21:15,270
So, how long you been a masseuse?

393
00:21:15,949 --> 00:21:18,432
Uh, just a couple of years.

394
00:21:18,499 --> 00:21:19,932
Really?

395
00:21:29,859 --> 00:21:32,824
No, seriously.
The last guy I dated was a complete nut job.

396
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:34,746
Oh, I've been there.
Oh. Really?

397
00:21:34,781 --> 00:21:36,445
Ok. Well...

398
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:39,516
You tell me about your last
psycho, I'll tell you about mine.

399
00:21:39,551 --> 00:21:42,012
Least interesting story does a body shot.

400
00:21:42,047 --> 00:21:43,488
You're on.

401
00:21:44,766 --> 00:21:48,000
I met this weird chick, Marla,
a couple nights ago.

402
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:52,598
Yes. The Hospitals trade blood with each other,
but Euclid Park's not at fault.

403
00:21:52,832 --> 00:21:56,183
I've been here 10 years. Yager's been
here 9. We've never had a problem.

404
00:21:56,218 --> 00:21:58,586
We're not the source of the tainted blood.

405
00:21:59,148 --> 00:22:00,929
How can you be sure?

406
00:22:01,621 --> 00:22:06,621
I mean, I can't imagine how.
There's been no change in procedure.

407
00:22:07,042 --> 00:22:09,316
There's been no change in procedure.

408
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:20,431
Lightman?

409
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:31,078
Ok. All right.

410
00:22:39,879 --> 00:22:43,325
Dr. Foster, here's the
blue file that you needed.

411
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,907
Sorry for the delay.

412
00:22:44,942 --> 00:22:46,758
- The blue file?
- Yeah.

413
00:22:47,543 --> 00:22:48,985
Thank you.

414
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:53,164
Do you know what this is, Mr. Dunst?

415
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,828
This is a file all about you...

416
00:22:55,863 --> 00:22:59,543
Background check, interviews with coworkers,
family, friends.

417
00:22:59,754 --> 00:23:04,304
My team compiled it. You know, we can
scour this to discover what you're hiding,

418
00:23:05,027 --> 00:23:07,535
But why don't you save us the time?

419
00:23:17,297 --> 00:23:20,343
Tomkins, the new driver in the Lab,
is a Felon.

420
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:23,797
He told Yager he left the conviction
off his job application.

421
00:23:23,832 --> 00:23:26,030
And I should have reported it, but...

422
00:23:26,601 --> 00:23:28,499
Maybe you should talk to him.

423
00:23:43,832 --> 00:23:45,135
Lola...

424
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,197
Hey. All right.

425
00:23:47,631 --> 00:23:50,535
He's married, goes online to meet women
while he's on Business trips.

426
00:23:50,569 --> 00:23:53,622
He's a schmuck, but he had nothing
to do with Marla's disappearance.

427
00:23:53,657 --> 00:23:55,052
Are you sure?
Positive.

428
00:23:55,087 --> 00:23:56,869
They met.
She left after like a minute.

429
00:23:56,904 --> 00:23:59,965
Uh, he says that she was crying and
talking to some couple in the lobby.

430
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,497
He seems truthful.

431
00:24:02,493 --> 00:24:05,447
I can't believe you told him I like
role-playing and dirty limericks,

432
00:24:05,482 --> 00:24:06,660
You...

433
00:24:06,694 --> 00:24:09,083
Don't knock it till you've tried it.

434
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:12,306
Hang on.

435
00:24:14,028 --> 00:24:15,786
You following me?

436
00:24:17,849 --> 00:24:20,485
You have a lovely friend...

437
00:24:20,931 --> 00:24:22,560
And daughter.

438
00:24:22,595 --> 00:24:25,642
Is that a threat? 'Cause you really
shouldn't be confusing on that.

439
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:28,138
Not at all, Dr. Lightman.

440
00:24:34,677 --> 00:24:35,837
Hey.

441
00:24:35,872 --> 00:24:39,388
You sent someone to follow me,
and they threatened my daughter.

442
00:24:39,634 --> 00:24:41,767
I didn't hire him.
Some people here do.

443
00:24:41,802 --> 00:24:44,298
Yeah, well,
so do the drug Cartels.

444
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:46,607
I warned you not to get involved.

445
00:24:46,993 --> 00:24:49,730
All right. 4 months ago,
another woman went missing,

446
00:24:49,765 --> 00:24:53,005
Just like Marla Seeger,
but this one turned up dead.

447
00:24:54,341 --> 00:24:57,197
Ok, listen.
I insist that you stop interfering. Ok?

448
00:24:57,347 --> 00:25:00,818
All right, the night Marla Seeger disappeared,
she met a man named Jerry Conway.

449
00:25:00,853 --> 00:25:03,841
Then she met a couple outside the bar.
Did you know that?

450
00:25:03,876 --> 00:25:05,797
There is no Case here.

451
00:25:05,832 --> 00:25:09,820
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a young
woman who killed her own mother. Ok?

452
00:25:09,855 --> 00:25:12,070
Hey.
Su madre la estaba abusando.

453
00:25:12,105 --> 00:25:14,832
No tiene­a otra opcion.
Usted lo haba­a hecho lo mismo.

454
00:25:15,199 --> 00:25:16,863
Por favor, quieto.

455
00:25:17,168 --> 00:25:19,406
Quieto. Ok?

456
00:25:20,484 --> 00:25:24,264
I think you should talk to this boy.
He's using his anger to hide something.

457
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:27,210
She's protecting him,
so just talk to the boy.

458
00:25:27,245 --> 00:25:28,557
All right?

459
00:25:31,077 --> 00:25:34,303
Lleala a la segunda sala, por favor.
Y tu?

460
00:25:34,338 --> 00:25:37,010
Te sientas, por favor.
Sientate.

461
00:25:37,889 --> 00:25:40,221
How many of your people are
involved in this Cover-Up?

462
00:25:40,256 --> 00:25:41,965
There is no Cover-up.
Yeah, there is.

463
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,693
You may not be a part of it, but
you know one exists, don't you?

464
00:25:47,299 --> 00:25:49,490
Ok. Ok.

465
00:25:50,041 --> 00:25:53,865
The couple that met Marla Seeger
say that she seemed unstable.

466
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,748
You talked to them?

467
00:25:55,783 --> 00:25:57,865
Yes. Well, who are they?

468
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:01,364
Dan and Stacy Felder.
But it's a dead end.

469
00:26:01,619 --> 00:26:03,682
You know, there is a case here.

470
00:26:03,717 --> 00:26:06,272
Actually, there's 2. But you
already knew that, didn't you?

471
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,085
You're lucky you survived this accident.

472
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,307
Why did you fail to mention your
Criminal history on your application?

473
00:26:14,342 --> 00:26:18,644
I was 19 when I stole that car.
If I say I'm a Felon, who's gonna hire me?

474
00:26:19,019 --> 00:26:21,082
They should have done a background check.

475
00:26:21,117 --> 00:26:23,725
You've been in Health Care for a while.

476
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:25,207
Do you enjoy it?

477
00:26:25,242 --> 00:26:27,158
It's very rewarding.

478
00:26:30,996 --> 00:26:32,367
I missed my calling.

479
00:26:32,402 --> 00:26:33,890
I should have been a paramedic.

480
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,859
I mean, the action, the glory...

481
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:37,207
I mean, this...

482
00:26:38,355 --> 00:26:40,101
That's real life-and-death stuff.

483
00:26:40,136 --> 00:26:41,847
It's not too late. Heh.

484
00:26:41,882 --> 00:26:45,591
Yeah. I'm too old. I don't know
how we get to where we're going.

485
00:26:45,626 --> 00:26:47,559
Are we even aware of our choices?

486
00:26:47,953 --> 00:26:49,301
What, are they just chatting?

487
00:26:49,336 --> 00:26:51,117
We're just getting a baseline right now.

488
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:53,437
You know,
let me ask you something.

489
00:26:54,105 --> 00:26:57,359
Was your "aha" moment
when you stole that car?

490
00:26:58,195 --> 00:27:00,598
I don't understand the question.

491
00:27:00,633 --> 00:27:04,183
You stole that car and got into an
accident with a 23-year-old kid.

492
00:27:04,535 --> 00:27:08,168
The Police found you
cradling his mangled body.

493
00:27:08,203 --> 00:27:10,500
I mean, did you get into Health
Care because you realized

494
00:27:10,535 --> 00:27:13,425
You could be around blood and
guts and death all the time?

495
00:27:13,582 --> 00:27:17,332
That you wouldn't have to cause an
accident to get sexually stimulated?

496
00:27:18,562 --> 00:27:21,375
Uh-oh.
Sicko alert.

497
00:27:23,355 --> 00:27:25,394
Pupils dilated.
He's aroused.

498
00:27:25,429 --> 00:27:27,469
From talking about blood and guts?

499
00:27:27,504 --> 00:27:29,285
Yeah.
They've sussed that out.

500
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:32,906
What did you put in the blood
at Euclid Park Hospital?

501
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:35,174
- Nothing.
- You want people to suffer

502
00:27:35,208 --> 00:27:36,469
And die at your hand.

503
00:27:36,504 --> 00:27:38,976
I swear I had nothing to
do with the tainted blood.

504
00:27:39,011 --> 00:27:41,402
I never did anything at Euclid Park.

505
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:48,972
Speech pattern's back to baseline.

506
00:27:49,007 --> 00:27:51,082
He's probably telling the truth.

507
00:27:51,363 --> 00:27:53,467
So, we're back to square one,

508
00:27:53,501 --> 00:27:54,972
Again.

509
00:27:58,418 --> 00:27:59,754
Why are you being so hard on yourself?

510
00:27:59,789 --> 00:28:02,871
People are dying, and I can't stop thinking
about that little boy with Sickle Cell,

511
00:28:02,906 --> 00:28:04,996
And I have nothing for the CDC.
Gillian...

512
00:28:05,031 --> 00:28:06,836
You know, if Cal were here,
he would have solved this by now.

513
00:28:06,871 --> 00:28:08,969
I should have just made him come back.
Hey.

514
00:28:09,004 --> 00:28:10,586
We can do this. Ok?

515
00:28:10,621 --> 00:28:12,660
Excuse me.
You can't come in here. Jack.

516
00:28:13,633 --> 00:28:15,459
McKenzie!
How did you get in here?

517
00:28:15,494 --> 00:28:18,676
I'm a Reporter who talked her
way into Attica once, remember?

518
00:28:18,711 --> 00:28:22,123
Scheduled surgeries are being canceled
all over D.C. with no explanation.

519
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:24,125
Something's going on at the CDC.

520
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,092
And when a little bird told me you were
partnering with the Lightman group,

521
00:28:27,127 --> 00:28:28,702
My Reporter antenna went off.

522
00:28:28,736 --> 00:28:30,559
Heh heh. McKenzie, darling,

523
00:28:30,594 --> 00:28:33,224
You have uncanny timing.
Let me fill you in.

524
00:28:33,549 --> 00:28:35,792
Can we do it on camera?
Heh heh.

525
00:29:01,141 --> 00:29:04,424
Oh, yeah. Thank you very much.
I'll tell him. All right. Thanks.

526
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:08,909
So, a woman named Ramona Posner came here
alone from Miami about 4 months ago.

527
00:29:08,944 --> 00:29:12,084
10 days after she disappeared,
she was found dead in an alley Downtown.

528
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:14,861
State Department and Local Police
ruled it an accident.

529
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,959
Well, a cynic might call it a pattern.

530
00:29:17,994 --> 00:29:19,792
Yeah.
Oh, by the way,

531
00:29:19,827 --> 00:29:21,951
Rader seems to be making quite
an impression at the Office.

532
00:29:21,986 --> 00:29:23,861
Is he, now?
Mm-Hmm. According to Loker,

533
00:29:23,896 --> 00:29:25,726
Foster seems a bit gaga over him.

534
00:29:25,761 --> 00:29:27,236
Lovely.

535
00:29:27,271 --> 00:29:28,513
Oh, my God.
What?

536
00:29:28,548 --> 00:29:30,154
Is that jealousy?
No.

537
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:35,586
Where are you going?

538
00:29:36,852 --> 00:29:41,392
I left my hat out by the pool.
Don't worry, I won't do anything childish.

539
00:29:44,265 --> 00:29:47,371
Why don't you take your extraordinary
powers of observation down to the pool

540
00:29:47,406 --> 00:29:49,480
And use them to keep an eye on Emily?

541
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,605
You're jealous.

542
00:29:59,851 --> 00:30:01,621
Marla came up to us in the lobby.

543
00:30:01,656 --> 00:30:04,351
She said,
"I hope you experience the great joy I have,"

544
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:06,332
And then she left.
It was bizarre.

545
00:30:06,367 --> 00:30:08,746
You work with the Police, right?

546
00:30:08,781 --> 00:30:10,562
I mean,
didn't they tell you this already?

547
00:30:10,597 --> 00:30:13,293
Yeah, but I wanted to hear this from you two.

548
00:30:13,328 --> 00:30:17,424
Mrs Felder, do you have any idea why
she would approach you like that?

549
00:30:18,203 --> 00:30:19,480
No.

550
00:30:20,758 --> 00:30:22,117
Not true.

551
00:30:22,433 --> 00:30:24,225
We're gonna be late for the Airport.

552
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,492
Here.

553
00:30:25,738 --> 00:30:27,332
No, I'll hold that.

554
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,277
No, I'll get it. I'll get it.

555
00:30:31,691 --> 00:30:34,392
You know, you're never gonna
get that through Customs.

556
00:30:34,427 --> 00:30:35,759
Why not?
Because I'm gonna call them.

557
00:30:35,826 --> 00:30:38,359
I'm gonna tell them
you got a suspicious package.

558
00:30:38,394 --> 00:30:41,605
That's the kind of pain in the ass
I can be if I don't get the truth.

559
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,969
Look, it was just a hunch.

560
00:30:48,226 --> 00:30:52,027
There's a Fertility Treatment Center here
that matches egg donors with couples.

561
00:30:52,062 --> 00:30:55,707
We're from Canada and it's illegal
to purchase eggs there.

562
00:30:55,742 --> 00:31:00,429
The donors stay anonymous, but they
can choose who they want to donate to.

563
00:31:00,464 --> 00:31:02,386
These are our frozen embryos.

564
00:31:02,421 --> 00:31:04,836
So you thought that Marla
Seeger was your egg donor.

565
00:31:04,871 --> 00:31:07,232
Yeah, for a moment.
But then we realized that it couldn't be her.

566
00:31:07,267 --> 00:31:10,767
She was nothing like the person
the Broker described to us.

567
00:31:19,824 --> 00:31:21,360
Hey.

568
00:31:21,395 --> 00:31:23,164
Did you find my mom?

569
00:31:23,199 --> 00:31:24,559
No, love.

570
00:31:24,626 --> 00:31:25,906
Not yet.

571
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,382
Well, that's lovely.

572
00:31:30,416 --> 00:31:33,118
Welcome to the age when they need you
but think they're smarter than you.

573
00:31:33,153 --> 00:31:35,508
Well, she always was.

574
00:31:37,032 --> 00:31:39,587
All right,
I've got one for you.

575
00:31:39,622 --> 00:31:43,688
Marla Seeger was a waitress
in a diner, right?

576
00:31:43,723 --> 00:31:45,422
And, uh...

577
00:31:45,891 --> 00:31:49,817
Ramona Posner was a Teacher's aide.

578
00:31:49,852 --> 00:31:54,158
How do two women like that
afford fabulous trips to Zulia?

579
00:31:54,193 --> 00:31:55,559
How?

580
00:31:55,594 --> 00:31:56,868
Well...

581
00:31:57,712 --> 00:31:59,492
Marla Seeger...

582
00:31:59,634 --> 00:32:01,392
Came here as an egg donor.

583
00:32:01,427 --> 00:32:03,735
She was giving herself Hormone injections.

584
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:05,728
Right.
And the needles that the Cops found.

585
00:32:05,763 --> 00:32:07,896
Hence the mood swings.

586
00:32:11,025 --> 00:32:12,993
- Hi, can I help you?
- Cal Lightman?

587
00:32:13,058 --> 00:32:14,626
Yeah, he's here.

588
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:16,926
Just the man I wanted to see.

589
00:32:16,993 --> 00:32:19,767
You need to call in some of
those Embassy resources.

590
00:32:19,802 --> 00:32:24,492
Can't. Someone from the Police Department
called my Boss. I've been reassigned.

591
00:32:27,103 --> 00:32:28,767
And threatened.

592
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,089
Our egg donors have high IQs,
are from stable backgrounds.

593
00:32:34,124 --> 00:32:36,491
They don't have drug, alcohol,
or mental health problems,

594
00:32:36,526 --> 00:32:38,343
And many of them are star Athletes.

595
00:32:38,378 --> 00:32:40,576
How specific can we be
in how the donors look?

596
00:32:40,611 --> 00:32:43,593
I have a couple here,
they're seeking someone at least 5'9",

597
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,109
Blond, blue-eyed, Athletic,
and an Ivy League School.

598
00:32:46,144 --> 00:32:48,907
We found a match yesterday.
It's only 50,000

599
00:32:48,942 --> 00:32:50,946
In the States,
it would be double that.

600
00:32:50,981 --> 00:32:52,599
We're in here.

601
00:32:53,045 --> 00:32:55,166
How do you harvest the eggs, then?

602
00:32:55,646 --> 00:32:58,944
Our reproductive Endocrinologist,
Dr. Alvarez,

603
00:32:59,287 --> 00:33:01,479
He's responsible for everything.

604
00:33:01,514 --> 00:33:03,032
Right.

605
00:33:03,066 --> 00:33:04,432
How much do you pay the donors?

606
00:33:04,467 --> 00:33:07,532
The fee is generous.
Plus they get a free trip to Zulia.

607
00:33:07,567 --> 00:33:09,559
But no one does it for the money.

608
00:33:09,594 --> 00:33:12,711
They just want to help
the right couples have a child.

609
00:33:12,746 --> 00:33:14,055
That's wonderful.

610
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:15,309
That's wonderful.
Yeah, it's great.

611
00:33:15,344 --> 00:33:19,592
We actually are looking for a donor
with blue eyes and light-brown hair.

612
00:33:19,627 --> 00:33:21,549
And 5'6".

613
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:28,444
I think I can arrange that.

614
00:33:28,955 --> 00:33:31,018
Thought you were gonna say that.

615
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,936
Oh, Dr. Alvarez,
these are the garrs.

616
00:33:33,971 --> 00:33:35,764
Pleased to meet you.

617
00:33:36,151 --> 00:33:38,330
May I have a minute with you, please?

618
00:33:38,365 --> 00:33:39,977
Can it wait?

619
00:33:41,143 --> 00:33:43,278
Oh, no, no.
We've gotta shove off anyway.

620
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:45,022
- Yeah, we gotta go.
- We've got to think about it.

621
00:33:45,057 --> 00:33:46,967
Yes. I mean,
it's a big decision.

622
00:33:47,002 --> 00:33:48,192
Yeah.

623
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:50,736
I've got a question for you,
Dr. Alvarez.

624
00:33:50,771 --> 00:33:53,338
Um, we've been told that
my wife's infertility

625
00:33:53,373 --> 00:33:57,678
Is due to an Estrogen imbalance
caused by the Coriolis effect.

626
00:33:57,745 --> 00:33:59,322
Is that possible?

627
00:33:59,357 --> 00:34:01,502
That could very well be true.

628
00:34:01,713 --> 00:34:04,409
Did you see Wynn when I described Marla?
Flared nostrils, quick breath?

629
00:34:04,444 --> 00:34:05,486
Yeah, he's in this.

630
00:34:05,521 --> 00:34:07,466
There's no way all those donors
fit the criteria he described.

631
00:34:07,501 --> 00:34:09,552
Oh, wait.
See, they don't have to.

632
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:12,868
They find donors like Marla Seeger
who are desperate for money.

633
00:34:12,903 --> 00:34:15,447
They insist the donors remain anonymous.

634
00:34:15,482 --> 00:34:17,378
Wynn can give the buyers
any description he wants.

635
00:34:17,444 --> 00:34:19,783
- It's a con.
- Yeah, absolutely it's a con.

636
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,953
Isn't the Coriolis effect
something about the Earth's rotation?

637
00:34:24,988 --> 00:34:27,323
- Yeah, exactly.
- Alvarez agreed with your theory.

638
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:29,491
Yeah. That's because
Alvarez is not a Doctor.

639
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:30,944
He's a fake.

640
00:34:32,386 --> 00:34:35,545
I'm in charge of blood orders here,
and Yager coordinates Trades.

641
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,993
For the other Hospitals in DC.

642
00:34:37,028 --> 00:34:40,977
So why did I have to
reinterview these two guys?

643
00:34:41,668 --> 00:34:44,153
Because we've got nothing else.

644
00:34:44,188 --> 00:34:45,544
Well...

645
00:34:45,887 --> 00:34:48,102
He's exhibiting extreme control.

646
00:34:48,137 --> 00:34:49,790
I guess he could still be hiding something.

647
00:34:49,825 --> 00:34:52,848
No, voice pitch is steady.
Dunst isn't lying.

648
00:34:52,883 --> 00:34:56,809
But why does Yager keep looking behind him?
And why is he anxious?

649
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:59,044
What'd I miss?

650
00:34:59,416 --> 00:35:00,776
What happened to the Reporter?

651
00:35:00,811 --> 00:35:02,135
I took care of her.

652
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:04,350
That could mean so many things.

653
00:35:04,842 --> 00:35:07,111
So the story won't be on the News?

654
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:09,284
That's what you wanted,
isn't it?

655
00:35:09,319 --> 00:35:14,206
What, did Cal brainwash you into thinking I'm
some kind of Media whore without scruples?

656
00:35:14,241 --> 00:35:17,976
Come on, guys, tell me you got something,
'cause the Tox screen's all negative so far.

657
00:35:18,011 --> 00:35:21,044
And the CDC is getting all
kind of calls from Reporters.

658
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:24,184
I can charm one Reporter,
I can't control the entire fourth Estate.

659
00:35:25,203 --> 00:35:28,278
Uh, we had the 5-car pile-up on the beltway...

660
00:35:28,508 --> 00:35:29,973
Wait.

661
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:32,144
Something's different.

662
00:35:32,179 --> 00:35:34,075
Oh, I had to change the battery,

663
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,504
So we took a little break.

664
00:35:35,539 --> 00:35:39,559
But they're both more relaxed now,
and Yager's not looking behind him.

665
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:43,438
Go back to before the break.

666
00:35:47,399 --> 00:35:49,309
He was looking at that.

667
00:35:52,051 --> 00:35:53,961
They got rid of it.

668
00:35:53,996 --> 00:35:56,270
Why didn't they want us to see it?

669
00:36:06,676 --> 00:36:09,102
Dr. Foster.
What can we do for you?

670
00:36:09,137 --> 00:36:11,478
We need to take a look around.

671
00:36:11,938 --> 00:36:13,944
How often do you give blood?

672
00:36:13,979 --> 00:36:17,236
Every 6 weeks or so. I have a rare
blood type. What are you looking for?

673
00:36:17,271 --> 00:36:19,228
- Found it.
- That's sensitive equipment.

674
00:36:19,263 --> 00:36:20,544
What's it for?

675
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:22,561
Processing patient fluid samples.

676
00:36:22,596 --> 00:36:24,542
Could you be any more vague?

677
00:36:26,604 --> 00:36:29,265
It's positive for narcotics.

678
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,468
So you've been running a drug Lab down here.

679
00:36:38,065 --> 00:36:39,413
Hola.

680
00:36:39,448 --> 00:36:41,487
Hola. ¿Que tal?
Hey.

681
00:36:41,921 --> 00:36:44,044
Where's Marla Seeger?

682
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:47,294
- I don't know who that is.
- Not true.

683
00:36:47,598 --> 00:36:49,544
You're the couple from
the Office today, no?

684
00:36:49,579 --> 00:36:52,638
Your partner Wynn sold you out,
made a deal with the Police.

685
00:36:52,673 --> 00:36:54,958
He said the Scam was your idea.

686
00:36:55,485 --> 00:36:57,724
He never said that.

687
00:36:57,759 --> 00:37:00,278
Dr. Alvarez is responsible for everything.

688
00:37:03,091 --> 00:37:05,414
- That's a lie.
- No, I can assure you it's perfectly true.

689
00:37:05,449 --> 00:37:07,441
What happened to her?

690
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,023
She was one of our egg donors.

691
00:37:12,246 --> 00:37:14,871
She wasn't doing well on
the Hormone treatments.

692
00:37:14,906 --> 00:37:18,843
She wanted to get the procedure over with.
But then she called to change her mind.

693
00:37:18,878 --> 00:37:21,211
Wynn brought her in anyway.
This is all his doing.

694
00:37:21,246 --> 00:37:22,992
What happened to Marla?

695
00:37:24,578 --> 00:37:27,742
I started the egg extraction,
but there were complications

696
00:37:27,777 --> 00:37:29,754
And I punctured something.

697
00:37:29,953 --> 00:37:31,933
She started to bleed.

698
00:37:32,402 --> 00:37:33,890
So where is she?

699
00:37:35,566 --> 00:37:37,734
Wynn has an apartment.

700
00:37:37,769 --> 00:37:39,375
She's dying.

701
00:37:44,683 --> 00:37:46,254
One more day,
we would have lost her.

702
00:37:46,289 --> 00:37:47,531
Yeah.

703
00:37:48,339 --> 00:37:51,117
Listen, how did you know that
I wasn't part of the Coverup?

704
00:37:51,363 --> 00:37:56,363
When I accused you,
you showed genuine anger, not guilt.

705
00:37:58,849 --> 00:38:02,658
Listen, about that man you
sent to threaten my daughter.

706
00:38:02,693 --> 00:38:04,796
That wasn't me,
that was my Boss.

707
00:38:08,089 --> 00:38:10,585
You sure this man was
part of the Cartels?

708
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:13,573
If I was you, I'd keep him
away from the Evidence locker.

709
00:38:15,413 --> 00:38:18,182
I'll keep an eye on my Boss, too.

710
00:38:22,948 --> 00:38:26,347
Rader and Foster busted a drug Lab.
He's saying she's brilliant and has...

711
00:38:26,382 --> 00:38:28,562
All right, keep it to yourself, huh?

712
00:38:28,796 --> 00:38:30,530
Uh, Lou from the Embassy
asked me to stick around...

713
00:38:30,565 --> 00:38:32,628
Lou from the Embassy?
That's Lou from the Embassy. That's nice.

714
00:38:32,663 --> 00:38:34,913
Yeah, he asked me to stick
around for a couple extra days.

715
00:38:34,948 --> 00:38:36,237
So I said yeah.
Is that all right?

716
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:39,150
And here I was thinking
we were happily married.

717
00:38:39,683 --> 00:38:42,577
The two Techs were making
designer Fentanyl in the Hospital Lab.

718
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:44,886
They were using the blood
as a means of transport.

719
00:38:44,921 --> 00:38:47,687
Yeah. Liquid Fentanyl
was injected into the blood bags,

720
00:38:47,722 --> 00:38:51,334
Which would then be delivered to all the
Heroin processing Centers in the City.

721
00:38:51,369 --> 00:38:53,174
A Lab within a Lab.

722
00:38:53,209 --> 00:38:54,791
Pretty ingenious. Problem was,

723
00:38:54,826 --> 00:38:57,100
The new guy Tomkins picked up
the wrong bags one day.

724
00:38:57,135 --> 00:39:00,337
And the Fentanyl never triggered
any alarms in the patient Tox screen

725
00:39:00,372 --> 00:39:03,701
Because it's a common
Anesthetic used for surgery.

726
00:39:03,736 --> 00:39:05,341
Sorry I'm late.

727
00:39:05,775 --> 00:39:07,449
They filled you in?
Well,

728
00:39:07,484 --> 00:39:09,888
I guess we'll reopen the Central blood Bank

729
00:39:09,923 --> 00:39:13,509
And track down all the units
that left Euclid Park Hospital.

730
00:39:13,943 --> 00:39:15,466
Thanks to you.

731
00:39:18,783 --> 00:39:22,781
By the way, you should both know that I taped
an Interview with McKenzie Dodd about the Case.

732
00:39:22,816 --> 00:39:25,418
Should be airing in about an hour.

733
00:39:27,318 --> 00:39:28,982
How could you do that?

734
00:39:29,252 --> 00:39:31,631
The CDC hasn't had the Press Conference.

735
00:39:31,666 --> 00:39:33,365
Oh, I forgot.

736
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,596
You love the spotlight.

737
00:39:34,631 --> 00:39:36,869
I promised an exlcusive to buy us time.

738
00:39:36,904 --> 00:39:39,380
This was all about getting back at Cal
and the Lightman group, wasn't it?

739
00:39:39,415 --> 00:39:40,587
Gillian...

740
00:39:41,483 --> 00:39:43,985
You know me too well.

741
00:39:46,695 --> 00:39:48,050
It was fun.

742
00:39:48,116 --> 00:39:49,496
Bye, Jack.

743
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:56,656
Here's my card.

744
00:39:57,488 --> 00:40:00,160
In case you plan on making a life change.

745
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,888
Thanks, man.

746
00:40:05,923 --> 00:40:09,357
Well, it's been a very tense time,
but the threat has been eliminated.

747
00:40:09,392 --> 00:40:13,210
Dr. Cho credits you with helping a
little boy with Sickle Cell Anemia.

748
00:40:14,042 --> 00:40:15,800
I knew he was slick, but, man...

749
00:40:15,835 --> 00:40:18,349
You were the first person
that the CDC turned to for help.

750
00:40:18,384 --> 00:40:21,406
Could I just say that I owe a debt
of gratitude to Dr. Gillian Foster,

751
00:40:21,441 --> 00:40:24,219
Who really cracked this Case.
This potential Health disaster

752
00:40:24,254 --> 00:40:26,441
Wouldn't have been averted without her.

753
00:40:36,449 --> 00:40:37,877
Mommy!

754
00:40:54,211 --> 00:40:58,881
So you're saying that you can just treat
me like a child whenever you want to.

755
00:40:58,916 --> 00:41:02,408
No, I'm not.
I'm saying that on occasion,

756
00:41:02,443 --> 00:41:06,403
It's my right as a parent to be
suspicious and overprotective.

757
00:41:06,438 --> 00:41:08,981
Ok. Then on occasion,
I reserve the right

758
00:41:09,016 --> 00:41:12,239
To throw Tantrums and spend all your money.

759
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,547
Deal.

760
00:41:15,907 --> 00:41:19,734
Now, if you're done forcing me to work,
can I have my Holiday back, please?

761
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:25,883
How do you learn to live longer?

762
00:41:25,918 --> 00:41:28,981
Well, there's Meditation and Yoga,

763
00:41:29,016 --> 00:41:32,022
But for you,
I'd definitely say do both.

764
00:41:32,057 --> 00:41:35,069
Yoga's that thing you do in a lounge
chair with a Mai-Tai in your hand, right?

765
00:41:35,104 --> 00:41:37,049
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

766
00:41:43,817 --> 00:41:45,282
Hey! Hey.

767
00:41:45,317 --> 00:41:47,743
"Don't hate me too much because
I'm filled with admiration."

768
00:41:47,778 --> 00:41:49,325
Give it to me.

769
00:41:49,806 --> 00:41:51,716
So who sent the flowers, then?

770
00:41:51,751 --> 00:41:53,380
'Cause you know I'm the jealous type.

771
00:41:53,415 --> 00:41:54,669
Welcome home, Cal.

772
00:41:54,704 --> 00:41:56,842
Rumor has it you never even left Town,
but that can't be true

773
00:41:56,877 --> 00:41:58,560
Because you look like a different man.

774
00:41:58,595 --> 00:42:00,188
I feel like a different man.

775
00:42:00,223 --> 00:42:02,110
You know,
a vacation's a wonderful thing.

776
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:04,083
6 days of nothing.

777
00:42:04,118 --> 00:42:06,142
Well, I heard you were working on a Case.

778
00:42:06,177 --> 00:42:08,204
Well, it barely qualifies as a Case.

779
00:42:08,778 --> 00:42:10,735
I feel so relaxed that...

780
00:42:11,104 --> 00:42:13,724
I don't even care that Rader was here.

781
00:42:14,813 --> 00:42:16,454
Then Torres told you.

782
00:42:16,489 --> 00:42:18,036
Well...

783
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:22,173
So, uh,
he sent you the flowers, then?

784
00:42:22,735 --> 00:42:23,872
Yep.

785
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:27,709
Have you checked them for Aphids?

786
00:42:29,186 --> 00:42:30,908
No, no, I don't care.

787
00:42:30,943 --> 00:42:33,323
But did he see any of my research?

788
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:35,584
I kept him out of your Library.

789
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:37,518
Oh. And is everyone still here?

790
00:42:37,553 --> 00:42:38,807
He didn't poach anyone.

791
00:42:38,842 --> 00:42:41,655
And did he break into
the Office supply closet?

792
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:43,975
He definitely didn't do that.
Except one thing...

793
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:46,649
The sprinkler system
was acting up a little bit.

794
00:42:47,268 --> 00:42:48,883
That's odd.

795
00:42:49,893 --> 00:42:52,764
What exactly happened between you and Rader?

796
00:42:53,139 --> 00:42:54,649
Oh, I'd tell you,

797
00:42:54,716 --> 00:42:56,877
But you'd think I was lying.

798
00:42:58,401 --> 00:43:00,217
Loker. My card.

799
00:43:00,252 --> 00:43:03,152
Just in case you're thinking
of making a life change.
