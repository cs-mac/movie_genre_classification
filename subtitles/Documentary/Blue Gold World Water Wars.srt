2
00:00:16,594 --> 00:00:17,545
<i>Danger looms!</i>

3
00:00:18,074 --> 00:00:20,343
<i>Despite recent victories
in the Outer Rim,</i>

4
00:00:20,468 --> 00:00:23,356
<i>criminal minds plot
at the very heart of the Republic.</i>

5
00:00:23,659 --> 00:00:25,459
<i>The bounty hunter Cad Bane</i>

6
00:00:25,594 --> 00:00:28,152
<i>has assembled some
of the deadliest criminals in the galaxy</i>

7
00:00:28,427 --> 00:00:32,174
<i>and plans a daring attack
to seize members of the Senate.</i>

8
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:34,575
<i>What could be the aim
of this despicable act?</i>

9
00:00:36,335 --> 00:00:37,385
Here we go.

10
00:00:39,741 --> 00:00:42,333
<i>Attention, attention.
This is a restricted area.</i>

11
00:00:42,657 --> 00:00:45,086
<i>No landing is permitted
without permission.</i>

12
00:00:45,255 --> 00:00:48,755
<i>Violators will be prosecuted
to the full extend of the law.</i>

13
00:00:51,294 --> 00:00:52,332
Put up your hands.

14
00:00:53,968 --> 00:00:56,302
I've got business with the Senate.

15
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,599
You better step aside.

16
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,643
On your knees. Raise your hands.

17
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,620
Slowly.

18
00:01:03,307 --> 00:01:04,307
Son,

19
00:01:04,838 --> 00:01:07,650
I wouldn't be so hasty
if I were you.

20
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:09,135
Cuff him.

21
00:01:13,649 --> 00:01:16,534
- Where's that coming from?
- I see the shooter up in the tower.

22
00:01:38,177 --> 00:01:41,684
You two, get these uniforms on
and get this platform clear.

23
00:01:49,251 --> 00:01:52,204
<i>Base to platform,
what was all that? Report.</i>

24
00:01:52,815 --> 00:01:55,489
Protesters against the war,
we've taken care of them.

25
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:11,394
Finish getting those uniforms on
and clear this platform now.

26
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,903
Everybody else,

27
00:02:13,784 --> 00:02:14,785
follow me.

28
00:02:22,872 --> 00:02:25,410
I'm supposed to be
on a meditative retreat.

29
00:02:25,535 --> 00:02:27,407
We should go away together.

30
00:02:27,532 --> 00:02:30,980
I know a place far from here
where no one would recognise us.

31
00:02:31,105 --> 00:02:33,283
It would be like
we're actually husband and wife,

32
00:02:33,408 --> 00:02:35,898
instead of Senator and Jedi.

33
00:02:37,162 --> 00:02:39,783
- I can't, Ani.
- What do you mean you can't?

34
00:02:39,908 --> 00:02:41,408
It's only two weeks,

35
00:02:41,533 --> 00:02:43,871
we'll be back before anyone
even notices we're gone.

36
00:02:44,347 --> 00:02:47,583
I have to bring this bill
before the Senate. It's important.

37
00:02:49,163 --> 00:02:52,068
More important
than the way you feel about me?

38
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:55,563
Not more important, but important.

39
00:02:55,911 --> 00:02:58,719
The work I do, the work we both do,

40
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,724
is in service to the Republic.

41
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:04,033
To protect those who would otherwise
be powerless to protect themselves.

42
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:06,258
Of course. But those are ideals.

43
00:03:06,783 --> 00:03:08,646
Isn't our love
more important to you?

44
00:03:09,094 --> 00:03:10,944
- But I...
- No, no "but".

45
00:03:11,513 --> 00:03:12,533
To me

46
00:03:12,663 --> 00:03:15,765
there's nothing more important
than the way I feel about you.

47
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:16,779
Nothing.

48
00:03:17,184 --> 00:03:20,025
- Anakin, don't be so...
- You don't believe me.

49
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,970
- I didn't say...
- I'll prove it.

50
00:03:22,095 --> 00:03:22,993
Just watch.

51
00:03:23,358 --> 00:03:27,037
When I finished constructing
my lightsaber, Obi-Wan said to me

52
00:03:27,162 --> 00:03:30,310
"Anakin, this weapon is your life."

53
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:33,778
This weapon is my life.

54
00:03:33,903 --> 00:03:37,591
No, Anakin, I can't.
A Jedi lightsaber is...

55
00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:43,809
It's heavier than I thought.

56
00:03:44,369 --> 00:03:45,457
It's yours.

57
00:03:46,223 --> 00:03:47,254
Believe me now?

58
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:50,471
If all you want to do
is make fun of me,

59
00:03:50,596 --> 00:03:53,065
- I think you should just go.
- That's not what I want.

60
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:55,046
Not at all.

61
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:12,208
Stop!

62
00:04:24,242 --> 00:04:25,742
You know what to do.

63
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:28,475
I'll figure it out.

64
00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:31,896
You better not fail me,
bubble brain.

65
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:36,066
Don't worry,
I'll have the power out in no time.

66
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:38,360
The rest of you come with me.

67
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:44,890
But Senator Organa,
it just wouldn't be...

68
00:04:45,015 --> 00:04:46,115
Quick, hide!

69
00:04:47,715 --> 00:04:49,146
Now stand aside.

70
00:04:50,225 --> 00:04:51,790
I apologise for my abruptness.

71
00:04:52,474 --> 00:04:54,774
Senator Organa, how good to see you.

72
00:04:55,255 --> 00:04:56,128
What is it?

73
00:04:56,449 --> 00:04:58,838
Senator Filo has called
a meeting in the lobby

74
00:04:58,963 --> 00:05:01,175
before we vote
on the Enhanced Privacy Invasion Bill.

75
00:05:01,798 --> 00:05:04,386
Right, Privacy Invasion Bill.

76
00:05:04,926 --> 00:05:07,526
We must hurry
if we are to stop the vote.

77
00:05:08,673 --> 00:05:10,226
Coming, Senator Amidala?

78
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,790
Of course.

79
00:05:24,107 --> 00:05:25,107
Quietly...

80
00:05:26,989 --> 00:05:29,799
Guard change happens now.

81
00:05:34,857 --> 00:05:35,907
Here we go.

82
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,895
Now lets go talk to some senators.

83
00:05:57,028 --> 00:05:57,856
Help me.

84
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,474
We can not allow the Chancellor

85
00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:07,475
to move this Enhanced Privacy
Invasion Bill forward.

86
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,550
We are all in agreement then.

87
00:06:11,534 --> 00:06:13,205
Morning, Senators.

88
00:06:13,837 --> 00:06:17,356
You should all consider yourselves
to be in my power.

89
00:06:18,522 --> 00:06:22,381
As long as everybody behaves
this will be quick and painless.

90
00:06:22,911 --> 00:06:26,301
Do nothing
and it will all be over soon.

91
00:06:26,883 --> 00:06:29,323
I don't know who you think you are

92
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:34,282
but I for one have no intention
of listening to this kind of insolence.

93
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,232
All right then.

94
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,027
If you all gather at the center
of this lovely atrium

95
00:06:43,383 --> 00:06:48,198
my co-workers and I will relieve you
of any communication devices.

96
00:06:48,882 --> 00:06:51,210
I see five of them here in the room.
If we...

97
00:06:51,335 --> 00:06:54,735
What are you going to do?
It's not like we carry weapons.

98
00:06:58,723 --> 00:07:00,169
Chancellor Palpatine.

99
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:02,737
What is it, Senator Free Taa?

100
00:07:03,537 --> 00:07:05,437
I think you should see this.

101
00:07:06,034 --> 00:07:07,801
<i>Sorry to bother you, Chancellor,</i>

102
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:11,847
<i>but I've taken control of the east wing
of your Senate building.</i>

103
00:07:12,016 --> 00:07:15,020
<i>The occupants are now my hostages.</i>

104
00:07:15,353 --> 00:07:16,911
<i>If you care about them,</i>

105
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:20,981
<i>I'd advise you to free Ziro the Hutt
from the detention center.</i>

106
00:07:21,488 --> 00:07:25,069
You should know that the Republic
does not take kindly to such threats.

107
00:07:25,328 --> 00:07:29,239
If you have attempted such a fool-hardy
action as to kidnap a senator,

108
00:07:29,547 --> 00:07:32,851
I assure you it will be met
with appropriate force.

109
00:07:33,831 --> 00:07:35,756
This ought to do it.

110
00:07:44,165 --> 00:07:45,214
What's going on?

111
00:07:45,645 --> 00:07:46,924
<i>I'm in control,</i>

112
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:48,719
<i>I make the rules now.</i>

113
00:07:53,663 --> 00:07:56,063
Orn Free Taa,
help me with this door.

114
00:07:56,669 --> 00:07:58,077
It's no use, sir.

115
00:07:58,393 --> 00:08:01,036
Someone's gotten
into the central control panel.

116
00:08:01,161 --> 00:08:03,611
They've triggered
the security system.

117
00:08:03,972 --> 00:08:06,276
The Senate buildings
have sealed themselves.

118
00:08:07,394 --> 00:08:09,344
This is Chancellor Palpatine,

119
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:12,032
there is an emergency
at the Senate building.

120
00:08:12,357 --> 00:08:14,200
Jedi Council, come in.

121
00:08:14,615 --> 00:08:15,786
Is anyone there?

122
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:17,784
That's no use either, sir.

123
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:21,009
They've cut off all communication
with the outside.

124
00:08:24,802 --> 00:08:28,309
Hand over your communication devices
please.

125
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,182
- I can't let them search me.
- What?

126
00:08:37,498 --> 00:08:38,296
Why not?

127
00:08:38,538 --> 00:08:41,876
- I have something they must not find.
- What is it?

128
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,612
Hello there little lady.

129
00:08:45,975 --> 00:08:47,630
And who might you be?

130
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,825
I am Padmé Amidala.

131
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,271
Senator from Naboo.

132
00:08:51,396 --> 00:08:53,528
And I demand
that you release us immediately.

133
00:08:53,653 --> 00:08:55,868
The Galactic Senate
will not treat with with terrorists.

134
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:59,788
Ain't you awful young
and pretty to be a senator?

135
00:09:07,893 --> 00:09:10,174
Skywalker?! After him!

136
00:09:16,778 --> 00:09:18,515
Hello, come in. Anyone there?

137
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:44,518
This is General Skywalker,

138
00:10:44,643 --> 00:10:46,539
Chancellor Palpatine,
can you hear me?

139
00:10:46,664 --> 00:10:47,764
My dear boy,

140
00:10:47,915 --> 00:10:50,065
I'm glad to know
you're there and all right.

141
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:52,974
- What is going on down there...
- I hear it too.

142
00:10:53,099 --> 00:10:54,444
Coming from up ahead.

143
00:10:57,997 --> 00:11:00,534
<i>They've sealed the entire building,
no one can get in.</i>

144
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:01,868
<i>We can not get out.</i>

145
00:11:02,289 --> 00:11:06,790
<i>You have to go to the power control room
and turn off the security.</i>

146
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:22,514
You have two more floors to check.

147
00:11:23,418 --> 00:11:26,168
Come on.
We've got two more floors to check.

148
00:11:45,424 --> 00:11:47,640
You take downstairs, I'll go up.

149
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:49,913
We'll meet on the other side.

150
00:12:53,567 --> 00:12:55,017
No lightsaber cuts.

151
00:12:58,295 --> 00:12:59,395
Interesting.

152
00:13:02,938 --> 00:13:04,866
What happened? Where's the droid?

153
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,676
The droid's gone,

154
00:13:06,979 --> 00:13:08,370
but there's good news.

155
00:13:08,776 --> 00:13:11,331
- The Jedi's unarmed.
- What?

156
00:13:12,895 --> 00:13:16,456
It doesn't look like
he has his lightsaber.

157
00:13:16,581 --> 00:13:18,792
Go, bring him back to me.

158
00:13:35,688 --> 00:13:38,685
- The lightsaber, I've got it.
- What?

159
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,946
Why do you have a Jedi's lightsaber?

160
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:47,041
The question is whether we should try
and get it back to Ana...

161
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,566
the Jedi knight.
Or use it ourselves.

162
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:55,083
Everybody quiet.
I've got a call to make.

163
00:13:58,216 --> 00:14:00,255
<i>So here's what you're going to do.</i>

164
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:03,587
<i>First you're going
to make a pardon disc,</i>

165
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:07,306
<i>- you can give it to your friend there.</i>
- Me?

166
00:14:07,685 --> 00:14:10,640
<i>My ship will come and pick him up
and take him to the prison.</i>

167
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,228
<i>Once Ziro has been released
and is handed over to me,</i>

168
00:14:15,418 --> 00:14:18,940
<i>then your associates will be released.
Understand?</i>

169
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,692
Oh, I do.

170
00:14:21,268 --> 00:14:23,241
But I feel it is my duty to warn you

171
00:14:23,366 --> 00:14:25,614
that you will end up
paying for this outrage.

172
00:14:26,288 --> 00:14:27,783
<i>I can live with that.</i>

173
00:14:28,455 --> 00:14:30,105
Come on, open the door.

174
00:14:30,429 --> 00:14:31,779
I won't hurt you.

175
00:14:34,426 --> 00:14:35,878
What have we here?

176
00:14:42,058 --> 00:14:43,058
Blast it!

177
00:14:53,949 --> 00:14:56,899
Tie your little pet up.
We'll bring him to Bane.

178
00:14:59,382 --> 00:15:01,032
Here's the pardon disc.

179
00:15:02,908 --> 00:15:03,908
Lets go.

180
00:15:05,351 --> 00:15:07,813
Why do I have to go
to the jail for this?

181
00:15:07,938 --> 00:15:10,116
- Move it.
- Sorry, Senator.

182
00:15:10,802 --> 00:15:12,977
But everyone has a job to do.

183
00:15:16,863 --> 00:15:17,863
Hurry up.

184
00:15:42,766 --> 00:15:45,039
Young Skywalker.

185
00:15:46,241 --> 00:15:49,677
Not so impressive
without your lightsaber

186
00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:52,266
are you, Jedi?

187
00:15:52,624 --> 00:15:54,641
Toss him in with the others.

188
00:16:06,673 --> 00:16:08,633
3D, are we on schedule?

189
00:16:11,314 --> 00:16:13,380
Arriving at the prison now.

190
00:16:27,197 --> 00:16:28,486
Unlock the doors.

191
00:16:33,484 --> 00:16:36,112
- It's so bright out here!
- Oh, my god.

192
00:16:36,237 --> 00:16:40,106
Why couldn't they do this at night
when it's cooler?

193
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:46,212
Go and get the parting gifts.

194
00:17:01,212 --> 00:17:03,847
Look at Senator Orn Free Taa,

195
00:17:04,076 --> 00:17:06,384
you look so unhappy.

196
00:17:09,999 --> 00:17:14,903
Now get me as far away
from Coruscant as possible!

197
00:17:15,475 --> 00:17:16,368
Now!

198
00:17:17,277 --> 00:17:18,965
<i>Well, Mr Chancellor,</i>

199
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:22,816
<i>thanks to your calm leadership,
the crisis is passed.</i>

200
00:17:23,581 --> 00:17:24,909
<i>I got what I want</i>

201
00:17:25,034 --> 00:17:28,792
<i>so I'll return your Senate
and your senators.</i>

202
00:17:29,223 --> 00:17:30,382
<i>Enjoy them,</i>

203
00:17:30,703 --> 00:17:33,885
<i>but don't try anything
until the sun has set.</i>

204
00:17:34,743 --> 00:17:35,720
<i>Understand?</i>

205
00:17:38,801 --> 00:17:41,685
We are to rendezvous
back at the Senate building.

206
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:43,119
What?!

207
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:49,219
The Outer Rim, not the Senate,
you stupid machine!

208
00:17:54,939 --> 00:17:56,649
We need to get
to the landing platform,

209
00:17:56,774 --> 00:17:58,839
- is everything ready?
- Yep.

210
00:17:59,189 --> 00:18:00,589
Turn on the field.

211
00:18:00,714 --> 00:18:03,730
If you so much as breath
on one of these lasers

212
00:18:03,855 --> 00:18:05,667
the whole room will blow up.

213
00:18:06,156 --> 00:18:07,847
Senators, Jedi,

214
00:18:08,215 --> 00:18:11,644
I bid you all
the most respectful farewell.

215
00:18:12,203 --> 00:18:13,203
Lets go.

216
00:18:28,611 --> 00:18:29,611
All clear!

217
00:18:31,712 --> 00:18:34,802
- Sir, are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

218
00:18:35,295 --> 00:18:38,345
Mission accomplished, sir.
The Chancellor is safe.

219
00:18:38,858 --> 00:18:40,424
Well done, trooper.

220
00:18:50,026 --> 00:18:54,030
<i>You were foolish to think you could
get away with this, bounty hunter?</i>

221
00:18:54,403 --> 00:18:56,760
<i>Now lay down your arms
and come quietly.</i>

222
00:18:57,218 --> 00:18:58,658
No, Chancellor.

223
00:18:58,965 --> 00:19:02,160
I am afraid it is you
who have been foolish

224
00:19:02,285 --> 00:19:04,142
with your senators' lives.

225
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,140
<i>One false move</i>

226
00:19:06,265 --> 00:19:09,731
<i>and the east wing of the Senate building
goes up in smoke.</i>

227
00:19:12,459 --> 00:19:14,569
Please, Ani, wake up.

228
00:19:15,069 --> 00:19:16,988
You win, bounty hunter.

229
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,359
Holster!

230
00:19:23,178 --> 00:19:24,228
Stand down.

231
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:34,047
What are you looking so sad about?

232
00:19:39,715 --> 00:19:42,472
The bounty hunter said
we should just sit here.

233
00:19:42,859 --> 00:19:44,959
I think we should just sit here.

234
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:47,060
That's not a very good idea.

235
00:19:56,477 --> 00:19:57,477
Come on.

236
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:03,368
Let's get going.

237
00:20:06,323 --> 00:20:08,122
Too bad I don't have my lightsaber.

238
00:20:09,151 --> 00:20:10,351
You mean this?

239
00:20:10,581 --> 00:20:12,210
I found it where you dropped it.

240
00:20:18,363 --> 00:20:20,513
Quickly, we don't have much time.

241
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,348
Well, Hutt,

242
00:20:26,093 --> 00:20:31,027
it doesn't look like prison
had to adverse an effect on you.

243
00:20:32,306 --> 00:20:37,191
You can't imagine
the unspeakable things I've suffered!

244
00:20:37,927 --> 00:20:39,614
The horror!

245
00:20:40,213 --> 00:20:43,116
I doubt I'll ever really recover!

246
00:20:43,567 --> 00:20:46,035
How about some dead senators
as pay back?

247
00:21:01,762 --> 00:21:04,429
Another daring rescue, Master Jedi.

248
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:07,603
I do my best, Senator.

249
00:21:09,248 --> 00:21:13,892
Congratulations on a job well done,

250
00:21:14,017 --> 00:21:15,497
bounty hunter.

251
00:21:16,076 --> 00:21:18,526
Time to pay up, Hutt.

252
00:21:18,651 --> 00:21:21,237
I don't work for free.
