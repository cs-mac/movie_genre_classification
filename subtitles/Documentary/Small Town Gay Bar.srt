<i>South Core Police Department.</i>

29
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:46,500
Yes, is
Officer Spencer in?

30
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,002
<i>Who's calling?</i>
Mike Kendall.

31
00:02:48,127 --> 00:02:50,004
<i>Hey, Mike.</i>
I'm checking to see

32
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:51,672
if he's received
my application.

33
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:52,840
It's a PIQ
for re-entry.

34
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:54,717
<i>I know this isn't
what you want to hear,</i>

35
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:55,759
<i>but clearing
your background</i>

36
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:56,886
<i>is gonna be
a real challenge.</i>

37
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:59,513
<i>The department
does not let officers
walk right back in</i>

38
00:02:59,597 --> 00:03:00,723
<i>after something
like this.</i>

39
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:02,057
I see.

40
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:04,143
Would you be able
to give me any idea
how it looks?

41
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:05,519
<i>The board makes
the final decision,</i>

42
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:06,687
<i>but it's not good.</i>

43
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:07,771
Okay.
So they'll call me?

44
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,356
<i>Yeah, Mike,
if they're interested.</i>

45
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,233
Right,
if they're interested.
<i>Look, it'll take</i>

46
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,194
<i>a miracle to get you
back on here.</i>

47
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:14,528
<i>I just wanna be honest.</i>

48
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:15,404
Okay. Thank you.

49
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:18,282
<i>Okay.</i>
Goodbye.

50
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:19,825
Shit.

51
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:50,814
- Fuck you, Kendall.
- Morning.

52
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:54,985
Tell me
about yourself.

53
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:56,278
Okay.

54
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,905
What would you like
to know?

55
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,073
You can start
with why you think

56
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:03,619
you're the best person
for the job.

57
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:04,662
Well...

58
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:07,456
I don't take any shit.

59
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,083
People
that work out here

60
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,918
usually have a way
with animals.

61
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,753
I can imagine.

62
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,213
Hey, buddy.

63
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:15,339
Ooh, whoa, whoa.

64
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,758
If you were to rate
your life success

65
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,468
on a scale
of one to ten,

66
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:20,844
what would it be?

67
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:21,845
Two.

68
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:24,431
Police officer, huh?
Yes, sir.

69
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:28,394
Is there a reason
you're still not
a cop?

70
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,312
Yeah.

71
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:33,148
I think I'd like
to hire you.

72
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:34,316
Really?

73
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,442
I can't say why,

74
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:37,528
but you struck me.

75
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:38,445
Let's get you
signed in.

76
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:42,449
You can start first thing
tomorrow morning.

77
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:45,619
There's, uh,
one other thing

78
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:46,996
I'd like to mention.

79
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:50,624
Sure, go ahead.
Well,

80
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:55,254
I have a problem
with alcohol.

81
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,299
I see.

82
00:04:58,382 --> 00:05:00,634
Most mornings,
I'm about as worthless

83
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:02,344
as a park bench
in hell.

84
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,471
I usually don't start
thinking straight

85
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:05,973
until I get a couple
cold ones in me.

86
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:09,560
After that, I wouldn't
recommend me operating

87
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,478
any heavy machinery,

88
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,564
if you get where I'm going.

89
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,816
Yeah.

90
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,151
But other than that,

91
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:20,029
you know,
I'm ready to go.

92
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,907
Hey, Wendy.

93
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,326
Mister Kendall,

94
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:27,119
how'd the job hunt
go this month?

95
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,245
Pretty good.

96
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:31,415
Pretty good.

97
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,000
I like my chances.

98
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:38,505
Get the fuck out of here.

99
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:41,675
That wasn't
my fault, man.

100
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,428
That asshole's wife
started the whole thing.

101
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,638
Come on.
Easy, boys.

102
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:51,518
Hey,

103
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:54,688
I just had this son
of a bitch dry cleaned.

104
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:58,359
All right, let me
have another beer

105
00:05:58,484 --> 00:06:00,611
and I'll sober up
a little bit.

106
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,112
Yeah, try it, Mike.

107
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,240
I'll have you
hooked up to that
line pole

108
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:06,408
waiting for the cops.

109
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:07,284
You bastard.

110
00:06:07,368 --> 00:06:08,535
I've been coming here
all my life.

111
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:10,371
Yeah, and you're
a nasty son of a bitch.

112
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:11,205
Nobody wants you around.

113
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,582
Teddy likes me.
Yeah, you're right
about that.

114
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,293
Hold on,
my dick is out,

115
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:17,544
my dick is out.

116
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:18,212
Just hold it.

117
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:20,214
Nothing wrong
with my prostate.

118
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:21,090
Hey.

119
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:22,966
That's a paying customer,
gentlemen.

120
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:23,884
Have a little respect.

121
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:26,595
Boys,
get the hell
out of here.

122
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,389
Bunch of pricks.
You okay?

123
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:29,807
I'm fine.

124
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,225
Let's go
to the Dead Dog.

125
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,768
We still got
another hour.

126
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:33,936
Uh-uh, mm-mm,

127
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,062
won't go back there.

128
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:37,940
Not since that pervert
attacked me in
the bathroom.

129
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,734
We ran that guy off.

130
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:44,071
I'm gonna tap out, buddy.

131
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:47,449
Told Kelly that I
would take it easy.

132
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:48,409
You serious?

133
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:50,452
Why don't you ride
with me, man?

134
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:51,829
Just take the couch.

135
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,288
Shit.

136
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:54,581
Gonna have to pass.

137
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:57,334
Last thing I want
is to wake up
at 6:00 AM

138
00:06:57,418 --> 00:07:01,130
to watch <i>SpongeBob</i>
with your kids.

139
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:02,464
Okay.

140
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,633
Hey,

141
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,093
you wrap your car
around a tree,

142
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:08,095
I'm not gonna
feel guilty.

143
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,431
Neither am I.

Come on, Mike.
I'm fine.

I am a good cop.

159
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,223
Turn off your engine.

160
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:34,932
Stay in the car.

161
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,266
I can do the job.
Hey.

162
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,436
You step one foot
outside this vehicle,

Kendall,
I really like you,
but...

165
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:55,869
Jesus Christ.

166
00:08:57,663 --> 00:08:59,456
<i>Come on out, buddy.</i>

167
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,043
Shit.

168
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:33,073
Officer down,
code three.

169
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,117
I repeat,
officer down,

170
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:37,327
code three.

171
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,473
Ooh, boy.

172
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:15,175
<i>♪ She's ♪</i>

173
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:22,724
<i>♪ She's ♪</i>

174
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:57,194
Mike.

175
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,528
Scott.

176
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:01,114
Pete.

177
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:04,284
Mind if we do
this outside?

178
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:12,375
Appreciate you
hanging around.

179
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:13,210
I know the process.

180
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,128
Figured I'd save you
some time.

181
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:16,213
You look
like shit.

182
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,298
I missed my shower
this morning.

183
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:18,840
Hmm.

184
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,468
You've been drinking.

185
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:22,677
Do you even have
a license?

186
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:24,304
Work permit.
Got it on you?

187
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:26,264
Do I really have to deal
with this shit right now?

188
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:28,308
For all we know,
you hit that girl
with your car.

189
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:29,643
You wanna look
at my wheels, Pete?

190
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,853
They're right
over there.
Why don't you wait
it out in the car?

191
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:33,396
I'm all right.
I know.

192
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,698
Lot of the guys
are still pretty
ticked off

193
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:45,826
with how it went down
with Burke.

194
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:48,578
Think I'm happy
about it?

195
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:52,207
All right,
let's talk about
this girl you found.

196
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,917
I need you to start
from the beginning.

197
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,669
Don't leave one
damn thing out.

198
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,838
Think she'll make it?

199
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:01,007
I've seen them
come back from worse.

200
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:13,311
Is she local?

201
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:14,980
Could be.

202
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:16,648
How old is she?

203
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:19,234
Early 20s,
I guess.

204
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,069
Cops have any idea?

205
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,529
They were asking me.

206
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:23,530
Really?

207
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:26,408
You know,

208
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:29,744
this could end up
really nice for you.

209
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,496
You know,
damsel in distress

210
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,416
and here
comes her knight
in shining armor.

211
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,585
You don't get involved
with a victim, Teddy.

212
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,669
That's policy.
Stop.

213
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:41,840
It's policy.
Stop with
the cop talk.

214
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:46,303
You don't have to worry
about that anymore.

215
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:27,427
What is that,
blood in there?

216
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,887
Yeah.

217
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:32,307
That shit's gonna be extra.

218
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:35,727
Oh, man.

219
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,271
Good thing you don't
have any interior.

220
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:40,774
- I appreciate it.
- Thanks.

221
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:44,110
Found this,
underneath the seat.

222
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:54,329
<i>Southside Medical.</i>

223
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,455
Yeah, ICU, please.

224
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:56,623
<i>Please hold.</i>

225
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:57,999
<i>ICU, this is Tammy.</i>

226
00:15:58,124 --> 00:15:59,250
Hello, this
is Mike Kendall.

227
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:01,503
I brought in a girl
yesterday morning.

228
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:02,337
Jane Doe, early 20s,

229
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:03,463
she was banged up
pretty good.

230
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:04,839
<i>Oh, yeah.
Hi, Mr. Kendall.</i>

231
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:06,466
I've got some
of her belongings

232
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,635
and I'd like
to drop them by,

233
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,011
personally,

234
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:10,762
to her.

235
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:12,472
<i>Sorry, guess
no one told you.</i>

236
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:15,475
<i>She--last night
she passed away.</i>

237
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:24,109
<i>Mr. Kendall,
are you still there?</i>

238
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:26,695
No, I'm still here.

239
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,154
Sorry to hear that.

240
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:29,906
<i>Yeah.</i>

241
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:32,867
Was her body identified?

242
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:34,202
<i>I'm sorry,
I can't tell you that.</i>

243
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:35,662
<i>You'd have to contact
the police.</i>

244
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,872
I understand.

245
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:39,708
All right.
<i>All right,</i>

246
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,167
<i>well, you take care.</i>

247
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:43,420
I will.
Thank you.

248
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:37,348
Pretty sure
that's gonna kill it.

249
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:39,934
Tina, why don't
you have a seat?

250
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,686
I'm working, Mike.

251
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:42,437
Come on, please?

252
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,981
It's been a shit day.

253
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:47,776
Fine.

254
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:50,028
Two minutes.

255
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:52,739
It's good
to see you.

256
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:53,948
Yeah.

257
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:56,201
Been a while.

258
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:59,245
You look great.

259
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,581
What are you
doing tonight?

260
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:02,957
You're looking at it.

261
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,877
You wanna stop by
after work?

262
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,754
Have a sleepover?

263
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:11,174
Guess it has been
a while.

264
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:14,594
Me and, uh,

265
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:15,470
Greg.

266
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:18,681
Greg?
Yeah.

267
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:20,600
Are you serious?

268
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,435
Yeah.
Since when?

269
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:23,561
About a month.

270
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:25,271
I thought we had
something going.

271
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:27,774
Mike, I haven't seen you
around in six months.

272
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,317
I've been real busy.

273
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,277
Yeah, well, I called,
left messages.

274
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:33,988
Don't try and tell me you
didn't get them either.

275
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:36,116
That's why I came by.

276
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:38,159
That's a bunch of crap.

277
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:39,744
I wanna make it
right.

278
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:41,830
Have Greg pour us
a couple drinks.

279
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,498
We can talk it over.

280
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,168
What?

281
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:50,964
Sometimes you're just
such a shit heel,
you know?

282
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:53,633
Want me to get you
the check?

283
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:54,968
Keep it open.

284
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:57,137
All right.

285
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:32,297
<i>Girl,</i>

286
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,883
<i>where you at?</i>

287
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:36,134
<i>Kristy?</i>

288
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:37,802
I'm not sure
of your relation,

289
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:40,555
but I wanna let
you know--
<i>Who the fuck
is this?</i>

290
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,016
Put Kristy
on the phone.

291
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,684
I don't think
you understand.

292
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,394
Put my bitch
on the phone.

293
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,687
You know something?

294
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,023
I don't like the shit
that's pouring

295
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:51,399
out of your mouth.

296
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:54,652
Do you know
who the fuck
you talking to?

297
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:56,863
I bet you think that
tired ass Motown
you're playing

298
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:59,449
makes you seem
old school.

299
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:02,702
I'm-a give you that,
funny man.

300
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:05,330
And I'm-a slash
your motherfucking throat.

301
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:06,623
<i>How you like that?</i>

302
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:07,999
Yeah, I doubt it.

303
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,250
Don't think
I can't reach out

304
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,044
and touch you,
motherfucker.

305
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:12,420
Try it.

306
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:15,423
I got to him,

307
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:16,758
rattled his cage.

308
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:18,384
He said
her name
was Kristy.

309
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,053
Mmm,
you got a name.

310
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:21,346
That's good.

311
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:23,056
So that's him?

312
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:25,058
The killer is
on that phone?

313
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,477
I don't think
he knows she's dead.

314
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,604
It's probably a pimp,
could be her boyfriend.

315
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,481
Depends on how
screwed up
this girl was.

316
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:32,857
Wait, you brought
a pimp into our house?

317
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:34,651
No, babe--
It's a phone, Kel.

318
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:35,902
With my babies
in the next room.

319
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:37,278
I didn't invite
the guy to dinner.

320
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:38,738
You shouldn't
be fiddling around

321
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:39,864
with some
dead girl's phone.

322
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:41,199
This guy is key
to the investigation.

323
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:42,617
He knows the girl.
He might even know

324
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,577
who she was
with that night.
You need to give it
to the cops.

325
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:46,120
Uh-hmm.
Of course

326
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:48,248
I'm gonna give it
to the police.

327
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:49,249
Okay, look, Mike.

328
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:51,000
I think what Kelly
is trying to say

329
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:52,460
is that you are
no longer a cop.

330
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:53,628
Don't tell me
what I'm trying
to say.

331
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:55,505
I know I'm not
a damn cop.

332
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:56,798
Thank you
very much, Ted.

333
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:58,841
Okay,
you know what?
I'm going to bed.

334
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,260
Listen.

335
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:02,470
I know you're going
through some shit
right now.

336
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:04,222
And I love you.

337
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:07,225
But it's been
17 months.
Here we go.

338
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:07,934
You're 45.

339
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:10,395
You don't have
a job.
This has nothing
to do with me

340
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:12,689
finding a job.
And no matter
what happens,

341
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,607
nobody's gonna hand you
another badge.

342
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:17,151
So you need to move on,
find something else.

343
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:19,487
You don't know
what you're talking about.

344
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:22,115
I know growing up
for you wasn't easy.

345
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,408
You didn't get
to be a kid.

346
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:24,534
And I sympathize.

347
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,828
Baby, I really do.
I'm not 12 years
old anymore.

348
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:28,496
I don't need people
to look after me.

349
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,707
Okay, where is
the endpoint
here, Mike?

350
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,292
When are you gonna start
taking responsibility

351
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:33,918
for what
you're doing?
Is it possible

352
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:36,629
for one supportive statement
to come out of your mouth?

353
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:38,089
Not when we've been
paying your mortgage

354
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:39,132
for the past
two months, no.

355
00:21:39,257 --> 00:21:40,466
I'm out of here.
Oh,

356
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,926
but don't forget
your beer.

357
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,636
Yeah.

358
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,096
Oh, that's nice.

359
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,140
Nice.
Thanks for
the pep talk, sis.

360
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:48,349
Uh-huh.

361
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,314
- Teddy?
- Yeah?

362
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,607
I need the mop.

363
00:21:56,691 --> 00:21:58,568
All over my damn
clean floor.

364
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,826
Why'd you answer it?

365
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:08,870
Thought it might
be a family member.

366
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:10,621
Come on, Mike,
you know better
than that.

367
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:12,623
I got
her first name.
That's great.

368
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:13,875
We already have that.

369
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:14,959
Family came
in yesterday.

370
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:16,294
IDed the body.

371
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:17,378
What's the family name?

372
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:19,547
Mike...

373
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:22,508
I wanna send flowers.

374
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:24,719
Nevil.

375
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,181
How'd it go
with the parents?

376
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:29,932
They're fine.
They seem upset?

377
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:32,810
Sure.
They have
any idea
who did it?

378
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:35,605
Thanks for the phone,
Mike.

379
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:36,689
I got
the coffee.
Oh,

380
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:38,399
there's still 15-20
numbers in there.

381
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:40,360
Plus the bar stamp
on the back of her hand.

382
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:41,778
You went
through the phone?
We start

383
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:43,821
with the most recent,
work our way back.

384
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:44,989
We can find this prick
who called

385
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:46,866
and twist his arm
up his ass.

386
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:47,950
Ten to one he knows

387
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:49,327
who she was
out with that night.

388
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,787
This is a police
investigation.

389
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,830
I doubt we really
have to get physical.

390
00:22:52,914 --> 00:22:54,832
He's probably
all mouth anyhow.

391
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:56,376
There is no we.

392
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:57,335
You know that.

393
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:59,337
Yeah, sure.

394
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,130
Just got
the old juices flowing.

395
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:02,340
I know you found her.

396
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:04,550
I know
you feel responsible.
But you're not in this.

397
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:05,927
In any way.

398
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:09,180
Okay.

399
00:23:09,931 --> 00:23:12,517
Got it?
Yeah.

400
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:20,566
Kristy Nevil
was a child of light,

401
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:22,693
a wonderful,
charming girl.

402
00:23:22,777 --> 00:23:25,571
And although
we haven't had
the pleasure of Kristy

403
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,615
here during
the last few years,

404
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:31,661
I choose
to remember her
as the inquisitive,

405
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,329
God-fearing young lady

406
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:37,291
I received during
her first communion.

407
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:39,919
Departures are
always difficult.

408
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:08,239
How can I help you?
I need about 15--

409
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:09,407
you know what?

410
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:13,453
Let's make it
25 business cards.

411
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,930
Hi. Jack Winter.

412
00:24:33,014 --> 00:24:35,349
I called earlier.

413
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,228
That thing leak oil?

414
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:51,532
I'm here because I knew
Kristy several years ago.

415
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,659
She and my younger
brother were friends.

416
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:56,162
They went
to Mt. Conyer
High together.

417
00:24:56,287 --> 00:24:57,538
How old are you?

418
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:58,789
Winter...

419
00:24:58,873 --> 00:24:59,874
I don't--

420
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:02,877
I don't remember
your brother.

421
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:04,712
He's a lot younger.

422
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,172
Their relationship
was brief.

423
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:07,715
She only came around
a few times

424
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,925
before they
grew apart,

425
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:11,469
but I was quite
fond of Kristy.

426
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:12,929
What was
his first name?

427
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:14,013
Kelly.

428
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:15,806
Kelly.

429
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:18,851
But everyone
called him Bill.

430
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:20,144
Billy.

431
00:25:20,228 --> 00:25:21,521
Willy.

432
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:24,565
I think I remember
something about
a Will.

433
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:25,691
Exactly.

434
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:27,652
He could leave
an impression.

435
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:29,111
What can we do for you,
Mr. Winter?

436
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:31,405
I'd like to find out
who killed your daughter.

437
00:25:31,531 --> 00:25:33,241
We've already talked
to the police.

438
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:34,408
I'm not police,

439
00:25:34,492 --> 00:25:36,160
I'm a private investigator.

440
00:25:36,244 --> 00:25:39,914
Police have a tendency
to miss certain details.

441
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,082
Important details.

442
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:44,544
And those are the types
of details

443
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:45,878
that I pick up.

444
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:47,964
We don't wanna hire
a private investigator.

445
00:25:48,089 --> 00:25:51,259
Which is why I've decided
to take the case pro bono,

446
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:52,969
Kristy being
a friend and all.

447
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,095
The least I could do.

448
00:25:54,262 --> 00:25:57,473
I have to be honest
with you, Mr. Winter,

449
00:25:57,557 --> 00:26:01,561
Kristen was
a very--

450
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,649
she was a very
mixed-up girl.

451
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,985
She was
a free spirit, Deborah.

452
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,111
I'll give you that.

453
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:12,488
She took
this family to hell

454
00:26:12,572 --> 00:26:15,908
more times
than I can count.

455
00:26:16,576 --> 00:26:18,619
So maybe we would
just like for her

456
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:21,414
to find
some peace.

00:26:48,858 --> 00:26:50,818
Haven't seen you
in a while, Mike.

465
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:52,820
I haven't been in

466
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:54,280
attacked Teddy
in the bathroom.

467
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:56,198
We ran that guy off.

468

That's what I heard.

How about a beer?

472
00:27:02,747 --> 00:27:05,124

478
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:16,636
You should talk to her.

479
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:18,596

Who's a tough guy now?

484
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:33,486
Shit.

485
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,282
Take a seat, Mike.

486
00:27:39,742 --> 00:27:41,327
What are you
doing here?

487
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:43,287
Having a beer,
meeting a friend.

488
00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:44,330
What are you boys
doing here?

489
00:27:44,455 --> 00:27:45,748
None of your
Goddamned business.

490
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:46,874
Who are
you meeting?

491
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,751
What?
Who's your friend?

492
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:53,339
Ah, hot little blonde
over there.

493
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,091
You know her?
Heidi?

494
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:57,051
Yeah.
It's a new thing.

495
00:27:58,052 --> 00:28:00,805
She seems like
a real catch.

496
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:02,682
She's a wizard
with a pool stick.

497
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:07,478
Uh, that guy gives her
lessons all the time.

498
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:08,688
He's great.

499
00:28:10,064 --> 00:28:12,650
She's a hooker,
dipshit.

500
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:15,069
Why don't you
call it a night, Mike?

501
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:15,986
Yeah.

502
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,947
Before you get
someone else shot.

503
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:27,540
Hey, you wanna grab
something to eat?

504
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:29,750
I don't think so.

505
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:31,794
Can we do
this again?

506
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:33,003
Sure.

507
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:37,007
How about I call
you tomorrow?

508
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:38,718
Fine.

509
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:42,513
Who's that, your wife?

510
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:44,056
That's my sister.

511
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:47,309
Like a sister-sister
or that's your sister?

512
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:48,936
I was adopted.

513
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:51,272
How'd that work?

514
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:52,815
Compared to starving
and getting the shit

515
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:55,025
getting kicked out of me
by a couple of junkies,

516
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:58,320
I thought it
was pretty great.

517
00:28:58,404 --> 00:29:00,781
Want a beer?

518
00:29:01,449 --> 00:29:02,867
Yeah.

519

00:29:17,465 --> 00:29:19,800
to the trunk
of his car?

528
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:23,637
We got
some identifiers
here, Jonathan.

529
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:25,181
Yeah,
those are Mike's shots.

530
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:28,392
All right,
let's get it open.

- Oh, shit.
- Jesus.

532
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:32,772
Mike shot her.

533
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,234
You know,
he's fucking drunk,
right?

534
00:29:37,318 --> 00:29:39,069
Yeah.

535
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:40,821
Point-13.

536
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,198
Shit's not right,
I'm doing it again.

537
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:46,160
It's been calibrated--
I said
I'm doing it again.

538
00:30:12,937 --> 00:30:15,314
Jack Winter.

539
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:21,529
Thank you,
Mr. Winter,

540
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:24,240
for being so...

541
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:25,241
expeditious.

542
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,785
Yeah. I had to shuffle
a few appointments,

543
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:30,955
but this
is important to me.

544
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:33,874
My granddaughter's
been dead a week.

545
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:37,753
Police are no longer
answering my phone calls.

546
00:30:37,837 --> 00:30:39,421
And some son of a bitch

547
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:41,465
is getting away
with murder.

548
00:30:41,549 --> 00:30:42,758
You know,
to them,

549
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:44,885
she is just
another toe tag.

550
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,304
I want this guy.

551
00:30:47,388 --> 00:30:50,140
I wanna chain him
to the back of
my Bentley

552
00:30:50,224 --> 00:30:54,144
and I wanna drag him
around a little.

553
00:30:54,228 --> 00:30:57,064
I can understand that,
Mr. Yandell.

554
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:59,066
Can you do it, Jack?

555
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:01,819
Can you find
this guy for me?

556
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:03,028
I can.

557
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:09,159
My daughter
informs me

558
00:31:09,243 --> 00:31:12,037
that you are willing
to take this case

559
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:13,247
for free.

560
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:15,124
That's correct.

561
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:16,709
Not a chance.

562
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:17,626
What's your rate?

563
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,128
You know,
it varies.

564
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:21,005
You know,
travel expenses,

565
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,172
food, you never
really know

566
00:31:22,256 --> 00:31:25,301
with this kind of--
Twenty-five hundred
a week?

567
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:27,428
That'll work.

568
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:31,807
Oh, would you mind
making it out to cash?

569
00:31:31,891 --> 00:31:35,895
Ex-wife's got me
by the balls.

570
00:31:41,275 --> 00:31:43,944
How much do you
know about Kristy?

571
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:46,071
Well,

572
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:47,364
she was a handful.

573
00:31:47,448 --> 00:31:49,617
Did you know
she was a drug addict

574
00:31:49,742 --> 00:31:52,286
and a prostitute?
Something like that.

575
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:54,663
Everybody tried
to help her, of course.

576
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:58,500
But, uh,
she'd push
people away.

577
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:01,462
She was raised strict,

578
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:03,964
probably the reason
for her rebellion.

579
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,758
You ever meet
any of her friends?

580
00:32:05,883 --> 00:32:08,636
She hung out
with some real
scumbags.

581
00:32:08,761 --> 00:32:10,471
Anybody you could put
a name to?

582
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:12,139
If I could put a name
to someone, Jack,

583
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:15,517
I would be busting
down doors.

584
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:17,853
She, uh, come by
with a couple

585
00:32:17,937 --> 00:32:19,063
of skank girlfriends

586
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:23,108
looking for
a little handout.

587
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:25,694
Guy who drove 'em,

588
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:27,279
wiry little shit,

589
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:30,658
Hispanic, I guess.

590
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:33,786
Uh, you think you
could pick him out?

591
00:32:33,911 --> 00:32:36,163
No, I don't think so.

592
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:38,666
I won't forget
his car, though.

593
00:32:38,749 --> 00:32:39,917
Impala.

594
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:41,418
New?

595
00:32:41,502 --> 00:32:44,546
'60s, purple.

596
00:32:47,341 --> 00:32:50,344
All right, racers,
are you ready?

597
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:52,221
Yeah.
On your mark,

598
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:54,473
get set, go.

599
00:32:57,017 --> 00:32:59,561
Let's go.

600
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:10,406
Sir, is that
an open container?

601
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:11,532
Ha, ha.
It will be.

602
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:14,660
Hey, Mike,
where you been
hiding yourself, man?

603
00:33:14,785 --> 00:33:17,037
Oh, I've been busy.
I got a job.

604
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:19,873
A job?
What kind of job?

605
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:21,750
Uh, sort of
an assistant type deal.

606
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:23,168
Uh, I run errands,
do fact checking.

607
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:25,379
Things like that.
Mike, that's great.

608
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,296
That's great, man.

609
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,506
Uh, it's
a temporary position.

610
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:29,717
You know what?
Let's get Kels up here.

611
00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:31,176
Hmm. Well, I don't--
I don't wanna...

612
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:32,720
No, no.
Hey, babe,
come here.

613
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:33,595
Your brother's here.

614
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:34,847
Look, she looks busy
with the egg toss.

615
00:33:34,972 --> 00:33:36,515
Don't...
Okay. Look,
look here, man.

616
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,599
She really wants
to talk to you.

617
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:39,018
She feels bad
about the other night.

618
00:33:39,143 --> 00:33:40,019
All right?
Just hear her out.

619
00:33:40,144 --> 00:33:43,522
What do you want,
Mike?
All right. Babe,

620
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:45,691
Mike got a job.

621
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:46,984
Nothing big.

622
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:48,569
Yeah.
He's some assistant

623
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:49,695
to some
big shot downtown.

624
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,906
Hmm, back to work.
That's, that's good, huh?

625
00:33:53,032 --> 00:33:53,866
I wanted
to give you this.

626
00:33:53,991 --> 00:33:55,409
Oh, yeah, he's
probably gonna have

627
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:58,412
his own desk by the end
of the week, huh, Mike?
Hm?

628
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:00,789
This is $500.

629
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:02,374
It's a start.

630
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:06,795
Wow.

631
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:07,921
Thank you, Mike.

632
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:10,674
You're welcome.

633
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:12,885
Well, I'm glad I got
to stop by.

634
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:14,553
I'll just add this
to the pile.

635
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:16,764
I have to hit
the road.
But wait,
wait, you,

636
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:18,265
you just got here, man.
At least stay

637
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,309
for the three-legged race.
Hey, you could buddy up

638
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:22,561
with JJ.
Uh, no, I can't.

639
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:24,480
Uh, I got--
I got a date.

640
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:26,899
A date?

641
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:28,025
That's incredible.

642
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:30,569
- Is it that incredible, really?
- Hmm,

643
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:34,198
I'm just saying, man.
I mean, this is like
a total windfall.

644
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:36,617
Hmm.
Anybody we know?

645
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:38,118
Hmm?

646
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:39,787
I don't think so.

647
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:46,585
I made you
some cereal.

648
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,253
Thanks.

649
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:58,639
What do you think?

650
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:00,808
It's good.

651
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:03,393
It's an off brand.

652
00:35:03,477 --> 00:35:05,646
Yeah. There's a shit ton
of raisins.

653
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:08,607
That's what
I'm saying.

654
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:14,488
You know a lot
of the other girls?

655
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:20,244
I can, if that's
what you're into.

656
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,247
I picked up
a girl last week.
Kristy.

657
00:35:23,831 --> 00:35:24,873
You know her?

658
00:35:24,957 --> 00:35:27,960
Girls change their name,
like, every other week.

659
00:35:28,085 --> 00:35:29,795
Short brunette,
real pretty?

660
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,423
Lot of girls fit
that description.

661
00:35:33,507 --> 00:35:35,384
She hangs out
with a Hispanic guy,

662
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,302
drives an Impala.

663
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:39,221
Hmm, it's not
ringing a bell.

664
00:35:40,556 --> 00:35:42,391
I mean,
girls come and go.
It's not something people

665
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:44,518
usually stick to.

666
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:45,936
Right.

667
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:49,022
But I can ask around.

668
00:35:49,148 --> 00:35:51,817
That would be great.

669
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:54,862
Oh, shit.

670
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:56,488
I got a 10:30 across town.

671
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:58,323
Think you could drop me?

672
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:00,284
Oh.

673
00:36:07,249 --> 00:36:10,002
Call me, baby.

674
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:39,364
Pull around the corner.

675
00:36:54,755 --> 00:36:56,006
Do you have
brain damage?

676
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:58,926
Are you following me?
I'm following the girl.

677
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:00,636
But imagine my surprise
when a black Nova

678
00:37:00,761 --> 00:37:02,054
picked her up
for the evening.

679
00:37:02,179 --> 00:37:03,305
Not exactly
what you think.

680
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:05,641
Screwing a hooker.
I'm gaining
her trust.

681
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:07,643
You're compromising
my fucking investigation,
Mike.

682
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:10,479
I'm working
on a lead.
And I told you
to lay off.

683
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:11,772
She's gonna ask around.

684
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:12,898
She's not gonna ask shit.

685
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:15,108
Think she wants to get
in the middle of this?

686
00:37:15,234 --> 00:37:17,277
They were
best friends.

687
00:37:17,361 --> 00:37:19,488
She said that?
Hell, yes.

688
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:20,822
Then I'll bring her in.

689
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:22,407
You bring her in,
she's gonna clam up.

690
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:23,951
She's doesn't want
that kind of attention.

691
00:37:24,076 --> 00:37:25,827
Why do you think
she's working with me?

692
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:28,247
Give her some room.
If she comes up
with something--

693
00:37:28,372 --> 00:37:30,332
If she comes up
with something,
you bring it to me.

694
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,125
Of course.

695
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:35,003
I'm the first person
you call.
Right.

696
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:36,630
What did I say?
You're the first.

697
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:39,258
You don't check out the lead.
You don't get a bite to eat.

698
00:37:39,383 --> 00:37:41,301
You don't wipe your ass.
You call me.

699
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:44,763
Is that clear?
Absolutely.

700
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:49,101
You get one shot
at this, Mike.

701
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:00,696
What?

702
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:03,573
Rose, you ain't got
a damn thing to eat
in here.

703
00:38:03,657 --> 00:38:05,867
I just went shopping.

704
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:08,203
Yeah.
Well, that'd be great
if I was in the mood

705
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:09,788
for celery sticks
and a Fruitini.

706
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:11,123
- That's what I eat.
- Yeah.

707
00:38:11,248 --> 00:38:12,249
We need to get
some protein up

708
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:15,419
in this bitch.
I'm about to pass out.

709
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:20,632
And how long I got to watch
all these desperate-ass
bitches

710
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:21,842
trying to get up
on this dude?

711
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:24,594
Sam never complains
when I watch my shows,

712
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,721
and he brings pizza.

713
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,681
Well, guess what?
Sweetie has
a night off.

714
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:30,642
So, do me a favor
and change this shit
to SportsCenter.

715
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,106
Hey, you got somebody
coming over?

716
00:38:45,574 --> 00:38:47,326
Who is it?

717
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:02,090
You girls
were just too
fucking greedy.

718
00:39:09,598 --> 00:39:11,350
Jack Winter here.

719
00:39:11,475 --> 00:39:14,895
This young woman
was a friend of Kristy's.

720
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,646
Are you sure?
Positive.

721
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:20,859
She offered to blow me
on three separate
occasions.

722
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:22,611
For money,
of course.

723
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:26,323
This prick,
I don't know
who he is.

724
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:29,201
I do.

725
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:47,302
You all right?

726
00:39:47,928 --> 00:39:49,846
Just waking up, Steve.

727
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:57,646
Mike?

728
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,899
Morning, Mike.
Beer?

729
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:03,026
You hear
the news, Randy?
What?

730
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,820
The news,
you know,

731
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:06,363
things that
are happening.

732
00:40:07,531 --> 00:40:09,241
I don't recall.
Yeah.
Seems you ought

733
00:40:09,366 --> 00:40:12,202
to remember
if you heard
something or not.

734
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:19,543
Didn't know.

735
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:23,171
An employee of yours

736
00:40:23,255 --> 00:40:26,883
had a little accident
last night.

737
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:29,886
He worked the floor.

738
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:34,015
So what?

739
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:38,520
She was working
something else.

740
00:40:40,856 --> 00:40:42,899
In the back.

741
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:53,618
All right.

742
00:40:53,702 --> 00:40:55,662
You think
you know
something?

743
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:58,039
You got two patrons
and one employee
dead.

744
00:40:58,123 --> 00:41:00,250
And Kristy Nevil
had your bar stamp

745
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:02,294
on the back
of her hand.

746
00:41:02,419 --> 00:41:03,712
Have a drink, Mike.

747
00:41:03,837 --> 00:41:05,589
How long
before the whole
damn police force

748
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:07,215
is breathing
down your neck?

749
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:08,633
You are the cop.

750
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:09,968
You tell me.

751
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:12,304
They already know
you're running a brothel.

752
00:41:12,429 --> 00:41:13,597
It's a bar.

753
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,140
I can't do
a background check

754
00:41:15,265 --> 00:41:18,435
on everybody that walks
through that door.

755
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:20,896
You solicited me,
Randy.

756
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:23,106
Which tells me
you're taking
a cut.

757
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,399
You can't prove that.

758
00:41:24,483 --> 00:41:25,942
I don't have to.

759
00:41:26,026 --> 00:41:27,777
Cops are gonna do
it for me.

760
00:41:27,861 --> 00:41:28,987
They just want
a fall guy

761
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:31,156
and will take
the first one
that pops up.

762
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:33,575
All I have to do
is set it in motion.

763
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:34,826
What do you want?

764
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:36,953
The guy who
supplies the girls.

765
00:41:37,037 --> 00:41:38,955
The one that drives
the Impala.

766
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:40,081
Can't help you.

767
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:41,666
How about
a number?

768
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,126
We didn't exchange
info.

769
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:45,879
The less we know
about each other,
the better.

770
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:47,506
If he wants
to say something,

771
00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:49,841
he'll come by.
The guy's paranoid.

772
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:51,510
What if you have to get
a hold of him?

773
00:41:51,635 --> 00:41:53,845
I use the girls.

774
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,305
Look...

775
00:41:56,348 --> 00:41:58,475
All I have
is a name.

776
00:41:58,558 --> 00:42:01,853
It's not something
you put on a driver's
license.

777
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:04,022
But it's what everyone
calls him.

778
00:42:04,147 --> 00:42:07,859
It's what he
calls himself.

779
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:09,861
Mood.

780
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:39,766
Come on, man.

781
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:43,520
Hey.

782
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:45,355
Over here.

783
00:42:46,398 --> 00:42:50,235
That's right.

784
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:52,112
Right over here.

785
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:02,372
Say Motown.

786
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:03,873
What?

787
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:08,837
Say tired ass Motown.

788
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,089
I ain't gonna ask you again.

789
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:14,009
I'm-a just pull the trigger.

790
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:17,596
Tired ass Motown.

791
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:22,851
I told you I was
gonna find your
ass, funny man.

792
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:25,395
I've been looking
for you.

793
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:26,521
Oh, yeah?
Funny.

794
00:43:26,605 --> 00:43:29,524
A lot of fools'
been looking
for Mood these days.

795
00:43:29,608 --> 00:43:30,775
Yeah, fuck him
up, Mood.

796
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,403
Baby, you take your ass
in that kitchen right now.

797
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:36,281
Can't you see
I'm conversating
with this motherfucker?

798
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:39,409
And what'd I tell you about
getting up in my grill, huh?

799
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:47,042
You messed up,
Mike Kendall.

800
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:50,378
Asking about Kristy
like you did.

801
00:43:50,462 --> 00:43:51,463
We had
a good time once.

802
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:53,256
Nah, nah, nah,
stop it.

803
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:57,135
Kristy ain't gonna give
a John her real name.

804
00:43:57,218 --> 00:43:58,553
That's rule number one.

805
00:43:58,637 --> 00:44:00,305
So you can drop
all that bullshit.

806
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:01,931
I ain't trying to hear it.

807
00:44:02,015 --> 00:44:05,226
Now, I'm down two bitches

808
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:09,230
and I'm in hot pursuit
for a third prostitute.

809
00:44:09,314 --> 00:44:10,899
And Baby over there,

810
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:15,320
she seems to think
that you're the triggerman.

811
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:19,240
But I've been kicking it
with you for a minute.

812
00:44:19,324 --> 00:44:22,577
I'm gonna say
that you ain't.

813
00:44:22,661 --> 00:44:26,331
That's a cold-blooded
professional.

814
00:44:26,456 --> 00:44:29,000
And you ain't nothing
but a...

815
00:44:29,084 --> 00:44:32,212
a drunk
in a $50 suit.

816
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:34,172
I'm a private investigator.

817
00:44:34,297 --> 00:44:37,801
I'm working
for the grandfather.

818
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:44,849
Now you starting
to make some sense.

819
00:44:44,933 --> 00:44:47,185
So y'all figured
you'd come to me?

820
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:49,020
I'm the key
to some answers.

821
00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:52,190
Well, I'm gonna tell you,
I ain't got shit.

822
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:54,359
You're missing
a third girl?

823
00:44:54,484 --> 00:44:56,111
That ain't my girl.

824
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:58,488
But I'm looking for her.

825
00:44:58,571 --> 00:45:01,366
That crazy ass bitch
got spooked,

826
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:03,535
climbed up a coon's ass,

827
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:06,788
pulled her tail all the way
in with her.

828
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:08,498
When?

829
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:09,999
Last night,

830
00:45:10,083 --> 00:45:11,710
after Rose got smoked.

831
00:45:11,835 --> 00:45:13,712
They knew each other.

832
00:45:14,671 --> 00:45:16,297
She was friends
with my girls.

833
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:18,800
Braiding each other's hair
and whatnot.

834
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:20,218
There a place she'd go?

835
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:21,219
Oh, for sure.

836
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:24,639
You check it out?

837
00:45:24,723 --> 00:45:26,558
We don't go

838
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:29,477
knocking on no doors
for no bitches.

839
00:45:29,561 --> 00:45:31,980
As you can imagine,

840
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:33,565
most families...

841
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:35,358
ain't too enthusiastic

842
00:45:35,442 --> 00:45:38,820
about seeing Mood
knocking on their door.

843
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:40,363
Feel me?

844
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:42,240
I feel you.

845
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:04,596
Hello.

846
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:07,098
I'm Jack Winter.
I'm a private investigator.

847
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:10,894
I'd like to speak
with Ms. Oarblocker.

848
00:46:14,856 --> 00:46:17,233
Is this the Oarblocker
residence?

849
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:19,569
Can I see
some identification?

850
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:21,446
Oliver!

851
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:24,282
Let the man in,
for God's sakes.

852
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:27,076
Ms. Oarblocker,
I'm Jack Winter,
private investigator.

853
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:29,746
I'd like to talk with you
about your granddaughter.

854
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:31,915
Let me see this.

855
00:46:31,998 --> 00:46:34,125
Oh.

856
00:46:34,209 --> 00:46:35,627
Okay, come on in.

857
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:39,005
Don't mind him.
He's just overly
protective.

858
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:43,343
Come on in.

859
00:46:43,426 --> 00:46:45,887
It's right down here
around the corner.

860
00:46:51,935 --> 00:46:53,978
This is her room.

861
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:03,279
And she was living
here recently?

862
00:47:03,363 --> 00:47:05,406
It's the only home
she has,

863
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:07,408
as far as I know.

864
00:47:07,492 --> 00:47:09,661
I didn't realize someone
thought that she
was missing

865
00:47:09,786 --> 00:47:12,580
until the officers
came by this
morning.

866
00:47:12,664 --> 00:47:15,208
The police
were here?
Two of them.

867
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:17,752
And I told them
just give her
a couple of days,

868
00:47:17,836 --> 00:47:18,962
you know,
she'll turn up.

869
00:47:19,045 --> 00:47:21,214
She's always in
and out.

870
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:25,677
She's a very
independent girl.

871
00:47:26,386 --> 00:47:28,638
Uh, if it's all right
with you, I'd, uh,

872
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:30,807
like to have
a look around.

873
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:32,684
Oh, fine.

874
00:47:32,809 --> 00:47:36,646
Fine.
The officers wanted
to look around, too.

875
00:47:36,729 --> 00:47:40,358
Can I offer you a drink,
Mr. Winter?

876
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:41,860
I got juice boxes.

877
00:47:41,943 --> 00:47:42,986
No, thank you.

878
00:47:43,069 --> 00:47:46,197
Ah. Milk or tea?

879
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:48,533
Or maybe the juice.

880
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:49,701
Okay. Perfect.

881
00:47:49,826 --> 00:47:52,370
Perfect.

882
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:08,947
Thank you.

883
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:11,032
How'd you get
a hold of him?

884
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:12,700
Uh, he found me.

885
00:49:12,784 --> 00:49:14,035
Yeah, I can see that.

886
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:14,786
You know,
there's easier ways

887
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:17,413
of getting yourself killed.

888
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:24,295
How'd you guys find out
about Ivy Oarblocker?

889
00:49:24,379 --> 00:49:25,630
Who's Ivy Oarblocker?

890
00:49:25,755 --> 00:49:26,798
The missing girl.

891
00:49:26,923 --> 00:49:28,800
What missing girl?

892
00:49:28,925 --> 00:49:30,885
The one
who was friends
with the dead hookers.

893
00:49:30,969 --> 00:49:31,970
You didn't send
two officers

894
00:49:32,095 --> 00:49:34,472
to her grandmother's house
this morning?

895
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:36,808
Nope, not us.

896
00:49:36,933 --> 00:49:39,644
Are you sure?
Oarblocker.

897
00:49:39,727 --> 00:49:40,728
Ivy Oarblocker.

898
00:49:40,812 --> 00:49:42,772
If it got something to do
with the case,

899
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:43,940
then I'd know about it.

900
00:49:44,065 --> 00:49:45,692
Give me
your notepad.

901
00:49:45,817 --> 00:49:49,278
Why?
I'm giving you
the address.

902
00:49:49,362 --> 00:49:50,989
Girl's been missing
a couple of days.

903
00:49:51,072 --> 00:49:52,782
Grandma said
two officers stopped

904
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:54,117
by the house
this morning.

905
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,744
Could be
a different department.

906
00:49:56,828 --> 00:49:57,662
Maybe.

907
00:49:57,745 --> 00:49:58,830
You don't think so?

908
00:49:58,913 --> 00:50:00,665
I don't know.

909
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:02,583
You think
these are our guys?

910
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:03,626
Possible.

911
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:05,003
Hey, where you going?

912
00:50:05,086 --> 00:50:07,505
Was that
all I need to know?
For right now.

913
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:10,008
Hey, you get
something else--
You're the first
person I call.

914
00:51:08,274 --> 00:51:10,234
Amateur hour.

915
00:51:36,469 --> 00:51:38,304
Shit.

916
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:49,732
Who is it?

917
00:51:49,816 --> 00:51:52,944
<i>Sir, we're with the City
Planning Commission.</i>

918
00:51:53,069 --> 00:51:55,488
Okay.
<i>We'd like
to talk to you</i>

919
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:57,949
<i>about a major
development coming
to your neighborhood.</i>

920
00:51:58,074 --> 00:51:59,117
<i>Oh, that
sounds great,</i>

921
00:51:59,242 --> 00:52:01,702
but I'm not feeling
too hot right now.

922
00:52:01,786 --> 00:52:02,995
Can we do this
another time?

923
00:52:03,079 --> 00:52:04,664
<i>It'd be best
if we talked now.</i>

924
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:06,707
<i>Don't know
when we'll be back, sir.</i>

925
00:52:06,833 --> 00:52:08,417
<i>It will only take
a minute.</i>

926
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:12,421
<i>Sir? Sir?</i>

927
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:31,941
Son of a bitch,
he's out the back.

928
00:52:34,152 --> 00:52:35,319
We'll track him down.

929
00:52:47,206 --> 00:52:48,624
Rode the bike.

930
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:50,668
Ah, Nova's
on the fritz.

931
00:52:50,793 --> 00:52:51,794
Where's Kelly?

932
00:52:51,878 --> 00:52:53,838
Oh, she took the kids
to a show.

933
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:55,339
Something with
some singing carrots.

934
00:52:55,464 --> 00:52:57,258
Hell, I couldn't stomach it.

935
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:59,260
What's up
with your head?
At work,

936
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:01,971
low hanging shelf,
had a lot in my hands.

937
00:53:02,054 --> 00:53:03,389
Look.

938
00:53:03,472 --> 00:53:04,515
What's this?

939
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:05,641
I want the Glock.

940
00:53:07,059 --> 00:53:08,186
What?
My gun.

941
00:53:08,311 --> 00:53:09,854
The one I sold you.
I wanna buy it back.

942
00:53:09,937 --> 00:53:11,689
That's the 250.
Yeah, you gave me

943
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:13,274
specific instructions
about the gun.

944
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:16,152
I was to hold on to it.
I was never to sell it
to you

945
00:53:16,235 --> 00:53:18,779
or anybody else until you
were back on the force.

946
00:53:18,863 --> 00:53:20,531
You made that very clear.

947
00:53:20,656 --> 00:53:22,074
I know.

948
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:25,661
Are you back
on the force?

949
00:53:25,745 --> 00:53:28,623
I got an interview.

950
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:32,877
Hot damn,
okay, come on.

951
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,003
<i>Hello?</i>

952
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:35,713
This thing
just went next level.

953
00:53:35,796 --> 00:53:37,548
How would you like us
to proceed?

954
00:53:37,632 --> 00:53:39,550
<i>Okay,
we need you
to finish it.</i>

955
00:53:39,634 --> 00:53:41,510
<i>We're not going to jail
for this shit.</i>

956
00:53:41,594 --> 00:53:43,804
<i>I'm not losing my family.</i>

957
00:53:43,888 --> 00:53:46,515
<i>Understand?</i>

958
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:49,310
It's gonna cost you
double.

959
00:53:49,393 --> 00:53:51,062
<i>Just get it done.</i>

960
00:53:51,145 --> 00:53:53,231
We'll be in touch.

961
00:53:58,277 --> 00:54:00,571
When the department sees
my targets, they're gonna shit.

962
00:54:00,655 --> 00:54:02,990
Okay, look, you can't
let Kelly know, all right?

963
00:54:03,074 --> 00:54:05,243
Interview or not,
she will not understand.

964
00:54:05,368 --> 00:54:06,244
No way.
All right?

965
00:54:06,369 --> 00:54:07,828
Where you headed?
Across town.

966
00:54:07,912 --> 00:54:09,080
Hey, man,
I can drop you off.

967
00:54:09,205 --> 00:54:10,248
Nope, I'm done
putting you out.

968
00:54:10,331 --> 00:54:12,667
Be by tomorrow
to pick up my wheels.

969
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:13,501
Okay.

970
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:22,260
Oh, look who's back.

971
00:54:22,343 --> 00:54:24,512
Deja vu.
You wanna piss me off?

972
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:26,597
Keep acting
like I'm one
of your drunks.

973
00:54:26,681 --> 00:54:28,975
Not long ago
you were.

974
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:30,768
Got to say,

975
00:54:30,893 --> 00:54:32,353
I liked you more then.

976
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:33,854
You had Julian
watching Rose.

977
00:54:33,938 --> 00:54:36,399
Probably told him he could
make some easy cash

978
00:54:36,482 --> 00:54:38,025
hanging out
with a beautiful girl.

979
00:54:38,109 --> 00:54:39,610
Can't blame him.

980
00:54:39,735 --> 00:54:42,613
Hell, I'd have taken
the gig myself.

981
00:54:45,533 --> 00:54:47,535
Where's Ivy?

982
00:54:51,706 --> 00:54:55,876
I don't know
what you're talking about.

983
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,461
Sam, show Mike
to the door.

984
00:54:57,545 --> 00:55:02,091
Sam, you touch me,
and I'm gonna rip
your fucking balls off.

985
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:06,637
I remember back
in high school,

986
00:55:06,762 --> 00:55:09,265
I watched you
pitch a no-hitter
in the city championship.

987
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:11,142
Hell, you took us
all the way to state.

988
00:55:12,184 --> 00:55:14,145
My dad said you
could have made pro

989
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:16,272
if you'd set
your mind to it.

990
00:55:16,355 --> 00:55:18,649
You were
a real technician.

991
00:55:18,774 --> 00:55:21,944
Not to mention a 90-mile
per hour fast ball

992
00:55:22,028 --> 00:55:24,238
made you
one hell of a player.

993
00:55:24,322 --> 00:55:25,823
A real bear,

994
00:55:25,948 --> 00:55:28,492
they used to say.

995
00:55:30,953 --> 00:55:33,581
Where is she?

996
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:40,296
I know
you think
she's safe,

997
00:55:40,379 --> 00:55:41,839
but it won't last.

998
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:43,466
Not with these guys.

999
00:55:43,549 --> 00:55:46,010
Just as sure as I did,
they'll track her down,

1000
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:49,263
and they'll go through you
to do it.

1001
00:55:53,351 --> 00:55:54,852
Leslie.

1002
00:55:56,103 --> 00:55:57,938
You got the bar.
Okay.

1003
00:55:58,022 --> 00:56:00,358
- I got her at Fred's.
- Who's Fred?

1004
00:56:00,441 --> 00:56:01,692
One of my cooks.

1005
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:11,535
Hey.

1006
00:56:11,619 --> 00:56:13,412
What can I help
you with?

1007
00:56:13,496 --> 00:56:14,872
Is Kelly Kendall in?

1008
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:16,749
Banks,
Kelly Banks.

1009
00:56:16,832 --> 00:56:18,709
Yeah, she's been that
for eight years now.

1010
00:56:18,834 --> 00:56:20,461
Brother's Mike Kendall?

1011
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:23,297
Yeah, yeah,
but she's not in
at the moment.

1012
00:56:23,381 --> 00:56:25,424
What--what's this about?

1013
00:56:25,508 --> 00:56:26,842
We're actually here
about her brother Mike.

1014
00:56:26,926 --> 00:56:28,886
She's listed
as a secondary
point of contact.

1015
00:56:29,011 --> 00:56:31,972
Oh, is that bad?

1016
00:56:32,056 --> 00:56:33,516
Well, not
for Mr. Kendall, no.

1017
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:36,185
Uh, you see,
we'd like to lease

1018
00:56:36,268 --> 00:56:37,853
a nominal part
of his land

1019
00:56:37,937 --> 00:56:38,896
and he has
the opportunity

1020
00:56:39,021 --> 00:56:40,481
to make a significant amount
of money.

1021
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:42,900
Okay.
So it's best

1022
00:56:42,983 --> 00:56:46,028
that we talk to him
as soon as possible.

1023
00:56:46,112 --> 00:56:47,363
Uh, yeah, well,
you just missed him.

1024
00:56:47,446 --> 00:56:48,948
He took off
in a cab.

1025
00:56:49,031 --> 00:56:50,741
He did?
Yeah.

1026
00:56:50,825 --> 00:56:53,244
Any idea where
he was headed?

1027
00:56:54,078 --> 00:56:54,745
No.

1028
00:56:54,829 --> 00:56:56,539
No, he didn't say.

1029
00:56:57,623 --> 00:57:00,167
But if you got
a business card,
I'll take it from you

1030
00:57:00,251 --> 00:57:02,753
and, uh, I'll pass it
along to him.

1031
00:57:02,837 --> 00:57:04,588
I got one of those.

1032
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:17,268
Mr. Randy.

1033
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:18,227
<i>¿Y éste?</i>

1034
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:19,353
It's okay, Conchita.

1035
00:57:19,437 --> 00:57:21,063
<i>Es mi amigo.</i>

1036
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:23,858
<i>¿Dónde está Ivy?</i>

1037
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:25,651
<i>Acá. Vamos.</i>

1038
00:57:37,496 --> 00:57:39,498
Miss Ivy,
it's Mr. Randy.

1039
00:57:39,623 --> 00:57:41,792
Why don't you
hang back a bit.

1040
00:57:41,917 --> 00:57:43,461
Let me warm her up.

1041
00:57:46,547 --> 00:57:48,257
Hey.

1042
00:57:48,382 --> 00:57:50,301
- Hey, baby.
- I, uh,

1043
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:51,802
I brought somebody.

1044
00:57:51,927 --> 00:57:53,429
His name is Mike.

1045
00:57:53,512 --> 00:57:55,764
I've known him
a good long time.

1046
00:57:55,848 --> 00:57:57,016
He used to be
a cop.

1047
00:57:57,808 --> 00:57:59,477
Just trying to help her out,
huh, Randy?

1048
00:57:59,602 --> 00:58:01,437
I thought you weren't
gonna tell nobody?

1049
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:04,940
Yeah, I think I'm
starting to understand why.

1050
00:58:05,024 --> 00:58:07,985
Randy, this isn't
what we talked about.

1051
00:58:08,068 --> 00:58:10,196
You got a plan,
sweetie?

1052
00:58:10,321 --> 00:58:13,157
Something tells me
I'm looking at it.

1053
00:58:13,282 --> 00:58:14,533
Think you can
wait them out?

1054
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:17,453
Maybe they'll get tired
of looking?

1055
00:58:17,536 --> 00:58:21,081
Let's say
they can't find you.

1056
00:58:21,916 --> 00:58:24,126
Doesn't mean it's over.

1057
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:26,879
They'll grab somebody else,
someone close.

1058
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:29,048
Let's say
your grandmother.

1059
00:58:29,173 --> 00:58:32,635
Well, it won't matter
if she doesn't know
the answers

1060
00:58:32,718 --> 00:58:34,303
to the questions
that they're asking.

1061
00:58:34,386 --> 00:58:35,429
They'll make
her suffer.

1062
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:37,598
And when
her body is found,
beaten and mutilated,

1063
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:39,391
and floating
in the St. John's River,

1064
00:58:39,517 --> 00:58:40,851
you'll wish
you'd come forward.

1065
00:58:40,976 --> 00:58:43,395
By then, they'll have
someone else.

1066
00:58:43,521 --> 00:58:46,023
Maybe another relative,

1067
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:48,692
or a friend.

1068
00:58:48,776 --> 00:58:50,528
Maybe Randy.

1069
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:55,449
That is if there's still
somebody you give
a shit

1070
00:58:55,616 --> 00:58:57,701
about besides yourself.

1071
00:58:57,785 --> 00:58:59,995
Let's cut the bullshit.

1072
00:59:03,082 --> 00:59:05,793
You tell me
what's going on.

1073
00:59:29,733 --> 00:59:31,527
What can I get you?

1074
00:59:33,737 --> 00:59:36,865
We're looking
for Mike Kendall.

1075
00:59:36,949 --> 00:59:39,201
No, he's not here.

1076
00:59:39,285 --> 00:59:40,744
But he was here.

1077
00:59:40,869 --> 00:59:42,538
I didn't say that.

1078
00:59:42,621 --> 00:59:43,747
So he wasn't here?

1079
00:59:43,831 --> 00:59:44,915
I haven't seen him.

1080
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,750
Well, that's strange.

1081
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:49,753
Because I just spoke
with a cab driver

1082
00:59:49,837 --> 00:59:52,423
who said no less
than a half hour ago,

1083
00:59:52,548 --> 00:59:55,551
he dropped Mike Kendall
off at this bar

1084
00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:58,262
and watched him
walk inside.

1085
00:59:58,345 --> 01:00:00,598
Huh.

1086
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:02,975
That just kind of proves
to me that you're lying.

1087
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:06,270
I could haul your ass
in right now, just
for that.

1088
01:00:06,395 --> 01:00:08,981
- What do you think?
- Cheese sticks?

1089
01:00:09,106 --> 01:00:10,232
End of the bar,
thanks, Fred.

1090
01:00:10,316 --> 01:00:13,444
Why don't you just
hold tight there,
Pablo?

1091
01:00:15,696 --> 01:00:17,406
Being a bartender,

1092
01:00:17,489 --> 01:00:20,200
you see a lot of shit.

1093
01:00:20,409 --> 01:00:21,910
You learn a lot of shit, too.

1094
01:00:21,994 --> 01:00:24,788
Useless knowledge
most of the time,

1095
01:00:24,872 --> 01:00:29,543
but once in a while,
you get a gem.

1096
01:00:30,127 --> 01:00:33,130
Let me give you
an example.

1097
01:00:34,506 --> 01:00:36,467
I bet you don't know

1098
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:38,510
that our law
enforcement holds

1099
01:00:38,636 --> 01:00:40,804
a lot of pride

1100
01:00:40,888 --> 01:00:42,640
in the national bird.

1101
01:00:42,723 --> 01:00:44,850
Now that
makes sense,

1102
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:48,145
if you consider
that the state's fowl

1103
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:49,480
is the valley quail.

1104
01:00:49,605 --> 01:00:51,690
Let me tell you,
there's nothing
tough about a quail,

1105
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:54,276
and you sure as hell
wouldn't want to put that

1106
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:56,236
on your uniform.

1107
01:00:58,072 --> 01:01:00,032
Now, you see,

1108
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:01,909
at the top
of your badge,

1109
01:01:01,992 --> 01:01:05,079
there's supposed
to be an eagle.

1110
01:01:05,537 --> 01:01:09,166
A bald eagle,
the national bird.

1111
01:01:10,501 --> 01:01:13,212
Now, what you
got there

1112
01:01:13,337 --> 01:01:15,381
looks more
like a hawk,

1113
01:01:15,506 --> 01:01:18,717
which is
a hell of a bird,

1114
01:01:18,842 --> 01:01:20,511
but it ain't
no bald eagle.

1115
01:01:22,137 --> 01:01:24,807
So, I'm guessing that
that badge was made
in, uh, Tijuana

1116
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:27,393
by a counterfeiter
who didn't know
the difference

1117
01:01:27,518 --> 01:01:30,771
between a chicken
and chicken shit.

1118
01:01:38,737 --> 01:01:41,031
Is that right?

1119
01:01:42,533 --> 01:01:44,368
It could be.

1120
01:01:58,632 --> 01:02:02,720
Look, these guys are
a bunch of rich assholes.

1121
01:02:02,803 --> 01:02:04,555
They were in town
for some real estate thing

1122
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:06,098
and they wanted
to get their dicks wet.

1123
01:02:07,015 --> 01:02:08,726
They wanted
some young pussy,

1124
01:02:08,809 --> 01:02:13,272
and they
were willing to pay
a lot of money for it.

1125
01:02:15,023 --> 01:02:15,899
So, you
blackmailed them

1126
01:02:16,024 --> 01:02:17,609
and now they paid
a couple of psychopaths

1127
01:02:17,735 --> 01:02:20,154
to knock off the girls.
Real smart.

1128
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:21,989
I helped them
with the blackmail,

1129
01:02:22,072 --> 01:02:23,949
but the girls came to me
with the video.

1130
01:02:24,074 --> 01:02:24,742
They wanted to do it.

1131
01:02:24,867 --> 01:02:26,744
Maybe we hit them up
for more too many times

1132
01:02:26,869 --> 01:02:31,165
but who kills people
over a few hundred
thousand dollars?

1133
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:32,958
How old are you?

1134
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:35,753
How old do you
want me to be?

1135
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:37,296
You teach her to say that?

1136
01:02:37,379 --> 01:02:39,256
God, no, he didn't
tell me shit.

1137
01:02:39,381 --> 01:02:42,593
But you saw
the opportunity,
didn't you, Randy?

1138
01:02:42,676 --> 01:02:44,887
Hey,
I've fucked guys
for money before.

1139
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:47,222
Pack up your stuff,
we're going to the police.

1140
01:02:47,306 --> 01:02:49,433
Wait a minute, Mike.
We can't go
to no cops.

1141
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:51,351
We can pay you.

1142
01:02:51,435 --> 01:02:53,061
We got money.
We already got
a hundred

1143
01:02:53,145 --> 01:02:54,855
and forty thousand
out of these guys,

1144
01:02:54,938 --> 01:02:56,064
and that was
just our cut.

1145
01:02:56,148 --> 01:02:59,151
I'm bringing
you both in.

1146
01:02:59,610 --> 01:03:01,737
I don't think
I can let you
do that.

1147
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:04,782
I'm not asking.

1148
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:08,118
What are you gonna do?
Shoot me?

1149
01:03:12,748 --> 01:03:15,167
Maybe.

1150
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:21,256
That's for being
a scumbag.

1151
01:03:23,008 --> 01:03:24,968
Ivy, get your stuff.

1152
01:03:25,093 --> 01:03:29,389
- Come on.
- Jesus fucking Christ.

1153
01:03:35,103 --> 01:03:37,481
Abby, Abby, Abby,
get your backpack.

1154
01:03:37,606 --> 01:03:38,982
And JJ, close
the door after her.

1155
01:03:39,107 --> 01:03:41,360
Yes, ma'am.
Come on.

1156
01:03:43,445 --> 01:03:44,738
Okay.

1157
01:03:44,822 --> 01:03:46,740
Come on in.

1158
01:03:46,824 --> 01:03:49,201
Yeah, well--hey,
what do you want
for dinner?

1159
01:04:01,171 --> 01:04:03,715
Looks like poor Leslie
just got the one shot off.

1160
01:04:03,841 --> 01:04:04,758
Well, this guy
was a bouncer.

1161
01:04:04,842 --> 01:04:07,845
Looks like that poor lady
was just having a drink.

1162
01:04:07,928 --> 01:04:10,389
Sir?

1163
01:04:10,639 --> 01:04:12,307
I got
a witness.

1164
01:04:12,391 --> 01:04:13,392
Said there were
three of them.

1165
01:04:13,517 --> 01:04:15,769
They lit out of here
in a silver '90s
model sedan.

1166
01:04:17,437 --> 01:04:18,689
My nose is broken.

1167
01:04:18,814 --> 01:04:22,025
Be happy
you're still breathing.

1168
01:04:24,278 --> 01:04:25,863
What?

1169
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:28,365
That car.

1170
01:04:28,448 --> 01:04:29,575
Yeah?

1171
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,493
It's them.

1172
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:40,627
Okay, get rid
of that Mexican.

1173
01:04:40,711 --> 01:04:43,213
Open the door.

1174
01:04:43,338 --> 01:04:44,882
<i>Abre la puerta.</i>

1175
01:04:45,007 --> 01:04:46,758
You open the door,

1176
01:04:46,884 --> 01:04:49,928
or I shoot you
in the fucking head.

1177
01:04:51,597 --> 01:04:53,056
He understood that one,
didn't he?

1178
01:04:59,104 --> 01:05:00,105
Holy shit.

1179
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:01,982
Go, go.

1180
01:05:04,359 --> 01:05:06,612
Get down.

1181
01:05:10,741 --> 01:05:12,242
Damn.

1182
01:05:14,578 --> 01:05:16,413
Bitch! Hold tight.

1183
01:05:24,838 --> 01:05:26,798
Oh, shit.

1184
01:05:29,635 --> 01:05:30,427
You're bleeding, baby.

1185
01:05:30,552 --> 01:05:33,347
Fuck.

1186
01:05:37,017 --> 01:05:38,644
Hang on.

1187
01:05:48,362 --> 01:05:49,696
Fuck!

1188
01:05:59,164 --> 01:06:01,083
You can get out there.

1189
01:06:04,628 --> 01:06:05,629
You okay?

1190
01:06:05,712 --> 01:06:07,965
You see my leg
pissing blood?

1191
01:06:08,048 --> 01:06:10,008
No, I'm not okay.

1192
01:06:11,802 --> 01:06:12,844
Ease off.
We're clear.

1193
01:06:15,055 --> 01:06:17,140
Take your foot
off the gas.

1194
01:06:17,516 --> 01:06:19,101
There you go,
nice and easy.

1195
01:06:19,226 --> 01:06:20,644
Give it the brakes.

1196
01:06:26,858 --> 01:06:28,860
Ivy, look at me.

1197
01:06:30,195 --> 01:06:31,279
Look at me.

1198
01:06:31,363 --> 01:06:32,280
Look at me.

1199
01:06:32,364 --> 01:06:34,157
You're safe.

1200
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:38,036
You did great.

1201
01:06:38,161 --> 01:06:40,122
We're safe.

1202
01:06:40,205 --> 01:06:42,124
Calling the cops.
It's over.

1203
01:06:46,253 --> 01:06:47,629
Teddy?

1204
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:51,633
Not even close, Mike.

1205
01:06:52,718 --> 01:06:54,553
That was a pretty
good shot.

1206
01:06:54,678 --> 01:06:56,346
Where's Teddy?

1207
01:06:56,430 --> 01:06:57,848
Teddy?

1208
01:06:57,973 --> 01:07:00,684
I'm looking at him
right now.

1209
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:03,979
Don't you touch him.

1210
01:07:04,187 --> 01:07:06,148
Gonna cut a deal
with you, Mike.

1211
01:07:06,231 --> 01:07:07,315
Don't you
fucking touch him.

1212
01:07:07,399 --> 01:07:10,485
<i>You don't get to make
the demands here, Mike.</i>

1213
01:07:10,569 --> 01:07:12,029
Now, whatever happens

1214
01:07:12,154 --> 01:07:16,700
or doesn't happen
to your friend here,
Teddy,

1215
01:07:16,783 --> 01:07:18,660
that's on you.

1216
01:07:18,994 --> 01:07:20,620
But I got to tell you,

1217
01:07:20,704 --> 01:07:21,913
he's not looking good.

1218
01:07:23,081 --> 01:07:26,168
<i>But if I don't get
that girl,</i>

1219
01:07:26,251 --> 01:07:27,711
<i>I'm gonna kill him.</i>

1220
01:07:27,836 --> 01:07:30,047
<i>And then
I'm gonna kill
your sister, too.</i>

1221
01:07:31,131 --> 01:07:34,134
And I don't care
if it takes a day

1222
01:07:34,217 --> 01:07:35,510
or a lifetime,

1223
01:07:35,594 --> 01:07:37,054
I'm gonna gut
those two fucking kids

1224
01:07:37,179 --> 01:07:39,347
of hers
from stem to stern.

1225
01:07:39,723 --> 01:07:41,767
<i>I'm going to take
your silence</i>

1226
01:07:41,850 --> 01:07:43,226
<i>as a sign
of understanding.</i>

1227
01:07:45,312 --> 01:07:47,064
I'm gonna call you
in a bit.

1228
01:07:47,147 --> 01:07:50,984
I'm gonna give you a time
and a place, huh?

1229
01:07:52,027 --> 01:07:54,196
But you fuck me,

1230
01:07:54,279 --> 01:07:56,406
you get cute,

1231
01:07:56,490 --> 01:07:58,617
you get stupid...

1232
01:07:59,034 --> 01:08:00,827
well, we both know
how that ends.

1233
01:08:03,914 --> 01:08:06,333
Change of plans.

1234
01:08:11,088 --> 01:08:12,839
What?

1235
01:08:12,923 --> 01:08:13,924
<i>Hello?</i>
Kelly,

1236
01:08:14,049 --> 01:08:15,217
I need you
to leave the house.

1237
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:16,843
<i>Why?</i>
I don't have time

1238
01:08:16,927 --> 01:08:18,970
to explain right now.
Take the kids
and get out.

1239
01:08:19,721 --> 01:08:22,349
<i>Meet me
at the Black Bear Diner.</i>

1240
01:08:27,646 --> 01:08:29,064
You got a phone?
Uh-hmm.

1241
01:08:29,147 --> 01:08:30,190
Call us a cab.

1242
01:08:34,402 --> 01:08:35,570
Hey, guys,

1243
01:08:35,654 --> 01:08:38,365
I need to talk
to your mom
for a minute.

1244
01:08:40,909 --> 01:08:42,119
What's going on?

1245
01:08:42,202 --> 01:08:43,286
What did you do?

1246
01:08:43,411 --> 01:08:45,872
And who's that girl, Mike?

1247
01:08:45,956 --> 01:08:47,124
Listen, uh,

1248
01:08:47,249 --> 01:08:49,417
I messed up.

1249
01:08:49,918 --> 01:08:51,753
I got into some shit.

1250
01:08:51,837 --> 01:08:54,464
These are some really
bad guys and they're--

1251
01:08:54,589 --> 01:08:56,800
they got Teddy.
What?

1252
01:08:56,883 --> 01:08:58,844
They have him and, uh,
they're making threats.

1253
01:08:58,927 --> 01:08:59,970
No, Mike.

1254
01:09:00,095 --> 01:09:01,138
I'm gonna do
everything I can...

1255
01:09:01,263 --> 01:09:02,305
Mike...
You and the kids--

1256
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:03,390
No...
I need--
I need you...

1257
01:09:03,473 --> 01:09:06,268
You stupid shit.

1258
01:09:06,351 --> 01:09:08,645
I can fix this.
You can't fix it, Mike.

1259
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:12,232
You can't fix it.
You're the damn problem.

1260
01:09:12,607 --> 01:09:14,151
You need to call
the cops.

1261
01:09:14,276 --> 01:09:17,445
Tell them
you and the kids
need protection.

1262
01:09:17,571 --> 01:09:21,158
You stupid, stupid shit.

1263
01:09:21,241 --> 01:09:22,159
All we do is help you,

1264
01:09:22,242 --> 01:09:25,704
and all you do is
ruin people's lives.

1265
01:09:27,998 --> 01:09:30,292
That's what you do.

1266
01:09:30,792 --> 01:09:32,794
Your car's here.

1267
01:09:34,087 --> 01:09:36,423
I'm gonna get him back.

1268
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:38,508
You better get him back.

1269
01:09:38,633 --> 01:09:40,969
You better bring him back.

1270
01:09:46,183 --> 01:09:48,310
Hey, you Ivy?
Uh, yeah.

1271
01:09:48,393 --> 01:09:49,769
Hop on in.

1272
01:09:49,853 --> 01:09:51,188
How's your day going?

1273
01:09:51,271 --> 01:09:53,607
Pretty good.
Good, where to?

1274
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:56,276
Make a right.
Okay.

1275
01:10:05,285 --> 01:10:07,621
Men like this
don't forget.

1276
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:09,873
They come back
and finish the job.

1277
01:10:09,998 --> 01:10:11,499
There you go,
sweetie.

1278
01:10:11,583 --> 01:10:14,377
I've dealt with people
like this before,

1279
01:10:14,502 --> 01:10:18,548
not in this exact way,
but in business.

1280
01:10:18,632 --> 01:10:19,466
These are sociopaths.

1281
01:10:19,549 --> 01:10:23,511
They don't give a shit
about anybody
but themselves.

1282
01:10:24,930 --> 01:10:26,556
We do this,

1283
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:29,643
there's no halfway.

1284
01:10:30,227 --> 01:10:33,730
Are you sure
you're up for this?

1285
01:10:42,822 --> 01:10:45,033
Hello?

1286
01:10:48,411 --> 01:10:51,081
Yeah, I know the place.

1287
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:57,337
Old train depot off 226.

1288
01:10:58,296 --> 01:10:59,673
Not a lot out there.

1289
01:11:00,423 --> 01:11:03,301
I'm counting on it.

1290
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:06,846
Listen...

1291
01:11:08,431 --> 01:11:10,433
in three hours,
give this guy a call.

1292
01:11:10,558 --> 01:11:13,311
He's a good cop.

1293
01:11:14,229 --> 01:11:17,315
We could use
another man.

1294
01:11:17,691 --> 01:11:18,858
I might know someone.

1295
01:11:18,942 --> 01:11:21,444
Somebody you can trust?

1296
01:11:21,528 --> 01:11:22,362
I think so.

1297
01:11:22,445 --> 01:11:24,698
And he definitely
seems motivated.

1298
01:11:27,409 --> 01:11:30,078
You got to be kidding me.

1299
01:11:30,161 --> 01:11:32,455
Who the hell else
are we gonna get?

1300
01:11:43,091 --> 01:11:45,760
So, y'all got a plan
for this shit,

1301
01:11:45,844 --> 01:11:50,682
or we just gonna jump
into an old-fashioned
dog fight?

1302
01:11:52,809 --> 01:11:53,810
Both.

1303
01:11:53,935 --> 01:11:56,730
<i>♪ I reach out
my hand to you ♪</i>

1304
01:11:56,813 --> 01:11:59,107
<i>♪ But the door is closed
to get you through ♪</i>

1305
01:11:59,190 --> 01:12:02,319
<i>♪ Just you and me,
together we would ♪</i>

1306
01:12:02,402 --> 01:12:05,280
Do we have to listen
to this?

1307
01:12:05,363 --> 01:12:07,157
Hell, yeah.
This shit right here

1308
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:09,492
gets my motherfucking
blood up.

1309
01:12:31,348 --> 01:12:34,017
Where you buy
a car like this?

1310
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:37,479
You don't,
you got to build this.

1311
01:12:38,146 --> 01:12:40,231
Doesn't seem practical.

1312
01:12:41,191 --> 01:12:42,776
Because it ain't.

1313
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:45,612
It's just
my weekend car.

1314
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:11,805
Are you ready?

1315
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:15,642
Is that all you bringing,
that musket?

1316
01:13:15,725 --> 01:13:17,977
It's a high-quality
musket, son.

1317
01:13:19,062 --> 01:13:21,398
It's your bed.

1318
01:13:25,193 --> 01:13:27,237
Frankly,

1319
01:13:27,362 --> 01:13:29,906
I'm surprised
you made it out.

1320
01:13:30,031 --> 01:13:33,910
These motherfuckers
murdered two of my girls.

1321
01:13:34,035 --> 01:13:36,246
You must've taken
quite a loss.

1322
01:13:36,329 --> 01:13:39,582
Oh, you think
this is business, huh?

1323
01:13:39,707 --> 01:13:43,461
I see what you did
to my granddaughter.

1324
01:13:44,337 --> 01:13:47,006
You know, I found her
living on the street,

1325
01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:49,759
rolling tricks
for dime bags.

1326
01:13:50,051 --> 01:13:51,845
I raised her rate,

1327
01:13:51,928 --> 01:13:53,346
gave her a roof.

1328
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:54,639
You wanna get
all mystical

1329
01:13:54,764 --> 01:13:57,058
and start searching
for answers and shit,

1330
01:13:57,142 --> 01:14:01,229
maybe you ought to think
about what y'all did.

1331
01:14:46,774 --> 01:14:49,527
You sure
you can shoot
a fool from this far?

1332
01:14:49,611 --> 01:14:53,364
I can rip the heart
right out of his chest.

1333
01:15:30,026 --> 01:15:32,529
Just stay put.

1334
01:15:57,428 --> 01:15:58,513
You drunk?

1335
01:15:59,347 --> 01:16:01,057
I'm comfortable.

1336
01:16:02,267 --> 01:16:05,061
Looks like you caught
a stitch in your side.

1337
01:16:05,395 --> 01:16:07,855
Looks worse
than it is.

1338
01:16:09,524 --> 01:16:10,608
The girl?

1339
01:16:10,942 --> 01:16:12,318
Teddy first.

1340
01:16:13,278 --> 01:16:15,738
All right,
tough guy.

1341
01:16:15,863 --> 01:16:17,740
I'll show you
mine first.

1342
01:16:19,242 --> 01:16:21,661
Where's your partner?

1343
01:16:22,579 --> 01:16:24,414
Does it matter?

1344
01:16:41,514 --> 01:16:43,600
Oh, he got
the prick.

1345
01:16:49,897 --> 01:16:51,941
There's some shit
right here.

1346
01:16:52,025 --> 01:16:53,234
All right.

1347
01:16:53,318 --> 01:16:56,446
Just so we're all
on the same page,

1348
01:16:56,529 --> 01:16:59,282
Captain Shit Heels here
makes any sudden
moves,

1349
01:17:00,825 --> 01:17:03,870
trigger gets pulled
and off goes
his head.

1350
01:17:04,203 --> 01:17:05,955
The same
goes for me.

1351
01:17:06,456 --> 01:17:10,251
If I'm forced to make
any sudden moves...

1352
01:17:10,335 --> 01:17:12,712
trigger gets pulled

1353
01:17:12,795 --> 01:17:14,297
and off goes
his fucking head.

1354
01:17:15,548 --> 01:17:17,884
I'm sensing
a theme here.

1355
01:17:18,343 --> 01:17:20,053
Mike?

1356
01:17:20,136 --> 01:17:23,097
I'm here, buddy.

1357
01:17:25,350 --> 01:17:26,976
Oh, fuck.

1358
01:17:27,101 --> 01:17:28,645
Take the shot,
come on.

1359
01:17:29,228 --> 01:17:31,564
All right, Mike.

1360
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:34,567
Time for you
to show me yours.

1361
01:17:36,444 --> 01:17:37,528
Sure.

1362
01:17:47,747 --> 01:17:49,165
Let's go, sweetheart.

1363
01:17:49,290 --> 01:17:53,127
Take the shot,
Steve, come on.

1364
01:17:56,839 --> 01:17:57,840
All right.

1365
01:17:57,924 --> 01:17:59,884
Here you go,

1366
01:17:59,967 --> 01:18:02,303
take her.

1367
01:18:10,186 --> 01:18:12,689
This all could
have been so simple.

1368
01:18:12,814 --> 01:18:15,149
Yeah, it didn't
work for me.

1369
01:18:17,443 --> 01:18:18,444
Yeah.

1370
01:18:18,528 --> 01:18:20,697
Mind if I finish
my beer?

1371
01:18:21,197 --> 01:18:22,198
Go right ahead.

1372
01:18:22,573 --> 01:18:24,701
Make the shot, old man,
come on, take the shot.

1373
01:18:27,578 --> 01:18:30,039
Stay down, Teddy.

1374
01:18:30,164 --> 01:18:31,708
Mike!

1375
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,001
Mike!

1376
01:18:34,085 --> 01:18:35,378
Aah!

1377
01:18:36,254 --> 01:18:37,714
Ah! Ah! Ah!

1378
01:18:37,797 --> 01:18:38,923
What the heck?

1379
01:18:39,549 --> 01:18:41,676
Mike!

1380
01:18:48,683 --> 01:18:50,727
Ah!

1381
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:52,520
Stay put, Teddy,
stay down.

1382
01:18:55,398 --> 01:18:57,400
Shit.

1383
01:19:05,158 --> 01:19:06,367
Mike!

1384
01:19:32,769 --> 01:19:34,103
Fuck!

1385
01:20:14,936 --> 01:20:16,771
He wouldn't go down.

1386
01:20:16,854 --> 01:20:20,024
Motherfuckers had
vests on.

1387
01:20:24,153 --> 01:20:24,987
Steve.

1388
01:20:25,071 --> 01:20:26,155
I'm here.

1389
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:29,075
I'm hit.
Son of a bitch.

1390
01:20:37,708 --> 01:20:40,002
Mike.

1391
01:20:41,045 --> 01:20:42,129
I got you, buddy.

1392
01:20:42,213 --> 01:20:45,216
Okay.
I got you.

1393
01:21:43,065 --> 01:21:45,985
Come on.
Somebody help these fools.

1394
01:22:13,930 --> 01:22:15,681
Mike.

1395
01:22:15,973 --> 01:22:20,019
We just spent our morning
in the judge's chambers.

1396
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:22,688
It appears
the court is, uh,

1397
01:22:22,772 --> 01:22:26,025
inclined to rule
in self-defense.

1398
01:22:26,817 --> 01:22:27,860
Really?

1399
01:22:28,277 --> 01:22:30,780
You just lucked out.

1400
01:22:34,241 --> 01:22:36,410
What about the girl?

1401
01:22:37,203 --> 01:22:38,579
Agreed to testify.

1402
01:22:38,663 --> 01:22:39,580
She's in protective custody,

1403
01:22:39,664 --> 01:22:41,707
but she'll end
up in a home
after the trial.

1404
01:22:41,832 --> 01:22:42,917
We'll hope
for the best.

1405
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,252
Right now we've got two
of the three pricks in custody.

1406
01:22:45,336 --> 01:22:46,462
They're partners,
all of them.

1407
01:22:46,587 --> 01:22:48,297
They run a high-end
real estate firm

1408
01:22:48,381 --> 01:22:49,256
in Orange County.

1409
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:51,133
First one came pretty easy.

1410
01:22:53,177 --> 01:22:54,804
Number two gave us
a little chase.

1411
01:22:54,887 --> 01:22:57,264
He's running.
He's running.

1412
01:22:59,892 --> 01:23:02,061
Freeze! Freeze!
On the ground.

1413
01:23:02,144 --> 01:23:03,479
On the ground.
Okay.

1414
01:23:03,604 --> 01:23:05,523
Get down
on the ground.

1415
01:23:08,317 --> 01:23:10,444
Those were
$200 wingtips, man.

1416
01:23:10,528 --> 01:23:12,989
Number three,
William Ritter,
owns a boat,

1417
01:23:13,072 --> 01:23:14,156
sailed himself
into Mexico.

1418
01:23:14,281 --> 01:23:17,368
So, it's
probably gonna take
a dump-truck-size shitload

1419
01:23:17,451 --> 01:23:19,286
of paperwork to get
his ass out of there.

1420
01:23:19,370 --> 01:23:21,622
At least six months
to extradite. And that's...

1421
01:23:21,747 --> 01:23:23,124
only if we can convince
the district attorney

1422
01:23:23,207 --> 01:23:25,001
this guy's even
worth the trouble.

1423
01:23:25,084 --> 01:23:28,421
Worst part is we know
exactly where he's at.

1424
01:23:32,341 --> 01:23:33,843
An old fishing village,

1425
01:23:33,968 --> 01:23:35,678
couple miles south
of Costa Maya.

1426
01:23:36,512 --> 01:23:38,848
We just
thought you might
wanna know that.

1427
01:23:45,938 --> 01:23:47,773
You have
two hours.

1428
01:23:47,857 --> 01:23:49,358
I repeat,
that is two hours

1429
01:23:49,442 --> 01:23:53,654
exactly to complete
this exam.

1430
01:23:54,071 --> 01:23:56,490
It is multiple choice.

1431
01:23:56,782 --> 01:24:00,494
You will begin... now.

1432
01:24:49,126 --> 01:24:52,505
Heard they ruled
that shooting...

1433
01:24:52,588 --> 01:24:54,465
self-defense.

1434
01:24:55,883 --> 01:24:57,593
They did.

1435
01:24:59,261 --> 01:25:01,138
That's good.

1436
01:25:02,681 --> 01:25:04,934
Took the private
investigator's exam

1437
01:25:05,059 --> 01:25:06,060
this morning.

1438
01:25:06,143 --> 01:25:08,270
Seemed like
I knew most of it.

1439
01:25:10,106 --> 01:25:13,859
I think this
is something
I could be good at.

1440
01:25:13,943 --> 01:25:16,195
Even if I am
a fuck-up.

1441
01:25:18,781 --> 01:25:20,741
Yeah.

1442
01:25:20,825 --> 01:25:22,952
Might be.

1443
01:25:31,377 --> 01:25:32,920
How's Kelly?

1444
01:25:37,216 --> 01:25:40,511
It's not gonna
happen right now, Mike.

1445
01:25:48,102 --> 01:25:51,188
Thought maybe
