1
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,879
Education has become

2
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,639
one of the most fiercely debated
political battlegrounds.

3
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:21,739
Billions of pounds of our money
are poured into schools every year.

4
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,079
But there's an aspect of education

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,659
that is rarely questioned,
a slow, creeping change

6
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,459
in the make-up of our schools -
one third are now faith schools.

7
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,079
I did, I converted to Catholicism.

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,159
For the sake of your child.

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,479
For the sake of my child.

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,239
If you come to our school,
we're very much open minds.

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,239
What we are trying to indoctrinate
is a view that faith matters.

12
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,919
Some say parents must be able to
educate their child in their faith.

13
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,419
Do you believe that parents
have the human right

14
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,979
to choose the education
for their children or not?

15
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,539
Others fear this is limiting
and divisive.

16
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,699
To separate yourself off
from the rest of humanity,

17
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,339
is deeply, deeply tragic.

18
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,639
Isn't it time for our society to
re-think what is best for children?

19
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,499
I want to explore the balance of
rights between a parent's right

20
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,259
to educate a child
in their own faith

21
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,339
and the children's rights
to determine their own beliefs

22
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,925
and approach the world
with an genuinely open mind.

23
00:01:21,386 --> 00:01:26,617
FAITH SCHOOL MENACE?

24
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,079
One in three state schools in
our country is now a faith school,

25
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:39,179
a school with formal links
to a religion.

26
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,879
These schools have
extraordinary privileges.

27
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,239
Because, 60 years ago,

28
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,279
churches provided half the money
for their schools,

29
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,839
many were allowed to discriminate
on religious grounds

30
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,159
in selecting pupils
based on parents' faith

31
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,079
and in recruiting staff.

32
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,399
They could also have the freedom
to teach their own syllabus

33
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,279
of religious education, RE.

34
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,079
Today, we taxpayers fund the running
of these schools and also pay

35
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,699
up to 90% of the cost
of building them.

36
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,259
But the problem is
the churches held on

37
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,059
to their special powers
in their schools.

38
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,099
And then the Government
under Tony Blair

39
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,699
made a decision
that changed Britain forever.

40
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,539
It oversaw the foundation of over
100 new faith schools,

41
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,179
including Muslim, Hindu
and Sikh schools,

42
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:33,179
along with 42 academies sponsored
by Christian organisations.

43
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,979
A big man for a big job - Charles
Clarke's waited a long time for this.

44
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,279
This man was Education Secretary
under Blair.

45
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,079
Why did he open the floodgates?

46
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,959
You can say, we're only going
to keep it that you have Christian

47
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,219
and a tiny proportion
of other faith schools.

48
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,419
I think that leads you into
serious risk of discrimination,

49
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,019
saying it's OK to have
a Christian faith school

50
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,299
but, for the sake of argument,
not a Muslim faith school,

51
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,779
which is not acceptable, and you've
got to have the same rule for all.

52
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,959
I understand Charles Clarke's desire

53
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,939
not to discriminate
against minority religions.

54
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,919
I agree we need one rule for all.

55
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,179
But I think the Government
turned the wrong way.

56
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,379
It should have abolished
the faith component altogether,

57
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,859
not rolled out more faith schools.

58
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,759
You can make a logical argument
- I completely understand it,

59
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,759
in fact, I first was a co-author of
a pamphlet about this in 1978 -

60
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,119
which says abolish all faith schools,

61
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,279
but I think you've then got to look
at how that relates

62
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,439
to what the population as a whole
feel about faith schools.

63
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,199
You wouldn't have to abolish them,

64
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,199
just stop supporting them
with Government money.

65
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,559
Well, that's the same
as abolishing them.

66
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,039
I mean the net effect of this

67
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,239
would be to close
thousands of schools.

68
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,279
Let the schools remain

69
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,479
but abolish the separation
between Catholic, Protestant...

70
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,999
You're saying take the money away
from the school which has that...

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,999
Yes. But the school could stay. It's
got the same buildings, teachers...

72
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,919
But you're taking away
90% of their revenue funding.

73
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,519
Closing these schools, which is I
think the effect of what you say,

74
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,879
is something
that wouldn't be accepted.

75
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,039
But it's their decision to close it.
They have the option.

76
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,825
I'm Secretary of State for Education,
and 4,000 schools are closed -

77
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,899
by their decision, not my decision -

78
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,999
but as a result of what I have said
hypothetically,

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,479
waving your big stick
which you've offered me.

80
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,479
I don't think that society
would accept that.

81
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,799
Having been a key player
in this huge gamble

82
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,799
with our country's education system,

83
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,419
you'd hope there'd be more
enthusiasm and conviction

84
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,739
in Charles Clarke's
backing for faith schools.

85
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,579
In fact, we find he used to be
against faith schools

86
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,419
and his main defence of them now

87
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:51,419
seems to be that voters
wouldn't agree to abolishing them.

88
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,059
And I'm not at all convinced

89
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,379
Charles Clarke is right
about public feeling.

90
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,899
In fact, we commissioned an
ICM opinion poll that showed

91
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,419
a clear majority, 59%,
still believed

92
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,419
that schools should be for everyone,
regardless of religion

93
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,499
and the Government should not be
funding faith schools of any kind.

94
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,359
I believe the Government must act

95
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,359
and take the faith
out of faith schools.

96
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,759
The first and most outwardly
dramatic change being brought about

97
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,759
by these schools has been a bizarre
distortion of parents' behaviour,

98
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,559
particularly in the push
for primary school places.

99
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,559
About 7% of the British
population worship in church.

100
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,679
But around 36% of primary schools
are run by the churches,

101
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,439
and they can select pupils on
the basis of parents' faith.

102
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,679
Parental choice?

103
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,279
OK, let's talk
about parental choice.

104
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,279
Suppose I'm a parent living with
my children exactly here in Oxford,

105
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,399
where we are standing now.

106
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,039
If we want a faith-based
primary school,

107
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,359
we've got all these red dots
to choose from

108
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,959
within easy walking distance.

109
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,119
St Phillip and St James,
there's St Aloysius,

110
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,959
a Catholic school, and there's St
Barnabas, another Anglican school.

111
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,679
But if we want a non-faith-based
school, we've got to go miles here,

112
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,359
here or here, or here.

113
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,559
Parents who wish to exercise
their choice

114
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,019
of a non-faith-based education
for their children

115
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,139
are, effectively,
discriminated against.

116
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,839
They're excluded
from one third of British

117
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,260
state-funded primary schools.

118
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,879
How do parents feel about this?

119
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,259
I've come to Mumsnet.

120
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,499
Justine?

121
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,299
Richard! How nice to meet you.

122
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,379
Hello, Justine,
thank you very much for having me.

123
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,019
Welcome to Mumsnet Towers.

124
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:51,019
Mumsnet is a web forum where parents
get together online using pseudonyms

125
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,619
to chat freely about issues
involving their children.

126
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,619
I'm here to ask about their
experience of faith schools.

127
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,039
Slug is saying it's not that
we were forced into a choice,

128
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,679
it's that we were excluded
from state-funded schools

129
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,119
because of our lack of faith.

130
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,550
It would be unacceptable, of course,
to exclude people on the basis

131
00:07:10,551 --> 00:07:14,499
of their race, but somehow it's OK
if it's their parents' religion.

132
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,759
Joe Bauwens's son is excluded

133
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,039
from all three of the local
primary schools,

134
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,879
two Anglican and one Catholic,

135
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,039
on the grounds that his parents
are not churchgoers.

136
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,999
Oh, God, there's so much going
on, I can't keep up. Hang on.

137
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,999
If parents don't want their children
to be excluded, the other option,

138
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,339
of course, is to fake a faith.

139
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,119
"Our neighbours trot along to church
every Sunday,

140
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,719
"rolling their eyes as they go,

141
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,159
"all so their children
can go to the local school."

142
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,159
We seem to be hearing that
again and again.

143
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,039
I went to meet one couple
who wanted to send their daughter

144
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,879
to what they thought
was the best school in their area,

145
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,359
a Catholic primary.

146
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,759
But the problem was they
weren't practising Catholics.

147
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,330
The SATs was 100%.

148
00:08:02,331 --> 00:08:06,159
So, first child, you just want
the best for your child.

149
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:09,059
Yeah, we spent four years
going to church,

150
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,979
you know, doing the right thing.

151
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,619
You went in order
to get the child into the school?

152
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,139
Yeah, we went to church every Sunday.

153
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,659
Yeah, that's part of the criteria,
attendance.

154
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,639
The parish priest
has to sort of sign you off.

155
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,879
He stood at the door and ticked
your name off as you went in?

156
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,879
Not quite, but almost. After church,
everyone was crowding the priest

157
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,739
to say,
"Hi, look, I'm here, I'm here."

158
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,199
Helen converted to Catholicism.
Didn't you?

159
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,759
Converted to Catholicism? From what?

160
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,319
From Protestant.

161
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,479
You were brought up...

162
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,559
Plymouth Brethren.

163
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,879
Plymouth Brethren in Scotland.

164
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,952
Yeah, so that was my commitment
to my daughter.

165
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,919
Did you have to do anything else?
Any other hoops to jump through?

166
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,759
Be nice to the priest.

167
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,919
Be nice to the priest
in what sort of way?

168
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,079
Well, if he had a cough,
you would get him some cough mixture

169
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,079
or just generally feed his ego.

170
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,039
That's not too serious bribery,

171
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,639
was there anything
more serious than that?

172
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,159
I...

173
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,159
It got to the stage where it
was sort of hinted at

174
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,799
that things like, you know,
the church roof needed fixing

175
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,039
and, you know, the fee of 5,000
was sort of bandied about.

176
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,999
5,000?

177
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,359
That if you sort of contributed
that amount,

178
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,439
your child was guaranteed
a place in school.

179
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,819
If you gave 5,000 to the church,

180
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,404
you would get your child
into school?

181
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,599
Yeah, yeah. Oh, absolutely.

182
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,658
It's not money to him,
but if his church looks like

183
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,799
its getting bums on seats
on Sunday, erm,

184
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,839
if the coffers are full,
he's doing a good job, isn't he?

185
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,039
He actually said that to me.
It's about bums on seats.

186
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,820
We contacted the priest in question.

187
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:50,864
He denied these claims
and stated he had nothing to do

188
00:09:50,865 --> 00:09:54,573
with admissions, which were
dealt with by an independent body.

189
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,383
Of other faiths,
the Church of England told us

190
00:09:57,384 --> 00:09:59,279
that not every admission
to their schools

191
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,139
is based on parents' religion

192
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,619
and it hopes no parent feels
compelled to worship

193
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,779
to secure their child a place.

194
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,918
The Board of Deputies of British
Jews makes no apology that parents

195
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,919
must demonstrate a commitment to
the values and ethos of Judaism.

196
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,079
But why are parents
who hold no faith

197
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,919
sending their children
to faith schools?

198
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,799
It seems to be about results.

199
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,679
League tables show that,
of primaries last year

200
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,679
with perfect SATs scores,
two thirds were church-run.

201
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,999
So what's going on?
Are faith schools better?

202
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,013
Surely God isn't
helping pupils in exams?

203
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:46,619
Through a massive analysis of half
a million primary school pupils,

204
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,499
this man has now has
the authoritative answer.

205
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,979
We can compare children
who live in the same postcode,

206
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,859
so you're comparing houses next
to each other, and if you do this,

207
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,521
and compare children in these
very similar circumstances,

208
00:10:59,687 --> 00:11:01,964
one going to a faith school, one not,

209
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,239
you find actually the rate at which
these children progress

210
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,279
is very, very similar.

211
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,469
There's not much of a performance
advantage measured on these terms.

212
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:13,579
The upshot is that
all the performance advantage

213
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:17,299
we observe for faith schools is to do
with the motivation of the parents,

214
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,099
it's to do with the background,
you know, their wealth.

215
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,580
So the evidence suggests
that the idea

216
00:11:23,581 --> 00:11:27,639
that improved results in faith
schools are due to faith is a myth.

217
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,879
It's about the social level of
pupils and the pushiness of parents

218
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:35,319
prepared to jump through hoops
to get their children selected.

219
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,679
Do we conclude from this
that parents are wasting their time

220
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,519
struggling to get their children
into a faith school?

221
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,279
Looking at the data we've got,

222
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:47,279
that's the conclusion
you would come to.

223
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,419
It might seem there's nothing deeply
wrong with parents

224
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,699
making a pact with beliefs
they don't hold

225
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,619
in order to get their children
into faith schools -

226
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,379
a little harmless hypocrisy,
perhaps.

227
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:03,259
But I worry that these parents
may be unwittingly

228
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:07,259
saddling their children with ways of
thinking that are hard to shake off.

229
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,959
One in three schools in Britain
is now a faith school,

230
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,599
and their number is increasing

231
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,799
throughout
our green and pleasant land.

232
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,348
As a non-believer,

233
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:34,299
I have concerns about this, but not
for the reasons you might imagine.

234
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,659
"Remember now thy Creator
in the days of thy youth.

235
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,659
"While the evil days come not,
nor the years draw nigh
when thou shalt say,

236
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,883
"I have no pleasure in them."

237
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,119
Perhaps surprisingly,
I'm in favour of religious literacy.

238
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,639
As we glide over the English
countryside,

239
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:00,068
I really feel that
in order to understand England,
the village cricket matches,

240
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,479
Evensong, harvest festivals,
the weddings and christenings,

241
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,618
you need to have an appreciation
of the cultural heritage of England,

242
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,279
and that includes Christianity.

243
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:17,011
Equally, if you're to understand
our wider world,

244
00:13:17,012 --> 00:13:21,019
the Muslim Koran and
Hindu Bhagavad-Gita deserve study.

245
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:32,905
"Stay me with flagons, comfort me
with apples, for I am sick of love."

246
00:13:34,406 --> 00:13:37,428
It's not all that surprising that I
enjoy the reading the Bible so much,

247
00:13:37,429 --> 00:13:40,919
because, at least in the
17th-century King James version,

248
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,879
it is most beautiful English.

249
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,079
"Go to the ant, thou sluggard.
Consider her ways and be wise."

250
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,423
"Spare the rod and spoil the child."

251
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,479
"Of making many books
there is no end."

252
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,479
These phrases and hundreds like them

253
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,359
suffuse our literature
and our language.

254
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,359
You can't appreciate Shakespeare
unless you are steeped in the Bible.

255
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,799
While I think it's important
all schools teach about
the culture of religion,

256
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:17,139
I'm worried that faith schools
are allowed to do far more.

257
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,939
Even the mild old Church of England
has openly set out its aim,

258
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,979
through the Archbishops' Council,

259
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:31,979
for its some 5,000 schools
to "nourish those of the faith,

260
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:36,139
"encourage those of other faiths,
challenge those who have no faith."

261
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,239
What does that mean for those
on the sharp end, our children?

262
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,599
I suppose what we are trying
to indoctrinate into is...

263
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,119
a view that faith matters.

264
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:55,419
What you would expect here
is to find that collective worship
means something.

265
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:00,219
But the main aim is not just to learn
about the major faiths,

266
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:05,259
but to have something
of an experience of faith.

267
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,659
One of the things that's very
difficult to do when you're older

268
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,259
is to make a decision on something

269
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,379
about which you know nothing
and have experienced nothing.

270
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,779
So it would be very easy
for someone to say,

271
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,699
"Oh, religion's all a load of rot,"

272
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:21,699
without actually ever having
encountered what it's like lived.

273
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,379
And so the Christian Foundation
enables some of that to be part

274
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:30,219
of these children's experience,
not in a way that expects them

275
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:34,099
to sign on the dotted line,
but to say, "This is what it is like,

276
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:38,099
"it's part of your learning and
your education to see how it works."

277
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,779
Janina Ainsworth
and I disagree here.

278
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:50,739
She feels it's important to
experience faith in school,

279
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:54,739
but for me,
this is indoctrinating children
too young to defend themselves.

280
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:01,838
I worry that religions like
getting to children young

281
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,626
precisely because that's when they
are at their most impressionable.

282
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,605
I'm going to show you
what it's going to make next.

283
00:16:08,608 --> 00:16:11,799
It's going to be a box.

284
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,039
Are you ready for the box?

285
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,079
Yes!

286
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,719
OK. There.

287
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,399
There's a box.
Do you see its lids there?

288
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,559
I can make a hat out of it.

289
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,079
What, like that?

290
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,999
LAUGHTER

291
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,999
No! Put it on me!

292
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,439
Thank you.

293
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,999
'Some sixty years on from
my childhood, I can still remember

294
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,827
'how to fold a piece of paper
into a Chinese-style boat.

295
00:16:38,828 --> 00:16:40,321
'It was a craze at my school.'

296
00:16:40,322 --> 00:16:42,759
This is going to be...
This is the difficult bit now.

297
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,147
Pulling that out, pulling that out,

298
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,162
and pulling up the sails,
and it's a boat!

299
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:56,800
Windmill Primary School in Oxford
is no faith school,

300
00:16:56,802 --> 00:17:00,479
but I've come here to demonstrate
children's natural propensity

301
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,559
to absorb new information.

302
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,046
A sailor

303
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:10,059
went to sea, sea, sea...

304
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:14,059
'I've reminded one pupil of
a well-known clapping game.'

305
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:24,459
Within minutes, others pick up
the game, pass it on to friends,

306
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,979
make connections
and adapt it with variations.

307
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,199
Children love to imitate,
they love to join in.

308
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,519
There's something compelling
about ideas

309
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,719
and the way they spread through
minds that are a bit like sponges.

310
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,039
What children absorb at a young age
can last a lifetime.

311
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,319
Should it really be the dogma
and daily rituals of religion?

312
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:07,679
And faith schools do much more,
of course, than hymns and prayers.

313
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,999
The hard edge of the indoctrination
goes on in RE, religious education,

314
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,959
for which many faith schools
teach their own syllabus,

315
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,039
and often parents contribute
money for the lessons.

316
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,839
We weren't granted access to film
any RE or faith studies

317
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,513
at a Jewish or Catholic school.

318
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,679
So I turned to someone who has
systematically collected information

319
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,119
for years on what actually goes on.

320
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,239
The problem is
that it is totally deregulated.

321
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,119
The governing bodies
of state-funded faith schools

322
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,279
have control over their
religious education curriculum.

323
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,239
Ofsted inspects
the religious education
in other state-funded schools,

324
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,239
but state-funded religious schools
have their own religious
inspectorates to inspect lessons.

325
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,159
And that really compounds
problems in other subjects.

326
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,188
So a lot of faith schools,
particularly Catholic schools,

327
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,699
will teach their sex and relations
education in their RE.

328
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,799
Lots of faith schools do the same
with citizenship education.
So those subjects become

329
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,599
seen through a religious filter.

330
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,479
How much time do they actually spend

331
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,599
on faith
as opposed to ordinary education?

332
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,761
Well, we have an example here
of a state-funded
Jewish faith school,

333
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,639
where in Year Seven, that's
the first form in secondary school,

334
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,559
pupils have eight hours
of religious instruction

335
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:30,559
every fortnight, which compares with
six hours per fortnight for science

336
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,900
and far outweighs any subject
in the secular curriculum.

337
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,599
One faith was brave enough
to open its doors to filming.

338
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,199
Right, come on, girls.
Right, now, we know what

339
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,519
we're going to do this lesson.
We're going to do some drama.

340
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:08,519
I'm just thinking to myself,
how universal is this story?

341
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,719
Back then, everything was
according to the family.
You've got to obey them...

342
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,719
This is Madani High School,
an all-Muslim secondary school
in Leicester

343
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,239
and one of 11 Muslim faithschools
now in the state system.

344
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,759
I've come to see first hand
how faith and education mix.

345
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,526
This school gets good results,
and many of the girls here hope

346
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:34,579
to become the next generation
of lawyers, doctors and teachers.

347
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,159
Faith schools are sometimes accused
of closing children's minds down

348
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,759
by teaching them this is the one
true faith and you get your truth

349
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,933
from Holy Scripture rather than
from opening your mind to the world.

350
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:50,379
That's slightly a misunderstanding
from those who think that.

351
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:53,019
If you come to our school
and look at our lessons,

352
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,779
we're very much open minds,
thinking critically,

353
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:59,779
understanding the world
in a very critical fashion.

354
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:04,299
Like all state schools, they teach
national curriculum science here.

355
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:09,307
But, like many faith schools,
they supplement this

356
00:21:09,308 --> 00:21:11,539
with religious lessons
that they control

357
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:14,739
and which are not subject
to Ofsted inspection.

358
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,439
In our school, when our teachers
tell us stuff, like,

359
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,319
teach us stuff, it's up to us
whether we believe it or not.

360
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,441
The teachers do not
disrespect our decision.

361
00:21:24,459 --> 00:21:27,425
Everybody has a right to their own
decision, at the end of the day.

362
00:21:27,432 --> 00:21:30,959
Suppose we take a fact like,
are we and chimpanzees cousins?

363
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,319
Do you believe that
we're cousins of chimpanzees?

364
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,759
Or monkeys?

365
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,079
I wouldn't think so.

366
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,319
Perhaps we have
a science teacher here.

367
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,359
What do you teach about that?

368
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:46,279
We learn in the curriculum,
because that's what we follow,

369
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,799
we teach them
the theory of evolution,

370
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,079
but then I do tell them
we in Islam,

371
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:55,039
our opinion about it, and the girls
will also have their own opinion

372
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:59,039
and ask questions, "So, Miss,
do we really come from chimpanzees?"

373
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,119
But they all have their own opinions
for that, and they'll

374
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,119
come to their own decision, which
every single one of them realise

375
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,559
that actually we didn't,
because we believe differently.

376
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,559
Every single one of them
comes to the conclusion
that we did not evolve?

377
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,479
Yes.

378
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,639
Everybody in your science class,
everybody in the school

379
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,119
comes to that conclusion?

380
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,839
Well, in my class, yes, they did.

381
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,479
How many is that?

382
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,319
Well, I teach 60 Year Ten students,
so 60 of them.

383
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,999
And all 60 of them

384
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,319
end up rejecting evolution?

385
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,319
Yes, because, obviously, they have
their beliefs, which is Islam.

386
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,079
Yeah, about evolution.

387
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,039
Evolution is that
human evolved from apes and stuff,

388
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,879
but if there are still apes here,
then how did humans evolve from apes?

389
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,879
This is the commonest question
I get. What's the answer of your
science teacher to that?

390
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,599
I wanted to know your opinion.

391
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,599
I'm going to give you the answer,
but we've been told that
your science teacher teaches

392
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,399
the theory of evolution.
I'm interested to know...

393
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,399
That's exactly what we teach them,
that humans evolved from apes

394
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,599
and through natural selection
we became humans.

395
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,639
But her question is
why are there still apes?

396
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,319
Mm. Erm...

397
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,479
I'll tell you why
there are still apes.

398
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,479
Firstly, we are not just
evolved from apes, weareapes.

399
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,279
And when animals evolve from
other animals,

400
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,519
it's not that they supersede them.

401
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,959
It's not that we've evolved
from chimpanzees.

402
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,959
Chimpanzees and we have evolved
from a shared ancestor

403
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,719
who lived about
six million years ago

404
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,999
and who was neither a human
nor a chimpanzee.

405
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,359
'There's a bigger point at stake
here than evolution, of course.

406
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:48,359
'What's worrying is that a school
that says it wants its pupils to be
open-minded is,

407
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,999
'through its religious training,
also guiding them to reject
factual evidence

408
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,959
'at the very core of science
and rational thought.

409
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,919
'Where does that lead?'

410
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,639
The school's job is to
provide all the information,

411
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,639
but it's up to individuals
to see what they believe
and what they don't believe,

412
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,959
so I'd like to leave the choices
to these young people.

413
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,799
So you think that
matters of scientific fact

414
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,679
are a matter of personal choice,
based on traditional faith?

415
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,399
Well, none of the reports
that I've read

416
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,239
says that
evolution is a scientific fact.

417
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,999
It just says there's a scientific
theory which says evolution is there.

418
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,999
There's another perspective,
from a faith perspective, that says

419
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,039
God created all human beings.

420
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,919
But I hope you'll see
that from our young people

421
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,999
evolution is only one small thing
in their lives

422
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,799
and probably an insignificant thing
in their lives.

423
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,999
It's not a small thing in the life
of a science teacher.

424
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,599
She will teach children
things which are...

425
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,599
contrary to the entire
scientific community.

426
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:55,359
Now, that's not a small thing,
that's actually quite a large thing.

427
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,359
If science says one thing
and the Koran says the other,
who do you go with?

428
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,039
Well, I'd like to believe
that because science,

429
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,799
scientific knowledge
and the Koran are

430
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,639
essentially from the same creator,
there won't be a conflict.

431
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,119
The conflict will probably arise
in our understanding of those facts.

432
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,359
That sounds reasonable to me.
My advice...

433
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,559
If you'll pardon me
for offering advice...

434
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,279
Please do.

435
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,639
You're never going to win the fight
against evolution. It is a fact.

436
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,799
What you should do

437
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,639
is look at the Koran

438
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,399
and reconcile it with evolution,
which is what Christians have done.

439
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,919
In RE, we learn about science and
the Koran. By the end of the day,

440
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,919
we all came to one conclusion, that
the Koran is evidence of science,

441
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,999
that what science has proved
to be just recently

442
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,959
is already proved in the Koran
1,400 years ago, when it was written.

443
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,159
But that doesn't include evolution,
apparently.

444
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,599
No.

445
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,559
So what does it include?

446
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:53,559
It includes stuff like the shape
of the earth, about the mountains,

447
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,079
how they secure the earth.

448
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,439
And how in the sea the two waters,
they don't mix,

449
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,159
the salty water
and the drinking water.

450
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,719
So it's pure for us to drink.

451
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,359
They don't mix,
but they pass through each other.

452
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,879
Salty water and fresh water
don't mix in the sea?

453
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,559
No. It's like...

454
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,319
It's a natural barrier.

455
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:17,319
I was shocked that
RE elbows out science like this.

456
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,559
So you think the Koran is a good
source of scientific information?

457
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,199
Yeah.

458
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,719
Yeah.
Right, yeah.

459
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,439
Right. And you're the one
who wants to be a doctor,

460
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,439
is that right? Yes.

461
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:41,639
I can't be sure indoctrination
triumphs over real learning
like this in other faith schools,

462
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,434
but I do worry there's nothing
to stop it happening.

463
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,559
I think RE must be taught critically

464
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:54,559
so that the factual evidence
of history and science
are properly respected.

465
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,599
In my view, RE should be
part of a national curriculum

466
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,639
and subject to Ofsted inspection,
like other subjects.

467
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,919
The Church of England told us
it wouldn't oppose
a national curriculum for RE,

468
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,559
and I welcome that.

469
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:13,877
The Board of Deputies of British
Jews claims critical thinking is

470
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,639
intrinsic to Jewish faith education,
and their inspectors

471
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,639
inspect their schools' RE in a way
that matches Ofsted requirements.

472
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,199
But then, why not let Ofsted inspect
their RE in the first place?

473
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:33,719
I think there's something deeper
going on here.

474
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:37,935
Supporters of faith schools claim
they're in some way necessary

475
00:27:37,936 --> 00:27:41,979
to allow groups
to hand their religious culture
down the generations.

476
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,439
I understand the argument.

477
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,999
But what is the impact of this
across our society?

478
00:27:48,534 --> 00:27:50,979
One former Muslim feels concerned

479
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:54,979
that faith schools are resurrecting
barriers where there need be none.

480
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:59,539
When I first arrived in the UK
back in the early 1970s,

481
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:03,539
myself, my friends, my family,
we encountered a lot of racism

482
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,119
and we often felt excluded.

483
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:10,521
And things have improved,
and it shocks me, it saddens me

484
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:14,539
that people like me are now
choosing to self-segregate,

485
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:21,818
when others have worked so hard
to allow us to mix and to join in

486
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:25,226
and to be part of a wider community.

487
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,463
For me, what's exciting
about the world is the range of ideas
we can encounter,

488
00:28:29,464 --> 00:28:32,259
and to separate yourself
off from that,

489
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:36,259
from the rest of humanity, frankly,
is deeply, deeply tragic.

490
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,387
Some faiths claim they actually
promote community cohesion

491
00:28:40,388 --> 00:28:44,399
through their schools, and that
this is recognised by Ofsted.

492
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,039
But, as we've seen, Ofsted doesn't
inspect what's taught

493
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,919
in faith schools' RE lessons,

494
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:53,023
nor does it consider
the schools' admission policies,

495
00:28:53,024 --> 00:28:55,834
which can discriminate
along religious lines.

496
00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:01,976
I'm worried that faith schools
in fact encourage separation
from mainstream society.

497
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:07,279
Now I want to ask how important
it is for parents to have the right

498
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:10,538
to preserve their culture
through their children's school

499
00:29:10,539 --> 00:29:15,294
or whether this creates
a dangerous and divisive
"them and us" mentality.

500
00:29:16,177 --> 00:29:21,744
FAITH SCHOOL MENACE?

501
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:26,636
Faith schools are
on the march in this country.

502
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:29,241
One of the key claims
of their supporters

503
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:33,119
is that they create a confident
sense of identity amongst pupils.

504
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:37,539
But that very sense of identity
sets them apart from others

505
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:41,539
schooled to believe in a different
God or a different theology.

506
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,659
In not mixing at school,

507
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:47,659
surely there's a danger that these
children will grow up as strangers.

508
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:59,079
We have a warning from our own
recent history about how destructive

509
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,239
faith education can be when
it helps forge tribal identities.

510
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,239
The human psyche has
two great sicknesses.

511
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:11,239
One is the urge to carry vendetta
across generations, and the other is

512
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,759
the tendency to fasten group labels
onto people

513
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,975
instead of seeing them
as individuals.

514
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,618
One of the great scars
is Northern Ireland,

515
00:30:21,633 --> 00:30:25,599
where you can see the badges
of Protestant-Catholic divide

516
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,199
on walls, in flags, on bunting,
wherever you look.

517
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,279
Nowadays some of this may be put on
for the benefit of gawping tourists.

518
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:44,259
Thankfully, Northern Ireland
seems on the verge of a new era.

519
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,499
Politicians, police and professions,

520
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,179
both Protestant and Catholic,
are working together.

521
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:55,490
But one area the Good Friday
Agreement couldn't touch,
tragically, was education,

522
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:59,779
which threatens to re-open
the sectarian divide.

523
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:04,219
For children, the tribal divisions
start in the nursery.

524
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,319
In July 2010, it was reported to be

525
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,559
children as young as nine
who led the riots,

526
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:20,559
throwing stones and shouting abuse
at the other side.

527
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:31,239
Around 95% of pupils in Northern
Ireland go to either a Catholic

528
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,879
or a Protestant faith school.

529
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,999
Most of them never
have the opportunity

530
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,079
for a proper conversation
with a member of the other faith.

531
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,719
They usually marry
into the same faith

532
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,559
and, if they meet in the workplace,

533
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:47,559
it's only because of strict
employment laws to promote equality.

534
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,719
Surely, here of all places, they
can't see segregated faith schools

535
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,439
as a good thing?

536
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,559
Surely they should welcome mixing up

537
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,359
Protestant and Catholic
school populations?

538
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,298
At present,

539
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:25,463
the overwhelming majority of
Catholics go to so called Catholic
maintained schools,

540
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,019
Protestants to
Controlled state schools.

541
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,939
I want to meet both sides.

542
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:35,239
I think it just boils down
to choice, and I believe,

543
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:39,479
for me, the Controlled sector have
the schools with the history,

544
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,599
with the record
of academic achievement.

545
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,648
That's where I'd want my children
to go. But increasingly, parents
look at what are the best schools.

546
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,075
The hard reality is surely that
there's very little crossover,
is there?

547
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,567
One might say that humans are
innately driven to be divisive and
to form tribes and to separate out,

548
00:32:56,568 --> 00:32:59,079
and there are plenty of ways
in which that can happen -

549
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,559
skin colour, language - but religion
is a pretty good one to do it with,

550
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,479
and isn't it a gratuitous one
that we could do without?

551
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,919
Oh, certainly not. Religion has
been here for thousands of years

552
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,239
and will continue to be
until the Lord comes back again.

553
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,224
But does it have to be so divisive?

554
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:16,019
I personally don't
see it as divisive.

555
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,862
You don't? You live in Ulster
and you don't see it as divisive?

556
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:20,459
No, I don't see it as...

557
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,779
I see it as us having differences

558
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,102
and hopefully we can work
through those differences.

559
00:33:26,146 --> 00:33:29,659
The differences relate to our
theology, the way we worship.

560
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:34,860
I believe all our churches are in
need of a Reformation and I'd love
to see another Reformation come.

561
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:49,899
Perhaps at the deepest level of
my concern about faith schools

562
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,502
is the assumption I'm encountering
that children are somehow

563
00:33:53,503 --> 00:33:57,639
the property of their parents,
and their parents' religion.

564
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,719
It's all about parents' choice,

565
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:06,019
and I found that strongly echoed
on the Catholic side.

566
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:14,719
MAN: Our Catholic schools,
our Catholic ethos adds value,

567
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,436
gives a sense of belonging,
a sense of community.

568
00:34:17,452 --> 00:34:20,080
That's what parents
want for their children.

569
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:23,199
A child, to a parent,
is a very blessed thing,

570
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,958
and the vast majority, almost all
parents, will do what they think

571
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,959
is right for their child.
Is that not a legitimate human right?

572
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,159
Oh, it's certainly legitimate.

573
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,679
Oh, it's certainly legitimate.
But you don't agree with that?

574
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,959
Well, I have all sorts of issues
with faith schools...

575
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:41,919
But you clearly don't agree
with that. Let you state that.

576
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:45,839
OK, I worry about segregation
of children in any way,

577
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:51,439
not just in Northern Ireland,
on the basis of their parents'
religious opinions,

578
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,679
because it seems to me
that religious opinion is

579
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:58,119
a pretty odd way in which
to separate children out.

580
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:01,799
Richard, I think we need to nail this
one - do you believe that parents

581
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,799
have the human right to choose the
education for their children or not?

582
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,039
Well, I think they do...

583
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,559
That's the core of
what you're asking me.

584
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,519
Do you afford parents the human
right, and it is a human right...

585
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:14,959
I also...

586
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,239
..to choose the system of education

587
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:22,665
that they wish for their children
that's most consistent with their
beliefs and understanding of life?

588
00:35:22,666 --> 00:35:26,639
Now, you're seeking to impose
your view on other people,
and I think that's wrong.

589
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:30,799
I think you should respect everybody
from... Are you a parent yourself?

590
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,439
Yes.

591
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,759
Well, what do you have
for your children?

592
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,719
What do I..?

593
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,679
What do you have for your children,
what do you want them to do?

594
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:42,119
I want them to be open-minded.
I want them to be sceptical.

595
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,028
I want them to ask
critical questions.

596
00:35:44,072 --> 00:35:47,199
I want them to seek knowledge
for its own sake.

597
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,199
I do not want to impose
my own views on them.

598
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,079
Good. I respect that.

599
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:56,079
What you said is a perfectly
legitimate view,

600
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:59,439
but you should afford other people
the same respect.

601
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,799
Once you begin to engineer

602
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,679
or begin to thwart parents
in terms of parental choice,

603
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,839
you really enter dictatorship,
Richard,

604
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,599
maybe that's where you want to be.

605
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,159
No, I don't want to get into that...

606
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,519
No, I don't want to get into that...
But that's what you're
essentially saying.

607
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,519
You come at this from a premise that
here's what you think is right.

608
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,279
I'm coming from the premise

609
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,279
that parents should be
allowed to make choices.

610
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,870
I do believe in taking the faith
out of faith schools and, yes,

611
00:36:41,871 --> 00:36:46,125
that would impinge on both
Reverend Gibson and Mr Flanagan's
rights as parents

612
00:36:46,126 --> 00:36:48,261
to choose
their children's education.

613
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:51,013
But look at the result
of parents' rights

614
00:36:51,014 --> 00:36:53,779
as exercised in Northern Ireland.

615
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:57,659
Are parents' rights so important
that we allow them to risk

616
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:00,659
dividing the two communities
forever?

617
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:04,659
The trouble with rights is there are
conflicts between opposing rights.

618
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,259
What about the right of
free expression

619
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:10,099
versus the right not to be offended?

620
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:14,099
In the case of education, children
have rights as well as parents.

621
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,239
Children have the right
not to be indoctrinated,

622
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:20,560
not to have their parents' beliefs
forced down their throat,

623
00:37:20,561 --> 00:37:24,672
but to make up their own mind
after a proper, balanced education.

624
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:31,568
FAITH SCHOOL MENACE?

625
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,119
There goes a right-wing Tory child.

626
00:37:36,532 --> 00:37:38,559
I see there's a socialist child
over there,

627
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,799
a group of Lib Dem children
over there.

628
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:45,419
What we have got here? A group
of logical positivist children.

629
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,695
An existentialist child there.

630
00:37:49,129 --> 00:37:50,338
It's absurd, isn't it?

631
00:37:50,341 --> 00:37:53,221
We wouldn't dream of
labelling children like that.

632
00:37:53,226 --> 00:37:56,756
And yet, when it comes to religion,
our whole society is happy

633
00:37:56,757 --> 00:38:00,859
to talk about a Catholic child,
a Protestant child, a Muslim child.

634
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:05,219
Why the double standard?

635
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:12,339
I've already set out why I think
presumptions like this, rooted in

636
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:16,419
the very idea of faith schools,
are a growing menace.

637
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,799
But I don't want to just attack.

638
00:38:19,352 --> 00:38:22,299
I passionately believe
there is an alternative,

639
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:27,303
and I want to persuade you that
education is better without faith.

640
00:38:32,027 --> 00:38:34,228
I feel strongly about this because,

641
00:38:34,232 --> 00:38:38,239
when I was a boy, I thought very
traditionally and believed in God.

642
00:38:41,768 --> 00:38:43,314
But it was education

643
00:38:43,315 --> 00:38:47,526
that allowed me to change my mind
and unleashed my curiosity.

644
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:53,882
Any teacher or parent may
influence children in many ways.

645
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,388
We all have baggage.

646
00:38:55,484 --> 00:39:01,435
So how do we best respect
a child's right to learn
with a truly open mind?

647
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,899
Young children are uniquely
vulnerable to simply believing

648
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:10,621
what adults tell them,
so my starting point

649
00:39:10,622 --> 00:39:14,619
would be to give them tools
to sort fact from fiction.

650
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:20,396
When my daughter was ten, I decided
to write a letter to her asking her

651
00:39:20,397 --> 00:39:24,844
to think for herself about how
we know the things that we know.

652
00:39:24,845 --> 00:39:27,020
"How do we know, for instance,
that the stars,

653
00:39:27,021 --> 00:39:29,372
"which look like tiny pinpricks
in the sky,

654
00:39:29,373 --> 00:39:33,104
"are really huge balls of fire like
the sun and are very far away?"

655
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:37,419
I mentioned one good reason
to believe anything's true,
which is evidence,

656
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:39,523
and I mentioned three bad reasons.

657
00:39:39,537 --> 00:39:42,588
There's tradition,
"Believe it because our people

658
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:46,379
"have always believed it, it's
been handed down over generations".

659
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,614
"The trouble with tradition
is that no matter how long ago

660
00:39:49,615 --> 00:39:50,866
"a story was made up,

661
00:39:50,867 --> 00:39:54,439
"it is still exactly as true or
untrue as the original story was."

662
00:39:54,562 --> 00:39:56,519
There's authority,

663
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,867
"Believe it because your parents do,
believe it because a priest does,

664
00:39:59,868 --> 00:40:03,725
"believe it because a teacher does
or because a holy book does".

665
00:40:03,726 --> 00:40:06,210
That's another bad reason
to believe anything.

666
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,179
And finally "revelation",

667
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:12,179
believe something because it just
feels right. "And next time somebody

668
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:15,259
"tells you that something is true,
why not say to them,

669
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:17,539
"'What kind of evidence
is there for that?'

670
00:40:18,216 --> 00:40:20,671
And if they can't give you
a good answer,

671
00:40:20,672 --> 00:40:24,679
"I hope you'll think very carefully
before you believe a word they say.

672
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:28,919
"Your loving Daddy."

673
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,839
I'm fascinated by the way

674
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:41,839
children start piecing
together how the world works.

675
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,338
I've come back to Windmill Primary
School to look at

676
00:40:49,339 --> 00:40:52,599
a new scientific study of how
children are naturally biased

677
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:56,599
to believe certain kinds of
ultimately religious explanations.

678
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:03,723
We've used a variety of different
methods, just asking children

679
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:07,835
to spontaneously tell you what they
think about the origins of things,

680
00:41:07,836 --> 00:41:11,271
and also then sort of presenting
them with answers.

681
00:41:11,274 --> 00:41:13,079
So we are going to play a game.

682
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,946
We're going to look at
some pictures...

683
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,001
Dr Deborah Kelemen
is a leading child psychologist

684
00:41:18,002 --> 00:41:19,714
at Boston University.

685
00:41:19,715 --> 00:41:23,540
You have to pick the answer
that makes most sense to you.

686
00:41:23,541 --> 00:41:27,130
In this experiment, she poses
the children questions like,

687
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,113
"Why are rocks pointy?"

688
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,999
One person says they were pointy
because little bits of stuff

689
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:38,159
piled up on top of one another over
a long time, and another person said

690
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:42,159
they were pointy so animals could
scratch on them when they got itchy.

691
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,239
What answer makes more sense to you?

692
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,679
The animal one

693
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:52,132
with the... scratch,
to make itchy.

694
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,739
OK, then.

695
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:56,135
All right.
And here's another one.

696
00:41:56,136 --> 00:42:00,258
What you find is that kids have
a tendency clearly from about four
years of age

697
00:42:02,192 --> 00:42:05,599
to endorse a purpose-based
explanation or to

698
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:09,459
give you a purpose-based explanation
for the origins of things.

699
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,159
Another question she asks the
children is, "Why are lakes still?"

700
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:18,019
One person thought they were still
and didn't have waves

701
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:22,019
so animals could cool off in them
without being washed away,

702
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,039
and another person thought they were
still and didn't have waves

703
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,839
because no moving water
ever ran into them.

704
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:30,259
Which answer make more sense to you?

705
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:32,899
Animals can be cool
without being washed away.

706
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,659
So that animals could be cool
without being washed away?

707
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:38,459
Animals could wash in them
and don't get washed away.

708
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,259
OK, brilliant.

709
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,779
Because no moving water.

710
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:44,339
OK, excellent.

711
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:48,339
'I suppose a child is surrounded in
the home by artefacts, telephones

712
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,479
'and televisions,

713
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:52,399
all things which actuallyare
designed for a purpose.'

714
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,919
What we're finding right now

715
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,559
is that children really start to do
this at the point where they start

716
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:00,999
to understand that artefacts
are objects that have been made

717
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,723
by someone for a purpose, and that
might be orienting them towards

718
00:43:04,724 --> 00:43:07,559
an understanding that things are
intentionally caused,

719
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:12,246
intentionally designed and then,
once they understand that, yes,

720
00:43:12,247 --> 00:43:16,207
they're surrounded by these objects
that are intentionally designed,

721
00:43:16,208 --> 00:43:19,691
then going, "Well, that's quite
a good way to understand everything."

722
00:43:19,692 --> 00:43:23,142
Do you think children can be
described as natural creationists?

723
00:43:23,144 --> 00:43:29,408
In some sense yes, insofar as they
are attracted to and spontaneously

724
00:43:29,409 --> 00:43:34,912
invoke notions that things exist for
purposes and that's associated with

725
00:43:34,913 --> 00:43:39,439
their notions that these things
have been intentionally caused

726
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,119
for a purpose. In many respects,

727
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:46,119
it mimics what's seen in
religion as creationism.

728
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,119
Are you up for that?

729
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:48,999
I think so.

730
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,820
You think so. Brilliant!

731
00:43:52,261 --> 00:43:56,319
So children naturally tend to assume
meaning and purpose in things

732
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,879
even where there is none.

733
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:01,486
This, of course, gives religions,
with their own presumptuous,

734
00:44:01,487 --> 00:44:05,499
but unfounded, sense of purpose
and meaning, a peculiar advantage.

735
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:09,097
That's why it's all the more
important that religion

736
00:44:09,098 --> 00:44:13,139
is put in its proper place, as it is
in normal schools like Windmill,

737
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:17,219
and not allowed to get in the way
of children's questioning minds.

738
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:24,139
Rather than indoctrinating children

739
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:27,539
in faiths that can only preach a
limited view on the deep questions

740
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:32,619
of existence, how much better
instead to fire children's curiosity

741
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:36,619
about all the extraordinary
questions we have yet to answer.

742
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:47,539
'At Windmill School, I'm going
to take an alternative assembly.

743
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:51,954
'I'm hoping I can share with
these children something of

744
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:54,302
'what I wrote to my own daughter

745
00:44:54,303 --> 00:44:56,546
'and get them to ask me questions.'

746
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:02,119
When I was your age,
I pretty much thought that anything

747
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:04,799
that a grown-up said must be true.

748
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,519
But that can't be right, can it?

749
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:10,472
Because grown-ups say different
things, and they don't always agree.

750
00:45:10,498 --> 00:45:12,399
How do we know what's true?

751
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,799
You've probably all heard
about a great big,

752
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,679
meat-eating dinosaur called...
Do you know what that's called?

753
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:21,799
T. Rex.

754
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,359
T. Rex. That's right.

755
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:29,715
Yeah. Tyrannosaurus Rex
Now, if I tell you that T. Rex was

756
00:45:29,716 --> 00:45:35,046
about as long as a double-decker bus
and was taller than an elephant,

757
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:41,670
it'd be very sensible of you to ask
me: "how I know these amazing things?"

758
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:44,384
So evidence is a
good reason for believing...

759
00:45:44,385 --> 00:45:47,089
'Our greatest
responsibility in education

760
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:52,412
'is to unleash children's curiosity
and never limit their questions.'

761
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:55,819
"You and I are really very lucky.

762
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:59,819
"We're lucky because we live in
a country with a long history

763
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:04,039
"of thinking for ourselves
and asking questions.

764
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,799
"We're lucky because we live in

765
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:11,132
"the most extraordinary world,
the real world, of real evidence.

766
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:18,628
"And I hope you'll enjoy finding
out much more about its wonders."

767
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:26,139
(INDISTINCT QUESTION)

768
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:29,019
Yes, well, horseshoe crabs
haven't changed very much.

769
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:32,099
Lots of other things have
changed a lot since that time.

770
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:33,979
How did the sun come?

771
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:37,452
How did the sun come?
Well, the sun came from a huge,

772
00:46:37,453 --> 00:46:42,387
great cloud of gas which came
from an earlier star that exploded.

773
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,139
How did the dinosaurs die?

774
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:48,459
Well, probably what happened
was there were lots of fires.

775
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:52,459
And there was huge lot of steam
and smoke and dust, and a great big

776
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:57,219
cloud formed all around the earth
and so the sun couldn't get through.

777
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:01,183
That's what people think,
but nobody really knows,

778
00:47:01,184 --> 00:47:05,639
and you have to ask,
"what the evidence for that is?"
