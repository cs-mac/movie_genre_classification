00:00:26,928 --> 00:00:27,932
Yuto!

3
00:00:32,006 --> 00:00:35,242
They always play with our emotions.

4
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:38,906
Hey.

5
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:41,175
- Hello. / - You've grown a lot.

6
00:00:41,175 --> 00:00:43,202
Hello.

7
00:00:43,445 --> 00:00:45,313
Everything works out for him.

8
00:00:48,055 --> 00:00:51,082
They make us laugh with their comments.

9
00:00:55,123 --> 00:00:56,126
Are you happy?

10
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:04,598
Sunghoon, you watching this?

11
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:08,604
They make every moment shine.

12
00:01:08,703 --> 00:01:11,038
Strawberry, may I pick you?

13
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:12,506
Can I eat you?

14
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:15,010
They're like the spring in our hearts.

15
00:01:15,051 --> 00:01:17,319
What kind of spring will the Supermen

16
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:19,580
spend with their children

17
00:01:19,058 --> 00:01:21,394
in the 48 hours they have without mom?

18
00:01:22,045 --> 00:01:24,546
The Return of Superman. Episode 19.

19
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:26,955
"You Are My Spring."

20
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:29,890
It's already the second spring of their lives

21
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,324
for the twins.

22
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:32,793
They look like some kind of

23
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:34,795
Mongolian tribe dressed in this.

24
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:36,063
Are you going somewhere today?

25
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:38,120
Are you going to herd sheep? Seoeon?

26
00:01:38,633 --> 00:01:40,535
Going to herd some sheep?

27
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:47,775
Daddy.

28
00:01:48,061 --> 00:01:49,127
- Honey. / - What's this?

29
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:51,773
This is for Seojun...

30
00:01:53,748 --> 00:01:55,516
When you take him outside.

31
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:03,725
Please dress him in this.

32
00:02:03,725 --> 00:02:05,793
They've never tried this on before.

33
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:06,861
Seojun's going to wear it.

34
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:08,630
- Honey! / - It'll be too hard to wear this.

35
00:02:08,063 --> 00:02:10,431
- You only have one baby today. / - I know. Okay.

36
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:12,933
- I know. / - It's just one today.

37
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:15,470
Seoeon, let's go on a date with mommy.

38
00:02:16,938 --> 00:02:20,641
We've always thought lightly of Seojun.

39
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:23,110
We just thought he had a good personality

40
00:02:23,011 --> 00:02:25,414
and wasn't shy and was good with everyone.

41
00:02:25,513 --> 00:02:27,781
But when I think about how Seojun must've felt,

42
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:30,918
I feel so sorry. So...

43
00:02:32,082 --> 00:02:33,650
Why am I crying?

44
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:39,793
In the psychological test last episode,

45
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:41,730
Seojun showed that

46
00:02:41,073 --> 00:02:43,441
he was a little unstable compared to his brother.

47
00:02:47,435 --> 00:02:50,138
They just thought he was gentle.

48
00:02:50,138 --> 00:02:54,675
But he would've wanted just as much attention.

49
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,711
Why couldn't they see that earlier?

50
00:02:57,478 --> 00:02:58,746
Daddy's here.

51
00:02:58,746 --> 00:03:03,351
We didn't pay enough attention as parents.

52
00:03:03,885 --> 00:03:06,486
But we couldn't help it since we have twins.

53
00:03:07,155 --> 00:03:11,793
I know it won't be easy for my wife but...

54
00:03:11,793 --> 00:03:14,061
This time we decided to take care of one kid each.

55
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:17,098
And if this succeeds, we'll maintain this format.

56
00:03:19,006 --> 00:03:20,874
- Honey. Honey? / - Yes?

57
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:23,270
You've been away from the kids

58
00:03:23,027 --> 00:03:25,230
2 days at a time.

59
00:03:25,473 --> 00:03:27,408
But this is my first time.

60
00:03:27,408 --> 00:03:29,343
I feel really sad all of a sudden.

61
00:03:30,178 --> 00:03:31,946
Why? You always said it'd be nice with just one.

62
00:03:31,946 --> 00:03:33,615
I know but...

63
00:03:33,615 --> 00:03:36,702
It's a first for me. Not seeing them for a day.

64
00:03:37,485 --> 00:03:41,421
I'm getting really emotional...

65
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:45,086
You'll realize that having both is the best, right?

66
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:51,398
You'll never say you wish you only had one.

67
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:55,870
Since you've always felt bad to Seojun,

68
00:03:55,087 --> 00:03:57,388
you shouldn't feel sad today.

69
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:00,575
Make sure you have heaps of fun today.

70
00:04:00,575 --> 00:04:02,510
- Of course... / - Daddy!

71
00:04:02,051 --> 00:04:06,154
Once you take Seoeon, I'll get really happy again.

72
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:10,051
That's right. We've always wanted to try this.

73
00:04:10,051 --> 00:04:12,053
We should do it.

74
00:04:12,053 --> 00:04:14,355
Can I leave it to you and get ready?

75
00:04:14,355 --> 00:04:15,923
- Get ready for what? / - To go out.

76
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:17,725
Of course. But aren't you finished?

77
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:19,093
Your makeup looks ready.

78
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:20,928
No, I have more to do.

79
00:04:23,398 --> 00:04:25,600
And these are home clothes. I have to get changed.

80
00:04:25,006 --> 00:04:26,039
That's home clothes?

81
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:29,270
I've never seen them before.

82
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:32,406
I wore this dress in the past.

83
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:33,941
I've seen the dress but I've never seen that top.

84
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:36,845
You bought this for me. We went together.

85
00:04:47,755 --> 00:04:49,782
Seoeon, come here. Seoeon!

86
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:52,260
Lee Seoeon!

87
00:04:53,428 --> 00:04:54,561
- Mama! / - Hello.

88
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:57,198
- Mommy. Just wait. / - Hello.

89
00:04:58,265 --> 00:04:59,933
Just a minute.

90
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:08,307
What was that? I think I just saw a cheetah run by.

91
00:05:10,011 --> 00:05:14,148
Seoeon, I think I saw a cheetah race by.

92
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:15,216
Do I look hot?

93
00:05:15,216 --> 00:05:18,051
Oh, it was mommy.

94
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,713
I'm going on a date with my Seoeon.

95
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:25,720
Seoeon and I are going on a nice date.

96
00:05:28,963 --> 00:05:30,398
You like that?

97
00:05:30,398 --> 00:05:31,665
You like it?

98
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:32,700
Seoeon?

99
00:05:32,007 --> 00:05:33,608
Let's go now.

100
00:05:35,047 --> 00:05:36,648
How exciting.

101
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:40,208
Goodbye. See you tomorrow.

102
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,310
Your outfit...

103
00:05:43,031 --> 00:05:45,118
- Is it hot? / - It looks like my aunt's clothes.

104
00:05:47,048 --> 00:05:48,850
Fashion comes back around.

105
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:51,518
My aunt used to wear that.

106
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:54,588
Say bye bye.

107
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:57,025
You know how to wave goodbye. Bye bye.

108
00:05:57,025 --> 00:05:59,093
- Bye bye. / - Seojun, say bye.

109
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:01,328
See you.

110
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:03,698
Let's sleep!

111
00:06:03,698 --> 00:06:05,266
Seojun, let's get some sleep.

112
00:06:08,603 --> 00:06:12,740
I can't believe I'm having a shower in the day.

113
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:25,286
There are so many things.

114
00:06:26,012 --> 00:06:28,049
First, brunch on a fine day.

115
00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:29,434
Wearing sunglasses.

116
00:06:32,193 --> 00:06:34,161
And going to the amusement park.

117
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:35,696
Wearing sunglasses.

118
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:40,501
Seeing Sunghoon dress up so nicely...

119
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:42,170
I wondered how that was possible.

120
00:06:42,017 --> 00:06:43,885
But now I have that chance too.

121
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:45,440
Hollywood!

122
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:02,245
The sun's up!

123
00:07:03,358 --> 00:07:06,593
The sun is up!

124
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:08,696
The sun is up...

125
00:07:10,298 --> 00:07:11,900
It's up...

126
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:12,275
The sun is up!

127
00:07:13,968 --> 00:07:15,703
Sunghoon, you watching this?

128
00:07:18,064 --> 00:07:20,032
I can dress up too.

129
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:22,310
Are you watching from Tokyo?

130
00:07:43,531 --> 00:07:45,100
Your baby's really cute.

131
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:47,335
Say thank you.

132
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:48,903
Thank you

133
00:07:48,903 --> 00:07:49,970
Bye bye.

134
00:07:49,097 --> 00:07:50,065
Where's Seoeon?

135
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:54,075
I'm only taking care of one today.

136
00:07:54,075 --> 00:07:56,778
You really work hard on the show.

137
00:07:57,478 --> 00:07:58,613
Thank you!

138
00:07:58,613 --> 00:08:01,048
Bow. Thank you.

139
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:06,253
If you have a baby chair...

140
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:07,988
What's this? It's the menu.

141
00:08:08,523 --> 00:08:09,527
Menu!

142
00:08:18,007 --> 00:08:20,442
He's not normally like this.

143
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:24,838
Seojun, don't do that.

144
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:30,552
I was wondering why I couldn't see properly.

145
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,380
It was these sunglasses.

146
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:34,406
Oh, goodness me.

147
00:08:36,045 --> 00:08:37,480
Excuse me.

148
00:08:37,885 --> 00:08:41,221
What's the most popular salad these days?

149
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:42,790
- How's the avocado salad? / - It's good.

150
00:08:42,079 --> 00:08:44,147
It's good? Then I'll take that.

151
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,935
And an iced Americano.

152
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:49,930
- That'll do for now. / - Okay.

153
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:55,603
Excuse me.

154
00:08:55,603 --> 00:08:57,905
Do you have any fashion magazines

155
00:08:57,905 --> 00:08:59,340
or a newspaper?

156
00:08:59,034 --> 00:09:00,302
- Would you like to read it? / - Yes.

157
00:09:00,608 --> 00:09:03,076
- Just anything please. / - Just a minute.

158
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:10,318
I just hope a fashion magazine reporter

159
00:09:10,318 --> 00:09:12,420
happens to pass by and takes some photos.

160
00:09:12,042 --> 00:09:15,069
Lee Hwijae's 100 out 100, perfect fashion.

161
00:09:15,069 --> 00:09:16,404
It's New York!

162
00:09:19,036 --> 00:09:20,371
This is New York.

163
00:09:21,073 --> 00:09:24,120
Please make "Empire State of Mind"

164
00:09:25,002 --> 00:09:27,303
the background music.

165
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:32,506
Wonderful.

166
00:09:35,543 --> 00:09:36,676
Wonderful.

167
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,613
Wonderful tonight.

168
00:09:38,613 --> 00:09:40,248
Wonderful weather, I mean.

169
00:09:48,069 --> 00:09:50,537
This is close to what I pictured.

170
00:09:54,295 --> 00:09:56,230
How nice.

171
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:01,168
This is great.

172
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:13,615
Meanwhile...

173
00:10:13,615 --> 00:10:17,518
What's happening in Sarang's city of Tokyo?

174
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:58,426
Camera.

175
00:11:06,003 --> 00:11:08,090
Hello!

176
00:11:10,738 --> 00:11:11,706
Hello.

177
00:11:13,808 --> 00:11:14,975
Hello!

178
00:11:17,478 --> 00:11:18,380
Hello.

179
00:11:18,913 --> 00:11:20,915
Don't do that. Don't harass Buru.

180
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:22,716
Hello.

181
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:26,020
Hello.

182
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:36,230
The entire city has become frozen

183
00:11:36,023 --> 00:11:37,891
by the untimely snow storm.

184
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:41,115
Tokyo has become a winter kingdom.

185
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:46,606
It's become rain.

186
00:11:47,608 --> 00:11:49,685
It's become rain.

187
00:11:52,098 --> 00:11:53,833
It's raining right now.

188
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:02,056
Sunghoon.

189
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:06,073
The dog food is outside.

190
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:09,430
So give feed them this when it's time to eat.

191
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:14,301
And please take good care of Sarang again.

192
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:19,932
And you must clean. Clean!

193
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:23,411
And I know I'm repeating myself,

194
00:12:23,411 --> 00:12:26,613
but Sarang's getting very stubborn these days...

195
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:28,148
You go too easy on her

196
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:30,651
and do whatever she asks.

197
00:12:30,651 --> 00:12:33,755
She's becoming more and more spoilt.

198
00:12:33,755 --> 00:12:35,823
Since she understands everything we say now...

199
00:12:35,823 --> 00:12:39,840
- Isn't that right, Sarang? / - Yeah!

200
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:44,331
Really?

201
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:46,300
Sunghoon! Please listen!

202
00:12:46,003 --> 00:12:50,608
Please ask how she feels before you act.

203
00:12:50,905 --> 00:12:51,706
Really?

204
00:12:51,706 --> 00:12:52,706
It's cold!

205
00:12:52,706 --> 00:12:58,580
Sarang, do you want rice porridge?

206
00:12:58,058 --> 00:13:01,461
Or would you like rice and soup?

207
00:13:01,983 --> 00:13:03,651
Do you want rice balls?

208
00:13:07,021 --> 00:13:08,288
Do you want rice balls?

209
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,345
Rice balls please.

210
00:13:13,728 --> 00:13:15,896
Really? Really?

211
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:17,698
Really.

212
00:13:20,701 --> 00:13:21,803
Really.

213
00:13:22,736 --> 00:13:25,140
Here! Eat this. Is it good?

214
00:13:25,014 --> 00:13:26,615
You should eat too.

215
00:14:00,241 --> 00:14:02,776
Wait, don't feed her the rice over there!

216
00:14:02,776 --> 00:14:04,853
- She needs to eat. / - No, don't do that.

217
00:14:17,825 --> 00:14:19,393
Is she going to come back and eat here?

218
00:14:19,393 --> 00:14:21,830
Yes. If we sit down she'll come and eat.

219
00:14:23,565 --> 00:14:24,731
I'm pretty sure she won't sit back down here.

220
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:26,100
She will.

221
00:14:26,001 --> 00:14:29,028
You turned on the TV, right? That's why.

222
00:14:29,037 --> 00:14:30,505
She wanted to watch TV.

223
00:14:30,838 --> 00:14:32,906
That's why I asked you earlier.

224
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:36,911
You can't just do whatever she asks.

225
00:14:39,018 --> 00:14:42,454
Then you come and make her eat here.

226
00:14:42,616 --> 00:14:45,663
That's not it. She can eat first and watch later.

227
00:14:56,731 --> 00:14:57,898
I want to eat here.

228
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:00,801
Eat here first and watch later, Sarang.

229
00:15:01,077 --> 00:15:02,110
I want to eat here.

230
00:15:02,803 --> 00:15:05,806
Eat here first and watch later, Sarang.

231
00:15:05,806 --> 00:15:08,710
Let's eat first, Sarang.

232
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:20,187
Let's eat first then watch TV.

233
00:15:20,655 --> 00:15:22,390
I just need to eat this?

234
00:16:00,528 --> 00:16:03,831
I'm really sorry about this.

235
00:16:03,831 --> 00:16:06,400
But the babysitter can't make it today

236
00:16:06,004 --> 00:16:08,081
because of the snow storm.

237
00:16:09,017 --> 00:16:11,853
I'm really sorry about this.

238
00:16:12,006 --> 00:16:15,008
But do you think you could watch Yuto today?

239
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:17,025
Oh, Yuto?

240
00:16:21,095 --> 00:16:25,198
Yuto wants to meet Sarang.

241
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:28,130
Sarang, Yuto's coming!

242
00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:40,235
That means I have to watch two kids alone!

243
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:49,543
Sarang, Yuto's coming.

244
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:57,118
- Sarang, are you in a good mood? / - Yeah.

245
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:02,223
I really want to see him.

246
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:06,693
Sarang's starting to get excited.

247
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:09,530
You're okay to look after Yuto, right?

248
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:13,333
What do I do about lunch?

249
00:17:14,068 --> 00:17:16,070
How long do I have to watch him?

250
00:17:17,271 --> 00:17:20,775
Until 6:30 or 7 p.m.?

251
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:23,645
Until she finishes work.

252
00:17:23,645 --> 00:17:24,978
Just think it's till the evening.

253
00:17:24,978 --> 00:17:27,181
What do I do about their baths?

254
00:17:27,181 --> 00:17:28,315
Can they go in at the same time?

255
00:17:28,315 --> 00:17:31,018
You should ask and see if she wants you to.

256
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:33,855
I think bathing will be too hard.

257
00:17:33,855 --> 00:17:39,929
Sarang and Yuto have kissed before.

258
00:17:53,608 --> 00:17:58,880
What if Sarang and Yuto kiss again?

259
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:05,651
I'm going to kiss Yuto!

260
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:07,921
What did you say?

261
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:10,358
I'm going to kiss Yuto!

262
00:18:12,193 --> 00:18:14,228
She says she's going to kiss him.

263
00:18:18,004 --> 00:18:19,639
Oh, really?

264
00:18:20,035 --> 00:18:22,070
I've never seen that before.

265
00:18:23,571 --> 00:18:25,873
Totally!

266
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:32,280
Oh, my. Where is this? Korea?

267
00:18:32,098 --> 00:18:33,733
That's the first time I've seen that.

268
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:36,632
I'll have to stop them if they do it in front of me.

269
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:41,135
If he tries to kiss her in front of me, I'll stop him.

270
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:47,095
Why didn't the cameraman tell me this earlier?

271
00:18:48,863 --> 00:18:51,265
You want my headband. There you go.

272
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:04,245
You could simulate raising a son with him!

273
00:19:16,891 --> 00:19:17,858
Which chopsticks do you want to use?

274
00:19:17,858 --> 00:19:19,526
Mickey Mouse.

275
00:19:20,728 --> 00:19:22,263
<i>Mickey Mouse!</i>

276
00:19:22,863 --> 00:19:28,436
<i>Mickey Mouse!</i>

277
00:19:31,105 --> 00:19:32,773
This is that thing...

278
00:19:32,773 --> 00:19:35,776
What Junu's father used to do.

279
00:20:05,373 --> 00:20:08,041
Junu's really clever.

280
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:12,246
He read books from a very young age.

281
00:20:12,246 --> 00:20:16,250
And I don't think they let him watch much TV.

282
00:20:33,501 --> 00:20:38,840
"You're not allowed to eat that cake."

283
00:20:40,006 --> 00:20:42,443
Tinker Bell stopped him but Peter Pan didn't listen.

284
00:21:00,028 --> 00:21:01,195
Yuto!

285
00:21:07,168 --> 00:21:09,336
It's just the delivery man.

286
00:21:15,376 --> 00:21:16,376
It's Yuto, right?

287
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:18,780
It's not Yuto. It's the delivery man.

288
00:21:19,078 --> 00:21:20,779
Do you like Yuto?

289
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:23,250
- Do you like Yuto? / - Yes.

290
00:21:28,255 --> 00:21:29,256
Yuto!

291
00:21:30,825 --> 00:21:32,093
Mom, look at this.

292
00:21:32,093 --> 00:21:33,795
What is that?

293
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:41,068
Look, it's a huge booger!

294
00:21:50,045 --> 00:21:51,047
It's Yuto!

295
00:22:02,523 --> 00:22:03,925
Yuto!

296
00:22:05,016 --> 00:22:06,951
Yuto!

297
00:22:13,435 --> 00:22:15,403
She looks so happy.

298
00:22:15,403 --> 00:22:17,105
Yuto.

299
00:22:17,105 --> 00:22:20,108
- Do you like Yuto? / - Yes!

300
00:22:21,141 --> 00:22:22,676
Who do you like more? Daddy or Yuto?

301
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:23,878
Yuto!

302
00:22:28,716 --> 00:22:30,151
Who do you like more? Daddy or Yuto?

303
00:22:30,151 --> 00:22:31,318
Yuto!

304
00:22:32,092 --> 00:22:33,527
She answers so quickly.

305
00:23:49,163 --> 00:23:51,065
Haru, check this out.

306
00:23:51,065 --> 00:23:52,266
Look.

307
00:23:53,635 --> 00:23:55,103
Close your eyes.

308
00:23:55,103 --> 00:23:56,108
Keep them closed.

309
00:23:57,071 --> 00:24:03,678
<i>Abra...</i>

310
00:24:06,748 --> 00:24:08,516

00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:11,251
No, wait.

<i>Abracadabra. Ta-da!</i>

314
00:24:22,196 --> 00:24:24,031
- What is it? / - How did it get so big?

315
00:24:27,735 --> 00:24:29,136
Giraffe!

316
00:24:29,136 --> 00:24:30,905
Want me to make it small again?

317
00:24:31,605 --> 00:24:33,708
<i>Abra...</i>

318
00:24:38,078 --> 00:24:42,116
<i>- Cadabra. / - Abra...</i>

<i>Abracadabra. Ta-da!</i>

320
00:24:58,666 --> 00:25:00,368
Should we make it big again?

321
00:25:00,368 --> 00:25:01,736
- Again? / - Yeah.

322
00:25:01,736 --> 00:25:04,338

<i>Abracadabra. Ta-da!</i>

325
00:25:28,063 --> 00:25:29,831
What's for breakfast?

326
00:25:30,398 --> 00:25:32,566
Oh, wow. Pork belly?

327
00:25:32,566 --> 00:25:34,368
It's the shoulder meat that Haru likes.

328
00:25:34,368 --> 00:25:35,570
Pork shoulder?

329
00:25:36,771 --> 00:25:39,173
Haru, mom's making your favorite.

330
00:25:39,173 --> 00:25:40,908
Hurry up and cook already!

331
00:25:40,908 --> 00:25:43,711
Why didn't I press the button? I thought I did...

332
00:25:43,711 --> 00:25:45,513
Who are you talking to?

333
00:25:45,513 --> 00:25:47,348
I didn't press the cook button for the rice.

334
00:25:47,348 --> 00:25:48,983
Were you talking to the rice cooker?

335
00:25:49,683 --> 00:25:51,318
I was raging at the rice cooker.

336
00:25:52,062 --> 00:25:53,797
Nemo has big eyes.

337
00:25:54,355 --> 00:25:56,056
Do you have big or small eyes, Haru?

338
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:57,191
- Big eyes. / - Let's see.

339
00:25:57,191 --> 00:25:59,160
Open them real big.

340
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:00,451
As big as you can.

341
00:26:01,896 --> 00:26:03,030
What is that?

342
00:26:03,003 --> 00:26:03,871
Then what about mom?

343
00:26:03,898 --> 00:26:05,800
Let's make mom be the shark.

344
00:26:05,008 --> 00:26:07,276
No, they're scary.

345
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:10,105
That's why, because she's scary.

346
00:26:10,438 --> 00:26:12,806
Daddy's a little scared of mom.

347
00:26:16,021 --> 00:26:17,956
How am I scary?

348
00:26:20,115 --> 00:26:21,548
In a good way.

349
00:26:23,885 --> 00:26:25,120
Thank you for the meal.

350
00:26:25,012 --> 00:26:26,378
Let's dig in.

351
00:26:29,323 --> 00:26:31,458
This soup is so delicious.

352
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:35,496
Haru, this is what you call mom's bean paste stew.

353
00:26:35,496 --> 00:26:36,965
Eat up.

354
00:26:36,965 --> 00:26:37,898
Let's go!

355
00:26:37,898 --> 00:26:41,435
Rice gives you the energy to raise kids.

356
00:26:47,908 --> 00:26:49,876
That camera...

357
00:26:49,876 --> 00:26:52,680
It's shooting me on extreme close up.

358
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:53,603
I only realized now.

359
00:26:58,853 --> 00:27:01,555
You said yourself that you look like Kim Soohyun.

360
00:27:06,016 --> 00:27:08,819
Haru, does daddy look like Do Minjun?

361
00:27:11,465 --> 00:27:13,502
Will you be okay with daddy?

362
00:27:14,501 --> 00:27:16,103
Want to stay with mommy?

363
00:27:18,406 --> 00:27:20,375
Haru, what song do you want to listen to?

364
00:27:21,541 --> 00:27:22,776
"Let It Go."

365
00:27:22,776 --> 00:27:25,613
Aren't you sick of "Let It Go?"

366
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:04,216
Where?

367
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:05,553
You're asking where we are?

368
00:28:05,553 --> 00:28:07,255
It's a strawberry farm.

369
00:28:08,823 --> 00:28:10,391
Big and pretty strawberries

370
00:28:10,391 --> 00:28:12,826
that have ripened with the warmth of spring.

371
00:28:12,826 --> 00:28:14,863
Will Haru be able to take these strawberries

372
00:28:15,196 --> 00:28:16,931
safely home?

373
00:28:17,831 --> 00:28:20,068
The ones that have this green part

374
00:28:20,068 --> 00:28:23,115
pointing to the sky, are well-ripe.

375
00:28:23,538 --> 00:28:25,273
And this is how you pick them.

376
00:28:25,273 --> 00:28:28,308
You twist your wrist like this.

377
00:28:28,308 --> 00:28:32,146
As if you're waving. Then you can pick them easily.

378
00:28:32,146 --> 00:28:34,881
Okay, let's go in and pick some strawberries.

379
00:28:35,416 --> 00:28:38,051
Mom said to pick lots of strawberries.

380
00:28:38,051 --> 00:28:39,420
This isn't it.

381
00:28:41,823 --> 00:28:44,125
Here it is. Red one.

382
00:28:47,261 --> 00:28:49,363
Hello, strawberries.

383
00:28:51,098 --> 00:28:54,135
Can you get picked for me?

384
00:28:57,171 --> 00:28:58,706
I can't pick this one.

385
00:28:58,706 --> 00:29:01,713
You can't? You asked and they said no?

386
00:29:02,443 --> 00:29:05,646
Haru, there's a family of 5 red friends there.

387
00:29:08,983 --> 00:29:10,785
Hello.

388
00:29:12,086 --> 00:29:13,655
Can I pick you?

389
00:29:16,556 --> 00:29:18,793
Can I? There we go.

390
00:29:20,261 --> 00:29:21,728
Wow, that's pretty.

391
00:29:21,728 --> 00:29:23,765
A big strawberry!

392
00:29:23,765 --> 00:29:25,900
Big strawberry.

393
00:29:25,009 --> 00:29:27,612
- This one's really red. / - Let's say cheers.

394
00:29:29,503 --> 00:29:31,038
Cheers.

395
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:31,840
Big strawberry!

396
00:29:31,084 --> 00:29:32,685
Haru, big strawberry!

397
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:36,110
Can I pick you?

398
00:29:36,011 --> 00:29:37,112
"Yeah."

399
00:29:37,211 --> 00:29:38,278
It said yes.

400
00:29:38,946 --> 00:29:41,381
Did you hear it? Did you hear its voice?

401
00:29:42,883 --> 00:29:45,220
Can I eat you? "Yes!"

402
00:29:46,042 --> 00:29:47,677
They really talk!

403
00:29:48,055 --> 00:29:51,391
Was that the strawberry talking?

404
00:29:51,391 --> 00:29:52,126
Yes.

405
00:29:52,126 --> 00:29:53,093
Wow.

406
00:29:54,195 --> 00:29:56,230
The strawberries talk.

407
00:29:56,731 --> 00:29:57,965
Right?

408
00:29:58,007 --> 00:30:01,043
Haru, even just a few years ago...

409
00:30:01,736 --> 00:30:05,038
I never imagined I'd be picking strawberries like this.

410
00:30:05,873 --> 00:30:08,175
I get to do lots of fun things thanks to you.

411
00:30:09,011 --> 00:30:14,449
Haru and Hyejeong are like the spring to me.

412
00:30:15,048 --> 00:30:22,123
When I'm lonely and feel like I'm trapped in winter...

413
00:30:22,123 --> 00:30:24,758
Just looking at them makes it seem like it's spring,

414
00:30:24,758 --> 00:30:27,095
even if it's for an instant.

415
00:30:27,095 --> 00:30:28,896
That's what they're like to me.

416
00:30:28,896 --> 00:30:31,198
Strawberry, may I pick you?

417
00:30:31,198 --> 00:30:32,833
Can I eat you?

418
00:30:39,014 --> 00:30:39,023
Haru!

419
00:30:43,878 --> 00:30:46,113
There's a garden growing in your head.

420
00:30:47,481 --> 00:30:50,818
Bee, come have some honey.

421
00:30:50,818 --> 00:30:52,020
Haru, Haru!

422
00:30:52,002 --> 00:30:53,570
Don't call the bees.

423
00:30:54,155 --> 00:30:56,223
Daddy's scared of bees.

424
00:30:58,291 --> 00:31:00,298
Bee, eat this.

425
00:31:00,361 --> 00:31:01,863
- Hey. / - Haru!

426
00:31:01,863 --> 00:31:03,998
- Eat this. / - Haru, don't call the bees.

427
00:31:03,998 --> 00:31:06,166
Why not?

428
00:31:09,047 --> 00:31:10,515
- Don't call the bees. / - Why not?

429
00:31:10,938 --> 00:31:12,240
Did you call them?

430
00:31:13,575 --> 00:31:15,143
You called them, right?

431
00:31:15,143 --> 00:31:16,146
It's on me, right?

432
00:31:19,008 --> 00:31:21,509
- It's on me, right? / - Oh, let's go, daddy.

433
00:31:21,581 --> 00:31:23,283
- Did you call them? / - No.

434
00:31:23,283 --> 00:31:24,885
You called them, right?

435
00:31:24,885 --> 00:31:27,121
- It's on me, right? / - Oh, let's go, daddy.

436
00:31:27,121 --> 00:31:29,923
Daddy, let's get out of here.

437
00:31:29,923 --> 00:31:30,925
Okay...

438
00:31:31,458 --> 00:31:32,760
But you called the bee...

439
00:31:32,076 --> 00:31:34,153
Daddy! I said let's get out of here!

440
00:31:35,053 --> 00:31:36,754
- Okay! / - Hold me!

441
00:31:37,231 --> 00:31:38,866
I'm sorry.

442
00:31:38,866 --> 00:31:40,768
But you called the bee over.

443
00:31:41,701 --> 00:31:43,738
- Are you scared of bees? / - Yes.

444
00:31:44,071 --> 00:31:46,106
When I was sending Junu to school,

445
00:31:46,106 --> 00:31:49,343
I didn't really worry that much.

446
00:31:49,343 --> 00:31:50,945
But now that I'm sending Junseo to school...

447
00:31:50,945 --> 00:31:54,248
I'm pretty worried.

448
00:31:54,248 --> 00:31:55,816
He doesn't even know

449
00:31:55,816 --> 00:31:58,453
to raise his pants all the way up

450
00:31:58,453 --> 00:32:00,621
after going to the toilet.

451
00:32:02,723 --> 00:32:04,091
I'd like to send him to kindergarten

452
00:32:04,091 --> 00:32:05,826
for another year or so.

453
00:32:07,261 --> 00:32:08,963
- Junseo. / - Yeah?

454
00:32:08,963 --> 00:32:12,566
Since you're going to school now,

455
00:32:12,566 --> 00:32:14,623
you have to use these chopsticks.

456
00:32:15,136 --> 00:32:16,971
When you eat...

457
00:32:16,971 --> 00:32:19,988
Let's practice with this from today.

458
00:32:20,675 --> 00:32:21,508
Okay?

459
00:32:24,178 --> 00:32:25,413
Got it?

460
00:32:28,015 --> 00:32:30,418
Give me the training chopsticks first.

461
00:32:30,418 --> 00:32:31,451
Why?

462
00:32:32,053 --> 00:32:33,855
So you can get a feel for it?

463
00:32:34,188 --> 00:32:35,623
Get a good feel for it.

464
00:32:35,623 --> 00:32:38,225
Remember how to do it and try.

465
00:32:50,938 --> 00:32:52,573
You're going to match it to that?

466
00:33:05,072 --> 00:33:06,707
I can't do this.

467
00:33:07,355 --> 00:33:09,556
You can't give up after just one try.

468
00:33:09,556 --> 00:33:10,725
You have to keep trying.

469
00:33:10,725 --> 00:33:12,526
You can't use these chopsticks at school.

470
00:33:12,526 --> 00:33:13,861
That's embarrassing.

471
00:33:13,861 --> 00:33:16,898
Are you going to always give up at school?

472
00:33:17,231 --> 00:33:18,833
Junseo's good at it.

473
00:33:18,833 --> 00:33:22,670
He just has to fix this one thing.

474
00:33:22,067 --> 00:33:23,802
Junseo, watch this.

475
00:33:24,405 --> 00:33:25,973
Do it like this.

476
00:33:30,078 --> 00:33:32,013
It's hard to do it on the inside.

477
00:33:32,013 --> 00:33:33,715
That's the way.

478
00:33:37,251 --> 00:33:39,453
When school starts, dad will...

479
00:33:41,521 --> 00:33:43,056
To your mouth!

480
00:33:44,625 --> 00:33:45,926
To your mouth!

481
00:33:52,001 --> 00:33:53,702
You really are amazing!

482
00:33:55,103 --> 00:33:56,805
Try this one.

483
00:34:00,641 --> 00:34:01,375
Mom!

484
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:03,310
- Get a little piece of kimchi... / - Did you get it?

485
00:34:08,048 --> 00:34:09,183
Just a bit more.

486
00:34:33,024 --> 00:34:34,759
You really are amazing!

487
00:34:35,676 --> 00:34:37,145
Just what is going on here?

488
00:34:37,145 --> 00:34:39,646
He got the bean.

489
00:34:42,483 --> 00:34:45,320
He has to learn to tie his shoelaces.

490
00:34:45,032 --> 00:34:47,467
Junseo has to get his vaccinations today.

491
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:53,182
Practice your addition just a little more...

492
00:34:53,695 --> 00:34:56,630
Junseo, you're pretty good at addition now, right?

493
00:34:56,063 --> 00:34:57,298
- Are you good? / - Yeah.

494
00:34:57,865 --> 00:34:59,033
Show me.

495
00:35:01,701 --> 00:35:03,738
<i>1 plus 1 is cutie.</i>

496
00:35:05,906 --> 00:35:07,908
<i>1 plus 1 is cutie.</i>

497
00:35:13,681 --> 00:35:15,450
- Junseo. / - Yeah?

498
00:35:15,045 --> 00:35:16,846
Do some study with dad.

499
00:35:17,251 --> 00:35:18,820
<i>1 plus 1 is...</i>

500
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:20,450
Study with dad when I'm not here.

501
00:35:28,663 --> 00:35:31,331
5 plus 7 is?

502
00:35:48,015 --> 00:35:48,850
12.

503
00:35:48,085 --> 00:35:50,353
Wow, you're amazing!

504
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:52,115
You're good.

505
00:35:52,853 --> 00:35:55,956
I calculated it with my toes and fingers.

506
00:36:03,531 --> 00:36:05,266
I'm suffering here with study

507
00:36:05,266 --> 00:36:08,035
and Junu gets to read in peace.

508
00:36:08,035 --> 00:36:09,736
Junu did all this once too.

509
00:36:12,173 --> 00:36:14,008
Junu will teach you how to write

510
00:36:14,008 --> 00:36:16,310
grandma and grandpa's names.

511
00:36:16,031 --> 00:36:19,068
So he can write it out. Okay?

512
00:36:20,681 --> 00:36:22,350
Get to it then.

513
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:31,025
Go on and memorize this.

514
00:36:32,026 --> 00:36:34,094
This is grandpa's name on mom's side.

515
00:36:34,328 --> 00:36:36,030
Grandma's name on mom's side.

516
00:36:36,003 --> 00:36:37,671
Grandpa's name on dad's side.

517
00:36:37,698 --> 00:36:39,366
Grandma's name on dad's side.

518
00:36:39,766 --> 00:36:41,803
Gong Okja.

519
00:36:42,303 --> 00:36:44,471
Jang Anyeong.

520
00:36:44,471 --> 00:36:46,506
Yang Taekjo.

521
00:36:47,208 --> 00:36:49,343
Memorizing this is so much work.

522
00:36:53,113 --> 00:36:55,160
Jang Anyeong. Gong Okja.

523
00:36:55,583 --> 00:37:01,421
Yang Hyeonseong. Lee Unseon.

524
00:37:01,421 --> 00:37:02,090
Hey!

525
00:37:03,425 --> 00:37:04,158
Hey!

526
00:37:05,526 --> 00:37:08,261
Yang, dot, Taek, dot, Jo, dot.

527
00:37:08,261 --> 00:37:10,298
Jang. An. Yeong.

528
00:37:10,298 --> 00:37:13,166
You add "dot" after each character to show respect.

529
00:37:13,166 --> 00:37:14,368
Got that?

530
00:37:14,901 --> 00:37:15,970
Yeah...

531
00:37:18,094 --> 00:37:20,162
Think you're so good.

532
00:37:22,276 --> 00:37:25,313
Yang. Taek. Jo.

533
00:37:25,313 --> 00:37:28,315
Jang. An. Yeong.

534
00:37:28,315 --> 00:37:30,342
Gong. Ok...

535
00:37:31,585 --> 00:37:33,388
Grandpa's name on mom's side.

536
00:37:43,931 --> 00:37:45,933
How do you write Taek again?

537
00:37:50,605 --> 00:37:52,506
In 3 seconds...

538
00:38:01,715 --> 00:38:03,518
How do I?

539
00:38:05,753 --> 00:38:08,088
Taek! Taek! Taek! Taek!

540
00:38:09,059 --> 00:38:10,127
You don't know?

541
00:38:11,591 --> 00:38:12,526
No!

542
00:38:12,526 --> 00:38:14,428
Then memorize it again from the start.

543
00:38:24,405 --> 00:38:26,482
Yang. Taek. Jo.

544
00:38:27,175 --> 00:38:29,010
Lee. Eun...

545
00:38:30,445 --> 00:38:31,813
I've memorized it.

546
00:38:32,098 --> 00:38:34,301
What will you do if you get it wrong?

547
00:38:35,183 --> 00:38:37,185
What's your punishment?

548
00:38:37,185 --> 00:38:40,188
Why must there be a punishment?

549
00:38:45,006 --> 00:38:47,707
Why must you be like this?

550
00:38:48,663 --> 00:38:50,665
What did I do wrong?

551
00:38:50,665 --> 00:38:52,300
You're taking a test right now.

552
00:38:52,003 --> 00:38:53,871
To see if you've memorized it or not.

553
00:38:55,017 --> 00:38:56,020
My brother!

554
00:38:56,938 --> 00:38:58,171
He was like...

555
00:39:00,775 --> 00:39:02,376
He glared at me like this.

556
00:39:02,376 --> 00:39:03,711
He was totally...

557
00:39:05,113 --> 00:39:08,450
So annoying.

558
00:39:12,853 --> 00:39:14,055
I've finished.

559
00:39:24,531 --> 00:39:26,166
You got it all right.

560
00:39:26,166 --> 00:39:28,203
- Dad, he's memorized it all. / - Oh, really?

561
00:39:28,903 --> 00:39:30,438
Well done.

562
00:39:35,843 --> 00:39:37,278
They met some amazing actors

563
00:39:37,278 --> 00:39:39,180
as they followed dad to work.

564
00:39:39,018 --> 00:39:41,921
Reply Superman, Uncle Kim Sungkyun.

565
00:39:42,983 --> 00:39:44,518
Everything works out for him.

566
00:39:44,518 --> 00:39:46,721
Uncle Cho Jinwoong who knows what's up.

567
00:39:46,721 --> 00:39:47,755
And...

568
00:39:49,023 --> 00:39:51,191
The king of charisma that's

569
00:39:51,191 --> 00:39:52,193
hard to see on TV.

570
00:39:52,193 --> 00:39:53,695
Uncle Kim Yunseok.

571
00:39:53,695 --> 00:39:55,063
You've grown a lot.

572
00:39:56,363 --> 00:39:58,766
Is it more fun to hang out with dad than mom?

573
00:40:00,033 --> 00:40:01,936
What did you say?

574
00:40:02,703 --> 00:40:04,505
A fun time with three uncles that

575
00:40:04,505 --> 00:40:07,208
aren't easy to meet.

576
00:40:07,208 --> 00:40:08,476
Don't miss out.

577
00:40:10,001 --> 00:40:11,904
Yuto's coming, Sarang!

578
00:40:20,221 --> 00:40:21,225
Who do you like better? Dad or Yuto?

579
00:40:21,621 --> 00:40:23,658
Yuto!

580
00:40:26,226 --> 00:40:30,631
I'm going to kiss Yuto!

581
00:40:30,631 --> 00:40:31,733
Totally!

582
00:40:32,366 --> 00:40:34,501
I'll have to stop them if they do it in front of me.

583
00:40:43,445 --> 00:40:44,978
Yuto is here!

584
00:40:46,213 --> 00:40:47,248
Yuto.

585
00:41:08,335 --> 00:41:09,270
Sarang!

586
00:41:10,171 --> 00:41:11,171
Sarang!

587
00:41:14,975 --> 00:41:16,543
Thank... Huh?

588
00:41:17,478 --> 00:41:19,213
She's been going on about

589
00:41:19,213 --> 00:41:21,081
how much she wants to see him...

590
00:41:29,423 --> 00:41:31,525
Look, it's Yuto!

591
00:41:33,728 --> 00:41:36,130
Leave the umbrella.

592
00:41:53,213 --> 00:41:55,300
Yuto, you look cool.

593
00:42:01,088 --> 00:42:02,656
Check this out!

594
00:42:24,978 --> 00:42:28,450
Wow, that's cute. What is this castle?

595
00:42:34,988 --> 00:42:38,660
Yuto, what is this?

596
00:42:50,871 --> 00:42:53,608
Yuto's been stressing about

597
00:42:53,608 --> 00:42:56,576
whether to hug Sarang or kiss her.

598
00:42:57,845 --> 00:42:59,980
Really? This is dangerous.

599
00:42:59,098 --> 00:43:01,334
Sarang said she'd kiss him too.

600
00:43:02,216 --> 00:43:04,418
Sarang, do you like this?

601
00:43:04,418 --> 00:43:05,886
This is it.

602
00:43:07,388 --> 00:43:09,490
Did Sarang turn on the music?

603
00:43:09,049 --> 00:43:12,085
She wanted to play it for Sarang

604
00:43:12,526 --> 00:43:14,061
and said, "This is it."

605
00:43:20,635 --> 00:43:22,970
Say, "Can I borrow it please?"

606
00:43:22,097 --> 00:43:23,865
Can I borrow it?

607
00:43:43,791 --> 00:43:46,226
I think you'll have it easy today, Sunghoon.

608
00:43:46,226 --> 00:43:51,565
You might get lonely if they play by themselves.

609
00:43:51,565 --> 00:43:53,100
If they play by themselves.

610
00:45:19,053 --> 00:45:21,255
I want to eat this.

611
00:45:47,515 --> 00:45:49,572
Please open this. Yuto can't do it.

612
00:45:52,553 --> 00:45:55,356
Give it to Yuto.

613
00:46:12,873 --> 00:46:14,541
What are you doing, Yuto?

614
00:46:23,116 --> 00:46:24,385
Don't give that to Sarang.

615
00:46:24,385 --> 00:46:26,353
That was in your mouth.

616
00:46:54,515 --> 00:46:57,351
What time did Yuto have breakfast?

617
00:46:57,351 --> 00:47:00,488
I think around 8 o'clock.

618
00:47:10,198 --> 00:47:11,866
You're not going to eat this?

619
00:47:29,483 --> 00:47:32,186
Move. Yuto can't see.

620
00:47:42,073 --> 00:47:44,509
Look!

621
00:47:58,413 --> 00:47:59,415
Watch this.

622
00:48:03,025 --> 00:48:05,828
Look! Sarang's on TV.

623
00:48:10,858 --> 00:48:12,260
What's going on?

624
00:49:18,091 --> 00:49:21,863
She normally hates brushing her teeth.

625
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:27,238
She's not coming out of the bathroom.

626
00:49:36,276 --> 00:49:38,145
I want to have a bath.

627
00:49:38,145 --> 00:49:40,232
What? A bath?

628
00:49:41,015 --> 00:49:42,450
Are you going to bath?

629
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:43,546
Let's do it later.

630
00:49:43,951 --> 00:49:45,753
Will you have a bath together?

631
00:49:45,753 --> 00:49:47,021
I will.

632
00:49:49,056 --> 00:49:50,891
Should we do it after we go outside?

633
00:49:52,593 --> 00:49:54,228
We'll do it later.

634
00:50:02,037 --> 00:50:03,372
I want to bath.

635
00:50:04,271 --> 00:50:06,473
I said I want to bath.

636
00:50:06,473 --> 00:50:08,108
Later.

637
00:50:12,613 --> 00:50:15,716
I've put rice balls in your bags.

638
00:50:16,718 --> 00:50:20,221
Will we bath after we eat rice balls?

639
00:50:20,788 --> 00:50:22,556
Okay, let's bath after eating rice balls.

640
00:50:22,556 --> 00:50:24,591
No, we'll bath after we go out.

641
00:50:24,591 --> 00:50:26,426
He keeps going on about bathing.

642
00:50:27,161 --> 00:50:29,663
They want to bath together.

643
00:50:29,663 --> 00:50:32,600
Sunghoon, make sure you bath them both.

644
00:50:39,773 --> 00:50:41,275
Bye bye.

645
00:50:59,126 --> 00:51:01,561
Let's go eat.

646
00:51:02,363 --> 00:51:04,965
We're here to have lunch.

647
00:51:09,027 --> 00:51:10,895
Yuto, what do you want to eat?

648
00:51:12,406 --> 00:51:13,908
This.

649
00:51:39,933 --> 00:51:43,371
I'll call the goblin.

650
00:51:43,371 --> 00:51:44,374
No.

651
00:51:46,106 --> 00:51:49,143
I want to dance to heavy beats.

652
00:51:49,476 --> 00:51:51,311
You want to dance?

653
00:52:19,673 --> 00:52:20,375
One more time.

654
00:52:20,375 --> 00:52:21,378
After we eat.

655
00:52:21,675 --> 00:52:23,276
Let's do it after we eat.

656
00:52:26,058 --> 00:52:27,493
The goblin is coming.

657
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:38,076
Sarang, it's scary. Will you be okay?

658
00:52:40,026 --> 00:52:43,130
Hello!

659
00:52:46,968 --> 00:52:47,970
I'm scared.

660
00:52:48,168 --> 00:52:50,255
Are they being naughty again?

661
00:52:51,671 --> 00:52:53,040
I'm scared.

662
00:52:53,004 --> 00:52:55,091
See? Make sure you behave.

663
00:53:03,385 --> 00:53:05,420
Yuto and Sarang are behaving now.

664
00:53:05,042 --> 00:53:07,143
Okay, talk to you later.

665
00:53:07,521 --> 00:53:11,625
It's done. It's okay.

666
00:53:12,326 --> 00:53:14,495
It's okay now.

667
00:53:15,063 --> 00:53:16,931
You're alright.

668
00:53:16,931 --> 00:53:18,766
Sarang, it's okay now.

669
00:53:18,766 --> 00:53:20,635
- Sit down. / - Sarang, I'm scared.

670
00:53:20,635 --> 00:53:22,070
It's scary.

671
00:53:25,573 --> 00:53:26,975
Here are your toys.

672
00:53:30,911 --> 00:53:32,213
Wow!

673
00:53:33,448 --> 00:53:35,816
- Open this. / - Just one.

674
00:53:44,991 --> 00:53:45,826
Oh, gosh.

675
00:53:46,493 --> 00:53:47,928
- Oh, gosh. / - Oh, gosh...

676
00:53:48,496 --> 00:53:49,863
- Oh, gosh. / - Oh, gosh...

677
00:53:50,565 --> 00:53:52,400
I'm dying with you two.

678
00:53:58,473 --> 00:53:59,840
That hurts, right?

679
00:54:01,075 --> 00:54:02,143
Come here.

680
00:54:03,711 --> 00:54:04,778
Oh, gosh.

681
00:54:04,778 --> 00:54:05,880
It hurts!

682
00:54:05,088 --> 00:54:06,489
Come over here.

683
00:54:09,116 --> 00:54:11,183
That's because you were being greedy.

684
00:54:11,786 --> 00:54:12,788
Come here.

685
00:54:17,658 --> 00:54:18,526
Come here.

686
00:54:18,526 --> 00:54:19,793
Sarang, come here.

687
00:54:19,793 --> 00:54:21,328
Come over here.

688
00:54:38,713 --> 00:54:41,048
Where does it hurt?

689
00:54:45,286 --> 00:54:46,290
Just a wait a bit.

690
00:54:46,686 --> 00:54:48,321
Sarang, here!

691
00:54:53,795 --> 00:54:55,330
It's a present.

692
00:55:10,511 --> 00:55:11,980
This is great.

693
00:55:23,825 --> 00:55:25,760
Very good. Is it tasty?

694
00:55:45,746 --> 00:55:47,281
Open wide.

695
00:56:05,566 --> 00:56:07,035
Sarang, you have some too.

696
00:56:24,551 --> 00:56:26,588
Is it good? Oh, gosh.

697
00:56:54,648 --> 00:56:55,950
Oh, Yuto.

698
00:57:15,057 --> 00:57:17,125
You ate it all.

699
00:57:17,638 --> 00:57:19,673
Look how full you are.

700
00:57:28,348 --> 00:57:31,451
1, 2...

701
00:57:39,726 --> 00:57:41,763
1, 2...

702
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:16,634
Want to kiss?

703
00:58:22,436 --> 00:58:23,370
Want to kiss?

704
00:58:23,037 --> 00:58:24,405
No kissing allowed.

705
00:58:25,773 --> 00:58:28,041
Later.

706
00:58:33,346 --> 00:58:35,048
I want to dance.

707
00:58:37,251 --> 00:58:38,720
Stand up please.

708
00:59:37,478 --> 00:59:39,113
She's so clueless about how much

709
00:59:39,113 --> 00:59:40,548
her daddy's burning up inside.

710
00:59:40,548 --> 00:59:43,555
Sarang's busy on her date with Yuto.

711
00:59:45,153 --> 00:59:46,286
However...

712
00:59:46,286 --> 00:59:49,023
Who said that love is like delicate glass?

713
00:59:49,023 --> 00:59:50,158
Sarang!

714
01:00:33,535 --> 01:00:34,401
That's Yuto's.

715
01:00:34,401 --> 01:00:36,170
See?

716
01:01:30,991 --> 01:01:32,926
Meanwhile, Haru's immersed in the sweetness

717
01:01:32,926 --> 01:01:35,730
of the strawberries she picked herself.

718
01:01:36,196 --> 01:01:37,231
Delicious.

719
01:01:37,231 --> 01:01:38,500
Are they good?

720
01:01:39,733 --> 01:01:41,468
You think they're good too, right?

721
01:01:41,468 --> 01:01:42,703
They're good.

722
01:01:51,511 --> 01:01:53,113
You put these gloves on...

723
01:01:53,113 --> 01:01:57,218
And we're going to mush them together like this.

724
01:01:57,218 --> 01:01:58,853
- There. / - There we go.

725
01:01:59,386 --> 01:02:00,321
Watch this.

726
01:02:00,321 --> 01:02:02,123
Come and do it with me.

727
01:02:02,099 --> 01:02:03,800
Do it like this. Watch.

728
01:02:04,691 --> 01:02:05,793
Like this.

729
01:02:05,793 --> 01:02:08,820
If we do this then mom can't have any.

730
01:02:09,063 --> 01:02:11,298
We're going to take those for mom to have.

731
01:02:11,298 --> 01:02:13,433
And these are for making strawberry jam.

732
01:02:13,433 --> 01:02:16,570
Then I'll give mom this strawberry jam.

733
01:02:18,606 --> 01:02:20,141
Haru, do it like this.

734
01:02:20,141 --> 01:02:22,676
Like this, with both hands. Squeeze them like this.

735
01:02:23,545 --> 01:02:24,411
That's the way.

736
01:02:24,411 --> 01:02:30,425
Taekwondo!

737
01:02:30,551 --> 01:02:31,485
Finished.

738
01:02:31,485 --> 01:02:32,686
I'll do it.

739
01:02:32,686 --> 01:02:34,621
- You'll do it? / - Yes.

740
01:02:34,621 --> 01:02:37,558
Since the fire is on, is this hot or cold?

741
01:02:37,558 --> 01:02:38,460
- Hot. / - Right?

742
01:02:38,046 --> 01:02:39,512
- So make sure you don't touch. / - Okay.

743
01:02:39,926 --> 01:02:41,963
- Be careful. / - You can stir it, Haru.

744
01:02:42,063 --> 01:02:43,998
What is this black stuff?

745
01:02:44,565 --> 01:02:46,333
That's sugar.

746
01:02:46,333 --> 01:02:47,668
Stir well.

747
01:02:49,036 --> 01:02:50,871
Is it black sugar?

748
01:02:54,341 --> 01:02:57,478
Haru, should I buy us something to drink.

749
01:02:58,813 --> 01:02:59,880
No thanks.

750
01:03:00,581 --> 01:03:02,816
There's the camera. Hello, camera.

751
01:03:05,085 --> 01:03:06,486
You try.

752
01:03:06,486 --> 01:03:08,590
You want me to do it? Okay, which camera?

753
01:03:08,059 --> 01:03:08,992
The one on the ground?

754
01:03:09,523 --> 01:03:11,391
- Yeah. / - Okay. 1, 2, 3.

755
01:03:12,526 --> 01:03:13,761
There we go.

756
01:03:15,095 --> 01:03:16,998
Haru, let's do one for the cameraman.

757
01:03:17,531 --> 01:03:19,566
1, 2... What is that?

758
01:03:30,945 --> 01:03:32,746
Catch my kiss.

759
01:03:36,716 --> 01:03:38,385
Haru, I'm going to throw it high.

760
01:03:38,385 --> 01:03:39,986
This kiss is going high.

761
01:03:42,223 --> 01:03:43,991
You're good at eating kisses.

762
01:03:55,087 --> 01:03:57,455
Haru, let's come with our friends next time.

763
01:03:58,238 --> 01:04:00,475
It looks nice to see them all together like that.

764
01:04:03,243 --> 01:04:04,745
Haru, come here.

765
01:04:04,745 --> 01:04:05,946
Come over here.

766
01:04:06,746 --> 01:04:09,283
You have to scoop this and put it in here.

767
01:04:10,951 --> 01:04:11,886
Careful.

768
01:04:15,088 --> 01:04:16,056
That's the way.

769
01:04:22,063 --> 01:04:23,231
It's a horse.

770
01:04:25,433 --> 01:04:27,201
Where is it?

771
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:33,769
Look at its hair.

772
01:04:34,075 --> 01:04:36,410
It looks like when I wake up in the morning, huh?

773
01:04:36,041 --> 01:04:37,842
There are geese.

774
01:04:38,211 --> 01:04:40,815
We have geese and turkeys.

775
01:04:46,012 --> 01:04:48,049
You keep them with the goats?

776
01:04:48,049 --> 01:04:51,452
They don't know where to pee and poop.

777
01:04:51,893 --> 01:04:54,528
- That's why we put them in there. / - Wait...

778
01:04:54,528 --> 01:04:56,530
Haru loves donkeys.

779
01:04:57,998 --> 01:04:59,533
Feed him.

780
01:05:00,301 --> 01:05:01,903
Here, baby.

781
01:05:01,903 --> 01:05:04,805
He looks just like the donkey we have at home, right?

782
01:05:04,805 --> 01:05:05,906
Right.

783
01:05:07,808 --> 01:05:09,276
Give him some bread.

784
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:24,387
She must be hungry.

785
01:05:25,226 --> 01:05:27,861
She must be hungry.

786
01:05:28,395 --> 01:05:30,698
Doggy! Doggy!

787
01:05:31,933 --> 01:05:34,235
Can't you help me out?

788
01:05:43,076 --> 01:05:44,378
I'll do it.

789
01:05:53,002 --> 01:05:54,937
I can hold it too.

790
01:05:58,793 --> 01:06:00,495
Haru, where are you taking him?

791
01:06:00,495 --> 01:06:01,361
Haru!

792
01:06:01,361 --> 01:06:03,330
Should we go on the swing?

793
01:06:04,065 --> 01:06:05,433
Say baa.

794
01:06:05,966 --> 01:06:07,168
Goat?

795
01:06:08,401 --> 01:06:09,970
Should we put him on the swing?

796
01:06:09,097 --> 01:06:10,265
No...

797
01:06:11,138 --> 01:06:13,140
I'll hold him.

798
01:06:19,713 --> 01:06:21,648
You can't poop here.

799
01:06:21,648 --> 01:06:24,251
You'll get my pants dirty.

800
01:06:31,025 --> 01:06:33,293
She seems so at home with the puppy.

801
01:06:34,495 --> 01:06:37,131
That dog must like her. He's just sitting still.

802
01:06:37,131 --> 01:06:38,633
Haru, Haru!

803
01:06:46,506 --> 01:06:47,875
Doesn't she look like a kid

804
01:06:47,875 --> 01:06:49,743
that's lived here for like 10 years?

805
01:06:50,445 --> 01:06:53,046
She seems to fit in well.

806
01:06:55,065 --> 01:06:56,300
Can I sit here?

807
01:06:59,686 --> 01:07:00,621
So cute.

808
01:07:00,621 --> 01:07:01,823
What's his name?

809
01:07:01,823 --> 01:07:03,658
- Snowball. / - Snowball?

810
01:07:03,658 --> 01:07:04,662
Is that his name?

811
01:07:05,058 --> 01:07:05,860
Yes.

812
01:07:05,086 --> 01:07:09,222
But that black one over there...

813
01:07:09,996 --> 01:07:11,665
That's his mother!

814
01:07:11,665 --> 01:07:13,133
- Really? / - Yes.

815
01:07:13,635 --> 01:07:15,136
It's strange.

816
01:07:15,136 --> 01:07:17,371
But they're totally different colors.

817
01:07:20,073 --> 01:07:22,010
Haru! Haru!

818
01:07:31,751 --> 01:07:33,286
You're like a dog.

819
01:07:34,788 --> 01:07:36,123
I am, right?

820
01:07:37,325 --> 01:07:39,760
Haru, Snowball doesn't look too happy.

821
01:07:43,296 --> 01:07:45,433
But they're totally different colors.

822
01:07:46,433 --> 01:07:48,401
Hold him like this.

823
01:07:48,936 --> 01:07:49,903
That's it.

824
01:07:55,061 --> 01:07:56,062
Rooster.

825
01:07:56,071 --> 01:07:58,078
She really likes that dog.

826
01:07:58,078 --> 01:08:00,813
- Check out this puppy. / - Haru, you can take a puppy.

827
01:08:01,515 --> 01:08:02,916
No, it's alright.

828
01:08:03,551 --> 01:08:06,586
The grandpa next door won't like it.

829
01:08:07,955 --> 01:08:09,990
I want to take him.

830
01:08:09,099 --> 01:08:10,334
- Okay, take him. / - No, no.

831
01:08:11,225 --> 01:08:12,093
Haru!

832
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:16,263
Haru, we sent off the dog we had at home.

833
01:08:16,263 --> 01:08:17,498
You can take good care of him, right?

834
01:08:17,498 --> 01:08:18,431
Yes!

835
01:08:18,431 --> 01:08:19,666
Okay then.

836
01:08:23,027 --> 01:08:23,828
Haru...

837
01:08:24,071 --> 01:08:26,573
Let's go and get our strawberry jam.

838
01:08:26,573 --> 01:08:27,508
With him?

839
01:08:27,508 --> 01:08:29,143
- Snowball? / - Yes.

840
01:08:29,143 --> 01:08:30,578
Haru...

841
01:08:31,445 --> 01:08:33,548
We had to give away our other dog...

842
01:08:33,548 --> 01:08:34,681
No!

843
01:08:34,681 --> 01:08:37,728
Haru, his parents will cry if we take him.

844
01:08:38,151 --> 01:08:39,086
They won't.

845
01:08:39,086 --> 01:08:41,088
Let's ask Snowball's family.

846
01:08:41,088 --> 01:08:43,175
Mommy, can we take him?

847
01:08:43,958 --> 01:08:45,025
No!

848
01:08:45,993 --> 01:08:47,261
No!

849
01:08:47,261 --> 01:08:48,930
Yes!

850
01:08:48,093 --> 01:08:49,594
She said no.

851
01:08:50,431 --> 01:08:52,200
No, she said yes.

852
01:08:52,002 --> 01:08:55,238
Haru, he has to live with his family.

853
01:08:55,436 --> 01:08:59,740
It's okay to take fish and bugs home...

854
01:08:59,074 --> 01:09:02,310
But we're not in the position to take dogs home.

855
01:09:06,815 --> 01:09:07,748
Let's do this then.

856
01:09:07,748 --> 01:09:09,216
You can live here.

857
01:09:09,816 --> 01:09:12,753
Okay? You live here with Snowball.

858
01:09:12,753 --> 01:09:14,555
I'll go home.

859
01:09:15,079 --> 01:09:16,980
Do you want to live here with Snowball?

860
01:09:27,301 --> 01:09:29,103
Let's say bye.

861
01:09:29,636 --> 01:09:31,271
Goodbye, Snowball.

862
01:09:37,811 --> 01:09:40,868
He likes you because you were good to him.

863
01:09:56,798 --> 01:09:57,565
Bye!

864
01:09:58,031 --> 01:09:59,233
Bye.

865
01:09:59,733 --> 01:10:01,790
It was winter in my heart for a very long time.

866
01:10:02,303 --> 01:10:07,041
There was a time I just sat in my room and cried.

867
01:10:07,041 --> 01:10:09,876
I was crying and Haru came in...

868
01:10:09,876 --> 01:10:11,903
"Daddy, why are you crying?"

869
01:10:12,913 --> 01:10:16,250
She wipes my tears for me too.

870
01:10:16,025 --> 01:10:17,393
It's really fascinating.

871
01:10:17,618 --> 01:10:21,721
To have such a beautiful and cute friend

872
01:10:21,721 --> 01:10:25,025
that looks out for me...

873
01:10:25,025 --> 01:10:28,032
I think to myself that I have no reason to be sad.

874
01:10:29,796 --> 01:10:32,133
After enjoying the Hollywood lunch of his dreams

875
01:10:32,133 --> 01:10:33,535
with Seojun...

876
01:10:33,535 --> 01:10:35,570
Hwijae's returned home.

877
01:10:35,057 --> 01:10:37,525
What's he planning to do now?

878
01:10:42,011 --> 01:10:44,446
He's so good by himself.

879
01:10:47,215 --> 01:10:49,150
Seojun, you like baths.

880
01:10:56,069 --> 01:10:57,972
Is this for 10 babies?

881
01:10:58,926 --> 01:11:00,628
You can't come in now.

882
01:11:00,628 --> 01:11:01,761
But you can look.

883
01:11:05,065 --> 01:11:06,801
Do I fill the whole thing?

884
01:11:12,373 --> 01:11:13,575
Seojun, you try.

885
01:11:16,543 --> 01:11:18,646
Push it forward. That's the way.

886
01:11:47,308 --> 01:11:49,710
So it's supposed to rise up like this.

887
01:11:49,071 --> 01:11:50,306
Oh, my head.

888
01:11:57,551 --> 01:11:57,559
Hello?

889
01:11:58,351 --> 01:11:59,653
It's Hwijae.

890
01:12:00,086 --> 01:12:01,455
Hi, Hwijae.

891
01:12:01,455 --> 01:12:02,423
Are you home?

892
01:12:03,123 --> 01:12:04,025
Yes, I'm home.

893
01:12:04,025 --> 01:12:07,062
Can you come over for just a sec?

894
01:12:08,295 --> 01:12:09,363
Where? Are you home?

895
01:12:09,363 --> 01:12:10,698
Yes, I'm home.

896
01:12:10,698 --> 01:12:12,866
- Okay then. / - Okay.

897
01:12:19,074 --> 01:12:20,675
Seojun, let's open the door.

898
01:12:21,341 --> 01:12:23,210
You can do it.

899
01:12:24,911 --> 01:12:26,146
Open the door.

900
01:12:38,291 --> 01:12:39,326
Kang In!

901
01:12:40,395 --> 01:12:41,461
Heechul!

902
01:12:44,165 --> 01:12:45,400
Hello, baby!

903
01:12:45,833 --> 01:12:46,868
Hello!

904
01:12:48,268 --> 01:12:49,603
Hi, Seojun.

905
01:12:51,305 --> 01:12:53,040
Hi, it's Uncle Kang In.

906
01:12:53,541 --> 01:12:55,210
Let's see if he goes to Heechul.

907
01:12:56,845 --> 01:12:58,411
Come to me.

908
01:12:59,946 --> 01:13:00,881
Come on.

909
01:13:00,881 --> 01:13:02,716
He's shy.

910
01:13:03,083 --> 01:13:06,320
Hey, blow some air into this.

911
01:13:07,921 --> 01:13:10,090
Shouldn't you do that?

912
01:13:10,009 --> 01:13:11,812
We have to fill this with water.

913
01:13:11,893 --> 01:13:14,295
- You can do it. / - I haven't done this in a while.

914
01:13:14,295 --> 01:13:16,563
You have to blow well and make it really tight.

915
01:13:16,563 --> 01:13:18,580
That'll make sure the water doesn't leak.

916
01:13:20,066 --> 01:13:21,401
Come to me.

917
01:13:21,401 --> 01:13:22,070
It's Seojun.

918
01:13:22,007 --> 01:13:24,175
Seojun, let's play with uncle.

919
01:13:24,838 --> 01:13:26,373
Hello, Seojun.

920
01:13:26,875 --> 01:13:28,443
Sorry for making you do that, Heechul

921
01:13:28,443 --> 01:13:29,410
It's me.

922
01:13:29,041 --> 01:13:30,709
- It can't be helped. / - Want to go to dad?

923
01:13:31,078 --> 01:13:31,946
I'm too tired.

924
01:13:31,946 --> 01:13:32,947
To daddy?

925
01:13:34,248 --> 01:13:36,216
Seojun, these uncles...

926
01:13:36,216 --> 01:13:37,985
They're world stars.

927
01:13:37,985 --> 01:13:40,053
Hey, give him some of your energy.

928
01:13:41,088 --> 01:13:42,190
Take my energy.

929
01:13:43,256 --> 01:13:45,360
- Okay... / - Just hold him.

930
01:13:45,086 --> 01:13:46,154
Seojun...

931
01:13:47,428 --> 01:13:48,195
Seojun!

932
01:13:48,195 --> 01:13:50,096
You're making me do this...

933
01:13:51,431 --> 01:13:52,566
- Good work, Heechul. / - You need to blow more.

934
01:13:52,566 --> 01:13:53,400
Heechul!

935
01:13:54,335 --> 01:13:55,903
You can use this.

936
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:02,843
Yeah, use the pump.

937
01:14:06,746 --> 01:14:07,881
I'm so dizzy.

938
01:14:09,083 --> 01:14:10,818
- I'm dizzy. / - Heechul, give him a hug.

939
01:14:10,818 --> 01:14:12,820
- Good boy. / - Give him your energy.

940
01:14:12,082 --> 01:14:13,550
Seojun, these are world stars.

941
01:14:14,288 --> 01:14:16,365
You need to get energized by them.

942
01:14:20,795 --> 01:14:21,863
Sorry.

943
01:14:21,863 --> 01:14:24,065
We haven't seen you in a while.

944
01:14:24,665 --> 01:14:26,700
- We have the next mission. / - Okay.

945
01:14:27,435 --> 01:14:30,036
Heechul can look after the baby...

946
01:14:30,036 --> 01:14:32,373
- He can walk, right? / - No, not yet.

947
01:14:32,373 --> 01:14:34,308
I think he'll like you, Heechul,

948
01:14:34,308 --> 01:14:36,110
if you play with his toys.

949
01:14:38,111 --> 01:14:39,546
- Come to me. / - Kang In.

950
01:14:39,098 --> 01:14:40,366
- Kang In! / - Yes.

951
01:14:41,248 --> 01:14:42,683
Come here.

952
01:14:42,683 --> 01:14:44,418
- Don't worry about the baby. / - Okay.

953
01:14:45,022 --> 01:14:46,623
Do you have to bathe the baby?

954
01:14:46,821 --> 01:14:48,288
Bubble bath.

955
01:14:48,288 --> 01:14:51,025
- You're going to fill the pool? / - Yeah.

956
01:14:53,995 --> 01:14:56,696
Wait. This won't leak, right?

957
01:14:56,696 --> 01:14:58,098
It can't leak.

958
01:14:59,266 --> 01:15:00,835
So cute.

959
01:15:01,101 --> 01:15:02,536
Want to go for a swim?

960
01:15:04,071 --> 01:15:06,140
"I want to swim."

961
01:15:06,014 --> 01:15:07,282
Seojun...

962
01:15:08,175 --> 01:15:10,311
"Fill it up with water quick."

963
01:15:13,046 --> 01:15:14,348
Heechul, it's not leaking, right?

964
01:15:14,348 --> 01:15:15,183
- No. / - No.

965
01:15:15,183 --> 01:15:16,416
Take a look.

966
01:15:16,416 --> 01:15:18,318
He's so cute.

967
01:15:19,053 --> 01:15:19,920
I love babies...

968
01:15:19,092 --> 01:15:20,927
When will we fill all of this?

969
01:15:22,456 --> 01:15:23,958
Don't you have a hose?

970
01:15:23,958 --> 01:15:25,560
Of course not. Who has a hose inside the house?

971
01:15:25,056 --> 01:15:26,324
Want to swim?

972
01:15:27,895 --> 01:15:29,396
Do you want to swim?

973
01:15:29,396 --> 01:15:32,403
How cute will they be when I have babies too?

974
01:15:32,466 --> 01:15:33,535
Right?

975
01:15:34,368 --> 01:15:36,871
How come he's not crying with you?

976
01:15:36,871 --> 01:15:39,940
- You know I used to be scared of kids? / - Yeah.

977
01:15:39,094 --> 01:15:41,230
But I love babies now.

978
01:15:44,545 --> 01:15:45,380
Hello!

979
01:15:45,946 --> 01:15:47,515
That's fascinating.

980
01:15:47,515 --> 01:15:49,716
- What's your name? / - He's really behaving.

981
01:15:49,716 --> 01:15:52,053
That's not good for your body.

982
01:15:55,049 --> 01:15:56,884
Seojun, just wait.

983
01:15:57,991 --> 01:16:00,895
Kang In's been tricked.

984
01:16:01,461 --> 01:16:03,096
Oh, you're excited?

985
01:16:09,436 --> 01:16:12,273
Hooray!

986
01:16:12,806 --> 01:16:15,143
Look at you!

987
01:16:15,143 --> 01:16:16,576
You're so cute.

988
01:16:16,576 --> 01:16:18,045
Take your clothes off...

989
01:16:19,213 --> 01:16:20,481
You're so cute.

990
01:16:21,095 --> 01:16:23,196
You have such a cute body.

991
01:16:24,051 --> 01:16:25,753
How can he be so small?

992
01:16:25,753 --> 01:16:26,821
Go in now.

993
01:16:26,821 --> 01:16:28,055
Wow!

994
01:16:28,055 --> 01:16:29,690
This is fun!

995
01:16:32,493 --> 01:16:33,461
Oh, my!

996
01:16:33,461 --> 01:16:35,230
It's so nice and warm.

997
01:16:36,096 --> 01:16:37,631
How exciting.

998
01:16:37,631 --> 01:16:39,633
Oh, hot. Oh, hot.

999
01:16:39,633 --> 01:16:41,468
Let's get a bit of water on him.

1000
01:16:44,538 --> 01:16:46,565
You have such a pretty forehead.

1001
01:16:46,808 --> 01:16:49,976
Can't I quickly get married and star in

1002
01:16:49,976 --> 01:16:52,993
The Return of Superman Season 5 or so?

1003
01:16:53,146 --> 01:16:56,350
You need to be on Season 2 not 5.

1004
01:16:56,818 --> 01:16:58,285
How do I use this?

1005
01:16:59,012 --> 01:17:01,013
You don't put it on his body, right?

1006
01:17:01,121 --> 01:17:03,156
You get soap bubbles when you pour it in

1007
01:17:03,156 --> 01:17:04,591
as the tap is running.

1008
01:17:04,591 --> 01:17:05,926
Don't you pour it in water?

1009
01:17:05,926 --> 01:17:07,195
You do it with the tap on.

1010
01:17:07,195 --> 01:17:08,496
That's how you get bubbles.

1011
01:17:08,496 --> 01:17:09,330
Just pour it in.

1012
01:17:09,033 --> 01:17:11,334
- You don't use this on his body. / - You don't?

1013
01:17:11,631 --> 01:17:12,866
It's okay, just pour it in.

1014
01:17:12,866 --> 01:17:13,935
You can't just pour it in.

1015
01:17:13,935 --> 01:17:15,170
Then?

1016
01:17:15,017 --> 01:17:17,052
You have to do it in the bath tub.

1017
01:17:17,905 --> 01:17:19,073
No, no.

1018
01:17:22,176 --> 01:17:23,578
Just do this.

1019
01:17:24,845 --> 01:17:26,213
Are you sure?

1020
01:17:26,213 --> 01:17:27,215
You can't make bubbles like this?

1021
01:17:27,215 --> 01:17:28,950
- No, you can't. / - Then what do you do?

1022
01:17:28,095 --> 01:17:29,730
I know how to do it. I'll make them.

1023
01:17:30,585 --> 01:17:31,751
- You'll make the bubbles? / - Yes.

1024
01:17:31,751 --> 01:17:32,953
You have to make them in the bath tub.

1025
01:17:32,953 --> 01:17:34,155
Just play, I'll make some.

1026
01:17:34,155 --> 01:17:35,323
You'll make bubbles and bring them here?

1027
01:17:35,323 --> 01:17:37,791
You have to do it while the tap is on.

1028
01:17:37,791 --> 01:17:39,426
He knows a lot about bubbles.

1029
01:17:46,166 --> 01:17:47,701
- How fun. / - There are some bubbles.

1030
01:17:47,701 --> 01:17:49,570
There are. How fun!

1031
01:17:49,057 --> 01:17:51,560
He likes the water.

1032
01:17:52,073 --> 01:17:58,780
Oh, yeah! Dancing!

1033
01:17:58,078 --> 01:17:59,413
He likes it?

1034
01:18:00,115 --> 01:18:01,548
- Hey, Kang In. / - Yes?

1035
01:18:01,548 --> 01:18:03,565
- Is it working? / - Yes, we have bubbles.

1036
01:18:03,718 --> 01:18:05,253
Something doesn't sound right.

1037
01:18:05,253 --> 01:18:07,021
Is he doing something strange?

1038
01:18:07,021 --> 01:18:09,356
Are you doing something weird?

1039
01:18:09,089 --> 01:18:10,424
I'll scoop this over.

1040
01:18:11,225 --> 01:18:13,226
You're going to scoop that up and pour it in?

1041
01:18:14,295 --> 01:18:15,796
Help me.

1042
01:18:15,796 --> 01:18:17,165
It's okay. You do it.

1043
01:18:17,165 --> 01:18:19,166
Seojun will love you for it.

1044
01:18:22,007 --> 01:18:24,075
- He likes you. / - Look at him smile!

1045
01:18:24,138 --> 01:18:26,240
You smiled!

1046
01:18:26,908 --> 01:18:30,945
I think babies like me because I'm so immature.

1047
01:18:30,945 --> 01:18:32,580
No, my kids...

1048
01:18:32,058 --> 01:18:33,526
So it works that way.

1049
01:18:34,048 --> 01:18:35,716
You're getting it all over the floor.

1050
01:18:36,516 --> 01:18:38,085
How do you know this?

1051
01:18:38,085 --> 01:18:39,186
This guy...

1052
01:18:39,186 --> 01:18:41,321
I love taking baths.

1053
01:18:41,321 --> 01:18:43,223
- Wipe the floor. / - Yeah.

1054
01:18:43,725 --> 01:18:45,126
Can you wash hair with this?

1055
01:18:45,126 --> 01:18:46,260
I think so.

1056
01:18:47,161 --> 01:18:48,428
Oh, my goodness!

1057
01:18:48,428 --> 01:18:49,996
Look at your forehead.

1058
01:18:53,668 --> 01:18:55,970
Oh, that stings.

1059
01:18:55,097 --> 01:18:57,498
- I'm sorry. / - Oh, that stings.

1060
01:18:58,371 --> 01:19:00,006
- I'm sorry. / - Water!

1061
01:19:00,006 --> 01:19:01,008
It's okay.

1062
01:19:01,008 --> 01:19:02,410
Oh, that stings.

1063
01:19:02,041 --> 01:19:03,442
But he won't cry.

1064
01:19:03,811 --> 01:19:06,868
Seojun doesn't cry.

1065
01:19:08,215 --> 01:19:10,618
Seojun... How can he be so gentle?

1066
01:19:10,618 --> 01:19:11,585
This one is gentle.

1067
01:19:11,585 --> 01:19:13,592
As I told you before,

1068
01:19:13,655 --> 01:19:15,756
he could live out on his own.

1069
01:19:17,791 --> 01:19:19,860
That's how good he is.

1070
01:19:20,361 --> 01:19:22,330
He won't do anything dangerous.

1071
01:19:22,033 --> 01:19:23,066
- Oh, really? / - Yeah.

1072
01:19:23,363 --> 01:19:25,800
He'll never go behind there.

1073
01:19:25,008 --> 01:19:26,843
He only does it if something's there.

1074
01:19:27,635 --> 01:19:28,670
He never does anything dangerous.

1075
01:19:28,067 --> 01:19:31,270
Can't I be casted in Season 2 or 3?

1076
01:19:31,873 --> 01:19:33,140
You could right now.

1077
01:19:33,014 --> 01:19:34,182
- Right now? / - Now?

1078
01:19:34,308 --> 01:19:36,276
I haven't made anything public yet.

1079
01:19:36,276 --> 01:19:37,911
No?

1080
01:19:39,413 --> 01:19:40,548
Seojun, come here.

1081
01:19:40,548 --> 01:19:42,616
Do you have to wash again after a bubble bath?

1082
01:19:42,616 --> 01:19:43,551
Can't I just dry...

1083
01:19:43,551 --> 01:19:45,018
You have to rinse with water.

1084
01:19:45,018 --> 01:19:46,620
I have to rinse again with clean water?

1085
01:19:46,062 --> 01:19:47,330
- Yes. / - No way.

1086
01:19:47,888 --> 01:19:48,956
You have to.

1087
01:19:48,956 --> 01:19:51,973
If you watch the movies, they just come out.

1088
01:19:52,126 --> 01:19:53,961
They just wipe off the soap.

1089
01:19:53,961 --> 01:19:55,163
No way.

1090
01:19:55,163 --> 01:19:58,131
You have to rinse this.

1091
01:19:58,131 --> 01:19:59,566
Won't this be good for you?

1092
01:19:59,566 --> 01:20:01,101
No, you have to rinse.

1093
01:20:01,101 --> 01:20:03,178
This is edible... Where's the bottle?

1094
01:20:03,871 --> 01:20:06,173
Then have a glass, I'll pour some for you.

1095
01:20:06,506 --> 01:20:08,543
- Do you like that? / - Give me the bottle.

1096
01:20:10,178 --> 01:20:11,183
I'm not going to rinse.

1097
01:20:11,678 --> 01:20:12,755
I won't even if you're supposed to.

1098
01:20:13,448 --> 01:20:15,316
Okay, this is what it says on the instructions.

1099
01:20:15,316 --> 01:20:16,320
Bubble bath.

1100
01:20:17,318 --> 01:20:18,520
Here it is.

1101
01:20:19,062 --> 01:20:20,663
Made in Canada.

1102
01:20:21,956 --> 01:20:23,725
It's okay.

1103
01:20:24,491 --> 01:20:26,026
Hold on...

1104
01:20:26,026 --> 01:20:29,863
I think this every time I see him,

1105
01:20:29,863 --> 01:20:32,766
but I think Seojun takes after you more.

1106
01:20:32,766 --> 01:20:34,001
Oh, no.

1107
01:20:34,568 --> 01:20:36,303
You like that?

1108
01:20:36,303 --> 01:20:38,371
You like that, Seojun?

1109
01:20:38,371 --> 01:20:40,308
Why do you think he looks like me?

1110
01:20:40,308 --> 01:20:42,310
He's more active. How do I put it?

1111
01:20:42,031 --> 01:20:44,066
But he can't be like you when he grows up.

1112
01:20:44,345 --> 01:20:45,546
Why not?

1113
01:20:46,046 --> 01:20:47,948
He's a great guy for guys.

1114
01:20:48,415 --> 01:20:49,483
What about his nappy?

1115
01:20:49,483 --> 01:20:51,251
- Nappy? / - It's diaper.

1116
01:20:52,353 --> 01:20:53,721
Hey, just go home.

1117
01:20:53,721 --> 01:20:55,523
They are taking my energy.

1118
01:20:55,523 --> 01:20:57,658
You guys try too hard to be funny.

1119
01:20:57,658 --> 01:20:59,360
See, he says you're too noisy.

1120
01:20:59,036 --> 01:21:00,937
Okay, we'll be quiet then.

1121
01:21:02,396 --> 01:21:03,631
He wants to play more.

1122
01:21:03,631 --> 01:21:04,633
- You like the water. / - No more.

1123
01:21:04,831 --> 01:21:06,768
Seojun, you can't play too much.

1124
01:21:06,768 --> 01:21:08,570
He'll catch a cold.

1125
01:21:09,503 --> 01:21:10,171
No, Seojun.

1126
01:21:10,171 --> 01:21:13,306
Seojun must be a swimmer.

1127
01:21:13,306 --> 01:21:15,943
I just learned today that he likes swimming.

1128
01:21:15,943 --> 01:21:18,446
- Make him a swimmer. / - Wait here. I'll dry his hair.

1129
01:21:23,685 --> 01:21:24,451
Pororo!

1130
01:21:24,451 --> 01:21:25,553
No!

1131
01:21:32,426 --> 01:21:33,695
No!

1132
01:21:33,695 --> 01:21:34,695
Put his clothes on.

1133
01:21:34,695 --> 01:21:36,530
Can't have water go in!

1134
01:21:36,053 --> 01:21:37,688
Kang In and Heechul...

1135
01:21:38,165 --> 01:21:40,201
This is your last mission. Put his clothes on.

1136
01:21:44,938 --> 01:21:46,640
Seojun. Jump!

1137
01:21:47,708 --> 01:21:48,510
Jump!

1138
01:21:51,278 --> 01:21:52,980
He knows how to put pants on.

1139
01:21:53,748 --> 01:21:54,748
Seojun...

1140
01:21:56,045 --> 01:21:58,181
- Put your arm in here. / - Just wait.

1141
01:21:58,586 --> 01:22:00,053
Just put that on.

1142
01:22:00,053 --> 01:22:01,890
Where is Seojun's hand? It's here.

1143
01:22:01,089 --> 01:22:02,522
He's really strong.

1144
01:22:03,323 --> 01:22:05,326
- Seojun's hand! / - I like Super Junior.

1145
01:22:05,793 --> 01:22:07,395
- It's okay. / - I'm sorry.

1146
01:22:28,015 --> 01:22:30,042
Hey, you shouldn't be like that.

1147
01:22:30,285 --> 01:22:32,120
I'll postpone having a baby for now.

1148
01:22:32,012 --> 01:22:34,447
Seojun! You're all dressed.

1149
01:22:34,555 --> 01:22:36,423
- Applause! / - Applause.

1150
01:22:38,125 --> 01:22:40,093
Okay, rock, paper, scissors.

1151
01:22:40,093 --> 01:22:41,996
- How do we decide? / - Just do it with this.

1152
01:22:41,996 --> 01:22:42,963
To clean up?

1153
01:22:42,963 --> 01:22:45,040
If you don't play, you lose. Rock, paper, scissors.

1154
01:22:49,636 --> 01:22:50,971
- You do it. / - Why?

1155
01:22:50,971 --> 01:22:52,440
Okay then. If you don't play...

1156
01:22:52,044 --> 01:22:53,912
No, you're going to make one person do it?

1157
01:22:54,308 --> 01:22:55,743
Both of you should.

1158
01:22:55,743 --> 01:22:56,811
Let's do it together.

1159
01:22:56,811 --> 01:22:57,816
Okay then.

1160
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:03,150
You're going to take all the water out again?

1161
01:23:03,015 --> 01:23:04,416
You have to pour out a bit.

1162
01:23:04,551 --> 01:23:05,953
Be careful not to drop any water.

1163
01:23:05,953 --> 01:23:08,088
We should put a towel on the floor.

1164
01:23:08,088 --> 01:23:10,425
We can clean that later.

1165
01:23:11,391 --> 01:23:12,993
Super Junior are great.

1166
01:23:13,461 --> 01:23:15,330
Choi Hongman, Lee Hyundo...

1167
01:23:15,033 --> 01:23:16,066
Just forget them.

1168
01:23:16,363 --> 01:23:17,465
The uncles are cleaning up.

1169
01:23:17,465 --> 01:23:19,200
That's enough for today.

1170
01:23:19,002 --> 01:23:22,038
We can bath again next time. Don't be sad...

1171
01:23:22,236 --> 01:23:24,505
Where are the Jangs headed

1172
01:23:24,505 --> 01:23:26,606
on this sunny spring day?

1173
01:23:38,062 --> 01:23:41,398
Oh, and who do we have here?

1174
01:23:41,956 --> 01:23:43,223
Who is this?

1175
01:23:43,223 --> 01:23:44,658
Hello!

1176
01:23:49,023 --> 01:23:51,058
- Hello. / - Jihwon!

1177
01:23:51,265 --> 01:23:54,312
Junu, is it fun being with dad these days?

1178
01:23:54,735 --> 01:23:55,736
Yes!

1179
01:23:57,138 --> 01:23:57,905
Where are you headed?

1180
01:23:57,905 --> 01:23:59,952
- To get Junseo vaccinated. / - Yeah, vaccinations.

1181
01:24:00,375 --> 01:24:01,708
- Junseo! / - Yes?

1182
01:24:01,708 --> 01:24:02,843
Don't cry.

1183
01:24:02,843 --> 01:24:04,910
Yes, I'm going to sleep so I don't cry.

1184
01:24:11,385 --> 01:24:13,020
I told you not to sleep.

1185
01:24:13,488 --> 01:24:14,489
Why not?

1186
01:24:14,588 --> 01:24:16,791
You're too heavy for dad to carry.

1187
01:24:18,191 --> 01:24:19,993
Then anesthesia.

1188
01:24:19,993 --> 01:24:21,090
It'll just be a short prick.

1189
01:24:26,868 --> 01:24:28,903
Only just a few months ago...

1190
01:24:28,903 --> 01:24:33,975
Junseo caused such a fuss at the dentist.

1191
01:24:36,001 --> 01:24:39,304
Which is worse? The dentist or an injection?

1192
01:24:43,651 --> 01:24:45,085
Both are just as bad.

1193
01:24:46,012 --> 01:24:48,548
Junseo, don't worry too much.

1194
01:24:48,656 --> 01:24:51,893
You can be manly and not cry today.

1195
01:24:51,893 --> 01:24:52,893
- I'm scared. / - Sit down.

1196
01:24:52,893 --> 01:24:54,595
Hello. Let's take a look.

1197
01:24:54,595 --> 01:24:56,096
I'm scared.

1198
01:24:57,031 --> 01:24:58,265
Is he starting school this year?

1199
01:24:58,265 --> 01:24:59,866
- Yes, this year. / - Okay.

1200
01:24:59,866 --> 01:25:02,170
We have a few things to do before then.

1201
01:25:02,017 --> 01:25:04,618
Today, DTaP, polio and MMR.

1202
01:25:04,771 --> 01:25:08,075
Let's get those three injections.

1203
01:25:16,316 --> 01:25:17,351
Needle!

1204
01:25:22,009 --> 01:25:23,577
There we go.

1205
01:25:23,658 --> 01:25:25,293
Just take out your arm.

1206
01:25:25,293 --> 01:25:26,560
Not your head. No, no...

1207
01:25:26,056 --> 01:25:28,059
Just his arm?

1208
01:25:28,563 --> 01:25:29,568
Just need your arm.

1209
01:25:33,968 --> 01:25:35,170
We haven't started yet.

1210
01:25:35,017 --> 01:25:36,985
- You can cry when it hurts. / - I'm scared.

1211
01:25:38,305 --> 01:25:40,308
- You can cry if it hurts. / - I'm scared.

1212
01:25:40,308 --> 01:25:41,976
Can you do this?

1213
01:25:41,976 --> 01:25:44,378
- I'm scared. / - Hold his body. Hold him down...

1214
01:25:44,378 --> 01:25:45,880
It'll be over real quick.

1215
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:46,889
Hold him so he can't move.

1216
01:25:47,681 --> 01:25:50,285
- I'm scared. / - It'll be over in 3 seconds.

1217
01:25:52,186 --> 01:25:56,991
You don't have to look. Look at me.

1218
01:25:56,991 --> 01:25:59,626
Let's do the polio shot first.

1219
01:26:00,728 --> 01:26:00,737
Look at me.

1220
01:26:01,628 --> 01:26:05,065
This will sting a little.

1221
01:26:16,343 --> 01:26:17,811
Good boy.

1222
01:26:19,713 --> 01:26:24,818
- You're amazing. / - That's a relief.

1223
01:26:24,818 --> 01:26:26,855
You're as brave as your brother.

1224
01:26:38,966 --> 01:26:41,668
Wow, you're amazing, Junseo.

1225
01:26:41,668 --> 01:26:45,673
It hurts so much.

1226
01:26:47,641 --> 01:26:48,910
Can't you stop now?

1227
01:26:48,091 --> 01:26:49,492
It's the last one now.

1228
01:26:52,008 --> 01:26:53,909
Junseo, you're really brave.

1229
01:26:55,216 --> 01:26:57,151
Wow, you're amazing.

1230
01:26:58,092 --> 01:26:59,093
Wow.

1231
01:27:01,021 --> 01:27:01,856
All over.

1232
01:27:01,856 --> 01:27:02,923
It's all over.

1233
01:27:02,923 --> 01:27:04,191
Oh, that hurts.

1234
01:27:04,191 --> 01:27:06,248
Dad! That hurts.

1235
01:27:06,761 --> 01:27:08,730
- Does it? / - Gosh, it hurts.

1236
01:27:08,073 --> 01:27:11,409
- Well done. / - It hurts.

1237
01:27:13,001 --> 01:27:15,304
You've become really brave.

1238
01:27:15,403 --> 01:27:17,638
Please give me a band aid.

1239
01:27:17,638 --> 01:27:20,575
You already have one.

1240
01:27:20,575 --> 01:27:22,276
But it still hurts.

1241
01:27:27,915 --> 01:27:29,416
Is the family here?

1242
01:27:34,088 --> 01:27:34,955
They've never seen it.

1243
01:27:34,955 --> 01:27:37,358
I won't be filming this time.

1244
01:27:37,358 --> 01:27:40,295
They're making a DVD for the movie I was in.

1245
01:27:40,295 --> 01:27:43,431
And I took them to see how it works.

1246
01:27:44,998 --> 01:27:49,036
It's the first actors the Jun brothers will meet.

1247
01:27:49,536 --> 01:27:52,440
Who is the first actor?

1248
01:27:52,044 --> 01:27:55,147
It'd be really scary if all this falls down.

1249
01:27:57,345 --> 01:27:58,746
Hey, Sungkyun.

1250
01:28:01,481 --> 01:28:03,216
The man that cooks seaweed soup with mushrooms.

1251
01:28:03,216 --> 01:28:03,985
That's right.

1252
01:28:03,985 --> 01:28:06,353
The magician.

1253
01:28:07,021 --> 01:28:08,155
It's not only seaweed soup.

1254
01:28:08,155 --> 01:28:09,823
- Say hello to Uncle Sungkyun. / - Hello.

1255
01:28:09,823 --> 01:28:11,425
- Junseo. / - Hello.

1256
01:28:11,425 --> 01:28:13,452
You know who I am, right?

1257
01:28:15,796 --> 01:28:17,198
Don't you know how popular I am?

1258
01:28:17,198 --> 01:28:19,366
We don't get cable at home.

1259
01:28:27,175 --> 01:28:28,910
Are you the driver?

1260
01:28:29,343 --> 01:28:31,545
No. The driver will be here soon.

1261
01:28:32,213 --> 01:28:33,848
Are you the cleaner?

1262
01:28:33,848 --> 01:28:35,350
He'll be here soon too.

1263
01:28:35,035 --> 01:28:37,236
- Then the one who stabs with a knife? / - Yeah.

1264
01:28:40,288 --> 01:28:41,923
I'm the smiling one.

1265
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:50,727
He's really cute once you get to know him.

1266
01:28:56,017 --> 01:28:57,885
You said you liked that commercial, right?

1267
01:28:58,038 --> 01:29:00,095
- Which one? / - The one with the kid...

1268
01:29:00,608 --> 01:29:02,476
"Dad, can you get me a sibling?"

1269
01:29:02,476 --> 01:29:04,045
That one.

1270
01:29:05,313 --> 01:29:07,481
You said you liked that. He's that guy.

1271
01:29:07,481 --> 01:29:08,616
That's me.

1272
01:29:09,316 --> 01:29:10,451
Oh, really?

1273
01:29:11,418 --> 01:29:13,821
- The cocoa? / - Yeah.

1274
01:29:13,821 --> 01:29:15,090
That's him.

1275
01:29:15,009 --> 01:29:16,575
- For real? / - Yeah.

1276
01:29:19,826 --> 01:29:21,833
- You can communicate with them. / - Of course.

1277
01:29:21,896 --> 01:29:22,898
I can't converse at home.

1278
01:29:23,096 --> 01:29:25,233
- It won't take long. / - It's just one-sided.

1279
01:29:25,233 --> 01:29:26,238
What stage is he at?

1280
01:29:26,733 --> 01:29:28,936
- Now? He's an outlaw. / - Outlaw?

1281
01:29:28,936 --> 01:29:31,705
Where they knock things over and break them?

1282
01:29:32,406 --> 01:29:34,141
I say this to my kids.

1283
01:29:34,141 --> 01:29:36,143
Oh, my runt.

1284
01:29:36,143 --> 01:29:38,245
Then he goes...

1285
01:29:42,025 --> 01:29:45,628
Dad, you runt.

1286
01:29:46,686 --> 01:29:48,355
That's what he calls me.

1287
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:51,425
It feels like he's cursing at me.

1288
01:29:53,528 --> 01:29:55,830
I bet he doesn't know what he's saying.

1289
01:29:55,083 --> 01:29:57,251
You just have to laugh.

1290
01:30:04,805 --> 01:30:06,808
More uncles have arrived.

1291
01:30:06,808 --> 01:30:07,808
Really?

1292
01:30:13,748 --> 01:30:14,751
Who is it now?

1293
01:30:15,048 --> 01:30:18,075
Hello, Junseo and Junu.

1294
01:30:18,318 --> 01:30:19,220
Hey.

1295
01:30:27,261 --> 01:30:28,530
Hello, Junseo and Junu.

1296
01:30:28,053 --> 01:30:28,686
Hey.

1297
01:30:29,163 --> 01:30:30,531
Hello...

1298
01:30:31,298 --> 01:30:33,801
- Hello. / - Say hello, Junseo.

1299
01:30:33,801 --> 01:30:35,270
- Say hello. / - Hello.

1300
01:30:35,027 --> 01:30:35,035
Hey.

1301
01:30:36,007 --> 01:30:37,508
You've grown a lot.

1302
01:30:38,054 --> 01:30:39,487
Do you remember him?

1303
01:30:39,973 --> 01:30:42,710
The man with the bone in "The Yellow Sea."

1304
01:30:48,045 --> 01:30:49,611
Do you remember him, Junseo?

1305
01:30:50,016 --> 01:30:51,385
No!

1306
01:30:53,022 --> 01:30:54,490
You saw him when you were too young.

1307
01:30:56,223 --> 01:30:57,625
We've known each other for ages.

1308
01:30:57,625 --> 01:31:01,161
He's virtually my brother now.

1309
01:31:01,161 --> 01:31:03,263
Back from when we really struggled

1310
01:31:03,263 --> 01:31:04,798
as theater actors.

1311
01:31:04,798 --> 01:31:06,433
We've known each other since

1312
01:31:06,433 --> 01:31:07,735
before we were married.

1313
01:31:08,235 --> 01:31:12,006
Our families get together many times too.

1314
01:31:13,206 --> 01:31:16,310
So the kids have to wait for 2 hours?

1315
01:31:16,031 --> 01:31:16,999
That's right.

1316
01:31:18,245 --> 01:31:20,248
But you'll be bored.

1317
01:31:22,015 --> 01:31:25,351
Junseo, is it more fun to be with dad than mom?

1318
01:31:27,188 --> 01:31:28,155
What?

1319
01:31:30,258 --> 01:31:32,626
Is it more fun with dad than mom?

1320
01:31:34,295 --> 01:31:38,031
What did you say?

1321
01:31:43,938 --> 01:31:45,673
Now that you hang out with me,

1322
01:31:45,673 --> 01:31:48,241
is it more fun than being with mom?

1323
01:31:48,241 --> 01:31:50,076
It is a little tough too.

1324
01:31:50,076 --> 01:31:51,578
Why? What's tough about it?

1325
01:31:52,068 --> 01:31:53,503
Because mom might be sad.

1326
01:31:54,115 --> 01:31:55,250
Is that why?

1327
01:31:55,883 --> 01:31:57,818
But I make it much more fun.

1328
01:32:02,156 --> 01:32:04,625
Dad, what's your weapon?

1329
01:32:04,625 --> 01:32:07,128
Dad does the strategizing.

1330
01:32:07,861 --> 01:32:08,830
Right?

1331
01:32:09,496 --> 01:32:12,503
Then you're the smartest in "Hwayi."

1332
01:32:13,535 --> 01:32:15,570
He is the smartest guy.

1333
01:32:16,436 --> 01:32:17,638
In "Hwayi?"

1334
01:32:17,638 --> 01:32:18,440
Yeah.

1335
01:32:21,776 --> 01:32:24,178
But you're not as smart in real life?

1336
01:32:24,178 --> 01:32:27,275
What? Do you think I'm smart or not?

1337
01:32:30,218 --> 01:32:32,853
You're not as smart.

1338
01:32:34,255 --> 01:32:35,490
Why do you say that?

1339
01:32:36,791 --> 01:32:38,025
You really go easy on them.

1340
01:32:38,025 --> 01:32:39,560
Yeah...

1341
01:32:41,361 --> 01:32:43,865
- I'm bored. / - Okay then...

1342
01:32:45,166 --> 01:32:46,133
Hello.

1343
01:32:46,133 --> 01:32:47,401
Hey, Jinwoong.

1344
01:32:48,135 --> 01:32:49,670
Happy New Year.

1345
01:32:50,438 --> 01:32:51,840
Boys, say hello.

1346
01:32:51,084 --> 01:32:53,485
Hello.

1347
01:32:54,241 --> 01:32:56,376
- It's the driving uncle. / - Yeah.

1348
01:33:00,115 --> 01:33:01,120
You're really handsome.

1349
01:33:01,615 --> 01:33:02,850
Thank you.

1350
01:33:04,851 --> 01:33:07,688
I'm your fan.

1351
01:33:07,688 --> 01:33:09,755
- Say thank you. / - Thank you.

1352
01:33:10,358 --> 01:33:11,591
When you look at me now...

1353
01:33:11,591 --> 01:33:13,226
Everything works out for him.

1354
01:33:13,928 --> 01:33:15,563
No matter what he does.

1355
01:33:15,563 --> 01:33:17,531
For some guys things just don't work

1356
01:33:17,531 --> 01:33:18,733
when they're with a girl.

1357
01:33:18,733 --> 01:33:20,468
And there are others when everything just works.

1358
01:33:20,468 --> 01:33:22,403
Even things that didn't work before.

1359
01:33:23,037 --> 01:33:25,104
- Especially when there's a girl present. / - Right.

1360
01:33:26,004 --> 01:33:28,305
How can it work out so well?

1361
01:33:28,341 --> 01:33:29,376
So funny.

1362
01:33:35,483 --> 01:33:36,918
Oh, you're in a drama.

1363
01:33:36,918 --> 01:33:36,927
Yes.

Isn't there a playroom around here?

1370
01:33:53,366 --> 01:33:54,835
No...

1371
01:33:56,871 --> 01:34:01,575
No one normally brings kids here.

1372
01:34:02,276 --> 01:34:03,878
Then what do we do?

1373
01:34:04,478 --> 01:34:05,346
You guys?

1374
01:34:05,946 --> 01:34:07,315

And the Jangs head off to Busan.

1380
01:34:29,836 --> 01:34:32,940
Who is this cute baby they meet there?

1381

So cute.

1382
01:34:35,876 --> 01:34:38,893
Meanwhile, Sarang becomes more and more drawn in

1383
01:34:39,046 --> 01:34:41,883
by her boyfriend's charms.

1384
01:34:44,418 --> 01:34:46,495
