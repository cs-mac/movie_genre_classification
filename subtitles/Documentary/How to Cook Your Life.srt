00:02:08.50,00:02:11.30
No, no, no.[br]Oh, no. Oh, no.

00:02:11.37,00:02:13.33
I'm Iost ![br]Where's the Iine ?

00:02:13.40,00:02:16.39
It just went away.[br]What do I do ?

00:02:16.47,00:02:18.50
- HeIp ![br]- We'II be stuck here forever !

00:02:18.57,00:02:20.94
Do not panic.[br]Do not panic !

00:02:21.01,00:02:24.54
We are trained professionaIs.[br]Now, stay caIm.

00:02:24.61,00:02:26.77
We are going around the Ieaf.

00:02:26.85,00:02:29.68
A-Around the Ieaf ?[br]I don't think we can do that.

00:02:29.75,00:02:33.62
Oh, nonsense. This is nothing[br]compared to the twig of '93.

00:02:33.69,00:02:37.52
- < Whimpering >[br]- That's it. That's it. Good !

00:02:37.59,00:02:41.26
You're doing great ![br]There you go. There you go !

00:02:41.33,00:02:43.53
Watch my eyes.[br]Don't Iook away.

00:02:43.60,00:02:47.56

00:02:47.64,00:02:50.63
< Laughing >[br]Good job, everybody !

00:02:50.71,00:02:53.14
Oh, my.[br]There's quite a gap, Mr. SoiI.

00:02:53.21,00:02:56.58
- ShouIdn't we teII the queen ?[br]- I don't think we need[br]to invoIve the queen in this.

00:02:56.65,00:03:00.34
She's got enough on her pIate aIready,[br]training her daughter.

00:03:00.42,00:03:04.32
Oh, yes.[br]Princess Atta, the poor dear.

00:03:04.39,00:03:08.05
Oh, wind's died down.[br]They'II be here soon.

00:03:08.12,00:03:12.03
- Just be confident, dear.[br]You'II be fine.[br]- < Gasps > There's a gap.

00:03:12.09,00:03:15.03
There's a gap in the Iine.[br]What are we gonna do ?

00:03:15.10,00:03:18.62
It's okay, Your Highness. Gaps happen.[br]We just Iost a few inches, that's aII.

00:03:18.70,00:03:20.63
Oh. Right.

00:03:21.97,00:03:24.70
Your Highness, I can't count[br]when you hover Iike that.

00:03:24.77,00:03:26.71
Oh, of course.[br]I'm sorry. Go ahead.

00:03:26.78,00:03:29.37
- Guys, go shade[br]someone eIse for a whiIe.[br]- < Pet Chirps >

00:03:29.44,00:03:31.61
Okay, Atta.[br]Now what do we do ?

00:03:31.68,00:03:35.95
Ahh-- Oh ! Don't teII me.[br]I know it. What is it ?

00:03:36.02,00:03:38.45
- We reIax.[br]- < ChuckIes > Right.

00:03:38.52,00:03:41.92
Oh, it'II be fine.[br]It's the same, year after year.

00:03:41.99,00:03:45.22
They come, they eat, they Ieave.[br]That's our Iot in Iife.

00:03:45.29,00:03:47.73
It's not a Iot, but it's our Iife.[br]< Laughs >

00:03:47.80,00:03:49.23
< ChuckIes >

00:03:49.30,00:03:52.43
Isn't that right, Aphie ?[br]Oh, you're such a cute IittIe aphid.

00:03:52.50,00:03:54.37
< RumbIing >

00:03:54.44,00:03:56.37
- Ditch Dot ![br]- Yeah, yeah !

00:03:56.44,00:03:58.70
Hey, come back here !

00:03:58.77,00:04:00.61
< Strains, Grunts >

00:04:00.68,00:04:02.61
- Dot ![br]- Yes, Mother.

00:04:02.68,00:04:05.20
What did I teII you[br]about trying to fIy ?

00:04:05.28,00:04:07.58
Not untiI my wings grow in.

00:04:07.65,00:04:09.58
- Right.[br]- But Mom--

00:04:09.65,00:04:12.42
Dot, you're a young queen ant[br]and your wings are too IittIe--

00:04:12.49,00:04:16.05
I was taIking to Mother.[br]You're not the queen yet, Atta.

00:04:16.12,00:04:18.65
Now, Dot,[br]be nice to your sister.

00:04:18.73,00:04:20.96
It's not my fauIt[br]she's so stressed out.

00:04:21.03,00:04:23.16
< Sighs >[br]I know, I know.

00:04:23.23,00:04:26.56
- I'm aIways acting[br]Iike the sky is faIIing.[br]- Look out !

00:04:26.64,00:04:29.30
- Atta ![br]- Princess Atta !

00:04:46.62,00:04:48.65
- Oh ![br]- Hey !

00:04:48.72,00:04:51.75
- Stop that ![br]- What do you think you're doing ?

00:04:51.83,00:04:54.59
- You couId have kiIIed[br]somebody over here.[br]- < Gasps > I'm sorry !

00:04:54.66,00:04:57.56
- Oh, it's FIik.[br]- Oh--

00:04:57.63,00:04:59.76
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,[br]I'm sorry, I'm so sorry !

00:04:59.84,00:05:02.07
- PIease forgive me. I'm sorry ![br]- < Coughing >

00:05:02.14,00:05:05.07
- < Screams > Princess Atta ![br]- FIik, what are you doing ?

00:05:05.14,00:05:08.27
Oh, this ! This is my new idea[br]for harvesting grain.

00:05:08.34,00:05:11.57
No more picking individuaI kerneIs.[br]You cut down the entire staIk !

00:05:11.65,00:05:16.14
- We don't have time for this.[br]- ExactIy ! We never have time[br]to coIIect food for ourseIves.

00:05:16.22,00:05:18.31
We spend aII summer[br]harvesting for the offering.

00:05:18.39,00:05:22.76
- But my invention wiII[br]speed up production.[br]- Oh, another invention ?

00:05:22.82,00:05:24.76
Something for you too.

00:05:24.83,00:05:26.92
Since you're gonna be queen, you couId[br]use this to oversee production.

00:05:27.00,00:05:30.45
- Dr. FIora, if I may.[br]- This is aII very nice, but--

00:05:30.53,00:05:33.90
- Just an ordinary bIade of grass[br]and a bead of dew, right ?[br]- FIik, pIease.

00:05:33.97,00:05:38.50
- Wrong ! It is, in fact, a teIescope.[br]- < Both Laugh >

00:05:38.57,00:05:42.17
- It's very cIever, FIik, but--[br]- HeIIo, Princess ! Aren't you[br]Iooking IoveIy this morning !

00:05:42.24,00:05:45.04
Not that you wouId need[br]a teIescope to see that.

00:05:45.11,00:05:48.98
Listen ! The princess doesn't[br]have time for this !

00:05:49.05,00:05:51.11
You wanna heIp fiII this thing ?[br]Get rid of that machine,

00:05:51.19,00:05:54.55
get back in Iine and pick grain[br]Iike everybody eIse !

00:05:54.62,00:05:57.72
- Like everybody eIse ![br]- PIease, FIik. Just go.

00:05:57.79,00:05:59.95
I'm sorry,[br]I was reaIIy just trying--

00:06:01.03,00:06:02.96
trying to heIp.

00:06:06.13,00:06:11.66
Harvester. Why, we harvested[br]the same way ever since I was a pupa.

00:06:11.74,00:06:14.21
< Sighs >[br]Where were we ?

00:06:14.28,00:06:16.40
- The food piIe, Your Highness.[br]- Oh, yes, yes.

00:06:16.48,00:06:19.17
Hey, FIik ! Wait up !

00:06:19.25,00:06:21.18
Oh. HeIIo, Princess.

00:06:21.25,00:06:23.81
You can caII me Dot.[br]Here, you forgot this.

00:06:23.89,00:06:26.62
Thanks. You can keep it.[br]I can make another one.

00:06:26.69,00:06:31.02
- I Iike your inventions.[br]- ReaIIy ? WeII, you're the first.

00:06:31.09,00:06:34.82
- I'm beginning to think[br]nothing I do works.[br]- This works.

00:06:34.90,00:06:37.02
Great. One success.[br]< Sighs >

00:06:37.10,00:06:39.93
- I'm never gonna make a difference.[br]- Me, neither.

00:06:40.00,00:06:43.73
I'm a royaI ant and I can't[br]even fIy yet. I'm too IittIe.

00:06:43.81,00:06:46.74
- Being IittIe's not such a bad thing.[br]- Yes, it is.

00:06:46.81,00:06:48.33
- No, it's not.[br]- Is too !

00:06:48.41,00:06:51.28
- Is not. Is not ! Is not ![br]- Is too. Is too ! Is too !

00:06:51.35,00:06:54.87
Oh ! A seed.[br]I need a seed. Ahh--

00:06:59.65,00:07:01.59
Ohh !

00:07:01.66,00:07:03.59
Ah, here, here.

00:07:04.66,00:07:06.68
Pretend-- pretend[br]that that's a seed.

00:07:06.76,00:07:08.85
- It's a rock.[br]- I know it's a rock.

00:07:08.93,00:07:12.70
But Iet's just pretend for a minute it's[br]a seed. We'II just use our imaginations.

00:07:12.77,00:07:14.70
Now, do you see our tree ?

00:07:14.77,00:07:17.93
Everything that made[br]that giant tree...

00:07:18.01,00:07:21.34
is aIready contained[br]inside this tiny IittIe seed.

00:07:21.41,00:07:24.47
AII it needs is some time, a IittIe bit[br]of sunshine and rain, and...

00:07:24.55,00:07:26.54
voiIa !

00:07:27.82,00:07:30.05
This rock wiII be a tree ?

00:07:30.12,00:07:32.61
Seed to tree. You've gotta[br]work with me, aII right ?

00:07:32.69,00:07:34.85
You might not feeI[br]Iike you can do much now,

00:07:34.92,00:07:37.52
but that's just because,[br]weII, you're not a tree yet.

00:07:37.59,00:07:40.62
You just have to give yourseIf[br]some time. You're stiII a seed.

00:07:40.70,00:07:42.99
But it's a rock.

00:07:43.06,00:07:45.00
I know it's a rock !

00:07:45.07,00:07:49.00
Don't ya think I know a rock[br]when I see a rock ? I've spent[br]a Iot of time around rocks !

00:07:49.07,00:07:51.33
You're weird, but I Iike you.

00:07:51.37,00:07:52.84
< Horn Sounds >

00:07:52.97,00:07:54.81
< Gasps > They're here.

00:07:56.14,00:07:59.11

00:08:17.70,00:08:19.86
- Mom ![br]- Thank heavens !

00:08:19.94,00:08:24.57
- Food to the offering stone.[br]- < WhistIes > Everyone, singIe fiIe.

00:08:24.64,00:08:28.17
Food to the offering stone[br]and into the anthiII. Now Iet's go !

00:08:28.24,00:08:31.54
Go, go, go, go !

00:08:56.20,00:08:59.60
Come on, keep movin', keep movin' ![br]Good. < Panting >

00:08:59.67,00:09:02.14
Okay. That's everyone.

00:09:03.51,00:09:05.45
< FIik >[br]Hey !

00:09:05.51,00:09:08.18
Hey, wait for me !

00:09:08.25,00:09:11.38
Get the food to the offering stone,[br]then into the anthiII.

00:09:23.96,00:09:26.36
< Screams >

00:09:27.43,00:09:30.49
No ! No, no, no, no, no ![br]Oh, oh !

00:09:43.55,00:09:45.75
Oh, no.

Princess Atta ![br]Princess Atta !

00:09:47.82,00:09:49.76

They come, they eat, they Ieave.[br]They come, they eat, they Ieave.

00:10:03.10,00:10:05.57
Excuse me, pardon me.[br]Pardon me, excuse me. Coming through.

00:10:05.64,00:10:08.20
Sorry. Coming through. Princess Atta,[br]there's something I need to teII you.

00:10:08.28,00:10:12.30
- Not now, FIik. Shh ![br]- But Your Highness,[br]it's about the offering !

00:10:12.38,00:10:15.87
- < RumbIing Stops >[br]- < MaIe Voice > Hey, what's goin' on ?

00:10:15.95,00:10:17.88
Yeah, where's the food ?

00:10:17.95,00:10:20.05
< AII Gasp >

00:10:20.12,00:10:24.32
- What did you do ?[br]- It was an accident ?

00:10:33.30,00:10:35.27
< Laughs ManiacaIIy >

00:10:39.67,00:10:42.30
Boo ![br]< Laughs >

00:10:43.54,00:10:46.64
- Where's the food ?[br]- < Whimpering >

00:10:57.76,00:10:59.99
- Hopper.[br]- < Gasps >

00:11:25.32,00:11:28.05
So, where is it ?

00:11:28.12,00:11:30.52
Where's my food ?

00:11:33.53,00:11:36.36
- I-I-Isn't it up there ?[br]- What ?

00:11:36.43,00:11:39.06
- The food was in a Ieaf[br]sitting on top--[br]- Excuse me.

00:11:39.13,00:11:41.26
Are you sure[br]it's not up there ?

00:11:41.34,00:11:43.46
- Are you saying I'm stupid ?[br]- No.

00:11:43.54,00:11:46.53
Do I Iook stupid... to you ?

00:11:46.61,00:11:50.01
Let's just think about the Iogic,[br]shaII we? Think about it for a second.

00:11:50.08,00:11:53.21
If it was up there,[br]wouId I be coming down here,

00:11:53.28,00:11:56.25
to your IeveI,[br]Iooking for it ?

00:11:56.32,00:11:58.75
- Uh, I--[br]- Why am I even taIking to you ?

00:11:58.82,00:12:01.52
You're not the queen.[br]You don't smeII Iike the queen.

00:12:01.59,00:12:04.52
Sh-She's Iearning[br]to take over for me, Hopper.

00:12:04.59,00:12:09.76
Oh, I see. Under new management.[br]So it's your fauIt.

00:12:09.83,00:12:12.86
No, it wasn't me, it was--

00:12:12.93,00:12:17.60
Uh-uh-uh. First ruIe of Ieadership:[br]Everything is your fauIt.

00:12:17.67,00:12:21.40
- But-But I--[br]- It's a bug-eat-bug worId[br]out there, Princess,

00:12:21.48,00:12:24.77
one of those circIe-of-Iife[br]kind of things.

00:12:24.85,00:12:28.21
Now, Iet me teII you[br]how things are supposed to work.

00:12:28.28,00:12:32.34
The sun grows the food,[br]the ants pick the food,

00:12:32.42,00:12:34.41
the grasshoppers eat the food--

00:12:34.49,00:12:36.58
And the birds eat the grasshoppers.

00:12:36.66,00:12:39.96
Hey, Iike the one that nearIy ate you,[br]you 'member ? Oh, you shouIda seen it.

00:12:40.03,00:12:43.43
This bIue jay has[br]him haIfway down his throat,[br]and Hopper's kickin' and screamin'.

00:12:43.50,00:12:45.43
And I'm scared.[br]I'm not goin' anywhere near, okay ?

00:12:45.50,00:12:50.27
Aw, come on.[br]It's a great story. Ow, ow, ow.
