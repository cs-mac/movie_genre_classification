Sorry, you cut with
in the middle of yoga.

5
00:01:14,304 --> 00:01:17,668
Do you expect the 'hunched Dog'?
(Yoga postures).

6
00:01:18,192 --> 00:01:20,847
My name is Mr. Peabody.

7
00:01:20,848 --> 00:01:23,269
And if you spend some time together
...

8
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:25,657
... I
tell you some things about me.

9
00:01:25,658 --> 00:01:27,288
Viewing,
since I was a puppy,

10
00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:29,150
was evident,
that I was different.

11
00:01:30,711 --> 00:01:33,326

"No, thanks"... </ i></i>

<i> But for some reason,
me never chose. </ I></i>

16
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,570
Come on, boy,
fetch the stick!

17
00:01:48,571 --> 00:01:50,834
But why?
Do not discarded?

18
00:01:50,835 --> 00:01:53,329
Is exercise in futility.

19
00:01:53,426 --> 00:01:56,244
Do not want him him, Mommy.
Is sarcastic.

20
00:01:56,245 --> 00:01:58,155
Wait, come back!
Drop the stick.

21
00:01:58,156 --> 00:01:59,537
'll Fetch, will sit judiciously,

22
00:01:59,538 --> 00:02:00,885
I'll even shake his hand!

23
00:02:00,886 --> 00:02:02,988
Bark, bark.

<i>... the Zouba! </ I></i>

36
00:02:48,022 --> 00:02:51,019
But more than
all'm proud of my son.

37
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:51,974
Sherman.

38
00:02:52,009 --> 00:02:53,808
Hello, Mr. Peabody.

39
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:57,915
You told them about "Back in Time"?

40
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,982
Now I say.

41
00:03:00,085 --> 00:03:01,343
When I adopted Sherman,

42
00:03:01,344 --> 00:03:03,603
vowed to be as good a father as possible.

43
00:03:03,604 --> 00:03:07,950
Prepare him for all
wonders of the world, present and past.

44
00:03:07,951 --> 00:03:12,462
So, Sherman
inspired the greatest invention of my life.

45
00:03:12,687 --> 00:03:14,899
Time machine!

46
00:03:21,097 --> 00:03:25,186
Of course, time travel
may be a little... unpredictable.

47
00:03:25,187 --> 00:03:27,484
There may be several setbacks
path.

48
00:03:27,485 --> 00:03:30,760
For example, the Leaning Tower of Pisa
was not always inclined.

49
00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:34,001
But
nothing compares to learning firsthand

50
00:03:34,002 --> 00:03:35,477
lessons of history.
Right, Sherman?

51
00:03:35,478 --> 00:03:37,824
In what part would go today,
Mr. Peabody?

52
00:03:37,825 --> 00:03:40,403
Not in what part, Sherman,
but at what time.

53
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,348
<b> French Revolution-1789 </ b></b>

54
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:56,428
The biggest house I've ever seen!

55
00:03:56,429 --> 00:03:59,675
<i> Is Versailles,
residence of Marie Antoinette. </ I></i>

56
00:03:59,676 --> 00:04:02,107
<i>Mostly   was known for one thing: </ i></i>

57
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:06,562
"Cake! How I love cake!"

58
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:14,100
She loves the cakes,
Mr. Peabody.

59
00:04:14,101 --> 00:04:15,311
Indeed likes.

60
00:04:15,312 --> 00:04:17,415
Maria was a woman with a huge appetite

61
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,107
For what had whipped up.

62
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:22,426
But the expensive taste of
made her a target for criticism.

63
00:04:22,427 --> 00:04:23,099
Why?

64
00:04:23,134 --> 00:04:25,591
Because, Sherman, during the reign of
...

65
00:04:25,592 --> 00:04:28,730
The people of France were extremely poor.

66
00:04:28,731 --> 00:04:32,869
- Got any bread?
- Not! I am very poor!

67
00:04:33,295 --> 00:04:36,092
- Now we can have some cake?
- But of course!

68
00:04:36,214 --> 00:04:40,215
Sorry, we could
Let's have some cake?

69
00:04:40,216 --> 00:04:41,676
But, of course!

70
00:04:41,711 --> 00:04:43,446
You can not hear me
through hair.

71
00:04:43,447 --> 00:04:46,451
Sherman, what
means the queen is...

72
00:04:46,807 --> 00:04:49,549
Let them eat cake!

73
00:04:50,917 --> 00:04:53,806
And when the hearing including Queen
that the people of Paris...

74
00:04:53,807 --> 00:04:55,354
... could not buy bread or...

75
00:04:55,355 --> 00:04:58,191
... said:
"Give them eat cake!"

76
00:04:58,234 --> 00:04:59,727
Yes, I heard it myself.

77
00:04:59,728 --> 00:05:01,370
- Scandal!
- Shocking!

78
00:05:01,371 --> 00:05:03,723
- Down with the Queen!
- Down with the monarchy!

79
00:05:03,724 --> 00:05:04,855
Wait.

80
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,345
What kind of cake?

81
00:05:07,526 --> 00:05:09,024
Long live the Revolution!

82
00:05:09,025 --> 00:05:11,440
Long live the Revolution!

83
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,917
The party 'kicks ass', Your Majesty...

84
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:18,886
... But now, I fear
Sherman and I have...

85
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,317
Sherman. Sherman!

86
00:05:21,608 --> 00:05:22,884
Sherman!

87
00:05:25,193 --> 00:05:26,339
Sherman?

88
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,345
Seeerman!

89
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:33,655
- Sherman!
- Hi, Mr. Peabody.

90
00:05:33,656 --> 00:05:35,184
What are you doing here?

91
00:05:35,185 --> 00:05:37,229
Try other cakes.

92
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:41,604
There is a  here, with whipped cream and strawberries
, which is...

93
00:05:41,847 --> 00:05:43,826
... fantastic!

94
00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:46,735
Sherman, do not remember why I
I told you to stay close to me...

95
00:05:46,736 --> 00:05:48,310
... during the French Revolution?

96
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:51,415
Because  after the French Revolution, it rained
?

97
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:54,052
Because, after the French Revolution...

98
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:57,008
... comes the panic!

99
00:06:00,123 --> 00:06:02,341
Long live the Revolution!

100
00:06:02,342 --> 00:06:04,627
Surround aristocrats!

101
00:06:19,149 --> 00:06:22,330
The Queen  and classy
minions...

102
00:06:22,331 --> 00:06:25,544
... must pay the price
for their greed!

103
00:06:25,545 --> 00:06:28,724
Will slaughter them like dogs,
as they deserve!

104
00:06:28,725 --> 00:06:30,831
Starting with this!

105
00:06:30,859 --> 00:06:33,990
Mr Peabody, what to do?

106
00:06:33,991 --> 00:06:36,984
Nothing Sherman,
stay where you are!

107
00:06:36,985 --> 00:06:38,326
But Mr Peabody...

108
00:06:38,327 --> 00:06:42,984
All will go well, Sherman.
You stay right where you are!

109
00:06:49,597 --> 00:06:51,624
Cut his head off!

110
00:06:53,623 --> 00:06:55,901
Mr. Peabody!

111
00:07:01,937 --> 00:07:05,555
kantaloup? (Type of melon).
The worst of the food!

112
00:07:05,556 --> 00:07:09,345
What else would tolerate now?

113
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:15,868
Find this dog!

114
00:07:16,054 --> 00:07:18,373
Mr Peabody, how you escaped?

115
00:07:18,374 --> 00:07:19,361
Simple, Sherman.

116
00:07:19,396 --> 00:07:21,534
I watched
distance between the tops of the sewer...

117
00:07:21,535 --> 00:07:24,280
... I thought that there must be some
just below the guillotine...

118
00:07:24,281 --> 00:07:25,770
... I noticed the loose plank
under the basket...

119
00:07:25,771 --> 00:07:28,230
... Calculate the angle at which the sun
will be reflected in the glasses...

120
00:07:28,231 --> 00:07:30,176
... momentarily blinding the executioner...

121
00:07:30,177 --> 00:07:32,549
... and chose that moment to put the
melon...

122
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,236
... Which gave me the extra weight
...

123
00:07:34,237 --> 00:07:35,964
... to facilitate my escape.

124
00:07:35,965 --> 00:07:36,690
Fantastic!

125
00:07:36,725 --> 00:07:39,720
No. It was to keep my head
.

126
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,338
Keep your head...

127
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:43,709
not understand.

128
00:07:43,982 --> 00:07:45,940
There he is!
Hunt them down!

129
00:07:45,941 --> 00:07:48,130
Come on, Sherman, quickly!

130
00:07:52,107 --> 00:07:53,764
This water has horrible taste!

131
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:56,517
Interestingly,
that is not water!

132
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:02,521
You got now!

133
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:07,316
Indeed, sir Robespierre...

134
00:08:07,317 --> 00:08:10,299
... And what a terrible craftsman
to chase you!

135
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,342
Noticed.

136
00:08:11,377 --> 00:08:15,213
But naturally. So as you came
behind me, it was genius.

137
00:08:15,214 --> 00:08:15,978
Thank you.

138
00:08:16,013 --> 00:08:18,209
I just hope not to get
my little accomplice of here,

139
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:19,904
because it is based entirely on it.

140
00:08:19,905 --> 00:08:21,162
Come here you!

141
00:08:21,197 --> 00:08:23,245
- You are fiendishly clever, sir.
- I know.

142
00:08:23,246 --> 00:08:24,791
And much faster than you.

143
00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:26,303
But you're quick enough...

144
00:08:26,304 --> 00:08:27,470
... so what?

145
00:08:27,505 --> 00:08:28,660
See? Express!

146
00:08:28,661 --> 00:08:31,409
Express may,
but not so smart.

147
00:08:31,432 --> 00:08:33,763
Another kantaloup!
Your sword.

148
00:08:34,864 --> 00:08:36,677
Well, Sherman seems
that the time

149
00:08:36,678 --> 00:08:38,747
A short quiz
in the art of swordsmanship!

150
00:08:38,748 --> 00:08:39,631
Go!

151
00:08:40,316 --> 00:08:42,979
Forward! Balance!
Shaking! Repeat!

152
00:09:01,788 --> 00:09:04,610
- Missed!
- Do not miss ever.

153
00:09:14,451 --> 00:09:15,419
Yes!

154
00:09:20,457 --> 00:09:21,845
Do you smell something, Sherman?

155
00:09:21,846 --> 00:09:23,692
I was not, Mr Peabody.

156
00:09:23,693 --> 00:09:26,454
I know. Is the methane from
sanitation.

157
00:09:26,455 --> 00:09:29,426
Since exploding
at 150 degrees...

158
00:09:29,427 --> 00:09:32,759
... will use it,
to jump from here!

159
00:09:33,596 --> 00:09:34,540
Hold on!

160
00:09:37,241 --> 00:09:52,941
Yield  hearsay:
Calamity Jane

161
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:58,959
Nice landing,
not think, Sherman?

162
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:03,173
Well, what did you learn today, Sherman?

163
00:10:03,174 --> 00:10:05,461
This French revolution
was madness!

164
00:10:05,462 --> 00:10:06,480
That?

165
00:10:06,515 --> 00:10:08,812
All these
executions and beheadings...

166
00:10:08,813 --> 00:10:11,539
... and nobody dares to say that
was not right.

167
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,193
And think:

168
00:10:12,228 --> 00:10:14,278
Marie Antoinette
could have avoided the revolution

169
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:15,841
If just issued a decree...

170
00:10:15,842 --> 00:10:17,554
... to share bread to the poor.

171
00:10:17,555 --> 00:10:19,400
But then, would not have dessert.

172
00:10:19,401 --> 00:10:21,068
Why, Mr. Peabody?

173
00:10:21,069 --> 00:10:25,861
Because Sherman,
can not be got and cake and decree.

174
00:10:27,204 --> 00:10:28,226
Not understand.

175
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:41,000
Where to go tomorrow, Mr. Peabody?

176
00:10:41,001 --> 00:10:44,367
In Ancient Rome? In the Wild West?
In 1492?

177
00:10:44,368 --> 00:10:47,612
No, Sherman. Tomorrow will not go into
none of these places.

178
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:48,771
Why?

179
00:10:48,974 --> 00:10:53,045
Why
tomorrow's adventure will be all yours.

180
00:10:53,046 --> 00:10:54,548
What do you mean, Mr. Peabody?

181
00:10:54,549 --> 00:10:57,748
Do not you remember?
It's your first day at school!

182
00:10:58,058 --> 00:10:59,952
- Can I drive?
- Of course not!

183
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,398
New York-Today

184
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,999
And remember, Sherman:
Macro shortly before distracted.

185
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,025
I know, Mr. Peabody.

186
00:11:16,036 --> 00:11:19,340
And do not forget the translational status:
2 +3 = 3 +2

187
00:11:19,341 --> 00:11:21,000
I know, Mr. Peabody.

188
00:11:21,001 --> 00:11:22,236
And if you have to go toilet...

189
00:11:22,237 --> 00:11:24,768
... Proudly raised your hand,
and say, "I must go."

190
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:26,614
Okay, Mr Peabody.

191
00:11:26,615 --> 00:11:29,310
And remember, the No. 2 pencil
do most things...

192
00:11:29,311 --> 00:11:31,419
... but sometimes,
needed and the No. 1.

193
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,459
I put a small box in
Sacco your...

194
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,329
... you can use
whenever needed.

195
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,863
I think I'll be okay.

196
00:11:41,998 --> 00:11:44,266
- Well, goodbye, Mr. Peabody.
- Wait.

197
00:11:44,267 --> 00:11:45,475
'll See you after school.

198
00:11:45,476 --> 00:11:46,811
- Sherman!
- I gotta go...

199
00:11:46,812 --> 00:11:48,078
... must enroll in clubs.

200
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,252
Nobody supports more than me...

201
00:11:50,253 --> 00:11:52,673
... participation in fraternities.

202
00:11:52,674 --> 00:11:54,379
But before you go...

203
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,308
... I want you to have this.

204
00:11:56,309 --> 00:11:58,110
Thank you.
What is it?

205
00:11:58,111 --> 00:12:00,069
A dog whistle.

206
00:12:02,698 --> 00:12:06,619
Not working, Mr. Peabody.

207
00:12:07,612 --> 00:12:10,082
Works fine, Sherman.

208
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:13,582
Is simply a frequency
listening only dogs.

209
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:14,372
Good.

210
00:12:14,407 --> 00:12:16,997
Let this be a reminder for you
...

211
00:12:16,998 --> 00:12:19,362
... that whatever challenges you face
...

212
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:21,693
... however far it may seem to be at
...

213
00:12:21,694 --> 00:12:24,015
Goodbye , Mr. Peabody!

214
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:30,209
... I am near you.

215
00:12:37,016 --> 00:12:39,383
George Washington.

216
00:12:39,777 --> 00:12:41,964
Who can tell me, what is
?

217
00:12:42,017 --> 00:12:44,112
I! I can, I can!

218
00:12:44,553 --> 00:12:45,833
O. .. Sherman.

219
00:12:45,868 --> 00:12:48,992
The first president of the United States of America.

220
00:12:49,015 --> 00:12:50,196
Good job.

221
00:12:50,231 --> 00:12:53,352
And when President Washington was small
...

222
00:12:53,353 --> 00:12:55,738
... what cut tree?

223
00:12:55,802 --> 00:12:57,437
I, I! Me!

224
00:12:57,672 --> 00:12:59,488
- Penny.
- A cherry tree.

225
00:12:59,489 --> 00:13:00,441
Occult!

226
00:13:00,476 --> 00:13:01,774
What tree is this?

227
00:13:01,775 --> 00:13:04,410
There's a tree, a word:
Apokryfo.

228
00:13:04,411 --> 00:13:06,266
Means that this story is not true
.

229
00:13:06,267 --> 00:13:07,170
Seriously?

230
00:13:07,205 --> 00:13:09,883
Yes. George Washington
not ever cut cherry...

231
00:13:09,995 --> 00:13:11,687
... and never said that
can not be lying.

232
00:13:11,688 --> 00:13:12,883
People skarfistikan
these stories...

233
00:13:12,884 --> 00:13:14,822
... to learn
children a lesson about the lie.

234
00:13:14,823 --> 00:13:15,762
But it is not true.

235
00:13:15,763 --> 00:13:19,823
But he crossed the Delaware River,
Christmas 1776.

236
00:13:19,824 --> 00:13:21,614
My father went there this summer
.

237
00:13:21,615 --> 00:13:24,095
And he crossed the.
I fell into.

238
00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:28,936
It seems that someone here knows
history.

239
00:13:28,937 --> 00:13:30,684
So, Penny?

240
00:13:35,906 --> 00:13:37,637
Glad to meet you,
children.

241
00:13:37,638 --> 00:13:40,070
One day you come home to me, if you want
.

242
00:13:40,071 --> 00:13:41,568
I could fetch
my new 'model'.

243
00:13:41,569 --> 00:13:42,815
Is a hydrogen atom.

244
00:13:42,816 --> 00:13:44,961
've Only got one, right?

245
00:13:44,962 --> 00:13:47,339
Yes, you have to share.

246
00:13:48,147 --> 00:13:49,347
Good.

247
00:13:50,822 --> 00:13:52,492
Look, guys.

248
00:13:54,481 --> 00:13:58,040
What you got there, Sherman?
Herrings or crumbs?

249
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,901
Basically, I have small carrots, apple juice
...

250
00:14:00,902 --> 00:14:02,896
... and sandwiches with tuna.

251
00:14:03,638 --> 00:14:06,517
super healthy and full of vitamins.

252
00:14:06,518 --> 00:14:09,009
So eat human food, right?

253
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:10,542
Yes, why not eat?

254
00:14:10,543 --> 00:14:11,793
Because you're a dog.

255
00:14:11,794 --> 00:14:13,764
No, I'm not.
- Of course you are.

256
00:14:13,765 --> 00:14:16,002
Your father is a dog, so
and you're dog.

257
00:14:16,003 --> 00:14:18,917
I think I'm confused.
Is relative adoption.

258
00:14:18,918 --> 00:14:20,291
- Shut up, Carl.
- Well.

259
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:23,148
'll Show you. Bring.

260
00:14:24,705 --> 00:14:27,301
Go, doggy,
to get your food.

261
00:14:27,302 --> 00:14:30,157
Fuck . Go take it!

262
00:14:31,731 --> 00:14:33,292
What humiliation!

263
00:14:33,327 --> 00:14:36,071
Sherman, go get your food.

264
00:14:36,072 --> 00:14:38,711
Make like a good doggie.

265
00:14:45,816 --> 00:14:48,327
- What is it?
- Is mine. Give it back!

266
00:14:48,328 --> 00:14:51,016
What is it? Whistle?

267
00:14:52,994 --> 00:14:54,830
The stupid thing.
Not even work.

268
00:14:54,831 --> 00:14:56,071
's Whistle for dogs.

269
00:14:56,072 --> 00:14:58,612
Works at a frequency that only dogs hear.

270
00:14:58,613 --> 00:15:00,885
- Rear, Carl.
- Well.

271
00:15:00,886 --> 00:15:03,631
This whistle belongs to me.
Give me back!

272
00:15:03,632 --> 00:15:06,455
- Jump, doggy, jump!
- I'm not a dog.

273
00:15:06,456 --> 00:15:09,880
Come on, Sherman. Admit it, you're a dog
.

274
00:15:09,881 --> 00:15:11,503
- Sit down!
- Let go of me!

275
00:15:11,504 --> 00:15:14,080
Not until you beg like a dog.

276
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:17,051
Come on, Sherman. Entreat.

277
00:15:22,852 --> 00:15:24,999
Thank you for coming so soon
...

278
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,719
... to discuss the problem with
Sherman.

279
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,405
No problem, Chief Purdue
expecting this.

280
00:15:30,406 --> 00:15:31,285
Really?

281
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,122
Yes, with respect to the Sherman,
I am prepared.

282
00:15:34,123 --> 00:15:37,310
Here is a resume, showing
preparation in arithmetic...

283
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,251
... and that does not 'jump' class.

284
00:15:39,252 --> 00:15:40,135
Mr Peabody...

285
00:15:40,136 --> 00:15:42,234
Exercises
algebra and reading list...

286
00:15:42,235 --> 00:15:44,185
and a link to the Site that I made...

287
00:15:44,186 --> 00:15:46,270
... to be able to learn Chinese.

288
00:15:46,271 --> 00:15:47,818
It is the language of the future.

289
00:15:47,819 --> 00:15:48,773
Mr. Peabody!

290
00:15:48,808 --> 00:15:52,033
I'm not saying that we should learn and French,
Warden Purdue just tell...

291
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,341
Mr. Peabody!

292
00:15:53,376 --> 00:15:55,507
What? There is enough?
Swahili?

293
00:15:55,508 --> 00:15:59,447
Sherman became involved in a fight today.

294
00:15:59,616 --> 00:16:00,844
My God...

295
00:16:01,812 --> 00:16:04,963
Photographs were taken,
for safety reasons.

296
00:16:12,966 --> 00:16:15,070
Bitten.

297
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,485
I must say, it does not look good for you
, Mr. Peabody.

298
00:16:20,486 --> 00:16:22,908
After all... you dog.

299
00:16:22,909 --> 00:16:25,474
Can I ask, what are you?

300
00:16:25,475 --> 00:16:29,211
I Miss Gkranion from
Service Security and Protection of Children.

301
00:16:29,212 --> 00:16:32,748
The law requires that you call them,
happens when a...

302
00:16:32,841 --> 00:16:34,821
... episode.

303
00:16:35,263 --> 00:16:38,120
Sherman has never done before
something similar.

304
00:16:38,121 --> 00:16:39,689
I'm sure I'd have a reason.

305
00:16:39,701 --> 00:16:42,927
- The girl was a bit annoying...
- Stop, Purdue!

306
00:16:42,928 --> 00:16:46,019
It is normal road  kids tease other children
.

307
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,367
Normal road but not to bite.

308
00:16:48,368 --> 00:16:51,177
Obviously due to how it was raised.

309
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:52,140
In my opinion,

310
00:16:52,141 --> 00:16:56,135
A dog can never be
suitable parent for a child.

311
00:16:56,136 --> 00:16:57,939
I must emphasize, Miss Gkranion,

312
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:01,466
I won the right to adoption
Sherman in court.

313
00:17:01,467 --> 00:17:03,888
And the court
can you get it back!

314
00:17:04,685 --> 00:17:08,842
I'm coming home tomorrow evening, I
autopsy.

315
00:17:08,843 --> 00:17:12,354
If you discover that you are unfit to parent...

316
00:17:12,355 --> 00:17:16,098
... I will see you lose custody
Sherman.

317
00:17:21,184 --> 00:17:23,085
Permanently.

318
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,115
I hope I am clear.

319
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,628
Totally.

320
00:17:33,822 --> 00:17:36,372
Sorry for the bit,
Mr. Peabody.

321
00:17:36,373 --> 00:17:37,807
I will not do it again.

322
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:42,423
Violence of this kind is totally unacceptable
.

323
00:17:42,424 --> 00:17:46,095
And rather despicable,
based on how you feel about Mr. Gandhi.

324
00:17:46,422 --> 00:17:48,984
What the hell caused it?

325
00:17:52,213 --> 00:17:54,866
Called me a dog.

326
00:18:01,565 --> 00:18:03,098
Well.

327
00:18:06,042 --> 00:18:08,268
Thanks for telling me.

328
00:18:09,197 --> 00:18:11,543
Try to sleep.

329
00:18:15,718 --> 00:18:17,753
I love you, Mr. Peabody.

330
00:18:19,093 --> 00:18:22,024
And I have deep feelings for you,
Sherman.

331
00:20:44,136 --> 00:20:47,535
Peabody  Sir, you're a scientist
you've won the Nobel Prize.

332
00:20:47,536 --> 00:20:49,997
Among the significant country.

333
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,040
'Captain' industry.

334
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,606
Why do you want to adopt a child?

335
00:20:53,607 --> 00:20:57,478
Because, Mr. President, when I found
Sherman...

336
00:20:57,479 --> 00:21:00,663
... reminded me of how I started
in life.

337
00:21:00,914 --> 00:21:04,819
And now I want to give him
the only thing I like everything.

338
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,284
A house!

339
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:09,148
And you're sure you're capable
encounter all challenges

340
00:21:09,149 --> 00:21:11,064
upbringing of a boy?

341
00:21:11,065 --> 00:21:12,886
With all due respect...

342
00:21:12,887 --> 00:21:15,291
... how hard can it be?

343
00:21:16,302 --> 00:21:17,468
Very well, then.

344
00:21:17,503 --> 00:21:19,755
If a boy can adopt a dog...

345
00:21:19,756 --> 00:21:24,272
... I see no reason not to adopt a dog
a boy.

346
00:21:27,967 --> 00:21:31,004
- Da-da.
- No, Sherman. No, da-da.

347
00:21:31,005 --> 00:21:32,929
Call me Mr Peabody.

348
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:36,372
on more formal occasions, just
Peabody.

349
00:21:37,507 --> 00:21:38,920
Exactly.

350
00:21:39,121 --> 00:21:40,754
Lord Pimpampa.

351
00:22:22,918 --> 00:22:24,669
What cook, Mr. Peabody?

352
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:25,554
Nothing special.

353
00:22:25,555 --> 00:22:27,479
Salatoula lobster and passion fruit...

354
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,370
... And basil sauce, quail with truffle

355
00:22:29,371 --> 00:22:30,607
sauce berries, and...

356
00:22:30,608 --> 00:22:32,780
... ice cream cake.

357
00:22:32,781 --> 00:22:35,496
Celebrate something special today?

358
00:22:35,497 --> 00:22:36,484
You could tell.

359
00:22:36,485 --> 00:22:39,308
- It's my birthday.
- No, it is not.

360
00:22:39,309 --> 00:22:41,647
- Neither yours.
- Right.

361
00:22:41,648 --> 00:22:44,091
Is Father's Day?

362
00:22:44,092 --> 00:22:46,767
No, it is Father's Day.

363
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:50,507
- Does the President comes?
- No.

364
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:52,832
Then who is?

365
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:55,393
Let's just say, that if
the night a success...

366
00:22:55,394 --> 00:22:58,697
... we can forget the episode
biting.

367
00:23:05,336 --> 00:23:08,428
The Peterson!
Welcome!

368
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:10,687
- So is literally dog.
- PAUL!

369
00:23:10,688 --> 00:23:11,794
Not okay.

370
00:23:11,829 --> 00:23:14,846
If you would prefer
the "educated dog."

371
00:23:14,847 --> 00:23:17,778
Funny!
No joke, Paul?

372
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,639
Not laugh easily.

373
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,499
We were very pleased
who were able to come so quickly.

374
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,387
So, not Sherman?

375
00:23:25,499 --> 00:23:27,757
No rejoiced, Sherman?

376
00:23:27,758 --> 00:23:31,155
Yes, you will definitely know what's up.

377
00:23:31,173 --> 00:23:33,318
Greeted Penny, Sherman.

378
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:34,598
Hi, Penny.

379
00:23:34,842 --> 00:23:36,438
Hey, Sherman!

380
00:23:36,439 --> 00:23:39,873
Not going to show in Penny
your collection of minerals?

381
00:23:39,874 --> 00:23:43,600
I am sure we will find exciting new
your geodes rocks.

382
00:23:43,737 --> 00:23:45,088
Come.

383
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:50,278
Glad too
for accepting my invitation.

384
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:52,368
Now kids will be able
to settle their differences...

385
00:23:52,369 --> 00:23:54,115
... before coming Miss Gkranion.

386
00:23:54,116 --> 00:23:55,793
Shout the wrong guy, pal!

387
00:23:55,794 --> 00:23:58,746
If it was Patty,
I would have already sued.

388
00:23:58,747 --> 00:24:00,156
Gotta say, Peabody...

389
00:24:00,157 --> 00:24:03,392
regarding my daughter,
nothing is more important...

390
00:24:03,393 --> 00:24:06,171
Hello?
Yes, I will take part in polls.

391
00:24:14,656 --> 00:24:16,377
All right?

392
00:24:18,251 --> 00:24:20,049
Why do not you tell me she was coming?

393
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:22,079
Why I did not want to worry.

394
00:24:22,648 --> 00:24:25,220
Well. Because I did not want to hear the sound of
your belly.

395
00:24:25,221 --> 00:24:28,276
- Thanks for your honest.
- Please.

396
00:24:28,277 --> 00:24:31,493
I do not know what
believed that we would be together.

397
00:24:31,494 --> 00:24:32,824
Hates me!

398
00:24:32,859 --> 00:24:34,337
Share with her your interests.

399
00:24:34,338 --> 00:24:35,314
Tell her jokes.

400
00:24:35,315 --> 00:24:37,970
Mr Peabody, I hate myself.

401
00:24:37,971 --> 00:24:41,367
Sherman  every great relationship starts
-conflict...

402
00:24:41,368 --> 00:24:43,891
... and evolves into something richer.

403
00:24:44,772 --> 00:24:46,781
Good luck (in French).

404
00:24:47,429 --> 00:24:48,909
Do to succeed.

405
00:24:49,377 --> 00:24:51,437
Do not tell her about the Time Machine.

406
00:24:54,636 --> 00:24:57,618
Do not even think.

407
00:25:11,995 --> 00:25:14,391
Peabody, it was amazing!

408
00:25:14,392 --> 00:25:16,158
Paul, it was amazing?

409
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,108
I like the more rock ' n ' roll.

410
00:25:23,808 --> 00:25:25,702
Meant the flamingos.

411
00:25:31,746 --> 00:25:33,031
Bagpipe?

412
00:25:33,787 --> 00:25:36,042
Didgeridoo.
(Australian wind instrument)

413
00:25:38,677 --> 00:25:39,878
Sitar .

414
00:25:40,092 --> 00:25:41,363
Steel Drums
(drums from Trinidad).

415
00:25:41,364 --> 00:25:42,664
Trombone.

416
00:25:42,699 --> 00:25:43,968
Xylophone.

417
00:25:44,003 --> 00:25:45,203
Drum.

418
00:25:45,238 --> 00:25:46,430
Organ.

419
00:25:46,431 --> 00:25:47,224
Oboe.

420
00:25:47,259 --> 00:25:48,232
Piccolo
(small cello).

421
00:25:48,233 --> 00:25:48,773
Touba.

422
00:25:48,808 --> 00:25:49,761
Dobro
(type of guitar).

423
00:25:49,762 --> 00:25:50,535
Whistle.

424
00:25:53,935 --> 00:25:57,978
You know what?
This is a waste of time.

425
00:25:57,991 --> 00:26:00,589
To get Penny,
and go house-Wheel ..!

426
00:26:00,616 --> 00:26:02,100
Are you okay, Paul?

427
00:26:02,374 --> 00:26:04,493
I'm... well!

428
00:26:04,726 --> 00:26:06,150
This is done whenever in intensity.

429
00:26:06,151 --> 00:26:07,183
Paul, if I could...

430
00:26:07,184 --> 00:26:09,171
Stay away from me, Peabody!

431
00:26:09,172 --> 00:26:11,089
Move back!
I need stretching.

432
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:14,914
You can trust me, Paul.
I am a graduate chiropractor.

433
00:26:28,851 --> 00:26:30,176
Peabody!

434
00:26:30,211 --> 00:26:32,198
I feel great!

435
00:26:33,288 --> 00:26:35,040
I feel really great!

436
00:26:35,041 --> 00:26:37,698
Peabody, doing wonders!

437
00:26:39,021 --> 00:26:41,988
Look at me. Jig!

438
00:26:43,976 --> 00:26:44,991
You know, Penny...

439
00:26:45,026 --> 00:26:47,737
... Sigmund Freud said,
that if you do not like a person...

440
00:26:47,738 --> 00:26:51,658
... Because it reminds you of something
by yourself you do not like.

441
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:53,933
And what do you know about Sigmund Freud?

442
00:26:53,934 --> 00:26:55,035
More than you think.

443
00:26:55,036 --> 00:26:58,573
Surely . As I knew that George Washington

444
00:26:58,574 --> 00:27:00,911
not cut that cherry tree.

445
00:27:00,912 --> 00:27:03,215
- What stupidity!
- But it's true!

446
00:27:03,216 --> 00:27:04,799
- How do you know?
- I know!

447
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,573
- You read a book?
- No.

448
00:27:06,574 --> 00:27:07,781
- Did you see a movie?
- No.

449
00:27:07,782 --> 00:27:09,645
Do in said brain-father?

450
00:27:09,646 --> 00:27:10,286
No!

451
00:27:10,486 --> 00:27:11,750
Then how do you know, Sherman?

452
00:27:11,751 --> 00:27:13,279
How-to Un-carriers?

453
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,420
Told me.

454
00:27:14,455 --> 00:27:17,213
- Who told you?
- George Gouasigkton.

455
00:27:18,626 --> 00:27:21,293
George Washington.

456
00:27:21,462 --> 00:27:22,795
Yes.

457
00:27:23,506 --> 00:27:24,840
Liar.

458
00:27:27,738 --> 00:27:29,870
Do not tell her about the Time Machine.

459
00:27:31,501 --> 00:27:33,623
The saying "Time Machine".

460
00:27:33,845 --> 00:27:35,879
And what parts you go with her?

461
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,879
No where in, Penny.
In what season.

462
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,772
Well, smartass.
In what season.

463
00:27:40,773 --> 00:27:49,176
1965, 1776, 1620, 1492,
1215, 4...

464
00:27:49,177 --> 00:27:50,725
Can
go back an hour ago?

465
00:27:50,726 --> 00:27:51,341
Why?

466
00:27:51,376 --> 00:27:53,946
Why go home,
will make the sick...

467
00:27:53,947 --> 00:27:56,696
... and will not come
this stupid dinner.

468
00:27:56,697 --> 00:27:57,697
Mr. Peabody says,

469
00:27:57,698 --> 00:27:59,243
that you should not ever use the
Time Machine...

470
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:01,268
... to go at a time
existed too.

471
00:28:01,269 --> 00:28:02,112
Why?

472
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:04,338
There would be two of you then.

473
00:28:04,396 --> 00:28:07,576
Yes . I suppose that the world
still not ready for that.

474
00:28:13,451 --> 00:28:16,284
Now that we have seen,
better to go back.

475
00:28:16,285 --> 00:28:19,647
Kidding?
Where to go first?

476
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:23,273
Mr. Peabody says
not allowed to travel until you grow up.

477
00:28:23,274 --> 00:28:25,720
You're everything says Mr. Peabody?

478
00:28:25,721 --> 00:28:26,535
Yes...

479
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:29,124
You know what makes this Sherman?

480
00:28:29,151 --> 00:28:31,309
An obedient son.

481
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,400
No. A dog.

482
00:28:47,467 --> 00:28:48,872
Good move!

483
00:28:49,662 --> 00:28:50,853
Bring it, Patty.

484
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:53,523
Raised his hands, Paul!

485
00:28:53,524 --> 00:28:54,382
Here.

486
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,202
Yes!

487
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:04,884
Look at this.

488
00:29:09,036 --> 00:29:12,125
This is a homemade cocktail
I like to call:

489
00:29:12,932 --> 00:29:15,228
"O Einstein on the beach".

490
00:29:18,579 --> 00:29:21,721
- The health of children.
- Cheers to them!

491
00:29:22,513 --> 00:29:24,919
- Mr Peabody!
- Sherman?

492
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,984
I
I talk to you a minute?

493
00:29:26,985 --> 00:29:29,613
Course.
Sorry.

494
00:29:33,517 --> 00:29:35,387
I made with their parents.

495
00:29:35,388 --> 00:29:37,080
I think we
To record this night

496
00:29:37,081 --> 00:29:39,055
folder "unqualified success".

497
00:29:39,056 --> 00:29:42,461
- Do not listings yet.
- What do you mean?

498
00:29:42,462 --> 00:29:44,638
Where is Penny?

499
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,685
In Ancient Egypt...

500
00:29:46,686 --> 00:29:49,778
Use the Time Machine?

501
00:29:49,779 --> 00:29:52,411
What's up, dude?
We finish the drinks.

502
00:29:54,981 --> 00:29:57,217
Coming soon, Paul.

503
00:29:57,218 --> 00:29:59,148
How
... how could you do that?

504
00:29:59,149 --> 00:30:00,220
Called me a liar,

505
00:30:00,221 --> 00:30:03,199
Because I said that George Washington
not cut the cherry.

506
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,582
And so it went on to see
George Washington?

507
00:30:05,583 --> 00:30:06,769
Yes.

508
00:30:08,298 --> 00:30:10,735
- Hello, Peabody.
- Hello.

509
00:30:10,736 --> 00:30:12,634
- Where is Penny?
- Plays hide and seek.

510
00:30:12,635 --> 00:30:14,506
- Makes bad.
- Makes Bad...

511
00:30:14,507 --> 00:30:16,142
- And playing hide and seek.

512
00:30:16,895 --> 00:30:19,072
Well, which one Both do?

513
00:30:19,407 --> 00:30:21,153
What's going on here?

514
00:30:21,154 --> 00:30:22,687
Yeah, what's going on here?

515
00:30:22,688 --> 00:30:24,187
- What did Penny?
- Penny?

516
00:30:24,188 --> 00:30:25,705
Penny! Penny!

517
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,463
- God.
- Where is our daughter?

518
00:30:28,848 --> 00:30:30,521
It's hard to tell you, Paul...

519
00:30:30,522 --> 00:30:31,791
can be found here...

520
00:30:31,792 --> 00:30:35,801
... or here, or here, or here, or here
...

521
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,145
This will keep.

522
00:30:40,146 --> 00:30:43,030
I learned this trick from a Finnish,
in Ubud Bali.

523
00:30:43,031 --> 00:30:44,226
Let !

524
00:30:58,432 --> 00:31:01,464
Ancient Egypt!
Country Pharaoh.

525
00:31:00,465 --> 00:31:03,427
Lighthouse progress for humanity.

526
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:07,426
But also tough and barbarian culture.

527
00:31:07,687 --> 00:31:11,130
I just hope they do not suffer much
Penny.

528
00:31:23,884 --> 00:31:25,532
What are you doing here?

529
00:31:25,533 --> 00:31:27,684
We came to get you home.

530
00:31:27,796 --> 00:31:30,119
How called in Egyptian
the word 'telltale'?

531
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,431
But this is irrelevant.

532
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:34,101
Put ​​your clothes.
I get home.

533
00:31:34,102 --> 00:31:36,239
What you did your pharaoh?

534
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,151
Now bring my dresses!

535
00:31:39,243 --> 00:31:41,764
You see, Mr. Peabody?
Impossible!

536
00:31:41,765 --> 00:31:43,557
Indeed.
But look what happens...

537
00:31:43,558 --> 00:31:47,377
... when an object does not move,
meets resistance force.

538
00:31:47,378 --> 00:31:49,457
Penny, come here, right now.

539
00:31:49,458 --> 00:31:50,426
Penny, come on.

540
00:31:50,635 --> 00:31:52,766
I am no longer the Penny.

541
00:31:52,794 --> 00:31:57,117
Now I'm the princess Chatsepat,
precious flower of the Nile!

542
00:31:57,118 --> 00:31:59,430
Precious, perhaps, but if you believe that
will leave here...

543
00:31:59,431 --> 00:32:03,011
... You are definitely in denial of reality
.

544
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,806
Not understand.

545
00:32:04,841 --> 00:32:06,017
Now, come with us.

546
00:32:06,018 --> 00:32:07,415
Leave!

547
00:32:08,376 --> 00:32:11,115
What's up, my sweet, little Flower
Desert?

548
00:32:11,116 --> 00:32:13,422
barbarians
those who annoy you?

549
00:32:13,423 --> 00:32:16,089
Basically, yes.

550
00:32:16,124 --> 00:32:17,855
Bow barbarians!

551
00:32:17,856 --> 00:32:20,029
As you wish, Your Majesty.

552
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:22,129
Who is he, Mr. Peabody?

553
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:24,402
He, Sherman, is Ammon,

554
00:32:24,403 --> 00:32:26,734
dynasty of the New Kingdom...

555
00:32:26,735 --> 00:32:29,048
... King Tutankhamun.

556
00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:32,245
- Otherwise known as King TOT.
- My boy.

557
00:32:32,246 --> 00:32:35,033
King TCT is the boy?

558
00:32:35,076 --> 00:32:37,894
You want to put them scratch,
to dip in honey...

559
00:32:37,895 --> 00:32:40,525
... and put them in a pit
ants?

560
00:32:40,526 --> 00:32:42,108
Would you do this to me?

561
00:32:42,109 --> 00:32:45,787
Anything, Desert Flower.
As a wedding gift.

562
00:32:45,847 --> 00:32:49,251
- What? You marry this guy?
- Why not?

563
00:32:49,252 --> 00:32:52,136
First, his name rhymes with
'loss'.

564
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:52,876
I do not care.

565
00:32:52,911 --> 00:32:55,347
I'll do a big, rich
Egyptian wedding.

566
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,749
Warning:
O king TOT dies young.

567
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,665
Are you sure that you thought right?

568
00:32:59,666 --> 00:33:02,002
Believe me, I thought well.
'll Inherit everything.

569
00:33:02,003 --> 00:33:06,375
The royal decree was passed.
Marriage should be done tomorrow.

570
00:33:06,376 --> 00:33:07,445
Dawn.

571
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,111
- Who is he?
- It's Me.

572
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:09,971
That's you?

573
00:33:10,006 --> 00:33:12,323
I am I, the Grand Vizier.

574
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:14,572
Yes, that is his name.

575
00:33:14,573 --> 00:33:18,335
Vizier  Dude, you say
in Princess of here...

576
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:20,737
... what exactly does it mean to be married
the young pharaoh?

577
00:33:20,738 --> 00:33:21,820
Happy.

578
00:33:21,855 --> 00:33:25,279
Means that we are knit together the
eternity.

579
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:28,357
With
sacred ceremonies of the gut...

580
00:33:28,358 --> 00:33:30,130
... and mummification.

581
00:33:30,131 --> 00:33:32,768
As described in the sacred papyrus.

582
00:33:32,964 --> 00:33:36,070
A minute.
Can someone explain to me this?

583
00:33:36,071 --> 00:33:37,132
This means that, Penny,

584
00:33:37,133 --> 00:33:39,128
Is that when I die,
will kill you.

585
00:33:39,129 --> 00:33:42,111
And then I will uproot institutions,
will shove in your mouth...

586
00:33:42,112 --> 00:33:43,894
... mummification and the rest of the body.

587
00:33:43,895 --> 00:33:45,031
I get it now.

588
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:46,132
Thank you.

589
00:33:46,167 --> 00:33:48,145
'll Go with them.

590
00:33:48,352 --> 00:33:51,051
There's no turning back!

591
00:33:51,052 --> 00:33:52,149
At the Palace!

592
00:33:52,184 --> 00:33:54,610
Begin preparations wedding!

593
00:33:54,611 --> 00:33:57,757
Mr. Peabody! Sherman!
Do something!

594
00:33:57,758 --> 00:34:01,135
Do not worry, Penny,
'll save!

595
00:34:05,132 --> 00:34:07,606
Wait !
Can not we...

596
00:34:08,135 --> 00:34:09,530
... leave here.

597
00:34:10,234 --> 00:34:12,739
- Mr Peabody?
- Yes, Sherman?

598
00:34:12,841 --> 00:34:14,128
Can I Hold Your Hand?

599
00:34:14,129 --> 00:34:16,051
And of course you can.

600
00:34:16,052 --> 00:34:18,320
God. Your hand is cold,
Mr. Peabody.

601
00:34:18,321 --> 00:34:20,303
- Sherman?
- Yes?

602
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,579
This is not my hand.

603
00:34:28,784 --> 00:34:30,615
This was disarming.

604
00:34:30,616 --> 00:34:33,995
Now, to find the way to exit
...

605
00:34:34,796 --> 00:34:36,423
Look around you, Sherman.

606
00:34:36,424 --> 00:34:39,201
These tombs have been painted hieroglyphics...

607
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:41,115
... To help the souls of the Pharaoh...

608
00:34:41,116 --> 00:34:43,168
... in their journey toward reincarnation.

609
00:34:43,169 --> 00:34:46,304
And it can help us.

610
00:34:48,084 --> 00:34:49,830
This shows God Anubi,

611
00:34:49,831 --> 00:34:51,950
to drive a boat god Ra
underworld.

612
00:34:51,951 --> 00:34:55,525
Seems that boats
god Ra is the key to escaping.

613
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:57,852
We need to find them in time
to stop the wedding.

614
00:34:57,853 --> 00:35:00,711
If you ask me, you should just let
to marry this guy.

615
00:35:00,712 --> 00:35:02,024
Deserve each other.

616
00:35:02,025 --> 00:35:03,555
What you said Sherman?

617
00:35:03,556 --> 00:35:05,258
Daddy, do me a favor.

618
00:35:05,259 --> 00:35:08,569
Bald, wearing a skirt and makeup
?

619
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:11,125
If you did not know, Sherman,
I would say that you're jealous.

620
00:35:11,126 --> 00:35:12,892
Envy?
What?

621
00:35:12,893 --> 00:35:14,973
The TCT affection for Penny,
course.

622
00:35:14,974 --> 00:35:17,032
I think I like the Penny?

623
00:35:17,033 --> 00:35:19,330
Do me a favor.

624
00:35:19,331 --> 00:35:22,481
I do not want to hold the hand...

625
00:35:22,697 --> 00:35:24,443
... or going to the park...

626
00:35:24,444 --> 00:35:26,977
... or to see
brushing her hair...

627
00:35:29,924 --> 00:35:31,951
. .. or whatever...

628
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,565
Quickly, Sherman.

629
00:35:43,998 --> 00:35:47,371
Caution, Sherman.
Is mouse-trap.

630
00:35:48,302 --> 00:35:51,014
- What's so funny?
- You mouse.

631
00:35:53,077 --> 00:35:56,410
One wrong step and we pressed.

632
00:35:57,385 --> 00:35:58,730
The boat...

633
00:35:58,765 --> 00:36:00,141
... the god Ra...

634
00:36:00,142 --> 00:36:01,483
... going straight...

635
00:36:01,484 --> 00:36:02,622
... today.

636
00:36:02,657 --> 00:36:05,594
Take-error-boat...

637
00:36:05,595 --> 00:36:07,760
... people-will pay.

638
00:36:07,761 --> 00:36:09,516
Okay, Sherman,
Now it's your turn.

639
00:36:09,517 --> 00:36:12,261
Make the puzzle just like me.

640
00:36:12,262 --> 00:36:15,238
Think it well.
One step at a time.

641
00:36:22,935 --> 00:36:24,378
... I mean, 'will pay'.

642
00:36:24,379 --> 00:36:25,815
God.

643
00:36:39,464 --> 00:36:40,808
The boats of the god Ra.

644
00:36:40,809 --> 00:36:42,122
One leads to the exit...

645
00:36:42,123 --> 00:36:44,726
... while the other will send us
in darkness and in certain death.

646
00:36:44,727 --> 00:36:45,719
What?

647
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,361
Sherman, get on the boat.

648
00:36:47,362 --> 00:36:50,454
Just put together these boxes,
will move very quickly.

649
00:36:50,455 --> 00:36:53,060
- Which boat, Mr. Peabody?
- What?

650
00:36:53,061 --> 00:36:55,504
What is the boat that does not lead to certain death
?

651
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:56,771
That!

652
00:37:10,216 --> 00:37:12,811
Succeed, Sherman!
Sherman?

653
00:37:12,812 --> 00:37:14,459
Mr. Peabody!

654
00:37:14,494 --> 00:37:16,136
What are you doing over there?

655
00:37:16,137 --> 00:37:18,661
I thought you said it here.

656
00:37:43,985 --> 00:37:45,022
Sherman?

657
00:37:45,057 --> 00:37:46,305
Sherman!

658
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,553
Are you okay?

659
00:37:48,322 --> 00:37:49,618
I'm fine.

660
00:38:03,006 --> 00:38:06,901
O god, the son of Helios, Ra,
commands us to begin...

661
00:38:06,902 --> 00:38:09,639
... the sacred ceremony!

662
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:23,057
Bring the knife
for the oath of blood!

663
00:38:27,695 --> 00:38:32,700
Where the blade meets flesh,
in sacred right hand...

664
00:38:34,555 --> 00:38:38,855
... pay tribute
son of Helios, Ra.

665
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,466
Wait!

666
00:38:42,775 --> 00:38:44,906
The Anubis, the god of Death!

667
00:38:44,907 --> 00:38:47,003
The marriage must not continue!

668
00:38:47,004 --> 00:38:49,023
Why, Anubis, why?

669
00:38:49,024 --> 00:38:51,605
Wounds! Flames!

670
00:38:51,973 --> 00:38:54,409
If sealed this deal wedding...

671
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:58,003
... I will pour upon the country,
countless wounds.

672
00:38:58,004 --> 00:38:59,919
Again with wounds?

673
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,885
What I
and moved to Egypt?

674
00:39:01,886 --> 00:39:05,499
Oy vay, Anubis, o son of the sun god, Ra,
decided...

675
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:08,287
... that this girl will become
wife of the boy-king.

676
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,921
This is very funny.

677
00:39:09,922 --> 00:39:13,241
The other day I was talking to the god-son of the Sun...

678
00:39:13,242 --> 00:39:15,848
... and told me he changed his mind.

679
00:39:15,849 --> 00:39:17,050
Seriously?

680
00:39:17,311 --> 00:39:21,001
Sudden change policy we call down here to Hades.

681
00:39:21,002 --> 00:39:22,582
But it's too late.

682
00:39:22,583 --> 00:39:24,914
We have already paid the catering.

683
00:39:26,695 --> 00:39:30,152
Too bad you will lose the deposit.

684
00:39:31,886 --> 00:39:35,311
And another smoke, Sherman.
This trick works.

685
00:39:35,312 --> 00:39:38,264
Take the girl at the gates of the city...

686
00:39:38,265 --> 00:39:42,036
... And leave it there,
from where you get the gods.

687
00:39:42,807 --> 00:39:44,936
Only in thus,

688
00:39:44,937 --> 00:39:48,483
can be prevented
wounds that country.

689
00:39:49,176 --> 00:39:53,251
The Anubis spoke.

690
00:39:53,455 --> 00:39:55,869
Go this girl
at the gates!

691
00:40:02,315 --> 00:40:05,677
Anubis, you look like you're not good.

692
00:40:05,678 --> 00:40:10,166
Felt a little sick,
but I'm much better now.

693
00:40:10,818 --> 00:40:12,967
Thank you.

694
00:40:23,417 --> 00:40:25,516
Penny, Sherman quickly.

695
00:40:25,517 --> 00:40:27,941
- Come on, Penny!
- Sherman!

696
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:34,649
The bride TOSKAS!

697
00:40:34,684 --> 00:40:37,030
Stop, you fool!

698
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:58,602
Penny Sherman, climb up!

699
00:41:09,114 --> 00:41:11,084
Getting away!

700
00:41:31,624 --> 00:41:32,246
We did it!

701
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:33,905
At what time will go now,
Mr. Peabody?

702
00:41:33,906 --> 00:41:35,461
House. We have to go to the party...

703
00:41:35,462 --> 00:41:38,340
... Before parents Penny
understand that missing.

704
00:41:38,341 --> 00:41:40,574
No need to mention
all this...

705
00:41:40,575 --> 00:41:42,853
... Episode marriage with King
TOT, is not it?

706
00:41:42,854 --> 00:41:43,861
Of course not.

707
00:41:43,896 --> 00:41:45,528
Moreover, it is my opinion...

708
00:41:45,529 --> 00:41:47,787
... that marry too young
in Ancient Egypt.

709
00:41:47,788 --> 00:41:50,931
Or... maybe I'm old fashioned.

710
00:41:54,897 --> 00:41:55,909
Warning:

711
00:41:55,944 --> 00:41:58,633
Insufficient energy reserves.

712
00:41:58,634 --> 00:42:00,048
Charge now.

713
00:42:00,083 --> 00:42:02,675
What is it, Mr. Peabody?

714
00:42:02,676 --> 00:42:04,500
All this back and forth around
from the World...

715
00:42:04,501 --> 00:42:05,920
... exhausted their energy reserves.

716
00:42:05,921 --> 00:42:07,949
You must make a stop
except program.

717
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:09,439
As luck wishes...

718
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,486
... Our energy reaches barely
to the Renaissance.

719
00:42:17,957 --> 00:42:21,260
<b> Florence, Italy-1508 </ b></b>

720
00:42:24,356 --> 00:42:26,435
I can not pick,
nor the left hemisphere...

721
00:42:26,436 --> 00:42:27,969
... from right now!

722
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:30,103
How many times do I have to say,
Mona Lisa...

723
00:42:30,104 --> 00:42:31,132
Mona Lisa?

724
00:42:31,405 --> 00:42:33,037
No, no, no!

725
00:42:33,072 --> 00:42:34,879
I can not draw...

726
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,074
... if you do not smile!

727
00:42:36,075 --> 00:42:39,534
Leonardo, tell me one thing,
for which should smile!

728
00:42:39,535 --> 00:42:41,414
The  glow of the sun, spaghetti...

729
00:42:41,415 --> 00:42:45,322
... all the things that make the
so popular in Italy!

730
00:42:45,323 --> 00:42:47,674
I have not seen anything from this,
Leonardo...

731
00:42:47,675 --> 00:42:50,257
... why sit on this...
all day!

732
00:42:52,245 --> 00:42:55,086
I do not think that word means
'chair' Italian.

733
00:42:56,111 --> 00:42:58,970
Peabody, old chap!

734
00:42:58,971 --> 00:43:01,499
What a wonderful vacation!

735
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:05,105
Trust me, this woman is not
'played'.

736
00:43:05,106 --> 00:43:09,041
Well, glad to see you.
What do you want?

737
00:43:09,042 --> 00:43:10,774
Hurry
desperately to go home...

738
00:43:10,775 --> 00:43:13,072
... but Time Machine
needs energy...

739
00:43:13,073 --> 00:43:13,976
... and thought...

740
00:43:13,977 --> 00:43:16,120
... who else better there,
except by Leonardo Da Vinci...

741
00:43:16,121 --> 00:43:17,465
... To help us?

742
00:43:17,466 --> 00:43:19,897
Peabody will be happy in helping...

743
00:43:19,898 --> 00:43:22,260
... but come at a very bad time.

744
00:43:22,261 --> 00:43:26,265
I do not know what to do,
with this crazy woman.

745
00:43:26,868 --> 00:43:28,003
See what I mean?

746
00:43:28,004 --> 00:43:29,281
What is the problem?

747
00:43:29,282 --> 00:43:30,490
What is the problem.

748
00:43:30,491 --> 00:43:33,593
I can not finish the list, if not
smile.

749
00:43:33,594 --> 00:43:36,604
Okay. You smile.

750
00:43:38,379 --> 00:43:39,470
No!

751
00:43:39,505 --> 00:43:41,152
This is a fake smile!

752
00:43:41,153 --> 00:43:42,731
Everyone knows that.

753
00:43:42,732 --> 00:43:45,146
Why not do a real smile?

754
00:43:45,147 --> 00:43:46,806
Why do not you say something funny?

755
00:43:46,807 --> 00:43:50,514
I paint paintings,
construct machines...

756
00:43:50,515 --> 00:43:52,986
... but not telling jokes!

757
00:43:52,987 --> 00:43:55,389
Maybe I can help.

758
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:58,298
You see, humor is immune
loss of science.

759
00:43:58,299 --> 00:44:00,184
Using algorithms, we can conclude
...

760
00:44:00,185 --> 00:44:02,229
... what is considered funny
worldwide.

761
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:03,807
So we make a 'recipe'...

762
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:06,796
... that is scientifically sure that
lark.

763
00:44:06,797 --> 00:44:09,738
For example, the drape.

764
00:44:15,086 --> 00:44:17,057
Entertain you?

765
00:44:20,581 --> 00:44:22,872
The evidence was so clear...

766
00:44:23,084 --> 00:44:24,298
Do not worry, Mr Peabody,
I have!

767
00:44:24,299 --> 00:44:25,557
No, no, Sherman...

768
00:44:39,405 --> 00:44:42,699
Perfect!
Keep that smile!

769
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:44,812
Hold it there!
Do not move!

770
00:44:52,311 --> 00:44:55,293
Well, Leo, if correct
my calculations...

771
00:44:55,294 --> 00:44:58,447
... This machine will produce
enough power to get home.

772
00:44:58,448 --> 00:45:01,511
I have a
last piece to be put in place.

773
00:45:01,512 --> 00:45:04,806
Sherman, you can bring the hammer
by Mr. Da Vinci?

774
00:45:04,834 --> 00:45:07,145
Okay, Mr. Peabody.

775
00:45:12,041 --> 00:45:14,055
- Mr Peabody?
- Very good, Sherman.

776
00:45:14,056 --> 00:45:15,624
But Mr Peabody...!

777
00:45:15,625 --> 00:45:17,841
Helped me a lot.

778
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:32,458
Sherman!

779
00:45:33,014 --> 00:45:34,778
Yes, Mr. Peabody?

780
00:45:35,376 --> 00:45:38,774
Hammer...
the main Da Vinci?

781
00:45:39,189 --> 00:45:40,968
Okay, Mr. Peabody.

782
00:45:44,589 --> 00:45:45,909
Here, Mr Da Vinci.

783
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,125
Need Help?

784
00:45:47,126 --> 00:45:50,588
No, no, I'm fine.
Thanks.

785
00:45:51,429 --> 00:45:52,611
Sherman!

786
00:45:52,904 --> 00:45:55,363
Go.
Let's explore.

787
00:45:56,543 --> 00:45:59,882
Supposedly we
time father-son, with Mr. Peabody.

788
00:45:59,883 --> 00:46:02,709
Would not you rather have fun with me?

789
00:46:03,536 --> 00:46:04,617
Well.

790
00:46:04,652 --> 00:46:06,459
Sherman!
Where are you going?

791
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:08,198
Exploring.

792
00:46:08,406 --> 00:46:10,508
- But we need your help.
- No, I do not need it.

793
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:13,971
I mean, will succeed,
somehow.

794
00:46:13,972 --> 00:46:15,528
It's a boy, Peabody.

795
00:46:15,529 --> 00:46:18,164
Aston entertain.
Let him go.

796
00:46:18,165 --> 00:46:20,665
Thank you, Mr. Peabody.

797
00:46:23,293 --> 00:46:26,042
Grows, Peabody.

798
00:46:26,043 --> 00:46:29,168
Like a little bird,
leaving the nest.

799
00:46:29,205 --> 00:46:32,079
It is not wonderful?

800
00:46:38,681 --> 00:46:41,319
It's like a museum.

801
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:44,312
It's like toy store.

802
00:46:54,362 --> 00:46:55,672
Look at this.

803
00:46:55,707 --> 00:46:58,694
It is the largest airplane-model
®.

804
00:46:58,695 --> 00:47:01,775
There is a model, Penny,
is original.

805
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:04,557
And
probably best to leave it alone.

806
00:47:04,558 --> 00:47:05,444
Well.

807
00:47:05,479 --> 00:47:07,585
But it would be nice if
could fly with it?

808
00:47:07,586 --> 00:47:09,605
I do not think it would appeal to Mr Peabody
.

809
00:47:09,606 --> 00:47:11,653
Mr. Peabody is not here yet.

810
00:47:11,654 --> 00:47:13,828
Just tell me how it works.

811
00:47:13,895 --> 00:47:15,109
Please!

812
00:47:15,144 --> 00:47:16,323
To learn.

813
00:47:16,924 --> 00:47:18,010
Okay.

814
00:47:18,045 --> 00:47:21,919
Starting at this point...

815
00:47:22,001 --> 00:47:24,232
... and then proceeds
in this corridor...

816
00:47:24,233 --> 00:47:26,200
... until you shake the wind sails.

817
00:47:26,201 --> 00:47:28,043
But how it goes?

818
00:47:28,044 --> 00:47:30,099
How  takeoff?

819
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,509
Just you download this driver.

820
00:47:33,446 --> 00:47:34,825
Him?

821
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:36,205
God.

822
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:46,152
This is crazy!

823
00:47:46,451 --> 00:47:48,721
There is Sherman.
It's fun!

824
00:47:48,722 --> 00:47:50,148
'll Die!

825
00:47:50,452 --> 00:47:53,228
Stop being so funky.

826
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:01,560
Nothing is more beautiful...

827
00:48:01,561 --> 00:48:05,436
... as an elegant equation,
translated into flawless mechanics.

828
00:48:05,437 --> 00:48:08,041
Why are not children and
so simple?

829
00:48:08,042 --> 00:48:10,810
Because children are not machines,
Peabody.

830
00:48:10,811 --> 00:48:14,078
Trust me .
I tried to build one.

831
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,951
It was scary.

832
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:20,640
Here, Sherman.
Drove you now.

833
00:48:20,641 --> 00:48:21,854
But I do not want to drive it.

834
00:48:21,855 --> 00:48:23,981
And of course you want.
Will be fun!

835
00:48:23,982 --> 00:48:26,751
Honestly, Penny, I do not want.

836
00:48:26,752 --> 00:48:28,370
I leave.

837
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:29,931
- One... two...
- Do not let go!

838
00:48:29,932 --> 00:48:32,909
- Not!
-... Three!

839
00:48:35,335 --> 00:48:37,008
Penny, fly high!

840
00:48:37,261 --> 00:48:39,906
No, Sherman,
you tried to save it.

841
00:48:39,907 --> 00:48:41,212
But I can not.

842
00:48:41,247 --> 00:48:43,906
'm Serious, Penny.
Do not know how to fly!

843
00:48:43,907 --> 00:48:46,021
You can do it.
I know you can.

844
00:48:46,022 --> 00:48:49,121
Come on, Sherman.
Take the wheel.

845
00:49:14,708 --> 00:49:17,273
See? You did, Sherman

846
00:49:17,274 --> 00:49:19,907
You're right.
I did!

847
00:49:27,124 --> 00:49:29,630
Mamas once!
The Da Vinci did it again the miracle.

848
00:49:29,631 --> 00:49:32,958
Yes, but look at the child who made it.
Very scary.

849
00:49:32,959 --> 00:49:35,024
Dad. Dad.

850
00:50:03,791 --> 00:50:05,575
I finished up here, Leonardo.

851
00:50:05,576 --> 00:50:07,670
And I'm done down here.

852
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,844
Not beautiful?

853
00:50:09,845 --> 00:50:11,130
Each piece in place...

854
00:50:11,131 --> 00:50:14,101
... To do exactly what you need.

855
00:50:14,113 --> 00:50:17,890
Look, Peabody!
The fly my bike!

856
00:50:17,891 --> 00:50:19,276
Fly my camera!

857
00:50:19,277 --> 00:50:21,336
Sherman? Sherman!

858
00:50:21,579 --> 00:50:23,877
Sherman, what are you doing up there?

859
00:50:23,878 --> 00:50:25,485
I'm flying!

860
00:50:25,729 --> 00:50:28,182
But Sherman does not know how to fly.

861
00:50:28,183 --> 00:50:30,584
- I do not know?
- No.

862
00:50:36,893 --> 00:50:41,218
Turn. Turn, Sherman.
Lean!

863
00:50:55,275 --> 00:50:58,678
Sherman! Sherman!
Are you okay?

864
00:50:58,691 --> 00:51:01,181
It was fantastic!

865
00:51:02,191 --> 00:51:04,740
I can not believe it!

866
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:08,150
Fly my camera worked!

867
00:51:08,693 --> 00:51:11,644
Sherman, you're the first
flying man!

868
00:51:11,645 --> 00:51:14,562
You should be very proud,
Peabody!

869
00:51:14,563 --> 00:51:16,377
Very very proud.

870
00:51:16,378 --> 00:51:18,931
The word 'proud'
not enough to describe it.

871
00:51:20,167 --> 00:51:23,687
Leonardo , you can start
mechanism?

872
00:51:41,693 --> 00:51:43,138
Dad, Dad!

873
00:51:45,481 --> 00:51:46,920
Mona!

874
00:51:48,568 --> 00:51:50,764
Dad, Dad!

875
00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:19,740
I'm sorry I destroyed the plane, Mr. Peabody.

876
00:52:19,741 --> 00:52:21,120
Should be sorry.

877
00:52:21,121 --> 00:52:22,385
You could have been killed.

878
00:52:22,386 --> 00:52:25,469
What you say now?
Sherman led plane.

879
00:52:25,470 --> 00:52:26,932
It was fantastic!

880
00:52:26,933 --> 00:52:30,475
Sherman destroyed a priceless historical relic
.

881
00:52:30,492 --> 00:52:32,924
Any rate.
Should rejoice.

882
00:52:32,925 --> 00:52:35,416
It turns out that
Sherman is not completely lost after all.

883
00:52:35,417 --> 00:52:36,533
Yes, Mr. Peabody.

884
00:52:36,534 --> 00:52:40,313
Turns out that I'm not completely lost after all.

885
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:42,315
Miss Peterson...

886
00:52:42,316 --> 00:52:44,996
... Stop drift my son
become hooligans.

887
00:52:44,997 --> 00:52:46,786
Not my fault they are hooligans.

888
00:52:46,787 --> 00:52:49,290
Yes. Not his fault that I'm
hooligans.

889
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:50,687
Certainly not my fault, too.

890
00:52:50,688 --> 00:52:52,015
I spent the last 7 years...

891
00:52:52,016 --> 00:52:53,852
... teaching the Sherman
have good judgment.

892
00:52:53,853 --> 00:52:55,038
If you are so awesome father,

893
00:52:55,039 --> 00:52:58,698
why trying Miss Gkranion
get you the Sherman?

894
00:53:00,454 --> 00:53:02,072
Is this true?

895
00:53:02,073 --> 00:53:04,137
You'll get someone away from you?

896
00:53:04,138 --> 00:53:06,698
No, Sherman.
I will never let that happen.

897
00:53:06,699 --> 00:53:08,932
You only have to trust me.

898
00:53:08,933 --> 00:53:11,317
Panagia mou, a Black Hole!

899
00:53:16,542 --> 00:53:18,021
What happens?

900
00:53:18,056 --> 00:53:19,618
If I can not pull us out of here
...

901
00:53:19,619 --> 00:53:23,355
... will break the
event horizon of the black hole.

902
00:53:27,661 --> 00:53:30,689
No
have enough strength to resist the attractive force.

903
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:32,647
Even if you burn everything...

904
00:53:33,296 --> 00:53:34,630
Why do not you tell me?

905
00:53:34,631 --> 00:53:35,639
What can I say?

906
00:53:35,674 --> 00:53:38,695
Why do not you tell me that Miss Gkranion
was trying to get away from you?

907
00:53:38,696 --> 00:53:40,901
Not
job to worry about these things.

908
00:53:40,902 --> 00:53:42,903
Just do not think I can cope
...

909
00:53:42,904 --> 00:53:44,871
This will be discussed later.
Now sit down.

910
00:53:44,872 --> 00:53:47,327
I do not want to discuss it later!

911
00:53:47,328 --> 00:53:48,653
Sherman, sat.

912
00:53:48,688 --> 00:53:50,767
You can not talk to me
thereby.

913
00:53:50,768 --> 00:53:52,182
I'm not a dog.

914
00:53:52,183 --> 00:53:53,353
What?

915
00:53:53,388 --> 00:53:56,445
I said I'm not dog!

916
00:53:56,446 --> 00:53:58,937
You're right, Sherman,
're not.

917
00:53:58,938 --> 00:54:01,661
're Just a very naughty boy.

918
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:07,734
10, 9, 8, 7, 6...

919
00:54:07,769 --> 00:54:13,842
... 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

920
00:54:28,047 --> 00:54:30,846
Sherman? Penny?

921
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:33,668
Sherman, are you okay?

922
00:54:36,033 --> 00:54:37,864
Sherman?

923
00:54:44,824 --> 00:54:46,363
Gone.

924
00:54:46,746 --> 00:54:48,512
Where are we?

925
00:54:49,818 --> 00:54:51,431
No.

926
00:54:51,704 --> 00:54:55,369
We are on the brink
one of the most brutal conflicts in history.

927
00:54:58,147 --> 00:55:02,255
<b> Trojan War-1184 BC </ b></b>

928
00:55:19,706 --> 00:55:22,374
How we are heroes of Greece?

929
00:55:22,375 --> 00:55:25,961
Feel good?
Feel strong?

930
00:55:26,768 --> 00:55:28,299
Okay, let's warm,

931
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:30,470
if we are to succeed
something out there.

932
00:55:30,471 --> 00:55:35,184
Remember what happened to Achilles,
and note well.

933
00:55:36,356 --> 00:55:38,050
You look fine, Diomedes.

934
00:55:38,051 --> 00:55:40,684
Menelaus, dude!

935
00:55:40,692 --> 00:55:41,774
Dude.

936
00:55:41,809 --> 00:55:44,245
Ready to enter the battle,
Sermanous?

937
00:55:44,246 --> 00:55:47,455
And of course, sir Agamemnon!

938
00:55:47,795 --> 00:55:49,165
Very sweet.

939
00:55:53,974 --> 00:55:57,343
Messenger, what news you bring?

940
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,046
Someone left this for us.

941
00:55:59,047 --> 00:56:00,612
Gift, nice!

942
00:56:00,647 --> 00:56:03,558
Seems  same as our own horse.

943
00:56:04,141 --> 00:56:06,286
To bring it in?

944
00:56:07,209 --> 00:56:09,189
Why not?

945
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:16,394
Not expecting this.

946
00:56:17,022 --> 00:56:20,400
My Lady!
What is that smell?

947
00:56:22,597 --> 00:56:25,403
This is the smell of victory!

948
00:56:26,315 --> 00:56:29,317
Hello, men of Athens,
Sparta and Thebes.

949
00:56:29,318 --> 00:56:32,643
I am the Peabody.
I came to Sherman.

950
00:56:32,644 --> 00:56:33,646
Do you know this guy?

951
00:56:33,647 --> 00:56:36,116
I thought I knew,
but I'm not sure anymore.

952
00:56:36,117 --> 00:56:38,818
Then  must be a spy.
Kill him!

953
00:56:39,047 --> 00:56:40,987
No, no!

954
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:43,498
Is... my father.

955
00:56:43,499 --> 00:56:44,795
Your father?

956
00:56:45,013 --> 00:56:47,066
Are adopted.

957
00:56:47,902 --> 00:56:52,637
Thank you
took care of my son, Agamemnon...

958
00:56:52,638 --> 00:56:55,040
... But it's time to go home
.

959
00:56:55,041 --> 00:56:57,403
Sorry, Mr Peabody,
I entered the Greek army.

960
00:56:57,404 --> 00:56:58,968
The Sermanous is one of us now.

961
00:56:58,969 --> 00:57:00,499
- It's brother.
- I am a brother.

962
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:01,527
Is my son!

963
00:57:01,528 --> 00:57:03,170
- Gave oath!
- I gave an oath.

964
00:57:03,171 --> 00:57:04,362
Is seven years!

965
00:57:04,585 --> 00:57:06,135
Seven and a half!

966
00:57:06,348 --> 00:57:10,338
All sons must show
deserve what their fathers.

967
00:57:10,339 --> 00:57:14,826
Today,
Sermanous will show what it is worth on the battlefield.

968
00:57:14,827 --> 00:57:16,156
But it  child.

969
00:57:16,419 --> 00:57:17,625
Your father can not believe

970
00:57:17,626 --> 00:57:19,690
you're ready to become a man,
Sermanous...

971
00:57:19,691 --> 00:57:21,443
... but we believe.

972
00:57:21,444 --> 00:57:22,724
Yes, Mr. Peabody.

973
00:57:22,725 --> 00:57:24,511
Now
I will show you what I can bear.

974
00:57:24,512 --> 00:57:26,135
FYI...

975
00:57:26,136 --> 00:57:27,410
... all heroes have problems
with their father.

976
00:57:27,411 --> 00:57:30,195
My father is a Minotaur.
Half man-half bull.

977
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:31,709
All  review.

978
00:57:31,942 --> 00:57:34,031
Ajax from here,
is the strongest man in the world...

979
00:57:34,032 --> 00:57:35,535
... but his father never accepted...

980
00:57:35,536 --> 00:57:38,008
... that his real dream was to sing
.

981
00:57:38,009 --> 00:57:39,606
I wanted to go to 'dance'.

982
00:57:39,607 --> 00:57:42,024
And let's not begin to tell
for Oedipus.

983
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:42,903
Only say,

984
00:57:42,938 --> 00:57:45,950
do not want to do
vacation home.

985
00:57:45,951 --> 00:57:47,331
Is difficult.

986
00:57:47,584 --> 00:57:49,643
Sherman,
worried that you have not thought well.

987
00:57:49,644 --> 00:57:50,715
Here is a war.

988
00:57:50,716 --> 00:57:52,706
Realize what's going to happen?

989
00:57:52,707 --> 00:57:54,819
I'll tell you what's going to happen
.

990
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:57,163
Will destroy their homes...

991
00:57:57,194 --> 00:57:58,493
... will demolish their temples...

992
00:57:58,494 --> 00:58:00,856
... And paint red
the city streets!

993
00:58:00,857 --> 00:58:04,143
With Trojan blood!

994
00:58:04,178 --> 00:58:05,602
Yes!

995
00:58:05,637 --> 00:58:08,946
Blood, blood, blood!

996
00:58:18,916 --> 00:58:20,519
Attack 3!
1...

997
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:23,188
Sherman,
explicitly forbid you to fight in the Trojan War.

998
00:58:23,189 --> 00:58:26,133
Not fair!
All my friends will fight.

999
00:58:26,134 --> 00:58:27,051
2...

1000
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:29,264
- Sherman is dangerous!
- I wear a helmet.

1001
00:58:29,265 --> 00:58:30,564
-3!
- There you go!

1002
00:58:30,565 --> 00:58:32,171
'll Go.

1003
00:58:32,206 --> 00:58:33,777
Storming!

1004
00:58:38,935 --> 00:58:42,605
Eat my ash,
dogs of Troy!

1005
00:58:44,210 --> 00:58:47,390
Eat  ash my dog
Troy!

1006
00:58:59,624 --> 00:59:01,158
Despite hair.

1007
00:59:03,218 --> 00:59:06,138
That's why I'm asking you to obey me,
Sherman.

1008
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,379
Because I'm your father.

1009
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:11,204
And
is my job to protect you.

1010
00:59:12,105 --> 00:59:15,352
Are you sure  But
that will not get me Miss Gkranion?

1011
00:59:16,616 --> 00:59:19,179
Not while I exist.

1012
00:59:31,154 --> 00:59:33,882
Mr Peabody, help!

1013
00:59:34,098 --> 00:59:35,235
Penny!

1014
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:46,127
Smell my victory!
Smell it!

1015
00:59:47,386 --> 00:59:49,409
This is my horse!

1016
00:59:55,830 --> 00:59:58,070
Mr Peabody  fast!

1017
01:00:00,773 --> 01:00:02,022
I'll take it.

1018
01:00:49,962 --> 01:00:51,510
Did it, Sherman!

1019
01:00:51,511 --> 01:00:52,924
Help Mr. Peabody.

1020
01:00:52,925 --> 01:00:54,642
Now, let's get
in Time Machine...

1021
01:00:54,643 --> 01:00:55,958
... go back
to wake her parents Penny...

1022
01:00:55,959 --> 01:00:57,914
... Finish that party
to eat my ice cream cake...

1023
01:00:57,915 --> 01:00:59,288
... to cut the air in Miss Gkranion...

1024
01:00:59,289 --> 01:01:01,622
... and make sure that nothing
ever happened.

1025
01:01:01,623 --> 01:01:02,809
Sounds good.

1026
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:06,016
I am inside.

1027
01:01:10,293 --> 01:01:10,650
Sherman !

1028
01:01:11,514 --> 01:01:12,189
Penny!

1029
01:01:12,224 --> 01:01:13,991
Sherman, no!

1030
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:33,695
Mr Peabody...

1031
01:01:34,284 --> 01:01:36,011
Mr Peabody?

1032
01:01:37,286 --> 01:01:39,257
Mr. Peabody!

1033
01:01:43,993 --> 01:01:45,611
Dad!

1034
01:01:56,045 --> 01:02:00,003
Mr Peabody, what would you do?
What should I do?

1035
01:02:03,009 --> 01:02:05,732
There is nothing you can do, Sherman.

1036
01:02:09,155 --> 01:02:10,705
I just want to go home...

1037
01:02:12,590 --> 01:02:13,852
Home?

1038
01:02:15,002 --> 01:02:16,352
This is it!

1039
01:02:16,923 --> 01:02:18,448
I have an idea.

1040
01:02:18,957 --> 01:02:20,154
Come!

1041
01:02:22,219 --> 01:02:23,569
Where to go?

1042
01:02:23,604 --> 01:02:24,884
Coming home.

1043
01:02:24,919 --> 01:02:26,840
There
only one person who can help us...

1044
01:02:26,841 --> 01:02:28,839
... and this is the main Peabody.

1045
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:30,703
What are you talking about?
This is not possible.

1046
01:02:30,704 --> 01:02:32,498
We have Time Machine,
Penny.

1047
01:02:32,499 --> 01:02:34,437
Can I configure
to reach home...

1048
01:02:34,438 --> 01:02:36,307
... that is still
Mr. Peabody.

1049
01:02:36,308 --> 01:02:39,398
But I thought I should
to travel in time existed.

1050
01:02:39,399 --> 01:02:41,412
We have no choice.

1051
01:02:41,775 --> 01:02:42,973
FALSE

1052
01:02:43,008 --> 01:02:46,218
Try to go at a time
that exist.

1053
01:02:46,219 --> 01:02:49,320
This could change
texture of spacetime.

1054
01:02:49,321 --> 01:02:50,956
FALSE

1055
01:02:53,491 --> 01:02:54,459
Hold on!

1056
01:03:07,266 --> 01:03:10,275
This is a homemade cocktail
I like to call:

1057
01:03:11,242 --> 01:03:13,919
"O Einstein on the beach".

1058
01:03:16,548 --> 01:03:19,727
- The health of children.
- Cheers to them!

1059
01:03:20,629 --> 01:03:22,251
Mr. Peabody!

1060
01:03:22,286 --> 01:03:23,839
Sherman? Penny?

1061
01:03:23,874 --> 01:03:25,710
Can you say then?

1062
01:03:25,711 --> 01:03:27,704
Course.
Sorry.

1063
01:03:30,253 --> 01:03:32,000
I made with their parents.

1064
01:03:32,001 --> 01:03:33,432
I think we
To record this night

1065
01:03:33,433 --> 01:03:35,466
folder "unqualified success".

1066
01:03:35,467 --> 01:03:39,004
- Do not listings yet.
- What do you mean?

1067
01:03:39,005 --> 01:03:41,034
Why are you dressed like ancient...

1068
01:03:41,035 --> 01:03:42,960
... Greeks?
Use a camera!

1069
01:03:42,961 --> 01:03:44,851
I did.
I know it's awful.

1070
01:03:44,852 --> 01:03:45,850
But why?

1071
01:03:45,885 --> 01:03:47,904
Disagreed with Penny
to George Washington.

1072
01:03:47,905 --> 01:03:49,889
And I made him show me
the Time Machine.

1073
01:03:49,890 --> 01:03:51,172
And lost in Ancient Egypt.

1074
01:03:51,173 --> 01:03:52,402
And betrothed King TCT.

1075
01:03:52,403 --> 01:03:53,597
So I came back and got
like you.

1076
01:03:53,598 --> 01:03:54,453
So we stayed out of fuel.

1077
01:03:54,454 --> 01:03:55,186
In Florence.

1078
01:03:55,221 --> 01:03:56,086
And we fell into a black hole.

1079
01:03:56,087 --> 01:03:57,723
And then you died
Ancient Troy.

1080
01:03:57,724 --> 01:03:58,586
Died?

1081
01:03:58,621 --> 01:03:59,946
I find it hard to believe that.

1082
01:03:59,947 --> 01:04:00,890
True!

1083
01:04:00,925 --> 01:04:03,152
But now you're here,
and everything will be fine!

1084
01:04:03,153 --> 01:04:05,908
I told you never to
prancing around in time when there were...

1085
01:04:05,909 --> 01:04:07,287
... because there will be two yourself.

1086
01:04:07,288 --> 01:04:10,273
Yes, but my other self
is in Ancient Egypt.

1087
01:04:14,704 --> 01:04:15,772
Who are you?

1088
01:04:15,807 --> 01:04:17,608
It's you, but from another era.

1089
01:04:17,609 --> 01:04:20,814
But I thought you said, not
never go back to that era existed.

1090
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:22,135
Exactly!

1091
01:04:22,170 --> 01:04:24,889
I know, I know.
But what could I do?

1092
01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:27,289
Mr. Peabody died
Ancient Troy.

1093
01:04:27,290 --> 01:04:29,654
Die?
I find it hard to believe that.

1094
01:04:29,655 --> 01:04:30,926
Thank you!

1095
01:04:30,961 --> 01:04:32,162
What would you do?

1096
01:04:32,197 --> 01:04:34,862
In principle, can not stay here
both Sherman.

1097
01:04:34,863 --> 01:04:36,242
Why? We can take bunk!

1098
01:04:36,243 --> 01:04:37,453
And I was thinking the same!

1099
01:04:37,454 --> 01:04:39,463
Strange! Gemini!

1100
01:04:39,464 --> 01:04:41,647
And I was thinking it!

1101
01:04:41,648 --> 01:04:42,392
Viewing?

1102
01:04:42,427 --> 01:04:44,536
We can not have two Sherman
the same period.

1103
01:04:44,537 --> 01:04:47,624
Puts excessive pressure on the continuity of spacetime.

1104
01:04:47,625 --> 01:04:49,539
What to do?
What to do...

1105
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:51,866
The Peterson
can not learn anything from all of them.

1106
01:04:52,007 --> 01:04:54,960
- Hello, Peabody!
- Hello!

1107
01:04:54,961 --> 01:04:55,944
How's it going?

1108
01:04:55,979 --> 01:04:58,715
Penny too hungry.

1109
01:04:58,716 --> 01:05:01,508
The
smells coming from the kitchen is wonderful!

1110
01:05:01,509 --> 01:05:03,665
Especially  that the ice cream cake!

1111
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:05,527
Yeah... So, what's going on here?

1112
01:05:05,528 --> 01:05:07,355
Yes, what are these cloaks?

1113
01:05:07,356 --> 01:05:09,622
Party with togas!

1114
01:05:09,694 --> 01:05:11,063
Party with togas?

1115
01:05:11,064 --> 01:05:14,464
Yes, it's a party with togas!

1116
01:05:14,465 --> 01:05:16,397
And the food?
Starving.

1117
01:05:16,398 --> 01:05:18,260
Why not go to the dining room...

1118
01:05:18,261 --> 01:05:20,305
... try those quail
we advertise?

1119
01:05:20,306 --> 01:05:21,928
- Not!
- Why not?

1120
01:05:21,929 --> 01:05:25,938
Because... it's so fun here.

1121
01:05:35,292 --> 01:05:36,621
Miss  Gkranion !

1122
01:05:37,461 --> 01:05:39,232
What a pleasant surprise!

1123
01:05:39,233 --> 01:05:41,615
We were having so nice,
I forgot that you would come.

1124
01:05:41,616 --> 01:05:43,551
Why not come to the party?

1125
01:05:43,552 --> 01:05:45,241
I did not come here to party!

1126
01:05:45,242 --> 01:05:47,131
I came to research.

1127
01:05:47,132 --> 01:05:50,668
Nice! Why not start your search
from there?

1128
01:05:50,669 --> 01:05:53,804
Or here... or here... or here...

1129
01:05:53,805 --> 01:05:56,702
stop fro
shake your hands!

1130
01:05:58,234 --> 01:05:59,211
Sherman?

1131
01:05:59,246 --> 01:06:01,092
Wait!
This is not...

1132
01:06:01,093 --> 01:06:02,383
-... Sherman!

1133
01:06:02,418 --> 01:06:07,146
Two  Sherman?
What is going on here, Peabody?

1134
01:06:09,595 --> 01:06:10,988
Do not shake it!

1135
01:06:10,989 --> 01:06:12,970
Sherman, should get you out of here
...

1136
01:06:12,971 --> 01:06:15,292
... before you touch yourself.

1137
01:06:16,198 --> 01:06:18,595
Mr Peabody, not dead!

1138
01:06:18,596 --> 01:06:21,819
- Of course not died!
- Thanks!

1139
01:06:21,941 --> 01:06:23,950
How I came back eventually?

1140
01:06:23,951 --> 01:06:25,320
After some failed experiments...

1141
01:06:25,321 --> 01:06:27,708
... Got a combination of bone, stone and
fat yak (bovine type)...

1142
01:06:27,709 --> 01:06:29,654
... And I built a rudimentary
Time Machine.

1143
01:06:29,655 --> 01:06:31,015
You know what they say...

1144
01:06:31,016 --> 01:06:34,091
... if you do not succeed at first,
try, and try again.

1145
01:06:34,092 --> 01:06:35,968
Now is not the time for
puns!

1146
01:06:35,969 --> 01:06:37,420
Even if they are good.

1147
01:06:37,421 --> 01:06:39,237
Penny, Sherman quickly.

1148
01:06:39,238 --> 01:06:40,984
I will not go anywhere.

1149
01:06:40,985 --> 01:06:42,724
I saw enough to get
child...

1150
01:06:42,725 --> 01:06:45,990
... and two children,
of this house.

1151
01:06:45,991 --> 01:06:47,518
No, do not!

1152
01:06:47,519 --> 01:06:50,433
Miss Gkranion  please!
All my fault.

1153
01:06:50,434 --> 01:06:52,737
I started it.

1154
01:06:52,970 --> 01:06:55,470
I'm so sorry, Sherman.

1155
01:06:56,142 --> 01:06:58,702
No need to apologize, Penny.

1156
01:06:58,703 --> 01:07:02,206
Should not be allowed to adopt a dog
child anyway.

1157
01:07:02,207 --> 01:07:05,545
- Now, let's go!
- Madam Gkranion, beware!

1158
01:07:06,774 --> 01:07:08,388
What happens?

1159
01:07:13,199 --> 01:07:14,419
Mr. Peabody!

1160
01:07:15,308 --> 01:07:16,698
Sherman?

1161
01:07:30,830 --> 01:07:33,210
Where did the other two?

1162
01:07:33,624 --> 01:07:35,172
The secular  impersonators joined us,

1163
01:07:35,173 --> 01:07:39,343
to 'correct'
continuity in time and space.

1164
01:07:40,078 --> 01:07:42,021
Okay, makes sense.

1165
01:07:42,146 --> 01:07:46,952
I do not know what just happened,
but I know it was wrong!

1166
01:07:46,953 --> 01:07:48,660
This boy will come with me!

1167
01:07:48,661 --> 01:07:49,409
Mr. Peabody!

1168
01:07:49,444 --> 01:07:50,878
- No, Miss Gkranion!
- Leave me!

1169
01:07:50,879 --> 01:07:52,223
Come here!

1170
01:07:52,765 --> 01:07:54,924
With it hurts!

1171
01:08:03,030 --> 01:08:04,673
Bit me!

1172
01:08:05,592 --> 01:08:07,975
Bit me!

1173
01:08:08,953 --> 01:08:10,922
Yes, Hello, police?

1174
01:08:10,923 --> 01:08:12,680
I want to report an assault.

1175
01:08:12,681 --> 01:08:14,010
One bite!

1176
01:08:14,045 --> 01:08:15,912
Mr Peabody, what would you do?

1177
01:08:15,913 --> 01:08:17,946
Exactly.
Come as fast as you can.

1178
01:08:17,947 --> 01:08:19,302
Run!

1179
01:08:19,516 --> 01:08:21,890
Kidnaps the kid!

1180
01:08:24,057 --> 01:08:26,280
I can not believe that the
bit me, Mr. Peabody.

1181
01:08:26,281 --> 01:08:28,052
I know, Sherman was wrong.

1182
01:08:28,053 --> 01:08:30,860
False? It was awesome!

1183
01:08:31,396 --> 01:08:33,344
And now to return to normal
nowadays...

1184
01:08:33,345 --> 01:08:35,288
... will fix this mess.

1185
01:08:38,631 --> 01:08:39,489
There he is!

1186
01:08:39,524 --> 01:08:42,674
Keeps my daughter,
in this gigantic space apple!

1187
01:08:49,209 --> 01:08:51,514
Numb my face.

1188
01:08:56,049 --> 01:08:57,453
What?

1189
01:09:01,820 --> 01:09:03,761
Time Travel failed.

1190
01:09:03,762 --> 01:09:04,580
My God...

1191
01:09:04,615 --> 01:09:06,371
What is it, Mr. Peabody?

1192
01:09:06,372 --> 01:09:09,960
The secular  our impersonators opened hole
then spacetime.

1193
01:09:09,961 --> 01:09:12,366
This is why we went there in the past.

1194
01:09:15,426 --> 01:09:17,704
Hi, Peabody!

1195
01:09:17,705 --> 01:09:20,209
It seems that the past
comes to us.

1196
01:09:22,351 --> 01:09:26,092
I'll get you!
No exception!

1197
01:09:28,431 --> 01:09:30,655
Penny, my bride!

1198
01:09:34,115 --> 01:09:35,292
What?

1199
01:09:37,853 --> 01:09:39,464
My Lady!

1200
01:09:48,510 --> 01:09:50,106
Follow this boat.

1201
01:10:03,476 --> 01:10:04,931
Coming!

1202
01:10:08,316 --> 01:10:10,757
What kind of creature are you?

1203
01:10:10,758 --> 01:10:12,930
My name is Gkranion!

1204
01:10:15,569 --> 01:10:17,720
I'm in love!

1205
01:10:20,194 --> 01:10:22,589
I need to find a wormhole.

1206
01:10:29,301 --> 01:10:31,316
Einstein, the light is red.

1207
01:10:31,317 --> 01:10:33,652
I walk here.

1208
01:10:33,918 --> 01:10:35,116
Cake!

1209
01:10:40,267 --> 01:10:42,691
Here they are! Do not lose them!

1210
01:10:48,341 --> 01:10:50,102
I try to find another wormhole...

1211
01:10:50,103 --> 01:10:51,830
... But all lead back to the present.

1212
01:10:51,831 --> 01:10:53,803
Time Travel failed.

1213
01:10:53,804 --> 01:10:56,007
Journey time failed.

1214
01:11:02,146 --> 01:11:04,478
There is!
Follow them!

1215
01:11:04,479 --> 01:11:07,218
Penny, my queen,
I know you're there.

1216
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:10,428
We come Sermanous!

1217
01:11:13,846 --> 01:11:15,267
Time Travel failed.

1218
01:11:15,268 --> 01:11:16,921
Mr Peabody, attention!

1219
01:11:27,984 --> 01:11:29,492
Sermanous, hold on.

1220
01:11:29,493 --> 01:11:32,250
'll Liberate from this egg.

1221
01:11:34,739 --> 01:11:35,712
Threw this weapon,

1222
01:11:35,713 --> 01:11:37,523
And removal
this futuristic vessel.

1223
01:11:37,524 --> 01:11:40,477
I do not take orders from anyone!

1224
01:11:40,478 --> 01:11:43,662
Freedom, Equality, Fraternity!

1225
01:11:47,218 --> 01:11:49,028
Me let me, bro.

1226
01:11:50,227 --> 01:11:53,138
Get out, Peabody,
walk on air.

1227
01:11:54,536 --> 01:11:56,696
Peabody  Sir, you are under arrest...

1228
01:11:56,697 --> 01:11:59,271
... kidnapping, dangerous driving...

1229
01:11:59,272 --> 01:12:01,812
... and much more serious offenses!

1230
01:12:01,813 --> 01:12:03,177
Not understand.

1231
01:12:03,178 --> 01:12:05,355
There slot then spacetime.

1232
01:12:05,356 --> 01:12:07,880
If you arrest me, I will be unable to fix
...

1233
01:12:09,045 --> 01:12:11,179
For too long
fooling the world...

1234
01:12:11,180 --> 01:12:14,227
... with your fancy walking
and your little red bow. ..

1235
01:12:14,228 --> 01:12:15,720
... and look what happened.

1236
01:12:15,721 --> 01:12:17,125
Get out of here!

1237
01:12:17,126 --> 01:12:18,491
Wait.

1238
01:12:18,724 --> 01:12:21,390
- Mr Peabody!
- Sherman!

1239
01:12:22,825 --> 01:12:25,012
What will happen to Mr Peabody?

1240
01:12:25,013 --> 01:12:28,764
You know what
happens to dogs that bite?

1241
01:12:28,821 --> 01:12:31,533
Let me go.
Do not know what you are doing.

1242
01:12:31,534 --> 01:12:33,869
Please,
before it's too late!

1243
01:12:34,067 --> 01:12:35,336
Wait!

1244
01:12:35,371 --> 01:12:36,982
Give him another chance!

1245
01:12:36,983 --> 01:12:38,524
Runs out of opportunities.

1246
01:12:38,525 --> 01:12:40,740
Now
must pay for his mistakes.

1247
01:12:40,741 --> 01:12:43,100
But
I'm the one who did all the mistakes.

1248
01:12:43,101 --> 01:12:45,623
I'm the one who walked
the Time Machine without permission.

1249
01:12:45,624 --> 01:12:48,986
The only mistake he ever did
Mr. Peabody...

1250
01:12:49,426 --> 01:12:51,352
... was me.

1251
01:12:51,893 --> 01:12:53,422
Sherman!

1252
01:12:53,659 --> 01:12:56,491
You're absolutely right, Sherman.

1253
01:12:56,492 --> 01:13:01,331
Father could be
this dog for a boy?

1254
01:13:03,418 --> 01:13:05,160
Maybe you're right, Miss Gkranion...

1255
01:13:05,161 --> 01:13:07,448
... but have not figured
a thing.

1256
01:13:07,449 --> 01:13:08,745
What?

1257
01:13:10,070 --> 01:13:13,229
I'm also  dog!

1258
01:13:14,377 --> 01:13:17,247
If being a dog means
be like Mr. Peabody...

1259
01:13:17,248 --> 01:13:18,964
... that you do not ever turning back...

1260
01:13:18,965 --> 01:13:22,238
... and is always there to
in pick up when you fall...

1261
01:13:22,418 --> 01:13:26,460
... And loves,
many times they screw up...

1262
01:13:26,461 --> 01:13:29,345
... if it means being a dog...

1263
01:13:29,346 --> 01:13:32,461
... then yes.
I am also dog!

1264
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:36,331
I'm dog!

1265
01:13:36,332 --> 01:13:38,799
I'm dog!

1266
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:41,500
I'm dog!

1267
01:13:41,501 --> 01:13:43,248
Me too!

1268
01:13:43,482 --> 01:13:44,772
A poodle!

1269
01:13:44,807 --> 01:13:46,782
I'm also a dog.

1270
01:13:46,783 --> 01:13:48,534
Inside myself the question 'dog'.

1271
01:13:48,535 --> 01:13:51,078
- I am too.
- I.

1272
01:14:06,362 --> 01:14:08,717
I'm also a dog.

1273
01:14:15,098 --> 01:14:17,230
I am Spartacus.

1274
01:14:17,625 --> 01:14:19,718
Okay, fine.
You are all dogs.

1275
01:14:19,719 --> 01:14:21,778
But
can not change the law.

1276
01:14:21,779 --> 01:14:23,683
I know someone who can.

1277
01:14:25,581 --> 01:14:27,803
George Washington!

1278
01:14:28,714 --> 01:14:31,105
We hold these truths to be self-evident
.

1279
01:14:31,106 --> 01:14:34,698
That all men,
and some dogs...

1280
01:14:34,805 --> 01:14:38,173
... Are made to be equal.

1281
01:14:38,314 --> 01:14:42,786
I ask here by Mr. Peabody
a presidential pardon.

1282
01:14:42,787 --> 01:14:44,236
Me too.

1283
01:14:44,271 --> 01:14:46,299
I've done worse.

1284
01:15:00,244 --> 01:15:02,907
Mr Peabody, look!

1285
01:15:13,230 --> 01:15:14,564
Hand!

1286
01:15:14,599 --> 01:15:15,864
What would you do?

1287
01:15:17,399 --> 01:15:20,252
It is the largest collection of
minds, that has ever existed.

1288
01:15:20,253 --> 01:15:23,250
Definitely would think otherwise
to go back to the past.

1289
01:15:23,251 --> 01:15:25,340
I can build a flying machine.

1290
01:15:25,341 --> 01:15:27,042
And we're going too fast!

1291
01:15:27,043 --> 01:15:30,011
But remember that as
approaching the speed of light...

1292
01:15:30,012 --> 01:15:32,493
... gravity will increase too.

1293
01:15:32,494 --> 01:15:36,339
And basically, for every action,
there is an equal and opposite reaction.

1294
01:15:36,340 --> 01:15:39,917
How about throwing a punch
in this hole?

1295
01:15:48,259 --> 01:15:50,160
I have an idea.

1296
01:15:50,466 --> 01:15:53,093
Listen everyone!
I have an idea!

1297
01:15:53,094 --> 01:15:55,369
Yes it is, Sherman?

1298
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:57,724
Why not go in the future?

1299
01:15:57,725 --> 01:15:59,011
In the future?

1300
01:15:59,046 --> 01:16:01,204
I have never been there before.

1301
01:16:01,205 --> 01:16:04,046
So, probably not that bad.

1302
01:16:04,779 --> 01:16:07,762
Sherman, this is it!
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

1303
01:16:07,763 --> 01:16:08,983
Not usually.

1304
01:16:09,018 --> 01:16:11,453
It's exactly what you said you all!

1305
01:16:11,847 --> 01:16:14,531
Only is exactly the opposite!

1306
01:16:14,532 --> 01:16:16,735
If we put the Time Machine
to go in the future...

1307
01:16:16,736 --> 01:16:18,360
... and go too quickly...

1308
01:16:18,361 --> 01:16:20,503
... You create your own gravitational field
...

1309
01:16:20,504 --> 01:16:22,468
... that is equal and opposite...

1310
01:16:22,469 --> 01:16:25,856
... the slot then spacetime!

1311
01:16:27,670 --> 01:16:29,892
I did not realize...

1312
01:16:30,139 --> 01:16:33,905
'll Fly up there,
and give a punch in the hole!

1313
01:16:33,906 --> 01:16:35,485
