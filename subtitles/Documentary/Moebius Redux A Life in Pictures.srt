00:01:16,758 --> 00:01:19,636
<i>This is the end</i>

2
00:01:19,762 --> 00:01:22,724
<i>Beautiful friend</i>

3
00:01:26,061 --> 00:01:28,939
<i>This is the end</i>

4
00:01:29,064 --> 00:01:31,610
<i>My only friend</i>

5
00:01:31,735 --> 00:01:33,695
<i>The end</i>

6
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,575
<i>Of our elaborate plans</i>

7
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,619
<i>The end</i>

8
00:01:39,744 --> 00:01:43,373
<i>Of everything that stands</i>

9
00:01:43,499 --> 00:01:45,417
<i>The end</i>

10
00:01:45,542 --> 00:01:49,422
<i>No safety nor surprise</i>

11
00:01:49,547 --> 00:01:51,508
<i>The end</i>

12
00:01:51,633 --> 00:01:57,348
<i>I'll never look into your eyes</i>

13
00:01:57,473 --> 00:01:59,517
<i>Again</i>

14
00:02:03,772 --> 00:02:06,484
<i>Can you picture</i>

15
00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:08,861
<i>What will be</i>

16
00:02:08,945 --> 00:02:14,159
<i>So limitless and free</i>

17
00:02:14,284 --> 00:02:17,956
<i>Desperately in need</i>

18
00:02:18,081 --> 00:02:19,958
<i>Of some</i>

19
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:22,669
<i>Stranger's hand</i>

20
00:02:22,794 --> 00:02:24,672
<i>In a</i>

21
00:02:24,797 --> 00:02:27,216
<i>Desperate land</i>

22
00:03:14,897 --> 00:03:19,277
<i>Lost in a Roman</i>

23
00:03:19,402 --> 00:03:22,948
<i>Wilderness of pain</i>

24
00:03:26,035 --> 00:03:30,624
<i>And all the children</i>

25
00:03:30,749 --> 00:03:34,504
<i>Are insane</i>

26
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:41,720
<i>All the children</i>

27
00:03:41,845 --> 00:03:45,600
<i>Are insane</i>

28
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:53,442
<i>Waiting for the summer rain</i>

29
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:56,111
<i>Yeah</i>

30
00:04:22,184 --> 00:04:23,978
<i>Saigon. </i>

31
00:04:25,855 --> 00:04:27,899
<i>Shit. </i>

32
00:04:29,025 --> 00:04:31,903
<i>I'm still only in Saigon. </i>

33
00:04:39,454 --> 00:04:44,335
<i>Every time, I think I'm gonna
wake up back in the jungle. </i>

34
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:52,636
<i>When I was home after
my first tour, it was worse. </i>

35
00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:04,484
<i>I'd wake up,
and there'd be nothing. </i>

36
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:16,331
<i>I hardly said a word to my wife
until I said yes to a divorce. </i>

37
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:22,171
<i>When I was here,
I wanted to be there. </i>

38
00:05:22,296 --> 00:05:28,136
<i>When I was there, all I could think
of was getting back into the jungle. </i>

39
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,184
<i>I'm here a week now. </i>

40
00:05:35,937 --> 00:05:38,732
<i>Waiting for a mission... </i>

41
00:05:38,857 --> 00:05:41,276
<i>getting softer. </i>

42
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,411
<i>Every minute I stay
in this room, I get weaker. </i>

43
00:05:49,537 --> 00:05:54,459
<i>And every minute Charlie squats
in the bush, he gets stronger. </i>

44
00:05:58,338 --> 00:06:02,969
<i>Each time I looked around,
the walls moved in a little tighter. </i>

45
00:06:14,315 --> 00:06:17,987
<i>Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck
Yeah</i>

46
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:23,952
<i>Come on, babe, come on now
Livin' life, yeah</i>

47
00:06:24,077 --> 00:06:27,873
<i>Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck
Yeah</i>

48
00:06:27,998 --> 00:06:31,377
<i>Fuck, yeah, come on, baby</i>

49
00:06:31,502 --> 00:06:33,880
<i>Fuck, baby, fuck, fuck</i>

50
00:06:34,005 --> 00:06:36,258
<i>Oh, yeah, oh, fuck</i>

51
00:06:36,383 --> 00:06:38,385
<i>Yeah, do it, yeah, come on</i>

52
00:06:40,513 --> 00:06:43,766
<i>Yeah, all right</i>

53
00:07:01,746 --> 00:07:03,582
<i>Yeah</i>

54
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:08,504
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

55
00:07:08,504 --> 00:07:10,882
<i>Yeah</i>

56
00:07:11,007 --> 00:07:14,677
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

57
00:07:14,802 --> 00:07:16,889
<i>Yeah</i>

58
00:07:42,043 --> 00:07:45,506
<i>Everyone gets everything he wants. </i>

59
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,342
<i>I wanted a mission... </i>

60
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:52,264
<i>and for my sins,
they gave me one. </i>

61
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,766
<i>Brought it up to me
like room service. </i>

62
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:58,563
Captain Willard?
Are you in there?

63
00:07:58,688 --> 00:08:00,731
Yeah, I'm comin'.

64
00:08:00,857 --> 00:08:03,652
<i>It was a real choice mission. </i>

65
00:08:03,777 --> 00:08:08,116
<i>And when it was over,
I'd never want another. </i>

66
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,919
- What do you want?
- Are you all right, Captain?

67
00:08:19,044 --> 00:08:21,923
What does it look like?

68
00:08:30,141 --> 00:08:32,936
- Are you Willard, 505th Battalion?
- Affirmative.

69
00:08:33,061 --> 00:08:34,938
- 173rd Airborne?
- Yeah.

70
00:08:35,063 --> 00:08:39,569
- Assigned to SOG?
- Hey, buddy, gonna shut the door?

71
00:08:39,694 --> 00:08:44,283
We have orders to escort you
to the airfield.

72
00:08:45,409 --> 00:08:47,786
- What are the charges?
- Sir?

73
00:08:47,912 --> 00:08:51,208
- What'd I do?
- There's no charges, Captain.

74
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:55,129
You have orders to report to
Com-Sec Intelligence at Nha Trang.

75
00:08:55,254 --> 00:08:58,132
- I see.
- All right?

76
00:08:58,257 --> 00:09:01,220
- Nha Trang, for me?
- That's right.

77
00:09:01,345 --> 00:09:04,723
Come on, Captain. You still have
a few hours to get cleaned up.

78
00:09:04,848 --> 00:09:08,853
- I'm not feeling too good.
- Captain?

79
00:09:08,978 --> 00:09:12,191
Dave, come here and give me a hand.
We got a dead one.

80
00:09:12,316 --> 00:09:15,319
Come on, Captain.
Let's take a shower.

81
00:09:15,444 --> 00:09:17,531
- Don't be an ass.
- Get a hold of him good.

82
00:09:17,656 --> 00:09:19,866
We're gonna take a shower, Captain.
In we go.

83
00:09:19,991 --> 00:09:23,496
Stand underneath this, Captain.

84
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:36,010
<i>I was going to the worst place
in the world... </i>

85
00:09:36,135 --> 00:09:38,888
<i>and I didn't even know it yet. </i>

86
00:09:39,013 --> 00:09:41,976
<i>Weeks away and hundreds
of miles up a river... </i>

87
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:45,229
<i>that snaked through the war
like a main circuit cable... </i>

88
00:09:45,354 --> 00:09:48,024
<i>plugged straight into Kurtz. </i>

89
00:09:50,193 --> 00:09:52,989
<i>It was no accident that
I got to be the caretaker... </i>

90
00:09:53,072 --> 00:09:55,783
<i>of Colonel
Walter E. Kurtz's memory... </i>

91
00:09:55,908 --> 00:10:00,664
<i>any more than being back
in Saigon was an accident. </i>

92
00:10:00,789 --> 00:10:04,627
<i>There is no way to tell his story
without telling my own. </i>

93
00:10:04,752 --> 00:10:07,338
<i>If his story
is really a confession... </i>

94
00:10:07,463 --> 00:10:10,009
<i>- Captain Willard reporting, sir.
- Then so is mine. </i>

95
00:10:10,092 --> 00:10:13,262
- Captain. Good. Come on in.
- Thank you, sir.

96
00:10:13,387 --> 00:10:17,350
- Stand at ease.
- General.

97
00:10:18,435 --> 00:10:21,021
You want a cigarette?

98
00:10:21,146 --> 00:10:23,649
No, thank you, sir.

99
00:10:23,774 --> 00:10:28,197
- Have you ever seen this man before?
- No, sir.

100
00:10:28,322 --> 00:10:31,033
- Met the general or myself?
- No, sir.

101
00:10:31,158 --> 00:10:33,620
Not personally.

102
00:10:33,745 --> 00:10:37,457
- You've worked a lot on your own?
- Yes, sir, I have.

103
00:10:37,582 --> 00:10:39,043
Your report
specifies intelligence...

104
00:10:39,168 --> 00:10:40,544
counterintelligence
with Com-Sec, "l" Corps.

105
00:10:40,669 --> 00:10:44,758
I'm not presently disposed to
discuss those operations, sir.

106
00:10:52,934 --> 00:10:55,436
Did you not work for
the CIA in "l" Corps?

107
00:10:57,147 --> 00:10:59,066
No, sir.

108
00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:01,860
Did you not assassinate
a government tax collector...

109
00:11:01,985 --> 00:11:04,739
Quang Tri Province,
June 18, 1968?

110
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:08,744
Captain?

111
00:11:10,329 --> 00:11:15,627
Sir, I am unaware of any
such activity or operation...

112
00:11:15,752 --> 00:11:20,883
nor would I be disposed to
discuss such an operation...

113
00:11:21,008 --> 00:11:24,679
if it did,
in fact, exist, sir.

114
00:11:35,692 --> 00:11:37,945
I thought we'd have
a bite of lunch while we talk.

115
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:41,865
I hope you brought
a good appetite, Captain.

116
00:11:41,991 --> 00:11:46,872
I notice that you have
a bad hand there. You wounded?

117
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:49,333
I had a little fishing accident
on R and R, sir.

118
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:53,045
- Fishing on R and R?
- Yes, sir.

119
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,549
But you're feeling fit?
You're ready for duty?

120
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:58,093
Yes, General.
Very much so, sir.

121
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:03,766
Well, let's see what we have here,
roast beef, and usually it's not bad.

122
00:12:05,184 --> 00:12:08,272
Try some, Jerry,
and pass it around.

123
00:12:08,397 --> 00:12:12,444
To save a little time,
we might pass both ways.

124
00:12:12,569 --> 00:12:17,824
Captain, I don't know how
you feel about this shrimp...

125
00:12:17,949 --> 00:12:19,827
but if you'll eat it...

126
00:12:19,952 --> 00:12:24,583
you'll never have to prove
your courage in any other way.

127
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:28,587
I swear, why don't I
just take a piece here?

128
00:12:28,712 --> 00:12:33,009
Captain, you've heard of
Colonel Walter E. Kurtz?

129
00:12:33,134 --> 00:12:37,223
Yes, sir,
I've heard the name.

130
00:12:37,348 --> 00:12:41,185
Oh, Jesus! Operations officer,
Fifth Special Forces.

131
00:12:41,311 --> 00:12:44,856
Luke, would you play that tape
for the captain, please?

132
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:47,485
- Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.
- Listen to this carefully, Captain.

133
00:12:49,904 --> 00:12:52,950
<i>October 9, 0430 hours,
sector Peter, Victor, King. </i>

134
00:12:53,075 --> 00:12:56,245
These were monitored
out of Cambodia.

135
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:59,082
This has been verified
as Col. Kurtz's voice.

136
00:12:59,207 --> 00:13:03,294
<i>I watched a snail... </i>

137
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:07,758

00:13:09,885 --> 00:13:12,305
<i>That's my dream. </i>

00:13:13,431 --> 00:13:16,561
<i>That's my nightmare. </i>

<i>Crawling, slithering... </i>

141
00:13:20,982 --> 00:13:24,152

<i>We must incinerate them. </i>

<i>Cow after cow. </i>

<i>Village after village.

<i>And they call me an assassin. </i>

152
00:14:01,154 --> 00:14:06,619
<i>What do you call it when
the assassins accuse the assassin? </i>

153
00:14:06,744 --> 00:14:11,583
<i>They lie. They lie,
and we have to be merciful... </i>

154
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,919
<i>for those who lie. </i>

155
00:14:14,044 --> 00:14:16,839
<i>Those nabobs. </i>

156
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,092
<i>I hate them. </i>

157
00:14:22,012 --> 00:14:24,598
<i>I do hate them. </i>

158
00:14:29,228 --> 00:14:32,358
Walt Kurtz was one of
the most outstanding officers...

159
00:14:32,483 --> 00:14:34,568
this country's ever produced.

160
00:14:34,693 --> 00:14:38,782
He was brilliant.
He was outstanding in every way.

161
00:14:38,907 --> 00:14:44,580
And he was a good man, too,
a humanitarian man.

162
00:14:44,705 --> 00:14:47,708
A man of wit and humour.

163
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:51,797
He joined the Special Forces.

164
00:14:51,922 --> 00:14:55,635
And after that his...

165
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,846
ideas, methods...

166
00:15:00,682 --> 00:15:02,643
became...

167
00:15:04,895 --> 00:15:07,023
unsound.

168
00:15:11,653 --> 00:15:13,531
Unsound.

169
00:15:18,829 --> 00:15:21,373
Now he's crossed
into Cambodia with this...

170
00:15:21,498 --> 00:15:24,752
Montagnard army of his
that worship...

171
00:15:24,877 --> 00:15:27,547
the man like a god...

172
00:15:27,672 --> 00:15:32,553
and follow every order,
however ridiculous.

173
00:15:32,678 --> 00:15:36,808
Well, I have some other
shocking news to tell you.

174
00:15:36,933 --> 00:15:42,481
Col. Kurtz was about
to be arrested for murder.

175
00:15:42,607 --> 00:15:46,485
I don't follow, sir.
Murdered who?

176
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:50,616
Kurtz had ordered the execution of
some Vietnamese intelligence agents...

177
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:54,662
men he believed
were double agents.

178
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:59,960
So he took matters
into his own hands.

179
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:02,671
Well, you see, Willard...

180
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:08,428
in this war, things
get confused out there.

181
00:16:08,553 --> 00:16:12,350
Power, ideals,
the old morality...

182
00:16:12,475 --> 00:16:15,311
and practical
military necessity.

183
00:16:17,314 --> 00:16:20,817
But out there
with these natives...

184
00:16:20,943 --> 00:16:25,615
it must be a temptation to...

185
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,117
be God.

186
00:16:30,454 --> 00:16:34,709
Because there's a conflict
in every human heart...

187
00:16:34,834 --> 00:16:38,421
between the rational
and the irrational...

188
00:16:38,546 --> 00:16:41,842
between good and evil...

189
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:44,929
and good does not
always triumph.

190
00:16:47,015 --> 00:16:49,935
Sometimes...

191
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,230
the dark side...

192
00:16:52,355 --> 00:16:57,151
overcomes what Lincoln called
the better angels of our nature.

193
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:01,073
Every man has got
a breaking point.

194
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:04,327
You and I have them.

195
00:17:05,453 --> 00:17:08,331
Walt Kurtz has reached his.

196
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,129
And very obviously,
he has gone insane.

197
00:17:25,435 --> 00:17:29,273
Yes, sir. Very much so, sir.
Obviously insane.

198
00:17:33,903 --> 00:17:37,365
Your mission is to proceed up the
Nung River in a navy patrol boat...

199
00:17:39,493 --> 00:17:42,455
pick up Col. Kurtz's path
at Nu Mung Ba...

200
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,751
follow it, learn what
you can along the way.

201
00:17:45,876 --> 00:17:49,171
When you find the colonel,
infiltrate his team by...

202
00:17:49,296 --> 00:17:54,177
whatever means available and
terminate the colonel's command.

203
00:18:00,392 --> 00:18:03,146
Terminate the colonel?

204
00:18:03,271 --> 00:18:08,361
He's out there operating
without any decent restraint...

205
00:18:08,486 --> 00:18:12,490
totally beyond the pale
of any acceptable...

206
00:18:12,615 --> 00:18:14,576
human conduct...

207
00:18:14,701 --> 00:18:18,872
and he is still on the field,
commanding troops.

208
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:22,460
Terminate with
extreme prejudice.

209
00:18:23,711 --> 00:18:26,340
You understand, Captain,
that this mission...

210
00:18:26,465 --> 00:18:31,012
does not exist
nor will it ever exist.

211
00:19:26,452 --> 00:19:30,206
<i>How many people
had I already killed? </i>

212
00:19:30,332 --> 00:19:34,085
<i>There were those six
that I knew about for sure... </i>

213
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:38,633
<i>close enough to blow
their last breath in my face. </i>

214
00:19:39,717 --> 00:19:43,430
<i>But this time
it was an American... </i>

215
00:19:43,555 --> 00:19:45,557
<i>and an officer. </i>

216
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:59,199
<i>That wasn't supposed to make
any difference to me... </i>

217
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:01,368
<i>but it did. </i>

218
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:06,540
<i>Shit. Charging a man
with murder in this place... </i>

219
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:12,214
<i>was like handing out
speeding tickets at the Indy 500.</i>

220
00:20:12,339 --> 00:20:16,719
<i>I took the mission.
What the hell else was I gonna do? </i>

221
00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:22,309
<i>But I really didn't know
what I'd do when I found him. </i>

222
00:20:29,109 --> 00:20:32,320
- Did you check the tank?
- Yeah.

223
00:20:34,615 --> 00:20:38,536
<i>I was being ferried down
the coast in a navy PBR... </i>

224
00:20:38,661 --> 00:20:42,666
<i>a type of plastic patrol boat...
a pretty common sight on the rivers. </i>

225
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:45,670
<i>They said it was a good way to
pick up information and move... </i>

226
00:20:45,795 --> 00:20:50,008
<i>without drawing a lot
of attention, and that was okay. </i>

227
00:20:50,133 --> 00:20:53,095
<i>I needed the air and the time. </i>

228
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,514
<i>Only problem was
I wouldn't be alone. </i>

229
00:20:55,639 --> 00:20:57,726
Mornin', Captain.

230
00:20:59,936 --> 00:21:03,107
<i>The crew were
mostly just kids... </i>

231
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:07,111
<i>rock and rollers with
one foot in their graves. </i>

232
00:21:07,236 --> 00:21:10,824
- How old are you?
- Seventeen.

233
00:21:10,949 --> 00:21:14,370
<i>The machinist... the one they
called Chef... was from New Orleans. </i>

234
00:21:14,495 --> 00:21:17,373
<i>He was wrapped too tight
for Vietnam. </i>

235
00:21:17,498 --> 00:21:20,210
<i>Probably wrapped too tight
for New Orleans. </i>

236
00:21:20,336 --> 00:21:22,254
<i>Lance, on the forward fifties... </i>

237
00:21:22,379 --> 00:21:25,132
<i>was a famous surfer
from the beaches south of L.A. </i>

238
00:21:25,215 --> 00:21:29,054
<i>To look at him, you wouldn't believe
he'd ever fired a weapon in his life. </i>

239
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:35,144
<i>Clean... Mr. Clean... was
from some South Bronx shit-hole... </i>

240
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,397
<i>and I think the light
and the space of Vietnam... </i>

241
00:21:37,522 --> 00:21:41,109
<i>really put the zap on his head. </i>

242
00:21:42,527 --> 00:21:45,156
<i>Then there was Phillips,
the chief. </i>

243
00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:49,161
<i>It might have been my mission, but
it sure as shit was the chief’s boat. </i>

244
00:21:49,286 --> 00:21:51,205
There's about two points
where we can draw enough water...

245
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:53,707
to get into the Nung River.

246
00:21:53,832 --> 00:21:57,962
They're both hot.
Belong to Charlie.

247
00:21:58,088 --> 00:22:00,465
Don't worry about it.

248
00:22:00,591 --> 00:22:03,678
Don't smoke.

249
00:22:03,803 --> 00:22:06,932
You know, I've pulled
a few special ops in here.

250
00:22:07,057 --> 00:22:09,643
About six months ago...

251
00:22:09,768 --> 00:22:14,065
I took a man who was going up
past the bridge at Do Lung.

252
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:16,859
He was regular army too.

253
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:22,324
Heard he shot himself
in the head.

254
00:22:30,251 --> 00:22:34,130
<i>At first I thought
they handed me the wrong dossier. </i>

255
00:22:34,255 --> 00:22:36,800
<i>I couldn't believe
they wanted this man dead. </i>

256
00:22:38,427 --> 00:22:41,305
<i>Third-generation West Point,
top of his class. </i>

257
00:22:41,431 --> 00:22:45,643
<i>Korea, Airborne,
about a thousand decorations. </i>

258
00:22:45,768 --> 00:22:47,771
<i>Et cetera, et cetera. </i>

259
00:22:50,357 --> 00:22:55,280
<i>I'd heard his voice on the tape,
and it really put the hook in me... </i>

260
00:22:55,405 --> 00:22:59,994
<i>but I couldn't connect up
that voice with this man. </i>

261
00:23:06,126 --> 00:23:09,963
<i>Like they said,
he had an impressive career. </i>

262
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:14,969
<i>Maybe too impressive.
I mean, perfect. </i>

263
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:19,308
<i>He was being groomed for one of
the top slots in the corporation... </i>

264
00:23:19,433 --> 00:23:22,729
<i>general, chief of staff,
anything. </i>

265
00:23:24,439 --> 00:23:28,444
<i>In 1964, he returned from a tour
with Advisory Command in Vietnam... </i>

266
00:23:28,569 --> 00:23:30,905
<i>and things started to slip. </i>

267
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:33,115
<i>His report to
the Joint Chiefs of Staff... </i>

268
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,661
<i>and Lyndon Johnson was restricted. </i>

269
00:23:37,371 --> 00:23:41,125
<i>Seems they didn't dig
what he had to tell them. </i>

270
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:44,170
<i>During the next few months, he
made three requests for transfer... </i>

271
00:23:44,295 --> 00:23:49,343
<i>to Airborne training, Fort Benning,
Georgia, and was finally accepted. </i>

272
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,474
<i>Airborne? </i>

273
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:59,105
<i>He was 38 years old. </i>

274
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:02,483
<i>Why the fuck would he do that? </i>

275
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:09,075
<i>1966, joins Special Forces... </i>

276
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,160
<i>returns to Vietnam. </i>

277
00:24:11,452 --> 00:24:13,454
Hey, what's that?

278
00:24:13,579 --> 00:24:16,083
- Arc light.
- What's up?

279
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:18,752
- B-52 strike.
- Yeah?

280
00:24:18,877 --> 00:24:20,755
- What's that?
- Arc light.

281
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,800
I hate that. Every time I hear that,
something terrible happens.

282
00:24:23,925 --> 00:24:25,802
Charlie don't never
see 'em or hear 'em, man.

283
00:24:25,927 --> 00:24:27,179
There they are.

284
00:24:27,263 --> 00:24:29,557
Concussion will suck the air
out of your damn lungs.

285
00:24:29,682 --> 00:24:31,684
Something terrible
is gonna happen.

286
00:24:31,809 --> 00:24:35,439
Smoke! Secondary burning.

287
00:24:35,564 --> 00:24:38,067
Hueys over there. Lots of Hueys.

288
00:24:38,192 --> 00:24:41,070
Let's have a look, Chief.

289
00:24:41,195 --> 00:24:44,783
<i>It was the Air-Cav.
First of the Ninth... </i>

290
00:24:44,908 --> 00:24:45,701
That's them.

291
00:24:45,826 --> 00:24:48,704
<i>our escorts to the mouth
of the Nung River. </i>

292
00:24:48,829 --> 00:24:52,667
<i>But they were supposed to be waiting
for us another 30 kilometres ahead. </i>

293
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:57,965
<i>Well, Air Mobile.
Those boys just couldn't stay put. </i>

294
00:25:09,645 --> 00:25:12,607
Hey, kid, come on.
Get down. Come on.

295
00:25:23,661 --> 00:25:26,540
<i>First of the Ninth was
an old cavalry division... </i>

296
00:25:26,665 --> 00:25:28,542
<i>that had cashed in its horses
for choppers... </i>

297
00:25:28,667 --> 00:25:32,547
<i>and gone tear-assing around
'Nam looking for the shit. </i>

298
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:37,220
<i>They'd given Charlie
a few surprises in their time here. </i>

299
00:25:37,345 --> 00:25:42,184
<i>What they were mopping up now hadn't
even happened yet an hour ago. </i>

300
00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:44,561
Just keeping running by.
We're for television.

301
00:25:44,687 --> 00:25:46,980
Don't look at the camera.
Just keep... Go on. Keep going.

302
00:25:47,106 --> 00:25:48,983
This is for television.
Don't look at the camera.

303
00:25:49,109 --> 00:25:52,362
Just go by like you're fighting,
like you're fighting.

304
00:25:52,487 --> 00:25:56,033
Don't look at the camera.
It's for television. Just go through.

305
00:25:56,158 --> 00:25:58,119
Just go by. Keep on going.

306
00:25:58,244 --> 00:26:00,372
Keep going. Don't look at the camera.
Go on. Keep going.

307
00:26:00,497 --> 00:26:02,332
All right, come on. Go.

308
00:26:07,422 --> 00:26:09,382
Right here. Yes.
Over here. Over here.

309
00:26:23,357 --> 00:26:25,735
Where can I find the CO?

310
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:30,032
That's the colonel comin' down!

311
00:26:38,291 --> 00:26:40,961
The CO's on that chopper.

312
00:27:03,236 --> 00:27:06,741
Lieutenant, bomb that tree line
back about 100 yards!

313
00:27:06,866 --> 00:27:09,995
- Give me some room to breathe!
- Yes, sir!

314
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:15,960
Body cards!

315
00:27:16,086 --> 00:27:18,129
- Sir?
- Bring my body cards!

316
00:27:18,254 --> 00:27:20,131
Yes, sir!

317
00:27:22,718 --> 00:27:25,971
I'm the Fourth Tank commander.
I got five tanks broken down.

318
00:27:26,097 --> 00:27:29,226
We're all right with the tanks.
It's all right, Captain.

319
00:27:29,351 --> 00:27:30,602
Captain Willard!

320
00:27:30,727 --> 00:27:34,107
I carry priority papers from
Com-Sec Intelligence, II Corps.

321
00:27:34,232 --> 00:27:36,150
I understand Nha Trang
has briefed you...

322
00:27:36,275 --> 00:27:38,152
on the requirements of my mission.

323
00:27:38,277 --> 00:27:40,823
What mission?
I haven't heard from Nha Trang.

324
00:27:40,948 --> 00:27:43,867
Sir, your unit is supposed
to escort us into the Nung!

325
00:27:43,992 --> 00:27:46,162
- We'll see what we can do.
- Colonel!

326
00:27:46,287 --> 00:27:51,043
But just stay out of my way
until this is done, Captain.

327
00:27:53,462 --> 00:27:56,299
All right, let's see what we have.
Let's see what we have.

328
00:27:56,425 --> 00:28:01,471
A two of spades, three of spades,
four of diamonds...

329
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:04,183
six of clubs, eight of spades.

330
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:07,353
There isn't one worth a jack
in the whole bunch.

331
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:10,357
Four of diamonds.

332
00:28:10,482 --> 00:28:14,195
- Hey, Captain, what's that?
- Death cards!

333
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,615
- What?
- Death cards!

334
00:28:17,741 --> 00:28:20,077
- Death?
- Lets Charlie know who did this.

335
00:28:23,664 --> 00:28:26,460
<i>- Cheer up, son.
- We will not hurt or harm you. </i>

336
00:28:26,585 --> 00:28:30,297
- Fire in the hole!
- Fire in the hole!

337
00:28:30,589 --> 00:28:34,052
<i>This is an area
that is controlled... </i>

338
00:28:34,177 --> 00:28:36,554
<i>by the Vietcong
and North Vietnamese. </i>

339
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,599
Jim.

340
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:45,899
<i>We are here to help you. </i>

341
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:50,988
<i>- We extend a welcome hand...
- Come on.</i>

342
00:28:51,113 --> 00:28:53,157
<i>-to those who would like to return...
- Everybody in?</i>

343
00:28:53,282 --> 00:28:57,579
<i>to the arms of
the South Vietnamese government. </i>

344
00:28:57,704 --> 00:29:01,125
Get in. Hurry up.

345
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:03,920
Move it out.

346
00:29:04,045 --> 00:29:06,548
<i>This is an area
that is controlled... </i>

347
00:29:06,673 --> 00:29:09,259
<i>by the Vietcong
and North Vietnamese. </i>

348
00:29:09,385 --> 00:29:14,516
Hey! What's this?
What is this?

349
00:29:14,641 --> 00:29:17,310
This man's hurt
pretty bad, sir.

350
00:29:17,435 --> 00:29:20,856
About the only thing that's holding
his guts in, sir, is that pot lid.

351
00:29:20,981 --> 00:29:23,360
Yeah? What do you have to say?

352
00:29:23,485 --> 00:29:29,283
This soldier is dirty VC. He wants
water. He can drink paddy water.

353
00:29:29,409 --> 00:29:32,787
Get outta here!
Give me that canteen.

354
00:29:32,912 --> 00:29:36,041
- He's VC!
- Any man that's brave enough to...

355
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:38,752
Get outta here!
I'll kick your fuckin' ass!

356
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:40,964
He killed a lot of our people!

357
00:29:41,089 --> 00:29:43,216
Any man brave enough
to fight with his guts...

358
00:29:43,299 --> 00:29:45,301
strapped on him
can drink from my canteen.

359
00:29:45,427 --> 00:29:49,473
Hey, Colonel, I think one of those
sailors is Lance Johnson, the surfer.

360
00:29:49,598 --> 00:29:53,395
- Where? Here? You sure?
- Down there.

361
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,480
Yeah? Here.

362
00:29:55,605 --> 00:29:58,526
Repeat. We have a body count.
We have...

363
00:30:01,195 --> 00:30:03,239
What's your name, sailor?

364
00:30:03,364 --> 00:30:06,201
- Gunner's Mate Third Class Johnson.
- Gunner's Mate Third Class...

365
00:30:06,285 --> 00:30:10,373
- Lance Johnson, the surfer?
- Yes, sir.

366
00:30:10,498 --> 00:30:14,627
It's an honour to meet you. I've
admired your nose riding for years.

367
00:30:14,753 --> 00:30:17,590
I like your cutback too. I think
you have the best cutback there is.

368
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:20,342
- Thank you, sir.
- You can cut out the "sir" crap.

369
00:30:20,468 --> 00:30:22,471
I'm Bill Kilgore.
I'm a goofy foot.

370
00:30:22,596 --> 00:30:24,473
- This guy with ya?
- Yeah.

371
00:30:24,598 --> 00:30:26,391
I want you to meet some guys.

372
00:30:26,516 --> 00:30:28,394
- This is Mike from San Diego.
- Far out.

373
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:31,355
- Johnny from Malibu. Solid surfers.
- John, hi. Far out.

374
00:30:31,481 --> 00:30:33,609
None of us are anywhere
near your class though.

375
00:30:33,734 --> 00:30:35,152
No way.

376
00:30:35,277 --> 00:30:39,157
We do a lot of surfing around here.
I like to finish operations early.

377
00:30:39,282 --> 00:30:41,618
Fly down to Vung Tau
for the evening glass.

378
00:30:41,743 --> 00:30:44,162
Been riding since you got here?

379
00:30:44,287 --> 00:30:46,874
No way. I haven't surfed
since I been here.

380
00:30:46,999 --> 00:30:49,376
Through Christ, our Lord...

381
00:30:49,502 --> 00:30:51,546
from Whom
all good things come...

382
00:30:51,671 --> 00:30:54,257
through Him in the unity
of the Holy Spirit.

383
00:30:54,341 --> 00:30:57,220
All glory and honour
is Yours, Almighty Father.

384
00:30:57,345 --> 00:30:59,764
Let us bring
our iniquities to the Father...

385
00:30:59,889 --> 00:31:01,808
in the words our Saviour gave us.

386
00:31:01,933 --> 00:31:06,855
Our Father, Who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

387
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:11,611
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.

388
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:14,532
Give us this day
our daily bread...

389
00:31:14,657 --> 00:31:16,534
and forgive us our trespasses...

390
00:31:16,659 --> 00:31:18,744
<i>as we forgive those
who trespass against us. </i>

391
00:31:18,869 --> 00:31:22,499
<i>Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil. </i>

392
00:31:31,552 --> 00:31:35,305
<i>Kilgore had had a pretty
good day for himself. </i>

393
00:31:35,431 --> 00:31:37,559
<i>They choppered in
the T-bones and the beer... </i>

394
00:31:37,684 --> 00:31:40,937
<i>and turned the LZ
into a beach party. </i>

395
00:31:41,062 --> 00:31:44,024
<i>The more they tried
to make it just like home... </i>

396
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:46,777
<i>the more they made
everybody miss it. </i>

397
00:31:46,902 --> 00:31:50,073
Make my meat rare...
rare but not cold.

398
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,292
<i>Well, he wasn't
a bad officer, I guess. </i>

399
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:02,921
<i>He loved his boys,
and you felt safe with him. </i>

400
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:06,300
<i>He was one of those guys that
had that weird light around him. </i>

401
00:32:06,426 --> 00:32:10,221
<i>You just knew he wasn't gonna
get so much as a scratch here. </i>

402
00:32:10,305 --> 00:32:14,185
What happened to your mission?
Nha Trang forget all about you?

403
00:32:22,235 --> 00:32:25,281
Airborne.

404
00:32:25,406 --> 00:32:28,868
Sir, two places we can
get into the river.

405
00:32:28,993 --> 00:32:31,997
- Yeah.
- Here and here.

406
00:32:32,122 --> 00:32:36,961
It's a pretty wide delta, but these
are the only two spots I'm sure of.

407
00:32:37,087 --> 00:32:40,090
That village you're pointing at
is kind of hairy.

408
00:32:40,215 --> 00:32:42,510
- What do you mean "hairy," sir?
- It's hairy.

409
00:32:42,635 --> 00:32:44,512
Got some pretty heavy ordnance.

410
00:32:44,637 --> 00:32:47,014
I lost a few recon ships
in there now and again.

411
00:32:47,139 --> 00:32:50,352
What's the name of
that goddam village? Vin Drin...

412
00:32:50,477 --> 00:32:52,813
- Dop.
- Dop or Lop?

413
00:32:52,938 --> 00:32:56,526
Damn gook names
all sound the same.

414
00:32:56,651 --> 00:32:59,655
Mike, you know anything about
this point at Vin Drin Dop?

415
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,657
That's a fantastic peak.

416
00:33:01,782 --> 00:33:04,201
- Peak?
- About six foot.

417
00:33:04,326 --> 00:33:07,997
It's an outstanding peak. It's got
both the long right and left slide...

418
00:33:08,123 --> 00:33:10,291
with a bowl section
that's unbelievable.

419
00:33:10,417 --> 00:33:12,795
It's just tube city.

420
00:33:15,589 --> 00:33:18,051
Why didn't you tell me
that before? A good peak.

421
00:33:18,176 --> 00:33:20,846
There aren't any good peaks
in this whole shitty country.

422
00:33:20,971 --> 00:33:22,849
It's all goddam beach break.

423
00:33:22,974 --> 00:33:25,893
It's really hairy in there.
That's where we lost McDonald.

424
00:33:26,018 --> 00:33:30,232
They shot the hell out of us there.
That's Charlie's point.

425
00:33:30,357 --> 00:33:32,734
Sir, we can go in there
tomorrow at dawn.

426
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,904
There's always a good
offshore breeze in the morning.

427
00:33:35,029 --> 00:33:36,906
We may not be able
to get the boat in.

428
00:33:37,031 --> 00:33:41,036
The draught at the mouth of
that river may be too shallow.

429
00:33:41,162 --> 00:33:44,081
We'll pick your boat up and put it
down like a baby where you want it.

430
00:33:44,206 --> 00:33:46,710
This is the First of the Ninth,
Air-Cav, son.

431
00:33:46,835 --> 00:33:51,131
Air mobile! I can take that point
and hold it as long as I like.

432
00:33:51,257 --> 00:33:54,302
You can get anyplace up that river
that suits you, young Captain.

433
00:33:54,385 --> 00:33:56,804
Hell, a six-foot peak.

434
00:33:58,056 --> 00:33:59,933
Take a gunship
back to the division.

435
00:34:00,058 --> 00:34:02,102
Lance, go with Mike and let him
pick out a board for you.

436
00:34:02,227 --> 00:34:04,397
Bring me my Yater Spoon,
the eight-six.

437
00:34:04,522 --> 00:34:06,399
- I don't know, sir...
- What is it, soldier?

438
00:34:06,524 --> 00:34:09,570
It's hairy in there.
It's Charlie's point.

439
00:34:09,695 --> 00:34:11,781
Charlie don't surf!

440
00:34:34,933 --> 00:34:38,896
Hey, Jesus, Clean, you ain't
gonna believe this. Look.

441
00:34:40,022 --> 00:34:42,900
Hey, man!
They're pickin' up the boat!

442
00:34:46,113 --> 00:34:50,034
- How are you feeling, Jimmy?
- Like a mean motherfucker, sir!

443
00:34:51,661 --> 00:34:53,621
All right, son, let 'er rip.

444
00:34:53,746 --> 00:34:56,500
Let's go!

445
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:22,726
I never have got used to a light
board. I can't get used to one.

446
00:36:22,851 --> 00:36:25,729
- I'm used to a heavy board.
- I know, it's a real drag.

447
00:36:25,854 --> 00:36:28,440
- You prefer a heavy or light board?
- Heavier.

448
00:36:28,566 --> 00:36:30,443
- Really?
- Yeah!

449
00:36:30,568 --> 00:36:33,238
I thought all the young guys
like lighter boards.

450
00:36:33,363 --> 00:36:36,450
<i>- You can't ride the nose on those.
- Big Duke Six. </i>

451
00:36:36,575 --> 00:36:38,202
This is Eagle Thrust Seven.
We've got it spotted.

452
00:36:38,327 --> 00:36:39,870
<i>Duke Six to Eagle Thrust. </i>

453
00:36:39,995 --> 00:36:43,416
Put on heading two-seven-zero.
Assume attack formation.

454
00:36:43,542 --> 00:36:45,877
<i>That's a roger, Big Duke.
We're going in. </i>

455
00:36:46,002 --> 00:36:50,049
Hey, Lance, we'll come in
low out of the rising sun.

456
00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:52,636
About a mile out,
we'll put on the music.

457
00:36:52,761 --> 00:36:55,097
- Music?
- Yeah, I use Wagner.

458
00:36:55,222 --> 00:36:59,310
Scares the hell out of the slopes.
My boys love it.

459
00:36:59,435 --> 00:37:01,771
Hey, they're gonna play music!

460
00:37:08,279 --> 00:37:11,992
How come all you guys
sit on your helmet?

461
00:37:12,117 --> 00:37:15,413
So we don't get
our balls blown off.

462
00:37:25,466 --> 00:37:29,846
Big Duke Six to Eagle Thrust.
Put on psy war op.

463
00:37:29,971 --> 00:37:34,643
Make it loud. This is a Romeo
Foxtrot. Shall we dance?

464
00:37:39,441 --> 00:37:42,152
Yes, sir!

465
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:03,317
- Come on!
- All right. Fire.

466
00:40:12,745 --> 00:40:15,833
<i>We got a couple...
at that tree line. </i>

467
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:18,877
<i>We're taking fire from the holes. </i>

468
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:22,298
Run, Charlie!

469
00:40:24,634 --> 00:40:28,556
<i>This should make
everything burn. </i>

470
00:40:38,358 --> 00:40:41,571
<i>We got a couple
of people ahead here. </i>

471
00:40:41,696 --> 00:40:45,075
<i>-What's going down here?
-We got an automatic! Shoot to kill! </i>

472
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,745
<i>-Shoot to kill in the open!
-I spotted a large weapon down below. </i>

473
00:40:48,871 --> 00:40:51,249
We're gonna go down
and check it out.

474
00:40:51,374 --> 00:40:53,710
<i>All right, this is Foxtrot.
We're pullin' in. </i>

475
00:41:03,388 --> 00:41:05,182
What a shot.

476
00:41:05,307 --> 00:41:08,101
Outstanding, Red Team. Outstanding.
Get you a case of beer for that.

477
00:41:29,919 --> 00:41:32,464
<i>Six-four-one-zero,
we're over the village right now. </i>

478
00:41:32,589 --> 00:41:35,425
I see a vehicle in the courtyard.
I'm gonna check it out.

479
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:37,845
Well done, Hawks.

480
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:40,598
Want some twenty-Mike-Mike-Vulcan
along those tree lines.

481
00:41:40,723 --> 00:41:42,642
Ripple the shit out of 'em.

482
00:41:42,767 --> 00:41:45,354
Got a vehicle on the bridge,
50 caliber on board.

483
00:41:45,437 --> 00:41:48,565
He's moving across
to resupply the weapon.

484
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:51,903
<i>Big Duke Six, clear the area.
I'm coming down myself. </i>

485
00:41:52,028 --> 00:41:53,821
Don't these people ever give up?

486
00:41:56,617 --> 00:41:59,662
Nice shot, Bill.

487
00:41:59,787 --> 00:42:03,416
- Shit!
- All right, all right!

488
00:42:03,542 --> 00:42:07,964
- It's just a flare!
- It's a flare! Gotta get outta here!

489
00:42:08,089 --> 00:42:10,299
Un-ass that shit.
Get it outta here!

490
00:42:10,424 --> 00:42:14,429
Get it out. It's just a flare.
It's all right.

491
00:42:14,555 --> 00:42:17,683
- Everybody all right? Lance?
- I'm fine!

492
00:42:32,742 --> 00:42:34,619
Get down!

493
00:42:53,016 --> 00:42:58,314
I'm not going!
I'm not going! I'm not going.

494
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:15,626
<i>We just got a secondary
down there in the plaza. </i>

495
00:43:15,751 --> 00:43:17,837
<i>Hold on to your position. </i>

496
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:21,090
<i>Duke Six, we've got
wounded down there. </i>

497
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:32,521
- Get a stretcher over here!
- You're all right.

498
00:43:37,193 --> 00:43:42,199
- Please, God! Help me!
- Give him some morphine.

499
00:43:42,324 --> 00:43:44,618
My God! Oh!

500
00:43:44,743 --> 00:43:47,956
- Seven-four-two!
- Where's that duster?

501
00:43:48,081 --> 00:43:50,750
I want my wounded out of there
and in the hospital in 15 minutes.

502
00:43:50,875 --> 00:43:52,795
I want my men out.

503
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,005
<i>Somebody stay in there
tight with Big Duke. </i>

504
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:59,386
<i>This is Ten-Ten. We're gonna be in,
throw 'em on and get out. </i>

505
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,662
She's got a grenade!

506
00:44:21,787 --> 00:44:23,247
She's got a grenade!

507
00:44:26,459 --> 00:44:28,169
The whole thing blew up.

508
00:44:28,295 --> 00:44:30,088
<i>- She blew the shit...
- Fucking savages.</i>

509
00:44:32,675 --> 00:44:34,677
<i>- Get a medevac.
- Holy Christ, she's a SAP.</i>

510
00:44:34,802 --> 00:44:36,470
<i>I'm gonna get
that dink bitch. </i>

511
00:44:36,596 --> 00:44:39,850
<i>Get over there, Johnny. Roll
that right skid right up her ass. </i>

512
00:44:42,644 --> 00:44:43,855
We gotta get some air
in these trees.

513
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:46,316
It's goddam eat-up
with enemy down here.

514
00:44:46,441 --> 00:44:48,484
<i>I'm taking fire.
I'm taking hits all over. </i>

515
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:50,863
Three o'clock!
I'm drawing heavy fire!

516
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:53,365
<i>I'm hit! Mayday! Mayday!
I'm goin' in. </i>

517
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:54,950
<i>My tail rotor's out.
I got control. </i>

518
00:45:03,794 --> 00:45:06,756
- What do you think?
- Wow! This is really exciting, man.

519
00:45:06,881 --> 00:45:10,093
- No! No! The waves! The waves!
- Oh, right.

520
00:45:10,219 --> 00:45:13,890
Look at that.
Breaks both ways. Watch. Watch.

521
00:45:14,015 --> 00:45:16,935
<i>Look! Good six-foot swells! </i>

522
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:41,880
Come here, Lance.

523
00:45:45,552 --> 00:45:47,428
Incoming!

524
00:45:50,057 --> 00:45:52,101
This LZ is still pretty hot, sir.

525
00:45:52,226 --> 00:45:54,145
Maybe you ought to surf
somewhere else.

526
00:45:54,271 --> 00:45:55,647
What do you know
about surfing, Major?

527
00:45:55,772 --> 00:45:58,483
You're from goddam New Jersey.

528
00:45:59,902 --> 00:46:02,863
Come here! Come here!

529
00:46:05,074 --> 00:46:07,578
- Change!
- You mean right now, sir?

530
00:46:07,703 --> 00:46:10,497
I wanna see how rideable
that stuff is. Go change.

531
00:46:10,622 --> 00:46:12,500
It's still pretty hairy
out there.

532
00:46:12,625 --> 00:46:14,586
- Do you wanna surf, soldier?
- Yes, sir.

533
00:46:14,711 --> 00:46:17,214
That's good, son,
'cause you either surf or fight.

534
00:46:17,339 --> 00:46:21,051
That clear? Get going.
I'll cover for 'em.

535
00:46:21,176 --> 00:46:24,222
And bring a board for Lance.

536
00:46:24,347 --> 00:46:26,641
We can't do shit
until the boat gets here.

537
00:46:26,766 --> 00:46:30,104
Lance, I'll bet you can't
wait to get out there.

538
00:46:30,229 --> 00:46:32,148
- What?
- See how they break both ways?

539
00:46:32,273 --> 00:46:36,236
One guy can break right, one left,
simultaneous. What do you think?

540
00:46:36,361 --> 00:46:38,405
We ought to wait
for the tide to come up.

541
00:46:38,488 --> 00:46:41,492
- Come here. Look.
- Incoming!

542
00:46:43,995 --> 00:46:48,500
The tide doesn't come in
for six hours!

543
00:46:48,626 --> 00:46:51,712
You wanna wait here
for six hours?

544
00:46:53,757 --> 00:46:57,636
Yo! Chief! Chief!

545
00:47:04,311 --> 00:47:07,856
<i>Okay, fellas, quit hiding.
Come on! Let's go! </i>

546
00:47:07,981 --> 00:47:10,693
<i>- Dick-heads, take off!
- Goddam it!</i>

547
00:47:10,818 --> 00:47:13,321
Don't you think it's
a little risky for R and R?

548
00:47:13,446 --> 00:47:17,493
If I say it's safe to surf this
beach, it's safe to surf this beach!

549
00:47:17,618 --> 00:47:19,870
I'm not afraid
to surf this place!

550
00:47:19,995 --> 00:47:22,874
I'll surf this fuckin' place.

551
00:47:24,876 --> 00:47:27,338
Give me that R-T, soldier.

552
00:47:28,631 --> 00:47:31,717
Dove Four, this is Big Duke Six.
Goddam it!

553
00:47:31,842 --> 00:47:33,929
<i>I want that tree line bombed! </i>

554
00:47:34,054 --> 00:47:36,515
<i>Big Duke Six, roger.
Dove One-Three, stand by. </i>

555
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,518
<i>Blow them into the Stone Age, son! </i>

556
00:47:38,810 --> 00:47:41,729
- Out!
- No, back, no!

557
00:47:41,854 --> 00:47:45,526
Let me take care of this.
Get that out of here!

558
00:47:45,651 --> 00:47:49,113
- I'm sorry.
- Come here now. All right.

559
00:47:49,238 --> 00:47:51,324
- No, ma'am. Sorry!
- Jimmy!

560
00:47:51,449 --> 00:47:53,410
<i>Hawk One-Two, Dove One-Three. </i>

561
00:47:53,535 --> 00:47:56,956
<i>They need some napalm in the tree
line. Can you put it down there? </i>

562
00:47:57,081 --> 00:48:00,042
<i>Right, One-Three. We're fixin'
to fuck with 'em. What's the target? </i>

563
00:48:00,167 --> 00:48:03,380
<i>We're trying to suppress some mortar
fire off the tree line down there. </i>

564
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:05,632
<i>- Roger. Here we come.
- Good. Give it all you got. </i>

565
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:08,261
<i>Bring in all your ships. </i>

566
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:12,140
Put him in my chopper.
Get him back to the hospital.

567
00:48:12,265 --> 00:48:14,476
No, no, no,
you got to go with him.

568
00:48:14,602 --> 00:48:17,438
Come on! Go! Go!
Get it outta here!

569
00:48:17,563 --> 00:48:19,441
Tell my guys I want my board!

570
00:48:19,566 --> 00:48:21,443
<i>Big Duke Six,
this is Dove One-Three. </i>

571
00:48:21,568 --> 00:48:24,946
<i>The jets are inbound now. You got
about 30 seconds to bomb station. </i>

572
00:48:25,071 --> 00:48:28,159
<i>Get your people back and heads down.
This is gonna be a big one. </i>

573
00:48:29,577 --> 00:48:31,622
Don't worry.

574
00:48:31,747 --> 00:48:35,876
We'll have this place cleaned up
in a jiffy, son. Don't you worry.

575
00:48:36,001 --> 00:48:39,422
Give me those shorts.

576
00:48:39,547 --> 00:48:43,260
These are from the Air-Cav,
a present from me and the boys.

577
00:48:43,385 --> 00:48:46,680
I want to see you do your stuff
in 'em out there.

578
00:49:10,124 --> 00:49:12,253
You smell that?

579
00:49:12,378 --> 00:49:14,964
- Do you smell that?
- What?

580
00:49:15,089 --> 00:49:20,178
Napalm, son. Nothing else
in the world smells like that.

581
00:49:20,303 --> 00:49:24,058
Come on. Move it!
Move it! Move it!

582
00:49:24,183 --> 00:49:27,019
I love the smell of napalm
in the morning.

583
00:49:27,144 --> 00:49:29,773
You know, one time we had
a hill bombed for 12 hours.

584
00:49:29,898 --> 00:49:33,193
When it was all over,
I walked up.

585
00:49:33,318 --> 00:49:38,616
We didn't find one of them,
not one stinking dink body.

586
00:49:38,741 --> 00:49:41,787
But the smell...
You know, that gasoline smell.

587
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:46,166
The whole hill smelled like...

588
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:51,423
victory.

589
00:49:55,678 --> 00:49:58,599
Someday this war's gonna end.

590
00:50:12,531 --> 00:50:15,075
- Lance! The wind!
- Huh?

591
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,120
- The wind!
- What?

592
00:50:17,245 --> 00:50:20,290
It's blowin' onshore!
It's gonna blow this place out.

593
00:50:20,415 --> 00:50:23,544
- It's gonna ruin it!
- Not cool! It's gonna blow out!

594
00:50:23,669 --> 00:50:26,589
It's the goddam napalm!
That's what's doin' it!

595
00:50:26,714 --> 00:50:29,593
I know. I'm really sorry, Colonel.
I'm afraid that does it.

596
00:50:29,718 --> 00:50:30,928
The kid's got a reputation.

597
00:50:31,053 --> 00:50:33,431
You can't expect him
to surf those sloppy waves.

598
00:50:33,556 --> 00:50:35,767
- I understand.
- I'm an artist, Bill.

599
00:50:35,892 --> 00:50:40,898
- I couldn't surf that stuff.
- I apologise. It's not my fault.

600
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:42,483
The waves are gettin'
blown out by the napalm.

601
00:50:42,608 --> 00:50:43,651
Don't get me wrong...

602
00:50:43,776 --> 00:50:45,779
It was the bombs causing
a vortex with the wind.

603
00:50:45,904 --> 00:50:47,781
I accept your apology.

604
00:50:47,906 --> 00:50:50,575
But if you could hang
around 20 minutes...

605
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,995
- Some other time, Bill.
- Just 20 minutes!

606
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:56,332
- I'm an artist.
- Keep walking.

607
00:50:56,457 --> 00:51:00,462
<i>Okay, give it a try, guys.
One goes left and one goes right. </i>

608
00:51:00,587 --> 00:51:02,465
<i>Look, Lance. </i>

609
00:51:02,590 --> 00:51:04,467
- You through surfing?
- Yeah!

610
00:51:04,592 --> 00:51:06,469
- Wanna say good-bye to the colonel?
- No.

611
00:51:06,594 --> 00:51:08,472
- You sure?
- Yeah!

612
00:51:08,597 --> 00:51:10,933
<i>- Get the fuck outta here.
- It's the napalm. </i>

613
00:51:11,058 --> 00:51:13,310
<i>Just wait 20 minutes! </i>

614
00:51:13,435 --> 00:51:15,563
Damn! Fuck!

615
00:51:15,689 --> 00:51:18,525
They've been lookin' for ya.

616
00:51:19,902 --> 00:51:22,822
- Don't leave without me!
- Where the fuck you goin'?

617
00:51:22,947 --> 00:51:25,616
Here!

618
00:51:27,327 --> 00:51:29,997
Incoming!

619
00:51:30,122 --> 00:51:32,041
That's the colonel's surfboard!

620
00:51:32,166 --> 00:51:34,502
Hey, get the fuck off me!
It's mine!

621
00:51:42,803 --> 00:51:45,348
You fucking Airborne!

622
00:52:16,718 --> 00:52:18,888
- Lance.
- Chef, light up, man.

623
00:52:19,013 --> 00:52:20,556
Come on. Let's get high.

624
00:52:20,681 --> 00:52:22,642
- Wanna smoke?
- Let's do it, man. Light up.

625
00:52:22,767 --> 00:52:26,188
<i>Someday this war's gonna end. </i>

626
00:52:26,313 --> 00:52:29,191
<i>That would be just fine
with the boys on the boat. </i>

627
00:52:29,316 --> 00:52:31,611
<i>They weren't looking for
anything more than a way home. </i>

628
00:52:31,736 --> 00:52:36,700
<i>- Captain?
- Trouble is, I'd been back there... </i>

629
00:52:36,825 --> 00:52:39,870
<i>and I knew that it just
didn't exist any more. </i>

630
00:52:42,332 --> 00:52:45,335
Buddha time. Here.

631
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:49,590
All right, that's great,
you motherfuckers. Yeah.

632
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:56,765
<i>If that's how Kilgore
fought the war... </i>

633
00:52:56,890 --> 00:53:00,770
<i>I began to wonder what
they really had against Kurtz. </i>

634
00:53:00,895 --> 00:53:03,773
<i>It wasn't just
insanity and murder. </i>

635
00:53:03,898 --> 00:53:06,944
<i>There was enough of that
to go around for everyone. </i>

636
00:53:17,748 --> 00:53:20,835
I mean, he never
was hurtin' for pussy.

637
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:25,841
I'm not here. I'm walking through
the jungle gathering mangos.

638
00:53:25,966 --> 00:53:28,886
I meet Raquel Welch.

639
00:53:30,638 --> 00:53:35,644
I make a nice
mango cream pudding.

640
00:53:35,769 --> 00:53:38,981
You know, kind of
spread it around on us.

641
00:53:39,106 --> 00:53:42,819
She's into mangos too.

642
00:53:42,944 --> 00:53:45,447
She's like one limb above me.

643
00:53:45,573 --> 00:53:48,993
- We're both in the jungle here nude.
- Hey, Chief.

644
00:53:49,118 --> 00:53:52,289
- Yeah?
- Here comes that colonel guy again.

645
00:53:54,333 --> 00:53:58,171
<i>You know how hard it is
to find a board you like. </i>

646
00:53:58,296 --> 00:54:00,673
<i>I will not hurt or harm you. </i>

647
00:54:00,798 --> 00:54:03,010
<i>I will not hurt
or harm you. </i>

648
00:54:03,135 --> 00:54:06,013
<i>Just give me back
the board, Lance. </i>

649
00:54:06,138 --> 00:54:09,434
<i>It was a good board,
and I like it. </i>

650
00:54:09,517 --> 00:54:12,979
<i>You know how hard it is
to find a board you like. </i>

651
00:54:13,104 --> 00:54:16,901
<i>- He's a determined motherfucker!
- I will not hurt or harm you. </i>

652
00:54:17,026 --> 00:54:19,445
<i>I will not hurt or harm you. </i>

653
00:54:19,528 --> 00:54:22,324
<i>Just give me back
the board, Lance. </i>

654
00:54:22,449 --> 00:54:24,701
<i>It was a good board,
and I like it. </i>

655
00:54:24,826 --> 00:54:29,499
<i>You know how hard it is
to find a board you like. </i>

656
00:54:29,624 --> 00:54:32,544
<i>- I will not hurt or harm you.
- Jesus Christ.</i>

657
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:35,255
That guy's too
fuckin' much, man.

658
00:54:35,381 --> 00:54:37,341
Do you think
he would have shot us?

659
00:54:37,466 --> 00:54:39,719
He wouldn't have shot us
on the beach...

660
00:54:39,844 --> 00:54:42,597
but he would have shot us
if he saw me taking his board.

661
00:54:42,722 --> 00:54:44,892
<i>Let's go surfin' now
Everybody's learnin' how</i>

662
00:54:45,017 --> 00:54:47,395
Let's get this board
out of my turret.

663
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,729
Sucker.

664
00:54:48,854 --> 00:54:51,274
How am I going to shoot him
the next time he comes around?

665
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:55,822
Hey, Chef, make some room
back there for the board.

666
00:54:57,824 --> 00:55:00,243
Sock it to me, Lance.

667
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:06,875
I wonder if that's
the same chopper.

668
00:55:07,001 --> 00:55:10,171
He's probably got them all over
the river with that recording.

669
00:55:10,296 --> 00:55:12,173
We'll have to hold up here
till dark, Chief.

670
00:55:12,298 --> 00:55:14,343
Don't worry, Lance.
He won't follow us too far.

671
00:55:14,468 --> 00:55:16,178
What makes you say that?

672
00:55:16,304 --> 00:55:18,180
You think that big Cav colonel
wants everyone upriver...

673
00:55:18,306 --> 00:55:19,766
to know we stole his board?

674
00:55:19,891 --> 00:55:21,935
I didn't steal it!

675
00:55:24,062 --> 00:55:25,940
- Captain?
- Hmm?

676
00:55:26,065 --> 00:55:29,152
Just how far up
this river we goin'?

677
00:55:29,277 --> 00:55:34,074
It's classified, Chief.
I can't tell ya.

678
00:55:34,199 --> 00:55:36,202
We're goin' up pretty far.

679
00:55:37,329 --> 00:55:39,539
Is it gonna be hairy?

680
00:55:41,249 --> 00:55:45,421
I don't know, kid.
Yeah, probably.

681
00:55:45,546 --> 00:55:49,301
You like it like that, Captain,
when it's hot, hairy?

682
00:55:49,426 --> 00:55:51,720
Fuck.

683
00:56:01,315 --> 00:56:03,400
Maybe you'll get
a chance to know...

684
00:56:03,525 --> 00:56:05,904
what the fuck you are
in some factory in Ohio.

685
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:10,992
Hey, Chief, I'm gonna go
get those mangos now, okay?

686
00:56:11,117 --> 00:56:13,162
- Take somebody with ya.
- Yeah, I'll take...

687
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:15,498
I'll go with him.

688
00:56:20,128 --> 00:56:22,339
Chef?

689
00:56:22,464 --> 00:56:25,343
- Yes, sir?
- How come they call you that?

690
00:56:25,468 --> 00:56:27,887
- Call me what, sir?
- Chef.

691
00:56:28,012 --> 00:56:32,142
- Because you like mangos and stuff?
- No, sir, I'm a real chef.

692
00:56:32,267 --> 00:56:36,356
- I'm a saucier.
- Saucier?

693
00:56:36,481 --> 00:56:40,403
Yes, sir.
See, I come from New Orleans.

694
00:56:40,528 --> 00:56:44,949
I was raised to be a saucier,
a great saucier.

695
00:56:45,074 --> 00:56:48,286
- What's a saucier?
- You specialise in sauces.

696
00:56:52,333 --> 00:56:55,837
Gotta be a mango tree
here somewhere.

697
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:04,305
Then, I was supposed
to go to Paris...

698
00:57:04,431 --> 00:57:07,225
study at the Escoffier school.

699
00:57:07,350 --> 00:57:12,481
But then I got orders
for my physical.

700
00:57:22,368 --> 00:57:25,204
Hell, I joined the navy.

701
00:57:25,330 --> 00:57:27,916
Heard they had better food.

702
00:57:28,042 --> 00:57:30,461
Cook school... that did it.

703
00:57:30,544 --> 00:57:35,508
- Yeah, how's that?
- You don't wanna hear about that.

704
00:57:37,052 --> 00:57:41,265
They lined us up in front
of a hundred yards of prime rib.

705
00:57:41,390 --> 00:57:44,561
All of us, you know,
lined up lookin' at it.

706
00:57:44,686 --> 00:57:48,482
Magnificent meat. Really!
Beautifully marbled.

707
00:57:51,736 --> 00:57:55,490
Next thing, they're throwing
the meat into these big cauldrons...

708
00:57:55,573 --> 00:57:58,577
all of it... boiling it!

709
00:57:58,702 --> 00:58:02,624
I looked inside, man.
It was turning grey.

710
00:58:02,791 --> 00:58:05,669
I couldn't fucking
believe that one.

711
00:58:05,794 --> 00:58:11,550
That's when I applied for radioman
school, but then they gave me...

712
00:58:50,388 --> 00:58:53,016
What is it?

713
00:58:54,142 --> 00:58:56,020
Charlie?

714
00:59:06,532 --> 00:59:08,576
It's a tiger!

715
00:59:08,701 --> 00:59:13,790
Son of a bitch!
It's a tiger, man! It's a tiger!

716
00:59:13,915 --> 00:59:16,418
Battle stations.
Lance, up front.

717
00:59:16,543 --> 00:59:17,795
- Get on your 60!
- Got it.

718
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:22,633
- Holy shit! A fuckin' tiger!
- Chef, come on!

719
00:59:22,759 --> 00:59:25,804
- Captain, come on!
- Let's hop in and go!

720
00:59:25,929 --> 00:59:28,098
Let's go!

721
00:59:28,223 --> 00:59:30,769
You were right.
Never get out of the boat.

722
00:59:30,894 --> 00:59:33,563
- Bring that 60 forward!
- Why never get out of the boat?

723
00:59:33,688 --> 00:59:37,109
I gotta remember!
Never get out of the boat!

724
00:59:37,234 --> 00:59:39,403
Never get out of the boat!

725
00:59:41,531 --> 00:59:44,534
- How many is it?
- A fuckin' tiger!

726
00:59:44,618 --> 00:59:47,163
- What?
- A tiger?

727
00:59:47,288 --> 00:59:52,711
Yes! I've had it! I've had
the whole goddam fuckin' shit, man!

728
00:59:52,836 --> 00:59:55,422
You can kiss my ass
on the county square...

729
00:59:55,547 --> 00:59:57,466
because I'm fuckin' buggin' out.

730
00:59:57,591 --> 00:59:59,469
I didn't come here for this.

731
00:59:59,594 --> 01:00:02,222
I don't fuckin' need it!
I don't want it.

732
01:00:02,347 --> 01:00:06,727
I didn't get out the goddam
eighth grade for this kind of shit!

733
01:00:06,852 --> 01:00:09,105
All I wanted to do
was fuckin' cook!

734
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:12,401
I just wanted to learn
to fuckin' cook, man!

735
01:00:12,526 --> 01:00:15,404
- You're all right.
- What happened, bro?

736
01:00:17,532 --> 01:00:19,867
You're all right.
You're gonna be all right.

737
01:00:19,992 --> 01:00:23,580
All right?
It's gonna be all right?

738
01:00:23,706 --> 01:00:27,167
Never get out
of the fuckin' boat.

739
01:00:27,292 --> 01:00:30,755
Hi, tiger! Bye, tiger!
Goodbye!

740
01:00:32,465 --> 01:00:34,844
<i>Never get out of the boat. </i>

741
01:00:34,969 --> 01:00:37,680
<i>Absolutely goddam right... </i>

742
01:00:38,806 --> 01:00:41,601
<i>unless you were
going all the way. </i>

743
01:00:46,399 --> 01:00:48,776
<i>Kurtz got off the boat. </i>

744
01:00:49,986 --> 01:00:53,866
<i>He split from
the whole fuckin' programme. </i>

745
01:00:55,659 --> 01:00:58,246
<i>How did that happen? </i>

746
01:00:58,371 --> 01:01:01,374
<i>What did he see here
that first tour? </i>

747
01:01:07,673 --> 01:01:11,178
<i>Thirty-eight fucking years old. </i>

748
01:01:11,303 --> 01:01:13,221
<i>If you joined
the Green Berets... </i>

749
01:01:13,346 --> 01:01:16,225
<i>there was no way
you'd ever get above colonel. </i>

750
01:01:16,350 --> 01:01:20,397
<i>Kurtz knew what
he was giving up. </i>

751
01:01:20,522 --> 01:01:23,400
<i>The more I read
and began to understand... </i>

752
01:01:23,525 --> 01:01:26,071
<i>the more I admired him. </i>

753
01:01:26,196 --> 01:01:28,865
<i>His family and friends
couldn't understand it... </i>

754
01:01:28,990 --> 01:01:32,620
<i>and they couldn't
talk him out of it. </i>

755
01:01:32,745 --> 01:01:36,207
<i>He had to apply three times,
and he put up with a ton of shit. </i>

756
01:01:36,332 --> 01:01:39,586
<i>But when he threatened
to resign, they gave it to him. </i>

757
01:01:43,591 --> 01:01:48,054
<i>The next youngest guy
in his class was half his age. </i>

758
01:01:48,179 --> 01:01:50,766
<i>They must have thought
he was some far-out old man... </i>

759
01:01:50,891 --> 01:01:53,268
<i>humping it over that course. </i>

760
01:01:53,394 --> 01:01:57,982
<i>I did it when I was 19.
It damn near wasted me. </i>

761
01:01:59,567 --> 01:02:01,946
<i>A tough motherfucker. </i>

762
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,199
<i>He finished it. </i>

763
01:02:07,244 --> 01:02:10,789
<i>He could have gone for general... </i>

764
01:02:10,914 --> 01:02:13,793
<i>but he went for himself instead. </i>

765
01:02:16,254 --> 01:02:18,131
Dear Eva...

766
01:02:18,257 --> 01:02:20,968
Today was really a new one.

767
01:02:21,093 --> 01:02:25,932
Almost got eaten alive
by a fuckin' tiger.

768
01:02:26,057 --> 01:02:28,560
Really un-fucking believable,
you know?

769
01:02:28,685 --> 01:02:31,647
We're taking this guy,
Captain Willard, up the river...

770
01:02:31,772 --> 01:02:34,817
but he hasn't told us yet
where we're taking him.

771
01:02:34,942 --> 01:02:36,820
<i>Come on, baby</i>

772
01:02:36,945 --> 01:02:39,322
Thought you might have
heard by now from Elwood.

773
01:02:39,448 --> 01:02:43,202
<i>October 1967.
On special assignment... </i>

774
01:02:43,327 --> 01:02:45,496
<i>Kon Tum Province, II Corps. </i>

775
01:02:45,621 --> 01:02:49,626
<i>Kurtz staged Operation Archangel
with combined local forces. </i>

776
01:02:49,752 --> 01:02:52,129
<i>Rated a major success. </i>

777
01:02:55,258 --> 01:02:57,802
<i>He received
no official clearance. </i>

778
01:02:57,927 --> 01:03:01,640
<i>He just thought it up
and did it. </i>

779
01:03:01,766 --> 01:03:05,020
<i>What balls. </i>

780
01:03:05,145 --> 01:03:08,356
<i>They were gonna nail his ass
to the floorboards for that one. </i>

781
01:03:08,482 --> 01:03:11,069
<i>But after the press
got a hold of it... </i>

782
01:03:11,194 --> 01:03:13,362
<i>they promoted him
to full colonel instead. </i>

783
01:03:14,906 --> 01:03:19,661
<i>Oh, man, the bullshit
piled up so fast in Vietnam. </i>

784
01:03:19,787 --> 01:03:24,334
<i>You needed wings
to stay above it. </i>

785
01:03:50,239 --> 01:03:54,160
This sure enough is a bizarre sight
in the middle of this shit.

786
01:03:55,537 --> 01:03:58,332
Expecting us this time?

787
01:03:58,457 --> 01:04:00,376
Damned if I know.

788
01:04:05,632 --> 01:04:07,551
<i>Hello. Hello. </i>

789
01:04:07,676 --> 01:04:09,804
Jesus...

790
01:04:13,725 --> 01:04:15,978
Wow.

791
01:04:16,103 --> 01:04:20,315
- It goes back up into the truck.
- What?

792
01:04:20,441 --> 01:04:23,153
We gotta get
all that stuff up.

793
01:04:28,242 --> 01:04:30,369
Hau Phat. You ever been
up here before, Chef?

794
01:04:30,494 --> 01:04:32,372
I bet you we can score up here.

795
01:04:32,497 --> 01:04:35,333
Check out the bikes, Lance.

796
01:04:35,459 --> 01:04:38,379
Yamaha, Suzuki. Yeah!

797
01:04:38,504 --> 01:04:41,758
- That's a good one.
- Yeah, Sukiyaki.

798
01:04:41,883 --> 01:04:44,136
Yeah, man.
This is something.

799
01:04:47,181 --> 01:04:49,099
- Please!
- This must be the guy.

800
01:04:49,224 --> 01:04:51,561
Right over there.

801
01:04:51,686 --> 01:04:54,022
Sergeant. Sergeant.

802
01:05:00,279 --> 01:05:02,449
Three drums of diesel fuel,
PBR five...

803
01:05:02,574 --> 01:05:04,367
Come on, man! Move!

804
01:05:04,493 --> 01:05:06,620
We don't have time. One hour.
That's all. What do you want?

805
01:05:06,745 --> 01:05:10,041
- Can I get some Panama Red?
- Yeah, I'll get you Panama Red.

806
01:05:10,166 --> 01:05:13,504
- Sergeant?
- Destination?

807
01:05:13,629 --> 01:05:15,005
I don't have no destination.

808
01:05:15,130 --> 01:05:17,341
I can't do a goddam thing
without a destination.

809
01:05:17,466 --> 01:05:20,929
- Sarge? Sarge?
- I need a destination!

810
01:05:21,054 --> 01:05:23,056
I can't do a thing about it
with a destination.

811
01:05:23,181 --> 01:05:25,935
These guys are with me.
Destination's classified.

812
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:28,395
I carry priority papers
from Com-Sec Intelligence.

813
01:05:28,521 --> 01:05:32,150
Okay, right, sir. Hey, listen,
it's a real big night.

814
01:05:32,275 --> 01:05:35,320
Eight bucks for that...
Hey!

815
01:05:35,445 --> 01:05:37,698
All right. Damn.

816
01:05:37,824 --> 01:05:41,285
- Just give him some fuel.
- You got it.

817
01:05:41,411 --> 01:05:44,373
- Dog starts barking.
- Hey, listen, Captain.

818
01:05:44,498 --> 01:05:47,543
I'm really sorry about tonight.
It's really bad around here.

819
01:05:47,668 --> 01:05:52,340
Just take this over to the man
at the supply desk and you got it.

820
01:05:52,465 --> 01:05:55,636
Would you guys like some seats...
some press box seats for the show?

821
01:05:55,761 --> 01:05:58,222
The show out here.

822
01:05:58,347 --> 01:06:00,767
- Bunnies, bunnies.
- Playboy bunnies?

823
01:06:00,892 --> 01:06:02,727
You got it.
You gonna be here?

824
01:06:02,853 --> 01:06:06,065
Hey, listen, Captain,
on the house.

825
01:06:06,190 --> 01:06:10,069

<i>I love you! </i>

853

- Come on!
- What's the matter?

854
01:08:23,893 --> 01:08:25,812
Come on, baby!

855
01:08:32,153 --> 01:08:34,363
Grease my gun!

856
01:08:41,747 --> 01:08:44,125
I'm ready to powwow, baby!

857
01:08:58,892 --> 01:09:00,937
Come on! All right!

858
01:09:01,062 --> 01:09:03,272
You're cute. I like you.

859
01:09:03,397 --> 01:09:06,527
I'm here, baby! I'm here!

860
01:09:10,572 --> 01:09:13,409
Yeah!

861
01:09:13,535 --> 01:09:15,829
- You fucking bitch!
- Take it off!

862
01:09:15,954 --> 01:09:17,580
Take it off!

863
01:09:17,706 --> 01:09:21,335
Hey, lover!
You want us to come over!

864
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:25,423
- I sure do!
- Sign my centrefold!

865
01:09:27,801 --> 01:09:29,679
Sign my centrefold!

866
01:09:29,804 --> 01:09:32,473
Come on, baby!

867
01:09:32,598 --> 01:09:34,892
Goddam!

868
01:09:45,238 --> 01:09:47,950
Start her up. Hey!

869
01:09:48,075 --> 01:09:52,037
Get out of my way!

870
01:09:52,163 --> 01:09:53,790
Come on!

871
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:00,590
- Will you sign these?
- Let's go! Let's go!

872
01:10:06,346 --> 01:10:09,433
Hurry!

873
01:10:19,570 --> 01:10:21,489
So long!

874
01:11:03,539 --> 01:11:06,375
<i>Charlie didn't get much USO. </i>

875
01:11:07,793 --> 01:11:12,090
<i>He was dug in too deep
or moving too fast. </i>

876
01:11:15,219 --> 01:11:20,142
<i>His idea of great R and R was
cold rice and a little rat meat. </i>

877
01:11:21,476 --> 01:11:24,312
<i>He had only two ways home... </i>

878
01:11:24,437 --> 01:11:27,859
<i>death or victory. </i>

879
01:11:38,830 --> 01:11:41,958
<i>No wonder Kurtz put
a weed up Command's ass. </i>

880
01:11:43,419 --> 01:11:46,797
<i>The war was being run by
a bunch of four-star clowns... </i>

881
01:11:46,922 --> 01:11:51,136
<i>who were gonna end up
giving the whole circus away. </i>

882
01:11:51,261 --> 01:11:54,139
Hey, you know, man,
that was far-fucking-out.

883
01:11:54,264 --> 01:11:57,810
I collected every picture of her
since she was Miss December, Chief.

884
01:11:57,935 --> 01:12:00,856
Hey, Clean, look at that.
She was here, man.

885
01:12:00,981 --> 01:12:03,817
I even wrote to the cunt.
She didn't write me back.

886
01:12:03,942 --> 01:12:05,903
You can really get hung up
on these broads, man...

887
01:12:06,028 --> 01:12:07,906
just like that cat in the delta.

888
01:12:08,031 --> 01:12:10,116
- Yeah, you better believe it.
- What cat?

889
01:12:10,241 --> 01:12:13,204
The one that went up for murder.
He was an army sergeant.

890
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:17,833
<i>Remember? This cat, man...
He really dug his Playboy,  man.</i>

891
01:12:17,958 --> 01:12:19,127
Dig it.

892
01:12:19,252 --> 01:12:22,339
When the thing arrived,
he was there to meet it, man.

893
01:12:22,464 --> 01:12:26,010
Look at these beautiful
fuckin' jugs, man!

894
01:12:26,135 --> 01:12:29,013
Yeah, so anyway,
he was workin' ARVN patrols.

895
01:12:29,138 --> 01:12:32,601
One of them cocky gook asshole
lieutenants and shit...

896
01:12:32,726 --> 01:12:35,855
One day the gook took his magazine
and wouldn't give it back.

897
01:12:35,980 --> 01:12:38,566
He said, "Give me
my magazine back."

898
01:12:38,691 --> 01:12:42,363
Gook say, "You shut up.
I have you court-martialled."

899
01:12:42,488 --> 01:12:44,615
- Typical fuckin' ARVN.
- Yeah!

900
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:48,662
- Then the gook starts to go too far.
- Chef. Take the wheel.

901
01:12:48,787 --> 01:12:52,874
This dude started to stick
pinholes in the lady's tits.

902
01:12:52,999 --> 01:12:54,418
Take the wheel.

903
01:12:54,544 --> 01:12:58,881
He started sticking pinholes
and mutilating the centrefold.

904
01:12:59,007 --> 01:13:01,969
The sergeant said,
"You better not do that to her.

905
01:13:02,094 --> 01:13:04,054
You leave your shitty little
gook hands off of that girl.

906
01:13:04,179 --> 01:13:06,057
Don't do her like that."

907
01:13:06,182 --> 01:13:10,938
- Gook say "Fuck you" in Vietnamese.
- Damn.

908
01:13:11,063 --> 01:13:14,316
The sergeant couldn't
handle it no more.

909
01:13:14,441 --> 01:13:16,695
He just picked up his iron...

910
01:13:16,820 --> 01:13:19,197
flipped it to
rock and roll and...

911
01:13:19,322 --> 01:13:21,366
Boom!

912
01:13:21,491 --> 01:13:24,203
Gave that little zero a long burst
straight through the Playboy mag.

913
01:13:24,328 --> 01:13:27,248
It blew his ass clean
off of the dock.

914
01:13:27,373 --> 01:13:32,629
There wasn't no more lieutenant
that day. That was it for his ass.

915
01:13:32,754 --> 01:13:36,634
- They burn him for it?
- The sergeant? Yeah, man.

916
01:13:36,759 --> 01:13:38,761
They stuck his ass
in the LBJ.

917
01:13:38,887 --> 01:13:42,558
It's too bad he didn't
get no medals or nothin'.

918
01:13:44,935 --> 01:13:46,980
Fuckin' ARVN, man.

919
01:13:47,105 --> 01:13:48,982
They should have killed the fuck.

920
01:13:49,107 --> 01:13:53,279
Should have given
the fucker a Silver Star.

921
01:13:53,404 --> 01:13:58,118
Bummer for the gook though,
ain't it?

922
01:14:02,039 --> 01:14:03,833
<i>Good morning, Vietnam. </i>

923
01:14:03,958 --> 01:14:06,753

927
01:14:15,805 --> 01:14:17,432
<i>He'd like you to hang
your laundry up indoors... </i>

928
01:14:17,557 --> 01:14:18,934
<i>instead of on the windowsills. </i>

929
01:14:19,059 --> 01:14:22,438
<i>The mayor wants you
to keep Saigon beautiful. </i>

930
01:14:22,563 --> 01:14:24,774
<i>Now here's another blast from
the past going out to Big Sam... </i>

931
01:14:24,899 --> 01:14:28,737

01:18:42,409 --> 01:18:45,413
<i>They lost him. </i>

993
01:18:45,538 --> 01:18:47,999
<i>He was gone. </i>

994
01:18:48,124 --> 01:18:51,003
<i>Nothing but rumours
and random intelligence... </i>

995
01:18:51,128 --> 01:18:54,924
<i>mostly from captured VC. </i>

996
01:18:55,049 --> 01:18:59,262
<i>The VC knew his name by now,
and they were scared of him. </i>

997
01:18:59,387 --> 01:19:01,390
<i>He and his men were
playing hit-and-run... </i>

998
01:19:01,515 --> 01:19:04,101
<i>all the way into Cambodia. </i>

999
01:19:08,773 --> 01:19:10,984
I know what I'm doin'.

1000
01:19:11,109 --> 01:19:13,154
I'm goin' to the White House
to have dinner...

1001
01:19:13,279 --> 01:19:15,907
with the president
of the United States.

1002
01:19:16,032 --> 01:19:18,160
That's where I'm goin'.

1003
01:19:18,285 --> 01:19:20,662
Hey, Chef,
put the cover on that.

1004
01:19:22,206 --> 01:19:24,792
Clean.

1005
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:29,965
How long has that kid
been on this boat?

1006
01:19:30,090 --> 01:19:32,134
Seven months.

1007
01:19:32,259 --> 01:19:35,555
He's really specialising
in busting my balls.

1008
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:38,350
Very possible, Captain,
he thinks the same of you.

1009
01:19:38,475 --> 01:19:43,856
- Oh, yeah? What do you think, Chief?
- I don't think.

1010
01:19:43,981 --> 01:19:46,567
My orders say I'm not supposed to
know where I'm taking this boat...

1011
01:19:46,692 --> 01:19:48,570
so I don't!

1012
01:19:48,695 --> 01:19:54,035
But one look at you, and I know
it's gonna be hot, wherever it is.

1013
01:20:02,753 --> 01:20:06,591
We're going upriver about
75 clicks above the Do Lung Bridge.

1014
01:20:10,888 --> 01:20:13,891
- That's Cambodia, Captain.
- That's classified.

1015
01:20:14,016 --> 01:20:18,981
We're not supposed to be in Cambodia,
but that's where I'm going.

1016
01:20:19,106 --> 01:20:21,608
You just get me close
to my destination...

1017
01:20:21,734 --> 01:20:23,653
and I'll cut you
and the crew loose.

1018
01:20:26,948 --> 01:20:29,034
All right, Captain.

1019
01:20:50,517 --> 01:20:52,604
<i>"Dear Son... </i>

1020
01:20:52,729 --> 01:20:55,148
<i>I'm afraid that both you and your
mother will have been worried... </i>

1021
01:20:55,273 --> 01:20:58,527
<i>at not hearing from me
during the past weeks... </i>

1022
01:20:58,652 --> 01:21:02,448
<i>but my situation here
has become a difficult one. </i>

1023
01:21:02,574 --> 01:21:06,161
<i>I have been officially
accused of murder by the army. </i>

1024
01:21:12,710 --> 01:21:16,131
<i>The alleged victims were
four Vietnamese double agents. </i>

1025
01:21:16,256 --> 01:21:20,261
<i>We spent months uncovering them
and accumulating evidence. </i>

1026
01:21:22,055 --> 01:21:27,311
<i>When absolute proof was completed,
we acted... we acted like soldiers. </i>

1027
01:21:27,436 --> 01:21:29,897
<i>The charges are unjustified. </i>

1028
01:21:30,022 --> 01:21:33,735
<i>They are, in fact, and in the
circumstances of this conflict... </i>

1029
01:21:33,860 --> 01:21:36,071
<i>quite completely insane. </i>

1030
01:21:46,583 --> 01:21:51,214
<i>In a war, there are many moments
for compassion and tender action. </i>

1031
01:21:51,339 --> 01:21:54,259
<i>There are many moments
for ruthless action... </i>

1032
01:21:54,384 --> 01:21:56,804
<i>what is often
called ruthless... </i>

1033
01:21:56,929 --> 01:22:00,182
<i>but may in many circumstances
be only clarity... </i>

1034
01:22:00,307 --> 01:22:02,269
<i>seeing clearly what there is
to be done and doing it..."</i>

1035
01:22:02,394 --> 01:22:04,187
<i>- Medevac, come in.
- "directly... </i>

1036
01:22:04,312 --> 01:22:07,858
<i>- Quickly, awake. "
- Alpha, Tango, Tango, Echo, Tango, Alpha.</i>

1037
01:22:07,984 --> 01:22:10,236
<i>- "Looking at it. "
- Request dust-off. </i>

1038
01:22:10,361 --> 01:22:12,447
<i>Three, maybe four KIA 's. Over. </i>

1039
01:22:12,573 --> 01:22:15,784
<i>"I trust you to tell your mother
what you choose about this letter. </i>

1040
01:22:15,867 --> 01:22:18,997
<i>As for the charges against me,
I am unconcerned. "</i>

1041
01:22:19,122 --> 01:22:20,999
<i>Medevac, come in. </i>

1042
01:22:21,124 --> 01:22:25,004
<i>"I am beyond their timid, lying
morality, and so I am beyond caring. "</i>

1043
01:22:25,129 --> 01:22:27,006
<i>Medevac, do you read? Over. </i>

1044
01:22:27,131 --> 01:22:30,594
<i>"You have all my faith.
Your loving father. "</i>

1045
01:22:49,532 --> 01:22:51,659
Jesus.

1046
01:22:51,784 --> 01:22:54,580
No wonder I couldn't
get 'em on the radio.

1047
01:22:54,705 --> 01:22:56,582
What a dump.

1048
01:23:00,545 --> 01:23:02,505
- Hi there!
- How ya doin'?

1049
01:23:02,631 --> 01:23:04,674
Wow. That's a nice
little boat you got there.

1050
01:23:04,799 --> 01:23:06,886
Never seen one
up here before.

1051
01:23:07,011 --> 01:23:09,931
We called in a request
for Medevac. You receive it?

1052
01:23:10,056 --> 01:23:11,934
Medevac? No.

1053
01:23:12,059 --> 01:23:14,394
We passed a downed Huey
with some KIA's.

1054
01:23:14,519 --> 01:23:17,649
- On your way here?
- Yeah.

1055
01:23:17,774 --> 01:23:20,860
- You goin' up this river?
- Way up.

1056
01:23:20,985 --> 01:23:24,782
- Way upriver? Forget it.
- Why?

1057
01:23:24,907 --> 01:23:28,411
We want to send
some people downriver.

1058
01:23:28,536 --> 01:23:30,872
- Just forget it.
- What the fuck was that?

1059
01:23:30,997 --> 01:23:34,543
- We'll be back in a couple of days.
- Yeah, right, you'll be back.

1060
01:23:40,926 --> 01:23:42,803
- Chief?
- Yeah, Captain?

1061
01:23:42,928 --> 01:23:44,805
Why don't you see what
you can do with that engine?

1062
01:23:44,930 --> 01:23:46,849
- I'm gonna look around.
- All right.

1063
01:23:46,975 --> 01:23:50,353
Hey, don't leave without me.

1064
01:24:11,128 --> 01:24:13,797
Hey, soldier, where's your CO?

1065
01:24:13,922 --> 01:24:15,925
Don't ask me, man.

1066
01:24:36,824 --> 01:24:39,077
Give my clothes back,
you asshole!

1067
01:24:42,831 --> 01:24:45,460
Asshole!

1068
01:24:49,005 --> 01:24:51,717
Hey, guys, where's the CO?

1069
01:24:51,842 --> 01:24:56,890
He stepped on a land mine about two
months ago. He got blown to hell.

1070
01:24:57,015 --> 01:24:59,935
- Who's in charge here?
- Charge?

1071
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:02,146
I don't know, man.
I'm just the night man.

1072
01:25:02,271 --> 01:25:05,691
Just do what I'm told. Shit.
I'm just a working girl.

1073
01:25:05,816 --> 01:25:08,403
What about you, fella?

1074
01:25:08,528 --> 01:25:12,032
Hey, Lance, man, I'm telling you
it's gonna jam. You mark my words.

1075
01:25:12,157 --> 01:25:14,911
- Keep it in that condition...
- Get off my back!

1076
01:25:15,036 --> 01:25:17,080
- No, man, I'm telling you...
- Lay off!

1077
01:25:18,581 --> 01:25:22,044
Hey! Hey! Come here!

1078
01:25:22,169 --> 01:25:24,798
Is that your boat?
Come on inside.

1079
01:25:24,881 --> 01:25:27,467
What do you want?

1080
01:25:27,592 --> 01:25:30,805
Come on inside.
I want to talk to you. Come on!

1081
01:25:33,349 --> 01:25:35,434
Get out of the rain.

1082
01:25:35,559 --> 01:25:37,896
Get off me!

1083
01:25:38,021 --> 01:25:40,232
Come on. Cut this shit.
Hey, Chef. Hey, come on.

1084
01:25:40,357 --> 01:25:44,946
Hey, how ya doin', Captain?
I want you to meet some people.

1085
01:25:45,071 --> 01:25:48,784
- I got your ass.
- Your ass is shit.

1086
01:25:48,909 --> 01:25:51,954
Chef, your ass is shit!

1087
01:25:57,585 --> 01:26:01,132
You're a motherfucker, man.

1088
01:26:01,257 --> 01:26:03,884
Goddam, my ear,
you motherfucker!

1089
01:26:06,263 --> 01:26:09,850
- Get him off me, Chef.
- You smart-ass.

1090
01:26:09,975 --> 01:26:12,103
Hey, guys.

1091
01:26:12,228 --> 01:26:14,981
I got you!
I got your ass!

1092
01:26:15,106 --> 01:26:18,527
- You ain't shit, Chef.
- Hey, fellas.

1093
01:26:18,652 --> 01:26:22,656
- You pulled my fuckin'...
- Hey, guys.

1094
01:26:22,781 --> 01:26:26,286
I just made a deal with
the people from Hau Phat.

1095
01:26:26,411 --> 01:26:31,167
I negotiated two barrels of fuel for
a couple of hours with the bunnies.

1096
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:39,343
Whoa. Whoa. Captain!

1097
01:26:39,468 --> 01:26:42,347
Hey! Hey! You shittin' me?

1098
01:26:42,472 --> 01:26:46,017
No, I'm not. Grab a couple of
barrels and get up to that big tent.

1099
01:26:46,142 --> 01:26:48,187
Come on!

1100
01:26:49,313 --> 01:26:51,315
Captain.

1101
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:54,819
You're giving away our fuel
for a playmate of the month?

1102
01:26:54,944 --> 01:26:59,033
Nope, playmate
of the year, Chief.

1103
01:26:59,158 --> 01:27:02,787
Warm 'em up, baby!
Warm 'em up!

1104
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:05,582
Captain, we get in a fire fight
and run out of fuel...

1105
01:27:05,707 --> 01:27:08,210
I want you to tell me
how she was.

1106
01:27:08,335 --> 01:27:13,341
I made a deal for all of us, Chief.
How about you?

1107
01:27:15,970 --> 01:27:19,348
- You got some mamas in there?
- Some what?

1108
01:27:21,518 --> 01:27:25,105
Forget it, Captain.
I'll stay with the boat.

1109
01:27:25,230 --> 01:27:28,818
Hey, Captain!
Give me a hand.

1110
01:27:48,048 --> 01:27:49,925
You know, I got a...

1111
01:27:50,050 --> 01:27:52,137
I got every one
of your pictures.

1112
01:27:52,262 --> 01:27:55,098
I got the centrefold,
the playmate's review...

1113
01:27:55,223 --> 01:27:57,893
the playmate of the year run-off.

1114
01:27:58,019 --> 01:27:59,937
I even got the calendar.

1115
01:28:00,062 --> 01:28:05,319
<i>Hey, oiseau.
How come you got a bird?</i>

1116
01:28:05,444 --> 01:28:08,323
I used to be the bird girl
at Busch Gardens.

1117
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:12,535
- Busch Gardens?
- I used to train birds there.

1118
01:28:12,660 --> 01:28:14,538
You are...

1119
01:28:14,663 --> 01:28:17,750
- You are Miss December, aren't you?
- Miss May.

1120
01:28:17,875 --> 01:28:19,836
Is it coming?

1121
01:28:26,385 --> 01:28:30,139
- Miss December has black hair.
- It's over there.

1122
01:28:30,264 --> 01:28:33,977
He's not one
of my regular birds.

1123
01:28:34,102 --> 01:28:37,982
Come on. Come on, baby. Snack?
Snatch a crack. Come here.

1124
01:28:38,107 --> 01:28:41,444
Being playmate of the year...

1125
01:28:41,569 --> 01:28:45,074
is the loneliest experience
I can imagine.

1126
01:28:46,283 --> 01:28:49,788
It's like...
You try to express...

1127
01:28:49,913 --> 01:28:54,710
your feelings to someone
and show them your heart...

1128
01:28:54,835 --> 01:28:56,712
Yeah, I want to hear
about your bird act.

1129
01:28:56,837 --> 01:28:58,714
I'd love to hear
about your bird act.

1130
01:28:58,839 --> 01:29:02,719
But would you mind
just puttin' this...

1131
01:29:02,844 --> 01:29:07,517
Would you just mind putting
this black wig on for me, please?

1132
01:29:07,642 --> 01:29:10,353
And there's
this glass wall between you...

1133
01:29:10,478 --> 01:29:13,107
this invisible glass.

1134
01:29:13,232 --> 01:29:15,859
They can see
your mouth moving.

1135
01:29:15,985 --> 01:29:18,405
I used to train birds
for at least two years...

1136
01:29:18,530 --> 01:29:20,448
- That's beautiful.
- At Busch Gardens.

1137
01:29:20,573 --> 01:29:23,828
This was cascading over your
right shoulder. This was open here.

1138
01:29:23,953 --> 01:29:27,540
But they can't hear
what you're saying.

1139
01:29:27,665 --> 01:29:31,586
I used to train them to stand
on their head and ride a bicycle...

1140
01:29:31,712 --> 01:29:33,588
Your right hand was...

1141
01:29:33,714 --> 01:29:35,591
Hey, Chef!

1142
01:29:35,717 --> 01:29:38,720
- Get outta here, man!
- Come on!

1143
01:29:38,845 --> 01:29:41,724
- Does he want to talk to you?
- Later. Give me 15 minutes.

1144
01:29:41,849 --> 01:29:45,894
You can never really make them hear
what you're trying to say.

1145
01:29:46,020 --> 01:29:49,065
You okay with kind of bending?
That's it.

1146
01:29:49,190 --> 01:29:51,609
Your ass was sticking out
just a little... Hey, man, fuck off!

1147
01:29:51,735 --> 01:29:53,696
Fifteen minutes!

1148
01:29:53,821 --> 01:29:57,658
That's why I tried
so desperately...

1149
01:29:57,783 --> 01:30:01,246
to show somebody
that I had some talent.

1150
01:30:01,371 --> 01:30:03,290
Little baby macaws.

1151
01:30:03,415 --> 01:30:06,252
- Have you ever seen a baby macaw?
- That's kind of open there.

1152
01:30:06,377 --> 01:30:08,588
- They're all blue...
- Take off, would you?

1153
01:30:08,713 --> 01:30:11,884
I got my rights, man!

1154
01:30:12,009 --> 01:30:14,720
They make you do things
you don't wanna do...

1155
01:30:14,845 --> 01:30:18,350
like, this picture here.

1156
01:30:21,144 --> 01:30:25,483
I started feeling
repulsed with myself.

1157
01:30:25,608 --> 01:30:29,196
You were just kind of bending
forward. Your ass kind of out a bit.

1158
01:30:29,321 --> 01:30:31,948
- I love training birds.
- That's it.

1159
01:30:32,074 --> 01:30:35,453
That's it. That's very...
That's it. Voila.

1160
01:30:35,578 --> 01:30:39,625
You're beautiful.
I just want to...

1161
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:42,628
You know, I can't believe it.

1162
01:30:42,753 --> 01:30:46,966
Me, J. Hicks.
I can't believe I'm really here.

1163
01:30:47,092 --> 01:30:51,681
Maybe I'm unfit
to have a relationship...

1164
01:30:51,806 --> 01:30:56,644
with a beautiful, innocent boy.

1165
01:30:56,770 --> 01:31:00,273
Just think, if it hadn't
been for the Vietnam War...

1166
01:31:00,399 --> 01:31:02,652
I never would have met you,
Miss December.

1167
01:31:02,777 --> 01:31:04,320
Miss May.

1168
01:31:04,445 --> 01:31:09,201
I wish...
I wish I could find...

1169
01:31:09,326 --> 01:31:12,162
just one person...

1170
01:31:13,789 --> 01:31:16,668
that could share
my point of view.

1171
01:31:23,217 --> 01:31:25,261
Oh, you kiss like a bird!

1172
01:31:25,386 --> 01:31:27,597
Oh, God! Kiss me! Kiss me!

1173
01:31:28,598 --> 01:31:29,975
Who is that?

1174
01:31:30,100 --> 01:31:35,732
- You're drivin' me crazy! Kiss me!
- I love birds!

1175
01:31:39,778 --> 01:31:43,450
You finished yet?

1176
01:31:43,575 --> 01:31:46,369
Oh! Fuck!

1177
01:31:46,494 --> 01:31:48,913
Like a bird!
Take me like a bird!

1178
01:31:48,997 --> 01:31:52,209
Fly, baby! Cock it to me!

1179
01:31:52,335 --> 01:31:55,005
- Fly!
- I can fly like an eagle!

1180
01:31:55,130 --> 01:31:57,966
- Fly like an eagle!
- It drives me crazy!

1181
01:31:58,050 --> 01:32:01,220
It drives me crazy!

1182
01:32:09,396 --> 01:32:13,151
Lance, that was somebody's son.

1183
01:32:15,737 --> 01:32:20,034
Lance, there were things
that they made me do...

1184
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:22,244
that I didn't want to do.

1185
01:32:22,370 --> 01:32:26,083
They said, "Pull the ribbons
between your legs."

1186
01:32:26,208 --> 01:32:28,585
I didn't want to do it.

1187
01:32:28,710 --> 01:32:32,423
But they said that was
what was expected of me...

1188
01:32:32,548 --> 01:32:35,301
that that's what people
wanted to see.

1189
01:32:56,993 --> 01:33:00,957
- Who are you?
- Well, I'm next, ma'am.

1190
01:33:01,082 --> 01:33:03,710
Ha, ha! Hell,
I didn't know it was a cherry.

1191
01:33:03,835 --> 01:33:06,505
- Didn't know you never got no pussy.
- Shove it, fuckup.

1192
01:33:06,630 --> 01:33:09,466
Sorry about that. If I'd have
known, I'd take you to New Orleans.

1193
01:33:09,591 --> 01:33:11,970
- Man, fuck you.
- Introduce you to...

1194
01:33:12,095 --> 01:33:15,598
- Lay off, Chef.
- Cherry boy, cherry boy.

1195
01:33:15,724 --> 01:33:17,977
You're a fuckin' dog!

1196
01:33:18,102 --> 01:33:21,313
Come to New Orleans.
I'll get you fixed up, ya prick.

1197
01:33:21,439 --> 01:33:23,316
Lay off, Chef.

1198
01:33:23,442 --> 01:33:25,318
You're the only fuckin' prick
I see around here.

1199
01:33:25,444 --> 01:33:27,320
If I wanna play with a prick,
I'll play with my own.

1200
01:33:27,446 --> 01:33:28,322
Lay off!

1201
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:30,992
What are you gonna
do with it, cherry boy?

1202
01:33:31,117 --> 01:33:32,493
Chef, I said lay off!

1203
01:33:32,618 --> 01:33:36,999
Chef, knock it off! Give him
a break! What do you think I said?

1204
01:33:37,124 --> 01:33:39,043
Then give your jaws a rest!

1205
01:33:39,168 --> 01:33:43,173
This ain't the army.
You are a sailor!

1206
01:33:43,298 --> 01:33:45,508
So get out of that
frizzly army-looking shirt...

1207
01:33:45,633 --> 01:33:47,553
and stop smoking that dope!

1208
01:33:47,678 --> 01:33:49,597
You hear me?

1209
01:33:53,435 --> 01:33:56,063
Lance, what's with
all the green paint?

1210
01:33:56,188 --> 01:33:58,524
- Camouflage.
- How's that?

1211
01:33:58,649 --> 01:34:00,693
So they can't see ya.
They're everywhere, Chief.

1212
01:34:00,818 --> 01:34:04,239
I want you to stay awake up there,
man. You got a job to do.

1213
01:34:21,468 --> 01:34:25,347
Sampan off the port bow.
Sampan off the port bow.

1214
01:34:25,472 --> 01:34:27,892
Let's take a look. Lance.

1215
01:34:28,017 --> 01:34:32,481
Bring them in.
Clean, on the 60. Chef, get a 16.

1216
01:34:32,606 --> 01:34:35,275
Clean, get on that 60!

1217
01:34:37,027 --> 01:34:38,905
What's up, Chief?

1218
01:34:40,365 --> 01:34:42,742
A junk boat, Captain.
We're gonna take a routine check.

1219
01:34:42,867 --> 01:34:46,247
Well, let's forget routine now
and let 'em go.

1220
01:34:46,372 --> 01:34:49,250
These boats are running supplies
in this delta, Captain.

1221
01:34:49,375 --> 01:34:51,795
I'm gonna take a look.

1222
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:53,839
My mission's got priority.

1223
01:34:53,964 --> 01:34:56,801
You wouldn't even be in this part
of the river if it wasn't for me.

1224
01:34:56,926 --> 01:35:00,430
Until we reach your destination,
Captain, you're just on for the ride.

1225
01:35:00,555 --> 01:35:04,268
- Stand by, Lance.
- Come on. Throw the rope, asshole.

1226
01:35:04,393 --> 01:35:07,313
All right. Come on.
Let's bring it over.

1227
01:35:20,454 --> 01:35:23,874
Look in that forward hooch.
Bring the people out of there.

1228
01:35:29,714 --> 01:35:33,052
Come on!
Hurry up, motherfucker!

1229
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:35,929
<i>Can couc,  you too.</i>

1230
01:35:36,055 --> 01:35:38,349
- Keep your eyes open, Clean.
- I got you, Chief.

1231
01:35:42,646 --> 01:35:44,982
It's clear, Chief.

1232
01:35:49,738 --> 01:35:53,868
Okay, that's them.
That's them. They're okay.

1233
01:35:53,993 --> 01:35:56,662
- Board and search it.
- It's just a fuckin' boat.

1234
01:35:56,788 --> 01:35:58,664
- There ain't nothin' on it.
- Board it and search it.

1235
01:35:58,790 --> 01:36:02,002
Just some baskets and
some ducks, fuckin' bananas.

1236
01:36:02,127 --> 01:36:03,962
- Ain't nothin' on it.
- Chef?

1237
01:36:04,088 --> 01:36:07,884
- What's wrong? Search it.
- There's the goat and some fish.

1238
01:36:07,967 --> 01:36:09,886
- Chef!
- Fuckin' vegetables...

1239
01:36:09,969 --> 01:36:11,889
- Get on that boat!
- There's nothin' on it, man!

1240
01:36:11,972 --> 01:36:13,516
- Get on it!
- All right!

1241
01:36:13,641 --> 01:36:16,936
Move it, asshole!
Goddam it!

1242
01:36:17,019 --> 01:36:19,272
Just some pigs! Look, mangoes!

1243
01:36:19,398 --> 01:36:21,900
- What's in the rice bag?
- Fuckin' rice!

1244
01:36:21,983 --> 01:36:24,404
- Look in there!
- Some fuckin' fish!

1245
01:36:24,529 --> 01:36:29,576
More coconuts.
Rice. Here's rice.

1246
01:36:29,701 --> 01:36:31,912
- What's in that vegetable basket?
- Get out of here!

1247
01:36:31,995 --> 01:36:33,914
Come on!

1248
01:36:33,997 --> 01:36:36,042
Check that vegetable basket!

1249
01:36:36,167 --> 01:36:38,044
- All right!
- Shut up, slope!

1250
01:36:38,169 --> 01:36:41,215
- There ain't nothin' in here!
- What's in the boxes?

1251
01:36:41,340 --> 01:36:43,092
- Look in that rusty can.
- Nothing!

1252
01:36:43,217 --> 01:36:46,011
Just fuckin' rice!
There ain't nothin' on it!

1253
01:36:46,137 --> 01:36:49,307
Check the yellow can!
She was sittin' on it. What's in it?

1254
01:36:52,645 --> 01:36:55,064
Chef!

1255
01:36:58,068 --> 01:37:01,321
Motherfuckers!

1256
01:37:03,657 --> 01:37:06,411
Motherfuckers!

1257
01:37:08,329 --> 01:37:11,792
- Hold it!
- Come on! Let's kill them all.

1258
01:37:11,917 --> 01:37:15,254
- Motherfucking cocksuckers mothers!
- Hold it! Hold it!

1259
01:37:15,380 --> 01:37:17,507
Let's kill all the assholes!
Shoot the shit outta all of 'em.

1260
01:37:17,632 --> 01:37:20,886
- Hold it!
- Why not? Jesus Christ.

1261
01:37:21,011 --> 01:37:24,766
Why the fuck not?

1262
01:37:24,891 --> 01:37:28,145
- Clean?
- I'm good.

1263
01:37:34,903 --> 01:37:36,988
- You okay, Lance?
- Shit! Fuck! Shit!

1264
01:37:37,113 --> 01:37:39,784
- Chef!
- Look what she was hiding!

1265
01:37:39,909 --> 01:37:43,037
- You all right?
- See what she was runnin' for?

1266
01:37:45,665 --> 01:37:47,626
It's a fuckin' puppy.

1267
01:37:47,751 --> 01:37:50,630
It's a fuckin' puppy.

1268
01:37:50,755 --> 01:37:53,007
Give me that dog!

1269
01:37:53,132 --> 01:37:55,051
- Give me that dog!
- No! You're not gonna get it!

1270
01:37:55,176 --> 01:37:58,430
- Give it to me!
- Give me the fuckin' dog, asshole!

1271
01:37:58,555 --> 01:38:01,642
Fuck you! Fuckin' mango too!

1272
01:38:01,767 --> 01:38:03,061
- Chef...
- You want that?

1273
01:38:03,186 --> 01:38:06,898
She's moving behind you.
She's alive. Check her out.

1274
01:38:06,981 --> 01:38:09,693
Chef! She's moving behind you.
Check her out!

1275
01:38:09,819 --> 01:38:13,322
All right. All right.
Come on, Clean! Goddam it!

1276
01:38:13,447 --> 01:38:16,618
She's not dead. She's wounded.
Give him a hand.

1277
01:38:16,743 --> 01:38:18,703
Just take it easy.
Take it easy!

1278
01:38:18,829 --> 01:38:22,125
- Slow down and take it easy.
- Chef, wait a minute.

1279
01:38:22,250 --> 01:38:24,127
- Bring her up.
- Is she breathing?

1280
01:38:24,252 --> 01:38:28,340
She's hurt. She's bleedin'.

1281
01:38:28,465 --> 01:38:30,843
Bring her on board.
We're taking her to an ARVN.

1282
01:38:30,968 --> 01:38:33,805
- What are you talking about?
- We're taking her to some friendlies.

1283
01:38:33,930 --> 01:38:36,850
- She's wounded. She's not dead.
- Get out of there.

1284
01:38:36,976 --> 01:38:38,185
The book says...

1285
01:38:49,031 --> 01:38:52,285
Fuck you. Fuck him.

1286
01:38:52,410 --> 01:38:54,328
I told you not to stop.
Now let's go.

1287
01:39:52,858 --> 01:39:55,986
<i>It was a way we had over here
of living with ourselves. </i>

1288
01:39:57,154 --> 01:40:00,617
<i>We'd cut 'em in half with a
machine gun and give 'em a Band-Aid. </i>

1289
01:40:02,744 --> 01:40:05,081
<i>It was a lie. </i>

1290
01:40:05,206 --> 01:40:07,792
<i>And the more I saw of them... </i>

1291
01:40:07,917 --> 01:40:10,170
<i>the more I hated lies. </i>

1292
01:40:12,089 --> 01:40:15,717
<i>Those boys were never gonna
look at me the same way again... </i>

1293
01:40:16,803 --> 01:40:21,391
<i>but I felt like I knew one or two things
about Kurtz that weren't in the dossier. </i>

1294
01:40:26,772 --> 01:40:30,819
<i>Do Lung Bridge was the last
army outpost on the Nung River. </i>

1295
01:40:35,241 --> 01:40:37,535
<i>Beyond it,
there was only Kurtz. </i>

1296
01:40:42,291 --> 01:40:44,668
- What do you think?
- It's beautiful.

1297
01:40:46,045 --> 01:40:48,089
Huh? What's the matter with you?

1298
01:40:48,214 --> 01:40:50,675
You're acting kind of weird.

1299
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:54,013
Hey, you know that last tab
of acid I was saving?

1300
01:40:55,139 --> 01:40:58,143
- I dropped it.
- You dropped acid?

1301
01:40:58,143 --> 01:40:59,561
Far out.

1302
01:41:01,688 --> 01:41:04,942
Friendly!
Friendly! Friendly!

1303
01:41:10,574 --> 01:41:11,867
Take me home!

1304
01:41:11,992 --> 01:41:13,869
Goddam it!

1305
01:41:13,994 --> 01:41:17,081
- Fucking shore police! Shit!
- Man, you wanna die?

1306
01:41:17,207 --> 01:41:19,125
Don't keep goin'!

1307
01:41:21,504 --> 01:41:23,714
- You fuckin' police!
- Don't leave me!

1308
01:41:23,839 --> 01:41:25,926
Fuck you!

1309
01:41:26,051 --> 01:41:28,136
You'll get what you deserve!

1310
01:41:36,229 --> 01:41:38,315
Is there a Captain Willard
on board?

1311
01:41:38,440 --> 01:41:40,359
- Yeah.
- Captain Willard?

1312
01:41:40,484 --> 01:41:43,822
- Yeah. Who's that?
- Lieutenant Carlsen, sir.

1313
01:41:43,947 --> 01:41:46,616
Get that light off me!

1314
01:41:46,741 --> 01:41:49,703
I was sent here from Nha Trang
with these three days ago, sir.

1315
01:41:49,829 --> 01:41:53,249
Expected you here a little sooner.
This is mail for the boat.

1316
01:41:53,374 --> 01:41:55,752
- Don't know how happy this makes me.
- Why?

1317
01:41:55,877 --> 01:41:58,505
Now I can get out of here,
if I can find a way.

1318
01:42:02,301 --> 01:42:05,721
You're in the asshole
of the world, Captain.

1319
01:42:10,060 --> 01:42:11,854
Captain, where you going?

1320
01:42:11,979 --> 01:42:15,733
See if I can find some fuel
and get some information.

1321
01:42:15,859 --> 01:42:17,944
Pick me up at the other side
of the bridge.

1322
01:42:18,069 --> 01:42:20,114
Somebody go with him. Chef.

1323
01:42:20,239 --> 01:42:22,074
I'll go.

1324
01:42:22,199 --> 01:42:23,784
I wanna go.

1325
01:43:16,304 --> 01:43:18,766
Man, listen
to the music, man.

1326
01:43:18,891 --> 01:43:20,768
Where can I find the CO?

1327
01:43:20,893 --> 01:43:22,771
You came right to it,
son of a bitch!

1328
01:43:25,106 --> 01:43:27,526
Get down here!

1329
01:43:28,820 --> 01:43:31,948
You still got
a commanding officer here?

1330
01:43:32,073 --> 01:43:34,701
- Beverly Hills.
- What?

1331
01:43:34,827 --> 01:43:39,373
Straight up the road, there's a concrete
fucking bunker called Beverly Hills!

1332
01:43:39,498 --> 01:43:42,669
Where the fuck else
do you think it would be?

1333
01:44:17,376 --> 01:44:20,379
- Goddam it! You stepped in my face.
- I thought you were dead.

1334
01:44:20,504 --> 01:44:22,716
Well, you thought wrong,
damn it!

1335
01:44:26,094 --> 01:44:28,264
I told you to stop fucking
with me, didn't I?

1336
01:44:28,389 --> 01:44:30,016
You think you're so bad,
huh, nigger?

1337
01:44:30,141 --> 01:44:32,143
What are you shooting at, soldier?

1338
01:44:32,268 --> 01:44:34,313
What the fuck
ya think I'm shootin' at?

1339
01:44:34,438 --> 01:44:37,191
I'm sorry, sir. There are gooks
out there by the wire.

1340
01:44:37,316 --> 01:44:38,985
But I think I killed them all.

1341
01:44:39,110 --> 01:44:41,196
You ain't shot shit. Listen.

1342
01:44:42,864 --> 01:44:45,868
Oh, shit. He's trying to call
his friends. Send up a flare.

1343
01:44:54,294 --> 01:44:56,589
Think you so bad, huh, nigger?
You think you bad, huh?

1344
01:44:56,714 --> 01:44:58,090
They're all dead, stupid.

1345
01:44:58,216 --> 01:45:01,260
There's one still alive
underneath them bodies.

1346
01:45:01,385 --> 01:45:02,888
Who's the commanding
officer here?

1347
01:45:04,056 --> 01:45:05,974
Ain't you?

1348
01:45:07,685 --> 01:45:09,229
You think you so bad?

1349
01:45:09,354 --> 01:45:13,818
I got something for your ass now,
nigger! I got something for you now!

1350
01:45:15,611 --> 01:45:17,655
He's underneath the bodies, man.

1351
01:45:19,032 --> 01:45:21,201
Go get the Roach for me.

1352
01:45:21,326 --> 01:45:24,914
Go get the Roach, nigger!
Go get the Roach.

1353
01:45:29,335 --> 01:45:31,672
Roach. Roach.

1354
01:45:34,299 --> 01:45:36,260
Got slopes on the wire, man.
You hear 'em?

1355
01:45:37,178 --> 01:45:38,763
Do you hear 'em?

1356
01:45:41,057 --> 01:45:43,686
Fuck you, GI!

1357
01:45:43,811 --> 01:45:45,354
We'll bust 'em!

1358
01:45:48,108 --> 01:45:50,777
Hey, GI, fuck you!

1359
01:45:54,866 --> 01:45:56,617
Fuck you, GI!

1360
01:45:57,702 --> 01:46:00,247
Fuck you, GI!

1361
01:46:00,372 --> 01:46:02,541
Hear him out there
on the wire, man?

1362
01:46:05,169 --> 01:46:07,964
- I kill you, GI!
- You need a flare?

1363
01:46:12,845 --> 01:46:16,724
He's close, man.
He's real close.

1364
01:46:24,317 --> 01:46:27,820
Fuck you, GI!
I kill you!

1365
01:46:32,284 --> 01:46:34,161
Fuck you, GI!

1366
01:46:39,042 --> 01:46:41,003
GI, fuck you!

1367
01:46:43,214 --> 01:46:45,883
GI! GI...

1368
01:46:51,556 --> 01:46:52,850
Motherfucker.

1369
01:46:53,976 --> 01:46:55,520
Hey, soldier.

1370
01:46:59,983 --> 01:47:01,860
Do you know who's
in command here?

1371
01:47:20,048 --> 01:47:22,552
Holy shit.

1372
01:47:27,182 --> 01:47:30,143
Hey, Chief, man. Two guys
just got blown off that bridge.

1373
01:47:30,269 --> 01:47:33,064
You hang on, man.
You're gonna be okay.

1374
01:47:37,110 --> 01:47:38,946
- What's that?
- Mail, man. Mail.

1375
01:47:39,071 --> 01:47:41,574
Later on the mail.
Watch them trees.

1376
01:47:43,826 --> 01:47:46,580
There's no diesel fuel,
but I picked up some ammo.

1377
01:47:46,705 --> 01:47:48,331
Let's move out.

1378
01:47:48,456 --> 01:47:52,211
- Did you find the CO, Captain?
- There's no fucking CO here.

1379
01:47:54,297 --> 01:47:56,550
Let's just get goin'.

1380
01:47:56,633 --> 01:47:58,552
Which way, Captain?

1381
01:48:04,225 --> 01:48:06,978
You know which way, Chief.

1382
01:48:07,103 --> 01:48:09,815
You're on your own, Captain.

1383
01:48:09,940 --> 01:48:11,317
Still wanna go on?

1384
01:48:11,442 --> 01:48:13,027
It's like this bridge.

1385
01:48:13,152 --> 01:48:16,239
We build it every night, Charlie
blows it right back up again...

1386
01:48:16,364 --> 01:48:18,867
just so the generals
can say the road's open.

1387
01:48:18,992 --> 01:48:20,703
Think about it.

1388
01:48:24,207 --> 01:48:26,960
- Who cares?
- Just get us upriver!

1389
01:48:31,257 --> 01:48:33,510
Chef, on the bow.

1390
01:48:34,761 --> 01:48:36,888
- Stand by, Clean.
- Let's go!

1391
01:49:28,907 --> 01:49:33,204
You got one, Miller.
Jeez, I got some too.

1392
01:49:33,329 --> 01:49:34,873
Whose package is that?

1393
01:49:34,998 --> 01:49:38,294
- Shit, you got another one, Clean.
- No shit? Wait a minute.

1394
01:49:38,419 --> 01:49:41,047
- Is that it?
- That's it for you. Lance.

1395
01:49:41,882 --> 01:49:45,635
Mr. L.B. Johnson,
there you go.

1396
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:49,223
Far out, man. All right.
I've been waitin' for this one.

1397
01:49:49,348 --> 01:49:52,643
I got another one.
I got a box from Eva.

1398
01:49:52,769 --> 01:49:55,147
"Lance.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

1399
01:49:55,272 --> 01:49:58,818
Sue and I went tripping in Disneyland.
Sue skinned her knee."

1400
01:49:58,943 --> 01:50:01,321
Man, I wanna get back
to Antoine's.

1401
01:50:01,446 --> 01:50:05,701
"I remember the time we went up to..."
How could I fucking forget? Beautiful.

1402
01:50:05,826 --> 01:50:08,579
"There could never be a place
like Disneyland, or could there?

1403
01:50:08,662 --> 01:50:09,830
Let me know."

1404
01:50:09,955 --> 01:50:13,293
Jim, it's here.
It really is here.

1405
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:20,384
<i>"There has been a new development
regarding your mission... </i>

1406
01:50:20,509 --> 01:50:22,846
<i>which we must now
communicate to you. </i>

1407
01:50:22,971 --> 01:50:26,391
<i>Months ago, a man was ordered on
a mission which was identical to yours. </i>

1408
01:50:27,267 --> 01:50:30,939
<i>We have reason to believe that he
is now operating with Col. Kurtz. </i>

1409
01:50:32,649 --> 01:50:36,111
<i>Saigon was carrying him MIA
for his family's sake... </i>

1410
01:50:36,237 --> 01:50:38,656
<i>but they assumed he was dead. </i>

1411
01:50:38,781 --> 01:50:42,786
<i>Then they intercepted a letter
he tried to send to his wife. "</i>

1412
01:50:46,207 --> 01:50:48,125
<i>Captain Richard Colby. </i>

1413
01:50:50,294 --> 01:50:52,714
<i>He was with Kurtz. </i>

1414
01:50:52,839 --> 01:50:55,300
Disneyland.

1415
01:50:55,425 --> 01:50:57,971
Fuck, man, this is better
than Disneyland.

1416
01:50:58,096 --> 01:51:02,517
"Charles Miller Manson ordered
the slaughter of all in the home...

1417
01:51:02,643 --> 01:51:04,645
anyway as a symbol of protest."

1418
01:51:04,770 --> 01:51:07,189
That's really weird,
ain't it?

1419
01:51:07,314 --> 01:51:10,527
- Purple haze. Look, man.
- Hey, Lance, put away that smoke.

1420
01:51:10,652 --> 01:51:13,905
- I got a tape from my mom.
- Rainbow reality, man.

1421
01:51:14,030 --> 01:51:17,368
Hey, Chief,
get a good whiff.

1422
01:51:17,493 --> 01:51:20,247
Eva can't picture me
in Vietnam.

1423
01:51:20,372 --> 01:51:23,709
She pictures me at home
having a beer watching TV.

1424
01:51:25,168 --> 01:51:26,421
Hey, Lance, man.

1425
01:51:26,546 --> 01:51:28,882
Oh, hot potato,
hot potato.

1426
01:51:29,007 --> 01:51:31,844
<i>I'm so glad you decided
to join the navy. </i>

1427
01:51:31,969 --> 01:51:35,264
Eva's not sure she can have
a relationship with me, you know.

1428
01:51:35,389 --> 01:51:38,101
Here I am,
13,000 fucking miles away...

1429
01:51:38,226 --> 01:51:41,313
trying to keep a relationship
with my ass.

1430
01:51:41,438 --> 01:51:45,151
<i>That's much more than I can say
for some of your friends. </i>

1431
01:51:45,276 --> 01:51:47,278
<i>If this tape is any good... </i>

1432
01:51:47,403 --> 01:51:51,533
<i>I will have Dad and the family
send you a tape of their own. </i>

1433
01:52:03,964 --> 01:52:05,341
Fuckers!

1434
01:52:10,764 --> 01:52:12,892
There! Over there!

1435
01:52:14,769 --> 01:52:16,646
Motherfuckers!

1436
01:52:27,367 --> 01:52:29,244
There. Over there!

1437
01:52:38,505 --> 01:52:42,552
Chef, check out Clean!
Captain, he's hit. Clean's hit.

1438
01:52:42,677 --> 01:52:44,971
Where'd the dog go?

1439
01:52:45,096 --> 01:52:48,183
Lance! Lance!
They got Clean.

1440
01:52:48,308 --> 01:52:51,895
Where's the dog?
We gotta go back and get the dog.

1441
01:52:52,020 --> 01:52:55,191
Hey, Clean. Hey.

1442
01:52:55,316 --> 01:52:57,652
Hey, bubba.

1443
01:52:57,777 --> 01:52:59,780
Bubba, you can't die,
you fucker!

1444
01:53:01,657 --> 01:53:03,200
Hey, bubba.

1445
01:53:03,325 --> 01:53:08,623
<i>And so I'm hoping that...
pretty soon... not too soon... </i>

1446
01:53:08,748 --> 01:53:13,170
<i>but pretty soon I'll have a lot
of grandchildren to love and spoil. </i>

1447
01:53:13,296 --> 01:53:16,967
<i>And then when your wife get 'em back,
she'll be mad with me. </i>

1448
01:53:19,177 --> 01:53:21,513
<i>Even Aunt Jessie and Mama... </i>

1449
01:53:21,638 --> 01:53:24,893
<i>will come to celebrate
your coming home. </i>

1450
01:53:25,018 --> 01:53:28,564
<i>Granny and Dad are trying to get
enough money to get you a car... </i>

1451
01:53:28,689 --> 01:53:33,235
<i>but don't tell 'em
because that's our secret. </i>

1452
01:53:33,360 --> 01:53:36,072
<i>Anyhow, do the right thing... </i>

1453
01:53:36,197 --> 01:53:38,575
<i>stay out of the way
of the bullets... </i>

1454
01:53:38,700 --> 01:53:42,747
<i>and bring your heinie home
all in one piece... </i>

1455
01:53:42,872 --> 01:53:45,124
<i>because we love you
very much. </i>

1456
01:53:45,249 --> 01:53:47,169
<i>Love, Mom. </i>

1457
01:55:21,112 --> 01:55:22,780
Hold on.

1458
01:55:25,159 --> 01:55:27,036
Throw me the glasses.

1459
01:55:39,300 --> 01:55:41,969
Lance, take a 16 on the bow.

1460
01:55:44,681 --> 01:55:48,311
Chef. Chef.
On the 60.

1461
01:56:10,544 --> 01:56:11,588
Fuck me.

1462
01:57:20,627 --> 01:57:23,088
Cover the captain. Lance.

1463
01:57:23,213 --> 01:57:25,090
Cover the captain.

1464
01:57:42,402 --> 01:57:44,029
They're French.
They're French.

1465
01:57:46,491 --> 01:57:49,202
Pick up that weapon!
Pick it up! Pick it up!

1466
01:57:49,327 --> 01:57:50,913
Stand fast. Captain.

1467
01:58:25,704 --> 01:58:28,290
All right, you men.
Put down your weapons.

1468
01:59:23,228 --> 01:59:25,106
We lost one of our men.

1469
01:59:28,860 --> 01:59:32,949
We French always pay respect
to the dead of our allies.

1470
01:59:35,827 --> 01:59:37,746
You're all welcome.

1471
01:59:40,374 --> 01:59:42,377
My name is Hubert DeMarais.

1472
01:59:44,003 --> 01:59:46,839
This is my family's plantation.

1473
01:59:46,966 --> 01:59:50,052
It has been such
for 70 years.

1474
01:59:51,136 --> 01:59:54,474
And it will be such
until we are all dead.

1475
02:02:06,044 --> 02:02:09,507
Captain, accept the flag
of Tyrone Miller...

1476
02:02:09,632 --> 02:02:12,135
on behalf of
a grateful nation.

1477
02:02:32,284 --> 02:02:35,120
This food is really wonderful,
isn't it? The wine, the sauces.

1478
02:02:35,245 --> 02:02:38,750
I can't believe it.
Hey, can I speak with the chef?

1479
02:02:38,875 --> 02:02:41,085
The chef speak
only Vietnamese.

1480
02:02:41,210 --> 02:02:44,965
No kidding? He cooks like this
and he can't even speak French?

1481
02:02:45,090 --> 02:02:48,136
Hey, Lance,
the chef's a slope.

1482
02:03:20,507 --> 02:03:24,136
This is Baudelaire.
It's a very cruel poem for children.

1483
02:03:24,261 --> 02:03:28,140
But they need it, 'cause
life sometimes is very cruel.

1484
02:03:29,226 --> 02:03:31,144
As you can see.

1485
02:03:34,899 --> 02:03:36,985
Attack repels by the family.

1486
02:03:37,110 --> 02:03:39,112
Just for this war.

1487
02:03:39,237 --> 02:03:43,659
Vietcong, 58.
North Vietnamese, 12.

1488
02:03:43,784 --> 02:03:46,913
South Vietnamese, 11.

1489
02:03:47,038 --> 02:03:48,957
Americans, six?

1490
02:03:50,291 --> 02:03:53,671
Yes. Well, there were
perhaps mistakes.

1491
02:04:14,570 --> 02:04:17,198
May I present Captain Willard.
He is of a paratroop regiment.

1492
02:04:17,324 --> 02:04:19,492
Madame Sarrault.

1493
02:04:19,617 --> 02:04:20,995
Captain.

1494
02:04:47,692 --> 02:04:49,904
Oh, I'm sorry, Captain.
It was just a little story...

1495
02:04:50,029 --> 02:04:52,365
about Paris and people
starving during the war.

1496
02:04:52,490 --> 02:04:55,201
They are all around the table, and
there was a silence and somebody say...

1497
02:04:55,326 --> 02:04:57,329
"An angel is passing by."

1498
02:04:57,454 --> 02:05:00,707
So somebody said,
"Let's eat it."

1499
02:05:00,832 --> 02:05:02,126
Oh.

1500
02:05:07,758 --> 02:05:11,470
How long can you
possibly stay here?

1501
02:05:11,595 --> 02:05:14,224
We stay forever.

1502
02:05:14,349 --> 02:05:16,226
No, no. I mean...

1503
02:05:17,477 --> 02:05:19,480
why don't you go
back home to France?

1504
02:05:20,523 --> 02:05:24,443
- Back home?
- I mean, this is our home, Captain.

1505
02:05:24,568 --> 02:05:26,154
Sooner or later, you're...

1506
02:05:28,990 --> 02:05:31,077
You don't understand
our mentality...

1507
02:05:31,202 --> 02:05:33,579
the French officer mentality!

1508
02:05:33,705 --> 02:05:35,915
At first, we lose
in Second World War.

1509
02:05:36,040 --> 02:05:39,086
I don't say that you
Americans win, but we lose.

1510
02:05:39,211 --> 02:05:40,212
Oh, Papa...

1511
02:05:41,338 --> 02:05:44,134
In Dien Bien Phu, we lose.
In Algeria, we lose.

1512
02:05:44,259 --> 02:05:46,636
In Indochina, we lose!

1513
02:05:46,761 --> 02:05:49,473
But here we don't lose!

1514
02:05:49,598 --> 02:05:52,601
This piece of earth,
we keep it.

1515
02:05:52,727 --> 02:05:54,604
We will never lose it.
Never!

1516
02:06:00,403 --> 02:06:02,238
You Americans.

1517
02:06:03,698 --> 02:06:08,120
In 1945, yeah...

1518
02:06:08,245 --> 02:06:12,751
after the Japanese war,
your President Roosevelt...

1519
02:06:12,876 --> 02:06:16,087
didn't want the French people
to stay in Indochina.

1520
02:06:17,757 --> 02:06:19,717
So...

1521
02:06:19,800 --> 02:06:22,762
you Americans implant
the Vietminh.

1522
02:06:24,473 --> 02:06:25,724
What's he mean?

1523
02:06:25,807 --> 02:06:29,228
Yeah, that's true. The Vietcong
were invented by the Americans.

1524
02:06:30,396 --> 02:06:31,606
The Americans?

1525
02:06:32,482 --> 02:06:34,985
And now you take
the French place...

1526
02:06:35,110 --> 02:06:37,237
and the Vietminh fight you.

1527
02:06:37,363 --> 02:06:39,239
And what can you do?

1528
02:06:39,365 --> 02:06:41,659
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.

1529
02:06:41,785 --> 02:06:45,330
The Vietnamese are very intelligent.
You never know what they think.

1530
02:06:45,455 --> 02:06:49,168
The Russian ones who help them,
"Come and give us their money.

1531
02:06:49,293 --> 02:06:53,131
We are all Communists. Chinese,
give us guns. We are all brothers."

1532
02:06:53,256 --> 02:06:55,175
They hate the Chinese!

1533
02:06:55,300 --> 02:07:00,139
Maybe they hate the American
less than the Russian and the Chinese.

1534
02:07:00,264 --> 02:07:02,475
I mean, if tomorrow
the Vietnamese are Communists...

1535
02:07:02,600 --> 02:07:04,478
they will be Vietnamese Communists.

1536
02:07:04,603 --> 02:07:07,189
And this is something that you
never understood, you American.

1537
02:07:07,314 --> 02:07:09,191
I don't know.

1538
02:07:09,316 --> 02:07:12,779
Maybe in the future we can make
something with the Vietminh.

1539
02:07:12,904 --> 02:07:15,031
Don't you understand?

1540
02:07:15,156 --> 02:07:17,910
The VC say,
"Go away. Go away."

1541
02:07:18,035 --> 02:07:20,538
That's finish for all
the white people in Indochina.

1542
02:07:20,663 --> 02:07:23,917
If you're French, American,
that's all the same.

1543
02:07:24,042 --> 02:07:27,630
"Go." They want to forget you.
Look, Captain.

1544
02:07:30,007 --> 02:07:33,053
Look, this is the truth.
An egg.

1545
02:07:35,514 --> 02:07:36,724
The white left...

1546
02:07:38,517 --> 02:07:41,604
but the yellow stays!

1547
02:07:48,779 --> 02:07:52,617
When I was in Saigon,
I spoke to an American politician.

1548
02:07:52,743 --> 02:07:55,746
He explained it very well.
He said, "Look.

1549
02:07:55,871 --> 02:07:59,000
Yesterday, it was Korea.
Today, Vietnam.

1550
02:07:59,125 --> 02:08:01,711
Tomorrow, Thailand,
the Philippines...

1551
02:08:01,836 --> 02:08:04,465
then maybe Europe."

1552
02:08:04,590 --> 02:08:07,634
Come on. Why not Europe?

1553
02:08:07,760 --> 02:08:10,055
Look what happened
in Czechoslovakia recently.

1554
02:08:10,180 --> 02:08:13,768
Even before Second World War Americans
knew exactly what was going on.

1555
02:08:13,893 --> 02:08:17,521
They don't want
that shit to take over! LeFevre!

1556
02:08:19,148 --> 02:08:21,276
All you white people are shit.

1557
02:08:21,401 --> 02:08:23,862
They are fighting...
fighting for freedom.

1558
02:08:23,987 --> 02:08:26,240
Freedom? Bullshit.

1559
02:08:26,366 --> 02:08:29,160
French bullshit.
American bullshit.

1560
02:08:29,285 --> 02:08:31,622
Dien Bien Phu,
that serious.

1561
02:08:31,747 --> 02:08:35,626
All soldiers know
they are already dead.

1562
02:08:36,835 --> 02:08:38,922
You know anything
about Dien Bien Phu?

1563
02:08:42,092 --> 02:08:44,011
- Yeah, I know.
- No, you don't.

1564
02:08:45,262 --> 02:08:47,973
- Not really.
- Dien Bien Phu was an error.

1565
02:08:48,099 --> 02:08:49,351
A military mistake.

1566
02:08:49,476 --> 02:08:51,812
A mistake?
A voluntary mistake!

1567
02:08:51,937 --> 02:08:53,563
Voluntary!

1568
02:08:55,650 --> 02:08:59,529
All the soldiers knew.
We knew we would be dead.

1569
02:08:59,654 --> 02:09:02,783
The generals and the colonels believe
it's impossible for the Viets...

1570
02:09:02,908 --> 02:09:05,577
to get the cannon
up there in the mountains.

1571
02:09:05,703 --> 02:09:09,916
But they do. Then they wait
for the rain to come.

1572
02:09:11,459 --> 02:09:16,132
When it comes,
no aeroplane can fly there.

1573
02:09:16,257 --> 02:09:18,552
And our paratroopers
jump at 90 metres.

1574
02:09:18,677 --> 02:09:21,763
I mean, you know,
90 metres... 70 metres.

1575
02:09:21,888 --> 02:09:24,517
I mean, that's crazy.
No army in the world can do that.

1576
02:09:24,642 --> 02:09:28,354
And they only do that
to be dead with their friends.

1577
02:09:35,112 --> 02:09:37,282
The French Army was sacrificed.

1578
02:09:37,407 --> 02:09:39,868
Sacrificed by the politicians
safe at home.

1579
02:09:39,993 --> 02:09:42,788
They put the army in an impossible
situation where they couldn't win.

1580
02:09:42,913 --> 02:09:45,624
The students are
marching in Paris...

1581
02:09:45,750 --> 02:09:47,627
protesting, demonstrating.

1582
02:09:47,753 --> 02:09:50,005
They stab the soldiers
in their back.

1583
02:09:50,130 --> 02:09:53,843
The soldier would open
the grenade, it wouldn't work.

1584
02:09:53,968 --> 02:09:58,056
A piece of paper would fall...

1585
02:09:58,181 --> 02:10:01,351
"Union of French Women."
"We are for the Viets."

1586
02:10:01,477 --> 02:10:05,148
Traitors!
Communist traitors at home.

1587
02:10:07,025 --> 02:10:09,569
Dien Bien Phu, okay.

1588
02:10:09,694 --> 02:10:13,574
The French is shit, huh?

1589
02:10:13,699 --> 02:10:15,951
No one care.
No one want...

1590
02:10:18,580 --> 02:10:21,792
Why don't you Americans
learn from us, from our mistakes?

1591
02:10:21,875 --> 02:10:23,795
<i>Mon Dieux,  with your army,
your strength...</i>

1592
02:10:23,878 --> 02:10:26,172
your power, you could win
if you want to!

1593
02:10:28,592 --> 02:10:30,844
You can win.

1594
02:10:34,224 --> 02:10:37,602
You know, I'm sure
we can make something here.

1595
02:10:37,727 --> 02:10:39,605
I'm sure about it,
you know?

1596
02:10:39,730 --> 02:10:43,150
I never do something wrong
to the people here.

1597
02:10:43,275 --> 02:10:45,821
That's right, but the Communist
at home have never been traitors.

1598
02:11:11,434 --> 02:11:14,103
- Communist!
- Socialist!

1599
02:11:22,280 --> 02:11:25,700
<i>Capitaine,  good night.
He was a Socialist, you know.</i>

1600
02:11:25,825 --> 02:11:29,955
We can stay. I know
that we can stay. We can.

1601
02:11:33,501 --> 02:11:36,880
You know, we always
helped the people.

1602
02:11:37,005 --> 02:11:38,924
We work with the people.

1603
02:11:40,009 --> 02:11:43,262
So we can be friends,
we are agreed.

1604
02:11:55,319 --> 02:11:59,239
See, Captain,
when my grandfather...

1605
02:12:00,992 --> 02:12:03,912
and my uncle's father
came here...

1606
02:12:05,872 --> 02:12:08,501
there was nothing...
nothing.

1607
02:12:09,627 --> 02:12:12,296
The Vietnamese were nothing.

1608
02:12:14,049 --> 02:12:16,384
So we worked hard...

1609
02:12:16,510 --> 02:12:18,429
very hard, and brought...

1610
02:12:18,554 --> 02:12:22,141
the rubber from Brazil,
and then plant it here.

1611
02:12:23,351 --> 02:12:26,480
We took the Vietnamese,
work with them...

1612
02:12:27,356 --> 02:12:29,233
make something...

1613
02:12:29,358 --> 02:12:32,070
something out of nothing.

1614
02:12:32,195 --> 02:12:36,617
So when you ask me why
we want to stay here, Captain...

1615
02:12:38,202 --> 02:12:42,290
we want to stay here because
it's ours... it belongs to us.

1616
02:12:42,416 --> 02:12:44,334
It keeps our family together.

1617
02:12:46,211 --> 02:12:48,131
I mean, we fight for that.

1618
02:12:50,216 --> 02:12:54,555
While you Americans,
you are fighting for...

1619
02:12:54,680 --> 02:12:58,642
the biggest nothing in history.

1620
02:13:05,860 --> 02:13:10,698
I'm sorry, Captain. I will see
if your men need any help to...

1621
02:13:10,823 --> 02:13:12,909
repair your boat...

1622
02:13:13,034 --> 02:13:16,037
so that you can go on
with your war.

1623
02:13:51,747 --> 02:13:54,625
I apologise
for my family, Captain.

1624
02:13:56,210 --> 02:13:58,505
We have all lost much here.

1625
02:13:59,756 --> 02:14:02,550
Hubert... his wife
and two sons.

1626
02:14:07,431 --> 02:14:09,643
And I have lost a husband.

1627
02:14:15,483 --> 02:14:17,235
I understand.

1628
02:14:17,360 --> 02:14:19,904
You are tired of the war.

1629
02:14:21,573 --> 02:14:24,118
I can see it in your face.

1630
02:14:26,161 --> 02:14:30,208
'Twas the same in the eyes
of the soldiers of our war.

1631
02:14:31,668 --> 02:14:35,381
<i>We called them
"Les Soldats Perdus..."</i>

1632
02:14:35,506 --> 02:14:37,716
The Lost Soldiers.

1633
02:14:42,431 --> 02:14:44,976
If you like,
we can have some cognac.

1634
02:14:52,151 --> 02:14:55,237
I have to...
to see about my men and...

1635
02:15:02,496 --> 02:15:05,374
The war will be
still here tomorrow.

1636
02:15:15,636 --> 02:15:17,847
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1637
02:15:25,899 --> 02:15:28,651
I noticed you had
no wine at dinner.

1638
02:15:29,736 --> 02:15:32,865
No, I don't drink wine.

1639
02:15:35,910 --> 02:15:39,998
I do like cognac, but I don't want
any now. Thank you.

1640
02:15:41,291 --> 02:15:43,711
Well...

1641
02:15:43,836 --> 02:15:46,881
then I...
I must drink alone.

1642
02:15:57,143 --> 02:16:00,356
Will you go back
after the war to America?

1643
02:16:06,029 --> 02:16:09,491
Then you're like us...
your home is here.

1644
02:16:26,928 --> 02:16:30,808
Do you know why you can never step
into the same river twice?

1645
02:16:33,060 --> 02:16:36,606
Yeah. 'Cause it's always moving.

1646
02:16:37,774 --> 02:16:41,612
I used to prepare
a pipe for my husband.

1647
02:16:48,036 --> 02:16:52,333
'Twas the morphine he took for
the wounds he suffered in his heart.

1648
02:16:55,670 --> 02:16:59,842
He would rage and he would cry,
my lost soldier.

1649
02:17:03,512 --> 02:17:07,434
And I said to him,
"There are two of you.

1650
02:17:07,559 --> 02:17:10,188
Don't you see?

1651
02:17:10,313 --> 02:17:14,192
One that kills
and one that loves."

1652
02:17:16,153 --> 02:17:18,322
And he said to me...

1653
02:17:18,447 --> 02:17:23,161
"I don't know whether
I'm an animal or a god."

1654
02:17:25,705 --> 02:17:27,583
But you are both.

1655
02:18:09,590 --> 02:18:11,467
You want more?

1656
02:18:16,890 --> 02:18:20,603
All that matters
is that you're alive.

1657
02:18:22,313 --> 02:18:25,066
You are alive, Captain.

1658
02:18:28,654 --> 02:18:30,906
That's the truth.

1659
02:19:44,034 --> 02:19:46,829
There are two of you,
don't you see?

1660
02:19:48,873 --> 02:19:51,376
One that kills...

1661
02:19:51,501 --> 02:19:53,838
and one that loves.

1662
02:20:22,413 --> 02:20:25,291
Can't see nothing.
We stoppin'.

1663
02:20:25,416 --> 02:20:27,961
You're not authorised
to stop this boat, Chief.

1664
02:20:28,086 --> 02:20:31,548
I said I can't see a thing, Captain.
I'm stopping this boat.

1665
02:20:31,673 --> 02:20:33,550
I ain't riskin'
no more lives.

1666
02:20:33,676 --> 02:20:36,387
I'm in command here, goddam it.
You'll do what I say.

1667
02:20:38,181 --> 02:20:40,058
You see anything, Chef?

1668
02:20:42,436 --> 02:20:45,189
Why don't they
fucking attack, man?

1669
02:21:03,711 --> 02:21:05,838
Watch it over here, Chief.

1670
02:21:06,797 --> 02:21:08,759
Got a stump.

1671
02:21:11,637 --> 02:21:13,347
On the fifties.

1672
02:21:13,472 --> 02:21:15,850
<i>He was close. </i>

1673
02:21:17,310 --> 02:21:19,437
<i>He was real close. </i>

1674
02:21:20,564 --> 02:21:24,026
<i>I couldn't see him yet,
but I could feel him... </i>

1675
02:21:24,151 --> 02:21:26,071
<i>as if the boat were being
sucked upriver... </i>

1676
02:21:26,196 --> 02:21:29,032
<i>and the water was
flowing back into the jungle. </i>

1677
02:21:31,576 --> 02:21:33,454
<i>Whatever was going to happen... </i>

1678
02:21:33,579 --> 02:21:37,458
<i>it wasn't going to be the way
they called it back in Nha Trang. </i>

1679
02:21:42,589 --> 02:21:44,968
- Arrows!
- Fire!

1680
02:21:47,303 --> 02:21:50,140
Chef, open up! Fire!

1681
02:21:53,352 --> 02:21:55,647
Lance, fire!

1682
02:22:03,364 --> 02:22:07,327
Chef! Chef, it's okay.
Quit firing.

1683
02:22:07,452 --> 02:22:11,081
- They're just little toy arrows.
- Cut it out! Quiet!

1684
02:22:11,206 --> 02:22:14,169
Chief, tell them
to hold their fire!

1685
02:22:14,294 --> 02:22:16,838
They're just little sticks.
They're just trying to scare us.

1686
02:22:16,963 --> 02:22:18,924
Quiet!

1687
02:22:19,049 --> 02:22:21,927
You got us into this mess,
and now you can't get us out...

1688
02:22:22,052 --> 02:22:24,514
because you don't know where
the hell you're going, do ya?

1689
02:22:24,639 --> 02:22:26,766
Do ya?

1690
02:22:26,892 --> 02:22:30,020
You son of a bitch!
You bastard!

1691
02:22:31,564 --> 02:22:33,816
Lance, get the wheel!

1692
02:22:33,941 --> 02:22:38,197
You savages! Come and get it!
You son of a bitches!

1693
02:22:58,470 --> 02:23:00,056
A spear?

1694
02:24:19,607 --> 02:24:22,736
My mission is to make it
up into Cambodia.

1695
02:24:22,861 --> 02:24:25,780
There's a Green Beret colonel
up there who's gone insane...

1696
02:24:25,906 --> 02:24:27,325
and I'm supposed to kill him.

1697
02:24:28,784 --> 02:24:31,704
That's fucking typical!
Shit!

1698
02:24:31,829 --> 02:24:34,082
Fuckin' Vietnam mission!

1699
02:24:34,208 --> 02:24:37,878
I'm short and we gotta go up there
so you can kill one of our own guys?

1700
02:24:38,003 --> 02:24:41,674
That's fucking great!
That's just fucking great, man.

1701
02:24:41,799 --> 02:24:45,971
Shit!
That's fuckin' crazy.

1702
02:24:46,055 --> 02:24:49,016
I mean, I thought you were
going in to blow up a bridge...

1703
02:24:49,141 --> 02:24:52,437
or some fuckin'
railroad tracks or somethin'.

1704
02:24:52,562 --> 02:24:54,981
- That's all right.
- No. No, wait. Wait.

1705
02:24:55,106 --> 02:24:58,444
We'll go together, on the boat.
We'll go with you.

1706
02:24:58,569 --> 02:25:02,991
We'll go up there,
but on the boat. Okay?

1707
02:26:09,068 --> 02:26:11,530
<i>Part of me was afraid
of what I would find... </i>

1708
02:26:11,655 --> 02:26:14,074
<i>and what I would do
when I got there. </i>

1709
02:26:16,035 --> 02:26:18,872
<i>I knew the risks... </i>

1710
02:26:18,997 --> 02:26:21,291
<i>or imagined I knew. </i>

1711
02:26:23,211 --> 02:26:25,755
<i>But the thing
I felt the most... </i>

1712
02:26:25,880 --> 02:26:28,967
<i>much stronger than fear... </i>

1713
02:26:29,092 --> 02:26:31,803
<i>was the desire to confront him. </i>

1714
02:27:43,637 --> 02:27:45,682
Just keep movin'.

1715
02:27:45,807 --> 02:27:49,936
Lance, keep your hands
away from the guns.

1716
02:29:16,746 --> 02:29:19,333
It's all right! It's all right!
It's all been approved!

1717
02:29:20,710 --> 02:29:23,755
I ain't comin' in there!
Them bastards attacked us!

1718
02:29:23,880 --> 02:29:28,343
Hey, zap 'em with your siren, man.
Zap 'em with your siren.

1719
02:29:38,564 --> 02:29:40,816
There's mines over there
and mines over there too.

1720
02:29:40,941 --> 02:29:44,112
And watch out. Those goddam
monkeys will bite you, I'll tell you.

1721
02:29:44,237 --> 02:29:47,450
Ah, that's a pretty one.
Move it right in towards me.

1722
02:29:47,575 --> 02:29:49,285
I'm an American.

1723
02:29:49,410 --> 02:29:52,204
Yeah. An American civilian.
Hi, Yanks.

1724
02:29:52,330 --> 02:29:54,791
Hi. American.

1725
02:29:54,917 --> 02:29:57,002
American civilian.
It's all right.

1726
02:29:57,127 --> 02:30:01,007
And you got the cigarettes. And that's
what I've been dreaming about.

1727
02:30:03,009 --> 02:30:05,763
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

1728
02:30:09,808 --> 02:30:11,436
I'm a photojournalist.

1729
02:30:11,561 --> 02:30:14,230
I've covered the war
since '64.

1730
02:30:14,356 --> 02:30:16,901
I've been in Laos,
Cambodia and 'Nam.

1731
02:30:20,279 --> 02:30:24,368
Hoo-wee, baby. I'll tell you one thing.
This boat is a mess, man.

1732
02:30:24,493 --> 02:30:26,745
Who are all these people?

1733
02:30:26,870 --> 02:30:30,667
Yeah, well, they think
you've come to...

1734
02:30:30,792 --> 02:30:32,085
to take him away.

1735
02:30:32,210 --> 02:30:35,381
- And I hope that isn't true.
- Take who away?

1736
02:30:37,549 --> 02:30:40,845
Him! Col. Kurtz.

1737
02:30:40,971 --> 02:30:44,683
These are all his children,
man, as far as you can see.

1738
02:30:44,808 --> 02:30:48,521
Hell, man, out here
we're all his children.

1739
02:30:48,646 --> 02:30:52,276
Could we talk to Col. Kurtz?

1740
02:30:52,401 --> 02:30:56,613
Hey, Mac.
You don't talk to the colonel.

1741
02:30:56,738 --> 02:30:58,616
Well, you listen to him.

1742
02:30:58,741 --> 02:31:01,995
The man's enlarged my mind.

1743
02:31:02,120 --> 02:31:05,791
He's a poet warrior
in the classic sense.

1744
02:31:05,916 --> 02:31:07,793
I mean, sometimes he'll...

1745
02:31:07,918 --> 02:31:09,504
Well, you say hello to him,
right?

1746
02:31:09,629 --> 02:31:12,007
He'll just walk by you
and he won't even notice you.

1747
02:31:12,132 --> 02:31:15,720
Then suddenly he'll grab you and he'll
throw you in a corner and he'll say...

1748
02:31:15,845 --> 02:31:17,847
"Do you know that 'if'
is the middle word in 'life'?

1749
02:31:17,972 --> 02:31:20,851
If you can keep your head when all about
you are losing theirs and blaming you.

1750
02:31:20,976 --> 02:31:23,270
If you can trust yourself
when all men doubt you."

1751
02:31:23,395 --> 02:31:26,482
I'm a little man. I'm a little man.
He's a great man.

1752
02:31:26,608 --> 02:31:29,736
"I should have been
a pair of ragged claws...

1753
02:31:29,861 --> 02:31:32,698
scuttling across floors
of silent seas."

1754
02:31:32,823 --> 02:31:35,034
- I mean...
- Stay with the boat.

1755
02:31:35,159 --> 02:31:39,581
Don't go any... Don't go without me,
okay? I wanna get a picture.

1756
02:31:41,374 --> 02:31:44,712
He can be terrible
and he can be mean...

1757
02:31:44,837 --> 02:31:46,714
and he can be right.

1758
02:31:46,839 --> 02:31:49,843
He's fighting the war.
He's a great man.

1759
02:31:53,263 --> 02:31:55,183
I mean...

1760
02:31:57,727 --> 02:32:01,231
I wish I had words, you know.
I wish I had words.

1761
02:32:01,357 --> 02:32:04,360
I could tell you something like,
the other day he wanted to kill me.

1762
02:32:04,485 --> 02:32:07,197
- Something like that.
- Why'd he want to kill you?

1763
02:32:07,322 --> 02:32:09,699
Because I took his picture.

1764
02:32:09,824 --> 02:32:13,371
He said, "If you take
my picture again...

1765
02:32:13,496 --> 02:32:16,040
I'm gonna kill you."

1766
02:32:16,123 --> 02:32:18,042
And he meant it.

1767
02:32:19,753 --> 02:32:22,422
See, just lay cool.
Lay cool.

1768
02:32:22,547 --> 02:32:24,467
Lay back. Dig it.

1769
02:32:24,592 --> 02:32:27,470
He gets friendly again.
He really does.

1770
02:32:27,595 --> 02:32:30,891
But you don't... you don't...
you don't judge the colonel.

1771
02:32:31,016 --> 02:32:33,686
You don't judge the colonel
like an ordinary man.

1772
02:32:40,485 --> 02:32:43,072
Okay, watch it now.
These are Americans. Americans!

1773
02:32:43,197 --> 02:32:46,033
You can feel the vibe
of this place.

1774
02:32:46,117 --> 02:32:49,496
Let me take your picture. Hey,
could you hold... Hey, hello. Hello.

1775
02:32:49,621 --> 02:32:51,540
Could you hold up
a minute?

1776
02:33:13,608 --> 02:33:14,984
Colby.

1777
02:33:31,128 --> 02:33:32,838
The heads.

1778
02:33:32,963 --> 02:33:35,133
You're looking at the heads.

1779
02:33:35,258 --> 02:33:38,428
I, uh... Sometimes
he goes too far.

1780
02:33:38,553 --> 02:33:41,265
He's the first one
to admit it.

1781
02:33:42,350 --> 02:33:45,269
- He's gone crazy.
- Wrong, wrong!

1782
02:33:46,605 --> 02:33:49,441
If you could have heard
the man just two days ago...

1783
02:33:49,566 --> 02:33:52,195
if you could have heard
him then, God...

1784
02:33:52,320 --> 02:33:55,573
- You were gonna call him crazy?
- Fuckin' A!

1785
02:33:57,701 --> 02:33:59,995
I just wanna talk to him.

1786
02:34:01,372 --> 02:34:04,626
Well, man, he's gone away.

1787
02:34:04,751 --> 02:34:07,462
He's gone away. He disappeared
out in the jungle with his people.

1788
02:34:07,587 --> 02:34:10,675
- I'll wait for him.
- He feels comfortable with his people.

1789
02:34:10,800 --> 02:34:13,678
He forgets himself
with his people.

1790
02:34:15,055 --> 02:34:17,808
- He forgets himself.
- Captain?

1791
02:34:17,933 --> 02:34:20,937
Maybe we should wait
back at the boat.

1792
02:34:21,062 --> 02:34:22,522
- I think you should...
- Okay, Chef.

1793
02:34:22,647 --> 02:34:24,857
We'll go back to the boat
for a while.

1794
02:34:24,983 --> 02:34:27,695
Yeah, stay with Lance.

1795
02:34:50,722 --> 02:34:53,474
This colonel guy,
he's wacko, man.

1796
02:34:53,599 --> 02:34:56,145
He's worse than crazy.
He's evil!

1797
02:34:56,270 --> 02:34:58,647
I mean, that's what the man's got
set up here, man!

1798
02:34:58,772 --> 02:35:01,233
It's fuckin' pagan idolatry.
Look around you!

1799
02:35:02,277 --> 02:35:05,488
- Shit, he's loco.
- Then you'll help me?

1800
02:35:05,613 --> 02:35:08,659
Fuckin' A, I'll help you. I'll do
anything to get out of this joint.

1801
02:35:08,784 --> 02:35:11,996
- Good boy.
- We could blow all them assholes away.

1802
02:35:12,121 --> 02:35:15,917
They're so fuckin' spaced out,
they wouldn't even know it.

1803
02:35:16,043 --> 02:35:20,673
I ain't afraid of all them
fuckin' skulls and altars and shit.

1804
02:35:22,300 --> 02:35:26,180
I used to think if I died
in an evil place...

1805
02:35:26,305 --> 02:35:29,516
then my soul wouldn't be able
to make it to Heaven.

1806
02:35:29,642 --> 02:35:32,854
But now, fuck...

1807
02:35:34,439 --> 02:35:37,360
I mean, I don't care where it goes,
as long as it ain't here.

1808
02:35:37,485 --> 02:35:41,280
So what do you wanna do?
I'll kill the fuck.

1809
02:35:41,405 --> 02:35:44,326
- Get out of here.
- I'm gonna need you to wait here, Chef.

1810
02:35:44,451 --> 02:35:48,748
I'll go up with Lance and
scrounge around, check the place out.

1811
02:35:48,873 --> 02:35:51,292
See if I can find
the colonel, okay?

1812
02:35:52,627 --> 02:35:55,631
Well, what do you
want me to do?

1813
02:35:55,756 --> 02:35:58,884
Here. You take the radio...

1814
02:35:59,009 --> 02:36:03,306
and if I don't get back
by 2200 hours...

1815
02:36:04,849 --> 02:36:07,478
you call in the air strike.

1816
02:36:08,854 --> 02:36:11,566
"Air strike?"

1817
02:36:11,692 --> 02:36:13,568
The code is "Almighty"...

1818
02:36:13,694 --> 02:36:17,072
coordinates zero-niner-two-six-
four-seven-one-two.

1819
02:36:17,197 --> 02:36:19,367
It's all in there.

1820
02:36:20,910 --> 02:36:24,915
Zero-niner-two-six-
four-seven-one-two.

1821
02:36:32,215 --> 02:36:36,178
<i>Everything I saw told me
that Kurtz had gone insane. </i>

1822
02:36:39,849 --> 02:36:41,893
<i>The place was full of bodies... </i>

1823
02:36:42,019 --> 02:36:46,189
<i>North Vietnamese,
Vietcong, Cambodians. </i>

1824
02:36:53,240 --> 02:36:57,578
<i>If I was still alive,
it was because he wanted me that way. </i>

1825
02:37:30,784 --> 02:37:34,497
<i>It smelled like
slow death in there... </i>

1826
02:37:34,622 --> 02:37:36,916
<i>malaria... </i>

1827
02:37:37,041 --> 02:37:38,919
<i>and nightmares. </i>

1828
02:37:40,837 --> 02:37:43,757
<i>This was the end
of the river, all right. </i>

1829
02:37:57,190 --> 02:37:59,442
Where are you from, Willard?

1830
02:38:04,281 --> 02:38:06,742
I'm from Ohio, sir.

1831
02:38:11,707 --> 02:38:14,043
Were you born there?

1832
02:38:14,168 --> 02:38:16,337
Yes, sir.

1833
02:38:16,462 --> 02:38:18,631
Whereabouts?

1834
02:38:18,756 --> 02:38:20,634
Toledo, sir.

1835
02:38:26,683 --> 02:38:29,227
How far are you
from the river?

1836
02:38:35,359 --> 02:38:37,279
The Ohio River, sir?

1837
02:38:39,614 --> 02:38:41,491
About 200 miles.

1838
02:38:49,376 --> 02:38:52,588
I went down that river
once when I was a kid.

1839
02:38:57,093 --> 02:39:00,096
There's a place in the river...
I can't remember...

1840
02:39:00,221 --> 02:39:05,436
Must've been a gardenia plantation
or a flower plantation at one time.

1841
02:39:05,561 --> 02:39:09,691
It's all wild and overgrown now.
But for about...

1842
02:39:09,816 --> 02:39:12,278
for about five miles
you'd think that...

1843
02:39:12,403 --> 02:39:15,865
heaven just fell
on the earth...

1844
02:39:15,990 --> 02:39:18,369
in the form of gardenias.

1845
02:39:34,553 --> 02:39:36,431
Have you ever considered...

1846
02:39:38,266 --> 02:39:40,143
any real freedoms?

1847
02:39:45,274 --> 02:39:49,029
Freedoms from
the opinion of others?

1848
02:39:51,699 --> 02:39:54,994
Even the opinions
of yourself?

1849
02:40:10,012 --> 02:40:14,267
Did they say why, Willard?

1850
02:40:15,810 --> 02:40:20,607
Why they wanted
to terminate my command?

1851
02:40:36,043 --> 02:40:39,547
I was sent on
a classified mission, sir.

1852
02:40:42,508 --> 02:40:46,513
It's no longer
classified, is it?

1853
02:40:53,063 --> 02:40:55,315
What did they tell you?

1854
02:40:57,693 --> 02:41:00,071
They told me...

1855
02:41:00,196 --> 02:41:02,824
that you had gone...

1856
02:41:02,949 --> 02:41:04,826
totally insane...

1857
02:41:06,953 --> 02:41:10,958
and that your methods...

1858
02:41:11,084 --> 02:41:14,003
were unsound.

1859
02:41:17,383 --> 02:41:19,927
Are my methods unsound?

1860
02:41:25,350 --> 02:41:28,979
I don't see any method...

1861
02:41:30,481 --> 02:41:32,359
at all, sir.

1862
02:41:38,491 --> 02:41:41,077
I expected...

1863
02:41:41,202 --> 02:41:43,371
someone like you.

1864
02:41:45,457 --> 02:41:47,501
What did you expect?

1865
02:41:55,093 --> 02:41:57,012
Are you an assassin?

1866
02:42:01,768 --> 02:42:03,520
I'm a soldier.

1867
02:42:06,565 --> 02:42:08,443
You're neither.

1868
02:42:10,153 --> 02:42:13,323
You're an errand boy...

1869
02:42:13,449 --> 02:42:16,118
sent by grocery clerks...

1870
02:42:19,539 --> 02:42:22,292
to collect the bill.

1871
02:43:05,301 --> 02:43:07,220
Why, huh?

1872
02:43:07,345 --> 02:43:11,433
Why would a nice guy
like you wanna kill a genius?

1873
02:43:18,066 --> 02:43:20,276
Feeling pretty good, huh?

1874
02:43:20,402 --> 02:43:21,820
Why?

1875
02:43:23,364 --> 02:43:25,408
Do you know...

1876
02:43:25,533 --> 02:43:28,202
Do you know that the man...

1877
02:43:31,164 --> 02:43:33,291
the man really likes you?

1878
02:43:36,504 --> 02:43:38,589
He likes you.
He really likes you.

1879
02:43:38,715 --> 02:43:43,595
But he's got something
in mind for you.

1880
02:43:43,721 --> 02:43:46,266
Aren't you curious about that?

1881
02:43:46,391 --> 02:43:51,354
I'm curious. I'm very curious.
Are you curious?

1882
02:43:54,191 --> 02:43:57,445
There's something
happening out here, man.

1883
02:44:01,199 --> 02:44:03,536
You know something, man.
I know something that you don't know.

1884
02:44:03,661 --> 02:44:06,497
That's right, Jack.

1885
02:44:06,622 --> 02:44:09,585
The man is clear
in his mind...

1886
02:44:09,710 --> 02:44:12,004
but his soul is mad.

1887
02:44:13,255 --> 02:44:15,759
Oh, yeah.

1888
02:44:15,884 --> 02:44:17,761
He's dying, I think.

1889
02:44:17,886 --> 02:44:20,931
He hates all this.
He hates it.

1890
02:44:21,057 --> 02:44:24,101
But the man's...

1891
02:44:28,106 --> 02:44:30,776
He reads poetry out loud,
all right?

1892
02:44:32,653 --> 02:44:34,489
And a voice...

1893
02:44:35,615 --> 02:44:37,158
a voice...

1894
02:44:39,661 --> 02:44:42,331
He likes you
'cause you're still alive.

1895
02:44:42,456 --> 02:44:47,504
He's got plans for you.
No, no, I'm not gonna help you.

1896
02:44:47,629 --> 02:44:51,509
You're gonna help him, man.
You're gonna help him.

1897
02:44:51,634 --> 02:44:54,345
I mean, what are they gonna say,
man, when he's gone, huh?

1898
02:44:54,470 --> 02:44:59,017
'Cause he dies when it dies, man.
When it dies, he dies.

1899
02:44:59,142 --> 02:45:02,855
What are they gonna say about him? What
are they gonna say? He was a kind man?

1900
02:45:02,980 --> 02:45:06,484
He was a wise man?
He had plans? He had wisdom?

1901
02:45:06,609 --> 02:45:08,487
Bullshit, man!

1902
02:45:08,612 --> 02:45:13,827
Am I gonna be the one that's gonna
set them straight? Look at me. Wrong!

1903
02:45:16,830 --> 02:45:18,998
You.

1904
02:45:23,170 --> 02:45:25,298
Almost eight hours.

1905
02:45:30,262 --> 02:45:32,890
I'm asleep.

1906
02:45:33,015 --> 02:45:36,519
I'm asleep and dreaming
I'm on this shitty boat.

1907
02:45:48,074 --> 02:45:49,493
Fuck.

1908
02:45:53,038 --> 02:45:55,459
Has it been eight hours?

1909
02:45:57,878 --> 02:45:59,880

into the status

offers considerable evidence
that the weight of US power...

two-and-a-half years
after the big build-up began...

1925

is beginning to
make itself felt.

White House officials maintain
the impact of that strength...

1927
02:50:29,780 --> 02:50:32,908
may bring the enemy
to the point where he could...

he may never permit the report

impressed with the findings...

This is dialectics.
It's very simple dialectics.

1964
02:56:17,103 --> 02:56:20,649

What are you gonna do when
you go from here to Venus?

1969

That's dialectic physics, okay.

1970
02:56:32,997 --> 02:56:35,375
Dialectic logic is,
there's only love and hate.

1971
02:56:35,500 --> 02:56:37,460
You either love somebody
or you hate 'em.

<i>I'd know what to do. </i>

1980
02:57:28,854 --> 02:57:31,899
<i>But it didn't happen. </i>

1981
02:57:32,024 --> 02:57:36,196
<i>I was in there with him
for days. Not under guard. </i>

1982
02:57:36,321 --> 02:57:38,657
<i>I was free. </i>

1983
02:57:38,782 --> 02:57:41,994
<i>But he knew
I wasn't going anywhere. </i>

1984
02:57:42,119 --> 02:57:45,707
<i>He knew more about what
I was going to do than I did. </i>

1985
02:57:52,674 --> 02:57:56,929
<i>If the generals back in Nha Trang
could see what I saw... </i>

1986
02:57:57,054 --> 02:57:59,390
<i>would they still want me
to kill him? </i>

1987
02:58:00,975 --> 02:58:03,979
<i>More than ever, probably. </i>

1988
02:58:04,104 --> 02:58:07,023
<i>And what would his people back home
want if they ever learned... </i>

1989
02:58:07,148 --> 02:58:09,694
<i>just how far from them
he'd really gone? </i>

1990
02:58:11,821 --> 02:58:13,781
<i>He broke from them... </i>

1991
02:58:13,906 --> 02:58:16,618
<i>and then he broke
from himself. </i>

1992
02:58:16,743 --> 02:58:20,081
<i>I'd never seen a man
so broken up and... </i>

1993
02:58:20,206 --> 02:58:22,083
<i>ripped apart. </i>

1994
02:58:22,208 --> 02:58:24,878
I've seen the horrors...

1995
02:58:25,003 --> 02:58:27,339
horrors that you've seen.

1996
02:58:28,883 --> 02:58:30,885
But you have no right
to call me a murderer.

1997
02:58:31,010 --> 02:58:34,097
You have a right to kill me.

1998
02:58:34,222 --> 02:58:37,100
You have a right
to do that.

1999
02:58:38,352 --> 02:58:40,938
But you have no right
to judge me.

2000
02:58:47,279 --> 02:58:49,574
It's impossible for words...

2001
02:58:51,284 --> 02:58:52,827
to describe...

2002
02:58:54,788 --> 02:58:58,083
what is necessary...

2003
02:59:00,127 --> 02:59:02,380
to those...

2004
02:59:02,505 --> 02:59:05,008
who do not know...

2005
02:59:05,133 --> 02:59:08,721
what horror means.

2006
02:59:10,556 --> 02:59:11,933
Horror.

2007
02:59:14,728 --> 02:59:17,606
Horror has a face.

2008
02:59:19,901 --> 02:59:23,238
And you must make
a friend of horror.

2009
02:59:23,321 --> 02:59:26,951
Horror and moral terror...

2010
02:59:27,076 --> 02:59:28,953
are your friends.

2011
02:59:29,078 --> 02:59:31,206
If they are not...

2012
02:59:31,331 --> 02:59:35,085
then they are enemies
to be feared.

2013
02:59:35,210 --> 02:59:37,588
They are truly enemies.

2014
02:59:42,302 --> 02:59:46,139
I remember when I was
with Special Forces.

2015
02:59:49,602 --> 02:59:53,607
Seems a thousand centuries ago.

2016
02:59:57,069 --> 02:59:59,823
We went into a camp
to inoculate...

2017
03:00:02,075 --> 03:00:03,660
some children.

2018
03:00:07,540 --> 03:00:10,251
We'd left the camp...

2019
03:00:10,376 --> 03:00:13,630
after we had inoculated
the children for polio.

2020
03:00:15,299 --> 03:00:17,969
And this old man came running
after us, and he was crying.

2021
03:00:18,094 --> 03:00:20,013
He couldn't say.

2022
03:00:22,433 --> 03:00:24,685
We went back there...

2023
03:00:24,810 --> 03:00:28,523
and they had come
and hacked off...

2024
03:00:28,648 --> 03:00:31,192
every inoculated arm.

2025
03:00:32,736 --> 03:00:35,114
There they were,
in a pile...

2026
03:00:35,239 --> 03:00:36,782
a pile of...

2027
03:00:38,409 --> 03:00:40,329
little arms.

2028
03:00:41,580 --> 03:00:44,583
And I remember...

2029
03:00:46,085 --> 03:00:49,130
I-I... I cried.

2030
03:00:49,255 --> 03:00:51,174
I wept like...

2031
03:00:52,760 --> 03:00:55,971
some grandmother.

2032
03:00:57,682 --> 03:01:02,479
I wanted to tear my teeth out.
I didn't know what I wanted to do.

2033
03:01:02,604 --> 03:01:05,691
And I want to remember it.
I never want to forget it.

2034
03:01:05,816 --> 03:01:08,527
I never want to forget.

2035
03:01:08,653 --> 03:01:11,406
And then I realised...

2036
03:01:12,532 --> 03:01:14,493
like I was shot...

2037
03:01:14,619 --> 03:01:17,830
like I was shot
with a diamond...

2038
03:01:17,956 --> 03:01:21,627
a diamond bullet
right through my forehead.

2039
03:01:23,170 --> 03:01:27,050
And I thought,
"My God, the genius of that.

2040
03:01:27,175 --> 03:01:29,553
The genius."

2041
03:01:29,678 --> 03:01:32,431
The will to do that.

2042
03:01:33,933 --> 03:01:38,689
Perfect, genuine, complete,
crystalline, pure.

2043
03:01:40,607 --> 03:01:42,484
And then I realised...

2044
03:01:42,609 --> 03:01:46,406
they were stronger than me
because they could stand it.

2045
03:01:46,531 --> 03:01:49,242
These were not monsters.
These were men...

2046
03:01:49,367 --> 03:01:51,870
trained cadres.

2047
03:01:51,996 --> 03:01:54,623
These men who fought
with their hearts...

2048
03:01:54,748 --> 03:01:56,710
who have families,
who have children...

2049
03:01:56,835 --> 03:01:58,753
who are filled with love...

2050
03:01:58,878 --> 03:02:02,216
that they had the strength...

2051
03:02:02,341 --> 03:02:04,260
the strength...

2052
03:02:07,931 --> 03:02:09,808
to do that.

2053
03:02:09,933 --> 03:02:14,939
If I had ten divisions
of those men...

2054
03:02:15,064 --> 03:02:18,568
then our troubles here
would be over very quickly.

2055
03:02:20,195 --> 03:02:23,324
You have to have men...

2056
03:02:23,407 --> 03:02:25,327
who are moral...

2057
03:02:26,786 --> 03:02:29,080
and at the same time...

2058
03:02:29,205 --> 03:02:31,292
who are able to...

2059
03:02:32,376 --> 03:02:34,295
utilise their...

2060
03:02:36,590 --> 03:02:40,344
primordial instincts to kill...

2061
03:02:40,469 --> 03:02:43,431
without feeling,
without passion...

2062
03:02:44,682 --> 03:02:48,312
without judgment...
without judgment.

2063
03:02:52,691 --> 03:02:56,196
Because it's judgment
that defeats us.

2064
03:03:14,759 --> 03:03:17,972
I worry that my son...

2065
03:03:18,097 --> 03:03:22,017
might not understand
what I've tried to be.

2066
03:03:24,271 --> 03:03:29,402
And if I were
to be killed, Willard...

2067
03:03:30,611 --> 03:03:33,364
I would want someone
to go to my home...

2068
03:03:33,489 --> 03:03:36,827
and tell my son everything.

2069
03:03:39,288 --> 03:03:43,751
Everything I did.
Everything you saw.

2070
03:03:43,876 --> 03:03:47,881
Because there's nothing
that I detest more than...

2071
03:03:48,007 --> 03:03:50,342
<i>the stench of lies. </i>

2072
03:03:52,470 --> 03:03:55,724
<i>And if you understand me,
Willard, you... </i>

2073
03:03:57,601 --> 03:04:00,730
<i>you will do this for me. </i>

2074
03:05:06,223 --> 03:05:09,978
<i>PBR Street Gang,
this is Almighty. Over. </i>

2075
03:05:10,103 --> 03:05:13,983
<i>PBR Street Gang, this is
Almighty standing by. Over. </i>

2076
03:05:15,359 --> 03:05:20,031
<i>PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty
standing by. How do you copy? </i>

2077
03:05:24,744 --> 03:05:28,207
<i>They were gonna make me
a major for this... </i>

2078
03:05:28,332 --> 03:05:31,336
<i>and I wasn't even in
their fuckin' army any more. </i>

2079
03:05:33,589 --> 03:05:37,010
<i>Everybody wanted me to do it. </i>

2080
03:05:37,135 --> 03:05:40,054
<i>Him most of all. </i>

2081
03:05:40,179 --> 03:05:42,600
<i>I felt like he was up there... </i>

2082
03:05:42,725 --> 03:05:45,853
<i>waiting for me
to take the pain away. </i>

2083
03:05:47,938 --> 03:05:50,525
<i>He just wanted to go out
like a soldier... </i>

2084
03:05:50,650 --> 03:05:53,361
<i>standing up. </i>

2085
03:05:53,445 --> 03:05:57,491
<i>Not like some poor,
wasted, rag-assed renegade. </i>

2086
03:06:00,829 --> 03:06:03,915
<i>Even the jungle wanted him dead. </i>

2087
03:06:04,041 --> 03:06:07,295
<i>And that's who he really
took his orders from anyway. </i>

2088
03:06:47,133 --> 03:06:51,012
<i>Come on, baby
take a chance with us</i>

2089
03:06:55,810 --> 03:06:59,982
<i>Come on, baby
take a chance with us</i>

2090
03:07:04,362 --> 03:07:07,407
<i>Come on, baby
take a chance with us</i>

2091
03:07:07,532 --> 03:07:12,746
<i>And meet me at the back
of the blue bus tonight</i>

2092
03:07:12,871 --> 03:07:15,374
<i>Blue bus tonight</i>

2093
03:07:15,499 --> 03:07:18,545
<i>Blue bus tonight
Blue</i>

2094
03:07:18,670 --> 03:07:22,049
<i>Come on, yeah</i>

2095
03:07:24,260 --> 03:07:26,971
We train young men
to drop fire on people...

2096
03:07:27,096 --> 03:07:30,517
but their commanders...

2097
03:07:30,642 --> 03:07:34,188
won't allow them
to write "fuck"...

2098
03:07:34,314 --> 03:07:37,358
on their aeroplanes because...

2099
03:07:37,442 --> 03:07:39,361
it's obscene.

2100
03:09:02,166 --> 03:09:04,043
The horror.

2101
03:09:07,756 --> 03:09:09,091
The horror.

2102
03:14:31,844 --> 03:14:33,847
<i>Calling PBR Street Gang. </i>

2103
03:14:34,848 --> 03:14:38,268
<i>PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty.
Do you read me? Over. </i>

2104
03:14:39,729 --> 03:14:42,398
<i>PBR Street Gang? </i>

2105
03:14:42,523 --> 03:14:44,651
<i>PBR Street Gang,
this is Almighty... </i>
