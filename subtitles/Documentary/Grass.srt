00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:20,140
- Marijuana, the dried leaves and flowers

- is used in the form
of a cigarette.

- Marijuana smoking,
experts point out,

- can make a helpless addict
of it's victim within weeks,

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,360
- causing physical and
moral ruin and death.

00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,360
- Should you ever
be confronted,

10
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:42,000
- with the temptation of taking that
first puff of a marijuana cigarette,

11
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:43,130

you go bughouse, loco, and
want to raise h--- in general."

I'd like to try one just to see

"There's to much Marihuana smoking

Although people around the world have been
smoking marijuana for thousands of years,

40
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,260
the custom only reach the United States
at the beginning of the 20th century,
LAREDO, TEXAS circa 1912

41
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,200
when it arrived in the south west,
LAREDO, TEXAS circa 1912

42
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,500
with the wave of Mexicans
looking for work.

- Badge, please.

45
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,570
To these
poor laborers,

46
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,500
smoking marijuana
was a way to relax,

47
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,970
after a long day of
working in the fields.

48
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,770
But white Americans
along the border,

49
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,810
didn't much like these foreigners
or their strange customs.

50
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:21,190
Marijuana, it was rumored, gave
the Mexicans super-human strength,

51
00:04:21,191 --> 00:04:23,560
and turned them into
blood-thirsty murderers.

ALIEN WEED MAKES
MAN INTO KILLER

53
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:29,520
One evening in El Paso, some white
Texans where allegedly attacked,

54
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,160
by a Mexican that went
crazy on the killer weed.

55
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,390
Moving swiftly the El Paso city council
passed a law banning possession of marijuana.

56
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,460
Supposedly designed
to control marijuana,

57
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:44,970
they law quickly became a way
for the city to control Mexicans.

58
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:52,000
El Paso Ordinance 1914

59
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:54,500
El Paso Ordinance 1914
PASSED

60
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,450
Unlike the people of El Paso,

61
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,890
most Americans had never
even heard of marijuana.

62
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,060
They were more concerned
about the rising addiction,

63
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,340
to opium, morphine, cocaine and heroin,
which were all serious public health issues.

64
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:13,700
But instead of treating drug addiction
as a public health problem,
TREASURY DEPARTMENT
Washington, D.C. circa 1930

65
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:17,700
the federal government put control of these
drugs in the hands of the Treasury Department,

66
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:21,670
who created the Federal
Bureau of Narcotics.

67
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,050
- Rolling!
HARRY J. ANSLINGER
Commissioner
Federal Bureau of Narcotics

68
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:29,350
- This is Harry J. Anslinger, commissioner
of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics.

69
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,580
- Sorry...

70
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:36,360
- The Treasury Department intends
to pursuit a relentless warfare,

71
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:43,430
- against the despicable dope-peddling vulture
who prays on the weakness of his fellow man,

72
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,570
- Hold!

73
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,270
Americas first drug czar
was Harry J. Anslinger.

74
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:56,570
A law and order evangelist, Anslinger
would shape Americas attitude,

75
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,140
toward marijuana for
generations to come.

76
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,359
FAMILY • TEMPERANCE • PLEDGE
GOD BLESS OUR HOME

77
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,990
Like many Americans, Anslinger
was a prohibitionist.

78
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,690
These morally correct citizens,

79
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:14,330
sincerely felt that progress
could only be achieved,

80
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,870
by controlling the depraved
impulses of the masses.

81
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,230
- Swordfish.

82
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:29,450
He believed that if the laws where tough
enough, America could be rid of alcohol.

83
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,680
Put enough people in jail,

84
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,280
and eventually the public
will learn to behave.

85
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:39,430
And he applied this same philosophy
on mounting the government's war on drugs.

86
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,629
Special treasury agent are
part of a massive force,
U.S. WARS ON DOPE

87
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:47,120
created solely to control
the traffic in narcotics.
U.S. WARS ON DOPE

88
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,870
- You got any merchandise
obtaining in Canada or abroad?

89
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,670
- Have you any liquor?
- No.

90
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,700
- Get out of the car and
let's take a look at it.

91
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,850
- Come on.

92
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,780
Move over, J. Edgar Hoover,

93
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:09,320
here come the agents of the
Federal Bureau of Narcotics!

94
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,460
Like J. Edgar Hoover,
Anslinger posed for the cameras,

95
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:17,530
creating the impression he was smashing
one major dope ring after another.

96
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:21,460
But he found it pretty quickly
that policing 48 states,

97
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,640
on a depression-strapped
budget was impossible.

98
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:30,730
His solution was to try to convince the
states to police local drug traffic themselves.

99
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,780
Campaigning tirelessly he *** each
state to sign a join agreement,

100
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,110
to commit state resources
to fighting drugs.

101
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,410
But only nine
states signed on.

102
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:44,150
The other 39 viewed it as federal
interference in their affairs.

103
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,260
It was a major defeat for
the young drug commissioner,

104
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,390
but he wasn't the
type to give up.

105
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,011
NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA circa 1919

106
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:02,370
Meanwhile marijuana, carried
by west Indian sailors,

107
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,080
arrived in port cities
like New Orleans.

108
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,410
Known as 'muggles',
'tea', or 'reefer',

109
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:15,610
it was popular with the jazz crowd
because it made music sound so good.

110
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,580
From here, musicians carried
it up the Mississippi,

111
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,660
to urban centers in the North.

112

Anslinger realized it might
be the answer to his problem.

128
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,130
If he could persuade
white America,

129
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,370
that marijuana was
a deadly menace,

130
00:09:33,371 --> 00:09:35,700
frightened voters might

- it is convinced that he is
hopelessly and incurably insane,

- a condition cause by the drug
marijuana to which he was addicted.

<i>Blow this hay
and get high with me</i>

153
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,800
Determined to get the act passed,

154
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:22,440
Anslinger unleashed a media campaign
to make the public believe,

155
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,540
that this little known plant growing
at the side of little roads,

156
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,570
was the biggest threat
America had ever faced.

157
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,710
Parents beware: your children
homeward bound from school,

158
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,110
are being introduced
to a new danger,

159
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:39,020
in the form of a drug cigarette:
Marijuana!

160
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:44,390
A Chicago mother watching her daughter
die as an indirect result of marijuana addiction,
text from Harry J. Anslinger Radio Address (1936)

161
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:49,690
told officers that at least 50 of the girls
young friends where slaves to the narcotic,

162
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,530
continuing addiction until
they deteriorate mentally,

163
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:56,670
become insane, and turn
to violent crime and murder.

164
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,670
MURDER!

165
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,980
INSANITY!

166
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,910
DEATH!

167
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,980
Extra, extra...

SCHOOLYARD
DOPE FIENDS!

169
00:12:09,926 --> 00:12:13,565
Anslingers campaign was tailor
made for the lurid tabloid press,

170
00:12:13,896 --> 00:12:17,514
and supported by an army of moralist
groups it captured the public's imagination.

171
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,290
Movietone News covering the
world to bring you the news!

<i>He's a man that

173
00:12:25,341 --> 00:12:27,710
<i>that jive will take
you for a dive,</i>

174
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:32,800
<i>One slip you will arrive,
When you smoke that killing jive!</i>

175
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:36,000
America is threatened
by a new drug menace:
FEDERAL T-MEN BARE
SECRETS OF NEW DRUG

176
00:12:36,001 --> 00:12:37,080
America is threatened
by a new drug menace:

177
00:12:37,081 --> 00:12:42,080
Street corner vendors whose stock-in-trade
is the deadly local weed marijuana,

178
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,190
pass it out in cigarette form.

179
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,750
From ingeniously
concealed containers,

180
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:50,950
the reefers go to the waiting
hands of deluded youngsters.

181
00:12:50,951 --> 00:12:54,763
<i>That feeling will arrive
When you smoke that killing jive!</i>

182
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:57,200
A police find a city
backyard full of dope.

183
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,510
This innocent looking weed
is Mexican marijuana,

184
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,400
which when smoked produces
more nightmares than opium.

185
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,680
Captain Mooney of the narcotics squad
will tell us something about it:

186
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:12,920
- The constant use of these marijuana
cigarettes causes temporary insanity.

187
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,059
<i>Yet you smoke
that killing jive!</i>

188
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,820
- Let's go, Jack, I'm red-hot!

189
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,940
Our state voted for the
Uniform Narcotic Act,

190
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:43,000
and so should yours!

191
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:49,850
The propaganda campaign was successful
beyond Anslinger's wildest dreams.

192
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:52,950
One by one, state
after state signed on.

CAPITOL HILL
Washington D.C. circa 1937

195
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,430
- Gentlemen, take your seats.

196
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:05,130
But now, frightened out of their
minds, the American public,

197
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:08,810
demanded that the federal government
assed new laws to fight marijuana.

198
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,010
Terrified voters wanted action,
and their government responded.

199
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:22,350
Without any public debate, scientific
inquiry or political objection,

200
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,820
the Marijuana Tax Act was signed
into law by President Roosevelt.
JUNE 14, 1937

201
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,990
The act prohibited possession of
marijuana anywhere in the United States,

202
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,760
without a special tax stamp
from the Treasury Department,

203
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:37,660
and the Treasury Department
didn't give out any stamps,

204
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,340
effectively making marijuana illegal.

205
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:44,540
Over night a new class
of criminals was created.

206

MARIJUANA

TAX ACT of 1937
PASSED

208
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:04,660
- To the treasury agents of the Bureau
of Narcotics comes the job,

209
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,630
- of wiping out this traffic.

210
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:11,840
- And in 1937, we smashed
ten major narcotic rings.

211
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,510
- Only the cooperation of
an awakened public,

212
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,410
- Can make-would make...
- Ah, to hell with it!

<i>All the jive is gone!</i>

222

The first person to be convicted
was Samuel R. Caldwell,

223
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,780
a 58 year old Denver man,

224
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,820
sentencing him to four years
hard labor at Leavenworth,

225
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,920
judge J. Foster Syme said:

226
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:11,160
"I consider marijuana the
worst of all narcotics."

227
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:14,170
"Under it's influence,
men become beasts."

228
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,130
"In the future, I will impose
the heaviest penalties."

229
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:20,500
"The government is going to enforce
this new law to the letter."

00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,280
NEW YORK CITY circa 1937

231
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,480
- Prohibition cannot
be enforced,

232
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:41,760
- for the simple reason that the majority of
American people do not want it enforced,
FIORELLO LA GUARDIA
Mayor of New York

233
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:47,120
- and are resisting
it's enforcement.

234
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:51,500
- That being so,
the orderly thing to do,

235
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,670
- under our form
of government,

236
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:59,240
- is to abolish a law
which cannot be enforced,

237
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:04,070
- a law which the people of the
country do not want enforced!

238
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:08,180
New York’s prohibition fighting
mayor, Fiorello La Guardia,

239
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,680
was somewhat skeptical of
the government's claims,

240
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:15,090
that marijuana was causing murder,
rape, and destruction of Americas youth.

241
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,990
Wanting to get the facts,
he commissioned a study,

242
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:21,060
by a group of 31
impartial scientists.

243
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:36,370
After six years of medical and
sociological research,

244
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,310
the La Guardia
commission found:

245
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,020
Smoking marijuana did not lead to
violent or anti-social behavior;

246
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:47,920
Smoking marijuana did not cause
uncontrollable sexual urges;

247
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:53,170
Smoking marijuana did not alter a
persons basic personality structure.

248
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,930
Item by item, the commission’s report disproved,

249
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:00,830
every negative effect
claimed by Harry Anslinger.

THE MARIJUANA PROBLEM
IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK

251
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,640
Furious, Anslinger used
his influence with the press,

252
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,040
to have the
report discredited,

253
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,680
and destroyed every copy
he could get his hands on.

254
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:14,320
And by restricting the
supply of marijuana,

255
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:16,650
he put a stop to any
further research.

256
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,330
Not taking any chances,

257
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,070
Anslinger ordered his men
to dig up dirt on anyone,

258
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:35,540
who disagreed with him,

259
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,240
and going on the offensive, he targeted
the entertainment industry,

260
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:41,040
which he saw as a degenerate
moral influence.

269
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,780
the Hollywood studios agreed to
give Anslinger personal control,

270
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:55,490
over all movie scripts
that mentioned drugs.

271
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,950
And movies he felt sent
the wrong message,

272
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,720
were just banned.

of ice cream cones
and chocolate sodas.

283

Youth is a time
for getting a job,

00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,800
for finding one's
place in the world.

285
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:51,140
But sometimes, in
these troubled days,

286
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,310
the very thoughtlessness of youth
has led to a living nightmare:

287
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,710
Addiction to drugs.

288
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,420
- What's that?
- H.

289
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,980
- H? What's H?
- Shhh! Not so loud.

290
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:11,190
- It's heroin.
- Will it make me sick like the reefers did?

291
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,390
Marty's story is like
many of the others.

292
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,500
It started with
marijuana cigarettes.

293
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:19,830
- Come on, it's my turn next!
- Gee Duke, where did you get them?

294
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:23,400
- I... I know a guy.
- Three for a buck.

295
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,110
- Let me try.

296
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,670
He was determined to be one
of the gang, if it killed him.

297
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,810
And it almost did.

298
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:34,080
Several weeks later,
after smoking reefers,

299
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:39,220
Marty's befogged brain hit on a
clever way to open pop bottles.

300
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:47,430
Later Stan went to the hospital,
for swallowing broken glass.

00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:53,530
Marty badly cut the inside of his mouth,
though he didn't even know it at the time.

302
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,670
Before long Marty
was hooked,

303
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,200
physically dependant on heroin.

304
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:03,910
Nothing mattered but the ever-
present craving for the drugs.

305
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,220
He had given up interest
in everything else.

306
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:16,190
<i>I get no kick
from champagne</i>

307
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,530
But the early 1950's,
concerned about marijuana,

308
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:24,100
was overshadowed
by a new media scare:

309
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,540
Rising heroin addiction
among teenagers who,

310
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:28,800
were drifting into crime
to support their habit.

311
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:31,340
"MY SON IS A
HEROIN ADDICT!"

312
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,000
TEEN JUNKIES
ON CRIME SPREE

313
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:36,710
- I want some
money old Sam.

314
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,280
- You're... you're crazy.
- The money!

315
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:44,320
- I know you. They put you in jail.
- Just get the money!

316
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,260
- No, no!
- Please, no!

317
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:58,530
This heroin scare gave
the aging Anslinger,

318
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,330
a new way to attack
marijuana and respond,

319
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:03,770
to anyone who might
doubt it's terrible danger.

320
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,470
Smoking marijuana,
he declared,

321
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:09,040
was a direct stepping
stone to heroin addiction.

322
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,810
Remember: Most "H" Users
Started On Marijuana

323
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:18,550
<i>Satan is real
working in spirit,</i>

324
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:25,960
<i>You can see him, and hear him
in this world, every day</i>

325
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:32,670
<i>Satan is real
Working with power</i>

326
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:38,430
<i>He can tempt you
and lead you astray!</i>

327
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,910
- An individual who tries
the drug just for fun,
"TEA, HORSE AND CRIME" (circa 1951)

328
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:46,010
- or experiments with it,
acts exactly like a person,

329
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:49,680
- who loads the gun,
puts a bullet in,

330
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:54,250
- puts it up to his head,

331
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:58,720
- very carefully, hopes for the
best, and pulls the trigger.

332
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,070
Please stand by.

333
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,770
Teenage narcotic addiction,
is there an answer?

334
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,040
CONFIDENTIAL FILE

335
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:15,770
- May I have your name, please.
- Robert M. Connolyn,

336
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:19,880
- Command of the detective bureau
Culver City police department, Culver City, California.

337
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:23,920
- Is there any general personality
traits that would apply to addicts?

338
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:27,890
- Well yes. Most of these
addicts are very sick,

339
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:30,630
- and they are a menace
and have to be arrested.

340
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:33,990
- I get a lot of self satisfaction
arresting those people.

341
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:37,030
- And what about teenage addiction,
how does that come about usually?

342
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,130
- They start out by using marijuana.
- And the most marijuana users,

343
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:44,000
- finally go on to hard stuff?
- Yes.

344
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,570
- What kind of changes could be made
to improve the narcotics situation,

345
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:49,470
- based on present
knowledge, Bob?

346
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:54,140
- Well Paul, the addict
is a sick guy.

347
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:58,450
- And anything that can be make through
legislation to make the penalty far greater,

348
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:02,990
- I'm sure would be appreciated by every
cop, on every beat throughout the country.

349
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:06,360
- Your name, please.
- Harry J. Anslinger.
SENATE CRIME HEARINGS 1951

350
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:10,290
- And your position and occupation?
- Federal Commissioner of Narcotics.

351
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:12,400
Appearing at the
Kefauver crime hearings,

352
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:15,230
Anslinger backed Senator
Hale Boggs proposal,

353
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,910
to increase penalties
for all drug offences.

354
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:22,340
Tougher penalties were needed he said,
because behind every narcotics peddler,

355
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,550
there was a communist, preparing
to overthrow our government.

356
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:34,520
COMMUNIST CHINA'S ROLE IN THE
INTERNATIONAL DRUG TRAFFIC

357
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:37,930
- According to all the documents
that we have been examining,

358
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:44,230
- today, the major
source is red China,

359
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,600
- And do you see a marked
increase in the amount of drugs,

360
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,940
- circulating this country which you believe come
from red China since China went communist in 1949?

361
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:54,510
- Oh, very much so.

362
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:58,780
- I think, under the nationalists they had
the situation pretty well under control.

363
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:03,350
- There were about a thousand
executions a year,

364
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:05,990
- under the nationalist
Chinese government,

365
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:09,390
- I haven't heard of anyone being
wounded under this regime.

366
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,560
Even though there was absolutely no proof
of a communist plot to dope up America,

367
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,630
the country was in the
grip of cold war hysteria,

368
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:22,370
and no politician could afford
to look soft on communism.

369
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:27,870
Taking Anslingers advice, President
Truman signed the Boggs Act,

370
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:30,580
which dramatically increased
penalties for possession,

371
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,280
and ordered mandatory
minimum sentences.

372
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:36,019
BOGGS ACT

373
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:39,000
BOGGS ACT 1951
PASSED

374
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:46,120
- There's a considerable amount
of heroin coming out of China,
DANIEL SUBCOMMITTEE HEARINGS 1955

375
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:51,100
- You mean red China?
- Red China, yes.

376
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:55,070
On a roll now, Anslinger agitated
for even tougher laws,

377
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,970
and got President Eisenhower
to push them through congress.

378
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:06,289
Narcotic Control Act

379
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:09,740
Narcotic Control Act 1956
PASSED

380
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:24,430
The Narcotic Control Act put marijuana
in the same category as heroin,

381
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,960
and made it subject
to the same penalty.

382
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:29,340
A first conviction
for possession,

383
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:32,630
was punished with a mandatory
prison term of 2 to 10 years.

384
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:36,040
In addition, a number of states
added their own penalties.

385
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,150
In Missouri, a second conviction
for possession could get you life.

386
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,620
- This is Lieutenant McGee,
Atlanta police...

387
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:50,090
- This is Lieutenant McGee,
the Atlanta police department.

388
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:55,620
- We got the stuff, right away before
the man had a chance to distribute it,

389
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:58,070
- Do you think this stopped
the entire operation?

390
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,400
- Yes sir,
- I'm sure of it.

391
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,870
- Have you ever seen anything like it before?
- No sir, not in my career I haven't,

392
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,210
- haven't seen that
much marijuana.

393
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:10,180
Ok I'm gonna get a
different lens on here...

UNITED NATIONS
New York circa 1961

395
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:24,350
Setting his sights higher,
Anslinger went to the UN,

396
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,790
and used Americas influence to
persuade over 100 countries,

397
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:32,470
to consolidate their various drug agreements
into a single, inflexible convention,

398
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:35,040
outlawing marijuana
around the world.

399
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,870
This was the ultimate achievement
in Anslinger's relentless crusade,

400
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:41,050
to criminalize
marijuana use.

- in your dedicated efforts
to combat the illegal traffic,

406
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:20,480
- in narcotic drugs, you have fashioned an
effective organization to pursuit this objective.

407
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,980
- your noteworthy
achievements in this field,

408
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,880
- have earned for you the
respect of the world community.

- Signed, John F. Kennedy.

In leaving the
bureau he'd built up,

411
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:32,830
under five
different presidents,

412
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:34,460
Anslinger warned
his successors,

413
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:36,630
of an impending
drug revolution,

414
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:42,470
which he felt would be nothing less than an
assault on the foundations of western civilization.

The new declaration
of independence,

427

for the teenager
around the world.

428
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:51,770
Smoke a joint,
burn a little grass,

00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:57,980
Pot party, roach party, mainliners,
skin pop. Shoot some crystal.

430
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,890
The language of the narcotic
and marijuana user.

431
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:06,460
The language of a large and ever
increasing number of teenagers.

432
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:11,090
Starting in high school on
benzedrine and dexedrine pet pills,

433
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,360
it is not long before many
soon graduate to marijuana.

434
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:19,160
For some it quickens
sexual desire.

435
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:22,730
For some it is the release
of sexual inhibitions.

436
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:26,500
But whatever it is
teenagers are going for it,

437
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:31,380
and maybe the forerunner
of a new drug society,

438
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:34,620
out of some science fiction
writer's imagination.

439
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:38,160
Will drugs pave the
road to destruction,

<i>You know you
really turn me on,</i>

444
00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:00,780
On campuses across the country, a whole
new generation discovered drugs.

445
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,680
Rebellious, and willing
to experiment,

446
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:06,720
they found their light,
altering their consciousness.

00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,700
- Do you smoke pot?
- I have been smoking pot for about a year.

451
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:25,830
- Have you found it addictive?
- Oh no...

452
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:28,030
- I go for months and months
without smoking it,

453
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:31,280
- and then I'll smoke a
lot maybe in a week.

454
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:36,410
- Well the argument is made that pot leads
to the addiction to heroin or other narcotics.

455
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:39,220
- Have you found this to be so
among the people you know?

456
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,990
- No, not at all.

457
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:44,120
- The people who use the stronger
drugs, the opiates etcetera,

458
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:47,020
- are not the people
who smoke marijuana,

459
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:50,230
- the people who smoke marijuana
do not use the other drugs.

460
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,990
MARIJUANA IS WHOLESOME

461
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:56,200
Gradually, the perception that marijuana
was dangerous began to change.

462
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:00,230
Many students saw smoking grass as
a rejection of establishment values,

463
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:02,840
a way of declaring
their independence.

increase of the so-called 'hippies'.

483
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:31,060

- *** of the area.

485
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,790
- It is the belief of the people
who live within the area,

486
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:41,200
- that we, the middle class, have
done a very, very poor job,

To address it,

501
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:37,190
he developed a campaign he hoped would
be believable to the younger generation.

502
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,660
"If you smoke marijuana,
you will become an,

important time of your life:
SONNY BONO
entertainer

511
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:24,270
- Your teenage. That unrepeatable
time for you to grow up,

512
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:26,580
- and to prepare
for being an adult,

513
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,710
- that can handle problems and make
something meaningful out of life.

514
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,840
- Or, you have the choice to have
the courage, to see and deal,

515
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:40,530
- with the world for what it really is:
far, far from perfect,

00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,290
- but for you, and for
me, the only one...

PALO ALTO, CALIFORNIA circa 1967

518
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:52,790
Because so many were trying
marijuana without any ill effects,
PALO ALTO, CALIFORNIA circa 1967

519
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:54,700
the public demanded
to know more.

520
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:57,430
And for the first time,
the federal government,

521
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,200
approved scientific testing.

522
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:04,910
- The plain fact is that none of us
know very much about this drug,

523
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,210
- in any verifiable way.

524
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:13,180
- Well Bill it's been about two hours since
you got the drug, how do you feel?

525
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,690
- Fantastic!

526
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:20,820
- "Defiant?"
- Not at all.

527
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:24,790
- "Businesslike?"
- Not at all.

528
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:29,200
- "Friendly?"

529
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,750
- Extreme...

530
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,610
- This is so ridiculous.

531
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:39,610
- Would you be interested in taking
part in a study like this again,

532
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:43,450
- and having the same type of drug?
- Sure!

533
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,510
- It's been a very pleasant
experience for you?

534
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,490
- I'll do it anytime you want.

535
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:52,620
- Do you think it would be...
- Any time at all!

536
00:37:52,621 --> 00:37:54,630
- Just call me any time at
the day or the night...

537
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:58,600
- We found out that the
drug makes people happy,

538
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:03,570
- it makes them intoxicated
and finally makes them sleepy.

539
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:07,640
- Which is about what marijuana users
were telling us happened all the time.

540
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,450
Last call folks,
drink it up!

Good. That's fine.

Hell, let's drink!

545
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,720
- It says right
here that

546
00:38:25,721 --> 00:38:27,620
- alcohol does more harm
to your nervous system.

547
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:31,070
- Stop reading that underground trash and
pay more attention to your homework!

548
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,530
- All that drivel they talk...

or anti-war protestors,

553
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:54,780
conservative America
reacted with a fear,

554
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,360
and hatred that threatened
to pull the country apart.

555

A photographer before
he entered the army,

Vito is now a squad leader,
responsible of the lives of a dozen men.

562
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,390
- Well, it's called the shotgun...

563
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:43,370
- What we basically use
it for on the LC,

564
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:47,100
- I guess even out in the fields
so if you wanna know,

565
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,168
- is that we use it to shotgun.

566
00:39:50,169 --> 00:39:53,564
- From a bowl, you know you just
put the bowl in the chamber and all,

567
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,110
- Paul let me borrow that
that bowl from the...

568
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,720
- Here you go...
- Cool.

569
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:04,360
- This is probably all sins and we're
getting busted, but I don’t care.

570
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:07,350
- "Shotgun"...

571
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,940
What's happening here is also
happening to some extent,

572
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,440
at virtually every other American
installation in Vietnam.

573
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:25,580
Recent surveys estimate that well over 50%
of the soldiers in Vietnam use marijuana.

574
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,780
- You get really stoned.

575
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,420
- Then like, who cares
about the war?

576

NIXON CAMPAIGN COMMERCIAL (1968)

578
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:45,360
It is time for an honest look at the
problem of order in the United States.

579
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:50,000
So I pledge to you, we shall
have order in the United States.

580
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:57,179
ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA 1968

581
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,880
Manipulating the fears of what
he termed the silent majority,

582
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:02,680
Richard Nixon build his
campaign for the presidency,

583
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:05,490
around an emotionally
charged central issue:

584
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,430
Restoring law
and order,

585
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:09,150
and it worked.

586
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:13,020
As president, Nixon was
determined to be seen,

587
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:15,660
as the toughest
crime fighter ever.

588
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:18,100
But most crimes fell
under state jurisdiction,

589
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,240
so Nixon wasn't allowed
to get involved.

590
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:24,170
However there was one area where
the federal government did have power:

591
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,070
Drug crime.

592
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:29,340
Early in his first term,

593
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:33,340
Nixon launched Operation Intercept,
a military style exercise,

594
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:36,950
officially described as the
country's largest peace time,

595
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,890
search and
seizure operation.

596
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:43,450
In it, 2000 customs agents were
deployed along the Mexican border.

597
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:46,660
Their orders?
Stop the marijuana.

598
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:01,070
- This is the biggest mistake the
government of the United States has made,

599
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:04,110
- and the biggest offence they could
have done to the Mexican people.

600
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:15,550
- I think it's excellent,

601
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:18,750
- I think if it stops the marijuana
flow in Los Angeles,

602
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:23,190
- and the southern cities I think it's excellent,
if it doesn't, then I think our time is wasted.

603
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,560
Although more than five million
American and Mexican citizens,

604
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:30,810
passed through this dragnet,
practically no marijuana was intercepted.

605
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:34,840
After three weeks, Operation
Intercept was abandoned.

606
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:37,499
I have a couple of burritos, Over.

607
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,200
Have you brought the hot sauce? Over.

608
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:43,123
Yes, it is very tasty. Over.

609
00:42:43,152 --> 00:42:45,506
Okay. Let's have a picnic.

610
00:42:45,541 --> 00:42:47,660
I will see you at the picnic site.

611
00:42:57,570 --> 00:43:00,560
Now, even more determined
to appear tough on crime,

612
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:04,400
Nixon poured federal money into
equipping, training and educating,

613
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,870
local police forces
across America.

614
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:13,240
In the day-to-day conduct
of your police duties,

615
00:43:13,241 --> 00:43:18,550
no matter how or for what reason you're
called to investigate a situation in a residence,
POLICE TRAINING FILM (circa 1969)

616
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:22,990
use your eyes to detect
evidence of marijuana,

617
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:25,730
hashish, or
narcotic violation.

618
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:29,430
The evidence you're looking
for is here alright.

619
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:33,499
But it has to be located
before you can read it.

620
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,365
Use your eyes.

621
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:38,610
Ashtrays are logical places
to use your eyes,

622
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:41,110
for evidence of
marijuana violations.

623
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:45,710
There are some noticeable differences
between a marijuana or grass joint,

624
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:47,680
and the butt of an
ordinary cigarette,

625
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:51,680
fairly visible even at distance
to those you use their eyes.

626
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:53,880
This of course is
marijuana itself,

627
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:55,820
the best
evidence of all.

628
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:59,860
It has distinctive characteristics.
Learn them. Use your eyes.

629
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:02,800
It also has the
distinctive aroma,

630
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,570
so use your nose
as well as your eyes.

631
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:16,010
- Police officer,
open the door!

632
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,698
- Inside, inside,
come on...

633
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:28,990
- Look right here.

634
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:37,100
As arrests skyrocketed, the convictions
were no longer limited to minorities,

635
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:39,530
now most of the
people serving time,

636
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:42,330
were white, middle-
class American kids.

637
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:46,380
- Why do you
smoke marijuana?

638
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:49,440
- It's really
very simple.

639
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,310
- I smoke it because
I enjoy it.

640
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:54,820
- It doesn't worries you that
you're breaking the law?

641
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:56,610
- Sure it worries me!

642
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,480
- I mean it worries me because
I don't wanna get caught,

643
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:01,290
- I do not want to go to jail,

644
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:04,890
- for something that
I consider a pleasure,

645
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:09,260
- and harmless, to both
society and to myself.

646
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:12,560
- I'm not hurting anybody,
I'm not hurting myself.

647
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:14,499
- Why should I be
punished for it?

648
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,970
<i>And you may see me tonight
with an illegal smile,</i>

649
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:26,440
<i>It don't cost very much
but it'll last a long while,</i>

650
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:32,220
<i>Won't you please tell the man
I didn't kill anyone,</i>

651
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:36,420
<i>No I'm just tryin'
to have me some fun.</i>

652
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:42,560
When Don Crowe was
convicted of selling marijuana,

653
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:45,700
to undercover agent
there seemed reason for hope.

654
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:49,170
It was his first offence after all,
and the amount had been small,

655
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:52,310
less than one ounce.
But the jury saw it's duty.

656
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:55,010
Sentence?
50 years in prison.

657
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:59,070
For Crowe, 25 years old, newly
returned from Vietnam,

658
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:00,540
it was a bitter pill.

659
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:04,850
- I had the feeling that I was fighting
for my country, and for my fellow men.

660
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:13,260
- And it is kind of depressing to know that
I should come back and be given 50 years,

661
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:19,070
- for allegedly selling
some marijuana.

662
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:23,370
- This is a purple heart that he received
the first time he was wounded.

663
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:26,000
There is a mother's
pride as Ms. Crowl,

664
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:27,940
recounts Don's military record.

665
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:30,470
But it is
hard for her,

666
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:34,410
"He loved his country", she says.
"He was a good boy."

667
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:37,080
- Well we were naturally
so proud of him,

668
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:39,050
- when he was over there,

669
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:43,050
- and when he came back
and all this happened,

670
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:48,690
- of course I've just been heartbroken
and I think it is a little severe penalty.

671
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:52,099
POTpourri:
Many Views of Marijuana

672
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:56,700
- I don't think that a kid should have
their entire future career blinded,

673
00:46:57,110 --> 00:47:01,270
- by having an arrest record for being
caught in a room where marijuana was kept,

674
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:05,450
- or of smoking a joint of marijuana when
they're a kid in college or a young kid,

675
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:06,810
- and that's exactly what happens,

676
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:09,320
- Everyone here seems
to emphasize the kids,

677
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:12,050
- How can you communicate with them
when they got flowers on their ears,

678
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,720
- so they can't hear and hair
down to their hip pockets,

679
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:17,560
- A young person, other
minority group members,

680
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:20,690
- have a much greater chance of
being arrested and are arrested,

681
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,590
- and if this continues, we're going to
decimate the youthful population of America.

682
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:27,170
- That's exactly what's
going to happen.

683
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:29,210
- If anyone of us has
a kid who's arrested,

684
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:33,100
- it's going to be an arrest for narcotic
violation in his record for the rest of his life.

685
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:36,850
- He can't go in the peace corps, he
can't teach school, he can't be a cop,

686
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:38,380
- What's the difference if he committed
murder he'd have an arrest record?

687
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:40,790
- Fine if he committed murder
he's harmed someone!

688
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:44,150
- Can any law be effective, especially
a law dealing with marijuana,

689
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:48,420
- when there is so much controversy
from so many eminent-

690
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:54,160
- No law can be effective that actually, that
tries to regulate or legislate private morality.

691
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:57,160
- You can't make homosexual
laws effective, you cant make,

692
00:47:57,470 --> 00:48:00,060
- could you pass a law that
says it's a crime to masturbate?

693
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,700
- You couldn't enforce it!

694
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:07,480
- There's laws in the book that says "thou shalt not fornicate"
either, and you wouldn't go around arresting kids for fornicating,

695
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:12,180
- *** law I would.
- Don't you even know it's against the law? You're a hell of a cop!

696
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:16,390
- It is against the law a matter of fact... sex is illegal in most of America,
- Everything is illegal in America.

697
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,450
- *** illegal *** it's that simple.

698
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:22,490
- I think we've come to somewhat
of a conclusion here,

699
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:26,850
- in that the law is not very effective.
- No it's not, how can it be effective,

700
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:30,070
- when you have 10 thousand kids in one
city are being arrested in one year,

701
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,260
- the law is
not effective.

702
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,939
As middle class parents
began asking,
MARIHUANA: Time to Change The Law?

703
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:36,840
"Why is my kid in jail?"
MARIHUANA: Time to Change The Law?

704
00:48:36,841 --> 00:48:40,040
More and more Americans began to
feel that the problem was not marijuana,
MARIHUANA: Time to Change The Law?

705
00:48:40,110 --> 00:48:41,640
but marijuana laws.

706
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:44,900
<i>Feeling's getting stronger,</i>

707
00:48:44,901 --> 00:48:46,989
WOODSTOCK MUSIC FESTIVAL

708
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:50,750
<i>Music's getting
longer too,</i>

709
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:54,390
<i>Music is
flashin' me,</i>

710
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:56,750
<i>I want to,
I want to,</i>

711
00:48:57,130 --> 00:49:00,290
<i>I wanna take
you higher,</i>

712
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:04,260
Support for reform of marijuana law
seemed to come from everywhere.

713
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:07,770
Even federal officials agreed that
harsh penalties were not working.

714
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,839
SENATE HEARING ON MARIJUANA LEGISLATION 1969

715
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:12,000
- A conservative estimate
of persons in the United States,
SENATE HEARING ON MARIJUANA LEGISLATION 1969

716
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:15,070
- both juvenile and adults who have
used marijuana at least once,
DR. STANLEY YOLLES
Director, National Institute of Mental Health

717
00:49:15,071 --> 00:49:17,250
- is about 8 million and may
go as high as 12 million.
DR. STANLEY YOLLES
Director, National Institute of Mental Health

718
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:19,870
- Can you imagine what would
happen to the law enforcement,

719
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:21,750
- and correction system
of this country,

720
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:26,650
- if each of these 12 million people had been caught
by a policeman when smoking his first marijuana cigarette.

721
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:29,890
- The first place in which legal
reforms can be made,

722
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:33,950
- is in the removal of mandatory minimum
penalties in all cases of drug abuse.

723
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,169
Sensing the public's mood,

724
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:39,360
Congress passed the
Controlled Substances Act,

725
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:42,000
which eliminated mandatory
minimum sentences,

726
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:44,270
and reduced penalties
for possession.

727
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:59,343

742
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:03,120
- Is she dead?
- Not yet.

743
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:06,790
- This picture was taken at 10 pm.
- The girl lived until midnight.
"DRAGNET" (circa 1970)

744
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,990
- Any questions?

745
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:13,700
- But I maintain the evidence
against marijuana isn't in yet.

746
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:17,300
- Well sir, will you conceive that it
might be as harmful as alcohol.

747
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:20,879
- Alright, but it's no worse.
- No sir, I hope not.

748
00:51:20,914 --> 00:51:22,510
- Because according to
US government figures,

749
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:27,940
- between 5 and 6 million people in this country are physically
and mentally sick as a result of their use of alcohol.

750
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:31,840
- If marijuana possesses only
half the potential of alcohol,

751
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:33,670
- for violence, criminality,

752
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:37,420
- accidents and social degradation...
- Do we need pot?

753
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:46,530
Unwilling to let a bunch
of *** liberals to,

754
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:48,360
ruin his crime
fighting agenda,

755
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:51,170
Nixon enlisted TV-producers
and show business stars,

756
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:53,300
to send a strong
moral message,

757
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:57,130
"to every home, every school
and every church in America."

758
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,900
I've done a study
of drug abuse,

759
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:03,710
and I'm at the middle
of the whole thing,

760
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:07,520
where I can do the most good.
ELVIS PRESLEY
Special Assistant, Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs

761
00:52:07,521 --> 00:52:09,519
ELVIS PRESLEY
Special Assistant, Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs

762
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:12,390
Some people say that in a matter
of months "Acapulco Gold",
PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT (circa 1971)

763
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:15,490
will be available over the counter,
menthol and king size,

764
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:18,690
which is an indication of how little
people know about marijuana.

765
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:22,220
Today research scientists are
studying it's effects on the brain,

766
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:25,130
the nervous system, chromosomes,
various organs of the body,

767
00:52:25,570 --> 00:52:28,060
maybe it will turn out there
is no reason for it to be illegal.

768
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,110
But nobody can be sure
until all the facts are in.

769
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:34,510
And until they are,
it's a pretty bum risk.

770
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:38,710
Repelled by the idea
of softening any laws,

771
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:42,420
Nixon maintain that until more was
known about marijuana's dangers,

772
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:47,210
the law should not change. To this end
he made millions of dollars available,

773
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:49,620
to find those dangers.

774
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:24,899
POT SMOKERS BEWARE
Scientists report bizarre side effects:

775
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:28,420
Scientists report bizarre side effects:
MEN GROW BREASTS!

776
00:53:29,770 --> 00:53:32,530
- Many of us are concerned
that a large percentage,

777
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:37,560
- of our young people are breaking
the law by smoking marijuana.

778
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:44,310
- As you know here on White House
conference youth voted to legalize marijuana,

779
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:46,570
- I know you thought about
this problem and I wonder,

780
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:50,550
- if you could give us some of your thoughts on it.
- As you know,

781
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:54,550
- there is a commission that is supposed to make
recommendations to me about this subject,

782
00:53:54,930 --> 00:54:00,690
- The recommendation of the
Commission in it's first report,
RAYMOND P. SHAFER
Chairman, National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse

783
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:04,370
- is that we do not
feel that private use,

784
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,570
- or private possession
in one's own home,

785
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,630
- should have the stigma
of criminalization,

786
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:12,170
- that people who experiment,

787
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:16,100
- should not be criminalized for
that particular behavior.

788
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:19,120
The presidential commissions
report on marijuana found,

789
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:22,540
marijuana use in and of itself,
did not cause crime.

790
00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:25,850
Current laws against grass
led to selective prosecution,

791
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:28,720
and the police were suspected of
using these laws to arrest people,

792
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:30,750
with objectionable hairstyles,

793
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:32,720
skin color, or politics.

794
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:36,760
The enormous cost of trying to
enforce laws against marijuana,

795
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:40,370
overwhelmingly outweighed any
deterrent value of these laws.

796
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:44,770
The commission had conducted the
most comprehensive highly publicized,

797
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:47,410
study of marijuana,
ever done.

798
00:54:47,411 --> 00:54:50,349
THE OFFICIAL REPORT OF THE NATIONAL
COMMISSION OF MARIHUANA AND DRUG ABUSE

799
00:54:50,350 --> 00:54:54,370
Furious, Nixon tossed it in the waste
basket, without ever reading it.

800
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:04,730
- Mr. President?

801
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,630
- Okay...

802
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:11,930
- Whenever you're ready.

803
00:55:12,770 --> 00:55:17,300
- I shall continue to oppose
efforts to legalize marijuana.

804
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:20,240
Doing the exact opposite
of what was recommended,

805
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:22,670
Nixon declared an
all-out war on drugs.

806
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:26,580
His primary weapon, the DEA.
A new government agency,

807
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:30,290
that combined all of the government's
existing anti-drug agencies,

808
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:33,390
into a single, all-powerful
super-agency.

809
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:35,890
- You should keep
going forward until...

810
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:39,420
- until you're right there...
- Looks like you're right on top of it.

811
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:42,160
- Is that all there is?
- Yes.

812
00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:48,070
- The last week we pulled 13 pounds of it from about 5
different patches and we got another 4 or 5 now,

813
00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:52,030
- that are really small patches but we are
gonna go get in and pull them out today.

814
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:55,570
- What do you do with the, so you just come
in and destroy the patches, that the idea?

815
00:55:55,850 --> 00:55:57,640
- We destroy the patch and
then we'll take it and burn it.

816
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:00,500
- Apparently there is somebody coming
back here and cultivating this?

817
00:56:00,501 --> 00:56:03,780
- Definitely.
- These are all in nice little neat rows,

818
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:07,320
- it's kind of rotating crop,
some are smaller than others.

819
00:56:07,390 --> 00:56:09,260
- How good is Georgia pot?

820
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:11,560
- I've never smoked it,
so I don't know.

821
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:16,860
<i>One toke over the line
Sweet Jesus,</i>

822
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,760
<i>One toke over the line,</i>

823
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:23,070
<i>Sitting downtown
in a railway station,</i>

824
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:25,470
<i>One toke over the line!</i>

825
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:28,100
Employing more than 4000
analysts and agents,

826
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:31,140
the DEA had the authority
to request wiretaps,

827
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:36,080
in their private homes without knocking,
and gather intelligence on ordinary citizens.

828
00:56:42,330 --> 00:56:45,690
Brewer and Shipley still
"One Toke Over the Line",

829
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,260
and now Wadsworth Mansion,

830
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,900
smoking a little "Sweet Mary".

831
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,670
<i>Sweet Mary sent
a letter to me,</i>

832
00:56:53,070 --> 00:56:56,040
<i>She say to hurry home
I need you right away,</i>

833
00:56:57,070 --> 00:57:00,510
Meanwhile, in suburbia, smoking
pot had become the in-thing,

834
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,140
for middle-class adults.

835
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:05,070
Sort of like having a
martini at happy hour,

836
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:08,270
<i>Sweet Mary I'm
coming home,</i>

837
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:11,790
<i>Coming home to
you, yeah, yeah,</i>

838
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:16,090
<i>Sweet Mary I'm
coming home now,</i>

839
00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:19,750
<i>That's the
least I can do!</i>

840
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:23,360
Fry over a low to medium
fire for about 5 minutes,

841
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:25,530
stirring to
avoid burning.

842
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:29,060
Let it cool a few minutes,
then, grind it into a powder.

843
00:57:29,410 --> 00:57:31,370
Now you can do anything
you want with it:

844
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:34,270
will it be an ice cream,
butter, milkshakes, Jell-O,

845
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:37,110
or put it in honey an freeze
it into squares for later.

846
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:44,880
- Until recently the use of marijuana
was considered a youth phenomena,

847
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:48,590
- a thing of campus protest,
the counter-culture, longhair.

848
00:57:48,890 --> 00:57:50,620
- Well, not so in the 70's.

849
00:57:50,830 --> 00:57:54,130
- Meet some of the
"criminals" at large.

850
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:57,890
- I've spent a lot of time with
my daughter and her friends,

851
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:01,930
<i>and they all smoked marijuana,
and so I had to try it!
BETTY STRAND, GRANDMOTHER, AGE 56</i>

852
00:58:02,370 --> 00:58:06,740
- I first used pot back in
the latter part of 1968,

853
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:09,440
- and used it since then with
some degree of regularity.

854
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:15,150
- I had some pot earlier today
before I went down to court.

855
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:19,780
- I smoke at home, smoke
at parties, many places.

856
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:23,550
- To me it's a question of
the rights to life, liberty,

857
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:27,969
- and the pursuit of happiness.
- You know, who owns me?

858
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:30,560
Sign up here!
You over there, come here!

859
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:33,400
As smoking marijuana became
increasingly mainstream,

860
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:37,570
pro pot activists began organizing
support for decriminalization.

861
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:42,740
- Last year in this country, there were
226.000 marijuana related arrests,

862
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:47,480
- and although the police sometimes tell us that they're
only interested in the pusher, the seller, as they say,
KEITH STROUP
Founder, National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws

863
00:58:47,850 --> 00:58:51,290
- the fact is that only 7% of those
arrests were against the seller.

864
00:58:51,590 --> 00:58:54,490
- 93% of those arrests were
for possession and use.

865
00:58:54,730 --> 00:58:57,560
- Now what that means is that there
were about 200.000 young people,

866
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,820
- in this country last year, who were
given an unnecessary criminal record,

867
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,260
- and all that involved for
the rest of their life,

868
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:07,000
- simply because they smoked grass, something
which is a relatively harmless thing to do.

869
00:59:07,370 --> 00:59:10,569
- So we're not trying to encourage the use of
the drug, in fact we're trying to discourage it.

870
00:59:10,570 --> 00:59:15,140
- But we're trying to get the country to understand that
there are other means to discourage the use of drugs,

871
00:59:15,410 --> 00:59:17,310
- other than a criminal law,
and in this case,

872
00:59:17,710 --> 00:59:21,000
- the use of the criminal law causes
more harm than the drug itself.

873
00:59:22,990 --> 00:59:27,180
A political activist named John Sinclair
became a symbol for the movement.

874
00:59:27,590 --> 00:59:30,190
He received a jail
sentence of "10 for 2",

875
00:59:30,430 --> 00:59:33,230
10 years in prison for
possession of 2 joints.

876
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,760
- This song I wrote
for John Sinclair.

877
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:42,239
John Lennon and Yoko Ono in
"TEN FOR TWO" (1972)

878
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:45,210
<i>It ain't fair,
John Sinclair,</i>

879
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:48,070
<i>In the stair
for breathing air,</i>

880
00:59:48,410 --> 00:59:51,010
<i>Won't you care
for John Sinclair?</i>

881
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,940
<i>In the stair
for breathing air,</i>

882
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:56,950
<i>Let him be,
set him free,</i>

883
00:59:57,250 --> 00:59:59,880
<i>Let him be
like you and me.</i>

884
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:04,520
<i>They give him
10 for 2!</i>

885
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:08,060
<i>What else can

890
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:35,820
Consistent with the changing times,
the city of Ann Arbor, Michigan,

891
01:00:36,130 --> 01:00:39,690
passed an ordinance taking marijuana
possession out of the criminal code.

892
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,560
and making it a minor offence,
the equivalent of a parking ticket.

<i>Takin' it to the streets,

897
01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:02,640
A year later, after a groundbreaking
vote in it's legislature,

898
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:06,890
Oregon became the first state to
completely decriminalize marijuana.

899
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:10,930
- Here is a state that is not
afraid to plow new ground,

900
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:13,250
- in an area where
there's a lot of hysteria.

901
01:01:13,730 --> 01:01:16,569
- It's not gonna be very
widely understood,
TOM McCALL
Governor of Oregon

902
01:01:16,570 --> 01:01:21,100
- but I think as you look back
over the handling of drugs,
TOM McCALL
Governor of Oregon

903
01:01:21,370 --> 01:01:24,200
- if you can keep it in for a few years,
you'll see it was landmark legislation.

904
01:01:24,201 --> 01:01:28,127

Oregon Decriminalization Bill 1973
PASSED

907
01:01:36,450 --> 01:01:42,260
In 1974, with legal problems of his own,
Richard Nixon resigned from the presidency.

908
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:56,860
<i>Legalize it,
LEGALIZE MARIJUANA</i>

909
01:01:57,210 --> 01:02:00,770
<i>Don't criticize it,
- We smoke pot!</i>

910
01:02:00,771 --> 01:02:04,580
- We smoke pot!

911
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:10,000
<i>Legalize it,
Yeah, yeah,</i>

912
01:02:10,001 --> 01:02:12,459
<i>And I will
advertise it,</i>

913
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:16,020
- We don't want any penalty
for the private possession,

914
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:20,000
- and use, and cultivation
of marijuana.

915
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,269
<i>Legalize it...</i>

916
01:02:22,270 --> 01:02:25,720
A study in Oregon 4 years
after decriminalization,

917
01:02:25,870 --> 01:02:28,030
showed no increase
in marijuana use,

918
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:30,440
and a substantial savings
of tax dollars,

919
01:02:30,441 --> 01:02:33,000
formerly spent on
law enforcement.

920
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:36,370
By that time, 10 other states
had decriminalized marijuana.

921
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:48,550
Continuing Nixon's
war on drugs,

922

fill-in president
Gerald Ford ordered,

923
01:02:51,290 --> 01:02:53,960
US forces to spray
Mexican marijuana fields,

924
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:56,460
with the military
defoliant Paraquat.

925
01:02:58,270 --> 01:03:03,430
But in the upcoming presidential election, he found
himself running against an unexpected opponent.

926
01:03:03,510 --> 01:03:05,270
- Appreciate your vote.

Tonight on Headline NEWS:

933
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:31,900
President Carter proposes major
changes to federal drug laws.

934
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,439
- I support a change in law, and
in federal criminal penalties,

935
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:38,370
- for possession of up to
one ounce of marijuana,

936
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:41,970
- leaving the states
free to adopt,

937
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:43,740
- whatever laws they
wish concerning marijuana.

Doing part to advocacy by the
decriminalization movement,

939
01:03:49,590 --> 01:03:52,490
the government was finally

- What?
- Yeah my dog ate my stash man,

- So I had to farm with a little baggy

In the permissive 70's, marijuana
seemed to be everywhere,

966
01:05:57,010 --> 01:06:00,380
through movies and television, it
had entered the popular culture.

967
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:05,280
- The FBI claims that a huge shipment of
grass which they are calling "Killer Dope",

968
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:07,820
- has been smuggled into New York City.
"SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE" (circa 1978)

969
01:06:07,990 --> 01:06:12,360
- The bureau urges, users not to smoke
the weed, which is greenish-brown in color,

970
01:06:12,630 --> 01:06:15,860
- not particularly seedy, and
contains mostly cannabis buds.

971
01:06:16,230 --> 01:06:20,140
- Warning symptoms are a mild euphoria
a slight rise in the pulse rate,

972
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:24,460
- some hallucination and death by
laughter within 15 minutes of ingestion.

973
01:06:27,610 --> 01:06:32,140
- In an effort to aid the FBI in it's
investigation, Weekend Update,

974
01:06:32,420 --> 01:06:37,720
- is undertaking it's own analysis of marijuana sent to
us anonymously by any viewers who may be worried.

975
01:06:37,950 --> 01:06:42,020
- Simply place a small sample of the
suspected cannabis in an envelope,

976
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:44,730
- and send it immediately to:

Worried about teenage

01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:58,010
a number of concerned parents
organized pressure groups,

01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:00,240
to fight the new
drug culture.

982
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:04,440
- This is a dashboard pipe that fits
under the dashboard of your car,

SUSAN RUSCHE
Co-Founder, National Families in Action

985
01:07:10,490 --> 01:07:13,320
- This is designed to put some
pot in and then you smoke,

986
01:07:13,321 --> 01:07:15,620
- the pot out of here.

987
01:07:16,530 --> 01:07:19,790
- You can toss a smoke
to a friend if you want to.

988
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:22,660
- There are things like
"bongs", that's B-O-N-G.

989
01:07:22,930 --> 01:07:24,870
- You put the pot
here, light it,

990
01:07:24,970 --> 01:07:27,490
- and smoke travels
down here, collects,

991
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:31,000
- and then you get a concentrated
volume of smoke... by sucking in like this.

992
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:34,440
- And I think the label is instructed:
Bong, the only thing wasted is you".

993
01:07:34,740 --> 01:07:39,180
- This too is a bong, it's called a power-hitter,
and it works by sticking a joint here,

994
01:07:40,050 --> 01:07:43,510
- and then blasting it,
into your lungs, like this.

995
01:07:43,850 --> 01:07:46,720
- It comes as a Star
Wars space gun also.

- Closed, officially closed as of now.

1004
01:08:10,850 --> 01:08:14,110
- what actually were headshops
and drug-related paraphernalia.

1005
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:19,290
- Mangers and owners from headshops around the
area testified that the law is now so ambiguous,

1006
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:24,130
- that possibly as much as 80% of their
inventory could now be considered illegal.

1007
01:08:24,430 --> 01:08:28,690
- One owner admitted he may be

- Okay.

- Most of the afternoon was
spent trying to decide,

1010

- what actually were headshops
and drug-related paraphernalia, and...

1011
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:39,539
- Okay.

1012
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:41,530
- Most of the afternoon was
spent trying to...

1013

- Most of the afternoon was
spent trying to decide,

1015
01:08:48,150 --> 01:08:50,780
- what were headshops and
drug-related paraphernalia.

1016
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:53,250
- Owners and managers of headshops around...

THE QUAALUDE AFFAIR

1018
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:01,960
It the midst of this backlash,
Dr. Peter Bourne,

1019
01:09:02,270 --> 01:09:04,530
Carter's chief drug policy advisor,

1020
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:07,530
was caught up in a scandal
involving alleged cocaine use.

1021
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:10,610
As the press had a field day, the
president could no longer afford,

1022
01:09:10,910 --> 01:09:12,840
to appear soft on drugs.

1023
01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:17,910
His proposal to decriminalize
marijuana would die in congress.

1024
01:09:17,911 --> 01:09:23,000
<i>She don’t lie, she don’t lie
she don’t lie, cocaine...</i>

1025
01:09:23,001 --> 01:09:26,687
WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO DECRIMINALIZATION?

1026
01:09:27,290 --> 01:09:31,280
- I'm sick and tired of hearing
about all of the radicals,

1027
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:34,900
- and the perverts,
and the liberals,

1028
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:38,600
- and the lefties, and the communists
coming out of the closet,

1029
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:42,200
- it's time for God's people to
come out of the closet,

1030
01:09:42,510 --> 01:09:47,239
- out of the churches and
change America! We must do it!

1031
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:49,800
Driven by a sense of
righteous indignation,

1032
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:53,450
the religious right mobilized
into a potent political force,

1033
01:09:54,180 --> 01:09:56,410
after a brief period of tolerance,

1034
01:09:56,690 --> 01:09:59,880
America was poised for a
major swing the other way.

- pot, grass, whatever
you wanna call it,

1038
01:10:10,730 --> 01:10:14,600
- is probably the most dangerous
drug in the United States,

1039
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:18,070
- and we haven't begun to
find out all of the ill effects,

1040
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:22,100
- but they are permanent ill effects,
the loss of memory for example.

1041
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:26,110
This is your brain on drugs,

1042
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:28,050
Any questions?

1043
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:30,680
- Just say "no".
- Just say "no".

1044
01:10:31,150 --> 01:10:32,420
- Just say "no"!

1045
01:10:32,421 --> 01:10:34,780
In her crusade to address the America,
Mrs. Reagan let school children...

...are police officers in

suspected of drug possession.

1050
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:55,140
Signing a threat to
national security,

1051
01:10:55,141 --> 01:10:58,214
the president today, signed legislation,
ANTI-DRUG ABUSE ACT 1968

allowing law-enforcement agencies
to seize property from society...
ANTI-DRUG ABUSE ACT 1988

1053
01:11:01,650 --> 01:11:05,020
Under president George Bush's new zero
tolerance policy, marijuana smokers...

1054
01:11:05,490 --> 01:11:08,220
- Using illegal drugs
is against the law.

1055
01:11:08,221 --> 01:11:10,389
<i>They'll stone ya when you're
tryin' to keep your seat.</i>

1056
01:11:10,390 --> 01:11:13,920
- And when you're caught,
you will be punished.

1057
01:11:13,921 --> 01:11:15,869
<i>They'll stone ya when
you're walkin' on the floor.</i>

1058

01:11:20,470 --> 01:11:22,892
- We'll make room.

1061
01:11:22,893 --> 01:11:24,769
- The rules have changed.

1062
01:11:24,770 --> 01:11:27,680
In his speech to the coastguard
today, George Bush said,

1063
01:11:27,681 --> 01:11:30,500
that drug trafficking should
be grounds for death penalties.

1064
01:11:30,501 --> 01:11:31,332
<i>Everybody must get stoned!</i>

1065
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:38,000
- I'm proposing a quarter
of a billion dollar...

1066
01:11:38,001 --> 01:11:40,399
- billion dollar..
- 2.2 billion...

1067
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:44,350
- 8 billion dollars.
- The largest increase in history.

1068
01:11:44,351 --> 01:11:46,763
<i>But I would not
feel so all alone,</i>

1069
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:52,625
<i>Everybody must get stoned...</i>

01:12:40,271 --> 01:12:43,310
- We smoke pot!
Pot MAKES ME HAPPY

1075
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:45,520
Since President Clinton took office,
NEW YORK CITY 1999

1076
01:12:45,521 --> 01:12:49,090
over 3 million people have been
arrested for possession of marijuana,
NEW YORK CITY 1999

1077
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:52,090
more than under any
previous administration.

1078
01:12:52,460 --> 01:12:55,950
The United States government
continues to wage a war on grass that,

1079
01:12:56,230 --> 01:13:03,061
time, and time again, has proven
itself misguided, and completely ineffective.

1080
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:08,210
That being so, the
orderly thing to do,

1081
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:11,510
under our form
of government,

1082
01:13:11,950 --> 01:13:16,010
is to abolish a law which
cannot be enforced,

1083
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:20,880
a law which the people of the
country do not want enforced!
