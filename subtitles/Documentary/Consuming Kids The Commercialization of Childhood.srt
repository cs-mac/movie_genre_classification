1
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,797
Good morning, Quark.

2
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,553
I couldn't believe it. Lisa told
Janet that Paul asked Barbara...

3
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,473
to ask me if I had
a date to the dance.

4
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,869
No, they broke up for
religious differences.

5
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,520
She thought she was God
and he disagreed.

6
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,874
Yeah, this afternoon around 5:00.

7
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,520
I'm meeting him at the mall.
I don't know.

8
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,272
Maybe. Yeah.

9
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,914
Oh, I can't. I've got to hang around
a while and keep an eye on Nick.

10
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,958
He likes to take things apart.

11
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,830
Well, that's why I watch it at your
house. Things'll cool off after today.

12
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,593
Dad has his big
show-and-tell at the lab.

13
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,596
Zap!

14
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,229
- It works! I-It really works!
- Nick, get real.

15
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,356
The subject has disappeared.

16
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,954
No, no, it's not that.

17
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,834
No. Mom and Dad had
an argument last night...

18
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,751
and Mom spent the night
at Grandma's.

19
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,717
I think she just needed a rest.

20
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,756
Right, her and me both.

21
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,230
Yeah, okay. Okay. Bye.

22
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,277
Amy, when's Mom coming home?

23
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,670
She's working, Nick.
She'll be home this afternoon.

24
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,354
If only Dad could get
that machine to work.

25
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,591
Breakfast.

26
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,110
I need a couple minutes here.

27
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:49,475
"I'll be down in five minutes."

28
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,551
Typing with his gloves on again.

29
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,599
Oh, no, not again!

30
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,229
Who does he think he is,
Mister Wizard?

31
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,476
Szalinski, give it a rest!
It's Saturday!

32
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,678
It's construction, honey. You of
all people should understand that.

33
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,714
Yeah, but I want some sleep.
We've got a four-hour drive ahead of us.

34
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,950
And I think he should have
consideration for other people.

35
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,793
Mm, give the guy a break.

36
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,998
I'll give him a break.
I'll break his arm!

37
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,672
Honey!

38
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,317
Szalinski!

39
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,356
But, honey, you are
much bigger than he is.

40
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,159
Szalinski!

41
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,595
- Honey, can't...
- Hold it, Dad.

42
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,511
- Don't move.
- Ron, what are you doing?

43
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,160
- Defending the backyard, Dad.
- That's my fishing rod!

44
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,395
Stop! Dad!

45
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,798
- Am I bleeding?
- Honey, it's rubber.

46
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,838
- Dad, I told you not to move.
- What's on this thing?

47
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,913
- Super Glue.
- Super Glue?
- Gotta mark those trespassers, Dad.

48
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,356
- I'm not a trespasser. I'm your father!
- Let me wash it off quick, hon.

49
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,556
- Ah, it's taking the skin off.
- I'll talk to you later.

50
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,074
- What's with this kid?
- He's 12.

51
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,549
- Attila the Hun was
12 once, too, you know.
- Oh, come on.

52
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,757
He's sounding.

53
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,920
Weird family.

54
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,552
Dad?

55
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,552
Look, I finished mine.
Looks just like yours, huh?

56
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,593
- That's great, Nick.
- You know, Dad, I was calculating.

57
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,355
- If you took all the
molecules in this house...
- Listen, Nick, I gotta get
this working before I leave.

58
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,715
Why don't you go help your sister?

59
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,955
Stay back, boy.
This thing works...

60
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,838
this'll put us up there with
the invention of electricity...

61
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,673
first man in space.

62
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,671
First dog in space.

63
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,511
Come on! Shrink!

64
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,068
Shrink!

65
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,635
Please, please, shrink.

66
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,392
Please, shrink.

67
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,518
On the other hand, we've come up with an
interesting way of making applesauce.

68
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,199
- You got it, honey.
- Sure?
- Positive.

69
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,353
You're wiping away brain cells,
and there aren't many to spare.

70
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,230
- Everybody in my family's a comedian.
- Everybody except you.

71
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,197
Darn right.

72
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,992
Well, look who's decided to
join the land of the living.

73
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,674
And is Russell ready
for his big fishing trip?

74
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,433
- Not really, Dad.
- Not really?

75
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,353
There's a big fish out there
with your name on it.

76
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,670
Fishing's your thing,
Dad, not mine.

77
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,108
What's the matter with him?
What do you mean, shush?

78
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,318
There... I see nothing wrong
with wanting to take my son fishing.

79
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,710
Russell, I shouldn't be telling
you this, but he was cut from
the football team yesterday.

80
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,997
- What?
- Honey, please. What he doesn't
need right now is to hear from you.

81
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,799
- He needs something.
When I was his age, I was capt...
- Captain of the team.

82
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,314
And if my father'd wanted me to go on
a fishing trip, I would've been gra...

83
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,073
You'd been grateful.
Russ, he is too small for football.

84
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,754
He is not too small for football!

85
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,513
Honey, when you say things like that,
you make him feel about this big.

86
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,831
If he wants to feel big,
he should act big.

87
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,875
Elbows up.

88
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,278
- What's the matter with you?
- I'm on a special diet.

89
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,316
- No toxic waste.
- Fine.

90
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,279
Here, Quark.

91
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,879
Eat it, Dad,
before it gets cold.

92
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,479
Mm, did you get
the machine to work?

93
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,637
Yeah. A few more bugs
to get out, but...

94
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,713
- What about the conference?
<i>- Meow.</i>

95
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,870
Jeez, the conference.
I gotta get going.

96
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,509
Dad! Dad, wait. Dad!

97
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,750
If Mom calls, tell her
I'll be home by lunchtime.

98
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,268
Dad, don't forget my dress from
the cleaners, Nick's allergy pills...

99
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,271
It's all in my head.
Don't worry.

100
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,557
Wish me luck. I need luck
getting out of this door.

101
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,792
- House of insanity.
- Hi, honey.

102
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,757
<i>Hi, Mom. Nick, go get Dad.</i>

103
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,274
He's just leaving
for the conference.

104
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,749
Dad, it's Mom.

105
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,836
- Where?
- On the phone.

106
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,911
- Oh.
- How did everything go this morning?

107
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,839
- Boy, did we miss you.
- I missed you, too, honey.

108
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,718
- Did Paul Tate ask you to the dance?
- I think he's going to.

109
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,756
I'm gonna meet him at
the mall later today.

110
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,831
- Here's Dad.
- Thanks.

111
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,672
- Hiya.
<i>- Hi.</i>
- Nick!

112
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,753
- I called to wish you luck
at the conference.
- Look, Diane, if things go well...

113
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,439
this morning, everything'll change
around here, I promise you.

114
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,159
<i>Okay. I have</i>
<i>a house to show...</i>

115
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,435
and then I'll be home this
afternoon and we'll talk.

116
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:34,354
<i>- Good luck today.</i>
- Thanks. Bye, honey.

117
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,353
- What time is Mom coming home?
- Later. Listen, we gotta make
this place spick-and-span, okay?

118
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,079
Nick, I want you to
mow the lawn. Amy...

119
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,156
good luck.

120
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,392
I'm helping my Dad with this
real important new invention.

121
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,153
So, mm...

122
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,118
I'll... I'll let you
mow half my yard.

123
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,633
No, thanks.

124
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,591
Wow! With that?

125
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,511
Yeah...

126
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,238
and...

127
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,111
this.

128
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,151
Oh, it's a remote control!

129
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,717
Tell you what. You thrown in
a box of cookies...

130
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,234
I'll let you cut the whole thing.

131
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,033
Uh, but I have to go
and meet Newt right now.

132
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,275
Uh, could I do it later?

133
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,238
- I don't think so, because, you know,
my Dad's gonna come home and...
- Aw, come on.

134
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,231
- Okay. But don't be too late.
- Okay, thanks.

135
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,794
- No problem.
- See you later!

136
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,473
Nothin' like a hard day's work.

137
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,311
French fries.

138
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,594
Tater Sticks.

139
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,240
Meat loaf.

140
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,470
Veal "parmedjian."

141
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,351
Hey, Dad, wanna go
play some baseball?

142
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,193
Hmm, baseball.

143
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,199
No. I gotta load the camper, Ron.
I'm busy.

144
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,033
Hey, Russ, pitch for me.

145
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,755
Hey, Szalinski, ever do anything normal,
like play baseball?

146
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,195
Nope.

147
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,312
- Baseball's for mortals.
- Maybe you could be the base.

148
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,872
- Maybe you could be the mound.
- Ronald!

149
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,951
Lug your stuff.

150
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,871
Later, worm.

151
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,113
Russell, gimme a hand here.

152
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,919
Russell! Gimme a hand here.

153
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,393
Dad, it's early.

154
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,358
The early worm catches
the fish, Russell.

155
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,232
Remember that.

156
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,795
The Forresters are coming by after
lunch, so come on! Quick march!

157
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,475
<i>Something here between us</i>
<i>is something that I can't resist</i>

158
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:55,229
<i>A physical attraction</i>
<i>Feel it every time we kiss</i>

159
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,231
Weird family.

160
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,916
<i>Oh, you got me so excited</i>
<i>Still it's not enough</i>

161
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,630
<i>I'm gonna try to fight it</i>
<i>till I know if this is love</i>

162
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,676
<i>Turn it up</i>

163
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,877
- Yeah!
<i>- Turn it up, ooh hoo</i>

164
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,634
<i>I love to hear</i>

165
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,314
Russell...

166
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,958
I know it seems strange
when you look at me today...

167
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,830
but when I was your age,
I was not much bigger than you.

168
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,469
- I know, Dad. You've told me
about a million times.
- All right. Just hear me out.

169
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,711
The point is,
Coach put me on these babies.

170
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,998
Know what happened? I put on 20 pounds
of pure, unadulterated...

171
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,277
blitz-the-quarterback
and rip-his-head-off muscle, Russell.

172
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:47,275
Now, I'll make you a little bet.
If you work out for three months...

173
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,750
you will be throwing farther,
you will be running faster...

174
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,673
and you will be hitting harder
than anybody else on that team.

175
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,877
Go on. Try it. Go ahead.

176
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,956
Um, Dad, you... you know that
weights aren't my thing.

177
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,710
Fishing isn't your thing.

178
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,951
Weights aren't your thing.
Just what is your thing?

179
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:37,110
I don't know, but I'll
keep you posted, okay?

180
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,829
Fine. Until you do,
you're trying these.

181
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,595
And you're coming fishing
with the family. Is that clear?

182
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,148
I can't hear you!

183
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,800
Yes, sir.

184
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,155
Better.

185
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,516
Now, uh, lift with your legs,
not with your back.

186
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,711
What am I doing wrong, Spike?

187
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,034
Russell, you're not smoking
a cigarette, are you?

188
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,236
No, dear.
You know I've given that up.

189
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,029
- Your stuff all loaded?
- Ready to fire.

190
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,511
- Got the best spot on the lake.
You looking forward to it?
- Tubular!

191
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,149
He's only 12, and he's already
thinking about construction.

192
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,552
- Why can't Russell be more like that?
- Oh, honey, just give him a chance.

193
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,515
Ron Thompson at the plate. Bottom of
the ninth. It's a clutch situation.

194
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:08,395
Here's the pitch.
Oh, he's swinging like a rusty gate.

195
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,040
He pumps once, pumps twice. Ohh!

196
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,588
He's never been good
on the high outside pitch.

197
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,672
Here it comes. Fastball.
His bread and butter.

198
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,398
Grand...

199
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,596
slam.

200
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,877
Hey, hey, I didn't do it.

201
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,111
- Come on, you dope.
- Hey, nobody has to know.
Nobody saw it but you.

202
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,351
Let's negotiate this.
I'm your brother, Russ.

203
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,472
You're not supposed to fink
on your own brother!

204
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,199
Turn me in, and I'll tell all that
you spend your allowance on... Uuh!

205
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,157
Come on, Russ!

206
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,113
Look, either you tell them
or I tell them, okay?

207
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,477
Okay. You tell 'em.

208
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,835
- Aren't you in the wrong yard?
- Listen, nerd face...
- Tell them.

209
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:13,152
- What's going on?
- Hi. Um...

210
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,118
I-I'm Russ Thompson
from next door, uh...

211
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,838
Um...

212
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,071
Uh, my brother has something to
tell you, or else I could tell her.

213
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,232
Okay! See, I was playing
with my ball, right?

214
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,550
Well... Well, actually,
it's not my ball exactly.

215
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,358
- It's Charlie Sudzen's.
- Just tell her what you did.

216
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,716
It never would've happened
if their house wasn't so close!

217
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,234
- He hit a baseball
through your attic window.
- He what?

218
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,232
It shouldn't have been closed
in the first place. It's a nice day!

219
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,915
- We'll get it fixed, okay? We'll take
it out of his allowance, all right?
- My allowance? Dream on.

220
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,560
Okay, we'll just have
Dad pay for it, huh?

221
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,710
We'll take it out of my allowance.
Gimme my ball back.

222
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,519
Until you pay,
no man shall pass.

223
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,798
- You got nothin' to say
about it, space boy!
- Cool it!

224
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,758
Nick, take him upstairs and get him
his ball. And clean up the mess.

225
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,991
- What?
- Do it, Nick. I don't
have time to mess around.

226
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,999
Come on. This is what's wrong with
the American system of justice.

227
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,595
So, y... You like to dance, huh?

228
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,550
- How do you know?
- Well...

229
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,477
- You could see me?
- No.

230
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:20,399
Uh, no, I... Yeah, I could.
But I wasn't watching you. I...

231
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,838
Awesome.

232
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,480
So your Dad's still in contact
with his home planet.

233
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,870
And given that my machine can
substantially reduce...

234
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:47,353
the size of bulky payloads
and fuel supplies...

235
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,073
the savings to the space programme
would be staggering.

236
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,355
Mr. Szalinski, are you
trying to tell me that...

237
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,874
suddenly size is
no longer relative?

238
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,990
Well, that's right, Professor
Frederickson, that all matter is...

239
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,275
made up of not only density,
but of empty space.

240
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,669
And if we can proportionally reduce
the amount of empty space...

241
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,513
in any given object, we can
thereby shrink the object.

242
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,558
Uh-huh. Where's your proof?

243
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,076
When Einstein came up with
the atomic bomb, did they ask
him to prove that it worked?

244
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,232
You, Mr. Szalinski,
are hardly Einstein.

245
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,591
- I picked a name.
- You have, however,
managed to shrink one thing...

246
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,875
the size of this audience.

247
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,708
Gentlemen, ladies, I don't know
about you, but I'm going to lunch.

248
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,638
Wayne. Wayne.

249
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,518
- Oh, uh, hi, Dr. Maynard.
- Don't take it too hard, Wayne.

250
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,030
It will take time to convince
people without proof.

251
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,116
I appreciate it.
Thanks a lot.

252
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,399
By the way, you were right
about the electric flea collar.

253
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,311
The extension cord was a bad idea.

254
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:56,229
What could be taking them so long?
I am not missing the mall today.

255
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,231
Nick!

256
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,870
- Nick...
- Ron?
- if you guys are hiding up here...

257
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,030
it's not funny.

258
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,236
Nick, you know what Dad said.

259
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,238
You're not supposed
to be playing up here.

260
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,389
Where are we?

261
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,952
God, what happened?

262
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,632
- Amy!
- Russ!

263
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,030
Amy!

264
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,031
- Nicky.
- Ron?

265
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,708
- Nick, what happened?
- We're all the size of boogers!

266
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,955
Be quiet, Quark!

267
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,559
- Nick, what did you do?
- Me? It was his ball!

268
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,716
- Shut up, wimp!
- We have to get Dad.

269
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,716
He'll know what to do.

270
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,871
Nick, if that's Paul Tate,
I'm gonna kill you.

271
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,869
Can somebody get that?

272
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,554
- What's that?
- It's Dad's thinking couch.

273
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,510
Amy? Nick?

274
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,437
Hello?

275
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,232
It's not for you.

276
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,634
What is it, Quark?

277
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,870
Nick!

278
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,791
- Listen.
- Are you guys home?

279
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,030
Sounds like Dad.
He'll fix us.

280
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,588
Mr. Szalinski! Up here!

281
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,148
- Up here, Dad!
- Quick, over there by the door.

282
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,754
- Okay? Get that side.
- Anybody up there?

283
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,360
- Nick!
- Get off and give us a hand!

284
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,876
Nick? Amy?

285
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,349
Hey, Amy, your date's here.

286
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,716
- Oh, gross.
- Watch out for the crack!

287
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,514
Hurry up. He's coming!

288
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,713
- Right here!
- Szalinski!
- Dad! Dad!
- Mr. Szalinski!

289
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,633
- Down here!
- Help!

290
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,192
- Help!
- Help!
- Help!

291
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,277
Where's my couch?

292
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,157
What is he, deaf?

293
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,516
Don't you get it?
We're too small. He can't hear us.

294
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,713
Dad!

295
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,191
I don't believe this.

296
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,591
What a day.

297
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,557
Ow!

298
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,879
This is all your fault!

299
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,791
- Five years...
- No, Dad, it works!

300
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,030
- Szalinski, don't do it!
- No! Mr. Szalinski!
- Dad!

301
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,997
You don't even work!

302
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,956
Don't!

303
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,877
- Run!
- Run.

304
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,753
Run, Nicky! Keep up!

305
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,995
Dad!

306
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,509
Stay there!
There's glass everywhere here now.

307
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,715
- No!
- Dad! Run, Nicky!

308
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,593
No! Back the other way!

309
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,118
Go!

310
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,070
- Help!
- Help!

311
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,348
No!

312
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,718
Help! Somebody!

313
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,310
Not now, Quark.

314
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,276
Szalinski, do they pick up your trash
the same day they get ours?

315
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,918
Ow! Nick?

316
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,037
- I'm over here.
- Then whose arm is this?

317
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,759
I don't know, but I'm not waitin'
around to find out. Move over.

318
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,559
- Ow! Watch it!
- Look out.

319
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,356
Oh, my God.

320
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,316
Reminds me of the backyard.

321
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,799
Something tells me we're
not going fishing this weekend.

322
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,350
- That should make you happy.
- Blow it out your shorts, Ron.

323
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,476
Dad can fix us, right, Nick?

324
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,233
I... I think so.

325
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,437
- Oh, great.
- We just have to get back to the house.

326
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:11,071
I'm never goin' back to your house!
I'm goin' home.

327
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,799
Come on, Russ.

328
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,840
- Russ?
- Tell me the truth.

329
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:22,515
- Could your Dad help us?
- Russ! We're supposed to go fishing!

330
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,670
Yeah, right!
How are you going, as bait?

331
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,595
What a witch!

332
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,193
Russ, you comin' down, or what?

333
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,316
Well, we can't stay here.

334
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,589
Well, I think we should
stick together.

335
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,716
Well, come on.

336
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,671
Nicky!

337
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,757
I don't think we're
in Kansas any more, Toto.

338
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:26,276
I don't think we're in
the food chain any more, Dorothy.

339
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,917
Come on, Ron.
We're gonna go with them.

340
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,357
What? You let a girl
tell you what to do?

341
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,829
Look, Ron, down here,
you're gonna listen to me.

342
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:44,799
From now on, you're gonna
do what I say! Run!

343
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,832
Great Sir Russell Thompson,
stalking the rogue butterfly.

344
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,593
Knock it off, Ron.

345
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,035
We're now a quarter
of an inch tall...

346
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,351
and 64 feet from the house.

347
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:16,115
That's the equivalent
of 3.2 miles.

348
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,998
That's a long way,
even for a man of science.

349
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:23,790
Nick, I've got six hours to get home,
get big and get to the mall.

350
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,757
Now get moving!

351
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,799
That butterfly had
a wingspan of 42 feet!

352
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,995
Nick!

353
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,237
Hi.

354
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,759
Hi.

355
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,109
- Guess what I s...
- Look, Diane...

356
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,156
- I sold a house.
- Really? That's great!

357
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,312
Yeah, you know that big estate?
The Boorsteins bought it.

358
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,834
I only had to show it
to them 12 times.

359
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,754
- How'd your conference go?
- Well, I got a lot of laughs.

360
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,910
- Oh, Wayne.
- I failed, Diane.

361
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:12,158
I-I... I'm just gonna get my old job
back, if I can get my old job back.

362
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,515
But from now on,
things are gonna be different.

363
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,391
Different.

364
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,357
Right.

365
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,435
- Where are the kids?
- I haven't seen them
since I left this morning.

366
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,718
- Well, did you tell
them I was coming home?
- Yeah, that's why
they cleaned things up.

367
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,872
I see. Oh, they're probably
just at the mall.

368
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,148
Do you wanna hear somethin' strange?
My thinking couch is missing.

369
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,509
- The one from the attic?
- Yeah.

370
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:53,277
Hey, Ron, this is a lot better than
those nature hikes Dad drags us...

371
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,430
Nick, don't you ever
pick up your toys?

372
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:02,115
- What a wimp!
- Been looking for that guy.

373
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:09,070
It's already 1:00.
So much for the mall.

374
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:14,553
What if time shrunk too?
I mean, what if it's hours to us,
but it's years to the rest of the world?

375
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,279
Hey, that would be cool.
All my teachers would be retired.

376
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,834
Impossible. Time doesn't exist,
except as a...

377
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,037
- Oh, no.
- What's a river doing in your yard?

378
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,398
It's not a river, dope.
It could be a stream of dog pee,
and it'd look like a river to us.

379
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,119
Let's swim it.

380
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:38,196
- Have a ball, baby.
- I'm not swimming in that.

381
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,195
Hey! Hey, if we could
get some rope...

382
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,316
we could make a log bridge!

383
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,151
If... If we... If we had some logs.

384
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,198
- Quark!
- Your dog?

385
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,669
- Yeah.
- Quark can't hear us.

386
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,676
Yeah, he can!
Dogs have great ears.

387
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,877
If we can get on him, he'll take us
all the way back to the house.

388
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,791
Whistle.

389
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,076
- What's wrong?
- He can't whistle.

390
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,837
Let's get higher up.

391
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:30,993
You know how to whistle. You just
put your lips together and blow.

392
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:43,352
From the top of that flower,
we could see over the grass.

393
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,792
Let's climb.

394
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,553
No, Patty, no, no.
There's nothing to worry about.

395
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,792
Just have Amy call me if
you hear from her. Thanks.

396
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,668
Amy's not at Patty's and Nick's not at
the Koestlers'. I'm gonna call Betsy.

397
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,149
Well, they gotta be somewhere.
Did you check next door?

398
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,754
At the Thompsons'?
They'd rather be in school.

399
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,555
Nick, be careful.

400
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,438
Yes, Mother.

401
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,511
I'll go up with them.

402
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,277
It's Quark!

403
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,676
- Oh, no.
- What is it, Nick?

404
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,752
- It's that stupid cat of theirs!
- Our cat is not stupid.

405
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:48,719
- It just chased Quark away!
- It's Russ' stupid cat!

406
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:52,435
- Hang on, Nick!
- I can't! I'm slipping!

407
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,076
Nicky!

408
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,436
Nicky! Get out of there!

409
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,080
You're allergic to pollen!

410
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,630
It's too big!

411
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,836
I'm too little to breathe it in!

412
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,871
Diane!

413
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,757
Hi, Mae.

414
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,798
- We haven't seen you around much lately.
- Well, I've been working a lot.

415
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,713
You haven't seen Ronnie
or Russ, have you?

416
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,837
You know something?
I can't find Nick and Amy.

417
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,229
If you see them, would you
send them home right away?

418
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,880
Oh, sure. Uh, same thing
if you see mine.

419
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:41,036
Russell, the Szalinski kids
are missing too.

420
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,680
If they're smart,
they ran away with the circus.

421
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,876
I don't know where they could be.
They know we're leaving.

422
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,757
Ronald?

423
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,717
Russell?

424
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,473
Amy?

425
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,357
Nick?

426
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,397
Amy?

427
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,630
- What is it?
- It sounds like Mom.

428
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,950
Sounds more like a swarm of...

429
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,717
Bees!

430
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,713
- Amy! Get him off of me!
- Nicky!

431
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,870
- Get him away!
- Hold on, Nick!

432
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,512
- Russ!
- Nicky!

433
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:32,358
Nick, give me your hand!

434
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,908
- Nick, hold on!
- Russ!

435
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,230
We're never gonna find Russ now.
It's all your stupid Dad's fault!

436
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,153
Shut up!
My brother's up there too.

437
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,913
Help!

438
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,036
Russ, don't let go!

439
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,511
Hold on!

440
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,792
Help!

441
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,429
I'm getting worried. I'm gonna go
to the mall and look for the kids.

442
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,114
Why don't you stay here
in case they come back?

443
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,031
Okay.

444
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,031
Hey, Szalinski!

445
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,837
Your lawn's beginning
to look like the Amazon.

446
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,799
Yeah. Producing oxygen, Russ.
We've all gotta do our part.

447
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,791
You know, the jungles
are receding everywhere.

448
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,959
Dad!

449
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,997
- Don't!
- Stop! Stop, please! We're on the bee!

450
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,552
Wh... Where is it? Come on!

451
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,915
- Stop! Don't kill us!
- Dad, don't kill us!

452
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,709
Stop it! Whoa!

453
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,115
Hold on, Nick!
We're goin' down!

454
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,153
Wayne...

455
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,752
if the Boorsteins come by,
their escrow papers are in my briefcase.

456
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,274
You think you can handle that?

457
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,319
- There was a bee on me.
- Yeah, right.

458
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,191
Wait a second.

459
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,517
Nick doesn't play baseball.

460
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,674
I just figured it out.
I never woke up this morning.

461
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,591
This is all a bad dream.

462
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,478
- Ron, get up.
- You're just a nightmare!

463
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,710
When I get up,
Dad and I'll be going fishing.

464
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,360
I'm warning you.

465
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,032
Okay, Ron.
Maybe you're right.

466
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,554
Maybe this is just all a bad dream.

467
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:57,599
- But if it is, would this hurt?
- Ow!

468
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,353
Get up!

469
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,635
If you were my brother,
I'd put myself up for adoption.

470
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,314
Yeah, I hope your face
ends up on a milk carton.

471
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,990
My chair.

472
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,999
My couch.

473
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,231
It works.

474
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,631
Nick? Amy?

475
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,551
Can you hear me?

476
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,191
Nick.

477
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,834
Mm-hmm.

478
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,589
Nick.

479
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,954
Nick.

480
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,433
Nick?

481
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,956
Are you okay?

482
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,509
When we crashed, my entire life
flashed before my eyes.

483
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,868
It didn't take too long.

484
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,633
I'm scared, Russ.

485
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,636
We could be anywhere now.

486
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,551
- I think we're still in your yard.
- How do you know?

487
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,631
Any other yard,
the grass would be shorter.

488
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,678
Come on. We gotta find
Ron and your sister.

489
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,149
...and he'll go to jail.
Your mother too.

490
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:40,915
After all, she's the one who paid
for it. That makes her an accomplice.
You know what it's like in jail?

491
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,195
I am gonna tell you
one more time to shut up!

492
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,236
And then what?
And then you'll smack me?

493
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:50,274
You'll go to jail too. I'll tell them
after a big bee ate my brother,
you smacked me around.

494
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,920
No jury in the world
would fail to convict you.

495
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,912
- The whole Szalinski family's
gonna be in jail for life.
- Look.

496
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,433
My dad's machine works.

497
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:01,109
When we get home and he fixes us all,
we're gonna be so rich.

498
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,031
You'll regret this.

499
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,718
Amy. You know,
I've always liked your family.

500
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,637
I mean, your dad's
a real nice guy.

501
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:14,196
He's not as weird as I thought he was,
and I love you and Nick
like my own brother and sister.

502
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,034
It's just that my dad
doesn't understand your dad.

503
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,997
Your dad doesn't understand anything.

504
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,196
- Amy!
- Ron, where are you?

505
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,395
Run, Nick!

506
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,592
Whoa! Oh! Ow!

507
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,835
- Russ! Russ!
- Get up!

508
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,715
Get in there!

509
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,155
Get out of there!

510
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,434
- Harold.
- Uh, Mr. Szalinski?
Uh, we're the Boorsteins.

511
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,431
Get off the grass!

512
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,080
Get off the grass!

513
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,798
Up there!

514
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:16,869
Nicky!

515
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,350
- Amy!
- Get under that ledge!

516
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,592
It's very delicate, the lawn.

517
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,517
You don't want
to overwater, really.

518
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,353
Get her!

519
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,233
Amy?

520
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:41,999
Get away.

521
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,357
Please don't die.

522
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:06,835
Amy.

523
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:48,595
No, Cathy, I just thought
they might have stopped by.

524
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:51,194
Okay, listen. If you see them,
would you send them home?

525
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,236
Okay. You have a good weekend.

526
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:58,757
This is getting ridiculous.
Where the hell are those kids?

527
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,039
Oh, no.

528
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,749
You had to bring the dog. I don't want
to hear any more about the cat.

529
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,910
It's the Forresters!
What are we gonna tell 'em?

530
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,838
- How 'bout the truth?
- Mae, what kind of an excuse is that?

531
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,034
Don!

532
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,319
How 'bout catching some...

533
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,069
- Good morning, Russell.
- Hi, Gloria.

534
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:31,594
Say good morning, Sushi.

535
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:35,514
Well, the fishing report
looks stellar. Let's make exhaust
while the sun still shines, huh?

536
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:38,478
- I called Charlie up at Bass Lake.
- I know.
- He's says they're jumpin' in the boat.

537
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:42,838
- Don...
- Oh, and I bought my new Fish-matist.
- Donald, that man over there is flying.

538
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:45,593
- Right, Gloria.
- Don, uh, something's come up.

539
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,717
I don't think
we're gonna be able to make it.
Maybe you oughta go on ahead.

540
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,349
What do you... What do you mean you don't
think you're gonna be able to make it?
We're caravanning, good buddy.

541
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,675
- Donald, I am...
- Not now, Gloria!

542
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:57,354
And besides, if you're not there
by 6:00, you'll lose your deposit.

543
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,953
Confidentially...

544
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,037
Mae hasn't been feeling too well.

545
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,516
Plumbing.

546
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,113
"Plumbing"?

547
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,789
Well, this isn't
the Big Russ Thompson I know.

548
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,997
I mean, plumbing would not stop
the Big Russ Thompson I know...

549
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,196
especially with
an $80 deposit on the line.

550
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:19,431
Don, hook a big one for me, okay?

551
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,119
Don?

552
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,911
- Let's roll, Gloria.
- But, but...

553
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,638
- Come on. Get in.
- What's wrong with them?

554
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:39,948
Come on.

555
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:45,394
Mm-hmm.

556
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,719
- You tell him the truth?
- Honey!

557
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,711
- They take it okay?
- Mae.

558
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,996
Eighty bucks, Mae!
Non-refundable!

559
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:06,036
Those kids are grounded!

560
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,710
Mud is still mud,
no matter how small you are.

561
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,594
I can't believe some stores
actually charge for this stuff.

562
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,310
That was really great,
what you did for Nick.

563
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:31,351
What about you, Amy?
He saved you too.

564
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,556
Yeah, I know, Nick.

565
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:39,469
Where'd you learn
artificial respiration?

566
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,150
- French class, kid.
- Oh.

567
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,712
"French class"?

568
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,151
How 'bout a truce, okay?

569
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,229
Okay.

570
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,952
I think this is the flagstone
in the middle of the yard.

571
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,958
- You mean we're halfway there?
- Yeah, I think so.

572
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,268
Let's go.

573
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,193
French class.

574
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,879
I'd die for a strawberry sundae...

575
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,315
with chocolate sprinkles,
and a banana split.

576
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:00,589
I could eat a corn dog
the size of a truck.

577
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:04,678
Ron, if you had a corn dog,
it would be the size of a truck.

578
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:10,549
- I've died and gone to heaven.
- It's as big as a house!

579
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,995
I saw it first.
It's mine!

580
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:15,469
I got dibs on the cream filling!

581
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:17,437
Nick, it's one of your cookies!

582
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,868
They're never gonna
believe this at school.

583
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,758
Yeah, I could just see
the note to the teacher.

584
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,239
"Dear Miss Mason:

585
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:35,880
Nicky's not absent.
He's pinned to this note."

586
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:45,032
- Guys, quick! Over here!
- Where?

587
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:47,588
- Right there.
- Nicky, hurry!

588
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,517
If only we had some bug spray.
That'd show him.

589
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,478
Quiet.
To him, we're the bugs.

590
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:59,120
If he finds us, he'll eat us.
Let's get out of here.

591
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:03,159
Wait a minute. It's our cookie.
I say we fight for it.

592
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:06,073
- Just one ant.
- When is the last time
you saw just one ant?

593
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,588
- He's a scout. The rest of them
will be here any minute.
- Wait!

594
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:12,029
You ever see how fast ants go?

595
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:15,510
We could ride him and get back
to the house in no time.

596
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,079
Forget it, Nick.

597
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,830
Amy, he could take us all.

598
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,031
- Ants can lift 50 times their weight.
- 50 times?

599
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:26,714
That's like bench-pressing
a bulldozer!

600
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,234
Yeah, so think of what
he could do to us.

601
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,151
Let's go before he brings
the rest of them.

602
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,356
But he can't hurt us.
He's just a baby.

603
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,389
Russ?

604
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:41,238
- I say that ant is ours!
- Yeah!
- Come on, you guys!

605
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,788
Geronimo!

606
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:46,189
Get him!

607
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:48,077
You guys! Nicky!

608
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:51,470
- Get him!
- Nicky, you're gonna get hurt!
- Ron, be careful.

609
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,192
Yee-ha!

610
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,952
- Nick, get over there! Over there!
- You guys...

611
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,315
Get behind it!

612
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,835
- Get back here, Nicky!
- Watch out!

613
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:06,349
- Look out!
- Nick, the others
could come any second!

614
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,870
- Nicky!
- Go, Nick!

615
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,513
- Nicky, no! Get off of him!
- Nick, the wrong end!

616
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:19,149
- Nicky, you're allergic to ants.
Get away from him.
- Go over there.

617
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,592
- Nicky, get away!
- Ron, get on!

618
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,672
Hey, Szalinski, look at the head.

619
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,470
Ron, go for it!

620
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,518
Hey. Hello.

621
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,749
Ant!

622
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:40,714
Here.

623
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,598
Nice ant.
Come on, you guys.

624
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:49,474
You guys, come on.

625
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,880
Somebody take this cookie.

626
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:54,751
Nicky, take this thing!

627
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,638
Help! Nicky!

628
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:02,632
Come on, you guys.
This is your ant.

629
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,836
- Nicky, help me!
- She did it.

630
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,036
- Somebody, help me!
- Yeah.

631
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:09,350
- Your sister's not bad.
- Nicky!

632
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,351
- For a girl.
- Of course.

633
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:33,078
Quark, sit.
Sit, Quark.

634
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:35,674
Stop. Sit.
Sit, boy.

635
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,716
Quark, get away from there.

636
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,313
Quark. Here, boy.

637
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,278
Quark. Quark.

638
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:47,230
Get away, boy. Drop it!

639
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:49,197
Oh, whoa! Whoa!

640
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,953
Whoa!

641
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:57,319
Whoa!

642
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:01,279
Thank you, Officer.
We'd appreciate you sending somebody by.

643
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,510
Oh, okay, it's 646...

644
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,079
That guy's got serious problems.

645
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,434
<i>Mrs. Thompson? Hello?</i>

646
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,432
646 Sycamore. Yes.

647
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:23,190
Great idea, Russ, even if
the boy genius didn't think of it.

648
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,111
Low bridge!

649
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:30,111
At this rate,
we'll be home by dinner.

650
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:33,036
Maybe I can still go out...

651
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,071
with Patty.

652
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:39,789
Well, our weekend's shot.
We'll never get to go camping now.

653
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:42,075
I know Dad.
We're grounded.

654
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,879
We are camping, Ron,
only better.

655
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,428
- This is like a safari.
- Hey.

656
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,431
Yeah, I never thought
of it that way, you know.

657
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,753
Onward!

658
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,951
Amy?

659
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,473
Nick!

660
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,473
Wayne?

661
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:26,469
Uh, yeah, um, I would like
to report, um, two missing children.

662
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:29,074
Well, instead of flapping
your gums about it,
why don't you go out and...

663
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:32,197
I'm sure it's nothing to worry about.
This sort of thing happens all the time.

664
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:34,396
- You have a little spat with the kids...
- Whoa. We did not have a spat.

665
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:38,433
- You were kind of upset
about Russ quitting the team, hon.
- Quit? I thought he was cut.

666
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:41,114
- He was afraid to tell you he quit.
- Quit...

667
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:44,550
What do you mean he was afraid to tell
me? He could tell me anything he wants.
You know me. I'll always listen.

668
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,392
Mm-hmm.

669
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,232
- What's "Uh-huh" supposed to mean?
- Russell.

670
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:51,471
- No, I don't like the way he said it.
- No need to get upset, Mr. Thompson.

671
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:55,075
- You know, it's not unusual
for these runaways to...
- Whoa, my kids did not run away.

672
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:59,392
They are happy kids,
and there's no way you can
make me believe that they ran away.

673
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:02,153
There he goes with his writing again.
Don't you ever say anything?

674
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,434
Mm-hmm.

675
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:07,718
- Russell!
- Why do I feel like
I'm the one on trial here?

676
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,075
- Can't imagine, dear.
- What do you mean you can't imagine?

677
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,549
Well, I think we have
enough to get started.

678
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:15,234
Please give us a call
if you hear from the boys.

679
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:16,639
Fine.

680
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,556
Don't they need a warrant or something?

681
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:29,950
Russell, there's a few things
about yourself I think you should know.

682
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:34,476
- Well, like what?
- Well, I think you need to sit down.

683
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:40,074
Oh, another missing children report.

684
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:44,517
644 Sycamore.
That's next door.

685
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,077
I've called the police.
What's on your head?

686
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,355
- I was looking for the kids.
- Where, in a coal mine?

687
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:52,635
- They're in the backyard.
- They are?

688
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,631
Diane, I got something
real important to tell you.

689
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,148
That is the couch from the attic.

690
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,873
You can see the marks
where Quark chewed the arms.
I found it on the floor.

691
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:04,269
It's my thinking couch.

692
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:05,634
Wayne...

693
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:09,553
Are you trying to tell me...

694
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,392
You did it?

695
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:14,552
It works?
The machine works?

696
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,552
- Do the kids know?
- Well, yeah, the kids know.

697
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:19,551
- That's great.
- No, it's not that great.

698
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:21,790
- Why?
- I shrunk the kids.

699
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:23,393
- What?
- And the Thompson kids too.

700
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:26,040
- They're about this big.
They're in the backyard.
- What?

701
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:28,759
Threw them out with the trash.

702
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:30,990
Stay here.
I'll get the door.

703
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:33,358
Yes?

704
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,557
Did, uh, you report
some missing children?

705
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:40,558
Oh, there must be some mistake.
Ours are in the backyard. Right, honey?

706
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:46,759
She's w... Thank you.

707
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:52,071
Mm-hmm.

708
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,151
How ya doin', boy?
How about a pit stop?

709
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,914
- What is it, Ron?
- Antie needs a recharge.

710
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:20,874
Here. You deserve this.

711
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,836
We're not gonna make it before dark.

712
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:29,429
Yeah. Even if we did,
the mall would be closed.

713
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:33,513
Don't eat so fast.
Hey, that's my hand.

714
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:39,870
Why don't we let him go?
He's worn out, and his family
might be worried about him.

715
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:43,839
- It's okay with me.
- Yeah, me too, I guess.

716
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,797
Help me get off the harness.

717
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:56,557
You can go now.

718
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:02,795
Come on. Just start walking.
He'll get the idea.

719
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:07,552
Thanks for the lift, Antie.

720
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,749
You're free.
You get home now.

721
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,068
Shoo!

722
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:18,789
- Looks like you got a new pet.
- Dumb ant doesn't know
what's best for him.

723
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:24,036
Go on! Go home!
Mom will never let me keep you.

724
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,112
Amy? Nick?

725
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,111
- Nick?
- Are you there, kids?

726
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,111
Nicky.

727
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,758
Where are you?

728
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:42,949
- Any luck?
- No.

729
01:00:58,400 --> 01:00:59,674
Nick?

730
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,119
Amy?

731
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:10,279
- You see anything yet?
- It's too thick.

732
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:12,476
It's supposed to be thick.
It's grass.

733
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,955
Keep looking. Nick?

734
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,871
Amy?

735
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:25,954
- What was that?
- Ow!

736
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:27,314
Watch out!

737
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:30,355
Come on.

738
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,316
- Ugh.
- Where did that come from?

739
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:51,634
- Yeah, it's Dad's brand.
- He told us he quit.

740
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:58,198
Oof. Looks like
he started up again.

741
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:00,919
No. He only smokes when he's
really worried about something.

742
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:06,437
Nicky, be careful.

743
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:10,555
Hey. Hey, maybe we can use this.

744
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:28,394
Cool. Now we can
see in the dark.

745
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:36,510
Hey, Antie, look.
Headlights.

746
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,911
- I didn't force him to join the team.
- I know.

747
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,560
But you always make
a big deal out of sports.

748
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:46,394
- Because sports build character.
- No, they don't. They build muscle.

749
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:49,233
Russell, you've got to understand.
These kids aren't...

750
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:52,551
- Wayne?
- Yeah?

751
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:54,551
We've got to tell the Thompsons.

752
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:08,073
What do you take me for?
A complete idiot?

753
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,390
- How did this happen?
- Hold on a second, Mae.

754
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:13,438
I'll handle it. All right?
How did this happen?

755
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:16,193
Well, the machine analyzes the
molecular structure of each compound...

756
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:18,953
- and then through laser inversion,
it takes all the...
- Wait, Wayne, wait.

757
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:21,156
I think the Thompsons
need to see the couch.

758
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:25,629
This guy is a waste of skin.

759
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:30,072
- This is a microscope.
- I know.

760
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,069
Look in there.

761
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:34,594
All right.

762
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:39,230
You see, that's the couch that
used to be sitting right over here,
until the machine shrunk it.

763
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:41,515
All right, so there's
some doll furniture. Big deal.

764
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:44,319
They sell that kind of stuff
at swap meets.

765
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,231
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

766
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:49,312
Well, until now,
the machine just blew things up.

767
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,311
- Are you saying that that machine...
- Blew up my kids?

768
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:52,628
- No, no, no, no.
- Oh, no. No, no.

769
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:56,599
- If the machine had blown up the kids,
there'd be piece of them everywhere.
- Wayne!

770
01:03:57,640 --> 01:04:01,315
Sorry, I... Look.
I'm positive about this, okay?

771
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:04,278
- The machine shrunk our kids.
- You're the one
who needs a shrink, Szalinski.

772
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:07,591
- Russ.
- You are a nutcase,
and I'll tell you something.

773
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:10,114
I have got an air hammer
in my attic...

774
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:13,556
and if you did do something to my kids,
there's gonna be pieces of you
all over the neighborhood!

775
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:15,039
Come on, honey.

776
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:24,151
I think that went well.

777
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:26,708
I think we should
have them over more often.

778
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:29,109
Yeah, well,
it's a priority for me.

779
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,111
Now, why don't you do
what you're paid to do?

780
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:34,232
Find my kids.

781
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:48,111
I thought you didn't believe him.

782
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:50,508
Oh, I don't.

783
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:53,599
Electricity's cheap.

784
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:19,713
Come on. Look at this.

785
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:21,631
We don't have to sleep
on the ground.

786
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:27,190
- What is it?
- One of my Legos.

787
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:29,473
Give me a boost.

788
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:34,754
Hey.

789
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:37,639
Not bad.

790
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:42,997
Yeah. I don't even
have to brush my teeth.

791
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:47,714
- Quit pushing!
- Move over.
- You move over.

792
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:50,910
- Why don't you take that one?
- Are you sure?

793
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:53,950
Yeah. I'd rather sleep down here.

794
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:01,718
Night, Antie.

795
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:09,236
- Think they'll be warm enough?
- They look fine to me.

796
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:23,750
You think you'll be warm enough?

797
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:31,958
Good night, Russ.

798
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:34,913
Good night, Amy.

799
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:41,919
Good night, Amy.

800
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,231
Sorry, boy.
I need the parts.

801
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:48,356
<i>Meow!</i>

802
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:04,439
Are you okay?

803
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:06,954
I'm scared.

804
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:12,633
Somehow I feel
like this is all our fault.

805
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:14,551
No, it's my fault.

806
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:18,991
I start working on something, and I...
I don't think about anything else.

807
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:23,598
I should have been more careful
with that thing. I'm sorry.

808
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:27,797
That's not what I meant.

809
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:31,870
You know, it's not important...

810
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:34,474
if I sell another house...

811
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:36,755
or if you get a grant
this year or next.

812
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:41,270
We've just got to get
this family back together.

813
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,718
I feel the same way.

814
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:58,792
I gotta fix the machine.
You should get some sleep.

815
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:01,713
We've got to get up early
and come out here and look for them.

816
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:04,079
No, I couldn't sleep.

817
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:07,516
Not with my babies
out here all alone.

818
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:11,438
Ah, don't worry about them.
They got the Thompson kids with them.

819
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:12,953
They'll be fine.

820
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,311
That's another thing
I'm worried about.

821
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:19,674
Amy in the dark...

822
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:21,671
with little Russ Thompson.

823
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:23,113
Get some rest.

824
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:31,475
They'd better behave themselves.

825
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:37,678
It's funny.

826
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:40,433
The moon looks the same size
whether you're big or small.

827
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:43,398
Yeah.
Tell that to my dad.

828
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:47,071
Why? Does he pick on you
about your size?

829
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:50,557
The bigger the guy,
the bigger the moon.

830
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:54,233
It's just the way he thinks.

831
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:55,912
Russ?

832
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:59,031
- Yeah?
- How come you never came over before?

833
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:02,919
Well...

834
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:07,998
I mean...

835
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:10,150
you talked to me
once or twice last year.

836
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:14,478
I mean, I would have come by.
I wanted to, but...

837
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:18,590
I just always thought
you were too popular to notice me.

838
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:22,236
I was too popular to notice.

839
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:25,154
I was stupid.

840
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,798
- Get down! Hurry!
- Get down! Hurry!

841
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,916
Ron, get down!

842
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,274
Run!

843
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:59,071
Russ! Help!

844
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:03,518
- Russ, help!
- Help him!

845
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:04,828
Russ!

846
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:07,428
Stay here.

847
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:19,234
No!

848
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:23,708
Ron, get out! Quick!
Get away!

849
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:35,958
- Come on, Ron! Hurry!
- Come on!

850
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:43,676
He-He'll get killed.

851
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:46,149
- We've got to do something.
He's just a baby.
- Sit down.

852
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:56,348
We gotta help him.

853
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:10,073
Now!

854
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:13,308
- Get him!
- Get him!

855
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:24,231
- Let him go!
- Look out!

856
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:31,113
Back!

857
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:49,714
Where's Antie?

858
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:57,155
- Antie!
- There!

859
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:04,231
Oh, my God.

860
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,197
- He looks hurt.
- No!

861
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,198
You saved my life.

862
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,159
No, he's gonna be okay.

863
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:34,270
Where you going?

864
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:35,713
Nature calls.

865
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:45,156
Boys on the right,
girls on the left.

866
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:48,511
I must look absolutely gross.

867
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:14,431
I love you, Wayne Szalinski.

868
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:01,155
Okay, guys, let's get moving.
Can't be much farther.

869
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:03,549
Can't we sleep just a little longer?

870
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,871
Something's very weird here.

871
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:22,552
- What is it?
- Earthquake!

872
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:26,155
No, worse! Lawn mower!

873
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:54,391
Nicky!

874
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:25,388
- What is this?
- I don't know, but I hope
whatever lived here has moved out.

875
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:28,153
This is the burrow of
a <i>Lumbricus terrestris.</i>

876
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:31,994
- A what?
- Earthworm. They're dormant
this time of year.

877
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:35,479
Plug that in.

878
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:39,069
We're almost done here.

879
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,911
Is that a chain saw?

880
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,560
No, it's more like
our lawn mower, I think.

881
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:56,873
- Tommy, stop the lawn mower!
- Tommy!

882
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:00,599
Tommy, stop!

883
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:04,633
- Tommy!
- Tommy!

884
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:07,075
- Tommy! Don't go on the grass!
- Tommy, stop... Tom, get over here!

885
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:09,116
- Tommy!
- Tommy!
- All right, together!

886
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,633
One, two, three.

887
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:13,951
Tommy! Tommy!

888
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:19,357
I think we'll be safe in here.

889
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:25,758
Nicky!

890
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:27,432
Come on! Come on!

891
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:33,588
No! No!

892
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:37,955
Hold on to me, Russ!

893
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:41,477
Amy, don't let go!

894
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:45,198
Amy!

895
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:49,880
- Hold on!
- Give me that thing!

896
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:01,591
- Nick said I could cut it...
- When did you see Nick?

897
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:04,399
- Did you see him this morning?
- No, it was yesterday.

898
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:06,516
Really, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to be so late.

899
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:09,831
It's okay, sweetie, it's okay.
Here. Why don't you go home.
Go on through the house. It's safer.

900
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:14,234
"Safer"?

901
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:20,436
I thought my folks are weird.

902
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:28,114
My knee.

903
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:30,878
Is everyone okay?

904
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:32,996
I feel like a banana whip.

905
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:42,795
Nick? Nick, are you all right?

906
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:46,594
Nicky!

907
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:53,593
Dad?

908
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:56,714
Mom!

909
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,518
- Down here!
- Mom! Mom, Dad!

910
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,875
- Dad! We're down here!
- Over here!

911
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:03,315
- Mr. Szalinski!
- Down here!

912
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:05,516
- Dad!
- Mr. Szalinski!

913
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:21,239
We'll make it, Nick.

914
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:22,912
They're never gonna find us.

915
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,468
We were right under their noses,
and they didn't even see us!

916
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:27,630
Don't panic, Ron.
W-We'll f-find a way, okay?

917
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:30,712
I'm not panicked. Who's panicked?
Nobody's panicked!

918
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,351
Quark!

919
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:38,034
Come on, everybody!
Grab on!

920
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:41,396
Go inside, Quark!
Find Dad!

921
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:03,238
Nicky!

922
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:06,159
Quark, what's gotten into you?

923
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:11,599
- Dad!
- I think he just misses the kids.

924
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:13,671
Dad! Stop!

925
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:16,633
No!

926
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:22,076
- Dad!
- I'll tell you, at their size...

927
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:24,469
- Dad!
- Mr. Szalinski!
- that backyard is like ten miles.

928
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:26,471
Giant blades of grass.

929
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:28,152
Huge insects.

930
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:31,596
- It's a jungle out there.
- They're gonna head
right for the house.

931
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:34,393
- It's us!
- Dad!

932
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:36,675
Yeah, you're probably right.

933
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:38,239
No!

934
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:43,558
- We're down here!
- Mr. Szalinski!

935
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:46,551
No, Dad!

936
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:53,474
- Dad!
- No!
- Dad!

937
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:56,154
- We just gotta keep our eyes open.
- Help!

938
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:57,719
Don't eat me!

939
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:03,833
Oh, my God.
Look at this.

940
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:07,953
No, Dad! Dad!

941
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:10,076
- It's Nick!
- Oh, Nicky!

942
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:12,355
- Hi, baby.
- He's pointing at something.

943
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:17,150
- Look! It's the rest of them!
- Yeah!

944
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:19,071
- Yeah!
- We're saved!

945
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:22,152
- I'm gonna go get the Thompsons.
- Hang on, kids.

946
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:26,353
It obviously worked on the kids.
I just don't get it.

947
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:31,749
- Well, you better get it, Szalinski.
- Russ, you're not helping.

948
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:33,990
- So I'm not helping.
- Russell, you've got to understand...
- I know.

949
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:36,958
- these kids aren't you.
- Baseball!

950
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:39,349
- Nick's trying to say something.
- Baseball!

951
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:41,908
- I can't make it out.
- Let me see.

952
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:45,835
The baseball, Dad!

953
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:47,717
What are you saying, Nick?

954
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:53,313
Swinging?

955
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:55,960
- Sounds like...
- It's semaphore, Mae.

956
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:58,395
Wait. Uh, uh, flapping!

957
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,630
- Pitching.
- Um...
- Throwing.

958
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:03,712
- You're out! You're out!
- Baseball!

959
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:06,951
- Dad!
- Right!
- The baseball!
- The ball!

960
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:09,634
- Baseball?
- Good, honey!

961
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:14,669
Holy smokes.
It's the laser.

962
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:19,075
I got it. The ball
came through the window...

963
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:23,392
and activated the machine,
and they got in the path of the laser.

964
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:26,756
- Why didn't I think of this before?
- I could take a wild guess.

965
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:29,479
- Shh.
- It's creating too much heat.
That's why everything was blowing up.

966
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:31,915
- Thanks, Nick.
- All right, Nicky.

967
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,434
- Diane, you take the spoon.
I'll get the machine.
- Hold it, Szalinski.

968
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:38,433
This gizmo's been blowing up fruit.
Now, you're not trying it on my kids
until you try it on something living!

969
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:44,157
You know something,
maybe I should do it on myself.

970
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:46,071
- I'll show you how to work
the machine. It's not that hard.
- I don't know.

971
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:49,789
- I'll fix it up. It'll be no trouble.
- No, no! Do it on me.

972
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:51,108
Are you sure, honey?

973
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:58,276
How'd those get there?

974
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:15,029
Okay, Szalinski, shoot.

975
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:18,151
- No reason this shouldn't work now.
- Huh?

976
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:35,598
- Stand back.
- Oh, honey, you're so brave.

977
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:37,989
Come on, Mae. Come on. Come.

978
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:53,872
- Russ, are you okay?
- Yeah. Why?

979
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:13,671
So, if this works,
you wanna go to the dance on Friday?

980
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:16,873
Can you dance?

981
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:21,559
- Not really.
- I'd love to.

982
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:44,033
- Oh!
- Russ! Ron!
- Dad!

983
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:46,429
Oh, I knew my boys
wouldn't run away.

984
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:49,272
Are you and Dad okay?

985
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:52,033
- Yeah, honey.
...all the way
across the yard, for miles.
- We're great.

986
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:53,951
- Really?
- Sorry about the grass stains, Mom.

987
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:56,395
Oh, don't worry, honey.
I'll get 'em out.

988
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:59,392
He saved me from a giant scorpion.
I was stuck with Amy for a while.
She's all right.

989
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:01,789
I was right, wasn't I?
It was the ball, wasn't it?

990
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:04,678
You were right.
You were brilliant.

991
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:09,197
- I wanted to go fishing, Dad.
I didn't mean to mess everything up.
- I know, Ronnie, I know.

992
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:11,919
Dad, if you really want me
back on the team...

993
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,275
I don't care about the team.
I care about you.

994
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:17,839
- Proud of you.
- I got better.

995
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:20,718
- I need to take a shower.
- Szalinski.

996
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:31,679
- Let's eat.
- Honey, make a toast.

997
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:33,637
- Good idea.
- Oh, great.
- Oh, I love toasts.

998
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:36,598
To the Thompsons and the Szalinskis
and many more dinners together.

999
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:40,229
- Cheers.
- Though I think we're going to be
having leftovers for a while.

1000
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:41,833
- I wonder what's
for dinner, right, Russ?
- Who wants bread?

1001
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:44,150
- Ron?
- Well, I guess I gotta
carve this thing, huh?

1002
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:46,515
- Hey, you wanna use my chain saw?
- Do we have butter?

1003
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:49,353
- Who wants bread?
- Save some room for cake.

1004
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:52,034
- Oh, we got cake for dessert?
- Yeah.
- Who wants bread?

1005
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:00,237
Hey, wait!

1006
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:02,072
I get it!

1007
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:05,072
French class! Ha-ha!
