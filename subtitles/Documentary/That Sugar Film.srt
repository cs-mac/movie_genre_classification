1
00:01:19,734 --> 00:01:22,051
My name is Damon Gameau.

2
00:01:22,151 --> 00:01:24,717
This is my weatherboard house.

3
00:01:24,817 --> 00:01:27,859
This is a time-lapse
of my girlfriend's pregnancy.

4
00:01:27,984 --> 00:01:29,634
There's three months to go.

5
00:01:29,734 --> 00:01:32,967
And this is a photo of me at age 10.

6
00:01:33,067 --> 00:01:36,734
I was a rare boy whose face
grew into his teeth.

7
00:01:38,067 --> 00:01:40,717
Five years ago,
when I met my girlfriend,

8
00:01:40,817 --> 00:01:42,717
I was pretty much living on cigarettes,

9
00:01:42,817 --> 00:01:45,567
sugar and my homemade Australian pizzas.

10
00:01:47,276 --> 00:01:48,759
But then, as men often do,

11
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:52,467
they feign interest in things
to impress a girl.

12
00:01:52,567 --> 00:01:53,967
The lovers' bike.

13
00:01:54,067 --> 00:01:56,026
For me, it was healthy eating.

14
00:01:57,109 --> 00:02:00,817
I actually cut out refined sugar
from my diet to seal the deal.

15
00:02:03,192 --> 00:02:06,342
But now sugar is
dominating the headlines

16
00:02:06,442 --> 00:02:08,859
and there's so much debate
and conjecture on the topic

17
00:02:08,984 --> 00:02:11,634
that it's hard to know what to believe.

18
00:02:11,734 --> 00:02:13,509
But with this little person on the way,

19
00:02:13,609 --> 00:02:16,317
I feel like I need some
definitive answers.

20
00:02:18,109 --> 00:02:20,859
If the average Australian family of four

21
00:02:20,984 --> 00:02:24,301
had to buy the sugar
they are consuming in a week,

22
00:02:24,401 --> 00:02:26,467
they would be going to the supermarket,

23
00:02:26,567 --> 00:02:31,259
taking six 1-kilo bags of sugar
off the shelves... six...

24
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:35,259
taking it home, eating it all that week

25
00:02:35,359 --> 00:02:37,676
and then going back next week
and doing it again.

26
00:02:37,776 --> 00:02:43,134
Clearly, the ability to be
on a high-sugar diet

27
00:02:43,234 --> 00:02:45,801
is really new,

28
00:02:45,901 --> 00:02:50,984
especially in terms of
evolutionary time zone.

29
00:02:55,067 --> 00:02:58,634
Sugar has become
so prevalent in today's society

30
00:02:58,734 --> 00:03:01,801
that if you removed
all the items containing it

31
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:03,984
from a standard supermarket's shelves...

32
00:03:05,401 --> 00:03:07,567
just 20% of items would remain.

33
00:03:27,942 --> 00:03:29,717
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,

34
00:03:29,817 --> 00:03:32,984
this is the condensed history of sugar.

35
00:03:41,442 --> 00:03:45,134
The first reports of sugar came
from New Guinea in 8000 BC.

36
00:03:45,234 --> 00:03:48,467
Local mythology says that
the human race came about

37
00:03:48,567 --> 00:03:52,009
after a man made love to
the stalk of a sugar cane.

38
00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:53,634
Ow.

39
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,134
Then, via trader migration routes,

40
00:03:56,234 --> 00:04:00,317
the cane made its way to India.

41
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:05,151
Thank you.

42
00:04:06,567 --> 00:04:10,967
In the 12th century,
sugar arrived in Europe.

43
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:12,009
And, due to its rarity,

44
00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:15,009
it quickly became
a status symbol for royalty.

45
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:17,984
Queen Elizabeth I had
a real love of sugar.

46
00:04:21,151 --> 00:04:25,484
So much so that her teeth rotted
and went black from it.

47
00:04:26,651 --> 00:04:28,484
Eugh.

48
00:04:32,192 --> 00:04:33,967
At the start of the 20th century,

49
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:35,967
sugar was still seen as a treat...

50
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,676
something you would add to
a cup of tea or cup of coffee...

51
00:04:38,776 --> 00:04:41,592
but then, in 1955, an event occurred

52
00:04:41,692 --> 00:04:44,051
that significantly influenced

53
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:49,609
the amount of sugar we eat today.

54
00:04:55,942 --> 00:04:58,217
A stunned nation
hears that its president

55
00:04:58,317 --> 00:04:59,967
is stricken with a heart attack at...

56
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:02,967
On September 23, 1955,

57
00:05:03,067 --> 00:05:05,092
the US President Dwight Eisenhower

58
00:05:05,192 --> 00:05:07,051
suffered a heart attack

59
00:05:07,151 --> 00:05:08,467
and the issue of heart disease

60
00:05:08,567 --> 00:05:10,759
was thrust into the public domain.

61
00:05:10,859 --> 00:05:12,134
Summoned to the hospital,

62
00:05:12,234 --> 00:05:14,176
a famed Boston heart specialist...

63
00:05:14,276 --> 00:05:16,467
Two strong theories emerged.

64
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:19,967
One, led by an American
scientist named Ancel Keys,

65
00:05:20,067 --> 00:05:21,734
who declared that fat was the problem...

66
00:05:22,901 --> 00:05:25,676
while a British doctor named John Yudkin

67
00:05:25,776 --> 00:05:27,176
believed sugar was to blame.

68
00:05:27,276 --> 00:05:30,759
I'd be very happy if everybody
ate four pounds of sugar a year.

69
00:05:30,859 --> 00:05:32,734
They eat a hundred pounds!

70
00:05:35,859 --> 00:05:37,467
Over the next two decades,

71
00:05:37,567 --> 00:05:40,317
the discussion brought fierce
arguments from both camps.

72
00:05:42,401 --> 00:05:47,217
But by the end of the 1970s,
Ancel Keys had won out.

73
00:05:47,317 --> 00:05:50,217
Fat became the villain,
sugar was exonerated,

74
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:53,109
and the low-fat movement
was in full swing.

75
00:05:54,567 --> 00:05:56,467
We institutionalised this idea

76
00:05:56,567 --> 00:05:58,634
that a low-fat diet is a healthy diet.

77
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:01,384
So what you want to do is remove fats...

78
00:06:01,484 --> 00:06:03,092
This is how industry perceived this.

79
00:06:03,192 --> 00:06:05,967
We're gonna remove fat
from otherwise healthy foods,

80
00:06:06,067 --> 00:06:09,301
and when we do this
we have to replace the calories,

81
00:06:09,401 --> 00:06:11,676
we have to make sure
we have the right mouth feel.

82
00:06:11,776 --> 00:06:13,859
And it has to taste as good
as it did with fat,

83
00:06:13,984 --> 00:06:15,609
and the best way to
do that is with sugar.

84
00:06:19,067 --> 00:06:21,217
With sugar now
saturating our food supply

85
00:06:21,317 --> 00:06:25,509
and the constant confusion
over its effects on our health,

86
00:06:25,609 --> 00:06:27,759
the only real way to get some answers

87
00:06:27,859 --> 00:06:30,051
is for me to start eating sugar again

88
00:06:30,151 --> 00:06:31,984
and see what it does to my body.

89
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:36,467
So the first step is to set up
an experiment

90
00:06:36,567 --> 00:06:38,192
with the help of a team of experts.

91
00:06:39,651 --> 00:06:42,984
My chief sugar adviser is
the author David Gillespie...

92
00:06:44,067 --> 00:06:46,567
aka The Crusader.

93
00:06:47,984 --> 00:06:49,301
In charge of my blood tests

94
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:52,801
is one of Australia's
leading clinical pathologists,

95
00:06:52,901 --> 00:06:57,217
Dr Ken Sikaris, aka Professor Blood.

96
00:06:57,317 --> 00:07:00,026
My nutritionist is Sharon Johnston...

97
00:07:01,401 --> 00:07:03,592
the Celtic Food Queen.

98
00:07:03,692 --> 00:07:07,259
And supervising my overall
health is Dr Debbie Herbst,

99
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:10,026
aka Check Upz.

100
00:07:11,317 --> 00:07:13,092
OK, so, I want to do this mission,

101
00:07:13,192 --> 00:07:15,342
I want to find out
what sugar does to me.

102
00:07:15,442 --> 00:07:17,176
What kind of things do I need to do?

103
00:07:17,276 --> 00:07:19,967
If you want to match
Australian averages,

104
00:07:20,067 --> 00:07:22,051
you're gonna have to be in the range,

105
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:24,651
40 teaspoons of sugar a day.

106
00:07:26,734 --> 00:07:28,717
- 40 a day?
- Yeah, 40 a day.

107
00:07:28,817 --> 00:07:31,551
That's what's embedded in
most of the processed food

108
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:32,717
that most people are eating.

109
00:07:32,817 --> 00:07:34,259
So...

110
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:36,009
Right, so does that mean
I'm gonna eat a lot

111
00:07:36,109 --> 00:07:38,676
of these kind of sour rainbow blowpipes?

112
00:07:38,776 --> 00:07:41,467
I mean, is that... How am
I gonna get to 40 teaspoons?

113
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:45,092
You won't need to come near a place
like this to get to 40 teaspoons.

114
00:07:45,192 --> 00:07:47,967
You just go to a supermarket
and you'll get to 40 teaspoons.

115
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:49,092
Right.

116
00:07:49,192 --> 00:07:52,634
The point is to test out
a very high sugar diet

117
00:07:52,734 --> 00:07:55,967
and to see what effects we get,
what changes I notice in the body.

118
00:07:56,067 --> 00:07:59,801
Two months, I wanna eat
40 teaspoons of sugar a day.

119
00:07:59,901 --> 00:08:02,842
- 40 teaspoons?!
- 40 teaspoons.

120
00:08:02,942 --> 00:08:04,592
How are you gonna do that?

121
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:07,967
Off-the-shelf breakfast cereals,
like Just Right,

122
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:09,967
low-fat flavoured yoghurt.

123
00:08:10,067 --> 00:08:12,859
Another good one would be
some beans on toast.

124
00:08:12,984 --> 00:08:14,467
Baked beans?!

125
00:08:14,567 --> 00:08:17,342
One serving of an iced tea,

126
00:08:17,442 --> 00:08:20,134
you'll end up with nearly
nine teaspoons of sugar.

127
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:22,009
If I can achieve 40 teaspoons a day

128
00:08:22,109 --> 00:08:25,342
without touching perceived
candy or junk food...

129
00:08:25,442 --> 00:08:27,592
I mean, I can't quite fathom
that's possible,

130
00:08:27,692 --> 00:08:30,217
but if we can do that
and see some changes,

131
00:08:30,317 --> 00:08:32,967
then that's, yeah, that seems
like a pretty good story.

132
00:08:33,067 --> 00:08:34,967
A lot of your health markers
are going to be going

133
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:36,634
in very much the wrong direction,

134
00:08:36,734 --> 00:08:39,342
and I'm very glad to hear
that you're gonna be having

135
00:08:39,442 --> 00:08:41,801
some medical supervision,
'cause I think you're gonna need it.

136
00:08:41,901 --> 00:08:43,676
Anyone in the family have diabetes?

137
00:08:43,776 --> 00:08:45,551
- No.
- OK.

138
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:47,134
- Not that I know of.
- Not that you know of? Good.

139
00:08:47,234 --> 00:08:48,676
And heart disease?

140
00:08:48,776 --> 00:08:52,109
No. All pretty thin
and wiry Irish or French folk.

141
00:09:02,651 --> 00:09:06,676
We're going to look at how the
blood sugar changes, obviously.

142
00:09:06,776 --> 00:09:09,967
We've got blood tests that can
look at the effect of the heart.

143
00:09:10,067 --> 00:09:12,967
But, even more than that,
we're looking for the changes

144
00:09:13,067 --> 00:09:17,967
that might occur in the liver
and its production of fat.

145
00:09:18,067 --> 00:09:19,801
I'd like to go to 1932, please.

146
00:09:19,901 --> 00:09:21,467
Done.

147
00:09:21,567 --> 00:09:22,817
Coming.

148
00:09:31,192 --> 00:09:32,984
Let's just see how tall you are.

149
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:39,384
So you've got a really normal,
healthy blood pressure...

150
00:09:39,484 --> 00:09:41,092
121 over 79.

151
00:09:41,192 --> 00:09:43,634
Your heart rate's pretty good
at 75, so that's pretty good.

152
00:09:43,734 --> 00:09:46,051
Alrighty, so, we'll just have
a listen to your heart,

153
00:09:46,151 --> 00:09:47,859
see what it sounds like.

154
00:09:49,901 --> 00:09:51,676
You know what it's saying, Damon.

155
00:09:51,776 --> 00:09:52,801
Don't do this crazy thing?

156
00:09:52,901 --> 00:09:54,592
Exactly. That's exactly
what I heard it saying.

157
00:09:54,692 --> 00:09:56,467
There are some tests that we're doing

158
00:09:56,567 --> 00:09:57,801
just to make sure

159
00:09:57,901 --> 00:09:59,842
that you're not doing
anything too stupid here.

160
00:09:59,942 --> 00:10:03,217
Usually I'm telling people not
to eat all this sort of stuff,

161
00:10:03,317 --> 00:10:04,217
so...

162
00:10:04,317 --> 00:10:07,051
I personally think you're
insane for doing it at all.

163
00:10:07,151 --> 00:10:09,467
But... No, no, no, honestly.
I think it's dangerous.

164
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,842
But I guess on the plus side,

165
00:10:11,942 --> 00:10:13,609
everybody else is already doing it.

166
00:10:17,276 --> 00:10:19,651
So, this is where my
health stands pre-experiment.

167
00:10:21,276 --> 00:10:26,301
My total calorie intake is
approximately 2,300 a day.

168
00:10:26,401 --> 00:10:30,342
With 50% coming from good
fats like avocado and nuts,

169
00:10:30,442 --> 00:10:34,259
26% from protein such as eggs,
meat or fish,

170
00:10:34,359 --> 00:10:38,217
and 24% from carbohydrates
like fresh vegetables.

171
00:10:38,317 --> 00:10:40,759
And of course there is no refined sugar.

172
00:10:40,859 --> 00:10:43,217
I currently weigh 76kg

173
00:10:43,317 --> 00:10:46,134
with a waist circumference of 84cm.

174
00:10:46,234 --> 00:10:48,842
My blood tests showed
a very healthy liver,

175
00:10:48,942 --> 00:10:50,676
a very low level of triglyceride,

176
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:52,342
which is fat in the bloodstream,

177
00:10:52,442 --> 00:10:56,509
and, thankfully, no sign of
insulin resistance or diabetes.

178
00:10:56,609 --> 00:10:58,967
Overall, I rated slightly healthier

179
00:10:59,067 --> 00:11:01,651
than the average Western male of my age.

180
00:11:04,942 --> 00:11:07,859
The next step in the experiment
was to do a shop.

181
00:11:09,234 --> 00:11:11,634
To calculate my 40 teaspoons,

182
00:11:11,734 --> 00:11:13,759
I need to keep in mind that one teaspoon

183
00:11:13,859 --> 00:11:16,109
equals roughly four grams of sugar.

184
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:20,317
But I also need a lesson
in the different types of sugar.

185
00:11:23,192 --> 00:11:25,859
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,

186
00:11:25,984 --> 00:11:28,651
it's time to meet the sugar family.

187
00:11:30,067 --> 00:11:33,051
When we eat certain foods,
they adhere to a rule.

188
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:37,259
They break down to glucose
which our body uses for fuel.

189
00:11:37,359 --> 00:11:40,592
Breads, pasta, vegies and grain

190
00:11:40,692 --> 00:11:44,859
all turn to glucose
to be used by our brain.

191
00:11:44,984 --> 00:11:46,467
Ooh!

192
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:49,967
But also our cells and our organs, too.

193
00:11:50,067 --> 00:11:54,342
So without any glucose
there would be no you.

194
00:11:54,442 --> 00:11:57,801
Lactose is next,
and she's as smooth as silk.

195
00:11:57,901 --> 00:11:59,759
She's the first sugar mammals have...

196
00:11:59,859 --> 00:12:01,051
it's in their mother's milk.

197
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:05,259
You'll find it in cheese and
milk and tubs of yoghurt, too.

198
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:07,217
But take care if you're intolerant,

199
00:12:07,317 --> 00:12:09,259
you'll be rushing to the loo.

200
00:12:09,359 --> 00:12:13,734
Now, sucrose is the sugar
that all the fuss is about.

201
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:19,134
Some say it's dangerous
while others still have doubt.

202
00:12:19,234 --> 00:12:23,967
Sucrose is the table sugar
we have in coffee or tea.

203
00:12:24,067 --> 00:12:27,484
She's the sugar family's
sweet little daughter.

204
00:12:28,817 --> 00:12:30,634
Or not, apparently.

205
00:12:30,734 --> 00:12:31,817
Ooh.

206
00:12:33,776 --> 00:12:36,634
Now, this table sugar, or sucrose,

207
00:12:36,734 --> 00:12:38,859
is made up of two sugars.

208
00:12:38,984 --> 00:12:44,967
It is 50% glucose, the head of
the family, plus 50% fructose.

209
00:12:45,067 --> 00:12:47,967
Now, fructose may well be

210
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:51,509
the sugar family's
mischievous teenage son,

211
00:12:51,609 --> 00:12:56,842
because in the past this
fructose was very, very rare.

212
00:12:56,942 --> 00:13:01,717
It was found in fruit and vegies
and honey, if you dared.

213
00:13:01,817 --> 00:13:05,842
But now we find it everywhere!

214
00:13:05,942 --> 00:13:09,092
In so many foods we eat.

215
00:13:09,192 --> 00:13:12,676
And you'll always know
if you're eating fructose

216
00:13:12,776 --> 00:13:16,467
'cause it's the thing
that makes food sweet.

217
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:21,676
You see, people on this planet
are growing sicker every day,

218
00:13:21,776 --> 00:13:23,967
and many scientists now believe

219
00:13:24,067 --> 00:13:27,567
that fructose has a role to play.

220
00:13:31,942 --> 00:13:34,009
- Hey, hey!
- The first load.

221
00:13:34,109 --> 00:13:38,467
Why don't we make these
middle shelves the sugar zone?

222
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:42,026
- I love it.
- Here's some juicy juice.

223
00:13:43,401 --> 00:13:45,551
- Juice boxes, babe.
- Yep.

224
00:13:45,651 --> 00:13:47,026
Up&Go.

225
00:13:50,734 --> 00:13:53,301
So, here are the rules
for my next 60 days.

226
00:13:53,401 --> 00:13:56,676
I must consume 40 teaspoons
of sugar a day,

227
00:13:56,776 --> 00:13:58,509
but they must be hidden sugars

228
00:13:58,609 --> 00:14:01,467
found in commonly perceived
healthy foods and drinks.

229
00:14:01,567 --> 00:14:06,051
So no soft drink, chocolate,
confectionary or ice-cream.

230
00:14:06,151 --> 00:14:09,342
These 40 teaspoons of sugar
will consist of sucrose

231
00:14:09,442 --> 00:14:11,467
and fructose specifically.

232
00:14:11,567 --> 00:14:14,967
They can be added, like jam,
or naturally occurring,

233
00:14:15,067 --> 00:14:16,634
like sultanas.

234
00:14:16,734 --> 00:14:19,301
I must always choose low-fat foods

235
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:23,592
and maintain the same level
of exercise as I already do.

236
00:14:23,692 --> 00:14:25,967
That's three laps of my garden
twice a week

237
00:14:26,067 --> 00:14:29,134
and a 10-minute workout
on my homemade gym.

238
00:14:29,234 --> 00:14:32,276
And by homemade, I mean homemade.

239
00:14:38,984 --> 00:14:41,984
Tomorrow morning I start.
What are your feelings?

240
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:45,192
Uh...

241
00:14:47,859 --> 00:14:49,234
I hope you're OK.

242
00:14:58,734 --> 00:15:02,676
Darling, do we have a metric cup,
like, to measure size?

243
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,134
Yep.

244
00:15:04,234 --> 00:15:05,967
Right, so, this Just Right tells me

245
00:15:06,067 --> 00:15:10,217
that it's 12 grams of sugar
per serving, right?

246
00:15:10,317 --> 00:15:11,467
So, that's...

247
00:15:11,567 --> 00:15:13,634
Divided by four, that's roughly three...

248
00:15:13,734 --> 00:15:16,026
three teaspoons of sugar per serving.

249
00:15:18,234 --> 00:15:20,092
That's a recommended serving size

250
00:15:20,192 --> 00:15:21,676
with three teaspoons of sugar.

251
00:15:21,776 --> 00:15:23,759
Now, I don't know about you
but I'm a growing boy.

252
00:15:23,859 --> 00:15:25,509
I'm gonna need
a little bit more of that.

253
00:15:25,609 --> 00:15:28,009
That feels like a shot of Just Right.

254
00:15:28,109 --> 00:15:29,651
Yeah, maybe 2.5.

255
00:15:31,067 --> 00:15:32,484
OK, so, 2.5...

256
00:15:33,776 --> 00:15:37,717
So, one was just under three
teaspoons, two is six teaspoons,

257
00:15:37,817 --> 00:15:41,717
and the other half
is about 7.5 teaspoons of sugar,

258
00:15:41,817 --> 00:15:42,967
just in that bowl.

259
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,759
And I haven't added the yoghurt yet.

260
00:15:44,859 --> 00:15:49,342
Per serving there is 27 grams,

261
00:15:49,442 --> 00:15:54,134
but a lot of that's gonna be
lactose, so I reckon 18 grams.

262
00:15:54,234 --> 00:15:57,817
18 divided by 4 is just over 4.

263
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:02,842
So, four to my seven, so there's
11 teaspoons of sugar,

264
00:16:02,942 --> 00:16:04,967
and then I've gotta add my juice.

265
00:16:05,067 --> 00:16:09,759
I'm gonna put about 400 mils
of apple juice, that will do me.

266
00:16:09,859 --> 00:16:14,051
There we're looking at nine
teaspoons, so this combined,

267
00:16:14,151 --> 00:16:18,276
I'm looking at nearly
20 teaspoons to start the day.

268
00:16:22,692 --> 00:16:23,759
Hey, David. How are you going?

269
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:25,009
Good. How are you?

270
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:28,176
Mate, I've just got a quick question.
We just were...

271
00:16:28,276 --> 00:16:30,259
I just sort of had my first breakfast

272
00:16:30,359 --> 00:16:33,259
and it got to about 20 teaspoons.

273
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:34,859
20 teaspoons?!

274
00:16:34,984 --> 00:16:36,509
I almost couldn't believe it.

275
00:16:36,609 --> 00:16:41,134
But I did all the maths
and it just seems ridiculous.

276
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:43,592
Mate, you're gonna have to be on a diet

277
00:16:43,692 --> 00:16:45,301
for the rest of the day if
you're only allowed to have

278
00:16:45,401 --> 00:16:47,217
20 teaspoons for the rest of the day.

279
00:16:47,317 --> 00:16:48,551
That's what I mean!

280
00:16:48,651 --> 00:16:50,776
I'll have to eat celery
for the rest of the day.

281
00:16:52,151 --> 00:16:53,817
Just obscene.

282
00:16:55,734 --> 00:16:58,859
When we were still foraging
and hunting and gathering

283
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:02,092
and trying to search for fruit
and things in our environment,

284
00:17:02,192 --> 00:17:05,967
we needed to be highly attuned
to what sweetness there was,

285
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:08,259
because we really need the calories.

286
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:10,509
And of course now we bring with us

287
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:13,467
that ancient lust for sugar,

288
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:16,051
that ability to find even small amounts,

289
00:17:16,151 --> 00:17:18,467
and it's a case where
we were looking for a little

290
00:17:18,567 --> 00:17:20,676
but now we have too much.

291
00:17:20,776 --> 00:17:23,842
And so the system,
in an evolutionary terms,

292
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:26,092
is not really set up to deal with

293
00:17:26,192 --> 00:17:28,984
this sudden abundance
of highly refined sugar.

294
00:17:36,776 --> 00:17:38,859
After just two days of the experiment

295
00:17:38,984 --> 00:17:41,217
I was amazed at how easy it was

296
00:17:41,317 --> 00:17:44,609
to get to 40 teaspoons
without eating any junk food.

297
00:17:46,151 --> 00:17:48,676
I've just had a breakthrough as
to how we might be consuming

298
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,217
so much fructose.

299
00:17:50,317 --> 00:17:52,134
I just bought these four apples.

300
00:17:52,234 --> 00:17:54,717
Now, I know that if I tried
to eat these apples

301
00:17:54,817 --> 00:17:57,509
I'd probably get through
two of them and I'd feel full.

302
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:01,801
The fibre in the fruit
would tell my body to stop,

303
00:18:01,901 --> 00:18:04,176
it's had enough to eat.

304
00:18:04,276 --> 00:18:07,067
But I wanna see what happens if
I can juice these four apples.

305
00:18:17,776 --> 00:18:20,967
Right, so that's four apples.

306
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:24,384
That's the sugar from
four apples in one glass.

307
00:18:24,484 --> 00:18:26,967
Now, one apple is about
four teaspoons of sugar,

308
00:18:27,067 --> 00:18:30,717
so that's 16 teaspoons
of sugar in that glass.

309
00:18:30,817 --> 00:18:33,634
See, nature has given us
this perfect little packet,

310
00:18:33,734 --> 00:18:36,051
and it's got all the nutrients,
the fibre

311
00:18:36,151 --> 00:18:37,634
that tells us when we're full,

312
00:18:37,734 --> 00:18:40,092
and just the right amount
of sugar in this.

313
00:18:40,192 --> 00:18:43,176
But what we do is
we invent a machine like this

314
00:18:43,276 --> 00:18:45,842
which extracts only the sugar

315
00:18:45,942 --> 00:18:48,484
and then we throw everything else away.

316
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:58,967
This high amount of sugar in juice,

317
00:18:59,067 --> 00:19:00,676
and drinks in general,

318
00:19:00,776 --> 00:19:03,984
was certainly the biggest
surprise of the first week.

319
00:19:09,067 --> 00:19:13,009
Beverage tend to really create a rush,

320
00:19:13,109 --> 00:19:15,717
what I kind of call a tsunami effect.

321
00:19:15,817 --> 00:19:19,676
So you basically have
this huge wave of sugar

322
00:19:19,776 --> 00:19:20,967
that gets to your liver.

323
00:19:21,067 --> 00:19:23,067
And that has a lot of consequence.

324
00:19:31,817 --> 00:19:35,759
It was now day 12
and time for my first weigh-in.

325
00:19:35,859 --> 00:19:37,692
Moment of truth.

326
00:19:40,151 --> 00:19:42,967
79.3. Huh?

327
00:19:43,067 --> 00:19:44,967
- I'm about to cry.
- Why?

328
00:19:45,067 --> 00:19:46,301
3.2 kilos.

329
00:19:46,401 --> 00:19:48,217
- In 12 days?
- In 12 days.

330
00:19:48,317 --> 00:19:50,717
And that's without one fizzy drink,

331
00:19:50,817 --> 00:19:52,301
no ice-cream, no chocolate.

332
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:54,301
That is eating healthy food.

333
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:56,217
It's alarming. Alarming, alarming.

334
00:19:56,317 --> 00:19:59,192
Debbie's alarm wasn't about
the amount of weight I had gained...

335
00:20:00,776 --> 00:20:02,634
it was the fact that it was
all around my belly.

336
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:05,967
This is what's known as visceral fat.

337
00:20:06,067 --> 00:20:07,317
I'm having a baby!

338
00:20:09,567 --> 00:20:11,592
Here's a great example of it.

339
00:20:11,692 --> 00:20:15,051
On this person,
the fat comes up as black.

340
00:20:15,151 --> 00:20:17,051
You can see there is
a very small amount of fat

341
00:20:17,151 --> 00:20:21,759
just under the skin, but lots of
visceral fat on the inside,

342
00:20:21,859 --> 00:20:23,234
cramping the organs.

343
00:20:24,442 --> 00:20:25,859
There is a term for this:

344
00:20:36,442 --> 00:20:39,009
We know that with fructose,

345
00:20:39,109 --> 00:20:41,967
you tend to accumulate
more fat in this area.

346
00:20:42,067 --> 00:20:44,509
We don't know why,
but we know, on the other hand,

347
00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:47,759
that when you do accumulate
that fat in this area

348
00:20:47,859 --> 00:20:49,592
you have a lot of metabolic disease

349
00:20:49,692 --> 00:20:51,067
that are associated with this.

350
00:21:00,942 --> 00:21:03,467
On day 15, it occurred to me

351
00:21:03,567 --> 00:21:05,342
what 40 teaspoons of sugar

352
00:21:05,442 --> 00:21:07,051
would actually look like

353
00:21:07,151 --> 00:21:10,026
stripped of its cleverly
marketed packaging.

354
00:21:12,984 --> 00:21:17,259
Today I'm gonna eat 40
actual teaspoons of sugar.

355
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:21,009
Just Right, low-fat yoghurt...
there's 10 teaspoons of sugar.

356
00:21:21,109 --> 00:21:24,859
Here, just a bowl of plain Vita
Brits. So what I'm gonna do...

357
00:21:35,942 --> 00:21:39,276
This now equals that.

358
00:21:48,692 --> 00:21:51,301
It's time for my midmorning snack.

359
00:21:51,401 --> 00:21:54,984
Now, I could have this
amount of frozen yoghurt or...

360
00:21:58,442 --> 00:21:59,567
11.

361
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:08,842
So it's lunch.

362
00:22:08,942 --> 00:22:11,276
I have this delicious
piece of chicken here.

363
00:22:12,442 --> 00:22:14,676
Now, I could add half a packet

364
00:22:14,776 --> 00:22:17,859
of this teriyaki chicken sauce...

365
00:22:17,984 --> 00:22:18,984
or, alternatively...

366
00:22:27,067 --> 00:22:30,467
Now, to wash it down,
I could have one of these

367
00:22:30,567 --> 00:22:32,067
or...

368
00:22:53,234 --> 00:22:54,967
So, it's the midafternoon slump.

369
00:22:55,067 --> 00:22:59,551
Now, as a pick-me-up, I could
have this Go Natural Superfood

370
00:22:59,651 --> 00:23:02,551
Apple Strawberry Cranberry Ripple bar

371
00:23:02,651 --> 00:23:07,734
or I could have this 7-teaspoon
water cracker sugar sandwich.

372
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:23,467
It was at this point

373
00:23:23,567 --> 00:23:25,984
that I thought I'd better
check in with Professor Blood.

374
00:23:27,692 --> 00:23:31,509
The big change is that
the liver function tests

375
00:23:31,609 --> 00:23:34,801
have had an amazing rise
in one of the enzyme levels,

376
00:23:34,901 --> 00:23:36,467
the ALT level.

377
00:23:36,567 --> 00:23:39,676
The ALT is an enzyme in the liver

378
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:41,676
which helps the reactions go out.

379
00:23:41,776 --> 00:23:43,009
If it appears in your blood,

380
00:23:43,109 --> 00:23:44,676
'cause that's where we measured it,

381
00:23:44,776 --> 00:23:48,384
it shows that the liver cells
are releasing their contents...

382
00:23:48,484 --> 00:23:52,842
i.e., they're being damaged or dying.

383
00:23:52,942 --> 00:23:54,717
And so the...

384
00:23:54,817 --> 00:23:56,592
You know, the... It's really...

385
00:23:56,692 --> 00:23:59,467
- My liver cells are dying.
- They are. They are.

386
00:23:59,567 --> 00:24:02,301
It's obviously getting full of fat.

387
00:24:02,401 --> 00:24:03,967
You've got the signs of a fatty liver.

388
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:06,342
And this is really the first time

389
00:24:06,442 --> 00:24:09,634
I've actually seen that it
can be actually developed

390
00:24:09,734 --> 00:24:11,109
in two or three weeks.

391
00:24:12,817 --> 00:24:14,551
Given my liver has turned to fat

392
00:24:14,651 --> 00:24:16,759
after just 18 days,

393
00:24:16,859 --> 00:24:18,634
I think it's time to take a closer look

394
00:24:18,734 --> 00:24:21,109
at what sugar does
once it enters the body.

395
00:24:24,401 --> 00:24:27,009
This is the actor Brenton Thwaites.

396
00:24:27,109 --> 00:24:28,967
He's very kindly volunteered his body

397
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:30,734
for the following demonstration.

398
00:24:37,317 --> 00:24:41,301
After sugar enters the body,
it splits into two parts...

399
00:24:41,401 --> 00:24:44,342
fructose and glucose.

400
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:46,859
Both of which
make their way to the liver.

401
00:24:53,984 --> 00:24:55,384
Now, once in the liver,

402
00:24:55,484 --> 00:24:57,967
the glucose is dealt with efficiently.

403
00:24:58,067 --> 00:25:00,217
It's either used immediately for energy

404
00:25:00,317 --> 00:25:03,467
or it's stored for later,
like a spare battery.

405
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:05,967
But the fructose half of sugar
is very different.

406
00:25:06,067 --> 00:25:08,592
The liver doesn't have a system
to regulate the fructose

407
00:25:08,692 --> 00:25:10,551
because it was so rare in nature,

408
00:25:10,651 --> 00:25:13,634
so it hoovers it out of the bloodstream
whether it needs it or not.

409
00:25:13,734 --> 00:25:17,984
And if all our spare batteries are full,
then it rapidly turns it into fat.

410
00:25:19,442 --> 00:25:23,009
Some of that fat
is gonna stay in the liver

411
00:25:23,109 --> 00:25:26,134
and you're gonna have increased risk

412
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:29,676
for insulin resistance and diabetes.

413
00:25:29,776 --> 00:25:32,859
What also happens is that
this fat in the liver

414
00:25:32,984 --> 00:25:36,176
is then sent out into the
bloodstream as triglycerides,

415
00:25:36,276 --> 00:25:37,967
which can lead to excess weight

416
00:25:38,067 --> 00:25:40,151
plus blocked arteries and heart disease.

417
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:47,967
Now, when we're eating lots of sugar

418
00:25:48,067 --> 00:25:51,092
and other carbohydrates
like bread and pasta,

419
00:25:51,192 --> 00:25:52,609
we're producing lots of glucose.

420
00:25:53,859 --> 00:25:56,342
A hormone called insulin is released,

421
00:25:56,442 --> 00:25:59,759
which is like a key that helps
to open our cells' doors

422
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:01,384
so they can absorb all the glucose,

423
00:26:01,484 --> 00:26:04,151
remove it from the bloodstream
and burn it for energy.

424
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:09,092
The more glucose in the blood,
the more insulin is released.

425
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:11,967
But the key point for us

426
00:26:12,067 --> 00:26:13,842
is that while this insulin
is in the blood

427
00:26:13,942 --> 00:26:15,592
dealing with all the glucose,

428
00:26:15,692 --> 00:26:18,759
it tells our fat cells
to hold on to the fat.

429
00:26:18,859 --> 00:26:22,009
It actually turns off
our fat-burning processes.

430
00:26:22,109 --> 00:26:23,842
So when we're eating lots of sugar,

431
00:26:23,942 --> 00:26:26,592
we're putting fat into our
bodies via the fatty liver.

432
00:26:26,692 --> 00:26:28,259
Plus, because of all the glucose,

433
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:30,217
we maintain the level of insulin,

434
00:26:30,317 --> 00:26:33,009
which tells our fat cells
to hold on to the fat.

435
00:26:33,109 --> 00:26:34,467
We can't burn off fat

436
00:26:34,567 --> 00:26:37,359
when insulin is around
dealing with all the sugar!

437
00:26:39,067 --> 00:26:40,342
This is what may be happening

438
00:26:40,442 --> 00:26:42,109
to a huge number of the population.'

439
00:26:44,276 --> 00:26:46,026
It's highly unlikely
with Brenton, though.

440
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:53,509
The issue that we're talking about

441
00:26:53,609 --> 00:26:55,592
is that there are these chronic diseases

442
00:26:55,692 --> 00:26:58,467
related to obesity and diabetes...

443
00:26:58,567 --> 00:27:00,509
heart disease,

444
00:27:00,609 --> 00:27:04,092
many cancers, gout, hypertension,

445
00:27:04,192 --> 00:27:07,967
high blood pressure,
possibly Alzheimer's disease.

446
00:27:08,067 --> 00:27:11,192
The question is,
would these diseases exist...

447
00:27:12,984 --> 00:27:14,817
if sugar wasn't in the diet?

448
00:27:22,901 --> 00:27:26,759
So, this morning I've woken up
and I feel pretty drained.

449
00:27:26,859 --> 00:27:29,567
I had a chicken dish last night
that was pretty sweet.

450
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:34,842
And I could just tell
that my body feels lethargic

451
00:27:34,942 --> 00:27:38,984
and it's waiting for
its next sugar injection.

452
00:27:40,651 --> 00:27:46,009
So the perfectly named Up&Go

453
00:27:46,109 --> 00:27:47,967
is gonna start my day today.

454
00:27:48,067 --> 00:27:50,526
Banana flavoured with, uh...

455
00:27:52,067 --> 00:27:54,734
about four to five teaspoons of sugar.

456
00:27:56,067 --> 00:27:57,176
It was obvious

457
00:27:57,276 --> 00:27:59,301
that sugar was affecting me physically,

458
00:27:59,401 --> 00:28:00,634
but the real surprise

459
00:28:00,734 --> 00:28:03,176
was the impact it was having
on my moods.

460
00:28:03,276 --> 00:28:05,259
It's amazing, it's so sweet

461
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:07,967
and I can feel my brain responds
to it straightaway.

462
00:28:08,067 --> 00:28:10,301
Like, it tastes delicious.

463
00:28:10,401 --> 00:28:14,676
The thing I've noticed the most
is the mood swings.

464
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:17,634
Big highs when I have the sugar
and I feel super alert

465
00:28:17,734 --> 00:28:19,967
and switched on for about 45 minutes

466
00:28:20,067 --> 00:28:23,467
and then I'll get this feeling
of real lethargy,

467
00:28:23,567 --> 00:28:28,467
I'll feel vague, a bit aloof
until I get that next hit again

468
00:28:28,567 --> 00:28:29,967
and then I'm right to concentrate.

469
00:28:30,067 --> 00:28:32,967
I just noticed the attention is reduced

470
00:28:33,067 --> 00:28:35,467
and he's much more distracted.

471
00:28:35,567 --> 00:28:38,176
- Hm.
- And it's very unlike him.

472
00:28:38,276 --> 00:28:39,467
Very unusual.

473
00:28:39,567 --> 00:28:41,759
What you're describing is absolutely

474
00:28:41,859 --> 00:28:44,467
what the research has shown,

475
00:28:44,567 --> 00:28:47,842
is a high concentration, energy,

476
00:28:47,942 --> 00:28:50,134
followed by a crash.

477
00:28:50,234 --> 00:28:53,092
The brain and body runs on glucose.

478
00:28:53,192 --> 00:28:57,467
If the glucose level is going
constantly up and down,

479
00:28:57,567 --> 00:29:00,301
you know, zinging high and low
and high and low

480
00:29:00,401 --> 00:29:01,759
and back and forth,

481
00:29:01,859 --> 00:29:05,551
then your mental function
is just unstable.

482
00:29:05,651 --> 00:29:08,092
If your glucose level is stable

483
00:29:08,192 --> 00:29:12,217
and not fluctuating,
then you have more clarity.

484
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:14,342
It's almost like the body is

485
00:29:14,442 --> 00:29:16,301
getting used to this new reality
that I've created,

486
00:29:16,401 --> 00:29:19,551
and it gets its burst of energy
from the sugar.

487
00:29:19,651 --> 00:29:21,134
And then when that's not happening,

488
00:29:21,234 --> 00:29:22,801
it's, like, going, "OK, we're ready."

489
00:29:22,901 --> 00:29:25,592
Like, I guess, I used to smoke,
it's a similar feeling.

490
00:29:25,692 --> 00:29:27,676
Tell me a little bit
more about what it's like

491
00:29:27,776 --> 00:29:29,717
when you've just had some sugar

492
00:29:29,817 --> 00:29:31,759
and when you're on the sugar high.

493
00:29:31,859 --> 00:29:33,801
A quite childish thing comes out in me.

494
00:29:33,901 --> 00:29:36,176
I go, "Whoo," and then I'm
full of beans for a while.

495
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:39,092
He can be like that
in day-to-day life, too,

496
00:29:39,192 --> 00:29:41,467
he's really fun and playful,
but the difference is

497
00:29:41,567 --> 00:29:44,467
there's a kind of manic edge
to it that wasn't there before.

498
00:29:44,567 --> 00:29:46,551
It's kind of a bit more like, "Ah'."

499
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:49,967
Now, the manic state
is quite interesting

500
00:29:50,067 --> 00:29:54,176
because it's not the same
as happiness, right?

501
00:29:54,276 --> 00:29:57,342
There's a sort of a sense
of being wired.

502
00:29:57,442 --> 00:30:00,051
It's raining sugar!

503
00:30:00,151 --> 00:30:02,301
So, it's interesting
'cause that's what we do see.

504
00:30:02,401 --> 00:30:04,759
And I'm not suggesting
you've got bipolar disorder

505
00:30:04,859 --> 00:30:09,551
but it's a phenomena that we
see in that particular condition

506
00:30:09,651 --> 00:30:11,842
where there's a very high mood

507
00:30:11,942 --> 00:30:14,276
but it's not actually
a very pleasant mood.

508
00:30:16,442 --> 00:30:20,551
So, Damon, the way that blood
sugar affects your mood,

509
00:30:20,651 --> 00:30:23,859
I like to explain to people with
a really simple diagram.

510
00:30:23,984 --> 00:30:27,301
So, this is your
blood sugar levels here.

511
00:30:27,401 --> 00:30:31,592
This is the point where
your brain is really happy

512
00:30:31,692 --> 00:30:33,634
'cause it's got enough sugar
to keep it going.

513
00:30:33,734 --> 00:30:36,509
It is your most important organ
in the body, in that way.

514
00:30:36,609 --> 00:30:38,634
When you eat something
that's really sugary,

515
00:30:38,734 --> 00:30:41,509
like lollies or fruit juices,
that sort of thing,

516
00:30:41,609 --> 00:30:44,384
your blood sugar will spike
really quickly

517
00:30:44,484 --> 00:30:47,217
and then it will crash down
again really quickly.

518
00:30:47,317 --> 00:30:50,217
The reason it crashes
really quickly is because,

519
00:30:50,317 --> 00:30:53,092
in response to that sugar,
the body releases insulin,

520
00:30:53,192 --> 00:30:55,384
the hormone that takes it into the cells

521
00:30:55,484 --> 00:30:56,801
so it can be used for energy.

522
00:30:56,901 --> 00:30:59,342
So, that big crash though

523
00:30:59,442 --> 00:31:01,467
means that your brain's no longer happy,

524
00:31:01,567 --> 00:31:03,009
so, in response to that,

525
00:31:03,109 --> 00:31:07,051
we get the release of stress
hormones like adrenaline,

526
00:31:07,151 --> 00:31:09,676
which is then signalling the brain

527
00:31:09,776 --> 00:31:14,009
to tell you to eat something
sugary again

528
00:31:14,109 --> 00:31:17,134
so that we can get it back up again.

529
00:31:17,234 --> 00:31:21,176
And so, once again, we get
more insulin and it dips down,

530
00:31:21,276 --> 00:31:25,842
and that's why you get
the fluctuations in your mood,

531
00:31:25,942 --> 00:31:29,509
from that sugar spiking and falling.

532
00:31:29,609 --> 00:31:32,051
And the problem with the adrenaline

533
00:31:32,151 --> 00:31:34,634
is that that can lead to anxiety

534
00:31:34,734 --> 00:31:36,842
and even panic attacks

535
00:31:36,942 --> 00:31:38,651
because of those mood changes.

536
00:31:40,901 --> 00:31:42,092
Given my experience

537
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:44,676
of fluctuating blood sugar levels,

538
00:31:44,776 --> 00:31:46,259
I couldn't help but think of children

539
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:48,467
struggling to learn at school.

540
00:31:48,567 --> 00:31:50,859
Could a diet full of hidden sugar

541
00:31:50,984 --> 00:31:53,176
be contributing to the problem?

542
00:31:53,276 --> 00:31:55,259
This has had a very profound impact

543
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:58,801
on children's behaviour,
on mental illness.

544
00:31:58,901 --> 00:32:01,134
It has exacerbated many different types

545
00:32:01,234 --> 00:32:02,676
of neurological disorders,

546
00:32:02,776 --> 00:32:05,634
but we don't actually name
what the cause is,

547
00:32:05,734 --> 00:32:07,759
which is the sugar that's in the diet.

548
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,467
Sugar Crisp is candy-coated

549
00:32:09,567 --> 00:32:11,717
right down to the last
wheat puff in the box.

550
00:32:11,817 --> 00:32:14,176
- As a cereal it's dandy.
- For snacks it's so handy.

551
00:32:14,276 --> 00:32:15,551
Or eat it like candy.

552
00:32:15,651 --> 00:32:17,234
♪ Post's Sugar Crisp. ♪

553
00:32:28,109 --> 00:32:30,026
Don't laugh. It's for the...
You know why I'm doing it.

554
00:32:43,567 --> 00:32:45,592
The speed at which my high-sugar diet

555
00:32:45,692 --> 00:32:49,592
was affecting me
took us all by surprise.

556
00:32:49,692 --> 00:32:52,384
I was going to have to expand
the scope of the experiment,

557
00:32:52,484 --> 00:32:55,067
and this would take me
out of town for a few days.

558
00:33:01,776 --> 00:33:05,759
In 2002 I spent some time with
an Aboriginal community

559
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:08,192
and was stunned by the amount
of sugar they consumed.

560
00:33:10,192 --> 00:33:11,717
Like so many indigenous cultures

561
00:33:11,817 --> 00:33:13,801
introduced to a Western diet,

562
00:33:13,901 --> 00:33:17,967
their relationship with sugar
seemed particularly destructive.

563
00:33:18,067 --> 00:33:20,342
The Aborigines
have remarkably little sugar

564
00:33:20,442 --> 00:33:22,259
in their diet.

565
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:25,092
Two or three small pieces of candy

566
00:33:25,192 --> 00:33:28,551
would be equal to the sum total
of the amount of sweetness

567
00:33:28,651 --> 00:33:31,567
that an Aborigine would get in one year.

568
00:33:33,317 --> 00:33:34,509
In 2008,

569
00:33:34,609 --> 00:33:37,717
Coca-Cola claimed that
Australia's Northern Territory

570
00:33:37,817 --> 00:33:41,467
was their highest-selling region
per capita in the world.

571
00:33:41,567 --> 00:33:43,092
This was, in large part,

572
00:33:43,192 --> 00:33:46,234
due to the local stores
in the Aboriginal communities.

573
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:53,817
Just 100km from Uluru
is the small town of Amata.

574
00:33:55,859 --> 00:33:58,009
It has always been alcohol-free,

575
00:33:58,109 --> 00:34:02,717
but in 2007 its population
of just under 400 people

576
00:34:02,817 --> 00:34:05,567
consumed 40,000 litres of soft drink.

577
00:34:07,859 --> 00:34:10,984
So one Aboriginal man decided
to do something about it.

578
00:34:12,567 --> 00:34:13,984
His name is John Tregenza.

579
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,092
This is his case, this is his putaru

580
00:34:18,192 --> 00:34:20,301
and this is his nickname.

581
00:34:20,401 --> 00:34:21,301
Why?

582
00:34:21,401 --> 00:34:23,651
'Cause I cut through the bullshit.

583
00:34:25,401 --> 00:34:27,967
When I first come up here, in 1973,

584
00:34:28,067 --> 00:34:29,967
I would estimate that,

585
00:34:30,067 --> 00:34:34,217
say, 10% of the people's diet
came from the store,

586
00:34:34,317 --> 00:34:37,759
and now it's almost 100%.

587
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:39,967
So it was obviously critical
that people's health

588
00:34:40,067 --> 00:34:42,026
depended on what they were
carrying out the store door.

589
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,259
This reliance on the store

590
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:48,467
has been caused by a variety
of environmental changes.

591
00:34:48,567 --> 00:34:51,592
The main one being the
introduction of a foreign grass

592
00:34:51,692 --> 00:34:53,301
that took over the plains

593
00:34:53,401 --> 00:34:55,842
and drove away the native plants
and animals

594
00:34:55,942 --> 00:34:58,067
that had provided bush tucker
for centuries.

595
00:35:00,609 --> 00:35:04,467
Being in Amata, it was hard to
believe that only 40 years ago

596
00:35:04,567 --> 00:35:07,634
these people were living
predominantly off the land.

597
00:35:07,734 --> 00:35:11,051
All our families and old people,

598
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:15,176
all our grandfathers
and great-great-grandparents,

599
00:35:15,276 --> 00:35:18,676
they only eating bush tucker,

600
00:35:18,776 --> 00:35:22,259
like emus, kangaroos, turkey,

601
00:35:22,359 --> 00:35:24,967
wild tomatoes, wild beets.

602
00:35:25,067 --> 00:35:28,092
And they were healthy,

603
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:30,467
no sickness.

604
00:35:30,567 --> 00:35:32,759
And then the white fella
came into Australia,

605
00:35:32,859 --> 00:35:35,009
he bring all the sweet things

606
00:35:35,109 --> 00:35:39,484
like lollies... biscuits, everything.

607
00:35:41,234 --> 00:35:42,134
With stores filling up

608
00:35:42,234 --> 00:35:44,551
with highly profitable sugary items

609
00:35:44,651 --> 00:35:47,967
and the community's health
rapidly declining,

610
00:35:48,067 --> 00:35:51,676
John, his colleagues
and a local health council

611
00:35:51,776 --> 00:35:52,801
established a program

612
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:56,526
to ensure people had access
to fresh, healthy produce.

613
00:35:57,609 --> 00:35:59,609
They called it Mai Wiru

614
00:36:05,776 --> 00:36:07,967
The Mai Wiru quickly went to work.

615
00:36:08,067 --> 00:36:12,592
They removed deep-fryers,
added free cold water fountains

616
00:36:12,692 --> 00:36:15,567
and hired a nutritionist to
educate the community.

617
00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:18,859
For the children, they made music videos

618
00:36:18,984 --> 00:36:20,759
with psychedelic vegetables

619
00:36:20,859 --> 00:36:23,151
and put up these signs
on the store's fridges.

620
00:36:24,692 --> 00:36:26,176
I put this one to the test

621
00:36:26,276 --> 00:36:28,026
and I think they might be
onto something.

622
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:37,634
But, most importantly, the local
people were empowered

623
00:36:37,734 --> 00:36:41,801
and began making their own
decisions about their health.

624
00:36:41,901 --> 00:36:43,967
The community at Amata decided

625
00:36:44,067 --> 00:36:46,551
that they were wanting to reduce
the amount of sugar intake

626
00:36:46,651 --> 00:36:48,526
that they were having
throughout the community.

627
00:37:04,609 --> 00:37:06,467
The first high-sugar item to go

628
00:37:06,567 --> 00:37:08,967
was the black fizzy stuff.

629
00:37:09,067 --> 00:37:10,676
Then they've said, "We don't want Coke,"

630
00:37:10,776 --> 00:37:12,092
so they don't have Coke.

631
00:37:12,192 --> 00:37:15,634
So no-one is upset about it,
it is a decision by the elders.

632
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:18,026
And so we don't have Coke.

633
00:37:19,692 --> 00:37:21,967
Mai Wiru was working

634
00:37:22,067 --> 00:37:24,051
and in a very short time Amata had

635
00:37:24,151 --> 00:37:27,151
the lowest rate of sugar
consumption in the region.

636
00:37:28,442 --> 00:37:30,259
With the level of sugar consumption

637
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:33,967
in other communities I've been
in, it's astronomical.

638
00:37:34,067 --> 00:37:35,217
It is over the top.

639
00:37:35,317 --> 00:37:37,759
I think the Mai Wiru group,

640
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:41,776
in itself, could teach a lot of
the other communities a lot.

641
00:37:45,067 --> 00:37:48,676
But just when everything seemed
to be headed in the right direction,

642
00:37:48,776 --> 00:37:50,984
the government slashed
Mai Wiru's funding.

643
00:37:54,859 --> 00:37:58,134
The organisation is now left
with a skeleton of staff,

644
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,859
the nutritionist was the first to go.

645
00:37:59,984 --> 00:38:01,634
The Pitjantjatjara
Yankunytjatjara people

646
00:38:01,734 --> 00:38:04,301
really feel it
because it was their idea.

647
00:38:04,401 --> 00:38:09,217
Like, they're the ones
who saw the problem,

648
00:38:09,317 --> 00:38:11,217
they're the ones who bury
their own people,

649
00:38:11,317 --> 00:38:13,176
they're the ones who wanted
to make a change

650
00:38:13,276 --> 00:38:16,967
and they've been totally ignored,

651
00:38:17,067 --> 00:38:20,176
overridden and having
funding taken off by

652
00:38:20,276 --> 00:38:22,259
the Federal and State governments

653
00:38:22,359 --> 00:38:24,842
and given to
a non-Aboriginal organisation.

654
00:38:24,942 --> 00:38:26,151
It's really quite outrageous.

655
00:38:29,776 --> 00:38:31,967
The thing that struck me about Amata

656
00:38:32,067 --> 00:38:34,384
is that although Coke is gone,

657
00:38:34,484 --> 00:38:37,342
without a nutritionist to
continue the education

658
00:38:37,442 --> 00:38:40,301
people are still consuming
vast amounts of sugar

659
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,484
in other products.

660
00:38:44,567 --> 00:38:46,859
And their health is suffering
as a consequence.

661
00:39:04,067 --> 00:39:05,342
There's a perception abroad

662
00:39:05,442 --> 00:39:08,342
that the problems
with obesity and diabetes

663
00:39:08,442 --> 00:39:10,676
may be related to alcohol,

664
00:39:10,776 --> 00:39:12,717
but here at Amata it's been
a dry community

665
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:16,301
ever since it was established,
so all of the health problems,

666
00:39:16,401 --> 00:39:18,759
including diabetes and kidney failure,

667
00:39:18,859 --> 00:39:21,151
is all related to the diet.

668
00:39:25,734 --> 00:39:28,801
John offered to
take me to a special place

669
00:39:28,901 --> 00:39:32,109
where the full effects of a
disabled Mai Wiru can be felt.

670
00:39:39,609 --> 00:39:43,051
I've known almost everyone buried here.

671
00:39:43,151 --> 00:39:45,359
I've got family members buried here.

672
00:39:49,192 --> 00:39:53,317
These five graves here
are all people under 40.

673
00:39:54,942 --> 00:39:58,859
That's another young person in there.

674
00:40:01,901 --> 00:40:04,676
A whole group up here
of two sisters and a brother

675
00:40:04,776 --> 00:40:08,067
who all passed away from kidney failure.

676
00:40:09,401 --> 00:40:13,092
Most of these deaths here are premature

677
00:40:13,192 --> 00:40:15,967
and could have been avoided
with correct diet

678
00:40:16,067 --> 00:40:18,259
and access to affordable healthy food.

679
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:20,234
It's a complete tragedy.

680
00:40:34,192 --> 00:40:36,967
After four days in Amata,

681
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:40,092
it occurred to me that
what is happening to my body

682
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:42,009
is perhaps a concentrated version

683
00:40:42,109 --> 00:40:43,592
of what has happened here

684
00:40:43,692 --> 00:40:45,692
and in many other
Indigenous communities.

685
00:40:47,567 --> 00:40:50,092
I'd been sugar-free for a long time

686
00:40:50,192 --> 00:40:53,967
and now, by suddenly subjecting
myself to a high-sugar diet,

687
00:40:54,067 --> 00:40:56,484
the effects have been both rapid
and acute.

688
00:40:59,692 --> 00:41:01,467
If immediate action isn't taken

689
00:41:01,567 --> 00:41:03,051
to restore the positive direction

690
00:41:03,151 --> 00:41:05,509
that Mai Wiru was heading in,

691
00:41:05,609 --> 00:41:08,051
then the oldest living culture on earth

692
00:41:08,151 --> 00:41:10,859
is in great danger of disappearing.

693
00:41:23,234 --> 00:41:24,467
Oh, look at that.'

694
00:41:24,567 --> 00:41:26,484
81.2.

695
00:41:27,817 --> 00:41:29,301
81.2

696
00:41:29,401 --> 00:41:32,134
- OK, so what's that in...
- 1.6 kilos.

697
00:41:32,234 --> 00:41:35,217
So in a month I've put on five.

698
00:41:35,317 --> 00:41:36,717
Something like that.

699
00:41:36,817 --> 00:41:39,634
- 76.
- You started out at 76, yeah.

700
00:41:39,734 --> 00:41:41,109
Over five kilos.

701
00:41:42,567 --> 00:41:45,134
- Oh, my God.
- What?

702
00:41:45,234 --> 00:41:47,676
Hang on, is that a...
Hang on, don't tell me.

703
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:48,817
91.

704
00:41:49,901 --> 00:41:51,551
- 91?!
- 91.

705
00:41:51,651 --> 00:41:54,009
So, OK, 7cm.

706
00:41:54,109 --> 00:41:55,009
7cm.

707
00:41:55,109 --> 00:41:57,634
If I keep going for
the next three or four months

708
00:41:57,734 --> 00:42:00,634
at these levels, would I be
knocking on the door of obesity?

709
00:42:00,734 --> 00:42:03,051
Definitely. You haven't got far to go.

710
00:42:03,151 --> 00:42:05,467
I'm eating a lot more than I would.

711
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:08,717
Um... I'm snacking a lot more
than I would have before.

712
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:11,467
I find it very hard to feel full.

713
00:42:11,567 --> 00:42:15,859
Not surprising because you're
not eating very much good fats

714
00:42:15,984 --> 00:42:17,134
or proteins.

715
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:18,551
It's the fat and the protein

716
00:42:18,651 --> 00:42:20,859
that actually helps us feel fuller.

717
00:42:20,984 --> 00:42:24,051
All the low-fat foods that we've
been told are good for us

718
00:42:24,151 --> 00:42:25,842
and that we should be eating

719
00:42:25,942 --> 00:42:29,134
actually tend to be
higher in sugar anyway,

720
00:42:29,234 --> 00:42:30,342
as you know,

721
00:42:30,442 --> 00:42:33,109
and they're not helping us to feel full.

722
00:42:35,442 --> 00:42:36,592
With the effects of sugar

723
00:42:36,692 --> 00:42:38,801
now clearly taking a toll on me,

724
00:42:38,901 --> 00:42:41,634
and having witnessed
its devastation in Amata...

725
00:42:41,734 --> 00:42:42,634
I'm packing.

726
00:42:42,734 --> 00:42:44,092
I needed to talk to some people

727
00:42:44,192 --> 00:42:46,384
that knew a lot more about
the subject than I did.

728
00:42:46,484 --> 00:42:48,009
Have a look behind you.

729
00:42:48,109 --> 00:42:49,609
It's hanging off my cupboard door.

730
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:51,759
It was time to head to

731
00:42:51,859 --> 00:42:54,467
the cultural capital of convenience,

732
00:42:54,567 --> 00:42:57,384
the mecca of the processed
food and sugar industry,

733
00:42:57,484 --> 00:42:59,176
and the current number-one-ranked

734
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:01,092
world obesity champion...

735
00:43:01,192 --> 00:43:03,009
Look out, America.

736
00:43:03,109 --> 00:43:04,984
Here comes Sugar Daddy.

737
00:43:28,734 --> 00:43:31,301
So, we're here in America.

738
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:33,759
Day one, jet lag.

739
00:43:33,859 --> 00:43:37,817
So I just went in to Jamba Juice
and got me one of these.

740
00:43:39,192 --> 00:43:42,967
139 grams of sugar.

741
00:43:43,067 --> 00:43:44,551
I actually need the calculator for this.

742
00:43:44,651 --> 00:43:46,109
That...

743
00:43:48,401 --> 00:43:52,984
that is 34 teaspoons of sugar...

744
00:43:54,859 --> 00:43:55,759
in that drink.

745
00:43:55,859 --> 00:43:59,484
That is nearly my daily
allowance in this cup.

746
00:44:01,276 --> 00:44:02,859
What a great jet lag cure.

747
00:44:07,067 --> 00:44:09,567
Wow, wow, wow, wow.

748
00:44:12,776 --> 00:44:14,676
Now, if I was to eat
the same amount of sugar

749
00:44:14,776 --> 00:44:16,176
that was in that smoothie

750
00:44:16,276 --> 00:44:19,717
but the sugar was in
its original fruit packaging

751
00:44:19,817 --> 00:44:23,342
I would have to eat four peaches,
nine limes,

752
00:44:23,442 --> 00:44:25,984
30 lemons and 30 strawberries.

753
00:44:27,067 --> 00:44:29,967
This might be fine for a bear
about to go into hibernation,

754
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:32,717
but it can have damaging effects
for a human

755
00:44:32,817 --> 00:44:34,651
who thinks they are making
a healthy choice.

756
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:41,176
One of the interesting conflicts
today is this idea,

757
00:44:41,276 --> 00:44:43,009
pushed by some of our government...

758
00:44:43,109 --> 00:44:44,467
well-meaning government officials,

759
00:44:44,567 --> 00:44:48,217
that if you could just get
Coca-Colas out of McDonald's

760
00:44:48,317 --> 00:44:51,259
and get the kids to drink fruit
smoothies they'd be healthier.

761
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:54,609
And yet the fruit smoothies have
just as much sugar as a Coca-Cola.

762
00:44:58,359 --> 00:45:01,134
The first thing I noticed
with American foods

763
00:45:01,234 --> 00:45:05,609
was how difficult it was gonna
be to stay under 40 teaspoons.

764
00:45:06,734 --> 00:45:09,509
It wasn't just the abundance
of sugar in the food

765
00:45:09,609 --> 00:45:11,592
but also the presence of a sweetener

766
00:45:11,692 --> 00:45:13,484
called high fructose corn syrup.

767
00:45:16,067 --> 00:45:19,217
Its primary delivery system
is soft drink,

768
00:45:19,317 --> 00:45:22,092
which adds roughly
4,000 teaspoons a year

769
00:45:22,192 --> 00:45:23,817
to the diet of each American.

770
00:45:24,942 --> 00:45:26,176
People don't actually realise

771
00:45:26,276 --> 00:45:28,009
that high fructose corn syrup and sugar

772
00:45:28,109 --> 00:45:30,259
are virtually identical.

773
00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:33,551
See, corn refiners back in
the 1980s did their best

774
00:45:33,651 --> 00:45:35,717
to make sure that people didn't equate

775
00:45:35,817 --> 00:45:37,967
high fructose corn syrup with sugar.

776
00:45:38,067 --> 00:45:39,467
Flash forward 20 years later,

777
00:45:39,567 --> 00:45:41,759
people are blaming
high fructose corn syrup

778
00:45:41,859 --> 00:45:43,509
for the obesity epidemic.

779
00:45:43,609 --> 00:45:46,717
And now the corn refiners
are desperately trying to say

780
00:45:46,817 --> 00:45:49,467
that they are sugar,
they're no different,

781
00:45:49,567 --> 00:45:51,759
and the sugar industry's going,
"No, you're not.

782
00:45:51,859 --> 00:45:53,234
"You're entirely different."

783
00:45:58,109 --> 00:46:00,134
With sugar and high fructose corn syrup

784
00:46:00,234 --> 00:46:01,967
now in the spotlight,

785
00:46:02,067 --> 00:46:03,634
I notice that companies are using

786
00:46:03,734 --> 00:46:05,801
a range of seductive names

787
00:46:05,901 --> 00:46:08,151
for other fructose-based sweeteners.

788
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:11,859
Any sugar...

789
00:46:11,984 --> 00:46:15,967
brown sugar, white sugar,
high fructose corn syrup,

790
00:46:16,067 --> 00:46:18,259
fruit juice concentrate
from fruit juice...

791
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:20,484
equal effect on your health.

792
00:46:31,317 --> 00:46:33,717
Not feeling very well at all today.

793
00:46:33,817 --> 00:46:37,467
Nauseous in my stomach
and had a headache all morning.

794
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:39,217
And it's interesting,
'cause we're driving through

795
00:46:39,317 --> 00:46:42,526
rural America now,
we're in North Carolina.

796
00:46:48,442 --> 00:46:52,217
It's so hard to get any kind
of decent food.

797
00:46:52,317 --> 00:46:54,342
There are signs that say 'food exit',

798
00:46:54,442 --> 00:46:56,259
but that food is either McDonald's

799
00:46:56,359 --> 00:46:59,092
or Taco Bell or KFC.

800
00:46:59,192 --> 00:47:00,592
It's impossible.

801
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:04,467
And if you grow up as a kid and this
is your only experience of food

802
00:47:04,567 --> 00:47:06,009
and what food is,

803
00:47:06,109 --> 00:47:09,176
it's little wonder that there's
a massive problem

804
00:47:09,276 --> 00:47:10,692
in this country.

805
00:47:47,567 --> 00:47:49,817
The next stop was
Barbourville, Kentucky.

806
00:47:51,442 --> 00:47:53,859
In the great cola wars of the 1990s,

807
00:47:53,984 --> 00:47:57,051
Pepsi and Coke were
engaged in a fierce battle.

808
00:47:57,151 --> 00:47:59,801
The Pepsi army took a strong foothold

809
00:47:59,901 --> 00:48:02,092
in the state of Kentucky

810
00:48:02,192 --> 00:48:06,134
and their number-one sniper
is the drink Mountain Dew.

811
00:48:06,234 --> 00:48:08,759
In this 1.25-litre bottle

812
00:48:08,859 --> 00:48:11,342
you'll find 37 teaspoons of sugar

813
00:48:11,442 --> 00:48:15,609
and 40% more caffeine than
the same size bottle of Coke.

814
00:48:17,776 --> 00:48:19,717
The people of Kentucky
have understandably had

815
00:48:19,817 --> 00:48:21,859
some problems with their teeth,

816
00:48:21,984 --> 00:48:25,092
and one dentist is doing
something about it.

817
00:48:25,192 --> 00:48:26,859
His name is Edwin Smith.

818
00:48:28,067 --> 00:48:30,467
This is his letterbox,
this is his daughter

819
00:48:30,567 --> 00:48:32,984
and this is him
as a collectable figurine.

820
00:48:34,484 --> 00:48:37,301
Edwin drives around the state
of Kentucky in RVs

821
00:48:37,401 --> 00:48:40,301
he has converted
into mobile dental clinics.

822
00:48:40,401 --> 00:48:43,217
He and his team visit schools,
educate the kids

823
00:48:43,317 --> 00:48:45,717
and treat their teeth.

824
00:48:45,817 --> 00:48:46,801
Early in my practice

825
00:48:46,901 --> 00:48:50,467
I saw these patients who
would have this unusual decay,

826
00:48:50,567 --> 00:48:52,342
brown decay, around the gum line,

827
00:48:52,442 --> 00:48:53,717
usually the front teeth.

828
00:48:53,817 --> 00:48:55,859
Most of these people were
addicted to Mountain Dew,

829
00:48:55,984 --> 00:48:57,342
in particular.

830
00:48:57,442 --> 00:49:00,759
And that's where
we came up with the term

831
00:49:00,859 --> 00:49:01,984
'Mountain Dew mouth'.

832
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:07,509
I've talked to some kids who say
they may drink 10 a day.

833
00:49:07,609 --> 00:49:10,717
They started drinking it so early that
they don't know when they started.

834
00:49:10,817 --> 00:49:12,967
Mountain Dew will tickle your innards

835
00:49:13,067 --> 00:49:15,634
'cause there's a bang in every bottle.

836
00:49:15,734 --> 00:49:17,176
They take the lid off,
they take a drink.

837
00:49:17,276 --> 00:49:20,467
20 minutes or so, it starts to wear off
and they take another drink.

838
00:49:20,567 --> 00:49:23,092
It takes the oral cavity
about 20 minutes

839
00:49:23,192 --> 00:49:25,134
to cleanse itself naturally with saliva,

840
00:49:25,234 --> 00:49:27,759
so if you're taking a drink
every 20 minutes,

841
00:49:27,859 --> 00:49:31,734
it's as though you're bathing
your teeth in this all day long.

842
00:49:37,067 --> 00:49:39,301
What's the youngest kids that you treat?

843
00:49:39,401 --> 00:49:40,759
Sometimes 3-year-olds,

844
00:49:40,859 --> 00:49:43,509
3-, 4-year-olds that have
a lot of tooth decay.

845
00:49:43,609 --> 00:49:48,467
And those are usually what they
call baby bottle tooth decay,

846
00:49:48,567 --> 00:49:51,342
and that's from having juices
in baby bottles.

847
00:49:51,442 --> 00:49:54,859
Sometimes it's from having soft
drinks in the baby bottles, too.

848
00:49:56,234 --> 00:49:58,842
Do you do the majority
of your treatments in Kentucky?

849
00:49:58,942 --> 00:50:00,967
- Yes. Yeah.
- OK.

850
00:50:01,067 --> 00:50:03,342
It's eastern Kentucky,
the Appalachian region,

851
00:50:03,442 --> 00:50:04,342
the mountains.

852
00:50:04,442 --> 00:50:05,859
That's the poorest region in the state.

853
00:50:05,984 --> 00:50:08,009
It's directly related to poverty.

854
00:50:08,109 --> 00:50:09,026
Yep.

855
00:50:19,067 --> 00:50:21,092
It's pretty common
for people around here

856
00:50:21,192 --> 00:50:23,051
to drink a lot of pop.

857
00:50:23,151 --> 00:50:25,134
Mainly it's Mountain Dew and Pepsi.

858
00:50:25,234 --> 00:50:28,759
This is 17-year-old Larry Hammons.

859
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:31,467
He's lived in Kentucky all his life.

860
00:50:31,567 --> 00:50:34,467
This is his tatt,
this is his favourite T-shirt

861
00:50:34,567 --> 00:50:37,151
and these are his teeth.

862
00:50:39,984 --> 00:50:41,859
My 18th birthday's in eight days

863
00:50:41,984 --> 00:50:43,717
and, I mean,

864
00:50:43,817 --> 00:50:46,342
people look down upon me
because of my teeth.

865
00:50:46,442 --> 00:50:49,301
As I was a kid I was never
worried about my teeth

866
00:50:49,401 --> 00:50:51,759
and I would just take a pop
everywhere I went

867
00:50:51,859 --> 00:50:54,009
and I'd always have one in my hand.

868
00:50:54,109 --> 00:50:55,342
And how old do you reckon you were

869
00:50:55,442 --> 00:50:57,467
when you had your first
Mountain Dew, like, how old?

870
00:50:57,567 --> 00:50:59,317
I would probably say two or three.

871
00:51:00,734 --> 00:51:02,967
And how much a day
would you say you have?

872
00:51:03,067 --> 00:51:05,592
I would say at least four
or five bottles.

873
00:51:05,692 --> 00:51:09,717
If it was cans,
I would say at least a 12-pack.

874
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:11,551
12 cans a day.

875
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:14,467
Man, are there people
doing that in this town?

876
00:51:14,567 --> 00:51:15,759
Yeah.

877
00:51:15,859 --> 00:51:17,676
What about... You were talking
about your cousin before.

878
00:51:17,776 --> 00:51:21,842
I would say about six
or seven cans a day,

879
00:51:21,942 --> 00:51:23,984
and he's only three years old.

880
00:51:25,067 --> 00:51:27,592
Wow. And how does he...
Does he drink it from the can?

881
00:51:27,692 --> 00:51:30,484
No, from a bottle.
She puts it in his bottle.

882
00:51:36,401 --> 00:51:38,342
Edwin is meeting Larry today

883
00:51:38,442 --> 00:51:40,467
because he plans to remove
all of his teeth

884
00:51:40,567 --> 00:51:42,359
and replace them with dentures.

885
00:51:44,859 --> 00:51:48,151
He has 26 teeth that
need to be extracted altogether.

886
00:51:49,317 --> 00:51:52,859
I'd like to say that that's
really rare but it's not.

887
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:55,009
- You doing OK, Larry?
- Yeah, pretty good.

888
00:51:55,109 --> 00:51:56,467
- Nervous.
- OK.

889
00:51:56,567 --> 00:51:58,301
Have you got any questions about today?

890
00:51:58,401 --> 00:52:00,467
- Yeah.
- What?

891
00:52:00,567 --> 00:52:02,567
When can we get this started?

892
00:52:12,317 --> 00:52:14,634
Can we get his mom in here? OK.

893
00:52:14,734 --> 00:52:18,151
I don't want no pain for him.
I wish I could take it for him.

894
00:53:34,067 --> 00:53:35,484
You're doing well, mate.

895
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:38,109
Hell no.

896
00:53:39,317 --> 00:53:40,301
You're a brave man.

897
00:53:40,401 --> 00:53:42,859
My blood pressure is saying, "Whoosh."

898
00:53:42,984 --> 00:53:44,217
Yeah.

899
00:53:44,317 --> 00:53:46,676
Well, right now,
Larry doesn't feel numb,

900
00:53:46,776 --> 00:53:49,759
and I think we have a couple of
factors playing a role in that.

901
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:53,842
One is that he's very nervous
and the adrenaline's flowing,

902
00:53:53,942 --> 00:53:57,092
and the other is that he has
infection in there

903
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:58,592
and has had infection for some time,

904
00:53:58,692 --> 00:54:01,817
so the anaesthetic does not
take effect as well.

905
00:54:02,942 --> 00:54:04,467
The condition his teeth are in now

906
00:54:04,567 --> 00:54:06,676
you know he's suffered a lot
before he's even been here,

907
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:09,276
so he knows what pain is.

908
00:54:11,276 --> 00:54:12,759
Due to infection,

909
00:54:12,859 --> 00:54:16,301
no amount of anaesthetic
would work on Larry's gums,

910
00:54:16,401 --> 00:54:18,634
so Edwin has decided to
postpone the procedure

911
00:54:18,734 --> 00:54:19,859
for another day.

912
00:54:23,317 --> 00:54:26,676
When contacted,
Pepsi said that in moderation

913
00:54:26,776 --> 00:54:29,967
Mountain Dew is part of
a healthy, balanced diet.

914
00:54:30,067 --> 00:54:32,634
But I would argue that any drink
with that much sugar

915
00:54:32,734 --> 00:54:33,967
and caffeine in it

916
00:54:34,067 --> 00:54:36,567
is quite difficult to have
in moderation.

917
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:41,676
In fact, despite sitting through
Larry's ordeal,

918
00:54:41,776 --> 00:54:44,134
the biggest shock came
when Larry told me

919
00:54:44,234 --> 00:54:47,984
that he still loved Mountain Dew
and would continue to drink it.

920
00:54:56,359 --> 00:54:59,717
Hi, honey.' Oh, it was an amazing day.

921
00:54:59,817 --> 00:55:02,859
When you think of Amata and now this,

922
00:55:02,984 --> 00:55:05,842
you're seeing the direct effects
of what sugar's doing,

923
00:55:05,942 --> 00:55:07,967
and the companies,
they just don't see it

924
00:55:08,067 --> 00:55:11,301
because they're... they're
worried about making money,

925
00:55:11,401 --> 00:55:14,092
they're not on the ground level
seeing the effects,

926
00:55:14,192 --> 00:55:15,801
and they don't care, really.

927
00:55:15,901 --> 00:55:18,509
And I spoke to the dentist about, like,

928
00:55:18,609 --> 00:55:20,676
what Pepsi have done about it
and stuff, and he said,

929
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:22,592
"Oh, look, they contacted me and said,

930
00:55:22,692 --> 00:55:26,467
"'Look, we really wanna help you out, '"
and, you know, so they've bought an RV,

931
00:55:26,567 --> 00:55:29,259
another car to help with
the kids, but he's, like,

932
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:30,717
"Look, yeah, it's good,"

933
00:55:30,817 --> 00:55:34,509
but they don't really need
an RV, they need education.

934
00:55:34,609 --> 00:55:35,634
But, as he said today...

935
00:55:35,734 --> 00:55:38,009
They need to not drink
Mountain Dew every day.

936
00:55:38,109 --> 00:55:40,009
But, as he said, they're not
gonna educate the kids

937
00:55:40,109 --> 00:55:41,509
'cause that means
they'll stop drinking it,

938
00:55:41,609 --> 00:55:43,234
and that's a disaster for them.

939
00:55:52,817 --> 00:55:54,342
My experience with Larry

940
00:55:54,442 --> 00:55:57,467
led me to a Pulitzer
Prize-winning author

941
00:55:57,567 --> 00:55:59,967
who has written extensively
on how the food giants

942
00:56:00,067 --> 00:56:02,067
have got us hooked on their products.

943
00:56:03,692 --> 00:56:06,551
You can't underestimate

944
00:56:06,651 --> 00:56:09,467
the amount of scientific effort

945
00:56:09,567 --> 00:56:12,842
that these companies will put into

946
00:56:12,942 --> 00:56:16,484
maximising the allure of their products.

947
00:56:17,692 --> 00:56:20,342
Understanding the sort of fundamentals

948
00:56:20,442 --> 00:56:21,759
of how we taste

949
00:56:21,859 --> 00:56:26,967
and why we crave
and what makes food addictive.

950
00:56:27,067 --> 00:56:29,592
I was lucky enough to spend some time

951
00:56:29,692 --> 00:56:32,967
with a legend in
the processed food industry.

952
00:56:33,067 --> 00:56:35,217
His name is Howard Moskowitz.

953
00:56:35,317 --> 00:56:38,509
And he walked me through
his recent creation

954
00:56:38,609 --> 00:56:41,276
of a new soda flavour for Dr Pepper.

955
00:56:42,567 --> 00:56:48,801
He started with 61 levels of
sweeteners in the formulation,

956
00:56:48,901 --> 00:56:51,801
subjected that to more than 3,000

957
00:56:51,901 --> 00:56:54,592
consumer taste tests around the country,

958
00:56:54,692 --> 00:56:56,759
then took that data

959
00:56:56,859 --> 00:57:01,509
and out came the optimum
level of sweetness

960
00:57:01,609 --> 00:57:05,551
that was guaranteed to send
their new soda

961
00:57:05,651 --> 00:57:07,651
flying off the shelf.

962
00:57:16,234 --> 00:57:18,301
Behind the closed doors of industry,

963
00:57:18,401 --> 00:57:20,592
this optimal amount of sugar

964
00:57:20,692 --> 00:57:23,109
is referred to as 'the bliss point'.

965
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:27,842
Back in the 1970s,

966
00:57:27,942 --> 00:57:29,259
Howard Moskowitz discovered

967
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:31,967
that as you increase
the amount of sugar in a product

968
00:57:32,067 --> 00:57:33,967
people liked it more and more.

969
00:57:34,067 --> 00:57:35,467
But then they peaked

970
00:57:35,567 --> 00:57:37,176
and if any more sugar was added

971
00:57:37,276 --> 00:57:38,967
then they stopped liking it.

972
00:57:39,067 --> 00:57:41,176
So I discovered the bliss point,

973
00:57:41,276 --> 00:57:43,176
and that's what it was
christened... the bliss point.

974
00:57:43,276 --> 00:57:48,842
Well, fast forward 45 years
later, it means pasta sauce,

975
00:57:48,942 --> 00:57:52,592
it means sodas, it means cereals.

976
00:57:52,692 --> 00:57:56,467
Creating bliss points in
products all over the place

977
00:57:56,567 --> 00:58:00,067
is exploiting the biology of the child.

978
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:04,092
You know, it's created
this expectation in kids

979
00:58:04,192 --> 00:58:09,467
that everything
they eat should taste sweet,

980
00:58:09,567 --> 00:58:13,092
so when you get to
the vegetable aisle, right,

981
00:58:13,192 --> 00:58:15,967
and you're trying to get little
Mikey to eat that broccoli

982
00:58:16,067 --> 00:58:18,551
and he starts tasting
those bitter notes, right,

983
00:58:18,651 --> 00:58:20,092
instead of sweetness, you know,

984
00:58:20,192 --> 00:58:23,151
you're in for a load of trouble
as a parent.

985
00:58:28,151 --> 00:58:30,301
It's understandable
that our palates have adjusted

986
00:58:30,401 --> 00:58:32,859
to all of these blissed out foods

987
00:58:32,984 --> 00:58:35,984
when we have such
a primal desire for sweet.

988
00:58:37,276 --> 00:58:40,342
Even Mother Nature herself
has created a berry

989
00:58:40,442 --> 00:58:42,359
that makes everything taste sweet.

990
00:58:44,817 --> 00:58:49,009
So, in front of me
I have three food items

991
00:58:49,109 --> 00:58:51,759
that it's fair to say I don't enjoy.

992
00:58:51,859 --> 00:58:56,676
This here piping hot chilli,
this here sour lemon

993
00:58:56,776 --> 00:59:00,359
and this nasty bottle
of apple cider vinegar.

994
00:59:01,567 --> 00:59:03,509
But apparently

995
00:59:03,609 --> 00:59:07,592
if I put this miracle berry
onto my tongue

996
00:59:07,692 --> 00:59:11,092
and then eat those things,

997
00:59:11,192 --> 00:59:14,067
it's supposed to make them taste sweet.

998
00:59:25,651 --> 00:59:27,984
No way!

999
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:31,859
That's an orange.

1000
00:59:34,317 --> 00:59:35,734
I'm dubious.

1001
00:59:44,567 --> 00:59:47,217
When it hit my throat
it was really intense,

1002
00:59:47,317 --> 00:59:49,026
but in the mouth...

1003
00:59:50,567 --> 00:59:51,592
I don't know what it tasted like.

1004
00:59:51,692 --> 00:59:54,384
Maybe, um... lemonade kind of thing.

1005
00:59:54,484 --> 00:59:57,859
Wasn't too sweet,
but it was not apple cider vinegar.

1006
01:00:00,151 --> 01:00:02,467
But this has got me nervous.

1007
01:00:02,567 --> 01:00:05,734
I do not like chilli at all.

1008
01:00:15,067 --> 01:00:16,484
Please work.

1009
01:00:24,109 --> 01:00:25,259
Nothing.

1010
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:28,109
Oh! It's hit my throat, though!

1011
01:00:29,317 --> 01:00:31,609
There's no miracle berry
on my oesophagus.

1012
01:00:33,609 --> 01:00:34,984
Damn.

1013
01:00:36,442 --> 01:00:38,842
This experiment with my tastebuds

1014
01:00:38,942 --> 01:00:42,467
made me realise what the food
companies have always known...

1015
01:00:42,567 --> 01:00:45,676
that adding sweetness
can make anything palatable.

1016
01:00:45,776 --> 01:00:48,176
I'm so sorry.

1017
01:00:48,276 --> 01:00:49,359
Well, almost anything.

1018
01:00:58,067 --> 01:01:01,842
It was now day 35,
and the rule of the experiment

1019
01:01:01,942 --> 01:01:05,817
I was finding increasingly hard
to maintain was exercise.

1020
01:01:06,984 --> 01:01:08,717
My motivation had plummeted.

1021
01:01:08,817 --> 01:01:09,817
My heart hurts.

1022
01:01:24,151 --> 01:01:25,859
Hello, Sharon.

1023
01:01:25,984 --> 01:01:27,359
How are you feeling?

1024
01:01:28,776 --> 01:01:31,967
Well, if you could see
me you would not recognise me,

1025
01:01:32,067 --> 01:01:34,551
'cause there's a few pimples
that have arrived,

1026
01:01:34,651 --> 01:01:37,467
there's a lot of fat
and fullness in my face,

1027
01:01:37,567 --> 01:01:41,842
and my tummy is really
quite something to behold.

1028
01:01:41,942 --> 01:01:44,467
I can't fit into my favourite
new shorts anymore,

1029
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:46,842
which is a bit disappointing.

1030
01:01:46,942 --> 01:01:48,651
When did the pimples break out?

1031
01:01:50,359 --> 01:01:51,859
About three days ago.

1032
01:01:51,984 --> 01:01:57,842
Um... it's probably your liver reacting.

1033
01:01:57,942 --> 01:02:01,634
Often skin conditions are related

1034
01:02:01,734 --> 01:02:04,092
to poor liver functioning.

1035
01:02:04,192 --> 01:02:07,676
So, if someone's on a sort of,
like, high-processed sugar diet,

1036
01:02:07,776 --> 01:02:11,259
you'll see it in their eyes,
you'll see bags under the eyes,

1037
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:12,859
you'll see it in their skin.

1038
01:02:12,984 --> 01:02:17,484
Whether they're here or they're
just really drawn and lethargic.

1039
01:02:21,567 --> 01:02:24,467
Sugar's effects on me
physically were obvious,

1040
01:02:24,567 --> 01:02:28,509
but my cravings for it and
the mental toll it was taking

1041
01:02:28,609 --> 01:02:31,692
prompted me to explore what
it was doing to my brain.

1042
01:02:33,317 --> 01:02:36,734
So I took my pimply face to
the Oregon Research Institute.

1043
01:02:39,109 --> 01:02:42,467
This group of scientists, who
I'm trusting enormously,

1044
01:02:42,567 --> 01:02:45,217
own this colossal
magnetic sucking machine

1045
01:02:45,317 --> 01:02:46,734
called an FMRI...

1046
01:02:47,817 --> 01:02:50,984
which they are going to
put me and my brain into.

1047
01:02:52,067 --> 01:02:54,384
They will then show me
images of this high-sugar,

1048
01:02:54,484 --> 01:02:57,259
low-fat milkshake and
then feed me the milkshake

1049
01:02:57,359 --> 01:02:58,859
through a special megastraw.

1050
01:03:01,151 --> 01:03:03,259
Then they'll take
some photos of my brain

1051
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:04,967
and show me how it reacted.

1052
01:03:05,067 --> 01:03:06,859
Wow.

1053
01:03:13,901 --> 01:03:15,717
Now I'm gonna climb into my own brain

1054
01:03:15,817 --> 01:03:17,859
and see what effects
sugar just had on it.

1055
01:03:29,317 --> 01:03:32,051
Now, the first step is that we
see what's called a cue,

1056
01:03:32,151 --> 01:03:33,967
or a trigger...

1057
01:03:34,067 --> 01:03:36,051
which, in my case, was the milkshake.

1058
01:03:36,151 --> 01:03:39,676
It can be a picture of one
or the real thing.

1059
01:03:39,776 --> 01:03:42,009
Now, when we see this sugary
cue, or trigger,

1060
01:03:42,109 --> 01:03:45,467
a chemical called dopamine
is released in our brain.

1061
01:03:45,567 --> 01:03:48,217
This is an evolutionary urge
when sweetness was rare,

1062
01:03:48,317 --> 01:03:51,134
so when we saw it,
our brain said, "Get that,

1063
01:03:51,234 --> 01:03:53,692
"'cause you need it for quick
energy and to feel good."

1064
01:03:55,151 --> 01:03:58,134
Now, the next step is that
we get the sugary item.

1065
01:03:58,234 --> 01:04:01,692
We bring it to our mouth
and we taste its sweetness.

1066
01:04:02,859 --> 01:04:04,717
It's then that chemicals called opioids

1067
01:04:04,817 --> 01:04:08,192
and beta-endorphins are
released and we feel terrific.

1068
01:04:09,651 --> 01:04:12,217
Sugar loads have the same
reward areas as nicotine,

1069
01:04:12,317 --> 01:04:13,984
cocaine and sex!

1070
01:04:17,067 --> 01:04:19,051
But it doesn't last long.

1071
01:04:19,151 --> 01:04:21,967
Now, if some of us eat
sugary foods often enough

1072
01:04:22,067 --> 01:04:24,759
and establish this happy feeling
of reward,

1073
01:04:24,859 --> 01:04:27,676
it can create subconscious
or mindless habits,

1074
01:04:27,776 --> 01:04:30,984
which are easily triggered by
more images of sugary foods.

1075
01:04:33,942 --> 01:04:35,967
Throw into the mix that
the fructose half of sugar

1076
01:04:36,067 --> 01:04:38,301
also affects our appetite
control centres,

1077
01:04:38,401 --> 01:04:41,342
plus the glucose half affects our moods,

1078
01:04:41,442 --> 01:04:43,592
and suddenly we have
a very volatile combination

1079
01:04:43,692 --> 01:04:44,609
on our hands.

1080
01:04:47,901 --> 01:04:50,259
One of the very interesting
emerging findings

1081
01:04:50,359 --> 01:04:52,467
in this literature is

1082
01:04:52,567 --> 01:04:54,801
the more you eat high-sugar foods,

1083
01:04:54,901 --> 01:04:57,051
the more you're gonna desire
high-sugar foods

1084
01:04:57,151 --> 01:04:58,567
and wanna continue eating them.

1085
01:05:02,692 --> 01:05:06,301
This desire to wanna
keep eating more sugary foods

1086
01:05:06,401 --> 01:05:08,067
sounds a lot like addictive behaviour.

1087
01:05:11,817 --> 01:05:15,842
Serge Ahmed, who's
now in Bordeaux, in France,

1088
01:05:15,942 --> 01:05:20,384
published a really cool study
where he basically showed that

1089
01:05:20,484 --> 01:05:24,259
rats will work harder for sugar
than they will for cocaine.

1090
01:05:24,359 --> 01:05:26,859
Unlike the drug dealer, who's, you know,

1091
01:05:26,984 --> 01:05:29,009
squired away some place hiding,

1092
01:05:29,109 --> 01:05:35,651
the food giants are in your face
everywhere you go.

1093
01:05:37,192 --> 01:05:39,176
In the boardrooms of these food giants,

1094
01:05:39,276 --> 01:05:42,176
'addiction' is a dirty word.

1095
01:05:42,276 --> 01:05:45,217
When it comes to obesity and illness,

1096
01:05:45,317 --> 01:05:47,801
the food industry have always
argued that people need to take

1097
01:05:47,901 --> 01:05:51,134
personal responsibility
for their food choices.

1098
01:05:51,234 --> 01:05:52,801
When it comes to eating,

1099
01:05:52,901 --> 01:05:54,384
fat people are basically very stupid.

1100
01:05:54,484 --> 01:05:56,092
No, but, you see,
I was away this weekend

1101
01:05:56,192 --> 01:05:57,859
and it is difficult in friends' houses.

1102
01:05:57,984 --> 01:06:00,817
OK, Mrs Wright, no more chocolates.

1103
01:06:02,442 --> 01:06:03,967
For more than 50 years,

1104
01:06:04,067 --> 01:06:07,009
the food industry has insisted
that obesity is caused

1105
01:06:07,109 --> 01:06:09,967
by too many calories
and not enough exercise.

1106
01:06:10,067 --> 01:06:13,217
Which implies that anyone overweight

1107
01:06:13,317 --> 01:06:15,567
is simply lazy or greedy.

1108
01:06:18,484 --> 01:06:19,984
OK, so, we just passed halfway.

1109
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:23,692
And I've never counted
calories in my life.

1110
01:06:25,067 --> 01:06:26,967
I'm trying my best in this experiment.

1111
01:06:27,067 --> 01:06:29,467
It's hard to be accurate, obviously.

1112
01:06:29,567 --> 01:06:34,967
But it looks like my calories
so far are pretty much

1113
01:06:35,067 --> 01:06:37,359
exactly the same as they were
pre-experiment.

1114
01:06:38,942 --> 01:06:40,467
And that feels strange because

1115
01:06:40,567 --> 01:06:42,509
I feel like I'm eating a lot more.

1116
01:06:42,609 --> 01:06:44,092
But I can see here that

1117
01:06:44,192 --> 01:06:45,759
when I was eating, pre-experiment,

1118
01:06:45,859 --> 01:06:47,759
avocado and nuts and stuff,

1119
01:06:47,859 --> 01:06:50,467
there's a lot more calories
in fat than there is in sugar.

1120
01:06:50,567 --> 01:06:52,759
So... in fact, it's half.

1121
01:06:52,859 --> 01:06:55,217
Like, nine calories per gram of fat

1122
01:06:55,317 --> 01:06:57,509
whereas sugar's only got four calories,

1123
01:06:57,609 --> 01:07:00,134
so I can see why we're told that
sugar's OK and don't eat fat,

1124
01:07:00,234 --> 01:07:02,051
'cause there's less calories.

1125
01:07:02,151 --> 01:07:05,134
But... I'm eating
the same amount of calories

1126
01:07:05,234 --> 01:07:09,717
as I did before but
my liver's turned to fat,

1127
01:07:09,817 --> 01:07:12,276
my belly's chasing my lady's.

1128
01:07:13,567 --> 01:07:15,859
It's doing something
to my brain, we know that now.

1129
01:07:17,734 --> 01:07:19,109
And I'm not feeling full.

1130
01:07:21,234 --> 01:07:23,634
So it feels like the calories from sugar

1131
01:07:23,734 --> 01:07:26,651
behave very differently
to other calories.

1132
01:07:27,984 --> 01:07:30,967
The sugar industry absolutely
depended on this idea

1133
01:07:31,067 --> 01:07:33,259
that it's just about energy balance.

1134
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:35,859
'Cause if there's something
uniquely deleterious

1135
01:07:35,984 --> 01:07:36,984
about sugar...

1136
01:07:39,276 --> 01:07:41,759
then they're in the realm
that cigarettes are in,

1137
01:07:41,859 --> 01:07:44,051
tobacco and lung cancer.

1138
01:07:44,151 --> 01:07:45,842
But if it's just about eating too much

1139
01:07:45,942 --> 01:07:47,551
or not exercising too little,

1140
01:07:47,651 --> 01:07:49,759
if a calorie of sugar
is no different than

1141
01:07:49,859 --> 01:07:52,842
a calorie of broccoli, they're fine.

1142
01:07:52,942 --> 01:07:55,676
Just tell people to
moderate their weight...

1143
01:07:55,776 --> 01:07:58,301
if you're getting fat, eat less
and that's all there is.

1144
01:07:58,401 --> 01:08:00,967
So the sugar industry also
sort of pushed this idea

1145
01:08:01,067 --> 01:08:03,217
that a calorie is a calorie
is a calorie,

1146
01:08:03,317 --> 01:08:04,676
and yet these calories do

1147
01:08:04,776 --> 01:08:06,801
dramatically different things
in the human body,

1148
01:08:06,901 --> 01:08:08,151
and they always have.

1149
01:08:13,317 --> 01:08:15,092
It's become clear to me

1150
01:08:15,192 --> 01:08:16,967
that in the search for profits,

1151
01:08:17,067 --> 01:08:19,176
the food companies
are not only targeting

1152
01:08:19,276 --> 01:08:21,467
our primal desire for sugar,

1153
01:08:21,567 --> 01:08:25,234
but are also insisting
that all calories are equal.

1154
01:08:26,651 --> 01:08:29,301
The result is that we feel like failures

1155
01:08:29,401 --> 01:08:31,276
if we're addicted or overweight.

1156
01:08:33,567 --> 01:08:36,967
Perhaps the greed that is actually
making us overweight and sick

1157
01:08:37,067 --> 01:08:38,359
is of the corporate variety.

1158
01:08:42,067 --> 01:08:44,676
- Hello, you.
- Hello, honey.

1159
01:08:44,776 --> 01:08:45,967
Can you show me the belly?

1160
01:08:46,067 --> 01:08:49,551
Have a look at this baby. He's
actually doing little kicks.

1161
01:08:49,651 --> 01:08:51,717
Quick.

1162
01:08:51,817 --> 01:08:54,259
Aww.

1163
01:08:54,359 --> 01:08:56,467
Hello, baby.

1164
01:08:56,567 --> 01:08:58,967
Hello, baby.

1165
01:08:59,067 --> 01:09:00,509
Hello, Daddy.

1166
01:09:00,609 --> 01:09:02,467
- Bye.
- Love you.

1167
01:09:02,567 --> 01:09:04,676
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

1168
01:09:04,776 --> 01:09:05,984
- Bye.
- Bye.

1169
01:09:15,776 --> 01:09:18,259
Do you know how many sugarholics
there are in this country?

1170
01:09:18,359 --> 01:09:20,592
Millions and millions of them.

1171
01:09:20,692 --> 01:09:22,217
As you go around the schoolyards,

1172
01:09:22,317 --> 01:09:24,342
you watch the young boys
and girls of this country

1173
01:09:24,442 --> 01:09:25,842
and see how many of these children...

1174
01:09:25,942 --> 01:09:27,759
Their soft, weak muscles
are out of condition,

1175
01:09:27,859 --> 01:09:29,801
they don't have the energy
and vitality they should have.

1176
01:09:29,901 --> 01:09:31,842
They look like sugar, they don't...

1177
01:09:31,942 --> 01:09:33,717
After 45 days,

1178
01:09:33,817 --> 01:09:35,592
it became more and more evident

1179
01:09:35,692 --> 01:09:39,151
that we're just not getting
a clear message about sugar.

1180
01:09:41,067 --> 01:09:44,509
Could the fact that sugar's
global trade is worth $50 billion

1181
01:09:44,609 --> 01:09:46,067
have anything to do with it?

1182
01:09:47,734 --> 01:09:50,009
It turns out that the
suppression of the message

1183
01:09:50,109 --> 01:09:52,009
began in the 1970s

1184
01:09:52,109 --> 01:09:55,717
when the US Government was
reviewing the safety of sugar

1185
01:09:55,817 --> 01:09:57,234
for the first time.

1186
01:09:58,317 --> 01:10:00,967
The Sugar Association
launched a campaign

1187
01:10:01,067 --> 01:10:03,567
to ensure their product wasn't vilified.

1188
01:10:04,651 --> 01:10:06,384
In this case,
what the sugar industry did,

1189
01:10:06,484 --> 01:10:09,176
is they stepped in when the
evidence was ambiguous

1190
01:10:09,276 --> 01:10:10,301
and they said,

1191
01:10:10,401 --> 01:10:13,051
"We're gonna kinda make sure
it's always ambiguous."

1192
01:10:13,151 --> 01:10:17,676
To do this, the Sugar
Association paid scientists,

1193
01:10:17,776 --> 01:10:19,634
hired a PR company

1194
01:10:19,734 --> 01:10:22,526
and released a report with
a press release that read:

1195
01:10:26,651 --> 01:10:31,801
They put out this document
called Sugar in the Diet of Man.

1196
01:10:31,901 --> 01:10:35,134
There was no sign that it was
paid for by the sugar industry.

1197
01:10:35,234 --> 01:10:36,967
It looks like a very official document,

1198
01:10:37,067 --> 01:10:38,801
it's published in a journal.

1199
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:42,317
The sugar industry sends out
25,000 copies.

1200
01:10:43,401 --> 01:10:45,842
This report was then
used by the government

1201
01:10:45,942 --> 01:10:47,609
to determine its findings.

1202
01:10:49,234 --> 01:10:52,984
Sugar was exonerated and the rest
of the world followed suit.

1203
01:10:55,567 --> 01:10:57,592
Jack Tatem, president
of the Sugar Association's

1204
01:10:57,692 --> 01:11:00,592
presenting to his board and he says,

1205
01:11:00,692 --> 01:11:04,592
"Look, there is no conclusive evidence

1206
01:11:04,692 --> 01:11:08,509
"linking sugar
to these chronic diseases.

1207
01:11:08,609 --> 01:11:12,759
"And this is the lifeblood
of our organisation,

1208
01:11:12,859 --> 01:11:15,259
"it's the lifeblood of our product.

1209
01:11:15,359 --> 01:11:19,009
"If anyone ever links sugar to
these diseases, we're dead.

1210
01:11:19,109 --> 01:11:21,151
"So our job, what we have to do...

1211
01:11:22,359 --> 01:11:25,467
"is make sure that
there's no consensus."

1212
01:11:25,567 --> 01:11:26,817
You know.

1213
01:11:33,234 --> 01:11:35,859
This manipulation of evidence

1214
01:11:35,984 --> 01:11:37,801
and deliberate muddying of the waters

1215
01:11:37,901 --> 01:11:39,676
is all sounding very familiar.

1216
01:11:39,776 --> 01:11:42,634
OK, how's about taking a nap?

1217
01:11:42,734 --> 01:11:45,467
Hey, I got a better idea.
Let's take a Winston break.

1218
01:11:45,567 --> 01:11:47,509
That's it! Winston is...

1219
01:11:47,609 --> 01:11:50,967
And, evidently,
it's still going on today.

1220
01:11:51,067 --> 01:11:53,967
If you create a list of the things

1221
01:11:54,067 --> 01:11:57,217
that the tobacco industry did
to stall or to fight off

1222
01:11:57,317 --> 01:12:01,801
public health actions
that would curtail smoking,

1223
01:12:01,901 --> 01:12:04,967
the food companies are doing
every single one.

1224
01:12:05,067 --> 01:12:08,967
Paying scientists to do studies
that favour industry positions,

1225
01:12:09,067 --> 01:12:11,009
paying money to professional
organisations,

1226
01:12:11,109 --> 01:12:14,259
like heart-related and
cancer-related organisations,

1227
01:12:14,359 --> 01:12:17,259
putting out deceptive statements
in the press,

1228
01:12:17,359 --> 01:12:20,759
characterising science that
doesn't work out for industry

1229
01:12:20,859 --> 01:12:22,092
as 'junk science'.

1230
01:12:22,192 --> 01:12:23,759
There's a very long list
of these things.

1231
01:12:23,859 --> 01:12:27,109
The tobacco industry did them all
and the food industry is doing them all.

1232
01:12:30,776 --> 01:12:33,342
Many of the reviews,

1233
01:12:33,442 --> 01:12:35,342
the final review,

1234
01:12:35,442 --> 01:12:38,467
is that there is no evidence

1235
01:12:38,567 --> 01:12:42,217
that sugar is associated
with metabolic disease

1236
01:12:42,317 --> 01:12:44,592
of any kind,

1237
01:12:44,692 --> 01:12:48,484
are funded by the sugar industry.

1238
01:12:51,234 --> 01:12:53,467
Given everything I have learnt so far

1239
01:12:53,567 --> 01:12:54,859
it was hard to believe

1240
01:12:54,984 --> 01:12:57,859
there are still scientists
defending sugar and fructose.

1241
01:12:59,317 --> 01:13:01,026
I was curious to meet one of them.

1242
01:13:02,859 --> 01:13:05,051
I haven't eaten sugar
for nearly three years

1243
01:13:05,151 --> 01:13:07,759
and part of this film is
that I'm, for 60 days,

1244
01:13:07,859 --> 01:13:10,051
eating a very high-fructose sugar diet.

1245
01:13:10,151 --> 01:13:12,859
I thought maybe I'll put on
a little bit of weight,

1246
01:13:12,984 --> 01:13:16,092
I put on six kilos in Australia,
which is 15 pounds.

1247
01:13:16,192 --> 01:13:17,092
Right.

1248
01:13:17,192 --> 01:13:20,967
All hidden sugars...
granola bars, low-fat yoghurt.

1249
01:13:21,067 --> 01:13:22,092
What's happening?

1250
01:13:22,192 --> 01:13:25,259
Well, what I'd say is that
that's a very powerful anecdote

1251
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:26,467
and I think, you know, it's...

1252
01:13:26,567 --> 01:13:28,259
I think that can be true
for a lot of people.

1253
01:13:28,359 --> 01:13:30,176
But I would say that you had
to be careful any time you do

1254
01:13:30,276 --> 01:13:31,801
a high amount of anything.

1255
01:13:31,901 --> 01:13:34,551
I think if I was to put you,
again, on a white bread diet,

1256
01:13:34,651 --> 01:13:37,009
you know, or to put you on
a, you know, potato chip diet

1257
01:13:37,109 --> 01:13:39,384
or French fry diet,
you might have a similar effect.

1258
01:13:39,484 --> 01:13:42,009
I think the issue is
that all of these calories

1259
01:13:42,109 --> 01:13:43,717
really need to be regarded
as discretionary.

1260
01:13:43,817 --> 01:13:47,217
I found John's position on calories

1261
01:13:47,317 --> 01:13:50,051
so similar to the line that
the food industry takes

1262
01:13:50,151 --> 01:13:51,967
that I felt compelled to question

1263
01:13:52,067 --> 01:13:54,092
the source of his research funding.

1264
01:13:54,192 --> 01:13:57,259
Have you ever received any kind
of funding from Coca-Cola?

1265
01:13:57,359 --> 01:13:59,759
You know, I think this is
a really important question,

1266
01:13:59,859 --> 01:14:02,134
and it's very important for me
that I be transparent.

1267
01:14:02,234 --> 01:14:04,801
So we have received
investigator-initiated,

1268
01:14:04,901 --> 01:14:07,176
unrestricted funding from Coca-Cola.

1269
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:09,467
What that means is they had
no say over our questions

1270
01:14:09,567 --> 01:14:11,842
we were asking,
how we conducted the research,

1271
01:14:11,942 --> 01:14:14,092
our analysis, our interpretation
and our data plan.

1272
01:14:14,192 --> 01:14:15,092
It's a red flag...

1273
01:14:15,192 --> 01:14:17,467
For me to hear you even
say that is, like, "Whoa, OK."

1274
01:14:17,567 --> 01:14:22,759
Because this is a company
with 650 beverage products...

1275
01:14:22,859 --> 01:14:24,009
You're right, you're right.

1276
01:14:24,109 --> 01:14:26,551
...that rely on fructose
and sugar, so...

1277
01:14:26,651 --> 01:14:27,967
So what I would say is you're right.

1278
01:14:28,067 --> 01:14:31,759
I mean, we realised this going in
and, I mean, some may view this

1279
01:14:31,859 --> 01:14:33,967
as sort of shaking hands
with the devil, I guess.

1280
01:14:34,067 --> 01:14:35,759
I mean, even though
that's the case, you know,

1281
01:14:35,859 --> 01:14:37,842
we're confident enough in what
we're doing and our protocols

1282
01:14:37,942 --> 01:14:39,634
and we're laying everything bare,

1283
01:14:39,734 --> 01:14:41,467
that we could afford
to engage with them.

1284
01:14:41,567 --> 01:14:43,759
I think that we should not take money

1285
01:14:43,859 --> 01:14:45,676
from the industry directly.

1286
01:14:45,776 --> 01:14:49,551
I think it's just morally wrong
to do that,

1287
01:14:49,651 --> 01:14:52,634
and, you know, money's tough,

1288
01:14:52,734 --> 01:14:56,176
so it's a big dilemma
for researcher, as well.

1289
01:14:56,276 --> 01:15:00,217
But we don't want to taint the answer,

1290
01:15:00,317 --> 01:15:02,026
we want to know the truth.

1291
01:15:04,109 --> 01:15:05,717
Just one week later,

1292
01:15:05,817 --> 01:15:08,717
I saw an ad for a symposium on fructose

1293
01:15:08,817 --> 01:15:10,717
and sweetened beverages.

1294
01:15:10,817 --> 01:15:13,509
It was sponsored by Coca-Cola.

1295
01:15:13,609 --> 01:15:17,801
Their keynote speaker
was Dr John Sievenpiper.

1296
01:15:17,901 --> 01:15:20,676
He spoke about calories
and there being no link between

1297
01:15:20,776 --> 01:15:24,217
fructose and cardiometabolic
diseases in the studies.

1298
01:15:24,317 --> 01:15:26,967
Coke madly tweeted about it

1299
01:15:27,067 --> 01:15:28,717
and then the host asked the audience...

1300
01:15:28,817 --> 01:15:31,259
To maybe put together

1301
01:15:31,359 --> 01:15:33,967
a YouTube video to, you know,

1302
01:15:34,067 --> 01:15:36,301
bring some balance back
to those messages

1303
01:15:36,401 --> 01:15:37,859
that are out there for the public.

1304
01:15:37,984 --> 01:15:39,717
I found this video on YouTube,

1305
01:15:39,817 --> 01:15:42,067
but I'm not sure it's quite
what they had in mind.

1306
01:15:57,776 --> 01:15:59,467
As the US leg of my experiment

1307
01:15:59,567 --> 01:16:01,759
neared its conclusion,

1308
01:16:01,859 --> 01:16:03,259
what really struck me

1309
01:16:03,359 --> 01:16:06,134
is that despite all the effects
sugar is having on us,

1310
01:16:06,234 --> 01:16:09,859
in many ways we've just
adapted to its saturation.

1311
01:16:11,317 --> 01:16:14,467
And I'm just noticing how
incredible the human body

1312
01:16:14,567 --> 01:16:15,592
and the human mind is

1313
01:16:15,692 --> 01:16:18,092
because even though I'm having
40 teaspoons of sugar a day,

1314
01:16:18,192 --> 01:16:21,051
I've adjusted now to this new reality.

1315
01:16:21,151 --> 01:16:23,176
My body just accepts
that this is what I eat,

1316
01:16:23,276 --> 01:16:25,859
and my brain deals with
the moods up and down,

1317
01:16:25,984 --> 01:16:28,467
I just get on with life
and it's fine, I can function.

1318
01:16:28,567 --> 01:16:32,342
But, uh... I'm not nearly
as efficient as I was,

1319
01:16:32,442 --> 01:16:35,151
my fuse is a lot shorter, I'm exhausted.

1320
01:16:36,692 --> 01:16:39,092
And I think that's how a lot
of people live their lives.

1321
01:16:39,192 --> 01:16:41,717
People are up and down all day,
but it's just their reality,

1322
01:16:41,817 --> 01:16:42,717
so they accept it

1323
01:16:42,817 --> 01:16:45,734
and they've never experienced
anything different.

1324
01:16:47,151 --> 01:16:48,342
And I have

1325
01:16:48,442 --> 01:16:50,984
and I'm really excited
to get back to that point.

1326
01:16:55,442 --> 01:16:57,801
If you've always lived this way,

1327
01:16:57,901 --> 01:17:01,526
you have no idea what life can be like.

1328
01:17:02,984 --> 01:17:05,276
It's not part of your
frame of reference.

1329
01:17:11,151 --> 01:17:12,717
Now, a lot of people will say,

1330
01:17:12,817 --> 01:17:14,592
"Well, I eat sugar all the time
and, you know,

1331
01:17:14,692 --> 01:17:16,859
"I'm perfectly fine."

1332
01:17:16,984 --> 01:17:19,051
Well, what they don't understand is that

1333
01:17:19,151 --> 01:17:21,342
they eat sugar all the time

1334
01:17:21,442 --> 01:17:26,776
and they're fuzzy and their
mind is cloudy all the time.

1335
01:17:29,109 --> 01:17:31,759
Sugar has now become so deeply ingrained

1336
01:17:31,859 --> 01:17:34,009
into the fabric of our society

1337
01:17:34,109 --> 01:17:36,759
that some people can't
imagine life without it.

1338
01:17:36,859 --> 01:17:39,467
What say we took away added sugar,

1339
01:17:39,567 --> 01:17:42,009
well, then what are people gonna do

1340
01:17:42,109 --> 01:17:45,467
to get that same feeling in
their life that sugar gave them,

1341
01:17:45,567 --> 01:17:46,967
in terms of their values
and preferences?

1342
01:17:47,067 --> 01:17:50,317
But we forget that
we didn't always live like this.

1343
01:17:51,442 --> 01:17:53,859
Society has changed.

1344
01:17:53,984 --> 01:17:57,842
200 years ago there was not
a society in the world

1345
01:17:57,942 --> 01:18:00,967
when they had a festival that
was basing what they ate

1346
01:18:01,067 --> 01:18:02,984
and what they drank on sugar.

1347
01:18:04,609 --> 01:18:06,859
Today, it has become synonymous

1348
01:18:06,984 --> 01:18:08,359
with any celebration.

1349
01:18:10,442 --> 01:18:12,217
But, more profoundly,

1350
01:18:12,317 --> 01:18:15,234
it is one of the simplest ways
we communicate love.

1351
01:18:17,067 --> 01:18:20,217
I think the reason that sugar has become

1352
01:18:20,317 --> 01:18:24,801
so ingrained is that it
actually evokes love.

1353
01:18:24,901 --> 01:18:29,009
Our brains respond
to the chemical effect

1354
01:18:29,109 --> 01:18:32,009
the same way we respond to love.

1355
01:18:32,109 --> 01:18:35,092
If we're feeling upset, what do we do?

1356
01:18:35,192 --> 01:18:37,551
We have some sugar, "Oh, I feel better."

1357
01:18:37,651 --> 01:18:40,509
If there's not enough sweetness
in our life, not enough love,

1358
01:18:40,609 --> 01:18:42,151
"Oh, I'll just have some chocolate."

1359
01:18:44,776 --> 01:18:47,301
With sugar having
such complex associations

1360
01:18:47,401 --> 01:18:49,717
with our hearts, minds and bodies,

1361
01:18:49,817 --> 01:18:52,859
I wonder if it is having
far greater ramifications

1362
01:18:52,984 --> 01:18:55,026
for the culture than we've considered.

1363
01:19:01,942 --> 01:19:06,509
Rudolf Steiner said that sugar
essentially causes materialism.

1364
01:19:06,609 --> 01:19:11,759
And that development
of the sugar metabolism

1365
01:19:11,859 --> 01:19:13,592
and the sugar drug culture

1366
01:19:13,692 --> 01:19:15,967
developed a materialistic culture.

1367
01:19:16,067 --> 01:19:18,092
We live in a time of instant
gratification,

1368
01:19:18,192 --> 01:19:20,342
nobody wants to wait for anything.

1369
01:19:20,442 --> 01:19:22,734
What's sugar? Quick energy,
it's straight to the brain.

1370
01:19:47,234 --> 01:19:51,259
Eat that pie!
Eat that pie! Eat that pie.'

1371
01:19:51,359 --> 01:19:55,467
Eat that pie! Eat that pie.'
Eat that pie!

1372
01:19:55,567 --> 01:19:59,634
Eat that pie!
Eat that pie! Eat that pie.'

1373
01:19:59,734 --> 01:20:03,859
Eat that pie! Eat that pie.'
Eat that pie!

1374
01:20:15,067 --> 01:20:16,776
Hi, darling.

1375
01:20:18,067 --> 01:20:19,484
Oh, look at this.

1376
01:20:21,067 --> 01:20:24,509
Hello, little dude.
How are you going in there, dudie?

1377
01:20:24,609 --> 01:20:26,384
Massive.

1378
01:20:26,484 --> 01:20:28,176
How big's mine, too? Look at that.

1379
01:20:28,276 --> 01:20:30,592
Oh, my God.

1380
01:20:30,692 --> 01:20:31,692
Alright, let's do it.

1381
01:20:33,776 --> 01:20:35,301
After 60 days

1382
01:20:35,401 --> 01:20:39,176
and 2,360 teaspoons of sugar,

1383
01:20:39,276 --> 01:20:40,859
it was time for the last meal.

1384
01:20:44,276 --> 01:20:47,676
I thought it would be fitting to cram
all the remaining 40 teaspoons

1385
01:20:47,776 --> 01:20:51,151
into items that could be found
in a child's school lunch box.

1386
01:21:06,609 --> 01:21:07,984
Closed!

1387
01:21:10,067 --> 01:21:11,526
Yeah!

1388
01:21:14,067 --> 01:21:15,859
Be gone.

1389
01:21:18,567 --> 01:21:21,759
One week later, after having
all my blood tests done,

1390
01:21:21,859 --> 01:21:25,301
I assembled the team
to hear the final verdict

1391
01:21:25,401 --> 01:21:27,859
on what sugar had done to my body.

1392
01:21:30,234 --> 01:21:32,842
The obvious place to start is the liver.

1393
01:21:32,942 --> 01:21:35,467
A key marker for
determining liver health

1394
01:21:35,567 --> 01:21:38,301
is a hormone called ALT.

1395
01:21:38,401 --> 01:21:40,217
In the first month alone mine jumped

1396
01:21:40,317 --> 01:21:44,717
from 20 below the safety line
to 20 above the safety line.

1397
01:21:44,817 --> 01:21:46,676
So it took you from, say,

1398
01:21:46,776 --> 01:21:50,801
the best 20% of the men
to the worst 10%.

1399
01:21:50,901 --> 01:21:53,092
- In one month.
- In one month.

1400
01:21:53,192 --> 01:21:56,509
Fatty liver is the first step
towards insulin resistance,

1401
01:21:56,609 --> 01:21:59,509
so once you're on an insulin
resistance pathway

1402
01:21:59,609 --> 01:22:01,967
then you're on a pathway
towards type-2 diabetes

1403
01:22:02,067 --> 01:22:04,967
and then, ultimately,
insulin-dependent type-2 diabetes.

1404
01:22:05,067 --> 01:22:06,676
Today in Australia,

1405
01:22:06,776 --> 01:22:09,967
nine people had a limb
amputated to that disease.

1406
01:22:10,067 --> 01:22:13,967
My triglyceride levels,
which is the fat in the blood,

1407
01:22:14,067 --> 01:22:17,551
went from a healthy 0.08 to 1.5.

1408
01:22:17,651 --> 01:22:19,259
So you'd hit the risk point...

1409
01:22:19,359 --> 01:22:20,509
Gee-whiz.

1410
01:22:20,609 --> 01:22:22,009
In two months of healthy eating.

1411
01:22:22,109 --> 01:22:23,009
Of healthy eating.

1412
01:22:23,109 --> 01:22:26,301
High triglycerides
can also indicate a switch

1413
01:22:26,401 --> 01:22:27,967
from healthy cholesterol

1414
01:22:28,067 --> 01:22:31,467
to the damaging small,
dense LDL cholesterol.

1415
01:22:31,567 --> 01:22:34,259
Small, dense LDL
lines you up for heart disease

1416
01:22:34,359 --> 01:22:35,759
because they're the ones
that are embedding

1417
01:22:35,859 --> 01:22:38,467
in the arterial walls,
forming plaques...

1418
01:22:38,567 --> 01:22:41,717
and that's the bit you don't want.

1419
01:22:41,817 --> 01:22:44,676
You can have all the LDL
you like, but don't have those.

1420
01:22:44,776 --> 01:22:49,134
In terms of weight,
I gained 8.5kg overall

1421
01:22:49,234 --> 01:22:51,609
and added 7% to my total body fat.

1422
01:22:52,817 --> 01:22:54,009
But, more ominously,

1423
01:22:54,109 --> 01:22:57,592
increased my waist measurement by 10cm.

1424
01:22:57,692 --> 01:23:00,176
This is the dangerous visceral fat.

1425
01:23:00,276 --> 01:23:03,717
I showed a slight change
in the bum expansion test,

1426
01:23:03,817 --> 01:23:06,051
a variance in the rear flesh wings test

1427
01:23:06,151 --> 01:23:08,384
and had great success
in the highly scientific

1428
01:23:08,484 --> 01:23:11,859
'belly slap, make
a fat wave' wobble test.

1429
01:23:11,984 --> 01:23:13,592
I was quite, as you know, you know,

1430
01:23:13,692 --> 01:23:15,967
quite alarmed that
you were able to do that

1431
01:23:16,067 --> 01:23:17,967
in such a short amount of time, again,

1432
01:23:18,067 --> 01:23:19,842
eating heart-approved, healthy foods

1433
01:23:19,942 --> 01:23:22,134
that everyone's going along
thinking, you know,

1434
01:23:22,234 --> 01:23:23,676
it's totally fine to be doing.

1435
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:26,467
And we're worried about the future

1436
01:23:26,567 --> 01:23:29,092
of this obesity epidemic in Australia,

1437
01:23:29,192 --> 01:23:31,342
whether it's going to lead to
an epidemic

1438
01:23:31,442 --> 01:23:33,259
of liver disease in the long term.

1439
01:23:33,359 --> 01:23:36,842
But perhaps the most
enlightening of my results

1440
01:23:36,942 --> 01:23:39,217
was the calorie count.

1441
01:23:39,317 --> 01:23:41,467
As I'd discovered, my calorie intake

1442
01:23:41,567 --> 01:23:44,067
was virtually the same
as my pre-experiment diet.

1443
01:23:45,192 --> 01:23:48,717
The big difference was
the source of the calories.

1444
01:23:48,817 --> 01:23:50,551
I'd pretty much done a direct swap

1445
01:23:50,651 --> 01:23:53,192
of healthy fats
for sugar-laden products.

1446
01:23:56,234 --> 01:23:58,134
I was looking at
the total calories, as well,

1447
01:23:58,234 --> 01:24:01,092
and very often it would come out as less

1448
01:24:01,192 --> 01:24:03,859
than what he had eaten previously.

1449
01:24:03,984 --> 01:24:07,592
The way that calories have been
measured in the past

1450
01:24:07,692 --> 01:24:09,467
needs to be re-looked at.

1451
01:24:09,567 --> 01:24:12,384
This calorie counting and
this intense fixation with...

1452
01:24:12,484 --> 01:24:14,342
And it's our fault, as much as...

1453
01:24:14,442 --> 01:24:15,676
I take responsibility

1454
01:24:15,776 --> 01:24:18,859
because it's a message we've
been spewing out for the last 30

1455
01:24:18,984 --> 01:24:21,551
or 40 years, but we really have
to try and turn things around.

1456
01:24:21,651 --> 01:24:23,967
And Damon is living evidence,
living proof,

1457
01:24:24,067 --> 01:24:26,801
it is not the calories,
it's the source of the calories.

1458
01:24:26,901 --> 01:24:27,967
It's where they're coming from.

1459
01:24:28,067 --> 01:24:29,967
I'm surprised how quickly

1460
01:24:30,067 --> 01:24:32,342
things went downhill for you,
I honestly am.

1461
01:24:32,442 --> 01:24:35,467
To put on so much
weight in just 60 days,

1462
01:24:35,567 --> 01:24:37,217
without really changing
the number of calories

1463
01:24:37,317 --> 01:24:40,301
you were eating, without,
you know, eating rubbish,

1464
01:24:40,401 --> 01:24:43,634
to have such a big effect...
10cm on the waist,

1465
01:24:43,734 --> 01:24:45,051
8.5 kilos on the body,

1466
01:24:45,151 --> 01:24:47,009
full-blown fatty liver disease
developed,

1467
01:24:47,109 --> 01:24:49,301
well on your way to cirrhosis,

1468
01:24:49,401 --> 01:24:52,592
well on your way to insulin
resistance... that's a disaster.

1469
01:24:52,692 --> 01:24:54,067
Hm.

1470
01:25:11,234 --> 01:25:13,051
You know, I obviously,
through my research,

1471
01:25:13,151 --> 01:25:16,717
have convinced myself that
sugar is almost assuredly

1472
01:25:16,817 --> 01:25:20,051
the problem, the fundamental problem.

1473
01:25:20,151 --> 01:25:21,967
You get rid of sugar

1474
01:25:22,067 --> 01:25:25,192
and everything else becomes
relatively harmless.

1475
01:25:27,109 --> 01:25:30,842
We would like
to do the definitive study,

1476
01:25:30,942 --> 01:25:35,509
but even if we find out
next month it gets funded,

1477
01:25:35,609 --> 01:25:39,009
it's still gonna be five more years

1478
01:25:39,109 --> 01:25:41,759
before I will have results.

1479
01:25:41,859 --> 01:25:47,092
What possible risk
to public health is there

1480
01:25:47,192 --> 01:25:50,567
in people lowering
their sugar consumption?

1481
01:25:53,651 --> 01:25:56,051
This is our problem

1482
01:25:56,151 --> 01:25:59,134
and we should all work together
to solve it instead of pointing fingers

1483
01:25:59,234 --> 01:26:01,301
and not being productive about that.

1484
01:26:01,401 --> 01:26:04,842
And I would love to see the food
industry come to the table

1485
01:26:04,942 --> 01:26:08,526
with scientists and healthcare
providers and do what's right.

1486
01:26:17,109 --> 01:26:20,276
The first week of giving
up sugar wasn't a lot of fun.

1487
01:26:22,109 --> 01:26:25,467
Frankly, it didn't feel that different
from giving up cigarettes.

1488
01:26:25,567 --> 01:26:27,859
I had headaches, I was moody

1489
01:26:27,984 --> 01:26:29,817
and my sleep patterns were terrible.

1490
01:26:31,692 --> 01:26:33,509
And I just tossed and turned all night

1491
01:26:33,609 --> 01:26:36,842
and then woke up very early,

1492
01:26:36,942 --> 01:26:40,692
and as soon as I was awake
I kind of was craving sugar.

1493
01:26:41,776 --> 01:26:44,484
I feel like I need a hit.

1494
01:26:46,567 --> 01:26:48,984
Um... it's the first real sign...

1495
01:26:51,151 --> 01:26:53,067
that this is gonna be a bit tricky.

1496
01:26:54,609 --> 01:26:56,467
But I knew from previous experience

1497
01:26:56,567 --> 01:26:58,592
that I wouldn't feel like this forever

1498
01:26:58,692 --> 01:27:02,176
and that ultimately it would
all be worth it.

1499
01:27:02,276 --> 01:27:04,467
Because food and sugar has

1500
01:27:04,567 --> 01:27:07,301
a very strong emotional component,

1501
01:27:07,401 --> 01:27:09,217
then we have to heal
ourselves emotionally

1502
01:27:09,317 --> 01:27:12,051
and we have to go through what
could be a disturbing experience

1503
01:27:12,151 --> 01:27:15,009
or an uncomfortable or even
awkward experience

1504
01:27:15,109 --> 01:27:16,259
coming off of it.

1505
01:27:16,359 --> 01:27:17,967
But once you get through it,

1506
01:27:18,067 --> 01:27:19,967
which is about two to four weeks,

1507
01:27:20,067 --> 01:27:23,484
suddenly the desire for sugar
disappears altogether.

1508
01:27:25,567 --> 01:27:28,134
One month after finishing
the experiment,

1509
01:27:28,234 --> 01:27:29,484
a miracle occurred.

1510
01:27:32,151 --> 01:27:34,509
Our daughter was born.

1511
01:27:34,609 --> 01:27:37,676
This is her mobile,
this is her teething giraffe

1512
01:27:37,776 --> 01:27:39,342
and this is her lunch.

1513
01:27:39,442 --> 01:27:41,051
- Hiya.
- Are you tired, bubby?

1514
01:27:41,151 --> 01:27:43,192
But then some other
remarkable things happened.

1515
01:27:44,776 --> 01:27:46,609
After just two months
of cutting out sugar...

1516
01:27:47,734 --> 01:27:50,967
my vitality had returned,
my skin was brighter

1517
01:27:51,067 --> 01:27:53,609
and, thankfully,
my moods had evened out.

1518
01:27:55,151 --> 01:27:57,967
I've had hundreds and hundreds of people

1519
01:27:58,067 --> 01:28:01,842
go off sugar just for the reason
of clearing up their mind,

1520
01:28:01,942 --> 01:28:05,717
and typically,
the result I get is, "Wow!

1521
01:28:05,817 --> 01:28:07,692
"I had no idea!"

1522
01:28:09,359 --> 01:28:11,134
In terms of my weight,

1523
01:28:11,234 --> 01:28:14,609
all I did is return to
my pre-experiment diet.

1524
01:28:15,817 --> 01:28:18,301
I swapped cereal and low-fat yoghurt

1525
01:28:18,401 --> 01:28:20,984
for bacon, eggs
and avocado without toast.

1526
01:28:22,359 --> 01:28:25,717
I snacked on nuts and cheese
instead of muesli bars,

1527
01:28:25,817 --> 01:28:29,259
and ate fish or meat
with the fat left on

1528
01:28:29,359 --> 01:28:31,026
and lots of green vegetables
for dinners.

1529
01:28:32,734 --> 01:28:35,484
I lost 6kg with minimal exercise.

1530
01:28:36,901 --> 01:28:41,467
Once you remove that hormone
disrupter, fructose,

1531
01:28:41,567 --> 01:28:44,051
from your diet,

1532
01:28:44,151 --> 01:28:47,484
your appetite control works
again and your weight drops.

1533
01:28:49,359 --> 01:28:52,051
Because I replaced sugar
with healthy fats,

1534
01:28:52,151 --> 01:28:54,776
I felt full again
and didn't have to eat as much.

1535
01:28:55,942 --> 01:28:58,842
Consequently, I spent the same
amount on shopping

1536
01:28:58,942 --> 01:29:01,551
as I had during the experiment.

1537
01:29:01,651 --> 01:29:03,176
Whenever you walk into a supermarket,

1538
01:29:03,276 --> 01:29:05,634
make an immediate right turn
or left turn

1539
01:29:05,734 --> 01:29:09,301
for the produce aisle and avoid
everything in the middle.

1540
01:29:09,401 --> 01:29:12,859
Everything in the middle is
a huge amount of calories

1541
01:29:12,984 --> 01:29:15,092
with very little nutrients.

1542
01:29:15,192 --> 01:29:16,609
And what we wanna do is reverse that.

1543
01:29:18,359 --> 01:29:21,759
But the biggest surprise
was that all of my blood tests had

1544
01:29:21,859 --> 01:29:23,967
returned to normal,

1545
01:29:24,067 --> 01:29:26,984
so no more heart disease risks
and no more fatty liver.

1546
01:29:28,901 --> 01:29:32,092
I think the most
important message is that

1547
01:29:32,192 --> 01:29:35,967
this is not you get
a fatty liver and that's it,

1548
01:29:36,067 --> 01:29:37,301
it will stay fatty,

1549
01:29:37,401 --> 01:29:41,342
it actually can be reversed very easily

1550
01:29:41,442 --> 01:29:44,342
by taking away the fructose
from your diet,

1551
01:29:44,442 --> 01:29:46,217
taking away all those drinks.

1552
01:29:46,317 --> 01:29:49,967
I mean, water is a good drink.

1553
01:29:50,067 --> 01:29:51,509
Yeah.

1554
01:29:51,609 --> 01:29:54,342
In truth, it did take
a while for my palate

1555
01:29:54,442 --> 01:29:56,967
to readjust to my lady's
unsweetened cooking.

1556
01:29:57,067 --> 01:30:00,676
Things tasted bland
for the first few weeks,

1557
01:30:00,776 --> 01:30:04,051
but then I rediscovered the full
flavours of fresh produce.

1558
01:30:04,151 --> 01:30:05,051
Mmm.

1559
01:30:05,151 --> 01:30:09,051
For just five days,
I want you to discontinue,

1560
01:30:09,151 --> 01:30:13,009
or take out of your diet, for five days,
these foods that I'm gonna show you,

1561
01:30:13,109 --> 01:30:16,134
and I promise you that
you will feel 100% better.

1562
01:30:16,234 --> 01:30:18,967
Will you please try this for me,
just as an experiment?

1563
01:30:19,067 --> 01:30:21,276
'Cause I'm here trying to help
you help yourself a little bit.

1564
01:30:24,984 --> 01:30:26,467
In the USA,

1565
01:30:26,567 --> 01:30:28,509
it was recently recommended
for men to have

1566
01:30:28,609 --> 01:30:31,859
no more than nine teaspoons
of sugar a day

1567
01:30:31,984 --> 01:30:34,859
and women no more than six.

1568
01:30:34,984 --> 01:30:37,859
Australia currently doesn't have
an equivalent recommendation.

1569
01:30:39,151 --> 01:30:40,859
I love chocolate.

1570
01:30:40,984 --> 01:30:43,467
I eat a little piece
of chocolate every day.

1571
01:30:43,567 --> 01:30:47,009
But I'm careful and I understand
the adverse effects

1572
01:30:47,109 --> 01:30:48,526
if I have too much of it.

1573
01:30:50,067 --> 01:30:54,051
But for me it's simpler
to cut out sugar altogether.

1574
01:30:54,151 --> 01:30:56,801
And that means avoiding
artificial sweeteners, too,

1575
01:30:56,901 --> 01:30:58,276
that keep the cravings alive.

1576
01:30:59,984 --> 01:31:04,467
If you continue to reinforce

1577
01:31:04,567 --> 01:31:07,859
it has to be sweet
in order for it to be good,

1578
01:31:07,984 --> 01:31:09,342
then you're never really learning

1579
01:31:09,442 --> 01:31:11,301
how to do food... good food.

1580
01:31:11,401 --> 01:31:14,734
I want my daughter to
grow up healthy and happy...

1581
01:31:16,067 --> 01:31:18,842
and not waste any of her
precious time counting calories

1582
01:31:18,942 --> 01:31:20,484
or obsessing over weight.

1583
01:31:25,567 --> 01:31:27,342
By educating our children,

1584
01:31:27,442 --> 01:31:29,467
perhaps they can avoid the mistakes

1585
01:31:29,567 --> 01:31:31,109
that our generation has made.

1586
01:31:33,692 --> 01:31:37,759
Do whatever you can
to turn fruit and vegetable

1587
01:31:37,859 --> 01:31:41,551
into the highlight of your meal.

1588
01:31:41,651 --> 01:31:43,692
Train your kids to love them.

1589
01:31:45,317 --> 01:31:47,217
That's what every
parent's got to figure out.

1590
01:31:47,317 --> 01:31:50,176
How do you get in all those
great nutrients?

1591
01:31:50,276 --> 01:31:52,967
How do you get those
superfoods into your child

1592
01:31:53,067 --> 01:31:56,009
and make it taste good at the same time

1593
01:31:56,109 --> 01:31:57,801
without spiking their blood sugar

1594
01:31:57,901 --> 01:32:02,676
so that they can sit down
and study and learn

1595
01:32:02,776 --> 01:32:05,817
and allow for the creation of genius.

1596
01:32:20,609 --> 01:32:23,592
That's why we're having
the sugar experiment.

1597
01:32:23,692 --> 01:32:26,467
We had to learn that this is not
the right way to go

1598
01:32:26,567 --> 01:32:30,609
in order to help inspire us
to get to the next level.

1599
01:32:32,359 --> 01:32:34,967
I certainly don't think
that sugar is solely to blame

1600
01:32:35,067 --> 01:32:37,217
for all own current health problems,

1601
01:32:37,317 --> 01:32:40,301
but given its prevalence
in our food supply,

1602
01:32:40,401 --> 01:32:43,801
lowering our consumption
is a great place to start.

1603
01:32:43,901 --> 01:32:48,134
Sugar's not evil,
but life is so much better...

1604
01:32:48,234 --> 01:32:50,692
when you get rid of it.

1605
01:32:54,734 --> 01:32:57,842
This experiment has proven
to me that refined sugar

1606
01:32:57,942 --> 01:33:01,859
and excess fructose are causing
serious damage to the health

1607
01:33:01,984 --> 01:33:03,984
and wellbeing of millions of people.

1608
01:33:05,067 --> 01:33:06,509
And as the debate heats up

1609
01:33:06,609 --> 01:33:08,342
and the food industry fight
tooth and nail

1610
01:33:08,442 --> 01:33:10,551
to shut the message down,

1611
01:33:10,651 --> 01:33:13,609
we'll be bombarded with
conflicting nutritional advice.

1612
01:33:15,067 --> 01:33:18,967
But for me, quite simply,
the proof is in the pudding.

1613
01:33:19,067 --> 01:33:21,317
About 10 teaspoons of it.

1614
