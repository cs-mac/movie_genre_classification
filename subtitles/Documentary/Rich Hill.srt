00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:50,440
FBLA members,

2
00:01:50,441 --> 00:01:52,877
Drop, Lock, and Bake will be
this Saturday

3
00:01:52,878 --> 00:01:54,845
at Food Fair.

4
00:01:54,846 --> 00:01:57,382
Please remember to have
your three baked goods,

5
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:59,951
the signup sheet is on
Miss Eld's door.

6
00:01:59,952 --> 00:02:02,954
Have a great day.

7
00:02:02,955 --> 00:02:04,722
Let's win!

8
00:02:04,723 --> 00:02:06,824
Let's go, let's win!

9
00:02:06,825 --> 00:02:08,927
Let's go!

10
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:10,829
Let's fight!

11
00:02:36,788 --> 00:02:39,791
People around town,

12
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:42,760
they walk towards us
or walk past us

13
00:02:42,761 --> 00:02:45,129
with their nose
fifty miles in the air

14
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,598
acting like their shit
don't stink.

15
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,969
And acting like
they're better than us.

16
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,607
And I don't fall for that.

17
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:58,910
We're not trash.

18
00:02:58,911 --> 00:03:01,180
We're good people.

19
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:06,451
Anything could trigger me.

20
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:09,120
The smallest slightest thing

21
00:03:09,121 --> 00:03:11,222
you'd think wouldn't
trigger most people

22
00:03:11,223 --> 00:03:13,224
will trigger me.

23
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:25,203
I think people expect me
to do good things

24
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:29,277
and have a better future
than I do right now.

25
00:03:32,277 --> 00:03:34,479
I don't even know
what to do anymore.

26
00:04:20,892 --> 00:04:24,929
Origin in childhood,

27
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,231
A's by love of parents,

28
00:04:27,232 --> 00:04:30,201
family ties are treasured things

29
00:04:30,202 --> 00:04:34,806
and far through we may,

30
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:37,174
um, youth?

31
00:04:37,175 --> 00:04:38,409
Something?

32
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:42,746
Be tender, but our bonds
with those we love

33
00:04:42,747 --> 00:04:46,019
still pull our hearts
toward home.

34
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,986
Yeah, I think someone
just wrote that on there

35
00:04:48,987 --> 00:04:52,259
'cause they didn't know
how to spell.

36
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:56,927
No.

37
00:04:56,928 --> 00:04:59,629
See, they didn't know
how to spell.

38
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:04,701
See, look, see,
leaven or "yoth",

39
00:05:04,702 --> 00:05:05,869
"you oath."

40
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,604
Remain youth, wait.

41
00:05:07,605 --> 00:05:11,943
And family heir and elicit.

42
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:16,614
Stop it!

43
00:05:16,615 --> 00:05:17,782
You're gonna make me fall,

44
00:05:17,783 --> 00:05:20,519
I'm gonna pop your back.

45
00:05:25,156 --> 00:05:28,359
We lived in Rich Hill
then we moved to Branson

46
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,629
then to Ridgedale,
back to Rich Hill

47
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,929
then to Belton, wasn't it?

48
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,165
Mhmm.

49
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:37,835
And moved again
from Belton to Granby then...

50
00:05:37,836 --> 00:05:39,035
Don't forget Lathrop.

51
00:05:39,036 --> 00:05:40,037
I know.

52
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:43,907
And then from Granby to Raymore,

53
00:05:43,908 --> 00:05:46,376
then to Lathrop,
then back to Raymore,

54
00:05:46,377 --> 00:05:49,814
and then to Appleton City,
back here,

55
00:05:49,815 --> 00:05:51,816
then moved again, well,
in the same town,

56
00:05:52,016 --> 00:05:54,184
but, yeah.

57
00:05:54,185 --> 00:05:57,054
Oh, wait, I forgot
to mention that land.

58
00:05:57,055 --> 00:05:57,590
The Ozarks.

59
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:58,955
Yeah, the Ozarks.

60
00:05:58,956 --> 00:06:01,191
Oh, and then we moved
to Margie's for a week.

61
00:06:01,192 --> 00:06:05,263
Oh, yeah.

62
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:07,265
Are you a little baby?

63
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:08,433
You're not doing it right.

64
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:10,234
It's like, are you,
I can't do it.

65
00:06:10,235 --> 00:06:12,503
Are you a little baby?

66
00:06:12,504 --> 00:06:14,205
Are you a little baby?

67
00:06:14,206 --> 00:06:16,907
He's like, "Yeah, I think I am".

68
00:06:16,908 --> 00:06:17,975
Mom.

69
00:06:17,976 --> 00:06:20,378
Are you a little titty baby?

70
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:22,847
No, you didn't do it right!

71
00:06:22,848 --> 00:06:25,148
Are you a little titty baby?

72
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:29,220
No.

73
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:31,455
Okay, the first line,
"if I die young" sounds

74
00:06:31,456 --> 00:06:33,758
pretty bad, okay?

75
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,359
Okay.

76
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,626
♪ If I die young ♪

77
00:06:36,627 --> 00:06:38,162
♪ Bury me inside ♪

78
00:06:38,163 --> 00:06:42,066
♪ Lay me down
on a bed of roses ♪

79
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:45,436

80
00:06:45,437 --> 00:06:48,071
♪ Send me away with the water ♪

81
00:06:48,072 --> 00:06:51,245
♪ Sing our song ♪

82
00:06:52,859 --> 00:06:54,544
My mom, she wants to
get out here

83
00:06:54,545 --> 00:06:56,446
and do things with us,
but she can't

84
00:06:56,447 --> 00:06:59,049
'cause of her problems.

85
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:02,720
And, I mean, I miss her.

86
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:05,056
I wish that she, you know,

87
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:09,727
could actually do
the things that she wanted.

88
00:07:09,728 --> 00:07:11,395
That's sweet.

89
00:07:11,396 --> 00:07:15,398
I mean, my dad,
he's almost the same way,

90
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:19,537
but he just ignores it
and goes on with his day.

91
00:07:19,538 --> 00:07:22,172
And, I mean, I know
I wouldn't be able

92
00:07:22,173 --> 00:07:25,342
to live without
my parents, so far.

93
00:07:25,343 --> 00:07:27,210
I'm still their little baby,

94
00:07:27,211 --> 00:07:28,479
their little angel or whatever

95
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,614
they wanna call it.

96
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:32,516
That's right, you two
are my babies.

97
00:07:32,517 --> 00:07:33,517
Yeah.

98
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:36,854
I really do love my mom
and my dad

99
00:07:36,855 --> 00:07:38,490
and my sister.

100
00:08:47,869 --> 00:08:49,659
The important thing
about Appachey,

101
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,296
it's not really a poem,
it's just a biography,

102
00:08:52,297 --> 00:08:53,564
the important thing
about Appachey

103
00:08:53,565 --> 00:08:55,199
is he loves to skate,
he's competitive

104
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,933
and he likes to skate.

105
00:08:56,934 --> 00:08:59,070
He's competitive, cool,
he likes to skate,

106
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:00,137
hang out and play ball.

107
00:09:00,138 --> 00:09:02,239
He loves animals,
especially turtles

108
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,341
and he loves his boards
because every one of them

109
00:09:04,342 --> 00:09:06,643
has a story of how he got them.

110
00:09:06,644 --> 00:09:07,813
The important thing
about Appachey is that

111
00:09:08,013 --> 00:09:11,415
he loves to skate.

112
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:15,085
Stupid ass assignment.

113
00:09:15,086 --> 00:09:18,562
Don't know what the fuck
that is.

114
00:09:23,562 --> 00:09:28,365
My dad left when I was six.

115
00:09:28,366 --> 00:09:30,605
Just walked out.

116
00:09:34,605 --> 00:09:37,807
Didn't even say bye.

117
00:09:37,808 --> 00:09:40,682
I woke up in the middle
of the night and he was gone.

118
00:09:44,682 --> 00:09:47,490
He never came back.

119
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:55,326
Get up.

120
00:09:55,327 --> 00:09:58,397
This is what happens
when Mom goes to work.

121
00:10:05,537 --> 00:10:09,306
You are so lucky you did not
hit me with that.

122
00:10:09,307 --> 00:10:11,108
Your cuteness have reached
its limit for the day,

123
00:10:11,109 --> 00:10:14,478
knock it off.

124
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:18,717
AD/HD, bipolar, OCD, ODD.

125
00:10:19,717 --> 00:10:22,452
That's all of them.

126
00:10:22,453 --> 00:10:24,922
I think.

127
00:10:24,923 --> 00:10:28,459
Now they're looking in
to see if he has Aspergers.

128
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,393
And he's not compliant
with medication,

129
00:10:30,394 --> 00:10:33,431
so I don't know if medication
would actually help him or not

130
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:36,566
'cause he doesn't take it right.

131
00:10:36,567 --> 00:10:38,302
And at 13 years old I'm not
gonna hold him down

132
00:10:38,303 --> 00:10:39,836
and shove it down his throat.

133
00:10:39,837 --> 00:10:41,338
It's a choice if he
wants help or not,

134
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:44,109
it's all up to him.

135
00:11:30,688 --> 00:11:33,791
Oh, reading Patrick
a bedtime story, I see.

136
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:35,477
"Snail Tales",
that's a good one.

137
00:11:36,027 --> 00:11:37,862
"Snail Tales"?

138
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:41,132
I thought it was called
now, now, now.

139
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:44,234
It's "Kung Fu Panda:
Legends of Awesomeness"

140
00:11:44,235 --> 00:11:46,808
up next on Nick.

141
00:11:50,808 --> 00:11:54,149
I bet my hair's
all poofed up, ain't it?

142
00:11:57,905 --> 00:12:00,484
I use a lot of water
so you might wanna stand back

143
00:12:00,485 --> 00:12:03,970
with your equipment.

144
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:30,114
I'm very easy to make mad.

145
00:12:30,115 --> 00:12:34,218
Actually, that one there.

146
00:12:34,219 --> 00:12:36,821
I don't have
something like that.

147
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:40,691
That one's $14.

148
00:12:40,692 --> 00:12:42,426
I take pills for it now.

149
00:12:42,427 --> 00:12:44,662
Ten bucks, it's nice.

150
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:46,729
But like, I'll be
fighting with somebody,

151
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:49,899
next minute I don't even know
what I'm fighting about.

152
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,268
I'm pretty sure
I don't got no money.

153
00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:53,537
How old are you?

154
00:12:53,538 --> 00:12:54,738
I'm 15.

155
00:12:54,739 --> 00:12:57,307
Yeah, I couldn't sell it
unless you're 18.

156
00:12:57,308 --> 00:13:01,278
Have to be someone 18 buy it.

157
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,080
I had money in here
the other day.

158
00:13:03,081 --> 00:13:05,749
I must have spent it
on Burger King or something

159
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,319
'cause I remember
eating Burger King.

160
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,270
You have to borrow some money
from somebody.

161
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:30,407
Right now my mom's in prison.

162
00:13:30,408 --> 00:13:33,580
She's been in since July so...

163
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,715
July, August, September,
October, November, December,

164
00:13:38,716 --> 00:13:40,651
January, February, March,

165
00:13:40,652 --> 00:13:43,821
so about nine months.

166
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,689
Yeah.

167
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:48,359
Mom's not with it, I had the
rest of my teeth pulled today.

168
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,527
You had the rest
of your teeth pulled?

169
00:13:50,528 --> 00:13:51,427
Yeah.

170
00:13:51,428 --> 00:13:52,963
And how many was that?

171
00:13:52,964 --> 00:13:54,098
Eight.

172
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:55,798
Now it hurts really bad.

173
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:58,234
Yup, I won't be getting
my teeth pulled.

174
00:13:58,235 --> 00:14:00,870
Just hang it to, just hang it
to a door

175
00:14:00,871 --> 00:14:04,173
and have somebody else
pull on the other end.

176
00:14:04,174 --> 00:14:06,609
Negative.

177
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,811
I'm being recorded
and you're being recorded.

178
00:14:08,812 --> 00:14:10,247
You know how I'm being recorded?

179
00:14:10,248 --> 00:14:13,082
Because every call you make
I'm recorded on.

180
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:16,355
But this time you're
being recorded by my people.

181
00:14:18,355 --> 00:14:21,292
I love you.

182
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:24,994
I love you, too.

183
00:14:24,995 --> 00:14:26,497
Have sweet dreams.

184
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:27,330
You, too.

185
00:14:27,331 --> 00:14:29,832
- Bye.
- Bye.

186
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:30,566
The caller has hung up.

187
00:14:30,567 --> 00:14:31,869
Okay.

188
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:34,872
I always gotta wait for
"the caller has hung up."

189
00:14:34,873 --> 00:14:38,508
That way I know she has hung up.

190
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:42,025
But, yup, that's what it's like
talking to my mom.

191
00:14:55,025 --> 00:14:58,128
I work with my dad.

192
00:14:58,129 --> 00:15:02,269
I make 20 bucks a day
whenever I work a full day.

193
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:07,474
He does oddball jobs and stuff.

194
00:15:09,474 --> 00:15:13,177
Right here is the garden
we've been working on.

195
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:16,113
And, I mean,

196
00:15:16,114 --> 00:15:20,418
it's still a work in progress,
everything is, basically.

197
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:32,630
♪ Hear that lonesome
whippoorwill ♪

198
00:15:33,664 --> 00:15:37,634
♪ It sounds too blue to fly ♪

199
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:43,072
♪ The midnight train ♪

200
00:15:43,073 --> 00:15:46,276
♪ Is whining low ♪

201
00:15:46,277 --> 00:15:51,857
♪ I'm so lonesome I could cry ♪

202
00:15:59,857 --> 00:16:03,765
Pretty much just
dumping the water in it.

203
00:16:07,765 --> 00:16:09,733
But just can't bump that iron,

204
00:16:09,734 --> 00:16:13,570
it's gotta set real easy.

205
00:16:13,571 --> 00:16:15,705
Take an electric skillet,
put it over there

206
00:16:15,706 --> 00:16:17,809
and heat it up quick,
it's like five minutes,

207
00:16:18,009 --> 00:16:20,344
you got hot water.

208
00:16:20,345 --> 00:16:21,478
See, that one's steaming now,

209
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:24,114
that's almost good enough.

210
00:16:24,115 --> 00:16:28,951
Put a little water in that tub.

211
00:16:28,952 --> 00:16:31,654
Then the coffee pot.

212
00:16:31,655 --> 00:16:34,124
And by the time this one's done,

213
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,659
that one will be ready to go.

214
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:40,763
It's steaming now so it's ready.

215
00:16:40,764 --> 00:16:43,336
Take the whole thing in there.

216
00:16:46,274 --> 00:16:48,538
When you're in a place
where there's no work

217
00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:51,742
and you can't pay the bills
and it gets shut off

218
00:16:51,743 --> 00:16:54,878
you learn to survive,
the survival.

219
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:56,312
There's other people
waiting to take a bath.

220
00:16:56,313 --> 00:16:57,547
One minute.

221
00:16:57,548 --> 00:16:59,850
Minute's up, move.

222
00:16:59,851 --> 00:17:00,819
Go.

223
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,152
All right.

224
00:17:02,153 --> 00:17:05,521
Get that bath,
get that ass washed, boy.

225
00:17:05,522 --> 00:17:08,316
You're ready for
your next school day.

226
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:34,518
I don't know why
he wears shorts.

227
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:37,220
I guess he's just
crazy like that.

228
00:17:37,221 --> 00:17:40,556
My little, bitty,
baby twin sister.

229
00:17:40,557 --> 00:17:41,658
I'm not that short.

230
00:17:41,659 --> 00:17:45,095
Yeah, you are.

231
00:17:45,096 --> 00:17:46,697
She's just great.

232
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:50,100
I mean, we have our times
where I'll throw down

233
00:17:50,101 --> 00:17:54,037
and do a little bit of this.

234
00:17:54,038 --> 00:17:57,774
And there's times whenever
she goes...

235
00:17:57,775 --> 00:18:01,630
"Come on,
you wanna tussle?"

236
00:18:48,692 --> 00:18:51,795
I don't know if he thinks
he has something to prove.

237
00:18:51,796 --> 00:18:54,501
I have no clue,
but he's totally changed.

238
00:18:57,149 --> 00:18:59,202
Now he's Mr. Big and Bad
and gonna fight

239
00:18:59,203 --> 00:19:03,739
everybody out there.

240
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,509
Here, baby, tuck it under ya

241
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:10,213
and then when you sit down
you tuck it under you.

242
00:19:10,214 --> 00:19:12,250
There.

243
00:19:22,827 --> 00:19:25,362
My air is on
and we don't have a dog.

244
00:19:25,363 --> 00:19:26,963
Keep that door shut.

245
00:19:26,964 --> 00:19:29,165
Get out of the kitchen, you'll
eat supper when it's done.

246
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,066
I'm hungry!

247
00:19:30,067 --> 00:19:31,335
How can you be hungry, Pac?

248
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,537
You ate a whole can of raviolis
meant for three people.

249
00:19:34,538 --> 00:19:35,706
So?

250
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:37,574
I don't think you need
anything else right now.

251
00:19:37,575 --> 00:19:39,710
What do you want?

252
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:42,211
No.

253
00:19:42,212 --> 00:19:43,747
I said no, get out of my face.

254
00:19:43,748 --> 00:19:46,316
More.

255
00:19:46,317 --> 00:19:47,817
I don't think it's funny.

256
00:19:47,818 --> 00:19:49,286
I don't fucking care.

257
00:19:49,287 --> 00:19:50,586
Good.

258
00:19:50,587 --> 00:19:52,457
Goddamn!

259
00:20:00,964 --> 00:20:04,268
I never got to have any
dreams or ideals about my life.

260
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:06,470
I turned 17, moved out
of my mom's house,

261
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:09,373
started working,
met Jeremy and got married.

262
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,374
I never had a life,

263
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,376
I never had any dreams or hopes.

264
00:20:13,377 --> 00:20:15,912
It just went straight from
being at Momma's house

265
00:20:15,913 --> 00:20:17,980
to being a mother.

266
00:20:17,981 --> 00:20:22,318
I didn't get any
time in between.

267
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:24,320
Which I don't really regret it,

268
00:20:24,321 --> 00:20:26,489
I don't regret having my kids.

269
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:27,758
Sometimes I wish I would
have had time

270
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,192
to grow up a little bit more.

271
00:20:30,193 --> 00:20:32,362
Instead of just being thrown
from being 17

272
00:20:32,363 --> 00:20:35,065
to boom, you're an adult now.

273
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:37,034
But I made it.

274
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:38,302
Not always made
the right choices,

275
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:42,939
but I made it.

276
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:45,174
Get out of my freaking room!

277
00:20:45,175 --> 00:20:46,777
Keep this outta here!

278
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:47,844
Shut up!

279
00:20:47,845 --> 00:20:49,712
Get out of my room then.

280
00:20:49,713 --> 00:20:52,817
Beat feet, hit bricks.

281
00:20:54,652 --> 00:20:56,621
I was not playing with you!

282
00:21:17,937 --> 00:21:20,043
Come to think of it I think
we might need

283
00:21:20,044 --> 00:21:21,644
some barbecue sauce.

284
00:21:21,645 --> 00:21:23,313
Do we have barbecue sauce?

285
00:21:23,314 --> 00:21:24,314
Got some.

286
00:21:24,315 --> 00:21:26,182
Yeah, nevermind.

287
00:21:26,183 --> 00:21:29,185
We got barbecue sauce.

288
00:21:29,186 --> 00:21:31,755
I been back and forth
from Mom to Dad.

289
00:21:31,756 --> 00:21:33,190
All right, bye.

290
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:36,159
But like, finally
I just told Dad, like,

291
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,195
I didn't like his wife.

292
00:21:39,196 --> 00:21:41,498
So he kinda gave me
the opportunity

293
00:21:41,499 --> 00:21:44,704
to go live with Grandma.

294
00:21:47,704 --> 00:21:49,639
Grandma?

295
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,874
While you're, while you're out

296
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:56,246
will you get me either
a four pack of regular Monster

297
00:21:56,247 --> 00:21:59,482
or a two-,
two mangoes?

298
00:21:59,483 --> 00:22:00,517
No.

299
00:22:00,518 --> 00:22:04,688
Do, you could get mango
on food stamps.

300
00:22:04,689 --> 00:22:09,492
Yeah, but I only have like
two-hundred dollars.

301
00:22:09,493 --> 00:22:13,596
Two-hundred dollars
to hold us over.

302
00:22:13,597 --> 00:22:18,602
Now, that's not much for
everybody to last a week,

303
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:20,537
if not longer.

304
00:22:20,538 --> 00:22:23,239
Just please try to get one,
love you, bye.

305
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,242
I don't know. Bye.

306
00:22:26,243 --> 00:22:27,510
Man.

307
00:22:27,511 --> 00:22:30,447
I wish I di-, kept my change
that I gave her back

308
00:22:30,448 --> 00:22:32,615
the other day.

309
00:22:32,616 --> 00:22:35,155
I would have kept that
and got me one.

310
00:22:38,155 --> 00:22:41,191
'Cause I'm tired,
I wanna go to bed.

311
00:22:41,192 --> 00:22:43,293
Sorta.

312
00:22:43,294 --> 00:22:47,636
There's just half a day left,
though.

313
00:22:52,636 --> 00:22:56,806
I'm not happy.

314
00:22:56,807 --> 00:22:59,176
I'm a demented little kid.

315
00:23:00,211 --> 00:23:04,713
Well, not little.

316
00:23:04,714 --> 00:23:06,348
'Cause I got
a pretty big stomach,

317
00:23:06,349 --> 00:23:10,590
but I'm not little,
but I'm not huge.

318
00:23:21,956 --> 00:23:23,799
You gonna lay there
and go to sleep?

319
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,740
Probably.

320
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:33,943
He has absolutely no patience.

321
00:23:33,944 --> 00:23:38,949
Like, five minutes to us
seems like an hour to him.

322
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,451
And I don't know, you know,
what it is

323
00:23:41,452 --> 00:23:42,585
that makes him that way.

324
00:23:42,586 --> 00:23:46,623
He didn't used to be
quite like that.

325
00:23:46,624 --> 00:23:50,460
And he flares up real easy.

326
00:23:50,461 --> 00:23:52,863
Mostly to me, I think.

327
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:57,366
Because we kinda, you know,
battle back and forth

328
00:23:57,367 --> 00:24:00,336
and everything and I can
say one word

329
00:24:00,337 --> 00:24:02,506
and he'll take it wrong,
you know?

330
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:04,173
So then he's mad.

331
00:24:04,174 --> 00:24:07,210
But he's gotten pretty demanding

332
00:24:07,211 --> 00:24:09,219
and stuff like that.

333
00:24:15,015 --> 00:24:16,752
You wanna go see
my new knife now?

334
00:24:16,753 --> 00:24:21,490
Not right now.

335
00:24:21,491 --> 00:24:22,691
I got one.

336
00:24:22,692 --> 00:24:25,228
Mhmm.

337
00:24:25,229 --> 00:24:28,097
Quit it.

338
00:24:28,098 --> 00:24:32,669
It's stuck.

339
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,470
Oh, I need butane
and cigarettes.

340
00:24:34,471 --> 00:24:36,605
You already mentioned that
about four times.

341
00:24:36,606 --> 00:24:38,341
Okay.

342
00:24:38,342 --> 00:24:40,027
At least I got it
in your system.

343
00:24:41,011 --> 00:24:45,315
Like I said, I don't know
about the butane.

344
00:24:45,316 --> 00:24:46,283
Harley.

345
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:47,316
What?

346
00:24:47,317 --> 00:24:48,285
Quit pounding.

347
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:49,085
What?

348
00:24:49,086 --> 00:24:50,252
Shhh.

349
00:24:50,253 --> 00:24:53,623
Told you about that.

350
00:24:53,624 --> 00:24:57,059
Okay!

351
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:00,904
Get crunk.

352
00:26:24,214 --> 00:26:27,651
I'll just get the cheap ones.

353
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:32,287
Dude.

354
00:26:32,288 --> 00:26:34,826
Hey, man, I'm trying to find
something that's 15 cents.

355
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:36,759
Then I'll buy it.

356
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,694
You light it, run like hell,

357
00:26:38,695 --> 00:26:42,933
and yeah, it makes one of those.

358
00:26:43,933 --> 00:26:47,170
All right,
there's your synthetics.

359
00:26:47,171 --> 00:26:48,704
You guys have a good day
and have fun.

360
00:26:48,705 --> 00:26:51,508
All right, dude, you gotta
give me one package.

361
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:53,343
Yeah, give me one, too.

362
00:26:53,344 --> 00:26:57,781
Give me one.

363
00:27:52,502 --> 00:27:55,171
Here, I'll race Wesley.

364
00:27:55,172 --> 00:27:56,172
To what?

365
00:27:56,173 --> 00:27:57,106
The stop sign.

366
00:27:57,107 --> 00:27:57,742
On your mark, get set, go!

367
00:27:57,942 --> 00:27:59,743
Hey, I got boots on.

368
00:28:55,365 --> 00:28:58,802
Hey.

369
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:00,970
All right, lay down.

370
00:29:00,971 --> 00:29:02,739
Lay down.

371
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,240
There, I laid down.

372
00:29:12,583 --> 00:29:14,617
Turn off that light.

373
00:29:18,221 --> 00:29:21,056
The other light,
I have a cigarette.

374
00:29:21,057 --> 00:29:22,424
Are you fucking asleep?

375
00:29:22,425 --> 00:29:24,193
Yes!

376
00:29:24,194 --> 00:29:25,194
No.

377
00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:28,931
Please?

378
00:29:28,932 --> 00:29:31,805
Okay, all right.

379
00:29:34,805 --> 00:29:37,472
Get up on your pillows.

380
00:29:37,473 --> 00:29:39,075
There you go.

381
00:29:39,076 --> 00:29:41,911
There.

382
00:29:41,912 --> 00:29:44,047
Just because you owe me.

383
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:47,416
I don't owe you anything.

384
00:29:47,417 --> 00:29:49,420
Yes, you do.

385
00:30:00,297 --> 00:30:02,664
She's on this
medicine, you know,

386
00:30:02,665 --> 00:30:06,935
sleeping medicine
and it puts her out.

387
00:30:06,936 --> 00:30:08,905
But, yeah.

388
00:30:20,617 --> 00:30:23,952
She's always cooped up
in the house in her room

389
00:30:23,953 --> 00:30:27,056
watching TV or something.

390
00:30:27,057 --> 00:30:28,624
And I wish that she could
actually be there

391
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:31,060
to experience the world,
you know?

392
00:30:45,208 --> 00:30:47,576
All right, here we go
moment to go, get on in,

393
00:30:47,577 --> 00:30:49,312
got two pies left.

394
00:30:49,313 --> 00:30:50,313
Here we go...

395
00:30:51,448 --> 00:30:54,350
Who give a 100 dollar bill
there for Randy Bloomfield.

396
00:30:54,351 --> 00:30:55,752
Hundred dollar bill there.

397
00:30:58,955 --> 00:31:01,429
Two hundred dollar now,
gonna get three hundred.

398
00:31:04,862 --> 00:31:05,862
Gonna get three.

399
00:31:08,665 --> 00:31:09,699
Five, six.

400
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,133
Don't let him run away with it!

401
00:31:11,134 --> 00:31:12,969
Fourteen, fifteen, we're
getting close to the record.

402
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:15,238
Nineteen hundred now, 2,000!

403
00:31:15,239 --> 00:31:17,373
I got 2,000 now, looking at 21,

404
00:31:17,374 --> 00:31:21,810
28, now nine, now nine,
3,000, 3,000,

405
00:31:21,811 --> 00:31:23,747
3,000!

406
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,322
We all know that records
are made to be broken.

407
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:34,757
We got four more pies here.

408
00:31:34,758 --> 00:31:37,125
If we can break that
four more times

409
00:31:37,126 --> 00:31:40,963
then wouldn't nobody
challenge Rich Hill would they?

410
00:31:40,964 --> 00:31:42,499
Let's go after them.

411
00:32:02,952 --> 00:32:06,336
It's not fair.

412
00:32:20,336 --> 00:32:23,972
Fucking idiots didn't even
give me a straw.

413
00:32:23,973 --> 00:32:25,141
You're lucky you got the pop.

414
00:32:25,142 --> 00:32:27,410
Keep bitching and
I'll throw it away.

415
00:32:27,411 --> 00:32:29,778
How could I drink a pop
without a straw?

416
00:32:29,779 --> 00:32:30,546
You gonna push me?

417
00:32:30,547 --> 00:32:31,480
No.

418
00:32:31,481 --> 00:32:34,358
Shut up about it.

419
00:32:42,358 --> 00:32:43,692
We did good, girls.

420
00:32:43,693 --> 00:32:44,227
High five.

421
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:45,894
High five.

422
00:32:45,895 --> 00:32:48,463
Once I finally got here and
actually started helping.

423
00:32:48,464 --> 00:32:49,899
Now we'll get
all this shit taken home,

424
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,134
get all these people taken home,

425
00:32:52,135 --> 00:32:53,335
I'll go up and get lunch,

426
00:32:53,336 --> 00:32:54,670
we'll veg out while we eat lunch

427
00:32:54,671 --> 00:32:57,140
and then my kids are gonna
start deep cleaning.

428
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,075
This straw sucks,
I've broken it.

429
00:32:59,076 --> 00:33:02,412
No, that's how it was
whenever I got it.

430
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:03,679
You can have my straw.

431
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,346
Thank you.

432
00:33:04,347 --> 00:33:08,785
I just want a straw.

433
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:09,818
Shit.

434
00:33:09,819 --> 00:33:11,254
You're gonna finish your room,

435
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:14,957
the boys are gonna
do their room.

436
00:33:14,958 --> 00:33:17,479
What the fuck?

437
00:33:35,479 --> 00:33:37,846
This is disgusting.

438
00:33:37,847 --> 00:33:40,457
Can someone help me with this?

439
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:49,357
Tara, I have
no fucking room to clean.

440
00:33:49,358 --> 00:33:51,920
Yeah, I'm gonna laugh
when you get in trouble.

441
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,187
All the chores are done?

442
00:34:18,188 --> 00:34:20,923
That's why we're all
out here playing?

443
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:32,334
Appachey!

444
00:34:32,335 --> 00:34:34,904
He's in the shed, Mommy!

445
00:34:34,905 --> 00:34:37,874
I can't clean 'cause
there's baskets everywhere.

446
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:39,142
You can clean.

447
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:42,044
You can put this stuff back
where it goes, now.

448
00:34:42,045 --> 00:34:44,546
I can't, Mom,
there's baskets everywhere!

449
00:34:44,547 --> 00:34:46,816
There's not baskets by the wall!

450
00:34:46,817 --> 00:34:49,118
What am I supposed to
do with it?

451
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:50,852
Get it picked up.

452
00:34:50,853 --> 00:34:53,756
Mom, I, I can't
move both couches

453
00:34:53,757 --> 00:34:56,526
'cause there's shit everywhere.

454
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:58,528
So move the fucking baskets.

455
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:00,129
Where am I supposed to put them?

456
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:04,700
In here!

457
00:35:04,701 --> 00:35:07,005
Where does it look like
I'm putting them?

458
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:11,339
The whole goddamn couch
on top of them.

459
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,375
I fucking do it
and everybody starts

460
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:15,278
fucking acting stupid.

461
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,379
Fucking ridiculous.

462
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,121
No one wants to listen.

463
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:25,654
I would get a bag and start
picking up the trash

464
00:35:25,655 --> 00:35:28,797
on the floor.

465
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:35,198
I'm tired of spending
my fucking days off

466
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:38,301
doing this shit.

467
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:42,971
No one will fucking do
what they're told to do.

468
00:35:42,972 --> 00:35:44,406
I work hard enough
during the fucking week,

469
00:35:44,407 --> 00:35:48,109
I shouldn't have to clean
on my days off.

470
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:52,291
Shit should already
fucking be done.

471
00:36:18,675 --> 00:36:21,843
How are you doing the face?

472
00:36:21,844 --> 00:36:23,479
The eyes are done?

473
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,482
Not reddened in yet,
but the outline's done.

474
00:36:26,483 --> 00:36:30,886
Oh, all right.

475
00:36:30,887 --> 00:36:31,953
Get a picture!

476
00:36:31,954 --> 00:36:33,888
What, what.

477
00:36:33,889 --> 00:36:35,790
You ain't got no pancake mix,
what?

478
00:36:35,791 --> 00:36:39,127
Can't handle all this.

479
00:36:39,128 --> 00:36:40,096
Did you take one with
the cigarette

480
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:41,397
in my mouth, though?

481
00:36:41,398 --> 00:36:42,832
Yeah, I got one with
the cigarette in your mouth,

482
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:45,833
but you might not be able to
send one to your mom with it.

483
00:36:56,545 --> 00:36:57,413
Trick or treat!

484
00:36:57,414 --> 00:36:58,247
Yeah, trick or treat.

485
00:36:58,248 --> 00:36:59,547
Yeah.

486
00:36:59,548 --> 00:37:03,255
You love us!

487
00:37:06,255 --> 00:37:10,625
Ain't we too old for this?

488
00:37:10,626 --> 00:37:12,861
Uncle Jimmy!

489
00:37:12,862 --> 00:37:13,828
What are you doing?

490
00:37:13,829 --> 00:37:14,863
Y'all out having fun?

491
00:37:14,864 --> 00:37:16,031
Yeah.

492
00:37:16,032 --> 00:37:17,232
Man there's been peeps
all over the place

493
00:37:17,233 --> 00:37:18,634
running around here,
you know that?

494
00:37:18,635 --> 00:37:19,334
Is there?

495
00:37:19,335 --> 00:37:20,268
Here, you need more.

496
00:37:20,269 --> 00:37:21,971
I need more.

497
00:37:21,972 --> 00:37:26,642
All right, Uncle Jimmy.

498
00:37:26,643 --> 00:37:28,377
He gave me a handful
and then he gave me

499
00:37:28,378 --> 00:37:32,848
another big handful and said
"You need more."

500
00:37:32,849 --> 00:37:37,386
Funny.

501
00:37:37,387 --> 00:37:38,821
Man, we need to hit more houses

502
00:37:39,021 --> 00:37:43,292
'cause no chocolate's
not working for me.

503
00:37:43,293 --> 00:37:45,127
I ate all my chocolate.

504
00:37:45,128 --> 00:37:48,964
I think.

505
00:37:48,965 --> 00:37:52,500
Man.

506
00:37:52,501 --> 00:37:54,870
Yup, I ate all my chocolate.

507
00:37:54,871 --> 00:37:57,073
That's for sure.

508
00:37:57,074 --> 00:37:59,207
That's what I go
trick or treating for.

509
00:37:59,208 --> 00:38:01,444
I don't even check the candy.

510
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:04,113
I mean, what...

511
00:38:04,114 --> 00:38:06,848
The worst thing they're gonna
do is shove a razor blade

512
00:38:06,849 --> 00:38:10,785
and if they're that
stu-,

513
00:38:10,786 --> 00:38:14,122
if they got that much
stupidity in them

514
00:38:14,123 --> 00:38:18,861
then it's not even worth
having them alive.

515
00:38:18,862 --> 00:38:20,962
I don't think so.

516
00:38:20,963 --> 00:38:23,536
I mean, who wants to kill
a couple of kids?

517
00:38:26,536 --> 00:38:28,971
That's why I got strong feelings

518
00:38:28,972 --> 00:38:31,374
about rape, too.

519
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:33,274
I don't like it.

520
00:38:33,275 --> 00:38:35,251
I'm against it.

521
00:38:41,251 --> 00:38:44,285
'Cause there are some things

522
00:38:44,286 --> 00:38:46,355
that have happened to me

523
00:38:46,356 --> 00:38:49,658
that I don't really talk about,

524
00:38:49,659 --> 00:38:52,861
but they still happened.

525
00:38:52,862 --> 00:38:55,864
I mean, I ain't
forgot about 'em.

526
00:38:55,865 --> 00:39:00,935
I I basically try
to forget about 'em,

527
00:39:00,936 --> 00:39:02,370
don't think about it,

528
00:39:02,371 --> 00:39:05,674
and then it don't really,

529
00:39:05,675 --> 00:39:08,581
it don't come up too much
in conversation.

530
00:39:12,581 --> 00:39:15,250
That and anybody that,

531
00:39:15,251 --> 00:39:18,453
anybody that rapes a kid
should be murdered,

532
00:39:18,454 --> 00:39:20,422
should just be shot.

533
00:39:20,423 --> 00:39:25,294
Like, the cops
should just shoot him.

534
00:39:25,295 --> 00:39:28,930
Is the way I feel about it.

535
00:39:28,931 --> 00:39:31,933
That or the kid
that was raped by that person

536
00:39:31,934 --> 00:39:34,404
should shoot them theirself.

537
00:39:42,945 --> 00:39:44,581
I don't see nobody.

538
00:40:01,364 --> 00:40:05,838
Grandma, you're gonna
have to get on my eyes.

539
00:40:08,838 --> 00:40:12,540
Do up around my eyebrow ring
and stuff.

540
00:40:12,541 --> 00:40:16,578
Like that, please.

541
00:40:16,579 --> 00:40:18,547
You gotta kinda
squat down a little.

542
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:28,290
I'm gonna try not to hit
the eyebrow ring.

543
00:40:28,291 --> 00:40:29,558
It don't matter.

544
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:30,625
Does it hurt?

545
00:40:30,626 --> 00:40:31,094
No.

546
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,128
Ever?

547
00:42:11,994 --> 00:42:14,997
We wanted to get out
of Rich Hill

548
00:42:14,998 --> 00:42:18,275
because we
couldn't make it there.

549
00:42:25,092 --> 00:42:26,408
So we ended up packing up

550
00:42:26,409 --> 00:42:29,851
and moving here to Thayer.

551
00:42:34,851 --> 00:42:37,185
I was so desperate when
I first got here.

552
00:42:37,186 --> 00:42:40,622
I got this old time push mower.

553
00:42:40,623 --> 00:42:42,924
And I went out and mowed
three yards with that

554
00:42:42,925 --> 00:42:45,426
and made $20.

555
00:42:45,427 --> 00:42:46,629
I went and bought me
a cheeseburger

556
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:49,007
and some football gloves.

557
00:42:57,007 --> 00:42:58,218
I'm so tired of moving.

558
00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:01,743
It's like a joke now.

559
00:43:01,744 --> 00:43:04,695
Moving, packing and moving.

560
00:43:52,695 --> 00:43:55,330
I honestly think that
God's gonna give me friends

561
00:43:55,331 --> 00:43:57,899
and God's gonna give me
people that hate me.

562
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:00,703
God's gonna give me
girls that like me.

563
00:44:00,704 --> 00:44:02,671
So I just let it all
form together,

564
00:44:02,672 --> 00:44:03,872
I just stay to myself,

565
00:44:03,873 --> 00:44:07,942
and whenever I get friends,
I have friends.

566
00:44:07,943 --> 00:44:09,877
I want you to read
one of your questions here

567
00:44:09,878 --> 00:44:12,314
from lesson one.

568
00:44:12,315 --> 00:44:15,920
I mean, I hate moving,
but I know if we do, we do.

569
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,156
I have no say in what happens.

570
00:44:21,157 --> 00:44:26,161
They're the parents,
I'm just a kid.

I think the last time
that my son

580
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,834
tried to wake me up in Rich Hill

581
00:45:05,835 --> 00:45:10,372
and I wouldn't wake up,
that was a turning point.

582
00:45:10,373 --> 00:45:11,672
I remember that night.

583
00:45:11,673 --> 00:45:12,833
It was on the Fourth of July.

584
00:45:13,009 --> 00:45:15,944
Yeah, that's when I woke up,
was on the Fourth.

585
00:45:15,945 --> 00:45:20,249
And I went out on
the first of July, that night,

586
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:23,718
and when I finally
did come to Willie told me,

587
00:45:23,719 --> 00:45:27,388
Willie told me what day it was
and I'm like, no way.

588
00:45:27,389 --> 00:45:29,429
You know, that's enough.

No, it don't.

593
00:45:43,539 --> 00:45:45,174
It's on your side, right?

594
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:48,974
Yellow means stop
and proceed with caution.

595
00:46:25,547 --> 00:46:27,349

Thank you, Willie.

606
00:47:14,563 --> 00:47:17,340
Give him a hand.

607
00:47:32,648 --> 00:47:36,718
It feels good to have
all the bills paid for once.

608
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:40,821
Caught up, pretty much.

609
00:47:40,822 --> 00:47:43,759
But I hate money.

610
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,562
So this summer's gonna be
a whole new ball game.

611
00:47:47,563 --> 00:47:49,765
Be lots of work.

612
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:54,468
Get the kids some things
they might want, for once.

613
00:47:54,469 --> 00:47:56,071
Like to take a day
and take the kids

614
00:47:56,072 --> 00:47:58,007
down to WalMart
or the dollar store

615
00:47:59,007 --> 00:48:01,410
and just let 'em buy
whatever they want,

616
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:04,078
in a reasonable amount.

617
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:07,214
About $400 apiece
worth of stuff.

618
00:48:07,215 --> 00:48:10,584
They'll love that.

619
00:48:10,585 --> 00:48:13,154
Each year we always try
to get a strategy

620
00:48:13,155 --> 00:48:16,959
to do something different
to better

621
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,861
the whole, whole program

622
00:48:19,862 --> 00:48:23,704
of them growing up
and us being a parent.

623
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:29,738
I was wondering where
everybody went.

624
00:48:29,739 --> 00:48:30,805
Just out here.

625
00:48:30,806 --> 00:48:33,341
Oh, okay.

626
00:48:33,342 --> 00:48:35,544
It's too cold out here,
I'm going back in.

627
00:48:35,545 --> 00:48:36,377
You wanna go in?

628
00:48:36,378 --> 00:48:37,378
Let's go in.

629
00:49:34,771 --> 00:49:39,607
I was thinking about
moving to China.

630
00:49:39,608 --> 00:49:44,279
Think about moving to China
and becoming an art teacher.

631
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,751
'Cause paintings and stuff
from China are friggin' awesome.

632
00:49:49,751 --> 00:49:52,422
You get to sit there
and draw dragons all day.

633
00:50:04,233 --> 00:50:09,037
I praise God, I worship Him.

634
00:50:09,038 --> 00:50:11,673
And I pray to Him every night.

635
00:50:17,512 --> 00:50:22,517
Nothing's came,
but that ain't gonna stop me.

636
00:50:22,518 --> 00:50:25,319
This is what goes
through my mind.

637
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:27,824
God has to be busy
with everyone else.

638
00:50:37,365 --> 00:50:42,337
Eventually He will come
into my life.

639
00:50:42,338 --> 00:50:46,274
I hope it happens.

640
00:50:46,275 --> 00:50:49,782
It's gonna break my heart
if it don't.

641
00:50:52,782 --> 00:50:56,057
You wanna hear something
really loud?

642
00:51:02,019 --> 00:51:04,125
Me and my mom used to
listen to this song

643
00:51:04,126 --> 00:51:07,129

00:51:40,762 --> 00:51:43,564
was down at the grocery store.

655
00:51:43,565 --> 00:51:47,804
And they ask her what
Joanne got arrested for.

656
00:51:48,404 --> 00:51:50,272
And she says "I don't know,
I hadn't heard

657
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:52,140
anything about it."

658
00:51:52,141 --> 00:51:54,576
So she called me up,
I was babysitting her kids,

659
00:51:54,577 --> 00:51:57,946
and she called me up
and she said,

660
00:51:57,947 --> 00:52:00,714
"Mom, what'd Jo
get arrested for?"

661
00:52:00,715 --> 00:52:02,384
And I said, "I don't know,
I'm up here

662
00:52:02,385 --> 00:52:05,520
babysitting your kids."

663
00:52:05,521 --> 00:52:09,124
And she said, "Well, I'll see
what I can find out."

664
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:12,660
And when I, when I actually
heard what it was for

665
00:52:12,661 --> 00:52:17,204
was the next morning
when she was on TV.

666
00:52:22,204 --> 00:52:25,207
Yeah, it was all over
the news, the internet.

667
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:27,788
Oh, I know.

668
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:40,355
The prosecuting attorney,

669
00:52:40,356 --> 00:52:41,989
every time he opened
his mouth up,

670
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:45,297
he said that she was
a danger to society.

671
00:52:48,297 --> 00:52:52,801
Which she wasn't.

672
00:52:52,802 --> 00:52:56,507
She's always done everything
she can for the kids.

673
00:52:58,507 --> 00:53:02,849
And she wasn't a danger
to society.

674
00:53:07,849 --> 00:53:10,852
There's only a few people
that really actually know

675
00:53:10,853 --> 00:53:13,224
the whole truth.

676
00:53:16,224 --> 00:53:20,495
I was raped.

677
00:53:20,496 --> 00:53:25,267
By my stepfather.

678
00:53:25,268 --> 00:53:28,236
The cops didn't get called,
nothing happened.

679
00:53:28,237 --> 00:53:31,876
We, it was best to just
leave it alone.

680
00:53:33,876 --> 00:53:37,345
They didn't even bring up
charges against him.

681
00:53:37,346 --> 00:53:38,779
They won't.

682
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:40,214
No, they said they wouldn't
because there wasn't

683
00:53:40,215 --> 00:53:41,649
enough evidence.

684
00:53:41,650 --> 00:53:45,587
Yeah, there wasn't
enough evidence.

685
00:53:45,588 --> 00:53:50,292
So she's locked up for nothing
and he goes scot-free.

686
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:53,943
Yup.

687
00:54:08,943 --> 00:54:13,614
I'm just a waitress and
a mother that loves her kids.

688
00:54:13,615 --> 00:54:17,151
There's nothing really
special about me.

689
00:54:17,152 --> 00:54:19,821
Never has been, never will be.

690
00:54:19,822 --> 00:54:23,390
It never came out until after
I had already been sentenced.

691
00:54:23,391 --> 00:54:27,361
The judge sat there and ask me

692
00:54:27,362 --> 00:54:30,631
why did I try
to kill my husband.

693
00:54:30,632 --> 00:54:35,236
And I told him because my son
had been sexually abused

694
00:54:35,237 --> 00:54:38,138
and all he had to say was

695
00:54:38,139 --> 00:54:41,408
"I'm sorry about your
situation."

696
00:54:41,409 --> 00:54:45,113
I don't understand
this whole thing.

697
00:54:45,114 --> 00:54:50,118
How the state can take
a mom away from her kids,

698
00:54:50,119 --> 00:54:53,821
but don't do anything
to the person

699
00:54:53,822 --> 00:54:56,857
who hurt him so bad.

700
00:54:56,858 --> 00:55:00,398
He is an angry kid
because of it.

701
00:55:03,398 --> 00:55:06,334
And right now,
little phone calls,

702
00:55:06,335 --> 00:55:08,903
he's stronger than I am.

703
00:55:08,904 --> 00:55:10,772
He tells me keep my head up,

704
00:55:10,773 --> 00:55:13,674
"Mom, we'll get through this
together."

705
00:55:13,675 --> 00:55:15,843
And this is a 15 year old boy

706
00:55:15,844 --> 00:55:19,480
telling his 33 year old mom

707
00:55:19,481 --> 00:55:23,884
that it's all gonna be okay.

708
00:55:23,885 --> 00:55:28,857
So he's,
he's stronger than I am.

709
00:55:28,858 --> 00:55:31,900
And I give him that.

715
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:20,674
Everything's starting to
come together

716
00:56:20,675 --> 00:56:22,743
in little pieces.

717
00:56:22,744 --> 00:56:24,379
I just have to stick
the glue in there

718
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,315
to make 'em fit, you know?

719
00:56:36,257 --> 00:56:40,727
We're probably gonna end up
settling down here.

720
00:56:40,728 --> 00:56:43,363
This is, like whenever
I'm antsy, you know...

All right, move.

725
00:56:51,206 --> 00:56:52,739
Mom, but look,
whenever I'm on defense

726
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:55,576
playing safety
I'll sit there and be like...

727
00:56:55,577 --> 00:56:57,278
I gotta show you all
my battle scars

728
00:56:57,279 --> 00:56:59,647

just like you like it.

738
00:57:47,896 --> 00:57:49,196
When you first saw me
go out there for kickoff

739
00:57:49,197 --> 00:57:51,165
what'd ya think?

740
00:57:51,166 --> 00:57:53,468
I think ya did good.

741
00:57:53,469 --> 00:57:54,301
No, I mean, what were
you thinking

742
00:57:54,302 --> 00:57:56,971
when I ran out down the field?

743
00:57:56,972 --> 00:58:00,542
There's my boy.

744
00:58:00,543 --> 00:58:05,046
I still think
I could have done better.

745
00:58:05,047 --> 00:58:08,149
I seen you jump on that guy
on the fumble.

746
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:10,856
Where they fumbled the ball.

747
00:58:14,856 --> 00:58:16,491
I gotta find a job tomorrow.

748
00:58:16,492 --> 00:58:17,725
Do like I do.

749
00:58:17,726 --> 00:58:18,993
Walk around until you see
something looks like

750
00:58:18,994 --> 00:58:20,828
it needs done.

751
00:58:20,829 --> 00:58:22,663
Painting or something.

752
00:58:22,664 --> 00:58:25,732
Pulling some weeds.

753
00:58:25,733 --> 00:58:29,172
I don't know.

754
00:58:31,130 --> 00:58:32,973
Might be able to go down
and get you

755
00:58:32,974 --> 00:58:36,447
a little bank account,
save you up some money.

756
00:58:38,447 --> 00:58:41,049
Trust me, I always,

757
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:42,383
I always thought, you know,

758
00:58:42,384 --> 00:58:45,319
well, there's always
next week's paycheck

759
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:49,924
and I'd spend mine,
not put none up.

760
00:58:49,925 --> 00:58:51,326
You seen my shoes, you know,
what I've had to do

761
00:58:51,327 --> 00:58:54,529
just to get to the next day.

762
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:56,598
Some of the things.

763
00:58:56,599 --> 00:59:00,100
So be ahead of the game.

764
00:59:00,101 --> 00:59:03,203
Be putting you some funds away.

765
00:59:03,204 --> 00:59:06,274
Then when you're out
on your own you got some,

766
00:59:06,275 --> 00:59:09,391
you don't have to do
like what I did.

767
00:59:57,291 --> 00:59:58,927
Fuck.

768
01:00:06,068 --> 01:00:07,835
Stupid.

769
01:00:13,275 --> 01:00:15,076
That was not the train
that was there

770
01:00:15,077 --> 01:00:17,146
the last time we came.

771
01:00:33,161 --> 01:00:35,793
Man, what the fuck's up with
all this ice and shit?

772
01:00:38,067 --> 01:00:39,167
Hey, you guys wanna see
something

773
01:00:39,168 --> 01:00:41,435
really fucking amazing?

774
01:00:41,436 --> 01:00:43,271
Look at this shit.

775
01:00:49,878 --> 01:00:51,712
On the shoe.

776
01:00:51,713 --> 01:00:53,281
That did not go through.

777
01:00:53,282 --> 01:00:54,515
I'm trying to break all the ice,

778
01:00:54,516 --> 01:00:56,617
but I don't think
it's gonna happen.

779
01:01:02,724 --> 01:01:04,892
That was amazing.

780
01:01:04,893 --> 01:01:06,060
You know what?

781
01:01:06,061 --> 01:01:06,595
Fuck it.

782
01:01:06,795 --> 01:01:08,530
I'm walking through it.

783
01:01:23,378 --> 01:01:25,748
The amazing splatter art.

784
01:02:17,431 --> 01:02:21,102
I'm tired.

785
01:02:21,103 --> 01:02:24,772
Too early for me.

786
01:02:24,773 --> 01:02:28,885
I'm ready to go back to sleep.

787
01:02:37,885 --> 01:02:39,986
Today's gonna be fun.

788
01:02:39,987 --> 01:02:43,124
Today's my birthday, man,
I'm 16.

789
01:02:43,125 --> 01:02:46,400
Yeah, today's gonna be fun.

790
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,468
I got told I dress
like a hoochie.

791
01:02:54,469 --> 01:02:57,641
I'm not a fucking girl.

792
01:03:00,641 --> 01:03:04,678
Today's awesome.

793
01:03:04,679 --> 01:03:06,279
Come on, what's today?

794
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:08,049
Nothing you could think of?

795
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:10,350
Nothing?

796
01:03:10,351 --> 01:03:12,819
Got anything to say to me?

797
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:16,189
Nothing at all?

798
01:03:16,190 --> 01:03:18,158
'Sup Chi?

799
01:03:18,159 --> 01:03:19,727
Whatever.

800
01:03:19,728 --> 01:03:22,340
All right, whatever.

801
01:03:53,862 --> 01:03:55,495
Have you been to see the nurse?

802
01:03:55,496 --> 01:03:56,964
The nurse? Yeah.

803
01:03:56,965 --> 01:03:58,265
This morning you have?

804
01:03:58,266 --> 01:03:58,766
Yeah.

805
01:03:58,867 --> 01:04:00,368
What'd she say?

806
01:04:00,369 --> 01:04:02,502
She just said it was 98.

807
01:04:02,503 --> 01:04:05,839
So you don't have a fever.

808
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:07,741
I know you don't feel 100%,
but...

809
01:04:07,742 --> 01:04:10,877
I don't even feel 50%.

810
01:04:10,878 --> 01:04:13,613
We've been at school
for a month and two weeks

811
01:04:13,614 --> 01:04:16,216
and every day except one you
have shown up in this office...

812
01:04:16,217 --> 01:04:18,785
No, about five or six.

813
01:04:18,786 --> 01:04:19,854
...to call your grandma
and go home

814
01:04:19,855 --> 01:04:21,221
and that's not an option.

815
01:04:21,222 --> 01:04:23,390
I can't barely breathe
and you want me to stay here

816
01:04:23,391 --> 01:04:25,392
and suffer through it.

817
01:04:25,393 --> 01:04:26,660
Harley, there is a lot
of people here

818
01:04:26,661 --> 01:04:28,296
who aren't 100%.

819
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:30,497
And they're still
gonna make it work.

820
01:04:30,498 --> 01:04:32,433
And I need you to make it work.

821
01:04:32,434 --> 01:04:35,502
I barely can breathe.

822
01:04:35,503 --> 01:04:38,506
On your contract
that I have on my desk,

823
01:04:38,507 --> 01:04:40,908
the contract you signed
with the juvenile office,

824
01:04:40,909 --> 01:04:41,908
and I said...

825
01:04:41,909 --> 01:04:43,910
I didn't even wanna sign that!

826
01:04:43,911 --> 01:04:45,111
But you did.

827
01:04:45,112 --> 01:04:46,413
I had to.

828
01:04:46,414 --> 01:04:47,848
There was no choice in it
for me.

829
01:04:47,849 --> 01:04:49,616
You're right.

830
01:04:49,617 --> 01:04:51,685
You have to be in school.

831
01:04:51,686 --> 01:04:55,122
I have to be in school,
but if I can't...

832
01:04:55,123 --> 01:04:58,959
You played the sick card
too much.

833
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:02,807
I can't...

834
01:05:12,807 --> 01:05:14,241
You wanna go to...?

835
01:05:14,242 --> 01:05:15,475
You're gonna...

836
01:05:15,476 --> 01:05:16,209
Harley.

837
01:05:16,210 --> 01:05:18,145
I'm just gonna lose it.

838
01:05:18,146 --> 01:05:20,348
You're gonna see me
lose my temper and I...

839
01:05:20,349 --> 01:05:22,415
You don't need
to lose your temper.

840
01:05:22,416 --> 01:05:24,451
I cannot breathe.

841
01:05:24,452 --> 01:05:26,053
If I need to be treated for it,

842
01:05:26,054 --> 01:05:27,788
then I need to be treated.

843
01:05:27,789 --> 01:05:28,888
I'm just letting you know
where I'm at

844
01:05:28,889 --> 01:05:29,656
on the situation.

845
01:05:29,657 --> 01:05:30,825
If you sign out and leave

846
01:05:30,826 --> 01:05:32,593
without your grandmother's
permission

847
01:05:32,594 --> 01:05:34,395
you are truant.

848
01:05:34,396 --> 01:05:38,598
You know where I'm at
on this, right?

849
01:05:38,599 --> 01:05:41,267
I'll walk home because
I honestly don't care if they...

850
01:05:41,268 --> 01:05:42,903
You understand if you walk home

851
01:05:42,904 --> 01:05:44,904
I have to call Anthony
at the juvenile office

852
01:05:44,905 --> 01:05:46,172
and they're gonna come
and pick you up.

853
01:05:46,173 --> 01:05:47,893
Well, you're not giving me
any more options.

854
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:52,480
You have given yourself
no more options.

855
01:05:52,481 --> 01:05:54,814
The most important thing for you
is your education.

856
01:05:54,815 --> 01:05:57,451
Most important thing for me
is my family,

857
01:05:57,452 --> 01:05:58,618
that's all I need.

858
01:05:58,619 --> 01:05:59,787
I don't need a education,

859
01:05:59,788 --> 01:06:02,522
I could make it out there
on my own

860
01:06:02,523 --> 01:06:07,528
without an education.

861
01:06:07,529 --> 01:06:10,570
Okay.

862
01:06:16,286 --> 01:06:17,971
I'm just going home,
Mr. Ruddert,

863
01:06:17,972 --> 01:06:21,375
'cause my grandma's not here.

864
01:06:21,376 --> 01:06:23,544
You know what's gonna happen
if you do.

865
01:06:23,545 --> 01:06:24,712
What?

866
01:06:24,713 --> 01:06:28,214
You're gonna be truant,
I have to call it in.

867
01:06:28,215 --> 01:06:29,817
Well, you won't let me
call and speak

868
01:06:29,818 --> 01:06:31,218
with my grandmother.

869
01:06:31,219 --> 01:06:34,654
That's right, 'cause
you abused that privilege.

870
01:06:34,655 --> 01:06:37,857
Alls I'm doing is asking her
if she's still coming in.

871
01:06:37,858 --> 01:06:39,326
That's all you did
the day before

872
01:06:39,327 --> 01:06:41,861
and the day before
and the day before.

873
01:06:41,862 --> 01:06:42,997
So you want me to walk out.

874
01:06:42,998 --> 01:06:44,198
No, I do not.

875
01:06:44,199 --> 01:06:45,165
Yeah, you do,
'cause you're not...

876
01:06:45,166 --> 01:06:46,366
You know what I want you to do,

877
01:06:46,367 --> 01:06:47,935
I want you to go to class.

878
01:06:47,936 --> 01:06:50,916
I don't want you to walk out.

879
01:07:00,916 --> 01:07:03,358
Damn.

880
01:07:11,358 --> 01:07:14,595
He's getting to the point
where he's really volatile.

881
01:07:14,596 --> 01:07:17,497
You know, and I think we had
talked about that before

882
01:07:17,498 --> 01:07:19,767
and stuff and it's
escalated from there.

883
01:07:19,768 --> 01:07:22,169
What's your opinion
on what we need to do about it?

884
01:07:22,170 --> 01:07:27,040
I would say, you know,
have the meds checked first,

885
01:07:27,041 --> 01:07:29,109
like, 'cause I don't think
they're working.

886
01:07:29,110 --> 01:07:32,312
It's... something has to
get figured out.

887
01:07:32,313 --> 01:07:33,848
Right, yeah.

888
01:07:33,849 --> 01:07:35,482
We're doing no good right now.

889
01:07:35,483 --> 01:07:36,984
Yeah, yeah.

890
01:07:36,985 --> 01:07:38,252
If something has to be done,

891
01:07:38,253 --> 01:07:39,620
it could mean removal
from your home.

892
01:07:39,621 --> 01:07:41,187
Yeah.

893
01:07:41,188 --> 01:07:43,957
- All right?
- Okay, bye-bye.

894
01:07:43,958 --> 01:07:46,727
What I'm afraid of
is Anthony picking me up

895
01:07:46,728 --> 01:07:49,096
and taking me to DYS
or something.

896
01:07:49,097 --> 01:07:53,634
Let me tell ya,
you keep walking out, he will.

897
01:07:53,635 --> 01:07:57,971
If you agree, you know,
to go wherever, you know,

898
01:07:57,972 --> 01:07:59,372
for a week or
something like that

899
01:07:59,373 --> 01:08:01,107
and have your meds evaluated

900
01:08:01,108 --> 01:08:03,877
then maybe they won't
be so hard on ya.

901
01:08:03,878 --> 01:08:06,881
But if you keep
walking out of school, yes.

902
01:08:06,882 --> 01:08:10,350
He will pick you up and I
won't have any say-so in it.

903
01:08:10,351 --> 01:08:12,118
Yeah, all right.

904
01:08:12,119 --> 01:08:13,319
All right?

905
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:14,488
All right.

906
01:08:14,489 --> 01:08:18,158
All right.

907
01:08:18,159 --> 01:08:19,093
Sorry.

908
01:08:19,094 --> 01:08:21,262
All right.

909
01:08:59,833 --> 01:09:02,502
Whenever I move I always say,

910
01:09:02,503 --> 01:09:05,661
"Oh, I don't wanna move, Dad,
I have friends here," you know?

911
01:09:13,981 --> 01:09:18,251
God wanted us to come back here
for a reason.

912
01:09:18,252 --> 01:09:20,622
I haven't found it out yet,
but I will.

913
01:09:38,006 --> 01:09:39,505
My dad,

914
01:09:39,506 --> 01:09:42,210
he's having troubles
making money.

915
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:47,881
We're living with my cousins.

916
01:09:53,354 --> 01:09:56,357
We have clothes on our back.

917
01:09:56,358 --> 01:09:58,725
We have food in our stomach.

918
01:09:58,726 --> 01:10:02,429
But we don't have a roof
over our head.

919
01:10:02,430 --> 01:10:04,864
It ain't ours.

920
01:10:04,865 --> 01:10:07,435
It ain't ours to do
what we want with it.

921
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:54,247
♪ Out in the Big Bend ♪

922
01:10:54,248 --> 01:11:00,754
♪ Doing it all to ghost town
baritone campfire songs ♪

923
01:11:00,755 --> 01:11:03,090

924
01:11:03,091 --> 01:11:07,995
♪ To the far out post

925
01:11:07,996 --> 01:11:11,398
There just isn't no work.

926
01:11:11,399 --> 01:11:15,572
Dates changed, plans changed
and everything changes.

927
01:11:17,172 --> 01:11:18,906
And it all could have
probably been fixed

928
01:11:18,907 --> 01:11:23,676
with $1500 which makes it sad.

929
01:11:23,677 --> 01:11:25,245
And just can't make that,
I mean,

930
01:11:25,246 --> 01:11:28,247
you can't make that
in a week or two or a month,

931
01:11:28,248 --> 01:11:30,617
and down there
it really slowed down.

932
01:11:30,618 --> 01:11:32,519
He does not like to hold
a steady job,

933
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:35,389
he does not like to hold
a steady career.

934
01:11:35,390 --> 01:11:38,524
And that's another reason
why he isn't a top dog,

935
01:11:38,525 --> 01:11:39,727
you know?

936
01:11:39,728 --> 01:11:42,328
He wants to start to
try to do new things.

937
01:11:42,329 --> 01:11:45,232
Like, first he was into
inventing stuff

938
01:11:45,233 --> 01:11:47,300
and singing and then
went back to inventing

939
01:11:47,301 --> 01:11:52,139
and now he's wanting to
go dig for gold or silver

940
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:56,443
or something like that,
prospecting.

941
01:11:56,444 --> 01:11:58,679
I mean, that's my dad's thing,
it's his life,

942
01:11:58,680 --> 01:11:59,813
he has to live it, you know?

943
01:11:59,814 --> 01:12:03,050
He only has one life to live.

944
01:12:03,051 --> 01:12:06,153
Only thing anybody wants
is money.

945
01:12:06,154 --> 01:12:07,787
A lot of people are like that.

946
01:12:07,788 --> 01:12:09,756
And me, I don't care.

947
01:12:09,757 --> 01:12:13,827
I mean, I'm tired of money,
I'm gonna go get gold.

948
01:12:13,828 --> 01:12:15,696
Diamonds.

949
01:12:15,697 --> 01:12:18,131
Whether it's Alaska or Australia

950
01:12:18,132 --> 01:12:20,938
or go to England.

951
01:12:23,938 --> 01:12:26,773
That's the solution.

952
01:12:26,774 --> 01:12:30,277
Can't find a job,
go get some gold.

953
01:12:30,278 --> 01:12:33,958
Platinum, silver, whatever.

954
01:12:44,958 --> 01:12:48,435
Oh, fuck.

955
01:12:53,435 --> 01:12:56,769
Don't fuck with me.

956
01:12:56,770 --> 01:13:00,040
Kind of gun you got, bitch?

957
01:13:00,041 --> 01:13:02,913
He's jamming our radar.

958
01:13:05,913 --> 01:13:08,215
I got in a fight at school.

959
01:13:08,216 --> 01:13:10,584
A kid kicked me in the nuts,

960
01:13:10,585 --> 01:13:14,353
so I punched him in his face.

961
01:13:14,354 --> 01:13:16,689
And then I went to court
'cause they kicked me out

962
01:13:16,690 --> 01:13:19,962
for 45 days and I can't
go to school.

963
01:13:21,962 --> 01:13:25,898
Assault is the charge
they're using against me.

964
01:13:25,899 --> 01:13:28,434
So we contacted them
and they wouldn't

965
01:13:28,435 --> 01:13:31,071
forgo the suspension
so I have to go

966
01:13:31,072 --> 01:13:33,773
to Cass County Detention Center

967
01:13:33,774 --> 01:13:36,054
to finish out school.

968
01:13:46,054 --> 01:13:47,321
Yeah, he killed me.

969
01:13:47,322 --> 01:13:49,288
Fuck, yeah.

970
01:13:49,289 --> 01:13:50,691
All he has to do
is go to school,

971
01:13:50,692 --> 01:13:52,725
keep his hands to himself,
keep his mouth to himself,

972
01:13:52,726 --> 01:13:55,062
do his schoolwork
and he could succeed

973
01:13:55,063 --> 01:13:56,695
and go on to the middle school.

974
01:13:57,030 --> 01:13:59,765
And the day after we had
this conversation with him,

975
01:13:59,766 --> 01:14:03,773
again, is the day that he
assaulted another student.

976
01:14:05,773 --> 01:14:08,521
That fucking sucks.

977
01:14:41,708 --> 01:14:44,012
I know how it's gonna happen
already.

978
01:14:44,743 --> 01:14:46,112
We'll go before the judge,

979
01:14:46,113 --> 01:14:49,049
the judge'll lift
the suspended sentence,

980
01:14:49,050 --> 01:14:53,186
and he'll go to detention
until he goes to DYS.

981
01:14:54,721 --> 01:14:58,126
It's kinda like a prison
type procedure.

982
01:15:04,131 --> 01:15:06,400
I think it'll be
the best thing for him.

983
01:15:10,104 --> 01:15:12,273
It's a structured environment.

984
01:15:18,112 --> 01:15:19,679
His attitude will
definitely change

985
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:21,648
within the first two weeks,

986
01:15:21,649 --> 01:15:24,917
and they'll keep him till
he's ready for society again.

987
01:15:24,918 --> 01:15:27,054
I do think it'll be
the best thing for him,

988
01:15:27,055 --> 01:15:29,477
but it still breaks my heart
that he has to go.

989
01:15:34,295 --> 01:15:38,465
That's my baby.

990
01:15:38,466 --> 01:15:40,868
But I've done everything
I can for him.

991
01:16:32,654 --> 01:16:34,987
I feel bad because
I'm gonna be relieved,

992
01:16:34,988 --> 01:16:37,957
but I don't know.

993
01:16:37,958 --> 01:16:40,494
He's just,
he's hard to deal with.

994
01:16:43,264 --> 01:16:44,930
I love him with all of my heart,

995
01:16:44,931 --> 01:16:47,135
but I need a break.

996
01:17:00,903 --> 01:17:02,482
Guess they cut, they took down

997
01:17:02,483 --> 01:17:06,756
the clothesline pole
I put up last year.

998
01:17:08,613 --> 01:17:10,824
Maybe one of the boys'
friends will come by

999
01:17:11,024 --> 01:17:15,029
and have a crowbar so I
could take the tire off,

1000
01:17:16,029 --> 01:17:19,903
take the wheel and the spindle
and all that off.

1001
01:17:21,903 --> 01:17:24,970
Everything seems to be
all right for today, though,

1002
01:17:24,971 --> 01:17:27,506
except that wheel.

1003
01:17:27,507 --> 01:17:32,478
Just waiting on the tools.

1004
01:17:32,479 --> 01:17:35,614
Andrew wants to get a Charger,

1005
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:40,487
that's what he wants
for his birthday.

1006
01:17:40,488 --> 01:17:45,325
By the time he gets
of age to drive

1007
01:17:45,326 --> 01:17:48,094
no telling what I will have.

1008
01:17:48,095 --> 01:17:52,337
Four wheel drives or
probably some dune buggies.

1009
01:17:57,337 --> 01:18:01,541
Maybe even a four wheeler.

1010
01:18:01,542 --> 01:18:05,711
Good, maybe she has
a four way in her trunk.

1011
01:18:05,712 --> 01:18:07,413
Hey, Andrew, ask her if
she's got a four way

1012
01:18:07,414 --> 01:18:08,415
in the trunk.

1013
01:18:08,416 --> 01:18:09,416
What?

1014
01:18:09,417 --> 01:18:12,219
Something to take the wheel off.

1015
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:14,554
Mine's in Dina's van.

1016
01:18:14,555 --> 01:18:17,328
If she got time.

1017
01:18:20,328 --> 01:18:22,929
I forgot it was in there.

1018
01:18:22,930 --> 01:18:26,767
No.

1019
01:18:26,768 --> 01:18:30,737
Well, I'll just have to
do it later.

1020
01:18:30,738 --> 01:18:32,305
Come here.

1021
01:18:46,654 --> 01:18:47,754
I don't think I like him

1022
01:18:47,954 --> 01:18:50,422
running with this new crowd

1023
01:18:50,423 --> 01:18:53,926
that he's starting
to hang around with.

1024
01:18:53,927 --> 01:18:58,197
He's getting distant.

1025
01:18:58,198 --> 01:19:02,269
Getting distant.

1026
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:05,489
Kids are hard headed.

1027
01:19:22,489 --> 01:19:24,590
My dad,

1028
01:19:24,591 --> 01:19:27,827
he has goals that he
wants to achieve in life

1029
01:19:27,828 --> 01:19:31,730
and I'm kinda
right there with him,

1030
01:19:31,731 --> 01:19:35,468
wanting to help him, you know?

1031
01:19:35,469 --> 01:19:39,438
All he really wants
is someone to be proud.

1032
01:19:39,439 --> 01:19:41,508
And I don't think
that he understands

1033
01:19:41,509 --> 01:19:43,376
that I'm proud of him
whether or not

1034
01:19:43,377 --> 01:19:45,478
he does anything, you know?

1035
01:19:45,479 --> 01:19:47,314
Just get on it.

1036
01:20:05,365 --> 01:20:09,301
I know that my dad's gonna
end up finding a decent place.

1037
01:20:09,302 --> 01:20:11,337
I mean, we might end up
moving a couple more times,

1038
01:20:11,338 --> 01:20:15,774
but I'm gonna be
settling down somewhere.

1039
01:20:15,775 --> 01:20:18,012
I don't know where yet,
but, I will.

1040
01:20:23,484 --> 01:20:24,751
I don't know.

1041
01:20:24,752 --> 01:20:26,920
You can't ever plan the future.

1042
01:20:26,921 --> 01:20:28,121
I've always thought
that I could,

1043
01:20:28,122 --> 01:20:32,325
but it don't work like that.

1044
01:20:32,326 --> 01:20:35,194
Keep practicing.

1045
01:20:35,195 --> 01:20:36,362
Dear Mom.

1046
01:20:36,363 --> 01:20:40,032
I've been out of school a month.

1047
01:20:40,033 --> 01:20:43,435
I broke my neck.

1048
01:20:43,436 --> 01:20:45,371
Just kidding.

1049
01:20:45,372 --> 01:20:48,742
The principal said that
I ain't getting

1050
01:20:48,743 --> 01:20:50,844
any credits for this semester

1051
01:20:50,845 --> 01:20:53,979
so they unenrolled me.

1052
01:20:53,980 --> 01:20:56,683
No, I don't have
a girlfriend yet.

1053
01:20:56,684 --> 01:20:58,518
Big capital letters.

1054
01:20:58,519 --> 01:21:01,955
Love ya, from Harley.

1055
01:21:01,956 --> 01:21:06,626
Um, what did I do
with those stamps?

1056
01:21:06,627 --> 01:21:10,663
Oh, God, please tell me...

1057
01:21:10,664 --> 01:21:13,332
Can I put it upside down

1058
01:21:13,333 --> 01:21:15,568
and would it matter?

1059
01:21:15,569 --> 01:21:17,202
Does it?

1060
01:21:17,203 --> 01:21:18,806
I'm gonna put it upside down
'cause that's what she did

1061
01:21:19,006 --> 01:21:23,343
to this one.

1062
01:21:23,344 --> 01:21:25,178
I'm gonna put it upside down
'cause that's what she did

1063
01:21:25,179 --> 01:21:27,015
to this one.

1064
01:21:27,731 --> 01:21:29,416
What I do with that other stamp?

1065
01:21:29,417 --> 01:21:32,585
Did anybody see me,
what I did with it?

1066
01:21:32,586 --> 01:21:36,790
I took one off...

1067
01:21:36,791 --> 01:21:39,259
There it is, okay.

1068
01:21:39,260 --> 01:21:41,261
Got it, just in case.

1069
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,101
This one goes back in here.

1070
01:22:22,936 --> 01:22:24,203
Thirty-one, two.

1071
01:22:24,204 --> 01:22:26,305
Thirty-one hundred now,
make it thirty-two.

1072
01:22:26,306 --> 01:22:29,041
Thirty-one, two,
thirty-two,

1073
01:22:29,042 --> 01:22:30,844
thirty-one, are you done?

1074
01:22:30,845 --> 01:22:33,746
We did it last year
and we did it again!

1075
01:22:33,747 --> 01:22:35,814
How about that?

1076
01:22:35,815 --> 01:22:39,786
It's only money.

1077
01:22:39,787 --> 01:22:43,122
Arm wrestle, punk, arm wrestle.

1078
01:22:43,123 --> 01:22:44,924
Oh, no, it's not.

1079
01:22:44,925 --> 01:22:46,893
Don't think so, buddy.

1080
01:22:46,894 --> 01:22:48,561
I don't think so!

1081
01:23:15,622 --> 01:23:16,657
Fire!

1082
01:25:29,055 --> 01:25:33,993
USA, USA, USA,
USA, USA, USA...

1083
01:26:03,056 --> 01:26:05,425
Do you think about
how it will be for your mom

1084
01:26:05,426 --> 01:26:06,792
when she gets out?

1085
01:26:06,793 --> 01:26:10,996
She'll have a job,
she'll have a job.

1086
01:26:10,997 --> 01:26:12,931
Hopefully.

1087
01:26:12,932 --> 01:26:15,934
Why are you so confident?

1088
01:26:15,935 --> 01:26:20,439
'Cause it's my mom,
I gotta have some confidence.

1089
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:22,274
What, you're not
laughing no more?

1090
01:26:22,275 --> 01:26:25,111
I gotta tell some jokes
for you to laugh,

1091
01:26:25,112 --> 01:26:27,546
looking at me through the lens

1092
01:26:27,547 --> 01:26:31,451
like it's some special
lens or something.

1093
01:26:31,452 --> 01:26:35,520
It's just a special face
behind the lens.

1094
01:26:35,521 --> 01:26:40,492
Yeah, see, there you go, laugh.

1095
01:26:40,493 --> 01:26:44,964
Boom!

1096
01:26:44,965 --> 01:26:47,634
Yeah, I'm a smart kid.

1097
01:26:47,635 --> 01:26:49,801
I might not be book smart,
but I got a lot

1098
01:26:49,802 --> 01:26:53,038
of street knowledge.

1099
01:26:53,039 --> 01:26:55,608
Maybe not a lot, a lot,

1100
01:26:55,609 --> 01:26:58,077
but I got some.

1101
01:26:58,078 --> 01:27:01,714
Oh, this is my bus.

1102
01:27:01,715 --> 01:27:03,049
Bye.

1103
01:27:03,050 --> 01:27:04,082
Love you.

1104
01:27:04,083 --> 01:27:06,152
I'll see you tonight.

1105
01:27:06,153 --> 01:27:07,519
I'll see you all later.

1106
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:09,488
Are you gonna be at school?

1107
01:27:09,489 --> 01:27:11,456
Maybe.

1108
01:27:11,457 --> 01:27:14,627
You're gonna go back
