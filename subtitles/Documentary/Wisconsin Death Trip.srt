1
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,120 
Congratulations,
Hudson High Class of 2004.

2
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,120 
There she is. Fiona!

3
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,440 
Bye.

4
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,960 
- Hey.
- Hey!

5
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,080 
- Hey, you.

6
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,600 
- Congratulations, graduate.
- Thanks, baby.

7
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,480 
And congratulations to you, Cooper.

8
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,280 
Aww. Thanks, baby!

9
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,320 
- Nice try.
- All right.

10
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,120 
- See you at Wade's party tonight?
- See you then.

11
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,280 
So, it's just you and me
for the entire summer.

12
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,960 
Next year you graduate, join me
at college. Just like we planned.

13
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,480 
- Scott, we need to talk.
- Yeah? About what?

14
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,800 
About me dumping you.

15
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,120 
Huh?

16
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,480 
There he is!

17
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,280 
The graduate
and his beautiful girlfriend. OK?

18
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,000 
Smile, you two!

19
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,160 
- Action!
- Dad, Mom, Grandma...

20
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,080 
Uncle Moke... uh...

21
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,480 
I'm gonna need a minute here, OK?

22
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,520 
What do you mean,
you're dumping me?

23
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,200 
I just can't take all the lying
and cheating on each other anymore.

24
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,560 
What are you talking about?
Sweetie, I never cheated on you.

25
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,680 
I know. That's what makes this so hard.

26
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,600 
You're looking good, you guys.

27
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,080 
Scotty, it's not you.
It's me.

28
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,480 
There I go, lying again.
No, it was you.

29
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,560 
You're just so...

30
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,960 
...predictable.
- Smile!

31
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,880 
So, that's it.

32
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,760 
Here's your letter jacket back.

33
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,320 
Goodbye.

34
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,200 
This isn't mine.

35
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,280 
She's a keeper, huh?
Oh, wow.

36
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,480 
Oh, my God.

37
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,160 
Fiona!

38
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,680 
Let's see that again.

39
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,240 
Fiona!

40
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,800 
- This is just so brutal.

41
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,200 
And yet I can't look away.
Bert, play it again. Come on.

42
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,400 
- Fiona!
- Bert, get out of here.

43
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,600 
OK.See you.

44
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,520 
All right. Stay black, Bert.

45
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,600 
"Fiona!"

46
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,600 
Mail, motherfucker!

47
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,480 
Hey, I got one from Mieke.

48
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,760 
"Happy Herzlichen."

49
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,120 
Still writing that guy?
I thought that was for German class.

50
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,280 
Yeah at first, but we're
actually becoming good friends.

51
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,400 
He's a really cool guy.

52
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:01,840 
"Dear Mieke, greetings
from your American pen pal."

53
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,480 
Scotty, Girl Scouts have pen pals.

54
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,680 
Listen to yourself, all right?

55
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:12,040 
You met a "cool guy" on the "internet."
This is how these sexual predators work.

56
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,080 
Next thing you know,
he'll want to "arrange a meeting"

57
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,280 
where he will gas you,
stuff you in the back of his van,

58
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,120 
and make a wind chime
out of your genitals.

59
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,720 
Come on, let's go to Wade's.

60
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,240 
All right.
Screw it. Let's go.

61
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,960 
I'm not gonna let Fiona
ruin my graduation night.

62
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,000 
Auf wiedersehen, Mieke.

63
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,360 
- What's up, losers?
- What's up, Jenny?

64
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,880 
What's up, dude?

65
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,000 
Sorry to hear about Fiona.
She's a whore.

66
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,880 
That's very sweet of you.
Thanks.

67
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,320 
Enough Fiona talk. Look around.
There's gotta be 100 drunk girls.

68
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,880 
We should try to have sex
with every one of 'em.

69
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,880 
Hello? Mixed company?

70
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,360 
What?

71
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,120 
- I'm a girl!
- No, you're not.

72
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,120 
- You're just a cool guy with long hair.
- So, where's your evil twin brother?

73
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,120 
Jenny!

74
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,640 
There he is.

75
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,120 
Hey, Jamie.
In fine form, I see.

76
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,400 
Why'd you get me
gin and tonic?

77
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,080 
- I hate gin.
- You do?

78
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,000 
You guys are the worst twins ever!

79
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,480 
Chug! Chug!

80
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,960 
- When are you guys taking off?
- Tomorrow morning.

81
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,760 
Hey, Wade!
Great party, buddy.

82
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,280 
Man, I am so excited!

83
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,840 
A whole summer,
backpacking around Europe.

84
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,760 
You should've come with us instead of
working for Dr. Dad, Scotty!

85
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,240 
It's gonna be so awesome!

86
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:53,520 
Yeah. I planned every detail of the trip
to maximize the fun!

87
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,640 
You brought a guidebook to a party?

88
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,880 
- Do you wanna see my itinerary?
- Do you wanna see my balls?

89
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,320 
You guys decide where
you're gonna go first?

90
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,080 
Paris! I can't wait.

91
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,840 
Two years ago Nicky Jager's sister,
Debbie, met a wealthy French guy,

92
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,920 
and spent a month sailing
the Mediterranean on his yacht.

93
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,960 
Isn't that the most romantic
thing you've ever heard?

94
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:19,680 
Stuck on a boat with a weird French guy?
That sounds a little gay.

95
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,000 
It's not gay. I'm a girl.

96
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,840 
- Kinda gay.
- A little gay.

97
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,960 
I gotta piss like a pregnant woman.

98
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,760 
Hey, listen up, everybody.

99
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,280 
Gotta a little special thing
I'd like to do tonight.

100
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,800 
Going to play
a little song for you

101
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,200 
about the nastiest, freakiest
little sex puppet I know...

102
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,080 
Fiona.

103
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,040 
This one's for you, baby.
Happy anniversary.

104
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,120 
" Scotty doesn't know
That Fiona and me

105
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,680 
" Do it in my van every Sunday

106
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,600 
" She tells him she's in church
But she doesn't go

107
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,600 
" Still she's on her knees
And Scotty doesn't know

108
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,760 
" Oh, Scotty doesn't know

109
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,720 
" So don't tell Scotty
Scotty doesn't know

110
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,040 
" Scotty doesn't know "

111
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,080 
I hope we're just as popular
in college as we were in high school.

112
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,160 
- We will be.
- I know.

113
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,200 
Who needs more Chablis?

114
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,360 
- Candy, wanna come with?
- No, I'll stay here.

115
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,800 
Well, there's your R-rating
right there.

116
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,040 
- Whoops!

117
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,120 
Holy cow!

118
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,840 
Oh, this isn't where
I parked my car!

119
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,080 
" I can't believe
He's so trusting

120
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,840 
" While I'm right behind you thrusting

121
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,560 
" 'Cause Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know "

122
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,360 
Cooper Harris, you're a pig!

123
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,680 
Uh... Candy, you should
clean that off before you go.

124
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,480 
Clean what off?

125
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,360 
You got a little something on you.

126
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,240 
- Where?
- Right there.

127
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,200 
It's like a smudge,
or something.

128
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,840 
Where?

129
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,560 
It's like dirt, or something.
Just go like this.

130
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,000 
Is it off?

131
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,880 
No, keep rubbing it.

132
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,600 
" I did it with her on his birthday

133
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,240 
" Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know

134
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,480 
" Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know

135
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,040 
" Don't tell Scotty
Scotty doesn't know "

136
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,320 
Mmm-hmm... mmm-hmm...

137
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,120 
No, it's just not coming off.

138
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,720 
What is it?

139
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,080 
Maybe tree sap or something.
Try pinching it.

140
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,800 
No, it's just not coming off.
I'll tell you what.

141
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,200 
Lick your fingers,
get some saliva going.

142
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,600 
Like this?

143
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,120 
Yeah.

144
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,800 
Again, not enough saliva.

145
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,120 
- Is it off yet?
- Fine, I'll do it.

146
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,600 
Come here.

147
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,400 
Oh, my God! Candy!

148
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,080 
Cooper!

149
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,040 
Hey...

150
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,120 
This isn't where I parked my car.

151
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,640 
" Scotty doesn't know

152
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,200 
Hey.

153
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:05,600 
Scotty doesn't know!
Scotty doesn't know!

154
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,600 
This band rocks!

155
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,640 
- Yeah!

156
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,360 
Mail, motherfucker!

157
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,120 
Hey, Mieke.

158
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,600 
"Dear Scott,

159
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:50,240 
"I was very sad to hear about
your lady woman Fiona dumping you.

160
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,040 
"Since you no longer have a girlfriend,
maybe I could come to America

161
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,560 
"and we could get to know each
other better. Perhaps we could...

162
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,680 
"zussamen."

163
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,840 
What the fuck is "zussamen"?

164
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,240 
"Arrange a meeting."

165
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,200 
No, no, no! Come on!
Cooper was right.

166
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,320 
This guy wants to have sex with me.

167
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,040 
"Listen, Mieke...

168
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,800 
"I don't want to arrange
any meetings with you,

169
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,600 
"you sick, German freak.

170
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,920 
"So please keep your hands
off my genitals,

171
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,520 
"and never write to me again,
and don't come to America."

172
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,480 
"Goodbye."

173
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,920 
Oww.

174
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,160 
I'm never drinking again.
Oh, that's nice.

175
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,440 
Bert, what are you doing?

176
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,120 
Reading your email.

177
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,200 
Don't do that.

178
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,760 
Why are you wearing my bathrobe?

179
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,920 
Oh, I'm sorry...

180
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,320 
but somebody pissed
all over mine last night.

181
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,520 
Wow. I can't believe this German chick
wants to come here and hook up with you.

182
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,080 
I don't think so, buddy.
Mieke's a guy.

183
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,160 
No, it says right here,
"trauriges madchen."

184
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,840 
"I was a sad girl to hear about Fiona."

185
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,280 
Fuckin' A, Scott.

186
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,280 
I'm taking "Intro to German,"
and even I know that.

187
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,680 
Come here.

188
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,760 
He sent me a picture, retardo.

189
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,600 
See? That's a picture of Mieke
and his cute cousin, Jan.

190
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,400 
No, retardo.

191
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,320 
That's Jan, a man's name,
and that's not "Mike,"

192
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,240 
it's "Mieke," a common
German girl's name,

193
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,160 
similar to our Michelle.

194
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,800 
I hope you wrote her back
and told her to come visit.

195
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,400 
You didn't?

196
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,760 
You thought she was a guy!

197
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,920 
I'm getting the video camera! Ha!

198
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,800 
What an asshole!

199
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,400 
No.

200
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,680 
No.

201
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,920 
No!!

202
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,200 
"Address blocked"?
"Email not delivered."

203
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,400 
No... come on!

204
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,720 
Hey, Mom made waffles.

205
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,240 
- What's going on?
- I'm in love with my penpal.

206
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,240 
I'm in love with Mieke.

207
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,240 
OK... OK.

208
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,400 
You know what?
I was actually expecting this.

209
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,480 
Frankly, I'm flattered
you picked me to come out to first.

210
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,480 
And don't worry about
telling your folks, 'cause...

211
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,720 
- I think they already know.
- No, you idiot. Mike is a girl.

212
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,240 
No, no, I get it. Yeah.

213
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:27,960 
He's the girl, and you're the girl,
and sometimes you're both the girl.

214
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,760 
Right?

215
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,200 
Right? That's hot.

216
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,760 
But whatever works for you.
I'm not gonna judge it.

217
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,760 
Will you stop? Look, come here.
Look at this picture.

218
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,840 
Wow. Who's the hot chick?

219
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,040 
That's "Mike." I mean, Mieke.

220
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,120 
That's who you've been writing to
all this time?

221
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,480 
Until last night,
when I took your advice

222
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,120 
and told her to keep her
"hands off my genitals."

223
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:58,160 
Given what we know now, that seems like
the exact opposite of what you want.

224
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,400 
This is a total disaster.

225
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,520 
Oh, come on. It's not that bad.

226
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,120 
Though she is really hot.

227
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,520 
You're not listening.
I don't even care what she looks like.

228
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,880 
Mieke and I had this incredible bond.

229
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,520 
I told her things
I couldn't even tell you.

230
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,040 
Like what?

231
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,080 
- Nothing. It's a figure of speech.
- No, seriously. What?

232
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,920 
- Nothing. The point...
- You like me better, right?

233
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,920 
This girl is not only smart and funny,
and stunningly beautiful,

234
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,480 
but until I screwed up, she wanted
to come all the way to America,

235
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,760 
just to be with me.

236
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,920 
- So do something about it.
- What can I do?

237
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,160 
She blocked her email account,
her phone number's not listed.

238
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,520 
The only thing I know
is she lives in Berlin.

239
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,040 
So go to Berlin.

240
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,960 
I can't just go to Berlin, Coop.

241
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,000 
- Why not?
- Because...

242
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,800 
I just can't, OK? I'm supposed
to work for my dad this summer.

243
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,280 
It looks good on
my med school application.

244
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,160 
Oh, Jesus, Scotty!

245
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,280 
Man, Fiona was right.
You're so predictable.

246
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,240 
- I'm going to Germany.
- No...

247
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,680 
we're going to Germany.

248
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,320 
How are we going
to get to Germany?

249
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,880 
Don't worry. I've got it covered.

250
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,400 
- We're going to be couriers?
- Best way to get a cheap flight.

251
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,240 
We just have to carry their packages,
then drop them off when we get there.

252
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,280 
- My cousin did it going to India.
- Yeah?

253
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,840 
Of course, he ended up using
a public restroom in New Delhi

254
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,360 
and they had to cut off his leg.
You know...

255
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,320 
but he got there cheap,
is what I'm saying.

256
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,600 
OK, I don't have anything
to Germany for a week.

257
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,840 
But I can get you both
to London today for $118.

258
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,920 
Anything else?

259
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,800 
Europe is the size of the Eastwood Mall.
We can walk to Berlin from there.

260
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,400 
- Cooper, England's an island.
- OK, swim. Whatever.

261
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,520 
We'll take it.

262
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,760 
Hey. Thanks for coming with me.

263
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,800 
I know you had that internship
at the law firm this summer.

264
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,280 
Well, forget about the law firm.

265
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,760 
And don't thank me.
I should be thanking you.

266
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,440 
This trip is
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

267
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,080 
for me to broaden my sexual horizons.

268
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,680 
What are you talking about?

269
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,000 
I'm talking about crazy European sex.

270
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,560 
Ah.

271
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,640 
You know America was founded by prudes.

272
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,200 
Prudes who left Europe,
because they hated

273
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,480 
all the kinky, steamy
European sex that was going on.

274
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:01,000 
And now I, Cooper Harris,

275
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,240 
will return to the land
of my perverted forefathers

276
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,280 
and claim my birthright,
which is a series

277
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,640 
of erotic and sexually
challenging adventures.

278
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,680 
You've really thought a lot
about this, haven't you?

279
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,480 
It's my passion.

280
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,080 
Come on, come on!

281
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:41,680 
- The adventure begins.
- Welcome to jolly old England.

282
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,320 
Yeah, breathe that sweet,
sexy, European air.

283
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,320 
- Oh.
- What is that?

284
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,120 
It's the phone they gave me
at the law firm.

285
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,800 
Yeah, it's pretty neat, huh?

286
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,480 
- Works anywhere.
- Yeah?

287
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,200 
Excuse me.

288
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,160 
Cooper here.

289
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,160 
Hello, Mr. Walters.

290
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,280 
Yes, sir, I'm down in file storage.

291
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,200 
Um, hang on one second.

292
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,600 
No, sir, I can't find
the Gutterman file anywhere.

293
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,240 
Yes, sir, I'll keep looking.

294
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,200 
I don't rest until I find it.

295
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,920 
Didn't tell your boss
you were leaving the country?

296
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,120 
They would've stopped paying me.
It seemed easier.

297
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,160 
- So, where to?
- I don't know.

298
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,040 
First bus to Berlin doesn't leave
till tomorrow. What do you wanna do?

299
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,680 
Got the Tower of London...
there's Buckingham Palace.

300
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,760 
- Uh...
- There's no drinking age.

301
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,680 
- There you go!
- Come on.

302
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,840 
- Hey!"The Fiesty Goat."

303
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,240 
All right!

304
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,120 
What do you wanna...

305
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,960 
Soccer hooligans.

306
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,000 
Hey, this isn't where
I parked my car!

307
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,360 
Oy!

308
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,560 
Who the bloody hell are you?

309
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:21,000 
This is a private members bar,
exclusively for the supporters

310
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,040 
of the greatest
football team in the world...

311
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,640 
Manchester United.

312
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,880 
Now please, enlighten me.

313
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,480 
Who the fuck are you?!

314
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:35,520 
That is a good question,
and... Scotty?

315
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,120 
Huh?

316
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,640 
We're the Manchester United fan club...

317
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,520 
from Ohio.

318
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,240 
If you're Manchester United
supporters...

319
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,040 
sing the Manchester United song.

320
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,560 
Excuse me, I'm sorry.
I'm not much of a singer...

321
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,520 
- Sing!!
- " My baby takes

322
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,640 
" The morning train

323
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:05,000 
" He works from 9 to 5 and then

324
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,800 
" He takes another home again

325
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,200 
" To find me...

326
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,560 
" watching the Manchester United
football team! "

327
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,120 
Eh?

328
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,680 
The best freakin' team
in all the land! Whoo-hoo!

329
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,720 
Pretty good.

330
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,040 
- Pretty dang good, lads!
- Yeah!

331
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:44,960 
" My baby takes the morning train

332
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,080 
" He works from 9 to 5 and then

00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,840 
" He takes another home again

334
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,720 
" To find me waiting for him

335
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:01,080 
" He's always
on that morning train "

336
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,040 
I've unblocked
your email address,

337
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,120 
but this Scott is not responding.

338
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,360 
He was the one.

339
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,600 
I was going to give myself to him.

340
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,640 
Perhaps you should give
yourself to someone else...

341
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,800 
fraulein.

342
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,120 
I'm never drinking again.

343
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,720 
Coop, wake up.

344
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,440 
Oh, man, that was a wild night.

345
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,800 
You think?

346
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,440 
Scotty, where the hell are we going?

347
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:12,480 
Don't worry. If anything
bad happens, my parents will find us.

348
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,680 
Honey, where's Scotty?

349
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,600 
- Cooper said they were going camping.
- Oh, that's nice.

350
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,400 
And where's Bert?

351
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,760 
Fuck if I know.

352
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:38,480 
Hey!
How are you, you scalawag!

353
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,120 
Look, given the current
geopolitical climate,

354
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,240 
all European countries should
have a seat at the table.

355
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,800 
- Right.
- Except those fucking Ities.

356
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,120 
I hate them Italian bastards.

357
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,160 
- You know what I mean?
- Excuse me.

358
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,560 
Hello, boyo!

359
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,880 
- What the hell happened last night?
- You got steamed up, pissed as a fart.

360
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,720 
Too much sauce, son.

361
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,040 
Don't worry.

362
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,000 
We come and got ya,
so you wouldn't miss the trip.

363
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,800 
What trip?

364
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,160 
- Where are we going?
- What do you mean, where are we going?

365
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,280 
We're going to see the Mighty
Reds do the frogs in Paris.

366
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,320 
Aren't we, boys?

367
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,040 
Yeah!

368
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,840 
Why are you yelling at me?

369
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,320 
So I tell the swamp donkey
to sock it

370
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,360 
before I give her a trunky
in the tradesman's entrance

371
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,800 
and have her lick me yardballs!

372
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:31,600 
Wow. You guys are on a completely
different level of swearing over here.

373
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,680 
Coop? Cooper,
we're going to Paris.

374
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,280 
I know. Cecil told me.

375
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,000 
Mieke's in Berlin.
We're not going to Berlin.

376
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,040 
What are we gonna do?
We need a plan.

377
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,840 
See what I'm talking about?
This is predictable Scotty talking.

378
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,680 
Relax. Paris is practically a suburb
of Berlin. It's a nothing commute.

379
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,360 
That's why France and Germany
have always been allies.

380
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,560 
The twins.
The twins are in Paris, right?

381
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,560 
We can call them. They could help.
Let me see your phone.

382
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,840 
Okay, but I'm only supposed
to use this for business calls.

383
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,720 
Hey, don't...

384
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,080 
You're on the wrong side of the road,

385
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,960 
you snail-eating puffs.

386
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:32,120 
Fuck off! Go on, you Gaelic
fucking garlic-breath tossers!

387
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,360 
Piss off!
Get in here and say that,

388
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,760 
you froggy Itie shities!

389
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,160 
- Fucking beep!

390
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,280 
We'll beep, you bastard,
all over your fucking nose!

391
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,320 
Get out of the way! Piss off!

392
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,640 
Hey, lads!

393
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,320 
That wanker's got
a frog football shirt on!

394
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,840 
Let's give this nancy
a fucking good kicking!

395
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,320 
Come on, lads, he's going off!

396
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,280 
All right. Twins said
they'd meet us here.

397
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,280 
Look at that!

398
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,280 
There they are. Come on. Jenny!

399
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,480 
- Jamie!
- Hey!

400
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,560 
Come here!

401
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,720 
No, no. No, no, no!

402
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,480 
- Scott, bienvenu a Paris.
- Thank you.

403
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,080 
- Is that a new camera?
- It isn't just a camera,

404
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,120 
this is a Leica M7.

405
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,280 
Uber-sensitive exposure settings,

406
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,120 
legendary cloth shutter system.

407
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,840 
- Let me see that thing.
- No can do.

408
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,960 
I spent four years tutoring
lacrosse players to pay for it,

409
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,040 
so nobody touches my camera but me.

410
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,400 
- It's like your wiener.
- No, it's not...

411
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,520 
- Jenny...
- Cooper, leave him alone.

412
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,040 
Wow, I can't believe you came
all the way to Europe for a girl.

413
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,800 
Wait, not just any girl.

414
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,440 
Show her the picture, Scotty.

415
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,320 
She makes girls in our high school
look like walruses.

416
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,560 
I'm a girl from your high school.

417
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,120 
No, I mean "girl" girls.

418
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,000 
Guys, we're wasting the whole day here.
We're in Paris!

419
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,480 
Let's go to the Louvre!

420
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,400 
To the Louvre!

421
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,680 
So, you guys wanna stay here,

422
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,640 
or should we check out
the huge line at the Eiffel Tower?

423
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:57,680 
Here's a fun fact. Voltaire contracted
syphilis two blocks from here.

424
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,040 
- Should we go?
- Can we please get out of here?

425
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,120 
- This guy's really creeping me out.
- Who, robot man?

426
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,160 
He's just trying to feed
his robot family.

427
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,400 
- I really don't like him.
- Why?

428
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,800 
Because he's doing this?

429
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,640 
OK, seriously, don't do that.

430
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,920 
Cooper.
Do not hate me.

431
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,960 
I am familiar with
over 600 dance moves

432
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,120 
and I am programmed to get...

433
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,360 
freaky.

434
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,680 
You're just upset because
people like me better.

435
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,720 
It's okay.

436
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,480 
Oh!

437
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,040 
Fight! Fight!

438
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,800 
Break the leg shot!

439
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,440 
Ha! Ha! Ha!

440
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,560 
Don't look in his eyes, Scotty.

441
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,520 
- Ohhh!
- That was not cool.

442
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,400 
- Oh!

443
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,400 
Guys, let's go. Come on.

444
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,800 
Error! Error! Error!

445
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,640 
How cool is this?

446
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,400 
It's a shame we only get
to spend one day together.

447
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,120 
- Why don't you come to Berlin?
- Umm, no.

448
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,440 
Jamie, come on. In a few months,
we go to different colleges.

449
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:55,120 
This could be the last chance the four
of us are together like this.

450
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,080 
Plus, we're in Europe. Huh?

451
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,240 
This should be the trip of a lifetime.

452
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,560 
There's no way we should split up.

453
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:05,080 
All right, this table
is now Europe, OK?

454
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,560 
Excuse me.

455
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,960 
We are right here, in Paris,

456
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,200 
and I have got to get to Mieke,

457
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,600 
who is over here, in Berlin.

458
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:18,640 
If you come with us,
I'm sure there's a ton of great stuff

459
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,800 
to see along the way.

460
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:24,040 
- We can go to Denmark.
- I love Denmark.

461
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,560 
- We gotta hit Amsterdam.
- Definitely.

462
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,440 
And the cathedral at Cameret!

463
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,720 
- Yeah...
- Maybe. We'll see.

464
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,800 
- Whatever.
- If there's time.

465
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:40,120 
Come on! I really want you
to be there when I meet Mieke.

466
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,320 
Fine.

467
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,120 
- Excellent!
- All right!

468
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,160 
- A toast!
- Yes!

469
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,320 
- To Mieke!
- To Europe!

470
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,800 
To Europe!

471
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,560 
Merci.

472
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,560 
- Berlin, here we come!
- All right.

473
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,200 
Better let me hold on to those.

474
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:05,200 
- What the hell is that?
- It's a traveler's money belt.

475
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,520 
Frommer's says
if you have one of these,

476
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,360 
no one can rob you of anything.

477
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,920 
Except your dignity.

478
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,600 
No, you just put that in your...

479
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,000 
wait, what?

480
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,520 
Come on, guidebook. Let's go.

481
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,560 
Check it out.

482
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,160 
European ass.

483
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,800 
What's up?

484
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,040 
Jesus, Jenny.
I thought you were some...

485
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,720 
girl. Come on. Platform 4.

486
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,920 
Thanks.

487
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,560 
Damn!

488
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,400 
I believe this is yours.

489
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,520 
Pleased to meet you.
My name is Christoph.

490
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,200 
- Jenny, let's go!
- Move it!

491
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,240 
Those are my friends.
We're supposed to go to Berlin...

492
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,880 
- Jenny!
- I'm coming!!

493
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,360 
So, it was really nice
to meet you.

494
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,400 
The pleasure was all mine...

495
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,920 
Jennifer.

496
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,480 
" Scotty doesn't know
That Fiona and me "

497
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,520 
" Do it in my van on Sundays "

498
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,000 
" Tells him she's... "
What?

499
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:07,440 
You gotta admit,
it's a really catchy tune.

500
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,840 
" Tells him she's in church
But she doesn't go "

501
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,280 
" Still she's on her knees
And Scotty doesn't know "

502
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,040 
" Scotty doesn't know "

503
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,040 
- " Scotty doesn't... "
- Buongiorno.

504
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,160 
Buongiorno.

505
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,080 
You know, there are a lot
of other empty compartments.

506
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,640 
Huh?

507
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,880 
Ah! Si...

508
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,480 
Si.

509
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,880 
Pardon me.

510
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,080 
Eh?

511
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,080 
Ohhh...

512
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,640 
Scusi.

513
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,680 
Mi scusi.

514
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,480 
Hi.

515
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,240 
Buongiorno.

516
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:08,520 
- What the hell are you doing?
- Mi scusi, mi scusi.

517
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,920 
No! No, no, no!

518
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,080 
- Uh-oh.
- What?

519
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,160 
Big tunnel.

520
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,400 
Who's touching me?
Scotty, is that you?

521
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,280 
Who's touching me?! Scotty!

522
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,400 
Oh!

523
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,320 
Scusi.

524
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,080 
Buongiorno.

525
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,360 
Crans Sur Mer.
We change trains here.

526
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,840 
Well, we got a couple
of hours to kill.

527
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,600 
What's there to see in this town?

528
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,760 
Hello? The Monument des Poissonieres.

529
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,080 
It's a monument to all the local
fishermen who were lost at sea.

530
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,280 
Frommer's says it's supposed
to be..."quite moving."

531
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,320 
What the hell is wrong with you, C-3PO?

532
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,160 
We're here to see Europe,
not some crappy statue.

533
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,160 
I'm taking a nap.

534
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,280 
Wake me up when the train gets here.

535
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,520 
Hmm. Says here this town
has a famous nude beach.

536
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,400 
All right, we can't all
just lie around all day.

537
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,280 
We gotta experience
the culture firsthand.

538
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,520 
Let's go exploring!

539
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,680 
So, what's the etiquette on boners?

540
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,680 
Do I roll over and dig out
a hole for it,

541
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,680 
or is it cool to just let my flag fly?

542
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,200 
Wait, wait.

543
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,920 
Does "nude beach" mean
we have to get naked, too?

544
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,640 
Of course.

545
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,240 
Do you think you can go an hour

546
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,320 
without your currency colostomy bag?

547
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,600 
As long as this thing has
our money and passports in it,

548
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:15,280 
it's not coming off, and
my trunks won't come off, either.

549
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,720 
Come on.

550
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,920 
You came all the way to Europe.

551
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,760 
Can't wimp out now.

552
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,040 
OK.

553
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,840 
All right, on the count of three.

554
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,040 
Here we go.

555
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,640 
3,2,1...

556
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,520 
Look at Jamie's penis!

557
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,440 
Very funny. Very funny.

558
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,720 
All right.

559
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,400 
Let the crazy European
sex odyssey begin.

560
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,680 
- Here we go.
- Really?

561
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,000 
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

562
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:48,680 
- Hello, ladies!

563
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:57,000 
- Ladies?
- Bitches?

564
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,520 
Eww! What a rip!
There's no nude girls here,

565
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,720 
Just guys like us
looking for nude girls.

566
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,040 
I don't understand.

567
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:14,360 
"Crans Sur Mer has one of the best
nude beaches on the continent.

568
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,920 
"However...

569
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,120 
"during the summer,
the European women

570
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,680 
"are chased away
by gawking male tourists,

571
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,600 
"so Europe's most nubile exhibitionists
head to the deserted beach

572
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,000 
"next to the Monument des Poissonieres."

573
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:49,080 
There's so many penises.

574
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:52,600 
Frommer's tried to tell you,
but you just didn't listen.

575
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,880 
This is the biggest
sausage fest on earth.

576
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,480 
It's the international house of sausage.

577
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,920 
Hey!

578
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,720 
- Thanks for waiting.
- You're not missing anything.

579
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,240 
It's all guys.

580
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:08,240 
At least the sun's out.

581
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,400 
" Dreams come true "

582
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:30,120 
" I made my dreams come true "

583
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,040 
" My dreams come true "

584
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,480 
Holy crap!

585
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,480 
What? I thought this was a nude beach.

586
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,560 
No!!!

587
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,920 
- Huh?
- No.

588
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,040 
- What? What are you doing?
- Jenny, you gotta cover up.

589
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,880 
Girl?

590
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,080 
Girl!

591
00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:00,040 
Ooh, girl.
Girl... girl.

592
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,880 
Girl... girl...

593
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,200 
Run!

594
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,240 
- I'm not gonna make it.

595
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,840 
- Go on without me.
- All right. See ya.

596
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,000 
Chica! Chica!

597
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,480 
Chica! Chica!

598
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,440 
Reading Mieke's old emails again?

599
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,040 
Yeah.

600
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:49,520 
I have no idea what I'm going
to say to that girl when I see her.

601
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,040 
You know, she said
I might be the one?

602
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,720 
That's huge.

603
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,320 
I've never been "the one" before.

604
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:03,120 
Thought I was "the one" with Fiona,
but turns out I was, what, 101?

605
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,720 
- 200.
- 200!

606
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,160 
Look, you got nothing to worry about.

607
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,680 
You'll show up and sweep her
off her German feet.

608
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,040 
Thanks.

609
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,520 
Yeah.

610
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,720 
I will, won't I?

611
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,400 
I'm so sad and lonely.

612
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,000 
I'm so sad and lonely.

613
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,400 
I just wish someone
would show up

614
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,160 
and sweep me off
my German feet.

615
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,920 
Mieke! I'm here.

616
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,600 
Scotty!

617
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,680 
About that last email.
I'm so sorry...

618
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,920 
The past is the past.
You're here now.

619
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,720 
I've been saving myself for you.

620
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,320 
Let us make love
for one whole month.

621
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,800 
Touch me, Scotty.

622
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:04,480 
OK.

623
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,520 
Oh, Scott...

624
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,400 
- Mi bello.

625
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,200 
Mi bello.

626
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,720 
Mi bello.

627
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,720 
Mi bello.

628
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,800 
Mi bello.

629
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,400 
Mi scusi.

630
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:53,160 
Mi scusi!

631
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:56,360 
" Hot stuff baby this evening "

632
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,440 
" Gotta have some hot stuff "

633
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:01,440 
" Gotta have some love tonight "

634
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,800 
" Hot stuff "

635
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,600 
Guys, our train
doesn't leave till morning.

636
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,680 
- Where will we sleep?
- What do you mean, sleep?

637
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,880 
We can sleep on the train tomorrow.

638
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:31,240 
This is the best that could've happened.
We're in Amsterdam!

639
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:34,400 
This is the drug and
sex capital of Europe!

640
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,640 
Take a look at this.

641
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:41,240 
"Club Vandersexxx."

642
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:44,280 
"The red light district's
hottest sex club."

643
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:47,040 
We have to check it out.
Who's with me?

644
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,520 
I'll go.

645
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,480 
Fine. Since no one else
is willing to go,

646
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,240 
I'll just go myself.

647
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:11,040 
" I see "

648
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,520 
" You're waiting for me "

649
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:18,400 
This is definitely
where I parked my car.

650
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,480 
Hello there.

651
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,400 
Welcome to Club Vandersexxx...

652
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:29,440 
Amsterdam's most erotic club,

653
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,840 
where your every fantasy
will be fulfilled.

654
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,720 
Also says I get
a free T-shirt with flyer.

655
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,240 
He's American.

656
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:45,440 
How sad for you to grow up
in a country founded by prudes.

657
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:50,040 
A country overrun
with crime and illiteracy.

658
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,800 
A country where a man
is forced to make sex

659
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,800 
to only one woman at a time,

660
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,840 
and one must learn
the woman's name beforehand.

661
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,320 
- It was horrible.
- I know.

662
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,480 
But you can come with me...

663
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:06,600 
and let the Vandersexxx begin.

664
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:14,840 
" Marijuana in my soul "

665
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,840 
" Your iguana in my hall "

666
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,200 
I can't believe
we're doing this.

667
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:23,320 
Don't worry.
Hash brownies are totally legal here.

668
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:27,360 
You're gonna enjoy these, man.
These are magical.

669
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,960 
" I like to smoke marijuana "

670
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,680 
- You wanna do this?
- Yeah.

671
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,520 
- Hi.
- Hi.

672
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,560 
I need a new battery for my camera,

673
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:45,120 
and while you're at it,
it could use a cleaning.

674
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,720 
Wow.

675
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,840 
Is that a Leica M6?

676
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,280 
Actually, it's an M7.

677
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,600 
It's got the built-in light meter.

678
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,840 
It's so beautiful.

679
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,320 
So sleek, so powerful.

680
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,400 
How's the new lens system?

681
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:05,440 
Makes the Nikon
look like a disposable.

682
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,000 
You really know your cameras.

683
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:10,960 
And you're very cute.

684
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,480 
Me? Really?

685
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:15,760 
I'm going on break.

686
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:18,720 
I was going to step out back
and have a cigarette.

687
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,440 
Would you like to join me?

688
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:23,160 
I don't smoke.

689
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:32,640 
Neither do I.

690
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,240 
Hold on, hold on.

691
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:35,960 
What is it?

692
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,520 
This is great!

693
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,720 
You're so innocent.

694
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,720 
Let's change that... shall we?

695
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,080 
What would you like me to do?

696
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,560 
Well... I don't really know...

697
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,800 
I guess I really
haven't done that much.

698
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:56,480 
I haven't really found the time,
with all my extracurriculars,

699
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:00,440 
and model U.N., advanced placement
classes, after-school tutor...

700
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,200 
...ing! Ah!

701
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,880 
Gosh, you really like cameras!

702
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:10,880 
Sometimes, we find our clients are
so overwhelmed with the pleasure,

703
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,680 
that they sometimes scream out,"no,"

704
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,600 
when really they mean,"yes."

705
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:20,080 
And this is why we have the safe word.

706
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,800 
The "safe word"?

707
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,080 
If at any time the ecstasy
gets too great,

708
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,400 
you just use the safe word.

709
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:33,040 
Until we hear the safe word,
we will not stop.

710
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,600 
Yeah, right. Stop.
All right.

711
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,760 
We're going to start slowly,

712
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:43,360 
teasing you with a little
light erotic foreplay.

713
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,080 
Whee!

714
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,640 
Oh, yes, ladies!

715
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,280 
On, on, vandersexxx!

716
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,480 
Hans! Gruber!

717
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,600 
Hi.

718
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:19,760 
So, are the girls coming back?

719
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:22,600 
Administer the testicle clamps!

720
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,520 
- Huh? What? Hey!

721
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,920 
Safe word!

722
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:43,120 
What is that?!
That's not a word, it's a...

723
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,960 
"Fluggen-kliggin-kien?"

724
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,560 
Fluggen!!!

725
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,200 
- OK, mister, don't move.
- Excuse me?

726
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,160 
Shut the hell up!

727
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,160 
Oh, brother! Please don't hurt me.

728
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:05,120 
Oh, no... you're fine.
That's good. You're fine.

729
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,360 
Give me cash? You got cash?

730
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,560 
Take it all, you dirty girl.

731
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:10,960 
What?

732
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,440 
Your wallet! Focus!

733
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,840 
- Give it to me.
- Oh!

734
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,720 
Oh, I love you!

735
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,280 
I love you!

736
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:26,080 
I love you! I looove you!

737
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,040 
What's so funny?

738
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:51,560 
I'm really hungry.
I think I've got the munchies.

739
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:54,360 
- Excuse me.
- Huh?

740
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:58,080 
It's hot in here. You hot?
'Cause I'm really hot.

741
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:00,480 
- So good.
- OK, I can't breathe! God!

742
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:04,200 
I'm freaking out! I think we got
a bad batch 'cause I'm freaking out.

743
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,360 
I can't... I can't do this.

744
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,040 
I saw a gay porno once.
I didn't know until halfway in.

745
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:14,280 
The girls never came.
The girls never came!

746
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:17,200 
I am freaking out!!

747
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:21,000 
- Everything all right with you?
- No, nothing's all right.

748
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,200 
You sold us a bad batch
of hash brownies.

749
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,240 
You're a bad Rastafarian.

750
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,880 
These are not hash brownies.

751
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,280 
Hmm?

752
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:34,280 
- What was that?
- We do not sell hash brownies.

753
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,480 
We're a simple Dutch bakery!

754
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:43,160 
Now put your clothes back on, white boy!

755
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:47,200 
Ow! Ow! Ow!

756
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,000 
"Fluggengegeholen!"

757
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,160 
Did you say fluggegecheimen?

758
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:54,240 
Yes! Yes!

759
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:57,000 
For the love of god,
fluggengecheimen!

760
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:58,720 
Are you sure?

761
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,040 
Yes, please.

762
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,160 
As you wish.

763
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,760 
Bring on
the fluggegecheimen!

764
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:11,120 
Wait... what?

765
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,160 
Uh-oh.

766
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:16,480 
No, no, no!
I didn't say fluggegecheimen,

767
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,680 
I said, uh...

768
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:39,400 
What'd you do last night?

769
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,720 
I don't want to talk about it.

770
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:45,200 
What did you guys do?

771
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,320 
Don't want to talk about it.

772
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:53,440 
- What is that?
- Free T-shirt.

773
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,600 
Hey, guys.

774
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,480 
What happened to you?

775
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,200 
I got robbed.

776
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:06,440 
It was awesome!

777
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:12,560 
Our money, passports, tickets...
Everything, gone!

778
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,720 
How the hell could this happen?

779
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:18,880 
We all go to Amsterdam, and
Jamie's the one who hooks up!

780
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,120 
For shame!

781
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:33,200 
Oh, that's me.

782
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:38,000 
Coop here. Sorry.

783
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:40,920 
Hello, Mr. Walters.

784
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,600 
You never got the Gutterman file?

785
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,600 
I told Humphrey to give it to you.

786
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:50,840 
That's hogwash. I handed it
to him myself yesterday.

787
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:54,040 
I'll tell Humphrey to report
to your office immediately.

788
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,120 
Bye.

789
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:00,560 
- This job's killing me.

790
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:13,680 
- Uh...
- Let me handle this.

791
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:16,080 
I speak bad German.

792
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:42,200 
- What did he say?
- He said he's driving.

793
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,480 
- Oh.
- Something.

794
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:45,320 
Jah.

795
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,120 
Berlin?

796
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,760 
- Berlin?
- Berlin!

797
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:09,360 
- He's going to Berlin!
- Awesome!

798
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:14,800 
- All right! Berlin!
- Come on, let's go!

799
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,440 
Next stop, Berlin!

800
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:50,800 
Beautiful!
We made it to Berlin.

801
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:53,000 
Jah. Berlin!

802
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,680 
- Bratislava?
- Yeah.

803
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:01,720 
Bratislava!

804
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:10,480 
Dear sweet mother of God.

805
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:12,680 
We're in Eastern Europe.

806
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,360 
Eww!

807
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,960 
Excuse me.

808
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:43,760 
Do you speak any English?

809
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:46,760 
You are Americans?

810
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,160 
Yeah.

811
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,160 
I love America.

812
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:54,640 
We just get "Miami Vice" on television.

813
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:57,800 
"Miami Vice" is number one new show.

814
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,280 
Yeah.

815
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:02,560 
Listen, we're trying
to get to Berlin, Germany.

816
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:05,360 
Do you know if there's
a train coming anytime soon?

817
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,840 
Oh, yes, very soon.
They are building it now.

818
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:15,200 
Stop! Hammer time!

819
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:17,520 
Enjoy Bratislava!

820
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:20,040 
It's good you came in summer.

821
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:23,560 
In winter, it can get very depressing.

822
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:27,680 
We gotta figure something out.
How much money do we have?

823
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:34,720 
Frommer's travel tip.

824
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:37,960 
I don't have anything.

825
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:40,240 
What? I got noth... fine.

826
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:49,520 
$1.83 American.

827
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,440 
What are we gonna get with that?

828
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:00,760 
Gotta love that exchange rate!

829
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:03,400 
Ta.

830
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:10,160 
Hapi Djus.

831
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,080 
Teraz bez drenei.

832
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:15,200 
Hmm. Now with less pulp.

833
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,200 
Dinner is served.

834
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:20,760 
Would the masters care
for anything else?

835
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,600 
Think we're good. Thanks.

836
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,720 
Ah! A nickel!

837
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:30,040 
You see this?

838
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:34,480 
- I quit!

839
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:37,280 
I open my own hotel!

840
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,440 
So, we got 27 cents left.

841
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,680 
What is there to do in this town?

842
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:59,520 
- " My Scotty "
- " Scotty, Scotty "

843
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:03,160 
" Scotty doesn't know "

844
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:05,200 
" Don't tell Scotty "

845
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,200 
- " Scotty doesn't know "

846
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:11,320 
This song sounds familiar.

847
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:17,520 
Jenny, lemme check your coat.

848
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,920 
- Hey!
- Jenny!

849
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,360 
That outfit is horrible!
Just take it off... now!

850
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:32,160 
No, but I will let you
buy me a drink.

851
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:33,560 
Excuse me!

852
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,160 
You are the woman from the Paris
train station, aren't you?

853
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:40,000 
- My name is...
- Christoph.

854
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:41,680 
Yes.

855
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,400 
What are you doing here?

856
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:46,800 
This is my place. My family owns
many nightclubs in Europe.

857
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:50,040 
I'd be honored if you'd join me
in my V.I.P.Room for a drink.

858
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:51,920 
Mmm-kay.

859
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:55,640 
Bye, Cooper.

860
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,800 
- What's that?
- It's absinthe.

861
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:07,160 
Frommer's says it's
illegal in the States

862
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:09,840 
because it makes you
hallucinate and go crazy.

863
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,120 
They call it "the green fairy."

864
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:21,800 
My family has a yacht in the Aegean.

865
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:25,200 
Come with me, Jennifer.
We will sail away together.

866
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:27,240 
Oh, my God!

867
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:30,560 
We will swim with dolphins,
and sip champagne by moonlight.

868
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:33,200 
Oh, my God!

869
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:36,280 
We will spend the day
sunbathing, drinking wine.

870
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:38,720 
My wife makes the best sangria.

871
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:40,720 
Wait... what?

872
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,320 
Sangria.

873
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,120 
You take a good Spanish Rioja,

874
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:46,440 
and you put in slices of orange, and...

875
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:49,120 
No, wait.
You said you were married?

876
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:54,040 
You go around Europe
sleeping with every woman you meet?

877
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:56,480 
No, please, Jennifer.
It is not like that.

878
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:58,480 
I also sleep with men.

879
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:05,160 
I gotta say, I'm not feeling anything.

880
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:06,680 
Me neither.

881
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:08,480 
Sober as a judge.

882
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:11,280 
How 'bout you?

883
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,360 
I'm not feeling a goddamn thing.

884
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:16,040 
This absinthe is bullshit!

885
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:17,720 
I hear you, my brother.

886
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,640 
I'm outta here.

887
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:21,240 
Excuse me.

888
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:24,520 
- Hey, so where's Christoph?
- Shut up.

889
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:48,360 
- Europe!
- Europe!

890
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,960 
- Whoo!
- Europe!

891
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:07,520 
So, tomorrow, Berlin.

892
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,480 
Tomorrow, Mieke!

893
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:17,400 
Check it out.

894
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,880 
No way!

895
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:23,040 
Jamie's hooking up with another girl?
Goddamn it!

896
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:26,200 
It's just so unfair.
I've been all over,

897
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:29,840 
looking for crazy European sex,
and he's the one who ends up...

898
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:31,960 
- Oh, my God!

899
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:39,080 
That is some pretty fucked-up shit.

900
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:45,600 
Can you say,
"What the fuck did I do last night?"

901
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:03,200 
They really are the worst twins ever.

902
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,480 
That was a pretty wild night, eh?

903
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:36,360 
Yep. Pretty wild, pretty wild.

904
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:40,920 
I know I was out of control.

905
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,600 
How about you guys?
Did you...?

906
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:45,440 
All right, look.
We were really drunk,

907
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:47,920 
things got a little crazy,
and Jamie...

908
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000 
kissed me.

909
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:52,800 
Let's just forget about it, 'kay?

910
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:55,360 
- Consider it forgotten.
- Never happened.

911
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:56,960 
Never happened.

912
01:05:57,080 --> 01:06:00,200 
Fine. Let's just forget about it.

913
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:01,960 
It's not like you two had sex.

914
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:05,760 
- Have you had sex?
- Shut up, Cooper!

915
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:08,640 
Jamie, relax.
Cooper. Please?

916
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:11,040 
OK, fine. I'll give it a rest.

917
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:16,840 
Jamie, could I borrow your Frommer's?

918
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:22,720 
Oh, here it is. Bratislava.

919
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:25,080 
Hmm. Capital of Slovakia.

920
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:27,320 
Oh, here's a fun fact.

921
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:30,680 
You made out with your sister, man!

922
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:33,760 
- Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
- Like two dogs in heat.

923
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:40,040 
My friends, where is the beef?

924
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:44,960 
You go to Berlin?
I'm your ride.

925
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:46,480 
Hop in.

926
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:53,720 
" "99 Red Balloons"

927
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:16,000 
This is Mieke's
apartment building.

928
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:18,440 
Wish me all sorts of luck, guys.

929
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:21,440 
You'll do great, Scotty.

930
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:25,320 
Thanks.

931
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:49,000 
I came all this way.
I'm not gonna miss this.

932
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:57,760 
- Dude, Mieke's hideous! Run!
- Stop.

933
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:11,560 
Hi, my name is Scott Thomas.

934
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:14,000 
I'm from America,
and I'm here to see Mieke.

935
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:16,400 
I'm sorry, but Mieke's not here.

936
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:17,920 
Do you know where she is?

937
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:20,000 
She's gone for the summer.

938
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:37,360 
My daughter had intended
to spend the summer in America,

939
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:40,040 
looking at colleges
and visiting some friends.

940
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:42,960 
But several days ago,
she suddenly changed her mind.

941
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:44,960 
She would not tell me why.

942
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,080 
I think I know why.

943
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:56,800 
This is Heinrich.
He's Mieke's stepbrother.

944
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:59,920 
As I was saying,
she packed up her bag and left.

945
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,640 
- It was all very sudden.
- Do you know where she is now?

946
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:06,080 
She's always been
very interested in the classics,

947
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:10,200 
Greek and Roman literature, history,
and she's always enjoyed the ocean,

948
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:13,400 
so she found a program that
combines all her interests.

949
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:15,120 
Do you know where she is?

950
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:19,720 
She enrolled in a summer at sea
program, based in Rome.

951
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:22,440 
Rome.

952
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:25,200 
OK, then I guess we'll go to Rome, then.

953
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:28,160 
Unfortunately, Mieke's only
in Rome for orientation.

954
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:31,800 
Tomorrow her group boards a boat
and she'll be gone for the summer.

955
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:34,640 
She'll be quite unreachable.

956
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:37,040 
Unreachable.

957
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:46,720 
Mieke's tour group goes
to the Vatican tomorrow,

958
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:48,920 
then she gets on that boat
and she's gone.

959
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:50,520 
So, it's over?

960
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:56,800 
Thanks for sticking with me
through this, guys, but...

961
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:59,160 
you should probably call your parents,

962
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:02,240 
have them wire you
some money and go home.

963
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,080 
What are you gonna do?

964
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:06,720 
I'm going to Rome.

965
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,080 
I'll walk, I'll hitchhike,

966
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:13,120 
I'll swim if I have to,
but I'll get to Mieke somehow.

967
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,440 
Maybe that'll help.

968
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:20,960 
Where'd you get all that?

969
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:23,880 
Wait. Where's your Leica?

970
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,800 
Sold it.

971
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:27,440 
What?

972
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:31,840 
You sold your Leica?
But you loved that thing.

973
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:34,520 
What about your Europe photo tour,
the chateaus?

974
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:37,240 
Chateaus have been there
for 300 years.

975
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:39,080 
Mieke's gone in 12 hours.

976
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:46,520 
Let's go! Frommer's says check in three
hours before international flights.

977
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:48,680 
Come here, guidebook!

978
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:51,640 
Whoo! We're going to Rome.
We're going to Rome!

979
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:03,760 
" Be my girl "

980
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:07,000 
" Be my girl "

981
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:08,680 
" Are you gonna be my "

982
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:11,520 
" Girl, yeah "

983
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,440 
" Be my girl "

984
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:16,040 
" Be my girl "

985
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:19,200 
" Are you gonna be my girl "

986
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:25,840 
All right, summer at sea group.

987
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:28,000 
Our tour begins in the Vatican museum.

988
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:30,080 
This way, please.

989
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:40,000 
There it is.

990
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:48,960 
This entrance is
for private tour groups only.

991
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:53,480 
Oh... but we are
a private tour group.

992
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:55,640 
We've come all the way from America.

993
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:01,280 
That guy in the orange jacket
is mentally retarded.

994
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:10,800 
Si, I can tell.
How very, very sad.

995
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:12,880 
Yes, it is.

996
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:15,280 
But if you are a tour,
where is your guide?

997
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:17,400 
We've got a fantastic tour guide.

998
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:20,280 
- Right here.
- What? No...

999
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,360 
The Vatican has been used
as a papal residence

1000
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:28,760 
ever since the time
of Constantine the Great

1001
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:30,440 
of the 5th century A.D.!

1002
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:34,320 
- Oh.

1003
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:38,200 
OK... um... if you'll
all follow me, please.

1004
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,600 
Have a very special day

1005
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:49,120 
for a very special little man.

1006
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:50,800 
OK.

1007
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:55,320 
I can't believe that guy let us in.

1008
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:57,160 
What a retard!

1009
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:58,840 
- Let's find Mieke.
- Scusate.

1010
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:03,480 
One of our English-speaking
tour guides has called in sick.

1011
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:06,600 
Could you please take
these peoples also?

1012
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:12,520 
- How big is Vatican City?
-. 5 square kilometers.

1013
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:16,520 
- Who built the colonnades?
- Gianlorenzo Bernini, 1656.

1014
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:19,000 
- Where are the bathrooms?
- Floors 2,6 and 7.

1015
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:22,880 
Next I'll take you to where the
College of Cardinals elects a new pope.

1016
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:26,120 
When this happens, white smoke
is sent up from the Vatican.

1017
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:29,480 
- Here's a fun fact...
- Mieke must be around here somewhere.

1018
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:30,520 
Let's go.

1019
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:42,200 
Behind me is the appartamento papale,

1020
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:45,720 
or "papal apartment."
We're obviously not permitted.

1021
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:49,720 
Excuse me, miss. What is this?

1022
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:51,480 
That is the bell of San Marco.

1023
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:53,960 
When the pope dies,
the Cardinal Vicar of Rome

1024
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:56,440 
rings this bell to notify
the people of Rome.

1025
01:13:56,520 --> 01:14:00,240 
Next we will view the Sistine Chapel.
Follow me, please.

1026
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:05,480 
Come on. I think I hear them.

1027
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,000 
Which way did they go?

1028
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:09,320 
That way. I'd stake
my reputation on it.

1029
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:11,200 
Good enough for me.

1030
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,720 
Hey, check it out!
I wonder what this does.

1031
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:18,800 
It doesn't do anything,
it's a rope. Come on, let's go.

1032
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:20,920 
They got a lot
of old stuff here.

1033
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:29,840 
Dio mio!

1034
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:32,840 
The bell of San Marco!

1035
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:36,520 
The pope is dead!

1036
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:41,680 
Whoa.

1037
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:46,080 
She's not in here.

1038
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:49,080 
Let's go. We're definitely
not supposed to be in here.

1039
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:51,360 
Hey, check this out!

1040
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:53,760 
- I'm the pope!
- Cooper...

1041
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:56,360 
take off the pope hat.

1042
01:14:56,480 --> 01:15:00,720 
- Oh, no. It's OK.I'm catholic.
- Take it off, goddamnit!

1043
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:03,720 
Oh, you took
the Lord's name in vain!

1044
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:06,080 
Only I can forgive
you now, my son.

1045
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:07,800 
Take that fudging thing off!

1046
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:09,960 
The pope breaks an open-field tackle.

1047
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:12,600 
It's a Hail Mary,
he catches at the 40...

1048
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:14,920 
the 30, the 20, the 10...

1049
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,320 
touchdown, Pope!

1050
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:21,280 
The pope makes a two-point conversion.

1051
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,880 
And oh, my Lord!
It's the Pope, eight,

1052
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:26,360 
and the heathens, nothing!

1053
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,560 
How's you, sucka?

1054
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:34,840 
Cooper, the hat! The hat!

1055
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:36,320 
The hat is on fire!

1056
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,480 
" We don't need no water
let the m... "

1057
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:40,320 
I'm not kidding! Look!

1058
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,400 
Oh, holy shit!

1059
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:44,840 
I don't want this!

1060
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:47,080 
Fireplace! Fireplace!
Go, go!

1061
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:50,640 
Whoa!

1062
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:59,960 
White smoke!

1063
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:03,240 
They've elected the new pope!

1064
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:07,960 
I'm coming to you live
from Vatican Square

1065
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:10,600 
where the College of Cardinals,
in a surprise move,

1066
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:15,280 
has just elected a new pope.
The crowd is very excited.

1067
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:17,280 
This is so strange.

1068
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:21,000 
Usually they wait 15 days
to elect a new pope.

1069
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:23,280 
We could be seeing
history in the making!

1070
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:25,840 
We could be seeing an arrest
in the making.

1071
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:36,200 
There she is. Mieke!

1072
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,560 
Hey! Stupid curtain!

1073
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:43,600 
Let me out!

1074
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:48,680 
Mieke!

1075
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:50,880 
It's the new pope!

1076
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:19,960 
What the hell...?

1077
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:26,240 
Mieke!

1078
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:30,520 
Hold on!

1079
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:38,760 
This is one crazy pope.

1080
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:49,280 
You!

1081
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:52,400 
Ferma! Stop! You!

1082
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:58,280 
You... and your retarded friend,

1083
01:17:58,360 --> 01:18:00,080 
you're in big, big trouble.

1084
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:01,240 
Oy!

1085
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:06,680 
Take your mitts off them boys!

1086
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:08,920 
They're with me!

1087
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:13,960 
I've just about had enough
of you fuckin' ities!

1088
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:16,240 
But I am Swiss!

1089
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:19,280 
Them, too!

1090
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:26,320 
Now, bud...

1091
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:29,320 
you get in there, and you
say what you got to say.

1092
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:33,080 
Mieke. I'm here.

1093
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:34,520 
I made it.

1094
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:39,560 
Who are you?

1095
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:47,120 
What a fucking loser!
I'm gonna videotape this.

1096
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:50,800 
I'm Scott.

1097
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:52,320 
From Ohio?

1098
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:56,000 
Scott? Scott Thomas?

1099
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:59,680 
- Yes.
- From Ohio?

1100
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:02,760 
- What are you doing in Rome?
- I came here to be with you.

1101
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:05,520 
Listen, I just traveled
all the way across Europe.

1102
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:08,000 
I got chased by naked men.

1103
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:11,640 
I ate brownies with absolutely
no drugs in them.

1104
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:15,720 
I watched a brother
and sister make out.

1105
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:19,880 
I kicked a robot in the balls,
but I did it all so that...

1106
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,120 
so I could tell you one thing.

1107
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:26,840 
I love you, Mieke.

1108
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:29,400 
Aww...

1109
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:32,200 
We're perfect for each other.
What do you think?

1110
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:35,200 
I think...

1111
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:53,760 
Oh, Mike... Mieke!

1112
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:09,200 
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

1113
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:10,800 
I have cheated on my husband.

1114
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:13,640 
Do you think God will ever forgive me?

1115
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:15,600 
Oh, yes!

1116
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:18,200 
- Father?

1117
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:30,160 
This sucks.

1118
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:33,920 
I can't believe I'm the only one
who didn't hook up while we were here.

1119
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,840 
Europe is officially
the worst country on Earth.

1120
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:38,400 
I know.

1121
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:42,040 
I thought I'd at least get to
have some crazy European sex.

1122
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:47,000 
What?

1123
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:58,080 
- Scott, I have to go.
- OK.

1124
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:01,560 
My boat is leaving.

1125
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:04,000 
I still can't believe
you came all the way here,

1126
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:05,560 
just for me.

1127
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:09,040 
What can I say?
I'm very unpredictable.

1128
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:11,800 
Keep writing to me, Scott, OK?

1129
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:13,400 
Yeah, I will.

1130
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:24,640 
- Go.
- Bye.

1131
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:34,520 
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1132
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:37,560 
Whoo-hoo!

1133
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:41,080 
Hey, guys, I'm so glad we got
to take this trip together.

1134
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:43,560 
This was the best time of my life.

1135
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:49,080 
Excuse me.

1136
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:52,640 
You're the young man who gave me
that tour of the Vatican, aren't you?

1137
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:58,080 
- Listen, I'm very sorry...
- I just wanted to thank you.

1138
01:21:58,160 --> 01:22:01,520 
You were the most knowledgeable,
albeit idiosyncratic,

1139
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:03,440 
tour guide I've ever had.

1140
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:05,200 
Thanks.

1141
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:07,480 
But I'm not actually a tour guide.

1142
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:10,440 
I've just read Frommer's
enough to have it memorized.

1143
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:13,360 
Although I threw in a few things
Frommer's didn't know about.

1144
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:15,240 
How would you like to add them?

1145
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:16,720 
Excuse me?

1146
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:19,800 
That's my guidebook.

1147
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:26,760 
I'm Arthur Frommer.

1148
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:30,320 
It's amazing!

1149
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:34,680 
Frommer's is going to pay me to see
every museum and cathedral in Europe.

1150
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:38,080 
- That sounds so exciting...

1151
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:41,000 
for you.

1152
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:43,360 
I figured, since you're
going to be staying,

1153
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:45,800 
you might need this.

1154
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:48,640 
- A disposable camera.
- That's right.

1155
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:49,920 
Thanks, Scotty.

1156
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,560 
That's from both of us.

1157
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:01,320 
Hello, Mr. Walters.

1158
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:03,080 
I see.

1159
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:05,760 
Fired? Well, I...

1160
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:09,760 
Well, if that's what you want,
I understand. I just...

1161
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:12,600 
goodbye, sir.

1162
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:14,360 
They had to catch you
eventually, right?

1163
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:16,640 
- No, they fired Humphrey.
- Shut up!

1164
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:18,080 
I got his office and a raise.

1165
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:19,640 
- No!

1166
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:23,320 
Flight 341
from Rome to Cleveland...

1167
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:24,600 
That's you guys.

1168
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:27,120 
- Have a good flight, everybody.
- Come here.

1169
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,400 
Be good.

1170
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:34,920 
- Oh! OK...

1171
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:37,720 
- Cooper, have a good flight.
- Be good.

1172
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:38,880 
Thanks.

1173
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:13,840 
I'm on it.

1174
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:25,360 
This still
counts as Europe, right?

1175
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:36,240 
"Dear Mieke,

1176
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:39,120 
"Greece sounds incredible.

1177
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:41,120 
"I just moved into my dorm room today,

1178
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:43,920 
"but I can't wait to see you
over Christmas break.

1179
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,800 
"This time I think
I'll fly to Berlin direct."

1180
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:56,040 
- Hello?
- Hey, buddy, how's college?

1181
01:24:56,120 --> 01:24:59,040 
I just got here. My roommate
hasn't even showed up yet.

1182
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:01,480 
Do they room all you
pre-med geeks together?

1183
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:03,120 
I'm not sure I'm going pre-med.

1184
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:05,160 
I'm thinking about majoring in German.

1185
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:07,320 
German? I've got a better idea.

1186
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:09,800 
Why don't you major
in not being such a woman?

1187
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:11,400 
So, how's Jenny?

1188
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:13,280 
Jenny... Jenny who?

1189
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:16,120 
I know a lot of ladies
named Jenny, they're all...

1190
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:17,520 
Ow!

1191
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:20,840 
Hey, Scotty, what's up?

1192
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:22,120 
Hi, Jenny!

1193
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:24,280 
How's Jamie doing with Frommer?

1194
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:25,560 
Oh, no.

1195
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:31,800 
Hold on.

1196
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:33,800 
Come here, robot!

1197
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:35,880 
Cooper, not again!

1198
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,760 
Hold on, this could be
my new roommate.

1199
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:47,520 
What's the freak look like?

1200
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:51,040 
Is he a dork or is he cool?
Better not be cooler than me.

1201
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:53,200 
Is he bigger than me?

1202
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:56,120 
I just got your last email.
What are you doing here?

1203
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:58,280 
Going to college.

1204
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:00,760 
You're going to college here?

1205
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:04,080 
- What dorm?
- This one.

1206
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:06,560 
Room 214.

1207
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:11,600 
How is this possible?

1208
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:14,960 
I guess they thought I was a guy.

1209
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:18,920 
Now who would be dumb enough
to make a mistake like that?

1210
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:29,720 
Do I hear kissing?

1211
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:32,920 
Are you making out with
your new roommate, Scotty?

1212
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:37,400 
Scotty?

1213
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:40,200 
Scotty? Scotty!

1214
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:42,920 
" Scotty doesn't know
that Fiona and me "

1215
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,200 
This happy ending is bullshit.

1216
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:48,800 
When does the fairy get laid?
I'm outta here.

1217
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:51,240 
" Still she's on her knees
And Scotty doesn't know "

1218
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:55,920 
" Oh, Scotty doesn't know "

1219
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:58,360 
- Catchy tune.
- Fuckin'-a, man.

1220
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:05,960 
" Fiona says she's out shopping "

1221
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:12,240 
" But she's under me
And I'm not stopping "

1222
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:16,400 
Scotty doesn't know!
Scotty doesn't know!

1223
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:17,640 
Scotty doesn't know!

1224
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:19,800 
Hello, and welcome to

1225
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:23,680 
Amsterdam's finest and most
luxurious youth hostel.

1226
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:25,240 
Sounds great.

1227
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:27,600 
There is no bathroom,
nor is there one nearby.

1228
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:31,280 
" I can't believe
He's so trusting "

1229
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:34,640 
Sorry.

1230
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:38,080 
" While I'm right behind you thrusting "

1231
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:40,160 
- Get it?
- She got it.

1232
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:43,600 
If you do not wish to have
your valuables stolen,

1233
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:47,400 
I suggest destroying them
or discarding them right now.

1234
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:51,040 
You can also try hiding
your valuables...

1235
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:52,760 
in your anus.

1236
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:54,320 
Drink?

1237
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,520 
" Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know "

1238
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:59,840 
" Scotty doesn't know
Don't tell Scotty "

1239
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:02,480 
I'm gonna rip away his pants
and look at his dick, OK?

1240
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:04,640 
- Ready? Quit. Shut up.

1241
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:07,320 
Sorry. I know I fucked it up.

1242
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:09,200 
Yes! You take her hair...

1243
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:13,160 
and one strand at a time,
pull it out!

1244
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:15,880 
Use her like a humping post!

1245
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,960 
Jenny, this is Europe.

1246
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:20,440 
They have orange juice ads
with lesbians and dildos.

1247
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:25,400 
"Happy juice."

1248
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:27,440 
Show them something they haven't seen.

1249
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:31,640 
" Fiona's got him on the phone "

1250
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:34,720 
" And she's trying not to moan "

1251
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:38,520 
" It's a three-way call
And he knows nothing "

1252
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:40,560 
" Nothing, Scotty doesn't know "

1253
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:43,400 
" Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know "

1254
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:46,960 
Should a fire occur,
due to our faulty wiring,

1255
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:51,560 
or the fireworks factory upstairs,
you will be incinerated,

1256
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:55,200 
along with the valuables
you have hidden in your anus.

1257
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:57,640 
" So don't tell Scotty
Scotty doesn't know "

1258
01:28:57,680 --> 01:28:59,200 
" Really want to go "

1259
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:02,000 
" Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know "

1260
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:05,360 
" Scotty doesn't know "

1261
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:09,880 
" The parking lot, why not? "

1262
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:12,480 
" It's so cool when you're on top "

1263
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:17,520 
" Life is so hard
'Cause Scotty doesn't know "

1264
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:19,720 
" Scotty doesn't know "

1265
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:22,480 
Fuck off! Get out of it, you wankers!

1266
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:26,280 
Go on, you gaelic fucking
garlic-breath tossers!

1267
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:28,600 
Piss off! Get in here
and say that, mate!

1268
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:31,080 
Come on! Fucking come and have it!

1269
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:32,880 
You fucking beep?!

1270
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:35,960 
We'll beep, you bastard,
all over your fucking nose!

1271
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:37,200 
Fuck off!

1272
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:39,200 
Go on, you French bastards!

1273
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:42,000 
Get on the other side
of the road, you pricks!

1274
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:43,720 
Go on out of it!

1275
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:45,200 
Fuck off!

1276
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:47,000 
I'm nackered.

1277
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:49,120 
- League supporters.

1278
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:51,840 
" Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know "

1279
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:54,520 
- No, wait...

1280
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:03,560 
Hey! Check these out!
I'm 18 years old.
