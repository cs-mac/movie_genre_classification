- Bill Weaver, what's up?

314
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:45,941
I just moved here with my daughter,
who's 17,

315
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:48,147
and we have a rental on Sycamore Lane.

316
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,233
And you wanted to know
if I thought it was possible

317
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,945
you had a 17-year-old daughter.
I would have to say no.

318
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:56,826
It's actually about Ryan Jacobson.

319
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,238
He drove my daughter home
the other night.

320
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:03,125
I was just wondering if you
knew anything about him. If he's...

321
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,079
OK?

322
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:06,124
Yeah.

323
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,748
Finding out that your parents
were murdered,

324
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:12,794
by your own sister, God,
that's really intense.

325
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,134
You'd think people would show him
a little bit of sympathy, right?

326
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:20,844
You know, I drove three hours upstate
personally to tell Ryan.

327
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,478
He was living with his aunt,
a senile old woman.

328
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:27,562
He had no one taking care of him.
He was taking care of her, actually.

329
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:31,069
Anyway, he moved back here with her,
she died about a year ago.

330
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:34,823
The kid's had a tough, tough life.

331
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:37,701
Look, I've never had
any problem with him,

332
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,657
and as far as I know,
no one else has either.

333
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:43,199
But they sure like to bitch about him
and their property values, don't they?

334
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:46,118
Yeah, I have heard people doing that.
