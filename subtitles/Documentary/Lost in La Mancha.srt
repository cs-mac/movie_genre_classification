1
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,140
As long as I can remember,
I think he was talking about

2
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,340
doing Quixote.
He believes in Quixote.

3
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,180
It's Terry's sort of film.

4
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,660
It mixes all his humor, his fun,
his joy and his darkness.

5
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,760
It's the best sort of
Terry Gilliam.

6
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:04,060
Every film Terry makes, Terry somehow
manifests himself as the characters.

7
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:09,140
And yeah, Quixote, there he is,
a man charging against windmills.

8
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,620
This has been bugging me
for a long time,

9
00:01:19,821 --> 00:01:21,821
Quixote has been dogging me.

10
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:26,820
The first time we started this, trying
to get Quixote on the page was around 91.

11
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,720
I had been fantasizing this
for a very long time.

12
00:01:31,721 --> 00:01:33,721
I made the film in my head.

13
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,980
The pictures were there.
It's been played out many, many times.

14
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,420
Quixote has
obsesses me for years,

15
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,240
because all my stuff has
has been about reality,

16
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,820
fantasy, madness, sanity.
Quixote encompasses all of those.

17
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,580
Exterior. Spanish hilltop. Day.

18
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,900
In black and white.
An ancient stone windmill.

19
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,100
Okay, cut.
You know what I mean?

20
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,280
- Sorry.
- Back to the top.

21
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,820
- It's always hard...
- Back to the top.

22
00:02:15,821 --> 00:02:17,221
- Terry, Tony?
- ...the first scene. This tension.

23
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,340
OK, you guys ready?

24
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,020
- We're going back?
- From the top.

25
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,540
I'm gonna go and roll now.
Scene 1, take 2.

26
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,260
Exterior. Spanish hilltop. Day.

27
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,500
An ancient stone windmill
spins slowly in the breeze.

28
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:36,940
Don Quixote appears, gaunt, aged,
a madly fierce gleam in his eyes.

29
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,160
Stand your ground,
foul and fearsome giant!

30
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,540
I am Don Quixote de la Mancha!

31
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,400
Next to him is his fat partner,
Sancho Panza.

32
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,100
- It's just a windmill!
- Stand aside, Sancho!

33
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,660
Don Quixote lowers his lance
and charges the windmill.

34
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:00,280
The lance impales the sail and
Don Quixote is wrenched from Rocinante

35
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,100
and spins high in the air
hooked on the revolving sail.

36
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,780
It's starting to look...
See it's like out that way.

37
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,860
Terry Gilliam the maverick director
behind such films as

38
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,520
Brazil, The Fischer King
and 12 Monkeys,

39
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:45,020
has been trying to mount a film production
of Don Quixote for more than a decade.

40
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,340
It's interesting down there.

41
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,300
So the military map has
loads of old windmills back there.

42
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,900
That's good. If we can get in there,
that'll be interesting to see.

43
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,300
After several false starts
and financial mishaps with the project,

44
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:01,300
Gilliam has finally arrived in Spain
to begin production.

45
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:07,780
Don Quixote seems to be at the
back of Terry's work for a long time.

46
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:13,020
In the broadest sense, he's a hero
that would appeal to Terry,

47
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:18,260
because the notion of
someone gleefully

48
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:21,900
battling in the face of all odds,
and logic and reality,

49
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,780
is one that appeals to him.

50
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,260
What happens in
Cervantes' Don Quixote

51
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,020
is that you meet a man,
an old man,

52
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,880
a man who surrounds himself
with romantic novels,

53
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,500
tales of the deeds of
great knights.

54
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,320
He then decides that
he will go forth

55
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,800
and actually live out
these romantic tales himself.

56
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,000
And so he puts together
a suit of armor

57
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:54,501
out of bits and pieces
he finds around the house.

58
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,080
The famous helmet is
a shaving basin

59
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,060
with the piece cut out
for the neck.

60
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:04,300
He saddles his horse Rocinante,
who is an old nag, is falling to pieces.

61
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,580
All he's missing is
his faithful squire.

62
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:11,900
And Sancho Panza is a short,
fat guy with a donkey, a peasant.

63
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:18,380
So they set off and they start
to look for daring deeds to do.

64
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,740
Quixote is so deluded that where
other people see a windmill,

65
00:05:22,741 --> 00:05:23,841
he sees a giant.

66
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:28,820
where other people see a windmill's sails,
he sees the flailing arms of those giants.

67
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:37,260
Quixote's delusions are
a major part of his appeal for us.

68
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,300
We want to see the world
through Quixote's eyes.

69
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:43,500
Because the way he sees
the world, I think,

70
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,900
connects with the way
that we saw the world as children.

71
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,740
A world where objects
did have a magical significance.

72
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:19,420
Gilliam has fought many battles to
bring his vision of Quixote to the screen.

73
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:23,300
After several unsuccessful attempts
to develop the project in Hollywood

74
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,060
he decided to produce
the film in Europe.

75
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,900
Quixote will be among
the most expensive films

76
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,060
ever produced solely
with European funds.

77
00:06:39,661 --> 00:06:41,661
Ladies and gentlemen, we just,

78
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,220
basically just called this meeting

79
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,040
because we haven't had
a sort of open forum.

80
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:48,740
At least, that is, until now.

81
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,560
We're missing a few people of course,

82
00:06:50,561 --> 00:06:51,661
but this is, you represent

83
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,040
the main bodies of the film

84
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,841
that are under work
at the moment.

85
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:01,300
This is the first time that we have
Senor Gilliam in Spain

86
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,900
and he's here to stay. So there's
no excuses for any of us now.

87
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,900
If we have any questions,
if we have any doubts

88
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:12,260
or there's something we want to
know, this is the place to come to.

89
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,060
I've said this to a few different people,
I don't know if I said it to everybody,

90
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,260
but I think it's going to be great.

91
00:07:16,261 --> 00:07:17,960
I think everyone's
got a good sense of humor,

92
00:07:18,162 --> 00:07:20,160
Everybody's smart,
everybody's good at their job

93
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,420
And you, with any luck, will protect me
from making an utter fool of myself.

94
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:30,240
One thing to say is, you know I'll
keep demanding all sorts of things.

95
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,660
And you've got to scream, earlier than
later. Say "no, can't, can't do it."

96
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:39,380
Because we all know that we are working
on a budget that is way below

97
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,180
what we normally need
to make a film like this.

98
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:46,820
We gotta do it for what we've got
and find ways of doing it.

99
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,420
Basically, let's get on with it.

100
00:07:48,421 --> 00:07:51,021
He's here now, he's a resource,
let's use him, let's drain him.

101
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,580
He knows the film.
He's been with it for... 2 years?

102
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,860
Let's give it 10.
Let's give it the whole decade.

103
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,660
Let's go with 10 years.
He knows it for 10 years.

104
00:07:59,761 --> 00:08:01,461
So he should know what he's doing.

105
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,840
Gilliam is not the first filmmaker

106
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,060
to have struggled to bring
Quixote to the screen.

107
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,080
In 1957, Orson Welles
began production

108
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,820
on his own adaptation
of Don Quixote.

109
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:20,380
The project would become Welles's
creative obsession for the next two decades.

110
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:24,940
In a village in La Mancha,
whose name I prefer not to recall...

111
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:29,580
Welles took on various acting and
directing projects to help finance the film.

112
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,780
He would gather bits and pieces of footage
whenever he could,

113
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,180
even after the project outlived
Francisco Reiguera...

114
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,980
Welles's Quixote.

115
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:41,700
But by the time of Welles's death
in 1985

116
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,340
Quixote remained incomplete.

117
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,980
The struggle to launch Quixote
began just a year ago

118
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:13,260
when Gilliam actually started
pre-production on the film

119
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:17,380
only to have a major financier
back out at the last minute.

120
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,680
In order to get
the film going this time,

121
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,660
Gilliam and his producer
have had to scale back the budget,

122
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,580
from 40 to 32 million dollars.

123
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:54,820
The budget of this thing is
about $32.1 million.

124
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,880
Which by European standards

125
00:09:56,881 --> 00:09:57,981
without American investment

126
00:09:57,982 --> 00:09:59,982
is a big chunk of change.

127
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,740
For what we're trying to do,
it's half the money we need.

128
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,820
In Gilliam's adaptation,

129
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:10,060
he has taken the
fantastic story of Don Quixote

130
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,260
and embellished it
with another layer of fantasy.

131
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,500
He's created the story of
Toby Grosini,

132
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:21,420
a modern day advertising executive
who travels back into the 17th century

133
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,500
where Quixote
mistakes him for Sancho Panza.

134
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,300
Johnny Depp stars as Toby,

135
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:32,140
Vanessa Paradis plays Toby's
"love interest" Altisidora,

136
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:37,020
and the veteran French actor
Jean Rochefort plays Don Quixote.

137
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:41,660
The script is as ambitious as
anything Gilliam has ever attempted.

138
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,660
Stand your ground,
foul and fearsome giant,

139
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,580
I am Don Quixote de la Mancha!

140
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,860
It's not a giant, it is a windmill!

141
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,900
I am Don Quixote de la Mancha!

142
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,900
It's not a giant, it is a windmill!

143
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,740
More intense.
"It's not a giant..."

144
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,580
It's not a giant, it is a windmill!

145
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,000
I must say, there are very few scenes
that are simple.

146
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,180
Terry as we all well know,

147
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,300
has the tendency of

148
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:34,201
overloading everything.

149
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,140
I mean there is nothing ever

150
00:11:36,141 --> 00:11:37,341
simple and plain.

151
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,380
They'll be on things
so they can walk down.

152
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,800
Yes, that's what you're saying.
I know.

153
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,720
So he ends up like a kid
holding on to it.

154
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,460
We rig this thing so
the camera can get like that.

155
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,900
Because looking down will be amazing.

156
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:02,060
Terry came to make a Hollywood movie
without Hollywood, it's almost impossible.

157
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,880
The difficulty is making a film

158
00:12:03,881 --> 00:12:05,181
the best possible way

159
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:07,182
with the money we have.

160
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,420
I think that's the better face.

161
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,700
Now, the sheep can
go here very nicely.

162
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,200
They come around that curve,
tons of sheep.

163
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:34,540
This will be very tumultuous.
This film will not be easy.

164
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:38,500
Making a film with Terry,
is like riding a bareback pony.

165
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,640
Just grab on to the mane,

166
00:12:42,641 --> 00:12:43,941
dig in the heels

167
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,780
and the knees and hang on.
Because you're in for the ride of your life.

168
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,780
Distant thunder.

169
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,020
- What's that?
- Don't look.

170
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,720
Toby goes to twist around
in his saddle.

171
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,240
- Something's coming.
- There's nothing there.

172
00:13:01,241 --> 00:13:02,541
Please don't look.

173
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,100
Giant shadows rise across Toby.

174
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,580
He turns, he looks back.

175
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,060
Three giants loom
up over the brow of the hill.

176
00:13:13,061 --> 00:13:14,861
In their hands are great cudgels.

177
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,860
One plays castanets.

178
00:13:56,061 --> 00:14:00,461
The third is fantastic.

179
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,400
Come to me.

180
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,500
You've got to see the giants.

181
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,240
What is terrifying and what is
extraordinary about it,

182
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,260
it's suddenly you're seeing
what Quixote sees.

183
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,540
And it's like nothing
you've seen in film.

184
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,820
Altisidora and Toby
charge down a corridor.

185
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,340
She wheels her horse.
They set off down a dark tunnel.

186
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,820
Sounds echo behind them -
their pursuers.

187
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,580
They emerge into an utterly dark space.
Altisidora reigns in her horse.

188
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:03,060
- What's wrong?
- I thought this was the way, but...

189
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,360
- Halt!
- They turn and are confronted by...

190
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,780
- ...Don Quixote.
- Traitor! Judas!

191
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:12,380
As Don Quixote moves forward,
we see he is a giant puppet.

192
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,180
Toby and Altisidora are suddenly surrounded
by a dozen armored guards.

193
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,300
The guards are puppets too.

194
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,500
When this thing splits apart, Toby has
got to have his arm getting caught in it.

195
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,610
There is no way to get his arm caught
when it comes back together.

196
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,780
- Absolutely.
- Have his arm caught?

197
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:42,060
Yes, this is like whole a key bit.

198
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,820
Could the whole thing become... just
chop and pull it, push it, make it thinner

199
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,560
so that when get gets his arm in there.

200
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:50,460
- So really that his...
- No, no...

201
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,980
We have to touch the molds again.

202
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,320
I know you're going to

203
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:57,221
have to touch the molds.

204
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,500
That's what I'm assuming, yeah. Unless...

205
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,380
No, I'm just thinking about
the time again.

206
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,480
I understand, I know,
I know, yes.

207
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,780
I like taking on very complex
and difficult challenges.

208
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:13,820
If it's easy, I don't do it. If it is almost
impossible to do, I have a go at it.

209
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,020
It seems that's
what gets my adrenaline going.

210
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:21,320
Maybe it's what fires
what creativity I have.

211
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,900
Without battle, maybe I don't know
exactly how to approach it.

212
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:30,460
The action is very simple,
except that there's horses.

213
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:34,020
So the action of the horses is complicated,
but with the puppets it's very simple.

214
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:37,180
Toby has got to lash out at the puppet.
It's gotta go "poof" in the air.

215
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,220
He gets tangled and "whoof" off his horse.

216
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,860
I can do all that.

217
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,340
All that. In the studio,

218
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,260
I paint black the floor.

219
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,620
No, but you still have to do
the wooden floor like that.

220
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,500
I have to cut part of the...

221
00:16:52,501 --> 00:16:53,501
No, no.

222
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:58,820
Why is it so difficult to have each
of the structures on a plate?

223
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,780
Terry Gilliam has a history
of hugely ambitious projects

224
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:54,020
visually rich films that explore
the fantasy worlds of his protagonists,

225
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,900
all of them dreamers like himself.

226
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,340
But turning his dreams into reality

227
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,420
has not been an easy thing for Gilliam
in the Hollywood studio system.

228
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,940
Beset with visions too elaborate
for low budget financing

229
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,780
but often too eccentric
for Hollywood taste,

230
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:14,060
all his productions
have been a battle.

231
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,420
His wild visions are always accomplished
on limited budgets

232
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:21,980
and have consistently met with
both critical and box office success.

233
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:27,100
The Adventures of Baron Munchausen
was a painful exception.

234
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:36,940
Teamed with a producer who spun tales of
extravagant resources that didn't exist,

235
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,620
Gilliam found himself at the reigns
of a production

236
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:44,300
that was already $10 million over budget
by the end of its 6th week.

237
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:48,940
Despite Gilliam's repeated efforts
to scale back complex scenes,

238
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,980
the budget more than doubled
by the completion of filming.

239
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:57,100
Munchausen became one of the
textbook cases of a film fiasco

240
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:01,860
and Gilliam acquired a reputation
as a director out of control.

241
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,660
That reputation has often made it

242
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,980
extremely difficult for Gilliam
to launch his own projects.

243
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,660
There is a mismatch I think between
the industry's perception of Terry

244
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,460
and how Terry has actually
worked in the past.

245
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,620
And I know it used to drive Terry crazy.

246
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,300
He kept saying if someone mentioned

247
00:19:22,301 --> 00:19:23,901
Baron Munchausen again, he wouldn't be

248
00:19:23,902 --> 00:19:25,002
answerable for his actions.

249
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:28,500
Because he felt, that was a film
that happened I think ten years before,

250
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,200
and people just thought about that

251
00:19:30,201 --> 00:19:32,801
and didn't think of the actual work
he had done in the film since then.

252
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,560
He's a responsible filmmaker.

253
00:19:34,561 --> 00:19:35,961
He understands the responsibility

254
00:19:35,962 --> 00:19:36,862
of filmmaking.

255
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,620
I mean he's, I think, enjoyed

256
00:19:42,021 --> 00:19:46,721
sometimes fencing under
the cloak of enfant terrible.

257
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:51,060
But he's... a responsible enfant terrible.
If there is such a thing.

258
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,460
Just reaching that point now, the actors
are going to have to start turning up soon.

259
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,740
And we've only got what,
seven weeks?

260
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,900
It's got lot of potential
for chaos here.

261
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,700
Due to the production's tight budget,

262
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,820
many of the actors are taking less
than their usual fees

263
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:21,300
and squeezing the film into their
already busy schedules.

264
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,340
The situation has made it
more difficult for Gilliam

265
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,860
to assemble the principal actors for
script readings and rehearsals.

266
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:32,180
I'm still trying
joining Johnny directly.

267
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:38,140
But I think we just plan to go over there
and we wait him out.

268
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:41,900
A flight from London for Tony,
a flight from Paris for Jean,

269
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,700
and we'll surround him.

270
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:47,500
But find out all the possibilities.

271
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,700
We have to march forward.

272
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,020
But I still want to try to reach him.

273
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:57,540
So when do you see Vanessa again?
I mean here.

274
00:20:57,741 --> 00:20:59,241
Vanessa, maybe...

275
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,460
Jean-Yves tell me,

276
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,700
maybe 4, 5, 6...

277
00:21:03,701 --> 00:21:04,901
No. The 7th.

278
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,940
- When Johnny get...
- When Johnny come here.

279
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,620
Well this is what they're
trying to organize.

280
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,620
It would be better to see Johnny,

281
00:21:13,621 --> 00:21:16,021
I mean, you know just also for one day.

282
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,920
- I know.
- Or two days. Just so...

283
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,540
Everything is separated.
The costumes are in Rome

284
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:24,060
the cast is in England
or in France, or in Prague.

285
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,900
Special effects...
everything is everywhere.

286
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:31,260
Until we all get together,
that's when it's going to be the hard work.

287
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,080
What we have to achieve on this,

288
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:40,020
is putting all these people that have been
working in separate places together.

289
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,820
The sets are being made in Spain,
make-up is working from England.

290
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:48,660
Actors are here, there.
But they haven't been together at all.

291
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:51,180
We gotta put everybody together.

292
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:54,100
Everything has to be centralized in Madrid.

293
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:57,100
It's one more reason to have mess,

294
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,780
to have one person in London.

295
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,100
But all the pickups
are not in the same place.

296
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,160
The driver, we don't know where
the driver is coming from,

297
00:22:04,161 --> 00:22:05,461
because we are using this company...

298
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,580
I tell you what, with an actor,
we know that suddenly the actor is...

299
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,660
we don't know where.
If we have to deliver a script change...

300
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,720
I mean I don't know.
So many things can happen. So many things.

301
00:22:14,721 --> 00:22:16,221
Because maybe...

302
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,060
Camera left.

303
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:21,500
<i>More, more, more. Yes.</i>

304
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,260
That's good, right.

305
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:27,061
Raul, look into the camera.

306
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:31,540
Lean over. It's perfect.

307
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,580
Get violent.

308
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,980
Filmed has turned.
Film has finally turned on this film.

309
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,580
That's the trailer
for the film right there.

310
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,060
"Coming Soon."

311
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,920
So do I. So do I.

312
00:24:36,921 --> 00:24:38,821
We're on the same page here.

313
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:42,080
My goal, by September 25th,
is to try and find

314
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:45,540
some actor who will come to Spain
and do pre-production.

315
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:50,440
Because I'm a great believer in rehearsal.
And being prepared before you shoot.

316
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:58,500
My problem still isn't with training.
I know all of these guys know horses.

317
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:03,020
My problem is this fucking organization
because it's a fucking nightmare.

318
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,260
Traditionally on film productions,

319
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:10,330
it's the responsibility of the first
assistant director to set a schedule

320
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,060
which complements the film's budget.

321
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:17,160
In this particular case, Phil Patterson has
inherited a budget and schedule

322
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:21,020
which leave no margin for error,
no safety net.

323
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,700
Every film is different.

324
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:27,860
It's very hard to compare a Terry Gilliam
film to anybody else's films.

325
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:31,310
It's very hard to say
what's right or wrong,

326
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,500
but this film is in,

327
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:40,180
I like to say, complete disarray.
Absolute and emphatic disarray.

328
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:44,900
But it is absolutely the correct way it
should be, given that it's Terry,

329
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:48,260
given that it's a Gilliam film.
Because Captain Chaos...

330
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,460
is completely in his element
at the moment.

331
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:55,020
Now, you walk this way.
Come to me, lead on.

332
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:59,140
Down this way. Turn a bit.

333
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,380
It isn't a disaster.

334
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:06,180
It just has a lot of elements
that seem to be a little different.

335
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,700
Rocinante.

336
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,180
You can't eat.

337
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,980
You're not allowed to eat.

338
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,900
Look at those ribs. I thought
we were going to need make-up - look.

339
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,100
The pelvic bones are fantastic.

340
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:29,060
- You are there.
- I'm here, you're here, we're here!

341
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,780
Jean Rochefort is the first
of the principal actors

342
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,220
to be able to schedule
a short trip to Madrid

343
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:37,060
for the necessary costume and
make-up tests.

344
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,460
This is the ride
for the theme park.

345
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:43,080
Rochefort has been learning English
for the last 7 months

346
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,620
in order to play the part
of Don Quixote.

347
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,580
This is Toby Grosini.
This is the Duchess.

348
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:53,060
- Little, little it comes together.
- Spanish actors?

349
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:56,340
Yes, the majority are Spanish.

350
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,420
They do not speak English.

351
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,580
Nobody speaks English
on this film.

352
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,400
Jean Rochefort
is just so beyond perfect.

353
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:09,900
The spirit of the man
is absolutely right,

354
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:14,060
and his comic timing is perfect,
his dignity,

355
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,500
All of those things are all there.

356
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,780
What I'd like to try is,
an experiment to make your nose

357
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:23,820
a little bit more Spanish.
Something very small.

358
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:28,020
Because Jean has a great nose,
but when I look at these Spanish noses...

359
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:35,900
It's just a tiny bit more
to make it

360
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,580
a little bit more Spanish.

361
00:27:37,581 --> 00:27:39,781
It's something,
if you think about it, it's bad.

362
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:44,580
Thank you. Because,
perhaps if I have this,

363
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:48,460
I feel that I play Don Quixote.

364
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,860
I want to be Quixote.

365
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:55,340
- I understand.
- I want to think I am Quixote.

366
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,180
Perfectly.

367
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,620
This is a marvelous day for me.

368
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,180
Not only is he perfect for the part,
he's a great horseman.

369
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:11,540
That is always my biggest problem,
finding a guy old enough, 70 years old,

370
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:15,820
who looks right, can act well,
and can ride a horse.

371
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,980
So the question is...
the three of us, where...

372
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,080
I just want to know

373
00:28:23,081 --> 00:28:24,081
I want to get down so

374
00:28:24,082 --> 00:28:25,482
I understand everything.

375
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:30,980
Where we are with Vanessa
at the moment?

376
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:34,260
- So where are we contractually?
- The contract is not signed.

377
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:38,480
The agent says no! Each time
we are asking something,

378
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:42,660
availability for your meeting,
availability for the test,

379
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:47,500
the agent says "no, she is not available".
"We need Vanessa on the 11th."

380
00:28:47,501 --> 00:28:53,200
"No, she is not available."
So we are more or less a little bit...

381
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:56,300
trapped. If we have
weather condition problems,

382
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:59,780
we have to have her agreement
to change any dates.

383
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,940
That's crazy.

384
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:04,580
We have very set pieces for
the second-string actors.

385
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:07,700
Miranda, Bill Patterson,
Peter Vaughan, etc...

386
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:11,340
The only thing we have in our favor
is the notion of some flexibility

387
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,980
to move around
the rest of the work we're doing

388
00:29:13,981 --> 00:29:16,381
by having Vanessa on a picture deal,

389
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:20,180
Johnny Depp on a picture deal,
Jean Rochefort on a picture deal.

390
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:26,300
If we take Vanessa: "It can only be this,
this, this", we're in deep shit.

391
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:30,350
It's not possible. We did the deal.
I don't understand how it slides.

392
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,530
Because, and this is what
kind of makes me crazy,

393
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:35,310
the fact that contracts are
allowed to run this long.

394
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,800
To be this close to shooting
and not have a contract...

395
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:42,700
is crazy. We are so fragile.

396
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:45,500
Hanging on strings.

397
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:49,400
And if we don't have any flexibility
with her, we're dead.

398
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,300
Quixote struck me more powerfully
when I reached middle age

399
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:15,140
because that's what I though
Quixote was very much about.

400
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:18,740
He's an older man, he's been through life,
it's kind of like a last "Hurrah"

401
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,780
He has one last chance to

402
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:25,180
make the world as interesting
as he dreams it to be.

403
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:29,460
I'll be 61 years in another couple months.
Just an old man!

404
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,020
I've only done X number of films.

405
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:35,300
Wish I would have done more, the amount
of ideas floating around in my head.

406
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:44,260
All of the film's interior scenes
must be shot on a sound stage.

407
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,620
Gilliam's producers have been
able to secure

408
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:49,380
the last available
sound stage in Madrid.

409
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:52,420
And it's important for Gilliam and his team
to inspect the site

410
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,780
before sets construction can begin.

411
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:58,020
So we're supposed to put
all our sets in here?

412
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,300
- The acoustics are appalling.
- Si.

413
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,660
We've got air-conditioning.
Is that air conditioning?

414
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:17,540
Or just stuff to make noise
so we get bad sound.

415
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,700
The sound is terrible here.

416
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:23,420
It's closed
and it still echoes.

417
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:27,260
That was the first thing we said
when we got here.

418
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,820
This is a warehouse.

419
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:34,340
So I don't know how we do this.
Because the sets have got to be...

420
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,820
not that.

421
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,780
There's no other studios?

422
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:41,780
Properly done, properly, everything...

423
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,780
I mean sound is critical.

424
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,820
I mean I thought
we were coming to a studio.

425
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,580
A studio.
This isn't a studio.

426
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,730
I don't want to be doing
a film like this.

427
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:58,900
I'm really getting a bit,
getting very nervous.

428
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:28,420
I think all versions of Quixote
have always been plagued

429
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:33,780
by bad things. It's kind of like
the Scottish play, I think.

430
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,940
It is a jinxed project.

431
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:40,460
The biggest threat of this whole thing is
that, I fear, it could be Munchausen II.

432
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:43,940
There's so many echoes of Munchausen
that just keep happening.

433
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,940
And that's what scares me.

434
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:50,260
Luckily, those who weren't on
Munchausen, aren't scared.

435
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:54,140
And actually interesting, Jose Luis,
who was on Munchausen, isn't scared.

436
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,900
We are on the edge, yes,

437
00:32:55,901 --> 00:32:57,301
We are on the edge, that's for sure.

438
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:00,460
We are not well covered,
that's for sure.

439
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,460
But I don't think that means

440
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:05,060
that we are repeating Munchausen.

441
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:08,320
Everyone knew on Munchausen,
from the beginning,

442
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:11,660
from the beginning that
nothing was realistic.

443
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,980
No, I don't think we
are in the same...

444
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:19,940
the same things
are happening at all, no.

445
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:30,140
We fill that in so it's solid.

446
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,980
You can't go wrong.

447
00:33:31,981 --> 00:33:34,981
It goes in there, another arm
starts flailing and that arm's caught.

448
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,060
OK, Giant test.

449
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,420
What more do you want?

450
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,460
It's OK.

451
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,030
He was asking if you knew...

452
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,740
Who he was going to... He was just
telling you, he's going to take Johnny Depp.

453
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,180
- Carnivorous.
- Si.

454
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,400
Jean Rochefort was getting
on a plane yesterday,

455
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:19,500
so I get a call yesterday afternoon
from Rene Cleitman...

456
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,580
saying "Guess what...

457
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:27,020
Jean, as he was about to board the plane,
started feeling pain,

458
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,780
and decided he might
have a prostate problem.

459
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:34,160
And canceled the flight,
didn't get on the flight,

460
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,980
and is now seeing
a doctor this morning."

461
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,860
If he hesitates about
getting on a plane, I'll call him.

462
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:45,940
As soon as he sees the doctor,
I will tell you.

463
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,960
You have to say "I need you."

464
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,300
We've got to at least get
a few hours with him today,

465
00:35:50,301 --> 00:35:52,201
or we're in big trouble.

466
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:57,460
But what's interesting is how
powerful his mind is.

467
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,780
It's destroying his body right now.

468
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,380
It's a metamorphosis.

469
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,740
He suffers, like Don Quixote.

470
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,420
I'm going to kill him.

471
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,420
It's ridiculous.

472
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:16,460
Jean has become totally
psychosomatic. Everything is like...

473
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:29,970
On Munchausen,
we didn't have costumes or sets

474
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:30,940
in the beginning.

475
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:35,560
And now this one, we don't have actors.
We've got costumes and sets, but no actors.

476
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:39,160
Jean Rochefort panicked on Sunday.

477
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:43,980
I am very calm.

478
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,180
Nothing like
a false sense of security.

479
00:36:51,181 --> 00:36:53,181
There's none of that around here,
is there?

480
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:57,420
I don't think there's any sense of security,
false or real.

481
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:04,340
How would you describe
the state of things?

482
00:37:04,341 --> 00:37:05,941
Sheer panic.

483
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:11,060
Like total panic. Chickens with
no heads running around.

484
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,540
I mean it is real panic now.

485
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:17,500
It's one week before production,
what's worrying you the most?

486
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:20,660
- Pre-production.
- Tell the truth.

487
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,380
The first location that we shoot in

488
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:26,400
is adjacent to a
NATO bombing ground,

489
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:30,780
so I was told it only operated
a maximum of one hour per day.

490
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:33,380
We don't really have any horses.

491
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,540
We don't really have any actors.

492
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,500
I have a phone.

493
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:42,301
Hello?

494
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,740
How are you?

495
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:47,860
I got an actor.
I have an actor. He's sitting here.

496
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:51,940
Yeah, last time, I know, he didn't have
an actor last time, now we got an actor.

497
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,420
You're the new boy in town.

498
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,860
- This is called our film.
- What's the name of it?

499
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,340
It's not Chocolat.

500
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,940
Oh, did I finished that one?

501
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:07,620
This is the inn. But there's gonna be
a herd of sheep in the inn.

502
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:10,380
For the lonely people.

503
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:14,340
This is Antonio Gil.
You know him, he was on Chocolat.

504
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:15,850
Yeah, that's a good guy.

505
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:19,790
- That's Bob Hoskins and...
- Danny DeVito.

506
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,290
- Ian Holm's...
- All put together.

507
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,660
- bastard child.
- And he's a dwarf.

508
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:27,880
- And he sings opera.
- Makes sense.

509
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:33,000
You spin around and Quixote
is already charging you.

510
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,280
It's not that he's standing there
saying "stand aside".

511
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,700
He's in full charge right at you.

512
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:40,580
I do not know what else
Toby should be doing.

513
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,440
You know what, I was thinking...

514
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,940
Toby's initial thing would be like...

515
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,100
maybe he's on a set of commercial.

516
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:52,260
What I was thinking maybe the first thing
he would do is want Bob to yell "Cut".

517
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,100
- "Bob! Cut, Bob!"
- That's great.

518
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,580
That's really great.

519
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:03,900
- Just to bring it back to that.
- That's really good.

520
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:07,060
There's got to be
an explanation for it.

521
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:10,620
And obviously here's Don Quixote and
there's the windmills and all that shit...

522
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:11,940
"Cut this."

523
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:16,860
Then it's clear that...
No, it's great. It's really nice.

524
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:28,220
While Gilliam and Depp
discuss the script,

525
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,860
Vanessa Paradis arrives
for screen tests

526
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:33,300
of her many make-up
and costume changes.

527
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:40,420
The production however is still missing
it's his Don Quixote.

528
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,000
Have you heard any more
about Jean?

529
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:49,900
Yes, because my assistant, Corinne,
went with him at the airport,

530
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,060
to be sure this time.

531
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,620
And he was in very good shape.

532
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:59,740
Is it really
a prostate infection?

533
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,300
So it's nothing more than
a small infection?

534
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:05,220
Ha can sit? The problem is,
can he sit on a horse?

535
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:09,220
It was panic.
There's always panic.

536
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:31,980
I like it uneven,
more irregular.

537
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:35,180
He made it. Don Quixote
made the armor.

538
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:37,260
One piece here,
one piece there,

539
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:42,300
sewing and...
"Ah, a knight!"

540
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:48,540
Even if you take this for the moment,
just to look... that piece on there...

541
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:52,820
Suddenly, immediately...
it's good.

542
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,120
We need...

543
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:02,660
So he just got a piece
tied on there.

544
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:08,220
That isn't much elegant.

545
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,340
He's got to be sad, pathetic.

546
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,620
And he's wonderful.
Because it's all in his mind.

547
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,780
We'll design this for you, Gabriella.

548
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:30,580
You'll get another Oscar.
Another Oscar for this.

549
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:34,660
It's getting there.
I think Don Quixote

550
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,940
slowly becomes real.

551
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:11,100
I'm here to save you, Sancho.
Stand aside!

552
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:16,520
Suddenly,
we are in the fields of Montiel.

553
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:19,500
Destiny guides our fortunes

554
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:22,860
more favorably than we could have
wished ourselves.

555
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:25,060
Look, Sancho, my friend!

556
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,740
A beautiful princess!

557
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:29,300
She's in great danger!

558
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:33,460
We must save her.
Those giants are almost upon her.

559
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:34,700
Don't you see them?

560
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:39,500
Giants! Giants with arms
six miles long!

561
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:44,020
Just face it,
Dulcinea del Toboso does not exist.

562
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:49,020
Now I understand.
You have a plan, Sancho.

563
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,180
You are very clever
for a peasant.

564
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:59,140
Fantastic!
It's going to be an extraordinary film.

565
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:03,820
Your face is so wondrous,

566
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,180
your eyes...

567
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:09,340
There's all this stuff and the costumes,
the sets, the location.

568
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,260
It's going to be an extraordinary film.

569
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:17,740
It's going to be beautiful
and terrible at the same time.

570
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:33,120
The shoot begins in Las Bardenas,

571
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:36,180
a natural preserve
4 hours north of Madrid.

572
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:40,720
Due to the distance, all the cast and crew
must be lodged nearby.

573
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:43,620
The extra expense makes it
all the more critical

574
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:46,021
that the production remains
on schedule.

575
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:02,800
The first scene to be shot,

576
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:07,060
is one in which Quixote rescues Toby,
from an inquisition chain gang.

577
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:23,060
D.O.S., D.O.S.,
Director On Set.

578
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,160
Let's clear please.

579
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:35,580
Everyone behind there.
Everybody hidden behind please.

580
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:40,700
We're shooting now.

581
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:43,180
You good, Carlos?

582
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:45,380
Alright, here we go.

583
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,320
Roll camera!

584
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:51,820
And action, Richard.

585
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:57,900
Action crane!

586
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:17,100
OK, cut it.

587
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:20,940
Excellent.

588
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:23,820
With the first shot of the day
in the can,

589
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:27,500
the crew prepares for a
choreographed portion of the scene.

590
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:32,980
In this part of the scene, one of the
guards drops the key to the chain

591
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:36,260
and the twelve prisoners must
scramble to retrieve it.

592
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:39,080
Cause he's the only one with the free hand,
everyone else has got two hands...

593
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:42,700
The guy in the front front
has got a free hand.

594
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:44,100
So it's a domino effect.

595
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:53,020
OK now, while that's going on,
what's happening here?

596
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:54,780
We got the key somewhere?

597
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:56,620
Who's got the key?

598
00:45:56,780 --> 00:46:00,220
Did we manage to get
the key to the lock?

599
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:04,420
How are we doing for time?

600
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:06,100
- Badly.
- Good.

601
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:10,100
On your feet. What happened to
you guys? No one's getting up?!

602
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:12,520
Don't make me start!
Wakey, wakey, folks!

603
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:15,780
People have to start getting up!
I thought this was rehearsed.

604
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,620
This is not rehearsed!

605
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:19,340
Fuck!

606
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:20,820
We didn't have the extras.

607
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:23,700
So we need to tell the extras
what we do. You see what I mean?

608
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,980
On Saturday we didn't
have the extras to rehearse?

609
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,460
No we didn't have the extras.

610
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:31,180
Since when? What was the point of
having a rehearsal without them?

611
00:46:31,281 --> 00:46:33,081
We couldn't get the extras.

612
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,380
You need extras to do the rehearsals.
If you don't get them,

613
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,260
you'd better tell us so that
we know in advance that we're fucked!

614
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:40,620
We are fucked!
And we didn't know it.

615
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:44,340
I want to know when we're fucked in advance
not in the middle of a shoot.

616
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,620
To try to get the most
out of the day,

617
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:53,700
Gilliam and Phil Patterson decide
to move on to another part of the scene.

618
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:57,260
- It's Jean Rochefort, not a double.
- Walking in.

619
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:00,780
Walking in, basically doing the dialogue,
doing the scene.

620
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:06,340
I mean it's a wide shot.
We go through all the action.

621
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:09,660
- And it is a master?
- This is a master.

622
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:11,660
Whatever we can get is good.

623
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:14,580
Lock it up everyone.
We're shooting now.

624
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:16,180
Background action!

625
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:20,700
Action, Jean!

626
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,940
Cut! What's going on?

627
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:48,820
We're fucked. We have now spent
all this time and we got fighters.

628
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:52,260
But we're doing the scene anyway.
I don't give a fuck about sound.

629
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:56,300
We will use the glazed-up sound.
We shoot through everything.

630
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:58,580
And we need people
who can work horses.

631
00:47:58,581 --> 00:48:01,181
I got a feeling
nobody can work horses here.

632
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:09,760
Action, Jean!

633
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:15,060
Move the horse.

634
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:17,020
Move the fucking horse!

635
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,580
Somebody push his horse.
Fuck, push his horse.

636
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:26,380
Tell me sir, why do you lead
these poor wretches in chains?

637
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:30,540
They are convicted criminals,
condemned to serve the king in his galleys.

638
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,780
I am Don Quixote de la Mancha,

639
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:37,340
dedicated to chivalry
and the protection of the weak!

640
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:41,700
No one make any sudden moves.

641
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:45,740
You have nothing to fear from me,
provided your intentions are honorable.

642
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:47,220
Thank God for that.

643
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,420
Cut! That's good. That's in there.

644
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:53,820
The F-16 gets the Academy Award!

645
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:55,940
Well done for putting up your voice.

646
00:48:56,220 --> 00:49:00,100
That was good. I want to do one more
and then I think we have this.

647
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:19,980
Alright let's stand by,
let's just check this opening position.

648
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:21,940
Everybody lean down.

649
00:49:30,041 --> 00:49:32,341
Ow! Fucker, that hurt!

650
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:35,700
Why am I being put
through this god-awful...?

651
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:38,700
Hi.
This isn't real.

652
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:40,940
It's just a dream.
Doesn't hurt.

653
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:42,060
Doesn't hurt.

654
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,460
Ow, Jesus Christ!

655
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:47,780
Don't blaspheme!

656
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:50,560
Cut! Let's go to lunch.

657
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:57,820
Very strange weather today.

658
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:01,140
Strange weather, strange horses.

659
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:03,540
This is going flat.

660
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:05,180
Slowly coming in?

661
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:09,860
Very hard to understand what
the boundaries are.

662
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:15,540
So what we're going to do is,
we start with you and Rocinante.

663
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:18,540
Two sizes.
One like this, and one like that.

664
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:23,860
Joe, you'll just be off-camera. We won't
have to worry about the other horse.

665
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:31,660
Got the same weather report

666
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:35,740
at lunchtime that I got yesterday...

667
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:39,980
- And the day before.
- Oh, it's always the same. Each day?

668
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:43,940
Well that's good. It's consistent.
We know what we're doing here.

669
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:46,140
Nice sound.

670
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:49,820
If it isn't the F-16s,
it's thunder.

671
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:54,720
You're right, Phil.

672
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:58,460
In another half hour, it'll be clear,
once this cloud comes over.

673
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:01,780
Lock it up everyone!
We're shooting now!

674
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:04,540
You good, Carlos?

675
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:07,020
Alright, here we go.

676
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:08,900
Rehearsal.

677
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:14,980
You have nothing to fear from me
provided your intentions are honorable.

678
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:16,340
Thank God for that.

679
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,220
We wouldn't stand a chance...

680
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:20,020
would we, boys?

681
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:24,900
It doesn't seem right that
honorable men like yourselves

682
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:30,460
should be the executioners of your
fellow men when they have not wronged you.

683
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,820
According to the duty of my profession,

684
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:41,460
I have no choice but to take
these men under my protection.

685
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,500
Yield to Heaven's command!

686
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:47,500
Ladies and gentlemen,
just listen up for a second.

687
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:52,940
I suspect there's a large bunch of lightning
and a storm about to hit us.

688
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:55,300
What I would like
everybody to do right now

689
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:57,920
is to make all the gear
completely safe.

690
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:00,960
Cover up. We're going to wait
for this lightning to pass,

691
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:02,920
see what the weather on
the other side of the front is,

692
00:52:02,921 --> 00:52:04,221
whether or not we can reconstitute,

693
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:06,820
but at the moment,
what I need everybody to do

694
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:10,340
is to make safe
and get under cover.

695
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:28,900
Which is it,
King Lear or The Wizard of Oz?

696
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:06,860
I don't know what we got out of this.
How much money we get insurance-wise?

697
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:08,660
We got to clear...

698
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:12,340
I mean all that gear is going to take...
a day? I have no idea.

699
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,460
We have to clean up everything
and it has to dry up.

700
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:19,380
Are we covered with insurance
for things like that?

701
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:33,380
Now look, we have to
come here in the morning

702
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:38,120
and see what we can do.
This could be dry. It may not.

703
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:39,100
Weather might be shitty.

704
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:42,380
It's going to be a mud hole.

705
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:44,900
It's not going to dry overnight.

706
00:54:45,601 --> 00:54:48,501
No. It's... no.

707
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:53,060
Interesting situation.

708
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:56,980
Almost checkmate,
but not quite.

709
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:01,060
We'll wriggle out of this somehow.

710
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:17,020
A call to the insurance company
has revealed,

711
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:20,580
that although the production is covered
for any damage to equipment,

712
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:22,420
they won't necessarily be covered

713
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:25,780
for the shooting time lost
due to acts of God.

714
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:28,620
In an attempt to salvage something
from the day

715
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:31,380
the producers have suggested
that they try to resume

716
00:55:31,381 --> 00:55:33,981
shooting parts of
the chain gang scene.

717
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:36,780
If we go ahead and try to shoot today,
we won't get that done.

718
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:39,700
We'll shoot half a day today,
we'll shoot half a day tomorrow.

719
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:41,740
and we'll probably not get Friday.

720
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:43,960
The correct way

721
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:49,880
to ensure that you continue on in a fully
and the most operational way you can,

722
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:54,060
is to take this day
to put the unit back together.

723
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:58,120
But don't you see, would it not have been
possible to go with a small unit?

724
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:00,740
No.
That's my answer: no.

725
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:04,300
And you can say that,
that you talked to me and I said no.

726
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,040
I agree that most of the crew

727
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:11,900
will have to reconcile everything,
but why didn't you risk 10 people

728
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:15,420
to shoot inside the taxi...

729
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:18,180
We need 10 people or 15 people.

730
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:22,660
This film unit is not able
to function today,

731
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:28,420
in any capacity except for maintenance
and putting ourselves back together.

732
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:45,460
Although the sets have finally
dried out,

733
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:49,240
the heavy rains have entirely
changed the color of the desert.

734
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:52,380
The landscape that Gilliam chose
for its starkness,

735
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:56,980
is now tinged with brown and green
and won't match what's already been shot.

736
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:00,940
To make matters worse,

737
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:04,820
the first part of the chain gang scene
was shot in bright sunlight

738
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:08,020
and now there's no sun at all.

739
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:13,820
It's wasted time to be honest,
because there is no light.

740
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:15,420
And I don't know if there ever will.

741
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:19,020
Do you think it would be possible,
just to anticipate,

742
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:21,940
to come back to the base camp,

743
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:26,540
and if the weather is keeping like that,

744
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:30,300
to try to re-shoot the sequence?

745
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:35,680
I know that the sequence is
with sunny weather,

746
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:38,060
but I don't think
we have other options.

747
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:39,660
If we want to do something...

748
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:42,820
I know, I know.

749
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:48,220
Here's a thought.

750
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:52,500
Taxi is bullshit.
We don't want to do taxi.

751
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:57,140
But we could do Johnny,
tighter shots, and light him,

752
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:58,420
even in this light.

753
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:01,980
- For which scene?
- Continuing the scene back there.

754
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:10,180
The crew decides to move camp
in order to shoot a different scene

755
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:12,500
which doesn't require bright sunlight.

756
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:16,060
The move will take several hours
out of their day.

757
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:52,660
We wait them out.
I don't want to waste time,

758
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:55,740
shooting dialogue
while that's going on.

759
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:57,660
No, we can't.

760
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:02,140
There's going to be
something else soon.

761
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:05,180
There'll be something else,
I do not know what it is, but...

762
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:08,580
Set there, ready to go.
These guys arrive.

763
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:11,820
And then we just started to
move into Munchausen.

764
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:21,540
Why don't we try to shoot this?

765
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:25,740
No, we were setting up
for that shot.

766
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:29,020
There's a plan, there's a very clear plan
what we're doing

767
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:31,580
and we're the victims of that.

768
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:36,180
If we keep running for each thing,
all we do is run in circles.

769
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:38,420
I don't know what else to do.

770
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:42,080
All of us have done a lot of stuff,
but none of us know the answer right now.

771
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:44,940
Everybody is just like...

772
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:24,900
Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we're
a minute away. Let's do final checks.

773
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:26,100
16!

774
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:37,060
Be steady, Sancho.
Trust me...

775
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:41,140
It may happen that before
we pass six days together,

776
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:43,860
I shall conquer a number of kingdoms.

777
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:45,260
Fuck you! We had a deal!

778
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:48,940
And your loyalty shall be rewarded.

779
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:50,360
Cut!

780
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:53,860
We're fucked!
Did you see him sit on the horse?

781
01:00:54,020 --> 01:00:56,300
- Fucking crazy!
- The pain when he sat down...

782
01:00:56,580 --> 01:00:59,300
He can't do it.
It ain't gonna happen.

783
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:04,020
I was watching his face very carefully
as he got on that horse and it was just...

784
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,700
Oh, fuck.

785
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:06,980
He can't ride like that,

786
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:11,060
he certainly can't act like that and he
certainly can't jiggle hand props with that.

787
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:13,460
Honestly I want to go
to the French and say,

788
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:17,020
"I'm going to refuse to shoot
with Jean Rochefort on a horse

789
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:18,620
until he is medically fit. "

790
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:24,140
The producers want to put him on the horse.
Terry wanted to put him on the horse.

791
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:26,420
Rochefort himself came
out of the trailer

792
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:29,600
and they put it to him
and he wanted to get on the horse.

793
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,720
And I just overruled Phil, I said
"OK, he's got to do it.

794
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:36,660
He's got to put somebody on film.
He's been working 7 months.

795
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:39,420
He hasn't a chance to do anything.
Let's do it."

796
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:46,740
Lock it up everyone!
We're shooting now!

797
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:48,500
Action.

798
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:53,540
It may happen that before
we spend six days together,

799
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:55,940
I shall conquer a number of kingdoms.

800
01:01:57,140 --> 01:01:59,740
I will crown you king of one of them.

801
01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:02,500
King!

802
01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:04,100
Cut.

803
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:06,180
That was nice.

804
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:09,260
- One more, okay?
- Yes, one more.

805
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:12,060
When it was time for him to get off,

806
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:15,740
it took two men to carry him off the horse
and put him in a chair.

807
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:19,660
Took him 40 minutes from there
to be able to walk to his car.

808
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:50,940
We're checking the gate, ladies and
gentlemen. Thank you very much.

809
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,260
I know it hasn't been
the best week for everybody.

810
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:58,260
I know it's been really, really difficult.
And I know we've had a lot of calamity.

811
01:02:58,420 --> 01:03:01,820
but I'd like to thank you all
very much for hanging in

812
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:06,020
and doing your bit.
And all I can tell you is

813
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:08,700
I'll endeavor to make it
better next week.

814
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:12,100
And I hope you'll join me
at Monasterio de Piedra

815
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:14,380
and we'll start making the film.

816
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:18,580
Thank you very much.
That's a warp. Let's pack it up.

817
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:21,060
Do we get snow next week?

818
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:32,860
Never, never, never,
in 22 years I've been in this business,

819
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:37,940
I've never seen such
a sum of "sfiga",

820
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:41,060
we say in Italian...
bad luck.

821
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:43,440
Sfiga is actually the better word
than bad luck.

822
01:03:43,441 --> 01:03:45,941
Because sfiga is the negation
of the pussy.

823
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:51,940
La figa is the pussy,
la sfiga is the negation of it.

824
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:55,520
Everything that can go wrong,
goes wrong.

825
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:59,220
I mean everything.
Everything, everything, everything.

826
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:01,100
If you write a script

827
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:03,940
and you think of
the worst possible situation,

828
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:06,100
you can't make it up.

829
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:12,540
I think storyboards is the only way
to get my brain together.

830
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:16,160
The producers are looking for
a solution to the film's problems.

831
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:19,300
And it's often the case on film productions,
that the first solution

832
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:21,620
is to replace
the assistant director.

833
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:26,100
In this case, Gilliam's right-hand man,
Phil Patterson.

834
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:29,100
I think that actually

835
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:32,300
if you fire him, he would be
very happy, the first reaction

836
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:35,060
then he probably would,
because he...

837
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:41,680
It's basically he's taking
all the responsibility on his shoulders.

838
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:45,100
And he's feeling it's a complete failure
and it's his fault.

839
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:46,700
And that's ridiculous.

840
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:48,600
That's where that's coming from.

841
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:53,300
That kind of sense of responsibility
and dedication is really rare.

842
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:02,100
Because Phil has been

843
01:05:02,101 --> 01:05:03,101
one of the few people

844
01:05:03,102 --> 01:05:04,302
holding this thing together.

845
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:07,660
His strength is that he
just won't let go, he'll keep going.

846
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:10,340
And if he can regain

847
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:14,660
some sense of being able
to control the mess...

848
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:17,180
I don't know...

849
01:05:23,060 --> 01:05:27,900
Later that day, Jean Rochefort
flies back Paris, to see his doctor.

850
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:30,740
Although Rochefort will be
returning in a few days,

851
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:33,180
his departure leave the production
in a quandary,

852
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:36,140
about what to do with
the next week's shoot.

853
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:39,140
I stated my opinion quite strongly
that we should pack up,

854
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:42,380
and we should take the unit
back to Madrid

855
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:47,540
and reconstitute ourselves and
make a decision about where we were going.

856
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:50,380
Any form of shooting was wasteful.

857
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:54,620
There's a lot of argument to say
"Cut and run now. Stop."

858
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:58,380
But I would rather keep shooting because
at least we're putting stuff on film,

859
01:05:58,540 --> 01:06:03,220
and we got people who just gave us
$16 million, coming down, 60 of them.

860
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:06,820
Yeah, we gotta shoot on Monday.
We have to shoot no matter what.

861
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:39,060
Welcome to Spain,
to the set of the movie.

862
01:06:40,820 --> 01:06:43,820
With Rochefort scheduled to return
in two days,

863
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:45,640
Gilliam and the producers have decided

864
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:48,940
to forge ahead and shoot the scenes
that don't require him.

865
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:51,820
They're especially concerned
that the location

866
01:06:51,821 --> 01:06:53,421
will be unusable
in a few weeks

867
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:55,860
when leaves begin to fall
from the trees.

868
01:06:56,380 --> 01:07:00,100
They also have their principal investors
visiting the set.

869
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:02,180
You fiddle with the fish.

870
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:05,540
He springs up and the horse comes up
and nudges you over that way.

871
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:07,940
So is that me?

872
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:12,420
I hope so. Or the horse.
He's very good. He's a professional.

873
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:15,460
Lock it up everyone.
We're shooting now.

874
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:21,500
I've loaded the fish.
The fish is loaded.

875
01:07:21,860 --> 01:07:23,180
Here we go.

876
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:25,340
Roll camera!

877
01:07:26,260 --> 01:07:27,540
Action.

878
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:37,660
Horse come on.
Come on horse, come on horse.

879
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:40,780
Cut it, cut it.

880
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:43,580
Let's do it again,
straight away.

881
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:44,700
Action.

882
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:46,980
Horse come on.

883
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:50,140
We're moving in.
Is the horse about to move?

884
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:55,020
Good, good, good idea.

885
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:56,980
Cut.

886
01:07:57,220 --> 01:07:59,580
Turn the camera on this.
Turn the camera on Johnny...

887
01:07:59,581 --> 01:08:01,981
...looks in.
Let's just get on with it.

888
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:05,440
Johnny gets in a close-up. We don't have to
be anywhere. Johnny can do it from here.

889
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:08,260
Leave the camera,
he turns in the camera and walks out.

890
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:11,700
Get some shots.
This is fucking stupid. Jesus!

891
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:15,140
As Gilliam troubleshoots the scene,

892
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:17,340
news arrives from Paris

893
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:22,020
that it will be at least a week before
Jean Rochefort is well enough to return.

894
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:24,340
You now what they're
going to ask us to do?

895
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:29,380
Then we got to cancel the film.

896
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:32,400
They're going to say,
let's start him off without...

897
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:53,540
It's a funnier look from there.

898
01:08:53,860 --> 01:08:56,900
But that was really good though.
Everything sort of fit.

899
01:08:57,220 --> 01:08:59,540
Lock it up everyone.
We're shooting now.

900
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:10,780
You want to fuck with me, huh?
Fucker!

901
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:12,780
What were you thinking?

902
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:14,060
What were you thinking?

903
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:18,740
And cut it!

904
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:21,460
- Cut it. Just cut it out.
- Ladies and gentlemen, that's a wrap.

905
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:25,860
I'm the football.

906
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:32,260
The team! Excellent.

907
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:37,060
I'll be down here, like this.

908
01:09:37,660 --> 01:09:42,180
OK, we give you one, two, three.
At three, I will be shooting, alright?

909
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:55,460
As the investors leave the set,
the insurance adjusters arrive.

910
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:58,500
They've come to investigate
last week's claims

911
01:09:58,660 --> 01:10:02,540
and to decide how to proceed
in Rochefort's absence.

912
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:09,100
Just so you know,
we're not going to shoot tomorrow.

913
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:12,480
So we're going to travel
back to Madrid.

914
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:17,500
Just check in with production
before you go.

915
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:20,700
8 o'clock, we meet at the base camp,

916
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:24,180
have breakfast together and
decide what to do.

917
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:25,860
Alright?

918
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:30,620
Meeting at 8 o'clock at the base camp,
have breakfast together.

919
01:10:31,780 --> 01:10:35,340
We'll see.
We're not shooting, but we'll see.

920
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:41,700
We don't known the state of
Jean Rochefort's health.

921
01:10:41,860 --> 01:10:45,980
We don't know whether he's going to
come back whole, or come back.

922
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:47,900
Or what. We don't know.

923
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:52,380
I mean, he's been tested,
prodded, probed, poked.

924
01:10:53,180 --> 01:10:56,660
And I suppose we'll know
in a couple more days what his state is.

925
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:19,420
In the book, Cervantes does something
very strange and very cruel.

926
01:11:19,580 --> 01:11:22,900
At every turn
Cervantes mocks Quixote.

927
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:28,380
At every turn, Cervantes goes out of his way
to show how foolish the old man is.

928
01:11:28,540 --> 01:11:32,220
And the crueler he is,
the more we love Quixote.

929
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:34,900
So that when this man becomes
sane at the end,

930
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:37,060
as the reader, we can't stand it.

931
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:39,660
We don't want him to be sane,
we want him to remain mad.

932
01:11:39,820 --> 01:11:42,940
because we know full well,
that when he is sane, he can die.

933
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:46,900
We're waiting to hear
what the doctor says.

934
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:48,660
What test he wants to do.

935
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:49,780
Or does he just say

936
01:11:49,781 --> 01:11:51,781
"Jean, you need to rest"?

937
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:53,360
We're just waiting to hear.

938
01:11:53,361 --> 01:11:54,861
Literally there's nothing to do.

939
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:57,900
On film productions,
a completion guarantor

940
01:11:58,060 --> 01:12:00,780
assumes financial responsibility
for ensuring

941
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:04,220
that a film will be completed
and delivered on schedule.

942
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:07,900
Fred Millstein has come to Madrid
to protect his assets

943
01:12:08,060 --> 01:12:11,900
and to help the production team
cope with the recent setbacks.

944
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:16,160
I think there is no worse situation

945
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:18,340
than not knowing anything.

946
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:21,060
So everyone is keeping asking every day

947
01:12:21,220 --> 01:12:22,540
"What do we have to do?"

948
01:12:22,541 --> 01:12:24,041
"When are we going to restart?"

949
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:26,940
And nobody is able to give an answer.

950
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:29,940
We don't know. We don't know.

951
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:32,860
No, that's all the news we have.

952
01:12:42,620 --> 01:12:45,060
Fantastic. Brilliant.

953
01:12:45,140 --> 01:12:46,840
Absolutely fantastic.

954
01:12:48,940 --> 01:12:50,020
They're wonderful.

955
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:53,680
I mean, I keep working.
I keep marching ahead.

956
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:56,160
It's the one thing I've always been
pretty good at,

957
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:59,140
is just to keep marching ahead
and doing it

958
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:01,420
and saying "Yeah, we can do it,
let's keep going, let's keep going."

959
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:06,320
We're not shooting Monday, Tuesday.
So you can have a holiday til then.

960
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:19,780
The production team has been working
to arrange a new schedule

961
01:13:19,860 --> 01:13:24,400
based on Rochefort's return, but the news
comes in from Rochefort's doctors

962
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:27,660
that he will not be returning
for at least 10 more days.

963
01:13:27,940 --> 01:13:31,420
And while the production continues to
spend money to keep the crew working,

964
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:35,060
the insurance company seems to be claiming
that Rochefort's illness

965
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:37,180
may be a "force majeure" event,

966
01:13:37,340 --> 01:13:40,260
an act of God,
not covered by the policy.

967
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:44,180
His opinions is more that,
there's an insured event.

968
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:46,160
It's not "force majeure".

969
01:13:46,780 --> 01:13:48,540
It needs to be defined.

970
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:53,380
But clearly, it's for acts of God.

971
01:13:53,490 --> 01:13:58,300
And he doesn't think the illness
of another actor is a force majeure event.

972
01:13:58,740 --> 01:14:04,620
The "force majeure",
it's necessary to have a definition

973
01:14:04,780 --> 01:14:06,620
for the force majeure
to be applicable.

974
01:14:06,740 --> 01:14:10,940
He was looking at the contract
and he said there is no definition,

975
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,040
no real definition of the
force majeure. In that case,

976
01:14:14,741 --> 01:14:17,741
for him,
it's not applicable at all.

977
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:20,900
My feeling, or my wish
more than my feeling,

978
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:25,680
is that we should at least
stop for a few weeks or months

979
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:27,460
and reorganize everything, because,

980
01:14:27,620 --> 01:14:32,020
of course the location now is a big mess
cast is a big mess, crew is a big mess,

981
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:34,880
The best thing for everybody,
and for the film,

982
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:38,800
would to be able to stop, but I know
that financially, that's a lot of money.

983
01:14:38,820 --> 01:14:42,660
The insurance company was saying
"Hold on, you have to be very careful.

984
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:48,180
Keep everybody on track,
but on the other hand, don't spend money."

985
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:53,620
The question is
whether they would re-insure Jean.

986
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:56,020
That's the problem.

987
01:14:56,180 --> 01:14:59,340
Then the pressure
would be to re-cast

988
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:02,020
and that's what
I don't want to do.

989
01:15:02,180 --> 01:15:04,460
And I don't even know
who can do the job.

990
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:07,940
We spent a long time
coming to Jean Rochefort.

991
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:10,540
He spent a year and a half
thinking about it

992
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:14,140
and 7 months learning English
and he's magnificent.

993
01:15:15,140 --> 01:15:19,820
Another problem with recasting the film,
is that Gilliam, Depp and Rochefort

994
01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:23,340
are what are contractually known
as essential elements.

995
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:28,420
If any one of them leaves the project,
the film must be entirely refinanced.

996
01:16:23,940 --> 01:16:27,580
The idea is to reschedule
the film as soon as possible.

997
01:16:27,740 --> 01:16:29,900
Check with everybody,
actors,

998
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:35,100
all the departments and locations
about their availability of the new schedule

999
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:38,140
based on starting on the 16th.

1000
01:16:38,420 --> 01:16:40,680
What's happening if Jean
is not back on the 16th?

1001
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:42,500
There are many possibilities.

1002
01:16:42,780 --> 01:16:44,500
The film is going to be done.
It doesn't matter how.

1003
01:16:44,660 --> 01:16:46,020
The film is going to be done.

1004
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:20,380
I'd just like to know, for the record,
where is the director of this film?

1005
01:17:26,020 --> 01:17:30,060
This is no way to make a film,
even a small film.

1006
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:34,540
To make one like this, it's impossible.

1007
01:17:35,260 --> 01:17:39,780
The fact is, nothing is pushing us right
now. There's no motor anymore in this.

1008
01:17:39,940 --> 01:17:43,140
We're just waiting for the insurance
to tell us what to do.

1009
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:46,820
Nobody seems to be in control,
of anything.

1010
01:17:48,060 --> 01:17:51,540
I like shooting things, even if it's
completely fucked up and totally useless.

1011
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:54,780
At least, there's images.
Something to pay...

1012
01:17:54,940 --> 01:17:58,460
to justify the several years of work.

1013
01:18:00,380 --> 01:18:02,320
So much denial going on.

1014
01:18:02,380 --> 01:18:06,020
You know, the fact, the 27th of November,
Jean Rochefort is going to be back,

1015
01:18:06,180 --> 01:18:08,540
dancing, jumping on the horse.

1016
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:09,580
Forget about it!

1017
01:18:09,740 --> 01:18:14,880
I mean, accept the idea this man
won't be fit to make the movie.

1018
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:42,740
No, but see, the problem is,
we had force majeure last weekend and

1019
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:46,100
we should have used that
in order to straighten house.

1020
01:18:46,380 --> 01:18:49,410
And when I say to Bernard,
like I did today, "Bernard,

1021
01:18:49,420 --> 01:18:53,380
"tell me now, tell me straight to
my face that if Rochefort comes back,

1022
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:56,540
"and we have him on the set,
and I turn to you

1023
01:18:56,700 --> 01:18:58,860
"as the first AD,
on the set,

1024
01:18:59,020 --> 01:19:02,380
"and say 'this man is
incapable of working',

1025
01:19:02,540 --> 01:19:04,400
"are you going to sail me
down the tube again?

1026
01:19:04,501 --> 01:19:06,701
"Are you going to vote
against my decision?"

1027
01:19:06,860 --> 01:19:10,780
- And I'm trying to remain...
- You're not fully succeeding.

1028
01:19:10,940 --> 01:19:14,300
- somewhat rational...
- Somewhat is good enough.

1029
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:16,820
Here's what's making me crazy.

1030
01:19:16,980 --> 01:19:19,940
Okay, we've stopped shooting and
now we're reorganizing ourselves.

1031
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,860
Well, are we
reorganizing ourselves?

1032
01:19:21,861 --> 01:19:23,061
- No.
- No.

1033
01:19:23,140 --> 01:19:25,900
That's what pisses me off,
this is the whole point of the time,

1034
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:31,500
is to go through and get ourselves in
fighting, fit shape to actually do the film.

1035
01:19:31,660 --> 01:19:33,300
and nothing is happening.

1036
01:19:33,460 --> 01:19:36,380
We're running around in circles.

1037
01:19:36,540 --> 01:19:38,460
And the days are just
floating past.

1038
01:19:38,470 --> 01:19:40,660
And we're getting in worse shape
than we were when we stopped.

1039
01:19:40,820 --> 01:19:45,420
I don't know how one gets out.
Not having been in this stuff before.

1040
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:49,620
I plowed on. And I don't have any energy
to plow on at the moment.

1041
01:19:49,630 --> 01:19:52,880
- This isn't a plowable...
- Yeah, I know. I know that.

1042
01:19:52,940 --> 01:19:56,240
So I don't know how a plug
gets pulled on a thing like this.

1043
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:05,080
Look, I'm going to go back to Algete
and I'm going to tell the French producers

1044
01:20:05,140 --> 01:20:09,760
that I'm not going to
continue in the project the way it is.

1045
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:12,980
And explain to them the reason
that I'm leaving the film

1046
01:20:12,981 --> 01:20:15,281
is that I don't have confidence
in the producers

1047
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:19,340
to support me in the decisions that need
to be made in terms of making the film.

1048
01:20:23,860 --> 01:20:27,600
We can't make the film.
Not the film you want to make.

1049
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:33,140
You know, I'm sorry to be,

1050
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:37,500
as always,
the bearer of bad tidings.

1051
01:20:37,801 --> 01:20:39,101
Whatever, but...

1052
01:21:16,540 --> 01:21:19,740
I don't know anymore.
I've lost it completely.

1053
01:21:20,020 --> 01:21:22,420
I can't imagine the film anymore.
That's my problem.

1054
01:21:23,140 --> 01:21:26,040
Yeah. Exactly.

1055
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:29,740
And now everyone's limping off
to other jobs already.

1056
01:21:32,780 --> 01:21:36,900
Have you heard any more since the fact that
doctors are just doing more tests today?

1057
01:21:38,020 --> 01:21:40,780
Yeah, for the insurers
all going to Paris tomorrow.

1058
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:46,780
It's almost like
I've forgotten about this film.

1059
01:21:46,940 --> 01:21:51,300
It's like it doesn't exist, it can't exist.
Because if it does exist, it's too painful.

1060
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:53,780
I'll just hang around here.

1061
01:21:56,620 --> 01:22:00,220
Okay. Alright, thanks. Bye.

1062
01:22:07,820 --> 01:22:12,740
Well, the insurers are all
meeting in Paris tomorrow.

1063
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:18,220
Rene's going up there to
decide what to do.

1064
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:22,900
But there's been a little complication -
Fred Millstein, the completion bond...

1065
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:27,300
guy has been down here
the last few days, trying to...

1066
01:22:28,660 --> 01:22:30,260
sort things out.

1067
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:32,810
He was saying something to Jose

1068
01:22:32,820 --> 01:22:35,700
about the fact that
the paperwork isn't quite correct

1069
01:22:35,701 --> 01:22:37,901
between him and
the insurance company.

1070
01:22:38,060 --> 01:22:41,660
And it could mean that he's
going to get stuck with the bill.

1071
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:44,700
Which would be
disastrous for him, because

1072
01:22:44,860 --> 01:22:48,980
he's not protected in the way
insurance companies are.

1073
01:22:51,020 --> 01:22:54,540
And Jose is saying of course he will
fight it and it may end up in court,

1074
01:22:54,550 --> 01:22:57,100
with them fighting over
who picks up the pieces,

1075
01:22:57,260 --> 01:23:02,220
or picks up the pieces of paper
that need paying.

1076
01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:07,300
It's like there's
this curse of Quixote.

1077
01:23:07,460 --> 01:23:09,900
Going on around us.
Interesting.

1078
01:23:12,980 --> 01:23:15,060
Listen to that wind.

1079
01:23:15,220 --> 01:23:17,300
It started with the deluge,

1080
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:20,060
and now the great wind
is sweeping it clean,

1081
01:23:20,220 --> 01:23:23,540
blowing Quixote
out of Spain, forever.

1082
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:26,100
It's howling out there "It's over."

1083
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:38,580
By the end of October, it's clear
that Rochefort will not return.

1084
01:23:38,740 --> 01:23:42,300
He's been diagnosed with
a double herniated disc.

1085
01:23:42,460 --> 01:23:45,660
And it requires at least
another month of recovery.

1086
01:23:48,260 --> 01:23:50,980
What is the state
of the film now?

1087
01:24:12,980 --> 01:24:16,820
Often, when you have
problems in prep

1088
01:24:16,980 --> 01:24:19,880
and when you have
a shaky film production

1089
01:24:19,940 --> 01:24:22,880
the usual catch cry
of the film is

1090
01:24:22,981 --> 01:24:25,181
"Let's start shooting
and straighten it out."

1091
01:24:25,340 --> 01:24:28,820
Always in the belief that
to begin filming will

1092
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:32,540
help you get on track and
send you down one path.

1093
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:34,820
The old "train theory".

1094
01:24:35,980 --> 01:24:37,140
It didn't work this time.

1095
01:24:37,420 --> 01:24:40,540
Jean Rochefort was
the sort of tragic end to it.

1096
01:24:40,620 --> 01:24:44,340
A series of problems
that beset the film quite early on.

1097
01:24:46,820 --> 01:24:51,460
Maybe the only real responsibility of Terry
is about all this mess,

1098
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:54,660
that is in order
to make it happen,

1099
01:24:54,820 --> 01:24:58,680
I believe he lowered too much
his targets.

1100
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:02,840
And he gave an impression of
being about to do

1101
01:25:02,860 --> 01:25:05,700
a more simple movie
than it is.

1102
01:25:05,860 --> 01:25:09,340
Because again, it's been going on
for so long for him.

1103
01:25:09,420 --> 01:25:14,180
I mean that's what we don't consider,
for him, this is not the first time.

1104
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:20,740
Terry is very good at being proud
of how impossible something might be,

1105
01:25:20,900 --> 01:25:25,140
but no director is going to start a picture
thinking "we may not ever get through this".

1106
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:28,340
It was very painful
to see it all coming horribly true.

1107
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:29,580
Like I say, it was...

1108
01:25:29,581 --> 01:25:33,381
the most painful thing was seeing
reality win over Don Quixote in the end.

1109
01:25:33,540 --> 01:25:34,740
Because it did.

1110
01:25:59,540 --> 01:26:01,720
I honestly don't know
what I'd like to see happen

1111
01:26:01,780 --> 01:26:03,000
I suppose on one hand,

1112
01:26:03,001 --> 01:26:06,501
I'd like Jean to get better
and us to be able to make the film

1113
01:26:08,020 --> 01:26:12,940
And that would be... on the other hand,
I don't know. I mean I just like...

1114
01:26:13,100 --> 01:26:16,380
I've done the film too often
in my head, too many times.

1115
01:26:16,540 --> 01:26:19,180
I've seen it, I've been through it,
I know how it goes.

1116
01:26:21,660 --> 01:26:26,300
Is it better, you know, to just
leave it there? I really don't know.

1117
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:04,001
.
