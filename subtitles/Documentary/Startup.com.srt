00:00:05,134 --> 00:00:06,966
<i>Rask: One job. You get your shit back,</i>

2
00:00:06,967 --> 00:00:08,509
I don't chase you anymore. How's that?

3
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:10,110
Izzy: We need to
move on without you, dude,

4
00:00:10,134 --> 00:00:12,300
- 'cause we landed Benedict
Blush for 1.5. - Nick: Yes.

5
00:00:12,342 --> 00:00:13,776
This is good. We back in business.

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,799
- There's no "we."
- I reject your offer.

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,966
I won't say anything.

8
00:00:16,967 --> 00:00:19,342
- Maddie.
- Please. Phil, don't go!

9
00:00:19,425 --> 00:00:21,134
Not 2.2 here.

10
00:00:21,217 --> 00:00:22,883
Only 1.8.

11
00:00:22,925 --> 00:00:25,133
Izzy: Someone's hacking my
shit! They're taking all our money!

12
00:00:25,134 --> 00:00:27,110
Nick: You said this couldn't
happen! Who's doing it?

13
00:00:27,134 --> 00:00:28,592
- That 300.
- Yeah?

14
00:00:28,633 --> 00:00:30,753
Where's it at? Is it at your
place? I'mma need that.

15
00:00:34,092 --> 00:00:36,842
I'll give you three days.

16
00:00:36,883 --> 00:00:38,568
Phil: Well, I think we're
done here. You can go.

17
00:00:38,592 --> 00:00:40,312
She have to die.
You know she have to die.

18
00:00:41,425 --> 00:00:43,217
Phil Rask!

19
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:44,509
No!

20
00:00:56,342 --> 00:00:57,509
Izzy: I tried everything.

21
00:00:57,592 --> 00:00:59,134
Traced every packet.

22
00:00:59,175 --> 00:01:02,134
It all leads to this one
signature... "Daewon."

23
00:01:04,967 --> 00:01:06,551
What does that mean?

24
00:01:06,592 --> 00:01:08,134
"Daewon"?

25
00:01:08,217 --> 00:01:09,425
Who?

26
00:01:09,467 --> 00:01:10,633
He's a black hat, Nick.

27
00:01:10,675 --> 00:01:12,633
He's the most wanted
hacker in the world.

28
00:01:12,675 --> 00:01:14,425
He raped us and took all our money.

29
00:01:14,467 --> 00:01:15,967
Why us? I don't even understand.

30
00:01:16,008 --> 00:01:18,300
I mean, we're not a known entity.

31
00:01:18,342 --> 00:01:20,217
It's not like we're holding billions.

32
00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:21,842
Someone had to know.

33
00:01:21,883 --> 00:01:23,842
Someone who'd been following the money.

34
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,632
You said it was safe.

35
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,651
- That's not what I said.
- Yes, you did. Yes, you did.

36
00:01:33,675 --> 00:01:35,133
You said it would be in

37
00:01:35,134 --> 00:01:37,425
decentralized shell corps, very safe.
- Not from Daewon.

38
00:01:37,467 --> 00:01:39,675
It's not safe from him!
Nothing is safe from him!

39
00:01:39,758 --> 00:01:41,509
Goddammit, man! I trusted you!

40
00:01:41,592 --> 00:01:44,883
- Ronald and I both, we really, really
trusted you. - I got beat! Damn!

41
00:01:44,925 --> 00:01:46,217
This isn't a game.

42
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:49,384
1.5 million. An
investor gave this to us.

43
00:01:49,425 --> 00:01:51,217
Not to mention Ronald's cut, which...

44
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:54,925
Holy shit! Holy shit!

45
00:01:54,967 --> 00:01:56,257
- We'll get it back.
- I...

46
00:01:56,397 --> 00:01:57,927
I'm gonna figure it out and I'm

47
00:01:57,952 --> 00:01:59,706
- gonna get it back.
- Okay. You better.

48
00:02:01,008 --> 00:02:02,050
I better?

49
00:02:02,092 --> 00:02:04,675
I am on the hook
for this money, okay?

50
00:02:04,716 --> 00:02:05,956
You're threatening me?

51
00:02:05,957 --> 00:02:07,401
I am not threatening you.
I am being threatened.

52
00:02:07,425 --> 00:02:08,883
- Get... get out.
- What? What?

53
00:02:08,967 --> 00:02:10,466
- Get out.
- What's your problem?

54
00:02:10,467 --> 00:02:12,133
- Get out. Get out.
- I'm not threatening you!

55
00:02:12,134 --> 00:02:13,318
- Get out.
- I'm being threatened!

56
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:14,842
I don't care.

Hey, I'm so sorry.

62
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,175
I should have called.

63
00:04:09,217 --> 00:04:10,467
Hey. Where are you?

64
00:04:10,509 --> 00:04:12,509
<i>Nick on phone: I was, uh, working.</i>

65
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:14,800
I was... we were working
on a presentation

66
00:04:14,842 --> 00:04:17,299
and my phone was... it died.

67
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,300
Sorry.

68
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:20,134
Okay, well, are you coming home?

69
00:04:20,175 --> 00:04:22,342
Yeah. Yeah, I'm
coming home very soon.

70
00:04:22,425 --> 00:04:23,509
I'm really sorry.

71
00:04:23,592 --> 00:04:25,425
Well, your friend is here to see you.

72
00:04:25,467 --> 00:04:27,300
He says his name is Ronald.

73
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:31,925
Oh. He's... there.

74
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:33,133
Uh... Um...

75
00:04:33,134 --> 00:04:34,168
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Okay.

76
00:04:34,328 --> 00:04:35,808
All right, I'll be home...
I'll be home right now.

77
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:37,633
- Okay.
- <i>Okay.</i>

78
00:04:43,217 --> 00:04:45,342
He said he's just
gonna be a couple of minutes.

79
00:04:47,842 --> 00:04:49,384
- (knocking)
- Adolfo: Izzy?

80
00:04:49,425 --> 00:04:50,967
We'd like to talk to you.

81
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:53,300
<i>Marta: Chica?</i>

82
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:01,632
Aye, mija.

83
00:05:01,633 --> 00:05:02,967
Izzy.

84
00:05:03,008 --> 00:05:05,342
Por favor, talk to us, please.

85
00:05:05,425 --> 00:05:06,425
Isabelle.

86
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,633
How much do you owe?

87
00:05:12,384 --> 00:05:13,551
A lot.

88
00:05:15,925 --> 00:05:18,592
To whom? Who are these people?

89
00:05:18,633 --> 00:05:19,758
Should we call Miguel?

90
00:05:20,758 --> 00:05:22,425
Marta: No. No.

91
00:05:22,467 --> 00:05:23,842
- Marta.
- No.

92
00:05:23,883 --> 00:05:25,675
We're never borrowing
money from them again.

93
00:05:25,716 --> 00:05:27,758
I don't mean for money.

94
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,300
Marta: Oh, my god.

95
00:05:29,342 --> 00:05:30,883
Is this what it's like?

96
00:05:30,925 --> 00:05:32,259
Is it?

97
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,716
No. No, no, no. Not really.

98
00:05:35,883 --> 00:05:38,008
Oh, my god, oh, my god, Isabelle!

99
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,842
Mija, I told you, okay?

100
00:05:39,883 --> 00:05:42,050
This is not a game.
These are real consequences.

101
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:43,799
Mom, I know! Chill!

102
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,633
I know. I... I know, though.

103
00:05:45,675 --> 00:05:46,966
I just gotta talk to them.

104
00:05:46,967 --> 00:05:49,300
I... I... it's gonna be fine.

105
00:05:49,342 --> 00:05:50,342
It's gonna be fine.

106
00:05:50,425 --> 00:05:51,799
I gotta find a way to make quick cash,

107
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,632
I will pay it off
eventually, and we'll square off.

108
00:05:54,633 --> 00:05:56,883
Izzy, what about
your friends from Stanford?

109
00:05:56,925 --> 00:05:58,883
Can... can't they get you a job?

110
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:01,632
Listen, we'll take a second mortgage.

111
00:06:01,633 --> 00:06:02,842
We'll help you out.

112
00:06:06,217 --> 00:06:08,110
Izzy, what are you doing?
We're talking to you.

113
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:09,509
- Izzy...
- I'm pinging Maya.

114
00:06:09,551 --> 00:06:10,551
She runs RadCoin.

115
00:06:11,551 --> 00:06:12,592
Marta: Uh...

116
00:06:12,633 --> 00:06:14,842
My friend from Stanford.

117
00:06:14,883 --> 00:06:16,175
It's a good idea.

118
00:06:48,592 --> 00:06:50,259
What's up, South Beach?

119
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,467
You just getting home? For real?

120
00:06:54,134 --> 00:06:56,633
You had your woman worried, bruh.

121
00:06:56,675 --> 00:06:58,633
If I go dark on my woman that long,

122
00:06:58,675 --> 00:07:01,509
she'd whoop my damn ass.

123
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:03,883
Yeah, Taylor and I, we just
been... oh, shit, sorry,

124
00:07:03,967 --> 00:07:05,134
it's Taylor, right?

125
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,509
Yeah.

126
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:09,967
Yeah, Taylor and I, we were
just speaking about you.

127
00:07:10,008 --> 00:07:11,966
Your ears must have
been burning and shit.

128
00:07:11,967 --> 00:07:14,110
Hey, baby, would you mind going
inside for just a minute?

129
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:16,467
Hey, no, no, no, no,
she gonna stay here.

130
00:07:17,633 --> 00:07:18,967
What are you doing?

131
00:07:20,551 --> 00:07:22,633
I'm here to talk business.

132
00:07:22,716 --> 00:07:25,110
Well, then I would like my girlfriend
to go inside for the time being.

133
00:07:25,134 --> 00:07:26,651
- Hey, that's your girl, dawg.
- Hey, hey, hey!

134
00:07:26,675 --> 00:07:27,734
This is a private conversation.

135
00:07:27,758 --> 00:07:30,008
And she supposed to be with you.

136
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,675
By your side. Thick and thin.

137
00:07:32,716 --> 00:07:34,300
God damn!

138
00:07:35,716 --> 00:07:38,175
Didn't even tell her you quit your job.

139
00:07:41,384 --> 00:07:42,675
Now sit down.

140
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,425
Why are you here?

141
00:07:58,925 --> 00:08:00,967
I've been thinking it over.

142
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,800
I will take that buyout after all.

143
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:06,134
And I understand everything
with the banks and cash and all that,

144
00:08:06,217 --> 00:08:08,259
but as soon as you can get that to me...

145
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,134
Ronald.

146
00:08:10,175 --> 00:08:12,633
Aw, man, we have a small problem.

147
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,008
- Word?
- Yeah.

148
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,967
Well, it's actually... It's actually a...

149
00:08:18,008 --> 00:08:19,050
It's a huge problem.

150
00:08:19,092 --> 00:08:20,425
Uh...

151
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:21,758
we just got hacked

152
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,217
and someone... this a hacker guy...

153
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:28,217
I mean, he took all of it.

154
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,967
"All of it." That's what's up?

155
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:34,175
Uh-huh.

156
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:36,509
GenCoin. My money.

157
00:08:36,592 --> 00:08:38,800
That Blush dude money.
All of that money?

158
00:08:38,842 --> 00:08:41,633
That money you was
gonna give me yesterday

159
00:08:41,716 --> 00:08:43,632
when you and homegirl fired me...

160
00:08:43,633 --> 00:08:45,966
- Well, we didn't fire you, but yeah.
- Yes, you did, Nick.

161
00:08:45,967 --> 00:08:47,217
You fired my Haitian ass.

162
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:48,467
- No, no.
- You tried to.

163
00:08:48,551 --> 00:08:50,068
We offered you a
buyout. We didn't fire you.

164
00:08:50,092 --> 00:08:51,092
We didn't even hire you.

165
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,592
You listen to me right now.

166
00:08:55,633 --> 00:08:57,300
(grunts)

167
00:08:57,342 --> 00:08:58,842
You and that mouthy-ass bitch

168
00:08:58,883 --> 00:09:01,342
told me my money was gonna be
safer than it's ever been.

169
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,551
Now what?

170
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:08,633
Now what?

171
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:12,800
No, wait! Taylor, no cops! No cops!

172
00:09:12,842 --> 00:09:14,151
No, you don't want to do that, girl.

173
00:09:14,175 --> 00:09:15,300
(Taylor gasps)

174
00:09:15,342 --> 00:09:16,342
(splash)

175
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:21,259
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

176
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:34,259
You get me my money.

177
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,342
Just 'cause I like you
don't mean I won't put you down.

178
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:43,592
Thanks for the snacks. You a good girl.

179
00:09:45,175 --> 00:09:46,716
Don't let this nigga forget that.

180
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,466
- (sighs)
- It's okay.

181
00:09:54,467 --> 00:09:56,008
- I'm sorry.
- Nick.

182
00:09:56,092 --> 00:09:58,632
- I'm sorry.
- Stop it.

183
00:09:58,633 --> 00:10:00,273
- It's okay. I'm...
- Just don't touch me.

184
00:10:01,425 --> 00:10:02,925
I'm sorry.

185
00:10:05,592 --> 00:10:07,050
Oh, gosh.

186
00:10:18,259 --> 00:10:19,842
(distant barking)

187
00:10:41,175 --> 00:10:45,633
(breathes deeply)

188
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,967
(exhales)

189
00:11:55,633 --> 00:11:56,842
(grunts)

190
00:12:00,716 --> 00:12:01,675
(grunts)

191
00:12:09,883 --> 00:12:12,133
Maya: So you remember Donnie, right?

192
00:12:12,134 --> 00:12:13,758
Izzy: What?

193
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,384
Yes. The old spark was still there.

194
00:12:15,425 --> 00:12:16,799
Donnie? That's...

195
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,609
Yeah. I never thought I'd
be married this young.

196
00:12:18,633 --> 00:12:20,175
Or at all.

197
00:12:20,217 --> 00:12:21,030
Hm. Well...

198
00:12:21,055 --> 00:12:23,468
It's crazy how fast
life comes at you, right?

199
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,425
Well, how about you?

200
00:12:25,467 --> 00:12:27,300
- Not. Mm-mm.
- No?

201
00:12:27,342 --> 00:12:28,467
No, not for me.

202
00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:30,800
That's okay. That's good. Priorities.

203
00:12:30,842 --> 00:12:32,342
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

204
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:33,651
I'm really glad you called, Izzy.

205
00:12:33,675 --> 00:12:34,966
I've missed you, you know?

206
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:36,466
You up and bailed on Stanford.

207
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:37,799
(chuckles)

208
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,384
It... it wasn't my jam, I guess.

209
00:12:40,467 --> 00:12:41,966
I know. I get it.

210
00:12:41,967 --> 00:12:43,466
Yeah. Are you hungry?

211
00:12:43,467 --> 00:12:44,966
I'm starving. Want to get some food?

212
00:12:44,967 --> 00:12:46,425
No, I'm good, but... oh, go ahead.

213
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:47,509
- Excuse me.
- Man: Yeah?

214
00:12:47,592 --> 00:12:48,925
- Maya: Hi.
- Man: What can I get for you?

215
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:50,515
Can I get an order
of the hummus, please?

216
00:12:50,539 --> 00:12:51,110
Sure, sure.

217
00:12:51,134 --> 00:12:52,758
- Coming right up.
- Maya: Thanks.

218
00:12:54,633 --> 00:12:56,632
So what have you been up to?

219
00:12:56,633 --> 00:12:59,800
What ever happened to the cryptocurrency
you were writing?

220
00:12:59,842 --> 00:13:02,092
It, uh... it's still a pet project.

221
00:13:02,134 --> 00:13:03,425
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

222
00:13:03,467 --> 00:13:05,551
- How's, uh...
- Both: RadCoin.

223
00:13:05,592 --> 00:13:07,716
(chuckles) Yeah, it's going good.

224
00:13:07,758 --> 00:13:08,758
It's been a ride.

225
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,425
You hear we're launching.

226
00:13:10,467 --> 00:13:13,842
Yeah, I saw the animated GIF thing
you guys are advertising with.

227
00:13:13,883 --> 00:13:15,633
- It's super pro, right?
- Mm-hmm.

228
00:13:15,675 --> 00:13:18,342
We launch in 33 days.

229
00:13:18,384 --> 00:13:19,883
Oh, I didn't even tell you this.

230
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:22,466
We have a meeting with Alex Bell

231
00:13:22,467 --> 00:13:23,883
on Tuesday.

232
00:13:23,967 --> 00:13:26,342
Yeah. He's thinking about investing,

233
00:13:26,425 --> 00:13:27,800
gonna come check out our digs.

234
00:13:27,842 --> 00:13:29,675
It's crazy weird, right?

235
00:13:29,758 --> 00:13:31,967
Have Alex Bell at your conference table?

236
00:13:32,008 --> 00:13:32,967
Come on, Izzy.

237
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:34,425
You need to jump on this train.

238
00:13:34,467 --> 00:13:36,758
That's, um... That's... that's kind of

239
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,193
what I wanted to talk to you about.

240
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:39,384
Good.

241
00:13:39,425 --> 00:13:40,384
Wait, are you serious?

242
00:13:40,425 --> 00:13:42,467
Yeah. Well, I mean...

243
00:13:42,509 --> 00:13:45,134
I'd kind of need an
advance on my salary.

244
00:13:45,175 --> 00:13:48,675
I have all these loans that
I need to pay off ASAP.

245
00:13:48,716 --> 00:13:50,008
Okay.

246
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:52,300
- Huh?
- Well, let's talk about it.

247
00:13:52,342 --> 00:13:55,300
Okay. Well, what, um, what
do partners take home?

248
00:13:57,175 --> 00:13:59,967
Um, so...

249
00:14:01,551 --> 00:14:05,133
you know, uh, "partner" might
be kinda, uh, tricky.

250
00:14:05,134 --> 00:14:08,675
But listen, you would be taken care of.

251
00:14:08,758 --> 00:14:11,342
We... pay our engineers very well.

252
00:14:14,134 --> 00:14:15,966
Hey, dude. It's Nick Talman.

253
00:14:15,967 --> 00:14:17,925
Um, I'm good. I'm good.

254
00:14:17,967 --> 00:14:20,966
Thank you. Uh, I'm really
good. How are things in California?

255
00:14:20,967 --> 00:14:23,050
Wonderful investment
opportunity, but, um,

256
00:14:23,092 --> 00:14:25,151
you would have to move very quick
on it. That's the thing.

257
00:14:25,175 --> 00:14:27,800
No, I know.

258
00:14:27,842 --> 00:14:30,384
I... I will. I... no, okay,
wh... okay, let me just say...

259
00:14:31,842 --> 00:14:33,342
JP, it's Nick Talman.

260
00:14:33,384 --> 00:14:35,633
Excellent. I'm so
happy to... let me tell you.

261
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:37,175
So, I have an amazing...

262
00:14:37,217 --> 00:14:39,175
I know, this sounds ridiculous, but...

263
00:14:39,217 --> 00:14:41,133
But... but you don't know that.

264
00:14:41,134 --> 00:14:43,133
(blows raspberry)

265
00:14:43,134 --> 00:14:45,217
Dude, are you still in Nashville?

266
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,925
For me, I just feel like you
have to meet this girl.

267
00:14:47,967 --> 00:14:49,342
So, you're in Japan right now?

268
00:14:49,425 --> 00:14:51,592
You'll thank me if you vet the code.

269
00:14:51,633 --> 00:14:54,299
Thank... I... look, I
appreciate you taking the time, and...

270
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,050
You know what?
Actually, I'm gonna call you back.

271
00:14:57,092 --> 00:14:58,133
No, I got m...

272
00:14:58,134 --> 00:15:00,134
Okay, I gotta go. Call you right back.

273
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:02,716
Hey, Leo.

274
00:15:02,758 --> 00:15:04,092
Nick.

275
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,008
We should talk.

276
00:15:11,551 --> 00:15:13,342
I didn't know what else to do.

277
00:15:13,384 --> 00:15:14,883
I told you I was dealing with it.

278
00:15:14,925 --> 00:15:17,633
Uh-huh. You're in way
over your head, son.

279
00:15:18,883 --> 00:15:20,467
Wanna mix us a couple of drinks?

280
00:15:21,883 --> 00:15:23,050
Okay.

281
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,716
(unzipping)

282
00:17:12,467 --> 00:17:13,467
(splashing)

283
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,300
(grunts)

284
00:17:46,592 --> 00:17:48,312
<i>Leo: I haven't said anything to Benny.</i>

285
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,633
Nick: I appreciate it.

286
00:17:53,134 --> 00:17:54,800
But I'm gonna have to.

287
00:17:54,842 --> 00:17:55,967
Soon.

288
00:17:57,175 --> 00:17:58,842
Otherwise, I can be implicated.

289
00:17:58,883 --> 00:18:00,716
- Really?
- Nick.

290
00:18:00,758 --> 00:18:03,217
Listen very carefully to
what I'm about to say,

291
00:18:03,259 --> 00:18:04,527
'cause I don't think that you have

292
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:05,925
fully grasped this yet.

293
00:18:05,967 --> 00:18:07,050
Are you listening?

294
00:18:07,092 --> 00:18:08,217
Yeah.

295
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,716
You committed multiple felonies.

296
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,342
We got hacked. I mean...

297
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:13,800
But you didn't report it.

298
00:18:15,675 --> 00:18:17,842
And I know why, too.

299
00:18:19,342 --> 00:18:20,675
I know this isn't who you are.

300
00:18:20,758 --> 00:18:22,485
You're a good kid.
You're smart, you're caring,

301
00:18:22,509 --> 00:18:24,467
put people first.

302
00:18:24,509 --> 00:18:25,943
And whether you believe this or not,

303
00:18:25,967 --> 00:18:27,466
I've always liked you.

304
00:18:27,467 --> 00:18:29,758
Breaks my heart that
this is happening now.

305
00:18:31,967 --> 00:18:33,467
Maybe she'll forgive you.

306
00:18:33,509 --> 00:18:36,092
My guess is she probably
will 'cause she understands you.

307
00:18:36,134 --> 00:18:38,551
She wants you to be
happy 'cause she loves you.

308
00:18:38,592 --> 00:18:39,967
And when you love somebody,

309
00:18:40,008 --> 00:18:42,092
that's all that matters.

310
00:18:42,134 --> 00:18:44,175
Not all this.

311
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:48,217
So, here's what's gonna happen next.

312
00:18:48,259 --> 00:18:50,134
I'm gonna pretend that
Taylor never came to me,

313
00:18:50,175 --> 00:18:52,883
I'm gonna pretend we never
had this conversation, you and me,

314
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:54,800
and when I see Benny tomorrow
night for poker,

315
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,342
I'm gonna act like
everything is sunshine and puppy dogs.

316
00:18:57,384 --> 00:19:01,175
But soon, very soon, he's
gonna start wondering

317
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:04,092
what's happening with the
million and a half that he gave ya.

318
00:19:05,925 --> 00:19:08,758
And at that point...

319
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,633
there's nothing I can do to protect you.

320
00:19:29,925 --> 00:19:31,175
Elsie: Dada?

321
00:19:33,342 --> 00:19:34,967
- Hm?
- Guess what?

322
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:36,800
Touie wanted me to tell you something.

323
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,134
Guess what it is?

324

What do you want?

330
00:20:49,092 --> 00:20:50,842
Let's go for a ride.

331
00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:02,175
(loud thumping)

332
00:21:02,217 --> 00:21:03,425
Hm?

(footsteps descending)

334
00:21:23,592 --> 00:21:25,842
I'll be gone before you get home.

335
00:21:29,384 --> 00:21:30,967
Okay. Good.

336

Hey.

340
00:21:59,134 --> 00:22:00,633
Yeah. Sure.

341
00:22:03,633 --> 00:22:05,425
Okay. That's fine.

342
00:22:05,467 --> 00:22:06,716
See you there.

343
00:22:42,967 --> 00:22:43,967
I don't have it yet.

344
00:22:45,509 --> 00:22:46,883
I know, South Beach.

345
00:22:46,925 --> 00:22:48,425
That ain't why we're here.

346
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:50,134
Oh, yeah?

347
00:22:51,592 --> 00:22:53,384
We're here to start a business.

348
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,235
I thought we already tried that.

349
00:22:56,259 --> 00:22:57,716
We tried it the Nick way,

350
00:22:57,758 --> 00:22:59,008
we tried it the Izzy way.

351
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:01,133
Now we're about to
try it the Ronald way.

352
00:23:01,134 --> 00:23:02,633
How much money you got?

353
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,633
How much money do I... uh...

354
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:06,800
do you mean on me?

355
00:23:07,842 --> 00:23:09,134
Total. All in.

356
00:23:09,175 --> 00:23:10,466
What you worth?

357
00:23:10,467 --> 00:23:13,175
Man, nothing. I'm in debt.

358
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:15,799
I've been paying off a student
loan for 10 years.

359
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,299
- Shit!
- I know.

360
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,716
I've been in your spot.
How you pay your rent?

361
00:23:19,758 --> 00:23:21,716
He doesn't. His girl does.

362
00:23:21,758 --> 00:23:23,217
Hey, you know...

363
00:23:25,592 --> 00:23:27,467
Damn, South Beach.

364
00:23:27,509 --> 00:23:28,883
Okay.

365
00:23:28,925 --> 00:23:30,800
Okay, okay. How much you got?

366
00:23:31,842 --> 00:23:33,175
Nothing. I'm broke.

367
00:23:33,217 --> 00:23:34,633
Damn.

368
00:23:34,675 --> 00:23:36,633
You ain't got nothing stashed nowhere?

369
00:23:36,675 --> 00:23:38,342
Not even just a little bit?

370
00:23:38,384 --> 00:23:41,675
I do have a rainy day fund.
I got a small bank account.

371
00:23:41,716 --> 00:23:43,175
- How much in there?
- Uh...

372
00:23:43,217 --> 00:23:46,675
I would have to check,
but I have like $17,000.

373
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:47,840
- 17?
- Yeah.

374
00:23:47,966 --> 00:23:51,152
All right, I got three G's stashed
in the closet. 17 plus three, that's 20.

375
00:23:51,175 --> 00:23:52,675
We got 20 large liquid.

376
00:23:52,758 --> 00:23:53,984
All right, that's gonna be enough.

377
00:23:54,008 --> 00:23:55,758
What are you saying?

378
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,842
I'm saying...

379
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,466
we've been going about this all wrong.

380
00:24:00,467 --> 00:24:02,068
We were trying to
lock down the big busts

381
00:24:02,092 --> 00:24:03,633
before we even got the swagger right.

382
00:24:03,716 --> 00:24:05,050
You dig?

383
00:24:05,092 --> 00:24:07,175
Swa... Okay, I guess. "The swagger"?

384
00:24:09,134 --> 00:24:10,633
Y'all want to start something?

385
00:24:10,675 --> 00:24:13,008
- Yeah.
- We need to stop looking at this shit

386
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:16,008
like it's some West Coast, incubated,
garage-type bullshit.

387
00:24:20,008 --> 00:24:23,092
This here Miami, y'all.

388
00:24:23,134 --> 00:24:26,342
A nigga can have the most revolutionary
idea since the Internet,

389
00:24:26,384 --> 00:24:28,133
and ain't nobody gonna
take you seriously

390
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:30,134
unless you got the swagger.

391
00:24:31,384 --> 00:24:32,633
Okay.

392
00:24:33,925 --> 00:24:35,967
We take our 20 g's,

393
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:38,134
we find us a cheap
space in Wynwood, act like

394
00:24:38,175 --> 00:24:39,966
we going all fucking
hipster or some shit,

395
00:24:39,967 --> 00:24:43,632
hire up a bunch of interns, some smart,

396
00:24:43,633 --> 00:24:45,799
some just to sit there looking fine,

397
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,467
act like we've been at it
for a minute, you feel me?

398
00:24:48,509 --> 00:24:51,467
Act like we already
been out there raising funds

399
00:24:51,509 --> 00:24:55,217
and shit's going real good, you dig?

400
00:24:55,259 --> 00:24:57,342
Make 'em think when
they walk through that door,

401
00:24:57,384 --> 00:24:59,551
they about to be a
part of something new,

402
00:24:59,592 --> 00:25:00,883
something cuttin' edge,

403
00:25:00,925 --> 00:25:03,925
something folks is begging to invest in.

404
00:25:03,967 --> 00:25:05,633
Izzy, you got the code.

405
00:25:05,675 --> 00:25:08,217
Nick, you know about money.
I know about selling.

406
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,509
Three o' us...

407
00:25:10,633 --> 00:25:13,592
we can own this damn city, y'all.

408
00:25:13,633 --> 00:25:15,925
But if we want folks to start
taking us seriously,

409
00:25:15,967 --> 00:25:18,842
we need to act like we already do.

Stupid kids...

412
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,633
never gave me notice.

413
00:25:34,675 --> 00:25:35,967
Never heard from 'em.

414
00:25:39,758 --> 00:25:41,509
Nick: What was their company?

415
00:25:41,551 --> 00:25:43,092
Eh, who the hell knows?

416
00:25:43,134 --> 00:25:46,509
Some dumb, little video game thing
like an app? I don't know.

417
00:25:46,551 --> 00:25:47,883
What do you guys do?

418
00:25:47,967 --> 00:25:50,466
Not thinking about maybe
buying the place, are you?

419
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:51,800
Nick: Uh, no, no.

420
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:53,609
We were thinking of
something much more short-term.

421
00:25:53,633 --> 00:25:54,883
We're thinking about a month.

422
00:25:54,967 --> 00:25:56,259
Just a month?

423
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,633
Yeah, but, you know, if things go well,

424
00:25:58,675 --> 00:26:00,800
we could maybe... we
could maybe work something out.

425
00:26:03,175 --> 00:26:05,551
One month, 10,000 flat.

426
00:26:05,592 --> 00:26:07,259
Nick: We were thinking more like four.

427
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,800
- (scoffs)
- Larry.

428
00:26:09,883 --> 00:26:11,551
Come on, this is free money.

429
00:26:11,592 --> 00:26:13,842
You're not renting this
place out for the month.

430
00:26:13,883 --> 00:26:16,050
All right. Six.

431
00:26:16,092 --> 00:26:18,008
It's gotta be four.

432
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:19,467
Five.

433
00:26:19,509 --> 00:26:21,551
My man here says four.

434
00:26:24,217 --> 00:26:25,967
(scoffs)

435
00:26:26,008 --> 00:26:27,008
All right.

436
00:26:28,217 --> 00:26:29,467
Larry!

437
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,175
Thank you, sir.

438
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,300
Ronald: All right, y'all.

439
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,467
Let's turn this bitch out.

440
00:26:53,134 --> 00:26:54,384
So why GenCoin?

441
00:26:55,592 --> 00:26:57,592
Cryptocurrency is the next thing, right?

442
00:26:57,633 --> 00:26:58,716
Meaning?

443
00:26:58,758 --> 00:27:00,300
If I can go back in time

444
00:27:00,342 --> 00:27:02,300
and try to own a
piece of Internet, you know?

445
00:27:02,342 --> 00:27:03,527
So, you're doing it for the money?

446
00:27:03,551 --> 00:27:06,259
- Aren't you?
- No.

447
00:27:08,716 --> 00:27:11,467
- How computer savvy are you?
- Oh, I'm pretty savvy.

448
00:27:11,509 --> 00:27:12,716
- Really?
- Pretty savvy, yeah.

449
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,716
- Fantastic.
- Yeah.

450
00:27:19,008 --> 00:27:20,734
Uh, what are... do
you have any coding skills?

451
00:27:20,758 --> 00:27:22,425
- "Code"? What?
- Coding.

452
00:27:22,467 --> 00:27:24,134
- "Coding."
- Do you code at all?

453
00:27:29,967 --> 00:27:31,092
(bubbling)

454
00:27:33,134 --> 00:27:34,092
(toilet flushes)

455
00:27:34,134 --> 00:27:35,758
- Your folks rich?
- Sorry?

456
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,716
You come from money?
Do they got money?

457
00:27:37,758 --> 00:27:39,175
- I...
- What's your daddy do?

458
00:27:39,217 --> 00:27:40,675
He's a neurosurgeon.

459
00:27:42,342 --> 00:27:44,050
Give me money.

460
00:27:44,092 --> 00:27:46,092
I thought this was an interview.

461
00:27:46,134 --> 00:27:47,425
(door bangs)

462
00:27:54,633 --> 00:27:57,799
Nick: It's, um, um...

463
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,384
Is it kinda like PayPal?

464
00:27:59,467 --> 00:28:01,966
Um, yes, yes.

465
00:28:01,967 --> 00:28:03,633
Oh boy! I love PayPal!

466
00:28:07,633 --> 00:28:09,300
I've been coding since I was eight.

467
00:28:09,384 --> 00:28:11,966
Built my own rigs and developed
my own software.

468
00:28:11,967 --> 00:28:14,467
- Because you can.
- Right. Because I can.

469
00:28:17,675 --> 00:28:19,092
Can you start tomorrow?

470
00:28:19,134 --> 00:28:21,050
- Yes, ma'am.
- Don't call me that.

471
00:28:29,008 --> 00:28:31,342
Come on, bit-boy, pump it!

472
00:28:31,384 --> 00:28:33,967
That's that feel I like.

473
00:28:34,008 --> 00:28:36,217
It's good. I think it's good.

474
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,633
Ronald: GenCoin. That's what's up.

475
00:28:44,467 --> 00:28:45,984
Nick: A few nibbles,
but nothing concrete.

476
00:28:46,008 --> 00:28:48,259
- No word from Blush yet?
- No.

477
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,800
Sooner or later, he's gonna call,

478
00:28:49,842 --> 00:28:50,967
asking where his money is.

479
00:28:52,092 --> 00:28:53,425
Tell him.

480
00:28:53,467 --> 00:28:55,425
- Say what?
- We lost all his money?

481
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:57,092
No.

482
00:28:57,134 --> 00:28:58,758
This is the point.

483
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,758
We show him his money doing good.

484
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,300
This office.

485
00:29:02,342 --> 00:29:04,675
The youngbloods we got working for us.

486
00:29:04,716 --> 00:29:06,967
If he thinks we're legit, all good.

487
00:29:07,008 --> 00:29:08,384
And then...

488
00:29:09,425 --> 00:29:11,008
we ask him to double down.

489
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:12,092
Nick: No.

490
00:29:12,134 --> 00:29:13,758
- That's...
- That's a brilliant idea.

491
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,068
That's actually a Ponzi scheme.

492
00:29:15,092 --> 00:29:16,300
That's how they do, bro.

493
00:29:16,342 --> 00:29:17,799
Well, that, it might be how it is,

494
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,527
how Bernie Madoff does, but
we're not gonna do that.

495
00:29:19,551 --> 00:29:20,883
That's a brilliant idea.

496
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:22,776
Look, I know you lookin'
to pussyfoot around Blush,

497
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,008
but it could take weeks to
set up more investments.

498
00:29:25,092 --> 00:29:27,259
And here's what's up.

499
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,925
I got a gun to my head, y'all.

500
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,050
The dogs are circling my house,

501
00:29:32,092 --> 00:29:33,467
where my kids at.

502
00:29:33,551 --> 00:29:36,633
And pretty soon, that hammer gonna drop.

503
00:29:36,716 --> 00:29:38,799
And when it do...

504
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,050
if they don't get their 300 from me...

505
00:29:42,342 --> 00:29:44,050
they comin' for you.

506
00:29:45,092 --> 00:29:46,092
And you.

507
00:29:48,509 --> 00:29:50,092
Oh, man.

508
00:29:51,967 --> 00:29:54,633
You know, what you're
proposing is highly, highly illegal.

509
00:29:54,675 --> 00:29:57,300
Nick, you done lost
a million and a half,

510
00:29:57,342 --> 00:29:59,175
and you didn't tell your investor.

511
00:29:59,217 --> 00:30:01,318
You didn't tell your investor
'cause you started this thing

512
00:30:01,342 --> 00:30:03,217
with stolen drug money.

513
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,758
And now... you worried about illegal?

514
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:28,134
(phone rings)

515
00:30:28,175 --> 00:30:30,259
Hi, you've reached Benedict Blush.

516
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,943
Leave me a message,
and I'll get back to you.

517
00:30:31,967 --> 00:30:33,008
(beeps)

518
00:30:34,467 --> 00:30:35,716
(beeps)

519
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,175
- (clatters)
- Fuck.

520
00:31:54,217 --> 00:31:57,633
(sighing)

521
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,467
(phone rings)

522
00:32:19,425 --> 00:32:20,800
(ringing continues)

523
00:32:31,758 --> 00:32:33,217
(phone rings)

524
00:33:49,967 --> 00:33:51,509
(engine starts)

525
00:34:00,925 --> 00:34:03,008
Have a good day, baby girl.

526
00:34:04,467 --> 00:34:05,883
Elsie: Bye, Dad.

527
00:34:10,342 --> 00:34:11,799
Hey, Ronnie. What dey do?

528
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,299
Where you headed?

529
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,300
You need something, bro?

530
00:34:15,342 --> 00:34:18,300
I just comin' through to
see what's good with Touie.

531
00:34:22,134 --> 00:34:24,467
Touie at school, bruh.

532
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:30,883
Fo' sho. Fo' sho.

533
00:34:30,925 --> 00:34:31,925
Fo' sho.

534
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:04,092
Looks legit, huh?

535
00:35:09,716 --> 00:35:12,425
(mimics Ronald) "Some just
to sit there lookin' fine," huh?

536
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,925
(door thuds)

537
00:35:14,967 --> 00:35:16,925
- Woman: Hi.
- Blush: Hi.

538
00:35:16,967 --> 00:35:19,008
I'm Ben Blush,

539
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,633
and I have a 9:00 appointment.

540
00:35:20,675 --> 00:35:21,925
Yes.

541
00:35:21,967 --> 00:35:23,716
Where's Nick?

542
00:35:25,592 --> 00:35:26,842
Woman: That's...

543
00:35:26,883 --> 00:35:28,300
(knock on door)

544
00:35:30,217 --> 00:35:31,342
Damn.

545
00:35:32,384 --> 00:35:33,883
Ain't this some shit.

546
00:35:33,967 --> 00:35:35,633
I can't do this. I'm sorry.

547
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,883
I'm not gonna do this.

548
00:35:40,134 --> 00:35:41,967
It's too late, bruh.

549
00:35:43,134 --> 00:35:44,401
He's sitting at the front right now

550
00:35:44,425 --> 00:35:46,800
staring at that sex doll you hired.

551
00:35:47,925 --> 00:35:49,092
A'ight?

552
00:35:49,134 --> 00:35:50,632
(groans)

553
00:35:50,633 --> 00:35:52,925
What we're doing is fraud.

554
00:35:52,967 --> 00:35:55,842
Nick, my nigga, you in this now.

555
00:35:56,842 --> 00:35:59,134
You been in this.

556
00:36:00,134 --> 00:36:01,758
It can't get no worse.

557
00:36:03,259 --> 00:36:05,217
Is that supposed to
make me feel better?

558
00:36:05,259 --> 00:36:06,467
Yeah.

559
00:36:07,509 --> 00:36:08,842
It is.

560
00:36:08,883 --> 00:36:10,603
All right, now stand
up, man, and be a man.

561
00:36:10,633 --> 00:36:11,842
I need to brush my teeth.

562
00:36:11,883 --> 00:36:13,175
Woman: This is a selfie.

563
00:36:13,217 --> 00:36:15,134
- Yeah.
- And I... (laughs)

564
00:36:15,175 --> 00:36:16,966
Nick: Benny!

565
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:18,384
Good to see you, pal.

566
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:20,050
Hey, Nick. Good to see you.

567
00:36:20,134 --> 00:36:21,800
- Benedict.
- Muah!

568
00:36:21,842 --> 00:36:23,800
- How are you?
- Yeah.

569
00:36:23,842 --> 00:36:25,966
Hey, cool space you picked out here.

570
00:36:25,967 --> 00:36:27,842
You know, very, uh, hipster.

571
00:36:27,925 --> 00:36:29,193
- Mm-hmm.
- That's exactly what it is.

572
00:36:29,217 --> 00:36:30,632
That's exactly what we're going for.

573
00:36:30,633 --> 00:36:32,466
You got that, uh, sort of, uh...

574
00:36:32,467 --> 00:36:34,092
"try to look like I don't care" feel.

575
00:36:34,134 --> 00:36:35,568
Izzy: That's what's cool in the valley.

576
00:36:35,592 --> 00:36:37,467
And, uh, oh, some pretty faces, too.

577
00:36:37,509 --> 00:36:38,716
Nick: Oh, yeah.

578
00:36:38,758 --> 00:36:40,758
I think I know who picked
out that one, yeah?

579
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,509
Nick: I have no...

580
00:36:42,551 --> 00:36:45,050
Believe it or not, Izzy.

581
00:36:45,092 --> 00:36:46,609
- Benny: Oh, yeah?
- Nick: She fought for her.

582
00:36:46,633 --> 00:36:48,467
- Yeah, whatever.
- Blush: Yeah?

583
00:36:50,175 --> 00:36:51,883
Izzy: Yeah.

584
00:36:51,925 --> 00:36:53,842
- So.
- Nick: So...

585
00:36:53,883 --> 00:36:55,883
What did you want to discuss?

586
00:36:55,967 --> 00:36:57,799
Nick: Um, what we've been doing

587
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,133
is inviting some of our big investors

588
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:02,633
to come on down and
take a tour of the offices

589
00:37:02,675 --> 00:37:06,633
and, uh, going over monthly projections.

590
00:37:06,675 --> 00:37:08,758
You wanted to see
if I would double down.

591
00:37:10,967 --> 00:37:14,384
Same thing happens with
every startup I've invested in.

592
00:37:14,425 --> 00:37:17,758
They'll have me come
in and hope that I'll fall

593
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,300
for their dog and
pony, and then in the end,

594
00:37:20,342 --> 00:37:22,259
I'll either be excited enough

595
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,384
or dumb enough to re-up.

596
00:37:25,425 --> 00:37:26,384
Right.

597
00:37:27,551 --> 00:37:31,008
I think it's admirable, your generation.

598
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:33,300
You know, some people
call it "entitlement."

599
00:37:33,342 --> 00:37:35,425
I like to think of it as...

600
00:37:35,467 --> 00:37:37,551
tenacity.

601
00:37:37,633 --> 00:37:39,217
Ronald: You know what, Benny?

602
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,466
We ain't gonna bullshit you no more.

603
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:44,967
That is 100% why Nick called
you in here today.

604
00:37:45,008 --> 00:37:46,300
Mm.

605
00:37:46,342 --> 00:37:50,800
And we did have a whole
dog and whatever lined up.

606
00:37:50,842 --> 00:37:53,632
You know, Izzy was gonna
ride in on a white tiger,

607
00:37:53,633 --> 00:37:55,632
but the Animal Rights Association wanted

608
00:37:55,633 --> 00:37:58,133
a whole ton of cash
to look the other way,

609
00:37:58,134 --> 00:38:00,300
so we scratched that
idea like, you know...

610
00:38:00,384 --> 00:38:02,092
Wait, wait, wait, that doesn't mean that

611
00:38:02,134 --> 00:38:04,509
the fireworks show and the dancing
girls is off, does it?

612
00:38:04,551 --> 00:38:06,068
- No, no, for sure that's on.
- (laughter)

613
00:38:06,092 --> 00:38:07,925
You can't return that.
There are no refunds.

614
00:38:07,967 --> 00:38:10,008
- No refund policy.
- Nick: No, no, no, no, no, no.

615
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:12,592
Hey, but on the real, though,
we just trying to blow

616
00:38:12,633 --> 00:38:14,134
this whole thing out quick.

617
00:38:14,175 --> 00:38:16,193
You know, we want to stay
ahead of the competition.

618
00:38:16,217 --> 00:38:18,384
Izzy: Absolutely. As you are well aware,

619
00:38:18,467 --> 00:38:19,716
RadCoin launches in a month.

620
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,509
- Mm-hmm. Sure.
- And isn't it you that said,

621
00:38:22,551 --> 00:38:27,509
"Doesn't matter who's
best, only matters who's first"?

622
00:38:27,592 --> 00:38:29,758
Yes, it was me who said that.

623
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,675
Nick: Yeah. Also, um...

624
00:38:31,758 --> 00:38:33,742
we've got our whole
marketing PR strategy

625
00:38:33,767 --> 00:38:35,324
ready to go, ready to implement.

626
00:38:35,384 --> 00:38:38,217
We just need to make our second
milestone to pay for it.

627
00:38:38,259 --> 00:38:39,925
So...

628
00:38:39,967 --> 00:38:41,300
who else is on board?

629
00:38:42,509 --> 00:38:43,842
- Um...
- Blush: Investors.

630
00:38:43,883 --> 00:38:45,651
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- I mean, when you guys came to me,

631
00:38:45,675 --> 00:38:47,050
you had nothing.

632
00:38:47,092 --> 00:38:48,883
And now, huh, so quickly.

633
00:38:48,925 --> 00:38:51,527
I mean, you must have roped in a
couple of heavy hitters here, huh?

634
00:38:51,551 --> 00:38:53,092
- All: Mm-hmm.
- Who are they?

635
00:38:53,134 --> 00:38:55,716
- Uh...
- You... You know that

636
00:38:55,758 --> 00:38:57,467
it's not prudent at this juncture

637
00:38:57,509 --> 00:38:59,110
to reveal the names
of the other investors.

638
00:38:59,134 --> 00:39:00,551
- We try to keep that...
- Correct.

639
00:39:00,633 --> 00:39:02,110
Correct. We're keeping it very private.

640
00:39:02,134 --> 00:39:03,509
I think I have a right to know.

641
00:39:03,551 --> 00:39:05,842
I mean, especially since
you're asking me to re-up.

642
00:39:05,883 --> 00:39:08,509
Izzy: Yeah. I mean,
we have a broad overview,

643
00:39:08,592 --> 00:39:10,800
but we don't share investor info here.

644
00:39:10,842 --> 00:39:13,633
We can show you our liquidity,

645
00:39:13,675 --> 00:39:16,092
- our budget, our projections...
- Nick: Yeah, yeah.

646
00:39:16,134 --> 00:39:17,551
I set it all up for you.

647
00:39:17,592 --> 00:39:20,300
I... look, I mean, as far as I know,

648
00:39:20,384 --> 00:39:22,050
you could be bringing me in here

649
00:39:22,092 --> 00:39:24,509
because I am literally the only investor

650
00:39:24,551 --> 00:39:26,425
you have right now.

651
00:39:26,467 --> 00:39:29,425
And it wouldn't be a sound decision

652
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:31,509
to re-up if that were
the case, now would it?

653
00:39:31,551 --> 00:39:32,734
- No.
- Ronald: No, it wouldn't.

654
00:39:32,758 --> 00:39:33,758
You know what, Blush?

655
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,425
I'mma get you some names.

656
00:39:35,467 --> 00:39:37,068
I'mma call up some of
the other investors,

657
00:39:37,092 --> 00:39:38,943
make sure it's cool that we
disclose their names to you.

658
00:39:38,967 --> 00:39:41,633
I'm also gonna need some proof
of funds from your bank.

659
00:39:41,675 --> 00:39:44,008
Mm-hmm. Sure. Why... why is that?

660
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:45,299
Well, I want to make sure that

661
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,300
my money isn't getting lonely, you know?

662
00:39:47,342 --> 00:39:48,966
Fair enough, fair enough.
We can do that.

663
00:39:48,967 --> 00:39:50,299
Maybe give us, uh...

664
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,068
We'll probably get
that for ya end of the week?

665
00:39:52,092 --> 00:39:54,300
No, I'd like it right now.

666
00:39:57,925 --> 00:40:00,716
I don't know if we have it that handy.

667
00:40:00,758 --> 00:40:03,092
Uh, Izzy, can we do that?

668
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:04,799
Yeah, yeah, yeah. The
business manager has it,

669
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,592
but she... she's not here today.

670
00:40:06,633 --> 00:40:08,175
Ah. Well...

671
00:40:09,551 --> 00:40:11,925
I'm sure my lawyers
can sort all this out.

672
00:40:11,967 --> 00:40:13,008
Yeah.

673
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,967
I think I'm gonna have him drop by.

674
00:40:15,008 --> 00:40:16,110
- Nick: Do it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

675
00:40:16,134 --> 00:40:17,883
Ronald: Just have
him... have him stop by

676
00:40:17,925 --> 00:40:19,943
whenever you want, and we'll everything
ready for you, bruh.

677
00:40:19,967 --> 00:40:21,110
Nick: We'll get it prepared.

678
00:40:21,134 --> 00:40:22,633
Hey, Ben, great... Great to see ya.

679
00:40:22,675 --> 00:40:24,008
Hey, Megan, show Blush out.

680
00:40:29,967 --> 00:40:33,134
Okay, all three of us, we're
going to prison for a very long time.

681
00:40:33,175 --> 00:40:34,609
- Shut up.
- We're not going to prison.

682
00:40:34,633 --> 00:40:36,675
We're definitely going
to prison. He knows.

683
00:40:36,758 --> 00:40:39,425
- He doesn't "know" know. He...
- He most definitely knows.

684
00:40:39,467 --> 00:40:41,050
And when he comes with his lawyers,

685
00:40:41,092 --> 00:40:42,259
that's game over.

686
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,568
He wanted to see proof of funds!

687
00:40:43,592 --> 00:40:45,276
Okay, we just have
her fake up some documents.

688
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,633
Oh, my god! Stop!
That's making it worse.

689
00:40:47,675 --> 00:40:49,675
- You got a better idea, Nick?
- No, I don't.

690
00:40:49,716 --> 00:40:51,633
We gotta get him that money.

691
00:40:51,675 --> 00:40:52,842
Jesus.

692
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:54,134
What day is it today?

693
00:40:54,175 --> 00:40:55,217
Ronald: What?

694
00:40:55,259 --> 00:40:57,509
I... it's Tuesday.

695
00:40:57,551 --> 00:40:58,675
Shit!

696
00:40:58,716 --> 00:40:59,758
I have an idea.

697
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,467
- Nick: Is it a good one?
- Izzy: Maybe!

698
00:41:06,175 --> 00:41:07,800
(rock music playing)

699
00:41:08,881 --> 00:41:15,596
