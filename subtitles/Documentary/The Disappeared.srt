1
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,422
(slow, ominous music)

2
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:20,471
(door slams)

3
00:00:38,203 --> 00:00:39,998
[Jake] Are you sure it's
time for him to leave?

4
00:00:40,661 --> 00:00:42,422
[Doctor]
Like I said, I understand your concern.

5
00:00:42,422 --> 00:00:43,757
He has been through a lot.

6
00:00:44,476 --> 00:00:45,917
We've done what we can for him here.

7
00:00:45,917 --> 00:00:46,838
He now needs to get home

8
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:48,615
and get on with the rest of his life,

9
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:51,484
but make sure he keeps up
his outpatient appointments

10
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:53,856
and there'll be regular visits
from the social worker.

11
00:00:55,037 --> 00:00:56,145
Just keep an eye on him.

12
00:00:56,145 --> 00:00:57,441
He'll be fine.

13
00:00:58,157 --> 00:00:59,626
[Jake]
Let's hope you're right.

14
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:02,890
(door clicking open)

15
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:28,113
So what do you fancy
for your tea tonight?

16
00:02:28,113 --> 00:02:30,902
I'll pick it up on the way home.

17
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:33,220
Don't know.

18
00:02:36,048 --> 00:02:38,476
Well, I'll make it special then.

19
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:41,280
Fish chips and mushy peas it is.

20
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:44,371
Okay.

21
00:02:49,411 --> 00:02:51,014
Here are your keys, son.

22
00:03:34,776 --> 00:03:37,147
(heavy beat rap)

23
00:03:41,837 --> 00:03:43,348
(party chatter)

24
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,731
Yeah, I've got a... I've got a light.

25
00:03:44,731 --> 00:03:46,584
I've got a birthday light.

26
00:03:47,318 --> 00:03:48,691
(party chatter)

27
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,001
I'm bored.

28
00:03:50,001 --> 00:03:51,033
Yes, Tommy, come here brother.

29
00:03:51,033 --> 00:03:52,224
Tommy, yes, yes, yes.

30
00:03:52,224 --> 00:03:54,062
Look, look, you've got to stay
here in Dad's bedroom, yeah?

31
00:03:54,062 --> 00:03:54,595
Why?

32
00:03:54,595 --> 00:03:56,208
You've got your chocolate
and your crisps, eh?

33
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:56,875
You've got your stuff.

34
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,958
Don't mention that to Ricky
about the munchies.

35
00:03:59,102 --> 00:04:00,441
But you can't stay in your bedroom,

36
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:02,707
because then daddy will never
let us have a party again.

37
00:04:02,707 --> 00:04:04,781
Fine. I'm going to the playground.

38
00:04:04,781 --> 00:04:05,659
I'll pick you up later.

39
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:06,384
You know what I mean?

40
00:04:06,384 --> 00:04:07,949
I'll pick you up later.

41
00:04:15,312 --> 00:04:17,491
(slow music)

42
00:05:34,022 --> 00:05:35,217
The missing boy.

43
00:05:35,727 --> 00:05:37,762
This is the playground
from which young Tom Ryan

44
00:05:37,762 --> 00:05:40,094
went missing nearly two weeks ago.

45
00:05:40,565 --> 00:05:43,503
So if anybody remembers
anything at all from that night,

46
00:05:43,503 --> 00:05:46,834
no matter how small,
please call the number on your screen.

47
00:05:47,516 --> 00:05:48,446
Police are...

48
00:05:52,008 --> 00:05:55,473
Whoever you are, just please...

49
00:05:56,904 --> 00:05:59,621
I just want Tom back.

50
00:06:01,551 --> 00:06:03,134
Please don't hurt him.

51
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,494
We just want him back home.

52
00:06:08,232 --> 00:06:10,204
Safe... and...

53
00:06:11,808 --> 00:06:14,371
We really need him.

54
00:06:15,168 --> 00:06:17,097
Please don't hurt him,

55
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:19,594
and let us know that he's safe.

56
00:06:27,494 --> 00:06:29,731
(sirens)

57
00:06:35,251 --> 00:06:36,494
[Tom]
Matthew.

58
00:06:36,494 --> 00:06:38,751
The disappearances of children in...

59
00:06:40,603 --> 00:06:42,533
(ominous music)

60
00:06:54,312 --> 00:06:56,674
The police still haven't
found a single clue,

61
00:06:56,674 --> 00:06:59,419
so the nightmare continues
for his father, Jake,

62
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,431
and his brother, Matthew.

63
00:07:00,431 --> 00:07:01,690
[Tom]
Matthew.

64
00:07:15,326 --> 00:07:16,603
(thuds)

65
00:07:18,283 --> 00:07:19,463
Dad?

66
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,328
[Newscaster]
For his father, Jake,

67
00:07:38,328 --> 00:07:39,220
and his brother, Matthew.

68
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,305
[Tom]
Matthew.

69
00:07:43,982 --> 00:07:45,336
(groans)

70
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,340
(silverware jingles)

71
00:08:08,438 --> 00:08:09,677
Thanks, son.

72
00:08:30,768 --> 00:08:32,141
Dad, I was...

73
00:08:33,244 --> 00:08:35,846
I was listening
to those tapes of Tom's...

74
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:42,989
I heard something.

75
00:08:47,452 --> 00:08:48,922
Let me show you.

76
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,743
[Jake]
Please don't hurt him.

77
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,642
We just want him back home.

78
00:08:57,494 --> 00:08:58,675
Safe.

79
00:08:58,795 --> 00:09:03,163
And we really need him.

80
00:09:03,859 --> 00:09:06,797
Please don't hurt him,

81
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:08,535
and let us know that he's safe.

82
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,859
The police still haven't
found a single clue.

83
00:09:12,859 --> 00:09:15,441
(report continues under
louder ominous music)

84
00:09:15,548 --> 00:09:17,304
(glass shattering)

85
00:09:17,904 --> 00:09:20,842
Police are refusing
to comment on similarities

86
00:09:20,842 --> 00:09:22,070
between this case

87
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,174
and other disappearances
(knocking)

88
00:09:23,174 --> 00:09:25,085
of children in the area.

89
00:09:27,955 --> 00:09:29,549
Hi, I was just passing by.

90
00:09:29,549 --> 00:09:31,556
I had a home visit in the block.

91
00:09:31,987 --> 00:09:33,494
How is everything?

92
00:09:33,754 --> 00:09:34,517
What happened to your hand?

93
00:09:34,517 --> 00:09:36,754
Uh, no, just an accident.

94
00:09:38,184 --> 00:09:40,041
Everything all right with you, Matthew?

95
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,511
Yeah, I'm all right.

96
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:44,035
Well, welcome back.

97
00:09:44,035 --> 00:09:45,830
If you need to talk, just drop by.

98
00:09:47,722 --> 00:09:49,420
Good night, Mr. Ballan.

99
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:53,971
(heavy breathing)

100
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,508
Of course, I understand it, doctor.

101
00:10:16,508 --> 00:10:17,352
He's my son.

102
00:10:17,352 --> 00:10:18,696
I just don't think I can handle it

103
00:10:18,696 --> 00:10:19,771
if he tips over again.

104
00:10:19,771 --> 00:10:21,451
Remember what happened the last time.

105
00:10:24,014 --> 00:10:26,559
All right, okay,
we'll just wait and see then.

106
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,136
It's always the easiest bloody thing.

107
00:10:29,136 --> 00:10:30,431
(phone slams)

108
00:10:34,492 --> 00:10:36,192
(trash rustling)

109
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:42,182
(slow music)

110
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:52,527
(crow squawks)

111
00:11:08,486 --> 00:11:10,204
For fuck's sake.

112
00:11:16,396 --> 00:11:18,134
Please don't hurt him.

113
00:11:18,393 --> 00:11:20,669
We just want him back home.

114
00:11:22,771 --> 00:11:24,125
Safe.

115
00:11:26,246 --> 00:11:30,364
And we really need him.

116
00:11:31,704 --> 00:11:33,586
Please don't hurt him.

117
00:11:34,075 --> 00:11:36,005
(thuds and distant cries)

118
00:12:21,403 --> 00:12:22,296
Hi.

119
00:12:23,054 --> 00:12:24,926
You must've moved in when I was away.

120
00:12:26,241 --> 00:12:27,192
Hi.

121
00:12:27,273 --> 00:12:28,920
I'm Matt, by the way.

122
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,118
Hi, I'm Amy.

123
00:12:32,049 --> 00:12:33,268
Hi, Amy.

124
00:12:36,619 --> 00:12:38,069
Listen,

125
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,352
are you all right?

126
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,923
These... the walls, man, they're thin.

127
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,117
I wasn't listening in, but...

128
00:12:47,117 --> 00:12:49,391
I know. I can hear TV.

129
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:56,246
Listen, I'm really sorry
about you brother.

130
00:12:59,962 --> 00:13:01,527
(sighs)

131
00:13:02,265 --> 00:13:05,251
(slow, sad music)

132
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:38,313
(ominous music building)

133
00:14:13,556 --> 00:14:14,870
Amy!

134
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:20,246
Amy!

135
00:14:42,528 --> 00:14:43,882
(lighter clicks)

136
00:14:45,514 --> 00:14:46,886
Still got it, then?

137
00:14:49,719 --> 00:14:50,976
Yeah, man.

138
00:14:53,385 --> 00:14:54,682
I met this girl.

139
00:14:55,517 --> 00:14:56,986
Jesus Christ, that was quick.

140
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,046
She fit.

141
00:14:58,046 --> 00:14:59,284
It's not like that.

142
00:15:00,043 --> 00:15:01,300
You fucking loser.

143
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,594
What about you anyway?

144
00:15:04,594 --> 00:15:06,216
What's going on?

145
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,328
I ain't got no time for a hoe, bro.

146
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:10,324
Cousin got me a job down in a car yard.

147
00:15:10,795 --> 00:15:12,057
Money's crap, but I love it.

148
00:15:12,057 --> 00:15:14,179
I've even started to fix up me
a Merly down there.

149
00:15:14,495 --> 00:15:15,701
Have you passed your test then?

150
00:15:15,701 --> 00:15:18,244
Not exactly. Yeah, not like that.

151
00:15:20,232 --> 00:15:21,912
Put in a good word for you
if you want, man.

152
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,524
That's cool, man.

153
00:15:26,486 --> 00:15:28,320
I'm a bit undecided, you know.

154
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:30,533
They're trying to push me
into some college course

155
00:15:30,533 --> 00:15:31,819
or something, or if it's not that,

156
00:15:31,819 --> 00:15:34,363
it's get a job, and I'm like...

157
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:37,166
I just... I need some time, you know.

158
00:15:37,272 --> 00:15:38,822
Yeah, give it a fortnight.

159
00:15:38,822 --> 00:15:40,733
Bloody mad, bein' in that flat all day.

160
00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:52,272
I know, man.

161
00:15:52,886 --> 00:15:54,201
I'll give it some thought.

162
00:16:03,177 --> 00:16:04,570
You're right, though, yeah.

163
00:16:06,749 --> 00:16:08,313
How's it going with your old man?

164
00:16:08,318 --> 00:16:09,519
Fucked, mate.

165
00:16:09,816 --> 00:16:11,707
He thinks I've lost my mind again.

166
00:16:12,101 --> 00:16:13,147
Why's that?

167
00:16:14,404 --> 00:16:16,651
I was looking at some of the old

168
00:16:16,651 --> 00:16:18,946
news reports of Tom's disappearance.

169
00:16:19,627 --> 00:16:20,428
That from the night?

170
00:16:20,428 --> 00:16:23,683
And I thought that I heard
his voice on one of the tapes.

171
00:16:26,227 --> 00:16:29,174
And I told him, and that was a mistake.

172
00:16:32,006 --> 00:16:33,591
Some spooky shit, man.

173
00:16:34,272 --> 00:16:35,626
What was he saying?

174
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:39,235
Just calling. Just calling to me.

175
00:16:42,374 --> 00:16:43,671
I've seen sort of this.

176
00:16:43,671 --> 00:16:45,144
You know, used to brag
about it the other day.

177
00:16:45,144 --> 00:16:46,853
Some sort of phenomenon where you get

178
00:16:46,853 --> 00:16:49,723
dead people's voices on tapes.

179
00:16:50,117 --> 00:16:51,514
People go around
recording them and that.

180
00:16:51,514 --> 00:16:53,155
I see it, I see it on TV, man.

181
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,457
We don't know that's Tom dead, do we?

182
00:16:57,984 --> 00:16:59,107
So...

183
00:17:07,008 --> 00:17:08,870
Look, Matt, while you were away, man,

184
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,214
there was some shit
wrote about your family,

185
00:17:10,214 --> 00:17:12,029
about that poor Saks.

186
00:17:12,053 --> 00:17:12,913
What?

187
00:17:12,913 --> 00:17:15,802
Nothing, man, just dragging up
the past and all that.

188
00:17:15,845 --> 00:17:17,121
What that?

189
00:17:18,149 --> 00:17:21,451
Some shit about your dad
breaking your brother's arm

190
00:17:21,451 --> 00:17:23,803
in a fit of rage,
or something like that.

191
00:17:28,478 --> 00:17:29,755
I had to tell you, man.

192
00:17:37,925 --> 00:17:40,891
(ominous music)

193
00:18:21,557 --> 00:18:23,986
Testing, testing, one, two, three...

194
00:18:25,877 --> 00:18:27,557
I don't know why I'm doing this, mate.

195
00:18:34,949 --> 00:18:36,427
Someone said to do it.

196
00:18:36,878 --> 00:18:38,270
(laughs)

197
00:18:39,009 --> 00:18:40,939
Someone fucking said...

198
00:18:43,157 --> 00:18:44,540
So I'm fucking sat here,

199
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,949
in the middle of
a fucking playground, yeah,

200
00:18:50,414 --> 00:18:54,110
talking to you on a fucking recorder.

201
00:18:57,288 --> 00:18:59,409
Is this where you went from?

202
00:18:59,918 --> 00:19:01,339
If you're out there.

203
00:19:01,339 --> 00:19:02,597
(laughs)

204
00:19:05,256 --> 00:19:07,800
You know, fucking say, dude.

205
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:09,711
Let's just know, yeah.

206
00:19:09,711 --> 00:19:11,851
Let's not this in between.

207
00:19:12,455 --> 00:19:14,174
You shouldn't have gone.

208
00:19:14,645 --> 00:19:16,094
That wasn't fair.

209
00:19:19,444 --> 00:19:21,355
What is it happened, eh?

210
00:19:23,631 --> 00:19:27,845
It's quiet and quiet and quiet in there.

211
00:19:30,427 --> 00:19:31,473
Freak.

212
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:35,380
You've been in our playground
talking to yourself.

213
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,974
What are you fucking doing
in our playground, you prick.

214
00:19:36,974 --> 00:19:38,520
First sign of madness.

215
00:19:42,543 --> 00:19:44,414
[Voiceover]
Wait! Wait, where you going?

216
00:19:45,557 --> 00:19:47,064
Hold this fucking thing, huh?

217
00:19:48,149 --> 00:19:49,013
What are you listening to?

218
00:19:49,013 --> 00:19:50,385
Some fucking girl band?

219
00:19:52,315 --> 00:19:53,866
You're that kid whose brother
went missing, yeah?

220
00:19:53,866 --> 00:19:55,420
I saw you on TV the other day.

221
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,899
Your dad was fucking
crying and everything.

222
00:19:56,899 --> 00:19:58,377
Everybody says your dad did it.

223
00:19:58,377 --> 00:19:59,683
Your mom went missing as well, did she?

224
00:19:59,683 --> 00:20:01,003
I'd be fucking worried if I was you.

225
00:20:01,003 --> 00:20:02,097
(thud)

226
00:20:02,097 --> 00:20:03,489
(cries and thuds)

227
00:20:08,318 --> 00:20:09,902
(laughing)

228
00:20:15,845 --> 00:20:17,083
Matt?

229
00:20:20,856 --> 00:20:22,267
(groans)

230
00:20:24,696 --> 00:20:26,049
Matt?

231
00:20:28,517 --> 00:20:30,101
Matt, you all right?

232
00:20:30,436 --> 00:20:31,810
Hello.

233
00:20:39,653 --> 00:20:41,217
(groans)

234
00:20:53,189 --> 00:20:54,479
(water running)

235
00:20:54,479 --> 00:20:55,300
So take it down, yeah.

236
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,643
Like, there's one thing I know about.

237
00:20:57,643 --> 00:20:59,535
It's cleaning up cuts and bruises.

238
00:21:03,479 --> 00:21:04,834
Do you miss your mum?

239
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,805
Not really, she left so long ago,

240
00:21:12,407 --> 00:21:14,241
I don't think about her
that much, you know.

241
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,312
Tom was so young.

242
00:21:19,435 --> 00:21:21,000
He never even knew her.

243
00:21:24,427 --> 00:21:26,049
They're the freaks.

244
00:21:27,288 --> 00:21:28,767
Beating you up after everything

245
00:21:28,767 --> 00:21:30,600
that your family has been through.

246
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,557
Family.

247
00:21:34,699 --> 00:21:37,435
Yeah, it's not much of family, really.

248
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,254
Dad hates me.

249
00:21:42,494 --> 00:21:45,249
He blames me for what happened to Tom.

250
00:21:47,486 --> 00:21:48,859
Dad was out.

251
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,230
We were having a party,

252
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:53,794
and Tom wanted to go to the playground.

253
00:21:56,452 --> 00:21:58,104
And it was my birthday, so you know,

254
00:21:58,104 --> 00:22:00,187
I'm drinking and I'm smoking and...

255
00:22:05,054 --> 00:22:08,520
And by the time I come to collect him,

256
00:22:09,509 --> 00:22:10,805
he was gone.

257
00:22:22,872 --> 00:22:24,417
He'll be home soon.

258
00:22:28,248 --> 00:22:30,158
What's with your dad, Amy?

259
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:36,072
Okay, listen, thanks. Yeah.

260
00:22:38,155 --> 00:22:39,624
I'll track you there.

261
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,843
(door slams)

262
00:22:51,115 --> 00:22:52,814
How'd your appointment go today?

263
00:22:53,861 --> 00:22:54,965
Fine.

264
00:22:56,568 --> 00:22:57,581
Been taking the pills?

265
00:22:57,581 --> 00:22:58,589
Yeah.

266
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:03,043
Matthew.

267
00:23:04,377 --> 00:23:06,115
What happened to your face?

268
00:23:07,527 --> 00:23:08,784
Fell over.

269
00:23:14,592 --> 00:23:16,099
(door slams)

270
00:23:19,085 --> 00:23:20,256
[Matthew]
Let's just know.

271
00:23:20,256 --> 00:23:21,974
Let's not just this in between.

272
00:23:26,495 --> 00:23:27,677
You shouldn't have gone.

273
00:23:28,819 --> 00:23:30,134
It wasn't fair.

274
00:23:31,008 --> 00:23:33,129
[Tom] Help me, Matthew.
It's dark in here.

275
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,856
I'm really scared.

276
00:23:36,672 --> 00:23:38,409
What's that you're listening to?

277
00:23:39,533 --> 00:23:40,791
Nothing.

278
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:45,302
Are you sure you're all right?

279
00:23:53,501 --> 00:23:55,065
(door slams)

280
00:24:10,368 --> 00:24:12,682
(crying)

281
00:24:27,379 --> 00:24:29,808
(gagging)

282
00:24:54,412 --> 00:24:55,536
I was just on my way out, actually.

283
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:57,235
Matthew, you know how
important our meetings are.

284
00:24:57,235 --> 00:24:58,532
No one said you were coming.

285
00:24:59,117 --> 00:25:01,257
I just have to check that
you're settling back all right.

286
00:25:02,573 --> 00:25:03,619
Fuckin' A.

287
00:25:03,739 --> 00:25:06,321
As your care worker,
I just have to tick a few boxes.

288
00:25:08,284 --> 00:25:10,157
Why did you miss
your outpatient appointment?

289
00:25:10,877 --> 00:25:12,019
I was sick.

290
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,631
Try not to miss the next one.

291
00:25:15,677 --> 00:25:17,404
So how's it been,
coming back to this state,

292
00:25:17,404 --> 00:25:18,797
living with your father?

293
00:25:19,133 --> 00:25:20,332
All right.

294
00:25:20,918 --> 00:25:22,580
Really? What happened to your face?

295
00:25:22,915 --> 00:25:24,288
Had an accident.

296
00:25:25,353 --> 00:25:26,918
So how've you been?

297
00:25:28,214 --> 00:25:29,664
I'm all right, I said.

298
00:25:34,358 --> 00:25:36,470
Look, Matthew, this is going
to sound really boring,

299
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:38,332
but it's important that you don't miss

300
00:25:38,332 --> 00:25:39,648
your hospital appointments.

301
00:25:42,576 --> 00:25:45,033
You thought anymore about
the courses I told you about?

302
00:25:45,033 --> 00:25:46,512
I run a few of them
down at the church hall.

303
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:48,288
It's not too late to come along.

304
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:52,666
(continues talking under ominous music)

305
00:25:59,126 --> 00:26:00,691
What's the matter, Matthew?

306
00:26:11,107 --> 00:26:12,576
Nothing.

307
00:26:14,827 --> 00:26:16,576
Hear the words of comfort.

308
00:26:16,576 --> 00:26:19,963
Our Saviour, Christ, says
to all who truly turn to him.

309
00:26:20,433 --> 00:26:23,583
Come to me, all who labor
and our heavy-laden,

310
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:25,454
and I will give you rest.

311
00:26:26,693 --> 00:26:28,420
God so loved the world,

312
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,206
that he gave his only son,

313
00:26:30,206 --> 00:26:31,934
that whoever believes in him,

314
00:26:31,934 --> 00:26:33,086
should not perish,

315
00:26:33,086 --> 00:26:34,958
but have eternal life,

316
00:26:35,198 --> 00:26:38,404
and when our mortal flesh is laid aside,

317
00:26:38,404 --> 00:26:42,869
an everlasting dwelling place
is made for us in heaven.

318
00:26:47,179 --> 00:26:49,300
It'd be good to see Matthew
at the next meeting.

319
00:26:49,444 --> 00:26:50,741
How's your hand, by the way?

320
00:26:51,019 --> 00:26:52,219
It's better.

321
00:26:52,786 --> 00:26:53,452
When is the next meeting?

322
00:26:53,452 --> 00:26:54,922
Tuesday.

323
00:27:11,904 --> 00:27:12,509
Simon.

324
00:27:12,509 --> 00:27:13,671
Yes, Matthew.

325
00:27:13,853 --> 00:27:14,679
You got a ciggy?

326
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:15,543
Yeah, man.

327
00:27:15,543 --> 00:27:16,618
How was the God squad?

328
00:27:16,618 --> 00:27:18,374
Great.

329
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:19,968
Good.

330
00:27:21,321 --> 00:27:22,463
Hey, Matt.

331
00:27:22,627 --> 00:27:23,923
How you doing?

332
00:27:24,605 --> 00:27:25,444
Sophie.

333
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:27,278
I've not seen you for ages.

334
00:27:28,094 --> 00:27:29,179
How's the looney bin?

335
00:27:29,179 --> 00:27:30,475
Oy.

336
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:31,800
Lay off.

337
00:27:34,171 --> 00:27:35,851
I said go. I'll see you at home.

338
00:27:38,645 --> 00:27:40,094
Think she fancies you, bro.

339
00:27:41,217 --> 00:27:42,225
Shut up.

340
00:27:42,965 --> 00:27:44,361
She's your sister, mate.

341
00:27:44,361 --> 00:27:45,388
That's too disgusting.

342
00:27:45,388 --> 00:27:46,666
She's twelve years old.

343
00:27:50,746 --> 00:27:53,021
Hey, you know what you were
talking about with the tape?

344
00:27:53,722 --> 00:27:55,267
Recording things, and...

345
00:27:55,642 --> 00:27:56,679
Yeah.

346
00:27:56,679 --> 00:27:58,415
I've done it, and...

347
00:27:58,618 --> 00:28:00,105
Can I play it to you?

348
00:28:00,864 --> 00:28:02,102
Yeah, man.

349
00:28:02,419 --> 00:28:03,677
Want some speed?

350
00:28:04,204 --> 00:28:05,193
All right.

351
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,501
I'm talking to you

352
00:28:11,501 --> 00:28:13,065
on a fucking recorder.

353
00:28:15,821 --> 00:28:18,134
This is where you went from.

354
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,270
If you're out there.
(laughs)

355
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,912
Watch the space here, it's coming up.

356
00:28:22,286 --> 00:28:23,717
You're fucking losing it.

357
00:28:23,717 --> 00:28:25,819
It's fucking on here. I did it.

358
00:28:26,414 --> 00:28:27,643
Well, you're fucking joking.

359
00:28:27,643 --> 00:28:28,930
Nobody's going to take you
seriously, man.

360
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:29,727
It was your idea.

361
00:28:29,727 --> 00:28:30,941
You said it, and I did it,
and it worked.

362
00:28:30,941 --> 00:28:32,016
Matt, man.
(laughs)

363
00:28:32,016 --> 00:28:32,789
It's on here.

364
00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:34,123
I mean, you hear voices, bro.

365
00:28:34,439 --> 00:28:36,149
You need to spend a bit longer
in the old whack shack,

366
00:28:36,149 --> 00:28:37,329
you know what I mean?

367
00:28:38,837 --> 00:28:40,324
We'll see what happens, eh?

368
00:28:43,022 --> 00:28:44,376
What the fuck, man?

369
00:28:52,795 --> 00:28:55,089
(slow, sad music)

370
00:29:03,979 --> 00:29:05,083
Tom!

371
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,992
Mom! Mom!

372
00:29:28,699 --> 00:29:30,033
(door slams)

373
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:48,562
(knocking)

374
00:30:03,316 --> 00:30:04,613
What's wrong?

375
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,954
What is it?

376
00:30:09,096 --> 00:30:11,583
Seriously, you haven't said
a word since I got here.

377
00:30:19,791 --> 00:30:21,528
I think he's still alive.

378
00:30:22,709 --> 00:30:24,158
I heard his voice.

379
00:30:25,013 --> 00:30:26,366
No one else has,

380
00:30:26,568 --> 00:30:28,363
but something's going on.

381
00:30:30,869 --> 00:30:32,971
It's something between me and him.

382
00:30:36,706 --> 00:30:38,270
Like, I believe you.

383
00:30:42,177 --> 00:30:43,387
You know what?

384
00:30:43,387 --> 00:30:45,144
I might have something for you.

385
00:30:52,853 --> 00:30:54,850
No one seems to know
that much about her.

386
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:57,364
She seem to sort of freak everyone out.

387
00:30:57,364 --> 00:30:59,198
They call her a witch.
(laughs)

388
00:30:59,669 --> 00:31:02,452
I've seen her, just like
wandering around the corridors

389
00:31:02,452 --> 00:31:03,562
a few times.

390
00:31:03,562 --> 00:31:06,701
Seems like she's just misunderstood.

391
00:31:08,323 --> 00:31:09,993
I know where she lives.

392
00:31:10,415 --> 00:31:12,355
It's on the Pie Hawk State,
just around the corner.

393
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:15,663
Thanks.

394
00:31:15,663 --> 00:31:18,398
You've got nothing to lose
by paying her a visit.

395
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:22,468
Thanks, Amy.

396
00:31:22,767 --> 00:31:23,909
For what?

397
00:31:24,878 --> 00:31:27,538
For not thinking that I'm some

398
00:31:28,565 --> 00:31:30,398
fuckin' (sighs).

399
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:32,971
(laughs)
I never said you weren't.

400
00:31:36,783 --> 00:31:41,399
You know, there is help
that you can get, too.

401
00:31:52,329 --> 00:31:53,414
Sorry.

402
00:31:56,611 --> 00:31:58,867
I just wanted to say thanks.

403
00:32:00,682 --> 00:32:02,284
You already did.

404
00:32:05,808 --> 00:32:07,181
I'd better get back.

405
00:32:07,181 --> 00:32:08,495
Yeah.

406
00:32:18,605 --> 00:32:19,152
Knob.

407
00:32:19,152 --> 00:32:20,467
(sighs)

408
00:32:58,838 --> 00:33:00,479
[Tom]
Where were you, Matthew?

409
00:33:04,344 --> 00:33:06,101
You never came for me, Matthew.

410
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:07,925
I waited for you.

411
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:10,786
Matthew.

412
00:33:11,294 --> 00:33:12,398
Matthew.

413
00:33:14,452 --> 00:33:15,283
(thuds)

414
00:33:15,283 --> 00:33:16,483
Matthew!

415
00:33:21,168 --> 00:33:22,387
(thuds)

416
00:33:24,854 --> 00:33:26,727
(ominous sound effects)

417
00:33:31,037 --> 00:33:32,736
You can't help. You can't help me.

418
00:33:32,995 --> 00:33:34,810
[Tom]
You never came for me, Matthew.

419
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,209
I waited for you.

420
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,588
Where were you?

421
00:33:44,995 --> 00:33:46,752
Where were you, Matthew?

422
00:33:48,307 --> 00:33:49,930
(banging)

423
00:33:54,864 --> 00:33:56,217
[Tom]
Matthew.

424
00:33:57,417 --> 00:33:59,693
(ominous sound effects)

425
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:25,396
(phone ringing)

426
00:34:31,061 --> 00:34:32,683
Is this your friend?

427
00:34:35,995 --> 00:34:37,867
Just ignore her, Matthew.

428
00:34:38,832 --> 00:34:40,608
She gets a bit ahead of herself.

429
00:34:41,827 --> 00:34:43,527
How'd you know my name?

430
00:34:43,824 --> 00:34:45,062
Shall we begin?

431
00:34:50,966 --> 00:34:52,109
Yeah.

432
00:34:58,743 --> 00:35:00,576
You know, all I need to know,

433
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,783
sort of why he won't...
why he won't leave me alone.

434
00:35:03,783 --> 00:35:05,751
Why can't I get rid of him?

435
00:35:05,755 --> 00:35:07,752
Sounds obvious,
but maybe he's trying to say

436
00:35:07,752 --> 00:35:09,163
something to you.

437
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,982
So you think he's dead then?

438
00:35:15,701 --> 00:35:17,399
I can't answer that, but

439
00:35:19,003 --> 00:35:22,065
maybe he's trying to
warn you about something.

440
00:35:33,307 --> 00:35:34,527
You all right?

441
00:35:36,783 --> 00:35:39,000
(footsteps)

442
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:43,752
Remember he's just a child.

443
00:35:43,752 --> 00:35:45,115
Maybe he's just angry with you

444
00:35:45,115 --> 00:35:47,352
because you weren't there
for him when he needed you.

445
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,925
Ghosts are about the unresolved.

446
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:52,439
They never rest
until they find an answer.

447
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:54,014
Ghosts?

448
00:35:54,407 --> 00:35:56,414
Matthew, this place is full of them.

449
00:35:58,133 --> 00:36:00,005
It's a ghost area.

450
00:36:02,933 --> 00:36:04,411
Don't worry, sweetie.

451
00:36:04,411 --> 00:36:05,976
Mommy's just telling a story.

452
00:36:09,826 --> 00:36:11,409
Try not to worry too much.

453
00:36:11,631 --> 00:36:13,425
I'm sure you'll find what you need.

454
00:36:15,451 --> 00:36:16,671
Yeah.

455
00:36:22,017 --> 00:36:23,717
Listen, thanks very much.

456
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:26,640
How much do I owe you?

457
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,109
There's no need.

458
00:36:28,267 --> 00:36:29,160
You sure?

459
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,273
It's fine.

460
00:36:34,181 --> 00:36:35,227
Thanks.

461
00:36:35,755 --> 00:36:37,224
This is for you.

462
00:36:38,578 --> 00:36:39,586
For me?

463
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:44,674
Thank you very much.

464
00:36:52,358 --> 00:36:53,467
(door slams)

465
00:36:53,467 --> 00:36:54,455
Hello?

466
00:36:56,251 --> 00:36:57,259
Dad?

467
00:37:04,041 --> 00:37:05,299
Dad?

468
00:37:07,075 --> 00:37:09,484
(ominous music)

469
00:37:28,714 --> 00:37:30,316
Dad, where were you?

470
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:32,698
What is it, Matthew?

471
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:35,751
I was just saying goodnight.

472
00:37:44,419 --> 00:37:45,888
You all right, Dad?

473
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,802
All right, night, then.

474
00:37:52,017 --> 00:37:53,179
Shut the door?

475
00:38:08,722 --> 00:38:10,344
(door slams)

476
00:38:18,436 --> 00:38:21,653
(slow, gentle music)

477
00:39:00,407 --> 00:39:01,666
(knocking)

478
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,348
Saks.

479
00:39:07,348 --> 00:39:09,316
Hello, Matthew, I need
to ask you some questions.

480
00:39:11,476 --> 00:39:13,714
What do you think about
the latest abductions?

481
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:14,894
Do you believe rumors that

482
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,324
it may be the work of a serial killer?

483
00:39:16,949 --> 00:39:18,110
What abduction?

484
00:39:18,946 --> 00:39:21,374
Sophie Pryor.

485
00:39:21,479 --> 00:39:23,698
I believe you may be a friend
of her brother's, Simon.

486
00:39:28,714 --> 00:39:29,554
You got to go now.

487
00:39:29,554 --> 00:39:30,350
Matt.

488
00:39:31,281 --> 00:39:33,557
Do you think it was a local person
that killed them?

489
00:39:34,315 --> 00:39:35,688
Fuck off.

490
00:39:36,158 --> 00:39:37,858
You're all the same really.

491
00:39:37,944 --> 00:39:39,240
(door slams)

492
00:39:50,414 --> 00:39:51,787
(bell ringing)

493
00:39:58,901 --> 00:40:00,369
Saks was here earlier.

494
00:40:01,589 --> 00:40:03,538
Made mum and dad cry with his questions.

495
00:40:11,419 --> 00:40:13,022
Maybe you think it's Sophie?

496
00:40:14,107 --> 00:40:15,086
Where'd you get it?

497
00:40:15,086 --> 00:40:16,978
It led on from the stuff with the tape.

498
00:40:17,659 --> 00:40:18,557
What happened there?

499
00:40:18,557 --> 00:40:20,294
I met up with this woman, Simon.

500
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,061
She wanted to help.

501
00:40:22,685 --> 00:40:25,171
She's a... she's a medium.

502
00:40:26,564 --> 00:40:29,035
She's not some sort
of crystal gazer, man.

503
00:40:29,035 --> 00:40:31,762
She's good, and her daughter drew that

504
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:33,038
for me.

505
00:40:33,484 --> 00:40:34,541
A medium?

506
00:40:34,541 --> 00:40:35,938
She lives on the Whitehawk Estate.

507
00:40:35,938 --> 00:40:37,118
Shelley Cartwright.

508
00:40:38,049 --> 00:40:39,249
Shelley Cartwright.

509
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,725
Fucking hell, man.

510
00:40:42,792 --> 00:40:43,497
What's wrong with you?

511
00:40:43,497 --> 00:40:45,388
She died years ago,
and her flat burnt down.

512
00:40:45,667 --> 00:40:46,589
Her daughter was in it.

513
00:40:46,589 --> 00:40:47,549
It was all over the news.

514
00:40:47,549 --> 00:40:49,368
No, you're thinking
of someone else, mate.

515
00:40:49,368 --> 00:40:51,624
I spoke with her, and she...

516
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,254
Sort your head out, bro.

517
00:40:54,591 --> 00:40:56,423
Do you think we need
this shit right now?

518
00:40:56,568 --> 00:40:58,603
Simon, you've got the wrong person.

519
00:40:58,603 --> 00:40:59,813
I think she can help, you know.

520
00:40:59,813 --> 00:41:03,720
I think... when I heard about
Sophie and saw that drawing.

521
00:41:04,478 --> 00:41:06,273
I can't believe you, man.

522
00:41:09,663 --> 00:41:12,398
Don't just fucking stand there
looking at me, you psycho.

523
00:41:12,711 --> 00:41:14,851
Fuck off! Go! Get out!

524
00:41:15,225 --> 00:41:16,272
Get out!

525
00:41:17,971 --> 00:41:19,556
Tom, he's trying to warn us.

526
00:42:37,444 --> 00:42:40,968
(cries)

527
00:42:48,489 --> 00:42:49,862
(door slams)

528
00:43:05,232 --> 00:43:06,509
Hello?

529
00:43:13,699 --> 00:43:15,792
(driving drum rhythms)

530
00:43:16,675 --> 00:43:18,778
(ominous singing)

531
00:44:31,671 --> 00:44:32,011
Watch out.

532
00:44:32,011 --> 00:44:33,057
You watch out.

533
00:44:33,163 --> 00:44:34,190
Matt, what's wrong?

534
00:44:34,699 --> 00:44:35,803
Fuck off.

535
00:44:36,062 --> 00:44:37,013
What?

536
00:44:37,272 --> 00:44:38,568
The fucking medium.

537
00:44:39,057 --> 00:44:39,950
What happened?

538
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:41,669
She doesn't exist, Amy. She's dead.

539
00:44:43,195 --> 00:44:44,818
You think that this is a joke?

540
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:46,363
You think that this is funny?

541
00:44:46,363 --> 00:44:48,619
You think that this is fucking funny.

542
00:44:50,241 --> 00:44:51,653
I thought you were different.

543
00:44:51,682 --> 00:44:52,642
I thought you understood,

544
00:44:52,642 --> 00:44:54,149
but you're just like everybody else.

545
00:44:55,463 --> 00:44:58,065
I didn't know (cries).

546
00:45:03,336 --> 00:45:04,478
Wait.

547
00:45:06,292 --> 00:45:07,473
Wait.

548
00:45:15,259 --> 00:45:17,592
But it was so real.

549
00:45:20,616 --> 00:45:22,257
But then not there.

550
00:45:24,398 --> 00:45:26,251
I'm sorry, Amy, you all right?

551
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:27,557
Yeah.

552
00:45:29,549 --> 00:45:30,538
Yeah.

553
00:45:35,423 --> 00:45:38,640
So what do you think
she was trying to tell you?

554
00:45:38,957 --> 00:45:41,078
That Tom was trying
to tell me something.

555
00:45:41,933 --> 00:45:43,420
But she's not fucking there.

556
00:45:45,484 --> 00:45:46,666
You know, so...

557
00:45:53,645 --> 00:45:56,198
If you think your brother
is trying to tell you something,

558
00:45:56,198 --> 00:45:59,414
then it doesn't matter
if it's real or not.

559
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,615
You just listen to it.

560
00:46:00,615 --> 00:46:01,968
It doesn't matter.

561
00:46:03,629 --> 00:46:07,459
You just listen. Okay?

562
00:46:17,145 --> 00:46:18,407
I know you're a good man, the family,

563
00:46:18,407 --> 00:46:20,962
they're all looking forward
to seeing you again, so...

564
00:46:20,962 --> 00:46:22,910
Just try and enjoy it, okay?

565
00:46:30,019 --> 00:46:31,661
(doorbell rings)

566
00:46:32,727 --> 00:46:34,522
Your dad's been coming around
whilst you been away.

567
00:46:34,877 --> 00:46:36,211
He keeps blaming himself.

568
00:46:37,219 --> 00:46:38,688
It's no one's fault,

569
00:46:39,524 --> 00:46:41,452
but he really feels guilty.

570
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,527
Maybe he should.

571
00:46:44,016 --> 00:46:45,407
He was at work, too.

572
00:46:46,781 --> 00:46:49,017
You know he left early
to get back to you guys.

573
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,861
What?

574
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,184
It doesn't really matter now,
does it, Matt?

575
00:46:54,691 --> 00:46:56,467
You both really need to help each other.

576
00:47:00,201 --> 00:47:01,882
Just look after yourself.

577
00:47:04,272 --> 00:47:06,893
(ominous music)

578
00:47:48,201 --> 00:47:49,444
(knocking)

579
00:47:49,444 --> 00:47:50,607
Come in.

580
00:47:50,746 --> 00:47:52,791
No, no. That's far too many pills.

581
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:58,992
No, look, you've only
been out for four weeks.

582
00:48:01,747 --> 00:48:03,187
It's four pills a day.

583
00:48:03,187 --> 00:48:04,320
If you want to change anything,

584
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,153
then you have to come and see me.

585
00:48:07,046 --> 00:48:08,112
Yes.

586
00:48:08,966 --> 00:48:10,647
Look, I'm here til six.

587
00:48:13,305 --> 00:48:13,934
What is this?

588
00:48:13,934 --> 00:48:15,057
Fine.

589
00:48:16,065 --> 00:48:18,514
Just, well, look. Come in,
and bring your father.

590
00:48:21,125 --> 00:48:22,181
Will you?

591
00:48:22,891 --> 00:48:23,803
Fine.

592
00:48:25,147 --> 00:48:28,017
Good, thanks, yeah. Okay.

593
00:48:28,411 --> 00:48:29,304
Bye.

594
00:48:30,773 --> 00:48:31,858
Right.

595
00:48:33,019 --> 00:48:34,238
How are things with you?

596
00:48:44,443 --> 00:48:46,949
(scratching)

597
00:49:03,605 --> 00:49:05,284
(knocking)

598
00:49:09,883 --> 00:49:11,064
Hello.

599
00:49:16,123 --> 00:49:17,323
Excuse me.

600
00:49:19,714 --> 00:49:20,928
Excuse me, is it all right...

601
00:49:20,928 --> 00:49:21,984
Could I come in?

602
00:49:24,393 --> 00:49:25,728
Yeah?

603
00:49:30,749 --> 00:49:32,544
I um... I've got this...

604
00:49:33,783 --> 00:49:36,254
I was in Dr. Cull's office.

605
00:49:36,254 --> 00:49:40,449
I saw this, which I've seen before.

606
00:49:41,323 --> 00:49:43,061
What do you know about this?

607
00:49:47,304 --> 00:49:47,822
(mumbles)

608
00:49:47,822 --> 00:49:48,811
[Matthew] What?

609
00:49:50,165 --> 00:49:51,120
Save them.

610
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,570
What is? This is?

611
00:49:54,595 --> 00:49:56,679
It's happening to you, too.

612
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,137
What are you doing in here?

613
00:49:58,781 --> 00:50:00,000
Do you know Edward?

614
00:50:00,278 --> 00:50:01,656
(mumbles) Before it pulls you under.

615
00:50:01,656 --> 00:50:03,129
No, yeah, no.

616
00:50:03,129 --> 00:50:04,425
I'll show you out.

617
00:50:04,838 --> 00:50:06,950
Come on, please.
You're disturbing the patient.

618
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:07,901
Yeah.

619
00:50:14,746 --> 00:50:15,725
No, it was my fault.

620
00:50:15,725 --> 00:50:16,800
It was my fault completely.

621
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,682
I went in there. I started, um...

622
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:20,438
Started asking him stuff, it was stupid.

623
00:50:21,312 --> 00:50:23,376
What happened to him?

624
00:50:23,655 --> 00:50:25,449
[Nurse] He's been in here for years.

625
00:50:27,264 --> 00:50:29,193
He was with a classmate went missing.

626
00:50:29,433 --> 00:50:30,754
[Matthew] Why'd he kill him?

627
00:50:30,754 --> 00:50:32,693
[Nurse] A lot of people
thought he did, but...

628
00:50:32,693 --> 00:50:34,930
They never found a body, so....

629
00:50:37,013 --> 00:50:37,915
This is you.

630
00:50:37,915 --> 00:50:39,931
Just follow this corridor
right to the exit.

631
00:50:39,931 --> 00:50:40,978
Okay?

632
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:46,065
(ominous music)

633
00:51:28,623 --> 00:51:30,244
(distant screams)

634
00:51:37,204 --> 00:51:39,595
(groans)

635
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:44,395
(distant arguing)

636
00:51:58,420 --> 00:51:59,990
[Voiceover]
Where's your mommy now, boy?

637
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:01,709
Where's your fucking mommy now, huh?

638
00:52:02,447 --> 00:52:03,211
(cries)

639
00:52:03,211 --> 00:52:04,930
Come on, you little fucking pussy.

640
00:52:05,457 --> 00:52:08,462
Fuck with us?
Get out of my fucking face.

641
00:52:09,067 --> 00:52:11,169
Get the fuck out my face.

642
00:52:11,352 --> 00:52:12,888
You don't know who you're
fucking with, boy.

643
00:52:12,888 --> 00:52:14,885
Little pussy, yo. You little pussy, yo.

644
00:52:14,885 --> 00:52:16,517
(glass shattering)

645
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:20,049
Hey, take that way.

646
00:52:21,364 --> 00:52:22,344
Come with me.

647
00:52:22,344 --> 00:52:23,755
Wait.

648
00:52:41,544 --> 00:52:44,011
(panting)

649
00:52:49,281 --> 00:52:50,481
Hey!

650
00:53:06,946 --> 00:53:08,530
He's around here somewhere.

651
00:53:15,355 --> 00:53:16,709
(whistles)

652
00:53:19,618 --> 00:53:21,278
Really? Look who it is.

653
00:53:28,161 --> 00:53:30,379
You boys, back off, now.

654
00:53:32,866 --> 00:53:34,468
Matthew, come here.

655
00:53:42,465 --> 00:53:44,184
Wrong time, boys.

656
00:53:53,409 --> 00:53:55,954
I'm sorry I couldn't put
any brandy in this.

657
00:53:57,364 --> 00:53:58,430
You okay?

658
00:54:01,262 --> 00:54:03,009
I know I told you to drop by, Matthew,

659
00:54:03,009 --> 00:54:04,536
but it's a bit late, isn't it?

660
00:54:05,621 --> 00:54:06,615
Sorry, Mr. Ballan.

661
00:54:06,615 --> 00:54:07,719
No, it's all right.

662
00:54:08,093 --> 00:54:10,233
I was here getting ready
for tomorrow anyway.

663
00:54:11,568 --> 00:54:12,979
You call me Adrian.

664
00:54:13,661 --> 00:54:14,851
Why you out so late?

665
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:16,300
Won't your dad be worried about you?

666
00:54:19,613 --> 00:54:21,993
They've probably gone by now,
so I should probably...

667
00:54:21,993 --> 00:54:22,896
They're a nasty bunch.

668
00:54:22,896 --> 00:54:24,883
Looks to me like they're
out for blood tonight.

669
00:54:26,659 --> 00:54:28,791
You're not in any kind
of trouble, are you?

670
00:54:28,791 --> 00:54:30,240
No, nothing like that.

671
00:54:32,342 --> 00:54:33,898
So, how is your father?

672
00:54:33,898 --> 00:54:35,462
More importantly, how are you?

673
00:54:37,776 --> 00:54:38,995
I'm okay.

674
00:54:41,193 --> 00:54:43,027
Thank you for asking.

675
00:54:43,478 --> 00:54:45,427
Look, Matthew, will you
just cut the bullshit.

676
00:54:46,358 --> 00:54:47,588
You might think
I'm just here to do a job,

677
00:54:47,588 --> 00:54:49,439
but I do the job because I want to help.

678
00:54:49,930 --> 00:54:52,133
I can't begin to imagine
how difficult this must be for you.

679
00:54:52,133 --> 00:54:53,803
It's hard to make sense of it all,

680
00:54:53,803 --> 00:54:56,001
but there are ways
of working through it.

681
00:54:57,029 --> 00:54:59,189
Do you think that I had
anything to do with Tom?

682
00:55:00,407 --> 00:55:01,666
I don't know,

683
00:55:03,115 --> 00:55:05,736
but I do know that anything's
possible these days.

684
00:55:08,049 --> 00:55:11,775
When people have lost their beliefs

685
00:55:11,775 --> 00:55:13,166
and their faith,

686
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,487
what/s left?

687
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:20,789
I should leave them to the police.

688
00:55:31,013 --> 00:55:33,000
(distant screams)

689
00:55:35,064 --> 00:55:37,685
You believe in an afterlife?

690
00:55:40,094 --> 00:55:41,602
Don't you?

691
00:55:46,776 --> 00:55:49,473
I really am sorry about
your brother, Matthew.

692
00:55:51,691 --> 00:55:55,137
Do you think we'll ever find him?

693
00:55:57,586 --> 00:55:59,419
Know what happened to him?

694
00:56:01,872 --> 00:56:03,168
(clock chimes)

695
00:56:03,658 --> 00:56:05,798
Fuck. Sorry, sorry.

696
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:10,041
I should be going.

697
00:56:10,723 --> 00:56:12,230
Thank you for the tea.

698
00:56:15,158 --> 00:56:16,300
All right.

699
00:56:19,478 --> 00:56:21,658
Take care of yourself,
Matthew, all right?

700
00:56:29,021 --> 00:56:31,123
Always (groans).

701
00:56:32,284 --> 00:56:33,484
You have.

702
00:56:34,435 --> 00:56:35,846
He would have.

703
00:56:41,117 --> 00:56:42,393
Matt.

704
00:56:42,615 --> 00:56:44,217
(muttering and crying out)

705
00:56:44,217 --> 00:56:45,398
Shush now, come on.

706
00:56:46,772 --> 00:56:48,624
Matthew, you're having a bad dream.

707
00:56:49,037 --> 00:56:50,275
Matt.

708
00:56:50,842 --> 00:56:51,854
(child crying)

709
00:56:51,854 --> 00:56:53,073
Matt.

710
00:56:53,717 --> 00:56:55,070
(screams)

711
00:56:56,712 --> 00:56:57,701
Matt.

712
00:56:57,998 --> 00:56:59,045
Get off me.

713
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:00,610
Get off me, get off me.

714
00:57:00,610 --> 00:57:01,430
Get the fuck off me.

715
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:02,208
(thud)

716
00:57:32,304 --> 00:57:33,427
(thud)

717
00:57:34,204 --> 00:57:35,674
(distant child laughing)

718
00:57:47,347 --> 00:57:49,334
(dripping)

719
00:58:38,554 --> 00:58:40,675
(wheels rolling)

720
00:59:07,910 --> 00:59:09,974
(ominous music)

721
00:59:37,171 --> 00:59:38,179
(door slams)

722
00:59:41,568 --> 00:59:42,845
(sighs)

723
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:46,934
Why do you have Tom's watch?

724
01:00:01,267 --> 01:00:04,982
Police gave it to me,
when they'd finished with it.

725
01:00:06,029 --> 01:00:07,575
They found it in the playground.

726
01:00:12,806 --> 01:00:14,246
You'd already gone into the hospital,

727
01:00:14,246 --> 01:00:16,003
and I didn't think
you should know about it.

728
01:00:18,259 --> 01:00:19,853
I still don't think you're able to...

729
01:00:19,853 --> 01:00:20,957
You're lying.

730
01:00:21,581 --> 01:00:22,492
What?

731
01:00:23,001 --> 01:00:25,065
You left your party early that night.

732
01:00:26,976 --> 01:00:28,656
So where were you?

733
01:00:29,588 --> 01:00:31,065
For Christ's sake, Matthew.

734
01:00:31,065 --> 01:00:32,784
I left with a girl from work.

735
01:00:34,599 --> 01:00:36,672
The real question is,

736
01:00:36,672 --> 01:00:38,966
where the fuck were you?

737
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:41,318
You were meant to be looking after him.

738
01:00:41,318 --> 01:00:43,709
I told you to look after him,

739
01:00:44,294 --> 01:00:45,600
but instead you were getting pissed

740
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,722
and God knows what else
with your friends.

741
01:00:55,584 --> 01:00:56,842
Son.

742
01:00:58,252 --> 01:01:00,086
I think you need some more help.

743
01:01:00,634 --> 01:01:02,236
That would suit you, wouldn't it?

744
01:01:02,688 --> 01:01:03,605
That would suit you, wouldn't it?

745
01:01:03,605 --> 01:01:04,671
Locking me up again?

746
01:01:05,736 --> 01:01:06,629
No.

747
01:01:08,885 --> 01:01:10,372
Because you did it.

748
01:01:10,632 --> 01:01:11,775
I know you did it.

749
01:01:23,495 --> 01:01:24,850
[Amy] Don't do it.

750
01:01:24,850 --> 01:01:26,107
It's not worth it.

751
01:01:28,997 --> 01:01:30,446
I heard all the shouting.

752
01:01:35,698 --> 01:01:37,089
You're not okay.

753
01:01:39,173 --> 01:01:40,391
Come with me.

754
01:01:40,651 --> 01:01:42,158
I want to show you something.

755
01:01:59,947 --> 01:02:01,339
This is just...

756
01:02:01,637 --> 01:02:03,192
Where I like to come,

757
01:02:03,192 --> 01:02:05,621
just when everything gets too much.

758
01:02:07,358 --> 01:02:08,299
Pretend one of them is mine,

759
01:02:08,299 --> 01:02:10,747
and I can just sail away.

760
01:02:13,291 --> 01:02:14,626
Which one do you like?

761
01:02:20,299 --> 01:02:21,345
What you doing?

762
01:02:21,470 --> 01:02:22,944
Come on, there you go. Get in.

763
01:02:22,944 --> 01:02:24,009
Don't be stupid.

764
01:02:24,134 --> 01:02:25,161
Come on.

765
01:02:29,683 --> 01:02:31,267
(laughing)

766
01:02:37,228 --> 01:02:38,947
He had a good job,

767
01:02:39,667 --> 01:02:43,286
and we lived in a nice house,

768
01:02:44,698 --> 01:02:46,224
in a nice neighborhood.

769
01:02:50,112 --> 01:02:51,504
I used to play piano.

770
01:02:53,751 --> 01:02:55,719
He got redundant.

771
01:02:57,533 --> 01:03:02,131
And he started to drink.

772
01:03:04,810 --> 01:03:06,336
And...

773
01:03:10,070 --> 01:03:11,597
Everything changed.

774
01:03:15,081 --> 01:03:17,549
We ended up here.

775
01:03:19,747 --> 01:03:22,348
(slow, sad music)

776
01:03:24,835 --> 01:03:26,688
And that's my story.

777
01:03:28,406 --> 01:03:29,990
Give or take a few bruises.

778
01:03:38,544 --> 01:03:41,222
Try not to think the worst of your dad.

779
01:03:43,439 --> 01:03:44,909
You have to trust him.

780
01:03:45,898 --> 01:03:47,423
It's on both of you.

781
01:03:56,784 --> 01:03:57,926
So.

782
01:04:01,219 --> 01:04:02,592
Where are we going?

783
01:04:03,792 --> 01:04:06,595
Well, I do rather
like the south of France

784
01:04:06,595 --> 01:04:08,064
this time of year.

785
01:04:10,627 --> 01:04:13,209
So why don't you lie back,

786
01:04:13,484 --> 01:04:16,353
and I'll have us back by the morning.

787
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:22,324
You're the captain.

788
01:05:01,444 --> 01:05:02,588
Dad.

789
01:05:04,671 --> 01:05:05,870
Dad.

790
01:05:07,473 --> 01:05:10,401
Dad, I didn't mean what I said,

791
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:12,572
but I'm sorry about everything.

792
01:05:12,572 --> 01:05:13,353
I'm sorry.

793
01:05:13,353 --> 01:05:14,155
Don't worry.

794
01:05:14,155 --> 01:05:14,981
I'm sorry.

795
01:05:14,981 --> 01:05:15,778
Don't worry.

796
01:05:27,845 --> 01:05:29,102
I'm sorry, son.

797
01:05:33,548 --> 01:05:34,503
It's for your own, good.

798
01:05:34,503 --> 01:05:35,818
Okay, I'll take it from here.

799
01:06:18,931 --> 01:06:20,189
(cell phone ringing)

800
01:06:20,602 --> 01:06:21,514
Hello?

801
01:06:21,696 --> 01:06:23,299
Okay. There's no one here.

802
01:06:25,171 --> 01:06:26,352
Coming back.

803
01:06:47,136 --> 01:06:49,661
(humming)

804
01:07:12,974 --> 01:07:14,270
(crying)

805
01:07:14,270 --> 01:07:16,334
Is that Took? What's happened?

806
01:07:16,334 --> 01:07:17,659
What's the matter, darling?

807
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:18,811
Tell me.

808
01:07:19,243 --> 01:07:20,356
All right, shh, shh.

809
01:07:20,356 --> 01:07:21,240
What's the matter?

810
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:22,137
Tell me.

811
01:07:22,137 --> 01:07:23,607
Sweetie, what happened?

812
01:07:24,192 --> 01:07:25,570
It's okay. It's okay.

813
01:07:25,570 --> 01:07:26,770
Oh my god.

814
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:28,632
What's happened to us?

815
01:07:28,853 --> 01:07:30,110
Shh, shh, shh.

816
01:07:31,291 --> 01:07:32,530
It's not your day.

817
01:07:33,038 --> 01:07:34,478
Something's happened to Rebecca.

818
01:07:34,478 --> 01:07:35,832
We need some help.

819
01:07:36,455 --> 01:07:38,462
(screaming)

820
01:07:43,137 --> 01:07:44,645
Get out of my house.

821
01:07:44,751 --> 01:07:46,613
Get out of my house, you evil bastard.

822
01:07:46,613 --> 01:07:47,592
Get out.

823
01:07:47,592 --> 01:07:48,639
(screams)

824
01:07:48,993 --> 01:07:50,366
Oh, Rebecca, Rebecca.

825
01:07:50,433 --> 01:07:51,979
It's all right, hold on.

826
01:08:03,768 --> 01:08:05,564
No! Leave us alone.

827
01:08:07,099 --> 01:08:09,489
Please, leave.

828
01:08:11,323 --> 01:08:14,030
Shh, shh. It's okay, sweet baby.

829
01:08:14,030 --> 01:08:15,941
It's okay. Shh, shh.

830
01:08:20,174 --> 01:08:21,552
Rebecca, under the bed.

831
01:08:21,552 --> 01:08:22,661
Quickly, quickly.

832
01:08:22,661 --> 01:08:23,899
Under the bed.

833
01:08:26,827 --> 01:08:27,993
It's okay.

834
01:08:27,993 --> 01:08:29,462
(crying)

835
01:08:31,623 --> 01:08:32,727
Shh, shh.

836
01:08:37,747 --> 01:08:39,619
(screaming)

837
01:09:06,548 --> 01:09:08,457
Anything's possible these days,

838
01:09:10,041 --> 01:09:12,835
when people who've lost their beliefs,

839
01:09:14,995 --> 01:09:16,310
and their faith.

840
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:18,941
(ominous music)

841
01:09:34,233 --> 01:09:35,741
Oy. Oy, Matt.

842
01:09:36,941 --> 01:09:38,241
Matthew, oy!

843
01:09:38,241 --> 01:09:39,730
Wait, Matt.

844
01:09:40,142 --> 01:09:40,829
What's going on, man?

845
01:09:40,829 --> 01:09:41,803
Have you done a few things?

846
01:09:41,803 --> 01:09:42,739
Where were you?

847
01:09:42,739 --> 01:09:43,958
I know who did it, Simon.

848
01:09:43,963 --> 01:09:44,981
It was Mr. Ballan.

849
01:09:44,981 --> 01:09:46,181
He's using the church.

850
01:09:46,224 --> 01:09:46,680
Ballan, why...

851
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:48,091
You won't believe me, so I don't care.

852
01:09:48,312 --> 01:09:49,061
I don't care.

853
01:09:49,061 --> 01:09:49,843
It's Mr. Ballan.

854
01:09:49,843 --> 01:09:50,832
Matt!

855
01:10:02,765 --> 01:10:05,462
(ominous music)

856
01:10:40,954 --> 01:10:42,422
Dearly beloved,

857
01:10:42,883 --> 01:10:45,946
we have prayed that
our lord, Jesus Christ,

858
01:10:46,934 --> 01:10:48,192
will receive her,

859
01:10:48,701 --> 01:10:50,246
give her eternal life,

860
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:52,858
and the Kingdom of Heaven.

861
01:10:53,655 --> 01:10:56,025
Would the godparents
please step forward?

862
01:11:07,613 --> 01:11:09,907
(baby crying)

863
01:11:22,454 --> 01:11:23,789
(banging)

864
01:11:27,926 --> 01:11:29,952
(ominous music and church bells tolling)

865
01:11:43,771 --> 01:11:45,013
(door slams)

866
01:12:37,779 --> 01:12:39,224
(door clanging)

867
01:12:39,906 --> 01:12:40,890
Fuck.

868
01:14:11,111 --> 01:14:13,012
(ominous music)

869
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:13,184
(child crying)

870
01:15:45,488 --> 01:15:47,726
(child crying)

871
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:50,029
It's okay.

872
01:15:50,903 --> 01:15:51,969
It's okay.

873
01:15:52,151 --> 01:15:53,235
It's all right.

874
01:15:54,839 --> 01:15:55,790
It's okay.

875
01:15:58,199 --> 01:16:01,588
Sophie, it's me. It's Matthew.

876
01:16:02,232 --> 01:16:05,236
It's okay. Don't be afraid, okay?

877
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:08,001
I'm here to help you.

878
01:16:08,017 --> 01:16:09,485
(grunts)

879
01:16:14,910 --> 01:16:16,513
What have you done?

880
01:16:18,327 --> 01:16:20,295
Forty fucking guns in my brother.

881
01:16:20,881 --> 01:16:23,118
What happened to my little brother?

882
01:16:24,279 --> 01:16:27,265
(gagging)

883
01:16:31,285 --> 01:16:33,176
Hello? Anybody down there?

884
01:16:37,526 --> 01:16:38,687
Hello?

885
01:16:40,405 --> 01:16:41,798
I can't see anyone.

886
01:16:42,152 --> 01:16:43,486
I think I see light.

887
01:16:44,898 --> 01:16:47,865
Simon, Jake. What are you doing here?

888
01:16:48,450 --> 01:16:49,948
Matthew's run off.

889
01:16:49,948 --> 01:16:50,990
For some reason,
Simon thought he might've come

890
01:16:50,990 --> 01:16:51,994
to the church.

891
01:16:51,994 --> 01:16:52,954
I'm sorry, Jake.

892
01:16:52,954 --> 01:16:54,875
I haven't seen him,
but I'll call the office,

893
01:16:54,875 --> 01:16:56,728
let them know what's happened,
see if they can help.

894
01:16:56,967 --> 01:16:59,213
If you do see him, I'd be grateful

895
01:16:59,213 --> 01:17:00,750
if you could give us a call then,

896
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:02,214
and if you see him,

897
01:17:02,214 --> 01:17:04,087
don't take any notice of what he says.

898
01:17:05,805 --> 01:17:07,446
What happened to your door?

899
01:17:07,898 --> 01:17:10,250
Vandals, we get a lot
of them around here.

900
01:17:12,122 --> 01:17:14,061
I'm sorry, gents, I must get on,

901
01:17:14,061 --> 01:17:15,674
but I'll be sure to call you, Jake,

902
01:17:15,674 --> 01:17:17,469
if I see Matthew, all right?

903
01:17:24,333 --> 01:17:25,908
Matt looked so convinced.

904
01:17:25,908 --> 01:17:28,413
I told you. That's how
he gets when he's ill.

905
01:17:30,208 --> 01:17:31,840
Look, I'd better get back to the flat,

906
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:33,098
in case he turns up.

907
01:17:34,855 --> 01:17:36,227
I'm sure he will.

908
01:17:36,832 --> 01:17:37,913
See you later.

909
01:17:37,913 --> 01:17:39,536
All right. Thanks, son.

910
01:17:43,059 --> 01:17:44,912
(distant scream)

911
01:18:15,711 --> 01:18:17,755
(dramatic music)

912
01:18:19,063 --> 01:18:21,741
Don't kill me! Don't kill me!

913
01:18:32,889 --> 01:18:34,799
(cracking)

914
01:18:50,946 --> 01:18:54,296
(crying and screaming)

915
01:18:59,922 --> 01:19:00,783
Go. Go Sophie.

916
01:19:00,783 --> 01:19:01,944
Go Sophie, run!

917
01:19:02,151 --> 01:19:03,136
Run Sophie!

918
01:19:03,136 --> 01:19:04,413
(grunting)

919
01:19:23,738 --> 01:19:26,358
(digging and scraping)

920
01:19:32,751 --> 01:19:33,990
Matthew.

921
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:37,042
Matthew, wake up.

922
01:19:39,221 --> 01:19:40,940
Wake up now, Matthew, please.

923
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:43,052
Come on.

924
01:19:43,523 --> 01:19:44,761
Wake up now.

925
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:47,929
Wake up Matthew.

926
01:19:48,745 --> 01:19:50,617
You have to come out of there.

927
01:19:51,683 --> 01:19:53,381
(gasping)

928
01:20:01,033 --> 01:20:03,135
(retching)

929
01:20:19,542 --> 01:20:22,950
(crying)

930
01:20:37,455 --> 01:20:38,732
Simon.

931
01:20:52,691 --> 01:20:54,678
(crying)

932
01:21:25,263 --> 01:21:27,501
(ominous sound effects)

933
01:22:01,715 --> 01:22:02,943
(scream)

934
01:22:09,577 --> 01:22:11,641
(gasping)

935
01:22:26,958 --> 01:22:29,002
He called your name in the end.

936
01:22:30,394 --> 01:22:31,844
(thud)

937
01:22:40,416 --> 01:22:43,902
(thudding)

938
01:22:53,050 --> 01:22:55,710
(ominous music)

939
01:23:56,622 --> 01:23:57,860
Thank you.

940
01:24:12,025 --> 01:24:13,359
Where's Amy?

941
01:24:14,915 --> 01:24:16,604
Amy? You mean Sophie.

942
01:24:17,439 --> 01:24:18,736
She's fine.

943
01:24:19,782 --> 01:24:21,918
They found her just after she escaped.

944
01:24:21,918 --> 01:24:24,135
She's safe now.

945
01:24:26,622 --> 01:24:27,860
Simon.

946
01:24:42,606 --> 01:24:44,651
Did you catch him? Did you get him?

947
01:24:46,282 --> 01:24:48,058
No. He escaped.

948
01:24:48,951 --> 01:24:50,132
I killed him.

949
01:24:50,852 --> 01:24:53,588
No, son. The police
are searching for him now.

950
01:24:55,306 --> 01:24:56,967
They don't even know who he is.

951
01:24:57,803 --> 01:24:59,732
They found the real Ballan in there.

952
01:25:00,549 --> 01:25:02,017
He'd been dead for years.

953
01:25:09,313 --> 01:25:11,847
Son, I have to tell you.

954
01:25:13,493 --> 01:25:16,498
They found Tommy in there
with the others.

955
01:25:27,010 --> 01:25:29,400
(crying)

956
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:39,145
What about Amy? Where's Amy?

957
01:25:39,145 --> 01:25:41,276
I don't know who Amy is, son,

958
01:25:41,276 --> 01:25:44,453
but you should... you should
get some rest now.

959
01:25:45,078 --> 01:25:48,563
We'll talk some more later, okay.

960
01:26:32,828 --> 01:26:35,468
(sad, sentimental music)

961
01:27:49,916 --> 01:27:51,461
I'll wait there, son.

962
01:27:54,044 --> 01:27:55,416
I'll be a minute.

963
01:28:47,804 --> 01:28:51,173
(ominous music)
