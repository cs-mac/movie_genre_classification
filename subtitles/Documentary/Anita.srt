00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:52,706
Who is it?

1
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,844
Hello sir. My name is Biharilal.

2
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:01,281
What is it? I have heard
a lot about you.

3
00:01:01,586 --> 00:01:03,986
I have come to give
you a little trouble.

4
00:01:04,055 --> 00:01:04,612
This astrological letter

5
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,059
Hari Om. Hari Om. Hari Om.

6
00:01:22,006 --> 00:01:23,837
Nothing. Nothing.

7
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:25,873
Tell me something priest.

8
00:01:26,444 --> 00:01:27,877
She is my only daughter.

00:01:32,183 --> 00:01:32,740
Will you be able to year?

10
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,019
Yes.

11
00:01:35,186 --> 00:01:36,915
This is not astrological letter
of an ordinary girl.

12
00:01:37,088 --> 00:01:38,919
She is an extra ordinary girl.

13
00:01:41,192 --> 00:01:41,920
She was born on the
day of an eclipse.

14
00:01:42,093 --> 00:01:44,186
Yes.

15
00:01:44,495 --> 00:01:47,157
She is twenty one years old.
- Yes.

16
00:01:48,132 --> 00:01:49,963
It is very difficult.

17
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:51,967
Her name is Anita.

18
00:01:52,136 --> 00:01:53,967
Yes priest.

19
00:01:54,172 --> 00:01:56,003
Anita.

20
00:02:02,313 --> 00:02:09,048
On a very fair moon like face.

21
00:02:11,355 --> 00:02:16,088
There are black eyes.

22
00:02:19,363 --> 00:02:22,093
Neeraj is come. Where
are you Neeraj?

23
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,099
In your heart.

24
00:02:25,303 --> 00:02:28,795
Don it be silly. Daddy
will hear it.

25
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:31,200
Daddy is not at home.

26
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:32,004
And the servants?

27
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,679
I have given them the Diwali
bonus and sent them.

28
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,041
You have become very smart.

29
00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:44,317
What have I learnt in this love?

30
00:02:44,755 --> 00:02:45,050
What have I gained?

31
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:47,220
I know all that.

32
00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:49,223
But, where are you?

33
00:02:49,827 --> 00:02:52,227
I have told you. In your heart.

34
00:02:55,399 --> 00:02:57,264
You have rested a
lot in my heart.

35
00:02:58,836 --> 00:03:01,805
Now come in front
of my eyes mister.

36
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,370
How can I come in
front of such eyes?

37
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:14,975
On a very fair moon like face.

38
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:27,598
On a very fair moon like face.

39
00:03:33,271 --> 00:03:39,107
You will lose your sleep
by looking at them.

40
00:03:44,649 --> 00:03:47,482
Fair, very fair.

41
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:05,533
What is the use of putting
the sari on your face?

42
00:04:06,137 --> 00:04:11,575
What is the use of putting
the sari on your face?

43
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:16,612
This cloud has got a current.

44
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,612
Stay away.

45
00:04:21,752 --> 00:04:23,617
Stay away.

46
00:04:24,922 --> 00:04:26,651
Stay away.

47
00:04:28,626 --> 00:04:34,656
And killing eyes.

48
00:04:36,267 --> 00:04:41,967
On a very fair moon like face.

49
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:50,745
Fair, very fair.

50
00:05:17,508 --> 00:05:23,777
Except her everything
is darkness.

51
00:05:25,082 --> 00:05:30,918
Except her everything
is darkness.

52
00:05:31,088 --> 00:05:35,923
There is such a special
thing in her.

53
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,961
Eyes.

54
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,964
Eyes.

55
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:46,228
Eyes.

56
00:05:46,537 --> 00:05:47,868
Every thing is similar.

57
00:05:49,273 --> 00:05:53,004
But her eyes are special.

58
00:05:55,179 --> 00:06:00,708
On a very fair moon like face.

59
00:06:06,357 --> 00:06:07,949
Fair, very fair.

60
00:06:21,305 --> 00:06:27,403
I am restless looking
at your eyes.

61
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:42,223
The people seeing.

62
00:06:42,393 --> 00:06:45,226
The people seeing.

63
00:06:45,429 --> 00:06:47,260
The people seeing.

64
00:06:47,431 --> 00:06:56,396
He people seeing say that
they are innocent eyes.

65
00:06:57,575 --> 00:07:01,204
I loose my sleep by
looking at them.

66
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:07,349
They are peculiar eyes.

67
00:07:14,658 --> 00:07:18,389
There are black eyes.

68
00:07:23,101 --> 00:07:25,194
A very fair face like the moon.

69
00:07:26,638 --> 00:07:28,469
Why do you praise me so much?

70
00:07:29,608 --> 00:07:30,472
Have you ever asked me in these
four years why I love...

71
00:07:30,642 --> 00:07:32,473
...you so much?

72
00:07:32,644 --> 00:07:34,475
I don it need to ask it.

73
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,513
I know you don it love me.

74
00:07:37,682 --> 00:07:39,513
I don it love you.
- No.

75
00:07:39,684 --> 00:07:41,515
On a very fair moon like face.
Killing eyes. Fair, very fair.

76
00:07:41,686 --> 00:07:43,517
I am restless looking
at your eyes.

77
00:07:43,688 --> 00:07:45,519
These are those eyes. Enough.

78
00:07:45,724 --> 00:07:47,555
What sought of an attack
are you getting?

79
00:07:47,726 --> 00:07:49,557
If it continues so you
will become mad.

80
00:07:49,728 --> 00:07:52,822
Madam, I am mad since when.

81
00:07:53,865 --> 00:07:54,456
So its solution.
- Marriage.

82
00:07:56,501 --> 00:08:00,699
If I marry you what
will happen to me?

83
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:03,604
So simple.

84
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:07,643
But today I am not so mad
that I will marry you.

85
00:08:09,815 --> 00:08:11,646
You are not mad?

86
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:15,650
How much mad?

87
00:08:16,188 --> 00:08:18,679
How much very mad?

88
00:08:19,858 --> 00:08:21,917
Very, very mad.

89
00:08:24,863 --> 00:08:26,728
You are mad, I am mad.

90
00:08:26,898 --> 00:08:28,729
I am mad you are mad.

91
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,835
Mad, mad.
- Mad is here.

92
00:08:32,904 --> 00:08:34,735
Today I will meet
your dad and go.

93
00:08:35,674 --> 00:08:38,507
If he does not agree we
will do a civil marriage.

94
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:42,771
No Neeraj. We will not
do a civil marriage.

95
00:08:43,381 --> 00:08:44,780
Wait for five six months.

96
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,918
I will make daddy agree.

97
00:08:47,018 --> 00:08:49,680
Run.

98
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,862
Anita.

99
00:09:08,473 --> 00:09:09,906
Why did Neeraj come here?

100
00:09:10,542 --> 00:09:12,908
I have told you.

101
00:09:18,316 --> 00:09:20,682
...here at night also.

102
00:09:26,925 --> 00:09:29,860
Anita.

103
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,806
Neeraj, I had told you
earlier that forget the water...

104
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:28,510
...not even on the land...

105
00:11:29,681 --> 00:11:31,239
Neeraj.
- Wow!

106
00:11:32,684 --> 00:11:33,446
I want to talk to you.
- Surely.

107
00:11:33,752 --> 00:11:37,381
Your talks are like beautiful
chain of pearls.

108
00:11:40,725 --> 00:11:42,556
I want to meet you alone.

109
00:11:43,728 --> 00:11:45,753
Neeraj, the thing I want to
tell you very important.

110
00:11:47,766 --> 00:11:48,357
For me, for you.

111
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:51,468
For both of us.

112
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,601
But what is the mystery?

113
00:11:55,807 --> 00:11:57,638
Come along with me.

114
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,684
Do you love me?
- Love!!

115
00:12:16,928 --> 00:12:19,590
Stop joking.

116
00:12:23,902 --> 00:12:26,735
And that is you.
- So will you marry me?

117
00:12:28,006 --> 00:12:31,635
You will marry me?
- Of course.

118
00:12:32,944 --> 00:12:33,706
But you told next year.
- Today.

119
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:36,571
Today.
- Now.

120
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:41,817
Now.
- At this moment.

121
00:12:42,987 --> 00:12:44,818
At this moment.

122
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:49,853
Why did you decide suddenly?

123
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,192
Don it ask me anything.

124
00:12:52,497 --> 00:12:53,657
I cannot tell you anything now.

125
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:58,900
Come with me. Come to
the registrar is office.

126
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,705
But Anita we will first
apply for the marriage.

127
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,776
I have done all
the arrangements.

128
00:13:12,183 --> 00:13:14,811
But we will need witnesses
over there.

129
00:13:23,661 --> 00:13:25,788
I Neerajkumar kashinath.

130

00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:52,119
Do the signature.

136
00:13:56,995 --> 00:13:59,054
Anita.

137
00:13:59,397 --> 00:14:04,198
If you sign here do you
know what will happen?

138
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:10,974
I am waiting outside
for you in the car.

139
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:16,538
I will wait for you
only for two minutes.

140
00:14:19,184 --> 00:14:22,119
I am sorry sir.

141
00:14:57,789 --> 00:15:01,190
There is no one at home.
- No one is at home.

142
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:05,295
I have told you so many times
there is no one at home.

143
00:15:05,396 --> 00:15:08,297
Please go.

144
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,334
Yes sir.

145
00:15:14,439 --> 00:15:17,340
You cannot meet her.

146
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,173
You don it have any right to
interfere in anyone is life.

147
00:15:20,345 --> 00:15:22,279
Why?

148
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,037
Because you are
not a decent man.

149
00:15:23,348 --> 00:15:25,179
Or else you would not have
tried to fool an innocent girl...

150
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,214
...and tried to marry her.

151
00:15:27,785 --> 00:15:29,218
You are wrong.

152
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:33,357
We were getting married
by Anita is permission.

153
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:36,453
She was committing a mistake.

154
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:41,321
Did you understand?
Now you can go.

155
00:15:41,532 --> 00:15:42,123
I will not go unless I meet her.

156
00:15:42,433 --> 00:15:44,264
Before I push you out of the
house by the servants go...

157
00:15:44,469 --> 00:15:46,403
...away from here.

158
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:47,128
Let is be sir. Don it get angry.

159
00:15:47,472 --> 00:15:51,408
If he wants to meet Anita
what is wrong in it?

160
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,545
She is up in her room.

161
00:15:57,515 --> 00:15:59,346
Your name.
- Neeraj.

162
00:16:04,555 --> 00:16:06,386
Hello. Anita.

163
00:16:07,525 --> 00:16:11,928
Mr. Neeraj wants
to speak to you.

164
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,430
Hello Anita.

165
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,433
I want to meet you.

166
00:16:19,871 --> 00:16:21,429
I cannot meet you.

167
00:16:23,408 --> 00:16:25,535
And I will never be
able to meet you.

168
00:16:27,645 --> 00:16:29,476
Why are you doing all this?

169
00:16:29,647 --> 00:16:32,582
You wanted to marry me.

170
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:35,719
And now.
- All that was a mistake.

171
00:16:36,054 --> 00:16:38,852
Forget me.
- Anita.

172
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:40,382
If you don it come down I will
understand that you did...

173
00:16:40,692 --> 00:16:43,661
...not want to marry me.

174
00:16:44,095 --> 00:16:46,393
And that to because I am
poor and you are rich.

175
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:49,424
Very rich.

176
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,471
Your introduction.
- I am Mr. Anil Sharma.

177
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:05,613
Mr. Anil Sharma is a very
big businessman over here.

178
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:09,878
He has got many mills and
factories over here.

179
00:17:10,788 --> 00:17:14,315
And very soon he is going
to get engaged to Anita.

180
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:15,516
No did you understand?

181
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,691
Now you may go.

182
00:17:35,747 --> 00:17:36,873
Neeraj, what is this madness?

183
00:17:37,048 --> 00:17:37,605
We will not let you go.

184
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:39,780
Come. You only make
him understand.

185
00:17:39,951 --> 00:17:42,044
He has resigned.

186
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:44,321
I have tried to make him
understand all night.

187
00:17:44,489 --> 00:17:44,784
But he is out focus.

188
00:17:45,957 --> 00:17:47,822
My dear Majnu. This is
nineteen sixty seven.

189
00:17:47,992 --> 00:17:49,926
Good morning sir.

190
00:17:50,094 --> 00:17:51,686
Good morning sir.
- Good morning sir.

191
00:17:51,996 --> 00:17:53,964
One minute please.

192
00:17:54,132 --> 00:17:54,689
What is this madness Neeraj?

193
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,863
Why are you leaving the job?

194
00:17:57,435 --> 00:17:58,868
It is due to some
personal problem.

195
00:17:59,437 --> 00:18:02,964
If I would not know your
circumstances I would have...

196
00:18:03,174 --> 00:18:06,234
...accepted your resignation.

197
00:18:07,078 --> 00:18:09,911
That is why take this back.
- I am sorry sir.

198
00:18:10,081 --> 00:18:11,912
I cannot stay here even
for a single day.

199
00:18:13,084 --> 00:18:15,052
Listen, Neeraj.

200
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:15,776
I will make you understand
something.

201
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,350
This is at cost of your life.

202
00:18:19,524 --> 00:18:20,821
Your entire life is
in front of you.

203
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:24,617
Your carriers, your ambition.

204
00:18:24,962 --> 00:18:26,088
I know everything. I can
understand everything.

205
00:18:26,264 --> 00:18:28,664
Then why are you leaving
your job for this?

206
00:18:28,966 --> 00:18:30,991
If you want I can transfer
you to Delhi.

207
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:34,261
Transfer.

208
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:37,234
I will send the order
today itself.

209
00:18:48,786 --> 00:18:51,186
Tell Delhi our hello as
soon as you reach there.

210
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,086
Ok Neeraj. All the best.

211
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:56,226
Take care of your health.
- Keep righting.

212
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,440
Congratulations sir.
- Congratulations sir.

213
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:23,447
You have got a wonderful groom.

214
00:19:30,528 --> 00:19:31,119
Sir.

215
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:39,402
What happened. - Anita?

216
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,161
What happened to Anita? Why
is she not coming down?

217
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:42,405
Anita.

218
00:19:42,607 --> 00:19:43,164
Again you are only saying
Anita, Anita.

219
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:46,307
Why are you not saying? What
has happened? - She has gone.

220
00:19:46,511 --> 00:19:48,342
What are you saying?
Where did Anita go?

221
00:19:52,517 --> 00:19:54,348
Daddy, I am going.

222
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:56,350
I will never come back now.

223
00:19:56,954 --> 00:19:59,354
Don it try to find me.

224
00:19:59,557 --> 00:20:01,388
Anita.

225
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:10,433
Anita has gone.
- Anita has gone.

226
00:20:10,601 --> 00:20:12,432
Yes.

227
00:20:30,488 --> 00:20:31,512
Hello. Police station.

228
00:20:32,657 --> 00:20:35,524
I am talking from Mr.
Biharilal's house.

229
00:20:35,726 --> 00:20:39,662
Yes. Just hold. Sir.

230
00:20:49,307 --> 00:20:52,674
Hello. I am Biharilal speaking.

231
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:58,739
My daughter Anita has
run away from home.

232
00:20:58,816 --> 00:21:03,651
Yes, We have got a note written
by her right now.

233
00:21:05,957 --> 00:21:07,515
Age is nineteen years.
Fair complexioned.

234
00:21:08,826 --> 00:21:10,691
Height five feet five inches.

235
00:21:11,963 --> 00:21:12,588
Name Anita.

236
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,400
Neeraj, I am in a big problem.

237
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:21,735
You come back to Bombay.

238
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:23,737
Anita.

239
00:21:28,045 --> 00:21:28,636
Please give me an ISD booking.

240
00:21:54,572 --> 00:21:54,867
Hello.
- Neeraj you.

241
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,007
Yes it is me.

242
00:21:57,174 --> 00:21:57,731
Who gave you the news?

243
00:21:58,542 --> 00:22:00,908
What news?

244
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:02,908
You don it know anything.

245
00:22:04,081 --> 00:22:05,912
About what?

246
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,951
She has written the letter
and called me here.

247
00:22:18,162 --> 00:22:21,654
What is the matter?
Why are you quite?

248
00:22:28,939 --> 00:22:32,033
When I heard it I
also felt the same.

249
00:22:33,611 --> 00:22:36,171
But when I read the news
paper I came to know...

250
00:22:36,347 --> 00:22:36,904
...that it was the truth.

251
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:58,164
How did this happen?

252
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,167
Why did this happen?

253
00:23:01,539 --> 00:23:04,167
I don it know this.

254
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:07,208
But I met inspector.
- What did he say?

255
00:23:07,378 --> 00:23:09,209
He said that...

256
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,974
...she was not in the house
for three days.

257
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,748
The police was searching
her for many days.

258
00:23:19,423 --> 00:23:22,358
They did the post
mortem of the body.

259
00:23:23,427 --> 00:23:26,521
And then handed the
body to her father.

260
00:23:28,566 --> 00:23:31,160
I cannot understand
why she did so?

261
00:23:31,469 --> 00:23:33,300
Why did she commit suicide?

262
00:23:53,691 --> 00:23:56,251
I came to know just now.

263
00:23:56,594 --> 00:23:58,425
I cannot understand how
all this happened.

264
00:23:58,596 --> 00:24:01,531
Why did Anita commit suicide?

265
00:24:03,601 --> 00:24:05,569
I know sir.

266
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:08,296
The grief of losing
your only daughter.

267
00:24:08,639 --> 00:24:10,470
I want to forget all this.

268
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:15,337
Some days back I got her letter.

269
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,739
Anita is letter.

270
00:24:20,684 --> 00:24:24,552
She had also written that her
self respect was in danger.

271
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:30,559
Why did Anita commit suicide?

272
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:35,330
...there would be no question
about suicide.

273
00:24:36,801 --> 00:24:39,326
She was going to get
married very soon.

274
00:24:41,739 --> 00:24:43,604
Was marriage the cause
of this suicide?

275
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:47,744
...her permission.

276
00:24:50,214 --> 00:24:52,648
This is due to a doubt.

277
00:24:52,817 --> 00:24:54,910
Doubt.

278
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:00,548
There was nothing.

279
00:25:00,858 --> 00:25:03,793
You don it know it or you
don it want to tell me.

280
00:25:04,862 --> 00:25:07,729
Think I don it want to.

281
00:25:07,932 --> 00:25:11,595
Because you will not
be able to bear it.

282
00:25:12,336 --> 00:25:13,735
I want to hear it.

283
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:21,509
She was going to become a
mother before her marriage.

284
00:25:50,074 --> 00:25:55,910
Everything is dark without her.

285
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:01,950
Everything is dark without her.

286
00:26:02,553 --> 00:26:06,956
There is a special thing in her.

287
00:26:15,232 --> 00:26:18,895
Every thing is similar.

288
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:23,367
But her eyes are special.

289
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:31,079
On a very fair moon like face.

290
00:26:36,253 --> 00:26:38,118
Fair, very fair.

291
00:26:45,963 --> 00:26:49,490
You are not capable
to touch her photo.

292
00:26:51,335 --> 00:26:53,166
What do you mean?

293
00:26:53,337 --> 00:26:53,962
It means that Anita has not
committed suicide but...

294
00:26:54,138 --> 00:26:58,040
...she has been murdered and
you are responsible for that.

295
00:27:03,814 --> 00:27:05,213
Think about it.

296
00:27:05,382 --> 00:27:08,977
If I would have forced Anita
then why would I tell her no.

297
00:27:10,187 --> 00:27:13,122
...problem in it.

298
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:16,256
No Neeraj.

299
00:27:22,466 --> 00:27:24,297
Who else?

300
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:31,208
Someone who was not successful
in Anita is love.

301
00:27:31,575 --> 00:27:34,373
Someone who could
not achieve her.

302
00:27:35,512 --> 00:27:39,278
And in this anger he took
revenge from her.

303
00:27:41,318 --> 00:27:44,253
That she committed suicide.

304
00:27:44,355 --> 00:27:47,256
Such a person.

305
00:27:48,592 --> 00:27:50,423
Like you.

306
00:27:51,362 --> 00:27:56,322
When you blamed me
I also got angry.

307
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,301
But now I am not angry.

308
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,228
Because you have gone
crazy in Anita is love.

309
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,240
I also have loved Anita.

310
00:28:06,443 --> 00:28:10,379
And the people who love do
not spoil anybody is life.

311
00:28:11,749 --> 00:28:14,274
Then how did all this happen?

312
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:18,387
Anita was not a spoilt girl.

313
00:28:18,722 --> 00:28:21,282
The Anita which we
know is not spoilt.

314
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:25,556
But the other Anita.

315
00:28:29,767 --> 00:28:31,598
Anita was a weird girl.

316
00:28:35,572 --> 00:28:39,474
Different aspects, moods.

317
00:28:39,576 --> 00:28:42,545
I also do not believe the
things which I hear.

318
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:46,640
But I have seen something
with my eyes.

319
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,717
Neeraj today I will tell
you a strange incident.

320
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:52,879
Once we all had gone to Shimla.

321
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,689
There was a fancy dress
ball over there.

322
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:07,602
You have done a very
good job in Shimla.

323
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:11,674
It is very enjoyable.

324
00:29:12,009 --> 00:29:15,638
It is fun only if you come.

325
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,811
Thank you. Thank you.

326
00:29:20,984 --> 00:29:23,817
What get up have you taken? - 
Have you forgotten your history?

327
00:29:23,987 --> 00:29:24,612
I have forgotten.
- King Chandra Gupt.

328
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:28,684
Cheers to the king. And you?

329
00:29:32,029 --> 00:29:33,656
In this get up.
- Forget the get up.

330
00:29:33,831 --> 00:29:36,732
I am his Queen for
all his births.

331
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:38,500
This is very nice.

332
00:29:44,274 --> 00:29:47,903
Kiran, you scared us.

333
00:29:50,114 --> 00:29:50,842
Yes I did see her but.

334
00:29:51,181 --> 00:29:53,809
Take him away.

335
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:56,750
He is a non vegetarian.
- No he is a vegetarian.

336
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,821
Sir. Sir. Anita madam.

337
00:30:00,157 --> 00:30:00,748
What happened?
- Ms. Anita is dancing.

338
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:03,188
Where is she dancing?
- Behind.

339
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,760
What rubbish?
- Please come and see.

340
00:30:08,966 --> 00:30:11,901
Oh God! She is dancing.

341
00:30:55,078 --> 00:31:01,244
How do I talk about love?

342
00:31:06,924 --> 00:31:10,291
No, no, no.

343
00:31:21,605 --> 00:31:25,006
How do I talk about love?

344
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:28,041
No, no, no.

345
00:31:28,212 --> 00:31:31,045
The old man is coughing behind.

346
00:31:31,215 --> 00:31:36,050
The old man is coughing behind.

347
00:32:05,182 --> 00:32:10,279
There are black bangles
on fair hand.

348
00:32:12,923 --> 00:32:16,086
There are black bangles
on fair hand.

349
00:32:17,527 --> 00:32:19,119
In fair hands.

350
00:32:19,429 --> 00:32:21,260
Who will I show my face
in the morning the...

351
00:32:21,431 --> 00:32:24,434
...noise of the bangles?

352
00:32:24,434 --> 00:32:26,265
Who will I show my face
in the morning the...

353
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:29,405
...noise of the bangles?

354
00:32:29,873 --> 00:32:33,536
I am joining my hands
applied with heena.

355
00:32:34,611 --> 00:32:36,169
No, no, no.

356
00:32:36,513 --> 00:32:39,346
The old man is coughing behind.

357
00:32:39,516 --> 00:32:41,347
No, no, no.

358
00:32:41,518 --> 00:32:44,351
The old man is coughing behind.

359
00:33:14,084 --> 00:33:18,521
The bride wears the
Bindi like the moon.

360
00:33:21,692 --> 00:33:26,652
The bride wears
the Bindi like the moon.

361
00:33:28,732 --> 00:33:34,671
She has got a little sleep
in her big eyes.

362
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:45,611
No, no, no.

363
00:33:45,816 --> 00:33:48,649
The old man is coughing behind.

364
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:50,650
No, no, no.

365
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:54,757
The old man is coughing behind.

366
00:34:17,948 --> 00:34:22,783
Why are you removing my scarf?

367
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:29,823
Why are you removing my scarf?

368
00:34:29,993 --> 00:34:32,826
Removing my scarf.

369
00:34:32,996 --> 00:34:38,093
Everybody is seeing this.

370
00:34:38,835 --> 00:34:41,861
Everybody is seeing this.

371
00:34:43,173 --> 00:34:47,109
They are saying look
at this meeting.

372
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,773
No, no, no.

373
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:53,015
The old man is coughing behind.

374
00:34:53,483 --> 00:34:55,576
No, no, no.

375
00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:56,908
The old man is coughing behind.

376
00:34:58,655 --> 00:35:02,022
How do I talk about love?

377
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,818
How do I talk about love?

378
00:35:07,164 --> 00:35:08,995
No, no, no.

379
00:35:09,166 --> 00:35:12,658
The old man is coughing behind.

380
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:23,076
Anita. Who Anita?

381
00:35:23,244 --> 00:35:25,075
Be conscious. What
happened to you?

382
00:35:25,246 --> 00:35:27,214
How did you come here?

383
00:35:27,781 --> 00:35:28,110
Here.

384
00:35:35,289 --> 00:35:37,120
Anita.

385
00:35:38,425 --> 00:35:39,016
What happened? What happened?

386
00:35:40,861 --> 00:35:42,158
She was a weird girl.
How did she come here?

387
00:35:42,329 --> 00:35:44,160
How did she know our song?

388
00:35:44,331 --> 00:35:46,162
And she had worn similar
clothes like us.

389
00:35:46,367 --> 00:35:51,270
Please move behind.

390
00:35:52,373 --> 00:35:55,206
I think it is a case
of split personality.

391
00:35:55,376 --> 00:35:57,469
Split personality.

392
00:35:57,778 --> 00:36:00,110
This is the name of
a strange disease.

393
00:36:00,814 --> 00:36:04,215
When a person gets an attack of
this they forget themselves.

394
00:36:04,418 --> 00:36:07,251
They continue in the
same way they are in.

395
00:36:07,454 --> 00:36:09,285
You understand it as.

396
00:36:09,456 --> 00:36:12,289
If they have worn a beggars
clothes they consider...

397
00:36:12,459 --> 00:36:14,290
...themselves as beggars.

398
00:36:14,461 --> 00:36:16,429
And if they have worn a kings
clothes they consider...

399
00:36:16,597 --> 00:36:17,154
...themselves as a king.

400
00:36:17,498 --> 00:36:21,400
Today when this girl wore
the clothes of the tribes.

401
00:36:21,602 --> 00:36:24,571
She completely forgot herself.

402
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,197
...reached there.

403
00:36:27,541 --> 00:36:30,908
Our rebirth is also
this, doctor.

404
00:36:33,681 --> 00:36:34,238
...in a tribe.

405
00:36:34,548 --> 00:36:37,517
And by wearing these clothes
she remembered about...

406
00:36:37,685 --> 00:36:38,242
...her last life.

407
00:36:38,585 --> 00:36:41,520
And she went with those people.

408
00:36:42,022 --> 00:36:43,421
Today.

409
00:36:44,992 --> 00:36:47,517
Today I think about it.

410
00:36:47,728 --> 00:36:53,360
When did Anita take a get
up and what did she do.

411
00:36:54,635 --> 00:36:56,466
Who knows who he was?

412
00:36:58,038 --> 00:36:59,369
Who took the advantage
of Anita is that state.

413
00:37:04,478 --> 00:37:06,639
After a long time she must have
realized that she was...

414
00:37:06,814 --> 00:37:07,405
...pregnant.

415
00:37:11,118 --> 00:37:11,413
So she committed suicide.

416
00:37:13,721 --> 00:37:15,552
How do I believe you?

417
00:37:17,858 --> 00:37:18,586
I have known Anita
very personally.

418
00:37:21,729 --> 00:37:24,459
But I have never noticed
anything like this.

419
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,631
Come with me.

420
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:45,544
The Anita whom we know will
never agree to make a...

421
00:37:45,853 --> 00:37:47,684
...painting like this.

422
00:37:51,992 --> 00:37:52,617
But this is Anita is painting.

423
00:37:55,295 --> 00:37:57,263
When I asked her I came
to know that she...

424
00:37:57,431 --> 00:37:58,489
...did not know anything
about this painting.

425
00:37:59,933 --> 00:38:03,869
She didn it even know who
made this painting.

426
00:38:04,471 --> 00:38:05,768
The name of the painter
and his address.

427
00:38:05,939 --> 00:38:07,770
It is written in my dairy.

428
00:38:07,975 --> 00:38:09,806
Come with me.

429
00:39:35,329 --> 00:39:37,160
Get out.

430
00:39:38,465 --> 00:39:39,022
I have come to meet you.

431
00:39:39,366 --> 00:39:41,197
But I have not come to meet you.

432
00:39:41,368 --> 00:39:43,302
Out.

433
00:39:43,837 --> 00:39:46,203
Who are you?

434
00:39:46,373 --> 00:39:49,467
Why are you? What are you?

435
00:39:51,512 --> 00:39:53,776
That is why I am telling
you to get out.

436
00:39:54,414 --> 00:39:56,382
Out.

437
00:39:56,817 --> 00:39:57,112
So then meet a devil.

438
00:40:01,455 --> 00:40:03,514
Good.

439
00:40:03,857 --> 00:40:04,152
Pick me up.

440
00:40:09,596 --> 00:40:10,187
Very tall devil. Sit down.

441
00:40:11,498 --> 00:40:12,658
Thank you.
- Devils are real.

442
00:40:12,966 --> 00:40:15,332
All humans are unreal.

443
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,231
All those who come, they
come along with flies.

444
00:40:24,545 --> 00:40:26,376
Do you understand modern art?

445
00:40:28,582 --> 00:40:29,606
No.
- I also don it understand.

446
00:40:31,585 --> 00:40:33,416
I kill flies over here.

447
00:40:33,587 --> 00:40:35,418
But people understand it.

448
00:40:38,625 --> 00:40:40,456
It flew away.

449
00:40:45,632 --> 00:40:48,226
I cannot understand
anything about it.

450
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:51,501
You will understand
if it has something.

451
00:40:54,675 --> 00:40:56,506
This is a cow eating grass.

452
00:40:58,712 --> 00:41:00,145
But where is the grass?
- The cow ate it.

453
00:41:02,716 --> 00:41:05,651
But the cow is also not there.
- She has eaten and left.

454
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:07,812
You do not understand
modern art.

455
00:41:08,755 --> 00:41:10,586
Can you see this?

456
00:41:11,758 --> 00:41:13,692
Yes.

457
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:14,451
This is a combination
beauty and youth.

458
00:41:14,761 --> 00:41:16,854
Cleopatra.

459
00:41:18,799 --> 00:41:20,630
But we cannot see anything.

460
00:41:20,801 --> 00:41:22,632
I had made it at night
in the dark.

461
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:29,909
I have come to you for a work.

462
00:41:31,845 --> 00:41:34,678
But you were talking right now.

463
00:41:36,984 --> 00:41:37,575
Then it must be Monday. Tell me.

464
00:41:39,886 --> 00:41:43,822
Do you know Anita?

465
00:41:43,957 --> 00:41:46,585
I know her very well.

466
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,588
Anita is such a girl...

467
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:51,659
...that if you see her once, you
will remember her for life.

468
00:41:53,934 --> 00:41:55,765
Help me up...

469
00:41:57,971 --> 00:41:59,802
She is a great lady.

470
00:42:00,974 --> 00:42:03,807
Great! A great slut.

471
00:42:03,977 --> 00:42:05,808
What are you saying??

472
00:42:11,018 --> 00:42:12,849
You have only seen the portrait.

473
00:42:13,987 --> 00:42:14,715
I have seen the girl.

474
00:42:15,022 --> 00:42:18,219
The portrait is art,
the girl a slut.

475
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,994
There is some misunderstanding.

476
00:42:23,864 --> 00:42:26,765
Maybe you don it know.

477
00:42:31,104 --> 00:42:32,935
Suicide?
- Yes.

478
00:42:33,106 --> 00:42:34,937
Very good.

479
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:39,811
One should be very glad
or else she would...

480
00:42:40,147 --> 00:42:41,978
...have died elsewhere.

481
00:42:42,149 --> 00:42:43,980
Many men would ive turned insane.

482
00:42:44,951 --> 00:42:47,852
Tell me what is your problem?

483
00:42:49,589 --> 00:42:50,351
Anita was pregnant.

484
00:42:50,957 --> 00:42:53,949
That is very natural, only
women get pregnant.

485
00:42:54,261 --> 00:42:57,890
Anita was a lady and only
she can get pregnant.

486
00:42:58,231 --> 00:43:00,062
I cannot do it.

487
00:43:00,634 --> 00:43:03,068
But I only want to know who
caused her this misery...

488
00:43:03,236 --> 00:43:06,069
...and lead her to
commit suicide.

489
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:08,070
It could ive been anybody.

490
00:43:08,275 --> 00:43:08,866
She was a multifaceted lady,
you may have...

491
00:43:09,042 --> 00:43:12,045
...seen one side of
her and me another...

492
00:43:12,045 --> 00:43:14,980
Which side did you see?

493
00:43:17,284 --> 00:43:19,149
Her true color.

494
00:43:23,123 --> 00:43:28,026
I was once on my
way to Hong Kong.

495
00:44:41,401 --> 00:44:46,270
I can see very closely.

496
00:44:48,708 --> 00:44:53,873
I may or may not be
able to meet later.

497
00:44:54,915 --> 00:44:59,318
I can see very closely.

498
00:45:01,755 --> 00:45:04,383
I may or may not be
able to meet later.

499
00:45:04,558 --> 00:45:13,523
This garden of my wishes
may blossom or may not.

500
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,403
I can see very closely.

501
00:45:20,841 --> 00:45:24,675
I may or may not be
able to meet later.

502
00:45:57,043 --> 00:46:05,747
My heart is craving for
one look from you.

503
00:46:05,819 --> 00:46:14,784
My heart is craving for
one look from you.

504
00:46:17,063 --> 00:46:23,696
Your one look is enough
for my entire life.

505
00:46:26,106 --> 00:46:29,974
Show me your love by your eyes.

506
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:32,737
You lips are moving
or not moving.

507
00:46:33,246 --> 00:46:38,980
I can see very closely.

508
00:46:45,191 --> 00:46:48,024
I can see very closely.

509
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:16,155
Look up there is a beauty
standing in front of you.

510
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:43,176
This garden of my wishes
may blossom or may not.

511
00:47:44,217 --> 00:47:46,947
I can see very closely.

512
00:47:48,154 --> 00:47:54,320
I may or may not be
able to meet later.

513
00:48:01,234 --> 00:48:03,065
Very nice.

514
00:48:05,238 --> 00:48:07,069
Everybody says so.

515
00:48:07,273 --> 00:48:09,104
You sing very nicely.

516
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:13,176
You also dance very well.

517
00:48:13,246 --> 00:48:16,306
What is your name?

518
00:48:19,319 --> 00:48:21,150
Sapna.

519
00:48:23,423 --> 00:48:26,358
Aradhana.

520
00:48:26,459 --> 00:48:29,360
Then.

521
00:48:30,330 --> 00:48:33,128
Anita.

522
00:48:42,809 --> 00:48:43,104
Where are you going?

523
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:51,141
Lmpossible.

524
00:48:57,857 --> 00:48:58,152
Listen.

525
00:49:00,026 --> 00:49:02,392
Anita was exactly as I said.

526
00:49:02,495 --> 00:49:04,326
Listen to me.

527
00:49:04,497 --> 00:49:07,330
Forget her. As I have
forgotten her.

528
00:49:10,070 --> 00:49:15,474
A pretty women should be
remembered not a painful one.

529
00:49:15,542 --> 00:49:17,373
She was not a pain.

530
00:49:18,945 --> 00:49:19,240
Listen to another advice.

531
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:22,411
Get out.

532
00:49:37,664 --> 00:49:40,599
Mr. Neeraj, whatever
information you have...

533
00:49:40,767 --> 00:49:42,359
...given us about Anita,
we knew it already.

534
00:49:42,669 --> 00:49:47,629
According to our information,
all these are known facts.

535
00:49:49,109 --> 00:49:50,542
Mr. Neeraj, after all the
information gathered...

536
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:52,541
...we have closed the case.

537
00:49:54,714 --> 00:49:56,682
Ok.

538
00:49:56,850 --> 00:50:00,786
I will advise you to forget
all these things.

539
00:50:06,893 --> 00:50:07,450
What happened, brother?

540
00:50:08,895 --> 00:50:09,452
Nothing.

541
00:50:09,796 --> 00:50:11,627
Police has closed the case.

542
00:50:12,799 --> 00:50:14,630
They cannot solve my problem.

543
00:50:15,802 --> 00:50:16,496
I told you before, the police
has nothing to do...

544
00:50:16,836 --> 00:50:19,896
...with Anita is personal life.

545
00:50:22,242 --> 00:50:25,211
The most famous detective
is my friend.

546
00:50:25,645 --> 00:50:26,805
We can give this case to him.

547
00:50:31,284 --> 00:50:31,579

How are you?

553
00:51:41,588 --> 00:51:41,883
Hello, sir.

00:51:46,326 --> 00:51:46,883

00:51:53,233 --> 00:51:55,064
Who are you?

558
00:51:56,236 --> 00:51:59,763

00:52:03,376 --> 00:52:04,968
My detective name is Rajdan.

560
00:52:05,278 --> 00:52:08,247
People call me Roshandaan.

561
00:52:09,415 --> 00:52:10,006
This is an important case.

562
00:52:11,284 --> 00:52:13,013
Case number 9534.

563
00:52:16,756 --> 00:52:18,155
What is all this noise about?

564
00:52:18,458 --> 00:52:20,119
Is this an office
or a fish market?

565
00:52:22,895 --> 00:52:23,190
Ok tell me what is the case?

566
00:52:23,363 --> 00:52:26,196
Robbery? Dacoity? Bank robbery?
Love Affair?

567
00:52:26,366 --> 00:52:28,197
Murder? Kidnapping?

568
00:52:28,501 --> 00:52:30,469
No, it is a case of Suicide.

569
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:31,099
Oh! We are specialists
in suicide cases.

570
00:52:31,404 --> 00:52:34,339
Let me know, which of you
wishes to commit suicide?

571
00:52:34,807 --> 00:52:35,102
My dear friend, nobody wants
to commit suicide...

572
00:52:35,408 --> 00:52:37,205
...it has already
been committed.

573
00:52:37,543 --> 00:52:39,101
Very good. Then it is
a very simple case.

574
00:52:40,446 --> 00:52:43,279
Have you heard about the
Anita suicide case?

575
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:46,281
Anita suicide case?

576
00:53:10,576 --> 00:53:12,407
Would you like to have
some coca cola?

577
00:53:26,059 --> 00:53:29,551
Anita case? Anita suicide case?

578
00:53:30,663 --> 00:53:35,430
I want you to take the charge
of complete investigation.

579
00:53:36,669 --> 00:53:39,536
...I will make complete
chart and give you.

580
00:53:40,807 --> 00:53:41,398
Oh no, right from Anita is
birth to her suicide...

581
00:53:41,708 --> 00:53:45,644
...We will make a complete
chart and give you.

582
00:53:45,845 --> 00:53:46,402
Just give me some details.

583
00:53:46,713 --> 00:53:49,580
Please note them down.
- Tell me.

584
00:53:49,749 --> 00:53:52,684
Yes, yes, she was a slut.

585
00:53:52,852 --> 00:53:53,443
But why should it bother you?

586
00:53:53,753 --> 00:53:56,722
You are aware of the
circumstances she...

587
00:53:56,889 --> 00:53:57,446
...committed suicide in.

588
00:53:57,790 --> 00:54:03,729
You know that she is dead
and with her all her vices.

589
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:08,894
The scar on her forehead has
been washed by her death.

590
00:54:09,936 --> 00:54:10,527
But you are still not convinced.

591
00:54:11,838 --> 00:54:13,669
But sir.
- Anita is dead.

592
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:17,332
When she was alive,
you were behind her.

593
00:54:19,278 --> 00:54:22,714
You want to bring out her
vices before the world...

594
00:54:22,882 --> 00:54:25,817
...and tarnish her name.

595
00:54:26,018 --> 00:54:26,746
I say that not she
but you are a hag.

596
00:54:29,021 --> 00:54:31,615
What is it that you want?

597
00:54:31,924 --> 00:54:34,757
What revenge are you seeking?
What do you want?

598
00:54:34,927 --> 00:54:37,896
Which life are you seeking
revenge for?

599
00:54:43,069 --> 00:54:43,660
Get out.

600
00:55:04,824 --> 00:55:07,884
Anita, my child.

601
00:55:20,239 --> 00:55:26,235
There is no peace
even after seeing...

602
00:55:26,679 --> 00:55:31,548
There is no peace
even after seeing...

603
00:55:32,185 --> 00:55:37,020
After giving I lost
my peace of mind.

604
00:58:39,005 --> 00:58:40,836
Sleeping man.

605
00:58:41,007 --> 00:58:42,838
What is this non sense?

606
00:58:47,813 --> 00:58:50,714
Sleeping child.

607
00:58:51,050 --> 00:58:52,881
Get up, get up.

608
00:58:55,054 --> 00:58:56,851
What office is this?

609
00:58:58,057 --> 00:58:59,922
Oh my God!

610
00:59:00,092 --> 00:59:01,889
Sleeping family.

611
00:59:03,095 --> 00:59:04,926
Mr.

612
00:59:07,166 --> 00:59:09,134
I am not your husband.
- Yes.

613
00:59:09,335 --> 00:59:12,498
My husband is lost.

614
00:59:13,139 --> 00:59:15,972
Very simple. Please sit. Sit.

615
00:59:19,812 --> 00:59:22,212
Where did your husband get lost?

616
00:59:24,183 --> 00:59:27,016
He went to office yesterday
and did not return till now.

617
00:59:27,186 --> 00:59:29,017
He did not come home yet.

618
00:59:30,222 --> 00:59:33,055
So this means he is lost
somewhere between...

619
00:59:33,225 --> 00:59:36,058
...the office and the house.

620
00:59:36,295 --> 00:59:38,923
I searched everywhere
between the...

621
00:59:39,265 --> 00:59:41,062
...office and the house.

622
00:59:42,268 --> 00:59:44,099
Not to be found anywhere.

623
00:59:45,271 --> 00:59:45,896
Where all does he go
other than office?

624
00:59:46,072 --> 00:59:49,974
To his friends. But I
went to his friends.

625
00:59:50,076 --> 00:59:52,044
Went to the police station,
hospital.

626
00:59:52,378 --> 00:59:55,006
But he is not to be
found anywhere.

627
00:59:55,314 --> 00:59:57,145
Does he have girl friend?

628
00:59:59,351 --> 01:00:02,184
What are you talking?
He loves me a lot.

629
01:00:02,354 --> 01:00:04,185
Do you have a boy friend?

630
01:00:04,356 --> 01:00:06,187
You damn fool.

631
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:10,225

632
01:00:10,396 --> 01:00:12,227

I am saying you have
to find my husband.

647
01:01:13,659 --> 01:01:15,490

656
01:01:56,902 --> 01:01:59,427
I saw her with my own eyes.

657
01:02:00,873 --> 01:02:02,704
She also saw me.

658
01:02:05,678 --> 01:02:09,614
I want you to go to that
house and investigate it.

659
01:02:10,916 --> 01:02:11,940
Whose house is it and

660
01:02:13,919 --> 01:02:16,752
What relation did Anita have
with that house or what...

661
01:02:16,922 --> 01:02:18,753

- Note it.

663
01:02:46,118 --> 01:02:48,746
It is such a big bungalow.

664
01:02:49,088 --> 01:02:51,921
But we cannot see
anybody over here.

665
01:02:52,091 --> 01:02:53,922
Then whose laughter was that.

666
01:02:55,895 --> 01:02:58,796
Hello sir.

667
01:02:58,864 --> 01:02:59,853
Hello.

668
01:03:00,165 --> 01:03:03,828
Sir whom does this
place belongs to?

669
01:03:04,136 --> 01:03:04,727
Why have you to ask about it?

670
01:03:04,937 --> 01:03:07,770
Because if this place
is empty we may stay...

671
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:11,000
...here for some days.

672
01:03:11,944 --> 01:03:14,879
No sir.

673
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:15,805
You cannot stay here.
- Why?

674
01:03:15,981 --> 01:03:18,347
Because three people stay here.

675
01:03:18,684 --> 01:03:21,050
Who three?

676
01:03:28,227 --> 01:03:31,094
Tall, fair and thin.

677
01:03:33,032 --> 01:03:35,967
Who else stays here?

678
01:03:36,268 --> 01:03:38,099
And your two fathers.

679
01:03:43,309 --> 01:03:45,140
The other one might be mine.

680
01:03:46,512 --> 01:03:49,140
When do we get to see them?

681
01:03:49,348 --> 01:03:51,179
At night twelve.

682
01:03:51,350 --> 01:03:53,181
Night twelve.

683
01:04:15,507 --> 01:04:19,136
Is it the time for them to come?

684
01:04:25,284 --> 01:04:28,185
Who stays here?
- Ghosts.

685
01:04:32,291 --> 01:04:35,226
Why are you getting scared?

686
01:04:36,328 --> 01:04:39,229
Or else we both will be killed.

687
01:04:39,598 --> 01:04:43,261
You are getting scared in
spite of being my disciple.

688
01:04:47,373 --> 01:04:50,342
I have seen many big ghosts.

689
01:05:02,321 --> 01:05:04,152
What happened to your voice?

690
01:05:13,465 --> 01:05:16,400
He is the first ghost.

691
01:05:28,447 --> 01:05:30,506
One is gone.

692
01:05:30,816 --> 01:05:31,145
Now who is the second one?

693
01:05:31,450 --> 01:05:33,281
Now a female ghost will come.

694
01:05:34,453 --> 01:05:36,284
Female ghost.

695
01:06:00,579 --> 01:06:02,410
Who is the third ghost?

696
01:06:06,585 --> 01:06:09,554
I am the third ghost.

697
01:06:23,068 --> 01:06:25,593
Unless we go in that bungalow.

698
01:06:28,807 --> 01:06:29,364
Don it take the name
of that bungalow.

699
01:06:29,708 --> 01:06:31,539
If it has got three ghosts
outside the house...

700
01:06:31,710 --> 01:06:33,541
...what will it have inside.

701
01:06:35,714 --> 01:06:37,545
Sacrifice.
- Sacrifice.

702
01:06:37,749 --> 01:06:39,580
The ones given to ghosts.

703
01:06:39,751 --> 01:06:43,243
After that the ghosts get
happy and leave the place.

704
01:06:43,555 --> 01:06:44,544
What is this sacrifice?

705
01:06:44,890 --> 01:06:46,448
Anything living.
- Like a hen or a cock.

706
01:06:46,758 --> 01:06:48,589
Cat or a goat.

707
01:06:52,898 --> 01:06:53,489
Boss a goat.

708
01:06:53,799 --> 01:06:55,596
Goat.

709
01:06:55,934 --> 01:06:57,902
No. Mr. Joseph.

710
01:06:58,203 --> 01:06:58,498
Joseph Dekar.

711
01:06:58,837 --> 01:07:01,897
Yes, yes. Come in Mr. Goat.

712
01:07:02,374 --> 01:07:05,343
No son. I am not a goat.

713
01:07:05,844 --> 01:07:07,675
Joseph Dekar.

714
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:09,711
Good morning Mr. Dekar.

715
01:07:09,882 --> 01:07:11,941
What can we do for you?

716
01:07:12,284 --> 01:07:13,581
Who much do you charge
for finding a husband?

717
01:07:13,886 --> 01:07:15,683
Six hundred rupees.

718
01:07:16,021 --> 01:07:17,579
And how much will you
take to lose him?

719
01:07:17,923 --> 01:07:19,720
To lose.

720
01:07:20,025 --> 01:07:23,426
There is such a case.
This case is here.

721
01:07:24,930 --> 01:07:26,727
Take me away.

722
01:07:27,065 --> 01:07:27,622
Take me away from my wife.

723
01:07:28,367 --> 01:07:29,800
Where is my husband?
Where is he?

724
01:07:29,968 --> 01:07:31,799
I am dead.

725
01:07:31,970 --> 01:07:33,767
Dead.

726
01:07:39,011 --> 01:07:43,072
Hey, not here. - Gorkha, move aside.

727
01:07:43,815 --> 01:07:44,839
I have given him an advance
of rupees four hundred.

728
01:07:45,017 --> 01:07:49,386
I will go inside and see.

729
01:07:51,156 --> 01:07:54,125
As the people inside are mad
the watch man is also mad.

730
01:08:00,199 --> 01:08:03,134
Now where is my husband?

731
01:08:04,069 --> 01:08:04,797
Madam he is not here.

732
01:08:05,103 --> 01:08:06,900
Idiot.

733
01:08:07,239 --> 01:08:07,796
I also know that he is not here.

734
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:11,200
You both are cheats.

735
01:08:11,510 --> 01:08:13,637
Where is he?

736
01:08:14,146 --> 01:08:16,979
It is a statue madam.
- What happened to him?

737
01:08:17,149 --> 01:08:19,242
His screw had become
a bit loose.

738
01:08:19,551 --> 01:08:23,544
A little loose. All your
screws are loose here.

739
01:08:23,722 --> 01:08:24,017
Unnecessarily.

740
01:08:27,192 --> 01:08:28,887
Why are you keeping broken
things over here?

741
01:08:39,671 --> 01:08:42,071
Now listen to me Mr.

742
01:08:43,075 --> 01:08:46,203
If I don it get my husband over
here till six in the evening.

743
01:08:46,979 --> 01:08:47,968
Not me. Not me.

744
01:08:48,313 --> 01:08:51,146
Give you to the police.
- To the police.

745
01:08:51,316 --> 01:08:53,147
Yes.
- Yes alright.

746
01:08:57,322 --> 01:09:00,189
What happened? Who sneezed?

747
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:03,157
You. But the noise
came from here.

748
01:09:03,462 --> 01:09:06,431
Madam everything is
automatic here.

749
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:15,235
Impossible.

750
01:09:21,980 --> 01:09:24,346
Hey watchman, get out.

751
01:09:24,449 --> 01:09:26,280
Sir, help me.

752
01:09:26,451 --> 01:09:30,387
I have died. Save me.

753
01:09:32,591 --> 01:09:35,560
Everything will get
alright to night.

754
01:09:58,617 --> 01:10:00,448
Boss it is twelve o clock.

755
01:10:00,619 --> 01:10:02,450
Now the ghosts will come.

756
01:10:03,021 --> 01:10:04,454
And they will take
the sacrifice.

757
01:10:05,590 --> 01:10:09,993
And then we both will go
and search the house.

758
01:10:21,707 --> 01:10:23,504
You idiot.

759
01:10:23,809 --> 01:10:24,400
You thought I did
not understand...

760
01:10:24,710 --> 01:10:26,507
...anything in the office.

761
01:10:27,512 --> 01:10:28,501
I had understood everything.

762
01:10:29,114 --> 01:10:31,639
You have come here to
be the sacrifice.

763
01:10:33,852 --> 01:10:35,444
I will take you home
and make you a cock.

764
01:10:35,754 --> 01:10:38,848
Save me.

765
01:10:40,792 --> 01:10:43,625
I am dead. I am dead.

766
01:10:53,805 --> 01:10:54,533
We have got the first sacrifice.

767
01:10:56,975 --> 01:10:57,532
They have got the sacrifice.

768
01:10:57,843 --> 01:10:59,674
Boss they have got
the sacrifice.

769
01:10:59,978 --> 01:11:00,535
Get another sacrifice.

770
01:11:03,882 --> 01:11:06,715
He is calling you. I am going.

771
01:11:06,885 --> 01:11:09,718
I also want the third sacrifice.

772
01:11:12,023 --> 01:11:13,615
The third sacrifice
is also needed.

773
01:11:14,926 --> 01:11:16,757
The third sacrifice.

774
01:11:23,769 --> 01:11:25,760
Why do you want the
third sacrifice?

775
01:11:26,938 --> 01:11:28,667
Three ghosts stay here.

776
01:11:30,008 --> 01:11:32,841
Three ghosts, three sacrifices.

777
01:11:39,151 --> 01:11:42,552
Sit down.
- Did you come to know anything?

778
01:11:44,055 --> 01:11:45,886
Our decision is that Anita does
not have any relation...

779
01:11:46,057 --> 01:11:47,888
...with this bungalow.

780
01:11:48,059 --> 01:11:50,152
What do you mean?
- It is very simple.

781
01:11:50,462 --> 01:11:52,589
It means that Anita
committed suicide.

782
01:11:54,099 --> 01:11:55,930
...that he saw her.

783
01:11:56,101 --> 01:11:57,693
Just like Majnu use
to see his Laila.

784
01:11:59,137 --> 01:12:02,629
Like that Neeraj can
see Anita everywhere.

785
01:13:11,443 --> 01:13:13,274
Anita.

786
01:13:38,670 --> 01:13:40,228
We got your message but
we cannot come today.

787
01:13:42,674 --> 01:13:43,140
Neeraj is fine.

788
01:13:49,714 --> 01:13:50,271
Anita.

789
01:14:15,907 --> 01:14:18,535
Neeraj what has happened to you?

790
01:14:19,844 --> 01:14:20,401
It is alright.

791
01:14:20,745 --> 01:14:22,576
You may go.

792
01:14:32,791 --> 01:14:35,589
Do you know what Menencorea is?

793
01:14:37,228 --> 01:14:39,389
It is a disease cause due
to sadness and depression.

794
01:14:40,832 --> 01:14:42,663
Though it does not have
any effect on the body.

795
01:14:42,834 --> 01:14:45,667
But it makes the person
very weak from within.

796
01:14:46,972 --> 01:14:48,940
This disease has only one cure.

797
01:14:50,875 --> 01:14:52,706
...you mind.

798
01:14:53,878 --> 01:14:55,038
Listen, Neeraj. Anita is dead.

799
01:14:55,347 --> 01:14:58,714
And you don it go searching
for dead people.

800
01:14:59,317 --> 01:15:00,750
Forget her.

801
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:04,718
Have these tablets.
You will feel sleepy.

802
01:15:05,924 --> 01:15:07,755
Good bye. - Thank you doctor.

803
01:15:10,962 --> 01:15:12,759
...your heart says.

804
01:15:14,966 --> 01:15:16,763
Tell.

805
01:15:17,969 --> 01:15:19,800
You will get alright
on your own.

806
01:15:22,007 --> 01:15:23,804
I have sent a letter to brother.

807
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:28,857
What will happen?

808
01:16:05,232 --> 01:16:07,063
Hello sister-in-law.
- Hello brother.

809
01:16:09,236 --> 01:16:12,103
There are so many turnings from
Cargodham to Nainital...

810
01:16:12,272 --> 01:16:13,830
...that I still feel
everything is moving.

811
01:16:14,474 --> 01:16:17,102
If you move about here for
some days then you will...

812
01:16:17,277 --> 01:16:19,108
...be alright.

813
01:16:25,118 --> 01:16:28,019
Sister-in-law you are
a great poetess.

814
01:16:28,321 --> 01:16:31,188
You have not heard
anything till now.

815
01:16:31,358 --> 01:16:31,824
Listen to her moppets? - Moppets?

816
01:16:32,559 --> 01:16:37,053
Not only moppets but moppers
of the beloved is feet.

817
01:16:37,364 --> 01:16:38,126
Great... wow. - Listen to this.

818
01:16:39,166 --> 01:16:46,129
The mopper of the beloved is feet...

819
01:16:47,407 --> 01:16:50,240
What does that mean?

820
01:16:50,444 --> 01:16:51,604
If you want to hear
it seriously hear it.

821
01:16:51,912 --> 01:16:52,901
Or else forget all these poems.

822
01:16:53,914 --> 01:16:56,041
I am very serious.
Please tell me.

823
01:16:56,249 --> 01:17:03,178
The mopper of the beloved is
feet was kept on the shelf.

824
01:17:05,492 --> 01:17:07,084
Neither did it reach... nor did I.

825
01:17:09,496 --> 01:17:12,363
But the news reached...

826
01:17:16,336 --> 01:17:21,239
Wow! Great! What has happened now?

827
01:17:21,575 --> 01:17:24,408
Is this a poem or a stone?

828
01:17:25,645 --> 01:17:30,275
No. Enough. Please
no more poems.

829
01:17:31,618 --> 01:17:33,779
The heart went with the
heartless beloved to her place.

830
01:17:34,087 --> 01:17:37,454
The heartless beloved
nudged it and it died.

831
01:17:39,426 --> 01:17:43,226
Once more. Did you see?
- I am getting so man y praises.

832
01:17:45,098 --> 01:17:46,497
I would say...

833
01:17:46,666 --> 01:17:51,535
The heart went to her place,
with the heartless beloved.

834
01:17:52,706 --> 01:17:56,142
The heartless beloved
nudged it and it died.

835
01:17:58,512 --> 01:18:03,472
If I do not get lunch in some time
I will go to with sang dil.

836
01:18:05,552 --> 01:18:07,918
Lunch box is with you.

837
01:18:10,190 --> 01:18:11,623
Start.

838
01:18:57,971 --> 01:19:00,132
Sister-in-law I will
get water from top.

839
01:19:25,899 --> 01:19:32,805
My friend where ever I see.

840
01:19:37,244 --> 01:19:43,012
I can see my lover
in front of me.

841
01:19:50,223 --> 01:19:53,784
My friend where ever I see.

842
01:20:06,273 --> 01:20:08,764
I can see my lover
in front of me.

843
01:20:32,866 --> 01:20:37,997
Love has made me a mendicant.

844
01:20:38,204 --> 01:20:44,143
Love has made me a mendicant.

845
01:20:48,148 --> 01:20:54,314
In the grief of love.

846
01:20:59,559 --> 01:21:04,087
Like the ripples in water.

847
01:21:04,197 --> 01:21:10,363
Like the ripples in water.

848
01:21:36,329 --> 01:21:41,198
I have beard all the pain
in my grief by crying.

849
01:21:41,768 --> 01:21:46,205
I have beard all the pain
in my grief by crying.

850
01:21:47,774 --> 01:21:53,406
I have been quite while
bearing all the pain.

851
01:21:57,717 --> 01:22:07,251
How do I say how the flute
was lost from his mouth?

852
01:22:08,595 --> 01:22:12,395
The flute from his mouth.

853
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:18,995
My friend where ever I see.

854
01:22:56,810 --> 01:23:02,612
The world is calling me crazy.

855
01:23:08,254 --> 01:23:11,417
No one can understand
loves language.

856
01:23:12,859 --> 01:23:14,451
My love, my love.

857
01:23:18,598 --> 01:23:27,996
My love, I have become crazy
searching you everywhere.

858
01:23:33,947 --> 01:23:37,542
My friend where ever I see.

859
01:23:38,985 --> 01:23:44,787
My friend where ever I see.

860
01:24:13,198 --> 01:24:13,789
Who are you?

861
01:24:19,137 --> 01:24:21,196
Your name?

862
01:24:21,940 --> 01:24:22,964
Mendicants don it have any name.

863
01:24:24,142 --> 01:24:27,634
But you?

864
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:31,011
What is the matter?

865
01:24:31,182 --> 01:24:36,279
The same voice, the
same face, the look.

866
01:24:38,189 --> 01:24:41,283
What look?
- Her look.

867
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:45,126
You look like her.

868
01:24:45,630 --> 01:24:45,925
Who?

869
01:24:48,366 --> 01:24:52,166
Anita.
- Anita?

870
01:24:52,270 --> 01:24:56,070
Where is she?
- She is no more in this world.

871
01:24:56,274 --> 01:24:59,072
But by seeing you I felt.

872
01:24:59,410 --> 01:24:59,967
I felt.

873
01:25:02,113 --> 01:25:06,209
Does my face look
like hers a lot?

874
01:25:06,451 --> 01:25:07,008
Not much.

875
01:25:09,153 --> 01:25:11,246
Exactly.

876
01:25:11,456 --> 01:25:16,257
The difference is only that
her eyes were black.

877
01:25:25,403 --> 01:25:27,234
Listen.

878
01:25:29,541 --> 01:25:30,098
Where do you stay?

879
01:25:31,843 --> 01:25:34,505
Mendicants do not
have a fixed place.

880
01:25:35,547 --> 01:25:37,139
Today they will be here.
Tomorrow they will be there.

881
01:25:41,286 --> 01:25:42,275
Can I meet you again?

882
01:25:42,487 --> 01:25:44,318
Me.
- Yes.

883
01:25:44,923 --> 01:25:46,185
Why do you want to meet me?

884
01:25:47,458 --> 01:25:52,555
Because your face looks
exactly like my Anita is.

885
01:25:52,630 --> 01:25:55,428
You are losing your peace.

886
01:25:56,668 --> 01:25:57,225
Forget her.

887
01:25:57,969 --> 01:25:59,231
Listen.

888
01:25:59,571 --> 01:26:04,372
You are a mendicant and
I am just a normal man.

889
01:26:05,543 --> 01:26:06,271
How will you know
what a heart is?

890
01:26:14,719 --> 01:26:15,310
It is time for the prayers.

891
01:26:18,756 --> 01:26:19,313
I want to meet you again.

892
01:26:21,059 --> 01:26:25,155
I might get some peace
by seeing you.

893
01:26:27,665 --> 01:26:30,498
Life does not continue through
somebody is support.

894
01:26:30,702 --> 01:26:32,533
It continues through somebody
else is support.

895
01:26:36,708 --> 01:26:38,539
Then too you want to meet me.

896
01:26:39,844 --> 01:26:40,401
Then you can meet me.

897
01:26:41,746 --> 01:26:43,577
I come here every day.

898
01:27:03,234 --> 01:27:05,668
Anita, if you would be alive
today and would have seen...

899
01:27:05,837 --> 01:27:10,672
...this mendicant you
would be surprised.

900
01:27:21,019 --> 01:27:23,817
Varsha, you are crying.

901
01:27:24,022 --> 01:27:24,613
Look at that.

902
01:27:30,815 --> 01:27:31,839
How much can someone
love somebody?

903
01:27:57,108 --> 01:28:00,600
Thank you very much
that you came here.

904
01:28:07,151 --> 01:28:08,846
It is such a strange place.

905
01:28:10,188 --> 01:28:11,849
It is so calm.

906
01:28:13,992 --> 01:28:14,890
Peace is not in the
outside world.

907
01:28:16,294 --> 01:28:16,885
It is within us.

908
01:28:17,195 --> 01:28:19,891
Yes. You are right.

909
01:28:24,335 --> 01:28:25,927
...keep going everywhere.

910
01:28:27,238 --> 01:28:28,933
As I was going everywhere.

911
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:30,935
Now have you stopped roaming?

912
01:28:31,275 --> 01:28:33,072
Yes.

913
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:39,078
I have found little brightness
in the dark.

914
01:28:40,318 --> 01:28:41,979
This is wrong.

915
01:28:43,421 --> 01:28:43,887
This brightness will take
you in more darkness.

916
01:28:45,323 --> 01:28:47,018
How?

917
01:28:51,362 --> 01:28:53,057
...the world.

918
01:28:54,365 --> 01:28:56,060
For someone who is dead.

919
01:28:57,502 --> 01:28:59,060
She is dead for the world
but she is alive for me.

920
01:28:59,370 --> 01:29:01,065
You are running behind
something which you will...

921
01:29:01,406 --> 01:29:04,204
...never get.

922
01:29:08,546 --> 01:29:09,103
I know it.

923
01:29:10,448 --> 01:29:13,246
But my love is not a ritual,
it is a penance, a sacrifice.

924
01:29:14,419 --> 01:29:16,819
And a penance is
never interrupted.

925
01:29:20,224 --> 01:29:23,193
What is your name?
- Neeraj.

926
01:29:25,596 --> 01:29:26,187
Nice name.

927
01:29:31,636 --> 01:29:32,193
Maya.

928
01:29:32,537 --> 01:29:34,232
Mendicant Maya.

929
01:30:56,988 --> 01:30:57,579
Why are you coming behind me?

930
01:31:01,125 --> 01:31:03,616
I also want to come with you.

931
01:31:03,995 --> 01:31:06,623
In your family.

932
01:31:08,132 --> 01:31:12,626
Do you think you will get peace
by coming in my family?

933
01:31:13,971 --> 01:31:16,565
But when you will come to
know about my distance.

934
01:31:17,975 --> 01:31:20,671
You will be hurt and fell sad.

935
01:31:22,013 --> 01:31:23,708
And due to it I will
also feel sad.

936
01:31:24,015 --> 01:31:26,813
Because I will be the
cause of your sadness.

937
01:31:31,255 --> 01:31:33,746
My world is over here.

938
01:31:35,059 --> 01:31:39,860
If I want I can come there.

939
01:31:40,498 --> 01:31:43,899
But you do not try to
cross this boundary.

940
01:32:15,233 --> 01:32:16,928
What are you thinking about?

941
01:32:17,235 --> 01:32:18,930
Neeraj has not yet come.

942
01:32:19,237 --> 01:32:20,932
I don it know what has
happened to him.

943
01:32:21,272 --> 01:32:22,933
He is behaving strangely.

944
01:32:23,674 --> 01:32:25,972
Varsh, I have a doubt.

945
01:32:27,278 --> 01:32:30,076
Has he again got lost
in Anita is thoughts?

946
01:32:50,368 --> 01:32:59,106
Ask my heart how my life
has been without you.

947
01:33:01,445 --> 01:33:05,245
Ask my heart.

948
01:33:11,522 --> 01:33:17,085
Ask my heart how my life
has been without you.

949
01:33:17,295 --> 01:33:20,093
Ask my heart.

950
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:26,092
Ask my heart.

951
01:33:28,739 --> 01:33:33,233
Ask my heart.

952
01:33:33,344 --> 01:33:37,178
Ask my heart.

953
01:33:51,662 --> 01:33:59,159
The monsoon have come and
brought along old memories.

954
01:34:03,107 --> 01:34:11,412
Who will make me sit
near them with?

955
01:34:13,751 --> 01:34:19,587
Ask my heart how lovely
and beautiful you were?

956
01:34:20,191 --> 01:34:22,455
Ask my heart.

957
01:34:23,994 --> 01:34:27,395
Ask my heart.

958
01:34:30,835 --> 01:34:35,534
Ask my heart how my life
has been without you.

959
01:34:40,611 --> 01:34:44,570
Ask my heart.

960
01:35:08,973 --> 01:35:17,711
The waves of sea of
love are everywhere.

961
01:35:20,017 --> 01:35:27,651
It goes on getting deeper
as I go in front.

962
01:35:29,126 --> 01:35:32,755
Ask my heart what all
has drowned in...

963
01:35:33,097 --> 01:35:35,793
...the flood of this sadness.

964
01:35:42,139 --> 01:35:44,835
Ask my heart.

965
01:35:46,343 --> 01:35:51,747
Ask my heart how my life
has been without you.

966
01:35:53,184 --> 01:35:55,880
Ask my heart.

967
01:35:56,287 --> 01:36:00,883
Ask my heart.

968
01:36:20,277 --> 01:36:29,015
You are shining like glow
worm in my tears.

969
01:36:29,820 --> 01:36:38,125
You have become a flower
and blossomed in some garden.

970
01:36:39,463 --> 01:36:47,097
Ask my heart I have
cried on my fortune.

971
01:36:51,609 --> 01:36:55,010
Ask my heart.

972
01:36:58,449 --> 01:37:03,148
Ask my heart how my life
has been without you.

973
01:37:31,383 --> 01:37:35,410
What is happening to you?

974
01:37:49,567 --> 01:37:52,468
It is of sacrifice.

975
01:38:08,052 --> 01:38:10,543
Come let is go.

976
01:38:35,647 --> 01:38:38,741
What is the matter Neeraj?
Why are you sitting here?

977
01:38:39,684 --> 01:38:43,677
Why didn it you come
home at night?

978
01:38:43,788 --> 01:38:44,379
What happened to you?

979
01:38:46,791 --> 01:38:47,382
She did not come.

980
01:38:51,729 --> 01:38:53,424
Who?

981
01:38:53,731 --> 01:38:56,529
Mendicant.
- Mendicant!

982
01:38:57,135 --> 01:39:00,434
Sister-in-law, she looks
exactly like Anita.

983
01:39:03,875 --> 01:39:07,745
The same face, the same look.

984
01:39:07,745 --> 01:39:08,473
She lives on that side
of the mountain.

985
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:10,604
Listen, Neeraj.

986
01:39:11,316 --> 01:39:12,476
We agree you have
met a mendicant.

987
01:39:12,817 --> 01:39:15,513
But you have considered
her as Anita.

988
01:39:15,820 --> 01:39:17,617
No.

989
01:39:17,956 --> 01:39:18,513
This time it is not my doubt.

990
01:39:19,858 --> 01:39:21,519
I met her.

991
01:39:22,961 --> 01:39:23,552
I saw her.

992
01:39:24,128 --> 01:39:25,561
I heard her song.
I spoke to her.

993
01:39:25,864 --> 01:39:27,559
Not ones but many times.

994
01:39:28,867 --> 01:39:30,562
No.

995
01:39:30,902 --> 01:39:32,563
I will not go unless I meet her.

996
01:39:32,904 --> 01:39:34,599
Ok. Where are we stopping you?

997
01:39:34,906 --> 01:39:37,602
Make us meet that mendicant
and we will agree.

998
01:39:40,044 --> 01:39:42,842
Or else you will have
to come home with us.

999
01:39:46,951 --> 01:39:49,647
Alright. Come with me.

1000
01:40:06,037 --> 01:40:09,734
Radhe Sham. Radhe Sham.
Radhe Sham.

1001
01:40:10,074 --> 01:40:11,735
Priest.

1002
01:40:13,177 --> 01:40:13,768
Where does that mendicant live?

1003
01:40:14,078 --> 01:40:16,774
Mendicant. Who mendicant?

1004
01:40:17,081 --> 01:40:18,776
The one who stays here.

1005
01:40:20,485 --> 01:40:23,010
No mendicant lives here.

1006
01:40:24,522 --> 01:40:24,817
Priest.

1007
01:40:26,124 --> 01:40:28,820
Her name is Maya.
- Maya.

1008
01:40:34,265 --> 01:40:34,856
Mendicant Maya.

1009
01:40:36,434 --> 01:40:38,959
What relation do you
have with her?

1010
01:40:42,206 --> 01:40:43,901
I want to meet her.

1011
01:40:44,208 --> 01:40:45,903
Come with me.

1012
01:41:01,793 --> 01:41:03,988
Radhe Sham. Radhe Sham.
Radhe Sham.

1013
01:41:05,697 --> 01:41:05,992
Look at this.

1014
01:41:25,383 --> 01:41:28,079
It has been twenty
years she is dead.

1015
01:42:03,655 --> 01:42:04,246
Malak you may go.

1016
01:42:08,559 --> 01:42:11,653
Did Neeraj meet any mendicant?

1017
01:42:12,697 --> 01:42:15,495
I think you have also
become crazy like him.

1018
01:42:19,437 --> 01:42:21,837
If it is doubt then tell me.

1019
01:42:22,707 --> 01:42:24,436
How can he know about a
mendicant who died twenty...

1020
01:42:24,742 --> 01:42:25,333
...years back?

1021
01:42:25,643 --> 01:42:29,443
He told that mendicant is
name, her looks.

1022
01:42:30,048 --> 01:42:30,343
How?

1023
01:42:31,683 --> 01:42:35,585
How do I say? I say is.

1024
01:42:35,687 --> 01:42:39,384
The mendicant who died thirty
years back has take a rebirth...

1025
01:42:39,691 --> 01:42:43,627
...in the form of Anita.

1026
01:42:44,729 --> 01:42:49,428
And the mendicant Neeraj
saw must have been Anita.

1027
01:42:52,770 --> 01:42:55,568
All this is due to rebirth.

1028
01:42:55,773 --> 01:42:58,571
I do not believe in rebirths.

1029
01:42:59,177 --> 01:43:00,474
Then what answer do you have
about that mendicant.

1030
01:43:01,079 --> 01:43:02,478
I do not know anything.

1031
01:43:03,648 --> 01:43:04,512
I only know that it is
not right for Neeraj...

1032
01:43:04,816 --> 01:43:06,511
...to stay here anymore.

1033
01:43:07,652 --> 01:43:08,516
I will send him back
to Bombay today.

1034
01:43:27,605 --> 01:43:28,594
I am sorry.

1035
01:44:08,212 --> 01:44:11,010
I don it have any
right to ask so.

1036
01:44:14,118 --> 01:44:16,814
I just want to know whether
it is you know no.

1037
01:44:23,161 --> 01:44:24,856
Don it get scared.

1038
01:44:25,429 --> 01:44:27,954
I don it want to trouble you.

1039
01:44:29,300 --> 01:44:29,766
I just want to know that you.

1040
01:44:32,203 --> 01:44:33,898
You cannot go.

1041
01:44:45,249 --> 01:44:48,343
You are standing alive
in front of me.

1042
01:44:49,086 --> 01:44:50,951
But the other day we found
your body in the water.

1043
01:44:52,290 --> 01:44:53,985
Then I saw you at the same
place where you committed...

1044
01:44:54,292 --> 01:44:56,089
...suicide.

1045
01:44:56,694 --> 01:44:57,991
But you went away.

1046
01:45:00,097 --> 01:45:02,122
I saw your footprints.

1047
01:45:06,604 --> 01:45:11,041
And I met you in the form
of mendicant Maya.

1048
01:45:12,877 --> 01:45:13,935
Mendicant Maya who was
dead twenty years back.

1049
01:45:16,781 --> 01:45:18,078
And today I am seeing
you in this new get up.

1050
01:45:19,684 --> 01:45:22,084
Tell me who are you?

1051
01:45:24,422 --> 01:45:26,481
Tell me.

1052
01:45:26,824 --> 01:45:27,119
Tell me who are you?

1053
01:45:28,559 --> 01:45:29,116
Who are you?

1054
01:45:37,768 --> 01:45:39,167
Don it try to find me.

1055
01:45:41,606 --> 01:45:44,200
I am neither of this
world nor of that.

1056
01:45:46,611 --> 01:45:49,011
I am neither alive nor dead.

1057
01:45:51,649 --> 01:45:55,244
If you are alive then
how do you go away?

1058
01:45:57,088 --> 01:46:00,251
And if you are dead then why
do you come in front of me.

1059
01:46:07,598 --> 01:46:11,295
Come I will tell you everything.

1060
01:47:23,140 --> 01:47:27,543
Mendicant, Anita, train,
gown impossible.

1061
01:47:29,246 --> 01:47:31,771
Whatever I told you
is absolutely right.

1062
01:47:33,985 --> 01:47:35,782
So what?

1063
01:47:36,087 --> 01:47:36,553
Can it any other girl
wear golden anklets?

1064
01:47:37,989 --> 01:47:39,388
She is tell me.

1065
01:47:39,690 --> 01:47:41,089
But she is Anita.

1066
01:47:47,031 --> 01:47:48,726
Anita had written a letter
to her father before...

1067
01:47:49,033 --> 01:47:51,866
...committing suicide.

1068
01:47:52,336 --> 01:47:54,861
Father, I am going.

1069
01:47:57,074 --> 01:47:59,770
I will never come back.
Never come back.

1070
01:48:00,077 --> 01:48:02,170
Your Anita.

1071
01:48:03,314 --> 01:48:05,976
This is the postmortem report.

1072
01:48:07,118 --> 01:48:08,813
It is clearly written
that Anita is body...

1073
01:48:09,120 --> 01:48:12,214
...was found on eight April.

1074
01:48:14,425 --> 01:48:17,952
It is proved by this that the
body must have been in the...

1075
01:48:18,262 --> 01:48:18,751
...water for nearly ten days.

1076
01:48:20,164 --> 01:48:22,860
From this letter and this
report it is proved that Anita has...

1077
01:48:23,200 --> 01:48:25,896
...committed suicide on
march twenty eight.

1078
01:48:27,204 --> 01:48:30,002
What did you say?
- March twenty eight.

1079
01:48:32,076 --> 01:48:32,906
This is the governments report.

1080
01:48:33,244 --> 01:48:36,042
There cannot be any
changes in it.

1081
01:48:41,318 --> 01:48:44,981
According to the postmortem
report Anita had committed...

1082
01:48:45,289 --> 01:48:46,984
...suicide on march twenty eight.

1083
01:48:47,291 --> 01:48:49,088
Correct.

1084
01:48:52,329 --> 01:48:53,990
How is this possible?

1085
01:48:57,334 --> 01:48:59,131
Wonderful.

1086
01:49:01,338 --> 01:49:03,101
...letter to Neeraj on
the second of April.

1087
01:49:03,407 --> 01:49:06,240
Inspector Sawant did you verify?

1088
01:49:07,845 --> 01:49:12,077
This is the report by
the handwriting expert.

1089
01:49:15,019 --> 01:49:20,116
Gentlemen we have got four
points in front of us.

1090
01:49:22,460 --> 01:49:25,258
A) Anita is alive.

1091
01:49:25,463 --> 01:49:27,624
B) She knows whose body that is.

1092
01:49:30,468 --> 01:49:31,230
C) That is why she is not there.

1093
01:49:32,703 --> 01:49:39,108
D) We are not investigating
a suicide case.

1094
01:49:40,511 --> 01:49:42,206
But a murder case.

1095
01:49:44,548 --> 01:49:47,244
And Anita is involved
in this murder.

1096
01:49:47,351 --> 01:49:51,253
And Anita had written in this
letter that her life and self...

1097
01:49:51,555 --> 01:49:53,250
...respect is in danger.

1098
01:49:53,357 --> 01:49:57,293
I think she will again
try to meet Neeraj.

1099
01:49:57,661 --> 01:50:00,289
Inspector Sawant keep a
watch on Neeraj's house...

1100
01:50:00,598 --> 01:50:01,360
...for twenty four hours.

1101
01:50:01,665 --> 01:50:04,293
Ok sir.

1102
01:50:16,680 --> 01:50:18,375
You know that I am alive.

1103
01:50:18,682 --> 01:50:20,377
I also want to meet you.

1104
01:50:20,684 --> 01:50:22,879
Ten o clock in the evening
at La Bella restaurant.

1105
01:50:23,320 --> 01:50:26,414
If anyone comes along with
you then I will not come...

1106
01:50:26,724 --> 01:50:28,419
...in front of you.

1107
01:50:29,026 --> 01:50:30,425
Anita.

1108
01:51:00,191 --> 01:51:02,557
Yes I have done all
the arrangements.

1109
01:51:02,893 --> 01:51:04,554
Ok. Then listen carefully.

1110
01:52:10,227 --> 01:52:19,101
It is eyes" hint to be careful.

1111
01:52:20,704 --> 01:52:28,702
It is eyes" hint to get careful.

1112
01:52:31,248 --> 01:52:32,943
Go away.

1113
01:52:33,550 --> 01:52:37,748
Don it come in the
matters of the heart.

1114
01:52:40,291 --> 01:52:49,029
It is eyes" hint to get careful.

1115
01:52:50,334 --> 01:52:59,072
It is eyes" hint to get careful.

1116
01:53:09,219 --> 01:53:14,122
Or else it will be
the same thing.

1117
01:53:15,459 --> 01:53:19,156
You will meet me.

1118
01:53:23,267 --> 01:53:28,204
It is day but it will
seem as night.

1119
01:53:36,313 --> 01:53:46,154
It is eyes" hint to get careful.

1120
01:54:19,390 --> 01:54:25,420
It will be difficult to live.

1121
01:54:39,009 --> 01:54:47,417
Get up from the get
together and go.

1122
01:54:47,918 --> 01:54:57,589
It is eyes" hint to get careful.

1123
01:55:23,687 --> 01:55:27,384
Extinguish this fire.

1124
01:55:28,826 --> 01:55:33,627
Don it increase the flames.

1125
01:55:33,831 --> 01:55:36,425
Extinguish this fire.

1126
01:55:37,734 --> 01:55:41,431
Extinguish it for me to come.

1127
01:55:41,772 --> 01:55:49,474
Don it let the eyes meet.

1128
01:56:11,047 --> 01:56:11,604
She will not come here now.

1129
01:56:12,949 --> 01:56:14,644
I also think so.

1130
01:56:35,138 --> 01:56:35,729
You!

1131
01:56:38,040 --> 01:56:39,735
Yes.

1132
01:56:41,177 --> 01:56:41,734
Why didn it you come there?

1133
01:56:43,179 --> 01:56:43,736
I could not come.

1134
01:56:44,347 --> 01:56:45,780
There was danger.

1135
01:56:46,082 --> 01:56:48,175
Danger.

1136
01:56:53,823 --> 01:56:56,314
I cannot tell you anything.

1137
01:56:59,128 --> 01:57:00,823
...stay here. You
go back to Delhi.

1138
01:57:02,265 --> 01:57:04,358
For me. For the sake of my love.

1139
01:57:07,436 --> 01:57:08,869
Don it ask me anything.

1140
01:57:10,173 --> 01:57:11,868
Don it ask me anything.

1141
01:57:13,309 --> 01:57:14,901
So much has happened and then
also don it ask anything.

1142
01:57:18,214 --> 01:57:22,913
Neeraj, I know you have
suffered a lot due to me.

1143
01:57:24,253 --> 01:57:25,948
But forgive me.

1144
01:57:27,356 --> 01:57:27,947
Listen to me.

1145
01:57:28,257 --> 01:57:29,952
You go back to Delhi.

1146
01:57:32,128 --> 01:57:34,494
I am not capable for your love.

1147
01:57:36,399 --> 01:57:39,232
Forget me.
- But why?

1148
01:57:39,435 --> 01:57:40,993
Anita. Nothing is
wrong till now.

1149
01:57:41,337 --> 01:57:43,134
Tell me the truth.

1150
01:57:43,873 --> 01:57:45,033
If you are alive then
whose body was that?

1151
01:57:50,179 --> 01:57:51,043
But the police does
know everything.

1152
01:57:53,382 --> 01:57:56,180
...unknown girl.

1153
01:57:57,486 --> 01:58:02,082
This is also doubted that Anita
has killed that unknown girl.

1154
01:58:02,425 --> 01:58:05,485
You have done it. - No, no.
- I have not done anything.

1155
01:58:05,828 --> 01:58:06,123
I am innocent.

1156
01:58:26,515 --> 01:58:28,210
Hello.
- Hello.

1157
01:58:29,518 --> 01:58:31,213
Inspector Sawant.
- Speaking.

1158
01:58:31,554 --> 01:58:34,352
Neeraj.
- Anita.

1159
01:58:34,557 --> 01:58:38,926
If you tell anything to
the police about me then.

1160
01:58:39,562 --> 01:58:41,257
Then the pistol will start.

1161
01:58:45,534 --> 01:58:46,398
I will kill myself.

1162
01:58:46,602 --> 01:58:48,297
Anita.

1163
01:58:59,448 --> 01:59:00,346
Neeraj, believe me.

1164
01:59:00,650 --> 01:59:04,586
I am innocent. Absolutely
innocent.

1165
01:59:05,054 --> 01:59:06,885
Anita then why do you want
to hide everything...

1166
01:59:07,223 --> 01:59:09,623
...from the police.

1167
01:59:10,693 --> 01:59:13,526
Till when will you
change your get up?

1168
01:59:14,096 --> 01:59:15,427
Till when will this
gown hide you?

1169
01:59:24,874 --> 01:59:25,465
SP sir. SP sir.

1170
01:59:26,042 --> 01:59:27,475
Anita is at Neeraj is
house right now.

1171
01:59:27,777 --> 01:59:29,870
Really. - Yes.

1172
01:59:30,179 --> 01:59:32,010
She is in a gown. We can
arrest her right now.

1173
01:59:35,918 --> 01:59:37,510
You tell the people
on duty to be alert.

1174
01:59:38,654 --> 01:59:40,519
When the person in gown come
from there to follow her.

1175
01:59:40,823 --> 01:59:42,518
I will also contact the control.

1176
01:59:42,858 --> 01:59:45,554
Ok sir.
- Hello. Hello. Control.

1177
01:59:45,861 --> 01:59:48,557
Instruct all the officers on
the P division to check all the...

1178
01:59:48,864 --> 01:59:50,661
...highways.

1179
01:59:51,267 --> 01:59:53,098
And also to make all the
other divisions alert.

1180
01:59:53,402 --> 01:59:55,700
First one car should
follow her car.

1181
01:59:56,005 --> 01:59:59,406
Then the car behind it will
relieve the second one.

1182
01:59:59,909 --> 02:00:01,604
...she is been followed.

1183
02:00:01,944 --> 02:00:04,640
If Anita does not have a doubt
that we are following her...

1184
02:00:04,947 --> 02:00:08,439
...we will come to know
where she stays.

1185
02:00:10,953 --> 02:00:12,648
Control calling Peter.

1186
02:00:15,524 --> 02:00:16,786
Peter.
- Peter speaking.

1187
02:00:17,093 --> 02:00:17,684
A lady in a gown will come
from Neeraj is house.

1188
02:00:17,994 --> 02:00:19,689
You follow her.

1189
02:00:19,996 --> 02:00:21,793
But she should not
come to know that...

1190
02:00:22,131 --> 02:00:22,688
...you are following her.

1191
02:00:23,032 --> 02:00:24,727
Ok sir.

1192
02:00:48,224 --> 02:00:48,815

1193
02:02:18,514 --> 02:02:20,209

02:02:22,551 --> 02:02:24,610
Peter speaking.

1195
02:02:24,920 --> 02:02:25,249
Now you stop following her.

1196
02:02:25,554 --> 02:02:27,249
Jeff will take over from front.

1197
02:02:30,259 --> 02:02:31,248
Park the car.

1198
02:02:40,603 --> 02:02:42,400
Jeff calling control.

1199
02:02:42,738 --> 02:02:43,295
The white car is going
in front of me.

1200
02:02:43,639 --> 02:02:46,437
I am following it. Over.

1201
02:03:00,689 --> 02:03:03,783
Alpha calling control.
Alpha calling control.

1202
02:03:04,093 --> 02:03:05,424
The whit car is coming
and I am following it.

1203
02:03:12,868 --> 02:03:13,425
Over.

1204
02:03:41,363 --> 02:03:44,696
The car is going towards
the highway.

1205
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:45,591
You keep watching it.

1206
02:03:46,902 --> 02:03:48,597
Ok sir.

1207
02:03:58,214 --> 02:04:00,045
The car has taken speed.

1208
02:04:01,951 --> 02:04:03,646
You arrest her.

1209
02:04:03,986 --> 02:04:05,783
Sorry sir.

1210
02:04:06,455 --> 02:04:09,788
You are being sent help.

1211
02:04:09,992 --> 02:04:11,789
Ok sir.

1212
02:04:12,127 --> 02:04:12,684
Fast, fast.

1213
02:04:20,035 --> 02:04:21,832
A little fast.

1214
02:04:22,171 --> 02:04:22,728
Sir I have pressed the
entire escalator.

1215
02:04:23,072 --> 02:04:24,869
Fast.

1216
02:04:25,174 --> 02:04:25,765
Yes sir.

1217
02:06:56,725 --> 02:06:59,421
Stop. Stop. Stop the car.

1218
02:09:00,749 --> 02:09:03,946
Radhe Sham.

1219
02:09:05,354 --> 02:09:08,323
Radhe Sham. Radhe Sham.

1220
02:09:08,490 --> 02:09:09,889
Neeraj.

1221
02:09:11,293 --> 02:09:12,783
The secret behind which you
were so worried, now is the...

1222
02:09:13,095 --> 02:09:17,031
...time for you to know it.

1223
02:09:22,337 --> 02:09:23,099
...secret.

1224
02:09:25,374 --> 02:09:28,537
Because if you are alive I
will be hanged to death.

1225
02:09:28,877 --> 02:09:32,540
Now you will be told
Anita is real story.

1226
02:09:34,416 --> 02:09:39,115
So that you will have no doubts
before you r death.

1227
02:09:55,504 --> 02:09:56,971
Every person is story starts
with some other person.

1228
02:09:57,706 --> 02:10:01,369
This story starts with Anita.

1229
02:10:04,546 --> 02:10:05,012
I was going to get
married to Anita.

1230
02:10:07,549 --> 02:10:09,244
But there was an interruption
in it.

1231
02:10:12,354 --> 02:10:15,255
And you are responsible for it.

1232
02:10:18,093 --> 02:10:20,493
Why are you calling
your death Bela?

1233
02:10:21,096 --> 02:10:23,189
Don it try to come in my way.

1234
02:10:24,633 --> 02:10:26,294
You know me very well.

1235
02:10:26,635 --> 02:10:28,330
Very well.

1236
02:10:35,444 --> 02:10:38,379
What will happen?

1237
02:10:38,680 --> 02:10:40,147
When Anita will come to know
you are an international...

1238
02:10:40,482 --> 02:10:44,543
...smuggler and are wanted
by the police.

1239
02:11:27,562 --> 02:11:32,590
Now I was going to
be hanged to death.

1240
02:11:41,743 --> 02:11:45,804
And to make that girls
body as Anita is body.

1241
02:11:51,787 --> 02:11:54,585
...come on top for ten days.

1242
02:12:05,534 --> 02:12:07,434
Then sir recognized the
body as Anita is body.

1243
02:12:07,736 --> 02:12:09,431
Through which everybody
believed that Anita committed...

1244
02:12:09,738 --> 02:12:11,433
...suicide.

1245
02:12:14,776 --> 02:12:19,475
Now I was just wanting for
the news to become calm.

1246
02:12:20,615 --> 02:12:23,015
Then I will send the daughter
and father to another...

1247
02:12:23,318 --> 02:12:25,718
...country with a different
identity.

1248
02:12:28,623 --> 02:12:29,521
I had done everything properly.

1249
02:12:30,659 --> 02:12:34,618
But I could not realize
your love.

1250
02:12:37,966 --> 02:12:39,558
I sent you to that painter
who was my worker.

1251
02:12:40,168 --> 02:12:41,567
Who told you another false
story about Anita being...

1252
02:12:41,903 --> 02:12:43,564
...a bad girl.

1253
02:12:46,007 --> 02:12:48,703
Anita is one letter and your
investigation made my entire...

1254
02:12:49,044 --> 02:12:51,842
...plan a failure.

1255
02:12:57,953 --> 02:12:59,750
I have done all the
arrangements...

1256
02:13:00,088 --> 02:13:00,645
...to escape from here.

1257
02:13:11,433 --> 02:13:15,836
Father you supported a murderer.

1258
02:13:16,037 --> 02:13:17,732
I didn it have any other option.

1259
02:13:19,341 --> 02:13:24,142
After that murder
Anil came to me.

1260
02:13:35,490 --> 02:13:35,819
What have you considered me?

1261
02:13:36,958 --> 02:13:39,825
I cannot do such injustice
to my daughter.

1262
02:13:40,428 --> 02:13:43,829
I cannot ruin my daughter is
life to save your life.

1263
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:45,864
Be conscious sir.

1264
02:13:46,434 --> 02:13:47,867
Don it forget you are my partner
in smuggling and...

1265
02:13:48,170 --> 02:13:49,865
...many other crimes.

1266
02:13:50,172 --> 02:13:52,265
Yes I am a smuggler.

1267
02:13:52,574 --> 02:13:53,871
I am your partner in many
crimes but I am not a bad...

1268
02:13:54,209 --> 02:13:56,700
...father.

1269
02:14:03,752 --> 02:14:04,946
Or else I will be hanged to
death and this is the only...

1270
02:14:05,253 --> 02:14:08,745
...way I will be saved.

1271
02:14:10,258 --> 02:14:12,055
Listen to me.

1272
02:14:12,661 --> 02:14:12,956
Or else I will kill her.

1273
02:14:13,295 --> 02:14:15,092
I will kill her.

1274
02:14:15,397 --> 02:14:15,988
I will kill her.
I will kill her.

1275
02:14:16,298 --> 02:14:18,095
Anil.

1276
02:14:18,700 --> 02:14:18,995
Anita.

1277
02:14:25,340 --> 02:14:27,035
I was compelled.

1278
02:14:29,477 --> 02:14:30,034
Then why didn it you tell me?

1279
02:14:32,380 --> 02:14:34,177
If I would tell you.

1280
02:14:34,916 --> 02:14:36,076
You would never listen to me
even after knowing everything.

1281
02:14:37,219 --> 02:14:40,620
That is why I lied that
my life is in danger.

1282
02:14:40,922 --> 02:14:44,085
If you want me to be alive to
continue doing what I say.

1283
02:14:45,527 --> 02:14:49,327
And you listened to me.

1284
02:14:50,432 --> 02:14:52,127
That is why you were
sent to Nainital.

1285
02:14:53,301 --> 02:14:54,131
You became a mendicant.

1286
02:14:54,469 --> 02:14:59,168
You put a blue lens and tried
to hide yourself from the world.

1287
02:14:59,474 --> 02:15:02,170
You changed many get ups
and took different looks.

1288
02:15:02,777 --> 02:15:04,301
And today.

1289
02:15:04,613 --> 02:15:07,411
And today you all
will be killed.

1290
02:15:11,486 --> 02:15:12,214
Far away from this country.

1291
02:15:12,554 --> 02:15:14,351
Very far.

1292
02:15:15,657 --> 02:15:18,455
Anil Sharma. Anil Sharma.

1293
02:15:18,560 --> 02:15:22,360
You are being arrested for
murdering an unknown girl.

1294
02:15:30,005 --> 02:15:32,098
The police have surrounded
the entire bungalow.

1295
02:15:32,641 --> 02:15:34,302
Surrender yourself to the law.

1296
02:16:01,870 --> 02:16:04,668
I will give you two
minute to come out.

1297
02:16:20,655 --> 02:16:22,520
I have got three
innocent people.

1298
02:16:22,857 --> 02:16:28,557
Anita, Biharilala and Neeraj.

1299
02:16:29,864 --> 02:16:34,699
If anyone tries to come
in I will kill them.

1300
02:16:41,710 --> 02:16:45,840
Anil Sharma you already have
the blame of killing a girl.

1301
02:16:47,949 --> 02:16:51,316
...saved by being hanged.

1302
02:16:52,787 --> 02:16:54,652
You can hang me just once.

1303
02:16:57,092 --> 02:17:00,926
ACP I will arrest him just now.

1304
02:17:02,130 --> 02:17:04,928
He is desperate by seeing
so much of force.

1305
02:17:11,439 --> 02:17:14,533
Anil Sharma you have
one minute left.

1306
02:17:15,010 --> 02:17:15,772
Surrender yourself
to the police.

1307
02:17:16,077 --> 02:17:17,772
Or else action will be taken.

1308
02:17:22,083 --> 02:17:24,574
Come sir.
- Anil.

1309
02:17:25,120 --> 02:17:26,815
Anil.

1310
02:17:40,468 --> 02:17:41,867
Tear gas.

1311
02:17:46,207 --> 02:17:47,902
Throw.

1312
02:18:18,740 --> 02:18:21,038
SP sir this is the answer
to your actions.

1313
02:18:21,342 --> 02:18:24,175
