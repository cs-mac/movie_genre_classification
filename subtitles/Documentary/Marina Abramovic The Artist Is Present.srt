1
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,372
Target bearing 0-2-0.

2
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:24,084
Contact 0-2-0.

00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:27,129
- Range 20,000.
- Range 20,000 yards.

00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:30,090

- Speed 1 3 knots.

6
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:36,889
Cowboys.

7
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,797
Sail Team 1, man the sixties.

8
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,498
"Enchanter, Mobile".

9
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,586
Well, we're a long way from home.
Wake them up!

10
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,178
What is that?

11
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:19,324
Enchanter!
This is the U.S. Coast Guard!

12
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:23,120
Heave to
and prepare to be boarded!

13
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:41,513
Enchanter! You are a U.S. flag ship,
and we are going to board you.

14
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,223
Heave to now!

15
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,654
Getyour crew on the bow.

16
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:28,143
- What do you want?
- Kneel down.

17
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,525
Captain... Captain!

18
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,570
Go ahead, Senior Chief.

19
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:42,407
It's a bad one. I think you'd better
send over the video camera.

20
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,471
Jack, come on in.

21
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:10,644
- How high is the pile on your desk?
- About this high.

22
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,563
Now it's this high.

23
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:16,817
You heard about that business in the
south Caribbean? I need the details.

24
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,113
- By when?
- As soon as you can.

25
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:24,491
Jack? Be discreet.

26
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,454
What do you mean?

27
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:31,415
You'll find out.

28
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,294
Mysterious...

29
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,506
I love a mystery.

30
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,263
- Ryan, John P.
- Let him through.

31
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,685
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

32
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:54,855
- You know where you're going?
- Yes. Thank you.

33
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,609
- Oh, where do I park?
- Right over there.

34
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:13,248
..main passageway
going forward...

35
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,667
...master stateroom...
blood on the deck...

36
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:18,128
1 9 cartridges were recovered...

37
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,800
...as well as the two weapons
that fired them.

38
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:29,556
The blood samples taken were
consistent with the crew, Hardin...

39
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,604
...and his wife
and his son and daughter.

40
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,151
...blood on sheets and pill s...

41
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:44,613
...on both starboard
and portside racks...

42
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:49,451
They were killed in their staterooms
apparently as they slept.

43
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:53,413
Dragged topside
and thrown overboard.

44
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:59,670
The two men in custody surrendered
after a brief attempt to escape.

45
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:02,881
What do we know about them?
The men in custody?

46
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,680
HaIf a dozen arrests for drug
trafficking in Bogota, Mr President.

47
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,140
Drugs.

48
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,771
Suspected ties to the Cali cartel,
not Medellin...

49
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,858
- You all right, James?
- ...according to DEA.

50
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:24,111
- Why?
- Nothing exotic, sir.

51
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:28,073
Straight piracy and murder.
It's not the first time.

52
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:32,744
It's the first time
it was a friend of mine.

53
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,248
Yes, sir.

54
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,592
- What was that? You all right?
- Yeah.

55
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,803
I haven't slept in 36 hours.
Did I make any sense?

56
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,681
What did you say?
Just kidding. Good job.

57
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:59,980
- You should give diplomacy lessons.
- To call it as I see it is my job.

58
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:04,276
- And he's yours.
- Wait for me.

59
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,490
Shut the door.

60
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:18,916
I promised the American people I'd
do something about the drug problem.

61
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,251
You are.

62
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:25,380
We support the Colombians' efforts
against the cartels...

63
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,011
We've accomplished nothing. Do these
drug dealers think we're powerless?

64
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:36,099
That they can keep doing this kind of
thing, and there's no response ever?

65
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,813
Are you suggesting
a course of action, sir?

66
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:46,944
The course of action I'd suggest is
a course of action I can't suggest.

67
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:06,547
I'm...not sure
where that leaves us.

68
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:14,429
These drug cartels represent
a clear and present danger -

69
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:59,117
Come after me? Arrest me?

70
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:01,828
You're scaring me.

71
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:07,835
Will you stop long enough for me
to tell you something important?

72
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,548
Thank you.

73
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:19,763
Listen... You pay me to counsel you,
and I am counselling you.

74
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,810
I'm keeping you alive
with information.

75
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:30,148
If you disregard my counsel and keep
running your business like this, -

76
00:11:31,984 --> 00:11:35,654
- with your balls and not your head,
two things will happen.

77
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:39,491
I'll quit, and you'll get killed.

78
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:55,174
You forgot to tell me
about your scouting trip.

79
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:59,219
- No, I didn't.
- You made another contact. Who?

80
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,891
Castro always asked me
about my sources.

81
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:08,228
- I always gave him the same answer.
- Castro didn't pay you what I pay.

82
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,482
This one will cost you nothing.

83
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:16,486
A woman.

84
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:19,031
You're using a woman.

85
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:32,002
- John, what do you want? Toast?
- Waffles!

86
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:35,172
- No time for waffles.
- Anybody seen my keys?

87
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:39,009
On the front hall table
or in your pocket.

88
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,595
- Where are my keys?
- Pancakes!

89
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,473
- Toast, please!
- Thank you.

90
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,477
- Bye, pal.
- lt won't float!

91
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:53,023
It's not supposed to float,
it's a submarine. lt goes under water.

92
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,446
Hello?

93
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:03,408
When?

94
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:07,204
I thought I had the flu.

95
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,583
I'd stilI think so if they weren't
telling me otherwise.

96
00:13:14,086 --> 00:13:16,338
What are they telling you?

97
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:22,010
Pancreatic cancer of an aggressive
nature, if I heard them right.

98
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,265
Well, what does it mean?

99
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,769
I guess it means I'm in big trouble.

100
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:34,064
- I mean, can they operate, or..?
- Maybe.

101
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:40,529
That's what they said, "maybe", which
sounds suspiciously like "no" to me.

102
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:43,240
There's one of them now.

103
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:48,162
Hey, I'm not dead yet.

104
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:53,792
I am in a hospital, which means
that I'm not in my office, -

105
00:13:56,128 --> 00:13:59,131
- which means
I don't know what's going on.

106
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:01,175
- I need you there.
- Where?

107
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:04,344
- In my office, doing my job.
- Wait a minute...

108
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:08,432
I hate not knowing
what's going on, you know that.

109
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:12,019
I wouldn't know
how to do your job, sir.

110
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:15,480
You've been around.
You've been to the White House.

111
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:19,860
- Once. I hated it.
- No, you didn't.

112
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:25,657
Want to know about politics
in Washington? Four words...

113
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:28,368
"Watch your back, Jack."

114
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:37,044
Bobby, you should be the first
to know, or the third or fourth...

115
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:42,216
Ryan is to be acting
Deputy Director of lntelligence.

116
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:46,303
lt will be a provisional appointment,
of course, until James recovers.

117
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:51,350
You brief him
on our aid programme to Colombia.

118
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:56,355
He must talk the oversight committee
out of another 75 million dollars.

119
00:14:57,231 --> 00:15:00,192
And not make a complete fool
out of himself.

120
00:15:02,194 --> 00:15:04,571
What about the Hardin murders?

121
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:08,784
I'm on it. The President's calling
for a full-court press.

122
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:12,830
So, you guys are going to be
working together hand in hand.

123
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:16,875
That's great.

124
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:35,269
Margaret, why don't we
leave all his things?

125
00:15:50,242 --> 00:15:52,452
Ryan. I can't believe it !

126
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:56,540
He's not a team player,
is that what you're saying?

127
00:15:57,249 --> 00:15:59,084
He's a Boy Scout.

128
00:16:00,252 --> 00:16:04,381
A god-damn Boy Scout. Believes in
loyalty, cleanliness and knot-tying.

129
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,302
So leave him out of it.

130
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:12,055
He's the Deputy Director of
lntelligence. That will be tricky.

131
00:16:12,306 --> 00:16:14,516
What does he need to know?

132
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:19,062
Nothing. He needs to know nothing.
He's going to know nothing.

133
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:25,277
I want a copy
of the President's authorisation -

134
00:16:25,277 --> 00:16:28,155
- of this new action
against the cartels.

135
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:31,783
- You want what?
- You heard me.

136
00:16:34,286 --> 00:16:36,455
He doesn't know about it.

137
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:41,210
Let me explain it to you very simply.
This is your deal. Not mine.

138
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:48,550
Unless I have written authorisation,
this thing is over before it begins.

139
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:53,639
I'm not going to be the only one left
without a chair when the music stops.

140
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:37,432
"Reciprocity".
That's a clever name for it.

141
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:41,687
Revenge is a very, very,
very dangerous motivation.

142
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:48,610
Are you able to handle this operation
or not? I'm looking for a yes or no.

143
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:52,990
You're looking for a political mess.

144
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:56,118
- Yes or no?
- ls that what they want?

145
00:17:56,368 --> 00:18:00,372
They want what every first term
administration wants. A second term.

146
00:18:02,374 --> 00:18:05,878
I don't imagine the boys on the Hill
have approved this.

147
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:08,255
The bill, please!

148
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:12,968
Have they?

149
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:17,264
ls that a "no"?

150
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:24,771
Shit.

151
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,776
I want the money in my account
before I move an inch.

152
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:34,156
- You got it.
- I need a Com Sat link.

153
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:38,494
- An insertion team.
- You can have a brigade.

154
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:43,207
Just 1 2 men who understand
discretionary warfare. Special Ops.

155
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:55,469
- How are you today, sir?
- Very well.

156
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:58,305
- The purpose of your visit?
- Business.

157
00:18:59,473 --> 00:19:02,476
- What business are you in?
- I sell tractors.

158
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:05,145
Well, I build them, then I sell them.

159
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:08,690
- And how long will you be staying?
- A few days.

160
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:40,639
I know it's a risk,
but what's the alternative?

161
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:45,394
Zapping a retina with 6,000 rads
of cobalt? Not a pretty picture.

162
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,523
Prettier than a tumour
spreading in the cranial sack.

163
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:51,358
What is her name?

164
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:55,320
Listen... Hungry?

165
00:19:57,489 --> 00:20:00,367
- Starved.
- We could forget about lunch.

166
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:05,122
- We did that last time, remember?
- Do I remember? Do you?

167
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,670
- Vaguely.
- Maybe I should refresh your memory.

168
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:17,551
- Maybe you should.
- Your table is ready now.

169
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:20,554
- We don't need it. I'll get a cab.
- Moira?

170
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:24,057
- Hi! How are you? How's Jack?
- He's great, just great.

171
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,563
- You still with the FBl?
- The Director's office.

172
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:32,065
- Who was that?
- My new friend.

173
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:34,526
Senor Roberto Landa.

174
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:39,114
- Doesn't he look like Jack?
- Does he? I can't quite see.

175
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:42,743
- Only Latin.
- A Latin Jack? This I have to see.

176
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:47,414
I have to go. Bye.

177
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:52,836
Well, we know it's not piracy.
Pirates steal boats.

178
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:58,425
They had plane tickets to Bogota
the morning after the killings.

179
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:01,595
- Hey, Dan.
- How's it going?

180
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:04,598
We're sneaking up on a motive.
Dan Murray, FBl.

181
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:07,559
- Ralph Williams, DEA.
- Said anything yet?

182
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:11,396
- Yeah, "we're innocent".
- Till the D.A. offers them a deal.

183
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:15,442
He already has.
Regular or extra crispy?

184
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:19,071
Either referring to fried chicken
or the electric chair.

185
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:22,574
Are you picturing a hit?

186
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:25,953
On a respectable American
businessman and his family?

187
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:30,082
You're assuming he's respectable.

188
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:41,844
We have memos,
letters, credit card statements...

189
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:48,225
...phone bills, anything
you could need to break his code.

190
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:53,564
- What's this?
- Old high school yearbook.

191
00:21:53,647 --> 00:21:56,650
- Sweethearts, football team...
- You think?

192
00:21:57,609 --> 00:22:00,737
- I don't know.
- OK, let's see what we've got.

193
00:22:02,614 --> 00:22:05,075
- No cream?
- There wasn't any.

194
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:09,413
Let's start with birthdays.
Bet your ATM code is your birthday.

195
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:11,707
- Close.
- In reverse?

196
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:16,962
All right, his birthday is...

197
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:22,134
That would be too easy, wouldn't it?
Try it in reverse.

198
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:25,429
No. His wife's?

199
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:29,391
No. His son's?

200
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:31,685
- This could take...
- Months.

201
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:34,271
Son's in reverse.
This is for you.

202
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,734
No. Wife's in reverse.

203
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:41,653
No. Daughter's in reverse.

204
00:22:41,653 --> 00:22:44,239
You've got to change your ATM code.

205
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:56,168
I got it!

206
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,848
Wife's birth month,
daughter's day, son's year.

207
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:12,935
But not in reverse. Sorry.

208
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:23,153
Print me out that one, will you?

209
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:26,198
Good boy.

210
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:30,702
Three years ago Hardin received
a large infusion of foreign money, -

211
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:35,374
- which he invested in 20 major
shopping centres in the U.S.

212
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:40,212
In the middle of the recession
he posted record profits.

213
00:23:41,755 --> 00:23:45,509
At least to the lRS, who he feared
more than his own partners.

214
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,222
According to the stockholder
statements he gave them, -

215
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:53,767
- the shopping centres
weren't doing so well.

216
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:57,771
But he was just skimming most of
the profits, 650 million dollars, -

217
00:23:58,772 --> 00:24:02,109
- and putting it in accounts
in Luxembourg, Panama -

218
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:05,946
- and the Cayman lslands.
They killed him for it.

219
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:09,032
Who?

220
00:24:09,741 --> 00:24:12,578
- His partners.
- Who were his partners?

221
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:17,040
lt seems clear that he was laundering
money for the Colombian drug cartels.

222
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:23,672
Jesus... I knew the man for 40 years.
We went to school together.

223
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,553
We almost went
into business together.

224
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:32,014
That would have been good.

225
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:36,810
The press is going to
have a field-day with this.

226
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:40,564
- No one outside this room knows.
- They will. They always do.

227
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:45,777
lt will come up, you're right
about that. And when it does, we'll...

228
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:50,032
...downplay your relationship
with Hardin somehow.

229
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:55,579
- What?
- What?

230
00:24:55,787 --> 00:24:58,499
- We'll defuse it.
- Do you disagree?

231
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:00,792
No.

232
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:04,254
Well, actually, yes.
I would go in the other direction.

233
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:11,220
If a reporter asked if you and Hardin
were friends, I'd say "good friends".

234
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:15,891
If they asked if you were good
friends, I'd say "lifelong friends".

235
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:20,270
Give them no place to go,
nothing to report. No story.

236
00:25:24,858 --> 00:25:28,570
I mean, it's no sense in
defusing a bomb after it's already...

237
00:25:30,822 --> 00:25:32,991
...it's already gone off.

238
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:01,645
Do you see him?

239
00:26:01,895 --> 00:26:05,107
All right. Move your team
two metres to the left.

240
00:26:09,862 --> 00:26:11,655
That's it. Stop.

241
00:26:12,865 --> 00:26:16,243
Touch that light-coloured grass.
Sniper at your feet.

242
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:19,872
Nothing here, Sergeant Major.

243
00:26:19,872 --> 00:26:21,915
- Damn!
- He is good.

244
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:42,769
That was close.
How's he moving so fast?

245
00:26:48,942 --> 00:26:51,820
I see him. Come in.
Straight in. Now. Run!

246
00:26:53,906 --> 00:26:55,532
Keep coming.

247
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:00,162
To your left, To your left,

248
00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:06,251
And stop. Sniper atyour feet,

249
00:27:08,921 --> 00:27:10,589
What is it ?

250
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:15,844
He had lunch here.

251
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:19,765
McDonald's quarter-pounder
with cheese.

252
00:27:22,976 --> 00:27:24,311
Damn.

253
00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:32,027
- Damn!
- That's four.

254
00:27:33,946 --> 00:27:36,824
All right, you won this one.
Come on out!

255
00:27:39,952 --> 00:27:42,871
Soldier, how did you get
that close to me?

256
00:27:42,955 --> 00:27:47,084
Sniper approached instructor by being
a sneaky bastard, Sergeant Major!

257
00:27:48,961 --> 00:27:52,548
Do you know the fine for littering
in California, Chavez?

258
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:54,508
Yes, sir!

259
00:27:58,011 --> 00:28:01,181
I saw you on the sniper course.
You looked good.

260
00:28:02,015 --> 00:28:05,018
- Just about finished here, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.

261
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:08,730
Looking forward to taking
some leave with your wife and kids?

262
00:28:10,023 --> 00:28:13,443
- Don't have any wife or kids, sir.
- What do you have?

263
00:28:14,987 --> 00:28:19,074
You don't call anybody often, you
don't write or receive many letters.

264
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:26,415
Who are you, sir, if I may ask?

265
00:28:26,999 --> 00:28:31,128
Mr Clark and I are putting together
a mission. My team is a part of it.

266
00:28:32,004 --> 00:28:36,008
You'll be gone up to six months,
after which, if you're not dead, -

267
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:40,429
- you'lI have a choice
of assignments in Special Ops.

268
00:28:57,029 --> 00:29:00,824
...defusing an issue that was
snowballing into another scandal,

269
00:29:02,034 --> 00:29:05,496
The Tim is reportin h you
and Hardin were good fri. ds?

270
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,167
No, not good fri. ds.
We were lifelong fri. ds.

271
00:29:12,044 --> 00:29:14,213
I said that. I said that.

272
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:19,176
I told him to say that.

273
00:29:20,093 --> 00:29:22,596
- What?
- I didn't say anything.

274
00:29:24,097 --> 00:29:26,934
- But you were thinking something.
- No.

275
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:31,271
I was just distracted by the trouble
you were having with your ensemble.

276
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:36,485
Well, it's not every day
you have to look trustworthy.

277
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:41,281
- Who told who to say what?
- It's not important.

278
00:29:43,075 --> 00:29:45,244
- The President?
- Yeah.

279
00:29:46,078 --> 00:29:49,289
Mom says she makes more money
than the President.

280
00:29:50,082 --> 00:29:52,292
She's probably right. Bye.

281
00:30:02,135 --> 00:30:05,013
Thank you, Dr Ryan,
for your information.

282
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:10,519
- Thank you, Senator.
- We must help the Colombians -

283
00:30:11,144 --> 00:30:14,815
- in their struggle to curtail
the drug cartels' activities.

284
00:30:15,148 --> 00:30:18,610
However, I'm confused.
How do you see additional funds -

285
00:30:22,114 --> 00:30:25,117
- advancing this programme
from the failure that it is?

286
00:30:25,117 --> 00:30:28,620
- You see what I'm getting at?
- No, I'm afraid I don't.

287
00:30:29,121 --> 00:30:32,666
You said this effort would be
totally benign on our part.

288
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:36,461
Our assistance is limited
to supply and advice only.

289
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:39,923
I've read that.

290
00:30:40,174 --> 00:30:43,635
I've also read a similar finding
written 35 years ago -

291
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:49,141
- regarding a little-thought-of
sliver of jungle in Southeast Asia.

292
00:30:49,183 --> 00:30:53,145
Sorry, you're comparing our request
for anti-drug funds to Vietnam?

293
00:30:55,189 --> 00:30:59,109
I'm comparing it to every time
a committee such as this is asked -

294
00:30:59,193 --> 00:31:02,613
- to render judgement
based on less than all the facts.

295
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:10,162
I'm afraid I don't know
what to say to that.

296
00:31:10,162 --> 00:31:13,165
You can assure us
that we have all the facts.

297
00:31:13,165 --> 00:31:14,958
I thought I had.

298
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:18,837
You can further assure us then
that this increase in funds -

299
00:31:21,215 --> 00:31:24,468
- will not be used for
any covert military action.

300
00:31:25,219 --> 00:31:28,055
I don't know how
you're getting to this.

301
00:31:28,222 --> 00:31:30,224
Long experience, sir.

302
00:31:32,226 --> 00:31:33,977
No troops then?

303
00:31:34,228 --> 00:31:38,315
I enunciate that clearly because l
don't want there to be any mistake.

304
00:31:40,234 --> 00:31:41,735
No troops.

305
00:31:42,194 --> 00:31:44,988
You could say
I have your word on that?

306
00:31:45,197 --> 00:31:47,699
You could indeed, because you do.

307
00:32:03,257 --> 00:32:06,760
Listen up! Dog tags...
Take them off, pass them forward.

308
00:32:10,264 --> 00:32:14,268
Check your pockets for anything
that can be used for identification.

309
00:32:24,236 --> 00:32:25,988
We're feet dry.

310
00:32:39,251 --> 00:32:41,753
Landing zone in sight. Get ready.

311
00:32:42,254 --> 00:32:44,631
Good luck, boys. Go get them.

312
00:32:49,303 --> 00:32:51,597
OK, let's take her down now.

313
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:39,872
Hey, Bob.

314
00:34:42,374 --> 00:34:44,751
- How you doing?
- Good, sir.

315
00:34:45,377 --> 00:34:47,171
Good to see you.

316
00:34:54,428 --> 00:34:57,097
- Morning, Jack.
- Ryan! Come on in.

317
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:00,434
- Do you know everyone?
- Yes, yes.

318
00:35:00,434 --> 00:35:03,312
- Coffee? Bagel?
- Coffee. Black, please.

319
00:35:04,438 --> 00:35:06,940
- How's the family?
- Good, sir.

320
00:35:08,442 --> 00:35:12,362
- When do I meet the other Dr Ryan?
- She's dying to meet you, sir.

321
00:35:12,404 --> 00:35:14,406
Good, good. Sit down.

322
00:35:20,412 --> 00:35:22,956
- The cash is still there?
- Sir?

323
00:35:25,417 --> 00:35:28,921
- In Hardin's off-shore accounts.
- 650 million dollars.

324
00:35:29,421 --> 00:35:31,465
- And change.
- And change...

325
00:35:31,465 --> 00:35:34,551
- And we have the account numbers.
- Yes, sir.

326
00:35:35,469 --> 00:35:38,472
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's get it.

327
00:35:41,475 --> 00:35:45,187
Let's turn this thing around.
650 million dollars and change.

328
00:35:45,479 --> 00:35:48,607
It's worth ten times that
in political capital.

329
00:35:51,443 --> 00:35:52,778
What?

330
00:35:53,445 --> 00:35:57,407
Well... This connection between
Hardin and the cartels is a theory.

331
00:36:01,453 --> 00:36:03,831
- Theory?
- A theory of mine.

332
00:36:04,456 --> 00:36:07,751
- It's a theory?
- Well, I know the money is there.

333
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,839
But who exactly Hardin
was working for, I don't know.

334
00:36:13,507 --> 00:36:17,678
I think we would have to establish
that before we could seize the money.

335
00:36:21,515 --> 00:36:23,934
So go down there. Establish it.

336
00:36:24,518 --> 00:36:26,645
- Go where?
- Colombia.

337
00:36:29,523 --> 00:36:30,983
Who, me?

338
00:36:35,487 --> 00:36:39,449
I leave you alone for two weeks,
and you walk into a big bear trap.

339
00:36:40,492 --> 00:36:42,452
What was I thinking?

340
00:36:42,494 --> 00:36:46,665
You were thinking about impressing
the President. You shouldn't do that.

341
00:36:49,501 --> 00:36:51,587
- November.
- January.

342
00:36:52,504 --> 00:36:54,214
Of last year.

343
00:36:57,551 --> 00:37:01,138
There's a guy down there,
at least he used to be... Clark.

344
00:37:02,556 --> 00:37:04,725
We go way back. Good man.

345
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:08,228
If you hit a brick wall, look him up.

346
00:37:09,563 --> 00:37:11,273
Admiral Greer?

347
00:37:12,566 --> 00:37:14,860
- Chemotherapy.
- Oh, shit.

348
00:37:16,528 --> 00:37:18,363
Here we go again.

349
00:37:19,531 --> 00:37:21,575
How's Ritter behaving?

350
00:37:22,534 --> 00:37:25,329
Ritter's Ritter.
He's leaving me alone.

351
00:37:26,538 --> 00:37:29,208
Are you sure?
Watch him like a hawk.

352
00:37:30,542 --> 00:37:33,128
- How are you feeling today?
- OK.

353
00:37:33,545 --> 00:37:37,591
We'll get you in a room, give you
warm blankets, get you lying down.

354
00:37:39,593 --> 00:37:43,555
And then we'll get you back to
your room and get you comfortable...

355
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:39,778
Variable, this is Knife,
stand by to copy, over.

356
00:38:43,615 --> 00:38:46,618
Variable, this is Knife
stand by to copy, over.

357
00:38:46,618 --> 00:38:50,247
Knife, this is Variable,
your signal is five by five, over.

358
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:55,002
Clear.

359
00:39:19,693 --> 00:39:22,112
The chicken is in the pot. Over.

360
00:39:23,655 --> 00:39:25,824
- Cook it.
- Roger that,

361
00:39:43,717 --> 00:39:45,594
Honey..? I'm late.

362
00:39:48,722 --> 00:39:50,557
Have a good trip.

363
00:39:51,725 --> 00:39:53,727
I'm not gonna say it.

364
00:39:54,728 --> 00:39:56,104
Don't.

365
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,315
Be careful.

366
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:30,889
Local tim s, well, actually, it 's
the same as Washington, 1 1. 16 a.m.

367
00:40:33,767 --> 00:40:36,562
Temperature is
69 degrees Fahrenheit...

368
00:40:42,776 --> 00:40:44,361
Doctor Ryan!

369
00:40:54,746 --> 00:40:57,791
DEA Special Agent Jean Fowler.
How you doing?

370
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,752
- First time in Bogota?
- Yeah.

371
00:41:00,752 --> 00:41:04,298
Let's not stand here
and let someone take a shot at you.

372
00:41:22,816 --> 00:41:25,486
- And these two?
- They're brothers.

373
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:32,493
Don't do that. Give Dr Ryan
a bit more air back here, please.

374
00:41:32,784 --> 00:41:34,411
Bulletproof.

375
00:41:42,794 --> 00:41:46,381
We don't have a picture.
Escobedo's intelligence officer.

376
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:50,135
We don't have a name either,
but we know he exists.

377
00:41:50,844 --> 00:41:52,721
The invisible man?

378
00:41:53,847 --> 00:41:56,308
Gently, gently, with your hands.

379
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:59,228
Luis, put your hands together.

380
00:42:00,854 --> 00:42:02,981
No, your hands together!

381
00:42:06,819 --> 00:42:08,904
Luis, watch the cantor!

382
00:42:10,823 --> 00:42:12,574
Yes, very good!

383
00:42:21,834 --> 00:42:23,877
We lost another plane.

384
00:42:31,885 --> 00:42:34,847
- Who is doing this?
- If I had to guess...

385
00:42:35,889 --> 00:42:38,892
No, I did not ask you to guess.
I can guess.

386
00:42:40,894 --> 00:42:42,896
Someone's been talking
to the drug police.

387
00:42:42,896 --> 00:42:46,900
lmpossible. If anyone spoke to the
police, I'd be the first to know.

388
00:42:47,901 --> 00:42:49,319
Ernesto!

389
00:42:51,864 --> 00:42:56,076
ls one of the others trying to ruin
me, after what I did to the American?

390
00:42:56,869 --> 00:43:00,706
I guess that wasn't quite
the deterrent you thought it would be.

391
00:43:02,875 --> 00:43:04,793
Find out who it is.

392
00:43:12,926 --> 00:43:15,470
What do you make of this, Colonel?

393
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:18,682
An opportunity.

394
00:43:20,934 --> 00:43:22,936
An opportunity, Sipo.

395
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:40,621
- Good afternoon.
- Messages, please?

396
00:43:42,915 --> 00:43:45,542
- Dr Ryan?
- Clark? Sorry I'm late.

397
00:43:46,919 --> 00:43:48,921
I've got ten minutes.

398
00:43:51,965 --> 00:43:55,761
I'm positive Hardin was tied
into the cartels. It's drug money.

399
00:43:55,969 --> 00:43:58,597
- But you can't prove it.
- So far.

400
00:44:01,975 --> 00:44:04,686
- Mind if I ask you a question?
- No.

401
00:44:04,978 --> 00:44:09,274
Why are you telling me all this? I've
been out of the game for a long time.

402
00:44:13,946 --> 00:44:18,033
I was told that you were wired, and
that you knew the town and people.

403
00:44:18,951 --> 00:44:22,037
- That you were a player.
- Who told you that?

404
00:44:23,956 --> 00:44:25,499
Jim Greer.

405
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,711
How's he doing?

406
00:44:33,006 --> 00:44:34,716
He's not good.

407
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:38,720
He has cancer.

408
00:44:39,012 --> 00:44:40,514
Terminal.

409
00:44:43,016 --> 00:44:45,435
- He's a good man.
- The best.

410
00:44:53,986 --> 00:44:56,363
You a coffee drinker, Dr Ryan?

411
00:44:58,991 --> 00:45:02,035
- Yeah, I like coffee.
- Try the Lindo brand.

412
00:45:02,995 --> 00:45:05,581
- Lindo?
- I think you'll like it.

413
00:45:13,005 --> 00:45:15,799
Mr President,
I've got some good news.

414
00:45:16,049 --> 00:45:20,053
Hardin's partner here was someone
you may know of. Ernesto Escobedo.

415
00:45:23,056 --> 00:45:26,268
- lt figures.
- ls this another of your theories?

416
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:31,273
No, sir. We can call this one fact.
Escobedo, like every druglord here, -

417
00:45:33,066 --> 00:45:37,154
- also had legitimate businesses.
Hardin was doing business with these.

418
00:45:39,031 --> 00:45:42,618
Importin mong other things,
coffee, which means nothing, -

419
00:45:44,036 --> 00:45:48,040
- but he was paying too much for
this coffee. 6,200 dollars a pound.

420
00:45:51,043 --> 00:45:54,171
- That's expensive coffee.
- I'd have to agree.

421
00:45:55,047 --> 00:45:57,925
This is good news.
I think this does it.

422
00:45:58,091 --> 00:46:01,512
Sir, I also have some other news
which is not so good.

423
00:46:03,096 --> 00:46:04,097
Oh God...

424
00:46:04,097 --> 00:46:08,060
The DEA feels that the government
here would want the seized funds.

425
00:46:11,104 --> 00:46:14,399
- Or at least a large portion.
- This is our money.

426
00:46:16,109 --> 00:46:19,154
- We found it.
- We can try telling them that,

427
00:46:20,072 --> 00:46:23,075
Try? Tell them.
Or don't tell them, I don't care.

428
00:46:23,075 --> 00:46:27,037
- Sir, with all due respect...
- This is our money, tell them that,

429
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:32,084
I wouldn't know what to say or
where to start, I'm not a negotiator.

430
00:46:33,085 --> 00:46:35,712
You know someone
in the government?

431
00:46:36,088 --> 00:46:39,132
I went to school
with their Attorney General.

432
00:46:39,132 --> 00:46:42,719
Jacobs will come down.
He'll negotiate. This is our money.

433
00:46:45,138 --> 00:46:46,598
Thank...

434
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:48,684
Thank you.

435
00:46:52,145 --> 00:46:53,939
I hate this job.

436
00:48:12,226 --> 00:48:13,685
Eyes up!

437
00:48:17,231 --> 00:48:18,941
Demo Team, up!

438
00:48:26,198 --> 00:48:28,033
Fire in the hole!

439
00:48:33,205 --> 00:48:36,083
Let's go, let's go!
Move out! Go, go, go!

440
00:48:58,272 --> 00:49:00,482
Whoever did this, is dead.

441
00:49:02,276 --> 00:49:04,695
Whoever did this to me, is dead!

442
00:49:06,238 --> 00:49:09,158
Do you hear me?!
Are you listening to me?!

443
00:49:25,299 --> 00:49:28,510
Mr Jacobs, could you sign these
before you leave?

444
00:49:30,304 --> 00:49:33,348
Moira... Why don't you
call in sick tomorrow?

445
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:39,104
And the next day.
I won't tell anybody.

446
00:49:39,313 --> 00:49:42,441
Even when you're not here
there's plenty to do.

447
00:49:43,317 --> 00:49:46,695
- Your itinerary.
- You're arguing with me about this?

448
00:49:47,279 --> 00:49:49,448
You work too hard. Adios.

449
00:50:30,322 --> 00:50:33,200
- Landa & Landa.
- Roberto Landa, please.

450
00:50:33,325 --> 00:50:36,411
- This is Moira Wolfson.
- One moment, please.

451
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:40,874
I think he's on the factory floor.

452
00:50:47,339 --> 00:50:50,050
- Yes?
- A Moira Wolfson is calling.

453
00:50:52,386 --> 00:50:55,639
I told heryou were
on the factory floor. Go ahead.

454
00:50:57,391 --> 00:50:59,268
- Moira.. !
- Hi.

455
00:51:00,394 --> 00:51:03,188
You free the next couple of days?
I am.

456
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,652
My boss is leavin h ountry.

457
00:51:11,363 --> 00:51:14,908
- Can I call you later?
- All rig , call me at home. Bye.

458
00:51:25,377 --> 00:51:28,755
Good afternoon.
Good news in the fight against drugs.

459
00:51:31,425 --> 00:51:34,553
An investigation
by the Department of Justice -

460
00:51:35,429 --> 00:51:38,932
- has identified several
bank accounts from Luxembourg -

461
00:51:40,434 --> 00:51:43,896
- to the Cayman Islands,
used for launderin rug money -

462
00:51:44,438 --> 00:51:48,150
- on an unprecedented scale.
Wit h five foreign governments -

463
00:51:49,443 --> 00:51:52,446
- we have taken action
to seize those funds -

464
00:51:53,405 --> 00:51:56,366
- which amount to
over 650 million dollars.

465
00:51:59,411 --> 00:52:03,457
Also to seize 20 real estate joint-
venture investments in the U.S. -

466
00:52:04,416 --> 00:52:08,212
- which were the primary agencies
in the laundering operations.

467
00:52:10,422 --> 00:52:12,925
You did say 650 million dollars?

468
00:52:13,467 --> 00:52:16,512
That's rig .
650 million dollars. And change.

469
00:52:17,471 --> 00:52:19,681
They're stealing my money!

470
00:52:20,474 --> 00:52:23,810
- What's our take?
- It's hard to say at the moment,

471
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:30,567
No, it isn't. You're stealing my
money. I made it, you're stealing it!

472
00:52:31,485 --> 00:52:35,239
Mr President, can we speak with
FBI Director Jacobs about this?

473
00:52:37,449 --> 00:52:40,911
- Jacobs is not available.
- Someone will die for this.

474
00:52:41,453 --> 00:52:45,290
He's personally involved in the
investig ion and is pretty busy.

475
00:52:57,511 --> 00:53:01,431
This avenue has to be avoided.
They'll be coming from the airport.

476
00:53:02,516 --> 00:53:06,186
Up Avenida Aeropuerto El Dorado
all the way to Gran America.

477
00:53:07,521 --> 00:53:11,316
Santa Fe's our spot. As much as
I'd love to be here for this, -

478
00:53:11,525 --> 00:53:15,529
- I have to take care of business
in Washington, tying up loose ends.

479
00:53:26,498 --> 00:53:29,168
Hello?
Don't hang up, don't hang up.

480
00:53:31,503 --> 00:53:34,423
- Hello?
- Your machine is still n, Moira.

481
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:11,752
- Emil, good to see you.
- Good to see you, Andy.

482
00:54:12,544 --> 00:54:16,089
- Agent Murray, Ambassador Ferris.
- Hi, good to see you.

483
00:54:17,591 --> 00:54:21,094
- This will bring you up to date.
- All right, let's go.

484
00:54:35,609 --> 00:54:38,529
- How's the food?
- It's like Mexican food.

485
00:54:40,572 --> 00:54:43,700
- You hate Mexican food.
- I hate Mexican food.

486
00:55:19,611 --> 00:55:21,363
- Hi.
- Hello.

487
00:55:22,614 --> 00:55:26,869
All my secretary knows about America
is what she reads in People magazine.

488
00:55:27,619 --> 00:55:30,706
- How's the place?
- Come inside and find out.

489
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:40,340
It's...awful.

490
00:55:43,677 --> 00:55:45,179
lsn't it?

491
00:56:09,661 --> 00:56:12,623
So I take it you shouldn't
drink the water?

492
00:56:13,665 --> 00:56:17,503
They put water in your room,
but I'd stick to the bottled stuff.

493
00:57:07,761 --> 00:57:10,430
So what do you brush your teeth with?

494
00:57:10,764 --> 00:57:14,852
You use the bottled water, or you'll
be in the can all your time here.

495
00:57:22,776 --> 00:57:25,571
The hold-up was
a government connection?

496
00:58:19,791 --> 00:58:21,627
Back up! Back up!

497
00:58:27,841 --> 00:58:30,552
- Step on it!
- Stay down. Stay down.

498
00:58:44,858 --> 00:58:46,693
Damn it! Back up!

499
00:58:50,823 --> 00:58:53,784
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Take it easy, Andy.

500
00:58:54,827 --> 00:58:57,162
Got to keep moving. Go, Jack!

501
00:59:13,887 --> 00:59:15,389
lncoming!

502
00:59:55,929 --> 00:59:57,222
Dan!

503
01:00:28,921 --> 01:00:30,422
Dan! Dan!

504
01:00:40,974 --> 01:00:42,893
We can't stay here!

505
01:00:45,979 --> 01:00:48,065
The car! ls it running?

506
01:00:48,982 --> 01:00:50,651
It's running!

507
01:00:50,984 --> 01:00:54,696
The smoke will give us cover.
It's our only chance. I got him.

508
01:00:55,948 --> 01:00:58,742
Break for the driver's side.
Ready? Go!

509
01:01:08,961 --> 01:01:10,921
- Get in!
- Go! Go!

510
01:02:16,069 --> 01:02:17,696
Housekeeping.

511
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,042
Oh, excuse me, ma'am.

512
01:02:40,093 --> 01:02:43,096
- You have a call for Dr Ryan?
- Just a moment.

513
01:02:43,096 --> 01:02:47,017
...in the streets ofBogota today.
Ten were kill and eight wounded.

514
01:02:50,103 --> 01:02:53,023
Five ofthe dead
were security personnel,..

515
01:02:54,107 --> 01:02:56,944
- Cathy?
- Don't tell me you're in this.

516
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:02,282
Right in the middle of it.
Honey, Dan was killed.

517
01:03:03,075 --> 01:03:04,660
Dan Murray.

518
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:11,333
I was 1 0 feet away.
There was nothing I could do.

519
01:03:14,086 --> 01:03:16,547
- I'm coming home.
- Thank God.

520
01:03:17,089 --> 01:03:18,674
I love you.

521
01:03:25,138 --> 01:03:28,142
- Wasn't his going there a secret?
- lt was.

522
01:03:28,142 --> 01:03:31,520
- Then I don't get it. What happened?
- Nobody knows.

523
01:03:33,147 --> 01:03:37,109
- How stupid are these people?
- They believe they can do anything.

524
01:03:38,152 --> 01:03:40,487
You know what?
They're wrong.

525
01:03:41,113 --> 01:03:43,448
- Yes, sir.
- They're wrong.

526
01:03:45,117 --> 01:03:49,163
They've directly challenged the
sovereign power of the United States.

527
01:03:51,123 --> 01:03:53,292
No more sending messages.

528
01:03:54,126 --> 01:03:57,963
He wants them to get the message
whether the phone rings or not.

529
01:03:58,130 --> 01:04:01,592
- Those are his words?
- Do they sound like his words?

530
01:04:03,177 --> 01:04:06,722
He can't be clear when clarity is
what he wants to avoid.

531
01:04:08,182 --> 01:04:10,851
What he means is the gloves come off.

532
01:04:29,161 --> 01:04:32,206
I'm telling you,
I had nothing to do with it.

533
01:04:34,166 --> 01:04:37,169
I wish I had done it,
they deserved it. But it wasn't me.

534
01:04:37,169 --> 01:04:38,837
Who did then?

535
01:04:40,172 --> 01:04:42,591
You know, you have no answers.

536
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:49,348
ls this the way it was with Castro?
No answers?

537
01:04:50,224 --> 01:04:53,393
- You don't want to hear an answer.
- Yes, I do.

538
01:04:55,229 --> 01:04:58,816
lt was done to look like you did it.
By one of the others.

539
01:04:59,233 --> 01:05:02,820
As you suspected. It's always
a friend who hates you most.

540
01:05:03,195 --> 01:05:05,072
Give me the phone.

541
01:05:12,204 --> 01:05:14,748
- Rojas.
- Did you do this thing?

542
01:05:15,207 --> 01:05:19,169
Did I do this thing? Are you calling
to ask me if I did this thing?

543
01:05:21,213 --> 01:05:24,424
You don't consult with us.
You put us in danger.

544
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:29,263
And now you want me
to believe it wasn'tyou?

545
01:05:30,264 --> 01:05:32,182
It wasn't, Enrique.

546
01:05:32,266 --> 01:05:35,269
The Americans will
retaliate against us all.

547
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:38,939
I swear I had
nothing to do with it.

548
01:05:39,273 --> 01:05:42,276
Why do you expect me
to lis n to these lies?

549
01:05:43,277 --> 01:05:45,779
- Goodbye, Ernesto.
- No, no, no!

550
01:05:46,238 --> 01:05:48,991
Don't hang up.
We must have a meeting.

551
01:05:49,241 --> 01:05:51,660
- When?
- As soon as possible.

552
01:05:55,247 --> 01:05:58,667
Tomorrow night. I am not
telling you, I am asking you!

553
01:06:01,253 --> 01:06:04,548
- May we meet tomorrow night?
- Tomorrow afternoon.

554
01:06:36,288 --> 01:06:40,167
He's scared. I don't know what
you said to him, but it was right.

555
01:08:14,428 --> 01:08:16,430
Strange, don't you think?

556
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:19,933
Jacobs and his secretary
getting killed on the same day.

557
01:08:22,436 --> 01:08:25,981
lt wasn't his secretary.
He was a member of the security.

558
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:27,733
Who?

559
01:08:30,444 --> 01:08:33,864
- I don't remember his name.
- I'm talking about Moira.

560
01:08:35,407 --> 01:08:38,035
Moira, remember?
Jacobs' secretary.

561
01:08:38,410 --> 01:08:41,580
I know Moira, honey.
What are you talking about?

562
01:08:47,419 --> 01:08:50,422
- She said he was a Latin Jack Ryan.
- He was.

563
01:08:50,422 --> 01:08:54,009
- That's what she called him.
- The point is, he's Latin.

564
01:08:55,469 --> 01:08:59,598
Which connects her death and Jacobs'
beyond their working relationship.

565
01:09:00,474 --> 01:09:04,144
You saw somebody you think
is responsible for both killings?

566
01:09:07,481 --> 01:09:08,941
She did.

567
01:09:11,485 --> 01:09:12,945
She did.

568
01:09:20,452 --> 01:09:23,247
I saw him from a distance.
From behind.

569
01:09:23,455 --> 01:09:27,209
- Medium height, medium build, etc?
- Mind if I look at these?

570
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:31,463
ls that what the people
from the cabin said?

571
01:09:34,508 --> 01:09:37,469
Did you check out
these calls to Venezuela?

572
01:09:39,513 --> 01:09:41,181
Disconnected.

573
01:09:44,518 --> 01:09:47,479
- So you have no leads?
- Oh, I have a lot.

574
01:09:48,522 --> 01:09:52,526
A fictitious name on a register. A
stolen phoned in credit card number.

575
01:09:52,526 --> 01:09:56,238
Two eyewitnesses, one of whom
saw a guy, but didn't see him...

576
01:09:57,489 --> 01:10:00,200
Excuse me,
could you play that again?

577
01:10:03,495 --> 01:10:05,497
The machine is still n, Moira!

578
01:10:05,497 --> 01:10:08,458
You have a recording
of the killer's voice.

579
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:09,877
Maybe.

580
01:10:14,506 --> 01:10:18,635
Jack. I think we've got something.
This is from the answering machine.

581
01:10:20,554 --> 01:10:23,974
And this was recorded yesterday.
I'll play it for you.

582
01:10:28,562 --> 01:10:30,939
The machine is still n, Moira.

583
01:10:34,568 --> 01:10:38,363
He's scared. I don't know what
you said to him, but it was rig .

584
01:10:39,531 --> 01:10:41,867
Colonel, run a match on that.

585
01:10:44,536 --> 01:10:46,121
He's Cuban.

586
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:50,167
35-45 years.

587
01:10:51,543 --> 01:10:54,922
Educated in the United States.
Eastern United States.

588
01:10:56,548 --> 01:10:59,301
- It's the same voice.
- You're sure?

589
01:10:59,593 --> 01:11:01,553
- Yeah.
- How sure?

590
01:11:07,601 --> 01:11:09,186
90 percent.

591
01:11:10,604 --> 01:11:13,607
- I need a name.
- Could be hundreds of thousands...

592
01:11:13,607 --> 01:11:16,568
I know. I need a name,
and I need it quick.

593
01:11:34,586 --> 01:11:36,338
300 is topside.

594
01:12:21,675 --> 01:12:23,385
Target is set.

595
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:28,682
- Hector!
- Enrique!

596
01:12:30,684 --> 01:12:32,478
Good to see you!

597
01:12:32,686 --> 01:12:34,771
lt was not easy for us.

598
01:12:36,690 --> 01:12:38,400
Rojas, Diaz...

599
01:12:43,655 --> 01:12:44,656
What the hell is this?

600
01:12:44,656 --> 01:12:46,700
What the hell is this?

601
01:12:49,661 --> 01:12:51,622
My new toy. Like it?

602
01:12:53,665 --> 01:12:55,334
You see this?

603
01:12:55,667 --> 01:12:58,962
That's your new target,
unless it's not big enough.

604
01:13:05,719 --> 01:13:08,889
Variable, this is Easy Rhino.
Do you copy? Over.

605
01:13:09,723 --> 01:13:11,975
Loud and clear, Easy Rhino.

606
01:13:12,726 --> 01:13:15,354
- Do we have a gig?
- That's a Rog.

607
01:13:22,736 --> 01:13:24,404
Target is lit.

608
01:13:25,697 --> 01:13:27,491
Start the music.

609
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:30,327
Into attack.

610
01:13:30,702 --> 01:13:34,164
Pickle's hot, Target is acquired
and lit . Coming down.

611
01:13:40,712 --> 01:13:43,674
Fernandez, Vega...
Looks like a full house.

612
01:13:56,770 --> 01:13:59,523
Damn it!
Why doesn't he fix this road?

613
01:14:00,774 --> 01:14:03,193
Shit! Thought we had everybody.

614
01:14:04,778 --> 01:14:06,864
Keep the target painted.

615
01:14:35,809 --> 01:14:37,102
Sir?

616
01:14:42,816 --> 01:14:44,151
Boom.

617
01:14:53,785 --> 01:14:55,496
Mother of God!

618
01:14:59,791 --> 01:15:01,793
Circular error probability zero.

619
01:15:01,793 --> 01:15:05,088
Impact with high order detonation.
Have a nice day.

620
01:15:24,858 --> 01:15:27,277
His name is Cortez, Felix rtez.

621
01:15:28,821 --> 01:15:32,407
A colonel in Cuba's intelligence
service until e ears ago.

622
01:15:32,825 --> 01:15:36,829
Turned up working for the Macheteros
terrorist group in Puerto Rico.

623
01:15:37,830 --> 01:15:42,125
Disappeared again. Yesterday we taped
him talking to a Cali cartel subject.

624
01:15:43,836 --> 01:15:47,214
I'll fax what I've got.
If he shows, pick him up, ok?

625
01:15:48,841 --> 01:15:52,052
- You know I can't do that,
- I mean the police.

626
01:15:52,886 --> 01:15:56,431
The Colombian police don't pick up
members of the cartel.

627
01:15:57,891 --> 01:16:01,353
Unless they've got a death wish.
You've been down here.

628
01:16:01,895 --> 01:16:03,605
Wait a minute.

629
01:16:03,897 --> 01:16:06,900
Oh Jesus...
Jack, something's happened here.

630
01:16:20,873 --> 01:16:24,543
At least 30 people were kill ,
including women and children.

631
01:16:25,878 --> 01:16:29,464
The bomb exploded in a car
belonging to a Rojas associate.

632
01:16:29,882 --> 01:16:32,759
- Jack..?
- Yeah, are you watching this?

633
01:16:33,927 --> 01:16:36,555
- Did this just happen?
- Just now.

634
01:16:39,933 --> 01:16:43,854
Send me all the stuff, and we'll
put a tail on him if we spot him.

635
01:16:44,938 --> 01:16:47,524
Ifhe's still live.
I've got to go.

636
01:16:52,905 --> 01:16:55,908
- A surgical strike, you said.
- lt was perfect.

637
01:16:55,908 --> 01:16:59,620
- That's a dead kid. On NBC.
- Take the gloves off, you said.

638
01:17:00,913 --> 01:17:03,916
- I know what I said.
- A bit late to change your mind.

639
01:17:03,916 --> 01:17:06,084
I'm not changing my mind.

640
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:11,215
I hadn't counted on
this kind of collateral damage.

641
01:17:12,966 --> 01:17:15,969
- Neither had he.
- lt will be interpreted as I said.

642
01:17:15,969 --> 01:17:19,056
Rivalry that ended
in the blast of a car bomb.

643
01:17:19,973 --> 01:17:21,558
Good night.

644
01:17:36,949 --> 01:17:40,452
- Morning, Rose. Finish the report?
- Hot off the press.

645
01:17:42,955 --> 01:17:46,250
Could any of the bombing victims'
names be aliases?

646
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:51,588
No. All I.D.'s have been confirmed.
Who are you hoping for?

647
01:17:52,965 --> 01:17:56,468
If he's not here, he's not here.
Cortez. He's not here.

648
01:17:59,012 --> 01:18:02,641
- Why was Operations copied on this?
- Ritter requested it.

649
01:18:04,017 --> 01:18:06,562
Ritter?
You look very nice today.

650
01:18:08,021 --> 01:18:09,565
Thank you.

651
01:18:23,996 --> 01:18:25,581
Car bomb...

652
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:37,801
What happens
when a car bomb goes off?

653
01:18:38,051 --> 01:18:40,762
- lt explodes.
- lt blows up and out?

654
01:18:42,055 --> 01:18:43,765
And a missile?

655
01:18:48,061 --> 01:18:51,064
- This deeper crater?
- That's characteristic.

656
01:18:51,064 --> 01:18:53,400
Bring up the satellite photo.

657
01:18:59,031 --> 01:19:00,657
HMX and TNT.

658
01:19:03,035 --> 01:19:06,455
When you mix it 70-30
you get a compound called Octol.

659
01:19:07,039 --> 01:19:10,042
Enough explosives in a car
give a crater that big.

660
01:19:10,042 --> 01:19:14,046
- It's very stable. Very expensive.
- Would it still be in the crater?

661
01:19:14,046 --> 01:19:17,341
- Very violent,
- There would be pieces all around.

662
01:19:18,091 --> 01:19:21,637
- Where is Octol made?
- Lots of places. Europe. The U.S.

663
01:19:25,098 --> 01:19:28,811
But nobody uses it. Nobody can
afford it except the military.

664
01:19:30,103 --> 01:19:33,774
An aerial bomb would do that.
But that's not an aerial bomb.

665
01:19:37,110 --> 01:19:40,239
There is also
a cellulose residue on everything.

666
01:19:41,073 --> 01:19:43,909
There should be shrapnel.
Here and here.

667
01:19:44,076 --> 01:19:46,870
- But there isn't.
- No bomb fragments.

668
01:20:32,124 --> 01:20:35,043
"Cellulose encased
laser-guided bomb"...

669
01:20:39,131 --> 01:20:40,507
Paper.

670
01:20:44,178 --> 01:20:46,263
The Americans are here.

671
01:21:16,168 --> 01:21:19,922
"We have something in common.
Neither can implementpolicy" -

672
01:21:21,173 --> 01:21:24,551
- "without tacit authoris ion
from our employer. "

673
01:21:25,219 --> 01:21:29,139
"We also both know that there are
American troops in Colombia" -

674
01:21:30,224 --> 01:21:32,559
- "fig ing an ill al war. "

675
01:21:34,228 --> 01:21:38,023
"I will at Hotel Paloma de Oro
in Panama City on Wednesday. "

676
01:21:40,234 --> 01:21:42,319
"I suggest we meet, "

677
01:22:33,245 --> 01:22:35,873
- 6, this is Point, Over.
- 6 here.

678
01:22:39,251 --> 01:22:43,463
The stuff's here, a lot of it. I'm also
looking at 1 00-1 50 men, armed -

679
01:22:46,258 --> 01:22:48,969
- waiting around for something. Over.

680
01:22:49,303 --> 01:22:51,305
Colombian Army? Over.

681
01:22:56,310 --> 01:22:59,021
Negative.
They look like mercenaries.

682
01:22:59,313 --> 01:23:02,149
All right. Get back here.
Abort mission.

683
01:23:03,317 --> 01:23:05,777
I say again, abort mission. Out.

684
01:23:07,321 --> 01:23:09,031
1 50 armed men?

685
01:23:31,345 --> 01:23:33,472
Raise your arms, please.

686
01:23:48,362 --> 01:23:51,698
Thank you for responding to my note.
And so promptly.

687
01:23:53,325 --> 01:23:56,495
I had nothing to do
with the death of Mr Jacobs.

688
01:23:57,329 --> 01:24:01,041
lt was an act of madness.
But typical for the men I work for.

689
01:24:04,336 --> 01:24:07,548
- What do you want?
- Same as you. Mineral water.

690
01:24:09,341 --> 01:24:13,345
You agree that as long as Americans
want drugs, they will supplied?

691
01:24:14,388 --> 01:24:17,391
I don't want to be here
longer than I have to.

692
01:24:17,391 --> 01:24:20,394
You mentioned a gang war.
What does that mean?

693
01:24:20,394 --> 01:24:23,230
- That we want the same thing.
- Really?

694
01:24:25,399 --> 01:24:29,486
So far you've done all the work.
You've taken care of the little fish.

695
01:24:30,404 --> 01:24:33,282
I will take care of
the one that got away.

696
01:24:33,365 --> 01:24:36,994
Once Escobedo is gone,
I will be in a position to help you.

697
01:24:38,370 --> 01:24:41,665
- You want to help me?
- Your country. Your people.

698
01:24:42,374 --> 01:24:45,627
By restructuring the drug trade.
By regulating it.

699
01:24:48,380 --> 01:24:52,468
What'd you say if I said I'd halve
the cocaine shipments to the U.S.?

700
01:24:56,430 --> 01:24:59,683
I'd say you'd been using
too much of your product.

701
01:25:00,434 --> 01:25:03,812
I can also give you regular quotas
on major arrests -

702
01:25:04,438 --> 01:25:07,232
- that your police
can take credit for.

703
01:25:07,441 --> 01:25:10,569
lmagine. Dramatic seizures.
Drastic reductions.

704
01:25:11,445 --> 01:25:14,781
No more senseless violence.
You'lI have your victory.

705
01:25:20,412 --> 01:25:22,331
In return for what?

706
01:25:23,415 --> 01:25:26,460
I also need a victory,
to establis ypositi. -

707
01:25:27,419 --> 01:25:30,756
- with what is left ofthe cartel,
so I can help you.

708
01:25:32,424 --> 01:25:36,261
I need to defeat those soldiers
blowing up everything they see.

709
01:25:38,472 --> 01:25:42,226
Give me maps of their locations.
Cut off their communications.

710
01:25:50,484 --> 01:25:54,321
DEA's sending the audio surveillance
tape. I haven't got it yet.

711
01:25:58,450 --> 01:26:01,954
You know what you think about...
when you're lying here?

712
01:26:05,457 --> 01:26:08,418
You know you're gonna die,
and you think...

713
01:26:10,462 --> 01:26:13,423
...that's all right.
You lived a long time.

714
01:26:15,509 --> 01:26:17,511
You had a family that loved you.

715
01:26:17,511 --> 01:26:20,722
You had a job that you thought
made a difference.

716
01:26:22,516 --> 01:26:24,977
That you thought was honourable.

717
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:28,564
And then you see this.

718
01:26:33,527 --> 01:26:36,029
I'm afraid if I dig any deeper...

719
01:26:37,489 --> 01:26:40,075
...no one's gonna like what I find.

720
01:26:45,497 --> 01:26:47,416
You took an oath...

721
01:26:49,501 --> 01:26:51,420
...if you recall...

722
01:26:54,506 --> 01:26:57,301
...when you first came
to work for me.

723
01:26:58,552 --> 01:27:02,264
And I don't mean to the National
Security Advisor of the U.S.

724
01:27:04,558 --> 01:27:06,477
I mean to his boss.

725
01:27:08,562 --> 01:27:10,981
And I don't mean the President.

726
01:27:12,566 --> 01:27:14,693
You gave your word to...

727
01:27:17,571 --> 01:27:19,156
...his boss.

728
01:27:20,532 --> 01:27:22,534
You gave your word...

729
01:27:22,534 --> 01:27:25,287
...to the people
of the United States.

730
01:27:28,540 --> 01:27:30,709
Your word is who you are.

731
01:27:36,548 --> 01:27:38,926
What else have you got there?

732
01:27:44,598 --> 01:27:47,100
I brought you some new magazines.

733
01:27:57,611 --> 01:28:01,573
The situation in East Timor seems
to have stabilised during the day.

734
01:28:03,575 --> 01:28:06,537
- ls that it?
- Except for the other thing.

735
01:28:08,580 --> 01:28:11,583
We've accomplished a lot,
we're seeing tangible results.

736
01:28:11,583 --> 01:28:15,045
Drug shipments are down.
Price on the street is rising.

737
01:28:15,587 --> 01:28:19,258
The administration is perceived
to be doing something right.

738
01:28:20,634 --> 01:28:22,594
What's the bad news?

739
01:28:24,638 --> 01:28:28,892
I'm worried about the car bomb coming
so soon after Jacobs' assassination.

740
01:28:32,646 --> 01:28:35,566
Just the kind of thing
reporters live for.

741
01:28:35,649 --> 01:28:39,403
- They'd love to make a connection.
- And you think they will?

742
01:28:40,654 --> 01:28:43,615
I think it's time
the whole thing went away.

743
01:28:45,617 --> 01:28:48,495
- If that's what you think.
- I think so.

744
01:28:50,622 --> 01:28:53,542
Then it should go away.
lt never happened.

745
01:29:01,633 --> 01:29:03,385
It's possible.

746
01:29:03,677 --> 01:29:07,764
lt would be easier if you told me
whose system you want to break into.

747
01:29:08,682 --> 01:29:11,101
- Morning, Dr Ryan.
- Morning.

748
01:29:30,662 --> 01:29:33,081
We're way beyond birthdays now.

749
01:29:36,668 --> 01:29:39,880
I'm gonna have to write
a special programme here.

750
01:29:51,725 --> 01:29:54,269
OK, sweetheart, let's get to work.

751
01:29:56,730 --> 01:29:58,315
Fine, good.

752
01:29:59,733 --> 01:30:01,610
Yes... Here we go.

753
01:31:00,752 --> 01:31:02,921
Reciprocity. What's that?

754
01:31:16,810 --> 01:31:19,813
I forgot to tell you,
after you get the code, -

755
01:31:19,813 --> 01:31:23,692
- wait until he's off his system
before you log on. He will know.

756
01:31:24,818 --> 01:31:27,112
Jesus, Petey, it's too late.

757
01:31:27,821 --> 01:31:29,406
Oh my God...

758
01:32:00,854 --> 01:32:02,356
Cutter...

759
01:32:16,829 --> 01:32:19,832
- Bob, Jack Ryan here.
- Good morning, Jack.

760
01:32:21,834 --> 01:32:24,670
Listen, maybe we got off
to a bad start.

761
01:32:26,839 --> 01:32:30,676
If we're gonna work together,
we should get to know each other.

762
01:32:30,884 --> 01:32:34,012
Do you play tennis?
Tennis? Do you play tennis?

763
01:32:35,889 --> 01:32:39,184
- Yeah, I play tennis.
- How about we get together?

764
01:32:39,893 --> 01:32:42,604
Next week?
Hour before we start work?

765
01:32:50,904 --> 01:32:52,656
- Jack?
- Yeah.

766
01:32:53,866 --> 01:32:56,410
Computer theft is a serious crime.

767
01:33:00,873 --> 01:33:03,667
So are crimes
against the Constitution.

768
01:33:05,878 --> 01:33:07,629
Son of a bitch!

769
01:33:19,933 --> 01:33:21,685
Son of a bitch!

770
01:33:25,939 --> 01:33:27,774
Come on, come on.

771
01:34:08,982 --> 01:34:11,068
You'll go to jail, pal.

772
01:34:11,985 --> 01:34:15,072
What is that? What do you think
you have there?

773
01:34:15,948 --> 01:34:17,825
You broke the law.

774
01:34:18,951 --> 01:34:21,119
You are such a Boy Scout.

775
01:34:22,955 --> 01:34:25,958
Look at you. You see everything
in black and white.

776
01:34:25,958 --> 01:34:29,169
No, not black and white, Ritter.
Right and wrong!

777
01:34:30,963 --> 01:34:34,550
- You see! There you go again.
- Why was I kept out of it?

778
01:34:36,009 --> 01:34:39,012
You're neck deep in it.
You went before Congress.

779
01:34:39,012 --> 01:34:42,015
You got the money for it.
You lied under oath...

780
01:34:42,015 --> 01:34:45,435
- I never lied to Congress!
- You told them no troops.

781
01:34:47,020 --> 01:34:50,023
- There are troops!
- You know I didn't know that.

782
01:34:50,023 --> 01:34:54,111
No. I have no recollection of that.
That's the term you have to learn.

783
01:34:56,029 --> 01:34:59,324
- Who authorised this?
- Sure, they'll ask you that.

784
01:34:59,992 --> 01:35:03,579
- Who authorised this?
- I have no recollection...Senator.

785
01:35:10,002 --> 01:35:13,630
I did not sign up for somebody's
bullshit political agenda.

786
01:35:15,007 --> 01:35:17,301
Who authorised this? Cutter?

787
01:35:19,052 --> 01:35:22,264
Cutter couldn't tie his shoes
without permission.

788
01:35:27,060 --> 01:35:30,063
- If I go down, you go down with me.
- Wrong again.

789
01:35:30,063 --> 01:35:33,400
I have an autographed
"Get Out of Jail Free" card.

790
01:35:36,069 --> 01:35:40,032
"The President authorises the Deputy
Director CIA Robert Ritter" -

791
01:35:41,033 --> 01:35:45,162
- "to conduct Operation Reciprocity
including all support necessary."

792
01:35:46,038 --> 01:35:50,334
"This operation is deemed important
to the national security of the U.S."

793
01:35:55,047 --> 01:35:57,966
You don't have one of these,
do you, Jack?

794
01:36:08,101 --> 01:36:10,437
Grey! The world's grey, Jack!

795
01:36:46,140 --> 01:36:49,518
You have any idea how I'm gonna
get out of this mess?

796
01:36:51,145 --> 01:36:52,938
Absolutely none.

797
01:37:02,114 --> 01:37:03,949
Yeah. This is he.

798
01:37:10,122 --> 01:37:11,456
When?

799
01:37:17,129 --> 01:37:18,505
James?

800
01:37:20,132 --> 01:37:21,675
Thank you.

801
01:37:23,177 --> 01:37:27,139
Admiral James Greer devoted his life
to his country and his family.

802
01:37:31,185 --> 01:37:34,438
Giving selflessly
of both his wisdom and his love.

803
01:37:36,190 --> 01:37:39,234
He served his country
for more than 50 years.

804
01:37:40,194 --> 01:37:43,780
Enlisting in the Navy at 1 7.
Graduating from the Academy.

805
01:37:45,157 --> 01:37:47,743
Achieving three stars for his flag.

806
01:37:49,161 --> 01:37:52,706
He lived through tumultuous events
in his country's life.

807
01:37:53,165 --> 01:37:57,085
He participated in them. He made
them clearer to the rest of us, -

808
01:37:57,169 --> 01:38:01,048
- with his knowledge, his honesty,
his integrity and his courage.

809
01:38:13,227 --> 01:38:15,229
I can't see them,
but I know they're there.

810
01:38:15,229 --> 01:38:18,232
Five kilometres due east
from your position.

811
01:38:24,238 --> 01:38:26,949
Keep pushing forward.
We'll trap them.

812
01:38:27,199 --> 01:38:30,452
Never was he deluded
into thinking that one man...

813
01:38:31,203 --> 01:38:33,789
...can solve the ills of the world.

814
01:38:34,206 --> 01:38:38,335
Always the soldier, on the battle
fields of the South Pacific, Korea...

815
01:38:39,211 --> 01:38:42,756
...Vietnam and Washington,
he fought as part of a unit...

816
01:38:44,216 --> 01:38:48,053
-... to preserve the ideals...
- Knife, this is Variable, over.

817
01:38:48,262 --> 01:38:51,557
- ...ofhis nation.
- Knife! This is Variable. Over.

818
01:38:54,268 --> 01:38:57,729
To the refuge ofthe earth
we entrust our fri. d's body.

819
01:38:59,273 --> 01:39:02,901
To the protection of our God
in Heaven we entrust his soul.

820
01:39:03,277 --> 01:39:05,946
To ourselves we entrust his spirit...

821
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:10,784
...and the principles he lived by.

822
01:39:12,244 --> 01:39:14,538
We're gonna miss you, James.

823
01:39:36,310 --> 01:39:38,687
Variable, this is Knife, over.

824
01:39:39,313 --> 01:39:41,690
Variable, this is Knife, over.

825
01:39:43,317 --> 01:39:46,320
Variable, I am not receiving.
We are under heavy attack.

826
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:48,405
Need air support, over.

827
01:40:11,345 --> 01:40:14,097
Variable, this is Knife, over!
Switch!

828
01:40:47,339 --> 01:40:50,551
Variable, this is Knife!
Where the hell are you?!

829
01:41:13,365 --> 01:41:16,535
On behaIf of a grateful nation,
our condolences.

830
01:41:17,369 --> 01:41:20,330
- He was a very great patriot.
- Thank you.

831
01:41:59,411 --> 01:42:02,247
- Hello?
- Jean Fowler for Dr Jack Ryan.

832
01:42:04,416 --> 01:42:06,794
Jack? You've got to hear this.

833
01:42:07,419 --> 01:42:09,630
Picked it up this morning.

834
01:42:10,422 --> 01:42:14,009
Variable, this is Knife e e
under attack, need air support

835
01:42:16,470 --> 01:42:19,640
Variable, this is Knife
where the hell are you?!

836
01:42:20,474 --> 01:42:23,393
Jack, what do you want me
to do with this?

837
01:42:24,478 --> 01:42:27,105
Make a copy, Jean.
Make ten copies.

838
01:42:29,483 --> 01:42:32,444
Get them to me
as quick as you can. Thanks.

839
01:42:34,488 --> 01:42:37,783
Jesus. They're going to leave
those guys down there.

840
01:43:21,493 --> 01:43:24,788
He's on American 91 5.
He'll be in Bogota 7.50 p.m.

841
01:43:40,554 --> 01:43:42,556
-Yeah?
- It's Ritt er.

842
01:43:42,556 --> 01:43:45,893
- Where the fuck have you been?
- We have a problem.

843
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:49,563
We've got a disaster!
I can't get through to my men.

844
01:43:49,563 --> 01:43:52,357
We had to shut down
the satellite link.

845
01:43:54,568 --> 01:43:56,862
- Clark?
- You had to what?

846
01:43:58,572 --> 01:44:02,534
It's Ryan. He found out everything.
He threatened to tell Congress -

847
01:44:05,537 --> 01:44:08,248
-ifwe didn't
shut down the operation.

848
01:44:08,540 --> 01:44:12,628
OK. It's shut down. Just give me
some air and my men are out of there.

849
01:44:15,547 --> 01:44:19,676
Clark, maybe you're not hearing me.
There is no air. We are shut down.

850
01:44:23,597 --> 01:44:26,099
I'm on a plane.
I'm gonna kill m

851
01:44:28,602 --> 01:44:30,103
Ritt er?!

852
01:44:32,606 --> 01:44:34,525
He's coming to you.

853
01:44:34,608 --> 01:44:37,569
American Airlin at 19.50
with no security .

854
01:44:38,612 --> 01:44:41,824
- Who is this?
- National Security Advisor Cutter.

855
01:44:43,575 --> 01:44:46,286
Once Ryan's gone,
we're back on line.

856
01:44:46,578 --> 01:44:48,330
You understand?

857
01:44:49,581 --> 01:44:51,083
Yes, sir.

858
01:46:13,665 --> 01:46:14,666
Clark...

859
01:46:14,666 --> 01:46:16,668
- Jesus!
- Get in the van.

860
01:46:16,668 --> 01:46:20,339
- Don't do this, I came to find you.
- You found me. Get in.

861
01:46:25,719 --> 01:46:27,554
Behind the wheel.

862
01:46:28,722 --> 01:46:30,182
Clark...

863
01:46:31,725 --> 01:46:33,101
Drive.

864
01:47:00,712 --> 01:47:02,881
- Ritter.
- Ryan's dead.

865
01:47:04,716 --> 01:47:06,009
How?

866
01:47:07,761 --> 01:47:10,639
I killed him.
Turn the satellite back on.

867
01:47:13,767 --> 01:47:17,646
You told me to get rid of Ryan
and we're back in business, right?

868
01:47:43,755 --> 01:47:46,258
What the hell are you doing here?

869
01:47:48,802 --> 01:47:51,555
I came to help you
get those guys out.

870
01:47:53,807 --> 01:47:56,059
What can you do to help me?

871
01:48:01,815 --> 01:48:03,650
What do you need?

872
01:48:04,818 --> 01:48:06,487
A helicopter.

873
01:48:08,822 --> 01:48:10,449
A helicopter.

874
01:48:23,796 --> 01:48:26,799
- ls this "Happy Hour"?
- It's always "Happy Hour".

875
01:48:26,799 --> 01:48:29,927
- Your pilot owns this joint?
- He lives here.

876
01:48:36,850 --> 01:48:38,435
Here he is.

877
01:48:48,862 --> 01:48:51,698
Morning.
I'm here to rent the helicopter.

878
01:48:53,826 --> 01:48:57,162
Sorry, we don't rent it anymore.
But it is for sale.

879
01:48:59,832 --> 01:49:01,583
How much is it?

880
01:49:02,835 --> 01:49:04,795
Two million dollars.

881
01:49:11,885 --> 01:49:14,888
My pilot and I would
have to do a test flight.

882
01:49:14,888 --> 01:49:17,891
Of course.
You just have to leave a deposit.

883
01:49:18,892 --> 01:49:20,727
How much is that?

884
01:49:20,894 --> 01:49:22,855
Two million dollars.

885
01:49:28,902 --> 01:49:31,363
Would you take a company cheque?

886
01:49:37,870 --> 01:49:39,163
Yes.

887
01:49:47,880 --> 01:49:50,966
- Here we go.
- Big son of a bitch, ain't she?

888
01:49:53,927 --> 01:49:57,264
- Do you have any time in this type?
- Nine o'clock.

889
01:50:07,941 --> 01:50:11,278
- Get out of my chopper.
- No. My chopper. Let's go.

890
01:50:34,968 --> 01:50:37,763
Their last communication
put them here.

891
01:50:38,972 --> 01:50:42,309
The closest extraction point is here.
In this gorge.

892
01:50:44,978 --> 01:50:46,480
I got it.

893
01:51:06,959 --> 01:51:09,586
- ls that a body down there?
- Yes.

894
01:51:11,964 --> 01:51:14,341
- One of ours?
- One of mine.

895
01:51:19,012 --> 01:51:22,516
Find a place to set her down.
We'll look for the others.

896
01:52:07,060 --> 01:52:09,730
Nowhere to run to.
No place to hide.

897
01:52:12,065 --> 01:52:15,402
Blood trails everywhere.
They all lead to the river.

898
01:52:30,042 --> 01:52:32,878
These are the falls
we saw from the air.

899
01:52:50,103 --> 01:52:53,273
You left us!
You left us with no support at all!

900
01:52:56,109 --> 01:52:59,071
You left us out to dry!
You son of a bitch!

901
01:53:03,075 --> 01:53:05,994
- It's not his fault.
- Whose fauIt is it?

902
01:53:08,080 --> 01:53:09,790
It's my fault.

903
01:53:15,087 --> 01:53:16,797
It's my fault.

904
01:53:29,143 --> 01:53:32,020
I was on point
when the last attack came.

905
01:53:34,148 --> 01:53:35,983
Over a mile away.

906
01:53:38,152 --> 01:53:40,737
By the time I got back it was over.

907
01:53:41,155 --> 01:53:43,615
They were taking the Captain Oso.

908
01:53:46,118 --> 01:53:47,703
The others?

909
01:53:48,120 --> 01:53:49,830
I buried them.

910
01:54:01,133 --> 01:54:04,386
They loaded the prisoners here.
Blood everywhere.

911
01:54:05,179 --> 01:54:08,390
- God knows where they are now.
- Escobedo knows.

912
01:54:09,183 --> 01:54:12,186
What are you going to do?
Knock on his door?

913
01:54:18,192 --> 01:54:22,070
Morning. I'd like to see Ernesto
Escobedo. I have no appointment.

914
01:54:24,198 --> 01:54:25,699
Thank you.

915
01:54:36,168 --> 01:54:37,419
OK.

916
01:54:40,172 --> 01:54:41,673
Hands up.

917
01:54:43,175 --> 01:54:44,676
Hands up!

918
01:54:46,220 --> 01:54:47,638
Wallet.

919
01:54:53,227 --> 01:54:55,229
It's a tape recorder.

920
01:55:00,234 --> 01:55:01,693
He's in.

921
01:55:05,239 --> 01:55:07,533
Bird, this is Variable, over.

922
01:55:10,202 --> 01:55:12,538
Bird, this is Variable, over.

923
01:55:30,264 --> 01:55:32,182
Dr Ryan... Come in.

924
01:55:47,281 --> 01:55:49,741
Sit down.
What can I do for you?

925
01:55:52,244 --> 01:55:55,581
I didn't know who else to turn to.
I have a problem.

926
01:55:59,251 --> 01:56:02,796
An associate of mine, a coffee buyer
and his assistant, -

927
01:56:03,255 --> 01:56:06,049
- were on a business trip
in this area.

928
01:56:06,258 --> 01:56:09,428
They disappeared yesterday.
I'm very concerned.

929
01:56:10,304 --> 01:56:11,972
Coffee buyer?

930
01:56:13,307 --> 01:56:15,309
It's very important to me
to find them.

931
01:56:15,309 --> 01:56:18,437
Coffee buying is becoming
a dangerous business.

932
01:56:20,314 --> 01:56:22,900
Yes. Well, it was for Peter Hardin.

933
01:56:28,322 --> 01:56:31,158
- Who?
- He was a client of Lindo Coffee.

934
01:56:31,283 --> 01:56:35,245
- Lindo Coffee has many clients.
- You must have heard of this one.

935
01:56:37,289 --> 01:56:40,250
He owed your company
a great deal of money.

936
01:56:40,292 --> 01:56:43,253
I'lI have to talk to accounting
about that.

937
01:56:46,298 --> 01:56:48,258
650 million dollars.

938
01:56:51,345 --> 01:56:52,930
And change.

939
01:56:55,349 --> 01:56:59,269
Are you offering to help me with
the collection of an unpaid debt?

940
01:57:00,354 --> 01:57:02,773
- No.
- What are you offering?

941
01:57:05,359 --> 01:57:08,153
A trade.
Felix Cortez has sold you out.

942
01:57:10,364 --> 01:57:14,034
He will murder you and your family,
and take over the cartel.

943
01:57:14,326 --> 01:57:16,495
Where's my tape recorder?

944
01:57:23,335 --> 01:57:25,045
Play the tape.

945
01:57:58,370 --> 01:57:59,955
Let's move.

946
01:58:30,444 --> 01:58:33,447
I'd like you to meet
my new friend, Dr Ryan.

947
01:58:33,447 --> 01:58:35,949
"Doctor"? Why? ls somebody sick?

948
01:58:50,422 --> 01:58:52,299
What does he want?

949
01:58:54,426 --> 01:58:57,012
The safe return of his associates.

950
01:58:57,471 --> 01:59:00,098
And what does he offer us in return?

951
01:59:02,476 --> 01:59:03,769
You.

952
01:59:10,484 --> 01:59:14,238
Whatever this man has told you
is a lie. He lies for a living.

953
01:59:14,488 --> 01:59:18,575
He's in the intelligence business.
You're in the intelligence business!

954
01:59:26,458 --> 01:59:29,211
You've taken care of
the litt le fish.

955
01:59:29,461 --> 01:59:31,463
I'll take care of
the one that got away.

956
01:59:31,463 --> 01:59:34,967
Once Escobedo is gone,
I'll be in a positi. to help you.

957
01:59:36,468 --> 01:59:38,554
So, the question is...

958
01:59:42,516 --> 01:59:45,185
...what am I supposed to do with you?

959
01:59:48,522 --> 01:59:51,650
I guess I'm supposed to
kill you with this bat!

960
01:59:59,491 --> 02:00:00,909
Get up.

961
02:00:06,498 --> 02:00:10,085
Dramatic seizures. Drastic
reductions, no more violence...

962
02:00:11,503 --> 02:00:13,672
You'lI have your victory.

963
02:00:14,506 --> 02:00:16,425
In return for what?

964
02:00:57,549 --> 02:01:00,052
- Where are they?
-They're here.

965
02:01:01,595 --> 02:01:04,348
The American killed Ernesto!
Let's go!

966
02:01:53,647 --> 02:01:55,732
Bird to Variable. Over.

967
02:02:09,621 --> 02:02:12,791
Bird, this is Variable.
Where the hell are you?!

968
02:02:14,626 --> 02:02:17,963
I'm cruising about five klicks
south of the village.

969
02:02:18,630 --> 02:02:21,842
- Stay there. I'll get back to you.
- Roger that,

970
02:02:34,688 --> 02:02:36,940
- No one.
- The prisoners!

971
02:03:23,737 --> 02:03:26,114
Come on, guys.
Let's go, son.

972
02:03:28,700 --> 02:03:30,786
We're going home, boys.

973
02:04:43,817 --> 02:04:46,612
Pick us up
at the Lindo Coffee factory.

974
02:06:22,875 --> 02:06:26,545
Not only can I expose you
to the press, so can the soldiers.

975
02:06:27,880 --> 02:06:31,842
Do you want to take your chances
with the courts and the reporters?

976
02:06:33,886 --> 02:06:37,389
To end the polit ical career
ofyour commander-in-chief?

977
02:07:22,976 --> 02:07:24,478
Let's go!

978
02:07:51,964 --> 02:07:55,050
Get your asses in here!
Come on, we got to go!

979
02:07:59,012 --> 02:08:00,472
Come on!

980
02:08:08,021 --> 02:08:10,023
Hold it! We wait for Ryan!

981
02:08:10,023 --> 02:08:12,151
Yeah? We're out of here!

982
02:08:19,992 --> 02:08:22,327
Set it down! He's down there!

983
02:08:35,007 --> 02:08:36,467
Come on!

984
02:08:56,069 --> 02:08:57,738
I've got you!

985
02:09:04,036 --> 02:09:05,871
Chavez, cover me!

986
02:09:16,048 --> 02:09:18,383
Your hand. Give me your hand!

987
02:10:24,116 --> 02:10:26,535
The President wilI see you now.

988
02:10:40,132 --> 02:10:42,384
Jack! I'm glad you're here.

989
02:10:44,136 --> 02:10:46,722
Sit down.
Can I get you anything?

990
02:10:48,182 --> 02:10:49,433
No.

991
02:10:51,185 --> 02:10:54,521
- Come on, sit down.
- I would prefer to stand, sir.

992
02:10:57,191 --> 02:11:00,944
Some things have gone on here
that I'm just becoming aware of.

993
02:11:04,198 --> 02:11:07,743
I was kept in the dark, as you were,
for a very long time.

994
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:10,454
- Troubling things.
- Yeah.

995
02:11:12,164 --> 02:11:16,168
Now we have to sort them out, figure
out who's responsible for what.

996
02:11:16,168 --> 02:11:19,797
And what to do about it.
And we have to do it delicately, -

997
02:11:20,172 --> 02:11:23,175
- otherwise people might
get the wrong idea.

998
02:11:24,176 --> 02:11:25,928
We have to lie.

999
02:11:27,221 --> 02:11:29,848
- Did I say that?
- No, you didn't.

1000
02:11:32,226 --> 02:11:34,561
- You're upset.
- I'm upset.

1001
02:11:36,230 --> 02:11:40,025
It's understandable. Do you mind
if I give you a bit of advice?

1002
02:11:42,236 --> 02:11:44,238
You know this, you're smart.

1003
02:11:44,238 --> 02:11:47,449
Never make important decisions
while you're upset.

1004
02:11:48,200 --> 02:11:52,037
You did. American soldiers and
civilians are dead because of it.

1005
02:11:54,206 --> 02:11:57,876
- I never ordered any...
- Don't you play that game with me!

1006
02:11:58,210 --> 02:12:02,089
Don't you dishonour their memories
by pretending you didn't know!

1007
02:12:02,214 --> 02:12:05,342
- How dare you lecture...
- How dare you, sir?!

1008
02:12:07,219 --> 02:12:10,848
How dare you come here
and bark at me like a junkyard dog!

1009
02:12:11,265 --> 02:12:14,101
I am the President
of the United States!

1010
02:12:17,271 --> 02:12:20,023
lt gives me no pleasure
to do it, sir.

1011
02:12:21,275 --> 02:12:24,820
As acting Deputy Director
of lntelligence it is my duty -

1012
02:12:25,279 --> 02:12:28,866
- to report this matter
to the Senate Oversight Committee.

1013
02:12:34,246 --> 02:12:37,124
- You're not going to do that.
- I'm not?

1014
02:12:42,254 --> 02:12:45,382
You've got yourself
a chip in the big game now.

1015
02:12:47,259 --> 02:12:51,388
You're going to save that for a time
when your own ass is on the line.

1016
02:12:52,306 --> 02:12:54,975
And then you're going to pull it out.

1017
02:12:56,310 --> 02:12:59,271
And I'm going to cash it in for you.
Right?

1018
02:13:03,317 --> 02:13:06,737
I don't think I have anything more
to say to you, sir.

1019
02:13:07,321 --> 02:13:11,283
The country can't afford another
scandal, Jack. To protect itseIf -

1020
02:13:13,285 --> 02:13:17,289
- it won't allow another deception
that goes all the way to the top.

1021
02:13:19,291 --> 02:13:23,045
You'll take the blame. Cutter
and Ritter will take some too, -

1022
02:13:23,295 --> 02:13:26,298
- but it will only amount to
a slap on the wrist.

1023
02:13:26,298 --> 02:13:29,593
Then 20,000 dollars an hour
on the lecture circuit.

1024
02:13:32,346 --> 02:13:35,224
The rest of the blame
will fall on Greer.

1025
02:13:36,350 --> 02:13:39,144
Oh yeah, you'll take him
down with you.

1026
02:13:40,354 --> 02:13:42,356
You'll destroy his reputation.

1027
02:13:42,356 --> 02:13:46,193
But that's as far as it will go.
The old Potomac two-step, Jack.

1028
02:13:51,365 --> 02:13:54,118
I'm sorry, Mr President,
I don't dance.

1029
02:14:18,392 --> 02:14:20,394
Ryan, have you got a minute?

1030
02:14:20,394 --> 02:14:21,645
No.

1031
02:14:23,397 --> 02:14:25,190
We need to talk!

1032
02:14:26,400 --> 02:14:27,734
Ryan!

1033
02:14:52,384 --> 02:14:56,221
The Committ ee will me to order.
The chair will w call Dr Ryan.

1034
02:15:19,411 --> 02:15:23,081
Dr Ryan, thank you for appearing
before the Committee today.

1035
02:15:25,417 --> 02:15:28,212
Please stand
and raise your right hand.

1036
02:15:32,424 --> 02:15:36,220
Do you solemnly swear that
the testimony you're about to give -

1037
02:15:37,471 --> 02:15:41,308
- is the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

1038
02:15:44,478 --> 02:15:45,813
I do.

1039
02:15:47,481 --> 02:15:51,318
Dr Ryan, you may consider yourself
under oath. Please be seated.

1040
02:20:56,748 --> 02:20:59,001

lt was not easy for us.

1046
02:22:18,497 --> 02:22:20,207
Rojas, Diaz...

1047
02:22:25,462 --> 02:22:26,463
What the hell is this?

1048
02:22:26,463 --> 02:22:28,507
What the hell is this?

1049
02:22:31,468 --> 02:22:33,429
My new toy. Like it?

1050
02:22:35,472 --> 02:22:37,141
You see this?

1051
02:22:37,474 --> 02:22:40,769
That's your new target,
unless it's not big enough.

1052
02:22:47,526 --> 02:22:50,696
Variable, this is Easy Rhino.
Do you copy? Over.

Target is lit.

1056
02:23:07,505 --> 02:23:09,298
Start the music.

1057
02:23:10,508 --> 02:23:12,134
Into attack.

1058

Pickle's hot, Target is acquired
and lit . Coming down.

1059
02:23:22,520 --> 02:23:25,481
Fernandez, Vega...
Looks like a full house.

1060
02:23:38,577 --> 02:23:41,330
Damn it!
Why doesn't he fix this road?

1061
02:23:42,581 --> 02:23:45,000
Shit! Thought we had everybody.

1062
02:23:46,585 --> 02:23:48,671
Keep the target painted.

1063
02:24:17,616 --> 02:24:18,909
Sir?

1064
02:24:24,623 --> 02:24:25,958
Boom.

him talking to a Cali cartel subject.

1072
02:25:25,643 --> 02:25:29,021
I'll fax what I've got.
If he shows, pick him up, ok?

1073
02:25:30,648 --> 02:25:33,859
- You know I can't do that,
- I mean the police.

1074
02:25:34,693 --> 02:25:38,239
The Colombian police don't pick up
members of the cartel.

1075
02:25:39,698 --> 02:25:43,160
Unless they've got a death wish.
You've been down here.

1076
02:25:43,702 --> 02:25:45,412
Wait a minute.

1077
02:25:45,704 --> 02:25:48,707
Oh Jesus...
Jack, something's happened here.

1078
02:26:02,680 --> 02:26:06,350
At least 30 people were kill ,
including women and children.

1079
02:26:07,685 --> 02:26:11,272
The bomb exploded in a car
belonging to a Rojas associate.

1080
02:26:11,689 --> 02:26:14,567
- Jack..?
- Yeah, are you watching this?

1081
02:26:15,734 --> 02:26:18,362
- Did this just happen?
- Just now.

1082
02:26:21,740 --> 02:26:25,661
Send me all the stuff, and we'll
put a tail on him if we spot him.

1083
02:26:26,745 --> 02:26:29,331
Ifhe's still live.
I've got to go.

1084
02:26:34,712 --> 02:26:37,715
- A surgical strike, you said.
- lt was perfect.

1085
02:26:37,715 --> 02:26:41,427
- That's a dead kid. On NBC.
- Take the gloves off, you said.

1086
02:26:42,720 --> 02:26:45,723
- I know what I said.
- A bit late to change your mind.

1087
02:26:45,723 --> 02:26:47,892
I'm not changing my mind.

1088
02:26:49,727 --> 02:26:53,022
I hadn't counted on
this kind of collateral damage.

1089
02:26:54,773 --> 02:26:57,776
- Neither had he.
- lt will be interpreted as I said.

1090
02:26:57,776 --> 02:27:00,863
Rivalry that ended
in the blast of a car bomb.

1091
02:27:01,780 --> 02:27:03,365
Good night.

1092
02:27:18,756 --> 02:27:22,259
- Morning, Rose. Finish the report?
- Hot off the press.

1093
02:27:24,762 --> 02:27:28,057
Could any of the bombing victims'
names be aliases?

1094
02:27:29,767 --> 02:27:33,395
No. All I.D.'s have been confirmed.
Who are you hoping for?

1095
02:27:34,772 --> 02:27:38,275
If he's not here, he's not here.
Cortez. He's not here.

1096
02:27:40,819 --> 02:27:44,448
- Why was Operations copied on this?
- Ritter requested it.

1097
02:27:45,824 --> 02:27:48,369
Ritter?
You look very nice today.

1098
02:27:49,828 --> 02:27:51,372
Thank you.

1099
02:28:05,803 --> 02:28:07,388
Car bomb...

1100
02:28:16,814 --> 02:28:19,608
What happens
when a car bomb goes off?

1101
02:28:19,859 --> 02:28:22,570
- lt explodes.
- lt blows up and out?

1102
02:28:23,863 --> 02:28:25,573
And a missile?

1103
02:28:29,869 --> 02:28:32,872
- This deeper crater?
- That's characteristic.

1104
02:28:32,872 --> 02:28:35,207
Bring up the satellite photo.

1105
02:28:40,838 --> 02:28:42,464
HMX and TNT.

1106
02:28:44,842 --> 02:28:48,262
When you mix it 70-30
you get a compound called Octol.

1107
02:28:48,846 --> 02:28:51,849
Enough explosives in a car
give a crater that big.

1108
02:28:51,849 --> 02:28:55,853
- It's very stable. Very expensive.
- Would it still be in the crater?

1109
02:28:55,853 --> 02:28:59,148
- Very violent,
- There would be pieces all around.

1110
02:28:59,899 --> 02:29:03,444
- Where is Octol made?
- Lots of places. Europe. The U.S.

1111
02:29:06,906 --> 02:29:10,618
But nobody uses it. Nobody can
afford it except the military.

1112
02:29:11,911 --> 02:29:15,581
An aerial bomb would do that.
But that's not an aerial bomb.

1113
02:29:18,918 --> 02:29:22,046
There is also
a cellulose residue on everything.

1114
02:29:22,880 --> 02:29:25,716
There should be shrapnel.
Here and here.

1115
02:29:25,883 --> 02:29:28,677
- But there isn't.
- No bomb fragments.

1116
02:30:13,931 --> 02:30:16,851
"Cellulose encased
laser-guided bomb"...

1117
02:30:20,938 --> 02:30:22,314
Paper.

1118
02:30:25,985 --> 02:30:28,070
The Americans are here.

1119
02:30:57,975 --> 02:31:01,729
"We have something in common.
Neither can implementpolicy" -

1120
02:31:02,980 --> 02:31:06,358
- "without tacit authoris ion
from our employer. "

1121
02:31:07,026 --> 02:31:10,946
"We also both know that there are
American troops in Colombia" -

1122
02:31:12,031 --> 02:31:14,366
- "fig ing an ill al war. "

1123
02:31:16,035 --> 02:31:19,830
"I will at Hotel Paloma de Oro
in Panama City on Wednesday. "

1124
02:31:22,041 --> 02:31:24,126
"I suggest we meet, "

1125
02:32:15,052 --> 02:32:17,680
- 6, this is Point, Over.
- 6 here.

1126
02:32:21,058 --> 02:32:25,271
The stuff's here, a lot of it. I'm also
looking at 1 00-1 50 men, armed -

1127
02:32:28,065 --> 02:32:30,776
- waiting around for something. Over.

1128
02:32:31,110 --> 02:32:33,112
Colombian Army? Over.

1129
02:32:38,117 --> 02:32:40,828
Negative.
They look like mercenaries.

1130
02:32:41,120 --> 02:32:43,956
All right. Get back here.
Abort mission.

1131
02:32:45,124 --> 02:32:47,585
I say again, abort mission. Out.

1132
02:32:49,128 --> 02:32:50,838
1 50 armed men?

1133
02:33:13,152 --> 02:33:15,279
Raise your arms, please.

1134
02:33:30,169 --> 02:33:33,506
Thank you for responding to my note.
And so promptly.

1135
02:33:35,132 --> 02:33:38,302
I had nothing to do
with the death of Mr Jacobs.

1136
02:33:39,136 --> 02:33:42,848
lt was an act of madness.
But typical for the men I work for.

1137
02:33:46,143 --> 02:33:49,355
- What do you want?
- Same as you. Mineral water.

1138
02:33:51,148 --> 02:33:55,152
You agree that as long as Americans
want drugs, they will supplied?

1139
02:33:56,195 --> 02:33:59,198
I don't want to be here
longer than I have to.

1140
02:33:59,198 --> 02:34:02,201
You mentioned a gang war.
What does that mean?

1141
02:34:02,201 --> 02:34:05,037
- That we want the same thing.
- Really?

1142
02:34:07,206 --> 02:34:11,293
So far you've done all the work.
You've taken care of the little fish.

1143
02:34:12,211 --> 02:34:15,089
I will take care of
the one that got away.

1144
02:34:15,172 --> 02:34:18,801
Once Escobedo is gone,
I will be in a position to help you.

1145
02:34:20,177 --> 02:34:23,472
- You want to help me?
- Your country. Your people.

1146
02:34:24,181 --> 02:34:27,434
By restructuring the drug trade.
By regulating it.

1147
02:34:30,187 --> 02:34:34,275
What'd you say if I said I'd halve
the cocaine shipments to the U.S.?

1148
02:34:38,237 --> 02:34:41,490
I'd say you'd been using
too much of your product.

1149
02:34:42,241 --> 02:34:45,619
I can also give you regular quotas
on major arrests -

1150
02:34:46,245 --> 02:34:49,039
- that your police
can take credit for.

1151
02:34:49,248 --> 02:34:52,376
lmagine. Dramatic seizures.
Drastic reductions.

1152
02:34:53,252 --> 02:34:56,589
No more senseless violence.
You'lI have your victory.

1153
02:35:02,219 --> 02:35:04,138
In return for what?

1154
02:35:05,222 --> 02:35:08,267
I also need a victory,
to establis ypositi. -

1155
02:35:09,226 --> 02:35:12,563
- with what is left ofthe cartel,
so I can help you.

1156
02:35:14,231 --> 02:35:18,068
I need to defeat those soldiers
blowing up everything they see.

1157
02:35:20,279 --> 02:35:24,033
Give me maps of their locations.
Cut off their communications.

1158
02:35:32,291 --> 02:35:36,128
DEA's sending the audio surveillance
tape. I haven't got it yet.

1159
02:35:40,257 --> 02:35:43,761
You know what you think about...
when you're lying here?

1160
02:35:47,264 --> 02:35:50,226
You know you're gonna die,
and you think...

1161
02:35:52,269 --> 02:35:55,231
...that's all right.
You lived a long time.

1162
02:35:57,316 --> 02:35:59,318
You had a family that loved you.

1163
02:35:59,318 --> 02:36:02,530
You had a job that you thought
made a difference.

1164
02:36:04,323 --> 02:36:06,784
That you thought was honourable.

1165
02:36:08,327 --> 02:36:10,371
And then you see this.

1166
02:36:15,334 --> 02:36:17,837
I'm afraid if I dig any deeper...

1167
02:36:19,296 --> 02:36:21,882
...no one's gonna like what I find.

1168
02:36:27,304 --> 02:36:29,223
You took an oath...

1169
02:36:31,308 --> 02:36:33,227
...if you recall...

1170
02:36:36,313 --> 02:36:39,108
...when you first came
to work for me.

1171
02:36:40,359 --> 02:36:44,071
And I don't mean to the National
Security Advisor of the U.S.

1172
02:36:46,365 --> 02:36:48,284
I mean to his boss.

1173
02:36:50,369 --> 02:36:52,788
And I don't mean the President.

1174
02:36:54,373 --> 02:36:56,500
You gave your word to...

1175
02:36:59,378 --> 02:37:00,963
...his boss.

1176
02:37:02,339 --> 02:37:04,341
You gave your word...

1177
02:37:04,341 --> 02:37:07,094
...to the people
of the United States.

1178
02:37:10,347 --> 02:37:12,516
Your word is who you are.

1179
02:37:18,355 --> 02:37:20,733
What else have you got there?

1180
02:37:26,405 --> 02:37:28,908
I brought you some new magazines.

1181
02:37:39,418 --> 02:37:43,380
The situation in East Timor seems
to have stabilised during the day.

1182
02:37:45,382 --> 02:37:48,344
- ls that it?
- Except for the other thing.

1183
02:37:50,387 --> 02:37:53,390
We've accomplished a lot,
we're seeing tangible results.

1184
02:37:53,390 --> 02:37:56,852
Drug shipments are down.
Price on the street is rising.

1185
02:37:57,394 --> 02:38:01,065
The administration is perceived
to be doing something right.

1186
02:38:02,441 --> 02:38:04,401
What's the bad news?

1187
02:38:06,445 --> 02:38:10,699
I'm worried about the car bomb coming
so soon after Jacobs' assassination.

1188
02:38:14,453 --> 02:38:17,373
Just the kind of thing
reporters live for.

1189
02:38:17,456 --> 02:38:21,210
- They'd love to make a connection.
- And you think they will?

1190
02:38:22,461 --> 02:38:25,422
I think it's time
the whole thing went away.

1191
02:38:27,424 --> 02:38:30,302
- If that's what you think.
- I think so.

1192
02:38:32,429 --> 02:38:35,349
Then it should go away.
lt never happened.

1193
02:38:43,440 --> 02:38:45,192
It's possible.

1194
02:38:45,484 --> 02:38:49,572
lt would be easier if you told me
whose system you want to break into.

1195
02:38:50,489 --> 02:38:52,908
- Morning, Dr Ryan.
- Morning.

1196
02:39:12,469 --> 02:39:14,889
We're way beyond birthdays now.

1197
02:39:18,475 --> 02:39:21,687
I'm gonna have to write
a special programme here.

1198
02:39:33,532 --> 02:39:36,076
OK, sweetheart, let's get to work.

1199
02:39:38,537 --> 02:39:40,122
Fine, good.

1200
02:39:41,540 --> 02:39:43,417
Yes... Here we go.

1201
02:40:42,560 --> 02:40:44,728
Reciprocity. What's that?

1202
02:40:58,617 --> 02:41:01,620
I forgot to tell you,
after you get the code, -

1203
02:41:01,620 --> 02:41:05,499
- wait until he's off his system
before you log on. He will know.

1204
02:41:06,625 --> 02:41:08,919
Jesus, Petey, it's too late.

1205
02:41:09,628 --> 02:41:11,213
Oh my God...

1206
02:41:42,661 --> 02:41:44,163
Cutter...

1207
02:41:58,636 --> 02:42:01,639
- Bob, Jack Ryan here.
- Good morning, Jack.

1208
02:42:03,641 --> 02:42:06,477
Listen, maybe we got off
to a bad start.

1209
02:42:08,646 --> 02:42:12,483
If we're gonna work together,
we should get to know each other.

1210
02:42:12,691 --> 02:42:15,819
Do you play tennis?
Tennis? Do you play tennis?

1211
02:42:17,696 --> 02:42:20,991
- Yeah, I play tennis.
- How about we get together?

1212
02:42:21,700 --> 02:42:24,411
Next week?
Hour before we start work?

1213
02:42:32,711 --> 02:42:34,463
- Jack?
- Yeah.

1214
02:42:35,673 --> 02:42:38,217
Computer theft is a serious crime.

1215
02:42:42,680 --> 02:42:45,474
So are crimes
against the Constitution.

1216
02:42:47,685 --> 02:42:49,436
Son of a bitch!

1217
02:43:01,740 --> 02:43:03,492
Son of a bitch!

1218
02:43:07,746 --> 02:43:09,582
Come on, come on.

1219
02:43:50,789 --> 02:43:52,875
You'll go to jail, pal.

1220
02:43:53,792 --> 02:43:56,879
What is that? What do you think
you have there?

1221
02:43:57,755 --> 02:43:59,632
You broke the law.

1222
02:44:00,758 --> 02:44:02,927
You are such a Boy Scout.

1223
02:44:04,762 --> 02:44:07,765
Look at you. You see everything
in black and white.

1224
02:44:07,765 --> 02:44:10,976
No, not black and white, Ritter.
Right and wrong!

1225
02:44:12,770 --> 02:44:16,357
- You see! There you go again.
- Why was I kept out of it?

1226
02:44:17,816 --> 02:44:20,819
You're neck deep in it.
You went before Congress.

1227
02:44:20,819 --> 02:44:23,822
You got the money for it.
You lied under oath...

1228
02:44:23,822 --> 02:44:27,243
- I never lied to Congress!
- You told them no troops.

1229
02:44:28,828 --> 02:44:31,831
- There are troops!
- You know I didn't know that.

1230
02:44:31,831 --> 02:44:35,918
No. I have no recollection of that.
That's the term you have to learn.

1231
02:44:37,837 --> 02:44:41,131
- Who authorised this?
- Sure, they'll ask you that.

1232
02:44:41,799 --> 02:44:45,386
- Who authorised this?
- I have no recollection...Senator.

1233
02:44:51,809 --> 02:44:55,437
I did not sign up for somebody's
bullshit political agenda.

1234
02:44:56,814 --> 02:44:59,108
Who authorised this? Cutter?

1235
02:45:00,860 --> 02:45:04,071
Cutter couldn't tie his shoes
without permission.

1236
02:45:08,868 --> 02:45:11,871
- If I go down, you go down with me.
- Wrong again.

1237
02:45:11,871 --> 02:45:15,207
I have an autographed
"Get Out of Jail Free" card.

1238
02:45:17,877 --> 02:45:21,839
"The President authorises the Deputy
Director CIA Robert Ritter" -

1239
02:45:22,840 --> 02:45:26,969
- "to conduct Operation Reciprocity
including all support necessary."

1240
02:45:27,845 --> 02:45:32,141
"This operation is deemed important
to the national security of the U.S."

1241
02:45:36,854 --> 02:45:39,773
You don't have one of these,
do you, Jack?

1242
02:45:49,909 --> 02:45:52,244
Grey! The world's grey, Jack!

1243
02:46:27,947 --> 02:46:31,325
You have any idea how I'm gonna
get out of this mess?

1244
02:46:32,952 --> 02:46:34,745
Absolutely none.

1245
02:46:43,921 --> 02:46:45,756
Yeah. This is he.

1246
02:46:51,929 --> 02:46:53,264
When?

1247
02:46:58,936 --> 02:47:00,312
James?

1248
02:47:01,939 --> 02:47:03,482
Thank you.

1249
02:47:04,984 --> 02:47:08,946
Admiral James Greer devoted his life
to his country and his family.

1250
02:47:12,992 --> 02:47:16,245
Giving selflessly
of both his wisdom and his love.

1251
02:47:17,997 --> 02:47:21,041
He served his country
for more than 50 years.

1252
02:47:22,001 --> 02:47:25,588
Enlisting in the Navy at 1 7.
Graduating from the Academy.

1253
02:47:26,964 --> 02:47:29,550
Achieving three stars for his flag.

1254
02:47:30,968 --> 02:47:34,513
He lived through tumultuous events
in his country's life.

1255
02:47:34,972 --> 02:47:38,893
He participated in them. He made
them clearer to the rest of us, -

1256
02:47:38,976 --> 02:47:42,855
- with his knowledge, his honesty,
his integrity and his courage.

1257
02:47:55,034 --> 02:47:57,036
I can't see them,
but I know they're there.

1258
02:47:57,036 --> 02:48:00,039
Five kilometres due east
from your position.

1259
02:48:06,045 --> 02:48:08,756
Keep pushing forward.
We'll trap them.

1260
02:48:09,006 --> 02:48:12,259
Never was he deluded
into thinking that one man...

1261
02:48:13,010 --> 02:48:15,596
...can solve the ills of the world.

1262
02:48:16,013 --> 02:48:20,142
Always the soldier, on the battle
fields of the South Pacific, Korea...

1263
02:48:21,018 --> 02:48:24,563
...Vietnam and Washington,
he fought as part of a unit...

1264
02:48:26,023 --> 02:48:29,860
-... to preserve the ideals...
- Knife, this is Variable, over.

1265
02:48:30,069 --> 02:48:33,364
- ...ofhis nation.
- Knife! This is Variable. Over.

1266
02:48:36,075 --> 02:48:39,537
To the refuge ofthe earth
we entrust our fri. d's body.

1267
02:48:41,080 --> 02:48:44,708
To the protection of our God
in Heaven we entrust his soul.

1268
02:48:45,084 --> 02:48:47,753
To ourselves we entrust his spirit...

1269
02:48:50,047 --> 02:48:52,591
...and the principles he lived by.

1270
02:48:54,051 --> 02:48:56,345
We're gonna miss you, James.

1271
02:49:18,117 --> 02:49:20,494
Variable, this is Knife, over.

1272
02:49:21,120 --> 02:49:23,497
Variable, this is Knife, over.

1273
02:49:25,124 --> 02:49:28,127
Variable, I am not receiving.
We are under heavy attack.

1274
02:49:28,127 --> 02:49:30,212
Need air support, over.

1275
02:49:53,152 --> 02:49:55,905
Variable, this is Knife, over!
Switch!

1276
02:50:29,146 --> 02:50:32,358
Variable, this is Knife!
Where the hell are you?!

1277
02:50:55,172 --> 02:50:58,342
On behaIf of a grateful nation,
our condolences.

1278
02:50:59,176 --> 02:51:02,137
- He was a very great patriot.
- Thank you.

1279
02:51:41,218 --> 02:51:44,054
- Hello?
- Jean Fowler for Dr Jack Ryan.

1280
02:51:46,223 --> 02:51:48,601
Jack? You've got to hear this.

1281
02:51:49,226 --> 02:51:51,437
Picked it up this morning.

1282
02:51:52,229 --> 02:51:55,816
Variable, this is Knife e e
under attack, need air support

1283
02:51:58,277 --> 02:52:01,447
Variable, this is Knife
where the hell are you?!

1284
02:52:02,281 --> 02:52:05,201
Jack, what do you want me
to do with this?

1285
02:52:06,285 --> 02:52:08,913
Make a copy, Jean.
Make ten copies.

1286
02:52:11,290 --> 02:52:14,251
Get them to me
as quick as you can. Thanks.

1287
02:52:16,295 --> 02:52:19,590
Jesus. They're going to leave
those guys down there.

1288
02:53:03,300 --> 02:53:06,595
He's on American 91 5.
He'll be in Bogota 7.50 p.m.

1289
02:53:22,361 --> 02:53:24,363
-Yeah?
- It's Ritt er.

1290
02:53:24,363 --> 02:53:27,700
- Where the fuck have you been?
- We have a problem.

1291
02:53:28,367 --> 02:53:31,370
We've got a disaster!
I can't get through to my men.

1292
02:53:31,370 --> 02:53:34,165
We had to shut down
the satellite link.

1293
02:53:36,375 --> 02:53:38,669
- Clark?
- You had to what?

1294
02:53:40,379 --> 02:53:44,341
It's Ryan. He found out everything.
He threatened to tell Congress -

1295
02:53:47,344 --> 02:53:50,055
-ifwe didn't
shut down the operation.

1296
02:53:50,347 --> 02:53:54,435
OK. It's shut down. Just give me
some air and my men are out of there.

1297
02:53:57,354 --> 02:54:01,483
Clark, maybe you're not hearing me.
There is no air. We are shut down.

1298
02:54:05,404 --> 02:54:07,907
I'm on a plane.
I'm gonna kill m

1299
02:54:10,409 --> 02:54:11,911
Ritt er?!

1300
02:54:14,413 --> 02:54:16,332
He's coming to you.

1301
02:54:16,415 --> 02:54:19,376
American Airlin at 19.50
with no security .

1302
02:54:20,419 --> 02:54:23,631
- Who is this?
- National Security Advisor Cutter.

1303
02:54:25,382 --> 02:54:28,093
Once Ryan's gone,
we're back on line.

1304
02:54:28,385 --> 02:54:30,137
You understand?

1305
02:54:31,388 --> 02:54:32,890
Yes, sir.

1306
02:55:55,472 --> 02:55:56,473
Clark...

1307
02:55:56,473 --> 02:55:58,475
- Jesus!
- Get in the van.

1308
02:55:58,475 --> 02:56:02,146
- Don't do this, I came to find you.
- You found me. Get in.

1309
02:56:07,526 --> 02:56:09,361
Behind the wheel.

1310
02:56:10,529 --> 02:56:11,989
Clark...

1311
02:56:13,532 --> 02:56:14,909
Drive.

1312
02:56:42,520 --> 02:56:44,688
- Ritter.
- Ryan's dead.

1313
02:56:46,524 --> 02:56:47,816
How?

1314
02:56:49,568 --> 02:56:52,446
I killed him.
Turn the satellite back on.

1315
02:56:55,574 --> 02:56:59,453
You told me to get rid of Ryan
and we're back in business, right?

1316
02:57:25,563 --> 02:57:28,065
What the hell are you doing here?

1317
02:57:30,609 --> 02:57:33,362
I came to help you
get those guys out.

1318
02:57:35,614 --> 02:57:37,867
What can you do to help me?

1319
02:57:43,622 --> 02:57:45,457
What do you need?

1320
02:57:46,625 --> 02:57:48,294
A helicopter.

1321
02:57:50,629 --> 02:57:52,256
A helicopter.

1322
02:58:05,603 --> 02:58:08,606
- ls this "Happy Hour"?
- It's always "Happy Hour".

1323
02:58:08,606 --> 02:58:11,734
- Your pilot owns this joint?
- He lives here.

1324
02:58:18,657 --> 02:58:20,242
Here he is.

1325
02:58:30,669 --> 02:58:33,506
Morning.
I'm here to rent the helicopter.

1326
02:58:35,633 --> 02:58:38,969
Sorry, we don't rent it anymore.
But it is for sale.

1327
02:58:41,639 --> 02:58:43,390
How much is it?

1328
02:58:44,642 --> 02:58:46,602
Two million dollars.

1329
02:58:53,692 --> 02:58:56,695
My pilot and I would
have to do a test flight.

1330
02:58:56,695 --> 02:58:59,698
Of course.
You just have to leave a deposit.

1331
02:59:00,699 --> 02:59:02,535
How much is that?

1332
02:59:02,701 --> 02:59:04,662
Two million dollars.

1333
02:59:10,709 --> 02:59:13,170
Would you take a company cheque?

1334
02:59:19,677 --> 02:59:20,970
Yes.

1335
02:59:29,687 --> 02:59:32,773
- Here we go.
- Big son of a bitch, ain't she?

1336
02:59:35,734 --> 02:59:39,071
- Do you have any time in this type?
- Nine o'clock.

1337
02:59:49,748 --> 02:59:53,085
- Get out of my chopper.
- No. My chopper. Let's go.

1338
03:00:16,775 --> 03:00:19,570
Their last communication
put them here.

1339
03:00:20,779 --> 03:00:24,116
The closest extraction point is here.
In this gorge.

1340
03:00:26,785 --> 03:00:28,287
I got it.

1341
03:00:48,766 --> 03:00:51,393
- ls that a body down there?
- Yes.

1342
03:00:53,771 --> 03:00:56,148
- One of ours?
- One of mine.

1343
03:01:00,820 --> 03:01:04,323
Find a place to set her down.
We'll look for the others.

1344
03:01:48,868 --> 03:01:51,537
Nowhere to run to.
No place to hide.

1345
03:01:53,873 --> 03:01:57,209
Blood trails everywhere.
They all lead to the river.

1346
03:02:11,849 --> 03:02:14,685
These are the falls
we saw from the air.

1347
03:02:31,911 --> 03:02:35,080
You left us!
You left us with no support at all!

1348
03:02:37,917 --> 03:02:40,878
You left us out to dry!
You son of a bitch!

1349
03:02:44,882 --> 03:02:47,801
- It's not his fault.
- Whose fauIt is it?

1350
03:02:49,887 --> 03:02:51,597
It's my fault.

1351
03:02:56,894 --> 03:02:58,604
It's my fault.

1352
03:03:10,950 --> 03:03:13,828
I was on point
when the last attack came.

1353
03:03:15,955 --> 03:03:17,790
Over a mile away.

1354
03:03:19,959 --> 03:03:22,545
By the time I got back it was over.

1355
03:03:22,962 --> 03:03:25,422
They were taking the Captain Oso.

1356
03:03:27,925 --> 03:03:29,510
The others?

1357
03:03:29,927 --> 03:03:31,637
I buried them.

1358
03:03:42,940 --> 03:03:46,193
They loaded the prisoners here.
Blood everywhere.

1359
03:03:46,986 --> 03:03:50,197
- God knows where they are now.
- Escobedo knows.

1360
03:03:50,990 --> 03:03:53,993
What are you going to do?
Knock on his door?

1361
03:03:59,999 --> 03:04:03,878
Morning. I'd like to see Ernesto
Escobedo. I have no appointment.

1362
03:04:06,005 --> 03:04:07,506
Thank you.

1363
03:04:17,975 --> 03:04:19,226
OK.

1364
03:04:21,979 --> 03:04:23,480
Hands up.

1365
03:04:24,982 --> 03:04:26,484
Hands up!

1366
03:04:28,027 --> 03:04:29,445
Wallet.

1367
03:04:35,034 --> 03:04:37,036
It's a tape recorder.

1368
03:04:42,041 --> 03:04:43,501
He's in.

1369
03:04:47,046 --> 03:04:49,340
Bird, this is Variable, over.

1370
03:04:52,009 --> 03:04:54,345
Bird, this is Variable, over.

1371
03:05:12,071 --> 03:05:13,989
Dr Ryan... Come in.

1372
03:05:29,088 --> 03:05:31,549
Sit down.
What can I do for you?

1373
03:05:34,051 --> 03:05:37,388
I didn't know who else to turn to.
I have a problem.

1374
03:05:41,058 --> 03:05:44,603
An associate of mine, a coffee buyer
and his assistant, -

1375
03:05:45,062 --> 03:05:47,857
- were on a business trip
in this area.

1376
03:05:48,065 --> 03:05:51,235
They disappeared yesterday.
I'm very concerned.

1377
03:05:52,111 --> 03:05:53,779
Coffee buyer?

1378
03:05:55,114 --> 03:05:57,116
It's very important to me
to find them.

1379
03:05:57,116 --> 03:06:00,244
Coffee buying is becoming
a dangerous business.

1380
03:06:02,121 --> 03:06:04,707
Yes. Well, it was for Peter Hardin.

1381
03:06:10,129 --> 03:06:12,965
- Who?
- He was a client of Lindo Coffee.

1382
03:06:13,090 --> 03:06:17,052
- Lindo Coffee has many clients.
- You must have heard of this one.

1383
03:06:19,096 --> 03:06:22,057
He owed your company
a great deal of money.

1384
03:06:22,099 --> 03:06:25,060
I'lI have to talk to accounting
about that.

1385
03:06:28,105 --> 03:06:30,065
650 million dollars.

1386
03:06:33,152 --> 03:06:34,737
And change.

1387
03:06:37,156 --> 03:06:41,076
Are you offering to help me with
the collection of an unpaid debt?

1388
03:06:42,161 --> 03:06:44,580
- No.
- What are you offering?

1389
03:06:47,166 --> 03:06:49,960
A trade.
Felix Cortez has sold you out.

1390
03:06:52,171 --> 03:06:55,841
He will murder you and your family,
and take over the cartel.

1391
03:06:56,133 --> 03:06:58,302
Where's my tape recorder?

1392
03:07:05,142 --> 03:07:06,852
Play the tape.

1393
03:07:40,177 --> 03:07:41,762
Let's move.

1394
03:08:12,251 --> 03:08:15,254
I'd like you to meet
my new friend, Dr Ryan.

1395
03:08:15,254 --> 03:08:17,756
"Doctor"? Why? ls somebody sick?

1396
03:08:32,229 --> 03:08:34,106
What does he want?

1397
03:08:36,233 --> 03:08:38,819
The safe return of his associates.

1398
03:08:39,278 --> 03:08:41,906
And what does he offer us in return?

1399
03:08:44,283 --> 03:08:45,576
You.

1400
03:08:52,291 --> 03:08:56,045
Whatever this man has told you
is a lie. He lies for a living.

1401
03:08:56,295 --> 03:09:00,382
He's in the intelligence business.
You're in the intelligence business!

1402
03:09:08,265 --> 03:09:11,018
You've taken care of
the litt le fish.

1403
03:09:11,268 --> 03:09:13,270
I'll take care of
the one that got away.

1404
03:09:13,270 --> 03:09:16,774
Once Escobedo is gone,
I'll be in a positi. to help you.

1405
03:09:18,275 --> 03:09:20,361
So, the question is...

1406
03:09:24,323 --> 03:09:26,992
...what am I supposed to do with you?

1407
03:09:30,329 --> 03:09:33,457
I guess I'm supposed to
kill you with this bat!

1408
03:09:41,298 --> 03:09:42,716
Get up.

1409
03:09:48,305 --> 03:09:51,892
Dramatic seizures. Drastic
reductions, no more violence...

1410
03:09:53,310 --> 03:09:55,479
You'lI have your victory.

1411
03:09:56,313 --> 03:09:58,232
In return for what?

1412
03:10:39,356 --> 03:10:41,859
- Where are they?
-They're here.

1413
03:10:43,402 --> 03:10:46,155
The American killed Ernesto!
Let's go!

1414
03:11:35,454 --> 03:11:37,540
Bird to Variable. Over.

1415
03:11:51,428 --> 03:11:54,598
Bird, this is Variable.
Where the hell are you?!

1416
03:11:56,433 --> 03:11:59,770
I'm cruising about five klicks
south of the village.

1417
03:12:00,437 --> 03:12:03,649
- Stay there. I'll get back to you.
- Roger that,

1418
03:12:16,495 --> 03:12:18,747
- No one.
- The prisoners!

1419
03:13:05,544 --> 03:13:07,922
Come on, guys.
Let's go, son.

1420
03:13:10,508 --> 03:13:12,593
We're going home, boys.

1421
03:14:25,624 --> 03:14:28,419
Pick us up
at the Lindo Coffee factory.

1422
03:16:04,682 --> 03:16:08,352
Not only can I expose you
to the press, so can the soldiers.

1423
03:16:09,687 --> 03:16:13,649
Do you want to take your chances
with the courts and the reporters?

1424
03:16:15,693 --> 03:16:19,196
To end the polit ical career
ofyour commander-in-chief?

1425
03:17:04,783 --> 03:17:06,285
Let's go!

1426
03:17:33,771 --> 03:17:36,857
Get your asses in here!
Come on, we got to go!

1427
03:17:40,820 --> 03:17:42,279
Come on!

1428
03:17:49,829 --> 03:17:51,831
Hold it! We wait for Ryan!

1429
03:17:51,831 --> 03:17:53,958
Yeah? We're out of here!

1430
03:18:01,799 --> 03:18:04,134
Set it down! He's down there!

1431
03:18:16,814 --> 03:18:18,274
Come on!

1432
03:18:37,877 --> 03:18:39,545
I've got you!

1433
03:18:45,843 --> 03:18:47,678
Chavez, cover me!

1434
03:18:57,855 --> 03:19:00,191
Your hand. Give me your hand!

1435
03:20:05,923 --> 03:20:08,342
The President wilI see you now.

1436
03:20:21,939 --> 03:20:24,191
Jack! I'm glad you're here.

1437
03:20:25,943 --> 03:20:28,529
Sit down.
Can I get you anything?

1438
03:20:29,989 --> 03:20:31,240
No.

1439
03:20:32,992 --> 03:20:36,328
- Come on, sit down.
- I would prefer to stand, sir.

1440
03:20:38,998 --> 03:20:42,751
Some things have gone on here
that I'm just becoming aware of.

1441
03:20:46,005 --> 03:20:49,550
I was kept in the dark, as you were,
for a very long time.

1442
03:20:49,967 --> 03:20:52,261
- Troubling things.
- Yeah.

1443
03:20:53,971 --> 03:20:57,975
Now we have to sort them out, figure
out who's responsible for what.

1444
03:20:57,975 --> 03:21:01,604
And what to do about it.
And we have to do it delicately, -

1445
03:21:01,979 --> 03:21:04,982
- otherwise people might
get the wrong idea.

1446
03:21:05,983 --> 03:21:07,735
We have to lie.

1447
03:21:09,028 --> 03:21:11,655
- Did I say that?
- No, you didn't.

1448
03:21:14,033 --> 03:21:16,368
- You're upset.
- I'm upset.

1449
03:21:18,037 --> 03:21:21,832
It's understandable. Do you mind
if I give you a bit of advice?

1450
03:21:24,043 --> 03:21:26,045
You know this, you're smart.

1451
03:21:26,045 --> 03:21:29,256
Never make important decisions
while you're upset.

1452
03:21:30,007 --> 03:21:33,844
You did. American soldiers and
civilians are dead because of it.

1453
03:21:36,013 --> 03:21:39,683
- I never ordered any...
- Don't you play that game with me!

1454
03:21:40,017 --> 03:21:43,896
Don't you dishonour their memories
by pretending you didn't know!

1455
03:21:44,021 --> 03:21:47,149
- How dare you lecture...
- How dare you, sir?!

1456
03:21:49,026 --> 03:21:52,655
How dare you come here
and bark at me like a junkyard dog!

1457
03:21:53,072 --> 03:21:55,908
I am the President
of the United States!

1458
03:21:59,078 --> 03:22:01,831
lt gives me no pleasure
to do it, sir.

1459
03:22:03,082 --> 03:22:06,627
As acting Deputy Director
of lntelligence it is my duty -

1460
03:22:07,086 --> 03:22:10,673
- to report this matter
to the Senate Oversight Committee.

1461
03:22:16,053 --> 03:22:18,931
- You're not going to do that.
- I'm not?

1462
03:22:24,061 --> 03:22:27,189
You've got yourself
a chip in the big game now.

1463
03:22:29,066 --> 03:22:33,195
You're going to save that for a time
when your own ass is on the line.

1464
03:22:34,113 --> 03:22:36,782
And then you're going to pull it out.

1465
03:22:38,117 --> 03:22:41,078
And I'm going to cash it in for you.
Right?

1466
03:22:45,124 --> 03:22:48,544
I don't think I have anything more
to say to you, sir.

1467
03:22:49,128 --> 03:22:53,090
The country can't afford another
scandal, Jack. To protect itseIf -

1468
03:22:55,092 --> 03:22:59,096
- it won't allow another deception
that goes all the way to the top.

1469
03:23:01,098 --> 03:23:04,852
You'll take the blame. Cutter
and Ritter will take some too, -

1470
03:23:05,102 --> 03:23:08,105
- but it will only amount to
a slap on the wrist.

1471
03:23:08,105 --> 03:23:11,400
Then 20,000 dollars an hour
on the lecture circuit.

1472
03:23:14,153 --> 03:23:17,031
The rest of the blame
will fall on Greer.

1473
03:23:18,157 --> 03:23:20,951
Oh yeah, you'll take him
down with you.

1474
03:23:22,161 --> 03:23:24,163
You'll destroy his reputation.

1475
03:23:24,163 --> 03:23:28,000
But that's as far as it will go.
The old Potomac two-step, Jack.

1476
03:23:33,172 --> 03:23:35,925
I'm sorry, Mr President,
I don't dance.

1477
03:24:00,199 --> 03:24:02,201
Ryan, have you got a minute?

1478
03:24:02,201 --> 03:24:03,452
No.

1479
03:24:05,204 --> 03:24:06,997
We need to talk!

1480
03:24:08,207 --> 03:24:09,542
Ryan!

1481
03:24:34,191 --> 03:24:38,028
The Committ ee will me to order.
The chair will w call Dr Ryan.

1482
03:25:01,218 --> 03:25:04,889
Dr Ryan, thank you for appearing
before the Committee today.

1483
03:25:07,224 --> 03:25:10,019
Please stand
and raise your right hand.

1484
03:25:14,231 --> 03:25:18,027
Do you solemnly swear that
the testimony you're about to give -

1485
03:25:19,278 --> 03:25:23,115
- is the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

1486
03:25:26,285 --> 03:25:27,620
I do.

1487
03:25:29,288 --> 03:25:33,125
Dr Ryan, you may consider yourself
under oath. Please be seated.

1488
03:30:38,556 --> 03:30:40,808
