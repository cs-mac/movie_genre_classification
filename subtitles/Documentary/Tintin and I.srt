1
00:00:50,647 --> 00:00:55,880
You are getting secrets from me that
I have never told anyone before.

2
00:00:56,087 --> 00:00:59,284
I don't like talking about myself.

3
00:00:59,487 --> 00:01:02,604
I instantly build a wall around myself.

4
00:01:02,807 --> 00:01:08,006
But with you it's different.
I don't know why.

5
00:01:08,207 --> 00:01:10,880
But that's how it is.

6
00:01:17,967 --> 00:01:21,926
The story carries a message.

7
00:01:22,127 --> 00:01:26,643
It definitely carries a message,
don't you agree?

8
00:01:26,847 --> 00:01:31,967
I can see now that the story
was a way of expressing myself.

9
00:01:32,167 --> 00:01:35,239
That's clear enough.

10
00:01:35,447 --> 00:01:41,079
- I am quite confused.
- Of course you are. Of course.

11
00:01:43,927 --> 00:01:47,715
Yes, I was very confused.
For several reasons.

12
00:01:47,927 --> 00:01:52,921
There I was, a 23-year-old student
in the office of Georges Remi.

13
00:01:53,127 --> 00:01:56,961
The great cartoonist 
better known as Hergé.

14
00:01:57,167 --> 00:02:03,276
I literally walked in off the street
and we hardly knew each other.

15
00:02:03,487 --> 00:02:07,446
And there we sat for four long days -

16
00:02:07,647 --> 00:02:13,882
- speaking of things that changed
my understanding of what he did.

17
00:02:16,127 --> 00:02:20,803
We talked about the incredible
adventures of Tintin.

18
00:02:22,327 --> 00:02:25,160
23 books,
created over a period of 47 years -

19
00:02:25,367 --> 00:02:30,919
- translated into 58 languages
and published in millions of copies.

20
00:02:31,127 --> 00:02:33,083
And why?

21
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:35,642
Like many others, I've always felt -

22
00:02:35,847 --> 00:02:41,922
- that the books were much more than
the intent to entertain children.

23
00:02:46,047 --> 00:02:49,005
And I found that I was right.

24
00:02:56,807 --> 00:03:03,485
In Tintin, Hergé distilled 50 years
of politics, wars and daily life.

25
00:03:05,607 --> 00:03:08,246
Cars, trains and planes ...

26
00:03:08,447 --> 00:03:12,725
Businessmen, dictators, scientists.

27
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:19,321
You can trace the history of the 20th
century through Tintin's adventures.

28
00:03:25,847 --> 00:03:29,044
You'll find strange things too.

29
00:03:29,247 --> 00:03:34,275
Paranormal experiences,
dreams, frightening things.

30
00:03:34,487 --> 00:03:38,446
Things that have to do
with the inner life.

31
00:03:38,647 --> 00:03:43,163
What I discovered in talking with
him was that this innocent series -

32
00:03:43,367 --> 00:03:46,837
-increasingly became
a personal expression -

33
00:03:47,047 --> 00:03:50,005
- a way to express his own problems -

34
00:03:50,207 --> 00:03:55,327
- and often his inner crises.

35
00:03:57,767 --> 00:04:02,124
The story carries a message.

36
00:04:02,327 --> 00:04:06,798
It definitely carries a message,
don't you agree?

37
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:12,319
TINTIN AND I

38
00:04:15,807 --> 00:04:20,597
My name is Numa Sadoul. I am
an actor, director, and writer.

39
00:04:20,807 --> 00:04:24,243
But in October, 1971,
I was a student -

40
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:29,396
- and went to Brussels,
the rainy Mecca of the comic book -

41
00:04:29,607 --> 00:04:35,079
- to interview cartoonists
for a small magazine.

42
00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:43,244
But the undisputed high point 
of the trip was meeting Hergé.

43
00:04:45,127 --> 00:04:49,166
Hergé, October, 1971.

44
00:04:49,367 --> 00:04:53,155
- Should I move closer?
- No, no.

45
00:04:53,367 --> 00:04:57,201
It's a sensitive microphone.

46
00:04:58,567 --> 00:05:02,196
He was extremely enigmatic.

47
00:05:02,407 --> 00:05:04,967
When I saw him on television
or in the papers -

48
00:05:05,167 --> 00:05:08,125
- he always seemed
very elegant and charming -

49
00:05:08,327 --> 00:05:11,444
- but also reserved -

50
00:05:11,647 --> 00:05:16,801
- as though he made a point
of concealing his own personality.

51
00:05:17,007 --> 00:05:23,355
- How do we get started?
- It's up to you. Does it work?

52
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:27,526
I was very curious.
And then I felt a sudden impulse.

53
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:32,721
I must tell you that
I may ask tricky questions.

54
00:05:32,927 --> 00:05:37,762
I asked him if he was willing
to do a long in-depth interview -

55
00:05:37,967 --> 00:05:40,003
- which could become a book.

56
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:42,880
To my great surprise, he said yes.

57
00:05:43,087 --> 00:05:46,204
Just like that. I don't know why.

58
00:05:46,407 --> 00:05:52,357
So we immediately began
a week of conversations.

59
00:05:54,447 --> 00:05:58,759
I can see now that Tintin was
sort of a projection of myself -

60
00:05:58,967 --> 00:06:04,963
- just like all the other characters,
because they are all part of me.

61
00:06:05,167 --> 00:06:10,958
Tintin is a projection of me.
The hero without fear or flaws.

62
00:06:11,167 --> 00:06:11,405
It is how I would like to be.
In any case, what I strove to be.

63
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:15,405
It is how I would like to be.
In any case, what I strove to be.

64
00:06:15,607 --> 00:06:21,398
Over the years, he was
surrounded by flawed characters -

65
00:06:21,607 --> 00:06:25,043
- people with flaws,
physical and moral flaws.

66
00:06:25,247 --> 00:06:31,516
Captain Haddock has many flaws,
but accepts himself as he is.

67
00:06:33,647 --> 00:06:37,959
There are the Thompson Twins.
They're idiots -

68
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:42,524
- which I often am.
I see myself in them.

69
00:06:42,727 --> 00:06:50,361
But in Tintin, there's a
subconscious desire to be a hero -

70
00:06:50,567 --> 00:06:53,798
- which you rarely are in real life.

71
00:06:54,007 --> 00:06:57,716
Probably never.

72
00:06:59,407 --> 00:07:02,922
- You're always someone's hero.
- Of course.

73
00:07:03,127 --> 00:07:06,756
But to yourself, it's hard.

74
00:07:06,967 --> 00:07:12,758
It's hard to accept yourself.
That was my great problem.

75
00:07:12,967 --> 00:07:16,323
- Was it hard for you?
- Definitely.

76
00:07:16,527 --> 00:07:19,803
To accept myself ...

77
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:25,000
A Catholic childhood,
going to a Catholic high school -

78
00:07:25,207 --> 00:07:28,756
- certain moral concepts,
Catholicism ...

79
00:07:28,967 --> 00:07:33,085
It's all very hard to overcome.

80
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:36,006
Just look at the concept of sin -

81
00:07:36,207 --> 00:07:40,325
- which haunted me until
not so very long ago.

82
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:45,317
It's maybe 15-20 years ago.

83
00:07:45,527 --> 00:07:50,885
- But Tintin is a real boy scout?
- Yes, I was a boy scout myself.

84
00:07:51,087 --> 00:07:57,720
As such I set pledges
and loyalty very high -

85
00:07:57,927 --> 00:08:02,318
- and I still do today.

86
00:08:04,207 --> 00:08:08,280
It's a bit funny, but I don't think
it's a bad starting point.

87
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:14,039
But I have suffered from it.
When I've broken appointments -

88
00:08:14,247 --> 00:08:20,482
- or not kept my word,
then I've suffered.

89
00:08:24,527 --> 00:08:31,000
For example ... No, I won't talk
about that here. Well, I could.

90
00:08:31,207 --> 00:08:34,404
I went through a crisis -

91
00:08:34,607 --> 00:08:39,476
- and went to a psychiatrist
to get through it.

92
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:44,761
That's when I did ''Tintin in Tibet'',
where everything is white.

93
00:08:44,967 --> 00:08:51,645
I yearned for purity.
I only dreamt in white.

94
00:08:53,327 --> 00:08:56,603
''Tintin in Tibet'' is about mountains.

95
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:04,646
And eternal snow.

96
00:09:08,767 --> 00:09:13,602
I was totally taken by surprise
that he confided in me that way.

97
00:09:13,807 --> 00:09:15,843
I was interviewing someone -

98
00:09:16,047 --> 00:09:21,485
- and suddenly we were into
psychoanalysis.

99
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:24,724
Suddenly I was psychoanalyzing -

100
00:09:24,927 --> 00:09:31,116
- the man I was supposed to
interview. It was deeply disturbing.

101
00:09:31,327 --> 00:09:35,878
He was giving me a role
I could not handle -

102
00:09:36,087 --> 00:09:39,602
- because I was too young,
but I threw myself into it -

103
00:09:39,807 --> 00:09:44,483
- with the naivety
and blindness young people have -

104
00:09:44,687 --> 00:09:47,838
- and took on the role of psychiatrist.

105
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:50,686
How was your childhood?

106
00:09:50,887 --> 00:09:53,685
My childhood?

107
00:09:53,887 --> 00:09:57,562
Now you're cruel. Very cruel.

108
00:09:59,487 --> 00:10:02,001
Completely mediocre.

109
00:10:02,207 --> 00:10:05,517
In a middle class environment.

110
00:10:05,727 --> 00:10:10,437
My childhood was no paradise.

111
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:15,805
I still despise looking back at it.

112
00:10:16,007 --> 00:10:19,886
When I look back
at my childhood and youth ...

113
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,843
I'm not happy with it.

114
00:10:25,047 --> 00:10:27,959
Because it was mediocre?

115
00:10:28,167 --> 00:10:33,639
Because I felt mediocre.

116
00:10:35,407 --> 00:10:41,846
When I look back at my youth,
it was grey. Grey and mediocre.

117
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:47,644
I definitely don't want to return to it.

118
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:51,806
It wasn't until I made it to
''Le Vingtième Siècle'' -

119
00:10:52,007 --> 00:10:58,116
- and Wallez, the abbot, who
influenced me a lot, I can see now ...

120
00:10:58,327 --> 00:11:01,763
He made me aware of myself.

121
00:11:01,967 --> 00:11:05,323
Now the Rev. Wallez
enters the picture.

122
00:11:05,527 --> 00:11:08,360
I knew absolutely nothing
about Rev. Wallez.

123
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,603
I had no idea who he was.

124
00:11:10,807 --> 00:11:14,561
The first time I heard about him
was when Hergé mentioned him.

125
00:11:14,767 --> 00:11:20,239
I had no idea of the influence
this man had on his thoughts -

126
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:25,919
- his life, his marriage
and his philosophy.

127
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,357
Wallez was extremely
politically aware.

128
00:11:30,567 --> 00:11:33,923
As the editor of "Le Vingtième 
Siècle", an ultra-Catholic newspaper -

129
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:37,244
- he admired Hitler
and Italian Fascism.

130
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:41,679
He was proud of the picture
of Mussolini in his office.

131
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:46,000
This was everywhere in the 1930's.

132
00:11:46,207 --> 00:11:50,917
There was a bizarre alliance between
the church and Fascism in Belgium.

133
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:54,597
Rev. Wallez saw it
as a modern point of view.

134
00:11:54,807 --> 00:11:57,924
He also had modern thoughts
for his paper.

135
00:11:58,127 --> 00:12:00,436
He wanted
to make a youth section -

136
00:12:00,647 --> 00:12:05,675
- that could amuse the kids
and teach them his political ideas.

137
00:12:05,887 --> 00:12:07,798
Then he discovered Hergé -

138
00:12:08,007 --> 00:12:12,080
- who had a junior position
in the advertising department.

139
00:12:12,287 --> 00:12:16,883
He asked him to create
a young hero, a Catholic reporter -

140
00:12:17,087 --> 00:12:20,796
- who would fight for good
all over the world.

141
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:25,125
That's how Tintin was born in 1929.

142
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:32,165
- He went to the Soviet Union first?
- Yes, that was a political game.

143
00:12:32,367 --> 00:12:36,838
''Le Vingtième Siècle'' was
a very right-wing newspaper.

144
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:41,086
But I had the Pope's blessing
and that of my editor -

145
00:12:41,287 --> 00:12:44,757
- so I felt I was safe.

146
00:12:44,967 --> 00:12:45,167
Tintin's world was, in a way,
blessed beforehand.

147
00:12:45,167 --> 00:13:09,047
Tintin's world was, in a way,
blessed beforehand.

148
00:13:09,047 --> 00:13:10,560
Then I realized -

149
00:13:10,767 --> 00:13:14,362
- that Wallez organized
his private life quite literally.

150
00:13:14,567 --> 00:13:18,003
He even assigned
his secretary as his wife.

151
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:24,601
Her name was Germaine Kieckens
and was also his faithful disciple.

152
00:13:24,807 --> 00:13:30,439
Both my wife and I
were influenced by him.

153
00:13:30,647 --> 00:13:34,003
We both tried
to exceed each other -

154
00:13:34,207 --> 00:13:38,519
- to achieve perfection.

155
00:13:38,727 --> 00:13:42,959
The best attitude,
the highest morals, etc.

156
00:14:12,447 --> 00:14:16,565
Naturally, I took this
as a bit of a joke.

157
00:14:16,767 --> 00:14:20,123
- But there it was ...
- A joke in which way?

158
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:23,956
The series was a game.

159
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:28,683
Tintin was a game for me until ...

160
00:14:28,887 --> 00:14:32,118
Until ''The Blue Lotus'' ...

161
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:38,757
''The Blue Lotus'' became
a turning point, because -

162
00:14:38,967 --> 00:14:42,562
- when I announced
in ''Le Petit Vingtième'' -

163
00:14:42,767 --> 00:14:46,646
- that Tintin was going
to the Far East and China -

164
00:14:46,847 --> 00:14:52,160
- I got a letter from
another abbot who wrote:

165
00:14:52,367 --> 00:14:57,441
''If you make the mistake of drawing
a Chinese with a pigtail'' -

166
00:14:57,647 --> 00:15:02,926
- ''or have him eat birds' nests
while shrieking ''Hee, hee!'' -

167
00:15:03,127 --> 00:15:06,597
- ''you will cause much damage.''

168
00:15:06,807 --> 00:15:09,560
So he put me in touch
with a young Chinese -

169
00:15:09,767 --> 00:15:13,601
- who was a painter,
sculptor and poet.

170
00:15:13,807 --> 00:15:16,765
His name was Tchang Tchong-Jen.

171
00:15:16,967 --> 00:15:21,995
And to my great surprise,
I discovered a whole new world.

172
00:15:25,367 --> 00:15:29,565
He taught me many new things.
Chinese poetry and calligraphy.

173
00:15:29,767 --> 00:15:36,764
The wind, inspiration.
The bone, graphical strictness.

174
00:15:37,967 --> 00:15:42,119
It was a revelation for me.

175
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:44,485
''Dear Tchang'' -

176
00:16:44,687 --> 00:16:48,475
- ''I remember the day so well
when you visited my wife and me.''

177
00:16:48,687 --> 00:16:53,078
''I can still see and hear you explain
that all things have a soul.''

178
00:16:53,287 --> 00:16:57,997
''You spoke of the life
in the tree behind our house.''

179
00:16:58,207 --> 00:17:02,803
I lost contact with him.
I wrote to him after the war.

180
00:17:03,007 --> 00:17:07,762
During the war, it was impossible,
but I never heard from him.

181
00:17:07,967 --> 00:17:13,200
I try every now and then,
but I never hear from him. Never.

182
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:22,284
Yes?

183
00:17:23,687 --> 00:17:26,406
That was nice of you.

184
00:17:31,367 --> 00:17:34,518
You know, right here ...

185
00:17:34,727 --> 00:17:38,561
- Did you want milk?
- No, it's fine like this.

186
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:42,123
That was nice of you, thank you.

187
00:17:46,847 --> 00:17:53,161
''The Crab with the Golden Claws'' is
key. It's where the Captain appears.

188
00:17:53,367 --> 00:17:55,801
He's speaking about Captain Haddock.

189
00:17:56,007 --> 00:17:57,884
Tramps! Terrorists! Troglodytes!

190
00:17:58,207 --> 00:18:00,084
Tramps! Terrorists! Troglodytes!

191
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:05,839
- And Haddock's curses?
- The sounds inspire me.

192
00:18:06,047 --> 00:18:08,925
Sometimes I look in a dictionary -

193
00:18:09,127 --> 00:18:12,802
- and come across an expression
that suits Haddock -

194
00:18:13,007 --> 00:18:14,759
- and I write it down.

195
00:18:14,967 --> 00:18:17,162
Sea lice! Savages!

196
00:18:17,367 --> 00:18:21,519
Sycophants!
If you say it with emphasis ...

197
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:26,801
- That's a new one.
- I'm considering it right now.

198
00:18:27,007 --> 00:18:30,477
Visigoths! Vandals!

199
00:18:30,687 --> 00:18:34,726
His outbursts are always
caused by alcohol.

200
00:18:34,927 --> 00:18:40,479
In ''The Crab with the Golden Claws'',
it's only when he's drunk -

201
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:47,445
- that he rages and charges
the poor Arabs, who flee from him.

202
00:18:47,647 --> 00:18:51,322
Here's a picture I like.

203
00:18:51,527 --> 00:18:56,157
I love that one.

204
00:18:57,607 --> 00:19:01,361
It's the same person lying down -

205
00:19:01,567 --> 00:19:04,559
- who gets up and ...

206
00:19:04,767 --> 00:19:09,045
- It's an entire sequence in one.
- Exactly. In one drawing.

207
00:19:09,247 --> 00:19:13,957
- Have you done many of them?
- No, there are two that I like.

208
00:19:14,167 --> 00:19:19,525
The other is in
''Red Rackham's Treasure''.

209
00:19:21,847 --> 00:19:27,399
I like the two drawings.
Here it is. It says everything.

210
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:32,839
You come from the ship.
He has already debarked ...

211
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:37,040
It has it all.

212
00:19:37,247 --> 00:19:41,718
There are only two drawings
he really likes, only two.

213
00:19:41,927 --> 00:19:43,679
Both in the same style.

214
00:19:43,887 --> 00:19:46,845
It's almost constructed
in a triangle -

215
00:19:47,047 --> 00:19:50,164
- so that it ...

216
00:19:50,367 --> 00:19:55,487
It's a conscious construction.
It's not instinctive.

217
00:19:57,287 --> 00:20:00,836
When I see Franquin's drawings,
I always think:

218
00:20:01,047 --> 00:20:04,403
"How can anyone compare
Franquin and Hergé?"

219
00:20:04,607 --> 00:20:08,600
He is a much better cartoonist.
He is much more skillful.

220
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:13,358
He is a much greater artist.
It's not false modesty.

221
00:20:13,567 --> 00:20:16,684
I honestly mean it.

222
00:20:16,887 --> 00:20:23,804
But I tell a story with my own
drawings, which makes it complete.

223
00:20:29,767 --> 00:20:32,918
He falls into a hole -

224
00:20:33,127 --> 00:20:37,564
- and falls into the water.

225
00:20:37,767 --> 00:20:40,600
You have to go through
the waterfall -

226
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:46,757
- and then there's another world,
a parallel world, an adventure world.

227
00:20:46,967 --> 00:20:51,961
But no more adventurous than that.
It's completely logical.

228
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:56,877
It's not as though we say
three magic words and presto!

229
00:20:57,087 --> 00:21:00,921
The story makes sense,
but it shifts gear.

230
00:21:02,407 --> 00:21:09,199
- Hello!
- Tintin, is that you? Where are you?

231
00:21:09,407 --> 00:21:17,246
- Behind the waterfall.
- Behind the waterfall? How?

232
00:21:17,447 --> 00:21:20,883
Get down here, I'll show you.

233
00:21:21,087 --> 00:21:24,921
Pass through the waterfall.
It's only a thin veil of water.

234
00:21:25,127 --> 00:21:28,642
My goodness!
Well, if it's necessary.

235
00:21:31,967 --> 00:21:34,879
Thundering typhoons!

236
00:21:35,087 --> 00:21:38,682
This is incredible.

237
00:22:42,887 --> 00:22:46,163
It is difficult to draw.

238
00:22:46,367 --> 00:22:50,645
It's not just a sketch
you do on the fly.

239
00:22:50,847 --> 00:22:54,806
It's a major arrangement where
the pieces fall into place -

240
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:58,397
- with documents, research, etc.

241
00:23:02,127 --> 00:23:05,597
My drawings have to be nurtured.

242
00:24:50,047 --> 00:24:56,964
In ''King Ottokar's Scepter'', the bad
guy is ''Müsstler'', Mussolini-Hitler.

243
00:24:57,167 --> 00:25:02,082
One day at the ''Vingtième Siècle'',
a German came by.

244
00:25:02,287 --> 00:25:08,203
He worked for
the German secret police.

245
00:25:09,727 --> 00:25:14,243
I did not know it because
he had a Belgian name.

246
00:25:14,447 --> 00:25:17,280
But he told me:

247
00:25:17,487 --> 00:25:21,526
''The plane in ''King Ottokar's
scepter'' is a Messerschmitt.''

248
00:25:21,727 --> 00:25:23,922
Of course it was.

249
00:25:24,127 --> 00:25:27,517
''Don't do that sort of thing
too often''.

250
00:25:27,727 --> 00:25:33,438
He didn't say anything else,
but it made me wary.

251
00:27:14,927 --> 00:27:17,999
In Brussels,
the war is hardly being felt.

252
00:27:18,207 --> 00:27:22,644
Against British wishes, the
Belgians gave up without a fight -

253
00:27:22,847 --> 00:27:25,680
- so the city was not damaged.

254
00:27:25,887 --> 00:27:29,084
These pictures show that
the Belgians did the right thing -

255
00:27:29,287 --> 00:27:34,202
- and their trust
in the German troops is rewarded.

256
00:27:34,407 --> 00:27:38,400
The war was over for us.
We had no allies.

257
00:27:38,607 --> 00:27:45,046
The Germans were here. It wasn't
nice, but it wouldn't last forever.

258
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:51,083
So it wasn't a problem for me
to work for a paper like ''Le Soir''.

259
00:27:51,287 --> 00:27:54,518
For me, the case was clear.

260
00:27:54,727 --> 00:27:57,764
I understood that
the subject was taboo.

261
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:01,676
That was the big question 
about Hergé:

262
00:28:01,887 --> 00:28:06,085
His views during the war.

263
00:28:07,447 --> 00:28:10,996
During the war, Hergé stayed
in contact with Rev. Wallez -

264
00:28:11,207 --> 00:28:15,086
- and he encouraged him
to work for ''Le Soir''.

265
00:28:15,287 --> 00:28:20,441
You had to support the Germans in
their fight against Soviet Communism.

266
00:28:20,647 --> 00:28:24,242
But Hergé was warned
by several people.

267
00:28:26,967 --> 00:28:30,357
Brussels, October 16, 1940.

268
00:28:30,567 --> 00:28:34,037
''As a father of a large family,
let me express my sorrow'' -

269
00:28:34,247 --> 00:28:38,479
- ''at seeing Tintin and Snowy
printed in the new 'Le Soir'.''

270
00:28:38,687 --> 00:28:40,518
''From the margins
of your amusing drawings'' -

271
00:28:40,727 --> 00:28:45,642
- ''the children are being influenced
by the new German heathenism.''

272
00:28:45,847 --> 00:28:50,079
''I ask you to reconsider.
If it is possible, back out.''

273
00:28:50,287 --> 00:28:54,326
''I apologize for not signing this,
but times are uncertain.''

274
00:28:54,527 --> 00:28:58,679
It's the Devil's messenger!
One of Satan's henchmen!

275
00:28:58,887 --> 00:29:05,406
- One of Beelzebub's servants!
- That guy is pretty annoying.

276
00:29:05,607 --> 00:29:07,916
For me the matter was simple.

277
00:29:08,127 --> 00:29:15,636
I worked like a miner,
a tram driver or a baker.

278
00:29:15,847 --> 00:29:20,523
But it wasn't seen that way.
If it had to do with papers -

279
00:29:20,727 --> 00:29:23,321
- it was seen as treason -

280
00:29:23,527 --> 00:29:27,645
- while it was something different
for train drivers.

281
00:29:27,847 --> 00:29:33,046
Go back to Satan!
To your master!

282
00:32:16,007 --> 00:32:19,283
''The Shooting Star''.

283
00:32:19,487 --> 00:32:23,765
- A bit fantastic.
- Yes.

284
00:32:23,967 --> 00:32:29,678
- This episode is very strange.
- Yes, very mystical, for me too.

285
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:33,881
For me too.

286
00:32:51,807 --> 00:32:55,800
Look here. What do you say?

287
00:32:56,007 --> 00:33:00,000
It looks like a huge ball of fire.

288
00:33:00,207 --> 00:33:04,405
Yes, a huge ball of fire.
An enormous ball of fire.

289
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:08,077
It's headed straight towards us
at an incredible speed.

290
00:33:08,287 --> 00:33:13,315
Is it coming towards us?
It is not going to hit us, is it?

291
00:33:13,527 --> 00:33:18,203
The ball will collide with the earth.

292
00:33:18,407 --> 00:33:25,518
- Good heavens, that means ...
- Yes, the end of the world.

293
00:34:00,207 --> 00:34:03,677
He must have
been totally disoriented.

294
00:34:03,887 --> 00:34:06,162
Everything crumbled.

295
00:34:06,367 --> 00:34:09,962
Even Rev. Wallez, who had said 
Hergé was on the right side -

296
00:34:10,167 --> 00:34:16,561
- was arrested as a Nazi sympathizer -
and spent several years in jail.

297
00:34:20,887 --> 00:34:23,845
When the son of man shall come
in all of his glory -

298
00:34:24,047 --> 00:34:27,722
- with all the holy angels,
he will sit on the throne of heaven.

299
00:34:27,927 --> 00:34:32,318
All the nations shall gather before
him and he will separate them -

300
00:34:32,527 --> 00:34:37,078
- as a shepherd divided
the sheep from the goats.

301
00:34:37,287 --> 00:34:40,279
Then shall he say
to those on his left hand:

302
00:34:40,487 --> 00:34:43,877
''Depart from me, ye cursed,
into everlasting fire'' -

303
00:34:44,087 --> 00:34:47,841
- ''prepared for the devil
and his angels.''

304
00:34:48,047 --> 00:34:50,880
''For I was hungered
and ye gave me no meat.''

305
00:34:51,087 --> 00:34:53,806
''I was a stranger
and ye took me not in.''

306
00:34:54,007 --> 00:34:57,886
''I was sick and in prison
and ye visited me not.''

307
00:34:58,087 --> 00:35:03,957
''Verily I say unto you, inasmuch as ye
did it not to one of the least of these-

308
00:35:04,167 --> 00:35:07,921
- ye did it not unto me.''

309
00:35:11,687 --> 00:35:15,600
The liberation was on the 3rd.
Brussels was liberated on the 3rd -

310
00:35:15,807 --> 00:35:19,561
- and on the 3rd, I was in jail.

311
00:35:19,767 --> 00:35:22,600
I was arrested four times.

312
00:35:22,807 --> 00:35:27,323
The various departments didn't talk,
so I was arrested four times -

313
00:35:27,527 --> 00:35:33,602
- but I only spent one night
in prison, then I was released.

314
00:35:33,807 --> 00:35:38,278
But I was blacklisted.

315
00:35:40,247 --> 00:35:45,799
Mr Tintin, he has aged ten years
since this trouble began.

316
00:35:46,007 --> 00:35:51,001
That was in 1945.
All my friends, editors, etc. -

317
00:35:51,207 --> 00:35:57,442
- disappeared. There was no one.
It was fantastic. Unbelievable.

318
00:35:57,647 --> 00:36:01,686
It was an incredible experience
in that no one ...

319
00:36:03,607 --> 00:36:09,125
No one knew me.
But that was how it was.

320
00:36:27,447 --> 00:36:34,000
Hergé, interview no. 2,
October 21, 1971.

321
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:39,244
I have never talked
so much about myself.

322
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:43,406
- But it's interesting.
- I'm not so sure.

323
00:36:43,607 --> 00:36:48,886
But then Raymond Leblanc
got the idea to publish -

324
00:36:49,087 --> 00:36:53,797
- a weekly for kids in 1946.

325
00:36:54,007 --> 00:36:55,326
It was in '46.

326
00:36:55,527 --> 00:36:59,406
I thought the time was right to do
a good illustrated magazine for kids.

327
00:36:59,607 --> 00:37:05,125
He had been in the resistance.
Everyone knew he was clean -

328
00:37:05,327 --> 00:37:07,795
- so he could do anything.

329
00:37:08,007 --> 00:37:12,000
He wasn't suspected of anything.
He asked me to continue Tintin -

330
00:37:12,207 --> 00:37:16,644
- in a new magazine. Superb.

331
00:38:28,607 --> 00:38:31,360
''Dear Georges,
you clearly have talent.''

332
00:38:31,567 --> 00:38:33,762
''You educate the kids
while amusing them.''

333
00:38:33,967 --> 00:38:37,676
''You teach them right and wrong.
That's not so bad.''

334
00:38:37,887 --> 00:38:40,196
''You should be happy.''

335
00:38:40,407 --> 00:38:44,366
''Dear Germaine, I am tired of
always writing the same story.''

336
00:38:44,567 --> 00:38:47,559
''I am tired of churning stories out.''

337
00:38:47,767 --> 00:38:50,520
''I have suffered much since the war.''

338
00:38:50,727 --> 00:38:57,439
''My boy scout spirit has suffered
blows. I see the world differently.''

339
00:38:57,647 --> 00:38:59,365
''Dear Georges'' -

340
00:38:59,567 --> 00:39:03,879
- ''if you won't come home for my
sake, then come home for Tintin's.''

341
00:40:47,647 --> 00:40:52,402
The worries that you experience are
part of the creative process.

342
00:40:52,607 --> 00:40:56,202
You try to find a balance.

343
00:41:02,807 --> 00:41:05,879
In ''Explorers on the Moon'' -

344
00:41:06,087 --> 00:41:13,402
- there are some silly things about
Wolff sacrificing himself at the end.

345
00:41:13,607 --> 00:41:17,919
He writes a note that says:

346
00:41:18,127 --> 00:41:23,247
''When you read these lines,
I will have left the rocket.''

347
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:29,044
''As for myself,
a miracle might save me too.''

348
00:41:29,247 --> 00:41:32,364
Here you see
the influence of the church -

349
00:41:32,567 --> 00:41:36,082
- which the publishers, Casterman,
hastily called in.

350
00:41:36,287 --> 00:41:41,122
It's about suicide, which is
forbidden in the Catholic church -

351
00:41:41,327 --> 00:41:45,718
- and Wolff commits suicide.
''No, he sacrifices himself.''

352
00:41:45,927 --> 00:41:50,557
''No, he commits suicide,
and that is unacceptable.''

353
00:41:50,767 --> 00:41:59,436
''But Jesus let himself be crucified.
Isn't that a sort of suicide?''

354
00:41:59,647 --> 00:42:02,400
''But that's blasphemy!''

355
00:42:04,127 --> 00:42:08,484
Finally I gave up, even though
I knew I'd look like an idiot.

356
00:42:08,687 --> 00:42:14,159
- That's why I put in that rubbish.
- Long live the church.

357
00:42:14,367 --> 00:42:17,518
A miracle, give me a break.

358
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:24,246
Forget all about Theresa of Avila.
The guy is doomed!

359
00:42:25,727 --> 00:42:27,160
I could sense the conflict in him -

360
00:42:28,247 --> 00:42:29,680
I could sense the conflict in him -

361
00:42:29,887 --> 00:42:31,878
- between
the pressure he was under -

362
00:42:32,087 --> 00:42:35,875
- and the desire to be free.

363
00:42:36,087 --> 00:42:43,960
All sorts of pressure,
which went right back to the start.

364
00:42:44,167 --> 00:42:47,318
The pressure was so clear
at that moment -

365
00:42:47,527 --> 00:42:51,725
- that I wanted to ask
something very specific.

366
00:42:51,927 --> 00:42:56,239
Did your wife play a role
in your work?

367
00:42:58,047 --> 00:43:01,323
That's an indiscreet question.

368
00:43:01,527 --> 00:43:05,486
Yes, indirectly. I think.

369
00:43:06,207 --> 00:43:11,918
Indirectly. Not directly
in the actual creative process.

370
00:43:12,127 --> 00:43:17,360
But through her views,
she strengthened -

371
00:43:17,567 --> 00:43:26,157
- a rigidity in me, a certain morality
and my boy scout spirit.

372
00:43:26,367 --> 00:43:32,317
All of this is very obvious
in the Tintin books.

373
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:39,717
She was the Rev. Wallez's secretary.

374
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:47,558
During all that time
I was kept down by Rev. Wallez -

375
00:43:47,767 --> 00:43:53,603
- and by her without knowing it.
I tried to be who I was.

376
00:43:53,807 --> 00:43:57,402
- And you were thirsting for life?
- Yes.

377
00:43:57,607 --> 00:44:00,201
- You hungered after life?
- Yes.

378
00:44:04,647 --> 00:44:08,322
- Did you know Fanny then?
- Yes, she worked here.

379
00:44:08,527 --> 00:44:11,803
She was a colorist.

380
00:44:14,847 --> 00:44:18,317
I had never experienced
anything like it.

381
00:44:18,527 --> 00:44:23,885
It happened imperceptibly.
I don't actually know how.

382
00:44:24,087 --> 00:44:27,966
I didn't see much of the others here.
I preferred working alone.

383
00:44:28,167 --> 00:44:32,922
I saw her once in a while.
She worked here after all.

384
00:44:33,127 --> 00:44:36,483
Something happened.

385
00:44:38,767 --> 00:44:43,158
- That's wonderful.
- It was definitely wonderful.

386
00:44:43,367 --> 00:44:45,927
But it had consequences.

387
00:44:46,127 --> 00:44:49,961
Very dramatic consequences.

388
00:44:53,327 --> 00:44:56,797
I left my wife.
It was an awful experience.

389
00:44:57,007 --> 00:45:01,285
Mostly for her, but also for me.

390
00:45:03,647 --> 00:45:09,563
I had broken my word ...
That was awful, awful.

391
00:45:12,127 --> 00:45:16,086
It was also a drama for me.

392
00:45:21,767 --> 00:45:27,000
I had some terrible dreams.
Everything was white, white, white.

393
00:45:27,207 --> 00:45:30,882
- Fear-filled dreams?
- Yes, very.

394
00:45:46,847 --> 00:45:49,645
I am alone in my house in Ceroux.

395
00:45:49,847 --> 00:45:56,036
I suddenly see some children
in the garden playing in the snow.

396
00:45:56,247 --> 00:46:00,081
I go out to throw some
snowballs at the children -

397
00:46:00,287 --> 00:46:06,635
- but they are gone.
Then I see a black cliff in the snow.

398
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:10,806
I go closer and see the entrance
to a tunnel, which I enter.

399
00:46:11,007 --> 00:46:16,843
At first, it's easy, but the further
I go, the steeper it gets.

400
00:46:17,047 --> 00:46:21,837
Finally I see a light above me
from a dazzling white sky -

401
00:46:22,047 --> 00:46:26,723
- and a snow-covered landscape.

402
00:46:31,447 --> 00:46:33,324
I try to crawl up to get out -

403
00:46:33,527 --> 00:46:38,043
- but some iron bars
keep me imprisoned.

404
00:46:38,247 --> 00:46:41,000
Tchang!

405
00:46:45,127 --> 00:46:47,436
Tchang!

406
00:47:01,607 --> 00:47:04,565
I had to visit a psychiatrist.

407
00:47:04,767 --> 00:47:09,318
He was a student of Jung's,
but as he was dead -

408
00:47:09,527 --> 00:47:14,681
- I got his successor
who lives in Zürich.

409
00:47:21,167 --> 00:47:25,365
I found myself in a condition -

410
00:47:25,567 --> 00:47:30,960
- of intense suffering,
so I wrote my dreams down.

411
00:47:56,287 --> 00:47:58,755
He listened to me with interest -

412
00:47:58,967 --> 00:48:03,757
- but said with regret
that I had to look elsewhere.

413
00:48:06,727 --> 00:48:10,003
''I can't help you.
You hold all the cards.''

414
00:48:10,207 --> 00:48:18,922
''The problem is that you have a
demon in you that you have to kill.''

415
00:48:27,447 --> 00:48:33,795
He told me to exorcise
my white demons. I dreamt in white.

416
00:49:28,527 --> 00:49:34,682
Why do they end up in Tibet?
Why have they travelled that way?

417
00:49:34,887 --> 00:49:38,004
There has to be a reason.

418
00:49:38,207 --> 00:49:43,964
A letter from his old friend Tchang,
who writes that he's coming.

419
00:49:44,167 --> 00:49:49,116
But he doesn't arrive.
He has disappeared.

420
00:50:34,207 --> 00:50:38,485
''Tintin in Tibet'' is really -

421
00:50:38,687 --> 00:50:42,885
- one of the albums that stands out.

422
00:50:43,087 --> 00:50:48,036
It's both a very dramatic
and yet harmonious album.

423
00:50:48,247 --> 00:50:53,765
This drawing is printed
in my consciousness.

424
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:57,926
That's the album there.

425
00:51:13,447 --> 00:51:16,837
The Swiss psychiatrist told me:

426
00:51:17,047 --> 00:51:21,916
''I have to say that you are
obsessed by your work.''

427
00:51:22,127 --> 00:51:25,642
''You'll either have to fight
your way through the crisis'' -

428
00:51:25,847 --> 00:51:29,522
- ''or continue to work.
I would choose the first.''

429
00:51:29,727 --> 00:51:32,605
I did not stop working.

430
00:51:32,807 --> 00:51:36,322
A scout smiles
when there are problems.

431
00:51:36,527 --> 00:51:42,124
That's the Scout's honor.
I continued and I made it.

432
00:51:42,327 --> 00:51:47,162
- That's one way to get on.
- Of course.

433
00:51:49,047 --> 00:51:52,005
It's based on the scout movement.

434
00:51:52,207 --> 00:51:56,519
I had to drive out my inner demon,
the Swiss psychiatrist said.

435
00:51:57,807 --> 00:52:02,722
- Did it work?
- I think so.

436
00:52:04,007 --> 00:52:09,957
I left my wife and had to admit
that I was not perfect.

437
00:52:17,807 --> 00:52:21,117
All this is something
I was not conscious of.

438
00:52:21,327 --> 00:52:23,795
Then came
''The Castafiore Emerald''.

439
00:52:24,007 --> 00:52:27,636
- But that's completely different.
- Yes, very.

440
00:52:30,167 --> 00:52:36,606
- What is your next book about?
- I don't want to say much about that.

441
00:52:36,807 --> 00:52:40,402
It's a secret.
As the Thompson Twins say:

442
00:52:40,607 --> 00:52:43,326
''Our lips are sealed.''

443
00:52:43,527 --> 00:52:48,442
But the plot is simple
and for a change -

444
00:52:48,647 --> 00:52:56,076
- all of the characters stay at home,
at Marlinspike Hall.

445
00:53:01,127 --> 00:53:03,004
My jewels!

446
00:53:32,967 --> 00:53:37,518
It's not deliberate -

447
00:53:37,727 --> 00:53:45,520
- but it's partly my wife I'm
making fun of. I can see that now.

448
00:53:45,727 --> 00:53:49,720
- Is there any resemblance?
- Some.

449
00:54:03,767 --> 00:54:04,007
I have a summer cottage
just outside of Brussels.

450
00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:06,727
I have a summer cottage
just outside of Brussels.

451
00:54:06,727 --> 00:54:11,084
One day, my wife and I were
visited by a brass band -

452
00:54:11,287 --> 00:54:17,396
- from the neighboring village.
They were all rather drunk.

453
00:54:17,607 --> 00:54:22,727
First, they all relieved
themselves in the hedge ...

454
00:54:22,927 --> 00:54:30,277
Then their spokesman said:

455
00:54:30,487 --> 00:54:36,960
''Let's raise our glasses to Spirou!''

456
00:54:42,327 --> 00:54:45,842
That's a good one, no?

457
00:54:46,047 --> 00:54:49,960
Was this before
''The Castafiore Emerald''?

458
00:54:50,167 --> 00:54:55,400
That gave me the idea for
the brass band in Marlinspike Hall.

459
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:14,686
Life is much more
comfortable and spacious.

460
00:55:14,887 --> 00:55:19,358
I feel much closer to other people.

461
00:55:21,207 --> 00:55:28,204
Now that I've left my wife
and accepted my so-called sins -

462
00:55:28,407 --> 00:55:32,923
- life has become much more
comfortable and easier.

463
00:55:36,767 --> 00:55:40,760
The future is terrifying.
The shock of the new.

464
00:55:40,967 --> 00:55:43,800
It scares people.

465
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:53,041
Yet that doesn't mean
one should hide from the world.

466
00:55:53,247 --> 00:55:58,037
Not everything will be bad
in the world to come.

467
00:55:58,247 --> 00:56:04,720
Everything's falling apart. Everything's
falling down. The roof is caving in.

468
00:56:04,927 --> 00:56:09,796
- Things change.
- Yes, and things need to change.

469
00:56:10,007 --> 00:56:15,798
Everything's falling apart.
The entire old world is finished.

470
00:56:16,007 --> 00:56:23,766
Schools, universities ... All
finished. People can't cope anymore.

471
00:56:25,727 --> 00:56:31,438
It explains the violence.
Young people are tired of it all.

472
00:56:31,647 --> 00:56:41,045
And their fashions, their interest in
Eastern philosophy, their drug use ...

473
00:56:41,247 --> 00:56:47,117
It's all a protest against
this incredible apathy -

474
00:56:47,327 --> 00:56:54,961
- which Tintin has always been
against. Tintin is a rebel, isn't he?

475
00:56:55,167 --> 00:56:58,557
- Yes?
- Mr. Hergé?

476
00:56:58,767 --> 00:57:05,366
- Is Tintin on to a new adventure?
- I had started one.

477
00:57:05,567 --> 00:57:09,116
But it's come to a halt -

478
00:57:09,327 --> 00:57:12,842
- as we're doing a new cartoon
instead of a book -

479
00:57:13,047 --> 00:57:18,997
- a version of ''Prisoners of the Sun''.
It's going to be a great cartoon.

480
00:57:19,207 --> 00:57:24,440
That's why Tintin's new adventure
has been temporarily shelved.

481
00:57:24,647 --> 00:57:27,320
People are always asking about that.

482
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:29,802
Especially the publishers.

483
00:57:30,007 --> 00:57:33,124
It's an immense pressure.

484
00:57:33,327 --> 00:57:36,478
- Is he on to a new adventure?
- Before long.

485
00:57:36,687 --> 00:57:39,155
Soon?
- I hope so.

486
00:57:39,367 --> 00:57:41,801
- Next year?
- Maybe.

487
00:57:42,007 --> 00:57:43,440
And your publisher?

488
00:57:43,647 --> 00:57:49,040
He hopes that this commendable
intention will become a reality.

489
00:57:49,247 --> 00:57:53,286
I don't draw as much as I used to,
as it doesn't interest me anymore.

490
00:57:53,487 --> 00:57:58,880
I don't have as many demons
to deal with anymore.

491
00:57:59,087 --> 00:58:05,196
- You've found happiness in idleness?
- Precisely.

492
00:58:08,887 --> 00:58:10,559
Two stars meet -

493
00:58:10,767 --> 00:58:15,238
- Hergé, Tintin's creator, and
the American painter, Andy Warhol -

494
00:58:15,447 --> 00:58:19,235
- also called the ''Pope of Pop Art''.

495
00:59:25,447 --> 00:59:28,007
I wanted to express something -

496
00:59:28,207 --> 00:59:34,476
- and the possibility lay in painting,
which I quickly gave up, because ...

497
00:59:36,127 --> 00:59:38,436
Painting is a whole life -

498
00:59:38,647 --> 00:59:42,606
- and I can't live two lives
when I only have one.

499
00:59:42,807 --> 00:59:46,004
Either comics or painting. Not both.

500
00:59:46,207 --> 00:59:51,327
I would like to paint,
but it would exclude the other.

501
00:59:56,167 --> 01:00:03,847
The adventurous aspect appears
a little childish to me today -

502
01:00:04,047 --> 01:00:08,643
- in relation to what
I would have liked to express.

503
01:00:08,847 --> 01:00:13,443
It's a bit like trying
to shoot a fly with a big gun -

504
01:00:13,647 --> 01:00:16,764
- which is kind of difficult.

505
01:00:16,967 --> 01:00:21,757
Bang, bang. I might have hit
the fly but maybe not.

506
01:00:24,407 --> 01:00:29,527
It's not like Lucky Luke, where
a new album comes out each year.

507
01:00:29,727 --> 01:00:33,845
With Tintin it took
three, four, five, then six years.

508
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:36,117
It took longer and longer.

509
01:00:38,327 --> 01:00:41,524
It was obvious that he would
rather be doing something else.

510
01:00:41,727 --> 01:00:42,847
Maybe that was why he was pleased
I'd come. So he didn't have to work.

511
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:48,047
Maybe that was why he was pleased
I'd come. So he didn't have to work.

512
01:00:48,047 --> 01:00:49,685
Who knows?

513
01:00:49,887 --> 01:00:53,596
I'm sorry that this has taken so long -

514
01:00:53,807 --> 01:00:58,198
- as there's so much more
I'd like to say.

515
01:00:58,407 --> 01:01:06,917
More important things. But that's
how it is. Time has run out.

516
01:01:09,967 --> 01:01:14,165
- Have you any finished drawings?
- No, there aren't any.

517
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:20,840
Although I do have one of the first
ones, which is almost finished.

518
01:01:21,047 --> 01:01:26,280
This is almost finished.
It's a Belgian journalist.

519
01:01:26,487 --> 01:01:30,765
Many go back to ''The Black Island''.
Especially the journalists.

520
01:01:30,967 --> 01:01:36,599
I've collected those I've known, and
those that appeared in the past -

521
01:01:36,807 --> 01:01:43,406
- so that people will recognize
them. It really is rather funny.

522
01:01:43,607 --> 01:01:47,282
All the documentation is here.

523
01:01:51,167 --> 01:01:56,400
I can't stand on my head
and draw at the same time.

524
01:01:56,607 --> 01:02:00,839
There are many different things.

525
01:02:01,047 --> 01:02:05,404
And there's a huge amount of work
between the two stages.

526
01:02:05,607 --> 01:02:10,317
- Why do you still work?
- I enjoy working.

527
01:02:10,527 --> 01:02:13,997
I wouldn't work if I didn't enjoy it.

528
01:02:14,207 --> 01:02:20,760
I'm doing less right now,
because I'm travelling.

529
01:02:20,967 --> 01:02:23,765
But isn't it also to escape?

530
01:02:26,647 --> 01:02:28,797
To avoid working again?

531
01:02:29,007 --> 01:02:33,762
Yes, that's partly true.
In order to avoid this slave labour.

532
01:02:37,167 --> 01:02:43,117
Now I'm going to throw you out.
You must have masses of material.

533
01:02:43,327 --> 01:02:49,926
You must obviously call me
if you're ever in Brussels again.

534
01:02:59,847 --> 01:03:06,082
Maybe I've appeared confused?
- No, it's me that's confused.

535
01:03:06,287 --> 01:03:09,324
And then it was over.

536
01:03:09,527 --> 01:03:15,284
We'd been together for four days,
and now he had to work.

537
01:03:15,487 --> 01:03:19,480
The studio was full of work
demanding his attention.

538
01:03:19,687 --> 01:03:25,319
He said that he had to throw me out.
We couldn't spend an hour more.

539
01:03:25,527 --> 01:03:31,284
It was strange how he clung on to
the transcript of our conversation.

540
01:03:31,487 --> 01:03:36,845
It took two or three years
before the script was ready.

541
01:03:37,047 --> 01:03:40,357
Hergé continued to alter it.

542
01:03:40,567 --> 01:03:44,799
He looked at every single sentence.
He made alterations and additions -

543
01:03:45,007 --> 01:03:48,443
- erasions and deletions.
He sent me the changes -

544
01:03:48,647 --> 01:03:53,243
- I inserted them and sent them
back to him. He wasn't satisfied.

545
01:03:53,447 --> 01:03:58,043
In the space of three years
he rewrote the text four times.

546
01:03:58,247 --> 01:04:04,004
When he'd read the text,
he saw that he had said too much.

547
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:09,201
- so there's a major difference
between the published text -

548
01:04:09,407 --> 01:04:14,845
- and the conversations,
which were recorded on tape.

549
01:04:17,927 --> 01:04:20,999
He was far from content.

550
01:04:21,207 --> 01:04:24,916
He had not found peace.
Far from it.

551
01:04:29,047 --> 01:04:33,325
Hergé spent his entire life
looking for -

552
01:04:33,527 --> 01:04:36,246
- wisdom.

553
01:04:42,207 --> 01:04:46,041
Brussels, June 10, 1973.

554
01:04:46,247 --> 01:04:49,922
''I'm writing because
I'm looking for a Chinese artist'' -

555
01:04:50,127 --> 01:04:52,402
- ''who's called Tchang Tchong-Jen.''

556
01:04:52,607 --> 01:04:57,442
''I've been trying to find
Mr. Tchang Tchong-Jen for years ...''

557
01:05:06,447 --> 01:05:11,077
So whenever we met a Chinaman,
when in Taiwan for example -

558
01:05:11,287 --> 01:05:13,721
- he'd immediately ask:

559
01:05:13,927 --> 01:05:18,603
''You don't know anyone
who knows Tchang Tchong-Jen'' -

560
01:05:18,807 --> 01:05:21,275
- ''a Chinese painter?''

561
01:05:21,487 --> 01:05:24,320
The answer was always the same:
''No, we don't know him.''

562
01:05:24,527 --> 01:05:29,476
It's an achievement having your
friend Tchang here from China ...

563
01:05:29,687 --> 01:05:33,396
I'm a radio and TV journalist,
and I've been fortunate -

564
01:05:33,607 --> 01:05:38,123
- to meet Hergé more than once.
He told me a lot about Tchang.

565
01:05:38,327 --> 01:05:42,479
Tchang disappeared when the war
broke out. He went back to China.

566
01:05:42,687 --> 01:05:46,362
After which,
Communism closed off China -

567
01:05:46,567 --> 01:05:51,163
- and he heard nothing from
his friend for over 45-46 years.

568
01:05:51,367 --> 01:05:58,364
Finally, there was someone
in Brussels, who knew Tchang.

569
01:05:59,927 --> 01:06:02,999
''Tchang Tchong-Jen?
Yes, Shanghai.''

570
01:06:03,207 --> 01:06:05,516
''He is my Godfather.''

571
01:06:05,727 --> 01:06:09,436
It was apparently his Godfather, or
the Godfather of someone he knew.

572
01:06:09,647 --> 01:06:10,447
Hergé had searched
for him in a distant land -

573
01:06:10,447 --> 01:06:13,047
Hergé had searched
for him in a distant land -

574
01:06:13,047 --> 01:06:19,395
- and the answer, as is so often the
case, was there right in front of him.

575
01:06:19,607 --> 01:06:22,917
Nothing can stop a journalist.

576
01:06:23,127 --> 01:06:28,918
I only pressured the Chinese a bit,
as they could slam the door on me.

577
01:06:29,127 --> 01:06:33,643
Then one day I got a call :
''Mr. Tchang is coming.''

578
01:06:35,167 --> 01:06:40,639
Tchang landed in Brussels in front of
the entire international press corps -

579
01:06:40,847 --> 01:06:44,396
- because everyone knew the story.

580
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:47,360
Everyone was happy
about the meeting.

581
01:06:47,567 --> 01:06:52,277
Especially me,
because it was a journalistic scoop.

582
01:07:18,887 --> 01:07:22,800
Time had taken its toll on them.
In addition, Hergé was very ill -

583
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:26,397
- and rather weak at that point.

584
01:07:26,607 --> 01:07:29,565
Given his weakened condition -

585
01:07:29,767 --> 01:07:35,239
- you have to say that
their meeting was heart-breaking.

586
01:07:35,447 --> 01:07:39,235
- Have you read Hergé's books?
- Certainly.

587
01:07:39,447 --> 01:07:41,802
What do you think of them?

588
01:07:43,247 --> 01:07:45,636
I thought of him all the time.

589
01:07:45,847 --> 01:07:48,441
I don't know if Tchang understood it.

590
01:07:48,647 --> 01:07:52,560
They both had to adjust to
the situation and maybe both tried -

591
01:07:52,767 --> 01:07:55,918
- to be as good
as they were in the book.

592
01:07:56,127 --> 01:07:59,881
It was a major media event,
which was covered on TV -

593
01:08:00,087 --> 01:08:02,442
- in the papers and in the press.

594
01:08:02,647 --> 01:08:08,438
He was happy to see Tchang again,
but it was also a marketing event.

595
01:08:08,647 --> 01:08:12,242
How can you describe your feelings -

596
01:08:12,447 --> 01:08:16,679
- when after nearly half a century -

597
01:08:16,887 --> 01:08:21,836
- you rediscover someone
who was more than a friend?

598
01:08:22,047 --> 01:08:26,643
Someone who opened doors
and windows for me.

599
01:08:26,847 --> 01:08:29,998
What was film
and what was reality -

600
01:08:30,207 --> 01:08:34,917
- what was idealized and
what was the truth, I don't know.

601
01:08:35,127 --> 01:08:40,599
Maybe Hergé needed
an idealized friend -

602
01:08:40,807 --> 01:08:48,202
- who could supply an
unambiguously positive meaning -

603
01:08:48,407 --> 01:08:54,277
- to a life that had been shattered
by questions and doubts.

604
01:08:59,847 --> 01:09:02,919
I want to thank our friend Tchang -

605
01:09:03,127 --> 01:09:08,440
- you, Tintin, and you, Hergé, 
who made Tchang your protégé.

606
01:09:08,647 --> 01:09:13,163
All of us, your loyal readers,
send you a giant bubble -

607
01:09:13,367 --> 01:09:17,076
- in the shape of a heart.

608
01:09:22,967 --> 01:09:27,722
Then there's Numa Sadoul.
Are you shy?

609
01:09:27,927 --> 01:09:34,366
It was very odd to sit
and look at this very modest man.

610
01:09:34,567 --> 01:09:38,560
He was shy
because he was celebrated.

611
01:09:38,767 --> 01:09:41,839
He was very ill. It was terrible.

612
01:09:42,047 --> 01:09:45,437
It was a kind
of osteomyelo-fibrosis -

613
01:09:45,647 --> 01:09:51,085
- where the production
of red blood cells stopped.

614
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:57,237
The three years of illness almost
became three years of meditation.

615
01:09:57,447 --> 01:10:00,405
He had a certain radiance.

616
01:10:00,607 --> 01:10:05,362
Something very bright at that time.

617
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:08,923
I remember that
some friends visited him here -

618
01:10:09,127 --> 01:10:12,085
- and when a friend
opened the door, she said:

619
01:10:12,287 --> 01:10:14,926
''Georges, you look like an angel.''

620
01:10:15,127 --> 01:10:18,642
And there really was
something about him -

621
01:10:18,847 --> 01:10:22,203
- that had changed.

622
01:10:22,407 --> 01:10:25,797
He radiated a light.

623
01:10:26,007 --> 01:10:28,202
Good evening.

624
01:10:28,407 --> 01:10:30,637
Georges Remi, alias Hergé,
the creator of Tintin -

625
01:10:30,847 --> 01:10:34,999
- died last night in Brussels
of leukemia, aged 75.

626
01:10:35,207 --> 01:10:39,439
Since February 25th, he had been
at the Saint Luc hospital's -

627
01:10:39,647 --> 01:10:42,445
- heart clinic.

628
01:10:42,647 --> 01:10:46,560
Tonight our newscast will focus
on a series of things ...

629
01:10:46,767 --> 01:10:50,316
Everyone spoke of the clarity
he had recovered.

630
01:10:50,527 --> 01:10:55,362
His secretary, his wife,
his most recent employees.

631
01:10:55,567 --> 01:11:00,038
Everyone that was around him
during his last days.

632
01:11:00,247 --> 01:11:02,681
Was he serene?

633
01:11:02,887 --> 01:11:05,481
I am not so sure.

634
01:11:05,687 --> 01:11:09,965
But he created Tintin.

635
01:11:10,167 --> 01:11:13,239
All of his doubt, his insecurity
and his anxiety ...

636
01:11:13,447 --> 01:11:16,325
He used all of those elements.

637
01:11:16,527 --> 01:11:22,124
He projected them into his books
and made them rich.

638
01:11:49,047 --> 01:11:50,400
