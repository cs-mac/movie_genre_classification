1
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,661
<i>I have no idea
how to tell this story.</i>

2
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,431
<i>I don't even know
how to start it.</i>

3
00:01:08,433 --> 00:01:10,666
<i>Like, I guess I could use
one of those classic</i>

4
00:01:10,668 --> 00:01:13,435
<i>story beginning sentences.</i>

5
00:01:13,437 --> 00:01:16,504
<i>"It was the best of times;
it was the worst of times."</i>

6
00:01:16,506 --> 00:01:19,206
<i>But what would that even mean?</i>

7
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:21,074
<i>I mean, obviously,
somewhere in the world,</i>

8
00:01:21,076 --> 00:01:23,376
<i>it's the best of times
for someone.</i>

9
00:01:23,378 --> 00:01:25,277
<i>Like he's eating all this insane</i>

10
00:01:25,279 --> 00:01:26,811
<i>Vietnamese food
he just got for free...</i>

11
00:01:26,813 --> 00:01:28,813
<i>...and the woman
who delivered the food</i>

12
00:01:28,815 --> 00:01:31,182
<i>looks exactly like the hot
girl from Pussy Riot</i>

13
00:01:31,184 --> 00:01:33,350
<i>and now she's situated
in the corner</i>

14
00:01:33,352 --> 00:01:35,652
<i>playing unspeakably beautiful
melodies on the harp.</i>

15
00:01:35,654 --> 00:01:37,553
<i>While he's just going to town
on that food.</i>

16
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:40,355
<i>So, yeah,
that's the best of times.</i>

17
00:01:40,357 --> 00:01:42,523
<i>Meanwhile, some other guy
is having</i>

18
00:01:42,525 --> 00:01:44,358
<i>his will broken
by professional torturers...</i>

19
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,694
<i>over a crocodile-infested
pool of acid.</i>

20
00:01:47,696 --> 00:01:49,362
<i>And because it's acid,</i>

21
00:01:49,364 --> 00:01:51,430
<i>these crocodiles
are just pissed.</i>

22
00:01:51,432 --> 00:01:53,598
<i>And they're also piping in
that gross smell you get...</i>

23
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,232
<i>...when they spill
a bunch of milk</i>

24
00:01:55,234 --> 00:01:56,399
<i>in the school parking lot.</i>

25
00:01:56,401 --> 00:01:58,267
<i>And this beefy torture dude</i>

26
00:01:58,269 --> 00:02:00,202
<i>is just punching
the hell out of him.</i>

27
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:02,303
<i>Check.</i>

28
00:02:09,743 --> 00:02:13,312
<i>All right, look.
I'll just start.</i>

29
00:02:13,314 --> 00:02:15,347
<i>This is the story of
my senior year of high school</i>

30
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:17,248
<i>and how it destroyed my life.</i>

31
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,284
<i>And how I made a film so bad,
it literally killed someone.</i>

32
00:02:47,443 --> 00:02:49,677
<i>I used to think about it
this way:</i>

33
00:02:49,679 --> 00:02:52,780
<i>Schenley High School
was a world unto itself.</i>

34
00:02:52,782 --> 00:02:55,682
<i>By senior year, I had mastered
the languages and customs</i>

35
00:02:55,684 --> 00:02:56,964
<i>of its various sovereign states.</i>

36
00:02:57,584 --> 00:03:00,319
<i>The head nods of Jock Nation.</i>

37
00:03:00,321 --> 00:03:02,721
<i>The fist bumps
of the Kingdom of Stoners.</i>

38
00:03:02,723 --> 00:03:04,556
<i>The innocuous witticisms of</i>

39
00:03:04,558 --> 00:03:05,757
<i>The People's Republic
of Theater Dorks.</i>

40
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:08,159
Greg, how was your summer?

41
00:03:08,161 --> 00:03:10,227
Summer. What does that word
even mean?

42
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:12,195
Like, more "summ"?

43
00:03:12,197 --> 00:03:13,362
<i>In a typical high school life,</i>

44
00:03:13,364 --> 00:03:15,497
<i>you belong to one nation...</i>

45
00:03:15,499 --> 00:03:17,866
<i>...which can never
guarantee you total security.</i>

46
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:21,181
<i>But I thought
I found a way out.</i>

47
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,771
<i>Get citizenship in every nation.</i>

48
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,173
<i>Get passports to everywhere.</i>

49
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:30,475
<i>Just be on low-key
good terms with everyone...</i>

50
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:32,677
<i>...casually interact with them
once in a while...</i>

51
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,845
<i>...in a way that is invisible
to everyone else.</i>

52
00:03:35,646 --> 00:03:37,513
<i>Never commit to an interaction</i>

53
00:03:37,515 --> 00:03:39,281
<i>that won't be casual or mellow.</i>

54
00:03:39,882 --> 00:03:41,749
Your test was today?

55
00:03:41,751 --> 00:03:43,851
Ugh. Tests!
I've been there.

56
00:03:43,853 --> 00:03:46,620
<i>That's like sending troops
to Afghanistan.</i>

57
00:03:46,622 --> 00:03:48,622
<i>Maintain relationships
with citizens</i>

58
00:03:48,624 --> 00:03:50,223
<i>of the most
dicked-upon nations.</i>

59
00:03:50,225 --> 00:03:52,692
<i>For example, Scott Mayhew,</i>

60
00:03:52,694 --> 00:03:54,727
<i>the gothy dork
I'm sitting next to here.</i>

61
00:03:54,729 --> 00:03:55,861
Scott, nice Berserker.

62
00:03:55,863 --> 00:03:57,696
Thank you?

63
00:03:57,698 --> 00:04:00,198
<i>It took years of cultivation
to win his trust.</i>

64
00:04:03,669 --> 00:04:05,802
<i>Or the universally
ostracized Ill Phil.</i>

65
00:04:09,307 --> 00:04:10,839
<i>Truly a nation of one.</i>

66
00:04:12,442 --> 00:04:16,410
<i>And there were some
places I simply couldn't go.</i>

67
00:04:16,412 --> 00:04:18,879
<i>Like the cafeteria.</i>

68
00:04:18,881 --> 00:04:21,681
<i>Every last square inch of it
was disputed territory.</i>

69
00:04:22,516 --> 00:04:24,450
<i>It was Crimea, Kashmir,</i>

70
00:04:24,452 --> 00:04:26,532
<i>and the Gaza Strip
all rolled into one.</i>

71
00:04:27,553 --> 00:04:30,955
<i>Also the part of
the Indian Ocean with pirates.</i>

72
00:04:30,957 --> 00:04:34,858
Captain Phillips pirates,
not Pirates of the Caribbean.

73
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,493
<i>Although, actually, who knows?
Maybe both.</i>

74
00:04:44,265 --> 00:04:45,632
<i>Instead, I always ate lunch
in the office</i>

75
00:04:45,634 --> 00:04:46,933
<i>of my history teacher.</i>

76
00:04:46,935 --> 00:04:47,967
<i>Mr. McCarthy.</i>

77
00:04:47,969 --> 00:04:49,868
Fact:

78
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,937
I'm in 309 for
the next... 20 minutes.

79
00:04:54,472 --> 00:04:56,840
<i>The only reasonable adult
in all of Schenley.</i>

80
00:04:56,842 --> 00:04:58,374
Heathens.

81
00:04:58,376 --> 00:05:00,309
Respect the research.

82
00:05:00,311 --> 00:05:02,511
<i>With Earl,
whose role in my life</i>

83
00:05:02,513 --> 00:05:05,280
<i>I'm not even gonna try to
explain to you right now.</i>

84
00:05:05,282 --> 00:05:09,784
<i>The harmony of overwhelming
and collective murder.</i>

85
00:05:09,786 --> 00:05:11,886
<i>Hot girls destroy your life.</i>

86
00:05:11,888 --> 00:05:16,023
<i>It doesn't matter if the hot
girl is also a good person.</i>

87
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:18,892
<i>She's a moose,
you're a chipmunk.</i>

88
00:05:18,894 --> 00:05:21,134
<i>She's just wandering through
the forest, oblivious.</i>

89
00:05:22,496 --> 00:05:24,777
<i>And she doesn't even know that
she stomped on your head.</i>

90
00:05:26,898 --> 00:05:28,531
Hey, Madison.

91
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:30,633
Hey, how was your summer?

92
00:05:30,635 --> 00:05:33,268
Summer. What does that word
even mean, right?

93
00:05:33,702 --> 00:05:35,903
More "summ."

94
00:05:35,905 --> 00:05:38,572
Winter, same deal.
More "wint"?

95
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:41,407
McCarthy's in 309.

96
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:43,709
Great, thanks.

97
00:05:43,711 --> 00:05:45,644
<i>To become humbled</i>

98
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:47,612
<i>in front of
this overwhelming misery...</i>

99
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:50,681
<i>...and overwhelming
fornication</i>

100
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,416
<i>and overwhelming lack of order.</i>

101
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:53,650
Titties.

102
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,953
Honey, can we come in?
Jesus, Jesus!

103
00:05:57,955 --> 00:06:00,355
Yeah. What do you want?

104
00:06:00,357 --> 00:06:01,956
First of all,
I was going through...

105
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,425
...your stuff
and I saw that you

106
00:06:04,427 --> 00:06:06,026
have not even unwrapped
your college directory.

107
00:06:06,028 --> 00:06:07,727
Mom, don't go through my stuff.

108
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:10,763
We discussed it, and she gets
to go through your stuff.

109
00:06:10,765 --> 00:06:12,431
Just have a look.
It's fun.

110
00:06:12,433 --> 00:06:13,732
It's like a menu
for your future.

111
00:06:13,734 --> 00:06:16,568
What are you in the mood for?
Some Penn State?

112
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:19,337
Some Pepperdine?
Pomona? Princeton?

113
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:20,538
I'm not getting into Princeton.

114
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,180
He's not getting into Princeton.

115
00:06:22,606 --> 00:06:23,973
Um, so, is that it?

116
00:06:23,975 --> 00:06:25,941
No, honey, it's not it.

117
00:06:25,943 --> 00:06:28,863
Your father and I want to talk to you
about something kind of sad.

118
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:31,779
What?

119
00:06:35,949 --> 00:06:37,749
What happened?

120
00:06:37,751 --> 00:06:39,884
Well, I just got off the phone
with Denise Kushner,

121
00:06:39,886 --> 00:06:42,052
Rachel's mom. You know Denise?

122
00:06:42,054 --> 00:06:43,887
Um, not really.

123
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:45,455
You're friends
with Rachel, though.

124
00:06:45,457 --> 00:06:46,897
Yeah, I mean,
we're like, acquainted.

125
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,423
Come here.

126
00:06:49,925 --> 00:06:50,925
Okay.

127
00:06:57,364 --> 00:06:59,932
Rachel's been diagnosed
with leukemia.

128
00:06:59,934 --> 00:07:01,466
They just found out.

129
00:07:02,968 --> 00:07:04,501
Your test was today?

130
00:07:07,104 --> 00:07:08,838
Ugh. Tests! I've been there.

131
00:07:10,874 --> 00:07:12,374
Oh, God.

132
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,677
Is that serious?

133
00:07:16,679 --> 00:07:17,911
They're doing
all kinds of tests.

134
00:07:17,913 --> 00:07:19,078
They're doing
everything they can.

135
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,646
They just don't know.

136
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,547
Man, that sucks.

137
00:07:22,549 --> 00:07:23,681
You're right.

138
00:07:23,683 --> 00:07:25,816
It sucks.

139
00:07:25,818 --> 00:07:27,784
It sucks really bad.

140
00:07:27,786 --> 00:07:29,585
It sucks quite a bit.

141
00:07:29,886 --> 00:07:30,886
Yeah.

142
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,792
Dad, Cat Stevens is clawing me.

143
00:07:38,794 --> 00:07:40,660
Well, he's deeply distraught.

144
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,695
Well, you know,
I was talking to Denise...

145
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:46,097
...and Denise feels that
you might be someone...

146
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:48,499
...who could make
Rachel feel better.

147
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,001
Yeah, but like I said,

148
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:52,002
we're not really friends, so...

149
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:53,737
Just give Rachel a call.

150
00:07:54,872 --> 00:07:56,539
Yeah, well, what do you
want me to say?

151
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:57,840
"Hey, it's Greg, the guy who's

152
00:07:57,842 --> 00:07:59,242
"never really paid
attention to you...

153
00:07:59,244 --> 00:08:01,577
"...but now you have cancer,
so let's hang out"?

154
00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:02,811
That's not gonna work.

155
00:08:02,813 --> 00:08:03,978
She'll think
you're being sarcastic.

156
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,245
Are you telling me
you can't do

157
00:08:05,247 --> 00:08:07,146
one nice thing
for another person?

158
00:08:07,148 --> 00:08:09,181
I mean, honestly, is that
really what's happening here?

159
00:08:09,183 --> 00:08:11,550
Fine. Okay.

160
00:08:11,552 --> 00:08:13,818
Just, please don't
go through my stuff.

161
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,153
Or I'll start going through
your stuff.

162
00:08:16,155 --> 00:08:18,822
I hope you like tampons.

163
00:08:18,824 --> 00:08:21,758
<i>It's
Central Pittsburgh on 90.5...</i>

164
00:08:24,828 --> 00:08:26,195
<i>This is Rachel.</i>

165
00:08:26,197 --> 00:08:27,930
Hey, it's Greg Gaines.

166
00:08:27,932 --> 00:08:28,932
<i>Hi.</i>

167
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,033
Yo!

168
00:08:32,035 --> 00:08:35,770
So, I called a doctor...

169
00:08:35,772 --> 00:08:38,139
...he said you needed
a prescription of Greg-acil.

170
00:08:38,141 --> 00:08:39,381
<i>What's that?</i>

171
00:08:39,741 --> 00:08:40,981
Uh...

172
00:08:41,242 --> 00:08:42,709
It's me.

173
00:08:44,912 --> 00:08:46,779
In convenient gel-tab form.

174
00:08:47,747 --> 00:08:48,747
<i>Oh.</i>

175
00:08:49,181 --> 00:08:50,781
Yeah.

176
00:08:52,718 --> 00:08:54,217
<i>So, I guess
you heard I'm sick.</i>

177
00:08:54,219 --> 00:08:55,685
Yeah.

178
00:08:55,687 --> 00:08:57,219
<i>Did my mom tell you?</i>

179
00:08:57,221 --> 00:08:59,821
Um, well, my mom told me.

180
00:08:59,823 --> 00:09:00,823
<i>Oh.</i>

181
00:09:01,757 --> 00:09:02,923
So, um...

182
00:09:03,591 --> 00:09:04,891
<i>What?</i>

183
00:09:04,893 --> 00:09:05,925
What?

184
00:09:06,693 --> 00:09:08,026
<i>What were you gonna say?</i>

185
00:09:08,727 --> 00:09:09,760
Um...

186
00:09:11,095 --> 00:09:12,095
<i>Greg, what?</i>

187
00:09:12,097 --> 00:09:14,530
Uh, yeah,
I was just calling to see

188
00:09:14,532 --> 00:09:16,064
if you wanted to hang out.

189
00:09:16,665 --> 00:09:17,798
<i>Right now?</i>

190
00:09:18,232 --> 00:09:19,899
Um, sure.

191
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:21,867
<i>No, thanks.</i>

192
00:09:22,535 --> 00:09:24,102
Oh.

193
00:09:24,104 --> 00:09:26,104
Okay, so you don't
wanna hang out?

194
00:09:26,106 --> 00:09:27,805
<i>No. Thanks anyways.</i>

195
00:09:28,807 --> 00:09:30,908
Okay. Um, bye.

196
00:09:31,276 --> 00:09:32,276
<i>Bye.</i>

197
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:36,078
Mom, what are you doing?

198
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,946
Okay, Mom, listen,
she doesn't want to see me.

199
00:09:37,948 --> 00:09:39,580
I'm sorry to be the one
to tell you, Gregory...

200
00:09:39,582 --> 00:09:40,547
...that you do not
have a choice

201
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:41,981
in this particular matter.

202
00:09:41,983 --> 00:09:43,248
Mom, please, let me say
one thing for one second.

203
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,782
You have been
given an opportunity

204
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,884
to make a very real difference
in someone's life.

205
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:48,285
And if what you're
choosing instead

206
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,319
is to lie around the house
all day...

207
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:51,954
She doesn't want to see me!

208
00:09:51,956 --> 00:09:53,655
...I will be required
to step in...

209
00:09:53,657 --> 00:09:55,757
We're not even friends!

210
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:58,025
...and inform you that
that is 100% unacceptable.

211
00:09:58,027 --> 00:10:00,660
Your nonstop stream of
words is making me freak out!

212
00:10:00,662 --> 00:10:01,994
And if you think that all
these excuses you're making

213
00:10:01,996 --> 00:10:03,695
are in any way better...

214
00:10:03,697 --> 00:10:05,830
...or more important,
than the happiness

215
00:10:05,832 --> 00:10:07,198
of a girl with cancer...

216
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,832
Mom! I am now entering
a subhuman state.

217
00:10:08,834 --> 00:10:10,133
...a friend with cancer,

218
00:10:10,135 --> 00:10:12,001
you are sadly mistaken,
my friend.

219
00:10:13,604 --> 00:10:15,804
You are going to pick up
that phone.

220
00:10:15,806 --> 00:10:18,273
You're going to
call Rachel again.

221
00:10:18,275 --> 00:10:20,195
You are going to.
You are going to.

222
00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:50,236
Oh, Greg.

223
00:10:52,372 --> 00:10:54,139
Oh, Mrs. Kushner.

224
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,073
Denise, Greg.

225
00:10:56,974 --> 00:10:59,041
To you, I'm Denise, okay?

226
00:10:59,043 --> 00:11:01,209
Oh, okay. Good.

227
00:11:01,211 --> 00:11:03,878
You're a real good kid,
you know that?

228
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,013
You really are.
You just have a big heart.

229
00:11:07,048 --> 00:11:08,982
You're kind, nice.

230
00:11:11,151 --> 00:11:12,951
I really appreciate it.

231
00:11:14,086 --> 00:11:15,326
Thank you.

232
00:11:17,722 --> 00:11:20,042
Good, good, good, good, good...

233
00:11:21,858 --> 00:11:22,924
...good boy.

234
00:11:22,926 --> 00:11:24,659
Okay.

235
00:11:24,661 --> 00:11:27,828
You really are kind,
big-hearted, delicious...

236
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,896
...yummy, yummy, young boy.

237
00:11:31,231 --> 00:11:33,999
And you're so, so, handsome.

238
00:11:34,001 --> 00:11:36,668
Oh, I'm not handsome,
but thank you.

239
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,070
And so modest.

240
00:11:39,072 --> 00:11:40,192
I guess I'm a modest mouse.

241
00:11:42,674 --> 00:11:45,108
Greg, where do you come up
with this stuff?

242
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:47,743
Well, that's the name
of a band, actually.

243
00:11:47,745 --> 00:11:49,225
Oh.
Yeah.

244
00:11:49,711 --> 00:11:51,278
Rachel!

245
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,080
I've got a modest little mouse
here to see you!

246
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:56,148
Rachel.

247
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,816
Greg, what are you doing here?

248
00:11:58,951 --> 00:11:59,984
So, uh...

249
00:12:01,186 --> 00:12:02,719
...the doctor
really recommends

250
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:05,054
a strong dosage of Gregitor.

251
00:12:05,056 --> 00:12:06,321
You already used that joke.

252
00:12:06,323 --> 00:12:07,323
No.

253
00:12:08,724 --> 00:12:11,192
No, 'cause last time
it was about Greg-acil...

254
00:12:11,194 --> 00:12:14,094
...which if you recall comes
in convenient gel-tab form.

255
00:12:14,096 --> 00:12:16,162
Look, I don't want you
hanging out with me.

256
00:12:16,164 --> 00:12:17,796
I don't need your stupid pity.

257
00:12:17,798 --> 00:12:18,763
It's fine, you can just go.

258
00:12:18,765 --> 00:12:20,264
No, no.

259
00:12:20,266 --> 00:12:22,866
You got it all wrong. I'm not
here 'cause I pity you.

260
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:25,335
I'm actually here
because my mom is making me.

261
00:12:26,904 --> 00:12:28,404
That's actually worse.

262
00:12:28,406 --> 00:12:30,672
Yeah, I know.

263
00:12:30,674 --> 00:12:34,008
Look, it's okay. Honestly,
I'm fine. Just... just go.

264
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:36,343
Okay, Rachel, just listen
to me for a second.

265
00:12:37,778 --> 00:12:40,312
My mom is gonna turn my life
into a living hell...

266
00:12:40,314 --> 00:12:42,781
...if I don't hang out
with you.

267
00:12:42,783 --> 00:12:46,151
I can't overstate how annoying
she's being about this.

268
00:12:46,153 --> 00:12:48,820
She's basically like
the LeBron James of nagging.

269
00:12:50,956 --> 00:12:52,289
LeBron James plays basketball.

270
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:53,531
I know who LeBron James is.

271
00:12:54,925 --> 00:12:57,993
Look, I know I'm not doing you
any favors here.

272
00:12:57,995 --> 00:13:00,161
What I'm asking is for you
to do me a favor.

273
00:13:00,163 --> 00:13:00,961
You want a favor from me?

274
00:13:01,128 --> 00:13:02,828
Yes.

275
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:05,330
Just let me hang out
with you for one day.

276
00:13:05,332 --> 00:13:07,165
I could tell
my mom we hung out

277
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:09,467
and then we'll just be
out of each other's lives.

278
00:13:10,068 --> 00:13:11,234
Deal?

279
00:13:13,337 --> 00:13:14,337
Deal.

280
00:13:14,971 --> 00:13:16,838
Word.

281
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,273
Is that a Black Power salute?

282
00:13:19,275 --> 00:13:21,041
No, I was going in
for a fist bump.

283
00:13:21,043 --> 00:13:22,175
I can't fist bump you
from up here.

284
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:24,043
Yeah, I realize that.

285
00:13:39,793 --> 00:13:40,859
Books.

286
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,460
Nice.

287
00:13:46,297 --> 00:13:47,330
And, uh...

288
00:13:49,032 --> 00:13:50,332
...tree wallpaper.

289
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,433
That's good.

290
00:13:53,001 --> 00:13:54,001
Why?

291
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:56,002
I don't know.

292
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:25,496
There's a lot of pillows
in here.

293
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:29,366
Mmm-hmm.

294
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,402
Seriously, like, how many...
how many pillows is that?

295
00:14:33,771 --> 00:14:34,871
I don't know.

296
00:14:35,973 --> 00:14:38,140
I wish I had
that many pillows.

297
00:14:38,142 --> 00:14:41,911
So, ask your parents for some.

298
00:14:41,913 --> 00:14:44,246
No, they'd be suspicious
or something.

299
00:14:45,615 --> 00:14:47,582
What, that you'd sleep
all the time?

300
00:14:47,584 --> 00:14:49,584
No. Probably assume

301
00:14:49,586 --> 00:14:51,218
I was gonna masturbate
all over them.

302
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,521
They just have
some gross ideas about me.

303
00:14:54,523 --> 00:14:55,523
But that's on them.

304
00:14:57,191 --> 00:14:59,125
They're always getting
sexy pillows.

305
00:15:01,094 --> 00:15:02,427
This is a nice pillow.

306
00:15:02,429 --> 00:15:03,561
This pillow is a dude,
obviously...

307
00:15:03,563 --> 00:15:05,095
...but it reminds me
of this pillow

308
00:15:05,097 --> 00:15:06,996
we used to have
named Francesca.

309
00:15:06,998 --> 00:15:08,530
They have a similar coloring.

310
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,398
Anyway, Francesca,
we had to eventually

311
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,633
give away because in the end...

312
00:15:12,635 --> 00:15:14,935
...that whole situation
was just a real problem.

313
00:15:14,937 --> 00:15:16,536
It was a mess.

314
00:15:16,538 --> 00:15:18,971
There was a real chemistry

315
00:15:18,973 --> 00:15:21,139
between us both that
I think no one could deny.

316
00:15:22,341 --> 00:15:24,208
I know the world may have
thought it was wrong...

317
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:27,044
...but I think, personally,
the world was wrong...

318
00:15:27,046 --> 00:15:28,945
...about what
could be between...

319
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,481
...a pillow, and a boy...

320
00:15:33,549 --> 00:15:35,049
...who became a man.

321
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,386
Or whatever. I'm just...

322
00:15:41,254 --> 00:15:43,188
...trying to be funny.

323
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:45,589
No, that was good. Thank you.

324
00:15:48,627 --> 00:15:49,659
Oh, shit.

325
00:15:54,064 --> 00:15:56,031
I actually have to go.

326
00:15:56,033 --> 00:15:57,966
That's okay. Who was that?

327
00:15:57,968 --> 00:16:00,435
Sorry. Uh, that was Earl.

328
00:16:00,437 --> 00:16:01,477
Oh, who's Earl?

329
00:16:03,305 --> 00:16:05,039
<i>You may remember Earl
from 15 minutes ago.</i>

330
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,540
Titties.

331
00:16:06,542 --> 00:16:08,475
<i>So, some people think
Earl is my friend,</i>

332
00:16:08,477 --> 00:16:09,676
<i>but he's really not.</i>

333
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:11,577
<i>He's more like a coworker.</i>

334
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:13,211
<i>I've known him
since kindergarten.</i>

335
00:16:13,213 --> 00:16:15,580
<i>His house is
a short walk from mine,</i>

336
00:16:15,582 --> 00:16:17,548
<i>but in a much
tougher neighborhood.</i>

337
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:21,018
<i>His dad is in Texas, his mom
is a depressed shut-in.</i>

338
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,053
<i>And his brother
Derrick's dog Doopie</i>

339
00:16:23,055 --> 00:16:25,055
<i>will definitely eat me someday.</i>

340
00:16:27,024 --> 00:16:28,591
Doopie, Doopie, chill!

341
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,997
<i>So over the years we've
mostly hung out at my place.</i>

342
00:16:36,999 --> 00:16:40,266
<i>Usually with my dad,
a tenured sociology professor.</i>

343
00:16:40,268 --> 00:16:42,501
What you got, cat?
You wanna fight?

344
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:45,103
Didn't think so, punk-ass cat.

345
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:46,971
- Boys!
<i>- His job allows him</i>

346
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:48,472
<i>to be frequently at home
doing nothing.</i>

347
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:50,507
You'll want to pay
close attention to this.

348
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,510
The insane conquistador,
Aguirre,

349
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,178
is raging through the jungle...

350
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,747
...in search of a golden city
that doesn't exist.

351
00:16:57,749 --> 00:16:59,448
<i>The wrath of God.</i>

352
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:02,184
It's a classic
of foreign cinema.

353
00:17:02,186 --> 00:17:03,685
<i>Who else is with me?</i>

354
00:17:05,355 --> 00:17:06,687
<i>In addition to the best films...</i>

355
00:17:06,689 --> 00:17:08,388
This is cuttlefish.

356
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,223
<i>...my house also has
the weirdest food.</i>

357
00:17:10,225 --> 00:17:12,225
A sea creature
much like a squid.

358
00:17:12,227 --> 00:17:14,760
It is a favorite East Asian
snack food.

359
00:17:14,762 --> 00:17:17,062
<i>Obviously we come from
pretty different backgrounds.</i>

360
00:17:17,064 --> 00:17:19,364
<i>But somehow, we like
most of the same things.</i>

361
00:17:19,366 --> 00:17:22,100
Yes, its smell is
odd and repellent

362
00:17:22,102 --> 00:17:23,568
to our Western noses.

363
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:26,070
<i>And we learned pretty early on</i>

364
00:17:26,072 --> 00:17:27,538
<i>that we were the only ones
who liked...</i>

365
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,307
<i>...for example,
classics of foreign cinema.</i>

366
00:17:32,076 --> 00:17:33,543
<i>Why did we like them?</i>

367
00:17:33,545 --> 00:17:35,545
<i>It's hard to say.</i>

368
00:17:35,547 --> 00:17:37,280
<i>Maybe it's that they were
weird and often violent,</i>

369
00:17:37,282 --> 00:17:39,215
<i>like us.</i>

370
00:17:39,217 --> 00:17:41,717
<i>Or confusing and possibly
meaningless, like life.</i>

371
00:17:41,719 --> 00:17:44,352
<i>You can't escape of
this stinkin' camp</i>

372
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:45,553
<i>because you never know
when they call you.</i>

373
00:17:45,555 --> 00:17:49,023
<i>Because you're paid for,
you're under contract.</i>

374
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,493
<i>Anyway,
we liked them so much</i>

375
00:17:53,495 --> 00:17:54,695
<i>we started making our own.</i>

376
00:17:55,562 --> 00:17:57,229
<i>Action!</i>

377
00:17:57,231 --> 00:17:59,097
<i>The idea behind
each one was...</i>

378
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:00,198
<i>...we took a film
that we liked</i>

379
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,699
<i>and made the title stupider.</i>

380
00:18:01,701 --> 00:18:03,267
<i>And then made a new film</i>

381
00:18:03,269 --> 00:18:05,102
<i>to reflect
the new stupid title.</i>

382
00:18:05,104 --> 00:18:07,104
<i>It's a formula that only
produces horrible films...</i>

383
00:18:07,106 --> 00:18:09,606
<i>...but for some reason
we keep using it.</i>

384
00:18:52,812 --> 00:18:55,213
<i>We've made 42 films.</i>

385
00:18:55,215 --> 00:18:56,781
<i>You'd think we'd have stopped
making them by now.</i>

386
00:18:56,783 --> 00:18:58,682
<i>But we haven't.</i>

387
00:18:58,684 --> 00:19:00,417
<i>Honestly, it's like
you can't go anywhere.</i>

388
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:03,219
<i>You can't escape this
stinking place...</i>

389
00:19:03,221 --> 00:19:04,820
<i>...because you don't know
when they call you...</i>

390
00:19:04,822 --> 00:19:08,523
<i>and you're paid to be here,
it's bullshit.</i>

391
00:19:08,525 --> 00:19:10,424
<i>Yeah, and it's like, you know,</i>

392
00:19:10,426 --> 00:19:12,592
<i>I can't do anything.
I'm not a free person.</i>

393
00:19:12,594 --> 00:19:16,395
Truly, one of my favorites
from your oeuvre.

394
00:19:16,397 --> 00:19:19,231
A mature investigation
into the nature of violence.

395
00:19:19,233 --> 00:19:21,533
Dad, for like
the billionth time,

396
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:22,855
you're not allowed
to watch these.

397
00:19:23,769 --> 00:19:25,436
I'm a fan.

398
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:29,273
You gonna go see
that girl again?

399
00:19:30,608 --> 00:19:33,176
I mean, probably, yeah.

400
00:19:33,178 --> 00:19:34,610
You gonna play
with them titties?

401
00:19:34,612 --> 00:19:37,346
No. It's not like that.

402
00:19:37,348 --> 00:19:38,680
Well, that's not right.

403
00:19:38,682 --> 00:19:40,314
I mean, this could be
her last chance on Earth

404
00:19:40,316 --> 00:19:41,648
to be with a man.

405
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,116
Don't make this about you.

406
00:19:43,118 --> 00:19:44,118
Earl!

407
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:47,353
First of all,
if it's that high-stakes,

408
00:19:47,355 --> 00:19:49,355
probably won't even be able
to get a boner.

409
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:52,357
Did I even say shit
about boners?

410
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:54,559
No.

411
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:58,162
What kind of cancer even is
acute myelogenous leukemia?

412
00:19:59,297 --> 00:20:01,531
You know, cancer of the, uh...

413
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,199
...the thing.

414
00:20:05,701 --> 00:20:07,802
<i>It's bullshit!</i>

415
00:20:07,804 --> 00:20:10,871
The Battle of Antietam was
the bloodiest day

416
00:20:10,873 --> 00:20:11,605
in American history.

417
00:20:11,607 --> 00:20:14,674
Class, what do you have to
say for yourselves?

418
00:20:14,676 --> 00:20:15,676
Respect the research.

419
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:19,377
That is what
I'm talking about!

420
00:20:19,379 --> 00:20:21,178
All right, run for your lives.

421
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,060
Save yourselves.
Go, go, go, go, go.

422
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,680
Good work today, everybody.

423
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:28,516
Way to go. Bam.
Love it. Good stuff.

424
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:30,451
Good job.
Excellent work today.

425
00:20:30,453 --> 00:20:32,386
Excellent. Nice job.
Hey, can I talk to you?

426
00:20:32,388 --> 00:20:33,387
Can I talk to you
for a second?

427
00:20:33,389 --> 00:20:35,455
Sure, Greg, what's up?

428
00:20:35,457 --> 00:20:38,925
Uh, do you know
any facts about leukemia?

429
00:20:38,927 --> 00:20:40,626
Leukemia?

430
00:20:40,628 --> 00:20:44,695
Yeah, it's a cancer of the
blood and/or bone marrow.

431
00:20:44,862 --> 00:20:46,562
Why?

432
00:20:46,564 --> 00:20:48,830
Right, so it's pretty
spread out in the body?

433
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:50,665
That is a fact, yes.

434
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:53,300
How soon do
people die from it?

435
00:20:53,302 --> 00:20:54,868
I think it's often
pretty treatable, bud.

436
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,536
Why do you ask?

437
00:20:56,538 --> 00:20:59,472
Well, you know Rachel Kushner
has leukemia, right?

438
00:20:59,474 --> 00:21:00,573
Wait, Rachel has what?

439
00:21:01,608 --> 00:21:03,508
I'm, like,
innovatively stupid.

440
00:21:05,477 --> 00:21:07,945
Everyone was gonna find out
sooner or later.

441
00:21:07,947 --> 00:21:10,280
Just hate having to share
everything about myself.

442
00:21:10,282 --> 00:21:11,522
I'm the exact same way.

443
00:21:12,215 --> 00:21:14,349
You know, one thing you can do

444
00:21:14,351 --> 00:21:15,616
if you don't want to
talk to anyone...

445
00:21:15,618 --> 00:21:17,498
...is just enter
a subhuman state.

446
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:21,854
Here, pretend you're
someone annoying.

447
00:21:28,961 --> 00:21:30,461
"Hi, Rachel.

448
00:21:30,463 --> 00:21:31,903
"I'm really sorry
you have cancer."

449
00:21:45,775 --> 00:21:46,741
Does that ever work?

450
00:21:46,743 --> 00:21:50,745
Yeah, of course.
It works all the time.

451
00:21:50,747 --> 00:21:52,980
It's called passive resistance.

452
00:21:52,982 --> 00:21:55,449
You know, that's what Gandhi
was all about.

453
00:21:55,451 --> 00:21:57,571
I'm pretty sure Gandhi
never did the subhuman thing.

454
00:22:00,554 --> 00:22:03,389
That's how India achieved
statehood. Here, try it.

455
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:08,426
Nope.

456
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:09,668
Come on, it's easy.

457
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,798
Okay. Or another thing
you can do is just

458
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,299
flat-out pretend to be dead.

459
00:22:17,701 --> 00:22:19,435
Say something annoying to me.

460
00:22:19,437 --> 00:22:20,437
Um...

461
00:22:22,338 --> 00:22:24,406
"Hey, Rachel. I just want you
to remember

462
00:22:24,408 --> 00:22:26,374
"that your cancer
is all part of God's plan."

463
00:22:33,014 --> 00:22:34,748
<i>Hey, asshole.</i>

464
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,082
<i>Yeah, over here.</i>

465
00:22:37,117 --> 00:22:38,717
<i>Just so we're straight on this,</i>

466
00:22:38,719 --> 00:22:40,418
<i>you're advising
a girl with cancer...</i>

467
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,420
<i>...to pretend to be dead.</i>

468
00:22:43,622 --> 00:22:45,055
<i>No, seriously.</i>

469
00:22:45,057 --> 00:22:46,990
<i>Think about what you're
doing here, dickhead.</i>

470
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:48,624
<i>I've been doing
my broody Wolverine face on</i>

471
00:22:48,626 --> 00:22:49,925
<i>this girl's wall...</i>

472
00:22:49,927 --> 00:22:51,760
<i>...for 5
and a quarter years,</i>

473
00:22:51,762 --> 00:22:53,061
<i>and at this point, I'm
probably only still here...</i>

474
00:22:53,063 --> 00:22:54,695
<i>...because she'd feel
weirdly guilty</i>

475
00:22:54,697 --> 00:22:56,396
<i>or disloyal taking me down.</i>

476
00:22:56,398 --> 00:22:57,997
<i>But I'm goddamned
if I'm letting</i>

477
00:22:57,999 --> 00:22:59,531
<i>a little punk like you
waltz in here...</i>

478
00:22:59,533 --> 00:23:00,832
<i>...stupiding up the place!</i>

479
00:23:00,834 --> 00:23:02,066
<i>Not on my watch, pal.</i>

480
00:23:02,068 --> 00:23:03,100
Greg, what's wrong?

481
00:23:05,603 --> 00:23:06,903
I'm really sorry.

482
00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:10,406
I shouldn't have told you
to pretend to be dead.

483
00:23:10,408 --> 00:23:11,840
That was really insensitive.

484
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:14,876
I mean, I'm sick.
I'm not dying.

485
00:23:14,878 --> 00:23:17,111
Yeah, I know, but I just...

486
00:23:17,113 --> 00:23:19,379
Now I'm being
all weird about it.

487
00:23:19,381 --> 00:23:21,714
And I can't get un-weird,
'cause I just...

488
00:23:21,716 --> 00:23:23,148
Despite what you said,

489
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,983
I'm clearly still sitting here
thinking...

490
00:23:24,985 --> 00:23:27,345
..."death, death, death,
death, death, death."

491
00:23:39,162 --> 00:23:41,630
That's exactly
what I'm talking about!

492
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:46,567
<i>So if this was
a touching romantic story...</i>

493
00:23:46,569 --> 00:23:47,801
<i>...this is probably
where a new feeling</i>

494
00:23:47,803 --> 00:23:49,002
<i>would wash over me...</i>

495
00:23:49,004 --> 00:23:52,405
<i>and suddenly we would be
furiously making out...</i>

496
00:23:52,407 --> 00:23:54,367
<i>...with the fire
of a thousand suns.</i>

497
00:23:58,777 --> 00:24:00,778
<i>But this isn't
a touching romantic story.</i>

498
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,713
Anyway...
Yep.

499
00:24:02,715 --> 00:24:04,481
<i>But we did still become friends.</i>

500
00:24:12,056 --> 00:24:14,457
Daniel Craig's thing is,
he's got an accent, right?

501
00:24:14,459 --> 00:24:17,193
So he's used to talking with
his mouth in a weird shape...

502
00:24:17,195 --> 00:24:19,595
...which is why he has
pouty lips, like a woman.

503
00:24:19,597 --> 00:24:22,464
Lickable technology, like,
I could text you a sandwich.

504
00:24:22,466 --> 00:24:26,668
There's a button on the nape
of his neck, under the skin.

505
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:29,003
Just push it
if you want him to stop.

506
00:24:29,005 --> 00:24:31,071
Do you believe animals
just live in our house,

507
00:24:31,073 --> 00:24:32,772
and everyone's cool with it?

508
00:24:32,774 --> 00:24:34,673
Like, real animals?

509
00:24:34,675 --> 00:24:36,775
Anyway. You talk now.

510
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:39,610
You mean, talk about cancer?

511
00:24:39,612 --> 00:24:42,045
Only if you want to.

512
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:43,713
The hardest part is
watching my mom

513
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:46,716
trying to deal with it all.

514
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:48,451
And sometimes, I mean,
I do think if it ends up

515
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:50,753
that she's alone
in that house...

516
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:52,488
She has no one. She and my dad
hate each other.

517
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,989
She has no siblings.

518
00:24:53,991 --> 00:24:55,523
I don't know what she'd do.

519
00:24:57,759 --> 00:24:59,126
Don't cry.

520
00:24:59,128 --> 00:25:01,728
I'm not crying.

521
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:03,930
Right, well, you know,
you can cry if you need to.

522
00:25:03,932 --> 00:25:05,652
I thought you said,
"Don't cry."

523
00:25:08,768 --> 00:25:10,135
Me and my dad used to
walk around the block

524
00:25:10,137 --> 00:25:12,670
and count squirrels.

525
00:25:12,672 --> 00:25:14,605
Why? Did he work for, like,
the squirrel census?

526
00:25:14,607 --> 00:25:16,006
No, it was just
something we did

527
00:25:16,008 --> 00:25:18,241
when it was time for us
to spend time together.

528
00:25:18,243 --> 00:25:19,675
We didn't even say anything
while we did it.

529
00:25:19,677 --> 00:25:21,643
All we'd say was stuff like:

530
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,679
"Squirrel, 7."
"Two squirrels, 9."

531
00:25:24,681 --> 00:25:28,482
Jesus. You need to apply
for a dad refund immediately.

532
00:25:28,484 --> 00:25:29,516
What group am I in?

533
00:25:29,518 --> 00:25:30,984
What?

534
00:25:30,986 --> 00:25:32,685
Yesterday you were
saying you'd mapped out

535
00:25:32,687 --> 00:25:33,819
the entire high school by group.

536
00:25:33,821 --> 00:25:35,220
What's my group?

537
00:25:35,222 --> 00:25:37,555
Seriously?
Yeah.

538
00:25:37,557 --> 00:25:40,824
Boring Jewish Senior Girls,
Subgroup 2-A.

539
00:25:42,194 --> 00:25:43,726
Please appreciate
how honest I was just now.

540
00:25:43,728 --> 00:25:44,728
You're an asshole.

541
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,862
What group are you in?

542
00:25:47,864 --> 00:25:51,031
Uh, I'm not
in a group, actually.

543
00:25:51,033 --> 00:25:53,666
I just wouldn't belong to
a group that doesn't suck.

544
00:25:54,634 --> 00:25:57,268
You know,
I'm terminally awkward

545
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,003
and I have a face
like a little groundhog.

546
00:25:59,005 --> 00:26:00,270
So...

547
00:26:00,272 --> 00:26:01,971
You can't really think that.

548
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:04,673
No, I don't think that.

549
00:26:04,675 --> 00:26:06,808
I know that.

550
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:09,911
I just feel like, you know,
for a kid like me...

551
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,615
...in high school,
best case scenario,

552
00:26:14,617 --> 00:26:16,283
just... survive. You know?

553
00:26:16,285 --> 00:26:19,252
Survive without creating
any mortal enemies...

554
00:26:19,254 --> 00:26:21,687
...or hideously embarrassing
yourself forever.

555
00:26:21,689 --> 00:26:24,122
Just survive until college?

556
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,924
College? No. God, college is
going to be even worse.

557
00:26:27,158 --> 00:26:28,925
What?

558
00:26:28,927 --> 00:26:31,661
I mean, at least high school,
it's over at 3:00...

559
00:26:31,663 --> 00:26:34,797
...and it's kids
I mostly know by now.

560
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,665
But college is just gonna be
non-stop strangers.

561
00:26:36,667 --> 00:26:38,166
And some of them
even live in your room.

562
00:26:38,168 --> 00:26:40,701
It's like you can
literally never relax.

563
00:26:40,703 --> 00:26:42,969
I see myself dying of
a panic attack 2 weeks in.

564
00:26:43,904 --> 00:26:45,971
I might just not apply.

565
00:26:45,973 --> 00:26:48,640
That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard you say.

566
00:26:48,642 --> 00:26:50,642
It's probably
not even top 5.

567
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:54,812
And, you know,
high school, college,

568
00:26:54,814 --> 00:26:56,113
we're forced to spend
these years of our lives...

569
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:58,148
...in randomly selected
groups of people

570
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,883
that we have nothing
in common with.

571
00:26:59,885 --> 00:27:01,117
It's a nightmare.

572
00:27:02,152 --> 00:27:04,153
Anyone who says otherwise
is lying.

573
00:27:05,722 --> 00:27:07,055
Congratulations, Greg.

574
00:27:07,057 --> 00:27:08,222
Tomorrow,
you're eating lunch with

575
00:27:08,224 --> 00:27:10,757
Boring Jewish Senior Girls,
Subgroup 2-A.

576
00:27:14,627 --> 00:27:15,867
So where do you usually sit?

577
00:27:18,563 --> 00:27:20,923
It's literally like we're trying
to have lunch in Kandahar.

578
00:27:24,868 --> 00:27:27,903
Rachel, we just found out the
theme for this year's prom:

579
00:27:27,905 --> 00:27:29,871
"A Knight to Remember."

580
00:27:29,873 --> 00:27:31,873
Knight with a "K."
Medieval prom!

581
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:34,075
Isn't prom like
six months away?

582
00:27:34,077 --> 00:27:35,242
Hi, guys. This is Greg,

583
00:27:35,244 --> 00:27:37,244
he's gonna be
sitting with us today.

584
00:27:37,246 --> 00:27:39,779
Anybody need any spoons? No?

585
00:27:42,048 --> 00:27:43,114
Hello.

586
00:27:45,584 --> 00:27:48,218
So, Greg, why are you
sitting with us today?

587
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:50,753
You know, it's lunch.

588
00:27:50,755 --> 00:27:52,988
You gotta eat somewhere.
Can't stand and eat.

589
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:55,924
You and Rachel seem very
friendly, all of a sudden.

590
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,125
Yeah.

591
00:27:58,127 --> 00:27:59,693
You're only talking to her
because she has cancer.

592
00:27:59,695 --> 00:28:01,127
What?

593
00:28:01,129 --> 00:28:03,596
Greg, you hung out
with Rachel once.

594
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:04,897
You're befriending her to
feel good about yourself.

595
00:28:04,899 --> 00:28:06,298
No, I'm not.

596
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,300
Who even does that?

597
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:12,169
You guys mind
if I sit with you?

598
00:28:12,171 --> 00:28:13,171
Of course not.

599
00:28:15,972 --> 00:28:17,372
Sorry, it's a...

600
00:28:17,374 --> 00:28:19,040
It's a pillow.
It's meant to be a baby,

601
00:28:19,042 --> 00:28:20,875
for health class.

602
00:28:20,877 --> 00:28:22,042
You think it's safe here?

603
00:28:22,044 --> 00:28:23,076
A pillow?

604
00:28:24,311 --> 00:28:25,431
Greg, what do you think?

605
00:28:25,979 --> 00:28:27,646
Mmm, I don't know.

606
00:28:27,648 --> 00:28:29,014
Better not get it
too close to me,

607
00:28:29,016 --> 00:28:31,376
otherwise I might just
masturbate onto it.

608
00:28:32,751 --> 00:28:34,471
Ew, Greg,
that's just weird and gross.

609
00:28:39,156 --> 00:28:40,689
Hey, everyone,

610
00:28:40,691 --> 00:28:42,924
check out Scott Mayhew's
Tyrannosaurus walk.

611
00:28:42,926 --> 00:28:45,126
It's a great way to get
from point A to point B.

612
00:28:45,627 --> 00:28:46,994
That was really mean, Greg.

613
00:28:46,996 --> 00:28:48,228
I think he heard you.

614
00:28:54,767 --> 00:28:55,967
<i>And just like that...</i>

615
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:59,703
<i>...eight years
of carefully-cultivated</i>

616
00:28:59,705 --> 00:29:02,005
<i>invisibility... gone.</i>

617
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:03,941
Fin.

618
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:07,342
Your mom made cookies?

619
00:29:07,344 --> 00:29:11,045
Nah, I won them off
of Ill Phil in a game of tonk.

620
00:29:11,047 --> 00:29:14,215
Got tired of whooping
your sorry ass.

621
00:29:14,217 --> 00:29:16,750
Why do they even call it
Scholar Horizons Biology?

622
00:29:16,752 --> 00:29:20,019
Maybe they should call it
Scholar Horizons Tonk.

623
00:29:20,021 --> 00:29:21,520
Or Sometimes Paper Football.

624
00:29:21,522 --> 00:29:23,188
Heathens.

625
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,710
What up?
Hi, Mr. McCarthy.

626
00:29:26,191 --> 00:29:27,191
Wow.

627
00:29:28,393 --> 00:29:32,195
Earl, fact,
that lunch is garbage.

628
00:29:32,197 --> 00:29:35,398
You're literally poisoning
yourself right in front of us.

629
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,166
At least I ain't eating
no funky ass

630
00:29:37,168 --> 00:29:39,868
seaweed-looking tentacle soup.

631
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:42,503
Seriously, this stuff
is the business.

632
00:29:42,505 --> 00:29:44,805
It's Vietnamese.
It's called Pho.

633
00:29:44,807 --> 00:29:46,840
It is "Pho-nomenal."

634
00:29:46,842 --> 00:29:48,042
Well, let me try
some one time.

635
00:29:48,141 --> 00:29:49,141
Mmm.

636
00:29:50,509 --> 00:29:52,209
Now you want to try some?
Yeah.

637
00:29:52,211 --> 00:29:53,977
Well, no.

638
00:29:53,979 --> 00:29:56,245
It's strictly forbidden for me
to give you food.

639
00:29:56,247 --> 00:29:57,379
However, if you go to...

640
00:29:59,148 --> 00:30:01,482
...Thuyen's Super
Saigon Flavor

641
00:30:01,484 --> 00:30:03,083
over in Lawrenceville...

642
00:30:03,085 --> 00:30:05,051
...and ask for Thuyen.

643
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,519
Tell him to put it on my tab.
You'll be all set.

644
00:30:10,523 --> 00:30:12,991
I ain't going to
no damn Lawrenceville.

645
00:30:12,993 --> 00:30:14,258
Fair enough.

646
00:30:16,561 --> 00:30:18,227
You'll have to excuse me.

647
00:30:21,864 --> 00:30:23,197
Boys.

648
00:30:23,199 --> 00:30:24,898
Respect the research.

649
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,900
Respect!

650
00:30:32,938 --> 00:30:34,471
God! You know,
people just assume that

651
00:30:34,473 --> 00:30:36,172
Rachel and I are dating.

652
00:30:36,174 --> 00:30:37,806
It's ruining my life.

653
00:30:37,808 --> 00:30:40,475
Today I threatened to
sexually assault a fake baby.

654
00:30:40,477 --> 00:30:43,110
And I became mortal enemies
with Scott Mayhew.

655
00:30:43,112 --> 00:30:45,352
Both of which
are Rachel's fault.

656
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,014
Sorry, but they just are.

657
00:30:48,016 --> 00:30:50,916
Of course I'm a dick
for complaining about it.

658
00:30:50,918 --> 00:30:53,158
I mean, I am a dick
for complaining about it.

659
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:55,854
I didn't actually mean
any of that.

660
00:30:55,856 --> 00:30:57,288
Better play with them titties.

661
00:31:02,226 --> 00:31:04,706
Does this taste strange to you?

662
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,047
<i>The soup had drugs.</i>

663
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:09,250
Whoa!

664
00:32:14,522 --> 00:32:16,055
McCarthy must've
put weed in that soup

665
00:32:16,057 --> 00:32:17,356
because my brain
is trying to eat itself.

666
00:32:17,358 --> 00:32:18,990
Oh, my God.

667
00:32:18,992 --> 00:32:20,358
I have to go visit
Rachel right now.

668
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,093
Okay, well, you do that.

669
00:32:22,095 --> 00:32:24,161
I'ma be at your house
eatin' up all your dad's food.

670
00:32:24,163 --> 00:32:25,996
No! You have to
come help!

671
00:32:25,998 --> 00:32:27,163
Help with what?

672
00:32:27,165 --> 00:32:28,165
Help!

673
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,067
Hey, in class,
do McCarthy act all, like,

674
00:32:33,069 --> 00:32:34,334
stoned and shit?

675
00:32:35,302 --> 00:32:37,202
Uh, I don't know.
I guess.

676
00:32:37,204 --> 00:32:38,636
Yeah, sometimes.

677
00:32:38,638 --> 00:32:40,537
Well, not sometimes,

678
00:32:40,539 --> 00:32:42,038
but you know what I'm...
You know how he is.

679
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,106
Goddamn, son.

680
00:32:44,108 --> 00:32:46,208
You can't even put a full damn
sentence together.

681
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:49,144
It's insane that Mr. McCarthy
eats soup with drugs in it.

682
00:32:49,146 --> 00:32:51,379
Hey, come on, man,
keep your damn voice down.

683
00:33:03,992 --> 00:33:05,592
We can't tell anyone
we're on drugs.

684
00:33:05,594 --> 00:33:06,993
Why the hell not?

685
00:33:09,396 --> 00:33:11,163
Because then they'll know.

686
00:33:30,514 --> 00:33:33,282
It's my humble little mouse.

687
00:33:33,284 --> 00:33:35,317
And who is
his little mouse friend?

688
00:33:37,286 --> 00:33:39,954
Earl Jackson.

689
00:33:39,956 --> 00:33:43,424
Earl's just my coworker,
and, uh, he's a great guy.

690
00:33:43,426 --> 00:33:45,559
We were just walking around
the neighborhood, you know.

691
00:33:45,561 --> 00:33:48,395
Not really doing anything,

692
00:33:48,397 --> 00:33:49,996
and just wanted
to come say "What's up?"

693
00:33:49,998 --> 00:33:52,231
'Cause Rachel's
about to lose her hair.

694
00:33:52,233 --> 00:33:53,699
Mmm.
So, just wanted to say,

695
00:33:53,701 --> 00:33:57,335
you know,
"Bye, hair. Good riddance."

696
00:33:57,337 --> 00:34:00,037
She's gonna look great without
hair. That's a fact, so...

697
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:02,005
Yeah, I just wanted to say
what's up.

698
00:34:02,007 --> 00:34:05,041
Rachel! We've got
two cute little mouse boys

699
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,923
on our doorstep
that wanna say hi!

700
00:34:10,046 --> 00:34:14,315
Would you two... mice
like a little bit of cheese?

701
00:34:18,386 --> 00:34:19,506
Okay.

702
00:34:26,693 --> 00:34:29,327
I like your room, Rachel.

703
00:34:29,329 --> 00:34:31,629
Thanks. Greg thinks
it's too girly.

704
00:34:31,631 --> 00:34:34,264
No, I love girly,
I think it's fine.

705
00:34:34,266 --> 00:34:35,632
Well,
it ain't too girly.

706
00:34:35,634 --> 00:34:38,434
"Yo, this some
pink puffy bullshit."

707
00:34:38,436 --> 00:34:40,169
I mean, Hello Kitty posters

708
00:34:40,171 --> 00:34:42,437
and chocolate and naked dudes
all over the wall.

709
00:34:42,439 --> 00:34:44,572
They make me want to
throw up for real.

710
00:34:44,574 --> 00:34:47,074
Hey, if you're gonna throw up,
don't do it in here, okay?

711
00:34:47,076 --> 00:34:48,076
This is her room.

712
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:51,511
Anyways.

713
00:34:51,513 --> 00:34:53,833
Rachel, we really just wanted
to see how you was doin'.

714
00:34:54,214 --> 00:34:55,614
Thanks.

715
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:58,283
Yeah, chemotherapy.
That really sucks.

716
00:34:58,285 --> 00:34:59,285
Greg.

717
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:03,454
What the hell, bro?
Don't say it suck, dumb-ass!

718
00:35:03,456 --> 00:35:05,489
It does kinda suck.

719
00:35:05,491 --> 00:35:07,390
Yeah, but I mean, you gotta do
what you gotta do.

720
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,524
Yeah, I guess.

721
00:35:10,493 --> 00:35:11,493
Um...

722
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:15,562
Uh...

723
00:35:15,564 --> 00:35:17,130
Look, you guys can go
if you want.

724
00:35:17,132 --> 00:35:18,631
We're on drugs.
Oh, shit!

725
00:35:18,633 --> 00:35:20,332
Why are you on drugs?

726
00:35:20,334 --> 00:35:21,700
Well, we're accidentally
on drugs.

727
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,201
"Accidentally"?

728
00:35:23,203 --> 00:35:25,169
McCarthy gave us some soup.

729
00:35:25,171 --> 00:35:27,404
Well, McCarthy gave us
some of his,

730
00:35:27,406 --> 00:35:29,339
you know, just regular,
normal soup...

731
00:35:29,341 --> 00:35:30,406
...but then, it was
the last of the soup

732
00:35:30,408 --> 00:35:31,507
so we had to
go get some more...

733
00:35:31,509 --> 00:35:33,575
...from a restaurant,

734
00:35:33,577 --> 00:35:35,343
on the fifth floor
of an office building.

735
00:35:35,345 --> 00:35:36,777
And in the same building,

736
00:35:36,779 --> 00:35:38,145
there was a Jamaican embassy...

737
00:35:38,147 --> 00:35:40,680
...and we ended up
getting trapped

738
00:35:40,682 --> 00:35:42,415
in an elevator
with a Rastafarian guy...

739
00:35:42,417 --> 00:35:45,217
...and he just hotboxed
the whole elevator, so...

740
00:35:45,219 --> 00:35:47,752
We were stuck in there
for, like, 25 minutes...

741
00:35:47,754 --> 00:35:48,686
...and we had to breathe
the weird marijuana air.

742
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,587
Earl, am I right?

743
00:35:50,589 --> 00:35:51,789
That's exactly what happened.

744
00:35:52,822 --> 00:35:55,490
You guys had
quite an adventure.

745
00:35:55,492 --> 00:35:58,125
Being on drugs
just really sucks.

746
00:35:58,127 --> 00:36:00,093
Being around people
on drugs sucks.

747
00:36:00,095 --> 00:36:03,563
This whole situation, really
sorry, just sucks. I'm sorry.

748
00:36:03,565 --> 00:36:06,132
Yo, yo. What the hell
is your problem, man?

749
00:36:06,134 --> 00:36:07,600
All apologetic and shit,

750
00:36:07,602 --> 00:36:09,101
making shit
'bout your sorry ass.

751
00:36:09,103 --> 00:36:11,203
Look, that's not what we came
here to do. Okay?

752
00:36:11,205 --> 00:36:12,404
You wanna help,
you gonna take this girl out

753
00:36:12,406 --> 00:36:13,772
to get some ice cream.

754
00:36:14,774 --> 00:36:16,775
And me, too,
'cause I love that shit.

755
00:36:16,777 --> 00:36:18,109
You like ice cream?

756
00:36:18,111 --> 00:36:19,777
Yeah.

757
00:36:19,779 --> 00:36:21,445
So, you know
Greg from class?

758
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,781
I've known Greg
ever since we were little.

759
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:26,516
You know, I was in
y'all kindergarten, right?

760
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:28,217
Really?

761
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:29,751
Mmm-hmm. I remember you.

762
00:36:29,753 --> 00:36:31,786
You was the girl who called
Justin Jones perverted...

763
00:36:31,788 --> 00:36:34,221
...for showing girls
the birthmark on his butt.

764
00:36:34,223 --> 00:36:35,223
Oh, my God, yes!

765
00:36:35,823 --> 00:36:37,824
Yeah, dude came running up,

766
00:36:37,826 --> 00:36:39,926
showed you his butt.
You were calm.

767
00:36:39,928 --> 00:36:42,495
Said, "Justin, only perverts
show their butts."

768
00:36:42,497 --> 00:36:43,696
I was right there.

769
00:36:43,698 --> 00:36:45,798
I can't believe
you remember that.

770
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,901
You a hero. Shut his
perverted ass right down.

771
00:36:48,903 --> 00:36:50,302
I never forget it.

772
00:36:51,337 --> 00:36:53,438
So you and Greg are coworkers?

773
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,939
Naw, we friends.

774
00:36:54,941 --> 00:36:57,541
He just hates calling people
his friend. Dude's got issues.

775
00:36:57,543 --> 00:37:00,310
Yeah, he does.
What's going on?

776
00:37:00,312 --> 00:37:02,712
Man, I don't even know.
It might be his folks.

777
00:37:02,714 --> 00:37:04,647
I mean, dude's mom
always tellin' him

778
00:37:04,649 --> 00:37:06,782
how handsome he is,
which he ain't.

779
00:37:06,784 --> 00:37:09,484
So now he think he can't trust
anybody close to him.

780
00:37:09,486 --> 00:37:10,918
Dude's weird-ass dad

781
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,387
don't socialize with anybody
'cept the cat.

782
00:37:13,389 --> 00:37:15,856
So that's a role model
ain't got no friends.

783
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:17,624
Bottom line, dude's terrified

784
00:37:17,626 --> 00:37:19,626
of callin' somebody
his friend...

785
00:37:19,628 --> 00:37:21,828
...and they sayin', "Hey, bro,
I'm not your friend."

786
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:23,329
Then he'd have to kill himself.

787
00:37:23,331 --> 00:37:25,297
But how are you coworkers?

788
00:37:25,299 --> 00:37:27,632
We, um, we make films.

789
00:37:27,899 --> 00:37:29,733
Movies?

790
00:37:29,735 --> 00:37:32,502
Yeah. We been making them
for a few years now.

791
00:37:32,504 --> 00:37:34,370
We have, like, 42 in total.

792
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:36,772
Greg! You never told me.

793
00:37:36,774 --> 00:37:38,306
Well, we never told
anybody 'bout them.

794
00:37:38,308 --> 00:37:40,308
They suck.
I mean, they're terrible.

795
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:42,510
I'm pretty sure they don't suck.

796
00:37:42,512 --> 00:37:44,432
Well, you can see
for yourself if you want.

797
00:37:44,779 --> 00:37:46,312
Are you sure?

798
00:37:46,314 --> 00:37:47,313
Hell, yeah,
don't even worry about it.

799
00:37:47,315 --> 00:37:48,480
Just don't tell nobody.

800
00:37:48,482 --> 00:37:49,562
No, of course,
I won't.

801
00:37:51,316 --> 00:37:52,616
All right, son,
get on your feet.

802
00:37:52,618 --> 00:37:53,618
Sounds good.

803
00:37:54,484 --> 00:37:55,750
Where are we going?

804
00:38:23,473 --> 00:38:24,840
We can walk you home.

805
00:38:24,842 --> 00:38:26,274
He needs to recover,

806
00:38:26,276 --> 00:38:28,196
and you probably
should look after him.

807
00:38:29,544 --> 00:38:30,744
Peace, peace.

808
00:38:30,746 --> 00:38:32,586
Thanks.
Bye.

809
00:38:35,448 --> 00:38:37,549
Goddamn it, Earl.

810
00:38:37,551 --> 00:38:39,350
Son, don't even start.

811
00:38:39,352 --> 00:38:40,551
Pig's foot.

812
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:48,324
<i>So, we're pretty far
into this stupid story now...</i>

813
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,626
<i>...and you're probably
saying to yourself,</i>

814
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:52,594
<i>"Hey. I like this girl Rachel.</i>

815
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:55,363
<i>"And I'm gonna be pissed
if she dies at the end."</i>

816
00:38:55,365 --> 00:38:58,399
<i>don't freak out. She survives.</i>

817
00:38:59,634 --> 00:39:01,635
<i>So, hopefully,
that reassures you.</i>

818
00:39:03,571 --> 00:39:05,838
<i>Although, actually,
why would it?</i>

819
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,974
I'm just overwhelmed
with your enthusiasm today.

820
00:39:08,976 --> 00:39:10,442
I guess we're just gonna have
to do it

821
00:39:10,444 --> 00:39:11,943
the old-fashioned way.

822
00:39:12,778 --> 00:39:14,578
I'm thinking of one of you.

823
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,979
I'm not gonna mention
any names,

824
00:39:15,981 --> 00:39:17,814
but your initials...

825
00:39:17,816 --> 00:39:19,549
...are Scott Mayhew.

826
00:39:19,551 --> 00:39:21,584
Greg's been telling everyone

827
00:39:21,586 --> 00:39:23,052
your soup has marijuana in it.

828
00:39:23,054 --> 00:39:24,920
I didn't tell anyone.

829
00:39:24,922 --> 00:39:26,521
I heard you bellowing about it
on public transit.

830
00:39:26,523 --> 00:39:28,022
Is that a fact, Greg?

831
00:39:30,759 --> 00:39:33,861
Look, yesterday,
Earl and I got stoned somehow.

832
00:39:33,863 --> 00:39:35,729
And it was after
we both ate your soup.

833
00:39:35,731 --> 00:39:36,963
And we didn't smoke
any marijuana,

834
00:39:36,965 --> 00:39:38,798
which I have never done, so...

835
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,099
Your soup
must have drugs in it,

836
00:39:40,101 --> 00:39:41,767
'cause that was the only thing
we both ate...

837
00:39:41,769 --> 00:39:43,368
...other than some cookies
we got from Ill Phil,

838
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:44,669
the drug dealer.

839
00:39:46,338 --> 00:39:48,639
Aha.

840
00:39:48,641 --> 00:39:50,974
Man, how did you not know
it was the cookies?

841
00:39:50,976 --> 00:39:53,910
Man, it was your dumb ass
yelling that shit on the bus.

842
00:39:53,912 --> 00:39:55,478
Yo, Greg!

843
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,079
Did you snitch on me?

844
00:39:57,081 --> 00:39:58,513
He did snitch on you!

845
00:39:59,381 --> 00:40:00,681
I was there.

846
00:40:00,683 --> 00:40:02,649
I heard you ridiculing me

847
00:40:02,651 --> 00:40:04,011
in front of
your loathsome harem.

848
00:40:04,851 --> 00:40:07,953
You have made...
a mortal enemy.

849
00:40:07,955 --> 00:40:09,854
And I will never stop
hounding you.

850
00:40:09,856 --> 00:40:12,389
Yeah, you made two mortal
enemies. I stabbed a dude.

851
00:40:12,391 --> 00:40:13,857
Jesus.

852
00:40:46,519 --> 00:40:48,486
So they haven't really
done anything.

853
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:50,688
It's been about a month now.

854
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:53,424
They did say they're never
gonna stop hounding me...

855
00:40:53,426 --> 00:40:55,959
...so, sooner or later...
you know...

856
00:40:55,961 --> 00:40:57,093
...gonna get hounded.

857
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:02,998
Sorry, next time
I'll bring you some flowers.

858
00:41:04,867 --> 00:41:06,934
Though I don't even know
where I'd put them.

859
00:41:06,936 --> 00:41:09,176
It's like, like the only place
left is the barf bucket.

860
00:41:12,138 --> 00:41:13,705
Flowers.

861
00:41:15,541 --> 00:41:16,741
Where you barf.

862
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,013
I like that hat.

863
00:41:25,915 --> 00:41:27,148
It's pretty cute.

864
00:41:32,154 --> 00:41:36,724
Look, I've never been
very beautiful...

865
00:41:36,726 --> 00:41:39,626
...and that's fine because
that's not important to me.

866
00:41:39,927 --> 00:41:41,093
But...

867
00:41:44,163 --> 00:41:45,863
I thought it'd be
easier looking like this.

868
00:41:45,865 --> 00:41:46,997
It's just not.

869
00:41:49,967 --> 00:41:53,002
Everyone comes in here
and sees me...

870
00:41:53,004 --> 00:41:54,970
...and they're
so clearly repulsed.

871
00:41:56,772 --> 00:41:58,772
It's so much harder
than I thought it would be.

872
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,573
Hey, come on.

873
00:42:00,974 --> 00:42:02,507
You look good.

874
00:42:02,509 --> 00:42:06,777
I'm ugly, Greg! I'm so ugly.

875
00:42:06,779 --> 00:42:08,745
Everyone feels like they have
to lie to me and no one

876
00:42:08,747 --> 00:42:11,447
realizes how insulting that is.

877
00:42:11,449 --> 00:42:13,449
Everyone thinks they're
helping, and they're not.

878
00:42:29,097 --> 00:42:30,197
Here.

879
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:32,899
That one's called <i>Mono Rash.</i>

880
00:42:32,901 --> 00:42:35,134
It's based on <i>Rashomon</i>
by Kurosawa.

881
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:36,568
Plot's basically
just Earl killing people

882
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:37,969
'cause he has a rash...

883
00:42:37,971 --> 00:42:40,252
...from mono,
you know, the STD.

884
00:42:42,205 --> 00:42:45,073
Anyway, we're supposed
to go work on

885
00:42:45,075 --> 00:42:47,508
our homage to <i>Apocalypse Now.</i>

886
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:49,576
Ours is called
<i>A Box O' Lips, Wow,</i>

887
00:42:49,578 --> 00:42:51,458
which is even worse
than <i>Mono Rash.</i>

888
00:42:51,878 --> 00:42:53,979
It's a war movie
where these two guys

889
00:42:53,981 --> 00:42:55,647
take part in the unspeakable
brutality of war...

890
00:42:55,649 --> 00:42:57,915
...and then they find
a box of tulips.

891
00:42:57,917 --> 00:43:00,150
Box O' Lips, yeah.
And they're just, "Wow."

892
00:43:00,152 --> 00:43:02,218
They can't get over
how great these tulips are,

893
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,260
it's like,
"A box o' lips, wow!"

894
00:43:04,987 --> 00:43:06,220
The worst part is,
tulips might not

895
00:43:06,222 --> 00:43:07,721
even be in the budget anymore.

896
00:43:10,191 --> 00:43:11,591
I should actually
just stay here

897
00:43:11,593 --> 00:43:12,833
and keep you
from watching that.

898
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:15,727
No! I'm fine. Go make it.

899
00:43:15,729 --> 00:43:16,929
Okay.

900
00:43:19,497 --> 00:43:21,197
Okay. Have fun watching

901
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:23,132
this incredibly terrible movie.

902
00:43:23,134 --> 00:43:25,234
Mmm. Have fun

903
00:43:25,236 --> 00:43:27,276
making the next one.
Mmm-hmm.

904
00:43:49,791 --> 00:43:51,825
Hey, white boy!

905
00:43:51,827 --> 00:43:53,359
Why don't you make me a tulip
'fore I have Doopie come down

906
00:43:53,361 --> 00:43:54,960
there and eat your face?

907
00:43:56,162 --> 00:43:58,196
But no, for real.
Can you make me a tulip?

908
00:43:58,198 --> 00:43:59,931
Oh, my God!
Am I on set right now?

909
00:43:59,933 --> 00:44:01,299
Oh, damn!
Oh, my God!

910
00:44:01,301 --> 00:44:04,001
Ahh! I can't take it!
Action! Cut!

911
00:44:05,169 --> 00:44:07,737
Madison, why are you here?

912
00:44:07,739 --> 00:44:09,205
Rachel said that
I could find you here...

913
00:44:09,207 --> 00:44:11,073
...and your phone was going
straight to voice mail.

914
00:44:11,075 --> 00:44:13,241
Probably 'cause there ain't
no good service down there!

915
00:44:13,243 --> 00:44:15,243
But I had to get here
'cause I had to let you know.

916
00:44:15,245 --> 00:44:17,912
So, I was visiting Rachel,
and I was giving her a card...

917
00:44:17,914 --> 00:44:20,247
...and she was watching
one of your secret movies.

918
00:44:20,249 --> 00:44:21,848
Oh, my God.
Wait, did you see any of it?

919
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:23,216
No! No, she turned it
off immediately.

920
00:44:23,218 --> 00:44:24,850
It was good, it was good.

921
00:44:24,852 --> 00:44:26,084
You know,
you're both Japanese, and...

922
00:44:26,086 --> 00:44:27,752
...Earl beheaded you,
and, but then,

923
00:44:27,754 --> 00:44:29,420
she, like, turned it off.

924
00:44:29,422 --> 00:44:31,955
But I had a brainstorm. Okay?
I had an amazing brainstorm.

925
00:44:31,957 --> 00:44:35,057
I realized... you need to
make a film for Rachel.

926
00:44:36,426 --> 00:44:39,060
What do you think?

927
00:44:39,062 --> 00:44:40,995
It would be like her favorite
thing in the entire world...

928
00:44:40,997 --> 00:44:43,157
...and it's like the most
important thing you could do.

929
00:44:43,198 --> 00:44:44,731
You have to do it.

930
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:50,302
Yeah, word.

931
00:44:50,304 --> 00:44:52,404
"Word"? Like, word,
you'll do it, word?

932
00:45:00,177 --> 00:45:01,710
Yep.

933
00:45:01,712 --> 00:45:02,944
Oh, my God, awesome!

934
00:45:02,946 --> 00:45:04,211
Okay, well,
I can't wait to see it.

935
00:45:04,213 --> 00:45:05,453
Um, okay, I gotta go, but...

936
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,400
Cut!

937
00:45:08,248 --> 00:45:09,488
That's a wrap!

938
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:10,915
Rolling!

939
00:45:11,916 --> 00:45:13,216
Titties.

940
00:45:13,218 --> 00:45:14,684
Goddamn it!

941
00:45:15,352 --> 00:45:16,952
<i>In the next few weeks,</i>

942
00:45:16,954 --> 00:45:19,154
<i>did I start
making that movie? No.</i>

943
00:45:19,156 --> 00:45:21,089
<i>Because I didn't agree
to make that movie.</i>

944
00:45:21,091 --> 00:45:23,224
<i>All I said was, "Word."</i>

945
00:45:23,226 --> 00:45:25,226
<i>"Word" could mean anything.</i>

946
00:45:25,228 --> 00:45:26,694
<i>Plus, we had at least
a month or two...</i>

947
00:45:26,696 --> 00:45:30,130
<i>all the terrible films
we'd already made.</i>

948
00:45:30,132 --> 00:45:32,999
<i>For example,</i>
A Sockwork Orange.

949
00:45:58,224 --> 00:45:59,323
"Droogle"?

950
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:02,491
It's Google for droogs.

951
00:46:03,726 --> 00:46:05,860
What's that?

952
00:46:05,862 --> 00:46:07,502
Nothing, just the bane
of my existence.

953
00:46:09,331 --> 00:46:11,031
Which my mom is forcing me
to carry around

954
00:46:11,033 --> 00:46:12,332
until I apply
to some colleges.

955
00:46:14,068 --> 00:46:15,835
She says it's like a menu

956
00:46:15,837 --> 00:46:16,902
for my future,
and I was, like, "Sure.

957
00:46:16,904 --> 00:46:19,037
"A menu that only has food

958
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:21,272
"that will humiliate me
for 4 years."

959
00:46:21,274 --> 00:46:25,042
You have to be less
of an idiot about college.

960
00:46:25,044 --> 00:46:27,277
Listen, even if you think
people won't like you...

961
00:46:27,279 --> 00:46:30,380
...which is literally
an insane thing to think...

962
00:46:30,382 --> 00:46:32,181
...you're way less exposed
to people in college.

963
00:46:32,183 --> 00:46:34,950
High school is 40 hours
of class a week.

964
00:46:34,952 --> 00:46:37,919
College is, like, 15 and 20.

965
00:46:37,921 --> 00:46:39,053
And if you don't want to
live with other people,

966
00:46:39,055 --> 00:46:41,355
then go to Pittsburgh State.

967
00:46:41,357 --> 00:46:43,423
Live at home.

968
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:46,292
It's better than
sitting college out

969
00:46:46,294 --> 00:46:47,814
because you irrationally
hate yourself.

970
00:46:48,161 --> 00:46:50,228
Not irrationally, though.

971
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:51,495
Apply to Pittsburgh State.

972
00:46:52,763 --> 00:46:55,931
Right now. Apply early.

973
00:46:55,933 --> 00:46:58,900
Come on. Do it in front of me.
Apply to Pittsburgh State.

974
00:46:58,902 --> 00:47:00,142
What if I say no?

975
00:47:01,936 --> 00:47:03,870
I have stage 4 cancer.

976
00:47:06,206 --> 00:47:08,273
So that would be a pretty
dick move. Come on.

977
00:47:08,275 --> 00:47:09,275
Fine.

978
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:20,182
"Why I want to
go... to college."

979
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,387
By Werner Herzog.

980
00:47:28,256 --> 00:47:29,356
The highly selective

981
00:47:29,358 --> 00:47:31,257
admissions process...

982
00:47:31,259 --> 00:47:34,260
...weeds out the cruel
and the stupid.

983
00:47:34,262 --> 00:47:37,830
So college is unlike
the senseless chaos...

984
00:47:37,832 --> 00:47:41,400
...and sickening enormity
of high school.

985
00:47:41,402 --> 00:47:44,836
High school is the mouth
of a great demon...

986
00:47:44,838 --> 00:47:46,571
...biting and chewing

987
00:47:46,573 --> 00:47:48,005
and smushing people in the face.

988
00:47:49,374 --> 00:47:52,008
It is simply overwhelming.

989
00:47:55,846 --> 00:47:57,513
In all seriousness,

990
00:47:57,515 --> 00:47:59,481
I am looking forward
to college...

991
00:47:59,483 --> 00:48:02,250
...because I didn't really
fit in in high school,

992
00:48:02,252 --> 00:48:03,084
because of my weird
rodent face...

993
00:48:03,086 --> 00:48:04,585
No.

994
00:48:04,587 --> 00:48:07,354
...and a habit of saying
the dumbest possible shit.

995
00:48:07,356 --> 00:48:08,988
No!

996
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:12,057
The sheer pastiness
of my complexion...

997
00:48:12,059 --> 00:48:16,194
...overwhelms all who behold
it with existential nausea.

998
00:48:16,196 --> 00:48:20,464
"In high school, I never
truly felt comfortable...

999
00:48:21,132 --> 00:48:22,866
"...in my own skin.

1000
00:48:22,868 --> 00:48:24,968
"In fact,
I've always been someone...

1001
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:29,505
"...who doesn't
really like themselves.

1002
00:48:29,507 --> 00:48:33,609
"But I think that's because I
have some growing up to do...

1003
00:48:33,611 --> 00:48:37,478
"...and college is the place
where I'm going to do it."

1004
00:48:41,015 --> 00:48:42,315
That's way too personal.

1005
00:48:46,553 --> 00:48:47,953
Fine, if you want to
see this again...

1006
00:48:47,955 --> 00:48:49,487
Okay! Okay!

1007
00:48:50,489 --> 00:48:52,623
But only because cancer.

1008
00:48:54,092 --> 00:48:56,426
And you know what? You have to
do this too now. Here.

1009
00:48:57,461 --> 00:48:59,128
Page through this huge,
horrible book

1010
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:00,395
and find some colleges.

1011
00:49:00,397 --> 00:49:01,637
That's yours now.

1012
00:49:03,031 --> 00:49:05,312
Mmm. It's like a menu
for your future.

1013
00:49:09,369 --> 00:49:11,236
Can I finish my movie first?

1014
00:51:32,626 --> 00:51:34,460
So,
if we make this film,

1015
00:51:34,462 --> 00:51:35,542
people are gonna be, like:

1016
00:51:35,995 --> 00:51:37,228
"Oh, Greg and Earl,

1017
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:39,029
"they're those weird filmmakers.

1018
00:51:39,031 --> 00:51:40,764
"They're always
creepily filming stuff.

1019
00:51:40,766 --> 00:51:42,365
"They'll probably sneak into
your house one night

1020
00:51:42,367 --> 00:51:43,733
"and film you
while you're sleeping."

1021
00:51:43,735 --> 00:51:45,234
But people probably
already think that,

1022
00:51:45,236 --> 00:51:48,737
So now, I've become
completely conspicuous,

1023
00:51:48,739 --> 00:51:50,305
like all the time.

1024
00:51:50,307 --> 00:51:51,639
People look at me and think,

1025
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:53,007
"Filmmaker."
The hell even is this?

1026
00:51:53,009 --> 00:51:54,008
When they're not
already thinking,

1027
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:55,242
"Cancer girl's boyfriend."

1028
00:51:55,244 --> 00:51:56,509
It tastes like a dog's
funky-ass butthole.

1029
00:51:56,511 --> 00:51:58,111
Furthermore,
we agreed to do a film

1030
00:51:58,113 --> 00:51:59,545
that we have no idea
what it should look like...

1031
00:51:59,547 --> 00:52:01,547
...or sound like, or even be.

1032
00:52:01,549 --> 00:52:02,648
I mean,
what the hell sort of film

1033
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:04,816
should we even make? Huh?

1034
00:52:04,818 --> 00:52:06,818
I mean, what was I thinking?

1035
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:07,819
You were thinking
that girl Madison

1036
00:52:07,821 --> 00:52:09,320
had nice titties.

1037
00:52:09,322 --> 00:52:10,521
I mean,
I like the titties too,

1038
00:52:10,523 --> 00:52:12,389
but now you got a problem.

1039
00:52:12,391 --> 00:52:13,656
'Cause I ain't agreed
to do this shit.

1040
00:52:13,658 --> 00:52:14,658
You did.

1041
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:18,626
Are you not gonna
help me make this?

1042
00:52:18,628 --> 00:52:20,661
The hell we gonna make, son?

1043
00:52:20,663 --> 00:52:23,263
<i>They want fresh inspiration.</i>

1044
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:24,631
I must tell you,
the richest inspiration

1045
00:52:24,633 --> 00:52:26,733
I have ever known was...

1046
00:52:26,735 --> 00:52:29,235
...during my period of
quarantine in the Amazon.

1047
00:52:30,471 --> 00:52:32,270
Where I
and a half dozen other...

1048
00:52:32,272 --> 00:52:34,605
...unfortunates
had nothing to watch...

1049
00:52:34,607 --> 00:52:38,508
...but the bristling,
leviathan tarantula...

1050
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:41,677
...bunched up on
the rotting, flimsy thatch...

1051
00:52:41,679 --> 00:52:43,559
...perhaps 8 feet
above our faces.

1052
00:52:44,246 --> 00:52:47,314
Spiders the size of your fist.

1053
00:52:47,316 --> 00:52:49,783
Their fangs glistening
with venom and...

1054
00:52:49,785 --> 00:52:51,584
...their thousand-fold
black eyes

1055
00:52:51,586 --> 00:52:53,886
shining dully in the gloom.

1056
00:52:53,888 --> 00:52:55,354
In the darkness,
you would hear

1057
00:52:55,356 --> 00:52:57,356
the sudden anguished hiss...

1058
00:52:57,358 --> 00:53:00,292
...of a spider being struck
by an adult leopard wasp...

1059
00:53:00,294 --> 00:53:01,593
...and in their
mortal struggle,

1060
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:02,894
they would plummet
to one's bed...

1061
00:53:02,896 --> 00:53:05,529
...biting and stinging
and thrashing...

1062
00:53:07,498 --> 00:53:09,338
You know that you can
smoke a hornet?

1063
00:53:11,234 --> 00:53:13,535
Okay, so just look at me
when you answer the questions.

1064
00:53:13,537 --> 00:53:15,337
Don't worry
about the camera, all right?

1065
00:53:16,471 --> 00:53:18,605
Okay, Denise.

1066
00:53:18,607 --> 00:53:20,888
Tell me a little
about Rachel's birth.

1067
00:53:21,208 --> 00:53:22,675
Uh, Rachel's birth.

1068
00:53:23,443 --> 00:53:24,876
What an ordeal that was.

1069
00:53:27,545 --> 00:53:29,913
Greg, just...
let me tell you one thing.

1070
00:53:31,482 --> 00:53:32,915
I was a really good mom
to her, you know?

1071
00:53:32,917 --> 00:53:35,183
I really was.

1072
00:53:35,185 --> 00:53:37,585
Some single moms,
their kids grow up too fast...

1073
00:53:37,587 --> 00:53:39,353
...but I always tried to
protect Rachel from that.

1074
00:53:39,355 --> 00:53:41,675
I did my very best
to protect her from...

1075
00:53:43,524 --> 00:53:45,324
...growing up too quickly,
you know?

1076
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,393
Right.

1077
00:53:48,395 --> 00:53:50,261
And now,
I'm learning that there are...

1078
00:53:52,531 --> 00:53:55,231
protect your kid from,
you know?

1079
00:53:56,967 --> 00:53:59,007
No matter what you do,
you just...

1080
00:54:05,807 --> 00:54:09,309
So, did she have
any favorite toys?

1081
00:54:09,311 --> 00:54:11,311
Before I answer that question,
this is serious...

1082
00:54:12,946 --> 00:54:15,347
...so use your ears
and listen to me.

1083
00:54:16,682 --> 00:54:18,215
I want you
to promise me something

1084
00:54:18,217 --> 00:54:19,816
as I care about you.

1085
00:54:19,818 --> 00:54:21,484
You gotta promise me you're
not gonna have a baby...

1086
00:54:21,486 --> 00:54:22,685
...unless you're ready to love

1087
00:54:22,687 --> 00:54:23,886
that baby's mother
your whole life...

1088
00:54:23,888 --> 00:54:25,520
...and this is serious.

1089
00:54:25,522 --> 00:54:28,789
I'm telling you something
that nobody's gonna tell you.

1090
00:54:28,791 --> 00:54:32,292
Don't pick a girl
who's push-pull, you know?

1091
00:54:32,294 --> 00:54:34,774
You wanna pick somebody
who's gonna love you...

1092
00:54:35,529 --> 00:54:38,230
...and not forget you,
and not...

1093
00:54:38,232 --> 00:54:40,665
...leave you for someone
with a big, fat ass.

1094
00:54:41,533 --> 00:54:43,300
So, no favorite toy.

1095
00:54:43,868 --> 00:54:44,767
Um...

1096
00:54:44,769 --> 00:54:47,936
Oh, you want to know what?
Here's a favorite toy.

1097
00:54:47,938 --> 00:54:49,470
Scissors.

1098
00:54:49,472 --> 00:54:51,472
When Rachel's father
first left...

1099
00:54:51,474 --> 00:54:52,840
...she gathered up
all his books,

1100
00:54:52,842 --> 00:54:56,877
...and she rounded 'em up
and she cut them right up.

1101
00:54:56,879 --> 00:54:57,911
Please, don't tell her
I'm telling you,

1102
00:54:57,913 --> 00:54:59,612
she would chop my head off.

1103
00:54:59,614 --> 00:55:02,381
But she just...

1104
00:55:02,383 --> 00:55:04,416
And I was, like, "Atta girl."

1105
00:55:04,418 --> 00:55:07,752
Snip, snip, snip.
She was very mad.

1106
00:55:07,754 --> 00:55:10,254
Can we take a little break
and have a little taste?

1107
00:55:10,256 --> 00:55:11,755
You boys are old enough
to have a little taste, right?

1108
00:55:11,757 --> 00:55:13,877
Can we take a teeny break,
just have a little taste?

1109
00:55:15,625 --> 00:55:18,360
Oh, yeah, that's a good boy.

1110
00:55:18,362 --> 00:55:20,962
Greg, will you join us?

1111
00:55:20,964 --> 00:55:22,797
Oh, I'm okay.

1112
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:25,299
Oh, come on,
don't be a party pooper!

1113
00:55:28,036 --> 00:55:30,303
Now we can get back
to our interview.

1114
00:55:31,538 --> 00:55:32,571
So, basically,
this whole setup

1115
00:55:32,573 --> 00:55:33,972
is so that, you know...

1116
00:55:33,974 --> 00:55:35,840
...I can talk to you,
you can talk to me...

1117
00:55:35,842 --> 00:55:38,442
...and I can see you,
and you can see me.

1118
00:55:38,444 --> 00:55:39,676
Except it's not really me,
it's a phone.

1119
00:55:39,678 --> 00:55:41,377
And I know that
sounds kind of weird,

1120
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:43,445
but it's not.

1121
00:55:43,447 --> 00:55:45,980
So, anyway, just treat it
like a get-well card,

1122
00:55:45,982 --> 00:55:47,514
you can look into the lens.

1123
00:55:47,516 --> 00:55:49,349
And, uh...

1124
00:55:49,351 --> 00:55:51,284
Yeah, it's a video,
so you know...

1125
00:55:51,286 --> 00:55:52,351
...don't think about it
too hard,

1126
00:55:52,353 --> 00:55:54,286
but just make it good.

1127
00:55:54,288 --> 00:55:55,654
Start whenever you're ready.

1128
00:55:55,656 --> 00:55:57,355
Hi, Rachel.

1129
00:55:57,357 --> 00:55:59,724
I guess I don't really
know you that well...

1130
00:55:59,726 --> 00:56:01,859
...but I believe in you.
You can do it.

1131
00:56:01,861 --> 00:56:03,827
That's real nice, yo.

1132
00:56:03,829 --> 00:56:05,662
It's so sweet
that your boyfriend

1133
00:56:05,664 --> 00:56:07,397
is doing this for you.

1134
00:56:07,399 --> 00:56:08,931
He must really love you.

1135
00:56:08,933 --> 00:56:10,766
Girl, that ain't her boyfriend.

1136
00:56:10,768 --> 00:56:12,567
Oh.

1137
00:56:12,569 --> 00:56:14,602
<i>I know you're Jewish,
but I just wanted you to know</i>

1138
00:56:14,604 --> 00:56:16,670
<i>that God has a plan for you.</i>

1139
00:56:16,672 --> 00:56:17,771
<i>You seem like
a really cool person.</i>

1140
00:56:17,773 --> 00:56:19,539
<i>I know we don't really talk.</i>

1141
00:56:19,541 --> 00:56:22,608
<i>But you've got
a lot of friends. And, uh...</i>

1142
00:56:22,610 --> 00:56:23,508
<i>Out of all the people
in this school,</i>

1143
00:56:23,510 --> 00:56:25,843
<i>I don't hate you.</i>

1144
00:56:25,845 --> 00:56:27,845
<i>I believe in you
and you can do it.</i>

1145
00:56:28,479 --> 00:56:29,979
<i>You can do it.</i>

1146
00:56:29,981 --> 00:56:31,513
<i>I believe in you.</i>

1147
00:56:32,047 --> 00:56:33,580
<i>You can do it.</i>

1148
00:56:33,582 --> 00:56:34,781
Damn.

1149
00:57:00,069 --> 00:57:01,903
<i>So again,</i>

1150
00:57:01,905 --> 00:57:03,738
<i>if this was a touching,
romantic story...</i>

1151
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:05,906
<i>...we'd obviously fall in love</i>

1152
00:57:05,908 --> 00:57:07,641
<i>and she'd say all the wise,
beautiful things...</i>

1153
00:57:07,643 --> 00:57:10,777
<i>in life's twilight or whatever.</i>

1154
00:57:10,779 --> 00:57:12,645
<i>And then she'd die in my arms.</i>

1155
00:57:18,117 --> 00:57:20,718
<i>But again,
that's not what happened.</i>

1156
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:23,687
<i>She just got quieter.
And unhappier.</i>

1157
00:57:24,855 --> 00:57:26,422
So, how are you?

1158
00:57:27,557 --> 00:57:28,757
For real.

1159
00:57:30,359 --> 00:57:31,559
For real?

1160
00:57:33,461 --> 00:57:35,094
Feeling like
you might have been right.

1161
00:57:38,631 --> 00:57:39,871
Right when?

1162
00:57:41,066 --> 00:57:42,699
Back in October.

1163
00:57:43,801 --> 00:57:45,902
When you thought I was dying.

1164
00:57:52,141 --> 00:57:54,508
Well, I mean,
I regret thinking that.

1165
00:57:56,711 --> 00:57:57,977
Don't regret it.

1166
00:58:18,562 --> 00:58:20,496
What is that noise?

1167
00:58:20,498 --> 00:58:22,096
It's Regretful Polar Bear.

1168
00:58:25,567 --> 00:58:27,100
Polar Bears have
the purest expression

1169
00:58:27,102 --> 00:58:29,542
of regret in the animal kingdom.

1170
00:58:30,604 --> 00:58:33,238
Just listen to how haunting
and plaintive they sound.

1171
00:58:36,709 --> 00:58:39,642
Don't make me laugh.
Please. It kinda hurts.

1172
00:58:41,177 --> 00:58:42,417
All right.

1173
00:58:52,988 --> 00:58:55,428
Kind of a monster
silence in here.

1174
00:58:57,624 --> 00:58:58,624
Yeah.

1175
00:59:01,093 --> 00:59:03,227
It's okay to just be silent
for a while.

1176
00:59:06,097 --> 00:59:07,997
<i>Look,</i>

1177
00:59:07,999 --> 00:59:09,832
<i>I know you're really
bracing for this sweet girl...</i>

1178
00:59:09,834 --> 00:59:12,568
<i>...that you probably
like a lot to die.</i>

1179
00:59:12,570 --> 00:59:15,871
<i>Just please bear with me.
She doesn't. She gets better.</i>

1180
00:59:15,873 --> 00:59:17,739
<i>I promise.</i>

1181
00:59:56,911 --> 00:59:59,178
<i>Pretty much all I remember
from that winter...</i>

1182
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:01,013
<i>...is working on
that stupid film...</i>

1183
01:00:01,015 --> 01:00:04,249
<i>that made some kind of sense...</i>

1184
01:00:04,251 --> 01:00:05,917
<i>...and knowing the whole time
that I couldn't...</i>

1185
01:00:05,919 --> 01:00:09,220
<i>to make the thing
we wanted to make...</i>

1186
01:00:09,222 --> 01:00:11,222
<i>...but it wasn't
possible for us.</i>

1187
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:14,891
<i>That was
an entire winter of my life.</i>

1188
01:00:19,262 --> 01:00:20,762
<i>I mean, obviously,</i>

1189
01:00:20,764 --> 01:00:22,524
<i>I remember visiting Rachel too.</i>

1190
01:00:24,599 --> 01:00:25,865
<i>Sometimes she talked,</i>

1191
01:00:25,867 --> 01:00:27,766
<i>and sometimes,
she didn't want to.</i>

1192
01:00:29,068 --> 01:00:31,102
<i>When she didn't want to,
I talked.</i>

1193
01:00:31,104 --> 01:00:32,770
<i>Or we watched movies.</i>

1194
01:00:33,271 --> 01:00:34,391
<i>Sometimes, she laughed.</i>

1195
01:00:36,106 --> 01:00:37,339
<i>Sometimes, she didn't.</i>

1196
01:00:43,378 --> 01:00:45,946
<i>What I don't remember
is doing schoolwork.</i>

1197
01:00:48,783 --> 01:00:50,943
<i>I did literally zero
schoolwork during this time.</i>

1198
01:00:57,623 --> 01:00:58,623
<i>Not figuratively.</i>

1199
01:00:59,657 --> 01:01:01,958
<i>Literally zero schoolwork.</i>

1200
01:01:06,697 --> 01:01:08,617
<i>That's actually
sort of hard to do.</i>

1201
01:01:27,984 --> 01:01:29,851
So, what's going on at school?

1202
01:01:32,821 --> 01:01:34,955
Well, right now,
the whole school looks like a castle...

1203
01:01:34,957 --> 01:01:36,957
...'cause everyone's
getting ready

1204
01:01:36,959 --> 01:01:38,199
for Medieval Prom.

1205
01:01:40,961 --> 01:01:43,762
I guess everyone's trying
to figure out how to, like...

1206
01:01:43,764 --> 01:01:45,004
...twerk medievally?

1207
01:01:46,798 --> 01:01:48,131
Are you going?

1208
01:01:48,133 --> 01:01:49,365
No, of course not.

1209
01:01:49,367 --> 01:01:51,066
You should go.

1210
01:01:51,068 --> 01:01:52,400
No way!

1211
01:01:53,435 --> 01:01:55,235
Have you seen me in a tux?

1212
01:01:57,204 --> 01:01:59,438
It's like when they make
a dog wear human clothes.

1213
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,106
Have you seen that?

1214
01:02:01,108 --> 01:02:03,408
It just makes you
really sad to look at.

1215
01:02:06,445 --> 01:02:09,046
Oh, and I don't have
anyone to go with.

1216
01:02:09,048 --> 01:02:10,288
So there's that.

1217
01:02:15,385 --> 01:02:17,386
Unless...

1218
01:02:17,388 --> 01:02:19,121
...you know...
you wanted to...

1219
01:02:19,123 --> 01:02:21,089
Greg, I'm not going to prom.

1220
01:02:21,091 --> 01:02:23,124
I mean, you totally could.

1221
01:02:23,126 --> 01:02:24,892
It could be like a,
awesome statement.

1222
01:02:25,226 --> 01:02:27,026
Hey, uh...

1223
01:02:27,028 --> 01:02:29,761
When are you guys
finishing your movie?

1224
01:02:33,165 --> 01:02:35,365
You don't know we're working
on a movie right now.

1225
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:37,333
You don't have to pretend.

1226
01:02:37,335 --> 01:02:39,934
Earl told me you guys
were making a movie for me.

1227
01:02:42,737 --> 01:02:43,903
God, yeah...

1228
01:02:45,305 --> 01:02:46,905
I guess he probably did.

1229
01:02:48,007 --> 01:02:49,173
I was just asking, because...

1230
01:02:49,175 --> 01:02:51,208
Goddamn it, Earl! Ugh.

1231
01:02:51,210 --> 01:02:53,410
It was just, it was
supposed to be a surprise!

1232
01:02:54,311 --> 01:02:56,278
You know? It's taking forever

1233
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:57,812
because we really want
to get it right, and...

1234
01:02:57,814 --> 01:03:00,447
I'm probably gonna
stop treatment pretty soon.

1235
01:03:05,352 --> 01:03:06,592
What?

1236
01:03:10,856 --> 01:03:12,823
It just isn't
doing me any good.

1237
01:03:12,825 --> 01:03:14,791
All it's doing
is making me sicker.

1238
01:03:23,867 --> 01:03:26,235
Yeah, but it...
I mean, if you stop, then...

1239
01:03:26,237 --> 01:03:28,136
Well, we'll just
see what happens.

1240
01:03:30,106 --> 01:03:32,172
Well, we know
what's gonna happen, right?

1241
01:03:44,982 --> 01:03:46,848
I know who
you can take to prom.

1242
01:03:49,818 --> 01:03:50,938
Who?

1243
01:03:53,354 --> 01:03:54,987
This sexy pillow here.

1244
01:03:54,989 --> 01:03:56,088
Oh, my God, can you just...

1245
01:03:56,090 --> 01:03:57,989
Ooh, Greg,

1246
01:03:57,991 --> 01:03:59,123
this pillow's name is Francesca.

1247
01:03:59,125 --> 01:04:00,290
Don't joke,
I can't deal with that.

1248
01:04:00,292 --> 01:04:01,324
She's a filthy Italian woman.

1249
01:04:01,326 --> 01:04:02,566
Please, stop!

1250
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:05,994
Don't yell at me.

1251
01:04:05,996 --> 01:04:07,495
So, that's it?
Just, to hell with college,

1252
01:04:07,497 --> 01:04:08,429
to hell with growing up?

1253
01:04:08,431 --> 01:04:09,997
Greg, don't.

1254
01:04:09,999 --> 01:04:11,264
Rachel, what the hell
is wrong with you?

1255
01:04:11,266 --> 01:04:12,832
This is your life!

1256
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,967
Yeah, it is my life.

1257
01:04:17,069 --> 01:04:19,270
It's me who has to
lie in bed all day,

1258
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:20,471
with a shaved head...

1259
01:04:20,473 --> 01:04:22,473
...getting weaker and uglier,

1260
01:04:22,475 --> 01:04:26,143
and more miserable,
with no hope in sight.

1261
01:04:26,145 --> 01:04:27,811
I'm the one who
has to suffer through this,

1262
01:04:27,813 --> 01:04:29,813
not you, so don't yell at me.

1263
01:04:32,449 --> 01:04:34,783
I'm sorry,
but I'm not gonna sit here

1264
01:04:34,785 --> 01:04:37,185
and get comfortable
watching you die.

1265
01:04:38,821 --> 01:04:40,981
Okay? I'm not.
I'm not gonna do that.

1266
01:04:41,256 --> 01:04:42,990
So don't ask me to.

1267
01:04:44,258 --> 01:04:46,125
If you can't accept
that I'm going to do

1268
01:04:46,127 --> 01:04:48,160
what I want to do
with my life...

1269
01:04:49,462 --> 01:04:51,095
...then you're
a terrible friend.

1270
01:04:52,931 --> 01:04:54,464
I'm a terrible friend?

1271
01:04:54,466 --> 01:04:55,431
Okay.

1272
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:58,100
You know,
I'm not the one giving up.

1273
01:04:58,102 --> 01:04:59,401
I'm not ruining
my friend's life

1274
01:04:59,403 --> 01:05:01,102
by giving up
on the whole world.

1275
01:05:01,104 --> 01:05:03,070
Oh, please, Greg,
you should be overjoyed.

1276
01:05:03,072 --> 01:05:04,337
Now you can
go back to your life

1277
01:05:04,339 --> 01:05:06,572
of being invisible
and detached...

1278
01:05:06,574 --> 01:05:08,273
...and self-hating.

1279
01:05:10,976 --> 01:05:12,056
Yeah.

1280
01:05:13,511 --> 01:05:15,671
And you can go back
to your life of being dead.

1281
01:05:17,547 --> 01:05:19,414
Nice. Really nice.

1282
01:05:25,587 --> 01:05:27,287
This is gonna kill your mom.

1283
01:05:31,358 --> 01:05:33,558
Have you gotten
comfortable with that?

1284
01:05:37,397 --> 01:05:39,531
That doesn't
bother you anymore?

1285
01:05:39,533 --> 01:05:40,565
Thinking about your mom?

1286
01:05:40,567 --> 01:05:41,933
Get outta here, Greg.

1287
01:05:41,935 --> 01:05:43,601
You've done your time.

1288
01:05:43,603 --> 01:05:45,923
You don't have to hang around
with the sick girl anymore.

1289
01:05:49,374 --> 01:05:51,814
How can you even
say that to me?

1290
01:05:52,476 --> 01:05:55,244
Your mom forced you
to hang out with me.

1291
01:05:55,246 --> 01:05:57,012
Earl forced you
to show me your movies.

1292
01:05:57,014 --> 01:05:59,180
Madison forced you
to make a movie about me.

1293
01:05:59,182 --> 01:06:01,282
So, what part of this
did you actually want to do?

1294
01:06:21,434 --> 01:06:23,735
Just... Just do something
nice for me for once

1295
01:06:23,737 --> 01:06:25,436
and just get out.

1296
01:06:51,228 --> 01:06:53,028
<i>Earl!</i>

1297
01:06:53,030 --> 01:06:55,430
This is it!
You've gone too far!

1298
01:06:55,432 --> 01:06:56,631
You've leaked
the unleakable secret

1299
01:06:56,633 --> 01:06:58,299
because you hold nothing sacred.

1300
01:06:58,301 --> 01:06:59,366
'Cause you're a dickhead!

1301
01:06:59,368 --> 01:07:00,633
The foundation of any

1302
01:07:00,635 --> 01:07:02,468
good working partnership
is trust...

1303
01:07:02,470 --> 01:07:04,236
...and I can no longer
trust you in anyway.

1304
01:07:04,238 --> 01:07:05,604
You'll leak anything to anyone.

1305
01:07:05,606 --> 01:07:07,172
It's like working
with Julian Assange.

1306
01:07:07,174 --> 01:07:09,107
Assangde. Ass-andge.
Damn it!

1307
01:07:22,621 --> 01:07:24,722
The hell you want?

1308
01:07:24,724 --> 01:07:26,764
Just waiting for Earl.
Awright, awright.

1309
01:07:27,425 --> 01:07:29,292
Whassup, boy?
You gonna come in?

1310
01:07:29,294 --> 01:07:31,527
So, Rachel told me that
you told her about the, uh...

1311
01:07:31,529 --> 01:07:33,649
...about the film
that we're making for her.

1312
01:07:34,730 --> 01:07:36,697
You're like Julian Assange, man.

1313
01:07:36,699 --> 01:07:38,331
It's like you always do this...

1314
01:07:38,333 --> 01:07:39,665
I don't know,
'cause you, like,

1315
01:07:39,667 --> 01:07:41,299
wanna be a better friend
than me or something?

1316
01:07:41,301 --> 01:07:42,433
I don't know if I can
work with you again

1317
01:07:42,435 --> 01:07:43,534
after you sell me out
like a dick!

1318
01:07:43,536 --> 01:07:45,602
Oh, okay. Watch out, yo.

1319
01:07:47,037 --> 01:07:49,271
Hey, yo,
shut your ass up, man!

1320
01:07:49,273 --> 01:07:50,572
Like you care so much about
what other people think,

1321
01:07:50,574 --> 01:07:51,706
boy, you go around here...

1322
01:07:51,708 --> 01:07:53,174
...kissin' everybody ass,

1323
01:07:53,176 --> 01:07:56,610
Look, nobody
gives a shit about you, Greg!

1324
01:07:56,612 --> 01:07:57,677
All right? Nobody give a shit!

1325
01:07:57,679 --> 01:07:59,378
Whoop his ass!

1326
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:01,546
And then the one girl
who do actually care about you...

1327
01:08:01,548 --> 01:08:02,747
...you wanna come
over here and

1328
01:08:02,749 --> 01:08:05,483
bitch and whine
about some films, yo? Huh?

1329
01:08:05,485 --> 01:08:07,785
Because somebody
actually cares about you?

1330
01:08:07,787 --> 01:08:09,353
Like, damn,
I'm so tired of you

1331
01:08:09,355 --> 01:08:11,188
treating this girl
like she a burden.

1332
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:13,089
You know,
her life is over after this!

1333
01:08:13,091 --> 01:08:14,457
And you want to come over here

1334
01:08:14,459 --> 01:08:17,526
bitchin' and whinin' about
some irrelevant bullshit!

1335
01:08:17,528 --> 01:08:19,394
Like, yo, you so close to me
knocking your shit loose right now, son!

1336
01:08:19,396 --> 01:08:20,762
Go for it!

1337
01:08:20,764 --> 01:08:23,831
Yeah, I don't care!
You want me to hit you now?

1338
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:25,632
Yeah, Earl, I want you to!

1339
01:08:25,634 --> 01:08:28,034
That's right! Jack that
little dude up there!

1340
01:08:32,804 --> 01:08:34,437
See, Greg?

1341
01:08:34,439 --> 01:08:37,273
You lucky that was him
and not me out there...

1342
01:08:37,275 --> 01:08:39,308
...'cause I'd have been
whooping your ass up and down this street.

1343
01:08:39,310 --> 01:08:41,670
It'd have been a ass-whoopin'
fest around here, you dig?

1344
01:08:50,351 --> 01:08:53,252
So what's the status
on the 20-pager on Nixon?

1345
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:58,155
Uh, I need another extension.

1346
01:08:58,157 --> 01:09:00,257
That might prove difficult...

1347
01:09:00,259 --> 01:09:02,826
...seeing how it's the...

1348
01:09:02,828 --> 01:09:04,628
...the end of the quarter
and all.

1349
01:09:05,195 --> 01:09:07,762
Yeah, I've just been busy.

1350
01:09:09,865 --> 01:09:11,565
You know, I heard...

1351
01:09:15,269 --> 01:09:16,509
...about Rachel.

1352
01:09:17,671 --> 01:09:19,204
How you holding up?

1353
01:09:23,441 --> 01:09:24,681
You know...

1354
01:09:25,743 --> 01:09:27,210
...not great.

1355
01:09:32,883 --> 01:09:36,619
You know, my dad died
when I was 15, Greg.

1356
01:09:36,621 --> 01:09:39,321
A couple years
younger than you.

1357
01:09:39,323 --> 01:09:41,823
You know, the thing is that,
when I was a kid...

1358
01:09:42,858 --> 01:09:45,626
...I really,
I really can only remember

1359
01:09:45,628 --> 01:09:47,728
thinking about him as this...

1360
01:09:47,730 --> 01:09:50,597
...you know, big,
kind of like asshole guy.

1361
01:09:52,499 --> 01:09:54,633
At his wake,
these buddies of his

1362
01:09:54,635 --> 01:09:55,900
kept coming up to me...

1363
01:09:55,902 --> 01:09:58,802
...and telling me
these stories about him.

1364
01:09:58,804 --> 01:10:00,804
And it was like
they were talking about

1365
01:10:00,806 --> 01:10:02,472
some complete other guy.

1366
01:10:04,208 --> 01:10:05,641
To give you an example.

1367
01:10:06,776 --> 01:10:09,711
He knew every single
European pop song

1368
01:10:09,713 --> 01:10:11,345
from the 1970s.

1369
01:10:13,481 --> 01:10:14,814
He'd memorize these songs,

1370
01:10:14,816 --> 01:10:16,882
and he'd do that
so he could go...

1371
01:10:16,884 --> 01:10:19,417
...and sing them
to German girls in bars.

1372
01:10:20,552 --> 01:10:22,219
He had a go-to,

1373
01:10:22,221 --> 01:10:24,354
his number one
go-to song. It was a...

1374
01:10:25,756 --> 01:10:29,491
It was a Dutch song.
It was called Ding-a-Dong.

1375
01:10:31,694 --> 01:10:34,762
My dad used to sing that
to German girls in bars.

1376
01:10:36,231 --> 01:10:37,664
That's a fact.

1377
01:10:41,502 --> 01:10:43,169
So what does that mean?

1378
01:10:46,206 --> 01:10:48,566
Well, Greg, I think that
it just means that...

1379
01:10:49,908 --> 01:10:51,875
...even after somebody dies,
you can...

1380
01:10:53,377 --> 01:10:55,497
...you can still
keep learning about them.

1381
01:10:56,479 --> 01:10:58,847
You know, their life.

1382
01:11:01,350 --> 01:11:03,851
It can keep unfolding
itself to you just as long...

1383
01:11:05,453 --> 01:11:07,693
...just as long as
you pay attention to it.

1384
01:11:08,956 --> 01:11:10,389
Are you seriously
trying to turn this

1385
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:12,557
into some stupid sappy lesson?

1386
01:11:14,926 --> 01:11:16,626
You're a good kid, Greg.

1387
01:11:16,628 --> 01:11:18,828
No! Look, I'm going home.

1388
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:23,365
See, I'm cutting class
right in front of you. 'Kay?

1389
01:11:23,367 --> 01:11:25,700
I'm not a good kid. I'm not.

1390
01:11:42,884 --> 01:11:43,884
Okay.

1391
01:11:44,985 --> 01:11:47,252
Earl came by earlier
to drop something off...

1392
01:11:47,254 --> 01:11:49,354
...but he turned down
this superb

1393
01:11:49,356 --> 01:11:51,522
Andouille rabbit sausage...

1394
01:11:51,524 --> 01:11:53,257
...which is quite unlike him.

1395
01:11:54,492 --> 01:11:55,792
Is everything all right?

1396
01:11:57,394 --> 01:11:58,494
Buddy?

1397
01:12:17,579 --> 01:12:18,812
<i>We tried
a lot of different ways</i>

1398
01:12:18,814 --> 01:12:20,847
<i>of making a film for you...</i>

1399
01:12:20,849 --> 01:12:23,583
<i>...but they were all
too goofy or irrelevant...</i>

1400
01:12:23,585 --> 01:12:25,551
<i>...or just not what we wanted.</i>

1401
01:12:25,553 --> 01:12:27,619
<i>So, now I'm gonna
talk to you directly.</i>

1402
01:12:28,487 --> 01:12:30,287
<i>Um...</i>

1403
01:12:30,289 --> 01:12:32,689
<i>All right, I'm gonna be
honest here. Okay?</i>

1404
01:12:32,691 --> 01:12:35,024
<i>Sometimes, white girls
are particularly stupid.</i>

1405
01:12:35,026 --> 01:12:39,495
<i>I mean, everybody's stupid,
but white girls, you know...</i>

1406
01:12:39,497 --> 01:12:41,263
<i>They think
they better than everybody</i>

1407
01:12:41,265 --> 01:12:43,265
<i>and self-centered
and pretend they not.</i>

1408
01:12:43,267 --> 01:12:45,600
<i>But...</i>

1409
01:12:45,602 --> 01:12:47,522
<i>you aren't like that,
you know. Um...</i>

1410
01:12:48,336 --> 01:12:50,437
<i>It's just crazy
how patient you've been.</i>

1411
01:12:50,439 --> 01:12:52,639
<i>You know, I know if it was me
that had cancer, uh...</i>

1412
01:12:53,773 --> 01:12:56,474
<i>...I'd be upset and angry</i>

1413
01:12:56,476 --> 01:12:59,510
<i>and trying to beat
everybody's ass half the time.</i>

1414
01:12:59,512 --> 01:13:02,613
<i>So I'm just, I'm just amazed
at how patient you've been.</i>

1415
01:13:05,283 --> 01:13:07,050
<i>You, you make me feel blessed.</i>

1416
01:13:17,428 --> 01:13:20,762
<i>By Michael Powell
and Emeric Pressburger.</i>

1417
01:13:22,465 --> 01:13:23,864
<i>I think, ultimately,
what one has to understand</i>

1418
01:13:23,866 --> 01:13:25,599
<i>watching this film...</i>

1419
01:13:25,601 --> 01:13:27,934
<i>...it's a very special
piece of filmmaking.</i>

1420
01:13:27,936 --> 01:13:29,869
Oh.

1421
01:13:29,871 --> 01:13:31,503
Are you eating lunch
in here still?

1422
01:13:32,672 --> 01:13:34,939
Not if you are.

1423
01:13:34,941 --> 01:13:36,981
Well, I'm not eating
lunch in here if you are.

1424
01:13:37,709 --> 01:13:40,577
Good,
'cause I like it in here.

1425
01:13:40,579 --> 01:13:42,512
So I guess I could just go.

1426
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:44,580
Or you could go.

1427
01:13:45,548 --> 01:13:48,149
No, I like
the air-conditioner.

1428
01:13:48,151 --> 01:13:50,151
And I like
the comfortable chair.

1429
01:13:53,855 --> 01:13:55,922
Yeah, I like those too.

1430
01:13:57,057 --> 01:13:59,158
Sounds like your damn problem.

1431
01:14:01,628 --> 01:14:03,929
<i>Which showed
one film per week...</i>

1432
01:14:03,931 --> 01:14:06,097
<i>...twice a night,
and 3 times on Saturday.</i>

1433
01:14:07,165 --> 01:14:09,032
<i>In a way,
Tales of Hoffmann is...</i>

1434
01:14:09,034 --> 01:14:13,436
<i>...the culmination of
Powell-Pressburger's work...</i>

1435
01:14:13,438 --> 01:14:15,638
<i>...with what they call
the composed film.</i>

1436
01:14:36,925 --> 01:14:38,792
Hey!

1437
01:14:38,794 --> 01:14:40,114
Can I talk to you
about the movie?

1438
01:14:40,527 --> 01:14:41,793
Um...

1439
01:14:41,795 --> 01:14:43,761
Yeah, it's not done yet.

1440
01:14:43,763 --> 01:14:44,828
Greg, you guys
have been working on it

1441
01:14:44,830 --> 01:14:45,995
for like 4 months.

1442
01:14:47,530 --> 01:14:49,631
Yeah, well...

1443
01:14:49,633 --> 01:14:50,565
I don't know,
we tried a bunch of stuff

1444
01:14:50,567 --> 01:14:52,133
and it just...

1445
01:14:52,834 --> 01:14:54,067
...didn't really work.

1446
01:14:54,069 --> 01:14:54,967
It's not that good.

1447
01:14:54,969 --> 01:14:56,668
Greg!

1448
01:14:56,670 --> 01:14:59,103
Now is not the time for your
"I'm Greg, I suck,

1449
01:14:59,105 --> 01:15:00,771
"nothing I do
is any good" thing.

1450
01:15:00,773 --> 01:15:02,072
I'm sure what you have
is awesome

1451
01:15:02,074 --> 01:15:04,107
and I think she would
really benefit...

1452
01:15:04,109 --> 01:15:06,149
...if you just got it done
and gave it to her.

1453
01:15:07,176 --> 01:15:08,875
Madison,
she stopped treatment.

1454
01:15:12,079 --> 01:15:13,279
She gave up.

1455
01:15:15,248 --> 01:15:16,748
She quit.

1456
01:15:19,151 --> 01:15:20,684
Well, I guess
that's a really good reason

1457
01:15:20,686 --> 01:15:21,951
to just finish
the fucking movie.

1458
01:15:21,953 --> 01:15:23,152
And give it to her.

1459
01:15:25,555 --> 01:15:26,721
But whatever.

1460
01:15:39,735 --> 01:15:40,968
Honey?

1461
01:15:42,770 --> 01:15:43,803
What?

1462
01:15:49,842 --> 01:15:51,742
Rachel's back
in the hospital, honey.

1463
01:15:56,214 --> 01:15:58,495
Wait, is she starting
treatment again?

1464
01:16:00,817 --> 01:16:02,684
It's not for treatment, honey.

1465
01:16:07,789 --> 01:16:08,789
Oh.

1466
01:16:12,593 --> 01:16:13,893
Mom, what?

1467
01:16:15,028 --> 01:16:16,595
Well, I thought
we could go and...

1468
01:16:16,597 --> 01:16:19,297
To force me
to hang out with her?

1469
01:16:19,299 --> 01:16:20,798
Greg, come on.

1470
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:21,999
Don't worry, Mom,
I'm sure you can find

1471
01:16:22,001 --> 01:16:24,161
another girl with cancer
after Rachel dies.

1472
01:16:25,536 --> 01:16:27,069
Which, by the way...

1473
01:16:27,737 --> 01:16:29,204
...she's decided to do.

1474
01:16:31,740 --> 01:16:34,241
She's just decided to die...

1475
01:16:34,243 --> 01:16:36,910
...so maybe I can decide
not to visit her.

1476
01:16:42,582 --> 01:16:45,550
I promise you,
you will regret that...

1477
01:16:45,552 --> 01:16:46,632
...if you don't visit her.

1478
01:16:47,954 --> 01:16:49,753
You'll regret it
for the rest of your life.

1479
01:16:49,755 --> 01:16:51,554
Mom, that's probably true.

1480
01:16:51,556 --> 01:16:52,788
But honestly,
I have a shitload of things

1481
01:16:52,790 --> 01:16:54,790
to regret right now.

1482
01:16:54,792 --> 01:16:57,058
I regret not having a date
for tomorrow's stupid prom.

1483
01:16:57,060 --> 01:16:59,794
I regret being too weird
to make friends.

1484
01:16:59,796 --> 01:17:00,961
I definitely regret making

1485
01:17:00,963 --> 01:17:02,629
all those shitty films
with Earl.

1486
01:17:02,631 --> 01:17:04,831
And I assume you saw the email
I got today, from Pitt?

1487
01:17:06,032 --> 01:17:07,732
Oh, no? You didn't see it

1488
01:17:07,734 --> 01:17:08,899
while you're going though
all my shit? Here.

1489
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:11,134
Have a look.

1490
01:17:11,136 --> 01:17:12,635
I'm definitely gonna regret

1491
01:17:12,637 --> 01:17:14,317
doing literally
no school work this year!

1492
01:17:14,604 --> 01:17:15,904
Oh, my God, Greg.

1493
01:17:15,906 --> 01:17:17,939
I know. Admission rescinded,

1494
01:17:17,941 --> 01:17:20,041
due to significant change
in my academic record.

1495
01:17:20,043 --> 01:17:21,909
Oh, well,
no college next year.

1496
01:17:21,911 --> 01:17:23,844
I guess I'll just be home,
which sucks for you...

1497
01:17:23,846 --> 01:17:24,811
...because it's gonna be
so hard for you

1498
01:17:24,813 --> 01:17:26,612
to go through all my stuff.

1499
01:17:26,614 --> 01:17:28,080
Can you just do me a favor
right now, Mom?

1500
01:17:28,082 --> 01:17:29,748
Just leave me alone. Okay?

1501
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:31,349
Just let me sit here
and regret stuff.

1502
01:17:31,351 --> 01:17:32,717
I'm just gonna think about

1503
01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:33,818
all the things
that I've ever done...

1504
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:35,252
...and all the things
I haven't done

1505
01:17:35,254 --> 01:17:37,694
and just regret the living shit out of it.
Okay?

1506
01:17:42,793 --> 01:17:44,960
All the deadlines
have passed, Victor.

1507
01:17:44,962 --> 01:17:46,227
What's he gonna do next year?

1508
01:17:46,229 --> 01:17:47,695
He's just gonna
waste the year?

1509
01:17:47,697 --> 01:17:48,996
He is grieving, honey.

1510
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:50,297
You have to let him grieve.

1511
01:17:50,299 --> 01:17:51,298
But I can't just sit by

1512
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:53,033
and just let him
ruin his life.

1513
01:17:53,035 --> 01:17:56,236
The universe does not operate

1514
01:17:56,238 --> 01:17:57,958
according to a college deadline!

1515
01:18:17,123 --> 01:18:18,223
Can I ask you something?

1516
01:18:19,725 --> 01:18:21,092
Nope.

1517
01:18:21,094 --> 01:18:22,726
No. It's not what you think.

1518
01:18:22,728 --> 01:18:23,960
It's just that
prom is tonight and...

1519
01:18:23,962 --> 01:18:26,095
Let me ask you something.
What is this?

1520
01:18:27,063 --> 01:18:28,963
What is up
with the arm touching?

1521
01:18:28,965 --> 01:18:30,164
Are you just being friendly,

1522
01:18:30,166 --> 01:18:31,632
or is this some
calculated maneuver...

1523
01:18:31,634 --> 01:18:33,033
...to get me to do
whatever you want?

1524
01:18:33,035 --> 01:18:34,267
'Cause you have to understand

1525
01:18:34,269 --> 01:18:36,035
what it does
when a beautiful, sexy...

1526
01:18:36,037 --> 01:18:37,236
...otherwise
thoughtful girl...

1527
01:18:37,238 --> 01:18:39,137
...touches the arm
of a scrawny, pasty

1528
01:18:39,139 --> 01:18:40,304
groundhog-faced kid.

1529
01:18:40,306 --> 01:18:41,405
It's an act of cruelty.

1530
01:18:42,407 --> 01:18:43,907
Are you done?

1531
01:18:43,909 --> 01:18:45,108
Yeah. Yeah, I'm done.

1532
01:18:45,110 --> 01:18:46,843
I'm done with you.

1533
01:18:46,845 --> 01:18:49,045
I'm done
with this stupid film.

1534
01:18:49,047 --> 01:18:50,413
All right? I'm done.

1535
01:18:52,015 --> 01:18:53,715
Yo! But you ain't
done with me!

1536
01:18:53,717 --> 01:18:55,049
I'm back for my revenge

1537
01:18:55,051 --> 01:18:56,316
Stab you in the dick

1538
01:18:56,318 --> 01:18:58,051
Pardon my French

1539
01:18:58,053 --> 01:19:00,386
Really? You're gonna stab me
in the dick? Go ahead.

1540
01:19:00,388 --> 01:19:01,754
Stab me in the dick.

1541
01:19:01,756 --> 01:19:04,423
Just no rapping.
Okay? All right?

1542
01:19:04,425 --> 01:19:05,957
I'll break your eyeball

1543
01:19:05,959 --> 01:19:07,124
with a fist I got clenched

1544
01:19:07,126 --> 01:19:08,925
Shove your body
under another bench

1545
01:19:08,927 --> 01:19:10,726
Stop rapping!

1546
01:19:10,728 --> 01:19:12,728
Knock your teeth out
with the fist I got clenched

1547
01:19:12,730 --> 01:19:14,970
I can't do this if you're
gonna rap the whole time.

1548
01:19:31,844 --> 01:19:32,977
Aw!

1549
01:19:35,814 --> 01:19:36,914
Break it up!

1550
01:19:36,916 --> 01:19:38,248
Earl!

1551
01:19:38,250 --> 01:19:40,850
Break it up! Break it up!

1552
01:19:40,852 --> 01:19:41,851
I thought you were
eating lunch

1553
01:19:41,853 --> 01:19:43,018
in Mr. McCarthy's office.

1554
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:44,252
Man, I was,
but he all sad talking

1555
01:19:44,254 --> 01:19:45,386
about German music and shit.

1556
01:19:45,388 --> 01:19:47,688
That's boring as hell, man.

1557
01:19:47,690 --> 01:19:50,223
I'm surprised and disappointed
to see you two fighting.

1558
01:19:50,225 --> 01:19:51,958
And, Phillip,
I'm surprised and disappointed

1559
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:53,259
to see you
back on school grounds...

1560
01:19:53,261 --> 01:19:54,893
...after being expelled!

1561
01:19:54,895 --> 01:19:56,160
All right, man.

1562
01:19:56,162 --> 01:19:56,994
Please leave the premises.

1563
01:19:56,996 --> 01:19:58,328
Back to class.

1564
01:19:58,330 --> 01:19:59,862
Let's go!

1565
01:19:59,864 --> 01:20:01,997
Maxwell, Ryan, Soledad,

1566
01:20:01,999 --> 01:20:04,265
stop gawking and start walking!

1567
01:20:09,136 --> 01:20:10,903
Greg!

1568
01:20:10,905 --> 01:20:13,238
Yo, babe!
You see me pummel this bitch?

1569
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:14,472
Come on and keep walking

1570
01:20:14,474 --> 01:20:16,174
Before I can whoop
that ass again, man.

1571
01:20:16,176 --> 01:20:17,508
Madison, what?

1572
01:20:18,576 --> 01:20:20,043
Come to prom with me.

1573
01:20:22,479 --> 01:20:24,112
I know the whole
movie situation

1574
01:20:24,114 --> 01:20:25,913
was really difficult for you...

1575
01:20:25,915 --> 01:20:27,995
...and I kind of feel like
it was my fault.

1576
01:20:28,549 --> 01:20:29,949
So I just kind of wanted to

1577
01:20:29,951 --> 01:20:32,271
make it up to you
a little bit.

1578
01:20:33,519 --> 01:20:35,319
Is this a pity date?

1579
01:20:35,321 --> 01:20:36,586
No.

1580
01:20:36,588 --> 01:20:38,120
No, it's not a pity date.

1581
01:20:40,089 --> 01:20:41,289
Greg, just come
to prom with me.

1582
01:20:41,291 --> 01:20:42,531
I think we'd have a good time.

1583
01:20:45,527 --> 01:20:47,427
Told you you would get a date.

1584
01:20:48,295 --> 01:20:49,295
Yep.

1585
01:20:55,134 --> 01:20:57,969
So you're welcome.
For the tux and everything.

1586
01:20:59,237 --> 01:21:00,403
Thanks, Mom.

1587
01:21:15,852 --> 01:21:18,453
I'm very upset
about this college thing.

1588
01:21:20,322 --> 01:21:21,955
But your father and I can wait

1589
01:21:21,957 --> 01:21:24,437
till you're ready
to talk about it.

1590
01:21:25,859 --> 01:21:27,125
I appreciate that.

1591
01:21:30,162 --> 01:21:31,962
Don't forget your corsage.

1592
01:21:35,066 --> 01:21:36,066
All right.

1593
01:21:41,905 --> 01:21:44,239
My handsome boy...

1594
01:21:44,241 --> 01:21:45,873
...going to prom.

1595
01:21:48,610 --> 01:21:50,611
Take lots of pictures, okay?

1596
01:22:09,496 --> 01:22:10,561
302 Halket Street.

1597
01:22:11,095 --> 01:22:12,528
What's that?

1598
01:22:12,530 --> 01:22:14,062
I said 302 Halket Street.

1599
01:22:14,530 --> 01:22:16,163
Huh?

1600
01:22:16,165 --> 01:22:17,564
302 Halket Street.

1601
01:22:17,566 --> 01:22:19,432
Halket? Okay.
Okay.

1602
01:22:19,434 --> 01:22:21,100
You got it, baby.

1603
01:22:21,102 --> 01:22:22,568
So you love this girl?

1604
01:22:24,304 --> 01:22:26,204
Uh, no.
I wouldn't go that far.

1605
01:22:26,471 --> 01:22:27,904
What?

1606
01:22:27,906 --> 01:22:29,939
No. I... No.

1607
01:22:29,941 --> 01:22:31,006
Yeah, so you guys
are gonna be getting busy

1608
01:22:31,008 --> 01:22:32,941
on my brand new Tuscan leather?

1609
01:22:32,943 --> 01:22:34,976
No. I think...
Huh?

1610
01:22:34,978 --> 01:22:36,577
No, we're not.
I don't think so.

1611
01:22:36,579 --> 01:22:38,512
Nah, I'm just
playing with you.

1612
01:22:38,514 --> 01:22:40,514
But I do hope you get some.

1613
01:22:40,516 --> 01:22:42,449
It's really gonna depend
on what she wants to do.

1614
01:22:42,451 --> 01:22:43,450
If you really love her,
though,

1615
01:22:43,452 --> 01:22:45,018
you definitely got a shot.

1616
01:22:45,020 --> 01:22:46,386
Because she'll know.

1617
01:22:47,354 --> 01:22:48,954
She is fine though?

1618
01:22:50,489 --> 01:22:51,489
Huh?

1619
01:23:54,317 --> 01:23:55,417
Hey.

1620
01:23:59,355 --> 01:24:00,621
I know, I look amazing.

1621
01:24:05,559 --> 01:24:07,293
Can I put some flowers on you?

1622
01:24:22,441 --> 01:24:24,041
Like that.

1623
01:24:32,016 --> 01:24:33,176
Okay.

1624
01:24:34,117 --> 01:24:36,785
Before we watch this...

1625
01:24:36,787 --> 01:24:39,087
...I'm sorry
it took so long to make.

1626
01:24:39,089 --> 01:24:41,589
But the reason is...

1627
01:24:41,591 --> 01:24:44,358
...just couldn't figure out
how to get it to not suck.

1628
01:24:45,727 --> 01:24:48,795
But... we never really
did figure it out.

1629
01:24:48,797 --> 01:24:50,229
It still sucks.

1630
01:24:55,067 --> 01:24:57,101
It's not exactly
what I wanted to say to you.

1631
01:25:03,707 --> 01:25:04,707
But...

1632
01:25:06,209 --> 01:25:08,076
...whatever.

1633
01:25:08,078 --> 01:25:10,038
Let's just
watch this first, okay?

1634
01:28:23,502 --> 01:28:24,969
Hey, should I get a nurse?

1635
01:28:26,972 --> 01:28:28,973
Denise! Denise!

1636
01:29:41,479 --> 01:29:43,480
<i>That was the last time
I saw Rachel.</i>

1637
01:29:44,782 --> 01:29:47,016
<i>She went into a coma
shortly after that,</i>

1638
01:29:47,018 --> 01:29:48,484
<i>and died about 10 hours later.</i>

1639
01:29:51,754 --> 01:29:53,714
<i>I know I told you
she doesn't die.</i>

1640
01:29:54,389 --> 01:29:55,655
<i>And I'm sorry.</i>

1641
01:29:56,390 --> 01:29:58,090
<i>Deep down...</i>

1642
01:29:58,092 --> 01:30:00,659
<i>...somehow,
I didn't think she would.</i>

1643
01:30:02,428 --> 01:30:03,694
<i>But she did.</i>

1644
01:33:30,263 --> 01:33:32,197
<i>Dear Greg,
I heard what happened</i>

1645
01:33:32,199 --> 01:33:33,665
<i>with your class work.</i>

1646
01:33:33,667 --> 01:33:34,999
<i>And with Pitt State.</i>

1647
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:37,867
<i>So, I wrote them a letter,</i>

1648
01:33:37,869 --> 01:33:39,949
<i>trying to convince them
to let you back in.</i>

1649
01:33:40,803 --> 01:33:43,938
<i>There's a copy in here,
if you want to read it.</i>

1650
01:33:43,940 --> 01:33:45,739
<i>Hopefully, it works,
because that would mean...</i>

1651
01:33:45,741 --> 01:33:48,675
<i>...I have powers
from beyond the grave.</i>

1652
01:33:48,677 --> 01:33:50,958
<i>But you should probably
send them something too.</i>

1653
01:33:52,579 --> 01:33:55,881
<i>Goodbye, Greg.
You're a good friend.</i>

1654
01:33:55,883 --> 01:33:56,982
<i>Although if you don't
go to college,</i>

1655
01:33:56,984 --> 01:33:58,616
<i>you're also an idiot.</i>

1656
01:33:58,618 --> 01:34:00,150
<i>But you already knew that.</i>

1657
01:34:01,152 --> 01:34:02,285
<i>Love, Rachel.</i>

1658
01:34:04,788 --> 01:34:08,157
<i>I'd also like for you
to take some of my pillows.</i>

1659
01:34:08,159 --> 01:34:10,859
<i>They'll want a good home
where they'll be loved.</i>

1660
01:34:10,861 --> 01:34:12,827
<i>Not in the way you're thinking,</i>

1661
01:34:12,829 --> 01:34:13,869
<i>that's disgusting.</i>

1662
01:37:49,107 --> 01:37:51,341
<i>Dear Pittsburgh
State Admissions:</i>

1663
01:37:51,343 --> 01:37:53,042
<i>I'm writing
on behalf of someone</i>

1664
01:37:53,044 --> 01:37:54,810
<i>who gave me
half a year of his life...</i>

1665
01:37:54,812 --> 01:37:56,077
<i>...at the time when I was at</i>

1666
01:37:56,079 --> 01:37:58,312
<i>my most difficult to be around.</i>

1667
01:37:58,314 --> 01:38:00,447
<i>He has a very
low opinion of himself,</i>

1668
01:38:00,449 --> 01:38:01,514
<i>which is why
I think it's necessary...</i>

1669
01:38:01,516 --> 01:38:02,982
<i>...that you hear from someone</i>

1670
01:38:02,984 --> 01:38:05,084
<i>who sees him
as he actually is:</i>

1671
01:38:05,086 --> 01:38:07,352
<i>A limitlessly kind,
sweet, giving,</i>

1672
01:38:07,354 --> 01:38:09,387
<i>and genuine person.</i>

1673
01:38:09,389 --> 01:38:11,429
<i>No matter how much
he would deny it.</i>

1674
01:38:12,256 --> 01:38:14,490
<i>The drop in his academic
performance this year...</i>

1675
01:38:14,492 --> 01:38:15,491
<i>...is the consequence
of all the time</i>

1676
01:38:15,493 --> 01:38:19,394
<i>...and the time he spent
making things for me...</i>

1677
01:38:19,396 --> 01:38:21,529
<i>...and how hard
that was for him.</i>

1678
01:38:21,531 --> 01:38:23,497
<i>You can ask him about it...</i>

1679
01:38:23,499 --> 01:38:25,532
<i>...but his sort of
over-the-top humility</i>

1680
01:38:25,534 --> 01:38:27,100
<i>will probably get in the way.</i>

1681
01:38:27,102 --> 01:38:31,437
<i>No one has done more
to make me smile than he has.</i>

1682
01:38:31,439 --> 01:38:33,005
<i>And no one ever could.</i>

1683
01:38:51,190 --> 01:38:52,423
<i>Rachel's ashes were scattered</i>

1684
01:38:52,425 --> 01:38:54,191
<i>in a park behind her house.</i>

1685
01:38:55,327 --> 01:38:57,061
<i>Apparently, she ran away
from home once</i>

1686
01:38:57,063 --> 01:38:58,495
<i>and tried to live there.</i>

1687
01:39:00,364 --> 01:39:03,332
<i>It was this story
her aunt told at the funeral.</i>

1688
01:39:03,334 --> 01:39:05,267
<i>She was trying
to become a squirrel.</i>

1689
01:39:06,369 --> 01:39:07,535
<i>She thought she could
turn into one</i>

1690
01:39:07,537 --> 01:39:09,136
<i>just by being in the forest...</i>

1691
01:39:09,138 --> 01:39:12,272
<i>...and wanting it really bad.</i>

1692
01:39:12,274 --> 01:39:15,375
<i>I guess maybe that's
what Mr. McCarthy meant...</i>

1693
01:39:15,377 --> 01:39:17,977
<i>...about someone's life
continuing to unfold.</i>

1694
01:39:19,412 --> 01:39:21,012
<i>It was weird to be
learning something new</i>

1695
01:39:21,014 --> 01:39:22,546
<i>about Rachel after she died.</i>

1696
01:39:24,148 --> 01:39:26,415
<i>But somehow,
it was reassuring as well.</i>
