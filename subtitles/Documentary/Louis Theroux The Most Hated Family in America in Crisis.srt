00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,580
What about me?

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,020
You think you never hurt me?

4
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,700
You've hurt me too, you know.

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,800
How did I ever hurt you?

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,770
Tell me. What was it?

7
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,140
That.

8
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,540
I would never forget that.

9
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:28,870
Never.

10
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,290
That? That's...

11
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:35,900
How was that my fault?

12
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,590
If it weren't for you...

13
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:42,720
Forget it.

14
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:44,850
Tell me!

15
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:47,080
If it weren't for me, what?

16
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,670
How was that my fault?

17
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,000
- But you!
- I said stop!

18
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:57,470
You better take that one to the grave.

19
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,890
The edited article is out?

20
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,990
Yes, have a look.
It came out nice.

[Profession Women Dislike
"Heavy Equipment Operator, a 3D job"]

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But this is different from what I wrote!

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,350
How? That's exactly what you got for us.

24
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,450
The concept's completely different.
And the subtitles are different, too.

25
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,200
How could you...

26
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,250
I wanted to raise the alarm to the society that only looks at the education level

27
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,430
and talk about how blue collar works can make a great living using their skills,

28
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,510
without having to worry about retiring.

29
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:06,130
So how could you ruin it this way?

30
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:10,800
Do you know how proud and respectful he is about his job?

31
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,570
How could you blur his pictures?

32
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,410
Imagine how he'd feel if he read this?

33
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,410
That's his problem.

34
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,750
You have to think about the readers.

35
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,110
Even if that's the reality,

36
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,620
our magazine could change their views.

37
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,500
Isn't that what journalists are for?

38
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,140
It wasn't my decision!

39
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,520
It was decided at the editors meeting!

40
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,790
You wrote several articles for me before.

41
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,580
What happened?
Why were you so off?

42
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,740
I was off?

43
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,850
Ask any woman who's getting married.

44
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,410
Ask if they like heavy equipment operators!

45
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,450
They don't know and I was trying to let people know about it!

46
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,730
Do you want to ruin my magazine?

47
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,860
You be the editor then.

48
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,440
Then take this article out.

49
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,510
It's already at the printers.

50
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,580
You can't take this out?

51
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,630
It's too late.

52
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,150
I wired $50 just now.

53
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,500
Don't skip your meal, okay?

54
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,970
Yes, honey. I love you.

55
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,370
You!

56
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,310
I'm going to kick your butt!

57
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,170
Honey, I'll call you later.

58
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,250
Are you crazy?

59
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,710
You're the one who's crazy.

60
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,420
I'm off?

61
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:51,000
And here you are, supporting a college graduate who's not interested in getting a job for 5 years?

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You think he'll make it big someday?

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,540
Yeah, right!

64
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,430
He's in his thirties, getting allowance from his woman!

65
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,200
Even if he does make it, he'll dump you.

66
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,780
Why? You think I'm wrong?

67
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,490
Oh, man.

68
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:05,870
I don't believe this.

69
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,780
Compared to your loser boyfriend,

70
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,890
he's a thousand times better, can't you see?

71
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:14,700
Why would you belittle a hard worker like him?

72
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,270
You don't know anything about men.

73
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,330
And that's why you're dating that loser!

74
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:20,230
Why? You think I'm wrong?

75
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,460
You don't want to work, do you?

76
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,040
No! I don't want to work!

77
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,920
Not with you, no!

78
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,900
And don't forget to wire me the payment.

79
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,270
Hey!

80
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,500
Hobak.

81
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,900
That was quick.
Where are you coming from?

82
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,130
The magazine editor's office.

83
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,540
I should learn to control my temper.

84
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,290
I got fired from my part time job.

85
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:19,630
Oh, that editor is mean and horrible.

86
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,260
It's people like her who are driving this country into ruins.

87
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,250
I'm too upset to worry about the country.

88
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,900
I must be adopted.

89
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,070
Now what's wrong?

90
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,200
I had a fight with Subak.

91
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,400
Both mom and Subak...

92
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,800
Whenever something happens, they blame me.

93
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,380
I thought that since I was little.

94
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,260
Maybe my real mom is out there somewhere.

95
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,620
How...

96
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,680
I even had dreams.

97
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,480
Dreams where I was waiting by the front door,

98
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,360
in case my real mom came for me.

99
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,240
People don't remember when they hurt others,

100
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,070
and they only dwell on their pain.

101
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,310
I guess you can't help it.

102
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,780
Hobak.

103
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:26,380
Anyway, I'm going to pay for mom's party.

104
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,060
You?

105
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,590
We'll have lunch at a Chinese restaurant and send them to Jeju-do island.

106
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,710
I'll pitch in for half.

107
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:38,110
You pay for lunch, and I'll pay for the trip.

108
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,760
How does that sound?

109
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,190
But you're not working.

110
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:44,270
I was a teacher for 7 years. 
I can afford it.

111
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,200
Okay, then.

112
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:51,040
But mom might get mad if I tell her,

113
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,710
so can you talk to her?

114
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:56,110
Okay. Let's be good daughters to her like this.

115
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,300
Give this to him and get some bone soup.

116
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,810
And don't forget baby formula.

117
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,560
Okay. I'll be back.

118
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:13,730
You're successful because you're so kind to your employees.

119
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:16,330
Everyone else is in trouble, but not us.

120
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:19,340
I'm really lucky, thanks to you.

121
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,620
It's thanks to Sangnam.

122
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,070
Without him, you and I would be lost.

123
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,130
You're right. I have to go too.

124
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:29,610
I have to go grocery shopping.

125
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:35,760
Thank you, Mr. Choi, for coming to see us in person like this.

126
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,460
And thank you for the baby formula.

127
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,390
Thank you, Mr. Choi.

128
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,130
Don't worry and get well soon.

129
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,500
Without you, it's boring at the site.

130
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,390
Huh?

131
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,610
- Hello.
- What are you doing here?

132
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,750
I'm going home and this is a shortcut.

133
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,460
Is this where you live?

134
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,120
Uh, yes...

135
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,590
Oh, isn't the magazine out?
You said today.

136
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,080
No, I had to brush something up.

137
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,150
Are you brushing up my face?

138
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,860
Why would I need to do that?

139
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,890
Your face is perfect.

140
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:19,230
I should've called you. I'm sorry.

141
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,850
There's no need to be sorry.

142
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,200
What's going on?

143
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,140
No, nothing's going on.

144
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,440
What could be going on with me?

145
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,160
That's odd.

146
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,410
Something feels very different.

147
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,240
What happened?

148
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,430
Oh!

149
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:38,290
Your blind date didn't go well, right?

150
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:40,740
Daebak told me things often don't work out.

151
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,340
That's not true!

152
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,480
It's a special issue, so it's late.

153
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,360
Wow!

154
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,070
I'm getting excited here.

155
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,600
This is my first magazine debut,

156
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,270
so please make sure I look good.

157
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:54,720
And don't forget to give me the list of all the women who ask for my number.

158
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,080
Don't leave any of them out.

159
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,250
I won't.

160
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,230
Goodbye.

161
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,150
Your family's obviously very important.

162
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:27,590
You never missed work, even when I was sick.

163
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,490
When Sintong got surgery you still worked,

164
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:32,660
saying you had to make money.

165
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,420
Then you should grow up.

166
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,750
And pick up Bangtong from preschool.

167
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,070
They are cleaning up there.

168
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:42,080
Okay, ma'am.

169
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,260
Pretend you didn't see it.

170
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,480
Hand that over.

171
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,810
Please!

172
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,560
Do you want me to hit you now or later?

173
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:19,010
Where are you going?
Hand that over!

174
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,700
You're so mean!

175
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,580
How can I survive on $3 a day?

176
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,150
Then get a job.

177
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,650
I'm going to get a credit card, then!

178
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,880
If you do, I'll kill you and kill myself.

179
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,960
I had to pay for your credit card debt off just last year.
Don't you remember?

180
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,460
So grow up before I get real violent.

181
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,800
Understand?

182
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:48,800
Man!

183
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,410
I'm going nuts.

184
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,310
It's me, Anggeum.

185
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:58,530
My birthday party at the hotel buffet,

186
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,310
I canceled it.

187
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:03,700
People don't celebrate their 60th birthday so extravagantly.

188
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,530
People look down on it for making it such a big deal of it.

189
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,910
People live to be 100.

190
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,990
Turning 60 isn't a big deal nowadays.
So I'm canceling it.

191
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:23,120
Oh, this is crazy, just crazy.

192
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:24,940
How sad?

193
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,640
What did I do to deserve this?

194
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,760
It's me, Anggeum.

195
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,530
I canceled my birthday party at the hotel.

196
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,660
People don't celebrate their 60th birthday so extravagantly.

197
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:51,860
People look down on it for making it such a big deal of it.

198
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,740
People live to be 100.
Turning 60 isn't a big deal nowadays.

199
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,940
What's wrong with Anggeum?

200
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,240
Has she gone mad?

201
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,590
She hasn't, but she's almost there.

202
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,940
So don't bother her.

203
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,860
What if she turns completely mad?

204
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,150
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

205
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:12,590
Gwangbak, can you go to the supermarket?

206
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:13,610
Okay.

207
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,020
What?

208
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,380
Remember me?
Deduct it from my doctor's bill!

209
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,740
- Can I try this?
- Go ahead.

210
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:08,350
Oh, it's yummy. It's yummy.

211
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,190
She says she'll buy some.

212
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,140
Oh, man...

213
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,440
Oh, yes, yes.

214
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,470
Oh, if you cry, you don't look pretty.

215
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,070
Peekaboo!

216
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,860
I made some noodles.

217
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,210
Get up and have some.

218
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,840
I don't feel like it.

219
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,820
Nobody eats because they feel like it.

220
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,750
You like noodles, mom.

221
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,110
Try some.

222
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,880
Just leave it there and get out.

223
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:44,200
Wait.

224
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,390
Let's go.

225
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,240
Mom!

226
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,440
Subak, I'm here.

227
00:13:56,590 --> 00:14:01,780
Mom, get up. Mom, eat something.

228
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:04,400
- Mom.
- Subak, come out.

229
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,630
I made your favorite, tofu stew.

230
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,460
I made it with handmade tofu.

231
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:13,280
If I bring it here, you might throw it again, so I set up the table in the dining room.

232
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,690
Should I bring it here?

233
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,280
Look who I brought.

234
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,370
Look at Jungji.

235
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:27,230
Mommy... Mommy...

236
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,200
I don't want to be bothered.

237
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,420
Get out and take them with you.

238
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,600
Aeji, let's go.

239
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,510
The food's ready, so eat.

240
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:42,200
Gwangbak and I will take care of mom's party.

241
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,180
So don't worry too much.

242
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,480
I'm sure you won't starve.

243
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,700
Starve? Starve?

244
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,580
You think I'm afraid of starving?

245
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,580
For you, food may be everything.

246
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,320
So what would you know?

247
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,510
As long as you have food, you think you're set!

248
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,080
But I'm not like you, okay?

249
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,850
How can you eat at a time like this?

250
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,060
How can you be so indifferent?

251
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,900
I heard you made your sister angry yesterday.

252
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,050
How can you only think of yourself?

253
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,950
Delicious!

254
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:14,300
She called everyone one by one,

255
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,170
saying she canceled her party.

256
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:18,030
She was all laughing about it.

257
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,800
I'm going to tell everyone the truth!

258
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,000
Serves her right for bragging about Minjung.

259
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,050
I thought only daughter in laws have issues,

260
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,880
but I guess son in laws have them too.

261
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,430
That's what happens when the parents don't know better!

262
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:34,290
That darn woman!
I'm loving this.

263
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:39,540
She was going to show off, using Subak and her husband, but she failed.

264
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:43,090
Oh, when I think about that, oh!

265
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:46,280
The heartaches I've suffered could fill a dozen 5 ton trucks.

266
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,190
Get back at them by becoming successful.

267
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,910
Don't worry, mom.

268
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,060
My life isn't going to end like this.

269
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,640
Not one plan but you sure are ultra positive.

270
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,050
I envy you, Sedal.

271
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:01,590
Guys! Let your dad eat, please!

272
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:04,120
Eating with them is impossible.

273
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,290
Why didn't you get me my own bowl?

274
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:08,620
Just eat, will you?
So annoying...

275
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:14,200
Hey, don't cross this line, okay?

276
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,470
Dad, I hate you!

277
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:18,180
Don't get mad.
This isn't the first time.

278
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,950
You!

279
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,460
Mom, come with Yeongdal.
Come and eat.

280
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,720
Why would I expose myself to stress?

281
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,620
Stress?
But I'm paying for it.

282
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:30,310
Actually, you're not really paying.

283
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:33,290
Fine. My wife's paying for it. So what?

284
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:36,970
I'm going to hold my head up this time.

285
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,740
- Me too!
- Me too!

286
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,790
Go!

287
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,390
Go!

288
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,950
Hey, go!

289
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:10,010
What is it?

290
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:12,300
We're holding mom's memorial service today.

291
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,850
Why didn't you come yesterday?

292
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:18,090
I don't believe you sent these.

293
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,090
What did I send?

294
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:22,380
Oh, we'll talk when you get here.

295
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,460
Hello?

296
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,260
Parcel service!

297
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,620
Is anyone home?
Parcel service!

298
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,860
Hey! You woke up my baby!

299
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,540
You know how hard it was to make him sleep?

300
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,270
I don't believe you!

301
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,070
Attention, at ease.

302
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:37,670
Attention, at ease.

303
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,260
You have to be quiet today.

304
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,180
- I'm starving here.
- Attention.

305
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,700
At ease.

306
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:46,060
Attention.

307
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,060
At ease.

308
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,390
Hey!

309
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,750
Minjung.

310
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,950
Uh, it's been a while.

311
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:07,650
So the rumors were true.

312
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,650
I couldn't believe it.

313
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:14,860
Well, I'll see you later. I'm busy.

314
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,040
Hey, hey!

315
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:19,350
Cheer up and don't miss the class reunion.

316
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,350
Don't feel embarrassed.

317
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:38,060
Where are you?
Everyone's waiting for you.

318
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,480
Okay. I'll be right over.

319
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:43,960
Parcel service.

320
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,970
Where are you?
Where's my rice?

321
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:49,210
I was just there, but you weren't home.

322
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:51,400
I was waiting but I had to go to the market.

323
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,020
Please bring the rice right away.

324
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,380
I can't right now.
Can I come tomorrow?

325
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,970
But we have to eat!
You want us to starve?

326
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:03,510
But I have to make the next delivery...

327
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,510
Hello?

328
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:22,140
Everyone's hungry, so should we start?

329
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,570
It's your birthday.
What should we do?

330
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:25,880
Order the food.

331
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,350
Why? Minjung's not here.

332
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:31,740
He shouldn't make others wait for him.

333
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,370
He's so inconsiderate.

334
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:36,050
You're the one who's inconsiderate.

335
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:38,620
You used to call him "My Minjung," remember?

336
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:41,090
He should've stayed a successful businessman.

337
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,680
Things happen.

338
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,580
He didn't do it on purpose.

339
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:48,830
He's busy because he has to make deliveries.

340
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,330
That darn parcel service!

341
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,140
I used to like getting packages in the mail, but not any more.

342
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,880
When will you grow up?

343
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:59,120
I'm sorry.

344
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:09,950
I'm sorry I'm late.

345
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,580
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo.

346
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:19,960
Minjung, we were all waiting for you.

347
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,260
Now that you're here, let's start.

348
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,700
Let's order. I'm starving.

349
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,250
We'll order first and cut the cake.

350
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:35,030
Are you proud of that?

351
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:37,690
What?

352
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:40,180
Why didn't you change?

353
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,850
You should be embarrassed.

354
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,830
Oh, you wreak of sweat!

355
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:52,760
I'm sorry. I was in a hurry.

356
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,600
It's okay.

357
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,170
Where are they?

358
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:59,530
Hey, the menu.

359
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:04,400
Bring it over here.

360
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,990
Can't you tell who's paying for it?

361
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,760
Why are you acting like a child?

362
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,770
I'm an expert on acting like a child.

363
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,730
Father, mother, what would you like?

364
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:20,120
I think this side and this side looks good.

365
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,320
They must be cheap.

366
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,450
How did you know?

367
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:27,490
Just kidding.
Pick anything you want.

368
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:29,520
What do we know?

369
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:33,730
Minjung, you pick.

370
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:34,900
Like how you used to.

371
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,940
You always know what's good.

372
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,130
But I'm not a regular here...

373
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,390
Sedal, order something they'd like.

374
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:09,780
Today is my old friend's sister in law and my only mother in law,

375
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:13,670
the woman with lots of emotional baggage,

376
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:17,030
Ms. Lee Anggeum's 60th birthday.

377
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:19,410
Happy birthday! Applause!

378
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:21,090
It's mom's first memorial service.

379
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:22,710
Is your mother in law's birthday so important?

380
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:24,980
Why aren't you applauding?

381
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:35,920
We'll cut the cake now.

382
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,930
Loser, take some pictures.

383
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:44,610
Okay, get ready to cut the cake.

384
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,410
Take the knife.

385
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,210
Please cut the cake.

386
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:52,310
Okay.

387
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,460
Applause!

388
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,660
She's the best cake cutter I know!

389
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:05,410
Next is a special performance by the 4 daughters in tacky matching dresses

390
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:08,380
the sames ones they wore at their father's birthday.

391
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:13,720
Subak, Hobak, Gwangbak, and Haebak will sing a song in Anggeum's honor.

392
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,030
Applause!

393
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:22,470
Start the song!

394
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:30,480
Forgetting the pain from giving us life

395
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:37,030
You've spent nights and days raising us

396
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:43,510
Washing us clean

397
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:50,370
Working your hands and feet to the bone

398
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:55,540
You've given us so much! Beneath the sky...

399
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,180
I'll come after lunch.

400
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,560
How can you help out if you leave then?

401
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,240
How can you do this on a day like this?

402
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:04,910
Wait. I'm coming.

403
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:06,220
Delicious, delicious.

404
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:10,070
You worked so hard taking pictures. Eat.

405
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,950
Mom, enjoy.

406
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,560
What's wrong with you?

407
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,140
Excuse me?

408
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:26,980
You're here, so why can't you smile and say happy birthday?

409
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:32,550
Instead, you've been sitting there with a scowl on your face since you've arrived.

410
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,550
Why did you come?

411
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,380
Go deliver your parcels!

412
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,610
- Minjung.
- Minjung.

413
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,130
Sit down.

414
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,460
Ugh.

415
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:23,080
Today's your mother's memorial service, right?

416
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,360
You should go.

417
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:28,550
Things were crazy, so I had forgotten.

418
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:31,170
I realized it when I checked the calendar.

419
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:33,090
You didn't have to come.

420
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:35,560
But it's mother's birthday.

421
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,900
It's okay.

422
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,410
Nobody will get mad at you.

423
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:42,930
And don't take to heart what she does.

424
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,930
She's just upset and in shock.

425
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:48,210
She used to cherish you.

426
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,910
Take Subak and go.

427
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,870
Subak, come.

428
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:00,870
I'll go later.

429
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:03,320
Where are your manners?

430
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,060
Come out right now!

431
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,130
Is this how I raised you?

432
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:09,200
You're someone's daughter in law!

433
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,150
You have duties to uphold!

434
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:13,200
How dare you come here and enjoy yourself like that?

435
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,690
It's your mother in law's first memorial service!

436
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:17,690
Go and fulfill your duties.

437
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:22,160
Why would you make her cry?

438
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,780
Be quiet!

439
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,680
Come out right now!

440
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,400
Oh, boy!

441
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:35,330
The Korean War was nothing compared to this.

442
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,400
Egh, hyo, hyo, hyo.

443
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,370
What's your dream?

444
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:23,800
There he goes again.

445
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:28,540
I want to grow up and marry you and live happily ever after.

446
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:31,350
Yours is also an impossible dream.

447
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,800
Have some corn.

448
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:39,410
That lunch was awful.
I'm starving.

449
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,600
Have some.

450
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,370
- You too, mom.
- Okay.

451
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:45,570
- Thank you.
- Sure.

452
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,500
- Grandmother.
- Yes?

453
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,420
What should I become when I grow up?

454
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:53,230
Why? Are you worried about your future?

455
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:53,970
Yes.

456
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:57,060
Don't worry.
All you need is 3 meals in a day.

457
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,740
Life isn't that special.

458
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:02,240
Eat well, pee and poo well, and sleep well.

459
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,970
It's bad to be greedy.

460
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:06,960
Watch the news.

461
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,380
All these powerful people are getting arrested.

462
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:11,480
That's all because of greed.

463
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:15,030
They're already powerful, but want more.

464
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:18,720
Hey, it's your birthday.
Go lie down.

465
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,070
Then who would fold the laundry?

466
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:25,100
Mother, let me help.

467
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,530
Go have corn.

468
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:28,690
Daebak, don't worry.

469
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:31,630
You could sell spicy rice cakes and still live well enough.

470
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:32,450
That'd be great.

471
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:34,450
I could eat spicy rice cakes everyday!

472
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:37,190
Daebak, you can't make money selling that.

473
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:40,240
So how can you think about eating it?

474
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,130
You must save money for our children's sake.

475
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:51,260
How can you tell him to sell spicy rice cakes?

476
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,280
Why not?

477
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,070
I don't know about that...

478
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:56,990
If life is good as long as you don't go hungry.

479
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:59,430
My family wasn't poor.

480
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:03,260
Does your family have gold cow or something?

481
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,920
Everyone had that in the old days.

482
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,440
My family had a pair, a male and a female.

483
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,440
Why don't you say they had a calf, too?

484
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,480
They did, twins.

485
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,450
Gold cows are nothing.

486
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:21,490
My servants ate with gold and silver spoons.

487
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:26,310
After eating, they'd try to steal them,
but we didn't even pay attention.

488
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:30,460
There were gold and silver spoons everywhere.

489
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:35,050
We had gold buttons on all our clothes.

490
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:39,520
They were so heavy that I envied poor kids.

491
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:43,070
We even played with jacks made of gold.

492
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:51,260
We played with gold pieces this big,
so my wrists hurt when the weather's bad.

493
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:55,450
Same here.
My toes hurt in bad weather.

494
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:57,300
Why is that?

495
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,740
Did you kick around gold nuggets?

496
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,740
You're so quick.

497
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:07,100
There was gold everywhere, so I kicked them,
and that gave me calluses.

498
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,870
I had to kick them here, kick them there.

499
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:12,000
I couldn't walk because of the gold nuggets.

500
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,920
Is it going to rain again? Ouch...

501
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,300
Mom, isn't this your nap time?

502
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,380
You go take a nap, if you want!

503
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:22,650
Hey, have you ever wiped your butt with silk after pooing?

504
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:24,260
Excuse me?

505
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,340
If you haven't, don't talk to me.

506
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:29,250
Others were wiping their bottoms with grass,

507
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:34,420
and my family was the only ones who hung silk in the bathroom to use as toilet paper.

508
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:38,550
Oh, that was what you did?

509
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:41,520
My family used money for that.

510
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,230
What?

511
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:50,710
We used Chinese silk at first, but when we ran out, we hung money to use instead.

512
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:53,840
Brand new bills were too slippery,

513
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:59,380
so my father wrinkled them to make them soft and hung a bunch of them.

514
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:06,160
There was so much dirty money in the bathroom that our neighbors would come at night, 

515
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,930
take them and washed them to use.

516
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:11,680
How come you married my son empty handed?

517
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:16,220
Why didn't you bring some of that money?

518
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:20,590
Why didn't you bring any of that gold with you when you fled during the Korean War?

519
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:24,240
I said it was too heavy to carry!

520
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,750
Hey, stop lying and go make dinner.

521
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:29,470
It's your birthday, so I'm letting you off.

522
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:32,550
Miho, learn this and use it on her later.

523
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:35,010
I want her to go crazy.

524
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,880
How dare you laugh?

525
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,630
What's that?

526
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:47,550
You know that bakery on the corner?

527
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,300
That ugly girl goes there often.

528
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,300
When you see her, teach her a lesson.

529
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,850
Oh, man...

530
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,600
Yes, Daese?

531
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,500
Thank you.

532
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,550
Thank you, Daese.

533
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:40,440
For me, a month goes by so slowly.

534
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,510
For me, it flies by.

535
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:44,240
I turn around and it's pay day.

536
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,030
How is Sangnam doing these days?

537
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:49,590
Is he doing okay?

538
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:54,230
I don't think he's over his first love.

539
00:35:54,230 --> 00:36:00,290
I was cleaning his room today,
and he still has things she sent him.

540
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:03,960
That's why he can't get into a serious relationship again.

541
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,730
They don't even last a month...

542
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:10,640
I hope he finds someone special soon.

543
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,630
I know.

544
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,990
What's going on with that girl on the phone?

545
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:17,910
It won't last longer than a month.

546
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:20,330
Whoever it is, I feel bad for her.

547
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,950
It's all her fault.

548
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:24,950
When I think about her...

549
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:27,510
I'm sorry, Daese.

550
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:30,520
But you're a victim, too.

551
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,200
But she's my sister.

552
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,050
I'll go prepare dinner.

553
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:46,860
Smile.

554
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:49,310
And don't say anything to my family.

555
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,390
Father, I'm here!

556
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:00,220
Minjung's here!

557
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,370
It's so nice to see everyone.

558
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:04,890
Minnam, how's your business going?

559
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:07,900
It's going okay. How about you?

560
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,430
Me too.

561
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,200
Minhye, you're having a second baby?

562
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,150
Congratulations.

563
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:16,960
Let's have a drink.

564
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,440
Mother must be happy to see us all.

565
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,210
Father let me pour you a glass.

566
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:26,000
Yes. Good job, everyone.

567
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,790
Let's eat.

568
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:29,420
Subak, eat.

569
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,890
Okay.

570
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:33,870
I have something to say.

571
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:38,860
Look. Do you think mom would eat these?

572
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:41,160
How could you send these?

573
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,230
I ordered them off the internet.

574
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:45,230
I heard that's what everyone does.

575
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:50,170
This is what everyone does?

576
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:54,430
But this was her first memorial service!

577
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:59,480
You sent these for us to set the table with and show up this late?

578
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,560
Subak, how could you do this?

579
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,700
You know I can't cook.

580
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:09,180
I thought ordering off the internet was better than trying something I can't do.

581
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:13,990
Everyone said it was nice,
but I can see it's not all that.

582
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,200
Minjung, this is all your fault.

583
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,830
You should've paid more attention.

584
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:23,020
Is her mother's birthday more important?

585
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:25,180
Why wouldn't my mom's birthday be important?

586
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,120
It's her 60th birthday!

587
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,460
To be frank, don't you think the living are...

588
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,680
Be quiet.

589
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:37,350
Making you prepare for mother's first memorial service was my fault.

590
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:38,930
I'm sorry.

591
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:43,190
Dad, I'm sorry.

592
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:48,180
Don't worry about it. I'll prepare the dishes.

593
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:52,420
Your mother was sick so I know my way around the kitchen.

594
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,900
If you feel bad don't act like this,

595
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,140
and if you feel sorry don't do these kinds of things.

596
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:03,070
Also, I'm saying this on behalf of everyone here,

597
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:05,780
Minjung, take father to live with you.

598
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,130
That's enough.

599
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:09,650
Father let me speak.

600
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:12,190
I don't want to ask you again.
Take father with you.

601
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,740
I'll have his luggage sent over.

602
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:16,250
You can't suddenly dump him on us.

603
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:17,590
Dump him?

604
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:20,520
Don't you get it?
Minjung's priority is being the first born son.

605
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,890
You should be doing what's expected as the eldest daughter in law.

606
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:26,450
Out of all four children, Minjung has benefited the most,

607
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:29,470
and you're also enjoying those benefits.

608
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:31,560
Did these benefits include parcel delivery?

609
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,710
Shut it.

610
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,720
We'll take him in.

611
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,270
How will you take care of it?

612
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:39,240
We can't take him now.

613
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:44,620
You live in that huge apartment and drive expensive cars, but you can't?

614
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:50,370
You said your old place was too small, so my father sold his land and gave you money!

615
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:53,380
And you kicked him out in less than a month!

616
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,340
I didn't kick him out.

617
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,720
He said he couldn't get used to Seoul and left.

618
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,400
He had no choice but to say that.

619
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,690
Subak, just think about it.

620
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:05,290
From the time you got married until now,

621
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:08,600
have you ever prepared a meal for my parents at all?

622
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,000
Whenever we visit Seoul you had a housekeeper do everything.

623
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,900
What did you ever done for them?

624
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,630
You come during the holidays but you don't help out at all.

625
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:17,790
You just treat yourself like a guest.

626
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:21,160
All the money you spent is earned by Minjung.

627
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:27,210
Let's not talk about this anymore.
Just respect my brother and let him fulfill his duty.

628
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:30,820
Minjung, keep your promise.

629
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:33,310
You said you'll take care of him if mother passes away.

630
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:37,440
Don't yell at Minjung.
I can't take him.

631
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,960
Let's do this later.

632
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,560
Later when?

633
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:47,390
Don't you feel bad for father?

634
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:51,800
With mom gone...
Imagine how lonely he must be in this house.

635
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:55,520
He's even thinking about getting a dog!

636
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:59,260
If I were doing well, I wouldn't ask you.

637
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,950
I'd take him.

638
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:03,040
I won't let you.
I will take him.

639
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,950
So take him then!

640
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:09,870
But we can't afford to take him in right now.
Please understand.

641
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:12,620
This is too much.

642
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,420
Your flashy apartment,

643
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:17,440
whenever we go there, our jaws drop.

644
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,800
Who made that possible?

645
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:23,280
You stole Minjung from our family...

646
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,600
If I were you, I'd volunteer to take him.

647
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,160
Don't you feel the least bit sorry for him?

648
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,160
Stop it.

649
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,830
It's been so long since we're all together and you're arguing?

650
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,920
Do you think your mother would be happy to see this?

651
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,540
You don't have to take care of me. Go home.

652
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,490
Don't get mad at me.

653
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,860
I...

654
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,610
I wasn't going to say this, but...

655
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:48,410
- Stop it.
- They should know.

656
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:51,070
- I said don't.
- Minjung went bankrupt.

657
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:54,520
His company went bankrupt.

658
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:58,010
He completely lost the company so how can we take father in?

659
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:27,980
There's nothing else to do so you should go home.
It's getting late.

660
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,850
Minjung.

661
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:46,310
Minjung!

662
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:49,380
Minjung!

663
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:52,990
Minjung!

664
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:58,870
Minjung.

665
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:05,990
Father.

666
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:14,180
You must be dying inside.

667
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:16,490
You couldn't tell anyone.

668
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:20,190
I know how you feel.

669
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:36,370
Mother.

670
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:40,930
Oh...

671
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:43,330
Mother, you're still up?

672
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:44,860
You're home?

673
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:47,590
Are you ill?

674
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:49,120
Oh...

675
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:53,720
If I die, bury me next to your father.

676
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:56,540
You still have years more.

677
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:59,500
I already told father I'm keeping you here.

678
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,580
What good will that do?

679
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:04,410
There's someone who's out to get me.

680
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:09,730
Was Anggeum's family rich?

681
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:10,570
Excuse me?

682
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:15,740
Did she use money as toilet paper?

683
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:19,910
She said there were gold nuggets lying around the house.

684
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,590
Is that true?

685
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:24,950
Oh, why didn't you let her win?

686
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:26,950
Did you really have to go that far?

687
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:29,300
But mother started it.

688
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:32,800
I never met anyone from up north who wasn't rich, or so they all say.

689
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,890
She was lying through her teeth,

690
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:37,770
so I decided to do the same.

691
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:40,240
If you want to yell at me, yell at her too.

692
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,430
What?

693
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:44,520
You used money as toilet paper?

694
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:47,130
Where did you get that idea?

695
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:49,880
If we had a bet, I would've won.

696
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,390
I had more things to say, but I didn't.

697
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:53,690
Like what?

698
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:58,570
Like how the pot we used for cooking rice for the servants was so big

699
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:01,300
that neighborhood children bathed in it.

700
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:05,930
How we used the leftover rice to cover our roof.

701
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:08,200
Oh, boy...

702
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,500
You and mother are like twins.

703
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:15,630
Me? Are you insane?

704
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:18,770
I can't believe you just said that!

705
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:13,190
Goodbye.

706
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:20,240
For the road.

707
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,600
I made rice balls and boiled eggs.

708
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:27,270
Father, take care of yourself.

709
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:29,150
I'm going to make it again.

710
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:31,290
I'll come back to get you.

711
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:35,100
Your mom had an amazing dream before you were born.

712

Don't worry.
You'll be successful.

713
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:41,820
I'm not worried, father.

714
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:43,350
I know I will be.

715
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:44,570
Get in!

716
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:50,190
Go. Drive carefully.

717
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,830
Goodbye, father.

718
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:54,790
Okay.

Oh, it tastes funky.
I think it's spoiled.

725
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:01,820
It's not. It tastes fine.

726
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:02,950
It's spoiled.

727
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:05,200
But he made it this morning.

728

Food spoils fast in the car.

731
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:13,050
I'm sure he wasn't careful making this.

732
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:15,080
He probably added whatever in it.

733
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:18,620
Don't eat it, then. I'll eat it.

734

What? But I'm telling you it's spoiled.

It's fine. Why do you keep saying that?

739
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,890
Do you have to insist that it's not spoiled when it is?

740
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:39,900
What if you get sick?

741
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:41,470
Don't worry about me!

742
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,600
Don't eat it out of anger.

743
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:49,110
I'm not angry. It's delicious. Really.

744
00:48:49,110 --> 00:48:52,270
It's delicious because my father made it.

It's not much, but I hope it helps.

00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:03,830
And we have to move out.

827
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:08,370
We have nothing.

828
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:12,150
Say something!

829
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:15,070
What are we going to do now?

830
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:18,310
How could you not tell me anything?

831
00:56:18,310 --> 00:56:21,060
How could you betray me like this?

832
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:23,780
I'm sorry.

833
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:24,970
You're sorry?

834
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:28,390
You think that's enough?

835
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:31,460
Okay. Blame me.

836
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:33,990
Yell at me and hate me.

837
00:56:34,590 --> 00:56:37,970
What are we going to do? What?

838
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:41,020
Let's move in with my father.

839
00:56:42,310 --> 00:56:44,000
Your father?

840
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,430
Stay with my father.

841
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:46,470
Take the girls and when I...

842
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:50,050
Stop. Don't utter another word.

843
00:56:55,140 --> 00:57:00,350
Mom!

844
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:09,950
Miho, can you take her?

845
00:57:09,950 --> 00:57:11,980
Yes, mother.

846
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:16,480
Make her some formula and change her diaper.

847
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,530
I can do it, mother, so you can go.

848
00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:23,980
It feels like an unlucky day for you, so be careful.

849
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:25,950
Ugh!

850
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:29,080
Whats this?
What's all this?

851
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:30,570
Oh, mom!

852
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:34,580
Mom, don't touch them!
It's against the law!

853
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:36,200
Law? What law?

854
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:39,120
Subak hand picked every single one!

855
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:44,540
How could you let this happen, huh?

856
00:57:45,770 --> 00:57:47,070
I'm sorry.

857
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:50,460
How can she live in the countryside?

858
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:52,460
How can you even suggest that?

859
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:57,970
She couldn't be more miserable right now,
and you tell her to go live with your father?

860
00:57:57,970 --> 00:57:59,220
Take your mom and go home.

861
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:00,560
Let's go home.

862
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,640
Why won't you say anything?

863
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:06,300
Why are you so quiet all of a sudden?

864
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:12,260
Subak can't even poo in an old style bathroom!

865
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:16,540
She can't even wash her own underwear,
so how can you send her away with the girls?

866
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:18,620
I won't let her go! I won't!

867
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:21,560
I'd rather die than see that!

868
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:24,480
Mom...

869
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,670
I can't believe my eyes.

870
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,400
How can she fall asleep to the dog sound?

871
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:44,720
Shh...

872
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,780
I think they know what's going on.

873
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:51,720
They wouldn't go to sleep.

874
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:54,270
The person you are calling is temporarily...

875
00:58:54,270 --> 00:58:56,160
Your sister won't pick up the phone.

876
00:59:01,910 --> 00:59:03,420
Subak?

877
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:05,520
She's not here. Isn't she there?

878
00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:07,330
She's not there?

879
00:59:07,330 --> 00:59:09,370
No. Minjung thought she was here.

880
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:13,110
I hope she's not doing anything stupid.

881
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:21,320
- Subak!
- Subak!

882
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:24,090
Mom, mom, that way!
Minjung, let's not...

883
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:27,420
Let's split up.
You and dad go that way.

884
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:29,190
You and uncle turn left.

885
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:31,750
- Okay.
- Mom and I will...

886
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:33,350
Subak!

887
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:36,220
Call me!

888
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:42,320
Subak!

889
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:44,680
Subak!

890
00:59:45,390 --> 00:59:46,750
- Did you find her?
- No.

891
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:48,940
She's not here, either.
Let's go that way.

892
00:59:53,350 --> 00:59:54,410
Father.

893
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:56,570
- What happened?
- You must be tired.

894
00:59:56,570 --> 00:59:58,570
Go home. I'll keep looking.

895
01:00:04,890 --> 01:00:07,640
Subak! Subak...

896
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:08,550
Mom!

897
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:14,150
- Subak!
- Subak!

898
01:00:14,730 --> 01:00:18,930
We've been looking for you everywhere!

899
01:00:18,930 --> 01:00:20,240
Subak.

900
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:22,210
Let's go home.

901
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:25,070
You can't eat, you can't sleep...

902
01:00:25,070 --> 01:00:27,070
You're going to get sick.

903
01:00:27,070 --> 01:00:28,440
Mom.

904
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:29,330
Yes?

905
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:34,370
I'm exhausted.
I don't want to do anything.

906
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:39,990
I don't want to move a finger,
and I don't want to see my girls.

907
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:44,290
I have to force myself to eat.

908
01:00:44,290 --> 01:00:46,800
I go on living because I'm alive.

909
01:00:48,570 --> 01:00:50,930
Everyone else in the world is having fun,

910
01:00:52,350 --> 01:00:55,100
but I'm here, feeling all miserable.

911
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:58,010
I feel lost and angry.

912
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:00,870
Oh, no, what should we do...

913
01:01:00,870 --> 01:01:02,150
Subak...

914
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:06,540
I want to close my eyes and die.

915
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:11,840
Oh, no...
What should we do...

916
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:16,510
My poor Subak...

917
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:21,160
Subak...

918
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:05,570
Huh?

919
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:18,840
Mom.

920
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,460
Are you busy?

921
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:24,590
Look at how sweaty you are!

922
01:02:24,590 --> 01:02:27,000
You look awful.

923
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,740
How did you find this place?

924
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:32,920
This is where my darling daughter works.

925
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:36,290
What's going on?

926
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:39,360
I have something to talk to you about.

927
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:41,850
With me?

928
01:02:49,020 --> 01:03:03,870
Subtitles by KBS World

929
01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:05,420
It must be hard for you.

930
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:09,090
Father, can you talk to Subak?

931
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:13,310
I saved every penny I could,
and I wore clothes people throw out...

932
01:03:13,910 --> 01:03:15,710
I can't use this money on anyone else.

933
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:17,350
I'm going to use it on my kids.

934
01:03:17,350 --> 01:03:19,130
How can you do this to your own mom?

935
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:20,750
I can't stand you, so leave!

936
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:23,130
Let's tell Subak to move in with us.

937
01:03:23,130 --> 01:03:24,120
No way!

938
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:26,650
Please close out all my savings accounts.

939
01:03:26,650 --> 01:03:27,910
Were you playing with me?

940
01:03:27,910 --> 01:03:29,780
Why wouldn't you reply to my text messages?

941
01:03:29,780 --> 01:03:30,870
You left me hanging.

942
01:03:30,870 --> 01:03:32,660
Why are you acting this way?

943
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:36,180
I was honest with you,
and you made a fool of me!
