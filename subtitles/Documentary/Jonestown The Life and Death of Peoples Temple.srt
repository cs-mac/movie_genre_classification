1
00:00:17,919 --> 00:00:22,686
<i>Let me tell you a story.
A story of life and death.</i>

2
00:00:23,225 --> 00:00:24,487
<i>My death.</i>

3
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,790
<i>But before we go there, we need to
go back to a time where it all started,</i>

4
00:00:29,865 --> 00:00:33,198
<i>when God was getting busy
with the creation of the universe,</i>

5
00:00:33,268 --> 00:00:35,930
<i>where there was only cosmic goo.</i>

6
00:00:36,004 --> 00:00:38,165
<i>God's Play-Doh, if you will.</i>

7
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,233
<i>While God was messing with this
Play-Doh, creating all living things,</i>

8
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,939
<i>he put death into
a ceramic jar for safekeeping,</i>

9
00:00:46,014 --> 00:00:48,778
<i>until he could figure out
what to do with it.</i>

10
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:51,751
<i>One day, God gave the jar
to a frog and a toad</i>

11
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:57,190
<i>to guard it from harm while he went
off to create something more fantastic.</i>

12
00:00:57,259 --> 00:01:00,626
<i>Why he gave it to a frog
and a toad, I'll never know.</i>

13
00:01:00,695 --> 00:01:03,255
<i>But one thing led to another.</i>

14
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:06,391
<i>The jar shattered,
letting death out.</i>

15
00:01:06,468 --> 00:01:09,335
<i>And ever since,
everything has to die.</i>

16
00:01:09,404 --> 00:01:13,568
<i>So there you have it.
The mystery of death finally revealed.</i>

17
00:01:13,642 --> 00:01:16,543
<i>Which brings us to my story.</i>

18
00:01:16,611 --> 00:01:20,274
<i>Everybody dies.
That's just the way it is.</i>

19
00:01:20,348 --> 00:01:24,045
<i>The life clock ticks at
the same speed for everyone.</i>

20
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:27,282
<i>And we all know that
one day that clock will stop.</i>

21
00:01:27,355 --> 00:01:31,086
<i>And when it does,
we're only going to have time to say...</i>

22
00:01:34,863 --> 00:01:37,423
<i>I'm told I'm not supposed
to argue or question,</i>

23
00:01:37,499 --> 00:01:40,127
<i>or even try to understand.</i>

24
00:01:40,202 --> 00:01:41,601
<i>I'm told it a lot these days,</i>

25
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,437
<i>ever since my life was snuffed out
by a toilet seat from an old space station,</i>

26
00:01:46,508 --> 00:01:51,036
<i>and I joined the ranks of the undead
and became a grim reaper.</i>

27
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:55,139
<i>This is Rube. He's our boss.
He keeps us reapers in line.</i>

28
00:01:55,217 --> 00:01:58,778
<i>Every morning we meet Rube at
a restaurant called Der Waffle Haus,</i>

29
00:01:58,853 --> 00:02:03,017
<i>where he would review the list which
has who's to die, when and where,</i>

30
00:02:03,091 --> 00:02:04,752
<i>which he writes out on a Post-it</i>

31
00:02:04,826 --> 00:02:07,294
<i>and then passes on
to all the grim reapers.</i>

32
00:02:07,362 --> 00:02:10,490
<i>Rube says that you don't
mess around with fate, peanut.</i>

33
00:02:10,565 --> 00:02:14,729
<i>People die when they are meant to die.
You cannot intervene in any way.</i>

34
00:02:14,803 --> 00:02:17,237
<i>When life is done, it's done.</i>

35
00:02:17,305 --> 00:02:20,706
<i>We, the undead, are meant to exist
on the fringe of the living world.</i>

36
00:02:20,775 --> 00:02:23,972
<i>We can move freely
among the living to do our job.</i>

37
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:29,416
<i>My name is George Lass.
I've been dead for five years.</i>

38
00:02:30,385 --> 00:02:32,285
<i>I take souls for a living.</i>

39
00:02:33,021 --> 00:02:35,922
<i>My division is External Influence.</i>

40
00:02:35,991 --> 00:02:39,256
<i>murders,</i>

41
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:44,424
<i>natural disasters, accidents, et cetera.</i>

42
00:02:44,499 --> 00:02:46,831
<i>And I do mean et cetera.</i>

43
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,074
<i>Hi, yes, Professor Gregor?</i>

44
00:03:33,148 --> 00:03:36,015
<i>This is Mr. Fielding from
the Arthur Barrisford Foundation.</i>

45
00:03:36,084 --> 00:03:37,415
<i>I am thrilled to announce to you</i>

46
00:03:37,485 --> 00:03:39,350
<i>that you have finally
been named the recipient</i>

47
00:03:40,622 --> 00:03:42,317
<i>of our $500,000 genius grant.</i>

48
00:03:56,938 --> 00:03:59,668
<i>That ugly guy?
He's a graveling.</i>

49
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:03,438
<i>They set things in motion.
And once things start moving,</i>

50
00:04:03,511 --> 00:04:05,103
<i>look out below.</i>

51
00:04:05,914 --> 00:04:08,610
<i>The sun rises, the sun sets.</i>

52
00:04:08,683 --> 00:04:12,813
<i>Life comes, and for a
once successful inventor</i>

53
00:04:12,887 --> 00:04:15,583
<i>who's down on his luck, life goes.</i>

54
00:04:20,995 --> 00:04:23,225
Welcome to the afterlife, Mr. Gregor.

55
00:04:23,298 --> 00:04:26,995
Sorry about the last-minute reaping,
but we don't normally do suicides,

56
00:04:27,068 --> 00:04:29,832
so I wasn't sure you were
our man till the last second.

57
00:04:29,904 --> 00:04:32,668
I don't care.
I won. I finally won.

58
00:04:32,741 --> 00:04:35,039
Yes, you did, the jackpot.

59
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,270
Now, into your lights.

60
00:04:36,344 --> 00:04:38,642
You know, I thought it would
hurt more, but it didn't. Not at all.

61
00:04:38,713 --> 00:04:40,874
Well, that's 'cause
I took your soul before you died.

62
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:43,349
Oh! Well, thank you
very much, Miss, uh...

63
00:04:43,418 --> 00:04:45,409
Lass, but you can call me George.

64
00:04:46,554 --> 00:04:49,079
Am I gonna see you again
where I'm going towards?

65
00:04:49,491 --> 00:04:50,549
Eventually.

66
00:04:51,726 --> 00:04:52,988
When I get my lights.

67
00:04:53,762 --> 00:04:55,286
I don't know when.

68
00:04:57,699 --> 00:04:59,929
Death is full of surprises, huh?

69
00:05:02,103 --> 00:05:03,764
You have no idea.

70
00:05:28,163 --> 00:05:29,790
<i>I love morning reaps,</i>

71
00:05:29,864 --> 00:05:33,095
<i>accomplishing so much
when everyone else is still in bed,</i>

72
00:05:33,168 --> 00:05:36,365
<i>and I still have the whole day ahead of me.</i>

73
00:05:36,438 --> 00:05:40,704
<i>Reapers are assigned an unspecified
allotment of souls to collect.</i>

74
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:42,265
<i>You don't know how many souls</i>

75
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:46,279
<i>until you've nabbed the last one,
and then you move on.</i>

76
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:50,078
<i>Moving on, much like death,
has its own timetable.</i>

77
00:05:50,151 --> 00:05:52,676
<i>You don't know when
it's going to happen until it happens.</i>

78
00:05:52,754 --> 00:05:57,123
<i>And today, fate is telling
our band of merry grim reapers</i>

79
00:05:57,192 --> 00:05:59,456
<i>to move on from Der Waffle Haus.</i>

80
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:01,893
- Smells like bacon.
Looks like arson.

81
00:06:01,963 --> 00:06:04,625
Where the hell
is Rube? I need my coffee.

82
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:07,896
People, this is hallowed ground.
Show some respect.

83
00:06:07,969 --> 00:06:11,132
<i>I'm showing respect.
Auf wiedersehen, Der Waffle Haus.</i>

84
00:06:11,206 --> 00:06:13,766
Fond farewell
to a shitty little restaurant.

85
00:06:13,842 --> 00:06:16,834
Which didn't extend me
any more credit, so fuck you.

86
00:06:16,911 --> 00:06:20,244
Did you have something to do
with this fire, you limey bastard?

87
00:06:20,315 --> 00:06:22,078
First of all, I don't need
to answer that, 'cause I...

88
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,812
How about I just make it
so every time you kneel

89
00:06:24,886 --> 00:06:27,116
in front of a glory hole,
you think of me?

90
00:06:30,592 --> 00:06:31,616
I already do!

91
00:06:34,762 --> 00:06:37,458
He didn't do it, Roxy.
He's not that smart.

92
00:06:37,532 --> 00:06:39,056
Thanks, George.

93
00:06:40,802 --> 00:06:41,996
Excuse me!

94
00:06:42,904 --> 00:06:45,338
I'm here to pick up Daisy...

95
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,999
<i>Uses sex to get her way.</i>

96
00:06:48,076 --> 00:06:49,270
...Roxy...

97
00:06:49,344 --> 00:06:50,902
<i>She could kick your ass.</i>

98
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:52,003
...Mason...

99
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,014
<i>Ah, Mason, Mason, Mason.</i>

100
00:06:54,082 --> 00:06:55,344
...and George.

101
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:58,044
<i>They call me "'toilet seat girl. "'</i>

102
00:07:01,856 --> 00:07:03,949
Yes. That's right.

103
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:07,656
Wait! He's supposed
to open the door for us.

104
00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:10,027
Oh, my bad.
I didn't go to prom.

105
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:12,830
Thank you.

106
00:07:13,134 --> 00:07:14,601
Ooh, snacky snacks.

107
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:18,161
<i>In the space-time continuum,
everything changes.</i>

108
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,865
<i>- Whoo!
Change can be slow.</i>

109
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:23,170
Show me your tits!

110
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:25,739
Whoa!

111
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:30,409
<i>Change can be fast.
Change can be welcomed or feared,</i>

112
00:07:30,485 --> 00:07:35,650
<i>or it can come to you in a black limo
and take you to a fancy restaurant.</i>

113
00:07:35,723 --> 00:07:38,248
<i>One thing you can
count on is change.</i>

114
00:07:42,997 --> 00:07:45,056
No. Look,
I told you already, no.

115
00:07:45,433 --> 00:07:46,627
No means no.

116
00:07:46,701 --> 00:07:48,965
I'm not gonna change
my mind. Oh, one second.

117
00:07:50,104 --> 00:07:53,403
Ah, there you all are.
Welcome. Please, have a seat.

118
00:07:54,075 --> 00:07:55,406
Daisy.

119
00:07:56,477 --> 00:08:00,311
<i>Died on the set of
Gone with the Wind, 1939.</i>

120
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:06,217
- Mason.
- What?

121
00:08:06,754 --> 00:08:09,416
Drilled a hole in your head, 1966.

122
00:08:14,128 --> 00:08:18,121
Roxy, strangled with a legwarmer in 1982.

123
00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:22,598
And George,

124
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:26,697
killed by a toilet seat
from outer space in 2003.

125
00:08:27,275 --> 00:08:30,642
<i>Better off dead
Better off dead</i>

126
00:08:32,413 --> 00:08:33,710
Oh. Excuse me.

127
00:08:34,816 --> 00:08:35,805
Um...

128
00:08:36,117 --> 00:08:39,848
Okay, not to be all, "What the fuck?"
about this, but...

129
00:08:39,921 --> 00:08:41,320
What the fuck?

130
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:45,655
Look, uh, our workload
is going to increase,

131
00:08:45,727 --> 00:08:47,695
and we need better ways
to stay connected.

132
00:08:48,863 --> 00:08:53,960
Now, this Post-it business was fine,
but now we're with the Treos.

133
00:08:54,035 --> 00:08:55,229
Old habits die hard,

134
00:08:55,303 --> 00:08:57,635
and if you guys still want to
meet for your early morning chats,

135
00:08:57,705 --> 00:09:00,902
then this table has
a standing res in my name.

136
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:03,876
I can't promise I'll be there every day,

137
00:09:03,945 --> 00:09:06,971
but you can always
get a hold of me on here,

138
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:10,506
or text me, or e-mail me.

139
00:09:11,686 --> 00:09:14,746
- Who...
- Sorry, overseas market's just closing.

140
00:09:14,822 --> 00:09:17,655
- ... are you?
- Kane, sell it.

141
00:09:18,993 --> 00:09:20,392
Sorry about that.

142
00:09:20,461 --> 00:09:26,093
Cameron Kane, died 9/11,
fell 85 stories and never felt a thing.

143
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:29,659
I think I met your sister last night.
She gave me a lap dance. Candy?

144
00:09:29,737 --> 00:09:31,466
But who are you?

145
00:09:31,973 --> 00:09:34,840
Meet the new boss.
Well, Rube got his lights.

146
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:38,072
He had to, uh...
He had to move on.

147
00:09:38,146 --> 00:09:40,876
They headhunted me because of
my ass-kicking performance stats,

148
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:42,540
and they brought me in
to reconfigure your branch

149
00:09:42,617 --> 00:09:46,678
because, quite frankly, it had gotten
a little slack under the old guard.

150
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:48,949
Your assignments
will be on your Treos,

151
00:09:49,891 --> 00:09:53,918
the car is at your disposal,
and breakfast is, uh, my treat.

152
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:01,362
In perpetuity.

153
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:07,073
I can't wait to get started.
We are gonna be a great team.

154
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,349
What the fuck? I'm hungry.

155
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:18,146
- He's lying.
- No, I'm not.

156
00:10:18,219 --> 00:10:21,552
- Not you. Cameron.
- Lying about what?

157
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:25,285
Rube. About Rube
going away forever.

158
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:27,293
Do you think he did
something to Rube?

159
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:31,491
- Why would he do that?
- I don't know. Some kind of coup.

160
00:10:31,566 --> 00:10:35,502
What, to take over
our illustrious team of grim reapers?

161
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,130
- No one's that dumb.
- She's right, Roxy.

162
00:10:38,206 --> 00:10:42,199
It just doesn't make sense. Unless
he heard about my staggering beauty.

163
00:10:42,276 --> 00:10:43,265
Ugh.

164
00:10:43,344 --> 00:10:46,279
He heard you were a stank-ass ho
that'd go down on Clark Gable

165
00:10:46,347 --> 00:10:49,714
to play an extra on the plantation.
That's what he heard.

166
00:10:49,784 --> 00:10:54,653
- You see how he took her chair out?
- And my phone-y thingy is greeny.

167
00:10:55,323 --> 00:10:56,551
And?

168
00:10:56,624 --> 00:10:58,819
And it matches my eyes.
It's my favorite color.

169
00:10:58,893 --> 00:11:00,485
If Rube was still around,

170
00:11:00,561 --> 00:11:03,052
he would have been at
the Waffle Haus this morning.

171
00:11:03,131 --> 00:11:06,623
He would have found us.
He would have.

172
00:11:06,701 --> 00:11:07,929
Goddamn it!

173
00:11:08,002 --> 00:11:10,368
We didn't even have
a chance to say goodbye.

174
00:11:10,438 --> 00:11:11,700
Fuck him.

175
00:11:19,213 --> 00:11:20,373
Where to?

176
00:11:20,448 --> 00:11:23,178
Uh, I've gotta get back
to my car. I'm late for work.

177
00:11:23,251 --> 00:11:25,412
Yes, ma'am. Anyone else?

178
00:11:25,486 --> 00:11:29,650
Yes, um, 11 Stratford,
no, Stubens Place.

179
00:11:30,825 --> 00:11:31,917
I have 45 minutes, so we
can drop George off first.

180
00:11:31,993 --> 00:11:34,461
Oh, wait, I'll come with you
'cause, um, I'm much, much later.

181
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:36,827
How do you work this damn thing?

182
00:11:38,599 --> 00:11:39,998
Looks like you get the day off.

183
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,125
Excuse me?

184
00:11:42,436 --> 00:11:43,562
Oh, no. Look, I got another one.

185
00:11:43,638 --> 00:11:46,198
They're almost back-to-back. Look at that.

186
00:11:46,274 --> 00:11:49,710
You get two, I get none?
Rube would never do this.

187
00:11:49,777 --> 00:11:51,267
Well, I don't like it
any more than you do.

188
00:11:51,345 --> 00:11:52,972
Well, give me one of yours, then.

189
00:11:53,047 --> 00:11:54,241
You can't take her reap.

190
00:11:54,315 --> 00:11:57,216
- I can if she got two.
- Hey, shut the fuck up.

191
00:11:58,553 --> 00:12:00,521
Reap is slang for...

192
00:12:00,588 --> 00:12:03,523
Reap is slang for when we take
the soul out of a body who's just...

193
00:12:03,591 --> 00:12:05,422
Sales meeting,
and we make commissions.

194
00:12:05,493 --> 00:12:07,427
We're very competitive.

195
00:12:07,495 --> 00:12:08,962
I understand.

196
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,963
There's no way in hell
she gets two reaps.

197
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:19,370
It has to be a mistake.

198
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,601
Well, I think it shows
a sensitivity on his part.

199
00:12:21,676 --> 00:12:22,768
So do I.

200
00:12:22,844 --> 00:12:24,334
I think he knew you
were gonna be all touchy

201
00:12:24,412 --> 00:12:27,813
about him taking over,
so he let you slide.

202
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,846
So why didn't Mr. Sensitive
let you guys slide?

203
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:34,888
Because you're the only one
who wants Rube's old fucking job.

204
00:12:36,157 --> 00:12:39,752
Listen, I have a bit of a time
crunch. Could use your help.

205
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:44,059
All right, we'll take the squad car.
I'll use the lights if I have to.

206
00:12:46,334 --> 00:12:47,892
<i>Everything changes.</i>

207
00:12:47,969 --> 00:12:50,938
<i>Just when I get used to
the way things are in life,</i>

208
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:53,197
<i>or in my case, death...</i>

209
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:55,433
Asshole!

210
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:56,999
<i>...death throws you a curve.</i>

211
00:12:57,078 --> 00:13:02,277
<i>That's the space-time continuum
for you, full of surprises.</i>

212
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:08,317
That was entirely uncalled for!

213
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:11,187
<i>See, there's my
mom and my sister Reggie.</i>

214
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:14,695
My daughter is only 16!
She's just learning how to drive.

215
00:13:14,762 --> 00:13:18,357
<i>That's me. That's how
the living world sees me.</i>

216
00:13:18,432 --> 00:13:21,424
You should have a little consideration!

217
00:13:26,841 --> 00:13:28,706
Light's still red.
Light's still red!

218
00:13:29,944 --> 00:13:32,970
Could you please chill?
Could you please pull over?

219
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:39,252
All right. Are you
trying to get us killed?

220
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,582
It's crossed my mind.

221
00:13:40,655 --> 00:13:42,714
That's comforting.

222
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,018
Not lately, though,

223
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:46,389
because I really want
a new car for my birthday.

224
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:49,661
Actually, it can be used. I can deal.

225
00:13:50,331 --> 00:13:52,959
Oh. That's great.
You can deal, all right.

226
00:13:53,034 --> 00:13:55,093
Soon as you make
enough money from your job.

227
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:58,263
Laura got new boobs for her 16th,
and she didn't even need them.

228
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:01,536
Well, that's really sketchy behavior.

229
00:14:01,609 --> 00:14:04,271
Mmm. More shady than sketchy.

230
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,449
Yeah. Should be your father's job.

231
00:14:09,517 --> 00:14:12,611
Except that he lives,
like, a million miles away.

232
00:14:15,656 --> 00:14:20,252
When your father was teaching
George to drive, she cut someone off,

233
00:14:20,328 --> 00:14:23,764
but she thought it was their fault,
so she took both hands off the wheel

234
00:14:23,831 --> 00:14:25,492
so she could flip 'em off twice.

235
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:28,758
- Can we go now?
- Blinker!

236
00:14:28,836 --> 00:14:31,703
- All right, let them know you're coming.
- I know!

237
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,874
- Don't let it bother you.
- Okay, okay! I'll try.

238
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:41,446
But, um, just in case?

239
00:14:41,515 --> 00:14:44,416
What hand should I use
to flip somebody off?

240
00:14:45,486 --> 00:14:47,147
The one not holding the cell phone.

241
00:15:12,046 --> 00:15:15,015
Do you want to go around back?
Sneak in through the cafeteria?

242
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:16,879
It's too late.
They already saw me.

243
00:15:17,685 --> 00:15:19,983
- I love you.
- You're the only one.

244
00:15:20,688 --> 00:15:22,553
That's not true.

245
00:15:26,627 --> 00:15:29,027
That's not true.

246
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:39,503
The doctors were wonderful.

247
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:46,341
But as great as they were at
diagnosing and treating Teddy,

248
00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:52,051
they had no idea how
to tell a 12-year-old boy

249
00:15:52,553 --> 00:15:54,521
that he was going to die.

250
00:15:56,924 --> 00:16:01,361
And we couldn't do it,
so the guilt...

251
00:16:02,463 --> 00:16:03,896
Now, let me just say,

252
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:05,829
I've been running this
group for two years now,

253
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:09,131
and I have never heard from a parent
who has figured that one out. Right?

254
00:16:10,271 --> 00:16:12,205
I mean that there is no guidebook.

255
00:16:13,374 --> 00:16:15,137
How do you manage it?

256
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:16,698
To be honest, not well.

257
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:19,741
George died suddenly,

258
00:16:21,082 --> 00:16:23,710
and earlier that same day,
we had a fight.

259
00:16:24,618 --> 00:16:26,552
And I... You know, I can't
remember exactly what I said,

260
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,588
but it wasn't pleasant.

261
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:32,291
And so I've been haunted
by it for the past five years.

262
00:16:34,061 --> 00:16:37,690
So now I just make sure
that every time I say goodbye

263
00:16:37,765 --> 00:16:40,757
to my younger daughter,
I tell her I love her.

264
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:43,363
Drives her crazy.

265
00:17:09,063 --> 00:17:10,690
Morning, Crystal.

266
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:15,563
- Meow, Millie.
- Good morning, Delores.

267
00:17:15,636 --> 00:17:17,331
How was your breakfast meeting?

268
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:19,269
It's supposed to be anonymous.

269
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:21,069
Oh, I'm sorry. I keep forgetting.

270
00:17:21,142 --> 00:17:22,370
You're under too much stress.

271
00:17:22,443 --> 00:17:25,537
I just keep thinking about
somebody ratting me out,

272
00:17:25,613 --> 00:17:29,071
- bringing Murray to work.
- Everybody loves Murray.

273
00:17:30,284 --> 00:17:31,945
See how much they love him
when he gets too weak

274
00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:35,420
to use the kitty litter box
and starts spraying the bizhub.

275
00:17:35,489 --> 00:17:36,979
So take some family leave.

276
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:41,153
Spend some time with Murray
before he, you know, passes.

277
00:17:41,829 --> 00:17:45,390
There's a no-pet
clause in the contract. I checked.

278
00:17:45,466 --> 00:17:46,797
Oh. Bastards.

279
00:17:46,867 --> 00:17:48,801
I'm gonna have to put
that potty mouth of yours

280
00:17:48,869 --> 00:17:51,667
directly into Murray's kitty litter box.

281
00:17:51,739 --> 00:17:53,502
How many interviews we got today?

282
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:54,871
Sixteen.

283
00:17:55,142 --> 00:17:57,906
- Bring 'em on.
- That's my girl.

284
00:18:09,323 --> 00:18:13,054
- Oh, this is so sexy.
- How is this sexy?

285
00:18:13,127 --> 00:18:15,357
Toenails and hair all over the floor,

286
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:19,858
faces dead with too much
Botox and too much makeup.

287
00:18:19,934 --> 00:18:21,799
Looks like a mortuary, if you ask me.

288
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:23,530
Oh, I like mortuaries.
I think they're sexy.

289
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:26,095
- That's 'cause you're dead.
- No, it's 'cause he's sick.

290
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:27,401
Uh, can I help you?

291
00:18:28,943 --> 00:18:30,274
I hope so.

292
00:18:30,711 --> 00:18:32,372
Is there someone who works here

293
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:35,176
- with the last name Baenziger?
- No.

294
00:18:35,249 --> 00:18:37,911
- Oh.
Great haircut.

295
00:18:37,985 --> 00:18:42,354
I know. What about a client?
Last name Baenziger.

296
00:18:42,423 --> 00:18:44,084
Not on the books for today.

297
00:18:44,158 --> 00:18:45,625
Oh.

298
00:18:47,661 --> 00:18:49,652
Good choice.

299
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:52,324
You know, the yellow rocks
make it look like spring.

300
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:54,162
That is just what I thought.

301
00:18:54,535 --> 00:18:55,695
Yeah.

302
00:18:57,171 --> 00:18:59,605
So, do you mind if I go back
and look for my friend?

303
00:18:59,673 --> 00:19:02,039
- Yeah, be my guest.
- Thanks.

304
00:19:03,544 --> 00:19:05,569
Goody. That means we get to play,
you know...

305
00:19:05,646 --> 00:19:07,375
High-risk factor.

306
00:19:07,448 --> 00:19:08,847
Okay, ready?

307
00:19:10,551 --> 00:19:13,816
- Running with scissors.
- Barber on drugs, razor at throat.

308
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:19,853
The house is right
on the mountain. Ski in, ski out.

309
00:19:19,927 --> 00:19:22,259
My instructor says I'm a natural.

310
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:24,820
- Then there's her.
- What's high risk about her?

311
00:19:24,898 --> 00:19:27,093
Nothing. I just want her dead.

312
00:19:27,968 --> 00:19:29,094
Baenziger!

313
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:31,933
Oh, good. Now we get
to play last-minute panic.

314
00:19:32,006 --> 00:19:33,064
Hey.

315
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:37,501
Daisy.

316
00:19:43,884 --> 00:19:45,875
- Zac?
- Hi.

317
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:47,618
Is that you?

318
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:51,954
Yeah. No, uh... Sorry.
Do I know you from somewhere?

319
00:19:52,026 --> 00:19:55,359
I think so. Are you Zac Baenziger?

320
00:19:55,429 --> 00:19:59,889
Yeah. No. Yeah, that's me, for sure.
Uh, were we in high school together?

321
00:19:59,967 --> 00:20:01,025
Graveling!

322
00:20:01,101 --> 00:20:02,591
- I saw it first.
- I saw it.

323
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:06,106
It's good to see you. Really.

324
00:20:06,674 --> 00:20:07,902
Yeah.

325
00:20:09,043 --> 00:20:11,136
Sorry, I need a signature.

326
00:20:12,046 --> 00:20:13,911
Now, where did my pens go?

327
00:20:26,527 --> 00:20:27,892
There you go.
There you go.

328
00:20:34,368 --> 00:20:36,802
Call 911! Hurry!

329
00:20:40,341 --> 00:20:41,831
Hey, dead guy.

330
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:45,977
You mean those weren't candies?

331
00:20:46,046 --> 00:20:48,344
No, and we didn't go
to high school together.

332
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:50,406
We gotta go, guys.

333
00:20:50,484 --> 00:20:51,678
Thank you.

334
00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:53,447
Daisy, what about his lights?

335
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,852
Uh, he'll figure it out.
You know, we've only got 10 minutes.

336
00:20:56,857 --> 00:20:59,621
Rushing a reap! This is bad form.

337
00:21:00,327 --> 00:21:02,261
This Cameron guy
is starting to piss me off.

338
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:03,990
I think his
way is more efficient.

339
00:21:04,064 --> 00:21:06,464
I think Daisy's right.
The geezer is dead, isn't he?

340
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:09,434
I've got some lovely lemon sage
thickening conditioner for my hair.

341
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:12,597
- Look nice for the new boss.
- I don't think you're his type.

342
00:21:12,673 --> 00:21:14,698
- You are?
- I'm everybody's type.

343
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:16,436
Oh, really?
Trying to make me jealous?

344
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,171
Just stating the obvious.

345
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:24,842
- So, Mr. Harding.
- Call me Ryan.

346
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:26,780
Hold on a sec.

347
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:30,319
Ryan, let the potential
employer address you formally

348
00:21:30,391 --> 00:21:32,256
if that's what she chooses.

349
00:21:32,326 --> 00:21:34,794
First names may be taboo
in her place of business,

350
00:21:34,862 --> 00:21:39,356
and if that's the case,
you just talked yourself out of a job.

351
00:21:40,601 --> 00:21:42,000
Go ahead.

352
00:21:42,069 --> 00:21:46,005
What do you think is your greatest
accomplishment in life so far, Mr. Harding?

353
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,333
I'm 26.

354
00:21:48,442 --> 00:21:51,878
By the age of 26, Tiger Woods
had already won the Grand Slam.

355
00:21:51,945 --> 00:21:55,745
At 26, Henry Ford
had invented the Model T.

356
00:21:55,816 --> 00:21:58,376
By the time he was 26,
Alexander the Great...

357
00:21:58,452 --> 00:22:00,249
Had become a homo.
- Ryan.

358
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,050
If she insists on
comparing me to successful people,

359
00:22:03,123 --> 00:22:05,353
- of course I'm gonna fall short.
- Oh, get over it.

360
00:22:05,426 --> 00:22:06,620
May I, Millie?

361
00:22:08,796 --> 00:22:10,627
What do we do here?

362
00:22:11,732 --> 00:22:13,165
We're a temp agency.

363
00:22:13,233 --> 00:22:14,564
Mmm-hmm.

364
00:22:14,768 --> 00:22:16,292
Millie?

365
00:22:16,637 --> 00:22:19,504
We're an agency that gets people jobs

366
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:21,269
that are temporary.

367
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:24,868
We are a corporate dating service.

368
00:22:24,945 --> 00:22:27,038
And if we want to find the right match,

369
00:22:27,114 --> 00:22:31,073
we have to understand
the sine qua non of that person.

370
00:22:31,151 --> 00:22:33,676
We have to find out
what makes someone special.

371
00:22:33,754 --> 00:22:36,814
We have to ask questions
that catch people off guard,

372
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:39,586
that really pull their masks off.

373
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,628
Like, "What's your most
treasured possession?"

374
00:22:41,695 --> 00:22:42,753
My cat.

375
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,889
How about, "What's the best
birthday gift you ever got?"

376
00:22:46,099 --> 00:22:47,623
My cat. People, these
don't catch people off guard.

377
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:50,135
We need a question like, uh...

378
00:22:51,138 --> 00:22:53,072
Questions like,

379
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,665
"What's the one thing you
want to do before you die?"

380
00:22:55,742 --> 00:22:58,336
Now that's a great question.

381
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:03,512
Carry on. Doing great.

382
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,214
Answer the question, Ryan.

383
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:10,415
- Do you want me to answer honestly?
- Of course.

384
00:23:10,491 --> 00:23:12,482
That's easy. He wants to get laid.

385
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,686
- Amy!
- No, she's right.

386
00:23:14,761 --> 00:23:18,288
Okay,
you know, let's start over,

387
00:23:18,365 --> 00:23:20,731
and feel free to lie this time.

388
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:33,002
<i>There were a lot of things
I wanted to do before I died.</i>

389
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:35,975
<i>I don't know what they were</i>

390
00:23:36,049 --> 00:23:38,574
<i>because I never asked
myself that question.</i>

391
00:23:38,652 --> 00:23:40,847
What the fuck?

392
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:46,589
<i>Whoever H. Hart is,</i>

393
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:51,962
<i>I hope he or she asked the question,
because their clock is about to stop.</i>

394
00:23:57,471 --> 00:23:59,666
<i>High-risk factors.</i>

395
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,537
Hey, stop. Stop.

396
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:05,374
<i>So many possibilities, so little time.</i>

397
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:27,058
The driver didn't
even stop to see if he was okay.

398
00:24:27,134 --> 00:24:30,570
Hang tough, Jenny.
Hudson will be all right.

399
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:33,834
Hudson's got heart.
Hudson's got heart.

400
00:24:33,907 --> 00:24:35,431
What's that you're saying?

401
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:38,307
It's one of our cheers.

402
00:24:38,378 --> 00:24:40,869
I mean, all the football
players have one.

403
00:24:40,948 --> 00:24:43,246
I mean, except Gustav Guducek,

404
00:24:43,317 --> 00:24:46,150
because, well,
nothing rhymes with that.

405
00:24:46,219 --> 00:24:47,686
And, I mean,
Hudson's is easy, right?

406
00:24:47,754 --> 00:24:49,449
I mean, there's part
and dart, and all that stuff.

407
00:24:49,523 --> 00:24:51,423
And then, well, we decided

408
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:54,016
how sweet and easy
if we just used his name?

409
00:24:54,094 --> 00:24:55,823
Hudson's got heart.

410
00:24:57,164 --> 00:24:58,358
Get it?

411
00:25:00,934 --> 00:25:02,401
That's Hudson Hart?

412
00:25:02,469 --> 00:25:03,561
Yeah.

413
00:25:45,112 --> 00:25:46,602
Excuse me.

414
00:25:47,848 --> 00:25:50,180
I told you to look
like a million bucks.

415
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:53,083
- Well, I never got your message.
- Okay, obviously.

416
00:25:53,153 --> 00:25:55,314
- Oh, Georgia, I have the best news.
- Not me.

417
00:25:55,389 --> 00:25:57,823
Cameron seriously
screwed up on my reap time.

418
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:01,327
Oh, dear, that's too bad.
But enough about you.

419
00:26:01,395 --> 00:26:03,022
I'm returning to the theater.

420
00:26:03,096 --> 00:26:05,530
Returning?
I thought you only did movies.

421
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:07,965
- What's the difference?
- A live audience?

422
00:26:08,035 --> 00:26:11,596
Oh, silly George, Cameron
introduced me to Ronald Gluckster.

423
00:26:11,672 --> 00:26:12,696
Who?

424
00:26:12,773 --> 00:26:16,732
The producer. And he loves me.
And I'm understudying Lady Macbeth.

425
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:19,608
<i>- I start rehearsals demain.
- Did you have to blow him?</i>

426
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,342
<i>No. In fact, he said
I have a certain je ne sais quoi.</i>

427
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:24,509
- Do you know what that means?
- That you're gonna have to blow him.

428
00:26:24,584 --> 00:26:27,485
Daisy, Cameron seriously
screwed up my reap.

429
00:26:27,854 --> 00:26:30,880
Oh, that's too bad for you.
But you should have a drink. It's a party.

430
00:26:30,957 --> 00:26:34,017
I've had five glasses of Cristal.
I could get used to this.

431
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:35,925
- Where's Mason?
- Mmm.

432
00:26:35,996 --> 00:26:37,258
In heaven.

433
00:26:38,732 --> 00:26:40,700
Oh, there's the mayor.

434
00:26:50,177 --> 00:26:52,941
Georgie Porgie pudding and...

435
00:26:53,013 --> 00:26:55,743
...Pie? I don't know.

436
00:26:55,816 --> 00:26:58,614
Look what Cameron
bought me for my birthday.

437
00:26:58,685 --> 00:27:01,552
- It's not your birthday.
- Georgie, shut up.

438
00:27:01,621 --> 00:27:05,079
- I don't want to offend my presents.
- There's plenty of time for that later.

439
00:27:05,158 --> 00:27:06,989
This is Tiffany.

440
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,084
Hi.

441
00:27:08,161 --> 00:27:10,322
And this is Tiffany.

442
00:27:10,397 --> 00:27:11,421
Hi.

443
00:27:12,432 --> 00:27:15,492
How fucking funny is that?

444
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:17,760
All you're missing
is the little blue box.

445
00:27:17,838 --> 00:27:20,204
Oh, do you know what lives
inside little blue boxes?

446
00:27:20,273 --> 00:27:21,900
Seriously, do you? Do you?

447
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:24,842
- No, please tell me.
- Necrophiliacs.

448
00:27:24,911 --> 00:27:26,538
Cameron screwed up my reap.

449
00:27:26,613 --> 00:27:29,309
And little tiny Eskimos
who live in little ice blocks,

450
00:27:29,382 --> 00:27:31,509
and they get eaten by lions,
and they're really sad.

451
00:27:31,585 --> 00:27:33,348
- Are you listening to me?
- Mmm-hmm.

452
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:36,787
There is a soul trapped in
agony out there right now.

453
00:27:36,857 --> 00:27:38,154
Oh, no!

454
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:41,919
Oh, I don't care.
It's happened before, innit?

455
00:27:41,995 --> 00:27:44,930
Not like this.
Not when Rube was in charge.

456
00:27:45,499 --> 00:27:48,434
Fuck Rube. Fuck Rube.
It's not my bloody problem.

457
00:27:48,502 --> 00:27:50,060
Seriously, I don't care.

458
00:27:50,137 --> 00:27:52,002
Where's Roxy?

459
00:27:52,072 --> 00:27:53,767
You know
what is my problem, though?

460
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,573
I really need some Viagra in, like,
an IV thing that goes in your arm.

461
00:27:58,645 --> 00:28:00,169
Yeah. I love you.

462
00:28:00,247 --> 00:28:03,683
- You don't look so hot.
- I got boned with bad reap info.

463
00:28:04,985 --> 00:28:07,317
That shit don't float in my bowl.

464
00:28:07,621 --> 00:28:10,021
- What did Cameron say?
- I haven't found him yet.

465
00:28:10,524 --> 00:28:11,923
Follow me.

466
00:28:13,026 --> 00:28:15,824
Cameron! George needs some answers.

467
00:28:15,896 --> 00:28:17,796
Ah, Roxy. Just who I was looking for.

468
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:20,298
Have you said hello to
Police Commissioner Cusek?

469
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:23,200
Commissioner, it's
an honor and a privilege.

470
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:24,669
Pleasure's all mine, Officer.

471
00:28:24,738 --> 00:28:27,229
I was just telling the Commissioner
here that there aren't enough

472
00:28:27,307 --> 00:28:30,333
African-American ranking
officers in the police force.

473
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:32,970
Now, maybe it's time
for a promotion, hmm?

474
00:28:33,046 --> 00:28:36,345
I don't want any affirmative
action quota bullshit.

475
00:28:36,416 --> 00:28:39,817
Well, then,
how about a drink?

476
00:28:41,855 --> 00:28:43,584
Love to.

477
00:28:44,925 --> 00:28:46,392
See you later.

478
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:52,799
Ah, so glad you could make it.
I was getting worried about you.

479
00:28:52,866 --> 00:28:56,461
You should be worried.
You gave me the wrong reap time.

480
00:28:56,536 --> 00:28:58,333
Easy, princess.

481
00:28:59,773 --> 00:29:01,365
What happened?

482
00:29:01,441 --> 00:29:03,568
The Treo said 5:52.

483
00:29:03,643 --> 00:29:07,477
I was there early, but H. Hart
had already been hit by the car

484
00:29:07,547 --> 00:29:09,344
and taken away to the hospital.

485
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:11,748
So he was in the ambulance at 5:52.

486
00:29:11,818 --> 00:29:14,787
- Long gone.
- Then he was DOA.

487
00:29:14,855 --> 00:29:18,484
But I didn't even touch him.
Not even close.

488
00:29:19,593 --> 00:29:21,220
Then I suggest

489
00:29:22,696 --> 00:29:24,891
you go to the hospital

490
00:29:25,265 --> 00:29:27,495
and make sure your boy is dead.

491
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:35,702
Take care of business, princess,
and go reap his soul.

492
00:29:59,733 --> 00:30:02,429
<i>Dr. Orton to OR one, post op.</i>

493
00:30:02,502 --> 00:30:04,697
<i>Dr. Orton to OR one, post op.</i>

494
00:30:09,409 --> 00:30:12,742
- Yes, may I help you?
- I'm looking for Hudson.

495
00:30:12,812 --> 00:30:14,279
Oh, I'm sorry, miss.

496
00:30:14,347 --> 00:30:16,406
His parents can't
even see him right now.

497
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:17,848
You'll have to wait
with everyone else.

498
00:30:17,918 --> 00:30:19,749
No, I just need to see his body.

499
00:30:20,854 --> 00:30:22,446
To say goodbye?

500
00:30:22,689 --> 00:30:24,554
Don't
rush him to heaven, honey.

501
00:30:24,624 --> 00:30:25,921
He's still hanging in there.

502
00:30:25,992 --> 00:30:27,823
He is?

503
00:30:28,061 --> 00:30:30,495
Must have been
touched by an angel.

504
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:35,232
The waiting area
is around the corner.

505
00:30:36,803 --> 00:30:38,395
- This way.
- Thanks.

506
00:30:40,073 --> 00:30:42,132
This can't be happening.

507
00:30:43,476 --> 00:30:45,706
I just spoke to him this morning.

508
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,873
I can't believe
we're here now.

509
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:52,875
I don't want Hudson to die.

510
00:31:14,107 --> 00:31:16,541
Doctor, is my father gonna be okay?

511
00:31:18,578 --> 00:31:20,068
I hope so.

512
00:31:20,347 --> 00:31:23,373
Good. Here's a picture
to put on your fridge.

513
00:31:27,354 --> 00:31:28,685
Thank you.

514
00:31:29,222 --> 00:31:31,087
There's the ship,
there's the plane,

515
00:31:31,157 --> 00:31:32,988
and there's a fast, fast bike.

516
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,621
Are you planning your getaway?

517
00:31:35,695 --> 00:31:37,560
I like to go very fast.

518
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:39,422
Oh.

519
00:31:41,601 --> 00:31:43,592
Tara, sweetheart, it's time to go.

520
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,952
<i>Give a kid a crayon
and she'll draw you a picture</i>

521
00:32:03,023 --> 00:32:05,685
<i>of how she's getting
the hell out of Dodge.</i>

522
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:08,557
<i>Every kid seems to be
planning her escape.</i>

523
00:32:08,628 --> 00:32:11,791
<i>You want a picture of a house,
you have to ask for it.</i>

524
00:32:13,566 --> 00:32:14,897
It's done.

525
00:32:16,236 --> 00:32:17,669
Wow!

526
00:32:17,804 --> 00:32:21,535
- George, you have talent.
- I know. It's me there.

527
00:32:21,975 --> 00:32:24,068
Well, where you heading, sweetheart?

528
00:32:24,144 --> 00:32:27,807
- On a secret voyage.
- Who are those people?

529
00:32:28,815 --> 00:32:30,077
A secret.

530
00:32:32,452 --> 00:32:36,013
Fine, then. It's you and Mom.
You're drifting out to sea.

531
00:32:37,891 --> 00:32:39,518
I'm not sure why I'm
taking this personally,

532
00:32:39,592 --> 00:32:42,117
but why are Reggie
and I drifting out to sea?

533
00:32:42,829 --> 00:32:44,797
You were kicked off the boat.

534
00:32:45,999 --> 00:32:48,024
Why can't I be on the boat?

535
00:32:48,968 --> 00:32:51,493
Georgia, what do you have to say?

536
00:32:51,938 --> 00:32:53,803
Better luck next life.

537
00:32:56,609 --> 00:32:58,804
Those are the words you're
gonna leave your little sister with?

538
00:32:58,878 --> 00:33:01,312
Who worships the ground you walk on?

539
00:33:06,619 --> 00:33:08,052
What are you doing, sweetie?

540
00:33:08,121 --> 00:33:10,555
I'm getting back on Georgia's boat.

541
00:33:20,967 --> 00:33:23,492
<i>My getaway plan
worked to perfection.</i>

542
00:33:23,903 --> 00:33:25,268
<i>Dead at 18.</i>

543
00:33:35,415 --> 00:33:37,940
Are his kidneys compromised, too, Doctor?

544
00:33:40,453 --> 00:33:42,478
Uh, that's what I'm here to find out.

545
00:33:45,658 --> 00:33:46,920
Poor kid.

546
00:33:47,427 --> 00:33:50,453
Quarterback turned vegetable.
It's a fate worse than death.

547
00:33:50,663 --> 00:33:52,130
Oh, I'll say.

548
00:33:57,337 --> 00:33:59,396
You'll thank me for this some day.

549
00:34:02,976 --> 00:34:04,204
<i>Or not.</i>

550
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:08,371
Die, goddamn it.

551
00:34:09,115 --> 00:34:10,480
<i>Did I say that out loud?</i>

552
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:14,919
Uh, don't die, Hudson.
Hudson, please don't die.

553
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:18,584
Don't... Oh, I need a tissue.

554
00:34:28,067 --> 00:34:29,967
Why are you here?

555
00:34:32,071 --> 00:34:37,509
- I just want to see Hudson.
- This is for friends and family only. Bye.

556
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:44,148
You didn't have
to be so rough on her.

557
00:34:44,217 --> 00:34:46,151
Hudson doesn't even know that girl.

558
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:47,379
You didn't have to
make her feel like shit.

559
00:34:47,453 --> 00:34:49,853
Yeah, well, this isn't about her.
It's about Hudson.

560
00:35:51,251 --> 00:35:52,684
10:15, Reggie.

561
00:35:54,621 --> 00:35:57,886
Lisa left work early,
so I had to close up by myself.

562
00:35:58,291 --> 00:36:01,260
Well, that sucks.
How did you get home, then?

563
00:36:01,928 --> 00:36:03,361
Bus.

564
00:36:03,963 --> 00:36:06,158
Honey, I would have picked you up.

565
00:36:06,699 --> 00:36:08,462
You've got your books.

566
00:36:09,269 --> 00:36:11,897
I didn't want to pull you away.

567
00:36:11,971 --> 00:36:14,337
Well, when did you
become so thoughtful?

568
00:36:19,579 --> 00:36:21,979
A boy at school almost died today.

569
00:36:22,515 --> 00:36:23,914
Hit and run.

570
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:25,815
Oh, my God!

571
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,478
He's in intensive care.

572
00:36:29,989 --> 00:36:31,616
Did you know him?

573
00:36:35,962 --> 00:36:38,556
- Ow.
- I'm sorry.

574
00:36:38,631 --> 00:36:43,500
Sorry. Um, the buckle on my
shirt just jabbed into my back.

575
00:36:47,573 --> 00:36:49,370
Red, but not bleeding.

576
00:36:49,442 --> 00:36:52,741
Yeah,
I hate this stupid thing.

577
00:36:53,379 --> 00:36:55,279
Now the buckle puts
holes into my back.

578
00:36:58,484 --> 00:37:01,180
Maybe you should take it off.

579
00:37:06,326 --> 00:37:07,850
Maybe I should.

580
00:37:09,862 --> 00:37:11,591
Unless you want to.

581
00:37:15,468 --> 00:37:16,730
Not really.

582
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:19,265
I mean, everybody knows him.

583
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:22,936
Hudson Hart. He plays football.

584
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,034
I love you.

585
00:37:26,913 --> 00:37:30,212
Does that mean that you're gonna
take me to the homecoming dance?

586
00:37:32,418 --> 00:37:34,943
Uh, I...

587
00:37:36,756 --> 00:37:38,246
I'm already...

588
00:37:38,658 --> 00:37:40,751
Chill.

589
00:37:41,194 --> 00:37:43,992
You know I wouldn't be
caught at that stupid dance.

590
00:37:44,063 --> 00:37:45,758
But you could still ask.

591
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:51,400
I know who you mean.
He goes out with that beautiful girl.

592
00:37:51,471 --> 00:37:53,234
Jennifer Hardek.

593
00:37:56,109 --> 00:37:58,509
Oh, guess it's too late
to call her parents.

594
00:37:59,645 --> 00:38:01,340
Why would you call her parents?

595
00:38:01,414 --> 00:38:02,779
Because I know them.

596
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:05,178
And it's what I do.

597
00:38:06,252 --> 00:38:10,245
Maybe I could help Jennifer.
She's gotta be really freaked out.

598
00:38:10,323 --> 00:38:12,188
Worried he's gonna die.

599
00:38:14,293 --> 00:38:15,760
Yeah.

600
00:38:18,064 --> 00:38:19,861
Reggie, are you upset?

601
00:38:22,368 --> 00:38:24,461
It's okay to cry, sweetheart.

602
00:38:25,738 --> 00:38:27,603
Death is scary, I know.

603
00:38:28,674 --> 00:38:30,869
Even if he wasn't your friend.

604
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:01,131
Mason.

605
00:39:02,074 --> 00:39:03,598
Mason, wake up.

606
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,007
Mason!

607
00:39:06,612 --> 00:39:10,013
Give me
one more kiss then, Tiffany.

608
00:39:10,616 --> 00:39:13,312
Ugh! Mason, pull yourself together.

609
00:39:15,087 --> 00:39:16,076
Goddamn it!

610
00:39:58,564 --> 00:40:00,259
- There you go. There you go.
- Holy shit.

611
00:40:01,434 --> 00:40:03,368
Right there! Right there!
Right there. Right there.

612
00:40:03,503 --> 00:40:04,902
Right there! Right there!

613
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:10,468
My reap is still alive,
my sister's in love with him,

614
00:40:10,543 --> 00:40:12,841
Daisy and Cameron
are having Tantric sex...

615
00:40:12,912 --> 00:40:15,210
And all is right with the world.

616
00:40:15,948 --> 00:40:18,109
This is like invasion
of the body snatchers.

617
00:40:18,184 --> 00:40:19,947
Roxy, snap out of it!

618
00:40:20,019 --> 00:40:21,418
I did.

619
00:40:21,487 --> 00:40:23,512
Then what do we do?
How do we fix this?

620
00:40:23,589 --> 00:40:25,716
We don't fix what isn't broken.

621
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:27,554
George, look around.

622
00:40:28,728 --> 00:40:30,457
Look at this place.

623
00:40:31,163 --> 00:40:33,154
Cameron's figured it out.

624
00:40:33,933 --> 00:40:35,298
Figured what out?

625
00:40:35,368 --> 00:40:38,531
That there's no bolt of
lightning coming down.

626
00:40:38,604 --> 00:40:39,901
What are you talking about?

627
00:40:39,972 --> 00:40:42,873
There are no consequences
for anything we do.

628
00:40:42,942 --> 00:40:46,708
Yes, there are.
Terrible ones. Rube said...

629
00:40:46,779 --> 00:40:48,269
I loved that man.

630
00:40:48,881 --> 00:40:52,282
But Rube is not here
anymore to make the rules.

631
00:40:52,351 --> 00:40:54,649
Well, then, you tell me what to do.

632
00:40:55,922 --> 00:40:59,119
Who knows how much time
we have left here, George.

633
00:40:59,926 --> 00:41:02,019
Make hay while the sun shines.

634
00:41:02,628 --> 00:41:04,892
With Cameron's blessings.

635
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,594
<i>Oh, great.
Now Roxy's flipped.</i>

636
00:41:11,003 --> 00:41:14,268
<i>Well, that makes it official.
The world's gone mad.</i>

637
00:41:14,974 --> 00:41:18,171
<i>When the world goes mad,
anything can happen.</i>

638
00:41:18,244 --> 00:41:19,871
<i>Like I get left in charge.</i>

639
00:41:19,946 --> 00:41:23,746
Visa card application? Says you
get a Seahawks helmet on the card.

640
00:41:23,816 --> 00:41:25,841
No. Oh, don't forget,

641
00:41:25,918 --> 00:41:28,785
the purchase orders get filed in
the second drawer, but only after...

642
00:41:28,854 --> 00:41:31,345
After they've been stapled
to the invoice. I know, Delores.

643
00:41:31,424 --> 00:41:34,359
It's only a few more
responsibilities until you're back.

644
00:41:34,694 --> 00:41:38,653
Oh. And if corporate calls,
remember, it's my Uncle Murray

645
00:41:38,731 --> 00:41:41,427
that had kidney failure.
Not too far from the truth.

646
00:41:43,069 --> 00:41:45,867
Aw, look at my big boy up there.

647
00:41:46,339 --> 00:41:48,637
Insists on jumping up to
the highest spot in the room

648
00:41:48,708 --> 00:41:52,041
when he doesn't have the strength
to clean his own bottom after a poo.

649
00:41:52,111 --> 00:41:53,271
You're a wonder.

650
00:41:54,647 --> 00:41:56,945
A dentist in our building.
$50 off teeth whitening.

651
00:41:57,016 --> 00:41:59,382
- No.
- It says they use a laser to do it

652
00:41:59,452 --> 00:42:00,783
and it's the next big thing.

653
00:42:00,853 --> 00:42:03,447
Yeah, my behind
is the next big thing.

654
00:42:05,524 --> 00:42:07,719
Burial at sea, taxidermy, cremation?

655
00:42:09,161 --> 00:42:10,185
Hey, give me that.

656
00:42:10,262 --> 00:42:11,251
Why?

657
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:14,163
I don't
want Murray to know.

658
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,661
What, you don't think
he knows he's dying?

659
00:42:16,736 --> 00:42:19,398
He'll be so busy living,
he won't even see it coming.

660
00:42:19,472 --> 00:42:20,803
And neither will I.

661
00:42:20,873 --> 00:42:22,966
Why? What are you two gonna do?

662
00:42:23,042 --> 00:42:24,441
Everything.

663
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:26,102
Get laid?

664
00:42:26,879 --> 00:42:28,847
I hear Ryan's available.

665
00:42:30,516 --> 00:42:32,245
Let me see that
teeth whitening thing.

666
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,181
<i>This is a first.</i>

667
00:42:37,089 --> 00:42:39,114
<i>I'm the responsible one.</i>

668
00:42:40,393 --> 00:42:42,759
<i>Where the hell is everyone?</i>

669
00:42:44,263 --> 00:42:45,525
<i>- When I was alive...
- Thank you.</i>

670
00:42:45,598 --> 00:42:48,226
<i>...I was never a defender
of following the rules.</i>

671
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:51,394
<i>Rule breakers were
usually considered kind of cool.</i>

672
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:54,735
<i>And I wanted to be cool,
so I broke a lot of rules.</i>

673
00:42:55,074 --> 00:42:58,009
<i>If I got caught,
I got punished. No big deal.</i>

674
00:42:58,077 --> 00:43:00,671
<i>In death, the rules are unclear.</i>

675
00:43:00,746 --> 00:43:04,079
<i>And if you break them,
the consequences are murkier.</i>

676
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:06,618
<i>As a reaper, we are
supposed to take souls</i>

677
00:43:06,686 --> 00:43:10,213
<i>and lead them to their lights,
but what if we don't?</i>

678
00:43:10,289 --> 00:43:13,520
<i>We aren't supposed to
interfere with the living world,</i>

679
00:43:13,592 --> 00:43:14,752
<i>but what if we do?</i>

680
00:43:14,827 --> 00:43:18,024
<i>What are the consequences
of breaking rules?</i>

681
00:43:18,097 --> 00:43:20,065
<i>Who knows,
until someone breaks them?</i>

682
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,167
Will she be getting
a medal, Commissioner Cusek?

683
00:43:30,242 --> 00:43:31,436
At least one.

684
00:43:33,012 --> 00:43:37,415
- Anything to add, Officer?
- I was just doing my job.

685
00:43:37,483 --> 00:43:39,974
Don't be modest.
Come on, give us the details.

686
00:43:40,052 --> 00:43:43,112
I was at the right place
at the right time.

687
00:43:47,526 --> 00:43:49,187
No, you don't. No, you don't!

688
00:43:49,328 --> 00:43:51,489
Get back in there!

689
00:43:52,765 --> 00:43:54,528
- Call 911!
Right away!

690
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,431
You are not gonna die on me.

691
00:43:56,502 --> 00:43:59,335
- You hear me?
- Let go of me, lady!

692
00:44:00,706 --> 00:44:02,003
Throw me back in the water!

693
00:44:03,275 --> 00:44:04,674
Witnesses say he looked dead

694
00:44:04,744 --> 00:44:07,212
but that you wouldn't
give up on the CPR.

695
00:44:07,279 --> 00:44:09,042
I might have cracked
a few ribs,

696
00:44:09,115 --> 00:44:12,414
but I just felt like
I could bring him back to life.

697
00:44:12,485 --> 00:44:13,474
Right here, Roxy.

698
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,694
Shit.

699
00:44:56,395 --> 00:44:58,488
- Hello.
- Hello.

700
00:44:58,564 --> 00:45:00,532
Are you Otto Zien?

701
00:45:01,066 --> 00:45:02,465
Yes. How did you know my name?

702
00:45:02,535 --> 00:45:05,231
I got friends in high places.

703
00:45:06,005 --> 00:45:08,599
On the floor, now! Down!

704
00:45:26,192 --> 00:45:28,592
Excuse me.
I think I'll take that.

705
00:45:33,899 --> 00:45:35,958
That really bloody hurt!

706
00:45:37,169 --> 00:45:39,399
You can't kill a dead guy, mate.

707
00:45:42,374 --> 00:45:43,841
Motherfucker!

708
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:45,534
Money.

709
00:45:52,051 --> 00:45:53,678
Thank you.

710
00:45:59,458 --> 00:46:00,891
<i>Hello.</i>

711
00:46:05,631 --> 00:46:08,031
Excuse me. Excuse me.

712
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:09,624
Excuse me.

713
00:46:09,702 --> 00:46:11,101
Excuse me.

714
00:46:13,639 --> 00:46:17,006
Clean hospital is a happy hospital.

715
00:46:37,396 --> 00:46:41,127
Well, it's such a short run, Daisy.
I want to do every performance.

716
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,633
Well, how about, um, you know,

717
00:46:42,701 --> 00:46:44,692
just a teensy, weensy
little Wednesday matinee?

718
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:47,136
You know, nothing but
a bunch of blue hairs.

719
00:46:47,206 --> 00:46:50,266
I don't think so. Sorry. No offense.

720
00:46:53,846 --> 00:46:55,211
None taken.

721
00:47:12,932 --> 00:47:14,627
And if we fail,

722
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:18,136
then screw
your courage to the sticking-post.

723
00:47:18,237 --> 00:47:20,831
It's "sticking-place. "

724
00:47:20,906 --> 00:47:23,602
That's what I said!

725
00:47:27,546 --> 00:47:29,036
How do I look?

726
00:47:29,748 --> 00:47:30,772
Deadly.

727
00:47:34,653 --> 00:47:36,086
I'm on.

728
00:47:40,826 --> 00:47:41,918
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

729
00:47:43,228 --> 00:47:45,162
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

730
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:46,959
No, I didn't!

731
00:47:47,032 --> 00:47:51,628
I specifically said
I wanted the report by 3:00!

732
00:47:51,704 --> 00:47:54,229
You did not. You said 5:00.

733
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:57,639
Amy! Just admit
that you fucked up!

734
00:47:58,744 --> 00:48:01,440
Delores would never
talk to anyone that way.

735
00:48:01,513 --> 00:48:03,981
Yeah? Well, maybe she should.

736
00:48:04,049 --> 00:48:07,507
Maybe it would make things run
a little more smoothly around here.

737
00:48:07,586 --> 00:48:09,178
I quit!

738
00:48:10,189 --> 00:48:11,850
Well, if I had known
it was gonna be that easy,

739
00:48:11,924 --> 00:48:14,654
I would have
yelled at you a lot sooner!

740
00:48:17,596 --> 00:48:19,894
What are you all looking at?

741
00:48:30,743 --> 00:48:33,871
<i>Geronimo!</i>

742
00:48:36,348 --> 00:48:38,407
<i>Let's go, Murray!</i>

743
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:43,711
<i>Talk about free-falling.</i>

744
00:48:43,789 --> 00:48:47,088
<i>While Delores and Murray were
free-falling through space,</i>

745
00:48:47,159 --> 00:48:49,184
<i>Daisy was just spaced out.</i>

746
00:48:49,261 --> 00:48:51,092
Out, damned spot.

747
00:48:53,832 --> 00:48:55,595
Out, damned spot?

748
00:48:56,735 --> 00:48:58,259
Out, I say.

749
00:49:00,706 --> 00:49:03,698
The thane of Fife had a wife.

750
00:49:05,144 --> 00:49:06,475
E- I-E-I-O.

751
00:49:10,949 --> 00:49:13,144
And a moo moo here,
and a moo moo there.

752
00:49:13,218 --> 00:49:15,083
Here a moo,
there a moo, everywhere a moo moo.

753
00:49:15,154 --> 00:49:18,146
<i>Old MacDonald had a farm
E- I-E-I-O</i>

754
00:49:24,897 --> 00:49:27,627
I'm Lady Macbeth!

755
00:49:31,804 --> 00:49:34,534
Baby, I'm hungry.
You promised me a lobster.

756
00:49:34,606 --> 00:49:36,574
Of course I'm gonna give you a lobster.

757
00:49:36,642 --> 00:49:40,703
All right, just wait one second.
She'll be out in a minute. Promise. Promise.

758
00:49:40,779 --> 00:49:45,148
- Do you like her more than us?
- No, I don't like her more than you.

759
00:49:45,217 --> 00:49:48,380
I love you. And I love you.

760
00:49:49,054 --> 00:49:52,581
And I especially love you,
you, and you, and you.

761
00:49:53,759 --> 00:49:55,226
Then let's eat.

762
00:49:55,294 --> 00:49:58,320
Not yet. All right? Not yet.

763
00:49:58,397 --> 00:50:01,457
So give us the money,
and we'll go by ourselves.

764
00:50:07,139 --> 00:50:10,631
Okay. Um, could you, um...

765
00:50:14,546 --> 00:50:16,776
All right. Uh, fine.

766
00:50:19,451 --> 00:50:22,511
- I'll catch up with you.
- No rush.

767
00:50:45,811 --> 00:50:47,176
- Daisy.
- Oh.

768
00:50:47,246 --> 00:50:48,713
Where's my goddamn limo?

769
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:49,940
Daisy?

770
00:50:50,415 --> 00:50:51,507
Want it?

771
00:50:52,584 --> 00:50:55,451
Uh, I think you were brilliant tonight.

772
00:50:56,555 --> 00:50:58,489
Oh, Mason, Mason.

773
00:51:00,125 --> 00:51:01,285
Here.

774
00:51:02,694 --> 00:51:04,127
You're a good boy.

775
00:51:04,196 --> 00:51:05,288
Um...

776
00:51:17,409 --> 00:51:19,206
Cameron!

777
00:51:19,278 --> 00:51:21,872
What did you do
with my fucking limo?

778
00:51:22,481 --> 00:51:26,042
Had to walk home from the theater.
It was humiliating.

779
00:51:26,118 --> 00:51:29,849
About as humiliating as your
performance tonight, apparently.

780
00:51:31,957 --> 00:51:33,151
Where are you going?

781
00:51:33,225 --> 00:51:35,557
Oh, I have to head to
New York overnight on business.

782
00:51:35,627 --> 00:51:37,219
What's her name?

783
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:39,720
Goldman Sachs.

784
00:51:40,499 --> 00:51:42,228
She prettier than me?

785
00:51:42,301 --> 00:51:44,235
And a lot richer,
with a lot less attitude.

786
00:51:44,303 --> 00:51:47,431
Oh, no wonder I have attitude.
You haven't fucked me in days.

787
00:51:47,506 --> 00:51:50,600
I decided it was bad judgment
on my part to fuck the employees.

788
00:51:50,676 --> 00:51:53,167
- I hate you.
- Of course you do, Daisy. I'm a man.

789
00:51:53,245 --> 00:51:56,146
Oh, you! You!

790
00:52:05,624 --> 00:52:08,650
I really have to do
something about my hair.

791
00:52:09,761 --> 00:52:10,921
Hello?

792
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:13,124
I'm here for Raul.

793
00:52:13,198 --> 00:52:17,828
Oh, hello, hello. Come. Come here.
Oh, I am so glad you came.

794
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:19,463
Come here. Oh, yes.

795
00:52:21,974 --> 00:52:25,535
I guess you are only client
left who has any balls, yes?

796
00:52:25,611 --> 00:52:26,635
Oh.

797
00:52:26,712 --> 00:52:27,770
Yeah.

798
00:52:27,846 --> 00:52:29,074
Here. Here.

799
00:52:29,147 --> 00:52:33,106
In case we need to,
uh, pay the toll. Yes?

800
00:52:33,185 --> 00:52:34,516
Oh.

801
00:52:43,428 --> 00:52:44,952
Coming through?

802
00:52:45,764 --> 00:52:47,891
Mr. Poltergeist?

803
00:52:47,966 --> 00:52:49,263
Yeah.

804
00:52:49,334 --> 00:52:51,302
We have the yellow ones.

805
00:52:53,238 --> 00:52:54,967
They're your favorite.

806
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,098
Hmm?

807
00:52:56,742 --> 00:52:58,141
Let us pass.

808
00:53:01,446 --> 00:53:05,280
Uh, how long has
this been happening?

809
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:07,284
- Oh, that we have been haunted?
- Mmm.

810
00:53:07,352 --> 00:53:10,515
Oh, ever since Zac bit the dust.

811
00:53:10,589 --> 00:53:11,681
Oh.

812
00:53:11,757 --> 00:53:16,592
Uh, yes. It, uh, you know,
it seems like it has been forever. Yes.

813
00:53:16,662 --> 00:53:19,153
Oh. Right.

814
00:53:20,299 --> 00:53:23,928
The driver was having
trouble breathing,

815
00:53:24,002 --> 00:53:25,902
and he slumped over,
and all of a sudden,

816
00:53:25,971 --> 00:53:27,666
we were upside down.

817
00:53:27,739 --> 00:53:29,536
Is he dead?

818
00:53:47,826 --> 00:53:50,920
<i>Sometimes
the consequences of breaking rules</i>

819
00:53:50,996 --> 00:53:54,488
<i>not only punish you,
but punish others.</i>

820
00:54:04,643 --> 00:54:06,167
Can I help you?

821
00:54:08,046 --> 00:54:10,173
I don't know what I want yet.

822
00:54:14,019 --> 00:54:15,543
Take your time.

823
00:54:22,928 --> 00:54:24,486
Okay. I'm going on break.

824
00:54:26,898 --> 00:54:28,365
Don't inhale.

825
00:54:29,034 --> 00:54:31,525
Have you
decided yet, ma'am?

826
00:54:33,472 --> 00:54:34,871
I really have no idea.

827
00:54:36,007 --> 00:54:38,771
Well, you've got your ice cream,
cup or cone, milkshakes,

828
00:54:38,844 --> 00:54:41,278
smoothies and lemonade.

829
00:54:41,446 --> 00:54:42,970
What do you like?

830
00:54:43,682 --> 00:54:45,547
Just the lemonade.

831
00:54:45,617 --> 00:54:48,142
Lemonade it is. No ice.

832
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:49,448
$2.50.

833
00:54:50,288 --> 00:54:56,659
In ninth grade, I knew this kid, Marty Oben,
who ate eight banana splits in one sitting.

834
00:54:58,029 --> 00:55:00,293
Not a pretty sight.

835
00:55:00,365 --> 00:55:02,663
I think I heard that story once.

836
00:55:04,569 --> 00:55:06,799
It's sad about this kid, Hudson.

837
00:55:06,872 --> 00:55:07,930
Did you know him?

838
00:55:08,006 --> 00:55:10,031
Yeah, we go to the same high school.

839
00:55:10,108 --> 00:55:11,973
Oh, so you're buddies?

840
00:55:12,978 --> 00:55:14,809
Kind of.

841
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,643
What kind of buddies?

842
00:55:17,883 --> 00:55:20,317
- Um...
- Oh, that kind.

843
00:55:21,219 --> 00:55:24,052
- Don't tell anyone.
- Why? No one knows?

844
00:55:24,222 --> 00:55:26,315
I don't have any friends.

845
00:55:26,792 --> 00:55:29,454
Well, then you should be
at the hospital with him.

846
00:55:29,528 --> 00:55:34,625
I tried. Didn't really go so well.
His real girlfriend gave me the boot.

847
00:55:37,369 --> 00:55:41,635
Well, what if he dies and
you never get to say goodbye?

848
00:55:42,908 --> 00:55:45,433
You'd have to live with that forever.

849
00:55:46,711 --> 00:55:48,235
I'm used to it.

850
00:55:48,914 --> 00:55:53,283
Don't let his friends give you shit.
Don't be a wuss. Tell 'em to fuck off.

851
00:55:53,351 --> 00:55:55,581
It's not that. It's just that

852
00:55:56,721 --> 00:55:59,622
I don't want them
to think of him that way.

853
00:55:59,691 --> 00:56:01,921
That he would be
with someone like me.

854
00:56:01,993 --> 00:56:06,430
If he dies, then I don't need to
mess up their idea of who he was.

855
00:56:06,731 --> 00:56:08,824
If he lives, then whatever.

856
00:56:10,035 --> 00:56:11,195
Shit.

857
00:56:12,437 --> 00:56:13,802
I gotta go.

858
00:56:18,310 --> 00:56:20,403
What's that for?

859
00:56:20,512 --> 00:56:21,536
Cab money.

860
00:56:21,613 --> 00:56:24,104
To get to the hospital. On me.

861
00:56:25,817 --> 00:56:27,114
Thanks.

862
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:37,821
Can't you give him
something for the pain, please?

863
00:56:37,896 --> 00:56:39,386
- We've given him all we can.
- It's not working.

864
00:56:39,464 --> 00:56:41,125
He's in agony. Please.

865
00:56:41,199 --> 00:56:42,359
Shit.

866
00:56:42,434 --> 00:56:44,664
<i>Nursing supervisor to seven west.</i>

867
00:56:44,736 --> 00:56:46,135
Oh, sorry.

868
00:56:46,204 --> 00:56:49,002
<i>Nursing supervisor
to seven west.</i>

869
00:56:53,078 --> 00:56:55,512
Who the fuck are you,
and why do you keep following me?

870
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:57,411
Look, it's complicated.

871
00:56:57,482 --> 00:56:59,211
I've got time.

872
00:56:59,951 --> 00:57:03,011
This is a really bad idea,
you riding with me.

873
00:57:03,455 --> 00:57:06,288
- I could jump out.
- What, are you crazy?

874
00:57:06,358 --> 00:57:08,758
- Okay!
- Tell me who you are, or I'm out of here.

875
00:57:08,827 --> 00:57:12,888
Okay! Okay! I'm George Lass.

876
00:57:12,964 --> 00:57:15,398
- That's not funny.
- All right, when you were three,

877
00:57:15,467 --> 00:57:17,662
I knocked your front teeth out
with a croquet ball.

878
00:57:17,736 --> 00:57:20,705
When you were seven,
I burned your Barbie dolls.

879
00:57:20,772 --> 00:57:22,535
When you were 10,

880
00:57:23,408 --> 00:57:25,433
I swore I'd never talk to you again,

881
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:28,775
and when I was 18,
I kept that promise.

882
00:57:34,953 --> 00:57:36,511
I think I'm gonna puke.

883
00:57:36,588 --> 00:57:39,716
Do it out the window.
I just detailed the car.

884
00:57:54,406 --> 00:57:55,998
Sorry I sprayed on you.

885
00:57:56,074 --> 00:57:58,167
Ah, these shoes suck anyway.

886
00:57:58,643 --> 00:58:01,942
- Do not. They're cool.
- What size are you?

887
00:58:02,013 --> 00:58:05,176
- Eight, eight and a half.
- They're yours.

888
00:58:07,152 --> 00:58:09,950
In elementary school, Mom made
me wear your hand-me-downs.

889
00:58:10,021 --> 00:58:13,184
That's right. Every time
she would go into the attic,

890
00:58:13,258 --> 00:58:15,954
you knew what
she was coming down with.

891
00:58:16,027 --> 00:58:17,995
A box of my old shit.

892
00:58:18,763 --> 00:58:20,993
I hated them. But...

893
00:58:21,066 --> 00:58:22,829
You don't have to take them
if you don't want them.

894
00:58:22,901 --> 00:58:23,993
I don't care.

895
00:58:24,069 --> 00:58:27,232
But when you died,
she didn't give me your stuff anymore,

896
00:58:27,305 --> 00:58:29,136
even when I begged her.

897
00:58:29,207 --> 00:58:32,472
You know, I got a nice pair of fuck-me
pumps back at home if you want them.

898
00:58:33,645 --> 00:58:35,135
They kind of squish my baby toe.

899
00:58:35,213 --> 00:58:37,238
Mom would be so pissed.

900
00:58:37,315 --> 00:58:39,579
It's against the rules
in her grieving book.

901
00:58:39,651 --> 00:58:43,678
Yeah, never let your living kid
wear your dead kid's stilettos.

902
00:58:44,222 --> 00:58:45,712
Word for word.

903
00:58:46,725 --> 00:58:49,023
That's cool, Mom wrote a book.

904
00:58:49,094 --> 00:58:51,892
I don't think she really had a choice.

905
00:58:51,963 --> 00:58:54,193
It was either that, or go crazy.

906
00:58:56,167 --> 00:58:57,691
What about you?

907
00:58:58,637 --> 00:59:01,367
Think it's pretty obvious
what choice I made.

908
00:59:01,439 --> 00:59:03,407
You're not crazy, Reggie.

909
00:59:05,844 --> 00:59:07,937
And you're not real, George.

910
00:59:09,614 --> 00:59:13,778
<i>And there I was,
haunted by Rube's mantra.</i>

911
00:59:13,852 --> 00:59:16,286
<i>I couldn't have it both ways.</i>

912
00:59:16,354 --> 00:59:19,380
<i>If Reggie was going to
get her dead sister back,</i>

913
00:59:19,457 --> 00:59:22,551
<i>she would have to let go
of her grip on reality.</i>

914
00:59:44,382 --> 00:59:48,341
Delores, what happened?
Is Murray dead?

915
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:49,682
No.

916
00:59:50,989 --> 00:59:55,426
No. Amy is suing
Happy Time for harassment.

917
00:59:58,029 --> 01:00:00,793
- Why?
- Well, that's what I'm here to ask you.

918
01:00:01,332 --> 01:00:02,492
Legal called me on my cell

919
01:00:02,567 --> 01:00:04,535
when Murray and I were
halfway up Mount St. Helens.

920
01:00:04,602 --> 01:00:08,629
Oh, Delores, I'm sorry.

921
01:00:09,908 --> 01:00:11,773
I trusted you, Millie.

922
01:00:13,111 --> 01:00:14,874
And you let me down.

923
01:00:16,681 --> 01:00:20,947
So, until this matter is resolved,
I have no choice but to let you go.

924
01:00:23,288 --> 01:00:25,085
Millie, you're fired.

925
01:00:26,024 --> 01:00:27,389
Surprise.

926
01:00:29,127 --> 01:00:30,526
Who is this?

927
01:00:31,830 --> 01:00:32,922
I don't know.

928
01:00:32,997 --> 01:00:34,055
Just because you're dead

929
01:00:34,132 --> 01:00:35,827
doesn't mean that
I can't move in with you.

930
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:38,198
And just because
I'm dead doesn't mean I can't have

931
01:00:38,269 --> 01:00:39,736
a splitting headache.

932
01:00:39,804 --> 01:00:41,396
Come on, George.

933
01:00:42,107 --> 01:00:44,234
Reggie,
you have to go home.

934
01:00:44,609 --> 01:00:46,600
For Christ sakes, you're 16!

935
01:00:47,579 --> 01:00:49,547
You have your whole life
ahead of you. Go home.

936
01:00:49,614 --> 01:00:52,412
No! I can't talk to Mom.

937
01:00:52,884 --> 01:00:56,479
Well, that's one thing you and
I will always have in common.

938
01:00:57,522 --> 01:00:59,422
So, talk to the old man.

939
01:00:59,491 --> 01:01:02,119
Dad moved. He has a new family.

940
01:01:02,894 --> 01:01:04,088
Reggie.

941
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:07,391
I'm a grim reaper.

942
01:01:08,299 --> 01:01:12,030
I'm way past
slumber parties and pillow fights.

943
01:01:12,103 --> 01:01:15,129
- You wouldn't be happy.
- I'm not 11 anymore.

944
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:18,934
And I've lived the past
five years without you.

945
01:01:19,778 --> 01:01:22,679
I guess I don't really
need you now, either.

946
01:01:27,152 --> 01:01:28,744
You're right.

947
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:31,948
I never really did anything
nice for you when I was alive.

948
01:01:32,023 --> 01:01:33,684
Why would you
think I would now?

949
01:01:33,758 --> 01:01:37,023
- Because you owe me.
- Nice try.

950
01:01:39,764 --> 01:01:41,732
Because you love me.

951
01:01:51,042 --> 01:01:52,134
Okay.

952
01:01:53,812 --> 01:01:55,211
Can I drive?

953
01:01:56,047 --> 01:01:57,275
Yeah, why not?

954
01:02:00,919 --> 01:02:02,716
Where the hell is George?

955
01:02:03,888 --> 01:02:04,912
Having texting issues.

956
01:02:04,989 --> 01:02:06,354
I am, too.

957
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:10,487
Fucking Cameron!

958
01:02:11,863 --> 01:02:13,455
We can't blame
the man for everything.

959
01:02:13,531 --> 01:02:16,500
It's not like we didn't
buy into this bullshit.

960
01:02:16,568 --> 01:02:18,399
Yeah, well, the fish
stinks from the head.

961
01:02:18,469 --> 01:02:20,130
And all the dead bodies.

962
01:02:20,205 --> 01:02:22,139
So, what are we gonna
do about it, then?

963
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:24,675
Go above his head.
Upper management.

964
01:02:24,742 --> 01:02:28,200
Do you want to talk into
the microphone any louder, Roxy?

965
01:02:28,279 --> 01:02:30,179
You're paranoid, moron.

966
01:02:32,016 --> 01:02:33,608
W- W-R-D?

967
01:02:33,685 --> 01:02:36,381
Oh, I love that show.

968
01:02:36,487 --> 01:02:37,681
That Loni Anderson.

969
01:02:37,755 --> 01:02:40,781
What a beautiful pair
of boom-booms she had.

970
01:02:40,859 --> 01:02:42,793
What would Rube do? You stupid idiot.

971
01:02:42,861 --> 01:02:44,988
Oh, yeah.
What would Rube...

972
01:02:45,063 --> 01:02:48,123
Yeah, that's good. Well, first
of all, he'd probably eat a pie.

973
01:02:48,199 --> 01:02:51,066
Then he'd slurpy slurp
his coffee really loudly.

974
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:53,035
Then he'd abuse me
in some way or another.

975
01:02:53,104 --> 01:02:57,700
Then he'd figure out a way
to kick Cameron's little ass.

976
01:02:57,775 --> 01:03:01,267
This is only gonna get worse.
Do you understand this?

977
01:03:01,346 --> 01:03:02,677
Ugh.

978
01:03:02,747 --> 01:03:03,873
Not

979
01:03:04,983 --> 01:03:06,883
if we don't let it.

980
01:03:08,152 --> 01:03:10,484
All right. Let's make this quick.

981
01:03:11,389 --> 01:03:14,187
I've got a hedge fund
meeting in Hong Kong.

982
01:03:14,392 --> 01:03:16,883
Always had a weakness for
volatility, risk and easy women.

983
01:03:16,961 --> 01:03:19,088
- What about our reaps?
- What about them?

984
01:03:19,163 --> 01:03:20,892
You can't just
leave us hanging.

985
01:03:20,965 --> 01:03:22,933
- Rube wouldn't do that.
- Rube was a fucking idiot.

986
01:03:23,001 --> 01:03:24,161
And the way you losers bought into

987
01:03:24,235 --> 01:03:26,032
his fire and brimstone
bullshit is beyond me.

988
01:03:26,104 --> 01:03:28,868
- Oh, fuck you, Cameron.
- No, thanks, Daisy.

989
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:31,465
I've been there, and I've done that.

990
01:03:31,542 --> 01:03:35,945
Although I do agree with Rube on
the old cause-and-effect chaos theory.

991
01:03:36,981 --> 01:03:39,472
You drop a pebble in the ocean,
creating a tiny wave,

992
01:03:39,550 --> 01:03:41,916
eventually it turns into a tsunami

993
01:03:41,986 --> 01:03:45,615
ripping through Indonesia,
killing thousands.

994
01:03:46,457 --> 01:03:47,685
Or not.

995
01:03:48,459 --> 01:03:51,121
Perhaps a drunken performance,

996
01:03:51,729 --> 01:03:53,390
a moronic liquor-store robbery,

997
01:03:53,464 --> 01:03:56,922
a selfish heroic act, a delayed reap,

998
01:03:57,902 --> 01:04:00,234
can create genocide in the Sudan.

999
01:04:01,773 --> 01:04:04,264
And you, my friends,

1000
01:04:05,743 --> 01:04:07,540
were the pebbles.

1001
01:04:07,612 --> 01:04:10,672
I dropped you in, and one by one,
you fucked up,

1002
01:04:11,015 --> 01:04:13,347
creating a wave which, frankly,

1003
01:04:14,452 --> 01:04:15,885
I'm too bored to ride.

1004
01:04:15,954 --> 01:04:18,252
So this is just a game to you?

1005
01:04:18,323 --> 01:04:19,654
Oh, we're all players.

1006
01:04:19,724 --> 01:04:21,089
You're evil!

1007
01:04:21,159 --> 01:04:23,684
Yeah, I must admit I'm getting
a little bit fed up with you,

1008
01:04:23,761 --> 01:04:25,194
you little prick.

1009
01:04:25,263 --> 01:04:29,996
You, Mason, are a sad, sad little clown.

1010
01:04:30,068 --> 01:04:32,036
Watch it.
- Ooh, scary words

1011
01:04:32,103 --> 01:04:33,798
from the passive-aggressive
ex-meter maid.

1012
01:04:33,871 --> 01:04:36,431
There's nothing passive
with my aggression.

1013
01:04:38,943 --> 01:04:40,376
Asshole.

1014
01:04:41,012 --> 01:04:43,037
- We have to get rid of him.
- Yeah. Yeah, we have to get rid of him.

1015
01:04:43,114 --> 01:04:44,342
We have to kill him.

1016
01:04:44,415 --> 01:04:45,677
- Let's kill him. Let's kill him.
- Kill him?

1017
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:47,445
How do you kill
someone who's already dead?

1018
01:04:47,518 --> 01:04:49,383
I don't know. How do you kill
somebody who's already dead?

1019
01:04:49,454 --> 01:04:51,012
How do...
How do...

1020
01:04:51,823 --> 01:04:52,847
I'm thinking.

1021
01:05:10,541 --> 01:05:12,839
I'm dead, and I was frightened.

1022
01:05:13,611 --> 01:05:14,976
Do you think we should leave a note?

1023
01:05:15,046 --> 01:05:19,176
No way. Part of being dead
is having a very high deductible.

1024
01:05:24,689 --> 01:05:26,919
Are you sure you wanna do this?

1025
01:05:29,827 --> 01:05:30,919
Yeah.

1026
01:05:32,330 --> 01:05:34,298
And if Jennifer doesn't like it,
she can blow me.

1027
01:05:39,237 --> 01:05:40,431
Uh, hi.

1028
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:43,468
Um, you don't know me...

1029
01:05:43,541 --> 01:05:44,599
Reg?

1030
01:05:46,577 --> 01:05:47,908
Reggie Lass.

1031
01:05:49,514 --> 01:05:51,448
- This is my sister.
- Millie.

1032
01:05:51,516 --> 01:05:52,642
I'm not really her sister.

1033
01:05:52,717 --> 01:05:55,151
I'm part of the Big Sister program.
We mentor.

1034
01:05:55,219 --> 01:05:56,811
He asked for you.

1035
01:05:57,722 --> 01:05:59,747
- He did?
- Last night.

1036
01:05:59,824 --> 01:06:01,951
He talked. A couple of words.

1037
01:06:02,493 --> 01:06:05,462
We thought Reg would be a boy.

1038
01:06:05,530 --> 01:06:08,090
But the way he said your name,

1039
01:06:08,166 --> 01:06:11,465
well, it was pretty clear
that you were a girl.

1040
01:06:13,704 --> 01:06:15,103
Sorry.

1041
01:06:17,075 --> 01:06:20,272
We'll just step outside
and give you some privacy.

1042
01:06:20,611 --> 01:06:22,078
Stay close.

1043
01:06:22,146 --> 01:06:24,239
I mean, in case he wakes up.

1044
01:06:25,116 --> 01:06:27,141
Talk to him. Hold his hand.

1045
01:06:27,785 --> 01:06:29,150
Yes, ma'am.

1046
01:06:39,664 --> 01:06:41,359
I'm sorry, Hudson.

1047
01:06:42,867 --> 01:06:46,325
I never should have let them
keep me away from you.

1048
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:49,932
Reggie, I have to do my job.

1049
01:06:51,909 --> 01:06:53,672
You're not doing it.

1050
01:06:54,879 --> 01:06:56,540
I have to, Reggie.

1051
01:06:58,349 --> 01:07:00,681
But he asked his parents for me.

1052
01:07:00,751 --> 01:07:02,582
He asked for me, George.

1053
01:07:02,653 --> 01:07:03,847
I know.

1054
01:07:05,590 --> 01:07:07,649
He can't die.

1055
01:07:08,259 --> 01:07:10,318
Please don't take him away from me.

1056
01:07:10,394 --> 01:07:11,588
Please.

1057
01:07:12,930 --> 01:07:15,023
I have no choice, Reggie.

1058
01:07:15,099 --> 01:07:17,124
But I love him.

1059
01:07:33,151 --> 01:07:34,778
Reggie, I'm sorry.

1060
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:39,050
What happened? Is Reggie okay?

1061
01:07:39,123 --> 01:07:40,920
I don't know.

1062
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:54,802
His heart.

1063
01:07:57,041 --> 01:07:58,406
Oh, my God.

1064
01:08:18,863 --> 01:08:19,955
Clear.

1065
01:08:20,031 --> 01:08:21,658
Where did she go?

1066
01:08:22,366 --> 01:08:24,459
Where you can't follow.

1067
01:08:24,735 --> 01:08:26,100
Bullshit.

1068
01:08:28,906 --> 01:08:29,895
Clear.

1069
01:08:31,142 --> 01:08:32,404
Wait.

1070
01:08:35,046 --> 01:08:36,638
I've gotta find her.

1071
01:08:36,714 --> 01:08:41,481
Trust me, this won't turn out
well for either one of you.

1072
01:08:43,421 --> 01:08:44,945
I love her.

1073
01:08:46,390 --> 01:08:47,584
I know.

1074
01:09:01,072 --> 01:09:02,334
Tell her...

1075
01:09:02,406 --> 01:09:05,432
Tell her that I'm sorry
I kept her a secret.

1076
01:09:05,509 --> 01:09:06,874
I will.

1077
01:09:07,945 --> 01:09:10,937
Hudson, Hudson, Hudson...

1078
01:09:30,401 --> 01:09:32,096
Reggie, wait! Wait!

1079
01:09:49,487 --> 01:09:51,079
Are you okay?

1080
01:09:51,155 --> 01:09:52,247
I'm fine.

1081
01:09:52,323 --> 01:09:54,985
Then why are we going
85 miles an hour?

1082
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:58,724
Because you're dead,
Hudson's dead...

1083
01:09:58,796 --> 01:10:01,959
But, Reggie, you have your
whole life ahead of you.

1084
01:10:02,033 --> 01:10:04,558
It sounds like a line
of Mom's bullshit.

1085
01:10:07,371 --> 01:10:09,396
You're right.
But if you're gonna die,

1086
01:10:09,473 --> 01:10:11,441
you're not gonna
do it at this speed.

1087
01:10:14,078 --> 01:10:15,909
Whoo!

1088
01:10:15,980 --> 01:10:18,608
Yeah! Look what
this baby can do!

1089
01:10:18,683 --> 01:10:20,583
You know what? I'm on your side.

1090
01:10:20,651 --> 01:10:22,516
Let's try to hit 120.

1091
01:10:25,323 --> 01:10:26,847
Stop it. You're hurting my foot.

1092
01:10:26,924 --> 01:10:29,950
Oh, you have no idea.
You've never been reaped.

1093
01:10:30,027 --> 01:10:31,324
Well, you see that wall out there?

1094
01:10:31,395 --> 01:10:34,159
When you hit it, it's gonna
really hurt, so be ready for that.

1095
01:10:34,231 --> 01:10:37,029
- Stop it!
- This is gonna get really messy.

1096
01:10:37,101 --> 01:10:39,069
Stop it! We're gonna crash!

1097
01:10:39,136 --> 01:10:40,330
Oh, I thought that's
what you wanted.

1098
01:10:40,404 --> 01:10:42,031
I don't want to die!

1099
01:11:00,758 --> 01:11:02,487
Take it from me,

1100
01:11:03,694 --> 01:11:07,221
you're gonna die eventually,
so why speed up the process?

1101
01:11:07,832 --> 01:11:09,231
Thanks a lot.

1102
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:11,131
What I'm saying is

1103
01:11:13,304 --> 01:11:16,740
it's none of my business
when or how you die.

1104
01:11:17,341 --> 01:11:18,831
But know that
it is gonna happen,

1105
01:11:18,909 --> 01:11:21,400
and until then,
you have a lot to do.

1106
01:11:22,747 --> 01:11:26,046
Be adventurous, but not reckless.

1107
01:11:26,117 --> 01:11:27,948
You sound like Mom.

1108
01:11:28,018 --> 01:11:31,818
Fall in love again,
but not with some dickhead.

1109
01:11:32,890 --> 01:11:35,358
Stay in school. Have a big career.

1110
01:11:36,594 --> 01:11:39,222
Get married. Have a lot of kids.

1111
01:11:40,131 --> 01:11:42,964
Come 90 years old,
then a crazy old lady.

1112
01:11:44,135 --> 01:11:47,298
And scare the shit out
of the kids on Halloween.

1113
01:11:47,905 --> 01:11:49,805
It's hard to imagine.

1114
01:11:51,275 --> 01:11:52,640
Not for me.

1115
01:11:58,649 --> 01:11:59,980
Reggie,

1116
01:12:00,818 --> 01:12:02,786
I can't see you anymore.

1117
01:12:04,255 --> 01:12:05,745
I know.

1118
01:12:08,993 --> 01:12:12,053
I'm just tired of keeping so many secrets.

1119
01:12:14,298 --> 01:12:15,663
Then don't.

1120
01:12:21,305 --> 01:12:22,738
I love you.

1121
01:12:25,009 --> 01:12:27,705
Now you really sound like Mom.

1122
01:12:29,947 --> 01:12:31,915
<i>When I was a little girl,</i>

1123
01:12:31,982 --> 01:12:34,314
<i>I thought there was
a clock in my heart.</i>

1124
01:12:34,385 --> 01:12:36,615
<i>That it had these little hands.</i>

1125
01:12:38,556 --> 01:12:42,048
<i>I wish someone had told me
how easily those hands were broken,</i>

1126
01:12:42,126 --> 01:12:44,321
<i>how quickly the clock would stop.</i>

1127
01:12:45,496 --> 01:12:48,294
<i>I wouldn't have pretended
I was invisible.</i>

1128
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,535
<i>I would have paid
more attention to people.</i>

1129
01:12:52,870 --> 01:12:54,098
<i>To time.</i>

1130
01:12:56,507 --> 01:12:59,567
<i>I would have paid more
attention to everything.</i>

1131
01:13:05,049 --> 01:13:08,075
If you think I'm going gently to that
good night, then go fuck yourself!

1132
01:13:13,257 --> 01:13:16,385
Ain't nothing gentle
about this, asshole.

1133
01:13:23,033 --> 01:13:26,298
I thought silver bullets
were meant for werewolves.

1134
01:13:27,771 --> 01:13:29,102
What now?

1135
01:13:29,607 --> 01:13:31,268
I'm thinking.

1136
01:13:31,342 --> 01:13:33,936
How long's it been?
About one bottle's worth.

1137
01:13:34,011 --> 01:13:35,410
Top me off then, darling, will you?

1138
01:13:35,479 --> 01:13:37,106
Think he's gone?

1139
01:13:39,550 --> 01:13:41,313
Christ, this is getting boring.

1140
01:13:45,789 --> 01:13:48,781
What now?
- I'm thinking.

1141
01:13:51,395 --> 01:13:53,863
- I'm not convinced.
- Neither am I.

1142
01:13:53,931 --> 01:13:54,955
Neither am I.

1143
01:13:55,032 --> 01:13:57,262
Guys, can we stop
fucking around now?

1144
01:14:01,272 --> 01:14:02,705
Was she upset?

1145
01:14:02,773 --> 01:14:04,331
I don't know.

1146
01:14:04,408 --> 01:14:05,636
I mean, I don't think so.

1147
01:14:05,709 --> 01:14:08,007
You know, Reggie's pretty stoic.

1148
01:14:09,380 --> 01:14:12,008
Except she was upset
about this boy at school.

1149
01:14:12,082 --> 01:14:14,312
He'd... He'd had a bad accident.

1150
01:14:17,421 --> 01:14:19,082
You're an idiot.

1151
01:14:19,156 --> 01:14:20,487
Excuse me?

1152
01:14:21,692 --> 01:14:23,956
Not you. Me.

1153
01:14:53,557 --> 01:14:57,584
Murray, now you get to play
with Shadow and Snowball.

1154
01:14:58,495 --> 01:15:01,464
And JD and Junior.

1155
01:15:01,565 --> 01:15:06,025
Oh, and that meanie Stella.
Give her a swat for me, will you?

1156
01:15:06,570 --> 01:15:08,561
Meanest cat I ever had.

1157
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:13,232
Will you come with me
to dispose of the ashes?

1158
01:15:14,211 --> 01:15:16,236
Anything you need, Delores.

1159
01:15:32,396 --> 01:15:33,624
Morning.

1160
01:15:34,264 --> 01:15:35,322
Hey.

1161
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:39,833
You are so consistently inconsistent.

1162
01:15:40,104 --> 01:15:43,096
Actually, I'm just the opposite.

1163
01:15:44,274 --> 01:15:47,437
Well, either way,

1164
01:15:48,479 --> 01:15:50,640
you always end up here.

1165
01:15:51,315 --> 01:15:54,375
Would have been
considerate if you'd left a note.

1166
01:15:54,451 --> 01:15:57,011
I don't think you do that
when you run away.

1167
01:15:57,087 --> 01:15:58,850
Is that what this is?

1168
01:16:01,058 --> 01:16:02,525
Maybe.

1169
01:16:07,498 --> 01:16:08,863
Five years.

1170
01:16:10,034 --> 01:16:11,433
Like a blur.

1171
01:16:13,604 --> 01:16:15,162
Not for me.

1172
01:16:16,874 --> 01:16:20,674
And what exactly are these annual
maintenance fees used for, huh?

1173
01:16:23,414 --> 01:16:25,814
I'm never coming back here again.

1174
01:16:25,883 --> 01:16:27,077
Reggie.

1175
01:16:27,584 --> 01:16:29,916
Come on, it's your sister's grave.

1176
01:16:30,654 --> 01:16:32,781
Except George isn't in it.

1177
01:16:35,659 --> 01:16:38,059
I always knew that she was around.

1178
01:16:38,762 --> 01:16:41,925
And yesterday I met her.

1179
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:44,794
Really?

1180
01:16:45,269 --> 01:16:46,668
Yeah.

1181
01:16:46,737 --> 01:16:50,730
Except her name was Millie,
and she's a grim reaper

1182
01:16:50,808 --> 01:16:52,571
who works at Happy Time
and who takes people's souls

1183
01:16:52,643 --> 01:16:54,270
before they die.

1184
01:16:55,379 --> 01:16:57,142
So, this is about the boy.

1185
01:16:58,382 --> 01:17:00,373
Look, I have a picture.

1186
01:17:03,454 --> 01:17:06,548
- That isn't George.
- That's because it's Millie.

1187
01:17:06,623 --> 01:17:09,114
You'd like her.
She's nicer than George.

1188
01:17:09,193 --> 01:17:11,855
- Stop it.
- I'm not crazy!

1189
01:17:15,733 --> 01:17:19,191
God, I can't stay here any longer.

1190
01:17:19,269 --> 01:17:21,703
Do you think I'm a fan of cemeteries?

1191
01:17:21,772 --> 01:17:25,731
You say in your book that the
hardest part of grieving is letting go.

1192
01:17:26,577 --> 01:17:30,206
This town is death for the both of us.

1193
01:17:32,583 --> 01:17:35,381
I think you're having a nervous breakdown.

1194
01:17:37,154 --> 01:17:39,281
Can I have it in California?

1195
01:17:41,325 --> 01:17:42,519
What?

1196
01:17:47,664 --> 01:17:49,632
I'm sorry I grabbed you.

1197
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:51,031
It's okay.

1198
01:17:54,438 --> 01:17:56,838
Maybe we should take a vacation.

1199
01:17:58,275 --> 01:17:59,674
A road trip.

1200
01:18:01,912 --> 01:18:07,350
- As long as we share the driving.
- Okay, now I know you're crazy.

1201
01:18:12,456 --> 01:18:15,584
Why did you guys tell me Cameron
wanted chocolate and graham crackers?

1202
01:18:15,659 --> 01:18:18,719
Because he already
had marshmallows.

1203
01:18:20,430 --> 01:18:24,264
- What did I miss?
- Cameron's farewell party.

1204
01:18:25,502 --> 01:18:29,199
Oh, Mason, be a dear and
throw another leg on the fire.

1205
01:18:36,613 --> 01:18:38,240
He's finished now.

1206
01:18:38,315 --> 01:18:39,942
He's gotta be.

1207
01:18:41,185 --> 01:18:43,176
We can't do anything else.

1208
01:18:45,722 --> 01:18:47,314
Oh, yes, we can.

1209
01:18:56,066 --> 01:18:57,795
Who would have
thought such a small creature

1210
01:18:57,868 --> 01:19:00,098
could fill something this size?

1211
01:19:00,704 --> 01:19:02,467
Well, Murray had a big heart.

1212
01:19:02,539 --> 01:19:04,336
<i>And Cameron was a big ass.</i>

1213
01:19:04,408 --> 01:19:07,866
Silver-plated? Oh, Millie.

1214
01:19:08,278 --> 01:19:11,111
This must have set you
back a pretty penny.

1215
01:19:11,582 --> 01:19:13,140
A whole unemployment check.

1216
01:19:14,418 --> 01:19:16,215
I'm so sorry about all of that.

1217
01:19:16,286 --> 01:19:18,948
No apologies necessary.
It was my fault.

1218
01:19:19,022 --> 01:19:21,547
- Poor judgment.
- You're only human.

1219
01:19:22,426 --> 01:19:24,587
- You think?
- As is Amy.

1220
01:19:24,661 --> 01:19:26,959
Legal got back to me
about her lawsuit.

1221
01:19:27,030 --> 01:19:28,725
Turns out she's pulled this stunt

1222
01:19:28,799 --> 01:19:32,758
in the workplace before,
litigious little weasel.

1223
01:19:32,836 --> 01:19:36,203
- So I'm back?
- If you can forgive me.

1224
01:19:36,273 --> 01:19:38,901
- Corner office.
- Done.

1225
01:19:41,178 --> 01:19:42,805
This is Murray Herbig.

1226
01:19:43,914 --> 01:19:46,644
<i>"'My dear, sweet Murray,</i>

1227

1252
01:21:22,245 --> 01:21:24,145
So, who's in charge now?

1253
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:28,081
Have to wait to hear
from upper management.

1254
01:21:28,318 --> 01:21:29,751
What should we do?

1255
