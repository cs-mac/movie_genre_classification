1
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:34,950
I AM LOVE

2
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,635
Madam, your son told me
he is bringing a guest.

3
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:02,139
- A guest?
- Yes. A girl...

4
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,989
So, we have Gratieni
and his wife here,

5
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:22,242
Betta and Gregorio--

6
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:27,206
probably... here.

7
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,710
- Between Edo and Delfina.
- Yes.

8
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:35,005
She should sit next to Edoardo.

9
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,257
She doesn't know anyone.

10
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:45,515
- ls Edo back?
- Not yet.

11
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:50,979
- Any news on the race?
- He came in second.

12
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,648
Second?

13
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:56,276
The snow, Grandpa's birthday,
Edo losing a race...

14
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,821
Three events in just one day!

15
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,997
Maybe this year we'll be spared
Edo's dish.

16
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:11,208
What do you say, Betta?

17
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,877
Your sister's in a bad mood today.

18
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:18,507
- What's for breakfast?
- Thanks, Ida.

19
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,357
He's never this late.
He must really like this girl!

20
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,484
Hi, Anita.

21
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:40,862
- Good morning, Ida.
- Good morning, Edoardo.

22
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,824
- Good morning, Liliana.
- Good morning, Mr. Edoardo.

23
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:58,630
Here you are, my love.

24
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:03,093
- Thanks for the soup, Mama.
- I have to add some saffron.

25
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,595
- Who is she?
- Be nice to her, she's really shy.

26
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:08,765
Her name is Eva.

27
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,101
Ida is a little jealous.

28
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:41,214
Edo lost the race today.

29
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:44,217
He'll have more time
to concentrate on work.

30
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:46,803
Good morning, Madam.
Good morning, Sir.

31
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:50,515
- How are you, Ida?
- Very well, thank you. And you?

32
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:53,352
- You look well.
- Thank you.

33
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,398
Happy birthday.

34
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:03,195
- Good morning.
- How are you?

35
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,198
Very well, Madam.
And you?

36
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,784
We've been through happier times.

37
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,044
Look how they've grown.

38
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,341
Grandpa!

39
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:27,469
Elisabetta, how are you?

40
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:28,804
Fine.

41
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:31,473
- Nothing for me?
- Happy birthday, Grandpa.

42
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,107
They are here.

43
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,964
When did you get back?

44
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,757
I was a little late.

45
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,843
Who did you lose to today?
Gregorio?

46
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:11,847
No, to a guy I don't know.
I didn't lose, we tied.

47
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:16,184
Why didn't you challenge
the judge's ruling?

48
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:18,645
He deserved the victory.

49
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:24,901
I spoke to your brother this morning.
It's a pity you weren't there.

50
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,701
Your grandfather's
in an excellent mood today.

51
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:36,163
- ls this Eva from the Ugolini family?
- Yes, the poor side.

52
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:40,625
Gianluca, you're even more of a snob
than your father.

53
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,919
More than your grandmother!

54
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,505
Hello, Grandpa. Happy birthday.

55
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,261
It surprises me

56
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:56,266
that Tancredi gave it to Emma
as a wedding gift.

57
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:02,856
Tell me, how did you manage
to lose today's race?

58
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:07,694
It was fixed.
They wanted him out of the running.

59
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,238
I don't think so...

60
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,532
- I was up against someone stronger.
- Impossible!

61
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,826
- The Recchis are unbeatable.
- That's right.

62
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,878
The doctor said we shouldn't worry.

63
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,672
He is fighting with all his strength

64
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,634
and his heart is responding well.

65
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,058
He has decided.

66
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,940
I'm glad you lost the race.

67
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:50,445
From now on you won't have
any further distractions.

68
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,240
I want to go to London
to see Herzog and De Meuron.

69
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:56,201
- Who?
- They designed the new Tate Gallery.

70
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,203
The Tate Gallery?

71
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,872
I want to give them the scaffolding
covers for the next project.

72
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,085
- It'd guarantee years of work.
- Are you sure?

73
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,459
- Madam, you look beautiful.
- Thank you.

74
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,848
- How are we doing here?
- Well.

75
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,530
ls everything all right?

76
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:06,748
Betta, Eva works in Atellani's,
the bookshop on Corso Magenta.

77
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:10,126
The one below Grandpa's house?
I've never seen you there.

78
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:14,089
I've not been there long.
I'm in the art department.

79
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,809
- Where is Pierluigi?
- He's coming.

80
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,773
Thank you.

81
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,788
Not Edo's ukha dish again!
Enough!

82
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,209
No, it's fabulous!
"Ton sur ton."

83
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,002
You're right, Andrea.

84
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:57,006
"Ton sur ton"
is better than "con sur con"!

85
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:04,180
Eva, how did the race go?
You were there, right?

86
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:06,933
The guy who beat Edo is a chef.

87
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,185
- Do you know him?
- No.

88
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,855
But his restaurant is in a building
owned by my family.

89
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:16,526
- Beaten by a chef?
- It wasn't fair.

90
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:19,654
- Edo won.
- If you say so...

91
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:17,021
Shall we go?

92
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,943
- Can I see it?
- Together with the others.

93
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,444
Thanks.

94
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,574
Let's go.

95
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:47,427
May I have your attention?

96
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:52,098
I have all of my granddaughter's
drawings on a wall.

97
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:57,020
When she becomes a famous painter,
I'll have people pay to see them.

98
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:12,201
What is this?

99
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,790
I took it at the Hanbury Gardens.
You took me there.

100
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,419
I want to move into photography now.

101
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,007
I like it. It's beautiful.

102
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:31,971
Yes, I like it too.

103
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,351
I'm just thrown by novelties.

104
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:39,187
I don't think he likes it.

105
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:44,317
You still owe me a drawing.

106
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,235
Come here.

107
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,743
I like it. It's wonderful.

108
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,704
Really.

109
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,649
Thank you.

110
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,695
For you.

111
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,824
Thank you.

112
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,588
My dear friends,

113
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,425
I don't want to die

114
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:54,512
and I won't

115
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:58,599
as long as the business
carries on

116
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:01,144
in the same spirit

117
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:05,148
in which I created it.

118
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:13,364
Our family's fortune
is built on the factory.

119
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,826
Every brick, every man,

120
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,162
every piece of material

121
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:22,331
is living proof

122
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:26,377
of what we have been.

123
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:31,340
We engraved our name
in our country's history

124
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:34,594
when, both during the war
and after,

125
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,638
we were able to tend to its needs

126
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:41,809
with our factory's constant,
busy activity.

127
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:47,356
The company was born Recchi,
and Recchi it must remain forever.

128
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,447
The time has come

129
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:58,326
for me to retire

130
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:01,996
and name my successor.

131
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:10,379
My son has always lived up

132
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:12,882
to my expectations.

133
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:16,552
I knew he would from the moment
I first held him in my arms.

134
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,223
Thank you, Tancredi,

135
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,267
for having been
the son I always wanted

136
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:27,939
and for having created
such a marvelous family.

137
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:33,111
I see qualities in your children...

138
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:37,156
that will lead them
to live intense

139
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:40,952
and fruitful lives, as I have.

140
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:45,957
Of course, my grandson
had to choose this day

141
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:50,503
of all days to interrupt
our family's athletic tradition!

142
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,015
Therefore...

143
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,980
I have decided to leave

144
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,402
everything in your hands, Tancredi.

145
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,248
And in your son Edoardo's.

146
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:39,927
It will take two men
to replace me!

147
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:47,310
Here's to Tancredi and Edoardo!

148
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,353
To the Recchis!

149
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,320
Come here, you winner!

150
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,244
Go to the cellar.

151
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:07,914
Bring two bottles of '49.

152
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:28,184
Yes?

153
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:31,145
It's for Edoardo Recchi.

154
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:34,023
- Can I take it?
- I'd prefer to deliver it myself.

155
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,400
- Who are you?
- Antonio Biscaglia.

156
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,402
One moment.

157
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,492
This way.

158
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:49,205
Follow the path. It'll take you
to the entrance of the villa.

159
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,819
Ida, leave it.

160
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,244
What are you doing here?

161
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:33,207
That's the chef--
the one who beat Edo.

162
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,001
Come in!

163
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:40,673
I wanted to bring you a gift.

164
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,342
A gift?

165
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,887
For me? I get it. You're no longer
certain of your victory today.

166
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:50,641
- You put up a good fight.
- Come in.

167
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,310
It's a special night for my family.

168
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:56,564
I'd rather not, thanks.

169
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:57,773
As you wish.

170
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:02,486
I made you a cake.
I'm a chef.

171
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,615
Mama!

172
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:09,493
I want to show you something.

173
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:16,959
- This is Antonio.
- Good evening.

174
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:19,003
Look what he made for me.

175
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,256
Isn't it a work of art? He made it.

176
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:25,885
He's the guy that beat me today.
That's why he doesn't want to stay.

177
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:29,388
- Please stay.
- It doesn't matter, thanks.

178
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,975
- Are you going to bed, Mama?
- Yes, my love.

179
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,110
Ida!

180
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:49,492
I have to take this bottle to Grandpa
- don't let him leave!

181
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:54,163
- Should the cake go in the fridge?
- No.

182
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,082
Please, come in.

183
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:42,378
SOME MONTHS LATER

184
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,537
Good morning, Madam.

185
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:19,665
- How is your son, Edo?
- Fine, thank you.

186
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:22,710
- Just the blazer?
- Yes, only the blazer.

187
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:34,305
I've managed to get rid
of those nasty stains.

188
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,140
- It's fine.
- Yes.

189
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:46,525
This is for you.

190
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:50,779
Wait, Mrs. Recchi, I found this.

191
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:56,702
I saved it from the washing machine.
I made it just in time.

192
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,580
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

193
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:23,854
Being part of a couple is as nice
as being alone.

194
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,190
We need to be brave.

195
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:30,486
They are the words of a song
that a friend made me listen to.

196
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:33,864
She's the one in the photo.
Her name is Angaharad.

197
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:41,163
Edo, you're the only one
who loves me how I am.

198
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,626
I have been with a girl.

199
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:55,886
Gregorio keeps on phoning.
He pretends not to understand.

200
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,763
Maybe he doesn't understand.

201
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:06,272
I don't know if I'll see her again,
it was very beautiful.

202
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:10,985
But I'm in love with another girl.
I love Angaharad.

203
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:18,284
I don't know what she thinks of me,
or if she likes girls.

204
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:22,079
Does it matter?
Today I managed to make her laugh.

205
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,202
Antonio!

206
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,832
Antonio?

207
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:10,419
- Hi, Tom!
- You finally made it!

208
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:21,055
You told me
there were spectacular views,

209
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,725
but I can't see anything!

210
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:52,795
You're right, it's lovely here.

211
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:56,965
- Isn’t it a bit too remote?
- Two hours by car.

212
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,593
You're right.

213
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:06,725
I'm having a party at my house,

214
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:08,769
for Eva's birthday.

215
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,188
I want to ask her to marry me.

216
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:17,903
Don't you have anything to say?

217
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:21,532
- Congratulations.
- A little enthusiasm would be good!

218
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,410
Honestly, I'm happy.
Let's drink to it.

219
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,913
Best wishes!

220
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,922
Try this.

221
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,717
It's eggplant and elderflower,

222
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:42,428
I extracted the essence from here.

223
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:45,556
If I did this at the restaurant,
my father'd be mad.

224
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,100
He doesn't understand what I do.

225
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:51,186
He just thinks of the money.

226
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:57,067
Imagine a restaurant here.

227
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,820
People would have to climb up
to try my dishes.

228
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:02,781
The essence of flavors.
As simple as this place.

229
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:04,074
Do it.

230
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:07,786
- This is all his, he'd never let me.
- Have you asked him?

231
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:12,332
He thinks it's madness,
biting off more than I can chew.

232
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,418
He says nobody would come.

233
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:18,589
- I'll convince him.
- It's not that easy.

234
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:24,178
Come on, give me a hand.
You've become a real wimp.

235
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,930
Did you invite me here to work?

236
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,656
- Oh, how are you today?
- Doing well, thank you!

237
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:00,798
- Good morning! How are you?
- Fine, Rachele.

238
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:05,677
- I'm so glad you've stayed with us.
- Me too, Madam.

239
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:09,306
She is in a terrible mood,
despite having won the lottery.

240
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,351
Four straight numbers...
I should've listened to her!

241
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:15,103
- You too?
- I keep her company.

242
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:20,108
As if coming to my husband's funeral
wasn't enough for her.

243
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:23,737
She wrote that she shares my sorrow
over Edoardo's death.

244
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:27,741
Shares what?
My husband was mine alone,

245
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:30,911
and anything that happened
without me is of no importance!

246
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,831
- Emma!
- Andrea!

247
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:38,627
She's in a terrible rage!
I have to go.

248
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:41,922
- Conference call with your husband.
- Goodbye.

249
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:46,677
Thanks, Emma.

250
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,888
Tancredi called me
from London yesterday.

251
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:52,724
He is making important decisions.

252
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,645
It was like listening to his father.

253
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:59,231
He gets more like him every day.

254
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:03,151
Elisabetta?

255
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:07,865
She never calls. What is she up to?

256
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,993
She likes the school she has chosen.

257
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:14,538
She's very busy studying.

258
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:19,167
- She wanted to come back today...
- Do you like her?

259
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:20,544
Sorry?

260
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,505
Edo's girlfriend, the Ugolini girl.

261
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:26,592
Eva? She's very nice.

262
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:29,928
He seems happy with her.

263
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:33,056
I wouldn't be surprised

264
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:36,143
if they made
an important announcement soon.

265
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:39,688
The perfect wedding for her
and her family.

266
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:46,320
Marriage: Number 36 on the Lotto.

267
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:47,946
That should be lucky!

268
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:56,580
Let's carry on the family tradition.

269
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:57,915
Give it to her from me.

270
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,625
Thank you.

271
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,572
Ida, it's bustling!

272
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:34,451
We're almost done, Madam.
The chef's been cooking for two hours.

273
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,111
Mama!

274
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,531
Why are you here?

275
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:17,327
Remember Antonio?
You met on Grandpa's birthday.

276
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,247
Yes.

277
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,879
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Madam.

278
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:29,715
Excuse me.

279
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:34,302
Since I tried his cooking,
I fell in love with him.

280
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,847
Did you prepare all this
on your own?

281
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,807
No, Franco helped me.

282
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,019
Russian salad...

283
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:47,774
- Why don't you try?
- I don't know how...

284
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:52,279
- She's a great cook. Go on, Mama!
- Give it a go. It's not difficult.

285
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,870
- It looks dangerous.
- It isn't.

286
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,415
Be brave.

287
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,960
I'll help you.

288
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:13,800
- Hi, Franco.
- Good evening.

289
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:27,773
- Perfect, isn't it?
- Perfect!

290
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:24,412
Mama...

291
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,581
Were you sleeping?

292
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,463
Good idea.

293
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,549
You won't get any peace tonight.

294
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,851
Do you miss Russia?

295
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:47,602
Sometimes.

296
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:56,653
You know...

297
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,531
great things are happening there.

298
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,825
Sweetheart...

299
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,035
Bye.

300
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:25,992
- How is the party going?
- Very well, Madam.

301
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,124
Are you tired, Ida?

302
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:38,463
No, we've had tougher ones.
Anyway, Edo is so happy.

303
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:43,677
Please sit with me.
Tell me what's going on.

304
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:45,971
Edo has spent all evening with Eva.

305
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:48,598
He left her only to try and take

306
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:51,184
his chef friend away from the kitchen.

307
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:53,228
He thinks very highly of him.

308
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:56,189
Luckily, Mr. Tancredi is in London.

309
00:37:56,357 --> 00:38:00,277
He doesn't really like evenings
like these.

310
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,594
- Shall I close the curtains?
- Yes, thanks.

311
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:43,611
Did you see the wonderful dish
your son's friend sent you?

312
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,375
The party cost more than we'd agreed.

313
00:38:57,543 --> 00:39:00,420
It was a lovely evening.

314
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,547
Edo was so happy.

315
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:04,841
A shame you weren't there.

316
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,469
Do you think he wants to marry her?

317
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:11,473
Your mother is convinced.

318
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,516
Elisabetta thinks so too.

319
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:17,103
How is Betta?

320
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:20,106
I thought she looked well;
maybe a bit sad.

321
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:22,525
I think she wants to get back
with Gregorio.

322
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:25,695
She told me
you're picking her up tomorrow.

323
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:28,406
Yes, after lunch with Rori.

324
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:32,702
I have to admit I was wrong. Going to
London was the right thing for her.

325
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:36,414
She likes it there.
She seems more motivated.

326
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:41,878
I don't think she will go back
to Gregorio.

327
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,381
She doesn't love him.

328
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:45,840
Ida?

329
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,928
Here.

330
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,807
What does that mean?

331
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:01,189
What does Edo think of selling?

332
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:04,025
He is slowly coming to terms with it.

333
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:06,945
He can't remain anchored to the past.

334
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:10,740
Gianluca thinks that selling
is the only sensible option.

335
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:14,244
And what do you think
about his restaurant idea?

336
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,787
It's his money!

337
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:22,794
You know what I think
about my father's decision?

338
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:25,338
Edo isn't at all ready

339
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:28,091
to make decisions
about the company.

340
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:31,469
He still needs a lot of guidance.

341
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:44,732
Edoardo's mother has confirmed
three people for one o'clock.

342
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,609
Yes, I know.

343
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,736
- What's she like?
- Who?

344
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:51,573
Mrs. Recchi.
ls she a nice person?

345
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:54,617
She's nice.

346
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,414
Can I have the press?

347
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:03,042
Thanks.

348
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,350
What are you charging Edo
for the party?

349
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:21,936
It was my gift to him.

350
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:32,530
Leghorn-style cod.
This goes onto the menu.

351
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:34,532
We did it!

352
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:47,462
1995 Bergheim Riesling Altenberg.

353
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,214
Excellent.

354
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:53,968
The first time my son mentioned Emma

355
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:56,930
was when we were at La Scala,
on St. Ambrose's feast day.

356
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:59,265
You were still in Russia.

357
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:04,020
Tancredi said, "Mama, I'm marrying
a woman more beautiful than you."

358
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:06,481
Naturally, I didn't believe him.

359
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,612
To the Recchi wives!

360
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:21,538
Coming here today was a great idea.

361
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:24,791
Edo is right to believe
in his friend.

362
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:26,584
He's a real talent.

363
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:28,503
I'm worried they're pushing it a bit.

364
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:33,841
The idea of the restaurant
was rather rushed.

365
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:38,471
Too much enthusiasm
can cause one not to think straight.

366
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:41,599
Edoardo is an intelligent man.

367
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:43,601
He knows what he's doing.

368
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:48,898
Marinated egg yolk, pea cream
and zucchini flowers;

369
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:53,736
prawns with ratatouille
and sweet-and-sour sauce;

370
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:56,155
and mixed fish
with crunchy vegetables.

371
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:58,241
Enjoy your meal.

372
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:04,914
Where would you like to live?

373
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,500
I wouldn't mind London.

374
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:11,170
I know a law firm
where I could be an apprentice.

375
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:13,339
I love the city...

376
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:04,057
Welcome, ladies.

377
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:07,727
Antonio, this is Edo's grandmother.
You already know Emma.

378
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:11,022
- How do you do?
- An excellent meal.

379
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:14,108
I heard of your project
with my grandson.

380
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:17,945
I'd be happy to give my opinion
regarding the furnishing.

381
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:21,032
Thank you.
And thanks for coming.

382
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:30,249
They seemed happy.

383
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:32,794
I think so.

384
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:35,213
I made prawns for your mother.

385
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:42,887
I know my father
only listens to you,

386
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:44,972
but I'll try and tell him.

387
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:52,188
Rori, excuse me a moment.

388
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:01,280
Am I interrupting?

389
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:05,284
- I'd like to thank you. You are great.
- Thanks.

390
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:08,371
The risotto, the prawns,
the vegetables...

391
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:10,123
they were exquisite.

392
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:13,084
- I grow the vegetables myself.
- Really? Where?

393
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:15,712
Near Sanremo, in the countryside,

394
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:18,715
where your son and I plan
to set up our restaurant.

395
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:21,676
How will you manage not being here?

396
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:25,972
Hey, Franco, let me do that.

397
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,306
Good evening, Madam.

398
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:29,350
I'll go on Thursdays
when we are closed here,

399
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:32,145
and between shifts whenever I can.

400
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:37,066
- See you soon.
- With pleasure.

401
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:38,693
Here I am!

402
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:52,934
Mama! Grandma!

403
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:56,604
How wonderful to see you.

404
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:04,320
- How was the trip?
- Fine.

405
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:09,951
- How are you?
- Very well.

406
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:14,163
Betta!

407
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:25,007
Why did you come?

408
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:28,261
What do you mean, why?
What have you done?

409
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:30,638
- Goodbye.
- What?

410
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:32,390
Shall we go?

411
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:08,384
I'm sorry I missed Eva's party.

412
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:12,972
Edo's crazy about Antonio, right?
They want to open a restaurant.

413
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,766
He wants me to stop off
on my way to Nice.

414
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:18,102
- For your exhibition?
- Yes.

415
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:25,735
- Can I tell you something?
- Of course.

416
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:38,205
I left Gregorio for her.

417
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:41,959
It's not a passing thing, I'm sure.

418
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:49,383
Do you like her?

419
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:52,136
She's beautiful.

420
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:54,055
Very beautiful.

421
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:58,059
I don't want to tell dad,
or Gianluca.

422
00:48:58,226 --> 00:49:00,102
They wouldn't understand.

423
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:07,109
Here, she looks amazing.

424
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:08,694
Why don't you come to Nice with me?

425
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:17,995
- I might.
- We can be together.

426
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:49,777
Can I offer you something to drink?

427
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:52,029
Why don't you come with me?

428
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:54,865
We can look for a space
for my exhibition.

429
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:58,828
We'll leave on Tuesday,
Sanremo to Nice.

430
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:01,080
What will you do
when we're all in London?

431
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:05,418
I grow the vegetables myself,
near Sanremo.

432
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:07,962
Her name's Angaharad,
she's my teacher.

433
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:11,340
Edo can't stay anchored
to the past, things change.

434
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:44,540
Edo, darling...

435
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,417
I'm out of town.

436
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:49,211
I've decided
to go to see Betta in Nice.

437
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:52,465
But don't tell her.

438
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:57,970
I'll call you later.

439
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:16,942
- I'll be right with you, Madam.
- Thank you.

440
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:03,155
Mrs. Recchi!

441
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:05,157
How come you're here?

442
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:08,535
I'm going to visit Betta.

443
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:10,454
Oh, the exhibition in Nice.
Edo told me about it.

444
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:15,584
- How about you?
- The restaurant is closed today.

445
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,795
Right, it's Thursday...

446
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:19,880
the countryside... the vegetables.

447
00:54:20,882 --> 00:54:23,676
If you aren't too busy,
why don't you come with me?

448
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:27,179
It's just a slight detour.

449
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:29,974
I'll show you where Edo and I
will open the restaurant.

450
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:31,892
He's already been there a few times.

451
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:34,603
Okay.

452
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:37,439
My truck's there.

453
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:17,313
- Were you born here?
- No, my father's from here.

454
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:23,110
The land is my grandfather's.
I started cooking here as a child.

455
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:26,196
I love cooking,

456
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:28,741
but I'm not as good as you.

457
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:31,994
Edo tells me the opposite.
He always talks about you.

458
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,579
And he talks to me about you.

459
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:39,126
He'll be happy you came.

460
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:52,032
Take a little walk around.
I'll be back in a bit.

461
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:54,881
Something smells good, Ida.

462
00:59:55,049 --> 00:59:57,759
I made spelt soup.

463
01:00:14,527 --> 01:00:17,321
Why don't you dine
with me this evening?

464
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:20,407
It's strange being in an empty house.

465
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:24,411
Thank you, Madam,

466
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:27,372
but you know I have my ways.

467
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,625
- They could change.
- No...

468
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:38,508
- Your son called.
- What did he say?

469
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:42,179
He asked if you'll pass by the factory
to say goodbye, before he leaves.

470
01:01:33,272 --> 01:01:35,565
Bye, see you in half an hour.

471
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:38,694
How are you, Eva?

472
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:56,169
We fired too many workers.

473
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:59,423
We had responsibilities towards them.

474
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:01,049
Think of their families.

475
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:03,510
Grandpa wouldn't have done this.

476
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:07,514
Yes, he would. He always did
what was best for the company.

477
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:08,849
That's not true.

478
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:13,061
Respect for the name, traditions
and values is what matters.

479
01:02:15,773 --> 01:02:18,275
There.

480
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:22,404
Don't be a hypocrite.
You know it's not like that.

481
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:25,282
Grandpa had no qualms
about dealing with the regime,

482
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:28,076
acting as if nothing was going on

483
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:31,747
while he exploited Jewish workers.

484
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:33,248
That's what we are.

485
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,792
That's what we Recchis are.

486
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:38,420
We'll talk about this again in London.

487
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:41,757
Too many things are heading
in the wrong direction.

488
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:46,928
I'm always so happy to come here.

489
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:49,931
I came here with Grandpa as a kid.

490
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:54,644
He brought me here into the canteen
and sat amongst the workers.

491
01:02:54,812 --> 01:02:57,272
He enjoyed making them believe
he was one of them.

492
01:03:00,234 --> 01:03:03,653
Time moves on.
Things change.

493
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:30,138
Mama, at last!

494
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:33,975
We've finished. Everything
is being sent to London today.

495
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,894
Are you coming to say goodbye?

496
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:38,355
Pity...

497
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:41,107
Never mind, it's nothing.
How are you, though?

498
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:54,598
Antonio!

499
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:12,157
I wanted you to have it
before I leave.

500
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:17,954
Your father has signed.

501
01:05:18,122 --> 01:05:22,542
He's granted us half of the land
and permission to open the restaurant.

502
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:27,797
You don't seem very happy.

503
01:05:36,557 --> 01:05:40,352
Tell you what, I'll look at the papers

504
01:05:40,519 --> 01:05:41,561
and we'll talk when you get back.

505
01:05:43,689 --> 01:05:45,690
If you aren't sure, just tell me.

506
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:47,859
Sorry.

507
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:50,987
You know how I am,
certain things embarrass me.

508
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:09,589
We're hosting a big dinner.
My father wants you to handle it.

509
01:06:09,757 --> 01:06:12,133
It's an important business dinner.

510
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:15,136
My mother will call you
with the details.

511
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:18,556
Once you've read it, call me.

512
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:09,607
Do you like this CD?

513
01:08:22,139 --> 01:08:23,807
How are you?

514
01:08:23,974 --> 01:08:26,684
Good morning. A Chinotto please.

515
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:28,353
Thanks.

516
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:35,652
So, for the dinner...

517
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:39,948
What do you suggest?

518
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:42,575
Ligurian dishes?

519
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:50,708
You left this in the truck.

520
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:34,247
Once, Edo told me about a dish
you make for him.

521
01:11:34,415 --> 01:11:36,916
He said it's difficult to make.

522
01:11:37,084 --> 01:11:38,876
Ukha.

523
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:46,759
You need someone to catch

524
01:11:46,927 --> 01:11:51,431
a great deal of fish from a river...

525
01:11:53,017 --> 01:11:55,018
lots of different kinds.

526
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:01,149
The most important thing is...

527
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:08,031
that the broth must be clear.

528
01:12:09,783 --> 01:12:12,493
You must be able to see through it.

529
01:12:25,632 --> 01:12:30,261
When I moved to Milan,
I stopped being Russian.

530
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:32,889
There was too much of everything,

531
01:12:33,057 --> 01:12:35,516
in the streets, in the shops...

532
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:39,562
I learned to be Italian.

533
01:12:41,148 --> 01:12:45,777
Tancredi collected art. He came
to Russia in search of treasure.

534
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:49,906
My father was a restorer.

535
01:12:50,074 --> 01:12:52,617
Tancredi used to come to our house.

536
01:12:52,785 --> 01:12:55,912
One day he asked me out.

537
01:12:56,080 --> 01:13:00,041
He was shy and sweet.

538
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:02,043
We couldn't be seen in public,

539
01:13:02,211 --> 01:13:04,754
so we rode in a cab until dawn

540
01:13:04,922 --> 01:13:07,382
and then made love.

541
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:10,093
He brought me to Milan

542
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:13,471
and I haven't been back to Russia since.

543
01:13:15,682 --> 01:13:18,393
If I got homesick, I cooked.

544
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:23,064
One day I made a soup
that my grandmother taught me.

545
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:25,650
Ukha.

546
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:29,487
Edo, who was six then,
liked it so much

547
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:32,323
he kept asking me to make more.

548
01:13:33,575 --> 01:13:36,661
Edo loves my being Russian.

549
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:44,836
Emma...

550
01:13:45,003 --> 01:13:49,132
Emma is not my real name.

551
01:13:49,299 --> 01:13:51,926
Tancredi gave it to me.

552
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:55,972
What is your real name?

553
01:13:57,224 --> 01:13:59,267
I no longer know it.

554
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:07,358
At home...

555
01:14:07,526 --> 01:14:09,694
they all called me Kitesh.

556
01:14:12,865 --> 01:14:14,657
Say it.

557
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:00,109
Sell.

558
01:19:42,819 --> 01:19:47,239
Your grandfather was a great man,
but we have to look to the future.

559
01:20:13,141 --> 01:20:15,267
Papa!

560
01:20:15,435 --> 01:20:16,977
What, Edo?

561
01:21:26,756 --> 01:21:29,133
Gianluca took me to the Atlantique.

562
01:21:29,301 --> 01:21:33,137
I thought I'd get him back by
taking him to an Electrelane concert.

563
01:21:34,222 --> 01:21:36,056
But he loved it!

564
01:21:36,224 --> 01:21:40,185
Being among a crowd
of ecstatic lesbians!

565
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:51,655
Betta, it's done. We're selling.

566
01:21:51,823 --> 01:21:54,909
We'll be even richer.

567
01:22:07,130 --> 01:22:08,464
Come here.

568
01:22:18,725 --> 01:22:21,477
Thanks, if it weren't for you...

569
01:22:21,645 --> 01:22:24,939
You mustn't thank me.
I did it out of selfishness.

570
01:22:27,067 --> 01:22:29,610
I'm happy knowing you're happy.

571
01:22:32,030 --> 01:22:36,825
Happy? "Happy" is a word
that makes one sad.

572
01:22:44,501 --> 01:22:46,961
Why aren't you happy?

573
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:14,863
Edo, what's wrong?

574
01:23:25,959 --> 01:23:28,419
- Can you give this to Mama?
- Yes, sure.

575
01:26:12,667 --> 01:26:15,377
You look nice with short hair.

576
01:26:20,967 --> 01:26:23,760
Did you speak to Edoardo?

577
01:26:23,928 --> 01:26:28,056
When we got back,
I found him relieved.

578
01:26:28,224 --> 01:26:30,184
It's important for us all
to stick together.

579
01:26:33,688 --> 01:26:36,982
- Sorry, were you watching it?
- No, don't worry.

580
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:38,942
I'm tired.

581
01:27:14,812 --> 01:27:16,605
- Liliana!
- Yes?

582
01:27:16,773 --> 01:27:19,399
They're here. Go and help them.

583
01:27:22,403 --> 01:27:24,821
Good morning, Madam.
Can I help you?

584
01:27:24,989 --> 01:27:26,031
Thank you.

585
01:27:36,167 --> 01:27:38,460
You disappeared without telling me.

586
01:28:10,493 --> 01:28:12,286
Good evening.

587
01:28:35,476 --> 01:28:38,687
Mama, let me introduce you
to Shai Kubelkian.

588
01:28:39,814 --> 01:28:42,691
Good evening, I'm Rori.

589
01:28:42,859 --> 01:28:45,068
- Beatrice Tavecchia.
- Good evening.

590
01:28:59,208 --> 01:29:01,335
- Sorry?
- Tancredi told him you're Russian.

591
01:29:13,431 --> 01:29:14,598
Thanks.

592
01:29:28,571 --> 01:29:30,447
Can I talk to you?

593
01:29:36,287 --> 01:29:40,040
- I want to see you happy.
- I am happy.

594
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:43,377
Thanks to you, to Antonio,
to my mother,

595
01:29:43,544 --> 01:29:46,421
and to him, or her.

596
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:51,635
Excuse me.

597
01:29:51,803 --> 01:29:53,595
Mama!

598
01:30:52,864 --> 01:30:55,699
Does Edo know
you prepared his soup?

599
01:30:55,867 --> 01:30:57,492
No, he doesn't.

600
01:30:57,660 --> 01:30:59,244
He'll be pleased.

601
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:01,765
- You have wonderful children.
- Thanks.

602
01:33:09,667 --> 01:33:11,293
Darling...

603
01:33:12,503 --> 01:33:13,753
Thank you, Mama.

604
01:33:15,256 --> 01:33:17,299
I'll go, you stay here.

605
01:33:22,054 --> 01:33:26,182
Please forgive us. You've now seen
an example of Russian temper.

606
01:33:27,810 --> 01:33:29,477
Edo and his mother...

607
01:33:46,245 --> 01:33:48,079
Wait!

608
01:33:50,374 --> 01:33:52,208
Wait for me!

609
01:33:55,254 --> 01:33:57,088
Listen to me!

610
01:34:00,676 --> 01:34:02,719
Let's talk.

611
01:34:08,643 --> 01:34:11,227
I beg you, look at me and listen!

612
01:34:14,732 --> 01:34:17,525
- You're lying.
- What?

613
01:34:17,693 --> 01:34:20,111
- You're just like the others.
- What do you mean?

614
01:34:20,279 --> 01:34:22,614
You're just like Gianluca,
Papa, Antonio.

615
01:34:22,782 --> 01:34:26,284
You even gave him our ukha.

616
01:34:26,452 --> 01:34:29,621
I wanted to tell you something
important, but no...

617
01:34:29,789 --> 01:34:32,624
I don't want anything to do with you,
you're nothing to me.

618
01:34:32,792 --> 01:34:37,128
Trust me, Edo!

619
01:34:37,296 --> 01:34:38,338
Don't touch me!

620
01:35:54,331 --> 01:35:55,915
Good evening.

621
01:36:05,593 --> 01:36:07,385
I don't have good news...

622
01:36:08,596 --> 01:36:12,056
Your son suffered a head injury

623
01:36:12,224 --> 01:36:15,477
which caused a hematoma
that pressed against his brain.

624
01:36:15,644 --> 01:36:18,897
So we removed it.

625
01:36:19,064 --> 01:36:24,152
But the fall also caused
a more serious hemorrhage.

626
01:36:29,366 --> 01:36:31,868
He never regained consciousness.

627
01:36:32,036 --> 01:36:34,788
I don't think he suffered.

628
01:36:36,832 --> 01:36:39,000
I'm sorry.

629
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:41,377
I'll take you to him.

630
01:40:58,552 --> 01:41:00,470
Kitesh...

631
01:41:03,348 --> 01:41:04,849
Emma!

632
01:41:32,169 --> 01:41:34,003
Madam.

633
01:41:40,928 --> 01:41:43,012
You have to wake up.

634
01:42:54,501 --> 01:42:56,377
Our Lord Jesus Christ,

635
01:42:56,545 --> 01:42:59,255
who after resting three days
in the sepulcher

636
01:42:59,423 --> 01:43:03,134
gave assurance of resurrection

637
01:43:03,302 --> 01:43:06,554
to those who believe in You,

638
01:43:06,722 --> 01:43:11,017
let our brother Edoardo
rest in peace

639
01:43:11,185 --> 01:43:15,938
until the day You,
the Resurrection and the Life,

640
01:43:16,106 --> 01:43:19,775
will illuminate him
with the splendor of Your vision

641
01:43:19,943 --> 01:43:23,821
so that he may see the glory
of Your Kingdom,

642
01:43:23,989 --> 01:43:27,241
You who live and reign eternally.

643
01:43:27,409 --> 01:43:29,493
Amen.

644
01:43:31,330 --> 01:43:32,788
Give him everlasting rest

645
01:43:32,956 --> 01:43:34,540
and eternal peace

646
01:43:34,708 --> 01:43:38,669
in the glory of Your light. Amen.

647
01:47:50,755 --> 01:47:53,883
Emma...

648
01:48:16,531 --> 01:48:21,202
You no longer know who I am.

649
01:48:32,839 --> 01:48:36,175
Darling, please.

650
01:48:36,343 --> 01:48:39,220
We mustn't go out of our minds.

651
01:48:40,639 --> 01:48:43,057
We have to carry on.

652
01:48:46,478 --> 01:48:48,896
Together.

653
01:49:37,779 --> 01:49:40,614
I love Antonio.

654
01:50:17,277 --> 01:50:20,237
You don't exist.

655
01:51:25,845 --> 01:51:34,770
Madam!

656
01:53:52,659 --> 01:53:56,119
Gianluca?

657
01:53:56,287 --> 01:53:57,913
Rori?

658
01:54:16,391 --> 01:54:18,350
Betta?

659
01:54:27,610 --> 01:54:29,236
Mama?
