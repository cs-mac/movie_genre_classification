00:00:35,934 --> 00:00:37,567
Episode 57

2
00:00:38,434 --> 00:00:40,100
What do you mean Phillip invested in Shuwei?

3
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:40,901
When?

4
00:00:40,901 --> 00:00:42,834
The time frame fits perfectly, too.

5
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:45,300
He did it just as Shuwei signed with Cloud.

6
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,400
Then Phillip invested in Shuwei so that

7
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,500
they'd break the contract with us?

8
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,634
I'm afraid so.

9
00:00:53,133 --> 00:00:55,000
That despicable bastard.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,567
He made a plot to invade us.

11
00:00:57,567 --> 00:00:59,901
I believe Attorney Seo was bought off as well.

12
00:00:59,901 --> 00:01:01,434
He was in charge of the Shuwei contract

13
00:01:01,434 --> 00:01:03,400
and he probably re-drafted it.

14
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,834
Seo suddenly quit and disappeared

15
00:01:05,834 --> 00:01:08,934
just before Shuwei broke the contract.

16
00:01:08,934 --> 00:01:11,033
That means he's not after profits.

17
00:01:11,033 --> 00:01:13,567
He's trying to takeover our company.

18
00:01:13,567 --> 00:01:15,667
I'm certain money isn't his objective.

19
00:01:15,667 --> 00:01:18,834
Are you sure he's not doing this

20
00:01:18,834 --> 00:01:21,234
because of you and Areum?

21
00:01:21,234 --> 00:01:22,834
He must've thought the failure with Dio

22
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:24,901
was a big deal.

23
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:27,100
I hear he asked Areum to work in his office.

24
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:27,767
Yes.

25
00:01:27,767 --> 00:01:29,500
You should've gotten her to resign

26
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,701
when I asked you to.

27
00:01:31,701 --> 00:01:34,634
Why put the company in danger for her?

28
00:01:37,033 --> 00:01:40,200
No use crying over spilled milk.

29
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,033
I'm sure Phillip won't act for a while,

30
00:01:43,033 --> 00:01:45,400
so we'll have to come up with a resolution.

31
00:01:46,133 --> 00:01:49,767
We shouldn't have given him authority

32
00:01:49,767 --> 00:01:52,167
over business affairs and human resources.

33
00:01:52,167 --> 00:01:54,968
I'll figure out Seo's whereabouts.

34
00:01:54,968 --> 00:01:57,167
If we find a witness for the manipulation

35
00:01:57,167 --> 00:01:58,968
of the contract, we can get Phillip.

36
00:01:58,968 --> 00:02:01,767
You think Seo will be that easy to find?

37
00:02:01,767 --> 00:02:03,400
We'll have to at least try.

38
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,400
Did you go somewhere?

39
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,467
Yeah. The president's office.

40
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,067
Is something wrong?

41
00:02:36,067 --> 00:02:37,434
No.

42
00:02:37,434 --> 00:02:39,567
Is everything going well for you?

43
00:02:39,567 --> 00:02:41,834
Yes. I'll show you the designs

44
00:02:41,834 --> 00:02:43,334
as soon as I'm done.

45
00:02:43,334 --> 00:02:44,767
Look them over and give me feedback.

46
00:02:44,767 --> 00:02:46,767
I'll update them and keep you posted.

47
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:48,968
Okay, if you need fabric or anything else,

48
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:50,734
feel free to ask me at any time.

49
00:02:50,734 --> 00:02:52,334
Okay.

50
00:02:52,334 --> 00:02:55,000
You know the clothes

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,067
that we collected from Dongdaemun?

52
00:02:58,067 --> 00:02:58,968
Yeah.

53
00:02:58,968 --> 00:03:02,234
If you don't need them, may I have them?

54
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:05,601
Well, I paid for them myself, so sure.

55
00:03:05,601 --> 00:03:08,167
They were going to be thrown out anyway.

56
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:10,467
What are you going to do with them?

57
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:13,367
I just need them.

58
00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:16,634
Thank you. I'll put them to good use.

59
00:03:16,634 --> 00:03:17,868
Okay. Sure.

60
00:03:18,634 --> 00:03:19,667
Bye.

61
00:03:38,234 --> 00:03:39,434
What did Seo's secretary say?

62
00:03:39,434 --> 00:03:41,234
Just before he disappeared

63
00:03:41,234 --> 00:03:42,734
was he acting strangely at all?

64
00:03:42,734 --> 00:03:45,567
Not really, but at his office,

65
00:03:45,567 --> 00:03:47,901
there were copies of plane tickets.

66
00:03:47,901 --> 00:03:49,834
Plane tickets? To what destination?

67
00:03:49,834 --> 00:03:51,634
Los Angeles International Airport.

68
00:03:51,634 --> 00:03:54,968
He cut contact with his family and went to LA?

69
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:57,934
Get Attorney Seo's schedule for the week

70
00:03:57,934 --> 00:03:59,834
before he quit from his secretary.

71
00:03:59,834 --> 00:04:02,167
Find out who he met, where and when.

72
00:04:02,167 --> 00:04:03,634
Yes, sir.

73
00:04:17,234 --> 00:04:20,200
You can hate and torture me.

74
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,500
But don't do this.

75
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,367
The company...

76
00:04:24,367 --> 00:04:26,500
Seongun has nothing to do with this.

77
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,367
If you want, I'll quit.

78
00:04:28,367 --> 00:04:31,400
So please, stop this.

79
00:04:41,434 --> 00:04:42,667
Hello, Mr. Park.

80
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:44,601
Can we talk in my office?

81
00:04:44,601 --> 00:04:46,701
Please bring the other board members, too.

82
00:04:48,467 --> 00:04:51,667
Did you get a good grasp of the company?

83
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:53,067
Yes.

84
00:04:53,067 --> 00:04:56,167
There are many issues all across the board.

85
00:04:56,167 --> 00:04:58,968
Which part in particular?

86
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,200
How is it that after Director Cheon's

87
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,534
major debacle in entering the Chinese market,

88
00:05:04,534 --> 00:05:06,934
he faced no repercussions?

89
00:05:07,801 --> 00:05:09,934
Well, that...

90
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,901
That's because he's the son of the CEO and...

91
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,400
This is how Korean companies

92
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,667
get criticized for nepotism culture.

93
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:20,400
Without any effort, for being the CEO's son,

94
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,567
he has 10% of the company shares?

95
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:25,133
After such a catastrophic failure,

96
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:26,601
the company lets him off the hook?

97
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,033
Let's talk more about this

98
00:05:36,033 --> 00:05:38,801
during this week's board meeting.

99
00:05:38,801 --> 00:05:39,934
That's all.

100
00:05:58,033 --> 00:06:01,000
Here's the K-project strategy report.

101
00:06:02,834 --> 00:06:04,834
A charity business for an orphanage?

102
00:06:05,734 --> 00:06:07,534
Interesting.

103
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:08,734
Was this your idea?

104
00:06:08,734 --> 00:06:11,934
No, it was Director Cheon's idea.

105
00:06:12,934 --> 00:06:15,234
I thought he was a complete waste of space,

106
00:06:15,234 --> 00:06:16,734
but I guess he occasionally uses his brain.

107
00:06:20,634 --> 00:06:23,167
What? Are you upset by what I said?

108
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:28,033
You're the absolute worst.

109
00:06:28,033 --> 00:06:30,200
Don't just blame me.

110
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,100
If you have the courage, then try.

111
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:36,167
You have the courage to kneel for Seongun,

112
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:38,500
but not enough to admit you love him?

113
00:06:39,868 --> 00:06:42,634
You already revealed that you're a single mom.

114
00:06:42,634 --> 00:06:44,901
While you're at it, why don't you

115
00:06:44,901 --> 00:06:47,367
tell everyone you're a single mom in love?

116
00:06:48,834 --> 00:06:52,934
Keep trying to hurt me. I won't flinch.

117
00:06:52,934 --> 00:06:54,100
Gladly.

118
00:06:54,734 --> 00:06:57,300
Are you looking into Tiffany's custody rights?

119
00:06:59,367 --> 00:07:01,968
If you can't come back to me,

120
00:07:01,968 --> 00:07:03,400
we should settle Tiffany's custody issues

121
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,634
before you go to another guy.

122
00:07:33,868 --> 00:07:35,133
Hello?

123
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:39,033
I scheduled a consultation with Attorney Lee.

124
00:07:39,033 --> 00:07:43,167
I'm pressed for time. May I see her this week?

125
00:07:43,701 --> 00:07:46,701
Okay, I would appreciate your help.

126
00:07:46,701 --> 00:07:48,133
Please call me.

127
00:08:05,767 --> 00:08:07,801
I asked Attorney Ko for information on

128
00:08:07,801 --> 00:08:10,067
legal provisions for export customs clearance,

129
00:08:10,067 --> 00:08:11,868
so ask her for them.

130
00:08:17,334 --> 00:08:18,601
Hello.

131
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:22,300
Is Attorney Ko out?

132
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,300
Yes. She's out and she'll be back later.

133
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,901
May I help you?

134
00:08:26,901 --> 00:08:30,634
Yes, I'm here for the files Phillip asked for.

135
00:08:30,634 --> 00:08:33,968
Attorney Ko prepared those files already.

136
00:08:33,968 --> 00:08:35,000
Just a moment.

137
00:08:49,701 --> 00:08:50,934
Here you go.

138
00:08:50,934 --> 00:08:54,567
Great. Thank you. Have a good day.

139
00:09:14,634 --> 00:09:17,367
Detailed Summary of Suspect, Ha Yunsu

140
00:09:17,868 --> 00:09:19,534
Ha Yunsu...

141
00:09:22,868 --> 00:09:24,634
Ha Yunsu.

142
00:09:24,634 --> 00:09:25,801
You're Ha Yunsu, correct?

143
00:09:25,801 --> 00:09:27,100
Who are you?

144
00:09:28,133 --> 00:09:29,667
I was designed those clothes.

145
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:32,067
I know you're the one who distributed them.

146
00:09:46,367 --> 00:09:48,434
Don't you know how to knock?

147
00:09:48,434 --> 00:09:49,500
What's this?

148
00:09:52,267 --> 00:09:54,467
Why do you have this?

149
00:09:54,467 --> 00:09:56,534
These are classified.

150
00:09:56,534 --> 00:09:58,434
Were you snooping around in my office?

151
00:09:58,434 --> 00:10:00,601
At least you're not denying

152
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:02,067
that this was in your office.

153
00:10:03,267 --> 00:10:07,234
You know that Ha Yunsu is the suspect

154
00:10:07,234 --> 00:10:08,934
I talked to about the circulation

155
00:10:08,934 --> 00:10:10,400
of my designs, correct?

156
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,234
What in the world are you talking about?

157
00:10:12,234 --> 00:10:14,767
I had a feeling that the woman

158
00:10:14,767 --> 00:10:16,968
in the subway security footage was you.

159
00:10:16,968 --> 00:10:18,701
But I didn't want to believe it.

160
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,167
I hoped that it wasn't.

161
00:10:21,033 --> 00:10:22,334
So?

162
00:10:22,334 --> 00:10:25,334
You're saying I stole your designs?

163
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:26,834
As this company's lawyer,

164
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,667
I'm allowed to look at these files!

165
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:30,334
You lined up the evidence

166
00:10:30,334 --> 00:10:32,267
just to frame me, didn't you?

167
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,868
If you threaten me without proof again,

168
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:38,734
I'll show you how frightening the law can be.

169
00:10:38,734 --> 00:10:41,968
If you know the law so well,

170
00:10:41,968 --> 00:10:43,267
how could you do this?

171
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:44,767
Shut your mouth!

172
00:10:44,767 --> 00:10:50,300
I felt guilty towards you.

173
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,667
I hurt you

174
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:55,667
and I never apologized properly.

175
00:10:55,667 --> 00:10:58,767
You have every reason to dislike me

176
00:10:58,767 --> 00:11:02,100
and perhaps even hate me. I get it.

177
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,500
Shut up!

178
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,500
I don't want to hear that from you.

179
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,100
But I didn't do it deliberately.

180
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,100
I didn't do it because I didn't like you

181
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,067
or because I hated you.

182
00:11:13,067 --> 00:11:14,500
I hope you know that.

183
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,167
And...

184
00:11:17,167 --> 00:11:20,100
I'm sorry for all the grief I caused you,

185
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,968
but now we're even.

186
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,901
Let's let bygones be bygones.

187
00:11:26,901 --> 00:11:31,534
Don't let something like this happen again.

188
00:11:43,334 --> 00:11:45,500
How dare you act so high and mighty!

189
00:11:47,901 --> 00:11:49,434
This is so unlike you, sir.

190
00:11:49,434 --> 00:11:52,767
You're letting me join you two for drinks?

191
00:11:52,767 --> 00:11:56,000
Seongun's having a hard time at work lately.

192
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,033
I invited him here to console him.

193
00:11:58,033 --> 00:12:00,901
Oh, my. What's the matter?

194
00:12:01,801 --> 00:12:03,667
You're worried?

195
00:12:03,667 --> 00:12:05,300
Of course.

196
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,067
Sir, this isn't enough.

197
00:12:08,067 --> 00:12:10,801
Why don't we take Seongun

198
00:12:10,801 --> 00:12:13,400
on a family trip this weekend?

199
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,868
Should we?

200
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:18,167
I'd rather just go on a trip with you, Ms. Lee.

201
00:12:19,467 --> 00:12:20,567
Really?

202
00:12:20,567 --> 00:12:22,634
I'd be happy to. Where to?

203
00:12:22,634 --> 00:12:25,133
- Bundang. / - Bundang?

204
00:12:25,734 --> 00:12:27,801
To my mother's charnel house.

205
00:12:27,801 --> 00:12:31,234
It'd console me quite a bit if you came with me.

206
00:12:31,234 --> 00:12:32,667
Really?

207
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:34,868
I've been meaning to go see your mother.

208
00:12:34,868 --> 00:12:36,133
That'd be nice.

209
00:12:36,133 --> 00:12:37,901
You can pick the date.

210
00:12:39,334 --> 00:12:42,334
Oh, about Seongho's boarding school.

211
00:12:42,334 --> 00:12:43,067
Yes?

212
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:45,601
You can send him abroad for a year or two.

213
00:12:45,601 --> 00:12:47,467
I can really do that?

214
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:48,601
Sure.

215
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,667
But I want you to go with him.

216
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:53,234
What?

217
00:12:53,234 --> 00:12:55,534
We can't send the boy alone.

218
00:12:55,534 --> 00:12:58,434
He needs his mother close by.

219
00:12:58,434 --> 00:13:01,033
You should also go to clear your head.

220
00:13:01,033 --> 00:13:03,367
Okay, I'll give it some thought.

221
00:13:05,901 --> 00:13:07,167
Let's drink.

222
00:13:17,701 --> 00:13:19,901
You're eating so well.

223
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:21,467
You're done now?

224
00:13:23,234 --> 00:13:24,801
Let's see.

225
00:13:27,767 --> 00:13:30,934
Baby food...

226
00:13:30,934 --> 00:13:32,534
2:20, milk.

227
00:13:32,534 --> 00:13:34,200
4:00, milk.

228
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,534
7:00, baby food.

229
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:40,734
- Mom. / - Hey.

230
00:13:43,167 --> 00:13:44,400
You're home early.

231
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,100
Yeah, I wanted to work from home.

232
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,567
I'm home.

233
00:13:48,567 --> 00:13:50,934
I just fed her baby food.

234
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,801
Mom.

235
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:59,234
Are you still really upset because of me?

236
00:13:59,234 --> 00:14:00,667
I'm sorry.

237
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:04,500
Please forgive me.

238
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,901
Let go. I have to make dinner.

239
00:14:07,901 --> 00:14:09,200
That's okay, mom.

240
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,300
I'll do it. Just a second.

241
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,434
Where's mom?

242
00:14:20,434 --> 00:14:23,801
She doesn't feel like eating, so she'll eat later.

243
00:14:24,701 --> 00:14:27,434
Dad, about the home for single moms

244
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:29,901
you told me about before...

245
00:14:29,901 --> 00:14:30,801
Yeah?

246
00:14:30,801 --> 00:14:32,367
Can you give me the address?

247
00:14:32,367 --> 00:14:33,734
I want to send them some

248
00:14:33,734 --> 00:14:36,567
overstocked children's clothes from work.

249
00:14:36,567 --> 00:14:38,334
- Children's clothes? / - Yes.

250
00:14:38,334 --> 00:14:40,868
There are lots of children there, right?

251
00:14:40,868 --> 00:14:41,968
I'd like to go visit the place

252
00:14:41,968 --> 00:14:44,100
and meet the mothers and children myself,

253
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,100
but I got assigned a new task at work

254
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,767
so I'd like to just send the clothes for now.

255
00:14:48,767 --> 00:14:52,434
Okay, I'll give you the address tomorrow.

256
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:53,500
Okay.

257
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,601
Is mom not well?

258
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,734
Just as grandpa said,

259
00:15:10,734 --> 00:15:12,834
we have a place to call home

260
00:15:12,834 --> 00:15:16,667
and you have grandma, grandpa and an uncle.

261
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:19,534
We're truly blessed, aren't we?

262
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:29,567
Tiffany, I have to work

263
00:15:29,567 --> 00:15:31,334
so play by yourself for a bit.

264
00:15:45,601 --> 00:15:46,734
Honey.

265
00:15:48,834 --> 00:15:49,934
What?

266
00:15:50,834 --> 00:15:54,701
A while back on TV,

267
00:15:54,701 --> 00:15:57,133
there was a woman who had dementia,

268
00:15:57,133 --> 00:16:00,067
so her husband quit his job

269
00:16:00,067 --> 00:16:03,567
to nurse her with great care.

270
00:16:03,567 --> 00:16:08,234
What would you do in that situation?

271
00:16:09,467 --> 00:16:12,000
What a silly question.

272
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:15,801
When I saw that, I wondered

273
00:16:15,801 --> 00:16:22,200
what we would do if we were in that situation.

274
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,200
We're getting older.

275
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,434
They say there's no cure for dementia.

276
00:16:32,434 --> 00:16:35,567
Rather than make the family suffer,

277
00:16:35,567 --> 00:16:37,133
it's best to just accept it.

278
00:16:38,067 --> 00:16:39,767
Really?

279
00:16:39,767 --> 00:16:45,968
Squandering money and energy on treatment

280
00:16:45,968 --> 00:16:50,701
will only make the family hurt even more.

281
00:16:50,701 --> 00:16:52,367
That's what dementia is.

282
00:16:52,367 --> 00:16:57,234
A nursing home would be the best option

283
00:16:57,234 --> 00:16:59,734
for both the patient and the family.

284
00:17:04,434 --> 00:17:06,100
I guess you're right.

285
00:17:09,267 --> 00:17:10,834
Go to sleep now.

286
00:17:13,434 --> 00:17:14,567
Okay.

287
00:17:16,834 --> 00:17:20,334
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

288
00:17:39,868 --> 00:17:44,167
They say husbands are merely strangers...

289
00:18:31,367 --> 00:18:33,567
- You're just getting in? / - Yes.

290
00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:34,734
Father.

291
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:41,434
Are you and Ms. Lee having issues?

292
00:18:41,434 --> 00:18:43,367
You two seemed pretty distant last night.

293
00:18:43,367 --> 00:18:44,567
You even asked her to follow Seongho

294
00:18:44,567 --> 00:18:45,767
to boarding school.

295
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,801
I'm concerned about her these days.

296
00:18:48,801 --> 00:18:51,801
Why? Is something going on?

297
00:18:51,801 --> 00:18:53,934
I think she's plotting with Mr. Park.

298
00:18:53,934 --> 00:18:55,667
With Mr. Park?

299
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,534
Act like you don't know.

300
00:19:00,534 --> 00:19:03,601
And keep your eyes on Phillip.

301
00:19:04,767 --> 00:19:06,934
Be on your toes.

302
00:19:06,934 --> 00:19:08,734
Yes, sir.

303
00:19:17,234 --> 00:19:18,601
Good morning.

304
00:19:23,801 --> 00:19:26,701
Were you at the storage room this morning?

305
00:19:26,701 --> 00:19:27,634
Yes.

306
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,734
How's it going? Working there's tough, right?

307
00:19:30,734 --> 00:19:31,767
It's alright.

308
00:19:31,767 --> 00:19:33,500
It felt nice to touch chalk

309
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,467
and use the sewing machine again.

310
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:36,801
I'm happy.

311
00:19:37,367 --> 00:19:40,067
And don't call it the storage room anymore.

312
00:19:40,067 --> 00:19:42,067
Call it the studio.

313
00:19:42,734 --> 00:19:43,801
Sorry.

314
00:19:43,801 --> 00:19:46,834
Storage room does sound pretty shabby.

315
00:19:48,701 --> 00:19:51,467
Don't overdo it.

316
00:19:51,467 --> 00:19:54,968
I can't pay you since this project is a secret.

317
00:19:54,968 --> 00:19:55,934
I know.

318
00:19:57,267 --> 00:19:58,467
Have a great day.

319
00:19:58,467 --> 00:20:01,167
Okay. You, too.

320
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:02,267
Bye.

321
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:19,834
Hyeokmin.

322
00:20:19,834 --> 00:20:21,234
Take good care of the business.

323
00:20:22,801 --> 00:20:25,868
I can't believe my son lived in a rented room!

324
00:20:25,868 --> 00:20:29,033
- Hyeokmin! / - Father!

325
00:20:29,033 --> 00:20:30,367
My son!

326
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:34,801
All ready.

327
00:20:37,968 --> 00:20:40,934
Now that I got a job,

328
00:20:40,934 --> 00:20:43,300
I'll bring each and every paycheck to you.

329
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,234
Yes, please do just that.

330
00:20:46,234 --> 00:20:48,334
Hyeokmin, let's eat.

331
00:20:48,334 --> 00:20:51,033
What are you doing? Are you feeling sick?

332
00:20:51,033 --> 00:20:51,968
I'm fine.

333
00:20:51,968 --> 00:20:54,234
What are you saying?

334
00:20:54,234 --> 00:20:55,801
Come over here so we can eat.

335
00:20:55,801 --> 00:20:57,534
Mother, father.

336
00:20:57,534 --> 00:21:01,133
I feel the "storm and stress" period upon me.

337
00:21:01,133 --> 00:21:02,434
Storm and stress?

338
00:21:02,434 --> 00:21:03,934
What do you mean by that?

339
00:21:03,934 --> 00:21:07,467
My mind is endlessly filling with thoughts

340
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:09,567
that I should not be having.

341
00:21:09,567 --> 00:21:12,801
I'm thinking about...

342
00:21:14,734 --> 00:21:15,634
Never mind.

343
00:21:15,634 --> 00:21:18,334
What am I saying in front of my parents...

344
00:21:20,601 --> 00:21:23,467
I think I will skip one meal.

345
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,367
Hyeokmin...

346
00:21:27,367 --> 00:21:29,400
Father, mother. Enjoy your meal.

347
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,734
Hyeokmin!

348
00:21:31,934 --> 00:21:33,934
What will we do?

349
00:21:33,934 --> 00:21:34,834
What's wrong with him?

350
00:21:34,834 --> 00:21:37,033
You heard what he said.

351
00:21:37,033 --> 00:21:38,667
He's hitting puberty.

352
00:21:38,667 --> 00:21:40,634
He must be thinking about, you know...

353
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:43,400
What will we do? How embarrassing.

354
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,767
Tell him about the birds and the bees.

355
00:21:45,767 --> 00:21:47,133
The birds and the bees?

356
00:21:47,133 --> 00:21:49,200
Hyeokmin? Already?

357
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,200
I heard kids grow up quickly these days but...

358
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,901
Well, I can't talk to him about it.

359
00:21:52,901 --> 00:21:55,701
What if he starts looking at dirty stuff?

360
00:21:55,701 --> 00:21:58,200
You should sit him down and teach him.

361
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:03,300
I'm not an expert in that department either.

362
00:22:04,767 --> 00:22:06,334
The birds and the bees...

363
00:22:08,067 --> 00:22:09,100
Yes.

364
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,000
I'll run away at night if I have to.

365
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,267
I can't let Yujin take over my life.

366
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,000
Busy?

367
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,968
No. What's up?

368
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:27,167
I actually need your help with something.

369
00:22:27,167 --> 00:22:29,234
How can I help?

370
00:22:29,234 --> 00:22:30,734
Well...

371
00:22:34,434 --> 00:22:35,567
Oh!

372
00:22:37,234 --> 00:22:38,467
Of course.

373
00:22:38,467 --> 00:22:41,667
Hyeokmin's already got a mustache.

374
00:22:41,667 --> 00:22:43,968
He's a man now.

375
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:46,567
I just feel so awkward about it.

376
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:49,434
You should've come to me sooner.

377
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:50,734
Ta-da!

378
00:22:52,267 --> 00:22:53,934
This is the perfect textbook

379
00:22:53,934 --> 00:22:56,968
for an elementary school kid.

380
00:22:58,234 --> 00:23:00,801
You think? Thanks.

381
00:23:00,801 --> 00:23:02,000
I have one for middle schoolers, too.

382
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,868
I'm okay. Next time.

383
00:23:04,868 --> 00:23:05,834
The high school version?

384
00:23:08,901 --> 00:23:11,734
Close the door and come here.

385
00:23:11,734 --> 00:23:12,901
Sit down.

386
00:23:12,901 --> 00:23:15,400
I have something to show you.

387
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,701
What will you show me this time?

388
00:23:19,067 --> 00:23:20,400
Father!

389
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,834
It's okay to look at this with me.

390
00:23:23,834 --> 00:23:26,200
Father, how...

391
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,801
How can you show a child such a thing?

392
00:23:28,801 --> 00:23:31,968
You mentioned storm and stress, and so...

393
00:23:31,968 --> 00:23:33,801
Father and son may have a close bond,

394
00:23:33,801 --> 00:23:36,267
but how can a father show his own son

395
00:23:36,267 --> 00:23:39,400
such obscenities in broad daylight?

396
00:23:40,033 --> 00:23:41,100
Obscenities?

397
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,000
You ought to be ashamed of yourself!

398
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,200
I'm really disappointed in you, father!

399
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,834
Was it that extreme?

400
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,267
Tonight, that good-for-nothing Sua...

401
00:23:58,267 --> 00:23:59,534
Who's Sua?

402
00:23:59,534 --> 00:24:01,167
My daughter.

403
00:24:01,167 --> 00:24:02,868
Oh, your daughter.

404
00:24:02,868 --> 00:24:06,567
Was being so harsh on me that I got mad.

405
00:24:06,567 --> 00:24:07,968
What's the use in raising kids?

406
00:24:07,968 --> 00:24:10,834
She should be grateful, that brat.

407
00:24:11,968 --> 00:24:14,734
My journal is full of complaints.

408
00:24:14,734 --> 00:24:17,067
It's good, it's very real.

409
00:24:17,067 --> 00:24:19,400
When you praise me like that,

410
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,033
I don't know what to say.

411
00:24:22,701 --> 00:24:25,968
This is my gift to you.

412
00:24:25,968 --> 00:24:28,400
A gift?

413
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,868
They're a collection of poems written by

414
00:24:31,868 --> 00:24:34,167
women who learned to read later on in life.

415
00:24:34,167 --> 00:24:38,133
Read this and try to write a poem yourself.

416
00:24:38,133 --> 00:24:39,701
A poem, you say?

417
00:24:41,434 --> 00:24:44,500
Each day, with a baby on my back,

418
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,133
I work the fields

419
00:24:46,133 --> 00:24:50,167
and go to the forest to gather wood.

420
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:54,000
I weave straw by a kerosene lamp.

421
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,734
Then I wake again to make breakfast.

422
00:24:56,734 --> 00:24:59,500
I found I have no time to be loved.

423
00:25:00,601 --> 00:25:02,734
Oh, my.

424
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:06,000
The tears are keeping me from reading.

425
00:25:09,067 --> 00:25:14,033
Though I've lived for so many years,

426
00:25:14,033 --> 00:25:17,067
I have never been loved.

427
00:25:19,767 --> 00:25:22,267
Maybe I should try writing a poem.

428
00:25:33,267 --> 00:25:34,634
You're home early.

429
00:25:34,634 --> 00:25:36,467
Shall I draw you a bath?

430
00:25:36,467 --> 00:25:39,334
No, I don't even have the strength for that.

431
00:25:39,334 --> 00:25:42,267
I'm just going to wash my face and lie down.

432
00:25:42,267 --> 00:25:43,234
Oh, no.

433
00:25:43,234 --> 00:25:46,000
Things must be really tough at work.

434
00:25:46,734 --> 00:25:48,434
They are.

435
00:25:48,434 --> 00:25:51,033
Phillip's poking his nose into everything.

436
00:25:51,033 --> 00:25:54,868
He seems to be making quite a mess of things.

437
00:25:54,868 --> 00:25:57,133
I can't let this go on.

438
00:25:58,234 --> 00:26:01,500
I'll have to sell your shares and Seongho's.

439
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,300
What? What do you mean?

440
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,901
You'll sell our shares?

441
00:26:05,901 --> 00:26:08,868
Not all of them, just some of them.

442
00:26:08,868 --> 00:26:10,601
The company's facing hard times

443
00:26:10,601 --> 00:26:13,267
so we have to give up our shares first.

444
00:26:13,267 --> 00:26:15,400
I'll give them back when things get better.

445
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,067
I told Seongun the same thing.

446
00:26:17,901 --> 00:26:20,701
If things are tough, we have no choice.

447
00:26:22,334 --> 00:26:25,634
I knew you'd understand.

448
00:26:25,634 --> 00:26:28,467
- Thank you. / - You're welcome.

449
00:26:28,467 --> 00:26:30,968
I'm hungry. Will you get dinner ready?

450
00:26:30,968 --> 00:26:32,400
Sure.

451
00:26:43,734 --> 00:26:46,334
I'm sorry for all the grief I caused you,

452
00:26:46,334 --> 00:26:48,234
but now we're even.

453
00:26:49,267 --> 00:26:52,701
Let's let bygones be bygones.

454
00:26:52,701 --> 00:26:57,133
Don't let something like this happen again.

455
00:27:03,734 --> 00:27:04,801
Yes, Ms. Lee.

456
00:27:04,801 --> 00:27:06,100
Are you at home?

457
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,868
I'm still at the office. I'm about to go home.

458
00:27:08,868 --> 00:27:11,000
Did you meet with the accounting team leader?

459
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,934
Not yet. I'm carefully biding my time.

460
00:27:14,934 --> 00:27:16,400
Hurry up!

461
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,767
What'll you do if you miss the timing?

462
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:22,267
Are you sure we should be doing this?

463
00:27:22,267 --> 00:27:25,133
Messing with accounting is a big offense.

464
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,100
Yuni, are you still hesitating

465
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:31,300
even after what Seongun put you through?

466
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,267
It's not that.

467
00:27:33,267 --> 00:27:34,667
After what Seongun did to you,

468
00:27:34,667 --> 00:27:37,033
you could be doing far worse things!

469
00:27:37,834 --> 00:27:40,300
No matter what, I won't let you take the fall,

470
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,834
so get moving.

471
00:27:41,834 --> 00:27:44,100
We can't wait any longer.

472
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,868
Okay.

473
00:28:29,467 --> 00:28:30,868
It's cold in the storage room,

474
00:28:30,868 --> 00:28:32,367
so take an electric heater with you.

475
00:28:32,367 --> 00:28:33,567
What's this?

476
00:28:33,567 --> 00:28:35,968
She's still fraternizing with Seongun?

477
00:28:39,033 --> 00:28:41,968
And take a cab home if it gets too late.

478
00:28:41,968 --> 00:28:43,734
Unbelievable.

479
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,567
The storage room?

480
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,901
I should call home to say that I'll be late.

481
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,834
Where's my cell phone?

482
00:31:57,634 --> 00:31:59,434
Did I leave it in the office?

483
00:32:15,234 --> 00:32:16,734
Anyone out there?

484
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,467
Anyone?

485
00:32:28,133 --> 00:32:29,300
Anyone?

486
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:33,968
I'm locked in here! Help!

487
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,300
Why isn't she responding to my texts?

488
00:32:46,701 --> 00:32:48,667
She's probably not sleeping yet.

489
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:50,033
Is she watching Tiffany?

490
00:32:57,667 --> 00:32:58,901
Anyone out there?

491
00:33:02,067 --> 00:33:03,634
Anyone?

492
00:33:03,634 --> 00:33:06,467
I'm trapped in here!

493
00:33:06,467 --> 00:33:07,634
Help me!

494
00:33:08,968 --> 00:33:11,534
I'm trapped in here! Help!

495
00:33:13,267 --> 00:33:14,667
Anyone out there?

496
00:33:16,133 --> 00:33:19,133
Anyone? Please open the door!

497
00:33:21,601 --> 00:33:24,067
I'm trapped in here!

498
00:33:24,067 --> 00:33:25,667
Open the door!

499
00:34:58,434 --> 00:34:59,634
About the custody rights...

500
00:34:59,634 --> 00:35:00,634
I'm raising Tiffany.

501
00:35:00,634 --> 00:35:01,667
She's mine, too.

502
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:03,701
How can you decide that alone?

503
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:04,734
For unmarried couples,

504
00:35:04,734 --> 00:35:07,100
courts tend to rule in favor of mothers.

505
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:10,601
The law may be set, but the verdict is not.

506
00:35:10,601 --> 00:35:12,601
Do you mean I could win custody?

507
00:35:12,601 --> 00:35:13,500
Of course.

508
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,067
The contract was switched out.

509
00:35:15,067 --> 00:35:16,601
I think someone fabricated it.

510
00:35:16,601 --> 00:35:19,133
Did you find any sort of proof?

511
00:35:19,133 --> 00:35:20,968
I was wondering if you had any good news.

512
00:35:20,968 --> 00:35:22,667
Don't worry. By tomorrow,

513
00:35:22,667 --> 00:35:24,300
Seongun will be gone.
