1
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,831
Mars...

2
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,711
... so you name it,
and think that you know it.

3
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:42,946
The Red Planet.

4
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,068
No air, no life.

5
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:50,750
But you do not know Mars,
for its true name is Barsoom.

6
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,506
And it is not airless,
nor is it dead.

7
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,868
But it is dying.

8
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,345
The city of Zodanga saw to that.

9
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:08,224
Zodanga, the predator city...

10
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,908
... moving, devouring...

11
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,220
... draining Barsoom
of energy and life.

12
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:21,310
Only the great city of Helium
dared resist, stood strong...

13
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,781
... matched Zodanga
airship for airship...

14
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,221
... holding fast for a thousand years.

15
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,148
Until one day
the ruler of Zodanga...

16
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,740
... became cornered
in a sandstorm.

17
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,262
And everything changed.

18
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,351
I need clean lights!

19
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,421
Full loft, aye!

20
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,861
Full loft!

21
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,816
Intensity full!

22
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,221
- Hard turn! Come about!
- Facing new plot!

23
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,746
No time!
Hard turn now!

24
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,625
There!

25
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,586
- Shadow!
- Shadow!

26
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,385
Death to Helium!

27
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,786
Being a fool is a great luxury,
Sab Than.

28
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,742
Get up.

29
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,106
Who... what are you?

30
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,542
We serve the Goddess.

31
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,223
And she has chosen you
to receive this weapon.

32
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,150
Do as we command and
you will rule all of Barsoom.

33
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,828
With none to defy you.

34
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,790
And nothing to stand in your way.

35
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,985
Ma'am.

36
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,590
Ten words a minimum.

37
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,630
That's 50 cents,
unless you want special delivery.

38
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,428
Special delivery it is.

39
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,270
Name of sender?

40
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,644
Carter.

41
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,709
John Carter.

42
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,782
Croton-on-Hudson!

43
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,107
- Mr. Burroughs?
- Yes.

44
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,507
I'm Thompson,
Captain Carter's butler.

45
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,221
Sir, I'm afraid I bring sad tidings.

46
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,381
Mr. Burroughs, Noah Dalton,
your uncle's attorney.

47
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,742
My deepest sympathies.

48
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,383
His death came
as a shock to all of us.

49
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,027
He was a model
of health and vigor.

50
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,784
He just dropped dead
in his study...

51
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,581
... not five minutes after sending
word for me and the doctor.

52
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,085
When I arrived,
he was already gone.

53
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,461
The man never stopped digging.

54
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,383
All over the world.

55
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:52,309
No soon he started digging
one hole, then he was off to Java...

56
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,860
... or the Orkney Islands
to dig another.

57
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,410
He said it was pure research...

58
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,869
... but it always seemed to me
like he was looking for something.

59
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,128
Oh, and God grant me
he's found it now.

60
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,266
Every inch a cavalry man,
to the very end.

61
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,941
Mother always said that Jack
never really came back from the war.

62
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,107
That it was only his body
that went west.

63
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:37,030
He used to tell me
the most wondrous stories.

64
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:44,486
I'd like to pay my respects.

65
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,382
You won't find a keyhole.

66
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,031
Thing only opens
from the inside.

67
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,790
He insisted.

68
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,744
No embalming,
an open coffin, no funeral.

69
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,006
You don't acquire the kind of
wealth your uncle commanded...

70
00:08:00,008 --> 00:08:02,302
... by being like the rest of us, huh?

71
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,828
Come, let's go inside.

72
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,463
"And lastly, I hereby direct...

73
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:29,267
... that my estate shall be
held in trust for 25 years...

74
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,991
... the income to benefit
my beloved nephew...

75
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,983
... Edgar Rice Burroughs...

76
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,508
... at the end of which term
the principal will revert to him."

77
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,987
In full.

78
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:51,944
Of course I always adored him,
but it's been so long.

79
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,564
Why me?

80
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:57,462
He never offered an explanation,
I never asked him for one.

81
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,831
It was his private journal.

82
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,624
He was most explicit that you...

83
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,624
... and only you,
would read its contents.

84
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,546
Now, you might possibly find
some kind of explanation in here.

85
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,724
I'll leave you now.

86
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:24,045
Again... my condolences.

87
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,821
My dear Edgar...

88
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,023
... I remember how
I used to take you on my knee...

89
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,664
... and tell you wild tales...

90
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,584
... which you always did me
the great courtesy of believing.

91
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,748
Now you are grown.

92
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,504
Time and space have parted us...

93
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,662
... but I reach out
across that distance...

94
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,310
... to that same wide-eyed boy...

95
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,462
... and ask him
to believe me once more.

96
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,389
This wild tale
begins 13 years ago...

97
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,189
... in the Arizona Territory...

98
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:22,630
... between the Pinaleno Mountains
and the backside of hell.

99
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,762
Fort Grant Outpost, 1868

100
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,484
Ah...

101
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,149
Coming to load up on spider bait.

102
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,347
No more, Carter.

103
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,770
Is there a problem, Mr. Dix?

104
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,362
Yes, you're a goddamn loon!

105
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,363
I done took all your money, Carter.
Your tab's $100 in arrears.

106
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,771
I'll pay...

107
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,523
This old Yavapai I met
said he'd seen a cave...

108
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,685
No. Stop! Not one more word
about your cave of gold.

109
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,086
Oh, now, now.

110
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,204
Show some respect!

111
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,966
It's the evil spider cave of gold.

112
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,762
You're cut off, Carter.

113
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,970
Now get on home.

114
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,207
Now, I do believe...

115
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,442
... he done told you
to get on out of here.

116
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,966
I'll leave when these bags are full.

117
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,005
I found that two days ago
up by Bonita.

118
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,642
That ought to cover my tab
and then some.

119
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,549
Beans.

120
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,088
The first item is beans.

121
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,645
John Carter?

122
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,782
Your presence
is requested up at the fort.

123
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,248
I suggest you come peaceably.

124
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,608
Do you, now?

125
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,720
You are a difficult man to find,
Captain John Carter.

126
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,683
First Virginia Cavalry...

127
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,081
... Army of Northern Virginia...

128
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,043
... Confederate States of America.

129
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,124
I'm Colonel Powell.

130
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,847
Welcome to the 7th Cavalry
of the United States...

131
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,409
Excellent horseman.

132
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,723
Fine swordsman.

133
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,205
Decorated six times, including
the Southern Cross of Honor.

134
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:06,368
At Five Forks, the company under
your command nearly turned the tide.

135
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,411
In short, a born fighter.

136
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,045
And in the eyes of Uncle Sam...

137
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,530
... a necessary man for the defense
of the Arizona Territory.

138
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,896
No.

139
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,725
Son, we are up to
our chinstraps in Apaches.

140
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,006
Ain't my concern.

141
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,651
I believe it is your concern, Captain.

142
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,485
Folks are being attacked
in their own homes. Slain.

143
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,311
You started it.
You finish it.

144
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,163
You've gone native, have you?

145
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,368
Apaches can go to hell, too.

146
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,129
We're nothing but a warring
species, and I want no part of it.

147
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,201
You're a cavalry man.

148
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,363
That makes you valuable
to our country and our cause.

149
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,887
Colonel Powell, sir...

150
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,970
... whatever it is
you suppose I owe you...

151
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,846
... our country or any
other beloved cause...

152
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,082
... I have already paid.

153
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,409
I have paid in full, sir.

154
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,928
So let me tell you what I will do.

155
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,569
I will break me out of this cell.

156
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,584
I will claim my gold
and get filthy rich.

157
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,686
Rich enough to buy your flat,
righteous blue behind...

158
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,921
... just so I can kick it all day long.

159
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,364
Captain, I'm finding it difficult
to reconcile the man...

160
00:14:41,454 --> 00:14:44,171
... on this piece of paper
with the one I'm looking at.

161
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,549
Now, I suggest you find the
horse sense to accept my offer...

162
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,966
... before I give in
to my better judgment.

163
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,924
Private, the man stays in
the bull pit till further notice.

164
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,481
Yes, sir!

165
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,004
John?

166
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,508
John?

167
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,164
Sleepy-head.

168
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,925
Supper's waiting for you.

169
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,926
Hey, hey, hey!

170
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,923
Hey!
I gave you a bucket.

171
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,604
I ain't going to tell you again.

172
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,125
Use the...

173
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,605
- Colonel Powell!
- Argh!

174
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,945
Colonel Powell!

175
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,988
Colonel Powell!

176
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,904
Colonel Powell!

177
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,611
Sir, he stole your horse.

178
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,520
No.
Son of a...

179
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,600
Carter!

180
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,245
That's Domingo's band!

181
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,004
Shut your damn mouth, Corporal.

182
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,011
What's he saying, Carter?

183
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,570
What the hell's he saying now?

184
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,361
What the hell's he saying, Carter?

185
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,521
He's saying...

186
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,086
Carter!

187
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,130
Argh!

188
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,449
I thought you didn't care?

189
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,926
I don't!

190
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,285
Get up!
Come on.

191
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,144
Give me a gun.
Give me a gun!

192
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,451
I've got to look.

193
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,521
Cover me.

194
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,528
The spider.

195
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,550
This place sure ain't Apache.

196
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,288
It sure ain't.

197
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,065
Gold.

198
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,401
Carter!

199
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,864
Right behind you!

200
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,421
Carter!

201
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,969
Ock ohem ocktei...

202
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,601
... wies.

203
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,951
Barsoom.

204
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,482
- What?
- Barsoom.

205
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,321
Barsoom?

206
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,303
Oh, gee!

207
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,291
What the...

208
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,170
No, no, no!

209
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,485
What...

210
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,788
Where the hell am I?

211
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,506
What the...

212
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,368
All right.

213
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,569
You've got me.

214
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,802
I surrender.

215
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,045
Jeddak.

216
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,709
- Jeddak?
- Jeddak.

217
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,928
Tars Tarkas

218
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,862
Tars Tarkas?

219
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:35,007
Captain John Carter, Virginia.

220
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,347
Vorginia.

221
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,641
Vorginia!

222
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,209
No.

223
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,648
My name is John Carter.

224
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,209
I'm from Virginia.

225
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,680
Virginia.

226
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,765
Sack...

227
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,100
Sack.

228
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,171
Sack.

229
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,163
Yes, sir.

230
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,025
Virginia... Virginia.

231
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,866
What is this place?
Where am I?

232
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,044
Where is my damn gold?

233
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,923
Where on Earth am I?

234
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,527
Barsoom, a world on the brink.

235
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,041
For Zodanga's new power threatens
to destroy our city of Helium.

236
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:20,051
And if Helium falls,
so does Barsoom.

237
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,282
Rubbish.

238
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,363
Goddess, help me, I'm hopeless.

239
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,982
I always come on too strong.

240
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,502
Your Highness.

241
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,321
My Jeddak.

242
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,708
My Jeddak.

243
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:46,664
After years of tireless research,
I present to you...

244
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,362
... the answer.

245
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,188
I hope.

246
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:05,008
- My Jeddak, after years of...
- I'm sorry, Princess.

247
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,168
The presentation will have to wait.

248
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,142
- Father, what's happened?
- Dejah!

249
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,641
I know the terms set by Sab Than.

250
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,031
What I want to know
is can we afford to reject them?

251
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,825
Admiral Kantos Kan.

252
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,226
The eastern border is a wasteland.

253
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,330
Sab Than has burned
through our defenses...

254
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:36,323
... and the border folk
will be massacred.

255
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:41,329
Our best troops and fleetest ships
are proven less than useless...

256
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:45,007
... and now comes word that
our last remaining squadron...

257
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,685
... has been lost.

258
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,483
Helium is lost.

259
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,441
My people.

260
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,270
I have failed them all.

261
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,487
No, my Jeddak, you haven't!

262
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,563
Forgive me, my lady,
but you have not seen this weapon.

263
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,490
It radiates the most intense,
baleful...

264
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,111
... blue light.

265
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,524
When I read our reports
on Sab Than's weapon, I knew.

266
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,951
Somehow that idiotic brute
had discovered it first.

267
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,321
Discovered what?

268
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,591
The Ninth Ray.

269
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,225
Unlimited power.

270
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,687
Sab Than only
uses it for slaughter.

271
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,681
But think of what Helium might
accomplish with such power.

272
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,446
Transform the deserts,
restore the seas.

273
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,888
Is this what you saw, Kantos?

274
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:49,010
It's starting to look very close.

275
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,121
Give it time.

276
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,926
It will work.

277
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,522
Everyone, leave us.

278
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:33,206
Dejah, ever since
you were a little girl...

279
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,865
... you've always met the
expectations placed on you.

280
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,924
It's Sab's terms.

281
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,525
What are they?

282
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,146
He will spare Helium...

283
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,705
... if you accept
his hand in marriage.

284
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,551
No!

285
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,621
He is a monster!
You must refuse him!

286
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,364
He's already on his way here.

287
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,400
But all of my work...

288
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,965
I just need a little more time.

289
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,849
- Dejah!
- How can you...

290
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:16,006
- You can't just bow down to Zodanga!
- A wedding will save the city.

291
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,889
Perhaps, but it could
lose you Barsoom.

292
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,041
Dejah!

293
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,407
With no one to stop Zodanga,
it will be the beginning of the end!

294
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,404
- We do not have the luxury...
- You are the Jeddak of Helium!

295
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,891
You must find another way!

296
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,564
There is no other way!

297
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:47,370
If there were, I would risk
anything to seize it.

298
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,590
This is the chance
we have been given.

299
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:56,421
Perhaps it is the will
of the Goddess.

300
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,880
No.

301
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,865
It is your will.

302
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:11,487
So when I was little, and we
would look up at the stars...

303
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:16,206
... and you would tell me of the heroes
whose glory was written in the sky.

304
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,762
How there was a star
up there for me.

305
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,824
Is this what you imagined
would be written on it?

306
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,451
My Jeddak.

307
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,962
Sab Than's corsair
approaches the city.

308
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,522
They signal for permission to land.

309
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,148
Granted.

310
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:57,027
And let us prepare ourselves
for a wedding.

311
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,441
I have destroyed the device,
Matai Shang.

312
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,845
She was on the verge of discovery.

313
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,005
All is in place.
They will consent to the wedding.

314
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,808
Keep close watch over her.

315
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,687
We don't want anything
to interfere with our next move.

316
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,085
What happened to you?

317
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:40,828
Virginia...

318
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,165
Wait, wait, wait!

319
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,403
What's in that stuff?

320
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,540
Easy.

321
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:01,006
Nice monster dog.

322
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,849
How the hell did you...

323
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,209
Quit it!

324
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,907
Stop it!

325
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,002
You killed him with one blow.

326
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,086
I...

327
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,242
Wait.

328
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,886
I understood you.

329
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,722
What have you done?

330
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,326
Get off!

331
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,302
Get off him!

332
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,881
How did this happen?

333
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,443
Who is to blame?

334
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,144
Woola.

335
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,861
Do that again and I...

336
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,591
Enough!

337
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:06,304
There is no room
for another mark, Sola.

338
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,121
Your next offense
will be your last.

339
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,322
You will jump, Virginia.

340
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,007
Now.

341
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,003
Jeddak!
Fliers!

342
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,009
You are the stones, the sand!

343
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,841
Sir, they continue
to ignore our signals.

344
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,364
Enough! I've been patient.
I will not be mocked.

345
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,521
Let them die!

346
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,644
If that's how you plan
to treat your future bride...

347
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,808
... it's no wonder she ran from you.

348
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,647
Dejah Thoris must live.

349
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,967
In range, sir.

350
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,880
You need only cripple the ship.

351
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,811
A pulse to the radium drive
will be sufficient.

352
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,890
Quick, clean, and precise.

353
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,169
Jeddak, shall we destroy her?

354
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:22,806
No.

355
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,650
We need only cripple her.

356
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,926
Now bring us around.

357
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,411
Zodanga.

358
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,562
- Helium.
- Helium.

359
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,880
Helium.

360
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,371
Zodanga.

361
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,727
They are the red flag,
Helium the blue.

362
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,007
Zodanga's winning the war...

363
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:41,369
... but I say let red men kill
red men until only Tharks remain.

364
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,249
That don't look like a fair fight.

365
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:56,043
Zodanga never fights fair.

366
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,320
Where is she?

367
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,000
My Jeddak, that's all of them.

368
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,844
She can't have just
vanished into thin air.

369
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,550
- Check the dead.
- We have, sire.

370
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,089
Then check them again.

371
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,281
To the bridge, now!

372
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,146
Look out!

373
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,101
She's a human!

374
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,390
Sola!

375
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,367
Who is that?

376
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,049
I bet Virginia.

377
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,081
Beg your pardon, ma'am.

378
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,488
If you'll kindly
just stand behind me.

379
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,325
This might get dangerous.

380
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:31,321
Or maybe I ought
to get behind you.

381
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,202
You let me know
when it gets dangerous.

382
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:25,505
No.

383
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,126
Take him alive.

384
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:31,669
What's the point of having this
thing if I don't get to use it?

385
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:36,061
Leave him!

386
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,487
What are you?

387
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:02,211
You aren't red man
nor quite white ape!

388
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,884
No matter.

389
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,286
You can still bleed like...

390
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,046
Tharks!

391
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,042
Fire!

392
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,251
I surrender.

393
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,922
You may take me captive.

394
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,650
Prepare to turn about!

395
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,369
Did I not tell you he could jump?

396
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,369
Oh, my God.

397
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:53,244
Let go!
Bad dog!

398
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:56,483
You are ugly,
but you are beautiful.

399
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,088
And you fight like a Thark.

400
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,681
You lost your wager.
You must pay.

401
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,908
Jeddak of the Tharks.

402
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,848
I am Dejah Thoris...

403
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:15,771
... regent of the Royal Helium
Academy of Science.

404
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:18,505
- My research vessel...
- Your share of the spoils.

405
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:22,041
- Sola, tend to Virginia's property.
- Yes, my Jeddak!

406
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,322
You know once Sab Than
has conquered us...

407
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,209
... he will turn
his weapon upon you!

408
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:29,967
I know that Zodanga has
found a way to defeat you...

409
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:33,647
... and now you seek a mighty
weapon of your own.

410
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,083
But Virginia fights for us!

411
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:41,368
He will fight the Torquas
in the south.

412
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,027
The Warhoon in the north...

413
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:48,146
... and he will be called
Dotar Sojat...

414
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:49,651
... my right arms!

415
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:52,425
No.

416
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,682
I don't fight for anyone.

417
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:09,243
Virginia, reject this honor...

418
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:13,546
... and I cannot guarantee
the safety of your red girl.

419
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:28,081
I... am...

420
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:32,488
... Dotar Sojat!

421
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,328
To the plunder!

422
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,628
War is a shameful thing.

423
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:15,581
Not when a noble cause is taken up
by those who can make a difference.

424
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,304
You made a difference
today, Virginia.

425
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:25,671
Okay.

426
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,725
See, my name is John Carter.

427
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,403
Virginia is where I'm from.

428
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,129
Where did you learn
to jump that way?

429
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:35,363
I don't know.

430
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,884
How did you learn to fly?

431
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,746
Your ships cannot sail
on light in Virginia?

432
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,450
No, Professor.

433
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,984
See, our ships sail the seas.

434
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,363
Endless water everywhere.

435
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,000
- Skeletal structure normal.
- What are you doing?

436
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,602
Must be the density
of your bones.

437
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,402
- Jump for me.
- Enough!

438
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,887
There will be time
for playfulness later.

439
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,888
I want no playfulness from him.

440
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,300
I want his help.

441
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,209
Explain to me how you do it.

442
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,286
If it's a skill, teach it to Helium.

443
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:24,482
- Name your price.
- I'm not for hire.

444
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:29,111
I've got a cave of gold of my own.

445
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:30,801
Somewhere.

446
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:35,090
Only a madman would rave
about the time of oceans.

447
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,508
Is that your expert view?

448
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,647
- I'm mad?
- Or a liar.

449
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:41,921
She is a good match for you,
Dotar Sojat.

450
00:51:41,990 --> 00:51:43,531
Don't call me that.

451
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,663
There are no seas on the planet.

452
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,725
You said "planet."

453
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,168
Sun, then Rasoom.

454
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,401
Mercury.

455
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:59,162
Then Cosoom.

456
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,587
Venus.

457
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,550
Then Earth... us.

458
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:07,742
That is Jasoom.

459
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:11,410
You are on Barsoom, John Carter.

460
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:14,025
Mars.

461
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,605
I'm on Mars?

462
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:30,443
Good God.

463
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:32,702
I'm on Mars.

464
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:39,230
So, now home is Jasoom...

465
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,562
... and you came on one
of your sailing ships...

466
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,788
... across millions
of karads of empty space?

467
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,551
No.
Not like that.

468
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:51,121
Go on, shock me.
How?

469
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,002
That brought me here.

470
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:05,801
Oh.

471
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:09,361
Well, that explains
everything, then.

472
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,785
- It does?
- Yes.

473
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,866
You're a Thern...

474
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:17,589
... and you simply wish
to return to your rightful place.

475
00:53:17,590 --> 00:53:18,551
Isn't that it?

476
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:19,486
Yes.

477
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,483
Then let's sort this out right now.

478
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:22,808
Come along!

479
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:33,724
Where are you going?

480
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,161
To your temple.

481
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:39,242
No.
No, you cannot enter here.

482
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:42,804
It is forbidden!

483
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,091
You are not Thark!

484
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:47,721
Woola, stay!

485
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:08,825
Dotar Sojat.

486
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,481
It is forbidden.
It is forbidden!

487
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,725
Well, you speak for the Goddess.

488
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:18,851
What does she say?

489
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,804
You called me a Thern.

490
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:25,731
Is that what she is?

491
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:28,646
No, she is Issus.

492
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:31,087
Therns are holy messengers
of the Goddess.

493
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:34,450
In the time of oceans, they
walked among us, guiding us.

494
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:35,901
We must not offend.

495
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,030
Let us go.

496
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:42,248
There's some kind
of writing up there.

497
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,965
- Can you read it?
- It's old scripture.

498
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,508
There it is again.

499
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:05,086
- What's it mean?
- Don't rush me.

500
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,440
"Those who seek
the solace of eternity...

501
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:13,164
... may journey down the river
through the sacred Gates of Iss...

502
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,726
... and find everlasting peace...

503
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,290
... in the bosom of Issus."

504
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:21,642
The Gates of Iss.

505
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,608
What if I could take you there?

506
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,728
What if I didn't trust you?

507
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,382
Then we'd be even.

508
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:46,366
I can take you to the Gates,
to the answers that you seek.

509
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,270
A way back to Jasoom.

510
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,123
- Earth.
- Earth.

511
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:54,120
It's the least I could do to repay
you for getting us out of here.

512
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,891
Assuming that you can.

513
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:05,667
Deal.

514
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:11,082
Go on.

515
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:12,705
You shake it.

516
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:14,127
As a sign of trust.

517
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,045
Good enough.

518
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:28,851
Now all I need to do is get
this medallion off Tars Tarkas.

519
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:31,769
Dotar Sojat?

520
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,568
Useless she-calot.

521
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:39,901
I told you.

522
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:41,549
It is forbidden.

523
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,607
What in the name
of Issus is going on?

524
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:52,205
Issus has been profaned.

525
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:55,045
We found this one and the red
wench plotting in the temple.

526
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,123
In the temple?
How did they get...

527
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,089
Sola led them there.

528
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,248
Sola tried to stop us.

529
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,808
I meant no disrespect
to your goddess, Tars.

530
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,211
I'm just trying to get home.

531
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,567
Your right arms were planning
to rob you of the medallion...

532
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:11,567
... and use it to commit greater
blasphemy down the River Iss.

533
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,642
They must all die in the arena.

534
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,723
How could you do this?
I spared your life.

535
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:22,041
I made you Dotar Sojat
yet her life means nothing to you.

536
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:26,246
You knew... you knew she had
no room for another mark.

537
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:29,729
Now Sola will die
because of you.

538
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:34,385
She's your daughter, isn't she?

539
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,265
Who told you that?

540
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,329
Call it a father's intuition.

541
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:47,403
A Thark has no parent
but the horde.

542
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,091
But how do you know?

543
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,323
Her mother kept her egg...

544
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,410
... and Sola is the last flicker
of her ancient greatness.

545
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,084
You can't just stand here
and let her be killed.

546
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:00,286
Argh!

547
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:04,450
My right arms offend me.
I will cut them off.

548
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:09,645
No.

549
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,207
You must hurry.
I mean to release you.

550
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,442
I make one condition.

551
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:21,844
You take Sola with you
down the River Iss.

552
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,126
My Jeddak.

553
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:26,388
I'd rather you died
in the arms of the Goddess...

554
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:29,066
... than as food
for wild banths in the arena.

555
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,128
Where you go, she goes.

556
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:33,725
What's gonna
happen to you, Tars?

557
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:37,282
Leave a Thark his head and
one hand and he may yet conquer.

558
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,165
Is it done, my Jeddak?

559
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:50,802
Tars Tarkas betrays us.

560
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,026
Woola!

561
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:56,885
You belong to him.

562
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:59,746
Woola would follow you
anywhere on Barsoom.

563
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:02,826
It's three days' ride.
Follow me.

564
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:19,248
What happened to this place?

565
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:21,742
Zodanga happened.

566
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:11,330
Sailing on light.

567
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:16,082
Still playing the madman?

568
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,305
Or the liar.

569
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:36,026
Keep moving!
We'll get there!

570
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:45,586
Why pursue this wedding
any longer? I've already won.

571
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:48,709
Not yet. You must aim past
the horizon, Sab Than.

572
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:53,005
To truly demoralize a nation requires
a public spectacle on the grandest scale.

573
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:56,143
Staging this wedding will ensure
your rule goes unchallenged.

574
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:57,470
If you insist.

575
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:01,525
If you cannot see the wisdom in that,
then we will find another who can.

576
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:18,542
Dotar Sojat.

577
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:21,870
Carter!

578
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:24,708
I do not think
she leads us to the Iss.

579
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:33,348
All right then, Sola.

580
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:34,702
Just play along.

581
01:01:38,180 --> 01:01:40,831
What do you think I'd do once
I saw your city and not some river?

582
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:42,783
- What do you mean?
- Cluros and Thuria.

583
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,390
They should be
at our backs by now.

584
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:47,449
You lead us toward Helium!

585
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:53,443
Once we reach there...

586
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:56,511
... you would see for yourself
the virtue of our cause.

587
01:01:57,860 --> 01:02:01,342
Everyone thinks their cause
is virtuous... Professor.

588
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:03,589
What are you doing?

589
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:09,661
No!

590
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:11,425
John Carter!

591
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:12,950
You can't!

592
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:14,985
I like this plan better.

593
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:16,705
Just wait.

594
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:18,331
She'll come around.

595
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:19,668
You mad fool!

596
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:23,948
You're not from Earth!
There are no Therns!

597
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:27,011
I only told you what you wanted
to hear so you'd get us out!

598
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:28,921
Stop!

599
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:30,301
I can't!

600
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:31,902
I cannot marry him!

601
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:37,826
Can't marry who?

602
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:42,468
The Zodangan Jeddak you fought.

603
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:44,542
Sab Than.

604
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:48,023
He offered a truce to my father
in exchange for my hand.

605
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:49,765
Your father?

606
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:51,930
Tardos Mors.

607
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:55,970
The Jeddak of Helium.
She is a princess!

608
01:02:57,380 --> 01:02:58,870
A princess of Mars.

609
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:00,762
How about that?

610
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:06,345
A princess who didn't want
to get married, so she ran away.

611
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:07,745
No.

612
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:10,685
Is that all there is to the story?

613
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:13,750
No, I didn't run away!

614
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:17,343
- I escaped!
- From what, his breath?

615
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,467
So marry the guy
and save your people.

616
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:22,211
A life of oppression!
That's not living!

617
01:03:32,620 --> 01:03:34,588
If you had the means
to save others...

618
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:37,345
... would you not take any
action possible to make it so?

619
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:41,140
No good will come out
of me fighting your war.

620
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:45,820
I would lay down
my life for Helium.

621
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:53,245
Yes, I ran away.

622
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:55,922
I was afraid...

623
01:03:56,820 --> 01:03:58,185
... weak.

624
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:03,022
Maybe I should have married.

625
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:10,666
But I so feared that it would
somehow be the end of Barsoom.

626
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:18,282
I tell you truly,
John Carter of Earth...

627
01:04:19,820 --> 01:04:21,809
... there are no Gates of Iss.

628
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:24,131
They are not real.

629
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:33,382
I'm sorry, Princess.

630
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:39,226
But this, this is real.

631
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:45,582
And so is my cave of gold.

632
01:04:57,740 --> 01:04:59,788
Prudence demands
you take an escort.

633
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:00,891
No.

634
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:02,462
I go alone, General.

635
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:05,661
But, Jeddak...

636
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:09,062
In one sweep, I can put an end
to 1,000 years of civil war...

637
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:11,268
... and bring Helium
to its knees forever.

638
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:16,569
But my general, in his superior
wisdom, objects. Is that right?

639
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:22,728
I'm starting to talk like you.

640
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:35,388
Hekkador, they have reached the Iss.

641
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:36,950
It took them longer
than I thought.

642
01:05:37,060 --> 01:05:38,107
If they reach the Gates...

643
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:39,286
They can breach the sanctuary.

644
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:41,383
And her knowledge of
the Ninth Ray is already...

645
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:43,303
As advanced as it will ever be.

646
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:44,541
Patience, brothers.

647
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:46,728
It is under my control.

648
01:05:48,060 --> 01:05:49,489
I'm already there.

649
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:05,662
The Iss.

650
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:09,470
Here, pilgrims must leave
behind all they have...

651
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:13,261
... all they know...

652
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:15,105
... never to return.

653
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:20,547
May the Goddess find me worthy.

654
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:29,291
Wait!

655
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:33,701
What do you think
you're doing?

656
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:37,023
It is my way,
Dotar Sojat, not yours.

657
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:40,104
I must honor my Jeddak
and redeem my unworthiness!

658
01:06:40,180 --> 01:06:43,662
You want to honor your father?
Then stay alive and help me.

659
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:48,625
My father?

660
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:52,100
Sola...

661
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:54,762
Why would you say that?

662
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:57,348
That's what drives
your compassion...

663
01:06:57,860 --> 01:07:01,089
... the blood of your father,
Tars Tarkas.

664
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:06,330
And of all the Tharks,
you're the only one worthy of him.

665
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:19,943
And your duty to your father
demands that you see me through.

666
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:24,142
Just help me find the Gates.

667
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:27,311
Then you can decide
what honor requires.

668
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:33,389
Just to the Gates, then.

669
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:38,003
Woola, stay!

670
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:16,062
Other pilgrims.

671
01:08:29,620 --> 01:08:30,960
Professor.

672
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:36,786
Impossible.

673
01:08:43,740 --> 01:08:46,191
I've never seen
this kind of structure before.

674
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:51,130
I want to get a better look.

675
01:09:05,740 --> 01:09:08,186
Carter, your feet.

676
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:02,062
This is not the work of gods.

677
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:05,862
These are machines.

678
01:10:18,860 --> 01:10:20,041
Your medallion.

679
01:10:41,860 --> 01:10:43,208
A spider.

680
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:52,926
Nine.

681
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:55,605
Nine rays.

682
01:10:56,700 --> 01:10:57,740
Nine.

683
01:10:58,020 --> 01:10:59,445
The Ninth Ray is real.

684
01:10:59,620 --> 01:11:00,985
It can be harnessed.
Do you see?

685
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:03,950
This entire structure runs
on Ninth Ray isolates.

686
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:06,208
Mother Issus!

687
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:08,502
Such power.

688
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:12,462
And somehow Zodanga has it.

689
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:18,202
The Therns.

690
01:11:20,140 --> 01:11:21,542
They must be real.

691
01:11:22,660 --> 01:11:24,186
And you...

692
01:11:27,380 --> 01:11:29,787
... are John Carter of Earth?

693
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:32,711
Yes, ma'am.

694
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:39,222
And the ships...

695
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:42,262
... that sail on the sea.

696
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,802
You've seen them.

697
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:50,542
That must be a beautiful sight.

698
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:52,821
It truly is.

699
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:04,241
It's our... solar system.

700
01:12:17,140 --> 01:12:18,904
- What's it say?
- I'm not sure.

701
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:20,584
Okay, what do you think it says?

702
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:24,262
It appears to be a kind
of technical diagram.

703
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:27,486
Here is Barsoom.
There is Jasoom.

704
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:29,560
This glyph here...

705
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:33,665
... it's like our symbol
for a transcription, a copy...

706
01:12:33,860 --> 01:12:37,443
... sent along these lines here,
between the worlds.

707
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,842
- Like...
- A telegram.

708
01:12:41,140 --> 01:12:43,268
You're saying
I was telegraphed here.

709
01:12:44,540 --> 01:12:46,508
I'm a copy of myself.

710
01:12:46,580 --> 01:12:50,671
Possibly, making these words
here the command for travel.

711
01:12:56,140 --> 01:12:57,690
I don't like guessing.

712
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:01,049
I need more information.
I need charts, codices.

713
01:13:02,180 --> 01:13:03,225
Right.

714
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:05,802
And where might we find those?

715
01:13:07,540 --> 01:13:09,242
In the Hall of Science.

716
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:13,008
And where is that?

717
01:13:14,020 --> 01:13:15,010
Helium.

718
01:13:15,740 --> 01:13:19,586
Then quick, let's just head on
and turn on back to Helium.

719
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:23,501
- What do you take me for?
- I take you for a man who's lost.

720
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:26,141
I won't be lost if you just tell me
how to work this thing!

721
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:27,167
I will!

722
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:30,205
But everything I need to understand
that medallion is in Helium.

723
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:33,206
I'm trying to get you back
to your cave of gold.

724
01:13:33,340 --> 01:13:34,805
Isn't that what you want?

725
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:36,046
Yes.

726
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:40,561
No.

727
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:44,022
I don't believe you.

728
01:13:45,540 --> 01:13:48,127
We may have been
born worlds apart...

729
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:52,991
... but I know you, John Carter.

730
01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:57,641
From the moment you
caught me in the sky, I knew.

731
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:03,181
I felt the heart of a man willing
to lay down his life for others.

732
01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:08,011
A man willing to fight for a cause.

733
01:14:09,860 --> 01:14:11,569
Here...

734
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:15,302
... on Barsoom.

735
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:39,647
Don't you see, Carter?

736
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:43,742
I fled to find another way.

737
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:52,627
You are the other way.

738
01:14:55,180 --> 01:14:57,082
Dotar Sojat!

739
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:07,825
Warhoon!

740
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:19,711
Dotar Sojat!

741
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:29,164
Pursue them to the Aoolian Plain.

742
01:15:29,260 --> 01:15:31,830
Then overtake them and
capture the red woman alive.

743
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:33,763
The one who jumps?

744
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:36,308
Let's see what he's capable of.

745
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:27,746
Sarah!

746
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:35,068
- Whoa!
- Dotar Sojat!

747
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:37,566
- What are you doing?
- Sola, get her out of here.

748
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:39,522
Carter!

749
01:16:39,740 --> 01:16:41,663
I was too late once.

750
01:16:41,740 --> 01:16:43,742
I won't be again.

751
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:45,828
No... no!

752
01:16:46,620 --> 01:16:48,463
No!

753
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:50,950
No!

754
01:16:54,620 --> 01:16:55,985
Woola, go.

755
01:16:57,460 --> 01:16:58,700
Go, damn you!

756
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:23,761
Father!

757
01:18:26,780 --> 01:18:28,144
Thank the Goddess!

758
01:18:28,740 --> 01:18:29,901
Carter.

759
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:36,350
Oh, thank Issus.

760
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:37,685
Who is he?

761
01:18:37,940 --> 01:18:40,830
His name's John Carter.
He saved my life.

762
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:45,064
He's from Jasoom.

763
01:18:46,420 --> 01:18:47,581
Jasoom!

764
01:18:48,180 --> 01:18:51,263
Zodanga's closer.
He'll have my personal physician.

765
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:53,984
He shot me out of the sky!

766
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:56,108
Daughter, listen to me!
Listen to me!

767
01:18:56,940 --> 01:18:59,102
Sab has admitted to everything.

768
01:18:59,380 --> 01:19:02,031
He came to me, alone,
without an escort.

769
01:19:02,740 --> 01:19:03,980
I could have
had him imprisoned.

770
01:19:04,060 --> 01:19:05,169
I could have had him killed.

771
01:19:05,380 --> 01:19:08,426
Yet, it was clear he only cared
about your safety.

772
01:19:08,860 --> 01:19:11,004
I feared you'd be tortured
by the Tharks...

773
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:13,104
... and condemned
to die in their arena.

774
01:19:14,540 --> 01:19:16,827
I could not live with that
on my conscience.

775
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:18,565
I do have one, Princess.

776
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:20,421
Really?

777
01:19:20,540 --> 01:19:22,508
I thought you had it
removed along with...

778
01:19:23,860 --> 01:19:25,703
She does not trust me, Jeddak.

779
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:27,050
And why should she?

780
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:30,191
There's never been trust
between Zodanga and Helium.

781
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:31,821
Therefore, Princess...

782
01:19:31,830 --> 01:19:35,024
... I offer you this small
but sincere token of my goodwill.

783
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:43,685
My life.

784
01:19:54,460 --> 01:19:56,462
You hold the power, Princess.

785
01:19:57,380 --> 01:20:01,505
The power of life over me
and over all Barsoom.

786
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:07,190
With our two cities united,
anything is possible.

787
01:20:09,580 --> 01:20:11,569
All you have to do is marry me.

788
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:45,565
Is this Helium?

789
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:47,029
No.

790
01:20:49,780 --> 01:20:54,263
Ah... Zodanga, where the men
are as limited as the menu...

791
01:20:54,860 --> 01:20:57,784
... and the women
are as hard as the beds.

792
01:20:57,900 --> 01:20:59,709
What's your business here?

793
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:01,305
He is my business.

794
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:04,304
The Jasoomian is to be taken
to more secure accommodation.

795
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:07,905
- We've received no such orders!
- You're receiving them now!

796
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:12,004
Straight from the laughing lips
of Sab Than himself.

797
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:19,984
I hear that you are
incredibly dangerous.

798
01:21:20,380 --> 01:21:22,105
Take me hostage.

799
01:21:22,580 --> 01:21:25,347
- What?
- Take me hostage.

800
01:21:27,580 --> 01:21:29,070
Are you all right?

801
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:34,748
No! The white imbecile
has taken my sword!

802
01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:40,266
Guards!

803
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:43,461
Carter!
Run!

804
01:21:43,540 --> 01:21:45,950
There's a crazy man
running amok with a sword!

805
01:21:46,420 --> 01:21:47,521
Carter, this way!

806
01:21:54,020 --> 01:21:55,704
Right, your turn.

807
01:21:55,940 --> 01:21:57,590
- My turn?
- Yeah.

808
01:21:57,820 --> 01:22:00,187
- Who are you?
- My name is Kantos Kan.

809
01:22:00,260 --> 01:22:01,830
I serve Princess Dejah.

810
01:22:01,900 --> 01:22:03,186
- Dejah?
- Uh-huh.

811
01:22:03,260 --> 01:22:08,830
And from what she tells me,
you can get us over there.

812
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:15,945
She said I could make that?

813
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:18,631
We could always surrender.

814
01:22:18,740 --> 01:22:19,707
Quickly!

815
01:22:19,780 --> 01:22:21,982
Is that what you do
on Jasoom, huh?

816
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:23,784
Come on!

817
01:22:41,420 --> 01:22:42,446
Hello, ladies.

818
01:22:54,740 --> 01:22:57,903
You are expected to bow
in my presence, Captain Carter.

819
01:23:01,740 --> 01:23:02,787
Bow.

820
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:09,862
I suppose that will do.

821
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:16,151
- I fetched him, as you commanded.
- Thank you, Kantos.

822
01:23:16,220 --> 01:23:18,591
I wish to speak
to Captain Carter alone.

823
01:23:19,180 --> 01:23:20,711
Keep watch outside.

824
01:23:23,300 --> 01:23:25,402
Now, girls.
Off you go!

825
01:23:39,780 --> 01:23:41,305
You look beautiful.

826
01:23:41,380 --> 01:23:43,428
It's traditional Zodangan.

827
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:45,623
Worn by the groom's mother,
I'm told.

828
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:47,731
A little vulgar for my taste...

829
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:49,702
... but my opinions are about
to become irrelevant.

830
01:23:49,860 --> 01:23:51,862
You can't seriously
be considering this.

831
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:54,301
- What other choice do I have?
- Don't marry him.

832
01:23:54,380 --> 01:23:56,082
Give me a reason not to.

833
01:23:58,180 --> 01:24:00,382
Will you stay and fight
for Helium?

834
01:24:03,060 --> 01:24:06,582
Will you stay and fight
for Helium?

835
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:20,427
Dejah.

836
01:24:21,820 --> 01:24:24,048
We have a saying on Barsoom.

837
01:24:25,740 --> 01:24:30,841
A warrior may change his metal,
but not his heart.

838
01:24:35,420 --> 01:24:36,745
You were right.

839
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:41,363
I could decipher the command.

840
01:24:42,260 --> 01:24:43,825
It's a set of sounds.

841
01:24:44,940 --> 01:24:46,742
A simple phrase.

842
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:49,923
Repeat after me.

843
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:53,663
Ock, ohem, ocktei...

844
01:24:54,020 --> 01:24:55,122
Open the door!

845
01:24:59,380 --> 01:25:02,704
Say it now.
Ock, ohem, ocktei.

846
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:06,046
Are you all right, Dejah?

847
01:25:06,620 --> 01:25:07,621
Ock...

848
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:09,502
... ohem...

849
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:14,468
... ocktei.

850
01:25:14,540 --> 01:25:15,666
Wies.

851
01:25:18,940 --> 01:25:20,942
- Wies.
- Jasoom.

852
01:25:21,140 --> 01:25:22,710
Jasoom, say it.

853
01:25:22,820 --> 01:25:24,788
- Say it. Say it!
- Ja...

854
01:25:26,060 --> 01:25:28,342
Dejah?
Are you alone?

855
01:25:40,460 --> 01:25:41,685
Yes.

856
01:25:44,140 --> 01:25:45,749
I am alone.

857
01:25:51,940 --> 01:25:53,642
Well, my Jeddak.

858
01:25:55,340 --> 01:25:57,142
The moons will soon be rising.

859
01:25:58,980 --> 01:26:01,447
Let us not delay
the proceedings any further.

860
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:05,985
Yes.

861
01:26:07,380 --> 01:26:08,882
Yes, of course.

862
01:26:46,380 --> 01:26:47,905
Ssh.

863
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:51,602
We'll have plenty of time to talk.

864
01:26:56,900 --> 01:26:57,901
Now.

865
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:04,662
Who are you?

866
01:27:05,540 --> 01:27:07,942
- American.
- Who are you, sir?

867
01:27:09,260 --> 01:27:12,311
"Sir."
Definitely the South.

868
01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:15,901
The Carolinas?
Virginia?

869
01:27:17,220 --> 01:27:19,008
It's Virginia, isn't it?

870
01:27:19,260 --> 01:27:21,581
- Lovely place.
- Do you know it?

871
01:27:21,660 --> 01:27:24,909
Not as well as I should.
But I will.

872
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:33,025
Padwar, what's the hold-up?

873
01:27:33,100 --> 01:27:34,909
Sorry, sir.
The streets are blocked.

874
01:27:34,980 --> 01:27:36,266
It's the wedding procession.

875
01:27:40,940 --> 01:27:42,942
Increased strength and agility.

876
01:27:44,620 --> 01:27:46,613
Simple matter of gravitation
and anatomy...

877
01:27:46,620 --> 01:27:48,190
... one we ought to have foreseen.

878
01:27:48,580 --> 01:27:49,545
We?

879
01:27:50,460 --> 01:27:52,781
No apparent increase
in intelligence.

880
01:27:53,620 --> 01:27:57,188
Still, this will not do at all.

881
01:27:57,940 --> 01:28:00,944
We can't have Earthmen
projecting themselves over here...

882
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:03,785
... leaping about, causing
all manner of disruption.

883
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:07,104
You're a Thern.

884
01:28:07,580 --> 01:28:09,582
Therns are a myth.

885
01:28:10,780 --> 01:28:13,906
- Padwar, we'll go on foot.
- Yes, sir.

886
01:28:23,740 --> 01:28:27,806
My name is Matai Shang,
and I do not exist.

887
01:28:28,860 --> 01:28:31,640
Indeed, I work very hard at it.

888
01:28:34,140 --> 01:28:36,984
Excuse me, excuse me.

889
01:28:41,700 --> 01:28:45,583
Many pardons, many pardons.

890
01:29:01,820 --> 01:29:03,265
It's a shame, really.

891
01:29:03,340 --> 01:29:06,722
She's a remarkable creature,
and she came very close indeed.

892
01:29:08,060 --> 01:29:09,625
You mean the Ninth Ray.

893
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:13,702
It's of no consequence now.

894
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:15,824
After tonight's ceremony...

895
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:19,222
... when the two moons meet
and vows are exchanged...

896
01:29:19,660 --> 01:29:22,311
... she and anyone else with
knowledge of the Ninth Ray...

897
01:29:22,380 --> 01:29:24,682
... will be eliminated.

898
01:29:25,140 --> 01:29:27,507
In effect, cutting the head
off the beast.

899
01:29:28,220 --> 01:29:31,590
Quick, clean and precise.

900
01:29:35,540 --> 01:29:37,604
Shame there's no one to warn her.

901
01:29:53,420 --> 01:29:55,722
The balance must be restored.

902
01:30:03,740 --> 01:30:05,829
What gives you
the right to interfere?

903
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,724
What do you care?
This is not your home.

904
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:11,671
You have no obligation
to these people.

905
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:15,801
You don't have a dog
in this fight.

906
01:30:16,100 --> 01:30:18,262
Is that how you would
say it in Virginia?

907
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:20,690
Man without a cause.

908
01:30:30,940 --> 01:30:32,942
So what is your cause?

909
01:30:35,820 --> 01:30:37,222
We have none.

910
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:41,831
We're not haunted
by mortality as you are.

911
01:30:43,460 --> 01:30:46,411
We are eternal.

912
01:30:46,820 --> 01:30:48,609
I don't understand.

913
01:30:48,780 --> 01:30:51,087
The wedding, this little stroll.

914
01:30:51,940 --> 01:30:54,102
Why not just kill me, kill Dejah?

915
01:30:54,180 --> 01:30:57,309
History will follow the course
we have set, Earthman.

916
01:30:58,020 --> 01:31:00,600
And we've chosen
Sab Than to rule next.

917
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:04,262
The Ninth Ray
must remain in the hands...

918
01:31:04,340 --> 01:31:06,661
... of mindless brutes
we can control.

919
01:31:08,660 --> 01:31:12,460
And the infamy of Dejah Thoris's
wedding death will seal his reign.

920
01:31:14,780 --> 01:31:17,989
We've been playing this game
since before the birth of this planet.

921
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:21,428
And we'll continue to do so,
long after the death of yours.

922
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:26,588
We don't cause the destruction
of a world, Captain Carter.

923
01:31:27,580 --> 01:31:29,482
We simply manage it...

924
01:31:30,340 --> 01:31:32,342
... feed off it, if you like.

925
01:31:33,940 --> 01:31:37,461
But on every host planet, it always
plays out exactly the same way.

926
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:42,706
Populations rise,
societies divide...

927
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:45,702
... wars spread.

928
01:31:47,180 --> 01:31:49,182
And all the while...

929
01:31:49,980 --> 01:31:52,731
... the neglected planet
slowly fades.

930
01:32:00,660 --> 01:32:03,973
Prep a two-man flier immediately,
for prisoner transport.

931
01:32:03,980 --> 01:32:04,909
Yes, sir.

932
01:32:16,060 --> 01:32:17,221
Argh!

933
01:32:22,140 --> 01:32:23,580
Immortal ain't bulletproof.

934
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:26,004
I shot one of you back on Earth.

935
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:33,804
Oh, come on.

936
01:32:39,580 --> 01:32:42,181
I'm trying!
I'm trying!

937
01:32:42,460 --> 01:32:44,322
Guards, after him!

938
01:33:53,860 --> 01:33:55,262
Ohh... Woola!

939
01:33:56,180 --> 01:33:58,886
I told you Woola would
follow you anywhere.

940
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:02,262
He did a lot more than just that.

941
01:34:05,300 --> 01:34:06,984
Wait... wait!

942
01:34:07,060 --> 01:34:08,664
Where are you going?

943
01:34:08,780 --> 01:34:09,830
To save Dejah.

944
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:11,926
And I'll need an army to do it.

945
01:34:13,180 --> 01:34:13,986
Get on.

946
01:34:15,220 --> 01:34:18,105
No!
Tharks do not fly.

947
01:34:40,420 --> 01:34:41,404
Gayor.

948
01:34:51,420 --> 01:34:53,024
Tars!
They're going to kill...

949
01:34:55,260 --> 01:34:56,546
Dejah.

950
01:34:56,860 --> 01:34:59,611
Issus truly rewards the just.

951
01:35:13,780 --> 01:35:15,709
- I see the dead.
- Tars?

952
01:35:18,580 --> 01:35:20,582
The Virginia I knew...

953
01:35:22,260 --> 01:35:24,062
... traveled the Iss.

954
01:35:26,420 --> 01:35:27,821
What have they done to you?

955
01:35:28,660 --> 01:35:30,662
Tal challenged.

956
01:35:31,380 --> 01:35:32,641
I lost.

957
01:35:34,700 --> 01:35:36,304
Virginia.

958
01:35:37,420 --> 01:35:40,264
When I saw you
leap into the sky...

959
01:35:41,100 --> 01:35:44,284
... I wished to believe
it was a sign...

960
01:35:44,340 --> 01:35:47,310
... that something new
can come into this world.

961
01:35:48,140 --> 01:35:53,267
That the greatness of our
Thark race might rise again.

962
01:35:54,740 --> 01:35:57,307
But it is too late.

963
01:35:59,380 --> 01:36:01,382
- Tars.
- No matter.

964
01:36:02,140 --> 01:36:04,686
My daughter is with
her mother in Paradise.

965
01:36:04,860 --> 01:36:06,662
There is comfort in that.

966
01:36:09,380 --> 01:36:12,206
Tars, it's Sola.

967
01:36:14,580 --> 01:36:16,682
Actually, she's here with me.

968
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:17,901
Argh!

969
01:36:22,060 --> 01:36:25,621
This is how you repay
your debt to me?

970
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:27,031
I need my sword.

971
01:36:27,100 --> 01:36:30,429
Then it would harvest your
thoughtless head from your body!

972
01:36:44,060 --> 01:36:46,062
Up now!
We go!

973
01:36:50,900 --> 01:36:52,529
It is done.

974
01:36:52,700 --> 01:36:53,845
Nonsense.

975
01:36:54,260 --> 01:36:57,928
"Leave a Thark his head and
one hand, and he may yet conquer."

976
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,045
Right?

977
01:36:59,220 --> 01:37:01,222
Your spirit annoys me.

978
01:37:18,620 --> 01:37:20,051
All this your work?

979
01:37:20,700 --> 01:37:21,845
Banths.

980
01:37:29,380 --> 01:37:30,445
Weakness.

981
01:37:30,820 --> 01:37:31,988
Sentiment.

982
01:37:32,860 --> 01:37:37,702
Allowing this white worm
to contaminate the horde.

983
01:37:38,580 --> 01:37:41,943
These are the crimes
of Tars Tarkas.

984
01:37:43,620 --> 01:37:47,129
We are united
because we cull our freaks.

985
01:37:48,140 --> 01:37:51,962
We are strong
because we despise weakness.

986
01:37:57,380 --> 01:38:01,988
Let them be crushed
like unhatched eggs.

987
01:38:19,300 --> 01:38:20,829
Is that a banth?

988
01:38:21,180 --> 01:38:22,111
No.

989
01:38:22,580 --> 01:38:24,309
It is a white ape.

990
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:27,822
Run!

991
01:38:30,580 --> 01:38:33,231
Tars! Get up!
Tars!

992
01:38:33,300 --> 01:38:35,143
Give me your hand!
You have four damn hands!

993
01:38:35,220 --> 01:38:36,381
Give me one!

994
01:38:40,540 --> 01:38:42,542
- Father!
- Father?

995
01:38:46,980 --> 01:38:48,909
Tars... Tars!

996
01:38:49,540 --> 01:38:50,746
Hey!

997
01:38:52,300 --> 01:38:55,782
Hey! Hey, over here,
you blind monkey!

998
01:39:14,780 --> 01:39:16,528
Release the other one.

999
01:39:34,260 --> 01:39:38,406
Watch your father die
like the whimpering calot he is!

1000
01:39:40,180 --> 01:39:42,521
No!
Let us watch you!

1001
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:53,820
Sola, are you mad?

1002
01:39:53,940 --> 01:39:56,625
No.
The blood of my father drives me.

1003
01:40:51,100 --> 01:40:52,147
Sola!

1004
01:41:17,420 --> 01:41:27,424
Virginia! Virginia!
Virginia! Virginia!

1005
01:41:32,940 --> 01:41:35,725
I claim the right of challenge!

1006
01:41:42,180 --> 01:41:44,248
You have no right to challenge!

1007
01:41:44,300 --> 01:41:46,070
You are not Thark!

1008
01:41:46,700 --> 01:41:48,702
He is Thark!

1009
01:41:48,780 --> 01:41:51,426
He is Dotar Sojat!

1010
01:41:51,700 --> 01:41:56,069
Dotar Sojat!
Dotar Sojat!

1011
01:41:56,460 --> 01:42:04,006
Dotar Sojat!
Dotar Sojat!

1012
01:42:04,140 --> 01:42:06,541
Who will pledge
their metal to mine?

1013
01:42:41,380 --> 01:42:45,844
The Jeddak of Zodanga means
to crush Helium this very night.

1014
01:42:46,020 --> 01:42:48,022
And if Helium falls...

1015
01:42:49,780 --> 01:42:51,782
... so does Barsoom.

1016
01:42:52,340 --> 01:42:55,384
We must throw off
the yoke of old hatreds.

1017
01:42:56,180 --> 01:42:58,323
Tharks did not cause this.

1018
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:02,749
But by Issus, Tharks will end it!

1019
01:43:06,940 --> 01:43:09,022
We ride for Zodanga!

1020
01:43:33,140 --> 01:43:36,683
I know that this is not the fate you
would have chosen for yourself...

1021
01:43:36,900 --> 01:43:38,645
... or for Helium...

1022
01:43:38,820 --> 01:43:42,520
... but choice is a luxury
even for a Jeddak of Barsoom.

1023
01:43:43,740 --> 01:43:47,782
- Even if, in your heart...
- A heart is a luxury.

1024
01:43:51,580 --> 01:43:52,770
Steady.

1025
01:43:55,740 --> 01:43:57,742
Remember, she is not the prize.

1026
01:44:00,020 --> 01:44:02,022
The prize is Barsoom.

1027
01:44:23,860 --> 01:44:24,746
You!

1028
01:44:25,020 --> 01:44:28,785
Why is Zodanga undefended?
Where is everyone?

1029
01:44:28,860 --> 01:44:31,386
The army has been repositioned
outside Helium.

1030
01:44:31,460 --> 01:44:33,269
Only a small contingent remains.

1031
01:44:33,340 --> 01:44:35,468
Sab and Dejah Thoris.
Where are they?

1032
01:44:36,140 --> 01:44:38,661
They're at the wedding,
in Helium!

1033
01:44:38,740 --> 01:44:40,265
Helium?

1034
01:45:00,140 --> 01:45:02,427
No!
I have made my decision.

1035
01:45:02,540 --> 01:45:04,169
It's the only way
to get there in time.

1036
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:07,001
Tharks do not fly.

1037
01:45:08,660 --> 01:45:09,991
So be it.

1038
01:45:15,580 --> 01:45:18,584
This is madness, Dotar Sojat.
You'll die!

1039
01:45:21,340 --> 01:45:23,402
Then I'll see you
down the River Iss.

1040
01:45:24,820 --> 01:45:26,788
Follow the canal!

1041
01:45:26,860 --> 01:45:29,943
Be careful! The moonlight
will force you to fly low!

1042
01:45:40,780 --> 01:45:43,631
Like our ancestors before us...

1043
01:45:43,940 --> 01:45:48,907
... we gather under the mingled
light of Barsoom's first lovers...

1044
01:45:49,220 --> 01:45:52,066
... Cluros and Thuria.

1045
01:46:16,020 --> 01:46:19,229
As the moons are joined
in celestial union...

1046
01:46:19,300 --> 01:46:23,983
... so do we unite
Sab Than and Dejah Thoris...

1047
01:46:24,340 --> 01:46:27,305
... Zodanga and Helium.

1048
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:44,008
No! You'll raise the alarm.
It's one of ours.

1049
01:46:53,980 --> 01:46:55,505
In the time of oceans...

1050
01:46:55,580 --> 01:46:58,948
... the celestial lovers
rose from the sea each night...

1051
01:46:59,020 --> 01:47:01,288
... to consummate
their love in the sky.

1052
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:04,722
Drink now of this holy water
and be wed.

1053
01:47:04,900 --> 01:47:06,348
So may it be again.

1054
01:47:07,940 --> 01:47:09,842
I am yours forever.

1055
01:47:17,020 --> 01:47:19,022
And I am yours...

1056
01:47:21,180 --> 01:47:22,506
... forever.

1057
01:47:28,340 --> 01:47:29,346
Carter!

1058
01:47:31,340 --> 01:47:33,622
It's a trap!
Zodanga's at your walls!

1059
01:47:33,700 --> 01:47:34,865
Now!
Do it now!

1060
01:47:35,180 --> 01:47:37,847
- No!
- Helium falls!

1061
01:47:54,380 --> 01:47:57,089
Zodanga!

1062
01:48:12,300 --> 01:48:13,201
Dejah!

1063
01:48:14,420 --> 01:48:15,401
Argh!

1064
01:48:22,180 --> 01:48:24,064
If you'll just get behind me, sir.

1065
01:48:30,260 --> 01:48:31,350
Carter!

1066
01:48:45,020 --> 01:48:47,587
- It was such a nice wedding.
- Yeah, that.

1067
01:48:58,060 --> 01:49:01,910
- Helium's fate is sealed, Earthman.
- As is yours.

1068
01:49:10,580 --> 01:49:12,682
Thank the Goddess
that's over with.

1069
01:49:21,420 --> 01:49:22,545
Virginia!

1070
01:49:28,660 --> 01:49:30,144
It is good to fly!

1071
01:49:34,620 --> 01:49:36,588
By Issus, they fight with us!

1072
01:49:54,940 --> 01:49:55,841
Brother!

1073
01:49:56,020 --> 01:49:58,022
Heliumite, huh?

1074
01:50:15,300 --> 01:50:17,727
You're going to tell me everything
you know about the Therns.

1075
01:50:17,740 --> 01:50:20,710
You spare me and I'll tell you.

1076
01:50:51,340 --> 01:50:55,764
A fitting solution for your setback,
wouldn't you say, Captain?

1077
01:50:56,920 --> 01:50:58,590
Dejah Thoris survives
her assassins...

1078
01:50:58,660 --> 01:51:02,042
... but will fail to prove her
misguided theory of the Ninth Ray.

1079
01:51:02,420 --> 01:51:03,351
Yes.

1080
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:06,502
I'll enjoy playing that out.

1081
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:08,086
Carter!

1082
01:51:11,660 --> 01:51:12,300
Dejah!

1083
01:51:14,860 --> 01:51:16,271
I'm getting away!

1084
01:51:31,580 --> 01:51:32,561
Tars.

1085
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:34,450
The medallion.

1086
01:51:34,900 --> 01:51:36,884
Give it to me, my Jeddak.

1087
01:51:44,420 --> 01:51:45,346
No!

1088
01:52:05,260 --> 01:52:06,964
I'll explain later.

1089
01:52:13,900 --> 01:52:16,965
You have won, my Jeddak.

1090
01:52:19,100 --> 01:52:20,709
All is finished.

1091
01:52:25,580 --> 01:52:26,870
Not quite.

1092
01:52:35,980 --> 01:52:37,005
A Jeddak.

1093
01:52:37,620 --> 01:52:39,722
I see you have
changed your metal.

1094
01:52:41,940 --> 01:52:43,510
And my heart.

1095
01:52:53,980 --> 01:52:55,870
Dejah Thoris...

1096
01:52:58,620 --> 01:53:01,664
... would a princess of Mars
ever consider marriage...

1097
01:53:01,740 --> 01:53:05,381
... to a wayward
Virginia cavalryman...

1098
01:53:08,340 --> 01:53:09,815
... with nothing to offer?

1099
01:53:09,820 --> 01:53:11,026
Yes...

1100
01:53:13,060 --> 01:53:15,062
... John Carter.

1101
01:53:16,180 --> 01:53:17,466
Yes!

1102
01:53:26,180 --> 01:53:29,304
By the ancient rite
of moons and water...

1103
01:53:30,540 --> 01:53:32,542
... are you bound together...

1104
01:53:34,500 --> 01:53:36,502
... husband and wife.

1105
01:54:02,620 --> 01:54:03,722
John?

1106
01:54:26,900 --> 01:54:29,062
Homesick for the Thark nursery?

1107
01:54:30,540 --> 01:54:32,822
I'm sorry.
I couldn't sleep.

1108
01:54:34,220 --> 01:54:36,422
I had that feeling you get,
suddenly...

1109
01:54:37,980 --> 01:54:41,004
... that you left a light burning...

1110
01:54:43,260 --> 01:54:45,388
... or a door open.

1111
01:54:51,640 --> 01:54:52,922
Go back to bed.

1112
01:54:53,620 --> 01:54:55,348
I won't be long.

1113
01:55:03,780 --> 01:55:06,028
Be back in one xat...

1114
01:55:06,540 --> 01:55:08,622
... John Carter of Earth.

1115
01:55:24,400 --> 01:55:25,402
Come.

1116
01:55:56,820 --> 01:55:59,022
John Carter of Earth.

1117
01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:13,540
Yup.

1118
01:56:15,540 --> 01:56:19,770
John Carter of Mars
sounds much better.

1119
01:56:25,060 --> 01:56:28,667
Sire, I must express the deepest
of gratitude for saving Helium.

1120
01:56:28,740 --> 01:56:30,708
Please.
The honor is mine.

1121
01:56:30,820 --> 01:56:33,161
Fair enough, Earthman.
Now it's your move.

1122
01:56:33,260 --> 01:56:36,025
Ock ohem ocktei wies Jasoom.

1123
01:56:55,540 --> 01:56:57,522
No... no.

1124
01:57:00,100 --> 01:57:01,143
No.

1125
01:57:02,500 --> 01:57:03,586
Powell?

1126
01:57:13,060 --> 01:57:13,986
No!

1127
01:57:26,220 --> 01:57:31,267
Ock ohem ocktei wies Barsoom.

1128
01:57:32,140 --> 01:57:36,882
Ock ohem ocktei wies Barsoom.

1129
01:57:42,620 --> 01:57:45,730
Bars... Barsoom.

1130
01:57:50,740 --> 01:57:54,970
50 million miles apart
and no way to bridge the gap.

1131
01:57:54,980 --> 01:57:58,527
No way to return my body
and my soul to their true home.

1132
01:57:59,340 --> 01:58:02,284
Like a fool, I had thrown
away my medallion.

1133
01:58:04,940 --> 01:58:07,088
Then I recalled Matai Shang.

1134
01:58:07,100 --> 01:58:09,580
His knowledge of Earth,
of my history.

1135
01:58:09,780 --> 01:58:12,191
It meant Therns were
a presence on this world.

1136
01:58:12,260 --> 01:58:14,203
The cave in Arizona was proof.

1137
01:58:15,140 --> 01:58:17,955
There might be other such proofs,
other Thern way stations...

1138
01:58:17,980 --> 01:58:19,823
... hidden all around the world.

1139
01:58:19,940 --> 01:58:23,183
I knew now what the cave
of gold must be used for.

1140
01:58:23,460 --> 01:58:26,304
So for ten bitter years, I searched.

1141
01:58:26,460 --> 01:58:28,210
On the trail of rumor and legend...

1142
01:58:28,320 --> 01:58:31,424
... I ferreted out every possible
evidence of the Therns...

1143
01:58:31,500 --> 01:58:33,489
... but I found no medallion.

1144
01:58:35,340 --> 01:58:38,644
And then... it came to me.

1145
01:58:44,580 --> 01:58:45,911
I've got it!

1146
01:58:46,900 --> 01:58:48,384
I've found it!

1147
01:58:56,940 --> 01:58:59,172
And once it came,
there were many plans...

1148
01:58:59,180 --> 01:59:00,869
... I had to make in secret.

1149
01:59:01,140 --> 01:59:03,268
I could trust no one else.

1150
01:59:03,660 --> 01:59:07,784
I had long suspected that the Therns
were following my movements.

1151
01:59:14,660 --> 01:59:15,862
Sir.

1152
01:59:16,780 --> 01:59:19,221
I feel remarkably unwell,
Thompson.

1153
01:59:20,020 --> 01:59:23,183
- Please send for the doctor.
- Yes, sir.

1154
01:59:23,340 --> 01:59:24,842
And, Thompson...

1155
01:59:26,640 --> 01:59:28,408
... my attorney as well.

1156
01:59:30,060 --> 01:59:31,710
Of course, sir.

1157
01:59:37,700 --> 01:59:40,704
Now you will understand
the cause of my sudden death.

1158
01:59:46,540 --> 01:59:49,584
The reason for my bizarre
funeral instructions.

1159
01:59:52,900 --> 01:59:56,886
Why the door can only
be opened from the inside.

1160
01:59:58,340 --> 02:00:03,646
For if my body dies on Earth,
then my copy dies on Mars.

1161
02:00:05,540 --> 02:00:07,026
You are the key.

1162
02:00:07,100 --> 02:00:10,243
This is the task I entrust to you
along with all my fortune.

1163
02:00:10,320 --> 02:00:13,463
Protect my body. The Therns
will attempt to destroy it.

1164
02:00:13,540 --> 02:00:15,602
In the time it has taken you
to read these pages...

1165
02:00:15,620 --> 02:00:17,362
... they may have
already done so.

1166
02:00:26,220 --> 02:00:28,022
I am the key.
I am the key.

1167
02:00:28,300 --> 02:00:30,462
I, Edgar...

1168
02:00:32,260 --> 02:00:34,262
Ed... Ed...

1169
02:00:34,420 --> 02:00:36,222
E... D...

1170
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:37,831
Ed!

1171
02:00:38,100 --> 02:00:39,228
It should work!

1172
02:00:50,100 --> 02:00:51,909
Dear Ned.

1173
02:00:53,940 --> 02:00:55,542
You sneaky devil!

1174
02:00:56,060 --> 02:00:59,587
You never called me Edgar!
You... you called me Ned!

1175
02:01:21,380 --> 02:01:22,366
Hello, Ned.

1176
02:01:27,180 --> 02:01:30,354
Toxin.
Derived from the puffer fish.

1177
02:01:30,360 --> 02:01:31,749
Simulates death.

1178
02:01:38,140 --> 02:01:39,708
You never found the medallion.

1179
02:01:40,900 --> 02:01:41,866
No.

1180
02:01:42,820 --> 02:01:45,603
That's why I'm so grateful
to you for bringing me one.

1181
02:01:47,500 --> 02:01:50,882
I... I was just bait?

1182
02:01:51,140 --> 02:01:54,608
No.
You're far more than that.

1183
02:01:54,820 --> 02:01:56,948
I really do need a protector.

1184
02:01:58,980 --> 02:02:01,087
That is, if you're willing.

1185
02:02:09,900 --> 02:02:11,211
Goodbye, Ned.

1186
02:02:15,860 --> 02:02:17,588
Oh, and, Ned...

1187
02:02:19,020 --> 02:02:22,368
Take up a cause.
Fall in love.

1188
02:02:22,940 --> 02:02:24,144
Write a book.

1189
02:02:26,340 --> 02:02:28,188
It's time I went home.

1190
02:02:39,540 --> 02:02:46,924
Ock ohem ocktei wies...

1191
02:02:48,460 --> 02:02:49,982
Barsoom.

1192
02:02:50,660 --> 02:02:51,782
... Barsoom.
