1
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:23,912
I go to the darkness of the white forest's spring

2
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:32,761
To rid myself of memories

3
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:40,571
Many bitter fruits of the silverberry

4
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:48,376
And the sad fruit of the kusupia

5
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:58,617
In the garden full of black flowers

6
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:08,365
As my tears flow

7
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:17,501
It is these I must eat

8
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:47,033
A Tree of Palme

9
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:54,442

24
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:05,243
There she is!

25
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:01,527
What happened? Where did she go?

26
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,608
Bola!

27
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:12,435
Hey, come on!

28
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:30,395
Did you see her?! She's a fiend!

29
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:33,764
She's been up to The Roof... to Touto and back.

30
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:38,259
To think this Sol Tribe warrior was a woman...

31
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:35,942
It's Palme, I'll bet...

32
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:39,608
He's woken up?

33
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:51,190
How many years has he been silent?

34
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:54,423
I'm an old man now...

35
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,170
so obsessed with a sap that doesn't exist...

36
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:00,434
I've lost track of time.

37
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,205
A niger triggerfish!

38
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,183
He's after it again!

39
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:35,872
Baron! There's going to be lightning!

40
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:58,189
No, Xian!

41
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,324
That's not crosskahla!

42
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:02,793
It's a stone! It's just a stone!

43
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:04,620
Snap out of it, Xian!

44
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:06,196
Xian!

45
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,672
No, Palme!

46
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:48,534
Silent once again...

47
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:10,762
You're made from kooloop wood.

48
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:16,168
Without your oil, you'll put down roots
just standing in the sun...

49
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:18,329
like the trees out back.

50
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:22,808
I have no problem with you
turning back into a tree,

51
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:26,744
but since I can't erase your memory...

52
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,440
I'm not certain what effect that would have.

53
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:37,654
The kooloop tree thrives on the
particles of memory it draws up

54
00:12:37,689 --> 00:12:42,723
from the remains of ancient
civilizations buried in the soil.

55
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:47,223
What kind of grotesque monster
would you become?

56
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:01,179
Xian!

57
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:02,981
Xian!

58
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:07,886
I found it! Look, I found it!

59
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,051
A crow-snake egg?

60
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:16,319
Wow, a crow-snake egg... where did you find it?

61
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:20,927
At the Pointed Rocks, just like you said!

62
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,537
Let's go there again when you get better.

63
00:13:24,572 --> 00:13:26,103
It was very strange...

64
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,573
Look! I brought you kusupia flowers
and berries! Bunches of them!!
It was very strange...

65
00:13:27,608 --> 00:13:30,167
Look! I brought you kusupia flowers
and berries! Bunches of them!!

66
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:38,551
When you were feeling blue,
Palme was out picking flowers,

67
00:13:38,586 --> 00:13:43,045
making your meals, and running
around full of energy.

68
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,756
Wasn't he, Xian?

69
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,664
Xian!

70
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:33,264
Ring...

71
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:37,406
Ring-a-ling...

72
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:58,896
Ring...

73
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:03,799
Ring-a-ling...

74
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:13,443
But the moment you died,
he just stopped functioning.

75
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:22,520
Xian!

76
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,121
Here we go again...

77
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:45,405
Xian... Xian...

78
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:47,445
Palme!

79
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:49,771
Xian...

80
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,988
Is that an egg, Xian?

81
00:15:56,023 --> 00:15:58,957
Palme's talking!

82
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:03,319
What kind of an egg? I'll take good care of it.

83
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,890
Wh-who are you? What are
you doing in my house?

84
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:09,932
Koram. From Tamas.

85
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:12,786
Tamas? You're from Below?!

86
00:16:12,821 --> 00:16:15,236
Wh-What are you doing here?!

87
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:20,442
I want the Egg of Touto delivered to Tamas.

88
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:25,344
Take this sap. It will keep the egg alive.

89
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:29,376
Don't talk nonsense! To go Below...

90
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,263
Look!

91
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:41,133
The light of crosskahla?!

92
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:42,600
It's her!

93
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:45,496
Th-This is...

94
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:47,496
Crosskahla.

95
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:51,574
What? Crosskahla?! I don't believe it!

96
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:56,582
Xian... Xian spent her life searching for that sap!

97
00:16:56,617 --> 00:16:58,413
Xian...

98
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:06,218
It makes the same sound as the
pendant you made to imitate it.

99
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,460
Let's go to the Pointed Rocks.

100
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,000
Xian!

101
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:21,438
Where did you get this? Does it
still exist down Below?

102
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,947
In that condition, where could she have gone?

103
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,421
"The Egg of Touto"...

104
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:51,836
"The Egg of the Roof?" What could that mean?

105
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,323
Keep it down, will you? My boy's asleep.

106
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:12,790
Move, old man!

107
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:25,035
You old drunk!

108
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,231
Wake up, boy! C'mon!

109
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,136
What the hell?

110
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:36,514
It's a puppet!

111
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,383
Palme! My dear Palme!

112
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:40,552
This guy's giving me the creeps.
Palme! My dear Palme!

113
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:41,576
This guy's giving me the creeps.

114
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:45,917
A Sol Tribe bag!

115
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:48,727
It was caught on the cliffs out back.

116
00:18:48,762 --> 00:18:49,827
Where's the egg?

117
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:50,229
Gone, of course.
Where's the egg?

118
00:18:50,264 --> 00:18:50,928
Gone, of course.

119
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:51,363
Gone, of course.
Drat!

120
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:52,421
Drat!

121
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:54,331
Where's the bola pointing?

122
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:57,631
I don't know. It's not reacting.

123
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:24,129
The crosskahla has the power
of the sun that travels

124
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:26,757
across the roof of all Arcana.

125
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:30,302
It will awaken your dormant functions

126
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:32,402
and allow you to stay alive.

127
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:36,635
It's the sap I've been looking for, but
it doesn't matter anymore.

128
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:42,846
You chase after the niger triggerfish

129
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:47,750
and call that woman "Xian"
because you want to live.

130
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:50,183
I can't stop you now.

131
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:55,516
Listen to me, Palme. Deliver this for her.

132
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:57,963
Go and find your lost sense of purpose...

133
00:19:57,998 --> 00:20:02,299
for her sake and for yours.

134
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:05,861
This is the life force she gave you.

135
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:13,843
Xian... what more could I possibly do?

136
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:19,318
Listen up! Try not to get too much sun.

137
00:20:19,353 --> 00:20:23,687
And visit Cote Ploire someday.

138
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:29,490
Xian always wanted you to see the
beautiful city she came from.

139
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:35,327
Wake up, Palme! Open your eyes! Open them...

140
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:52,275
Go Below, Palme!

141
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:59,545
"Palme?"

142
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:18,162
Go to Tamas, Palme!

143
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:21,102
"Tamas?"

144
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:47,588
Bolas! Stay real quiet!

145
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,960
They give me the creeps!

146
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:28,326
They'd be downright bad luck if they
smelled of death. Scary!

147
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:09,100
Hey! Out of the way or I'll run you over!

148
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:17,248
It's Jamji!

149
00:25:17,283 --> 00:25:18,682
Here he comes!

150
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:38,233
What the hell are you doing? Move! Move!

151
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:42,164
Of all the luck!

152
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:45,442
Out of the way! I can't get through!

153
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:49,140
Don't touch! I won't allow you to steal them!

154
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:50,847
Wow!

155
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,543
More locks every time!

156
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,787
Damn! I'll give Roualt the signal!

157
00:25:55,822 --> 00:25:58,551
Damn you! Ow!

158
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,488
Pu's giving us the signal. Roualt!

159
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:13,104
How long does he intend to keep doing this?

160
00:26:13,139 --> 00:26:15,902
What's Shatta thinking?

161
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:19,042
Stop complaining!

162
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:21,875
I'm saying it's childish! Here goes!

163
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:36,560
We're getting you out. Stay back.

164
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:52,443
Uh-oh!

165
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:55,379
He missed!

166
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:14,332
He won't be selling kids for a while!

167
00:27:14,367 --> 00:27:15,765
Serves him right!

168
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:19,002
Come on!

169
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:38,856
Huh?

170
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:50,431
Hey! Quit dawdling or you'll get lost.

171
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:52,369
Did you hear me?

172
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:18,763
Forget that! Go home and
you'll get sold off again.

173
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:21,163
Parents are worthless.

174
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:26,787
We're going to knock over the Boss of this town

175
00:28:26,822 --> 00:28:30,541
and take Flamingo over.
We've got big plans, see?

176
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:33,743
For that we need money.

177
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:37,816
We'll buy a kooloop tree and get rich off the oil!

178
00:28:37,851 --> 00:28:39,374
Not so fast, Roualt...

179
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:41,584
Shatta!

180
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:44,084
The night patrol returns!

181
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:47,318
What a great haul!

182
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:53,230
Roualt, there's a trader at Gyariko's.

183
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:57,233
Darumaya? Great!

184
00:28:57,268 --> 00:29:01,051
It's been a while since we've been able
to see Gyariko's treasures.

185
00:29:01,086 --> 00:29:04,834
That slug only opens his warehouse when
she comes, so we gotta hurry!

186
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:18,284
Where were you, Pu? Hey, a crow-snake!

187
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:22,156
Come here! Where did you come from?

188
00:29:22,191 --> 00:29:25,622
It's his. It goes wherever he does.

189
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:27,297
Who?

190
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:28,032
He says his name's Palme.
Who?

191
00:29:28,067 --> 00:29:28,862
He says his name's Palme.

192
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:30,233
One of those kids we rescued?

193
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:30,735
He's slow and completely useless.
One of those kids we rescued?

194
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,293
He's slow and completely useless.

195
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:37,871
Palme! Don't you have somewhere you need
to be? You'd better get going!

196
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:43,848
He kind of looks like us... Where are you from?

197
00:29:43,883 --> 00:29:45,372
Stop it, Mu!

198
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:47,517
"Mu..."

199
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:47,752
If you pay attention to him, he'll
never leave you alone.
"Mu..."

200
00:29:47,787 --> 00:29:50,778
If you pay attention to him, he'll
never leave you alone.

201
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:52,556
We're going to Gyariko's.

202
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:55,392
A new guy?

203
00:29:58,263 --> 00:30:01,331
Hey! Isn't this cool!

204
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:03,067
Let me have it. C'mon, what do you say?

205
00:30:03,102 --> 00:30:06,195
Cut it out, Roualt! It's his!

206
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:08,872
Who cares?

207
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:12,410
In exchange we'll let him join
our gang, right, Pu?

208
00:30:12,445 --> 00:30:13,943
Join our gang?!

209
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,776
Take care of him. Let's go!

210
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,284
"Pu..."

211
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,532
What are you sulking about?!

212
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:42,503
And no playing cute!

213
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:51,381
Hello, Gyariko! How are you? It's Darumaya.

214
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,911
Don't just stand there, get in here!

215
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,163
Look! Gyariko's opened up his warehouse!

216
00:31:05,198 --> 00:31:06,630
Wow!

217
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:11,703
Oh, you're such a tease, Gyariko!

218
00:31:11,738 --> 00:31:13,170
It's true!

219
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:17,800
I was there all the time!

220
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:22,942
When Gala danced, every man
in town would be there.

221
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:28,953
They were all so infatuated with you,
no one would do any work!

222
00:31:28,988 --> 00:31:31,080
That was years ago.

223
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:34,155
You dimwit! You need to show
him those items too!

224
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,091
Where'd he go?!

225
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:52,572
It's been a while since the last time I saw you...

226
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:57,346
You've grown into quite a
beautiful girl, haven't you?

227
00:31:58,449 --> 00:32:03,079
Oh, that's right! I've got a present for you.

228
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:12,096
A tailor from Kumochi Forest
brought it. It's very beautiful.

229
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:16,701
If Gala had worn it, it would've
suited her perfectly.

230
00:32:16,736 --> 00:32:18,259
Look!

231
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:33,017
What's wrong? Don't you like it?

232
00:32:33,052 --> 00:32:34,317
It's a little big,

233
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:39,187
but soon you'll be as lovely as your mother.

234
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:43,082
Look! Isn't it beautiful?

235
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:45,862
Listen, Palme...

236
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:49,500
to survive in this town, you've got to listen to me.

237
00:32:49,535 --> 00:32:51,092
It's for your own good!

238
00:32:55,606 --> 00:33:07,643
To the fountain of the white forest...

239
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:15,922
What are you doing?!

240
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:21,623
Oh, no!

241
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:30,296
Well, well! What have we here?
Who gave you this?

242
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:37,370
You don't have to tell me. But next time
I hope you accept my gift too.

243
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:42,719
Ow! Settle down, Palme!

244
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:44,088
Don't worry! We'll get it back for you later!
Ow! Settle down, Palme!

245
00:33:44,123 --> 00:33:46,591
Don't worry! We'll get it back for you later!

246
00:33:46,626 --> 00:33:48,424
What's going on?!

247
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:50,294
Pu dropped his pendant!

248
00:33:50,329 --> 00:33:52,095
'Cause he's such a goof!

249
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,332
This place is hardly ever open!

250
00:33:54,367 --> 00:33:55,799
Ow!

251
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,166
R-Roualt!

252
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:09,980
Roualt!

253
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:15,418
Stop it, Roualt!

254
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:17,053
Damn it! Let go of me!

255
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:17,488
Grab him!
Damn it! Let go of me!

256
00:34:17,523 --> 00:34:17,653
Grab him!

257
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:18,589
Grab him!
Take it easy, Roualt!

258
00:34:18,624 --> 00:34:19,223
Take it easy, Roualt!

259
00:34:19,258 --> 00:34:20,690
Shut up!

260
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:24,262
That's enough, Roualt! You'll kill him!

261
00:34:24,297 --> 00:34:27,754
Let him die! Let go of me!

262
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:44,449
I told you he was weird! He acts
like nothing happened!

263
00:34:44,484 --> 00:34:45,715
He's sick.

264
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:49,220
I'd say he's probably in shock from
being taken away from his parents.

265
00:34:49,255 --> 00:34:52,021
Zakuro will make us some medicine.

266
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:55,514
Okay, but he's not joining the gang, all right?

267
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:13,867
A kooloop-tree puppet?!

268
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:26,488
I have to wear those gloves.

269
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:29,326
Sorry.

270
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:35,965
To Tamas, eh?

271
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,563
Many centuries have passed since the
people of Arcana went Below.

272
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:46,004
Who knows if you could even reach there?

273
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:51,781
But Zakuro, the townspeople say that sometimes

274
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:55,351
you can see people from Below
up here in Arcana.

275
00:35:56,687 --> 00:36:02,125
Maybe there's a way out that
we don't know about.

276
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,467
Speaking of kooloop trees...

277
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:15,773
They say there's an ancient
kooloop tree in Tamas

278
00:36:15,808 --> 00:36:19,539
that has miraculous powers.

279
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:27,049
Does that have anything to do with Palme?

280
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:32,852
I don't know. But he doesn't come
from any ordinary kooloop tree.

281
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:40,596
I know!

282
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:44,001
We'll ask Shatta, he'll know!
He came from Below!

283
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:46,970
I completely forgot about that. Right, Pu?

284
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:50,806
Pu? Huh?

285
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:03,499
His neck's full of wires!

286
00:37:03,534 --> 00:37:05,646
You can see inside his head!

287
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,159
No wonder his head's so hard.

288
00:37:08,194 --> 00:37:10,193
Cut it out, Roualt!

289
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,526
Pu! What did you tell them?!

290
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:14,530
Nothing!

291
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,966
Let's think about this, Mu.

292
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:19,802
We'll sell him for a good price to Gyariko.

293
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:22,838
He's eccentric. Once he sees the puppet,
he'll pay whatever we want.

294
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:24,508
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
He's eccentric. Once he sees the puppet,
he'll pay whatever we want.

295
00:37:24,543 --> 00:37:25,374
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

296
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:29,614
We could even trade him for a giant
kooloop tree that gushes oil!

297
00:37:29,649 --> 00:37:31,081
Whoa!

298
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:34,115
We're not finished talking just yet.

299
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:35,918
Pu...

300
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:39,445
"Ring-a-ling, ring-a-ling"...

301
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,958
What are you doing, Mu! That's kahla oil!

302
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:50,899
If you try to sell Palme, I'll set this on fire!

303
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:52,929
Careful, Mu!

304
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:55,839
Here, Shatta!

305
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:59,002
What's the matter, Mu? Calm down.

306
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:00,643
Shatta!

307
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:04,180
You'll be as bad as the grown-ups you hate!

308
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:08,953
Settle down, will you? It's just a
kooloop-wood puppet.

309
00:38:08,988 --> 00:38:11,046
But he's one of us!

310
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:16,292
Let's not fight. Even puppets don't
want to get torn apart.

311
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:22,333
We're going to pawn him off
on some rich sucker.

312
00:38:22,368 --> 00:38:23,800
There's nothing wrong with that!

313
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:27,235
Roualt! You...

314
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:29,931
What's with this dagger?!

315
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,377
Where did you get it?

316
00:38:33,412 --> 00:38:35,004
Uh, well...

317
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:37,441
Where?!

318
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:44,921
From him?

319
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:47,281
Don't move!

320
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:49,358
Hey! What happened?

321
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:49,960
What? What?
Hey! What happened?

322
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:50,660
What? What?

323
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:50,895
What? What?
Look! What's that light?!

324
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:52,988
Look! What's that light?!

325
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:08,644
Palme! Hurry!

326
00:39:10,214 --> 00:39:11,681
This way!

327
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:15,445
Wait! Let me talk to him!

328
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:36,763
Mu! Wait! Mu!

329
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,037
Mother...

330
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:33,025
From Gyariko? Give it here.

331
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:49,578
I'm sorry!

332
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:52,548
Don't touch my clothes!

333
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:07,223
Gyariko sent you that.

334
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:28,141
Sending presents to little girls who
haven't even grown breasts yet!

335
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:31,516
For Heaven's sake!

336
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:37,593
You're just like your father!

337
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:45,293
He never said a word. He always had that
stupid grin on his face...

338
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:50,404
He had no stomach for anything, your father.

339
00:41:51,575 --> 00:41:55,033
And now I'm stuck looking after
the child I had with him.

340
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:01,015
This is what my life's become?!

341
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:03,886
Say something!

342
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:11,860
We're going to Toroi.

343
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:47,522
What?! You're going Below with this... thing?!

344
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,728
We can't just leave him like this!

345
00:43:50,763 --> 00:43:53,596
So what'll happen to US?

346
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:56,327
We're the only family we've got!

347
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,800
What's wrong, Palme?

348
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:18,055
I go to the darkness of the white forest's spring

349
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:26,629
I go to rid myself of memories

350
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:27,396
Many bitter fruits of the silverberry

351
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:28,932
Xian!
Many bitter fruits of the silverberry

352
00:44:28,967 --> 00:44:34,338
Many bitter fruits of the silverberry

353
00:44:34,373 --> 00:44:34,703
And the sad fruit of the kusupia

354
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:37,408
Xian! Xian!
And the sad fruit of the kusupia

355
00:44:37,443 --> 00:44:42,580
And the sad fruit of the kusupia

356
00:44:42,615 --> 00:44:47,683
In the garden full of black flowers

357
00:44:47,718 --> 00:44:50,020
Xian, look! Lilias!
In the garden full of black flowers

358
00:44:50,055 --> 00:44:51,885
In the garden full of black flowers

359
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:54,690
As my tears flow

360
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:56,818
Xian! Hey, Xian!
As my tears flow

361
00:44:59,963 --> 00:45:00,864
Xian?
As my tears flow

362
00:45:00,899 --> 00:45:01,765
Xian?
It is these I must-

363
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:05,292
It is these I must-

364
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:17,079
Xian?

365
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:21,242
Xian!

366
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:27,223
Xian!

367
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:34,230
Palme!

368
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,759
I was calling you.

369
00:45:42,973 --> 00:45:45,874
Didn't you hear me?

370
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:50,847
What's wrong with him?

371
00:45:50,882 --> 00:45:53,183
That's right! The pendant!

372
00:45:53,218 --> 00:45:55,276
Popo! Your pendant!

373
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:03,717
So you had it, Xian...

374
00:46:05,195 --> 00:46:06,662
Palme?!

375
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:08,966
Thank goodness!

376
00:46:09,001 --> 00:46:10,194
No!

377
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:14,728
Sing. Please? Sing for me.

378
00:46:16,073 --> 00:46:18,633
Xian! Sing for me!

379
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:20,576
No!

380
00:46:32,756 --> 00:46:37,386
I love it when you sing, Xian.

381
00:46:54,444 --> 00:46:55,911
Xian!

382
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:09,026
Shatta, you saw that blue light that
came from his neck, right?

383
00:47:09,061 --> 00:47:11,256
That's some incredible oil!

384
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:15,631
Shatta?

385
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:18,260
Roualt, I'm taking this dagger.

386
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:26,742
Palme!

387
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:30,380
Xian! Xian! Xian!!

388
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:34,483
Ma'am!

389
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:34,718
Xian!
Ma'am!

390
00:47:34,753 --> 00:47:35,617
Xian!

391
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:36,019
Xian!
Let him out!

392
00:47:36,054 --> 00:47:37,671
Let him out!

393
00:47:37,706 --> 00:47:39,254
Xian! Xian!

394
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:43,023
Please! He just mistook her for someone else!

395
00:47:43,058 --> 00:47:46,757
You pests! Crickle! Get these runts off the ship!

396
00:47:48,098 --> 00:47:49,963
You want to sell him!

397
00:47:50,667 --> 00:47:53,534
The scholars of Toroi will go gaga for him.

398
00:47:58,108 --> 00:47:59,575
There they are!

399
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:12,855
What the hell..?!

400
00:48:27,137 --> 00:48:28,070
We're going to crash!

401
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:28,639
Pu!
We're going to crash!

402
00:48:28,674 --> 00:48:29,571
Pu!

403
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:56,465
Who are you?!

404
00:49:00,537 --> 00:49:03,438
Xian! Xian! Xian!

405
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:07,709
Shatta!

406
00:49:07,744 --> 00:49:08,145
They took Palme!
Shatta!

407
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:08,977
They took Palme!

408
00:49:09,012 --> 00:49:09,246
They took Palme!
Xian!

409
00:49:09,281 --> 00:49:10,679
Xian!

410
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:14,381
Forget about that puppet!

411
00:49:14,416 --> 00:49:16,313
You dummy! He means money!

412
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:25,295
Xian!!

413
00:49:30,334 --> 00:49:31,800
What a day!

414
00:49:31,835 --> 00:49:34,395
Crickle! Don't just stand there,
get this boat moving!

415
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:38,974
Settle down!

416
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:44,640
Don't stop! Shake them off!

417
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,617
Damn it!

418
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:51,487
Xian!

419
00:49:56,026 --> 00:49:57,493
The crest of Soma!

420
00:49:58,562 --> 00:50:00,029
Damn!

421
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,465
He's caught!

422
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,312
Xian...

423
00:50:19,616 --> 00:50:21,083
Where are you, Xian?

424
00:50:25,255 --> 00:50:27,120
I'm coming to you!

425
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:29,183
It's inside him?!

426
00:50:34,664 --> 00:50:36,655
I'm coming to you!

427
00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:41,730
No... no... I'm not Xian.

428
00:50:41,938 --> 00:50:44,429
I'm... I'm...

429
00:50:50,647 --> 00:50:54,484
There's no mistaking it. That's the
capsule Soma gave to the Sol Tribe!

430
00:50:54,519 --> 00:50:56,543
So this is where she hid it!

431
00:50:57,287 --> 00:50:59,523
The Egg of Touto's inside here!

432
00:50:59,558 --> 00:51:00,990
I'll cut it out of him!

433
00:51:03,994 --> 00:51:07,662
Damn it! The crosskahla's seeped into his body!

434
00:51:07,697 --> 00:51:11,155
The oil preserving the egg will leak
out if not removed carefully.

435
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:17,420
Let go of him!

436
00:51:17,455 --> 00:51:19,369
A kid from Below?!

437
00:51:20,877 --> 00:51:24,313
Tell me! Who gave you that dagger?!

438
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:29,885
Maggot!

439
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,946
Stop! Guns don't work on them! Hota!
What are you doing?!

440
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:36,619
Damn you!

441
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:14,060
Xian's dead, Palme.

442
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:21,426
You don't have to bring her flowers...

443
00:52:22,105 --> 00:52:24,903
or make her meals any more.

444
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:31,545
She doesn't need them.

445
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:40,312
Xian... is dead.

446
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:52,665
Baku! They're gathering around
the bola! Stab it to death!

447
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:02,110
Your job's done. Go join your friends!

448
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:39,514
Hey! Hey!

449
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:39,716
Palme!
Hey! Hey!

450
00:53:39,751 --> 00:53:41,013
Palme!

451
00:53:42,085 --> 00:53:43,552
He's wrecked!

452
00:53:43,587 --> 00:53:44,753
Take him to the ship!

453
00:53:44,788 --> 00:53:45,088
Shatta!
Take him to the ship!

454
00:53:45,123 --> 00:53:46,214
Shatta!

455
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:50,859
Is anyone here?!

456
00:53:51,861 --> 00:53:53,328
Hey!

457
00:54:22,892 --> 00:54:24,926
Roualt!

458
00:54:24,961 --> 00:54:29,625
Pu! You double-crosser! I'll remember this!

459
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:35,971
The transformer's busted.

460
00:54:36,006 --> 00:54:40,310
Damn! If that puppet falls into the
hands of the scholars of Toroi,

461
00:54:40,345 --> 00:54:41,945
they'll take the capsule apart!

462
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:44,398
Quick! I can't breathe!

463
00:54:44,433 --> 00:54:46,781
This is the last filter.

464
00:54:46,816 --> 00:54:50,654
And if that happens, not only will our
tribe remain banished...

465
00:54:50,689 --> 00:54:52,645
Soma will destroy our villages!

466
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:54,389
I know.

467
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:57,726
You know, Gus...

468
00:55:01,364 --> 00:55:03,059
It's strange.

469
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:08,665
The Egg of Touto is what the Sol Tribe
were so desperate to reclaim.

470
00:55:08,905 --> 00:55:13,535
So why did she hide it in that puppet?
There's not even a trace of her.

471
00:55:13,843 --> 00:55:15,777
Who cares?

472
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:18,948
If the capsule is for real, that's all that matters.

473
00:55:18,983 --> 00:55:20,848
All we have to do is work out a deal with Soma.

474
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:43,805
He's not moving at all.

475
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,910
We'll get the scholars of Toroi to fix him.

476
00:55:46,945 --> 00:55:49,606
You believe Darumaya?

477
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,013
When we reach the valley of Toroi,

478
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:53,915
we'll look for a chance to get him out of here.

479
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:58,284
C'mon! Let's just forget about it
and leave that pile of junk!

480
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:02,457
Sheesh!

481
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:21,310
Uncle...

482
00:56:24,114 --> 00:56:30,053
Xian!

483
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:06,882
Palme!

484
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:10,893
It's Palme! He...

485
00:57:21,971 --> 00:57:25,338
That thing's going to make us a fortune!

486
00:57:29,012 --> 00:57:30,774
We risked our lives to bring it here.

487
00:57:30,809 --> 00:57:32,537
I expect you to give me a good price.

488
00:57:45,361 --> 00:57:48,530
What?! Not even a can of oil?!

489
00:57:48,565 --> 00:57:52,729
Look at it, Doctor! This is no
ordinary kooloop tree!

490
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:08,075
Palme!

491
00:58:28,204 --> 00:58:31,139
Been shopping, eh? Sawadust of the Sol!

492
00:58:31,908 --> 00:58:33,341
Who are you?!

493
00:58:33,376 --> 00:58:36,743
You're growing a lot of kooloop trees.

494
00:58:37,046 --> 00:58:41,216
The Mohi Tribe?! You've been
banished! Why are you here?

495
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:45,984
Why, you! No one who abandoned his
comrades talks to me like that!

496
00:58:46,322 --> 00:58:49,157
Soma would kill you for desertion!

497
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:52,962
Were you sent from Tamas to bring me in?!

498
00:58:52,997 --> 00:58:54,429
Relax.

499
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:57,332
Was a woman from your tribe here?

500
00:58:57,367 --> 00:59:01,326
I don't know. I'm not a man
of the Sol Tribe anymore.

501
00:59:01,671 --> 00:59:03,304
And I don't intend to ever go back.

502
00:59:03,339 --> 00:59:07,105
I suppose that doesn't matter. We need
your help. You're coming with us.

503
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:09,972
I want nothing to do with you! Now get out!

504
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:15,240
If Sol blood flows within you, surely
you'll want to hear us out.

505
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:17,138
No, Palme.

506
01:00:17,647 --> 01:00:20,115
Do you intend to turn into a
tree in a place like this?

507
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:22,811
Remember, Palme.

508
01:00:23,353 --> 01:00:27,289
Xian's alive. Don't fall asleep!

509
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:29,424
No.

510
01:00:30,526 --> 01:00:34,394
Xian's... dead.

511
01:00:35,865 --> 01:00:38,993
She doesn't need me.

512
01:00:39,669 --> 01:00:41,136
No.

513
01:00:41,938 --> 01:00:46,432
If that were true, why did that girl's
music remind you of Xian?

514
01:00:47,076 --> 01:00:50,204
Why did you rest your head in her lap?

515
01:00:51,347 --> 01:00:53,372
Think, Palme.

516
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:59,152
Xian is alive even now, within you.

517
01:01:02,892 --> 01:01:04,359
I don't believe it!

518
01:01:04,594 --> 01:01:07,296
They took the Egg of Touto?!

519
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:08,923
You'll see.

520
01:01:10,133 --> 01:01:12,693
It's them again! They're still alive!

521
01:01:13,636 --> 01:01:15,103
Shatta!

522
01:01:23,546 --> 01:01:29,451
Crosskahla flows in you, Palme.

523
01:01:30,453 --> 01:01:32,444
Crosskahla?

524
01:01:34,924 --> 01:01:38,087
The oil Xian spent her life looking for!

525
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:55,877
Xian?

526
01:01:59,348 --> 01:02:00,747
It's true!

527
01:02:03,086 --> 01:02:05,850
Xian's alive inside me!

528
01:02:06,155 --> 01:02:11,058
She's got lilias in her hand. She's smiling at me!

529
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:13,862
Yes.

530
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:17,228
You have inside you the memory of being loved.

531
01:02:19,102 --> 01:02:20,569
It's inside you.

532
01:02:21,537 --> 01:02:24,301
Koram? Is that you?

533
01:02:33,716 --> 01:02:35,183
It's Koram!

534
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:38,987
Sawadust!

535
01:02:40,223 --> 01:02:41,656
No, Baku!

536
01:02:42,792 --> 01:02:45,590
K-Koram's here!

537
01:02:45,625 --> 01:02:48,389
Mother? Mother!

538
01:02:48,698 --> 01:02:50,165
Mother?!

539
01:03:16,692 --> 01:03:18,557
Baku! Hey, Baku!

540
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,187
This is terrible...

541
01:03:26,736 --> 01:03:28,203
Move!

542
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:33,775
You again?!

543
01:03:35,945 --> 01:03:38,470
What are you doing?! Get out of here!

544
01:03:47,089 --> 01:03:48,556
Palme!

545
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:51,422
You're better!

546
01:03:55,064 --> 01:03:56,531
Hi, Baron.

547
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:04,005
Is that all?

548
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:04,507
Your mother vanished?!
Is that all?

549
01:04:04,542 --> 01:04:06,109
Your mother vanished?!

550
01:04:06,144 --> 01:04:07,676
Just forget about it.

551
01:04:07,877 --> 01:04:11,506
She gave you this. So hold on to it!

552
01:04:13,316 --> 01:04:16,519
She really said "the Egg of Touto?"

553
01:04:16,554 --> 01:04:17,213
Yes.

554
01:04:17,587 --> 01:04:18,020
Touto is far above the rock roof
Yes.

555
01:04:18,055 --> 01:04:21,274
Touto is far above the rock roof

556
01:04:21,309 --> 01:04:24,458
that covers the sky way up there.

557
01:04:24,493 --> 01:04:27,829
The only things that live there are giant heads!

558
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:31,500
Which is why it's not a place
that people can go to!

559
01:04:31,535 --> 01:04:33,764
That's what Koram said.

560
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:40,543
Alright. I'll come along.

561
01:04:40,578 --> 01:04:41,642
What?!

562
01:04:41,677 --> 01:04:42,044
Really?!
What?!

563
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:42,677
Really?!

564
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:43,179
Really?!
The people Below abandoned me,
and they're planning something.

565
01:04:43,214 --> 01:04:46,382
The people Below abandoned me,
and they're planning something.

566
01:04:46,417 --> 01:04:47,481
I want to see with my own eyes what that is.

567
01:04:47,516 --> 01:04:47,884
What about our plan to take over Flamingo?
I want to see with my own eyes what that is.

568
01:04:47,919 --> 01:04:51,921
What about our plan to take over Flamingo?

569
01:04:51,956 --> 01:04:54,822
Are you going to abandon us, Shatta?

570
01:04:54,857 --> 01:04:58,725
Besides, how will you find a hole
that leads down Below?

571
01:05:01,464 --> 01:05:02,931
He'll find it.

572
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:09,204
You're Popo, right?

573
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:15,978
Don't be afraid. I was made to help
Xian after she got sick.

574
01:05:16,013 --> 01:05:18,412
But she died.

575
01:05:20,049 --> 01:05:21,710
I'm sorry I thought you were her.

576
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:29,724
Popo...

577
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:32,322
I want to hear it.

578
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:35,526
The song that Xian always sang.

579
01:05:36,565 --> 01:05:39,295
Don't worry. I won't make
the same mistake again.

580
01:05:53,082 --> 01:05:57,951
Once I deliver the Egg, I'm going
to Xian's hometown.

581
01:05:58,321 --> 01:06:00,482
It's called Cote Ploire.

582
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:05,727
Look, Popo!

583
01:06:09,365 --> 01:06:12,095
Stone light is falling from the Roof!

584
01:06:13,035 --> 01:06:14,866
Aren't they beautiful?

585
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:36,455
Come here.

586
01:06:48,804 --> 01:06:50,271
What?

587
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:02,517
Palme...

588
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,421
Wow!

589
01:07:20,903 --> 01:07:22,405
Selene flowers.

590
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:23,872
Flowers?!

591
01:07:26,242 --> 01:07:28,403
Look, Palme!

592
01:08:09,652 --> 01:08:12,212
What's that, Popo?

593
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:17,288
Crystallized honey the insects collected.

594
01:08:17,827 --> 01:08:20,352
It's beautiful!

595
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:22,330
It smells nice.

596
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:24,232
Here.

597
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:31,072
Don't you think?

598
01:08:45,921 --> 01:08:47,548
I don't know.

599
01:08:54,063 --> 01:08:55,758
Because I'm just a puppet.

600
01:08:59,535 --> 01:09:01,435
That doesn't matter.

601
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:05,164
You're the only one I've told about this place.

602
01:09:23,959 --> 01:09:26,427
Popo, your face is all white.

603
01:09:34,737 --> 01:09:36,204
Popo...

604
01:09:36,305 --> 01:09:37,772
Yes?

605
01:09:38,307 --> 01:09:41,538
I want you to come with me to Xian's hometown.

606
01:09:45,214 --> 01:09:46,681
You want me...

607
01:09:47,283 --> 01:09:50,081
You want me to go with you?

608
01:10:07,136 --> 01:10:10,304
Mother! I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

609
01:10:10,339 --> 01:10:14,002
But Palme wants me to go
with him! He wants ME!

610
01:10:16,645 --> 01:10:18,112
Popo!

611
01:10:18,247 --> 01:10:22,308
You've got the wrong idea, you pile of junk!

612
01:10:22,818 --> 01:10:27,016
You're a puppet! You shouldn't go
around messing with people!

613
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:29,990
You can't hide that.

614
01:10:30,025 --> 01:10:31,859
Mother, please! Let me go with him!

615
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:32,294
Let go!
Mother, please! Let me go with him!

616
01:10:32,329 --> 01:10:32,626
Let go!

617
01:10:32,661 --> 01:10:33,395
Let go!
But I've never... I've never...

618
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:36,365
But I've never... I've never...

619
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:37,855
Take your hands off me!

620
01:10:38,133 --> 01:10:41,569
The best thing for you to do is listen to me!

621
01:10:43,606 --> 01:10:46,740
I'm just... I'm just...

622
01:10:46,775 --> 01:10:48,743
I'm just your puppet in the end!

623
01:10:49,812 --> 01:10:55,217
How... how dare you speak to me that way!

624
01:10:55,252 --> 01:10:57,742
Mother? Mother!

625
01:11:09,331 --> 01:11:10,798
Palme!

626
01:11:11,133 --> 01:11:14,193
That old lady will never let her go.

627
01:11:14,403 --> 01:11:15,870
C'mon, let's go.

628
01:11:17,406 --> 01:11:21,377
Are you OK? We're going Below, you know.

629
01:11:21,412 --> 01:11:22,576
You shut up.

630
01:11:22,611 --> 01:11:22,845
Shatta!
You shut up.

631
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:24,073
Shatta!

632
01:11:27,449 --> 01:11:28,767
Roualt!

633
01:11:28,802 --> 01:11:30,050
Popo!

634
01:11:30,085 --> 01:11:30,519
Keep back!
Popo!

635
01:11:30,554 --> 01:11:31,508
Keep back!

636
01:11:34,256 --> 01:11:37,091
Stay there, you old cow!

637
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:41,163
Shatta, I'll trade you the girl
for the oil in the puppet!

638
01:11:41,198 --> 01:11:43,222
Don't be stupid, Roualt.

639
01:11:44,566 --> 01:11:46,600
That oil is Palme's blood.

640
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:50,738
Have you gone nuts?!
That oil means real money!

641
01:11:50,773 --> 01:11:53,776
If you aren't going to, then
I'll take over Flamingo!

642
01:11:53,811 --> 01:11:55,243
Come here, Palme!

643
01:11:56,011 --> 01:11:59,811
Hurry up! Don't you care what happens to her?

644
01:12:05,187 --> 01:12:06,654
Palme!

645
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:10,216
You can have my oil.

646
01:12:14,963 --> 01:12:17,989
No! Stop it!

647
01:12:19,902 --> 01:12:21,733
Palme!

648
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:27,208
Stop, Palme!

649
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:29,007
Popo!

650
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:35,550
Popo!

651
01:12:55,938 --> 01:12:57,405
Uncle...

652
01:12:57,906 --> 01:13:01,342
I'll be back, Roualt.

653
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:03,277
Shatta!

654
01:13:07,883 --> 01:13:12,320
Crickle! Quit your lollygagging! I'm setting sail!

655
01:13:14,289 --> 01:13:18,521
From Mother?

656
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:23,030
Father!

657
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:31,301
Mother... I'm sorry!

658
01:13:31,807 --> 01:13:33,274
Popo...

659
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:45,110
Let's go.

660
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:46,687
Okay.

661
01:13:56,031 --> 01:13:58,867
Stay away from me! Get out of here!

662
01:13:58,902 --> 01:14:01,668
Th-that thing is possessed by Koram!

663
01:14:01,703 --> 01:14:05,434
My mother's dead. What can a dead woman do?

664
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:11,178
Are you Shatta? You're alive?!

665
01:14:11,213 --> 01:14:15,317
Then you're Koram's son. What did she say?

666
01:14:15,352 --> 01:14:17,853
Did she really go to Touto?

667
01:14:17,888 --> 01:14:19,320
I don't know.

668
01:14:20,823 --> 01:14:22,586
Look at this.

669
01:14:28,163 --> 01:14:29,630
Sawadust!

670
01:14:33,335 --> 01:14:36,463
You'll never get oil raising plants like these...

671
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:40,309
...oil raising plants like these...

672
01:14:40,344 --> 01:14:41,675
Crap!

673
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:43,177
Come here!

674
01:14:44,546 --> 01:14:47,483
It's faint, but it smells like down Below.

675
01:14:47,518 --> 01:14:49,683
What?! A way in?

676
01:14:49,718 --> 01:14:52,482
Sawadust found the old entrance.

677
01:14:59,294 --> 01:15:00,861
A smell?

678
01:15:00,896 --> 01:15:05,934
Koram and I were still infants
when we came up here,

679
01:15:05,969 --> 01:15:07,799
but I remember the smell.

680
01:15:09,137 --> 01:15:13,022
Ever since I can remember, we
were scouring the earth

681
01:15:13,057 --> 01:15:16,907
looking for the stone pillar that
leads up to Touto.

682
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:21,214
The brave Sol Tribe were the chosen warriors.

683
01:15:21,783 --> 01:15:24,343
Our parents were willing to risk their lives.

684
01:15:25,954 --> 01:15:31,221
The people of Tamas placed their
hope in a new lifeform...

685
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:36,654
The human Soma made... Laala.

686
01:15:37,499 --> 01:15:38,966
"Human?"

687
01:15:39,801 --> 01:15:42,964
In Tamas there's a giant kooloop tree.

688
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:47,031
Zakuro said it had miraculous powers.

689
01:15:48,243 --> 01:15:50,811
Try to find that kooloop.

690
01:15:50,846 --> 01:15:54,648
You know, you'll never get oil
raising plants like these.

691
01:15:54,683 --> 01:15:55,684
You'll never get oil raising plants like these.
You know, you'll never get oil
raising plants like these.

692
01:15:55,719 --> 01:15:57,948
You'll never get oil raising plants like these.

693
01:15:58,654 --> 01:16:00,821
You'll never get oil raising plants like these.

694
01:16:00,856 --> 01:16:01,957
Th-the kooloop's talking!
You'll never get oil raising plants like these.

695
01:16:01,992 --> 01:16:02,890
Th-the kooloop's talking!

696
01:16:02,925 --> 01:16:03,492
Th-the kooloop's talking!
You'll never get oil raising plants like these.

697
01:16:03,527 --> 01:16:04,024
You'll never get oil raising plants like these.

698
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:06,028
The kooloop tree feeds on
the memory of civilization
You'll never get oil raising plants like these.

699
01:16:06,063 --> 01:16:09,598
The kooloop tree feeds on
the memory of civilization

700
01:16:09,633 --> 01:16:11,566
that is dissolved in the soil and reacts to it.

701
01:16:12,367 --> 01:16:14,392
It's a mutation.

702
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:18,672
Soma is a kooloop tree that evolved

703
01:16:18,707 --> 01:16:22,374
over centuries of those mutations.

704
01:16:23,245 --> 01:16:27,045
But Soma grew old just like any other kooloop.

705
01:16:27,649 --> 01:16:30,447
The tree began to wither.

706
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:36,480
And that monster tree bore fruit...

707
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:44,297
For long ages Soma acted as a god.

708
01:16:46,268 --> 01:16:52,138
But there was one essential thing he
couldn't put into Laala.

709
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:55,673
A soul.

710
01:16:56,845 --> 01:17:01,049
The energy that is the source of all
things exists in Touto.

711
01:17:01,084 --> 01:17:03,244
That's why we headed to the Roof!

712
01:17:04,119 --> 01:17:09,819
In order to find the Egg, we journeyed
into unexplored regions.

713
01:17:10,659 --> 01:17:14,356
The expectations placed upon
us kids was overwhelming.

714
01:17:17,265 --> 01:17:21,103
So it really is true that a person was
made from a kooloop tree?

715
01:17:21,138 --> 01:17:22,469
Yes...

716
01:17:22,504 --> 01:17:26,608
If that's the case, then I absolutely
must go see Soma!

717
01:17:26,643 --> 01:17:29,873
Popo! Maybe I can become a human too!

718
01:17:30,245 --> 01:17:34,082
If I bring him this, I'll bet he'll make me human!

719
01:17:34,117 --> 01:17:36,917
Make you human?

720
01:17:36,952 --> 01:17:39,716
It's no good being a puppet.

721
01:17:42,924 --> 01:17:46,951
If I were human, your mother
wouldn't talk to me like that.

722
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:54,636
You want that?

723
01:17:54,671 --> 01:17:56,103
Yes.

724
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:16,088
What are you doing, silly?! It's only this deep!

725
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:19,326
What's so funny?

726
01:18:21,396 --> 01:18:23,196
What an old dock!

727
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:25,098
It's falling to pieces!

728
01:18:25,133 --> 01:18:28,534
The pit leading Below is just up ahead.

729
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:34,274
You know, I don't think this is a very good idea.

730
01:18:34,943 --> 01:18:37,212
If this doesn't work, the only other way

731
01:18:37,247 --> 01:18:39,481
is the Stone Pillar of Toto we climbed

732
01:18:39,516 --> 01:18:41,784
when I was still a child.

733
01:18:41,819 --> 01:18:44,052
The Stone Pillar of Toto?

734
01:18:49,658 --> 01:18:50,390
Palme!

735
01:18:50,425 --> 01:18:51,176
Huh?
Palme!

736
01:18:51,211 --> 01:18:51,927
Huh?
Run!

737
01:18:51,962 --> 01:18:52,552
Run!

738
01:18:52,994 --> 01:18:54,461
Shatta!

739
01:18:56,264 --> 01:18:58,265
Let him go!

740
01:18:58,300 --> 01:18:58,867
Back off!
Let him go!

741
01:18:58,902 --> 01:18:59,765
Back off!

742
01:19:00,035 --> 01:19:01,552
Popo!

743
01:19:01,587 --> 01:19:03,070
Palme!

744
01:19:08,243 --> 01:19:09,710
Get off!

745
01:19:10,178 --> 01:19:13,238
Please! Take me! I want to see Laala!

746
01:19:19,988 --> 01:19:23,253
You have a warrior's blood. That woman,
she's your mother, right?

747
01:19:28,497 --> 01:19:31,022
Wait! Wait for me!

748
01:19:31,199 --> 01:19:32,962
Wait!

749
01:19:33,135 --> 01:19:34,602
Fool!

750
01:19:42,711 --> 01:19:44,178
Damn!

751
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:51,085
Palme!

752
01:20:05,901 --> 01:20:07,198
Palme!

753
01:20:11,173 --> 01:20:12,841
Are you OK, Palme?

754
01:20:12,876 --> 01:20:13,840
Yes.

755
01:20:13,875 --> 01:20:14,342
I'll pull you up. Hang on tight.
Yes.

756
01:20:14,377 --> 01:20:16,867
I'll pull you up. Hang on tight.

757
01:20:24,619 --> 01:20:26,086
Shatta...

758
01:20:29,758 --> 01:20:31,225
I'm glad he's alright...

759
01:20:52,914 --> 01:20:56,484
Hey Shatta! Is it far to the Stone Pillar of Toto?

760
01:20:56,519 --> 01:20:57,951
I don't know.

761
01:20:57,986 --> 01:21:01,890
It's pretty big, so we should be able to
see it if we head due west.

762
01:21:01,925 --> 01:21:03,983
What's that darn Popo doing now?

763
01:21:06,428 --> 01:21:07,895
C'mere, c'mere!

764
01:21:10,932 --> 01:21:13,162
C'mon! This way!

765
01:21:13,935 --> 01:21:17,393
Look, Palme. The floating grass follows you!

766
01:21:17,739 --> 01:21:19,206
Hey, Palme!

767
01:21:19,941 --> 01:21:22,611
Man, they're slow. Wasting time...

768
01:21:22,646 --> 01:21:24,078
Mu, come with me!

769
01:21:25,647 --> 01:21:27,114
Watch this, Palme!

770
01:21:40,695 --> 01:21:42,162
Here goes!

771
01:21:42,831 --> 01:21:44,298
Yahoo!

772
01:21:58,613 --> 01:22:01,912
Look, Popo! It's like a balloon!

773
01:22:03,518 --> 01:22:04,917
What's the matter, Popo?

774
01:22:08,490 --> 01:22:11,118
It's just a piece of dead grass! Come on.

775
01:22:12,994 --> 01:22:16,122
Yeah! It's just a piece of dead grass!

776
01:22:17,866 --> 01:22:19,128
Palme!

777
01:22:29,511 --> 01:22:31,138
Hota, are you OK?

778
01:22:32,714 --> 01:22:36,115
I think we've ended up near the Tamas border.

779
01:22:46,428 --> 01:22:48,157
The village is in ruins!

780
01:23:03,945 --> 01:23:06,778
The Mohi Tribe's been wiped out?

781
01:23:09,117 --> 01:23:13,281
There's no sign of most of the border
tribes. They've all been slaughtered.

782
01:23:14,122 --> 01:23:18,360
Help us. If that capsule is the real thing...

783
01:23:18,395 --> 01:23:21,496
it must be destroyed right away.

784
01:23:21,531 --> 01:23:23,396
A revolt against Soma?

785
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:29,667
Soma's rapid aging has left us like this.

786
01:23:31,873 --> 01:23:36,537
The life force is disappearing from
everything here Below.

787
01:23:37,078 --> 01:23:39,314
Isn't that why Laala was to be born?

788
01:23:39,349 --> 01:23:41,179
That's what we thought.

789
01:23:44,652 --> 01:23:48,816
But Soma's killed more than half
the people of Tamas...

790
01:23:49,157 --> 01:23:51,059
and the rest are dying.

791
01:23:51,094 --> 01:23:52,856
Why?

792
01:23:53,762 --> 01:23:55,395
Is this Soma's will?

793
01:23:55,430 --> 01:23:59,729
Soma's intelligence comes from the
memory of ancient civilizations.

794
01:23:59,764 --> 01:24:04,028
They say they flourished, then fell to
slaughter and destruction.

795
01:24:04,406 --> 01:24:09,469
It's only a guess, but perhaps the
memory is repeating itself.

796
01:24:10,345 --> 01:24:17,152
Or perhaps Soma intends to negate the
world he created, including us...

797
01:24:17,187 --> 01:24:20,088
and give it to Laala.

798
01:24:20,123 --> 01:24:21,555
"Negate?!"

799
01:24:25,026 --> 01:24:30,293
We shall prevent the birth of Laala and
break away from Soma!

800
01:24:31,032 --> 01:24:34,399
We of Tamas shall take control of our destiny!

801
01:25:20,081 --> 01:25:21,548
Father...

802
01:25:49,043 --> 01:25:50,840
Popo!

803
01:25:51,179 --> 01:25:53,647
Where are you?

804
01:26:01,956 --> 01:26:03,184
A bola...

805
01:26:06,227 --> 01:26:09,685
Did you show me a dream of my father?

806
01:26:17,005 --> 01:26:17,670
Come here...

807
01:26:17,705 --> 01:26:18,506
Here she is!
Come here...

808
01:26:18,541 --> 01:26:19,139
Here she is!

809
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:21,904
Palme! I found Popo! Palme!

810
01:26:22,310 --> 01:26:24,612
We've been looking all over for you!

811
01:26:24,647 --> 01:26:26,047
What were you doing?!

812
01:26:26,082 --> 01:26:26,103
Popo!

813
01:26:37,692 --> 01:26:40,286
You shouldn't be wandering around like that!

814
01:26:45,066 --> 01:26:47,694
Palme?

815
01:26:47,936 --> 01:26:49,665
A bola!

816
01:26:51,873 --> 01:26:52,705
I'll get rid of it!

817
01:26:52,740 --> 01:26:53,374
No!
I'll get rid of it!

818
01:26:53,409 --> 01:26:54,207
No!

819
01:26:54,242 --> 01:26:56,369
This one's gentle...

820
01:26:57,145 --> 01:26:58,612
Popo!

821
01:27:00,415 --> 01:27:03,213
You! Get out of here!

822
01:27:03,551 --> 01:27:05,118
Stay away from her!

823
01:27:05,153 --> 01:27:07,280
No, Palme! The poor thing!

824
01:27:15,430 --> 01:27:18,365
I was worried about you!

825
01:27:20,835 --> 01:27:22,427
Popo, you're acting strange!

826
01:27:24,205 --> 01:27:26,736
Things like this start hanging around

827
01:27:26,771 --> 01:27:29,268
because you never cheer up and act human.

828
01:27:29,811 --> 01:27:32,871
At this rate I'll never become human!

829
01:27:33,381 --> 01:27:35,212
I... I...

830
01:27:41,856 --> 01:27:43,084
Shatta...

831
01:27:44,659 --> 01:27:46,991
Palme... that's enough.

832
01:27:50,298 --> 01:27:51,765
Come on, Palme.

833
01:28:05,747 --> 01:28:07,214
Popo...

834
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:08,443
Look! That's the Stone Pillar of Toto, right?

835
01:29:08,478 --> 01:29:11,139
Yep. We're almost there.

836
01:29:16,417 --> 01:29:17,216
An aguri!

837
01:29:17,251 --> 01:29:17,919
It's just a baby! What's wrong?
An aguri!

838
01:29:17,954 --> 01:29:19,654
It's just a baby! What's wrong?

839
01:29:19,689 --> 01:29:21,144
It's shaking!

840
01:29:28,863 --> 01:29:30,091
Take cover!

841
01:29:41,109 --> 01:29:42,576
Shatta!

842
01:30:59,086 --> 01:31:00,644
Wow!

843
01:31:04,992 --> 01:31:06,653
You're the aguri from earlier today!

844
01:31:10,364 --> 01:31:11,956
Come here...

845
01:31:14,869 --> 01:31:17,235
Come on! That's it.

846
01:31:19,907 --> 01:31:21,738
Nice aguri...

847
01:31:56,811 --> 01:31:58,511
That's awful!

848
01:31:58,546 --> 01:32:00,681
And after we went to the trouble of saving it!

849
01:32:00,716 --> 01:32:02,911
Palme, did you do this?

850
01:32:03,918 --> 01:32:04,617
No!

851
01:32:04,652 --> 01:32:05,386
Then who did?
No!

852
01:32:05,421 --> 01:32:06,252
Then who did?

853
01:32:06,287 --> 01:32:07,854
Who else could have?

854
01:32:07,889 --> 01:32:12,588
I... I don't know anything about it! I don't! I don't!

855
01:32:30,645 --> 01:32:33,478
How long are you going to stay
like that? Enough already!

856
01:32:34,482 --> 01:32:39,078
Do something, Palme! She's
been like this all day!

857
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:47,960
It's time to go.

858
01:32:54,101 --> 01:32:56,501
Do you want to turn to stone?

859
01:32:57,572 --> 01:32:59,563
I want to become human.

860
01:33:01,175 --> 01:33:03,166
Aren't you sad?

861
01:33:04,245 --> 01:33:05,735
I'm a puppet.

862
01:33:06,380 --> 01:33:10,516
You didn't used to be like that!
You're strange now!

863
01:33:10,551 --> 01:33:13,281
I know I'm strange! That's why I'm
trying to become human.

864
01:33:15,089 --> 01:33:16,556
Palme...

865
01:33:26,734 --> 01:33:28,201
What's this?!

866
01:33:44,051 --> 01:33:45,518
Hurry.

867
01:33:46,921 --> 01:33:48,388
Hurry.

868
01:33:50,391 --> 01:33:52,222
Soma awaits.

869
01:33:53,561 --> 01:33:55,028
Hurry.

870
01:33:56,063 --> 01:33:57,963
Soma is waiting for you.

871
01:34:03,004 --> 01:34:04,883
For... for me?

872
01:34:04,918 --> 01:34:06,762
Soma is waiting.

873
01:34:07,975 --> 01:34:10,042
Soma's waiting for me?

874
01:34:10,077 --> 01:34:12,238
Soma is waiting for you to come.

875
01:34:14,315 --> 01:34:15,782
Hurry.

876
01:34:18,085 --> 01:34:19,151
It's gone!

877
01:34:19,186 --> 01:34:19,587
What was that? A ghost?
It's gone!

878
01:34:19,622 --> 01:34:21,851
What was that? A ghost?

879
01:34:25,292 --> 01:34:27,760
Soma's waiting for me!

880
01:34:34,769 --> 01:34:37,897
Hurry, Popo! Quick!

881
01:34:40,274 --> 01:34:43,266
Palme! Take it easy!

882
01:34:46,447 --> 01:34:47,914
Palme...

883
01:34:49,083 --> 01:34:50,778
What, Shatta?

884
01:34:51,352 --> 01:34:53,183
Are you OK, Popo?

885
01:34:55,756 --> 01:34:57,951
Show me that capsule.

886
01:34:59,994 --> 01:35:02,588
Something about it bothers me.

887
01:35:09,603 --> 01:35:11,539
You want to steal it!

888
01:35:11,574 --> 01:35:13,105
Huh? Palme...

889
01:35:13,140 --> 01:35:17,489
I knew it! You're from Below, just like those men!

890
01:35:17,524 --> 01:35:21,839
What are you talking about?
Shatta wouldn't do that!

891
01:35:22,249 --> 01:35:24,817
This is the most important thing I have!

892
01:35:24,852 --> 01:35:28,219
I won't let anyone touch it! Not even Shatta!

893
01:35:29,857 --> 01:35:31,324
Suit yourself.

894
01:35:34,295 --> 01:35:36,763
I don't need this thing from Below.

895
01:35:38,499 --> 01:35:43,003
I'll... I'll be fine without you, Shatta!

896
01:35:43,038 --> 01:35:45,372
Soma will protect me!

897
01:35:45,407 --> 01:35:46,941
Come on, Popo!

898
01:35:46,976 --> 01:35:48,408
Palme!

899
01:35:48,709 --> 01:35:53,408
You talk big for a puppet! There's no
way you'll ever become human!

900
01:35:54,648 --> 01:35:56,115
Shatta!

901
01:36:24,845 --> 01:36:26,642
Popo! We're almost there!

902
01:36:29,517 --> 01:36:32,509
I'll become a human! A human!

903
01:36:33,220 --> 01:36:34,789
It won't be long now!

904
01:36:34,824 --> 01:36:37,223
Soon! Soon!

905
01:36:39,293 --> 01:36:43,093
Soon... Soon I'll be with my father...

906
01:36:57,444 --> 01:36:59,810
We leave tomorrow, without the girl.

907
01:37:00,247 --> 01:37:02,448
Gandel, what are you saying?

908
01:37:02,483 --> 01:37:04,576
Do you intend to leave Koram to die?

909
01:37:05,019 --> 01:37:07,852
The future of Tamas is in our hands.

910
01:37:08,189 --> 01:37:11,125
I won't allow any more setbacks.

911
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:12,524
She'll die!

912
01:37:14,228 --> 01:37:17,220
I don't care. I have sons.

913
01:37:18,766 --> 01:37:20,233
Father...

914
01:37:23,871 --> 01:37:25,771
I'm better now.

915
01:37:27,675 --> 01:37:29,302
I'm all better!

916
01:37:58,839 --> 01:38:01,108
We're almost there, Popo. We've got to go down.

917
01:38:01,143 --> 01:38:02,541
No, Palme.

918
01:38:04,578 --> 01:38:06,312
I can't!

919
01:38:06,347 --> 01:38:09,282
What are you saying? After we've come this far?

920
01:38:10,017 --> 01:38:12,383
All we have to do is go down there! C'mon!

921
01:38:16,056 --> 01:38:17,590
Popo! We're going down! Now!

922
01:38:17,625 --> 01:38:18,025
Ow!
Popo! We're going down! Now!

923
01:38:18,060 --> 01:38:18,791
Ow!

924
01:38:18,826 --> 01:38:19,126
Ow!
Soon I'll be human! Don't give
me any more trouble!

925
01:38:19,161 --> 01:38:23,230
Soon I'll be human! Don't give
me any more trouble!

926
01:38:23,265 --> 01:38:25,221
Think more about MY predicament!

927
01:38:26,967 --> 01:38:28,832
Popo! What's the matter?!

928
01:38:29,470 --> 01:38:30,937
P-Popo!

929
01:38:31,472 --> 01:38:34,675
Wh-what's wrong? What is it? C'mon, get up!

930
01:38:34,710 --> 01:38:36,506
Popo! Popo!

931
01:38:37,044 --> 01:38:40,036
What do I do? What do I do?
What am I going to do?

932
01:38:44,752 --> 01:38:46,219
Damn these things!

933
01:38:50,658 --> 01:38:52,558
Tamas is down there.

934
01:38:53,227 --> 01:38:55,029
It's pitch-black!

935
01:38:55,064 --> 01:38:56,496
Look!

936
01:39:03,103 --> 01:39:07,938
Soon I'll be human, then I can
be with Popo forever!

937
01:39:17,851 --> 01:39:19,944
Father! Father!

938
01:39:20,821 --> 01:39:22,083
Father!

939
01:39:23,490 --> 01:39:25,685
I warned you about the storm!

940
01:39:25,926 --> 01:39:27,985
Gandel! Hang in there!

941
01:39:29,663 --> 01:39:32,466
It's no use. His foot's caught in the roots!

942
01:39:32,501 --> 01:39:33,832
Someone get down there!

943
01:39:33,867 --> 01:39:34,268
I'll do it!
Someone get down there!

944
01:39:34,303 --> 01:39:35,000
I'll do it!

945
01:39:35,035 --> 01:39:35,369
I'll do it!
Koram!

946
01:39:35,404 --> 01:39:36,495
Koram!

947
01:39:38,305 --> 01:39:41,706
Just a little bit more, Father! Just a little bit!

948
01:39:46,580 --> 01:39:47,546
OK! He's free!

949
01:39:47,581 --> 01:39:48,082
Now! Heave!
OK! He's free!

950
01:39:48,117 --> 01:39:49,048
Now! Heave!

951
01:39:49,083 --> 01:39:49,249
Now! Heave!
Heave!

952
01:39:49,284 --> 01:39:50,341
Heave!

953
01:39:56,056 --> 01:39:57,614
Well done, Koram!

954
01:39:59,226 --> 01:40:00,955
Father! Are you all right?

955
01:40:04,031 --> 01:40:05,498
Gandel!

956
01:40:10,738 --> 01:40:12,205
Father!

957
01:40:12,973 --> 01:40:16,136
How could I have been so careless?

958
01:40:24,985 --> 01:40:26,452
Father...

959
01:40:27,154 --> 01:40:28,621
Father...

960
01:40:46,273 --> 01:40:47,740
That smells nice...

961
01:40:57,951 --> 01:41:02,081
I like you just the way you are, Palme.
The way you are right now.

962
01:41:03,924 --> 01:41:05,391
Can you walk?

963
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:07,659
Palme! Your arm!

964
01:41:07,694 --> 01:41:10,925
It's nothing. I just got too much sun on it.

965
01:41:21,008 --> 01:41:22,600
Popo!

966
01:41:26,380 --> 01:41:27,847
Palme!

967
01:41:39,359 --> 01:41:40,826
Baron!

968
01:41:53,307 --> 01:41:56,577
It's definitely there! It's reacting
to a very strong will!

969
01:41:56,612 --> 01:41:58,909
Quick, before Soma notices!

970
01:42:05,752 --> 01:42:09,523
Don't take the Egg! Please! Stop!

971
01:42:09,558 --> 01:42:11,991
I need it to become human!

972
01:42:12,426 --> 01:42:18,387
Popo, help! Where are you, Popo?!

973
01:42:20,701 --> 01:42:23,864
It's all right. We're just taking out the capsule.

974
01:42:26,273 --> 01:42:27,740
Palme...

975
01:42:29,243 --> 01:42:33,179
I heard that my mother left Tamas
when she was a baby.

976
01:42:34,081 --> 01:42:37,651
We've risked our lives to bring that capsule here!

977
01:42:37,686 --> 01:42:41,755
I'm amazed you brought the Egg of Touto.

978
01:42:41,790 --> 01:42:45,824
How ironic for the brave warriors of Sol!

979
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:48,027
Watch your mouth!

980
01:42:49,329 --> 01:42:50,796
What's that?!

981
01:42:53,534 --> 01:42:55,714
What's that noise? Is it Soma?!

982
01:42:55,749 --> 01:42:57,895
Captain! It's coming from the lab!

983
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:14,687
Popo!

984
01:43:15,856 --> 01:43:17,323
Palme!

985
01:43:22,930 --> 01:43:25,264
Was it that puppet?!

986
01:43:25,299 --> 01:43:29,235
What about the capsule?
Didn't you get it? Find it!

987
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:31,766
He's going to see Soma!

988
01:43:46,486 --> 01:43:47,953
Palme?

989
01:43:54,027 --> 01:43:55,619
Shatta!

990
01:43:55,996 --> 01:43:58,260
Did you do this?

991
01:43:59,299 --> 01:44:01,833
Help me!

992
01:44:01,868 --> 01:44:03,529
Answer me! Palme!

993
01:44:16,917 --> 01:44:20,683
Father! Where are you?!

994
01:44:24,625 --> 01:44:26,092
Mother!

995
01:44:27,461 --> 01:44:29,053
What's happened?!

996
01:44:30,764 --> 01:44:32,231
It can't be!

997
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:34,867
Palme!

998
01:44:42,709 --> 01:44:44,176
Popo...

999
01:44:45,846 --> 01:44:49,942
Let's go see Soma.

1000
01:44:55,889 --> 01:44:57,481
Popo!

1001
01:44:58,525 --> 01:45:00,390
No! No!

1002
01:45:01,161 --> 01:45:02,822
Stop, Palme!

1003
01:45:04,531 --> 01:45:08,331
I'm sorry, but I can't let you go see Soma.

1004
01:45:10,270 --> 01:45:15,731
Besides, what's inside that capsule
you've got isn't the soul of Touto!

1005
01:45:16,476 --> 01:45:19,179
Soma won't take it.

1006
01:45:19,214 --> 01:45:20,612
Palme!

1007
01:45:22,049 --> 01:45:26,645
You're lying! Soma said he was waiting for me!

1008
01:45:26,753 --> 01:45:31,781
Listen, Palme... it's my mother
who's in that capsule.

1009
01:45:31,958 --> 01:45:33,926
The spirit of my dead mother!

1010
01:45:41,468 --> 01:45:43,095
Stop it, Shatta!

1011
01:45:43,904 --> 01:45:47,974
Look! I've got the capsule!

1012
01:45:48,009 --> 01:45:50,008
So I'm going!

1013
01:45:50,043 --> 01:45:53,240
I'm sick and tired of being a stupid puppet!

1014
01:45:53,275 --> 01:45:56,438
I'm going to become a strong man like you!

1015
01:45:57,184 --> 01:45:59,744
I'm going to become human for Popo's sake.

1016
01:46:00,020 --> 01:46:03,114
I want to stay by her side forever!

1017
01:46:06,059 --> 01:46:09,586
Please! Let me become human!

1018
01:46:11,098 --> 01:46:12,565
Palme!

1019
01:46:14,968 --> 01:46:16,435
No, Palme.

1020
01:46:16,970 --> 01:46:21,839
My mother's spirit is crazy.
You can't give that to Soma.

1021
01:46:24,411 --> 01:46:27,346
Come on, Palme, let's go...

1022
01:46:27,714 --> 01:46:29,511
let's go to see Soma.

1023
01:46:30,217 --> 01:46:31,683
Popo!

1024
01:46:31,718 --> 01:46:35,956
What... what are you thinking?! Don't be a fool!

1025
01:46:35,991 --> 01:46:38,256
You're a human! Think!

1026
01:46:38,291 --> 01:46:41,522
You've heard what's happening in Tamas!

1027
01:46:42,229 --> 01:46:44,720
We can't let Laala be born!

1028
01:46:45,432 --> 01:46:48,128
Stop or I'll cut you down!

1029
01:46:50,637 --> 01:46:54,368
Don't you care what happens
here Below?! People will die!

1030
01:46:56,376 --> 01:46:59,641
Don't listen to that... that damn puppet!

1031
01:47:00,414 --> 01:47:03,144
Palme isn't a puppet.

1032
01:47:06,753 --> 01:47:09,244
You... you!

1033
01:47:26,106 --> 01:47:27,573
Look!

1034
01:47:43,056 --> 01:47:45,752
Quick! Soma's mobilizing!

1035
01:47:46,193 --> 01:47:49,424
When you find that puppet, destroy it
along with the capsule!

1036
01:48:27,033 --> 01:48:28,500
Palme!

1037
01:48:28,535 --> 01:48:30,196
Popo, we've got to hurry!

1038
01:48:42,983 --> 01:48:45,213
Father, where are you?!

1039
01:48:46,253 --> 01:48:51,623
I did... what my brothers couldn't.

1040
01:48:52,125 --> 01:48:54,320
I did it!

1041
01:48:55,462 --> 01:48:56,929
Father!

1042
01:48:57,597 --> 01:48:59,064
Father!

1043
01:49:02,435 --> 01:49:03,936
Popo!

1044
01:49:03,971 --> 01:49:05,437
Palme!

1045
01:49:21,588 --> 01:49:23,488
My body!

1046
01:49:37,470 --> 01:49:38,903
Soma!

1047
01:49:54,654 --> 01:49:56,121
Run!

1048
01:50:06,700 --> 01:50:08,065
Damn!

1049
01:50:08,301 --> 01:50:13,034
It's as though we're living inside of
Soma! There's no way we can win!

1050
01:50:16,943 --> 01:50:19,503
Popo! Popo!

1051
01:50:21,748 --> 01:50:24,182
Palme! Hang in there!

1052
01:50:28,288 --> 01:50:29,755
Fight it, Palme!

1053
01:50:37,831 --> 01:50:41,062
I want... to be human...

1054
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:48,871
Popo!

1055
01:50:50,877 --> 01:50:53,880
Come on, Palme! Keep fighting!
Just a little more!

1056
01:50:53,915 --> 01:50:55,541
It's not much farther!

1057
01:51:09,029 --> 01:51:10,496
Palme!

1058
01:51:10,997 --> 01:51:12,828
Please! Stand up!

1059
01:51:17,203 --> 01:51:21,105
Soma's waiting! You're going to become human!

1060
01:51:25,645 --> 01:51:28,515
No! Don't turn into a tree!

1061
01:51:28,550 --> 01:51:29,982
No! No!

1062
01:51:30,350 --> 01:51:31,850
No!

1063
01:51:31,885 --> 01:51:36,256
You said you'd become a human
for me, Palme! Come on!

1064
01:51:36,291 --> 01:51:37,951
Palme!

1065
01:51:38,925 --> 01:51:40,392
It's alright.

1066
01:51:41,227 --> 01:51:42,888
No! No!

1067
01:51:45,398 --> 01:51:48,993
That's enough! That's enough! Popo!

1068
01:51:55,308 --> 01:51:56,900
The girl will be caught in the fight!

1069
01:51:57,510 --> 01:52:00,707
The closer they get to Soma,
the less options we'll have.

1070
01:52:14,694 --> 01:52:16,389
Where's my father?!

1071
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:19,592
Where did you hide him?!

1072
01:52:20,667 --> 01:52:24,330
You must know! I want to see him!

1073
01:52:29,609 --> 01:52:32,578
I'll go the rest of the way myself.

1074
01:52:36,216 --> 01:52:37,615
It's okay.

1075
01:52:38,251 --> 01:52:42,551
This is my punishment. It was
me who killed that baby aguri.

1076
01:52:44,190 --> 01:52:47,318
I can't stay with you.

1077
01:52:47,961 --> 01:52:52,921
No! I'll follow you wherever you go!
I'll stay with you always!

1078
01:53:10,049 --> 01:53:12,347
Answer me, Soma!

1079
01:53:12,986 --> 01:53:16,922
Show me my father! Don't hide him from me!

1080
01:53:24,864 --> 01:53:26,422
The blast! It stopped?!

1081
01:53:27,100 --> 01:53:28,567
Palme!

1082
01:53:37,710 --> 01:53:39,075
It's Palme!

1083
01:54:03,236 --> 01:54:05,932
Is that what was in the capsule?!

1084
01:54:12,178 --> 01:54:15,147
No! That's the Sol woman!

1085
01:54:17,050 --> 01:54:18,483
Mother!

1086
01:54:22,088 --> 01:54:26,693
Don't let it get near Soma until we're
sure the capsule's destroyed!

1087
01:54:26,728 --> 01:54:28,160
Yes ma'am!

1088
01:54:51,784 --> 01:54:52,773
Palme!

1089
01:54:55,855 --> 01:54:57,288
Bolas!

1090
01:54:59,759 --> 01:55:01,693
Where did they all come from?!

1091
01:55:10,503 --> 01:55:13,404
It's my mother. They're heading for my mother!

1092
01:55:18,811 --> 01:55:20,711
We're being overrun by the bugs!

1093
01:55:27,921 --> 01:55:29,081
Popo!

1094
01:55:38,464 --> 01:55:39,931
Palme!

1095
01:55:39,999 --> 01:55:41,332
Popo!

1096
01:55:41,367 --> 01:55:41,501
Stop!
Popo!

1097
01:55:41,536 --> 01:55:42,166
Stop!

1098
01:55:42,201 --> 01:55:42,869
Stop!
Popo, you'll die!

1099
01:55:42,904 --> 01:55:44,029
Popo, you'll die!

1100
01:55:44,570 --> 01:55:47,334
Please! Take me to the top of Palme!

1101
01:55:55,448 --> 01:55:57,848
It's going into Soma's forest!

1102
01:56:20,073 --> 01:56:22,064
Palme! Can you hear me?

1103
01:56:23,276 --> 01:56:24,743
Palme!

1104
01:56:30,516 --> 01:56:33,349
Please! Answer me!

1105
01:56:55,208 --> 01:56:57,176
It's so quiet...

1106
01:56:58,644 --> 01:57:02,705
This place is just so quiet.

1107
01:57:10,923 --> 01:57:13,915
Someone's crying...

1108
01:57:17,797 --> 01:57:21,665
Who could it be?

1109
01:57:32,779 --> 01:57:34,246
A lute...

1110
01:57:35,148 --> 01:57:38,584
Palme, can you hear me?! Answer me!

1111
01:57:39,385 --> 01:57:43,890
You said we'd go to Xian's hometown! Together!

1112
01:57:43,925 --> 01:57:45,357
Please!

1113
01:57:47,060 --> 01:57:49,858
Come back, Palme!

1114
01:57:55,568 --> 01:57:56,830
I love you...

1115
01:58:11,884 --> 01:58:14,011
You don't have to do anything.

1116
01:58:15,188 --> 01:58:16,780
Just be with me.

1117
01:58:18,991 --> 01:58:20,720
Just stay here.

1118
01:58:21,994 --> 01:58:23,461
Palme...

1119
01:58:24,764 --> 01:58:26,231
Popo!

1120
01:58:52,558 --> 01:58:55,186
Why didn't I realize it before?

1121
01:58:57,597 --> 01:58:59,656
It's not the body that matters.

1122
01:59:00,500 --> 01:59:03,697
All I need is the heart Xian gave me.

1123
01:59:05,738 --> 01:59:10,198
As long as I have that, Popo
will always be with me.

1124
01:59:12,378 --> 01:59:13,845
Look, Palme!

1125
01:59:14,714 --> 01:59:16,978
The lilias are blooming again.

1126
01:59:19,685 --> 01:59:21,209
You're right.

1127
01:59:24,090 --> 01:59:27,856
You smell like flowers, Popo.

1128
01:59:37,603 --> 01:59:39,070
Palme?

1129
01:59:41,807 --> 01:59:45,800
I heard your voice, Popo.

1130
02:00:18,311 --> 02:00:19,210
What are you doing?!

1131
02:00:19,245 --> 02:00:19,812
Save that girl!
What are you doing?!

1132
02:00:19,847 --> 02:00:21,040
Save that girl!

1133
02:01:09,762 --> 02:01:11,229
Grab on!

1134
02:01:12,665 --> 02:01:14,832
Palme! Help her!

1135
02:01:14,867 --> 02:01:17,301
Help Shatta's mother!

1136
02:01:18,938 --> 02:01:23,204
I know how it feels... because I wanted
my mother to hold me too.

1137
02:01:23,476 --> 02:01:24,943
Popo!

1138
02:01:34,754 --> 02:01:37,780
It was you crying, Koram...

1139
02:01:39,158 --> 02:01:42,491
You're the one who saved me.

1140
02:01:44,063 --> 02:01:46,293
I can't find my father anywhere!

1141
02:01:46,832 --> 02:01:48,697
I'm lost!

1142
02:01:49,669 --> 02:01:52,770
You're just like I was.

1143
02:01:52,805 --> 02:01:57,404
No! You have memories! You
have fond memories!

1144
02:01:57,439 --> 02:02:02,003
But me... I have none... I
have no fond memories!

1145
02:02:17,163 --> 02:02:20,826
I never thought a heart would hurt so much.

1146
02:02:39,418 --> 02:02:40,885
That song...

1147
02:02:43,489 --> 02:02:59,770
I go to the darkness of the white forest's spring

1148
02:03:01,307 --> 02:03:09,078
To rid myself of memories

1149
02:03:10,316 --> 02:03:17,586
Many bitter fruits of the silverberry

1150
02:03:18,891 --> 02:03:26,059
And the sad fruit of the kusupia

1151
02:03:28,067 --> 02:03:39,103
In the garden full of black flowers

1152
02:03:40,846 --> 02:03:49,686
As my tears flow

1153
02:03:50,189 --> 02:03:55,627
It is these I must...

1154
02:04:23,656 --> 02:04:27,922
I did the best I could! I did!

1155
02:04:48,981 --> 02:04:50,748
It's stopped.

1156
02:04:50,783 --> 02:04:52,418
The bolas are leaving.

1157
02:04:52,453 --> 02:04:53,851
Yeah!

1158
02:04:55,454 --> 02:04:56,921
It disappeared!

1159
02:05:08,534 --> 02:05:09,558
Laala!

1160
02:05:24,650 --> 02:05:26,117
Palme!

1161
02:05:51,210 --> 02:05:51,976
It's Palme!

1162
02:05:52,011 --> 02:05:52,711
Palme!
It's Palme!

1163
02:05:52,746 --> 02:05:53,377
Palme!

1164
02:05:53,412 --> 02:05:55,710
Look! He's still got the capsule!

1165
02:06:01,987 --> 02:06:04,114
It's heading for Laala! It's going inside her!

1166
02:06:12,831 --> 02:06:14,298
Palme?

1167
02:06:33,786 --> 02:06:35,481
The negation! It's started!

1168
02:06:58,611 --> 02:07:01,580
The destruction's stopped!

1169
02:07:10,689 --> 02:07:12,156
Shatta...

1170
02:07:12,958 --> 02:07:15,722
I know you're there, Shatta.

1171
02:07:16,795 --> 02:07:18,262
Mother?

1172
02:07:19,131 --> 02:07:20,598
Forgive me.

1173
02:07:21,967 --> 02:07:24,767
I never once held you...

1174
02:07:24,802 --> 02:07:27,567
Mother! Mother! Mother!!

1175
02:08:13,786 --> 02:08:14,652
Palme!

1176
02:08:14,687 --> 02:08:15,287
Popo!
Palme!

1177
02:08:15,322 --> 02:08:16,151
Popo!

1178
02:08:42,214 --> 02:08:43,681
Soma's dead!

1179
02:09:00,065 --> 02:09:02,499
Pools of crosskahla oil...

1180
02:09:05,437 --> 02:09:07,064
There's so much of it...

1181
02:09:17,583 --> 02:09:20,575
You didn't become human, Palme.

1182
02:09:21,453 --> 02:09:22,886
Nope.

1183
02:09:24,389 --> 02:09:25,856
Popo...

1184
02:09:27,092 --> 02:09:29,458
I'm turning back into a tree.

1185
02:09:31,330 --> 02:09:35,767
But wherever you are, I'll be watching over you.

1186
02:09:47,780 --> 02:09:50,374
I'll always be with you.

1187
02:09:50,783 --> 02:09:55,686
I wonder if the blue of the sky

1188
02:09:55,721 --> 02:09:58,824
Let's go to Xian's hometown.
I wonder if the blue of the sky

1189
02:09:58,859 --> 02:09:59,324
I wonder if the blue of the sky

1190
02:09:59,359 --> 02:09:59,423
Will remain in my heart

1191
02:09:59,458 --> 02:10:01,076
Okay.
Will remain in my heart

1192
02:10:01,111 --> 02:10:02,694
Popo...
Will remain in my heart

1193
02:10:02,729 --> 02:10:04,495
Will remain in my heart

1194
02:10:04,530 --> 02:10:06,031
Let's go.
Will remain in my heart

1195
02:10:06,066 --> 02:10:08,898
Will remain in my heart

1196
02:10:10,936 --> 02:10:21,005
Even now when everything is lost

1197
02:10:21,079 --> 02:10:21,712
When you have children...

1198
02:10:21,747 --> 02:10:24,283
When you have children...
My heart will be with you

1199
02:10:24,318 --> 02:10:25,616
My heart will be with you

1200
02:10:25,651 --> 02:10:27,286
and they play in the flowers,
the wind, and the stars...
My heart will be with you

1201
02:10:27,321 --> 02:10:30,744
and they play in the flowers,
the wind, and the stars...

1202
02:10:32,257 --> 02:10:37,251
I'll always be watching over them, Popo.

1203
02:10:39,064 --> 02:10:49,473
I'll be with you, always

1204
02:10:49,508 --> 02:11:04,856
I'll protect you like the wind
caressing your shoulders

1205
02:11:15,601 --> 02:11:24,759
If the sunlight is too strong

1206
02:11:24,794 --> 02:11:33,917
I'll raise my arm to block it

1207
02:11:35,721 --> 02:11:45,722
On the day that love envelopes us

1208
02:11:46,398 --> 02:11:51,700
Let's make white flowers bloom

1209
02:11:59,878 --> 02:12:09,987
See a dream, my dream

1210
02:12:10,022 --> 02:12:25,666
And walk without turning back

1211
02:12:46,725 --> 02:12:54,131
When you shed a tear

1212
02:12:57,069 --> 02:13:05,875
I'll bring you the scent of
honey you liked so much

1213
02:13:07,279 --> 02:13:15,118
It shined on your fingers

1214
02:13:37,576 --> 02:13:48,019
I'll be by your side, quietly

1215
02:13:48,054 --> 02:13:58,313
Your smiling face is my happiness

1216
02:13:58,348 --> 02:14:08,538
Reflected in the blue of the sky

1217
02:14:08,573 --> 02:14:18,244
Is the path to the future you believe in

1218
02:14:19,317 --> 02:14:24,482
And it goes on and on

1219
02:15:39,331 --> 02:15:43,233
