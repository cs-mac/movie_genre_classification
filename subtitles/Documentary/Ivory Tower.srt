1
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,991
<i>I've always felt,
when I step onto a college campus,</i>

2
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,869
<i>a slight element of melancholy in the air.</i>

3
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:14,615
<i>If you're a teacher,</i>

4
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:18,003
<i>you arrive every fall semester
for the new year,</i>

5
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,581
<i>and you know
that you've gotten a year older,</i>

6
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:23,213
<i>but the students
are the same age as they always were.</i>

7
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:25,010
<i>They keep replenishing themselves.</i>

8
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,640
<i>College is a way of trying
to preserve cultural memory.</i>

9
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:36,139
<i>It is an effort to cheat death,</i>

10
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:39,896
<i>so it's a kind of struggle
against time and mortality.</i>

11
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:51,116
The United States has managed to
provide a postsecondary education

12
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:55,620
to a larger percentage of its
population than any society in history.

13
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,785
<i>But a lot of forces
are converging</i>

14
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:01,497
<i>at the present moment to create anxiety.</i>

15
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:03,067
<i>Is college overrated?</i>

16
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,046
<i>I'm saying it's</i> a <i>myth.</i>

17
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:07,302
<i>It's become a race
for credentialism.</i>

18
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,799
<i>Has college
become too expensive?</i>

19
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,302
<i>I think it's going to
tum into the foreclosure situation.</i>

20
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,541
<i>Students are gonna default...</i>

21
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:16,395
<i>Every parent who tries
to pay for their child's education</i>

22
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:21,101
<i>is feeling sticker shock,
and access and completion of college</i>

23
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:23,561
<i>are more challenging in our time.</i>

24
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:26,147
<i>Of all the time
bombs in the American economy</i>

25
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,355
<i>set to explode,</i>

26
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,160
<i>student loan debt
in this country has reached $1 trillion.</i>

27
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,828
<i>We may see
a tsunami of student loan defaults.</i>

28
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:38,746
<i>There are problems
in all the sectors of higher education,</i>

29
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,668
<i>and it's</i> a <i>perfectly fair expectation</i>

30
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,496
<i>for students and their families</i>

31
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,502
<i>to want to know
that when they leave college,</i>

32
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,003
<i>they're going to have some skills</i>

33
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,403
that somebody's going to be
willing to compensate them for.

34
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,418
<i>We've got a lot of people</i>

35
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:53,762
<i>with college degrees waiting tables,
cleaning toilets, you know, driving taxis.</i>

36
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,888
<i>Nearly half of all students are showing</i>

37
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:58,265
<i>no significant gains in learning.</i>

38
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:02,892
<i>But there's
an apocalyptic dimension to this as well.</i>

39
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,351
<i>And that is the idea</i>

40
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:07,233
<i>that the very concept of the institution</i>

41
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:10,282
<i>of higher learning is about to be broken.</i>

42
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:16,030
<i>And only a very,
very small handful of colleges</i>

43
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:19,287
<i>will survive intact
on the other side of this tidal wave.</i>

44
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,868
<i>We're at the point
where people are saying,</i>

45
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:21,918
<i>"Maybe you don't have to go to college."</i>

46
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,540
<i>ls college worth it?</i>

47
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:25,627
<i>There have been
moments in human history</i>

48
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:29,006
<i>when those who said the future's
gonna look a lot different very soon</i>

49
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,461
have been right.

50
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:31,837
This might be one of them.

51
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,211
This is the
John Harvard statue.

52
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:15,298
Now, people come
from all over the world

53
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,849
to take pictures with this statue.

54
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,981
<i>In education, there are
these very powerful social forces at work</i>

55
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:27,104
where people just imitate
what other people are doing

56
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:29,562
without reflecting on why they're doing it.

57
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,738
<i>Things like,
"How do you get into the right college?</i>

58
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,657
<i>"How does your kid
get on the right track?"</i>

59
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,866
<i>College has been sold and
over-sold as the key to a better future.</i>

60
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:46,166
<i>And somethings gone very wrong with it
over the last few decades.</i>

61
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,961
Higher education has had
the privilege for a very long time

62
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,087
of being a black box.

63
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,086
<i>It created this prestige
and this mystique around it,</i>

64
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,046
<i>but we've never really
examined very closely</i>

65
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,506
the ingredients on the box.

66
00:04:58,632 --> 00:04:59,758
<i>We need to really rethink,</i>

67
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:02,264
"What are the specific things
that people are learning,

68
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:03,465
"and why are they valuable?"

69
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,684
<i>Welcome, Class of 2016.</i>

70
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,895
<i>You may have sensed that some of us</i>

71
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,275
<i>are expecting you to save the world,</i>

72
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,904
<i>preferably by the time you graduate.</i>

73
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,447
<i>But just remember,</i>

74
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:24,955
<i>a key part of any success
is the part of you that is willing to fail.</i>

75
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,718
<i>We at Harvard
believe that the best</i>

76
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:41,095
<i>Kind of education for undergraduates</i>

77
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,347
<i>is a liberal arts education.</i>

78
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:46,688
And that means a broad education

79
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:49,186
across the fields of human inquiry.

80
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:54,067
<i>We aren't educating students
for a first job.</i>

81
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,364
We want to give them
the abilities to think

82
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,113
and reason and question for a lifetime.

83
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,450
<i>Technology increasingly is something</i>

84
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,408
<i>that every educated person
should be familiar with</i>

85
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,288
<i>in the 21 st century.</i>

86
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,913
<i>We have an introductory
computer science course</i>

87
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:13,169
<i>that is known as CS50,</i>

88
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:15,717
and it is now the largest
undergraduate course on campus.

89
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:20,631
<i>Everyone on
campus knows what CS50 is.</i>

90
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:24,639
It's definitely a course
with a cult following.

91
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,104
I think some of it
is kind of related to the whole Facebook

92
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:30,398
and Mark Zuckerberg being at Harvard.

93
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,225
<i>That's what's
happening for our generation.</i>

94
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,277
<i>People are growing up,
and they're starting their own companies</i>

95
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,070
<i>and creating their own websites,</i>

96
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,865
<i>and doing all this amazing stuff
with technology,</i>

97
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,159
and I think CS50, like, represents that.

98
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,415
<i>Today we begin our exploration</i>

99
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:55,340
<i>of the fundamentals of computer science
and the art of programming.</i>

100
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,417
<i>You will have this very practical skillset</i>

101
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,094
<i>that you can then take back
to all sorts of fields.</i>

102
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,298
<i>And realize, too, it is not so important</i>

103
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,929
<i>where you end up relative to
your classmates in this class,</i>

104
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,602
<i>but where you,
by semester's end in week 11,</i>

105
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,521
<i>end up relative to yourself this very day.</i>

106
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,369
<i>Sometimes it can be intimidating,</i>

107
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:32,544
<i>because there are plenty of people
who have just more preparation.</i>

108
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:38,300
<i>A tot of times, it's really easy to say,
like, "How in the world can I do this?"</i>

109
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:43,055
<i>Because I can't
understand everything right away.</i>

110
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,642
<i>College, it's a completely
different environment</i>

111
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,890
<i>than what I was used to.</i>

112
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,976
<i>My path has been a little bit rough.</i>

113
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,184
I come from a pretty, uh,

114
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,611
modest background.

115
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,443
When I entered ninth grade,
the summer before,

116
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:05,528
<i>I had been, like, enticed to join a gang.
I decided not to.</i>

117
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,410
<i>They retaliated against my entire family,
shooting at my home.</i>

118
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,658
<i>Because of my path
and where I've come from,</i>

119
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,210
<i>I'm just that much more driven.</i>

120
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:15,411
<i>I remember those times,</i>

121
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,293
<i>and it just makes me
all the more grateful</i>

122
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,966
<i>for the things I do have now.</i>

123
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,011
Before I came here
I hadn't had a bed for over a year,

124
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:26,966
and so, like, coming into my dorm,
I legit jumped on my bed.

125
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:30,435
<i>That was something
that meant a lot to me.</i>

126
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,978
It's a real blessing.

127
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:36,229
Just being here alone
has already changed my family dynamic.

128
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:39,986
<i>I always told them,</i>

129
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,904
<i>"In order for us to get ahead as a family,</i>

130
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,525
"each generation
has to do better than the next."

131
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,490
<i>David was, like, "Mom, how are we
going to pay for college?</i>

132
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,617
<i>"What happens if I get in
and I can't pay for it?"</i>

133
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:53,625
I said, "Trust me. God will make a way."

134
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,086
<i>You should see the
video when we first got it.</i>

135
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,888
<i>He was sitting there looking at
the camera like he gonna be a star.</i>

136
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:10,558
When we got on Harvard's campus,
I mean, I was just like,

137
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,728
"My baby is at Harvard."

138
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:23,735
<i>The first American college,
Harvard College,</i>

139
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:27,659
<i>was a child of
the University of Cambridge in England.</i>

140
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:33,078
<i>The Puritans had come over
to New England in the early 1630s,</i>

141
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:37,127
<i>and after they settled the basics
of food and shelter,</i>

142
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:40,502
<i>they turned their attention
to starting a college.</i>

143
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:44,797
<i>In that sense the college
was an offshoot of the Church.</i>

144
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:49,340
<i>The lecture,
so central to college education,</i>

145
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,892
<i>is really a kind of modern version
of the sermon.</i>

146
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:58,728
<i>It was a commitment to the idea
that students could be transformed</i>

147
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:01,686
to lead lives of meaning and purpose.

148
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:07,403
Harvard is the source of DNA

149
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:11,195
for almost all of higher
education in America.

150
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:16,867
<i>It laid out the model
that a university needs to emulate</i>

151
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:21,171
in order to get better resources,
better professors,

152
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,965
better credentials, better students.

153
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,884
<i>As Harvard passed that DNA
down to everybody else,</i>

154
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,054
it created a race.

155
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:40,516
<i>When the colonial colleges
started to become universities,</i>

156
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:44,899
<i>and when brand-new institutions
were founded as universities,</i>

157
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:48,698
you begin to see a tension developing

158
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:53,495
between the mission
to educate young people,

159
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,914
<i>and the competition for prestige,</i>

160
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,368
<i>to out-build your rivals.</i>

161
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:08,002
American colleges are driven
by the pursuit of prestige.

162
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:13,139
<i>And the way you get prestige
is that you get the highest ranking,</i>

163
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:17,560
<i>which expands your market,
and allows you to charge more.</i>

164
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:23,020
So, in order to go up the ladder,

165
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:29,485
everybody has to keep adding more
programs and more facilities

166
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:32,192
at a faster rate than the competitors.

167
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:36,405
This really was the most
sort of grandiose vision

168
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:37,687
of what a university could be,

169
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,621
that it was a place of higher learning,
it was a place of research.

170
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,623
It covered every single discipline
under the sun,

171
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,876
<i>and there really
was no end to its expansion.</i>

172
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,582
<i>And that became the model,</i>

173
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,667
<i>you had to integrate doing research.</i>

174
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:53,096
<i>You needed to provide the housing,
the classrooms,</i>

175
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:54,548
<i>all the food that they needed,</i>

176
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:58,932
<i>and the facilities that are required
in order to play in the game.</i>

177
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,183
And that's a tough game to keep playing.

178
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:12,695
<i>The system
of elite residential higher education</i>

179
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:16,404
<i>that Americans assembled
over the course of the last centuries,</i>

180
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:20,707
is extraordinarily effective.
Nobody disputes that.

181
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,581
But it's also extraordinarily inefficient

182
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,913
in terms of the resources
that are expended

183
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,214
to produce these spectacular places.

184
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,885
<i>Higher education in America</i>

185
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,840
<i>has been very successful for centuries.</i>

186
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:39,051
<i>But now things are changing,</i>

187
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:42,182
because the scale
and the cost is enormous.

188
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:48,269
<i>We have a product that is so expensive
that a lot of people can't pay for it</i>

189
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:52,822
<i>and they have to go into debt,
and it just isn't viable.</i>

190
00:12:56,401 --> 00:13:00,326
<i>The rise
in student tuition is unsustainable.</i>

191
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:03,625
<i>We cannot continue
to charge significantly</i>

192
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,543
<i>more year after year after year</i>

193
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,713
<i>without running into
some kind of a brick wall.</i>

194
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,751
College tuition has increased more
than any other good or service

195
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:15,758
in the entire US economy since 1978.

196
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,595
<i>We're in an environment</i>

197
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:24,270
<i>where we're cutting spending
for higher education.</i>

198
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,689
<i>The states have
essentially walked away.</i>

199
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,984
They have this great thing in colleges
and universities called tuition,

200
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,811
and it's been a great release valve.

201
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,156
<i>As appropriations
have gone down in the states,</i>

202
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,108
<i>tuition at public colleges has gone up.</i>

203
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:43,748
We've lost $100 million in funding,

204
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,917
and the board has replaced

205
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,245
one out of every four
of those dollars with tuition.

206
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:55,010
<i>Far more of the cost of education
is now borne by the student.</i>

207
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:59,264
Student loans are certainly a really
important part of this equation, too.

208
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:03,351
<i>The availability
of student loans to pay for college</i>

209
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,724
<i>makes families
less sensitive to the price,</i>

210
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:09,103
<i>makes colleges less likely
to compete on the price.</i>

211
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:12,151
All of the competition has been,

212
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:16,072
"We are better than we used to be,
and we're better than you."

213
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,444
<i>Universities are
driven by perks wars.</i>

214
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:25,619
<i>One offers an amenity,
and they all have to offer the amenity.</i>

215
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,368
<i>They're adding the climbing wails,</i>

216
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:30,499
<i>and they're adding
the plasma screen TVs.</i>

217
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:31,625
<i>We're getting to the point</i>

218
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,127
where we're gonna have
a swimming pool in every room.

219
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:38,169
<i>They have pools with
tanning ledges, they have tanning beds.</i>

220
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,846
<i>The student tells us,
"I can take a five-hour bubble bath,</i>

221
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:42,549
<i>"and no one will complain."</i>

222
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:44,976
<i>There's</i> a <i>massive construction boom</i>

223
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,429
<i>on US colleges and universities today.</i>

224
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:49,981
It's an arms race,
if you will, in higher education.

225
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,308
<i>It's a feeding frenzy</i>

226
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:55,567
<i>to have a better student center,
a bigger football stadium.</i>

227
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,818
<i>Sometimes it can be grotesque.</i>

228
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,274
<i>What we've really seen is,
I think,</i>

229
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:00,797
<i>colleges have kind of lost their way</i>

230
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,490
<i>about who they are and what they are,</i>

231
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,287
<i>and they've turned into
these large businesses</i>

232
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:07,240
<i>that have structures around them.</i>

233
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,166
<i>They're mini cities.</i>

234
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:12,837
Families do desire a lot of the amenities
that colleges have provided.

235
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,164
The proverbial rock wall.

236
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,420
<i>To sustain those, colleges have to</i>

237
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,922
<i>borrow more money,
they have to charge more tuition.</i>

238
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,675
To pay $60,000 for a college tuition...

239
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:26,301
<i>You give momentum to this notion
of the student as customer</i>

240
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:30,764
when you charge them
so much money for their education.

241
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:33,934
<i>We tend to focus a tot
on student debt,</i>

242
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,393
<i>but over this last decade,</i>

243
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:38,112
<i>institutions themselves,
college and universities,</i>

244
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,906
<i>doubled the amount of debt
that they took on.</i>

245
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:43,576
And in fact we've seen
more people be hired

246
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,528
that never step foot in a classroom,

247
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,831
and that's where a lot of the rising
cost of college has come.

248
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:58,046
<i>Administrations seem
often to be the tail wagging the dog.</i>

249
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:02,303
<i>Some of our leading presidents
can be quite shameless</i>

250
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,472
<i>in the size of their compensation.</i>

251
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,844
<i>We're now starting
to question what we're buying.</i>

252
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:12,430
Are you really buying a better,
higher-quality education?

253
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:26,077
It used to be,
you'd get to a public university,

254
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,825
it wouldn't cost very much to go there.

255
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:30,748
The University of California
used to have no tuition.

256
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,326
The tuition costs here in Arizona
used to be near zero.

257
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:37,585
<i>And we need to get back to the point
where it's not a huge economic barrier</i>

258
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:42,760
<i>that you have to get over to gain access
to a world-class university education.</i>

259
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:45,801
<i>As a public university, our responsibility</i>

260
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,259
<i>is to take a broad cross-section
of talent from around our society,</i>

261
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,765
<i>move it forward with world-class
learning experiences</i>

262
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,972
<i>at the lowest possible cost.</i>

263
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:55,856
A lot of people would say
that's not possible.

264
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,941
We say it needs to be possible.

265
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,482
ASU was ranked
<i>as</i> one of the top

266
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:01,938
public research universities,

267
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,365
but it also has another ranking
that many people think...

268
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,532
Party school.

269
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,827
<i>It's funny, so we laugh about
this party school thing.</i>

270
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:10,997
<i>I mean, we literally laugh about it.</i>

271
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:16,832
Our model for learning is the robed don
at Cambridge or Oxford

272
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:20,882
or the kid on the East Coast in
Boston or New York City or something

273
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:25,133
<i>who's huddled around their lamp light
in the dark winter night.</i>

274
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,009
<i>When you live in a place
with bright sunshine</i>

275
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:29,557
<i>and palm trees and beautiful weather,</i>

276
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,350
<i>people think you can't be too serious,</i>

277
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:34,304
but the whole party school thing
is just bogus.

278
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,081
It's the party school!
Come on, what are we doing right now?

279
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,942
It's paradise, baby! What's not to love?

280
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,403
<i>ASU is</i> a <i>big school,</i>

281
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:45,357
and of course people party and drink

282
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,908
and get crazy and all that stuff. Um...

283
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:50,282
But you don't have to.

284
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,437
They say that ASU is, like,
"one of the top party schools"

285
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,586
according to <i>Playboy</i> or whatever.

286
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,751
<i>The average ASU student</i>

287
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,504
<i>comes to get drunk out of their minds</i>

288
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,382
and be in this sort of, like,
vapid, hedonistic area.

289
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,879
Woo!

290
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:10,715
<i>In 2004 we started looking</i>

291
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:15,304
<i>at the party scene at large,
mid-tier state universities,</i>

292
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:16,387
<i>and how it didn't fit in</i>

293
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,815
what the majority of students
actually need to get out of college.

294
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:23,528
<i>The fact that
college-age kids are having some fun,</i>

295
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,605
<i>that's not really the problem.</i>

296
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:32,321
<i>The problem is institutions are creating
these party pathways through college</i>

297
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:33,950
<i>and take their money,</i>

298
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,124
but don't ask anything
of them academically.

299
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,542
In fact, just give them beer and circuses.

300
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,588
In this moment
of declining state support,

301
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:47,844
students who can pay full,
out-of-state tuition

302
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:53,140
without seeking financial aid
are very important for the university.

303
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:57,061
You've got to cater to these
out-of-state, less-studious students,

304
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,558
who want to party.

305
00:18:58,638 --> 00:18:59,935
We know how to party!

306
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:01,231
We all know how to party!

307
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:17,123
<i>Students from
out-of-state picked a school</i>

308
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:20,042
because of the social life.

309
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,958
<i>Big-time athletics,
the really big Greek system,</i>

310
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:26,132
increasing numbers
of luxury condominium-style living.

311
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:28,426
But that has consequences
for everybody else.

312
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:36,471
<i>The Vue is like one of these
privatized living complexes.</i>

313
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,144
They have these pool parties
every so often,

314
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,815
where everyone just goes
and gets wasted or high or whatever,

315
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,609
and then they just start
these fights in the pool.

316
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:49,648
<i>ASU! ASU! ASU!</i>

317
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,914
ASU students
romanticize staying

318
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,117
at this "private apartment complex"

319
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,044
<i>where you hang out
by the pool and smoke cigars,</i>

320
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,748
When ideally you should be
focusing on your schooling

321
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:09,129
<i>and actually getting a diploma.</i>

322
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,177
<i>36% of the kids in our study say</i>

323
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:18,351
they studied less than
five hours per week,

324
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:19,723
less than an hour a day.

325
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:20,928
Full-time college students.

326
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:26,192
<i>Half the kids in our study said
they didn't have a single class</i>

327
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:28,065
<i>where they wrote more than 20 pages.</i>

328
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:32,611
We are confronting
a situation in this country

329
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,819
where, for large numbers of students,

330
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:39,075
they are not doing much
of anything academically.

331
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:43,626
<i>There's</i> a <i>lot of distractions here,</i>

332
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:46,295
<i>and there's no one holding your hand.</i>

333
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,214
<i>Some people,
they're not ready for the college level.</i>

334
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,290
They fail classes,

335
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:53,211
or they withdraw, drop classes
midway through the semester

336
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:54,762
because they're not
doing so good in them.

337
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:56,430
And they get discouraged
by the fourth year,

338
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,348
and they drop out

339
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,677
or they just don't
have the motivation to continue.

340
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,387
<i>I mentor freshmen.</i>

341
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,470
<i>You try to give them tips.</i>

342
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,937
<i>You try to give them a way
to study more efficiently.</i>

343
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:11,362
<i>You try to give them ways
to do their homework in a better method.</i>

344
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:19,700
You know, it's really easy
to fall back into that trap.

345
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,372
Keep the mindset
that you've got to graduate,

346
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,040
you've got to do good in college
to be successful. Right?

347
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,617
That mindset.

348
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:32,504
<i>Many of these actors
in higher education</i>

349
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,961
<i>do not have a fundamental interest</i>

350
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:38,139
<i>in promoting academic rigor
and student learning.</i>

351
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,807
They're focused on something else.

352
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:44,641
<i>Faculty today are increasingly rewarded</i>

353
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,974
<i>in terms of promotion,
tenure, compensation</i>

354
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:50,901
<i>by their research
productivity and scholarship.</i>

355
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:55,948
A focus on teaching can get in the way
of one's research and scholarship.

356
00:21:56,774 --> 00:22:01,120
<i>And when these institutions
assess one's teaching,</i>

357
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:03,414
<i>they typically do it
with course evaluations.</i>

358
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:08,662
<i>At the end of the class, students are
given a consumer satisfaction survey,</i>

359
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,496
"How much did you like the class?"

360
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:13,002
"Would you recommend
this class to a friend?"

361
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:16,256
<i>You're incentivizing
faculty not to be rigorous</i>

362
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,212
<i>but to be actually lenient with grades,</i>

363
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:23,142
<i>because the only measure that the
institutions are paying attention to is,</i>

364
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:25,720
<i>"Are the students happy as consumers?"</i>

365
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,856
<i>At the same time,
the number of full-time faculty</i>

366
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:32,526
<i>in this country is in sharp decline,</i>

367
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:36,276
being replaced
by part-time adjunct instructors.

368
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:39,943
<i>Many of them have limited resources</i>

369
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:43,154
<i>for focusing on
rigorous academic instruction.</i>

370
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:49,457
<i>Institutions invest in these other things,
thinking simply as a business.</i>

371
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:52,379
<i>But these organizations are non-profits.</i>

372
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,001
They're accountable to the public.

373
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:57,176
They're accountable
to fulfilling their mission.

374
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:02,966
<i>It's perfectly
appropriate that we shine a strong light</i>

375
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,346
<i>on America's colleges and universities,</i>

376
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:07,679
<i>and that we demand better of them.</i>

377
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:12,191
We should be outraged
by the abuses and the distortions.

378
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:17,738
<i>But we do not want to erase the
history of higher education and say,</i>

379
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,815
<i>"These places are not about</i>

380
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:22,994
<i>"the formation of character
or self-discovery."</i>

381
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:29,243
<i>There are some colleges that have tried
to go to the far end of the spectrum</i>

382
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:32,454
<i>in terms of the intensity
of the experience.</i>

383
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:35,085
<i>For instance, Deep Springs College,</i>

384
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:37,838
<i>where students
make a two-year commitment</i>

385
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,965
<i>to, in effect, drop out of the world.</i>

386
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,427
<i>The mission
of Deep Springs College</i>

387
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,854
<i>is to provide a free education</i>

388
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:55,192
<i>to young men in preparation
for lives of service to humanity.</i>

389
00:23:57,478 --> 00:24:00,402
<i>That's accomplished through
what are called the three pillars.</i>

390
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:04,827
And those are self-governance
and academics and labor.

391
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,788
<i>We live in this small community.</i>

392
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,865
<i>And we spend half of our time in class</i>

393
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:11,792
<i>and spend the other half of our time</i>

394
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:15,713
<i>working either on the ranch
or in some way for the community.</i>

395
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,128
<i>In committee meetings
throughout the week</i>

396
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,210
<i>we exercise self-governance,</i>

397
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,513
<i>which is basically
taking responsibility for the community.</i>

398
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:27,262
<i>We choose what classes
we're going to take together.</i>

399
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:28,968
We have
Political Theory After Marx,

400
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:31,554
Critical Theory
and the Frankfurt School, Nietzsche.

401
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,643
I think there will be
something incredibly rewarding

402
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:34,939
about going in-depth

403
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:38,440
onto one school
of thought very intensely.

404
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:39,884
<i>Through this education</i>

405
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:43,115
we are, like, putting ourselves
through a grinder of some sort.

406
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:50,532
<i>I cared so little
for the idea of going to college.</i>

407
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,787
<i>It was kind of like Deep Springs
or nothing.</i>

408
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:57,213
<i>It's a place that demands of you
pretty constantly.</i>

409
00:24:58,372 --> 00:24:59,965
<i>And I like that.</i>

410
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:01,842
<i>Because I think
if I'd gone to another college</i>

411
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:05,262
I would become really self-absorbed
and narcissistic.

412
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,013
<i>The main attraction
of Deep Springs for me</i>

413
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:13,061
<i>was self-governance,</i>

414
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:15,310
having to compromise with people,

415
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:18,768
<i>And having to put myself
in other people's positions.</i>

416
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:22,442
<i>And I don't think
that's something natural for us.</i>

417
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,273
<i>I think that that has to be taught.</i>

418
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,279
It has to be the result of an education.

419
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:31,364
<i>The college
classroom is perhaps</i>

420
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:33,916
<i>the best rehearsal space for democracy.</i>

421
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:37,077
<i>Students learn to speak with civility,</i>

422
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:39,835
<i>listen to one another with respect,</i>

423
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,707
<i>and most of all,</i>

424
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,542
<i>they learn that you can actually</i>

425
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:48,256
<i>walk into a room with one point of view
and walk out with another.</i>

426
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,549
Hegel is saying you need to have

427
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,009
a common identity as citizens

428
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,345
because it creates
the bonds of affection.

429
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:57,898
We are not simply sons or brothers,

430
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:01,068
students or doctors, but also citizens.

431
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:04,025
Like, why are we talking
about the state at all?

432
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,823
Expression of the individual
through the state, I don't feel that.

433
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:08,939
That's because
you're treated like a person already.

434
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:11,995
What's being defined <i>as</i> personhood

435
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:15,075
has previously been
exactly the mode in which we have kept,

436
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:18,001
you know, entire races of people
outside of the state,

437
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:19,203
so I agree with you in the sense,

438
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,287
why are we talking about the state

439
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:23,169
when, like, its definition of personhood

440
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:25,334
isn't good enough here?

441
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:26,926
But you recognize

442
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,755
that Hegel can be read against
that argument very effectively?

443
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,090
Right, yeah, I agree.

444
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:33,392
But sometimes I think the best way
to bring Hegel into the new day

445
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:34,684
is to transgress him.

446
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:40,058
<i>Students actually
have</i> a <i>lot to learn from each other.</i>

447
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:45,856
<i>But what I think of
as the most transformative events</i>

448
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:49,363
<i>are, really, at the end of the day,
one-on-one experiences</i>

449
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:52,741
<i>with a teacher who looks you in the eye.</i>

450
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,822
I had a shitty
public school experience. Right?

451
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:58,580
Like, saw lots of racism,
lots of sexism, got beat up, got in fights.

452
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:01,287
Teachers can't do shit.
Families can't do shit.

453
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,873
I do think
families and teachers can do shit.

454
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:05,458
Every time that I come in here and I say,

455
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,088
"What do you guys think about this?

456
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,794
"Do you want to change
these assignments?

457
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,254
"How do you like these readings?"

458
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,556
I'm trying to give you
opportunities for agency,

459
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:15,805
so that I'm not just simply
treating you <i>as</i> any old students.

460
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:21,857
The purpose of this place is for you
to create what you want here, right?

461
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:24,651
And the problem is
that for you to get what you want,

462
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:26,399
you've got to cooperate
with other people,

463
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,697
which means trying to figure out a
way to communicate your anger

464
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,900
without being antagonistic.

465
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:32,910
Two and a half hours of Hegel.

466
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:37,998
Take a half hour break,
another hour and a half of Lacan.

467
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:40,413
Absolutely. Yeah, I'm happy to.

468
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46,419
<i>Even as Deep Springs seems</i>

469
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:49,047
<i>to become more and more obsolete</i>

470
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:52,255
<i>or more and more
of some kind of idyllic fancy,</i>

471
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,889
there's something there,

472
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:57,969
and everybody feels it,
having been through it.

473
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:01,430
<i>This school stands for something.</i>

474
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,207
<i>Because of America's status</i>

475
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:11,695
<i>as a country that's always reaching for
higher and higher ambition and growth,</i>

476
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:14,117
<i>in the 19th century,
we started to have this idea</i>

477
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:18,289
<i>that a university education could be
of benefit to absolutely everyone,</i>

478
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,207
<i>that we should be able to all
have the learning that we need</i>

479
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:25,208
<i>to have self-respect,
to be able to support ourselves,</i>

480
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:27,540
and also to be able to be full citizens.

481
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:32,712
<i>That idea really culminated
in the Morrill Act in the 1860s.</i>

482
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,392
<i>In the middle of
the Civil War, in 1862,</i>

483
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:41,141
<i>Congress of the United States,</i>

484
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:46,351
<i>amazingly enough, found focus and
attention to pass the Morrill Act,</i>

485
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,527
<i>which funded the {and grant colleges</i>

486
00:28:48,602 --> 00:28:51,651
<i>that later became
the great state universities.</i>

487
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:54,275
<i>The federal government provided</i>

488
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:57,157
<i>for the expansion
of this dream of higher education</i>

489
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,284
<i>at an unprecedented scale.</i>

490
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:02,489
<i>This had never happened before
in any human society</i>

491
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:05,251
<i>that we'd have institutions
of higher learning coast-to-coast,</i>

492
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:07,671
<i>and it wouldn't just be for the nobility.</i>

493
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:11,592
<i>Senator Merrill believed in
education even for the sons of slaves,</i>

494
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:13,260
<i>creating, post-Reconstruction,</i>

495
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:16,305
<i>the historically
black colleges and universities.</i>

496
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:20,681
<i>Institutions arose at a time
when we had racial segregation</i>

497
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,352
<i>and we had gender segregation</i>

498
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:25,814
<i>to ensure that black Americans
and female Americans</i>

499
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,391
<i>could get</i> a <i>higher education.</i>

500
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:31,062
<i>Spelman College
was founded less than 20 years</i>

501
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,612
<i>after the end of slavery</i>

502
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:35,237
with the idea of creating
educational opportunity

503
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:36,942
for women who had had none.

504
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,911
It's a place where
a young woman can say,

505
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:41,830
"This place was built for me."

506
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,746
<i>I am a testimony.</i>

507
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:52,584
<i>Every Spelman student</i>

508
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,381
<i>is a testimony.</i>

509
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,468
<i>A testimony of prayers during slavery.</i>

510
00:29:58,547 --> 00:29:59,719
Slavery.

511
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,471
<i>They themselves had been denied...</i>

512
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,597
<i>Denied.</i>

513
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:04,644
<i>- ...education.
- Education.</i>

514
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:11,986
<i>As it had been prophesied.</i>

515
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,232
<i>Prophesied!</i>

516
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:25,012
<i>One of the major
things I think you get from</i>

517
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:28,327
being a young black student
at a historically black college is that

518
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:32,916
you get to have those conversations
about race and about gender,

519
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:34,420
<i>how the two fit together</i>

520
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:38,595
<i>and then how that affects
What you're thinking, how you're feeling.</i>

521
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,672
When you're in a place for four years

522
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:43,054
where there's people
who look like you, and they're achieving,

523
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:47,013
<i>it does do something
for your own confidence.</i>

524
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:50,269
So it's really a space
where you can grow as a person.

525
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:57,305
<i>I went to The Winsor School in Boston,</i>

526
00:30:57,314 --> 00:30:59,487
<i>and it's predominantly white.</i>

527
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:03,328
<i>Coming from a minority experience
to a majority experience,</i>

528
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:07,954
I think it forces me
to find an identity other than the obvious.

529
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:11,412
At my high school, you know,
"Who's Amirah?" "She's the black girl."

530
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:14,711
<i>Here I have to really figure it out.</i>

531
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:18,135
<i>There are so many other
intelligent black women here.</i>

532
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:26,931
<i>College, being</i>
a <i>place of mental growth,</i>

533
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,354
<i>simultaneously can be
a place of spiritual growth,</i>

534
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,769
<i>because the two really go hand-in-hand.</i>

535
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:34,939
Glory!

536
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:40,028
<i>My sense of self is stronger,
and it's really helped cultivate who I am.</i>

537
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:45,700
<i>God's a-gonna trouble the water</i>

538
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:51,161
<i>So wade in the water</i>

539
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:58,083
<i>Children</i>

540
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:02,254
<i>I do think you can get that
experience without going to college.</i>

541
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,886
<i>You can travel the world
and get that experience.</i>

542
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:09,261
<i>You can merely migrate from your
hometown and get that experience.</i>

543
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:13,190
But college is a place
where that all comes together in one.

544
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:19,905
<i>Historically black colleges
are very powerful.</i>

545
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:25,532
They have a strong connection
between the students, the alumni,

546
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,454
and the other
fellow historically black colleges.

547
00:32:29,573 --> 00:32:35,205
<i>But for me, in particular,
I didn't apply to many HBCUs.</i>

548
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:39,003
<i>I've been around
black people my entire life.</i>

549
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:44,338
I went to a school that was more than,
like, 90% African-American.

550
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,135
I didn't know how
to interact with white people,

551
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,306
and I was afraid.

552
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:52,764
<i>The biggest thing, I think, that I've been
able to pick up while being at Harvard</i>

553
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:56,896
<i>is the ability to connect with people
from all different walks of life.</i>

554
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,693
I don't want to just
impact my community.

555
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:01,692
I wanna be able
to impact the larger community.

556
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:06,656
<i>All of these institutions
have made immense contributions</i>

557
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:08,578
to the history of our democracy.

558
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:13,868
<i>And if you cannot have a democracy
without an educated citizenry,</i>

559
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,702
you want to see
as many citizens as possible

560
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:17,662
get as much education as possible.

561
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:20,644
<i>The philanthropists of the Gilded Age</i>

562
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:23,043
<i>gave us the idea of
mass higher education</i>

563
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:25,254
<i>as a basic human right.</i>

564
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:29,508
<i>Peter Cooper was
this industrialist who believed in</i>

565
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:31,719
education as free as water and air.

566
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:34,688
<i>He founded The Cooper Union,</i>

567
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:37,437
a <i>school of industrial arts
and design in New York City,</i>

568
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:40,736
<i>with the idea
that it would be available to people,</i>

569
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:45,316
<i>no matter what their background,
to study useful and practical arts.</i>

570
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:48,906
<i>But today The Cooper Union
is one of the last examples of</i>

571
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:51,613
a free higher education institution
in the country.

572
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:58,830
A full scholarship
for every enrolled student

573
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:02,212
is the current mission statement
of Cooper Union.

574
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:05,920
<i>Peter Cooper wanted the school</i>

575
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:09,973
to be accessible to the working class,
to women, to people of color.

576
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:13,219
<i>I come from a lower-middle class family.</i>

577
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,395
<i>My parents told me about Cooper.</i>

578
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,519
And when I found out, like I...
I was like obsessed.

579
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,726
I didn't even think
about going anywhere else.

580
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,731
<i>Nowadays, so much is against</i>

581
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:29,239
<i>this 19th-century model
of a free education.</i>

582
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:34,577
Ideologically, financially it's ancient.

583
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,854
<i>When Jamshed Bharucha,
the current president, came into office,</i>

584
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:05,187
<i>he announced to
the Cooper community that</i>

585
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,443
<i>we are running a large deficit</i>

586
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:11,368
and that tuition for the first time
in 154 years would be on the table.

587
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:15,239
Free tuition, it's our mission!

588
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:18,542
<i>The current administration
is trying to say that</i>

589
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:21,871
education as a right is not something
that we should be focusing on.

590
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:27,551
Being free, the financial
model is extremely complicated.

591
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:30,337
<i>You look at the financial
statements and you can see.</i>

592
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,048
<i>An extraordinarily large deficit.</i>

593
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:36,231
I think Peter Cooper
would have wanted us,

594
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:39,263
if we had to talk about tuition,
to be able to talk about it.

595
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:43,359
<i>We all acknowledge
that we're in a financial strait right now,</i>

596
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,985
<i>but the administration
and the board fail to understand</i>

597
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:48,484
<i>how tuition's going to destroy the school.</i>

598
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:07,003
<i>President Bharucha's
come from tuition-charging colleges,</i>

599
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:11,007
<i>and he thinks that we should
become like other colleges.</i>

600
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:15,341
<i>It's covered by normal kinds
of words like sustainability.</i>

601
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,515
<i>I'm here before you</i>

602
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:20,266
<i>because the very survival
of this institution is at stake.</i>

603
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:23,565
<i>We do not have a sustainable budget.</i>

604
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:28,271
If you want free education,
how are you going to structure it?

605
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:32,199
I believe it's not compatible
with small class size,

606
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,526
highly-interpersonal interaction,

607
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:39,331
and with providing
good compensation to people,

608
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:41,625
and I believe in providing
good compensation.

609
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:46,331
The President makes in excess
of $700,000 as total compensation.

610
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:52,219
<i>At a school of only 1,000
students in tight financial times,</i>

611
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:55,763
one would have thought there
would have been some proportionality.

612
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:59,560
I believe the President
of Harvard makes $899,000,

613
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:04,731
and she's overseeing
12,000 faculty, 21,000 students,

614
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:06,399
and $30 billion endowment.

615
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:09,774
She doesn't have a fraction
of the problem we have.

616
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,905
Not a fraction of the problems we have.

617
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:18,283
Apparently we are the Harvard
of Astor Place.

618
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:24,664
<i>I don't think that the model
of free education doesn't work.</i>

619
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:26,416
There's all sorts of things
that got us into this mess,

620
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:29,623
and it wasn't the cost
of educating the students.

621
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:48,809
<i>Most of higher education
believes in growth at all costs,</i>

622
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:51,315
<i>growing their way out of difficulty.</i>

623
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,783
<i>And that becomes rather problematic</i>

624
00:37:56,858 --> 00:38:00,533
<i>when you are building
a building at about $1,000 a square foot,</i>

625
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:04,457
<i>which is more than</i> a <i>luxury hotel.</i>

626
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:07,911
<i>It's possible to have downsized,</i>

627
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:13,751
as <i>Cooper Union has done in 150 years
of ups and downs in the market.</i>

628
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:16,211
<i>But that was not the decision
that was made.</i>

629
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:30,483
Do you think
it was wise to invest in hedge funds

630
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:35,906
and to use the money borrowed
in the $175 million loan for that purpose?

631
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:39,575
You know, I'm not an investment person.
I mean, I'm...

632
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:41,194
Uh...

633
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,397
I'm good at budgets,
but I'm not an investment person.

634
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:45,498
Were they risky decisions?

635
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:47,955
Well, uh.

636
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:50,670
One can ask if they were or not,

637
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:59,342
but there is no question
that loan is a, uh...

638
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:04,476
Yes, a challenge
for the institution to pay back.

639
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:10,265
<i>Cooper Union is faced with a
mortgage payment of $10 million a year.</i>

640
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:14,227
<i>It's a terrible irony that</i>

641
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:17,814
<i>an institution which was
supposed to get people out of debt</i>

642
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:20,650
gets into that kind of debt itself.

643
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,408
<i>The idea that Cooper Union</i>

644
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,205
<i>would think about charging tuition</i>

645
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:31,287
<i>really seemed like such a huge betrayal
and a bellwether of where education is.</i>

646
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:35,044
<i>Students are not seen as
having a right to their education,</i>

647
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:38,798
<i>and institutions sort of feel free
to continue to raise the price.</i>

648
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:41,374
<i>What's happening
to higher education in this country?</i>

649
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:44,140
<i>Why is it seen as being the province
of the rich and the rich alone?</i>

650
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:47,727
<i>People are ignoring all of the functions
that education has served</i>

651
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:50,476
<i>throughout our history as a public good.</i>

652
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,565
<i>Certain economic truths
have become self-evident.</i>

653
00:39:56,644 --> 00:40:00,740
<i>Among these,
the right to a good education.</i>

654
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,567
<i>Right after
the Second World War,</i>

655
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,573
<i>the GI Bill was passed,</i>

656
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,620
<i>which made it possible for men,</i>

657
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:09,700
<i>who would never have been
allowed to walk onto a college campus,</i>

658
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:14,379
<i>except perhaps as members
of the custodial staff or as delivery boys,</i>

659
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:17,424
<i>to actually walk through
the gates as students.</i>

660
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:20,422
<i>Over two million
veterans took advantage of the GI Bill.</i>

661
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:23,755
This was an opportunity that was free,
given by the government.

662
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,387
<i>And it made a difference to
the American middle class.</i>

663
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:30,516
<i>That expansion
of the franchise of higher education</i>

664
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:31,716
was really so unprecedented,

665
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:36,018
and it led directly
to the Higher Education Act of 1965,

666
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:38,399
<i>creating the Federal
student aid programs.</i>

667
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:43,109
<i>This law means that a high school senior</i>

668
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:45,910
<i>can apply to any college</i>

669
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:50,908
<i>and not be turned away
because his family is poor.</i>

SharePirate.Com-Movie Stream and Downloads

671
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:06,056
<i>But the rug was pulled out
from under students in the 1970s.</i>

672
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,883
We shifted from seeing
education as a public good

673
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:10,890
to seeing it exclusively
as a private good.

674
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:15,690
<i>Conservative governors, especially
Governor Reagan of California,</i>

675
00:41:15,765 --> 00:41:17,608
<i>had really run on the idea that</i>

676
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:21,234
<i>higher education was a wasteful
way to spend taxpayer money.</i>

677
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:23,648
<i>Governor Reagan actually said</i>

678
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:26,951
<i>the state should not
subsidize intellectual curiosity.</i>

679
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:29,074
<i>And he ran for president later</i>

680
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:31,201
<i>on a promise to disband
the Department of Education.</i>

681
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:36,123
<i>Certain advisors
started to say that</i>

682
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:39,456
<i>anything of a private advantage
should be paid for.</i>

683
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:43,134
The word free is one of
the most misused words.

684
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,836
We speak of "free education."

685
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,921
Education isn't free. It costs money.

686
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:50,220
<i>If this is something
that is going to be good for individuals</i>

687
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:52,518
<i>to get a job and earn more money,</i>

688
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:55,312
<i>they should finance it
and make the investment themselves.</i>

689
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:58,645
We need to keep government
on the sidelines.

690
00:41:58,725 --> 00:42:03,322
Let the people develop their own skills,
solve their own problems.

691
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:05,774
<i>We stopped expanding
the franchise of higher education,</i>

692
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:07,655
<i>graduation rates stopped rising,</i>

693
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:11,238
<i>and access for the poor
to higher education started going down.</i>

694
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:16,330
<i>In the 1970s, a Pell Grant was
more than enough to pay for tuition</i>

695
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:17,914
<i>at an average state institution.</i>

696
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:22,965
<i>But today</i> a <i>Pell Grant
pays for</i> a <i>fraction of tuition.</i>

697
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:26,970
<i>This led to the growth of
the student loan industry,</i>

698
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:28,513
<i>which ended up being the largest</i>

699
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:30,716
<i>source of money for all of tuition.</i>

700
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:37,897
<i>The student loan program
was never intended to be this large.</i>

701
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,188
<i>We've just hit
an awful milestone.</i>

702
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:46,444
<i>Our nation's combined
student loan debt has now hit $1 trillion.</i>

703
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:50,318
<i>It's now larger than
credit card debt in this country.</i>

704
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:52,779
<i>The average
American student now</i>

705
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:57,663
<i>graduates more than $25,000 in debt.</i>

706
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:00,661
<i>I grew up in a low-income household.</i>

707
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:02,418
<i>I was always told to work hard,</i>

708
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:04,716
<i>and if you follow your dreams,
it will pay off,</i>

709
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:06,668
and if you need to go
into educational debt

710
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:09,129
to achieve those dreams, then so be it.

711
00:43:09,212 --> 00:43:11,840
<i>A couple of months after I graduated,
collectors started calling,</i>

712
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:13,800
<i>and I told them that I could not pay.</i>

713
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,134
<i>Even with a master's,</i>

714
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:18,188
<i>I couldn't get a job
cleaning toilets at a local hotel.</i>

715
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:23,185
I was on food stamps.
I was living off mostly beans and rice.

716
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:36,788
<i>Twenty years ago,
we would have said</i>

717
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:39,708
all the kids who aren't going
to college are being the victims,

718
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:41,411
and now it's actually turning out that

719
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:45,044
a lot of the kids who are going to college
are also the victims.

720
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:48,252
It's like a subprime mortgage
broker that ripped you off

721
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:50,928
and talked you into buying
a house you couldn't afford.

722
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:54,887
<i>Education in some ways
is even more insidious than housing.</i>

723
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:56,593
<i>There actually isn't the same kind of</i>

724
00:43:56,676 --> 00:43:58,303
<i>safety valve in the student loan market</i>

725
00:43:58,386 --> 00:44:00,809
<i>that you see in the mortgage market,
in the sense that</i>

726
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:02,368
<i>there's no such thing as foreclosure,</i>

727
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:05,690
<i>and, in fact,
there's no such thing as bankruptcy.</i>

728
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:08,362
<i>Over half of loans today
are either in deferment,</i>

729
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:10,781
<i>or else they're in default.</i>

730
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:11,983
<i>And when you default
on your student loans,</i>

731
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:14,569
<i>interest is applied to the principal.</i>

732
00:44:14,694 --> 00:44:16,822
And you see, very commonly, things like

733
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:20,329
original balances in the tens and
twenty thousands of dollars

734
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:22,627
ballooning up into
the hundreds of thousands of dollars.

735
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:24,871
Starting off, $78,000.

736
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:32,925
Ending up at $106,000 in interest alone.

737
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:35,006
You're going to be saddled with that debt

738
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:37,308
and that ballooning balance
until the day that you die.

739
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,594
That's the kind of garbage

740
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:43,056
our government is playing
with our young people.

741
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:48,065
The government will make
$184 billion in profits

742
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:50,442
<i>over the next 10 years.</i>

743
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:55,202
All those profits made
off the backs of our kids

744
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:57,278
who are trying to get an education.

745
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,705
I think this whole system stinks.

746
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:01,898
- What do we want?
- Education!

747
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,371
- When do we want it?
- Now!

748
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,798
- What do we want?

749
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:10,633
- When do we want it?
- Now!

750
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:13,211
<i>We cannot continue

751

<i>as an individual issue.</i>

752
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:19,309
<i>We must realize that as a society
we cannot have a generation in debt.</i>

753
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:24,685
<i>Once you hit $50,000
in debt, you need to pause</i>

754
00:45:24,764 --> 00:45:27,938
<i>and take a look at the value
of the education you're getting.</i>

755
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:31,692
<i>You don't want to incur debt
that stops you from investing</i>

756
00:45:31,771 --> 00:45:35,947
<i>in family formation, houses,
cars and children down the road.</i>

757
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:38,824
The value of my education is priceless,

758
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:44,251
but the value of my education
is also not $140,000 in debt.

759
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:45,747
<i>If I do ever have kids,</i>

760
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:49,581
<i>my private loans will be directly
passed to them even if I die.</i>

761
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:52,508
<i>It's just siphoning my dreams away,</i>

762
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:56,008
and I feel bad talking about
any dreams that I have these days,

763
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:58,510
because there's all this talk that

764
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:01,601
Generation Y is so entitled and selfish

765
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:04,976
just for wanting the opportunities
that their parents had.

766
00:46:05,054 --> 00:46:07,102
<i>A lot of the older generations</i>

767
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:09,104
<i>that criticize the millennials</i>

768
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:12,278
<i>grew up in a time
when you could go to a state university</i>

769
00:46:12,353 --> 00:46:14,776
<i>and pay your way through
with summer jobs.</i>

770
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:17,616
<i>These millennial children
then got to college and realized,</i>

771
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:19,444
<i>"Oh, the money's not there to pay for me.</i>

772
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:21,871
<i>"I'm not going to be able to graduate
into a cushy job.</i>

773
00:46:21,946 --> 00:46:26,247
"And in fact, everything that I was told
about the way that the world works

774
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:27,872
"turns out not to be the case."

775
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:31,293
<i>The student debt
crisis coupled with</i>

776
00:46:31,372 --> 00:46:34,717
<i>the rise in tuition rates
over the past 30 years,</i>

777
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:37,170
it's just a perfect
storm, it's a nightmare.

778
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:38,629
<i>We are the students</i>

779
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:40,556
<i>We are the students</i>

780
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:41,928
<i>The mighty, mighty students</i>

781
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:43,392
<i>The mighty, mighty students</i>

782
00:46:46,095 --> 00:46:48,268
After 18 months of intense analysis,

783
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:50,475
the board of trustees voted last week

784
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:53,812
to charge tuition for all undergraduates
admitted to the Cooper Union

785
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:56,397
beginning with the class of 2014.

786
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:03,613
<i>Right after the announcement
was made, I spoke to Jamshed.</i>

787
00:47:03,696 --> 00:47:08,167
<i>Jamshed was, you know,
waving his hands, yelling, cutting us off.</i>

788
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:12,288
<i>Right outside of the school,
there was a lot of grieving.</i>

789
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:14,002
<i>People were angry.</i>

790
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:17,631
<i>You could kind of
feel this chaotic energy.</i>

791
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:20,384
<i>It kind of felt like at any moment
something could happen.</i>

792
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,508
<i>The moments
right before an action starts</i>

793
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:26,970
<i>are the most exciting, also scary.</i>

794
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:30,352
<i>It was a really long planning session.</i>

795
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:33,275
Obviously, they can do these things,
and they can overstep us.

796
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:35,690
They can do that, and they're doing it.

797
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:43,698
<i>We didn't know what to do,</i>

798
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:46,247
<i>but people were like,
"We have to do something.</i>

799
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:49,496
<i>"Let's just go into the President's office.</i>

800
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,002
<i>"We're just going to do it."</i>

801
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:59,419
<i>We went in,
40 or so people, maybe more.</i>

802
00:47:59,502 --> 00:48:01,550
Lawrence? Lawrence?

803
00:48:02,088 --> 00:48:03,965
- Door, people.
- Lawrence?

804
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:07,639
<i>The secretary tried to say,
"Don't go in there,"</i>

805
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,562
<i>but, you know, there was 40 of us.</i>

806
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:13,144
<i>Jamshed wasn't there.</i>

807
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:18,104
"We, the students of the Cooper Union
for the Advancement of Science and Art

808
00:48:18,187 --> 00:48:21,407
"can no longer uphold or endorse
the direction our college has taken

809
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:23,325
"under the leadership
of Jamshed Bharucha.

810
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:25,570
<i>"By voting no confidence today,</i>

811
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:28,327
<i>"join us in keeping
Cooper Union free to all."</i>

812
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:38,208
First let me say, I'd
rather you just leave.

813
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:41,086
"Students and others
currently engaged in

814
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:44,012
"a sit-in of the President's suite
are trespassing.

815
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:48,681
"We're going to give a one-hour period
for anyone to leave.

816
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:53,105
"Anyone remaining on
the 7th floor after that one-hour period

817
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,524
"will be subject to disciplinary action."

818
00:48:57,726 --> 00:49:02,027
<i>At some point, they are going
to have to try and remove us.</i>

819
00:49:08,237 --> 00:49:10,956
I am an officer of the Cooper Union!

820
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:28,678
- The police?
- They're coming.

821
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,308
There are security guards
on the other side of this glass,

822
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:39,109
and there's two or three other men.

823
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:03,380
Five, four, three, two, one.

824
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:06,929
Free Cooper Union!

825
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:08,639
<i>For many of us
it was the first time</i>

826
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:10,762
<i>being in the President's office.</i>

827
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:15,347
We have this red light that we'd show
to say that we're occupying the space.

828
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:19,141
<i>It's like being in a submarine.</i>

829
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:20,522
<i>It's like a shared experience,</i>

830
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:24,196
<i>and it's hard to sleep
because there's all this energy.</i>

831
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:31,370
<i>There is some physicality
of having to be there,</i>

832
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:33,539
<i>actually having to abstain
from your normal life,</i>

833
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:35,833
<i>and that's very powerful.</i>

834
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:40,458
<i>This space of the action
is also this great opportunity</i>

835
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:43,132
<i>to have no one
imposing structures on us.</i>

836
00:50:43,207 --> 00:50:46,882
And this is really
not asking permission and unapologetic,

837
00:50:46,961 --> 00:50:48,929
because we're not sorry.

838
00:51:09,525 --> 00:51:12,495
An entire school
does not have any confidence

839
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:14,823
in your ability to lead The Cooper Union.

840
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:17,909
If people have no confidence,
it means that no,

841
00:51:17,992 --> 00:51:20,996
you're not going to be able
to regain that trust,

842
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:23,464
because there's none left.

843
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:25,792
You know,
it's a little simplistic to say that,

844
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:28,593
"You don't do this, and you don't do that."

845
00:51:28,669 --> 00:51:32,765
I'm on the board.
I was firmly for no tuition.

846
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:35,346
The numbers are what they are.

847
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:38,100
However they got there,
that's where they are now.

848
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:39,304
No!

849
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:42,066
Can I finish?

850
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:44,442
You need to go. You're so rude.

851
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:45,986
I would like
the tone of this whole

852
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:47,608
discussion to cool down a little bit.

853
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:49,611
It's pretty clear, I think, to all of us

854
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:53,820
that this moment is different
than anything that's come before.

855
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:56,280
We haven't been to this point. All right?

856
00:51:56,363 --> 00:52:00,459
And I think we need to let go
of some of the old dialogue,

857
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:03,538
because we're in a new place right now.

858
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:09,503
What we need to do, quite simply,
is realize this moment in the country,

859
00:52:09,585 --> 00:52:11,804
with a trillion dollars in student debt,

860
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:16,726
with all the models of higher education
<i>as</i> a business, it's failing.

861
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:18,894
This is a moment for this school

862
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:22,519
to be the vision
of what education can be in this country,

863
00:52:22,598 --> 00:52:25,818
just <i>as</i> it was the vision 150 years ago.

864
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:28,772
It was part of a radical capitalist vision.

865
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:33,280
It is rooted in a turn-of-the-century idea
about humanity, and it's an idea

866
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:37,413
that I think is incredibly contemporary
and incredibly urgent. All right?

867
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:39,832
To effectively lead us,

868
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:44,162
you need to realize the moment
you're in and the position you're in.

869
00:52:45,037 --> 00:52:48,291
It is a historic position,
it is a historic moment.

870
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:52,720
This is a big step
that you came here to meet with us,

871
00:52:52,795 --> 00:52:56,095
but we need a leap, not a gamble.

872
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:17,494
<i>Universities are clearly
at a crisis point.</i>

873
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:19,947
<i>We've had runaway cost inflation.</i>

874
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:24,377
<i>This is not what either the kids
or the parents signed up for.</i>

875
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:27,545
<i>For yea rs,
we've been saying college</i>

876
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:30,124
<i>is a great investment no matter what.</i>

877
00:53:30,499 --> 00:53:33,469
<i>And now people are starting to
ask really, really tough questions</i>

878
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:37,174
<i>about the role that colleges play
in American society,</i>

879
00:53:37,256 --> 00:53:39,975
<i>the authority that they have,
their moral high ground.</i>

880
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:43,979
<i>Moody's is saying that
college might not be worth the cost.</i>

881
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:47,399
<i>The rating agency says the high cost
of college plus growing public doubts</i>

882
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:52,105
<i>about the value of a bachelor's degree
has caused it to revise down its outlook</i>

883
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:55,407
<i>on the entire higher education sector
to negative.</i>

884
00:53:56,692 --> 00:53:57,932
There's going to be a collapse.

885
00:53:57,943 --> 00:54:00,196
One way or another,
there's going to be a crisis.

886
00:54:00,279 --> 00:54:04,125
It gets to the point
where the price of a degree is so high

887
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:06,497
that people just don't want
to pay for it anymore.

888
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:09,792
<i>This is not
what most colleges want to talk about.</i>

889
00:54:09,872 --> 00:54:10,919
<i>They want to pretend</i>

890
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:13,592
<i>the education is something
that's completely non-financial.</i>

891
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,089
<i>It's an end in itself.</i>

892
00:54:15,294 --> 00:54:18,639
<i>These are very noble ideals,
but they don't make sense</i>

893
00:54:18,714 --> 00:54:22,184
<i>when people are taking on
$100-200,000 in student debt.</i>

894
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:32,103
<i>I don't think you'll find a more
fervent believer in the liberal arts</i>

895
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:34,939
<i>than the guy holding the
microphone in front of you today.</i>

896
00:54:35,189 --> 00:54:40,912
<i>When you start college, that's the time
to discover what you love to do.</i>

897
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:47,244
<i>It might be theater and biology.
It might be neuroscience and religion.</i>

898
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:49,829
<i>Whatever it is, now's the time</i>

899
00:54:49,912 --> 00:54:51,960
<i>when you have
the chance to experiment,</i>

900
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:54,212
<i>when you have the chance
to open yourself up to new things,</i>

901
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:57,135
<i>when you can discover who you
are and who you might become.</i>

902
00:54:57,211 --> 00:54:58,303
<i>Yes, sir?</i>

903
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:00,801
What you just said is
terrifically exciting.

904
00:55:00,881 --> 00:55:03,509
Reminds me of going back
to when I went to school.

905
00:55:03,592 --> 00:55:05,344
But the truth is

906
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:08,977
many of us in this room are about to
lay out a whole lot of money to you.

907
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:10,603
- Tell me one thing.
- Yes.

908
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:12,400
Is my daughter going to have a job

909
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:14,596
and she's not going to come back
home after it's done?

910
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:20,318
<i>"Is your daughter gonna have a
job and not come back home?"</i>

911
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,947
<i>Uh, I can't tell you that,</i>

912
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:26,533
<i>although the time to be defensive
about education is not now.</i>

913
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:31,002
<i>This is the time to be aggressive
about a broadly-based,</i>

914
00:55:31,078 --> 00:55:35,675
<i>intensely-personal and
intensively-practical form of education,</i>

915
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:37,672
<i>whatever school you go to.</i>

916
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:39,094
<i>And it is expensive.</i>

917
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:43,007
<i>I know.
I don't have to tell you parents here.</i>

918
00:55:50,848 --> 00:55:53,317
<i>We're definitely ensconced in this view</i>

919
00:55:53,392 --> 00:55:55,815
that there's only one way
to go to college.

920
00:55:55,894 --> 00:56:00,195
And that's, you know,
the four-year private school

921
00:56:00,274 --> 00:56:03,073
where your kids live in dorms
with their friends

922
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:06,280
and have all their meals taken care of
and someone cleaning the bathroom.

923
00:56:08,574 --> 00:56:12,204
<i>I'm amply stressed
about the college search to come.</i>

924
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:15,710
If you look directly that way,

925
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:18,292
that is the new One World Trade
building that they're building.

926
00:56:18,959 --> 00:56:21,462
<i>All the parents
I know, they're like</i>

927
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:24,719
<i>their kids' college search managers.</i>

928
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:27,555
So, welcome to
the Bobst Library, everyone.

929
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:30,057
As you can see,
it's a very massive building.

930
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:32,765
Altogether there are
about nine libraries in the NYU family

931
00:56:32,848 --> 00:56:34,646
and about six million volumes as well.

932
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:37,728
<i>I want this for my kids.</i>

933
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:40,314
It's just too bad it costs $60,000 a year,

934
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:42,991
and it really does cost $60,000 a year.

935
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:47,242
And this is the main building for
student life here on the NYU campus.

936
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:49,241
We have two athletic facilities
for you to go to.

937
00:56:49,281 --> 00:56:51,579
They do have, like, pools.
There's a rock climbing wall even in one.

938
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:53,786
There's a squash court in one.
So if you're really into fitness...

939
00:56:53,869 --> 00:56:59,126
It takes a real shift
to consider something different,

940
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:03,178
<i>when our kids are on this
path towards a college degree.</i>

941
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,303
<i>Going to college
has become</i> a <i>way</i>

942
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:09,635
<i>to avoid thinking about the future.</i>

943
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:11,262
"What are you going
to do with your life?"

944
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:13,425
"I don't know.
I'm just going to get another degree."

945
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:18,269
<i>And instead of getting one credential
after another on some sort of track,</i>

946
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:20,605
<i>I think it's very important
to think hard about,</i>

947
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:23,657
"if you didn't go to college,
what would you do instead?"

948
00:57:23,732 --> 00:57:27,327
<i>Peter Thiel, the man
who founded PayPal, funded Facebook,</i>

949
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:31,703
<i>is offering 24 college students $100,000</i>

950
00:57:31,782 --> 00:57:33,983
<i>if they drop out of school
and start their own business.</i>

951
00:57:55,931 --> 00:57:57,023
<i>When you think of hacking,</i>

952
00:57:57,099 --> 00:58:00,148
<i>the first thing people think of
ls literally hacking a computer.</i>

953
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:03,814
Hacking your education
is really finding an alternative.

954
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:06,116
I might go to college, I might not.

955
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:07,738
So that's why I'm here right now.

956
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:10,492
If you wanna challenge yourself
not to go college,

957
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,163
or if you wanna challenge yourself
to go to college

958
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:13,991
and get the most out of college,

959
00:58:14,074 --> 00:58:16,793
you have to reflect
on what it is you're buying

960
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:19,246
and what it is your parents are buying.

961
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:22,508
The idea that you're going to go to
keg parties for four years sounds cool,

962
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:24,710
but when you think about
what parents pay for,

963
00:58:24,793 --> 00:58:28,013
really what they're paying for
is for you to not be left behind

964
00:58:28,088 --> 00:58:30,136
in the information economy, right?

965
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:32,013
<i>People say to me all the time,</i>

966
00:58:32,092 --> 00:58:33,890
<i>"Dale, aren't you ruining people's lives</i>

967
00:58:33,969 --> 00:58:36,392
<i>"by encouraging them
to take a risk and not go to college?"</i>

968
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:40,355
I think it's much riskier to go to college

969
00:58:40,434 --> 00:58:42,903
and take on $20,000 of debt per year

970
00:58:42,978 --> 00:58:46,528
and then have miserable job
prospects when you get out

971
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:47,698
and to have to start repaying that debt.

972
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:49,697
That seems like a really high risk to me.

973
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:53,872
When you look at higher education,
what you realize is what you're paying for

974
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:58,874
is this mythical, large bundle of things
that you're supposed to get.

975
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:01,956
So I'm here to give you a framework

976
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:05,464
to look at what types of services
you could be accessing

977
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:09,592
that could either supplement
or kind of replace going to college.

978
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:12,094
So I've unbundled college
into three parts.

979
00:59:12,424 --> 00:59:16,179
<i>The first is engaging with
content you're supposed to learn.</i>

980
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:19,140
So it could be through a lecture,
transferring content to you.

981
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:21,770
Then there's an affiliate network.

982
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:24,103
<i>Enduring relationships with people</i>

983
00:59:24,186 --> 00:59:25,278
<i>that are going to took out for you,</i>

984
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:26,696
that are going to help you
find opportunities.

985
00:59:26,772 --> 00:59:29,446
<i>And the third
is a credential of accepted value,</i>

986
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:31,777
<i>which is literally a piece of paper</i>

987
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:36,411
that certifies that you have met
some minimum level of competency.

988
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:39,835
When I went to school,
there was no way to access the services

989
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:45,508
that higher education provided easily
and freely or cheaply on the Internet.

990
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:48,131
And it turns out,
well, now you kind of can.

991
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:52,260
What do you see, you know, in a world

992
00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:53,682
in which degrees don't matter so much,

993
00:59:53,757 --> 00:59:57,102
but where people say,
"Hey, I'm a dropout, but..."

994
00:59:57,177 --> 00:59:58,770
I mean, not that you're going
to phrase it that way.

995
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:01,769
I won't necessarily say first off
that I've dropped out of school,

996
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:04,442
but they'll look at it and they'll say,
"So you have experience."

997
01:00:04,518 --> 01:00:07,567
Since I was paying for college myself,
I realized pretty early on

998
01:00:07,646 --> 01:00:09,686
it's too expensive for me
to find myself in college.

999
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:11,779
I need work experience,
I need life experience,

1000
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:14,218
I need to get out of college
and actually start my own path.

1001
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:16,409
There's, like,
4,000 schools right now.

1002
01:00:16,488 --> 01:00:17,660
In a couple of years,

1003
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:19,286
that whole number
is going to get depleted,

1004
01:00:19,366 --> 01:00:21,789
and the only colleges that are really
going to matter in the future

1005
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:24,121
are going to be
the prestigious Ivy League colleges

1006
01:00:24,204 --> 01:00:25,956
that have made a name for themselves.

1007
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:27,461
<i>My mom didn't go to college,</i>

1008
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:29,635
but my dad, he is definitely a person

1009
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:31,711
who's benefitted well from college.

1010
01:00:32,129 --> 01:00:33,756
They thought I was crazy.

1011
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,080
<i>They were like, "What is this?</i>

1012
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:36,891
<i>"A whole bunch of kids
coming to San Francisco</i>

1013
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:39,807
<i>"who all don't want to go to college?"</i>

1014
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:41,729
They thought it was more like a cult.

1015
01:00:48,687 --> 01:00:50,064
<i>A friend of mine told me,</i>

1016
01:00:50,147 --> 01:00:51,319
"There's this Education Hackerhouse,

1017
01:00:51,398 --> 01:00:52,490
"and you have to meet the people,"

1018
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:55,490
because I was also
into the future of education.

1019
01:01:02,993 --> 01:01:05,393
<i>I had no idea there was
this whole community of people</i>

1020
01:01:05,412 --> 01:01:08,336
<i>that were passionate about the future
of knowledge and learning.</i>

1021
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:12,465
<i>We've had hackers come in and sleep
on bunk beds working on their apps.</i>

1022
01:01:12,586 --> 01:01:14,839
<i>We've had meetups in the backyard.</i>

1023
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:17,970
<i>We've had a variety of startups
working out of this house.</i>

1024
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:20,552
<i>And it's a community
of people that believes that</i>

1025
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:24,310
we don't need to rely
on traditional schools or institutions.

1026
01:01:24,973 --> 01:01:26,850
<i>There's no longer
a great value proposition</i>

1027
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:28,526
<i>in paying 200K for a degree,</i>

1028
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:31,071
<i>particularly when
you're not at an Ivy League school.</i>

1029
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:36,577
I didn't want to go to college because of
the cost in terms of time and money,

1030
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:40,372
and I thought that this would be
an excellent place

1031
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:42,324
to kind of get the college equivalent,

1032
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:44,250
<i>because I get the academics</i>

1033
01:01:44,326 --> 01:01:47,546
<i>living with startup entrepreneurs
and living with tech people.</i>

1034
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:48,964
It forces me to grow up,

1035
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:51,041
because you have to
do your own dishes,

1036
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:52,091
you have to cook for yourself,

1037
01:01:52,167 --> 01:01:54,841
you have to deal with rent,
all that kind of stuff.

1038
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:56,593
In Silicon Valley,

1039
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:59,470
we don't care about
accolades or experience, even.

1040
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:00,675
We care about skills.

1041
01:02:01,051 --> 01:02:04,305
As, you know, things progress,
degrees will matter less and less.

1042
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:08,017
You shouldn't have to have 200K
or have 200K of debt

1043
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:10,943
in order to learn a lot,
be really talented,

1044
01:02:11,019 --> 01:02:13,459
and then show the world
what your skills are capable of doing.

1045
01:02:14,773 --> 01:02:16,992
<i>I dropped
out of college to start</i>

1046
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:19,069
working on Facebook full time out here.

1047
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:21,280
Um, I later talked to my mom about it,

1048
01:02:21,363 --> 01:02:24,124
and she told me that she knew that
I was going to drop out of college.

1049
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:31,415
<i>There are</i> a <i>lot of
very successful entrepreneurs,</i>

1050
01:02:31,498 --> 01:02:32,715
<i>there are multi-millionaires,</i>

1051
01:02:32,791 --> 01:02:35,419
we've had billionaires
that didn't go to college.

1052
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:39,089
In fact, I'd say today,
given the Internet

1053
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:42,301
and the ease with which
you can become self-educated,

1054
01:02:42,384 --> 01:02:44,887
there's more reasons
than ever not to have to go.

1055
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:47,974
Truthfully, that's very bad advice,

1056
01:02:48,056 --> 01:02:51,856
because those people
were all exceptions to the rule.

1057
01:02:52,352 --> 01:02:55,447
<i>They made it in spite
of a system and apparatus</i>

1058
01:02:55,522 --> 01:02:57,820
<i>that said they wouldn't.</i>

1059
01:02:58,525 --> 01:03:02,530
<i>The safest bet, by far,
is to go to college.</i>

1060
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:12,604
The Thiel Fellowship is focused on,

1061
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:14,841
um, a small subset of people

1062
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:19,262
who, I think, will do fantastic
even without a college credential.

1063
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:21,556
I think it is a much
more difficult question

1064
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:25,477
what one does for people from, uh,

1065
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:28,601
average backgrounds,
less-advantaged backgrounds.

1066
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:31,058
I don't have answers for it.

1067
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:35,732
<i>Many intellectuals are saying that</i>

1068
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:39,407
<i>it would be better
if some people don't go to college at all.</i>

1069
01:03:40,442 --> 01:03:42,661
I think that's an assault on democracy,

1070
01:03:42,736 --> 01:03:45,114
and it's an attempt
to keep people in their place

1071
01:03:45,196 --> 01:03:47,494
<i>and reinforce social inequality.</i>

1072
01:03:49,743 --> 01:03:52,212
<i>Education should foster social mobility</i>

1073
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:54,798
<i>and the possibility of equality.</i>

1074
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:58,668
You have to be crazy
to intentionally not get a college degree

1075
01:03:58,752 --> 01:03:59,924
if you have a choice today.

1076
01:04:00,045 --> 01:04:03,094
And if the college education
is really a college education

1077
01:04:03,173 --> 01:04:06,017
and not just training
in one particular little field,

1078
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:07,594
you learn how to learn.

1079
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:12,353
So that can actually open up new things
in your life long after college.

1080
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:17,854
<i>Part of our responsibility as educators</i>

1081
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:23,285
<i>is actually to help inspire students
to connect with problems in the world,</i>

1082
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:25,783
because we're leaving them
with a lot of problems,

1083
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:29,958
and I think they know that actually,
and they want to engage.

1084
01:04:49,469 --> 01:04:51,221
<i>We have three demands,</i>

1085
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:54,183
<i>that Jamshed steps down as president,</i>

1086
01:04:55,392 --> 01:04:58,020
<i>that the board and the administration</i>

1087
01:04:58,103 --> 01:05:01,357
<i>publicly affirm the mission statement,
including free tuition,</i>

1088
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:06,077
<i>and the third
is to have more democratic governance.</i>

1089
01:05:08,196 --> 01:05:09,948
Now I know this has been a difficult time

1090
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:11,749
for The Cooper Union community.

1091
01:05:11,825 --> 01:05:13,168
There is anger,

1092
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:15,712
there is disappointment
over the tuition issue.

1093
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:20,960
But the debate you're having really isn't
about whether education is free.

1094
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:25,718
It's really a debate about who can,
and who is, willing to pay for it.

1095
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:28,925
There's nothing really free in life.

1096
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:31,727
Please join me in welcoming

1097
01:05:31,803 --> 01:05:35,023
the President of The Cooper Union,
Jamshed Bharucha.

1098
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:46,943
It is with awe and humility

1099
01:05:47,026 --> 01:05:50,621
that I stand before you
to honor our students.

1100
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:55,331
To our graduating students,
congratulations.

1101
01:05:56,244 --> 01:06:00,420
You have distinguished
yourselves beyond imagination.

1102
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,822
Fellow graduates,

1103
01:06:28,902 --> 01:06:32,827
I would like you all to <i>assist</i> me, please,

1104
01:06:32,906 --> 01:06:36,035
in filling this hall with our voices.

1105
01:06:41,456 --> 01:06:42,924
Mic check.

1106
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:44,342
Mic check!

1107
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:45,669
Mic check!

1108
01:06:45,752 --> 01:06:46,844
Mic check!

1109
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,012
Hope.

1110
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:49,134
Hope!

1111
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:50,848
Hope is everything.

1112
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:52,517
Hope is everything!

1113
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:54,890
To do a dull thing with hope...

1114
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:57,063
To do a dull thing with hope...

1115
01:06:57,138 --> 01:06:58,856
will never be preferable...

1116
01:06:58,932 --> 01:07:00,354
will never be preferable...

1117
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:02,686
to doing a dangerous thing with hope.

1118
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:05,898
To doing
a dangerous thing with hope.

1119
01:07:21,788 --> 01:07:23,631
<i>There is a change coming.</i>

1120
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:25,834
<i>There has to be a change coming.</i>

1121
01:07:25,959 --> 01:07:28,212
The four-year undergraduate

1122
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:30,672
residential experience
is the gold standard.

1123
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:34,513
<i>Small classes, lots of intimate contact.</i>

1124
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:39,014
<i>How do we create as close to that ideal</i>

1125
01:07:39,097 --> 01:07:41,441
<i>as we can while reducing cost?</i>

1126
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:45,979
Technology has to be
part of that solution, a big part of it.

1127
01:07:55,446 --> 01:07:56,823
<i>Some people,</i>

1128
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:59,250
<i>including the President
of Stanford University</i>

1129
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:01,669
<i>who uses the metaphor of a tsunami,</i>

1130
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:07,422
<i>believe that MOOCs,
"Massive Open Online Courses,"</i>

1131
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,923
<i>are going to transform
American higher education,</i>

1132
01:08:10,003 --> 01:08:13,098
<i>and indeed higher education
around the world, beyond recognition</i>

1133
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:14,674
<i>and sweep away</i>

1134
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:18,762
<i>everything that we associate
with colleges like this one.</i>

1135
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:22,270
<i>The</i> MOOC <i>revolution began when</i>

1136
01:08:22,348 --> 01:08:24,771
<i>Daphne Koller,
my colleague in computer science,</i>

1137
01:08:24,851 --> 01:08:26,569
<i>had come to me a number of years ago.</i>

1138
01:08:26,644 --> 01:08:29,022
She talked about a way
of teaching differently

1139
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:31,858
<i>with online technology.</i>

1140
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:36,117
<i>Then she recruited Sebastian Thrun
to try some experiments.</i>

1141
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:38,197
Welcome to the online

1142
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:40,124
introduction to artificial intelligence.

1143
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:41,166
My name is Sebastian Thrun.

1144
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:42,994
<i>We're teaching this class at Stanford,</i>

1145
01:08:43,077 --> 01:08:44,954
<i>and now we're teaching it online
for the entire world.</i>

1146
01:08:45,038 --> 01:08:47,132
<i>We're really excited about this.</i>

1147
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:49,425
Sebastian said,
"Well, let's open this course

1148
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:50,877
"to everybody in the world."

1149
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,554
There was a bit of chaos,
I must say, um,

1150
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:55,632
but there was also some real excitement,

1151
01:08:55,715 --> 01:08:58,343
particularly when
hundreds of thousands of students, uh,

1152
01:08:58,426 --> 01:09:00,554
started initially indicating interest.

1153
01:09:00,637 --> 01:09:02,355
We had an opportunity

1154
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:05,183
to really change the access that

1155
01:09:05,266 --> 01:09:07,860
hundreds of thousands
or even millions of people had

1156
01:09:07,935 --> 01:09:10,279
to an education that they would never

1157
01:09:10,355 --> 01:09:11,982
otherwise have been able to get.

1158
01:09:12,065 --> 01:09:13,988
<i>There's a red pill and a blue pill.</i>

1159
01:09:15,526 --> 01:09:18,200
<i>And you can take the blue pill</i>

1160
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:21,783
<i>and go back to your classroom
and lecture your 20 students.</i>

1161
01:09:21,866 --> 01:09:23,584
<i>But We taken the red pill,</i>

1162
01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:25,495
<i>and I've seen Wonderland.</i>

1163
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:29,834
<i>Having done this,
I can't teach at Stanford again.</i>

1164
01:09:29,916 --> 01:09:32,795
These professors who took part
in the first round of MOOCs

1165
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:34,550
<i>left Stanford to start their own</i>

1166
01:09:34,629 --> 01:09:37,348
<i>venture capital-funded startups.</i>

1167
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:40,518
Their rival on the East Coast is edX,
which is coming out of MIT and Harvard.

1168
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:44,142
<i>CS50x,
one of Harvard's first courses</i>

1169
01:09:44,222 --> 01:09:45,974
<i>involved in the edX initiative</i>

1170
01:09:46,057 --> 01:09:48,606
<i>debuted this past Monday.</i>

1171
01:09:48,685 --> 01:09:52,360
<i>Turns out we had a few more, uh,
students show up on Monday</i>

1172
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:53,985
<i>than we initially expected.</i>

1173
01:09:54,065 --> 01:09:57,865
<i>CS50x has 100,000 people
following along at home.</i>

1174
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:02,911
<i>All of these
platforms are using short videos,</i>

1175
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:05,789
<i>interactive questions,
and online chat sessions,</i>

1176
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:08,747
<i>even robe-grading, to translate courses</i>

1177
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:10,958
<i>that were created
at the world's top universities</i>

1178
01:10:11,666 --> 01:10:14,795
<i>into versions that can
and are being taken by millions of people</i>

1179
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:17,923
<i>all around the globe absolutely for free.</i>

1180
01:10:21,634 --> 01:10:24,103
<i>One of the reasons we're
experimenting with online education</i>

1181
01:10:24,178 --> 01:10:27,352
<i>is to see if the technology
can actually increase access</i>

1182
01:10:27,432 --> 01:10:28,934
<i>to high-quality education.</i>

1183
01:10:29,809 --> 01:10:31,607
<i>I don't know what people wilt learn.</i>

1184
01:10:31,686 --> 01:10:33,563
<i>That's the most important question.</i>

1185
01:10:35,398 --> 01:10:38,447
For me, this is an interactive
medium that empowers the students,

1186
01:10:38,526 --> 01:10:39,869
just very much like a video game.

1187
01:10:41,154 --> 01:10:42,531
<i>So we ask the question,</i>

1188
01:10:42,613 --> 01:10:44,240
<i>"ls there a different way to teach</i>

1189
01:10:44,323 --> 01:10:46,075
<i>"that enables students to find out</i>

1190
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:47,877
<i>"by themselves how to solve problems?"</i>

1191
01:10:48,161 --> 01:10:51,085
<i>Let me come
back to one piece of this code</i>

1192
01:10:51,164 --> 01:10:54,168
<i>that needs a little more explanation,
and that's this kernel call.</i>

1193
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:56,085
<i>Here's the name of
the kernel call square.</i>

1194
01:10:56,169 --> 01:10:58,137
<i>The way that I'm teaching
is very different</i>

1195
01:10:58,212 --> 01:10:59,573
when I'm doing it under the camera

1196
01:10:59,589 --> 01:11:01,887
As opposed to in the classroom.

1197
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:03,885
<i>Most of what they see is hands,</i>

1198
01:11:03,968 --> 01:11:06,312
<i>and hands evidently
humanize it for the students</i>

1199
01:11:06,387 --> 01:11:08,856
<i>more than if they were
just looking at Whiteboards.</i>

1200
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:11,351
<i>But that is literally
all they're going to see.</i>

1201
01:11:11,434 --> 01:11:13,402
So as far as they know, I'm a robot.

1202
01:11:14,187 --> 01:11:15,689
<i>We're certainly, um...</i>

1203
01:11:15,772 --> 01:11:17,274
I guess we are controversial,

1204
01:11:17,607 --> 01:11:20,030
<i>because we take the focus
away from the professor</i>

1205
01:11:20,151 --> 01:11:22,404
<i>and put the focus back on the student.</i>

1206
01:11:25,031 --> 01:11:27,250
<i>Does it really
make sense to have 500 professors</i>

1207
01:11:27,325 --> 01:11:29,123
<i>in 500 different universities</i>

1208
01:11:29,243 --> 01:11:31,371
<i>each teach students
in a very similar way,</i>

1209
01:11:31,454 --> 01:11:33,627
or do you take
the rock star and put him here,

1210
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:36,209
and you let him spend
10 times as much time? You know,

1211
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:39,296
maybe that rock star could do
a little bit better job for these students.

1212
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:42,385
Argh! I blew it on the last sentence.

1213
01:11:42,465 --> 01:11:44,809
<i>Okay, try that again. For instance...</i>

1214
01:11:44,884 --> 01:11:48,980
The students
united will never be divided!

1215
01:11:49,055 --> 01:11:52,980
What is happening to higher
education is not good for America,

1216
01:11:53,059 --> 01:11:55,903
and it's not good for the young people.

1217
01:11:57,313 --> 01:12:00,817
<i>This huge cost structure
that is part of the marketization</i>

1218
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:02,743
<i>of so many things in our society,</i>

1219
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:05,739
where does it get out of hand?
I think it's getting out of hand right now.

1220
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:14,588
I don't want to see tuition go up,

1221
01:12:14,664 --> 01:12:18,168
<i>but I don't know that I can convince
my colleagues here at the state capitol</i>

1222
01:12:18,251 --> 01:12:19,628
<i>to provide more money.</i>

1223
01:12:20,419 --> 01:12:24,424
So we have to look at ways
of changing the design.

1224
01:12:24,549 --> 01:12:26,847
In 2012,
I get this email message saying,

1225
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:29,554
"Hey, my name is Governor Brown.
We should talk."

1226
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:32,523
<i>I</i> was reading
the New York Times on Sunday,

1227
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:35,442
<i>and I saw his name, found his email.
I emailed him.</i>

1228
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:37,608
He called me back very soon thereafter.

1229
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:38,939
We spent about an hour on the phone,

1230
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:40,193
and Governor Brown explained to me,

1231
01:12:40,273 --> 01:12:41,991
<i>"Look, you've been focused on</i>

1232
01:12:42,066 --> 01:12:46,446
"bringing this extremely high-end
Stanford-level education to the world.

1233
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:49,533
"But realize, the disaster
in California is not that.

1234
01:12:49,615 --> 01:12:53,745
"It's really the lower level
where lots of kids are left behind."

1235
01:12:55,955 --> 01:12:58,378
From the beginning,
California's been a place of

1236
01:12:58,457 --> 01:13:02,303
pioneers and scoundrels
and bold people.

1237
01:13:03,170 --> 01:13:07,801
The California State University
System is a part of that lineage.

1238
01:13:08,676 --> 01:13:11,054
<i>California pioneered the best</i>

1239
01:13:11,137 --> 01:13:14,186
<i>public education system in the world.</i>

1240
01:13:15,725 --> 01:13:18,649
<i>They saw higher
education as the ticket</i>

1241
01:13:18,728 --> 01:13:20,526
to a better life for people in California

1242
01:13:20,605 --> 01:13:21,857
and to a better economy.

1243
01:13:21,939 --> 01:13:23,065
And when you think about

1244
01:13:23,149 --> 01:13:25,572
what California has contributed
to the American economy,

1245
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:27,403
you can trace so much of it back

1246
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:29,409
<i>To its higher education system.</i>

1247
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:32,492
<i>It was</i> a <i>tiered system
with the community colleges,</i>

1248
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:34,911
<i>the state colleges,</i>

1249
01:13:34,994 --> 01:13:37,338
<i>and the great research universities.</i>

1250
01:13:38,164 --> 01:13:41,293
<i>A system that virtually
guaranteed college education</i>

1251
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:45,255
<i>to every high school graduate
in the state of California.</i>

1252
01:13:45,338 --> 01:13:50,014
<i>The vision of Clark Kerr
would provide instruction at all levels,</i>

1253
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:53,517
<i>and students could move
upward through it.</i>

1254
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:56,599
California prospers in large part

1255
01:13:56,891 --> 01:14:01,067
to the extent that it provides ready
opportunity for all of its citizens

1256
01:14:01,145 --> 01:14:05,150
to secure education appropriate
to their interests and abilities.

1257
01:14:05,232 --> 01:14:09,328
<i>The California system is still
a model for the rest of the nation.</i>

1258
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:12,448
The problem now is that
as the state has pulled back

1259
01:14:12,531 --> 01:14:14,750
on its financial commitment
to those systems,

1260
01:14:14,825 --> 01:14:17,749
the ideal there is really under threat.

1261
01:14:24,502 --> 01:14:29,975
Only 16% of the students
at Cal State get out in four years,

1262
01:14:30,049 --> 01:14:32,973
and the longer you stay,
the more you spend.

1263
01:14:33,052 --> 01:14:34,850
So this is a big huge problem

1264
01:14:34,929 --> 01:14:38,229
with student debt
approaching a trillion dollars.

1265
01:14:42,019 --> 01:14:43,566
<i>Our students
are very hard-working.</i>

1266
01:14:43,646 --> 01:14:46,240
<i>Many of them
are first-generation to college,</i>

1267
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:49,910
<i>And more than 50% of our students
need to take remedial courses.</i>

1268
01:14:52,405 --> 01:14:54,499
But with the increasing budget cuts,

1269
01:14:55,074 --> 01:14:59,045
we're unable to offer
remedial math both semesters.

1270
01:14:59,912 --> 01:15:03,758
<i>My goal as the provost
was to do some pilot testing.</i>

1271
01:15:04,959 --> 01:15:10,090
<i>San Jose could be a living laboratory
of students to test MOOC material.</i>

1272
01:15:13,092 --> 01:15:14,514
<i>Today San Jose State will sign</i>

1273
01:15:14,593 --> 01:15:17,312
<i>a partnership agreement with Udacity.</i>

1274
01:15:17,388 --> 01:15:22,815
<i>Our aim, to focus like a laser on
entry-level classes for college credit.</i>

1275
01:15:22,893 --> 01:15:25,112
<i>That's the key, it's for college credit.</i>

1276
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,657
<i>My colleagues were shocked</i>

1277
01:15:32,737 --> 01:15:34,205
<i>San Jose State wanted to be involved</i>

1278
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:36,908
<i>at all in anything at all like Udacity.</i>

1279
01:15:36,991 --> 01:15:38,538
We're licensing our education to

1280
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:41,211
a for-profit outside vendor
that's a startup.

1281
01:15:41,287 --> 01:15:45,884
I wouldn't hire a startup do a
bathroom remodel in my house.

1282
01:15:46,125 --> 01:15:47,968
<i>What's happening in California</i>

1283
01:15:48,044 --> 01:15:49,842
<i>is crisis management tactics.</i>

1284
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,422
<i>Public funding is drying up,</i>

1285
01:15:51,505 --> 01:15:54,634
so they need to offer
more courses for less money,

1286
01:15:55,051 --> 01:15:59,557
<i>and putting a class on the Internet
seems like the easiest way.</i>

1287
01:15:59,638 --> 01:16:01,811
<i>But whether or not
it's the best way and whether or not</i>

1288
01:16:01,891 --> 01:16:04,451
<i>people who are standing to profit
should be making this decision,</i>

1289
01:16:05,519 --> 01:16:07,863
<i>I haven't heard
much honest conversation about that.</i>

1290
01:16:07,938 --> 01:16:11,613
We're giving taxpayer money
to private business.

1291
01:16:12,026 --> 01:16:13,826
We're ready for the first question.

1292
01:16:18,741 --> 01:16:22,086
We haven't...
We can't disclose the amount. I'm sorry.

1293
01:16:22,161 --> 01:16:24,459
I mean, if we're going to spend money,
why give it to Udacity?

1294
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:26,632
Why not just hire people
to teach the classes?

1295
01:16:26,707 --> 01:16:28,960
<i>The idea of a public college</i>

1296
01:16:29,043 --> 01:16:31,011
<i>that is publicly-funded and is accessible</i>

1297
01:16:31,087 --> 01:16:32,589
<i>is under attack.</i>

1298
01:16:32,671 --> 01:16:34,173
<i>So we're really creating hierarchies,</i>

1299
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:36,679
<i>Where the students who can afford it
work with teachers,</i>

1300
01:16:36,801 --> 01:16:38,929
<i>have one-on-one face-time with faculty,</i>

1301
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:40,513
<i>and students who can't afford it</i>

1302
01:16:40,971 --> 01:16:43,724
will go on YouTube.

1303
01:16:52,191 --> 01:16:57,413
The results, uh, for the first Udacity
courses are, I think, profound.

1304
01:16:57,488 --> 01:17:00,082
<i>The data is outrageous.</i>

1305
01:17:00,199 --> 01:17:06,002
<i>The pass rate in Elementary
Statistics from Udacity, 50.5%.</i>

1306
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:09,459
<i>College Algebra, 25.4%.</i>

1307
01:17:09,542 --> 01:17:12,295
<i>Entry Level Math, 23.8%.</i>

1308
01:17:12,378 --> 01:17:14,881
<i>I mean, that is downright scary.</i>

1309
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:17,175
What we want is a silver bullet.

1310
01:17:17,258 --> 01:17:20,728
What we want is a magic pill.

1311
01:17:20,803 --> 01:17:23,022
<i>Well, there isn't, unfortunately.</i>

1312
01:17:23,097 --> 01:17:25,316
<i>And it's certainly not Udacity.</i>

1313
01:17:25,391 --> 01:17:28,361
Oops! We blew it!
They didn't learn the material.

1314
01:17:28,435 --> 01:17:30,483
They couldn't succeed
in the next-level classes.

1315
01:17:30,563 --> 01:17:31,564
Oh, well!

1316
01:17:31,897 --> 01:17:34,821
Retention rates and pass rates
in online courses

1317
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:37,153
are lower than
in face-to-face just because

1318
01:17:37,236 --> 01:17:39,864
you can bring a horse to water
but you can't make them drink.

1319
01:17:39,947 --> 01:17:43,167
So by the same token,
students have to have

1320
01:17:43,242 --> 01:17:47,588
that, um, discipline,
motivation and persistence.

1321
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:51,338
Right. But you could
also say that you have to have a teacher

1322
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:53,169
- to bring those qualities out...
- Yes.

1323
01:17:53,252 --> 01:17:54,412
- ...and to coach them.
- Mmm.

1324
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:58,007
<i>And we did
attempt to do that with online mentors.</i>

1325
01:17:58,090 --> 01:18:00,058
<i>You'll be seeing
a lot of our hands throughout the course,</i>

1326
01:18:00,134 --> 01:18:01,852
<i>but we thought we would
show you our faces too</i>

1327
01:18:01,927 --> 01:18:03,270
<i>so you can get to know us better.</i>

1328
01:18:12,271 --> 01:18:15,400
<i>The students who
need the most attention,</i>

1329
01:18:15,482 --> 01:18:18,611
<i>who are least confident
about their abilities as learners,</i>

1330
01:18:20,029 --> 01:18:21,997
<i>there's a lot of evidence
that those students</i>

1331
01:18:22,072 --> 01:18:24,040
<i>don't learn very much from MOOCs.</i>

1332
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:28,208
So I'm not quite prepared to give up

1333
01:18:28,287 --> 01:18:30,710
on the California vision of Clark Kerr

1334
01:18:30,789 --> 01:18:34,043
and turn it over
to the Silicon Valley and say,

1335
01:18:34,126 --> 01:18:36,720
<i>"Onward and upward
and rescue us from this morass."</i>

1336
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:00,994
I have so much work to do.

1337
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:02,743
CS50 this week is stupid.

1338
01:19:02,821 --> 01:19:04,289
What is it?

1339
01:19:04,365 --> 01:19:06,743
You ever heard of E-Trade? It's that.

1340
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,412
Oh, that stock thing?

1341
01:19:09,495 --> 01:19:10,963
We have to build it. E-Trade.

1342
01:19:11,330 --> 01:19:14,209
<i>I'm sitting there like,
"All right, this is just too much."</i>

1343
01:19:14,291 --> 01:19:16,635
<i>I started to wonder,
"Am I going to be able to finish?</i>

1344
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:19,008
<i>"Am I going to be able to do this?"</i>

1345
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:23,554
<i>I just have to leverage what I have</i>

1346
01:19:23,634 --> 01:19:25,432
and not be so self-conscious about

1347
01:19:25,511 --> 01:19:27,229
the things that I'm not good at,

1348
01:19:27,304 --> 01:19:30,399
<i>because you already have,
you know, 10 people in your class</i>

1349
01:19:30,474 --> 01:19:32,874
that you can connect with
and work with and collaborate with.

1350
01:19:36,188 --> 01:19:37,531
I mean, look at <i>this.</i>

1351
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:40,405
This is a computer science class

1352
01:19:40,484 --> 01:19:43,283
that could be entirely taught online,
and is, to a large extent,

1353
01:19:43,362 --> 01:19:46,616
but still look at how many people
are in this dining hall who need help.

1354
01:19:46,699 --> 01:19:48,701
They need help in person.
That's why they're here.

1355
01:19:50,494 --> 01:19:51,494
Mmm-hmm.

1356
01:19:51,537 --> 01:19:53,665
Um, could you walk me through that?
I don't know what that means.

1357
01:19:53,747 --> 01:19:56,296
Okay, so when you see square brackets,

1358
01:19:56,375 --> 01:19:58,628
that usually means an array.

1359
01:19:58,711 --> 01:20:00,805
Oh, like how after that
I have "comma session lD"

1360
01:20:00,879 --> 01:20:02,847
there should be more commas?

1361
01:20:02,923 --> 01:20:05,642
So by doing this,

1362
01:20:05,718 --> 01:20:07,186
this wards off one of those attacks

1363
01:20:07,261 --> 01:20:08,638
we started talking about briefly,

1364
01:20:08,721 --> 01:20:10,519
a SQL injection attack.

1365
01:20:10,597 --> 01:20:13,316
Students require
constant engagement on my part,

1366
01:20:13,392 --> 01:20:14,814
on the teaching staff's part.

1367
01:20:14,893 --> 01:20:16,895
Most of us are up
at all hours of the night.

1368
01:20:16,979 --> 01:20:19,573
We have pretty much 24/7 coverage.

1369
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:21,400
Students can ask questions
almost any hour

1370
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:22,826
and get answers within minutes.

1371
01:20:22,901 --> 01:20:25,154
So you're on the right track,
and I'm really just proposing that

1372
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:26,329
you comment this out temporarily,

1373
01:20:26,405 --> 01:20:28,328
just to at least get
the whole thing working,

1374
01:20:28,407 --> 01:20:30,727
and then you can
plug in the additional data that you need.

1375
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:33,166
You can't, at least right now,

1376
01:20:33,245 --> 01:20:34,588
just replace a teacher
with an automaton,

1377
01:20:34,705 --> 01:20:37,299
with some kind of robot
or talking head on a screen.

1378
01:20:37,374 --> 01:20:39,672
Nothing beats person-to-person contact.

1379
01:20:39,918 --> 01:20:41,511
- See, there you go. That was the issue.
- Oh.

1380
01:20:41,587 --> 01:20:44,010
<i>The human experience
has a magic about it,</i>

1381
01:20:44,089 --> 01:20:47,684
and this is not replicable.

1382
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:50,388
We're not going
to replace that kind of learning,

1383
01:20:50,471 --> 01:20:54,021
students working together on projects
that involve being there physically.

1384
01:20:54,099 --> 01:20:56,602
<i>So how do we put
these things together,</i>

1385
01:20:56,685 --> 01:21:00,735
<i>the face-to-face
and the opportunities of the online,</i>

1386
01:21:00,814 --> 01:21:03,533
<i>and how can we come up
with hybrid models?</i>

1387
01:21:11,283 --> 01:21:13,877
<i>Community
colleges are the most flexible</i>

1388
01:21:13,952 --> 01:21:15,329
<i>institutions we have.</i>

1389
01:21:15,412 --> 01:21:18,791
<i>They are the most open
to alternative curriculums,</i>

1390
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:22,924
<i>because they've always
had to scramble to educate</i>

1391
01:21:23,003 --> 01:21:25,506
<i>the less-advantaged kids in America.</i>

1392
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:28,058
What we need to accomplish today

1393
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:30,886
is to take a look
at these lectures from edX.

1394
01:21:30,969 --> 01:21:33,188
And so if you
have any questions or problems,

1395
01:21:33,263 --> 01:21:35,641
today is the day to kind of address those.

1396
01:21:36,433 --> 01:21:39,937
<i>The model here is
to teach flipped classroom.</i>

1397
01:21:41,188 --> 01:21:44,943
And what that means
is to have the lecture content

1398
01:21:45,025 --> 01:21:47,448
be outside of the class.

1399
01:21:47,653 --> 01:21:52,875
<i>Students have an
MIT professor doing video lectures,</i>

1400
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:54,827
<i>and they watch that at home.</i>

1401
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:57,754
<i>When they've completed a lecture,
they come in here,</i>

1402
01:21:57,830 --> 01:22:00,754
<i>they work in small groups,
they talk to each other,</i>

1403
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:03,586
<i>they're encouraged to help each other,
using more hands-on,</i>

1404
01:22:03,669 --> 01:22:07,924
<i>using lots more problem solving skills
and critical thinking.</i>

1405
01:22:08,006 --> 01:22:13,729
The character function will call up
any character that has an ASCII value.

1406
01:22:13,804 --> 01:22:17,525
I guess my method to do that
was maybe a little bit different.

1407
01:22:17,599 --> 01:22:21,069
By doing flipped classroom,
eliminating the large lecture,

1408
01:22:21,145 --> 01:22:22,738
there's an opportunity

1409
01:22:22,813 --> 01:22:24,815
for the faculty member
now to spend their time

1410
01:22:24,898 --> 01:22:26,866
helping those students
who are struggling.

1411
01:22:27,526 --> 01:22:29,870
Are you testing it now,
making sure it's working?

1412
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:31,322
Okay, good.

1413
01:22:31,405 --> 01:22:32,702
How are we doing over here?

1414
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:35,204
<i>We have to do something
to keep students engaged,</i>

1415
01:22:35,284 --> 01:22:39,255
for them to learn. This is our job.
This is what we're here for.

1416
01:22:39,329 --> 01:22:41,502
<i>We're in an experimental mode.</i>

1417
01:22:41,582 --> 01:22:44,381
We have no choice but to go very fast.

1418
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:47,680
Experimentation
will produce success and failure,

1419
01:22:47,754 --> 01:22:49,315
<i>and we need to learn to live with that,</i>

1420
01:22:49,381 --> 01:22:54,262
<i>because technology is the hope for
many young people who otherwise</i>

1421
01:22:54,344 --> 01:22:56,938
<i>won't be able to afford
the education they need.</i>

1422
01:23:00,559 --> 01:23:03,233
<i>I think there's
a tendency to romanticize</i>

1423
01:23:03,312 --> 01:23:05,906
<i>the top-tier Ivy League schools.</i>

1424
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:08,359
I think what is more
important is to have the...

1425
01:23:09,568 --> 01:23:14,540
The personal will to follow through
on one's ideas and to spend

1426
01:23:14,615 --> 01:23:17,459
their time to actually be impassioned
about the things that they're working on.

1427
01:23:17,534 --> 01:23:20,663
I feel that that is a much more important,

1428
01:23:20,746 --> 01:23:23,841
um, dialogue to have with yourself.

1429
01:23:28,545 --> 01:23:32,641
This is where
I spent a decent amount of my life.

1430
01:23:32,716 --> 01:23:35,344
It was like one of the toughest
neighborhoods in Cleveland.

1431
01:23:37,262 --> 01:23:39,356
It's been tough this semester.

1432
01:23:39,431 --> 01:23:41,809
I'm not doing particularly well

1433
01:23:41,892 --> 01:23:45,897
in any of my classes,
and I start to question,

1434
01:23:45,979 --> 01:23:48,778
"Maybe I'm not cut out to be here."

1435
01:23:48,857 --> 01:23:50,700
And I just have
to slap myself back to reality, like,

1436
01:23:50,776 --> 01:23:53,029
"Wait, dawg, you're doing

1437
01:23:53,111 --> 01:23:56,615
"everything in your power to do well."

1438
01:23:56,698 --> 01:23:59,372
And, like, if I dropped out of Harvard,
I'm back where I started.

1439
01:23:59,451 --> 01:24:04,582
I haven't actually bettered myself at all.
I want to better myself.

1440
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:08,719
I look at you <i>as</i> a young man, and I say,

1441
01:24:08,794 --> 01:24:10,296
"You know, he could
have been a drug addict.

1442
01:24:10,379 --> 01:24:11,676
"He could have ran the streets.

1443
01:24:11,755 --> 01:24:12,881
"He could have been a hoodlum."

1444
01:24:12,965 --> 01:24:14,933
But you wanted to
make something out of life,

1445
01:24:15,008 --> 01:24:17,010
- and that's what I'm so proud of.
- Mmm-hmm.

1446
01:24:17,094 --> 01:24:18,596
They're gonna look at you and say,

1447
01:24:18,679 --> 01:24:20,306
"He's from Ohio, he's from Cleveland,

1448
01:24:20,389 --> 01:24:23,142
"and he was in college
trying to make something out of himself."

1449
01:24:23,225 --> 01:24:25,569
But you've got a lot of people
out there try to discourage you.

1450
01:24:25,644 --> 01:24:27,191
But you can't let that happen.

1451
01:24:27,271 --> 01:24:28,614
It's a shame that, like,

1452
01:24:28,689 --> 01:24:31,112
kids don't realize that,
so they can position theyselves

1453
01:24:31,233 --> 01:24:33,156
to take advantage
of all these opportunities,

1454
01:24:33,235 --> 01:24:35,158
because, I mean, there's just so much.

1455
01:24:35,487 --> 01:24:36,864
All right, I'll see you later.

1456
01:24:36,947 --> 01:24:39,291
- Okay, hon, we love you, hon.
- Love you, too.

1457
01:24:39,449 --> 01:24:42,498
<i>As a kid, you had
all these wild fantasies</i>

1458
01:24:42,578 --> 01:24:45,673
<i>and dreams about what you wanted to
do when you got older.</i>

1459
01:24:46,707 --> 01:24:48,584
<i>But what people consider a normal fife</i>

1460
01:24:48,667 --> 01:24:50,510
<i>where I come from is to leave school</i>

1461
01:24:50,586 --> 01:24:52,839
<i>and go get a job in a factory.</i>

1462
01:24:54,256 --> 01:24:56,224
<i>They get caught in the cycle of poverty,</i>

1463
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:59,144
<i>caught in that ghetto, almost.</i>

1464
01:25:00,178 --> 01:25:01,896
<i>That's like the fife to you.</i>

1465
01:25:01,972 --> 01:25:03,599
<i>You don't know anything better.</i>

1466
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,403
<i>College is the place where you figure out</i>

1467
01:25:08,478 --> 01:25:09,980
that there's something better.

1468
01:25:11,857 --> 01:25:14,906
It's finally over.
I survived the challenge that is CS50!

1469
01:25:16,987 --> 01:25:20,207
Yeah, it's just I wanted to do more.
I had this big goal...

1470
01:25:21,783 --> 01:25:24,036
<i>The more campuses one visits,</i>

1471
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:28,966
<i>the more one discovers that the
diversity of America's college students</i>

1472
01:25:29,041 --> 01:25:30,793
<i>is mind-boggling.</i>

1473
01:25:34,046 --> 01:25:38,017
And everywhere <i>I</i> go, <i>I</i> meet students

1474
01:25:38,091 --> 01:25:42,267
<i>who give me hope
for the future of our country.</i>

1475
01:25:44,431 --> 01:25:46,809
<i>It has been and will
continue to be a challenge</i>

1476
01:25:46,892 --> 01:25:49,111
<i>to keep the doors of college open</i>

1477
01:25:49,186 --> 01:25:53,817
<i>to provide the best possible education
to as many people as possible.</i>

1478
01:25:53,899 --> 01:25:56,277
<i>Not everybody's going to want it.</i>

1479
01:25:56,360 --> 01:26:01,491
<i>Not everybody will be able to take
good advantage of more education.</i>

1480
01:26:02,032 --> 01:26:06,128
<i>But let's not assume
that college has outlived its usefulness.</i>

1481
01:26:06,244 --> 01:26:08,087
<i>Let's not assume that it's inevitable</i>

1482
01:26:08,163 --> 01:26:09,961
that public support for institutions

1483
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:12,759
of higher learning
has to just continue to decline.

1484
01:26:14,628 --> 01:26:17,552
<i>There are other choices
that can be made.</i>

1485
01:26:17,631 --> 01:26:19,929
I mean, what kind
of a society do we want to be?

1486
01:26:22,386 --> 01:26:25,390
<i>We should tap into
the idealism of young people</i>

1487
01:26:25,472 --> 01:26:27,691
<i>and provoke students
to think for themselves,</i>

1488
01:26:27,766 --> 01:26:31,612
<i>to think critically
about the way society is put together.</i>

1489
01:26:33,355 --> 01:26:36,108
America has been
all about critical thinking.

1490
01:26:37,442 --> 01:26:39,194
<i>That's how we became America.</i>

1491
01:26:41,238 --> 01:26:43,036
I support the occupation!

1492
01:26:43,115 --> 01:26:44,867
I support the occupation!

1493
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:47,078
I support the mission statement!

1494
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:49,208
I support
the mission statement!

1495
01:26:49,287 --> 01:26:52,131
And I support the notion of free

1496
01:26:52,207 --> 01:26:55,211
and accessible education for all!

1497
01:27:14,938 --> 01:27:17,407
<i>This was one of the longest
student occupations</i>

1498
01:27:17,482 --> 01:27:19,905
<i>in American history.</i>

1499
01:27:22,154 --> 01:27:25,078
<i>Everyone I know has given
so much of their time</i>

1500
01:27:25,157 --> 01:27:27,660
<i>and their energies
trying to save our school.</i>

1501
01:27:28,702 --> 01:27:32,002
<i>It is very tiring,
and it feels very much uphill.</i>

1502
01:27:32,122 --> 01:27:35,342
<i>There's so much other work
that needs to be done.</i>

1503
01:27:43,633 --> 01:27:45,306
In favor.

1504
01:27:47,304 --> 01:27:49,932
<i>It's really tragic
that the only resolution</i>

1505
01:27:50,015 --> 01:27:53,144
<i>they could think of is to charge tuition,</i>

1506
01:27:53,226 --> 01:27:56,571
but I think the tuition announcement
was not the end of an era.

1507
01:27:56,646 --> 01:27:59,399
It was actually
the beginning of a campaign.

1508
01:28:02,986 --> 01:28:06,206
<i>It might take a tong time to see
the world that we want to live in.</i>

1509
01:28:08,909 --> 01:28:12,379
But anytime someone says,
"You can't do that,"

1510
01:28:12,454 --> 01:28:14,582
a little trigger goes off in my head,
and I'm like,

1511
01:28:14,664 --> 01:28:16,007
"But you can."
