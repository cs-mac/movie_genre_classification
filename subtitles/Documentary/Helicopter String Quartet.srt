If you insist on tackling
the 131 prematurely,

164
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:30,836
at least read
his biography first. Right?

165
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,143
Try to get into his mind.

166
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:38,149
Did you know his father used to wake
him up in the middle of the night

167
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:40,848
to play for his drunken cronies?

- Yeah.

184

I could choreograph a piece to it.

What are you playing
on this one?

190
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:01,934
Second violin. Always, that's my part.

191
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:03,335
Always?

192
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:06,534
Yeah. Well, without me
they'd be a lonely, frustrated trio.

193
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:11,605
Seriously, the second and first violin
aren't hierarchical,

194
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:12,977
they're just different roles.

195
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,252
Different how?

196
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:21,518
Well, sometimes I get the melody,
sometimes the bass line.

197

Uh...

198
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:28,491
I connect the first violin,
which tends to be the soloist's part,

199
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,123
with the viola and cello,

200
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:36,205
which just flow...
right underneath the surface.

201
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:40,970
Simply put, I pull it all together.
That's my job.

202
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,979
Sounds important, but still...

203
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:47,380
Don't you have the urge to play
the solo part once in a while?

204
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:52,152
Yeah. Of course.

something about it?

This difficulty I've been having...

...Parkinson's, she says,

222
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,905
Yes, my brain
is running out of something.

223
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:18,304
Dopamine. It regulates movement.

224
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,966
Is it painful?

225
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,410
Not at all, and the even better
part is, there is medication.

226
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,208
It replaces this dopamine.

227
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:29,581
It's not a cure,
but it can slow the progress.

That's encouraging.

a season, could be two.

But I've made up my mind

235
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:55,701
that it's best for the quartet
to plan ahead,

236

an even split at first,

I think we could decide

00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:59,030
Because I don't believe it is his wish.

318
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,735
He's overwhelmed right now.

319
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:04,505
Imagine how devastating
this has been for him.

320
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:07,310
First Miriam and now this.

321
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,518
We have to give him time to adjust.

322
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,812
What do we do about Robert?

323
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:16,419
What about Robert?

324
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:18,926
Alternating chairs Robert?

325
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,387
You should talk to him about that.

326
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,626
I doubt me talking
to him would help.

327
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,933
It will completely alter our sound,
Jules, you understand that.

328
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:33,099
That's also true if we replace Peter
with another cellist.

Not if it's Nina, no.

330
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,106
She subbed for Peter very well
last year. She's very compatible.

331
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,452
Would you please talk to him?

332
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:50,884
Anyway, if Peter quits,
I may not continue.

333
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:57,761
All right.

you talk to Robert.

335

You know, I didn't expect to feel this,

336
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:18,718
but it turns out, I love being our age.

337
00:26:19,377 --> 00:26:23,120
I just love not having to prove
anything to anybody.

338
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:28,825
It's just great to go on stage,
sit down and play music.

339
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:32,832
You know, in Munich,
after our concert,

340
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:37,771
the audience was applauding and Nina
whispered to me, "That was fun!"

341
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:38,897
Ah.

342
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:42,102
Can you imagine Nina?
"That was fun!"

343
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:48,108
You really taught her well,
and I am very, very grateful to you.

Gideon, I need to ask
a big, serious favor.

345
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:54,614
Well, for you, anything.

346
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:00,188
I've made up my mind to stop performing,

347
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:03,822
and my choice to replace me
at the Fugue would be Nina.

348
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:08,637
- Nina? From my trio?
- Your Nina.

349
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:10,801
She's the one who can do it.

350
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:12,636
She knows our repertoire,

351
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:16,143
the quartet likes her,
personally, creatively.

352
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:19,112
We need her.

353
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:22,047
If she'll agree, of course.

354
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:27,520
Peter that would be a big mistake.

355
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,819
Don't retire!

356
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:33,293
I promise you,
you are going to get a second wind,

357
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:37,457
and it could be the nicest
part of your entire life.

358
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:43,335
I mean, and you certainly
can't ask me to give up Nina.

359
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:49,075
I mean, she's become an integral part
of the trio, I could never replace her.

360
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,807
Gideon, there's no comparing.
It's easier to replace for a piano trio.

361
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:55,918
There are cellists who could
take her place, I can help you find one.

362
00:27:57,275 --> 00:28:01,485
To my mind, the Fugue without Nina
might not survive.

363
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,191
It's that serious.

364
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:18,269
I understand what you're saying,
but I can't do that.

365
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,302
I can't give her up.

366
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:27,237
I'm going to begin
by talking about some general principles

367
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:29,548
I'm going to begin
by talking about some general principles

368
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:31,813
that involve Parkinson's.

369
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:35,322
One of them
is that everything gets smaller.

370
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:39,896
Our posture gets smaller,
our stride gets smaller,

371
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:44,296
our voice gets smaller,
even our handwriting gets small.

372
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:47,266
Everything contracts and closes in.

373
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:50,134
So we need to push those boundaries out.

374
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:54,835
We need to move big, so that
we can take control of Parkinson's,

375
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:57,310
rather than it taking
control of us.

376
00:28:57,435 --> 00:29:01,008
And to do that,
we use conscious movement.

377
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,186
So, let's just start by stretching
the arms out,

378

and bringing them down,

380
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:18,466
And we're gonna go front and side.

381

And up and down. Good job.

382

making an issue of this now?

472
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,475
I never wanted to be
a second violin.

00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:50,284

because... we were good.

for the harmony.

You know, when Peter brought
up that he might be leaving...

478

that every rehearsal was...
discovery?

forward to going there.

over a hairpin.

throats over a bow stroke.

When your mother died,
the big mistake I made

was allowing the quartet to break up.

Let me tell you what makes the Fugue
such a great quartet.

651
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:42,778
OK.

652
00:50:42,906 --> 00:50:45,819
First, they have you.

with your relentless precision.

Well...

656
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:59,399
Then... you have my father.

657
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:04,472
And he's adding color
and texture and rhythm.

658

He's always enhancing you,
he's lifting you up,

There are many quartets
with an accomplished first violin.

661
00:51:14,037 --> 00:51:15,641
It's the second violinist,

662
00:51:15,772 --> 00:51:19,310
the quality of the second violinist,
that makes a quartet stand out.

663

And your father is great.

She adds a depth of sound
that none of you could bring.

She makes you wanna weep
without exactly knowing why.

Is that the voice of a wounded soul?

The survival skills she had to develop

669
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:48,348

I think our marriage is a good one.

So I can't believe that one truly
regrettable night's gonna ruin all that.

you felt like you were forced into it.

That you wouldn't have married me
if you didn't get pregnant.

you haven't really been there.
