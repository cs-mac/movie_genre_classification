While top representatives from each country...

were convening at the UN to discuss global peace-keeping and security,

the self-appointed G's from around the world...

are convening for the peace-keeping and security of global youths,

We shall begin the session.

I'm the Chairman of Non Summit Meeting, Jun Hyun-moo.

I'm Secretary General Yoo Se-yoon.

to discuss global issues and share their diverse opinions.

(Global Side Dishes Time, What is Important?)

20
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,697
- That was fresh. - Was it okay?

21
00:00:51,697 --> 00:00:52,784
Let's go!

22
00:00:53,102 --> 00:00:54,847
This is the issue brought up by the US representative.

23
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,535
From the Friday of the fourth week of November every year,

24
00:00:57,551 --> 00:00:59,937
the massive sales event,

25
00:00:59,962 --> 00:01:01,991
Black Friday begins.

26
00:01:02,518 --> 00:01:05,639
On this day most items in the stores...

27
00:01:05,911 --> 00:01:07,654
can be purchased 80 to 90 percent cheaper.

28
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:11,591
For people who love to shop, they wait every year for this day.

29
00:01:11,615 --> 00:01:13,263
But from another angle, it has become controversial...

30
00:01:13,655 --> 00:01:17,292
because it causes people to purchase unnecessary products.

31
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,295
I would like to ask all of you for your opinions on this matter.

32
00:01:20,703 --> 00:01:22,246
So, I bring this issue to you.

33
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,503
The phrase "Black Friday" has become a word we use in Korea as well.

34
00:01:25,928 --> 00:01:27,382
How did this shopping event first start?

35
00:01:27,413 --> 00:01:30,871
In the US, when a company makes a profit,

36
00:01:31,181 --> 00:01:33,134
it is represented with a black line on the sheet.

37
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,830
If however, it the company is making a loss, it is represented by a red line.

38
00:01:35,975 --> 00:01:37,587
Let's say your company was making a loss,

39
00:01:37,616 --> 00:01:41,159
but as soon as we enter the month of November, the holiday shopping season starts...

40
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:44,494
so the company starts to go from red to black.

41
00:01:44,763 --> 00:01:47,433
- That's what it means. - Right, the company makes a profit.

42
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:50,783
From the consumer's perspective, since you are buying at a cheap price, it's good.

43
00:01:50,812 --> 00:01:52,626
Also sellers can promote their sales.

44
00:01:52,752 --> 00:01:56,618
- Because of this people purchase items they don't need. - Since it is cheap.

45
00:01:56,677 --> 00:01:58,528
It is cheap. This is becoming a controversial topic.

46
00:01:58,699 --> 00:02:00,544
We would like to ask you all for your thoughts on this.

47
00:02:01,047 --> 00:02:03,808
Does Black Friday help stimulate the economy?

48
00:02:04,027 --> 00:02:06,147
Or does it just promote excessive consumption?

49
00:02:06,331 --> 00:02:08,846
Does it help the economy? Press the button in 1, 2, 3.

50
00:02:11,411 --> 00:02:18,329
(Helps the economy 6, Excessive spending 5)

51
00:02:18,457 --> 00:02:21,989
I don't know if it helps the economy but it does certainly help me.

52
00:02:21,999 --> 00:02:25,264
- Of course. Everything is on sale. - It's because,

53
00:02:25,293 --> 00:02:26,963
let's say I was in the desert,

54
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,171
if there was a sign that said there was water to the right 1km away,

55
00:02:29,225 --> 00:02:31,681
And if there was a sign pointing the other way that said there was a sale 2km away.

56
00:02:31,707 --> 00:02:32,707
I'd head towards the sale.

57
00:02:32,733 --> 00:02:35,001
You'd rather head towards the sale than water in the desert?

58
00:02:35,001 --> 00:02:37,459
- That's excessive. - Because I'm a shopaholic.

59
00:02:37,637 --> 00:02:40,690
- I think you are too excessive. - But Indian people,

60
00:02:40,921 --> 00:02:43,220
don't like buying expensive items, we like to buy things at a low price...

61
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,482
and brag about it.

62
00:02:44,515 --> 00:02:46,199
This is just...

63
00:02:46,526 --> 00:02:49,375
- an event to create excessive spending. - That is true.

64
00:02:49,672 --> 00:02:51,772
Companies need to make sales, right?

65
00:02:52,194 --> 00:02:53,883
There are so many ways that they could create sales.

66
00:02:53,908 --> 00:02:55,394
They could have a great promotion.

67
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:59,138
They could promote values and promote their sale.

68
00:02:59,298 --> 00:03:01,339
Or they could just promote it like, "It's a sale. It's cheap."

69
00:03:01,404 --> 00:03:03,633
- But... - Hold on a moment.

70
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,582
Let's say this normally costs 200 dollars...

71
00:03:05,873 --> 00:03:09,040
- but they sell it for 80 dollars and people buy it. - That's smart not stupid.

72
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:10,851
Hold on a second. Does that make sense?

73
00:03:10,866 --> 00:03:12,963
When an item that normally costs 100 dollars and...

74
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:15,459
then they sell it for 20 dollars during the sale.

75
00:03:15,756 --> 00:03:19,233
From the perspective of the consumer, don't you feel like you've been made a fool?

76
00:03:19,289 --> 00:03:22,632
- How would the people who paid the full price feel? - Exactly.

77
00:03:22,632 --> 00:03:24,741
I feel like this event has no value.

78
00:03:24,808 --> 00:03:27,829
There are so many other ways to create more sales.

79
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,192
You could have a promotion.

80
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,968
I would like to say something. If you have a promotion,

81
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,864
then I can't buy that 1,000 dollar TV.

82
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:37,072
If that 1,000 dollar TV drops to 200 dollars, than I can buy it.

83
00:03:37,224 --> 00:03:38,799
Would I buy it? Of course I would.

84
00:03:38,824 --> 00:03:40,613
Because of that...

85
00:03:40,613 --> 00:03:42,936
- That's a unique way of talking. - Normally,

86
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:45,060
- "Would I buy it? Of course I would." - "Of course I would."

87
00:03:45,178 --> 00:03:47,912
- Normally people say they wouldn't buy it. - Right.

88
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:50,652
- I... - I'll try that way of talking some day.

89
00:03:50,672 --> 00:03:52,322
(He tricked them with the way he spoke.)

90
00:03:52,392 --> 00:03:54,177
What I would like to say is,

91
00:03:54,488 --> 00:03:57,624
this is good for people who are not able to afford the items they wanted.

92
00:03:58,049 --> 00:03:59,792
It's a chance for them to buy these products as well.

93
00:03:59,848 --> 00:04:01,680
It's a good thing for a lot of people.

94
00:04:01,734 --> 00:04:04,877
- Right. - Also, even if it is a product that they no longer make,

95
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:07,765
the sale of those products does help the economy.

96
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,125
This is a marketing technique, right?

97
00:04:10,357 --> 00:04:12,269
- It's profitable for them, that's why they do it. - Right.

98
00:04:12,614 --> 00:04:14,614
Spending does rise during this time.

99
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,429
But when the sale ends, people no longer purchase it, right?

100
00:04:18,454 --> 00:04:21,023
If that happens, it will cause a big drop in sales afterward.

101
00:04:21,522 --> 00:04:24,536
I don't know if this would be a big help for the economy.

102
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:28,183
People believe just saving money is not financially meaningful.

103
00:04:28,424 --> 00:04:30,517
Like Black Friday,

104
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,705
you have Christmas and Valentine's Day,

105
00:04:32,747 --> 00:04:34,217
you buy presents on that day, right?

106
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:38,470
The reason we do that is to help the circulation of money, right?

107
00:04:39,084 --> 00:04:41,084
- Circulation? - Circulation of money.

108
00:04:41,109 --> 00:04:44,571
- Circulation of money. - It's to help that, right?

109
00:04:44,599 --> 00:04:46,599
I mean, well...

110
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:48,674
What was his name?

111
00:04:49,638 --> 00:04:51,037
(Aurélien didn't know Christian's name.)

112
00:04:51,037 --> 00:04:52,627
- He's boiling with rage. - He looks so angry.

113
00:04:52,645 --> 00:04:56,114
- No, he did it on purpose. - No, I mean...

114
00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:58,699
- Aurélien, how could you forget? - He did that on purpose.

115
00:04:59,367 --> 00:05:02,097
- He did that on purpose. - Call him the representative for Mexico.

116
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,500
Just call him Mexico.

117
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,221
- No, don't do that. - Christian.

118
00:05:05,246 --> 00:05:09,037
In our world, our natural resources...

119
00:05:09,349 --> 00:05:11,773
are not infinite.

120
00:05:11,982 --> 00:05:14,558
We'll run out. Therefore, if people...

121
00:05:14,742 --> 00:05:16,694
keep consuming things,

122
00:05:16,827 --> 00:05:19,506
we could go over that limit.

123
00:05:19,538 --> 00:05:22,488
- Because it is cheap. - Swiss riches wouldn't mind sale events like this, right?

124
00:05:23,676 --> 00:05:24,982
"I can just purchase it anytime."

125
00:05:25,007 --> 00:05:27,992
- Well... - You can just purchase things at their original price.

126
00:05:28,017 --> 00:05:30,005
What is there to worry about?

127
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:32,977
It feels like they are promoting consumerism.

128
00:05:33,377 --> 00:05:37,205
If I want to buy something, I can just purchase it. That part is true.

129
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:41,732
I feel it is a bad habit to purchase something that you don't need.

130
00:05:41,757 --> 00:05:43,933
That's why I would like events...

131
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:46,669
like Black Friday to disappear.

132
00:05:47,236 --> 00:05:48,588
He doesn't need them.

133
00:05:48,613 --> 00:05:50,508
Do we really need a day like this?

134
00:05:50,533 --> 00:05:53,004
That is something that we agonize over a lot about.

135
00:05:53,018 --> 00:05:55,370
Because, let's say it's Thanksgiving Day on Thursday,

136
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:57,129
and Black Friday is the next day.

137
00:05:57,154 --> 00:06:00,769
Black Friday is sandwiched between the holiday and the weekend.

138
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:04,018
You should be spending that day with your family.

139
00:06:04,706 --> 00:06:08,458
But instead of doing that, you go out to do shopping.

140
00:06:08,498 --> 00:06:10,818
Because of this, the department stores can't close on that day.

141
00:06:10,834 --> 00:06:13,458
The staff has to come out and work on that day.

142
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,580
- They can make money. - They're making money.

143
00:06:16,178 --> 00:06:18,081
That depends on what you value more.

144
00:06:18,201 --> 00:06:22,945
For Mark, he believes his family is more important.

145
00:06:23,078 --> 00:06:25,511
But you just want to purchase items at a cheap price.

146
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:26,856
- Did you say you? - I mean...

147
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,712
That's what I think.

148
00:06:28,737 --> 00:06:30,181
He's a good speaker.

149
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:33,629
- He is really good at offending people. - He makes people angry.

150
00:06:34,903 --> 00:06:37,642
Since this causes people to act like this,

151
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,709
- it causes conflict. - You're right.

152
00:06:39,773 --> 00:06:43,747
Or this TV has been discounted by 80 percent but there are only 2 of them.

153
00:06:43,771 --> 00:06:48,539
So you fight with someone for the last one. Do we really need to do that?

154
00:06:48,874 --> 00:06:51,695
(Go away! That one is mine!)

155
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:56,069
(In some cases, this leads to fights...)

156
00:06:56,938 --> 00:06:59,755
(or they use weapons and cause a bigger fight.)

157
00:06:59,847 --> 00:07:01,568
(Using an electric stun gun)

158
00:07:01,911 --> 00:07:04,344
You've only seen this on TV, right? I've actually been in a fight like that.

159
00:07:04,344 --> 00:07:06,342
I fought with someone and bought products.

160
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,137
- In China... - Wang Xinlin got into a fight?

161
00:07:08,162 --> 00:07:12,795
I went shopping with my mom when they were having a big sale.

162
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:16,241
Before we went, my mom and I divided up what we needed to buy.

163
00:07:16,241 --> 00:07:19,017
- You had a plan. - Yes. We'll go in like this and by getting into fights...

164
00:07:19,017 --> 00:07:22,112
you create lovely family memories.

165
00:07:22,168 --> 00:07:23,879
(This is like memories of a war.)

166
00:07:23,904 --> 00:07:25,188
What is that?

167
00:07:26,223 --> 00:07:27,881
(Isn't it true?)

168
00:07:27,912 --> 00:07:30,241
- It's a beautiful memory. - So by fighting,

169
00:07:30,725 --> 00:07:33,524
- you are making family bonds. - You fight together.

170
00:07:33,974 --> 00:07:36,039
You're in like a war zone with your mom.

171
00:07:36,263 --> 00:07:38,543
- Do you think it would have been fun? - Of course it was.

172
00:07:39,415 --> 00:07:42,799
- Go to Jeju Island with your family. - That's awesome.

173
00:07:42,824 --> 00:07:45,177
- You could make great family memories there. - No, was it good memories?

174
00:07:45,186 --> 00:07:46,960
Yes, I was talking on the phone with my mom yesterday,

175
00:07:46,985 --> 00:07:51,043
and I asked her what she would buy this year. She said it's no fun without me.

176
00:07:51,068 --> 00:07:53,436
"We had fun having fights like that."

177
00:07:53,436 --> 00:07:55,580
- This is how you make good memories. -Yes.

178
00:07:56,149 --> 00:08:00,951
When did this happen? When did you make these memories with your mom?

179
00:08:00,983 --> 00:08:03,367
In China, we have a big sale on November 11th,

180
00:08:03,421 --> 00:08:05,821
This is Chinese Black Friday. There are four ones on that date.

181
00:08:05,846 --> 00:08:08,205
So, we call it a day for single people.

182
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:10,543
"Single people, don't stay at home."

183
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:13,913
"Console yourself by shopping at stores or online."

184
00:08:14,246 --> 00:08:16,769
- That's a weird event. - Console yourselves by shopping.

185
00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:20,320
- That's strange. - It first formally began in 2009.

186
00:08:20,597 --> 00:08:23,998
Normally products are discounted from 50 to 70 percent off.

187
00:08:24,108 --> 00:08:27,181
On November 11th this year,

188
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,394
the amount of money that was spent was close to 18 billion dollars.

189
00:08:29,445 --> 00:08:31,124
- The sales. - It was over 100 million dollars?

190
00:08:31,216 --> 00:08:32,392
- Wow. - Wow.

191
00:08:32,417 --> 00:08:36,537
If you are a second late online, then the product you want will disappear.

192
00:08:36,537 --> 00:08:39,455
- You have to click very fast. - I was in Korea last year, right?

193
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,087
The internet in Korea is very fast.

194
00:08:41,127 --> 00:08:44,065
- Did you purchase anything? - Yes. So, when I clicked on a product,

195
00:08:44,414 --> 00:08:46,348
- I wouldn't miss it. - What did you buy?

196
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,972
I bought all the tools you need to make cookies.

197
00:08:50,382 --> 00:08:52,197
They put everything on sale.

198
00:08:53,182 --> 00:08:56,766
Do you have a special day for shopping in your country?

199
00:08:56,974 --> 00:08:58,837
In France, we have a special period for sales...

200
00:08:58,862 --> 00:09:01,238
but the country decides when the sale starts.

201
00:09:01,263 --> 00:09:02,875
They decide when it ends as well.

202
00:09:03,226 --> 00:09:05,028
So for six weeks starting from January,

203
00:09:05,197 --> 00:09:08,020
and during July for six weeks, that when we have our sales.

204
00:09:08,204 --> 00:09:11,492
Boxing Day is a bigger sales day than Black Friday.

205
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,700
It's something that country's in the Commonwealth celebrates.

206
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,294
During the Middle Ages, the servants received their presents...

207
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,299
in boxes from their masters.

208
00:09:19,331 --> 00:09:21,020
That was the day after Christmas Day.

209
00:09:21,043 --> 00:09:24,622
We call it Boxing Day because they received their gifts in boxes.

210
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,655
(I see.)

211
00:09:27,503 --> 00:09:29,168
- That's why it's called Boxing Day. - Yes.

212
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,989
We have it in Canada.

213
00:09:31,097 --> 00:09:33,660
All the Commonwealth Nations celebrate that day.

214
00:09:34,714 --> 00:09:37,559
- Boxing Day. - That's why we prefer that day.

215
00:09:37,584 --> 00:09:39,704
It's a better day to go shopping.

216
00:09:39,742 --> 00:09:43,671
It has nothing to do with boxing. In India we have a celebration called Diwali.

217
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:46,093
If you purchase products made from gold or that are stainless steel...

218
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:47,659
they say you'll have good luck.

219
00:09:48,073 --> 00:09:51,981
During this period, they give out discounts for gold and stainless steel products.

220
00:09:52,517 --> 00:09:55,365
In the US we don't need Black Friday...

221
00:09:55,648 --> 00:09:57,641
because we have a sale every day.

222
00:09:57,992 --> 00:09:59,794
There is always a sale of some kind.

223
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,809
Online stores have a day called Cyber Monday.

224
00:10:01,945 --> 00:10:03,560
There is an after Christmas sale.

225
00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:06,376
We have Columbus Day sale, Martin Luther King Day Sale,

226
00:10:06,376 --> 00:10:07,772
and Mother's Day and Father's Day sale.

227
00:10:07,797 --> 00:10:09,434
We have a sale every month.

228
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,723
We don't need to have Black Friday.

229
00:10:11,739 --> 00:10:14,884
In Japan we have a new event called Premium Friday.

230
00:10:15,361 --> 00:10:18,320
It will start around the end of February next year.

231
00:10:18,521 --> 00:10:21,863
- It hasn't started yet? - No. But it's going to start soon.

232
00:10:21,928 --> 00:10:23,794
Usually we leave the office around 6pm.

233
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:26,017
But we'll be able to get off 3 hours earlier.

234
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,042
- So that we can start shopping earlier. - I see.

235
00:10:28,066 --> 00:10:30,324
That's the intention, but it's facing strong public criticism.

236
00:10:30,349 --> 00:10:33,375
Currently, people's wage and salary are not that high.

237
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:35,647
How can we spend money when we don't have enough money?

238
00:10:36,183 --> 00:10:39,178
Also, the sales clerks would have to keep working.

239
00:10:39,178 --> 00:10:42,218
So many people are against this idea, and we need to wait and see.

240
00:10:42,363 --> 00:10:44,404
During the Ramadan period, Pakistanis...

241
00:10:44,468 --> 00:10:46,870
- are on fast from morning to evening. - Right.

242
00:10:46,883 --> 00:10:49,532
We can start eating after 8pm.

243
00:10:49,532 --> 00:10:53,112
After that, food and ingredients are on massive sale.

244
00:10:53,112 --> 00:10:57,021
During the period, we can eat luxurious dishes we couldn't afford throughout the year.

245
00:10:57,148 --> 00:10:58,487
- Interesting. - Yes.

246
00:10:58,534 --> 00:11:01,551
But there are certain accidents during Black Friday periods.

247
00:11:01,566 --> 00:11:04,518
Are there issues that stirred controversies during such sale period?

248
00:11:04,542 --> 00:11:07,087
There's "Buen fin" in Mexico.

249
00:11:07,087 --> 00:11:09,087
It means "good weekend".

250
00:11:09,124 --> 00:11:12,901
The sale is held on weekend, and it falls on the same day as Black Friday.

251
00:11:12,925 --> 00:11:17,203
But it was found that before the Buen Fin period, some stores in Mexico...

252
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:20,699
intentionally raise the prices of their goods...

253
00:11:20,724 --> 00:11:23,483
by 10 to 32 percent.

254
00:11:23,499 --> 00:11:25,179
- They raise the price in advance. - Yes.

255
00:11:25,204 --> 00:11:28,571
So that they can sell the products at their original prices even during the sale.

256
00:11:28,603 --> 00:11:31,255
That's what happened. It was quite controversial.

257
00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:35,083
- The biggest issue in China is delivery service. - Delivery.

258
00:11:35,108 --> 00:11:38,963
It's expected that more than one billion parcels will be delivered this year.

259
00:11:38,988 --> 00:11:41,859
- The number of parcels exceeds one billion? - Yes.

260
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:43,075
It's one billion.

261
00:11:43,118 --> 00:11:45,183
The huge amount of parcels has been a big headache.

262
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:48,398
Last year, one of the delivery trucks had a traffic accident...

263
00:11:48,598 --> 00:11:52,527
while it was delivering the parcels and 4,000 parcels were burnt.

264
00:11:53,951 --> 00:11:56,503
One incident attracted people's attention last year in Italy.

265
00:11:56,528 --> 00:11:59,306
One store put up a banner which says "Sale You've Never Seen"...

266
00:11:59,362 --> 00:12:01,362
in front of the store. It was very big.

267
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:06,145
The problem was, they used the picture of Andrea Bocelli, who's visually impaired.

268
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:08,518
- Oh no. - It stirred a huge controversy.

269
00:12:08,518 --> 00:12:11,212
Some said the banner depreciated people with visual impairment.

270
00:12:11,212 --> 00:12:13,853
Moreover, they didn't pay Andrea Bocelli for using his picture.

271
00:12:13,857 --> 00:12:16,115
They used his picture for free.

272
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,115
What strange people.

273
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:22,819
Arguments over sale are quite common and frequent in the US.

274
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:25,683
But last year's popular products were a bit controversial.

275
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,932
- They were guns. - Guns?

276
00:12:28,195 --> 00:12:30,924
The daily gun sales...

277
00:12:30,956 --> 00:12:33,124
hit a new record.

278
00:12:33,412 --> 00:12:36,298
Some questioned "Do we really have to buy guns on Black Friday?"

279
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:37,752
That's absurd.

280
00:12:37,777 --> 00:12:39,597
- It shouldn't be allowed. - I agree.

281
00:12:39,818 --> 00:12:42,257
But we have nothing to do with Black Friday.

282
00:12:42,257 --> 00:12:43,989
It takes place in the US.

283
00:12:44,261 --> 00:12:47,334
So many non-Americans try to buy things through online cross-border shopping.

284
00:12:47,426 --> 00:12:51,537
Despite the complex purchase process, many Koreans do this because of price advantage.

285
00:12:51,569 --> 00:12:53,442
They're called cross-border shoppers.

286
00:12:53,474 --> 00:12:55,306
Many celebrities love it, too.

287
00:12:55,322 --> 00:12:58,841
- They can buy clothes and designer goods not available in Korea. - Right, we can't buy them here.

288
00:12:58,865 --> 00:13:01,050
- Or things that are cheaper. - That's good.

289
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:04,373
Will you do cross-border shopping if it's cheaper though it's cumbersome?

290
00:13:04,373 --> 00:13:07,366
Or do you want to buy things locally because you need to check it out yourself even though...

291
00:13:07,878 --> 00:13:09,518
it's more expensive that way?

292
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:11,766
Who are cross-border shopper? In 1,2,3.

293
00:13:12,982 --> 00:13:15,247
- Only four raised their hands. - It's no wonder.

294
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,662
We're living in the era of smartphones and world wide Internet.

295
00:13:18,678 --> 00:13:21,918
It's ridiculous there are still people who don't try cross-border shopping.

296
00:13:21,943 --> 00:13:23,774
But if you buy things based on their pictures only,

297
00:13:24,021 --> 00:13:25,533
- you might be cheated. - Listen.

298
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,978
- True. - Hold on.

299
00:13:26,978 --> 00:13:28,374
Why would I be cheated?

300
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,115
It could be because of my personality.

301
00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:32,980
I feel it's safer only when I see and touch it myself.

302
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,100
It's a personality problem.

303
00:13:34,124 --> 00:13:36,128
- No, it's not a problem. - No, it's not.

304
00:13:36,128 --> 00:13:38,959
If you buy things online, there could be a size issue.

305
00:13:38,983 --> 00:13:41,980
- Or you might not like it. - You can check them out in the stores first.

306
00:13:42,084 --> 00:13:45,204
I tried that myself. I went to the store and checked the product.

307
00:13:45,252 --> 00:13:47,666
And I ordered a pair of shoes and they were delivered.

308
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:51,673
They didn't fit my feet, and what's worse, even the size of right and left shoe was different.

309
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,527
- How's that possible? - One of them was 250mm but the other wasn't.

310
00:13:54,552 --> 00:13:57,425
That can happen if you shopping at a strange online mall.

311
00:13:57,425 --> 00:13:59,448
- Yes, Alberto's right. - No.

312
00:13:59,656 --> 00:14:02,495
You can do cross-border shopping if you don't really have to check the product.

313
00:14:02,653 --> 00:14:04,542
But you have to use reliable online stores.

314
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,367
- There are online shopping scams. - Can't you get a refund or return the product?

315
00:14:08,367 --> 00:14:11,375
I can, but it will take so much time.

316
00:14:11,395 --> 00:14:14,555
- It's annoying. - It's irritating to send it back.

317
00:14:14,595 --> 00:14:17,283
I need to send it back to the seller if there's something wrong.

318
00:14:17,652 --> 00:14:19,405
If I buy things at a store, I can just go back to them.

319
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,350
But if you go to the store in person,

320
00:14:21,942 --> 00:14:24,901
sometimes you end up buying things you don't really need...

321
00:14:24,926 --> 00:14:26,926
- because of persistent sales clerks. - Right.

322
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:29,135
- In case of online shopping... - True.

323
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:31,432
It's like "You look so great in this suit."

324
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:34,680
- I don't believe it. - It's the last piece we have.

325
00:14:36,484 --> 00:14:38,830
I can read his face. He already decided to buy.

326
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,880
(You can't resist the last piece.)

327
00:14:41,904 --> 00:14:43,904
We cannot resist the "last one".

328
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:46,543
It's not only about delivery. When I order something,

329
00:14:47,063 --> 00:14:48,653
because I'm not good at English,

330
00:14:48,653 --> 00:14:51,421
it's very stressful to do shopping at English websites.

331
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:55,093
- The stress is huge. - They offer Japanese language support, too.

332
00:14:55,118 --> 00:14:58,653
Just one wrong click could cost you a lot of money.

333
00:14:59,046 --> 00:15:01,917
As I'm not that fluent in English,

334
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:03,942
if I make an order mistake,

335
00:15:04,197 --> 00:15:06,585
or click on something wrong, it may result in a loss of money.

336
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:07,667
Or buying a wrong product.

337
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,171
But you can take your time browsing the process.

338
00:15:10,691 --> 00:15:12,962
No, online shopping in Korea is very complicated.

339
00:15:12,962 --> 00:15:15,679
- ISP and everything. - Yes, online shopping is really difficult.

340
00:15:15,777 --> 00:15:16,969
- True. - So hard.

341
00:15:16,994 --> 00:15:20,800
I fill in all the blanks but sometimes it accidentally goes back to the previous page.

342
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:23,174
It's really annoying.

343
00:15:23,174 --> 00:15:24,882
You need a certificate too.

344
00:15:24,907 --> 00:15:27,283
Yes, authentication certificates.

345
00:15:27,308 --> 00:15:31,050
Even if it's not cross-border shopping, you might be fooled if you buy things only based on their pictures.

346
00:15:31,075 --> 00:15:32,880
I went to a burger place a few days ago.

347
00:15:33,146 --> 00:15:34,888
There was a big signboard.

348
00:15:34,912 --> 00:15:37,504
It has a picture of a gigantic and mouth-watering burger.

349
00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:41,763
It looked so delicious and I ordered one. But the burger served was tiny, like this.

350
00:15:41,788 --> 00:15:44,017
- Don't exaggerate. - You can't feed a fly with it.

351
00:15:44,017 --> 00:15:45,739
I'm telling the truth.

352
00:15:45,739 --> 00:15:47,944
Isn't it the size of a macaroon?

353
00:15:48,012 --> 00:15:49,437
Or "I love you"?

354
00:15:49,476 --> 00:15:50,588
(Satisfied)

355
00:15:50,613 --> 00:15:53,346
- It was different from the picture. - I felt like cheated.

356
00:15:53,346 --> 00:15:55,844
Let me take an example of my own experience.

357
00:15:56,098 --> 00:15:59,193
I need a product that I used to use back in Germany...

358
00:15:59,218 --> 00:16:00,671
but find it's too expensive in Korea.

359
00:16:00,973 --> 00:16:03,439
I already know how much they actually are in my home country.

360
00:16:03,464 --> 00:16:04,830
Products he has used before.

361
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:08,144
Even if you see a product with your own eyes in a store,

362
00:16:08,224 --> 00:16:09,653
you could be cheated.

363
00:16:09,653 --> 00:16:12,532
- The sales clerk will lure you to buy it. - Exactly.

364
00:16:12,532 --> 00:16:15,688
If you really want to know about the products, you can go to a review website.

365
00:16:15,869 --> 00:16:18,822
People who have used the product will recommend you the best one.

366
00:16:18,822 --> 00:16:20,230
Review comments are important.

367
00:16:20,275 --> 00:16:22,534
But I'd like to tell you...

368
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:25,774
reviews by purchasers are mostly fake in China.

369
00:16:25,926 --> 00:16:28,199
- Really? - Yes. They just repeat the same words.

370
00:16:28,327 --> 00:16:30,126
"I love it. I'll buy it again."

371
00:16:30,151 --> 00:16:33,255
"I love it. I'll buy it again." These kinds of comments are repeatedly found.

372
00:16:33,304 --> 00:16:34,847
Seasoned shoppers can tell the difference.

373
00:16:34,871 --> 00:16:39,449
Then can you please talk about products you personally bought through cross-border shopping?

374
00:16:39,487 --> 00:16:41,919
- What did you buy? - About 10 years ago,

375
00:16:42,151 --> 00:16:43,750
when I was working hard on my diet,

376
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:46,998
I wanted to buy some good vitamin supplements but I was totally ignorant.

377
00:16:47,031 --> 00:16:49,647
So I searched the Internet, and fount a research lab...

378
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:53,085
that buys vitamins themselves and studies the ingredients...

379
00:16:53,126 --> 00:16:54,885
themselves.

380
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,605
I bought their products.

381
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:59,567
I lost seven kilograms in a month and my skin got a lot better.

382
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,223
Were you part of their clinical test?

383
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:03,047
No, it must've been a corporate event.

384
00:17:03,071 --> 00:17:05,138
Hang on. I really mean it.

385
00:17:05,184 --> 00:17:07,015
Why don't you try them with my body?

386
00:17:07,597 --> 00:17:08,979
It's nothing like that.

387
00:17:09,011 --> 00:17:11,011
Is your picture posted on their website?

388
00:17:11,107 --> 00:17:12,230
No.

389
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,589
Like a model.

390
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:14,960
Look at how I've changed.

391
00:17:15,528 --> 00:17:17,400
Do I sound like promoting the website?

392
00:17:17,424 --> 00:17:19,999
- I'm talking from my personal experience. - All right.

393
00:17:20,304 --> 00:17:21,527
- I'll check it out. - Good.

394
00:17:21,552 --> 00:17:25,065
What I saw on the TV before I came to Korea was...

395
00:17:25,219 --> 00:17:27,747
so many Korean people wearing stadium jackets.

396
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:31,347
I thought it must be a really cool and popular product there.

397
00:17:31,387 --> 00:17:33,235
So I went to Alibaba in China,

398
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,314
and tried cross-border shopping.

399
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:37,565
The seller said he could send it to me...

400
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:40,544
via international mail. So I decided to buy it.

401
00:17:40,762 --> 00:17:43,550
When when the parcel arrived, I found it was sent somewhere in China.

402
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:46,419
It wasn't international delivery.

403
00:17:46,451 --> 00:17:49,027
I haven't tried it myself, but...

404
00:17:49,051 --> 00:17:53,042
many Mexicans just go to the US for shopping.

405
00:17:53,042 --> 00:17:55,125
Now you need to climb up a wall to go there.

406
00:17:55,276 --> 00:17:58,261
You should learn wall-climbing for shopping.

407
00:17:58,436 --> 00:17:59,644
Climbing.

408
00:17:59,676 --> 00:18:01,405
Maybe it's not possible anymore.

409
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:04,277
Top three US products favored by Mexicans are...

410
00:18:04,469 --> 00:18:06,798
clothes, latest models of mobile phones, and...

411
00:18:06,823 --> 00:18:08,622
cosmetic products.

412
00:18:08,906 --> 00:18:10,048
They are top three.

413
00:18:10,073 --> 00:18:13,319
It's because they are way cheaper in the US than Mexico.

414
00:18:13,344 --> 00:18:16,704
In case of clothes, there are a wide variety of brands in the US.

415
00:18:16,951 --> 00:18:20,435
You can just enter the US on foot.

416
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:22,467
People living in northern Mexico,

417
00:18:22,492 --> 00:18:26,422
which is very close to the Mexico-US border, can walk to the US for shopping.

418
00:18:26,447 --> 00:18:29,813
Look at Mark. His expression says you can't go there on foot.

419
00:18:30,283 --> 00:18:32,483
I'm not sure if you can do that in future as well.

420
00:18:32,762 --> 00:18:34,431
We can build a tunnel then.

421
00:18:35,608 --> 00:18:38,507
I'm worried that you'd make fun of me if you listen to my shopping story.

422
00:18:39,367 --> 00:18:40,914
Does it look like this?

423
00:18:40,939 --> 00:18:44,224
- Come on. - I bought it from the US.

424
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:45,796
No, it's not white porcelain this time.

425
00:18:45,812 --> 00:18:49,387
It's a set of sumaksae made in the era of Three Kingdoms.

426
00:18:49,536 --> 00:18:52,289
- What did you say? - Sumaksae.

427
00:18:52,321 --> 00:18:56,995
- They are circular convex roof-end tiles with a flower or dragon design. - I see.

428
00:18:57,521 --> 00:18:59,032
- But... - Where did you buy it?

429
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:02,929
An American had 23 of those tiles...

430
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,610
Did you buy them in the US?

431
00:19:04,634 --> 00:19:06,781
Why did that person hold them in the States?

432
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,164
There are antique collectors.

433
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,972
They collect precious artifacts.

434
00:19:12,199 --> 00:19:14,575
He's one of those collectors living in the US.

435
00:19:14,942 --> 00:19:18,606
I feel sorry that such artifact of great historical value is held...

436
00:19:18,631 --> 00:19:20,773
in the US, not Korea. I felt it isn't right.

437
00:19:21,156 --> 00:19:24,124
- I wanted to buy and return it to Korea. - But it must've come with...

438
00:19:24,437 --> 00:19:25,741
- a hefty price tag. - Yes.

439
00:19:25,741 --> 00:19:26,995
He redeemed Korea's cultural asset.

440
00:19:26,995 --> 00:19:28,995
I bought all 23 of them.

441
00:19:29,013 --> 00:19:30,366
Did you buy them all?

442
00:19:30,681 --> 00:19:32,797
He has to be realistic.

443
00:19:33,042 --> 00:19:34,994
How much did you pay to him?

444
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:37,556
- I can't tell you. - You can't?

445
00:19:37,923 --> 00:19:40,435
- He's not going to tell. - Why?

446
00:19:41,373 --> 00:19:45,383
As I could buy them only in the States,

447
00:19:45,792 --> 00:19:48,869
- I had to purchase them online. - All right.

448
00:19:48,909 --> 00:19:51,859
I don't really need cross-border shopping.

449
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:54,538
Since my mother is a flight attendant,

450
00:19:54,796 --> 00:19:56,978
- she travels all over the world. - Right.

451
00:19:57,065 --> 00:19:58,522
Your mom is a cross-border shopper.

452
00:19:58,546 --> 00:20:00,106
She can buy anything herself.

453
00:20:00,172 --> 00:20:02,172
So you should treat me well from now on.

454
00:20:02,508 --> 00:20:04,798
If you want to buy something, I'll ask my mother.

455
00:20:04,823 --> 00:20:06,138
I see.

456
00:20:07,077 --> 00:20:08,892
- I need to get along with him. - Do you have...

457
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:11,392
any shopping tips that you want to share with others?

458
00:20:11,417 --> 00:20:13,093
Let's share shopping tips that only you know.

459
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:14,923
Let me share a shopping tip you can use in the States.

460
00:20:14,948 --> 00:20:17,228
I had lived in New York before I came to Korea.

461
00:20:17,253 --> 00:20:20,416
The biggest department store in New York is called Macy's.

462
00:20:20,627 --> 00:20:22,251
It's in midtown, Manhattan.

463
00:20:22,747 --> 00:20:26,306
There's an information desk you can't easily find on the second floor.

464
00:20:26,462 --> 00:20:29,950
If you're foreigners or from other cities of America,

465
00:20:30,457 --> 00:20:33,966
they'll give you 10 percent discount coupons after checking your passport.

466
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:38,322
- It's hidden on the second floor. Not many people know about this. - I see.

467
00:20:38,501 --> 00:20:40,404
They'll give you coupons after checking your passport.

468
00:20:40,757 --> 00:20:42,224
There's a shopping tip I know.

469
00:20:42,385 --> 00:20:44,897
I live in Mok-dong. When I go to Omokgyo department store,

470
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,662
- on every Friday, Saturday and Sunday, - Omokgyo?

471
00:20:47,762 --> 00:20:51,192
they offer huge discounts on designer brands.

472
00:20:51,235 --> 00:20:54,396
They often offer discounts up to 70 or 80 percent.

473
00:20:54,637 --> 00:20:58,422
So I bought a 200-dollar item for only 30 dollars.

474
00:20:59,364 --> 00:21:01,447
When you go to department stores,

475
00:21:01,523 --> 00:21:03,172
it's hard to receive discounts on your purchase.

476
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:05,226
Then you should go shopping at the end of the month.

477
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:08,099
Every company sets...

478
00:21:08,217 --> 00:21:09,896
their sales target every month.

479
00:21:10,157 --> 00:21:12,253
Every employee also has to achieve their sales target.

480
00:21:12,485 --> 00:21:14,557
- At the end of the month... - They have to meet their sales target.

481
00:21:14,692 --> 00:21:15,732
That's right.

482
00:21:15,757 --> 00:21:18,711
- You'll find sales staff who are working really hard. - At the end of the month?

483
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:20,369
Hard-working staff at the end of the month?

484
00:21:21,101 --> 00:21:22,290
It's a great tip.

485
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:25,503
In Pakistan, there's no fixed price.

486
00:21:25,528 --> 00:21:29,591
So depending on how well you negotiate, the price varies.

487
00:21:29,712 --> 00:21:31,154
There's no fixed price?

488
00:21:31,179 --> 00:21:32,879
There are some shops that go by fixed prices.

489
00:21:32,904 --> 00:21:35,803
But most of the stores don't sell things by fixed prices.

490
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:39,007
So if you look rich,

491
00:21:39,389 --> 00:21:41,844
the seller will try to double the price.

492
00:21:42,322 --> 00:21:44,795
So don't take a shower after you get up.

493
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,720
- To look poor? - That's right.

494
00:21:47,253 --> 00:21:49,894
- Try to look poor. - You need to have a runny nose.

495
00:21:50,062 --> 00:21:52,060
If they say the price is 100 dollars,

496
00:21:52,085 --> 00:21:54,684
- Negotiate from 50 dollars? - You should negotiate from 50 dollars.

497
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:59,230
Then you'll be able to buy it at around 70 dollars.

498
00:21:59,262 --> 00:22:01,904
It's a war of nerves. You have to negotiate really well.

499
00:22:01,929 --> 00:22:05,074
- Right. - You can't just go there and buy things at half the price.

500
00:22:05,378 --> 00:22:08,035
I once tried to purchase Jordan shoes in China.

501
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,201
They were promoting it as limited edition.

502
00:22:10,379 --> 00:22:12,253
They said it's 300 dollars.

503
00:22:12,305 --> 00:22:15,327
The person who was standing next to me said 300 dollars is way too expensive.

504
00:22:15,352 --> 00:22:16,379
He said...

505
00:22:16,403 --> 00:22:18,403
- Half the price. - I should knock the price down to half the price.

506
00:22:18,495 --> 00:22:20,882
He said he'll sell it for 250 dollars, but I knocked the price down to 100 dollars.

507
00:22:20,907 --> 00:22:22,643
(I won't sell it then.)

508
00:22:22,668 --> 00:22:24,331
He looked really upset.

509
00:22:24,572 --> 00:22:27,101
- Then the person next to me said, "Pretend you're leaving." - Right.

510
00:22:27,126 --> 00:22:29,249
- So I left. - You have to pretend you're leaving.

511
00:22:29,274 --> 00:22:31,733
I walked about 20m, then the seller said...

512
00:22:31,758 --> 00:22:34,673
(All right. Come back.)

513
00:22:34,698 --> 00:22:36,054
So I bought it for 100 dollars.

514
00:22:36,117 --> 00:22:38,434
- If your looked back after walking 19m... - But the thing is...

515
00:22:38,459 --> 00:22:40,636
the person next to me bought it for 20 dollars.

516
00:22:41,852 --> 00:22:44,592
- Wow. - So we assign roles when I go shopping with my mom.

517
00:22:44,617 --> 00:22:46,568
My mom would go, "This one looks nice."

518
00:22:46,593 --> 00:22:49,403
then I'd say, "Mom, I don't like it. I'll never wear it."

519
00:22:49,428 --> 00:22:51,281
My mom would say, "It looks good on you."

520
00:22:51,306 --> 00:22:53,537
Is this the happy memory you had with your mother?

521
00:22:53,652 --> 00:22:56,776
- You have many good memories. - Actually, we were able to knock the price down.

522
00:22:56,801 --> 00:22:58,170
We bought it at a lower price.

523
00:22:58,195 --> 00:23:01,214
There's a way you can get a discount in Korea.

524
00:23:01,239 --> 00:23:03,239
If you tell old ladies...

525
00:23:03,764 --> 00:23:06,360
how pretty they are,

526
00:23:06,853 --> 00:23:09,094
- they'll really like it and... - Gosh.

527
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:10,506
You're too old-fashioned.

528
00:23:10,531 --> 00:23:11,600
Goodness.

529
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:13,780
- That's such an old method. - Also,

530
00:23:13,805 --> 00:23:15,274
if you sing a trot song...

531
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:17,644
for the old ladies,

532
00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:19,024
they'll love it.

533
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:20,313
What kind of trot songs did you sing?

534
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:22,993
On that green meadow

535
00:23:23,018 --> 00:23:25,720
- I sing this song. - I really want to give you a discount.

536
00:23:26,143 --> 00:23:29,143
- I know. - Perhaps they just want you to leave.

537
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,672
When I was a student,

538
00:23:31,697 --> 00:23:36,028
my friends and I used to get a discount after singing a song.

539
00:23:36,097 --> 00:23:37,732
- What if you can't sing? - We sang this song.

540
00:23:37,757 --> 00:23:39,946
All I can give you

541
00:23:41,341 --> 00:23:43,291
- Is three dollars - Just take it.

542
00:23:43,521 --> 00:23:45,811
- He only had three dollars. - It's...

543
00:23:45,836 --> 00:23:46,854
I'm serious.

544
00:23:46,879 --> 00:23:50,121
My foreign friends came with me and sang a song for them,

545
00:23:50,371 --> 00:23:52,532
so they liked us a lot.

546
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:54,684
That's one way you can get a discount.

547
00:23:54,738 --> 00:23:58,149
- All right. - People say merchants never sell things below cost.

548
00:23:58,174 --> 00:24:00,425
But I have to say it's important...

549
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:02,770
to make a purchase wisely.

550
00:24:02,795 --> 00:24:05,740
- Yes. - I wish the sellers and buyers will both continue...

551
00:24:05,765 --> 00:24:08,359
to benefit from the purchases they make.

552
00:24:08,384 --> 00:24:11,163
- Okay. Let's move on to "What Is So Important". - Yes.

553
00:24:16,127 --> 00:24:17,885
Let's invite the Korean representative to the show.

554
00:24:17,954 --> 00:24:21,933
(Siren sound)

555
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,620
- Are you sick? - He's from the emergency room.

556
00:24:25,718 --> 00:24:27,135
Om Mani padme hum.

557
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:30,402
He is Goong In who diagnoses patients, not Gung Ye.

558
00:24:30,695 --> 00:24:32,806
He's an emergency physician, Namgoong In.

559
00:24:32,831 --> 00:24:34,539
Doctor Namgoong In.

560
00:24:34,564 --> 00:24:36,017
(The 125th Korean representative is Namgoong In.)

561
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:37,214
Welcome.

562
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,598
Hello.

563
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,173
(A doctor who records the boundary between life and death)

564
00:24:43,405 --> 00:24:47,045
(Emergency physician, Namgoong In)

565
00:24:47,247 --> 00:24:49,674
For the first time in our show's history,

566
00:24:49,814 --> 00:24:51,485
we have a guest whose profession is doctor.

567
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:53,218
Please introduce yourself.

568
00:24:53,602 --> 00:24:55,663
I'm an emergency physician.

569
00:24:55,999 --> 00:24:57,698
I published my essays a while ago.

570
00:24:57,723 --> 00:25:01,528
I'm currently working as a medical essayist. I'm Namgoong In.

571
00:25:01,553 --> 00:25:02,602
(Welcome)

572
00:25:02,627 --> 00:25:05,465
- Good to see you. - When we think of emergency rooms,

573
00:25:05,645 --> 00:25:08,053
we think about resident doctors or young doctors...

574
00:25:08,078 --> 00:25:10,453
who work hard at night.

575
00:25:10,629 --> 00:25:11,909
It's a major, right?

576
00:25:11,934 --> 00:25:13,806
Yes, it's a major, and I'm an emergency physician.

577
00:25:14,358 --> 00:25:16,096
- I see. - That's me.

578
00:25:17,084 --> 00:25:19,781
It must be a difficult job. What's good about this major?

579
00:25:19,806 --> 00:25:22,321
It's a profession which you have to take care of patients,

580
00:25:22,346 --> 00:25:25,188
24 hours, 7 days a week at the emergency room.

581
00:25:25,313 --> 00:25:27,445
As a doctor, it's really difficult.

582
00:25:27,501 --> 00:25:29,416
But you get to help and treat the patients...

583
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,440
when they're in emergency situations,

584
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:33,729
so it's a rewarding job.

585
00:25:33,753 --> 00:25:35,356
That's what's good about this major.

586
00:25:35,686 --> 00:25:38,916
This is the 125th Non Summit Meeting. We will now begin our discussion.

587
00:25:39,098 --> 00:25:41,143
Namgoong In, what's the topic you'd like to discuss today?

588
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:44,373
I'm an emergency physician with eight years of experience,

589
00:25:44,673 --> 00:25:47,663
who has to make fast and wise decisions.

590
00:25:47,973 --> 00:25:49,649
That's why I brought this topic today.

591
00:25:49,904 --> 00:25:54,454
"Sometimes, emotional feelings come before rational decisions."

592
00:25:54,851 --> 00:25:55,975
"Am I abnormal?"

593
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:59,661
It's a question that doctors will feel differently.

594
00:25:59,686 --> 00:26:01,789
- For us, it's a different question. - Yes.

595
00:26:01,814 --> 00:26:04,451
I wouldn't like doctors without emotions.

596
00:26:05,072 --> 00:26:06,528
I wouldn't like emotional doctors...

597
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,274
who'd shake their hands out of frustration.

598
00:26:09,549 --> 00:26:11,462
I don't want them to look after me.

599
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:12,963
You're going to get a shot.

600
00:26:13,563 --> 00:26:15,385
It's going to hurt a lot.

601
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:16,565
(It will hurt a lot.)

602
00:26:16,945 --> 00:26:19,816
Sometimes, emotional feelings come first, depending on the situation.

603
00:26:19,841 --> 00:26:21,187
Do you tend to get emotional?

604
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:24,996
As for me, emotional feelings tend to come first.

605
00:26:25,073 --> 00:26:28,689
There was this one particular patient who made me really emotional.

606
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,658
He was a man in his 50s.

607
00:26:30,683 --> 00:26:33,452
He tried to kill himself by taking drugs.

608
00:26:33,649 --> 00:26:36,415
Fortunately, he didn't take too much drugs.

609
00:26:36,699 --> 00:26:38,402
He was willing to live after he woke up.

610
00:26:38,427 --> 00:26:41,140
He was very cooperative and even received psychiatric treatments.

611
00:26:41,207 --> 00:26:44,549
So I told him to live his life and encouraged him.

612
00:26:45,068 --> 00:26:47,719
After two hours, a dead person had arrived at the emergency room.

613
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,081
I was told he fell from the seventh floor.

614
00:26:49,532 --> 00:26:52,590
When I looked at his face, it was the patient who left two hours ago.

615
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:55,404
He really wanted to die.

616
00:26:55,612 --> 00:26:56,984
So he was acting in front of me.

617
00:26:57,317 --> 00:26:58,686
He was pretending he was okay.

618
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,428
That kind of incident is just...

619
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:04,716
Also, one of my jobs is...

620
00:27:04,741 --> 00:27:06,564
to evaluate the recordings of 119 rescuers,

621
00:27:06,787 --> 00:27:10,092
when they help out the callers and give medical advice.

622
00:27:10,117 --> 00:27:11,594
To see if they gave the right advice?

623
00:27:11,619 --> 00:27:13,193
Yes, people collapse, right?

624
00:27:13,347 --> 00:27:16,391
If you think about it, it can be one of your family members.

625
00:27:16,652 --> 00:27:19,532
They're near death. It's the worst moment.

626
00:27:19,778 --> 00:27:21,920
You can hear people wailing from the recordings.

627
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:23,935
People scream, too.

628
00:27:24,321 --> 00:27:26,998
I have to evaluate 100 recordings every month.

629
00:27:27,627 --> 00:27:29,817
So I suffered from insomnia.

630
00:27:30,285 --> 00:27:32,921
It's something you can't feel unemotional about.

631
00:27:33,014 --> 00:27:35,014
Have you ever cried at the emergency room?

632
00:27:35,394 --> 00:27:36,730
I get emotional but...

633
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:37,910
- You hold it back. - Yes.

634
00:27:37,935 --> 00:27:40,053
Doctors who cry with the patients...

635
00:27:40,245 --> 00:27:41,930
are not actually good doctors. You can't trust them.

636
00:27:42,156 --> 00:27:43,991
You can't cry in front of the patients.

637
00:27:44,247 --> 00:27:46,432
I go to the back of the emergency room and cry.

638
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:47,865
That's what I do.

639
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,325
- It's a difficult job. - Yes.

640
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:52,652
"Sometimes, emotional feelings come before rational decisions. Am I abnormal?"

641
00:27:52,677 --> 00:27:54,595
That's today's topic. We will now begin the discussion.

642
00:27:55,581 --> 00:27:59,120
If you think it's abnormal, please press the button.

643
00:27:59,689 --> 00:28:01,283
One, two, three. Press the button.

644
00:28:02,741 --> 00:28:04,710
It's about getting yourself together.

645
00:28:04,735 --> 00:28:06,658
He's saying it's abnormal.

646
00:28:06,683 --> 00:28:08,859
Alberto thinks it's okay.

647
00:28:08,936 --> 00:28:11,834
Doctors and nurses are people, too.

648
00:28:12,146 --> 00:28:13,737
Even the patients are people, right?

649
00:28:13,762 --> 00:28:16,613
When people meet together, you're bound to feel emotions.

650
00:28:16,638 --> 00:28:18,852
We, as patients,

651
00:28:18,991 --> 00:28:21,154
I also prefer doctors who express their emotions...

652
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:24,317
- to doctors who are cold-hearted. - That's right.

653
00:28:24,342 --> 00:28:27,665
From what I know, they receive a training before they become doctors.

654
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:30,664
They're taught they can't get emotional about patients.

655
00:28:30,689 --> 00:28:33,935
- Right. - In my opinion, humans have evolved...

656
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,479
and became the wisest animal in the world.

657
00:28:36,504 --> 00:28:39,723
- So I think we're able to control our emotions. - The wisest animal?

658
00:28:39,748 --> 00:28:41,122
It's...

659
00:28:41,147 --> 00:28:43,345
Are you saying Namgoong In isn't wise then?

660
00:28:43,431 --> 00:28:45,243
That's is the reason why...

661
00:28:45,268 --> 00:28:47,665
we can hide and not express our emotions.

662
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:51,007
When I go to the hospital, I don't expect the doctors to be considerate.

663
00:28:51,117 --> 00:28:52,454
I just want them to treat me well.

664
00:28:52,479 --> 00:28:55,626
I think emotions can make them treat you better.

665
00:28:55,893 --> 00:28:57,223
- Yes. - That's right.

666
00:28:57,248 --> 00:28:58,953
If they want to make you live...

667
00:28:58,978 --> 00:29:00,960
- The doctors... - I mean...

668
00:29:00,985 --> 00:29:02,078
- Oogi, - What?

669
00:29:02,103 --> 00:29:04,234
you can also make mistakes when you get emotional.

670
00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:06,511
Rational decisions and actions...

671
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,549
are more helpful when you try to save a patient's life.

672
00:29:10,986 --> 00:29:12,710
- Is it more important? - That's right.

673
00:29:12,735 --> 00:29:14,325
In emergency rooms,

674
00:29:14,781 --> 00:29:18,126
- doctors have to save lives of the patients urgently. - Yes.

675
00:29:18,362 --> 00:29:20,550
If your decision is delayed a little,

676
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:23,520
or if you make a wrong decision, you can kill a person.

677
00:29:23,587 --> 00:29:25,928
Doctors will take the responsibility...

678
00:29:25,953 --> 00:29:29,148
until the day they die. They're living with that sense of responsibility.

679
00:29:29,173 --> 00:29:30,755
I agree with Xinlin.

680
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:33,788
I tend to sympathize with other people often.

681
00:29:34,018 --> 00:29:36,162
So I knew that...

682
00:29:36,187 --> 00:29:38,244
I could never be a doctor.

683
00:29:38,269 --> 00:29:39,592
- Me, too. - You get emotional.

684
00:29:39,688 --> 00:29:43,362
I think you can be a doctor, but you can't be an emergency physician.

685
00:29:43,447 --> 00:29:45,110
People who tend to get emotional...

686
00:29:45,748 --> 00:29:47,923
should avoid certain professions.

687
00:29:47,948 --> 00:29:49,528
For example, the president of United States of America.

688
00:29:50,201 --> 00:29:53,786
- Let's say the president of the US is annoyed, - All right.

689
00:29:53,811 --> 00:29:56,047
and if he's willing to use the nuclear weapons...

690
00:29:57,018 --> 00:29:59,257
You have to be able to control your emotions.

691
00:29:59,282 --> 00:30:02,194
I don't know how the doctors really feel, but from a patient's perspective,

692
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,189
The warmth from a doctor...

693
00:30:04,214 --> 00:30:06,672
can help a little to heal the patient.

694
00:30:06,697 --> 00:30:08,982
The reason for this is, when we got sick as children,

695
00:30:09,233 --> 00:30:11,160
and our mom just patted us on the head.

696
00:30:11,185 --> 00:30:12,990
The fever dropped and we felt safe, right?

697
00:30:13,015 --> 00:30:14,507
If you want to be loved,

698
00:30:14,553 --> 00:30:17,366
you should go to your mom instead of going to see a doctor.

699
00:30:17,391 --> 00:30:19,195
He's a very cold person.

700
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,313
Why would you go to a doctor?

701
00:30:20,338 --> 00:30:21,453
That's true.

702
00:30:21,478 --> 00:30:24,774
Let's say I received treatment and I died while I received it.

703
00:30:24,845 --> 00:30:26,628
And let's say the doctor cried for me.

704
00:30:26,836 --> 00:30:28,515
After that happened, let's say Oogi showed up.

705
00:30:28,541 --> 00:30:30,780
Oogi sees the doctor crying.

706
00:30:31,073 --> 00:30:32,452
Then how would Oogi feel?

707
00:30:32,477 --> 00:30:34,071
Right?

708
00:30:34,096 --> 00:30:35,605
You wouldn't be able to trust him.

709
00:30:35,818 --> 00:30:36,992
I wouldn't mind.

710
00:30:38,097 --> 00:30:39,200
(I'd be okay with that.)

711
00:30:39,226 --> 00:30:41,711
He's in the emergency room, he wouldn't be in the right state of mind.

712
00:30:41,843 --> 00:30:43,681
You just look sick.

713
00:30:43,902 --> 00:30:45,470
I'm too emotional,

714
00:30:45,494 --> 00:30:48,145
so I can't make an objective call on this.

715
00:30:48,171 --> 00:30:49,493
I don't understand that.

716
00:30:49,877 --> 00:30:51,950
When I watch a drama,

717
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,761
I cry like there is no tomorrow.

718
00:30:54,387 --> 00:30:57,195
But I still can make objective decisions.

719
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,341
What kind of decisions do you make while you watch the drama?

720
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:02,569
I make all kinds of decisions.

721
00:31:03,547 --> 00:31:05,035
Do you cry in another room away from the TV?

722
00:31:05,903 --> 00:31:07,107
Do you cry in a room without a TV?

723
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:10,091
Now, first of all,

724
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:14,046
I would like to ask you about how professionals in medicine are perceived.

725
00:31:14,235 --> 00:31:17,196
In China we have the saying, "To help the dying and heal the injured".

726
00:31:17,298 --> 00:31:20,385
What that means is, they heal those who are about to die.

727
00:31:20,419 --> 00:31:21,585
It's a good image.

728
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:23,429
That's why recently in China,

729
00:31:23,454 --> 00:31:25,687
they showed us videos of doctors working.

730
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,605
It's truly a sad sight.

731
00:31:27,771 --> 00:31:30,523
The doctor comes into the emergency room vomiting blood.

732
00:31:30,944 --> 00:31:33,697
Yes, and the nurses are sick as well.

733
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:36,500
They also need to have an injection, but they don't have the time.

734
00:31:36,598 --> 00:31:38,207
They get the injection while they eat.

735
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:40,323
- It's very serious. - It's because there isn't enough nurses.

736
00:31:40,348 --> 00:31:42,255
We don't have enough doctors, either.

737
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,984
According to one survey, there are 2,3 doctors to every 1,000 patients.

738
00:31:46,735 --> 00:31:49,692
It's apparently the worst among all the G7 countries.

739
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:51,764
- That's way too few. - Yes, so it is a problem.

740
00:31:51,789 --> 00:31:55,266
Normally people think of doctors as...

741
00:31:55,291 --> 00:31:56,912
a male occupation.

742
00:31:57,197 --> 00:32:00,539
Doctors are also seen as rich. What shocked me about nurses in Korea was...

743
00:32:00,808 --> 00:32:03,018
that nurses were perceived negatively in Korea.

744
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:04,266
In Korea?

745
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:06,182
- There are discriminated. - Yes, there is a little bit of that.

746
00:32:06,503 --> 00:32:09,414
Nurses are a specialized profession.

747
00:32:09,439 --> 00:32:11,364
Some people treat them badly.

748
00:32:11,389 --> 00:32:14,756
Some people also still refer to them using the old colonial title.

749
00:32:14,937 --> 00:32:17,398
And when female doctors, especially young female doctors,

750
00:32:17,847 --> 00:32:20,207
go to a patient and explain their diagnosis.

751
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:23,260
The patient listens for a while and then asks when the male doctor arrives.

752
00:32:23,318 --> 00:32:26,030
- Do you mean elderly people? - Yes, some elderly people still act like that.

753
00:32:26,055 --> 00:32:28,299
The gender discrimination in the medical field...

754
00:32:28,324 --> 00:32:30,678
- is a serious problem in our country. - It still is a problem.

755
00:32:30,703 --> 00:32:32,703
We used to have that kind of discrimination in the US as well.

756
00:32:32,781 --> 00:32:35,298
There was of course a little bit of discrimination...

757
00:32:35,323 --> 00:32:37,799
against female nurses.

758
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:40,419
It is changing. We recently came up with a new title called nurse practitioners.

759
00:32:40,445 --> 00:32:41,467
Nurse practitioner.

760
00:32:41,493 --> 00:32:43,311
They are nurses who are qualified to treat certain medical...

761
00:32:43,337 --> 00:32:44,603
problems without supervision from a doctor.

762
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:47,448
- They are creating this. - The status of nurses has gone up.

763
00:32:47,546 --> 00:32:49,410
- Yes. - In the case of Mexico,

764
00:32:49,657 --> 00:32:52,801
the cut-line for the university admission of doctors and nurses are the same.

765
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,018
They are the same but the medical techniques...

766
00:32:55,043 --> 00:32:56,977
at Mexico aren't that advanced.

767
00:32:57,002 --> 00:33:00,916
So when people are sick or are in need of surgery,

768
00:33:01,252 --> 00:33:03,777
they go over to the US. They believe...

769
00:33:03,802 --> 00:33:05,945
that their medical hospitals are safer.

770
00:33:06,296 --> 00:33:09,782
- What about in Switzerland? - Switzerland has a very good healthcare system.

771
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:12,215
So, people have their own personal physician.

772
00:33:13,251 --> 00:33:14,603
(Switzerland's standard is different.)

773
00:33:14,629 --> 00:33:16,292
- It's different. - Switzerland's standard is different.

774
00:33:16,317 --> 00:33:17,334
That's different.

775
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:19,054
- It's the same in France. - Is that so?

776
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,303
We have a family physician.

777
00:33:20,328 --> 00:33:21,668
We have that as well.

778
00:33:21,693 --> 00:33:22,951
We have that system as well.

779
00:33:22,976 --> 00:33:24,391
- I see. - Do you?

780
00:33:24,416 --> 00:33:25,532
Because...

781
00:33:25,557 --> 00:33:27,830
Is that system only for rich people?

782
00:33:27,855 --> 00:33:29,052
- No. - It's for everyone.

783
00:33:29,077 --> 00:33:31,642
- We have that system as well. - That's the obligation...

784
00:33:31,667 --> 00:33:34,055
of our healthcare system but it is expensive.

785
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,032
You have to about 350 dollars a month.

786
00:33:37,134 --> 00:33:39,877
But the system is great so if you have any problems,

787
00:33:39,903 --> 00:33:42,232
you can just call up your doctor.

788
00:33:42,257 --> 00:33:43,343
That's great.

789
00:33:43,368 --> 00:33:45,150
When you say family doctor, does that mean...

790
00:33:45,175 --> 00:33:46,882
- the doctor only takes care of one family? - No.

791
00:33:46,907 --> 00:33:49,657
This family just calls to the same doctor.

792
00:33:49,682 --> 00:33:51,701
- Yes. - I mean, that doctor...

793
00:33:52,297 --> 00:33:53,726
has his own life as well.

794
00:33:53,751 --> 00:33:55,468
What does the doctor do if the family is healthy?

795
00:33:55,932 --> 00:33:58,309
- That's good for the family. - In Europe,

796
00:33:58,341 --> 00:34:00,024
Italy and Germany both have that system as well.

797
00:34:00,049 --> 00:34:02,470
We don't go to see a doctor that often.

798
00:34:02,495 --> 00:34:03,817
No, we are different.

799
00:34:03,843 --> 00:34:06,651
You have your own personal doctor, and of course it's free.

800
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,204
The country pays for it.

801
00:34:09,229 --> 00:34:12,302
- That's great. - When you're really sick, the doctor will tell you...

802
00:34:12,328 --> 00:34:14,180
- to go to the hospital. - He'll tell you which hospital to go to.

803
00:34:14,206 --> 00:34:15,633
- Right. - They connect you to the hospital.

804
00:34:15,658 --> 00:34:18,853
In Germany, we don't have enough doctors.

805
00:34:19,271 --> 00:34:21,032
Compared to the other countries,

806
00:34:21,057 --> 00:34:23,599
doctors and nurses don't get paid a lot.

807
00:34:23,923 --> 00:34:26,541
So when you are a doctor or a nurse in Germany,

808
00:34:26,762 --> 00:34:29,148
you are seen as doing charity work.

809
00:34:29,173 --> 00:34:30,316
(Doctors are seen as doing charity work.)

810
00:34:30,352 --> 00:34:33,057
Are there any stereotypes then?

811
00:34:33,082 --> 00:34:34,149
- Like... - Right.

812
00:34:34,174 --> 00:34:36,337
I do have a personal prejudice.

813
00:34:36,504 --> 00:34:38,644
I thought that I would never...

814
00:34:38,669 --> 00:34:41,676
get ill. I didn't think I would.

815
00:34:42,486 --> 00:34:43,808
Because you're a doctor.

816
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:46,398
I asked a doctor that I know about this.

817
00:34:46,605 --> 00:34:50,278
We know people who get ill quite easily.

818
00:34:50,303 --> 00:34:53,575
- Immune system. - Thanks to that our immune system has gotten stronger.

819
00:34:53,974 --> 00:34:56,352
In truth the university hospitals are...

820
00:34:56,377 --> 00:34:58,841
the first to experience the rising viruses in society.

821
00:34:59,605 --> 00:35:02,587
So at first, the people who work there catch all the rising viruses.

822
00:35:02,612 --> 00:35:04,722
Which one is the strongest?

823
00:35:04,747 --> 00:35:05,936
It's like "Superstar Virus".

824
00:35:06,641 --> 00:35:08,646
But as you work there, you get better.

825
00:35:08,867 --> 00:35:10,609
- You don't get sick. - That could happen.

826
00:35:10,634 --> 00:35:12,575
- You become immune. - You don't catch it easily.

827
00:35:12,617 --> 00:35:15,326
They say people with tattoos recover faster.

828
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:16,977
Is that true?

829
00:35:17,002 --> 00:35:18,906
- Is that true? - They've become immune.

830
00:35:18,931 --> 00:35:20,023
That's what they said.

831
00:35:20,048 --> 00:35:21,775
Because they've had so many wounds.

832
00:35:21,852 --> 00:35:24,172
How often would you have to meet viruses for you to be like that.

833
00:35:24,325 --> 00:35:28,168
In Japan, we have three stereotypes. The first is all doctors are rich.

834
00:35:28,193 --> 00:35:30,306
The second is they are out of their minds.

835
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:32,803
Because they don't react to seeing blood.

836
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:33,960
They're out of their minds.

837
00:35:33,985 --> 00:35:35,494
(Dizzy)

838
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:38,183
I mean, you have to bear those kinds of situations, right?

839
00:35:38,208 --> 00:35:39,883
- Yes. - So, there is that.

840
00:35:39,942 --> 00:35:41,535
The third stereotype is they are erotic.

841
00:35:42,064 --> 00:35:43,672
- Erotic? - Why are doctors erotic?

842
00:35:43,924 --> 00:35:45,643
It's because of adult videos.

843
00:35:46,652 --> 00:35:48,109
- I see. - That's why.

844
00:35:48,142 --> 00:35:49,957
- There are a lot of nurses. - That's right.

845
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:51,385
(Embarrassed)

846
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,134
Why do those Japanese videos...

847
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:54,524
- have doctors as the main characters. - Right.

848
00:35:54,549 --> 00:35:57,139
The clothes in the videos are different to the ones in real life, right?

849
00:35:57,171 --> 00:35:58,917
- No, they don't. - Who would wear that?

850
00:35:58,949 --> 00:36:01,117
- Exactly. - It wouldn't be practical.

851
00:36:01,142 --> 00:36:02,476
You seem to know a lot.

852
00:36:02,501 --> 00:36:03,639
How do you know so well?

853
00:36:03,664 --> 00:36:05,075
You must've watched a lot.

854
00:36:05,107 --> 00:36:07,082
How do you know if they're practical or not?

855
00:36:07,107 --> 00:36:09,479
I took a glimpse to see their image.

856
00:36:09,511 --> 00:36:11,101
- As a doctor? - Yes, as a doctor.

857
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:13,132
- How we are perceived. - Was it for research, then?

858
00:36:13,165 --> 00:36:15,374
- Nurses don't wear skirts. - Exactly.

859
00:36:15,523 --> 00:36:17,210
I don't know how that image came about.

860
00:36:17,249 --> 00:36:19,116
In Mexico, the nurses...

861
00:36:19,361 --> 00:36:21,796
write the prescription down...

862
00:36:22,045 --> 00:36:23,626
with a pen in their own handwriting.

863
00:36:23,651 --> 00:36:26,662
Most of the time, the doctors write the prescriptions hastily,

864
00:36:26,688 --> 00:36:28,516
that the patients worry that the nurses won't be able to read it.

865
00:36:28,541 --> 00:36:29,707
They write it in like an Arabic script.

866
00:36:29,733 --> 00:36:31,133
That's right.

867
00:36:31,158 --> 00:36:33,453
In Mexico, the patients...

868
00:36:33,478 --> 00:36:36,137
need to take it to a pharmacy and pick up the prescription.

869
00:36:36,162 --> 00:36:38,639
- They have to order it themselves. - We don't do that anymore.

870
00:36:38,664 --> 00:36:41,016
This happened to me. Once I couldn't read it...

871
00:36:41,064 --> 00:36:42,474
so I just gave it to the pharmacist.

872
00:36:42,499 --> 00:36:43,792
The pharmacist looked at it.

873
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,838
- "What did he write?" - He didn't know?

874
00:36:45,863 --> 00:36:48,130
In the end, I had to go back to the hospital.

875
00:36:48,155 --> 00:36:51,765
I asked the doctor to write it so it is readable.

876
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:54,311
This was such a serious problem,

877
00:36:54,528 --> 00:36:56,254
that one person...

878
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,496
made a medical alphabet.

879
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:01,417
If you look at it, "A" is written like this.

880
00:37:01,561 --> 00:37:02,741
That would be confusing.

881
00:37:02,766 --> 00:37:04,054
(Medical alphabet)

882
00:37:04,103 --> 00:37:06,493
The pharmacist might read it incorrectly and prescribe you the wrong one.

883
00:37:06,538 --> 00:37:07,676
That would be dangerous.

884
00:37:07,701 --> 00:37:09,869
That happened to us as well, but we now type everything out.

885
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,345
They use the mouse and type everything.

886
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:13,030
Exactly, the Korean system is so convenient.

887
00:37:13,055 --> 00:37:15,482
In the emergency room, we still write everything out by hand.

888
00:37:15,507 --> 00:37:17,267
- It's because you don't have time, right? - Yes.

889
00:37:17,292 --> 00:37:20,540
A person actually took a picture of what the doctor had written down...

890
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:22,304
and uploaded it to his social media account.

891
00:37:22,654 --> 00:37:23,922
No one could write what he had written.

892
00:37:23,948 --> 00:37:25,638
- Is it the same in China? - Yes, no one could read it.

893
00:37:25,664 --> 00:37:26,729
What is that scribbling?

894
00:37:26,754 --> 00:37:28,366
That's harsh.

895
00:37:28,391 --> 00:37:29,707
That's crossing the line.

896
00:37:29,732 --> 00:37:32,776
- Did someone really do that? - Doctors got fined because of this.

897
00:37:32,801 --> 00:37:34,992
I do have something to make public.

898
00:37:35,017 --> 00:37:37,402
The words that doctors write down...

899
00:37:37,595 --> 00:37:39,949
is not Latin or German,

900
00:37:39,974 --> 00:37:42,669
it's all English. But it's not the handwriting...

901
00:37:42,774 --> 00:37:45,491
they are just writing down the English letters like that.

902
00:37:45,516 --> 00:37:46,729
- Is it because they are in a hurry? - Yes.

903
00:37:46,754 --> 00:37:49,222
The doctors in the US do the same thing.

904
00:37:49,247 --> 00:37:50,723
It's the same in Canada, too.

905
00:37:50,748 --> 00:37:52,859
We can't read what the doctor wrote.

906
00:37:52,884 --> 00:37:54,578
I think it's the same for everywhere around the world.

907
00:37:54,603 --> 00:37:56,923
- It's the same in Italy. - Maybe all doctors have an agreement.

908
00:37:56,948 --> 00:37:59,408
- I mean, it's my native tongue. - Are the doctors showing off?

909
00:37:59,433 --> 00:38:01,824
- Or is it because they are busy? - They write it like that because they're busy.

910
00:38:02,305 --> 00:38:04,923
- So, they're not showing off even a little? - They wrote it very slowly.

911
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:06,233
They might've been showing off.

912
00:38:06,258 --> 00:38:07,472
(They might have been showing off.)

913
00:38:07,497 --> 00:38:09,518
They wrote it down like that even when it wasn't an emergency.

914
00:38:09,543 --> 00:38:11,734
If we write it in block form, it might be embarrassing for the patient.

915
00:38:13,298 --> 00:38:15,863
In China, when you think of doctors,

916
00:38:16,047 --> 00:38:18,863
the first word we come up with is a red envelope.

917
00:38:19,488 --> 00:38:23,084
We have to pay the doctor first before we are treated.

918
00:38:23,413 --> 00:38:26,003
You have to pay them if you want to be treated properly.

919
00:38:26,396 --> 00:38:27,516
So...

920
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:29,104
The doctor isn't asking for the money, right?

921
00:38:29,129 --> 00:38:31,478
- But we pay him first. - We hand it to him.

922
00:38:31,562 --> 00:38:32,885
"Please take care of me."

923
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,098
How much do you have to pay him?

924
00:38:34,123 --> 00:38:37,669
My cousin had surgery three years ago.

925
00:38:37,883 --> 00:38:40,067
We paid him around 350 dollars.

926
00:38:40,287 --> 00:38:43,533
Because at that time, I told my aunt not to pay him.

927
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:45,915
"It's not like he will kill her because we didn't pay him."

928
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:47,743
I was really angry.

929
00:38:47,919 --> 00:38:49,927
My aunt just said, "You just don't understand yet."

930
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:52,357
We are asking him to take more care of her in the surgery.

931
00:38:52,382 --> 00:38:54,195
It's to ask the doctor to take more care.

932
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,488
You do have to pay him for that.

933
00:38:55,513 --> 00:38:57,965
Apparently in each country, you have branches of medicine...

934
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:59,227
that are more popular than others?

935
00:38:59,252 --> 00:39:01,092
Right. It's different in each country.

936
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,800
- It'll be the same in our country as well. - Yes.

937
00:39:02,825 --> 00:39:04,178
- Right. - In Japan,

938
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:06,227
Internal medicine is the most popular.

939
00:39:06,252 --> 00:39:08,816
According to a survey it was number 1 with 33 percent of the votes.

940
00:39:09,183 --> 00:39:10,487
- Because... - That is fascinating.

941
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,853
(Various medical comics has internal medicine as the theme.)

942
00:39:12,878 --> 00:39:15,856
Internal medicine is the starting point of medicine.

943
00:39:15,881 --> 00:39:17,751
It focuses on everything.

944
00:39:17,776 --> 00:39:20,826
The salary is high so a lot of people are attracted to that.

945
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:24,806
The branch of medicine that pays the most is the department of ophthalmology.

946
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:28,022
We're an aging society, a lot of the population has cataract.

947
00:39:28,047 --> 00:39:29,831
- It's an aging society. - A lot of people are affected by that.

948
00:39:29,857 --> 00:39:31,448
They finish the surgery in one day.

949
00:39:31,774 --> 00:39:34,469
The circulation is good like a ramen restaurant.

950
00:39:34,941 --> 00:39:36,334
People come and leave.

951
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:37,478
Like a restaurant.

952
00:39:38,059 --> 00:39:39,286
They make a lot of money.

953
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,394
You called it a ramen house.

954
00:39:41,419 --> 00:39:42,929
"Like a ramen house."

955
00:39:43,917 --> 00:39:44,924
It's the same with us.

956
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:48,594
Men select the surgery department while women select internal medicine.

957
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:51,567
The surgery department requires the doctors to have a lot of endurance.

958
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:54,136
Women tend to be more detail-orientated.

959
00:39:54,161 --> 00:39:56,025
And you have to be able to a methodical check in internal medicine.

960
00:39:56,051 --> 00:39:59,353
In Korea, surgeons look cool but they don't get paid a lot, right?

961
00:39:59,428 --> 00:40:02,259
Right. So becoming a surgeon is less popular.

962
00:40:02,284 --> 00:40:04,579
Yes, it's becoming less popular.

963
00:40:04,621 --> 00:40:06,631
- What branch makes a lot? - Plastic surgeons.

964
00:40:06,631 --> 00:40:08,532
It's plastic surgeons and dermatologists.

965
00:40:08,557 --> 00:40:10,177
Plastic surgeons and dermatologists.

966
00:40:10,203 --> 00:40:11,645
Internal medicine gets paid a lot as well, right?

967
00:40:11,671 --> 00:40:14,119
- The pay had gone up... - Has it gone down?

968
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:16,718
but after it had been allowed to be covered by insurance, it dropped.

969
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:21,366
How much does a doctor in the emergency department make?

970
00:40:21,398 --> 00:40:23,962
The emergency department wasn't popular.

971
00:40:23,987 --> 00:40:25,955
But since we take care of people in pain who come to us,

972
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,809
this is to help improve the people's lives. We're directly...

973
00:40:28,834 --> 00:40:30,258
- connected to that. - Right.

974
00:40:30,283 --> 00:40:32,547
We do receive funding,

975
00:40:32,547 --> 00:40:34,779
so we are just barely able to function.

976
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:38,149
Why does the popularity drop when it can get covered by insurance?

977
00:40:38,174 --> 00:40:40,132
When that happens the price becomes set.

978
00:40:40,157 --> 00:40:41,885
When it gets covered by insurance,

979
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:44,210
you can only charge the set price.

980
00:40:44,235 --> 00:40:48,183
In the case of having no insurance liability, it doesn't follow the market.

981
00:40:48,183 --> 00:40:49,354
I see that happening.

982
00:40:49,379 --> 00:40:50,704
What branch is popular in France?

983
00:40:50,704 --> 00:40:52,155
- Internal medicine? - I see.

984
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,402
That's number one.

985
00:40:53,427 --> 00:40:55,282
Dermatology is number two.

986
00:40:55,911 --> 00:41:00,138
Anesthesiology is having a hard time right now.

987
00:41:00,163 --> 00:41:02,070
Because there is a chance that you might kill someone.

988
00:41:02,095 --> 00:41:04,298
- You might kill a patient. - That is a huge risk.

989
00:41:04,323 --> 00:41:05,778
You could kill someone.

990
00:41:05,803 --> 00:41:08,418
- In Italy, anesthesiology is number one. - Why?

991
00:41:08,618 --> 00:41:11,418
It's not that difficult to get into.

992
00:41:11,682 --> 00:41:13,754
And it's easy to get a job after you graduate.

993
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:15,763
- That's anesthesiology. - You can get a job straight away, right?

994
00:41:15,763 --> 00:41:18,022
Also diagnostic radiology is popular as well.

995
00:41:18,022 --> 00:41:20,733
Surgeons and internal medicine is also popular as well.

996
00:41:20,758 --> 00:41:23,373
- That's similar to Mexico. - Plastic surgeons...

997
00:41:23,846 --> 00:41:25,179
are not even the top 30.

998
00:41:25,544 --> 00:41:28,040
- It's 42nd. - Plastic surgeons.

999
00:41:28,066 --> 00:41:29,882
- Is it because everyone is good-looking? - No, that's not it.

1000
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:32,267
- He's annoying. - I know.

1001
00:41:32,292 --> 00:41:34,142
"I don't know why plastic surgery is so popular."

1002
00:41:34,168 --> 00:41:35,206
(I don't need it.)

1003
00:41:35,876 --> 00:41:38,888
Our hospitals are owned by the nation.

1004
00:41:39,417 --> 00:41:42,034
So there aren't many hospitals with a plastic surgery department.

1005
00:41:42,059 --> 00:41:45,058
- It's not easy to get a job. - You have to run your own hospital.

1006
00:41:45,437 --> 00:41:47,488
Then, you would need capital.

1007
00:41:47,513 --> 00:41:49,175
You'd have to pay a lot of taxes as well.

1008
00:41:49,175 --> 00:41:52,447
In Germany, we don't have a department for plastic surgery.

1009
00:41:52,828 --> 00:41:54,382
We don't even acknowledge it as an occupation.

1010
00:41:54,986 --> 00:41:56,547
- We... - You don't acknowledge it as an occupation.

1011
00:41:56,572 --> 00:42:00,795
Anyone who has learned how to do that kind of surgery can open a hospital.

1012
00:42:02,048 --> 00:42:05,641
In Mexico, the most popular branch of medicine is obstetrics,

1013
00:42:05,696 --> 00:42:07,694
pediatrics and anesthesiology.

1014
00:42:08,104 --> 00:42:12,062
These three are the most popular in Mexico because of the high birth rate.

1015
00:42:12,209 --> 00:42:15,702
- The birth rate is really high so... - because of the birth rate.

1016
00:42:15,702 --> 00:42:17,472
it's easy to get a job related to that.

1017
00:42:17,472 --> 00:42:19,241
In our country, obstetricians don't get paid that much.

1018
00:42:19,241 --> 00:42:21,181
- Right. It's not financially rewarding. - We have a low birth rate.

1019
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:24,623
- What is the emergency room like in your respective countries? - I'm curious.

1020
00:42:24,623 --> 00:42:27,237
We have something called "Doctor Heli" in Japan.

1021
00:42:27,364 --> 00:42:30,643
- Doctor Heli? - Yes, they use a helicopter to pick up the patient.

1022
00:42:30,668 --> 00:42:32,196
This attracted the public's attention...

1023
00:42:32,221 --> 00:42:34,948
because of a 2008 TV drama called, "Code Blue".

1024
00:42:34,973 --> 00:42:37,452
It's drama set in an emergency room.

1025
00:42:37,476 --> 00:42:39,619
After that was aired, this caught the public's eye.

1026
00:42:40,051 --> 00:42:41,813
It was used a lot after the earthquake struck as well.

1027
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:45,368
Because you can get there fast and it can get to those hard to reach places.

1028
00:42:45,755 --> 00:42:48,933
It's a well-run system and I hope it will continue to be like that in the future.

1029
00:42:48,958 --> 00:42:50,958
In Switzerland, a lot of people go climbing, right?

1030
00:42:50,983 --> 00:42:55,480
So like Japan, we also have a rescue helicopter as well.

1031
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,790
- However... - This service is called Rega.

1032
00:42:57,815 --> 00:42:59,781
There are many cows up on high mountains as well, right?

1033
00:42:59,806 --> 00:43:02,893
These helicopters rescue these cows as well.

1034
00:43:03,522 --> 00:43:06,400
(It's a flying cow.)

1035
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,960
(I always dreamed of flying. I always had that dream.)

1036
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:13,905
If I was in a different country, and I needed to get to a hospital.

1037
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:16,621
We have a service that allows me to be flown back to Switzerland.

1038
00:43:16,646 --> 00:43:19,099
There are no fees for that service as well.

1039
00:43:19,124 --> 00:43:22,511
I think most Swiss make use of this service.

1040
00:43:22,536 --> 00:43:24,631
However, we don't have a drama about that, unlike Japan.

1041
00:43:24,657 --> 00:43:29,288
There were many very popular drama set in an emergency room.

1042
00:43:30,063 --> 00:43:33,533
("ER", first aired in 1994)

1043
00:43:34,673 --> 00:43:38,131
("Grey's Anatomy", first aired in 2005)

1044
00:43:39,139 --> 00:43:43,012
("Code Black", first aired in 2015)

1045
00:43:44,313 --> 00:43:48,194
- I watched "Doctors" which stars Park Shin-hye three times. - Chicken fur.

1046
00:43:48,844 --> 00:43:50,484
It's "Doctors".

1047
00:43:50,526 --> 00:43:51,968
I'm watching it for the third time.

1048
00:43:51,993 --> 00:43:56,497
Did you start dreaming of becoming a doctor after watching a drama like that?

1049
00:43:56,586 --> 00:43:59,757
Doctors in Korea don't really have a lot of time to watch medical dramas.

1050
00:44:00,005 --> 00:44:01,588
They are really busy.

1051
00:44:01,613 --> 00:44:03,925
And the medical facts in the drama have been exaggerated.

1052
00:44:04,229 --> 00:44:06,579
Sometimes they are wrong as well. We can't empathize with it.

1053
00:44:06,579 --> 00:44:08,253
What was the most absurd scene that you saw?

1054
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:09,763
The most representative one.

1055
00:44:09,798 --> 00:44:11,407
On the drama, "Descendants of the Sun",

1056
00:44:11,432 --> 00:44:12,985
(They did the impossible in that drama.)

1057
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:14,769
- The one with Song Hye-kyo. - "Descendants of the Sun".

1058
00:44:14,794 --> 00:44:17,634
- In the scene where the patient had swallowed the diamonds. - Right.

1059
00:44:17,659 --> 00:44:21,945
Song Hye-kyo then shows him the X-ray with the diamonds on it.

1060
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:25,784
However, X-rays can't penetrate through diamonds, so it wouldn't show on the scan.

1061
00:44:25,784 --> 00:44:27,330
But you can see it like a white substance.

1062
00:44:27,834 --> 00:44:28,945
Are you sure he didn't eat stones?

1063
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:30,498
They are steel diamonds.

1064
00:44:30,523 --> 00:44:31,902
(Steel diamonds)

1065
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:33,101
You're saying they're fake.

1066
00:44:33,101 --> 00:44:35,996
There was a mistake like that on an Indian movie.

1067
00:44:36,021 --> 00:44:38,957
There was a scene where a doctor throws a heart like this.

1068
00:44:39,086 --> 00:44:40,894
The heart flies in the air like this.

1069
00:44:40,919 --> 00:44:44,502
Does the person receiving transplant, receive it like this?

1070
00:44:44,527 --> 00:44:48,051
In Pakistan, we have an emergency room system that we are proud of.

1071
00:44:48,275 --> 00:44:49,898
There's a person nicknamed, "Father Teresa".

1072
00:44:50,038 --> 00:44:54,094
He gathered the money he got from begging on the street and bought an ambulance.

1073
00:44:54,414 --> 00:44:57,054
We use that ambulance as an emergency room.

1074
00:44:57,318 --> 00:44:59,811
A lot of people liked that idea and donated more money.

1075
00:44:59,836 --> 00:45:03,579
We now have over 1,500 vehicles being used in that system.

1076
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:06,837
They also have a helicopter. They have started to operate internationally as well.

1077
00:45:06,863 --> 00:45:08,754
Is the emergency system responsive in Pakistan?

1078
00:45:08,779 --> 00:45:11,304
It's not well run, that's why people like him created a system like this.

1079
00:45:11,304 --> 00:45:14,220
- I think the emergency system in Pakistan is similar to Mexico. - Okay.

1080
00:45:14,452 --> 00:45:17,164
It's agonizingly slow. If you were to go to the emergency room in Mexico,

1081
00:45:17,284 --> 00:45:19,182
you have to be prepared to lose a day.

1082
00:45:19,747 --> 00:45:23,018
It's like that. They say emergency room, but it feels more like a waiting room.

1083
00:45:23,043 --> 00:45:25,503
People wait there for countless hours.

1084
00:45:25,735 --> 00:45:27,991
Some people go to the emergency room,

1085
00:45:28,114 --> 00:45:31,036
and then after a while their pain fades, so they leave.

1086
00:45:31,036 --> 00:45:33,246
- Time has healed them. - Yes, time has healed them.

1087
00:45:33,271 --> 00:45:35,906
- They go home. - If we're talking about slow, shouldn't we be talking about India?

1088
00:45:35,931 --> 00:45:39,357
The population of Delhi is 22 million.

1089
00:45:39,411 --> 00:45:41,754
But the number of emergency ambulances that the government has bought...

1090
00:45:41,779 --> 00:45:43,948
- is only 152. - Is that true?

1091
00:45:43,973 --> 00:45:47,235
So, each ambulance has to take care of 140,000 people.

1092
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:51,172
When you order a pizza, at most it takes 40 minutes.

1093
00:45:51,197 --> 00:45:53,197
However the emergency cars run by the government...

1094
00:45:53,227 --> 00:45:55,708
takes longer than 2 to 3 hours to arrive.

1095
00:45:55,733 --> 00:46:00,678
So in India, private hospitals and private ambulances really well developed.

1096
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,970
What I was most shocked about...

1097
00:46:02,522 --> 00:46:05,999
when I went overseas was how all the cars gave way to emergency vehicles.

1098
00:46:06,024 --> 00:46:07,052
I was so impressed.

1099
00:46:07,077 --> 00:46:08,444
When I asked about that,

1100
00:46:08,484 --> 00:46:11,779
- they said the fine for moving was huge in the US. - Yes, it is.

1101
00:46:11,804 --> 00:46:14,315
We move aside to the left and wait.

1102
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:17,214
- After they pass we go back on the road. - It's really impressive.

1103
00:46:17,302 --> 00:46:19,873
In Pakistan, when an emergency car turns on the siren,

1104
00:46:19,898 --> 00:46:22,252
the other cars also start honking as well.

1105
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:24,317
- Why? - "I'm late as well. Why are you being so loud?"

1106
00:46:24,343 --> 00:46:25,632
"I'm also busy, too."

1107
00:46:25,658 --> 00:46:28,286
- "I'm about to die as well." - "I have an emergency, too."

1108
00:46:28,451 --> 00:46:33,120
(The harmony of the siren and horns on the road)

1109
00:46:33,673 --> 00:46:35,535
Namgoong In, we heard that you brought us the top three things...

1110
00:46:35,535 --> 00:46:39,305
that the patients had said to you while you were working in the emergency room.

1111
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:42,737
Yes. The most common thing that patients say is,

1112
00:46:42,951 --> 00:46:45,382
"Why are you late?" They say that a lot.

1113
00:46:45,382 --> 00:46:46,858
- "I'm in pain." - Yes.

1114
00:46:46,883 --> 00:46:48,760
The second most common thing is whether it's covered by insurance.

1115
00:46:49,459 --> 00:46:50,859
They ask that a lot.

1116
00:46:50,884 --> 00:46:54,003
When I'm about to do the check-up,

1117
00:46:54,028 --> 00:46:56,314
they ask, "Do you know who I am?"

1118
00:46:56,339 --> 00:46:58,206
What do they say afterward?

1119
00:46:58,231 --> 00:47:00,825
They say something like, "I live in a luxurious apartment."

1120
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:03,451
- They say that. - You should have replied,

1121
00:47:03,476 --> 00:47:04,818
I live in a better area.

1122
00:47:04,818 --> 00:47:06,244
Whether you live in Tower Palace apartment,

1123
00:47:06,269 --> 00:47:08,269
- it's not that important to me. - Yes.

1124
00:47:08,429 --> 00:47:10,329
Do they really need to tell me that information?

1125
00:47:10,355 --> 00:47:12,348
They feel like you'll be more thorough if they tell that.

1126
00:47:12,373 --> 00:47:14,364
- They do think that way. - Yes, they do.

1127
00:47:14,389 --> 00:47:16,648
Next time, tell them where you live as well.

1128
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:18,862
- Tell them where you live. - I live in Haebangchon District.

1129
00:47:19,467 --> 00:47:21,467
"I live in Haebangchon District."

1130
00:47:21,507 --> 00:47:23,847
We'll now turn our attention to medical techniques.

1131
00:47:23,872 --> 00:47:25,780
Tell us what your country is good at.

1132
00:47:25,805 --> 00:47:28,076
In Japan because of our aging society,

1133
00:47:28,102 --> 00:47:31,116
our care of the elderly is well developed.

1134
00:47:31,141 --> 00:47:33,756
That's why the nursing homes,

1135
00:47:33,781 --> 00:47:36,036
have bought lots of robotic nurses.

1136
00:47:36,061 --> 00:47:38,804
- They give the patients baths. - They give them baths,

1137
00:47:38,829 --> 00:47:40,601
and we also have a robot that cleans up as well.

1138
00:47:40,857 --> 00:47:42,633
We also have a robot suit.

1139
00:47:42,658 --> 00:47:43,977
- A robot suit? - Yes.

1140
00:47:44,002 --> 00:47:47,242
There are a lot of seniors that are lying down.

1141
00:47:47,482 --> 00:47:50,307
But you need a lot of strength to be able to do that.

1142
00:47:50,333 --> 00:47:53,053
- It's very hard. - This suit is designed to help you with that.

1143
00:47:53,089 --> 00:47:55,057
- Wow. - So it helps you to lift people up.

1144
00:47:55,057 --> 00:47:57,363
- You can lift up people easily. - It's like something from a movie.

1145
00:47:57,391 --> 00:47:58,936
- You can lift people up easily. - "Iron Man".

1146
00:47:58,962 --> 00:48:03,139
I think the US has the best surgical techniques in the world.

1147
00:48:03,207 --> 00:48:07,055
We are also a country that develops new drugs very fast.

1148
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:10,952
We have a lot of drug companies. We also have a federal agency called the FDA.

1149
00:48:10,977 --> 00:48:14,704
The FDA meticulously looks at all the new drugs that are being produced.

1150
00:48:14,729 --> 00:48:17,166
It's an agency that checks all this.

1151
00:48:17,191 --> 00:48:19,127
Thanks to this, we are known as a country...

1152
00:48:19,153 --> 00:48:21,798
that develops new drugs and medicines very quickly.

1153
00:48:21,827 --> 00:48:23,670
We use a lot of drugs as well,

1154
00:48:23,695 --> 00:48:27,029
- so our dependency is a little bit higher. - It's higher, right?

1155
00:48:27,085 --> 00:48:28,317
That's a regrettable fact.

1156
00:48:28,342 --> 00:48:32,733
I think China has the best oriental medicine in the world.

1157
00:48:33,056 --> 00:48:34,584
We have this thought in China,

1158
00:48:34,772 --> 00:48:38,143
"Western medicine treats only what you can see from the patient."

1159
00:48:38,169 --> 00:48:41,440
"Chinese medicine treats what's inside him as well." We say that.

1160
00:48:41,465 --> 00:48:43,445
Also, these days...

1161
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:47,409
the most popular form of treatment for sports athletes is cupping.

1162
00:48:47,525 --> 00:48:50,431
The US swimmer, Michael Phelps likes this as well.

1163
00:48:50,457 --> 00:48:51,969
- Can you see the cupping marks on his back? - Yes.

1164
00:48:51,994 --> 00:48:55,278
- Yes, when he swims, you could see the marks. - Right. I saw those.

1165
00:48:56,154 --> 00:48:57,845
If you're talking about traditional medicines,

1166
00:48:57,871 --> 00:49:00,329
Ayurvedic medicine from India is very famous, right?

1167
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:02,982
- In India, we have our ways to heal asthma. - Asthma?

1168
00:49:03,007 --> 00:49:04,448
Yes, asthma.

1169
00:49:04,473 --> 00:49:08,025
We put the medicine into the mouth of a fish that looks like an anchovy.

1170
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,632
We then tell the patient to swallow it.

1171
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:11,194
You tell them to swallow the fish?

1172
00:49:11,219 --> 00:49:14,422
We put the medicine into the fish's mouth.

1173
00:49:14,447 --> 00:49:16,335
We put it into the mouth like this.

1174
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,465
- "Eat it." - It's only for two days.

1175
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:21,576
You can only get this medicine for two days in the middle of June.

1176
00:49:21,601 --> 00:49:25,110
- I don't know if it comes in capsule form, but... - The fish takes the medicine,

1177
00:49:25,512 --> 00:49:26,865
"Why are they looking at me?"

1178
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:28,650
It's literally a doctor fish.

1179
00:49:28,675 --> 00:49:30,033
It's literally "Doctor Strange".

1180
00:49:30,058 --> 00:49:31,960
In Mexico, this was a long time ago,

1181
00:49:31,985 --> 00:49:34,064
I'm talking about during the Aztec civilization,

1182
00:49:34,089 --> 00:49:36,784
- they had folk remedies. - Aztec civilization.

1183
00:49:36,809 --> 00:49:38,609
- Folk remedies. - They had developed folk remedies back then.

1184
00:49:38,635 --> 00:49:40,852
We have a tree that represents this called the Eucalyptus globulus.

1185
00:49:40,877 --> 00:49:42,343
- Let's say you had a blocked nose. - Right.

1186
00:49:42,368 --> 00:49:44,978
You could boil the leaves from the tree in hot water,

1187
00:49:45,003 --> 00:49:48,897
and the smell from the boiling leaves is very effective.

1188
00:49:48,922 --> 00:49:51,286
There are people who can't sleep at night, right?

1189
00:49:51,331 --> 00:49:52,717
- Insomnia. - Insomnia.

1190
00:49:52,743 --> 00:49:54,097
You know banana leaves, right?

1191
00:49:54,122 --> 00:49:56,872
You can just cut them up and boil them in hot water.

1192
00:49:57,352 --> 00:49:59,688
If you drink the boiled soup, it'll help you to sleep.

1193
00:49:59,713 --> 00:50:01,184
- Really? - Yes, you just need to drink it.

1194
00:50:01,209 --> 00:50:03,353
- I tried it and I fell asleep instantly. - How was it?

1195
00:50:03,378 --> 00:50:04,818
Isn't it because of pesticides?

1196
00:50:05,069 --> 00:50:07,538
- No. - You might have fainted because of it.

1197
00:50:07,563 --> 00:50:09,228
That happens quite often.

1198
00:50:09,253 --> 00:50:11,962
It's also used by some Koreans, too.

1199
00:50:11,987 --> 00:50:15,602
Switzerland has a long history of watch and clock making.

1200
00:50:15,602 --> 00:50:18,935
That means it's highly capable of building other precision instruments as well.

1201
00:50:19,012 --> 00:50:21,350
A Swiss company which used to produce watch components...

1202
00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:23,849
happened to make bone implant materials.

1203
00:50:23,874 --> 00:50:25,874
They kept developing their technology,

1204
00:50:25,899 --> 00:50:29,137
and expanded to dental implants.

1205
00:50:29,415 --> 00:50:32,695
A number of other companies share similar histories.

1206
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:36,849
Switzerland is well known for its advanced medical machinery industry.

1207
00:50:37,466 --> 00:50:41,208
There's a company called Olympus in Japan, famous for its digital cameras.

1208
00:50:41,233 --> 00:50:45,234
Actually 73 percent of their sales came from medical instruments.

1209
00:50:45,259 --> 00:50:47,850
There's no match to the company in the endoscope market.

1210
00:50:47,875 --> 00:50:49,474
- Endoscope. - Yes, endoscope.

1211
00:50:49,499 --> 00:50:50,582
Lenses are important.

1212
00:50:50,582 --> 00:50:52,626
Their products are widely used in Korea as well.

1213
00:50:53,674 --> 00:50:56,870
I was surprised that a camera company makes such precision instrument.

1214
00:50:57,083 --> 00:50:58,243
- Are they good? - Yes.

1215
00:50:58,725 --> 00:51:01,581
As I mentioned earlier, Pakistan...

1216
00:51:01,813 --> 00:51:04,054
- is known for scalpel production. - Scalpel.

1217
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:06,974
- Knife, too. - You said we should buy a knife if we travel to Pakistan.

1218
00:51:07,861 --> 00:51:09,422
Scalpel and scissors.

1219
00:51:09,422 --> 00:51:11,322
Pins, too. We are so good at producing them.

1220
00:51:11,322 --> 00:51:14,884
Internationally, German-made products are more widely used.

1221
00:51:14,909 --> 00:51:16,789
But Pakistani products are also good...

1222
00:51:16,814 --> 00:51:19,713
and much cheaper. Hence it has strong price competitiveness.

1223
00:51:19,738 --> 00:51:21,198
Have you ever...

1224
00:51:21,822 --> 00:51:23,670
used Pakistani-made scalpel?

1225
00:51:23,695 --> 00:51:25,422
I use whatever nurses give me.

1226
00:51:26,567 --> 00:51:28,758
- Look at them closely. They could be made in Pakistan. - Okay.

1227
00:51:28,783 --> 00:51:30,802
- I'm sure they are. - I'll check it out.

1228
00:51:30,948 --> 00:51:33,951
- Why are you so sure? - Isn't it your first time to meet him?

1229
00:51:34,512 --> 00:51:36,147
(You'll see the difference.)

1230
00:51:36,172 --> 00:51:38,250
Countries of representatives here must have...

1231
00:51:38,275 --> 00:51:41,927
great doctors and nurses who touched people's heart with their wonderful sacrifice and service.

1232
00:51:41,952 --> 00:51:44,043
- We have Heo Jun in Korea. - Right.

1233
00:51:44,068 --> 00:51:45,569
Who else in your country?

1234
00:51:46,034 --> 00:51:47,828
We have Albert Schweitzer.

1235
00:51:47,853 --> 00:51:49,320
- Dr. Schweitzer. - Schweitzer.

1236
00:51:49,345 --> 00:51:52,410
He visited African so often throughout his life...

1237
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:56,215
and built hospitals there. Also he built hospitals in France.

1238
00:51:56,487 --> 00:51:58,605
He's well known for his achievements.

1239
00:51:58,605 --> 00:51:59,624
(I see.)

1240
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:02,422
He was born with a German nationality.

1241
00:52:02,726 --> 00:52:06,414
But he thought he was a French.

1242
00:52:06,694 --> 00:52:09,807
He wrote many books in French.

1243
00:52:09,832 --> 00:52:13,813
But Schweitzer is not that famous in France.

1244
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:16,355
Isn't he famous across the world?

1245
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:18,003
- I haven' heard of him. - You haven't?

1246
00:52:18,028 --> 00:52:19,154
Me, either.

1247
00:52:19,179 --> 00:52:21,314
We all read his story as a kid.

1248
00:52:21,339 --> 00:52:23,134
He's not famous in some countries?

1249
00:52:23,134 --> 00:52:25,401
- Not known in Mexico. - Same goes with the US.

1250
00:52:25,426 --> 00:52:27,233
- What about Japan? - Italians don't know him.

1251
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:29,044
- Not in detail. - Haven't heard of him.

1252
00:52:29,069 --> 00:52:31,268
In Korea, he's a very well-known figure.

1253
00:52:31,268 --> 00:52:33,651
In Korea, he's as famous as Nightingale.

1254
00:52:33,676 --> 00:52:36,223
They are the two most prominent figures in the medical field.

1255
00:52:36,248 --> 00:52:37,946
- Can't believe it. - Goodness.

1256
00:52:37,971 --> 00:52:40,170
We have Nightingale.

1257
00:52:40,894 --> 00:52:44,172
- What? - It seems you lost your confidence all of a sudden, don't you?

1258
00:52:44,405 --> 00:52:47,981
Florence Nightingale is very famous, right?

1259
00:52:48,006 --> 00:52:50,797
She was a daughter of a noble English man,

1260
00:52:51,023 --> 00:52:52,795
but was born in Firenze, Italy.

1261
00:52:52,897 --> 00:52:54,978
- That's why... - Her birthplace is Italy.

1262
00:52:55,233 --> 00:52:56,585
- Only the birthplace. - No.

1263
00:52:56,610 --> 00:52:58,528
Her family lived in Italy.

1264
00:52:58,553 --> 00:53:02,137
- I see. - That's why her name is Florence, which means Firenze.

1265
00:53:02,377 --> 00:53:05,665
During the Crimean War, she volunteered as a nurse.

1266
00:53:05,825 --> 00:53:09,361
She introduced a totally new way of field hospital management.

1267
00:53:09,808 --> 00:53:14,060
She contributed to lowering the death rate of patients from 42 to 2 percent.

1268
00:53:14,094 --> 00:53:15,398
Thanks to her management.

1269
00:53:15,423 --> 00:53:19,330
Many people think she's the founder of modern nursing science.

1270
00:53:20,054 --> 00:53:23,230
Another famous figure in Italy is Maria Montessori.

1271
00:53:23,593 --> 00:53:25,290
- Montessori. - I know.

1272
00:53:25,331 --> 00:53:29,289
Maria Montessori was the first female student in the medical college in Italy.

1273
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:31,820
At that time, mentally challenged children were...

1274
00:53:31,892 --> 00:53:34,628
treated like animals. Seeing that,

1275
00:53:34,653 --> 00:53:37,259
she started to study children.

1276
00:53:37,591 --> 00:53:39,530
She started the famous Montessori education.

1277
00:53:39,562 --> 00:53:42,063
There were many "Montessori" schools in Korea when I was young.

1278
00:53:42,088 --> 00:53:45,875
- Yes, like piano schools. - It still exists in the middle of Gangham area.

1279
00:53:45,875 --> 00:53:48,035
I thought it's related to sound, like sound of piano.

1280
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:49,699
I had a similar question myself.

1281
00:53:49,746 --> 00:53:51,598
What does "ssori" mean?

1282
00:53:51,623 --> 00:53:53,853
I've never heard of it before.

1283
00:53:53,878 --> 00:53:55,901
But the private piano school was very popular.

1284
00:53:55,926 --> 00:53:58,042
I thought it's just the name of the school.

1285
00:53:58,042 --> 00:54:00,644
Montessori schools are all over the world.

1286
00:54:00,735 --> 00:54:02,623
Instead of teaching children,

1287
00:54:02,879 --> 00:54:06,496
they give children place and freedom to play around.

1288
00:54:06,521 --> 00:54:08,838
- I see. - It's a good way of education.

1289
00:54:08,863 --> 00:54:12,511
There's is a doctor whom all American would recognize.

1290
00:54:12,984 --> 00:54:15,860
- He's an Indian-American. He's name is Sanjay Gupta. - I know.

1291
00:54:15,885 --> 00:54:17,885
- Sanjay Gupta... - Is handsome, isn't he?

1292
00:54:17,910 --> 00:54:22,005
was named one of the sexiest men in the US.

1293
00:54:22,261 --> 00:54:23,660
His name is Gupta.

1294
00:54:23,685 --> 00:54:26,313
Most of shows related to medical science...

1295
00:54:26,338 --> 00:54:29,488
invite him as a guest and he was hugely popular.

1296
00:54:29,726 --> 00:54:32,403
(He became even more famous after turning down Obama's offer for a ministerial position.)

1297
00:54:32,428 --> 00:54:34,428
Isn't House M.D. the most famous doctor?

1298
00:54:34,573 --> 00:54:37,453
In the real world, Sanjay Gupta is the most famous doctor.

1299
00:54:37,478 --> 00:54:39,232
Maybe not if TV characters are counted.

1300
00:54:39,257 --> 00:54:41,285
Have you seen those dramas like "House M.D."?

1301
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:42,554
I saw "House M.D."

1302
00:54:42,571 --> 00:54:43,761
What do you think of it?

1303
00:54:43,761 --> 00:54:46,700
Though it covers rare medical cases, its episodes are all based on...

1304
00:54:46,725 --> 00:54:48,919
cases that are likely to take place.

1305
00:54:48,944 --> 00:54:50,657
So I had much fun watching it.

1306
00:54:50,657 --> 00:54:51,935
- It's realistic. - Yes.

1307
00:54:51,935 --> 00:54:54,982
I have many friends who are doctors.

1308
00:54:55,007 --> 00:54:58,304
Many of them told me they watched the drama to study.

1309
00:54:59,064 --> 00:55:02,941
Who's the doctor that is locally respected among Korean doctors?

1310
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:07,137
In Korea, there's a doctor called Lee Guk-jong.

1311
00:55:07,177 --> 00:55:09,634
He treated Captain Seok who participated in...

1312
00:55:09,659 --> 00:55:12,427
the Operation Dawn of Gulf of Aden.

1313
00:55:12,452 --> 00:55:16,896
That's how he was known to the public. He's a doctor of Trauma Surgery Department at Ajou University.

1314
00:55:16,921 --> 00:55:19,094
After he saved Captain Seok's life,

1315
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:23,434
Dr. Lee emphasized the necessity to build trauma centers in Korea.

1316
00:55:23,459 --> 00:55:26,231
He's such a hard-working doctor.

1317
00:55:26,443 --> 00:55:30,359
Before he came into the spotlight, trauma treatment had relied on rule of thumb.

1318
00:55:30,384 --> 00:55:33,595
Since then, government subsidies were offered and trauma centers were built.

1319
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:37,374
He raised public awareness on trauma treatment.

1320
00:55:37,399 --> 00:55:40,471
Everybody would want to see a famous doctor...

1321
00:55:40,496 --> 00:55:42,698
when he or she gets ill.

1322
00:55:42,746 --> 00:55:47,125
But in reality, you have to wait for long see those doctors.

1323
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:49,359
You can see them only after waiting several months.

1324
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:51,816
If you need a surgery, will you...

1325
00:55:52,047 --> 00:55:55,376
wait for six months to get a surgery from a famous doctor?

1326
00:55:55,466 --> 00:55:59,434
Or will you go to a doctor who can do the surgery right away?

1327
00:55:59,570 --> 00:56:02,122
Those who are willing to wait, please raise your hands in 1,2,3.

1328
00:56:03,010 --> 00:56:05,138
- Will you wait for six months? - If it's not that serious.

1329
00:56:05,163 --> 00:56:06,255
- If I'm not sick. - Right.

1330
00:56:06,255 --> 00:56:07,984
If I'm not going to die any time soon.

1331
00:56:08,009 --> 00:56:09,473
What if you're so sick?

1332
00:56:09,474 --> 00:56:10,646
But after six months...

1333
00:56:10,671 --> 00:56:14,659
All right. Let's hear out from the doctor first. What will you do in this case?

1334
00:56:14,684 --> 00:56:16,446
As I'm a doctor in Korea myself,

1335
00:56:16,446 --> 00:56:18,516
I trust my colleague doctors and the medical system here.

1336
00:56:18,548 --> 00:56:20,830
- I'll go with the latter. - It's because you're not sick.

1337
00:56:20,855 --> 00:56:22,439
No. I'll take my surgery in no time.

1338
00:56:22,856 --> 00:56:24,089
I'm so sure.

1339
00:56:24,114 --> 00:56:25,673
Even though the doctor...

1340
00:56:25,697 --> 00:56:28,887
who will operate is not famous, that doesn't mean he's a poor doctor.

1341
00:56:28,912 --> 00:56:30,743
While waiting for six months,

1342
00:56:30,768 --> 00:56:33,839
- my conditions will become worse. - It will get worse.

1343
00:56:33,864 --> 00:56:35,864
But it depends on what the disease is.

1344
00:56:35,919 --> 00:56:38,212
You might get better while waiting.

1345
00:56:38,578 --> 00:56:40,593
- No. - Ridiculous.

1346
00:56:40,618 --> 00:56:42,240
It's because...

1347
00:56:42,265 --> 00:56:45,265
there are some fraudulent doctors when it comes to surgery.

1348
00:56:45,503 --> 00:56:47,375
Personally, I think...

1349
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,325
You talked about anchovy earlier.

1350
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:51,926
Isn't it belated to talk about medical schemes?

1351
00:56:51,951 --> 00:56:55,805
- Wasn't the anchovy story a fraud? - No, it's a different story.

1352
00:56:55,805 --> 00:56:57,053
An anchovy fraud.

1353
00:56:57,078 --> 00:57:00,221
It's not always good to rush things for the patient.

1354
00:57:00,428 --> 00:57:02,125
That's what really happened in India.

1355
00:57:02,197 --> 00:57:04,477
One slightly sprained his ankle.

1356
00:57:04,502 --> 00:57:07,692
But just giving him a prescription doesn't make much money. So the doctor...

1357
00:57:07,884 --> 00:57:09,388
said that the patient needed a surgery.

1358
00:57:09,413 --> 00:57:12,101
Hasty surgery may lead to a medical accident.

1359
00:57:12,126 --> 00:57:14,813
Having a surgery requires a careful consideration.

1360
00:57:14,838 --> 00:57:16,341
You shouldn't hurry about it.

1361
00:57:16,366 --> 00:57:19,065
I'd be waiting only if my condition allows.

1362
00:57:19,090 --> 00:57:22,540
It's not pizza delivery. Rushing your decision will do no good.

1363
00:57:22,542 --> 00:57:24,805
There's a saying you'll get only worse if you wait.

1364
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:26,013
- Right. - Yes.

1365
00:57:26,038 --> 00:57:27,429
That's what moms say.

1366
00:57:27,454 --> 00:57:29,386
- However... - Is that so?

1367
00:57:29,411 --> 00:57:30,803
it sounds reasonable to me.

1368
00:57:30,828 --> 00:57:33,756
In China, the level of doctors varies a lot.

1369
00:57:34,043 --> 00:57:35,507
Even if we have to wake up early...

1370
00:57:35,532 --> 00:57:38,587
and wait in lines, we should receive a surgery from a good doctor.

1371
00:57:38,723 --> 00:57:39,891
It's less risky.

1372
00:57:39,916 --> 00:57:42,955
- It's different in different countries. - Sure.

1373
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:45,760
I underwent a surgery myself when I had appendicitis.

1374
00:57:45,785 --> 00:57:47,918
- Appendicitis. - Yes, when I had that operation,

1375
00:57:47,943 --> 00:57:50,026
there were two doctors in the hospital.

1376
00:57:50,051 --> 00:57:52,603
One said it's needed to cut out much of my appendix.

1377
00:57:52,628 --> 00:57:54,899
The other said small cutout would be enough.

1378
00:57:54,924 --> 00:57:56,790
I got a surgery from the first doctor.

1379
00:57:56,815 --> 00:57:58,578
There's been no problem yet.

1380
00:57:58,578 --> 00:58:01,358
- Wouldn't it be better to make a small cutout? - But I had to wait.

1381
00:58:01,383 --> 00:58:04,141
If it's a disease with which you can wait for six months,

1382
00:58:04,166 --> 00:58:06,123
it means your condition is really bad.

1383
00:58:06,148 --> 00:58:09,139
- Moreover, you need to undergo a surgery. - Right.

1384
00:58:09,139 --> 00:58:11,503
You might die if you wait for six months.

1385
00:58:11,528 --> 00:58:13,489
Becoming a doctor is not easy.

1386
00:58:13,514 --> 00:58:15,300
Every doctor is heavily educated for a long time.

1387
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:20,115
- I believe all doctors are qualified enough to give us an operation. - We should believe them.

1388
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:22,399
If it's needed to get a surgery,

1389
00:58:22,663 --> 00:58:25,103
I won't wait for six months. I'd get one right away.

1390
00:58:25,128 --> 00:58:28,855
But there must be a reason for his fame.

1391
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,503
I learned a lesson. Going to a famous doctor...

1392
00:58:31,803 --> 00:58:34,483
wouldn't always guarantee 100 percent recovery.

1393
00:58:34,687 --> 00:58:36,824
But it is less likely to get worse.

1394
00:58:36,824 --> 00:58:38,472
Yes, we feel safer.

1395
00:58:38,497 --> 00:58:42,587
- What if I can't stand the pain for another six months? - Then you should get a surgery.

1396
00:58:42,612 --> 00:58:44,711
- As soon as possible. - Yes.

1397
00:58:44,765 --> 00:58:47,535
- Personally I believe... - It depends on.

1398
00:58:47,535 --> 00:58:50,503
It might be different depending on what your disease is.

1399
00:58:50,528 --> 00:58:52,272
Case by case.

1400
00:58:52,442 --> 00:58:53,634
Okay.

1401
00:58:53,659 --> 00:58:56,269
Don't be sick and let's move on to our next topic.

1402
00:58:56,294 --> 00:58:59,463
Tell us about disease which was found for the first time in your country.

1403
00:58:59,837 --> 00:59:02,063
We found Lou Gehric disease.

1404
00:59:02,063 --> 00:59:05,574
- Lou Gehric disease. - It's the name of a Yankees player.

1405
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:08,396
He had the disease and it was named after him.

1406
00:59:08,793 --> 00:59:10,125
(Steven Hawking has the disease.)

1407
00:59:10,451 --> 00:59:12,038
Also, Noro virus...

1408
00:59:12,593 --> 00:59:14,408
was first found in the US.

1409
00:59:14,610 --> 00:59:17,287
It was named in the States...

1410
00:59:17,312 --> 00:59:20,487
but Japanese people complained about the name.

1411
00:59:20,512 --> 00:59:22,512
Because the word "Noro"...

1412
00:59:22,537 --> 00:59:24,533
is a very common family name in Japan.

1413
00:59:24,616 --> 00:59:26,501
- Yes. - They didn't like the name.

1414
00:59:26,526 --> 00:59:29,557
- We changed the name into "Norwalk" virus. - Changed the name?

1415
00:59:29,582 --> 00:59:31,429
But even after we changed its name,

1416
00:59:31,589 --> 00:59:34,442
it's still commonly called Noro virus.

1417
00:59:34,467 --> 00:59:36,722
It's officially changed but nothing really has changed.

1418
00:59:36,747 --> 00:59:38,388
- Right. - Just the official name.

1419
00:59:38,413 --> 00:59:39,948
This disease is also well-known in Korea.

1420
00:59:39,973 --> 00:59:42,406
- It's called Itai-itai disease. - It means "It hurts."

1421
00:59:42,431 --> 00:59:45,109
This disease was caused by...

1422
00:59:45,109 --> 00:59:47,138
chronic cadmium poisoning.

1423
00:59:47,665 --> 00:59:50,218
In Korean, "itai-itai" means...

1424
00:59:50,243 --> 00:59:52,220
"It hurts, it hurts."

1425
00:59:52,322 --> 00:59:55,320
Patients of the disease kept saying that when they passed away.

1426
00:59:55,345 --> 00:59:57,670
- Seeing that, people named the disease "itai-itai". - It's scary.

1427
00:59:57,805 --> 01:00:01,925
What's attracting people's attention again is Moyamoya disease.

1428
01:00:01,955 --> 01:00:03,412
What is Moyamoya disease?

1429
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:06,265
It means "puff of smoke" in Japanese, right?

1430
01:00:06,281 --> 01:00:09,898
It is a disease in which certain arteries in the brain are constricted.

1431
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:13,399
When you scan the brain after injecting contrast media,

1432
01:00:13,399 --> 01:00:15,849
the image will look like a puff of smoke.

1433
01:00:15,873 --> 01:00:19,025
It gives you a horrible headache. It's a painful disease.

1434
01:00:19,145 --> 01:00:22,785
There's a disease that was first discovered in Korea.

1435
01:00:23,066 --> 01:00:26,226
When you were young, people told you not to sit on the grass, right?

1436
01:00:26,266 --> 01:00:28,562
That's because of epidemic hemorrhagic fever.

1437
01:00:28,610 --> 01:00:30,977
It's a febrile virus that rodents carry.

1438
01:00:31,274 --> 01:00:33,098
The first person who discovered the virus was Korean.

1439
01:00:33,553 --> 01:00:36,124
It was discovered at Hantan River.

1440
01:00:36,555 --> 01:00:38,284
So the virus is called Hantan Virus.

1441
01:00:38,309 --> 01:00:41,602
- I see. - At first, it was called Korean hemorrhagic fever.

1442
01:00:41,643 --> 01:00:43,612
Now it's called epidemic hemorrhagic fever.

1443
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:45,880
The disease still exists in Korea.

1444
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:48,366
In 1907, a famous disease...

1445
01:00:48,391 --> 01:00:52,303
- called Alzheimer's disease was first discovered in Germany. - I see.

1446
01:00:52,334 --> 01:00:54,293
A German psychiatrist called...

1447
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:56,836
Dr. Alois Alzheimer first discovered the disease.

1448
01:00:56,876 --> 01:00:58,748
He was the first one to discover the disease.

1449
01:00:59,196 --> 01:01:01,205
(President Ronald Reagan also died from Alzheimer's disease.)

1450
01:01:01,243 --> 01:01:04,140
In 2009, there was an outbreak of a new strain of influenza.

1451
01:01:04,165 --> 01:01:06,012
(Swine flu has got the whole world in a panic.)

1452
01:01:06,028 --> 01:01:08,343
- It was first spread from Mexico. - That's right.

1453
01:01:08,368 --> 01:01:12,055
In 2009, the virus was first found at a hog farm in Mexico.

1454
01:01:12,366 --> 01:01:16,271
Then an American was infected and went back to the States.

1455
01:01:16,311 --> 01:01:18,311
So the virus spread around the world.

1456
01:01:18,663 --> 01:01:21,158
The situation got really bad in Mexico.

1457
01:01:21,183 --> 01:01:23,455
Mexicans don't normally wear masks.

1458
01:01:23,726 --> 01:01:25,694
They only wear it when they're really sick.

1459
01:01:25,718 --> 01:01:28,412
- It's also very hot. - But everyone was wearing a mask back then.

1460
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:31,215
People didn't leave their house, either.

1461
01:01:31,515 --> 01:01:33,395
A lot of people died from the virus.

1462
01:01:33,419 --> 01:01:35,419
To prevent swine flu from spreading,

1463
01:01:36,027 --> 01:01:38,179
a Swiss drug company called Roche...

1464
01:01:38,539 --> 01:01:40,744
- made Tamiflu. - I remember that.

1465
01:01:40,769 --> 01:01:42,699
- It was a Swiss medicine. - It was hard to get the drugs back then.

1466
01:01:42,731 --> 01:01:46,531
The demand of the drug had skyrocketed, so they increased the price.

1467
01:01:47,075 --> 01:01:48,784
However, many had said that...

1468
01:01:48,835 --> 01:01:51,892
the effect of Tamiflu was minimal.

1469
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:53,390
Even a rumor was spread.

1470
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:56,963
People said Roche made the swine flu virus...

1471
01:01:56,998 --> 01:01:58,796
- in order to sell their drugs. - To sell their drugs?

1472
01:01:59,244 --> 01:02:00,868
I took Tamiflu in 2009.

1473
01:02:00,892 --> 01:02:02,092
Did you recover after taking the drug?

1474
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:04,212
- But I don't know... - Was it tasty?

1475
01:02:04,246 --> 01:02:06,285
whether I recovered after taking the pills or taking a rest.

1476
01:02:06,677 --> 01:02:09,005
- It makes you wonder. - Yes, that's what I thought.

1477
01:02:09,030 --> 01:02:11,405
In Korea, people say...

1478
01:02:11,429 --> 01:02:14,652
it takes 14 days to recover from a cold and 2 weeks if you go to a hospital.

1479
01:02:14,677 --> 01:02:16,689
- Right. - We're talking about Tamiflu.

1480
01:02:16,745 --> 01:02:18,182
Lets' talk about new drugs of each country.

1481
01:02:18,468 --> 01:02:22,442
In 1892, a German man called Felix Hoffmann...

1482
01:02:22,575 --> 01:02:25,293
- developed aspirin. - I see.

1483
01:02:25,964 --> 01:02:27,652
When he was 23,

1484
01:02:27,677 --> 01:02:30,852
- his father was suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. - Rheumatoid arthritis.

1485
01:02:31,085 --> 01:02:34,460
He wanted to treat his father's disease. That's how he developed the medicine.

1486
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:37,053
When he first gave aspirin to his father,

1487
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:41,069
his father told him he was able to sleep comfortably...

1488
01:02:41,601 --> 01:02:43,845
- without any pain. - I see.

1489
01:02:43,977 --> 01:02:45,293
It was developed, thanks to his dutifulness.

1490
01:02:45,834 --> 01:02:49,007
- You all know about Pasteur, right? - Yes.

1491
01:02:49,007 --> 01:02:50,667
- Their milk is delicious. - Yes.

1492
01:02:50,707 --> 01:02:53,739
He discovered microbial fermentation.

1493
01:02:53,812 --> 01:02:56,660
He also developed the vaccination for chicken cholera...

1494
01:02:56,708 --> 01:02:59,363
- and rabies as well. - I see.

1495
01:03:00,235 --> 01:03:02,844
He did his research in Lille.

1496
01:03:02,869 --> 01:03:05,812
He had worked with one of my ancestors.

1497
01:03:05,835 --> 01:03:09,835
- Who was it? - My grand father's grand father's brother.

1498
01:03:10,088 --> 01:03:11,848
- They worked together. - With Pasteur?

1499
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:13,927
It could've become Aurélien's milk then.

1500
01:03:14,229 --> 01:03:15,477
You're right.

1501
01:03:16,053 --> 01:03:18,733
An important medicine was developed in America.

1502
01:03:18,781 --> 01:03:20,453
The story is quite fascinating.

1503
01:03:20,485 --> 01:03:23,389
It's fascinating. It's the story about Viagra.

1504
01:03:23,389 --> 01:03:25,389
Actually, Viagra was first developed...

1505
01:03:25,437 --> 01:03:28,478
- to treat heart disease. - It was developed to treat angina pectoris.

1506
01:03:28,578 --> 01:03:30,526
Yes. People started to take the pills...

1507
01:03:30,906 --> 01:03:33,846
and another effect of the medicine was later discovered.

1508
01:03:34,382 --> 01:03:37,663
- So they... - I'm sure they were really surprised.

1509
01:03:38,364 --> 01:03:39,857
They took the pills to treat heart disease, and...

1510
01:03:42,288 --> 01:03:43,945
How strong has my heart become?

1511
01:03:45,009 --> 01:03:46,096
It's...

1512
01:03:46,128 --> 01:03:48,280
The patient was lying on the bed,

1513
01:03:49,272 --> 01:03:51,213
and the doctor was curious what was going on.

1514
01:03:51,756 --> 01:03:54,381
- The doctor was surprised. - The doctor was surprised to see that.

1515
01:03:54,406 --> 01:03:55,645
That's right.

1516
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:58,246
The principle is the same. The drug dilates blood vessels.

1517
01:03:58,573 --> 01:04:01,382
- When blood vessels are dilated, the flow of blood is increased. - Yes.

1518
01:04:01,414 --> 01:04:03,229
It's used to treat heart disease as well.

1519
01:04:03,422 --> 01:04:04,942
It's also used for mountain sickness.

1520
01:04:04,982 --> 01:04:08,358
- Mountain sickness? - The blood vessels get dilated, so is eases headaches.

1521
01:04:08,358 --> 01:04:11,259
When people find out that you have Viagra,

1522
01:04:11,698 --> 01:04:13,522
you can tell them you have mountain sickness.

1523
01:04:13,726 --> 01:04:15,606
People ask for a prescription, saying they're going to mountains.

1524
01:04:15,631 --> 01:04:18,088
Well... They get a prescription for Viagra.

1525
01:04:18,113 --> 01:04:20,929
- They get a prescription and use it for another purpose. - They say...

1526
01:04:21,241 --> 01:04:23,817
- they're going to climb a high mountain. - They say they're going to Nepal.

1527
01:04:23,849 --> 01:04:25,497
Don't they go to Nepal too often?

1528
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:29,062
You know I'm going to Nepal.

1529
01:04:30,029 --> 01:04:31,413
I'm so jealous.

1530
01:04:32,787 --> 01:04:33,963
I'm going to Nepal.

1531
01:04:35,690 --> 01:04:39,491
Sometimes, a medical malpractice can lead to a medical dispute in Korea.

1532
01:04:39,539 --> 01:04:41,529
Is there a particular malpractice that you felt sad about?

1533
01:04:41,561 --> 01:04:45,195
Of course it's Shin Hae-chul's case.

1534
01:04:45,772 --> 01:04:48,724
(Shin Hae-chul's death shocked everyone. What happened for the past 10 days?)

1535
01:04:48,739 --> 01:04:52,234
Doctors tend to take side with other doctors when medical accidents happen.

1536
01:04:52,267 --> 01:04:54,188
But in Shin Hae-chul's case,

1537
01:04:54,204 --> 01:04:59,019
he was fine and was able to speak, then he died suddenly due to complications.

1538
01:04:59,044 --> 01:05:03,241
So doctors also think that he died from a medical malpractice.

1539
01:05:03,266 --> 01:05:06,239
- He was sentenced two years in prison. - It's not a final judgment,

1540
01:05:06,254 --> 01:05:08,879
- but he was sentenced two years in prison. - Right.

1541
01:05:08,903 --> 01:05:11,494
- There were similar incidents in the States. - In case of America,

1542
01:05:11,510 --> 01:05:14,110
Michael Jackson died in 2009.

1543
01:05:14,756 --> 01:05:16,756
The cause of his death was...

1544
01:05:16,963 --> 01:05:20,707
his family doctor. He was Michael Jackson's private doctor.

1545
01:05:20,707 --> 01:05:23,853
Michael Jackson had been suffering from a lot of stress and insomnia.

1546
01:05:23,954 --> 01:05:26,107
So he asked his doctor...

1547
01:05:26,107 --> 01:05:28,601
for more and more drugs.

1548
01:05:28,921 --> 01:05:32,329
After taking the prescribed drugs, he fell asleep...

1549
01:05:32,369 --> 01:05:35,367
and died. So the doctor was brought to court for trial,

1550
01:05:35,392 --> 01:05:37,321
and he was found guilty.

1551
01:05:37,673 --> 01:05:41,736
Propofol became famous in Korea because of this incident, right?

1552
01:05:42,073 --> 01:05:44,246
You could say that. It's also known as the "milk injection".

1553
01:05:44,246 --> 01:05:46,189
The color of the drug is white.

1554
01:05:46,221 --> 01:05:48,228
It's commonly used for endoscopy.

1555
01:05:48,253 --> 01:05:51,010
When it's injected, you lose consciousness...

1556
01:05:51,010 --> 01:05:52,520
and fall asleep.

1557
01:05:52,544 --> 01:05:54,560
It becomes a problem when it's overdosed.

1558
01:05:54,584 --> 01:05:57,128
Yes, this drug is used to make people fall asleep.

1559
01:05:57,159 --> 01:05:59,359
So if it's overdosed, the patient falls asleep...

1560
01:05:59,671 --> 01:06:01,671
and becomes short of breath.

1561
01:06:01,765 --> 01:06:03,677
It can lead to death.

1562
01:06:03,701 --> 01:06:05,405
You have to watch the patient's condition closely.

1563
01:06:06,548 --> 01:06:09,606
In Mexico, there were two sad cases of medical malpractice.

1564
01:06:09,606 --> 01:06:11,406
A baby boy was born...

1565
01:06:11,830 --> 01:06:14,357
and the doctor had to cut the umbilical cord,

1566
01:06:14,405 --> 01:06:15,846
but he cut the baby's penis instead.

1567
01:06:15,871 --> 01:06:17,755
- What? - How can he make a mistake like that?

1568
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:19,389
This is insane.

1569
01:06:19,414 --> 01:06:20,882
Did he doze off?

1570
01:06:20,882 --> 01:06:22,981
- Even I wouldn't get confused. - It's insane.

1571
01:06:23,138 --> 01:06:26,907
So they secretively performed an operation for the baby for three hours.

1572
01:06:26,931 --> 01:06:28,931
In the court, they said...

1573
01:06:29,315 --> 01:06:31,683
they didn't make a mistake and were performing a circumcision.

1574
01:06:31,863 --> 01:06:35,912
- A circumcision? - That's what they said. They made a stupid excuse.

1575
01:06:36,106 --> 01:06:37,809
- That's one case of medical malpractice. - Gosh.

1576
01:06:38,278 --> 01:06:41,006
A baby had a tumor in his brain,

1577
01:06:41,006 --> 01:06:44,439
which affected the eyesight of his left eye. So he needed an operation.

1578
01:06:44,870 --> 01:06:49,659
But the doctor got confused and removed his right eye.

1579
01:06:49,682 --> 01:06:53,627
- What? - So the baby ended up losing both of his eyes.

1580
01:06:53,652 --> 01:06:55,044
Something similar happened in my country.

1581
01:06:55,069 --> 01:06:58,653
Actually, this medical accident happened in my hometown.

1582
01:06:58,677 --> 01:07:00,364
An 80-year-old patient...

1583
01:07:00,805 --> 01:07:04,525
- had a disease, so the doctor had to amputate his leg, - Oh no.

1584
01:07:04,550 --> 01:07:07,408
but the doctor amputated the other leg by mistake.

1585
01:07:07,866 --> 01:07:10,825
So this patient died from the malpractice.

1586
01:07:10,981 --> 01:07:13,744
- What? - It's something that shouldn't have happened.

1587
01:07:13,887 --> 01:07:15,141
For an important operation like this,

1588
01:07:15,630 --> 01:07:17,988
they should've checked at least 17 times.

1589
01:07:17,988 --> 01:07:19,827
- Yes. - They should've checked if his left leg was the problem.

1590
01:07:19,852 --> 01:07:21,730
His mindset is...

1591
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,865
completely different from Namgoong In's.

1592
01:07:24,890 --> 01:07:29,309
It was work for him, so he just looked at the medical chart and amputated his leg.

1593
01:07:29,334 --> 01:07:31,915
Telling left from right is quite confusing.

1594
01:07:31,942 --> 01:07:33,647
(What?)

1595
01:07:33,832 --> 01:07:36,071
- I just got goosebumps. - Oh no.

1596
01:07:36,095 --> 01:07:37,988
What's wrong with you?

1597
01:07:38,013 --> 01:07:39,782
- I thought you were a nice person. - So...

1598
01:07:39,807 --> 01:07:42,512
(What's wrong with you?)

1599
01:07:43,367 --> 01:07:45,991
(What's wrong with you?)

1600
01:07:46,722 --> 01:07:49,106
Of course I double check many times.

1601
01:07:49,249 --> 01:07:51,566
But if you do it every day,

1602
01:07:51,586 --> 01:07:54,794
- things like that happen. - It's an everyday job for doctors.

1603
01:07:54,810 --> 01:07:58,185
- Don't nurses mark it with a pen? - Don't they mark it?

1604
01:07:58,210 --> 01:07:59,875
They do mark it with a pen.

1605
01:07:59,908 --> 01:08:02,531
- The mark it with a huge X sign. - It's so dangerous.

1606
01:08:02,555 --> 01:08:04,700
The system requires you to double check many times.

1607
01:08:04,725 --> 01:08:07,806
- It's still confusing. - Like I said, you'd better wait to have an operation.

1608
01:08:08,263 --> 01:08:11,278
- Well... - I'll wait for six months and go to a nice hospital.

1609
01:08:11,294 --> 01:08:12,950
There's nothing good about rushing.

1610
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:15,095
- France has some serious cases, too. - In France,

1611
01:08:15,375 --> 01:08:17,691
there was a blood scandal in 1980s.

1612
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:21,208
Not many people were aware of AIDS back then.

1613
01:08:21,544 --> 01:08:24,907
HIV-contaminated blood was distributed, infecting many people with AIDS.

1614
01:08:25,177 --> 01:08:26,654
So 600 people died as a result.

1615
01:08:27,374 --> 01:08:28,694
The French Health Minister...

1616
01:08:29,213 --> 01:08:32,294
was sued, but he was found not guilty.

1617
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:35,919
- Not guilty? - When French people...

1618
01:08:35,944 --> 01:08:37,881
see the former Health Minister,

1619
01:08:37,906 --> 01:08:40,454
they think of the blood scandal that had taken place.

1620
01:08:40,989 --> 01:08:44,069
- He's a bit... - So that happened in France.

1621
01:08:44,141 --> 01:08:46,406
Something similar had happened in Korea.

1622
01:08:46,430 --> 01:08:50,318
I don't know if they actually reused syringes at the clinic.

1623
01:08:50,677 --> 01:08:53,326
Hepatitis C was spread among the patients...

1624
01:08:53,710 --> 01:08:55,942
who got IV shots at the clinic.

1625
01:08:55,966 --> 01:08:58,757
So a few hundred people were infected with hepatitis C virus.

1626
01:08:58,765 --> 01:09:00,086
It's a serious virus.

1627
01:09:00,438 --> 01:09:02,453
- That happened in Korea. - I see.

1628
01:09:02,507 --> 01:09:05,083
Since we have a doctor as our guest today,

1629
01:09:05,244 --> 01:09:08,083
let's ask questions to Emergency Physician Dr. Namgoong In.

1630
01:09:08,849 --> 01:09:11,424
- Any questions from your everyday life? - What's your question?

1631
01:09:11,424 --> 01:09:14,899
In Korea, people say eating apple at night is bad for your health.

1632
01:09:14,926 --> 01:09:18,572
- Yes. - Actually, I argued about it with my friend.

1633
01:09:18,595 --> 01:09:20,676
Eating apple in the morning is good, and eating it at night is bad.

1634
01:09:20,676 --> 01:09:24,507
- What is the truth? - People only say it in Korea.

1635
01:09:24,795 --> 01:09:27,171
Since apple contains a lot of sugar content,

1636
01:09:27,193 --> 01:09:29,611
it's a little hard to digest if you eat apples at night.

1637
01:09:29,835 --> 01:09:32,125
Maybe that's why people say it's bad for you.

1638
01:09:32,150 --> 01:09:36,400
- All fruits are hard to digest at night. - You drink 20 or 30 glasses of bomb shot.

1639
01:09:36,424 --> 01:09:38,627
It's better to sleep after eating an apple.

1640
01:09:39,026 --> 01:09:41,108
- Right. - So I don't think...

1641
01:09:41,153 --> 01:09:43,735
- eating an apple at night will affect your health. - So the content is fine.

1642
01:09:43,735 --> 01:09:46,018
- Yes. - It's just a little hard to digest.

1643
01:09:46,131 --> 01:09:48,315
Your stomach might feel heavy. That's why people say that.

1644
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:50,135
- It's completely fine. - I have a question, too.

1645
01:09:50,567 --> 01:09:54,312
People say you'll die if you sleep with a fan blowing on you. Is that true?

1646
01:09:54,491 --> 01:09:56,501
In India, we have fans on the ceiling.

1647
01:09:56,526 --> 01:09:58,436
We're fine, but Koreans keep saying that.

1648
01:09:58,461 --> 01:09:59,643
You won't die from it.

1649
01:09:59,668 --> 01:10:02,080
- Right? - That can never be the cause of death.

1650
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:04,129
When electric fans were first introduced...

1651
01:10:04,169 --> 01:10:06,929
to Korea in 1920s, old people made jokes to save electricity.

1652
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:09,003
People are still believing that?

1653
01:10:09,003 --> 01:10:11,155
- That myth has been going on for 100 years. - It's so sad.

1654
01:10:11,201 --> 01:10:13,335
- It's a myth. - People are still believing it.

1655
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:14,914
People say...

1656
01:10:14,915 --> 01:10:16,729
- you lose your fortune if you shake your leg. - Yes.

1657
01:10:16,745 --> 01:10:19,713
- It's actually good for you. It prevents you from having varicose veins. - Really?

1658
01:10:19,729 --> 01:10:22,308
- They said it's good for you. It's good to move your legs. - Really?

1659
01:10:22,333 --> 01:10:23,880
I have a question.

1660
01:10:23,905 --> 01:10:26,049
When you get a medical checkup,

1661
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:29,008
you get an endoscopy.

1662
01:10:29,032 --> 01:10:31,697
Is it better to have a sleep endoscopy?

1663
01:10:31,984 --> 01:10:34,881
Or should I just get a normal endoscopy?

1664
01:10:34,906 --> 01:10:37,098
Which one will you choose?

1665
01:10:37,512 --> 01:10:40,696
When you prepare for a sleep endoscopy, the drug content itself...

1666
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:42,262
isn't really bad for your health.

1667
01:10:42,287 --> 01:10:46,002
The drug content doesn't make you fall asleep.

1668
01:10:46,017 --> 01:10:48,121
Patients can still move their body.

1669
01:10:48,153 --> 01:10:50,393
Sometimes they speak as well.

1670
01:10:50,393 --> 01:10:53,942
So watching them made me feel that I should get an awake endoscopy.

1671
01:10:53,957 --> 01:10:57,047
- It's the normal endoscopy. - People say you need to gather up your courage.

1672
01:10:57,077 --> 01:10:58,449
I was scared, so I've never tried it.

1673
01:10:58,474 --> 01:11:00,283
- You've never tried, have you? - No, it's scary.

1674
01:11:00,283 --> 01:11:02,295
If you haven't tried it, please don't say anything.

1675
01:11:02,295 --> 01:11:05,534
I got a normal endoscopy because I didn't have enough time.

1676
01:11:05,566 --> 01:11:07,481
- Getting a gastroscopy wasn't too bad. - Really?

1677
01:11:07,506 --> 01:11:11,734
It only took five minutes. I had a gag reflex, and that was it.

1678
01:11:12,215 --> 01:11:14,696
But getting a colonoscopy is no joke. It's so painful.

1679
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:16,416
Air is injected into your colon.

1680
01:11:16,576 --> 01:11:19,432
It was just... I'm talking about colonoscopy.

1681
01:11:19,495 --> 01:11:21,032
- Oh! - Did you get a sleep endoscopy?

1682
01:11:21,296 --> 01:11:23,032
I got a normal colonoscopy.

1683
01:11:23,352 --> 01:11:27,197
At first, the nurses insert a tube. It's as big as this.

1684
01:11:28,994 --> 01:11:30,980
(My goodness!)

1685
01:11:31,005 --> 01:11:33,230
I'm serious. They insert a tube as big as this.

1686
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:35,359
I'm not talking about my buttocks, and it didn't hurt.

1687
01:11:35,854 --> 01:11:37,777
- But I felt the pain in the abdominal area. - Of course.

1688
01:11:37,801 --> 01:11:40,809
They injected air into my colon, so my belly swelled up.

1689
01:11:40,915 --> 01:11:43,907
It was no joke. If you haven't tried it, don't even talk about it.

1690
01:11:43,907 --> 01:11:46,620
- Try the sleep endoscopy next time. - Sleep endoscopy is better.

1691
01:11:46,669 --> 01:11:49,021
It was Namgoong In's issue for the 125th Non Summit Meeting.

1692
01:11:49,044 --> 01:11:52,237
"Sometimes, emotional feelings come before rational decisions. Am I abnormal?"

1693
01:11:52,261 --> 01:11:53,769
That was today's topic.

1694
01:11:53,770 --> 01:11:56,346
Schweitzer, who had helped people with his medical knowledge based on humanity,

1695
01:11:56,842 --> 01:11:58,211
said this.

1696
01:11:58,226 --> 01:12:01,099
"Sometimes, emotional feelings come before rational decisions. Am I abnormal?"

1697
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:02,847
That was today's topic.

1698
01:12:02,866 --> 01:12:05,418
Schweitzer, who had helped people with his medical knowledge based on humanity,

1699
01:12:05,898 --> 01:12:07,314
said this.

1700
01:12:07,330 --> 01:12:09,962
"The way you see the world decides your fate."

1701
01:12:11,356 --> 01:12:13,940
Let's hear it in German.

1702
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:21,290
Schweitzer is known as a French-German doctor.

1703
01:12:21,626 --> 01:12:23,658
Let's hear it in French.

1704
01:12:26,846 --> 01:12:28,198
Did he say vitamins?

1705
01:12:28,898 --> 01:12:30,453
- Vitamins? - All right.

1706
01:12:30,894 --> 01:12:33,733
If the way you see the emergency patients decides your fate,

1707
01:12:33,758 --> 01:12:35,918
how will you look at them?

1708
01:12:35,919 --> 01:12:38,128
Seeing emergency patients is my job,

1709
01:12:38,153 --> 01:12:40,863
so it's my fate.

1710
01:12:40,888 --> 01:12:43,352
I think the fate of the emergency patients...

1711
01:12:43,376 --> 01:12:46,128
is my fate. With that thought in mind,

1712
01:12:46,152 --> 01:12:49,016
I will try to be humble and work hard.

1713
01:12:49,935 --> 01:12:51,312
How did you feel today?

1714
01:12:51,688 --> 01:12:53,421
As a Korean doctor,

1715
01:12:53,446 --> 01:12:56,575
it was interesting to hear what's happening in each country's medical field.

1716
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:58,141
They all speak good Korean.

1717
01:12:58,141 --> 01:13:01,862
I had a lot of fun today. Thank you.

1718
01:13:01,902 --> 01:13:03,678
- Okay. - Thank you.

1719
01:13:03,703 --> 01:13:06,549
- It was good to have a doctor as our guest. - Yes.

1720
01:13:06,574 --> 01:13:09,557
We enjoyed having you here with us. Thank you.

1721
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:11,943
I would now like to adjourn Non Summit Meeting.

1722
01:13:12,167 --> 01:13:13,616
Until the day we all become normal.

1723
01:13:14,039 --> 01:13:17,303
I wish people in this world would never have to feel any pain.

1724
01:13:17,883 --> 01:13:19,883
Let's live happily

1725
01:13:20,023 --> 01:13:21,912
Don't get sick

1726
01:13:23,180 --> 01:13:25,325
Don't get sick

1727
