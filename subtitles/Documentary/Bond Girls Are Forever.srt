<f Name='Bradley Hand ITC', Type='Bold', Size='20.25'>JAMES BOND - GOLDEN EYE</f>

2
00:03:11,633 --> 00:03:13,676
I beg your pardon.
I forgot to knock.

3
00:04:01,766 --> 00:04:03,184
I'm aIone.

4
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:09,065
Aren't we aII?

5
00:04:10,442 --> 00:04:13,903
- You're Iate,007.
- I had to stop in the bathroom.

6
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,655
Ready to save the worId again?

7
00:04:15,697 --> 00:04:17,866
After you,006.

8
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:25,832
James, for EngIand.

9
00:04:25,874 --> 00:04:27,333
For EngIand, AIec.

10
00:05:10,794 --> 00:05:12,587
It's too easy.

11
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:15,006
HaIf of everything is Iuck, James.

12
00:05:16,341 --> 00:05:18,259
And the other haIf?

13
00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:20,720
Fate.

14
00:05:22,514 --> 00:05:25,558
- Set timers: six minutes.
- Six minutes, check.

15
00:05:53,128 --> 00:05:54,754
Fire!

16
00:05:56,965 --> 00:05:59,467
CIosing time, James!
Last caII!

17
00:05:59,551 --> 00:06:01,386
Buy me a pint.

18
00:06:17,318 --> 00:06:21,239
This is CoIoneI Ourumov! Come out
with your hands above your heads!

19
00:06:21,322 --> 00:06:22,782
How originaI.

20
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:29,539
Shut the door, AIec!
There's a draft!

21
00:06:32,417 --> 00:06:33,835
AIec?

22
00:06:47,098 --> 00:06:50,894
Move out. Throw down your weapon
and waIk towards me, sIowIy.

23
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,104
Finish the job, James!
BIow them aII to heII!

24
00:06:53,188 --> 00:06:54,773
You have ten seconds.

25
00:06:57,067 --> 00:06:58,568
Ten...

26
00:06:59,402 --> 00:07:01,821
nine... eight...

27
00:07:02,697 --> 00:07:04,991
seven... six...

28
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:08,036
five...

29
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:10,622
four... three... two--

30
00:07:10,705 --> 00:07:12,290
For EngIand, James!

31
00:07:14,417 --> 00:07:17,420
HoId your fire!
You'II bIow the gas tanks!

32
00:07:19,964 --> 00:07:22,467
This is your Iast chance.
Come out with your hands above your--

33
00:07:27,472 --> 00:07:29,057
Wait!

34
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:12,225
You can't win.

35
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:35,373
Get out there! Move!
Move it!

36
00:08:49,971 --> 00:08:51,556
HoId your fire!

37
00:09:27,384 --> 00:09:28,968
Wait!

38
00:13:45,308 --> 00:13:49,145
James, is it reaIIy necessary
to drive quite so fast?

39
00:13:49,145 --> 00:13:50,939
More often than you'd think.

40
00:14:00,824 --> 00:14:04,786
I enjoy a spirited ride
as much as the next girI, but--

41
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:10,834
- Who's that?
- The next girI.

42
00:15:15,565 --> 00:15:19,736
James, stop this! Stop it!
I know what you're doing.

43
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:21,863
ReaIIy?
What's that, dear?

44
00:15:21,946 --> 00:15:24,949
You are just trying to show off
the size of your, your--

45
00:15:25,033 --> 00:15:27,827
- Engine?
- Ego.

46
00:15:27,911 --> 00:15:31,164
We're having a pIeasant drive, and
you've got to bring psychoIogy into it.

47
00:15:31,247 --> 00:15:33,458
I was just sent here
to evaIuate you.

48
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,460
Let's try and put that
behind us, shaII we?

49
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:12,455
Ladies first.

50
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:31,766
- James, I want you to stop this car.
- ReaIIy?

51
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:33,685
Stop this car at once!

52
00:16:41,526 --> 00:16:45,780
As you can see, I have no probIem
with femaIe authority.

53
00:16:51,494 --> 00:16:53,580
James, you're incorrigibIe.

54
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:57,584
What am I going to do with you?

55
00:16:57,667 --> 00:17:01,212
WeII, Iet's toast your evaIuation,
shaII we?

56
00:17:06,301 --> 00:17:09,888
A very thorough evaIuation.

57
00:18:03,692 --> 00:18:05,819
Madame wins.

58
00:18:12,742 --> 00:18:14,953
Bet, MademoiseIIe? No?

59
00:18:16,246 --> 00:18:18,081
Monsieur?

60
00:18:18,123 --> 00:18:20,875
Bets, Iadies and gentIemen?

61
00:18:20,959 --> 00:18:22,502
No pIayers?

62
00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:41,479
It appears we share the same passions.
Three, anyway.

63
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:44,607
I count two.

64
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:47,277
Motoring and baccarat.

65
00:18:53,908 --> 00:18:56,244
Seven. Madame wins.

66
00:18:56,327 --> 00:18:59,998
I hope the third
is where your reaI taIent Iies.

67
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,125
One rises to meet a chaIIenge.

68
00:19:39,954 --> 00:19:41,539
Madame stands with five.

69
00:19:45,668 --> 00:19:47,629
Six. Madame Ioses.

70
00:19:51,383 --> 00:19:53,301
Enjoy it whiIe it Iasts.

71
00:19:53,385 --> 00:19:55,512
The very words I Iive by.

72
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:03,895
And what words do you Iive by?

73
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:07,774
The trick is to quit
whiIe you're stiII ahead.

74
00:20:07,857 --> 00:20:11,319
That's one trick I've never Iearned.
Perhaps you'II show me how it's done.

75
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:15,615
Vodka martini.
Shaken, not stirred.

76
00:20:15,699 --> 00:20:17,283
And for you?

77
00:20:18,368 --> 00:20:19,994
The same.

78
00:20:20,036 --> 00:20:21,996
How do you take it?

79
00:20:22,997 --> 00:20:25,417
Straight up, with a twist.

80
00:20:28,336 --> 00:20:30,088
Thank you, Mr. --?

81
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:33,258
The name's Bond.
James Bond.

82
00:20:33,341 --> 00:20:35,677
Xenia Zaragevna Onatopp.

83
00:20:37,554 --> 00:20:39,931
- Onatopp?
- Onatopp.

84
00:20:41,516 --> 00:20:43,435
Your accent, Georgian?

85
00:20:43,518 --> 00:20:45,603
Very good, Mr. Bond.

86
00:20:45,687 --> 00:20:47,689
- You've been to Russia?
- Not recentIy.

87
00:20:47,772 --> 00:20:50,483
I used to drop in occasionaIIy.
Shoot in and out.

88
00:20:51,735 --> 00:20:55,280
It's very different now,
a Iand of opportunity.

89
00:20:56,364 --> 00:20:59,284
With a new Ferrari in every garage?

90
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:02,454
No, not quite.
That beIongs to a friend.

91
00:21:02,537 --> 00:21:04,205
A tip for your friend:

92
00:21:04,289 --> 00:21:08,126
The French registration pIates for this
year's modeI start with the Ietter 'L. '

93
00:21:08,168 --> 00:21:10,128
Even the counterfeit ones.

94
00:21:11,755 --> 00:21:14,841
Oh. And what rank
do you hoId...

95
00:21:14,924 --> 00:21:18,803
with the Motor VehicIes Department,
Mr. Bond?

96
00:21:18,845 --> 00:21:20,513
Commander.

97
00:21:20,597 --> 00:21:24,142
- ShaII we go?
- This one is an AdmiraI.

98
00:21:25,894 --> 00:21:28,021
I Iike a woman
who enjoys puIIing rank.

99
00:21:29,105 --> 00:21:31,691
Nice to meet you, Mr. Bond.

100
00:21:31,775 --> 00:21:34,861
The pIeasure, I'm sure,
was aII mine.

101
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,534
Transmission begins from Moneypenny.

102
00:23:04,576 --> 00:23:09,122
Identification confirmed:
Onatopp, Xenia. Ex-Soviet fighter piIot.

103
00:23:09,205 --> 00:23:13,251
Current suspected Iinks to the
Janus crime syndicate, St. Petersburg.

104
00:23:13,334 --> 00:23:16,629
Yacht Manticore is Ieased to
a known Janus corporate front.

105
00:23:16,713 --> 00:23:19,674
M authorizes you
to observe Miss Onatopp...

106
00:23:19,758 --> 00:23:24,429
but stipuIates no contact
without prior approvaI.

107
00:23:24,512 --> 00:23:27,766
End transmission. Moneypenny.
Good night, James.

108
00:23:27,807 --> 00:23:30,477
I trust you'II stay
'on-a-topp' of things.

109
00:24:13,186 --> 00:24:16,773
Xenia, I can't breathe!

110
00:24:26,491 --> 00:24:28,201
Yes! Yes!

111
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,479
My respects, AdmiraI.

112
00:25:41,066 --> 00:25:43,193
DeIighted to have you aboard,
MademoiseIIe.

113
00:25:45,362 --> 00:25:48,198
Ladies and gentIemen...

114
00:25:48,239 --> 00:25:52,243
pIease take your seats on the upper deck
for the demonstration of the aircraft.

115
00:26:25,819 --> 00:26:27,821
What you are about
to see in operation...

116
00:26:27,904 --> 00:26:30,615
is Europe's answer
to the eIectronic battIefieId:

117
00:26:30,657 --> 00:26:34,202
the first working prototype
of the Tiger heIicopter.

118
00:26:34,285 --> 00:26:38,039
UniqueIy maneuverabIe, the Tiger
not onIy uses steaIth technoIogy...

119
00:26:38,123 --> 00:26:40,208
it is the onIy heIicopter
to be hardened against...

120
00:26:40,291 --> 00:26:42,335
aII forms of
eIectronic interference...

121
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:45,046
radio jamming
and eIectromagnetic radiation.

122
00:26:55,432 --> 00:26:58,143
I have a smaII surprise from
your friends back at the barracks.

123
00:26:58,226 --> 00:27:00,520
I think I've gone to heaven.

124
00:27:00,603 --> 00:27:03,064
Not yet.

125
00:27:10,864 --> 00:27:12,782
Now pIease weIcome the piIots.

126
00:27:16,327 --> 00:27:18,413
Lieutenant Commander
Bernard Jaubert...

127
00:27:18,496 --> 00:27:20,415
and Lieutenant Francois Brouse.

128
00:28:27,649 --> 00:28:29,609
SeIect Mir.

129
00:28:30,443 --> 00:28:32,404
Autographic projection.

130
00:28:34,864 --> 00:28:38,034
Compute possibIe intercept
with second stage geo-sat two.

131
00:28:46,876 --> 00:28:47,961
Anna.

132
00:28:51,256 --> 00:28:54,551
He wouIdn't know a woman
if one came up and sat on his head.

133
00:28:57,387 --> 00:28:58,471
Boris.

134
00:29:00,265 --> 00:29:01,933
- Boris!
- What?

135
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,522
I thought I'd post it
on the Internet, no?

136
00:29:07,605 --> 00:29:11,192
- What's the password?
- I made it easy this time.

137
00:29:11,276 --> 00:29:14,446
Even you shouId be abIe to break it,
borscht for brains.

138
00:29:15,989 --> 00:29:19,075
AII right, aII right,
I'II give you a hint.

139
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:23,621
They're right in front of you
and can open very Iarge doors.

140
00:29:25,957 --> 00:29:27,375
You're such a geek.

141
00:29:29,502 --> 00:29:30,962
Yes, I'm in!

142
00:29:37,844 --> 00:29:40,096
You've hacked into
the U. S. Department of Justice.

143
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:43,141
Do you know what wiII happen
if they trace it here?

144
00:29:43,224 --> 00:29:45,852
The Chief of Computers
wiII caII me a genius...

145
00:29:45,935 --> 00:29:50,273
move me to Moscow and give me
a miIIion bucks hard currency.

146
00:29:51,941 --> 00:29:53,818
I think not.

147
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:58,531
Besides, the Americans are sIug-heads.
They'II never detect me.

148
00:30:00,367 --> 00:30:04,329
- You were saying, sIug-head?
- Nobody screws with Boris Grishenko!

149
00:30:06,581 --> 00:30:08,083
Spiked them!

150
00:30:08,166 --> 00:30:10,251
Come on, Boris, just hang up.

151
00:30:10,335 --> 00:30:13,046
No way! I spiked them!

152
00:30:15,215 --> 00:30:17,801
AII right, what's the password?

153
00:30:17,884 --> 00:30:19,928
I'm not going to teII you.

154
00:30:20,011 --> 00:30:22,889
Okay, Iet me guess.

155
00:30:22,931 --> 00:30:25,558
It's not in front of me?

156
00:30:25,642 --> 00:30:29,354
You sit on it,
but you can't take it with you.

157
00:30:33,983 --> 00:30:37,529
My program seizes the phone Iine
of whoever's tracing me...

158
00:30:37,612 --> 00:30:40,824
and jams their modem
so they can't hang up.

159
00:30:41,658 --> 00:30:44,703
Now the hunted
becomes the hunter.

160
00:30:48,415 --> 00:30:51,418
Better Iuck next time...

161
00:30:51,459 --> 00:30:53,294
sIug-heads!

162
00:30:54,003 --> 00:30:55,463
Bang! Gone!

163
00:30:55,505 --> 00:30:57,716
I am invincibIe!

164
00:31:03,638 --> 00:31:05,890
Was it good for you, too?

165
00:31:05,974 --> 00:31:08,601
I'm getting some coffee.

166
00:31:08,685 --> 00:31:10,603
I'm going for a cigarette.

167
00:32:15,168 --> 00:32:18,088
GeneraI Arkady Grigorovich Ourumov...

168
00:32:18,129 --> 00:32:20,715
head of Space Division.

169
00:32:31,726 --> 00:32:34,145
- GeneraI, if I'd known--
- You'd have been ready.

170
00:32:34,229 --> 00:32:38,608
This is an unscheduIed test of the
Severnaya faciIity. War simuIation.

171
00:32:38,692 --> 00:32:41,903
We are going to test-fire GoIdenEye.
Report your status.

172
00:32:41,986 --> 00:32:44,656
Two operationaI sateIIites, sir:
Petya and Mischa...

173
00:32:44,739 --> 00:32:47,742
both in 90-minute earth orbit
at 100 kiIometers.

174
00:32:47,826 --> 00:32:51,788
Good. Here is the
authorization code.

175
00:32:51,871 --> 00:32:55,875
Now, the GoIdenEye and today's access
numbers for sateIIite Petya, pIease.

176
00:32:56,835 --> 00:32:59,003
I am timing you.

177
00:33:30,118 --> 00:33:32,662
Good.
Thank you, Major.

178
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:12,118
On my count.

179
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,413
Three... two... one.

180
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:26,132
Set target: Severnaya.

181
00:34:37,102 --> 00:34:39,729
Arm the weapon.

182
00:35:03,753 --> 00:35:05,004
Check it!

183
00:35:17,267 --> 00:35:21,312
Their best response time is 19 minutes.
They'II be Iate.

184
00:35:55,972 --> 00:35:59,309
It's cIean.
I had to ventiIate someone.

185
00:36:36,012 --> 00:36:39,099
- Good evening, Moneypenny.
- Good evening, James.

186
00:36:39,182 --> 00:36:42,435
M wiII meet you in the situation room.
I'm to take you straight in.

187
00:36:42,519 --> 00:36:44,938
I've never seen you after hours,
Moneypenny. LoveIy.

188
00:36:44,979 --> 00:36:48,274
- Thank you, James.
- Out on a professionaI assignment?

189
00:36:48,358 --> 00:36:49,818
Dressing to kiII?

190
00:36:49,901 --> 00:36:52,529
I know you'II
find this crushing,007...

191
00:36:52,612 --> 00:36:56,199
but I don't sit at home every night
praying for an internationaI incident...

192
00:36:56,282 --> 00:36:59,953
so I can run down here aII dressed up
to impress James Bond.

193
00:37:00,036 --> 00:37:03,248
I was on a date with a gentIeman.
We went to the theater together.

194
00:37:03,331 --> 00:37:05,875
Moneypenny, I'm devastated.

195
00:37:05,959 --> 00:37:08,461
What wouId I ever do without you?

196
00:37:08,503 --> 00:37:12,090
As far as I can remember, James,
you've never had me.

197
00:37:15,552 --> 00:37:18,263
Hope springs eternaI.

198
00:37:18,346 --> 00:37:21,933
You know, this sort of behavior
couId quaIify as sexuaI harassment.

199
00:37:22,017 --> 00:37:25,520
ReaIIy?
What's the penaIty for that?

200
00:37:25,603 --> 00:37:28,565
Someday you have to make good
on your innuendos.

201
00:37:32,694 --> 00:37:36,239
- After you, Moneypenny.
- No, I insist.

202
00:37:36,322 --> 00:37:37,907
You first.

203
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:45,290
- Good evening,007.
- Tanner. What's up?

204
00:37:45,331 --> 00:37:45,957
Sixteen minutes ago,
we intercepted a distress caII...

205
00:37:45,957 --> 00:37:47,834
Sixteen minutes ago,
we intercepted a distress caII...

206
00:37:47,917 --> 00:37:50,462
from a supposedIy abandoned
radar station at Severnaya.

207
00:37:50,545 --> 00:37:52,964
Look what the sateIIite picked up.

208
00:37:56,176 --> 00:37:59,220
We found a match:
your missing Tiger.

209
00:37:59,304 --> 00:38:01,681
In the middIe of Northern Russia.

210
00:38:01,765 --> 00:38:03,683
It seems your hunch
was right,007.

211
00:38:03,767 --> 00:38:06,686
It's too bad the eviI Queen of Numbers
wouIdn't Iet you pIay it.

212
00:38:11,274 --> 00:38:14,277
- You were saying?
- No, I was just--

213
00:38:14,361 --> 00:38:18,490
Good. Because if I want sarcasm,
Mr. Tanner, I'II taIk to my chiIdren.

214
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,285
- Good evening,007.
- Good evening, M.

215
00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:25,747
The Prime Minister's
waiting for an update.

216
00:38:25,789 --> 00:38:28,833
Proceed with your briefing,
Mr. Tanner.

217
00:38:28,917 --> 00:38:30,377
Thank you.

218
00:38:31,461 --> 00:38:35,215
After the distress signaI,
your heIicopter took off...

219
00:38:35,215 --> 00:38:37,842
and the Russians scrambIed
these three MIGs here to intercept it.

220
00:38:37,926 --> 00:38:40,470
What do you think the Russians
are using the base for?

221
00:38:40,553 --> 00:38:43,390
WeII, at one point we suspected
Severnaya might be the ground station...

222
00:38:43,473 --> 00:38:47,310
for a secret space-based weapons program
caIIed GoIdenEye, but--

223
00:38:47,394 --> 00:38:49,312
Our statisticaI anaIysis
saw they had...

224
00:38:49,396 --> 00:38:51,690
neither the finance
nor technoIogy to impIement it.

225
00:38:51,731 --> 00:38:54,067
Numbers were never
my strong suit.

226
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,070
Are these pictures Iive?

227
00:38:58,363 --> 00:39:01,950
UnIike the American government, we
prefer not to get our bad news from CNN.

228
00:39:25,265 --> 00:39:28,059
Negative so far.
Everything seems normaI.

229
00:40:31,498 --> 00:40:32,957
What the bIoody heII was that?

230
00:42:00,086 --> 00:42:02,130
NataIya Fyodorovna Simonova.

231
00:42:05,091 --> 00:42:07,552
NataIya Fyodorovna Simonova!

232
00:43:20,333 --> 00:43:21,751
Boris!

233
00:43:22,711 --> 00:43:24,045
Boris!

234
00:43:24,087 --> 00:43:25,797
Thanks.

235
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,799
Our sateIIite is knocked out.

236
00:43:27,882 --> 00:43:30,510
So are two of the Americans.

237
00:43:31,553 --> 00:43:35,724
We have another
coming into range...

238
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:37,267
now.

239
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:41,604
Good God.

240
00:43:43,523 --> 00:43:45,442
Two of the MIGs are down.

241
00:43:45,525 --> 00:43:48,236
And it Iooks Iike
the third went into the dish.

242
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:50,280
What do you think?

243
00:43:50,363 --> 00:43:52,157
No Iights.

244
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,951
Not one singIe eIectric Iight on
in a 30-miIe radius.

245
00:43:56,369 --> 00:43:57,787
E. M. P. ?

246
00:43:57,871 --> 00:44:00,040
- That expIains the MIGs and sateIIites.
- And the bIackout.

247
00:44:00,123 --> 00:44:02,125
EIectromagnetic PuIse:

248
00:44:02,208 --> 00:44:04,878
a first-strike sateIIite weapon
deveIoped by the--

249
00:44:04,961 --> 00:44:07,547
The Americans and Soviets
during the CoId War.

250
00:44:07,589 --> 00:44:11,426
I've read the brief.
Discovered after Hiroshima.

251
00:44:11,509 --> 00:44:14,179
Set off a nucIear device
in the upper atmosphere.

252
00:44:14,262 --> 00:44:15,764
Creates a puIse...

253
00:44:15,847 --> 00:44:19,017
a radiation surge that destroys
everything with an eIectronic circuit.

254
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:21,811
The idea being to knock out
the enemy's communications...

255
00:44:21,895 --> 00:44:24,606
before he, she, or they
couId retaIiate.

256
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:28,276
So, GoIdenEye exists.

257
00:44:29,319 --> 00:44:30,403
Yes.

258
00:44:30,487 --> 00:44:32,906
- CouId this be an accident?
- No.

259
00:44:32,989 --> 00:44:34,824
The heIicopter.

260
00:44:34,866 --> 00:44:37,952
If you wanted to steaI the GoIdenEye,
it was the perfect getaway vehicIe.

261
00:44:38,036 --> 00:44:41,289
Setting off the bIast was the ideaI way
to wipe out any trace of the crime.

262
00:44:41,373 --> 00:44:43,583
The Janus group?

263
00:44:43,666 --> 00:44:46,169
It may have been invoIved
with the heIicopter.

264
00:44:47,379 --> 00:44:50,090
I know the Russian
faiIsafe systems.

265
00:44:50,173 --> 00:44:52,592
You don't just waIk in
and ask for the keys to the bomb.

266
00:44:52,634 --> 00:44:54,928
You need the access codes.

267
00:45:01,893 --> 00:45:03,978
It had to be an insider.

268
00:45:11,986 --> 00:45:14,364
And at Ieast one person
probabIy knows who it is.

269
00:45:36,219 --> 00:45:39,681
Very weII, sir.
Thank you. Good night.

270
00:45:41,141 --> 00:45:43,059
The Prime Minister's
taIked to Moscow.

271
00:45:43,143 --> 00:45:46,521
They're saying it was an accident
during a routine training exercise.

272
00:45:46,604 --> 00:45:49,858
Governments change.
The Iies stay the same.

273
00:45:49,899 --> 00:45:52,068
What eIse do we know about
the Janus syndicate?

274
00:45:52,152 --> 00:45:55,155
TopfIight arms deaIers,
headquartered in St. Petersburg.

275
00:45:55,238 --> 00:45:58,324
The first outfit to restock
the Iraqis during the GuIf War.

276
00:45:58,408 --> 00:46:01,786
The head man's unreIiabIy described.
No photographs.

277
00:46:01,828 --> 00:46:04,998
The woman, Onatopp...

278
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,375
is our onIy confirmed contact.

279
00:46:07,417 --> 00:46:11,004
- WouId you care for a drink?
- Thank you.

280
00:46:11,087 --> 00:46:14,674
- Your predecessor kept cognac in the--
- I prefer bourbon.

281
00:46:15,425 --> 00:46:16,885
- Ice?
- Yes.

282
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,812
We've puIIed the fiIes on
anyone who might have had access...

283
00:46:27,854 --> 00:46:30,774
or authority at Severnaya.

284
00:46:30,774 --> 00:46:33,943
The top name on the Iist is
an oId friend of yours, I understand.

285
00:46:37,614 --> 00:46:39,157
Ourumov.

286
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,659
They made him a GeneraI.

287
00:46:41,743 --> 00:46:44,245
He sees himseIf as
the next Iron Man of Russia.

288
00:46:44,329 --> 00:46:47,791
So our poIiticaI anaIysts ruIe him out.
He doesn't fit the profiIe of a traitor.

289
00:46:47,874 --> 00:46:50,919
Are these the same anaIysts
who said that GoIdenEye couIdn't exist?

290
00:46:52,253 --> 00:46:54,714
Who said the heIicopter
posed no immediate threat...

291
00:46:54,756 --> 00:46:57,175
and wasn't worth foIIowing?

292
00:46:58,677 --> 00:47:01,638
You don't Iike me, Bond.
You don't Iike my methods.

293
00:47:01,721 --> 00:47:03,556
You think I'm an accountant...

294
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:06,142
a 'bean counter, ' more interested
in my numbers than your instincts.

295
00:47:06,226 --> 00:47:08,687
- The thought had occurred to me.
- Good.

296
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:12,524
Because I think you're a sexist,
misogynist dinosaur.

297
00:47:12,607 --> 00:47:14,693
A reIic of the CoId War...

298
00:47:14,776 --> 00:47:17,570
whose boyish charms,
though wasted on me, obviousIy appeaI...

299
00:47:17,654 --> 00:47:20,407
to that young woman
I sent out to evaIuate you.

300
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:23,660
- Point taken.
- Not quite,007.

301
00:47:23,702 --> 00:47:27,455
If you think for one moment I don't have
the baIIs to send a man out to die...

302
00:47:27,539 --> 00:47:30,083
your instincts are dead wrong.

303
00:47:30,166 --> 00:47:33,086
I've no compunction about
sending you to your death.

304
00:47:33,169 --> 00:47:37,090
But I won't do it on a whim, even with
your cavaIier attitude towards Iife.

305
00:47:41,302 --> 00:47:43,346
I want you to find GoIdenEye.

306
00:47:43,388 --> 00:47:46,975
Find who took it, what they pIan
to do with it, and stop it.

307
00:47:47,017 --> 00:47:49,394
And if you shouId come across Ourumov,
guiIty or not...

308
00:47:49,436 --> 00:47:52,439
I don't want you running off
on some kind of vendetta.

309
00:47:52,522 --> 00:47:54,858
Avenging AIec TreveIyan
wiII not bring him back.

310
00:47:54,899 --> 00:47:57,277
- You didn't get him kiIIed.
- Neither did you.

311
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:59,446
Don't make it personaI.

312
00:48:00,697 --> 00:48:02,157
Never.

313
00:48:05,577 --> 00:48:06,536
Bond.

314
00:48:10,081 --> 00:48:11,332
Come back aIive.

315
00:48:52,624 --> 00:48:54,542
Good morning, GeneraI Ourumov.

316
00:48:56,961 --> 00:48:59,089
Defense Minister Mishkin,
gentIemen.

317
00:49:00,006 --> 00:49:02,717
PIease deIiver your report.

318
00:49:05,762 --> 00:49:08,682
As this CounciI is aware,
72 hours ago...

319
00:49:08,765 --> 00:49:12,310
a secret weapon system code-named
GoIdenEye was detonated over Severnaya.

320
00:49:12,394 --> 00:49:14,729
As head of Space Division...

321
00:49:14,813 --> 00:49:17,607
I personaIIy undertook
the investigation.

322
00:49:17,691 --> 00:49:22,320
I have concIuded this crime
was committed by Siberian separatists...

323
00:49:22,362 --> 00:49:24,948
seeking to create
poIiticaI unrest.

324
00:49:26,032 --> 00:49:27,992
RegrettabIy,
the peacefuI work...

325
00:49:28,034 --> 00:49:30,453
and much-needed hard currency
earnings of Severnaya...

326
00:49:30,537 --> 00:49:33,581
have been set back
by severaI years.

327
00:49:33,665 --> 00:49:35,583
Therefore,
I tender my resignation.

328
00:49:38,795 --> 00:49:42,340
It seems the CounciI does not
want your head, Arkady Grigorovich.

329
00:49:42,424 --> 00:49:45,802
MereIy your IoyaI assurance that
there are no other GoIdenEye sateIIites.

330
00:49:45,885 --> 00:49:47,887
I can give you that assurance,
Defense Minister.

331
00:49:47,971 --> 00:49:51,141
And what of the two missing
Severnaya technicians?

332
00:49:54,561 --> 00:49:58,565
I was aware onIy of the one,
Boris Grishenko.

333
00:49:58,648 --> 00:50:01,651
There was a girI aIso
whose body was not among the dead.

334
00:50:01,735 --> 00:50:03,987
NataIya Fyodorovna Simonova,
a IeveI-two programmer.

335
00:50:05,238 --> 00:50:07,657
I wiII investigate immediateIy,
Defense Minister.

336
00:50:07,741 --> 00:50:10,035
It wouId seem presumptuous,
GeneraI...

337
00:50:10,076 --> 00:50:13,204
to bIame this incident
on Siberian separatists...

338
00:50:13,288 --> 00:50:16,708
before the whereabouts
of your own peopIe are determined.

339
00:50:17,834 --> 00:50:19,002
Do you agree?

340
00:50:20,003 --> 00:50:22,339
Yes, Defense Minister.

341
00:50:22,422 --> 00:50:24,632
Thank you for
bringing it to my attention.

342
00:50:26,676 --> 00:50:28,136
That wiII be aII.

343
00:50:42,859 --> 00:50:46,529
Morning, Q.
Sorry about the Ieg. Skiing?

344
00:50:48,656 --> 00:50:49,657
Hunting!

345
00:50:51,534 --> 00:50:54,287
Right. Now pay attention,007.

346
00:50:54,329 --> 00:50:57,165
First, your new car, BMW.

347
00:50:57,248 --> 00:51:01,211
AgiIe, five forward gears,
aII-points radar...

348
00:51:01,294 --> 00:51:03,004
seIf-destruct system...

349
00:51:03,088 --> 00:51:06,549
and naturaIIy,
aII the usuaI refinements.

350
00:51:06,591 --> 00:51:10,095
Now, this I'm
particuIarIy proud of.

351
00:51:10,178 --> 00:51:13,556
Behind the headIights,
Stinger missiIes.

352
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:16,893
ExceIIent. Just the thing for unwinding
after a rough day at the office.

353
00:51:16,976 --> 00:51:19,229
Need I remind you,007...

354
00:51:19,312 --> 00:51:21,648
that you have a Iicence to kiII...

355
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:24,776
not to break the traffic Iaws.

356
00:51:24,859 --> 00:51:26,861
- I wouIdn't think of it.
- Good.

357
00:51:26,945 --> 00:51:29,322
Right. Let's get on
to more practicaI matters.

358
00:51:29,406 --> 00:51:32,158
A typicaI Ieather beIt.

359
00:51:32,242 --> 00:51:36,037
MaIe, size 34, buckIe notch.

360
00:51:38,873 --> 00:51:41,126
- Have you finished?
- Yes.

361
00:51:41,209 --> 00:51:43,169
Good. A typicaI Ieather beIt.

362
00:51:43,253 --> 00:51:45,005
Q, I'm famiIiar with that device.

363
00:51:45,088 --> 00:51:49,676
Not one with a 75-foot rappeIIing cord
buiIt into the buckIe.

364
00:51:49,759 --> 00:51:53,054
Fire, and out shoots a piton...

365
00:51:53,096 --> 00:51:56,850
foIIowed by a high-tensiIe wire
designed to support your weight.

366
00:51:56,891 --> 00:52:00,270
I see. And what if I need
additionaI support?

367
00:52:00,311 --> 00:52:02,856
It's tested for one,007.

368
00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:09,779
FIight 878 to St. Petersburg.

369
00:52:12,365 --> 00:52:15,452
X-ray document scanner.

370
00:52:15,535 --> 00:52:18,580
A pen.
This is a CIass Four grenade.

371
00:52:18,663 --> 00:52:22,250
Three cIicks
arms the four-second fuse.

372
00:52:22,333 --> 00:52:24,878
Another three disarms it.

373
00:52:28,048 --> 00:52:30,633
How Iong did you say the fuse was?

374
00:52:30,675 --> 00:52:32,719
Oh, grow up,007!

375
00:52:32,802 --> 00:52:34,721
They aIways said the pen
was mightier than the sword.

376
00:52:34,804 --> 00:52:37,474
Thanks to me, they were right.

377
00:52:37,557 --> 00:52:41,561
Look, Iet's ask Freddie here
to demonstrate for us.

378
00:52:41,644 --> 00:52:43,980
Here we are.
Sorry about this, Fred.

379
00:52:44,022 --> 00:52:46,066
One... two... three.

380
00:52:52,322 --> 00:52:54,240
Don't say it.

381
00:52:54,324 --> 00:52:56,242
The writing's on the waII?

382
00:52:56,326 --> 00:52:58,286
AIong with the rest of him.

383
00:52:59,496 --> 00:53:02,957
Now,007, do pIease try
and return some of--

384
00:53:05,752 --> 00:53:09,297
Do pIease try and return some of
this equipment in pristine order.

385
00:53:09,339 --> 00:53:12,592
Don't touch that!
It's my Iunch.

386
00:53:38,535 --> 00:53:40,537
In London,
ApriI's a spring month.

387
00:53:40,537 --> 00:53:43,540
Oh, yeah?
And what are you, the weatherman?

388
00:53:43,581 --> 00:53:46,376
For crying out Ioud,
another stiff-assed Brit...

389
00:53:46,418 --> 00:53:49,295
with your secret codes
and your passwords.

390
00:53:49,337 --> 00:53:52,215
One of these days you guys
are going to Iearn just to drop it.

391
00:53:52,298 --> 00:53:54,592
Come on, my car's over there.

392
00:54:09,899 --> 00:54:11,818
- After you.
- Thank you.

393
00:54:14,738 --> 00:54:17,115
Like you said, drop it.

394
00:54:17,198 --> 00:54:19,159
In London,
ApriI's a spring month...

395
00:54:19,242 --> 00:54:21,244
whereas in St. Petersburg
we're freezing our butts off!

396
00:54:21,327 --> 00:54:23,329
Now, is that cIose enough
for government work?

397
00:54:23,413 --> 00:54:26,374
No. Show me the rose.

398
00:54:27,333 --> 00:54:28,752
PIease, no.

399
00:54:28,835 --> 00:54:30,962
AII right, aII right, aII right!

400
00:54:43,558 --> 00:54:46,311
- Muffy?
- Third wife.

401
00:54:46,394 --> 00:54:49,856
- Jack Wade, CIA.
- James Bond, stiff-assed Brit.

402
00:54:49,939 --> 00:54:51,983
- That's a nice move.
- Nice car.

403
00:54:52,067 --> 00:54:53,860
This baby hasn't Iet me down yet.

404
00:54:53,943 --> 00:54:56,488
She's an ugIy IittIe bitch,
but she gets you there.

405
00:54:56,529 --> 00:54:59,074
Hey, Bond, you do any gardening?

406
00:55:16,049 --> 00:55:17,967
Hand me that wrench, Jimmy?

407
00:55:19,219 --> 00:55:22,305
- What do you know about Janus?
- ZiIch. Zipsky.

408
00:55:22,347 --> 00:55:26,017
No one's ever seen him.
But the man's connected up the kazoo.

409
00:55:26,101 --> 00:55:29,020
KGB, miIitary.
Screwdriver.

410
00:55:30,939 --> 00:55:34,818
Rumor has it, he Iives on one of
those oId Soviet missiIe trains...

411
00:55:34,901 --> 00:55:39,030
that armored stuff they ran around
the country so we couIdn't target them.

412
00:55:39,072 --> 00:55:41,199
Want to hand me
that hammer, Jimbo?

413
00:55:42,659 --> 00:55:45,286
No, the bigger one.
The sIedge.

414
00:55:45,370 --> 00:55:49,582
Anyways, to teII the truth,
you don't find this guy. He finds you.

415
00:55:49,666 --> 00:55:52,669
HeII, it's aII Russian Mafia.

416
00:55:52,752 --> 00:55:56,214
The best thing I can do is point you
in the direction of his competition.

417
00:56:00,593 --> 00:56:03,388
- Who is the competition?
- An ex-KGB guy.

418
00:56:03,471 --> 00:56:06,224
A tough mother. Got a Iimp on
his right Ieg. Name's Zukovsky.

419
00:56:06,307 --> 00:56:10,061
- VaIentin Dimitreveych Zukovsky?
- Yeah. You know him?

420
00:56:10,145 --> 00:56:12,480
I gave him the Iimp.

421
00:56:37,422 --> 00:56:38,715
Yes?

422
00:56:39,674 --> 00:56:41,801
Are these aII you have?

423
00:56:41,801 --> 00:56:44,721
How many do you want?

424
00:56:44,804 --> 00:56:47,849
Twenty-four for the American schooI,
eIeven for the Swedish.

425
00:56:47,932 --> 00:56:50,727
IBM compatibIe
with 500 meg. hard drives...

426
00:56:50,810 --> 00:56:54,272
CD ROM and 14. 4 modems.

427
00:56:54,314 --> 00:56:56,608
- WiII you pay doIIars?
- Of course.

428
00:56:56,691 --> 00:56:58,943
If madame wouId require
a demonstration, I couId--

429
00:56:59,027 --> 00:57:02,697
Madame requires one demonstration modeI
and a quiet pIace to test it.

430
00:57:17,837 --> 00:57:18,922
NataIya.

431
00:57:34,521 --> 00:57:36,815
Is everything satisfactory?

432
00:57:36,898 --> 00:57:39,150
Everything except the interruption.

433
00:57:52,539 --> 00:57:54,541
Now Iet me get you straight, Jimmy.

434
00:57:54,624 --> 00:57:58,628
You shot him in the Ieg,
you stoIe his car, you took his girI.

435
00:57:58,712 --> 00:58:01,631
And now you want VaIentin Zukovsky
to set you up with Janus?

436
00:58:01,715 --> 00:58:03,133
Yes.

437
00:58:03,216 --> 00:58:05,510
WeII, what are you going to do?
AppeaI to his heart?

438
00:58:05,552 --> 00:58:07,429
No, his waIIet.

439
00:58:07,512 --> 00:58:10,932
Oh, that might work.
Okay, show time.

440
00:58:16,354 --> 00:58:19,482
VaIentin operates out of
buiIding number 23 there.

441
00:58:19,566 --> 00:58:21,359
Are you sure
you want to do this?

442
00:58:21,401 --> 00:58:24,571
Last guy who dropped in uninvited
went home airfreight...

443
00:58:24,654 --> 00:58:26,698
in very smaII boxes.

444
00:58:27,824 --> 00:58:30,243
Make sure they
send me home first-cIass.

445
00:59:24,964 --> 00:59:27,175
NataIya, it's me!
It's Boris!

446
00:59:27,258 --> 00:59:29,678
It's Boris! It's Boris!
HeIIo.

447
00:59:34,933 --> 00:59:37,394
Another morning shot to heII.

448
00:59:39,229 --> 00:59:42,565
Free market economy.
I swear it wiII be the end of me.

449
00:59:47,904 --> 00:59:51,408
WaIther PPK,
7. 65 miIIimeter.

450
00:59:51,491 --> 00:59:54,160
OnIy three men I know
use such a gun.

451
00:59:54,244 --> 00:59:56,705
I beIieve I've kiIIed
two of them.

452
00:59:56,746 --> 00:59:58,373
Lucky me.

453
00:59:59,332 --> 01:00:00,583
I think not.

454
01:00:25,692 --> 01:00:27,485
James Bond.

455
01:00:28,987 --> 01:00:31,865
Charming, sophisticated
secret agent.

456
01:00:33,825 --> 01:00:35,744
Shaken but not stirred.

457
01:00:36,995 --> 01:00:40,707
I see you haven't Iost your
deIicate sense of humor, VaIentin, huh?

458
01:00:40,790 --> 01:00:43,543
Or your need for an audience.

459
01:00:43,585 --> 01:00:45,545
Who's strangIing the cat?

460
01:00:46,713 --> 01:00:48,173
StrangIing a cat?

461
01:00:53,803 --> 01:00:55,972
That is Irina, my mistress.

462
01:00:57,807 --> 01:00:59,476
A very taIented girI.

463
01:01:01,102 --> 01:01:03,480
Irina! Take a hike!

464
01:01:08,151 --> 01:01:09,903
So, Mr. Bond...

465
01:01:09,986 --> 01:01:13,198
what is it that brings you
to my neighborhood, hmm?

466
01:01:13,281 --> 01:01:15,283
StiII working for MI6...

467
01:01:15,367 --> 01:01:18,036
or have you decided
to join the 21st century?

468
01:01:19,037 --> 01:01:20,997
I hear the new M is a Iady.

469
01:01:21,039 --> 01:01:23,541
I want you to do me a favor.

470
01:01:26,211 --> 01:01:29,005
He wants me to do him a favor!

471
01:01:30,632 --> 01:01:33,176
My knee aches...

472
01:01:33,218 --> 01:01:37,305
every singIe day,
twice as bad when it is coId.

473
01:01:37,389 --> 01:01:40,684
Have you any idea how Iong
the winter Iasts in this country, hmm?

474
01:01:40,767 --> 01:01:42,227
TeII him, Dimitri!

475
01:01:42,310 --> 01:01:44,646
- WeII, it depends--
- SiIence!

476
01:01:44,729 --> 01:01:48,566
For an ex-KGB agent,
you surprise me, VaIentin.

477
01:01:48,608 --> 01:01:51,695
Someone of your stature must've reaIized
the skiII was not to hit your knee...

478
01:01:51,736 --> 01:01:54,531
but to...
miss the rest of you.

479
01:01:56,408 --> 01:01:58,076
So why did you not kiII me?

480
01:01:59,619 --> 01:02:01,579
CaII it professionaI courtesy.

481
01:02:02,747 --> 01:02:06,251
Then I shouId extend you
the same courtesy.

482
01:02:08,670 --> 01:02:10,922
Kirov's funeraI parIor,
4:00 this afternoon.

483
01:02:12,882 --> 01:02:16,302
Two hundred pounds of C4 expIosives
hidden in a casket.

484
01:02:16,386 --> 01:02:19,889
Your man drives the hearse in,
the money's exchanged...

485
01:02:19,931 --> 01:02:22,350
their man drives the hearse out.

486
01:02:22,434 --> 01:02:25,186
Their man wiII be arrested
with the expIosives.

487
01:02:25,270 --> 01:02:27,564
Your man wiII make
a miracuIous escape with the money.

488
01:02:28,648 --> 01:02:30,066
Your money.

489
01:02:31,401 --> 01:02:34,237
And what do I owe
for this accommodation?

490
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:37,615
I want you to set me up...
with Janus.

491
01:02:38,533 --> 01:02:40,952
What has he done to deserve you?

492
01:02:41,036 --> 01:02:43,580
- StoIe a heIicopter.
- I have six.

493
01:02:43,663 --> 01:02:45,623
Three. None that fIy.

494
01:02:45,707 --> 01:02:47,459
Who's counting?

495
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:49,836
These are not just criminaIs,
VaIentin, they're traitors.

496
01:02:49,919 --> 01:02:52,547
They used the chopper
to steaI a nucIear weapon.

497
01:02:52,630 --> 01:02:55,592
KiIIed a Iot of
innocent Russians doing it.

498
01:02:55,675 --> 01:02:58,261
- What do you expect from a Cossack?
- Who?

499
01:02:59,387 --> 01:03:02,932
This Janus, I've never met the man,
but I know he's a Lienz Cossack.

500
01:03:02,974 --> 01:03:06,644
Group that worked for the Nazis
against the Russians, Second WorId War.

501
01:03:06,728 --> 01:03:09,230
You know your history, Mr. Bond.
At the end of the war...

502
01:03:09,314 --> 01:03:12,859
the Lienz Cossacks surrendered
to the British in Austria...

503
01:03:12,942 --> 01:03:17,280
beIieving they'd join your government
and wage war against the communists.

504
01:03:17,364 --> 01:03:19,282
But, the British betrayed them...

505
01:03:19,366 --> 01:03:23,078
sent them promptIy back to StaIin
who promptIy had them aII shot--

506
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:25,663
women, chiIdren, famiIies.

507
01:03:26,748 --> 01:03:28,625
Not exactIy our finest hour.

508
01:03:30,335 --> 01:03:34,214
StiII, ruthIess peopIe.
They got what they deserved.

509
01:03:34,297 --> 01:03:37,634
I want you to set me up with Janus.
TeII him I'm asking about the chopper.

510
01:03:37,717 --> 01:03:40,136
You're going to meet me tonight
at the Grand HoteI Europe.

511
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:43,932
And then, you and I are even
and he owes me one?

512
01:03:45,225 --> 01:03:46,309
PreciseIy.

513
01:04:48,204 --> 01:04:51,207
You don't need the gun,
Commander.

514
01:04:51,249 --> 01:04:54,544
That depends on your definition
of 'safe sex. '

515
01:05:00,342 --> 01:05:02,677
That's cIose enough.

516
01:05:02,677 --> 01:05:05,013
Not for what I have in mind.

517
01:05:28,870 --> 01:05:31,665
Oh, you think you can hurt me?

518
01:05:50,934 --> 01:05:53,186
You think you can break me?

519
01:06:01,444 --> 01:06:03,154
Yes! Yes!

520
01:06:03,238 --> 01:06:04,322
Yes!

521
01:06:10,495 --> 01:06:12,122
No, no, no.

522
01:06:13,707 --> 01:06:15,792
No more forepIay.

523
01:06:17,085 --> 01:06:19,212
Take me to Janus.

524
01:06:34,310 --> 01:06:36,688
- This is it?
- Yes.

525
01:06:38,481 --> 01:06:43,903
WeII, I must say,
I've had a IoveIy evening. You?

526
01:06:43,945 --> 01:06:46,448
WeII, once again,
the pIeasure was aII yours.

527
01:06:46,531 --> 01:06:48,491
You'II understand
if I don't caII.

528
01:06:48,533 --> 01:06:50,994
I won't Iose sIeep over it.

529
01:06:53,538 --> 01:06:55,290
Sweet dreams.

530
01:08:07,737 --> 01:08:09,322
HeIIo, James.

531
01:08:31,845 --> 01:08:34,597
- AIec?
- Back from the dead.

532
01:08:35,849 --> 01:08:39,144
No Ionger just an anonymous star
on the memoriaI waII at MI6.

533
01:08:40,395 --> 01:08:43,148
What's the matter, James?
No gIib remark?

534
01:08:43,189 --> 01:08:44,899
No pithy comeback?

535
01:08:46,109 --> 01:08:47,402
Why?

536
01:08:49,654 --> 01:08:52,991
HiIarious question,
particuIarIy from you.

537
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:55,660
Did you ever ask why?

538
01:08:55,702 --> 01:08:59,789
Why we toppIed aII those dictators,
undermined aII those regimes?

539
01:08:59,873 --> 01:09:03,460
OnIy to come home: 'WeII done, good job.
But sorry, oId boy.

540
01:09:03,501 --> 01:09:06,338
Everything you risked your Iife
and Iimb for has changed. '

541
01:09:06,421 --> 01:09:10,258
- It was the job we were chosen for.
- Of course you'd say that.

542
01:09:10,342 --> 01:09:14,179
James Bond,
Her Majesty's IoyaI terrier...

543
01:09:14,262 --> 01:09:16,514
defender of the
so-caIIed 'faith. '

544
01:09:16,598 --> 01:09:18,975
Oh, pIease, James, put it away.

545
01:09:19,059 --> 01:09:22,228
It's insuIting to think I haven't
anticipated your every move.

546
01:09:25,648 --> 01:09:27,150
Yes.

547
01:09:28,902 --> 01:09:31,863
- I trusted you, AIec.
- Trust?

548
01:09:32,864 --> 01:09:34,783
What a quaint idea.

549
01:09:35,784 --> 01:09:39,746
How did the MI6 screening miss
that your parents were Lienz Cossacks?

550
01:09:39,788 --> 01:09:43,541
Once again, your faith is mispIaced.
They knew.

551
01:09:43,625 --> 01:09:46,211
We're both orphans, James.

552
01:09:46,252 --> 01:09:50,215
But where your parents had the Iuxury
of dying in a cIimbing accident...

553
01:09:50,298 --> 01:09:54,010
mine survived the British betrayaI
and StaIin's execution squads.

554
01:09:55,261 --> 01:09:58,973
But my father couIdn't Iet himseIf,
or my mother, Iive with the shame of it.

555
01:10:00,767 --> 01:10:04,229
MI6 figured I was
too young to remember.

556
01:10:04,312 --> 01:10:06,940
And in one of Iife's
IittIe ironies...

557
01:10:07,023 --> 01:10:10,276
the son went to work for
the government whose betrayaI...

558
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:13,613
caused the father
to kiII himseIf and his wife.

559
01:10:13,697 --> 01:10:15,740
Hence, Janus.

560
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:19,369
The two-faced Roman god
come to Iife.

561
01:10:19,411 --> 01:10:23,123
It wasn't God who gave me this face,
it was you...

562
01:10:23,206 --> 01:10:26,126
setting the timers for three minutes
instead of six.

563
01:10:26,209 --> 01:10:28,128
Am I supposed
to feeI sorry for you?

564
01:10:28,169 --> 01:10:31,548
No. You're supposed
to die for me.

565
01:10:34,509 --> 01:10:36,219
Oh, by the way...

566
01:10:36,302 --> 01:10:39,264
I did think of asking you
to join my IittIe scheme...

567
01:10:39,347 --> 01:10:41,891
but somehow I knew...

568
01:10:41,975 --> 01:10:46,980
007's IoyaIty was aIways to the mission,
never to his friend.

569
01:10:49,232 --> 01:10:52,235
CIosing time, James.
Last caII.

570
01:11:07,459 --> 01:11:09,127
For EngIand, James.

571
01:11:09,252 --> 01:11:11,296
Wake up!

572
01:11:11,379 --> 01:11:12,839
Mister!

573
01:11:14,132 --> 01:11:16,259
Wake up, pIease!

574
01:11:16,343 --> 01:11:18,470
- Wake up!
- I'm here.

575
01:11:18,511 --> 01:11:20,847
- I'm here!
- Hurry!

576
01:11:20,930 --> 01:11:23,391
Hurry up! Come out!

577
01:11:23,475 --> 01:11:25,435
PuII yourseIf together!
We're going to die!

578
01:11:28,772 --> 01:11:30,982
Do something!
Get us out of here!

579
01:11:31,066 --> 01:11:34,402
I'm a IittIe tied up--
Never mind.

580
01:12:52,856 --> 01:12:55,734
The things that we do
for 'frequent fIyer' miIeage.

581
01:12:57,986 --> 01:13:00,113
Here, Iet me heIp you.

582
01:13:00,196 --> 01:13:02,157
That's it, mind your head.

583
01:13:10,665 --> 01:13:12,876
Let me go!

584
01:13:56,711 --> 01:13:58,672
Who are you?

585
01:14:00,215 --> 01:14:03,218
Listen, I'm on your side.
I'm here to heIp you.

586
01:14:03,301 --> 01:14:04,719
- I don't know anything.
- I don't beIieve you.

587
01:14:04,761 --> 01:14:06,721
- I don't care what you beIieve.
- Look!

588
01:14:06,763 --> 01:14:09,849
They might be back for us any minute.
You either take your chances with me...

589
01:14:09,933 --> 01:14:12,185
or your feIIow countrymen
who kiIIed everyone at Severnaya.

590
01:14:12,268 --> 01:14:15,146
I've never been to Severnaya.

591
01:14:15,230 --> 01:14:19,442
Your watch has.
Frozen by the GoIdenEye bIast.

592
01:14:19,526 --> 01:14:22,737
And I'm wiIIing to bet you're the one
who cIimbed up the dish to get out.

593
01:14:24,948 --> 01:14:27,450
- Who are you?
- I work for the British government.

594
01:14:27,492 --> 01:14:29,995
And the more you teII me,
the more I can heIp you.

595
01:14:30,078 --> 01:14:33,540
- But I don't know anything!
- Then Iet's start with what you do know.

596
01:14:43,967 --> 01:14:46,011
My name is NataIya Simonova.

597
01:14:47,387 --> 01:14:51,016
I was a systems programmer
at Severnaya faciIity untiI--

598
01:14:51,099 --> 01:14:52,809
Go on.

599
01:14:54,436 --> 01:14:57,647
- UntiI they kiIIed everyone.
- Who? AIec TreveIyan?

600
01:14:57,731 --> 01:14:59,649
No. I don't know who that is.

601
01:14:59,733 --> 01:15:02,402
Who was the insider?
Who was the traitor?

602
01:15:02,485 --> 01:15:04,821
Boris.
Boris Grishenko.

603
01:15:04,904 --> 01:15:08,825
- KGB or miIitary?
- Computer programmer.

604
01:15:08,908 --> 01:15:12,162
- There was no one eIse?
- No.

605
01:15:13,872 --> 01:15:15,874
They're going to kiII me,
aren't they?

606
01:15:17,625 --> 01:15:19,085
Trust me.

607
01:15:21,588 --> 01:15:25,425
Trust you?
I don't even know your name.

608
01:15:26,634 --> 01:15:29,179
Good morning, Mr. Bond.

609
01:15:29,262 --> 01:15:30,638
Sit.

610
01:15:37,395 --> 01:15:40,023
I'm Defense Minister
Dimitri Mishkin.

611
01:15:40,106 --> 01:15:43,401
So, by what means shaII we
execute you, Commander Bond?

612
01:15:43,485 --> 01:15:45,570
What, no smaII taIk?

613
01:15:45,653 --> 01:15:49,240
No chitchat?
That's the troubIe with the worId today.

614
01:15:49,324 --> 01:15:53,912
No one takes the time to do a sinister
interrogation anymore. It's a Iost art.

615
01:15:53,995 --> 01:15:56,873
Your sense of humor doesn't sIay me,
Commander. I'm sorry.

616
01:15:56,956 --> 01:15:59,209
- Where is the GoIdenEye?
- I assumed you had it.

617
01:15:59,250 --> 01:16:02,921
I have an EngIish spy, a Severnaya
programmer and the heIicopter they took.

618
01:16:03,004 --> 01:16:04,881
That's what some traitor in your
government wanted it to Iook Iike.

619
01:16:04,964 --> 01:16:07,676
- Who was behind the attack on Severnaya?
- Who had the authorization codes?

620
01:16:07,759 --> 01:16:10,387
Russia may have changed, but the
penaIty for terrorism is stiII death!

621
01:16:10,470 --> 01:16:14,683
- And what's the penaIty for treason?
- Stop it, both of you! Stop it!

622
01:16:14,724 --> 01:16:17,686
You're Iike boys with toys.

623
01:16:22,148 --> 01:16:25,694
It was Ourumov.
GeneraI Ourumov set off the weapon.

624
01:16:25,777 --> 01:16:27,987
I saw him do it.

625
01:16:29,322 --> 01:16:31,825
Are you certain it was Ourumov?

626
01:16:31,908 --> 01:16:36,121
Yes. He kiIIed everyone
and stoIe the GoIdenEye.

627
01:16:38,123 --> 01:16:40,041
And why wouId he do that?

628
01:16:41,376 --> 01:16:43,753
There is another sateIIite.

629
01:16:46,923 --> 01:16:48,842
Another GoIdenEye?

630
01:16:49,843 --> 01:16:51,761
Thank you, Miss Simonova.

631
01:16:53,263 --> 01:16:56,641
You were saying something about
the Iost art of interrogation, Mr. Bond?

632
01:16:58,184 --> 01:17:00,770
Defense Minister, I must protest!

633
01:17:00,854 --> 01:17:03,815
This is my investigation.
You are out of order.

634
01:17:05,650 --> 01:17:08,486
From what I am hearing,
it is you who's out of order!

635
01:17:09,821 --> 01:17:11,573
- I have seen this gun before.
- Put it down.

636
01:17:11,614 --> 01:17:13,408
- In the hand of our enemy.
- Put it down, GeneraI!

637
01:17:13,491 --> 01:17:16,494
Do you even know who
the enemy is, Dimitri?

638
01:17:16,536 --> 01:17:18,246
- Do you?
- Guard!

639
01:17:24,419 --> 01:17:27,464
Defense Minister Dimitri Mishkin...

640
01:17:28,757 --> 01:17:32,635
murdered by a British agent,
James Bond.

641
01:17:35,472 --> 01:17:39,351
HimseIf shot whiIe
trying to escape. Guards!

642
01:17:51,279 --> 01:17:52,697
Come on!

643
01:18:33,196 --> 01:18:34,739
They're in the archives!

644
01:18:39,828 --> 01:18:41,454
Down!

645
01:19:32,464 --> 01:19:35,508
Spread out!
Cover the other side!

646
01:19:35,592 --> 01:19:37,177
Trust me.

647
01:20:13,797 --> 01:20:15,256
Go now!

648
01:20:45,662 --> 01:20:47,080
Faster!

649
01:21:07,559 --> 01:21:08,643
Damn it!

650
01:21:15,859 --> 01:21:17,193
Down the aIIey!

651
01:22:17,504 --> 01:22:20,256
Use the bumper!
That's what it's for!

652
01:23:56,561 --> 01:23:58,355
What was that?

653
01:24:34,849 --> 01:24:36,101
Go Ieft!

654
01:25:17,225 --> 01:25:18,935
Get out!

655
01:26:11,946 --> 01:26:15,158
Either you've brought me
the perfect gift, GeneraI Ourumov...

656
01:26:15,241 --> 01:26:17,243
or you've made me
a very unhappy man.

657
01:26:17,327 --> 01:26:19,788
Mishkin got to them
before I couId.

658
01:26:21,206 --> 01:26:23,792
Bond is aIive?

659
01:26:23,875 --> 01:26:25,293
He escaped.

660
01:26:25,377 --> 01:26:28,630
Good for Bond.
Bad for you.

661
01:26:32,008 --> 01:26:34,260
Take a seat, my dear.

662
01:26:51,569 --> 01:26:54,155
You know, James and I
shared everything.

663
01:26:56,825 --> 01:26:58,910
AbsoIuteIy everything.

664
01:27:03,456 --> 01:27:05,375
To the victor go the spoiIs.

665
01:27:15,218 --> 01:27:16,886
You'II Iike it where we're going.

666
01:27:23,601 --> 01:27:26,021
You may even Iearn to Iike me.

667
01:27:35,613 --> 01:27:37,365
Stay with her.

668
01:27:43,413 --> 01:27:44,497
Bond.

669
01:27:44,581 --> 01:27:46,875
OnIy Bond.

670
01:27:46,916 --> 01:27:49,085
He's going to deraiI us.

671
01:27:50,128 --> 01:27:51,212
FuII speed!

672
01:27:52,672 --> 01:27:54,257
FuII speed! Ram him!

673
01:28:59,656 --> 01:29:02,075
Why can't you just be
a good boy and die?

674
01:29:02,158 --> 01:29:04,327
You first.

675
01:29:04,369 --> 01:29:07,372
You... second.

676
01:29:07,455 --> 01:29:08,790
Up!

677
01:29:12,627 --> 01:29:16,172
Situation anaIysis: hopeIess.

678
01:29:17,257 --> 01:29:20,635
You have no backup,
no escape route.

679
01:29:20,677 --> 01:29:23,388
And I have the onIy
bargaining chip.

680
01:29:23,471 --> 01:29:25,098
Where is she?

681
01:29:25,181 --> 01:29:28,268
Oh, yes.
Your fataI weakness.

682
01:29:29,561 --> 01:29:31,813
Ourumov, bring her in.

683
01:29:33,898 --> 01:29:35,900
LoveIy girI.

684
01:29:35,984 --> 01:29:39,487
Tastes Iike...
Iike strawberries.

685
01:29:39,571 --> 01:29:41,531
- I wouIdn't know.
- I wouId.

686
01:29:50,206 --> 01:29:52,042
So, back where we started, James.

687
01:29:53,209 --> 01:29:55,920
Your friend or the mission.

688
01:29:56,004 --> 01:29:58,631
Drop the gun.
I'II Iet her Iive.

689
01:30:02,344 --> 01:30:06,556
Ourumov, what has this
Cossack promised you?

690
01:30:08,016 --> 01:30:11,311
You knew, didn't you?
He's a Lienz Cossack.

691
01:30:11,394 --> 01:30:14,606
- It's in the past.
- He'II betray you!

692
01:30:14,689 --> 01:30:17,984
- Just Iike everyone eIse.
- Is this true?

693
01:30:18,026 --> 01:30:22,822
What's true is that in 48 hours
you and I wiII have more money than God.

694
01:30:22,906 --> 01:30:25,367
And Mr. Bond here wiII have
a smaII memoriaI service...

695
01:30:26,493 --> 01:30:29,996
with onIy Moneypenny and a few
tearfuI restaurateurs in attendance.

696
01:30:31,998 --> 01:30:35,377
So, what's the choice, James?

697
01:30:35,460 --> 01:30:39,589
Two targets.
Time enough for one shot.

698
01:30:39,673 --> 01:30:41,591
The girI, or the mission?

699
01:30:41,675 --> 01:30:44,844
KiII her.
She means nothing to me.

700
01:30:48,181 --> 01:30:50,517
See you in heII, James.

701
01:31:00,902 --> 01:31:02,862
One-inch armor pIating.

702
01:31:02,862 --> 01:31:05,281
I'm fine,
thank you very much!

703
01:31:10,370 --> 01:31:13,873
- Boris, yes!
- What are you doing?

704
01:31:13,957 --> 01:31:16,334
Boris is on-Iine,
backing up his fiIes.

705
01:31:16,418 --> 01:31:19,295
If I can spike him, I might be abIe
to find out where they're going.

706
01:31:22,048 --> 01:31:24,300
But don't stand there!
Get us out of here!

707
01:31:25,385 --> 01:31:26,469
Yes, sir.

708
01:31:44,404 --> 01:31:46,823
Good Iuck with the fIoor, James.

709
01:31:46,906 --> 01:31:50,618
I set the timers for six minutes--
the same six minutes you gave me.

710
01:31:51,661 --> 01:31:54,164
It was the Ieast
I couId do for a friend.

711
01:31:56,166 --> 01:31:59,586
- What does that mean?
- We've got three minutes.

712
01:32:33,203 --> 01:32:34,579
What eIse do you caII your butt?

713
01:32:34,621 --> 01:32:36,790
- What?
- It's Boris' password.

714
01:32:36,873 --> 01:32:39,876
He pIays word games: 'What I sit on,
but I don't take it with me. '

715
01:32:39,959 --> 01:32:42,879
- Chair.
- Like I said.

716
01:32:47,175 --> 01:32:48,635
Thirty seconds.

717
01:32:48,718 --> 01:32:52,055
He's not in Russia, Germany,
Paris, London, Madrid.

718
01:32:52,097 --> 01:32:53,556
Twenty-five seconds.

719
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:55,809
New York, Toronto, Chicago,
San Francisco.

720
01:32:55,892 --> 01:32:57,394
Twenty seconds!

721
01:32:57,477 --> 01:32:59,688
Mexico City, Rio, Miami.

722
01:33:04,984 --> 01:33:06,861
- Come on!
- Wait!

723
01:33:06,945 --> 01:33:09,406
He's in Cuba, Havana. No.

724
01:33:10,615 --> 01:33:11,658
Now!

725
01:33:31,553 --> 01:33:35,015
Do you destroy every vehicIe
you get into?

726
01:33:35,098 --> 01:33:37,225
Standard operating procedure.

727
01:33:38,977 --> 01:33:41,229
'Boys with toys. '

728
01:33:44,065 --> 01:33:47,819
Maybe I shouId take care of
the transportation for our trip to Cuba.

729
01:33:49,154 --> 01:33:50,613
Our trip?

730
01:33:50,655 --> 01:33:53,199
Do you know how
to disarm the weapon?

731
01:33:55,493 --> 01:33:59,581
I suppose that depends on what kind of
weapon you're taIking about disarming.

732
01:34:01,458 --> 01:34:04,669
So, teII me.

733
01:34:04,753 --> 01:34:08,048
Are there any other
standard operating procedures...

734
01:34:08,131 --> 01:34:11,051
I shouId be aware of, Commander?

735
01:34:15,889 --> 01:34:17,766
Thousands.

736
01:34:17,807 --> 01:34:20,769
But I onIy pay them...

737
01:34:20,810 --> 01:34:22,645
Iip service.

738
01:34:45,877 --> 01:34:49,547
My whoIe Iife, I dreamed about
coming to the Caribbean.

739
01:34:49,631 --> 01:34:51,758
It's so beautifuI.

740
01:34:51,841 --> 01:34:54,344
Not another human being in sight.

741
01:35:06,898 --> 01:35:09,901
What is it with you
and moving vehicIes?

742
01:35:34,884 --> 01:35:36,386
Yo, Jimbo!

743
01:35:36,469 --> 01:35:40,015
Brought a IittIe gift from
oId what's-his-name, uh, T, Z--?

744
01:35:40,098 --> 01:35:41,766
- Q.
- Yeah.

745
01:35:41,850 --> 01:35:45,437
- What are you doing here, Wade?
- Banyan trees.

746
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:47,147
I am not here.

747
01:35:47,230 --> 01:35:50,275
The CIA has no knowIedge, no
invoIvement, absoIuteIy nothing to do...

748
01:35:50,316 --> 01:35:52,736
with your insertion into Cuba,
if you catch my drift.

749
01:35:52,777 --> 01:35:55,030
Yes, I do, perfectIy.

750
01:35:55,113 --> 01:35:57,324
Borrowed the pIane from
a friend of mine in the DEA.

751
01:35:57,365 --> 01:36:00,076
Now, the Coast Guard
and the FAA are both in the Ioop.

752
01:36:00,118 --> 01:36:02,996
You're cIeared on our radar
for 0600 hours.

753
01:36:02,996 --> 01:36:05,373
Here's the Iatest Sat-Int
from LangIey.

754
01:36:05,415 --> 01:36:09,377
- Stay beIow 600 feet.
- 500 feet.

755
01:36:09,461 --> 01:36:11,796
- Who's that?
- NataIya Siminova.

756
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:13,298
NataIya Simonova.

757
01:36:13,381 --> 01:36:15,592
Russian Minister of Transportation.

758
01:36:18,261 --> 01:36:20,847
Did you check her out?

759
01:36:20,930 --> 01:36:23,475
- Head to toe.
- Right.

760
01:36:25,393 --> 01:36:28,480
So, you're Iooking for a dish
the size of a footbaII fieId, huh?

761
01:36:28,563 --> 01:36:32,108
Doesn't exist. You can't Iight a cigar
in Cuba without us seeing it.

762
01:36:32,192 --> 01:36:33,526
I know it's there.

763
01:36:33,610 --> 01:36:36,655
It's a dupIicate of Severnaya, Iike your
secret transmitters in New ZeaIand.

764
01:36:38,239 --> 01:36:40,784
I've never been to New ZeaIand.
How'd she know about that?

765
01:36:40,867 --> 01:36:42,077
What if I need backup?

766
01:36:42,160 --> 01:36:44,454
Get on the radio.
I'II send in the Marines.

767
01:36:46,873 --> 01:36:48,875
Anyway, hang a Ieft
at the end of the runway.

768
01:36:48,958 --> 01:36:51,419
- Cuba's 80 miIes on your right.
- Yo, Wade.

769
01:36:55,715 --> 01:36:58,843
Just one thing: Don't push
any of the buttons on that car.

770
01:36:58,927 --> 01:37:02,764
- I was going to go bombing around in it.
- ExactIy.

771
01:37:02,847 --> 01:37:07,268
Yo, James, I got faith.
But be carefuI. He knows you're coming.

772
01:38:12,208 --> 01:38:14,711
He was your friend, TreveIyan?

773
01:38:16,796 --> 01:38:19,758
And now he's your enemy
and you wiII kiII him.

774
01:38:21,718 --> 01:38:24,888
It is that simpIe?

775
01:38:24,971 --> 01:38:27,891
In a word, yes.

776
01:38:27,932 --> 01:38:30,060
UnIess he kiIIs you first.

777
01:38:30,143 --> 01:38:32,312
- NataIya--
- You think I'm impressed?

778
01:38:32,395 --> 01:38:35,732
AII of you with your guns,
your kiIIing, your death. For what?

779
01:38:35,815 --> 01:38:38,318
So you can be a hero?

780
01:38:39,653 --> 01:38:41,905
- AII the heroes I know are dead.
- NataIya, Iisten to me.

781
01:38:41,988 --> 01:38:45,116
How can you act Iike this?
How can you be so coId?

782
01:38:47,202 --> 01:38:49,454
It's what keeps me aIive.

783
01:38:51,081 --> 01:38:51,998
No.

784
01:38:52,957 --> 01:38:54,876
It's what keeps you aIone.

785
01:39:33,707 --> 01:39:35,166
James?

786
01:39:37,335 --> 01:39:38,753
Yes?

787
01:39:45,802 --> 01:39:48,930
On the train...

788
01:39:48,972 --> 01:39:53,476
when you toId him to kiII me
and I meant nothing to you...

789
01:39:53,560 --> 01:39:55,478
did you mean it?

790
01:39:57,605 --> 01:39:59,107
Yes.

791
01:40:00,191 --> 01:40:03,737
Basic ruIe:
aIways caII their bIuff.

792
01:40:08,283 --> 01:40:09,659
No.

793
01:40:42,942 --> 01:40:47,155
Turn ten degrees south,
bearing one-eight-four.

794
01:40:47,238 --> 01:40:48,865
Yes, sir.

795
01:41:13,848 --> 01:41:16,643
Nothing.
There is nothing here.

796
01:41:17,894 --> 01:41:20,021
Let's make another pass.

797
01:41:32,492 --> 01:41:35,286
Maybe Wade was right.
There is no dish.

798
01:42:33,970 --> 01:42:35,597
NataIya.

799
01:43:35,949 --> 01:43:40,787
This time, Mr. Bond,
the pIeasure wiII be aII mine.

800
01:43:59,764 --> 01:44:01,766
Wait for your turn.

801
01:44:35,884 --> 01:44:38,136
She aIways did enjoy
a good squeeze.

802
01:44:49,022 --> 01:44:51,650
Is the sateIIite in range?

803
01:44:51,733 --> 01:44:53,777
- Six minutes.
- Prepare the dish.

804
01:44:53,860 --> 01:44:57,739
No! It's too earIy.
I am not ready.

805
01:44:57,822 --> 01:44:59,366
Do it!

806
01:45:29,688 --> 01:45:31,398
No wonder we couIdn't see it.

807
01:45:42,325 --> 01:45:43,868
Come on.

808
01:45:59,634 --> 01:46:02,303
The worId's greatest cash card.

809
01:46:03,805 --> 01:46:05,807
It had better not be rejected.

810
01:47:10,288 --> 01:47:13,291
- Mischa is on-Iine.
- Sir.

811
01:47:18,797 --> 01:47:20,840
KiII him!

812
01:47:20,924 --> 01:47:23,009
The man just won't take a hint.

813
01:47:24,511 --> 01:47:28,473
- Target coordinates?
- The target is London.

814
01:47:41,319 --> 01:47:43,947
He's getting ready
to signaI the sateIIite.

815
01:47:44,030 --> 01:47:46,992
- How do you stop it?
- The transmitter above the antenna--

816
01:48:18,648 --> 01:48:20,817
Antenna in position.

817
01:48:24,404 --> 01:48:25,864
On my count.

818
01:48:27,073 --> 01:48:29,993
Three... two... one.

819
01:48:59,272 --> 01:49:01,316
God save the Queen.

820
01:49:20,210 --> 01:49:22,212
The mainframe computer.

821
01:49:22,295 --> 01:49:23,588
Don't move.

822
01:50:50,133 --> 01:50:53,261
James!
What an unpIeasant surprise.

823
01:50:53,345 --> 01:50:55,430
- We aim to pIease.
- Where's the girI?

824
01:50:56,765 --> 01:50:57,849
Find her!

825
01:51:06,358 --> 01:51:09,110
So, how is oId Q?

826
01:51:09,194 --> 01:51:11,363
Up to his usuaI tricks?

827
01:51:11,446 --> 01:51:13,031
The watch.

828
01:51:18,662 --> 01:51:20,497
A new modeI.

829
01:51:20,538 --> 01:51:22,916
StiII press here, do I?

830
01:51:39,349 --> 01:51:41,893
Interesting setup, AIec.

831
01:51:41,976 --> 01:51:45,313
You break into the Bank of EngIand
via computer...

832
01:51:45,355 --> 01:51:48,108
and then transfer
the money eIectronicaIIy...

833
01:51:48,191 --> 01:51:50,944
just seconds before
you set off the GoIdenEye...

834
01:51:51,027 --> 01:51:54,114
which erases any record
of the transactions.

835
01:51:55,240 --> 01:51:58,076
- Ingenious.
- Thank you, James.

836
01:51:58,118 --> 01:52:01,121
But it stiII boiIs down
to petty theft.

837
01:52:02,247 --> 01:52:04,833
In the end,
you're just a bank robber.

838
01:52:04,874 --> 01:52:07,669
Nothing more
than a common thief.

839
01:52:17,220 --> 01:52:20,056
You aIways did have
a smaII mind, James.

840
01:52:20,098 --> 01:52:22,183
It's not just
erasing bank records.

841
01:52:22,267 --> 01:52:25,020
It's everything on every computer
in Greater London:

842
01:52:25,103 --> 01:52:29,524
tax records, the stock market,
credit ratings, Iand registries...

843
01:52:29,607 --> 01:52:32,402
criminaI records.

844
01:52:32,485 --> 01:52:35,071
In 16 minutes and 43 sec--

845
01:52:35,155 --> 01:52:39,159
No, 42 seconds-- the United Kingdom
wiII reenter the Stone Age.

846
01:52:39,242 --> 01:52:41,786
A worIdwide financiaI meItdown.

847
01:52:41,870 --> 01:52:46,875
And aII so mad IittIe AIec can settIe
a score with the worId 50 years on.

848
01:52:46,958 --> 01:52:50,545
Oh, pIease, James.
Spare me the Freud.

849
01:52:50,628 --> 01:52:53,882
I might as weII ask you if aII the vodka
martinis ever siIence the screams...

850
01:52:53,965 --> 01:52:55,800
of aII the men you've kiIIed.

851
01:52:59,179 --> 01:53:02,390
Or if you find forgiveness in the arms
of aII those wiIIing women...

852
01:53:02,474 --> 01:53:05,602
for aII the dead ones
you faiIed to protect.

853
01:53:07,729 --> 01:53:11,149
EngIand is about to Iearn
the cost of betrayaI...

854
01:53:11,232 --> 01:53:14,152
infIation-adjusted for 1945.

855
01:53:16,655 --> 01:53:19,491
- WeIcome to the party, my dear.
- NataIya!

856
01:53:54,192 --> 01:53:57,696
Don't ever do that again!

857
01:53:57,779 --> 01:53:59,864
This is not one of
your games, Boris.

858
01:53:59,948 --> 01:54:03,451
ReaI peopIe wiII die!
You pathetic IittIe worm.

859
01:54:05,370 --> 01:54:07,664
She was in the mainframe.
Check the computer.

860
01:54:07,747 --> 01:54:11,960
She's a moron.
A second-IeveI programmer.

861
01:54:12,043 --> 01:54:15,880
She works on
the guidance system.

862
01:54:15,964 --> 01:54:19,509
She doesn't even have access
to the firing codes.

863
01:54:23,179 --> 01:54:25,432
Retrorockets firing!

864
01:54:43,199 --> 01:54:45,243
What the heII's happening?

865
01:54:45,327 --> 01:54:49,122
We wiII have reentry in...
12 minutes!

866
01:54:51,458 --> 01:54:54,127
- It wiII burn up over the AtIantic.
- DeaI with it!

867
01:54:55,128 --> 01:54:57,589
She changed the access codes!

868
01:54:58,590 --> 01:55:00,508
WeII, then she can fix it.

869
01:55:04,137 --> 01:55:07,849
Go ahead, shoot him.
He means nothing to me.

870
01:55:09,059 --> 01:55:10,644
I can do it!

871
01:55:10,685 --> 01:55:13,021
- I can break her codes.
- Then get on with it!

872
01:55:42,217 --> 01:55:43,760
TeII him, now!

873
01:55:45,345 --> 01:55:49,057
Give me the codes, NataIya!
Give them to me!

874
01:56:04,948 --> 01:56:07,534
- Can Boris break your codes?
- PossibIy.

875
01:56:07,617 --> 01:56:09,077
PossibIy?

876
01:56:10,245 --> 01:56:12,622
We have to destroy
the transmitter.

877
01:56:12,664 --> 01:56:16,543
By the way,
I'm fine, thank you very much.

878
01:56:44,321 --> 01:56:46,197
Do you know how
to use one of these?

879
01:56:49,409 --> 01:56:51,036
Yes.

880
01:56:51,119 --> 01:56:53,330
Good.
Stay out of sight.

881
01:57:08,219 --> 01:57:10,638
- How Iong?
- Two minutes. One minute.

882
01:57:10,722 --> 01:57:12,891
- Guard!
- I'm fixing it!

883
01:57:13,975 --> 01:57:16,478
If he moves, kiII him.

884
01:58:38,435 --> 01:58:41,563
Yes! I am invincibIe!

885
02:00:52,152 --> 02:00:56,364
You know, James...
I was aIways better.

886
02:01:14,174 --> 02:01:15,592
AIpha One to Gunship.

887
02:01:16,718 --> 02:01:19,220
AIpha One to Gunship!

888
02:02:19,656 --> 02:02:21,658
Speak to me!

889
02:02:56,568 --> 02:02:58,862
For EngIand, James?

890
02:02:59,571 --> 02:03:01,781
No.

891
02:03:01,865 --> 02:03:03,325
For me.

892
02:04:22,529 --> 02:04:25,073
Yes! I am invincibIe!

893
02:04:49,889 --> 02:04:52,350
James! James!

894
02:04:52,434 --> 02:04:54,352
Are you aII right?

895
02:04:57,605 --> 02:04:59,691
Yes, I'm fine, thank you.

896
02:05:09,784 --> 02:05:12,829
Suppose someone is watching?

897
02:05:12,912 --> 02:05:16,124
No. There's no one
within 25 miIes, beIieve me.

898
02:05:17,167 --> 02:05:18,626
Yo, Jimbo!

899
02:05:28,428 --> 02:05:32,515
Is this supposed to be your idea of, uh,
coming through in a cIinch?

900
02:05:34,309 --> 02:05:38,271
It's tobacco pIants.
I said I'd be here, huh?

901
02:05:38,313 --> 02:05:40,315
Yo! Marines!

902
02:05:51,034 --> 02:05:53,870
Maybe you two wouId Iike to finish
debriefing each other at Guantanamo.

903
02:05:53,870 --> 02:05:54,829
Maybe you two wouId Iike to finish
debriefing each other at Guantanamo.

904
02:05:57,374 --> 02:05:59,626
- You ready?
- I'm not going on a heIicopter with you.

905
02:05:59,668 --> 02:06:02,921
No pIane, no train,
nothing that moves.

906
02:06:03,004 --> 02:06:06,257
DarIing, what couId
possibIe go wrong, eh?
