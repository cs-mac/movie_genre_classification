00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:55,733
- How you doing there, buddy?

5
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:03,531
See, that feels good,
doesn't it, huh?

6
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:14,609
All right, well,
I'm off to the office.

7
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:20,617
To start off,
are there any of you

8
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:22,024
that have
any particular problems

9
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:23,891
you'd like to tell me about?

10
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,897
Don't be bashful.
You're among friends.

11
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:29,366
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

12
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:31,335
- Let him be,
'cause he's learning

13
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:33,337
how to kind of settle in
with you.

14
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,568
A lot of times,
rather than helping people

15
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:38,974
with horse problems,

16
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:42,377
I'm helping horses
with people problems.

17
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:43,779
And for a lot of people,

18
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:46,374
they want it all to be fuzzy
and warm and cosmic,

19
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:49,250
but it is no different
with a horse than with a kid.

20
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,721
You can't always be
the kid's best friend.

21
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:54,122
First you have to be the parent.

22
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:56,492
A horse like this
isn't any different

23
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:58,996
than a kid that takes
everybody's milk money

24
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:01,931
on the way to school,
beats up old people.

25
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,161
Maybe it isn't the kid's fault.

26
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:04,930
Maybe the parent
ought to be in jail.

27
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,461
- Boy, do you feel like a fool
and kind of like a failure.

28
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:09,030
You know?
- Aw, it's all right.

29
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:10,769
People bring a lot of baggage
to the table

30
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,140
when they come to these.

31
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:14,236
Sometimes they're here
for a different reason

32
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:15,541
other than just
getting to where

33
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:16,842
they can ride their horse
a little bit better.

34
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:23,851
If you find a way
to fit this thing right here,

35
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:26,357
it'll make you better.

36
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:27,653
It'll make you better in areas

37
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,217
that you didn't think
related to horses.

38
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,873
Good job, buddy.

39
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:48,708
Horses are my life,

40
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:50,305
and because of some
of the things

41
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,838
I've been through as a kid,

42
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:53,407
I found some safety

43
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:56,579
and some companionship
in the horses.

44
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:59,886
I was just looking for kind of
a peaceful place to be

45
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:02,860
where I wasn't threatened,
where my life wasn't threatened.

46
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:05,988
So I have an empathy for horses

47
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,228
that when something
is scared for their life,

48
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:11,292
I understand that.

49
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,104
He's a pretty nice horse,
six years old.

50
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:17,404
Making some good progress,
anyway.

51
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,239
Just a youngster,
just telling him-

52
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:20,835
I want him to be aware of me.

53
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:24,007
If I slow down,
I want him to slow down.

54
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,813
See, if I go like this-

55
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,648
I have to practice
my old man walk.

56
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:29,881
So when I'm really old,

57
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:32,389
it might take me an hour
to get over there.

58
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:34,050
He ought to be able
to just go with me,

59
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,526
as slow as I want to go,
and not crowd me.

60
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,961
Might be a little slower
than what he'd like to go.

61
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:41,090
If I stop, he ought to stop.

62
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,067
If I go back,
he ought to go back,

63
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,400
and I ought not to have
to beg him.

64
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:49,100
Right now, I walk
at a little faster pace,

65
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:52,803
but I'm always testing him
to see if he's with me.

66
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:57,238
- When I first seen him,
I thought,

67
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,410
"What kind of voodoo stuff
is this, you know?

68
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,181
How are you getting this done,
you know?"

69
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,154
He walks into around pen.

70
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:06,316
In five minutes, he's got
a horse following him around

71
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:07,484
like a dog

72
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:09,254
- He and I go together.

73
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:11,956
- Most of us have
a bag of tricks,

74
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:15,558
and Buck has an arsenal.

75
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:32,282
- Hey, boys.

76
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:33,340
- Morning.

77
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:34,613
- Hello, how you doing?

78
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:35,915
- Good.
- Good.

79
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,216
Colt starting
is always interesting

80
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:43,659
because most of the youngsters
have never been saddled,

81
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:47,130
never had anyone on their back
or a bit in their mouth.

82
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:50,657
So there is a lot of fear
in both the horse and the human.

83
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:55,300
The way I do these colt classes,
you guys,

84
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:57,274
you'll have to get them exposed
to a lot of things

85
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,299
that seem perfectly normal
to you,

86
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:02,006
but it doesn't seem normal
to the horse.

87
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:05,573
You walk up to them smelling
like a Big Mac, you know,

88
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:09,075
or something...

[horse neighing]

90
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,258
Your diet is gonna make you
smell different to the horse,

91
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,487
and then you're gonna
tell the horse,

92
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:20,191
"Don't worry.
I want to crawl on you..."

93

[laughter]

94
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:25,595
In a similar posture
to how a lion would attack

95
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:26,660
and kill a horse.

96
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,229
They jump right up
in the middle of them,

97
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:29,899
and they reach
their front claws around,

98
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:32,466
and as they're biting down
on their spine,

99
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,342
they're cutting their throat
with their claws.

100
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:37,507
You're asking the horse
to let you be in that posture

101
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:39,016
and crawl on him.

102
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:42,417
And then about the time
he says, "All right, maybe,"

103
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:45,423
and then you say,
"Oh, oh, one more thing.

104
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:50,019
"I want to strap some hides
of other dead animals around you

105
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:53,189
before I crawl on you."

106
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:55,665
You damn sure have to have
some trust.

107
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,998
He's got to believe in you
to let you do that,

108
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,436
and amazingly enough,
they'll let you do it.

109
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,274
Now, the first thing
that I'm gonna show you

110
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:12,510
is leading the horse by.

111
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,212
Step in here.
Extend the front over like that.

112
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:18,688
Then he'll go on forward
around me.

113
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,783
This takes some practice
to get good at.

114
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:26,596
Your horse might be afraid
to move.

115
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,656
It's a real trust thing
between the two of you.

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,538
What's your name, dear?

Martha?

118
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:38,740
Okay, Martha, you want to go
the other way.

119
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:40,073
You got your horse
leading by good,

120
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:41,134
just the wrong direction.

121
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,373
That's all right.

122
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,472
Tap her.

123
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:45,005
Don't be afraid of tapping her
with that flag.

124
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:46,141
You aren't gonna hurt her.

125
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:48,709
It would be like you
getting spanked with a sock.

Dave, lead with the right hand.

Yeah, it's in your left hand.

The other left.

Walk to the hip.

00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,063
No, walk to the hip.

132
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:05,729
You're at the head.
That's the eating end.

This is always a hard one

Pam, that walking on you.

136
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:14,003
Now, your horse
is kind of naughty.

137
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:17,207
You guys make a big old circle
around me.

138
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:24,113
This horse,
it knows to get away,

139
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:27,818
'cause she's pretty fearful.

140
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:29,952
No, you won't get away.

141
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:33,054
She said, "I thought I had
the angle on you there."

142
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:39,529
See that head slinging
to the outside?

143
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,402
That's unacceptable.

144
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:43,202
But she doesn't know
the difference.

145
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,140
She said,
"Well, up to this point,

146
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:48,236
I've had some pretty damn
good luck with that technique."

147
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:51,407
See there where she went
to run me over?

148
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:54,884
That means she's trying
to protect herself.

149
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:56,409
But when I get done,

150
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:59,719
I will not have to close my hand
on the end of this rope.

151
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:02,453
Now, I'd touch her here
on the neck.

152

Nobody's here to hurt you."

- One of the things
that really struck me

155
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:15,699
was that you always grow up
hearing about breaking horses

or breaking broncos
or something.

00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,814
almost like Parris Island
and a drill instructor,

161
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,483
and I think it first clicked
for me with Buck

162
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,754
at the whole concept
of starting.

163
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:40,389
- My early exposure to horses
was severe:

164
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:43,195
tying horses to posts
with an inner tube tire

165
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:44,633
so that when the horse
pulled back,

166
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:46,534
they would slam back
into the post.

167
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,936
It was really brutal,

168
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,064
really, truly brutal.

169
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,335
It was heartbreaking.

170
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,400
I didn't know any different.
I was a child.

171
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:54,638
But I remember crying a lot.

172
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:58,410
I felt very, very bad
for the animals.

173
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:02,078
So when I met Buck,
I was the instant convert.

174
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,378
- You can't be a good guy
when you leave the barn

175
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:07,357
and a bad guy
when you get to the barn.

176
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,554
And if I treat animals this way,
do I treat people that way too?

177
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,189
We all know the answer to that.

178
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,530
- I met Buck probably at
his first clinic that he gave.

179
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,332
If I wasn't at his first clinic,
I was probably at his second.

180
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:32,582
- There was a nice change.

181
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:42,690
- And the first time I saw
was amazing to me.

182
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:44,717
I-I-it just blew my mind.

183
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,559
It just blew my mind
that it could be done in a way

184
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,759
that the horse would cooperate,
like the people,

185
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:51,496
and not be scarred up
and afraid for life.

186
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:58,372
I couldn't believe
what that man could do

187
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:01,401
with a horse
without anything on it.

188
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,175
I mean, he could load horses
in a horse trailer

189
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:04,442
without touching them.

190
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,950
I mean, it-the horse
has never been in a trailer.

191
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:08,816
That's phenomenal.

192
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:23,793
Why let an animal live in fear?

193
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:26,235
Why not fix it?

194
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:29,171
- That's pretty good.

195
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:31,368
You notice how I don't have
to have a death grip

196
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,377
on the doggone lead rope now.

197
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:41,715
- In this particular discipline,
if you want to be great,

198
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:44,017
you have to be
a sensitive person.

199
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:45,351
That vulnerability,

200
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:48,848
that sensitivity to feel
the subtle change

201
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:50,417
is what makes you great.

202
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:52,759
That's why so many of the folks
that are really good at this

203
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:57,325
are-you know, sometimes they're
tortured souls, you know?

204
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,401
[horse neighs]

205
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:15,445
- I've seen some
kind of dark things in my life,

206
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:18,546
but everybody has a bit
of a burden to bear

207
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:19,920
of some sort,

208
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:21,618
so it's all relative.

209
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:27,056
It's all I ever wanted to be
was a cowboy.

210
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:29,191
I grew up as a trick roper.

211
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:35,366
That wasn't necessarily
by choice,

212
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:37,840
but the first thing is,
we were entertainers,

213
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,274
my brother and I.

214
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:42,370
I started doing rope tricks
when I was three years old.

215
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:44,210
You wouldn't think
that a three-year-old

216
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:48,685
could be doing rope tricks,
but I was doing rope tricks.

217
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,621
I turned professional
when I was six.

218
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,453
And as far as I know,

219
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:57,586
We are still the youngest kids
to ever get a PRCA card,

220
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,289
which it was the RCA
in those days,

221
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:01,889
Rodeo Cowboy Association.

222
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:05,232
And we went to fairs and rodeos
and performed all over.

223
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:07,533
But we really enjoyed
the attention of the crowds.

224
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,200
We were kind of
childhood celebrities, you know.

225
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:13,301
We were
the Kellogg's Sugar Pops kids.

226
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:16,211
- You know, fancy roping
takes hard work,

227
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:19,148
plenty of sleep,
and good nutrition every day.

228
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:21,242
Here's a good
hardworking breakfast.

229
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:24,948
- Oh, it must have been 1970,
'71, right around in there.

230
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:28,015
It was just before my mom
passed away.

231
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:29,720
That was quite a thing.

232
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,524
And all I remember
about that commercial,

233
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,858
it should have been real fun,

234
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,796
'cause it was a big thrill
to all the kids in school

235
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,390
that we were on
national television

236
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,129
doing these TV commercials.

237
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,932
All I really remember about that

238
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,963
is that my dad beat us
unmercifully

239
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:45,635
for not putting on
a perfect performance,

240
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:47,507
and then he drove us home,

241
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,843
and, heck, he couldn't even wait
till we got home.

242
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:52,713
He stopped and knocked on us
a little bit more.

243
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,848
I remember my mom
would drop us off at school.

244
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:00,653
The last couple of years
she was alive,

245
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:04,388
she was working as a waitress
in Ennis, Montana,

246
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,828
and I would beg her
not to leave,

247
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:08,229
and every day, I would cry;

248
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,928
every day, she would cry,

249
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,232
because I was just terrified
of the fact

250
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:18,038
that I was gonna be five
or six hours alone with our dad

251
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:21,101
when we got home from school
before my mom would get home,

252
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:25,377
'cause things always went better
when she was around.

253
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:27,782
But then when my mom died,

254
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:31,812
I knew my life was over
as I knew it,

255
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:34,848
and I no longer had
my protector.

256
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,257
Well, after my mom passed away,
my dad really fell apart,

257
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,426
and night after night
after night,

258
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:44,934
he would come yank us
out of the bed

259
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:46,630
in the middle of the night

260
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,697
and make us sit at this
kitchen table, this oak table.

261
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:53,039
I could draw the grain in
that table for you to this day,

262
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:54,908
'cause you'd just stare down
at the table,

263
00:13:54,934 --> 00:14:00,145
because even to just look
at my dad

264
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:04,382
when he was ranting and raving
in a drunken stupor,

265
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,619
he would take that
as an aggressive expression.

266
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:09,523
And one night, I just said,

267
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:12,154
"I'm not gonna get beat up
again tonight.

268
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,460
I'm just-I can't do it."

269
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:18,434
And I made a mad dash outside

270
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:21,597
and not thinking about the fact

271
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:24,836
that I wasn't very well-dressed
for being outside

272
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,071
in the middle of the winter,
'cause it was cold.

273
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:29,670
It was somewhere
between 10, 20 below zero.

274
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,340
Well, damn,
then I was really stuck,

275
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,906
because I knew
if I went back inside,

276
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:34,508
he was gonna beat me
half to death,

277
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,042
and I just couldn't go back in.

278
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:39,022
I just couldn't.

279
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,320
We had a dog,
and his name was Duke,

280
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:43,384
and I loved that dog.

281
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:45,326
It sounds real trailer park,
I know,

282
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,729
but he lived
in a 55-gallon barrel

283
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:50,393
with straw in it for his bed,

284
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:53,062
and I crawled
in that 55-gallon barrel

285
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,230
with that bloodhound.

286
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,604
It wasn't warm,
but it kept me from freezing,

287
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:59,371
and I finally,
after two or three hours,

288
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,036
went back in the house,

289
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:04,707
and he just looked at me like,
"Where you been?"

290
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,538
Reata, I can't believe
you answered your phone.

291
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:31,597
Where are you?

292
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,631
- [speaking indistinctly]

293
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,076
- Oh, cool.
What are you doing?

294
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,510
- [speaking indistinctly]

295
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:37,343
- For your mom or for school?

296
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:38,439
- For school.

297
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,778
- All right, well,
I'll call her back,

298
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:41,478
and then I'll talk to you
tomorrow, huh?

299
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:42,611
- Okay, sounds good.

300
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:43,984
- Okay, love you, buddy.

301
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,010
Bye.

302
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,857
I was watching Oprah.

303
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,363
I don't know if I should
admit to that.

304
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:54,557
But I was watching Oprah,

305
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:57,590
and she said that
the greatest aphrodisiac

306
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,900
there was for a man
was to have a vacuum

307
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:04,601
and to actually run it
in the presence of his wife.

308
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,975
So she knows quite a bit,

309
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,914
so I thought, "Well, I'll-
it can't hurt."

310
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:13,109
You know, you never know

311
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:16,017
where you're gonna get
some information.

312
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:21,380
Hey, you.

313
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:27,054
Gonna put the smaller one
in the back.

314
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:29,965
There's not quite as much room.

315
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:34,861
We got 27 years in now.

316
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:37,169
Yeah, 27 years.

317
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:40,177
I get to where I don't even
worry about what day it is.

318
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:44,147
All I know is, it's just all
in four-day intervals for me.

319
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:48,549
I don't know; you get
in a rhythm by doing this,

320
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:52,283
and you-oh, after just
a few days of being somewhere,

321
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:55,224
you're kind of ready to go
to the next one.

322
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:59,286
Hey, Mary, it's just me.

323
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:02,731
Good.
What are you doing?

324
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:07,727
Got the clinic done here.
Didn't make anybody cry.

325
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,898
[chuckles]

326
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:10,429
Talk to you later on.

327
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:12,373
All right, Mary,
I miss you.

328
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:16,073
I do this 40 weeks
out of the year.

329
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:17,637
For the rest of the year,
you could say,

330
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:19,444
"Where are you gonna be
on such and such a day?"

331
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:21,212
and I could tell you
exactly where I'm gonna be

332
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,913
till about Thanksgiving.

333
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:25,148
Walkertown, North Carolina.

334
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:27,555
Huntsville, Alabama.

335
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,217
Limerick, Maine.

336
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:31,091
Bay Harbor, Michigan.

337
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:32,993
Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

338
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:34,588
Longmont, Colorado.

339
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,395
Thermopolis, Wyoming.

340
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:38,231
Bend, Oregon.

341
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:40,134
Bozeman, Montana.

342
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,105
Libby, Montana.

343
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,606
Yeah, there's some loneliness.

344
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:49,044
You know, it's truck stops
and driving late at night

345
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,105
and just trying to get
to your next spot,

346
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:52,342
and you're alone, you know?

347
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:53,975
That's when you really
miss your family,

348
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:56,384
and you want to be home,

349
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,944
and you think
of what it would be like

350
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:00,115
just walking barefoot
across the living room

351
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:01,920
and going to bed.

352
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:04,359
But there is no way
that's ever gonna be anything

353
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,989
other than what it is.

354
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:13,800
How are you?
- Hey, how are you?

355
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:17,603
[indistinct chatter]

356
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:20,132
- She's gonna make me
a Manhattan.

357
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:23,772
- And I can make more than one
if somebody wants one.

358
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,076
They're in the back.

359
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,414
- Were you at that clinic
in Ellensburg

360
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,680
When it was so cold,
when Bob Blackwell-

361
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,085
- Yeah, that was 17 years ago.

362
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,283
- That was my first clinic
with you.

363
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:34,814
- And they brought them in,

364
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:37,953
these horses in,
in stock trailers, literally.

365
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,018
They opened up the door,

366
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:40,359
and they went
into the round pen,

367
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:44,299
and there was
15 or 17 Colts,

368
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:46,633
and he roped every one of them.

369
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:52,138
A mutual friend invited me,

370
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,474
and I was pretty skeptical
about the clinic

371
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,638
and the approach.

372
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,146
And I went pretty convinced

373
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:01,379
that I wasn't gonna
appreciate anything that I saw.

374
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:05,513
And then he started working
with all these babies...

375
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:12,757
And I was blown away.

376
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:14,661
I mean, I couldn't believe
what I saw

377
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:17,667
and the rapport
that he had with them.

378
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:27,537
You know, it just kind of
stopped me in my tracks.

379
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,816
My whole life has been
encompassed around Arabian

380
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,408
and half-Arabian show horses

381
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,043
from the time
I was a little girl.

382
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:37,985
I was showing horses

383
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,887
and thinking that everything
was cool,

384
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,016
the way I was doing things

385
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:43,322
and the way I saw things
being done,

386
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:47,091
and I'm proud of a lot
of those prizes that I won,

387
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,793
but I'm equally ashamed
of a lot of them too.

388
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:52,563
Horses are put
into forced positions

389
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:55,902
that they're neither mentally or
physically prepared to handle,

390
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:58,909
and these practices aren't used
nearly as much now

391
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:01,241
as they were years ago,

392
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,746
but the horses would be
put into hook hobbles

393
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:06,773
that would go from the hooks
up through the snaffle

394
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:08,079
and back down

395
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:09,915
so that every time
he took a step with his hooks,

396
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:12,616
you know, it'd take
ahold of his face

397
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:16,922
to teach him to stay
into that real infixed position.

398
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,054
But there's no connection
for the horse.

399
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:22,554
There's no understanding of that
except for it hurts.

400
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:25,899
So they're gonna stay away
from those pressures

401
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:29,235
and learn to infix themselves
into those positions

402
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:31,571
because-through intimidation.

403
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:34,441
And I just thought that that's
the way you did it.

404
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:37,379
And that's what the horses
had to do to be show horses,

405
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,713
and you don't realize
how unjust it is until you-

406
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,776
until someone shows you
a different path.

407
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:46,685
- Come on.

408
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:52,890
Let's say the horse
needed you to be firm.

409
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,421
There's a difference
between firm and hard.

410
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:57,559
Let's say I needed
to take ahold of the horse

411
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:58,761
with 20 pounds.

412
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:03,705
The way I go about
getting to 20 pounds

413
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:05,174
is gonna have a lot to do
with whether

414
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:07,404
you're successful or not.

415
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:08,536
Hold on to that.

416
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:09,705
I'm gonna pull on you some,

417
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:11,681
so don't let me
get it away from you.

418
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:13,114
Okay, so close your hand
on that,

419
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:14,811
or it's gonna come away
from you,

420
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,410
and don't give to me.

421
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:21,550
Let's say I needed to pull
on this horse about that hard.

422
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:25,551
The way I took ahold of you
wasn't really offensive,

423
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:27,222
wouldn't make you afraid.

424
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:30,131
But let's say I was abrupt
and had hands like a butcher

425
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:33,295
and I took ahold of the horse
like that.

426
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:35,931
Now, I'm pulling
about like what I said,

427
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,872
but it's how I got there.

428
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:39,239
Be ready.

429
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:43,440
It's how I got there
that could be rude to the horse.

430
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:46,540
Now, watch Robert closely.

431
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:48,710
I'm just riding with bad hands.

432
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,584
Oh, you braced.

433
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,682
I didn't hit you.
Why'd you do that?

434
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:57,557
He's protecting himself.

435
00:21:57,582 --> 00:21:59,858
Once I've done this
a few times with him,

436
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:01,796
he'll brace all the time
like that.

437
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,424
See him brace?
You can't help yourself.

438
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:05,230
And I'm even telling you
you're gonna do it,

439
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:07,032
and you still can't help it.

440
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,437
But if I took ahold like this,
you might give to me,

441
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:10,940
and then I'd give to you.

442
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:14,000
But it's the way I go about it,
and whenever you're ready,

443
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:16,638
maybe you'd give to me, see.

444
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,341
Otherwise I'll just wait here.

445
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,044
Nobody's gonna get
any lunch today.

446
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:24,486
When you started to soften,
so did I,

447
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,318
and you both feel together.

448
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:29,292
If you were real sensitive to me
when I feel of you here,

449
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:31,726
you'd already be giving, see?

450
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,696
That means something
to my horse.

451
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:35,062
That's what a soft feel-

452
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:37,294
that's what I do to get
a soft feel right there.

453
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,092
And I want you to get
at least a mental picture

454
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,503
of what a horse
operating on a feel is

455
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:45,838
to where hopefully
it looks good to you,

456
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:50,244
that you'll want that,
that you'll strive for that.

457
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:54,114
So this is one example
of a feel, see.

458
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:57,882
I could even take on this rope
right here like this, see.

459
00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:00,287
That's operating on a feel, see.

460
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:02,553
I could do this
and say, "Get back."

461
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:04,561
And I could do this
and say, "Get over."

462
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:09,032
Without touching him,
your energy moves the horse.

463
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,762
Most people think of a feel
as when you touch something

464
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,861
or someone and what it
feels like to your fingers,

465
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:18,398
but a feel can have a thousand
different definitions.

466
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:22,408
Sometimes feel
is a mental thing.

467
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:25,347
Sometimes feel can happen
clear across the arena.

468
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,940
That's what
I'm looking for there.

469
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:31,421
Sort of an invitation
from the horse to come to you.

470
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:37,623
It's not always physical.
Sometimes it's mental.

471
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:39,356
When you have the physical
working for you

472
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:40,829
when you're younger,

473
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:44,459
you ride with 90% physical
and 10% mental.

474
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,699
But if you could learn
how to use 90% mental

475
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:53,539
and 10% physical,
you'd be better off.

476
00:23:55,300 --> 00:24:00,272
I'm looking for the horse
to learn how to follow a feel.

477
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:02,478
It's supposed to take
that much.

478
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,754
Little bit more.
There.

479
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:13,058
Left, right,
left, right,

480
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:16,327
left, right.

481
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:17,662
Everything is a dance.

482
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:21,227
Everything you do with a horse
is a dance.

483
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:23,933
Now I'll open him up
a little bit here.

484
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:28,010
Problem is, when a lot
of folks can't get a horse

485
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:29,603
to operate on a feel,

486
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,045
they'll get
a little more bridle,

487
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:33,049
get a little more shank on it,

488
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:35,051
drive a spur through
the horse's shoulder,

489
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:36,643
then tie his head down,

490
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:38,985
then get a bicycle chain
over his nose.

491
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,353
I mean, it doesn't stop.

492
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:42,756
It becomes medieval.

493
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:44,954
Now, I'm gonna tip the life
up in him here.

494
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,894
We're moving on a feel.

495
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:48,795
You know, a horse
is pretty sensitive.

496
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:52,290
A horse can feel a mosquito land
on their butt in a windstorm

497
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,429
Every movement you make
on a horse,

498
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:57,565
there is a perfect position
of balance

499
00:24:57,596 --> 00:25:00,509
that takes no energy
from the horse.

500
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:04,002
He doesn't feel like
he is pushing you along with him

501
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:06,413
or dragging you along with him.

502
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:23,495
- He's built to fit a horse,
you know?

503
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:27,436
God had him in mind
when he made a cowboy, you know?

504
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:31,669
I've never actually seen him
whisper a horse,

505
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:34,802
but I guess if there's
a horse whisperer out there,

506
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,107
it's Buck Brannaman

507
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:38,614
I don't know, you know?

508
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:46,821
- Originally, I got connected
to The Horse Whisperer

509
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:48,756
through Nick Evans,
and he said,

510
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:52,523
"I'm researching some characters
for my book,

511
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:56,192
and I'm trying to find a way to
bring this character to life."

512
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,292
And I was doing a clinic
in California,

513
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:01,861
and kind of a hippie-looking guy
came up, and he said,

514
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:03,634
"I'm a movie producer."

515
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:07,303
He said, "l was wondering if you
could meet with me and Bob."

516
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:09,972
I Said, "Bob'?"

517
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:14,916
- In my business, artificiality
is part of the business.

518
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,749
You look for authentic people.

519
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:19,346
And so when I met Buck,

520
00:26:19,377 --> 00:26:21,983
my first thought was,
"Well, what the hell is this?"

521
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:23,822
Guy walks into an office
in Santa Monica.

522
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:25,088
He's got a big hat on.

523
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:27,062
He's got his vest
and so forth.

524
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,621
He looks like he's got
a costume on,

525
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:30,496
and I thought "Oh, my God,
you know, what's..."

526
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:32,968
And his compatriot
who was with him,

527
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:34,197
the same outfit,
and I thought,

528
00:26:34,225 --> 00:26:37,263
"Oh, jeez,
what have I gotten into here?"

529
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:43,371
And then the etiquette,
the politeness,

530
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:47,474
the humanity that kind of
came off real quick

531
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:49,314
kind of erased that,

532
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:51,480
and then we sat in the office
for about an hour and a half

533
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:54,718
and talked about things
that were authentic,

534
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:57,522
and so l realized
that l was really dealing

535
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:59,153
with what I would call
"the real deal."

536
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:02,631
No-nonsense guy,
no-nonsense, you know,

537
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:05,658
Whether with the animal
or people.

538
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:08,569
He was an adviser
that I brought on

539
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:13,133
that slowly worked his way
into the core of the filmmaking

540
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:15,405
because he just knew more.

541
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:17,276
So Buck contributed everything
as a model

542
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,508
and also as a player.

543
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:19,913
I used him as a double.

544
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:23,647
So he was a huge part
of the fabric of the film,

545
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:24,745
and he was able to do things

546
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:27,154
that the hired trainer
could not do.

547
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:32,890
- There was a scene
that Scarlett was supposed

548
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:34,988
to go into the stall
with the horse,

549
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,058
and it was her first time
being nearthe horse

550
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:40,501
since the accident,

551
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:42,505
and the action
for the horse was,

552
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:45,098
he was supposed to sort of
paw the ground

553
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,736
and show a little aggression

554
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:50,144
and then come to her
and respond to her

555
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:54,981
and more or less
put his head in her arms,

556
00:27:55,006 --> 00:28:00,183
and it was an, "Aw, gee,"
a real touching scene,

557
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:01,713
and they couldn't get the shot

558
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:03,657
because the horse
was a trick horse,

559
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:08,859
and they are trained to not take
their eyes off the trainer.

560
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:12,494
- The horse nuzzled the wood.
The horse nuzzled the frame.

561
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,663
The horse nuzzled
the boots of the trainer

562
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,434
but wouldn't nuzzle Scarlett.

563
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:17,769
The meter was ticking,

564
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:19,901
and, you know, time is money
and all that stuff.

565
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:21,638
So I was going into a panic.

566
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:24,272
- They said,
"What are we gonna do?"

567
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:26,441
I said, "What do you mean,
what are you gonna do?"

568
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:29,145
He said,
"Well, we never got that shot."

569
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:31,745
I said, "Yeah, we sure spent
along time at it too."

570
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:34,780
He said, "Yeah, eight hours.
You got any ideas?"

571
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:37,919
I said, "Yeah, why don't we use
my horse, Pet?"

572
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:39,860
And at first,
everybody said,

573
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:42,956
"Well, you know,
you don't understand, Buck.

574
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:45,194
"You know, we use
Hollywood trick horses for this

575
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,463
"because they' re performers,

576
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:47,868
"and they can do things
on the mark

577
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,099
"so we can pull a focus
on a certain place,

578
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:51,869
"and you just don't
understand that.

579
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:54,376
"We don't-not downplaying
your thing, Buck,

580
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,106
"but it's like-but Pet,

581
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:57,841
"he doesn't know how to work
on a mark.

582
00:28:57,869 --> 00:28:59,507
He's not an actor."

583
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:02,279
I said, "No, he's a horse."

584
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:04,651
I said, "What do you have
to lose?"

585
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:06,314
So I dinked around
with my horse

586
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:07,652
and got him
where I could lead him

587
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,420
by front foot
with a rope on him,

588
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:11,222
and I got him
where I could jiggle that rope,

589
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:15,254
and he'd paw the ground
on the mark.

590
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,806
So he came up,
and he just put his head

591
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:25,034
right in her chest,

592
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:27,270
and she wrapped her arms
around that horse,

593
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:33,180
laid her head on his forehead,
and everybody was crying.

594
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,446
- God, within 15-20
minutes, it was close.

595
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:41,946
So Buck played a greater role
than a lot of people realize.

596
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,154
He contributed everything.

597
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:47,957
There was a humanity

598
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:50,057
and a kind of gentleness
of spirit

599
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:53,763
that I adopted for
that character because of Buck.

600
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:58,007
- When I saw
the finished product,

601
00:29:58,029 --> 00:29:59,736
he looked good.

602
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:02,005
I told him, "There is some
potential there, Bob,

603
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:04,912
"if this movie thing
doesn't work out for you.

604
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:06,438
"l think I could probably
get you

605
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,473
to where you could make
a living doing this."

606
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:09,541
[laughs]

607
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:12,612
- This one you want me
to take right here?

608
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,351
- Yeah.

609
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:15,915
Okay, Reata.

610
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:20,393
I might have you check on Charro
and see if he's eaten.

611
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:21,522
- Okay.

612
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:24,329
I've been traveling with Dad
during the summers,

613
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:27,302
usually from end of June
till end of August.

614
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:32,104
It's been two months
since I've seen my dad.

615
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,576
My dad's on the road
nine months out of the year,

616
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:37,375
and it's tough,
but I'm kind of used to it now.

617
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:39,848
I mean, I've been doing it
since I was-well, forever, so...

618
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:42,715
Heads up.

619
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:46,244
- We've got a few sacks of feed
to schlep across here.

620
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:51,690
Reata, you and Nevada need
to go wrap up all the sound.

621
00:30:51,716 --> 00:30:53,696
- Yeah, Nevada's going with me.

622
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:55,493
My partner in crime.

623
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,090
- I just started traveling
with them last year.

624
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:58,327
I spent a month with them.

625
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,858
I think we're helpful
to a point.

626
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:01,336
Sometimes maybe
we're in the way,

627
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,361
'cause he has, like,
a way of doing things, you know?

628
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:04,464
- What are you doing?

629
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:05,701
- Bringing you breakfast.

630
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,676
- What is it?
- Sticky buns.

631
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,042
- I might just have one.

632
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:10,944
I don't want the-

633
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:12,107
That'll do me.

634
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:13,206
Thanks, mate.

635
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:15,479
So I guess you got
a lot of songs transferred

636
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:17,042
for me on my iPod.

637
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:19,555
- Traveling with Dad, it can get
pretty stressful sometimes

638
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:22,683
just because he is, like,
a travel Nazi.

639
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:26,595
- Make sure you plug
that little deal-give me that.

640
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:28,620
- 'Cause he has his own way
of how he does everything,

641
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:31,065
and we kind of mess up
the process sometimes.

642
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:32,227
- Aw, Reata.

643
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:34,203
Aw, you put the top
on backwards.

644
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,762
- But then when it comes
to, like, cleaning pens

645
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:38,671
and saddling his horses
and stuff like that,

646
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:40,505
I think he kind of
appreciates us.

647
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:41,532
- How'd you do?

648
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,011
- Nasty.

649
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:44,069
- Hey, Reata.
- Yeah.

650
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:46,241
- Bring me back
a sack for trash when you-

651
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:47,249
after you feed.

652
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:48,250
- Sure.

653
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:49,251
I ride every summer.

654
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:50,617
I usually take one of my horses.

655
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:54,249
- Step up in here and get
a dally on and stop my horse.

656
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:56,418
- I get a lot-
I learn a lot on it.

657
00:31:56,447 --> 00:32:00,395
- Every clinic that we go to
during the summer is different.

658
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:03,365
The horses are different,
different people.

659
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:05,561
- There, you followed by feel.

660
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,230
The horse world can be
pretty cliquey.

661
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:11,365
Well, we don't go for cliques
around here.

662
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,775
There are probably
some people here

663
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:15,334
that it's just pittance,

664
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:17,277
pocket change for them to come,

665
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:20,306
and some of them save
all year long

666
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:21,874
just to be able to go
to this clinic.

667
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:25,319
Put on my Madonna microphone.

668
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:26,981
How we fixed here, Maggie?

669
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:29,218
You getting his chin down
a little bit?

670
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:30,920
You want to release
as quick as you can.

671
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,519
He's gonna give in a second.

672
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,654
There, there.

673
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:35,858
Pet him.
That's the way.

674
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:38,333
My daughter,
she had a hard time releasing.

675
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:41,929
I'd say, "Reata, your arms,"
and she'd go like that.

676
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:46,102
Spread your hands a little more.
Get them a little lower.

677
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,132
There you go.

678
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:49,144
Nice.

679
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:51,807
You want that horse
to be an extension of you,

680
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:53,645
but then you don't control
your legs.

681
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:55,844
You think you're just gonna
control this part of the body.

682
00:32:55,873 --> 00:32:58,479
This is a body.
The whole thing is a body.

683
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:00,113
If all of you didn't have
a horse here

684
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:01,589
and I was trying to talk to you,

685
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:03,114
wouldn't that be weird
if you said,

686
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,956
"Hey, I don't have control
of my legs."

687
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,394
All of a sudden,
they just tear off,

688
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:08,795
and you're like,
"Oh, jeez, sorry."

689
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:13,033
Waiting on the coffee.

690
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:14,536
- He's got to have his coffee.

691
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,836
- Black, I'm sure that comes
as a big surprise.

692
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:20,365
- He has the coffee,
and then he lets down,

693
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:22,571
and it kind of smooths out.

694
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,440
- Going to Sheridan,
Montana.

695
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:29,577
- Sheridan, Montana, is there,
and we're up here,

696
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:32,019
probably seven hours.

697
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:33,579
Not too long.

698
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:42,457
- Yeah, it's a great
bunch of folks at this clinic.

699
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:44,125
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

700
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:45,759
- Welcome to Montana.

701
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:48,134
- A lot of them,
I've known since I was a kid.

702
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,036
Some of them,
I went to school with.

703
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:53,042
Some of them, I went to school
with their parents.

704
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:55,203
It's like-it's coming home
for me here.

705
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:56,541
- it's gonna be a busy week,

706
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:58,274
'cause Mom's gonna be
in Sheridan.

707
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:02,751
- Hi.

708
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:03,775
- How are you?

709
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:05,481
- I'm good.

710
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,750
- How are you?

711
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:08,451
-I haven't seen Mary
for a couple of months.

712
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:10,481
- Hi, Dally.
Hi, buddy.

713
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:12,961
So it's been an awful long run.

714
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:15,521
Mary, she doesn't like
to travel as much,

715
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,863
but I'd sure like her to go
with me a little bit more,

716
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,869
and she may go with me
a little bit more

717
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,802
once Reata goes off to college.

718
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:24,033
- So this is Twyla, Rudy.
This is Dally.

719
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,700
- Oh, Dally.
- Hey, Rudy.

720
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:29,303
Rudy's grown a little bit
since I left.

721
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:31,210
I don't know how many dogs
you need

722
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:34,580
before you have enough dogs.

723
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:39,213
They worked their way up
the food chain past me,

724
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,814
but my wife loves them,
and I love my wife,

725
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:45,157
so if it makes her happy...

726
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:47,390
makes me happy.

727
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:50,228
- I actually do like traveling
on the road.

728
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,631
It's fun.
it's really fun.

729
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:54,102
I mean, you get to meet
a lot of different people

730
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:56,833
and see a lot of different
beautiful places.

731
00:34:56,861 --> 00:35:00,308
Like, this place is amazing.

732
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:02,572
But I like staying home too,
though.

733
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,670
- Okay, are there any of you

734
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:05,271
that have any real problems
with them

735
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:06,941
that you'd like
to kind of mention?

736
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:08,211
- He runs me over.

737
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:10,651
- He runs you over?

738
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:12,018
Okay, lovely.

739
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:15,320
Well, a baby like that,
they're not trying to be pushy.

740
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:17,587
They might be sort of
crowding you just a little bit

741
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,356
because they still might
be scared.

742
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:21,624
They kind of think that maybe
if they get real close to you,

743
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:24,326
they'll get some comfort.

744
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:26,665
And the big thing, you guys, is,

745
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:29,604
don't be overly critical
of them,

746
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,334
'cause they're just babies.

747
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:34,468
If he feels like you're angry
at him at all,

748
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:36,501
he will shut down.

749
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:43,816
- I don't know where Buck draws
his real personal strength from,

750
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:46,082
because he's lived
through a lot.

751
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,589
I mean, it-

752
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:49,888
He came out of such dire straits

753
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:53,123
and, you know, was virtually,
I think, plucked from his home

754
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,495
in the middle of the night
sort of a thing.

755
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,868
- it's areal hard story
to tell, 'cause, you know,

756
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:03,395
you see him now,

757
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:05,703
and, you know,
I don't even think about that.

758
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:10,878
Ace was real hard on those boys.

759
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:12,813
You knew there was
something wrong there maybe,

760
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,010
but you weren't for sure what.

761
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:17,041
You know, he kept it hid
pretty well, I guess,

762
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:22,080
until the point
when Coach Cleverly...

763
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,927
You know, seen his back.

764
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,668
Ah, that's a hard story
to think about.

765
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:44,908
Bob Cleverly was a typical
football coach that you loved

766
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:47,177
but feared too, you know,

767
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:51,381
and he'd actually made Buck
shower in PE,

768
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:54,856
and when he didn't want
to shower, you know,

769
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:57,018
and he told him to,
you know, get undressed

770
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,686
and get in the shower,

771
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,992
you know, as soon as Buck
started taking his shirt off,

772
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:04,864
he seen the whip marks,

773
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,870
and the thing of it is,

774
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,735
is, you know,
he just basically told him,

775
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,003
he said, "Your dad
will never beat you again.

776
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:15,237
I'll make sure of that,"
you know.

777
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:18,975
And then that's
when Johnny France

778
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:22,177
kind of started the ball rolling
to get Buck and Smokie

779
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:24,686
to a safe place.

780
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:30,785
- I was present when the boys
were forced to disrobe,

781
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:34,422
and on their legs
and their little buttocks

782
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:38,628
were these big whip marks

783
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:42,627
where their dad had beat them.

784
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:46,767
When I looked at these
little boys, I said,

785
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:50,836
"No, we'll have
none of that."

786
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:55,078
I took them to the Shirleys.

787
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:59,145
- They were two frightened
little boys,

788
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:03,818
but it wasn't too long
before the two boys were just-

789
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:07,159
they just turned
into Shirleys.

790
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:09,221
- My mom had-

791
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:10,698
had just died.

792
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:13,065
- And she was very loving,
wasn't she?

793
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:16,628
- Yeah.
- She was a very loving lady.

794
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:19,972
- So she became my new mom,

795
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:23,843
and, boy, that was something
I really needed.

796
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:25,879
Sleep good?

797
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:27,143
- I did.

798
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:28,707
- They have
a wonderful relationship,

799
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:31,515
and she's a guiding force.

800
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:33,681
- May God bless you
and watch over you.

801
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:35,315
- There's no sense that,

802
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:36,723
"Okay, you're raised.
You're gone."

803
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:37,919
I mean, she's their mother.

804
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:39,621
She's truly their mother,

805
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:43,530
and I think Betsy raised
something like 23 foster sons.

806
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:46,000
I mean, all boys, all boys.

807
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:49,596
- When our kids were little,

808
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:50,935
it was like a zoo,

809
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:53,840
and it was every man
for himself

810
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:58,176
and survival of the fittest

811
00:38:58,202 --> 00:39:02,207
My motto that's stood me
in good stead is,

812
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:04,014
"Blessed are the flexible,

813
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:07,420
for they shall not get
bent out of shape."

814
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:10,551
- [laughs]

815
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:19,966
My foster dad taught me
how to shoe horses.

816
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,992
I was 12 years old.

817
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:26,270
When I first went to live
with them,

818
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:30,575
he told me, "Kid, you might not
ever amount to much,

819
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:34,139
"but you better learn how
to ride a colt and shoe a horse.

820
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:35,844
"And then you'll always
be able to eat.

821
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:38,319
"Even if you can't
get much of a job,

822
00:39:38,342 --> 00:39:40,549
you'll always be able to eat."

823
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:44,651
So he taught me how to shoe
a horse over a period of time.

824
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:49,261
There were so many things
that I learned

825
00:39:49,286 --> 00:39:53,701
while I was with
my foster parents.

826
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:57,001
When I first got dropped off
at the Shirley ranch,

827
00:39:57,027 --> 00:40:01,601
I was so terrified of men,
and my foster-dad-to-be,

828
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:05,774
he pulled in in the truck,
and, gee, he was tall, 6'-4",

829
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:08,875
just looked like he was made
out of rawhide and barbwire.

830
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,442
But he walked right up to me,
and he said,

831
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:11,885
"You must be Buck,"

832
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:15,823
and I shook his hand,
but I couldn't even speak.

833
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:19,191
It's real; you can be so scared
that you can't say anything.

834
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:20,217
No words come out.

835
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,889
I just sat there,

836
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:25,162
and my little knees were
just about knocking together.

837
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:28,033
I was a little guy.

838
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:30,766
And then he spun around,
walked back to the truck,

839
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:32,638
and opened the door,

840
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:35,109
and my heart just stopped.

841
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:40,775
Because it's almost like a colt
that's had some trouble.

842
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:45,220
You don't have to do too much
to make them suspicious,

843
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:48,018
just even move
in a little bit of a way

844
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:50,423
that they don't understand
or can't comprehend,

845
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:54,487
and that quick, they-

846
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:57,328
they think they heed
to save themselves.

847
00:40:57,354 --> 00:41:01,734
So when he went back to
that truck and opened the door,

848
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:03,830
I didn't know what to do.

849
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:06,774
Scared me to death.

850
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:11,644
He came back, and he threw me
a pair of buckskin gloves.

851
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:13,012
He said, "Here."

852
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:17,110
He said,
"You're gonna need them,"

853
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:20,418
and, gee,
they were just beautiful,

854
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:23,015
and they fit me perfect.

855
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:25,254
I was so proud of them.

856
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:30,823
And he looked over
at the ranch truck,

857
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:33,768
and he said, "Get in."

858
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:35,031
So we got in,

859
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:38,597
and he always had fencing tools
in the truck.

860
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:39,767
So we took off,

861
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:42,334
and we built fence
all afternoon,

862
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:45,711
pounding steel posts into rocks
and pulling wire,

863
00:41:45,736 --> 00:41:48,546
but I wouldn't wear
those gloves.

864
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:54,113
There was just that -
that token act of kindness,

865
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:55,919
just giving me
something like that.

866
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:57,220
Oh, gee, it meant so much.

867
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:59,558
I didn't want to get them
all tore up,

868
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:01,221
so I kept them in my pocket,

869
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:04,165
and I just worked with
the barbwire with my bare hands.

870
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:07,192
And he realized
that I didn't need someone

871
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:09,761
to just pity me
for what I'd been through.

872
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:11,704
He knew I just needed
something to do.

873
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:14,232
I needed a job to do.

874
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:16,336
And that's when things
started to head

875
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,779
in the right direction for me.

876
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:21,009
So I learned that
about the horses years later.

877
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:24,508
I thought, "Oh, yeah.

878
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:29,218
"That's kind of what Forrest did
with me, come to think of it."

879
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:31,248
[horse neighs]

880
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:38,323
You see the expression
on that horse?

881
00:42:38,355 --> 00:42:40,995
It moves, but he's Crabby.

882
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:43,266
Flagging the tail,
it's annoyed.

883
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:47,071
It's like asking your kid
to go take the garbage out.

884
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:48,474
They take the garbage out,

885
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:51,378
but they flip you the bird
on the way out of the room.

886
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:55,748
It's without respect,
and respect isn't fear.

887
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:56,843
It's acceptance.

888
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:59,286
- He bucks
whenever I saddle him-

889
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:01,017
not when I saddle him
but when I get him

890
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:02,581
to go through transitions.

891
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:05,594
I've never started a colt
ever in my life.

892
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:07,653
I've always been around
really well-broke ones.

893
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:11,462
So this is my first shot at it.

894
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:13,729
And he's got a little bit
of Buck in him.

895
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:14,827
So you must be Bill.

896
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:16,098
- I am Bill.

897
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:18,470
- That's why I asked Bill Seaton
to ride him,

898
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:22,671
'cause Chief needs a confident
rider for that first ride.

899
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,646
I bought Chief
about a year and a half ago.

900
00:43:24,668 --> 00:43:25,908
He was one.

901
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:28,177
He had never had
any human contact.

902
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:29,741
Born out in the field,

903
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:32,413
wasn't touched, handled,
nothing.

904
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:37,324
It's just a rodeo and disaster
waiting to happen.

905
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:40,090
- it's not his fault.

906
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:43,155
He's like a kid that just didn't
have any good parenting.

907
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:45,098
He just doesn't know
what's to be expected of him.

908
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,601
I want to check your horse out.

909
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,126
If you're gonna do
anything shocking,

910
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:50,069
I'd rather you did
the shocking stuff right here

911
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:51,801
than when you're on their back.

912
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:55,343
Right here.

913
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:56,743
Step over.

914
00:43:56,767 --> 00:44:00,806
He says, "Well, I prefer
you beg me."

915
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:01,839
Not a chance.

916
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,184
There's the good deal offered.

917
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:07,849
There's not so good a deal.

918
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:09,516
That's the thing with a horse.

919
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:12,425
You can't just love on them
and buy lots of carrots.

920
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:14,360
Bribery doesn't work
with horses.

921
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:17,025
No different than trying
to bribe a kid.

922
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:21,434
All it does is make
a contemptuous, spoiled horse.

923
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:25,497
But you don't want them
afraid of you.

924
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:28,442
You can be strict,
but you don't need to be unfair,

925
00:44:28,465 --> 00:44:30,069
and like I say,
it's not personal.

926
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,545
I don't feel any different
about him

927
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:34,412
than I do my own horse
I just stepped off.

928
00:44:34,438 --> 00:44:36,645
We're not mad at you.

929
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,881
One of the biggest challenges
of a horseman is,

930
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:41,355
is to be able to control
your emotions,

931
00:44:41,378 --> 00:44:44,188
because a person
might be quick to get all mad.

932
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:45,989
There you go.

933
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,086
That's better.

934
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:48,357
Let's go this way.

935
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:49,523
I said that way.

936
00:44:49,553 --> 00:44:52,432
You allow a horse
to make mistakes.

937
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:53,935
The horse will learn
from mistakes

938
00:44:53,957 --> 00:44:56,198
no different than the human.

939
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:58,604
But you can't get him to where
he dreads making mistakes

940
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:01,667
for fear of what's
gonna happen after he does.

941
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:04,179
Sometimes I'll just
move this flag around,

942
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:06,681
and I don't want him
to be afraid of it.

943
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:10,447
I'm saying just live with that.

944
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:13,478
Now we'll start again.

945
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:18,458
There's a change.

946
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:21,687
Attaboy.

947
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:30,069
- Buck says when you start
handling horses,

948
00:45:30,094 --> 00:45:33,303
your own personal issues
start coming out.

949
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:35,901
And I was so anxious
to see the saddle on Chief,

950
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:38,914
I rushed him to it,
and now I've built-

951
00:45:38,936 --> 00:45:40,415
I feel like I've built
this fear

952
00:45:40,437 --> 00:45:42,781
and this insecurity in him.

953
00:45:42,806 --> 00:45:44,911
But see,
I'm an insecure person,

954
00:45:44,942 --> 00:45:47,479
so they-
horses, they mirror you.

955
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:49,184
They can't lie.

956
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:51,250
- There.
Good boy.

957
00:45:51,281 --> 00:45:53,124
- Horsemanship,
fine horsemanship,

958
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:54,720
becomes a way of life.

959
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,527
It's not about controlling
the horses.

960
00:45:56,553 --> 00:46:01,798
It becomes
how you treat your spouse,

961
00:46:01,825 --> 00:46:04,601
how you treat strangers.

962
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:06,539
Will you give people a chance,

963
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:08,736
just like you give
the horses a chance?

964
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:11,178
It becomes how you discipline
your children.

965
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:13,477
You know, you can discipline
and discourage,

966
00:46:13,504 --> 00:46:15,313
or you can discipline
and encourage.

967
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:17,842
You can say,
"l see you tried that.

968
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:19,684
What do you think
you should try instead?"

969
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:22,486
- Tentative, but he tried,

970
00:46:22,513 --> 00:46:24,356
and I'd pet him with this.

971
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:26,759
You can just leave him be
for a little while.

972
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,923
Just kind of hang with him
and let that soak in.

973
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:31,933
- That's a more building
sort of approach

974
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:34,060
than, "That's wrong.
That's wrong. That's wrong."

975
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:35,502
- All right, it's time.

976
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:38,200
Go on out that end.
Go into the round Corral.

977
00:46:38,228 --> 00:46:40,504
We're gonna go
for a little ride here.

978
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:46,077
How you getting along, Bill?
- Great.

979
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:48,276
- Looks pretty good.

980
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:49,579
Sure does, doesn't it?

981
00:46:49,606 --> 00:46:53,418
See if you can get on a lope.

982
00:46:53,443 --> 00:46:55,286
Good.
Well done.

983
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:57,292
- Coming through.
- There you go.

984
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:58,554
Way to go.

985
00:46:58,582 --> 00:47:00,391
That should have felt
pretty good to you, Bill.

986
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:01,919
- It did.

987
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:04,262
- Kind of where you end up
your ride on a horse

988
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:05,961
is so important, you guys.

989
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:08,230
It's a little bit like
when you guys were younger

990
00:47:08,258 --> 00:47:09,896
and you were dating.

991
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:11,463
That last two minutes
of the date

992
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,475
can be a real deal breaker.

993
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:16,239
With these horses,
it's the same thing, you know?

994
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:18,678
You got to quit
on a good note.

995
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:20,477
That was a good day.

996
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:25,078
All right,
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

997
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:28,146
- Raspberry and peach cobbler,
which would you like?

998
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:29,589
- Going for raspberry.

999
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:31,923
- Oh, that one?

1000
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:34,429
- Hey, Buck, why don't you do
some rope tricks?

1001
00:47:48,265 --> 00:47:50,472
- This is kind of
a tricky one here.

1002
00:48:01,278 --> 00:48:02,916
This is the move
I used to always do for Mary

1003
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:05,392
when I was trying
to trap her.

1004
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:09,921
[laughter]

1005
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:14,863
[dog barking]

1006
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:19,197
[people cheering]

1007
00:48:20,597 --> 00:48:23,806
- He was just
a very ordinary boy,

1008
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:26,838
didn't show signs
of early genius.

1009
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:28,372
- [laughs]

1010
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:30,612
Thanks, Mom.

1011
00:48:32,342 --> 00:48:35,619
- There was one point he thought
maybe his trick roping

1012
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:39,093
would be his avenue
to success,

1013
00:48:39,116 --> 00:48:44,429
but when he first saw Ray Hunt
doing his thing,

1014
00:48:44,454 --> 00:48:48,266
he was so fascinated,
he focused on that.

1015
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:51,296
[cheers and applause]

1016
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:01,742
- Pretty much anybody that's
been involved in the horse world

1017
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,275
knows Ray Hunt,

1018
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:07,778
and Ray brought this style
of horsemanship to the world.

1019
00:49:07,811 --> 00:49:11,452
Tom Dorrance was sort of
the godfather of all of this.

1020
00:49:11,481 --> 00:49:12,960
- Tom Dorrance taught Ray Hunt.

1021
00:49:12,983 --> 00:49:15,156
Ray Hunt taught Buck Brannaman

1022
00:49:15,185 --> 00:49:17,165
That's kind of the lineage,
as it were.

1023
00:49:17,187 --> 00:49:21,431
- I met Ray right after
I got out of high school.

1024
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:23,131
One of my teachers
told me about this guy

1025
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,071
that could start a horse
and get on him

1026
00:49:25,095 --> 00:49:26,403
in just a few minutes

1027
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:28,341
and ride him around
with no bridle on,

1028
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:30,504
and I thought, "Right"

1029
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:32,172
I'd grown up on a ranch.

1030
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:33,545
I was pretty punchy.

1031
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:35,208
Rode a lot of colts

1032
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:38,276
and a pretty fair bronc rider
for a kid.

1033
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:40,652
I thought, "Yeah,
another song-and-dance man,

1034
00:49:40,677 --> 00:49:42,281
some horse show dude."

1035
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:45,486
I had an opportunity
to go get this cowboying job

1036
00:49:45,515 --> 00:49:47,791
at a place called
Madison River Cattle Company.

1037
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:50,264
They said, "Well, in order
for you to get hired,

1038
00:49:50,287 --> 00:49:52,062
"you're gonna have to go talk
to the manager,

1039
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:53,591
and he's at a Ray Hunt clinic."

1040
00:49:53,623 --> 00:49:57,196
And I thought, "Aw, great.
Here's this Ray Hunt guy again."

1041
00:49:57,227 --> 00:49:59,503
So I go into the fairgrounds

1042
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:01,202
Sat about as far away
as I could

1043
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:05,179
so that I could show that
I was not interested in this.

1044
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:07,273
And then in come Ray Hunt.

1045
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:09,875
I saw him do more things with
a horse in a couple of minutes

1046
00:50:09,906 --> 00:50:12,352
than I'd ever figured anybody
could do with a horse.

1047
00:50:15,545 --> 00:50:17,991
He worked with a colt
that was pretty touchy,

1048
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:19,221
and I had been around enough

1049
00:50:19,249 --> 00:50:21,855
to know what
a touchy horse looked like.

1050
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:35,409
You could tell the horse
truly understood

1051
00:50:35,432 --> 00:50:37,503
what he was expecting of her.

1052
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,741
He could take those feet
anywhere he wanted.

1053
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:41,545
They were his feet.

1054
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:43,812
It was just an extension
of him.

1055
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:48,621
It was like a beautiful dance.

1056
00:50:48,645 --> 00:50:50,488
I took right to it
as soon as I saw it.

1057
00:50:50,514 --> 00:50:52,790
I thought, "I don't even know
what it is,

1058
00:50:52,816 --> 00:50:56,662
but whatever it is,
I need this."

1059
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:01,093
So that was the beginning
for me.

1060
00:51:01,124 --> 00:51:03,195
I went to Ray's clinics,
if not every week,

1061
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:04,864
every other week,

1062
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:07,034
for the next
four or five years.

1063
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:09,601
I was right down in the arena
hanging over the round Corral

1064
00:51:09,633 --> 00:51:12,773
watching this guy lift a rein
or move afoot.

1065
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:14,612
I might not have known
all what he was doing,

1066
00:51:14,638 --> 00:51:16,208
but I was seeing it.

1067
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:18,947
We got to be very close,

1068
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:23,287
and even though he said
it wasn't that important

1069
00:51:23,313 --> 00:51:28,387
that I pleased him
or that people pleased him,

1070
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:32,889
I looked for his approval,

1071
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:36,097
you know, the same way you would
a father figure.

1072
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:41,098
And later on,
when Ray passed away,

1073
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:44,078
I shed way more tears for him
than I ever did my dad.

1074
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:47,207
Now, you guys don't have to ride
like Ray Hunt or Tom Dorrance,

1075
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:50,047
but that's the choice I made.

1076
00:51:50,073 --> 00:51:51,950
First clinic I ever did,

1077
00:51:51,975 --> 00:51:54,319
I probably wasn't, you know,
a real effective teacher.

1078
00:51:54,344 --> 00:51:56,346
I was a pretty decent hand
by then.

1079
00:51:56,379 --> 00:51:59,417
I could get a little bit
of stuff done with a horse.

1080
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:03,693
But I'm sure I just sounded like
I was parodying Ray Hunt.

1081
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:07,964
I didn't have anything original
of my own to really talk about,

1082
00:52:07,991 --> 00:52:12,269
and I was so introverted
at the time,

1083
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:14,434
and I felt so uncomfortable.

1084
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:16,808
I committed right then
that I was gonna do enough

1085
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:20,303
little local clinics
to conquer that.

1086
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:23,341
- Buck has worked so hard
to overcome his shyness

1087
00:52:23,373 --> 00:52:25,375
The clinics were so small
when he first started,

1088
00:52:25,408 --> 00:52:27,354
he would offer to haul
the horses for free

1089
00:52:27,377 --> 00:52:29,584
just to get 'em to go
to his clinic.

1090
00:52:29,613 --> 00:52:32,594
And he couldn't have eye Contact
with you.

1091
00:52:32,616 --> 00:52:34,618
I mean, he was very shy,

1092
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:38,622
and to see him work that hard
to overcome that-

1093
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:40,464
and I think it amazes him
to this day

1094
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:43,767
that people want to even listen
to what he has to say.

1095
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:47,673
- Ray used to say that
he thought horsemen were born,

1096
00:52:47,697 --> 00:52:52,373
but an average person
can be extraordinary at this.

1097
00:52:52,402 --> 00:52:57,476
But if you don't have any guts,
if you don't have any try,

1098
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:59,714
you'd be damn lucky
to be ordinary.

[cows mooing]

1100
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:12,764
You're gonna find out
what it's like

1101
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:14,700
to actually use a horse

1102
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:17,568
and how nice they can be
when they get used.

1103
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:20,598
To work a horse properly
on a cow,

1104
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:22,906
that's the coolest feeling
there is.

1105
00:53:24,668 --> 00:53:26,875
Let the games begin.

1106
00:53:31,341 --> 00:53:33,048
I want you to be able
to learn things

1107
00:53:33,076 --> 00:53:34,919
and do things in real life

1108
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:37,789
if you were on a ranch
where you had a job to do.

1109
00:53:41,017 --> 00:53:43,554
It's one turn
and then a race.

1110
00:53:43,587 --> 00:53:45,863
One turn and then a race.

1111
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,562
Give him a job.

1112
00:53:47,591 --> 00:53:49,935
Figure out how to build
on the horse's pride.

1113
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,201
Make him feel good
about himself.

1114
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:55,005
And I wasn't just talking
about the horse.

1115
00:53:55,031 --> 00:53:56,806
Reata, that's good.

1116
00:53:56,833 --> 00:53:58,107
- Nice, nice.

1117
00:53:58,134 --> 00:53:59,272
- Mary.

1118
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:04,012
As long as you can stay
between your cow and the herd,

1119
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,451
you're in charge.

1120
00:54:05,475 --> 00:54:08,979
- Dang, out.
I'm out.

1121
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:10,719
See what happens
when you're married to him?

1122
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:11,851
- Britt, you're up.

1123
00:54:11,881 --> 00:54:15,158
Go move that cow.

1124
00:54:15,185 --> 00:54:16,721
- There's really nothing
more fun

1125
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:19,359
than chasing cows at top speed
and just trying to react.

1126
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:21,266
That's crazy fun,
but that's not really

1127
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:23,168
what you're supposed to do.

1128
00:54:23,193 --> 00:54:25,730
So it's this constant battle
to bring it back

1129
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:27,298
to some place
that's controlled.

1130
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:28,331
- Stop.

1131
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:30,242
See, you turned
without stopping.

1132
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:31,746
- You know,
that's the other half

1133
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:34,612
of why this is
a really interesting thing,

1134
00:54:34,638 --> 00:54:37,084
'cause it carries over into
every other aspect of your life,

1135
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:39,644
and I think it's made me
a more resourceful

1136
00:54:39,676 --> 00:54:41,986
and balanced human being

1137
00:54:42,012 --> 00:54:45,824
on top of just less likely
to get killed on a horse.

1138
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:49,296
-I love working cattle
with my dressage horses.

1139
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:51,560
I think it's fabulous for them,

1140
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:54,034
because dressage is a sport

1141
00:54:54,057 --> 00:54:57,231
where there are really fine
ballet-type movements

1142
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:59,740
that you're asking the horse
to do.

1143
00:54:59,763 --> 00:55:02,744
It gives meaning and purpose
to the dressage work,

1144
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:05,246
and then when you take
that purpose

1145
00:55:05,268 --> 00:55:07,214
back into the dressage ring,

1146
00:55:07,237 --> 00:55:10,548
the horse says,
"I'm practicing working cows,"

1147
00:55:10,573 --> 00:55:12,746
and it makes sense
to the horse,

1148
00:55:12,776 --> 00:55:14,619
and then he will do it
with a greater joy,

1149
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:16,214
because it has meaning to him.

1150
00:55:16,246 --> 00:55:18,157
It's not simply an exercise.

1151
00:55:18,181 --> 00:55:22,994
And I think that dressage work
gives the cow horse skills

1152
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:24,862
that even cowboys could use.

[cattle mooing]

- There you go.

1155
00:55:27,891 --> 00:55:30,531
- Horses get discouraged
by riders who shut the doors,

1156
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:33,507
and Buck's really good
at opening doors.

1157
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:36,136
And you get to artwork
or anything else that you do,

1158
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:38,646
you start to look at it
for the open doors,

1159
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:40,841
and then you learn
how to walk through those.

1160
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:44,750
- You guys want to throw
a few heel shots?

1161
00:55:56,953 --> 00:55:59,729
- I knew that Buck
was really a special guy,

1162
00:55:59,756 --> 00:56:02,635
and because of his background,
which I learned about,

1163
00:56:02,659 --> 00:56:05,503
and the abuse
that he had suffered as a kid,

1164
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:06,700
it was even more impressive

1165
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:08,232
that he could come
through that abuse

1166
00:56:08,264 --> 00:56:09,402
and, rather than repeating it,

1167
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:11,070
that he went the other way
and decided,

1168
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:13,308
"I'm not gonna have that
in my life."

And how about you, Dan?
What's your stage name?

1173
00:56:21,244 --> 00:56:23,588
- They call me Buckshot,
and I'm seven years old.

1174
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:25,320
- Well, who taught you
to perform?

1175
00:56:25,348 --> 00:56:26,554
- Our father did.

right?

1177

Did he ever do this type
of thing?

Was he - did he ever do...

1179
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:35,328
- The way my dad treated me

- We've arranged a short
demonstration, right, fellas?

00:56:39,996 --> 00:56:43,910
- I wouldn't attribute
any of my positive virtues

1183
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:48,075
to my dad in any way whatsoever.

1184
00:56:48,104 --> 00:56:50,209
I know you're not supposed
to hate anybody,

1185
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:55,690
but the hurt that he caused me,
I never really got over it.

1186
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:58,750
So I live in the moment.

1187
00:56:58,782 --> 00:57:00,659
I like to live in the moment.

You worry about yesterday
or last week or 20 years ago,

it's not gonna work out
too good for you.

1190
00:57:07,724 --> 00:57:10,364
You can't live
in two places at once.

1191
00:57:10,393 --> 00:57:11,997
You know,
I mean, you never forget,

1192
00:57:12,028 --> 00:57:15,339
but you don't have
to keep living in the past.

1193
00:57:15,365 --> 00:57:17,675
I mean, there's a whole bunch
of things I learned

1194
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:19,407
from all the dark stuff
that happened to me.

1195
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:21,143
There's a hell of a lot
of things I learned.

1196
00:57:21,171 --> 00:57:23,617
Now, I wouldn't necessarily
recommend it to anybody,

1197
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:27,213
but it made me what I am.

1198
00:57:29,813 --> 00:57:32,657
Yeah, it got a little warm there
for a while today, didn't it?

1199
00:57:32,682 --> 00:57:34,491
Thank goodness my daughter-

1200
00:57:34,517 --> 00:57:37,555
she's never gone through
anything like that,

1201
00:57:37,587 --> 00:57:40,261
and now she's almost
grown up, so...

1202
00:57:41,491 --> 00:57:42,993
You can just saddle them
inside the round Corral.

1203
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:49,640
I think if a kid is living
in an environment

1204
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:51,339
like I was when I was little,

1205
00:57:51,367 --> 00:57:53,643
sometimes the way
you protect yourself is,

1206
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:55,672
you just really
don't communicate with anybody,

1207
00:57:55,705 --> 00:57:58,413
and you try your best
not to be noticed,

1208
00:57:58,441 --> 00:58:00,546
and you just sort of withdraw,

1209
00:58:00,577 --> 00:58:04,184
and you'll see a horse sometimes
that they've been mashed on

1210
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:07,195
by somebody to where
you just look in their eyes,

1211
00:58:07,217 --> 00:58:08,491
and they look
like they're dead.

1212
00:58:08,518 --> 00:58:11,897
Yet that's the time when you try
to encourage your kid

1213
00:58:11,921 --> 00:58:14,128
to be outgoing
and gregarious

1214
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:17,104
and be able to talk to not only
other kids but adults.

1215
00:58:17,126 --> 00:58:19,538
Then just see if you can rope
him right out of his tracks,

1216
00:58:19,562 --> 00:58:21,269
'cause that's what you might
have to do

1217
00:58:21,297 --> 00:58:23,072
if you're gonna jump out
of your tracks

1218
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:24,339
on a cow or something.

1219
00:58:24,367 --> 00:58:27,143
You know what I mean?
There.

1220
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:28,774
[laughs]

1221
00:58:28,805 --> 00:58:29,909
- He got it.

1222
00:58:29,939 --> 00:58:32,943
- He kind of got it done
in spite of you, didn't he?

1223
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:35,456
- Dang it.

1224
00:58:35,478 --> 00:58:37,458
- We'll make a cowgirl
out of you yet.

1225
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:40,017
- You're only doing this
so you can laugh.

1226
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:41,323
- [laughs]

1227
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:44,628
Reata and I
are an awful lot alike.

1228
00:58:44,654 --> 00:58:47,999
Thank goodness she kind of
has her mother's looks.

1229
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:50,561
Mentally,
she's a lot like I am.

1230
00:58:50,593 --> 00:58:54,439
You know, Mary'll say,
sometimes in frustration,

1231
00:58:54,464 --> 00:58:56,034
"She's just like you,"

1232
00:58:56,065 --> 00:58:59,842
and I think,
"What's the downside to that?"

1233
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:02,076
[laughs]

1234
00:59:02,105 --> 00:59:05,712
But she may not be seeing it
just that way at the time.

1235
00:59:05,742 --> 00:59:08,621
And I look at her
and the way she's developed,

1236
00:59:08,645 --> 00:59:11,182
and I think, "I probably
could have been that way

1237
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:12,887
when I was her age."

1238
00:59:12,916 --> 00:59:14,691
That was in there all the while.

1239
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:15,889
- Do it again.

1240
00:59:15,919 --> 00:59:17,296
- There.

1241
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,163
That was a little better.

1242
00:59:19,188 --> 00:59:21,225
- Yeah, I could feel it.

1243
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:36,683
- Buck, either before
you get settled

1244
00:59:36,706 --> 00:59:37,776
or when you get settled,

1245
00:59:37,807 --> 00:59:39,252
you signed these books
last year,

1246
00:59:39,275 --> 00:59:40,811
and I need a translation.

1247
00:59:40,843 --> 00:59:43,016
It's Spanish or Latin.

1248
00:59:43,046 --> 00:59:44,787
- Latin.

1249
00:59:44,814 --> 00:59:47,351
Solvitur en modo.
Firmitur en ray.

1250
00:59:47,383 --> 00:59:51,388
"Gentle in what you do,
firm in how you do it."

1251
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:53,128
Yep.
- Good words.

1252
00:59:53,156 --> 00:59:54,760
- How are you, Charlene?
Nice to see you.

1253
00:59:54,791 --> 00:59:56,202
- it's good to see you.

1254
00:59:56,225 --> 00:59:58,432
I wanted to tell you I was all
signed up to ride with you,

1255
00:59:58,461 --> 00:59:59,997
and a couple of weeks
before the clinic,

1256
01:00:00,029 --> 01:00:01,133
I found out I'm having a baby.

1257
01:00:01,164 --> 01:00:03,474
- Well, all right.
- Good for you.

1258
01:00:03,499 --> 01:00:04,807
- I always learn
even when I'm watching.

1259
01:00:04,834 --> 01:00:05,938
- Good, all right.

1260
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:09,041
Okay, you guys can come on over

1261
01:00:09,072 --> 01:00:10,813
neart he round corral here

1262
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,751
where you can get
a good chance to see.

1263
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:15,016
I'll work with this one
first here.

1264
01:00:15,044 --> 01:00:17,024
Evidently he's a little naughty.

1265
01:00:19,382 --> 01:00:22,454
I guess you can see
a little disrespect there, huh?

1266
01:00:22,485 --> 01:00:25,159
He had to come up and stick
his nose right in my face.

1267
01:00:25,188 --> 01:00:27,327
So I'll work with him,

1268
01:00:27,357 --> 01:00:32,898
and we'll see the same things
on about all the Colts, but...

1269
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:34,533
- Dan?

1270
01:00:34,564 --> 01:00:35,702
This guy's a paint,

1271
01:00:35,732 --> 01:00:38,713
and he was an orphan
as a baby,

1272
01:00:38,735 --> 01:00:41,511
and he was oxygen-deprived,
apparently.

1273
01:00:41,537 --> 01:00:44,381
Dan, do you want to-

1274
01:00:44,407 --> 01:00:45,977
which way do you guys
want to bring him in?

1275
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:47,920
- I'm gonna talk to Buck,
see if he wants him or not.

1276
01:00:47,944 --> 01:00:49,218
He may want to-

1277
01:00:49,245 --> 01:00:51,748
'cause that horse might hold up
the whole progress

1278
01:00:51,781 --> 01:00:52,953
of the whole class.

1279
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:54,052
- So wait until noon.

1280
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:55,289
- So he might want
to wait until, yeah,

1281
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:56,854
when it's convenient for Buck.

1282
01:00:56,886 --> 01:00:59,162
Maybe even after the whole deal.
I don't know.

1283
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:05,100
- I think we have a problem
child we have to work yet.

1284
01:01:05,128 --> 01:01:07,938
All right, you can bring
that one on in, Dan.

1285
01:01:07,964 --> 01:01:11,844
They make it sound like they're
bringing in a Siberian tiger.

1286
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:24,181
Was he hard to catch
even in the trailer, Dan?

1287
01:01:24,213 --> 01:01:26,591
- He just kind of wanted to be
a little aggressive in there.

1288
01:01:26,616 --> 01:01:29,495
Bite maybe.
- Uh-huh.

1289
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:31,829
- just a lot of threatening,
you know?

1290
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:33,390
- How old is he?

1291
01:01:33,423 --> 01:01:34,629
- He's three.

1292
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:36,796
- Uh-huh, how much
have you worked with him?

1293
01:01:42,398 --> 01:01:44,105
I got my back broken
in two places.

1294
01:01:44,133 --> 01:01:46,272
So he has not been handled.

1295
01:01:46,302 --> 01:01:49,442
- So he was more or less raised
like an orphan.

1296
01:01:49,472 --> 01:01:50,712
- Yeah.

1297
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:52,378
- Those can be the worst kind.

1298
01:01:52,408 --> 01:01:53,716
The orphans are always
the worst,

1299
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:55,745
'cause they don't learn anything
about respect

1300
01:01:55,778 --> 01:01:57,553
that they would have learned
from their mother

1301
01:01:57,580 --> 01:01:59,821
or from other horses.

1302
01:01:59,849 --> 01:02:04,889
They don't respect anything
or anybody.

1303
01:02:04,921 --> 01:02:06,366
- You know, people thought
I should put him down.

1304
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:08,062
They thought maybe he had
some brain damage.

1305
01:02:08,091 --> 01:02:12,039
He's extremely dangerous,
and he attacks cars.

1306
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:14,473
- I'm sure you're anxious
to get that one in here, Dan.

1307
01:02:16,332 --> 01:02:17,436
Don't get hit.

1308
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:19,071
Step in behind him there.

1309
01:02:19,102 --> 01:02:20,809
- When he was an orphan,
I didn't have a barn,

1310
01:02:20,837 --> 01:02:22,874
'cause my house burned down,
and my barn burned down.

1311
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:24,680
So I raised him-

1312
01:02:24,707 --> 01:02:26,243
It was cool, so I raised him
in the house.

1313
01:02:26,275 --> 01:02:27,481
It was cold, and l-

1314
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:29,387
so I bottle-fed him
every couple of hours.

1315
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:33,258
And I-how do you say it-
potty-trained him.

1316
01:02:33,282 --> 01:02:34,852
It started out
a good relationship.

1317
01:02:34,884 --> 01:02:40,163
It's just, somebody else
has to come in and help me.

1318
01:02:41,958 --> 01:02:44,962
He's different.

1319
01:02:44,994 --> 01:02:46,371
- And he's a stud too?

1320
01:02:49,832 --> 01:02:51,971
- Yeah, I'd do that
the sooner, the better.

1321
01:02:52,001 --> 01:02:54,242
I mean, it looks to me
like the last thing you need

1322
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:55,681
is a damn stud.

1323
01:02:55,705 --> 01:02:58,117
If you're gonna have one,
a lot of you guys,

1324
01:02:58,141 --> 01:03:00,451
you just as well get you
a grizzly bear, an orangutan

1325
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:05,983
- I've known Buck
for over 20 years,

1326
01:03:06,015 --> 01:03:11,761
and I've seen one other horse
besides Kelly, a stallion,

1327
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:13,324
that stands out,

1328
01:03:13,356 --> 01:03:16,565
but I've never ever witnessed
anything quite like that,

1329
01:03:16,592 --> 01:03:19,129
that dangerous
and unpredictable.

1330
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:39,353
- Is somebody planning
on trimming his feet someday?

1331
01:03:39,382 --> 01:03:43,262
- Yeah.
- Any sheers here?

1332
01:03:43,286 --> 01:03:45,892
Come on, you cowards.

1333
01:03:45,922 --> 01:03:47,526
You want to shoe him right now,

1334
01:03:47,557 --> 01:03:49,935
or would you rather
I got him a little better?

1335
01:03:49,959 --> 01:03:52,997
You're booked.

1336
01:03:53,029 --> 01:03:55,066
'Cause Dah's gonna saddle him
and ride him around here

1337
01:03:55,097 --> 01:03:57,668
in a minute.

1338
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:00,806
A lot of you that don't
understand much about a rope,

1339
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:02,783
you'll find out I can stop him,

1340
01:04:02,805 --> 01:04:05,183
and that's gonna come in handy
for you, Dan.

1341
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:06,312
When you're on him,

1342
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:09,221
you're gonna be real glad
that I can stop him,

1343
01:04:09,245 --> 01:04:12,124
once you understand now much
more control I have by hind foot

1344
01:04:12,148 --> 01:04:14,958
than I would by a halter
on his head.

1345
01:04:14,984 --> 01:04:16,486
You already know
you can't control him

1346
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:17,497
with a halter on his head,

1347
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,193
'cause he's been
chewing on people

1348
01:04:19,222 --> 01:04:21,896
and has already been aggressive
and wanting to attack people.

1349
01:04:21,924 --> 01:04:23,426
Hey, want you guys
to understand.

1350
01:04:23,459 --> 01:04:25,063
You can't hold it against him

1351
01:04:25,094 --> 01:04:26,539
for kind of how
his life has been.

1352
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:32,103
Little bit, he'll lead soft.

1353
01:04:32,134 --> 01:04:33,977
Okay, Dan, you can come on in.

1354
01:04:34,003 --> 01:04:36,415
We're just gonna kind of
love on him for right now.

1355
01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:38,976
You just kind of ease up
beside him and just pet him.

1356
01:04:41,244 --> 01:04:42,723
Come on over with your blanket.

1357
01:04:42,745 --> 01:04:44,656
You'll just go up
and rub him.

1358
01:04:47,683 --> 01:04:49,594
Yeah, good.

1359
01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:51,326
Good.
Go get your saddle.

1360
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:54,993
And you kind of-
While his frame of mind

1361
01:04:55,024 --> 01:04:56,594
is kind of humble like that,

1362
01:04:56,626 --> 01:04:59,436
you can cuddle him
and kind of love on him too,

1363
01:04:59,462 --> 01:05:00,964
so just pet him
on the hind leg.

1364
01:05:00,997 --> 01:05:03,409
Now just see if you can
just gently pick up the hoof.

1365
01:05:03,432 --> 01:05:04,536
That's the way.

1366
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:05,568
There you go.

1367
01:05:05,601 --> 01:05:07,103
You can go around the front.

1368
01:05:07,136 --> 01:05:09,776
Rub him on his face there
when he's being a good guy.

1369
01:05:09,805 --> 01:05:10,977
Watch him, though.

1370
01:05:11,007 --> 01:05:12,918
Block him when he wants
to bite you, block, block.

1371
01:05:12,942 --> 01:05:15,513
That's the biggest thing is,
nobody's ever blocked him.

1372
01:05:15,544 --> 01:05:18,286
- We had to put up a sign
that says "attack horse,"

1373
01:05:18,314 --> 01:05:20,794
because if somebody did
walk into the pasture,

1374
01:05:20,816 --> 01:05:23,126
he would have taken 'em out.

1375
01:05:23,152 --> 01:05:25,792
One time, some people
started teasing him,

1376
01:05:25,821 --> 01:05:28,165
and I went up to him
about 12 feet away

1377
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:29,225
in this golf cart,

1378
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:31,067
thinking that would bring him
away from the fence,

1379
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:33,039
and instead
he looked back at me,

1380
01:05:33,062 --> 01:05:34,507
pinned his ears,
ducked his head,

1381
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:36,601
and did that aggressive
horse behavior

1382
01:05:36,632 --> 01:05:38,236
and came right at me.

1383
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:40,770
Going, striking, feet,
everything,

1384
01:05:40,803 --> 01:05:42,942
and he pretty much came up
over the golf cart

1385
01:05:42,972 --> 01:05:44,542
and nailed me.

1386
01:05:44,573 --> 01:05:47,110
- Now go for a little walk
with him.

1387
01:05:51,881 --> 01:05:54,487
Now we're gonna stop him.

1388
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:56,258
Pet him.

1389
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:58,526
You're the good cop
there, Dan.

1390
01:05:58,554 --> 01:05:59,828
You just love on him.

1391
01:05:59,855 --> 01:06:02,267
Rub him down that hind leg.

1392
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:03,599
Looks good.

1393
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:06,106
Just get on him
like he's Grandma's horse.

1394
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:08,233
All right.

1395
01:06:08,264 --> 01:06:10,835
Pick your lead rope up
so it's not dragging there.

1396
01:06:10,866 --> 01:06:13,676
So you can kind of bend him
if you need to, to the left.

1397
01:06:13,703 --> 01:06:14,977
Pet him.

1398
01:06:15,004 --> 01:06:16,210
You just rub him all over

1399
01:06:16,238 --> 01:06:19,845
like you're
just totally in love.

Okay, walk off again.

1402

Yeah, go ahead,

"Come on.
Let's go, Yeller."

We don't want him to think

1412

back there,

Good job.
I'm gonna stop you now.

1415
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:55,752
Okay, you can step off him
nice and clean.

This isn't open for discussion.

At this point,

to lead this horse anywhere,

1419

and then later on,

01:07:05,421 --> 01:07:07,423
maybe a little short
evening session,

1421

you can work him on the end
of your lead rope in here

when it's just you and him
by yourself.

1423
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:16,870
- I was really embarrassed,

1424
01:07:16,899 --> 01:07:19,175
because he said nobody
should have a stud horse,

1425
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:20,703
and I'm thinking,
"God, if he only knew

1426
01:07:20,736 --> 01:07:23,683

at home, that I have,"

well, it's healed up
pretty well,

but I'm gonna have that
the rest of my life, yeah.

And, hell, the safest place
around this son of a bitch

is on him.

You felt fine
when you were on him.

But around him on the ground,
he's treacherous

And he could hurt Dan or me
or you or anybody else

just in being spoiled,

1440
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:12,156
and he doesn't want
to be that way,

1441
01:08:12,188 --> 01:08:14,794
but he doesn't know
any other way to be.

1442
01:08:16,392 --> 01:08:19,066
He's as close to having been
turned into a predator

I'm telling you that.

Most people don't need studs,

they don't need 18 of them.

1552
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:28,905
[Buck clears throat]

1553
01:13:38,013 --> 01:13:40,550
Come on, Kel.
Come on.

1554
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:42,653
- Just sit still.

1555
01:13:42,684 --> 01:13:44,686
Just wait.

1556
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:48,993
[sighs]

1557
01:13:50,526 --> 01:13:52,301
- Come on, Kel.
Come on, Kel.

1558
01:13:52,327 --> 01:13:53,738
Come on.
Up.

1559
01:13:53,762 --> 01:13:56,140
-Sit still.
Just sit still.

1560
01:14:01,003 --> 01:14:02,004
Just sit still.

1561
01:14:02,037 --> 01:14:04,017
Just don't do anything.

1562
01:14:57,493 --> 01:14:59,905
[gate clattering]

1563
01:15:33,395 --> 01:15:36,638
Okay, we'll see if you have
any questions here.

1564
01:15:41,937 --> 01:15:44,349
Well, I'll talk to you
right now.

1565
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:45,613
The colt, when it was born,

1566
01:15:45,641 --> 01:15:48,554
was not breathing
when they got to it,

1567
01:15:48,577 --> 01:15:49,885
and they didn't know
for how long.

1568
01:15:49,912 --> 01:15:51,289
So the vet even figured

1569
01:15:51,313 --> 01:15:53,293
that the horse
had been oxygen-deprived

1570
01:15:53,315 --> 01:15:55,420
for quite along period of time,

1571
01:15:55,450 --> 01:15:58,431
but he still could have made it
in spite of his handicap

1572
01:15:58,453 --> 01:16:00,262
that he was born with.

1573
01:16:00,289 --> 01:16:01,962
He could have made it.

1574
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:05,802
If you just would treat this
as if that horse,

1575
01:16:05,827 --> 01:16:08,398
because of
the oxygen deprivation,

1576
01:16:08,430 --> 01:16:11,604
had some sort
of a learning disability.

1577
01:16:11,633 --> 01:16:14,204
Well, number one,
they should have worked with him

1578
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:16,273
like you might work
with a disabled child

1579
01:16:16,305 --> 01:16:21,015
and said, "Look, you might need
a little bit of extra education

1580
01:16:21,043 --> 01:16:24,320
because of where
you're coming from."

1581
01:16:24,346 --> 01:16:26,553
So you could have taken
that disabled child

1582
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:29,722
and turned him
into something of value

1583
01:16:29,751 --> 01:16:31,731
to himself and everyone else,

1584
01:16:31,753 --> 01:16:34,597
and he may have ended up
just a kind, nice little horse

1585
01:16:34,623 --> 01:16:36,830
that didn't have a lot
to offer mentally

1586
01:16:36,858 --> 01:16:39,065
but was just kind of
okay with people,

1587
01:16:39,094 --> 01:16:40,664
and he might have
packed someone around.

1588
01:16:40,696 --> 01:16:45,543
He might have been the absolute
opposite of what he is.

1589
01:16:45,567 --> 01:16:49,242
But you know damn good and well,
she would go home,

1590
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:51,911
and she would either get hurt,
get killed,

1591
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:55,251
or someone else would get hurt
that was totally innocent.

1592
01:16:55,277 --> 01:16:57,416
The human failed that horse.

1593
01:16:57,446 --> 01:17:01,952
The human is that X factor.

1594
01:17:01,984 --> 01:17:03,622
That horse is a mirror.

1595
01:17:03,652 --> 01:17:06,394
All your horses are a mirror
to your soul.

1596
01:17:08,357 --> 01:17:12,032
And sometimes you might not like
what you see in the mirror.

1597
01:17:14,196 --> 01:17:16,802
Sometimes you will.

1598
01:17:20,335 --> 01:17:22,975
- What were you thinking
when you were just being

1599
01:17:23,005 --> 01:17:26,248
so kind and patient
with that horse

1600
01:17:26,274 --> 01:17:28,686
to get him in there
instead of just,

1601
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:31,350
"You're no good,"
shut the door, and go?

1602
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:36,887
- To have contempt for the horse
never would even occur to me.

1603
01:17:36,918 --> 01:17:39,421
That's not-

1604
01:17:39,454 --> 01:17:43,197
You can't blame the whole
damn thing on somebody else.

1605
01:17:43,225 --> 01:17:46,035
One of the biggest challenges
of a horseman is,

1606
01:17:46,061 --> 01:17:48,234
is to be able to control
your emotions,

1607
01:17:48,263 --> 01:17:49,469
and it's a-

1608
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:52,809
you know, probably
more of a challenge for me-

1609
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:54,438
has been, you know,
not so much now,

1610
01:17:54,469 --> 01:17:55,743
but it has been-

1611
01:17:55,771 --> 01:18:01,551
because my dad
had a violent temper.

1612
01:18:01,576 --> 01:18:04,079
He was a terrifying person.

1613
01:18:04,112 --> 01:18:09,061
So that kind of followed me
around a little bit, thinking,

1614
01:18:09,084 --> 01:18:12,759
"Am I gonna be just like
that old fart," you know?

1615
01:18:12,788 --> 01:18:13,926
No.

1616
01:18:13,955 --> 01:18:15,298
No, you got a choice.

1617
01:18:15,323 --> 01:18:16,734
You can make choices.

1618
01:18:16,758 --> 01:18:20,035
You can't blame the whole
damn thing on somebody else.

1619
01:18:20,062 --> 01:18:22,235
And, you know,
I can't help but think

1620
01:18:22,264 --> 01:18:25,245
that all you guys here,
when you have a youngster,

1621
01:18:25,267 --> 01:18:26,678
that you're gonna be thinking,

1622
01:18:26,702 --> 01:18:28,807
"Hoo, hoo, hoo,
I've got some responsibility.

1623
01:18:28,837 --> 01:18:31,010
"I'm gonna take care of things
and try to make this

1624
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:32,848
"as good a life for him
as I can

1625
01:18:32,874 --> 01:18:34,945
"and not let things
get out of hand

1626
01:18:34,976 --> 01:18:37,650
and teach him something,"
I hope.

1627
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:38,749
I hope.

1628
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:45,354
[engine revving]

1629
01:18:52,761 --> 01:18:56,231
So we're headed from Chico
to Red Bluff

1630
01:18:56,264 --> 01:19:00,906
to the stock horse
and ranch roping contest there.

1631
01:19:00,936 --> 01:19:04,907
The Californios is the deal
every year in Red Bluff.

1632
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:08,717
Buckaroo, vaquero-style roping,
this is it.

1633
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:10,985
Reata's doing the kid's class.

1634
01:19:11,012 --> 01:19:13,219
They call it
the heritage class.

1635
01:19:13,248 --> 01:19:15,728
She's really looking forward
to that,

1636
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:19,289
and this'll be her last year
to do the kid's class.

1637
01:19:19,321 --> 01:19:21,392
Then she'll be too old.

1638
01:19:27,462 --> 01:19:30,068
- The Californios
is one of the highlights

1639
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:31,270
of my dad's season,

1640
01:19:31,299 --> 01:19:32,744
'cause he's been on the road
traveling,

1641
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:35,146
living in his horse trailer,
meeting a bunch of new people,

1642
01:19:35,170 --> 01:19:36,945
having to memorize
their names.

1643
01:19:36,972 --> 01:19:40,078
So I think it is definitely
one of his highlights.

1644
01:19:40,108 --> 01:19:42,714
- She won this event last year,
Reata Brannaman,

1645
01:19:42,744 --> 01:19:46,214
and she's showing
a lot of these guys

1646
01:19:46,248 --> 01:19:48,558
how to throw that thing.

1647
01:19:48,583 --> 01:19:50,358
- That's about
the most fun for me

1648
01:19:50,385 --> 01:19:53,264
is out there roping
with my daughter.

1649
01:19:54,489 --> 01:19:55,900
- She wants to be-

1650
01:19:55,924 --> 01:19:57,562
She emulates everything
her dad does.

1651
01:19:57,592 --> 01:19:59,594
She wants to be just like him.

1652
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:04,938
She's her father's daughter.

1653
01:20:04,966 --> 01:20:06,502
We did teach her how to ride,

1654
01:20:06,535 --> 01:20:07,912
but it was already in her.

1655
01:20:07,936 --> 01:20:10,246
She could ride
from the very beginning.

1656
01:20:10,272 --> 01:20:12,616
I mean, the very first time
I ever watched her rope,

1657
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:15,178
I thought,
"Who's been teaching you?"

1658
01:20:16,444 --> 01:20:18,856
- Okay, we're good to go.

1659
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:21,918
Reata Brannaman
and her lovely assistant.

1660
01:20:21,950 --> 01:20:24,260
- Yes, lovely assistant.

1661
01:20:24,286 --> 01:20:25,959
The way this works is,

1662
01:20:25,987 --> 01:20:28,661
they've got seven minutes
to do this.

1663
01:20:42,871 --> 01:20:44,680
[cheers and applause]

1664
01:20:44,706 --> 01:20:47,482
- Yeah!
Yeah!

1665
01:20:51,513 --> 01:20:53,151
- Gee, she's a handy kid.

1666
01:20:53,181 --> 01:20:56,458
Outropes most men now.

1667
01:20:56,484 --> 01:20:59,363
There'll come a time
when she'll be beating me,

1668
01:20:59,387 --> 01:21:00,923
and that'll be fine.

1669
01:21:00,956 --> 01:21:03,698
It'll be time
to turn it over to her.

1670
01:21:03,725 --> 01:21:05,432
Then I'll just sit around
in the grandstands

1671
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:08,236
and talk about all the stuff
I used to be.

1672
01:21:14,102 --> 01:21:16,844
But hopefully that'll be
about another 30, 40 years.

1673
01:21:19,407 --> 01:21:21,478
People say they're too old
when they're, like, 40,

1674
01:21:21,509 --> 01:21:24,615
and you think, "Shut up.

1675
01:21:24,646 --> 01:21:26,250
Too old."

1676
01:21:26,281 --> 01:21:30,423
Bill Dorrance was roping
when he was 94.

1677
01:21:30,452 --> 01:21:34,332
That's how I want to be
when I grow up, if I ever do.

1678
01:21:40,228 --> 01:21:43,266
Oh, it's always neat
to see them

1679
01:21:43,298 --> 01:21:47,269
after I've been gone
for a long time, yeah.

1680
01:21:47,302 --> 01:21:50,749
But it's always hard
to leave too.

1681
01:21:50,772 --> 01:21:53,616
You know, once you're
around them for a few days,

1682
01:21:53,642 --> 01:21:55,178
kind of start getting used
to being around them.

1683
01:21:55,210 --> 01:21:58,885
Then you go back
to your life of solitude.

1684
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:11,093
So I'm still on the move.

1685
01:22:11,126 --> 01:22:13,732
I'm getting better,
because I'm still studying.

1686
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:16,675
I still want to be
a better horsemen.

1687
01:22:21,436 --> 01:22:23,347
I've learned so many things,

1688
01:22:23,371 --> 01:22:27,148
and I thought originally
I was just gonna be there

1689
01:22:27,175 --> 01:22:29,781
to figure out
how to get a colt started

1690
01:22:29,811 --> 01:22:33,588
and figure out how to be
a little better cowboy.

1691
01:22:37,218 --> 01:22:39,425
That's what I thought
it was about.

1692
01:22:39,454 --> 01:22:42,492
Come to find out, that wasn't
what it was about at all.

1693
01:22:53,401 --> 01:22:55,403
Out of a group like this,

1694
01:22:55,437 --> 01:22:58,179
there might be some
who become artists,

1695
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:01,686
where you become creative,
and you use your imagination.

1696
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:05,180
Now, that was a thing
of beauty.

1697
01:23:05,213 --> 01:23:09,684
You look like one mind
and one body.

1698
01:23:11,186 --> 01:23:13,063
If you got a taste of it,

1699
01:23:13,088 --> 01:23:17,400
if you got a taste
of what I'm talking about,

1700
01:23:17,425 --> 01:23:20,133
you couldn't get enough of it.

1701
01:23:20,161 --> 01:23:21,572
You'd rather do that than eat.

1702
01:23:27,402 --> 01:23:31,282
You may spend your whole life
chasing that,

1703
01:23:31,306 --> 01:23:33,183
and that's possible,

1704
01:23:33,208 --> 01:23:35,984
but it's a good thing to chase.

1705
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:47,856
- This is Buck's favorite joke.

1706
01:24:47,882 --> 01:24:49,691
It's a pirate scene,

1707
01:24:49,717 --> 01:24:52,823
and the guy
up in the crow's nest says,

1708
01:24:52,854 --> 01:24:57,633
"One enemy ship coming
on the horizon!"

1709
01:24:57,659 --> 01:25:02,802
And the captain says,
"Quick, bring me my red shirt,

1710
01:25:02,831 --> 01:25:06,278
"because if I get wounded
in battle,

1711
01:25:06,301 --> 01:25:08,542
"the blood won't show,

1712
01:25:08,570 --> 01:25:10,743
and my men will fight on."

1713
01:25:10,772 --> 01:25:12,877
So they had the battle,

1714
01:25:12,907 --> 01:25:18,823
and after a bit,
the guy in the crow's nest says,

1715
01:25:18,847 --> 01:25:23,694
"Ten enemy ships
on the horizon!"

1716
01:25:23,718 --> 01:25:29,828
And the captain says, "Quick,
bring me my brown pants!"

1717
01:25:29,858 --> 01:25:31,929
[laughter]

1718
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:34,964
[cheers and applause]

1719
01:25:37,031 --> 01:25:40,012
[soft acoustic guitar music]

1720
01:25:40,034 --> 01:25:48,044
#

1721
01:25:53,515 --> 01:25:57,554
- # Yes, I understand
that every life must end #

1722
01:25:57,585 --> 01:26:02,330
# Uh-huh #

1723
01:26:02,357 --> 01:26:06,533
# As we sit alone,
I know someday we must go #

1724
01:26:06,561 --> 01:26:10,873
# Uh-huh #

1725
01:26:10,899 --> 01:26:14,870
# Oh, I'm a lucky man
to count on both hands #

1726
01:26:14,903 --> 01:26:19,977
# The ones I love #

1727
01:26:20,008 --> 01:26:22,079
# Some folks just have one #

1728
01:26:22,110 --> 01:26:24,215
# Yeah, others, they got none #

1729
01:26:24,245 --> 01:26:29,160
# Uh-huh #

1730
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:33,599
# Stay with me #

1731
01:26:33,621 --> 01:26:37,433
# Let's just breathe #

1732
01:26:37,458 --> 01:26:45,468
#

1733
01:26:47,702 --> 01:26:49,648
# Practiced on our sins #

1734
01:26:49,671 --> 01:26:51,947
# Never gonna let me win #

1735
01:26:51,973 --> 01:26:56,547
# Uh-huh #

1736
01:26:56,578 --> 01:27:00,788
# Under everything,
just another human being #

1737
01:27:00,815 --> 01:27:05,230
# Uh-huh #

1738
01:27:05,253 --> 01:27:07,290
# Yeah, I don't want to hurt #

1739
01:27:07,322 --> 01:27:14,638
# There's so much in this world
to make me believe #

1740
01:27:14,662 --> 01:27:19,168
# Stay with me #

1741
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:23,774
# All I see #

1742
01:27:23,805 --> 01:27:28,220
# Did I say that I need you? #

1743
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:32,282

# No one knows this
more than me #
