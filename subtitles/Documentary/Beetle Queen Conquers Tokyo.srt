3
00:00:11,902 --> 00:00:14,538
<font color="#808080">What are you saying?</font>

4
00:00:14,538 --> 00:00:17,441
<font color="#808080">He isn't stalking. We came together.</font>

5
00:00:17,441 --> 00:00:20,577
<font color="#808080">It was settled using my card.
You can confirm it if you want to know.</font>

6
00:00:20,577 --> 00:00:23,180
<font color="#808080">We sat apart so as not to be spotted.</font>

7
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,815
<font color="#808080">Do you understand?</font>

8
00:00:24,948 --> 00:00:28,352
<font color="#808080">So, call the police at once and tell them that it was a misunderstanding.</font>

9
00:00:28,352 --> 00:00:33,023
<font color="#808080">If you get the police involved, the two of us will be the victims.</font>

10
00:00:33,023 --> 00:00:36,193
<font color="#808080">I will not let you go for
invading people's private matters.</font>

11
00:00:50,741 --> 00:00:53,577
<font color="#808080">-What is this big reversal?
-Hilarious.</font>

12
00:00:53,577 --> 00:00:57,181
<font color="#808080">This is the truth, Han dong Min ha become a complete joke!</font>

13
00:00:57,181 --> 00:01:01,251
<font color="#808080">Ah, it's completely different from a minute ago.</font>

14
00:01:01,251 --> 00:01:04,555
<font color="#808080">What's this?
Even beating up people's lovers?</font>

15
00:01:04,555 --> 00:01:08,292
<font color="#808080">Aigoo, fool.</font>

16
00:01:23,306 --> 00:01:27,410
Then again, you should
know your limitations.

17
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:30,647
Thinking that you're able
to grasp the situation

18
00:01:30,647 --> 00:01:34,117
then ending up laughed at.

19
00:01:34,884 --> 00:01:36,920
Didn't I warn you?

20
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,155
You help fight for her
role and help publicize her.

21
00:01:39,155 --> 00:01:44,861
You go all out.
But you don't know what's going on behind your back.

22
00:01:45,795 --> 00:01:47,230
Why don't you just stop?

23
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:51,601
You fell into a hole. Well, you dug it yourself.

24
00:01:51,901 --> 00:01:59,309
How sweet... She spends her one day off
on a romantic getaway.

25
00:01:59,309 --> 00:02:00,810
Hey...

26
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,947
You know, the guy's quite handsome.

27
00:02:03,947 --> 00:02:06,449
What does he do?

28
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:14,424
Do you want some water?
It's hot here, right?

29
00:02:15,391 --> 00:02:17,594
OK, forget it.

30
00:02:23,533 --> 00:02:26,603
Ah, it's seriously funny.

31
00:02:26,803 --> 00:02:31,541
I'm sorry but this is just too funny, right?

32
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:36,813
Superstar Han Dong Min,
mixed up in an absurdity like this?

33
00:02:37,947 --> 00:02:44,988
When we land, you might become
the nation's top celebrity.

34
00:02:59,002 --> 00:03:01,771
How long is this going to last?

35
00:03:01,771 --> 00:03:03,440
Until we get off.

36
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,242
Don't look, you'll get your picture taken.

37
00:03:06,242 --> 00:03:08,745
Looks like your friend was right.

38
00:03:08,745 --> 00:03:09,813
About what?

39
00:03:09,813 --> 00:03:13,416
About you being impulsive.
She warned me about it before.

40
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:16,653
You're not very grateful, are you?

41
00:03:16,653 --> 00:03:18,555
You almost got arrested.
I helped you, but you still...

42
00:03:18,555 --> 00:03:19,722
Thank you!

43
00:03:19,722 --> 00:03:23,893
I'm very grateful, but the way
you helped me was quite daring.

44
00:03:23,893 --> 00:03:27,430
That was all I could think of.
What should I have done instead?

45
00:03:27,564 --> 00:03:30,300
Well, you could have thought
about consequences.

46
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,170
But I'm stupid. I did tell you
that I'm quite stupid, didn't I?

47
00:03:37,807 --> 00:03:42,011
I could have just disappeared,
I'm saying this because I'm worried.

48
00:03:42,011 --> 00:03:43,947
No need to get angry.

49
00:03:46,649 --> 00:03:48,952
After saving you, you're being meddlesome, seriously.

50
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:50,920
What's meddlesome?

51
00:03:52,755 --> 00:03:54,724
It sounds reproachful.

52
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,861
Looks like it wasn't a lie. Even Su Gyeong
had no idea either.

53
00:04:31,861 --> 00:04:35,632
She said she just followed along
to meet an acquaintance.

54
00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:39,736
You are not in the mood to
go back to the company, right?

55
00:04:39,869 --> 00:04:42,572
- Hey, let's go home.
- Yes.

56
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,177
But you should at least
have some dignity, seriously.

57
00:04:47,177 --> 00:04:50,113
Didn't I tell you earlier on
not to make an appearance!

58
00:04:51,581 --> 00:04:53,316
- Stop for a minute.
- What?

59
00:04:56,119 --> 00:04:57,987
They haven't left yet.

60
00:04:58,388 --> 00:04:59,589
Go and talk with her.

61
00:04:59,589 --> 00:05:02,392
Let's just go, I'm going to
meet Su Gyeong later on.

62
00:05:02,392 --> 00:05:04,194
You want to just go
with me shamed like this?

63
00:05:04,194 --> 00:05:06,029
You're really inconsiderate.

64
00:05:06,029 --> 00:05:08,998
We must reconcile, only then will we
be able to put all the pieces together.

65
00:05:08,998 --> 00:05:13,470
Ah, is... Is that so?

66
00:05:15,071 --> 00:05:18,842
Get going and grab hold of that punk. Hurry!

67
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:21,544
It would be better to ride a taxi.

68
00:05:21,544 --> 00:05:23,580
Will it be all right? Things won't
get blown out of proportion, right?

69
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:27,484
After the trouble made by Han Dong Min,
being seen together may not be wise.

70
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,385
Miss Hui Jin!

71
00:05:31,454 --> 00:05:32,322
Come on!

72
00:05:32,322 --> 00:05:34,257
Miss Hui Jin, hold on a
minute! Let's have a talk!

73
00:05:34,257 --> 00:05:34,891
Quick, get in!

74
00:05:34,891 --> 00:05:36,092
It's Han Dong Min.

75
00:05:36,092 --> 00:05:37,393
Where is it? Where?

76
00:05:37,393 --> 00:05:39,195
<i>Where? Really?</i>

77
00:05:39,195 --> 00:05:41,030
It's really Han Dong Min.

78
00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:44,267
<i>It really is.</i>

79
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:46,336
Being chased is probably your fate.

80
00:05:46,336 --> 00:05:49,606
Chased by royal guards over there,
and by lunatics over here.

81
00:05:49,606 --> 00:05:51,674
Is it all right to just leave like this?

82
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,176
What should I do?

83
00:05:53,176 --> 00:05:54,310
I will do as I see fit.

84
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,914
Anyways, it is my life.
You take care of yourself.

85
00:05:58,014 --> 00:05:59,682
Ai, really...

86
00:05:59,682 --> 00:06:03,620
Wait, wait, wait.

87
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,323
Take care, don't die again.

88
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:11,528
Ajussi, please get going.

89
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:18,935
That... No, don't... really.

90
00:06:22,572 --> 00:06:26,009
Ah, I said let's have a talk!

91
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:30,447
Omo, I didn't hear you!
He has already left.

92
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,982
Then can't you ask
him to turn around?

93
00:06:32,982 --> 00:06:35,285
<i>It's Han Dong Min. Wow...</i>

94
00:06:39,322 --> 00:06:42,559
Make him come back,
I didn't get to say goodbye.

95
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:46,362
He probably doesn't want to meet
the person who beat him.

96
00:06:47,464 --> 00:06:49,265
Good point.

97
00:06:51,668 --> 00:06:52,635
<i>Hurry and take it. Quick.</i>

98
00:07:11,488 --> 00:07:14,257
What does this punk do, that he slips
off right away when we meet him?

99
00:07:14,257 --> 00:07:16,493
Does he not have confidence or what?

100
00:07:16,493 --> 00:07:19,596
But come to think of it...
Isn't something funny here?

101
00:07:19,596 --> 00:07:23,233
If he's her lover, why did he
dress up like that in the hospital?

102
00:07:23,233 --> 00:07:25,635
If saying he's not a psycho stalker...

103
00:07:25,635 --> 00:07:29,272
Could he be an actor? An extra,
or something like that?

104
00:07:29,272 --> 00:07:31,574
That's it, that's right!

105
00:07:31,574 --> 00:07:33,076
Our team's extra.

106
00:07:33,076 --> 00:07:36,579
Afraid of being exposed, he escaped.

107
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:42,852
So now, does this mean that I
have been defeated by an extra?

108
00:07:49,359 --> 00:07:51,060
Choe Hui Jin...

109
00:07:52,395 --> 00:07:54,998
Are you deliberately trying to
embarrass me?

110
00:07:54,998 --> 00:07:57,300
You must be shocked, right?
I was shocked as well.

111
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,403
I couldn't even imagine that we
would end up on the same plane.

112
00:08:00,637 --> 00:08:04,874
The "stalker" incident at the hospital
was unfortunate, really.

113
00:08:04,874 --> 00:08:07,210
I didn't expect you to suddenly visit.

114
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:11,014
With the nurses there,
I couldn't say that he was my lover.

115
00:08:11,014 --> 00:08:14,350
In fact, it was me who let
him secretly slip away.

116
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,351
Hey, you--

117
00:08:15,351 --> 00:08:16,853
But how is it possible that
we met on the plane?

118
00:08:16,853 --> 00:08:20,056
It's really interesting. Ha.ha.ha.

119
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,858
are you using me,now?

120
00:08:21,858 --> 00:08:23,526
I even helped you get the role...

121
00:08:23,526 --> 00:08:27,197
I was afraid you would think
that way, which is why I called.

122
00:08:27,197 --> 00:08:30,133
I clearly told you since the
beginning not to treat me that way.

123
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:34,504
I've been emphasizing that all the time. But you
don't seem to get my meaning, do you?

124
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,973
You've changed a lot.

125
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,943
How are you going to handle this relationship?
Shamelessly announcing it in public.

126
00:08:39,943 --> 00:08:41,244
It's because I've learnt it from somebody.

127
00:08:41,244 --> 00:08:44,747
Being with someone arrogant,
I soon became arrogant as well.

128
00:08:44,747 --> 00:08:46,216
See you at the set!

129
00:08:46,216 --> 00:08:47,784
Hey, what does this punk do?

130
00:08:48,218 --> 00:08:50,587
My boyfriend?

131
00:08:51,054 --> 00:08:54,190
He's a scholar, a learned person.

132
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:58,061
Someone who's a very different type
compared to Mr. Han Dong Min. Well then...

133
00:08:58,061 --> 00:09:02,699
Hey, that... Hello? Hello? Hello?

134
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,971
Hahahaha.

135
00:09:09,005 --> 00:09:14,878
Wow, so happy. Showing off
like that, how refreshing.

136
00:09:15,712 --> 00:09:17,847
Is this the time for you
to be happy right now?

137
00:09:17,847 --> 00:09:21,317
A new actress detonating a scandal bomb.

138
00:09:21,317 --> 00:09:26,790
It's all right. Seeing Han Dong Min being played,
it feels like 3 years of grievance has all gone away.

139
00:09:29,058 --> 00:09:32,362
In order to see Han Dong Min
confused, you're exploding, right?

140
00:09:32,362 --> 00:09:35,398
Seriously, who do you think you are?

141
00:09:37,567 --> 00:09:41,304
Not all the people on the plane
would go on the internet, right?

142
00:09:41,304 --> 00:09:43,740
Just some rumors
will be fine right?

143
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,575
Aigoo. Wait and see,

144
00:09:45,575 --> 00:09:47,377
see what's going to happen.

145
00:09:47,377 --> 00:09:50,580
By tomorrow morning, probably even
the crew won't be able to enter.

146
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,682
Because of the disturbance
caused by reporters...

147
00:09:52,682 --> 00:09:54,684
Disturbance?

148
00:09:54,951 --> 00:09:59,088
If you talk about disturbance then?
Aigoo, we'll just think about that then.

149
00:09:59,088 --> 00:10:01,424
Tomorrow, a new sun will rise.

150
00:10:01,424 --> 00:10:03,827
You've got to be kidding.

151
00:10:05,361 --> 00:10:08,731
But, what happened to Gim Bung Do?

152
00:10:08,731 --> 00:10:12,001
Because of him that matters turned
out this way. He just withdraws?

153
00:10:12,001 --> 00:10:15,138
It's really funny, seriously.

154
00:10:15,138 --> 00:10:18,475
That time he called, it wasn't just to
borrow an identity card, was it?

155
00:10:18,475 --> 00:10:19,642
He's a very busy person.

156
00:10:19,642 --> 00:10:21,478
How busy could he be? Saving him...

157
00:10:21,478 --> 00:10:24,080
It's not like it's something
that involves life or death.

158
00:10:24,681 --> 00:10:26,716
It does involve life or death.

159
00:10:26,716 --> 00:10:27,851
<i>Aigoo.
(Aigoo - oh my god)</i>

160
00:10:27,851 --> 00:10:30,887
How can a student have matters
that involve life or death?

161
00:10:31,554 --> 00:10:34,324
Take a look at this.

162
00:10:34,324 --> 00:10:37,360
This is already uploaded on
the internet, what should we do?

163
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,862
Already?

164
00:10:42,966 --> 00:10:45,335
The photos came out well.

165
00:10:45,335 --> 00:10:48,772
Hey, hey, hey!

166
00:10:48,772 --> 00:10:50,774
Starting today, I'm not going
to be your manager anymore!

167
00:10:50,774 --> 00:10:53,576
Go look for another manager!

168
00:10:56,379 --> 00:11:00,583
Look at her, she can't be saved.

169
00:11:00,784 --> 00:11:03,820
How can I transfer this to my phone?

170
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,788
<i>Aigoo.
(Aigoo - oh my god)</i>

171
00:11:04,788 --> 00:11:06,790
Since we don't have a
photo of us together.

172
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:09,392
She must've gone completely crazy.

173
00:11:22,872 --> 00:11:24,374
Who's there?

174
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,977
Lord of Doctrines?

175
00:11:29,345 --> 00:11:30,747
Have you been well?

176
00:11:30,747 --> 00:11:33,616
Weren't you  banished, sir?

177
00:11:33,616 --> 00:11:34,784
I heard that you went to Jeju.

178
00:11:34,784 --> 00:11:38,154
I'm here to see Her Majesty, open the door.

179
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,995
Why are you here?

180
00:11:45,995 --> 00:11:49,032
Did you escape?

181
00:11:49,032 --> 00:11:52,168
There's not much time,
I can't explain carefully.

182
00:11:52,168 --> 00:11:54,370
Something is going to
happen before daylight.

183
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:56,172
What is it?

184
00:11:56,673 --> 00:12:01,111
What has failed previously, will succeed this time.

185
00:12:12,222 --> 00:12:14,357
<i>How did you know to
come at this late hour?</i>

186
00:12:14,357 --> 00:12:16,860
<i>Tonight's incident is directly
related to Lord Min Am.</i>

187
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,463
<i>This is the secret order to assassinate
Your Majesty, handwritten by Min Am.</i>

188
00:12:20,463 --> 00:12:21,731
<i>There's no time to waste</i>

189
00:12:21,731 --> 00:12:24,000
<i>before they make a move.
I must enter the palace </i>

190
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,172
<i>and relay this to His Majesty.</i>

191
00:12:29,172 --> 00:12:32,108
They will make a move today.

192
00:12:32,108 --> 00:12:33,977
They still want to...

193
00:12:33,977 --> 00:12:38,114
Please don't be alarmed no
matter what happens outside.

194
00:12:38,114 --> 00:12:43,086
Also, my coming here is a secret.

195
00:12:44,053 --> 00:12:47,123
I'm alone here, who can I tell?

196
00:12:47,123 --> 00:12:51,127
Even if I say something
no one would believe me.

197
00:12:51,127 --> 00:12:54,230
I hope that you will
not tell His Majesty either.

198
00:12:54,931 --> 00:12:59,135
What can I tell His Majesty
when I can hardly meet him?

199
00:12:59,135 --> 00:13:05,241
You might be able
to see His Majesty tonight.

200
00:13:05,241 --> 00:13:08,011
What does that mean?

201
00:13:10,713 --> 00:13:13,416
Tonight, I want every guard to come
out and vacate all the doors.

202
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:14,651
Pardon?

203
00:13:14,651 --> 00:13:16,186
What are you saying?

204
00:13:16,186 --> 00:13:18,822
Didn't you say that something is going to
happen here and we are to guard this place?

205
00:13:18,822 --> 00:13:20,657
If you want to stay
alive then listen to me.

206
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:24,661
But first, we must hide in the surroundings
in order to protect Her Majesty.

207
00:13:25,328 --> 00:13:29,866
Tonight, someone will definitely come here.

208
00:13:38,942 --> 00:13:41,911
Why do you want to go to the
North Palace at this hour?

209
00:13:41,911 --> 00:13:45,081
Ah, there is someone I need to meet.

210
00:13:45,081 --> 00:13:46,282
At the palace?

211
00:13:46,282 --> 00:13:47,884
During this hour?

212
00:13:51,387 --> 00:13:54,390
By any chance, is that a sword?

213
00:13:55,191 --> 00:13:56,760
It's a wooden sword for practice.

214
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,461
Ah, is that so?

215
00:13:58,461 --> 00:14:00,530
I thought it was...

216
00:14:36,633 --> 00:14:38,501
Your Majesty,

217
00:14:38,802 --> 00:14:41,004
it is already past midnight.

218
00:14:41,004 --> 00:14:43,273
Please go to sleep.

219
00:14:43,273 --> 00:14:45,341
No matter how much
I read it never finishes.

220
00:14:45,341 --> 00:14:48,344
how can there be so much resentment?

221
00:14:48,344 --> 00:14:52,782
There's no empathy and just
a mouth full of disputes.

222
00:14:52,782 --> 00:14:58,822
Your Majesty, you must
take care of your body.

223
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:21,478
Who is it?

224
00:15:23,713 --> 00:15:24,747
Where is it?

225
00:15:24,747 --> 00:15:26,382
Grab him!

226
00:15:28,118 --> 00:15:30,286
What's going on?

227
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,589
Are you all right Your Majesty?

228
00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:35,391
What is that?

229
00:15:37,026 --> 00:15:38,995
It looks like a letter.

230
00:15:38,995 --> 00:15:41,331
Take it down immediately.

231
00:15:44,801 --> 00:15:50,006
<i>Your servant who does not wish to be named
is writing to you to inform you, Your Majesty.</i>

232
00:15:51,841 --> 00:15:56,579
<i>There will be a gathering at
Right Prime Minister's house tonight.</i>

233
00:16:05,321 --> 00:16:10,994
<i>Present there will be Prime Minister Gwon Dae Un,
Left Prime Minister Mun Nae Seon
and Right Prime Minister Min Am.</i>

234
00:16:10,994 --> 00:16:17,667
<i>Your servant has heard them conspiring for
an assassination. Thus I write this letter.</i>

235
00:16:17,667 --> 00:16:19,436
What?

236
00:16:19,469 --> 00:16:22,172
They want to harm the former queen?

237
00:16:34,117 --> 00:16:35,852
Your Excellency,

238
00:16:35,852 --> 00:16:41,191
this lady's Gayageum playing is
much better than Yun Wol isn't it?

239
00:16:41,191 --> 00:16:44,828
I feel good after listening.

240
00:16:46,496 --> 00:16:51,266
Is there still no news
about that presumptous girl?

241
00:16:52,468 --> 00:16:56,039
It was because you were too lenient.

242
00:16:56,072 --> 00:16:59,842
Unknowingly you got betrayed
because of your kindness.

243
00:16:59,842 --> 00:17:05,482
Could've just killed her at
that time to pay the price.

244
00:17:11,487 --> 00:17:15,291
Where are you going, My Lord?
I am about to sing a song.

245
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:19,429
Because of drinking alcohol I forgotten
that I have orders to be given out.

246
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:21,531
Please wait a moment.

247
00:17:55,331 --> 00:18:00,003
Who touched it? I didn't even order...

248
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:12,008
All this while I've left you unharmed.

249
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:15,111
Who, who... Who are you?

250
00:18:21,217 --> 00:18:22,819
How did you get here?

251
00:18:22,819 --> 00:18:24,521
How dare...

252
00:18:24,921 --> 00:18:26,256
Please sit down.

253
00:18:26,256 --> 00:18:29,025
I've prepared the writing ink.

254
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,928
You should be in Jeju, you punk.

255
00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:34,531
Don't tell me...

256
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:37,000
you escaped?

257
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,701
I have no other option and
things just turn out that way.

258
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:41,004
Looks like you have
really lost your mind.

259
00:18:41,004 --> 00:18:44,607
Even if you escaped what's the
use of saving your own life...

260
00:18:46,142 --> 00:18:50,747
Are you saying that you ran
all the way here from Jeju?

261
00:18:50,747 --> 00:18:52,215
That's right.

262
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:54,451
Why? Is it hard to believe?

263
00:18:54,451 --> 00:18:58,488
I only took half a month
just to return here from Jeju.

264
00:18:58,488 --> 00:19:00,690
That is impossible.

265
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:02,725
When was the time you escaped?

266
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:05,762
Didn't I say I came all the way from Jeju?

267
00:19:05,762 --> 00:19:08,665
Fellows mixing poision into
my food awaiting to...

268
00:19:08,665 --> 00:19:11,968
carry out the order to kill.

269
00:19:12,769 --> 00:19:14,571
Please sit down.

270
00:19:19,776 --> 00:19:22,879
Starting now, do not leave
out a single word I say.

271
00:19:22,879 --> 00:19:26,483
This will be an order under
Right Prime Minister Min Am's name.

272
00:19:30,153 --> 00:19:36,192
More than a month ago, due to
Gim Bung Do's meddling, our plan failed.
Tonight, it will finally be carried out.

273
00:19:36,192 --> 00:19:40,396
Your instructions when you get
to the former queen's residence:
Eliminate the former queen.

274
00:19:40,563 --> 00:19:42,132
Why are you startled?

275
00:19:42,132 --> 00:19:47,837
It is of the same content as the
letter that I had snatched from you.

276
00:19:47,837 --> 00:19:51,007
Is it not to remove the head
and to dethrone the queen?

277
00:19:51,007 --> 00:19:52,942
Is it not easy?

278
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:55,912
Just following that and re-writing
it over again will do.

279
00:20:02,152 --> 00:20:05,989
<i>Your servant who does not wish to be named
is writing to you to inform you, Your Majesty.</i>

280
00:20:05,989 --> 00:20:12,695
<i>Because I am unable to watch helplessly
the safety of the royal family at jeopardy.</i>

281
00:20:12,695 --> 00:20:15,865
<i>I only hope to preserve
the safety of the queen.</i>

282
00:20:15,865 --> 00:20:18,935
<i>There's not much time left,
action must be taken at once.</i>

283
00:20:21,237 --> 00:20:22,639
Your Majesty,

284
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:25,074
The criminal still hasn't been captured.

285
00:20:25,074 --> 00:20:28,244
He disappeared just like the wind.

286
00:20:30,246 --> 00:20:32,749
That fellow wrote what kind of letter...

287
00:20:32,749 --> 00:20:39,189
<i>On another note, Your Majesty's official,
Hong Nae Gwan is one of Jang Hui Jae's people.</i>

288
00:20:39,189 --> 00:20:44,427
<i>He will be in fear if he knows
the criminal could not be captured.</i>

289
00:20:44,561 --> 00:20:46,229
Your Majesty?

290
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:50,834
Call the Military Commander
to come and see me.

291
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:53,136
Now, at once!

292
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:06,382
Where exactly is the minister at?

293
00:21:06,382 --> 00:21:08,051
Quick, go look for him.

294
00:21:08,051 --> 00:21:10,353
Yes, My Lord.

295
00:21:13,723 --> 00:21:15,358
Your Excellency!

296
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:18,161
The Lords are looking for you.

297
00:21:18,161 --> 00:21:20,096
Come in.

298
00:21:28,605 --> 00:21:31,508
Why are you here?

299
00:21:31,941 --> 00:21:34,144
Your Excellency?

300
00:21:47,457 --> 00:21:49,859
What is this?

301
00:21:49,859 --> 00:21:53,163
Give this to Ja Su.

302
00:21:53,163 --> 00:21:54,364
Yes.

303
00:22:01,771 --> 00:22:05,975
At once, he should be
at the banquet pavillion.

304
00:22:05,975 --> 00:22:07,710
Yes.

305
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:22,192
His Excellency personally gave it?

306
00:22:22,192 --> 00:22:23,193
Yes.

307
00:22:23,193 --> 00:22:25,962
He said to deliver it at once.

308
00:22:27,697 --> 00:22:30,900
There was no signs yesterday.

309
00:22:31,668 --> 00:22:32,969
I got it.

310
00:22:32,969 --> 00:22:34,437
Yes.

311
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,542
Call the kids here.

312
00:22:40,243 --> 00:22:42,345
There's things to be done.

313
00:22:42,912 --> 00:22:46,116
Now, write another piece
with the same content.

314
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:49,953
This is for Jang Hui Jae to read.

315
00:22:50,487 --> 00:22:56,426
Are you planning to even
frame the queen, how dare you?

316
00:22:56,426 --> 00:22:59,529
It should be you who should be
blamed for framing the queen.

317
00:22:59,529 --> 00:23:01,531
I'm talking about 5 years ago.

318
00:23:04,234 --> 00:23:08,204
<i>The queen, my father...</i>

319
00:23:08,204 --> 00:23:10,373
<i>What is this? My Lady...</i>

320
00:23:10,373 --> 00:23:12,208
My mother...

321
00:23:13,443 --> 00:23:15,011
Father-in-law.

322
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:17,480
Wife.

323
00:23:18,047 --> 00:23:21,184
The one who killed them isn't it you?

324
00:23:28,825 --> 00:23:30,693
Don't you feel wronged at all?

325
00:23:30,693 --> 00:23:35,532
Even if it doesn't happen today, I will
still report the event of your rebellion.

326
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:37,867
How did you know such--

327
00:23:37,867 --> 00:23:41,237
I must have guessed correctly
what is inside your head.

328
00:23:41,237 --> 00:23:42,906
And there's another thing
that I can predict is...

329
00:23:42,906 --> 00:23:45,241
that plan will definitely fail.

330
00:23:45,241 --> 00:23:47,911
So there's no need to bewilder me.

331
00:23:47,911 --> 00:23:51,548
I've only been able to surpass
you earlier by a few days only.

332
00:23:51,548 --> 00:23:56,386
I've told you before,
I'm holding the better card.

333
00:23:59,222 --> 00:24:01,157
Go on, write.

334
00:24:52,509 --> 00:24:54,110
There's no one.

335
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,311
Not even one person?

336
00:24:55,311 --> 00:24:57,614
Even the gateskeeper is not
around, somehow it feels strange.

337
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:01,050
Could it be a trap?

338
00:25:13,897 --> 00:25:16,332
It is a trap! Retreat!

339
00:26:25,301 --> 00:26:26,469
Which one is the head?

340
00:26:26,469 --> 00:26:29,205
Two people have escaped,
seems like it's one of them.

341
00:26:41,751 --> 00:26:43,253
Has everyone been suppressed?

342
00:26:43,253 --> 00:26:44,554
Yes.

343
00:26:55,265 --> 00:26:57,500
What exactly has happened?

344
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,402
What is the Palace Guard doing here?

345
00:27:07,877 --> 00:27:09,412
Your... Your Majesty.

346
00:27:09,913 --> 00:27:11,881
Are you unharmed?

347
00:27:12,315 --> 00:27:16,319
Your Majesty, how could you...

348
00:27:25,195 --> 00:27:31,434
Forgive me. All this while,
how difficult it must have been for you.

349
00:27:33,703 --> 00:27:36,806
I had no idea you would encounter
something like this.

350
00:27:49,853 --> 00:27:51,821
The king came here unexpectedly.

351
00:27:51,821 --> 00:27:54,157
We fell into a trap.

352
00:27:56,259 --> 00:28:01,297
In case there are any mistakes, I will kill everybody involved.
Do you understand?

353
00:28:01,297 --> 00:28:06,102
Yes. But without evidence, we
won't be found out.

354
00:28:06,102 --> 00:28:08,371
Wasn't the order destroyed, too?

355
00:28:13,009 --> 00:28:17,614
All that is left is to keep this safe
and send it to Jang Hui Jae.

356
00:28:19,015 --> 00:28:21,684
It will serve
as definite evidence.

357
00:28:31,094 --> 00:28:34,330
Now, this is all that
needs to be done.

358
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:36,666
You can just wait comfortably
for your fate to come.

359
00:28:45,742 --> 00:28:48,878
Open the door!

360
00:28:48,878 --> 00:28:50,313
What's wrong?

361
00:28:50,313 --> 00:28:52,415
Quickly open the door!
It's a royal order!

362
00:28:52,415 --> 00:28:54,918
Royal order? Yes...

363
00:29:14,237 --> 00:29:15,138
What are you doing?

364
00:29:15,138 --> 00:29:18,541
Search thoroughly. Not even one should
be left out, arrest all at once!

365
00:29:18,541 --> 00:29:19,742
-Yes!
-Yes!

366
00:29:19,909 --> 00:29:22,011
What are you doing?

367
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:27,851
Let go of me!

368
00:29:36,025 --> 00:29:39,429
Right Prime Minister, Min Am.
Please come out to receive the royal order.

369
00:29:40,764 --> 00:29:42,565
Please come out now.

370
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:46,770
What are you doing?

371
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:49,272
Come out immediately to receive the royal order!

372
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,390
The place of your
exile will be at Jeju.

373
00:30:08,491 --> 00:30:10,860
The place where I,

374
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:13,229
had poison in my food.

375
00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:15,665
Moreover, where I did not know not when
a sword would come flying at me.

376
00:30:15,665 --> 00:30:17,801
But if you come, I would welcome you.

377
00:30:19,035 --> 00:30:23,173
Do you think you are able to just
slip away from here cleanly?

378
00:30:23,173 --> 00:30:27,544
You, who have escaped exile, will not be
able to avoid getting beheaded.

379
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:33,249
What are you saying? I have
not left my banishment even once.

380
00:30:34,517 --> 00:30:36,319
What?

381
00:30:37,187 --> 00:30:39,556
I will go and wait for you first.

382
00:30:51,501 --> 00:30:52,368
Arrest him.

383
00:30:52,368 --> 00:30:53,470
Yes, yes.

384
00:30:55,672 --> 00:30:59,476
Right Prime Minister Min Am, you are arrested
for plotting the assasination of the queen.

385
00:30:59,476 --> 00:31:01,211
This is a royal order.

386
00:31:02,879 --> 00:31:06,883
Other than me, there is
another criminal here. Catch him.

387
00:31:06,883 --> 00:31:08,284
What did you say?

388
00:31:08,284 --> 00:31:13,957
The criminal who escaped his banishment,
Gim Bung Do is behind the screens.

389
00:31:26,035 --> 00:31:27,403
There is no one.

390
00:31:29,272 --> 00:31:32,275
That... that... that's impossible.

391
00:31:32,275 --> 00:31:34,477
He was with me all along.

392
00:31:34,477 --> 00:31:36,112
What are you talking about?

393
00:31:36,112 --> 00:31:39,616
That person should now be in Jeju.

394
00:31:39,616 --> 00:31:40,450
Take him away!

395
00:31:40,483 --> 00:31:41,618
- Yes.
- Yes.

396
00:31:44,154 --> 00:31:49,192
Regarding the masterminds behind these
schemes, there is now accurate evidence.

397
00:31:49,192 --> 00:31:51,428
I must certainly punish all of them severely.

398
00:31:51,428 --> 00:31:54,464
Guilty of leading the conspiracy,
Prime Minister, Gwon Dae Un,

399
00:31:54,464 --> 00:31:58,368
Left Prime Minister, Mun Nae Seon,
Right Prime Minister Min Am,

400
00:31:58,368 --> 00:32:00,003
will all be banished to Jeju.

401
00:32:00,003 --> 00:32:04,908
Upon this event, Lady's Jang's younger brother, Jang Hui Jae
and Official Hong Nae Gwan are to be interrogated.

402
00:32:04,908 --> 00:32:08,945
Also the queen who has
suffered threats of disposal,

403
00:32:08,945 --> 00:32:10,680
that cannot be ignored,

404
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,050
is to be immediately reinstated in the
palace and to be strictly guarded.

405
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:18,555
Also, the incident at the office
of Special Advisers earlier on,

406
00:32:18,555 --> 00:32:23,226
Officer Gim Bung Do is to
receive Sin Gu and Bok Gwan.

407
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:55,692
Yun Wol!

408
00:33:26,456 --> 00:33:27,957
Why did you come out here?

409
00:33:27,957 --> 00:33:31,060
Didn't you know I came especially to see you?

410
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,495
Sir?

411
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:35,397
Have you been well?

412
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:50,513
I heard it was the Right Prime Minister who was
behind the crimes.

413
00:33:50,513 --> 00:33:52,048
Is it true, sir?

414
00:33:53,116 --> 00:33:54,818
Seems like it is.

415
00:33:55,285 --> 00:34:00,123
It's hard to believe, sir. How could he
hide his crimes so well?

416
00:34:03,426 --> 00:34:06,296
But... Why did you come here, sir...

417
00:34:07,464 --> 00:34:10,467
Because of the good fortune your talisman gave me.

418
00:34:10,467 --> 00:34:11,301
Sir?

419
00:34:11,301 --> 00:34:14,404
Don't ask more. There's no way
I can explain it in detail.

420
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:18,575
I wanted to tell you the
news so I rushed here.

421
00:34:18,575 --> 00:34:20,877
But you already knew all about it. A pity.

422
00:34:20,877 --> 00:34:22,612
No, sir, it's not like that.

423
00:34:22,612 --> 00:34:27,951
Even Her Majesty the queen's blessing
is not able to presever a life like yours.

424
00:34:27,951 --> 00:34:31,154
When I you free of worry, sir,

425
00:34:31,154 --> 00:34:32,889
it makes me feel happy to be living.

426
00:34:38,261 --> 00:34:40,830
Going through all these
all this time, thank you.

427
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:46,803
My Lord is able to
withstand it, then so will I.

428
00:34:46,803 --> 00:34:50,106
Without you, I could have given up.

429
00:34:53,943 --> 00:34:57,347
The royal order means
I will be returning to Hanyang.

430
00:34:57,347 --> 00:34:59,983
You should also pack your
things and return home.

431
00:34:59,983 --> 00:35:04,154
Does that mean you are going to Jeju, sir?

432
00:35:04,654 --> 00:35:06,656
Before that, there's a place I need to go to.

433
00:35:06,656 --> 00:35:10,226
A place to go, sir? Isn't time pressing?

434
00:35:10,226 --> 00:35:14,564
It wasn't easy returning. What would you
do if you get caught?

435
00:35:14,998 --> 00:35:19,469
There's another benefactor
that I didn't get to thank.

436
00:35:19,469 --> 00:35:21,738
A benefactor, sir?

437
00:35:33,349 --> 00:35:37,554
This seems real, like it isn't acting.

438
00:35:37,554 --> 00:35:39,756
He's probably feeling ashamed
and didn't get enough sleep.

439
00:35:39,756 --> 00:35:41,791
The dark circles are all coming out.

440
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:44,360
I saw the video from the plane on YouTube.

441
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,662
It's really disappointing.

442
00:35:45,662 --> 00:35:45,795
The moment Han Dong Min
makes a fool out of himself,

443
00:35:45,795 --> 00:35:47,330
when Choe Hui Jin admits she was with
her boyfriend...

444
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:50,500
A complete reversal.

445
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,668
Delete this.

446
00:35:51,668 --> 00:35:53,536
You saw it too right?

447
00:35:53,536 --> 00:35:55,738
Watch it, it's totally a scoop.

448
00:35:55,738 --> 00:35:57,674
Han Dong Min is a complete disappointment.

449
00:36:00,777 --> 00:36:02,212
Annyeonghaseyo
[Hello!]

450
00:36:02,879 --> 00:36:04,013
Omo, it's Miss Hui Jin.

451
00:36:04,013 --> 00:36:08,852
Hello! Everyone must be very busy.
Here's some snacks.

452
00:36:08,852 --> 00:36:10,253
Omo, we'll eat it well.

453
00:36:10,653 --> 00:36:13,823
Wait in the lobby.
I'll be there in 5 minutes.

454
00:36:13,823 --> 00:36:16,459
Yes. Good work!

455
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,796
But... he's very good looking.

456
00:36:19,796 --> 00:36:20,463
Eh?

457
00:36:20,463 --> 00:36:22,966
Your boyfriend. He's my type.

458
00:36:25,401 --> 00:36:26,636
Yes.

459
00:37:06,276 --> 00:37:08,178
Don't you have filming today?

460
00:37:08,178 --> 00:37:10,814
There's a scene at night, a palace scene.

461
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:18,488
I'm sorry.

462
00:37:18,488 --> 00:37:21,090
Things have got this noisy.

463
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:23,359
All kinds of scandal is spreading around.

464
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:25,695
And they're saying that the 3 people are
in a love triangle.

465
00:37:25,695 --> 00:37:29,499
Also about your boyfriend getting
hit and being sent to the hospital.

466
00:37:29,499 --> 00:37:31,201
And that you're preparing to sue.

467
00:37:32,402 --> 00:37:34,037
It's absolutely not like that.

468
00:37:34,037 --> 00:37:38,174
He's not injured at all. And what's that about suing...

469
00:37:38,174 --> 00:37:39,676
Suk Jong did get violent.

470
00:37:39,676 --> 00:37:41,578
Queen In Hyeon is two-timing...

471
00:37:41,578 --> 00:37:44,581
What do we do if the image is like this?

472
00:37:44,581 --> 00:37:45,448
With two people like this,

473
00:37:45,448 --> 00:37:47,984
our drama is in danger.

474
00:37:48,585 --> 00:37:50,086
I'm sorry.

475
00:37:50,086 --> 00:37:52,989
I do feel Dong Min went overboard,

476
00:37:52,989 --> 00:37:57,327
but the two of you should come to
an understanding and settle this.

477
00:37:57,327 --> 00:37:59,429
We're all in the same boat, aren't we?

478
00:37:59,429 --> 00:38:02,398
How about settling it tomorrow?

479
00:38:06,136 --> 00:38:08,972
So, according to Dong Min oppa,

480
00:38:08,972 --> 00:38:11,508
you met at the airport the day before.

481
00:38:11,508 --> 00:38:16,946
And, taking a photo of the two guys shaking hands
as a sign of reconcilation would have settled it?

482
00:38:16,946 --> 00:38:19,783
Your friend should have stayed,
why did you send him away?

483
00:38:21,751 --> 00:38:24,687
I told you he had urgent matters.

484
00:38:25,121 --> 00:38:26,723
Well, meeting today will have to  do.

485
00:38:26,723 --> 00:38:28,792
Let's have lunch together. Give him a call.

486
00:38:28,792 --> 00:38:30,760
I already said he's busy.

487
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:34,130
The director did say the first episode
had very high ratings

488
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:37,467
If the ratings fall now, it will be your fault.

489
00:38:38,802 --> 00:38:42,639
What you say is all right, but my friend
has circumstances, you know.

490
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:45,809
I'm just saying to eat together.
What circumstances exactly?

491
00:38:45,809 --> 00:38:47,343
How busy is he?

492
00:38:47,343 --> 00:38:50,113
Even Presidents eat. Who is this guy?

493
00:38:51,047 --> 00:38:52,315
-Give me.
-What?

494
00:38:52,315 --> 00:38:54,417
What's the number of Gim Bung Do's cell phone?

495
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:56,719
If you're embarrassed, I will do it.

496
00:38:57,153 --> 00:38:58,721
Give it to me now.

497
00:38:58,721 --> 00:39:00,356
He doesn't have a cell phone.

498
00:39:00,356 --> 00:39:02,025
He doesn't have a cell phone?

499
00:39:03,893 --> 00:39:07,530
Then, home phone number?

500
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:09,165
There's none.

501
00:39:10,834 --> 00:39:13,269
Then, e-mail?

502
00:39:14,304 --> 00:39:16,272
He doesn't have an e-mail either.

503
00:39:16,973 --> 00:39:19,075
No cell phone and no e-mail.

504
00:39:19,075 --> 00:39:22,078
Then how did you keep in contact until now?

505
00:39:23,513 --> 00:39:25,248
By public phone.

506
00:39:27,617 --> 00:39:30,086
I'm going crazy here.

507
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:36,259
I'll just make a lunch reservation.

508
00:39:36,259 --> 00:39:38,561
You contact him and bring him over.

509
00:39:38,561 --> 00:39:40,396
I told you I can't.

510
00:39:41,197 --> 00:39:43,500
There's no way to contact him.

511
00:39:45,034 --> 00:39:47,904
Are you really dating him or not?

512
00:39:47,904 --> 00:39:49,739
Is this a one-sided love?

513
00:39:51,574 --> 00:39:55,078
Miss Hui Jin, the director wants to
confirm with you about moving lines.

514
00:39:55,078 --> 00:39:55,912
Yes. I'll be right there.

515
00:39:55,912 --> 00:39:57,046
Yes.

516
00:40:00,049 --> 00:40:02,152
Try to think of another solution.

517
00:40:02,152 --> 00:40:04,687
If necessary, I will just do an interview.

518
00:40:10,326 --> 00:40:11,995
This brat.

519
00:40:21,404 --> 00:40:23,072
Does not having a cell phone make any sense?

520
00:40:23,673 --> 00:40:27,510
It's not like he's the President's son.
Why can't he be reached?

521
00:40:33,817 --> 00:40:35,885
I clearly saw his call.

522
00:40:41,991 --> 00:40:43,193
Hello?

523
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,268
Let's go out and have lunch.

524
00:40:52,268 --> 00:40:53,970
Forget it, we'll eat at home.

525
00:40:54,971 --> 00:40:57,273
Come out quickly!

526
00:40:57,273 --> 00:40:58,341
I already said forget it.

527
00:40:58,341 --> 00:41:01,010
At this point in time, is it wise to
go out and attract attention?

528
00:41:01,511 --> 00:41:05,548
We just got a call, you punk.
Hui Jin wants to see you.

529
00:41:09,752 --> 00:41:11,187
Where did she go to?

530
00:41:18,328 --> 00:41:19,662
Miss Hui Jin.

531
00:41:19,662 --> 00:41:20,230
Yes.

532
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:23,032
Su Gyeong asked me to pass this on to you.

533
00:41:23,032 --> 00:41:23,900
What?

534
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:26,102
Why didn't she contact me?

535
00:41:26,102 --> 00:41:28,805
She said that your cell phone was with her.

536
00:41:28,805 --> 00:41:31,908
What? Why did she...

537
00:41:31,908 --> 00:41:35,078
She said you should go to the  CheongDam-dong
restaurant at 1pm. By taxi.

538
00:41:35,078 --> 00:41:37,347
What? CheongDam-dong?

539
00:41:37,347 --> 00:41:38,782
I have to go in for filming now.

540
00:41:38,782 --> 00:41:41,751
Looks like the director has changed
the schedule. The lunch break is 2 hours.

541
00:41:41,751 --> 00:41:44,554
What? Why would the director?

542
00:41:44,554 --> 00:41:47,657
Didn't you make a lunch appointment
with Mr. Dong Min? That is what I heard.

543
00:41:47,657 --> 00:41:49,125
What?

544
00:41:51,361 --> 00:41:53,897
This rotten girl just simply...

545
00:42:05,608 --> 00:42:07,210
Madam, you are with...?

546
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:09,512
Yes, that--

547
00:42:09,512 --> 00:42:10,914
It must be Mr. Han Dong Min, right?

548
00:42:11,681 --> 00:42:12,248
Yes.

549
00:42:12,248 --> 00:42:13,550
This way, please.

550
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:34,971
Where's Su Gyeong?

551
00:42:38,408 --> 00:42:39,676
What are the two of them doing there?

552
00:42:39,676 --> 00:42:42,245
They're preparing to snap a photo.

553
00:42:42,245 --> 00:42:46,216
Han Dong Min reconciling with Choe Hui Jin's boyfriend.

554
00:42:46,216 --> 00:42:49,119
Nothing happened between them.

555
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:53,556
Anyway to improve my image,
you have to cooperate.

556
00:42:53,556 --> 00:42:55,625
You should be thanking me, really.

557
00:42:55,625 --> 00:42:59,229
This is called healing someone after making them sick.

558
00:43:00,663 --> 00:43:03,433
I never imagined it would be this troublesome.

559
00:43:05,702 --> 00:43:08,505
You underestimated my popularity.

560
00:43:10,807 --> 00:43:12,709
What are we supposed to do?

561
00:43:13,309 --> 00:43:15,278
She asked me to do this...

562
00:43:15,278 --> 00:43:16,646
Once that punk comes,

563
00:43:16,646 --> 00:43:20,984
we will greet each other
like brothers, respectfully.

564
00:43:20,984 --> 00:43:24,687
After that I will give my
blessing to the two of you.

565
00:43:24,687 --> 00:43:30,093
That punk will show that he
is fine from head to toe.

566
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:37,934
But, you know, he can't come.

567
00:43:39,536 --> 00:43:42,839
I clearly said that there is
just no way he will come,

568
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:44,774
but it seems Su Gyeong didn't hear it.

569
00:43:45,341 --> 00:43:47,043
I'm sorry.

570
00:43:47,043 --> 00:43:49,712
What are you saying?

571
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:56,019
Have you still not finished taking your revenge on me?

572
00:43:56,486 --> 00:44:00,290
It's not that, he really can't come.

573
00:44:02,258 --> 00:44:03,860
He wants to clear up misunderstandings, too,

574
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:06,096
but his situation just does not
allow coming here.

575
00:44:06,096 --> 00:44:07,797
Try to understand.

576
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:17,740
What, what?

577
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:19,876
What is it about that punk
that he can't make it?

578
00:44:21,611 --> 00:44:23,713
He just isn't coming.

579
00:44:23,713 --> 00:44:25,949
No, no, no. He's coming.

580
00:44:25,949 --> 00:44:27,717
No, he's coming.

581
00:44:27,717 --> 00:44:29,652
Hui Jin said he's not coming, what's going on?

582
00:44:29,652 --> 00:44:30,954
Give it to me.

583
00:44:30,954 --> 00:44:33,123
Oppa, I've already informed
him of the time and place.

584
00:44:33,123 --> 00:44:34,991
He will come.
Just wait a little while.

585
00:44:34,991 --> 00:44:37,093
Really? All right, then.

586
00:44:39,028 --> 00:44:42,832
He's coming. Su Gyeong has informed
him about the time and place.

587
00:44:44,901 --> 00:44:46,569
What do you mean?

588
00:44:49,873 --> 00:44:51,674
Here he is.

589
00:44:59,976 --> 00:45:02,178
Here he is.

590
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:05,982
Didn't you say he is your boyfriend?

591
00:45:05,982 --> 00:45:08,551
You don't even communicate?

592
00:45:09,519 --> 00:45:11,754
I'm sorry I'm late.

593
00:45:16,225 --> 00:45:19,195
It's all right. Thank you for coming.

594
00:45:50,793 --> 00:45:54,163
First of all, let's place our
order before talking.

595
00:46:03,072 --> 00:46:05,174
Just playing along will do?

596
00:46:06,943 --> 00:46:08,444
What is this, really?

597
00:46:08,444 --> 00:46:10,446
I was debating on how to return your favor.

598
00:46:10,446 --> 00:46:13,382
I heard that I could help.
So I came.

599
00:46:16,519 --> 00:46:19,756
Your friend told me to
play the role of a good lover.

600
00:46:21,724 --> 00:46:23,993
I do not really know what to do,

601
00:46:23,993 --> 00:46:25,928
but I will still try my best.

602
00:46:36,973 --> 00:46:39,409
Where did you learn this?

603
00:46:41,511 --> 00:46:44,614
This pure innocence comes out a
hundred times in comic scenes.

604
00:46:44,614 --> 00:46:47,550
Bang, and you appear out of nowhere!

605
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:49,452
It's totally corny.

606
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:53,856
What does "corny" mean?

607
00:46:57,293 --> 00:46:58,861
Are you reproaching me again?

608
00:46:59,262 --> 00:47:00,730
It's a compliment.

609
00:47:04,434 --> 00:47:06,702
If you want to succeed in
the role of my lover,

610
00:47:06,702 --> 00:47:08,771
then just continue with the corny stuff.

611
00:47:09,172 --> 00:47:11,941
I totally like anything corny.

612
00:47:29,474 --> 00:47:33,444
Why this huge sum of money?
You don't even put it in a wallet?

613
00:47:34,145 --> 00:47:35,580
Go outside?

614
00:47:36,281 --> 00:47:37,749
What's this?

615
00:47:37,749 --> 00:47:40,885
This is my feeling of spending
a whole day with Gim Bung Do.

616
00:47:41,419 --> 00:47:44,889
How about poisoning Queen In Hyeon?

617
00:47:44,889 --> 00:47:46,925
I think it would be cool.

618
00:47:46,925 --> 00:47:50,195
If I die, I must certainly
have that fellow die, too.

619
00:47:50,195 --> 00:47:52,764
What's with the talisman?

620
00:47:53,231 --> 00:47:56,568
What should I do that would
be "corny" to Choe Hui Jin?

621
