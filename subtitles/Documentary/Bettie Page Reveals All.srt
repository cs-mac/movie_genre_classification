1
00:00:22,168 --> 00:00:24,437
Ladies and Gentlemen,
here she is now.

2
00:00:24,438 --> 00:00:28,441
Let's get together and
meet that very delightful,

3
00:00:28,442 --> 00:00:31,310
that sultry siren of the southland,

4
00:00:31,311 --> 00:00:34,847
the lovely Bettie Page.

5
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:54,000
Who are you?

6
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:57,003
I'm an illusion.

7
00:00:57,004 --> 00:00:59,138
You're an illusion?

8
00:00:59,139 --> 00:01:01,941
Then you're not real?

9
00:01:01,942 --> 00:01:04,443
Of course, I'm real.

10
00:01:04,444 --> 00:01:06,512
It is very difficult

11
00:01:06,513 --> 00:01:10,650
to find a parallel for her.

12
00:01:10,651 --> 00:01:14,487
I mean, this combination of...

13
00:01:14,488 --> 00:01:16,522
<i>naughty and nice.</i>

14
00:01:16,523 --> 00:01:21,227
<i>And it is all in the
context of innocence.</i>

15
00:01:21,228 --> 00:01:24,096
She expressed sexual liberation.

16
00:01:24,097 --> 00:01:27,333
Bettie is still this subversive,

17
00:01:27,334 --> 00:01:30,536
<i>adventurous, sexual persona</i>

18
00:01:30,537 --> 00:01:32,672
<i>that people are trying to emulate.</i>

19
00:01:32,673 --> 00:01:34,674
I think it's like the confusion

20
00:01:34,675 --> 00:01:37,310
between maybe the real person

21
00:01:37,311 --> 00:01:40,079
and the artwork and the cartoons,

22
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,480
like all of these...

23
00:01:41,481 --> 00:01:44,183
it's sort of confusing even whether
she was a real person or not.

24
00:01:44,184 --> 00:01:47,119
People love Bettie Page
for her whole being

25
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,989
for the radiance that she exuded,

26
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,825
the sexuality that she showed

27
00:01:52,826 --> 00:01:55,962
without being cheap, ever.

28
00:01:55,963 --> 00:01:58,564
And women gravitated
to that concept.

29
00:01:58,565 --> 00:02:01,000
The remarkable thing
about her image is

30
00:02:01,001 --> 00:02:02,902
how much it has
influenced pop culture

31
00:02:02,903 --> 00:02:06,272
from movies to music to
fashion. It's remarkable.

32
00:02:44,244 --> 00:02:48,447
<i>One of the things that I
love about her iconography</i>

33
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:52,351
is that she just portrayed
herself as a very strong woman,

34
00:02:52,352 --> 00:02:55,288
even if she was not in
the position of power.

35
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,595
She's lasted because she
has that rare quality

36
00:03:02,596 --> 00:03:06,397
that's sort of hard to define,
it's that sort of ultimate star quality.

37
00:03:07,534 --> 00:03:10,636
I feel like a lot of girls like me

38
00:03:10,637 --> 00:03:12,338
can identify with Bettie

39
00:03:12,339 --> 00:03:14,307
<i>because you can kind
of capture the spirit</i>

40
00:03:14,308 --> 00:03:18,644
<i>of that sexy, sensual,
timeless look.</i>

41
00:03:19,713 --> 00:03:23,649
She looks fantastic and I
think that's what men prefer.

42
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:30,623
I don't think men prefer the
really skinny, bones thin women.

43
00:03:30,624 --> 00:03:33,659
I think Bettie Page
is a real woman.

44
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,195
I mean she have form, boobs,

45
00:03:36,196 --> 00:03:39,724
butt, and that's very beautiful.

46
00:03:41,868 --> 00:03:45,965
I gave her a lot of credit because
she opened the door for a lot of us.

47
00:03:48,942 --> 00:03:51,677
She's the most
important glamour icon

48
00:03:51,678 --> 00:03:55,104
that she really paved the
way for all the rest.

49
00:03:58,251 --> 00:04:02,154
And she's beautiful but
yet she's approachable,

50
00:04:02,155 --> 00:04:03,723
<i>she's the girl next door.</i>

51
00:04:03,724 --> 00:04:06,525
Bettie Page is the good
girl but she's a bad girl.

52
00:04:06,526 --> 00:04:08,427
<i>She's fun, she's playful.</i>

53
00:04:08,428 --> 00:04:10,557
All right, bitch, bring it.

54
00:04:17,704 --> 00:04:20,106
Oh, st... ah!

55
00:04:20,107 --> 00:04:23,576
I mean, she's the reason
why we're all here today

56
00:04:23,577 --> 00:04:24,944
in a sense is because of her,

57
00:04:24,945 --> 00:04:28,347
I mean, she's the original pinup
girl, she's the original.

58
00:04:28,348 --> 00:04:30,549
We're all going to be dust,

59
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,284
they'll be nothing else anymore,

60
00:04:32,285 --> 00:04:35,254
and there'll always be
Bettie Page no matter what.

61
00:04:35,255 --> 00:04:36,756
She had the magic.

62
00:04:36,757 --> 00:04:38,457
She was deeply religious.

63
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:41,894
She was willing to do all kinds
of crazy outrageous things.

64
00:04:41,895 --> 00:04:44,997
There's some rather large
skeletons in that woman's closet.

65
00:04:44,998 --> 00:04:47,800
How do you reconcile that behavior

66
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:53,105
with the image that she
projects in these photographs?

67
00:04:53,106 --> 00:04:57,009
She reached the peak of popularity
in her profession and disappeared.

68
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:00,436
Nobody knew what
happened to Bettie Page.

69
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:05,504
Bettie, if you know
what's going on,

70
00:07:05,505 --> 00:07:10,643
I want to tell you this is your
friend Robert Schuller saying,

71
00:07:10,644 --> 00:07:15,881
"This too is the day
that God has made.

72
00:07:15,882 --> 00:07:20,486
Let us rejoice and be glad in it."

73
00:07:20,487 --> 00:07:25,124
<i>We all thought we knew her
from different perspectives,</i>

74
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:28,527
but I'm sure no one will
leave this place today

75
00:07:28,528 --> 00:07:30,629
without having had another glimpse

76
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:35,626
into the private heart of Bettie.

77
00:07:38,438 --> 00:07:43,208
<i>Okay, Bettie, I'll just
ask you some questions.</i>

78
00:07:43,209 --> 00:07:44,310
<i>Okay.</i>

79
00:07:44,311 --> 00:07:46,612
<i>You were born in Nashville, right?</i>

80
00:07:46,613 --> 00:07:49,548
<i>I was born in Nashville, Tennessee,</i>

81
00:07:49,549 --> 00:07:53,350
<i>April 22nd, 1923.</i>

82
00:07:54,054 --> 00:07:57,056
<i>We were so poor, we lived on beans,</i>

83
00:07:57,057 --> 00:08:00,025
<i>fried potatoes, and macaroni.</i>

84
00:08:00,026 --> 00:08:03,095
<i>You couldn't talk to Mama,</i>

85
00:08:03,096 --> 00:08:06,699
<i>she didn't want any girls
in the first place.</i>

86
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,126
<i>She always wanted only two boys.</i>

87
00:08:11,504 --> 00:08:14,440
<i>My father was a womanizer
of the worst sort.</i>

88
00:08:14,441 --> 00:08:17,009
<i>A sex fiend is the way to put it.</i>

89
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:21,647
<i>I mean sex with anything that he
could get his "you know what" into.</i>

90
00:08:21,648 --> 00:08:26,485
<i>Chickens, and sheep,
and cows, and anything.</i>

91
00:08:26,486 --> 00:08:29,288
<i>And in order to get 10
cents to go to the movies,</i>

92
00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:31,690
<i>I let him fool around
on the outside.</i>

93
00:08:31,691 --> 00:08:36,221
<i>Now, he didn't penetrate me inside
like he did my two sisters.</i>

94
00:08:38,865 --> 00:08:42,901
<i>Mama left him and hitchhiked
30 miles to Nashville</i>

95
00:08:42,902 --> 00:08:45,004
<i>with six children,</i>

96
00:08:45,005 --> 00:08:47,406
<i>and she was uneducated,
only a third grade education,</i>

97
00:08:47,407 --> 00:08:49,408
<i>she had no trade at all,</i>

98
00:08:49,409 --> 00:08:52,111
<i>and she couldn't take care
of all six of us children,</i>

99
00:08:52,112 --> 00:08:56,243
<i>so my two sisters and I were put in
a Protestant orphanage for a year.</i>

100
00:08:57,984 --> 00:09:02,021
<i>The orphanage was run
by three old maids.</i>

101
00:09:02,022 --> 00:09:06,959
<i>They would talk to us like dogs,
they were very mean to us,</i>

102
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,461
<i>and they had me scrubbing
floors all the time.</i>

103
00:09:09,462 --> 00:09:12,194
<i>I was only 11 years old then.</i>

104
00:09:13,733 --> 00:09:16,368
<i>We just hated that place.</i>

105
00:09:16,369 --> 00:09:19,567
<i>I was so glad to get out of there.</i>

106
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:27,413
<i>I learned to pose from
movie star pictures</i>

107
00:09:27,414 --> 00:09:30,612
<i>in magazines and newspapers.</i>

108
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:37,489
<i>And my sisters and I would
try to mimic their poses.</i>

109
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:41,660
<i>We'd even get out in the front
yard with our underwear on.</i>

110
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:47,666
<i>I had several photographers</i>

111
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:49,501
<i>and amateur photographers</i>

112
00:09:49,502 --> 00:09:51,170
<i>come up and approach me and ask me</i>

113
00:09:51,171 --> 00:09:55,063
<i>if they could take pictures
of me, I always said yes.</i>

114
00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:01,346
<i>My dream when I was in high
school was to be Valedictorian,</i>

115
00:10:01,347 --> 00:10:05,350
<i>and I studied so hard
trying to be Valedictorian</i>

116
00:10:05,351 --> 00:10:11,156
<i>because with it was a four year
scholarship to Vanderbilt University.</i>

117
00:10:11,157 --> 00:10:13,659
<i>But I was beat out of Valedictorian</i>

118
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,395
<i>by one-quarter of a point now,</i>

119
00:10:16,396 --> 00:10:20,365
<i>can you imagine, and I had to
settle for being Salutatorian.</i>

120
00:10:20,366 --> 00:10:23,168
<i>And all I got was a
$100 scholarship</i>

121
00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:26,231
<i>to George Peabody
College for Teachers.</i>

122
00:10:27,907 --> 00:10:31,610
<i>After high school,
I started dating Billy Neal.</i>

123
00:10:31,611 --> 00:10:35,914
<i>He was a big sports
hero around town.</i>

124
00:10:35,915 --> 00:10:37,950
<i>And he taught me to dance,</i>

125
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:41,019
<i>which I've always loved.</i>

126
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:45,424
<i>And he taught me
everything about sex too,</i>

127
00:10:45,425 --> 00:10:48,316
<i>which I enjoyed.</i>

128
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,731
<i>Well, when the war came on,</i>

129
00:10:52,732 --> 00:10:55,334
<i>he was drafted one
day into the army,</i>

130
00:10:55,335 --> 00:10:59,304
<i>and he started bugging
me about marrying him.</i>

131
00:10:59,305 --> 00:11:01,940
<i>We got on the bus and went</i>

132
00:11:01,941 --> 00:11:04,243
<i>30 miles to Galliton, Tennessee,</i>

133
00:11:04,244 --> 00:11:07,545
<i>and were married in five minutes.</i>

134
00:11:08,982 --> 00:11:12,017
<i>And when I got on the bus
to go back with him,</i>

135
00:11:12,018 --> 00:11:15,512
<i>I said to myself,
"What have I done?"</i>

136
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,664
<i>Well, we were in San
Francisco, 1944.</i>

137
00:11:25,665 --> 00:11:28,233
<i>And this fella, he took
a lot of pictures of me</i>

138
00:11:28,234 --> 00:11:31,470
<i>and sent some of them
down to 20th Century Fox.</i>

139
00:11:32,171 --> 00:11:35,974
<i>I had a screen test
with John Russell</i>

140
00:11:35,975 --> 00:11:40,479
<i>who later played the
lawman on a TV series.</i>

141
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,448
<i>But that test was awful.</i>

142
00:11:43,449 --> 00:11:45,984
<i>They tried to make me up</i>

143
00:11:45,985 --> 00:11:48,287
<i>to look like Joan Crawford.</i>

144
00:11:48,288 --> 00:11:51,390
<i>Didn't even look like me.</i>

145
00:11:52,826 --> 00:11:54,526
<i>While I was at the studio,</i>

146
00:11:54,527 --> 00:11:57,396
<i>this big car pulled up beside me...</i>

147
00:11:57,397 --> 00:11:59,865
<i>and a big fat guy,</i>

148
00:11:59,866 --> 00:12:01,834
<i>very ugly looking fella,</i>

149
00:12:01,835 --> 00:12:04,069
<i>wanted me to go to dinner with him.</i>

150
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:06,038
<i>I told him no.</i>

151
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:09,708
<i>And he said, "You'll be sorry."</i>

152
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:12,144
<i>Well, he was at the
head of the table</i>

153
00:12:12,145 --> 00:12:15,047
<i>when I went to learn</i>

154
00:12:15,048 --> 00:12:16,882
<i>the results of the screen test.</i>

155
00:12:16,883 --> 00:12:19,046
<i>That test was awful.</i>

156
00:12:19,786 --> 00:12:22,054
<i>I was so disappointed and unhappy</i>

157
00:12:22,055 --> 00:12:24,857
<i>over the failure of
the screen test,</i>

158
00:12:24,858 --> 00:12:26,458
<i>when I got back to San Francisco,</i>

159
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:28,994
<i>I started eating.</i>

160
00:12:28,995 --> 00:12:33,388
<i>Within two months, I ballooned
way up to 162 pounds.</i>

161
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,668
<i>Well, my sister came to visit me,</i>

162
00:12:36,669 --> 00:12:38,537
<i>Goldie, from Nashville.</i>

163
00:12:38,538 --> 00:12:41,874
<i>She said that the landlord,
he had cussed her out</i>

164
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:44,610
<i>and accused her of causing</i>

165
00:12:44,611 --> 00:12:48,714
<i>the sink in the bathroom
to fall off the wall.</i>

166
00:12:48,715 --> 00:12:51,650
<i>I went to the door, and
boy, he flew in on me,</i>

167
00:12:51,651 --> 00:12:55,454
<i>beating me in the face with
his fist, just a mad man.</i>

168
00:12:55,455 --> 00:12:59,124
<i>And Goldie grabbed the milk bottle and
cracked him over the head with it.</i>

169
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:01,760
<i>And he started bleeding
down the front of his head,</i>

170
00:13:01,761 --> 00:13:05,163
<i>and he thought he was
dying, and we did too.</i>

171
00:13:05,164 --> 00:13:08,033
<i>Because Goldie was underage,</i>

172
00:13:08,034 --> 00:13:11,904
<i>under 21, I'm the one
who had to testify,</i>

173
00:13:11,905 --> 00:13:15,274
<i>even though I'm not the one
who hit him over the head.</i>

174
00:13:15,275 --> 00:13:20,312
<i>But they gave me a 30-day suspended
sentence and I had to pay 10 dollars,</i>

175
00:13:20,313 --> 00:13:24,149
<i>and it was in the paper,
a great big picture of me</i>

176
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:28,020
<i>and a big headline,
"Tenant Bashes Landlord".</i>

177
00:13:33,726 --> 00:13:38,463
<i>Well, Billy came back
from fighting overseas.</i>

178
00:13:38,464 --> 00:13:40,499
<i>He had battle fatigue,
you know, he was in the hospital,</i>

179
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,936
<i>in the army hospital in
Guam for about six months.</i>

180
00:13:43,937 --> 00:13:46,571
<i>When he came home,
he wasn't the same guy.</i>

181
00:13:46,572 --> 00:13:48,807
<i>He was a jealous maniac.</i>

182
00:13:48,808 --> 00:13:52,778
<i>Accused me of sleeping with
every sailor in San Francisco,</i>

183
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:54,813
<i>and he went off the deep end.</i>

184
00:13:54,814 --> 00:13:58,250
<i>So I tried so hard to make a go of
it with him but it was impossible.</i>

185
00:13:58,251 --> 00:14:00,919
<i>We were sitting in the kitchen,</i>

186
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,221
<i>and he had a knife
right at my throat,</i>

187
00:14:03,222 --> 00:14:06,224
<i>he was gonna cut me with
it if I divorced him.</i>

188
00:14:06,225 --> 00:14:09,617
<i>I went ahead and
divorced him anyhow.</i>

189
00:14:13,099 --> 00:14:15,867
<i>When I went to New York,
I was getting over</i>

190
00:14:15,868 --> 00:14:20,500
<i>my divorce from Billy Neal
and the miserable marriage.</i>

191
00:14:21,274 --> 00:14:25,043
<i>I liked all the lights on Broadway.</i>

192
00:14:25,044 --> 00:14:27,946
<i>And I liked Central Park.</i>

193
00:14:27,947 --> 00:14:33,585
<i>All I paid for my apartment
on West 46th Street,</i>

194
00:14:33,586 --> 00:14:38,924
<i>46 dollars and 29 cents a month.</i>

195
00:14:38,925 --> 00:14:41,994
<i>I used to go to the
Roseland ballroom.</i>

196
00:14:41,995 --> 00:14:45,330
<i>And then I went dancing so much.</i>

197
00:14:45,331 --> 00:14:48,433
<i>I was a movie fiend in those days.</i>

198
00:14:48,434 --> 00:14:51,103
<i>Didn't cost much of
anything, 40 or 50 cents,</i>

199
00:14:51,104 --> 00:14:53,904
<i>something like that,
to see a double feature.</i>

200
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:58,777
<i>One night, I was very lonely,</i>

201
00:14:58,778 --> 00:15:03,749
<i>and I was walking along Broadway,
and a good looking fella came up</i>

202
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,951
<i>and started talking to
me, introduced himself.</i>

203
00:15:05,952 --> 00:15:09,788
<i>He was very polite and courteous,
seemed like a very nice fella.</i>

204
00:15:09,789 --> 00:15:12,357
<i>He asked me, "Would
like to go dancing?"</i>

205
00:15:12,358 --> 00:15:14,860
<i>I said, "Sure, I'd love to go."</i>

206
00:15:14,861 --> 00:15:16,561
<i>So we got in the car,</i>

207
00:15:16,562 --> 00:15:18,030
<i>and he and I sat in the back,</i>

208
00:15:18,031 --> 00:15:21,199
<i>and the girlfriend and
the boyfriend driving.</i>

209
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,203
<i>Well, we stopped at a red light,
and two guys jumped in the car.</i>

210
00:15:25,204 --> 00:15:26,905
<i>We went farther on,</i>

211
00:15:26,906 --> 00:15:29,708
<i>two more fellas got in the car.</i>

212
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:33,412
<i>But when it hit me, a big
pain shot through me</i>

213
00:15:33,413 --> 00:15:35,280
<i>as we crossed that
bridge and I thought,</i>

214
00:15:35,281 --> 00:15:37,979
<i>"We are not going dancing."</i>

215
00:15:39,552 --> 00:15:42,921
<i>You can imagine how you
would have felt then</i>

216
00:15:42,922 --> 00:15:47,258
<i>with six men in the car
and the two women.</i>

217
00:15:49,262 --> 00:15:51,229
<i>The guy in front and his girlfriend</i>

218
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,598
<i>got out of the car and
went behind the building.</i>

219
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:57,135
<i>I thought real fast, and
I said I'm menstruating,</i>

220
00:15:57,136 --> 00:15:59,638
<i>you can't have sex with me.</i>

221
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:02,974
<i>And all five of those
snakes forced me</i>

222
00:16:02,975 --> 00:16:07,072
<i>to perform oral sex
on every one of them.</i>

223
00:16:09,415 --> 00:16:14,411
<i>They could have killed me or something
and left me dead behind that school.</i>

224
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:21,851
<i>I went home to Mama right
away, I was so frightened.</i>

225
00:16:27,967 --> 00:16:31,770
<i>Back in New York, the first
secretarial job I ever had</i>

226
00:16:31,771 --> 00:16:35,674
<i>in New York was for the
American Bread Company.</i>

227
00:16:35,675 --> 00:16:39,067
<i>I was a secretary to
the office manager.</i>

228
00:16:43,116 --> 00:16:44,316
<i>I had a small room up on the fifth
floor of an old brownstone house.</i>

229
00:16:45,685 --> 00:16:49,421
<i>Somebody knocked on the
door around midnight.</i>

230
00:16:49,422 --> 00:16:50,989
Who is it?

231
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:53,024
<i>And he said, "Bettie, open
the door, it's Billy."</i>

232
00:16:53,025 --> 00:16:55,360
- What do you want?
- <i>"Let me in."</i>

233
00:16:55,361 --> 00:16:59,231
<i>A friend of mine in the next
apartment, a little fella named Jimmy,</i>

234
00:16:59,232 --> 00:17:01,967
<i>a 50-year-old man,
came out to the door</i>

235
00:17:01,968 --> 00:17:04,503
<i>and asked what was going on.</i>

236
00:17:04,504 --> 00:17:06,238
<i>Well, Billy told him to
mind his own business,</i>

237
00:17:06,239 --> 00:17:09,708
<i>and he cut little Jimmy
across the face,</i>

238
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:12,244
<i>a couple of inches
with a knife now.</i>

239
00:17:12,245 --> 00:17:15,705
<i>He was going to kill me with a
knife is what he was going to do.</i>

240
00:17:16,649 --> 00:17:18,350
<i>He must have left.</i>

241
00:17:18,351 --> 00:17:21,015
<i>He didn't come back.</i>

242
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:27,192
<i>I was working as
secretary, way up high</i>

243
00:17:27,193 --> 00:17:29,761
<i>in the Eastern Airlines
building on the 12th floor,</i>

244
00:17:29,762 --> 00:17:33,365
<i>overlooking the skating
rink in Rockefeller Center,</i>

245
00:17:33,366 --> 00:17:35,400
<i>a very nice place to work.</i>

246
00:17:35,401 --> 00:17:39,271
<i>And that's where I met the love
of my life, Carlos Garcia Arrese.</i>

247
00:17:40,473 --> 00:17:43,008
<i>You know I was a nut over
dancing back in those days.</i>

248
00:17:43,009 --> 00:17:47,612
<i>And he taught me the rumba, and
mambo, and cha-cha, and samba.</i>

249
00:17:47,613 --> 00:17:50,415
<i>And he was very good at it.</i>

250
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:54,186
<i>Well, we dated and we
were making mad love,</i>

251
00:17:54,187 --> 00:17:56,487
<i>he was a very good lover.</i>

252
00:17:57,557 --> 00:18:00,258
<i>One night I was up
at his apartment,</i>

253
00:18:00,259 --> 00:18:04,062
<i>all of a sudden, a big
loud knocking on the door,</i>

254
00:18:04,063 --> 00:18:06,064
<i>"Carlos, open up the door,
I know you're in there."</i>

255
00:18:06,065 --> 00:18:10,669
<i>And she was really mad, and I
thought, oh gosh, who's that?</i>

256
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:12,704
<i>And he said, "Bettie,
that's my wife."</i>

257
00:18:12,705 --> 00:18:15,073
<i>I said, "Your wife!"</i>

258
00:18:15,074 --> 00:18:19,110
<i>I never felt so low in my
life, I felt like two cents.</i>

259
00:18:19,111 --> 00:18:23,148
<i>I didn't want to see him again
because he had deceived me.</i>

260
00:18:23,149 --> 00:18:28,077
<i>But if I had known he was married
I would never have dated him.</i>

261
00:18:33,192 --> 00:18:36,161
<i>I always wanted to
be a fashion model.</i>

262
00:18:36,162 --> 00:18:40,532
<i>And I went to... let's see, what was
the name of the most famous one?</i>

263
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:43,101
<i>Ford, that's it.
She says, "Oh, my."</i>

264
00:18:43,102 --> 00:18:45,770
<i>She says, "You would never
do as a fashion model."</i>

265
00:18:45,771 --> 00:18:48,173
<i>She says, "In the first place,
you're not tall enough."</i>

266
00:18:48,174 --> 00:18:50,775
<i>But she says, "More than that,"
she says, "you're too hippy."</i>

267
00:18:50,776 --> 00:18:53,111
<i>You've got to be skin
and bones, you know.</i>

268
00:18:53,112 --> 00:18:55,946
<i>Even back then, to
be a fashion model.</i>

269
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:04,889
<i>In October 1950, I was
walking out on Coney Island.</i>

270
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:07,459
<i>Nobody was on the
beach in that area,</i>

271
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,794
<i>except this black
fella, Jerry Tibbs.</i>

272
00:19:09,795 --> 00:19:13,999
<i>He gave me his card and he said,
"I'm a Brooklyn policeman."</i>

273
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,435
<i>He said, "I think you'd
make a good pinup model."</i>

274
00:19:17,436 --> 00:19:20,605
<i>He said, "I have a studio,
if you would come over there</i>

275
00:19:20,606 --> 00:19:22,674
<i>free of charge, I'll
make you up a portfolio</i>

276
00:19:22,675 --> 00:19:25,744
<i>that you could take
around to the studios."</i>

277
00:19:25,745 --> 00:19:28,880
<i>I posed in a couple
of bikinis of his.</i>

278
00:19:28,881 --> 00:19:31,816
<i>But he said, "Bettie, have you
ever tried to wear bangs?"</i>

279
00:19:31,817 --> 00:19:35,553
<i>He said, "You have a very high forehead,
I think you'd look good in bangs."</i>

280
00:19:35,554 --> 00:19:38,223
<i>So I went home and cut me some.</i>

281
00:19:38,224 --> 00:19:43,495
<i>And I've been wearing them ever since,
its sort of been a trademark of mine,</i>

282
00:19:43,496 --> 00:19:45,964
<i>I'm still wearing them.</i>

283
00:19:45,965 --> 00:19:48,466
<i>That's that famous
Bettie Page look, isn't it?</i>

284
00:19:52,271 --> 00:19:54,105
<i>I think I was about 27</i>

285
00:19:54,106 --> 00:19:55,807
<i>when I started modeling,</i>

286
00:19:55,808 --> 00:19:57,609
<i>but I looked much younger.</i>

287
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:00,412
<i>All of the writers and editors</i>

288
00:20:00,413 --> 00:20:03,114
<i>would say I was 22 years old,</i>

289
00:20:03,115 --> 00:20:05,784
<i>they were saying that for
years that I was 22.</i>

290
00:20:05,785 --> 00:20:09,354
<i>I never refuted it, I never said
anything one way or another,</i>

291
00:20:09,355 --> 00:20:11,389
<i>let them think what they wanted to.</i>

292
00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:17,729
<i>The first modeling I did
was for the camera clubs.</i>

293
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:21,691
<i>First one was Cass Carr who
was an orchestra leader.</i>

294
00:20:23,402 --> 00:20:25,136
Every Sunday we'd
say we're going out

295
00:20:25,137 --> 00:20:27,939
to Headly Farm in New
Jersey or some other farm,

296
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:31,476
or we're going out to Fire
Island or Broad Channel Bay.

297
00:20:31,477 --> 00:20:35,080
Bettie Page and four other amateur
models will be with them,

298
00:20:35,081 --> 00:20:37,916
<i>and it would cost ten
dollars or five dollars.</i>

299
00:20:37,917 --> 00:20:41,419
<i>There would be maybe 30
or 40 camera club members</i>

300
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,055
<i>and three or four models.</i>

301
00:20:44,056 --> 00:20:46,591
<i>We would go on field
trips, on weekends,</i>

302
00:20:46,592 --> 00:20:48,793
<i>upstate New York,
over in New Jersey,</i>

303
00:20:48,794 --> 00:20:51,719
<i>on the beaches,
especially on Fire Island.</i>

304
00:20:53,065 --> 00:20:55,933
<i>I got 25 dollars a day.</i>

305
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:01,940
<i>And we would be gone all afternoon
and they would bring lunches,</i>

306
00:21:01,941 --> 00:21:05,377
<i>and I enjoyed the
outings very much.</i>

307
00:21:05,378 --> 00:21:09,614
<i>They were always polite
and courteous to us.</i>

308
00:21:09,615 --> 00:21:11,516
<i>I enjoyed posing for them.</i>

309
00:21:11,517 --> 00:21:14,786
It was absolutely fun
photographing Bettie.

310
00:21:14,787 --> 00:21:18,690
<i>And I could tell, I think it
shows up in the photographs,</i>

311
00:21:18,691 --> 00:21:20,625
<i>that she enjoyed it too.</i>

312
00:21:20,626 --> 00:21:22,093
<i>She was happy.</i>

313
00:21:22,094 --> 00:21:24,996
<i>She was exhilarated.</i>

314
00:21:24,997 --> 00:21:26,331
<i>She projected.</i>

315
00:21:26,332 --> 00:21:28,400
<i>She came right out at you.</i>

316
00:21:28,401 --> 00:21:30,935
<i>Whereas others were just pretty.</i>

317
00:21:30,936 --> 00:21:34,272
When she turned, she didn't
just turn and smile,

318
00:21:34,273 --> 00:21:36,174
<i>her hands, her body, her feet,</i>

319
00:21:36,175 --> 00:21:38,343
<i>everything moved, everything moved.</i>

320
00:21:38,344 --> 00:21:41,613
<i>She smiled with her face, she
smiled with her whole body.</i>

321
00:21:41,614 --> 00:21:44,039
<i>And that's something
very few girls got.</i>

322
00:21:45,284 --> 00:21:48,386
<i>The good pinup
involves three things:</i>

323
00:21:48,387 --> 00:21:52,290
<i>Pose, clothes, and expression.</i>

324
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:55,193
She knew just when I
said, pert, saucy,

325
00:21:55,194 --> 00:21:58,396
frisky, haughty, angry, sullen,

326
00:21:58,397 --> 00:22:01,299
whereas with many other
models I'd have to tell them,

327
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,268
"Well, no, tilt your
head up a little bit,"

328
00:22:03,269 --> 00:22:06,371
"Move it up like that,"
"Raise your eyes," etcetera.

329
00:22:06,372 --> 00:22:08,673
<i>She would pop up into
that right away.</i>

330
00:22:08,674 --> 00:22:11,810
<i>I was very happy posing.</i>

331
00:22:11,811 --> 00:22:13,578
<i>And I never had any problem</i>

332
00:22:13,579 --> 00:22:16,047
<i>thinking of what to
do with my body.</i>

333
00:22:16,048 --> 00:22:20,985
<i>I could think of a thousand different
poses that just came natural to me.</i>

334
00:22:20,986 --> 00:22:23,588
<i>Sometimes I would imagine</i>

335
00:22:23,589 --> 00:22:26,558
<i>the camera was my boyfriend.</i>

336
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,195
<i>And I would play to my boyfriend.</i>

337
00:22:30,196 --> 00:22:34,566
<i>All I do know is that when
Bettie Page was announced</i>

338
00:22:34,567 --> 00:22:37,469
<i>as being the feature model</i>

339
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:40,171
<i>of next Sunday's shoot,</i>

340
00:22:40,172 --> 00:22:43,063
<i>there was a big crowd.</i>

341
00:22:45,678 --> 00:22:47,612
<i>Did the guys in the camera clubs</i>

342
00:22:47,613 --> 00:22:50,014
<i>ask you out for dates a lot?</i>

343
00:22:50,015 --> 00:22:51,182
<i>No.</i>

344
00:22:51,183 --> 00:22:53,852
<i>Now I wouldn't date anybody
who drank or smoke.</i>

345
00:22:53,853 --> 00:22:58,756
<i>I just don't like the taste
of cigarettes on your breath,</i>

346
00:22:58,757 --> 00:23:01,625
<i>and I hate alcohol.</i>

347
00:23:02,361 --> 00:23:05,730
One of the most interesting
characters in this entire story

348
00:23:05,731 --> 00:23:07,799
was Richard Arbib,

349
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,201
<i>one of her ex-boyfriends.</i>

350
00:23:10,202 --> 00:23:15,273
<i>He was a top designer of the '50s.</i>

351
00:23:15,274 --> 00:23:20,543
<i>Designed cars, watches,
extremely well known designer.</i>

352
00:23:24,717 --> 00:23:28,953
<i>Richard had split up with his wife,</i>

353
00:23:28,954 --> 00:23:30,455
<i>and met Bettie,</i>

354
00:23:30,456 --> 00:23:32,790
<i>and they had a red hot romance,</i>

355
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:35,460
<i>they were deeply in love.</i>

356
00:23:35,461 --> 00:23:39,964
<i>He took her in his two
seater down to Florida.</i>

357
00:23:39,965 --> 00:23:42,600
<i>Well, we just decided we'd take off</i>

358
00:23:42,601 --> 00:23:45,870
<i>and go to Florida for three weeks.</i>

359
00:23:45,871 --> 00:23:49,541
<i>She wanted to have sex with
me in the car and I said,</i>

360
00:23:49,542 --> 00:23:52,577
<i>"If you're going to do that, I've got
to stop 'cause I'll go off the road."</i>

361
00:23:52,578 --> 00:23:55,446
<i>So she's going away at me,</i>

362
00:23:55,447 --> 00:23:58,783
<i>and all of a sudden there's
a flashlight in the door,</i>

363
00:23:58,784 --> 00:24:02,253
<i>it was raining cats and dogs,
there's a state trooper there.</i>

364
00:24:02,254 --> 00:24:05,919
<i>And I thought he was going to arrest
us for having sex in the car.</i>

365
00:24:07,192 --> 00:24:11,696
<i>All he said was, "You all know
you've got one tail light out."</i>

366
00:24:11,697 --> 00:24:15,667
<i>Bettie had a very normal sex life.</i>

367
00:24:15,668 --> 00:24:19,637
<i>She wasn't inhibited, she wasn't
hung up in any way at all.</i>

368
00:24:19,638 --> 00:24:23,007
<i>She liked sex and she
was very good at it.</i>

369
00:24:23,008 --> 00:24:26,511
<i>Arbib told me he designed
a watch for Bettie.</i>

370
00:24:26,512 --> 00:24:29,480
<i>It was a custom made
piece for Bettie Page.</i>

371
00:24:29,481 --> 00:24:32,782
<i>He was renowned for his watches.</i>

372
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,955
<i>This was a unique one
of a kind piece.</i>

373
00:24:36,956 --> 00:24:42,527
<i>He presented it to her
and she wore it proudly.</i>

374
00:24:42,528 --> 00:24:46,364
<i>And for some reason,
Richard decided that</i>

375
00:24:46,365 --> 00:24:48,232
<i>he was going to give it one
more shot with his wife,</i>

376
00:24:48,233 --> 00:24:50,802
<i>and it didn't work
out with his wife,</i>

377
00:24:50,803 --> 00:24:52,937
<i>and when he came back,
Bettie was gone.</i>

378
00:24:52,938 --> 00:24:57,240
<i>And that was the
regret of his life.</i>

379
00:24:58,444 --> 00:25:02,480
All of the guys that I
knew that met this woman,

380
00:25:02,481 --> 00:25:08,217
had this, "The one that got
away" ennui about them.

381
00:25:09,321 --> 00:25:14,325
She wasn't just a pretty face with
nothing behind it, she was not a facade.

382
00:25:14,326 --> 00:25:16,327
She had a high IQ.

383
00:25:16,328 --> 00:25:21,131
<i>And had a great range of
things that interested her.</i>

384
00:25:23,569 --> 00:25:25,136
<i>I used to make a lot of my clothes.</i>

385
00:25:25,137 --> 00:25:28,773
<i>I made all my bikinis,
most of my lingerie.</i>

386
00:25:28,774 --> 00:25:31,142
<i>I enjoyed making them.</i>

387
00:25:33,145 --> 00:25:36,547
Bettie used to design stuff.

388
00:25:36,548 --> 00:25:38,583
<i>She could have made a fortune.</i>

389
00:25:38,584 --> 00:25:42,453
<i>'Cause she had an eye for
it, she knew what was sexy.</i>

390
00:25:42,454 --> 00:25:46,758
<i>Bikinis were never heard of on
the beaches in this country.</i>

391
00:25:48,794 --> 00:25:50,895
<i>Don't know what the
wild waves are saying,</i>

392
00:25:50,896 --> 00:25:54,032
<i>but the gals are talking about the
latest thing in swimming attire.</i>

393
00:25:54,033 --> 00:25:57,135
<i>A suit with a built in girdle.</i>

394
00:25:57,136 --> 00:25:59,537
<i>I made them real skimpy.</i>

395
00:25:59,538 --> 00:26:02,270
<i>It was considered very risqué.</i>

396
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:07,111
<i>One of the jobs I had in New York</i>

397
00:26:07,112 --> 00:26:09,814
<i>was with a couple down
in Greenwich Village.</i>

398
00:26:09,815 --> 00:26:13,751
<i>Well, they had me bring
every one of my costumes,</i>

399
00:26:13,752 --> 00:26:15,887
<i>especially all my bikinis.</i>

400
00:26:15,888 --> 00:26:20,486
<i>And I wondered why they had me
change costumes so many times.</i>

401
00:26:22,294 --> 00:26:25,296
<i>And then they had taken my designs</i>

402
00:26:25,297 --> 00:26:27,331
<i>from the pictures they'd took of me</i>

403
00:26:27,332 --> 00:26:29,967
<i>and had them manufactured
under my name</i>

404
00:26:29,968 --> 00:26:34,236
<i>and selling them as "Bettie
Page's Bikinis" now.</i>

405
00:26:35,841 --> 00:26:41,144
<i>I should have sued them or something,
but I didn't do anything about it.</i>

406
00:26:51,423 --> 00:26:55,493
<i>The first bona fide
commercial work I did</i>

407
00:26:55,494 --> 00:26:59,363
<i>was for Robert
Harrison's magazines.</i>

408
00:26:59,364 --> 00:27:01,599
<i>You know, he had five
or six girly books.</i>

409
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,871
<i>Wink, Titter, Flirt, Beauty Parade.</i>

410
00:27:06,872 --> 00:27:09,307
<i>They had four or five
writers in the back room</i>

411
00:27:09,308 --> 00:27:13,211
<i>that made up all kinds of crazy
things we had to act out.</i>

412
00:27:13,212 --> 00:27:16,948
<i>But one thing I didn't like and
none of the other girls did either,</i>

413
00:27:16,949 --> 00:27:22,019
<i>Robert Harrison insisted
that our breasts be taped.</i>

414
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,689
<i>He was a nut about the cleavage.</i>

415
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:27,191
<i>I'd have to hold my
breasts together,</i>

416
00:27:27,192 --> 00:27:30,828
<i>and they put a great big
thick two-inches wide tape,</i>

417
00:27:30,829 --> 00:27:32,830
<i>all the way across.</i>

418
00:27:32,831 --> 00:27:34,732
<i>I hated that.</i>

419
00:27:34,733 --> 00:27:37,769
<i>Mr. Harrison said, "Bettie,
I want you to represent</i>

420
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:40,171
<i>my magazines at the artists ball."</i>

421
00:27:40,172 --> 00:27:43,741
<i>They have a contest
for the best costume.</i>

422
00:27:43,742 --> 00:27:46,511
<i>And guess what I was wearing?</i>

423
00:27:46,512 --> 00:27:51,082
<i>Just two telephone dials, one
over this breast, one over this,</i>

424
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:53,284
<i>and a suggestion box,</i>

425
00:27:53,285 --> 00:27:55,419
<i>and black net stockings
up to the waist,</i>

426
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:59,390
<i>and that was it, and
I won it that year,</i>

427
00:27:59,391 --> 00:28:02,126
<i>and I got a whole set
of Revere kitchen ware.</i>

428
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:12,403
<i>Estes Kefauver of the Senate
crime investigation fame</i>

429
00:28:12,404 --> 00:28:14,572
<i>brings the Democratic
political pot to boil</i>

430
00:28:14,573 --> 00:28:18,101
<i>by announcing his candidacy for
the presidential nomination.</i>

431
00:28:19,011 --> 00:28:21,579
<i>Senator Estes Kefauver.</i>

432
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,381
<i>He's from my home state, you know.</i>

433
00:28:23,382 --> 00:28:26,617
<i>He was trying to drum up votes,</i>

434
00:28:26,618 --> 00:28:28,653
<i>and get the public on his side,</i>

435
00:28:28,654 --> 00:28:33,391
<i>by going after juvenile
delinquency and pornography.</i>

436
00:28:33,392 --> 00:28:37,461
What I expected, having
served in World War II,

437
00:28:37,462 --> 00:28:41,199
which I thought was a fight
for democracy and liberation,

438
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,301
<i>what I expected after
World War II was</i>

439
00:28:43,302 --> 00:28:46,804
something like what I perceived
as the "Roaring '20s" was like

440
00:28:46,805 --> 00:28:49,605
after World War I,
a huge celebration.

441
00:28:50,976 --> 00:28:54,311
<i>And what we actually
got was repression.</i>

442
00:28:56,081 --> 00:28:58,950
Repression on several fronts,

443
00:28:58,951 --> 00:29:01,586
it was social and
sexual and political.

444
00:29:01,587 --> 00:29:04,989
<i>Are you now or have you ever been
a member of the Communist Party?</i>

445
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:07,625
The thing that the
American people can do

446
00:29:07,626 --> 00:29:12,196
is to be vigilant, day and night.

447
00:29:12,197 --> 00:29:15,733
To make sure they
don't have communists

448
00:29:15,734 --> 00:29:20,037
teaching the sons and
daughters of America.

449
00:29:20,038 --> 00:29:23,274
We have an image of the fifties as
a time when everything was placid

450
00:29:23,275 --> 00:29:26,744
and everybody lived in a sort
of Ozzie and Harriet life,

451
00:29:26,745 --> 00:29:29,947
<i>but going on at the same
time in the culture</i>

452
00:29:29,948 --> 00:29:32,617
was an enormous amount of fear

453
00:29:32,618 --> 00:29:35,386
of infiltration of new things

454
00:29:35,387 --> 00:29:38,089
<i>that were going to undermine
and infect the culture,</i>

455
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:41,492
<i>and make the youth of
America delinquents,</i>

456
00:29:41,493 --> 00:29:43,327
<i>as the term that had been invented.</i>

457
00:29:43,328 --> 00:29:45,796
And a lot of it focused
on pornography.

458
00:29:45,797 --> 00:29:48,199
<i>The peddling of obscene books,</i>

459
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,568
<i>a furtive and despicable occupation</i>

460
00:29:50,569 --> 00:29:52,470
<i>has become a lucrative sideline</i>

461
00:29:52,471 --> 00:29:55,373
<i>for unscrupulous shopkeepers in
some high school neighborhoods.</i>

462
00:29:55,374 --> 00:29:58,009
<i>People basically,
I think, felt that anything</i>

463
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:00,011
<i>that got people sexually
excited was a bad thing.</i>

464
00:30:00,012 --> 00:30:03,711
<i>I mean, even to talk about sex
in the 1950s was a taboo.</i>

465
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:08,352
The Postmaster General had
a very visible campaign

466
00:30:08,353 --> 00:30:11,689
of trying to suppress
the use of the mails

467
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:14,091
to deliver sexually
explicit materials.

468
00:30:14,092 --> 00:30:16,427
<i>Postal inspectors
could open your mail,</i>

469
00:30:16,428 --> 00:30:17,728
<i>they could confiscate it,</i>

470
00:30:17,729 --> 00:30:20,031
<i>they could come and do
raids on your premises</i>

471
00:30:20,032 --> 00:30:21,899
<i>to keep you from mailing
material at another time.</i>

472
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,001
<i>Of course they could turn you
over to the prosecution.</i>

473
00:30:24,002 --> 00:30:29,373
So they had a great deal of
power at their disposal.

474
00:30:29,374 --> 00:30:33,611
Anything that would be
perceived as being lewd,

475
00:30:33,612 --> 00:30:36,047
a term pretty broad,

476
00:30:36,048 --> 00:30:38,482
could be treated as a crime

477
00:30:38,483 --> 00:30:40,318
if you circulated it
through the mail.

478
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:43,821
And certainly nudity alone was
considered enough to be obscene

479
00:30:43,822 --> 00:30:46,918
by the standards of the
authorities at the time.

480
00:30:47,859 --> 00:30:51,629
<i>I don't even believe God
disapproves of nudity,</i>

481
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:54,398
<i>after all, he put Adam and Eve</i>

482
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:58,166
<i>in the Garden of Eden
naked as jaybirds.</i>

483
00:31:00,105 --> 00:31:02,807
<i>As a part of posing
for the camera club,</i>

484
00:31:02,808 --> 00:31:05,076
<i>most of it was in bikinis,</i>

485
00:31:05,077 --> 00:31:06,911
<i>but sometimes there would be</i>

486
00:31:06,912 --> 00:31:09,212
<i>a few shots topless.</i>

487
00:31:23,829 --> 00:31:26,464
<i>Bettie Page was very sexual,</i>

488
00:31:26,465 --> 00:31:29,356
<i>but in a very free and
innocent kind of way.</i>

489
00:31:30,435 --> 00:31:31,969
<i>She's gorgeous</i>

490
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:35,940
<i>and she makes you feel good.</i>

491
00:31:35,941 --> 00:31:39,043
<i>She makes direct eye
contact with you,</i>

492
00:31:39,044 --> 00:31:42,413
<i>and it's engaging.</i>

493
00:31:42,414 --> 00:31:44,148
I've seen her work

494
00:31:44,149 --> 00:31:47,651
with some very shy newcomers,

495
00:31:47,652 --> 00:31:50,087
<i>and actually help them out.</i>

496
00:31:50,088 --> 00:31:53,391
<i>Bettie would suggest something,
"How 'bout this one,</i>

497
00:31:53,392 --> 00:31:55,292
<i>how 'bout this one,
how 'bout this one?"</i>

498
00:31:55,293 --> 00:31:57,854
<i>And that way she would get
him out of his shell.</i>

499
00:32:04,269 --> 00:32:08,239
<i>Bettie is sexuality in
it's sparkly, cleanest,</i>

500
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,905
<i>most beautiful,
charming, smilingest.</i>

501
00:32:15,147 --> 00:32:17,048
<i>But there was some discussion</i>

502
00:32:17,049 --> 00:32:20,751
<i>about the kind of women</i>

503
00:32:20,752 --> 00:32:22,353
<i>that would do camera club shoots</i>

504
00:32:22,354 --> 00:32:26,190
<i>because primarily they were
nude, totally nude shoots.</i>

505
00:32:26,191 --> 00:32:28,259
<i>And Bettie would say,</i>

506
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:31,162
<i>"Whenever there was a shoot
that I was attending,</i>

507
00:32:31,163 --> 00:32:35,795
<i>where things started getting
sketchy, I got out of there."</i>

508
00:32:37,102 --> 00:32:40,604
<i>Everybody would have liked
to date Bettie Page,</i>

509
00:32:40,605 --> 00:32:43,541
<i>but nobody made the moves.</i>

510
00:32:43,542 --> 00:32:47,244
<i>Are there any boyfriends of
Bettie that you know of,</i>

511
00:32:47,245 --> 00:32:49,380
<i>that you've talked to
her that you know of?</i>

512
00:32:49,381 --> 00:32:52,116
I talked to a lot of guys,

513
00:32:52,117 --> 00:32:56,487
not only photographers,
but her lovers.

514
00:32:56,488 --> 00:32:58,355
<i>Charles West was one of them.</i>

515
00:32:58,356 --> 00:33:01,987
<i>Apparently met her
through a camera club.</i>

516
00:33:02,894 --> 00:33:08,365
<i>He did a notorious series
of photographs with Bettie.</i>

517
00:33:08,366 --> 00:33:11,869
<i>One day, a Saturday,
she and I were walking</i>

518
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:14,038
<i>down 5th Ave. at
Rockefeller Center.</i>

519
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:17,808
<i>She wore that same tight
translucent sweater.</i>

520
00:33:17,809 --> 00:33:22,580
<i>We were on our way to a shooting
session in the Time Life building.</i>

521
00:33:22,581 --> 00:33:26,283
<i>You should have seen the swiveling
heads, both male and female.</i>

522
00:33:26,284 --> 00:33:28,319
<i>My God, wasn't she beautiful.</i>

523
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,287
<i>Gorgeous.</i>

524
00:33:30,288 --> 00:33:33,090
<i>My photos were taken
very privately,</i>

525
00:33:33,091 --> 00:33:36,127
<i>I never intended for any
of them to be published.</i>

526
00:33:36,128 --> 00:33:38,996
<i>God gave her a lovely
body and she knew it.</i>

527
00:33:38,997 --> 00:33:41,991
<i>As a model, she used
it to full advantage.</i>

528
00:33:46,905 --> 00:33:50,875
<i>Her body was absolutely
without blemish,</i>

529
00:33:50,876 --> 00:33:54,245
<i>and everything</i>

530
00:33:54,246 --> 00:33:56,705
<i>exactly right in proportion.</i>

531
00:33:57,382 --> 00:34:00,417
<i>And that was the same with her face,
and you put the two together,</i>

532
00:34:00,418 --> 00:34:03,651
<i>and you had just about
the perfect woman.</i>

533
00:34:04,523 --> 00:34:08,381
<i>There was also a very sheer
pair of white panties.</i>

534
00:34:10,395 --> 00:34:15,425
<i>Also, super long black
opera length gloves.</i>

535
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:20,337
<i>She was absolutely pure,</i>

536
00:34:20,338 --> 00:34:22,506
<i>plain and natural.</i>

537
00:34:22,507 --> 00:34:25,543
<i>And of course she shows up
that way in her photographs.</i>

538
00:34:25,544 --> 00:34:29,641
<i>And I just think you see
the real girl there.</i>

539
00:34:31,082 --> 00:34:34,018
<i>No one ever dominated Betts,</i>

540
00:34:34,019 --> 00:34:36,220
<i>either physically
or psychologically.</i>

541
00:34:36,221 --> 00:34:40,113
<i>She was her own person and she never
could have mistreated anyone.</i>

542
00:34:43,962 --> 00:34:47,798
<i>Yes, she and I made love.</i>

543
00:34:47,799 --> 00:34:50,267
<i>And she was marvelous.</i>

544
00:34:50,268 --> 00:34:54,305
<i>She's an extraordinary creature.</i>

545
00:34:54,306 --> 00:34:57,038
<i>My memories of Betts
are ever present.</i>

546
00:35:29,641 --> 00:35:34,211
Nudity back then was,
was very unusual.

547
00:35:34,212 --> 00:35:35,946
<i>That was '52,</i>

548
00:35:35,947 --> 00:35:39,783
<i>a time of restrictive sexuality.</i>

549
00:35:39,784 --> 00:35:42,186
<i>You talked to your
friends in college even,</i>

550
00:35:42,187 --> 00:35:45,689
<i>and the fellow who had
been sexually active</i>

551
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:47,825
was the unusual guy.

552
00:35:47,826 --> 00:35:49,960
Know when and how

553
00:35:49,961 --> 00:35:51,662
you're going to say "no".

554
00:35:51,663 --> 00:35:55,332
<i>Take the case of the girl who
finds herself in this situation.</i>

555
00:35:55,333 --> 00:35:57,635
Say, is anybody else hungry?

556
00:35:57,636 --> 00:36:02,234
How about it you two, couldn't we
go someplace for something to eat?

557
00:36:04,342 --> 00:36:07,778
<i>I was on my way into
the army at that time,</i>

558
00:36:07,779 --> 00:36:09,747
<i>on my way to Korea eventually.</i>

559
00:36:09,748 --> 00:36:14,482
<i>So I thought it was a time
to have a little bit of fun.</i>

560
00:36:15,954 --> 00:36:19,551
<i>We were upstate New York on a farm.</i>

561
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,461
<i>But maybe this have been
your first opportunity</i>

562
00:36:24,462 --> 00:36:26,797
<i>to see a woman without
much clothes on?</i>

563
00:36:26,798 --> 00:36:29,099
Ah, that's not a bad guess.

564
00:36:32,904 --> 00:36:36,507
<i>The photographers all sort
of gravitated to Bettie Page.</i>

565
00:36:36,508 --> 00:36:38,876
<i>You were drawn as if by a magnet.</i>

566
00:36:38,877 --> 00:36:41,211
<i>She lit up the place.</i>

567
00:36:41,212 --> 00:36:43,113
<i>I don't think anybody
can really explain</i>

568
00:36:43,114 --> 00:36:47,651
<i>why some people have
that kind of charisma.</i>

569
00:36:47,652 --> 00:36:51,488
<i>It was kind of a
revolution for me really</i>

570
00:36:51,489 --> 00:36:55,916
<i>to see that openness.</i>

571
00:36:56,695 --> 00:36:59,029
<i>Somebody went to
the police about it,</i>

572
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:02,366
<i>some old fogy no doubt,
went to the police and said</i>

573
00:37:02,367 --> 00:37:05,135
<i>we were running around in
the woods nude out there.</i>

574
00:37:05,136 --> 00:37:07,104
<i>And here came a squad car.</i>

575
00:37:07,105 --> 00:37:11,141
<i>Calling car 6 and 7 eighths,
car 6 and 7 eighths.</i>

576
00:37:11,142 --> 00:37:13,243
<i>Here they are coming
with drawn guns,</i>

577
00:37:13,244 --> 00:37:16,146
<i>coming on a bunch of photographers.</i>

578
00:37:16,147 --> 00:37:19,350
I mean, what were we going to do?

579
00:37:19,351 --> 00:37:22,953
<i>I mean, this is absolute nonsense.</i>

580
00:37:22,954 --> 00:37:26,990
And they said, "Also, take the
pictures out of your cameras."

581
00:37:26,991 --> 00:37:29,193
<i>I opened the back of the camera.</i>

582
00:37:29,194 --> 00:37:31,462
The counter, which may have been,

583
00:37:31,463 --> 00:37:33,630
say on film number 5,

584
00:37:33,631 --> 00:37:35,666
<i>well, I snapped back to zero.</i>

585
00:37:35,667 --> 00:37:38,902
<i>I immediately closed the
camera and thought to myself,</i>

586
00:37:38,903 --> 00:37:42,539
why not try to keep

587
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:45,042
what films I have in the camera.

588
00:37:45,043 --> 00:37:46,944
And I showed it to one of
the deputies and I said,

589
00:37:46,945 --> 00:37:50,214
<i>"Look, you see, the
counter's on zero,</i>

590
00:37:50,215 --> 00:37:52,850
<i>but to tell you the truth I
have a new roll in there,</i>

591
00:37:52,851 --> 00:37:55,185
<i>I'd rather not expose it
by opening the back."</i>

592
00:37:55,186 --> 00:37:57,855
<i>I said, "Okay if I
keep it that way?"</i>

593
00:37:57,856 --> 00:37:59,089
<i>And he said sure.</i>

594
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:02,826
<i>But I didn't come upon the idea
of holding onto those photos</i>

595
00:38:02,827 --> 00:38:05,320
<i>until I saw it snap back to zero.</i>

596
00:38:34,993 --> 00:38:36,994
<i>The charming thing was that</i>

597
00:38:36,995 --> 00:38:40,130
<i>a little kitten wandered by.</i>

598
00:38:40,131 --> 00:38:42,466
<i>And she picked it up,</i>

599
00:38:42,467 --> 00:38:44,368
<i>and she held it to her breast.</i>

600
00:38:44,369 --> 00:38:47,271
<i>I found that exquisite.</i>

601
00:38:47,272 --> 00:38:52,166
<i>And I did take a picture of that
but half of it was destroyed.</i>

602
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:06,123
One of the deputies said something,

603
00:39:06,124 --> 00:39:08,425
which was rather nasty,

604
00:39:08,426 --> 00:39:11,094
but I do remember her saying,

605
00:39:11,095 --> 00:39:14,264
<i>"Don't you talk to me like that.</i>

606
00:39:14,265 --> 00:39:16,500
<i>I won't have it."</i>

607
00:39:16,501 --> 00:39:17,968
<i>And I think she had more courage</i>

608
00:39:17,969 --> 00:39:21,338
<i>than the dozen and a half
photographers that were there.</i>

609
00:39:21,339 --> 00:39:24,408
They decided to charge the
guys for disturbing the peace,

610
00:39:24,409 --> 00:39:27,678
<i>and the girls for
indecent exposure.</i>

611
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:30,714
<i>She was just terribly
offended by it.</i>

612
00:39:30,715 --> 00:39:33,083
<i>Bettie says, "I'm not indecent.</i>

613
00:39:33,084 --> 00:39:35,986
<i>I will not plead guilty to that."</i>

614
00:39:35,987 --> 00:39:37,988
<i>And we sat there in the anteroom,</i>

615
00:39:37,989 --> 00:39:40,914
<i>outside the court
room for five hours.</i>

616
00:39:52,337 --> 00:39:56,840
<i>Bettie demanded that this
release form be rewritten</i>

617
00:39:56,841 --> 00:40:00,699
<i>so that it didn't say
"indecent exposure".</i>

618
00:40:05,216 --> 00:40:07,084
<i>And the judge warned us</i>

619
00:40:07,085 --> 00:40:09,186
<i>never to come in his county again.</i>

620
00:40:10,822 --> 00:40:14,791
<i>Her being put in jail
because she was posing,</i>

621
00:40:14,792 --> 00:40:17,394
<i>making a living, gave
her pause for thought.</i>

622
00:40:17,395 --> 00:40:20,130
<i>She really had never considered
that it could happen to her.</i>

623
00:40:20,131 --> 00:40:23,800
<i>And in fact, it was an alarm
to wake her up to the fact</i>

624
00:40:23,801 --> 00:40:27,170
<i>that a lot of people did not
like what she was doing.</i>

625
00:40:30,708 --> 00:40:35,045
On Friday, we shall continue the
investigation of the relationship

626
00:40:35,046 --> 00:40:38,847
of pornographic materials
to delinquency.

627
00:40:39,517 --> 00:40:41,418
<i>In the 1950s,</i>

628
00:40:41,419 --> 00:40:43,854
<i>the repression was coming
from the government.</i>

629
00:40:43,855 --> 00:40:47,190
And it also involved Kefauver
and his investigations,

630
00:40:47,191 --> 00:40:49,693
in terms of pornography and crime.

631
00:40:49,694 --> 00:40:51,995
You couldn't sell in many places

632
00:40:51,996 --> 00:40:57,167
a magazine that had
the kinds of nudity

633
00:40:57,168 --> 00:41:00,404
that we see in a modern <i>Playboy.</i>

634
00:41:00,405 --> 00:41:02,873
<i>That was considered going too far.</i>

635
00:41:02,874 --> 00:41:06,677
<i>I never had any bad feelings</i>

636
00:41:06,678 --> 00:41:08,378
<i>about posing in the nude</i>

637
00:41:08,379 --> 00:41:11,782
<i>or semi-nude outfits.</i>

638
00:41:11,783 --> 00:41:15,152
<i>I found out I could make more
money posing in two hours</i>

639
00:41:15,153 --> 00:41:18,147
<i>than I'd make all
week as a secretary.</i>

640
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:21,792
<i>All the girls who worked
for Robert Harrison</i>

641
00:41:21,793 --> 00:41:25,362
<i>would end up posing
for Irving Klaw.</i>

642
00:41:25,363 --> 00:41:29,199
<i>He had a big business,
he and his sister Paula,</i>

643
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,502
<i>selling movie star pictures
before they got into, locally,</i>

644
00:41:32,503 --> 00:41:35,606
<i>shooting models in New York.</i>

645
00:41:35,607 --> 00:41:38,642
And one of the cameramen
brought her in and said,

646
00:41:38,643 --> 00:41:42,112
she's a super model,
she works well,

647
00:41:42,113 --> 00:41:44,948
and she's a love, give her a shot.

648
00:41:44,949 --> 00:41:47,284
<i>And we did. You should
have seen her then.</i>

649
00:41:47,285 --> 00:41:49,886
<i>The long black hair
and always smiling,</i>

650
00:41:49,887 --> 00:41:54,087
<i>giggling and whatever, she
was so great to work with.</i>

651
00:41:55,293 --> 00:41:57,661
<i>She loved posing.</i>

652
00:42:03,534 --> 00:42:06,970
<i>Irving Klaw, he was
a real sweet fella.</i>

653
00:42:06,971 --> 00:42:09,840
<i>He was a big fat chubby guy.</i>

654
00:42:09,841 --> 00:42:12,542
<i>And he was sort of short
and he was almost bald.</i>

655
00:42:12,543 --> 00:42:15,278
<i>But he was so nice.</i>

656
00:42:15,279 --> 00:42:18,582
<i>He never made any passes
at the women or anything.</i>

657
00:42:18,583 --> 00:42:21,785
<i>They would bring food there,
sandwiches and all for us.</i>

658
00:42:21,786 --> 00:42:24,621
<i>They were always very
generous about that.</i>

659
00:42:24,622 --> 00:42:28,492
<i>He got some of the ideas
from some of the customers.</i>

660
00:42:28,493 --> 00:42:31,128
<i>And he would sort of
talk to me about,</i>

661
00:42:31,129 --> 00:42:33,296
<i>"What do you think of this and
what do you think of that",</i>

662
00:42:33,297 --> 00:42:36,495
<i>and between the two of
us we'd figure it out.</i>

663
00:42:38,369 --> 00:42:40,570
In some of her earliest
Irving Klaw photos,

664
00:42:40,571 --> 00:42:42,205
Bettie looked a little gawky.

665
00:42:42,206 --> 00:42:44,708
<i>But Klaw would give her
a set of these photos.</i>

666
00:42:44,709 --> 00:42:48,145
<i>She could summarize what
she was doing right</i>

667
00:42:48,146 --> 00:42:49,513
<i>and what she was doing wrong,</i>

668
00:42:49,514 --> 00:42:52,644
<i>and I think she became
a much better model.</i>

669
00:42:53,351 --> 00:42:55,886
<i>She liked being in
front of the camera.</i>

670
00:42:55,887 --> 00:42:58,055
<i>She enjoyed her body.</i>

671
00:42:58,056 --> 00:42:59,823
<i>She liked the way she looked.</i>

672
00:42:59,824 --> 00:43:01,491
<i>She liked her hair.</i>

673
00:43:01,492 --> 00:43:04,122
<i>She enjoyed herself.</i>

674
00:43:05,263 --> 00:43:07,497
<i>She never cried about anything...</i>

675
00:43:07,498 --> 00:43:09,666
<i>"It's too tight,
'"'It's too loose,"</i>

676
00:43:09,667 --> 00:43:11,768
<i>"Don't do that, " or anything.</i>

677
00:43:11,769 --> 00:43:14,771
<i>She was just a super
lady to work with.</i>

678
00:43:14,772 --> 00:43:19,910
<i>Irving said I was his most
famous model that he ever had,</i>

679
00:43:19,911 --> 00:43:23,940
<i>and he had some 1,500
pictures of me going.</i>

680
00:43:25,149 --> 00:43:27,744
<i>A lot of them to service men.</i>

681
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:31,788
<i>We made this set of
pictures, we'd advertise it,</i>

682
00:43:31,789 --> 00:43:35,358
<i>and we noticed the
increase in sales.</i>

683
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:38,095
<i>One of the biggest sellers</i>

684
00:43:38,096 --> 00:43:39,696
<i>is a picture of me wearing</i>

685
00:43:39,697 --> 00:43:42,999
<i>my little leopard-skin bikini,
and I'm looking real mean,</i>

686
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,837
<i>holding this whip with
one foot up on a stool</i>

687
00:43:46,838 --> 00:43:50,073
<i>and a cigarette dangling
out the side of my mouth.</i>

688
00:43:50,074 --> 00:43:52,142
<i>And the teenagers.</i>

689
00:43:52,143 --> 00:43:55,846
<i>Irving said that's their
favorite picture of me now.</i>

690
00:43:55,847 --> 00:43:57,714
<i>You know, I never smoked.</i>

691
00:43:59,016 --> 00:44:00,751
<i>I hate cigarettes.</i>

692
00:44:00,752 --> 00:44:05,322
Well, I shot stills but there was
more money into making films

693
00:44:05,323 --> 00:44:08,225
so we started with the 16mm,

694
00:44:08,226 --> 00:44:10,060
because that was very
popular at that time.

695
00:44:20,104 --> 00:44:23,306
<i>Well, she's a drama
queen from a golden age</i>

696
00:44:23,307 --> 00:44:25,776
<i>Talking about the
curves of Bettie Page</i>

697
00:44:25,777 --> 00:44:28,445
<i>Flinging through the pages
though, I just can't wait</i>

698
00:44:28,446 --> 00:44:30,714
<i>She's the kind of woman
that I want to date</i>

699
00:44:30,715 --> 00:44:33,216
<i>Oh, Bettie, Bettie, Bettie, Bettie</i>

700
00:44:33,217 --> 00:44:35,418
<i>Oh, Bettie, uh-huh-huh</i>

701
00:44:35,419 --> 00:44:37,921
<i>Oh, Bettie, Bettie, Bettie, Bettie</i>

702
00:44:37,922 --> 00:44:40,357
<i>Oh, Bettie, yeah</i>

703
00:44:40,358 --> 00:44:42,826
<i>I'm gonna run to you, girl,
I'm on the rampage</i>

704
00:44:42,827 --> 00:44:46,025
<i>Just want Bettie,
Bettie Page, yeah!</i>

705
00:44:58,509 --> 00:45:00,577
<i>Seven inch heels,</i>

706
00:45:00,578 --> 00:45:03,947
<i>one pair, that he kept for me only,</i>

707
00:45:03,948 --> 00:45:05,916
<i>that fitted me just fine
that I could wiggle around,</i>

708
00:45:05,917 --> 00:45:08,418
<i>and move around,
and kick around in those.</i>

709
00:45:08,419 --> 00:45:11,922
<i>Yeah, Bettie could walk great in
high heels, unlike most girls.</i>

710
00:45:11,923 --> 00:45:14,724
<i>Most girls, they could
walk in high heels,</i>

711
00:45:14,725 --> 00:45:17,561
<i>some of them, but they
didn't look natural.</i>

712
00:45:17,562 --> 00:45:19,129
<i>Bettie, she could move
in 'em just like,</i>

713
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:22,499
just like she was in moccasins.

714
00:45:28,206 --> 00:45:32,609
<i>My brother would set it
up and I would direct,</i>

715
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:34,477
<i>and I worked the 16mm.</i>

716
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:38,682
<i>Teaserama is a complete,</i>

717
00:45:38,683 --> 00:45:40,483
<i>all new burlesque show,</i>

718
00:45:40,484 --> 00:45:43,253
<i>filmed in beautiful
new Eastman Color.</i>

719
00:45:43,254 --> 00:45:47,920
<i>Teaserama features the world's
most beautiful, exotic girls.</i>

720
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:52,596
<i>Tempest Storm is the girl
with a 40-plus bust,</i>

721
00:45:52,597 --> 00:45:55,332
<i>who goes 3D two better!</i>

722
00:45:55,333 --> 00:46:00,337
<i>So big, we had to use wide
screen to film Teaserama.</i>

723
00:46:00,338 --> 00:46:05,508
<i>Bettie Page, the nation's
top pinup queen.</i>

724
00:46:05,509 --> 00:46:10,346
<i>There's sexy seconds to
every minute in Teaserama.</i>

725
00:46:11,916 --> 00:46:17,185
<i>In one of them starring
Tempest Storm, I played her maid.</i>

726
00:46:19,857 --> 00:46:21,958
<i>And I also introduced the acts</i>

727
00:46:21,959 --> 00:46:24,793
<i>wearing my bikinis
and other costumes.</i>

728
00:46:29,834 --> 00:46:33,303
<i>And then I did a
little dance number.</i>

729
00:46:33,304 --> 00:46:36,172
<i>It was a nothing tap
dance I made up</i>

730
00:46:36,173 --> 00:46:40,744
<i>within a half an hour before
the movie was to be shot.</i>

731
00:46:40,745 --> 00:46:44,514
<i>There was no sex in those
movies that we shot.</i>

732
00:46:44,515 --> 00:46:46,849
<i>It was just fun.</i>

733
00:46:48,452 --> 00:46:51,688
<i>Irving Klaw would pay me $150</i>

734
00:46:51,689 --> 00:46:53,523
<i>every time I did one
of these movies.</i>

735
00:46:53,524 --> 00:46:57,761
<i>And I would take the money and go
to visit my mother in Pittsburgh,</i>

736
00:46:57,762 --> 00:46:59,763
<i>or my brothers in Nashville,</i>

737
00:46:59,764 --> 00:47:02,564
<i>or my sister in Coral Gables.</i>

738
00:47:07,471 --> 00:47:11,474
Bettie happened to be in
Miami on a little vacation.

739
00:47:11,475 --> 00:47:13,610
<i>And she gave me a call.</i>

740
00:47:13,611 --> 00:47:15,745
<i>And she said she was
a New York model.</i>

741
00:47:15,746 --> 00:47:18,281
And I said, "Oh," and
I was very impressed.

742
00:47:18,282 --> 00:47:20,517
<i>I posed for Bunny</i>

743
00:47:20,518 --> 00:47:24,321
<i>in Florida in the spring of 1954.</i>

744
00:47:24,322 --> 00:47:27,857
<i>She had just started
out as a photographer,</i>

745
00:47:27,858 --> 00:47:30,026
<i>she used to be a pinup model.</i>

746
00:47:30,027 --> 00:47:32,729
I said, "You do pinup modeling?"

747
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:34,464
And she says, "I do nudes, too."

748
00:47:34,465 --> 00:47:37,968
And when I heard that she did
nudes, I was really excited

749
00:47:37,969 --> 00:47:39,936
because I had never photographed

750
00:47:39,937 --> 00:47:42,205
<i>a professional nude model before.</i>

751
00:47:42,206 --> 00:47:46,872
<i>So I told her to come on over,
I would use her sight unseen.</i>

752
00:47:48,379 --> 00:47:51,281
<i>Bettie was so perfect in every way.</i>

753
00:47:51,282 --> 00:47:55,986
<i>It would be hard for anybody to
take a bad picture of Bettie.</i>

754
00:47:55,987 --> 00:47:57,587
<i>Because she was a woman,</i>

755
00:47:57,588 --> 00:48:01,591
<i>I felt more comfortable
posing in the nude for Bunny.</i>

756
00:48:01,592 --> 00:48:04,894
<i>And we'd go out there
about 7:00 in the morning</i>

757
00:48:04,895 --> 00:48:09,332
<i>before anybody came on the beaches
and do our shooting then.</i>

758
00:48:13,871 --> 00:48:17,741
<i>We worked so well together
because she caught on</i>

759
00:48:17,742 --> 00:48:20,110
<i>to what I was trying
to get out of her.</i>

760
00:48:20,111 --> 00:48:24,214
<i>And she just played like she was a
teenager in front of the camera,</i>

761
00:48:24,215 --> 00:48:27,017
<i>and followed every
direction I gave her.</i>

762
00:48:27,018 --> 00:48:28,551
<i>And that was a thrill too,</i>

763
00:48:28,552 --> 00:48:33,946
<i>because I had not worked with
somebody that professional before.</i>

764
00:48:34,091 --> 00:48:37,327
<i>You knew she was trying
to look her very best.</i>

765
00:48:37,328 --> 00:48:39,696
<i>She would work on her tan</i>

766
00:48:39,697 --> 00:48:42,866
<i>and sunbathe the nude for
a certain time everyday</i>

767
00:48:42,867 --> 00:48:45,861
<i>so that her skin would
be so glorious.</i>

768
00:48:46,604 --> 00:48:50,473
<i>Bettie had a different
torso than most girls.</i>

769
00:48:50,474 --> 00:48:53,176
<i>Her bone structure there,</i>

770
00:48:53,177 --> 00:48:54,677
<i>close to her waistline,</i>

771
00:48:54,678 --> 00:48:58,415
<i>went way in to a very tiny waist.</i>

772
00:48:58,416 --> 00:49:02,118
<i>And there are very few girls
that are built like that.</i>

773
00:49:02,119 --> 00:49:05,822
<i>I was 36-24-37.</i>

774
00:49:05,823 --> 00:49:09,859
<i>I worked out at the health
club three times a week.</i>

775
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:12,128
<i>I've always liked to exercise.</i>

776
00:49:12,129 --> 00:49:16,124
<i>I wanted to keep in
shape for my modeling.</i>

777
00:49:17,601 --> 00:49:20,970
<i>She lied to me about her age.</i>

778
00:49:20,971 --> 00:49:24,674
<i>She told me she was 24 when she posed
for me but she was much older.</i>

779
00:49:24,675 --> 00:49:26,940
<i>I think that she was 32.</i>

780
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:33,450
<i>We shot pictures at
Kiddie Land Park.</i>

781
00:49:33,451 --> 00:49:35,285
<i>And I put her in a bikini</i>

782
00:49:35,286 --> 00:49:37,420
<i>and shot her on the merry-go-round</i>

783
00:49:37,421 --> 00:49:39,489
<i>and all these stupid rides.</i>

784
00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:42,292
<i>And she, she had a ball, you know.</i>

785
00:49:42,293 --> 00:49:45,462
<i>We had to go before
they opened up at 10:00</i>

786
00:49:45,463 --> 00:49:50,100
<i>because I was getting worried with
the briefness of the bathing suits.</i>

787
00:49:50,101 --> 00:49:54,471
<i>I was a little scared and I thought,
"Bettie, we might get arrested.</i>

788
00:49:54,472 --> 00:49:56,473
<i>How do you feel about that?"</i>

789
00:49:56,474 --> 00:49:59,876
<i>And he says, "Oh, I wouldn't
want to, but you know.</i>

790
00:49:59,877 --> 00:50:01,478
<i>What are we going to do?"</i>

791
00:50:01,479 --> 00:50:04,614
So we just took our chances.

792
00:50:04,615 --> 00:50:08,246
<i>So they're very sensual pictures.</i>

793
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,545
<i>Very sexy.</i>

794
00:50:17,995 --> 00:50:21,131
<i>We went out on the boat and
it was late in the afternoon,</i>

795
00:50:21,132 --> 00:50:24,567
<i>and the sun was
already getting low.</i>

796
00:50:24,568 --> 00:50:28,238
<i>But that made for good
shadowing of Bettie's body</i>

797
00:50:28,239 --> 00:50:30,940
<i>for some beautiful
nudes on the boat.</i>

798
00:50:30,941 --> 00:50:34,110
<i>And she actually caught a fish
while I was shooting her.</i>

799
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:36,246
It was unbelievable.

800
00:50:36,247 --> 00:50:38,882
<i>I had never seen anybody
catch a fish so fast.</i>

801
00:50:38,883 --> 00:50:40,950
<i>We must have been in good waters.</i>

802
00:50:40,951 --> 00:50:44,854
<i>But that picture that you see
of Bettie holding the fish up.</i>

803
00:50:44,855 --> 00:50:46,688
<i>That was for real.</i>

804
00:50:48,125 --> 00:50:50,426
While we were shooting some
pinups on the beach one day,

805
00:50:50,427 --> 00:50:53,930
I asked Bettie, "Are you
afraid of wild animals?"

806
00:50:56,867 --> 00:50:59,802
<i>I had seen too many
Tarzan movies, I think.</i>

807
00:50:59,803 --> 00:51:04,140
<i>She set up a session for
me up in Boca Raton</i>

808
00:51:04,141 --> 00:51:08,238
<i>at Little Africa to
pose with the animals.</i>

809
00:51:10,214 --> 00:51:12,882
<i>When you come into Africa USA,</i>

810
00:51:12,883 --> 00:51:15,952
<i>they had a greeter at the gate,</i>

811
00:51:15,953 --> 00:51:17,854
<i>dressed all up like a native.</i>

812
00:51:17,855 --> 00:51:20,557
<i>I said, "Would you like to take
some pictures with my model?"</i>

813
00:51:20,558 --> 00:51:23,483
<i>He said, "Sure."
He was happy about that.</i>

814
00:51:24,261 --> 00:51:26,896
<i>I was very fond of
my one-piece outfit</i>

815
00:51:26,897 --> 00:51:30,033
<i>that I made with the
scallops and high bottoms.</i>

816
00:51:30,034 --> 00:51:32,068
<i>I was dressed just like a cheetah.</i>

817
00:51:32,069 --> 00:51:34,304
<i>There wasn't much to
the bottom of it,</i>

818
00:51:34,305 --> 00:51:38,508
<i>but maybe that was the
most alluring part of it.</i>

819
00:51:38,509 --> 00:51:40,810
<i>I was very proud of that design.</i>

820
00:51:44,815 --> 00:51:48,351
<i>The pictures that sold the
most were with two cheetahs.</i>

821
00:51:48,352 --> 00:51:50,086
<i>Beautiful animals.</i>

822
00:51:50,087 --> 00:51:53,790
<i>They had been sick the night before</i>

823
00:51:53,791 --> 00:51:56,059
<i>and they were in a bad temper.</i>

824
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:59,293
<i>I was afraid to be around 'em.</i>

825
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:04,667
<i>The trainer said, "Please, don't
let go of that chain, Bettie,</i>

826
00:52:04,668 --> 00:52:06,302
<i>because if they run,</i>

827
00:52:06,303 --> 00:52:09,297
<i>they run 55 miles and hour
and they'll be gone."</i>

828
00:52:10,407 --> 00:52:12,709
<i>She kept control,</i>

829
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:14,975
<i>and we got great pictures.</i>

830
00:52:18,048 --> 00:52:20,049
<i>All my life I had worshiped</i>

831
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:23,386
<i>these pinup girls on the
calendars, and I thought,</i>

832
00:52:23,387 --> 00:52:26,889
<i>"I'd love to shoot a calendar of
someone as beautiful as Bettie."</i>

833
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:30,793
And I thought, the holiday
season will be coming up soon.

834
00:52:30,794 --> 00:52:35,064
<i>And I had this little
white Christmas Tree.</i>

835
00:52:35,065 --> 00:52:37,700
<i>And I had her pose,</i>

836
00:52:37,701 --> 00:52:40,570
<i>kneeling on a white shag rug.</i>

837
00:52:40,571 --> 00:52:43,506
<i>I didn't know that Bunny Yeager</i>

838
00:52:43,507 --> 00:52:48,578
<i>was going to send pictures to
Mr. Hefner for Playboy Magazine.</i>

839
00:52:48,579 --> 00:52:51,614
<i>She was Miss January of 1955,</i>

840
00:52:51,615 --> 00:52:55,451
<i>but Bettie had a fame
that kind of coincided</i>

841
00:52:55,452 --> 00:52:59,622
<i>and predated her
appearance in Playboy.</i>

842
00:52:59,623 --> 00:53:02,125
<i>You know, that little
Santa Claus hat</i>

843
00:53:02,126 --> 00:53:04,494
<i>and I'm winking, and I'm
sitting on my knees</i>

844
00:53:04,495 --> 00:53:10,133
<i>with a little Christmas Tree
ball covering "you know where".</i>

845
00:53:13,871 --> 00:53:18,002
She had a very unique look and
also a very unique attitude.

846
00:53:25,249 --> 00:53:27,050
<i>Back in New York,</i>

847
00:53:27,051 --> 00:53:28,918
<i>you couldn't work for Irving</i>

848
00:53:28,919 --> 00:53:32,722
<i>without doing about an hour or
an hour and a half of bondage,</i>

849
00:53:32,723 --> 00:53:34,988
<i>or you didn't get paid.</i>

850
00:53:44,568 --> 00:53:47,870
<i>Bondage, I'm noted for being</i>

851
00:53:47,871 --> 00:53:50,940
<i>the number one bondage
queen, they call me.</i>

852
00:54:03,654 --> 00:54:06,189
<i>Most of the work came</i>

853
00:54:06,190 --> 00:54:09,158
<i>from requests he would
get in the mail,</i>

854
00:54:09,159 --> 00:54:11,461
<i>from doctors, lawyers,</i>

855
00:54:11,462 --> 00:54:13,262
<i>businessmen,</i>

856
00:54:13,263 --> 00:54:16,899
<i>men up in high society even,</i>

857
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:19,791
<i>wanted all of these things.</i>

858
00:54:22,373 --> 00:54:25,508
<i>One was a big official
in the government</i>

859
00:54:25,509 --> 00:54:28,711
<i>and one guy was a big lawyer.</i>

860
00:54:28,712 --> 00:54:30,880
<i>Are either of these
guys still alive?</i>

861
00:54:30,881 --> 00:54:32,749
No, I don't think so.

862
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:34,851
<i>So you care to say who they were?</i>

863
00:54:34,852 --> 00:54:37,117
No. Promises.

864
00:54:38,021 --> 00:54:40,456
<i>The guy came in with all
the rubber outfits.</i>

865
00:54:40,457 --> 00:54:42,291
<i>And there was leather.</i>

866
00:54:42,292 --> 00:54:45,161
<i>There's a big leather
fetish out there.</i>

867
00:54:45,162 --> 00:54:48,164
<i>Men wanted her with the boots on.</i>

868
00:54:48,165 --> 00:54:52,399
<i>Pay for it, bring the
costumes, we'll do it.</i>

869
00:54:53,537 --> 00:54:57,407
<i>For some reason,
men like to see girls,</i>

870
00:54:57,408 --> 00:54:59,308
<i>one spanking the other one.</i>

871
00:54:59,309 --> 00:55:01,377
<i>Why, I don't know.</i>

872
00:55:01,378 --> 00:55:05,982
<i>And they liked to see
women helpless, tied up.</i>

873
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:08,749
<i>I never thought it was
anything strange.</i>

874
00:55:10,287 --> 00:55:14,824
<i>Bettie had not been exposed
to this type of culture.</i>

875
00:55:14,825 --> 00:55:18,127
She was instructed that
this is what the job was.

876
00:55:18,128 --> 00:55:19,695
To her it was acting.

877
00:55:19,696 --> 00:55:23,166
<i>Which she enjoyed doing,
which is why her bondage stuff</i>

878
00:55:23,167 --> 00:55:26,536
<i>is just so terrific,
because she's acting.</i>

879
00:55:27,704 --> 00:55:30,800
<i>She's making believe
that she's terrified.</i>

880
00:55:32,142 --> 00:55:34,544
<i>For the most part, anybody
in a bondage photograph is</i>

881
00:55:34,545 --> 00:55:37,680
<i>just going on like
half-assed, hardly doing it.</i>

882
00:55:37,681 --> 00:55:40,106
<i>Bettie was acting.</i>

883
00:55:51,995 --> 00:55:55,831
<i>Paula, she was the only
one that ever tied us up.</i>

884
00:55:56,633 --> 00:55:59,335
<i>She didn't hurt us, she was
very careful about it.</i>

885
00:55:59,336 --> 00:56:02,371
<i>She felt safe with me being there.</i>

886
00:56:02,372 --> 00:56:04,974
Don't hurt the babies, you know.

887
00:56:04,975 --> 00:56:09,312
<i>Some of the pictures looked
like I was really being hurt.</i>

888
00:56:09,313 --> 00:56:13,716
<i>There was only one time
that I was ever frightened.</i>

889
00:56:13,717 --> 00:56:18,588
<i>Some guy, some lawyer I think
he was, wanted me tied up.</i>

890
00:56:18,589 --> 00:56:21,858
<i>And my feet were off the
ground about six inches.</i>

891
00:56:21,859 --> 00:56:25,828
<i>I thought my arm holes were going
to pull out of the sockets.</i>

892
00:56:25,829 --> 00:56:27,497
<i>And I said, "Hurry up,
it's hurting me."</i>

893
00:56:27,498 --> 00:56:30,566
<i>And they kept shooting me
from all kinds of angles.</i>

894
00:56:30,567 --> 00:56:33,603
<i>And finally they let me down.</i>

895
00:56:33,604 --> 00:56:37,607
<i>And Irving later told me that
those pictures sold more</i>

896
00:56:37,608 --> 00:56:39,709
<i>than any picture
that he'd ever sold</i>

897
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:41,978
<i>of movie stars than anybody else.</i>

898
00:56:51,788 --> 00:56:55,157
<i>About two months later...</i>

899
00:56:56,093 --> 00:57:00,696
<i>I was doing a little
16mm wrestling movie.</i>

900
00:57:00,697 --> 00:57:02,932
<i>I heard something pop.</i>

901
00:57:02,933 --> 00:57:06,569
<i>I couldn't straighten out
my right knee at all.</i>

902
00:57:06,570 --> 00:57:09,071
<i>Finally, I called a doctor.</i>

903
00:57:09,072 --> 00:57:12,341
<i>He said, "It'll be about
a six inch scar."</i>

904
00:57:12,342 --> 00:57:16,974
<i>He said, "You won't be able to do
your pinup modeling anymore."</i>

905
00:57:18,348 --> 00:57:21,851
<i>I was lying in bed
feeling very unhappy</i>

906
00:57:21,852 --> 00:57:25,721
<i>at the thought that I wouldn't
be able to model anymore.</i>

907
00:57:25,722 --> 00:57:29,258
<i>And all of a sudden,
I heard a man's voice</i>

908
00:57:29,259 --> 00:57:34,063
<i>just as loud and clear as
you'd hear any human talk.</i>

909
00:57:34,064 --> 00:57:39,035
<i>He said, "Bettie, you can
straighten out your knee. Try it."</i>

910
00:57:39,036 --> 00:57:44,073
<i>And within a couple of seconds I was
able to straighten out my knee.</i>

911
00:57:44,074 --> 00:57:48,706
<i>I knew immediately it
was the voice of God.</i>

912
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:52,471
<i>She was the girl next door.</i>

913
00:57:53,083 --> 00:57:58,721
Just so good, and went
to church on Sunday,

914
00:57:58,722 --> 00:58:02,491
that women identified with,
that they liked the idea

915
00:58:02,492 --> 00:58:04,560
that they could exude sexuality

916
00:58:04,561 --> 00:58:08,598
<i>and not be thought of as a tramp,</i>

917
00:58:08,599 --> 00:58:11,867
<i>that she's playing a role,</i>

918
00:58:11,868 --> 00:58:14,470
<i>whether it be dominatrix</i>

919
00:58:14,471 --> 00:58:16,138
<i>or the girl next door,</i>

920
00:58:16,139 --> 00:58:20,475
and it was never demeaning
at any point whatsoever.

921
00:58:25,649 --> 00:58:28,317
<i>The craziest request I ever had,</i>

922
00:58:28,318 --> 00:58:31,287
<i>this guy wanted me to pose</i>

923
00:58:31,288 --> 00:58:33,889
<i>in a black leather pony outfit</i>

924
00:58:33,890 --> 00:58:36,926
<i>that he sent to Irving and Paula.</i>

925
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:39,996
<i>I had to get on all
fours like a horse,</i>

926
00:58:39,997 --> 00:58:43,232
<i>and my head covered
up with this hood on.</i>

927
00:58:43,233 --> 00:58:46,736
<i>I said, "Well, how would he even
know who was under there at all?"</i>

928
00:58:46,737 --> 00:58:49,639
<i>You couldn't even see my face.</i>

929
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:53,209
<i>We died laughing about it.</i>

930
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:55,277
And some we turned away.

931
00:58:55,278 --> 00:58:59,115
<i>Well, there were no
nudes, that's number one.</i>

932
00:58:59,116 --> 00:59:03,119
<i>If there were men in the
pictures, it was pornographic.</i>

933
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:06,055
And we didn't want to sell
anything that was pornographic.

934
00:59:27,077 --> 00:59:29,879
<i>These two guys came to me and said,</i>

935
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:33,647
<i>"Bettie, we want you to testify against
Irving Klaw as a pornographer."</i>

936
00:59:34,418 --> 00:59:37,653
<i>I said, "What are you talking about?
Irving never even did nudes."</i>

937
00:59:37,654 --> 00:59:40,856
They'd come in with
search warrants.

938
00:59:40,857 --> 00:59:42,992
<i>They took a bunch of stuff.</i>

939
00:59:42,993 --> 00:59:46,929
<i>They took a lot of the photographs
and negatives of the models.</i>

940
00:59:46,930 --> 00:59:51,600
<i>They confiscated our mail and
we were getting bad publicity.</i>

941
00:59:57,841 --> 00:59:59,675
<i>Repercussions from the
New York hearings</i>

942
00:59:59,676 --> 01:00:02,778
<i>have been nationwide, with
contempt and perjury citations</i>

943
01:00:02,779 --> 01:00:05,281
<i>indicated by the committee.</i>

944
01:00:05,282 --> 01:00:07,483
<i>Now there's supposed
to be a young boy,</i>

945
01:00:07,484 --> 01:00:11,854
<i>I think he was 17 years
old, somewhere in Florida.</i>

946
01:00:11,855 --> 01:00:14,190
<i>The Kefauver committee
was blaming me</i>

947
01:00:14,191 --> 01:00:16,592
<i>for contributing to
juvenile delinquency</i>

948
01:00:16,593 --> 01:00:20,429
<i>because this boy killed himself looking
at one of my bondage pictures.</i>

949
01:00:20,430 --> 01:00:23,526
<i>What would I have to do with that?</i>

950
01:00:24,201 --> 01:00:26,602
<i>Sir, I direct your
attention specifically</i>

951
01:00:26,603 --> 01:00:30,272
<i>to page 3 of this publication,
showing a young lady trussed up.</i>

952
01:00:30,273 --> 01:00:32,074
<i>And ask you to look
at that picture,</i>

953
01:00:32,075 --> 01:00:35,111
<i>with her arms tied behind
her back, her mouth gagged.</i>

954
01:00:35,112 --> 01:00:36,679
There is a definite connection

955
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:40,049
between this sort of
thing and his death.

956
01:00:41,818 --> 01:00:45,221
<i>They made me come
down to the courthouse,</i>

957
01:00:45,222 --> 01:00:48,457
<i>and they had me sit
outside the courtroom</i>

958
01:00:48,458 --> 01:00:51,486
<i>while they had Irving on the stand.</i>

959
01:00:52,496 --> 01:00:56,532
<i>Mr. Chairman, our
investigation reveals</i>

960
01:00:56,533 --> 01:01:01,871
<i>that Mr. Klaw is one of
the largest distributors</i>

961
01:01:01,872 --> 01:01:05,441
<i>of obscene, lewd,
and fetish photographs</i>

962
01:01:05,442 --> 01:01:08,377
<i>throughout the country by mail.</i>

963
01:01:08,378 --> 01:01:11,547
I decline to answer

964
01:01:11,548 --> 01:01:15,751
under the Fifth Amendment
of the Constitution.

965
01:01:15,752 --> 01:01:20,389
Well, Mr. Klaw,
I must warn you that

966
01:01:20,390 --> 01:01:22,892
I'll have you cited for contempt.

967
01:01:22,893 --> 01:01:25,027
Do you still refuse to answer?

968
01:01:25,028 --> 01:01:27,563
I decline to answer.

969
01:01:27,564 --> 01:01:31,066
Would that be sufficient or should I say
it all the way through, Mr. Kefauver?

970
01:01:31,067 --> 01:01:33,135
<i>We're not asking any quarter</i>

971
01:01:33,136 --> 01:01:35,367
<i>nor giving any quarter, Mr. Klaw.</i>

972
01:01:36,506 --> 01:01:37,940
<i>Those creeps.</i>

973
01:01:37,941 --> 01:01:39,742
<i>Ol' Kefauver and his committee.</i>

974
01:01:39,743 --> 01:01:43,279
<i>I told them, "I'm not testifying
and lying about Irving Klaw."</i>

975
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,648
<i>I said, "I don't care. You
can't force me to do it."</i>

976
01:01:45,649 --> 01:01:47,914
<i>I said, "I won't do it."</i>

977
01:01:52,455 --> 01:01:55,191
But we also went before the judge.

978
01:01:55,192 --> 01:01:58,594
<i>And the judge said, "You
want to keep your freedom,</i>

979
01:01:58,595 --> 01:02:01,997
<i>you have to destroy
all the negatives."</i>

980
01:02:01,998 --> 01:02:05,734
I said that was wrong.

981
01:02:05,735 --> 01:02:08,971
We have every right to do
and print whatever we like.

982
01:02:08,972 --> 01:02:11,169
We're not hurting anybody.

983
01:02:11,808 --> 01:02:16,579
<i>And so I was the one that was
in charge of chucking it away.</i>

984
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:18,948
<i>But I didn't.</i>

985
01:02:20,317 --> 01:02:24,753
We did hide them, until we
were sure that the courts

986
01:02:24,754 --> 01:02:26,522
would throw it out

987
01:02:26,523 --> 01:02:29,225
and agree that this
was not pornography.

988
01:02:29,226 --> 01:02:33,662
<i>I kept the ones I know I could
sell, just the ones with Bettie.</i>

989
01:02:33,663 --> 01:02:38,801
<i>I knew one day these
were going to be famous.</i>

990
01:02:38,802 --> 01:02:42,371
<i>She was able to sneak
a few of mine away</i>

991
01:02:42,372 --> 01:02:44,773
<i>that they didn't know about.</i>

992
01:02:44,774 --> 01:02:47,509
<i>Nearly all three-fourths
of his pictures</i>

993
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:50,346
<i>that he had taken in his
movie star photos and all,</i>

994
01:02:50,347 --> 01:02:51,847
<i>they were all burned.</i>

995
01:02:51,848 --> 01:02:53,883
<i>And it just ruined the poor man</i>

996
01:02:53,884 --> 01:02:57,947
<i>and put him in bad health,
and he ended up dying.</i>

997
01:03:01,892 --> 01:03:04,660
<i>I always thought,
live and let live.</i>

998
01:03:04,661 --> 01:03:06,662
<i>Let anybody do what they want to do</i>

999
01:03:06,663 --> 01:03:09,431
<i>as long as they're not
hurting anybody else.</i>

1000
01:03:09,432 --> 01:03:12,701
<i>I still feel that way.</i>

1001
01:03:12,702 --> 01:03:15,204
<i>There was a lot of
people in America</i>

1002
01:03:15,205 --> 01:03:17,907
<i>that would have considered
what you were doing</i>

1003
01:03:17,908 --> 01:03:19,708
<i>to be nasty back in those days.</i>

1004
01:03:19,709 --> 01:03:24,313
<i>I never thought I was
doing anything wrong.</i>

1005
01:03:24,314 --> 01:03:28,013
<i>I never even thought there was
anything wrong about the bondage.</i>

1006
01:03:30,053 --> 01:03:34,523
<i>The only thing I regret in all
of my modeling experience,</i>

1007
01:03:34,524 --> 01:03:38,427
<i>one time three camera
clubs got together.</i>

1008
01:03:38,428 --> 01:03:43,599
<i>And they got me to drinking
blackberry brandy,</i>

1009
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:46,402
<i>it's very tasty, you know.</i>

1010
01:03:46,403 --> 01:03:51,173
<i>And I must have gotten drunk, the
only time in my life I was drunk.</i>

1011
01:03:51,174 --> 01:03:52,975
<i>But I don't remember what happened,</i>

1012
01:03:52,976 --> 01:03:54,677
<i>I remember starting
to pose for them</i>

1013
01:03:54,678 --> 01:03:59,114
<i>in my regular poses
but never open poses.</i>

1014
01:03:59,115 --> 01:04:01,850
<i>And there were four or five shots.</i>

1015
01:04:01,851 --> 01:04:04,386
<i>And I was so disappointed in it.</i>

1016
01:04:04,387 --> 01:04:06,522
<i>That's one of the reasons
I left New York,</i>

1017
01:04:06,523 --> 01:04:10,916
<i>was because of those pornographic
pictures being sold on me.</i>

1018
01:04:14,264 --> 01:04:18,367
<i>I was 34 in 1957,</i>

1019
01:04:18,368 --> 01:04:21,737
<i>and I thought I was
getting too old to model.</i>

1020
01:04:21,738 --> 01:04:24,440
<i>And that there were so many
pictures of me around,</i>

1021
01:04:24,441 --> 01:04:28,143
<i>I thought the photographers
were tired of shooting me.</i>

1022
01:04:28,144 --> 01:04:33,015
<i>And then too I'd had all that unhappy
experience with the Kefauver committee.</i>

1023
01:04:33,016 --> 01:04:36,408
<i>So I just left everything.</i>

1024
01:04:42,392 --> 01:04:45,928
She just disappeared and there
was much mystique about her.

1025
01:04:45,929 --> 01:04:49,264
Nobody knew beyond that,

1026
01:04:49,265 --> 01:04:52,301
that their was a fascinating
story about this woman,

1027
01:04:52,302 --> 01:04:57,206
who reached the peak of popularity
in her profession and disappeared.

1028
01:04:57,207 --> 01:05:00,743
Over my years of research,
I heard a lot of crazy rumors.

1029
01:05:00,744 --> 01:05:04,146
That she was slinging
hash in Texas,

1030
01:05:04,147 --> 01:05:07,383
<i>that she had married Lash LaRue,</i>

1031
01:05:07,384 --> 01:05:10,586
that she had moved to
England and married a duke.

1032
01:05:10,587 --> 01:05:14,723
That the mob had rubbed her out
because of a photo shoot gone bad.

1033
01:05:14,724 --> 01:05:17,626
That she had passed out literature

1034
01:05:17,627 --> 01:05:20,829
in the Chicago O'Hare
airport for Billy Graham.

1035
01:05:20,830 --> 01:05:23,562
That was the only
one that was true.

1036
01:05:24,701 --> 01:05:27,436
The whole Bettie Page phenomenon,

1037
01:05:27,437 --> 01:05:29,204
which is separate
from the human being,

1038
01:05:29,205 --> 01:05:31,240
<i>developed while she was
simply off the scene,</i>

1039
01:05:31,241 --> 01:05:34,610
<i>and she was not really aware of it.</i>

1040
01:05:34,611 --> 01:05:37,246
<i>It still amazes me</i>

1041
01:05:37,247 --> 01:05:39,615
<i>after 40 years,</i>

1042
01:05:39,616 --> 01:05:42,217
<i>as popular as my pictures are now,</i>

1043
01:05:42,218 --> 01:05:44,620
<i>especially with young people.</i>

1044
01:05:44,621 --> 01:05:48,357
<i>Most of the boys say
they learned about me</i>

1045
01:05:48,358 --> 01:05:53,095
<i>from their fathers' girly magazines
that they found in the attic,</i>

1046
01:05:53,096 --> 01:05:57,132
<i>or prowling through their fathers'
dresser drawers and things like that.</i>

1047
01:05:58,802 --> 01:06:03,872
<i>And they claim that I opened
up the sexual revolution.</i>

1048
01:06:05,341 --> 01:06:08,544
<i>The first time that I
ever saw Bettie Page</i>

1049
01:06:08,545 --> 01:06:13,015
in any of this material, I mean,
I immediately recognized her

1050
01:06:13,016 --> 01:06:17,453
<i>as someone that had
the visual power</i>

1051
01:06:17,454 --> 01:06:21,813
<i>to provoke something inside.</i>

1052
01:06:23,526 --> 01:06:26,495
<i>I was thinking that I
was doing something</i>

1053
01:06:26,496 --> 01:06:31,233
<i>that was part of the modernist
movement of painting</i>

1054
01:06:31,234 --> 01:06:35,571
<i>and that was to take
a taboo photograph,</i>

1055
01:06:35,572 --> 01:06:39,074
<i>blow it up bigger than life-size
in a beautiful oil painting,</i>

1056
01:06:39,075 --> 01:06:41,910
<i>and put it in a high-end gallery.</i>

1057
01:06:41,911 --> 01:06:45,514
<i>Bettie Page really set the stage</i>

1058
01:06:45,515 --> 01:06:48,584
<i>for the vogue photographers</i>

1059
01:06:48,585 --> 01:06:52,079
<i>that came in the '70s and the '80s.</i>

1060
01:06:54,124 --> 01:06:56,825
<i>There's never been
anyone like Bettie before.</i>

1061
01:06:56,826 --> 01:06:59,161
Monroe had Harlow and Dietrich,

1062
01:06:59,162 --> 01:07:01,497
she had all those blond bombshells,

1063
01:07:01,498 --> 01:07:04,299
but Bettie, there was
nothing like Bettie.

1064
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:07,569
She's the first icon of her nature.

1065
01:07:07,570 --> 01:07:09,705
<i>And feminism has changed,</i>

1066
01:07:09,706 --> 01:07:12,107
so women are actually
using sexuality

1067
01:07:12,108 --> 01:07:14,610
in a different way, they're
more accepting of it.

1068
01:07:14,611 --> 01:07:16,712
I would paint a few pictures

1069
01:07:16,713 --> 01:07:19,707
and then I would see them
appear in front of me.

1070
01:07:20,884 --> 01:07:23,352
<i>And the girls would start
showing up dressed like her.</i>

1071
01:07:23,353 --> 01:07:24,786
<i>Either they had purple hair,</i>

1072
01:07:24,787 --> 01:07:27,356
but they'd have the Bettie Page
bangs, they'd be tattooed.

1073
01:07:27,357 --> 01:07:31,093
It'd be a form of
Bettie, but different.

1074
01:07:31,094 --> 01:07:33,162
<i>Bettie meant something to them.</i>

1075
01:07:33,163 --> 01:07:38,728
So I kept painting Bettie for them.

1076
01:07:43,139 --> 01:07:45,674
<i>The fetishistic outfits
that she wore,</i>

1077
01:07:45,675 --> 01:07:48,210
<i>I mean, those are dreams to paint.</i>

1078
01:07:48,211 --> 01:07:51,446
<i>You know, the seam
stockings, the garter belts,</i>

1079
01:07:51,447 --> 01:07:55,417
<i>the snub-nosed stilettos,
and that hair.</i>

1080
01:07:55,418 --> 01:07:58,687
<i>It's a lot of fun to
paint those things.</i>

1081
01:07:58,688 --> 01:08:02,925
<i>Her attitude, her eyes, the
steam that rises from them.</i>

1082
01:08:02,926 --> 01:08:04,927
<i>That's the most
important thing to me.</i>

1083
01:08:04,928 --> 01:08:08,964
<i>She makes it accessible that
anybody can be having this fun,</i>

1084
01:08:08,965 --> 01:08:11,333
<i>you're not going to
go to hell for it.</i>

1085
01:08:13,169 --> 01:08:16,805
<i>When AIDS came out
as the huge plague,</i>

1086
01:08:16,806 --> 01:08:21,043
<i>and anybody who had sex could get
it and die this horrible death,</i>

1087
01:08:21,044 --> 01:08:25,380
<i>I think that people really
identify with Bettie as fantasy</i>

1088
01:08:25,381 --> 01:08:28,584
<i>instead of the actual sex act,</i>

1089
01:08:28,585 --> 01:08:32,421
<i>so it was just a
matter of survival.</i>

1090
01:08:33,756 --> 01:08:37,292
<i>I could see that Bettie
was getting more popular</i>

1091
01:08:37,293 --> 01:08:39,595
<i>in so many other directions.</i>

1092
01:08:39,596 --> 01:08:43,432
<i>And Dave Stevens' the
Rocketeer happened.</i>

1093
01:08:43,433 --> 01:08:45,534
I came across a full
page photograph

1094
01:08:45,535 --> 01:08:47,669
of her standing in water

1095
01:08:47,670 --> 01:08:49,838
<i>in a little bikini that she made</i>

1096
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:52,841
<i>and just was knocked out, totally.</i>

1097
01:08:52,842 --> 01:08:57,246
<i>I remember thinking, this has
got to be the most attractive,</i>

1098
01:08:57,247 --> 01:08:59,815
<i>she just exuded health</i>

1099
01:08:59,816 --> 01:09:04,482
<i>and joy and everything else
that's like so appealing.</i>

1100
01:09:16,833 --> 01:09:21,670
Dave's foundation certainly
led to the Betty Pages.

1101
01:09:22,472 --> 01:09:25,707
<i>At the time, nobody had reprinted
a picture of Bettie Page</i>

1102
01:09:25,708 --> 01:09:28,633
<i>in two or three decades.</i>

1103
01:09:29,646 --> 01:09:33,348
<i>The first issue of the Betty
Pages sold out in two weeks.</i>

1104
01:09:33,349 --> 01:09:34,950
<i>But word filtered back immediately.</i>

1105
01:09:34,951 --> 01:09:36,518
<i>Can you do a reprint of this?</i>

1106
01:09:36,519 --> 01:09:40,822
<i>It sold out instantly on the
newsstands, I had no idea.</i>

1107
01:09:40,823 --> 01:09:43,325
<i>And when I say newsstands,
I mean comic book stores,</i>

1108
01:09:43,326 --> 01:09:45,861
<i>that was my only distribution
outlet at the time.</i>

1109
01:09:45,862 --> 01:09:48,430
<i>But there was an audience waiting.</i>

1110
01:09:48,431 --> 01:09:50,766
<i>Thank you, Dave Stevens.</i>

1111
01:09:50,767 --> 01:09:53,601
<i>The readers already
knew who she was.</i>

1112
01:09:54,304 --> 01:09:56,972
<i>Then Bettie really became bigger</i>

1113
01:09:56,973 --> 01:09:59,274
<i>In the fashion world:</i>

1114
01:09:59,275 --> 01:10:01,310
<i>Gaultier, Muggler,</i>

1115
01:10:01,311 --> 01:10:03,412
<i>the S&M world, through Madonna.</i>

1116
01:10:03,413 --> 01:10:05,881
<i>You held me down and
tried to make me break</i>

1117
01:10:05,882 --> 01:10:07,749
<i>Express yourself,
don't repress yourself</i>♪

1118
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:11,153
<i>Did I say something true?</i>

1119
01:10:11,154 --> 01:10:14,556
<i>Oops, I didn't know
I couldn't talk about sex.</i>

1120
01:10:14,557 --> 01:10:16,792
<i>You just couldn't get around her,</i>

1121
01:10:16,793 --> 01:10:19,628
<i>she was a force to
be reckoned with.</i>

1122
01:10:19,629 --> 01:10:23,532
<i>She just became part
of the culture.</i>

1123
01:10:23,533 --> 01:10:26,435
Bob Shultz and I started this club,

1124
01:10:26,436 --> 01:10:29,071
<i>the "Bettie Scouts"...
tongue and cheek title,</i>

1125
01:10:29,072 --> 01:10:32,107
kind of line Boy Scouts of America,
but Bettie Scouts of America...

1126
01:10:32,108 --> 01:10:33,942
'cause we spent a lot of time
going around the country

1127
01:10:33,943 --> 01:10:36,011
scouting for Bettie Page.

1128
01:10:36,012 --> 01:10:37,279
<i>And when we started it,</i>

1129
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:40,046
<i>we did not know if
Bettie was still alive.</i>

1130
01:10:41,684 --> 01:10:44,286
<i>My gut feeling was she had
probably passed away,</i>

1131
01:10:44,287 --> 01:10:47,055
<i>'cause I couldn't understand how
somebody could be under the radar</i>

1132
01:10:47,056 --> 01:10:50,448
<i>that many years, when people
were actively looking for her.</i>

1133
01:10:52,695 --> 01:10:55,831
<i>I got a call from a reporter</i>

1134
01:10:55,832 --> 01:10:58,967
in Nashville, Tennessee
named Thomas Goldsmith.

1135
01:10:58,968 --> 01:11:03,605
<i>I would give him credit
with finding Bettie Page.</i>

1136
01:11:03,606 --> 01:11:06,074
<i>And he said, "Do you
know where Bettie's at?"</i>

1137
01:11:06,075 --> 01:11:08,210
And I said, "No, I'm
just like all the rest

1138
01:11:08,211 --> 01:11:10,245
in the people in the country
trying to figure out

1139
01:11:10,246 --> 01:11:12,247
<i>what happened to Bettie Page."</i>

1140
01:11:12,248 --> 01:11:15,517
<i>He said, "Bettie Page is alive.</i>

1141
01:11:15,518 --> 01:11:17,219
<i>And I'm gonna give you a big clue.</i>

1142
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:21,256
She has a living
brother in Nashville."

1143
01:11:21,257 --> 01:11:23,692
<i>Within minutes, I called Jack Page.</i>

1144
01:11:23,693 --> 01:11:27,429
<i>I said, "If I write
a letter to Bettie,</i>

1145
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:30,298
<i>would you forward it to her?"</i>

1146
01:11:30,299 --> 01:11:33,168
And I wrote the letter,
I believe it was, April...

1147
01:11:33,169 --> 01:11:35,971
April, May, 1992.

1148
01:11:35,972 --> 01:11:39,741
I didn't hear anything
'til December of 1992.

1149
01:11:39,742 --> 01:11:41,076
And I could remember that,

1150
01:11:41,077 --> 01:11:44,146
that was one of the most
excited days of my life.

1151
01:11:44,147 --> 01:11:46,982
I went to the mailbox
and here's a letter,

1152
01:11:46,983 --> 01:11:51,012
<i>and it says in the
corner, "Bettie Page."</i>

1153
01:11:52,121 --> 01:11:54,956
<i>She used to write everything
in this turquoise ink.</i>

1154
01:11:54,957 --> 01:11:56,625
<i>Very identifiable ink.</i>

1155
01:11:56,626 --> 01:11:58,093
<i>It's like her trademark.</i>

1156
01:11:58,094 --> 01:12:01,062
<i>And she was so flattered
to have a fan club,</i>

1157
01:12:01,063 --> 01:12:02,431
<i>she couldn't believe that people</i>

1158
01:12:02,432 --> 01:12:04,566
<i>had any interest in her
after all these years.</i>

1159
01:12:04,567 --> 01:12:08,570
<i>For about a year, we did
this little relay of letters.</i>

1160
01:12:08,571 --> 01:12:12,040
<i>And then finally in August of 1999,</i>

1161
01:12:12,041 --> 01:12:15,243
my wife and I drove
out to California

1162
01:12:15,244 --> 01:12:17,946
and met Bettie face to face.

1163
01:12:17,947 --> 01:12:21,483
<i>We spent a lot of time
talking about the Bible,</i>

1164
01:12:21,484 --> 01:12:23,251
<i>because she loved the Bible.</i>

1165
01:12:23,252 --> 01:12:27,155
<i>And I enjoy reading the Bible too,
so we just had a good old time.</i>

1166
01:12:27,156 --> 01:12:28,957
And then to think, you know,

1167
01:12:28,958 --> 01:12:31,426
here I'm just a guy
collecting old magazines

1168
01:12:31,427 --> 01:12:35,497
and kind of becomes infatuated
with this pinup girl from the '50s,

1169
01:12:35,498 --> 01:12:37,365
<i>and to think that this
could materialize</i>

1170
01:12:37,366 --> 01:12:43,004
<i>to the point that I get to meet her,
her family, her sisters, her brothers.</i>

1171
01:12:43,005 --> 01:12:46,274
<i>Now, did your family know
that you were a pinup model?</i>

1172
01:12:46,275 --> 01:12:48,677
<i>They never said a
word to me about it,</i>

1173
01:12:48,678 --> 01:12:51,379
<i>never commented about it
and nether did my mother.</i>

1174
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:56,651
<i>One time, I was looking in her
closet when she was gone to work,</i>

1175
01:12:56,652 --> 01:12:59,721
<i>and I found a whole big stack</i>

1176
01:12:59,722 --> 01:13:02,491
<i>of Robert Harrison's
pinup magazines,</i>

1177
01:13:02,492 --> 01:13:04,593
<i>with my pictures marked</i>

1178
01:13:04,594 --> 01:13:07,696
<i>and the pages turned down in it.</i>

1179
01:13:07,697 --> 01:13:10,365
<i>Never said a word to me, one
way or another about it,</i>

1180
01:13:10,366 --> 01:13:13,132
<i>never even mentioned it
and I didn't either.</i>

1181
01:13:17,206 --> 01:13:21,576
<i>She was living way out in
the fringes of Los Angeles,</i>

1182
01:13:21,577 --> 01:13:25,413
<i>you went any further, there
was no more humanity.</i>

1183
01:13:25,414 --> 01:13:28,250
<i>And she explained that she'd
had some difficulties</i>

1184
01:13:28,251 --> 01:13:31,586
<i>and that she was on
Social Security.</i>

1185
01:13:32,855 --> 01:13:35,624
<i>Now, when you walked away
from the modeling career,</i>

1186
01:13:35,625 --> 01:13:37,325
<i>you never really looked
back at it, did you?</i>

1187
01:13:37,326 --> 01:13:39,427
<i>I didn't want to be bothered.</i>

1188
01:13:39,428 --> 01:13:43,999
<i>I'd rather be incognito,
like I am nowadays.</i>

1189
01:13:47,169 --> 01:13:50,272
<i>After I left New York,
I went back to Florida,</i>

1190
01:13:50,273 --> 01:13:54,809
<i>and I just wanted to enjoy the
sunshine and do something else.</i>

1191
01:13:54,810 --> 01:13:58,647
<i>I started up with my old
boyfriend Armond Walterson</i>

1192
01:13:58,648 --> 01:14:01,516
<i>that I had dated in 1954</i>

1193
01:14:01,517 --> 01:14:03,919
<i>when I was in Florida
posing for Bunny Yeager.</i>

1194
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:06,621
<i>He was going with Margaret.</i>

1195
01:14:06,622 --> 01:14:08,023
<i>As soon as I called him up</i>

1196
01:14:08,024 --> 01:14:09,958
<i>he dropped Margaret
like a hot potato</i>

1197
01:14:09,959 --> 01:14:12,427
<i>and started dating me.</i>

1198
01:14:12,428 --> 01:14:15,263
<i>Every Saturday night,
we'd go to the drive in</i>

1199
01:14:15,264 --> 01:14:17,632
<i>and we would sit in the
car and make love.</i>

1200
01:14:17,633 --> 01:14:19,668
<i>We didn't watch the
movies half the time.</i>

1201
01:14:21,037 --> 01:14:24,372
<i>When I met him, he didn't
even know how to kiss.</i>

1202
01:14:24,373 --> 01:14:27,442
<i>I taught him everything he knew.</i>

1203
01:14:27,443 --> 01:14:30,645
<i>He learned fast though.</i>

1204
01:14:30,646 --> 01:14:33,348
<i>Two months after the wedding,</i>

1205
01:14:33,349 --> 01:14:36,217
<i>I realized that I made a mistake.</i>

1206
01:14:36,218 --> 01:14:39,454
<i>All we had in common was movies,</i>

1207
01:14:39,455 --> 01:14:42,255
<i>sex, and hamburgers.</i>

1208
01:14:43,492 --> 01:14:45,927
<i>If ever I've been stupid
about anything in my life</i>

1209
01:14:45,928 --> 01:14:49,664
<i>it's where men are
concerned about marriage.</i>

1210
01:14:49,665 --> 01:14:52,534
<i>Here's what broke it all up.</i>

1211
01:14:52,535 --> 01:14:54,736
<i>This was the beginning
of New Year's 1958.</i>

1212
01:14:54,737 --> 01:14:57,639
<i>We got into a big argument</i>

1213
01:14:57,640 --> 01:15:00,375
<i>because he wanted to go and
get drunk with his buddies,</i>

1214
01:15:00,376 --> 01:15:03,578
<i>and I wanted to go dancing like
I'd been in the habit of doing</i>

1215
01:15:03,579 --> 01:15:05,513
<i>on New Year's Eve,</i>

1216
01:15:05,514 --> 01:15:09,918
<i>so he left at about
20 minutes to 12.</i>

1217
01:15:09,919 --> 01:15:12,116
<i>And I went walking
out White Street.</i>

1218
01:15:15,324 --> 01:15:17,659
<i>And I saw a little
church over there,</i>

1219
01:15:17,660 --> 01:15:20,362
<i>and heard music, singing.</i>

1220
01:15:20,363 --> 01:15:24,563
<i>It had a white neon cross
over the top of it.</i>

1221
01:15:26,969 --> 01:15:30,205
<i>And I just had to go, like
somebody had me by the hand,</i>

1222
01:15:30,206 --> 01:15:33,308
<i>I had to cross the street and
go in there, I'm telling you.</i>

1223
01:15:33,309 --> 01:15:37,907
<i>I knew it was the Lord, nobody would
ever convince me it wasn't him.</i>

1224
01:15:38,714 --> 01:15:41,650
<i>I stood back there and
cried about all my sins.</i>

1225
01:15:41,651 --> 01:15:45,954
<i>I thought God disapproved of
me doing nudes, you know.</i>

1226
01:15:45,955 --> 01:15:48,323
<i>I didn't think anything about
the fetish and the bondage</i>

1227
01:15:48,324 --> 01:15:50,125
<i>for Irving, but I had to do that.</i>

1228
01:15:50,126 --> 01:15:53,395
<i>But I thought maybe He looked down
on me for posing in the nude.</i>

1229
01:15:53,396 --> 01:15:56,498
<i>That's what I was telling
the pastor, and he said,</i>

1230
01:15:56,499 --> 01:16:00,101
<i>"Have you ever done anything
as bad as the apostle Paul?"</i>

1231
01:16:00,102 --> 01:16:02,070
<i>I said, "What did he do?"</i>

1232
01:16:02,071 --> 01:16:03,905
<i>I didn't know the Bible.</i>

1233
01:16:03,906 --> 01:16:06,374
<i>He said, "Well, he had
the Christians murdered.</i>

1234
01:16:06,375 --> 01:16:08,343
<i>Have you ever done
anything that bad?"</i>

1235
01:16:08,344 --> 01:16:10,478
<i>I said, "No, of course not."</i>

1236
01:16:10,479 --> 01:16:12,580
<i>He said, "Well, God forgave him</i>

1237
01:16:12,581 --> 01:16:15,016
<i>and made him the greatest
missionary of all time.</i>

1238
01:16:15,017 --> 01:16:19,287
<i>He can certainly forgive you for
posing in the nude, don't you think?"</i>

1239
01:16:19,288 --> 01:16:22,524
<i>And I received the Lord
Jesus as my savior</i>

1240
01:16:22,525 --> 01:16:26,061
<i>and I turned my life
over to the Lord,</i>

1241
01:16:26,062 --> 01:16:30,865
<i>and went to Bible schools
for three years.</i>

1242
01:16:30,866 --> 01:16:32,467
<i>They were very strict, you know.</i>

1243
01:16:32,468 --> 01:16:35,336
<i>I always loved dancing.</i>

1244
01:16:35,337 --> 01:16:37,939
<i>I couldn't even go dancing,
couldn't even go to the movies.</i>

1245
01:16:37,940 --> 01:16:40,141
<i>The only movie I was
allowed to attend</i>

1246
01:16:40,142 --> 01:16:43,841
<i>during those three years
was</i> The Ten Commandments.

1247
01:16:44,814 --> 01:16:46,448
<i>I wanted to be a missionary.</i>

1248
01:16:46,449 --> 01:16:48,183
<i>I thought God wanted
me to be a missionary.</i>

1249
01:16:48,184 --> 01:16:52,053
<i>But you know, when I graduated
and I went to a mission board,</i>

1250
01:16:52,054 --> 01:16:55,990
<i>they would not take me
because I had been divorced.</i>

1251
01:16:55,991 --> 01:16:59,027
<i>To some Christians, especially
the fundamentalists,</i>

1252
01:16:59,028 --> 01:17:03,091
<i>being divorced is worse than
having committed murder!</i>

1253
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:08,069
<i>They got me to believe that I
would be out of the will of God</i>

1254
01:17:08,070 --> 01:17:09,971
<i>if I didn't go back and
lead my first husband</i>

1255
01:17:09,972 --> 01:17:12,707
<i>to the Lord and marry him again.</i>

1256
01:17:12,708 --> 01:17:16,311
<i>Well, I led him to the Lord and he
prayed with me to receive Jesus</i>

1257
01:17:16,312 --> 01:17:18,446
<i>and I thought he was sincere</i>

1258
01:17:18,447 --> 01:17:20,849
<i>and I married him again.</i>

1259
01:17:20,850 --> 01:17:24,085
<i>One month I was in his house.</i>

1260
01:17:24,086 --> 01:17:27,021
<i>The man would not even
have sex with me.</i>

1261
01:17:27,022 --> 01:17:28,690
<i>And I see him, I said,
"What's the matter, Billy?"</i>

1262
01:17:28,691 --> 01:17:31,126
<i>He said, "Well, you're filthy.
You've still got a venereal disease."</i>

1263
01:17:31,127 --> 01:17:33,428
<i>I said, "Where did you ever
hear anything like that?"</i>

1264
01:17:33,429 --> 01:17:35,096
<i>He said, "Everybody knows it."</i>

1265
01:17:35,097 --> 01:17:39,593
<i>I said, "Everybody's a liar, I've never
had a venereal disease in my life."</i>

1266
01:17:40,436 --> 01:17:43,338
<i>Well, do you know, he
grabbed me by the throat,</i>

1267
01:17:43,339 --> 01:17:45,073
<i>I mean, he was choking me.</i>

1268
01:17:45,074 --> 01:17:48,943
<i>I was finally able to get his hands
off enough to scream out loud,</i>

1269
01:17:48,944 --> 01:17:51,880
<i>"Billy, if you kill me, God
will never forgive you!"</i>

1270
01:17:51,881 --> 01:17:55,784
<i>He let go, and he got up
and went in his room.</i>

1271
01:17:55,785 --> 01:17:58,119
<i>The man almost choked me to death.</i>

1272
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:01,689
<i>But that was the worst thing
that ever happened to me.</i>

1273
01:18:01,690 --> 01:18:04,251
<i>I almost lost my life over it.</i>

1274
01:18:06,228 --> 01:18:08,563
<i>I had the thing
annulled right away,</i>

1275
01:18:08,564 --> 01:18:11,831
<i>since it was never
consummated sexually.</i>

1276
01:18:12,935 --> 01:18:15,103
<i>After I spent a year and a half</i>

1277
01:18:15,104 --> 01:18:17,872
<i>working on a masters
degree at Peabody,</i>

1278
01:18:17,873 --> 01:18:22,510
<i>I just lacked four credits
now, getting the masters,</i>

1279
01:18:22,511 --> 01:18:25,280
<i>and I just got tired of studying.</i>

1280
01:18:25,281 --> 01:18:27,415
<i>So I left Nashville.</i>

1281
01:18:27,416 --> 01:18:33,220
<i>I went back to Miami and I
started going dancing again.</i>

1282
01:18:34,924 --> 01:18:38,092
<i>And one night I saw
this handsome fella.</i>

1283
01:18:38,093 --> 01:18:41,596
She didn't look like a model
of any kind, you know.

1284
01:18:41,597 --> 01:18:45,200
She's just a healthy
looking young lady.

1285
01:18:45,201 --> 01:18:47,802
Well, not so young,
she was in her forties,

1286
01:18:47,803 --> 01:18:50,872
<i>but just looked like a nice person.</i>

1287
01:18:50,873 --> 01:18:53,842
So I went out on the floor
and asked her to dance,

1288
01:18:53,843 --> 01:18:56,477
and she says, "Certainly,
I'd love to dance with you."

1289
01:18:56,478 --> 01:19:00,215
<i>So we danced and we danced,
we danced all night.</i>

1290
01:19:00,216 --> 01:19:03,084
She was the most
unpretentious person

1291
01:19:03,085 --> 01:19:04,853
that I have ever met.

1292
01:19:04,854 --> 01:19:09,958
<i>I called her the next day
and we were inseparable.</i>

1293
01:19:09,959 --> 01:19:11,926
<i>He was divorced.</i>

1294
01:19:11,927 --> 01:19:13,528
<i>He says, "I have two
boys and a girl."</i>

1295
01:19:13,529 --> 01:19:16,796
<i>I said, "Two boys and a girl,
that's what I always wanted."</i>

1296
01:19:17,666 --> 01:19:21,369
<i>Well, I couldn't have
children, I tried for years.</i>

1297
01:19:21,370 --> 01:19:25,907
<i>But I was attracted to
Harry from the word "go".</i>

1298
01:19:25,908 --> 01:19:30,111
<i>I just wanted to be with him
and to make love to him.</i>

1299
01:19:30,112 --> 01:19:31,946
<i>I didn't know a thing about her.</i>

1300
01:19:31,947 --> 01:19:34,215
We went out on this pier,

1301
01:19:34,216 --> 01:19:37,785
and I was looking
through the post cards

1302
01:19:37,786 --> 01:19:40,855
<i>and I saw this post card and
I looked at that post card,</i>

1303
01:19:40,856 --> 01:19:43,758
<i>and I looked over at her and
I looked at the card again.</i>

1304
01:19:43,759 --> 01:19:45,493
<i>It was Bettie.</i>

1305
01:19:45,494 --> 01:19:49,397
<i>It says, "Wow! We alligators
have such fun in Florida."</i>

1306
01:19:52,434 --> 01:19:55,336
<i>She told me that she modeled a lot.</i>

1307
01:19:55,337 --> 01:19:58,673
And she told me she
never posed nude.

1308
01:20:00,843 --> 01:20:04,279
<i>It didn't make any
difference to me.</i>

1309
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:06,381
<i>The people on the beach,</i>

1310
01:20:06,382 --> 01:20:08,783
their heads would
turn and follow us,

1311
01:20:08,784 --> 01:20:12,745
not me of course, but they would
follow us walking along the beach.

1312
01:20:13,355 --> 01:20:18,693
<i>We got married on
Valentine's Day 1967</i>

1313
01:20:18,694 --> 01:20:24,432
<i>with his three children as
witnesses to the wedding.</i>

1314
01:20:24,433 --> 01:20:27,435
<i>I had a nice new home for Bettie</i>

1315
01:20:27,436 --> 01:20:32,573
<i>and the children, everything
was set up perfect, you know.</i>

1316
01:20:32,574 --> 01:20:35,476
<i>And then we had an
addition put on the house</i>

1317
01:20:35,477 --> 01:20:37,478
<i>with a cement roof on top,</i>

1318
01:20:37,479 --> 01:20:41,516
<i>and then I had a three foot
wall around the top of it,</i>

1319
01:20:41,517 --> 01:20:44,408
<i>she'd sunbathe in the
nude up there sometimes.</i>

1320
01:20:45,220 --> 01:20:47,255
<i>He was a hard worker.</i>

1321
01:20:47,256 --> 01:20:49,390
<i>Harry was a good
provider, a good lover,</i>

1322
01:20:49,391 --> 01:20:51,960
<i>now, he was one of the best
lovers I ever had in my life.</i>

1323
01:20:51,961 --> 01:20:54,028
<i>And he was very considerate of me,</i>

1324
01:20:54,029 --> 01:20:57,398
<i>always thinking of my
pleasure before his own.</i>

1325
01:20:57,399 --> 01:21:00,935
I'm not anymore, but I
was a very good lover,

1326
01:21:00,936 --> 01:21:02,470
and she was a very good lover.

1327
01:21:02,471 --> 01:21:05,406
<i>We enjoyed thrilling each other.</i>

1328
01:21:05,407 --> 01:21:09,610
<i>Oh, by the way, that leopard
skin robe, you know.</i>

1329
01:21:09,611 --> 01:21:11,913
<i>She still had that.</i>

1330
01:21:11,914 --> 01:21:16,384
<i>And in the morning she'd put it on,
and in the evening she'd put it on.</i>

1331
01:21:16,385 --> 01:21:19,821
<i>It just turned me wild when I saw her
walking around with that thing on.</i>

1332
01:21:22,024 --> 01:21:26,094
<i>Well, the children were just
as sweet and nice to me</i>

1333
01:21:26,095 --> 01:21:29,364
<i>during the months
that I dated Harry.</i>

1334
01:21:29,365 --> 01:21:34,335
<i>But soon as I moved into the
house, everything changed.</i>

1335
01:21:34,336 --> 01:21:35,770
<i>His ex-wife,</i>

1336
01:21:35,771 --> 01:21:38,506
<i>she was so jealous of
me with the children,</i>

1337
01:21:38,507 --> 01:21:42,010
<i>and she called me up at 4:00 in
the morning and cussed me out.</i>

1338
01:21:42,011 --> 01:21:45,380
<i>It was getting on my nerves,
I wasn't getting any sleep,</i>

1339
01:21:45,381 --> 01:21:47,081
<i>and I was very unhappy.</i>

1340
01:21:47,082 --> 01:21:50,284
<i>So I stuck it out for five years.</i>

1341
01:21:50,285 --> 01:21:52,453
<i>I started losing my love for Harry</i>

1342
01:21:52,454 --> 01:21:54,622
<i>when he wouldn't make
those children mind me</i>

1343
01:21:54,623 --> 01:21:56,888
<i>or do anything I asked them to do.</i>

1344
01:21:59,561 --> 01:22:02,163
<i>She wanted to start
going to church again.</i>

1345
01:22:02,164 --> 01:22:05,333
<i>And the whole family
went to church together.</i>

1346
01:22:05,334 --> 01:22:10,705
<i>We went Sunday morning, Sunday
night, Wednesday evening.</i>

1347
01:22:10,706 --> 01:22:15,743
<i>I mean, it got to be like sort
of a fanatic thing, you know.</i>

1348
01:22:15,744 --> 01:22:17,111
I could see it in her eyes.

1349
01:22:17,112 --> 01:22:20,314
We'd go to church and
she'd blast out singing,

1350
01:22:20,315 --> 01:22:24,152
<i>not boisterous or anything
but real loud voice singing.</i>

1351
01:22:24,153 --> 01:22:27,455
Tears came down her cheeks,

1352
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:29,791
and she'd get real emotional.

1353
01:22:29,792 --> 01:22:32,560
<i>She was so obsessed with
things of the Lord.</i>

1354
01:22:32,561 --> 01:22:35,363
Why should I stop her if...

1355
01:22:35,364 --> 01:22:38,066
if she wanted to go and serve God,

1356
01:22:38,067 --> 01:22:41,197
or the Lord, or be a missionary.

1357
01:22:42,971 --> 01:22:48,943
<i>I got divorced on January 17, 1972,</i>

1358
01:22:48,944 --> 01:22:50,845
<i>then I went to Bible Town,</i>

1359
01:22:50,846 --> 01:22:55,083
<i>which is 70 miles up near
Boca Raton, Florida.</i>

1360
01:22:55,084 --> 01:22:58,519
<i>While I was up there,
I started imagining</i>

1361
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:01,823
<i>that I was hearing somebody talking
to me on my tape recorder,</i>

1362
01:23:01,824 --> 01:23:04,992
<i>and I thought I was
really listening</i>

1363
01:23:04,993 --> 01:23:08,096
<i>to God and the angels
and the devil.</i>

1364
01:23:08,097 --> 01:23:10,832
<i>I lost a lot of weight
then, I wasn't eating</i>

1365
01:23:10,833 --> 01:23:14,498
<i>because they were keeping
me awake talking all night.</i>

1366
01:23:16,338 --> 01:23:21,198
<i>It had built up in my mind so
much that my mind snapped.</i>

1367
01:23:22,878 --> 01:23:26,647
<i>She had caused some
kind of a disturbance.</i>

1368
01:23:26,648 --> 01:23:28,649
The police called me

1369
01:23:28,650 --> 01:23:33,654
and asked me if I could
come up and pick her up.

1370
01:23:33,655 --> 01:23:37,625
<i>I put her out there in my,
I think it was my bedroom,</i>

1371
01:23:37,626 --> 01:23:40,495
<i>and I slept on the
couch at the time.</i>

1372
01:23:40,496 --> 01:23:42,663
<i>I thought I owed it to her.</i>

1373
01:23:42,664 --> 01:23:44,899
<i>What would happen if
I kicked her out?</i>

1374
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:49,937
<i>And the state of Florida in no
way is good to mental illness.</i>

1375
01:23:49,938 --> 01:23:53,641
And I tried to get
her going in places

1376
01:23:53,642 --> 01:23:56,077
and they wouldn't bother with her.

1377
01:23:56,078 --> 01:23:59,313
<i>She had lost it, there's
no doubt about it.</i>

1378
01:23:59,314 --> 01:24:02,517
Bettie called us into
the living room,

1379
01:24:02,518 --> 01:24:05,386
<i>me and my son Larry and Brad,</i>

1380
01:24:05,387 --> 01:24:10,458
<i>called us over by this
picture of Jesus Christ,</i>

1381
01:24:10,459 --> 01:24:12,894
with a knife in her hand.

1382
01:24:12,895 --> 01:24:14,962
She said, "If you take
your eyes off him,

1383
01:24:14,963 --> 01:24:18,127
<i>I'm going to cut your guts out."</i>

1384
01:24:20,636 --> 01:24:22,970
Whoa, you know, here I was.

1385
01:24:22,971 --> 01:24:24,906
<i>I could read Bettie pretty good</i>

1386
01:24:24,907 --> 01:24:30,144
<i>and I felt safe that she wasn't
going to do it right then.</i>

1387
01:24:30,145 --> 01:24:32,947
I said, "Bettie, I've got
to go to the bathroom,

1388
01:24:32,948 --> 01:24:35,950
I've got to relieve
myself real bad."

1389
01:24:35,951 --> 01:24:38,853
So I went back into the bedroom,

1390
01:24:38,854 --> 01:24:41,155
<i>picked up the phone,</i>

1391
01:24:41,156 --> 01:24:43,157
<i>called the Hialeah Police.</i>

1392
01:24:43,158 --> 01:24:45,560
<i>I let the cop in the front door.</i>

1393
01:24:45,561 --> 01:24:48,262
<i>Bettie went peacefully,</i>

1394
01:24:48,263 --> 01:24:50,790
<i>with a blank look on her face.</i>

1395
01:24:51,433 --> 01:24:54,602
<i>I ended up having a nervous
breakdown and hearing voices,</i>

1396
01:24:54,603 --> 01:24:57,738
<i>and had to go to the
hospital because of it.</i>

1397
01:24:57,739 --> 01:25:00,575
<i>They took me to Jackson
Memorial Hospital.</i>

1398
01:25:00,576 --> 01:25:04,045
<i>They have on the fifth
floor a psychiatric ward.</i>

1399
01:25:04,046 --> 01:25:06,981
<i>I was just there two months.</i>

1400
01:25:06,982 --> 01:25:10,651
<i>They gave me this
horrible thorazine.</i>

1401
01:25:10,652 --> 01:25:15,256
<i>I felt like I had sparks and
things going in my head,</i>

1402
01:25:15,257 --> 01:25:17,625
<i>and you feel like you're
going to die right after,</i>

1403
01:25:17,626 --> 01:25:20,392
<i>for an hour or two after
you take the thorazine.</i>

1404
01:25:21,964 --> 01:25:25,833
<i>But it knocked the voices
right out of me though.</i>

1405
01:25:25,834 --> 01:25:30,170
<i>She was completely
medicated all the time.</i>

1406
01:25:30,906 --> 01:25:33,407
<i>Now, when she was
getting treatment,</i>

1407
01:25:33,408 --> 01:25:35,901
<i>do you know if they gave
her any shock treatment?</i>

1408
01:25:37,079 --> 01:25:39,504
<i>I think she had two.</i>

1409
01:25:41,450 --> 01:25:48,483
<i>Jimmy, one time he came up to the house
after Bettie was with me awhile.</i>

1410
01:25:49,458 --> 01:25:51,993
He said, "I'm gonna take Bettie
back to California with me,

1411
01:25:51,994 --> 01:25:54,228
we're gonna get a place,
we're gonna live together,

1412
01:25:54,229 --> 01:25:56,597
we're gonna get a
house or something."

1413
01:25:56,598 --> 01:25:59,967
<i>California, it's a
very liberal state,</i>

1414
01:25:59,968 --> 01:26:03,826
<i>and their mental facilities
are the best in the world.</i>

1415
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:08,709
<i>Jimmy and I were close
when we were growing up.</i>

1416
01:26:08,710 --> 01:26:10,711
<i>I didn't have any money hardly.</i>

1417
01:26:10,712 --> 01:26:13,580
<i>I had just enough to get
to California at the time.</i>

1418
01:26:14,950 --> 01:26:18,786
Jimmy was supposed to
meet her in California,

1419
01:26:18,787 --> 01:26:21,422
didn't show up.

1420
01:26:21,423 --> 01:26:24,121
<i>That's why she got in trouble.</i>

1421
01:26:27,629 --> 01:26:31,666
<i>She was trying to get rent
receipts from her landlord.</i>

1422
01:26:31,667 --> 01:26:34,235
<i>She was hearing voices,</i>

1423
01:26:34,236 --> 01:26:37,138
<i>I guess telling her to do
some pretty awful things.</i>

1424
01:26:37,139 --> 01:26:40,908
<i>And she thought it was the
devil speaking to her.</i>

1425
01:26:40,909 --> 01:26:42,343
<i>And she did tell me,</i>

1426
01:26:42,344 --> 01:26:46,213
"I had a knife and I was
upset with my landlady,

1427
01:26:46,214 --> 01:26:48,916
and I wrestled her to the
ground and I straddled her,

1428
01:26:48,917 --> 01:26:51,752
and I told her that I was
going to cut her up."

1429
01:26:51,753 --> 01:26:53,654
The lady did not die.

1430
01:26:53,655 --> 01:26:57,725
<i>The lady got cut pretty
severally on her hand.</i>

1431
01:26:57,726 --> 01:27:00,961
Bleeding, blood everywhere.

1432
01:27:00,962 --> 01:27:02,997
Obvious that the lady
needed stitches.

1433
01:27:02,998 --> 01:27:07,034
<i>She was stabbed like
20 or 30 times.</i>

1434
01:27:07,035 --> 01:27:12,340
<i>She pleaded insanity to this charge
of "attempt to commit murder"</i>

1435
01:27:12,341 --> 01:27:16,108
<i>and this assault so they then
put her away for ten years.</i>

1436
01:27:20,415 --> 01:27:23,984
<i>You talked to the
psychiatrist, I think it was,</i>

1437
01:27:23,985 --> 01:27:26,887
<i>three times a week
for half an hour.</i>

1438
01:27:26,888 --> 01:27:31,826
<i>And you went to groups, mostly
group therapy as they call it.</i>

1439
01:27:31,827 --> 01:27:33,928
<i>You just talked about why</i>

1440
01:27:33,929 --> 01:27:35,996
<i>or what caused you to
have your breakdown,</i>

1441
01:27:35,997 --> 01:27:39,567
<i>and I was put on something
called Novane and Artane.</i>

1442
01:27:39,568 --> 01:27:43,371
She had never hinted about any
of the trouble with the law,

1443
01:27:43,372 --> 01:27:46,507
any of the mental institution
years, any of that.

1444
01:27:46,508 --> 01:27:49,643
<i>I didn't think it was something
anybody would want to hear about.</i>

1445
01:27:49,644 --> 01:27:52,308
<i>And it was not anybody's business.</i>

1446
01:27:53,115 --> 01:27:56,250
<i>A lot of people still look down on you
if you've had a nervous breakdown.</i>

1447
01:27:56,251 --> 01:28:00,143
<i>They still thinking like they did
a hundred years ago about it.</i>

1448
01:28:02,157 --> 01:28:04,291
<i>Bettie's the one
that paid the price,</i>

1449
01:28:04,292 --> 01:28:07,561
<i>spending 9 or 10 years
at Patton State</i>

1450
01:28:07,562 --> 01:28:10,430
<i>in a horrible, horrible situation.</i>

1451
01:28:11,466 --> 01:28:16,103
I learned that she was
paranoid schizophrenic.

1452
01:28:16,104 --> 01:28:19,273
That's an enormous cross to bare.

1453
01:28:19,274 --> 01:28:23,577
And whereas she had her parents

1454
01:28:23,578 --> 01:28:27,314
<i>to thank for her
amazing good looks,</i>

1455
01:28:27,315 --> 01:28:28,649
<i>it was a mixed blessing</i>

1456
01:28:28,650 --> 01:28:31,786
because her parents
were also responsible

1457
01:28:31,787 --> 01:28:35,990
for this genetic predisposition

1458
01:28:35,991 --> 01:28:39,527
towards paranoid schizophrenia,

1459
01:28:39,528 --> 01:28:43,264
<i>plus her mother didn't want her,</i>

1460
01:28:43,265 --> 01:28:47,101
<i>and her father molested her.</i>

1461
01:28:47,102 --> 01:28:51,563
Those are heavy
burdens to deal with.

1462
01:28:55,310 --> 01:28:58,279
<i>She was probably one of the
most strong willed people</i>

1463
01:28:58,280 --> 01:28:59,713
<i>anyone's ever going to meet.</i>

1464
01:28:59,714 --> 01:29:02,850
And she'd admit that
she had fallen down

1465
01:29:02,851 --> 01:29:05,519
but she was going to renew,

1466
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:08,355
with great enthusiasm and optimism

1467
01:29:08,356 --> 01:29:10,458
<i>that this time she
would get it right.</i>

1468
01:29:10,459 --> 01:29:15,296
I told her that anytime
there's anything she needs,

1469
01:29:15,297 --> 01:29:17,331
that there are thousands of people

1470
01:29:17,332 --> 01:29:20,301
who would just do anything for
her if they had the chance.

1471
01:29:20,302 --> 01:29:24,638
<i>The one who really did the
most for her was Dave Stevens,</i>

1472
01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:27,274
<i>to the point of she would
call him to go out</i>

1473
01:29:27,275 --> 01:29:30,411
<i>and bring her food or
take her to the doctor.</i>

1474
01:29:30,412 --> 01:29:32,947
<i>I took her into Tower Records</i>

1475
01:29:32,948 --> 01:29:36,050
<i>and I steered her around
to the book section,</i>

1476
01:29:36,051 --> 01:29:39,253
<i>and there on an end cap
of an aisle of books</i>

1477
01:29:39,254 --> 01:29:42,590
<i>was a display of nothing
but Bettie Page books,</i>

1478
01:29:42,591 --> 01:29:45,659
<i>and she just stood
there in amazement.</i>

1479
01:29:45,660 --> 01:29:48,162
<i>She gets so tickled when
she sees some new book</i>

1480
01:29:48,163 --> 01:29:52,700
with her picture on it or some...
whatever product it is,

1481
01:29:52,701 --> 01:29:55,269
even if she's not getting
any money for it.

1482
01:29:55,270 --> 01:30:00,374
<i>Dave knew that Bettie had
been Miss January 1955,</i>

1483
01:30:00,375 --> 01:30:03,143
<i>and he knew that Hef had
never met Bettie Page</i>

1484
01:30:03,144 --> 01:30:05,479
<i>and suggested that they meet.</i>

1485
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:08,816
<i>And he invited me to
dinner at his home,</i>

1486
01:30:08,817 --> 01:30:11,352
<i>the most beautiful home I've
ever been in in my life.</i>

1487
01:30:11,353 --> 01:30:14,455
<i>Looks like a big castle
up in Beverly Hills.</i>

1488
01:30:14,456 --> 01:30:16,790
So usually at the Playboy Mansion,

1489
01:30:16,791 --> 01:30:19,293
everyone has cameras,
everything is being recorded.

1490
01:30:19,294 --> 01:30:22,263
But on this night, because
of Bettie being so private,

1491
01:30:22,264 --> 01:30:25,098
so discreet, no cameras.

1492
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:27,234
<i>I liked Mr. Hefner.</i>

1493
01:30:27,235 --> 01:30:29,670
<i>He was a very nice,
down to earth fella.</i>

1494
01:30:29,671 --> 01:30:32,840
<i>And he greeted us,
Dave Stevens and I,</i>

1495
01:30:32,841 --> 01:30:36,577
<i>in his pajamas, now,
a smoking jacket</i>

1496
01:30:36,578 --> 01:30:40,948
<i>and his purple, satin pajamas.</i>

1497
01:30:40,949 --> 01:30:44,852
And Hef had arranged for a loan of
a 35mm print of "The Rocketeer",

1498
01:30:44,853 --> 01:30:49,223
which was Dave Stevens'
creation, from Disney.

1499
01:30:49,224 --> 01:30:51,525
And Bettie had never seen the film.

1500
01:30:51,526 --> 01:30:54,662
She wanted to see this
film that was an homage

1501
01:30:54,663 --> 01:30:56,263
to her, inspired by her.

1502
01:30:56,264 --> 01:30:59,333
<i>You're a sweet little headache</i>

1503
01:30:59,334 --> 01:31:03,003
<i>But you are lots of fun</i>

1504
01:31:03,004 --> 01:31:05,205
<i>I've a good mind to spank you...</i>

1505
01:31:05,206 --> 01:31:07,107
There was an unauthorized film

1506
01:31:07,108 --> 01:31:12,813
made in 2005 called "The
Notorious Bettie Page".

1507
01:31:12,814 --> 01:31:14,214
This is quite an elegant knot,

1508
01:31:14,215 --> 01:31:17,550
because the more the subject pulls
the tighter the knot becomes.

1509
01:31:18,987 --> 01:31:22,923
She didn't like the word
"Notorious" in the title.

1510
01:31:22,924 --> 01:31:25,826
And do you approve?

1511
01:31:25,827 --> 01:31:28,092
I believe in Jesus.

1512
01:31:29,030 --> 01:31:31,830
Well, of course you do, my dear.

1513
01:31:35,737 --> 01:31:38,071
Of course you do.

1514
01:31:39,674 --> 01:31:41,508
<i>But all of a sudden,
here's what you heard</i>

1515
01:31:41,509 --> 01:31:43,577
from the back of the
screening room.

1516
01:31:43,578 --> 01:31:47,448
"Lies, lies, lies!

1517
01:31:47,449 --> 01:31:51,218
L-I-E-S, lies!

1518
01:31:51,219 --> 01:31:54,782
Why don't you tell the truth?"

1519
01:31:56,992 --> 01:31:59,693
<i>When she resurfaced
here in California,</i>

1520
01:31:59,694 --> 01:32:03,530
<i>she was not being properly
represented by anybody,</i>

1521
01:32:03,531 --> 01:32:07,334
and a lot of people were exploiting
her and taking advantage of her.

1522
01:32:07,335 --> 01:32:13,240
And I was able to put her in the hands
of more appropriate business people,

1523
01:32:13,241 --> 01:32:15,009
legal people,

1524
01:32:15,010 --> 01:32:17,144
so that she had the right
kind of representation

1525
01:32:17,145 --> 01:32:19,947
and somebody to look after
her and take care of her.

1526
01:32:19,948 --> 01:32:22,216
And we've been very
close ever since.

1527
01:32:22,217 --> 01:32:25,719
And I had a call from
Mr. Hefner, who asked me

1528
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:27,521
if I would help out a friend of his

1529
01:32:27,522 --> 01:32:30,324
<i>and try to see that
anything that was done</i>

1530
01:32:30,325 --> 01:32:31,959
<i>with Bettie's name and likeness</i>

1531
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:34,361
<i>ultimately had her approval on it</i>

1532
01:32:34,362 --> 01:32:38,132
<i>and of course she would receive
some type of compensation for it.</i>

1533
01:32:38,133 --> 01:32:40,701
<i>I made more money in
very recent years</i>

1534
01:32:40,702 --> 01:32:44,605
<i>than I ever made during the seven years
I was modeling back in the '50s.</i>

1535
01:32:44,606 --> 01:32:47,775
Bettie was able to enjoy life more

1536
01:32:47,776 --> 01:32:51,512
because of what she could do
in the later part of her life.

1537
01:32:59,220 --> 01:33:01,355
I think she had an
incredible charm.

1538
01:33:01,356 --> 01:33:04,558
She had an incredible aura,
or how you say it, charisma.

1539
01:33:04,559 --> 01:33:07,594
And I think a lot of
models learned from her.

1540
01:33:07,595 --> 01:33:10,097
There's nothing
intimidating about Bettie.

1541
01:33:10,098 --> 01:33:12,132
Women can appreciate her,
men can appreciate her.

1542
01:33:12,133 --> 01:33:15,769
Most of them, you don't really
remember the the person,

1543
01:33:15,770 --> 01:33:18,806
<i>but her, you know, you say,
"Oh yeah, that's Bettie Page."</i>

1544
01:33:18,807 --> 01:33:21,642
She's also has had the
keen sense of timing

1545
01:33:21,643 --> 01:33:25,376
to know exactly when not
to appear, which is hard.

1546
01:33:26,181 --> 01:33:27,347
Go ahead, Bettie.

1547
01:33:27,348 --> 01:33:29,483
<i>Hello every one of you.</i>

1548
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:32,820
Hi, Bettie.

1549
01:33:32,821 --> 01:33:34,455
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

1550
01:33:34,456 --> 01:33:36,824
<i>Gee, sounds like a big mob.</i>

1551
01:33:36,825 --> 01:33:38,225
<i>It is a big mob.</i>

1552
01:33:38,226 --> 01:33:42,096
<i>Bettie, you have thrown the coolest
opening in SoHo that I've seen.</i>

1553
01:33:42,097 --> 01:33:45,899
<i>I hope you like my book,
I'm very pleased with it.</i>

1554
01:33:45,900 --> 01:33:50,104
<i>And we're just all super fans of
yours, and we all wanted to say</i>

1555
01:33:50,105 --> 01:33:52,940
<i>congratulations, and three
cheers to Bettie Page.</i>

1556
01:33:58,279 --> 01:34:01,148
When I realized it was really big

1557
01:34:01,149 --> 01:34:06,520
is when I got the first Bettie Scouts
of America fan letter from China.

1558
01:34:06,521 --> 01:34:09,256
<i>I mean, it's literally
all over the world.</i>

1559
01:34:09,257 --> 01:34:11,425
New Zealand, Australia,
all over Europe.

1560
01:34:11,426 --> 01:34:14,128
<i>She's very very popular in Japan.</i>

1561
01:34:14,129 --> 01:34:15,863
<i>Very popular in England,</i>

1562
01:34:15,864 --> 01:34:17,822
<i>France and Germany.</i>

1563
01:34:23,238 --> 01:34:26,440
<i>Always I had been
inspired by Bettie Page,</i>

1564
01:34:26,441 --> 01:34:30,844
and then the pinups from the
'50s and Bettie is the one,

1565
01:34:30,845 --> 01:34:33,247
the most extreme and
most special one.

1566
01:34:33,248 --> 01:34:36,169
<i>Bettie Page was way
ahead of her time...</i>

1567
01:34:52,133 --> 01:34:55,969
<i>She influenced
[Theiry mugler, gauliter].</i>

1568
01:34:55,970 --> 01:34:57,905
<i>I mean, she did it with humor,</i>

1569
01:34:57,906 --> 01:35:00,841
<i>and I'll always work on my
design in lingerie with humor.</i>

1570
01:35:00,842 --> 01:35:02,476
<i>I mean, it has to be sexy,</i>

1571
01:35:02,477 --> 01:35:05,675
<i>but it must have a
small part of humor.</i>

1572
01:35:06,714 --> 01:35:09,950
<i>Bettie Page can be
an example for women</i>

1573
01:35:09,951 --> 01:35:15,721
<i>to be beautiful, fun, sexy,
and why not, intelligent.</i>

1574
01:35:16,791 --> 01:35:19,393
Lisa, we got another
postcard from your father.

1575
01:35:19,394 --> 01:35:21,662
Wish you were her.

1576
01:35:21,663 --> 01:35:23,597
<i>How many of these things
is he going to send me?</i>

1577
01:35:23,598 --> 01:35:26,533
<i>Why don't you love me?</i>

1578
01:35:26,534 --> 01:35:28,902
<i>Tell me baby why don't you love me</i>

1579
01:35:28,903 --> 01:35:33,501
<i>When I make me so
damn easy to love.</i>

1580
01:35:35,109 --> 01:35:36,910
<i>You know, when I
started seeing girls,</i>

1581
01:35:36,911 --> 01:35:39,513
teenage, twenty, young girls,

1582
01:35:39,514 --> 01:35:42,508
with Bettie tattoos,
I could not believe it.

1583
01:35:43,051 --> 01:35:45,619
<i>And why don't you need me?</i>

1584
01:35:45,620 --> 01:35:48,188
<i>They're looking at
her as a role model,</i>

1585
01:35:48,189 --> 01:35:52,292
as this symbol of
joyous sexual freedom.

1586
01:35:52,293 --> 01:35:54,862
<i>Tell me, baby,
why don't you love me</i>

1587
01:35:54,863 --> 01:35:58,528
<i>When I make me so
damn easy to love?</i>

1588
01:36:02,704 --> 01:36:04,004
<i>It's a tribute to her.</i>

1589
01:36:04,005 --> 01:36:06,573
<i>These heartbreaking good looks,</i>

1590
01:36:06,574 --> 01:36:09,977
<i>the riveting appeal
of her personality,</i>

1591
01:36:09,978 --> 01:36:13,547
<i>still to this day inspires
the kind of response</i>

1592
01:36:13,548 --> 01:36:16,450
<i>that you get from artists,</i>

1593
01:36:16,451 --> 01:36:19,553
fashion designers,

1594
01:36:19,554 --> 01:36:23,014
and the fandom, which
we know is incredible.

1595
01:36:23,791 --> 01:36:27,027
The Bettie Page they
love is very real.

1596
01:36:27,028 --> 01:36:32,132
In other words, I think that she
had this kind of amoral attitude

1597
01:36:32,133 --> 01:36:36,570
<i>towards sexuality and nudity, and
even, you know, the bondage things.</i>

1598
01:36:36,571 --> 01:36:42,075
She did not disgrace those
who looked more sternly

1599
01:36:42,076 --> 01:36:46,246
upon portraits of sexuality.

1600
01:36:46,247 --> 01:36:51,482
I think she handled her
phases of life with dignity.

1601
01:36:52,220 --> 01:36:56,990
The suggestion back then that
sex was simply a natural,

1602
01:36:56,991 --> 01:37:01,428
normal part of life was
very revolutionary,

1603
01:37:01,429 --> 01:37:08,496
and helped to change the
values of our time.

1604
01:37:09,103 --> 01:37:13,200
<i>I think that in that context
Bettie Page is truly iconic.</i>

1605
01:37:15,944 --> 01:37:18,545
<i>If you think the images are
wonderful, you have no idea.</i>

1606
01:37:18,546 --> 01:37:21,114
<i>She's a wonderful human being.</i>

1607
01:37:21,115 --> 01:37:25,052
<i>I never thought of myself as
anything special or important.</i>

1608
01:37:25,053 --> 01:37:28,455
<i>I was just doing my job and
enjoyed ever bit of it.</i>

1609
01:37:30,425 --> 01:37:34,594
<i>And I'm so thankful that
you like my pictures</i>

1610
01:37:34,595 --> 01:37:38,298
<i>and that you care as
much as you do about me,</i>

1611
01:37:38,299 --> 01:37:42,999
<i>and I wish you all the
best, every one of you.</i>

1612
01:38:04,525 --> 01:38:07,995
<i>Well I've seen her face,
in a magazine</i>

1613
01:38:07,996 --> 01:38:09,696
<i>She was looking real cute</i>

1614
01:38:09,697 --> 01:38:11,465
<i>Yea, without her jeans</i>

1615
01:38:11,466 --> 01:38:13,166
<i>She was staring back at me</i>

1616
01:38:13,167 --> 01:38:14,601
<i>With those cunning bad eyes</i>

1617
01:38:14,602 --> 01:38:17,904
<i>I got so turned on,
it was hard to disguise</i>

1618
01:38:17,905 --> 01:38:21,441
<i>The 21 st Century Bettie Page</i>

1619
01:38:21,442 --> 01:38:24,544
<i>The 21 st Century Bettie Page</i>

1620
01:38:24,545 --> 01:38:27,814
<i>Well she's got a different
look, it's from another page</i>

1621
01:38:27,815 --> 01:38:32,117
<i>She's a 21st Century Bettie Page</i>

1622
01:38:37,725 --> 01:38:41,261
<i>Well, I found her name
from a mixed flat mate...</i>

1623
01:38:41,262 --> 01:38:43,797
I am a huge fan, I love her.

1624
01:38:43,798 --> 01:38:45,966
<i>We are the daughters
of Bettie Page.</i>

1625
01:38:45,967 --> 01:38:48,335
There's a little
Bettie in all of us.

1626
01:38:48,336 --> 01:38:50,504
Everyone has a dark side to them

1627
01:38:50,505 --> 01:38:53,807
and she just showed her dark
side the best way possible.

1628
01:38:53,808 --> 01:39:00,044
Wild, strong, liberated,
yet extremely sexy woman.

1629
01:39:00,915 --> 01:39:02,783
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Bettie?

1630
01:39:02,784 --> 01:39:04,284
<i>Yes?</i>

1631
01:39:04,285 --> 01:39:07,721
It's been so many years.
This is Paula Klaw, how are you?

1632
01:39:07,722 --> 01:39:10,852
<i>Very good. Gee, you
sound like a young girl.</i>

1633
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:17,164
<i>I like my privacy these days, I don't
even give out interviews at all.</i>

1634
01:39:17,165 --> 01:39:19,733
Yeah, I know. Good for you.

1635
01:39:19,734 --> 01:39:21,435
<i>So what's your biggest seller now?</i>

1636
01:39:21,436 --> 01:39:22,803
Bettie Page.

1637
01:39:22,804 --> 01:39:24,538
<i>You're kidding,
I don't believe you.</i>

1638
01:39:24,539 --> 01:39:29,042
Do believe me. Everybody
wants your pictures, Bettie.

1639
01:39:29,043 --> 01:39:33,747
<i>I know, I can't get
over the popularity.</i>

1640
01:39:33,748 --> 01:39:36,783
Well, I'm sure you must have
been doing something right.

1641
01:39:38,186 --> 01:39:41,021
<i>I don't know, it amazes
me, I'm telling you.</i>

1642
01:39:41,022 --> 01:39:42,722
<i>I don't understand it at all.</i>

1643
01:39:42,723 --> 01:39:48,128
Well, what a delight to talk
to you after so many years.

1644
01:39:48,129 --> 01:39:49,696
<i>Okay.</i>

1645
01:39:49,697 --> 01:39:51,465
- Okay.
- <i>All right.</i>

1646
01:39:51,466 --> 01:39:53,667
Okay, sweetheart, it was
a delight talking to you.

1647
01:39:53,668 --> 01:39:54,968
<i>Same here, Paula.</i>

1648
01:39:54,969 --> 01:39:56,736
Okay, love you, sweetheart.

1649
01:39:56,737 --> 01:39:57,838
<i>You too.</i>

1650
01:39:57,839 --> 01:40:00,040
<i>And I think of you
fondly and Irving too.</i>

1651
01:40:00,041 --> 01:40:01,475
Thank you, darling.

1652
01:40:01,476 --> 01:40:04,144
- <i>Bye bye.</i>
- Bye bye.

1653
01:40:04,145 --> 01:40:06,980
I didn't hardly
recognize her voice,

1654
01:40:06,981 --> 01:40:08,782
it's even so much deeper.

1655
01:40:08,783 --> 01:40:12,085
I guess in the years
your voice changes,

1656
01:40:12,086 --> 01:40:15,722
'cause she's got like a
hoarseness to her voice.

1657
01:40:15,723 --> 01:40:18,158
But the same Bettie.

1658
01:40:18,159 --> 01:40:20,760
Love her, she sounds so great.

1659
01:40:21,929 --> 01:40:23,597
<i>Oh Betty</i>

1660
01:40:23,598 --> 01:40:27,134
<i>Sweet and fun and kind of saucy</i>

1661
01:40:27,135 --> 01:40:31,338
<i>You can be a little bossy</i>

1662
01:40:31,339 --> 01:40:33,140
<i>But I don't care</i>

1663
01:40:33,141 --> 01:40:36,676
<i>Just wink at me in your underwear</i>

1664
01:40:36,677 --> 01:40:38,478
<i>Oh Betty</i>

1665
01:40:38,479 --> 01:40:42,182
<i>The world is not quite ready</i>

1666
01:40:42,183 --> 01:40:45,819
<i>For you and your satin teddy</i>

1667
01:40:45,820 --> 01:40:47,787
<i>But you're a star</i>

1668
01:40:47,788 --> 01:40:51,458
<i>And I will take you
just the way you are</i>

1669
01:40:51,459 --> 01:40:54,661
<i>Betty, in color or black and white</i>

1670
01:40:54,662 --> 01:40:56,630
<i>On a bear skin rug</i>

1671
01:40:56,631 --> 01:40:58,632
<i>Or dressed up tight</i>

1672
01:40:58,633 --> 01:41:02,035
<i>Betty, with a smile so sweet</i>

1673
01:41:02,036 --> 01:41:03,637
<i>It just melts my heart</i>

1674
01:41:03,638 --> 01:41:05,872
<i>Maybe some day we'll meet</i>

1675
01:41:05,873 --> 01:41:09,643
<i>Maybe some day we'll meet</i>

1676
01:41:09,644 --> 01:41:12,879
<i>Betty, can you stay the night?</i>

1677
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:15,048
<i>Don't have to ask your mother</i>

1678
01:41:15,049 --> 01:41:16,917
<i>If it will be all right</i>

1679
01:41:16,918 --> 01:41:19,878
<i>Betty, please say you might</i>

1680
01:41:20,588 --> 01:41:25,687
<i>Betty, please say you might.</i>
