1
00:00:58,292 --> 00:01:00,958
You sure you want to stay
on the other side of the wall.

2
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,917
They begin demolition on it
next Monday.

3
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:06,958
By the end of this month they'll be
opening a police station and schools.

4
00:01:07,292 --> 00:01:09,833
What's with the long face
you don't seem too happy.

5
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,833
I just hope they keep their promises.

6
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:15,958
Listen, it's the law and the law
is always looking to some fool like me...

7
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:18,667
...to make sure these
matters are handled.

8
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:24,167
Three years later,
the government has changed.

9
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:27,167
...but nothing else has...

10
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:42,833
District 13 Ultimatum

11
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,792
Halt!

12
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,958
Stop!

13
00:04:57,042 --> 00:04:59,750
Follow! Follow!

14
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,792
There he is!

15
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:49,208
What's going on?

16
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,333
Over here.

17
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,750
Hey, man. Now you bringing cops?

18
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:02,625
Sorry.

19
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,208
Think you're a Musketeer
or something?

20
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,417
- Yes, I'm Dartagnan.
- You mocking me?

21
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,167
Dudu, leave it alone.

22
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,667
Dudu, you're a bit dense.
You should have stayed in school.

23
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,833
- Say, you look like a kid.
- I am a kid.

24
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,875
You, take care of the others.
You come with me.

25
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:43,750
Have a seat.
What did you do now?

26
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,667
- This city is not a hotel.
- I'm sorry.

27
00:06:47,792 --> 00:06:50,833
- I'm tired of it.
- This isn't the same situation

28
00:06:51,917 --> 00:06:54,667
You're free, you have the whole
city to yourself.

29
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,125
They treat us like beasts.

30
00:06:58,208 --> 00:06:59,958
It's like this from birth.

31
00:07:00,042 --> 00:07:01,958
For three years they've been telling
us the same thing.

32
00:07:02,042 --> 00:07:05,375
A government that doesn't keep it's
promises? Wow, that's rare.

33
00:07:07,792 --> 00:07:09,875
If we do not do something,
they'll just keep ignoring us.

34
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,625
They keep us trapped here like animals in cages.

35
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:19,792
This isn't your culture dude.
This wall protects us...

36
00:07:19,917 --> 00:07:22,000
...like a fortress.

37
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:25,833
And those that come
with talk of society, are no matter to us.

38
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,875
We have our own.

39
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,917
And we like it that way.

40
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,792
And frankly, I prefer to be the king
of a small kingdom...

41
00:07:32,917 --> 00:07:34,958
...than some nobody out there.

42
00:07:35,042 --> 00:07:37,125
So be cool and stop bringing the cops
to our wall...

43
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,875
...if not, I'll be forced to take
action against you.

44
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,833
Understand me?

45
00:07:43,042 --> 00:07:44,750
This is the merchandise.

46
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:01,917
Takes this.
It's a gift.

47
00:08:08,917 --> 00:08:10,625
Yes, boss?

48
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,458
Yes, boss.

49
00:08:15,167 --> 00:08:16,375
Go in.

50
00:08:21,917 --> 00:08:24,000
Leave it!

51
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,917
Let's go!

52
00:09:06,042 --> 00:09:08,125
Let's go!

53
00:10:07,917 --> 00:10:10,708
Your merchandise has arrived.
Should I go get the first client?

54
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:13,708
Don't be rude, let me enjoy myself
a while.

55
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:16,500
Get them all out, except that one.

56
00:10:19,917 --> 00:10:21,875
Everyone out!

57
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:23,458
Not you.

58
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:27,458
Go see the boss.

59
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:30,167
C'mon, dance a bit!

60
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:46,625
Mr. Ou will see you in a moment.

61
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:49,000
Tell him my ass is falling asleep
from having to wait so long.

62
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,917
You can tell him yourself, sir.

63
00:10:53,792 --> 00:10:55,500
C'mon get on your knees.

64
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:58,500
If you want to win more,
you have to lean more.

65
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:05,583
Get on your knees man.
Hands on top of your head.

66
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,042
- You're a thief?
- Worse.

67
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:08,667
Police.

68
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,417
You're under arrest, you have
the right to maintain your silence...

69
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,667
...until you are in front of the judge.

70
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,458
If you think I'm going to...

71
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,958
In French this means - shut up.

72
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:31,583
No! it's a vase from the Ming
dynasty.

73
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,583
Don't worry, it's a fake.

74
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,167
And the rest?
They're all fake?

75
00:11:40,792 --> 00:11:42,208
Almost. Except for the Van Gogh.

76
00:11:45,917 --> 00:11:50,542
Head office, I have the soap.
I repeat, I have the soap.

77
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:52,708
Understood.
Transmitting location.

78
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:58,708
- I am the soap?
- More like a shampoo.

79
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,750
- Bait is more like it.
- What do you mean bait?

80
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,667
Don't worry.
You don't have to understand.

81
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,583
Everything's calm.
Sanitary control.

82
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:20,458
We'd like to see the boss.

83
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,875
Sir, there is a police unit
at the door.

84
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,167
Two police and I'm sure
there are more hidden.

85
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,708
You're right there. Go.

86
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,292
Go.

87
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:47,667
- Asshole!
- See, they're already biting.

88
00:12:47,792 --> 00:12:50,708
You'll never get out, this building
is completely monitored.

89
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:53,000
If it had been an easy assignment,
they wouldn't have sent me.

90
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,583
What is this?

91
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,667
It's simple, if you speak
your cheeks explode.

92
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,708
Want to test?
Good.

93
00:12:58,792 --> 00:13:01,667
I'll be sure to say how cooperative you
were in my report.

94
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,167
Central, I'm going fishing.

95
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:20,708
Mr. Ou is expecting them.

96
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:29,958
They stay.

97
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,875
Remain here, it's cool.

98
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,458
Mr. Ou, what a pleasure.

99
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:42,583
Don't move.
Over there.

100
00:13:42,917 --> 00:13:44,708
Walk.

101
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:00,208
After you, gentlemen.

102
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:06,292
So I'm last or what?

103
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,292
Them first.

104
00:14:16,667 --> 00:14:18,583
- Hugo.
- You Know me?

105
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:20,750
Yes, I have photos of you all over my rooms.

106
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:21,958
Shit!

107
00:14:22,042 --> 00:14:23,667
Go.

108
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,750
Raise your head.

109
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,625
- What is this?
- You should know, you invented it.

110
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,542
Gentlemen, follow me.

111
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,750
He's fucking with me.

112
00:14:44,042 --> 00:14:46,250
Leave it alone, it's cool.

113
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,958
It's been a week... this fat...

114
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:53,375
Calm down.
Drink a margarita, it'll relax you.

115
00:14:57,792 --> 00:15:00,167
To hell with your margarita!

116
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,750
I'm sick of these guys.

117
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:05,375
C'mon, he's beginning to get antsy.

118
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:16,333
Mr. Sam, Fair went to look for it.

119
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:22,625
This is how you treat
your best client?

120
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,208
Since when do I come last?

121
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,042
We always leave the shit for last.

122
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,750
Hands up.

123
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,500
What are you doing?

124
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,833
This fucker's crazy.

125
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,708
What's this shit?

126
00:15:45,792 --> 00:15:47,542
It doesn't do anything to you?

127
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:52,458
I'm immune asshole.

128
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,542
Well, we'll fix that.

129
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:06,583
It's nothing, a vase fell,
that's all.

130
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:13,417
Central, fishing expedition finished.
Send in the boys.

131
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,208
Already did.

132
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,417
- Nobody move!
- Everyone face down, now!

133
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,667
Hands on your head!

134
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,875
- Go, go!
- Move in!

135
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,375
Go!

136
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,708
You'll never get out alive,
disgusting policeman.

137
00:16:59,042 --> 00:17:00,625
You have no chance!

138
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,458
You're sure?

139
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,542
Let me go! Let me go!

140
00:17:09,917 --> 00:17:12,750
- I'm assuming you're not going to give me the code.
- Go to hell!

141
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,958
Doesn't matter, I have a key.

142
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,292
Drive!

143
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,542
Sending them down now.

144
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,208
Send in the rest of the unit.

145
00:17:54,667 --> 00:17:56,333
Careful with the feet!

146
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,500
Move!

147
00:18:14,792 --> 00:18:16,458
Let him go!

148
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,083
Get out! Shit, get out!

149
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,292
Found it!

150
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:28,500
I told them there were traps.

151
00:18:39,542 --> 00:18:42,333
What happened?
I'll kill you.

152
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,000
Open up!

153
00:19:06,792 --> 00:19:08,417
Shit.

154
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,375
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'll be right with you.

155
00:19:21,792 --> 00:19:23,292
Don't move.

156
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:28,292
This painting is worth
200 million Euros.

157
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,292
It's a Van Gogh.

158
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:33,500
One stray bullet, one scratch,
and it's worthless.

159
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,000
Die motherfucker!

160
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,750
There he is, shoot that fucker!

161
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,917
Ok I see the keypad.

162
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,083
And you guys are...?

163
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:26,833
Lovely to meet you.

164
00:22:34,542 --> 00:22:36,667
Head office, there is a bomb.

165
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:39,583
- A bomb?
- Any ideas?

166
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:56,208
- Where is it exactly?
- In the basement kitchen.

167
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:59,167
Ok,
we'll send you the necessary.

168
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:17,083
Careful!

169
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:19,292
It's on it's way.

170
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:21,000
Fantastic!

171
00:24:04,417 --> 00:24:07,083
Lovely to see you guys.
Come on in.

172
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,417
- Any injuries?
- No, I think it's okay.

173
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,208
- I was referring to you Damian.
- I'm fine commander, thanks.

174
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:23,375
These guys aren't the only ones.

175
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:25,458
Go rest,
file the report tomorrow.

176
00:24:25,542 --> 00:24:28,208
I prefer to keep working while
it's fresh in my head.

177
00:24:28,292 --> 00:24:30,458
Tomorrow I'll go in early
if it's no problem.

178
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:33,292
No, I'll see you in my office
at noon. It's an order.

179
00:24:34,292 --> 00:24:35,250
Thanks.

180
00:24:41,292 --> 00:24:43,000
- Good Work.
- Thanks.

181
00:25:18,292 --> 00:25:19,875
Everything okay.

182
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:25,250
All clear.

183
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:27,000
Send him in.

184
00:25:35,542 --> 00:25:37,042
Gentlemen.

185
00:25:49,292 --> 00:25:52,083
- What do you think of this site?
- Glorious.

186
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:55,875
How long does it take to erect a tower like this?

187
00:25:56,417 --> 00:25:58,958
It depends on the start date.

188
00:25:59,292 --> 00:26:01,458
But more or less,
eight years.

189
00:26:04,208 --> 00:26:05,375
OK.

190
00:26:06,417 --> 00:26:07,625
Yes.

191
00:26:08,417 --> 00:26:09,917
Bring it out.

192
00:26:18,292 --> 00:26:20,375
Just like Chantier...

193
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:23,375
...double, if they give us
the guarantee that they will build it.

194
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,417
The operation will begin
tonight.

195
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,000
Perfect.

196
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:51,167
- Thanks, have a good night.
- Good night, Damien.

197
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:57,667
Shit.

198
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,042
Damien?

199
00:27:41,583 --> 00:27:43,292
Forgot about me?

200
00:27:43,792 --> 00:27:44,792
No.

201
00:27:45,458 --> 00:27:47,792
Just wanted to let you sleep

202
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:52,750
I've been sleeping for eight hours, I'm well rested.

203
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:57,000
Wait, wait.
Take it easy, easy.

204
00:27:57,125 --> 00:27:59,292
My body hurts all over.

205
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:01,625
All over?

206
00:28:04,208 --> 00:28:05,833
Almost.

207
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:08,000
Is this make-up?

208
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:10,417
Yes, for work.

209
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,542
For work?

210
00:28:12,583 --> 00:28:15,292
You told me you spend all day
chasing paintings.

211
00:28:15,417 --> 00:28:17,500
It's my job.

212
00:28:18,167 --> 00:28:21,042
Well, you better show me that you were
worth the wait.

213
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:25,208
Yes ma'am.

214
00:28:32,417 --> 00:28:35,167
Suspect is on Seventh street.

215
00:28:36,417 --> 00:28:38,417
Great music.

216
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,750
Excuse me.

217
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:52,292
Repeat, blue car...

218
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:55,333
54, I'm near.

219
00:28:55,417 --> 00:28:57,417
Copy that, 54.

220
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:05,958
So, Salim,
is it true?

221
00:29:06,083 --> 00:29:07,375
- Yes, yes!
- Listen!

222
00:29:07,417 --> 00:29:10,333
Yes, hello.
Are you home?

223
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:13,333
No, I am in a palace
with a view of the Eiffel Tower.

224
00:29:15,167 --> 00:29:19,000
- And where is your palace?
- Champs-Elysées.

225
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:22,417
Nice neighborhood.

226
00:29:22,458 --> 00:29:25,083
Well, we can hear you,
would you like to dedicate it to someone.

227
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,167
Yes, to Sofia.

228
00:29:27,208 --> 00:29:30,833
Well, "Push the Air",
is for her.

229
00:29:32,167 --> 00:29:34,875
Well, you know...

230
00:29:43,292 --> 00:29:45,083
- No!
- Shit!

231
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:50,083
What's going on?

232
00:29:51,292 --> 00:29:53,792
It'll be okay.

233
00:29:56,167 --> 00:29:58,125
- Samir.
- What?

234
00:29:58,208 --> 00:30:00,083
The police.

235
00:30:05,125 --> 00:30:07,375
- Turn down the music.
- It's just music.

236
00:30:08,167 --> 00:30:10,167
- We're not doing anything wrong.
- I'll decide that.

237
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:12,208
Your papers, both of you, now.

238
00:30:12,292 --> 00:30:14,417
- Here.
- Take it.

239
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:19,042
- Who's car is this?
- My dad's.

240
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:20,750
Drivers license?

241
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:23,000
Don't have it, I took his car.

242
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:24,292
And your license?

243
00:30:24,333 --> 00:30:26,042
I'm 17, I don't have a license!

244
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:28,083
We're not doing anything except
listening to music.

245
00:30:28,167 --> 00:30:30,125
Since when is it a crime to listen to music?

246
00:30:30,208 --> 00:30:32,000
We're not bothering anyone.

247
00:30:32,083 --> 00:30:34,000
- C'mon get out of the car.
- No.

248
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:35,625
Hurry up.

249
00:30:51,167 --> 00:30:53,500
Shit! Again.

250
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:56,333
Go see what happened.

251
00:30:57,625 --> 00:30:59,792
OK.

252
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:07,792
- What the hell is this?
- Don't know.

253
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:10,167
Start filming.

254
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:37,875
- What's happening here, officer?
- Routine stop.

255
00:31:37,958 --> 00:31:40,958
Girls listening to music in a car aren't dangerous.

256
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:43,250
Why not search the car? These girls transport...

257
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:45,125
...drugs in this neighborhood.

258
00:31:45,208 --> 00:31:47,917
We'll give them the benefit
of the doubt tonight.

259
00:31:48,042 --> 00:31:49,958
- Know how to drive?
- Yes.

260
00:31:50,042 --> 00:31:51,417
- Then leave.
- But I don't have a license.

261
00:31:51,458 --> 00:31:52,917
Leave!

262
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,125
Shit, he let them go.
She doesn't even have a license.

263
00:32:01,917 --> 00:32:03,250
What do we do?
Follow them?

264
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:05,000
- No, no.
- Wait.

265
00:32:05,042 --> 00:32:06,417
- Keep filming.
- That's what I'm doing

266
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,083
Which unit are you with exactly?

267
00:32:09,167 --> 00:32:11,125
Secret Service.

268
00:32:11,208 --> 00:32:13,625
Let's talk in the car.

269
00:32:24,167 --> 00:32:25,250
Shit!

270
00:32:25,292 --> 00:32:27,083
Don't you move, keep filming.

271
00:32:27,167 --> 00:32:29,750
- And what's this?
- Keep filming.

272
00:32:37,167 --> 00:32:39,417
And what's this?

273
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:44,083
Zoom in on the plates, zoom in.

274
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:46,000
Already did.

275
00:32:46,083 --> 00:32:48,167
Shit, I've never
seen anything like this.

276
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,667
Give it here, I'll do it.

277
00:32:52,083 --> 00:32:53,250
- Samir.
- What?

278
00:32:53,292 --> 00:32:56,167
Police that murder
police, that's a fucking bomb.

279
00:32:56,917 --> 00:33:00,917
Precisely, before seeing it explode,
we'll wait to hear the official version.

280
00:33:01,083 --> 00:33:02,958
We'll do that.

281
00:33:37,167 --> 00:33:38,708
What?

282
00:33:38,792 --> 00:33:41,417
- A police cruiser here?
- What the fuck?

283
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,625
They crazy?

284
00:33:44,167 --> 00:33:45,792
What are they doing?

285
00:33:46,167 --> 00:33:48,667
Something bad, you can be sure of it.

286
00:33:48,958 --> 00:33:51,000
Yo, are you lost?

287
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:53,917
- This ain't a parking lot.
- Damn right.

288
00:33:57,125 --> 00:33:59,750
- Have them framed?
- Proceed.

289
00:34:00,167 --> 00:34:01,833
Perfect.

290
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,708
They're firing!

291
00:34:06,083 --> 00:34:07,458
Shoot!

292
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:15,125
C'mon you idiots...

293
00:34:18,042 --> 00:34:20,792
- The clock is synchronized?
- Affirmative.

294
00:34:20,917 --> 00:34:23,667
We got what we needed, let's go.

295
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:33,958
DISS.

296
00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:11,250
Where you going?

297
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,917
Keep sleeping, I'm gonna catch a movie.

298
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:29,875
Get down, lie flat on the ground, hands up!

299
00:35:29,958 --> 00:35:32,167
- Police!
- On the ground now!

300
00:35:33,375 --> 00:35:35,000
Damien!

301
00:35:35,083 --> 00:35:37,292
What's happening?

302
00:35:38,042 --> 00:35:40,875
Who is the commander of
this unit? I want to speak to him.

303
00:35:42,042 --> 00:35:43,667
I am.

304
00:35:45,958 --> 00:35:48,042
I think you've got the wrong person.

305
00:35:48,125 --> 00:35:51,875
Damien Tomaso, Captain of Special Forces. 31 years old.

306
00:35:56,125 --> 00:35:58,958
What's the meaning of this?

307
00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:01,833
Captain, we found
this in the kitchen.

308
00:36:02,958 --> 00:36:06,000
Well, here's your reason, c'mon gather some things...

309
00:36:06,167 --> 00:36:08,375
...you're coming with us.

310
00:36:27,167 --> 00:36:29,042
This is bullshit.

311
00:36:30,125 --> 00:36:31,958
Georges, explain.

312
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,792
For six months you've promised us results.

313
00:36:35,917 --> 00:36:38,833
Mr. President, we don't have the means to search each block
and district.

314
00:36:38,958 --> 00:36:41,625
Save your excuses, please.

315
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:44,792
There was a
contingency plan.

316
00:36:44,917 --> 00:36:47,750
So something must have improved.

317
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:50,875
Explain to me, how it could get to this?

318
00:36:51,958 --> 00:36:54,792
I assure you this isn't a normal case.

319
00:36:56,042 --> 00:36:58,792
- What is it then?
- Well it's...

320
00:36:58,875 --> 00:37:01,708
...an isolated incident, nothing more.

321
00:37:02,042 --> 00:37:03,583
I hope you're right.

322
00:37:03,958 --> 00:37:06,917
In the meantime put someone on the case.
Someone serious and effective.

323
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:10,000
This Tomaso, for example.

324
00:37:10,083 --> 00:37:11,875
Is this a typical case for him?

325
00:37:11,958 --> 00:37:14,833
Thought about him, but he was arrested
for drug trafficking this morning.

326
00:37:16,042 --> 00:37:17,917
Tomaso? You sure?

327
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,750
Unfortunately.

328
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,167
I was about to promote him...

329
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:27,917
I also had Gazman in mind, the boss of DISS.
They are well informed on this district.

330
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,542
Yes, very well. Very Well.

331
00:37:47,125 --> 00:37:49,000
Mr. President.

332
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:51,333
What? Already?

333
00:37:52,042 --> 00:37:54,125
I guess they are aware of the
situation.

334
00:37:54,208 --> 00:37:57,000
I've been briefed, Mr. President.

335
00:37:57,083 --> 00:37:58,000
Very well.

336
00:37:58,042 --> 00:38:00,792
If that film is leaked, we could
lose all credibility.

337
00:38:00,917 --> 00:38:03,750
Put a civilian car in its place.

338
00:38:05,042 --> 00:38:07,542
We have 48 hours.

339
00:38:08,833 --> 00:38:11,792
That's exactly how long you have to solve this case.

340
00:38:11,917 --> 00:38:13,458
- Use the utmost discretion.
- Yes, sir.

341
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,625
Will do, Mr. President.

342
00:38:26,083 --> 00:38:29,917
He doesn't realize war has never been
at odds with democracy.

343
00:38:32,208 --> 00:38:34,958
Special Report:
Last night in district 13...

344
00:38:35,792 --> 00:38:38,750
...an altercation between a band of thugs
and law enforcement...

345
00:39:01,917 --> 00:39:04,667
- Damn!
- Look, it's an internal camera.

346
00:39:08,917 --> 00:39:11,917
This is shit!
This was not for fun!

347
00:39:15,917 --> 00:39:17,833
Yeah?
And why are you here?

348
00:39:17,917 --> 00:39:19,917
I was in the wrong place

349
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,750
It's no reason for them to lock me up.

350
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,417
You did good, now get out!

351
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,875
I have rights!

352
00:39:41,208 --> 00:39:44,875
Go, see to your friends and tell them to watch their
backs.

353
00:39:54,042 --> 00:39:55,417
Let's go!

354
00:39:56,833 --> 00:39:58,958
- Which district?
- 13.

355
00:39:59,542 --> 00:40:00,708
Perfect.

356
00:40:00,792 --> 00:40:03,333
Boss, can I show you something?

357
00:40:07,042 --> 00:40:09,208
They sent us this.

358
00:40:16,042 --> 00:40:18,792
It's the camera that
transmitted yesterday.

359
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,917
But look at this.

360
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:28,750
Probably some boys intent on
looking for girls.

361
00:40:30,917 --> 00:40:33,958
When I saw them,
I zoomed in...

362
00:40:36,708 --> 00:40:39,417
...and saw this.

363
00:40:40,708 --> 00:40:43,292
Shit, they filmed it.

364
00:40:43,302 --> 00:40:43,873
Yes.

365
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:46,833
Find this license plate number immediately.

366
00:40:46,958 --> 00:40:48,208
- I'm on it.
- Perfect.

367
00:41:04,917 --> 00:41:06,625
Leïto, they're looking for me.

368
00:41:07,917 --> 00:41:10,917
- I filmed it all and now they're looking for me.
- What are you talking about?

369
00:41:11,042 --> 00:41:12,917
About the car of the television.

370
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,750
Shit!

371
00:41:16,125 --> 00:41:17,708
Here!

372
00:41:21,708 --> 00:41:22,917
Halt!

373
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:44,833
- That is Samir.
- Halt!

374
00:41:44,917 --> 00:41:46,958
Let him go, let him go!

375
00:41:47,875 --> 00:41:49,083
Let him go!

376
00:41:49,333 --> 00:41:51,667
Calm down, or we'll take you too.

377
00:41:52,792 --> 00:41:54,500
Let him go!

378
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:08,708
Open door 14.

379
00:42:10,875 --> 00:42:12,375
Go.

380
00:42:13,875 --> 00:42:16,667
- Can you loan me a cellular?
- Anything else you want?

381
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,625
My cellular.

382
00:42:27,958 --> 00:42:29,208
Thanks.

383
00:42:33,208 --> 00:42:35,125
C'mon, answer.

384
00:42:35,708 --> 00:42:38,708
Leïto, it's Damian, I'm fucked dude,
I could really use a hand...

385
00:42:39,875 --> 00:42:41,667
I'm not home right now...

386
00:42:41,958 --> 00:42:44,125
...or maybe you don't have the balls
to say it in my face...

387
00:42:44,417 --> 00:42:45,542
...so leave a message.

388
00:42:45,583 --> 00:42:47,750
You have to help me Leïto,
it's Damian.

389
00:42:48,583 --> 00:42:51,417
I'm in the basement of the central police station.

390
00:42:51,792 --> 00:42:53,292
I've been framed.

391
00:42:53,708 --> 00:42:55,625
I need to get out of here.

392
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,625
I know I can count on you.

393
00:43:01,792 --> 00:43:04,333
Let go of the telephone!

394
00:43:15,167 --> 00:43:16,958
What's up, guys?

395
00:43:19,667 --> 00:43:22,250
The police are everywhere, you crazy?

396
00:43:22,375 --> 00:43:23,833
Yes, I know.

397
00:43:23,875 --> 00:43:25,083
Everywhere.

398
00:43:25,125 --> 00:43:26,750
Got you.

399
00:43:33,875 --> 00:43:35,708
Be out in a minute.

400
00:43:40,042 --> 00:43:41,125
Yes?

401
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,292
He called someone and explained the situation.

402
00:43:43,667 --> 00:43:46,708
- Who'd he call?
- Some guy called Leïto.

403
00:43:47,042 --> 00:43:48,417
We traced it to district 13.

404
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,833
- They know each other?
- Yes, they're close.

405
00:43:51,833 --> 00:43:54,375
Bring me this Leïto,
let's not take a risk.

406
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:34,708
You have a new message.

407
00:44:36,375 --> 00:44:41,625
Leïto, I've been calling you
but you're never there. Well, bye-bye.

408
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,708
Don't move!

409
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:12,958
- You can't pass.
- Think it over.

410
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,083
Good decision.

411
00:45:19,708 --> 00:45:21,292
Let's talk seriously.

412
00:45:21,667 --> 00:45:24,208
Someone has to die.
And it's you.

413
00:45:27,625 --> 00:45:29,625
Up! Up!

414
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,417
- Shit, they left.
- But she does not have a license.

415
00:45:39,542 --> 00:45:41,625
- What do we do?
-Should we follow?

416
00:45:41,708 --> 00:45:43,292
- Go, go.
- No, stay.

417
00:45:43,333 --> 00:45:45,625
- Keep filming.
- That's what I'm doing.

418
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:48,667
- What are you filming?
- Keep recording.

419
00:45:52,542 --> 00:45:53,750
Shit!

420
00:45:53,833 --> 00:45:55,708
Don't move, keep filming.

421
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:58,417
- And what is this?
- Keep filming.

422
00:45:58,708 --> 00:46:00,667
And what is this?

423
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:03,417
The plates, zoom in on the plates.

424
00:46:03,542 --> 00:46:05,000
Already doing it.

425
00:46:05,042 --> 00:46:07,667
Shit, I've never seen anything like this.

426
00:46:19,667 --> 00:46:20,833
Go, go.

427
00:46:31,708 --> 00:46:35,083
Leïto, it's Damian, I'm fucked,
I could really use a hand

428
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:38,833
I'm in the basement of the central police station.

429
00:46:39,458 --> 00:46:41,417
Somebody framed me.

430
00:46:41,708 --> 00:46:43,458
I need to get out of here.

431
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,500
I know I can count on you.

432
00:46:57,625 --> 00:47:00,458
Leïto, it's Damian, I'm fucked,
I could really use a hand

433
00:47:00,583 --> 00:47:03,542
I'm in the basement of the central police station.

434
00:47:15,667 --> 00:47:17,458
Somebody framed me.

435
00:47:42,625 --> 00:47:44,500
I need to get out of here.

436
00:47:44,792 --> 00:47:47,583
I know I can count on you.

437
00:48:22,583 --> 00:48:25,458
What are you doing here?
Hurry up!

438
00:48:30,667 --> 00:48:33,500
He just disappeared.
We'll look for him.

439
00:48:54,583 --> 00:48:56,167
Hurry! Hurry!

440
00:49:20,917 --> 00:49:22,667
This way!

441
00:49:41,625 --> 00:49:43,000
There he goes!

442
00:50:02,042 --> 00:50:04,167
Go the other way!

443
00:50:38,542 --> 00:50:40,208
Wait! Wait!

444
00:50:40,542 --> 00:50:44,292
Go! Go!

445
00:51:02,583 --> 00:51:05,500
Go, shit! There he is!
Quickly!

446
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,167
Shit!

447
00:51:17,542 --> 00:51:19,417
You were shopping?

448
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,583
- No, sir.
- So you're incapable of trapping...

449
00:51:21,667 --> 00:51:23,333
...one boy with three units?

450
00:51:23,417 --> 00:51:25,417
The individual is very skillful, sir,
never seen anything like him.

451
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,792
Next time ask him for lessons.

452
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:30,583
Return to base, I will go
see the President.

453
00:51:30,667 --> 00:51:31,542
Yes, sir.

454
00:51:31,583 --> 00:51:32,958
And how are things out there?

455
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,917
They're aren't going to take long
to escalate.

456
00:51:49,458 --> 00:51:53,333
We didn't kill him on purpose,
I swear.

457
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:56,250
He tried to leave... what can you do?

458
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,667
Explain it to his mother.

459
00:52:01,458 --> 00:52:03,250
Move!

460
00:52:14,417 --> 00:52:16,333
Front and center!

461
00:52:18,583 --> 00:52:20,917
Let's go!

462
00:52:46,708 --> 00:52:48,292
Can I help you?

463
00:52:48,583 --> 00:52:50,875
Can I see the boss please?

464
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,333
Boss, there is a guy out here who
wants to see you.

465
00:52:54,458 --> 00:52:56,917
- Send him in.
- C'mon.

466
00:53:00,208 --> 00:53:02,667
- What's this about?
- I'd like a room, please.

467
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,292
Are you joking?
This is not a hotel.

468
00:53:05,875 --> 00:53:07,917
Outside it says
"Police Hotel."

469
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,292
Get out before you piss me off.

470
00:53:10,375 --> 00:53:11,958
Get the hell out!

471
00:53:12,042 --> 00:53:14,625
Listen, it's better for everyone
if you lock me up.

472
00:53:14,708 --> 00:53:18,583
I'm a criminal of some potential
and I might do something stupid.

473
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:21,042
Have you committed some crime?

474
00:53:21,125 --> 00:53:22,292
No.

475
00:53:22,333 --> 00:53:25,417
Then you know what?
Come back when you have.

476
00:53:25,583 --> 00:53:28,167
We'll give you a nice clean cell, okay?

477
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:29,625
Okay.

478
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:32,583
Get on the ground, on the ground!

479
00:53:32,625 --> 00:53:34,958
Don't move you!
Do not move!

480
00:53:36,333 --> 00:53:38,125
Open door 14.

481
00:53:41,208 --> 00:53:43,542
You're in luck, the only cell we had left.

482
00:53:43,625 --> 00:53:46,458
- But there is no linen or food.
- What is there?

483
00:53:47,167 --> 00:53:48,667
What were you expecting?

484
00:53:56,417 --> 00:53:58,208
Let him go.

485
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,375
I said let him go!

486
00:54:09,708 --> 00:54:11,708
Security.

487
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:14,167
Security, the doors
are blocked off.

488
00:54:20,792 --> 00:54:22,875
You sure took your time.

489
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:26,167
Want me to come back when you're
in a better mood?

490
00:54:26,292 --> 00:54:27,958
No, that's okay.

491
00:54:29,042 --> 00:54:31,292
- I'm glad to see you man.
- Me too.

492
00:54:32,375 --> 00:54:34,333
Everything is going to shit out there,
you sure you want out?

493
00:54:34,417 --> 00:54:36,375
Yes, I have scores to settle.

494
00:54:36,458 --> 00:54:37,792
Let's get outta here.
You got a plan?

495
00:54:37,833 --> 00:54:39,417
Why don't you have a plan?

496
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:42,333
I thought since you got in here so easily,
that you'd have a plan.

497
00:54:44,833 --> 00:54:46,375
Getting in wasn't so difficult.

498
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:50,083
It's getting out that's going to
pose a little bit of a problem.

499
00:54:59,042 --> 00:55:00,417
You're well trained.

500
00:55:00,458 --> 00:55:02,125
Yes, more or less.

501
00:55:02,208 --> 00:55:04,417
C'mon, I know a shortcut.

502
00:55:11,667 --> 00:55:13,708
This is your shortcut?

503
00:55:25,583 --> 00:55:28,083
Run! Run!

504
00:55:41,667 --> 00:55:43,542
Tomaso escaped from his cell.

505
00:55:43,625 --> 00:55:45,333
He's gone already?

506
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:47,375
No, he's still inside.

507
00:55:47,917 --> 00:55:50,250
- Find him.
- Yes sir.

508
00:55:50,333 --> 00:55:51,708
And fast.

509
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:54,208
...in district 13...

510
00:55:54,333 --> 00:55:56,375
Gentlemen.

511
00:55:56,458 --> 00:55:58,333
It's begun?

512
00:55:58,875 --> 00:56:00,458
...of law enforcement...

513
00:56:00,542 --> 00:56:03,208
...and the incidents
have multiplied.

514
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:07,292
Among the injured are numerous officials.

515
00:56:09,417 --> 00:56:12,250
Well, commander,
how's it coming?

516
00:56:12,375 --> 00:56:14,917
District 13
is out of control.

517
00:56:15,042 --> 00:56:18,167
And there is a risk that the surrounding sectors
may join them.

518
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:21,333
The whole country could be
on high alert in 24 hours.

519
00:56:21,833 --> 00:56:26,167
General do you still advise a military
intervention as a preventive measure?

520
00:56:26,375 --> 00:56:28,333
Yes. But the army...

521
00:56:28,417 --> 00:56:31,208
...doesn't have the time to
prepare for an internal invasion.

522
00:56:32,042 --> 00:56:35,208
Unfortunately, time is a luxury
we don't have.

523
00:56:38,375 --> 00:56:41,125
Mr. Gazman - your recommendation?

524
00:56:42,167 --> 00:56:44,333
When gangrene spreads, the area must
be cut off.

525
00:56:44,417 --> 00:56:50,167
Well, I wasn't elected due to my tolerance
for metaphors.

526
00:56:50,792 --> 00:56:53,208
When I ask for a recommendation,
I expect one.

527
00:56:53,333 --> 00:56:55,417
Well, Mr. President,
I'll be more direct

528
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:58,208
Evacuate the entire district 13
in twelve hours.

529
00:56:58,292 --> 00:57:01,833
Tomorrow morning, we'll demolish the district
entirely, and no one will be able to return there.

530
00:57:02,333 --> 00:57:04,333
And there are other advantages.

531
00:57:04,417 --> 00:57:06,208
This will create new jobs.

532
00:57:06,292 --> 00:57:08,667
We'll build a new neighborhood
full of citizens...

533
00:57:08,792 --> 00:57:11,250
...that will probably vote for
you in the next elections.

534
00:57:13,458 --> 00:57:16,000
It could not be more clear.

535
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:17,833
Gentlemen.

536
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:20,458
Any thoughts?

537
00:57:20,833 --> 00:57:24,000
Politically, this solution
would be extremely dangerous.

538
00:57:24,417 --> 00:57:26,667
What's your solution?

539
00:57:32,083 --> 00:57:33,417
Well...

540
00:57:34,208 --> 00:57:37,458
I notice that none of you have
any specific proposal...

541
00:57:37,583 --> 00:57:39,500
...to defend
our democracy.

542
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:40,833
Very interesting.

543
00:57:40,875 --> 00:57:43,417
Remember that our primary function
is to protect the French people...

544
00:57:43,542 --> 00:57:45,125
...and look after their interests.

545
00:57:45,208 --> 00:57:48,292
And to ensure that the values of
freedom, equality, and brotherhood...

546
00:57:48,417 --> 00:57:52,000
...are still respected
in this country.

547
00:57:52,125 --> 00:57:55,958
That is, how should I say?
The entire foundation of our republic.

548
00:57:56,625 --> 00:58:00,417
And the only proposition you bring to
me, is to demolish the place? Disgusting.

549
00:58:01,375 --> 00:58:02,375
Thank you.

550
00:58:02,417 --> 00:58:04,833
Mr. President,
the idea is abhorrent...

551
00:58:04,958 --> 00:58:07,250
...but we have priorities.

552
00:58:07,333 --> 00:58:10,875
Perhaps in two hours
the situation will be uncontrollable.

553
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,208
Perhaps it isn't the best idea...

554
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:17,500
...but it is the lesser evil.

555
00:58:17,917 --> 00:58:19,375
General...

556
00:58:19,792 --> 00:58:22,750
...can we evacuate a million civilians
in twelve hours?

557
00:58:22,875 --> 00:58:25,000
If you give the order now,
it's possible.

558
00:58:25,083 --> 00:58:28,708
I suppose some clan bosses won't be
so easily evacuated.

559
00:58:29,208 --> 00:58:31,000
Who will miss them?

560
00:58:43,375 --> 00:58:44,958
General.

561
00:58:45,833 --> 00:58:48,000
Proceed with the evacuation.

562
00:58:48,083 --> 00:58:51,708
We'll begin planning tomorrow morning.

563
00:58:53,208 --> 00:58:57,667
Mr. Gazman, I trust that all
the inhabitants of this neighborhood...

564
00:58:57,875 --> 00:59:01,042
will be treated with respect
and dignity, and I mean...

565
00:59:01,167 --> 00:59:02,625
...ALL.

566
00:59:02,875 --> 00:59:05,708
I'll give the order personally,
Mr. President.

567
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:07,542
Dismissed.

568
00:59:15,333 --> 00:59:16,917
Go that way!

569
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:21,000
Keep looking!

570
00:59:30,875 --> 00:59:32,875
We're okay here.

571
00:59:35,458 --> 00:59:39,708
- They weren't Police?
- They found drugs in my kitchen.

572
00:59:40,833 --> 00:59:42,417
Don't you know how to hide shit?

573
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:45,375
Wasn't mine.
They planted it.

574
00:59:46,042 --> 00:59:47,208
Classic.

575
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,292
Police that want to fuck
other policemen.

576
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:50,458
It's not common.

577
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:52,125
Above all, I have to ask, why?

578
00:59:52,208 --> 00:59:54,542
To stop you from going anywhere.

579
00:59:54,625 --> 00:59:55,292
They know how social you are.

580
00:59:55,333 --> 00:59:56,333
I don't know.

581
00:59:56,375 --> 00:59:58,583
I'm sure it's something dirty that
they don't want you to stick your nose in.

582
00:59:58,917 --> 01:00:01,292
Super cops aren't good for everything.

583
01:00:01,417 --> 01:00:03,667
They would have given me vacation time
or promoted me somewhere else.

584
01:00:04,125 --> 01:00:05,458
Would you have taken a promotion?

585
01:00:07,042 --> 01:00:08,708
No, of course not.

586
01:00:14,083 --> 01:00:15,792
Do you know what's happening out there?

587
01:00:15,875 --> 01:00:17,292
What's happening?

588
01:00:17,333 --> 01:00:20,250
There is a recording that shows some
thugs riddling...

589
01:00:20,375 --> 01:00:21,708
...a patrol car with bullets.

590
01:00:22,875 --> 01:00:25,208
But there is another recording which
shows it was the cops...

591
01:00:25,333 --> 01:00:28,208
...who shot up that patrol car.

592
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:31,042
What was the patrol car
doing in district 13?

593
01:00:31,375 --> 01:00:33,000
It may have been transported.

594
01:00:33,333 --> 01:00:34,198
And afterwards?

595
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:37,667
After I got the second video,
part of the building exploded.

596
01:00:38,583 --> 01:00:41,125
It was the police.

597
01:00:44,625 --> 01:00:45,917
But I managed to escape.

598
01:00:49,292 --> 01:00:51,042
They are not police.

599
01:00:51,125 --> 01:00:53,500
They must be criminals passing
themselves off as cops.

600
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:55,917
Why? For fun?

601
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,375
It's a strategy to do away with
District 13.

602
01:00:58,875 --> 01:01:00,625
And afterwards build on top of it.

603
01:01:07,042 --> 01:01:08,917
Remember the license plate?

604
01:01:11,208 --> 01:01:13,583
They all have the same
license plate: DISS.

605
01:01:16,375 --> 01:01:18,125
DISS, I don't believe it.

606
01:01:18,208 --> 01:01:19,708
What is it?

607
01:01:20,333 --> 01:01:22,917
Secret internal security division.

608
01:01:23,333 --> 01:01:24,667
Damn, that's it.

609
01:01:24,708 --> 01:01:28,250
They receive their orders directly
from the President.

610
01:01:30,125 --> 01:01:32,292
The DISS boss is Gazman Multer.

611
01:01:32,375 --> 01:01:35,125
- You know him?
- No, not really.

612
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,917
They wanted to transfer me there
six months ago. I turned it down.

613
01:01:39,042 --> 01:01:42,208
Well there you go, you've got a
guilty party, motive, and a crime.

614
01:01:43,958 --> 01:01:46,708
Only thing missing is proof.

615
01:01:47,167 --> 01:01:49,042
What about this?

616
01:01:53,833 --> 01:01:56,250
That won't be sufficient.

617
01:01:56,958 --> 01:01:59,250
You need something that'll really
bother them.

618
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:07,750
- What are you doing?
- Thinking.

619
01:02:08,125 --> 01:02:10,417
It scares me when you think a lot.

620
01:02:10,708 --> 01:02:14,042
- We have to get to Walter's office.
- I was afraid of that.

621
01:02:14,208 --> 01:02:17,125
- Where is it?
- First floor, office 17.

622
01:02:19,583 --> 01:02:21,667
The old-fashioned way?

623
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:23,833
Fine, the old-fashioned way.

624
01:02:45,333 --> 01:02:47,958
Can't you be discreet, like me?

625
01:02:48,042 --> 01:02:50,708
Being discreet doesn't matter here.

626
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,750
Now what?

627
01:02:56,167 --> 01:02:58,250
I'm thinking.

628
01:02:58,333 --> 01:02:59,917
There they are!

629
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,250
I don't like this.

630
01:03:29,292 --> 01:03:31,000
Any ideas?

631
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,958
I'll entertain them, you
get to Walter's office

632
01:03:35,083 --> 01:03:37,167
Remember, first floor, office 17.

633
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:39,125
Bring whatever proof you have.

634
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:41,042
Will we see each other again?

635
01:03:41,333 --> 01:03:44,583
I doubt I'll be going very far, go!

636
01:04:01,167 --> 01:04:02,750
Now you'll see!

637
01:04:40,917 --> 01:04:43,958
If you stay put, and remain silent, nothing
will happen.

638
01:04:44,417 --> 01:04:45,833
You have my word, okay?

639
01:04:48,042 --> 01:04:49,958
Which is Mr. Garzo's computer?

640
01:04:53,625 --> 01:04:55,083
What's the password?

641
01:05:07,042 --> 01:05:09,000
Good morning, any of you
have a computer...

642
01:05:09,083 --> 01:05:10,292
...that moved by itself?

643
01:05:10,333 --> 01:05:11,833
Yes, me.

644
01:05:11,917 --> 01:05:15,000
Tech service, I'm here to install
the new server.

645
01:05:18,083 --> 01:05:20,000
Sorry for the inconvenience.

646
01:05:24,917 --> 01:05:26,417
Found it.

647
01:05:30,875 --> 01:05:32,625
Thank you, gentlemen.

648
01:06:10,875 --> 01:06:12,083
Damien.

649
01:06:13,542 --> 01:06:16,917
Be reasonable and let justice handle
this problem.

650
01:06:21,542 --> 01:06:24,542
You know very well, I did nothing wrong.

651
01:06:25,875 --> 01:06:29,083
Yeah I know. prisons are full of
innocents.

652
01:06:30,792 --> 01:06:33,375
However, the farms...

653
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:37,208
Well, you ready?

654
01:06:53,958 --> 01:06:55,167
The things I do for you.

655
01:06:55,208 --> 01:06:56,583
Don't worry I'll pay up soon.

656
01:06:58,458 --> 01:06:59,917
Don't let them go!

657
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,917
Shit!

658
01:07:06,917 --> 01:07:08,417
We can follow on foot, right?

659
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:11,042
Put on the belt.

660
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,792
- What are you doing?
- Well, going ahead as planned.

661
01:07:51,125 --> 01:07:52,500
Excuse me.

662
01:07:56,958 --> 01:07:57,917
I'm listening.

663
01:07:58,167 --> 01:07:59,875
- Damien escaped.
- How did he escape?

664
01:08:00,167 --> 01:08:01,792
Leïto Came for him.

665
01:08:01,875 --> 01:08:03,750
He came for him and they escaped together.

666
01:08:03,792 --> 01:08:06,250
Explain to me how they escaped.

667
01:08:06,875 --> 01:08:08,667
Through your office.

668
01:08:08,958 --> 01:08:10,917
What should we do?
Pursue them?

669
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,708
No, too dangerous, there are soldiers
everywhere.

670
01:08:13,833 --> 01:08:16,000
Stay alert anyway.

671
01:08:16,083 --> 01:08:17,667
Understood.

672
01:08:24,958 --> 01:08:27,333
Follow the instructions that were given.

673
01:08:35,792 --> 01:08:37,917
And where will you take us?

674
01:09:08,917 --> 01:09:10,875
There's always a watchdog somewhere.

675
01:09:10,958 --> 01:09:12,958
Yes, it was you who promised me
things would change.

676
01:09:13,042 --> 01:09:15,458
That there would always be some fool
to enforce the law.

677
01:09:15,542 --> 01:09:17,833
Laws are not evil, the people who
enforce them are.

678
01:09:17,958 --> 01:09:20,500
Yeah, like religion. Speaking of which,
what's yours.

679
01:09:20,875 --> 01:09:23,833
They baptized me when I was a boy,
but right now my only objective...

680
01:09:23,958 --> 01:09:25,958
...is the civil code.

681
01:09:26,042 --> 01:09:27,542
What?

682
01:09:27,583 --> 01:09:29,917
My only aim at present
is to enforce the civil code.

683
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,875
You're worse than a Mormon.

684
01:09:34,833 --> 01:09:37,042
- Well, should we go or stay?
- Go.

685
01:09:58,958 --> 01:10:00,750
- What you want?
- To Speak with Tao.

686
01:10:00,833 --> 01:10:02,042
About what?

687
01:10:02,083 --> 01:10:04,208
About the district
and its inhabitants.

688
01:10:04,917 --> 01:10:07,583
He's kidding.
Business.

689
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,792
Let them pass.

690
01:10:44,250 --> 01:10:45,583
What are you doing here?

691
01:10:47,792 --> 01:10:50,708
Stole it from a national security team.

692
01:10:50,833 --> 01:10:52,500
It's good.

693
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:55,708
Well?

694
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:58,875
We'll give it to you, if you help us get
some things that are of interest to us.

695
01:10:59,708 --> 01:11:01,000
What's this?

696
01:11:01,042 --> 01:11:02,750
A bit of catechism.

697
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:05,917
You've lived your whole life in district 13.

698
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Where do you think you'll live
when they destroy it?

699
01:11:08,083 --> 01:11:10,208
We must avoid that.

700
01:11:14,833 --> 01:11:16,875
Aniel, take this out.

701
01:11:44,917 --> 01:11:46,625
Okay. It's open.

702
01:11:46,708 --> 01:11:48,792
- They're everywhere.
- Everywhere.

703
01:11:48,875 --> 01:11:50,708
Where'd you learn that?

704
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:52,875
In books of course.

705
01:11:54,917 --> 01:11:56,875
Go on, do it.

706
01:12:00,875 --> 01:12:03,083
This is interesting to me.

707
01:12:03,708 --> 01:12:06,542
- We're now over Iran.
- This is also interesting to me.

708
01:12:06,917 --> 01:12:08,792
Here it is, district 13.

709
01:12:08,833 --> 01:12:10,792
These are the objectives,
five towers.

710
01:12:10,875 --> 01:12:13,000
There has to be something more.

711
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:16,542
Walter fixes it, so you take the blame.

712
01:12:16,667 --> 01:12:18,750
The President orders the destruction
and they build everything new.

713
01:12:18,833 --> 01:12:20,667
- Like in Iraq.
- Exactly.

714
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:22,750
Except now it's the French

715
01:12:22,833 --> 01:12:27,250
And how are they going to destroy
the towers?

716
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:30,250
In position.

717
01:12:56,625 --> 01:12:59,542
There are three helicopters.
They're up there already.

718
01:13:00,833 --> 01:13:02,792
The choppers will light
the targets with lasers.

719
01:13:03,208 --> 01:13:04,792
Next, the missiles.

720
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:10,875
How?

721
01:13:10,917 --> 01:13:13,417
Probably from a command center.

722
01:13:13,542 --> 01:13:15,750
Only the President of the Republic can
give an order like that.

723
01:13:15,833 --> 01:13:17,750
How can we prevent it.

724
01:13:17,833 --> 01:13:20,500
Better read the manual.
Because your little bossy voice...

725
01:13:20,583 --> 01:13:23,417
...is beginning to piss me off.

726
01:13:23,542 --> 01:13:26,625
It bothers you that I make jokes?

727
01:13:28,958 --> 01:13:30,542
I apologize.

728
01:13:31,917 --> 01:13:34,417
If I call you "cabbage head",
would you like this better?

729
01:13:34,542 --> 01:13:37,708
- And if you call me by my name?
- OK.

730
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:39,875
What's your name?

731
01:13:39,917 --> 01:13:42,750
Damien Tomaso, commander
of the French army.

732
01:13:44,708 --> 01:13:47,125
A policeman, if you prefer.

733
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:52,458
Now I think it's better if we put our
differences aside...

734
01:13:53,167 --> 01:13:55,625
...and give each other a hand.

735
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,917
Tao, a pleasure.

736
01:14:10,042 --> 01:14:11,708
Likewise.

737
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:17,708
Now, what's your plan,
cabbage head?

738
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:43,625
- Thanks for coming.
- What's this about?

739
01:14:44,625 --> 01:14:46,292
We'll explain it to you.

740
01:15:02,750 --> 01:15:04,083
Hello.

741
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:10,083
It's through there.

742
01:15:25,875 --> 01:15:27,917
Alika, guns.

743
01:15:29,708 --> 01:15:32,792
Marcho, specialist
in machetes.

744
01:15:34,625 --> 01:15:37,708
Carlos Skin,
specialist with cars.

745
01:15:39,542 --> 01:15:42,458
Montana, bombs.

746
01:15:43,792 --> 01:15:45,250
Excuse me.

747
01:15:48,542 --> 01:15:50,583
Can they cover these areas?

748
01:15:50,875 --> 01:15:53,458
Yes, they wouldn't let an opportunity
to show their skill pass them by.

749
01:15:59,625 --> 01:16:01,292
Gentlemen.

750
01:16:01,833 --> 01:16:04,167
Thanks to all
for coming.

751
01:16:04,792 --> 01:16:07,833
It's been 19 hours since district 13
was evacuated.

752
01:16:08,542 --> 01:16:10,583
Their intention is to level it completely.

753
01:16:10,667 --> 01:16:13,458
I have everything that we need.

754
01:16:14,458 --> 01:16:16,708
The idea is to avoid it.

755
01:16:19,667 --> 01:16:21,625
All in favor?

756
01:16:32,917 --> 01:16:35,708
Well, then I'll pass it off...

757
01:16:36,542 --> 01:16:39,542
...to Damien to explain his plan.

758
01:16:45,625 --> 01:16:49,583
We all have to come to an agreement in the
five hours we have left.

759
01:16:50,750 --> 01:16:53,750
I'll need about thirty men...

760
01:16:54,625 --> 01:16:56,750
...trained in combat,
with no need for weapons.

761
01:16:56,833 --> 01:16:58,250
We're not going hunting.

762
01:16:58,292 --> 01:17:00,500
We infiltrate in silence, neutralize the enemy...

763
01:17:00,583 --> 01:17:03,375
...and go directly
to the centre of operations.

764
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:06,083
Questions?

765
01:17:06,667 --> 01:17:09,042
Where is the command center?

766
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:15,000
Here, in Paris.

767
01:17:29,708 --> 01:17:32,167
Through here, Mr. President.

768
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:42,625
Reinforce the security
around the building.

769
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:47,458
Go give the signal.

770
01:17:55,542 --> 01:17:58,125
Remain in the air.

771
01:18:01,583 --> 01:18:04,250
Good morning, gentlemen.
Take your seats.

772
01:18:06,458 --> 01:18:08,625
So, General,
where are we on this?

773
01:18:08,708 --> 01:18:11,583
The pilots are waiting for the order to
engage the targets.

774
01:18:11,708 --> 01:18:14,625
I was talking about evacuation not destruction.

775
01:18:15,458 --> 01:18:17,542
That's our priority is it not?

776
01:18:18,083 --> 01:18:19,375
Yes, sir.

777
01:18:19,708 --> 01:18:21,250
Mr. President.

778
01:18:21,708 --> 01:18:25,125
We've evacuated 1,087,310
people in the last twelve hours...

779
01:18:25,625 --> 01:18:27,917
...but there are sectors we can't get near.

780
01:18:28,042 --> 01:18:30,750
Precisely all the people
located here.

781
01:18:30,833 --> 01:18:32,667
We tried and there were casualties.

782
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:35,250
This could delay everything.

783
01:18:36,750 --> 01:18:39,250
How many people have not been evacuated?

784
01:18:39,333 --> 01:18:41,458
Long time since we did a census in this neighborhood...

785
01:18:41,583 --> 01:18:43,750
...but a few thousand people.

786
01:18:44,458 --> 01:18:47,333
Too many.
Continue the evacuation.

787
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:55,750
- Command sent us here.
- Us too!

788
01:19:07,583 --> 01:19:09,708
Very Well.

789
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:22,333
Turn both keys
at the same time.

790
01:19:22,458 --> 01:19:25,542
Five missiles, all will go out
at the same time.

791
01:20:12,625 --> 01:20:15,000
To tell you the truth,
gentlemen...

792
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:18,250
...I do not like this at all.

793
01:20:18,375 --> 01:20:21,042
- May I give you some advice?
- Please.

794
01:20:21,583 --> 01:20:24,292
I know these types of men.

795
01:20:24,625 --> 01:20:27,292
They don't respect anything, people,
laws, nothing.

796
01:20:27,417 --> 01:20:30,333
They kill and steal only for profit

797
01:20:30,417 --> 01:20:32,375
And you aren't responsible for that.

798
01:20:32,458 --> 01:20:34,042
They were here before your arrival.

799
01:20:34,125 --> 01:20:36,375
And what can we do with them?

800
01:20:36,458 --> 01:20:38,417
Speak with them?
No.

801
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:41,500
The only way to rid yourself of them is
extermination.

802
01:20:59,958 --> 01:21:01,375
Alert!

803
01:21:10,542 --> 01:21:13,375
Mr. Gazman, I find your cynicism offensive.

804
01:21:13,958 --> 01:21:16,583
No, Mr. President, I'm only
being pragmatic.

805
01:21:16,708 --> 01:21:21,292
One of the causes of our
recession is this parallel economy.

806
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:25,542
With these types around, we lose millions in taxes
which should be coming to the state.

807
01:21:26,333 --> 01:21:28,375
With this destruction...

808
01:21:28,458 --> 01:21:32,208
...we can build a place that
will actually be earning us money

809
01:21:32,583 --> 01:21:35,458
We can rid ourselves of this scar,
and build something new and profitable.

810
01:21:35,792 --> 01:21:39,458
Destroy to build? That's your solution?

811
01:21:40,083 --> 01:21:42,750
Makes sense to me.

812
01:21:52,792 --> 01:21:55,000
Through here.

813
01:21:56,542 --> 01:21:58,083
General.

814
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:01,000
Assault choppers are in the air.

815
01:22:02,417 --> 01:22:03,375
Good.

816
01:22:03,417 --> 01:22:05,250
Make them land.

817
01:22:06,458 --> 01:22:09,292
I won't put this key in this lock...

818
01:22:09,417 --> 01:22:12,667
...until I'm convinced that
there aren't any civilians in this neighborhood.

819
01:22:13,750 --> 01:22:15,625
- Understood?
- Very well, sir.

820
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:54,167
My General, a group just entered the building.

821
01:22:54,292 --> 01:22:55,667
Well, neutralize them.

822
01:22:55,708 --> 01:22:58,167
They aren't armed,
but there are a lot of them.

823
01:22:58,292 --> 01:23:00,042
Continue, I'll handle it.

824
01:23:04,667 --> 01:23:06,625
Go see what's happening.

825
01:23:13,292 --> 01:23:15,708
Go guys.

826
01:24:23,375 --> 01:24:25,125
Montana, I said no destruction.

827
01:24:25,208 --> 01:24:28,167
It's for
my personal security.

828
01:24:33,167 --> 01:24:34,542
What's going on?

829
01:24:35,250 --> 01:24:37,750
Don't worry, the building
is strongly reinforced.

830
01:24:38,417 --> 01:24:39,792
Relax.

831
01:24:46,667 --> 01:24:49,792
This one is mine.

832
01:25:03,208 --> 01:25:05,875
So?
How do you prefer it?

833
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,083
Listen, you don't have...

834
01:25:14,792 --> 01:25:17,083
The rules are to be respected.

835
01:25:17,375 --> 01:25:19,792
But not with people like you.

836
01:25:23,417 --> 01:25:26,500
We love to meet people like you.

837
01:25:28,875 --> 01:25:31,083
And those ears?

838
01:25:33,208 --> 01:25:36,042
You okay?

839
01:25:41,833 --> 01:25:43,750
Strike!

840
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:46,958
I'll call you.

841
01:25:47,375 --> 01:25:50,208
Mr. President, I'm pleased to inform you
that district 13 has been completely evacuated.

842
01:25:52,042 --> 01:25:55,250
How? Just an hour ago we almost...

843
01:25:55,375 --> 01:25:57,250
...weren't able to evacuate a few thousand civilians.

844
01:25:57,333 --> 01:26:00,125
I don't know perhaps the message did not arrive.

845
01:26:00,250 --> 01:26:03,125
In any case, district 13 is empty, I
guarantee it.

846
01:26:10,750 --> 01:26:12,292
In that case.

847
01:26:21,167 --> 01:26:23,875
Get them in position.

848
01:26:25,625 --> 01:26:28,125
Signal received,
attack commencing in one minute.

849
01:26:28,417 --> 01:26:30,250
We are in position,
Mr. President.

850
01:26:47,458 --> 01:26:49,333
Don't move!
Stay put!

851
01:26:49,375 --> 01:26:51,167
I say...!

852
01:26:53,417 --> 01:26:56,333
This is the hand that I'll shove down your throat
if you don't shut up.

853
01:27:01,708 --> 01:27:04,000
Gentlemen, I am the President
of the Republic.

854
01:27:04,458 --> 01:27:08,000
- The one from the television.
- I have seen him on the Internet.

855
01:27:10,292 --> 01:27:12,792
Captain Tomaso,
explain yourself.

856
01:27:13,333 --> 01:27:16,333
Pictures speak louder than words, Mr. President.

857
01:27:27,333 --> 01:27:29,500
- Keep recording.
- what is this?

858
01:27:32,167 --> 01:27:35,000
Don't know, keep recording.

859
01:27:37,292 --> 01:27:38,917
Shit!

860
01:27:39,292 --> 01:27:40,542
What is this?

861
01:27:40,625 --> 01:27:42,250
The DISS in action.

862
01:27:42,292 --> 01:27:44,208
The DISS wanted to
discredit the entire district...

863
01:27:44,292 --> 01:27:47,167
...to destroy it all
and afterwards go back and rebuild.

864
01:27:47,292 --> 01:27:49,792
I'm sure they were compensated for it as well.

865
01:27:51,125 --> 01:27:53,167
If the images
aren't satisfactory...

866
01:27:53,250 --> 01:27:56,250
...I have here a disk of
special operations from the DISS.

867
01:27:57,125 --> 01:27:59,583
Isn't this true, Walter?

868
01:28:01,333 --> 01:28:03,667
It's why they sent him on a vacation.

869
01:28:04,208 --> 01:28:05,583
Nobody move!

870
01:28:05,667 --> 01:28:07,708
What are you doing?

871
01:28:08,375 --> 01:28:10,250
Take out the key.

872
01:28:11,250 --> 01:28:14,000
Take out the key.
Fast.

873
01:28:14,583 --> 01:28:15,917
Let's go!

874
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,208
Take out the key.

875
01:28:18,292 --> 01:28:22,250
Do what I say, remove the key.

876
01:28:23,833 --> 01:28:25,833
What's happening?

877
01:28:27,958 --> 01:28:30,125
There's going to be new elections.

878
01:28:30,250 --> 01:28:33,083
Go, release the
fireworks, turn the key.

879
01:28:33,167 --> 01:28:36,125
Tomaso, do not move!
If you move I'll kill him.

880
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,958
C'mon, turn the key I said!

881
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:52,125
Signal received! Ready!

882
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:53,833
Go.

883
01:28:53,875 --> 01:28:56,042
Stop, Gazman, you'll never get away with this.

884
01:28:56,125 --> 01:28:58,208
A soldier goes on until
the end of the mission.

885
01:28:58,333 --> 01:29:00,292
Even if it
costs him his life.

886
01:29:00,375 --> 01:29:02,250
It's called honor.

887
01:29:02,292 --> 01:29:05,292
That's a concept those people in district 13 have no
notion of.

888
01:29:07,208 --> 01:29:11,708
Yes, we prefer another concept - family.

889
01:29:12,167 --> 01:29:14,167
That's what unites us.

890
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:16,000
It's what protects us.

891
01:29:16,333 --> 01:29:17,542
It's what we believe in.

892
01:29:17,583 --> 01:29:20,250
Unity huh? I think I'm gonna cry.

893
01:29:21,125 --> 01:29:22,417
Then you'll die united.

894
01:29:22,458 --> 01:29:25,083
Enough of this shit, where you going?

895
01:29:25,167 --> 01:29:30,125
Chill, I'm only going to... shit I was
sure that there would be tobacco.

896
01:29:31,292 --> 01:29:32,458
Leave it.

897
01:29:34,125 --> 01:29:35,750
Tomaso!

898
01:29:38,250 --> 01:29:40,667
For my collection.

899
01:30:01,167 --> 01:30:03,875
This is really nice Mr. President.

900
01:30:04,417 --> 01:30:05,917
A gift.

901
01:30:10,042 --> 01:30:11,667
Gentlemen.

902
01:30:14,083 --> 01:30:16,125
Miss, excuse me.

903
01:30:16,958 --> 01:30:20,333
I don't know what to say.

904
01:30:22,125 --> 01:30:24,458
Thank you so much.

905
01:30:26,542 --> 01:30:28,917
I owe you a debt.

906
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:32,125
I believe all of France
owes you a debt.

907
01:30:34,042 --> 01:30:37,417
Well, I don't blame you for not trusting a
politician but...

908
01:30:38,125 --> 01:30:41,083
...I assure you that in
the next 48 hours...

909
01:30:41,208 --> 01:30:44,208
...I will do what I can
to undo these present laws...

910
01:30:45,208 --> 01:30:47,208
...so that this district
can regain...

911
01:30:47,292 --> 01:30:51,042
...its dignity and an important part in
our society.

912
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,625
Thank you.

913
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,125
- I have a question, Mr. President.
- Yes?

914
01:31:00,042 --> 01:31:03,083
Instead of spending a fortune
hiding the rot...

915
01:31:03,208 --> 01:31:05,292
...why not rebuild?

916
01:31:05,375 --> 01:31:07,125
What do you mean?

917
01:31:07,208 --> 01:31:09,375
A true neighborhood.

918
01:31:09,458 --> 01:31:11,083
A true city.

919
01:31:11,167 --> 01:31:13,542
With green spaces
and places to work and play.

920
01:31:14,083 --> 01:31:15,958
I agree.

921
01:31:16,042 --> 01:31:20,833
Damien, I'm appointing you head of this project
until it's finished.

922
01:31:23,625 --> 01:31:25,667
Very well, Mr. President.

923
01:31:26,458 --> 01:31:29,708
You have my word, as well as the government's.

924
01:31:30,083 --> 01:31:32,333
Your word as a man?

925
01:31:33,292 --> 01:31:35,250
My word as a man.

926
01:31:36,708 --> 01:31:38,292
Gentlemen?

927
01:31:38,958 --> 01:31:42,000
- Fine by me.
- Me too.

928
01:31:42,542 --> 01:31:44,083
Yes.

929
01:31:44,125 --> 01:31:45,333
Of course.

930
01:31:45,375 --> 01:31:47,292
Yes.

931
01:31:48,250 --> 01:31:49,708
Very well.

932
01:33:06,250 --> 01:33:09,083
Well, that's better
than mine.

933
01:33:15,167 --> 01:33:18,000
Let's hope everything is for the better.
