1
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,080
First, there was darkness.

2
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,280
Then came the Strangers.

3
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,000
They were a race
as old as time itself.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,560
They had mastered
the ultimate technology--

5
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,680
the ability to alter
physical reality by will alone.

6
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,240
They called this ability
"Tuning."

7
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,120
But they were dying.

8
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,120
Their civilization was
in decline,

9
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,760
and so they abandoned
their world,

10
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,360
seeking a cure
for their own mortality.

11
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,000
Their endless journey brought
them to a small, blue world...

12
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,080
in the farthest corner
of the galaxy.

13
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,480
Our world.

14
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,400
Here, they thought
they had finally found...

15
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,320
what they had been
searching for.

16
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,440
My name is
Dr. Daniel Poe Schreber.

17
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,000
I am just a man.

18
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,720
I help the Strangers
conduct their experiments.

19
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,240
I have betrayed my own kind.

20
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,920
You are confused, aren't you?

21
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,640
Frightened. That's all right.
I can help you.

22
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,240
-Who is this?
-I'm a doctor.

23
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,840
You must listen to me.
You have lost your memory.

24
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,920
There was an experiment.
Something went wrong.

25
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,040
Your memory was erased.
Do you understand me?

26
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,080
No, I don't understand.
What's going on here?

27
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,800
There are people coming for you
as we speak.

28
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,040
Don't let them find you.
Leave now.

29
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,280
Hello? Are you there?

30
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,120
Hey, Mr. Murdoch,
the Automat called.

31
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,560
Said you left your wallet there.

32
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,040
I suggest you retrieve it, since
you only paid for three weeks,

33
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,800
and they was up 10 minutes ago.

34
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,200
I've been here three weeks?

35
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,240
It's right there
in black and white, Mr. Murdoch.

36
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,640
Day and date.

37
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,800
We make our books like we make
our beds, all neat and tidy.

38
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,720
-I'll take care of it later.
-See that you do.

39
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,800
Only thing makes you a guest
in this joint...

40
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,160
is cash on the barrelhead!

41
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,920
House rules.
Three weeks is three weeks.

42
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,400
No days off for good behavior.

43
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,360
Mr. Murdoch, yes?
Where is he?

44
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,720
He just left
not five minutes ago.

45
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,760
Sleep now.

46
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,080
When the rumba rhythm
start to play

47
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,240
Dance with me

48
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,160
Make me sway

49
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,000
Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore

50
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,200
Hold me close

51
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,960
Sway me more

52
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,120
Like a flower bending
in the breeze

53
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,480
Bend with me

54
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,240
Sway with ease

55
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,080
When we dance,
you have a way with me

56
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,480
Stay with me

57
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,960
Sway with me

58
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,600
Hey, sweetie, he said he was
your husband's doctor.

59
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,120
He wanted to speak with you.

60
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,760
Excuse me.

61
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,080
-Doctor...
-Schreber.

62
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,960
Please, won't you come in?
You must be Emma Murdoch.

63
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,560
Thank you for coming to see me
on such short notice.

64
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,000
What is this?

65
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,440
A rather crude experiment
designed to further my studies.

66
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,040
I don't understand. You say
you're my husband's doctor,

67
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,480
but he never
mentioned you to me.

68
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,240
The truth is, John has been
coming to see me...

69
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,680
for quite some time.

70
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,880
He had been grappling
with feelings of betrayal...

71
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,880
stemming from
your marital difficulties.

72
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,760
-John told you what happened.
-Yes.

73
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,280
When was the last time
that you saw him?

74
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,080
Three weeks ago.
He packed a suitcase.

75
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,520
He was very angry at me.

76
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,280
I understand how difficult
this must be for you,

77
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,600
but for John's sake,

78
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,480
I would like you to think of me
as your friend, Emma.

79
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,000
It appears that John
has suffered a psychotic break.

80
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,040
-Complete memory loss.
-You can't be serious.

81
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,920
Oh, but I am.
He may be delusional.

82
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,200
Even violent.

83
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,320
If he were to contact you,
you must call me immediately.

84
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,720
Wherever your husband is,
he is searching...

85
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,520
For himself.

86
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:26,040
Good evening, Mr. Murdoch.
It is Mr. Murdoch, isn't it?

87
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,240
Mr. "J" something Murdoch?

88
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,480
J. Murdoch. What's your name?
Justin? Jerry?

89
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,640
My name's Jason Murdoch.
John Murdoch.

90
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,120
Jake Murdoch. How's it going?
Hi. Jack Murdoch.

91
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,920
Got to get a grip on myself.

92
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,280
I told the guy,
cash on the barrelhead.

93
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,480
I said, "Listen,
three weeks is three weeks."

94
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,920
-Where's our lucky winner?
-Upstairs, sir. Room 614.

95
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,440
The call girl.

96
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,640
-Evening, Husselbeck.
-Inspector Bumstead.

97
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,360
Your lace is untied.

98
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,760
Sorry.

99
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,360
Am I glad you're here, sir.

100
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,920
They say Detective Walenski's
got the heebie-jeebies.

101
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,040
Just take what they give me,
Husselbeck.

102
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,120
-Thanks a lot.
-Excuse me.

103
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,200
-Hello?
-Oh, it's you.

104
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,440
-You left your wallet here.
-When did I do that?

105
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,640
-When you was last here.
-When was that?

106
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,880
When you left your wallet.
Expect me to remember?

107
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,160
-Excuse me!
-No, no, seriously.

108
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,560
-Where you headed, chief?
-Home.

109
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,840
And where's home?

110
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,560
Haven't you mugs got
anything better to do?

111
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,760
I'm just doing my job, May.

112
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,760
There's a killer out there.

113
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,360
Look for him
instead of cooling your heels.

114
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,200
Go on. Get out of here.

115
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,840
Come on.

116
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,600
What's that make so far?
Six hookers in all?

117
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,400
-I believe so, sir.
-Give the man an "A" for effort.

118
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,840
So, Husselbeck,

119
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:54,080
what kind of killer do you think
stops to save a dying fish?

120
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,880
-Got me, sir.
-Bumstead.

121
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,120
What took you? This killer's
been running circles around us,

122
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,200
thanks to Walenski.

123
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,960
With all due respect,
Chief lnspector,

124
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,960
I've known Eddie a long time,
and he's a good cop.

125
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,120
Whatever kind of cop
Walenski once was...

126
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,000
he let drift a long time ago.

127
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,760
Let me talk to Bumstead!

128
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,760
Come on! Hold on!

129
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,520
Frank!

130
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,440
-Get his arm !
-They're watching us!

131
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,640
-On your feet!
-There's no way out!

132
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,640
God, can't you see?

133
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,160
Let me go!
I'm not going to hurt you.

134
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,760
-What was that?
-Walenski.

135
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,840
I'm being punished
for my sins, right?

136
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:49,000
What did I ever do to inherit
this? Where do you begin?

137
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,880
Well, everything Detective
Walenski committed to paper...

138
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,240
should be here, so--

139
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,760
The only thing that should be
committed is Walenski.

140
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,760
Nothing like
a little healthy paranoia.

141
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,280
I came here to file a missing
persons report for my husband.

142
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,560
-Take it to the front desk.
-They told me to come see you.

143
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,360
His name's John Murdoch.

144
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,520
Do these names mean
anything to you?

145
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,200
Who are these women?

146
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,040
Why are you looking
for my husband?

147
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,240
Are you going to accuse him
of something?

148
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,680
-Maybe. Maybe murder.
-Whose murder?

149
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,160
-Which one?
-All of them.

150
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,680
Mrs. Murdoch, I am sorry.
I didn't mean to alarm you.

151
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,360
I'm sorry that I came.
I just made a mistake.

152
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,040
If you'd please just give me
half a second to explain.

153
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,200
We met before?

154
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,760
If we did,
I hope you're still breathing.

155
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,280
What's your name, honey?

156
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,640
Well, that's
an appropriate name.

157
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,480
I was just thinking.

158
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,040
What you do...

159
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:30,040
It seems kind of dangerous...
right now.

160
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,960
How do you know
I'm not the killer?

161
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,080
You don't seem like
the killer type. Why?

162
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,120
You feeling any urges
I should know about?

163
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,840
Shoot.

164
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,240
So it seems you've discovered
your unpleasant nature.

165
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,920
-Who are you?
-We might ask the same question.

166
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,040
Sleep...now.

167
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,720
He can Tune!

168
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,720
What is to be done?
This man is dangerous.

169
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,760
-It is said he is able to Tune.
-Impossible!

170
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,720
We have seen it
with our own eyes.

171
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,480
On occasion, the imprinting
does not take.

172
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,000
They behave erratically
when they awaken.

173
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,520
We find them wandering
like lost children.

174
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,600
But this one was different, yes?

175
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,280
-What has the doctor to say?
-He has failed to report in.

176
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,320
-And Mr. Quick?
-No more Mr. Quick.

177
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,880
Mr. Quick...dead, yes.

178
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,640
Poor, poor Mr. Quick.

179
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,440
Mr. Book...does he know?

180
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,400
Should we not know, Mr. Hand?

181
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,160
We had hoped to learn more
before sharing with you.

182
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,040
We can know nothing
until we possess him.

183
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,200
We must have this man.

184
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,040
My brand, I hope.

185
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,360
I've been worried about you.

186
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,520
Are you punishing me?

187
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,760
If disappearing is
your way of punishing me,

188
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,000
I don't appreciate it.

189
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,120
What are you talking about?

190
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,160
I found these keys in my pocket,
so I assume I live here.

191
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,480
-You supposed to be my wife?
-"Supposed to be"?

192
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,720
You really...don't know
who I am, do you.

193
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,240
Your doctor called me. He was
worried that this might happen.

194
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,480
My doctor?

195
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,840
He gave me his card.
He's desperate to find you.

196
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,200
Feel like I'm living out
someone else's nightmare.

197
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,920
What happened to me?
Why was I seeing a doctor?

198
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,920
I had an affair.

199
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,040
You were angry at me.

200
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,600
Closing time.
The pool is now closed.

201
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,160
Most unfortunate it is...

202
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,400
that we were forced
to seek you out here.

203
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,320
You know how uncomfortable
we find all this moisture.

204
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,320
-I'm sorry. I--
-Failed to report in, yes?

205
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,200
I was frightened.
I have a weak heart, you know.

206
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,600
Your weakness is not, we think,
an affair of the heart.

207
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,240
We found this in his hotel room.

208
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,640
Must we reproduce
Mr. Murdoch's memories again?

209
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,720
I tried to reprint him,
but he woke up.

210
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,840
He knocked the syringe
right out of my hand.

211
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,000
-He has no memories, then?
-Only fragments.

212
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,480
The procedure,
it was interrupted.

213
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,120
I guess it's only a matter
of rounding him up.

214
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,440
You have had strays
before, right?

215
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:10,240
This is no stray, Doctor.
This one can Tune.

216
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,200
But that's impossible.
Only you have that ability.

217
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,440
You will process
another template...

218
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,440
of the subject's memories, yes?

219
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,000
Of course.
I'll imprint him again.

220
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,640
We require them
for a quite different purpose.

221
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,360
It's almost midnight,
Dr. Schreber.

222
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,160
We'll talk again
after tonight's Tuning,

223
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,000
but no more delays, yes?

224
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:35,680
No more inconsistencies
in your behavior.

225
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,040
The police were looking for you.

226
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,120
I know. I saw the papers.

227
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,520
"Killer stalks
city street-walkers."

228
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,240
I was with one of those women.

229
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,960
-Before I came here tonight.
-I don't understand.

230
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:58,720
I met her outside an Automat.
I guess I wanted to test myself.

231
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,680
I wanted to know if I had it
in me to do those things.

232
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,120
Maybe I have lost my mind,

233
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,040
but whoever I am, I'm still me,
and I'm not a killer.

234
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,080
I believe you.

235
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,040
You do?

236
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,320
-What?
-The car outside.

237
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,760
The one you arrived in.

238
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,000
It's a cop.
He dropped me off here.

239
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,760
I didn't know he was still here.

240
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,600
Hold it right there, mister!

241
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,800
-Wait. You have the wrong man.
-Stand aside, will you, please?

242
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,240
I didn't kill anyone.

243
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,480
Right now,
all you are is a suspect.

244
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,640
Turn yourself in. I'll listen
to whatever you have to say.

245
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,640
You won't believe
what I have to say.

246
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,880
-Try me.
-There's someone after me.

247
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,440
It's this group of men.
They want me dead.

248
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,160
And I don't even know if...
they're not even--

249
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,360
Yeah, who's going to listen
to a madman?

250
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,800
-Stand aside, Mrs. Murdoch.
-Run!

251
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,840
No one ever listens to me.

252
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,880
Murdoch, stop!

253
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,240
-How much further?
-We're almost there, buddy.

254
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,880
You happen to know
the way to Shell Beach?

255
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,880
You're kidding! Me and the wife
spent our honeymoon there.

256
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,320
All you do is
take Main Street West to...

257
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,280
Or is it the Cross...
Now, that's funny.

258
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,320
I can't seem to remember
if it's Main Street West...

259
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,600
or the Crosstown.

260
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,040
I'm sorry, lnspector,
I cannot be of more assistance,

261
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,000
but I am running late
for an appointment.

262
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,080
Well, I appreciate you
taking the time.

263
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,760
There's just one thing
that puzzles me.

264
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:50,160
I've met quite a few murderers
in the course of my work.

265
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,800
Murdoch doesn't
strike me as one.

266
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,880
Perhaps you are not accustomed
to digging deep enough.

267
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,680
Well, I do know when
someone is lying to me, Doctor.

268
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,760
Inspector, judging personalities
happens to be my business.

269
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,680
Maybe you can give me
a few pointers.

270
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,520
Certainly.
Let's take you, for instance.

271
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,560
You are a fastidious man.
Driven.

272
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,800
Consumed by details.

273
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,200
I would say
your life is rather lonely.

274
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,720
Good evening, lnspector.
I really must be going.

275
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,960
Come in.

276
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,480
-How is he?
-The same.

277
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,240
Walenski? It's me, Frank.

278
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,520
Come in, Frank.

279
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,800
Close the door.

280
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,680
I've been looking through
some of your old reports.

281
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,760
It's an interesting case.

282
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,920
Kind that make a man's career.

283
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:41,040
-Or break it.
-Yeah. I was on that case.

284
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:44,760
And then what?
What happened then, Eddie?

285
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,160
Nothing happened, Frank.

286
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,080
I've just been spending time
in the subway,

287
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,960
riding in circles.

288
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,400
Thinking in circles.
There's no way out.

289
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,160
I've been over this entire city.

290
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,280
You're scaring your wife
to death, Eddie.

291
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,760
She's not my wife.

292
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,360
I don't know who she is
or who any of us are.

293
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,640
-What makes you say that?
-You think about the past much?

294
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,040
As much as the next guy.

295
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,640
See, I've been trying
to remember things--

296
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,640
clearly remember things
from my past.

297
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,760
But the more
I try to think back,

298
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,720
the more it all starts
to unravel.

299
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,880
None of it seems real.

300
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,880
It's like I've just
been dreaming this life,

301
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,720
and when I finally wake up,
I'll be somebody else,

302
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,640
somebody totally different.

303
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,920
You saw something,
didn't you, Eddie.

304
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,440
Something to do with the case.

305
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,280
There is no case!
There never was!

306
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:56,080
It's all just a big joke!
It's a joke!

307
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,120
Tonight's requirements are...

308
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,280
12 family photo albums,

309
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,680
nine personal diaries,

310
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,760
17 love letters,

311
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,120
assorted childhood photographs,

312
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:51,160
requisite false l.D.s
and social security cards.

313
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,400
These do bring back memories.

314
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,840
This one is still warm.

315
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,680
What is it?

316
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,800
The recollections of
a great lover?

317
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,040
A catalogue of conquests?

318
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,160
We will soon find out.

319
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,840
You wouldn't
appreciate that,

320
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,960
would you,
Mr. Whatever-your-name is?

321
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,120
Not the sort of conquest
you would ever understand.

322
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,120
Let's see.

323
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,960
A touch of
unhappy childhood...

324
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,880
A dash of
teenage rebellion...

325
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,320
And last but not least...

326
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,840
a tragic death
in the family.

327
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,160
Mr. Book.

328
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,320
Why does Murdoch not sleep
during the Tuning?

329
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:56,440
Maybe he's a step up
the evolutionary ladder.

330
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,680
A freak of nature.

331
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,440
He's adapting to survive.
What do you expect?

332
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,320
Weren't you looking for
the human soul?

333
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,880
Isn't that the purpose
of your little zoo?

334
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:08,120
That's why you change people
and things every night.

335
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,880
Maybe you have finally
found what you are looking for,

336
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,440
and it's going to bite you
on your--

337
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,160
It requires several
of your lifetimes...

338
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,800
to master our gifts.

339
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,560
The idea that
a simple man...

340
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,520
could develop the ability
to Tune is--

341
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,640
Absurd, I know.

342
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,880
What other explanation is there?

343
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,760
It is time.

344
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,240
Shut it down.

345
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,960
Fredrickson says he'll take me
off the night shift.

346
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,760
It's about time, dear.

347
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,440
Hello?

348
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,680
Wake up.

349
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,120
Wake up!

350
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,840
Can anyone hear me?

351
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,600
Let the Tuning commence.

352
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,200
The Goodwins.

353
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,160
Charlie, Sylvia,

354
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,240
Jane, and little Matthew.

355
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,080
Jane and little Matthew.

356
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,160
The rich get richer.

357
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,200
Probably have
maid's quarters...

358
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,560
before the night
is through.

359
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,840
Dr. Schreber, I presume.

360
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,320
It's you.

361
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,360
Hey, come on.

362
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,440
That's no way to greet
a patient, Doctor,

363
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,520
if that's what you are.

364
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,920
Please, l--

365
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,720
Why is everyone asleep?

366
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,040
Please keep your voice down.

367
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,920
I can't remember anything.
What have you done?

368
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,640
Nothing. I want to help you.

369
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,960
We cannot talk here.
If they see us together--

370
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,760
I don't care.
I want some answers. Now!

371
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,800
Who are they?
Why are they trying to kill me?

372
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,920
Answer me!

373
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,800
My God.

374
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,800
-You really can do it.
-I did that?

375
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,360
Listen to me.
You have their power.

376
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,280
You can make things happen
by will alone.

377
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,800
They call it "Tuning."

378
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,720
That is how they change
the buildings.

379
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,200
Just now you acted
out of self-defense,

380
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,920
but I can teach you
to control your power.

381
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,760
We can stop them.
We can take the city back.

382
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,400
My glasses.

383
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,680
He made a terrible impression
for the firm,

384
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,440
Iollygagging around
as he did.

385
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,200
So I told Fredrickson
I was letting him go.

386
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,200
Well you should have, darling.

387
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,800
He attacked me.
I don't know where he's gone.

388
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,080
Come, Dr. Schreber.
We have much to do.

389
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,600
-Yes?
-Yes.

390
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:32,080
They say that
you're a runaround lover

391
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:40,840
Though you say it isn't so

392
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:50,160
But if you put me down
for another

393
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:57,360
I'll know, believe me, I'll know

394
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,160
Tonight's experiment will
take place in these locations.

395
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:06,040
The first subject
shall be imprinted on Avenue M.

396
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,960
Mr. Book, there is a problem.

397
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,520
There is no Avenue M.

398
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,400
We were unable
to complete it.

399
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,760
During the last Tuning,
we detected a lack of control.

400
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,880
An opposing influence
on the machines?

401
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,000
This man Murdoch is
more powerful than we thought.

402
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,920
He is becoming like us.

403
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:28,240
So we must become like him.

404
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,360
The doctor has done as we asked?

405
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,960
The life and times
of John Murdoch, volume two.

406
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,360
We must not do this.

407
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,640
Murdoch does not possess
these memories, yes?

408
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,400
How will his imprint
allow us to find him?

409
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,720
Everywhere he goes,
everyone he seeks out...

410
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,960
will be known to us.

411
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,920
And as he follows the clues,
so shall we follow the memories.

412
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,280
But to imprint one of us?

413
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,960
Failure has always resulted.

414
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,360
What Mr. Hand proposes
is our only option.

415
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,960
Imprint.

416
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,000
This may sting a bit.

417
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,640
Is it done?

418
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,000
Oh, yes, Mr. Book.

419
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,720
I have John Murdoch in mind.

420
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,880
"Johnny...

421
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:00,760
"Found this postcard
among your mother's things.

422
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,000
"Brings back memories,
doesn't it?

423
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,760
"Stop by sometime.

424
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,960
"We'll see if we can't
hook ourselves another mermaid.

425
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,200
"Love to Emma. Karl."

426
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,440
Karl.

427
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,840
Karl Harris.

428
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,680
Harris.

429
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,560
Excuse me.
Which way is Avenue C?

430
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,800
Try the subway.

431
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,800
You got a problem, pal?

432
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,560
Been working here long?

433
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,800
25 years.
No days off for good behavior.

434
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,680
We're looking for John Murdoch.

435
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,560
She knows nothing,
Mr. Hand.

436
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,360
A dead end, Mr. Wall.

437
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,040
We thought his imprint
would let us track him.

438
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,480
But instead
we have been brought here.

439
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:04,400
-This is irrational.
-Instincts are irrational.

440
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:07,600
We must follow
where they lead, yes?

441
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:10,760
Mr. Sleep suggests he may go
to places familiar.

442
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,080
His job.

443
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,080
He does not care about our job.

444
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,800
Indulge us, Mr. Hand.

445
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:19,400
If you were Murdoch, yes?

446
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,640
If I were Murdoch...

447
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:27,720
I would remember how
my wife had hurt me...

448
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,760
by sleeping with another man.

449
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,680
And then...

450
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,800
I would look for a way
to hurt her in return.

451
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:45,040
Leave me alone with her.
There's work to be done.

452
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,600
All change,
platform three.

453
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,240
All change?

454
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,520
Excuse me, how do I get
to the end of the line?

455
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,960
You want the Express.

456
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,360
How come the train didn't stop?

457
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,640
That's the Express.

458
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,960
There's no way out.

459
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,680
You can't get out of the city.
I've tried.

460
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,760
You're Murdoch, aren't you?

461
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,400
The one
they've been looking for.

462
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,520
You're not a killer.

463
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,160
They set you up with
a fake identity,

464
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,760
Iike everyone else here.

465
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,680
-Who are you?
-I was a cop.

466
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,720
At least in this life I was.

467
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,440
They steal peoples' memories.

468
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,240
Then they swap them around
between us.

469
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,840
I seen them do it,
back and forth...

470
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,920
till no one knows
who they are anymore.

471
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,200
How do you know all this?

472
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,960
Once in a while one of us
wakes up...

473
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,360
while they're changing things.

474
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,680
It's not supposed to happen,
but it does.

475
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,000
It happened to me.

476
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,440
They'll come looking for you.

477
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,800
Just like they'll come
looking for me.

478
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,200
But that's OK.

479
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,360
I figured a way out.

480
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,560
They were here.

481
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:16,920
Last night.

482
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,080
This was to be his home.

483
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,360
That was when we loved her.

484
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,640
This is all well and good,

485
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,600
but we require
a more practical link...

486
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,600
to his present whereabouts.

487
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,040
And I know where to find her.

488
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:47,280
We're very lucky,
when you think about it.

489
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,280
I'm sorry?

490
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,320
To be able to revisit
those places...

491
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,240
which meant
so very much to us.

492
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,480
I thought we were haunted
by them.

493
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,200
Perhaps.

494
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,600
There used to be a ferry
when I was a boy.

495
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,640
Biggest thing you ever saw.

496
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,400
Lit up like
a floating birthday cake.

497
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:08,160
That's just what my husband
once said to me.

498
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,680
On this very spot.

499
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,120
Where is your husband now?

500
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:16,840
I wish I knew.
What brings you here?

501
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:19,600
I met my wife at this place.

502
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,800
It's where I met my husband.

503
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,280
Small world.

504
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,200
Hello?

505
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,400
What are you doing here?

506
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,000
I've been following you.

507
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,140
Hold it right there!

508
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:14,100
Johnny?

509
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:18,340
It's been so damn long,

510
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:20,420
I thought you'd forgotten
your Uncle Karl.

511
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:22,940
You son of a gun!

512
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:27,380
Uncle Karl...

513
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:31,300
Wait.

514
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:36,100
-Is that me?
-Yeah.

515
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:45,700
Shell Beach is where
I grew up?

516
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:48,260
That's what I said.
Shell Beach.

517
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:50,660
-Your home town.
-I need to get there.

518
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:51,700
How do I get there?

519
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:55,860
I don't know.
I haven't been there in years.

520
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:58,660
You must remember.
You must have some idea.

521
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:01,700
Sorry, Johnny.

522
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,540
The old cracker barrel
ain't what it used to be.

523
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:12,500
-It was so bright there.
-Brighter times, I guess.

524
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:17,340
You were always scribbling
in that damn book.

525
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:19,260
That's me and your Pa.

526
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:21,540
What a couple of
handsome fools.

527
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:23,060
What happened to my parents?

528
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:26,580
Where are they now?

529
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:29,500
They're dead, Johnny.

530
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:32,180
They died when the house
burned down.

531
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:33,780
I looked after you.

532
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:36,340
You don't remember that,
really?

533
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:41,460
What's that? What is that?

534
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:48,860
It's a scar.

535
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:51,100
You burned your arm pretty bad
in the fire.

536
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:57,940
What does it mean?

537
00:50:57,980 --> 00:50:59,900
It means these are all lies!

538
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:06,020
My husband told me
he'd been here.

539
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:08,740
He told me he wanted
to test himself.

540
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:10,980
See if he was...

541
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:13,300
capable of...

542
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:23,580
I wanted to talk to her.

543
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:25,500
I thought she could
help me find him.

544
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:29,060
I'm going to call the station.

545
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:45,700
It's beautiful.

546
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:50,980
It was a gift from my mother.

547
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:52,540
She died recently.

548
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:56,060
I keep it with me
to remind me of her.

549
00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:59,100
I'm sorry.

550
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,660
It's a funny thing, though.

551
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:07,060
I can't remember
when she gave it to me.

552
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:11,740
How do you think I could
forget a thing like that?

553
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:15,540
What's happening, lnspector?

554
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:17,300
I'm not sure I know anymore.

555
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:22,820
I left your old room
like it was.

556
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:25,980
You can sleep here tonight.

557
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:28,060
Glad to have you back, Johnny.

558
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:30,740
-Even if it is for just a night.
-Karl.

559
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:34,340
-Is that the right time?
-Why, sure.

560
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:36,740
That clock's kept perfect time
since I bought it.

561
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:38,020
A.M. or P.M.?

562
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:41,980
-What do you think?
-I don't understand.

563
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:44,660
How can it be night already?
What happened to the day?

564
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:47,100
You're tired.
Anything's possible.

565
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:49,660
Get some sleep.

566
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:52,060
We'll straighten all this out
tomorrow.

567
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:24,060
Come on...

568
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:46,500
He's here.
He's acting peculiar.

569
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:48,820
I know. He's not himself.

570
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:50,820
Keep him there,
and I'll be right over.

571
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:53,020
-I'll try.
-Thanks. Bye.

572
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:59,660
I can't promise anything.
We'll play it as it comes.

573
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:03,100
We just wanted to help.

574
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:13,020
Karl. Uncle Karl.

575
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:16,380
If you're in trouble,
maybe we can do something.

576
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:20,180
Haven't seen you in so long.

577
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:36,180
Mr. Murdoch, you've been
the cause of much distress.

578
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:43,100
-Start talking.
-There's no need for this.

579
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:46,580
There's no escape.
The city's ours. We made it.

580
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:47,900
What are you talking about?

581
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:50,900
We fashioned this city
on stolen memories.

582
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:54,540
Different eras, different pasts,
all rolled into one.

583
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:58,460
Each night we revise it,
refine it, in order to learn.

584
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:01,420
-Learn what?
-About you.

585
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:05,660
You and your fellow inhabitants.
What makes you human.

586
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:09,060
-Why?
-We need to be like you.

587
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:11,900
I understand you now.

588
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:15,380
I remember that which you do
not, what you've been missing.

589
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:20,700
The ocean, yes? Running along
the waves as a child.

590
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:25,100
Meeting Emma at the river,
that first kiss that followed.

591
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:29,020
-What are you?
-You've seen what we are.

592
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:31,540
We use your dead as vessels.

593
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:36,860
Get in!

594
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:55,460
-What about her? Ring a bell?
-She was alive when I left her.

595
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:58,420
-What about this?
-This is nothing.

596
00:58:58,460 --> 00:59:00,580
It must mean something--
all those pictures.

597
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:01,580
What pictures?

598
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:05,740
-I don't understand this.
-Stop playing games with me.

599
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:08,140
-Stop telling me lies.
-I am not telling lies!

600
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:10,420
Help me out.
Make me understand.

601
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:15,220
I have this jigsaw puzzle in
my face, and it makes no sense.

602
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:18,460
You think it makes sense to me?
I'm as confused as you are.

603
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:22,260
Let me ask you a question.
Have you heard of Shell Beach?

604
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:24,340
-Sure.
-You know how to get there?

605
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:25,980
-Yeah.
-Tell me.

606
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:31,580
-Right. You just go to the...
-Where? Where do you go?

607
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:33,180
Give me a second, will you?

608
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:36,580
You can't remember, can you?

609
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:40,340
Thinking that's kind of odd?

610
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:43,500
Wait. I got a better one.

611
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:47,140
When was the last time you
did something during the day?

612
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:50,580
-What do you mean?
-I just mean during the day.

613
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:54,380
Daylight. When was the last
time you remember seeing it?

614
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:57,980
I'm not talking about a distant,
half-forgotten childhood memory.

615
00:59:58,020 --> 01:00:00,660
I mean, like, yesterday.
Last week? When?

616
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:03,260
Do you have a single memory?

617
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:06,620
You don't, do you?

618
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:11,980
I don't think the sun
even exists in this place.

619
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:16,060
'Cause I've been up for hours
and hours, and night never ends.

620
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:18,780
-That's crazy.
-You're damn right it's crazy.

621
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:22,300
But listen to me, Bumstead.
It's not just me.

622
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:25,100
It's all of us. They're doing
something to all of us.

623
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:26,940
Shut up.
I've heard enough.

624
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:29,580
-Please listen--
-Shut up!

625
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:42,300
There has to be an explanation.

626
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:50,300
Explain this.

627
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:12,700
I'm so sorry.

628
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:16,540
I never meant to hurt you.
I don't know why I did.

629
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:18,300
I wish I could take it back.

630
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:21,180
You didn't do it.

631
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:22,820
This affair of yours,

632
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:25,820
whatever you think you've done,
you didn't do it.

633
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:26,980
I don't believe it happened.

634
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:30,660
-What do you mean?
-This will sound crazy.

635
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:33,700
What if we never knew
each other before now?

636
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:39,740
What if the first time we met
was last night in our apartment?

637
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:42,380
And everything you remember,

638
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:45,500
and everything I'm supposed to
remember never really happened.

639
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:47,900
Someone just wants us
to think it did.

640
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:50,300
But how can that be true?

641
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:53,740
I so vividly remember
meeting you.

642
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:57,260
I remember falling in love
with you.

643
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:01,660
-I remember losing you.
-Time's up.

644
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:07,740
No, wait, please.
Just one more minute.

645
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,420
I love you, John.

646
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:20,780
You can't fake something
like that.

647
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:23,820
No, you can't.

648
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:54,340
Inspector? Sir?

649
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:58,300
Detective Walenski
killed himself last night.

650
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:01,900
I thought you should know.

651
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:08,580
The chief wanted to see you.
Sir?

652
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:17,020
I knew you'd track
the killer down.

653
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:33,020
Shoelace.

654
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:48,700
-How can we help you, sir?
-You can sleep.

655
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:53,580
Sleep. Sleep.

656
01:03:57,220 --> 01:03:58,340
Evening.

657
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:14,140
I wanted to be the first to
congratulate you about the case.

658
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:19,300
Take us to Murdoch.

659
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:20,300
Sleep.

660
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:51,100
I knew you'd come eventually.

661
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:53,540
Isn't it time
you gave me some answers?

662
01:04:54,820 --> 01:04:57,420
Yes, of course.
Won't you please sit down?

663
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:02,340
I come here often.

664
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:04,860
It's one of the few places
I'm allowed some peace.

665
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:08,220
You see, they have
an aversion to water.

666
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:11,100
One could almost call it
a phobia.

667
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:14,020
Who are they?
What do they want from me?

668
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:15,020
Right.

669
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:20,260
For now, let's say you're
the subject of their experiment.

670
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:21,700
We all are.

671
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:28,900
I'm sorry, but I have no time
to do this the right way.

672
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:32,740
Everything you need to know
is in this syringe.

673
01:05:32,780 --> 01:05:36,220
I need you to inject yourself.
It's the only way to understand.

674
01:05:36,260 --> 01:05:38,980
-You're kidding, right?
-We're running out of time!

675
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:42,500
-You have to do this now.
-Give me the gun.

676
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:44,580
He's more disturbed
than we thought.

677
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:47,420
I may not be the judge
of personality you are,

678
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:50,300
but you're the one
who looks disturbed.

679
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:52,740
You don't know what
you're doing.

680
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:57,660
What exactly is in this, Doctor?

681
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:02,300
All the answers you've been
looking for, I swear to you.

682
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:09,700
Guess I'll hold on to it for
safekeeping, if you don't mind.

683
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:10,980
Let's go, Doctor.

684
01:06:12,460 --> 01:06:15,500
Go? Where are we going?

685
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:17,580
Shell Beach.

686
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:21,980
That's where you wanted to go,
isn't it, the ocean?

687
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:33,700
Won't find anything there.
I've been there--

688
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:35,980
Then you can show us the way.

689
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:39,580
I won't. I refuse.
You can't make me go there.

690
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:41,900
Don't you understand?
They'll be waiting for us.

691
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:55,140
I don't understand.
There used to be a bridge here.

692
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:03,260
Try that again, and your friends
will find you in the canal.

693
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:05,020
Don't hurt me.
I'll tell you everything.

694
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:06,700
It doesn't matter anymore
anyway.

695
01:07:13,340 --> 01:07:14,300
What?

696
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:18,980
Who are you people?

697
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:22,060
Must go to the end
of the canal.

698
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:25,860
We will give you some more
pretty things soon...

699
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:29,220
-Anna.
-I'm not Anna.

700
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:32,740
You will be soon, yes.

701
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:39,580
I have another use
for her first.

702
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:50,500
I call them Strangers.

703
01:07:51,020 --> 01:07:53,420
They abducted us
and brought us here.

704
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:58,820
This city, everyone in it...
is their experiment.

705
01:07:58,820 --> 01:08:01,420
They mix and match our memories
as they see fit,

706
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:03,980
trying to divine
what makes us unique.

707
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:07,180
One day, a man might be
an inspector.

708
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:09,900
The next,
someone entirely different.

709
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:13,580
When they want to study
a murderer, for instance,

710
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:17,900
they simply imprint one of their
citizens with a new personality.

711
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:22,020
Arrange a family for him,
friends, an entire history...

712
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:23,820
even a lost wallet.

713
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:25,900
Then they observe the results.

714
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:31,140
Will a man, given the history of
a killer, continue in that vein?

715
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:35,020
Or are we, in fact, more than
the sum of our memories?

716
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:39,460
This business of you being
a killer was a sad coincidence.

717
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:42,540
You have had dozens of lives
before now.

718
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:43,980
You happened to wake up...

719
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:46,700
while I was imprinting you
with this one.

720
01:08:46,780 --> 01:08:48,620
Why are they doing all this?

721
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:52,700
It is our capacity for
individuality, our souls...

722
01:08:52,740 --> 01:08:54,500
that makes us different
from them.

723
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:56,900
They think they'll find
the human soul...

724
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:59,500
if they understand
how our memories work.

725
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:03,820
They have collective memories.
They share one group mind.

726
01:09:03,820 --> 01:09:08,540
They're dying. Their race is
on the brink of extinction.

727
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:11,460
-They think we can save them.
-Where do I fit in?

728
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:15,820
You're different. You resisted
my attempt to imprint you.

729
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:23,900
Somehow, you have developed
their ability to Tune.

730
01:09:23,940 --> 01:09:27,020
That is how they change things,
how they built this city.

731
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:29,860
They have machines buried
beneath the surface...

732
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:33,260
that allow them to focus
their telepathic energies.

733
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:36,540
They control everything here,
even the sun.

734
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:39,620
That's why it's always dark.
They can't stand the light.

735
01:09:39,660 --> 01:09:41,060
Why do they need you?

736
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:42,980
When they first brought us here,

737
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:47,140
they extracted what was in us
and stored the information,

738
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:49,020
remixed it like paint...

739
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:51,460
and gave us back
new memories of their choosing.

740
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:54,980
But they still needed an artist
to help them.

741
01:09:56,620 --> 01:10:01,420
I understood the human mind
better than they ever could,

742
01:10:01,420 --> 01:10:04,900
so they allowed me to keep
my skills as a scientist...

743
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:06,340
because they needed them.

744
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:08,700
They made me delete
everything else.

745
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:21,220
Can you imagine what it's like
to erase your own past?

746
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:24,380
What about my past?
What about my childhood?

747
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:27,180
Shell Beach. Uncle Karl.

748
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:32,300
What about this?
This was blank when I found it.

749
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:36,060
You still don't understand.
You were never a boy.

750
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:37,340
Not in this place.

751
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:40,140
Your history is an illusion,
a fabrication,

752
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:41,900
as it is with all of us.

753
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:44,380
You made those drawings happen
with your gift.

754
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:45,860
You say they brought us here.

755
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:49,100
From where?

756
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:55,820
I'm sorry. I don't remember.

757
01:10:56,620 --> 01:11:00,700
None of us remember that...
what we once were...

758
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:04,140
what we might have been...
somewhere else.

759
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:24,820
I've taken you this far.
You don't need me anymore.

760
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:25,780
Let's go.

761
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:11,500
There is no ocean, John.

762
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:14,780
There's nothing beyond the city.

763
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:18,740
The only place home exists...

764
01:12:20,860 --> 01:12:22,380
is in your head.

765
01:12:33,340 --> 01:12:34,300
Stop!

766
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:47,820
Please!

767
01:13:07,820 --> 01:13:09,860
Now you know the truth.

768
01:14:06,980 --> 01:14:09,540
You'll allow yourself
to surrender...

769
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:11,780
or it will result in
this one's death.

770
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:12,980
What do I care?

771
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:15,420
She's not my real wife.
She's nothing to me.

772
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:19,940
But you do still care,
don't you, Mr. Murdoch?

773
01:14:19,980 --> 01:14:24,060
I have become the monster
you were intended to be.

774
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:29,340
Shall I end her life now,
as you would have?

775
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:37,820
-Don't hurt her, please.
-Then surrender.

776
01:14:39,940 --> 01:14:40,860
Sleep.

777
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:43,860
Now.

778
01:15:02,380 --> 01:15:03,340
Sleep.

779
01:15:12,020 --> 01:15:13,340
Kill him.

780
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:14,340
Kill him !

781
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:27,780
He is powerful, yes, dangerous.

782
01:15:27,820 --> 01:15:31,020
But he can also lead us
to what we seek...

783
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:34,100
what the doctor calls the soul.

784
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:37,940
It is time for our experiment
to move into a final phase.

785
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:40,660
We no longer need
the other subjects.

786
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:43,940
The time for study is over.

787
01:15:43,940 --> 01:15:48,100
It is time to be one
with John Murdoch.

788
01:15:54,660 --> 01:15:57,860
It is time, Doctor. Imprint.

789
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:02,500
Shut it down!

790
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:05,700
Shut it down forever.

791
01:16:19,740 --> 01:16:20,780
What are you doing?

792
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:26,180
They want to imprint you with
their own collective memories.

793
01:16:27,220 --> 01:16:29,340
They want to make you
one of them...

794
01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:31,460
so they can share your soul.

795
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:33,740
But I've got other plans.

796
01:16:36,980 --> 01:16:39,740
Imprint, Doctor.
No more disobedience.

797
01:16:39,780 --> 01:16:44,220
I'm sorry. The pain will
only last a moment.

798
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:56,540
Remember, John.

799
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:59,460
You'll rise to greater heights
than that.

800
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:01,860
One day when you're older,
you'll understand.

801
01:17:03,140 --> 01:17:04,060
Remember.

802
01:17:05,380 --> 01:17:08,100
That's it, John.
Practice makes perfect.

803
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:11,260
Now, remember what I told you.
Never talk to strangers.

804
01:17:11,620 --> 01:17:12,900
John, remember.

805
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:15,780
You're probably wondering why I
keep appearing in your memories.

806
01:17:15,820 --> 01:17:18,140
It's because I have
inserted myself in them.

807
01:17:18,180 --> 01:17:21,980
They were fabricated to
teach you about the Strangers.

808
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:25,020
Give you a lifetime of knowledge
in a single syringe.

809
01:17:27,740 --> 01:17:32,220
You will survive, John. You'll
find strength within yourself.

810
01:17:32,260 --> 01:17:33,740
And you will prevail.

811
01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:35,460
Remember.

812
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:38,300
-Hi, Uncle Karl.
-Johnny!

813
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:45,060
Getting the hang of it, John.
Maybe one day I'll work for you.

814
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:49,140
Here's the machine the Strangers
use to amplify their thoughts,

815
01:17:49,180 --> 01:17:50,860
the machine that changes
their world.

816
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:54,020
You must take control of it.
You must make the machine yours.

817
01:17:54,060 --> 01:17:58,460
I know you can beat them,
but you must concentrate.

818
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:01,580
Something's wrong.

819
01:18:10,020 --> 01:18:11,820
There is no time for romance.

820
01:18:11,860 --> 01:18:13,860
The world can be
what you make it.

821
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:15,860
What have you done?

822
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:18,940
You have the power
to make anything happen...

823
01:18:19,020 --> 01:18:20,860
but you must act now.

824
01:22:53,540 --> 01:22:57,620
I knew you could do it, John.
You have their power now.

825
01:22:57,700 --> 01:22:59,860
-You control their machines.
-Where's Emma?

826
01:23:00,940 --> 01:23:05,260
She's not Emma anymore.
She has been reimprinted.

827
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:07,460
-So give her back her memories.
-I can't.

828
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:11,380
The facility where they stored
the memories has been destroyed.

829
01:23:12,140 --> 01:23:13,100
I'm sorry.

830
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:16,340
What are you going to do now?

831
01:23:19,220 --> 01:23:20,660
I'm gonna fix things.

832
01:23:22,220 --> 01:23:25,420
You told me I had the power,
didn't you?

833
01:23:26,340 --> 01:23:29,140
I can make these machines
do anything I want.

834
01:23:30,180 --> 01:23:32,140
Make this world
anything I want it to be.

835
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:37,220
Just so long as I concentrate
hard enough.

836
01:24:57,420 --> 01:24:58,660
Where are you going?

837
01:25:01,940 --> 01:25:02,900
Shell Beach.

838
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:44,020
-What's the fare?
-A quarter.

839
01:25:50,540 --> 01:25:52,180
-Please.
-Oh, no, sit.

840
01:25:53,420 --> 01:25:54,380
Thank you.

841
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:40,420
Been waiting for you, yes?

842
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:45,220
-What are you doing?
-I'm just making a few changes.

843
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:49,940
-We're sure that's what we want?
-I'll take my chances.

844
01:26:50,020 --> 01:26:55,540
I'm dying, John. Your imprint
is not agreeable with my kind.

845
01:26:55,620 --> 01:26:57,700
But I wanted to know
what it was like.

846
01:26:59,340 --> 01:27:00,900
How you feel.

847
01:27:00,980 --> 01:27:03,540
You know how I was
supposed to feel.

848
01:27:03,540 --> 01:27:07,500
That person isn't me.
Never was.

849
01:27:07,540 --> 01:27:10,580
You wanted to know what it was
that makes us human.

850
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:15,300
Well, you're not going to
find it in here.

851
01:27:16,820 --> 01:27:18,580
You went looking
in the wrong place.

852
01:28:53,740 --> 01:28:55,460
It's so beautiful here.

853
01:29:00,660 --> 01:29:01,900
So bright.

854
01:29:07,940 --> 01:29:09,900
Do you know if Shell Beach
is around here?

855
01:29:10,580 --> 01:29:12,900
I think that's it over there.

856
01:29:30,380 --> 01:29:32,300
I'm headed that way myself.

857
01:29:34,220 --> 01:29:35,500
Would you like to join me?

858
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:39,460
Sure.

859
01:29:44,660 --> 01:29:48,100
I'm Anna, by the way.
What's your name?
