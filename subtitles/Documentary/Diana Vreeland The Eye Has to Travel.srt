1
00:00:19,736 --> 00:00:24,554
It is not the horror of landmines
that is making a headline back home.

2
00:00:24,663 --> 00:00:28,279
Reports of the Princess' romance with
Dodi Fayed...

3
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:33,553
Speculations fueled by the arrival last night...

4
00:02:47,623 --> 00:02:51,832
Diana, Princess of Wales, has been formally separated from her husband,

5
00:02:51,952 --> 00:02:54,706
Prince Charles for nearly three years.

6
00:02:54,826 --> 00:02:56,226
Diana!

7
00:02:56,346 --> 00:02:58,246
Diana!
-Diana!

8
00:02:58,788 --> 00:03:00,933
Di!
Di!

9
00:03:00,986 --> 00:03:03,654
Diana, this way!
-Over here!

10
00:03:03,774 --> 00:03:06,138
Over here, Di!

11
00:03:17,975 --> 00:03:20,144
Looks like the check's in the post.

12
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:33,297
This way, Princess.

13
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,732
Over here!

14
00:03:34,767 --> 00:03:36,516
Di!

15
00:03:36,636 --> 00:03:38,468
Are you getting a divorce?

16
00:03:38,783 --> 00:03:41,311
Di, are you getting a divorce?

17
00:03:41,431 --> 00:03:44,040
Di, are you getting a divorce?

18
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,057
Thanks.

19
00:04:39,132 --> 00:04:42,010
It's been a long week,
you must all be very tired.

20
00:04:42,045 --> 00:04:44,162
Go home.
And thank you.

21
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:48,224
Where would you like to supper,
Your Royal Highness?

22
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:51,330
I don't want anything, everyone can go home.
Thank you.

23
00:05:41,428 --> 00:05:43,096
So yes i...

24
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:46,748
I did infict on myself.

25
00:05:48,317 --> 00:05:50,584
I didn't like myself.

26
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:57,392
I was ashamed that i couldn't cope
with the pressures.

27
00:05:57,782 --> 00:06:01,764
So, i just hurt my arms.

28
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,633
So i just hurt my arms
and my legs.

29
00:06:11,478 --> 00:06:14,818
There were 3 of us in this marriage.

30
00:06:15,326 --> 00:06:17,285
So it's a bit crowded.

31
00:06:21,636 --> 00:06:25,508
The most persistent critism
is that as the marriage broke down...

32
00:06:25,616 --> 00:06:27,599
You were unfaithful
to your wife.

33
00:06:29,285 --> 00:06:32,169
That's a persistent critism, is it?

34
00:06:34,388 --> 00:06:37,208
That's a persistent critism, is it?

35
00:07:10,866 --> 00:07:12,952
And open your eyes.

36
00:07:17,345 --> 00:07:18,715
Would you like a pin?

37
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,029
Hmm...

38
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,785
It keeps coming back.

39
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,562
That dream i told you about.

40
00:07:25,607 --> 00:07:27,253
Falling into darkness?

41
00:07:27,299 --> 00:07:29,130
It's not falling.

42
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,841
It's being dropped.

43
00:07:32,177 --> 00:07:34,680
Someone's doing it to me.

44
00:07:35,261 --> 00:07:37,192
And take a breath.

45
00:07:39,985 --> 00:07:41,976
I think perhaps you're afraid
of letting go.

46
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:43,699
No.

47
00:07:43,745 --> 00:07:47,408
I hang on to things,
like my marriage.

48
00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:49,633
You're a cancerian.

49
00:07:50,114 --> 00:07:52,698
You hang on to the idea of love.

50
00:07:53,215 --> 00:07:55,786
Cause you're so good
at giving love.

51
00:07:56,094 --> 00:07:57,773
So you keep on giving.

52
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,801
The hard part is receiving love.

53
00:08:00,921 --> 00:08:04,658
But if i can't receive it,
i'm back where it started.

54
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,544
And where is that?

55
00:08:07,704 --> 00:08:09,337
On the doorstep.

56
00:08:09,374 --> 00:08:12,879
A little girl waiting for her mother to return.

57
00:08:14,033 --> 00:08:18,117
Perhaps that little girl should finally stand up
and walk into the garden.

58
00:08:18,393 --> 00:08:21,121
It's been 30 years.

59
00:08:22,245 --> 00:08:25,586
In your dream,
who's pushing you?

60
00:08:26,218 --> 00:08:28,662
It's not the point, Oonagh.

61
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:30,808
The point is...

62
00:08:32,237 --> 00:08:34,283
Will anyone catch me?

63
00:08:51,486 --> 00:08:53,503
Just use the same...

64
00:08:59,764 --> 00:09:01,418
Right then.

65
00:09:05,049 --> 00:09:08,047
I suppose it's too late
to back out now.

66
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:23,932
It's fine, Wills.
Just take care not to shoot any carcass.

67
00:09:24,809 --> 00:09:26,804
I'll see you next weekend.

68
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:29,415
The one after.

69
00:09:30,995 --> 00:09:33,744
If that's what the palace
have decided...

70
00:09:34,143 --> 00:09:36,799
No, it's fine with me.
As long as you're happy.

71
00:09:39,563 --> 00:09:41,362
I miss you too.

72
00:09:43,387 --> 00:09:44,809
I'm at the opera.

73
00:09:45,048 --> 00:09:46,637
Having a great time.

74
00:09:48,753 --> 00:09:50,175
I love you.

75
00:09:52,677 --> 00:09:54,179
Bye, darling.

76
00:09:57,658 --> 00:09:58,971
There's something coming up.

77
00:09:58,992 --> 00:10:01,633
A nuclear submarine
needs to be named.

78
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:04,071
I've indicated to the palace
you might be willing to do it.

79
00:10:04,093 --> 00:10:07,089
Perhaps you can indicate to the palace
that i'd like to see my children.

80
00:10:07,096 --> 00:10:08,990
More than once
every 5 weeks.

81
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:12,349
The submarine, i think in the current situation
it'll be sensible.

82
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:15,817
A nuclear submarine?
I want to help people.

83
00:10:15,838 --> 00:10:18,682
It's still possible
you might be queen one day.

84
00:10:18,725 --> 00:10:22,062
Like it or not, you're going to have
an army and navy who will be helping people...

85
00:10:22,099 --> 00:10:23,774
By...
-Shut up!

86
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,292
Sorry, Patrick.

87
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,556
Your Royal Highness,
there's a call from Oonagh.

88
00:11:03,599 --> 00:11:05,043
She said it's urgent.

89
00:11:09,223 --> 00:11:11,689
Excuse me, intensive care?

90
00:11:11,877 --> 00:11:14,789
Second floor on the right.
-Thank you.

91
00:11:39,549 --> 00:11:40,867
He had a hemorrhage.

92
00:11:41,063 --> 00:11:43,645
It sometimes happens
with bypass operations.

93
00:11:51,189 --> 00:11:52,338
Mrs. Toffollo.

94
00:11:52,382 --> 00:11:53,513
Doctor.

95
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:55,385
This is Diana.

96
00:11:58,481 --> 00:12:00,911
Joseph's condition is still
very serious.

97
00:12:01,031 --> 00:12:03,756
I need your permission to take him back
this afternoon.

98
00:12:04,075 --> 00:12:05,257
Of course.

99
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,438
Do please look after him.

100
00:12:10,728 --> 00:12:12,367
He is very precious.

101
00:12:18,535 --> 00:12:20,443
He's going to be alright.

102
00:12:20,653 --> 00:12:21,872
Yes.

103
00:12:22,663 --> 00:12:24,933
That man knows what he's doing,
don't you think?

104
00:13:02,638 --> 00:13:04,698
Are you going down?
-Yes.

105
00:13:06,236 --> 00:13:07,670
Thanks, i was...

106
00:13:07,866 --> 00:13:10,695
Just think Joseph's so much better.

107
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:14,050
Mr Toffollo is not on that floor.

108
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,842
Right.

109
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:17,903
Yes, i got lost and...

110
00:13:18,023 --> 00:13:20,130
You know, went a bit wrong.

111
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:24,904
Actually, i didn't get lost.
I was snooping.

112
00:13:25,024 --> 00:13:27,247
Hospitals fascinate me.

113
00:13:27,796 --> 00:13:29,341
Are you being serious?

114
00:13:29,537 --> 00:13:30,383
Yes.

115
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:33,517
When i visit hospitals,
i get excited.

116
00:13:33,637 --> 00:13:36,843
I feel like i can make
a contribution.

117
00:13:36,963 --> 00:13:38,751
Perhaps i can show you around.

118
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:40,949
I would adore that.

119
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,472
I don't know
how to contact you.

120
00:13:46,081 --> 00:13:49,058
Well, i'm like most people.
I've got a mobile.

121
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,349
Actually, i'm not like most people.
I have 4.

122
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:54,728
One number would do.

123
00:13:55,766 --> 00:13:59,905
And 11.00 an audience with His Grace,
The Archbishop of Canterbury.

124
00:14:00,025 --> 00:14:02,270
13.00...
-Paul!

125
00:14:03,947 --> 00:14:06,166
Lunch with Clyde James.

126
00:14:06,449 --> 00:14:09,941
15.00 briefing here at KP
with doctors from Broadmol.

127
00:14:10,061 --> 00:14:11,711
On patient therapy.

128
00:14:13,605 --> 00:14:14,853
Thank you, Paul.

129
00:14:16,202 --> 00:14:17,871
And one last thing, ma'am.

130
00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:28,129
There's been a rumor,
you've done an interview with BBC.

131
00:14:28,151 --> 00:14:30,829
Yes, don't worry about that, Patrick.

132
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:32,556
Everything will be alright.

133
00:14:43,099 --> 00:14:46,048
This is the Reginald Wilson Ward,
retains private rooms.

134
00:14:46,077 --> 00:14:47,861
The NHS is on this side.

135
00:14:47,897 --> 00:14:50,052
Basically we're about 50/50.

136
00:14:51,751 --> 00:14:53,325
Is your father a doctor?

137
00:14:53,383 --> 00:14:55,298
No, he runs the family business.

138
00:14:55,349 --> 00:14:56,972
He plants bottles.

139
00:14:57,161 --> 00:14:59,272
But i do have an uncle
who's a heart surgeon.

140
00:15:00,925 --> 00:15:03,087
So you followed him.

141
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:04,763
I follow no one.

142
00:15:06,881 --> 00:15:08,257
But yes, i admit.

143
00:15:08,315 --> 00:15:10,469
My uncle did help
to set me on my path.

144
00:15:10,803 --> 00:15:12,508
Family can be useful.

145
00:15:12,862 --> 00:15:15,060
And bloody irritating.

146
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:18,395
Perhaps i've been luckier with my family
than you have.

147
00:15:18,642 --> 00:15:20,107
I don't know.

148
00:15:20,227 --> 00:15:22,320
I've got two families.

149
00:15:22,523 --> 00:15:24,022
How lucky is that?

150
00:15:26,837 --> 00:15:28,969
This is pretty much
state of the art.

151
00:15:30,091 --> 00:15:32,246
How long a heart operation
go on?

152
00:15:32,366 --> 00:15:34,628
Sometimes 8 to 9 hours.

153
00:15:35,187 --> 00:15:37,508
God, how do you keep going?

154
00:15:37,628 --> 00:15:41,293
You reach a place inside youself
where time has no meaning.

155
00:15:42,185 --> 00:15:44,216
You don't perform the operation...

156
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:46,910
The operation performs you.

157
00:15:48,027 --> 00:15:49,717
I'd love to feel that.

158
00:15:49,754 --> 00:15:51,365
And when it's over...

159
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,933
Reality is a bit flat.

160
00:15:54,129 --> 00:15:55,500
And you're very tired.

161
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,938
I bet.

162
00:16:02,326 --> 00:16:04,653
This is the on-call accomodation.

163
00:16:06,887 --> 00:16:09,252
You just crash here?

164
00:16:10,057 --> 00:16:11,232
What do you eat?

165
00:16:11,283 --> 00:16:14,170
There's a canteen on teh ground floor,
but it's not open late.

166
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,639
You can always pop around the corner
for supper with me.

167
00:16:21,593 --> 00:16:22,928
I'm serious.

168
00:16:23,167 --> 00:16:25,546
The palace, we stay open very late.

169
00:16:27,516 --> 00:16:30,309
Sonya, are you sure this is the right stuff?

170
00:16:30,345 --> 00:16:31,933
He's a heart surgeon, right?

171
00:16:32,099 --> 00:16:33,398
He'd be a healthy eater.

172
00:16:33,441 --> 00:16:36,550
I've got this.

173
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,436
Aren't they harder to cook?

174
00:16:38,463 --> 00:16:40,549
You boil and drain,
8 minutes.

175
00:16:40,603 --> 00:16:43,888
I'll do everything else,
you just stuff it in the microwave.

176
00:16:45,228 --> 00:16:48,237
Are you sure he's not married
or something?

177
00:16:48,302 --> 00:16:50,326
No, i've checked him out.

178
00:16:50,616 --> 00:16:53,801
So what is it that you like
about this man?

179
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,465
He doesn't treat me
like a princess.

180
00:16:56,531 --> 00:16:58,787
It's almost as if
he doesn't know who i am.

181
00:16:59,011 --> 00:16:59,976
Maybe he doesn't.

182
00:17:00,096 --> 00:17:01,826
He might be very badly informed.

183
00:17:12,503 --> 00:17:14,447
Can we be of an assistance, sir?

184
00:17:14,476 --> 00:17:15,572
Yes.

185
00:17:15,692 --> 00:17:16,733
Cheers.

186
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:17,922
Cheers.

187
00:17:22,254 --> 00:17:23,509
Are you working tomorrow?

188
00:17:23,524 --> 00:17:24,735
Not at the hospital.

189
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:27,943
I'm writing a paper from Monday morning,
it's part of my thesis.

190
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,924
I have to be home by midnight.

191
00:17:31,114 --> 00:17:32,789
How do you relax?

192
00:17:32,992 --> 00:17:35,132
Doing such a stressful job?

193
00:17:35,205 --> 00:17:36,654
I listen to jazz.

194
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,274
I'm not sure
i like jazz.

195
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,572
You should go to Ronny Scott's.

196
00:17:44,506 --> 00:17:47,873
I can't just go places,
you know.

197
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,959
It's not the same
listening to records.

198
00:17:50,575 --> 00:17:52,436
Jazz is in the moment.

199
00:17:52,523 --> 00:17:55,549
You have to be there, it's improvise.
Just like life.

200
00:17:55,563 --> 00:17:58,022
My life is completely
regimented.

201
00:17:58,051 --> 00:18:00,670
You mean you're told where to go
and who to shake hands with?

202
00:18:00,684 --> 00:18:01,925
Exactly.

203
00:18:01,961 --> 00:18:04,565
But within that framework,
you improvise.

204
00:18:04,609 --> 00:18:07,917
You look at someone for a clue
as how to start a conversation.

205
00:18:08,156 --> 00:18:10,213
And you let it flow
from there.

206
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,933
You improvise all the time.

207
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,625
And if you can improvise...

208
00:18:15,857 --> 00:18:17,242
You like jazz.

209
00:18:17,953 --> 00:18:19,897
I've got to check
on the supper.

210
00:18:21,848 --> 00:18:24,119
Pretty hot stuff, eh?
-What?

211
00:18:25,917 --> 00:18:27,890
You in the kitchen.

212
00:18:28,673 --> 00:18:29,943
Yes, hot stuff.

213
00:18:29,964 --> 00:18:31,610
You can say that.

214
00:18:33,787 --> 00:18:34,853
Hot stuff...

215
00:19:08,092 --> 00:19:10,725
So hearts can't actually
be broken?

216
00:19:10,979 --> 00:19:14,155
A heart can receive a shock so violence
it never recovers.

217
00:19:14,275 --> 00:19:16,948
Yes, but can they actually break?

218
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:19,967
My colleagues might disagree...

219
00:19:19,996 --> 00:19:24,218
But i believe for instance that Maria Carlos
died of a broken heart.

220
00:19:27,939 --> 00:19:29,919
You don't like my food.

221
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:31,813
No.

222
00:19:32,502 --> 00:19:33,953
No, it's lovely.

223
00:19:34,134 --> 00:19:35,423
You're obviously very good.

224
00:19:35,543 --> 00:19:37,208
Come on.

225
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:40,175
What kind of food
do you really like?

226
00:19:42,687 --> 00:19:45,407
You couldn't make me
a hamburger, could you?

227
00:19:46,221 --> 00:19:50,030
I'm not sure you can actually make hamburgers.

228
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:51,818
Oh dear.

229
00:19:54,256 --> 00:19:55,960
I could send out for one.

230
00:20:06,751 --> 00:20:07,963
Very good.

231
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:11,322
Yes, i can see.

232
00:20:14,526 --> 00:20:15,911
Do you mind?

233
00:20:16,354 --> 00:20:17,260
No.

234
00:20:19,287 --> 00:20:21,898
I bet you give your patients lectures
about that.

235
00:20:21,956 --> 00:20:24,104
About what?
-Smoking.

236
00:20:24,387 --> 00:20:25,381
Of course.

237
00:20:25,417 --> 00:20:27,122
But you don't lecture yourself.

238
00:20:27,165 --> 00:20:28,960
I'm not the patient,
i'm the doctor.

239
00:20:28,981 --> 00:20:31,578
You still have to look after yourself.

240
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:34,837
Tonight you turned down a healthy supper
for fast food.

241
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:38,123
You've drunk a fair amount of wine
and now you're smoking.

242
00:20:40,995 --> 00:20:42,736
Is there anymore wine?

243
00:20:43,026 --> 00:20:44,512
Or have we run out?

244
00:20:45,985 --> 00:20:48,734
This is a palace,
we don't run out.

245
00:20:58,358 --> 00:21:00,825
I didn't think you'd have a television.

246
00:21:00,869 --> 00:21:03,241
Of course, i love telly.

247
00:21:03,277 --> 00:21:04,524
What do you watch?

248
00:21:04,553 --> 00:21:05,504
Everything.

249
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:07,363
Series and stuff.

250
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:11,660
My favorite is Casualty.
It was on tonight, so i videod it.

251
00:21:14,634 --> 00:21:15,527
What?

252
00:21:19,303 --> 00:21:21,298
They're defending too deep.

253
00:21:21,592 --> 00:21:22,622
really?

254
00:21:22,644 --> 00:21:25,183
Come on, push up!
Push up!

255
00:21:26,126 --> 00:21:27,967
See, that's what happens.

256
00:21:29,012 --> 00:21:33,156
You can't give Liverpool that much space to plan,
they'll walk right through you.

257
00:21:36,819 --> 00:21:38,829
Who are the blue ones?

258
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,579
I don't think i should drive home.

259
00:21:49,811 --> 00:21:51,937
Well, the tube is still running.

260
00:21:52,057 --> 00:21:54,959
But if i leave my car here,
it'll be sold for scrap.

261
00:21:55,046 --> 00:21:56,838
I was joking.

262
00:21:56,874 --> 00:21:58,850
I already called
for a driver.

263
00:21:58,887 --> 00:22:00,577
The service here
is rather good.

264
00:22:00,606 --> 00:22:03,725
We should really have horsedrawn carriages
at the ready.

265
00:22:04,025 --> 00:22:05,614
The full Windsor experience.

266
00:22:05,635 --> 00:22:07,427
I'm used to horsedrawn carriages.

267
00:22:07,449 --> 00:22:09,196
I were driven to school in them.

268
00:22:09,233 --> 00:22:11,641
Pakistan?
-Yes.

269
00:22:11,761 --> 00:22:13,940
Freezing cold,
huddled under blankets.

270
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:18,431
My friends and i, we would breathe the cold air out
and pretend we were smoking.

271
00:22:19,642 --> 00:22:22,036
That's where the bad habits started.

272
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:24,284
I don't have any bad habits.

273
00:22:25,585 --> 00:22:27,616
How do i get out?

274
00:22:28,356 --> 00:22:30,978
The paratroopers are waiting
for you outside.

275
00:22:31,098 --> 00:22:32,876
They drag you to the tower of London.

276
00:22:32,905 --> 00:22:35,836
Where the Prince of Wales will personally
interogate you.

277
00:22:35,886 --> 00:22:38,745
WIth his favorite set up of midevial
torturing lines.

278
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:39,855
Yes.

279
00:22:39,876 --> 00:22:42,089
Yes, i was going to ask
about him.

280
00:22:42,147 --> 00:22:43,757
Don't you read the papers?

281
00:22:43,772 --> 00:22:45,847
Not those bits, sorry.

282
00:22:46,224 --> 00:22:48,511
I'm glad somebody doesn't.

283
00:22:48,939 --> 00:22:50,912
Charles and i
live separate lives.

284
00:22:50,934 --> 00:22:53,188
So it's alright me coming here?

285
00:22:53,308 --> 00:22:54,704
More than alright.

286
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:57,527
I'll call you soon,
if you like.

287
00:22:58,369 --> 00:22:59,449
Yes.

288
00:23:00,807 --> 00:23:02,983
Yes, i would like that.

289
00:23:08,981 --> 00:23:10,555
Good night.

290
00:23:11,585 --> 00:23:13,272
Good night.

291
00:23:13,744 --> 00:23:15,238
Wonderful cooking.

292
00:23:24,012 --> 00:23:27,088
There's no one theme called jazz, right?

293
00:23:27,132 --> 00:23:28,721
So when he says he likes jazz...

294
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,657
That's like saying, i like food.

295
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:33,699
People who like different kinds of jazz
come to blows.

296
00:23:33,742 --> 00:23:37,957
It's very weird, from an intense young man.

297
00:23:37,993 --> 00:23:40,169
He's so young.

298
00:23:40,177 --> 00:23:41,344
Right, so.

299
00:23:41,707 --> 00:23:43,913
Choose something, anything.

300
00:23:46,104 --> 00:23:48,388
Good, yeah.
Stick it on.

301
00:23:59,152 --> 00:24:01,154
You have to sit and listen.

302
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:03,964
You can't chatter through it,
they're very hard on that.

303
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,458
Sit.

304
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:09,354
Sit and listen.

305
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,067
Diana.

306
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:56,612
Surprise.

307
00:24:57,606 --> 00:24:59,166
What are you doing here?

308
00:24:59,401 --> 00:25:00,917
I couldn't sleep.

309
00:25:01,265 --> 00:25:03,536
I thought i'd come to see
if i could help.

310
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:07,352
It's wonderful to see you,
but i don't think that's a good idea.

311
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:08,578
Right.

312
00:25:08,672 --> 00:25:10,453
So bugger off, basically.

313
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,607
In the nicest possible way.

314
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,138
That's alright,
i'm good at that.

315
00:25:15,174 --> 00:25:16,415
Had a lot of practice.

316
00:25:16,422 --> 00:25:17,895
It's been mad in here.

317
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,171
I was actually going to call you tomorrow.

318
00:25:26,619 --> 00:25:27,388
Stop it.

319
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:28,187
Diana, just...

320
00:25:28,223 --> 00:25:29,391
You can't do this to me.

321
00:25:29,406 --> 00:25:31,176
Just one more, seriously.

322
00:25:31,205 --> 00:25:32,896
I know you.
News of the World.

323
00:25:32,918 --> 00:25:33,890
You've got a good memory.

324
00:25:33,933 --> 00:25:35,486
Yes, i remember the ones
i don't like.

325
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,741
And i don't do them many favors.

326
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,294
Clive, I'll call you back.

327
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,835
Clive, it's Diana.
This is out of order.

328
00:25:42,524 --> 00:25:44,665
I come here to visit the terminally ill...

329
00:25:44,716 --> 00:25:47,509
People who need to someone
to sit with them through the night.

330
00:25:48,444 --> 00:25:51,455
Yes, and i'm allow to do this
in privacy.

331
00:25:57,493 --> 00:26:00,039
No there isn't going to be a divorce.

332
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:03,470
Will you please follow the rules?

333
00:26:05,174 --> 00:26:06,038
Good.

334
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:09,919
It's official, no more pictures.

335
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:11,716
Good night.

336
00:26:16,363 --> 00:26:17,749
Shit.

337
00:26:32,078 --> 00:26:35,857
I do a job that requires me
to be very focus.

338
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:38,941
It's not going to be possible
for you and i to go out together.

339
00:26:39,061 --> 00:26:43,457
To a restaurant anywhere,
there would be millions of people swarming all over us.

340
00:26:44,001 --> 00:26:46,909
That maybe your life,
but it can't be mine.

341
00:26:47,722 --> 00:26:49,862
That's pretty clear, then.

342
00:26:51,871 --> 00:26:54,350
I'm sorry, i think you're wonderful.

343
00:27:00,642 --> 00:27:02,369
If there was a way.

344
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,986
I'd take it.

345
00:27:21,549 --> 00:27:22,753
Yes?

346
00:27:23,311 --> 00:27:24,291
Do i know you?

347
00:27:24,313 --> 00:27:26,779
I'm the girl you're gonna ask on a date.

348
00:27:44,289 --> 00:27:45,971
Beautiful.

349
00:27:47,911 --> 00:27:49,434
Gorgeous.

350
00:28:00,307 --> 00:28:02,018
You should have been here last week.

351
00:28:02,046 --> 00:28:04,203
Somebody should have been here
last week.

352
00:28:04,323 --> 00:28:07,271
We had bouncers on the door
throwing people in.

353
00:28:07,314 --> 00:28:10,707
The boy turned up with 25 people,
We offered him a partnership.

354
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,940
Is the fucking mike on?

355
00:28:21,323 --> 00:28:22,308
Thank you, madam.

356
00:28:22,428 --> 00:28:26,953
It's always nice to meet someone who's been allowed out of the dark for the first time.

357
00:28:27,073 --> 00:28:30,214
But, now i'm delighted to introduce
a young act...

358
00:28:30,243 --> 00:28:33,537
That's been making a big impression
on the London scene.

359
00:28:33,573 --> 00:28:36,971
The Dwayne Johnson Quartet.

360
00:29:43,634 --> 00:29:44,777
Hello?

361
00:29:46,192 --> 00:29:47,608
Where are you?

362
00:29:49,564 --> 00:29:51,562
Don't apologize.

363
00:29:51,576 --> 00:29:54,682
Saving lives is a bit
more important.

364
00:29:56,407 --> 00:29:59,280
You know how to show a girl
a good time.

365
00:30:04,388 --> 00:30:06,839
Listen, Hasnat.

366
00:30:07,543 --> 00:30:09,354
I'd love to do that, but...

367
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,673
The next few days are going to be a little bit tricky.

368
00:30:13,787 --> 00:30:15,255
No, i cant...

369
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:18,151
Just, watch your TV.

370
00:30:45,926 --> 00:30:47,624
Thank you, sir.

371
00:30:47,828 --> 00:30:49,348
Cheers.

372
00:30:52,181 --> 00:30:54,919
Yes, i did inflict upon myself.

373
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,553
I didn't like myself.

374
00:30:56,581 --> 00:30:59,954
I was ashamed that i couldn't
cope with the pressures.

375
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:01,788
What did you actually do?

376
00:31:02,209 --> 00:31:06,114
I just hurt my arms
and my legs.

377
00:31:06,977 --> 00:31:12,057
Do you think Mrs Parker Bowles
was a factor in the break down of your marriage?

378
00:31:13,028 --> 00:31:16,068
Well, there were 3 of us in this marriage.

379
00:31:16,139 --> 00:31:18,159
So it's a bit crowded.

380
00:31:18,979 --> 00:31:21,566
What evidence that you have that...

381
00:31:21,837 --> 00:31:24,099
Their relationship
is continuing?

382
00:31:24,219 --> 00:31:25,662
Although you were married?

383
00:31:30,468 --> 00:31:34,084
By the change in behavioral pattern
in my husband...

384
00:31:34,819 --> 00:31:39,408
For all sort of reasons that a woman's instinct produces.

385
00:31:39,793 --> 00:31:42,188
You just know.

386
00:31:42,509 --> 00:31:45,934
Do you think
you will ever be queen?

387
00:31:46,291 --> 00:31:48,867
I'd like to be queen of people's hearts.

388
00:31:48,924 --> 00:31:50,815
In people's hearts.

389
00:31:51,222 --> 00:31:54,884
And i don't see myself as being queen of this country.

390
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,332
I don't think many people
want me to be queen.

391
00:31:57,346 --> 00:31:59,625
Because they've decided that...

392
00:31:59,903 --> 00:32:01,594
I'm a non starter.

393
00:32:01,616 --> 00:32:03,899
Why do you think they've decided that?

394
00:32:07,535 --> 00:32:10,382
Because i do things differently.

395
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,659
Cause i don't go by rule book.

396
00:32:12,702 --> 00:32:14,599
Cause i lead from the heart...

397
00:32:14,642 --> 00:32:17,418
Not the head, and all be it,
that's what got me into trouble in my work.

398
00:32:17,432 --> 00:32:19,830
I understand that, but...

399
00:32:21,204 --> 00:32:25,374
Someone's gotta go out there
and love people and show it.

400
00:32:28,656 --> 00:32:31,297
I sit here with hope
cause there's a future i heard.

401
00:32:31,326 --> 00:32:34,639
A future for my husband,
a future for myself.

402
00:32:34,668 --> 00:32:36,922
And the future for the monarchy.

403
00:32:37,194 --> 00:32:38,949
Your Royal Highness, thank you.

404
00:32:41,233 --> 00:32:42,853
That's not good, right?

405
00:32:42,874 --> 00:32:44,401
I suppose it does.

406
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:09,887
So, what have we got?

407
00:33:09,945 --> 00:33:12,436
These are the transcripts of the
LBC early morning phone-in.

408
00:33:12,465 --> 00:33:14,399
The women are very strong for you.

409
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,762
The men about 50/50.

410
00:33:15,783 --> 00:33:19,341
Yes, i've analyzed the TV pundets,
and that transcara...

411
00:33:21,503 --> 00:33:22,645
Please.

412
00:33:26,464 --> 00:33:28,248
Good morning, Patrick.

413
00:33:31,898 --> 00:33:34,411
I suggest you show the tape to a lawyer.

414
00:33:34,531 --> 00:33:37,658
I offered to open up a formal dialogue,
with Buck house.

415
00:33:37,694 --> 00:33:43,027
I begged you to give me a preview so we could build some firewall
before the shelling began.

416
00:33:44,177 --> 00:33:47,388
You keep telling me everything's going to be alright.

417
00:33:48,494 --> 00:33:50,313
But it's not alright,
it's all wrong.

418
00:33:50,327 --> 00:33:53,510
I've been trying to reopen doors
and you've shut them.

419
00:33:54,101 --> 00:33:56,570
Personally, i have been place in an invidious position.

420
00:33:56,598 --> 00:33:59,253
I have no alternative but
to offer my resignation.

421
00:34:00,546 --> 00:34:04,224
And since i haven't the faintest idea
how to manage this that you have created...

422
00:34:04,266 --> 00:34:07,102
I would like that resignation to have
an immediate effect.

423
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:11,424
Well Patrick, you've been a rock.

424
00:34:16,386 --> 00:34:17,913
What will you do?

425
00:34:19,676 --> 00:34:21,414
Get a new rock.

426
00:34:26,977 --> 00:34:28,297
Hello?

427
00:34:29,032 --> 00:34:31,051
Yes, tell me what you thought.

428
00:34:33,236 --> 00:34:34,627
I see.

429
00:34:42,047 --> 00:34:44,895
Sonya, so what do you think?

430
00:34:50,859 --> 00:34:52,643
I'll call you back later.

431
00:35:46,521 --> 00:35:48,951
Everyone thinks i screwed up.

432
00:35:51,727 --> 00:35:53,509
I had to hit back.

433
00:35:53,766 --> 00:35:57,277
Hitting back is a short term tactic,
what was your strategy?

434
00:35:58,083 --> 00:35:59,825
I don't think i do strategy.

435
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:03,516
If your intention was to avoid a divorce,
you've achieved the opposite.

436
00:36:05,115 --> 00:36:07,081
My parents divorced.

437
00:36:07,188 --> 00:36:10,770
I made a vow to myself never put my children
throught the same thing.

438
00:36:10,841 --> 00:36:13,581
So why would you do something
so drastic?

439
00:36:14,573 --> 00:36:17,133
My boys need to see me happy.

440
00:36:19,281 --> 00:36:20,616
It's time.

441
00:36:21,318 --> 00:36:22,895
I have to move on.

442
00:36:22,938 --> 00:36:24,865
So you didn't screw up.

443
00:36:26,406 --> 00:36:28,623
Because now you'll be free.

444
00:36:34,191 --> 00:36:36,267
Here, cover yourself with this blanket.

445
00:36:36,303 --> 00:36:37,626
And lie down in the back.

446
00:36:37,647 --> 00:36:40,138
That way the security guards
don't know more about my life than i do.

447
00:36:40,173 --> 00:36:41,842
You've done this before?

448
00:36:41,884 --> 00:36:44,211
Mind your own business.

449
00:36:49,572 --> 00:36:51,056
Suspension's very low.

450
00:36:51,092 --> 00:36:52,558
Explosive device?

451
00:36:52,593 --> 00:36:54,163
Nah, too bulky.

452
00:36:54,391 --> 00:36:56,664
Looking about 8 kilos there.

453
00:36:59,076 --> 00:37:01,152
That'll be a Pakistani heart surgeon then.

454
00:37:04,587 --> 00:37:06,317
I think we fooled them.

455
00:37:07,487 --> 00:37:09,007
Were you alright in there?

456
00:37:09,021 --> 00:37:10,313
Breathing was impossible.

457
00:37:10,334 --> 00:37:13,089
Come on, that's just a detail.

458
00:37:57,401 --> 00:37:59,273
I love feeling your hand there.

459
00:38:06,054 --> 00:38:08,716
That day when i fist saw you.

460
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,165
So powerful.

461
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:14,200
Don't think i've been so strucked
by someone.

462
00:38:14,254 --> 00:38:15,761
What do you mean?

463
00:38:16,587 --> 00:38:18,064
It's like...

464
00:38:19,376 --> 00:38:21,931
Nothing could distract you.

465
00:38:22,788 --> 00:38:26,445
You're just doing your job
without any sense of self.

466
00:38:26,874 --> 00:38:28,175
I'm a doctor.

467
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:30,290
Yes, i know but...

468
00:38:32,593 --> 00:38:35,769
I can see how much love
you put into it.

469
00:38:36,174 --> 00:38:38,080
Love is a garden.

470
00:38:39,357 --> 00:38:44,106
If you can't smell the fragrance,
don't come into the garden of love.

471
00:38:45,754 --> 00:38:48,172
Who said that?
-Rumi.

472
00:38:49,335 --> 00:38:51,072
Persian poet.

473
00:38:51,783 --> 00:38:53,773
13th century.

474
00:38:55,058 --> 00:38:56,945
Garden of love.

475
00:38:59,416 --> 00:39:00,772
I like that.

476
00:39:09,819 --> 00:39:14,305
One year later.

477
00:39:42,394 --> 00:39:43,725
What happened here?

478
00:39:47,907 --> 00:39:49,906
She stepped on a mine.

479
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,444
She was pregnant.

480
00:39:51,458 --> 00:39:54,272
Did she lose the baby?

481
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,705
Yes.

482
00:39:55,949 --> 00:39:57,844
Cause of that problem.

483
00:40:06,357 --> 00:40:07,847
She's Alena.

484
00:40:07,882 --> 00:40:09,317
How old is she?

485
00:40:09,352 --> 00:40:10,627
Seven.

486
00:40:10,869 --> 00:40:14,603
She went out to fetch water
and stood on a landmine.

487
00:40:14,825 --> 00:40:18,031
Her intestines were blown out
of her body.

488
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:04,534
Ma'am...

489
00:41:04,903 --> 00:41:09,634
A government minister at home reported you a loose cannon,
for supporting this campaign.

490
00:41:09,669 --> 00:41:11,222
Do you have any reaction?

491
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:15,702
I'm merely trying to highlight a problem
that's going on all around the world.

492
00:41:16,044 --> 00:41:20,083
It's been said though that you're aligning yourself with labor party policy.

493
00:41:20,089 --> 00:41:21,620
Do you think that's wise?

494
00:41:21,662 --> 00:41:24,211
Labor? I don't know what...

495
00:41:24,225 --> 00:41:25,740
I don't know what you're talking about.

496
00:41:25,747 --> 00:41:28,722
This is a humanitarian mission.

497
00:41:39,261 --> 00:41:42,819
It's enough to make me burst into tears that...

498
00:41:44,792 --> 00:41:46,867
Who said i'm a loose cannon?

499
00:41:48,358 --> 00:41:49,945
Mr Wonderful, come in.

500
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:52,634
Mr Wonderful, this is Diana calling.

501
00:41:52,675 --> 00:41:54,250
My darling, they're attacking you.

502
00:41:54,312 --> 00:41:56,456
Somebody in the house
is calling you...

503
00:41:56,498 --> 00:41:58,595
A loose cannon, yes i know.

504
00:41:58,978 --> 00:42:03,389
But did they print the pictures of the kids
with all their arms and legs blown off?

505
00:42:03,598 --> 00:42:06,904
No, they're making it looked like a routine
hospital visit.

506
00:42:07,865 --> 00:42:09,147
Bastards.

507
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,894
What shall i do?

508
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:13,468
Use your power.

509
00:42:13,545 --> 00:42:15,586
You're the most famous woman in the world.

510
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,919
You don't have to follow Royal Family Rules anymore.
You're divorced.

511
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:21,991
So think differently,
improvise.

512
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:23,407
Alright.

513
00:42:25,078 --> 00:42:26,708
Improvise.

514
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:35,098
Clear.

515
00:42:45,908 --> 00:42:48,304
I have to do this by myself.

516
00:42:48,855 --> 00:42:51,862
If i go with you, it gives them a chance to belittle me.

517
00:42:51,897 --> 00:42:55,427
Okay, keep to the path,
no veering left or right.

518
00:42:56,033 --> 00:42:57,190
Yeah?

519
00:42:59,697 --> 00:43:01,102
Alright.

520
00:43:02,154 --> 00:43:03,617
Good luck.

521
00:43:31,685 --> 00:43:34,701
What's all the fuss?
They did this field already.

522
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:38,438
An family worker was killed
three months ago.

523
00:43:42,841 --> 00:43:44,429
Three weeks ago...

524
00:43:44,694 --> 00:43:47,257
That walk would've been impossible.

525
00:43:47,305 --> 00:43:50,175
I'd been blown up many times over.

526
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:54,097
Soon, all this land
can be farmed again.

527
00:43:54,111 --> 00:43:56,662
And children play in the fields.

528
00:43:56,711 --> 00:44:01,072
But clearance is a lengthly
and hazzardous process.

529
00:44:01,192 --> 00:44:04,519
Humanity's only defense
against landmines.

530
00:44:04,546 --> 00:44:07,256
Is to stop manufacturing...

531
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:10,170
Thank you.

532
00:44:10,656 --> 00:44:13,191
Something's coming, fellas.
Is it?

533
00:44:36,425 --> 00:44:38,285
Thank you Charlie.

534
00:45:21,788 --> 00:45:24,066
God, i miss you so much.

535
00:45:38,122 --> 00:45:40,023
My beautiful...

536
00:45:42,083 --> 00:45:43,838
I'm so proud of you.

537
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:45,301
You did it.

538
00:45:46,681 --> 00:45:48,694
It's all down to you.

539
00:45:48,826 --> 00:45:50,101
No.

540
00:45:52,604 --> 00:45:55,460
Why do smokers always smoke
after sex?

541
00:45:57,024 --> 00:45:58,487
After the greatest pleasure in life...

542
00:45:58,521 --> 00:46:01,189
It's only natural to reach out
for the second greatest.

543
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:03,901
You should give up,
you of all people should know that.

544
00:46:03,942 --> 00:46:05,607
Some people are exempt.

545
00:46:05,914 --> 00:46:08,838
Bollocks.
-Some people lead a charmed life, and i'm one of them.

546
00:46:08,887 --> 00:46:12,224
Walter Walt 22 carrats bollocks.

547
00:46:12,279 --> 00:46:14,007
And i lead a charmed life.

548
00:46:14,028 --> 00:46:15,823
No, i'm an expert
and you're not.

549
00:46:15,844 --> 00:46:17,716
I'm an expert
on everything.

550
00:46:17,751 --> 00:46:22,614
I know about fashion, polo, criminal psychology,
the internal combustion engine...

551
00:46:22,635 --> 00:46:23,275
Rubbish.

552
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:24,822
It's all part of my job.

553
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:26,351
embroidery...

554
00:46:26,386 --> 00:46:29,277
Nuclear submarines...

555
00:46:29,318 --> 00:46:32,344
Not an A level to my name,
and i'm... What's that word...

556
00:46:32,393 --> 00:46:34,315
I'm an om... omnipast?

557
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:35,235
omniscient?

558
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,983
Yes, i even knew that.

559
00:46:37,025 --> 00:46:39,171
I've seen and done everything,
much more than you.

560
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:41,734
You're just a specialist,
and i'm...

561
00:46:42,006 --> 00:46:42,982
What's that word?

562
00:46:43,037 --> 00:46:44,570
Shut up.

563
00:46:44,932 --> 00:46:48,587
Multiple choice,
is it dilettante, polymath...

564
00:46:48,964 --> 00:46:50,338
Or ectomorph?

565
00:46:50,805 --> 00:46:52,700
You're laughing at me.

566
00:46:52,728 --> 00:46:54,546
You can't even speak proper English.

567
00:46:54,579 --> 00:46:55,777
I don't have to,
i'm not English.

568
00:46:55,798 --> 00:46:58,032
You're so smug.

569
00:46:58,157 --> 00:47:01,863
All you know about is football
and jazz.

570
00:47:02,211 --> 00:47:03,547
And...

571
00:47:04,306 --> 00:47:05,894
Saving people's lives.

572
00:47:05,929 --> 00:47:07,697
Saving lives.

573
00:47:08,282 --> 00:47:11,068
That wasn't on your list, Miss polymath.

574
00:47:11,674 --> 00:47:14,369
I knew it was polymath.

575
00:47:15,226 --> 00:47:17,117
Saving people's lives.

576
00:47:17,814 --> 00:47:19,778
Just delight to see that?

577
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:51,019
D-Vib tabules.

578
00:47:54,387 --> 00:47:55,850
Charge.

579
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,072
Shoot.

580
00:48:05,404 --> 00:48:07,689
Alright, everyone.
Close them up.

581
00:48:08,337 --> 00:48:11,013
Thank you.
Once again we are champions.

582
00:48:22,011 --> 00:48:23,892
Your patient today.

583
00:48:24,003 --> 00:48:25,533
How bad was he?

584
00:48:25,589 --> 00:48:27,128
He would've died tomorrow.

585
00:48:27,163 --> 00:48:28,759
Or maybe the day after.

586
00:48:29,142 --> 00:48:31,348
Now he'll have another 10 years.

587
00:48:31,404 --> 00:48:33,515
You have power over death.

588
00:48:33,584 --> 00:48:37,380
A doctor's triumphs are only temporary.
I learn that from Victor Chang.

589
00:48:38,307 --> 00:48:40,671
The man you studied under
in Sidney?

590
00:48:40,734 --> 00:48:42,329
Yes.

591
00:48:44,301 --> 00:48:49,384
He treated the whole patient, and without any ego
with love, as you said.

592
00:48:51,819 --> 00:48:53,463
So what happened to him?

593
00:48:54,041 --> 00:48:57,572
6 years ago he was ambushed for money
on his way to work.

594
00:48:58,171 --> 00:49:01,339
He refused to pay, so the guy shot Victor twice in the head.

595
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:05,510
Where you are, death will find you.

596
00:49:05,538 --> 00:49:08,741
Even if you're in a house built up
strong and whole.

597
00:49:10,211 --> 00:49:11,910
That's from the Qur-an.

598
00:49:13,136 --> 00:49:15,310
I studied Islam
a few years ago.

599
00:49:15,338 --> 00:49:18,347
When i was preparing for a trip
to Pakistan.

600
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:22,858
See? I was getting ready for you
before i even knew you.

601
00:49:34,122 --> 00:49:35,578
Whose car is this?

602
00:49:35,627 --> 00:49:37,041
My butler's.

603
00:49:37,076 --> 00:49:39,180
What's your butler driving?
-My Audi.

604
00:49:40,437 --> 00:49:41,725
Lucky butler.

605
00:49:42,122 --> 00:49:43,383
WHere are we going?

606
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:46,281
To the very edge
of the kingdom.

607
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:24,040
Come on.

608
00:50:25,113 --> 00:50:26,729
Look at this.

609
00:50:30,489 --> 00:50:32,342
Now, be careful.

610
00:50:33,673 --> 00:50:36,016
You brought me to the end
of the world.

611
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:43,263
I'm going to Australia.

612
00:50:43,576 --> 00:50:45,429
Why are you running away from me?

613
00:50:46,063 --> 00:50:49,289
Victor Chang Institute is doing a fund raiser.

614
00:50:49,721 --> 00:50:51,832
I'm making the keynote speech.

615
00:50:52,575 --> 00:50:54,289
You're doing this for me.

616
00:50:54,345 --> 00:50:55,738
For us.

617
00:50:58,297 --> 00:51:02,421
The world is ours,
this world and the world beyond.

618
00:51:02,466 --> 00:51:04,354
I never think about
the world beyond.

619
00:51:04,458 --> 00:51:07,050
You sleep with a Qur-an
at your bed side.

620
00:51:07,091 --> 00:51:08,236
Habit, hardly ever read it.

621
00:51:08,285 --> 00:51:10,298
I know you do.

622
00:51:11,663 --> 00:51:13,711
Islam is very important to me.

623
00:51:14,011 --> 00:51:17,062
To me it means, the constant rafimation
of one's character.

624
00:51:17,383 --> 00:51:19,027
I believe in that.

625
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:22,912
I've been reforming my character
since i was seven.

626
00:51:23,309 --> 00:51:25,239
It's finally getting me somewhere.

627
00:51:26,284 --> 00:51:28,931
Your divorce has put things
on a different footing.

628
00:51:29,467 --> 00:51:30,781
You mean with your family?

629
00:51:30,844 --> 00:51:33,108
Yes, a barrier has come down.

630
00:51:34,202 --> 00:51:37,786
Well, barriers coming down is good.

631
00:51:42,184 --> 00:51:45,430
Last one back to the car
is a squash tomato.

632
00:52:01,547 --> 00:52:02,585
- Look.
- What?

633
00:54:18,555 --> 00:54:20,389
It has been said...

634
00:54:20,509 --> 00:54:22,560
That for evil to triumpht...

635
00:54:23,017 --> 00:54:25,743
Good men must do nothing.

636
00:54:26,028 --> 00:54:29,445
Tonight, we give heartfelt thanks...

637
00:54:29,502 --> 00:54:31,279
At a good man.

638
00:54:31,471 --> 00:54:33,342
Dr Victor Chang.

639
00:54:33,614 --> 00:54:35,362
Did a great deal.

640
00:54:35,619 --> 00:54:37,153
And of that...

641
00:54:37,488 --> 00:54:39,411
We can all be thankful.

642
00:54:39,704 --> 00:54:41,345
As we look forward...

643
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:43,245
To the future.

644
00:55:30,669 --> 00:55:32,096
Nice one.

645
00:55:34,216 --> 00:55:35,715
What are we gonna do?

646
00:55:37,342 --> 00:55:40,799
Our objective is to protect Hasnat.

647
00:55:40,963 --> 00:55:42,690
So we rubbish the story.

648
00:55:43,411 --> 00:55:44,912
But they'll find out eventually.

649
00:55:44,969 --> 00:55:47,224
Well, we're buying time.

650
00:55:47,267 --> 00:55:49,297
That's what we need, isn't it?

651
00:55:49,703 --> 00:55:53,328
Talk about putting 2 and 2 together,
and making 5.

652
00:55:53,357 --> 00:55:55,819
Not a word, not a word of truth.

653
00:55:55,855 --> 00:55:58,031
Officially, i'm furious.

654
00:55:58,088 --> 00:56:00,559
It's upseting for Wills and Harry.

655
00:56:00,644 --> 00:56:02,071
Unofficially?

656
00:56:02,114 --> 00:56:04,341
Well, to be honest.

657
00:56:05,297 --> 00:56:09,015
Richard, we're laughing ourselves silly over this.

658
00:56:16,374 --> 00:56:17,772
For God sake.

659
00:56:21,478 --> 00:56:23,048
What do i look like?

660
00:56:23,504 --> 00:56:27,410
One minute everyone's pointing at me
because i'm sleeping with the Princess of Wales.

661
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:30,000
Next thing she denies it,
and i'm the hospital joke.

662
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:31,858
I was just trying to protect you.

663
00:56:31,872 --> 00:56:33,050
Protect?

664
00:56:33,107 --> 00:56:36,356
I knew you'd be upset,
that's why we rubbish the story.

665
00:56:36,377 --> 00:56:37,283
Rubbish?

666
00:56:37,305 --> 00:56:39,820
Yes, good choice of words.
That's exactly what i felt like.

667
00:56:39,855 --> 00:56:42,527
You can't object to being on
the front pages and then...

668
00:56:42,569 --> 00:56:45,980
Complain when i protect you from looking like Cassanova.

669
00:56:46,002 --> 00:56:47,232
You've blown our cover.

670
00:56:47,261 --> 00:56:49,958
It can be dealt with,
i'm good at handling the press.

671
00:56:49,979 --> 00:56:50,902
Oh, manigficent.

672
00:56:50,931 --> 00:56:52,822
Now i'm clear on what you want.

673
00:56:52,836 --> 00:56:55,077
How could it not had been clear?

674
00:56:55,627 --> 00:56:57,347
I am a surgeon!

675
00:56:57,467 --> 00:57:00,999
I can't work with paparazzi sticking their cameras in my face.

676
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:04,267
If you had to put up
what i have to put up with...

677
00:57:04,296 --> 00:57:06,133
Exactly, i don't have to put up with it.

678
00:57:06,175 --> 00:57:08,109
And i don't want to put up with it.

679
00:57:09,438 --> 00:57:11,136
So what are you saying?

680
00:57:11,343 --> 00:57:13,655
I'm saying there's no future.

681
00:57:14,454 --> 00:57:17,215
The way your life is,
the way my life is.

682
00:57:18,071 --> 00:57:19,420
It's pointless.

683
00:57:33,837 --> 00:57:35,429
Hallo, Dr Khan?

684
00:57:35,549 --> 00:57:36,772
How did you get this number?

685
00:57:36,808 --> 00:57:38,406
We would like to visit you
at the office tomorrow.

686
00:57:38,449 --> 00:57:39,479
How did you get this number?

687
00:57:39,494 --> 00:57:41,905
Can you give me some...

688
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:32,055
Sonya, it's me.

689
00:58:33,572 --> 00:58:37,554
I'm sorry, i know it's 3.30 in the morning, but...

690
00:58:38,341 --> 00:58:40,132
Can you talk?

691
00:59:06,217 --> 00:59:08,574
I'll never be happy again.

692
00:59:11,171 --> 00:59:13,358
It's the end,
i just know it is.

693
00:59:13,385 --> 00:59:15,008
I know it isn't.

694
00:59:15,044 --> 00:59:17,513
You haven't gone this far
for nothing.

695
00:59:17,986 --> 00:59:21,791
Nobody goes this far
for nothing.

696
00:59:23,727 --> 00:59:24,797
Come...

697
00:59:50,516 --> 00:59:53,277
Good morning, may i speak
to Hasnat Khan please?

698
00:59:53,341 --> 00:59:55,742
He's in the Cardiac Surgical Unit.

699
00:59:55,778 --> 00:59:56,713
Please hold.

700
00:59:56,734 --> 00:59:58,476
Yes I'll hold.

701
01:00:01,281 --> 01:00:03,292
I'm sorry, Dr Khan's not available.

702
01:00:03,311 --> 01:00:04,634
He's not available?

703
01:00:05,165 --> 01:00:07,169
What do you mean
he's not in?

704
01:00:07,289 --> 01:00:09,525
He's in but not available?

705
01:00:10,621 --> 01:00:14,057
Morning, love.
Can i have a word with Dr. Hasnat Khan, please?

706
01:00:14,091 --> 01:00:15,606
He's in the Surgical Unit.

707
01:00:15,675 --> 01:00:16,611
He's very busy now.

708
01:00:16,645 --> 01:00:18,771
Yes, but it's rather urgent.

709
01:00:19,322 --> 01:00:21,017
My name's Rita.

710
01:00:21,046 --> 01:00:23,409
Rita Johnson.

711
01:00:26,131 --> 01:00:27,897
Hasnat, it's me.

712
01:00:59,511 --> 01:01:01,150
Hasnat!

713
01:01:02,554 --> 01:01:04,288
Hasnat!

714
01:01:06,212 --> 01:01:08,104
Hasnat!

715
01:02:40,293 --> 01:02:41,943
I want to say this.

716
01:02:42,936 --> 01:02:44,605
Yes, i've been a mad bitch.

717
01:02:44,725 --> 01:02:48,044
Yes, i've been a stalker,
and yes most of all...

718
01:02:48,089 --> 01:02:52,097
I put on a crummy Liverpool accent
just to get your attention.

719
01:02:52,293 --> 01:02:55,172
But, i was provoked.

720
01:02:55,292 --> 01:02:58,489
I don't know what to say if i upset you,
that was because...

721
01:02:59,211 --> 01:03:01,092
I don't know,
i was trying to celebrate you...

722
01:03:01,109 --> 01:03:05,187
And protect you at the same time.
Those two things got confused.

723
01:03:06,373 --> 01:03:07,429
But...

724
01:03:09,077 --> 01:03:14,267
I think i have a right to be confuse
when i'm up against a gorgeous creature like you.

725
01:03:17,593 --> 01:03:18,735
Plus...

726
01:03:19,549 --> 01:03:21,107
I'm a Princess.

727
01:03:21,149 --> 01:03:23,026
And i get what i want.

728
01:03:29,396 --> 01:03:31,388
The poeple have spoken.

729
01:03:32,366 --> 01:03:36,543
I like the way Blair walks,
like he's crossing a bridge.

730
01:03:36,914 --> 01:03:38,793
He's what this country needs.

731
01:03:38,851 --> 01:03:40,577
Yes it is.

732
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:46,203
But i think we need to
think about beyond this country.

733
01:03:46,224 --> 01:03:48,142
My work is here.

734
01:03:48,834 --> 01:03:51,906
Well, all you need to do
is finish your PhD and then...

735
01:03:51,949 --> 01:03:54,104
We could pretty much live anywhere.

736
01:03:54,224 --> 01:03:56,023
People...
-People have hearts everywhere.

737
01:03:56,038 --> 01:03:58,454
Yes, they do.
-Hearts that need repairing?

738
01:03:58,482 --> 01:03:59,916
Exactly.

739
01:04:00,036 --> 01:04:01,401
America...

740
01:04:01,521 --> 01:04:02,756
Australia.

741
01:04:02,998 --> 01:04:04,761
See my point?

742
01:04:05,382 --> 01:04:08,591
If i could just get the boys away from here
for some of the time...

743
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:10,276
Somewhere warm.

744
01:04:17,051 --> 01:04:19,380
There's been a communication
from my family.

745
01:04:19,416 --> 01:04:20,529
Saying what?

746
01:04:20,557 --> 01:04:24,346
Saying "you are 36, this is beyond the age when you're expected to marry".

747
01:04:26,158 --> 01:04:27,523
Haven't you escaped all that?

748
01:04:27,552 --> 01:04:29,150
The press coverage stirs things up.

749
01:04:29,172 --> 01:04:33,176
The Phatan men is expected to marry a woman who will run an extended household.

750
01:04:33,211 --> 01:04:35,780
A woman who will live with her husband's mother and family.

751
01:04:35,794 --> 01:04:37,614
Someone from within the clan.

752
01:04:38,834 --> 01:04:40,496
And what about you?

753
01:04:41,196 --> 01:04:42,466
What are your feelings?

754
01:04:42,516 --> 01:04:44,322
I want to save people's lives.

755
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:48,054
Hasnat, i asked about your feelings.

756
01:04:51,808 --> 01:04:53,542
I love you.

757
01:04:57,144 --> 01:05:01,278
But do you want us
to be together inspite all of our problems?

758
01:05:03,762 --> 01:05:05,519
Do you want to make this work?

759
01:05:05,569 --> 01:05:07,917
Yes.
I do.

760
01:05:09,819 --> 01:05:11,909
Then it's time
i meet your family.

761
01:05:12,016 --> 01:05:13,379
Are you serious?

762
01:05:13,415 --> 01:05:14,407
Uh um...

763
01:05:14,921 --> 01:05:18,054
I think i should go there, and they can get
a good look of how i really am.

764
01:05:18,174 --> 01:05:20,616
Okay, then we'll go out there together.

765
01:05:20,736 --> 01:05:23,203
Hasnat, we can't go together.

766
01:05:23,231 --> 01:05:26,171
We'll be on the front page of every newspaper
in the world.

767
01:05:27,883 --> 01:05:30,367
I'll go alone.

768
01:05:39,838 --> 01:05:42,967
Doesn't matter how much you've charmed
the rest of his family...

769
01:05:43,017 --> 01:05:45,222
But mother is the only one that counts.

770
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:46,420
She's the key.

771
01:05:47,155 --> 01:05:48,645
Tough nut to crack.

772
01:05:48,688 --> 01:05:50,436
She's an educated woman.

773
01:05:50,472 --> 01:05:53,509
From a generation where such a thing is rare.

774
01:05:53,566 --> 01:05:55,664
I would say two things.

775
01:05:55,784 --> 01:05:57,633
Don't try to impress her.

776
01:05:57,683 --> 01:06:01,464
And don't imply you're as close to her son
as you're obviously are.

777
01:06:13,450 --> 01:06:17,649
Diana, i'd like to introduce you to Hasnat's father, Rashid.

778
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:19,713
Welcome, my dear.
-Hello.

779
01:06:20,284 --> 01:06:21,683
Now then, Diana...

780
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:23,346
How good are you with names?

781
01:06:25,459 --> 01:06:28,392
Diana, this is Hasnat's mother, Naheed.

782
01:06:35,244 --> 01:06:36,921
Lovely to meet you.

783
01:06:57,011 --> 01:06:58,595
Thank you.

784
01:07:08,161 --> 01:07:09,852
Sir Cyril Radcliffe.

785
01:07:10,145 --> 01:07:12,417
An Englishman by that name?

786
01:07:12,453 --> 01:07:18,229
Is given 5 weeks to decide the fate of
90 million people.

787
01:07:18,265 --> 01:07:21,312
And who advices it?
Mountbatten.

788
01:07:21,619 --> 01:07:25,188
Your former husband's favorite uncle.

789
01:07:25,894 --> 01:07:29,849
Muslims go one way,
Hindus the other.

790
01:07:29,906 --> 01:07:34,926
6 billion people crossed
the new border.

791
01:07:34,961 --> 01:07:37,827
Inevitably, there are crashes
and massacres.

792
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:40,960
One million people die.

793
01:07:41,003 --> 01:07:42,751
I was 16.

794
01:07:42,787 --> 01:07:46,193
And i can't forget that.

795
01:07:47,228 --> 01:07:48,911
I'm sorry.

796
01:07:49,768 --> 01:07:55,033
Yes, the English always say sorry
so beautifully.

797
01:07:59,419 --> 01:08:01,182
It's a power cut.

798
01:08:07,791 --> 01:08:09,689
Come on Diana...

799
01:08:09,725 --> 01:08:11,055
Ready?

800
01:08:20,893 --> 01:08:23,205
That was fun.

801
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:27,560
Diana, i want you to meet Hasnat's grandmother, Nanny Appa.

802
01:08:27,588 --> 01:08:29,044
Hello.

803
01:08:35,174 --> 01:08:39,131
She says that you are
a young lioness.

804
01:09:11,802 --> 01:09:13,579
You must forgive me.

805
01:09:13,907 --> 01:09:17,007
I can't help saying my piece
about the British.

806
01:09:20,054 --> 01:09:23,115
Now everyone please,
try very hard to relax.

807
01:09:23,408 --> 01:09:24,551
Say cheese.

808
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:26,264
Cheese!

809
01:09:26,306 --> 01:09:31,425
God, it was magical. It was like a dream
of how life should really be, children and...

810
01:09:31,545 --> 01:09:36,138
Grown up and grandparents living together,
one big family.

811
01:09:36,152 --> 01:09:38,065
You know what your grandmother
called me?

812
01:09:38,122 --> 01:09:40,591
A young lioness.

813
01:09:41,348 --> 01:09:43,503
She's right,
as always.

814
01:09:45,547 --> 01:09:47,557
Perhaps that's the future.

815
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,120
Being lions?

816
01:09:49,199 --> 01:09:50,847
No.

817
01:09:50,876 --> 01:09:53,142
Living abroad.

818
01:09:53,863 --> 01:09:55,554
But that's impossible.

819
01:09:55,604 --> 01:09:56,834
My work,
your boys.

820
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:59,467
Yes i know, my boys.
But...

821
01:09:59,587 --> 01:10:02,402
Anything's possible,
isn't it?

822
01:10:03,715 --> 01:10:05,866
We just have to mak it possible.

823
01:10:07,136 --> 01:10:08,292
Yes.

824
01:10:10,021 --> 01:10:11,105
Yes?

825
01:10:11,177 --> 01:10:12,739
Yes.

826
01:10:12,859 --> 01:10:13,917
Yes?

827
01:10:13,995 --> 01:10:15,249
Yes.

828
01:11:08,328 --> 01:11:11,610
All of us,
if we're lucky, grow old.

829
01:11:11,631 --> 01:11:16,991
But in the future, old people will make
a much larger percentage of the population.

830
01:11:17,365 --> 01:11:20,870
The old, and that will include me,
will be weak.

831
01:11:20,990 --> 01:11:25,939
But we won't be ware.
This will be the final battles of our lives.

832
01:11:26,003 --> 01:11:31,083
And we must fight them, by establishing a habit of respect
for the older generation.

833
01:11:31,126 --> 01:11:35,288
And by keeping our own skills fresh,
so that when we're in our 90s...

834
01:11:35,317 --> 01:11:41,351
We can still be active contributing members
of our communities and families.

835
01:11:41,372 --> 01:11:43,056
Thank you.

836
01:11:44,302 --> 01:11:45,633
Bravo.

837
01:11:47,822 --> 01:11:49,030
Bravo...

838
01:11:59,263 --> 01:12:01,423
Professor.
-Please, call me Christian.

839
01:12:01,466 --> 01:12:02,977
Christian.

840
01:12:03,236 --> 01:12:04,459
Diana.

841
01:12:07,142 --> 01:12:09,113
I want to tell you something
confidential.

842
01:12:09,169 --> 01:12:13,001
I'm very good at keeping secret
except my own.

843
01:12:13,491 --> 01:12:15,922
I'm in love with a heart surgeon.

844
01:12:15,979 --> 01:12:18,038
He's still finishing
his PhD, but...

845
01:12:18,103 --> 01:12:20,154
I believe he's a man of genius.

846
01:12:20,182 --> 01:12:21,357
What's his training?

847
01:12:21,443 --> 01:12:23,846
He was a favorite pupil
of Victor Chang.

848
01:12:23,882 --> 01:12:25,630
He's now with Professor Yaku.

849
01:12:25,644 --> 01:12:27,618
That's some reference.

850
01:12:29,870 --> 01:12:31,469
I want to marry him.

851
01:12:31,519 --> 01:12:33,829
But, he's a very private man.

852
01:12:33,872 --> 01:12:37,058
We can't cope with England, so...

853
01:12:37,178 --> 01:12:40,216
I'm thinking seriously
about living abroad.

854
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:43,072
You want me to find him a job.

855
01:12:43,892 --> 01:12:45,403
Yes.

856
01:13:04,865 --> 01:13:06,737
It was my son, William...

857
01:13:06,766 --> 01:13:11,834
Who suggested i should clear a load of
clothes out of my closet.

858
01:13:11,863 --> 01:13:16,301
And give the proceeds to the AIDS
Crisis Trust Charity.

859
01:13:16,581 --> 01:13:21,015
I hope you've all remembered your check books
for the garage sale.

860
01:13:21,216 --> 01:13:23,745
Sorry, auction.

861
01:13:24,004 --> 01:13:26,402
And maybe some big laundry bags.

862
01:13:26,416 --> 01:13:29,236
So you can carry your clothes home.

863
01:13:30,029 --> 01:13:33,674
Now, i'm not gonna stay and watch here
and embarrased you.

864
01:13:33,696 --> 01:13:36,842
But please, be generous.

865
01:13:37,417 --> 01:13:41,054
Because there are so many people
who need you...

866
01:13:41,090 --> 01:13:42,823
To be generous.

867
01:13:43,248 --> 01:13:44,266
Thank you.

868
01:13:46,739 --> 01:13:47,941
Hello?

869
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:50,777
This is Diana,
we've just landed.

870
01:13:51,424 --> 01:13:54,036
So tell me,
how did it go?

871
01:13:55,452 --> 01:13:56,560
What?

872
01:13:58,517 --> 01:14:01,431
$5,5 million?

873
01:14:01,776 --> 01:14:03,028
Yes!

874
01:14:17,308 --> 01:14:20,877
A written request for my CV from the world's most famous heart surgeon.

875
01:14:20,997 --> 01:14:23,024
To go with my job application.

876
01:14:24,024 --> 01:14:26,010
There's been a slight mistake.

877
01:14:26,305 --> 01:14:28,429
Did i apply for a job
in Boston?

878
01:14:28,472 --> 01:14:29,781
Funny i don't remember it.

879
01:14:29,810 --> 01:14:31,768
Things have got ahead
of themselves.

880
01:14:31,790 --> 01:14:35,063
Funnier still, i actually seemed to
have got the job.

881
01:14:35,301 --> 01:14:37,461
We talked about living abroad.

882
01:14:37,490 --> 01:14:39,952
But we weren't really talking
about living abroad.

883
01:14:39,988 --> 01:14:41,701
You're a wonderful doctor...

884
01:14:41,729 --> 01:14:43,509
I was simply using
my connection.

885
01:14:43,537 --> 01:14:46,041
I don't want anything from you.

886
01:14:46,235 --> 01:14:48,388
I've worked long and hard
to get myself a life...

887
01:14:48,402 --> 01:14:50,625
Don't go and reorganize it
without asking.

888
01:14:50,669 --> 01:14:53,910
I was trying to find a way for us
to be together...

889
01:14:53,944 --> 01:14:55,572
Someone has to do something.

890
01:14:55,601 --> 01:14:57,730
If you don't understand
how i feel about my work...

891
01:14:57,752 --> 01:14:59,690
How can we be together?

892
01:15:38,226 --> 01:15:39,744
Yes?

893
01:15:40,493 --> 01:15:42,308
Boss, i don't know if you want this.
But...

894
01:15:42,351 --> 01:15:44,668
They're not so bad,
your security.

895
01:15:44,998 --> 01:15:47,230
At least they've stopped making jokes
about my car.

896
01:15:47,266 --> 01:15:48,410
Thank you, Paul.

897
01:15:48,446 --> 01:15:51,143
The big one supports Queen's parkranger,
i never met anyone...

898
01:15:51,263 --> 01:15:53,908
Who genuinly supported it.

899
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:55,527
Hasnat!

900
01:16:01,835 --> 01:16:04,425
I can't seem to live
without you.

901
01:16:06,668 --> 01:16:11,263
And yet the complications of trying to find some way of actually living with you...

902
01:16:11,652 --> 01:16:13,443
Is just beyond me.

903
01:16:14,810 --> 01:16:16,253
But that's nothing.

904
01:16:17,037 --> 01:16:18,821
You were trying to find your way.

905
01:16:22,036 --> 01:16:23,756
I'm so sorry.

906
01:17:13,620 --> 01:17:15,915
Good afternoon, Queen's park rangers.

907
01:17:16,124 --> 01:17:17,124
Sir...

908
01:17:46,619 --> 01:17:49,270
Hasnat, asslamualaikum.

909
01:17:49,327 --> 01:17:50,874
Walaikumsalam.

910
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:55,418
Hasnat, we're all very proud of your achievement.

911
01:17:55,821 --> 01:17:57,655
You're a brilliant doctor.

912
01:17:57,775 --> 01:17:59,326
Shining light.

913
01:17:59,715 --> 01:18:01,499
What did the family think
of Diana?

914
01:18:01,549 --> 01:18:03,385
The family loves Diana.

915
01:18:03,803 --> 01:18:05,731
But it's a big question.

916
01:18:06,162 --> 01:18:10,574
Should the most famous woman in the world
become part of our family?

917
01:18:11,034 --> 01:18:12,615
And what's the answer?

918
01:18:12,636 --> 01:18:15,802
Hasnat, you've been blessed
twice by God.

919
01:18:15,922 --> 01:18:18,039
You have your calling as a doctor.

920
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:20,104
And a wonderful girlfriend.

921
01:18:20,370 --> 01:18:24,081
But is it possible to have both?

922
01:18:24,851 --> 01:18:27,276
I've known you since you were a child.

923
01:18:27,643 --> 01:18:29,736
You're a private person.

924
01:18:30,449 --> 01:18:35,646
Do you really tink you can work as a doctor
when you are so much in the public eye?

925
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:40,080
On the other hand,
if you were to marry Diana...

926
01:18:40,109 --> 01:18:44,298
It'll be a great thing for Pakistan,
the whole Muslim world.

927
01:18:49,342 --> 01:18:50,651
What did my mother think?

928
01:18:50,881 --> 01:18:52,974
Your mother would never give her approval.

929
01:18:53,003 --> 01:18:56,082
Diana is a divorced woman
and a Christian.

930
01:18:56,544 --> 01:19:00,861
In a long journey of life, from time to time,
we come to a fork in the book.

931
01:19:01,634 --> 01:19:04,792
Hasnat, it is time for you
to choose.

932
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:08,497
You're making it sound so simple,.

933
01:19:08,525 --> 01:19:10,425
Life is simple.

934
01:19:12,989 --> 01:19:15,018
I love her so much.

935
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:19,940
See you in 4 weeks!

936
01:20:19,969 --> 01:20:21,379
Bye mom!

937
01:21:18,116 --> 01:21:21,051
This must be the only park
we haven't visited in London.

938
01:21:21,171 --> 01:21:23,277
We've done all the others.

939
01:21:24,428 --> 01:21:27,636
Well, clockwise
or anti-clockwise?

940
01:21:27,701 --> 01:21:29,205
I don't mind.

941
01:21:34,957 --> 01:21:36,144
Long day.

942
01:21:36,264 --> 01:21:38,100
It was hard in the hospital.

943
01:21:38,554 --> 01:21:39,877
It gets dangerous.

944
01:21:39,899 --> 01:21:43,893
Dodging the food trolleys trying to finish their rounds before the ice cream melts.

945
01:21:50,650 --> 01:21:53,190
There's just one thing.

946
01:21:53,665 --> 01:21:55,823
I know we could find a way.

947
01:21:59,230 --> 01:22:03,122
So my trip to Lahore was a failure,
i didn't wint them over.

948
01:22:03,413 --> 01:22:06,578
It's not to do with winning them over,
you can win anyone over.

949
01:22:06,614 --> 01:22:09,983
But your family don't want me to be your wife.

950
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:12,803
That's no surprise.

951
01:22:12,825 --> 01:22:17,280
I've never once been accepted by a family,
not my own, the one i married into...

952
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:19,909
When i think of the word,
i shudder.

953
01:22:19,937 --> 01:22:22,204
My family haven't said that.

954
01:22:24,114 --> 01:22:27,020
But your mother won't give us
her blessing.

955
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:38,441
That dream that you had,
sitting in a compound in a hall.

956
01:22:38,470 --> 01:22:40,946
Surrounded by children
is impossible.

957
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:42,449
Why?

958
01:22:43,471 --> 01:22:45,442
Because if i marry you...

959
01:22:45,510 --> 01:22:48,085
I have to marry the whole word aswell.

960
01:22:48,697 --> 01:22:51,236
We can't simply be
a man and a woman.

961
01:22:51,258 --> 01:22:53,526
But you must have known that
from the start.

962
01:22:53,548 --> 01:22:56,131
When you fall in love,
you just keep going despite the warning lights.

963
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:59,533
So now you've had the best of what's on offer,
you're just gonna clear off.

964
01:22:59,576 --> 01:23:00,569
That's not true.

965
01:23:00,605 --> 01:23:03,741
I've struggled to see how i could marry
the most famous woman in the world.

966
01:23:03,777 --> 01:23:06,914
But i'll be giving up the very thing
that defines me.

967
01:23:11,101 --> 01:23:13,519
I want to make it work.

968
01:23:14,094 --> 01:23:15,975
I can't stop loving you.

969
01:23:17,234 --> 01:23:18,954
They always say that
when they're saying goodbye.

970
01:23:18,968 --> 01:23:20,653
I'm not saying goodbye.

971
01:23:20,682 --> 01:23:22,833
Expect Charles,
i give him that.

972
01:23:22,891 --> 01:23:24,305
Don't bring him into it.

973
01:23:24,334 --> 01:23:26,975
Why not?
You belong with him now.

974
01:23:27,428 --> 01:23:30,551
You're on the list, labelled
"the past".

975
01:23:30,961 --> 01:23:32,493
Aren't you?

976
01:23:33,177 --> 01:23:34,838
I don't want to see it
like that.

977
01:23:34,867 --> 01:23:37,446
Then why call me in the middle of the night,
to this...

978
01:23:37,468 --> 01:23:39,309
God forsaken park...

979
01:23:39,374 --> 01:23:41,249
To get me my marching orders?

980
01:23:41,292 --> 01:23:42,307
It's a bit dramatic.

981
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:43,839
Dramatic?

982
01:23:44,199 --> 01:23:47,668
Dramatic? My whole life has been dramatic.

983
01:23:47,949 --> 01:23:51,677
It's been full of the sound of people
shutting doors on me.

984
01:23:51,886 --> 01:23:54,125
You say you love me,
you'll always love me...

985
01:23:54,147 --> 01:23:58,527
There's about 5 billion people on this planet
who can say that.

986
01:24:05,247 --> 01:24:06,909
But is there one...

987
01:24:11,209 --> 01:24:13,195
Who can stay with me?

988
01:24:22,822 --> 01:24:25,747
Is this fucking mike on?

989
01:24:26,754 --> 01:24:28,243
I'm not saying it's over.

990
01:24:28,286 --> 01:24:30,793
Yes you are,
you just can't say it.

991
01:24:30,836 --> 01:24:32,095
I'm not saying it's the end.

992
01:24:32,116 --> 01:24:34,088
Have the courage,
go on say it!

993
01:24:34,138 --> 01:24:35,511
I'm not saying it's the end.

994
01:24:35,562 --> 01:24:37,886
Yes, it is!
Okay, i'll say it.

995
01:24:37,965 --> 01:24:39,418
It's over!

996
01:24:40,015 --> 01:24:41,667
Don't follow me!

997
01:24:45,389 --> 01:24:47,216
Diana!

998
01:28:04,567 --> 01:28:06,187
Boss, this won't take long.

999
01:28:06,208 --> 01:28:09,287
People aren't happy with the way things have been going over the last few weeks.

1000
01:28:09,323 --> 01:28:11,620
Members of your staffs feel
they've been exposed...

1001
01:28:11,641 --> 01:28:15,551
To situations that carry with them
element of danger.

1002
01:28:16,119 --> 01:28:18,256
We'd like you to consider strategy.

1003
01:28:18,270 --> 01:28:21,407
There's a feeling there's no clear direction...

1004
01:28:21,527 --> 01:28:22,817
You should...

1005
01:28:43,181 --> 01:28:46,900
Also you've received an offer from Dodi Fayed.

1006
01:28:47,087 --> 01:28:48,996
To join him again.

1007
01:28:49,061 --> 01:28:51,507
This time just you.

1008
01:28:57,438 --> 01:28:58,798
Say yes.

1009
01:29:07,774 --> 01:29:09,745
So where are we going?

1010
01:29:10,035 --> 01:29:13,096
Sardinia.
Cala the Vulpe.

1011
01:29:13,359 --> 01:29:14,853
Fox Creek.

1012
01:29:15,032 --> 01:29:16,670
Very fond of foxes.

1013
01:29:17,659 --> 01:29:19,164
Why so?

1014
01:29:19,206 --> 01:29:20,710
They're like me.

1015
01:29:20,753 --> 01:29:23,115
We've all escaped from the Windsors.

1016
01:29:53,019 --> 01:29:53,616
Hello...

1017
01:29:53,638 --> 01:29:56,348
Jason Fraser, what's happening?

1018
01:29:57,840 --> 01:29:59,416
Where are you?

1019
01:29:59,684 --> 01:30:01,013
Here.

1020
01:30:02,570 --> 01:30:03,914
Where is here?

1021
01:30:03,966 --> 01:30:05,579
You know where are the foxes.

1022
01:30:07,044 --> 01:30:09,104
Work out, handsome.

1023
01:30:20,787 --> 01:30:21,556
Pronto.

1024
01:30:21,609 --> 01:30:22,631
I've got something big.

1025
01:30:22,654 --> 01:30:24,320
Can you be somewhere this moment?

1026
01:31:20,041 --> 01:31:21,776
- Morning.
- Morning.

1027
01:31:21,896 --> 01:31:23,224
You sleep well?

1028
01:31:47,101 --> 01:31:48,407
What's the matter?

1029
01:31:52,029 --> 01:31:53,828
What is she up to?

1030
01:32:29,596 --> 01:32:31,850
There's no time to get the Americans involved.

1031
01:32:32,037 --> 01:32:34,012
Oslo is the last conference,
before they ought to retreat.

1032
01:32:34,049 --> 01:32:35,923
But America's signing will be huge.

1033
01:32:35,967 --> 01:32:37,371
There are too many sticking point.

1034
01:32:37,401 --> 01:32:39,141
There's basically only 3.

1035
01:32:39,171 --> 01:32:41,643
Exemption for the border
between north and south Korea.

1036
01:32:41,695 --> 01:32:45,204
A delay in the treaty implementation,
and the whole smart mines issue.

1037
01:32:45,249 --> 01:32:46,131
Smart mines?

1038
01:32:46,138 --> 01:32:49,020
They blow themselves up within 7 years
so the land are safe.

1039
01:32:49,259 --> 01:32:51,566
It meand redefining what a landmine is.

1040
01:32:51,603 --> 01:32:53,484
Stop the bus.

1041
01:33:20,027 --> 01:33:21,751
Your son?

1042
01:34:13,759 --> 01:34:15,887
Please kindly leave the message
after the beep.

1043
01:34:17,775 --> 01:34:20,215
Hasnat it's me.

1044
01:34:21,359 --> 01:34:22,904
Hi it's me.

1045
01:34:23,127 --> 01:34:25,430
I really want you to call me.

1046
01:34:25,466 --> 01:34:28,003
I mean really really.

1047
01:34:29,243 --> 01:34:30,701
Call me.

1048
01:34:45,753 --> 01:34:47,145
Hello...

1049
01:34:51,248 --> 01:34:52,691
Dodi.

1050
01:34:57,611 --> 01:34:59,797
The falling dream I still get it.

1051
01:34:59,812 --> 01:35:01,508
But it's different these days.

1052
01:35:01,537 --> 01:35:03,680
How is the dream different?

1053
01:35:04,736 --> 01:35:07,095
Well, I don't know.
I suppose...

1054
01:35:07,620 --> 01:35:09,417
I suppose it's...

1055
01:35:09,701 --> 01:35:11,670
Something I enjoy now.

1056
01:35:11,790 --> 01:35:14,726
I don't feel the need to be caught anymore.

1057
01:35:15,091 --> 01:35:17,153
So maybe it's not falling.

1058
01:35:17,627 --> 01:35:19,276
Maybe it's more like flying.

1059
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:23,139
When you first came to me,
you told me your quest was a spiritual one.

1060
01:35:23,635 --> 01:35:25,736
Well, we danced with it
a few years.

1061
01:35:25,772 --> 01:35:27,463
Now the road is clear.

1062
01:35:27,755 --> 01:35:29,389
Your life is ahead of you.

1063
01:35:29,950 --> 01:35:32,006
With your talent and power...

1064
01:35:32,064 --> 01:35:33,988
You can do anything.

1065
01:35:40,622 --> 01:35:43,158
Does it feel right for you to be going on this trip?

1066
01:35:43,195 --> 01:35:44,929
Now that you feel differently.

1067
01:35:44,959 --> 01:35:47,139
I gotta have a bit of fun,
don't i?

1068
01:35:47,183 --> 01:35:49,348
And the boys are away so...

1069
01:35:50,303 --> 01:35:52,895
You're not going cause you feel lonely.

1070
01:35:56,466 --> 01:35:57,618
Oonagh...

1071
01:35:58,397 --> 01:35:59,979
Now that I've been loved...

1072
01:36:00,773 --> 01:36:02,741
I don't feel lonely anymore.

1073
01:37:44,683 --> 01:37:45,434
Yeah.

1074
01:37:45,499 --> 01:37:46,840
Hello, Hunter.

1075
01:37:47,496 --> 01:37:48,670
Where are you?

1076
01:37:49,056 --> 01:37:50,566
Looking right at you.

1077
01:37:52,293 --> 01:37:53,605
Did you get some more shots?

1078
01:37:53,663 --> 01:37:55,205
Oh yeah, plenty.

1079
01:37:55,235 --> 01:37:56,481
Good.

1080
01:37:56,838 --> 01:37:59,160
Well that's enough now.

1081
01:38:00,034 --> 01:38:02,075
I'll see you back in London.

1082
01:40:05,735 --> 01:40:07,467
Hi it's me.

1083
01:40:07,598 --> 01:40:09,755
I really want you to call me.

1084
01:40:10,025 --> 01:40:12,391
I mean really really.

1085
01:40:16,701 --> 01:40:18,436
Hi it's me.

1086
01:40:18,735 --> 01:40:20,593
I really want you to call me.

1087
01:40:21,033 --> 01:40:23,504
I mean really really...

1088
01:41:16,739 --> 01:41:18,247
Be ready...

1089
01:41:31,932 --> 01:41:33,921
Hello, Paul?

1090
01:41:34,257 --> 01:41:35,933
Yes, is he around?

1091
01:41:37,965 --> 01:41:39,692
Are you sure?

1092
01:43:28,354 --> 01:43:32,655
This is Diana, I can't take your call right now please leave a message.

1093
01:44:14,910 --> 01:44:16,105
Yes.

1094
01:44:31,089 --> 01:44:35,710
We don't know if Lady D was dead or not...

1095
01:44:35,747 --> 01:44:40,266
And we just know she's there...

1096
01:44:40,313 --> 01:44:44,510
In the old tunnel Place de l'Alma in Paris.

1097
01:46:25,306 --> 01:46:27,295
From the poet Rumi...

1098
01:46:27,824 --> 01:46:31,188
Somewhere beyond right and wrong
there is a garden...

1099
01:46:31,812 --> 01:46:33,938
I will meet you there.

1100
01:46:47,737 --> 01:46:51,565
Somewhere beyond right and wrong
there is a garden...

1101
01:46:52,402 --> 01:46:54,633
I will meet you there.

1102
01:46:57,965 --> 01:47:00,180
I will meet you there.

1103
01:48:01,639 --> 01:48:08,484
