1
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:12,959
Brandi!

2
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:17,736
- He did it again.
- He did?

3
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:20,305
I tried helping,
but he keeps asking for you.

4
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,933
- Yeah, he does that.
I want Brandi!

5
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:24,938
Brandi!

6
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,443
I'm here, Mr. Binckley.

7
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,248
I'm here.

8
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:34,276
Have we been bad again?

9
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,153
All right. You know what to do.

10
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,295
Oh, Mr. Binckley!

11
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:46,932
- I want Brandi!
- I'm right here, Mr. Binckley.

12
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:51,233
I'm Brandi. You know I'm Brandi.
I'm right here.

13
00:02:57,277 --> 00:03:00,512
- Mr. Binckley's all cleaned up?
- Yes, he's fine.

14
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,581
We're gonna have to talk to his family.

15
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:05,083
He is really becoming chronic.

16
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:08,253
No, you don't have to do that.
I'm more than happy to take care of him.

17
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:09,588
I know you are, Brandi,

18
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,223
but you may not have much time

19
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:14,359
to be spending on cases
like Mr. Binckley anymore.

20
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,562
What do you mean, Mrs. Petersen?

21
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:19,898
I'm considering making you
the new NA Captain.

22
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:22,167
- The captain of the NAs?
- Yes.

23
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:24,736
- Would you be interested?
- Yes. Very much.

24
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:27,973
I've watched you with the residents
and with the other nursing assistants

25
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:30,237
and I like what I see.

26
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:33,645
Of course, this is not an official offer,

27
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:38,217
but I wanted you to be aware
you are high on my list of possible captains.

28
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,620
Thank you, Mrs. Petersen.
I'll really try to do my best.

29
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,055
I know you will.

30
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,757
Then I can count on you
coming in tomorrow?

31
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:49,695
- Uh, Saturday?
- I know what day it is, Brandi.

32
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,830
Yes, of course, I know you do,

33
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:55,000
but I came in last Saturday.

34
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,526
Oh, I see.

35
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:02,601
But, no, no, no. I can come in.
It's fine. It's no problem.

36
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:06,345
Good, that's what I'm looking for.

37
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:10,009
Now, don't let me keep you.

38
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,910
Thank you, Mrs. Petersen.
Thank you a lot.

39
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,559
I'm just doing my job.

40
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,429
And I'm just asking for another week.
A couple of days even?

41
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,231
This ain't a charity ward.

42
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:28,967
Just another day.
I've got a job interview.

43
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:31,637
You vacate or I call the cops.
Your choice.

44
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:33,469
My choice?

45
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,709
What are you doing?

46
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:40,045
Making my choice.

47
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:42,537
Uh-uh. You don't take anything.

48
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:44,316
What?

49
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:46,485
You pay or your stuff stays.

50
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:49,788
Listen, I've got a job interview.

51
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,519
Can't I at least get my good clothes?

52
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:55,727
All right, all right, go ahead.
I'll wait.

53
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:58,162
- You'll wait?
- I'll wait.

54
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:31,430
I'll be right back.

55
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:32,989
Hey!

56
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:37,035
What the hell are you two doing?

57
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:39,338
Yeah, well, shove it!
I don't need it, all right?

58
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,740
Fucking asshole!
Shut your mouth.

59
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:44,835
Get back in your room
or I'm calling the cops.

60
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:48,013
- All right, that's it. You're out of here.
Come on.

61
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,549
What the hell have I got
to put up with this shit for?

62
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,608
Fucking asshole!

63
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:57,189
Get in here right away.
Yeah, they're on the third floor.

64
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,724
What the fuck are you doing?

65
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,325
Hey! Hey!

66
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:03,989
Get back here, you little fucker!
Get back here!

67
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,424
Fucking little bastard.

68
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:12,370
Stop. Stop, you little fucker!

69
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,033
Christ!

70
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,844
Fuck it.

71
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:40,121
Please, spare change?

72
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:44,970
Jesus!

73
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:48,804
Why don't you watch
where the fuck you're going, you asshole?

74
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:03,154
Hi.

75
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:09,683
Sorry about this. Couldn't get my suitcase
and get here on time.

76
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:15,167
I'm Thomas Bardo.
I have a 1:00 appointment.

77
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:18,398
Take a seat. Keep all that on your person.

78
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,167
A seat?

79
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:24,709
- But I have an appointment.
- Take a seat.

80
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:29,381
But I have a 1:00 appointment
and it's 1:00 now. I was almost late.

81
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:33,511
Sir, I don't want to have to tell you again.
Take a seat.

82
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:38,052
- But I have...
- Sir?

83
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:44,129
All right, thank you. I'll take a seat.
Thank you.

84
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,831
Keep all that on your person.

85
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,630
I will, of course. Thank you.

86
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,414
Bradeau. Thomas Bradeau?

87
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:39,611
Bardo. Thomas Bardo.

88
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:41,979
This way.

89
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:49,261
Take a seat.

90
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:53,765
Hi, I'm Thomas Bardo.
Sorry about the clothes.

91
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:55,600
And how do you spell your name?

92
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:57,966
B- A-R-D-O.

93
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:04,476
Yeah, you'll probably see
that I was a project manager.

94
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,611
Very challenging job,

95
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:10,048
but my company decided to downsize
just before my benefits kicked in.

96
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,850
You know how that is.

97
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:13,752
Then the unemployment ran out.

98
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:16,290
I thought I might have
better luck in the city...

99
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:19,191
but... You know how that goes.

100
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:23,523
You know,
I can't seem to find you in the computer.

101
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:25,957
Oh?

102
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:30,435
All right, you take that, fill it out,
and mail it in.

103
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:34,636
I've already filled this out.

104
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:38,743
Well, you can't be in the computer
until you fill it out and mail it in.

105
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:42,647
But I've already mailed this in.
That's how I got the appointment.

106
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:45,984
Well, you can't have an appointment
until you're in the computer.

107
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,119
But I have an appointment,
it was at 1:00,

108
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,783
and I've been waiting
for three and a half hours.

109
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:55,126
But you're not in the computer.

110
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:57,996
- But...
- You're not in the computer.

111
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:03,332
So you fill out the 976,
you mail it in to me

112
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:05,898
and I will make sure
you get an appointment.

113
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:11,176
Look, Mr. Lieber, this hasn't been
a good day for me, you know.

114
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:16,181
Can't you just take my word that
I've already sent this in or put me in now...

115
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:20,352
Sir, look, if you're willing
to follow procedures, we can work with you.

116
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,081
If not...

117
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,317
It's your choice.

118
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:31,052
Well, I guess I'd better fill this out, huh?

119
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:34,264
That's the procedure.

120
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,913
Hey, girl.

121
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,726
Hey.

122
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:04,295
- What are you so happy about?
- Happy?

123
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:07,265
Yeah, you look like the cat
that got the canary.

124
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,000
I got some possible good news.

125
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:12,265
Oh, yeah? What?
I could use some right about now.

126
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:15,640
- I don't want to say.
- Why not?

127
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:17,008
I don't want to jinx it.

128
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,976
- Jinx it?
- Yeah.

129
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,380
I'll let you know.

130
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,284
Whatever, girl.
You going to HighLow tonight?

131
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:29,521
- Yeah, of course.
- That's what I'm talking about. T.G.I.F.

132
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,589
- Except I've got to work tomorrow.
- You do?

133
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,657
- Yeah.
- Why?

134
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:34,192
Petersen needed someone.

135
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:37,195
Oh, my God. Christ, girl,
you're gonna make us all look bad.

136
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:41,232
You should just tell Petersen that she needs
to get her fat ass in here and she needs...

137
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:42,757
Oh, my...

138
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,371
- See you tomorrow, then?
- Yes. Yes.

139
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,506
And, um, Tanya?

140
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:50,775
I will be coming in on Saturday.

141
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,675
Oh! Um...

142
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:55,013
Are you needing anyone to work tomorrow?

143
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,815
As a matter of fact, I do.

144
00:11:56,816 --> 00:12:00,410
- Should I put you down for tomorrow?
- Sure.

145
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,519
Fine. We'll see you both tomorrow, then.

146
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:09,894
- Oh, my God.
- You're busted. You're busted.

147
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,987
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Mmm-hmm.

148
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:16,501
She's like a fucking ghost!

149
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:19,037
- I can't believe you said that.
- Oh, my God.

150
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:20,766
Shit, man.

151
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,075
- You think Rashid's gonna be there tonight?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

152
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,444
Do you think he's gonna have any good X?

153
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:28,346
He's Rashid.

154
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:31,041
Cool, man, because I could really
use some tonight, girl.

155
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:33,342
I really, really could.

156
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:12,139
Don't know whether to ask you for money
or give you some.

157
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:17,088
After the day I've had,
I'll take whatever I can get.

158
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:21,558
I got just what you need.

159
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:33,638
- What is it?
- Hey.

160
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:37,540
You letting the spirits escape.
Drink it. Drink it.

161
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:46,012
- Jesus.
- Drink some more. Drink some more.

162
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:50,288
Yeah, that's the way.

163
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,780
Show the spirits you mean it!

164
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:54,359
That's some stuff.

165
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,350
That's what she said.

166
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:03,501
Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord.

167
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:05,136
And thank you.

168
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:06,661
Sam.

169
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:09,002
The mars called Sam.

170
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:13,611
- Tom.
- Good to know you. Good to know you.

171
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:15,443
You, too.

172
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:20,318
Are you thinking about
staying here tonight?

173
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,153
Well, thinking about it.

174
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:26,958
Be careful because a lot of cops come here.
There's a donut shop down there.

175
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:30,161
Hey, I ain't shitting you, man.

176
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:33,398
Fat-boys Donuts,
is the best sugar pastries in the city.

177
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:36,100
Forget about your kiss-ass creams
and all that shit.

178
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:40,230
Fatboys is the place for the best,
and cops know it.

179
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:43,107
Okay, Sam, thanks for the info.

180
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,843
- Another drink?
- No, thanks. No, thanks.

181
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,709
Hey, nice lining.

182
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,843
- Pardon me?
- Lining.

183
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:55,016
Plaid's my favorite color.

184
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:00,984
Yeah.

185
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,898
- You need wheels.
- Wheels?

186
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:18,609
- All yours.
- You don't have to.

187
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:22,747
One thing I've learned is never say no
to something free,

188
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:28,276
which ain't all that hard,
because nothing's ever really free, right?

189
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:33,449
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah.

190
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,863
I will see you.

191
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,930
Okay.

192
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:04,789
You have a good time.
- Thank you.

193
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,324
Thank you.

194
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:07,985
Cheers.

195
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:15,832
Hey, how you doing?
Everything all right?

196
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:19,837
Excuse me, baby.
I need to talk to your guy. Yeah.

197
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:22,863
Listen, where's my money? My money?

198
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:26,604
Rashid! Over here.

199
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:31,581
You better make sure you're easy to find.

200
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:35,479
Look at you.

201
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:41,352
Hello.

202
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:44,062
Hey, Tanya. How are you doing?

203
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,463
I could be doing a lot better.

204
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:48,266
That's what I'm here for.

205
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,404
I think I'm gonna be doing a lot better
in a little while.

206
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:56,465
Baby, open wide and trust me.

207
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:04,709
Park's closed.

208
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:08,578
- You can't sleep here.
- Yeah.

209
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:14,218
There's nobody around here.

210
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:17,095
I'm not doing anybody any harm.

211
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,997
- Try the Mission.
- The Mission?

212
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:21,988
On Hope Street.

213
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,669
Hope Street? But that's far.

214
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,705
That's right. Come on.

215
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:31,141
Either that or I take you in,
your choice.

216
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,789
Hey, don't forget your cart.

217
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:10,181
- You okay?
- Yeah.

218
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:13,617
- You want to ride with me?
- No.

219
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:16,684
This cold air is waking me up.

220
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:20,224
Let's just get back to my place.

221
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:23,091
- You got anything to drink at your place?
- Mmm...

222
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,062
I got a couple of beers.

223
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:29,167
I'm gonna stop
and pick something up. Okay?

224
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,033
All right.

225
00:19:58,063 --> 00:19:59,860
Come on, start.

226
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:19,984
Hey!

227
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,619
- BRANDl: Sorry!
- Hey, what's your problem?

228
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,314
Oh, baby.

229
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:34,490
Shit.

230
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,861
Should have let him take me in.

231
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,205
Be some place to fucking stay.

232
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,756
- Hello?
- Hi, it's Brandi.

233
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:07,531
Yeah, I know.

234
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:10,899
Yeah, you're going to the store, right?

235
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,103
Yeah.

236
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:16,073
Can you pick up some snacks,
some chips or something?

237
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:18,804
I've really got the munchies.

238
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:23,680
Honey? Honey?

239
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:48,432
Hello?

240
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,968
Goddamn phone.

241
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:42,386
Hey! Hey, look. That car. That car.

242
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:45,956
I know that guy. I do. He's stuck on the car.

243
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:47,825
The guy was stuck like a goddamn bug.

244
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:51,693
Calm down right now
and keep those hands above your head.

245
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,394
You didn't even look.

246
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,500
Fuck.

247
00:25:58,456 --> 00:26:00,082
Help...

248
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,526
Help me, please.

249
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:05,195
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Help.

250
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:07,965
It wasrt my fault. You should have
watched where you were going.

251
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:09,899
Please help me.

252
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:14,167
I'm hurt. I'm hurt bad. Please.

253
00:26:20,178 --> 00:26:22,379
- Please.
- I gotta go.

254
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,281
- Please.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

255
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:27,842
Yeah, I will. I will. I'll get help.
I'll be right back.

256
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:13,931
- Hey, baby.
- Honey.

257
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:17,196
Whoa, baby, what's wrong? What's wrong?

258
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,197
Honey.

259
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:21,772
I was in an accident.

260
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:22,973
An accident? You okay?

261
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:26,377
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay, I'm okay.
But I haven't even told you yet.

262
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:28,746
I was waiting for later,

263
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:31,782
but I've been offered a new job,
an NA Captain job.

264
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:34,184
It's a big promotion. It's a lot more money.

265
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:36,353
And now this happens,
and it wasrt even my fault.

266
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:40,051
Okay, okay, okay. Wait a minute.
Just sit down, all right?

267
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:43,557
I think you really need a drink.

268
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:53,861
Here.

269
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:58,237
All right, don't look at it. Drink it.

270
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:04,371
Baby, what the fuck?
How bad was the accident?

271
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:14,551
I hit someone.

272
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:16,960
Oh, shit.

273
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:18,929
But it wasrt my fault.

274
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,131
Baby, it wasrt my fault.
He wasrt watching.

275
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:24,368
All right, whoa.
Slow down. Slow down. All right.

276
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,530
Just relax.

277
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,005
Have another.

278
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,743
There you go.

279
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,281
Okay, so you hit somebody. Bad?

280
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:39,650
- Yeah, bad.
- Anybody see?

281
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:41,885
- See?
- Was anybody around? Any witnesses?

282
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,053
No. No.

283
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,355
- You're sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

284
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:47,024
You get a look at him?

285
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:48,325
Uh...

286
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:49,993
He was a bum.

287
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:52,963
- He was a bum, a street person.
- A street person?

288
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:54,698
Yeah, he was pushing one of those things...

289
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:56,600
What? A can't? He was pushing a can't?

290
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:58,125
Yeah.

291
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:01,238
- Baby, you got nothing to worry about.
- I don't?

292
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,173
No. Not at all. You hit a bum.

293
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:05,509
Nobody saw. Nobody gonna give a shit.

294
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:09,546
- You think?
- Look, I know.

295
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:10,748
I've done a lot worse than that.

296
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,850
- A hell of a lot worse.
- You have?

297
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:17,287
Shit, I've done wasted assholes
in broad daylight and walked away from it.

298
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:19,187
It's no big deal.

299
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:22,526
Now, you were able
to drive away okay, right?

300
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:23,994
Yeah.

301
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:27,664
Shit, then you've got
nothing to worry about.

302
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:29,632
Nothing at all.

303
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:32,195
Baby, look,

304
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:37,441
you just need to relax. All right?

305
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,307
Open wide.

306
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:41,477
There we go.

307
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:45,215
You trust me, right?

308
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:47,183
There we go.

309
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:53,753
Let me take care of you, okay?

310
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,657
Cops try to pretend like they're everywhere.

311
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:05,869
Always watching.

312
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:09,396
Big bad eye in the sky.

313
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:12,569
Truth is

314
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:19,545
anybody can do anything to anyone

315
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:22,542
and get away with it.

316
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:25,480
I mean anything.

317
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:29,926
I mean, fuck,
look who's in the White House right now.

318
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:33,730
You've got nothing to worry about.

319
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:38,661
Anybody gives you any trouble,
you just tell me.

320
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:44,564
Any trouble you've got ends with me.

321
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,646
All right? Come here.

322
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:53,403
Oh, yeah, baby! Fuck, yeah!

323
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:01,878
Help me.

324
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:06,007
Fuck, yeah!

325
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:43,076
So you can help me, right?

326
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:46,089
Huh? Help you with what?

327
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:50,549
With this accident.
If I have any trouble with this accident.

328
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:54,822
Yeah.

329
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:57,927
Yeah, yeah, baby. No worries.

330
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:00,696
Whatever you need.

331

That your car?

362
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:33,276
Yes.

363
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:35,412
Sounds like the alarm's screwing up.

364
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:38,315
Want me to take a look at it?
I used to install those things.

365
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,984
No. Thanks. Can you wait?

366
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,918
Your nickel.

367
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:53,663
Car alarms, useless crap.

368
00:38:57,201 --> 00:38:59,066
Stop it!

369
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:01,771
Help's coming. I told you!

370
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:07,134
You have to stop this.

371
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:09,538
Will you stop it?

372
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,254
I said stop it!

373
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:50,453
- You fix it?
- Huh?

374
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:53,354
- Car alarm?
- Oh, yes. Yes.

375
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:56,426
You okay?

376
00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:59,662
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. Why?

377
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:01,297
Well, you look...

378
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:03,666
Look, I can take a look at it if you like?

379
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:08,866
No, no, no, no.
No, I'm late. For work. Come on.

380
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:11,906
So, where do you work again?

381
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,623
Mr. Binckley.

382
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,433
Come on. I got you.

383
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,436
- Where's Brandi?
- I'm right here. I'm Brandi.

384
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,904
- I want Brandi.
- I'm right here.

385
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:42,939
Do we have to go potty?

386
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,874
- Brandi?
Brandi.

387
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:46,943
Gloria will take Mr. Binckley.

388
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:49,435
- But...
- I'd like to talk to you.

389
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:51,948
Brandi?

390
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:55,118
Brandi is busy. Do we have to go poo-poo?

391
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,052
Walk with me.

392
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:02,292
- This just won't do.
- I'm sorry?

393
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,893
You know I'd like to promote you.

394
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:06,196
- I'd like to give you more responsibilities.
I want Brandi!

395
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:08,459
Yes, of course,
and I look forward to it.

396
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,867
I really do, Mrs. Petersen.
I'm grateful for it.

397
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:14,137
- Then this just won't do, will it?
- I'm sorry.

398
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:19,008
I can't have my NA captain coming in late,
even on the weekends. It just won't do.

399
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:21,644
- I agree. I agree.
- You agree?

400
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:24,477
- Yes.
- But you were almost an hour late.

401
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:27,275
Well, because of my car. Um...

402
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,853
- I'm having problems with my car.
- Your car?

403
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:33,556
Yeah, it's been acting up lately
and I had to take a cab.

404
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:36,025
- I'm really not near any bus stops.
- You could have called.

405
00:41:36,026 --> 00:41:39,429
If you want more responsibilities,
you need to stay on top of things.

406
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,363
Yes, I agree.

407
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:43,566
But you didn't.

408
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:45,535
- I didn't?
- Call.

409
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:47,594
You didn't call.

410
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:49,506
Are you all right?

411
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,808
Yes! Yes, I'm fine.

412
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:54,544
I had to wait outside for a cab.

413
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:57,775
- I know that's really not an excuse...
- Don't you have a cell?

414
00:41:58,382 --> 00:42:00,850
- A cell phone?
- Yes, of course.

415
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:04,153
If you have a cell phone,
why didn't you use it?

416
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:05,814
Um...

417
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:10,093
My God, I left it in my car.

418
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:36,786
- Gloria, have you seen Tanya?
- Tanya?

419
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:39,322
- Yeah, I need to see her.
- Yeah, I just saw her.

420
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:41,057
I think she's with Mrs. Pashkowitz.

421
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,825
- Mrs. Pashkowitz?
- Yeah.

422
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:44,486
Where?

423
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:48,464
- Are you okay?
- Of course, yes.

424
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:51,968
- You don't look good.
- No. It, um...

425
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:54,103
Mrs. Petersen wanted me
to tell Tanya something

426
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:56,306
and I forgot and it's important.

427
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:58,808
Well, like I said,
I think she's with Mrs. Pashkowitz.

428
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:01,010
- In her room?
- Yeah.

429
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:02,845
- Where is that again?
- Upstairs.

430
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:04,472
Thanks.

431
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,031
Oh, God.

432
00:44:57,961 --> 00:45:00,029
Now this should stop
that sock ripping incident

433
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,731
shouldn't it, Mrs. Pashkowitz? Huh?

434
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:02,799
Tanya!

435
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,935
Oh, my God. Jesus Christ, Brandi!

436
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:07,136
Mrs. Pashkowitz.

437
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:09,338
- Is she okay?
- I don't know.

438
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:10,506
Are you okay?

439
00:45:10,507 --> 00:45:14,277
No, I'm not okay.
You just cut me, you silly stupid girl.

440
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:16,212
I'm really, really sorry.

441
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,480
Oh, you're really sorry.

442
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:19,849
Sorry is not going to stop the bleeding,
is it?

443
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:23,886
I could get an infection. I could lose my toe.
People my age lose toes.

444
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:26,723
No, no, no, you're not gonna lose your toe.
It's just a little nick.

445
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:29,959
Look, missy,
whose toe are we talking about?

446
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,128
I'm gonna go get a band-aid
and something to clean it up.

447
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:34,397
You just stay right there.

448
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,866
Be sure to take your sweet time about it.

449
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:40,036
Don't worry about me
bleeding to death in here!

450
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:42,300
Where do they get these people?

451
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:44,240
Why the hell
did you sneak up on me like that?

452
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:45,708
I didn't mean to.

453
00:45:45,709 --> 00:45:47,744
- I need a favor.
- A favor?

454
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:50,513
Yeah. Can you cover for me?
I gotta take care of something.

455
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:52,482
- What?
- It's at home.

456
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:55,318
- So tell Petersen.
- I can't. I'm already in hot water with her.

457
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:56,619
Yeah, and I'm not?

458
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:59,422
Come on, just cover for me, all right?
I'll be right back.

459
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,424
Okay, what do you mean by "cover for you"?

460
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,726
You know, if Petersen asks about me...

461
00:46:03,727 --> 00:46:05,717
Oh, Brandi.

462
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,521
Okay.

463
00:46:08,031 --> 00:46:10,633
- Okay, fine, on one condition.
- What?

464
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:12,201
- You lend me your car.
- My car?

465
00:46:12,202 --> 00:46:14,403
Jeez, don't shit your pants about it.

466
00:46:14,404 --> 00:46:17,440
Yeah, it's just that
my car is not running right now.

467
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,175
- There's something wrong with it.
- Oh.

468
00:46:19,176 --> 00:46:21,144
Yeah, I have to have it looked at.

469
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:23,340
So, can you cover for me?

470
00:46:24,648 --> 00:46:26,349
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

471
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:29,051
Just hurry back
and don't leave me hanging, okay?

472
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:31,042
Cool. Thanks.

473
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:11,594
Hello, 911 emergency.

474
00:47:11,595 --> 00:47:13,323
Hello.

475
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,531
State the nature of your emergency.

476
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:17,659
I'm in a garage.

477
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:19,769
Okay, you're in a garage.

478
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:21,464
I'm in a car.

479
00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:23,406
You're in a car in a garage?

480
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:24,707
A car.

481
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:26,375
Sir, is this an emergency?

482
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:29,712
Yes. Yes, an emergency.

483
00:47:29,713 --> 00:47:33,011
Please state
the nature of your emergency, sir.

484
00:47:34,551 --> 00:47:36,552
I'm stuck.

485
00:47:36,553 --> 00:47:38,087
Okay, you're stuck.

486
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:39,919
- I'm hurt.
- Uh-huh.

487
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:42,892
In a window.

488
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:45,161
Oh. You mean in a garage window?

489
00:47:45,162 --> 00:47:47,230
In a car windshield.

490
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:48,297
I was hit.

491
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:50,266
Oh, I see. You were in an accident.

492
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:52,235
- Yes!
- Okay.

493
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:54,036
What's your location, sir?

494
00:47:55,405 --> 00:47:56,739
I'm in a garage.

495
00:47:56,740 --> 00:48:00,042
Yes, sir, you said that.
Where is this garage located, sir?

496
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:03,912
- Hello?
- I don't know!

497
00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:06,082
I'm inside of it.

498
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:08,210
Look, sir, I can...

499
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:10,686
I'm hurt.

500
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:14,351
I'm hurt.

501
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:18,186
Hello?

502
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:20,490
Hello?

503
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:23,457
Help.

504
00:48:33,343 --> 00:48:34,744
Help me.

505
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:37,509
God! God!

506
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:39,678
Help me.

507
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,478
Oh, God.

508
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:45,121
God, help me! Help me!

509
00:48:46,556 --> 00:48:48,683
Jesus!

510
00:49:33,704 --> 00:49:35,296
Help!

511
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:19,867
Help.

512
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:21,899
Help me!

513
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:26,814
We come back! We come back!

514
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:30,647
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

515
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,414
We come back.

516
00:51:34,891 --> 00:51:37,093
Oh, thank God. Thank you.

517
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:39,152
Lord Jesus, thank you.

518
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:31,270
I was asleep.

519
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:34,178
Thank God you came.

520
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:38,110
That woman who hit me, she's crazy.

521
00:52:41,424 --> 00:52:42,958
You.

522
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:45,261
Why are you doing this to me?

523
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:46,896
Do you want to kill me?

524
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:49,131
Just go to sleep, all right?

525
00:52:49,132 --> 00:52:51,033
- Help me.
- I can't!

526
00:52:51,034 --> 00:52:53,035
You can't leave me like this.

527
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:54,303
I have to leave.

528
00:52:54,304 --> 00:52:57,534
I'll tell them it was an accident. I will.

529
00:52:57,774 --> 00:53:00,242
You won't be in any trouble.

530
00:53:01,945 --> 00:53:04,572
Did you use this phone? Huh?

531
00:53:05,115 --> 00:53:07,049
No. The battery's dead.

532
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:08,847
Let me go.

533
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:12,679
Let me go. Take me to a hospital.

534
00:53:12,722 --> 00:53:14,523
You can leave me a few blocks away.

535
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:16,358
You don't even have to be there.

536
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:19,261
I don't know you.
I don't even know where I am.

537
00:53:19,262 --> 00:53:22,932
I won't tell them anything about you.
I can't tell them anything about you.

538
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:25,628
You can't leave me like this!

539
00:53:27,737 --> 00:53:29,405
I got to go.

540
00:53:29,406 --> 00:53:31,066
Please!

541
00:53:34,077 --> 00:53:35,805
Please.

542
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:38,705
You can't leave.

543
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:52,857
Christ. Oh, God!

544
00:54:18,221 --> 00:54:22,521
Oh, God. Please make it stop. Oh, God.

545
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:21,771
Rashid!

546
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:26,511
- Baby, I thought you were working.
- Honey.

547
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:29,151
Baby, listen, I'm not feeling too well,
you know.

548
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:31,053
Who is it, Rashid?

549
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:32,821
- Is somebody in your bedroom?
- Um...

550
00:56:32,822 --> 00:56:34,550
Rashid!

551
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,561
- What the fuck?
Yeah, what the fuck?

552
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:42,264
- Who the fuck is she?
- Yeah, who the fuck is she?

553
00:56:42,265 --> 00:56:45,334
- I asked you a question.
- And so did I.

554
00:56:45,335 --> 00:56:47,469
Will you fucking stop saying
what I'm saying?

555
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:49,705
Who the fuck are you
to tell me what I can say?

556
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:52,941
I'm his fucking girlfriend,
that's who the fuck I am.

557
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:55,744
In your fucking dreams, honey.
In your fucking dreams!

558
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:57,379
- In my fucking dreams?
- Yeah.

559
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:00,178
- Yeah? Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

560
00:57:04,521 --> 00:57:07,089
Who's the bitch now,
you motherfucking skank?

561
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,757
Rashid!

562
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:12,056
He's not gonna help you now,
you fucking slut.

563
00:57:13,997 --> 00:57:15,464
Ooh!

564
00:57:16,366 --> 00:57:18,128
My face!

565
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:23,029
You know what they do
with the trash? Huh?

566
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:26,975
What the fuck was that?

567
00:57:27,243 --> 00:57:30,007
One second, baby. One second.

568
00:57:35,885 --> 00:57:37,784
Fucking joke.

569
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:41,490
- I'll call you later.
- What?

570
00:57:41,491 --> 00:57:43,125
Yeah. I just have to...

571
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:44,760
You bitch-ass bastard.

572
00:57:44,761 --> 00:57:46,888
Asshole!

573
00:57:48,565 --> 00:57:53,092
What the fuck are you looking at?
You lame-ass motherfucker.

574
00:57:56,906 --> 00:57:58,841
Who the hell was that?

575
00:57:58,842 --> 00:58:02,311
Her? Yeah, yeah. Her. Well...

576
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:05,809
I'll be right back.

577
00:58:10,753 --> 00:58:12,521
Hey, baby, you want some E?

578
00:58:12,522 --> 00:58:14,256
Don't fucking give me that shit!

579
00:58:14,257 --> 00:58:16,492
- Who the fuck was she?
- She's nobody.

580
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:17,559
Nobody?

581
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:18,861
A customer needed a hit.

582
00:58:18,862 --> 00:58:20,028
- A customer?
- Yeah.

583
00:58:20,029 --> 00:58:22,264
So your customer is fucking you
or are you fucking them?

584
00:58:22,265 --> 00:58:25,598
What, me? No. Come on.

585
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:27,803
Why would you even say that?
You know it's only you.

586
00:58:27,804 --> 00:58:29,104
- Only me.
- Yeah, only you.

587
00:58:29,105 --> 00:58:30,906
- Only me.
- Yeah, yeah. It's only you, baby.

588
00:58:32,208 --> 00:58:35,511
- You okay?
- No, I'm not okay. Do I fucking look okay?

589
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:38,105
Okay, okay, baby. Okay, calm down.

590
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,784
- I need your help.
- What's wrong?

591
00:58:42,785 --> 00:58:44,253
You gotta help me.

592
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:46,915
Yeah, sure. Sure, baby. Sure, baby.

593
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:50,025
Help you with what?

594
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:52,153
It's in my garage.

595
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:23,242
What the fuck?

596
01:00:24,387 --> 01:00:26,320
He's the guy I hit.

597
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:28,880
- The homeless guy.
- Yeah.

598
01:00:30,193 --> 01:00:32,394
I thought you said you hit a guy.

599
01:00:32,395 --> 01:00:33,895
Yeah, he's the guy.

600
01:00:33,896 --> 01:00:36,498
Yeah, but you didn't say you hit a guy
and brought him home with you.

601
01:00:36,499 --> 01:00:38,261
Help me.

602
01:00:39,235 --> 01:00:41,436
Dude, you're still alive?

603
01:00:41,437 --> 01:00:42,904
Help me.

604
01:00:42,905 --> 01:00:44,539
This is why I need your help.

605
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:46,371
Help me.

606
01:00:46,843 --> 01:00:49,743
This is bullshit, man. Bullshit!

607
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:52,914
Look, I don't know what to do with him.
This is why I need your help.

608
01:00:52,915 --> 01:00:54,416
My help?

609
01:00:54,417 --> 01:00:56,852
- Yeah, you said you've done this before.
- What?

610
01:00:56,853 --> 01:00:58,553
Get rid of people.

611
01:00:58,554 --> 01:01:00,351
Oh, yeah, right.

612
01:01:02,425 --> 01:01:06,595
Here's an idea.
You ever thought of calling 911?

613
01:01:06,596 --> 01:01:08,463
I can't do that, okay?

614
01:01:08,464 --> 01:01:10,699
- They'll know I hit him.
- Yeah.

615
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:12,834
I can't do that. This wasrt even my fault.

616
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:14,802
- It wasrt?
- No!

617
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:20,742
Look, you said
you could get rid of him, right?

618
01:01:20,743 --> 01:01:23,145
You said you could do it.
You said it would be easy.

619
01:01:23,146 --> 01:01:26,274
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's easy. Easy as shit.

620
01:01:28,551 --> 01:01:31,019
I don't do that kind of thing for free,
you know?

621
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:33,288
- That shit costs.
- Costs?

622
01:01:33,289 --> 01:01:35,390
Yeah, it's gonna cost big time.

623
01:01:35,391 --> 01:01:36,725
You want me to pay you?

624
01:01:36,726 --> 01:01:40,395
Hey, baby, I know where you live,
you know what I'm saying?

625
01:01:40,396 --> 01:01:43,194
Yeah. Yeah, babe.

626
01:01:43,332 --> 01:01:45,801
And I know where you live,
know what I'm saying?

627
01:01:45,802 --> 01:01:47,869
- Huh?
- Come on, Rashid!

628
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:51,533
All the shit you got at your place.
One phone call.

629
01:01:52,241 --> 01:01:54,743
What is this, kindergarten?
You gonna tell on me?

630
01:01:54,744 --> 01:01:55,944
Yeah.

631
01:01:55,945 --> 01:02:00,472
Yeah, I will. I swear to God I will.
If you don't help me with this, I will.

632
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:03,147
Fuck, man!

633
01:02:06,756 --> 01:02:09,781
Did he get out of the car?

634
01:02:10,593 --> 01:02:12,761
Yeah, I don't know how.

635
01:02:12,762 --> 01:02:14,524
Oh, shit.

636
01:02:14,764 --> 01:02:18,199
- We'd better tie him up.
- Tie him up?

637
01:02:19,335 --> 01:02:21,303
You don't want him
crawling around everywhere.

638
01:02:21,304 --> 01:02:24,568
- No.
- Then I guess we tie him up! Huh?

639
01:02:30,046 --> 01:02:32,377
I think he passed out.

640
01:02:33,683 --> 01:02:37,175
Man, this guy is covered with blood
and dirt and crap.

641
01:02:38,221 --> 01:02:39,915
Um...

642
01:02:40,389 --> 01:02:43,255
You got something we can wrap him up in?

643
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:45,694
I don't know. What?

644
01:02:45,695 --> 01:02:48,322
I don't know, plastic?

645
01:02:54,403 --> 01:02:55,904
This guy ain't going nowhere.

646
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:58,874
Oh, shit!
Are you guys in there?

647
01:03:00,877 --> 01:03:02,776
Oh, fuck.

648
01:03:02,912 --> 01:03:06,248
Oh, my God. Holy shit, man.
What the hell happened?

649
01:03:06,249 --> 01:03:08,049
- I was in kind of an accident.
- Kind of?

650
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:09,217
Yeah.

651
01:03:09,218 --> 01:03:10,585
Look, why don't we go in the house, huh?

652
01:03:10,586 --> 01:03:12,587
Dude, this looks real bad.

653
01:03:12,588 --> 01:03:14,022
Yeah, it's kind of fucked up, right?

654
01:03:14,023 --> 01:03:16,855
- Major.
- Come on, let's go in the house.

655
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:20,694
Your car, what happened to it?

656
01:03:21,364 --> 01:03:24,366
- It was an accident.
- I got that. What happened?

657
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:26,334
You know what it was?

658
01:03:27,703 --> 01:03:31,730
What's going on with you two?
What the hell happened to your car?

659
01:03:31,874 --> 01:03:33,208
It was weird.

660
01:03:33,209 --> 01:03:34,709
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

661
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:36,578
Just wait inside. Everything is...
Just go inside.

662
01:03:36,579 --> 01:03:38,239
Okay.

663
01:03:44,754 --> 01:03:46,421
So what happened?

664
01:03:46,422 --> 01:03:47,980
Uh...

665
01:03:48,057 --> 01:03:51,492
- Brandi, you didn't tell her?
- No, I didn't tell her.

666
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:53,428
Brandi hit something.

667
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:55,831
Well, what? I mean,
there's blood all over the windshield.

668
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:57,465
Yeah, I hit something.

669
01:03:57,466 --> 01:03:58,900
A deer.

670
01:03:58,901 --> 01:04:00,569
A deer?

671
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:03,664
Yeah, it just came out of nowhere, didn't it?

672
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:07,576
Yeah, it did. Out of nowhere.
Suddenly there it was.

673
01:04:07,577 --> 01:04:09,977
Oh, my God, that's horrible.

674
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:13,181
Oh, my God, those goddamn fucking deer.

675
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:14,916
Crazy thing, ain't it?
- Oh, my goodness.

676
01:04:14,917 --> 01:04:18,854
You know, my aunt hit one once,
you know, God.

677
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:21,356
Thank you.
Brandi, you could have been killed.

678
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:23,758
- Yeah, it's true.
- Yeah, yeah, I could have.

679
01:04:23,759 --> 01:04:26,193
So why didn't you tell me?

680
01:04:26,229 --> 01:04:29,064
- You mean about the accident?
- Of course.

681
01:04:29,065 --> 01:04:31,566
I don't know.
I was just too freaked.

682
01:04:31,567 --> 01:04:35,969
Oh, hon, yeah. I can just imagine.

683
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:41,142
I mean, something like this that happens
to you and it's not even your fault.

684
01:04:41,143 --> 01:04:44,009
- And you could have been killed.
- BRANDl: Yeah.

685
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:46,275
You know,

686
01:04:46,816 --> 01:04:49,011
this is some bullshit.

687
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:59,156
So, did you kill him?

688
01:04:59,362 --> 01:05:01,296
- Kill him?
- Yeah, the deer.

689
01:05:01,297 --> 01:05:02,957
Uh...

690
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:08,136
She doesn't know.
It kind of crawled away, didn't it?

691
01:05:08,137 --> 01:05:09,738
Yeah, it did.

692
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,763
Deer can crawl?

693
01:05:12,508 --> 01:05:14,309
Tanya, why are you here?

694
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:16,141
Oh, right.

695
01:05:17,613 --> 01:05:21,082
Okay, look, you never came back to work.

696
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:24,185
And I tried calling your home
and I tried calling your cell

697
01:05:24,186 --> 01:05:26,654
and there was no answer.

698
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:31,159
- Petersen knows that you split.
- She does?

699
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:32,594
Look, I thought you were covering for me.

700
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:35,030
I tried, but Mr. Binckley
started asking for you

701
01:05:35,031 --> 01:05:37,032
and then Petersen,
she starts looking around for you,

702
01:05:37,033 --> 01:05:39,167
then she starts asking me and...

703
01:05:39,168 --> 01:05:40,468
- You know what?
- Fuck.

704
01:05:40,469 --> 01:05:42,504
- She's really pissed off.
- Fuck.

705
01:05:42,505 --> 01:05:45,540
- But I didn't tell her that you went home.
- Shit!

706
01:05:45,541 --> 01:05:48,976
She just knows that you're gone. Sorry.

707
01:05:49,712 --> 01:05:52,814
Yo, Rashid, can you give me a lift?

708
01:05:52,815 --> 01:05:54,416
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

709
01:05:54,417 --> 01:05:55,684
- Well...
- Come on, man.

710
01:05:55,685 --> 01:05:58,286
I had to take the fucking bus to get here.
It took me an hour.

711
01:05:58,287 --> 01:06:00,989
Yeah, but, you know,
we're kind of in the middle of something.

712
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:03,458
You know what I'm saying?

713
01:06:03,492 --> 01:06:04,859
Oh. Ew.

714
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:07,851
Okay. Well, do you have any things on you?

715
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:10,288
Yeah, always.

716
01:06:14,837 --> 01:06:16,804
- Here.
- Whoa.

717
01:06:17,206 --> 01:06:19,140
Thank you.

718
01:06:22,578 --> 01:06:27,182
But, you know,
I don't get paid until next week.

719
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:30,311
- So you owe me.
- Yeah, I owe you.

720
01:06:33,189 --> 01:06:34,883
Tanya.
- Hmm?

721
01:06:34,924 --> 01:06:36,482
Bye.

722
01:06:36,859 --> 01:06:37,959
Oh.

723
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:39,893
Okay. Okay.

724
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:52,273
- Yo, Brandi, you going to work tomorrow?
- No.

725
01:06:52,274 --> 01:06:54,876
You better come up with something good
for Petersen on Monday.

726
01:06:54,877 --> 01:06:57,379
- That bitch is pissed.
- Yeah, you said.

727
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:58,747
You know what?

728
01:06:58,748 --> 01:07:01,248
I just can't believe
that thing about the deer.

729
01:07:03,652 --> 01:07:05,053
What do you mean?

730
01:07:05,054 --> 01:07:08,556
Oh, man, you are so lucky.
I mean, you really could have been killed.

731
01:07:08,557 --> 01:07:10,325
- I am lucky.
- Yeah.

732
01:07:10,326 --> 01:07:12,427
Okay. I'll see you later.

733
01:07:12,428 --> 01:07:14,589
- All right.
- Bye.

734
01:07:16,098 --> 01:07:19,367
- Fuck! Fuck! God damn it!
- Be cool, baby. Be cool.

735
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:20,869
What the hell are we gonna do?

736
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,637
- She fucking saw.
- She saw the car.

737
01:07:22,638 --> 01:07:25,206
- She didn't see the body, she saw the car.
- Yeah.

738
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:27,509
All you have to do is fix the fucking window.

739
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:30,845
Wait a minute.
There's blood on the seats in the car.

740
01:07:30,846 --> 01:07:33,815
- Seat covers.
- Seat covers?

741
01:07:33,816 --> 01:07:35,984
All we have to do is get rid of him, right?

742
01:07:35,985 --> 01:07:37,152
Yeah.

743
01:07:37,153 --> 01:07:39,687
So we wait till dark,
dump his ass in the park.

744
01:07:39,688 --> 01:07:41,022
- What, and that's it?
- That's it.

745
01:07:41,023 --> 01:07:43,548
Out of sight, out of mind.

746
01:07:43,759 --> 01:07:47,028
Baby, I've done shit like this
a thousand times. It's no big deal.

747
01:07:47,029 --> 01:07:48,496
A thousand times?

748
01:07:48,497 --> 01:07:52,467
Well, not really a thousand times.
Come on, you know what I mean.

749
01:07:52,468 --> 01:07:53,935
Look.

750
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:59,170
We chill out for a few hours,
wait till dark, go and do the deed.

751
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:02,339
You know what I mean?

752
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:04,937
Okay.

753
01:08:06,182 --> 01:08:07,979
Good girl.

754
01:08:12,354 --> 01:08:14,722
Where are you going, baby girl?

755
01:08:14,723 --> 01:08:17,589
Dog, dog. Princess!

756
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:20,862
Princess, where are you?

757
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:22,796
Princess! Princess!

758
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:25,361
Princess!

759
01:08:28,804 --> 01:08:31,534
Princess, you come here right now.

760
01:09:08,577 --> 01:09:10,305
Princess?

761
01:09:10,713 --> 01:09:12,475
Princess?

762
01:09:12,715 --> 01:09:15,308
Princess, where are you? Princess?

763
01:09:15,451 --> 01:09:18,112
Princess, you come here. Princess?

764
01:09:18,621 --> 01:09:20,188
Princess?

765
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:23,658
Princess? There you are.
You naughty, naughty thing, you.

766
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:27,925
You're a naughty little baby dog, aren't you?
Arert you? Yes, you are.

767
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:31,733
Help me! Help me, please!

768
01:09:31,734 --> 01:09:35,470
Yes, you are. You're a naughty little girl.
What's got into you?

769
01:09:37,106 --> 01:09:38,766
Oh, my God.

770
01:09:39,909 --> 01:09:41,843
Where have you been?

771
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:44,479
You've been in the garbage again,
haven't you?

772
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:47,081
Look. Now Daddy's got to go
get us all cleaned up,

773
01:09:47,082 --> 01:09:49,846
you naughty, naughty thing, you.

774
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:54,747
Help me. I need help. Please! Fuck!

775
01:10:03,432 --> 01:10:06,234
- So how are you gonna do it?
- Do what?

776
01:10:06,235 --> 01:10:07,997
Get rid of him.

777
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:10,438
Listen, the guy's not Superman, is he?

778
01:10:10,439 --> 01:10:12,240
I mean, how much longer
do you think he's gonna live?

779
01:10:12,241 --> 01:10:14,275
You fucked him up pretty bad, babe.

780
01:10:14,276 --> 01:10:15,710
You said you could do it.

781
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:17,745
Yeah, yeah, I can do it.

782
01:10:17,746 --> 01:10:20,441
- So then how?
- How?

783
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:22,317
Yeah, you said you could get rid of him,

784
01:10:22,318 --> 01:10:24,652
so why can't you tell me
how you're gonna get rid of him?

785
01:10:24,653 --> 01:10:26,554
You really want to know
how I'm gonna do it?

786
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:28,790
- Yes.
- You really want to know?

787
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:30,091
That's what I asked you!

788
01:10:30,092 --> 01:10:33,789
You want to know? Okay.
Wait right here. Just wait.

789
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:02,390
You want to know how I'm gonna do it?

790
01:11:02,391 --> 01:11:05,593
How about doing it with this?
Think this will do it?

791
01:11:05,594 --> 01:11:06,861
Oh, yeah, great.

792
01:11:06,862 --> 01:11:09,830
You want to wake up
the whole neighborhood?

793
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:12,631
Oh, right.

794
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:23,678
How about we smother his ass?
Do you think that'll do it?

795
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:26,147
Just stop talking and do it.

796
01:11:26,148 --> 01:11:27,482
What, you want me to do it now?

797
01:11:27,483 --> 01:11:29,917
Yes. Do it now. It's dark outside.

798
01:11:29,918 --> 01:11:31,886
Who knows
who else is gonna come around here.

799
01:11:31,887 --> 01:11:34,188
I've already got to deal with Tanya
and she's got a big mouth.

800
01:11:34,189 --> 01:11:35,690
Okay, okay, I'll do it now

801
01:11:35,691 --> 01:11:40,025
and get this motherfucking thing over with
just to shut you up! Christ!

802
01:11:44,933 --> 01:11:46,491
Let me have your car keys.

803
01:11:50,105 --> 01:11:51,806
My car keys? Why?

804
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:54,876
- So I can put him in your trunk.
- My trunk?

805
01:11:54,877 --> 01:11:58,946
We'll get rid of him and the car in the park.
We'll burn the fucker.

806
01:11:58,947 --> 01:12:00,948
You want to burn my car now?

807
01:12:00,949 --> 01:12:04,052
I thought you said we could fix the window
and put seat covers on.

808
01:12:04,053 --> 01:12:05,920
Seat covers? Are you fucking nuts?

809
01:12:05,921 --> 01:12:09,490
It's got his blood everywhere.
Look what happened to OJ.

810
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:10,825
Yeah, but didn't OJ go free?

811
01:12:10,826 --> 01:12:12,026
That's not the point.

812
01:12:12,027 --> 01:12:15,394
His blood is everywhere.
You can't get rid of blood.

813
01:12:16,298 --> 01:12:18,425
Give me the keys.

814
01:12:19,468 --> 01:12:24,530
You can get another goddamn car.
I mean, you're getting a promotion, right?

815
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:07,276
You still alive, man?

816
01:13:43,051 --> 01:13:44,916
He shot him.

817
01:13:48,891 --> 01:13:51,222
Motherfucker!

818
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:14,008
Oh, no, he's not leaving now.

819
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:26,513
Rashid?

820
01:15:30,058 --> 01:15:31,923
Oh, my God.

821
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:40,157
Help!

822
01:16:42,965 --> 01:16:44,693
Help!

823
01:16:46,068 --> 01:16:47,660
Stop.

824
01:16:48,804 --> 01:16:50,271
Stop!

825
01:16:52,207 --> 01:16:53,935
I'm out.

826
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:58,139
I'm out.

827
01:16:59,047 --> 01:17:02,277
Just let me go. That's all you got to do.

828
01:17:04,219 --> 01:17:06,243
Just let me go.

829
01:17:06,421 --> 01:17:08,354
I said stop.

830
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:10,082
Stop!

831
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:14,095
What the fuck is wrong with you?

832
01:18:27,002 --> 01:18:30,171
- What are you doing?
- What am I doing?

833
01:18:30,172 --> 01:18:33,941
I'm not doing anything. You are.
You're doing it.

834
01:18:33,942 --> 01:18:37,036
You started it and now you're finishing it.

835
01:18:37,779 --> 01:18:39,405
What?

836
01:18:39,414 --> 01:18:43,984
You broke in. You're crazy.
You wanted to steal my car.

837
01:18:43,985 --> 01:18:46,353
But Rashid found you and he fought you.

838
01:18:46,354 --> 01:18:50,585
He broke your leg,
but you kept fighting and you killed him.

839
01:18:50,759 --> 01:18:54,695
And then you got this gas.
You got this gas to burn Rashid's body

840
01:18:54,696 --> 01:18:56,797
but the fire got out of control

841
01:18:56,798 --> 01:18:59,333
and it burned you and the car
and the garage and everything!

842
01:18:59,334 --> 01:19:02,064
You did it! You did all of it!

843
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:34,932
Help me. Help me, please.

844
01:19:35,537 --> 01:19:37,004
Help me.

845
01:19:37,706 --> 01:19:40,731
- Help you?
- Help me.

846
01:19:50,852 --> 01:19:52,683
Please?

847
01:20:06,668 --> 01:20:08,226
No.

848
01:20:09,271 --> 01:20:11,102
Help me, please.

849
01:20:11,606 --> 01:20:13,474
Why didn't you help me?

850
01:20:13,475 --> 01:20:14,842
I don't know.

851
01:20:14,843 --> 01:20:16,710
Why didn't you let me go?

852
01:20:16,711 --> 01:20:18,913
I don't know. I'm sorry.

853
01:20:18,914 --> 01:20:23,009
I'm sorry. Please, don't do it. Please!

854
01:20:23,451 --> 01:20:25,077
Please.

855
01:20:26,288 --> 01:20:28,949
Please. Please don't do it.

856
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:36,315
Pedro! Pedro!

857
01:21:40,695 --> 01:21:43,686
Somebody in there.
