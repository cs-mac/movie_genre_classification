1
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:28,794
[Piano: Classical]

2
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:17,709
This is like Holy Grail of cinema.

3
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:20,507
These are where Maya kept her films...

4
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:23,013
and actually there are films inside...

5
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:26,108
and we don't even know what they are.

6
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,016
This is one of the archives where...

7
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:38,086
one can still make
discoveries, and one can get...

8
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:41,964
excited and in ecstasy!

9
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,970
[Chuckles]

10
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,806
There may be some very
interesting discoveries.

11
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:46,222
This is the first
picture I took of Maya.

12
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:51,533
It must have been a few days
after we met in Hollywood.

13
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:54,038
It's already faded a little.

14
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:58,300
I was fascinated by her face.

15
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:03,214
kind of exotic.

16
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:13,315
Maya wasn't always Maya.

17
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:15,917
She used to be called Eleanora.

18
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:21,395
Her mother used to call
her Elinka in Russian.

19
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:24,993
She confided in me that she
was unhappy about her name...

20
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:27,834
and she asked me once
to find a name for her.

21
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:32,071
So I just went to a library and
looked through a lot of books...

22
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:35,579
mainly books on mythology.

23
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:38,708
I came across the name Maya
in different connections...

24
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:41,252
for instance, with water.

25
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:46,155
But Maya also was the
name of mother of Buddha.

26
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:49,057
In Hinduism, Maya was
the name of a goddess...

27
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:51,528
who holds a veil in front of our eyes...

28
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:56,024
a veil of illusion, which
prevents us from seeing...

29
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:59,036
the spiritual reality behind it.

30
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,223
[Maya Deren] I was a poet
before I was a filmmaker...

31
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,231
and I was a very poor poet...

32
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,268
because I thought in terms of images.

33
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,329
What existed as essentially a
visual experience in my mind...

34
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,273
poetry was an effort to
put it into verbal terms.

35
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:40,312
When I got a camera in my
hand, it was like coming home.

36
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:43,473
It was like doing what I always
wanted to do without the need...

37
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,416
to translate it into a verbal form.

38
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:26,917
[Woman] She could have been a dancer...

39
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:29,249
but that would have taken
full-time work with us.

40
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:33,951
And so, she stayed being a
kind of a personal secretary.

41
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,119
You know, that sort of thing.

42
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:44,095
I had to keep my eye on
Maya at times, you know...

43
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:47,468
because I don't think I
had a star complex at all...

44
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:50,098
but I had to remind her now and then...

45
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:53,838
we were in Hollywood to begin...

46
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:56,437
kind of a new career for the company.

47
00:06:56,549 --> 00:07:01,816
Frequently I would ask some of
the Hollywood people to come in.

48
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:05,448
And Maya was wonderful at
meeting them at the door...

49
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:09,153
and introductions and seating
them, and so forth and so on.

50
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,663
But the gleam in her eye...

51
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:16,462
when the drummers took their positions
and began to play, you know...

52
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:20,767
And we'd have our exercise.
Always the drums we were.

53
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:26,038
Well, Maya had a habit of... She
was extremely well built as far...

54
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:30,047
robust, you know... and she'd sit there.

55
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:35,280
Usually her-her little simple frocks
were quite low cut, in the front anyway.

56
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:37,879
And after a while she
couldn't stand it...

57
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,720
and you could just feel it
growing and growing in her.

58
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,295
And she turned, I remember...
Her favorite thing was to say...

59
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,990
"How can you sit still?"

60
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:49,465
You know? And then she'd
start in on this sort.

61
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:51,469
I was wild, because I had to find...

62
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,596
Little by little, I had
to stop it, of course.

63
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:57,198
I couldn't have that at
all with these impresarios.

64
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:01,474
But who knows? Maybe she helped
us get our Hollywood position.

65
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:17,858
The drums really took her over.

66
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:20,728
She was possessed by rhythm.

67
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,734
And you could see it without drums,
without sound or anything else...

68
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,964
and in the way she handled her body.

69
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:35,073
[Deren] If I did not live in a time when
the film was accessible to me as a medium...

70
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,706
I would have been a dancer,
perhaps, or a singer.

71
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,911
My reason for creating them is
almost as if I would dance...

72
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,580
except this is a much
more marvelous dance.

73
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:47,455
It's because in film, I
can make the world dance.

74
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,562
Actually, this picture was
not planned for the film.

75
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:01,640
I just made it in a spur of the moment.

76
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:04,801
I liked the reflections of the trees...

77
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:07,209
in the glass in front of her.

78
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:10,373
Later on we used to call
it my Botticelli picture...

79
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:13,418
because it reminded us
of Italian Renaissance.

80
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:42,776
And this one was taken in New York...

81
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:47,717
with our cat, Glamour Girl,
that came with us from Hollywood.

82
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:54,759
This was our apartment in
Greenwich Village in Morton Street.

83
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:09,334
We had kind of a studio apartment.

84
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:14,643
We used it a lot...

85
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:19,075
as a location for shooting.

86
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:25,081
It had very nice light.

87
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:27,386
Large windows to the south.

88
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:32,487
And our cats were with us, of course.

89
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,159
Maya loved cats.

90
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:45,005
Maya liked mirrors very much...

91
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:49,104
and used the idea of a
mirror often in her writing.

92
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,844
Also, the film ends
with a broken mirror.

93
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,693
Maya was born Eleanora Derenkowski...

94
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:40,925
beautiful name... in 1917...

95
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:44,298
the year of the Russian
revolution, in Russia...

96
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:46,963
in Kiev, the great, great
capital of the Ukraine.

97
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,738
She came out of a very
privileged situation.

98
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:57,179
Most Jews did not live in the cities...

99
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:59,183
but there were a good number of them.

100
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:02,584
What was special about the
Derens, the Derenkowskies...

101
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:05,714
is that both parents were
so very highly educated...

102
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:08,658
particularly her father,
who was a psychiatrist.

103
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:11,161
And they then emigrated
several years later...

104
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:13,288
as many Jews did, to New York.

105
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:19,435
I do know how very deeply, profoundly...

106
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:23,531
Maya loved her father
and was influenced by him.

107
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:41,908
[Deren] I am not greedy.

108
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:46,747
I do not seek to possess the
major portion of your days.

109
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:52,219
I am content if, on
those rare occasions...

110
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:56,488
whose truth can be
stated only by poetry...

111
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:59,962
you will perhaps recall an image...

112
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:03,796
even only the aura of my films.

113
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:23,318
[Man] She came from the sea. If
you've ever seen her film At Land...

114
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,322
she comes out of the sea.

115
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:28,120
In her mind, she was a sea creature.

116
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,897
Maya's bedroom was an underwater world.

117
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:36,263
It was like a grotto under the sea...

118
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:39,929
and it was full of very
beautiful objects...

119
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:42,564
shells, coral...

120
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:46,441
and on the ceiling, there was
a very unusual large painting...

121
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:48,638
of underwater creatures.

122
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:51,409
And in the normal light,
you would see that...

123
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:53,417
but when the lights were turned off...

124
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,818
it turned out it was painted
with phosphorescent paint...

125
00:15:56,922 --> 00:16:00,915
and so suddenly it came to
life with different colors...

126
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:04,860
and you really felt as if you
were under the sea at night...

127
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,730
surrounded by the other
creatures of the sea.

128
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:13,464
It was an apartment
of love and of beauty.

129
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:15,665
It was predominantly blue.

130
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:17,935
That was her favorite color.

131
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:33,857
[Deren] What I do in my films...

132
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:37,759
is very... oh, I think
very distinctively...

133
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:39,797
I think they are the films of a woman...

134
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:43,925
and I think that their
characteristic time quality...

135
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:46,766
is the time quality of a woman.

136
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:49,340
I think that the strength of men...

137
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:51,932
is their great sense of immediacy.

138
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:55,639
They are a "now" creature...

139
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:59,548
and a woman has strength to
wait, because she's had to wait.

140
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:02,484
She has to wait nine months
for the concept of a child.

141
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:06,786
Time is built into her body
in the sense of becomingness.

142
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:11,056
And she sees everything
in terms of it being...

143
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:13,063
in the stage of becoming.

144
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:16,896
She raises a child knowing
not what it is at any moment...

145
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:19,596
but seeing always the
person that it will become.

146
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,003
Her whole life from
her very beginning...

147
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:25,338
it's built into her...
is the sense of becoming.

148
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:29,710
Now, in any time form, this
is a very important sense.

149
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:34,946
I think that my films putting
as much stress as they do...

150
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:38,546
upon the constant metamorphosis...

151
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:40,887
one image is always becoming another.

152
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:43,985
That is, it is what is happening
that is important in my films...

153
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:45,996
not what is at any moment.

154
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:48,430
This is a woman's time sense...

155
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:53,233
and I think it happens more in my
films than in almost anyone else's.

156
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:26,304
Hella Heyman was a young
still photographer...

157
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:28,373
living in Los Angeles.

158
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:31,534
She was very close friends with
a woman named Galka Scheyer.

159
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:34,407
And Galka was an art dealer.

160
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:39,109
She worked with the
paintings of four important...

161
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:42,847
and rather unknown painters
at that time in America...

162
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:47,517
and that was Klee, Feininger,
Kandinsky and Jawlenski.

163
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:52,222
She was also... Galka...
a friend of Maya and Sasha.

164
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:55,858
And that's how the friendship
between the three started.

165
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:59,096
Galka was the focal
point, in a certain sense.

166
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:01,604
Hella came to New York
at a certain period...

167
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:04,471
and stayed with Maya and
Sasha in Morton Street.

168
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:09,206
And at that point, At
Land was germinating.

169
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:12,408
And as always in Maya's films...

170
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,986
one person did not have one function.

171
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:17,487
One person did as much as was needed.

172
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:21,958
Hella was camerawoman, coached
by Sasha, incidentally...

173
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:25,325
grip, actress, whatever.

174
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,092
In the scene in At Land at the beach...

175
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,225
where there is a chess game going on...

176
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:33,668
the human counterparts for those,
the black and the white figure...

177
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:37,936
Hella is the black-haired
woman in that chess game.

178
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:41,673
They remained friends for
quite a long while... in fact...

179
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,443
until the divorce
between Sasha and Maya...

180
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:49,282
and eventually the
marriage of Sasha and Hella.

181
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:32,691
[Deren] I intended it almost
as a mythological statement...

182
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,164
in the sense that folktales
are mythological...

183
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:37,963
archetypal statements.

184
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,130
The girl in the film is
not a personal person.

185
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,640
She's a personage.

186
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:05,155
[Arsham] Maya had several projects
that were for some reasons abandoned.

187
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,960
And the one that most interested me...

188
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:11,524
was to be a film about children's games.

189
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:14,606
For her, it was...

190
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:16,765
the ritual involved in these games.

191
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,775
And they are very ritualistic...

192
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:21,846
and full of the kind of gesture
that has specific meaning.

193
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:26,407
And to learn from Maya...

194
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:29,385
that this was universal
was a revelation.

195
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:32,218
I was a New York street kid. I knew
nothing about what was happening...

196
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:34,224
elsewhere in the world.

197
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:38,456
But I played with great affection...

198
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:42,124
hopscotch, jump rope, jacks...

199
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:46,261
Jacks is a game... It certainly has
different names elsewhere in the world...

200
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:50,432
but it was played, for example, by
my mother in Russia as a young girl.

201
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:06,457
[Woman] She was unusually
dressed for those days.

202
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:09,459
I think she was just a
woman ahead of her time...

203
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:14,931
because many years later, I would often see
somebody dressed just exactly like her...

204
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:17,160
even think maybe it was she...

205
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:22,730
until she turned around and then realized
that this was... this was her style.

206
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:26,038
The clothes were this-this...

207
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:28,704
European style of embroidered blouse...

208
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:31,078
that could be worn off the shoulder...

209
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:34,482
and it was like folksy folk clothes...

210
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:36,611
with always... with a long dirndl skirt.

211
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:40,249
It may be that she had
the-the body type...

212
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:44,489
of sort of like heavy,
heavy hips and heavy legs...

213
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:47,963
and certainly that kind of
skirt looked much better on her.

214
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:51,934
And her hair, of course...
She did have very curly hair...

215
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:56,599
which, instead of cutting it off,
as most of us would have done...

216
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,608
she just let it be.

217
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:02,146
So à la the '60s, with
flower children and stuff.

218
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:05,216
In other words, she really
looked like a flower child...

219
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:08,115
but this was not the
'60s, this was the '40s.

220
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:02,435
[Hammid] Since Maya had her
own experience with dancing...

221
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:05,510
she wanted to use film to express...

222
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,408
dance ideas in a new way...

223
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:12,108
by using the film
technique of editing...

224
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:14,685
to free the dancer from gravity...

225
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:17,346
so that the dancer would
seem to be floating...

226
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,515
by his own power.

227
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:22,889
In New York, she found a
young dancer, Talley Beatty...

228
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:27,055
who was willing to cooperate for free.

229
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:31,295
In it we used slow motion...

230
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:35,897
and then we hired a cheap
16-millimeter slow-motion camera...

231
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:38,066
and used that.

232
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:58,594
[Deren] It isn't a problem
of choreographing a dancer.

233
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:01,029
It's a problem of
choreographing whatever it is...

234
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:03,100
that you have in that frame...

235
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:05,761
including the space...

236
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:09,102
the trees, the animate
or even inanimate objects.

237
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:14,008
And at that moment, this is
where the film choreographer...

238
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:17,343
departs a little bit from
the dance choreographer...

239
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:19,610
and that is what I attempted to do...

240
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:22,710
in A Study in Choreography for Camera.

241
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:26,814
I retitled it, actually, Pas de Deux...

242
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:29,519
because what happens there is that
although you see only one dancer...

243
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:33,189
the camera is as
partner to that dancer...

244
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:37,758
and carries him or accelerates him...

245
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,429
as a partner would
do to the ballerina...

246
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,406
making possible
progressions and movements...

247
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:46,773
that are impossible to
the individual figure.

248
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:56,037
Everything that Maya did in any
of her other films is there...

249
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:59,981
the condensation, the intensity...

250
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:04,317
and perfection as a...
as a film like a poem...

251
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:06,515
something that goes...

252
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:12,489
Maya said the prose is
narrative-horizontal...

253
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:14,895
and poetry, song is vertical.

254
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,834
It reaches detail after
detail after detail.

255
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:21,269
After two minutes and a
half it reaches the point...

256
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:25,139
that is that intensity from
which it cannot go any further.

257
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:29,270
Everything is set, exhausted,
the point made, perfect.

258
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:32,077
[Film Projector Whirring]

259
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:57,636
[Man] As a kid, first
I got a slide projector.

260
00:27:57,742 --> 00:28:00,267
Then I got a 9
1/2-millimeter projector.

261
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:03,609
Then I attended the
screenings of the cine-club...

262
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:06,980
at the Urania in Vienna.

263
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:10,179
So it was pretty clear that...

264
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:13,485
you know, I was involved with film.

265
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:16,082
And then what happened was...

266
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:19,163
when I had to leave Austria...

267
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:23,132
because Hitler didn't
like... didn't like me...

268
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:27,068
I came to the United
States, and again...

269
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:30,664
really, even though I had to work...

270
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:34,905
I kept on thinking about
what I could do about film...

271
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:39,541
and whether it wouldn't be a nice
idea perhaps to start a cine-club.

272
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:45,487
But then there was this
really, like, a revelation...

273
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:48,354
namely, there was an
announcement in the papers...

274
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:52,328
that a woman who I never
had heard of, Maya Deren...

275
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:56,730
would present her films at
the Provincetown Playhouse.

276
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:59,099
They had never shown films before there.

277
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:02,696
The whole idea of taking
over regular theater...

278
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:05,071
was very enticing to me.

279
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:10,239
And I decided that, yes,
I should do the same.

280
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:14,382
You know, I felt that I was
in the presence, really...

281
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:17,319
of a new kind of talent...

282
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,617
somebody who had absorbed...

283
00:29:19,724 --> 00:29:25,185
the 20th-century revelations
and achievements...

284
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:28,322
in terms of dream theory.

285
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:06,030
Dreams are essentially silent.

286
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:10,631
This was a very important
element in the films to me...

287
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:12,437
the silence.

288
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:16,742
And here was somebody who was able
to represent this dream reality...

289
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:19,817
this inner reality, on film.

290
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:21,818
Wonderful.

291
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:50,609
[Woman] I felt so close with
Sasha, more than with anybody else.

292
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:53,980
Though Hella and I...

293
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:58,613
used to sit to the side
and talk about Sasha...

294
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:02,284
and say that we were gonna marry him.

295
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:06,887
So then we finally came to the conclusion
that Hella would marry him first...

296
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:09,728
and then I would marry
him in the next life.

297
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:13,361
So that was it. But my
recollection of Sasha...

298
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:15,803
is-is indescribable.

299
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:20,742
He was such a sweet and gentle soul.

300
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:30,678
She was so busy and so involved
in the very essence of living...

301
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:35,851
that many things passed her
by, dangerous and otherwise.

302
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:39,919
And I think that Sasha had...

303
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:43,967
a more... a more precise
way of looking at things.

304
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:47,560
So I think he was a great
balance for her and a great...

305
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:50,197
a great source of-of
spiritual, you know...

306
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:53,072
of the true spiritual
quality that one needs...

307
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:57,011
particularly in a person
of Maya's temperament.

308
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:06,215
I came from Trinidad
at five years of age...

309
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:11,084
and later on I found out that Maya had come
from her country at five years of age...

310
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:13,714
and on a boat also.

311
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:18,455
So that was a commonality that
might not have been expressed...

312
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:20,963
but was felt...

313
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:24,091
by some psychic mean
between the two of us.

314
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:35,809
And maybe she saw, you know,
in this mirror of one's self...

315
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:39,815
that she saw this particular person
when she came into this country.

316
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:43,944
Because coming here at that young age...

317
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:47,149
unless you have experienced
it, you don't know what it is.

318
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:49,488
Everything is new to you...

319
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:52,654
and everything is so
frightening to you...

320
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:57,326
people, the places, the way
people talk, the way they act.

321
00:33:57,435 --> 00:34:02,737
And then you had to speak
English to become an American.

322
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:07,903
And that was the goal: that
you'd become American, you know.

323
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:39,742
I don't remember any written material...

324
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:42,472
that she gave to prepare.

325
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,845
She talked, as usual,
and she used words...

326
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:48,077
to bring forth a certain choreography.

327
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:52,213
But then she had a-a very
experienced dancer in Frank...

328
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:54,655
and then she allowed us to move freely.

329
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:43,530
And many people feel
that death is a release...

330
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:46,007
and you go into something else.

331
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,544
I had no feelings about that.

332
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:51,444
There was never any question in my mind.

333
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:55,849
All I can think about was
the absolute abyss of death.

334
00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:58,478
After death, to me,
there is just nothing.

335
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:03,959
I think it was the scenes where
she had sort of a running in it.

336
00:36:04,061 --> 00:36:05,961
That's what I felt like doing.

337
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:09,191
I felt, if I could just outrun death...

338
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:13,430
if I could just get away from
it, the whole thought of it.

339
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:16,803
And I also remember that if you...

340
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:19,502
wash your face...

341
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:22,272
you can wash away the memories.

342
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,780
But that is pure myth.

343
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:28,784
Because I've washed my
face to all end of time...

344
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:30,854
and death was always there in me.

345
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:21,730
So that was the easiest part...

346
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,501
of any ritual or any dance scene...

347

that Maya might have wanted
for me to totally express...

348
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:31,773

00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:59,792
this was the first time anybody

wrote letters for her in support of her.

And she then used the

very, very special footage in

of course Haiti is quite famous for this...

and that is why she went to Haiti.

Maya used the device

00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:44,630
at the time that she was
filming... a wire recorder.

Quite heavy. Very delicate.

Well, I'll tell you,
my first reaction...

395
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:39,326
was annoyance, you know...

396
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:42,593
because she had had the advantage...

of all my correspondence.

398
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:49,532
Also, she didn't relate
to me as she should have.

399
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,631
I got over that, because...

400
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:54,302
I saw that she was a serious person...

401
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:57,346
and was received by Haitians.

402
00:41:57,448 --> 00:42:00,508
In 1936, when I went
to the West Indies...

403
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:04,076
it was partly as an anthropologist
and partly as a dancer.

404
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:08,750
And for a while I had a very rough
time holding those two things together.

405

My interest in Haiti was not
only dance, but it was the Vodoun.

406
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:24,868
But then I knew what I had to do.

407
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:27,876
I wanted to see what the
foot movements were...

408
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:31,778
and the hip movements and the various things
that would make up what they brought...

00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:35,818
what their ancestors had brought
from Africa to the Caribbean.

410

And this comes across quite well.

00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,414
And then, of course, as I got into it...

412
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:43,857
I had to see what god
behaved in what way...

413

so that one's self is really transcended
and everything is clear in another way...

467
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:51,200
I think one would begin
to... to know what I mean.

468
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:54,072
I think artistic inspiration
is in that direction.

469
00:46:54,178 --> 00:46:56,612
I think love is in that direction.

470
00:46:56,713 --> 00:47:00,171
The logics of love are different
than the logics of non-love.

471
00:47:00,284 --> 00:47:03,378
[Singing, Drumming Continues]

472
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:28,736
[Deren] It's rather
like being overcome...

473
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:33,283
by a transcendent and larger force...

474
00:47:33,383 --> 00:47:36,375
and you don't take to it easily.

475
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:55,627
[Man] The most personal
film I feel Maya ever made...

476
00:48:55,732 --> 00:48:58,530
and people think it's a very
strange attitude to have...

477
00:48:58,635 --> 00:49:00,796
is her Meditation on Violence.

478
00:49:00,904 --> 00:49:03,134
She doesn't appear in the film...

479
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,231
but-but she is the camera.

480
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:09,403
She is moving, she is breathing
in relationship to this dancer.

481
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:12,812
She is composing so
that the one shadow...

482
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:15,612
or the three shadows or
at times the no shadow...

483
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:18,813
of this dancer against the background
are an integral part of the dance.

484
00:49:18,922 --> 00:49:22,085
Every kind of quality of texture...

485
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:25,127
is a really felt part of the frame.

486
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:28,561
And so, I feel, this is very personal.

487
00:49:28,665 --> 00:49:31,600
[Flute]

488
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:57,457
[Deren] Metamorphosis
in the large sense...

489
00:49:57,561 --> 00:50:00,223
meant that there was
no beginning and no end.

490
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:05,393
And indeed I found out from the Chinese
boy who performed the movements here...

491
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:08,164
that this school of boxing, Wu Tang...

492
00:50:08,271 --> 00:50:11,001
is based on The Book of Change...

493
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:14,339
and that its theory is that...

494
00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:18,938
life is an ongoing
process, constantly...

495
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:22,416
and that it is based on
a negative-positive...

496
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:27,252
with constantly a resolution into
another negative and positive and so on.

497
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:30,758
And so my first problem
became to construct a form...

498
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:33,329
as a whole, which
would suggest infinity.

499
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:37,025
Now, the Wu Tang based on the
negative-positive principle...

500
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:40,001
translates that in physical
terms into the breathing.

501
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:42,401
And that's why it's called
an interior boxing...

502
00:50:42,506 --> 00:50:46,442
because the movements are
governed by an interior condition.

503
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:51,606
And so I determined to treat
the movements as a meditation...

504
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:56,414
that one circles around
an idea in time terms.

505
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:21,977
This was the Greenwich
Village of the '40s...

506
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:27,415
and it was the center of
many artistic activity.

507
00:51:27,517 --> 00:51:30,816
I was just a young man,
fresh out of college.

508
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:35,620
I was entering the dance
field as an untrained dancer.

509
00:51:35,725 --> 00:51:41,288
However, my background was in
what is now known as martial arts.

510
00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:43,298
I had studied that at home.

511
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:47,234
And so I was moving around
the party circuits...

512
00:51:47,337 --> 00:51:49,567
among the dancers and the writers.

513
00:51:49,673 --> 00:51:51,800
And my favorite dancer...

514
00:51:51,908 --> 00:51:56,538
a lady by name of Teiko,
introduced me to Maya.

515
00:51:56,646 --> 00:52:00,582
Maya was already working
with body movement.

516
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:04,916
We met, and Maya is
a very intelligent...

517
00:52:05,021 --> 00:52:07,717
or intellectual person...

518
00:52:07,824 --> 00:52:11,692
but she is also a
woman full of passion...

519
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:16,994
and she was a woman with
a lot of internal tension.

520
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,728
And we started with many arguments...

521
00:52:19,836 --> 00:52:21,997
because she had just
come back from Haiti...

522
00:52:22,105 --> 00:52:26,667
and she was all involved
with Haitian Voodoo...

523
00:52:26,776 --> 00:52:29,802
and the trance and the shaman culture.

524
00:52:29,913 --> 00:52:33,314
And I was saying that
in the Chinese context...

525
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:36,647
it was quite the opposite.

526
00:52:36,753 --> 00:52:40,484
It was the wise man is the
one who controls nature...

527
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:43,525
rather than allowing nature to possess.

528
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:50,498
We were all very poor...

529
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:54,400
so, of course, we had no special space.

530
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:59,532
We worked in Maya's small apartment.

531
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:02,612
We pushed all the
furniture to the kitchen...

532
00:53:02,712 --> 00:53:05,647
and we tried to hang paper...

533
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:10,311
photographers' paper
backgrounds along the wall...

534
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:13,287
to give it a clear space.

535
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:19,329
See, when we want to break
out into aggressiveness...

536
00:53:19,429 --> 00:53:23,331
and into an outburst of power...

537
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:27,563
a contained space is
no longer appropriate.

538
00:53:27,671 --> 00:53:30,333
So with one jump, we are high up...

539
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:33,204
and we had the open sky.

540
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:36,905
And then, the power can break out...

541
00:53:37,013 --> 00:53:40,505
and directly confront the camera.

542
00:53:40,617 --> 00:53:44,053
She conceived this entire project...

543
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:48,750
as an emergence from
softness into harshness.

544
00:53:48,858 --> 00:53:53,852
I would simply do exactly the
sequence that I had learned...

545
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:57,798
and Maya would film it, cut it.

546
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:02,463
She reedited it, doubled
it, reversed it...

547
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:07,009
so that it became a
continuous interplay...

548
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:11,513
between her and the raw movement.

549
00:54:37,974 --> 00:54:40,738
[Deren] What I wanted to do here was...

550
00:54:40,844 --> 00:54:43,904
have the climax point of paralysis.

551
00:54:44,014 --> 00:54:46,380
And so that is what happens here.

552
00:54:46,483 --> 00:54:50,214
The movement gets more and
more and more violent...

553
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,982
and the extreme of violence tips over...

554
00:54:53,089 --> 00:54:58,356
and goes into its opposite and becomes
a point of paralysis with silence...

555
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:00,122
right here...

556
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:03,825
from which the film returned
and is photographed in reverse...

557
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:06,231
all the way back.

558
00:55:06,336 --> 00:55:09,567
Now, the extraordinary thing about
this type of movement is that...

559
00:55:09,673 --> 00:55:11,607
it's as much in balance
when you see it backwards...

560
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:14,302
as when you see it forwards.

561
00:55:15,378 --> 00:55:18,836
It took the Chinese to invent
this fight in the fifth century.

562
00:55:34,297 --> 00:55:37,198
[Chao-Li Chi] The term
Tai-Chi literally means...

563
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:39,461
"the ultimate form."

564
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:42,504
And what can be an ultimate form?

565
00:55:42,605 --> 00:55:45,506
It's not the most
perfect or most beautiful.

566
00:55:45,608 --> 00:55:48,042
That would be a Western concept.

567
00:55:48,144 --> 00:55:52,547
In China, the ultimate form
is that which has no form.

568
00:55:52,649 --> 00:55:55,550
This is not supposed to be a paradox...

569
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:59,850
because what has no form is
when a shape is in motion...

570
00:55:59,956 --> 00:56:02,083
is in constant change.

571
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:08,131
So that which is in constant
motion contains all possible forms.

572
00:56:14,738 --> 00:56:16,968
[Deren] Art actually is
based on the notion that...

573
00:56:17,073 --> 00:56:20,600
if you would really celebrate
an idea or a principle...

574
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,644
you must think, you must plan...

575
00:56:22,746 --> 00:56:26,375
you must put yourself completely
in the state of devotion...

576
00:56:26,483 --> 00:56:31,045
and not simply give the first
thing that comes to your head.

577
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:36,383
[Mekas] I did not want to
insult her or provoke her...

578
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:41,658
by taking, you know, my Bolex
to Maya's parties and filming.

579
00:56:41,765 --> 00:56:45,701
She would have gone
into one of her rages.

580
00:56:45,802 --> 00:56:48,999
"What-What is this?" you know. "Where
is your script? This is not serious."

581
00:56:49,105 --> 00:56:53,804
Maya was for a very careful,
"be prepared" kind of filming.

582
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:59,678
She was not for improvisation or
collecting just random footage.

583
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:08,289
Even if she disapproved of what
was happening already in cinema...

584
00:57:08,391 --> 00:57:12,589
still she was by her
activities as a pioneer...

585
00:57:12,695 --> 00:57:16,426
that invaded and attacked
universities and art institutions...

586
00:57:16,533 --> 00:57:19,195
that you have to show avant-garde film.

587
00:57:19,302 --> 00:57:24,365
She was a pioneer, and
she broke the first ice.

588
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:29,837
[Arsham] Every single thing she said...

589
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:34,542
was prearranged in
her notes, in her mind.

590
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:37,950
She used to write things on
little three-by-five index cards...

591
00:57:38,054 --> 00:57:40,921
and carry them with her everywhere.

592
00:57:41,024 --> 00:57:43,925
I mean, she would kill me
if she heard me say this...

593
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:47,224
but it always made me think
of students of the Talmud...

594
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:49,195
where you take one
sentence out of the Bible...

595
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,426
and you can write 50 books...

596
00:57:51,534 --> 00:57:54,298
based on that one sentence.

597
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:57,737
That's exactly what Maya did.

598
00:57:57,841 --> 00:58:01,436
Every word, every possible meaning.

599
00:58:01,544 --> 00:58:04,479
In other words, she didn't
expand what she knew...

600
00:58:04,581 --> 00:58:07,607
but she went down into it.

601
00:58:10,587 --> 00:58:14,489
[Deren] What is important in a motion
picture camera, of course, is its motor.

602
00:58:14,591 --> 00:58:20,029
Just remember that motion
picture is a time form.

603
00:58:20,129 --> 00:58:23,792
Just as the telescope reveals
the structure of matter...

604
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:28,303
in a way that the unaided
eye can never see it...

605
00:58:28,404 --> 00:58:33,307
so slow motion reveals
the structure of motion.

606
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:39,006
Events that occur rapidly so that
they seem a continuous flux...

607
00:58:39,115 --> 00:58:43,381
are revealed in slow motion to be
full of pulsations and agonies...

608
00:58:43,486 --> 00:58:47,013
and indecisions and repetitions.

609
00:59:08,978 --> 00:59:13,278
For all her extreme individualism
and many stories about her...

610
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:15,283
her temperament...

611
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:19,515
and her need to have things her way...

612
00:59:19,622 --> 00:59:22,250
nevertheless, Maya was an artist...

613
00:59:22,358 --> 00:59:26,055
of great collaborative instincts.

614
00:59:26,162 --> 00:59:28,995
She worked... in the
films that she made...

615
00:59:29,098 --> 00:59:33,296
you would read a whole list
of musicians, dancers...

616
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:36,372
choreographers, painters...

617
00:59:36,472 --> 00:59:39,498
who were part of her collaboration...

618
00:59:39,609 --> 00:59:43,340
and who inspired her
and whom she inspired.

619
00:59:43,446 --> 00:59:45,914
And The Living Theatre
was part of that...

620
00:59:46,015 --> 00:59:49,382
these interweaving circles of that time.

621
00:59:49,485 --> 00:59:51,885
And it was a place of encounter...

622
00:59:51,988 --> 00:59:55,856
a place where different spirits...

623
00:59:55,959 --> 00:59:58,427
could set each other on fire.

624
00:59:58,528 --> 01:00:02,464
And Maya was always on fire.
She was a burning person.

625
01:00:02,565 --> 01:00:06,626
She had some intensity that, you
know, that never stopped sizzling.

626
01:00:06,736 --> 01:00:11,002
- She loved at any social
gathering to dance... [Drums]

627
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:15,305
to exhibit the exuberance of her body.

628
01:00:15,411 --> 01:00:20,280
When she danced at a party,
everybody felt it as a special kind...

629
01:00:20,383 --> 01:00:22,715
of religious and sexual act at once...

630
01:00:22,819 --> 01:00:27,916
because Voodoo allows for that kind
of tremendous physical commitment.

631
01:00:28,024 --> 01:00:31,050
She's very close to what
Artaud is asking of us...

632
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:35,460
that we commit our bodies to
the experience in the theater.

[Deren] Their Goddess of Love...

637
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:55,988
is a very fascinating and complex idea.

638
01:03:56,098 --> 01:04:00,364
She is, in fact, the goddess
of all the luxuries...

639
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:03,404
which are not essential to survival.

640
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:07,306
She is the Goddess of
Love which, unlike sex...

641
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:10,402
is not essential to propagation.

642
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:14,244
She is the muse of the arts.

643
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:18,047
Now, man can live without it, but he
doesn't live very much as man without it.

644
01:04:18,154 --> 01:04:22,989
It is strange that one would have to go to an
apparently primitive culture such as Haiti...

645
01:04:23,092 --> 01:04:25,390
to find an understanding...

646
01:04:25,494 --> 01:04:28,691
in such exalted terms...

647
01:04:28,798 --> 01:04:31,198
of what the essential
feminine... not female...

648
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:34,133
feminine role might conceivably be...

649
01:04:34,237 --> 01:04:37,172
that of being everything
which is human...

650
01:04:37,273 --> 01:04:42,108
everything which is more
than that which is necessary.

651
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:44,202
Taken from this point of view...

652
01:04:44,313 --> 01:04:50,183
there is no reason in the world why women
shouldn't be artists, and very fine ones.

653
01:04:50,286 --> 01:04:52,618
I am a little distressed that...

654
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:58,217
so few women have
entered the area of film.

[Deren] Possession is the

660
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:45,011
It is not the freeing of one's identity.

It is not people carrying
on in a kind of wild state...

662
01:09:49,919 --> 01:09:52,217
but it is the presence of the gods...

663
01:09:52,321 --> 01:09:54,915
and, as it were, the materialization...

We'd have these little sort of

"That Maya, how is she able...

to get such a young guy as her lover?"

670

It was very shocking that there
were 18 years between them.

If there was a party or

she was the center of attention.

674
01:12:52,035 --> 01:12:55,562
She was quite short, and you
wouldn't quite realize this...

675
01:12:55,672 --> 01:12:58,607
if she was speaking from
a podium or dancing...

676
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:01,006
because she seemed larger than she was.

[Ferguson] After Teiji
came to live with Maya...

685
01:13:33,610 --> 01:13:36,340
she took him to Haiti.

686
01:13:36,446 --> 01:13:39,210
And he heard the drumming and the
various rhyhms and learned them.

687
01:13:39,315 --> 01:13:41,408
Then when they came back to New York...

688
01:13:41,517 --> 01:13:45,112
they had the idea that they would get
some of his friends who were drummers...

689
01:13:45,221 --> 01:13:47,917
and set up a program.

690
01:13:48,024 --> 01:13:52,017
And they took it around to
various community centers...

691
01:13:52,128 --> 01:13:55,620
and would do a demonstration
of Haitian drumming.

692
01:13:55,732 --> 01:13:58,997
One evening when they were
practicing or rehearsing for that...

693
01:13:59,102 --> 01:14:01,036
I got a few rolls of
film and some tape...

694
01:14:01,137 --> 01:14:03,435
and did a few shots.

695
01:14:03,539 --> 01:14:06,736
And there was endless
coffee being served.

696
01:14:06,843 --> 01:14:09,471

Medaglia D'Oro coffee.

(Singing) I've consulted

701
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:30,695

me what, when or where about you.

with them as their friend, with her and Teiji.

706
01:14:53,156 --> 01:14:57,354
They took me in like a
bird with a broken wing...

707
01:14:57,460 --> 01:15:01,191
which was not far from what I was,
and sheltered me for several months.

So if this film comes out okay...

709
01:15:06,669 --> 01:15:11,265
as I hope it will, I will
call it Water for Maya.

710
01:15:11,374 --> 01:15:14,866
This is music for the eyes for Maya...

711
01:15:14,977 --> 01:15:16,877
but it's ritual also.

712
01:15:16,979 --> 01:15:20,176
I will have to take it
through to where it is...

713
01:15:20,283 --> 01:15:23,081
that deep sense of water
that's transformative...

714
01:15:23,186 --> 01:15:27,145
that's mysterious, that's
even down to the river Styx.

[Drums, Chanting]

716
01:15:33,863 --> 01:15:37,822
Larry Jordon and I were invited to
go to Geoffrey Holder's wedding...

717
01:15:37,934 --> 01:15:42,667
when he was in the Flower
Drum Song by John Latouche...

718
01:15:42,772 --> 01:15:44,672
a big Broadway hit of the time.

719
01:15:44,774 --> 01:15:46,935
And they had a big wedding
out on Long Island...

720
01:15:47,043 --> 01:15:50,843
and the P.R. people wanted to make
a lot of advertisement out of it.

721
01:15:50,947 --> 01:15:54,178
And Holder had invited
her as a priestess...

722
01:15:54,283 --> 01:15:56,877
to come and make it a Haitian wedding.

723
01:15:56,986 --> 01:16:00,387
By the time we arrived, they
had shambled her aside...

724
01:16:00,490 --> 01:16:03,220
and given her a small room
and were not allowing her...

725
01:16:03,326 --> 01:16:08,559
to put up the Vodoun ritual
things, and she went into a rage.

726
01:16:08,664 --> 01:16:11,224
This is what would be
called a holy rage...

727
01:16:11,334 --> 01:16:15,668
and it did have the effect of something
that a lot of people don't believe I saw...

728
01:16:15,772 --> 01:16:17,672
but I saw it with my own eyes.

729
01:16:17,774 --> 01:16:20,607
She went into the kitchen...

730
01:16:20,710 --> 01:16:22,610
and she took a refrigerator...

731
01:16:22,712 --> 01:16:26,546
and she hurled it from one corner
of that kitchen to the other.

732
01:16:26,649 --> 01:16:30,608
Now, you know, I've tried to say,
well, how could such a small woman...

733
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:33,280
Maya of all people,
lift up a refrigerator?

734
01:16:33,389 --> 01:16:36,950
Well, these are people that forget
mothers have lifted up automobiles...

735
01:16:37,059 --> 01:16:39,619
to get them off of their children.

736
01:16:39,729 --> 01:16:44,826
Maya was in a trance of Papa
Loco, the god of ritual...

737
01:16:44,934 --> 01:16:48,927
which was being blasphemed
against at this wedding.

738
01:16:49,038 --> 01:16:50,938
And she had the strength of 10.

739
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:53,770
I mean, maybe she pivoted it
on one side, I don't know how.

740
01:16:53,876 --> 01:16:55,707
But what I saw is I saw... [Growls]

741
01:16:55,812 --> 01:17:01,079
She's making such growl noises
that were shaking everybody's teeth.

742
01:17:01,184 --> 01:17:04,813
She slammed this refrigerator
up against the other wall...

743
01:17:04,921 --> 01:17:06,821
and broke a lot of dishes.

744
01:17:06,923 --> 01:17:08,857
Everyone went running,
screaming from this kitchen.

745
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:13,452
Then she was led upstairs as she
went on with these growl noises.

746
01:17:13,563 --> 01:17:16,293
I was then invited up to this room...

747
01:17:16,399 --> 01:17:20,495
and I was quite terrified...
to receive a blessing...

748
01:17:20,603 --> 01:17:23,902
for the pictures that I was taking.

749
01:17:24,006 --> 01:17:28,375
Burning rum was put all over me, and
I didn't know what was happening even.

750
01:17:28,478 --> 01:17:32,972
I thought, this is my only suit, and I was
trying to brush out these blue flames, you know.

751
01:17:33,082 --> 01:17:36,848
Meanwhile, a lot of
languages going on here.

752
01:17:36,953 --> 01:17:39,820
And then I was told later, "You
got a blessing from Papa Loco"...

753
01:17:39,922 --> 01:17:42,049
and I do well believe it.

754
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:44,183
And one reason I believe
it, however, is because...

755
01:17:44,293 --> 01:17:47,228
once I arrived two hours
late to help Maya Deren...

756
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:51,562
fold and mail envelopes for
an event that she cared about.

757
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:56,297
She put a curse on
me, and I did get sick.

758
01:17:56,405 --> 01:18:01,172
And I had reason from another man
that had gone to Haiti that I knew...

759
01:18:01,277 --> 01:18:04,610
Angelo De Benedetto told me,
"The only reason you didn't die...

760
01:18:04,714 --> 01:18:08,946
is because you have a very
powerful blessing of Papa Loco."

761
01:18:09,051 --> 01:18:11,110
So that's the two sides of Maya...

762
01:18:11,220 --> 01:18:15,452
and I benefited from and
suffered from both of them.

763
01:18:15,558 --> 01:18:18,425
And people that, you know,
wanna either make her...

764
01:18:18,528 --> 01:18:20,587
one thing or another thing
or any definitive thing...

765
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:25,224
are not comprehending one, the
beautiful complexity of this woman...

766
01:18:25,334 --> 01:18:28,235
and two, they are not
understanding artists at all.

767
01:18:28,337 --> 01:18:30,430
She had to be all these many things...

768
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:33,134
to be the creative
person that she was...

769
01:18:33,242 --> 01:18:36,678
to do things in cinema that
had never been done before.

770
01:18:36,779 --> 01:18:39,339
In fact, you could say leaving
the word "cinema" out of it...

771
01:18:39,448 --> 01:18:43,475
to effect rituals and moving visual...

772
01:18:43,586 --> 01:18:47,647
moving vision that had
never been done before.

773
01:18:47,757 --> 01:18:52,524
And-And it took all
these powers, you know.

774
01:18:52,628 --> 01:18:56,530
And alas, at some point
finally, you know...

775
01:18:56,632 --> 01:18:59,692
when an artist has powers
like this, he or she...

776
01:18:59,802 --> 01:19:04,296
If those powers get outside of
the work process, it can kill you.

777
01:19:04,407 --> 01:19:07,570
And I fervently believe that
that's what killed Maya Deren...

778
01:19:07,677 --> 01:19:09,804
at, you say, 44 years old.

779
01:19:09,912 --> 01:19:13,404
I mean, she died young
anyway, whatever age she was...

780
01:19:13,516 --> 01:19:15,677
and it was because somehow...

781
01:19:15,785 --> 01:19:19,949
the powers of Vodoun got
outside the work process...

782
01:19:20,056 --> 01:19:24,288
partly because she didn't get
the money to finish her last...

783
01:19:24,393 --> 01:19:26,759
you know, The Very Eye of Night.

784
01:19:26,862 --> 01:19:29,922
And even when it was finished,
nobody understood it, you know...

785
01:19:30,032 --> 01:19:32,262
but me and a very few others.

786
01:19:32,368 --> 01:19:34,859
The Very Eye of Night has it all.

787
01:19:34,971 --> 01:19:37,963
It's intrinsically Greek. It goes
straight up through Shakespeare.

788
01:19:38,074 --> 01:19:41,009
It is the ritual of her culture.

789
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:45,103
And everyone said, "Oh, Maya
didn't do it. It's over the hill."

790
01:19:45,214 --> 01:19:49,412
And they think her early
psycho-dramas are more important.

791
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:52,282
Well, this is enough to drive
someone crazy and kill them.

792
01:19:52,388 --> 01:19:55,983
They say, "Oh, you can see that
the stars are just sequins...

793
01:19:56,092 --> 01:20:01,325
on a scrim of some kind that
are being shakily moved along."

794
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:05,924
I've heard people say things like, "It's
like a child's little theater thing."

795
01:20:06,035 --> 01:20:08,265
That is exactly the point...

796
01:20:08,371 --> 01:20:11,932
that Maya would not make
a fakery like Hollywood.

797
01:20:12,041 --> 01:20:17,035
She wants it to be
like a-a child's vision.

798
01:20:17,146 --> 01:20:19,046
The somnambulist.

799
01:20:19,148 --> 01:20:22,345
This is a major theme in
the history of cinema...

800
01:20:22,451 --> 01:20:24,783
and Maya would have been
vibrantly aware of that.

801
01:20:24,887 --> 01:20:29,415
It is in very early Méliès films,
and again and again the dreamer...

802
01:20:29,525 --> 01:20:32,858
the walking dreamer is almost...

803
01:20:32,962 --> 01:20:34,930
is almost what stars are...

804
01:20:35,031 --> 01:20:39,127
because the audience is almost
dreaming these dreams together.

805
01:23:12,755 --> 01:23:18,125
The Very Eye of Night was
Maya's last completed film...

806
01:23:18,227 --> 01:23:21,355
and a very traumatic experience for her.

807
01:23:40,482 --> 01:23:45,977
She scraped together some money,
rented a studio, had a dolly, luxuries.

808
01:23:46,088 --> 01:23:48,386
She collaborated on that film...

809
01:23:48,490 --> 01:23:52,256
with one of the world's great,
great choreographers, Antony Tudor...

810
01:23:52,361 --> 01:23:55,626
who was fascinated by her dance films.

811
01:23:55,731 --> 01:24:00,327
And he brought in a young troop
of ballet dancers for the film.

812
01:24:00,436 --> 01:24:02,996
And it was a great deal
of fun on the set...

813
01:24:03,105 --> 01:24:06,370
because people sort
of wandered in and out.

814
01:24:06,475 --> 01:24:09,000
There was a young fellow
named Harrison Star...

815
01:24:09,111 --> 01:24:12,478
the son of a California
friend who shot a great deal.

816
01:24:12,581 --> 01:24:16,381
In other words, there were times
when there were two cameras on this.

817
01:24:16,485 --> 01:24:20,353
Lots of people were crawling all over
the place, wiring, whatever was necessary.

818
01:24:20,456 --> 01:24:25,393
I remember John Cage and a bunch
of painters coming onto the set.

819
01:24:32,034 --> 01:24:35,333
[Deren] And for some reason,
the image came into my mind...

820
01:24:35,437 --> 01:24:38,270
of a film that I had seen at
the Museum of Natural History...

821
01:24:38,374 --> 01:24:41,434
which dealt with the
movement of celestial bodies.

822
01:24:41,543 --> 01:24:45,104
And it was a scientific film.
It was an astrological film.

823
01:24:45,214 --> 01:24:47,114
It had no pretensions.

824
01:24:47,216 --> 01:24:51,414
But here was the moon, here was the
stars and here was Jupiter and so on...

825
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:55,718
and all of these things in this
great black space were revolving.

826
01:24:55,824 --> 01:25:01,524
It was really the most beautiful abstract
ballet that I have ever seen in all my life...

827
01:25:01,630 --> 01:25:05,726
and it was beautiful because the
bodies were really related by gravity.

828
01:25:05,834 --> 01:25:09,326
They were not falsely
related by artistic decisions.

829
01:25:09,438 --> 01:25:11,963
The moon came closer or farther...

830
01:25:12,074 --> 01:25:15,601
for real reasons, not
for made-up reasons.

831
01:25:15,711 --> 01:25:19,477
And therefore, the balance of the
frame, you see what I mean, was perfect.

832
01:25:19,581 --> 01:25:24,245
The balance of the relationship of all
these bodies was at all times perfect.

833
01:26:35,457 --> 01:26:38,290
I often saw Maya very
vulnerable. She would go...

834
01:26:38,394 --> 01:26:41,921
She would sit down and cry, which most
people don't have a sense of her doing.

835
01:26:42,031 --> 01:26:46,092
She-She also... She'd
gird herself for a party.

836
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:49,568
One of her ways is she would,
like, hitch up her dress...

837
01:26:49,671 --> 01:26:52,037
give herself a shot...

838
01:26:52,141 --> 01:26:56,373
of Dr. Jacob's feel-good hypo...

839
01:26:56,478 --> 01:26:59,038
you know, in her rear
end, to give her...

840
01:26:59,148 --> 01:27:02,208
And she thought she was taking vitamins.

841
01:27:02,317 --> 01:27:05,218
I guess there were vitamins in there,
but it was mostly speed as we now know it.

842
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:10,053
This is someone who is forcing
herself into the human arena...

843
01:27:10,159 --> 01:27:13,128
from a sense of extreme vulnerability.

844
01:27:46,161 --> 01:27:48,823
She was not only making her own films...

845
01:27:48,931 --> 01:27:51,832
but she was very concerned
about the other filmmakers...

846
01:27:51,934 --> 01:27:53,834
and how to get them better known...

847
01:27:53,936 --> 01:27:56,029
and finally came up with the idea...

848
01:27:56,138 --> 01:27:58,402
of Creative Film Foundation...

849
01:27:58,507 --> 01:28:00,998
to provide them with recognition...

850
01:28:01,110 --> 01:28:04,238
publicity, public acceptance...

851
01:28:04,346 --> 01:28:06,280
and money.

852
01:28:06,381 --> 01:28:11,876
So she started to create a board of
directors of very well-known people...

853
01:28:11,987 --> 01:28:15,787
and the idea was, you know, to
provide a showcase really for films...

854
01:28:15,891 --> 01:28:17,984
that were not Hollywood films...

855
01:28:18,093 --> 01:28:20,960
but film as art.

856
01:28:39,615 --> 01:28:41,742
[Deren] I would like
to recall to everyone...

857
01:28:41,850 --> 01:28:45,684
that the motion picture camera and
the whole motion picture medium...

858
01:28:45,787 --> 01:28:50,417
was developed at about the same
period and in the same climate...

859
01:28:50,526 --> 01:28:56,362
as the development of the
telegraph and the airplane...

860
01:28:56,465 --> 01:28:59,901
and all of these other
industrial expressions...

861
01:29:00,002 --> 01:29:02,835
of something that was
happening in the mind of man...

862
01:29:02,938 --> 01:29:08,308
which wanted to break some kind
of confines that reflects in film.

863
01:29:08,410 --> 01:29:10,378
This is its fascination for me.

864
01:29:10,479 --> 01:29:14,210
It would be so much easier
to be a painter or a writer.

865
01:29:14,316 --> 01:29:17,615
You don't have to have equipment.
You don't have to do all the things.

866
01:29:17,719 --> 01:29:20,847
You're not at the mercy of the laboratories.
You're not here and you're not there.

867
01:29:20,956 --> 01:29:24,722
It's a terrible pain
to be a filmmaker...

868
01:29:24,826 --> 01:29:27,351
because you not only have
the creative problems...

869
01:29:27,462 --> 01:29:30,693
but you have financial
problems that they don't have.

870
01:29:30,799 --> 01:29:33,097
You have technical problems
that they don't have.

871
01:29:33,202 --> 01:29:37,798
You have machines that are breaking down in
a way that paint brushes don't break down.

872
01:29:37,906 --> 01:29:40,704
It's just a terrible
thing to be a filmmaker.

873
01:29:40,809 --> 01:29:45,906
And if you are a filmmaker, it's because
there is something in the sheer medium...

874
01:29:46,014 --> 01:29:50,417
that seems to be able to
make some sort of statement...

875
01:29:50,519 --> 01:29:52,419
that you particularly want to make...

876
01:29:52,521 --> 01:29:57,458
and which no other medium to you seems
capable of making in the same way.

877
01:30:07,436 --> 01:30:10,405
The actual award that was
presented to the filmmaker...

878
01:30:10,505 --> 01:30:12,564
was a very nice document.

879
01:30:12,674 --> 01:30:16,542
But, of course, it was supposed
to be accompanied also by money.

880
01:30:16,645 --> 01:30:20,877
And this was one of the unhappinesses...

881
01:30:20,983 --> 01:30:23,213
I would say, in Maya's life.

882
01:30:23,318 --> 01:30:26,685
Namely, she was unable to
get money for this award.

883
01:30:38,533 --> 01:30:42,731
[Ito] Uh, I'd like to
introduce Maya Deren...

884
01:30:42,838 --> 01:30:45,864
to invoke the particular gods.

885
01:30:45,974 --> 01:30:50,377
[Deren] I don't have a trained voice,
but that makes it very authentic.

886
01:30:50,479 --> 01:30:53,039
[Laughter]

887
01:30:55,417 --> 01:30:59,751
[Deren Singing In Foreign Language]

888
01:31:52,874 --> 01:31:56,173
[Destiné] The Day of the Dead,
and that's the day of Ghede.

889
01:31:56,278 --> 01:31:58,439
So Ghede is a humorous guy.

890
01:31:58,547 --> 01:32:02,711
When somebody is possessed by
Ghede, Ghede is poking fun at death.

891
01:32:02,818 --> 01:32:06,982
To Ghede, people should
not cry when we die.

892
01:32:07,089 --> 01:32:11,253
They should celebrate instead,
because he believes in reincarnation.

893
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:14,261
Anybody who would be possessed
or connected with Ghede...

894
01:32:14,363 --> 01:32:16,263
would be acting very strangely.

895
01:32:16,365 --> 01:32:20,165
Very, you know, out of the ordinary.

896
01:32:20,268 --> 01:32:22,566
So this was Maya.

897
01:32:22,671 --> 01:32:26,402
And she attached herself to her cat...

898
01:32:26,508 --> 01:32:28,408
and she called the cat Ghede...

899
01:32:28,510 --> 01:32:33,914
That made it more bizarre
to have a cat called...

900
01:32:34,015 --> 01:32:37,143
Because nobody would dare do
that in Haiti... call a cat Ghede.

901
01:32:37,252 --> 01:32:39,152
It would be an insult to the spirits.

902
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:54,469
[Vogel] It was after one of...

903
01:32:54,569 --> 01:33:00,337
the Creative Film Foundation award
evenings that we got together.

904
01:33:00,442 --> 01:33:03,775
Maya stayed after most people left.

905
01:33:03,879 --> 01:33:07,781
We kind of, like, sat
around and played some music.

906
01:33:07,883 --> 01:33:12,445
And she got up and danced
and sang a little Russian...

907
01:33:12,554 --> 01:33:17,287
and got a little teary and felt...

908
01:33:17,392 --> 01:33:22,955
I guess she was feeling nostalgic
about her life and her past...

909
01:33:23,064 --> 01:33:27,000
and where she came
from, and talked about...

910
01:33:27,102 --> 01:33:30,094
She thinks she'd like to
go back home to Russia...

911
01:33:30,205 --> 01:33:33,936
where she spent her childhood,
I think, till she was five.

912
01:33:34,042 --> 01:33:38,376
Maybe she felt like going home...

913
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:42,974
because she was getting older
and life was getting harder.

914
01:33:43,084 --> 01:33:46,611
And as I think about it subsequently...

915
01:33:46,721 --> 01:33:50,213
I also think that Maya
would not have enjoyed...

916
01:33:50,325 --> 01:33:53,294
the aging process too well.

917
01:33:56,398 --> 01:34:00,129
[Ferguson] One evening... it
was in October '61, I think...

918
01:34:00,235 --> 01:34:05,263
I had a call from Teiji, and I hadn't
seen him or Maya for a few weeks.

919
01:34:05,373 --> 01:34:10,003
And I was horrified
because Teiji said...

920
01:34:10,111 --> 01:34:13,706
Maya was sick in a hospital...

921
01:34:13,815 --> 01:34:16,249
and wasn't expected to live the night.

922
01:34:16,351 --> 01:34:20,447
And I had no idea what was happening.

923
01:34:20,555 --> 01:34:23,080
He asked me to come to the hospital.

924
01:34:23,191 --> 01:34:28,094
Teiji was there with Maya's
mother, and that was all.

925
01:34:28,196 --> 01:34:31,495
And I think the reason was he
had never really believed...

926
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:34,660
that she was that sick, and
he had never told anybody...

927
01:34:34,769 --> 01:34:37,602
that she was in this condition.

928
01:34:37,706 --> 01:34:40,607
And when I arrived, sure
enough he repeated...

929
01:34:40,709 --> 01:34:43,234
that the doctor had said
she wouldn't live the night.

930
01:34:43,345 --> 01:34:46,314
He hoped, in a forlorn way...

931
01:34:46,414 --> 01:34:50,817
that because it was going to be Friday
the l3th of October at midnight...

932
01:34:50,919 --> 01:34:55,049
he hoped that that would change their
luck and that she would come out after all.

933
01:34:55,156 --> 01:35:00,116
And in the course of the night around
2:00 or 3:00 in the morning, she did die.

934
01:35:00,228 --> 01:35:03,686
And I never talked to
her. She was in a coma.

935
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:23,980
I think she probably was
rundown from lack of food.

936
01:35:24,085 --> 01:35:27,452
She and Teiji had been
poor for a very long time.

937
01:35:27,556 --> 01:35:32,823
His being in the army had been
a real blow for them financially.

938
01:35:32,928 --> 01:35:34,987
And I think... I know
that there were days...

939
01:35:35,096 --> 01:35:37,894
when they could not
eat, and sometimes...

940
01:35:37,999 --> 01:35:41,799
if there was a little money
it went to feed the cats.

941
01:35:41,903 --> 01:35:46,067
So I think that she was
rundown, and I think that...

942
01:35:46,174 --> 01:35:51,441
she was getting Max Jacobson's
cocktails, as she called them...

943
01:35:51,546 --> 01:35:53,605
the shots to keep her going.

944
01:35:53,715 --> 01:35:58,448
It could be there was a side
effect from that combination.

945
01:35:58,553 --> 01:36:01,681
Teiji felt that she had died of anger...

946
01:36:01,790 --> 01:36:05,282
at the court problems...

947
01:36:05,393 --> 01:36:08,294
over his-his inheritance.

948
01:36:08,396 --> 01:36:11,797
And there is some possibility...
Maya was a person...

949
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:15,336
of limitless emotional power...

950
01:36:15,437 --> 01:36:20,397
and she was always full of
joy or anger or distress.

951
01:36:20,508 --> 01:36:25,275
Things were very far out
emotionally for her all the time.

952
01:36:25,380 --> 01:36:28,577
And I think if she was angry...

953
01:36:28,683 --> 01:36:33,086
at the events of the court that
day... she was probably very angry...

954
01:36:33,188 --> 01:36:36,919
and a cerebral hemorrhage
may have been the result.

955
01:36:37,025 --> 01:36:39,789
I don't credit the Voodoo theory.

956
01:36:56,211 --> 01:36:58,145
[Ito] And I got it confused.

957
01:36:58,246 --> 01:37:01,443
I thought that she had
wanted it for her funeral...

958
01:37:01,549 --> 01:37:03,449
Haydn's trumpet rondo.

959
01:37:03,551 --> 01:37:05,678
And then, after it was all over...

960
01:37:05,787 --> 01:37:07,948
I remembered that she
wanted it for her wedding.

961
01:37:08,056 --> 01:37:10,650
[Imitating Trumpet]

962
01:37:31,246 --> 01:37:35,910
I took her ashes. She is buried
in the side of Fuji Mountain...

963
01:37:36,017 --> 01:37:41,649
in the most busiest section
of Tokyo Harbor and the ocean.
