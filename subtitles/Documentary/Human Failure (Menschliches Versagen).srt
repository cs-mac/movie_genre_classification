1
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:49,415
I just feel really close to you.

2
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,183
You are really close to me.

3
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:57,913
Well, this way we can share everything.

4
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:05,154
Wow, that's so good.

5
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:08,961
Look.

6
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:11,729
They're still so in love.

7
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:18,236
How great is that?

8
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:24,378
So, where do you see us going?

9
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,250
Well, tonight I see us
going back to my place.

10
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:45,905
Wow!

11
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:48,006
-This is your house?
-Yeah.

12
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,465
It's beautiful!

13
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:50,873
Thank you.

14
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:53,002
I like to come home to a nice place.

15
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:02,014
I'm happy. Are you happy?

16
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:06,090
Oh, yeah. Happy is what I'm all about.

17
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,596
Tripp, as long as you're up, Son...

18
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,329
Come on, Pop! Whoa, man.
Don't you knock?

19
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:16,402
What?

20
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:19,199
Your momma's...
She's snoring like a rhino.

21
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,705
And then this music got started...

22
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:25,306
Hey, you must be Melody.

23
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:27,036
Melissa.

24
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,944
Oh! It's Melissa!

25
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:33,616
It's Melissa. Okay. All right.

26
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,017
Y'all have a good time.

27
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:36,611
Night, Pop.

28
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:42,784
You live with your parents?

29
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:44,523
Is that a problem?

30
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:46,490
Are you kidding me?

31
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:48,261
And she's leaving.

32
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:49,630
Stomping down the steps.

33
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:51,601
Unbelievable! Parents?

34
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:52,864
Putting on her coat.

35
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:54,906
Did you move that umbrella stand?

36
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,737
Oh, shit!

37
00:02:57,277 --> 00:03:01,043
We gotta get rid of that thing.
You know we're gonna get sued?

38
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:02,205
Damn it!

39
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,216
And she's out.

40
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,643
Another one bites the dust.

41
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:09,722
And he is still here.

42
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:05,343
-Morning, Mom.
-Morning.

43
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:06,536
What do you say, Pop?

44
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:07,738
Good morning, Son.

45
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:09,542
Get any sleep last night?

46
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:30,166
-Okay, honey, here you go.
-You're the best, Mom.

47
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,313
Are you kidding me?

48
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,614
-Have a good day.
-You, too.

49
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:51,155
-Don't forget your snack.
-Thanks.

50
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:54,156
-Think fast!
-Bye!

51
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:20,509
So you dumped Melissa?

52
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,350
Well, technically, she dumped me.

53
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:26,124
What happened?

54
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:29,160
It was last night.
We were in a restaurant.

55
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:32,454
She sees this elderly couple
and they're holding hands,

56
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:36,057
and then she decides to hold my hand.

57
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:39,402
So she smiles at me.

58
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:43,735
Next thing I know,
she gives me "the look."

59
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,545
Dude, I'm so sorry.

60
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:48,238
No harm, no foul, though.

61
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:50,472
It was just time for her
to meet the parents.

62
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,682
Not the parents.

63
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:54,275
Bye-bye, Melissa.

64
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:55,748
Here we go again.

65
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,322
Yeah. What's your point?

66
00:05:57,423 --> 00:06:00,051
The point is, my friend,

67
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:02,223
you are afraid of love.

68
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:06,688
Bullshit. No, no, no, no, no, man,
I'm not afraid of love.

69
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:10,866
I love love.
Look, I've had a lot of girlfriends, right?

70
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,961
And sometimes I'm the rebound guy.

71
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:14,471
Other times, when I get lucky,

72
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:17,941
I'm the "explore new areas
of your sexuality" guy.

73
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,444
But every single time, we have fun.

74
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:22,275
Thank you.

75
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,112
I have fun, they have fun.
It's good for me, it's good for them.

76
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:28,051
And I would argue that's it's damn good
for civilization as a whole.

77
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:29,644
If more people thought that way...

78
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:30,848
I do sleep well at night.

79
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:34,825
On a twin bed, with Superman sheets
that you've had since you were six.

80
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:36,861
As opposed to you,
who sleeps in a king-sized bed

81
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:38,021
in your mother's basement?

82
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:39,655
It's orthopedic, and I need it.

83
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:41,256
And at least I'm not sponging
off my parents

84
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:43,267
so I can afford to get laid
on every continent.

85
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:47,704
I'm a rambling man. I'm a tumbleweed.
I'm a seeker of truth.

86
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,935
And one truth I've learned,
a child is a parent's greatest joy.

87
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:53,936
Which is why I can't leave
my parents' place,

88
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:55,308
because they would miss me!

89
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,507
Amen, brother!

90
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:59,016
And yet, in America,
we're shunned for our lifestyle.

91
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:01,985
When we should be celebrating
our lifestyle.

92
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:04,788
-We are men who still live at home.
-Yes!

93
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,052
We're not here to apologize
about who we are, or how we do it,

94
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,491
-or who we live with.
-No!

95
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:11,859
I'm looking around this table, <i>hombres,</i>
and I see three winners.

96
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:14,262
And to every one of those out there
who sees something different,

97
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:15,800
I say bring it on!

98
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:17,392
'Cause it's going to take
a stick of dynamite

99
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,266
to get me out of my parents' house.

100
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,101
The boy's 35 years old!

101
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,300
It's just not fair.

102
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:25,468
Thirty-five years!

103
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:28,775
We were good parents,
and now we're supposed to be done!

104
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:31,281
Hey, I don't blame my kid for staying.

105
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:33,614
Our place is much nicer
than anything he can afford.

106
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:35,311
Well, our son's a flight attendant.

107
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:36,888
He travels so much
it doesn't make any sense

108
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:38,251
-to have his own apartment.
-Yeah.

109
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:41,155
Plus he has a lot of pilot friends
who let him stay over.

110
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:46,128
Well, I say the whole thing comes down
to being afraid to spank.

111
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:49,030
I mean you can't build a house
without a hammer!

112
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,626
Anyone for a guava smasher?

113
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:55,871
I learned to make them in Maui.
These really chase your troubles away.

114
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:56,964
Cheers, sweetie.

115
00:07:57,076 --> 00:08:00,876
And who is my hot little <i>wahine,</i> huh?

116
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:05,446
Bev? What is that?

117
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:10,414
Oh, I got this in Hawaii.
This is Lono, the god of fertility.

118
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:14,423
Bud has one, too.
Do you want to see it?

119
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,188
-No!
-No!

120
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:20,362
No. I mean, what's going on here?

121
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,101
-Dougie moved out!
-Dougie moved out!

122
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:24,464
-What?
-You're kidding.

123
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,935
-Yes!
-When?

124
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:27,733
What, like two months ago!

125
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,569
It's been amazing!

126
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,302
Hey, how many times a week
do you think we do it?

127
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,434
-Oh!
-Oh, Bud.

128
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:36,112
What? Oh!

129
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,310
I can't believe it. How'd you do it?
Dougie's a sweet kid, but...

130
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:42,319
How in the world did you get him
to move out?

131
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,379
He met a girl.

132
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:47,721
Met a girl?
Tripp meets a new girl every week.

133
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:51,957
Well, let's just say maybe he hasn't met
the right girl.

134
00:08:56,536 --> 00:09:00,028
Al, I don't want another recliner.
I want something new.

135
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:02,607
Hey, here's something new!

136
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:04,507
Cup holders.

137
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,010
That's not what I'm talking about.

138
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:08,577
-Okay.
-That's nice.

139
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:09,875
Get what you want.

140
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:13,145
Just know that I'm going to be having
an affair within the next six months.

141
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:16,244
If I've gotta recline,
I'm making it interesting.

142
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:17,322
Deal.

143
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:18,515
Hey, gang.

144
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:21,354
Let's stay on point here, huh?
We're picking out chairs.

145
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:24,452
Hello, Dolly!

146
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,156
Son, you see her?

147
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,599
Pop? Pick a chair.

148
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:30,828
This is the one I want.

149
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:32,632
-Sold.
-No, that's polka dot.

150
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,103
We're not gonna put that in the house.

151
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:35,195
Pop, relax.

152
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:37,275
She's taking the chair with her
when she leaves you.

153
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:40,407
We ain't buying that chair.

154
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,743
I am getting this polka-dot chair.
I've got my own money.

155
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:45,442
Unless you start dancing again,
you're broke.

156
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:49,553
Excuse me.

157
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:51,054
-That's mine.
-Yes, ma'am.

158
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:53,381
You're buying that?

159
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:54,481
No.

160
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:00,290
Want a cocktail, blanket or anything?

161
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,424
No, I just need my 20 minutes.

162
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,469
-For what?
-To clear my head.

163
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,404
I come here to relax.

164
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:12,568
You know what helps me?
Put on the Food Network.

165
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:14,675
Takes the edge right off.

166
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,611
Gotta find what works for you.

167
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:21,816
Okay, look, the salesmen don't mind
because I bring them coffee,

168
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:23,786
and the music selection
is a soothing blend

169
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:26,255
of mid-'70s singer-songwriters
and smooth jazz.

170
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,293
It's practically narcotic.

171
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,362
And, usually, people leave me alone.

172
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,896
Sure they do.

173
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,631
There's what you're talking about.

174
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:36,895
It's nice, huh?

175
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:40,336
Yeah! I make fun of my parents,
but these babies are sweet.

176
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:42,435
-I'm Paula.
-I'm Tripp.

177
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:45,066
You know, usually I don't sleep
with someone on the first date.

178
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,304
I don't think this counts as a first date.

179
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:51,483
It would be a date if you asked me
to have a drink tonight.

180
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:54,151
Wanna have a drink tonight?

181
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,515
Can't. How about lunch tomorrow?

182
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:59,250
Sure. Wait. Tomorrow's Saturday.

183
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:02,018
Sometimes I eat on Saturdays.

184
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:04,221
No, I'm doing something
with my nephew.

185
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,422
How about Monday?

186
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:09,932
I'll meet you here.

187
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:11,833
Beautiful.

188
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,775
Hey, hey!

189
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:27,216
Hey, Paula.

190
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,186
Good news, it's Champagne Thursday.

191
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,615
It's Friday.

192
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:34,158
Yeah, Thursday came twice this week.

193
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,925
For the third straight week.

194
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,020
There's talk of making it permanent.

195
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:40,792
Kind of like daylight-savings time?

196
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,959
Right. But for booze.

197
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:45,701
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

198
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:48,768
Shut up, you whore.

199
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:52,339
I'm sorry.
Was I sipping too loudly for you?

200
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:53,605
No, you're not sipping too loud.

201
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,341
It's that goddamn bird
outside my goddamn window.

202
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:59,646
What the hell kind of devil bird
chirps at night?

203
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,587
I think it sounds kind of pretty.

204
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:07,925
You met a guy today.

205
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:09,517
As a matter of fact, I did.

206
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:10,925
He's cute, too.

207
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,759
I met a guy today, too.

208
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:14,025
Really?

209
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,527
He's a radiologist.

210
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:18,296
Well, that's a step up.

211
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,373
He offered to give me a full-body scan
next week, free of charge.

212
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:22,634
Those don't come cheap, you know.

213
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,233
I know. I'm pretty excited about it.

214
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:30,209
How cute?

215
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:33,376
Cute.

216
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:36,150
Well, Tripp's a really nice guy.

217
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,349
He's smart, he's sweet, he's funny.

218
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:42,586
We had a wonderful first meeting.
I see incredible potential here.

219
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,219
So all systems are go?

220
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,355
Based on the initial
personality assessment,

221
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:48,933
I think that I can have your son
moved out of this house

222
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:51,832
and living on his own by June 15th.

223
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,103
Hallelujah!

224
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:56,834
Well, you know, you'd be amazed
at how many adult children

225
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,102
are still living at home.

226
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,907
Now, it's my opinion that the root cause
is a lack of self-esteem.

227
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:04,175
Oh, Oprah talks about that all the time.

228
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,580
Oprah don't know crap!

229
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:07,948
Heck, when I was growing up,
nobody had self-esteem,

230
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:09,145
and we turned out fine.

231
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,689
You're a rock, Al.
You make me a better woman.

232
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,750
Look, many young men who should
be able to move out, simply can't.

233
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:18,989
It's called "failure to launch."
And that's where I come in.

234
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:22,226
Young men develop self-esteem best
during a romantic relationship,

235
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:24,097
so I simulate one.

236
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:26,296
We have a memorable meeting.

237
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:29,030
We get to know each other
over a few casual meals,

238
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,870
he helps me through
an emotional crisis,

239
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,307
then I meet his friends,

240
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:34,505
if he has any,

241
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:36,308
then I let him teach me something...

242
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:37,905
But the bottom line is,

243
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,117
he bonds with me.

244
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,945
He lets go of you.

245
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:42,519
He moves out.

246
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:47,017
But how do you make sure
that he'll fall in love with you?

247
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:49,219
You look nice,
you find out what they like,

248
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,228
and then you pretend to like it, too.

249
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,355
That is pretty much how it works.

250
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,060
What about sex?

251
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,295
Al, I never have sex with a client.

252
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:01,498
Besides, I need to keep Tripp motivated,

253
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:04,833
and let's face it, after men have sex...

254
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:08,109
Is there anything that we need to do?

255
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:11,240
Well, for starters, you could make life
a little more difficult for him.

256
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:15,343
You know, more chores,
more responsibilities, that kind of thing.

257
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:18,685
I just think you should know that Tripp
has had some rough breaks.

258
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,850
I promise you, when this is over,

259
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,793
Tripp is going to be an independent,

260
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:26,057
self-sufficient adult.

261
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,463
Shut up, dude! Don't help him!

262
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:30,296
-Watch the safety. No, no, no.
-No, he's in a run defense...

263
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:31,699
Don't do it! Don't do it! I got you!
I got you!

264
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:33,829
-Throw it to Moss. Throw it to Moss!
-Watch out! I'm going deep!

265
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:35,429
No, you don't! Shit!

266
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,565
That's a bad word, Jeffrey.

267
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:39,337
So is "bastard," but that just means
your parents aren't married.

268
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:40,742
-Look at him! Look at him!
-No! Shit!

269
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:42,143
He could go all the way!

270
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:43,579
Touchdown!

271
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:45,149
Yes!

272
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,117
-Sit down!
-That's a face!

273
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,178
That's great, man.

274
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:50,755
That's good sportsmanship.
Nice dance.

275
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:54,087
Wow, my forehead itches.

276
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:58,060
That's cool, the "L" for loser.
Keep it up, little man.

277
00:14:58,163 --> 00:14:59,425
I'll make you walk home.

278
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:00,691
Hell, you are such a good uncle.

279
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,733
That's like eight miles.
It'll take you two days.

280
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:03,995
-Hey, boys.
-Hey.

281
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:05,570
-Hi.
-Tripp, we're going out.

282
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:08,162
All right, listen, you got any more
chips and salsa downstairs?

283
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,105
Oh, I didn't get to the store.

284
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:12,110
But you could go.

285
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:16,207
And you said you needed
your basketball shorts,

286
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:17,714
so I put them in the laundry.

287
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:19,943
-Right. Thank you, babe.
-But I didn't get to it.

288
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:22,145
So you're going to need to do a load.

289
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,346
A load?

290
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:27,357
And your bathroom needs cleaning,
so I left the stuff in the hall.

291
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:28,926
And when you're done
with the rubber gloves,

292
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:31,258
just remember to turn them inside out.

293
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:32,631
Bye.

294
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,101
Something's wrong with your mom.

295
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:42,833
This is really nice.

296
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,910
I've never actually been
on a sailboat before.

297
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,637
Hey, I'd be fine

298
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,780
if I never set foot on solid ground again.

299
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:51,509
You know, I bet I'd really love it
if we ever left the dock.

300
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,743
Well, yeah!

301
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:54,682
But to actually take you out on the water
on a first date

302
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,379
would be very forward of me, Paula.

303
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:58,956
Well, so far I must say
I'm very impressed.

304
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:01,754
Beautiful setting, a simple meal...

305
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:04,085
I assume this technique
has worked in the past?

306
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,957
Yes, ma'am, it has.

307
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,390
Is it working now?

308
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:09,558
You know what? It kind of is.

309
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:14,338
Let's go for a walk.

310
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,533
But I'm not done with lunch.

311
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,177
Yeah, you are.

312
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,244
Seriously, I'm not one of those girls
who don't eat. I want...

313
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,749
I wanted all of that.

314
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:28,081
See, technically, this is not my boat.

315
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,883
Actually, it's not my boat in any way.

316
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,824
-What?
-I'm a boat broker. I sell boats.

317
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:37,555
I would love to own a boat like this,
but it's not the right time in my life.

318
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,063
Besides, the guy
who does own this boat

319
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,894
is right behind you.

320
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:45,531
Hey there, Mr. Axelrod!
I thought you were out of town!

321
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:47,730
Well, I was, and now I'm not.

322
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:51,240
What's going on? Is that a fork?
Are you eating on my boat?

323
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:52,310
No.

324
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,506
When did you redo the galley?

325
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,110
Oh, you're in the market?

326
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,186
Might be. What's she draw?

327
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:02,685
Seven-three.

328
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:04,620
Cherry's a little dark.

329
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:06,489
The wife picked it.

330
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:08,023
It's got nice lines.

331
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:09,685
She's fast, too.

332
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:12,424
Well, she certainly is yare.

333
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,091
I'll think about it. Thanks for your time.

334
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,668
Yes, ma'am.

335
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:18,970
Thank you.

336
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:23,905
You're gonna let her walk away?

337
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:26,409
I'm giving her space, Mr. Axelrod.

338
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,740
Now,

339
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:31,949
I'm going after her.

340
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:39,548
Excuse me, ma'am.
"She certainly is yare"?

341
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:40,989
<i>Philadelphia Story.</i>

342
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:42,219
Sweet.

343
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:46,630
All right, assuming
that pretending to own a yacht

344
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:50,168
was a brilliant, romantic,
yet ultimately flawed idea,

345
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,499
how do you see the rest of the date
playing out?

346
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:56,836
I don't know. I'm so hungry I can't think.
Seagulls ate my lunch.

347
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:58,674
What if I take you to a restaurant?

348
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:00,335
Are you gonna pretend to own it?

349
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:03,643
No. All the restaurants I own
are in Europe.

350
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,718
Well, hey there, Ace.
Glad you could make it, man.

351
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:14,918
We thought you went home.

352
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:18,519
I fell into a deep, dark crevasse.
I was so scared.

353
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:20,593
Did you go out with La-Z-Girl?

354
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:22,826
Paula. I did. We had lunch.

355
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,425
Will there be a second date?

356
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:26,163
There will be a second date.

357
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,239
Yet the relationship
is doomed to failure.

358
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,740
Right. And why are we doomed?

359
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:33,567
You live with your parents?

360
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:34,668
He's right.

361
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,238
Your entire life is set up perfectly
for ending relationships.

362
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,476
We've been out one time.

363
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:42,019
She's a nice girl, I'm a nice guy,
we had fun.

364
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,214
And I must tell you, son,

365
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:47,686
nothing is doomed.

366
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:15,811
Gnarly crash!

367
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,486
What are you doing?

368
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:20,957
Remember, we're the visitors here.

369
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,025
Come on.

370
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:29,861
-Wow. You're feeding it a little peanut?
-Yeah.

371
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:32,061
He gets that stuff all the time, man.

372
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:33,798
This is what he wants.

373
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:35,703
You want a treat from the big city, boy?

374
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,741
He's not a child, Tripp.

375
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:40,205
Look how peaceful he is.

376
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:41,472
Come here, little boy.

377
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,775
You want a little bit of chocolate,
baby-boo-boo?

378
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:45,110
You're giving him a PowerBar?

379
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:46,844
Everybody loves chocolate.

380
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:49,152
Tripp, he's saying no.

381
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:50,585
Look into my eyes.

382
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,179
He's saying no, Tripp.

383
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:58,423
Tripp? Tripp? Dude?

384
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:02,861
Get off!

385
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,771
What is he doing? Is that a squirrel?

386
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,274
No, it's a chipmunk.

387
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:16,378
Watch the bike.

388
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,889
Oh, hey. I'm Tripp.

389
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:30,385
You must be Kit.

390
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,298
It's a mockingbird.

391
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,492
Who did what?

392
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:38,001
It's a mockingbird.

393
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:39,365
What is?

394
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:42,235
You don't hear that?
That annoying noise.

395
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:44,304
Oh, yeah, now I hear it.

396
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,467
I looked it up.

397
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,637
They can imitate car alarms,
and telephones, and other birds.

398
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,612
I called Animal Control,
and you know what they said?

399
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:54,482
They said I should just enjoy
one of nature's most talented singers.

400
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,554
-Yeah.
-I'm gonna kill it.

401
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,724
Okay, I'm all set.

402
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:01,389
-Oh, wow.
-Hi.

403
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:02,755
Wow, look at you.

404
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:04,226
Well, look at you.

405
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:05,761
Sweet shoes.

406
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:07,592
Really? Thanks.

407
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,901
Okay, well, Kit, we're gonna go.
See you.

408
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:12,436
-You ready?
-Yeah.

409
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:14,198
Okay, you two kids have a blast.

410
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:17,207
-Thanks.
-Hey, Kit, good luck with the...

411
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,244
It's a chipmunk bite.

412
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:29,013
I figured.
Obviously not a normal chipmunk.

413
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,145
You're right about that.

414
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:34,851
No, this was like a big, oversized, like,
bobcat, grizzly-bear chipmunk.

415
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:36,995
I'm pretty fortunate to still be here.

416
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:38,255
-Wow.
-Yeah.

417
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:39,330
What did the doctor say?

418
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:40,523
I didn't need to see a doctor.

419
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,328
I had some cream at home
that I put on it.

420
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,527
-You had chipmunk cream?
-Yeah.

421
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,229
-Wow, that's lucky.
-Isn't it?

422
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:50,932
I take it you like Japanese food.

423
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:52,340
Oh, I love it.

424
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:54,878
I'm also gonna order a huge dessert,
drink too much,

425
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,811
and maybe talk about my old boyfriends.

426
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:58,473
-Yeah?
-Does that intimidate you?

427
00:21:58,583 --> 00:21:59,914
Not at all.

428
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:01,911
Cheers, Paula.

429
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,214
Cheers.

430
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:10,288
All right, T-R-l-double-P going in
to get a little squid.

431
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:13,821
Do you need me to help you with that?

432
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:16,526
I got it. I got it. Look at this, look at this.

433
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:17,997
I admire the confidence.

434
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:20,071
Thank you. I am fairly...

435
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:23,266
ambidextrous.

436
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:26,403
Oh, shit.

437
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,911
I'm sorry! Excuse me.

438
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,572
Squid's a little bit greasy tonight.

439
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,445
Sorry. Yeah.

440
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:33,813
That's not easy to do.

441
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,181
I didn't see anything.

442
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,756
Tell me about yourself.
What do you do for a living?

443
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,624
I teach special needs kids.

444
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:48,621
-How's the hand?
-It's fine.

445
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:49,758
-Is it throbbing?
-No.

446
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:52,098
Is the medication wearing off?

447
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:54,305
Gotta scratch.

448
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:57,434
Oh, yeah.

449
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:58,509
Well,

450
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,543
home again.

451
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:03,039
Home again.

452
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:04,272
I had a nice time.

453
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,407
I did, too.

454
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:06,711
Good.

455
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,045
I had fun.

456
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:09,211
Good.

457
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:14,856
Shut up!
Shut up you crazy bastard bird bitch!

458
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:17,092
Hey, Kit!

459
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:18,724
What? Hi.

460
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:21,188
Can you guys see me?

461
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:22,266
-Yeah!
-Yeah.

462
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:24,062
Oh. Great.

463
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:27,396
What?

464
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,533
Dinner and a show.

465
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,076
Good night.

466
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:37,783
Good night.

467
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:39,974
Now, what type of a boat
do you see yourself in?

468
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,313
Well, I'm not sure.

469
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,581
But I do know that I need
to be out in the open sea.

470
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:45,656
Well, you gotta ask yourself
some questions.

471
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,384
Do you like speed?

472
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,685
Do you like to hear
the roar of an engine?

473
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:52,696
Do you want to get from point A
to point B as quickly as possible?

474
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:54,663
If that turns you on,
then you want a powerboat.

475
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,633
Okay, that's it. That's it.
Power. That's me. Yes.

476
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:00,068
Well, that's one way to go.
But maybe you want to slow down.

477
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:02,072
You know, listen to the wind
and the water.

478
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:04,608
Have sunrise and sunset
as your only clock.

479
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:06,438
Know that you could go
around the world

480
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:08,672
on less than a tank of gas.

481
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:13,573
Now, if that sounds good to you,
then maybe you're sailors.

482
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:16,210
This is not a hobby. This...

483
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:17,677
It's a lifestyle.

484
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:20,451
Well, now that is passion!

485
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,220
-What has happened to you?
-What's happened to me?

486
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:23,988
I want to feel the wind.

487
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:25,153
I do not want to feel...

488
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:27,197
I want to make the wind, okay? Look...

489
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,527
-Make the wind?
-Yeah. I'm not a sailor.

490
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,191
You don't make wind
sitting on a boat in a dock.

491
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,702
I'm a power guy. Power.
Like "power boat."

492
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:33,793
-You're a power guy?
-Excuse me.

493
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:36,269
-I want to feel that beneath...
-Guys who drink Kahlua and cream

494
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:38,239
are not power guys, honey.

495
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:39,469
Tripp.

496
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:44,205
Whoa, slow down, slow down, Paula.

497
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,716
Mr. Fritz was my best friend

498
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,511
since he was a little puppy.

499
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:53,691
Just a little fur ball.

500
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:57,317
He was too small
to even jump up on the bed

501
00:24:57,562 --> 00:24:59,052
and now he's...

502
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:01,899
He's...

503
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:04,429
Got a tissue or something?

504
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:09,206
-He saved my life, you know.
-He did?

505
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:13,368
And now I can't do
anything for him, and I...

506
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,321
Oh, shit.

507
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:36,590
I'm so glad you're here.

508
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:41,701
Yeah, of course I am.

509
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:48,405
Can I have a minute alone with him?

510
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:51,073
Thank you.

511
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:53,207
-I'll be right outside.
-Okay.

512
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:03,321
Thanks, Gretchen.

513
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:04,622
Anytime.

514
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,621
Gosh, Emotional Crisis Day
is so critical.

515
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,893
I cry, he cries.

516
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:11,525
It totally bonds us.

517
00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:13,228
So how long do you think
he's gonna sleep for?

518
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:15,306
Half an hour.
He's only here for some dental work.

519
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,841
Oh. What's his real name, anyway?

520
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:18,967
I don't know.

521
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:21,238
I just clean their teeth
and chop their balls off.

522
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,319
God, that is so sad.

523
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,013
Yeah, it was a beautiful dog, man.

524
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:32,521
She was devastated.

525
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:35,024
Well, this is exactly what she needs.
Good choice.

526
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:37,686
-There she is. Hey, Paula.
-Hi.

527
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:40,356
Paula, these are my good friends,
Demo and Ace. Guys, Paula.

528
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:41,591
Hi, it's nice to meet you.

529
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,362
-I'm so sorry for your loss.
-Come on, don't.

530
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:45,697
Thank you.

531
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:48,102
-Nice suit. How you doing?
-Thank you. Hi.

532
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:52,639
You know, most guys would've
sent flowers, chocolates maybe,

533
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:56,077
but I gotta say,
I did not see this coming.

534
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:58,911
Well, you know,
anybody can send flowers, Paula.

535
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:01,918
Now, I'm going to let you in
on "the" secret.

536
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:05,147
It's called the "finger roll."
Quick fingers, light on the trigger.

537
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:06,985
See, double trigger...

538
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:10,485
More paintballs in less time
means victory.

539
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:11,857
Let's see it.

540
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,123
When you're out there today

541
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:16,200
and you got these paintballs
flying at you at over 200 miles an hour,

542
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:20,032
I guarantee you will not be thinking
about the late, great Mr. Fritz.

543
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:23,772
Holy moly. They really move that fast?

544
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:26,742
Oh, my God!

545
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:29,605
I'm so sorry!

546
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:30,840
Nice shot!

547
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:32,507
-Oh, thanks.
-He's okay.

548
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,751
Let's go shoot some strangers, huh?

549
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,492
First one to paint the skirt gets a beer.

550
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,201
I think that guy just laughed at me.
Who are these guys?

551
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:54,203
They go by "Devil Babies."

552
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:56,330
They finished third
in the National Championship.

553
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:58,102
This should be an excellent test
of our skills.

554
00:27:58,209 --> 00:28:00,302
-Wait. These guys are champions?
-All right, all right.

555
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:02,107
They didn't win it.

556
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:04,504
Go!

557
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:06,143
Move, move, move!

558
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:07,582
Let's go!

559
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:11,187
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

560
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:12,390
Oh, my God!

561
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,591
Let's go! Go, go, go, go!

562
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:21,462
There you are! Look alive!

563
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,000
I'm out.

564
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:26,336
-Watch out!
-Watch it!

565
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:28,030
Come on, blondie!

566
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:45,016
Am I out?

567
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:59,301
I didn't know they sold beer here.

568
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:01,631
They don't.

569
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:07,444
There you go! Stay down, Paula!
Stay down!

570
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:12,973
Can I have one?

571
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:15,742
No.

572
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:17,046
Check it out!

573
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:28,599
Warm day, huh?

574
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:37,941
Nice talking to you.

575
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,077
Damn it!

576
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:44,739
Paula?

577
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:46,441
Sorry! Sorry!

578
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:48,416
Does it count if it was an accident?

579
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:50,849
Bad finger roll.

580
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,820
All right, I need you to come to me.

581
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:55,825
No, thanks. I'm just gonna
stay over here till it's over.

582
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:56,951
-Now!
-Okay.

583
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:02,421
I'm out.

584
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,202
Shit! I'm out!

585
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,898
-You will not have died in vain!
-Stay down.

586
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:11,032
Paula, where are you?

587
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:13,841
Finger roll. Finger roll. Finger roll.

588
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:17,904
Oh, Tinkerbell!
Come out, come out, wherever you are!

589
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:21,645
The sooner you lose,
the sooner you can go shopping!

590
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:25,654
Oh, man!

591
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,755
Who's laughing now?

592
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:32,927
You did it!

593
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:35,830
-Get out of here!
-Boy, you made it!

594
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:36,992
Come on!

595
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:38,329
Where'd that come from?

596
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:40,027
-Look at you!
-I love it.

597
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:41,503
-Hey, Kit!
-Kind of fun, huh?

598
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:44,234
You know what?
I'm gonna go powder my nose.

599
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,811
I take it you're over
your dead golden retriever.

600
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:50,745
You know, if I really had a dog
and he really had died,

601
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,215
I think this would have totally helped.

602
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:55,616
Man, she's got good spatial awareness.

603
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:56,912
And great hair!

604
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,613
-Thanks.
-She's a keeper, man.

605
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:00,816
She's really great. Really great, Tripp.

606
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:02,517
So can we go now?

607
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:04,895
Meeting the friends is very important.

608
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:06,964
Guys need to know
we not only like them,

609
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:09,033
but we like their friends, too.

610
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:12,102
Fine. The tall one's kind of cute.
What's he do?

611
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,761
Oh, he's some kind of software writer.

612
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,499
He works out of his basement,
but he makes a lot of money.

613
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:17,268
Oh, you know what?
No, that's the little guy.

614
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:20,037
The tall one just got fired from Kinko's.

615
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:23,437
How will I choose?

616
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,072
This is going very well.

617
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:27,310
Good. So we can go now.

618
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:29,849
Not until I get "the nod."

619
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:33,151
If I don't get "the nod,"
the friends undermine.

620
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:37,027
I think you're getting "the nod."

621
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,397
Oh, yeah.

622
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:43,598
Oh, Tripp is just cruising
through the steps.

623
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:48,001
In fact, I think tomorrow
I'm gonna let him teach me something.

624
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:03,118
Now, basically there's two ways
to turn a boat.

625
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:06,221
There's "coming about,"
which is turning into the wind,

626
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:08,554
and there's "jibing,"
which is turning away from the wind.

627
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,595
Now, jibing is something that you
never want to do with a rookie onboard,

628
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:13,459
so let's give it a shot, huh?

629
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:15,964
Well, wait, wait, wait.
Why is jibing bad?

630
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:18,399
It's not bad, it's just fun. Jibe ho!

631
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:20,528
Come on, babe! Let's get over there!

632
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,501
Come on, boy!

633
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:33,810
Oh, my God!

634
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:37,715
Nothing like the threat of decapitation
to make it a little more interesting.

635
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:43,221
Make off this sheet, like so.

636
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:47,264
Okay.

637
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:51,224
"Jibe ho" and "making off the sheet"?

638
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:54,897
That's too many words to learn.
I just want to get a suntan.

639
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,398
Here, take the wheel.

640
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:58,202
What? Really?

641
00:32:58,309 --> 00:32:59,298
Oh, yeah.

642
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:00,434
All right.

643
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:02,274
-We call it the helm.
-Okay.

644
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,745
Wait, wait, wait! What are you doing?

645
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:05,145
I'm going down below.

646
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:06,574
What's down below?

647
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:08,413
I don't know, beer, wine, chips, rum.

648
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:10,146
I don't know. It's not my boat.

649
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:12,482
But I don't know what I'm doing!
I'm not kidding! Seriously!

650
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,852
You're sailing!

651
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:15,425
What if I hit something?

652
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,634
I think you'll be okay. Fly.

653
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:25,269
Wow.

654
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:28,096
I'm sailing.

655
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:43,980
Oh, man.

656
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:46,485
That's gorgeous!

657
00:33:56,701 --> 00:34:00,137
You know, I thought going on a boat
was a good idea because you like it,

658
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:03,401
but my God! That was great!

659
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:07,476
You should buy that boat! I mean,
I'm sure it's expensive, but so what?

660
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,375
Well, I like that boat, but I really don't...

661
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:12,809
Nice.

662
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:15,512
I don't really want a new boat.

663
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:18,646
What I would love
is an old wooden boat.

664
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:22,589
Now, they're a lot more upkeep,
but when you're on one of those,

665
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:25,694
it's like you're part of something,
you know?

666
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:30,828
It's like you're connected, you know,
to the original seafaring people

667
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:33,199
who set sail into the unknown
and said things like,

668
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:35,397
"Holy crap, that's a big wave!"

669
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,774
So do it. Buy a crummy old boat.

670
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:41,940
Who cares,
as long as you're out there?

671
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:44,139
Well, I'm working on it.

672
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,644
The thing is, you gotta be ready.
I mean, it's a big commitment.

673
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,845
And if you're not ready, you just end up,

674
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:52,787
well, a Ionely guy
with a big boat payment.

675
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:54,955
Who says you have to be Ionely?

676
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:27,614
-Hey.
-Oh, hey! Hi!

677
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:28,953
I didn't know you were home.

678
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:32,052
Yeah, everyone from work
went to T.G.I. Friday's,

679
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:34,461
but I don't really like that place.

680
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:36,726
-Or anyone I work with.
-Oh, good.

681
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:39,894
So then we can stay in and watch
one of those drinking movies you like.

682
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:41,130
Yeah.

683
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,077
I smell something.

684
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:49,504
Do you smell something?

685
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:54,176
Oh, Tripp and I had crab today.

686
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,112
No, that's not it.

687
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:58,952
I smell fun.

688
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:02,350
What?

689
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,951
You are a dirty little fun-haver.

690
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:08,657
That is absurd.
Tripp is a fascinating case.

691
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:11,257
He doesn't fit the usual profile.

692
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:12,393
Of losers and shut-ins?

693
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,596
I actually don't even see
why he still lives at home.

694
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:17,299
He's got a good job,
he's got normal social skills,

695
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:19,569
he's attractive,

696
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:21,945
he's really sweet.

697
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:28,776
That's so nice that you get to hang out
with such a sweet guy every day.

698
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:36,659
It was a rewarding
and successful work day. That's all.

699
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:37,728
Okay.

700
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:41,491
And at the end of it,
I looked into his eyes,

701
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:43,133
and I saw it.

702
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:45,601
I've got him.

703
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:49,400
He is as good as moved out.

704
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:53,368
It's over. She's gotta go.

705
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,704
You're dumping Paula?

706
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:57,337
-What happened?
-Same thing that always happens.

707
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:59,006
Everything is going along
nice and smooth,

708
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:00,105
we're having a good time,

709
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,686
and all of a sudden, out of nowhere...

710
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:04,113
She gets serious.

711
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:07,953
I hate to say it, boys,
but it is time to take the girl home.

712
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,788
-You're doing it again.
-What?

713
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:13,830
The thing where the woman gets close
and you pull the relationship ripcord.

714
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:16,331
Guys, it's simple. The fun's gone.

715
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:19,426
Hey, guys, check this out!

716
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:22,500
Hey, boy!

717
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:26,472
Come here, boy. Come here, boy.

718
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:28,906
What's he saying, Demo?

719
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:32,773
Where'd you go?

720
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:33,907
Where'd he go?

721
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:36,213
-Let me ask you something, Demo.
-Yeah.

722
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,948
How's this surfing
if there are no waves?

723
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:42,793
Tripp?

724
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:50,393
Should we go after him?

725
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:51,661
Well, he's their passenger now.

726
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:54,966
Passenger?
He just took him underwater!

727
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:56,901
Take me!

728
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:01,672
Oh, shit!

729
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:04,637
Oh, shit! The son of a bitch bit me!

730
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:09,712
So you were bit by a dolphin?

731
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:12,948
Yeah. And not just any dolphin, either.

732
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:15,719
This was a great white dolphin,
all right?

733
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:18,289
I'm lucky to still be here.

734
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:24,928
What?

735
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:28,532
Nothing.

736
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:33,677
Wow!

737
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,207
-This is your house?
-Yeah.

738
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,214
-It's beautiful.
-Thank you.

739
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:41,274
I like to come home to a nice place.

740
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:45,649
-Come on in.
-Thank you.

741
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:49,852
-It's very pretty.
-Thank you.

742
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,689
-You want something to drink?
-Yeah, sure.

743
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:53,263
Beer? Glass of wine?

744
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:54,956
-Sure, wine would be great, thanks.
-Glass of wine.

745
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:56,033
Thanks.

746
00:38:56,233 --> 00:38:59,100
Hey, Mom, Pop,
I thought y'all were going out.

747
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:03,003
Out? What would we go out for?
We've got those brand-new chairs!

748
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:05,901
Hello.

749
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:12,172
Tripp, who's your little friend?

750
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:13,773
Mom, Dad, this is Paula.

751
00:39:13,884 --> 00:39:17,411
Paula, this is my mom, my dad,
Sue and Al.

752
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:20,188
Wow! Well!

753
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:22,020
-Hello. How do you do?
-Hello.

754
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:23,286
Hi.

755
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:26,086
It's a great pleasure to meet you both.

756
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,494
Hi, Paula.

757
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:30,434
Wow.

758
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:38,567
So you...

759
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:40,871
You live with your parents.

760
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:45,446
Is that a problem?

761
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,948
No.

762
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:56,721
Not for me.

763
00:39:58,362 --> 00:40:00,262
Would you like to stay for dinner?

764
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,424
Oh! Wow. I'd love to. Thank you.

765
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:04,796
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Why?

766
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:08,497
Well, it smells good,
and I'm really hungry. Aren't you?

767
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:11,769
Yeah, I'm hungry.
But my mom here, she's cooking dinner.

768
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:13,366
Like she does most nights.

769
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:15,205
Right here, where I live,

770
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:16,540
with them,

771
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:19,979
in the same house I grew up in.

772
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:22,017
That's nice.

773
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:25,084
I'm gonna go mow the lawn.

774
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:27,019
Well, we're about to sit down...

775
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:29,319
Might mow the neighbor's, too.

776
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:33,995
Is this really okay? 'Cause I don't want
to intrude on family time.

777
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,396
Oh, it's fine. I'll set another place.

778
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,933
Okay, thanks.

779
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,768
I'm gonna go help Dad.

780
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,607
Is there...

781
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:46,107
Is there anything I can do to help?

782
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:48,576
Listen, I am so sorry.

783
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:52,080
I had no idea that he was
going to bring me over here.

784
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:54,578
But you are doing great.

785
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:57,711
Well, you're not.
I don't know what to tell you, honey,

786
00:40:57,822 --> 00:41:00,188
but that strict program of yours?

787
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:02,817
You're gonna have to start deviating.

788
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:04,258
He's breaking up with you.

789
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:05,350
What?

790
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,863
The only reason
he ever brings girls home to meet us

791
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,762
is 'cause he's getting ready
to dump them.

792
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:11,027
Really?

793
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:13,737
Well,

794
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:15,730
that's not happening.

795
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:22,508
-Hey, Paula? Hey, sweetie?
-Yes?

796
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:26,140
I appreciate you staying
for dinner, all right?

797
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,808
And I know that must have been
very awkward.

798
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:29,215
Not at all.

799
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,582
Not at all?

800
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:37,391
You don't mind that my parents
are downstairs right now?

801
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,326
They're asleep in their chairs.

802
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:42,257
Don't stare.

803
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,867
I'm paying for it. I'll stare if I want to.

804
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:52,205
I'm just saying, you know, they might...

805
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:54,406
They might hear us.

806
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:57,345
Why? Are you a screamer?

807
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,076
Paula?

808
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:40,449
Hey, you're up! Wow, early risers.

809
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:43,322
Hey, listen.
FYI, work-wise, we're definitely on track.

810
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:44,894
Things are good. Tripp is good.

811
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:46,656
Well, actually, he's fantastic.

812
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:48,994
Of course, I don't need to tell you that.
You're his parents.

813
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:53,229
I'm just trying to say, you should be
very proud of him.

814
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:55,438
Well...

815
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,071
You got a lovely home.

816
00:43:06,882 --> 00:43:08,816
I'm sorry, miss, you're not allowed
to eat that in the store.

817
00:43:08,917 --> 00:43:09,975
Fine.

818
00:43:37,078 --> 00:43:39,979
I need to buy a gun.
How much is this big gun here?

819
00:43:40,081 --> 00:43:43,812
That's a 12-gauge shotgun.
That's a pretty powerful weapon.

820
00:43:43,919 --> 00:43:45,409
You know, for a woman your size,

821
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,886
I'd probably recommend something
a little, you know...

822
00:43:47,989 --> 00:43:48,978
More compact?

823
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:52,253
So I just point, and then I squeeze
the trigger and then boom.

824
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:55,090
Yeah. What did you say
you were shooting?

825
00:43:55,197 --> 00:43:58,894
Twelve hundred bucks? Wow.
How much are the bullets for this?

826
00:44:02,571 --> 00:44:05,540
Shells. Shotguns use shells.
Anyway. Whatever.

827
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,631
They're 15 bucks for a box of 25.

828
00:44:07,742 --> 00:44:10,506
Okay, I don't need a whole box.
I just need...

829
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:12,947
one.

830
00:44:16,017 --> 00:44:16,984
You know,

831
00:44:20,188 --> 00:44:22,179
I get sad sometimes, too.

832
00:44:23,658 --> 00:44:26,149
So many pressures in life, you know?

833
00:44:26,795 --> 00:44:30,026
Can I give you a phone number
for some people who can help...

834
00:44:30,131 --> 00:44:31,655
Oh, no.

835
00:44:31,766 --> 00:44:33,097
It's like a hotline.

836
00:44:33,201 --> 00:44:36,568
Listen, sunshine, I'm not

837
00:44:36,671 --> 00:44:38,298
-suicidal.
-No, I know.

838
00:44:38,406 --> 00:44:42,035
I just have a problem
with a mockingbird.

839
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:43,707
Okay,

840
00:44:43,812 --> 00:44:46,906
-you can't kill a mockingbird.
-Why not?

841
00:44:47,015 --> 00:44:49,882
Well, for one, there's the book
<i>To Kill a Mockingbird.</i>

842
00:44:50,352 --> 00:44:52,047
A copy of that, too, right here.

843
00:44:52,153 --> 00:44:56,351
No, it's not a manual
on how to kill mockingbirds.

844
00:44:56,458 --> 00:44:59,791
It's a classic American novel.
How do you not know this?

845
00:45:00,562 --> 00:45:02,291
I know a lot of other things.
Give me the gun!

846
00:45:02,397 --> 00:45:03,386
-No!
-Yes!

847
00:45:03,498 --> 00:45:04,795
I'm not gonna sell you this gun.

848
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:07,892
Mockingbirds are protected under
the Federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act.

849
00:45:08,003 --> 00:45:09,095
Killing one is a crime.

850
00:45:09,204 --> 00:45:10,967
Look, this is insane.

851
00:45:11,106 --> 00:45:12,505
I have rights, too, you know.

852
00:45:12,607 --> 00:45:14,939
Or maybe you haven't heard
of the Sixth Amendment!

853
00:45:15,043 --> 00:45:17,568
The right to a speedy and public trial?

854
00:45:19,347 --> 00:45:21,281
You. You're on my list,

855
00:45:21,516 --> 00:45:22,483
Jim.

856
00:45:22,684 --> 00:45:26,142
I got great boat shoes.

857
00:45:26,254 --> 00:45:27,243
Hi.

858
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:30,258
-What's going on?
-Nothing.

859
00:45:30,358 --> 00:45:32,986
I got shoes for the next time
Tripp and I go sailing.

860
00:45:33,094 --> 00:45:34,789
And they're not just cute.

861
00:45:34,896 --> 00:45:36,363
Tripp says they're actually
very practical.

862
00:45:36,464 --> 00:45:37,761
They have these little ridges
on the bottom...

863
00:45:37,866 --> 00:45:39,424
Wait, wait, wait, slow down.

864
00:45:39,534 --> 00:45:40,592
Look at me.

865
00:45:40,702 --> 00:45:44,069
-What happened last night?
-What happened last night?

866
00:45:44,472 --> 00:45:46,099
I tried to end it.

867
00:45:46,308 --> 00:45:48,173
Tried, as in "you failed"?

868
00:45:48,276 --> 00:45:49,368
Yeah.

869
00:45:50,278 --> 00:45:52,610
But the sex was fantastic.

870
00:45:52,714 --> 00:45:54,477
You had sex with him?

871
00:45:54,583 --> 00:45:57,381
This is not a big deal.

872
00:45:57,485 --> 00:46:01,182
What was that rule that you had about
never ever having sex with clients?

873
00:46:01,289 --> 00:46:04,315
Oh, yeah,
"I never ever have sex with my clients."

874
00:46:04,426 --> 00:46:07,520
Those are my rules.
I can change them if I need to.

875
00:46:07,629 --> 00:46:09,494
It's not like I don't know what I'm doing.

876
00:46:09,598 --> 00:46:10,860
So your parents weren't home?

877
00:46:10,966 --> 00:46:12,695
No, they were downstairs.

878
00:46:15,937 --> 00:46:17,734
-And you were upstairs?
-Yeah.

879
00:46:18,039 --> 00:46:20,166
Look, I am still in control.

880
00:46:20,275 --> 00:46:24,302
This was a one-time
emergency situation.

881
00:46:24,412 --> 00:46:26,039
You know what? It's very complicated.

882
00:46:26,147 --> 00:46:29,139
I don't have time right now
to explain to you how business works.

883
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:32,083
You don't need to explain to me
how business works. I'm not an idiot.

884
00:46:32,187 --> 00:46:33,449
Do you know that I have a contract?

885
00:46:33,555 --> 00:46:38,458
I have fiduciary responsibilities
to uphold.

886
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,358
From a fiduciary standpoint,
would you say that you had an orgasm?

887
00:46:43,732 --> 00:46:45,666
Come on! Were we talking to you?

888
00:46:45,767 --> 00:46:46,893
No. Clean that mess up.

889
00:46:47,002 --> 00:46:49,766
Hey, hey! Hey. Can we please
discuss this someplace else?

890
00:46:51,239 --> 00:46:53,901
That's okay, you guys can stay here
if you want.

891
00:46:56,945 --> 00:46:58,276
What are you gonna do now?

892
00:46:58,380 --> 00:46:59,506
I don't know.

893
00:47:00,749 --> 00:47:03,217
I'm in uncharted waters here, boys.

894
00:47:04,219 --> 00:47:06,915
My mom thinks it's her dog,
but I do all the work.

895
00:47:07,022 --> 00:47:08,455
I mean, you don't brush an Irish setter...

896
00:47:08,556 --> 00:47:10,421
-You have an Irish setter?
-Yeah!

897
00:47:10,525 --> 00:47:11,787
I have a yellow Lab!

898
00:47:11,893 --> 00:47:13,656
I mean, he's getting kind of old,

899
00:47:13,762 --> 00:47:15,525
but we should definitely
get them together.

900
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:16,995
We should...

901
00:47:17,365 --> 00:47:20,493
God, I'm so lucky. I mean, I'm so lucky.

902
00:47:20,602 --> 00:47:23,594
I mean, look at you, and look at me.

903
00:47:23,705 --> 00:47:25,832
Hey, I mean, come on, look at you.

904
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:28,670
You're smart, you're attractive,

905
00:47:28,777 --> 00:47:31,245
you love the original <i>Star Wars</i> trilogy,

906
00:47:31,346 --> 00:47:34,782
because it's all about
storytelling, and myth,

907
00:47:34,883 --> 00:47:37,010
before CGI ruined everything.

908
00:47:37,118 --> 00:47:40,053
I mean, come on, what girl
wouldn't want to be with you?

909
00:47:40,155 --> 00:47:41,850
A shocking number, actually.

910
00:47:41,956 --> 00:47:43,321
Well, you know what? It's their loss.

911
00:47:43,425 --> 00:47:44,858
You show me a guy who loves <i>Empire</i>

912
00:47:44,959 --> 00:47:48,087
and I will show you a guy
who's not afraid of his imagination.

913
00:47:48,329 --> 00:47:51,662
Like with Luke gets to the cave,
and he asks Yoda what's in there,

914
00:47:51,766 --> 00:47:53,256
and Yoda says...

915
00:47:53,668 --> 00:47:56,660
"Only what you take with you."

916
00:47:57,105 --> 00:48:01,337
But he goes in anyway, because
he is not afraid of his own mind!

917
00:48:01,443 --> 00:48:03,638
Walking the path of the Jedi, that's why.

918
00:48:03,745 --> 00:48:07,272
That's you! You're Luke!

919
00:48:10,485 --> 00:48:11,611
I gotta pee.

920
00:48:12,153 --> 00:48:13,211
Didn't you just go?

921
00:48:13,321 --> 00:48:15,016
Listen, listen, I'll be right back.

922
00:48:15,156 --> 00:48:16,646
Just don't go anywhere, okay?

923
00:48:16,758 --> 00:48:18,020
I'm not gonna go anywhere.

924
00:48:18,126 --> 00:48:19,218
All right, cool.

925
00:48:19,894 --> 00:48:21,759
But, really, don't go anywhere.

926
00:48:35,543 --> 00:48:36,532
Hiya, Paula.

927
00:48:36,644 --> 00:48:37,668
Oh, God!

928
00:48:37,779 --> 00:48:38,973
Shit!

929
00:48:39,681 --> 00:48:41,945
You scared the crap out of me.

930
00:48:43,251 --> 00:48:46,618
What you doing?
This isn't your usual place, is it?

931
00:48:47,322 --> 00:48:49,984
Just, you know, just...

932
00:48:50,425 --> 00:48:52,222
having lunch with a friend.

933
00:48:54,062 --> 00:48:56,553
You always hold your friends' hands?

934
00:48:57,465 --> 00:48:59,524
Like, then I touched...
We touched hand.

935
00:48:59,634 --> 00:49:01,158
I just touched his hand.

936
00:49:01,269 --> 00:49:03,362
Well, my friends never touch my hands.

937
00:49:07,976 --> 00:49:11,605
You've put me
in a very difficult position here.

938
00:49:15,483 --> 00:49:17,110
Okay, look, what do you want?

939
00:49:22,056 --> 00:49:23,045
No.

940
00:49:23,158 --> 00:49:25,786
It's just coffee.
You don't have to marry him.

941
00:49:25,894 --> 00:49:28,658
First of all,
that's the geeky computer guy.

942
00:49:28,763 --> 00:49:31,732
It's bad enough I have to go out
with a loser who still lives with his mom,

943
00:49:31,833 --> 00:49:35,667
but you led me to believe that it was
the handsome minimum-wage slacker.

944
00:49:37,105 --> 00:49:40,074
No, I don't think that I did that.

945
00:49:41,075 --> 00:49:42,565
Okay, I didn't have a choice.

946
00:49:42,677 --> 00:49:43,735
He was going to tell Tripp

947
00:49:43,845 --> 00:49:46,006
and you were the only
bargaining chip that I had.

948
00:49:46,114 --> 00:49:47,775
You should take that as a compliment.

949
00:49:47,882 --> 00:49:49,076
He's a troll.

950
00:49:49,184 --> 00:49:51,448
He's not a troll. He's... He's...

951
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:55,912
He's endearing, and quirky.

952
00:49:56,424 --> 00:49:57,857
Oh, for Christ's sake.

953
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:00,391
I'm coming!

954
00:50:06,034 --> 00:50:07,228
Damn it.

955
00:50:15,109 --> 00:50:16,235
I hope you like fish.

956
00:50:17,645 --> 00:50:19,442
So how does Paula do it, anyway?

957
00:50:19,547 --> 00:50:21,242
It seems like it would be hard on her.

958
00:50:21,349 --> 00:50:23,647
Does she ever get it confused
with her real life?

959
00:50:23,751 --> 00:50:26,549
What makes you think
she has a real life?

960
00:50:28,857 --> 00:50:31,018
It's just kind of a weird job.

961
00:50:31,259 --> 00:50:33,352
I mean, how does one
get into that field?

962
00:50:35,463 --> 00:50:37,522
A couple of years ago, she fell for a guy

963
00:50:37,632 --> 00:50:39,657
who wouldn't move out
of his parents' house.

964
00:50:39,767 --> 00:50:41,928
I don't know, I guess
because she couldn't fix him,

965
00:50:42,036 --> 00:50:44,334
she has to fix
all the other losers out there.

966
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:46,832
No offense.

967
00:50:47,742 --> 00:50:48,800
None taken.

968
00:50:49,677 --> 00:50:51,668
Listen, if you want to go, that's okay.

969
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:54,107
I'm sorry I slammed the door
on your face.

970
00:50:54,215 --> 00:50:56,308
I don't sleep much.

971
00:50:58,820 --> 00:50:59,809
Really?

972
00:51:00,455 --> 00:51:01,581
Me, either.

973
00:51:02,357 --> 00:51:05,190
Just have too much stuff going on
in my head. Is that the same thing?

974
00:51:05,293 --> 00:51:06,453
No, no.

975
00:51:07,729 --> 00:51:10,892
No. No. I want to sleep,

976
00:51:10,999 --> 00:51:13,399
but I can't, because there's a bird
outside my window

977
00:51:13,501 --> 00:51:16,163
and all night long it chirps,
and it chirps, and it chirps,

978
00:51:16,271 --> 00:51:18,796
and it's annoying,
and I can't get it to shut up!

979
00:51:23,811 --> 00:51:25,278
I have a BB gun.

980
00:51:33,388 --> 00:51:35,151
Go, Omaha!

981
00:51:37,892 --> 00:51:38,859
Yeah.

982
00:51:39,627 --> 00:51:41,492
Say, did you get my message today?

983
00:51:43,731 --> 00:51:45,028
No. You know what,
I had my phone turned off.

984
00:51:45,133 --> 00:51:48,000
I was having lunch with a girlfriend.

985
00:51:48,503 --> 00:51:50,869
My teacher, Miss Kramer,
has a girlfriend.

986
00:51:51,339 --> 00:51:52,670
Oh! That's nice.

987
00:51:52,774 --> 00:51:53,866
She's a lesbian.

988
00:51:54,742 --> 00:51:56,607
Well, don't act all cool about it!

989
00:51:57,078 --> 00:51:58,568
You're jealous 'cause you like her.

990
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,046
You're the one
who was always staring at her shirt.

991
00:52:02,016 --> 00:52:03,005
He's lying.

992
00:52:12,327 --> 00:52:13,851
I don't hear anything.

993
00:52:15,797 --> 00:52:16,991
He'll come.

994
00:52:18,433 --> 00:52:19,957
He always comes.

995
00:52:21,536 --> 00:52:23,197
How many times did you pump it?

996
00:52:25,707 --> 00:52:27,470
-Twice.
-Good.

997
00:52:27,575 --> 00:52:31,511
'Cause we don't want to kill it,
just sting it so it flies away.

998
00:52:32,981 --> 00:52:33,948
Yeah.

999
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:39,686
So, is Kit short for Katherine?

1000
00:52:40,888 --> 00:52:44,585
Yes. Is Ace short for

1001
00:52:45,493 --> 00:52:46,858
Ace-a-rooney?

1002
00:52:47,061 --> 00:52:48,892
No, it's a nickname.

1003
00:52:48,997 --> 00:52:51,329
What, are you really good at cards
or something?

1004
00:52:52,467 --> 00:52:56,426
Until I was 10,
I had an undescended testicle.

1005
00:53:03,911 --> 00:53:04,969
Wait!

1006
00:53:08,016 --> 00:53:09,040
There you are.

1007
00:53:09,984 --> 00:53:11,611
Say good night, birdie.

1008
00:53:14,522 --> 00:53:15,580
I got him!

1009
00:53:18,359 --> 00:53:20,589
You pumped it more than twice,
didn't you?

1010
00:53:22,864 --> 00:53:25,458
Oh, my God!
God, why'd you make me do that?

1011
00:53:26,501 --> 00:53:27,934
-Clear the table!
-Oh, God!

1012
00:53:28,169 --> 00:53:29,932
-Oh, my God! Is he okay?
-I don't know.

1013
00:53:30,038 --> 00:53:31,232
-Where's he hit?
-I don't know!

1014
00:53:31,339 --> 00:53:33,034
-Is he dead?
-I...

1015
00:53:33,141 --> 00:53:34,108
Oh, no!

1016
00:53:34,609 --> 00:53:37,703
Look! Look! The BB.

1017
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:40,104
Well, maybe it's just stunned.
Do you know CPR?

1018
00:53:40,214 --> 00:53:41,545
-Well, yeah, but...
-Do it!

1019
00:53:41,916 --> 00:53:43,042
-It's a bird!
-Do it!

1020
00:53:43,151 --> 00:53:46,518
Okay. Check vitals. Where's the pulse?

1021
00:53:47,155 --> 00:53:48,713
-Gently.
-Open the airway.

1022
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:50,753
-Don't hurt him!
-I'm not hurting him!

1023
00:53:50,858 --> 00:53:51,825
God!

1024
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:53,427
Okay. Be careful with him.

1025
00:53:53,528 --> 00:53:54,586
-He's little.
-I don't know.

1026
00:53:54,695 --> 00:53:57,289
Oh, my God, it's not working!
He's going!

1027
00:53:57,398 --> 00:53:59,195
Do something! We're losing him!

1028
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:00,460
Not on my watch!

1029
00:54:04,105 --> 00:54:05,902
One, one thousand, two, one thousand,
three, one thousand.

1030
00:54:06,007 --> 00:54:07,634
Walk away from the light, little buddy!

1031
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:11,444
One, one thousand, two, one thousand,
three, one thousand!

1032
00:54:11,546 --> 00:54:12,513
Please, God!

1033
00:54:14,882 --> 00:54:17,009
Oh, my God. Oh, my God! He's alive!

1034
00:54:29,363 --> 00:54:30,387
What the...

1035
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:43,772
I'm hungry.

1036
00:54:43,878 --> 00:54:47,814
Captain, you just had nachos,
two hot dogs, and a bag of peanuts.

1037
00:54:48,182 --> 00:54:50,116
I didn't have ice cream.

1038
00:54:50,318 --> 00:54:51,683
My bad.

1039
00:54:51,786 --> 00:54:53,253
Fine. Can I have a fruit bar?

1040
00:54:53,354 --> 00:54:54,321
Now you're getting good.

1041
00:54:54,422 --> 00:54:56,253
That's good. A negotiator here. All right.

1042
00:54:56,424 --> 00:54:57,652
Hey, wait for me.

1043
00:54:59,026 --> 00:55:01,085
Let's check with Miss Paula,
see if she needs anything.

1044
00:55:01,195 --> 00:55:04,062
Maybe a Royal's Number One
foam finger.

1045
00:55:04,165 --> 00:55:05,632
Don't come back without a foam finger.

1046
00:55:05,733 --> 00:55:06,927
You got it.

1047
00:55:14,876 --> 00:55:16,776
Tripp and Jeffrey are very cute together,
aren't they?

1048
00:55:16,878 --> 00:55:19,039
-Yeah. Listen, while we have a minute,
-Yeah?

1049
00:55:19,147 --> 00:55:20,580
...I really want to talk to you
about the whole

1050
00:55:20,681 --> 00:55:22,581
dating-my-best-friend-for-money thing.

1051
00:55:23,417 --> 00:55:24,907
-What?
-So, this must be the date

1052
00:55:25,019 --> 00:55:27,419
where you show that you share
the guy's intense passion for something

1053
00:55:27,522 --> 00:55:29,456
that, really, you don't have
the slightest interest in.

1054
00:55:30,224 --> 00:55:32,283
Okay, look, I don't know
what you heard, but...

1055
00:55:32,393 --> 00:55:33,621
Ace told me everything.

1056
00:55:35,062 --> 00:55:37,087
Don't worry, I haven't ratted you out.

1057
00:55:38,399 --> 00:55:40,799
Truth is, I support your overall goal.

1058
00:55:42,103 --> 00:55:45,072
But if you really want to help him,
and I think you do,

1059
00:55:45,173 --> 00:55:46,697
you have to have all the facts.

1060
00:55:46,941 --> 00:55:49,501
Starting with the fact
that Jeffrey's not Tripp's nephew.

1061
00:55:51,179 --> 00:55:52,237
You ever heard of Amy?

1062
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,448
Amy is... He's Amy's son.

1063
00:55:54,615 --> 00:55:57,846
Amy is Tripp's first love,
and she died six years ago.

1064
00:55:58,052 --> 00:55:59,747
He never told you that, did he?

1065
00:56:02,823 --> 00:56:04,154
Oh, my God!

1066
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:08,859
I am the worst person in the world.

1067
00:56:09,564 --> 00:56:12,624
Oh, hey, you're home. Great.

1068
00:56:12,833 --> 00:56:16,701
I have to break up with Tripp.
I'm terminating my contract, and...

1069
00:56:17,338 --> 00:56:18,327
I can't do it.

1070
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:20,802
What happened in here?

1071
00:56:20,908 --> 00:56:22,341
Nothing. I tripped.

1072
00:56:23,010 --> 00:56:24,409
Go on with your story.

1073
00:56:24,512 --> 00:56:26,207
Oh. Well,

1074
00:56:28,316 --> 00:56:29,943
Tripp was engaged.

1075
00:56:32,053 --> 00:56:34,419
-Okay.
-And you know Jeffrey, his nephew?

1076
00:56:34,755 --> 00:56:38,020
He's not his nephew.
He's not related to him at all.

1077
00:56:38,159 --> 00:56:41,185
Jeffrey is a boy whose mother
was gonna marry Tripp,

1078
00:56:42,463 --> 00:56:43,691
and she died.

1079
00:56:45,499 --> 00:56:46,966
That's so sad.

1080
00:56:47,068 --> 00:56:48,501
God, I know.

1081
00:56:49,237 --> 00:56:50,829
Who gives a shit?

1082
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:53,136
I beg your pardon?

1083
00:56:53,241 --> 00:56:56,074
Seriously. I've never heard you
talk this way about a client before.

1084
00:56:56,177 --> 00:56:57,667
I don't know why you're whining
about this one.

1085
00:56:57,778 --> 00:56:58,904
Because...

1086
00:56:59,714 --> 00:57:02,239
He's been through an actual tragedy!

1087
00:57:04,619 --> 00:57:08,055
This is about Tripp not being
an appropriate client.

1088
00:57:08,155 --> 00:57:10,089
It's an ethical problem.

1089
00:57:12,927 --> 00:57:14,019
Who's that?

1090
00:57:16,597 --> 00:57:17,655
What?

1091
00:57:18,899 --> 00:57:19,957
In...

1092
00:57:21,168 --> 00:57:22,692
Oh! In...

1093
00:57:22,803 --> 00:57:24,031
That's Phillip.

1094
00:57:24,805 --> 00:57:26,170
Who's Phillip?

1095
00:57:27,541 --> 00:57:28,974
Phillip's...

1096
00:57:29,143 --> 00:57:30,371
I... Oh!

1097
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:35,148
Hi, ladies.

1098
00:57:35,483 --> 00:57:37,280
Did I say that you could come out?

1099
00:57:40,254 --> 00:57:42,415
Well, well, well, well, well.

1100
00:57:43,457 --> 00:57:44,754
He's nice.

1101
00:57:44,859 --> 00:57:46,224
That's nice.

1102
00:57:47,495 --> 00:57:49,793
Look, I don't see
why it's so complicated.

1103
00:57:49,897 --> 00:57:52,127
You like Tripp. Tell Tripp you like him.

1104
00:57:53,901 --> 00:57:55,198
<i>I gotta tell you something.</i>

1105
00:57:55,569 --> 00:57:57,161
I told Paula about Amy.

1106
00:57:58,272 --> 00:58:00,502
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What? What...

1107
00:58:00,608 --> 00:58:01,666
Why?

1108
00:58:01,776 --> 00:58:03,038
You were never going to.

1109
00:58:03,344 --> 00:58:04,971
You never even say her name.

1110
00:58:05,279 --> 00:58:08,009
Amy was his ex-fiance.
She died about six years ago.

1111
00:58:08,115 --> 00:58:10,913
To lose love is greatest pain of all.

1112
00:58:11,018 --> 00:58:12,007
That's right.

1113
00:58:12,119 --> 00:58:13,984
It's okay to cry. We'll turn around.

1114
00:58:14,088 --> 00:58:15,578
I'm fine, guys.

1115
00:58:18,025 --> 00:58:19,083
Dude.

1116
00:58:20,728 --> 00:58:23,856
You had no right to do that, man.
That's my life.

1117
00:58:24,031 --> 00:58:25,521
You're right, you're right.
And, normally...

1118
00:58:25,633 --> 00:58:27,498
I believe everybody
needs to walk their own path,

1119
00:58:27,601 --> 00:58:30,297
but just you're not walking yours. Okay?

1120
00:58:30,404 --> 00:58:32,429
You're sitting near the path, on a rock.

1121
00:58:33,441 --> 00:58:35,966
This was the only thing I could do,
given the circumstances.

1122
00:58:36,077 --> 00:58:37,544
Circumstances?

1123
00:58:38,412 --> 00:58:40,380
Brings up the other thing I gotta tell you.

1124
00:58:41,048 --> 00:58:43,278
I feel a little bit bad
because I kind of implied to Paula

1125
00:58:43,384 --> 00:58:44,612
that I wouldn't say anything, but...

1126
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:46,710
Deception's a poison.
It's like margarine.

1127
00:58:46,821 --> 00:58:47,879
I can't have that in my body.

1128
00:58:47,988 --> 00:58:50,115
God damn it, Demo, get to the point.
Come on.

1129
00:58:51,425 --> 00:58:54,861
Your parents hired Paula to date you
so that you'd move out of their house.

1130
00:58:56,030 --> 00:58:57,759
Bullshit. What are you talking about?

1131
00:58:58,065 --> 00:59:00,056
They're paying her to be your girlfriend.

1132
00:59:00,167 --> 00:59:01,429
-Paula?
-Yeah.

1133
00:59:01,535 --> 00:59:04,333
But she's a professional interventionist.
It's her job.

1134
00:59:04,505 --> 00:59:05,472
You know?

1135
00:59:07,742 --> 00:59:10,836
You're telling me it's not real?

1136
00:59:10,945 --> 00:59:14,779
No. No, it's real! It's very real!

1137
00:59:14,882 --> 00:59:16,372
Okay, you're upset right now.

1138
00:59:16,484 --> 00:59:19,009
I want to encourage you to see past
that bottomless sense of betrayal.

1139
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,815
Focus on the future, okay?

1140
00:59:20,921 --> 00:59:22,388
'Cause I think you guys
could work things out.

1141
00:59:22,490 --> 00:59:24,958
I mean it.
I think you crazy kids have a shot.

1142
00:59:32,767 --> 00:59:35,031
So you came home
and he was cooking?

1143
00:59:35,136 --> 00:59:36,228
Yeah.

1144
00:59:36,637 --> 00:59:37,831
Strange.

1145
00:59:38,406 --> 00:59:40,203
-Hey, you know what?
-What?

1146
00:59:40,307 --> 00:59:42,741
-Smells good.
-I know!

1147
00:59:46,247 --> 00:59:47,236
Can you get that?

1148
00:59:52,219 --> 00:59:54,813
Hi. I didn't know that you guys
were gonna be here.

1149
00:59:54,922 --> 00:59:57,390
Listen, we didn't, either. Come on in.

1150
00:59:57,491 --> 00:59:58,515
Okay. Thank you.

1151
00:59:58,626 --> 01:00:00,025
Tripp's in the kitchen.

1152
01:00:02,596 --> 01:00:04,086
That does, too.

1153
01:00:04,765 --> 01:00:05,732
All right!

1154
01:00:09,637 --> 01:00:10,604
Tripp?

1155
01:00:11,172 --> 01:00:13,470
Hey, there's my girl. Come here, you.

1156
01:00:15,109 --> 01:00:16,770
Hey, what's going on?

1157
01:00:16,877 --> 01:00:18,742
Got a little family dinner.

1158
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:22,281
All the people that I care about the most

1159
01:00:22,383 --> 01:00:24,783
together in one room. Good times.

1160
01:00:24,885 --> 01:00:26,250
Hey.

1161
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:28,251
Listen, can we talk?

1162
01:00:28,355 --> 01:00:30,414
Absolutely. There's gonna be
plenty of time to talk over dinner.

1163
01:00:30,524 --> 01:00:32,389
But right now, I'm cooking.

1164
01:00:33,127 --> 01:00:35,357
Mom, Pop, you want some more <i>vino?</i>

1165
01:00:37,164 --> 01:00:38,358
That's good, that's good.

1166
01:00:38,466 --> 01:00:40,331
Oh, just a little bit more
for the y-o-u, babe.

1167
01:00:40,734 --> 01:00:42,065
Tripp, I don't know what to say.

1168
01:00:42,169 --> 01:00:44,330
Oh, Mom, will you knock that talk off?

1169
01:00:46,407 --> 01:00:48,637
I made this beautiful dinner tonight

1170
01:00:49,109 --> 01:00:52,408
to say thank you
to the people that I love the most.

1171
01:00:52,513 --> 01:00:54,276
All of you.

1172
01:00:54,448 --> 01:00:55,745
I'm truly blessed.

1173
01:00:55,850 --> 01:00:58,614
Mom. Pop. Sweetie.

1174
01:00:58,986 --> 01:01:01,181
-That's good, Son.
-Cheers.

1175
01:01:03,757 --> 01:01:04,917
Dig in!

1176
01:01:10,264 --> 01:01:12,858
Hang on. Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
I'm too excited.

1177
01:01:12,967 --> 01:01:14,730
I have an announcement to make here.

1178
01:01:15,936 --> 01:01:16,903
Okay.

1179
01:01:22,076 --> 01:01:23,373
Paula,

1180
01:01:23,944 --> 01:01:25,411
the last couple of weeks

1181
01:01:26,981 --> 01:01:29,313
that I've spent with you have been

1182
01:01:30,451 --> 01:01:31,782
amazing,

1183
01:01:32,553 --> 01:01:33,884
surprising,

1184
01:01:34,889 --> 01:01:36,049
joyful,

1185
01:01:37,057 --> 01:01:38,388
surprising.

1186
01:01:39,827 --> 01:01:43,228
I can honestly say that, because of you,

1187
01:01:45,299 --> 01:01:49,326
I've experienced emotions
that I didn't even know I had.

1188
01:01:53,374 --> 01:01:54,966
So call me crazy,

1189
01:01:55,676 --> 01:01:56,700
but I think

1190
01:01:57,077 --> 01:01:58,442
we should move in together.

1191
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:01,145
That's my boy!

1192
01:02:02,182 --> 01:02:03,706
You okay, baby? Want some water?

1193
01:02:04,919 --> 01:02:05,886
Thank you.

1194
01:02:06,353 --> 01:02:08,184
That's wonderful news.

1195
01:02:08,522 --> 01:02:10,285
I am so proud of you, Son.

1196
01:02:10,391 --> 01:02:12,689
Right? And the thing is, Mom, Dad,

1197
01:02:12,793 --> 01:02:16,524
I've lived upstairs since I was three,
and it's been great.

1198
01:02:17,731 --> 01:02:21,189
All right? You two are the best parents
that a boy could ever ask for.

1199
01:02:21,302 --> 01:02:24,999
I mean, I can only hope that I'm going
to be able to give my kids,

1200
01:02:28,642 --> 01:02:29,870
our kids,

1201
01:02:30,544 --> 01:02:34,173
half of the love, the respect,

1202
01:02:34,381 --> 01:02:36,372
the understanding, the support,

1203
01:02:36,483 --> 01:02:38,348
that you two have given me.

1204
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:42,321
I guess what I'm saying is,
it is time for Tripp

1205
01:02:43,891 --> 01:02:45,381
to spread his wings.

1206
01:02:50,898 --> 01:02:51,865
Wow.

1207
01:02:53,133 --> 01:02:54,100
Well...

1208
01:02:55,202 --> 01:02:58,069
Well, this is very unexpected.

1209
01:02:58,172 --> 01:02:59,571
So here's the plan, all right?

1210
01:02:59,673 --> 01:03:01,368
We're going to blow out
the east wall of my bedroom,

1211
01:03:01,475 --> 01:03:02,772
enlarge the bathroom,

1212
01:03:02,876 --> 01:03:07,210
and basically turn the entire upstairs
into a secondary master suite

1213
01:03:07,381 --> 01:03:09,372
so there's room for the both of us,

1214
01:03:10,117 --> 01:03:11,141
and the both of you,

1215
01:03:11,251 --> 01:03:12,218
under the same roof.

1216
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:13,479
What do you say?

1217
01:03:21,462 --> 01:03:24,693
I'm not understanding.
You want Paula to move in here?

1218
01:03:24,798 --> 01:03:26,959
Yes! It's the perfect solution.

1219
01:03:27,067 --> 01:03:29,934
Mom, Dad, you like her.
Paula, you like them.

1220
01:03:30,037 --> 01:03:34,064
We're all gonna be right here together
under one roof, a big happy family.

1221
01:03:34,174 --> 01:03:36,142
I'm telling you,
I'm getting really excited about this.

1222
01:03:36,243 --> 01:03:37,437
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait just a second.

1223
01:03:37,578 --> 01:03:39,045
Take a deep breath here and...

1224
01:03:39,146 --> 01:03:41,376
Tripp, Tripp, I just think
that we should probably talk about this.

1225
01:03:41,482 --> 01:03:43,245
Just 'cause it's a big idea, and...

1226
01:03:43,350 --> 01:03:45,614
Honey, I've given this
a lot of thought, all right? It'll work!

1227
01:03:46,086 --> 01:03:49,180
And the best part about it is, Mom, Dad,

1228
01:03:51,025 --> 01:03:53,960
you won't have to keep paying Paula
to be my girlfriend.

1229
01:04:00,134 --> 01:04:02,329
What, did I say something wrong?
Come on.

1230
01:04:03,570 --> 01:04:05,197
You're all getting what you wanted.

1231
01:04:05,906 --> 01:04:09,171
Paula, you don't have to pretend
to like me anymore.

1232
01:04:09,343 --> 01:04:12,710
And, Mom, Dad,
you wanted me out of the house.

1233
01:04:16,550 --> 01:04:17,744
I'm out.

1234
01:04:31,632 --> 01:04:34,430
Tripp, wait! Tripp!

1235
01:04:35,569 --> 01:04:36,536
Tripp!

1236
01:04:38,772 --> 01:04:40,205
I don't want to hear it.

1237
01:04:40,674 --> 01:04:42,005
Come on, Tripp.

1238
01:04:43,877 --> 01:04:46,437
Please, you don't understand.

1239
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:48,238
You're right. Now hold on.

1240
01:04:49,650 --> 01:04:51,709
I don't know what your daily rate is,

1241
01:04:51,819 --> 01:04:54,845
but that's everything
I've got in my wallet. There's $300.

1242
01:04:54,955 --> 01:04:56,422
Oh, come on, Tripp!

1243
01:04:56,523 --> 01:04:59,822
Which should be good for tonight,
especially since we didn't have sex.

1244
01:04:59,927 --> 01:05:02,327
Please, Tripp, let me just explain to you.

1245
01:05:02,429 --> 01:05:04,226
Get the fuck out of my car.

1246
01:05:11,905 --> 01:05:13,270
Oh, God.

1247
01:05:54,948 --> 01:05:56,813
So your parents gave her money.

1248
01:05:56,917 --> 01:05:59,010
My grandparents
give my baby-sitter money

1249
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:00,143
and I still like her.

1250
01:06:00,254 --> 01:06:02,984
Well, good for you, Captain.
Hey, can we talk about something else?

1251
01:06:03,090 --> 01:06:05,581
Fine. The 32 is nice.

1252
01:06:08,362 --> 01:06:10,762
But I think I see myself more in a 37.

1253
01:06:11,298 --> 01:06:12,458
What do you think?

1254
01:06:12,766 --> 01:06:14,199
Don't buy a boat, dude.

1255
01:06:15,302 --> 01:06:17,395
I love...boats.

1256
01:06:17,704 --> 01:06:19,899
No, you don't love boats.

1257
01:06:20,107 --> 01:06:22,905
You love the idea of a boat.

1258
01:06:23,477 --> 01:06:25,138
But the reality is,

1259
01:06:25,279 --> 01:06:28,646
they're just a drain on your time,
your wallet, and your emotions.

1260
01:06:29,216 --> 01:06:31,207
And in the end,
she will break your heart.

1261
01:06:32,152 --> 01:06:34,416
<i>You see, because no matter how much</i>
<i>you care for her,</i>

1262
01:06:34,521 --> 01:06:35,749
<i>she's got no feelings for you.</i>

1263
01:06:35,856 --> 01:06:38,324
<i>I mean, look at her, she's a boat.</i>
<i>She's wood.</i>

1264
01:06:40,093 --> 01:06:42,459
<i>So forget buying a boat.</i>
<i>You want to feel pain?</i>

1265
01:06:43,030 --> 01:06:45,260
You're better off
slamming your hand in a car door.

1266
01:06:46,967 --> 01:06:50,403
You see, that's the stuff that screams,
"I live with my mother."

1267
01:06:50,804 --> 01:06:52,465
-What?
-I mean it.

1268
01:06:52,573 --> 01:06:54,234
I'm telling you as a friend.

1269
01:06:56,543 --> 01:06:58,670
You bring that weak stuff
to the playground,

1270
01:06:58,779 --> 01:07:00,246
you won't last 10 minutes.

1271
01:07:01,982 --> 01:07:04,644
Thank you very much for giving me
a few minutes of your time.

1272
01:07:05,252 --> 01:07:08,312
-Why don't you sit down?
-No, no, no, thank you.

1273
01:07:08,422 --> 01:07:10,287
No, I just want to give you this.

1274
01:07:13,126 --> 01:07:14,889
-What is it?
-It's your money.

1275
01:07:15,329 --> 01:07:17,559
I'm returning it.
I know it doesn't fix anything.

1276
01:07:17,664 --> 01:07:19,325
I know that nothing can,

1277
01:07:20,467 --> 01:07:23,630
but given the circumstances,
I don't feel good keeping it, so...

1278
01:07:24,738 --> 01:07:25,966
Really, please take it.

1279
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:27,507
Okay.

1280
01:07:29,610 --> 01:07:30,577
What?

1281
01:07:30,677 --> 01:07:32,736
This has never happened before.
I want you to know that.

1282
01:07:32,846 --> 01:07:35,406
He seemed like an open-and-shut case.

1283
01:07:36,383 --> 01:07:39,113
I guess I was overly confident.

1284
01:07:39,386 --> 01:07:40,819
I don't know. And he...

1285
01:07:41,722 --> 01:07:44,282
He won't return
any of my phone calls, and I...

1286
01:07:45,993 --> 01:07:48,257
I keep replaying it over and over
in my mind. I just...

1287
01:07:48,362 --> 01:07:50,057
I don't know where I...

1288
01:07:52,933 --> 01:07:54,696
You're in love with our son.

1289
01:08:06,446 --> 01:08:08,676
Hey, come on, we're gonna go
rock climbing. Get in the car.

1290
01:08:08,782 --> 01:08:09,749
No.

1291
01:08:10,317 --> 01:08:12,148
You've been moping around here
for two weeks.

1292
01:08:12,252 --> 01:08:13,446
Come on, get in.

1293
01:08:13,954 --> 01:08:14,943
Nah.

1294
01:08:15,055 --> 01:08:17,148
Tripp! Come on, it's unlocked.

1295
01:08:17,257 --> 01:08:19,555
It wants you to get in.
Come on. Get in the car, Tripp.

1296
01:08:20,761 --> 01:08:22,490
Isn't this great, guys?

1297
01:08:22,896 --> 01:08:24,625
How you doing up there, Tripp?

1298
01:08:24,731 --> 01:08:27,029
-You feeling it?
-Yeah, baby.

1299
01:08:27,134 --> 01:08:28,863
This is a nice rock.

1300
01:08:29,403 --> 01:08:31,371
-Aren't you glad we came?
-Yeah.

1301
01:08:31,471 --> 01:08:34,304
Doing good. This is having fun.
Aren't we?

1302
01:08:38,278 --> 01:08:40,269
You guys want any carrots?

1303
01:08:41,114 --> 01:08:43,275
Tripp, you should call Paula.

1304
01:08:44,051 --> 01:08:46,519
-She wants to see you.
-That's enough, Demo!

1305
01:08:48,555 --> 01:08:50,045
A little slack, Ace!

1306
01:08:51,358 --> 01:08:52,484
Here you go.

1307
01:08:55,095 --> 01:08:56,323
Belay on.

1308
01:09:02,469 --> 01:09:04,096
You know, she's hurting, too.

1309
01:09:05,172 --> 01:09:06,469
She's miserable, Tripp.

1310
01:09:09,776 --> 01:09:11,073
Let it go, guys.

1311
01:09:14,081 --> 01:09:15,105
Ace!

1312
01:09:30,130 --> 01:09:31,119
My bad.

1313
01:09:31,298 --> 01:09:34,495
<i>I once knew a specialist used to send</i>
<i>some of his patients to me.</i>

1314
01:09:34,868 --> 01:09:36,392
<i>All they needed was a little push.</i>

1315
01:09:36,937 --> 01:09:39,599
Look, Paula, this has to stop.

1316
01:09:40,007 --> 01:09:40,996
You don't sleep,

1317
01:09:41,108 --> 01:09:43,668
and the only thing I've seen you eat
in the last three days

1318
01:09:43,777 --> 01:09:45,335
is a bag of Mint Milanos.

1319
01:09:45,579 --> 01:09:48,412
Well, don't worry about me.

1320
01:09:49,216 --> 01:09:51,150
I'll be gone in a couple of weeks.

1321
01:09:51,918 --> 01:09:53,351
What? Where are you going?

1322
01:09:53,453 --> 01:09:55,182
I'm moving back to Colorado.

1323
01:09:56,323 --> 01:09:58,348
What are you gonna do in Colorado?

1324
01:09:58,458 --> 01:10:01,359
-I haven't figured it out.
-Well, that's stupid.

1325
01:10:01,461 --> 01:10:03,725
I mean, what are you gonna do
until you figure it out?

1326
01:10:03,830 --> 01:10:05,161
Move in with your parents?

1327
01:10:07,534 --> 01:10:10,799
Oh. That's so wrong.

1328
01:10:10,904 --> 01:10:15,170
Don't judge me, okay?
I mean, you, of all people?

1329
01:10:15,542 --> 01:10:16,839
Pretty funny.

1330
01:10:16,943 --> 01:10:19,411
You know what?
I'm the one who's in a real relationship!

1331
01:10:19,513 --> 01:10:21,413
You're the one who lies for a living!

1332
01:10:21,515 --> 01:10:24,279
You think you're so smart,
but you don't know anything!

1333
01:10:24,384 --> 01:10:26,477
Did you really think
you'd never get caught?

1334
01:10:26,586 --> 01:10:28,144
You could've been happy
but you blew it.

1335
01:10:28,255 --> 01:10:30,280
Now you try to act
like it's everyone else's fault,

1336
01:10:30,390 --> 01:10:31,379
but it's all you.

1337
01:10:31,491 --> 01:10:33,459
And now you think
Colorado's the answer?

1338
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:35,926
You know, Kit,
just because you finally convinced a guy

1339
01:10:36,029 --> 01:10:37,758
to sleep with you more than once

1340
01:10:38,198 --> 01:10:41,065
doesn't make you
an expert on relationships.

1341
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:50,475
-Tripp!
-Tripp!

1342
01:10:50,977 --> 01:10:52,035
Come on up, buddy.

1343
01:10:52,145 --> 01:10:53,976
-Tripp!
-Tripp?

1344
01:10:55,182 --> 01:10:56,513
Hey! Hey, buddy!

1345
01:10:56,650 --> 01:10:58,618
Come up. There you are.

1346
01:10:59,719 --> 01:11:00,845
-Is he...
-Hey.

1347
01:11:01,955 --> 01:11:03,786
Hey, guys.

1348
01:11:05,926 --> 01:11:07,416
You were bitten by a chuckwalla.

1349
01:11:07,861 --> 01:11:10,022
That shouldn't have happened.
It's a reptile of peace.

1350
01:11:10,163 --> 01:11:11,323
I have a theory.

1351
01:11:11,431 --> 01:11:14,059
This isn't the first time
that nature's lashed out at you like this.

1352
01:11:14,568 --> 01:11:17,036
I believe it's because your life

1353
01:11:17,137 --> 01:11:19,605
is fundamentally at odds
with the natural world.

1354
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:22,170
-Huh?
-Therefore, nature rejects you.

1355
01:11:24,744 --> 01:11:26,234
You're insane.

1356
01:11:26,780 --> 01:11:27,906
Can I have some water?

1357
01:11:28,014 --> 01:11:29,345
-Yeah.
-Right here.

1358
01:11:29,449 --> 01:11:31,883
-Here we go.
-Okay, okay, easy.

1359
01:11:32,285 --> 01:11:33,809
Look, I've been all over the world.

1360
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:36,184
You're the only human to my knowledge
who's been bitten by a dolphin,

1361
01:11:36,289 --> 01:11:38,757
a chipmunk, and a vegetarian lizard
in the same calendar year.

1362
01:11:40,127 --> 01:11:41,992
And you haven't been
a very good friend, either.

1363
01:11:42,195 --> 01:11:44,220
Do you realize that not once
have you asked me

1364
01:11:44,331 --> 01:11:45,821
about my relationship with Kit?

1365
01:11:49,369 --> 01:11:52,770
Dude, did you just drop me
from a 40-foot cliff?

1366
01:11:54,141 --> 01:11:56,234
I mean, you want
to talk about a friend, man,

1367
01:11:56,343 --> 01:11:57,537
you went behind my back,

1368
01:11:57,644 --> 01:11:59,908
and blackmailed your way
into getting your girlfriend.

1369
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,411
He's right.

1370
01:12:02,983 --> 01:12:05,213
-I'm sorry I dropped you from a cliff.
-It's okay.

1371
01:12:05,385 --> 01:12:08,252
Granted, he used you,
but not out of malice.

1372
01:12:08,355 --> 01:12:10,346
Look at him.
How many chances is he gonna get?

1373
01:12:10,457 --> 01:12:12,118
He saw a chance for love, Tripp,
and he took it.

1374
01:12:12,225 --> 01:12:14,216
Which is exactly
what we wanted for you.

1375
01:12:14,928 --> 01:12:16,088
Am I getting advice

1376
01:12:16,196 --> 01:12:18,664
from my two loser buddies
who still live at home?

1377
01:12:18,765 --> 01:12:20,357
Actually, I own my home.

1378
01:12:21,067 --> 01:12:22,591
-What?
-No, you don't.

1379
01:12:22,702 --> 01:12:24,260
I bought it a couple of years ago
from my mom.

1380
01:12:24,371 --> 01:12:25,429
That way, she has a place to live

1381
01:12:25,539 --> 01:12:27,006
and I don't get nailed
on the inheritance tax.

1382
01:12:27,107 --> 01:12:28,233
-Smart.
-Wow.

1383
01:12:28,375 --> 01:12:31,674
And Demo, here, has chosen
the life of a wanderer.

1384
01:12:31,845 --> 01:12:34,006
I mean, sure,
he technically still lives at home.

1385
01:12:34,114 --> 01:12:36,139
-Yeah.
-But his permanent address

1386
01:12:36,249 --> 01:12:37,443
is in his heart.

1387
01:12:38,151 --> 01:12:39,345
He's a bum.

1388
01:12:41,388 --> 01:12:45,324
I think what we're trying to say
is that the two of us are happy

1389
01:12:45,659 --> 01:12:47,126
and we're perfectly functional.

1390
01:12:47,427 --> 01:12:51,090
And you, Tripp, are not.

1391
01:13:05,412 --> 01:13:06,436
Mom?

1392
01:13:08,481 --> 01:13:09,505
Pop?

1393
01:13:25,732 --> 01:13:26,994
Yeah, baby!

1394
01:13:27,667 --> 01:13:28,929
Hey, Pop.

1395
01:13:30,904 --> 01:13:32,701
Hey! Tripp. What are you doing here?

1396
01:13:32,806 --> 01:13:36,139
Just came by to get some stuff.
What are you doing?

1397
01:13:36,610 --> 01:13:37,804
Feeding my fish.

1398
01:13:37,911 --> 01:13:40,311
Yeah. I see that.

1399
01:13:42,749 --> 01:13:45,513
You're naked. In my room.

1400
01:13:46,386 --> 01:13:49,219
Well, this is my Naked Room.

1401
01:13:50,257 --> 01:13:51,622
I mean, it's my house.

1402
01:13:51,891 --> 01:13:55,759
A man ought to be able to do whatever
he wants to do in his own house.

1403
01:13:56,429 --> 01:13:58,158
Wore a suit for 40 years.

1404
01:13:58,598 --> 01:14:00,589
-So now we got 40 years of...
-No suit.

1405
01:14:00,700 --> 01:14:01,928
No suit.

1406
01:14:03,169 --> 01:14:04,431
All right.

1407
01:14:05,171 --> 01:14:06,695
I'm gonna let you get back
to feeding your fish.

1408
01:14:06,806 --> 01:14:08,706
Thanks for stopping by.

1409
01:14:10,477 --> 01:14:14,675
Hey, Pop? Seriously, man,
was it that bad having me around?

1410
01:14:16,783 --> 01:14:19,843
Don't be an idiot, Son.
Your mom and I love you.

1411
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:21,953
Then why didn't you
just say something?

1412
01:14:22,055 --> 01:14:24,956
All you had to do was tell me.

1413
01:14:25,558 --> 01:14:28,493
You needed time
after Amy had passed away, Tripp.

1414
01:14:28,595 --> 01:14:31,155
And who knows how much time is right?

1415
01:14:31,564 --> 01:14:33,930
Is it two years? Is it six years?

1416
01:14:34,034 --> 01:14:37,265
Then I ran into Bud and Bev Nestor,
and they'd worked with Paula.

1417
01:14:37,504 --> 01:14:40,268
And their son is really happy now.

1418
01:14:40,373 --> 01:14:44,571
Lives in Seattle, I think.
Married an Indian girl.

1419
01:14:45,178 --> 01:14:48,841
Anyway, it just seemed easier.

1420
01:14:48,982 --> 01:14:50,142
Easier.

1421
01:14:53,353 --> 01:14:54,445
All right.

1422
01:14:56,389 --> 01:14:57,651
Hey, man,

1423
01:14:59,326 --> 01:15:01,351
I gotta say, I like
what you've done with the place.

1424
01:15:01,461 --> 01:15:04,362
Yeah, I like it. I love you, Son.

1425
01:15:04,464 --> 01:15:06,193
I love you, too. Shake on it.

1426
01:15:07,233 --> 01:15:09,531
Why don't you get back
to scaring those fish, buddy? Huh?

1427
01:15:09,636 --> 01:15:10,603
All right.

1428
01:15:11,137 --> 01:15:12,764
Come back anytime, Son.

1429
01:15:12,872 --> 01:15:14,499
Come here. Bucket. Bucket.

1430
01:15:19,979 --> 01:15:21,844
-Hey, Mom.
-Tripp.

1431
01:15:22,282 --> 01:15:23,806
You see what's going on upstairs?

1432
01:15:24,017 --> 01:15:26,212
Pop's naked, in his Naked Room.

1433
01:15:26,319 --> 01:15:28,184
I know. He's always wanted one.

1434
01:15:28,288 --> 01:15:29,846
He tried to take over the dining room

1435
01:15:29,956 --> 01:15:32,857
until I convinced him
that the first floor was problematic.

1436
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:36,853
-You okay?
-Yeah.

1437
01:15:37,297 --> 01:15:38,764
Just came by to pick up some clothes.

1438
01:15:42,802 --> 01:15:44,099
I'm sorry.

1439
01:15:46,406 --> 01:15:47,998
It was a lousy thing to do.

1440
01:15:51,578 --> 01:15:53,546
You know, when we first met Paula,

1441
01:15:55,081 --> 01:15:56,639
when we hired her, I...

1442
01:15:57,250 --> 01:15:58,877
I didn't want you to go.

1443
01:15:59,886 --> 01:16:02,411
For years, I've been dreading
the day you'd leave

1444
01:16:02,522 --> 01:16:06,014
and I always thought
it was 'cause I'd miss you so much.

1445
01:16:06,259 --> 01:16:09,228
Then I realized that
that was only part of it.

1446
01:16:09,396 --> 01:16:11,489
I didn't want you to leave because

1447
01:16:12,465 --> 01:16:15,400
being alone with your father
freaks the living shit out of me.

1448
01:16:15,869 --> 01:16:17,769
-What?
-I'm terrified, Tripp!

1449
01:16:17,937 --> 01:16:19,996
And it's not just about the Naked Room.

1450
01:16:20,407 --> 01:16:23,467
Since your father retired, I just...

1451
01:16:24,444 --> 01:16:26,139
I'm used to having you here.

1452
01:16:27,013 --> 01:16:29,243
Like a buffer, you know?
Somebody to talk to

1453
01:16:29,349 --> 01:16:31,817
when your father's all
moody and sullen, and...

1454
01:16:33,253 --> 01:16:34,311
Now I'm...

1455
01:16:34,454 --> 01:16:37,287
We're just gonna have to
get to know each other all over again.

1456
01:16:38,324 --> 01:16:39,450
And...

1457
01:16:43,797 --> 01:16:44,855
What?

1458
01:16:48,668 --> 01:16:50,192
What if he doesn't like me?

1459
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:55,007
Hey.

1460
01:17:03,416 --> 01:17:04,940
You still love him, right?

1461
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:08,712
Against all odds.

1462
01:17:10,457 --> 01:17:12,049
Then you'll figure it out.

1463
01:17:16,696 --> 01:17:17,663
Come here.

1464
01:17:18,765 --> 01:17:20,392
Hey.

1465
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:29,164
You're gonna miss me.

1466
01:17:30,543 --> 01:17:31,532
That's true.

1467
01:17:31,978 --> 01:17:36,278
I called you all here together
because obviously we have a situation.

1468
01:17:36,382 --> 01:17:40,250
I know we all feel some responsibility,
but this isn't about blame,

1469
01:17:40,353 --> 01:17:42,548
it's about finding a solution.

1470
01:17:42,889 --> 01:17:44,982
Two people we love are hurting.

1471
01:17:45,091 --> 01:17:47,889
So let's put on our thinking caps.

1472
01:17:48,027 --> 01:17:51,019
Man, this shirt feels
like it weighs 100 pounds.

1473
01:17:51,130 --> 01:17:52,290
Albert!

1474
01:17:54,634 --> 01:17:56,158
Okay, how about this?

1475
01:17:56,769 --> 01:18:01,035
We send flowers to Paula from Tripp,

1476
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:05,668
and flowers to Tripp from Paula.

1477
01:18:07,714 --> 01:18:11,172
-Then what?
-Then they love each other.

1478
01:18:11,284 --> 01:18:12,683
Oh, Jesus Christ!

1479
01:18:12,785 --> 01:18:14,252
Because of the flowers!

1480
01:18:14,988 --> 01:18:16,285
Thank you, Phillip.

1481
01:18:16,389 --> 01:18:20,689
Now, let's all try to come up with a plan
that's not so idiotic.

1482
01:18:24,631 --> 01:18:25,598
Hey.

1483
01:18:27,667 --> 01:18:28,827
Listen,

1484
01:18:31,137 --> 01:18:35,506
I went through all the CDs,
but if you end up with some of mine

1485
01:18:35,608 --> 01:18:37,576
or I end up with some of yours,

1486
01:18:37,677 --> 01:18:39,508
let's just call it even, okay?

1487
01:18:40,079 --> 01:18:41,410
Okay, sure.

1488
01:18:42,015 --> 01:18:42,982
Okay.

1489
01:18:45,084 --> 01:18:46,210
I hate this.

1490
01:18:46,319 --> 01:18:47,616
I know. I do, too.

1491
01:18:47,887 --> 01:18:48,854
So...

1492
01:18:50,490 --> 01:18:54,654
So let's just get it over with, then.

1493
01:18:58,765 --> 01:19:00,665
Okay, look, I know I'm a girl

1494
01:19:00,767 --> 01:19:02,758
and I'm supposed to be better
at this emotional crap

1495
01:19:02,869 --> 01:19:04,928
but I'm not, so I'm just gonna say it.

1496
01:19:05,038 --> 01:19:09,338
I'm sorry that I pointed out to you
that you fell in love with a client

1497
01:19:09,442 --> 01:19:11,876
and that made you go crazy
and turn into a total bitch.

1498
01:19:15,381 --> 01:19:16,348
Wow.

1499
01:19:18,251 --> 01:19:21,015
That must've been really hard
for you to say.

1500
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:25,079
I thought it was going to be, but I just
kind of breezed right through it.

1501
01:19:27,327 --> 01:19:28,760
Well, thanks.

1502
01:19:29,796 --> 01:19:33,254
And I'm sorry that I pointed out

1503
01:19:33,366 --> 01:19:35,630
that you haven't had a real relationship
for the last five years

1504
01:19:35,735 --> 01:19:37,600
because I'm the only person
who can tolerate

1505
01:19:37,704 --> 01:19:39,604
your bizarre and violent mood swings.

1506
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:42,871
Oh, thank you!

1507
01:19:46,446 --> 01:19:47,435
Goodbye.

1508
01:19:47,547 --> 01:19:48,775
I'm gonna miss you.

1509
01:19:48,881 --> 01:19:50,246
Yeah, I'm going to miss you, too.

1510
01:19:50,850 --> 01:19:53,011
Can I at least give you
a ride to the airport?

1511
01:19:53,119 --> 01:19:54,143
Sure.

1512
01:19:54,287 --> 01:19:56,084
<i>On the way, let's stop at Phillip's,</i>

1513
01:19:56,189 --> 01:19:59,022
<i>so I can give you back</i>
<i>that sweater of yours that you lost.</i>

1514
01:20:08,201 --> 01:20:10,499
Wow! This is fantastic!

1515
01:20:10,603 --> 01:20:12,434
-Yeah, it's pretty great.
-Wow.

1516
01:20:12,538 --> 01:20:14,733
At this point, we're just waiting
for his mom to kick it

1517
01:20:14,841 --> 01:20:16,433
so we can move upstairs.

1518
01:20:16,643 --> 01:20:18,201
That is a lovely sentiment.

1519
01:20:18,311 --> 01:20:19,437
Go, go, go, go!

1520
01:20:20,246 --> 01:20:21,213
Hey!

1521
01:20:21,614 --> 01:20:23,605
Kit! What are you...

1522
01:20:24,851 --> 01:20:26,284
Oh, hi, fellas.

1523
01:20:27,487 --> 01:20:28,647
-Look in the closet.
-Hey, just look

1524
01:20:28,755 --> 01:20:29,813
-Yeah.
-...right in the closet.

1525
01:20:29,922 --> 01:20:30,946
Why?

1526
01:20:31,057 --> 01:20:32,217
-Huh?
-Go, go, go, go, go!

1527
01:20:32,325 --> 01:20:34,520
Wait! What are you guys doing?

1528
01:20:57,216 --> 01:21:00,117
Sorry. I tried to do it fast
so it wouldn't hurt.

1529
01:21:00,219 --> 01:21:02,119
You were concerned about hurting me?

1530
01:21:02,922 --> 01:21:04,480
That's a refreshing change of pace.

1531
01:21:04,657 --> 01:21:07,182
Listen, I say there's no downside.
They already hate each other.

1532
01:21:07,293 --> 01:21:08,282
I wonder how they're doing.

1533
01:21:08,394 --> 01:21:09,691
Whoa, whoa, hold on just a second.

1534
01:21:09,796 --> 01:21:11,627
Let's check, shall we?

1535
01:21:14,534 --> 01:21:16,331
Okay, watch this.

1536
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:24,036
Is this how it's gonna be?
'Cause your note says,

1537
01:21:24,143 --> 01:21:26,202
"Hi, we need to talk."

1538
01:21:26,312 --> 01:21:27,802
Yeah, I wrote that.

1539
01:21:27,980 --> 01:21:32,007
Right after I tied myself to the chair
and covered my mouth with duct tape.

1540
01:21:32,118 --> 01:21:34,382
-So you don't want to talk.
-To you?

1541
01:21:36,055 --> 01:21:37,352
I'll pass.

1542
01:21:40,727 --> 01:21:42,854
I can't see her face.
Do you have any other angles?

1543
01:21:42,962 --> 01:21:44,554
Of course I have angles. Check it out.

1544
01:21:45,364 --> 01:21:49,801
I installed 27 cameras that cover
every inch of the apartment.

1545
01:21:50,470 --> 01:21:52,404
-Were these up last night?
-Yeah.

1546
01:21:52,872 --> 01:21:53,839
No.

1547
01:21:55,241 --> 01:21:56,606
I helped tie the knots.

1548
01:21:56,709 --> 01:21:58,540
The one on his feet
is called an Anchor Hitch.

1549
01:21:58,644 --> 01:22:00,111
I could get out of those ropes.

1550
01:22:00,213 --> 01:22:01,680
You can't get out
of your barbecue apron.

1551
01:22:04,517 --> 01:22:07,111
This is ridiculous,
not to mention juvenile.

1552
01:22:07,220 --> 01:22:10,087
We can't just sit here
and not say anything.

1553
01:22:12,492 --> 01:22:14,585
All right, fine. I'll start.

1554
01:22:15,795 --> 01:22:17,888
I think you're being a jackass.

1555
01:22:21,234 --> 01:22:25,170
I think those pants make you look fat,
but in a sexy...

1556
01:22:26,706 --> 01:22:28,833
-I don't get it.
-I told you this was a stupid idea.

1557
01:22:29,408 --> 01:22:30,375
Hey.

1558
01:22:31,544 --> 01:22:32,806
We should have done the flowers.

1559
01:22:32,912 --> 01:22:35,938
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
She's going to say something.

1560
01:22:37,884 --> 01:22:39,442
Tripp, I apologize.

1561
01:22:40,253 --> 01:22:43,711
My job was manipulative and deceitful.

1562
01:22:43,823 --> 01:22:47,782
But the second that I found out
about Amy, I was gonna end it.

1563
01:22:48,795 --> 01:22:51,787
But I never got the chance,
because you found out first.

1564
01:23:01,908 --> 01:23:02,642
Sorry. Sorry.

1565
01:23:02,642 --> 01:23:04,610
Sorry. Sorry.

1566
01:23:10,049 --> 01:23:11,448
Apology accepted.

1567
01:23:11,851 --> 01:23:12,943
Thank you.

1568
01:23:14,687 --> 01:23:17,588
Come on.
You don't want to say anything?

1569
01:23:17,690 --> 01:23:20,284
-You know, I do have a question.
-Absolutely. Anything.

1570
01:23:21,194 --> 01:23:23,685
How many others were there?
Before me.

1571
01:23:24,030 --> 01:23:26,794
I'm just asking, 'cause, you know,
maybe we could all get together.

1572
01:23:26,899 --> 01:23:28,389
You know, form a support group.

1573
01:23:28,501 --> 01:23:30,833
And if there already is a group,
I'm curious,

1574
01:23:30,937 --> 01:23:33,030
is it a small group,
like a basketball team?

1575
01:23:33,139 --> 01:23:34,731
Or is it a big group,

1576
01:23:35,741 --> 01:23:36,969
like the Chinese?

1577
01:23:37,610 --> 01:23:39,168
Wow. Somebody's a little cranky today.

1578
01:23:39,278 --> 01:23:43,078
Tripp, your mother was still making you
pancakes for breakfast.

1579
01:23:43,182 --> 01:23:45,878
And it's not as if
I waltzed into your life unbidden.

1580
01:23:45,985 --> 01:23:47,850
Your parents called me.

1581
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:51,089
Your life was in
an extended stall pattern.

1582
01:23:51,190 --> 01:23:52,782
I wish I could talk to guys like that.

1583
01:23:52,892 --> 01:23:54,883
Well, it's easier when the guy is tied up.

1584
01:23:54,994 --> 01:23:58,225
No, I've talked to guys tied up before.

1585
01:24:00,833 --> 01:24:02,858
You want to talk about my life?
What about your life?

1586
01:24:03,002 --> 01:24:04,333
Hey, but maybe I shouldn't judge.

1587
01:24:04,437 --> 01:24:07,304
I'm sure there's some reason
that you turned out to be a soul-sucking,

1588
01:24:07,406 --> 01:24:09,601
Labrador-retriever-killing harpy.

1589
01:24:09,709 --> 01:24:11,802
I don't get it.
How does the dog fit into it?

1590
01:24:11,911 --> 01:24:13,310
-Good question.
-Can you turn it up?

1591
01:24:13,646 --> 01:24:16,615
Well, they're laptop speakers, so...

1592
01:24:19,051 --> 01:24:20,279
Unless...

1593
01:24:21,988 --> 01:24:23,785
I was doing fine before you showed up.

1594
01:24:24,390 --> 01:24:25,618
All right? I was having fun.

1595
01:24:25,725 --> 01:24:27,352
Oh, and I just ruined everything!

1596
01:24:27,827 --> 01:24:29,920
So is that why you tried
to break up with me?

1597
01:24:30,029 --> 01:24:32,725
Or actually, you didn't.
You just trotted out your parents

1598
01:24:32,832 --> 01:24:35,130
so that I would have
to break up with you.

1599
01:24:35,234 --> 01:24:37,862
-Oh, snap!
-That got his attention!

1600
01:24:37,970 --> 01:24:41,303
That's right, you call her on her shit,
she's gonna call you on yours!

1601
01:24:41,407 --> 01:24:44,570
What are you going to do, baby?
Are you gonna cry?

1602
01:24:45,511 --> 01:24:46,535
Sorry.

1603
01:24:47,413 --> 01:24:49,404
Why would you do that?

1604
01:24:51,217 --> 01:24:52,411
Because

1605
01:24:53,619 --> 01:24:55,109
you gave me "the look."

1606
01:24:55,221 --> 01:24:57,246
-Not "the look."
-Why are you bringing up "the look"?

1607
01:24:57,356 --> 01:24:58,345
What's "the look"?

1608
01:24:58,658 --> 01:25:03,220
The look that says, "Hey, I like you."

1609
01:25:03,729 --> 01:25:05,060
Oh, wow.

1610
01:25:06,999 --> 01:25:09,229
That must've been horrible for you.

1611
01:25:09,502 --> 01:25:10,594
Do I do "the look"?

1612
01:25:10,703 --> 01:25:11,692
Well, yeah.

1613
01:25:11,904 --> 01:25:12,871
Well, no.

1614
01:25:13,539 --> 01:25:15,234
I never meant to hurt you.

1615
01:25:18,978 --> 01:25:22,277
I believe that.
But what do I know about you?

1616
01:25:22,548 --> 01:25:26,951
I mean, the entire amount of time
we spent together was just a big scam.

1617
01:25:28,220 --> 01:25:32,919
I found a woman I cared about,
and she turned out to be a total fraud.

1618
01:25:36,329 --> 01:25:38,126
Do you have real feelings?

1619
01:25:38,831 --> 01:25:40,958
Of course I have real feelings.

1620
01:25:41,067 --> 01:25:43,501
-For what?
-For you!

1621
01:25:44,303 --> 01:25:46,328
And believe me, I did not want that,

1622
01:25:46,439 --> 01:25:49,135
because I had a good life before you.

1623
01:25:49,775 --> 01:25:52,835
Well, not good, but it was okay.

1624
01:25:54,146 --> 01:25:56,444
Well, it was empty, actually,

1625
01:25:56,549 --> 01:26:00,417
but at least I was blissfully unaware
of how miserable I was!

1626
01:26:00,519 --> 01:26:03,317
Whereas now, because of you,

1627
01:26:03,823 --> 01:26:05,950
I am acutely aware

1628
01:26:06,058 --> 01:26:09,323
of how completely
and totally unhappy I am!

1629
01:26:12,732 --> 01:26:14,063
Thank you for that.

1630
01:26:22,408 --> 01:26:26,003
I don't usually like reality TV shows,
but this is so emotional.

1631
01:26:26,645 --> 01:26:28,272
Are you crying?

1632
01:26:30,516 --> 01:26:31,505
Come on, Tripp.

1633
01:26:51,604 --> 01:26:52,662
He's moving.

1634
01:26:52,772 --> 01:26:54,364
He's rolling. Here we go.

1635
01:26:54,473 --> 01:26:55,997
He's making a move! All right!

1636
01:26:56,108 --> 01:26:57,871
He's moving his feet! He's rolling!

1637
01:26:57,977 --> 01:26:59,501
-Go! Go!
-Go!

1638
01:26:59,612 --> 01:27:01,204
Oh, my God! He could

1639
01:27:01,347 --> 01:27:02,871
-go all the way!
-Go all the way!

1640
01:27:02,982 --> 01:27:06,474
Don't do all the work, Son!
Make her meet you half way!

1641
01:27:13,492 --> 01:27:15,050
So what do we do now?

1642
01:27:20,533 --> 01:27:22,831
Actually, it's quite simple.

1643
01:27:22,935 --> 01:27:25,426
You just have to decide.

1644
01:27:26,172 --> 01:27:28,766
Do you want to spend
the rest of your life having fun?

1645
01:27:28,874 --> 01:27:30,899
Or do you want to spend it with me?

1646
01:27:32,044 --> 01:27:35,104
Shut up.
Not everything you say is perfect.

1647
01:27:35,214 --> 01:27:38,012
We can have a little bit of fun, can't we?

1648
01:27:47,126 --> 01:27:48,093
Right on, man!

1649
01:27:48,961 --> 01:27:49,928
All right!

1650
01:27:50,930 --> 01:27:51,897
Yeah!

1651
01:28:00,606 --> 01:28:01,664
Hallelujah!

1652
01:28:05,344 --> 01:28:07,141
Show's over. You don't need to see that.

1653
01:28:07,246 --> 01:28:09,373
Come on, let's you and I
go outside, huh?

1654
01:28:09,482 --> 01:28:11,541
Play some football.
I'll show you how to throw it deep.

1655
01:28:11,650 --> 01:28:13,982
After, I'll show you
how to ice your shoulder down.

1656
01:28:24,830 --> 01:28:26,161
Give you a hand?

1657
01:28:26,265 --> 01:28:29,200
You just take it easy.
I got everything under control.

1658
01:28:29,335 --> 01:28:31,667
Hey, what's the champagne about?

1659
01:28:31,804 --> 01:28:33,066
It's Thursday.

1660
01:28:38,410 --> 01:28:39,468
Thank you.

1661
01:28:41,147 --> 01:28:42,341
You're welcome.

1662
01:28:42,915 --> 01:28:43,904
Cheers.

1663
01:28:50,156 --> 01:28:53,125
All right, Captain,
where are we heading?

1664
01:28:56,695 --> 01:28:58,560
There's a lighthouse!
Can we go over there?

1665
01:28:59,031 --> 01:29:00,965
Sure. You're driving.

1666
01:29:07,773 --> 01:29:10,071
Tripp! Jibe ho! God, I said it late!

1667
01:29:10,176 --> 01:29:11,302
I'm sorry!

1668
01:29:16,582 --> 01:29:18,573
-Tripp!
-What happened to "jibe ho"?

1669
01:29:18,684 --> 01:29:20,481
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

1670
01:29:20,586 --> 01:29:23,419
Yeah. Just got the wind
knocked out of me.

1671
01:29:23,522 --> 01:29:25,456
Maybe a collapsed lung,
a bruised sternum.

1672
01:29:25,558 --> 01:29:27,389
Other than that, I'll survive.

1673
01:29:27,493 --> 01:29:30,189
I'm going to get you
a flotation device, okay?

1674
01:29:30,296 --> 01:29:31,263
Yeah.

1675
01:29:32,498 --> 01:29:33,726
Stay right there.

1676
01:29:34,099 --> 01:29:35,794
That's a good idea.

1677
01:29:38,137 --> 01:29:39,297
Oh, shit.

1678
01:29:40,973 --> 01:29:42,304
Oh, shit!

1679
01:29:42,608 --> 01:29:46,169
No biting! No biting. No bite, no bite.
No, no, no, no...

1680
01:29:54,119 --> 01:29:55,086
Good boy.

1681
01:29:55,588 --> 01:29:56,646
Come here, you.

1682
01:29:57,156 --> 01:29:59,147
Yeah. Yeah.

1683
01:29:59,758 --> 01:30:01,316
That's it. Okay.

1684
01:30:01,427 --> 01:30:03,054
Here! I...

1685
01:30:03,929 --> 01:30:05,556
Oh, my God!

1686
01:30:05,664 --> 01:30:06,631
Yeah.

1687
01:30:07,466 --> 01:30:08,956
That's amazing.

1688
01:30:11,103 --> 01:30:13,401
What do you say, big man, huh?

1689
01:30:21,780 --> 01:30:25,181
Hey, still need this?

1690
01:30:28,254 --> 01:30:29,687
No, I'm good.

1691
01:30:32,791 --> 01:30:33,883
I'm real good.

1692
01:30:34,727 --> 01:30:35,694
Okay.

1693
01:30:58,884 --> 01:31:00,875
Honey, it's an Eastern Wood-Pewee.

1694
01:31:00,986 --> 01:31:01,975
Eastern Wood-Pewee?

1695
01:31:02,087 --> 01:31:04,214
You couldn't be more wrong
if you called it a Canadian goose.

1696
01:31:08,394 --> 01:31:10,191
I'll give you a Canadian goose.

1697
01:31:25,010 --> 01:31:26,068
Look!

1698
01:31:30,182 --> 01:31:31,672
He's so tame.

1699
01:31:31,784 --> 01:31:34,685
Yeah. See, once we accept the fact
that we're not separate from nature,

1700
01:31:34,787 --> 01:31:36,448
she welcomes us. And it's not with fear.

1701
01:31:36,555 --> 01:31:38,250
Right? Who do you love?

1702
01:31:43,028 --> 01:31:44,620
<i>Hit the road, Tripp</i>

1703
01:31:44,730 --> 01:31:46,163
-<i>And don't you come back</i>
-<i>And don't you come back</i>

1704
01:31:46,265 --> 01:31:49,428
-<i>...no more, no more, no more, no more</i>
-<i>...no more, no more, no more, no more</i>

1705
01:31:49,535 --> 01:31:51,093
-<i>Hit the road, Tripp</i>
-<i>Hit the road, Tripp</i>

1706

-<i>And don't you come back no more</i>

1707
01:31:54,473 --> 01:31:55,667

1708
