1
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,368
My country men,
our voice must be heard.

2
00:02:31,593 --> 00:02:34,174
Japan belongs to the people,
not the military.

3
00:02:34,395 --> 00:02:37,805
We must end the military occupation
Of Shanghai!

4
00:02:38,065 --> 00:02:40,363
Hey, look.
The Kokureeu Clan is coming.

5
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,636
Memorize this.

6
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,699
Point one...

7
00:02:56,881 --> 00:02:59,626
concerns the dispersion
of lubricants around the engine.

8
00:02:59,851 --> 00:03:03,740
Point two is the mechanics, the pistons
And the function of the carburetor.

9
00:03:04,021 --> 00:03:07,910
All the functions I have covered today
Will be included in the final exam.

10
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,537
That's all.

11
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:31,127
- What's going on here?
- Chinaman, get out!

12
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:39,105
You can't do this!

13
00:03:39,284 --> 00:03:41,583
Japan is only
for the Japanese!

14
00:03:41,787 --> 00:03:45,099
- Take your war somewhere else!
- What?

15
00:03:53,631 --> 00:03:57,008
- You've got no right to do this.
- Oh, yeah?

16
00:03:59,535 --> 00:04:02,792
Stop it! There was no reason
For you to push him like that.

17
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:06,076
What? I'll push who I want to.

18
00:04:06,275 --> 00:04:08,508
My uncle
will hear about you.

19
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,194
Then we'll see
just how tough you are.

20
00:04:13,247 --> 00:04:15,066
Idiot!

21
00:04:15,249 --> 00:04:19,498
All right. I couldn't care less
About you or your uncle.

22
00:04:19,787 --> 00:04:23,523
You've got till three
to get lost. One!

23
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,445
Two!

24
00:04:25,624 --> 00:04:27,345
Three!

25
00:04:27,526 --> 00:04:31,742
- Get him!

26
00:05:09,162 --> 00:05:10,982
Let me help!

27
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,890
M-Master Sensai.

28
00:05:20,072 --> 00:05:24,158
He's the Kokureeu Sensai,
and he's also my uncle.

29
00:05:24,442 --> 00:05:28,745
So, I hope you've learned something
from your visit to this class.

30
00:05:29,046 --> 00:05:33,382
Brutality, as I've taught you,
has never been the way to win a battle.

31
00:05:33,683 --> 00:05:37,355
Professor, I do apologize.

32
00:05:47,697 --> 00:05:51,008
Be still. You're lucky that
you weren't seriously hurt.

33
00:05:51,266 --> 00:05:54,044
- Aah!
- What happened?

34
00:05:54,269 --> 00:05:57,493
It was my fault.

35
00:05:57,739 --> 00:06:01,410
Oh! Is it really?

36
00:06:01,676 --> 00:06:03,299
Impressive.

37
00:06:03,477 --> 00:06:06,440
I am Funakoshi Fumio.
And you are?

38
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:14,666
Don't tell me that's the one
your father gave you?

39
00:06:14,954 --> 00:06:19,202
Oh, yes, it is. He paid a lot
for this pen. Now look at it.

40
00:06:19,491 --> 00:06:23,130
- What will we tell Daddy?
- Dear, let's not tell him anything.

41
00:06:23,395 --> 00:06:27,066
There's really no need
to make him angry.

42
00:06:27,331 --> 00:06:29,433
My students
will take care of it.

43
00:06:31,968 --> 00:06:36,217
Mitsuko, dear, here you are.
That's better.

44
00:06:36,505 --> 00:06:39,632
You're just as demanding
as your father, and just as stubborn.

45
00:06:39,876 --> 00:06:41,695
Young men don't like
stubborn women.

46
00:06:41,877 --> 00:06:44,045
Thank you, but I know
One young man that does.

47
00:06:44,246 --> 00:06:48,462
- Him?
- Sir. My name is Chen Zhen.

48
00:06:48,749 --> 00:06:51,462
- Chen Zhen from Jing Wu?
- Yes.

49
00:06:51,686 --> 00:06:54,267
- Who was your Master there?
- It was Master Hou.

50
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,910
Oh, no.

51
00:06:59,091 --> 00:07:01,259
What is it, Uncle?

52
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:06,373
I-- Last night
in the local newspaper--

53
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,403
The article said that
your Master was killed...

54
00:07:13,705 --> 00:07:15,524
in a match.

55
00:07:15,707 --> 00:07:18,485
He fought with
one of the Niguchi Clan...

56
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:20,649
to his death.

57
00:07:23,312 --> 00:07:25,132
I don't believe it!

58
00:07:27,382 --> 00:07:30,476
I am sorry.
I know you must be deeply hurt.

59
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,572
Excuse me, sir.

60
00:07:44,498 --> 00:07:47,624
Master Hou's death
is a very great loss.

61
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,783
Chen Zhen?
Where are you going?

62
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:56,849
To Shanghai.
Master Hou was like a father to me.

63
00:07:57,075 --> 00:08:00,070
It's because his killer was Japanese.
That's why you're so angry.

64
00:08:00,312 --> 00:08:03,983
Stop the occupation of China!
Free Shanghai!

65
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:33,904
Do you know just how badly I want
to come along with you on your journey?

66
00:08:37,211 --> 00:08:39,117
Chen Zhen!

67
00:08:39,314 --> 00:08:43,650
I'll wait for you.
You know I will.

68
00:08:43,951 --> 00:08:48,581
When the Japanese soldiers
are out of Shanghai, then I'll return.

69
00:08:48,888 --> 00:08:52,560
Our leaders can be
very hard to persuade, you know.

70
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:56,168
Then we'll be
extremely persuasive.

71
00:08:56,428 --> 00:08:59,107
We'll make your leaders
listen to us.

72
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:03,285
Chen Zhen, don't hate us all.

73
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,155
I don't hate.

74
00:09:07,604 --> 00:09:10,088
Mitsuko, it must be this way.

75
00:09:10,306 --> 00:09:12,245
I have no choice.

76
00:09:12,442 --> 00:09:15,057
Take care.

77
00:09:16,545 --> 00:09:19,029
Chen Zhen!

78
00:10:08,924 --> 00:10:12,018
Sorry, kids.
That's all I have.

79
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,842
Go away now.

80
00:10:15,062 --> 00:10:18,156
- I'm just a student.
- Money, please, sir.

81
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,874
I don't have
anything else for you.

82
00:10:22,135 --> 00:10:25,447
- Please, go and find someone else.
- Go on. Get out of here!

83
00:10:25,705 --> 00:10:27,938
- Ohayo.
- I am not Japanese.

84
00:10:28,141 --> 00:10:31,332
You're not?
Excuse me.

85
00:10:31,576 --> 00:10:33,809
Okay, right this way.

86
00:10:34,012 --> 00:10:36,495
- Where are you going?
- To Jing Wu.

87
00:10:36,715 --> 00:10:39,678
To Jing Wu,
the kung fu school?

88
00:10:39,917 --> 00:10:42,302
That's right.
I study kung fu.

89
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,265
- What's the matter?
- Where have you been?
Haven't you heard?

90
00:10:45,489 --> 00:10:48,615
You better find a new place
to learn kung fu.

91
00:10:48,858 --> 00:10:52,268
Since their number one Master died,
their reputation is in the gutter.

92
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:55,175
- Absurd. I'll find another rickshaw.
- Take it easy.

93
00:10:55,397 --> 00:10:57,217
I'll drive you there.

94
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:01,222
Just don't be surprised if the doors
are closed. Okay, here we go.

95
00:11:20,252 --> 00:11:22,965
You know,
the Master here was killed...

96
00:11:23,189 --> 00:11:25,291
and now the pupils
are leaving.

97
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:28,867
Hey, don't you know?
The Japanese want this place real bad.

98
00:11:29,127 --> 00:11:31,676
You hear?
Forget it.

99
00:11:31,895 --> 00:11:35,338
Chen Zhen!
What are you doing here?

100
00:11:35,598 --> 00:11:37,418
- Let me help.
- Thank you.

101
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,685
- Ah, so you're--
- Chen Zhen from Jing Wu.

102
00:11:41,971 --> 00:11:43,790
The best.

103
00:11:44,795 --> 00:11:47,344
Keep the change.

104
00:11:50,732 --> 00:11:54,043
You heard what I said!

105
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:10,937
Master Ngai,
this place is sacred to us.

106
00:12:11,181 --> 00:12:14,078
If you want to fight,
let's go outside.

107
00:13:09,323 --> 00:13:11,555
Master, are you all right?

108
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:14,601
A good fight.
Thank you, sir.

109
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:18,466
- For what? Target practice?
- Hey, understand something.

110
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:22,553
If you're looking for a fight
At Jing Wu, you are asking for trouble.

111
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,218
You or the Japanese.

112
00:13:25,434 --> 00:13:28,113
Huh.

113
00:13:32,306 --> 00:13:34,125
Is school out?

114
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:41,557
Welcome.
Glad you're back.

115
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,700
Uncle Nang.

116
00:13:44,882 --> 00:13:48,291
I was hoping to tell you about him
when school was over.

117
00:13:48,551 --> 00:13:51,263
How'd you hear?

118
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,371
A Japanese newspaper.

119
00:13:55,623 --> 00:13:58,684
They printed it
with pleasure!

120
00:13:58,924 --> 00:14:01,767
Well, pay your respects to him.

121
00:14:01,994 --> 00:14:03,932
Let's go.

122
00:14:12,334 --> 00:14:14,469
Wait a minute.
You can't.

123
00:14:14,669 --> 00:14:17,534
He shouldn't wear that.
He's not family.

124
00:14:20,007 --> 00:14:23,645
Uncle, Chen Zhen was raised as a son.
You know that.

125
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:26,904
He has the right,
same as you and me. Ah.

126
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,766
He should not have fought
that day.

127
00:14:35,985 --> 00:14:38,282
I knew something was wrong.

128
00:14:38,486 --> 00:14:40,588
I saw it.

129
00:14:40,789 --> 00:14:42,608
We all did.

130
00:14:46,692 --> 00:14:48,924
Go ahead, now.

131
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:17,922
What are you doing?
That's our symbol for acceptance.

132
00:15:18,148 --> 00:15:20,283
Hey, Uncle.

133
00:15:20,483 --> 00:15:22,814
Chen Zhen's right.

134
00:15:23,018 --> 00:15:25,218
Our enemies
have taken away our Master.

135
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,653
They control our leaders.

136
00:15:27,855 --> 00:15:32,104
So, there can no longer be acceptance.
They have proven that now.

137
00:15:48,903 --> 00:15:50,723
Where are you going?

138
00:15:50,904 --> 00:15:52,876
To the Niguchi.

139
00:15:53,073 --> 00:15:56,068
Chen Zhen, revenge is
against the law, you know.

140
00:15:56,309 --> 00:15:58,280
Well, then...
I'll break the law.

141
00:15:58,477 --> 00:16:00,329
- Chen Zhen! No.
- Chen Zhen!

142
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:05,424
Ting En, you know, you've been
there before. It's a fortress.

143
00:16:05,748 --> 00:16:08,330
They must have a hundred men.

144
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,652
- Don't forget that you're the Master.
- But, Uncle--

145
00:16:10,853 --> 00:16:12,857
Hey, that's enough.

146
00:16:13,054 --> 00:16:14,873
I'm responsible for you.

147
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:19,646
Cheung, Biu, take some men
and follow him.

148
00:16:19,892 --> 00:16:21,711
Yes, sir.

149
00:16:25,897 --> 00:16:28,194
- Sixth precinct. May I help you?
- Ah, that looks good.

150
00:16:28,397 --> 00:16:30,695
All right, go on.

151
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,416
Captain, for you.

152
00:16:33,635 --> 00:16:35,868
Ah, what now?

153
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,238
Captain speaking.

154
00:16:38,439 --> 00:16:40,258
Niguchi Arena?

155
00:16:42,575 --> 00:16:45,864
By himself?
Yes. Got it.

156
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:49,813
To the Japanese compound.

157
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,313
One! Two!

158
00:16:52,515 --> 00:16:55,925
Three! Four!

159
00:16:56,184 --> 00:16:58,068
- Idiot! Practice!
- Yes, sir.

160
00:16:58,253 --> 00:17:00,072
Dismissed.

161
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,878
Look! Look!

162
00:17:14,797 --> 00:17:17,792
Take your Chinese shoes
and get out of here!

163
00:17:18,033 --> 00:17:21,443
I am Chen Zhen.
Where is Akutagawa?

164
00:17:21,702 --> 00:17:25,079
Hey, you.
Niguchi owns this place. Go!

165
00:17:25,338 --> 00:17:28,148
I'm not going anywhere
till Akutagawa comes.

166
00:17:28,374 --> 00:17:31,217
What? Ooh, come on!

167
00:18:35,356 --> 00:18:37,621
Aah!

168
00:19:13,951 --> 00:19:16,696
Where is your Master now?

169
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,892
I want to see him.

170
00:19:27,594 --> 00:19:29,761
We shall challenge
each other...

171
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:32,227
openly and fairly.

172
00:19:32,431 --> 00:19:37,725
If one of us dies,
there will be no revenge.

173
00:19:51,211 --> 00:19:53,412
Master fought you
with the Hou Fist.

174
00:19:53,612 --> 00:19:55,616
It would be his wish
for me to do the same.

175
00:21:14,672 --> 00:21:18,114
He'd have beaten you
If he had been healthy.

176
00:21:42,524 --> 00:21:45,998
Only Japanese citizens
and those with special passes
are allowed to enter here.

177
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,231
Ah.

178
00:21:48,429 --> 00:21:50,945
You heard what he said.
Chen can't be in there.

179
00:21:51,164 --> 00:21:52,983
But I swear I saw him
go in there myself!.

180
00:21:53,165 --> 00:21:55,582
Yeah, so did I.
Hey, there he is!

181
00:21:55,801 --> 00:21:58,164
Tell us what happened?

182
00:21:58,369 --> 00:22:01,179
- You Japanese?
- Chinese.

183
00:22:10,411 --> 00:22:13,820
-Attention!

184
00:22:34,495 --> 00:22:37,490
- Is there a problem?
- No, sir.

185
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:40,028
Not at all.
General Fujita, sir.

186
00:22:40,232 --> 00:22:44,731
- Mr. Ambassador, it's nothing.
- Move it, now.

187
00:22:45,035 --> 00:22:47,365
Yes, sir.

188
00:22:50,774 --> 00:22:52,593
Company, march!

189
00:22:58,278 --> 00:23:01,273
- Did you beat him?
- I did.

190
00:23:01,514 --> 00:23:05,534
- Go tell Ting En to meet me
and the others at Master's grave.
- Right. I'll go.

191
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:08,180
- But it isn't finished yet.
- I know.

192
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:10,521
That's it. Keep it even.
A little higher.

193
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,822
Watch the back.
Watch the side. Up.

194
00:23:13,022 --> 00:23:14,842
- Come on. More.
- Steady.

195
00:23:15,023 --> 00:23:16,842
- A little more. No, down there.
- Careful.

196
00:23:21,562 --> 00:23:23,414
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

197
00:23:25,398 --> 00:23:28,295
Doctor, go ahead.

198
00:23:45,868 --> 00:23:48,547
I'm a doctor,
not a pathologist.

199
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:51,035
Let me.

200
00:23:51,238 --> 00:23:55,507
- What doyou need?
- I need the liver ifyou
want me to check for poison.

201
00:23:57,708 --> 00:24:00,125
- Stop them!
- Huh?

202
00:24:00,343 --> 00:24:03,272
- What are they doing here?
- Testing. Why?

203
00:24:03,511 --> 00:24:05,612
- Testing for what?
- What do you think?

204
00:24:05,813 --> 00:24:09,385
- Chen Zhen believes the Japanese
might have poisoned him.
- What?

205
00:24:09,649 --> 00:24:14,245
- Chen Zhen, I can't believe
that he was poisoned.
- Why not?

206
00:24:14,551 --> 00:24:18,189
If I beat Akutagawa easily,
he would have done it also.

207
00:24:18,453 --> 00:24:21,992
Captain, do you think
that he was poisoned?

208
00:24:22,255 --> 00:24:25,413
The first time he got hit really hard,
did you notice how weak he became?

209
00:24:25,658 --> 00:24:29,132
All right. But do we
have to do this in public?

210
00:24:29,393 --> 00:24:31,212
- Here.
- What?

211
00:24:31,394 --> 00:24:35,184
Take this. You'll have to kill me
If you want me to stop this.

212
00:24:35,462 --> 00:24:37,727
I want to know the truth.

213
00:24:37,932 --> 00:24:40,447
Master would want us to know
who took his life.

214
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:42,485
Hey! Uh, uh--

215
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:07,241
Thorazide.
A most deadly poison.

216
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,810
- What?
- He was poisoned.

217
00:25:10,015 --> 00:25:13,391
Uh, but who could've done this?

218
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:15,469
It's up to you
to find that out.

219
00:25:15,652 --> 00:25:20,378
- Now give us a hand. You can see
the Master needs our help.
- Sure.

220
00:25:20,689 --> 00:25:23,204
- All right. Let's go.
- Come on, you guys.

221
00:25:23,423 --> 00:25:26,320
I knew it. Akutagawa couldn't
have beaten him so easily.

222
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,791
That's right.
Now we have to find out who did it.

223
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:33,263
You know, it's a good thing
Chen was here. Otherwise,
we wouldn't even know.

224
00:25:35,581 --> 00:25:38,326
It makes no sense
that someone would do this.

225
00:25:38,549 --> 00:25:41,925
Maybe somebody slipped him poison
while he was outside the school.

226
00:25:42,184 --> 00:25:45,473
Impossible. He stayed inside
the gates here for one whole month.

227
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,617
- We were right beside him.
- That's right.

228
00:25:48,855 --> 00:25:51,697
Then somebody from Jing Wu
must've done it.

229
00:25:54,458 --> 00:25:56,723
- Ah, Xiao Wei.
- Huh?

230
00:25:56,925 --> 00:25:59,790
You cooked for Master sometimes,
didn't you?

231
00:26:00,028 --> 00:26:03,088
- Uh-huh. So what?
- Mm-mmm.

232
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:05,714
Uncle Nang, you don't think
it was Xiao Wei?

233
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:07,749
No.

234
00:26:07,932 --> 00:26:11,722
But it could be someone else
from the kitchen.

235
00:26:12,001 --> 00:26:13,820
I do!

236
00:26:14,002 --> 00:26:18,217
So now you want to start
slinging accusations? Accusing me?

237
00:26:20,106 --> 00:26:24,255
Cheung, go search my kitchen to see
If there's any poisons in there.

238
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:27,950
- Uncle, don't be so angry.
- Stay out of this! Go on!

239
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:31,400
Just see for yourself if
I have anything poisonous in there.

240
00:26:31,645 --> 00:26:34,422
Go on! Take a good look!

241
00:26:34,647 --> 00:26:36,553
Uncle, this is crazy.

242
00:26:36,748 --> 00:26:39,329
Damn right,
suspecting people like me!

243
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,880
Do you think
it might be the cook?

244
00:26:42,085 --> 00:26:46,234
I don't think so. The cook has been
around a long time. He loved my father.

245
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,459
Hey, now, no one
is blaming you for it.

246
00:26:48,655 --> 00:26:52,162
Why not? I'm responsible
for all the food that we eat!

247
00:26:52,423 --> 00:26:56,888
All the food that is served.
Every bowl of rice on this table.

248
00:26:57,193 --> 00:27:00,319
So why don't you accuse me directly,
face-to-face?

249
00:27:00,561 --> 00:27:03,785
-Just a minute.
- All right, that's enough. Let's eat.

250
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:06,447
Chen Zhen, the food
could be poisoned.

251
00:27:06,665 --> 00:27:09,027
Yes, it could be.
That's true.

252
00:27:09,233 --> 00:27:13,219
Since we all eat what Master ate,
why aren't we all dead? Huh?

253
00:27:13,502 --> 00:27:17,008
This is true. What do you
have to say about this, huh?

254
00:27:17,271 --> 00:27:19,852
- Accusing me.
- Sit down. Eat with us.

255
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:23,513
All right. By all means,
let's enjoy the food.

256
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:26,965
- It is safe to eat.
- Yeah, go on.

257
00:27:29,578 --> 00:27:33,183
You know,
I wanna go see Dr. Smith.

258
00:27:33,445 --> 00:27:37,051
I wanna know exactly
how Master was poisoned.

259
00:27:37,315 --> 00:27:40,985
- Then what?
- Then we'll know who did it.

260
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:44,179
Uh-huh.

261
00:27:51,822 --> 00:27:54,664
- What's he doing?
- It's new.

262
00:28:00,862 --> 00:28:03,159
Did he learn it in Japan?

263
00:28:03,362 --> 00:28:05,627
- What is it?
- Good!

264
00:28:05,831 --> 00:28:08,989
I don't know.
In Japan.

265
00:28:10,667 --> 00:28:13,346
Good.

266
00:28:15,571 --> 00:28:18,054
Master Chen, if you're through
warming up, let's do some sparring.

267
00:28:18,271 --> 00:28:20,090
- Yeah, let's go. Come on.
- All right!

268
00:28:20,272 --> 00:28:21,611
- Okay, yeah.
- Let's go.

269
00:28:40,683 --> 00:28:42,981
Power, precision.

270
00:28:43,185 --> 00:28:45,221
And don't forget about speed.

271
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:48,197
If you practice every day
with these things in mind...

272
00:28:48,422 --> 00:28:51,711
then you'll begin to develop
a fighting mode, see?

273
00:28:51,957 --> 00:28:56,106
What I'm trying to say is,
it's instinctive.

274
00:28:56,392 --> 00:28:59,518
All of these things
will allow us to take a hit.

275
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,276
But what about
attacking the opponent first?

276
00:29:02,496 --> 00:29:05,338
Let's say you attack an opponent
with a strong defense.

277
00:29:05,563 --> 00:29:09,299
What happens? Bang! He hits you.
Now what? Have a strategy.

278
00:29:09,566 --> 00:29:11,799
Sister, they want
to enroll here.

279
00:29:12,001 --> 00:29:14,266
Uh-huh. There's so much talk
of Master Chen's ability.

280
00:29:14,469 --> 00:29:16,353
Yeah. We want to study
with him, okay?

281
00:29:16,537 --> 00:29:20,620
Students here must learn
from Ting En. His style has
as much power as Chen Zhen's.

282
00:29:20,906 --> 00:29:23,803
What's that?

283
00:29:24,041 --> 00:29:26,339
- Four leg form.
- It's too unstable.

284
00:29:26,542 --> 00:29:30,049
- Try to kick. Go on, kick.
- Yeah, right.

285
00:29:31,512 --> 00:29:34,354
Now, try this.
Put your weight here.

286
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:37,890
- It's very simple. There's strength.
- All right, you've got it.

287
00:29:38,148 --> 00:29:41,687
-Japanese style.
- Yeah, sure, go on. Show us.

288
00:29:41,951 --> 00:29:44,151
- Okay.

289
00:29:44,352 --> 00:29:47,413
- Here, bring it over.
- All right, get set.

290
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:56,967
- Amazing.
- See what I mean?

291
00:29:57,226 --> 00:29:59,132
- Great! You're great!
- Now you try it.

292
00:30:14,268 --> 00:30:16,087
Ting En?

293
00:30:20,172 --> 00:30:23,166
- What is it?
- Where are you going?

294
00:30:23,407 --> 00:30:27,230
- It's late.
- Mmm. Don't go yet.

295
00:30:27,509 --> 00:30:30,221
I have to.
I'm the Master.

296
00:30:30,444 --> 00:30:32,676
If you'd let me move in
with you at Jing Wu...

297
00:30:32,879 --> 00:30:37,126
you wouldn't ever have to
go anywhere, would you?

298
00:30:37,415 --> 00:30:40,758
I know, but you can't live there.

299
00:30:41,017 --> 00:30:43,946
Ooh, you promised me...

300
00:30:44,185 --> 00:30:46,515
that you'd tell them
about us soon.

301
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:51,184
So, will you? Hmm?

302
00:30:52,295 --> 00:30:55,039
- At the right time.
- Mmm.

303
00:30:59,345 --> 00:31:02,154
I want to know everything
they're doing.

304
00:31:08,048 --> 00:31:11,522
Oh! You're spying
on our own people!

305
00:31:11,783 --> 00:31:14,560
There will always be traitors
who will try to go against us.

306
00:31:21,553 --> 00:31:23,371
Sorry.

307
00:31:23,554 --> 00:31:26,646
- I'm late.
- So you're here.

308
00:31:26,889 --> 00:31:30,231
I thought you'd be too tired,
or even too embarrassed.

309
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:33,006
I don't know why you came.
No one wants you around here.

310
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:39,718
I just wanted to know
about the autopsy.

311
00:31:42,695 --> 00:31:47,867
The Jing Wu Master,
Master Hou, was he poisoned?

312
00:31:48,196 --> 00:31:50,331
All of you,
you can leave now.

313
00:31:56,534 --> 00:31:59,974
What? It's something
they can't hear?

314
00:32:00,236 --> 00:32:02,565
Huh?

315
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:06,537
You poisoned
The Jing Wu Master!

316
00:32:06,805 --> 00:32:10,790
The Chinese Resistance
was led by their Master.

317
00:32:11,073 --> 00:32:13,173
We knew that without him...

318
00:32:13,373 --> 00:32:16,781
the Resistance would be
quickly annihilated.

319
00:32:17,042 --> 00:32:21,670
We were depending on you, my friend,
to destroy the Fist of Legend.

320
00:32:21,977 --> 00:32:25,352
You couldn't.
You'd have failed.

321
00:32:25,612 --> 00:32:29,216
Therefore,
we did it ourselves.

322
00:32:29,479 --> 00:32:31,297
Poisoners!

323
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,516
But you must admit...

324
00:32:33,714 --> 00:32:38,560
-it gets the job done.
- You have no conscience,
but I am a samurai.

325
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:45,774
I thought we would do battle
according to our honor!

326
00:32:46,118 --> 00:32:49,243
You made him sick
with your poison.

327
00:32:49,486 --> 00:32:51,653
You are not worthy
Of the samurai spirit!

328
00:32:51,853 --> 00:32:54,183
Hah!

329
00:33:00,091 --> 00:33:02,736
- Mmm.
- Ooh!

330
00:33:02,958 --> 00:33:05,734
Let me tell you
about samurai spirit.

331
00:33:05,959 --> 00:33:09,116
It has nothing to do with honor,
but survival...

332
00:33:09,361 --> 00:33:11,844
and the total domination
of our enemies.

333
00:33:13,997 --> 00:33:15,140
It's good, but then--
Watch.

334
00:33:15,297 --> 00:33:17,780
- That's it.
- Here. I'll show you
the right way to do it.

335
00:33:17,998 --> 00:33:19,849
Now watch this.

336
00:33:20,032 --> 00:33:21,883
Uncle, according to
the doctor's report...

337
00:33:22,067 --> 00:33:24,299
Master was poisoned with a drug
that affected his lungs.

338
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,765
- See, it's easy.
- That's right.

339
00:33:26,967 --> 00:33:31,627
He would have found it
impossible to breathe at all.

340
00:33:33,336 --> 00:33:36,232
Doyou still think
someone from Jing Wu did it?

341
00:33:39,739 --> 00:33:42,700
Chen Zhen, why are you here?

342
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:46,249
Uncle Nang,
what are you saying?

343
00:33:46,508 --> 00:33:51,103
For the last two days,
all of the students here have
done nothing but admire you.

344
00:33:52,477 --> 00:33:54,296
You see that?

345
00:33:56,779 --> 00:34:00,350
How do you think
Ting En feels?

346
00:34:00,613 --> 00:34:02,813
About what?

347
00:34:03,014 --> 00:34:05,660
Everything that
you've been teaching...

348
00:34:05,881 --> 00:34:09,648
goes against
what Ting En has taught.

349
00:34:09,917 --> 00:34:11,735
Chen Zhen...

350
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:17,541
you do realize
that Ting En...

351
00:34:17,786 --> 00:34:20,563
is still the only Master
at this school.

352
00:34:24,988 --> 00:34:27,797
Keep it in mind.

353
00:34:39,394 --> 00:34:42,072
- Master Chen, are you going jogging?
- That's right.

354
00:34:42,295 --> 00:34:44,114
At this hour?

355
00:34:49,898 --> 00:34:52,446
- Master Chen! Hey, slow down.
- Yeah?

356
00:34:52,666 --> 00:34:56,368
I brought all my friends.
Look, they all want to run with you.

357
00:34:56,633 --> 00:34:58,734
- Let's go.

358
00:34:58,935 --> 00:35:00,754
I don't believe this.

359
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:08,319
That's what I heard, anyway.

360
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:12,857
What's it say?

361
00:35:14,373 --> 00:35:17,530
Akutagawa!
He's dead!

362
00:35:25,144 --> 00:35:28,073
Stop! Don't do this.
Violence is no solution.

363
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,814
General?

364
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:35,757
Go!

365
00:35:52,488 --> 00:35:55,232
- Good morning, Master.
- Mmm.

366
00:35:59,723 --> 00:36:02,020
You've been gone
the whole night.

367
00:36:04,625 --> 00:36:07,466
- Chen Zhen?
- He's gone out running.

368
00:36:09,026 --> 00:36:12,183
If you see him, let me know.

369
00:36:21,998 --> 00:36:25,569
They're here!
The Japanese are here!

370
00:36:25,833 --> 00:36:27,684
Over there.

371
00:36:27,867 --> 00:36:29,490
- It's the Japanese.
- I see.

372
00:36:33,102 --> 00:36:36,836
- Lin, go and get the police.
Hurry up now.
- Right.

373
00:36:42,005 --> 00:36:45,098
- What do you want?
- Chen Zhen. Hand him over.

374
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:49,261
Chen Zhen? Impossible.

375
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:53,047
He might be...
Out beating someone.

376
00:36:53,309 --> 00:36:55,193
A karate master or a samurai.

377
00:36:55,377 --> 00:36:57,511
Quiet!

378
00:36:57,711 --> 00:36:59,976
You will hand him over to me
to be punished...

379
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:02,824
for the murder of Akutagawa.

380
00:37:03,045 --> 00:37:06,301
That's not possible.
You know he didn't do it.

381
00:37:06,547 --> 00:37:10,979
So you say. Give him to me
and I'll prove it. Or let's fight!

382
00:37:11,283 --> 00:37:14,408
That's why you came here?
Draw your weapons.

383
00:37:15,451 --> 00:37:17,585
Close it!

384
00:37:36,491 --> 00:37:38,756
Aah!

385
00:37:56,633 --> 00:37:58,451
Help protect the shrine!

386
00:39:00,923 --> 00:39:03,852
- Arrest him!
- You are not in command.

387
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:12,482
Police!

388
00:39:14,928 --> 00:39:17,345
Hold your fire.
Hold your fire.

389
00:39:19,796 --> 00:39:21,897
Sabers.

390
00:39:24,121 --> 00:39:27,627
- You're Niguchi students. Go home!
- But why? Send them to jail.

391
00:39:27,888 --> 00:39:30,849
Then I have to arrest you.
Is that what you want?

392
00:39:31,089 --> 00:39:33,866
We won't go...
till you give us Chen.

393
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:36,061
Show me some respect.

394
00:39:36,257 --> 00:39:39,099
Bullshit!

395
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,086
- Chen!
- Huh?

396
00:39:46,828 --> 00:39:48,711
Nobody move.

397
00:39:51,095 --> 00:39:53,959
Yeah?
You will shoot me ifI move?

398
00:39:54,197 --> 00:39:57,866
Oh, not me.
But my pistol might misfire.

399
00:39:58,131 --> 00:40:02,084
Put down your weapons.
Arrest Chen.

400
00:40:02,365 --> 00:40:04,183
- Go!
- Why are you arresting him?

401
00:40:04,366 --> 00:40:06,249
We want to question him
in connection with the killing.

402
00:40:06,433 --> 00:40:09,111
- Hey, why me? I didn't--
- Let's go!

403
00:40:09,334 --> 00:40:11,153
- Wait! Wait!
- Move! Move!

404
00:40:11,334 --> 00:40:14,046
Go! Go!
Get out!

405
00:40:14,268 --> 00:40:17,393
Go back to Japan!
We'll see who the murderer is!

406
00:40:34,142 --> 00:40:36,722
Don't worry.
It'll be okay. You'll see.

407
00:40:36,942 --> 00:40:39,077
Hey, everybody,
listen to me.

408
00:40:39,276 --> 00:40:42,586
The captain is in charge,
so how can we lose, huh?

409
00:40:44,978 --> 00:40:47,014
Hey, what are you doing here?

410
00:40:47,212 --> 00:40:50,521
- I'm sorry. The judge--
He's so unreasonable.
- Huh?

411
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,598
I'm not on the case anymore.

412
00:40:52,781 --> 00:40:55,644
- But wait! What about Chen?
- Uh, I have to go.

413
00:40:55,881 --> 00:40:58,559
No, wait!
Hey, hey!

414
00:41:02,684 --> 00:41:06,059
Order! The Court is told...

415
00:41:06,318 --> 00:41:09,758
that the prosecution
will present four witnesses.

416
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:13,816
Your Honor, that is correct.

417
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,883
Each of them witnessed
the defendant commit the murder.

418
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:20,213
And where did these
so-called witnesses come from?

419
00:41:20,455 --> 00:41:22,970
Defendant had a knife!
And he stabbed Master Akutagawa...

420
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:26,597
-right through the heart,
and ran away before I could stop him.
- He was unreliable.

421
00:41:26,858 --> 00:41:28,828
- I recognize his face.
- Are you sure?

422
00:41:29,024 --> 00:41:31,353
It was him.
I'm certain.

423
00:41:31,558 --> 00:41:34,585
I recognized him clearly.

424
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:38,081
- Tell me. How many fingers do you see?
- Um, nine?

425
00:41:39,394 --> 00:41:42,105
Uh, wait a minute. Six?

426
00:41:44,329 --> 00:41:48,510
- Um, you moved your hand.
Can you come closer?
- No.

427
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:52,847
- This proves we're right.
These witnesses are lying.
- What a story!

428
00:41:56,365 --> 00:41:59,294
I was at Jing Wu
working with Biu Shin.

429
00:41:59,533 --> 00:42:01,732
Your Honor, Biu Shin's testimony...

430
00:42:01,934 --> 00:42:05,243
or that of any other Jing Wu students
cannot be trusted here.

431
00:42:05,502 --> 00:42:07,767
- Liar!

432
00:42:07,969 --> 00:42:10,353
Silence! Order!

433
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:13,379
Sir, the witness
Has just arrived.

434
00:42:14,705 --> 00:42:18,145
Your Honor, I'd like
to call a witness now.

435
00:42:18,405 --> 00:42:22,619
- Your Honor, Chinese testimony
cannot be trusted.
- The witness is from Japan.

436
00:42:26,074 --> 00:42:29,776
- You should allow it.
- Mm, okay.

437
00:42:49,681 --> 00:42:52,610
Now, miss,
please identify yourself.

438
00:42:52,849 --> 00:42:54,950
My name is Mitsuko Yamada.

439
00:42:55,149 --> 00:42:58,720
I live in Kyoto, where my father
is Minister of Education.

440
00:42:58,984 --> 00:43:03,677
Miss Yamada, you heard the
suspect say he was atJing Wu
at the time of the murder.

441
00:43:03,985 --> 00:43:07,327
- Do you agree with that testimony?
- I do not agree.

442
00:43:10,687 --> 00:43:14,160
I was-- We went
to a hotel together.

443
00:43:14,422 --> 00:43:17,318
- We spent the night.
- You and Chen Zhen?

444
00:43:17,556 --> 00:43:19,146
Yes.

445
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:23,008
What is she trying to say?

446
00:43:26,425 --> 00:43:29,713
Isn't it possible
that after you fell asleep...

447
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:34,010
- Chen Zhen could've left?
- No, that's not possible.

448
00:43:34,294 --> 00:43:38,628
No. You see, we didn't ever actually
go to sleep that night.

449
00:43:38,929 --> 00:43:43,077
- Then what were you doing
if you weren't sleeping?
- We--

450
00:43:43,363 --> 00:43:47,250
Chen Zhen and I are in love.

451
00:43:49,765 --> 00:43:52,792
- Hey, what does she mean?
- Don't know. You?

452
00:43:53,033 --> 00:43:56,158
- She meant they were
fooling around together.
- Really?

453
00:43:56,401 --> 00:43:58,372
- With a Japanese girl?
- That's right.

454
00:44:03,236 --> 00:44:07,537
I find these proceedings ridiculous,
besides being a waste of my time.

455
00:44:07,837 --> 00:44:09,688
- Case dismissed.

456
00:44:11,005 --> 00:44:12,824
Congratulations.

457
00:44:13,006 --> 00:44:14,825
Let's go.

458
00:44:19,141 --> 00:44:22,646
Pathetic fools.
This isn't over yet.

459
00:44:31,011 --> 00:44:32,830
Why did you lie?

460
00:44:33,012 --> 00:44:37,281
I did it to save you.
Now we'll be together.

461
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:53,894
Not from my kitchen!
She can starve for all I care!

462
00:44:57,019 --> 00:45:00,656
We sent you to Japan
to go to school, huh?

463
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:04,459
Not to fall in love
with a Japanese woman.

464
00:45:04,721 --> 00:45:06,985
What do you suppose
the Master would say?

465
00:45:09,256 --> 00:45:11,075
Here at Jing Wu...

466
00:45:12,157 --> 00:45:15,826
we have been greatly dishonored
by the Japanese.

467
00:45:15,941 --> 00:45:17,759
Chen Zhen...

468
00:45:17,942 --> 00:45:20,010
you are part of Jing Wu.

469
00:45:20,209 --> 00:45:23,236
You must give up all ties
with the Japanese.

470
00:45:23,477 --> 00:45:26,569
Chen Zhen, tell me.
Have I ever once dishonored you?

471
00:45:26,812 --> 00:45:28,597
No, you haven't.

472
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:33,310
Uh, Chen Zhen,
now that's a foolish mistake.

473
00:45:33,614 --> 00:45:37,120
Finish school,
and then find a wife.

474
00:45:37,381 --> 00:45:40,474
Better still,
find a Chinese wife.

475
00:45:40,716 --> 00:45:44,353
Don't you see? Mitsuko had to
give up everything for me.

476
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:46,468
Her home and her family in Japan.

477
00:45:46,651 --> 00:45:49,264
- She even lied in court.
- Mmm.

478
00:45:49,485 --> 00:45:52,130
I've always heard that Japanese women
are born to lie.

479
00:45:55,154 --> 00:45:59,455
It's simple.
She's just not welcome here.

480
00:45:59,756 --> 00:46:01,606
Understand?

481
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:05,427
She can leave by herself,
Or you both leave Jing Wu.

482
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:08,945
But, Master,
why can't Mitsuko stay?

483
00:46:09,191 --> 00:46:12,000
What side are you on?
The Chinese or the Japanese?

484
00:46:12,225 --> 00:46:14,773
- That's not it.
- Now you're a traitor
to your own people.

485
00:46:14,993 --> 00:46:17,225
- You try saying that again.
- And what?

486
00:46:17,428 --> 00:46:19,529
- Wait! Chen!
- All right, that's enough!

487
00:46:22,796 --> 00:46:26,585
There's something
that we have to decide...

488
00:46:26,863 --> 00:46:29,988
or Jing Wu cannot go on.

489
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:34,564
It would seem
you and I are in a battle...

490
00:46:34,865 --> 00:46:37,794
for the leadership position.

491
00:46:38,033 --> 00:46:41,093
- I don't know what you mean, Ting En.
- Don't play games.

492
00:46:41,335 --> 00:46:46,082
Listen, if you want to be in charge,
then fight me for it.

493
00:46:46,402 --> 00:46:50,137
I can be Master...
only by beating you.

494
00:46:52,204 --> 00:46:55,546
If you win, Jing Wu is yours.

495
00:48:22,398 --> 00:48:25,239
- Yeah!
- Hey, come on!

496
00:50:08,028 --> 00:50:10,869
Help get him up.

497
00:50:11,096 --> 00:50:13,643
Master, are you hurt?

498
00:50:14,621 --> 00:50:17,266
Is it finished?

499
00:50:17,489 --> 00:50:20,298
It's yours.

500
00:50:20,522 --> 00:50:22,341
- Take Jing Wu.
- No!

501
00:50:22,523 --> 00:50:27,118
I don't want Jing Wu,
but I won't leave Mitsuko.

502
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:30,679
If we have to leave together...

503
00:50:30,926 --> 00:50:32,744
then I guess it's good-bye.

504
00:51:03,368 --> 00:51:05,273
- Chen told me. It's a real mess.
- Uh-huh.

505
00:51:05,469 --> 00:51:07,287
Boy!

506
00:51:11,636 --> 00:51:14,499
- Wait here. I'll get us a room.
- All right.

507
00:51:17,438 --> 00:51:19,322
Sir, any rooms?

508
00:51:19,505 --> 00:51:22,794
- Sure. Right this way, sir.
- Okay.

509
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:26,382
- Let's go.

510
00:51:26,641 --> 00:51:31,387
Oh, she's Japanese.
Please, not in my hotel.

511
00:51:31,709 --> 00:51:33,809
We're together.
You understand.

512
00:51:34,009 --> 00:51:35,947
- Look at them.
- That's Chen Zhen!

513
00:51:36,146 --> 00:51:39,434
- He's a traitor.
- Look, I'm sorry.

514
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,293
- You don't belong here!
- Go back to Japan!

515
00:51:42,514 --> 00:51:46,085
- Get out of here.
- Go away before any of you gets hurt.

516
00:51:46,348 --> 00:51:49,059
- Come on. Let's go.
- Getouttahere!

517
00:51:49,282 --> 00:51:51,416
Traitor! Japanese!

518
00:52:14,856 --> 00:52:16,674
- A mouse?
- What's the matter?

519
00:52:16,857 --> 00:52:18,860
In there. I saw it!

520
00:52:19,057 --> 00:52:21,028
Really?

521
00:52:24,425 --> 00:52:27,071
- Where?
- I don't know. I saw it over there.

522
00:52:27,292 --> 00:52:30,253
- Ahh!
- I don't see it.

523
00:52:36,195 --> 00:52:38,231
You probably scared it away.

524
00:52:39,996 --> 00:52:42,989
Oh! I know it's silly.

525
00:52:43,231 --> 00:52:46,900
- But I'm the one who's scared.
- In Kyoto, aren't there
any mice or rats?

526
00:52:47,165 --> 00:52:50,028
Mm-hmm. But I was afraid of them.

527
00:52:52,166 --> 00:52:56,630
I'm sorry. I thought you'd
really like it living here.

528
00:52:56,933 --> 00:52:59,416
I'm sure I can get used to it.

529
00:52:59,635 --> 00:53:03,653
Oh, we have a great view!
Much nicer than a hotel.

530
00:53:03,936 --> 00:53:07,126
It's beautiful here.
I know you'll be very happy.

531
00:53:07,371 --> 00:53:09,732
And what about you?

532
00:53:11,339 --> 00:53:13,374
Jing Wu was my family.

533
00:53:13,572 --> 00:53:16,217
Without them,
it's almost like starting over.

534
00:53:16,439 --> 00:53:20,044
- Do you think you can?
- Why not?

535
00:53:20,307 --> 00:53:23,944
Jing Wu is your family, and you
can't live without your family.

536
00:53:24,208 --> 00:53:26,440
You know you can't.

537
00:53:28,176 --> 00:53:31,333
I think I know you
a little better than you do.

538
00:53:34,378 --> 00:53:37,306
- Is that so?
- Mm-hmm.

539
00:53:50,749 --> 00:53:52,981
- Here's your tea.
- Hmm.

540
00:53:53,183 --> 00:53:55,284
Hey, have you eaten?

541
00:53:55,483 --> 00:53:58,227
Not since breakfast.

542
00:53:58,452 --> 00:54:01,544
Heard from Ting En?

543
00:54:03,151 --> 00:54:05,002
Ah, I knew it.

544
00:54:05,186 --> 00:54:09,911
It was hard for him to lose, especially
to Chen Zhen. They were really close.

545
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:14,074
Ting En's pride is still hurting.
I'm afraid we'll lose him.

546
00:54:14,356 --> 00:54:16,968
Then what are we
supposed to do?

547
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:19,640
Forget about our school's future
and our good name?

548
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:24,547
Suppose someone challenges us.

549
00:54:24,791 --> 00:54:28,264
- Hey, who else can teach?
- Cheung and Biu.

550
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:34,997
Were we to receive a challenge,
we're in trouble.

551
00:54:36,713 --> 00:54:38,782
My mother wrote to me.

552
00:54:38,981 --> 00:54:42,236
She said Jing Wu
Angered Japan.

553
00:54:42,481 --> 00:54:44,865
She told me to come home.

554
00:54:45,083 --> 00:54:49,481
- If there's trouble,
you'll be safe here.
- It still worries me.

555
00:54:49,783 --> 00:54:52,200
Don't worry.
We watch out for our people.

556
00:54:52,417 --> 00:54:54,453
We protect them all, everyone.

557
00:55:02,754 --> 00:55:04,604
You Chinese are wasteful.

558
00:55:04,787 --> 00:55:07,084
So few of you,
and all this food!

559
00:55:07,289 --> 00:55:09,520
What's this?

560
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:13,773
We're here with a proposal
for the Jing Wu Master.

561
00:55:14,056 --> 00:55:16,572
He shouldn't be bothered.
Let me look at it.

562
00:55:16,791 --> 00:55:21,669
The great Funakoshi, a Sensai...

563
00:55:21,993 --> 00:55:24,802
issues a challenge
to Jing Wu.

564
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:39,708
-  What do we do?
- We should find Master!

565
00:55:39,931 --> 00:55:43,240
- For this fight,
we need Chen Zhen, not Master!
- He's gone over to the enemy.

566
00:55:43,498 --> 00:55:45,915
- You'd better watch what you're saying!
- Or what?

567
00:55:46,132 --> 00:55:49,224
That's enough of this foolishness.
Go and fight somewhere else.

568
00:55:49,467 --> 00:55:52,526
Get out there and find Ting En.
Go! You help him.

569
00:55:59,303 --> 00:56:01,338
- Uncle?
- Uncle?

570
00:56:04,237 --> 00:56:06,056
Cheung.

571
00:56:07,472 --> 00:56:11,109
- He doesn't want us to find him.
- That's for sure.

572
00:56:14,207 --> 00:56:16,025
So what's going on?

573
00:56:16,207 --> 00:56:20,671
- What's going on? Where's the money?
- Shh.

574
00:56:23,776 --> 00:56:26,073
Try to show some patience,
all right?

575
00:56:26,276 --> 00:56:29,881
- If I wait much longer,
they'll discover me.
- No, they won't.

576
00:56:30,144 --> 00:56:32,855
The Japanese can keep a secret.
How will anyone know?

577
00:56:33,078 --> 00:56:37,890
- Because it's traceable.
- No, it's not traceable.
Not to you or me.

578
00:56:38,213 --> 00:56:39,672
It isn't right.

579
00:56:39,848 --> 00:56:42,363
I did give the drug
to Master Hou, didn't I?

580
00:56:42,581 --> 00:56:45,031
You did your job,
so don't worry!

581
00:56:45,249 --> 00:56:48,722
You'll get your money.
And you know what's better?

582
00:56:48,983 --> 00:56:52,423
When the Japanese take over,
then we'll be set.

583
00:56:52,684 --> 00:56:56,092
Then there'll be lots of money.
Do you understand?

584
00:57:01,286 --> 00:57:04,476
I wish I had known.

585
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:08,487
You should've told me
that Thorazide was poisonous!

586
00:57:08,756 --> 00:57:10,955
I never would've
Given it to him.

587
00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:20,098
[Woman Screams]
Help! Help!

588
00:57:21,692 --> 00:57:23,510
It's the cook!

589
00:57:23,692 --> 00:57:25,510
Someone help me
get him down!

590
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:31,070
Lift him off the rope! Now!

591
00:57:31,328 --> 00:57:34,550
Come on.
Let's move it along.

592
00:57:41,164 --> 00:57:44,898
- We found traces of Thorazide on this.
- Really?

593
00:57:45,166 --> 00:57:47,648
That's the bark
Of a ginkgo tree.

594
00:57:47,867 --> 00:57:51,569
- It's used for asthma.
- What did he say we do with it?

595
00:57:51,834 --> 00:57:55,503
Wait, the Master had asthma.
And the cook used to treat it.

596
00:57:55,770 --> 00:57:57,588
- Oh, he did?
- Uh-huh.

597
00:57:57,770 --> 00:58:01,722
That means the cook's the one
who gave him the poison.

598
00:58:02,003 --> 00:58:04,932
That's very interesting.

599
00:58:05,508 --> 00:58:08,849
Hey, listen, Captain.
Let's keep this quiet, okay?

600
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:11,886
Makes no difference.
He's dead anyway.

601
00:58:12,111 --> 00:58:14,887
We can't keep a murder a secret!

602
00:58:15,111 --> 00:58:18,170
For all we know,
there may be others involved.

603
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:22,526
We're really gonna have
to investigate to find out for sure.

604
00:58:22,812 --> 00:58:24,978
An investigation.

605
00:58:25,178 --> 00:58:27,475
The school will never survive
this scandal.

606
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,682
Ask him.

607
00:58:31,113 --> 00:58:33,857
Captain, so now what?

608
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:35,963
Go investigate some more.

609
00:58:36,147 --> 00:58:38,858
How 'bout these?
What now?

610
00:58:39,081 --> 00:58:41,345
Get an analysis done
right away.

611
00:58:41,547 --> 00:58:45,433
Captain, could you help me
look for Ting En now?

612
00:58:45,715 --> 00:58:48,076
Don't worry.
I'll find him.

613
00:59:10,285 --> 00:59:12,549
Excuse me.
Are you looking for someone?

614
00:59:12,753 --> 00:59:15,845
I wonder if I could
please talk to Mr. Nang?

615
00:59:16,086 --> 00:59:19,276
- He's right here. Follow me.
- Mmm.

616
00:59:23,421 --> 00:59:25,750
Uncle, this lady's here
to see you.

617
00:59:25,955 --> 00:59:28,763
- Can I help you?
- I hope so.

618
00:59:28,988 --> 00:59:33,168
I know that you and the whole police
force have been looking for Ting En.

619
00:59:33,455 --> 00:59:35,937
Do you know
where I might find him?

620
00:59:37,856 --> 00:59:42,189
- Uh, the Star House.
- A whorehouse?

621
00:59:42,490 --> 00:59:45,615
- Mmm.

622
01:00:00,358 --> 01:00:02,688
Is he staying with you?

623
01:00:04,092 --> 01:00:05,910
He is.

624
01:00:11,327 --> 01:00:14,223
How long have you been seeing him?

625
01:00:15,894 --> 01:00:18,376
About a year,
maybe longer.

626
01:00:19,862 --> 01:00:24,456
For the first few months,
he seemed to be happy.

627
01:00:24,763 --> 01:00:28,464
Now he fights all the time.
He talks about Jing Wu.

628
01:00:28,730 --> 01:00:31,984
About how he misses his home.

629
01:00:32,231 --> 01:00:35,964
I think--
Won't you try and take him home?

630
01:00:55,801 --> 01:00:57,042
Ting En!

631
01:01:00,034 --> 01:01:02,745
Let me go! No!

632
01:01:02,969 --> 01:01:05,995
I'm gonna kill 'em! I wanna fight!

633
01:01:06,236 --> 01:01:08,783
Let me go, you--

634
01:01:12,035 --> 01:01:14,583
Here, drink some tea.

635
01:01:16,536 --> 01:01:19,791
Mmm.

636
01:01:27,171 --> 01:01:29,533
Let's go.

637
01:01:29,739 --> 01:01:31,589
You're here.

638
01:01:31,773 --> 01:01:34,734
There must be a reason.

639
01:01:34,973 --> 01:01:37,204
The Niguchi Clan
came to see us.

640
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:39,857
They've challenged you.

641
01:01:41,074 --> 01:01:43,076
What about Chen?

642
01:01:43,274 --> 01:01:47,704
You are the Master of Jing Wu.
You represent us.

643
01:01:49,941 --> 01:01:52,717
You try talking to him.

644
01:01:52,942 --> 01:01:55,358
When is it?

645
01:01:57,609 --> 01:01:59,514
I'll fight.

646
01:02:02,743 --> 01:02:05,519
You'll come back?

647
01:02:05,743 --> 01:02:07,430
Of course.

648
01:02:07,611 --> 01:02:10,800
My home will always be Jing Wu.

649
01:02:13,278 --> 01:02:15,477
Hey, Ting En.

650
01:02:18,179 --> 01:02:20,117
What about Miss Shien?

651
01:02:22,613 --> 01:02:25,225
You're going to leave her
after all she's done?

652
01:02:25,446 --> 01:02:27,613
You buy her out.

653
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:32,156
- Get the Madam.
- Yes, sir.

654
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:34,895
We'll pay.

655
01:02:38,248 --> 01:02:41,590
I guess you won't be wearing
all those fancy dresses anymore.

656
01:02:41,849 --> 01:02:44,657
No, but I really
won't miss them.

657
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:50,145
That one fits you well,
and it looks so good on you.

658
01:02:50,383 --> 01:02:55,521
I've investigated. Funakoshi
is the best warrior of his clan,
in fact, in all of Japan.

659
01:02:55,851 --> 01:02:57,669
But don't you worry.
He's getting old now.

660
01:02:57,851 --> 01:03:00,714
- Uncle Nang.
- Uncle Nang!

661
01:03:00,951 --> 01:03:04,173
Hey, she looks good.

662
01:03:07,886 --> 01:03:11,227
Hey, listen, I think you'll fit in
Really well here.

663
01:03:11,486 --> 01:03:12,977
Thank you.

664
01:03:13,153 --> 01:03:16,855
You could be as kind
to Mitsuko.

665
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:19,417
That's different.
Mitsuko is Japanese.

666
01:03:19,621 --> 01:03:23,061
Ting En, the challenge
is on for tomorrow. Practice.

667
01:03:23,321 --> 01:03:26,064
Mm-hmm.

668
01:03:34,856 --> 01:03:37,403
- Mmm.
- Thanks.

669
01:03:37,624 --> 01:03:39,529
- You, come on.
- Okay.

670
01:03:39,724 --> 01:03:41,575
- Let's go. Drink later.
- Thankyou.

671
01:03:41,757 --> 01:03:43,641
Come on.

672
01:03:45,891 --> 01:03:48,188
He looks strong.

673
01:03:48,391 --> 01:03:50,558
The challenge is tomorrow.

674
01:03:50,758 --> 01:03:52,761
Ting En against
the Niguchi Master.

675
01:03:55,026 --> 01:03:58,596
Then he must be the best
At Jing Wu now.

676
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:00,927
He is.

677
01:04:01,127 --> 01:04:03,543
Better than Chen?

678
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:07,233
It's not important.
They're both good.

679
01:04:14,028 --> 01:04:16,260
- Master, I'm sorry.
- Are you hurt?

680
01:04:16,462 --> 01:04:19,423
I'm fine.
Hey, I'm okay.

681
01:04:23,030 --> 01:04:26,600
- What's wrong? He isn't the same.
- Hmm.

682
01:05:06,805 --> 01:05:09,581
Funakoshi,
you will fight Ting En tomorrow.

683
01:05:16,772 --> 01:05:19,036
Fujita...

684
01:05:19,238 --> 01:05:24,855
don't even dare try to tell me...
who I will challenge.

685
01:05:25,207 --> 01:05:28,364
So it's Chen Zhen.
Then let me tell you something.

686
01:05:28,606 --> 01:05:32,210
I know all about him...
and your niece.

687
01:05:34,575 --> 01:05:38,907
So? Mitsuko is in no way
any of your concern.

688
01:05:39,209 --> 01:05:41,570
I'll make her my concern
If she's your weakness.

689
01:05:41,775 --> 01:05:44,486
Hmph.

690
01:05:44,708 --> 01:05:49,967
Whatever weakness is that the General
is perceiving would have to be his own.

691
01:05:50,310 --> 01:05:53,086
I have none.

692
01:06:11,547 --> 01:06:13,452
You're up early today.

693
01:06:14,271 --> 01:06:16,176
Good morning.

694
01:06:23,836 --> 01:06:27,057
Oh, look,
isn't that Uncle?

695
01:06:27,302 --> 01:06:29,533
- It is you!
- Oh, Mitsuko!

696
01:06:29,735 --> 01:06:32,630
If I'd known you live so far from town,
I'd have hired a carriage.

697
01:06:32,867 --> 01:06:37,079
- Did my father send you?
- No. In fact,
he doesn't even know I'm here.

698
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:39,783
Then why'd you come
all this way?

699
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,114
- To see him.
- Chen Zhen?

700
01:06:44,399 --> 01:06:48,186
- Are you married?
- Not yet.

701
01:06:48,466 --> 01:06:51,077
- Do you want to be?
- I think so...

702
01:06:51,298 --> 01:06:54,291
if the Chinese and Japanese
ever stop fighting.

703
01:06:54,531 --> 01:06:56,859
It's good you're not married.

704
01:06:57,065 --> 01:07:00,830
You're much too young...
to become a widow.

705
01:07:01,097 --> 01:07:02,914
What's that?

706
01:07:03,097 --> 01:07:07,210
And if you should die,
I'll send your ashes back to Japan.

707
01:07:07,496 --> 01:07:10,456
You sound very confident.

708
01:07:12,828 --> 01:07:15,505
Why didn't you tell me
you're gonna fight my uncle?

709
01:07:15,728 --> 01:07:18,754
Well, he didn't want
to worry you.

710
01:07:18,994 --> 01:07:21,225
Chen Zhen, come.

711
01:07:30,458 --> 01:07:34,638
So anxious. Why don't you
show me what you've learned?

712
01:07:42,956 --> 01:07:46,395
It's about the energy. About focusing
on a single point in time.

713
01:07:46,656 --> 01:07:49,648
So, it's about energy.

714
01:07:49,889 --> 01:07:54,482
But tell me something. Does a rock have
as much energy as an opponent would?

715
01:07:54,788 --> 01:07:57,814
You need a more powerful stroke
When you're fighting a human being.

716
01:07:59,554 --> 01:08:01,720
Let's see how I can put it
into action.

717
01:08:01,921 --> 01:08:05,327
Hmph. What else
has Master Hou taught you?

718
01:08:05,586 --> 01:08:08,481
Simple.
Observe your opponent.

719
01:08:08,719 --> 01:08:11,527
Attack him.
Learn to exploit his weakness.

720
01:08:11,751 --> 01:08:16,083
Ah! Sounds to me like
you've been learning karate...

721
01:08:16,384 --> 01:08:18,354
becoming samurai.

722
01:08:18,551 --> 01:08:22,731
Not from Master Hou.
He taught us the art of kung fu.

723
01:08:23,017 --> 01:08:28,154
Just because the principles are similar,
does it mean we learn karate?

724
01:08:28,483 --> 01:08:30,387
Hmm.

725
01:08:30,582 --> 01:08:35,392
So tell me what lessons you've learned
about controlling one's anger.

726
01:08:35,715 --> 01:08:38,076
Don't tell me your Master
forgot that one?

727
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:41,687
You didn't come here to talk.
It's time.

728
01:08:41,947 --> 01:08:44,275
Hmm.

729
01:08:49,779 --> 01:08:51,879
Wait!

730
01:09:16,875 --> 01:09:19,258
Hold it!

731
01:09:19,474 --> 01:09:21,509
I need to warm up.

732
01:10:35,364 --> 01:10:37,399
Huh?
What style is that?

733
01:10:37,597 --> 01:10:39,697
Don't worry.
I'll show it to you.

734
01:10:39,896 --> 01:10:41,713
Oh!

735
01:12:01,084 --> 01:12:05,263
- Can you see?
- I'll manage.

736
01:12:05,550 --> 01:12:07,302
We'll make it even.

737
01:14:37,559 --> 01:14:39,790
The battle's done.

738
01:14:42,692 --> 01:14:45,238
Are you all right?

739
01:14:45,458 --> 01:14:49,725
I'm surprised. You're still
So young... yet so skillful.

740
01:14:51,157 --> 01:14:53,518
Your talent...
is astonishing.

741
01:14:53,723 --> 01:14:56,531
In Japan,
there is a proverb...

742
01:14:56,757 --> 01:14:59,564
that says experience should fear
the strength of youth.

743
01:15:03,822 --> 01:15:05,704
But you won!

744
01:15:05,888 --> 01:15:08,946
Sure, because I
adapted to you.

745
01:15:09,188 --> 01:15:11,222
With your ability...

746
01:15:11,421 --> 01:15:16,623
if you learn to be fluid, to adapt,
you'll always be unbeatable.

747
01:15:16,953 --> 01:15:20,261
It seems I have
a lot to learn about fighting.

748
01:15:20,518 --> 01:15:22,401
You're not alone.

749
01:15:22,585 --> 01:15:24,719
But try to understand.

750
01:15:24,918 --> 01:15:26,985
When you learn how to adapt...

751
01:15:27,185 --> 01:15:29,122
you'll be unstoppable.

752
01:15:29,317 --> 01:15:32,027
See, Chen Zhen?

753
01:15:32,250 --> 01:15:35,340
When you redirect
your opponent's energy...

754
01:15:35,583 --> 01:15:38,259
you force him to change.

755
01:15:38,483 --> 01:15:41,094
So, in essence,
he defeats himself.

756
01:15:41,316 --> 01:15:43,644
See? That's it.

757
01:15:45,382 --> 01:15:48,538
Are you going back to Japan?

758
01:15:48,781 --> 01:15:51,969
Chen Zhen, our fight is over.

759
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:54,119
Yes.

760
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:59,483
However, there is another
Japanese Master...

761
01:15:59,746 --> 01:16:02,129
who is known as
the ''Supreme Killer.''

762
01:16:02,346 --> 01:16:05,437
Chen Zhen told me
you were the best ofall the clans.

763
01:16:05,678 --> 01:16:09,314
He is a man of dignity
and a samurai warrior...

764
01:16:09,578 --> 01:16:11,874
but that does not
make him a killer.

765
01:16:12,077 --> 01:16:13,634
Hmm.

766
01:16:13,811 --> 01:16:18,687
Now your Master would surely
be proud of his disciple.

767
01:16:22,742 --> 01:16:25,833
The most powerful fighter
at the Niguchi Arena...

768
01:16:26,075 --> 01:16:29,579
is a man called
General Fujita.

769
01:16:29,842 --> 01:16:31,811
Take care when you fight him.

770
01:16:49,738 --> 01:16:52,601
Oh, white wins out.

771
01:16:56,437 --> 01:16:59,691
Your skill has improved
a lot since the last time.

772
01:16:59,936 --> 01:17:02,135
Thankyou.

773
01:17:02,336 --> 01:17:06,287
You know, I think
General Fujita has become...

774
01:17:06,568 --> 01:17:10,137
obsessed with conquering
all of Jing Wu Mun...

775
01:17:10,401 --> 01:17:13,077
and eventually Shanghai.

776
01:17:13,301 --> 01:17:15,750
It's become important to him...

777
01:17:15,968 --> 01:17:19,091
as the first step of...

778
01:17:19,334 --> 01:17:22,109
conquering all of China.

779
01:17:22,333 --> 01:17:24,629
I-Is he serious?

780
01:17:27,132 --> 01:17:29,265
That's impossible.
He must be crazy.

781
01:17:29,466 --> 01:17:31,664
I tell you,
that's what he's doing!

782
01:17:31,864 --> 01:17:35,368
If you observe
his troop movements...

783
01:17:35,631 --> 01:17:37,927
his plan becomes obvious.

784
01:17:38,130 --> 01:17:40,067
There's just no way.

785
01:17:40,264 --> 01:17:43,039
Japan is like an insect
whose objective...

786
01:17:43,263 --> 01:17:46,103
is to destroy an elephant.

787
01:17:46,330 --> 01:17:50,378
While the elephant is asleep,
The insect has the advantage.

788
01:17:50,663 --> 01:17:54,907
But as soon
as the elephant wakes...

789
01:17:55,195 --> 01:17:59,047
it has the strength
to eliminate the insect!

790
01:17:59,328 --> 01:18:01,711
And, yet again...

791
01:18:01,927 --> 01:18:05,943
if the military
can take control of Shanghai...

792
01:18:06,227 --> 01:18:08,937
it will weaken the elephant
in a big way.

793
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:11,195
But it is still impossible!

794
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:21,531
Okay. Let's say the parable
is about a venomous insect...

795
01:18:21,858 --> 01:18:25,014
and it can strike
the elephant's heart.

796
01:18:25,257 --> 01:18:28,761
Before it wakes up,
it's already paralyzed.

797
01:18:29,023 --> 01:18:32,082
Japan has such insects.

798
01:18:32,323 --> 01:18:34,870
Just look at General Fujita.

799
01:18:36,322 --> 01:18:38,836
There are far too manylike him.

800
01:18:39,056 --> 01:18:43,616
If that's true,
then a war will be unavoidable.

801
01:19:08,717 --> 01:19:10,915
- You're back!

802
01:19:13,849 --> 01:19:15,667
Hello.

803
01:19:15,849 --> 01:19:18,624
Chen Zhen?

804
01:19:18,848 --> 01:19:21,427
He'll be back.

805
01:19:21,648 --> 01:19:24,031
Ah...

806
01:19:24,248 --> 01:19:26,382
please, have a seat.

807
01:19:43,911 --> 01:19:46,294
Some tea?

808
01:19:46,511 --> 01:19:48,295
Thanks.

809
01:19:54,343 --> 01:19:56,193
Are you happy here?

810
01:19:56,376 --> 01:19:58,672
Mm-hmm.
We are.

811
01:20:00,176 --> 01:20:02,026
That's good.

812
01:20:06,574 --> 01:20:11,003
Oh, Chen Zhen!
Look, it's Ting En.

813
01:20:26,438 --> 01:20:29,148
Still practicing,
quite a bit?

814
01:20:29,370 --> 01:20:31,373
Whenever I can, of course.

815
01:20:31,570 --> 01:20:33,387
And Jing Wu?

816
01:20:33,570 --> 01:20:38,315
What about it?
I miss it, but...

817
01:20:38,636 --> 01:20:40,997
as you can see
I have a new life.

818
01:20:42,202 --> 01:20:44,172
But we need you there.

819
01:20:52,234 --> 01:20:54,683
Shien Han, she has moved in.

820
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:58,241
- From the brothel?
- Mm-hmm. It's working out.

821
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:00,089
Good!

822
01:21:00,265 --> 01:21:03,008
You could bring Mitsuko too.

823
01:21:06,065 --> 01:21:09,984
They'll accept Shien Han,
but not Mitsuko.

824
01:21:10,264 --> 01:21:12,908
It's really too bad.

825
01:21:13,130 --> 01:21:16,156
She means a lot to you.
She is a good woman.

826
01:21:18,096 --> 01:21:20,958
Not everyone believes that.
If I were to bring her there...

827
01:21:21,195 --> 01:21:23,045
it would cause
too much trouble.

828
01:21:23,229 --> 01:21:25,808
- I can't be that selfish.
- It's your decision.

829
01:21:26,029 --> 01:21:28,772
I learned a new style.

830
01:21:28,994 --> 01:21:31,061
- What is it?
- I'll show you!

831
01:22:09,771 --> 01:22:11,737
This is the same
as the Hou style.

832
01:22:11,934 --> 01:22:14,887
Yes. The Hou Fist Method.

833
01:22:15,127 --> 01:22:17,635
I remember.
But it's only for the Hou Clan.

834
01:22:17,854 --> 01:22:20,775
That was true,
but now things are different.

835
01:22:21,015 --> 01:22:23,110
The whole school
has to learn it.

836
01:22:23,310 --> 01:22:25,503
Chen Zhen, listen.

837
01:22:25,705 --> 01:22:28,822
Tomorrow I fight at Niguchi.
If anything happens...

838
01:22:29,064 --> 01:22:31,985
teach this style
to the others.

839
01:22:54,253 --> 01:22:56,099
My dear Chen Zhen...

840
01:22:56,281 --> 01:22:58,790
I have decided
to return home.

841
01:22:59,008 --> 01:23:02,984
I understand why this fight
is important to you and your country...

842
01:23:03,266 --> 01:23:05,872
and I think my being with you
is hurting your cause.

843
01:23:06,093 --> 01:23:08,222
Fulfiill your promise.

844
01:23:08,422 --> 01:23:10,832
And when the soldiers
return to Japan...

845
01:23:11,049 --> 01:23:14,350
I will be waiting for you
in Kyoto. ''

846
01:24:08,850 --> 01:24:10,816
Lun will come with me.

847
01:24:11,013 --> 01:24:15,564
Ting En, I'm worried. Maybe you
should have more men with you.

848
01:24:15,868 --> 01:24:17,682
There's nothing
to worry about.

849
01:24:17,864 --> 01:24:20,437
They know the rules.
Only two men can fight.

850
01:24:20,658 --> 01:24:23,492
Yes. That's right.

851
01:24:24,751 --> 01:24:28,052
Xiao Wei,
take care of her... please.

852
01:24:28,311 --> 01:24:30,125
Mm-hmm.

853
01:24:33,765 --> 01:24:36,175
Wait. Ting En.

854
01:24:39,486 --> 01:24:41,712
I'll go with you
If you want.

855
01:24:42,546 --> 01:24:44,360
Mmm.

856
01:24:46,870 --> 01:24:49,096
Let's go.

857
01:24:49,298 --> 01:24:51,426
Good!

858
01:24:51,627 --> 01:24:54,396
How about those two?
Together again!

859
01:24:54,620 --> 01:24:58,627
Sensai Funakoshi left Shanghai
early this morning.

860
01:24:58,911 --> 01:25:00,844
He's a stubborn old fool.

861
01:25:01,039 --> 01:25:03,298
With or without him,
the fight goes on.

862
01:25:03,501 --> 01:25:06,238
I will deal with him
another time.

863
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:08,904
Yes.

864
01:25:09,121 --> 01:25:12,879
General, then we are still
going to fight Jing Wu Mun?

865
01:25:13,146 --> 01:25:16,926
Yes. We can't rely
on Funakoshi for everything.

866
01:25:17,204 --> 01:25:20,060
I'm going to personally
handle this matter.

867
01:25:40,852 --> 01:25:43,621
So you've accepted.
That's good.

868
01:25:45,176 --> 01:25:48,162
First, though, I have something
you should see.

869
01:25:48,402 --> 01:25:50,183
I have Master Hou's murderer.

870
01:25:54,622 --> 01:25:57,326
Come here!

871
01:26:05,565 --> 01:26:07,694
Mr. Cheung accepted a bribe.

872
01:26:07,892 --> 01:26:11,389
He and the cook soaked
the bark of the gingko... in poison.

873
01:26:24,656 --> 01:26:28,153
It's over.
Take him away.

874
01:26:31,509 --> 01:26:34,626
- Move your men out. Move them out.
- Yes, sir.

875
01:26:34,868 --> 01:26:36,682
All right, everyone out.

876
01:26:44,624 --> 01:26:45,667
It reads ''Jing Wu is closed.''...

877
01:26:45,668 --> 01:26:48,034
You may open the gates back and destroy the sign...

878
01:26:48,035 --> 01:26:48,950
if you can defeat me.

879
01:27:50,532 --> 01:27:52,726
Here, catch this!

880
01:35:24,582 --> 01:35:27,471
- Can you walk? Come on.
- Yeah.

881
01:36:50,458 --> 01:36:53,195
Halt! General?

882
01:37:01,228 --> 01:37:04,312
Ambassador, the General, he's dead.

883
01:37:09,344 --> 01:37:13,416
Come on! Police!
Don't move or I'll shoot!

884
01:37:13,702 --> 01:37:16,308
- We okay here?
- Are you all right?

885
01:37:16,528 --> 01:37:20,188
Freeze! You are all
in the Japanese compound.

886
01:37:20,453 --> 01:37:22,483
You have no authority here.

887
01:37:23,481 --> 01:37:27,772
Soldier, these weapons
are all the authority we need.

888
01:37:27,921 --> 01:37:30,082
These men are Chinese,
and they're in our custody.

889
01:37:30,283 --> 01:37:33,433
What? I order you
to turn them over!

890
01:37:33,677 --> 01:37:36,762
- Don't move! Freeze!
- Hold it!

891
01:37:37,002 --> 01:37:39,000
Now we'll see who gives
the orders in my country.

892
01:37:40,428 --> 01:37:42,242
Stop it!

893
01:37:43,921 --> 01:37:46,843
Everyone, hold your fire!

894
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:52,206
Now then, this argument
will be solved in a peaceful manner.

895
01:37:52,536 --> 01:37:54,414
The General is dead.

896
01:37:54,597 --> 01:37:57,877
But there will be
no more lost lives!

897
01:37:58,123 --> 01:37:59,937
- Sergeant!
- Yes, sir?

898
01:38:00,119 --> 01:38:01,965
Remove your platoon!

899
01:38:02,149 --> 01:38:04,472
But, sir!

900
01:38:04,675 --> 01:38:07,727
I'm the one that's in charge now.
Understand?

901
01:38:07,969 --> 01:38:10,478
You will all do
as you're ordered!

902
01:38:10,696 --> 01:38:13,781
Yes, sir.
Company, move out.

903
01:38:24,034 --> 01:38:28,747
Captain,
A Japanese general is dead.

904
01:38:29,055 --> 01:38:31,466
I must know who killed him.

905
01:38:31,683 --> 01:38:35,527
Someone will be held responsible.

906
01:38:35,808 --> 01:38:37,709
Otherwise the military
won't let it go.

907
01:38:37,903 --> 01:38:42,834
You need a scapegoat
to prevent our countries going to war.

908
01:38:43,158 --> 01:38:45,091
Mmm.

909
01:38:49,444 --> 01:38:52,941
All right.
I'm going to be that man.

910
01:38:53,203 --> 01:38:55,331
No! He can't do that.

911
01:38:59,256 --> 01:39:03,547
China will be in your debt.

912
01:39:11,452 --> 01:39:14,406
Let us in! Let us in!

913
01:39:14,645 --> 01:39:16,491
Open up!

914
01:39:17,605 --> 01:39:20,939
Tell us what's happened.

915
01:39:29,179 --> 01:39:30,993
Tell us!

916
01:39:34,867 --> 01:39:36,681
Who is it?

917
01:39:37,860 --> 01:39:39,858
What's going on?

918
01:39:50,365 --> 01:39:53,617
What did I tell you?
I knew the Japanese forces would--

919
01:39:53,868 --> 01:39:56,506
Lives were lost this time.
It's terrible.

920
01:39:56,724 --> 01:40:00,697
You know the Japanese soldiers
are responsible for this.

921
01:40:00,975 --> 01:40:03,761
I knew there'd be killing.
I tried to tell. No one listens to me.

922
01:40:03,991 --> 01:40:08,060
Chen Zhen, he was the real hero.
Let me tell you.

923
01:40:08,339 --> 01:40:11,559
He took on the Niguchi warriors,
and he beat them all!

924
01:40:11,810 --> 01:40:14,226
I know.
I saw it myself.

925
01:40:14,438 --> 01:40:17,077
Ahh. Then the soldiers shot him.

926
01:40:21,121 --> 01:40:23,292
What's wrong?
Who is it?

927
01:40:23,490 --> 01:40:25,598
No one, no one.
Go on.

928
01:40:31,244 --> 01:40:34,962
I can't believe you have to leave
Shanghai and start all over.

929
01:40:35,234 --> 01:40:39,144
- Are you going to be with Mitsuko?
- Mm-hmm.

930
01:40:41,161 --> 01:40:43,766
If I no longer have a country...

931
01:40:43,983 --> 01:40:46,928
at least I can be
with the woman I love.
