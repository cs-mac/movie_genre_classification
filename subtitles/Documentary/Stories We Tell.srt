    "though not knowing

480
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:43,107
    What? Yeah,
    we all knew.

481
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:45,876
 Did anyone know she was
 gonna die? Well...

482
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,244
 When she had cancer?
                       Mmm-hmm.

483
00:25:47,246 --> 00:25:49,079
  Yeah? Did you know?

484
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:52,016
  <i>No, you didn't know.</i>
                    <i>SARAH: No.</i>

485
00:25:52,018 --> 00:25:54,184
   MORT: <i>She was just a mess.</i>

486
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:56,220
        <i>She was very, very,</i>
        <i>very frightened.</i>

487
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:57,888
       <i>With so much energy,</i>

488
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,757
         <i>all of her energy</i>

      <i>uncertainty and her fear</i>
      <i>and unhappiness.</i>

490
00:26:02,962 --> 00:26:05,796

 it was like holding a...

  ever held a bird
  in your hand.

492
00:26:08,668 --> 00:26:11,869
  You know, it was
  terrified and you'd just
  feel its heartbeat.

493
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:13,270
     Do you know
     what I mean?
                    SARAH: Mmm.

494
00:26:13,272 --> 00:26:15,639
 She was just shaking.

495
00:26:15,641 --> 00:26:17,708
        SARAH: Did you get
        the sense that
        she knew she was dying?

496
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,978
 (WHISPERS) Yeah. Yeah.

497
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,213

00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:35,993
            <i>I came home one day</i>

            <i>the driveway,</i>

502
00:26:35,995 --> 00:26:39,863
   scraping down a table
   so that she could repaint it
   for the house, you know?

503
00:26:39,865 --> 00:26:42,166
          Um... So I think,

504
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:45,836
           she didn't have
           any real sense.

505
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:47,371
           I said to her,

506
00:26:47,373 --> 00:26:49,740
         "What on earth
         are you doing out here
         doing the table?"

507
00:26:49,742 --> 00:26:51,942
            And she said,
            "Oh, well...

         sort of four or five
         weeks away from death.

512

    That's a person

514
00:27:10,229 --> 00:27:12,896
    As it progressed,
    she was more and more tired

515
00:27:12,898 --> 00:27:15,165
      and the treatments were
      harder and harder on her.

516
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:19,003
              It was, uh...

517

521
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:42,660

526
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:55,372

 to be in show business
 when you die

527
00:27:55,374 --> 00:27:58,242

            there were many,
            many people there,

530
00:28:03,816 --> 00:28:06,884
       but, to me, it was
       some kind of production.

 I think in retrospect,
 after Mum died,

533
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:21,965
  Dad was depressed.

534

  <i>as he always does,</i>

536
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:32,476

  <i>be playing solitaire</i>

539

542
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:51,995
            <i>It was sort of like</i>

555
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:32,336
   The next few years

00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:47,571
   Anyways, years later,
   when I was in my 20s,

596
00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:50,007
  you know,
  long after Mom had died,

597
00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:54,278
    Anne Tate mentioned
    something about
    somebody in Montreal

598
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,147
   when Mum
   was in Montreal
   for that period of time.

599
00:31:57,149 --> 00:31:59,616
   Johnny once led me

600
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:01,385
  into talking about that,

601
00:32:01,387 --> 00:32:05,422
    <i>because I think I was</i>
    <i>quite tight-lipped about it.</i>

602
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:10,961
    <i>I thought that this actor</i>
    <i>in the play might have</i>
    <i>been the father.</i>

603
00:32:10,963 --> 00:32:13,430
  Your father, (CHUCKLING)
  let's say it.

604
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:17,534
    <i>It makes it sound</i>
    <i>as if she was</i>
    <i>terribly promiscuous,</i>

605
00:32:17,536 --> 00:32:20,370
     <i>which, in fact,</i>
     <i>I don't think she was.</i>

606
00:32:20,372 --> 00:32:23,974
  <i>But I think she did consider</i>

607
00:32:23,976 --> 00:32:27,511
    that it was possible
    that it could be
    this other guy.

608
00:32:27,513 --> 00:32:32,616
          <i>because we used to</i>
          <i>often have dinner</i>
          <i>together on weekends,</i>

609
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:35,519
         <i>probably Johnny started</i>
         <i>by saying,</i>

610
00:32:35,521 --> 00:32:37,354
        "You don't look
        much like your father."

611
00:32:37,356 --> 00:32:38,689
         I think it was Johnny.

612
00:32:38,691 --> 00:32:40,390
             I want to say
             it was Johnny.

613
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:42,492
      And, actually now,
      in retrospect that I know

614
00:32:42,494 --> 00:32:45,262
      that Johnny was the first
      of us who knew,
      it must have been Johnny.

615
00:32:45,264 --> 00:32:49,399
   I stupidly mentioned it
   to Mark, I thought.

616
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:51,501
     (LAUGHING) Um...

617
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:58,075
 Uh, my lawyer has said
 I don't have to
 talk to you and so...

618
00:32:58,077 --> 00:33:00,410
    I'm not gonna say
    anything more.
    (CHUCKLING)

619
00:33:00,412 --> 00:33:03,613
  <i>I remember Johnny saying</i>

627
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:22,132
        and Dad joked about it.

628
00:33:22,134 --> 00:33:24,201
              I always thought,

        "She does look like me,

 Well, it depends on

 I would think.

 I mean, it was Geoff Bowes.

00:34:25,097 --> 00:34:27,130
 The thinking was that
 it was Geoff Bowes.

650
00:34:27,132 --> 00:34:29,466
            There was, I guess,
            an actor named
            Geoff Bowes.

651
00:34:29,468 --> 00:34:31,568
  Geoff Bowes. (LAUGHING)

        Geoff Bowes!

00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:43,513
     Johnny pretended,
     that she'd mentioned

655
00:34:43,515 --> 00:34:47,150
 Geoff Bowes and an affair
 with him and so I said,

656
00:34:47,152 --> 00:34:52,089
    "Oh, well, okay.
    I'll tell you.

665
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:18,215

 Uh, it was friendship.

786

  <i>When the play was over,</i>

 I still had certain reserves

792

  <i>my geriatric bar, the Troika.</i>

795
00:42:08,093 --> 00:42:11,094
  <i>I ordered a drink</i>

  <i>schmaltzy Russian trio,</i>

   <i>"Oh, my God."</i>

799

   <i>kind of separate Diane.</i>

808

811
00:42:50,035 --> 00:42:53,803
   <i>and there was a very strong</i>
   <i>mutual attraction.</i>

812
00:42:53,805 --> 00:42:56,606
 Very, very powerful thing.

813
00:42:56,608 --> 00:42:59,175

           You know, bound back

820
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:15,091
          "Okay." And then run
          back down the stairs.

00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:20,730
     DEIRDRE: <i>Harry developed</i>

829
00:43:43,822 --> 00:43:45,989

848
00:44:39,878 --> 00:44:41,110
           <i>I was quite stunned.</i>

849
00:44:41,112 --> 00:44:43,179
         Nobody before had ever

850
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:47,250
             come right out
             and said that.

851
00:44:47,252 --> 00:44:50,853
     <i>I think certainly</i>
     <i>I began to think</i>
     <i>through this conversation.</i>

852
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:53,122
 <i>"Yeah, they're probably right.</i>

855
00:45:00,065 --> 00:45:01,798

856
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,168

857
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:07,403
        <i>Well, Diane had probably</i>

858
00:45:07,405 --> 00:45:09,305
           <i>That she was thinking</i>

 Before she went back
 to Toronto,

862
00:45:23,188 --> 00:45:26,989
 uh, I asked her
 to move to Montreal
 and to bring her kids here.

863
00:45:26,991 --> 00:45:29,258
  <i>It was complex and difficult.</i>

864
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:33,296
  <i>She had this passionate</i>

  <i>and to her husband</i>

865
00:45:33,298 --> 00:45:37,767

   <i>attachment to me.</i>

866
00:45:37,769 --> 00:45:40,470

868

00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:27,917
 SARAH: Did she talk at all

882

885

888
00:46:54,813 --> 00:46:56,445

  up and down a little bit,
  you know?

895
00:47:12,497 --> 00:47:15,565

 you never can both equally

1005
00:53:39,417 --> 00:53:42,551

00:53:45,456 --> 00:53:50,726
  <i>What she communicated to me,</i>
  <i>what I got from her</i>
  <i>was almost a thrill.</i>

1008
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:53,729
  <i>So in terms of</i>

1010
00:53:57,768 --> 00:54:01,237
  <i>I thought that would help me</i>

  <i>in my pursuit.</i>

1011
00:54:01,239 --> 00:54:04,373
   <i>I mean, quite apart from</i>
   <i>the anticipation of a child,</i>

1012
00:54:04,375 --> 00:54:09,478
 I felt, well, this is
 a quiver in my bow,
 you know? (CHUCKLES)

1013
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,781
 I mean, we have sort of
 more than an affair
 to deal with,

1014
00:54:12,783 --> 00:54:14,950
    we have a child.

1015
00:54:14,952 --> 00:54:19,989
  <i>she sent me that picture</i>
  <i>holding you</i>
  <i>as a tiny infant.</i>

1016
00:54:19,991 --> 00:54:23,525
  <i>And then she sent me</i>
  <i>a picture by yourself</i>
  <i>when you were one year old.</i>

1017
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:31,300
  <i>Subsequently,</i>

  <i>to Toronto quite frequently,</i>

1018
00:54:31,302 --> 00:54:33,569
   <i>so I was there quite often</i>
   <i>and I would see Diane.</i>

1019
00:54:33,571 --> 00:54:36,739
   <i>She would come to Montreal</i>
   <i>reasonably often.</i>

1020
00:54:36,741 --> 00:54:39,441
   <i>Diane would introduce me</i>
   <i>to all her friends,</i>

1021
00:54:39,443 --> 00:54:42,044
   <i>so our affair was</i>
   <i>a pretty open thing,</i>

1022
00:54:42,046 --> 00:54:44,580
   <i>because you need that, too,</i>
   <i>and somehow you want that</i>

1023
00:54:44,582 --> 00:54:47,750
   <i>in terms of a love affair,</i>

1024
00:54:47,752 --> 00:54:50,686
 You need witnesses
 which, sort of, confirm you.

1025
00:54:50,688 --> 00:54:53,622
 I think it was...
 It was very discreet.

1026
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:57,493
      <i>I don't think it was</i>
      <i>really common knowledge.</i>

1027

1028
00:54:59,864 --> 00:55:01,830
          <i>but nobody ever</i>

1029
00:55:01,832 --> 00:55:04,800
        I told her I would
        never discuss it with
        anyone and I never did.

1030
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:10,306
          I promised,
          and she was my buddy,

1031
00:55:10,308 --> 00:55:13,442
     and there was no way
     on God's earth
     I was gonna talk about it.

1032
00:55:13,444 --> 00:55:15,311

  HARRY: <i>So there was</i>
   <i>this strange situation</i>

   <i>of an ongoing affair</i>

1044
00:56:08,032 --> 00:56:10,065

1045
00:56:10,067 --> 00:56:13,469
   <i>I think that she had</i>

1049

 But on the other hand,
 to some degree, intensified it

1050
00:56:24,749 --> 00:56:28,717
  <i>because, you know,</i>

  a bit of a...

       An echo.

  <i>I felt constrained,</i>

1525

   <i>It's just creating problems.</i>

      about having it published
      that attracted you?

1537
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:10,264
  Well, I think...

1538
01:21:10,266 --> 01:21:12,466
 I think anyone
 who writes anything,

1539
01:21:12,468 --> 01:21:17,872
 I mean, anyone who does
 anything, wants to
 bring it out to a public.

1540
01:21:17,874 --> 01:21:20,274
  I mean, if there's
  a story to be told,

1541
01:21:20,276 --> 01:21:24,211
  and if the story
  has some validity
  and some resonance,

1542
01:21:24,213 --> 01:21:26,513

   <i>I'm sure there's</i>

 the point of view of
 everyone who is alive

     SARAH: So, what do you
     think of the concept of me
     making this documentary

1583
01:23:44,687 --> 01:23:49,156
     where we're sort of giving
     equal weight to everyone's
     version of the story?

1584
01:23:49,158 --> 01:23:51,258
  I don't like it.

1585
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:53,127
   (STUTTERING)
   I think that

1586
01:23:54,329 --> 01:23:55,562
 takes us into a...

1587
01:23:56,765 --> 01:23:59,066
 Into a very wooly...

1588
01:23:59,068 --> 01:24:02,669
 Like, you see, you can't
 ever touch bottom
 with anything, then.

1589
01:24:02,671 --> 01:24:05,272
 We're all over the place.

1590
01:24:05,274 --> 01:24:07,174
   I think they can
   all be heard.

1591
01:24:07,176 --> 01:24:10,477
 It's giving them equal
 weight, which I find...

1592
01:24:10,479 --> 01:24:13,547
 Particularly those
 who are non-players.

1593
01:24:13,549 --> 01:24:17,317
  <i>First of all,</i>
  <i>there are the parties</i>
  <i>to an incident.</i>

1594
01:24:17,319 --> 01:24:20,754
  <i>Those who were there</i>
  <i>and who were directly</i>
  <i>affected by it.</i>

1595
01:24:20,756 --> 01:24:23,257
   <i>Then, there is</i>
   <i>a circle around that,</i>

1596
01:24:23,259 --> 01:24:26,093
   <i>of people who are</i>
   <i>affected tangentially</i>

1597
01:24:26,095 --> 01:24:29,430
  <i>because of their</i>
  <i>relationship to</i>
  <i>the principal parties.</i>

1598
01:24:29,432 --> 01:24:32,833
  <i>And then, there's</i>
  <i>another concentric circle,</i>
  <i>further out there,</i>

1599
01:24:32,835 --> 01:24:34,835
   <i>which, basically,</i>
   <i>has heard or been told</i>

1600
01:24:34,837 --> 01:24:37,137
   <i>by one of the principal</i>
   <i>players about it.</i>

1601
01:24:37,139 --> 01:24:40,274
 All of these may have
 different narratives

1602
01:24:40,276 --> 01:24:42,443
 and these narratives

1603
01:24:42,445 --> 01:24:44,645
 are shaped in part
 by their relationship

1604
01:24:44,647 --> 01:24:47,714
 to the person
 who told it to them,
 and by the events.

1605
01:24:47,716 --> 01:24:49,683
    <i>One does not</i>
    <i>get the truth</i>

1606
01:24:49,685 --> 01:24:52,286
   <i>simply by hearing</i>
   <i>what their reactions are.</i>

1607
01:24:52,288 --> 01:24:54,521
    <i>People tend to</i>
    <i>declare themselves</i>

1608
01:24:54,523 --> 01:24:56,757
   <i>in terms of what</i>
   <i>they saw, in terms</i>
   <i>of what they felt.</i>

1609
01:24:56,759 --> 01:24:58,625
    <i>In terms of what</i>
    <i>they remembered,</i>

1610
01:24:58,627 --> 01:25:00,594
    <i>and in terms of</i>
    <i>their loyalties.</i>

1611
01:25:00,596 --> 01:25:03,297
    <i>The same</i>
    <i>set of circumstances</i>

1612
01:25:03,299 --> 01:25:06,433
    <i>will affect</i>
    <i>different people</i>
    <i>in different ways.</i>

1613
01:25:06,435 --> 01:25:08,402
    <i>Not that there are</i>
    <i>different truths,</i>

1614
01:25:08,404 --> 01:25:11,205
   <i>there are</i>
   <i>different reactions</i>
   <i>to particular events.</i>

1615
01:25:13,141 --> 01:25:15,442
  The crucial
  function of art is
  to tell the truth.

1616
01:25:15,444 --> 01:25:18,278
 To find the truth
 in a situation.
 That's what it's about.

1617
01:25:21,583 --> 01:25:24,718
       You realize, when you've
       finished all this...

1618
01:25:27,856 --> 01:25:31,158
       You realize, when you've
       finished all this,

1619
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:35,529
            you've got about
            six hours of stuff.

1620
01:25:35,531 --> 01:25:39,266
       And you'll decide
       what you want out of it.

1621
01:25:39,268 --> 01:25:41,235
               It'll be exactly
               like the story.

1622
01:25:41,237 --> 01:25:43,804
               Each one of us
               will pick out...

1623
01:25:43,806 --> 01:25:46,140
         If any one of us
         were trying to edit it

1624
01:25:46,142 --> 01:25:49,309
             and decide what
             we wanted to keep,

1625
01:25:49,311 --> 01:25:54,781
  it would be the same farcical
  kind of theatrical exercise
  that we're all involved in.

1626
01:25:54,783 --> 01:25:56,550
     <i>"Oh, I want to keep that."</i>

1627
01:25:56,552 --> 01:25:58,385
                <i>"Oh, no, that's</i>
                <i>rubbish, there."</i>

1628
01:25:58,387 --> 01:26:00,821
            <i>That's an enormously</i>
            <i>different thing</i>

1629
01:26:00,823 --> 01:26:03,590
           <i>from simply doing</i>
           <i>an interview straight</i>

1630
01:26:03,592 --> 01:26:06,693
       <i>and never doing any</i>
       <i>editing of it whatsoever,</i>

1631
01:26:06,695 --> 01:26:08,529
                  <i>but letting it</i>
                  <i>run as it is.</i>

1632
01:26:08,531 --> 01:26:12,699
          That would have been
          at least as close to
          truth as you can get,

1633
01:26:12,701 --> 01:26:15,335
                whereas your
                editing of this

1634
01:26:15,337 --> 01:26:18,672
           will turn this into
           something completely
           different.

1635
01:26:18,674 --> 01:26:20,807
  What would you say,
  this documentary is
  really about?
