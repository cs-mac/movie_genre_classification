All right! No more X`s and O`s. OK?

Sixteen. There`s 1 6 minutes

We should hang out tonight.
Get to know each other or something.

I just gotta grab the championship
trophy I left it in my truck.

So, another top-secret hiding place?

You`re the second girl l`ve had up here.

150
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,816
The first was my mom.

151
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,853
She only climbed up here to get me down.

I bet he`s already got
your name on a locker.

158
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:41,471
It`s always been my dad`s dream. Now
l`m going to end up at his alma mater.

159
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:45,614
Did I just say that?

160
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,786
My mom and I have been talking about
Stanford pretty much since I was born.

161
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:56,191
And you`re already in. That`s so cool.

162
00:09:58,597 --> 00:10:02,124
Except she won`t stop talking
about it. It`s embarrassing.

163
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:04,431
Come on. She`s proud of you.

164
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:07,937
I`m proud of you.

165
00:10:10,275 --> 00:10:13,210
The thing about Stanford
is it`s a thousand and fifty...

166
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:15,269
...fifty-three miles from here.

167
00:10:17,349 --> 00:10:18,680
I know.

168
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:26,649
It suddenly seems like the rest
of the school year is coming so fast.

169
00:10:26,725 --> 00:10:29,626
Yeah. I wish it would all just stop.

170
00:10:32,297 --> 00:10:33,958
At least just slow down.

171
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:47,572
! Can you imagine what would happen

172
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:50,308
! if we could have any dream?

173
00:10:52,017 --> 00:10:56,113
! i`d wish this moment
was ours to own it

174
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:59,680
! And that it would never leave

175
00:10:59,758 --> 00:11:02,659
! Then i would thank that star

176
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:05,925
! That made our wish come true

177
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,296
! Oh, yeah

178
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:11,734
! `Cause he knows that where you are

179
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:15,740
! is where i should be too

180
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:21,243
! Right here

181
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:25,979
! Right now

182
00:11:26,051 --> 00:11:28,542
-! Right now
-! i`m looking at you

183
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,350
! And my heart loves the view

184
00:11:31,423 --> 00:11:35,792
-! `Cause you mean everything
-! Everything

185
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,989
! Right here

186
00:11:39,064 --> 00:11:42,795
! i promise you somehow

187
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,699
! Somehow we`re gonna

188
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:49,173
! Tomorrow can wait
for some other day to be

189
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:54,645
! To be, but right now
there`s you and me

190
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:57,580
! Oh, we know it`s coming

191
00:11:57,649 --> 00:11:59,742
! And it`s coming fast

192
00:11:59,818 --> 00:12:03,276
! it`s always you and me

193
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:07,291
-! So let`s make every second last
- [giggles]

194
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:10,988
! Make it last

195
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,657
! `Cause right here

196
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,959
! Right now

197
00:12:19,037 --> 00:12:21,130
! Yeah, i`m looking at you

198
00:12:21,206 --> 00:12:23,640
! And my heart loves the view

199
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:28,169
! `Cause you mean everything

200
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:31,239
! Right here

201
00:12:31,316 --> 00:12:36,413
! i promise you somehow

202
00:12:36,488 --> 00:12:38,547
! That tomorrow can wait

203
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:41,593
! For some other day to be

204
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:46,620
! To be, but right now
there`s you and me

205
00:12:46,698 --> 00:12:50,156
-! You and me
-! You and me

206
00:12:50,235 --> 00:12:51,600
! You and me

207
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,194
! But right now there`s

208
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:59,268
! You and me!

209
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:11,617
Is this a pirate`s wheel?

210
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:12,679
No.

211
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:15,289
[laughs]

212
00:13:16,094 --> 00:13:17,459
Very cute.

213
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:19,258
I haven`t played
with Robo-Rob since third grade.

214
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:22,425
- l`m Robo-Rob. I am...
- Don`t break him. Don`t break him.

215
00:13:26,004 --> 00:13:28,029
- That`s Chad`s.
- Sure it is.

216
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:33,676
Now it`s just like kindergarten.

217
00:13:33,745 --> 00:13:36,009
Troy? You have guests.

218
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:40,142
Don`t make me come up there
and get you again. Hi, Gabriella.

219
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,020
We`ll be right down, Mom.

220
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:49,383
She really will come up here
if we don`t go down.

221
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:51,224
Oh, OK.

222
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:04,839
Right there, right there. OK,
come on through. Come on. There you go.

223
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:27,425
[sighs]

224
00:14:30,335 --> 00:14:31,324
Wow.

225
00:14:35,607 --> 00:14:37,871
[whistles]

226
00:14:40,712 --> 00:14:42,202
Hey, Troy.

227
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:44,078
So, when`s the big game?

228
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:45,639
[cell phone rings]

229
00:14:45,717 --> 00:14:47,150
Uh, yesterday.

230
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:50,315
Oh, well. Good luck.

231
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,918
- Wow.
- She`s so sweet.

232
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:01,257
[boy gasps]

233
00:15:23,021 --> 00:15:25,319
What are you? I mean, who are you?

234
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:28,791
Good morning, Ms. Evans. I`m Tiara Gold.

235
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,851
I transferred
to East High from London

236
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:34,228
and I noticed on the board you`re
in need of a personal assistant.

237
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,201
Yeah, with finals, prom, graduation,

238
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:40,363
I need someone tracking
my appointments and assignments.

239
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,931
Most important, I need someone
to run lines for the musical.

240
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:48,742
- That`s a theater term for...
- Learning your role. I understand.

241
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:51,476
It`s best to keep
science and math books together,

242
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,041
since those are
first lessons of the day.

243
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,984
How do you know my schedule?

244
00:15:56,054 --> 00:15:59,182
I took the liberty of checking,
simply to make certain

245
00:15:59,257 --> 00:16:03,489
I`d have your nonfat, no-foam,
soy latte ready for free period.

246
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:05,860
- One packet of sweetener?
- Organic.

247
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:14,135
I`ll e-mail you my wardrobe choices each
morning so that our outfits won`t clash.

248
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:16,674
If you own any orange, get rid of it.

249
00:16:19,544 --> 00:16:22,012
By the way, like the accent.

250
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,514
It`s... sweet.

251
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:34,291
Troy, my brother.
Can I have your gym locker?

252
00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:36,759
- What?
- Like starting next week.

253
00:16:36,828 --> 00:16:41,094
I`ll be running the team next season
and it`ll help me out with the guys.

254
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,693
- Yeah, why didn`t I think of that?
- I don`t know.

255
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,260
[school bell rings]

256
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,067
Tardy again. Later, bro!

257
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,769
Are you serious?

258
00:16:50,842 --> 00:16:52,833
What about her... Hey.

259
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,547
All right, everyone. Settle down.

260
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:02,314
We are all excited about our Wildcats`

261
00:17:02,387 --> 00:17:06,414
- top-to-bottom championships.
- That would be ``back-to-back.``

262
00:17:06,491 --> 00:17:10,086
Whatever the case,
it was a grand slam. Well done!

263
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:13,563
And our student body president
and co-editor of the yearbook,

264
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:16,567
Taylor McKessie,
has important announcements.

265
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:20,662
Senior trip committee meets tomorrow
and reports Thursday to prom committee,

266
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:23,367
headed by Martha.
Pick up your tickets from her.

267
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:26,969
This year`s theme is ``The Last Waltz.``

268
00:17:27,045 --> 00:17:28,979
But don`t be last to pick up tickets.

269
00:17:29,047 --> 00:17:32,983
Graduation committee convenes Monday.
Picture deadline is Thursday

270
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:36,646
and finals study groups alternate
with all of the above. Questions?

271
00:17:36,721 --> 00:17:39,189
What`s the lunch special
in the cafeteria?

272
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,824
New York deli. Anyone else?

273
00:17:43,895 --> 00:17:49,424
Moving on. Ms. Sharpay Evans, four-term
president of the drama club,

274
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,230
spring musicale report.

275
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:54,602
Well, with prom, finals,
everyone is so busy.

276
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:57,699
I was thinking
l`d select something modest.

277
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:00,074
Perhaps even a one-woman show.

278
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:06,283
A little light on the sign-ups, Kelsi?

279
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:09,445
No. We`re actually doing pretty well.

280
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:14,990
Well, well, well.
Almost the entire homeroom.

281
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,527
[Sharpay groans]

282
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,460
How inspiring!

283
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:22,967
I will happily see all of you
at free period to discuss the show

284
00:18:23,034 --> 00:18:26,162
and to make a very special announcement.

285
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:29,071
[school bell rings]

286
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:32,833
[chattering]

287
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:46,122
I`ll be retaking my finals two or three
times. I`m moving into the library.

288
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:48,022
I`m working on my truck every day.

289
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:50,584
I`ve got five recipes
for Family Science final.

290
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:52,630
We`ve got a yearbook to edit, so no.

291
00:18:52,697 --> 00:18:56,793
Sorry! Jeez. I thought since it was the
last show, everyone would want to do it.

292
00:18:56,868 --> 00:19:00,201
- You`re wrong.
- We just don`t have time.

293
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:04,800
Hey. Hey, you guys, listen up.
Kelsi`s right. We should do this.

294
00:19:04,876 --> 00:19:07,640
This is our last chance
to do something together.

295
00:19:07,712 --> 00:19:10,306
All of us. Something really fun.

296
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:11,849
Oh, yippee.

297
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:15,716
So, what do you say, Wildcats?

298
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:17,812
No, I still don`t think
it`s a good idea.

299
00:19:17,889 --> 00:19:21,222
- Guys, come on! It`s our senior year!
- Troy.

300
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:26,989
We`re all in this together.
This is our senior year.

301
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:28,589
I`m in.

302
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:31,363
What?

303
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:33,199
- It will be fun.
- Yes!

304
00:19:33,271 --> 00:19:36,240
- Oh, boy.
- How much time will it take?

305
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,674
Yeah. And what the heck
is the show about?

306
00:19:38,743 --> 00:19:40,370
You, Mr. Danforth.

307
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:43,036
Me?

308
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:49,279
The spring musicale is all about you.

309
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:57,289
Hold up. If it`s about me, then
can I have my ball back? Please?

310
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:01,261
- lt`s about all of you.
- Go!

311
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,130
And all of you will create it.

312
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:08,639
A show about your final days at
East High. We`ll call it Senior Year.

313
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,572
Genius.

314
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:13,634
Uh-uh-uh! Playing a role is easy,

315
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,476
but being yourself,
now that`s a challenge.

316
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,038
Miss Darbus, exactly...

317
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:20,812
Kelsi will compose,
Ryan will choreograph

318
00:20:20,885 --> 00:20:23,376
- and I will direct.
- Thank you.

319
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:28,119
Now, I have
some very important news from...

320
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:32,995
...the Juilliard School
in New York City,

321
00:20:33,064 --> 00:20:36,795
America`s preeminent college
for the performing arts.

322
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:40,395
And for the first time
in East High history,

323
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:43,805
Juilliard is considering four of you

324
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,605
for one available scholarship.

325
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:49,704
- Miss Sharpay Evans.
- l`m already packed.

326
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:52,807
- Mr. Ryan Evans.
- Dance.

327
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:56,115
- Miss Kelsi Nielsen.
- What? They got my letter?

328
00:20:56,187 --> 00:20:57,711
They certainly did.

329
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:02,226
And, lastly, Mr. Troy Bolton.

330
00:21:02,293 --> 00:21:04,420
What?

331
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:09,433
Juilliard will be sending
representatives to observe our show.

332
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:16,370
So good luck to our four applicants.

333
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,706
Yeah, nice. Nice, guys.
That`s pretty funny.

334
00:21:20,945 --> 00:21:23,607
So... who`s the big comedian?

335
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:28,779
- Is there something wrong?
- Yeah. Yeah, I didn`t apply.

336
00:21:28,853 --> 00:21:33,381
- l`ve never heard of Juilliard.
- Well, that may be, Mr. Bolton,

337
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:37,258
but evidently Juilliard
has heard of you.

338
00:21:37,328 --> 00:21:41,094
And as you create this show,
you must dig deep

339
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:45,569
and think about your aspirations
and dreams for the future.

340
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,400
Line up, downstage, please.

341
00:21:50,975 --> 00:21:54,638
Let`s begin with Mr. Danforth.
Step forward, please.

342
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,609
Your future.

343
00:21:57,682 --> 00:22:00,810
It`s easy. It`s U of A.
Hoops all the way.

344
00:22:00,885 --> 00:22:04,685
- Yeah.
- Miss McKessie.

345
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:07,657
I`m going to be the President
of the United States.

346
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:08,750
Oh.

347
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,318
I`m going to finish
college first, of course.

348
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,327
Martha Cox, you`re late.

349
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:17,732
I`m sorry, I just thought maybe
we could use a few more dancers.

350
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:24,139
[group gasps, chuckles]

351
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:27,110
I feel a show coming on already!

352
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:36,820
Mr. Bolton.

353
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:40,182
- Mr. Bolton.
- Hmm?

354
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:43,318
- Your future.
- Oh, yeah, uh...

355
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:49,798
You know... uh...

356
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,392
I`ve been thinking about...

357
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,067
Uh...

358
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:01,601
I think we should stage
the perfect prom.

359
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,445
Golly gee, how adorable.
What do I want?

360
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:08,418
Gosh, I wouldn`t know
where to begin.

361
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,613
But I know where it ends.

362
00:23:11,689 --> 00:23:13,281
Center stage.

363
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:16,454
A single spotlight.

364
00:23:18,863 --> 00:23:22,390
A huge marquee that reads...

365
00:23:36,147 --> 00:23:37,910
New York deli platter, please.

366
00:23:37,982 --> 00:23:41,543
- How can you think about food?
- Maybe because it`s lunch time?

367
00:23:41,619 --> 00:23:44,213
No pickles.
Throw that Big Apple parfait in.

368
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:46,780
OK, this show is our last shot, Ryan.

369
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:52,885
Sharpay`s meal, please.
Thanks. That`s great.

370
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:55,956
Troy pretended
to know nothing about Juilliard.

371
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:58,559
- Give me a break.
- He seemed surprised to me.

372
00:23:58,636 --> 00:24:02,231
The theater fairy magically
sent in Troy`s application?

373
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:06,334
Performers can`t fool me. They`re
deceitful, ambitious and ruthless.

374
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:09,209
- Aren`t we performers?
- Exactly.

375
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,207
- Hmm.

How?

Polish her glasses, buy her some
ruby slippers, take her to prom.

00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:10,946
I don`t know.

470
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:13,377
Just do it.

471
00:29:23,427 --> 00:29:25,361
- Hey, Tay.
- Morning, Sunshine.

472
00:29:25,429 --> 00:29:28,193
- You going to rehearsals today?
- Uh, do I have a choice?

473
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:32,032
You got us into this. I don`t
understand. You might not be here.

474
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:35,038
Told anyone you`re up for
Stanford`s Freshman Honors?

475
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,300
No.

476
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:38,205
You`re gonna hear from them any day.

00:29:39,777 --> 00:29:41,904
- Hello?
- Taylor, these things take time.

479
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:46,310
- Hey.
- [Troy] i need you right away.

480
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:47,817
- What?
- Look up.

481
00:29:52,156 --> 00:29:53,384
I have to go.

482
00:29:53,457 --> 00:29:56,017
This has two weeks detention
written all over it.

483
00:29:58,429 --> 00:29:59,760
Have fun.

484
00:30:05,636 --> 00:30:07,695
I really need your help.

485
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:10,104
Which one do you think I should wear?

486
00:30:10,174 --> 00:30:12,904
Because?

487
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:18,210
Because you`re going to have
a pretty dress, so I want to look right.

488
00:30:18,282 --> 00:30:22,912
I`ve never been asked to a prom, but
this almost sounds like an invitation.

489
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,318
This one.

490
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:33,423
I`ve never been to a dance,
much less a prom.

491
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:40,836
But I was hoping these
might be a good start.

492
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:49,744
Do you think we`re going
to have to waltz?

493
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:52,612
Because I have no idea how to do that.

494
00:30:52,683 --> 00:30:56,050
All I know is what my dad
taught me when I was a little girl.

495
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:59,351
I`d stand on his toes, and he`d
waltz me around the living room.

496
00:31:00,891 --> 00:31:02,722
Come here. I`ll show you.

Perfect timing, Bolton.

We weren`t just given these lockers.
We had to earn them.

- Bold choice, gentlemen.

We all must have the courage
to discover ourselves.

576
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,699
However, at East High,

577
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:23,873
we will discover ourselves
whilst clothed.

You think l`d be spending any time
at all up there if it wasn`t for you?

- What?
- You`re so good.

I watch you in rehearsals. You love it.

594
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:20,902
Why is that so hard for you to admit?

595
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:24,340
It isn`t, to you.

596
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:29,607
But to my dad? To Chad?
Yeah, it`s a little hard.

597
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,272
It shouldn`t be.

we`re all talking about U of A.

You chose Stanford. U of A
was sort of chosen for me.

I haven`t talked
to anybody about this, but...

- I get it, Troy.

I still have decisions to make, too.

some snacks inside. Are you guys hungry?

- Just talking, Mom.

- Homework.
- OK.

after school to check out that tuxedo?

``Understudy`` isn`t a role, you moron.

of water on Earth.

I wouldn`t sing with you
if I were starving

the last pickle at the picnic.

- They select only 30 freshmen

784
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:34,940
from the entire incoming class. It`s
a special three-weeks Honor program.

How prestigious.

Hey, the boys are back

937
00:58:07,423 --> 00:58:09,983
! The boys are back
Gonna do it again

938
00:58:10,059 --> 00:58:11,856
! And we make it look good

939
00:58:11,928 --> 00:58:15,864
! The boys are back
Yeah, the boys are back

940
00:58:15,932 --> 00:58:18,162
! Tearing down the walls
any time we want

941
00:58:18,234 --> 00:58:20,395
! i`m sure that you know by now

942
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:25,168
! The boys are back!

943
00:58:32,949 --> 00:58:35,179
What are you gonna do
if Juilliard says yes?

944
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:41,112
- I don`t know.
- That`s not what I wanted to hear.

945
00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:44,057
I`m getting your butt back
in the gym tomorrow. Got me?

946
00:58:44,126 --> 00:58:45,684
So I can whup your butt?

947
00:58:45,761 --> 00:58:48,958
- Dream on.
- With my eyes closed.

What`s up, man?

00:59:12,788 --> 00:59:14,813
- Hi, Troy!
- [gasps]

953
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:17,723
I realized I haven`t
offered my congratulations.

954
00:59:17,793 --> 00:59:21,752
Oh, thank you.
I`m glad the season`s over, so...

955
00:59:21,831 --> 00:59:25,096
I didn`t mean basketball, silly!
I meant Gabriella.

956
00:59:25,167 --> 00:59:26,964
- What?
- Her missing the show

957
00:59:27,036 --> 00:59:31,473
is a little disappointing, but being
selected for Stanford`s Honors Program,

958
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:34,100
that is amazing for her
and for East High.

959
00:59:34,176 --> 00:59:36,872
I don`t know what you`re talking about.

960
00:59:36,946 --> 00:59:40,006
Everyone else does.
The whole school`s buzzing.

961
00:59:40,082 --> 00:59:44,849
The honorees spend time with Stanford`s
top professors starting next week.

962
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:46,751
- Next week?
- Look, right there.

963
00:59:47,857 --> 00:59:49,085
You really didn`t know?

964
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:53,561
OK, this is a little awkward.

965
00:59:53,629 --> 00:59:58,225
I guess her not telling you means
that she`s on the fence about it.

966
00:59:58,301 --> 01:00:02,863
But who better than Troy Bolton to
encourage her to accept the honor?

967
01:00:02,938 --> 01:00:07,932
Since the only thing possibly
holding her back would be... you.

968
01:00:10,479 --> 01:00:12,777
Well, l`ll see you at rehearsal.
Toodles.

[cell phone rings]

970
01:00:29,231 --> 01:00:30,425
Hello?

971
01:00:30,499 --> 01:00:33,297
Hello. Somebody order a pizza pie?

972
01:00:33,369 --> 01:00:36,566
- I didn`t order a pizza.
- Special delivery!

973
01:00:39,075 --> 01:00:40,474
Margherita pizza!

974
01:00:40,543 --> 01:00:42,010
Shh.

975
01:00:42,778 --> 01:00:44,746
Just the way you like it.

976
01:00:44,814 --> 01:00:46,281
Let`s not forget,

977
01:00:46,349 --> 01:00:50,308
what`s a picnic without
chocolate-covered strawberries?

978
01:00:50,386 --> 01:00:51,648
It wouldn`t be right.

979
01:00:59,628 --> 01:01:01,323
Do you want the last strawberry?

980
01:01:02,865 --> 01:01:04,423
Hmm...

981
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:08,596
Come on. This might very well be the
best strawberry in the whole world,

982
01:01:08,671 --> 01:01:11,231
you wouldn`t know
because you`re not gonna eat it.

983
01:01:12,775 --> 01:01:13,935
Fine, then.

984
01:01:16,412 --> 01:01:17,879
Mmm!

985
01:01:20,383 --> 01:01:21,543
You were right.

986
01:01:27,390 --> 01:01:28,652
So here`s the thing.

987
01:01:31,193 --> 01:01:33,127
Your Honors Program at Stanford...

988
01:01:33,195 --> 01:01:37,188
- How did you hear about that?
- A lot of people heard about it.

989
01:01:37,266 --> 01:01:41,202
But I wasn`t one of them. Why?

990
01:01:41,270 --> 01:01:43,295
Because I knew what you would say.

991
01:01:43,372 --> 01:01:46,364
Of course you should do
the Honors Program.

992
01:01:46,442 --> 01:01:49,934
Is that what you were trying to tell me?
In the backyard the other day?

993
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:52,077
One of the things.

994
01:01:52,982 --> 01:01:54,347
What else?

995
01:01:54,417 --> 01:01:57,511
I`ve been thinking about trying
to talk my mom into staying

996
01:01:57,586 --> 01:02:01,283
in Albuquerque another year.
I`ll just take some classes here

997
01:02:01,357 --> 01:02:03,951
and go to Stanford when l`m ready.

998
01:02:04,026 --> 01:02:06,927
You can`t just put off something
as amazing as Stanford.

999
01:02:08,264 --> 01:02:10,255
You got to go. It`s the right thing.

1000
01:02:10,332 --> 01:02:14,598
I always do the right thing. Maybe
I want to be a little crazy this time.

1001
01:02:14,670 --> 01:02:18,868
Everything about my life has
always been full speed ahead.

1002
01:02:18,941 --> 01:02:22,934
I told you, I wish it
would all just slow down...

1003
01:02:23,913 --> 01:02:25,039
...to a stop.

1004
01:02:26,782 --> 01:02:28,773
We`re going to graduate.

1005
01:02:28,851 --> 01:02:31,843
That`s going to happen.
Nothing is going to slow down.

1006
01:02:34,757 --> 01:02:37,590
I guess my heart just doesn`t know
it`s in high school.

1007
01:02:40,463 --> 01:02:41,794
- Well...
- Shh.

1008
01:02:41,864 --> 01:02:44,662
You don`t have to say anything else.

1009
01:02:44,733 --> 01:02:47,827
I`m a lot better at goodbyes than you.

1010
01:02:47,903 --> 01:02:50,303
I`ve had a ton of practice.

1011
01:02:56,445 --> 01:02:59,278
Why are you saying goodbye?

1012
01:02:59,348 --> 01:03:01,839
We still have prom.
We still have to graduate.

1013
01:03:03,319 --> 01:03:04,650
I meant ``good night."`

1014
01:03:19,502 --> 01:03:21,766
- You OK?
- Yeah.

1015
01:03:24,073 --> 01:03:26,405
- Good night.
- Good night.

All right, everyone!
Attention, please! Listen up.

1054
01:06:07,736 --> 01:06:12,173
As some of you know, Miss Montez
is no longer available to us.

1055
01:06:12,241 --> 01:06:15,005
However, the show must indeed go on.

1056
01:06:15,077 --> 01:06:18,979
So, Sharpay, you will do
Gabriella`s duet with Troy.

1057
01:06:19,048 --> 01:06:21,107
Tiara, ready to step in for Sharpay?

1058
01:06:21,183 --> 01:06:24,118
Those sparkling shoes
are impossible to fill.

1059
01:06:24,186 --> 01:06:27,417
- Don`t worry. Kelsi will work with you.
- Hmm.

1060
01:06:29,391 --> 01:06:33,691
Come on, people. Let`s rise to
the occasion. We`re all pros here.

1061
01:06:33,762 --> 01:06:36,128
Let`s do it for Gabriella. OK?

1062
01:06:36,198 --> 01:06:39,031
Kelsi, Troy, Ryan. Play piano.

1063
01:06:40,202 --> 01:06:42,397
All right, we have a lot of work to do.

1064
01:06:42,471 --> 01:06:46,407
There are sets to paint.
Drill that second number. Let`s go!

1065
01:06:46,475 --> 01:06:48,306
Come on people, double time!

1066
01:07:09,965 --> 01:07:11,592
- Hey.
- Hey.

1067
01:07:11,667 --> 01:07:13,658
- lt`s late.
- Yeah.

1068
01:07:17,172 --> 01:07:18,400
Hear from Gabriella?

1069
01:07:19,341 --> 01:07:20,330
Yeah.

1070
01:07:21,643 --> 01:07:24,669
She`s knee-deep in geniuses out there.

1071
01:07:24,747 --> 01:07:27,773
Believe it or not, she says
the food`s better at East High.

1072
01:07:27,850 --> 01:07:30,580
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1073
01:07:30,652 --> 01:07:32,244
She still coming down for prom?

1074
01:07:33,322 --> 01:07:34,414
Yeah.

1075
01:07:40,395 --> 01:07:42,295
How`s that big show going?

1076
01:07:42,364 --> 01:07:43,695
You don`t want to know.

1077
01:07:49,505 --> 01:07:51,996
When were you going
to tell me about this?

1078
01:07:53,442 --> 01:07:54,534
Juilliard.

1079
01:07:57,546 --> 01:07:58,877
There`s nothing to tell.

1080
01:08:00,215 --> 01:08:01,842
Maybe there is.

1081
01:08:01,917 --> 01:08:05,614
I heard you`re talking to other schools.
I mean, is this serious?

1082
01:08:05,687 --> 01:08:09,088
U of A isn`t the only school
that`s talked to me. You know that.

1083
01:08:09,158 --> 01:08:11,558
But it`s the only school
we talked about.

1084
01:08:11,627 --> 01:08:14,255
Chad would be disappointed
if you changed your mind.

1085
01:08:14,329 --> 01:08:16,024
No, Chad would get over it.

1086
01:08:17,666 --> 01:08:19,964
Would you?

1087
01:08:20,035 --> 01:08:23,163
We`ve been going to U of A games
since you were a little kid.

1088
01:08:23,238 --> 01:08:25,832
You talked about wearing
a Redhawks uniform.

1089
01:08:25,908 --> 01:08:28,968
But l`m not a little kid anymore.

1090
01:08:29,044 --> 01:08:32,241
You raised me to make my own choices
and I need to make them.

01:08:33,482 --> 01:08:36,781
Not you or Chad or anybody else. Me.

1092
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:39,778
Hey.

1093
01:08:40,522 --> 01:08:43,320
Troy, come on. Troy!

! The echoes fill your soul

1097
01:09:55,163 --> 01:09:58,997
! They won`t say which way to go

1098
01:09:59,067 --> 01:10:01,729
! Just trust your heart

1099
01:10:04,039 --> 01:10:08,408
! To find what you`re here for

1100
01:10:08,477 --> 01:10:12,379
! Open another door

1101
01:10:12,447 --> 01:10:16,144
! But i`m not sure anymore

1102

! Aaah!!

1141
01:13:27,676 --> 01:13:30,804
Miss D?

1142
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:32,744
I know l`m not supposed to be here.

1143
01:13:32,814 --> 01:13:34,406
Aren`t you?

1144
01:13:34,483 --> 01:13:37,008
Nor should I be at this hour I suppose,

1145
01:13:37,085 --> 01:13:40,714
but I am trying to rebalance a show

1146
01:13:40,789 --> 01:13:44,816
in which Sharpay now plays
the role of Miss Montez.

1147
01:13:45,827 --> 01:13:47,658
And the reason for your visit is?

1148
01:13:49,297 --> 01:13:53,893
I don`t know. I think I feel
like this is a good place to...

1149
01:13:53,969 --> 01:13:59,236
- Scream? Feel free.
- Or just to think.

1150
01:13:59,307 --> 01:14:04,836
The stage can be a wonderful partner
in the process of self-discovery.

1151
01:14:04,913 --> 01:14:06,744
You seem comfortable up there.

1152
01:14:09,084 --> 01:14:11,052
I do?

1153
01:14:11,119 --> 01:14:16,455
Which is why I submitted an application
in your name to Juilliard.

1154
01:14:17,459 --> 01:14:18,926
It was you.

1155
01:14:18,994 --> 01:14:21,554
Better to consider opportunities now

1156
01:14:21,630 --> 01:14:25,498
than in ten years when life
may limit your choices.

1157
01:14:25,567 --> 01:14:27,501
If I overstepped, I apologize.

1158
01:14:28,403 --> 01:14:30,337
No. No, l`m not mad.

1159
01:14:32,974 --> 01:14:34,407
I`m just confused.

1160
01:14:35,944 --> 01:14:39,539
What a life in the theater
has taught me is

1161
01:14:39,614 --> 01:14:42,549
to trust one`s instincts.

1162
01:14:42,617 --> 01:14:47,554
And that takes courage.
A quality you don`t seem to lack.

1163
01:14:53,662 --> 01:14:55,630
Last one out turns off the lights.

1164
01:15:16,318 --> 01:15:18,752
So walk, walk, walk. Jump in.

1165
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:22,756
Around the world and spin out.
See? You got it.

1166
01:15:22,824 --> 01:15:25,418
- You`re easier to dance with than her.
- My turn.

1167
01:15:25,493 --> 01:15:27,358
OK. Here we go. From the top.

1168
01:15:27,429 --> 01:15:30,023
Walk, walk, walk.
Jump down. Around the world.

1169
01:15:30,098 --> 01:15:32,623
- Heads up! Heads up!
- [screams]

1170
01:15:34,236 --> 01:15:39,833
All right, everyone. Let`s just
take five, all right? Take five.

1171
01:15:39,908 --> 01:15:42,274
You two. House up.

1172
01:15:42,344 --> 01:15:45,279
[whistles] Hoops Man. Over here.

1173
01:15:45,347 --> 01:15:47,907
You look like you`re having
the time of your life.

1174
01:15:49,618 --> 01:15:53,679
I`m messing up the dances.
I`m messing up all the songs. I`m sorry.

1175
01:15:53,755 --> 01:15:56,121
It`s all of us.
And all of us pretty much know why.

1176
01:15:56,191 --> 01:16:00,287
If it wasn`t for Gabriella, this musical
would have been another ``Sharpay Show."`

1177
01:16:02,731 --> 01:16:04,494
- lt`ll be fine.
- Yeah.

1178
01:16:22,884 --> 01:16:25,284
- Hey, Mama!
- Hi.

1179
01:16:29,224 --> 01:16:30,486
Wow.

1180
01:16:31,993 --> 01:16:34,359
Gorgeous!

1181
01:16:34,429 --> 01:16:37,489
I`d like to take credit,
but Gabriella picked it out.

1182
01:16:37,565 --> 01:16:40,557
I ordered that corsage you showed me.
It`s going to be perfect.

1183
01:16:40,635 --> 01:16:42,330
- Thanks, Mom.
- [cell phone rings]

1184
01:16:42,404 --> 01:16:44,235
- You did good.
- Thank you.

1185
01:16:44,306 --> 01:16:45,534
It`s Gabriella.

1186
01:16:47,442 --> 01:16:49,842
Hey! I just showed my mom the tux.

1187
01:16:50,545 --> 01:16:51,876
We need to talk.

1188
01:16:53,882 --> 01:16:58,148
I can`t be a little adult right now,
Troy. I`m hoping you understand that.

1189
01:16:58,219 --> 01:17:00,050
No, don`t even say that.

1190
01:17:05,060 --> 01:17:07,085
Gabriella. Prom is in two days.

1191
01:17:07,162 --> 01:17:09,289
You`re supposed to be on a plane now.

1192
01:17:09,364 --> 01:17:12,629
It`s taking me two weeks to
get used to being away from you.

1193
01:17:12,701 --> 01:17:17,001
- From East High and all my friends.
- I know. I know.

1194
01:17:17,072 --> 01:17:20,803
So, what, I come back,
go to prom and leave again?

1195
01:17:20,875 --> 01:17:23,139
And then it`s graduation,
and leave again?

1196
01:17:23,211 --> 01:17:27,045
- That was our plan.
- i don`t think i can do it, Troy.

1197
01:17:27,115 --> 01:17:29,481
I think l`ve run out of goodbyes.

1198
01:17:29,551 --> 01:17:31,519
Why do you keep saying goodbye?

1199
01:17:34,389 --> 01:17:36,448
I love you, Wildcat.

1200
01:17:36,524 --> 01:17:39,721
But I need to stay
right where I am. I`m sorry.

1201
01:17:41,896 --> 01:17:43,227
Gabriella.

1202
01:17:49,571 --> 01:17:52,039
She`s not coming back, man.

1203
01:17:52,107 --> 01:17:55,565
- Is she going to miss prom?
- No, she`s not coming back at all.

1204
01:17:57,645 --> 01:18:00,944
Wow. That`s lousy, man.

1205
01:18:02,851 --> 01:18:03,943
It really is.

1206
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:06,312
But, hey, man.

1207
01:18:08,123 --> 01:18:11,422
Everybody knows you don`t bring
the girl with you after high school.

1208
01:18:12,827 --> 01:18:17,423
Look, Gabriella is already
one step ahead. As usual.

1209
01:18:19,033 --> 01:18:22,332
Right now you got
to snap out of it, dude.

1210
01:18:22,404 --> 01:18:26,773
She`s off to Stanford.
And, look, I am right there with you.

1211
01:18:26,841 --> 01:18:31,540
Taylor`s heading to Yale.
And you and me are going to U of A.

1212
01:18:33,748 --> 01:18:35,045
It`s a new ball game.

1213
01:18:40,054 --> 01:18:42,852
Maybe I don`t see my life
as a ball game anymore, man.

1214
01:18:45,059 --> 01:18:46,083
Look.

1215
01:18:47,929 --> 01:18:50,921
You`re gonna go to the prom with us,
be with your friends.

1216
01:18:50,999 --> 01:18:54,400
You`re gonna have
a good time. All right?

1217
01:18:54,469 --> 01:18:57,927
I don`t plan on missing my prom.

1218
01:18:58,006 --> 01:18:59,337
There we go.

1219
01:19:29,671 --> 01:19:32,504
I figured you`d be the last one
out of the building.

1220
01:19:35,376 --> 01:19:37,344
I don`t believe this.

1221
01:19:37,412 --> 01:19:39,380
I took a wrong turn on the way to prom.

1222
01:19:40,815 --> 01:19:43,010
So did you.

1223
01:19:43,084 --> 01:19:48,522
You are so crazy, Wildcat.
And what is it with you and trees?

1224
01:19:48,590 --> 01:19:51,081
I guess I see things
more clearly from up here.

1225
01:19:52,093 --> 01:19:54,493
You look handsome.

1226
01:19:54,562 --> 01:19:58,623
Prom is tonight in Albuquerque.
It`s a thousand miles away.

1227
01:20:03,271 --> 01:20:05,364
My prom is wherever you are.

1228
01:20:07,475 --> 01:20:11,571
If l`m going to have a last dance
at East High, it`s going to be with you.

1229
01:20:16,985 --> 01:20:22,013
! Take my hand
i`ll take the lead

1230
01:20:22,090 --> 01:20:27,357
! And every turn will be safe with me

1231
01:20:27,428 --> 01:20:32,695
! Don`t be afraid
Afraid to fall

1232
01:20:32,767 --> 01:20:38,330
! You know i`ll catch you through it all

1233
01:20:38,406 --> 01:20:42,206
-! And you can`t keep us apart
-! Even a thousand miles

1234
01:20:42,277 --> 01:20:44,142
! Can`t keep us apart

1235
01:20:44,212 --> 01:20:49,707
! `Cause my heart is wherever you are

1236
01:20:49,784 --> 01:20:52,082
! it`s like catching lightning

1237
01:20:52,153 --> 01:20:56,283
! The chances of finding someone

1238
01:20:56,357 --> 01:20:59,087
! Like you

1239
01:21:00,361 --> 01:21:02,522
! it`s one in a million

1240
01:21:02,597 --> 01:21:05,361
! The chances of feeling

1241
01:21:05,433 --> 01:21:09,927
! The way we do

1242
01:21:10,004 --> 01:21:15,408

You know... I`m not the only one
that changed when you came to East High.

1249
01:22:16,204 --> 01:22:21,005
Kids that I used to just pass
in the hallway... we`re friends now.

1250
01:22:21,075 --> 01:22:23,475
And we`re supposed to
be doing a show together.

1251
01:22:25,813 --> 01:22:29,044
The problem is, East High
changed when you got there.

1252
01:22:29,117 --> 01:22:31,608
And now it`s changed again
because you left.

1253
01:22:35,890 --> 01:22:39,417
You might be ready
to say goodbye to East High,

1254
01:22:39,494 --> 01:22:42,486
but East High`s not ready
to say goodbye to you.

1255

OK. Toodles. And I love the roses!

in sort of a vibe-y level.

I`m Jimmy ``The Rocket`` Zara.

1264

What are you? A Muppet gangster?

1265
01:23:27,341 --> 01:23:31,903
Oh. What is that? Is that
your cologne or a toxic spill?

1266
01:23:31,979 --> 01:23:36,075
Oh, yeah. It`s called ``Babe Magnet."`
Bought it just for the show.

- ``Break a leg``? What does that mean?

1275
01:24:00,241 --> 01:24:03,108

- As Troy?

You did it. You graduated.

Whoo hoo hoo!

Taylor McKessie, Yale University,
with honors, Political Science.

1455
01:36:14,575 --> 01:36:16,634
And I am pleased to announce that due

1456
01:36:16,710 --> 01:36:19,611
to the excellence
displayed here this evening,

1457
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:23,343
the Juilliard School has made
an extraordinary decision.

1458
01:36:23,417 --> 01:36:28,286
Another senior is being offered
a Juilliard scholarship.

1459
01:36:28,355 --> 01:36:32,985
Congratulations,
Mr. Ryan Evans, Choreography.

1460
01:36:37,030 --> 01:36:39,965
And congratulations, Miss Sharpay Evans.

1461
01:36:40,033 --> 01:36:43,264
University of Albuquerque,
Performing Arts.

1462
01:36:43,337 --> 01:36:47,103
Miss Evans has agreed
to return to East High next fall

1463
01:36:47,174 --> 01:36:50,507
to assist me in running
the Drama Department.

1464
01:36:52,513 --> 01:36:57,815
And now a senior who I believe
has a decision to make.

1465
01:36:57,885 --> 01:37:00,786
Mr. Troy Bolton. Troy.

1466
01:37:08,262 --> 01:37:09,923
I`ve chosen basketball.

1467
01:37:11,732 --> 01:37:13,791
But l`ve also chosen theater.

1468
01:37:21,808 --> 01:37:25,835
The University of California,
Berkeley, offers me both.

1469
01:37:25,913 --> 01:37:28,507
That`s where l`m going
to be attending next fall.

1470
01:37:31,218 --> 01:37:35,882
But most of all, I choose the
person who inspires my heart.

1471
01:37:37,324 --> 01:37:43,229
Which is why I picked
a school that`s exactly 32.7...

1472
01:37:43,297 --> 01:37:44,457
...miles from you.

1473

Miss Gabriella Montez,
Stanford University, Pre-Law.

1474
01:38:00,147 --> 01:38:03,048
Next, Mr. Chad Danforth.

1475
01:38:03,116 --> 01:38:07,052
University of Albuquerque,
Basketball Scholarship!

1476
01:38:07,688 --> 01:38:08,848
He`s gone.

1477
01:38:11,158 --> 01:38:13,149
Mr. Danforth.

1478
01:38:29,943 --> 01:38:32,104
He goes up for the shot and it`s good!

for the record books!

[mimics crowd cheering]

1481
01:38:43,890 --> 01:38:46,586
Once they hand us that diploma,
we`re done here?

1482
01:38:46,660 --> 01:38:49,026
What makes you think
we`re getting diplomas?

1483
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:57,837
One question: does Berkeley play?

1484
01:38:57,904 --> 01:39:01,806
Oh, yeah. We`re scheduled to kick
some Redhawk butt next November.

1485
01:39:04,144 --> 01:39:05,771
Game on, Hoops.

1486
01:39:05,846 --> 01:39:07,245
Yeah.

1487
01:39:10,317 --> 01:39:13,684
Oh! One more steal. The final point.

1488
01:39:15,856 --> 01:39:19,690
Danforth! Bolton!
You get out there and you get onstage!

1489
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:21,853
I never thought l`d hear
my dad say that.

1490
01:39:36,410 --> 01:39:40,278
! We`re all in this together

1491
01:39:40,347 --> 01:39:42,338
! Once we know

1492
01:39:42,416 --> 01:39:44,884
! That we are
We`re all stars

1493
01:39:44,951 --> 01:39:46,578
! And we see that

1494
01:39:46,653 --> 01:39:50,384
East High is a place where teachers
encouraged us to break the status quo.

1495
01:39:51,458 --> 01:39:54,188
And define ourselves as we choose.

1496
01:39:54,261 --> 01:39:58,197
Where a jock can cook up
a mean crme brle.

1497
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:03,395
And the brainiac can break down
on the dance floor.

1498
01:40:08,341 --> 01:40:12,835
It`s a place where one person...
if it`s the right person...

1499
01:40:17,651 --> 01:40:19,084
...changes us all.

1500
01:40:21,221 --> 01:40:24,554
East High is having friends that
we`ll keep for the rest of our lives.

1501
01:40:26,193 --> 01:40:29,754
And I guess that means
we really are all in this together.

1502
01:40:32,165 --> 01:40:33,826
Because once a Wildcat...

1503
01:40:35,202 --> 01:40:37,136
...always a Wildcat.

1504
01:40:38,205 --> 01:40:40,639
- Yeah, man.
- Thank you!

1505
01:40:48,348 --> 01:40:50,976
