1
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,380
Is anybody there?

2
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,260
Jeanne.

3
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,980
I'm always happy to see you, but to
keep coming twice, three times a day--

4
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,860
- I need to confess.
- You already confessed this morning.

5
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,780
I need to confess again.

6
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,620
What terrible sin
have you committed since then...

7
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,540
that can't wait till tomorrow
to be forgiven?

8
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,380
I saw a poor monk without shoes,
so I gave him some.

9
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,180
There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.

10
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,100
- They weren't my shoes.
- Whose were they?

11
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,980
- My father's.
- I'm sure he'll forgive you.

12
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,860
He already did.

13
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,780
But I want Jesus
to forgive me too.

14
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,660
If we were to ask forgiveness
all the time...

15
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,580
we'd spend our whole life
in church.

16
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,420
- Is that bad?
- Well, no, but--

17
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,220
- Are you happy at home?
- Oh, yes, very.

18
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,100
And your mother?
Everything's fine with her?

19
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,020
Yes, she's wonderful.

20
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,900
And your sister, Catherine,
she's still your best friend?

21
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,740
My sister's just--
She's wonderful.

22
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,540
And what about your other friends?
You don't like playing with them?

23
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,420
Oh, yes.
I play with them, lots.

24
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,260
Everything sounds wonderful.

25
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,140
Yes, it is.

26
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,060
Then why are you here so often?

27
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,860
I feel safe here.
It's where I can talk to him.

28
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,700
Him?

29
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,580
Well, I try to talk to him...

30
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,420
but mostly he's the one
who does the talking.

31
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,260
Who is this ''he''?

32
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,060
He never says his name.

33
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,860
What does he...

34
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,780
look like?

35
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,460
Beautiful.

36
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,260
And what does he say to you?

37
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,140
He says--

38
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,820
He says--
He says I must be good...

39
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,620
and help everyone
and take care of myself.

40
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,500
Do you think he's coming
from the sky?

41
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,340
Perhaps.

42
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,100
But wherever he's coming from,
I think you should listen to him...

43
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,940
'cause it sounds like
he's giving you very good advice.

44
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,820
It's--
It's wonderful!

45
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:40,700
It's wonderful.

46
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,460
Jeanne.

47
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,340
Mother!

48
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,060
Catherine!

49
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,420
Jeanne, are you all right?
Did they hurt you?

50
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,340
I'm fine, really.

51
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,220
We've all been looking for you.
The English are everywhere.

52
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,140
- I was in the church.
- Really?

53
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,020
I was talking to the priest.
Do you know what he said to me?

54
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,940
Burn over there!

55
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,860
Tell me later.
Quick, hide in here.

56
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,660
- Where are you gonna be?
- I'll be right here.

57
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:33,620
I promise.

58
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:43,220
Well, that's what I call booty.

59
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,620
Comrade.

60
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,900
A woman with a sword.

61
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,700
Look at this.

62
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,580
Frenchmen are such cowards,
they've left all the fighting to women.

63
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:48,420
If that's God's will,
then so be it.

64
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,260
Fine with me.
I love women.

65
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,220
Hold still, bitch.

66
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,140
How can I do it
if you keep wriggling about?

67
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:08,980
Your turn now.

68
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,500
God, preserve and bless the soul
of this, our dearly departed.

69
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,380
Keep us safe from fear and sin.
Amen.

70
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,060
Come on.

71
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,340
Listen, Jeanne.

72
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:38,180
Your aunt and uncle are gonna take you
to their house for a couple of weeks...

73
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,060
just to give us time
to rebuild things here.

74
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,620
You understand?

75
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,700
Lord, we give thanks
for the food you've given us.

76
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,620
Teach us always
to love this land...

77
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,460
and to save it from those
who seek to destroy it.

78
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,380
- Amen.
- Amen.

79
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,380
So, good night, then.

80
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,900
- What's going to happen to her?
- She'll be fine.

81
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:45,700
She'll grow up, find a good man,
make him some children. Don't worry.

82
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,620
She's been hurt, but she'll survive.

83
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,500
Tomorrow she'll be
as right as rain.

84
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,420
You'll see.

85
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,180
I want to see a priest.

86
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,060
- Why did she have to die?
- Only God can answer that.

87
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:27,900
I know Jesus says
to love your enemies, but I can't.

88
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,740
I just want the English
to burn in hell forever and ever!

89
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,580
I realize your anger, Jeanne.

90
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,500
But we must learn to forgive.
It's hard...

91
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:41,340
but revenge will never
bring about peace.

92
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,220
What will?
And what will bring her back?

93
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,060
And why did she have to die
in the first place instead of me?

94
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,980
Why didn't He take my life
instead of hers?

95
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,860
It was my fault!
I was late!

96
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:57,660
She gave me her hiding place!
Why did He save me?

97
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,540
Calm down, Jeanne.
Calm down.

98
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,260
I don't pretend
to know God's will...

99
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,140
but one thing I am sure:

100
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,980
The Lord always has a good reason.

101
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,820
Perhaps He chose you because
He needs you...

102
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,740
for some higher calling.

103
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,620
As long as you answer that call...

104
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,460
your sister will not
have died in vain.

105
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,340
I don't want to wait
for His call.

106
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,260
Be patient.

107
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,180
I want to be with Him always.

108
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:36,020
Soon you will be able to take part
in your Holy Mass.

109
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,900
When you eat of His flesh
and drink of His blood...

110
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,820
you will be at one with Him.

111
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,620
I want to be at one with Him now.

112
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,300
So, what did he say?

113
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,180
He says we must bring her to church
whenever she wants.

114
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:59,020
Easy for him. He's not the one
who has to do the bringing.

115
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,940
Come on.
This is important.

116
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,820
We mustn't let her out of our sight.

117
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,660
Don't worry. I will watch her
like my own shadow.

118
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,540
I want to be at one with You now.

119
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,140
A message for the dauphin of France.

120
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:40,700
A message.

121
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:53,140
Captain, a message for the dauphin.

122
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,060
I'll take it.

123
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,700
The dauphin!
The dauphin!

124
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,980
Louis. Louis. Hey.
Shouldn't you be learning your lessons?

125
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,900
I don't want to learn.
I want to fight.

126
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,700
You will. But for now, you must
at least learn to wipe your nose.

127
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,460
A letter for His Majesty.

128
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:41,100
Another one from this girl
calling herself the Maiden of Lorraine.

129
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,980
I can read for myself,
you know?

130
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,860
She pretends she's been sent by God.
Charlatans.

131
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,780
It's a pity there isn't enough wood
to burn them all.

132
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,660
- She says she'll be here tomorrow.
- You mustn't see her, My Lord.

133
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,500
We know nothing about her. We don't
even know if she's from Lorraine.

134
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,420
What difference does it make
where she comes from?

135
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,300
If she comes from Burgundy,
it makes a difference.

136
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,220
It might be a trap.
Look, signed ''X.''

137
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,100
What sort of a name is ''X''?

138
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,980
Or must we assume that a messenger
of God can't even write her own name?

139
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,860
My Lord, Trémoille is correct.
She says she hears voices.

140
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,740
She may be a sorceress,
a witch.

141
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,620
Regnault, you see witches everywhere.

142
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,540
She's just a peasant.

143
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,380
A peasant who cares about her king.

144
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:25,220
All she wants is to see me crowned
and permission to fight for me.

145
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:29,060
Not exactly. She wants you
to give her an army at your expense.

146
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,940
Bearing in mind your mother stole every
last piece of gold in the treasury...

147
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,820
I fail to see how you can afford
such an adventure.

148
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,740
I can see her if I want to.

149
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,500
After all, with half of France
in the hands of the English...

150
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,380
what have I got to lose?

151
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,340
The other half.

152
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,220
You mustn't see her,
Your Majesty.

153
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,140
She may be an instrument
of the devil.

154
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,060
Well, I think you should.

155
00:22:59,260 --> 00:22:59,740
Well, here's an amusing situation.

156
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,580
I would love to know why my devoted
mother-in-law thinks one thing...

157
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:07,420
and my two most loyal
and trusted advisors...

158
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,340
think precisely the opposite.

159
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:13,180
Because I care about you.
Come here.

160
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,580
Your health and happiness has always
been my first concern, Charles...

161
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,500
ever since you were a little boy.

162
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,420
And I think I know you
better than your own mother.

163
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,340
You think so, eh?

164
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,220
Yes.

165
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,100
I know, for example,
the sickness that plagues your heart.

166
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,980
I know how painful it is
for you to have loved a father...

167
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,820
without ever knowing
if he was really yours.

168
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,660
Do I know you enough? Hmm?

169
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,460
What has that got to do
with this maiden?

170
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:57,300
Who better than a messenger from God
to give answers to your questions?

171
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:01,140
You think she was sent from God?

172
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,060
You're a fine judge
of character, Charles.

173
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,900
It'll take you less than five minutes
to expose her if she's a fake.

174
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,740
But if she's not...

175
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,580
then she will give you
your answers...

176
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,380
and place the crown on your head.

177
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,140
With respect to my lady, I think it's
going to take more than a peasant girl--

178
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:27,020
I'm not interested
in what you think, Trémoille...

179
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:27,980
or even what I think.

180
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,860
It's what simple people think
that matters, and the fact is that...

181
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:36,620
simple people up and down this country
are already talking about her.

182
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,540
Now, you know
what simple people are like--

183
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,420
always ready to believe
any old prophecy.

184
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,140
Like this one...

185
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:50,020
about a virgin from Lorraine...

186
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,900
saving France.

187
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,660
And now...

188
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,500
this girl comes along...

189
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,420
from Lorraine.

190
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:09,220
And suddenly, there's a spark
of hope in their simple minds.

191
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,820
You shouldn't disappoint them.

192
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,660
If they believe in her--

193
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,500
if she can put back
the fire in our army--

194
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,380
then I believe in her too.

195
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:44,700
Stop it!

196
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,500
Louis, be quiet for once.

197
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,620
- She's coming, Your Majesty.
- All right.

198
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:10,580
Calm yourself.

199
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,420
Your Majesty, I urge you
not to see this woman.

200
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,340
It all reeks of a Burgundian trap.

201
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:20,180
My astrologers assure me the timing
is propitious: Leo with Virgo rising.

202
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:24,020
Have you never noticed
on the astrological chart...

203
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,940
that the virgin
is next to the lion?

204
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,860
Supposing she's an assassin?

205
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,700
My-My-My dear Trémoille...

206
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,620
I'm not even king yet.

207
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,540
Who would want to assassinate me?

208
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,260
She's arrived, My Lord.
She's in the guards' room.

209
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,220
Fine, fine.

210
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,940
I suppose I shall have
to make a decision.

211
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,460
Why is life so complicated?

212
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,300
Sometimes I really wish
I could be someone else.

213
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,100
That's a good idea, sire.

214
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,900
What do you mean?

215
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,740
Let someone else
pretend to be you.

216
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,620
And see if she can find me?
That's a brilliant idea.

217
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,500
If she's really been sent by God,
she'll discover the trap.

218
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,380
And if she's an assassin,
she'll kill the wrong man. Brilliant.

219
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,980
Please. Please!

220
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,860
We're - We're going to play
a little game.

221
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:30,620
Now, let us pretend
that my throne is empty.

222
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,500
Just pretend.

223
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,420
Who wants to be king?

224
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:42,140
Now, there's a heart warming sight.

225
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:48,820
Now, let us see which one of you
could possibly pass...

226
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,700
as the king of France.

227
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,540
Alençon, my noble duke.

228
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,420
My royal cousin.
So fine, so brave, so rich.

229
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:02,260
So very rich.
So far-too-rich to be king of France.

230
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,140
Everyone knows I'm the poorest man
in my kingdom.

231
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:12,820
Gilles de Rais.
Marshall of France.

232
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,700
Formidable to men,
fascinating to women.

233
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,620
Feared by all.

234
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,460
You would be perfect
to sit on my throne.

235
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:25,260
So perfect that you might
like it too much...

236
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:29,100
and therefore disturb
my - my fragile peace of mind.

237
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:34,860
La Hire.

238
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,700
My angry captain,
and bravest in France.

239
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:42,540
Scarred by a dozen wars, but with
a heart and a stomach for a dozen more.

240
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,420
- You could pass for the king.
- Damn bloody right I could.

241
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,340
Until you open your mouth,
because no one...

242
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,260
with a tongue like that
could possible pass as king of France.

243
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,700
It looks like it shall have
to be me after all.

244
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:08,420
Why not you, Jean d’Aulon?

245
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:12,260
The only man
who's poorer than I am...

246
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,180
therefore the only man
I can trust.

247
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,980
Dignified, honorable, wise.

248
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,900
What more can we ask of a king?

249
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,580
My lord, I'm not sure that--

250
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:29,540
Are you not prepared
to die for your king?

251
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,460
- Of course I am.
- Good.

252
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,340
Until then, feel free to live
like a king. Bring her up.

253
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,780
Sire, you know how bad I am
at this sort of game.

254
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,700
Pretend it's not a game.

255
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,540
Make way for the dauphin.

256
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,100
- Mother?
- Not now.

257
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,820
I have come to see the dauphin.

258
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:48,580
Who are you?

259
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:51,460
I'm - I'm --

260
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:56,260
His most gracious majesty,
Charles de Valois...

261
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,180
dauphin of France.

262
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:20,260
I can see you are a good man.

263
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,220
But you're not the dauphin.

264
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,860
I'm sorry to insist,
but I must see the dauphin.

265
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,740
We have no time to lose.
Where is he?

266
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:37,500
He's here.
Find him yourself.

267
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,260
Now you'll see
who'll pass for a king.

268
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:19,180
There's no need to be afraid, sire.

269
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,060
I'm not the king.

270
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:26,820
I know you're not yet,
but you will be soon.

271
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,220
Out. Out.

272
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,060
How did you know who I am?

273
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,980
- Her voices, of course.
- ''That's him,'' they said.

274
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,860
''The one in the corner
with the big nose.''

275
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:57,540
Back off!.

276
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,220
Oh, my gentle dauphin.

277
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,780
I have a message...

278
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,660
from the King of Heaven...

279
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,580
for you.

280
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,420
You only.

281
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,980
Follow me.

282
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:36,860
Your Majesty, I really think --

283
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:41,660
My dear loyal Trémoille,
I know I can count on you...

284
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,540
to - to ensure our privacy.

285
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,420
I need to talk to her alone.

286
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,100
He needs to talk to her alone.

287
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,020
Fine.

288
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,260
I was about ten years old.

289
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:17,140
It was a beautiful spring day.

290
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,060
I was taking a shortcut home
through the forest...

291
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:23,820
when a strange wind...

292
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,740
began to blow.

293
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:37,260
It was such a strange sound,
almost like words...

294
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,180
calling me.

295
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,300
The second time...

296
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,140
was many years later.

297
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:06,980
I was coming back from church,
when suddenly...

298
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,900
the same...

299
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:12,740
violent wind.

300
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,460
Then...

301
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:23,300
a shape...

302
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,220
appeared...

303
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,060
in the middle of the sky.

304
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,940
The shape...

305
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:32,900
of...

306
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:35,780
of a man.

307
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:53,020
Everything was moving so fast.
So fast.

308
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:56,860
The wind, the clouds.

309
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:01,660
I couldn't move.
I couldn't breathe.

310
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:06,460
I was so frightened.

311
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,340
He was...

312
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,260
so...

313
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:13,180
so...

314
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,060
here.

315
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,540
And then I knew
that God had chosen me.

316
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:31,380
But I did not understand
what it was He wanted me to do.

317
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:35,220
What was my mission?
What could I do to help my country?

318
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,100
But how? I was nothing.
I was just a poor girl.

319
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:42,900
I did not know anything about--
about making war or riding.

320
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:46,740
So I decided to wait...

321
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,620
and not to speak of it
to anybody.

322
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,540
You did well.
You did well.

323
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,420
I didn't wait long.

324
00:39:55,860 --> 00:40:00,180
I was going to Mass,
like I do every day...

325
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,020
and the same...

326
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,860
strange wind--

327
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:36,620
Everything was made clear.

328
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,460
God had given me a message.

329
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,260
A message to deliver.

330
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:50,020
What--

331
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,940
What was the message?

332
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,500
He said...

333
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:06,340
that I must save France
from her enemies...

334
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:09,220
and bring her back
into the hands of God.

335
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:12,100
And He told me that I...

336
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,020
Jeanne...

337
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,900
will lead you
to the altar at Reims...

338
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,700
where you will be crowned...

339
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:24,540
the king...

340
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,260
of France.

341
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,220
- Sire, are you --
- I'm fine.

342
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,980
This is, in fact, Jean d'Aulon,
my loyal friend and finest archer.

343
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,820
I put her in your care.

344
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,700
Find her suitable lodgings
here in the castle...

345
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:09,620
and guard her with your life.

346
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:13,460
Sire, I won't be needing any lodgings
if we're to be marching on Orléans.

347
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:15,380
Orléans has held out
for six months...

348
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:18,260
so I don't suppose a few days more
will make much difference.

349
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:19,220
Take some rest.

350
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,820
Put the bags here.

351
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,660
Please accept my apologies...

352
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:35,540
for me pretending
to be the -- you know.

353
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,460
Do you think
that I can have some water?

354
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:40,340
Water. Yes, of course.

355
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:42,220
Would you get some water?

356
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,140
- Anything else?
- I need to see a priest.

357
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:47,980
- Now?
- Yes. I didn't confess today.

358
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:53,740
All right.
Raymond, a priest.

359
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:54,700
Anything else?

360
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:56,620
I shall also be needing
a new war horse...

361
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:59,500
a sword, armor...

362
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:02,380
and an artist
to make a banner for me.

363
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:05,260
- Now?
- Better today than tomorrow.

364
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:07,180
This might take a little time...

365
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:11,020
but let me see what I can do.

366
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,860
Oh! I shall also be needing someone
who can read and write.

367
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:16,780
This I can do.

368
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:19,660
I was studying at the University
of Paris until the English invaded it.

369
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:22,500
- I thought you were an archer.
- Yes, I am.

370
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:27,300
I'm an archer who can read and write.
Who do you want to write to?

371
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,220
The king of England.

372
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:34,020
I want to give him the chance
to leave in peace...

373
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:38,820
before I get to Orléans.

374
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,300
The archbishop and I have just begun
negotiations with the Burgundians.

375
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:53,220
If we can bring them over
to our side--

376
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:57,060
Negotiate, by all means,
but from a position of strength.

377
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:59,940
If the English take Orléans,
there'll be nothing left to negotiate.

378
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:01,860
The rest of the country
will be theirs.

379
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,700
My lady, it will be
the height of folly...

380
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:07,580
to let this child
lead our army...

381
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:11,420
in the king's name
without verifying her true motives.

382
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,340
My Lord, Trémoille is right.

383
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:17,180
We must be absolutely certain that
she is not an instrument of the devil.

384
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:21,020
How can anyone be
absolutely certain about anything?

385
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:26,780
Sometimes, our intuitions
are our best counselors.

386
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:30,620
We must listen to Mother Holy Church
before we listen to our intuitions.

387
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:37,340
Wait.

388
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:42,100
She claims to be a virgin.

389
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:44,980
Well, that's something
we can examine...

390
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:47,860
and be absolutely certain about.

391
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:07,060
Let's find out.

392
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:34,740
What if she's not?

393
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:38,580
If she's not,
I'll kill her myself.

394
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:52,020
There is no sign
of corruption or violation.

395
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:53,940
She is intact.

396
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:02,540
And what, exactly,
was this vision wearing?

397
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:03,500
I don't remember.

398
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:06,380
This vision,
did it give you anything?

399
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:09,260
An object?
A ring or a rosary...

400
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:13,100
or anything by which
we can verify your claim?

401
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:15,020
He gave me good advice.

402
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,900
During your child hood, did you have
any sort of military experience?

403
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:21,740
Are you practiced in the skills
of swords man ship?

404
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:24,620
No, but I'm good with a stick.

405
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,340
Do you know what
a Dijon Culverin is?

406
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:35,180
It's an item of artillery.

407
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:37,100
How can you expect
to raise the siege of Orléans...

408
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:39,020
if you're ignorant
about modern artillery?

409
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:43,780
The road to Orléans is long,
and I have good captains with me.

410
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:45,700
I will learn fast, believe me.

411
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:48,580
We would like to believe you, Jeanne,
but we feel...

412
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:51,460
that if God wanted us
to believe you...

413
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:54,340
he would've sent a sign with you.

414
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:58,180
So, can you do something?

415
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:02,020
Show us something?

416
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:06,820
A sign to prove...

417
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:08,740
that you are sent by God.

418
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:14,500
I did not come here
to perform tricks.

419
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:19,300
You are all much cleverer
than I am.

420
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:23,100
I mean, me,
I don't know ''A'' from '' B.''

421
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:25,020
But this much I do know.

422
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:29,820
While the people of France
lie bleeding...

423
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,740
you sit around
in your fine clothes...

424
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:33,660
trying to deceive me...

425
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:37,500
when you're only
deceiving yourselves.

426
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:39,420
You say you are men of God...

427
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:44,220
yet you do not see His hand
in having guided me...

428
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:49,980
through 500 leagues of enemy country
to bring you His help.

429
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:51,900
Is that not proof enough?

430
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:59,580
Or do you still need more signs?

431
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:07,220
Give me an army.

432
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:12,020
Take me to Orléans.

433
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:18,740
And there you will see the sign
that I was sent to make.

434
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:47,500
Dunois.

435
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:51,340
- What?
- A big one, straight at us.

436
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:55,180
What side?

437
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:57,100
Window side.

438
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:13,420
What?

439
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:17,260
I have wonderful news, finally.

440
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:20,140
He is sending her to us.
Thanks be to God. We're saved.

441
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:21,100
It's--
It's wonderful.

442
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:23,940
Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.
Who has finally done what?

443
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:27,780
The dauphin. He's sending us
food and supplies and an army...

444
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:30,660
led by Jeanne,
the maiden from Lorraine.

445
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:32,580
Isn't it wonderful?

446
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:34,500
Yes, it's a miracle.

447
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:41,220
I can't believe
they are sending a woman.

448
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:45,060
I wonder what color dress
she'll be wearing.

449
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:46,980
Blue.

450
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:50,820
With a blue ribbon in her hair
to tie up Talbot.

451
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:57,540
Does anyone know if
she even knows how to ride a horse?

452
00:51:58,020 --> 00:51:58,500
She knows.

453
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:12,860
Were you sent by Lord Dunois?

454
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:15,740
Yes, we were.

455
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:18,620
- Where are the English?
- Everywhere. Where's the food?

456
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:20,540
It's coming.
I rode on ahead.

457
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:24,380
I have a message
for the captain of the English army.

458
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:25,340
- His name is Talbot.
- I know.

459
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:29,180
- Can you take me to him?
- He's on the other side of the river.

460
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:32,060
So, who gave the order for me
to be brought to this side of the river?

461
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:37,820
Hey, my friend. It's good
to see your ugly damn face again.

462
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:40,700
- La Hire, I'm warning you. Don't swear.
- Sorry, Jeanne.

463
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:45,460
Let me introduce the king's
half-brother, the dogged Lord Dunois.

464
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:49,300
Lord Dunois, will you show me
to the other side of the river?

465
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:52,180
Wait. Wait!

466
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:57,940
Fine! Go now, if you want!
But not with me!

467
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:01,780
You may have a duty to God,
but I have a duty to my people.

468
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:04,660
And my people are starving.

469
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,540
Right now, I'm going to take
the food back to the city.

470
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:10,420
And if you can please calm down
and let me accompany you to Orléans...

471
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:12,340
it will be my honor
to welcome you.

472
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:11,780
Jesus Christ.

473
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:13,700
The goddamn English
will pay for this.

474
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:17,540
Yes, they will, and so will you
if you don't stop swearing.

475
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:37,700
Come on. I'm happy
to welcome you in my tavern.

476
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:39,620
Come on in.

477
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:44,380
La Hire, Gilles,
let me show you something.

478
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,900
Tourelles are around here.
The river crosses there.

479
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:03,580
Calm down.
You can't blame those people.

480
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:05,500
They've been hearing
about you for weeks.

481
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:08,380
There's nothing to hear!
And why is there nothing to hear?

482
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:10,300
Because I haven't done anything!
And why haven't I?

483
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:13,180
'Cause none of you
will listen to me!

484
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:19,900
Why don't you join us?

485
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:22,740
We're about to discuss
the campaign.

486
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:26,580
I'm sorry.

487
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:28,500
So from here,
Talbot has spread his forces...

488
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:30,420
between these forts up here.

489
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:33,300
But in the last few days it seems,
according to our scouts...

490
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:36,180
that some troops have been
deployed to this fort here.

491
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:37,140
What about this huge pile down here?

492
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:40,020
That's the Tourelles.
The English were planning...

493
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,900
to launch an attack from it,
but then we broke down the bridge--

494
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:45,780
- I did.
- Yeah.

495
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:47,700
Which should keep them quiet
for a while.

496
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:50,580
Now, my hunch is...

497
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:52,500
the attack will come
from St. Loup, here.

498
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:55,380
And what does Jeanne think?

499
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:59,220
I don't think.
I leave that to God.

500
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:02,060
I am nothing in all of this.
I'm just the messenger.

501
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:03,980
So...

502
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:05,900
what is the message?

503
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:09,740
We give the English...

504
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:11,660
a last chance
to go home in peace.

505
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:13,580
And if they refuse?

506
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:14,540
If they refuse...

507
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:19,340
we recross the river...

508
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:23,180
and attack here...

509
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:24,140
at the Tourelles.

510
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:28,940
That makes no sense at all.
The Tourelles is virtually impregnable.

511
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:32,780
If we are on the other side of the river
attacking the Tourelles...

512
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:35,660
what's to stop Talbot
attacking the city from the north?

513
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:39,500
- God.
- God. Why, of course.

514
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:43,300
We'd forgotten about Him.

515
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:50,020
I feel a great sorrow for you
because you are laughing now...

516
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,900
but by tomorrow night,
some of you will be dead.

517
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:55,780
With respect, we can't just
attack the Tourelles like that.

518
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:58,660
- It's a very complicated matter.
- What's so complicated about it?

519
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:03,460
All you have to do is what you're told.
What could be simpler than that?

520
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:05,380
I am the drum...

521
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:07,300
on which God is beating out
His message.

522
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:10,180
He's beating it so hard,
it's bursting my ears!

523
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:13,060
You have to understand,
it's not easy for us.

524
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:15,940
I mean, for our pride
to suddenly be usurped by--

525
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:24,540
Well, with all due respect,
by a--

526
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:26,460
by a girl.

527
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:33,180
So that's it.

528
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:37,980
To you, I'm just a girl.

529
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:43,740
Put yourself in my shoes for a moment.
How would you feel if you were me?

530
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:46,620
Knowing what I know...

531
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:49,500
enormous gratitude.

532
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:55,260
One hell of a girl, huh?

533
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:02,900
I warned you.

534
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:10,580
I do love her when her fire
gets well and truly stoked.

535
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:12,500
Me too.

536
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:16,340
Hello, my friends!

537
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:19,220
What a journey.

538
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:21,140
But we made it.

539
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:24,020
Back together again.
Let's have some fun.

540
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:30,740
Fine.
I shall look like a man.

541
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:38,420
Stop it!

542
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:41,260
How dare you stop me
from doing God's will!

543
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:43,180
He didn't tell you
to cut all your hair off!.

544
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:45,100
How dare you tell me
what God tells me to do!

545
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:47,980
Whatever! But since He's not going
to come down and cut it Himself--

546
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:49,900
At least let someone
cut it properly!

547
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:54,700
Raymond, bring the scissors.

548
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:57,580
Louis, fetch the mirror.

549
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:03,340
Stop getting so angry about everything.
Calm down.

550
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:07,180
I am calm!
It's God that's angry.

551
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:10,060
I need to send a letter, now.

552
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:11,020
Fine.

553
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:13,900
''To you, Henry, king of England...

554
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:17,740
and to you, Duke of Bedford,
who call yourself regent of France...

555
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:21,540
obey the King of Heaven
and abandon your siege.

556
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:24,420
Give back the keys
to the other towns you've taken...

557
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:26,340
and go back home
to your island.

558
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:30,180
To you, Lord Talbot, I beg you
as humbly as I can beg you...

559
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:33,060
for the sake of the lives
of your soldiers...

560
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:34,980
do not bring about
your own destruction.

561
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:38,820
Surrender to me, Jeanne the maiden,
who wassen there by God. ''

562
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:43,620
Message!

563
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:46,500
''But if you do not
heed my warning...

564
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:48,420
then we shall raise
such a battle cry...

565
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:50,340
as there has not been heard in France
for a thousand years. ''

566
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:01,820
Sire, message.

567
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:04,700
''This is the third and last time
I will write to you.

568
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:06,620
If you are still here at noon,
I warn you...

569
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:09,500
you will hear from me
to your very great destruction.

570
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:12,380
Please give me your answer
speedily. ''

571
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:14,300
Go fuck yourself!

572
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:19,100
What did they say?

573
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:22,940
They said
they'll think about it.

574
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:25,820
Good.

575
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:28,700
To be honest,
I don't think they'll leave tomorrow.

576
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:34,460
I can't wait for tomorrow.

577
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:03,220
French blood is spilling.

578
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:09,940
Wake up! Hurry!

579
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:14,740
They've started the battle
without me.

580
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:23,340
There's a battle to fight
and a war to be won.

581
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:28,140
Damn.

582
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:33,900
Sound the retreat!

583
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:37,740
My banner.
My banner!

584
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:45,420
Open the gate!

585
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:00,780
What happened?
Who gave the order to attack?

586
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:03,620
God knows.
It was a bad idea.

587
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:05,540
Were the men confessed?
Where are the priests?

588
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:08,420
We didn't take them.
We wanted to make a surprise attack.

589
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:10,340
Dunois, was it you
who gave the order to attack?

590
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:14,180
- Answer me!
- Can we discuss this later?

591
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:17,060
Sooner is better than later.

592
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:18,020
Wait!

593
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:22,820
You'll be killed!

594
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:35,300
Follow me!

595
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:37,220
Follow me
and I will give you victory!

596
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:45,820
Close it!

597
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:47,740
Close the drawbridge!

598
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:11,740
To the drawbridge!

599
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:17,500
- What is she doing?
- To the drawbridge!

600
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:19,420
- The drawbridge is closed.
- Not for long.

601
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:28,980
Let's go!

602
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:57,220
That's mine.

603
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:10,660
It's a great victory--
your victory--

604
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:12,580
but we must follow it through
and pursue the English...

605
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:15,460
back to Talbot's camp unless,
of course, you have another good idea.

606
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:19,300
First, we find
the biggest army we can.

607
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:21,180
- Then we return to Orléans.
- The bridge has been pulled down.

608
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:25,020
- The English are rebuilding it.
- And how do you know?

609
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:28,860
You have been with your counsel,
and I have been with mine.

610
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:41,340
Come on!
Hurry up!

611
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:05,300
Be careful with my baby.

612
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:37,940
- That's the Tourelles.
- Wonderful.

613
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:38,900
Captain!

614
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:47,500
Looks like the froggy whore's
coming to pay us a visit.

615
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:49,420
I'd better tell Glasdale.

616
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:56,140
Let's put the horses over there.

617
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:04,780
Fathers, please, bless them.

618
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:06,700
- Please, bless them all.
- We will.

619
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:23,940
Let's plan this attack a little more
carefully than this morning.

620
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:25,860
Good idea.

621
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:31,620
Sire.

622
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:36,420
We've got, uh, visitors.

623
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:56,580
Glasdale!

624
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:01,340
Do you hear me?

625
01:08:01,820 --> 01:08:03,260
You, who call me a whore...

626
01:08:03,740 --> 01:08:07,100
I feel pity for you,
for your soul...

627
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:09,020
and for the souls of your men!

628
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:12,860
Yield! Yield now
to the King of Heaven!

629
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:15,740
Or go back to your island!

630
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:19,580
And you, go back to your pigsty!

631
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:28,220
Man the walls.

632
01:08:48,820 --> 01:08:50,260
This morning...

633
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:53,140
God gave us a great victory.

634
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:59,860
But it is nothing compared
to what He is ready to give us now.

635
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:03,700
I know you are all
tired and hungry...

636
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:06,580
but I swear to you...

637
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:11,380
that even if these English were hanging
from the clouds by their fingertips...

638
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:13,300
we would pull them down
before nightfall.

639
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:17,140
Now...

640
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:19,060
let all those who love me...

641
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:22,860
follow me!

642
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:31,500
Follow me!

643
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:43,020
You were saying?

644
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:50,700
Come on!

645
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:56,460
- I go right.
- I go left!

646
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:03,140
Come on!

647
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:10,820
Get that fucking pot of oil
up here now!

648
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:22,340
Get that fucking thing moving!

649
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:34,820
Come on!
Move that fucker faster!

650
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:38,660
You're beautiful.

651
01:10:39,140 --> 01:10:40,540
Let's see if you're powerful.

652
01:10:56,380 --> 01:10:57,820
- Do something!
- Like what?

653
01:10:58,300 --> 01:10:59,740
I don't care!
Do something!

654
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:02,620
And fire!

655
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:12,220
Fire!

656
01:11:16,540 --> 01:11:17,020
What the fuck?

657
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:19,900
Too high.
Reload!

658
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:37,140
- Get out of here!
- Where are the men?

659
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:40,020
You're gonna get killed!
Get out of here!

660
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:50,580
Come on, fight!

661
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:54,420
Go!
Come on, fight!

662
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:03,020
Bring the culverin!

663
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:09,740
Get out!

664
01:12:14,060 --> 01:12:16,460
I'm going up the side!

665
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:27,980
- Jeanne!
- Leave me alone!

666
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:31,820
Hurry!
Come on! Come on!

667
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:22,620
Yes!

668
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:26,460
Hey, you just killed my woman!
Captain!

669
01:13:28,860 --> 01:13:30,300
Go to hell.

670
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:36,060
Call the physician!
The physician!

671
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:37,980
Damn it!

672
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:40,860
Louis, find the physician.

673
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:43,740
We have to take out the arrow.

674
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:45,660
She'll bleed to death.

675
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:48,540
There must be something we can do
for her, for Christ's sakes.

676
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:52,380
- Yes. You can pray.
- Good idea.

677
01:13:54,780 --> 01:13:58,140
I swear that I will
never swear again in my life...

678
01:13:58,620 --> 01:14:00,060
if You save her life.

679
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:02,900
But I'm warning You,
if You let her die...

680
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:03,860
then You're the biggest--

681
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:11,540
- Don't swear.
- He heard me.

682
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:16,340
Why--

683
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:18,260
Why aren't you fighting?

684
01:14:18,740 --> 01:14:19,220
You've been badly wounded.

685
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:23,060
- It's nothing. It's --
- It's an arrow.

686
01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:24,980
And it's in deep.

687
01:14:31,220 --> 01:14:32,660
You must stay still
till the physician arrives.

688
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:36,500
Physicians are a waste of time.
We'll have more luck with this charm.

689
01:14:36,980 --> 01:14:39,380
It saved my life at Agincourt.

690
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:41,260
I'd rather die than use magic.

691
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:44,140
You will die if that arrow
stays in you much longer.

692
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:11,020
Well, at least this
won't bother us anymore.

693
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:15,820
Now, let's go to the battle!

694
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:21,540
Please!

695
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:26,340
She's nuts.

696
01:15:26,820 --> 01:15:29,220
You must stay calm.
You must rest.

697
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:31,140
I'll rest.

698
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:33,060
But you have to...

699
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:34,980
promise me...

700
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:38,820
that you'll --
that you'll go back to the battle.

701
01:15:40,260 --> 01:15:41,700
I promise.

702
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:53,220
Hurry!

703
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:54,180
Quickly!
Do something!

704
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:07,580
She's sleeping.

705
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:09,500
What?

706
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:21,980
Come on back!
Why are you running away?

707
01:16:25,340 --> 01:16:26,780
- Jeanne is alive.
- Good.

708
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:30,620
- We have to press on the attack.
- Sound the retreat.

709
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:32,540
- I promised Jeanne we'd fight on.
- I made no such promise.

710
01:16:33,020 --> 01:16:36,380
- Sound the retreat for the night.
- No, that was her order.

711
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:39,260
I'm fed up
with taking her orders!

712
01:16:39,740 --> 01:16:42,100
She swore she'd defeat
the English before nightfall!

713
01:16:42,580 --> 01:16:45,940
Instead, she goes and plays the fool,
gets herself nearly killed!

714
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:48,820
Look!
Look at the mess we're in!

715
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:50,740
That's her mess, not mine!

716
01:16:51,220 --> 01:16:53,620
We are worse off
than if she'd never come at all.

717
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:57,460
Now do as I say
and sound the retreat!

718
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:08,020
Where are you going?
Hey, come back!

719
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:09,940
Come back and fight!

720
01:17:29,580 --> 01:17:31,980
- What are you making?
- A message for the English.

721
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:39,660
So, what are the men saying?

722
01:17:40,140 --> 01:17:42,540
She's a gift from God.

723
01:17:43,020 --> 01:17:45,420
Some even call her a saint.

724
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:49,260
- I'd gladly follow her through hell.
- Will you go that far if she asks you?

725
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:52,140
Of course I will,
and I've been there before.

726
01:17:58,380 --> 01:17:58,860
There's one thing
I don't quite understand.

727
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:01,700
She's been sent to us by God.

728
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:05,540
Why does He allow her
to be wounded so badly?

729
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:09,380
Maybe the good question is,
is she really sent by God?

730
01:18:12,740 --> 01:18:14,180
Who knows?

731
01:18:14,660 --> 01:18:17,060
God knows.

732
01:19:14,140 --> 01:19:16,540
Ooh.
A woman with a sword.

733
01:19:23,700 --> 01:19:26,100
You've hurt my feelings.

734
01:20:21,260 --> 01:20:22,700
Frenchies!

735
01:20:23,180 --> 01:20:24,620
What happened to your precious angel?

736
01:20:26,060 --> 01:20:29,420
Huh?
Frenchies! Frenchies!

737
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:32,300
I'll tell you what happened!

738
01:20:32,780 --> 01:20:35,180
We sent the little bitch
back to hell...

739
01:20:36,620 --> 01:20:39,940
so she can go fuck
with the devil!

740
01:20:42,340 --> 01:20:45,700
What are you gonna do now,
Frenchies?

741
01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:49,540
Why not come out and fight?
Come on!

742
01:20:50,020 --> 01:20:53,380
Come on!
Bastards, wake up!

743
01:20:53,860 --> 01:20:56,260
Or are you too busy praying...

744
01:20:56,740 --> 01:21:00,100
to bring your little fucking witch
back from the dead?

745
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:03,940
Do you hear me?

746
01:21:06,340 --> 01:21:07,780
I hear you!

747
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:13,540
I'm alive!

748
01:21:17,860 --> 01:21:20,220
May God forgive your blasphemy...

749
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:25,020
for I never will.

750
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:30,780
I never will!

751
01:21:40,860 --> 01:21:42,300
What are you doing?
You need to rest.

752
01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:45,180
We must wake up the soldiers, now!

753
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:47,100
My fine soldiers, wake up!

754
01:21:50,460 --> 01:21:51,900
To arms!
To arms!

755
01:21:52,380 --> 01:21:55,740
Wake up! Wake up!
We must fight the battle!

756
01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:02,420
My fine soldiers,
the battle has begun!

757
01:22:08,660 --> 01:22:10,100
Wake up!
The time has come!

758
01:22:14,420 --> 01:22:16,820
The battle has begun!

759
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:18,740
- To arms!
- Yes?

760
01:22:19,220 --> 01:22:23,540
My soldiers, we need this tower up!
We need this tower up, now!

761
01:22:29,780 --> 01:22:31,220
Pull!

762
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:38,900
- What's going on?
- We're taking back the Tourelles.

763
01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:49,420
Get ready!

764
01:22:58,540 --> 01:22:59,980
Go wake up Glasdale.

765
01:23:15,820 --> 01:23:18,220
- What are you doing?
- Sending a message to Glasdale.

766
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:21,060
- With that?
- Yes.

767
01:23:21,540 --> 01:23:23,940
But you've got it back-to-front.

768
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:25,860
Listen, I know what I'm doing...

769
01:23:26,340 --> 01:23:29,700
so either lend a hand
or get back to bed.

770
01:23:30,180 --> 01:23:33,540
I'm going to send a message
to Glasdale too.

771
01:23:38,820 --> 01:23:39,300
My lord?

772
01:23:40,740 --> 01:23:41,220
What?

773
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:46,020
The French witch,
she's back from the dead.

774
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:47,940
Hurry up, men!

775
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:52,740
Don't you think we should take
some time to think about this?

776
01:23:53,220 --> 01:23:54,660
Sooner is better than later.

777
01:24:01,820 --> 01:24:04,220
To arms!
To arms!

778
01:24:04,700 --> 01:24:05,180
Good morning.

779
01:24:11,420 --> 01:24:12,860
This one.

780
01:24:16,220 --> 01:24:17,660
What the fuck is she playing at?

781
01:24:18,140 --> 01:24:21,500
I don't know! The question is,
what is she doing now?

782
01:24:21,980 --> 01:24:24,380
How can we plan anything
if she doesn't consult with us?

783
01:24:24,860 --> 01:24:27,260
- Did we consult with her yesterday?
- Don't even start.

784
01:24:27,740 --> 01:24:30,140
- You agreed to attack yesterday too.
- Yes, but that doesn't count.

785
01:24:30,620 --> 01:24:32,060
- Why is that?
- Because I always agree to attack.

786
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:33,980
To arms!

787
01:24:41,140 --> 01:24:43,540
Crazy bitch.

788
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:45,460
She doesn't even know
how to use it.

789
01:24:57,460 --> 01:24:58,900
Oh, my God!

790
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:10,420
- Fuck! Close the doors!
- Close the doors!

791
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:23,820
- Open the door!
- Load the porcupine!

792
01:25:32,940 --> 01:25:33,420
Pull!

793
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:50,700
And pull!

794
01:25:54,060 --> 01:25:55,500
Come on!
Hurry up!

795
01:26:08,420 --> 01:26:08,900
Come on!

796
01:26:23,780 --> 01:26:26,180
Never wait for miracles.
Stay there.

797
01:26:31,460 --> 01:26:32,900
French whore!
Come and get me!

798
01:26:36,260 --> 01:26:37,700
What are you waiting for?

799
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:42,460
Yes? Oh, Jeanne!

800
01:26:44,860 --> 01:26:46,300
Find your archers
and burn that door!

801
01:26:46,780 --> 01:26:48,220
Right away!

802
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:53,980
Push!

803
01:27:02,140 --> 01:27:04,540
Prepare the gate!
Come on!

804
01:27:05,020 --> 01:27:06,460
Position!

805
01:27:09,820 --> 01:27:10,300
Fire!

806
01:27:16,540 --> 01:27:17,980
Water!

807
01:27:18,460 --> 01:27:18,940
Fire!

808
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:27,540
Oh, my God!

809
01:27:34,740 --> 01:27:35,220
Kill her.

810
01:27:38,580 --> 01:27:40,980
Fuck. Reload!

811
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:41,940
More archers!

812
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:09,740
Perfect.

813
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:14,540
More archers!

814
01:28:15,020 --> 01:28:15,500
Help me!

815
01:28:26,540 --> 01:28:28,940
Get your men!
We'll load this up as a battering ram!

816
01:28:29,420 --> 01:28:30,860
Already done.

817
01:29:02,980 --> 01:29:04,420
- What?
- Nothing.

818
01:29:09,700 --> 01:29:12,100
Help me with these men, please.

819
01:29:12,580 --> 01:29:14,020
Yes.

820
01:29:16,420 --> 01:29:16,900
As you command.

821
01:29:28,860 --> 01:29:30,300
Wait.
What are you doing?

822
01:29:30,780 --> 01:29:34,140
We're going to open that door.
Isn't that what you want?

823
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:38,940
Get out of my fucking way!

824
01:29:44,220 --> 01:29:45,660
Fill the cauldron!

825
01:29:49,020 --> 01:29:50,460
Fucking French!
What the fuck do you know about me?

826
01:29:57,660 --> 01:29:59,100
Reload.
Reload!

827
01:30:05,300 --> 01:30:08,660
Fill the fucking cauldron!
What are you waiting for?

828
01:30:12,980 --> 01:30:15,380
More men!
More men!

829
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:28,820
Ready!

830
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:54,700
Pour the oil!
Pour the oil!

831
01:31:46,980 --> 01:31:49,380
What are you doing, Jeanne?

832
01:31:51,780 --> 01:31:53,220
I'm playing.

833
01:32:11,900 --> 01:32:14,300
What are you doing
to me, Jeanne?

834
01:32:31,100 --> 01:32:32,540
Do you hear me?

835
01:32:33,020 --> 01:32:34,460
Are you all right?

836
01:32:34,940 --> 01:32:37,340
Do you hear me?
Calm down.

837
01:32:37,820 --> 01:32:39,220
It's over.

838
01:32:39,700 --> 01:32:41,140
We won.

839
01:32:41,620 --> 01:32:43,060
- We won?
- Yes.

840
01:32:50,260 --> 01:32:52,660
Fucking bitch.

841
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:58,420
My friend! My soldier!
In my arms.

842
01:33:01,780 --> 01:33:03,220
- We won?
- Won?

843
01:33:03,700 --> 01:33:07,060
No. No, Jeanne.
So small a word will never do.

844
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:09,940
This is victory!

845
01:33:10,420 --> 01:33:12,820
This is glory!

846
01:33:39,180 --> 01:33:40,620
What's the matter?

847
01:33:44,940 --> 01:33:46,380
This is glory?

848
01:33:50,700 --> 01:33:52,140
Doesn't matter.

849
01:33:58,380 --> 01:34:00,740
This is not possible.

850
01:34:14,660 --> 01:34:15,140
It is not possible.

851
01:34:15,620 --> 01:34:18,980
You look disappointed.
Isn't this what you wanted?

852
01:34:19,460 --> 01:34:22,820
No.
Not like this.

853
01:34:23,300 --> 01:34:25,700
For weeks you've been asking for this.

854
01:34:26,180 --> 01:34:28,580
Well, now you have it.

855
01:34:36,740 --> 01:34:38,180
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

856
01:34:38,660 --> 01:34:40,060
I'm just taking his teeth.

857
01:34:42,460 --> 01:34:44,860
But you just can't kill a man
for his teeth.

858
01:34:45,340 --> 01:34:46,780
Why not? He has good teeth.

859
01:34:49,180 --> 01:34:50,620
Because--
Because you can't!

860
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:54,460
What about all this?

861
01:34:54,940 --> 01:34:56,380
But that's different.

862
01:34:57,820 --> 01:35:00,220
I mean, we were fighting for a cause.

863
01:35:00,700 --> 01:35:04,060
Not me.
He's my prisoner...

864
01:35:04,540 --> 01:35:05,020
I can take his teeth
if I want to.

865
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:08,860
No, you can't!
Stop it!

866
01:35:09,340 --> 01:35:10,780
Here. Take this!

867
01:35:12,220 --> 01:35:14,620
He's mine now.
Here, you.

868
01:35:15,100 --> 01:35:16,540
Go.

869
01:35:18,900 --> 01:35:21,300
Bravo. And what about
all the other prisoners?

870
01:35:21,780 --> 01:35:24,180
- Do we let them go too?
- I don't know.

871
01:35:26,580 --> 01:35:27,060
Maybe.

872
01:35:35,220 --> 01:35:38,580
We must confess.
We must confess.

873
01:35:40,980 --> 01:35:43,380
Please, we have to be confessed.
All of us.

874
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:51,060
I know this is not normal custom...

875
01:35:51,540 --> 01:35:52,980
but, uh--

876
01:35:57,300 --> 01:35:59,660
Everything's gonna be fine.
He's gonna confess us.

877
01:36:03,020 --> 01:36:05,420
Kneel. Kneel.

878
01:36:16,460 --> 01:36:17,900
Alençon brings bad news.

879
01:36:18,380 --> 01:36:21,740
Thousands of English are forming up
on the far side of the river.

880
01:36:22,220 --> 01:36:24,620
I think we should count our men
and get ready.

881
01:36:26,060 --> 01:36:26,540
Let's go.

882
01:37:05,380 --> 01:37:05,860
I'll go.

883
01:37:09,220 --> 01:37:11,620
Alone.

884
01:37:38,940 --> 01:37:41,340
I have a message for your King Henry!

885
01:37:42,780 --> 01:37:45,180
It is a message from God!

886
01:37:45,660 --> 01:37:47,100
Go home!

887
01:37:50,460 --> 01:37:52,860
Go now, in peace!

888
01:37:54,300 --> 01:37:56,700
If you do not go now,
you will be buried in this field!

889
01:38:00,020 --> 01:38:04,340
I've seen enough blood!

890
01:38:06,740 --> 01:38:08,180
But if you want more...

891
01:38:09,620 --> 01:38:11,060
I can't stop you!

892
01:38:12,500 --> 01:38:15,860
I can only warn you
that it will be your blood...

893
01:38:18,260 --> 01:38:18,740
not ours!

894
01:38:21,140 --> 01:38:23,540
I'm waiting for your answer.

895
01:38:39,340 --> 01:38:41,740
Never wait for miracles.
Stand by to attack.

896
01:38:54,700 --> 01:38:56,140
Please.

897
01:39:03,340 --> 01:39:04,780
My Lord...

898
01:39:06,220 --> 01:39:06,700
please.

899
01:39:37,860 --> 01:39:40,260
Now that's what I call
a goddamn bloody miracle.

900
01:39:40,740 --> 01:39:42,180
She was on her white horse alone...

901
01:39:42,660 --> 01:39:45,060
facing the whole English army,
and she drove them away...

902
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:47,940
and now Orléans is free.

903
01:39:58,020 --> 01:39:59,420
We lost Orléans.

904
01:40:00,860 --> 01:40:02,300
I want that girl.

905
01:40:05,660 --> 01:40:09,020
I want that girl burned.

906
01:40:28,700 --> 01:40:31,100
May I see the seamstress?
It's too tight. I can't breathe.

907
01:40:31,580 --> 01:40:34,940
That's meant to be a crown?
Don't you have something more regal?

908
01:40:35,420 --> 01:40:36,860
The English took the real one.

909
01:40:37,340 --> 01:40:39,700
It's been muddy so long I forgot
how good it looked cleaned up.

910
01:40:40,180 --> 01:40:42,580
But did you remember to clean up
what's inside as well?

911
01:40:43,060 --> 01:40:46,420
I ask for a grandiose coronation,
and this is what you give?

912
01:40:46,900 --> 01:40:48,340
This whole thing is going to be
an utter fiasco!

913
01:40:49,780 --> 01:40:52,180
You gave me 3 days to prepare.
Your father's coronation took 3 months.

914
01:40:52,660 --> 01:40:54,100
He's right.
We should call for a delay.

915
01:40:54,580 --> 01:40:56,020
No time.
We can't hold up the ceremony.

916
01:40:56,500 --> 01:40:57,940
No telling when the English
might come back.

917
01:40:58,420 --> 01:41:00,820
Let them come. Let them see
who is the true king of France.

918
01:41:10,900 --> 01:41:14,260
Those damn English. We should be
doing this in Paris in Notre Dame.

919
01:41:14,740 --> 01:41:16,180
It is much more prestigious
and twice as big.

920
01:41:16,660 --> 01:41:19,020
It is the sacred place that matters,
not the size. Correct, Bishop?

921
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:22,860
Yes, my lady.
True kings of France must be anointed...

922
01:41:23,340 --> 01:41:25,740
in our great cathedral of Reims
with the holy oil of Clovis.

923
01:41:36,780 --> 01:41:39,180
Your Grace!
There can be no anointing.

924
01:41:39,660 --> 01:41:43,020
- What are you talking about?
- The holy oil of Clovis is all gone.

925
01:41:43,500 --> 01:41:44,940
Gone?
That's impossible.

926
01:41:45,420 --> 01:41:48,780
It's a magic oil. A miraculous oil.
It can never be exhausted.

927
01:41:49,260 --> 01:41:50,700
- Look for yourself.
- Problem?

928
01:41:51,180 --> 01:41:52,620
I just don't understand.

929
01:41:53,100 --> 01:41:55,500
The oil of Clovis. It was quite full
the last time I saw it.

930
01:41:55,980 --> 01:41:59,300
- And when was that?
- At the coronation of King Charles VI.

931
01:41:59,780 --> 01:42:02,180
Thirty years ago?
Does it surprise you it's gone?

932
01:42:02,660 --> 01:42:05,060
But you don't understand.

933
01:42:05,540 --> 01:42:08,900
It's no ordinary oil.
It's a miraculous oil.

934
01:42:09,380 --> 01:42:12,740
It was brought
by a white dove from heaven...

935
01:42:13,220 --> 01:42:14,660
to crown King Clovis
in this very cathedral.

936
01:42:17,060 --> 01:42:19,460
- What are you doing?
- Performing a miracle.

937
01:43:36,660 --> 01:43:40,020
With this sacred oil, blessed by
the hand of God the Father Almighty...

938
01:43:40,500 --> 01:43:42,900
we do anoint thee, Charles Valois...

939
01:43:43,380 --> 01:43:47,700
to be sovereign lord and king
of this great kingdom of France...

940
01:43:48,180 --> 01:43:51,540
charging that we should defend
the faith of our Mother Holy Church...

941
01:43:52,980 --> 01:43:54,420
as long as we shall live.

942
01:43:55,860 --> 01:43:57,300
Amen.

943
01:44:30,380 --> 01:44:31,820
Long live the king!

944
01:44:49,540 --> 01:44:52,900
- Jeanne, are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

945
01:44:55,300 --> 01:44:58,660
- Why are you staring at me?
- You have an arrow in your leg.

946
01:45:04,900 --> 01:45:05,380
So there is.

947
01:45:07,780 --> 01:45:09,220
But that doesn't stop you
from climbing!

948
01:45:10,660 --> 01:45:14,020
Well, climb! Go! Go!

949
01:45:19,260 --> 01:45:20,700
Take this arrow out of my leg.

950
01:45:25,980 --> 01:45:27,420
Look out!

951
01:45:28,860 --> 01:45:32,220
- Be careful!
- Jeanne, the men are exhausted.

952
01:45:32,700 --> 01:45:35,100
I know, but so is the enemy.
They're falling back. Paris is ours.

953
01:45:35,580 --> 01:45:37,020
Jeanne, we are not enough.

954
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:39,900
So bring up the reinforcements.

955
01:45:40,380 --> 01:45:41,820
Reinforcements? Where?

956
01:45:43,260 --> 01:45:44,700
Right behind us.

957
01:45:45,180 --> 01:45:47,580
Dunois with another 10,000 men.

958
01:45:48,060 --> 01:45:50,460
- Jeanne, look behind you.
- Never look behind. Only ahead.

959
01:45:52,860 --> 01:45:55,260
Do you know how to count?

960
01:45:57,660 --> 01:46:00,980
Of course I do!
So, bring them up!

961
01:46:04,340 --> 01:46:07,700
Jeanne, that is not
10,000 reinforcements!

962
01:46:08,180 --> 01:46:09,620
That is 100...

963
01:46:10,100 --> 01:46:12,500
very loyal
but very tired soldiers!

964
01:46:14,900 --> 01:46:16,340
But where's Dunois?

965
01:46:16,820 --> 01:46:18,260
And where are the men
the king promised me?

966
01:46:18,740 --> 01:46:22,100
He never sent them!
Don't you understand?

967
01:46:22,580 --> 01:46:24,020
He doesn't want this war anymore.

968
01:46:24,500 --> 01:46:26,900
He has his crown now.
That's all he ever wanted.

969
01:46:28,340 --> 01:46:31,700
But my voices, they promised me.

970
01:46:32,180 --> 01:46:33,620
To hell with your voices!

971
01:46:36,980 --> 01:46:39,340
It's time to face facts!

972
01:46:41,740 --> 01:46:44,140
We have nothing to do here!

973
01:46:44,620 --> 01:46:46,060
None of us!

974
01:46:48,460 --> 01:46:49,900
Not even you.

975
01:46:55,180 --> 01:46:57,580
You don't believe in me anymore?

976
01:46:58,060 --> 01:47:00,460
Jeanne, of course we still
believe in you.

977
01:47:00,940 --> 01:47:04,300
If it were up to me, I'd chase every
goddamn Englishman into the ocean.

978
01:47:04,780 --> 01:47:07,180
But it's not up to us anymore.

979
01:47:07,660 --> 01:47:09,100
It's up to the king.

980
01:47:21,060 --> 01:47:22,500
You should go home, Jeanne.

981
01:47:37,380 --> 01:47:39,780
We cannot possibly afford to pay
for the size of army she's demanding.

982
01:47:41,220 --> 01:47:41,700
Girl is crazy.

983
01:47:44,100 --> 01:47:45,540
Her victory at Orléans
was a miracle.

984
01:47:46,020 --> 01:47:49,380
But we can't wait for a miracle
when we build a future for France.

985
01:47:51,780 --> 01:47:54,180
Paris was a disaster.

986
01:47:54,660 --> 01:47:56,100
God wasn't with her then.

987
01:47:56,580 --> 01:47:58,940
If God deserts her,
what do you think we should do?

988
01:48:10,940 --> 01:48:14,300
Why did you betray me? Paris was ours.
All I needed was a few hundred men.

989
01:48:14,780 --> 01:48:19,100
- Why did you take the army you gave me?
- Gave you?

990
01:48:19,580 --> 01:48:21,980
- I wouldn't quite put it that way.
- So how would you put it?

991
01:48:27,260 --> 01:48:30,620
We are, of course,
enormously grateful...

992
01:48:31,100 --> 01:48:32,540
for your past efforts...

993
01:48:33,020 --> 01:48:35,420
but now your task is done.

994
01:48:35,900 --> 01:48:37,340
Now is the time for negotiation.

995
01:48:37,820 --> 01:48:40,180
Peace will only be got with the English
by the end of a lance.

996
01:48:40,660 --> 01:48:44,020
Why are you so blood thirsty?
Doy ou enjoy it?

997
01:48:47,380 --> 01:48:48,820
Diplomacy is far more civilized...

998
01:48:49,300 --> 01:48:51,700
far safer and far cheaper.

999
01:48:59,860 --> 01:49:04,180
I've letters here from towns under
siege, where your people are starving...

1000
01:49:04,660 --> 01:49:07,060
begging God on their knees
to help them.

1001
01:49:07,540 --> 01:49:10,900
I'm here to answer their prayers.
And you want to stop me?

1002
01:49:13,300 --> 01:49:15,700
France does not belong to you, Charles.

1003
01:49:16,180 --> 01:49:18,540
She belongs to God.

1004
01:49:29,580 --> 01:49:31,020
If only she would just go home.

1005
01:49:50,700 --> 01:49:52,140
So what am I supposed to do now?

1006
01:49:53,580 --> 01:49:55,980
- What do your voices say?
- They haven't spoken to me in weeks.

1007
01:49:56,460 --> 01:49:58,820
Not since the coronation.

1008
01:49:59,300 --> 01:50:00,740
No signs, nothing.

1009
01:50:02,180 --> 01:50:03,620
Maybe their silence is a sign.

1010
01:50:06,020 --> 01:50:07,460
- Maybe it's a sign to go home.
- No.

1011
01:50:07,940 --> 01:50:10,340
It's not time yet.
My mission isn't over yet.

1012
01:50:12,740 --> 01:50:16,100
- There's still more I have to do.
- But how do--

1013
01:50:16,580 --> 01:50:18,020
How do you know that these--

1014
01:50:18,500 --> 01:50:20,900
these voices aren't just really you?

1015
01:50:22,340 --> 01:50:26,660
Well, they are me.
That's how God speaks to me.

1016
01:50:28,100 --> 01:50:31,460
Even you could hear them
if you listened hard enough.

1017
01:50:33,860 --> 01:50:35,300
You make it sound so simple.

1018
01:50:36,740 --> 01:50:39,100
So even you don't believe in me anymore.

1019
01:50:39,580 --> 01:50:43,900
Jeanne, I believe in you
more than anyone.

1020
01:50:44,380 --> 01:50:46,780
I just wish I could...

1021
01:50:47,260 --> 01:50:48,700
help you.

1022
01:50:50,140 --> 01:50:51,580
There is one thing you can do
if you want to help me.

1023
01:50:53,020 --> 01:50:53,500
Tell me.

1024
01:50:53,980 --> 01:50:55,420
Tell the king to give back
the army that he gave me.

1025
01:51:06,460 --> 01:51:07,900
We have to stop her, Your Majesty.

1026
01:51:08,380 --> 01:51:11,740
If she raises an army
and attacks the Burgundians...

1027
01:51:12,220 --> 01:51:14,620
months of negotiations
will have been in vain.

1028
01:51:16,060 --> 01:51:17,500
Jeanne has done so much for us.

1029
01:51:17,940 --> 01:51:21,300
I can assure you, the maid has
no greater admirer than myself.

1030
01:51:21,780 --> 01:51:24,180
Whatever our personal feelings,
we cannot allow her to conduct...

1031
01:51:24,660 --> 01:51:27,060
her own private war.

1032
01:51:27,540 --> 01:51:30,900
For the sake of the kingdom, you must
stop her from going to Compiègne.

1033
01:51:31,380 --> 01:51:32,820
I can't stop her.

1034
01:51:33,300 --> 01:51:38,580
Well, if you don't, I'm sure the
Burgundians would be happy to oblige.

1035
01:51:39,060 --> 01:51:40,500
If they capture her at Compiègne--

1036
01:51:40,980 --> 01:51:42,420
No one could blame us.

1037
01:51:44,820 --> 01:51:49,140
But it could sound like
we betrayed her.

1038
01:51:49,620 --> 01:51:52,020
- No, never.
- Good heavens, no.

1039
01:51:52,500 --> 01:51:53,940
Don't worry, Charles.

1040
01:51:56,340 --> 01:52:00,620
If God is still with her,
she will be victorious.

1041
01:52:01,100 --> 01:52:02,540
But her army's so much smaller.

1042
01:52:03,020 --> 01:52:05,420
Then her faith will have to be bigger.

1043
01:52:19,340 --> 01:52:22,700
- What are you doing? Open this gate.
- I can't risk the safety of my town.

1044
01:52:26,060 --> 01:52:26,540
Take my banner!

1045
01:53:22,620 --> 01:53:24,060
My Lord.

1046
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:26,940
My Lord.

1047
01:53:51,420 --> 01:53:52,860
I can't believe it.

1048
01:53:53,340 --> 01:53:57,660
Your romantic vision of death
with all that grass growing everywhere.

1049
01:53:58,100 --> 01:53:59,540
I must admit,
you have a big imagination.

1050
01:54:00,020 --> 01:54:02,420
But maybe not big enough.

1051
01:54:02,900 --> 01:54:06,260
Death is much more simple.

1052
01:54:10,580 --> 01:54:12,980
After a few months,
it gets more interesting.

1053
01:54:16,340 --> 01:54:19,700
Then after a year,
it finally becomes...

1054
01:54:22,100 --> 01:54:23,540
romantic.

1055
01:54:28,820 --> 01:54:29,300
Who are you?

1056
01:54:29,780 --> 01:54:32,180
You don't like my face?

1057
01:54:32,660 --> 01:54:35,060
Maybe you'd prefer this one.

1058
01:54:38,380 --> 01:54:39,820
Too young, maybe.

1059
01:54:40,300 --> 01:54:42,700
How about this one?

1060
01:54:44,140 --> 01:54:48,460
Better now? But incomplete.

1061
01:54:54,700 --> 01:54:57,100
Get thee behind me, Satan.

1062
01:54:57,580 --> 01:55:01,900
Who are you to even think you can know
the difference between good and evil?

1063
01:55:04,300 --> 01:55:04,780
Are you God?

1064
01:55:09,100 --> 01:55:11,500
I'm just a messenger.

1065
01:55:11,980 --> 01:55:13,420
He needs me.

1066
01:55:13,900 --> 01:55:17,260
How can you imagine that God,
the creator of heaven and Earth...

1067
01:55:17,700 --> 01:55:19,140
the source of all life...

1068
01:55:19,620 --> 01:55:22,980
could possibly need you?

1069
01:55:24,420 --> 01:55:24,900
I don't know.

1070
01:55:26,340 --> 01:55:27,780
You don't think He's big enough
to deliver His own messages?

1071
01:55:29,220 --> 01:55:31,620
What do you want from me?

1072
01:55:32,100 --> 01:55:33,540
Nothing.
I'm here to set you free.

1073
01:55:36,900 --> 01:55:38,340
I said smile.
You have visitors.

1074
01:55:38,820 --> 01:55:40,260
The Duke of Burgundy.

1075
01:55:52,260 --> 01:55:54,660
So here's the famous Jeanne...

1076
01:55:55,140 --> 01:55:57,540
savior of Orléans,
terror of the English.

1077
01:55:57,980 --> 01:56:01,340
My king will pay
any ransom you ask.

1078
01:56:01,820 --> 01:56:05,180
Your king?
Oh, yes, of course.

1079
01:56:05,660 --> 01:56:07,100
What's he gonna pay me with?
Cows? Chickens?

1080
01:56:08,540 --> 01:56:10,940
I prefer gold,
and the English have plenty.

1081
01:56:12,380 --> 01:56:15,740
I wonder how much they'll pay to have
the witch of Orléans in their clutches.

1082
01:56:16,220 --> 01:56:20,540
The English are so arrogant, they can't
accept being defeated by a peasant girl.

1083
01:56:21,020 --> 01:56:23,420
It has to have been the devil's work.

1084
01:56:23,900 --> 01:56:25,340
God defeated the English.

1085
01:56:25,820 --> 01:56:28,220
And God allowed you to be caught?

1086
01:56:29,660 --> 01:56:31,100
Personally, I don't believe in God.

1087
01:56:31,580 --> 01:56:33,980
I don't believe in the devil either.

1088
01:56:34,460 --> 01:56:36,860
That's why I'm never disappointed.

1089
01:56:39,220 --> 01:56:39,700
Sell her.

1090
01:56:56,500 --> 01:56:57,940
To pay Jeanne's ransom.

1091
01:56:58,420 --> 01:57:00,820
The captains gave what they could,
as well as citizens of Orléans.

1092
01:57:01,300 --> 01:57:05,620
That's very generous of you.
How much?

1093
01:57:06,100 --> 01:57:08,500
- Ten thousand gold crowns.
- Ten thousand?

1094
01:57:08,980 --> 01:57:10,420
That's a lot.

1095
01:57:10,900 --> 01:57:14,260
Your Grace, I place you in charge
of this very delicate negotiation.

1096
01:57:29,100 --> 01:57:31,500
Get yourself ready.
You're leaving.

1097
01:57:34,860 --> 01:57:35,340
Who are you?

1098
01:57:35,820 --> 01:57:39,180
Pierre Cauchon, bishop of Beauvais.

1099
01:57:39,660 --> 01:57:42,060
As you were captured in my diocese, the
duty to conduct the trial falls upon me.

1100
01:57:44,460 --> 01:57:46,860
Trial?
What trial?

1101
01:57:47,340 --> 01:57:50,700
Your trial, Jeanne,
on a charge of heresy.

1102
01:57:54,060 --> 01:57:55,500
But my king--

1103
01:57:57,860 --> 01:57:59,300
Didn't he pay my ransom?

1104
01:57:59,780 --> 01:58:02,180
It seems the English care
more about you than the French.

1105
01:58:02,660 --> 01:58:04,100
- The English?
- Yes.

1106
01:58:04,580 --> 01:58:06,020
They paid your ransom.

1107
01:58:06,500 --> 01:58:09,860
Tomorrow you'll be transferred
to their great castle at Rouen.

1108
01:59:09,820 --> 01:59:13,180
Our serene and Christian king, Henry VI,
king of England and France...

1109
01:59:13,660 --> 01:59:16,060
has placed this girl in our hands,
accused of heretical deeds...

1110
01:59:16,540 --> 01:59:17,940
to be tried in a matter of faith.

1111
01:59:18,420 --> 01:59:20,820
Take the Holy Gospels in your hand...

1112
01:59:21,300 --> 01:59:24,660
and swear to tell the truth regarding
anything you may be asked.

1113
01:59:26,100 --> 01:59:29,460
I don't know what you will ask me. You
may ask things I won't want to answer.

1114
01:59:29,940 --> 01:59:32,340
You will swear to tell the truth
about everything you are asked.

1115
01:59:33,780 --> 01:59:37,140
I will willingly tell the truth
about all Earthly things.

1116
01:59:37,620 --> 01:59:40,980
But as to my revelations,
I've told no one except my king...

1117
01:59:42,420 --> 01:59:44,820
Charles VII, the one and only
king of France.

1118
01:59:48,180 --> 01:59:49,620
You must take the oath.

1119
01:59:50,100 --> 01:59:53,460
Not even a king would refuse to take
an oath in a matter of faith.

1120
01:59:53,940 --> 01:59:55,380
I will tell you all
that I'm allowed to tell you.

1121
01:59:57,740 --> 01:59:59,180
But as for the rest...

1122
01:59:59,660 --> 02:00:02,060
even if you threatened
to cut off my head, I won't tell you.

1123
02:00:08,300 --> 02:00:11,660
Begin by telling us your name, assuming
you're allowed to tell us that much.

1124
02:00:14,060 --> 02:00:14,540
My name is Jeanne.

1125
02:00:16,940 --> 02:00:19,340
My little cross was taken from me.
May I have it back?

1126
02:00:19,820 --> 02:00:23,180
Show us a little more
cooperation first.

1127
02:00:23,660 --> 02:00:25,100
Where were you born?

1128
02:00:25,580 --> 02:00:27,980
In a village called Domremy.

1129
02:00:28,460 --> 02:00:29,900
How old are you?

1130
02:00:30,380 --> 02:00:31,820
Nineteen, or thereabouts.

1131
02:00:32,300 --> 02:00:33,740
Were you baptized?

1132
02:00:35,180 --> 02:00:37,540
- Yes.
- Recite our Lord's Prayer.

1133
02:00:39,940 --> 02:00:42,340
Not unless you hear my confession.

1134
02:00:46,660 --> 02:00:48,100
Listen to me very carefully.

1135
02:00:48,580 --> 02:00:50,980
We are all men of faith...

1136
02:00:51,460 --> 02:00:54,820
and we shall earnestly strive for the
salvation of your body and your soul...

1137
02:00:55,300 --> 02:00:59,620
in the name of our Church who never
closes arms to those who return to her.

1138
02:01:00,100 --> 02:01:01,540
But we cannot help you...

1139
02:01:02,020 --> 02:01:04,420
unless you submit to our
learned judgment and authority.

1140
02:01:04,900 --> 02:01:07,300
Take heed of this
charitable admonition...

1141
02:01:07,780 --> 02:01:10,180
for if you persist
in refusing our help...

1142
02:01:10,660 --> 02:01:14,020
we shall have no choice but to
abandon you to the secular powers.

1143
02:01:14,500 --> 02:01:16,900
And I think you know well enough
the punishment that would await you.

1144
02:01:23,100 --> 02:01:24,540
Now...

1145
02:01:25,020 --> 02:01:27,420
will you please recite
our Lord's Prayer?

1146
02:01:29,820 --> 02:01:32,220
Not unless you hear my confession.

1147
02:01:35,580 --> 02:01:39,900
Be careful. You aren't helping yourself
by refusing to submit to our judgment.

1148
02:01:40,380 --> 02:01:41,820
You...

1149
02:01:42,300 --> 02:01:44,700
who claim to be my judges,
you be careful!

1150
02:01:46,140 --> 02:01:48,540
For you too one day will be judged.

1151
02:01:49,020 --> 02:01:49,500
Guards, take the prisoner away!

1152
02:01:52,860 --> 02:01:55,260
- Silence!
- Sorceress!

1153
02:01:55,740 --> 02:01:58,100
Silence!
Clear the room!

1154
02:01:58,580 --> 02:02:00,980
Clear the room!

1155
02:02:03,380 --> 02:02:06,740
In future, we should conduct inquiries
privately, away from public pressure.

1156
02:02:07,220 --> 02:02:09,620
Let the English burn her if they want.
Why does it have to involve us?

1157
02:02:11,060 --> 02:02:13,460
Because it's our duty to root out
heresy wherever we find it.

1158
02:02:15,860 --> 02:02:16,340
Father Vincente.

1159
02:02:18,740 --> 02:02:20,180
You're the most venerable among us.
What do you think?

1160
02:02:21,620 --> 02:02:23,060
I think this trial is a masquerade...

1161
02:02:23,540 --> 02:02:25,940
and I won't be part of it anymore.

1162
02:02:26,420 --> 02:02:28,820
I'm willing to be her judge,
but not her executioner.

1163
02:02:29,300 --> 02:02:30,740
That's what I'm trying to ensure.

1164
02:02:34,100 --> 02:02:39,340
The verdict comes at the end of
a trial, Cauchon. Not at the beginning.

1165
02:02:41,740 --> 02:02:43,180
I am going back to Rome...

1166
02:02:43,660 --> 02:02:46,060
to give my report
to our Holy Father, the Pope.

1167
02:02:49,420 --> 02:02:52,780
This is ridiculous. Now I'm the one
who's on trial and being judged.

1168
02:02:53,260 --> 02:02:54,700
- Arrest him.
- What are you doing?

1169
02:02:56,140 --> 02:02:58,540
This is an ecclesiastical court.
You've no right to do this.

1170
02:02:59,020 --> 02:03:00,460
This is English territory.

1171
02:03:00,940 --> 02:03:02,380
I have the right to do anything.

1172
02:03:02,860 --> 02:03:04,300
Is that clear?

1173
02:03:21,060 --> 02:03:21,540
Our Father who art in heaven--

1174
02:03:22,020 --> 02:03:23,460
Thy kingdom come--

1175
02:03:28,740 --> 02:03:30,180
Forgive us--
Forgive them--

1176
02:03:30,660 --> 02:03:34,020
Forgive them, then forgive us.
Forgive them.

1177
02:03:34,500 --> 02:03:34,980
Why were you yelling?

1178
02:03:40,260 --> 02:03:43,620
What are you doing here?
You can't stay here! Go away!

1179
02:03:44,100 --> 02:03:46,500
Why? Are you waiting for someone else?

1180
02:03:47,940 --> 02:03:48,420
Yes.

1181
02:03:49,860 --> 02:03:51,300
- Who?
- My visions.

1182
02:03:51,780 --> 02:03:53,220
Your visions.

1183
02:03:54,660 --> 02:03:56,100
They're going to visit you in here?

1184
02:03:56,580 --> 02:03:58,940
Yes. That's what I pray for.

1185
02:04:00,380 --> 02:04:02,780
I want to see that.
Do you mind if I stay on the side here?

1186
02:04:03,260 --> 02:04:04,700
- I won't bother you.
- No!

1187
02:04:06,140 --> 02:04:07,580
No, you can't! You can't!

1188
02:04:08,060 --> 02:04:09,500
- Or else they won't come.
- Why won't they?

1189
02:04:09,980 --> 02:04:11,420
Because I have to be alone.

1190
02:04:11,900 --> 02:04:15,260
Oh. They won't come anyway.

1191
02:04:16,700 --> 02:04:19,100
- What do you mean, they won't come?
- Why would they?

1192
02:04:20,540 --> 02:04:22,940
Because I've always been faithful
to God...

1193
02:04:23,420 --> 02:04:24,860
and I've followed everything
He's ever said...

1194
02:04:25,340 --> 02:04:26,780
and I've done everything
He's ever asked me to do.

1195
02:04:27,260 --> 02:04:28,700
God asked you to do something?

1196
02:04:33,020 --> 02:04:34,460
Yes, lots of things.

1197
02:04:34,940 --> 02:04:37,300
You mean, God said...

1198
02:04:37,780 --> 02:04:39,220
''I need you, Jeanne''?

1199
02:04:42,580 --> 02:04:44,980
But He's sent me signs.

1200
02:04:47,380 --> 02:04:48,820
Signs? What signs?

1201
02:04:51,220 --> 02:04:52,660
The wind. The wind.

1202
02:04:57,940 --> 02:04:58,420
Wind.

1203
02:04:58,900 --> 02:05:01,300
And the clouds. Ringing.

1204
02:05:03,700 --> 02:05:05,140
Ringing cloud.

1205
02:05:06,580 --> 02:05:08,020
The dance. The dance.

1206
02:05:21,900 --> 02:05:24,300
The sword. The sword lying in the field.

1207
02:05:25,740 --> 02:05:26,220
That was a sign.

1208
02:05:26,700 --> 02:05:30,060
No. That was a sword in a field.

1209
02:05:31,500 --> 02:05:33,900
No. No. That was a sign.

1210
02:05:34,380 --> 02:05:36,780
No, that was a sword in a field.

1211
02:05:37,260 --> 02:05:40,620
It can't just get there by itself.
It can't.

1212
02:05:41,100 --> 02:05:43,500
A sword just doesn't get there
by itself.

1213
02:05:43,980 --> 02:05:48,300
True. Every event has an infinite
number of causes, so why pick one?

1214
02:05:48,780 --> 02:05:50,220
There are many ways a sword
might find itself in a field.

1215
02:05:56,460 --> 02:05:58,820
Seems a perfectly valid explanation,
but how about this one?

1216
02:06:05,060 --> 02:06:06,500
Then again, there are other
possibilities.

1217
02:06:11,780 --> 02:06:12,260
Or even faster.

1218
02:06:16,580 --> 02:06:18,980
And that's without counting
the inexplicable.

1219
02:06:21,380 --> 02:06:24,740
Yet from an infinite number of
possibilities, you had to pick this one.

1220
02:06:38,620 --> 02:06:41,980
You didn't see what was, Jeanne.

1221
02:06:42,460 --> 02:06:44,860
You saw what you wanted to see.

1222
02:07:01,660 --> 02:07:04,060
This voice that you say
appears to you...

1223
02:07:04,540 --> 02:07:08,860
is it an angel or a saint,
or does it come from God?

1224
02:07:09,340 --> 02:07:12,700
I won't tell you any more about that.

1225
02:07:13,180 --> 02:07:15,580
I'm more afraid of displeasing Him
than not answering you.

1226
02:07:16,060 --> 02:07:20,340
You're afraid of displeasing God
by telling the truth?

1227
02:07:20,820 --> 02:07:23,220
Did God forbid you
to tell the truth?

1228
02:07:23,700 --> 02:07:27,060
My revelations were for
the king of France, not for you.

1229
02:07:29,460 --> 02:07:31,860
When you saw your king
for the first time...

1230
02:07:32,340 --> 02:07:33,780
was there an angel over his head?

1231
02:07:34,260 --> 02:07:35,700
If there was one, I did not see it.

1232
02:07:36,180 --> 02:07:38,580
Why did your king believe in you
without any proof?

1233
02:07:40,020 --> 02:07:41,460
Go ask him yourself.

1234
02:07:54,420 --> 02:07:54,900
Dinner.

1235
02:08:11,660 --> 02:08:14,060
When you were taken prisoner,
did you have a horse?

1236
02:08:14,540 --> 02:08:16,940
Yes. A half-steed. Black.

1237
02:08:18,380 --> 02:08:19,820
- Who gave you that horse?
- My king.

1238
02:08:20,300 --> 02:08:22,700
How many did he give you?

1239
02:08:25,100 --> 02:08:26,540
Five steeds...

1240
02:08:27,020 --> 02:08:29,420
and a few hackneys.

1241
02:08:29,900 --> 02:08:32,300
As much as for a lord.
What an honor.

1242
02:08:32,780 --> 02:08:35,180
Did your king give you other wealth
apart from those horses?

1243
02:08:37,540 --> 02:08:39,940
What about all those dresses
you were given?

1244
02:08:40,420 --> 02:08:41,860
Silk dresses, weren't they?

1245
02:08:43,300 --> 02:08:43,780
Yes.

1246
02:08:44,260 --> 02:08:46,660
Yes, I was given a few.

1247
02:08:47,140 --> 02:08:50,500
But I never had time to wear them.

1248
02:08:50,980 --> 02:08:53,380
Still, pretty wealthy
for a peasant girl, wouldn't you say?

1249
02:08:56,740 --> 02:09:00,100
You look pretty wealthy
for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?

1250
02:09:05,380 --> 02:09:06,820
You launched an attack on Paris,
didn't you?

1251
02:09:07,300 --> 02:09:08,740
I tried to.

1252
02:09:10,180 --> 02:09:11,620
And didn't you order the citizens
of Paris to surrender the city...

1253
02:09:12,100 --> 02:09:12,580
in the name of the King of Heaven?

1254
02:09:13,060 --> 02:09:16,420
No. I said, ''Surrender in the name
of the king of France.''

1255
02:09:16,860 --> 02:09:19,260
That is not what is written
in the evidence.

1256
02:09:21,660 --> 02:09:22,140
Look yourself.

1257
02:09:22,620 --> 02:09:25,020
I can't read.

1258
02:09:27,420 --> 02:09:29,820
Yes, I forgot.

1259
02:09:30,300 --> 02:09:33,660
God sent us an illiterate peasant
to carry out such an important mission.

1260
02:09:34,140 --> 02:09:35,580
Do you think that God
made the right decision?

1261
02:09:36,060 --> 02:09:39,420
To take an ignorant girl
to save the kingdom of France?

1262
02:09:40,860 --> 02:09:41,340
I leave that answer to God.

1263
02:09:46,620 --> 02:09:48,060
Fuck!

1264
02:09:48,540 --> 02:09:49,980
Calm down, my lord.
I beg you.

1265
02:09:50,460 --> 02:09:52,860
How can I when I'm made
the laughing stock of the whole court?

1266
02:09:53,340 --> 02:09:54,780
You've seen how it is.
This girl has a way with people...

1267
02:09:55,260 --> 02:09:57,620
but we're making progress every day.

1268
02:09:58,100 --> 02:10:01,460
As long as that bitch remains alive,
our armies refuse to fight. Understand?

1269
02:10:01,940 --> 02:10:02,420
They need proof
that God is on their side.

1270
02:10:03,860 --> 02:10:05,300
It's not for us to burn her.
That's your prerogative.

1271
02:10:05,780 --> 02:10:07,220
And it's your prerogative
to find her guilty!

1272
02:10:07,700 --> 02:10:11,060
But we can't do that
unless she admits to blasphemy.

1273
02:10:11,540 --> 02:10:12,020
What are you waiting for?

1274
02:10:12,500 --> 02:10:15,860
You've got a castle full of racks,
ropes and pulleys. Torture the bitch!

1275
02:10:16,340 --> 02:10:18,740
You'll never get anything
out of her that way.

1276
02:10:19,220 --> 02:10:20,660
And besides...

1277
02:10:21,140 --> 02:10:26,420
you must realize that several
of my colleagues are, well, scared.

1278
02:10:26,900 --> 02:10:28,340
Scared? Of a girl?

1279
02:10:28,820 --> 02:10:31,220
Scared to make a mistake.

1280
02:10:31,700 --> 02:10:33,140
Suppose she's right.

1281
02:10:33,620 --> 02:10:36,020
Suppose she has been sent by God.

1282
02:10:40,300 --> 02:10:44,620
- Who's side are you on, Cauchon?
- I'm on the side of Holy Mother Church.

1283
02:10:46,060 --> 02:10:47,500
Do you have a sword?

1284
02:10:49,900 --> 02:10:51,340
- Quite a few.
- Didn't you also carry a banner?

1285
02:10:52,780 --> 02:10:54,220
Yes.

1286
02:10:54,700 --> 02:10:57,100
Which do you prefer?
Your banner or your sword?

1287
02:10:57,580 --> 02:10:59,020
I was 40 times more fond of my banner.

1288
02:10:59,500 --> 02:11:01,900
Why? Did it have some
particular value or power?

1289
02:11:05,260 --> 02:11:06,700
It's just--

1290
02:11:07,180 --> 02:11:09,580
- A sword is a weapon.
- And?

1291
02:11:11,020 --> 02:11:15,340
And so, I prefer my banner.

1292
02:11:15,820 --> 02:11:16,300
Why?

1293
02:11:16,740 --> 02:11:19,140
To avoid killing anyone.

1294
02:11:19,620 --> 02:11:22,020
Are you saying if you'd not
been carrying your banner...

1295
02:11:22,500 --> 02:11:23,940
you'd have killed more people?

1296
02:11:28,260 --> 02:11:29,700
Of course not.
I never killed anyone.

1297
02:11:30,180 --> 02:11:32,580
Then perhaps the temptation...

1298
02:11:33,060 --> 02:11:34,500
to kill would have been stronger--

1299
02:11:34,980 --> 02:11:36,420
too strong, perhaps.

1300
02:11:37,860 --> 02:11:39,300
I warned the English to go back home.

1301
02:11:39,780 --> 02:11:42,180
I begged them not to force us to fight.
They knew that I--

1302
02:11:42,660 --> 02:11:45,060
We have numerous witnesses
who can confirm...

1303
02:11:45,540 --> 02:11:46,980
you were not always
carrying your banner.

1304
02:11:51,300 --> 02:11:52,740
Yes, perhaps.

1305
02:11:53,220 --> 02:11:54,660
Sometimes you were carrying
just your sword.

1306
02:11:57,020 --> 02:11:57,500
Yes. I don't know.

1307
02:11:57,980 --> 02:12:00,380
Did you use the sword
you held in your hand?

1308
02:12:00,860 --> 02:12:02,300
Yes, I used it--
I held it up--

1309
02:12:02,780 --> 02:12:05,180
You held up your sword
and flourished it about like this!

1310
02:12:05,660 --> 02:12:06,140
I don't remember.

1311
02:12:06,620 --> 02:12:09,020
So, you were on the battlefield
with your sword in your hand...

1312
02:12:10,460 --> 02:12:12,860
waving it above your head,
charging against the enemy...

1313
02:12:13,340 --> 02:12:14,780
screaming at the enemy,
fighting for your life...

1314
02:12:15,260 --> 02:12:16,700
and you expect us to believe...

1315
02:12:17,180 --> 02:12:20,540
that in the middle
of all this excitement...

1316
02:12:21,020 --> 02:12:24,380
you never killed anyone.

1317
02:12:24,860 --> 02:12:27,260
No. I never killed anyone.

1318
02:12:29,660 --> 02:12:31,100
I can't believe
you can lie like that.

1319
02:12:31,580 --> 02:12:34,940
I'm not lying. I'm not lying.
Leave me alone. I can't remember.

1320
02:12:35,420 --> 02:12:37,780
-I didn't kill anyone. I can't remember.
-Let me help your memory.

1321
02:12:38,260 --> 02:12:40,660
I don't want to hear any more.
Leave me alone. I didn't kill that man.

1322
02:12:41,140 --> 02:12:42,580
Leave me alone!

1323
02:12:43,060 --> 02:12:45,460
Stop. Stop. I can't remember.

1324
02:12:45,940 --> 02:12:49,300
The battles were so confusing. I was
only defending myself as best I could.

1325
02:12:49,780 --> 02:12:53,140
There was so much dust, smoke and noise.
I was being attacked on all sides.

1326
02:12:53,620 --> 02:12:56,020
So maybe perhaps I fought back.

1327
02:12:56,500 --> 02:12:58,900
- But it was only to defend myself.
- So your memory's coming back.

1328
02:12:59,380 --> 02:13:00,820
- Yes.
- Good.

1329
02:13:01,300 --> 02:13:04,660
Now, you tell me why God let all those
battles happen in the first place.

1330
02:13:05,140 --> 02:13:06,580
He's so powerful. You said...

1331
02:13:07,060 --> 02:13:08,500
'' He's the creator of heaven and Earth,
the source of all life.''

1332
02:13:08,980 --> 02:13:12,340
He could easily have stopped
all that blood and misery.

1333
02:13:12,820 --> 02:13:13,300
Why didn't He--

1334
02:13:13,780 --> 02:13:16,180
Is He the one who spread
all that blood and misery?

1335
02:13:16,620 --> 02:13:18,060
- Is He?
- No. But He could have stopped it.

1336
02:13:18,540 --> 02:13:20,940
What, did he get pleasure--
pleasure--

1337
02:13:21,420 --> 02:13:24,780
pleasure from watching us killing
each other in His name?

1338
02:13:25,260 --> 02:13:26,700
In His name?

1339
02:13:27,180 --> 02:13:30,540
In His name. We fought and killed
in His name--

1340
02:13:31,020 --> 02:13:32,460
- the King of Heaven.
- Really?

1341
02:13:32,940 --> 02:13:34,380
Let all those who love me
follow me!

1342
02:13:35,820 --> 02:13:37,260
'' Let all who love me
follow me!''

1343
02:13:37,740 --> 02:13:40,140
Where does God get mentioned?

1344
02:13:40,620 --> 02:13:42,060
Come on, Jeanne.

1345
02:13:42,540 --> 02:13:43,980
Be honest.

1346
02:13:44,460 --> 02:13:46,860
You fought for yourself.
In your name.

1347
02:13:47,340 --> 02:13:48,780
No!

1348
02:13:49,260 --> 02:13:51,660
I was defending myself
as best as I could.

1349
02:13:52,140 --> 02:13:53,580
Everyone has the right
to defend themselves, don't they?

1350
02:13:55,020 --> 02:13:56,460
Yes, they do!
Should I have let myself get killed?

1351
02:13:56,900 --> 02:13:58,340
- Is that it?
- No. You did fine.

1352
02:13:58,820 --> 02:14:00,260
I'd even say well done.

1353
02:14:00,740 --> 02:14:02,180
As a matter of fact...

1354
02:14:02,660 --> 02:14:05,060
most of the ones you killed
probably deserved it, don't you think?

1355
02:14:09,380 --> 02:14:11,780
I never thought killing each other
would bring about any peace.

1356
02:14:12,260 --> 02:14:12,740
I agree.

1357
02:14:13,220 --> 02:14:14,660
Peace will only be got from
the English at the end of a lance.

1358
02:14:15,140 --> 02:14:17,540
I don't agree. Why do you keep
changing your mind all the time?

1359
02:14:19,940 --> 02:14:21,380
You. Why--

1360
02:14:21,860 --> 02:14:24,260
Why are you doing this to me?

1361
02:14:24,740 --> 02:14:26,180
Do you get pleasure from hurting me?

1362
02:14:26,660 --> 02:14:30,020
Pleasure.
That's a difficult word to define.

1363
02:14:32,420 --> 02:14:35,780
When does pain end and pleasure begin?
When did your pleasure begin?

1364
02:14:36,260 --> 02:14:39,580
With that sword in your hand?

1365
02:14:41,980 --> 02:14:44,380
I never took pleasure...

1366
02:14:44,860 --> 02:14:46,300
in hurting anyone.

1367
02:14:47,740 --> 02:14:49,180
Really?

1368
02:15:13,660 --> 02:15:16,980
Set me free. Set me free.

1369
02:15:17,460 --> 02:15:17,940
You will be, Jeanne.

1370
02:15:20,340 --> 02:15:21,780
You will be.

1371
02:15:42,420 --> 02:15:43,860
Jeanne, my very dear
friend in Christ...

1372
02:15:44,340 --> 02:15:45,780
we, your judges and assessors...

1373
02:15:46,260 --> 02:15:48,660
desirous of reaching
a true and lawful verdict...

1374
02:15:49,140 --> 02:15:51,540
submitted a transcript of your trial
to the University of Paris...

1375
02:15:52,020 --> 02:15:53,460
to attain their opinion.

1376
02:15:53,940 --> 02:15:55,380
After careful consideration...

1377
02:15:55,860 --> 02:15:57,260
the learned scholars
have concluded with us...

1378
02:15:57,740 --> 02:16:01,100
that you have committed
many grievous sins.

1379
02:16:01,580 --> 02:16:03,980
I ask you now
to listen most carefully...

1380
02:16:04,460 --> 02:16:06,860
to their opinion,
as detailed in these articles.

1381
02:16:10,220 --> 02:16:10,700
Article One.

1382
02:16:11,180 --> 02:16:14,540
You said that by God's command you have
continually worn men's clothes...

1383
02:16:15,020 --> 02:16:17,420
and that you have also worn
your hair short...

1384
02:16:17,900 --> 02:16:20,300
with nothing to distinguish you from
the soldiers with whom you fought.

1385
02:16:24,620 --> 02:16:26,060
Don't abandon me. Please.

1386
02:16:28,460 --> 02:16:31,820
Where are You?

1387
02:16:32,300 --> 02:16:33,740
Where are You? Please.

1388
02:16:38,020 --> 02:16:40,420
Is this what You want?

1389
02:16:41,860 --> 02:16:44,260
You want me to...

1390
02:16:44,740 --> 02:16:47,140
to burn...

1391
02:16:47,620 --> 02:16:49,060
without...

1392
02:16:49,540 --> 02:16:50,980
being confessed?

1393
02:16:51,460 --> 02:16:53,860
Finally, Article 12.

1394
02:16:54,340 --> 02:16:56,740
You have said that you are not
willing to submit yourself...

1395
02:16:57,220 --> 02:16:59,620
to the judgment of the church militant,
but only to God.

1396
02:17:01,060 --> 02:17:01,540
As to this article,
the scholars say...

1397
02:17:02,980 --> 02:17:04,420
that you have no comprehension
of the authority of the Church.

1398
02:17:04,900 --> 02:17:07,300
That you have perniciously erred
in the faith of God...

1399
02:17:07,780 --> 02:17:11,140
and you are a child of superstition,
a wanderer from the faith...

1400
02:17:11,620 --> 02:17:14,980
an invoker of demons, an idolater...

1401
02:17:15,460 --> 02:17:16,860
and a heretic.

1402
02:17:27,900 --> 02:17:30,300
We once again admonish,
beg and exalt you...

1403
02:17:30,780 --> 02:17:34,140
to cast out and recant
your erroneous beliefs...

1404
02:17:34,620 --> 02:17:37,020
by signing this recantation.

1405
02:17:38,460 --> 02:17:38,940
Please.

1406
02:17:41,340 --> 02:17:42,780
If the Church...

1407
02:17:43,260 --> 02:17:45,660
wants me to say...

1408
02:17:46,140 --> 02:17:48,540
that my visions are evil...

1409
02:17:49,020 --> 02:17:51,420
then I do not believe in this Church.

1410
02:17:56,660 --> 02:17:57,140
Perform your office.

1411
02:18:03,380 --> 02:18:04,820
Wait.

1412
02:18:09,140 --> 02:18:11,540
Jeanne, I beg of you, sign.

1413
02:18:12,020 --> 02:18:14,420
In God's name, don't you understand?
I'm trying to save you.

1414
02:18:14,900 --> 02:18:17,300
I want to be confessed.

1415
02:18:18,740 --> 02:18:20,180
Sign this and I will confess you
myself, if you want.

1416
02:18:21,620 --> 02:18:24,980
And may I--

1417
02:18:25,460 --> 02:18:27,860
May I go to Mass?

1418
02:18:28,340 --> 02:18:29,780
As often as you like.

1419
02:18:30,260 --> 02:18:32,660
Now, for the love of God, sign.

1420
02:18:37,900 --> 02:18:41,260
Sign, Jeanne,
and you'll be free of your chains.

1421
02:18:41,740 --> 02:18:43,180
Free of the fire, Jeanne.

1422
02:19:17,220 --> 02:19:18,660
Thank you.

1423
02:19:22,020 --> 02:19:24,420
Do you know what you just signed?

1424
02:19:25,860 --> 02:19:27,300
You just signed away His existence.

1425
02:19:29,700 --> 02:19:33,060
- I didn't mean to.
- For you, He's a lie.

1426
02:19:35,460 --> 02:19:36,900
An illusion.

1427
02:19:37,380 --> 02:19:38,820
No, no.

1428
02:19:39,300 --> 02:19:40,740
He told me that I would be confessed.

1429
02:19:42,180 --> 02:19:44,580
In the end, it was you
who abandoned Him.

1430
02:19:51,780 --> 02:19:54,180
- May I have that back, please?
- You have nothing to regret.

1431
02:19:56,540 --> 02:19:58,940
Give it back to me!

1432
02:19:59,420 --> 02:20:01,820
- Give it back!
- Take her away!

1433
02:20:07,100 --> 02:20:08,540
Silence her!

1434
02:20:12,860 --> 02:20:15,260
There. She has recanted.

1435
02:20:15,740 --> 02:20:17,180
And we accept her repentance...

1436
02:20:17,660 --> 02:20:21,020
for the Church never closes her arms
to those who would return to the fold.

1437
02:20:22,460 --> 02:20:25,820
Now she's your martyr, not ours.

1438
02:20:52,180 --> 02:20:53,620
Please!

1439
02:20:59,860 --> 02:21:01,300
Enough.

1440
02:21:07,540 --> 02:21:09,940
Here.

1441
02:21:10,420 --> 02:21:12,820
If you want to get dressed,
try these for size.

1442
02:21:19,980 --> 02:21:21,420
My lord bishop.

1443
02:21:31,500 --> 02:21:32,940
Come to see for yourself.

1444
02:21:33,420 --> 02:21:34,860
Well, take a look.

1445
02:21:40,140 --> 02:21:42,540
You see?
Dressed as a man again.

1446
02:21:43,020 --> 02:21:44,460
Her touching repentance
didn't last very long, did it?

1447
02:21:46,860 --> 02:21:51,180
The Bishop of Senlis was passing by
and was on hand to witness her relapse.

1448
02:21:53,580 --> 02:21:55,980
And by what miracle did these clothes
find their way in here?

1449
02:21:56,420 --> 02:21:57,860
Not a miracle, my dear Cauchon.

1450
02:21:58,340 --> 02:22:00,740
An evil spell.

1451
02:22:01,220 --> 02:22:03,620
This girl is a witch,
and tomorrow she will burn for it.

1452
02:22:06,020 --> 02:22:08,420
Have the stake prepared
in the market place.

1453
02:22:23,300 --> 02:22:26,660
Jeanne, I don't understand.
Why did you do it?

1454
02:22:27,140 --> 02:22:28,580
- Why?
- And you.

1455
02:22:29,060 --> 02:22:30,500
Why did you lie?

1456
02:22:30,980 --> 02:22:32,420
You promised to have me confessed.

1457
02:22:32,900 --> 02:22:35,300
I know. It was the only way
to have you saved from the fire.

1458
02:22:35,780 --> 02:22:38,140
It's not my body I want to save.

1459
02:22:38,620 --> 02:22:40,060
It's my soul.

1460
02:22:41,500 --> 02:22:43,900
I ask only one thing.

1461
02:22:44,380 --> 02:22:47,740
Please, hear my confession.

1462
02:22:52,060 --> 02:22:54,460
I can't, Jeanne.
I can't hear your confession.

1463
02:22:58,780 --> 02:23:00,220
I'm very sorry.

1464
02:23:20,820 --> 02:23:22,260
You want to confess?

1465
02:23:26,580 --> 02:23:28,020
I'm listening.

1466
02:23:28,500 --> 02:23:30,900
I've committed sins, my Lord.

1467
02:23:34,260 --> 02:23:35,700
So many sins.

1468
02:23:39,060 --> 02:23:42,420
I saw so many signs.

1469
02:23:42,900 --> 02:23:44,340
Many signs.

1470
02:23:46,740 --> 02:23:48,180
The ones I wanted to see.

1471
02:23:54,420 --> 02:23:56,780
I fought...

1472
02:24:00,140 --> 02:24:01,580
out of revenge...

1473
02:24:04,940 --> 02:24:06,380
and despair.

1474
02:24:13,580 --> 02:24:15,980
I was all the things...

1475
02:24:16,460 --> 02:24:19,820
that people believe...

1476
02:24:20,300 --> 02:24:21,740
they're allowed to be...

1477
02:24:22,220 --> 02:24:24,620
when they're fighting for...

1478
02:24:28,940 --> 02:24:29,420
a cause.

1479
02:24:30,860 --> 02:24:32,300
For a cause.

1480
02:24:34,700 --> 02:24:36,100
I was...

1481
02:24:38,500 --> 02:24:39,940
proud...

1482
02:24:41,380 --> 02:24:42,820
and...

1483
02:24:46,180 --> 02:24:46,660
stubborn.

1484
02:24:48,100 --> 02:24:48,580
Selfish.

1485
02:24:50,020 --> 02:24:51,460
Selfish.

1486
02:24:51,940 --> 02:24:54,340
Yes. Cruel.

1487
02:24:57,700 --> 02:24:59,140
Yes.

1488
02:24:59,620 --> 02:25:01,060
Cruel.

1489
02:25:03,460 --> 02:25:04,900
You think you are ready now?

1490
02:25:10,180 --> 02:25:10,660
Yes.

1491
02:25:13,060 --> 02:25:14,500
Good.
