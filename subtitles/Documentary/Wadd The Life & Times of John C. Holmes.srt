00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:09,320
Say hello to her, *Hyung.

3
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:09,320
[Hyung: Older brother or older male]

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,070
Miss Lee Bom Yi is…

5
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,340
…my girlfriend.

6
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:44,670
What do you mean?

7
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:47,160
Your girlfriend is…

8
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,180
…the daughter of your
hospital’s director?

9
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,120
That’s right.

10
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:56,330
Unni, aren’t you a dietitian?

11
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:56,330
[Unni: Older sister or older female]

12
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,190
Yes, that’s right, too.

13
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,190
I’m sorry that I couldn’t 
tell you earlier.

14
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,010
We're becoming family...

15
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,360
...but my first impression wasn't great.

16
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,140
I wanted to tell you after I made
it up to you…

17
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,740
…by pulling that posting.

18
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,770
It isn’t your fault.
You don’t need to apologize for that.

19
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,730
I was involved too.

20
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,460
I'm sorry if it hurt your feelings.

21
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,970
No, it’s okay.

22
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,900
There’s nothing I have
to feel bad about.

23
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:25,750
I’m… just a little surprised.

24
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,290
I’m sorry.

25
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,470
No, it’s okay.
It’s really okay.

26
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,300
Oh my.

27
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,260
What should I do?

28
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:37,230
Excuse me for a moment.

29
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,460
It's ok.

30
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,740
Just a moment.

31
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,810
Long time no see, little miss.

32
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,220
Aren't you going to say hello
to your uncle?

33
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,350
Hello.

34
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:00,930
See?

35
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,480
We’ll see each other often.

36
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,910
By the way,
how did you know I was here?

37
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,910
Oh, I told you that you
were easy to read.

38
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:15,750
Huh?

39
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,150
If I go somewhere that smells like good
food, you're always there.

40
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,300
I’m going to find my dad.

41
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,520
Your brother doesn’t seem to like me.

42
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,990
That’s not true.
He likes you.

43
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,920
How do you know that?

44
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,820
I’m his brother.
Of course I can tell...

45
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,820
…by seeing his eyes and expression.

46
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:15,730
Poo Reum.

47
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,670
Why are you here?

48
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,510
Why are you crying, honey?

49
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,120
Huh?

50
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,330
I don’t know why…

51
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,650
…I’m crying.

52
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,480
I don’t know either.

53
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,560
I think your dad knows.

54
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,150
How do you know?

55
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,200
You were hanging out
with Unni like this...

56
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,770
…and you liked it…

57
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,860
…so you want me and Unni...

58
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,100
...to keep seeing each other.

59
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,040
Days like today...

60
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,010
...you should just enjoy and forget.

61
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,740
If you keep wishing for it to happen...

62
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,720
...you're being greedy.

63
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,260
Then...

64
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:15,100
...do you want it too, dad?

65
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,660
No.

66
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,390
Today was enough for me.

67
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:24,910
You’re lying.

68
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,480
Wipe your tears now.

69
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,660
If your uncle sees you crying,
he'll feel bad.

70
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,580
Right?

71
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,430
Stand up.

72
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,410
Let’s go.

73
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,080
Hey, why don’t you carry those?

74
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,510
It’s okay.
I can carry them.

75
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,320
This…

76
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,140
Hold on to it for me.

77
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,470
Did you buy this?

78
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,210
It was a free gift.

79
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,520
She threatened me and stole if from me.

80
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,210
Well.

81
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,580
This is yours…

82
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,710
…and this is Ba Da’s.

83
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,440
Could you give it to him?

84
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,100
Thank you.

85
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:46,160
Don’t be too concerned.

86
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,140
This is yours.

87
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:57,800
This is for the children’s
maternal grandmother…

88
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,220
…and this is for your mother.

89
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,860
This is a lot.

90
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,640
Why did you buy so much?

91
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,790
It isn’t much.

92
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,540
I hope that you like it.

93
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,380
Ah, the hat!

94
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,820
What should I do with the hat?
It’s in my car.

95
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,140
What hat?

96
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,440
Well.

97
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:19,830
I bought one to give
your girlfriend tomorrow.

98
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,430
Just give it to me tomorrow.

99
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,560
We'll see each other then anyway.

100
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,530
We already met today.

101
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,250
Do we have to meet again tomorrow?

102
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,610
You're right.

103
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:36,230
I need some time
to comfort Poo Reum too.

104
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,000
Still, let’s meet tomorrow.

105
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,180
I didn't get to see Ba Da...

106
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,940
...and I need to meet your mother too.

107
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,090
Ah, actually…

108
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:44,820
…my mother called and said
she can't come tomorrow.

109
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,960
Excuse me?

110
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,460
Your mother and my mother met already…

111
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,750
…so she said she doesn’t need
to see you tomorrow.

112
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:54,320
She already... met my mother?

113
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,500
You didn’t know either?

114
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,350
No.

115
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,520
Did my mother...

116
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,560
...say something to her?

117
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,240
I heard that your mother
didn’t say much.

118
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:10,490
I’ll send the hat through Dong Wook.

119
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,770
Bye.

120
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:12,990
Okay.

121
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,850
- Bye.
- Bye.

122
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:18,120
Take care.

123
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,700
Come here.

124
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,460
I’m out.
Let’s talk later.

125
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,020
<i>What did you tell her?</i>

126
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,030
You asked his brother to meet a woman?

127
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,580
What do you mean?

128
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,650
Why so suddenly?

129
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:45,770
I’m busy.

130
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,630
Let’s talk at home. 
Bye.

131
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,520
You heard me, right?

132
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,050
My mother's being crazy.

133
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,810
Calm down.

134
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,820
I can understand her.

135
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,730
How could you take her side on this?

136
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,340
I’m not on her side.

137
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,920
It’d just be good for him
to meet a woman.

138
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,270
We're not talking about whether or not
that would be good for him.

139
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,100
How could she suddenly visit
my mother-in-law...

140
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,620
…and ask your brother to meet someone?

141
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,100
How did that sound to your mother?

142
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,700
It's none of my mother's business
if your brother is single.

143
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,770
I remember when
I first saw you, Miss Bae.

144
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,350
The first time I came
in the hospital entrance...

145
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:38,640
...you were the first person I saw.

146
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,890
You always smiled at me…

147
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:43,640
…so you made quite 
an impression on me.

148
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,820
I didn't see you for a while...

149
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,300
…and you appeared again
with Chairman Song…

150
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,110
…so I was very surprised.

151
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,490
Were you?

152
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,580
Learning the business from me
is only an excuse.

153
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,610
I know that your real 
job is to report…

154
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:06,610
…what’s going on in the hospital
to Chairman Song.

155
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:10,380
I know that you’re aware of it.

156
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,410
About Dr. Kang Dong Wook…

157
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,550
Yes?

158
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,060
I’d like...

159
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,100
...you to meet his older brother.

160
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,250
What will happen to me...

161
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:48,740
...if I reject your request?

162
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,010
Yes.

163
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:53,980
Yes.

164
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,770
Yes, okay.

165
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,040
I’ll tell him that.

166
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,280
By the way...

167
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,490
...don’t visit me or call me
from now on.

168
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:03,790
Don’t misunderstand.

169
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm just busy during the day.

170
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:09,290
Yes, if you need to tell me something...

171
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:10,790
…send me a text message.

172
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,150
Okay.

173
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:23,380
Why did you meet Dr. Kang’s mother
without discussing it with me?

174
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,150
Huh?

175
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,430
How dare you visit her so casually?

176
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,420
I’m still talking.
Where are you going?

177
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,530
Where…

178
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,230
Why are you running away from me?

179
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,700
Running away from you?
You sound very impolite.

180

Honey, Bom Yi...
Let's stop.

181
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:40,170
Tell me everything you talked about
with Dr. Kang's mother.

182
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:44,730
I said I know a woman who would be
a good marriage partner...

183
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:47,160
…and I found out that Dr. Kang’s brother
is a single man.

184
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,680
Why don’t we let the two of them meet?

185
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,370
I suggested it nicely like that.

186
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,830
Are we done now?

187
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,810
Dad, do you believe her?

188
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:02,060
Yes, I do.
I always believe your mother.

189

Don’t behave so rudely.

191

If you really care about manners,
how could you do that?

192
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,950
What did I do so wrong?

193
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,320
You don’t know what you did wrong?

194
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,750
You told her directly that you don’t like
the children without their mother.

195
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,770
You're just making things worse!
They're already hurt.

196

My daughter's health is at risk
because of someone else's children.

197
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,070
I had to do it because I was so worried.

198
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,470
They aren’t just
someone else’s children.

199
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,870
They'll be my family too.

200
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,920
I can handle it just fine
without damaging my health.

201
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,940
I had to do it because you're like this.

202
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,320
Why do you only care about others?
Why can’t you care about me?

203
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,180
I know your child is important to you...

204
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,090
...but you still shouldn't hurt other's
children for your own child's sake.

205
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:41,520
How dare you lecture me?

I’m doing this all for your sake.

I texted you.
You should just text me back.

214

Why did you call me instead?

215
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,100
Are you mad at me, mother?

216
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,920
Did you text me because you didn't
want to hear my voice?

217
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,040
Don’t misunderstand me.

218
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,430
I sent you the text because I was
afraid calling would wake you up.

Why would I go there?

for the Organ Transplant Center…

330
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,950
…the director wants.

331
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,140
We need to get out of a deficit first...

332
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,680
…and then we’ll grow the hospital.

333
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,670
Okay?

334
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:58,200
As soon as the hospital’s
financial condition is recovered…

335
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,640
…we’ll reopen
the Organ Transplant Center.

336
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,040
If you write that clause
into my contract...

337
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,540
...I'll renew it.

338
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:14,250
Miss Bae.

339
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,440
Add the clause about reopening
the Organ Transplant Center…

340
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,700
…to his contract.

341
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,750
Of course.

342
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,950
You’re the only one for me.

343
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:24,820
Same here.

344
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,890
That's right.

345
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,120
You must be happy…

346
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,010
...to have such a thoughtful man
as your son-in-law.

347
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:32,460
Did you hear us?
You're jealous, right?

348
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,050
Yes, I am.

349
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,680
You may hear from Bom Yi about it...

350
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,930
…but I met your mother, Dr. Kang.

351
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,340
Yes, I heard.

352
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:46,100
You’re close with Miss Bae…

353
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:49,640
...so you wouldn't be opposed
to having her as family, right?

354
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:54,040
I think your mother would be
satisfied with her too.

355
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:55,870
- Excuse me?
- Wait a moment.

356
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:59,490
The woman you're introducing
to Dr. Kang's brother...

357
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,420
…is Miss Bae?

358
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,260
Let go of me.

359
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,460
People are watching.

360
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,650
I don’t care.

361
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,070
What’s wrong with you?
What's with this reaction?

362
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,100
Did you break up with Chairman Song?

363
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,900
Why do you care whether or not
I broke up with him?

364
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,000
I don't really care whether
you did or not.

365
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,470
What I care about...

366
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,970
...is you meeting my brother.

367
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:24,670
Why do you care about that?

368
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:26,170
You had a relationship 
with an older man...

369
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:28,100
…and the whole hospital 
knows about it.

370
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,670
Of course I'd hate the idea of you
being with my brother.

371
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,520
I have no choice.

372
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,380
This is the best I can do.

373
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,300
The best you can do?

374
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,790
Do you think that it was easy
to get where I am from being a clerk?

375
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,860
I can’t give up now.

376
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,600
I’ll do what they ask me to do.

377
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,730
I'm warning you.

378
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,910
Don’t meet my brother.

379
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,800
You don’t deserve my brother.

380
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,860
You asked me to keep it a secret
from Miss Lee Bom Yi...

381
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:57,010
...that we lived together,
for old time's sake.

382
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,840
I'll do this favor for you...

383
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,680
...but you shouldn't disturb me either.

384
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:15,150
Okay, I’ll see you then.

385
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:16,450
Bye.

386
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,340
I hurried here.

387
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,090
Were you waiting for me?

388
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,050
You surprised me.

389
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:39,790
I thought you’d be mad at me
because of my mother…

390
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,460
Excuse me?

391
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,700
Don’t do this.

392
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,630
You sent me a text and asked
me to come here.

393
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,210
I sent you a text message?

394
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,230
I was curious…

395
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,670
…why you were acting so cool.

396
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,780
Excuse me, Miss Lee Bom Yi.

397
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:56,400
I think you misunderstood me again…

398
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,820
I think this is good.

399
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,680
I wanted to take care of this anyway…

400
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,530
...and you've given me the chance...

401
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:04,780
…so I’d like to apologize to you.

402
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:08,250
[Bom-patenette]

403
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:08,250
[I’m sorry for asking you to come
even though I promised...]

404
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,930
I’m really sorry.

405
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,770
I think...

406
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:16,720
...my mother did it for my sake.

407
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,530
I'll get on my knees to apologize
if that'll help.

408
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,200
I really hope that you'll accept
my apology for this.

409
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,400
Hold on a minute.

410
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,750
It was you, right?

411
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,820
You sent her the message, right?

412
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,740
Of course.

413
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,180
You're really grateful, huh?

414
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:40,090
I’m like a love messenger.

415
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,960
What is this emoticon?

416
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:46,440
How did you know my password?

417
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,590
I knew that it'd be simple.

418
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,740
I’ll see you later.

419
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,810
Keep your promise with her.

420
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:56,820
Go now.

421
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,910
Anyway...

422
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:08,580
...it’s lucky that I have a chance
to apologize to you like this.

423
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,920
Actually, I was sick…

424
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,930
…but I’m better now.

425
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:16,230
Okay, Miss Lee Bom Yi…

426
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:19,330
My mother did it for my sake...

427
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:20,990
…so please forgive her.

428
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:22,590
I’ll be really nice to you.

429
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,430
Okay.
I get it, so...

430
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,760
You know…

431
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,900
...I already know you don't like me.

432
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:32,720
You dislike me, don't you?

433
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,240
No way.

434
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,540
Why would I dislike you?

435
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:43,810
If I disliked you,
I wouldn't visit you...

436
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:45,980
...or go shopping and have
a meal with you.

437
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,080
I like you, Miss Lee Bom Yi.

438
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,090
Really?

439
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,880
I even messaged you.

440
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,200
I did, but…

441
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,990
…I think I just forgot
 because I’m old.

442
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,430
See?

443
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:05,610
I’m sorry.

444
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:07,870
- This is the contract.
- Okay.

445
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:11,930
Let’s go see the ranch.

446
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:14,410
You should've just said that
to start with.

447
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:16,150
Just wait here a minute.

448
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:18,530
The sun is hot, so 
I’ll get you the hat.

449
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:19,560
Hold on a second.

450
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,020
Wow!
This is so wonderful.

451
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,060
Is this all yours, father?

452
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,530
Yes, you could say that.

453
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:37,810
Wow, you're really great...

454
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:38,990
...brother.

455
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,980
Now you've called me brother
and father.

456
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,610
Just call me whatever you want.

457
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,850
By the way...

458
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:50,110
...how much older
than Dong Wook are you?

459
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,950
Ten... Ten years.

460
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,210
Ten years?

461
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:55,770
Then the difference between us...

462
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:57,930
…is eighteen years!

463
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:01,020
That’s why you shouldn’t talk back
to your elders like that.

464
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:01,990
Okay.

465
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:05,440
Dong Wook's quite a bit
older than you too.

466
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,310
Yeah.

467
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,970
That's why he treats me
like a kid sometimes.

468
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,970
He’s funny.

469
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:13,660
He hates it so much when I 
treat him like a kid.

470
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,990
That’s right.

471
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,600
Sometimes he’s more cheesy
and childish than me though.

472
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,080
It’s because he was a late child
and he's the youngest.

473
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,670
It's nice to talk about him
behind his back with you.

474
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:24,460
His ears must be tingling, huh?

475
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,540
Thank you.

476
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,190
What?

477
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:39,760
Nevermind.

478
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:42,130
I was just hearing things.

479
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:43,630
Oh I see.

480
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,320
Hold it tightly.

481
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,200
No, I mean…

482
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,590
<i>You’re doing it so well.</i>

483
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,450
Can I make cheese here?

484
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,330
I like cheese a lot.

485
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:37,010
Yeah, sure.
Let’s go.

486
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,720
More?

487
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:23,960
- No thank you.
- Try it please.

488
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,020
- I made it, so…
- I said I’m okay.

489
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,340
Here...

490
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,620
You did it intentionally, right?

491
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:44,450
I told you that I had a reason.

492
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,040
Why?

493
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,340
What kind of a reason?

494
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,210
Tell me.

495
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:53,770
Let's hear it.

496
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:57,380
That’s…

497
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,960
I had a daydream
about something like it.

498
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,510
Daydream?

499
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,530
Well, it wasn't really me.

500
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:09,290
Someone else asked me to do it.

501
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,860
What kind of daydream?

502
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,720
What did you imagine?

503
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,780
That’s…

504
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,460
Nevermind.

505
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,670
Let’s just say that
I did it intentionally.

506
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,040
Then...

507
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:30,040
...we'll say this terror offsets
my mother's mistake.

508
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,780
- Terror?
- Yes, it is.

509
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,020
It's milk terror.

510
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,190
Okay.

511
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:39,430
Offset it or whatever.

512
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,580
Then I'll change clothes here.

513
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:48,080
Thank God you have a change of clothes.

514
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,530
I know, right?

515
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:54,210
After I fell into the sea on Udo Island
because of someone...

516
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:57,370
...I always bring
extra clothes with me...

517
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:59,910
…because I don’t know when
it'll happen to me again.

518
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,390
Bye then.

519
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,810
Hey, that lady...

520
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:13,740
Isn't she the one I met on Udo Island?

521
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,180
So what?

522
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,120
Why is she here?

523
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,020
Where’s mother?

524
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:21,060
She isn’t back yet?

525
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:24,050
She left earlier than me
in a separate car from Kimpo Ranch.

526
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:25,620
Don’t change the subject.

527
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:27,810
Did you meet her again?

528
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:29,530
Are you keeping in touch with her?

529
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:31,400
Don’t get me wrong.

530
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,110
She’s Dong Wook’s girlfriend.

531
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:38,190
Then why Dong Wook’s 
girlfriend is here?

532
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,870
Hello.

533
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,570
Who are you?

534
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:53,940
I haven’t seen you before.

535
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,010
Oh...

536
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:57,530
I’m a visitor here
for our meat supplier.

537
00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:00,630
I got milk on my clothes, so I
was going to change before I left.

538
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:01,800
I see.

539
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,630
Wow, you're still working at your age.

540
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:08,430
You look so nice and healthy.

541
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:09,460
You’re really the best.

542
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:14,980
I want to work as long as you are
and be healthy like you.

543
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:18,080
You sure talk a lot even though
we just met for the first time.

544
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,140
When will you change your clothes?

545
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,770
I’m sorry.

546
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:24,570
I'm so used to talking to my patients.

547
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:25,680
Okay.

548
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,620
- Change now.
- Yes.

549
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:34,220
Oh, this...

550
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:37,240
Oh my God.
Were you seriously sick?

551
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,260
I had a heart disease.

552
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,370
This is just a scar left
from heart surgery.

553
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,550
You’re so young.
How could you...

554
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,460
I’m okay now.

555
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,500
Take care, grandmother.

556
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,610
Okay.

557
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:53,430
Thank you for being concerned
about my health.

558
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:12,230
I liked her a lot.

559
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,280
Why does she have to be
Dong Wook’s girlfriend?

560
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:20,220
Such a good woman
is Dong Wook’s partner...

561
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,900
It's fortunate, isn't it?

562
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,810
You really aren't disappointed at all?

563
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:28,050
I’m not.

564
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,810
You know…

565
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:35,750
...you never went near the sea
after your wife died...

566
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:39,650
...but you jumped right in to save her
on the anniversary of your wife's death.

567
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:42,730
I just thought...

568
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:45,730
...it was fate.

569
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:08,260
Jesus Christ.

570
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:11,000
Jeez, why...

571
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:14,010
Were you drinking again?

572
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,910
I brought you water.

573
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:26,300
Look at you.

574
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,370
Uncle's getting married soon...

575
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:30,410
...and you're drinking
like this every day.

576
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:35,060
How are those related?

577
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:39,000
Who would like you as a man
when you're like this?

578
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,830
I don’t need anyone else to like me…

579
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:44,750
…as long as both of you like me.

580
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,060
- Stop it.
- Come here.

581
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:53,720
Hey, you.

582
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,890
I'm meeting a woman soon.

583
00:35:57,310 --> 00:36:00,960
If you say stuff like that,
I'll lose my confidence.

584
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,500
It’s really over.

585
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,610
Huh?

586
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:08,150
Unni...

587
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:12,000
I didn't really realize she was
getting married to uncle...

588
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:16,600
...but if you meet another woman,
then it's really all over.

589
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:22,020
Are you finally awake from your dream?

590
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,440
My dream?

591
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,520
Your dream of me being
in a relationship with her.

592
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:34,230
It’s only a dream...

593
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,190
...a dream which will be nothing
when I wake up.

594
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:40,920
Dreams are the opposite of reality.

595
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:42,660
That’s right.

596
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,580
You’re so right.

597
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:49,270
What a smart boy.

598
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:53,000
Who did you get all those brains from?

599
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,070
Isn’t this the place?

600
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:21,250
[Oppa: Older brother or older male]

601
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:21,250
Where are you, *Oppa?

602
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:22,470
The movie will start soon.

603
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:24,770
<i>The traffic is really bad here, so...</i>

604
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:25,810
What should we do?

605
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,290
<i>Would you like to go in first?</i>

606
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:28,450
Okay.

607
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:30,580
By the way, this place is strange.
No one else is here.

608
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,750
<i>Ah.</i>

609
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,190
<i>That's because it's not
a regular theater.</i>

610
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,180
<i>I’ll be there soon.</i>

611
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,280
<i>Wait for me a little longer.</i>

612
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,660
Okay.

613
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,850
Come quickly and drive safely.

614
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:45,370
I'm scared.

615
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:11,760
God, you're unbelievable.

616
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:21,290
[It’s a miracle that 
I could meet you.]

617
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:25,390
[You make my heart flutter...]

618
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,300
[…and I learned what real love is
after meeting you.]

619
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:40,810
[My time with you is like a dream,
not reality.]

620
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:49,520
[What's obvious to me is how
I smile when I'm with you.]

621
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,690
[Will you marry me?]

622
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,180
Yes, what is it?

623
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:26,630
Blood pressure?

624
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:31,340
Take a CT and if you confirm
an aortic rupture…

625
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,700
…start surgery right away.

626
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:36,600
Call Dr. Choi and the director
as soon as possible.

627
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,560
<i>I’m afraid that I can’t do it.</i>

628
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:39,650
Why not?

629
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:41,530
Dr. Choi is in surgery now...

630
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:44,000
…and the patient doesn’t want
the director to perform his operation.

631
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,020
He said he'd rather change hospitals.

632
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,830
Okay, I'm coming back now.

633
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,290
Who are you?

634
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:03,300
I’m sorry.

635
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:07,150
Your boyfriend left urgently
for an emergency operation.

636
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,380
Oh, is that right?

637
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:13,170
He said he won't be coming back.

638
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:16,120
He probably wouldn't.

639
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:18,610
However...

640
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:22,030
...what would you like me to do
for the meal he ordered?

641
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,260
<i>By the way, you put in too much sugar.</i>

642
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,580
<i>It’s not good for your health.</i>

643
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:42,510
Your look very different from Dr. Kang.

644
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,780
Do I?

645
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:52,600
Actually, I didn’t want to come here.

646
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:55,540
Why did you come out
if you didn't want to?

647
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:58,830
You wouldn’t understand
since you're a CEO.

648
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:01,620
Some people just have to do
what they're asked.

649
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:07,060
Don’t get me wrong.

650
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:10,850
It's not a matter of whether
I like you or not.

651
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,940
It’s because I’m not willing
to get married.

652
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:17,670
Okay.

653
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:19,920
Even though I didn’t intend for it...

654
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,370
…I’m sorry that I put you
in such an uncomfortable situation.

655
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:24,820
Your boss suggested this meeting to me.

656
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,310
I wasn't aware of your situation.

657
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:30,440
Even if I turn you down…

658
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,040
…Ms. Chairman will...

659
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:35,170
...keep arranging meetings for you
with other women.

660
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:37,330
So...

661
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,010
...can I suggest something?

662
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,460
Why don’t we tell her
that we meet today…

663
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:49,460
...and we like each other so we've
decided to keep seeing each other?

664
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:54,520
Then we can avoid having this kind
 of uncomfortable situation again.

665
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:00,070
Let’s do that.

666
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,910
Thank you.

667
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:05,920
Then I'd like to leave now.

668
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:07,710
Why don’t you…

669
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:11,110
…have a meal with me before you leave?

670
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:16,260
This isn’t a normal date, but…

671
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,660
…I think I should 
still buy you dinner.

672
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,270
What about a drink?

673
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:35,430
By the way, why don't you want
to get married?

674
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:37,700
You sounded very decisive
 when you said it.

675
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:42,250
Since you accepted my suggestion…

676
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:44,260
…I’ll answer you honestly.

677
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:49,490
I loved someone so passionately once…

678
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:53,000
...that I have no regrets left.

679
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,890
I think I gave him all my love then.

680
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:59,000
After I broke up with him,
I've been empty...

681
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:03,400
...and I haven't had feelings since.

682
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,780
That makes me wonder
what kind of man he is.

683
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:12,200
He’s a very nice man.

684
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:19,360
When a man becomes
the best in his field...

685
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:22,350
...he looks great when he works.

686
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:25,340
But compared to him...

687
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,350
...I was just shabby...

688
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:33,420
...so I think I tried too hard...

689
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,930
...to become like him.

690
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:40,820
It doesn't seem like you're
completely over him yet.

691
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:45,300
I should get over him now.

692
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,750
It’s over now.

693
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:51,620
He's getting married soon...

694
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:56,230
…to another woman.

695
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:12,790
Bom Yi!

696
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:13,910
Lee Bom Yi!

697
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:19,700
I’m sorry.

698
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:20,990
I’m really sorry.

699
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:24,020
I’m sorry that I ruined the proposal.

700
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:26,750
What are you talking about?

701
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,980
I think it went just fine.

702
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:30,870
Huh?

703
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:35,040
My answer is yes.

704
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,570
Here, I saved it for you.

705
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:45,560
What is this?

706
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:47,760
You ate enough steak for two people...

707
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,400
...and all you saved me was this
little piece of cake?

708
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,120
The cake was really small.

709
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:53,550
If you don’t want it,
then give it back to me.

710
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:55,200
Be careful!
Eat it carefully!

711
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:59,850
Something might be in the cake.

712
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:02,300
What do you mean?

713
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:04,560
I mean…

714
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,830
…I couldn’t find anything
in the cake I ate.

715
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,560
What are you talking about?

716
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:18,550
Nothing?

717
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,060
Nothing.

718
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,290
Really?

719
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:25,740
I thought…

720
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:28,980
...something would be in there.

721
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:32,710
You can’t wear accessories
 on your hands anyway.

722
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:36,090
Actually, you're right.

723
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:37,590
I can’t wear it anyway…

724
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:39,570
...so there's no point even if
you give me one.

725
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:48,670
So...

726
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:52,290
...are we really going to get married?

727
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:54,260
What?
You haven't realized it?

728
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:57,230
Is it because you got a proposal
without a ring?

729
00:46:57,230 --> 00:46:58,660
That’s not what I meant.

730
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,600
I never thought I'd get married...

731
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,850
...when I was a child.

732
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:04,990
Why not?

733
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,240
Because my father and mother
were always busy…

734
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,840
...and I was really lonely.

735
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:11,860
Is that what married couples are like?

736
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:13,470
If I lived like them,
I wouldn't get married.

737
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:15,000
That’s what I thought.

738
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,930
Then what changed your mind?

739
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:19,480
Hmm...

740
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:22,350
This is an old story.

741
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:25,830
I met a child once, who 
ran away from home.

742
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,830
<i>Hey, why are you crying?</i>

743
00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:53,380
<i>Did you get hurt?</i>

744
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:59,230
<i>It doesn't seem like
you live around here.</i>

745
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:02,590
<i>Did you lose your mom?</i>

746
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,260
<i>You lost your mom?</i>

747
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:12,260
<i>Do you know where you live?</i>

748
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,350
<i>Do you know your phone number?</i>

749
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:16,050
<i>What should I do?</i>

750
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:19,610
<i>You mom and dad must be
very worried.</i>

751
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:23,230
<i>They don’t worry about me.</i>

752
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:25,250
<i>Now...</i>

753
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:29,200
<i>...mom and dad don’t need me anymore.</i>

754
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:31,960
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

755
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,680
<i>You don't think so?</i>

756
00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:37,750
<i>Mom has a new baby.</i>

757
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:41,740
Wow, is that why she ran
away from home?

758
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:42,620
Yes.

759
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:43,850
Anyway…

760
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:47,870
...I could barely calm her down,
but I took her to the police station.

761
00:48:47,870 --> 00:48:50,230
Her parents were there waiting for her.

762
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:55,240
I only ever saw them crying.

763
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:58,490
They just cried together
and hugged each other.

764
00:48:58,490 --> 00:49:00,980
Then they all said, "I love you."
They asked me where she'd been, too.

765
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:02,760
It was quiet a scene...

766
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:06,630
...but...

767
00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:10,060
...it was so beautiful to me.

768
00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:11,880
Was it?

769
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:12,730
Yes.

770
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:17,270
Ah, I want to get married too.

771
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:19,650
I want to have a family like that.

772
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:22,410
That’s what I had in my mind.

773
00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:26,150
Oh!

774
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:29,690
The mother gave me a bracelet
to thank me, too.

775
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:31,180
Where is it?

776
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:33,740
I had it too.

777
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:35,670
Huh?

778
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:37,720
What?
A bracelet?

779
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:38,920
No.

780
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:43,370
I mean a family that was so beautiful...

781
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:46,340
...it made me jealous
and want to get married too.

782
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:48,800
Who were they?

783
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:51,490
My brother’s family...

784
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:55,110
...despite how they ended up.

785
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:06,230
If I got married...

786
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:10,530
...I wanted to live like them.

787
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:15,400
I wanted a son and daughter...

788
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:20,250
...and to live so happily
that others were jealous.

789
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:22,530
I wanted that.

790
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:29,660
That’s the only wish I have.

791
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:38,230
But I couldn't make his wish come true.

792
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:42,900
I had health issues.

793
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:45,900
Is that why you broke up with him?

794
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,840
It was better to simply
break up with him.

795
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:55,400
I lied to him and said
that I had someone else...

796
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:58,270
…because I was afraid I would want
 to get back together with him.

797
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:02,420
Did he believe all that?

798
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:07,140
He believed it, so I’m alone now.

799
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,450
That's so foolish.

800
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,440
You're telling me that?

801
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:23,660
I told you too much of my story.

802
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:29,950
This is the first time I've really
talked about it.

803
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,140
Would you like to have another drink?

804
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:35,030
Yes.

805
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:54,210
You haven't been with anyone
for five years, Mr. CEO?

806
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,350
After my wife died...

807
00:52:01,530 --> 00:52:04,220
...I felt similar to the way you do.

808
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,980
I thought I couldn't love...

809
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:09,810
...someone like that again...

810
00:52:12,490 --> 00:52:14,090
…but maybe...

811
00:52:16,690 --> 00:52:19,760
...that doesn't have to be true.

812
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,530
I've had that thought recently.

813
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:24,970
I met someone...

814
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:28,230
...and my heart fluttered…

815
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:32,820
...so I realized that...

816
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:35,620
...I can do this again.

817
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,160
Then why did you come out to meet me?

818
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,420
Why didn’t you go see her?

819
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:44,160
It's not like that.

820
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:47,820
I thought she was a really good match...

821
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:50,520
...but I found out...

822
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:55,690
...that she's someone I can't
love as a woman.

823
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:12,140
How much longer will it take?

[Hae Gil Hospital]

825
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:14,040
I’ll be out soon.
I’m sorry.

826
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:17,670
Where did I put it?
I kept it here somewhere.

827
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:19,240
Here is it!

828
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:28,670
Long time no see.

829
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:30,240
My lucky charm.

830
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,040
What kind of business do they have…

831
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,430
...that they'd call you at this hour?

832
00:53:54,430 --> 00:53:56,370
We should have another drink.

833
00:53:56,370 --> 00:53:59,000
They said it’s urgent matter,
so I don't have a choice.

834
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:01,130
Then bye for now.

835
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:02,440
Also...

836

...I’ll tell my boss that we’ll
keep seeing each other.

837
00:54:06,370 --> 00:54:07,210
Okay.

838
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:13,570
Oh?

What are you two doing here?

00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:24,280
That’s…

844
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:25,860
We met today.

845
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:29,590
Ah.

846

The woman who was introduced
to Dong Wook's brother...

847
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:34,800
...was you, Miss Bae.

848
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:37,070
Yes.

00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:39,560
Miss Bae.

850
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:41,680
Can I talk to you for a moment?

851
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:45,920
Hyung, can you give Bom Yi a ride?

852
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:49,440
Oh, yeah.

853

I’m okay.

854
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:55,900
Bye.

855

Bye.

856
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:09,940
Did you drink a lot?

857
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:11,010
No.

858
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:13,900
A little.

859
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:17,180
I’ll go home...

860
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:21,510
...and drink the pine needle tea
and Hovenia juice...

...you gave me.

I have something better.

863
00:55:39,090 --> 00:55:41,620
I warned you not to meet my brother.

864
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:44,360
Don’t worry.

865
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:47,070
What you're worried about
won't happen.

866
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:51,520
Regardless of my feelings…

867
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:55,010
…your brother won't like me.

868
00:55:57,570 --> 00:56:01,270
There's already a woman he likes.

869
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:05,810
It seems like a woman you know.

00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:13,130
Tah-dah!

871
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:15,870
Wow.

872
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:20,710
Here.

873
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:24,270
I pureed some tomatoes and carrots.

874
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:25,990
Don't be surprised...

875
00:56:27,110 --> 00:56:28,400
...but I put some honey in too.

876
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:29,830
I put a lot it.

877
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:31,150
You like sweet things.

00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:34,140

You’re welcome.

You aren’t mad at me anymore?

881
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,370
Excuse me?

882
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:44,790
I poured milk on you.

883
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:45,740
Oh.

884
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:49,170
I really didn’t intend to do it.

885
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:52,200
Just don’t pour milk on me again.

886
00:56:57,490 --> 00:56:59,420
Anyway, thank you.

887
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:00,410
For what?

888
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:02,410
Tomatoes and carrots?

889
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:05,360
No?
The honey then?

890
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:09,800
Dong Wook was...

891
00:57:10,830 --> 00:57:13,590
...disappointed in me.

892
00:57:16,330 --> 00:57:18,560
We don’t talk much…

893
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:22,850
…and we’re always awkward
even when we meet...

894
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:26,970
…but when he’s with you…

895
00:57:26,970 --> 00:57:29,950
…he smiles often
and he looks comfortable…

896
00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:32,180
…so I’m happy for him.

897
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:39,580
When I think about you...

898
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:42,120
...there are lots of things
I appreciate you for.

for you and Dong Wook...

901
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:53,080
Your drinking habit
is to thank to others?

902
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:59,100

00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:04,840

to my children...

...even when they were strangers...

905
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:12,740
…and thank you for the seaweed soup
on my birthday.

a book to my children.

908
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:30,940
Actually, they weren't the only ones
happy because of you.

909
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:36,580
I was really grateful too.
