1
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,251
I thought, this is the beginning of the story

2
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:40,365
There is nothing strange,

3
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:44,336
Unlike what I thought,

4
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,372
When you find it, in time

5
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:50,367
In accordance with his orders,

6
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:21,238
Okay, back to me,

7
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:22,503
Come back to me,

8
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:25,477
Come back to me,

9
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:27,539
Gotcha!

10
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,510
Are you the sheriff in this town?

11
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:35,445
With weapons penggelitik me, I will beat you,

12
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,388
No

13
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,324
Do you want me to chase you?

14
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,225
You'd better run,

15
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:02,347
I will remember a time like that,

16
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:07,386
I love you,

17
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:09,443
I hate you,

18
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:23,459
Whether this was the end?

19
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:34,208
Come back to me,

20
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,442
I beg you, come back to me,

21
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:55,367
But now I'm not so sure at the beginning and end.

22
00:03:57,303 --> 00:04:00,329
There is always a barrier to find the story behind your life.

23
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,205
Like the day when we arrived,

24
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,254
Good morning,

25
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:23,353
Where's everybody?

26
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,330
All right, let's get started.

27
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,302
Today we will talk about the Portuguese.

28
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:33,533
y the sound sounds different when compared with other Romance lang

29
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:39,267
The story of the Portuguese, starting from the Kingdom of Galicia,

30
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,439
In the middle ages.

31
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:47,353
Where the language is seen as an expression of ...

32
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:48,411
Art...

33
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:57,293
Is there a story you want to share?

34
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:01,290
Nn. Banks, can you change the TV channel to a news channel?

35
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:21,317
... is already on alert around the scene ...

36
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:28,227
can see, just about to begin, but unfortunately Montana now going on

37
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:33,493
we do know, it landed about 40 minutes ago, having seen the previous

38
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:40,439
is thought the vehicle may be a kind of experiment, or ... wait a minut

39
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:48,380
a report, a similar vehicle turned out to have landed at many locations

40
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,373
Yes, Henry ...

41
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:54,284
This is from a location in Hokkaido,

42
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:58,347
This is a World War, and it starts now.

43
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,524
Well, um ...

44
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,331
We will finish today's lesson.

45
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:02,278
... was filed in cooperation with the authorities to identify the object.

46
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:05,449
It was not ours, we do not even know it was coming from,

47
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:08,483
We're still gathering information, and coordinate with other countries,

48
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:11,520
ou're not the only one who saw this thing in the backyard of your house

49
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:16,233
It has been confirmed this is the first contact,

50
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:18,465
Why send 12? Why not just one?

51
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:46,321
I do not know, ma'am. I'm watching it now as you wish.

52
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:57,471
other, please do not worry, and too believe what other people say to yo

53
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:02,313
Yes, you're right, I was very tense,

54
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,313
Exactly, so ...

55
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,477
I? Yes, you know me.

56
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:10,284
Same as usual

57
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,454
Mom, I'm fine.

58
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:19,355
All right, I'll call you later.

59
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:20,490
See you later.

60
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:31,443
And about eight hours later,

61
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:34,311
the landing, there was still no sign of any kind,

62
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,439
which is referred to as the first contact,

63
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:39,407
The object was about 900 feet high,

64
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:42,444
It was already entering Russian airspace,

65
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:46,289
One in the region, and that only exist in coastal areas ...

66
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:47,314
... landed in the ocean,

67
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,227
So far there are 12 objects that are not known,

68
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:53,528
are scattered throughout the world, logically their location

69
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:57,264
and there is no evidence as to whether these aircraft carrying ...

70
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:00,363
get the idea that this is the type of vehicle

71
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,466
that may not exist in it,

72
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:06,239
Unfortunately, we have limited to matters such as this,

73
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,415
After a bizarre incident last Thursday,

74
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,350
This morning the President will announce the state of emergency,

75
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:23,481
000 existing and security personnel deployed specifically for the state o

76
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:28,291
mand has been issued, and airlines are supposed to carry millions of pa

77
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,491
water, gas, and makana continue to be launched

78
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:36,524
and for a while this country is in an emergency situation law,

79
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:39,370
The IEA has issued a temporary information,

80
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:42,465
which forced a lot of independent suppliers,

81
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,466
to find equipment and weapons

82
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,377
and close their doors to the public.

83
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:52,409
48 hours later, there is information stating that it was a UFO.

84
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:54,477
There is no chance to get the real information

85
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,322
I am of the GT well

86
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,224
I have a family, Mom.

87
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,229
Two years ago at one of the stations in Italy,

88
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:07,494
Perhaps a friend sekerjamu still remember

89
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,491
You could say it like that sergeant,

90
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:14,301
We'll talk,

91
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,332
Everyone needed to translate,

92
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:20,345
That's enough time for two years,

93
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:23,507
during that time we still had a very secret affair

94
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:27,247
Just as in the office, not undermined.

95
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:29,352
Of course!

96
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,298
I want you to translate this for me,

97
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,364
Are you here?

98
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:55,405
Can you stand?

99
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:05,447
Where do you come from?

100
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:15,400
There he is,

101
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:17,491
What do you think,

102
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:24,433
- Is that? - Yes ...

103
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:29,378
- How many? - How much what?

104
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:33,376
How many are speaking?

105
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:38,285
Two

106
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,426
And we think they do not speak the same soften.

107
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:48,423
- Are you sure that ... - I want you to translate this,

108
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:53,394
And worst, craziest ...

109
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:57,374
I do not know

110
00:12:58,544 --> 00:12:59,511
Can you tell me?

111
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:03,505
I can tell you, it is impossible to translate it from the sound file.

112
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:07,247
I want to be there to interact with them.

113
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,447
You do not have to do it, if only to translate.

114
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,323
I do not need it if I already understand the language, but this ...

115
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:15,520
this....

116
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,287
I know what you're doing,

117
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,494
- Tell me what am I doing? - No to Montana,

118
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:26,495
I can do is to make this into a tourist spectacle?

119
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:29,303
I'm just telling what I needed for this job.

120
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,237
This is not a negotiation.

121
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:35,336
If you refuse this, this opportunity will be lost

122
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,421
Good day

123
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,358
Colonel,

124
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,420
He said it would come to you,

125
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:52,363
Go wondering where their next destination

126
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,366
It is possible.

127
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:56,334
Before you agree,

128
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:59,496
Ask him to send a message of war as translation,

129
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,440
The agreement to share their discoveries will be made tonight,

130
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:15,249
After Russia, China, said it will bergabungung with America.

131
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:18,480
Meanwhile, financial conditions around the world are in crisis,

132
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,288
After the occurrence of turbulence in the industrialized world,

133
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:23,318
more than 2000 points,

134
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:42,346
- Ms. Banks? - Yes?

135
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:46,313
Country call you, you will leave this evening.

136
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:49,481
- You should come with us. - I do not want to leave my house,

137
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:54,390
- We'll take care of it. - Okay give me 20 minutes?

138
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,260
We will not wait long,

139
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:11,428
Sorry, I can not hear what you say

140
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:15,433
Language is evidence of civilization,

141
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:18,308
With language we can unite together,

142
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,505
and with the language well, we can get involved in the conflict,

143
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,509
Louise, this Ian Donnelly,

144
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:26,313
Nn. Banks, The Donnelly

145
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:29,253
- Nice to meet you. - Yes, you too.

146
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:33,348
What are you reading?

147
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,485
And all of it is basic,

148
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,428
Yes, it was great

149
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,488
And nothing against it,

150
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,399
- About what? - Regarding the evidence of civilization,

151
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:44,368
Language as a science,

152
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:49,440
Ian is a linguist,

153
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,443
You and he will cooperate,

154
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:53,274
During this show,

155
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:55,337
Yes, they found the UFO,

156
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:58,282
- There is only one. - There is only one?

157
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:01,411
The most important of all, how they can come in here

158
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:04,320
And we have to make sure they will not bring problems,

159
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:07,315
At least that was the question.

160
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:10,523
And we hope that nothing serious,

161
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:15,296
Why do not we just talk to anyone who mengeluakan that voice?

162
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:19,266
This is not possible,

163
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:23,263
I'll take a coffee,

164
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:27,371
Coffee looks good,

165
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:40,377
We will divide into two groups,

166
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:41,368
Yes, Sir.

167
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:43,404
One will take care of medication,

168
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:46,316
and we'll find out what we can do to stop it,

169
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,459
Leave the jacket and cell phone,

170
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:05,497
Please come with me,

171
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:08,500
Put this one in the eyes of you,

172
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:23,478
Sir,

173
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:26,252
Nn. Banks, and Donnelly,

174
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:29,522
- When did you receive the news? - Last night.

175
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,496
- Same. - Maybe this will be a little stressful,

176
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,521
Are you ready?

177
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,325
- Let's say ... - Who will participate?

178
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:39,361
What will we do in there?

179
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:42,432
Not everyone we asked to translate,

180
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:44,305
We give confidence to you,

181
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:49,372
ask you to make a confidentiality agreement regarding this, please be

182
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:51,413
we are going to start soon,

183
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,509
Has it been no word from them?

184
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,313
Are you currently in treatment? Allergy?

185
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,358
Disease? - No.

186
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:02,417
To keep your system,

187
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:06,227
To make sure you will not run into problems later,

188
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:09,462
We'll take you there,

189
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:40,296
Have you found scientific explanation for it?

190
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,496
You mean that thing? I have not found any

191
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:49,303
whole scientists are investigating, and has already started two hours a

192
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:53,244
It does not take 48 hours to make sure what we're up against it,

193
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:55,372
I am here,

194
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:59,384
Sorry? If they are different from the earth's atmosphere,

195
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:03,445
It certainly takes a few hours to equalize pressure

196
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:05,252
when you open the door,

197
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,350
So, you mean bereka're waiting time?

198
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,328
I want to help, CIA

199
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,322
To me this is just a problem the station alone,

200
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:16,331
Have you got the answer?

201
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,462
Based on what is seen, and its shape,

202
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:21,267
Yes, this will be our priorities,

203
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:25,369
Everybody, this is Dr. Ian Dollanny, he will join us,

204
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:29,540
Is there information about the place, number, and the number of

205
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:32,278
We can not say this to everyone

206
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,445
Please do not misunderstand,

207
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:39,447
How can I help?

208
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:42,289
Same as always, good morning ...

209
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:46,263
This Dr. Louise Banks, he will be your team,

210
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:49,495
- All right, welcome. - Dr. Banks will replace Dr. Walker.

211
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:53,371
50 minutes.

212
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:56,337
Do you need anything?

213
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,243
I hope you're ready for this,

214
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:03,214
Yes, do not worry, this is business as usual,

215
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:06,240
Not to make physical contact with them,

216
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:08,418
If you still want to stay safe,

217
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:12,516
- Understand? - There is a wall that bordered.

218
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:15,482
How would it be?

219
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:18,496
- We'll soon find out. - Hopefully he'll show it to you,

220
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,430
Everything has been issued,

221
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:09,497
The door will be opened soon,

222
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:13,444
Kesanalah we would go,

223
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:48,221
Yes, this happened ...

224
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:32,376
Was talking Pak,

225
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,345
you can continue. Alert!

226
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:36,245
All right, bring upwards.

227
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:49,393
You are okay?

228
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:54,331
Yes

229
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:57,298
Calm down,

230
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:02,239
You can do this,

231
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:04,298
Slowly.

232
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,444
If this....

233
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,237
Dr. Dollanny?

234
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,465
You are okay?

235
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:46,247
Oh, shit!

236
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,445
We will go down now,

237
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:55,283
We knew what we were doing

238
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:57,392
Okay?

239
00:29:57,428 --> 00:30:01,330
- Everything is ready? - I'm everything back into position,

240
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,433
Looks like all is well,

241
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:04,333
We're leaving now.

242
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:30,413
Sir, what happens now?

243
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:35,226
They've arrived,

244
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,477
Thank you

245
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:34,477
- He is fine? - Better than before,

246
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,277
It makes me feel so much better,

247
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:42,481
It will diperlkan before we announce, and make decisions,

248
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,420
Well, what happened sir?

249
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:46,480
Do you come back again,

250
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,294
The chaos continued throughout the United States today,

251
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:29,356
Shortly after the president announced a state of martial law,

252
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:32,359
apparently failed in stabilizing the national security situation of the cour

253
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,462
: of immigrants who take advantage of the opportunity to Masu into the

254
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:40,274
In North Dakota 144 people were reported dead in the city,

255
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:42,302
Once there are outstanding issues that,

256
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:45,214
website it says that the arrival of aliens,

257
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,274
is a manifestation of the revelation earlier ....

258
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:52,286
Jeez ...

259
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:10,271
It was now 15, is already got that?

260
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,367
Yes, we've planned it beforehand,

261
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:14,500
What is at worst?

262
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:18,439
They say we will act decisively to something that is uncertain,

263
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:20,451
What does it mean?

264
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,476
Based on the rumors that emerged,

265
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,284
Arrival of aliens,

266
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:28,356
Without them, we can not do anything.

267
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:04,325
What is that for?

268
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:06,326
I think it is already too late,

269
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:11,265
I could never have had a chance to speak

270
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:14,261
but they seem to have something to say,

271
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:16,302
This is probably not a coincidence,

272
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,331
All right, let's get started.

273
00:36:58,316 --> 00:36:59,340
(Human Being)

274
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:04,379
I am a human,

275
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:08,253
Who are you?

276
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,369
(Human Being)

277
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:12,285
Jeez ...

278
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,281
- You've recorded? - Yes sir, we have record,

279
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:19,291
Please, do not disturb us,

280
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:35,402
(Human Being)

281
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:38,406
(Human Being)

282
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,410
(Human Being)

283
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:55,328
All right, all right,

284
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:16,409
I do not want to be a hindrance your success here.

285
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:19,515
But that was it, really incredible,

286
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,514
Try to understand,

287
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:25,222
With this condition, it will not be long,

288
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:27,457
You're wrong, we already knew it.

289
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:31,435
Take a look at what we can here,

290
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,270
I had to explain to all of them,

291
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:36,239
The first and last question.

292
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,271
How will we be able to use this information,

293
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:40,238
So you do not have to give the warning,

294
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,277
Kangaroo,

295
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:46,305
What is it?

296
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:52,448
. Captain James Cook landed on the coast of Australia and discover the

297
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:54,390
only filled by Aboriginal people

298
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:58,328
When the sailors and animals live together,

299
00:39:58,362 --> 00:40:03,356
n they asked him what his name, and Aboriginal people saying ''Kangar

300
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:11,339
Not many know that the ''kangaroos'' means ''I do not understand''

301
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:17,246
Thus, in this condition, it will take ten times longer,

302
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,439
I think you mean is 'Now'

303
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,389
I wish you could find what they want, before the next session.

304
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:28,382
- OK. - Remember what happened to Aboriginal people.

305
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:31,419
They fought race,

306
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:33,430
And overcoming them,

307
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:42,396
Good story,

308
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,305
Thank you

309
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:48,301
That's not true, they do not know what I mean

310
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:10,332
I know a secret like this back again,

311
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:13,503
That's why I would like to congratulate,

312
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:17,304
l not take long to figure out what they want the bastard. If you can not

313
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,469
They seem to be the inventor of algebra

314
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:22,240
the behavior of complex,

315
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:23,440
That is all...

316
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,410
It does not make sense

317
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:29,441
Did not hear...

318
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:38,352
The problem is not everyone accepts the rules we are happy,

319
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:40,330
You've met with General Shan?

320
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:45,425
It looks like the country is already dominating in Shan transmit fleet

321
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,438
Louise, we must do it quickly,

322
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:50,497
- OK. - You've been saving the form? - Yes.

323
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:00,382
If this military affairs, I am responsible,

324
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:04,310
Yes, so we can study the behavior and name, and ...

325
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,481
pelafalannya.

326
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:07,457
No, I think it was good,

327
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:12,293
Eating, locks, ...

328
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:13,361
I do not understand,

329
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:16,457
Alright

330
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:21,426
No, no, no, do not ...

331
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:29,445
It you want to ask them, right?

332
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:30,504
Yes, that's the question. - OK.

333
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:34,382
So, of course we have to make sure they understand,

334
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:35,476
What is the question.

335
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:37,477
And they will answer

336
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:41,252
This question need the answer or response from them

337
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:44,352
Then, we have to clarify,

338
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:47,262
their specific identity if ''you''

339
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:48,458
and ''you''

340
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:52,401
Because we do not want to know how old our alien

341
00:42:52,436 --> 00:42:55,428
we just want to know, why they landed.

342
00:42:55,472 --> 00:42:59,374
And their purpose, perhaps to entertain

343
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:02,368
We have to find out, what made them aware,

344
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,472
Or their motivation, so we can be sure that

345
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:07,382
They do not understand at all with our question,

346
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:11,411
And above all, we need extensions to the vocabulary sufficient

347
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,356
so that we understand their answers.

348
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,449
Of course!

349
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:19,418
Just continue,

350
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:25,332
only ... Do your best.

351
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:49,520
It's terrible,

352
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:01,369
Louise

353
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:04,303
Louise

354
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:12,449
What is it?

355
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,479
Is it a symbol that we do not know?

356
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:19,389
I do not know, I guess it's kind of symbol depicting humans,

357
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:22,221
I still do not understand,

358
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:24,250
Maybe they're asking questions

359
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:25,319
I have no idea...

360
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:29,322
They could not hear,

361
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:32,393
Louise, show them, the next word.

362
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:54,288
Dr. Banks?

363
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:57,326
What is this?

364
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,394
It is okay,

365
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:02,422
They must see me,

366
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:08,527
Dr. Banks, are you okay?

367
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,304
They must see me.

368
00:45:14,511 --> 00:45:16,240
Dr. Banks!

369
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:20,415
Show me the board

370
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:25,277
Go back to your station.

371
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:56,377
Louise

372
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:01,239
I Louise.

373
00:47:02,386 --> 00:47:04,513
Do you understand this?

374
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,356
Yes

375
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,396
Louise

376
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:19,426
He did not respond,

377
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:26,299
Morrally, do not!

378
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,247
Pak, Dr. Morally also took off his jacket.

379
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,280
End the session.

380
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:52,493
Ian ...

381
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:54,333
Louise ...

382
00:47:56,306 --> 00:47:57,330
You

383
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:00,276
Who are you?

384
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:29,300
I guess that is their names.

385
00:48:33,343 --> 00:48:34,401
That's their name,

386
00:48:34,444 --> 00:48:36,469
Then, we will call them what?

387
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:39,282
I have no idea...

388
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:42,351
I feel they already understand,

389
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:47,286
Yes.

390
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:48,451
Yes, so do I.

391
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:15,378
How do you feel?

392
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:18,447
Tired

393
00:50:18,448 --> 00:50:21,315
We did not think you were desperate to get yourself in danger,

394
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:25,387
I think you're still not ready for something important.

395
00:50:26,323 --> 00:50:27,483
We will give you the results of your blood test,

396
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:30,357
For now it is not that I no longer need.

397
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:34,230
No radiation,

398
00:50:34,464 --> 00:50:38,298
There is nothing else that can be detected on the situation at this time,

399
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:40,497
This is the first time we mentioned this to the congress,

400
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:44,397
Of course!

401
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:46,342
We'll take the risk,

402
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:50,369
Dear dear...

403
00:50:52,315 --> 00:50:54,476
You do not have to worry, okay?

404
00:50:56,353 --> 00:50:58,344
Calm down, calm down,

405
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:04,427
Hey, it's not going to happen,

406
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:10,433
No need to worry,

407
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:30,309
Many things we do not know,

408
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:33,407
Creatures, unknown, strong,

409
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:36,385
8 feet were, or have a face,

410
00:52:38,388 --> 00:52:39,355
Who are they?

411
00:52:40,524 --> 00:52:43,288
try to answer this in a useful way,

412
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:44,486
Everyone's face it,

413
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:47,395
how is it possible we could see them,

414
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:50,365
They did not leave a trace

415
00:52:52,435 --> 00:52:55,336
chemical composition of the air is not known,

416
00:52:55,372 --> 00:52:59,274
The shell does not have the street, has no fuel, and no radiation,

417
00:53:00,277 --> 00:53:02,507
The means used to communicate with others,

418
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:04,480
They do so with the detection,

419
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:08,349
The air between the shade is problematic

420
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:10,250
with the present condition.

421
00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:14,252
Are they scientists, or just a tourist

422
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:17,454
f those scientists are, it seems like they are not a lot of asking questions

423
00:53:20,497 --> 00:53:22,362
If this is compared with the previous one,

424
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,233
They may already be doing exploration in many places.

425
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:29,238
The chances they had reached the place

426
00:53:29,272 --> 00:53:32,264
They need to collect information,

427
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:34,339
By means of their reception,

428
00:53:34,511 --> 00:53:36,308
And browsing is possible,

429
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:38,337
associated with a wide variety of agenda

430
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:40,316
which started in 1980, so ...

431
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:41,408
We do not know,

432
00:53:44,421 --> 00:53:46,218
How do they communicate?

433
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:49,253
Here, Louise would expose

434
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:53,251
The first discovery is no coalition

435
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:55,356
with what happened before

436
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:57,366
and what is happening now.

437
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:15,251
And like all other types of human language,

438
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:17,379
They can be represented in the form of graphs,

439
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:21,255
And can have many meanings conjecture,

440
00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:28,331
maybe they do not want to be known,

441
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:30,230
or maybe too many

442
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:32,531
which must be passed to be able to enter this communication,

443
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:41,342
We had friends in pakistan who can explain this

444
00:54:41,378 --> 00:54:43,243
and know what it means

445
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:45,506
Unfortunately it does not like the speech,

446
00:54:45,515 --> 00:54:48,416
Time for them to freedom,

447
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:54,255
They were impressed with your body,

448
00:54:54,257 --> 00:54:57,226
and their language can not be translated to the macro instructions

449
00:54:57,494 --> 00:55:01,225
The language is referred to as, an unknown language,

450
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:04,257
which begs the question, whether this was their thinking?

451
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:09,336
Imagine if you want to talk to use two hands

452
00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:10,465
Starting from ujunug finger

453
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:14,334
You should be aware of each word you want to use.

454
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:16,502
Just like how much space you want to use.

455
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:22,384
And then to make complex decisions within two seconds,

456
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:26,355
It took months to make an example of his chances.

457
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:29,415
Next, multiply comprising the vocabulary,

458
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,328
I hope we could have used one more month

459
00:55:32,362 --> 00:55:33,351
So that we really ready for it.

460
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:54,307
Hey! - Hey!

461
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:56,451
Botler looking for you,

462
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:59,354
Yes, according to him why I was hiding beyond this?

463
00:56:01,491 --> 00:56:03,322
You want?

464
00:56:09,466 --> 00:56:10,490
The scenery is nice, is not it?

465
00:56:12,235 --> 00:56:13,259
Yes, this is a nice view.

466
00:56:14,437 --> 00:56:16,268
No sound,

467
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:21,344
I was just thinking about you,

468
00:56:24,414 --> 00:56:27,315
Linguistics and manifestasimu, you know that do not you?

469
00:56:30,253 --> 00:56:31,413
I'll take that as a compliment

470
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:34,354
I feel the same,

471
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:41,355
you've been trying to track down this communication that seems like n

472
00:56:42,298 --> 00:56:44,357
What?

473
00:56:46,302 --> 00:56:47,360
I think that's why I'm still single

474
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:52,330
Believe me, you would understand communication with ease.

475
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:04,377
I feel that everything that happened there,

476
00:57:05,522 --> 00:57:07,456
Anything to do with us,

477
00:57:09,392 --> 00:57:11,292
Yes, and it was a good thing is not it?

478
00:57:12,328 --> 00:57:13,352
You and me?

479
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:17,491
Are not you joking?

480
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,331
Or pretend?

481
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:21,495
I have to follow you,

482
00:57:32,382 --> 00:57:36,216
Tonight, the first pictures of aliens became viral

483
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:41,279
Biological contamination has occurred in Montana,

484
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,225
and now they are under pressure,

485
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,428
800 thousand soldiers in Washington

486
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:48,260
has been mobilized to deal with this crisis,

487
00:57:48,264 --> 00:57:50,425
Everything, and plus special forces.

488
00:57:52,502 --> 00:57:56,336
The first contact is still not provide any solution

489
00:57:56,339 --> 00:57:59,240
The government does not know, the same government,

490
00:57:59,242 --> 00:58:01,403
Collecting military force

491
00:58:01,444 --> 00:58:04,379
Look at these people, almost all of them have weapons.

492
00:58:05,381 --> 00:58:09,408
We can use the four basic scale to save the city

493
00:58:09,419 --> 00:58:11,353
which could harm our country

494
00:58:11,354 --> 00:58:13,447
we were sleeping, they were not the original human

495
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,219
You know what happened there,

496
00:58:15,258 --> 00:58:15,519
I know it,

497
00:58:15,525 --> 00:58:17,493
Smart things we can do today,

498
00:58:17,527 --> 00:58:20,325
We provide a personal report

499
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,321
I'm talking about personal rescue

500
00:58:22,365 --> 00:58:24,424
What do you think after seeing all that is happening

501
00:58:24,434 --> 00:58:26,265
What would you do to face this all?

502
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:20,389
They may not consider the earth as a planet

503
00:59:21,424 --> 00:59:23,483
Are you also going to protect us and our class?

504
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:25,392
You're going to lose

505
00:59:29,432 --> 00:59:31,366
I had to set it up for my show

506
00:59:32,368 --> 00:59:33,392
If we had one

507
00:59:34,504 --> 00:59:36,267
I know who the two men,

508
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:37,466
It was Jim and Dad

509
00:59:37,473 --> 00:59:40,408
So they called my father and mother Dr. Helmos

510
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:44,371
That is good

511
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:50,308
Of course!

512
00:59:54,357 --> 00:59:56,484
- You know it's okay if you're upset because your father ... - I know.

513
00:59:56,492 --> 00:59:58,255
I am not sad

514
01:00:00,396 --> 01:00:01,488
Honey, I love you so much,

515
01:00:01,497 --> 01:00:05,365
I know, it's just a cartoon, not real

516
01:00:13,476 --> 01:00:14,443
Yes

517
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:16,412
Yes, I am doing okay,

518
01:00:19,248 --> 01:00:20,408
I'm not sure on anything

519
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:23,510
- I guess that's it. - When was the last time you checked it?

520
01:00:25,488 --> 01:00:26,477
I am alright.

521
01:00:26,522 --> 01:00:29,389
This neighbor Merry

522
01:00:29,392 --> 01:00:31,292
Of course!

523
01:01:38,494 --> 01:01:40,257
I want to sleep, but ...

524
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:42,262
I am fine,

525
01:01:46,269 --> 01:01:49,261
There are things you should read about the idea that

526
01:01:50,339 --> 01:01:52,432
If you translate something into a foreign language, then you ...

527
01:01:52,442 --> 01:01:56,344
- Can think, why did you bring it? - Yes, I think so.

528
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:58,347
I also thought about it

529
01:01:59,248 --> 01:02:00,408
in theory it ...

530
01:02:01,317 --> 01:02:02,443
It is a theory that

531
01:02:03,352 --> 01:02:06,321
Languages will always find what your thinking

532
01:02:06,322 --> 01:02:09,485
Yes, it is said to you, everything you say

533
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:14,457
I'm curious, do you dream of using language as well?

534
01:02:24,507 --> 01:02:27,237
I used to dream but I do not remember.

535
01:02:29,312 --> 01:02:32,281
I guess I will not be possible to do so far

536
01:02:52,401 --> 01:02:54,494
- Do you sleep? - No

537
01:02:55,538 --> 01:02:57,438
Do not worry,

538
01:03:09,552 --> 01:03:11,349
The worst thing is,

539
01:03:11,354 --> 01:03:13,447
We lost contact premises of China's current leaders

540
01:03:15,491 --> 01:03:16,458
General Shan

541
01:03:18,327 --> 01:03:19,294
Telephone

542
01:03:22,398 --> 01:03:25,390
We've already put here who berjuan with them,

543
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:28,327
Try to return,

544
01:03:33,442 --> 01:03:36,434
He said that he would use anything to fight technology,

545
01:03:39,515 --> 01:03:40,447
Retreat again,

546
01:03:40,449 --> 01:03:42,246
then play

547
01:03:45,421 --> 01:03:49,380
He said something related to defense, and resourceful.

548
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:51,486
Sense, I do not know what it means.

549
01:03:52,528 --> 01:03:54,291
Something about setting

550
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:58,391
By pemiliknnya and now, I do not know ...

551
01:04:00,303 --> 01:04:01,292
I do not know about it

552
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:03,305
I also do not want to know more,

553
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:06,308
and I will face the Chinese troops

554
01:04:07,276 --> 01:04:08,402
And now, chaos is imminent

555
01:04:09,445 --> 01:04:11,310
Shan wants to master directly

556
01:04:11,314 --> 01:04:13,407
This serious

557
01:04:16,485 --> 01:04:21,252
Honor, flower ... I think this has something to do,

558
01:04:23,326 --> 01:04:27,422
Do they use the game to protect themselves?

559
01:04:30,233 --> 01:04:30,494
It is possible.

560
01:04:30,499 --> 01:04:33,263
- Why? - Just as I thought

561
01:04:33,302 --> 01:04:35,236
In English.

562
01:04:35,271 --> 01:04:38,297
All conversations will be games,

563
01:04:38,307 --> 01:04:39,399
Each idea will express our position

564
01:04:39,442 --> 01:04:41,501
And victory will be a problem

565
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:45,370
The pattern that they provide is the hammer

566
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:47,349
Everything is a nail

567
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:51,315
We were supposed to be asked

568
01:04:53,322 --> 01:04:54,311
Ready or not.

569
01:05:53,516 --> 01:05:56,417
What was your aim, Professor?

570
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:05,318
Are they merepson

571
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:11,488
Well, that was it.

572
01:06:35,257 --> 01:06:36,281
What did he say?

573
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:47,333
offering weapons

574
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,367
- But you see they are wrong. - Menggunankan word that is not ...

575
01:06:55,277 --> 01:06:56,244
It is enough!

576
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:58,241
Louise

577
01:06:58,414 --> 01:07:00,382
We do not know if they understand,

578
01:07:00,383 --> 01:07:03,477
The difference between the weapon and the other,

579
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:06,420
Due to the influence of culture, sometimes chaos

580
01:07:06,422 --> 01:07:09,289
- The word weapon. - And there is no overview of the

581
01:07:09,325 --> 01:07:11,259
if they ask us, or give something.

582
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:12,318
With what is happening now,

583
01:07:13,329 --> 01:07:14,353
And the only thing we can try,

584
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:16,331
How can we clarify their purpose?

585
01:07:16,332 --> 01:07:17,492
With a loss for words,

586
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:19,297
All right, I'll go back there.

587
01:07:19,335 --> 01:07:21,360
now so that we can clear this problem,

588
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:22,394
This one is complicated,

589
01:07:22,438 --> 01:07:24,269
What could be more complicated than that?

590
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:28,408
Colonel, the defense minister called.

591
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:38,444
We must keep this information until we know what it means.

592
01:07:39,488 --> 01:07:41,319
So we are not going to tell anything to our enemies

593
01:07:41,323 --> 01:07:43,484
we have to disguise that idea, and it's visitors

594
01:07:43,526 --> 01:07:45,289
will avoid us and perform their own way

595
01:07:45,294 --> 01:07:47,285
until there is a fraction of the real

596
01:07:47,329 --> 01:07:48,489
There is no evidence for it. - Correct

597
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:51,324
That's why we have to menrahasiakannya,

598
01:07:52,334 --> 01:07:54,359
England with India, Germany to Rwanda

599
01:07:56,272 --> 01:07:57,500
They even made its name: Hunger

600
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:06,509
The world is now nothing lead.

601
01:08:07,483 --> 01:08:09,451
It was impossible to do that if only we

602
01:08:09,485 --> 01:08:11,419
We must prepare the weapon now

603
01:08:39,482 --> 01:08:40,449
What are they saying?

604
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:44,377
China and Russia are going to do, they speak well

605
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:46,388
What we heard in the last session

606
01:08:46,388 --> 01:08:49,289
Not enough.

607
01:08:50,426 --> 01:08:51,358
Yes, Sir.

608
01:08:51,393 --> 01:08:53,384
We got orders to do the same

609
01:08:53,429 --> 01:08:55,488
- We can not do that. - It's already been decided

610
01:08:55,531 --> 01:08:57,362
- Do denials, - Just do it!

611
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,231
you see a message from ...

612
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:02,237
Shit!

613
01:09:02,505 --> 01:09:04,302
We must talk with each other,

614
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:06,274
You want to talk to them? Find what this means.

615
01:09:22,291 --> 01:09:24,225
We have never reenter the previous session.

616
01:09:25,427 --> 01:09:26,485
Trust me, okay? We have time.

617
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:28,292
We have a step, okay?

618
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:31,299
using weapons

619
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:34,497
It is a message sent alien to the Chinese government

620
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:38,371
On the issue of science that became an international issue today,

621
01:09:39,308 --> 01:09:41,299
In a statement, General Shang said

622
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:44,404
China no longer trust the aliens who want to master the human

623
01:09:44,446 --> 01:09:46,437
Humanity must be protected

624
01:09:46,448 --> 01:09:49,417
China has asked to speak as soon as possible with the United Nations

625
01:10:46,475 --> 01:10:48,466
no, no, you must not go up there anymore. - I just want to ask one que

626
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:49,499
Do not do it.

627
01:10:50,512 --> 01:10:53,481
The reception has been disconnected, you can not go back there,

628
01:10:53,515 --> 01:10:55,483
I just asked for five minutes, do not waste time,

629
01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:57,385
Let him go,

630
01:11:00,422 --> 01:11:01,354
Wait there,

631
01:11:07,396 --> 01:11:09,227
We will call this call what?

632
01:11:09,231 --> 01:11:10,323
Has something happened?

633
01:11:10,366 --> 01:11:12,425
I do not know, we'll just see

634
01:11:20,542 --> 01:11:21,509
what we want to know?

635
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:23,478
They tried to resist the command of Captain Mark

636
01:11:23,512 --> 01:11:25,480
Yes, of course it is not allowed Pak

637
01:11:25,481 --> 01:11:27,244
Why not?

638
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:29,442
Email security officer

639
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:34,313
offering weapons

640
01:11:34,323 --> 01:11:36,291
Question mark

641
01:11:41,363 --> 01:11:42,455
Do you want to offer something to us?

642
01:11:52,508 --> 01:11:55,306
Technology, Press, Method.

643
01:11:55,344 --> 01:11:57,403
Yes, this is a different form,

644
01:11:57,446 --> 01:12:00,313
This segment is much easier.

645
01:12:06,288 --> 01:12:11,487
Take, technology, now

646
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:21,497
What did he do?

647
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:29,436
Captain, I want you to see this

648
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:22,390
Everybody has a right to know what happened here,

649
01:13:28,437 --> 01:13:30,428
Why would he do that?

650
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:32,464
I have no idea

651
01:13:49,324 --> 01:13:51,383
I can not do it with two hands

652
01:15:02,464 --> 01:15:03,328
Louise ...

653
01:15:19,414 --> 01:15:20,381
What is it?

654
01:16:06,295 --> 01:16:08,229
Louise, hey ... calm.

655
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:11,222
As a precaution only, back recline.

656
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:15,392
How are you?

657
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:25,468
How Ian circumstances?

658
01:16:25,514 --> 01:16:27,379
Ian diruang apart, he was fine.

659
01:16:31,386 --> 01:16:34,219
- What happened to us? - It was the act of the soldier

660
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:36,383
they carry out their duties,

661
01:16:39,494 --> 01:16:40,518
What is it?

662
01:16:40,529 --> 01:16:42,429
Calm down, calm down ...

663
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:46,458
We will memastikanmu safe, go back to your place

664
01:16:46,501 --> 01:16:48,401
I want to see it

665
01:16:49,504 --> 01:16:54,373
oo bad you should not be doing it. They will not let go until you're cure

666
01:16:58,413 --> 01:17:01,507
I'll find out what it is, and tell thee

667
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:09,481
It's everything?

668
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:12,427
Is it as easy as they were destroyed by the explosion?

669
01:17:13,495 --> 01:17:15,292
explosion-frequency

670
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:18,433
you see anything?

671
01:17:18,433 --> 01:17:20,298
I still do not know,

672
01:17:20,335 --> 01:17:21,461
I need my team,

673
01:17:21,503 --> 01:17:24,472
And we can not let teams back Louise do this.

674
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:25,440
We should not go,

675
01:17:26,508 --> 01:17:27,372
Glad to see you're up,

676
01:17:27,409 --> 01:17:30,276
We should go back there and explain to them that this was a mistake

677
01:17:30,278 --> 01:17:32,246
- We can not do that. - We must.

678
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:34,407
I felt it was an attack

679
01:17:34,449 --> 01:17:37,441
We can look for the best opportunity to carry out attacks,

680
01:17:37,452 --> 01:17:39,249
immediately after we evacuated,

681
01:17:39,254 --> 01:17:42,382
ere is nothing wrong with them, during their stay, we had to stay behir

682
01:18:17,325 --> 01:18:19,293
But they did not go,

683
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:22,463
I feel this is worse,

684
01:18:27,469 --> 01:18:29,369
China the only one who insisted

685
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:32,431
the military decisions have been made, they will soon launch it in the s

686
01:18:32,474 --> 01:18:36,376
If this happens, we will face a situation that is very brutal

687
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:39,438
Think about it, Is our air force ready?

688
01:18:39,481 --> 01:18:42,314
- Siagalah! - Yes, Sir.

689
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:46,514
Tonight, China became the first firm

690
01:18:46,521 --> 01:18:49,285
declared war against the aliens,

691
01:18:50,358 --> 01:18:53,350
Due to the failure of the diplomatic process undertaken USA

692
01:18:53,361 --> 01:18:57,229
China has confirmed that the attack will start tonight.

693
01:18:57,265 --> 01:19:00,234
with an ultimatum by the commander Shang.

694
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:04,361
n its official statement, General Shang said that the armed forces troop

695
01:19:04,406 --> 01:19:08,342
has asked the aliens to leave the territory within 24 hours

696
01:19:08,343 --> 01:19:10,243
before the destruction,

697
01:19:10,278 --> 01:19:13,338
And called on all world leaders to agree with the actions of China

698
01:19:13,381 --> 01:19:15,315
and take similar steps,

699
01:19:16,318 --> 01:19:19,310
With strong air force weaponry and large,

700
01:19:19,354 --> 01:19:24,257
Pakistan, Russia, and Sudan agreed to follow China's actions.

701
01:19:40,342 --> 01:19:41,309
This might not be a coincidence,

702
01:19:57,492 --> 01:19:59,221
It will take many years,

703
01:20:04,533 --> 01:20:06,330
This shape is what?

704
01:20:14,442 --> 01:20:15,466
- Mom ... - Yes?

705
01:20:16,511 --> 01:20:21,471
- Honey ... - What can we do something ...

706
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:24,475
Where we make a deal, and we'll both benefit.

707
01:20:25,420 --> 01:20:27,320
Compromise?

708
01:20:27,355 --> 01:20:30,518
No, as the competition,

709
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:33,461
But both parties will be happy.

710
01:20:35,463 --> 01:20:36,452
Like a win-win?

711
01:20:37,532 --> 01:20:41,366
- More towards science. - If the affairs of science, just call your father.

712
01:20:56,518 --> 01:20:58,315
Thank you

713
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:11,260
- Forgive me. - It is okay.

714
01:21:18,273 --> 01:21:19,467
What time is it now?

715
01:21:21,276 --> 01:21:22,470
Hours that you never write down

716
01:21:27,449 --> 01:21:29,280
You took something instead?

717
01:21:30,318 --> 01:21:31,307
Yes, come here.

718
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:34,355
Take a look at this section,

719
01:21:35,290 --> 01:21:36,382
It looks like it is talking about the time,

720
01:21:36,424 --> 01:21:38,358
There are so many symbols of time,

721
01:21:39,294 --> 01:21:40,261
Available everywhere,

722
01:21:40,495 --> 01:21:41,462
Then what is this?

723
01:21:43,365 --> 01:21:45,265
I think this could cause problems

724
01:21:46,434 --> 01:21:47,401
Who knows?

725
01:21:48,503 --> 01:21:51,472
Too many patterns, complicated

726
01:21:51,506 --> 01:21:53,303
We did not know it until where,

727
01:21:56,411 --> 01:21:57,378
It is here,

728
01:21:58,513 --> 01:22:00,378
Everything is gathered in one place,

729
01:22:00,382 --> 01:22:04,478
How much space is needed, how much space is left.

730
01:22:06,454 --> 01:22:09,321
If we combine,

731
01:22:10,292 --> 01:22:11,520
Will be a wave 833

732
01:22:18,366 --> 01:22:19,492
Maybe you'll consider it as a fraction.

733
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:25,331
One thing is certain,

734
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:31,470
We wanted to say here is, this is one of the twelve

735
01:22:31,513 --> 01:22:33,413
We must give greater hope,

736
01:22:33,448 --> 01:22:35,416
Or there are twelve who expect the same

737
01:22:35,417 --> 01:22:37,214
Why do we have to talk to him?

738
01:22:37,252 --> 01:22:38,344
We are all responsible for this,

739
01:22:38,386 --> 01:22:40,445
We must talk to the other side

740
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:43,288
We must help them so that they could leave,

741
01:22:43,325 --> 01:22:45,259
In case you do not remember, we do not know anything

742
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:48,320
China has decided to destroy aircraft meraka, it's their decision.

743
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:49,490
We can put together the fragments

744
01:22:49,531 --> 01:22:51,499
I tell you, no one cares.

745
01:22:52,534 --> 01:22:56,300
Two hours ago we gave it to the Russian security

746
01:22:56,304 --> 01:22:58,363
and they could not broadcast its scientific reason

747
01:23:02,277 --> 01:23:05,246
The final decision is said by aliens, is no time.

748
01:23:05,547 --> 01:23:07,378
All into one,

749
01:23:08,316 --> 01:23:09,476
I feel we all have been given weapons

750
01:23:09,517 --> 01:23:12,247
Do you want to do this?

751
01:23:13,321 --> 01:23:14,310
Please.

752
01:23:19,527 --> 01:23:22,291
I mean,

753
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:24,489
ere are so many races that you can not understand what they were sayi

754
01:23:24,499 --> 01:23:27,332
I do not need any interpretation to interpret it,

755
01:23:27,335 --> 01:23:29,360
Russia has just execute one of their expert

756
01:23:29,371 --> 01:23:31,236
To keep their secrets,

757
01:23:31,239 --> 01:23:35,198
e is someone who could be sent there to keep an eye on what is happe

758
01:23:35,477 --> 01:23:38,378
Why do we only send the parts of the course? Why not all at once?

759
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:40,371
because we have to work together to do this,

760
01:23:42,283 --> 01:23:45,343
Although I trust you, how to make the world want to come to do this?

761
01:23:45,387 --> 01:23:47,321
and provide their data,

762
01:23:48,356 --> 01:23:49,380
We had a few hours to get back,

763
01:23:51,292 --> 01:23:53,351
- Yes. - Betrayal?

764
01:23:53,361 --> 01:23:54,487
No one to blame,

765
01:23:58,299 --> 01:23:59,459
Not a game vain,

766
01:24:01,403 --> 01:24:03,268
That's it, yes

767
01:24:03,471 --> 01:24:04,403
Thank you

768
01:24:11,413 --> 01:24:14,348
I've ordered those who had landed to return.

769
01:24:15,383 --> 01:24:17,283
The only way to approach them is by walking around

770
01:24:17,318 --> 01:24:19,286
and through the guard them, but ...

771
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:21,345
- That will not be fast enough. - There must be another way,

772
01:24:21,389 --> 01:24:23,448
We are still given a chance in two hours

773
01:24:23,491 --> 01:24:25,356
to return to the stage that has been determined

774
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:28,420
aka we need all the countries in the world

775
01:24:28,463 --> 01:24:30,294
united to run

776
01:24:30,298 --> 01:24:32,391
and there is no way to avoid it.

777
01:24:33,435 --> 01:24:34,402
Wait a minute!

778
01:24:34,436 --> 01:24:37,428
True, this is Jeff honnor

779
01:24:39,374 --> 01:24:40,466
We're doing it now

780
01:24:40,508 --> 01:24:43,409
We've been assured Italy

781
01:24:44,379 --> 01:24:46,438
I think the brand will begin the evacuation process in one hour

782
01:24:48,283 --> 01:24:49,341
See, it will not easy,

783
01:24:49,384 --> 01:24:51,215
No results were seen progressive

784
01:24:51,252 --> 01:24:53,243
Perhaps only a few are aggressive

785
01:24:53,254 --> 01:24:54,414
It becomes a question

786
01:24:55,390 --> 01:24:56,357
Or what to do?

787
01:24:57,292 --> 01:25:00,261
How can we menakhlukkannya if we do not know him?

788
01:25:01,329 --> 01:25:02,387
I think it all should end

789
01:25:03,465 --> 01:25:05,365
We will submit it to the hands of experts now

790
01:29:02,270 --> 01:29:03,294
Abbot is the process of death,

791
01:29:20,455 --> 01:29:21,422
Sorry,

792
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:25,348
Where Morrellyn?

793
01:29:30,264 --> 01:29:31,288
I want you....

794
01:29:33,267 --> 01:29:34,461
I want you to send a message

795
01:29:34,469 --> 01:29:36,232
To the other side

796
01:29:43,244 --> 01:29:46,236
Louise had a weapon.

797
01:29:54,288 --> 01:29:56,347
Use of weapons

798
01:29:57,458 --> 01:29:59,255
I do not understand,

799
01:30:01,295 --> 01:30:02,387
Is this a ramalanmu?

800
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:14,331
We help humankind.

801
01:30:18,379 --> 01:30:22,440
In the three hundred years ...

802
01:30:24,318 --> 01:30:27,378
we need human assistance,

803
01:30:29,524 --> 01:30:32,220
How will you be able to know the future?

804
01:30:49,243 --> 01:30:50,267
My daughter ...

805
01:30:52,246 --> 01:30:53,338
I do not understand,

806
01:30:54,282 --> 01:30:55,340
I'm still a child,

807
01:31:01,389 --> 01:31:04,222
He called the father and mother of the animal.

808
01:31:16,504 --> 01:31:20,304
Louise saw the future

809
01:31:30,351 --> 01:31:34,310
Weapons opening time

810
01:31:40,361 --> 01:31:41,453
No, wait ...

811
01:32:31,379 --> 01:32:33,347
Jeez, Louise, are you okay?

812
01:32:40,488 --> 01:32:43,423
It's okay now

813
01:32:43,457 --> 01:32:45,448
They've evacuated

814
01:32:45,459 --> 01:32:48,292
- What? - Russia will follow China

815
01:32:52,366 --> 01:32:53,390
I do not understand,

816
01:32:53,434 --> 01:32:54,366
Help me, Mom

817
01:32:56,337 --> 01:32:57,361
Louise?

818
01:32:58,439 --> 01:33:00,236
Mother...

819
01:33:02,343 --> 01:33:03,401
Mother...

820
01:33:06,347 --> 01:33:07,336
Sorry dear...

821
01:33:11,319 --> 01:33:13,310
These days what honey?

822
01:33:13,321 --> 01:33:15,346
Sunday.

823
01:33:20,461 --> 01:33:22,395
Are you going as well as that of the father?

824
01:33:24,432 --> 01:33:26,423
Hanna, the father did not leave you,

825
01:33:27,401 --> 01:33:29,301
You'll meet her this weekend.

826
01:33:30,538 --> 01:33:32,529
But I also want to see more of him.

827
01:33:42,249 --> 01:33:44,274
This is my fault,

828
01:33:45,519 --> 01:33:48,352
I said something that she is still not ready to hear

829
01:33:51,258 --> 01:33:52,418
What?

830
01:33:56,364 --> 01:33:57,353
Believe it or not,

831
01:33:58,499 --> 01:34:00,490
I know something will happen

832
01:34:03,437 --> 01:34:05,405
I can not explain why I know, I just might.

833
01:34:07,508 --> 01:34:10,409
When I speak to your father, he was furious.

834
01:34:12,513 --> 01:34:14,413
He left me no choice,

835
01:34:17,518 --> 01:34:20,282
What will happen?

836
01:34:23,457 --> 01:34:27,291
It has to do with a very rare disease

837
01:34:30,464 --> 01:34:32,489
and this is not going to stop,

838
01:34:34,402 --> 01:34:36,370
Not like you,

839
01:34:37,338 --> 01:34:38,305
You are so kind,

840
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:43,240
And you are the most incredible thing in my life.

841
01:34:44,345 --> 01:34:46,245
Amy stopped

842
01:35:10,404 --> 01:35:15,239
Orson, I just know that eventually you're going to leave me,

843
01:35:16,277 --> 01:35:17,335
Orson, you left me,

844
01:35:17,378 --> 01:35:19,346
What are you talking about?

845
01:35:19,346 --> 01:35:21,439
Let's go from here,

846
01:35:56,350 --> 01:35:57,476
- Mama ... - Yes.

847
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:01,254
Why my name is Hannah?

848
01:36:06,527 --> 01:36:09,257
Your name is very special

849
01:36:09,263 --> 01:36:13,393
cause of the special language that means it will be the same if the read

850
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:15,368
Forward and backward.

851
01:36:51,505 --> 01:36:54,474
Hey, we're done here,

852
01:36:54,475 --> 01:36:56,466
Your time is up ...

853
01:37:21,535 --> 01:37:22,467
I could read it,

854
01:37:27,408 --> 01:37:28,375
I know what it is,

855
01:37:28,409 --> 01:37:31,344
- What? - It's not a weapon, it's a talent.

856
01:37:32,379 --> 01:37:34,244
Weapon is their language,

857
01:37:34,248 --> 01:37:37,376
- But that means is talent. - You sure about that?

858
01:37:37,418 --> 01:37:41,445
- There is no guarantee for that. - If you learn it, you can feel

859
01:37:42,389 --> 01:37:44,380
They allow time for us to understand,

860
01:37:44,425 --> 01:37:46,484
So we can see what they mean,

861
01:37:47,428 --> 01:37:49,419
Time, it's not the same thing,

862
01:37:50,364 --> 01:37:51,331
It was not linear,

863
01:37:52,433 --> 01:37:53,457
I still do not understand,

864
01:37:56,303 --> 01:37:57,361
Captain, we've all been completed.

865
01:37:57,371 --> 01:37:59,236
We all have to get out of here in five minutes,

866
01:37:59,506 --> 01:38:02,475
And Louise, there's nothing we can do anymore,

867
01:38:04,378 --> 01:38:05,310
Good luck

868
01:38:17,424 --> 01:38:18,482
I would look for a weapon for us

869
01:38:27,334 --> 01:38:29,302
Wake up, Mom,

870
01:39:05,272 --> 01:39:06,432
Good night,

871
01:39:09,476 --> 01:39:10,443
General Shang

872
01:39:10,444 --> 01:39:12,412
I feel happy, really.

873
01:39:13,380 --> 01:39:18,408
Presidenmu said you are the guest of honor at the ceremony.

874
01:39:18,452 --> 01:39:21,387
But I admit,

875
01:39:21,388 --> 01:39:24,357
You're not vain

876
01:39:25,526 --> 01:39:27,460
I'm glad to meet you in person,

877
01:39:28,529 --> 01:39:31,259
I'm flattered, thank you.

878
01:39:32,366 --> 01:39:34,231
You did well

879
01:39:34,468 --> 01:39:36,436
You're doing something that deserves to be remembered

880
01:39:36,470 --> 01:39:40,463
Something that even I had never done in my power.

881
01:39:42,509 --> 01:39:44,238
What is it?

882
01:39:44,244 --> 01:39:47,304
You changed my mind,

883
01:39:48,415 --> 01:39:51,509
You are the reason for this implication,

884
01:39:53,287 --> 01:39:56,347
That's because you can reach me at my private number,

885
01:39:59,259 --> 01:40:02,387
General personal number? I do not even know your personal number.

886
01:40:10,237 --> 01:40:11,397
Now you know.

887
01:40:13,540 --> 01:40:16,407
I want to tell you, how this might work but ..

888
01:40:17,511 --> 01:40:21,242
I believe it is important for you to say it.

889
01:40:23,283 --> 01:40:24,307
I'll call you tonight,

890
01:40:25,519 --> 01:40:27,282
You'd better be.

891
01:40:39,366 --> 01:40:40,355
Louise ...

892
01:40:56,517 --> 01:40:58,348
Okay, now it's all out of here.

893
01:40:58,385 --> 01:41:00,353
Good, Sir

894
01:41:00,387 --> 01:41:02,480
There is a call out to China,

895
01:41:05,426 --> 01:41:06,450
Here? What do you mean here?

896
01:41:12,332 --> 01:41:13,264
Who telephoned?

897
01:41:18,272 --> 01:41:19,261
Mobile pack.

898
01:41:26,447 --> 01:41:28,278
Search basekamp now

899
01:41:28,282 --> 01:41:30,273
Find who meggunakan phone

900
01:41:30,317 --> 01:41:32,342
Hold in the coordinates. - Good, Sir.

901
01:41:34,388 --> 01:41:36,379
Come on, answer ...

902
01:41:36,390 --> 01:41:38,358
Answer ...

903
01:41:51,438 --> 01:41:53,463
I will never forget what you said

904
01:42:05,252 --> 01:42:07,482
You tell me why the weapon was not functioning.

905
01:42:09,423 --> 01:42:11,482
Answer ...

906
01:42:18,499 --> 01:42:23,232
Just in time, and you came to me,

907
01:42:26,273 --> 01:42:28,537
I was instructed to immediately end the call, now.

908
01:42:34,448 --> 01:42:36,279
- What are you doing? - There is no more time.

909
01:42:36,316 --> 01:42:37,476
Wait 20 seconds.

910
01:42:39,319 --> 01:42:40,479
Give me 20 seconds, would you believe me?

911
01:42:40,487 --> 01:42:42,455
- OK. - Trust me.

912
01:42:45,392 --> 01:42:49,226
Dr. Banks, turn off the phone, or we'll shoot.

913
01:42:52,299 --> 01:42:54,392
- Drop your phone. - Forgive me!

914
01:42:57,404 --> 01:42:59,269
I'm going to count to three

915
01:43:04,511 --> 01:43:05,478
- Yes ... - Drop it!

916
01:43:05,512 --> 01:43:08,276
It is finished already.

917
01:43:14,421 --> 01:43:15,479
Excuse me...

918
01:43:17,491 --> 01:43:19,356
Excuse me...

919
01:45:52,412 --> 01:45:54,505
So, Hannah

920
01:45:56,416 --> 01:45:58,384
That story begins,

921
01:46:01,288 --> 01:46:02,312
On the day when we departed

922
01:46:07,327 --> 01:46:08,385
You are okay?

923
01:46:11,531 --> 01:46:14,295
In addition to knowing this trip,

924
01:46:14,301 --> 01:46:16,360
and why we won,

925
01:46:19,373 --> 01:46:21,238
I deal with it

926
01:46:23,410 --> 01:46:26,345
and I welcome any time

927
01:46:41,495 --> 01:46:46,432
HANNAH

928
01:47:00,313 --> 01:47:05,512
- If it is read from the back? - HANNAH

929
01:47:05,519 --> 01:47:08,488
Are you ready?

930
01:47:19,366 --> 01:47:20,424
Father...

931
01:47:30,243 --> 01:47:31,267
You are okay?

932
01:47:41,421 --> 01:47:43,286
All right, we'll start our affairs

933
01:47:45,392 --> 01:47:47,223
- Ian? - Yes.

934
01:47:48,428 --> 01:47:50,521
If you can see all of this from the beginning to the end,

935
01:47:54,267 --> 01:47:55,325
Tries left,

936
01:48:02,275 --> 01:48:03,333
Maybe yes,

937
01:48:04,344 --> 01:48:07,313
And I would agree with you,

938
01:48:23,330 --> 01:48:27,266
Directly I would face this alone, as long as I can remember.

939
01:48:30,270 --> 01:48:31,430
It will make both of us by surprise,

940
01:48:34,374 --> 01:48:35,466
It always means a lot to them,

941
01:48:41,348 --> 01:48:42,406
This means you,

942
01:49:23,423 --> 01:49:26,256
God knows there is nothing more important to me besides you.

943
01:49:36,369 --> 01:49:37,461
We'll get through it all dear.

944
01:50:12,439 --> 01:50:13,463
Yes

945
01:50:13,506 --> 01:50:16,270
Yes

946
01:50:32,258 --> 01:50:35,318
ARRIVAL
