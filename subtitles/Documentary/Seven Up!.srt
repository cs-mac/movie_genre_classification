1
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:43,312
World in
 Action...

2
00:00:43,681 --> 00:00:44,765
enters the
 struggling,

3
00:00:44,765 --> 00:00:45,907
changing
 world...

4
00:00:46,345 --> 00:00:48,128
of the 
seven year old.

5
00:00:52,861 --> 00:00:54,980
They're teddy bears,
 they're not real.

6
00:00:57,782 --> 00:01:00,880
A Polar, look 
at those claws.

7
00:01:01,534 --> 00:01:03,332
This is no ordinary
outing to the zoo.

8
00:01:03,735 --> 00:01:05,391
It's a very 
special ocassion.

9
00:01:05,986 --> 00:01:09,220
We brought these twenty children
together for the very first time.

10
00:01:12,487 --> 00:01:13,721
They are like any
 other children...

11
00:01:14,033 --> 00:01:18,224
except that they come from
startlingly different backgrounds.

12
00:01:19,907 --> 00:01:22,301
No! 
No feeding, it says.

13
00:01:29,747 --> 00:01:31,663
Stop it 
at once

14
00:01:33,899 --> 00:01:37,379
I know there's no feeding but it
doesn't really matter.

15
00:01:38,876 --> 00:01:40,030
We brought these
 children together...

16
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:41,872
because we 
wanted a glimpse of...

17
00:01:42,343 --> 00:01:45,075
England in 
the year 2000.

18
00:01:46,707 --> 00:01:52,374
The shop stewards and the executives of
the year 2000 are now seven years old.

19
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,000
Give me a child 
until he is seven...

20
00:01:56,537 --> 00:01:58,633
and I will give
 you the man.

21
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,341
Let's get to know
 these children.

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,380
Taking her little sister to school on
the London Council Estate,

23
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:11,447
Jackie.

24
00:02:20,843 --> 00:02:22,455
From the 
Yorkshire Dales,

25
00:02:23,066 --> 00:02:24,117
Nicholas.

26
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,797
He goes to a one 
room village school...

27
00:02:29,265 --> 00:02:31,371
four miles away
 from his home.

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,238
From this
 Liverpool suburb...

29
00:02:38,969 --> 00:02:39,734
We chose...

30
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,326
Neil.

31
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,524
And this
 is Tony.

32
00:03:03,088 --> 00:03:05,796
His girl friend
calls him a monkey.

33
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,329
He goes to one of
the oldest schools...

34
00:03:14,978 --> 00:03:16,730
in the East End 
of London.

35
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,251
Would everybody,
please sit round now?

36
00:03:45,565 --> 00:03:48,826
Get on with their work, I don't want
to see any backs to me.

37
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,248
Shouldn't be anybody
 turning around...

38
00:03:51,567 --> 00:03:53,100
Tony, do you 
hear as well?

39
00:03:54,647 --> 00:03:56,550
Next to Tony there
is his girl friend,

40
00:03:57,092 --> 00:03:58,081
Michelle.

41
00:03:58,081 --> 00:03:59,200
Tony!

42
00:04:00,092 --> 00:04:01,700
Don't turn
 around again!

43
00:04:14,279 --> 00:04:16,494
In this class room,
Waltzing Matilda...

44
00:04:17,002 --> 00:04:19,263
is being 
rendered in Latin.

45
00:04:20,153 --> 00:04:22,205
This is an exclusive
pre-prep school...

46
00:04:22,753 --> 00:04:24,219
in Kensington.

47
00:04:27,998 --> 00:04:29,840
I think the 
Beatles are mad...

48
00:04:30,091 --> 00:04:31,904
because they make
 too much noise...

49
00:04:32,453 --> 00:04:34,746
and their 
hair-style's so bad.

50
00:04:35,017 --> 00:04:36,369
If they 
composed

51
00:04:37,955 --> 00:04:39,418
softer music...

52
00:04:40,186 --> 00:04:41,879
I wouldn't 
mind so much.

53
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,838
I just loathe 
their hair-cuts

54
00:04:45,935 --> 00:04:47,041
That was John.

55
00:04:47,448 --> 00:04:48,687
If you loathe their hair-cut...

56
00:04:49,308 --> 00:04:53,166
you wouldn't have liked
Henry the Fifths hair-cut.

57
00:04:58,272 --> 00:04:59,916
This is Charles.

58
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:05,959
And that is Andrew.

59
00:05:12,152 --> 00:05:14,293
This dormetary is in 
a children's home...

60
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:16,564
supported by charity.

61
00:05:22,254 --> 00:05:23,163
This is Paul...

62
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,069
and Simon.

63
00:05:30,287 --> 00:05:34,662
I had a dream when all the
world was on top of me...

64
00:05:35,713 --> 00:05:39,852
and everything was on me,
and I just about got out

65
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,820
and everything flew up in the air...

66
00:05:43,936 --> 00:05:45,936
and that all landed on my head.

67
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,039
Go on Potter.

68
00:05:49,747 --> 00:05:50,895
If you don't now, don't go.

69
00:05:51,701 --> 00:05:52,764
Now shoot!
- We're going to!

70
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:59,603
My heart's desire is to see my daddy
who is six thousand miles away.

71
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:03,618
Bruce doesn't live with
 his parents either...

72
00:06:03,618 --> 00:06:04,764
but for a different reason.

73
00:06:05,273 --> 00:06:07,382
He goes to a private 
boarding school in Surrey.

74
00:06:08,371 --> 00:06:10,720
Bruce wants to
 be a missionary.

75
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:16,371
I think the most important thing in the 
world is everyone should know about god.

76
00:06:16,984 --> 00:06:20,607
I think we should give all... some...

77
00:06:21,012 --> 00:06:23,477
most of our money to the poor people.

78
00:06:31,673 --> 00:06:32,931
In the head mistress' study...

79
00:06:33,202 --> 00:06:35,300
of a fashionable school for girls...

80
00:06:35,844 --> 00:06:37,970
we met Suzie.

81
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:43,190
We spoke to her "deep in the
chintz" of the staff room.

82
00:06:44,552 --> 00:06:46,552
Tell us, do you have 
any boyfriend Suzie?

83
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,272
Ummm...

84
00:06:49,896 --> 00:06:52,139
yes!
-Tell me about him.

85
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:57,866
He's up in Scotland
and I think he's thirteen.

86
00:06:59,105 --> 00:07:04,898
and I'm rather lonely up there
because he usually goes to school.

87
00:07:05,244 --> 00:07:06,897
but we usually play till about...

88
00:07:07,623 --> 00:07:10,968
half past six when he
comes home from school.

89
00:07:11,461 --> 00:07:12,977
Then we go in and then...

90
00:07:13,854 --> 00:07:15,911
he goes home to do his homework.

91
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,559
The world of the seven year old...

92
00:07:20,226 --> 00:07:22,533
can be primitive... even violent.

93
00:07:55,043 --> 00:07:58,491
What do the children themselves
think about fighting?

94
00:07:59,334 --> 00:08:02,758
Is it important to fight? Yes!

95
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:08,365
Well I feel like joining in
when there's already a fight.

96
00:08:09,886 --> 00:08:11,443
I always feel like that.

97
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:16,777
I always feel like joining in
when there's already one.

98
00:08:17,576 --> 00:08:19,831
Neil from the Liverpool suburb.

99
00:08:21,046 --> 00:08:25,463
We don't do much fighting in school
because we think it's horrible and

100
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:26,492
It hurts.

101
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:31,767
Sometimes we play nice with the boys
and sometimes we argue with the boys.

102
00:08:31,767 --> 00:08:35,613
- Susan, Jackie's friend.
- Do you ever fight with them?
- No, just argue

103
00:08:35,691 --> 00:08:39,133
Most of the time we are all right.
But. one day when

104
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,660
I remember we were
all coming to school and

105
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:47,111
at break time they started hitting us
and so we started to fight!

106
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:50,702
so we said we're never gonna
play with you again.

107
00:08:51,007 --> 00:08:52,707
But we always do.

108
00:08:53,474 --> 00:09:00,565
If they fight me I think someone if 
someone comes up and starts fighting...

109
00:09:00,971 --> 00:09:02,799
then I think it serves them right

110
00:09:03,218 --> 00:09:06,142
We play with Richard the
 Lion Heart and William Tell.

111
00:09:07,057 --> 00:09:09,218
Well... we pretend we got swords...

112
00:09:09,754 --> 00:09:12,248
and then we make the
 noises of the sword-fighting...

113
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:15,699
and when somebody stabs us we'll go
....'aaaaaahh'!

114
00:09:16,332 --> 00:09:17,496
Nicholas from Yorkshire...

115
00:09:17,703 --> 00:09:18,707
seven this year.

116
00:09:20,034 --> 00:09:22,442
I have quite a lot of
fun when I fight...

117
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:29,984
I always like to wait till someone...
you better watch out for me...

118
00:09:30,374 --> 00:09:32,105
because as soon
 as you're not looking...

119
00:09:32,474 --> 00:09:38,419
I like to dash up and put my hands
in front and hit them against your back.

120
00:09:39,164 --> 00:09:40,009
And on the grass...

121
00:09:40,569 --> 00:09:43,209
we... we play international wrestling.

122
00:09:43,697 --> 00:09:45,572
Yeah that's only in the
 summer time though.

123
00:09:46,198 --> 00:09:48,056
yes summer we
can go on the grass.

124
00:09:48,318 --> 00:09:51,998
I just like fighting somehow.
- Yes, tell me about it.

125
00:09:52,211 --> 00:09:59,376
I just want to. He was in the
washroom and threw soap at me

126
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,811
I chased him in the 
class and I hit him

127
00:10:04,096 --> 00:10:06,499
When I was down in 
the place at Kent...

128
00:10:07,227 --> 00:10:12,995
there was this little boy who I think
was younger than me... and...

129
00:10:14,256 --> 00:10:16,727
my Nanny was having
 a game with him...

130
00:10:18,003 --> 00:10:21,556
and he was a naughty boy because
he slapped me in the tummy.

131
00:10:22,381 --> 00:10:24,985
Some boys can be nice and
 others can be horrible.

132
00:10:25,934 --> 00:10:28,242
And then he slapped Nanny...

133
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,000
and I didn't like
 that kind of boys.

134
00:10:31,576 --> 00:10:34,700
Jacqueline, what do you think
about boys fighting?

135
00:10:35,056 --> 00:10:37,962
Well... its really silly
 to fight because...

136
00:10:38,546 --> 00:10:43,210
if you fight and Miss comes in the 
class-room then you only get told off

137
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:46,257
I think discipline is fair enough.

138
00:10:46,493 --> 00:10:51,289
Farmer is the sergeant and he is quite
a good one, last term he wasn't...

139
00:10:51,965 --> 00:10:53,228
He had a cold

140
00:10:53,949 --> 00:10:57,076
and he didn't want to wear his
voice out from shouting.

141
00:11:05,982 --> 00:11:09,895
And that's Farmer.
He gives me nightmares.

142
00:11:40,024 --> 00:11:42,648
The vast majority of the seven years
olds know little of discipline.

143
00:11:43,832 --> 00:11:45,633
But a few, from the
moment they are born...

144
00:11:46,087 --> 00:11:47,416
are trained to accept it.

145
00:11:49,419 --> 00:11:51,391
squad steady

146
00:11:52,615 --> 00:11:55,241
squad left foot
in one place

147
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:58,641
squad breathe in

148
00:12:14,632 --> 00:12:17,370
Well I don't like

149
00:12:18,152 --> 00:12:21,162
the big boys
hitting us

150
00:12:21,505 --> 00:12:26,926
The prefects sending us
out for nothing. And they

151
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,084
the staff in washroom
sends the nurse out

152
00:12:30,693 --> 00:12:34,415
where there is no talking, no
I wasn't talking today...

153
00:12:34,415 --> 00:12:36,781
and Brown set me up for nothing.

154
00:12:37,794 --> 00:12:40,744
I think the system
of having House Captains...

155
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:44,942
is rather good because when
somebody's naughty

156
00:12:45,568 --> 00:12:51,814
the House Captain asks him and...
and... and has a talk to him.

157
00:12:52,818 --> 00:12:55,661
Once I had a talk to Gravel
he was in my house...

158
00:12:57,335 --> 00:13:02,759
and...and I asked Sir he could put him
out of my house because...

159
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:04,858
he was always getting minuses.

160
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,328
What did the sir say?
-Yes.

161
00:13:07,608 --> 00:13:09,162
The sir said that he was...

162
00:13:09,626 --> 00:13:12,910
he... we would see
about it this term.

163
00:13:14,142 --> 00:13:16,236
Well... I think
it's a very good system.

164
00:13:16,236 --> 00:13:18,000
And you had to
speak to anyone?

165
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,839
Just because you
are one, I suppose.

166
00:13:20,593 --> 00:13:21,945
No, no,
I haven't.

167
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:23,227
You're not
are you?

168
00:13:23,508 --> 00:13:27,746
But I am. Straull Meckanace.
got three minuses in a day.

169
00:13:28,853 --> 00:13:29,760
He is
a pest.

170
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,291
You think, House Captain should be
elected or appointed by sir?

171
00:13:33,585 --> 00:13:34,384
Appointed.

172
00:13:34,686 --> 00:13:35,611
Appointed

173
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,797
I think its more
fair to have elected.

174
00:13:37,797 --> 00:13:40,843
Yes. So do I but I think it is best
to be appointed. -Because you didn't...

175
00:13:41,184 --> 00:13:43,374
It saves lot of time.
-It doesn't!

176
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,622
Appointed!

177
00:13:45,308 --> 00:13:48,232
It is much easier because all
that you have to do is...

178
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,100
count up the pluses and here
you are.  -Yes!

179
00:13:52,887 --> 00:13:53,684
At Suzie's
school...

180
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,788
the exercise
is classical ballet.

181
00:14:06,531 --> 00:14:07,625
For Neil and
his classmates...

182
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:09,974
its free
movement to music.

183
00:14:20,308 --> 00:14:24,391
Michelle and her friends are
left to amuse themselves.

184
00:14:31,697 --> 00:14:37,550
This distinction between freedom and
discipline is the key to their whole future.

185
00:15:12,349 --> 00:15:13,659
What about
after school?

186
00:15:14,718 --> 00:15:16,827
What do they do
in their spare time?

187
00:15:18,408 --> 00:15:20,418
When I've gone
home, I have tea.

188
00:15:21,066 --> 00:15:23,372
Then I practice
my piano.

189
00:15:24,346 --> 00:15:26,659
And then I
practice my recorder.

190
00:15:27,768 --> 00:15:30,215
Then I start
watching television.

191
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,805
What time do
you go to bed?

192
00:15:33,236 --> 00:15:36,089
When I have my
bath at six o'clock...

193
00:15:37,417 --> 00:15:41,567
and then go to bed at seven and
read till half past seven.

194
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:46,282
I usually go to bed at ten o'clock
or eleven o'clock.

195
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:48,737
When I
go home...

196
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,086
I go and
see my mother...

197
00:15:51,894 --> 00:15:54,226
and I have tea
and watch t.v....

198
00:15:58,305 --> 00:16:03,811
and then I... I do my homework and
then I go and see my father.

199
00:16:05,126 --> 00:16:07,526
And then what
time do you go to bed?

200
00:16:10,264 --> 00:16:12,898
last night I didn't go
to bed until seven.

201
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:15,900
When I go
home, I come...

202
00:16:16,314 --> 00:16:19,043
I come in and mummy
gives me a cup of tea...

203
00:16:19,576 --> 00:16:21,062
and then I go
out and play.

204
00:16:21,788 --> 00:16:23,868
And when it
starts to get dark...

205
00:16:24,329 --> 00:16:26,868
I come in again
and put on t.v.

206
00:17:05,132 --> 00:17:11,664
I am the only child in the village
except for my baby brother.

207
00:17:12,514 --> 00:17:15,310
he was one
last Friday...

208
00:17:16,154 --> 00:17:18,414
I mean the friday
before last Friday...

209
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:26,350
Neil from
Liverpool,

210
00:17:26,674 --> 00:17:29,496
said he prefered
living in town.

211
00:17:30,158 --> 00:17:32,768
Because in the winter, if
you lived in the country...

212
00:17:33,346 --> 00:17:36,735
it would be just all be wet and there
wouldn't be anything for miles around

213
00:17:38,097 --> 00:17:43,484
And you get soaked if you try to go out
and there's no shelter anywhere...

214
00:17:43,768 --> 00:17:44,921
except in your own house.

215
00:17:45,185 --> 00:17:46,926
But in the town
you can go out on...

216
00:17:47,236 --> 00:17:50,457
wet, wintery days because you
can always find somewhere to shelter...

217
00:17:50,687 --> 00:17:52,700
because there
are lots of places.

218
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:57,218
They'd like to come out for a holiday
in the country when we like...

219
00:17:57,779 --> 00:18:00,852
when I like the
holiday in the town.

220
00:18:13,254 --> 00:18:14,849
In Tony and
Michelle's school...

221
00:18:15,236 --> 00:18:15,929
unlike
others...

222
00:18:16,353 --> 00:18:18,448
boys and girls are brought
together in the class room.

223
00:18:19,055 --> 00:18:22,917
And they meet quite naturally in the
cinema queue on Saturday morning.

224
00:18:44,677 --> 00:18:47,335
Sometime on Saturday
mornings I go to the cinema

225
00:18:48,412 --> 00:18:51,271
Sometime with my friends
and sometimes with him.

226
00:18:52,306 --> 00:18:53,774
You don't!
- I do!

227
00:18:53,975 --> 00:18:55,695
she doesn't

228
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:58,461
I don't always
see you

229
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:02,932
you go to a
different cinema

230
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:07,064
last week i went to
the.....where you go

231
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:08,780
yeah but i
didn't go

232
00:19:10,606 --> 00:19:13,606
How much does mixing or
segregating the sexes matter?

233
00:19:14,292 --> 00:19:17,842
What effect does it have on what
boys and girls think about each other?

234
00:19:18,483 --> 00:19:20,869
will it influence their chances
of love and marriage?

235
00:19:21,635 --> 00:19:24,281
We asked the children what they
thought about the opposite sex.

236
00:19:25,578 --> 00:19:27,338
Tell me do you
have any girlfriends?

237
00:19:27,941 --> 00:19:29,227
Well...
not many.

238
00:19:29,914 --> 00:19:30,901
What do you think
about girls?

239
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,019
well not much.

240
00:19:33,585 --> 00:19:34,867
I don't think
much of girls.

241
00:19:35,512 --> 00:19:37,129
Touch a boy,
kiss a boy.

242
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:39,833
Sometimes we get
our own back and say...

243
00:19:40,035 --> 00:19:41,652
catch a girl
and kiss a girl.

244
00:19:42,302 --> 00:19:43,042
Yeah

245
00:19:43,691 --> 00:19:44,568
And what
was that?

246
00:19:44,988 --> 00:19:48,196
The girls are always screaming.
-Yeah

247
00:19:48,568 --> 00:19:50,004
When we
catch them,

248
00:19:50,879 --> 00:19:52,605
we kiss them,
-Yes.

249
00:19:52,882 --> 00:19:56,599
And when its catch a boy, kiss a boy
when the girls catch us, they kiss us..

250
00:19:57,199 --> 00:19:58,620
they say 'aaaaah'...
-Yeah.

251
00:19:58,937 --> 00:20:00,203
but much
louder though.

252
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:03,477
If we did...
all love Jeffrey

253
00:20:03,823 --> 00:20:05,514
we all want to marry.
- Yeah.

254
00:20:05,778 --> 00:20:10,823
I think I know the one that
he likes best and that's her.

255
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:13,307
Susan most of
all likes Lesley

256
00:20:13,854 --> 00:20:15,854
She told me before.
-Do I?

257
00:20:15,854 --> 00:20:19,691
You said, she keeps
changing her mind though

258
00:20:19,691 --> 00:20:21,481
Yeah! I don't know
which one really

259
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:26,438
Well, my girlfriend
is in Africa...

260
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,336
and  I don't think I have another
chance of seeing her again...

261
00:20:31,229 --> 00:20:36,353
and there were two in Switzerland which
I liked too in a hotel, Park Hotel.

262
00:20:37,726 --> 00:20:39,581
Well, I know
he is hers...

263
00:20:40,144 --> 00:20:41,444
He loves her.

264
00:20:41,902 --> 00:20:43,530
I don't,
I love him.

265
00:20:45,683 --> 00:20:46,629
And these two...

266
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,297
I love you, I
love Christopher

267
00:20:49,158 --> 00:20:52,150
See, he loves Suzan
because Suzan loves him.

268
00:20:52,857 --> 00:20:55,768
He loves Lindsay and Lindsay loves him.
-I don't love him

269
00:20:56,104 --> 00:20:59,083
once Caroline
Tetford said

270
00:20:59,481 --> 00:21:03,482
She loved me.
-And what happened after that?

271
00:21:03,935 --> 00:21:07,096
And I am going to marry...
I marry her when I grow up.

272
00:21:07,727 --> 00:21:11,277
I hate her. She's always getting
bad tempered and cross with me.

273
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,213
Is she?

274
00:21:12,213 --> 00:21:18,566
Yes! Neil Hughes! Move your desk forward
and sometimes... and sometimes...

275
00:21:19,852 --> 00:21:23,923
when...when she is supposed to have
the chair on the back of the desk...

276
00:21:23,923 --> 00:21:27,176
and when I take it...
when I put it back...

277
00:21:27,176 --> 00:21:29,650
she says, 'Neil Hughes!' take
your chair forward.

278
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:33,043
And she just gets into a girly
cross with me like that.

279
00:21:33,523 --> 00:21:35,914
I'd like to get
married when I grow up.

280
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:40,790
But I don't know what sort of
boy but I think one...

281
00:21:45,681 --> 00:21:48,383
thats not got
lot of money but is...

282
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:52,058
has got some money.
Not a lot though!

283
00:21:52,553 --> 00:21:54,982
Would you like
to get married Paul?

284
00:21:54,982 --> 00:21:56,988
Tell me
why not!

285
00:21:59,009 --> 00:22:03,847
I don't like it. Say... say
you had a wife...

286
00:22:04,862 --> 00:22:09,124
Say... say you have to eat
what they cooked you

287
00:22:10,198 --> 00:22:13,170
And say I don't
like greens well I don't...

288
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:20,282
And say... she says you have to eat
what you're given... so...

289
00:22:20,845 --> 00:22:25,500
I don't like greens so if she gives
me greens then... then that's it

290
00:22:25,959 --> 00:22:29,107
When I get married I don't
want to have any children...

291
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:33,828
Because they are always
doing naughty things and...

292
00:22:34,307 --> 00:22:36,200
making the
whole house untidy.

293
00:22:36,683 --> 00:22:39,603
When I get married I will
like to have two children.

294
00:22:40,653 --> 00:22:44,244
You'll have Nanny to look after
but you won't look after them?

295
00:22:48,986 --> 00:22:51,561
No I want a
Nanny to look after them.

296
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:57,061
If I could I would have two girls
and two boys.  -Yes so would I

297
00:22:57,519 --> 00:22:58,718
And what about
you Jackie?

298
00:22:59,243 --> 00:23:02,608
My Mom because she got five
girls she had seven years bad luck

299
00:23:03,169 --> 00:23:06,461
and seven years is a bad luck
thats why she has got five girls.

300
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:11,595
And so... when my baby was
supposed to be born...

301
00:23:12,485 --> 00:23:14,382
and we all wished
 it was a boy but...

302
00:23:14,736 --> 00:23:17,799
But we were all waiting in my nans
for my dad 'cause he visited her

303
00:23:18,807 --> 00:23:21,920
he came home and said
"it's another girl kids"

304
00:23:22,196 --> 00:23:24,170
we all said "awwwww!"

305
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:26,686
What do you think about 
girl friends at your age?

306
00:23:27,787 --> 00:23:30,362
 I've got one but I 
don't think much of her.

307
00:23:31,266 --> 00:23:34,851
No but I said that when
boys go around with girls...

308
00:23:35,201 --> 00:23:37,422
they don't pay attention
to what they're doing.

309
00:23:37,858 --> 00:23:39,954
My Grand mother had
 an accident because...

310
00:23:40,343 --> 00:23:44,235
a boy friend was kissing... his
girl friend in the street.

311
00:23:44,944 --> 00:23:49,526
The girls never... never... never
do what the boys want them.

312
00:23:49,942 --> 00:23:52,378
They always start 
playing with dolls...

313
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:56,404
when boys want to play rough and tumble.
-It's not true!

314
00:23:56,989 --> 00:24:01,494
They're rather boring you never get a
chance to play with them and things like

315
00:24:01,704 --> 00:24:02,580
rough and tumble...

316
00:24:02,781 --> 00:24:05,484
And they always start
 playing with their dolls.

317
00:24:06,032 --> 00:24:08,795
Yes... as soon as you start...
-and silly things like that...

318
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,747
Only intelligent girls start playing with 
you -and they always take you away...

319
00:24:13,747 --> 00:24:16,808
from whatever game
 you are playing yourself.

320
00:24:16,808 --> 00:24:20,232
Yes! They say `I don't want to
play that game with you...'

321
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,296
and they don't stop crying.
- Yes!

322
00:24:22,546 --> 00:24:23,778
Do you have a girl friend?

323
00:24:28,464 --> 00:24:30,583
I don't want to answer that.

324
00:24:31,101 --> 00:24:35,121
I don't want to answer 
those kinds of questions.

325
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:38,084
They Love.
-That's right!

326
00:24:38,365 --> 00:24:39,709
Back to love, 'amo'.

327
00:24:40,067 --> 00:24:43,409
Now let's have the 
present tense of 'amo'.

328
00:24:43,409 --> 00:24:44,998
Amos, amas, amant...

329
00:24:45,372 --> 00:24:46,905
anamus, amatis, amant.

330
00:24:47,184 --> 00:24:50,943
Yes, What's the last one?

331
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:53,934
Amant!
-Amant.

332
00:24:54,524 --> 00:24:56,377
Fill up the gaps on
 the board there

333
00:24:56,614 --> 00:24:57,970
Have a little chalk?
-Yeah

334
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:02,809
In your best writing please. All right!

335
00:25:09,447 --> 00:25:14,929
What's Major... what's
 'amatis' mean?

336
00:25:17,731 --> 00:25:18,594
We love.

337
00:25:19,624 --> 00:25:23,251
No, Holden. Amatis?

338
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:26,541
You love.
-You love! Second person, isn't it?

339
00:25:27,263 --> 00:25:27,761
Yes sir.

340
00:25:28,265 --> 00:25:30,333
That was silly wasn't it

341
00:25:31,415 --> 00:25:36,640
Now then Russell, let's hear
the present tense of 'porto'.

342
00:25:37,557 --> 00:25:39,587
Porto, portas, portat,

343
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:43,587
portamus, portatis, portant.
-That's right!

344
00:25:44,124 --> 00:25:47,182
Holden, let's hear the
present tense of 'evasto'.

345
00:25:47,986 --> 00:25:52,392
Evasto, evastas... evastat,

346
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:56,026
evastamus, evastatis. evastant.

347
00:25:56,543 --> 00:25:57,387
Yes, speak up.

348
00:25:57,636 --> 00:26:00,012
Now let's... what does `evasto' mean?

349
00:26:02,418 --> 00:26:03,391
I...

350
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,251
All right, let's...

351
00:26:08,008 --> 00:26:09,538
Well, got it?
- Lay waste.

352
00:26:09,538 --> 00:26:11,971
`Evasto'- to lay waste!

353
00:26:46,088 --> 00:26:46,838
All right.

354
00:26:48,466 --> 00:26:49,996
All right you can talk again.

355
00:27:04,893 --> 00:27:09,760
Are the children themselves aware of
differences between rich and poor?

356
00:27:10,409 --> 00:27:12,823
have they learned prejudice.

357
00:27:13,316 --> 00:27:15,939
What do they think about money?

358
00:27:16,651 --> 00:27:19,366
I think it's not a bad idea
to pay for schools...

359
00:27:19,784 --> 00:27:20,847
becasue if we didn't...

360
00:27:21,534 --> 00:27:23,972
schools would be so
nasty and crowded.

361
00:27:24,845 --> 00:27:26,443
Yes.
-So do I think so.

362
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,100
Yes!

363
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:31,899
And... people in the schools wouldn't
-And poor people would come rushing in

364
00:27:32,293 --> 00:27:34,728
The man, in charge of the school...

365
00:27:35,178 --> 00:27:37,984
would get very angry
because he would...

366
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,951
And he would get bankrupt.
-because he wouldn't...

367
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:44,626
He wouldn't be able to pay all the
masters if he didn't get any money.

368
00:27:44,965 --> 00:27:47,690
Yes. I think he would get
bankrupt because paying all the...

369
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:49,333
What does bankrupt mean?

370
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:51,280
Having no more money
and go to prison

371
00:27:52,096 --> 00:27:53,981
Why do you have to go
 to prison? That's strong!

372
00:27:54,348 --> 00:27:57,967
Becasue that obviously means
you've been spending it too much.

373
00:27:58,485 --> 00:28:00,392
I've got twenty three three penny pieces...

374
00:28:00,873 --> 00:28:04,852
and I don't know how many
half penny pieces I've got now

375
00:28:05,336 --> 00:28:07,467
I read The Financial Times.

376
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:10,700
I read Observer and The Times.

377
00:28:11,158 --> 00:28:12,671
What do you like about it?

378
00:28:13,216 --> 00:28:14,308
Well, I like...

379
00:28:14,546 --> 00:28:16,951
I usually look at the
headlines then read...

380
00:28:17,803 --> 00:28:20,698
about them... about it.

381
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:25,710
I like my newspaper because I
got shares in it

382
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:30,181
and I know everyday what shares are
-The stuff misers like you like

383
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:30,941
No. But...

384
00:28:30,941 --> 00:28:34,934
on Mondays they don't
move up so I don't look at it.

385
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:39,552
What would you do if you have lots
of money, about say... two pounds?

386
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,328
Me?

387
00:28:41,076 --> 00:28:42,702
I would help the poor.

388
00:28:43,071 --> 00:28:47,319
Yeah because the poor if you
don't help them they would die

389
00:28:47,735 --> 00:28:48,897
Wouldn't they?

390
00:28:49,662 --> 00:28:53,622
And everytime we've a harvest
festival, we send them food.

391
00:28:54,071 --> 00:29:01,484
Once these two, no Susan and Janet 
went round giving food out

392
00:29:01,726 --> 00:29:03,960
What do you think about rich people?

393
00:29:04,523 --> 00:29:07,420
Well... not much.

394
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:09,655
Tell me about them

395
00:29:09,882 --> 00:29:11,661
Well, they think they
can do everything...

396
00:29:11,661 --> 00:29:15,716
without you doing it as well and
they think just because they're rich...

397
00:29:15,716 --> 00:29:17,907
and they have to have people

398
00:29:18,748 --> 00:29:21,719
like they have to do
all their work and stuff.

399
00:29:22,203 --> 00:29:23,724
I don't think much of the accents.

400
00:29:24,226 --> 00:29:26,383
Neither do I.
-Neither do I.

401
00:29:26,618 --> 00:29:29,456
That doesn't prevent me liking them.

402
00:29:29,456 --> 00:29:33,007
Poor children, they boast 
about themselves. - No they don't.

403
00:29:33,352 --> 00:29:38,450
Rich children boast about themselves and
say how clever I am and things like that

404
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:42,935
Yes, and rich children always
make fun of poor children, I hate.

405
00:29:43,161 --> 00:29:48,237
Yes. -Yes they say, look at that lovely
little sissy and they laugh at them.

406
00:29:48,237 --> 00:29:49,903
Yes, and they throw things at them.

407
00:29:49,903 --> 00:29:50,844
Yes.

408
00:29:50,844 --> 00:29:52,921
And poor child gets scared to death.

409
00:29:53,238 --> 00:29:53,988
The posh ones

410
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:56,677
Oh Yes. Oh yes. Oh Yes.

411
00:29:57,773 --> 00:29:59,259
They're nuts!

412
00:29:59,945 --> 00:30:01,076
you just have to touch them

413
00:30:01,493 --> 00:30:06,001
Jacqueline, what do you
think about coloured people?

414
00:30:06,354 --> 00:30:11,986
You said to me once that you like them
but what do you really think about them?

415
00:30:11,986 --> 00:30:15,941
Well, they're nice and its
as same as us really...

416
00:30:15,941 --> 00:30:17,570
but one thing...

417
00:30:18,167 --> 00:30:22,097
it's only because their skin is
brown and we're white...

418
00:30:22,305 --> 00:30:23,650
sort of pinkish we're.

419
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,410
Some people from Africa come here...

420
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:31,515
but when they go, they
put their clothes on

421
00:30:31,876 --> 00:30:36,664
I've only seen them on
television and places like that.

422
00:30:36,915 --> 00:30:39,957
I don't... I don't know
anybody who is coloured.

423
00:30:41,587 --> 00:30:46,114
I don't want to know anybody who is
coloured. Thank you very much!

424
00:30:46,352 --> 00:30:49,563
Coloured people. I don't 
like them very much.

425
00:30:50,151 --> 00:30:53,864
No... it sounds like 
ghostly coloured people.

426
00:30:53,864 --> 00:30:56,383
Do you think of a purple person...

427
00:30:56,383 --> 00:30:57,616
with red eyes,

428
00:30:57,896 --> 00:30:58,759
yellow feet and...

429
00:30:59,056 --> 00:31:03,751
I can't really think of
what they really look like.

430
00:31:04,174 --> 00:31:06,615
They are just same as me, aren't they?

431
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,952
What do they think 
about each other?

432
00:31:22,952 --> 00:31:24,949
And how'll they act together?

433
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,970
To find out, we invited
them all to one big party...

434
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,670
and joined in

435
00:32:14,413 --> 00:32:17,333
Tell me what did you
 three think about...

436
00:32:17,536 --> 00:32:19,518
the other children 
that you met today...

437
00:32:19,518 --> 00:32:21,346
and all that, there were
quite varieties?

438
00:32:21,554 --> 00:32:24,881
Yes but they were bit
too tough for my liking.

439
00:32:25,288 --> 00:32:28,903
Some hit me right in the back and
I 've still got some pain there.

440
00:32:29,307 --> 00:32:33,943
And well, some of them
were rather dirty.

441
00:32:34,636 --> 00:32:38,518
what did you think about them?
-I played with them quiet naturally.

442
00:32:38,939 --> 00:32:41,420
I think they were rather nice, really.

443
00:32:41,905 --> 00:32:43,224
I don't like the boys.

444
00:32:43,694 --> 00:32:47,648
Those three,  I don't like all of them. None of them.

445
00:32:47,648 --> 00:32:48,738
What about the girls?

446
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:51,414
Yeah, I liked that girl...

447
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,172
but not the boys.

448
00:32:55,172 --> 00:32:55,974
Why?

449
00:32:56,691 --> 00:33:02,705
Because once I pulled his scarf he said,
'Don't you pull my scarf' and I hate him

450
00:33:02,705 --> 00:33:04,925
And when we were at that park...

451
00:33:04,925 --> 00:33:07,443
he went round punching everybody.

452
00:33:09,217 --> 00:33:12,207
If some of our children didn't
get on with each other...

453
00:33:12,483 --> 00:33:14,336
does it really matter?

454
00:33:14,564 --> 00:33:15,343
After all...

455
00:33:15,343 --> 00:33:17,507
they're not likely to meet
in the same class room.

456
00:33:18,858 --> 00:33:20,171
At the Kensington school...

457
00:33:20,483 --> 00:33:24,528
all the boys are being prepared for
public school places and universities...

458
00:33:26,313 --> 00:33:29,556
whereas of these thirty children
getting their milk from Tony.

459
00:33:29,985 --> 00:33:33,479
Only, three are likely to win a
place at a grammer school.

460
00:33:34,175 --> 00:33:36,758
Indeed, the vast 
majority will leave school...

461
00:33:37,376 --> 00:33:39,752
and start work at fifteen.

462
00:33:50,148 --> 00:33:52,837
What plans do the 
children themselves have?

463
00:33:53,372 --> 00:33:58,657
When I leave the school, I'm
going to College Court...

464
00:34:01,181 --> 00:34:05,904
and then I would be going to Westminster
Boarding School if I pass the exam.

465
00:34:06,806 --> 00:34:12,112
Then we think, I am going
to Cambridge and Trinity Hall.

466
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,459
What does university mean?

467
00:34:16,337 --> 00:34:17,186
Well...

468
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:21,598
before I'm old enough to get a job

469
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:26,449
I'll just walk around
and see what I can find.

470
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:32,597
When I leave the school, I go
to Broadstairs, St. Peter's Court.

471
00:34:32,844 --> 00:34:36,960
And after that I'm
going to Charter House.

472
00:34:37,646 --> 00:34:43,411
And after that Trinity Hall, Cambridge.

473
00:34:43,862 --> 00:34:46,006
I like to be like Kathy Kirby

474
00:34:46,303 --> 00:34:50,000
I want to be a jockey when I grow up. Ya
I want to be a jockey when I grow up.

475
00:34:50,627 --> 00:34:51,843
When I leave school...

476
00:34:52,296 --> 00:34:54,547
I'm going to the Dragon School...

477
00:34:54,923 --> 00:34:55,825
I might.

478
00:34:57,543 --> 00:35:01,963
I might go to Charles
House, Marlborough

479
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:03,630
And...

480
00:35:06,364 --> 00:35:10,600
I can't.... remember 
all other places...

481
00:35:11,052 --> 00:35:14,499
because mummy has got so many
places... and those're some of them.

482
00:35:14,715 --> 00:35:16,309
What about university Charles?

483
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:18,585
I might go to Oxford.

484
00:35:19,474 --> 00:35:20,247
Well...

485
00:35:21,474 --> 00:35:25,349
I don't think I need to go to university
'cause  I'm not gonna be a teacher.

486
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:29,697
I don't think you want to go to 
university if you want to be an astronaut

487
00:35:30,163 --> 00:35:32,757
When I grow up, I want
to be an astronaut but...

488
00:35:33,027 --> 00:35:37,281
if I can't be an astonaut
I think I'll be a coach driver.

489
00:35:37,508 --> 00:35:39,117
Tell me about the coach driver.

490
00:35:39,117 --> 00:35:41,194
Well, I'm going to take
 people to the country...

491
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:44,252
and sometimes take them 
to the sea-side and...

492
00:35:45,507 --> 00:35:50,349
And I'll have a big loud speaker on the
coach and tell them where about we're...

493
00:35:50,664 --> 00:35:52,381
and what we're going to do.

494
00:35:53,356 --> 00:35:54,961
And what's the name of the road is.

495
00:35:55,758 --> 00:35:57,015
All about that.

496
00:35:57,492 --> 00:35:59,919
When... if I can't be an astonaut
I would like to be a...

497
00:36:01,101 --> 00:36:03,573
a bridal sergeant
 in the police force...

498
00:36:03,873 --> 00:36:04,916
like my dad is.

499
00:36:05,217 --> 00:36:06,765
I was gonna be a policeman but...

500
00:36:07,341 --> 00:36:10,736
how thought how hard
it would be to join in.

501
00:36:11,292 --> 00:36:12,586
When I leave the school,

502
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,381
I'm down for Heathfield and
Southfield Manor and then maybe,

503
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:21,736
I may want to go to a university...

504
00:36:21,938 --> 00:36:23,345
but I don't know which one yet.

505
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:27,575
I'll buy myself a nice new
made house you know.

506
00:36:28,256 --> 00:36:30,731
one that's all
nice and comfy.

507
00:36:31,351 --> 00:36:33,307
I am going to work in Woolworths

508
00:36:33,853 --> 00:36:39,869
When I grow up I like to find out
all about the moon and all that.

509
00:36:40,196 --> 00:36:42,242
Well, going to Africa...

510
00:36:42,983 --> 00:36:44,993
and try and teach people...

511
00:36:45,326 --> 00:36:47,481
who are not civilized...

512
00:36:47,726 --> 00:36:50,777
to be more or less good.

513
00:37:01,733 --> 00:37:04,629
At the end of their very
special day in London...

514
00:37:04,867 --> 00:37:07,388
after their trip to the
zoo and the party...

515
00:37:07,929 --> 00:37:10,968
we took our children to
an adventure play ground...

516
00:37:10,968 --> 00:37:13,827
where they could do
just what they like.

517
00:37:15,603 --> 00:37:19,798
There's from a children's home
set about building a house.

518
00:37:34,834 --> 00:37:36,593
That's Nicholas.

519
00:37:37,973 --> 00:37:39,876
And Tony.

520
00:38:06,197 --> 00:38:07,997
Andrew.

521
00:38:08,216 --> 00:38:09,934
And Bruce.

522
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,957
John.

523
00:38:25,664 --> 00:38:27,418
Suzie.

524
00:38:29,314 --> 00:38:30,828
Jackie and her friends.

525
00:38:37,592 --> 00:38:39,730
Give me a child until he is seven...

526
00:38:39,974 --> 00:38:41,734
and I will give you the man.

527
00:38:50,943 --> 00:38:54,393
This has been a glimpse
 of Britain's future.
