Help me!

5

Help me!

6
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:22,722
(Brennan)
Hodgins?!

7
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:26,860
Help me!

8
00:00:28,963 --> 00:00:30,730
Hodgins!

9
00:00:30,765 --> 00:00:33,166
Dr. Brennan!
(Gasps)

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,400
Hodgins!
Dr. Brennan, help me!

11
00:00:34,435 --> 00:00:35,769
Hodgins!

12
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:40,739
Hodgins!

13
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:47,179
Booth (Echoing, distorted):
Bones... Bones... Bones!

14
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,847
Bones!

15
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:49,949
Booth!
God!

16
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:52,451
Booth!

17
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:54,652
Stay with me.

18
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:55,787

33

(Newscaster)
<i>The gravedigger case</i>

36
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,845
finally begins today with an
evidentiary hearing.

37
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:59,980
The defendant, prominent federal
prosecutor Heather Taffet,

38
00:02:00,015 --> 00:02:02,716
will be defending herself
against multiple charges

39
00:02:02,751 --> 00:02:04,985
of kidnapping and murder.

40
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,689
One charge involves ten-year-old
Terrence Gilroy,

41
00:02:08,723 --> 00:02:10,324
who has never been found.

42
00:02:10,359 --> 00:02:13,393
Testimony is expected
from three kidnapping victims:

43
00:02:13,427 --> 00:02:16,196
Seely Booth,
an Agent with the FBI,

44
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,231
as well as scientist
Jack Hodgins

45
00:02:18,266 --> 00:02:21,168
and Temperance Brennan
of the Jeffers...

46
00:02:24,872 --> 00:02:27,207
(Booth)
<i>You okay, Bones?</i>

47
00:02:27,241 --> 00:02:28,708
Of course.
Why wouldn't I be?

48
00:02:28,742 --> 00:02:30,442
Well, we're about
to come head to head

49
00:02:30,477 --> 00:02:32,378
with the woman who
tried to kill both of us.

50
00:02:32,412 --> 00:02:33,679
So are you.
Aren't you okay?

51
00:02:33,713 --> 00:02:35,381
Sure. Yeah. You know,
I'm just checkin' in.

52
00:02:35,415 --> 00:02:37,082
I just want to make sure
you're okay

53
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:38,384
and if you need
anything, I...

54
00:02:38,418 --> 00:02:39,918
It's just
another case, Booth.

55
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:40,986
Right.
Dad!

56
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,388
(Booth)
Max?

57
00:02:42,422 --> 00:02:43,622
What, what are you doing here?

58
00:02:43,657 --> 00:02:45,157
I just thought you should have
a little support

59
00:02:45,191 --> 00:02:47,592
from somebody who's been through
the legal system a few times.

60
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:49,860
Why is everyone treating me
like a child?

61
00:02:49,895 --> 00:02:51,196
Because I don't want you

62
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,998
to get your hopes up.
This is far from a slam dunk.

63
00:02:54,032 --> 00:02:56,033
(Booth)
That's exactly why
Caroline is here, all right?

64
00:02:56,068 --> 00:02:58,035
We have five cases,
multiple counts:

65
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,205
Bones, Hodgins,
the ten-year-old boy...

66
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,239
whose body has never been found.

67
00:03:02,273 --> 00:03:04,541
Your prosecutor's getting
desperate.

68
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,109
Max, she knows
what she's doing, okay?

69
00:03:06,143 --> 00:03:08,478
I thought you were here
for support, dad.

70
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,659
Okay, you all ready
to play nice?

71
00:03:23,694 --> 00:03:24,694
Always, your honor.

72
00:03:24,728 --> 00:03:25,894
Your honor, since
I'm representing

73
00:03:25,929 --> 00:03:27,230
myself, I'd like to request

74
00:03:27,264 --> 00:03:29,098
that my shackles be removed
while I'm in court.

75
00:03:29,132 --> 00:03:30,099
This is only

76
00:03:30,133 --> 00:03:31,701
an evidentiary hearing,
your honor.

77
00:03:31,735 --> 00:03:33,135
There's no jury to prejudice.

78
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:34,536
And frankly,
I feel a bit

79
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,238
more secure
with her in chains.

80
00:03:36,272 --> 00:03:38,707
Spare us the dramatic
flourishes, Ms. Julian.

81
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:39,941
When we go to trial,

82
00:03:39,975 --> 00:03:42,477
we can revisit the request,
Ms. Taffet.

83
00:03:42,511 --> 00:03:43,712
First witness.

84
00:03:43,746 --> 00:03:47,014
Burn marks were found
on the victims that were

85
00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:48,916
consistent with injuries
one would sustain

86
00:03:48,951 --> 00:03:50,784
from a three-million volt
stun gun.

87
00:03:50,818 --> 00:03:53,687
(Booth)
The stun gun was found
in the suspect's storage locker.

88
00:03:53,722 --> 00:03:55,889
It matches the stun gun
that was used

89
00:03:55,923 --> 00:03:58,259
in the attack on me,
as well as...

90
00:03:58,293 --> 00:04:00,694
The suspect's steel-toed boots
were also found

91
00:04:00,729 --> 00:04:01,895
in the storage locker.

92
00:04:01,929 --> 00:04:04,064
This storage locker was found

93
00:04:04,098 --> 00:04:06,532
with information obtained
illegally, wasn't it?

94
00:04:06,567 --> 00:04:09,135
(Saroyan)
We didn't know that at the time,
your honor.

95
00:04:09,169 --> 00:04:12,004
We obtained a legal warrant
to search the locker.

96
00:04:12,038 --> 00:04:14,274
The fact that Agent Booth's
brother gave you the lead

97
00:04:14,308 --> 00:04:15,575
didn't make you suspicious?

98
00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:17,877
He was an officer assigned
to homeland security.

99
00:04:17,911 --> 00:04:20,846
We had no reason to question
the information he provided.

100
00:04:20,881 --> 00:04:22,247
The warrant was obtained
without malice.

101
00:04:22,282 --> 00:04:23,782
(Taffet)
That's irrelevant,
your honor.

102
00:04:23,816 --> 00:04:26,518
Everything found in that storage locker
should be dismissed.

103
00:04:26,552 --> 00:04:29,020
I submit that a warrant wasn't
even necessary.

104
00:04:29,054 --> 00:04:31,256
Under precedent
of imminent danger,

105
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:33,792
law authority had the duty
to enter that storage locker

106
00:04:33,826 --> 00:04:35,193
without a valid warrant.

107
00:04:35,227 --> 00:04:36,861
Agent Booth's life was
in danger.

108
00:04:36,896 --> 00:04:38,228
Imminent danger
applies

109
00:04:38,263 --> 00:04:41,632
only if law enforcement hears
a violent threat

110
00:04:41,667 --> 00:04:43,033
or struggle
at the scene.

111
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:44,201
(Judge)
I'm sorry, Ms. Julian,

112
00:04:44,235 --> 00:04:46,704
but no matter how pure
the intention,

113
00:04:46,738 --> 00:04:48,706
the warrant was obtained
illegally.

114
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,374
Therefore, any and all evidence
gathered

115
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:52,943
during the search and seizure
is inadmissible.

116
00:04:52,977 --> 00:04:54,210
(Taffet) Thank you,
your honor.

117
00:04:54,244 --> 00:04:55,978
(Judge) This was not a personal
favor, Ms. Taffet.

118
00:04:56,013 --> 00:04:57,781
I am restrained by the law.

119
00:04:57,815 --> 00:04:59,683
I'd like to move that all
charges be dropped, your honor.

120
00:04:59,717 --> 00:05:00,850
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

121
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:03,687
We still have dirt samples
from the crime scene,

122
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:05,288
the ransom tapes...
Your honor,

123
00:05:05,323 --> 00:05:06,690
this is a waste
of the court's time

124
00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:08,425
and the taxpayers' money.

125
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:11,393
If I lose, I'll send everyone
a note of apology.

126
00:05:11,428 --> 00:05:14,730
You aren't left with much,
Ms. Julian.

127
00:05:14,764 --> 00:05:16,965
Are you sure you want
to proceed?

128
00:05:16,999 --> 00:05:18,334
(Sighs)

129
00:05:33,081 --> 00:05:34,515
Yes, your honor.

130
00:05:36,084 --> 00:05:38,453
Okay. The charges stand.

131
00:05:38,487 --> 00:05:39,654
We're going to trial.

132
00:05:39,688 --> 00:05:40,688
Court is adjourned.

133
00:05:40,723 --> 00:05:42,689

(Shackles jangling)

135
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:47,026
If you're so brilliant,
Dr. Brennan,

136
00:05:47,061 --> 00:05:48,194
why couldn't you
find something

137
00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:50,063
as simple as the number?
Let's go, come on.

138
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,901
You all right?
What'd she say to you?

139
00:05:54,935 --> 00:05:57,103
She says I missed some evidence.

140
00:05:57,137 --> 00:05:58,003
Evidence?

141
00:05:58,037 --> 00:06:00,205
She doesn't think I can find it.

(computer trilling)

145
00:06:39,637 --> 00:06:41,871
Booth is getting
her arrest records, as well as

146
00:06:41,872 --> 00:06:43,739
old case files from when
she was a prosecutor.

147
00:06:43,774 --> 00:06:47,077
Okay, uh, I'm pulling every
record we have so far

148
00:06:47,111 --> 00:06:49,446
associated with Taffet
social security numbers,

149
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,081
birth dates,
blood test results.

150
00:06:51,115 --> 00:06:52,315
Ages of the victims?

151
00:06:52,349 --> 00:06:54,317
Got those.
I'm using

152
00:06:54,351 --> 00:06:55,785
a recursive search algorithm

153
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:58,920
which analyzes
and cross-references the data.

154
00:06:58,955 --> 00:06:59,988
Since they're related,

155
00:07:00,022 --> 00:07:02,157
any inconsistencies can raise
a red flag.

156
00:07:02,192 --> 00:07:04,093
I think Taffet is
just messing with us again.

157
00:07:04,127 --> 00:07:06,027
(Sweets) No, I have
to disagree. I mean,

158
00:07:06,062 --> 00:07:07,028
her pathology is
consistent;

159
00:07:07,063 --> 00:07:08,697
this is all
a game to her.

160
00:07:08,731 --> 00:07:10,899
She won the first round,
so now she's upping the stakes

161
00:07:10,933 --> 00:07:12,534
by challenging Dr. Brennan.

162
00:07:12,569 --> 00:07:14,735
Yeah, or maybe she knows there's
something in the soil samples

163
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:16,904
we already have, so she's
just trying to distract us.

164
00:07:16,938 --> 00:07:19,073
You analyzed those soil samples
a hundred times.

165
00:07:19,108 --> 00:07:20,641
Are you telling me
to give up, Sweets?

166
00:07:20,675 --> 00:07:21,775
No, of course not.

167
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:22,977
But I mean,
I understand

168
00:07:23,011 --> 00:07:25,045
the need to cling to anything...
"Cling"?

169
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,647
Okay, so I'm crazy now.

170
00:07:26,681 --> 00:07:27,415
That's not what I meant.

171
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:28,516
Go, Dr. Hodgins.

172
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,916
Look at the soil again.

173
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,251
You might find something.

174
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:40,393
You know,
he still gets nightmares.

175
00:07:40,428 --> 00:07:41,828
Says he wakes up
in a sweat.

176
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:43,296
(Sweets)
I should have been
more sensitive.

177
00:07:43,331 --> 00:07:44,731
This must be difficult
for you, too.

178
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:45,831
If you need any...

179
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:47,199
I'm fine.
What about the weight

180
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:49,368
and size
of the victim's remains?

181
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,870
Yeah, it's a good idea.
I'll check it out.

182
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:53,572
(Clears throat)

183
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:04,482
Here are the first set
of documents you asked for.

184
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:07,051
More numbers than I've ever seen
in my life.

185
00:08:07,085 --> 00:08:08,353
Right. Thanks. You okay?

186
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:09,587
Oh, you mean because

187
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:10,955
this case is a career killer?

188
00:08:10,989 --> 00:08:12,690
I'm cute.
I can always find a job.

189
00:08:12,724 --> 00:08:13,658
Come on. Look, they're gonna
come up with something.

190
00:08:13,692 --> 00:08:14,725
They always do, right?

191
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,927
Do you really believe that,
<i>cherie?</i>

192
00:08:16,962 --> 00:08:18,562
Well, they saved my life,
remember?

193
00:08:18,596 --> 00:08:19,563
And that was impossible.

194
00:08:19,597 --> 00:08:22,533
I'll give you that one.

195
00:08:22,567 --> 00:08:24,100
So, how's your girlfriend
holding up?

196
00:08:24,135 --> 00:08:25,469
She's fine.

197
00:08:25,503 --> 00:08:27,271
She's not my girlfriend.

198
00:08:27,305 --> 00:08:29,806
Oh, so those little looks
between you...?

199
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,375
Nothing.

200
00:08:31,409 --> 00:08:32,643
Right.

201
00:08:32,677 --> 00:08:34,777
I hope you're more believable
on the stand.

202
00:08:34,811 --> 00:08:36,579
Have Angela run
these numbers

203
00:08:36,613 --> 00:08:38,080
as quickly as she can.

204
00:08:38,114 --> 00:08:41,484
The judge isn't gonna give me
more than a day.

205
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,954
(Gravedigger distorted)
if I don't receive the money
in the numbered account

206
00:08:45,989 --> 00:08:48,991
within eight hours,
your child will die.

207
00:08:49,025 --> 00:08:52,360
This is the last time
you will hear from me.

208
00:08:52,395 --> 00:08:54,996
There will be no further
communications.

209
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,130
What happened to the numbers?

210
00:08:56,165 --> 00:08:58,600
Well, I came up dry.

211
00:08:58,634 --> 00:09:00,302
Brennan and Booth are compiling
another set.

212
00:09:00,336 --> 00:09:01,903
But until then, I'm trying

213
00:09:01,937 --> 00:09:03,771
to drag Taffet's voice
from these ransom tapes.

214
00:09:03,806 --> 00:09:04,939
Well, any luck?

215
00:09:04,973 --> 00:09:07,208
She used a variable band
inversion, so the wave is

216
00:09:07,242 --> 00:09:11,178
broken up into hundreds of small
sections, each section scrambled

217
00:09:11,213 --> 00:09:12,179
with different frequency
sequencing.

218
00:09:12,214 --> 00:09:13,314
You didn't ask me

219
00:09:13,348 --> 00:09:15,182
if I found anything new
in the soil samples.

220
00:09:15,217 --> 00:09:16,183
Did you?

221
00:09:16,218 --> 00:09:17,351
No, of course not.

222
00:09:17,385 --> 00:09:19,620
I mean, Sweets was right.
You knew that.

223
00:09:23,224 --> 00:09:25,958
I'm barely keeping it together
here, Ang.

224
00:09:29,663 --> 00:09:30,763
Well, you were, uh,

225
00:09:30,797 --> 00:09:33,266
you were sane enough
to marry me.

226
00:09:35,736 --> 00:09:37,236
But I don't feel
strong enough

227
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,037
to tell anybody yet.

228
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:42,274
I feel like she's still got me
locked up, you know?

229
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:47,312
I mean, when I see her,
there's just this, um,

230
00:09:47,347 --> 00:09:50,014
anger, I mean, this kind
of helplessness that...

231
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:51,717
I know, I know.

232
00:09:51,751 --> 00:09:54,118
When I was buried
in that car,

233
00:09:54,152 --> 00:09:57,355
I didn't think I was ever gonna
see you again.

234
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,290
And now I feel

235
00:09:59,324 --> 00:10:01,158
like she's still in between us.

236
00:10:01,192 --> 00:10:04,061
Well, she's not.

237
00:10:04,095 --> 00:10:05,596
Look at me.

238
00:10:05,631 --> 00:10:08,098
She's not.

239
00:10:08,133 --> 00:10:11,801
Nobody can get between us.

240
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,175
(Murmurs)

241
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,047
Come on, Bones,
you've been at it for hours.

242
00:10:26,082 --> 00:10:27,048
You gotta eat something.

243
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,817
In a little while.

244
00:10:28,851 --> 00:10:31,720
Her old court documents from
when she was a prosecutor have

245
00:10:31,755 --> 00:10:33,455
case numbers,
criminal code numbers,

246
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:34,990
and then there
are zip codes.

247
00:10:35,024 --> 00:10:36,258
Well, that's great and all,

248
00:10:36,293 --> 00:10:38,193
but you know, it's not
gonna be any good

249
00:10:38,227 --> 00:10:40,429
if you starve
yourself to death.

250
00:10:40,463 --> 00:10:42,463
She was laughing
at me, Booth.

251
00:10:42,498 --> 00:10:43,765
I-I can't let her win.

252
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:45,533
She won't.

253
00:10:45,567 --> 00:10:47,435
You hope.

254
00:10:47,469 --> 00:10:49,837
She may be amoral,
but she is brilliant.

255
00:10:49,871 --> 00:10:51,839
Well, you're more brilliant.
What if her dispassion

256
00:10:51,873 --> 00:10:53,040
makes her more logical?

257
00:10:53,074 --> 00:10:55,376
What if that gives her
an advantage over me?

258
00:10:55,411 --> 00:10:57,044
Wait a second.
Now you're upset

259
00:10:57,078 --> 00:10:58,878
because you're not <i>more</i>
like a psychopath?

260
00:10:58,913 --> 00:11:03,350
I just think maybe
I've lost my advantage

261
00:11:03,384 --> 00:11:06,553
because of all the people
I'm involved with now.

262
00:11:08,255 --> 00:11:12,158
All of the relationships--
they complicate logical thought.

263
00:11:12,193 --> 00:11:14,193
You don't mean that.

264
00:11:16,196 --> 00:11:19,231
Could we please just work?

265
00:11:19,265 --> 00:11:21,266
Sure.

266
00:11:24,538 --> 00:11:26,038
Salt Lake City?

267
00:11:26,072 --> 00:11:27,340
What?

268
00:11:27,374 --> 00:11:28,774
When they arrested Taffet,

269
00:11:28,809 --> 00:11:32,210
she used her one phone call
from jail to Salt Lake City.

270
00:11:32,244 --> 00:11:33,645
Area Code 801.

271
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:35,146
Well, she's representing
herself,

272
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,781
so it couldn't be
to a lawyer.

273
00:11:36,816 --> 00:11:39,818
Who would she call
in Salt Lake City?

274
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,120
Hmm...
(Phone line ringing)

275
00:11:43,155 --> 00:11:45,622
(Woman) Larry's pizza,
how may I help you?

276
00:11:50,862 --> 00:11:52,696
None of the employees
at the pizza place

277
00:11:52,731 --> 00:11:54,931
have a connection
to Taffet, and...

278
00:11:54,966 --> 00:11:56,800
none of them here have
any criminal records.

279
00:11:56,835 --> 00:11:58,034
Well, the phone
records show

280
00:11:58,069 --> 00:12:00,337
that Taffet hung up
after ten seconds.

281
00:12:00,372 --> 00:12:02,005
She didn't request
another call.

282
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:04,007
Angela's matching the number

283
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,708
with a numerical
sequencing program.

284
00:12:05,743 --> 00:12:06,910
This is the
number, Booth.

285
00:12:06,944 --> 00:12:08,979
This has to be the number.

286
00:12:15,887 --> 00:12:19,154
(Montenegro) So, I'm running a numerical
sequencing program to see

287
00:12:19,189 --> 00:12:21,723
if there's a match
with any of her victims.

288
00:12:21,758 --> 00:12:24,894
But I'm coming up
with nothing.

289
00:12:35,938 --> 00:12:39,007
Oh, my God, the number is

290
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,675
a GPS location.

291
00:12:47,849 --> 00:12:49,183
(Siren chirps)

292
00:12:49,218 --> 00:12:51,451
(Booth)
Let's go, everybody out.

293
00:12:55,623 --> 00:12:58,158
Oh, God.

294
00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:03,363
(Booth)
Oh, God.

295
00:13:05,733 --> 00:13:08,067
(Creaking)

296
00:13:11,906 --> 00:13:14,407
It's the kid, isn't it?

297
00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:24,183
Terrence Gilroy had

298
00:13:24,217 --> 00:13:28,154
a remodeled right ulna from
a break when he was eight.

299
00:13:32,892 --> 00:13:35,127
This is the boy she kidnapped.

300
00:13:35,162 --> 00:13:37,964
I'm going to call the parents.

301
00:13:37,998 --> 00:13:41,499
Why did she lead
us here, Booth?

302
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:44,369
Why did she want us
to find him?

303
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,047
(Caroline)
Hands off!

304
00:13:57,081 --> 00:13:59,048
Ma'am?
No one touches a thing.

305
00:13:59,058 --> 00:14:00,678
(Alarm blaring)
What are you talking about?

306
00:14:00,717 --> 00:14:03,453
This is our chance to get some
hard evidence they can't dismiss.

307
00:14:03,487 --> 00:14:04,754
Not if you touch it.

308
00:14:04,764 --> 00:14:07,984
You can't act as an
expert witness in a case

309
00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:09,627
when you are also a victim.

310
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:11,794
We aren't victims in this crime.

311
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:14,396
We filed one complaint
with seven counts.

312
00:14:14,431 --> 00:14:15,697
Since the trial started,

313
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:18,100
you and Dr. Brennan are
linked to all the crimes.

314
00:14:18,134 --> 00:14:20,536
That's why Taffet wanted
us to find the boy.

315
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:23,172
She knows we're the only people
who have the skills

316
00:14:23,206 --> 00:14:24,440
to connect her to the crime.

317
00:14:24,474 --> 00:14:25,840
And now our hands are tied.

318
00:14:26,876 --> 00:14:29,210
Not if you drop our case.

319
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:31,979
Excuse me?

320
00:14:32,013 --> 00:14:34,048
If Caroline doesn't prosecute
our kidnappings,

321
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,050
we'd be free to testify
as expert witnesses

322
00:14:36,085 --> 00:14:37,318
in the boy's case.

323
00:14:37,352 --> 00:14:39,387
U'd be willing to do that?
(Hodgins)
No.

324
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:42,723
No. Caroline has to prosecute
our case--

325
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:44,491
Taffet tried to kill us.

326
00:14:44,525 --> 00:14:46,193
All of our evidence
has been throw out.

327
00:14:46,227 --> 00:14:50,097
The rational thing to do is to pursue
a case with fresh, untainted evidence.

328
00:14:50,131 --> 00:14:51,864
Are you kidding me?!

329
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:55,102
Is it really that easy for you
to forget what happened to us?

330
00:14:55,136 --> 00:14:57,437
I will never forget
what happened to us,

331
00:14:57,472 --> 00:14:59,973
or to Booth, or this boy.

332
00:15:00,007 --> 00:15:02,641
You are not the only
one suffering, Dr. Hodgins.

333
00:15:02,675 --> 00:15:04,743
But your emotions
have no relevance--

334
00:15:04,777 --> 00:15:06,445
not if we want
to convict Taffet.

335
00:15:13,153 --> 00:15:14,620
(Glove snaps loudly)

336
00:15:14,654 --> 00:15:17,388
This better work.

337
00:15:19,925 --> 00:15:21,493
(Footsteps receding)

338
00:15:21,527 --> 00:15:24,095
I'll have the charges
dismissed in the morning.

339
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:26,331
You can start right after that.

340
00:15:36,674 --> 00:15:38,275
(Knocking at door)

341
00:15:45,049 --> 00:15:46,683
Okay, so the Gilroy kid--

342
00:15:46,717 --> 00:15:49,118
he was last seen at the
Rockland Mall on June 23.

343
00:15:49,153 --> 00:15:51,787
I'm gonna check all Taffet's credit card
records for that day, too.

344
00:15:51,821 --> 00:15:53,922
Caroline said you can't give
expert testimony

345
00:15:53,957 --> 00:15:55,758
if she's prosecuting
your case.

346
00:15:55,792 --> 00:15:59,228
I told Caroline to drop
my charges, too.

347
00:16:01,165 --> 00:16:02,865
I'm not gonna let
you do this alone.

348
00:16:05,301 --> 00:16:07,669
She's going to see the judge
tomorrow morning at 10:00,

349
00:16:07,703 --> 00:16:09,571
and then we can dive in
on all this.

350
00:16:09,605 --> 00:16:11,439
Thanks, Booth.

351
00:16:11,474 --> 00:16:14,142
We're partners, it's what we do.

352
00:16:14,177 --> 00:16:15,777
Right?

353
00:16:17,413 --> 00:16:20,648
If Taffet is acquitted
on this count,

354
00:16:20,682 --> 00:16:23,217
she can never
be tried again.

355
00:16:23,251 --> 00:16:26,253
Maybe that's why she wanted us
to find the boy.

356
00:16:26,288 --> 00:16:28,155
Yeah, well,
she's arrogant--

357
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,456
like Sweets said.

358
00:16:29,491 --> 00:16:31,158
And she's misjudging you.

359
00:16:31,193 --> 00:16:34,728
I have nightmares, Booth.

360
00:16:36,297 --> 00:16:39,699
Hodgins is bleeding...

361
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:42,268
you're drowning...

362
00:16:44,938 --> 00:16:46,972
I-I can't help anyone.

363
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:48,474
Look, all right, you know what?

364
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:50,109
She's never gonna get the
better of you, all right?

365
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:52,278
Just know that.

366
00:16:52,313 --> 00:16:54,113
All right? I promise, okay?

367
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:08,160
(Brennan)
These are perimortem fractures,

368
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:11,029
bilaterally on the fifth,
sixth and seventh ribs

369
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:13,531
on the posterior axillary lines.

370
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:15,767
And injuries
to the greater cornu

371
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:19,137
and the left lateral
thyroid and cricoid cartilages.

372
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:22,306
I see injuries like this in
victims who've been strangled.

373
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:25,042
Perhaps he struggled, and Taffet
was trying to subdue him.

374
00:17:25,076 --> 00:17:26,810
Taffet tasered
all her victims.

375
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:28,979
Three million volts. That should
be enough to knock out

376
00:17:29,013 --> 00:17:31,014
a ten-year-old boy
for at least a few hours.

377
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:32,116
He wasn't unconscious.

378
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:34,151
These are defensive wounds,

379
00:17:34,185 --> 00:17:36,820
consistent with the boy
resisting being placed

380
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:38,122
in the freezer,
arms outstretched.

381
00:17:38,156 --> 00:17:39,422
I'll take samples

382
00:17:39,457 --> 00:17:40,657
from under his fingernails.

383
00:17:40,691 --> 00:17:42,458
Maybe he scratched her
during the struggle.

384
00:17:42,492 --> 00:17:44,560
Maybe she knew the facts
in this case

385
00:17:44,594 --> 00:17:47,329
wouldn't be consistent
with the other crimes,

386
00:17:47,364 --> 00:17:49,465
and would give her
reasonable doubt.

387
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,008
We have evidence from
credit card charges

388
00:18:00,042 --> 00:18:01,709
that the defendant was at
the Rockland Mall

389
00:18:01,744 --> 00:18:03,979
on the day that Terrence Gilroy
was abducted.

390
00:18:04,013 --> 00:18:07,215
<i>The team at the Jeffersonian</i>
<i>discovered</i>

391
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,451
<i>that the number Taffet</i>
<i>called...</i>

392
00:18:10,486 --> 00:18:13,687
<i>turned out to be</i>
<i>the same GPS coordinates</i>

393
00:18:13,721 --> 00:18:16,423
<i>as to where the boy</i>
<i>was buried.</i>

394
00:18:16,457 --> 00:18:20,027
<i>The same M.O.,</i>
<i>same ransom tape,</i>

395
00:18:20,061 --> 00:18:22,897
<i>the same demands</i>
<i>as the other kidnappings.</i>

396
00:18:22,931 --> 00:18:24,832
Do you have any evidence
that the Gilroy boy

397
00:18:24,866 --> 00:18:26,066
was abducted from the mall?

398
00:18:26,101 --> 00:18:28,602
It was the last place
he was seen.

399
00:18:28,636 --> 00:18:30,904
So, no.
Did anyone else

400
00:18:30,938 --> 00:18:33,472
make any purchases at the mall
that day, or was it just me?

401
00:18:33,507 --> 00:18:34,674
Of course they did, but...

402
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:37,110
As for the phone call
that I allegedly made,

403
00:18:37,144 --> 00:18:40,413
is it possible that the number was
placed in my file by mistake?

404
00:18:40,447 --> 00:18:41,580
(Caroline)
Objection.

405
00:18:41,615 --> 00:18:43,316
Conjecture.
Sustained.

406
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,750
Did you know that
the officer on duty

407
00:18:44,785 --> 00:18:46,551
the night I was arrested
was from Salt Lake?

408
00:18:48,988 --> 00:18:50,789
Answer the question,
Agent Booth.

409
00:18:50,824 --> 00:18:52,057
No.

410
00:18:52,091 --> 00:18:53,959
(Taffet)
Isn't it more likely

411
00:18:53,993 --> 00:18:56,195
that he made that call,
and the number

412
00:18:56,229 --> 00:18:58,463
was placed in my
file by mistake?

413
00:18:58,497 --> 00:19:00,598
Objection. Conjecture again.

414
00:19:00,633 --> 00:19:02,200
I thought it was
reasonable doubt.

415
00:19:02,234 --> 00:19:03,467
Very reasonable.

416
00:19:03,501 --> 00:19:05,136
Your honor...
withdrawn.

417
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,938
No further questions,
your honor.

418
00:19:16,381 --> 00:19:17,914
(Sighs)

419
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,821
You know that Taffet's
playing you, right?

420
00:19:24,856 --> 00:19:26,189
We're fine, Max.

421
00:19:26,224 --> 00:19:27,891
No, she's got you
all on defense.

422
00:19:27,925 --> 00:19:29,425
We got the boy, all right?

423
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,694
It's because she wanted you to.
Every psycho takes

424
00:19:31,729 --> 00:19:33,929
one step too far
and hangs themself.

425
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:37,333
Not before a lot
of innocent people get hurt.

426
00:19:38,768 --> 00:19:39,869
I'll see you later.

427
00:19:46,542 --> 00:19:48,210
(Knocking at door)

428
00:19:49,945 --> 00:19:51,312
Hey, sorry
to bother you.

429
00:19:51,347 --> 00:19:52,747
You have a minute?

430
00:19:52,781 --> 00:19:53,948
Yeah, sure.

431
00:19:55,885 --> 00:19:57,285
(Sighs)

432
00:19:59,755 --> 00:20:01,689
How's it going?

433
00:20:01,723 --> 00:20:03,124
I don't know, actually.

434
00:20:03,158 --> 00:20:06,093
That's why I'm here. I-I'm...

435
00:20:06,127 --> 00:20:10,330
I'm worried,
Dr. Sweets. I-I...

436
00:20:10,365 --> 00:20:12,533
this case is taking
its toll on everyone.

437
00:20:12,567 --> 00:20:13,534
Including you?

438
00:20:13,568 --> 00:20:15,836
Including me, yes.

439
00:20:15,871 --> 00:20:17,805
It's a very stressful
situation.

440
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:20,775
I mean, you're not immune
to that.

441
00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:23,009
I feel like everything's fraying
around the edges.

442
00:20:23,043 --> 00:20:25,011
We're all searching for some
piece of evidence

443
00:20:25,045 --> 00:20:26,513
that can put Taffet away.

444
00:20:26,547 --> 00:20:28,047
But we keep
coming up empty.

445
00:20:28,081 --> 00:20:29,783
Everyone feels
manipulated by her.

446
00:20:29,817 --> 00:20:33,019
And I-I should be able
to pull everyone together--

447
00:20:33,053 --> 00:20:35,254
keep them on track.

448
00:20:35,289 --> 00:20:37,623
You want to guarantee
the outcome.

449
00:20:40,727 --> 00:20:43,595
I wish that were possible.

450
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:46,665
But you know, we knew this was
going to be an uphill battle.

451
00:20:46,699 --> 00:20:48,199
But did we really
believe that?

452
00:20:48,234 --> 00:20:49,868
We all knew she was guilty.

453
00:20:49,903 --> 00:20:53,238
So someplace, we assumed
that in a just world

454
00:20:53,272 --> 00:20:55,940
she'd pay for what she did.

455
00:20:55,974 --> 00:21:00,578
That assumes a just world,
I'm afraid.

456
00:21:00,612 --> 00:21:03,247
These...

457
00:21:03,281 --> 00:21:06,050
are my people she hurt,
my friends.

458
00:21:06,084 --> 00:21:07,318
I should...

459
00:21:08,887 --> 00:21:10,921
...be able to do something.

460
00:21:14,659 --> 00:21:16,125
I know.

461
00:21:41,684 --> 00:21:43,217
(Rifle cocking)

462
00:21:55,965 --> 00:21:59,600
Max, you didn't think I
was going to follow you?

463
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:06,874
(Grunting)

464
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:09,209
(Panting)

465
00:22:09,243 --> 00:22:10,777
Max, is this what you want?

466
00:22:10,812 --> 00:22:12,112
Don't trust the system, Booth.

467
00:22:12,146 --> 00:22:14,246
You miss, you compromise
the case, Taffet walks.

468
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,147
I don't miss!
(Groans)

469
00:22:21,488 --> 00:22:22,788
When are you
gonna learn

470
00:22:22,823 --> 00:22:24,590
to stop messing with me, huh?

471
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:26,225
You're making a big mistake.

472
00:22:26,259 --> 00:22:27,927
Tempe could die.

473
00:22:29,362 --> 00:22:31,062
Yeah, come on.

474
00:22:34,391 --> 00:22:35,423
He tried to kill her?

475
00:22:35,457 --> 00:22:36,992
Well, he had a rifle
pointed right at her,

476
00:22:37,026 --> 00:22:38,493
so you do the math.
Why?

477
00:22:38,528 --> 00:22:39,961
Why would
he do that?

478
00:22:39,996 --> 00:22:40,962
To protect you.

479
00:22:40,997 --> 00:22:42,196
And a career criminal
like Max--

480
00:22:42,231 --> 00:22:44,432
he obviously doesn't
trust the legal system.

481
00:22:44,466 --> 00:22:45,901
I'm sorry, Booth.

482
00:22:45,935 --> 00:22:47,602
I wish he were different.
Yeah, me, too.

483
00:22:47,637 --> 00:22:49,538
You know, he socked
me in the eye, too.

484
00:22:49,572 --> 00:22:50,938
(Cell phone ringing)

485
00:22:50,972 --> 00:22:51,939
Brennan.

486
00:22:51,973 --> 00:22:53,306
Hey, honey.

487
00:22:53,341 --> 00:22:54,842
I need you to bail me out.

488
00:22:54,876 --> 00:22:56,777
What?! No, dad.

489
00:22:56,811 --> 00:22:58,412
I was doing it for you.

490
00:22:58,446 --> 00:23:01,582
No, I don't want you
to kill people for me.

491
00:23:01,616 --> 00:23:03,551
Just buy me a sweater,
like a regular dad.

492
00:23:03,585 --> 00:23:04,585
Leave her alone, Max.

493
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:06,186
Booth says you're not
getting out

494
00:23:06,187 --> 00:23:07,820
until after the trial over.

495
00:23:07,855 --> 00:23:09,722
I have to go.
Whoa.
I've got a bad back.

496
00:23:09,757 --> 00:23:11,490
You know what the beds
are like in jail.

497
00:23:11,525 --> 00:23:12,491
Good-bye, dad.

498
00:23:12,526 --> 00:23:14,260
(Snaps phone shut)

499
00:23:14,294 --> 00:23:15,628
Look,
I'm sorry, Bones.

500
00:23:15,663 --> 00:23:18,097
I'm sure this is the last thing
you want to deal with.

501
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:19,098
Yeah.

502
00:23:19,132 --> 00:23:21,233
Part of me wishes he'd done it.

503
00:23:21,268 --> 00:23:22,435
Well, not the good part,

504
00:23:22,469 --> 00:23:24,502
so let's just keep
our eye on the ball.

505
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:28,173
So, any news about the boy?

506
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:30,508
I'm getting an accurate
recreation of the assailant

507
00:23:30,543 --> 00:23:32,177
from the fracture patterns
on his remains,

508
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:33,511
and it's a match for Taffet.

509
00:23:33,546 --> 00:23:35,413
I'm putting a presentation
together for court.

510
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:37,415
The kid-- he put up
a good fight, huh?

511
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,316
There's evidence
of strong resistance.

512
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,417
Yes.

513
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:41,919
Yeah, at least he
didn't go easy.

514
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:45,056
Parker... he'd do
the same thing.

515
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,924
Probably bite
her ear off and run.

516
00:23:48,961 --> 00:23:50,828
He'd bite her?
Yeah.

517
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:53,130
Ten-year-olds--
it's kind of their thing.

518
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:55,732
They bite.

519
00:23:55,766 --> 00:23:58,668
I have to get back to the lab.

520
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,878
(Brennan) If the boy bit her,
there should be some evidence

521
00:24:08,913 --> 00:24:11,380
on his maxilla,
mandible or his teeth.

522
00:24:11,415 --> 00:24:13,449
(Hodgins) The teeth seem to
have been cleaned.

523
00:24:13,484 --> 00:24:15,384
Taffet probably wiped them off.

524
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:17,686
Second left premolar is chipped.

525
00:24:17,721 --> 00:24:20,156
There might be some trace
in the abrasion,

526
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:22,725
maybe some tissue
from Heather Taffet.

527
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:24,727
Saliva contains amylase
that would have

528
00:24:24,761 --> 00:24:26,162
broken down any bits of tissue.

529
00:24:26,196 --> 00:24:30,298
Not if it were imbedded between
the teeth or under the gum line.

530
00:24:36,372 --> 00:24:39,073
(Gravedigger)
<i>If I don't receive the money</i>

531
00:24:39,108 --> 00:24:42,444
within eight hours,
your child will die.

532
00:24:42,478 --> 00:24:44,211
This is the last...

533
00:24:44,246 --> 00:24:46,380
Okay, this encryption
is a rolling code

534
00:24:46,414 --> 00:24:47,948
split band voice
inversion.

535
00:24:47,982 --> 00:24:49,283
Individual frequencies

536
00:24:49,317 --> 00:24:52,486
between the clicks
are inverted and recombined.

537
00:24:52,521 --> 00:24:54,121
I applied software

538
00:24:54,156 --> 00:24:57,625
that decrypts each of
the 423 separate segments

539
00:24:57,659 --> 00:24:58,992
until the voice
becomes clear.

540
00:24:59,027 --> 00:25:01,628
(Semi-distorted):
if I don't receive the money

541
00:25:01,662 --> 00:25:04,397
in the numbered account
within eight hours,

542
00:25:04,431 --> 00:25:06,399
(clear, female voice)
your child will die.

543
00:25:06,433 --> 00:25:09,068
This is the last time
you will hear from me.

544
00:25:09,102 --> 00:25:12,338
There will be no further...
You did it, Angela.

545
00:25:12,373 --> 00:25:13,706
It's Taffet.

546
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:16,241
Like to see her
explain away that one.

547
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:20,546
(Taffet)
If I don't receive the money
in the numbered account

548
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:24,183
within eight hours,
your child will die.

549
00:25:24,217 --> 00:25:26,885
This is the last time
you will hear from me.

550
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:29,688
There will be
no further communications.

551
00:25:29,722 --> 00:25:32,290
And in your expert
opinion, Ms. Montenegro,

552
00:25:32,324 --> 00:25:33,424
whose voice is that?

553
00:25:33,458 --> 00:25:34,958
It's Heather Taffet.

554
00:25:34,993 --> 00:25:38,596
The frequency and vocal patterns
are an exact match when compared

555
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:40,364
to unencrypted recordings
of her voice.

556
00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:41,965
(Caroline)
Thank you.

557
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,301
No further questions.

558
00:25:43,335 --> 00:25:44,902
(Taffet)
That was very

559
00:25:44,936 --> 00:25:47,237
impressive, Ms. Montenegro.

560
00:25:47,271 --> 00:25:49,739
Could you share your credentials
with the court?

561
00:25:49,773 --> 00:25:52,309
I have a bachelor of fine arts
from the University of Texas

562
00:25:52,343 --> 00:25:54,110
with a minor
in computer science.

563
00:25:54,144 --> 00:25:56,413
And I've also studied
biomedical illustration

564
00:25:56,447 --> 00:25:57,780
at American University.

565
00:25:57,815 --> 00:25:59,182
But you do not have a degree

566
00:25:59,217 --> 00:26:01,184
in sound engineering,
is that correct?

567
00:26:01,219 --> 00:26:02,619
No.

568
00:26:02,653 --> 00:26:04,620
(Caroline)
Objection. Ms.
Montenegro has

569
00:26:04,654 --> 00:26:06,255
numerous patents pending from

570
00:26:06,289 --> 00:26:08,824
her work in auditory
forensic reconstruction.

571
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:10,426
The homeless man on my street

572
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,361
has a patent pending
for a time machine.

573
00:26:12,395 --> 00:26:14,763
That doesn't mean I'm going to
ask him to testify in court.

574
00:26:14,797 --> 00:26:16,164
(Judge)
That's enough,
Ms. Taffet.

575
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,533
Do you have anything else
for this witness?

576
00:26:17,567 --> 00:26:18,601
Yes, your honor.

577
00:26:18,635 --> 00:26:20,268
I'd like to
introduce into evidence

578
00:26:20,302 --> 00:26:22,637
item 461b,

579
00:26:22,671 --> 00:26:25,406
which is a deconstruction
of the same ransom tape

580
00:26:25,441 --> 00:26:28,276
by former FBI special
Agent Graham Steele,

581
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,911
who has a Phd

582
00:26:29,946 --> 00:26:31,146
in forensic auditory analysis

583
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:34,649
from the University
of Pennsylvania.

584
00:26:34,683 --> 00:26:37,718
(Montenegro)
If I don't receive the money
in the numbered account

585
00:26:37,753 --> 00:26:39,854
within eight hours,
your child will die.

586
00:26:39,888 --> 00:26:41,756
(Montenegro)
Th-that isn't me.

587
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,891
He obviously manipulated
the pitch and the timbre

588
00:26:43,925 --> 00:26:45,325
of the voice.

589
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,560
Isn't that what you did?
No.

590
00:26:46,594 --> 00:26:48,229
Those sound waves have

591
00:26:48,263 --> 00:26:50,631
an underlying pattern
of frequency modulation.

592
00:26:50,665 --> 00:26:51,798
Like a fingerprint.

593
00:26:51,832 --> 00:26:54,267
(Taffet)
Whatever the
technical jargon,

594
00:26:54,301 --> 00:26:56,302
it seems clear that anyone,

595
00:26:56,336 --> 00:26:58,471
even someone without
any credentials,

596
00:26:58,505 --> 00:26:59,973
can make one voice
sound like another.

597
00:27:00,007 --> 00:27:01,040
(Caroline)
Objection!

598
00:27:01,075 --> 00:27:02,508
Counsel is making speeches.

599
00:27:02,542 --> 00:27:04,377
Sustained.
(Taffet)
I'm sorry, your honor.

600
00:27:04,411 --> 00:27:06,412
No further questions.

601
00:27:24,151 --> 00:27:25,952
Hey, Bones, you ready for court?

602
00:27:25,986 --> 00:27:26,953
Yes.

603
00:27:26,987 --> 00:27:28,922
I have a video presentation

604
00:27:28,956 --> 00:27:31,491
which shows the victim
sustained rib fractures

605
00:27:31,526 --> 00:27:33,159
as well as a fracture
of the lateral

606
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,193
epicondyle of the left distal...

607
00:27:34,228 --> 00:27:35,494
What do you say we ease up

608
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:36,762
on the scientific stuff, okay?

609
00:27:36,797 --> 00:27:39,998
The science gives us
the height of the assailant.

610
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,166
162 centimeters--

611
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,401
Taffet's height.

612
00:27:42,436 --> 00:27:43,669
That's, that's,
that's good and all,

613
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:45,304
but Taffet's kind of
had a field day,

614
00:27:45,338 --> 00:27:46,371
you know, trashing the whole

615
00:27:46,406 --> 00:27:47,907
technical goobledy stuff.

616
00:27:47,941 --> 00:27:50,142
And the jury seems
to like her for it.

617
00:27:50,176 --> 00:27:52,209
But those are the facts.

618
00:27:52,244 --> 00:27:55,146
It's how you present
the facts that

619
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,014
win or lose a case.

620
00:27:57,049 --> 00:27:59,183
Bones, the jury needs to know

621
00:27:59,217 --> 00:28:01,886
what that little boy
went through.

622
00:28:01,921 --> 00:28:04,422
I've...

623
00:28:04,457 --> 00:28:06,458
I've testified before, Booth.

624
00:28:06,492 --> 00:28:07,458
I'll be fine.

625
00:28:07,492 --> 00:28:09,660
We-we should go.

626
00:28:09,694 --> 00:28:11,294
Okay.

627
00:28:13,331 --> 00:28:14,798
(Brennan)
<i>Terrence Gilroy's</i>

628
00:28:14,833 --> 00:28:18,401
left greater cornu of
the hyoid was compressed,

629
00:28:18,436 --> 00:28:20,236
indicating that the assailant

630
00:28:20,271 --> 00:28:23,306
strangled the young boy
using only one hand--

631
00:28:23,341 --> 00:28:25,508
the dominant left hand,
in this case.

632
00:28:25,542 --> 00:28:26,709
(Caroline)
I'd like to submit

633
00:28:26,743 --> 00:28:28,578
writing samples

634
00:28:28,612 --> 00:28:31,413
which confirm that the defendant
is left-handed.

635
00:28:31,448 --> 00:28:33,115
(Taffet)
No objection, as long
as it's also noted

636
00:28:33,149 --> 00:28:34,784
that eight percent
of the general population

637
00:28:34,818 --> 00:28:36,318
is also left-handed.

638
00:28:36,353 --> 00:28:38,020
Including you, your honor.

639
00:28:38,054 --> 00:28:39,855

00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:42,190
Continue.

641
00:28:42,224 --> 00:28:45,560
The victim sustained a fracture

642
00:28:45,595 --> 00:28:48,897
of the lateral epicondyle
and the shaft

643
00:28:48,931 --> 00:28:51,099
of the left distal humerus.

644
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:56,036
Perhaps I can be clearer.

645
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:59,439
Terrence Gilroy's bones
could only have been broken

646
00:28:59,474 --> 00:29:01,509
by someone kneeling
on top of him

647
00:29:01,543 --> 00:29:04,311
as they pushed him
into the freezer.

648
00:29:04,345 --> 00:29:06,580
The radiating
fracture lines show

649
00:29:06,615 --> 00:29:08,482
that this assailant
had to be between

650
00:29:08,517 --> 00:29:11,251
125 and 135 pounds--

651
00:29:11,285 --> 00:29:12,785
the weight of the defendant.

652
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,754
Objection. This is speculation.

653
00:29:14,788 --> 00:29:16,355
Are you questioning
my qualifications?

654
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:17,924
Because you will not find

655
00:29:17,958 --> 00:29:20,693
a more experienced or respected
forensic anthropologist

656
00:29:20,728 --> 00:29:22,028
anywhere in the world.

657
00:29:22,062 --> 00:29:23,596
So I'd appreciate
not being interrupted

658
00:29:23,631 --> 00:29:25,231
until I finish testifying.

659
00:29:25,265 --> 00:29:26,766
(Judge)
Dr. Brennan,

660
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,934
I'll make the rulings here.

661
00:29:30,202 --> 00:29:31,904
Overruled.

662
00:29:31,938 --> 00:29:33,438
Continue.

663
00:29:33,472 --> 00:29:36,608
Since these broken bones were
caused by the assailant's knees

664
00:29:36,643 --> 00:29:39,044
and the chipping
on the boy's kneecaps

665
00:29:39,078 --> 00:29:41,446
was caused by the toes of

666
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,848
her heavy boots,
we can determine the length

667
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:45,115
of her shin.

668
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,317
And what is the significance
of the shin length?

669
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:49,687
It gives us the height
of the assailant,

670
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:51,756
which is five feet, four inches.

671
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,925
The same height
as the defendant.

672
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:56,961
It is clear from
the circumstantial evidence

673
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:59,296
and these facts
that this child was attacked

674
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,031
with vicious cruelty
by Ms. Taffet.

675
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:02,298
Objection.

676
00:30:02,332 --> 00:30:04,568
The jury makes that
determination, not the witness.

677
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:07,270
The five-foot-four assailant...

678
00:30:08,372 --> 00:30:10,473
...crushed the boy's chest,

679
00:30:10,507 --> 00:30:12,141
choked him,

680
00:30:12,176 --> 00:30:15,045
and finally caused him
a torturous death

681
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,278
by burying him alive.

682
00:30:16,312 --> 00:30:17,947
Objection.
Speculation.

683
00:30:17,981 --> 00:30:19,347
She can't know
what the witness felt.

684
00:30:19,382 --> 00:30:20,449
I was buried alive.

685
00:30:26,222 --> 00:30:27,623
Which makes me
uniquely qualified

686
00:30:27,657 --> 00:30:29,324
to comment on its horror.

687
00:30:29,358 --> 00:30:30,425
Objection, your honor.

688
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,593
This is grandstanding.

689
00:30:31,627 --> 00:30:33,561
Unless the witness has
any additional facts...

690
00:30:33,596 --> 00:30:35,529
Sustained.

691
00:30:35,564 --> 00:30:37,031
Do you have
any further questions

692
00:30:37,066 --> 00:30:38,265
for Dr. Brennan, Ms. Julian?

693
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,467
No, your honor.

694
00:30:39,501 --> 00:30:42,003
I learned everything
I need to know.

695
00:30:42,037 --> 00:30:43,270
Your witness.

696
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,774
(Taffet)
Dr. Brennan,

697
00:30:47,809 --> 00:30:50,577
don't you think your trauma
as a kidnapping victim

698
00:30:50,612 --> 00:30:52,412
prevents you
from being objective?

699
00:30:52,446 --> 00:30:53,680
(Caroline)
Objection.

700
00:30:53,715 --> 00:30:57,417
She is testifying as
an expert witness, not a victim.

701
00:30:57,451 --> 00:30:59,019
She brought up being
buried alive, your honor.

702
00:30:59,053 --> 00:31:01,354
(Judge)
She did, Ms. Julian.

703
00:31:01,388 --> 00:31:02,522
Overruled.

704
00:31:02,556 --> 00:31:04,556
It's only natural
that you would want

705
00:31:04,591 --> 00:31:07,827
to construct facts that would
give you some closure and peace.

706
00:31:07,861 --> 00:31:09,194
I resent your implication.

707
00:31:09,229 --> 00:31:11,731
I do not let my emotions
cloud my findings.

708
00:31:11,765 --> 00:31:13,398
No, not intentionally,
of course.

709
00:31:13,433 --> 00:31:14,667
Is there a question coming?

710
00:31:14,701 --> 00:31:15,668
Yes.

711
00:31:15,702 --> 00:31:16,669
Sorry.

712
00:31:16,703 --> 00:31:18,070
Dr. Brennan,
you are currently seeing

713
00:31:18,105 --> 00:31:19,838
an FBI psychologist,
are you not?

714
00:31:19,872 --> 00:31:21,740
What... that has
nothing to do with...

715
00:31:21,774 --> 00:31:23,141
A yes or no
is all that's required,

716
00:31:23,175 --> 00:31:24,142
Dr. Brennan.

717
00:31:24,176 --> 00:31:26,144
Are you currently
seeing an FBI

718
00:31:26,178 --> 00:31:27,311
psychologist?

719
00:31:28,748 --> 00:31:29,748
Yes, but...
Thank you.

720
00:31:29,782 --> 00:31:31,683
No further questions.
No, that has

721
00:31:31,717 --> 00:31:33,051
nothing to do with this case.

722
00:31:33,085 --> 00:31:35,153
My findings are sound.

723
00:31:35,187 --> 00:31:36,987
You may step down, Dr. Brennan.

724
00:31:37,022 --> 00:31:39,322
My findings are sound.

725
00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:50,467
(Saroyan)
A dust mite?

726
00:31:50,501 --> 00:31:52,401
So that little bug
is gonna save us?

727
00:31:52,435 --> 00:31:53,670
Oh, don't
call him a bug.

728
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:54,737
Sounds insulting.

729
00:31:54,772 --> 00:31:56,272
We reexamined the boy's teeth

730
00:31:56,306 --> 00:31:58,174
and found it wedged
between the right lateral

731
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,842
incisor and canine.

732
00:31:59,877 --> 00:32:02,378
Dust mites eat
dead human skin cells.

733
00:32:02,412 --> 00:32:04,580
And this one's
stomach sac is full.

734
00:32:04,614 --> 00:32:05,982
If the boy
bit Taffet,

735
00:32:06,016 --> 00:32:07,483
the skin cells
are probably hers.

736
00:32:07,517 --> 00:32:08,850
Whatever's left is

737
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:12,020
gonna be small, but there
might be enough to give us DNA.

738
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:16,024
(Hodgins)
<i>This is a</i>

739
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:18,026
<i>dermatophagoides farinae.</i>
(Caroline)
For those of us who don't

740
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,828
speak insect,
what is that, exactly?

741
00:32:19,862 --> 00:32:21,129
It's a dust mite--

742
00:32:21,164 --> 00:32:24,699
an insect found on clothes,
but it also feeds on

743
00:32:24,733 --> 00:32:27,202
the cells of the person
wearing those clothes.

744
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:29,504
(Caroline)
And where was this
dust mite found?

745
00:32:29,538 --> 00:32:31,739
Between Terrence Gilroy's teeth.

746
00:32:31,773 --> 00:32:33,708
It was transferred
there when the boy

747
00:32:33,742 --> 00:32:35,843
bit the person
who kidnapped him.

748
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:38,680
And how do we know that?

749
00:32:38,714 --> 00:32:42,382
The dust mite contained
human female epithelial cells.

750
00:32:42,417 --> 00:32:44,151
We extracted those cells

751
00:32:44,186 --> 00:32:47,021
and ran them through
several DNA databases.

752
00:32:47,055 --> 00:32:49,023
The cells belonged
to Heather Taffet.

753
00:32:50,726 --> 00:32:52,860
Nothing further, your honor.

754
00:32:52,894 --> 00:32:54,862
Your witness, Ms. Taffet.

755
00:32:54,896 --> 00:32:58,664
It seems that you have
neglected to include

756
00:32:58,699 --> 00:33:01,634
a sample of the evidence that I
could have tested independently.

757
00:33:01,668 --> 00:33:03,502
Since there were so
few cells in the mite,

758
00:33:03,537 --> 00:33:04,771
the testing destroyed
the sample,

759
00:33:04,805 --> 00:33:06,372
but the procedures and results

760
00:33:06,406 --> 00:33:08,341
are all contained
in our documentation.

761
00:33:08,375 --> 00:33:10,710
Let me get this right.

762
00:33:10,745 --> 00:33:13,712
I have access to your notes,
but I can't examine

763
00:33:13,747 --> 00:33:16,281
the actual evidence
because you destroyed it?

764
00:33:16,315 --> 00:33:19,017
Your honor, in <i>California</i>
<i>versus Trombetta,</i>

765
00:33:19,052 --> 00:33:20,518
the Supreme Court ruled
that the prosecution

766
00:33:20,553 --> 00:33:23,055
could destroy a sample
to test for DNA

767
00:33:23,089 --> 00:33:24,957
because there was no bad faith.

768
00:33:24,991 --> 00:33:26,125
Bad faith?

769
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:27,659
The motives of
every single person

770
00:33:27,693 --> 00:33:28,993
at the Jeffersonian are suspect,

771
00:33:29,027 --> 00:33:31,996
and now their only physical
evidence is gone--

772
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,164
if it existed at all.

773
00:33:33,198 --> 00:33:34,498
(Caroline)
I've just about had it

774
00:33:34,532 --> 00:33:36,400
with your snide,
unsubstantiated allegations.

775
00:33:36,434 --> 00:33:39,070
As have I.
That's enough, Ms. Julian.

776
00:33:39,104 --> 00:33:41,639
(Taffet)
Your honor, I would
like to file a motion

777
00:33:41,673 --> 00:33:44,875
to have this unverifiable
DNA evidence dismissed.

778
00:33:44,909 --> 00:33:46,109
Protocol has been followed,
Ms. Taffet.

779
00:33:46,144 --> 00:33:47,443
It's up to the jury

780
00:33:47,478 --> 00:33:48,879
to decide how the evidence
will figure

781
00:33:48,913 --> 00:33:50,313
in the outcome of this case.

782
00:33:50,347 --> 00:33:51,447
Your motion is denied.

783
00:34:01,624 --> 00:34:02,958
Did you see Taffet's face?

784
00:34:02,993 --> 00:34:04,493
She was completely blindsided.

785
00:34:04,527 --> 00:34:06,295
Okay, Caroline's
closing--

786
00:34:06,329 --> 00:34:08,264
it's going to kill.

787
00:34:08,298 --> 00:34:10,833
All right,
so here we go.

788
00:34:10,867 --> 00:34:12,902
That's it, huh?

789
00:34:14,137 --> 00:34:15,570
Are you okay, Bones?

790
00:34:15,605 --> 00:34:17,571
Your team just nailed Taffet.

791
00:34:17,606 --> 00:34:19,340
I'm just tired.

792
00:34:19,374 --> 00:34:20,608
Yeah. Yeah.

793
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:22,277
It's been a...
it's been a tough case.

794
00:34:23,779 --> 00:34:26,447
It's not just the case.

795
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:28,716
I'm tired of...

796
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:31,152
of all of it.

797
00:34:31,187 --> 00:34:33,620
I'm tired of dealing
with murders

798
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:37,024
and victims and sadness
and pain.

799
00:34:37,058 --> 00:34:38,525
Well, Bones,

800
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:39,960
that's what we do.

801
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:41,394
All right?
We catch the bad people,

802
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:43,030
and we make the world
a better place.

803
00:34:43,064 --> 00:34:44,364
No, Booth.

804
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:45,632
That's what you do,
and somehow,

805
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,534
I got caught up into it.
Wait a sec.

806
00:34:47,568 --> 00:34:49,468
Hold on. You were dealing
with dead people

807
00:34:49,502 --> 00:34:50,937
long before we got together.

808
00:34:50,971 --> 00:34:53,372
As a researcher,
an anthropologist.

809
00:34:53,406 --> 00:34:55,674
That's how I can make
the world a better place.

810
00:34:55,709 --> 00:34:56,809
And you do. Come on.

811
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:58,444
You make the world
a great place.

812
00:34:58,478 --> 00:34:59,712
Hey.

813
00:34:59,746 --> 00:35:01,914
Cheers to that, all right?

814
00:35:01,949 --> 00:35:03,682
You're just anxious.

815
00:35:03,717 --> 00:35:05,917
All right?
And tomorrow,

816
00:35:05,952 --> 00:35:08,053
when we have won,
everything will be perfect.

817
00:35:08,087 --> 00:35:09,821
It'll be fine.

818
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,001
(Caroline)
<i>We are here to seek justice</i>

819
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:24,670
for this ten year-old boy

820
00:35:24,704 --> 00:35:27,740
who was kidnapped,
brutally beaten

821
00:35:27,774 --> 00:35:30,776
and buried alive
by Heather Taffet.

822
00:35:30,811 --> 00:35:33,879
Taffet was seen
where this child was abducted.

823
00:35:33,914 --> 00:35:36,214
She matches the size
of the assailant.

824
00:35:36,249 --> 00:35:38,016
She's left-handed.

825
00:35:38,051 --> 00:35:41,118
Her voice was discovered
on the ransom tapes.

826
00:35:41,153 --> 00:35:43,287
It all sounds very reasonable,
doesn't it?

827
00:35:43,322 --> 00:35:45,557
These so-called facts

828
00:35:45,591 --> 00:35:47,592
were compiled by people
who themselves

829
00:35:47,626 --> 00:35:49,727
were victims
of a vicious criminal

830
00:35:49,762 --> 00:35:51,863
who has not yet been caught.

831
00:35:51,897 --> 00:35:53,164
They need a scapegoat.

832
00:35:53,198 --> 00:35:56,467
But only Heather Taffet
could have the DNA

833
00:35:56,501 --> 00:35:58,802
that was found
in this child's mouth.

834
00:35:58,837 --> 00:36:00,871
That evidence was delivered

835
00:36:00,905 --> 00:36:03,173
to us in death
by this brave boy.

836
00:36:03,207 --> 00:36:07,077
And yet, the only people
who saw that dust mite,

837
00:36:07,111 --> 00:36:12,014
the only people who touched
the alleged epithelial cells

838
00:36:12,048 --> 00:36:13,883
were two kidnap victims--

839
00:36:13,917 --> 00:36:16,619
one a known
conspiracy theorist,

840
00:36:16,653 --> 00:36:18,955
the other a traumatized
anthropologist

841
00:36:18,989 --> 00:36:21,090
who's currently being
treated by a psychologist.

842
00:36:21,124 --> 00:36:23,025
And Dr. Saroyan,

843
00:36:23,059 --> 00:36:26,295
who couldn't perform her job
without destroying the evidence,

844
00:36:26,329 --> 00:36:29,364
conveniently preventing me
from mounting a defense.

845
00:36:29,398 --> 00:36:33,502
Because she has no defense,
except slandering these experts.

846
00:36:33,536 --> 00:36:37,405
They have told you what
Heather Taffet did to that boy.

847
00:36:37,439 --> 00:36:38,773
The law is clear.

848
00:36:38,808 --> 00:36:43,444
You cannot convict a person
based on innuendo

849
00:36:43,479 --> 00:36:45,513
or groundless accusations.

850
00:36:45,547 --> 00:36:47,381
I weep for that boy.

851
00:36:47,415 --> 00:36:49,216
No child should
suffer like that,

852
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:51,585
and whoever did this...

853
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:56,690
...should never be allowed to
walk among decent people again.

854
00:36:56,725 --> 00:37:01,728
For that boy, for justice,
you must return a verdict of...

855
00:37:01,762 --> 00:37:03,329
...Not guilty.

856
00:37:03,363 --> 00:37:06,298
Because it's clear
that I am a scapegoat.

857
00:37:06,333 --> 00:37:08,768
I am innocent.

858
00:37:10,671 --> 00:37:12,672
Thank you.

859
00:37:18,011 --> 00:37:20,078
What'd I tell you, huh?
Caroline nailed it in there.

860
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:22,915
Taffet was pretty convincing in there, too.
You know what, Hodgins?

861
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,416
You ever see the bright side
in things?

862
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,817
(Hodgins)
You know what, Booth?
You're right.

863
00:37:25,852 --> 00:37:27,686
Because no matter what happens
in there,

864
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,655
I've got Angela.
(Montenegro)
Hodgins.

865
00:37:29,689 --> 00:37:30,989
(Hodgins)
It's okay.

866
00:37:31,024 --> 00:37:32,557
I don't care, Angie.

867
00:37:32,591 --> 00:37:34,725
Look, Taffet's not going
to make the rules anymore.

868
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,760
I want our friends
to know.

869
00:37:35,794 --> 00:37:37,261
I want everybody to know.
Okay.

870
00:37:37,295 --> 00:37:39,630
Angela and I are married.

871
00:37:39,665 --> 00:37:41,699
What?
(Others murmuring and gasping)

872
00:37:41,733 --> 00:37:42,934
Ohh...

873
00:37:42,968 --> 00:37:44,468
Hey, look at that, huh?

874
00:37:44,502 --> 00:37:45,703
What? When, Ang?

875
00:37:45,737 --> 00:37:47,137
In jail.

876
00:37:47,172 --> 00:37:50,440
Hodgins wanted to wait
until this was over,

877
00:37:50,474 --> 00:37:52,375
so everybody
could be happy for us.

878
00:37:52,409 --> 00:37:54,010
This isn't another
pregnancy scare, is it?

879
00:37:54,045 --> 00:37:55,979
No. No, this is...

880
00:37:56,013 --> 00:37:58,014
This is love.

881
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,851
(Sweets)
So...

882
00:38:01,886 --> 00:38:03,119
Why were you hiding this
from us?

883
00:38:03,153 --> 00:38:04,820
Oh, I was having trouble
dealing with things

884
00:38:04,854 --> 00:38:06,021
because of the trial.

885
00:38:06,056 --> 00:38:07,355
Then I thought...

886
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:08,891
screw it.

00:39:47,517 --> 00:39:49,652
Well, I knew Tempe had
everything under control.

Uh-huh.

All right, let's just

Hey!
Oh, and Caroline.

00:39:55,592 --> 00:39:56,958
Hear, hear.
Hear, hear.

923
00:39:56,993 --> 00:39:59,227
You know, I never doubted any
of you-- not for a minute.

Where'd you come from?
Oh, come on.

I guess I'll go home.

A real bed is probably
going to feel good.

940

I'm sorry that I, uh...
that I doubted you.

941
00:40:38,032 --> 00:40:39,833
Sweets would say
that subconsciously

942
00:40:39,867 --> 00:40:41,500
you wanted Booth to catch you

943
00:40:41,535 --> 00:40:44,870
so you and I wouldn't have
to be separated again.

944
00:40:47,473 --> 00:40:49,208
Smart guy, that Sweets.

I love you, honey.

946
00:40:50,643 --> 00:40:52,778
(Booth)
Thanks for leaving me
with the bill again.

947
00:40:52,812 --> 00:40:53,779
That's nice of you.

948
00:40:53,813 --> 00:40:54,780
Your fault, Booth.

949
00:40:54,814 --> 00:40:56,581
My wallet got
stolen in jail.

950
00:40:56,616 --> 00:40:57,816
Yeah.
Bye.

951
00:40:57,851 --> 00:41:00,284
Can't believe they
actually got hitched.

952
00:41:00,318 --> 00:41:02,686
(Brennan)
I know.

953
00:41:04,356 --> 00:41:07,524
I have this sense that
everything's changing, Booth.

954
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:09,526
Well, not everything.

955
00:41:09,561 --> 00:41:11,528
Look-- we're
still partners.

956
00:41:11,563 --> 00:41:12,596
Right?

957
00:41:12,631 --> 00:41:14,298
And-and Taffet...

958
00:41:14,332 --> 00:41:15,599
She's... she's put away.

959
00:41:15,634 --> 00:41:17,134
I mean, you're feeling good
about that, right?

960
00:41:17,168 --> 00:41:18,735
You almost died, Booth.

961
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:20,070
That can happen again.

962
00:41:20,104 --> 00:41:21,638
What if, next time,
I can't get to you?

963
00:41:21,672 --> 00:41:22,773
It's not going to happen again.

964
00:41:24,441 --> 00:41:29,679
I envy your ability to
substitute optimism for reality.

965
00:41:29,713 --> 00:41:31,014
You know what?

966
00:41:31,048 --> 00:41:33,182
Maybe you just need
to take some time off.

967
00:41:33,216 --> 00:41:34,516
Go to a beach.

968
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:35,885
Lay in the sun.

969
00:41:36,987 --> 00:41:39,655
I might need more
than a little time.

970
00:41:41,691 --> 00:41:43,959
Don't make any decisions
about your future right now.

971
00:41:43,994 --> 00:41:46,962
I'm just staying...
You know when a dentist
gives you anesthetic

972
00:41:46,997 --> 00:41:49,330
and tells you not to operate
any heavy machinery

973
00:41:49,364 --> 00:41:51,866
or make any important decisions
within 24 hours?

974
00:41:51,901 --> 00:41:53,501
All right, this case

975
00:41:53,535 --> 00:41:55,303
was bigger than a root canal.

976
00:41:55,337 --> 00:41:56,671
Come on, let's just
go back inside

977
00:41:56,705 --> 00:41:58,039
and have one more drink.
Come on.

978
00:41:58,073 --> 00:41:59,373
Just one.
No. I'm tired, Booth.

979
00:41:59,408 --> 00:42:01,342
I-I-I'm going to go home.

980
00:42:01,376 --> 00:42:02,576
(Sighs)
All right. Come on.

981
00:42:02,611 --> 00:42:04,377
Let's... we'll get you
in the cab.

982
00:42:04,412 --> 00:42:06,780
I know, it's... it's been
a long, long day.

983
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:09,082
All right, get in there,
all right?

984
00:42:09,117 --> 00:42:10,417
Hey.

985
00:42:10,451 --> 00:42:12,119
I'll see you tomorrow,
all right?

986
00:42:22,963 --> 00:42:26,933
