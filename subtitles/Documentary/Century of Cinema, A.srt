1
00:00:07,409 --> 00:00:09,040
Gosh, my cellphone.

2
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:12,009
I think I left it in the car.
I'll go get it.

3
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:29,399
Hey, he pulled the car and received
gifts from his fans yesterday.

4
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:30,530
Are you serious?

5
00:00:31,629 --> 00:00:33,170
Why didn't we go there yesterday?

6
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,129
I thought he'd drink all night long.

7
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:38,740
I mean, why do I always
not get to see him?

8
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,969
Even a passing dog sees him,
and I don't.

9
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:44,280
I hope I can see his face
at least once.

10
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:47,049
Why did it have to be
yesterday of all days?

11
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,020
It's all good.

12
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,829
We're all ready. We just
need Anthony to walk in now.

13
00:01:54,849 --> 00:01:55,950
Okay.

14
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,280
Go, go. Let's go.

15
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,500
- She's so pretty.
- She's really pretty.

16
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,710
Camera five, are you
getting the corner?

17
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,039
Yes, that's it.

18
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,419
(We Got Married)

19
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:31,550
Here you go.

20
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,530
(You are now a couple.)

21
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,159
(Come up with a sweet nickname
for each other.)

22
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,539
Do you want something? Coffee?

23
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,009
A soda? Or water?

24
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:08,419
I made him feel uncomfortable.

25
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:10,990
I should not. I'm remorseful.
Let's be careful.

26
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,789
What nicknames should we go for?

27
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:18,360
Shall we think about that?

28
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,879
People are saying you look nicer
than Rain and Kim Tae Hee.

29
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,150
I knew it.

30
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,449
You should exchange phone numbers,

31
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:44,389
get together with a beer
if you can, and get closer.

32
00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:46,060
For the sake of the show.

33
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,830
Sure. It was a long day.

34
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,729
- Great job.
- Bye.

35
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,229
What a downpour.

36
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:55,300
- See you for our next shoot.
- Okay, bye.

37
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,939
- Let's go.
- Well done today.

38
00:03:56,939 --> 00:03:58,539
Yes, thanks.

39
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:00,909
Jin Jin, can you wait here?

40
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:02,639
I'll get you an umbrella.

41
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,719
I'll walk you to your car.

42
00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:41,449
I love the smell of autumn rain.

43
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:53,829
Hello?

44
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,660
50,000 dollars?

45
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,069
Sure, I'll see what I can do.

46
00:05:00,829 --> 00:05:04,040
It's no trouble at all.
Did you skip dinner again?

47
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:08,209
- You'll get sick doing that.
- Jin Jin.

48
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,279
Just a moment.

49
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,779
Thanks.

50
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,449
Okay, take care of yourself.

51
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:50,980
Fess up while we're being nice.

52
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,160
Real friends celebrate
a friend's good news.

53
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,189
We're ready...

54
00:05:58,189 --> 00:06:00,230
to celebrate your great news.

55
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:01,629
Now fess up.

56
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,730
Stop grinning so hard.
What happened today? Tell us.

57
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,899
How dare you?

58
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,300
This won't do.

59
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:15,709
You evil witch. We shall punish you.

60
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,209
Fess up right now. Confess.

61
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:19,879
Confess. Tell us.

62
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,509
What happened today?

63
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:24,250
- Tell us or else.
- Stop! Stop it!

64
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,089
- Go on.
- I won't!

65
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:27,920
(The fifth story:
Everybody has secrets)

66
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,420
Tell us right now.

67
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:33,660
What was your first impression?

68
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,930
(Anthony's first impression?)

69
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,230
Jin Jin? What was
your first impression of him?

70
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:43,370
(Zoned out)

71
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,500
It was good to see her.

72
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:49,879
I watched her movies and dramas.

73
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:52,439
Jin Jin said she's been
a long-time fan of yours.

74
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:55,250
(Jin Jin is a long-time fan.)

75
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:59,550
Right. I'm always
thankful for my fans.

76
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,660
It's a secret, okay?
Keep it a secret.

77
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,459
That's it? It's nothing, really.

78
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:09,660
It's "We Got Married" with Anthony.

79
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:13,329
It's a virtual relationship.
It's not real. It's fake.

80
00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:15,829
Still, you never know
what will happen.

81
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:19,269
I love it.

82
00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:28,850
- Ji Won, let's play a game.
- I'll be right there.

83
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:06,490
(In 1999)

84
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,329
Who is this woman?

85
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,970
Don't call her that.
That's my mother.

86
00:08:25,899 --> 00:08:27,009
This is...

87
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:30,540
the only photo Anthony has
of him with his mom.

88
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,250
She died giving birth to him.

89
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:38,250
He never got to say "mom" to her.

90
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,519
Jin Jin.

91
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:42,389
- Look at this.
- What?

92
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:46,190
Her eyes and Anthony's
are the same, aren't they?

93
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:49,830
Jin Jin! Sa Jin Jin!

94
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,230
What?

95
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:09,779
You just redid your interior.

96
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:11,879
Our upstairs neighbor's
boiler exploded.

97
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:14,490
Oh, dear, your house must be a mess.

98
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:16,259
Come over to my place.

99
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:18,220
It's fine. I'm staying
at the house upstairs.

100
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,490
- Upstairs?
- Yes.

101
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,860
- It's my friend's place.
- Won't you feel uncomfortable?

102
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,659
It'll be fine.
We're really good friends.

103
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,340
Yes, that's right.

104
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,309
- With the parents.
- Still?

105
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,980
Your friend doesn't have a wife yet?

106
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,350
That new dye job really...

107
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,899
I'll call you back.

108
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:00,429
Sorry, I thought
you were my brother.

109
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:05,070
What are you doing here?

110
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:31,299
Sorry, I didn't know.
What should I do?

111
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:32,700
I don't care.

112
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,669
- Alone?
- Yes.

113
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,509
- Why? What about your...
- Come on, let's play a game.

114
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:42,509
Okay. I have a lot to say.
Let's take our time.

115
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:44,909
No. You can't talk to a pig.

116
00:10:45,309 --> 00:10:48,009
You play Real Madrid,
I'll play Barcelona. Deal?

117
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:51,019
- Deal.
- At last, I can play with a human.

118
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,820
- Are you good?
- I always played against the PC.

119
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,559
Here you go.

120
00:10:58,659 --> 00:10:59,929
There.

121
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,870
Don't look.
You'll ruin your eyesight.

122
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,539
You're such an embarrassment.
Aren't you ashamed?

123
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,210
Why should I feel ashamed?
We're friends,

124
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:19,679
- aren't we?
- Yes.

125
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,110
It's good to see her
eat so well after a long time.

126
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,279
I heard the construction
starts tomorrow.

127
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:27,649
While we're at it, we should get...

128
00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:29,250
the ceiling and
the walls redone too.

129
00:11:29,419 --> 00:11:33,129
I was going to do that.
There's a lot to tend to.

130
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,960
You don't have to mind it.
You can relax, my friend.

131
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,970
Thanks, my friend.

132
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,899
How did your first night go?

133
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,669
Remember this.

134
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,840
Your body is still like
that of an infant's.

135
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:51,379
My body is different from yours.

136
00:11:52,309 --> 00:11:53,580
I get it.

137
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:57,250
Right, Ji Won is
staying at my parents' place.

138
00:11:58,019 --> 00:11:59,850
His boiler ruptured,
so he's staying for a few days.

139
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,049
Why would he stay there?
It'll be uncomfortable.

140
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:04,559
Is his wife pretty?

141
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,799
He's here by himself.
There must be a long story.

142
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,899
He's full of stories.

143
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:13,929
You should ask him about that
while he's there.

144
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:15,970
Ask what?

145
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,100
You said you were
really conscious about that.

146
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:31,149
Do you have time?
It'll only take five minutes.

147
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:33,720
Sure.

148
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,029
Anyway, what is it?

149
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:50,370
I met this person for work,

150
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,110
and I have to be really close
with him, so I'm worried.

151
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,070
- Is it a guy?
- It's work.

152
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:57,710
What kind of smell do men like?

153
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,320
What do you think about this one?

154
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:08,649
It's okay.

155
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:09,759
Really?

156
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:15,129
What about this one?

157
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,299
This is okay too.

158
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,070
Okay.

159
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:45,820
Right, don't you
have to get to work?

160
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:49,899
- Oh, I should go.
- Right?

161
00:13:50,259 --> 00:13:51,399
I'm late.

162
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,899
- Goodbye.
- Okay, bye.

163
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:07,649
We must grow away from
our image as a latecomer.

164
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:09,649
By launching a new brand line,

165
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:13,519
we must emphasize the importance of
reaching the customers aggressively.

166
00:14:13,789 --> 00:14:16,620
How's the natural ingredient project
of India going?

167
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:20,929
India came up with a natural product
that fights insects and diseases.

168
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:23,929
We decided to make use of
the materials from Egypt.

169
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,200
This product has been tested
and confirmed for safety...

170
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,330
in Indonesia, Malaysia,
and Thailand as well.

171
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:30,769
Let's move on.

172
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,940
Kimchi?

173
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:35,570
You can eat it.
I don't eat kimchi anyway.

174
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,009
You should still
be considerate of Mother.

175
00:14:38,539 --> 00:14:39,879
Your passcode is the same, right?

176
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:46,950
Jin Jin, we're here.
I'll come up right now.

177
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,289
No, I'll be there.
I already walked out the door.

178
00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:58,960
Here. President Jang said you can
take time and look over them.

179
00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:02,730
Oh, and one of them is
Producer Choi's new project.

180
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,200
It's a blockbuster with
60 million dollars in budget.

181
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,070
Oh, my. Okay.

182
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:22,919
Something smells great.

183
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,190
I don't think it's coming from
you though.

184
00:16:27,049 --> 00:16:28,389
No, it's not me.

185
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,960
Oh, the actress lady
must've been here.

186
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,970
Hong Hee, I heard you were
visiting your parents.

187
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:47,940
You can give this to them.
And send them my regards.

188
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,809
It's for them, not you. Take it.

189
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:53,379
Thank you.

190
00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:00,389
Gosh, you don't look like the type,
but you're pretty considerate.

191
00:17:00,789 --> 00:17:02,149
Did you say
you have a younger brother?

192
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:03,860
You definitely seem
like the eldest daughter.

193
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,059
I'm the youngest daughter.
I have an older sister.

194
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:08,789
What? How come I never heard
that you have a sister?

195
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,630
I'll get going.

196
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,630
Jin Jin.

197
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:15,769
Take this.

198
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,839
It was buy 1 get 1 free.

199
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,109
You're a newlywed bride, so
you should take care of your skin.

200
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:21,640
I'm a model for a cosmetics company.

201
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:23,410
You can keep this
for yourself next time.

202
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,279
Bye.

203
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:28,250
Jin Jin, have this. Open your mouth.

204
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:32,349
- Bye, Jin Jin.
- Goodbye.

205
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:46,700
Do you live here?

206
00:17:52,099 --> 00:17:53,470
My brother lives here too.

207
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,039
My brother lives here too.

208
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,180
His brother?

209
00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:36,220
But he doesn't have a brother.

210
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,970
It looks like
you two will get married.

211
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,839
My gut feelings are always right.

212
00:18:58,339 --> 00:19:01,069
When you two get married,
I'll give you a huge present.

213
00:19:01,069 --> 00:19:02,940
Do you want a fridge?

214
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:12,950
Ms. Han, I'm sorry.
I should've told you before.

215
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,119
I didn't want this to happen.

216
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:18,819
Ji Hye, you are horrible at
reading between the lines.

217
00:19:19,589 --> 00:19:21,190
I was joking.

218
00:19:21,589 --> 00:19:23,829
I'm already 35.
Do you think I'm crazy?

219
00:19:24,259 --> 00:19:27,029
Look at her, she's so naive.

220
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:31,240
I know that. Like I said,
you had nothing to worry about.

221
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:35,539
Ms. Han, Ji Hye was
really worried about this.

222
00:19:35,869 --> 00:19:39,650
I told her numerous times
that you'd understand.

223
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:42,680
There's nothing to understand here.

224
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:46,049
Forget about that. Let's eat.

225
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:49,519
It's my treat today, so eat up.
Okay?

226
00:20:28,589 --> 00:20:30,529
Hey, you fool.

227
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,630
Me? I'm at
the riverside of Han River.

228
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,900
The riverside of Han River.

229
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,369
Try to find me if you can.

230
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,170
Am I at Yeouido? or Jamsil?

231
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:44,380
Where am I right now?
Let's grab a drink.

232
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,079
Hey, you're going to fall.

233
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:52,180
I need water.
I need more male energy!

234
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,519
I have enough.

235
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:57,019
- Let's go.
- Hey, hey.

236
00:20:57,019 --> 00:20:58,490
- I'm sorry.
- All right.

237
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,859
- This is great.
- Will you stay still?

238
00:21:01,089 --> 00:21:02,559
I'm the virgin ghost!

239
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,000
Let's go! I'll get you.

240
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,329
Will you please stop?

241
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,369
- Stop it.
- I'll get you!

242
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,539
Hey, you know,

243
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:14,740
- I lost weight once too.
- Sure.

244
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,180
- Oh, keep drinking.
- I did it.

245
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,910
I can be sexy too.

246
00:21:19,009 --> 00:21:21,809
Tall and sexy. Tall and sexy.

247
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,450
I can do it!

248
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:31,160
Tall and sexy. Tall and sexy.

249
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,660
Tall and sexy. Gosh, I'm tired.

250
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:42,799
Where are you going?

251
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:45,940
I'm going for a walk.

252
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,809
Again?

253
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,809
What?

254
00:21:54,809 --> 00:21:57,380
- Give me that. Let it go.
- No, no.

255
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:02,490
You told me to clean up my room.

256
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:04,720
I wanted to throw them away
on my way out.

257
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:07,829
Goodness.

258
00:22:07,829 --> 00:22:11,059
You might get a hole in your stomach
even before you get married.

259
00:22:11,059 --> 00:22:13,599
Stop drinking too much already.

260
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:16,700
Why would I drink if I was
going to drink only a little?

261
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:20,569
How did I give birth to
a brat like her?

262
00:22:20,569 --> 00:22:22,980
And my mom made me seaweed soup
she got from Wan Island...

263
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,009
for giving birth to
that troublemaker.

264
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,509
I'm so tired.

265
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:30,650
It's a delivery.

266
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,549
The resident of unit 1301
told me to put the package here.

267
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:35,220
(From your vitamin)

268
00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:43,900
Yes, my package is here.

269
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,630
It's Ji Won's.
I think his wife sent it to him.

270
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,470
What is she saying?

271
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:59,380
Ji Won, I came back safely
from my school field trip.

272
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:02,819
I used up all the pocket money
that you gave me.

273
00:23:02,819 --> 00:23:05,450
Enjoy your chocolate. With love.

274
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:08,319
Oh, right. I'm going to Seoul soon.

275
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:11,119
I'll let you go on a date with me.
Let's go eat delicious food.

276
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,690
- Is it the girl you talked about?
- Yes.

277
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:17,460
Right? I knew she was your sister.

278
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,900
Then why did Jin Jin say
such nonsense?

279
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:22,130
What?

280
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:25,569
She said you are married,
and your wife sent you this.

281
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:27,509
What?

282
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:37,380
- Alone?
- Yes.

283
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:41,990
- Why? What about your...
- Come on, let's play a game.

284
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:43,059
Okay.

285
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:52,730
Goodness.

286
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:58,440
Are you busy?

287
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,650
The gather of the Bongos.

288
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:12,079
The Bongos was established in 1999,

289
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:14,589
but its earliest beginning goes back
to 1983, the year of our births.

290
00:24:14,589 --> 00:24:16,859
It's the social gathering
with a long history.

291
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:19,089
We didn't have you for 17 years,

292
00:24:19,089 --> 00:24:21,259
but staring today,
we'll be complete again.

293
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:23,130
Our main job is to have
fried chicken.

294
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:26,569
Koreans have a total of
80 million chickens a year.

295
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:29,500
The Bongos is contributing
a lot to it.

296
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:33,509
What I mean is that the Bongos
is a very healthy gathering.

297
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,069
So...

298
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:40,079
Tell your wife not to be mistaken
about our relationship.

299
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:41,480
She absolutely...

300
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:44,720
doesn't need to.

301
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:49,660
Men and women can't be friends as
long as there are drinks and nights?

302
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,190
That's ridiculous.

303
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:55,660
We're friends.
We're just best friends.

304
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,829
Who said that?

305
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,930
Okay, we're just friends,
not best friends.

306
00:25:12,339 --> 00:25:15,109
Who said that I was married?

307
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,970
I'm not married.

308
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:49,450
Let's not spread false rumors.

309
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:05,099
- You're not married?
- No.

310
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,869
Not even once?

311
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:11,299
- How about wedding...
- Quiet.

312
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:13,539
I almost got married.

313
00:26:14,109 --> 00:26:16,180
Then you called off...

314
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,710
Quiet.

315
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:22,650
Let's leave the past behind.

316
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,880
What?

317
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:26,420
We won't ask about your past.

318
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:29,460
- Let's make it clear first.
- What?

319
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:32,660
We've never dated anyone before.
And we don't have boyfriends.

320
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:36,700
Then I'll make it clear too.
Make what clear?

321
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,099
I'm not dating anyone now.

322
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:41,730
That's great. That's perfect.

323
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:44,839
- Then let's settle it within here.
- Settle what?

324
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:47,210
I hate to admit it,

325
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:50,410
but objectively speaking, he's okay.

326
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:53,109
It's hard to meet someone
as handsome as he is.

327
00:26:53,109 --> 00:26:55,480
And we don't want him
to date other girls either.

328
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,750
You're right about that.

329
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:59,220
So choose one among us.

330
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,019
Date one of us.

331
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:04,059
Choose one. Who do you want?

332
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,460
- Among you three?
- Yes.

333
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:18,839
Of course, it's you, Young Shim.

334
00:27:21,869 --> 00:27:24,140
I missed you every day.

335
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:33,349
Why do we have to do this?

336
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,990
It's obviously you,

337
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:37,420
Ah Reum.

338
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,470
What? You're not
getting nervous, are you?

339
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,779
I'm more nervous than you.

340
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:04,380
I missed you, my Jin Jin.

341
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:21,900
What's there to think?

342
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,700
I choose Jin Jin.

343
00:28:26,809 --> 00:28:27,970
Why?

344
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,240
She's my first love.

345
00:28:35,109 --> 00:28:36,319
Your first love?

346
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:38,980
First love, my foot.

347
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:41,190
You think I don't know?

348
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:45,660
- What?
- You're after her money.

349
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:48,029
You're such a scumbag.

350
00:28:48,029 --> 00:28:50,630
Where on earth did you go
that you're being like this?

351
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:55,369
Right. Where did you go?

352
00:28:55,369 --> 00:28:57,839
- We looked everywhere for you.
- Right.

353
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:04,609
Didn't I tell you?

354
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,420
It's pouring down.

355
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:12,119
- Goodness.
- It's raining so hard.

356
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:13,720
Why is it raining so hard?

357
00:29:14,089 --> 00:29:15,950
I hate it when it's cold.

358
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,960
It's terrible.
Hey, let's take the shortcut.

359
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,990
Okay.

360
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,660
Get home safely.
It was nice to see you.

361
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,759
Bye.

362
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:25,430
- Bye.
- Hold the umbrella.

363
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,750
How old is your brother?

364
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:50,890
- He's three years older than me.
- I see.

365
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:54,289
- And your sister is a junior?
- Yes.

366
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,660
- She must be so cute.
- She's cute.

367
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:03,640
You were cute too when you
were a junior in high school.

368
00:30:35,769 --> 00:30:38,539
(Sa Jin Jin)

369
00:30:42,569 --> 00:30:43,680
But...

370
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:46,450
why did we do it then?

371
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,920
What do you mean?

372
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,950
Why...

373
00:30:55,289 --> 00:30:56,920
did we break up?

374
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:11,369
Don't you really remember?

375
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,910
No, I don't. What is it?

376
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:14,910
Forget it.

377
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:17,539
I'll just ask the others then.

378
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:20,180
Are you crazy?
They don't know we dated.

379
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,210
Why not?

380
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:24,220
- Because it's a secret.
- A secret?

381
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:27,019
Yes, so don't tell them
until the day you die.

382
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:29,819
I refuse.

383
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,019
You want to die?

384
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,730
How could you say such a thing
as an actress?

385
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:38,230
Anyway, don't tell them.

386
00:31:39,829 --> 00:31:42,069
- I refuse.
- Stop it.
