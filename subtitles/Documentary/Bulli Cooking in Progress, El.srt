2
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,235
Okay, class.

3
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:12,407
Class, it's time for the presentations
on personal heroes.

4
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:15,611
So, you're up, George.

5
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:20,015
- Class, quiet.
- My inspiration is basketball.

6
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:25,353
I went to a basketball camp and they
made us practice for six hours a day.

7
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:29,991
This is a picture of Kobe,
because I wanna be like him.

8
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,533
Thank you, George.

9
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:41,808
Okay.

10
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:48,141
Ansiedad Gutierrez?

11
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:55,183
Everyone, please reach under your seats
and locate your 3D glasses.

12
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:56,884
Jenna, lights.

13
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:58,189
And now,

14
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:01,094
a few words about
someone truly inspirational.

15
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:02,766
My mother.

16
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,963
My mother's Christian name is Altagracia.

17
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,696
The white man can't pronounce that,
so she goes by Grace,

18
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:10,808
which her parents can't pronounce.

19
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:13,408
This is the menu at her second job.

20
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,309
- She met her last boyfriend there.
- Emile's.

21
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:18,082
Grace has dated firemen, auto mechanics,

22
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:20,479
bakers, barbers,
professional chess players,

23
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:22,484
and the kind of astronauts
that never go into space.

24
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,122
Eventually, they break up.

25
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,723
And when they do,
we move to another town.

26
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:29,752
You know, I think that's enough.

27
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,386
Here are some of
the iconic places we didn't visit

28
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,431
while living in these respective cities.

29
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:36,262
We've been in Seattle almost a year

30
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:38,836
- and I still haven't seen this place.
- Overrated.

31
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:41,997
Why? 'Cause she's now
dating a gynaecologist,

32
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,097
who, by the way, is married.

33
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:48,141
Bottom line, she inspires me
to be nothing like her.

34
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:52,473
Oh, yeah, and this question mark right here
represents my father.

35
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,673
Jenna, lights.

36
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,616
Thank you all for coming.

37
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:07,497
It's not the first time she's been in here.

38
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:10,561
I'm thinking about
putting her on suspension.

39
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:12,035
Suspension?

40
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,002
Which could put your
daughter's scholarship at risk.

41
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:17,199
No, no, no. I will talk to her.

42
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:19,299
I got this, Mr. Principal.

43
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:28,051
- Guaterrier.
- Gualtiery.

44
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:29,514
Gualiterry.

45
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:31,789
Gualtiery.

46
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:41,229
- She's threatening to beat me.
- Is that true?

47
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,162
She likes to embellish.

48
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:45,429
She swore on her mother.

49
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,127
See? Embellish.

50
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:49,168
She just learned that word on TV.

51
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:54,169
So help me, I will set you on fire, girl.

52
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:55,610
Please do.

53
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,238
Why?

54
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:58,782
Why now?

55
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,579
- Why now what?
- Why now are you being so impossible?

56
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,689
I'm a teen named Anxiety.

57
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:06,984
How many times do
we have to go through this?

58
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:10,025
That was my grandmother's name.
That's a beautiful name.

59
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:12,221
That woman was a saint.

60
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:14,992
- Whose car is this anyway?
- Becky's. And listen.

61
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,568
I'm not going to take
any more crap from you, okay?

62
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:21,628
Just so we're clear, for the next two days,
you bus tables at the Shack.

63
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:24,708
- Don't give me that face.
- Why?

64
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,000
Why? Because I'm an adult.

65
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:30,237
And you're a kid,
and you do as I say, that's why.

66
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,442
Can we give Tavita a ride?

67
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:38,018
Hello, how's my daughter's only friend?

68
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:40,420
- Mom.
- I'm good.

69
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,428
- I loved our presentation.
- Can you not smoke?

70
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,328
It's cancerous.

71
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:50,100
I'm sorry your child has no father,
Mrs. Gutierrez.

72
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,603
And I'm sorry that you have to
work two jobs to support her.

73
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:55,737
I'm sure if you would
have married that chef,

74
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:58,434
you guys would have had
wonderful dinners every night.

75
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,675
- Thanks for the ride.
- This is your house?

76
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:05,582
It's like a coliseum.

77
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:08,208
Go, Tavita. Enjoy your nuclear family.

78
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:10,345
- Bye.
- Bye.

79
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:13,219
Now she's adorable, but she
needs to work on her fashion sense.

80
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,350
Maybe you can help her with that,
because that hair band thing...

81
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:18,258
Please don't make fun of her. Thank you.

82
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,508
Lower that, please!

83
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:16,109
Some of us are trying
not to be such immigrants!

84
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,155
Are some of us trying to do our chores?

85
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:20,918
Some of us have homework.

86
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:23,224
Excuses, excuses.

87
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:25,888
This side or this side?

88
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,346
I got suspended, Brad.

89
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:17,947
How do you feel about that?

90
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:19,380
I think that's terrible

91
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:22,242
I think it's weird that
you're a boy gynaecologist.

92
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:23,916
You can think that.

93
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:26,723
How's the wife?

94
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,250
How's your father?

95
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:33,295
Water the plant, go to bed at some point,

96
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:36,128
and don't call me,
if I am running late, I will call you.

97
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:38,224
They're beautiful.

98
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,236
You hate tulips.

99
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,197
Water. Vase.

100
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:49,705
Tick-tock.

101
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,841
This can't wait.

102
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,478
Don't wait up.

103
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:42,887
Okay, here we go.

104
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:47,160
Okay, now the crab vindaloo
will be another 15 minutes,

105
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:48,629
but it's so worth it.

106
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,699
Okay? Okay.

107
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,361
Oh, more mussels. I'm sorry,
I'll get right on that.

108
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,663
Two crab balls. One beaver tail.

109
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,435
Three fatty bays, all the way to stay.

110
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:01,302
Where's your little girl?

111
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:03,739
Oh, I don't know.

112
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:08,947
Welcome to Emile's Crab Shack.
Something to drink?

113
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:11,448
Okay, good.

114
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:13,614
But you have to be
a little bit more energetic.

115
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,715
You want people to have to
come into this restaurant

116
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:18,022
and request for you to be their waiter.

117
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,597
- So just be more, you know, upbeat.
- Okay.

118
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:24,127
Hi, welcome to Emile's Crab Shack.
Something to drink?

119
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,233
Very good. Okay, good. Okay.

120
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:29,700
Now let's move on to the items on the menu.

121
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:30,899
Start right here.

122
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:34,470
- Soft sell.
- Soft shell.

123
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:37,344
- Soft shell crabs.
- Yes, good.

124
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,312
Soft, like your mother.

125
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,914
Like your mother's kiss.

126
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:43,611
I'm learning.

127
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:45,655
Ansiedad.

128
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:47,615
Tables don't clear themselves.

129
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:49,226
I'm teaching Mission Impossible to read.

130
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:51,760
Hey, I'll do it.

131
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,793
No. No, no, no.

132
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:55,763
She will do it. She needs to learn.

133
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:58,927
- I'll teach you when I get back.
- Okay.

134
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:01,197
Stop calling him that. It's gonna stick.

135
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,863
Hey, Mission Impossible.

136
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,474
I've got a delivery for you.

137
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:06,406
And clean up before you get there.

138
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,809
Grace, I need to talk to you in the office.

139
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,545
Can you guess what I'm about to say?

140
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,052
No.

141
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:19,850
Crab Masters.

142
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,059
I've been invited to Crab Fest.

143
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,626
Do you know what that is?

144
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,290
It is the Oscars of crabs.

145
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:31,834
It is the Wimbledon,
it is the Heavyweight Championship.

146
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:33,232
And they've invited me.

147
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,861
They have no idea what they're in for.

148
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,169
My King Crab Masala is going to
make the judges crap their pants.

149
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:40,708
But it occurs to me, out
of the three of you,

150
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,280
I don't have a prime candidate
to run my restaurant.

151
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:45,544
Olga, you're too old.

152
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:46,844
Screw you.

153
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:49,749
- Becky, your husband beats you.
- What?

154
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,511
Grace, you're my secret weapon.

155
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:54,848
But you can be a big flake sometimes.

156
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:57,419
So here's what we're gonna do.

157
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,220
A contest?

158
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:03,156
Yeah. To see who's more responsible.

159
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:05,667
That's inhumane.
How do we even measure that?

160
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:07,431
Ansiedad, it doesn't matter.

161
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:09,733
What matters is, I'm going to win it.

162
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:12,241
You know how Emile's always talking about
if he had somebody to run it,

163
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:13,833
he'd open up a second place?

164
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:16,379
Well, that somebody could be me.

165
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,209
Okay, but what about night school?

166
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,416
What about night school?

167
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:24,887
Remember how you told me
you were going back to school?

168
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:29,488
Web design, working for Bill Gates,
I mean, isn't that why we moved here?

169
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,260
Don't you see how
this is an opportunity for me

170
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:35,263
to show some real responsibility?

171
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,402
Actually, I do.

172
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:42,067
- Hi.
- Hey.

173
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:44,637
Would the ladies like a ride?

174
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:46,901
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Come on.

175
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:48,444
Okay, where you... Okay.

176
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:50,772
Okay.

177
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:53,910
- Really? Hang on. Hang on.
- Hold on. Yeah.

178
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:57,745
Oh, my goodness.

179
00:12:58,744 --> 00:12:59,916
What are we doing tonight?

180
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:02,151
Ansiedad, get in the car, right now.

181
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:29,415
Can anyone tell me what
a coming of age story is?

182
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,613
Are any of you familiar with that term?

183
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:37,216
All right. A coming of age story

184
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:42,289
is the story of a young person's
inner change from child to adult,

185
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:45,294
and the transformative journey
that brings about that change.

186
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:50,499
In other words, think of it as a template
for leaving your childhood behind.

187
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,476
Think of these stories as a haunted house.

188
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,740
One full of stuff so horrifying,

189
00:13:57,403 --> 00:14:00,316
that a kid goes in one end
innocent and naive,

190
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:04,521
and comes out the other side profoundly
changed from the experience itself.

191
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:06,589
HOW?

192
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,960
How do the characters
leave their childhood behind?

193
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,224
Like, if they hate it? Like, if it sucks?

194
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:19,528
By taking on the traditional
challenges of adolescence.

195
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:22,999
Those challenges are called
rites of passage.

196
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:27,637
They're like unwanted,
but necessary stops on the highway

197
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,802
to adulthood and independence.

198
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:32,411
I want you all to write this down.

199
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:34,984
Rites of passage.

200
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,324
I'm coming of age, Tavita.

201
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,263
What does that mean?

202
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,671
It means, being a kid is stupid,

203
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,135
and I'm moving on.

204
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:32,766
But I need your help.

205
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,913
Film and television have cornered
the market of coming of age stories.

206
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:42,645
There are many varieties,
but the kind we're concerned with

207
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:44,778
employs the "good girl gone bad" model.

208
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,621
You taking notes?

209
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,821
- Yes.
- Here we go.

210
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,964
First, we establish me
as a sweet, straight-arrow kid.

211
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:58,900
You know, the kind who gets bullied
in cafeterias and locker rooms

212
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:00,595
and hangs out with unpopular girls.

213
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:02,405
Okay.

214
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:05,668
To reinforce my nerditude,
I do something geeky,

215
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:09,177
like become a cello prodigy.

216
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:13,044
- But you don't play cello.
- Well, then I'll play chess.

217
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:16,814
Around this time I get a teacher
to admire what a good student I am.

218
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:18,684
Very nerd.

219
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,622
I will later disappoint
her by losing my way

220
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:25,457
once I start hanging with

221
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:27,389
the wrong crowd.

222
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:29,865
I'll befriend a bad girl.

223
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:32,492
And learn from her
how to become dark and rebellious.

224
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:36,801
And do terrible things like cut
class, steal, and possibly drugs.

225
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:41,304
But more importantly,
because bad girls go to bad girl parties.

226
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,846
And who else goes to bad girl parties?

227
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:46,843
<i>Bad boys</i>

228
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:48,607
I don't follow.

229
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:51,415
In coming of age stories
there's always a party.

230
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:54,418
The kind with drunkenness,
where virginities are lost,

231
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,618
and that's where I'll lose mine.

232
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:59,888
To the baddest,
most insensitive guy around.

233
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:02,156
You're going to have sex?

234
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:05,361
Copulation, or sex, as you call it,

235
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:07,937
specifically the loss of female virginity

236
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,201
has been the rite of passage
for girls turning into women since

237
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,001
maybe before the beginning of time.

238
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,678
Metamorphosis, Tavita.

239
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:20,909
<i>The point of no return.
It's how we get our wings</i>

240
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,319
I'm hungry...

241
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:25,317
So now I'm free to fly.

242
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:29,323
And I hop on a bus to Adult-ville.

243
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:35,192
<i>My coming of age story is complete.</i>

244
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:37,994
Roll end credits.
Bring up the house lights.

245
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,933
I'm not a kid any more.

246
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,500
And I leave her behind.

247
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,808
Which brings us to the last piece.

248
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,612
The last piece.

249
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:53,917
To cement maturity,

250
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:57,681
I'll need to experience something tragic,
like a brush with death.

251
00:17:57,943 --> 00:18:00,219
Represented here by
the Greek demon Thanatos,

252
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:01,920
who's kind of a jerk.

253
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:05,094
What do you mean by death?

254
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:09,688
By the way, I'll need to borrow your sister's
bike to establish my plucky innocence.

255
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:26,181
Hello, Mrs. Gilmore.

256
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:36,954
Hi. I need a grandma.

257
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:41,492
I was thinking someone wheelchair-bound
that I can share poignant moments with

258
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:44,966
and tell secrets to, and someone
who's a good candidate for dying.

259
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,047
- You work here, don't you?
- Yes. So?

260
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:02,376
I have a business proposition for you.

261
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,454
Nurse Gilliam.

262
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,521
I don't do birthdays.

263
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,288
Which one is she?

264
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,831
There she is.

265
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:24,068
Hi.

266
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:26,636
Can you talk?

267
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,847
Perfect. You don't know me.

268
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:35,443
My name is Ansiedad and I'm casting you
as my sick, dying grandma.

269
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,184
What's your name?

270
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:42,383
Maude. I'm going to call you Maude,
is that okay, Maude?

271
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,628
These are for you.

272
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:48,865
This is only happening
because he makes more money than I do.

273
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:54,536
How can he get custody of her
without anyone even talking to me?

274
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:57,672
Listen, I got to call you back.

275
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:00,374
Students can't just walk in here.

276
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,740
I know. Sorry.

277
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:06,372
I'm just here because I need
someone to recognize my potential

278
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:08,314
and watch helplessly as
I throw it all away.

279
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:16,259
Welcome to the team!

280
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:18,692
Thank you, fellow nerd.

281
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,709
It's all set.

282
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:41,173
Sorry I finished the cereal.

283
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,846
And the milk.

284
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,693
The dishes?

285
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:59,993
When I get back. But please know,
I'm gonna start not doing those.

286
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,073
I'm sorry?

287
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:06,907
As a sign.

288
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:09,138
We've already established
that chores are something I do,

289
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:12,748
so my not doing them
will be an early indicator.

290
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:15,917
I'd explain, but I'm sure you have to go.
I know I do.

291
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:27,325
Sol invited Grace to my chess tournament.

292
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:28,454
You think she'll show up?

293
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:29,861
Hey.

294
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:30,956
Hey.

295
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:35,034
Ferguson, this is my friend Ansiedad.

296
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:36,839
What kinda name is that?

297
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:38,898
Can we talk?

298
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:45,142
Ferguson?

299
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:47,410
We just met. He's all right.

300
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:52,017
He's weird.
He looks like he keeps guns in his locker.

301
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,612
You're weird.

302
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,883
Fine. You have my breakdown?

303
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:00,021
- Yes.
- Okay.

304
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:03,162
I hacked into
a popular girl's Facebook page.

305
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:08,271
If you wanna get in with the wrong crowd, you
have to impress Valerie Lipniki. Period!

306
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:12,335
But nothing impresses Valerie Lipniki.

307
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:15,708
Now look down and to your left.
That's Trevor Morgan.

308
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:17,580
The one with the cast?

309
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,650
Chick magnet.
Chews 'em up and spits 'em out.

310
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,747
That's your bad boy.
And he goes to every party.

311
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,685
So he's probably going to this one.

312
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,627
It's in three weeks,
and you can't just show up.

313
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:33,858
Right.

314
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:37,593
So, I need Valerie Lipniki to get me in.

315
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:40,260
And Trevor Morgan to deflower me.

316
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,673
Good work, Tavita.

317
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:45,838
- You're the best.
- Thanks.

318
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:48,300
Wait. Where you going?

319
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,911
To get the bad girl's attention.

320
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:00,848
She's acting strange.

321
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:02,887
Who?

322
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:04,392
Ansiedad.

323
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:07,122
You mean stranger?

324
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:09,992
Why? You think she's strange?

325
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:11,467
No.

326
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:18,538
I guess she is a little weird.

327
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,976
We would've kicked her ass
in my high school.

328
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:27,112
If I would've gone to high school.

329
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:35,285
I should be out there getting a degree,

330
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,289
not laying here with some married man.

331
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:41,193
Barely married.

332
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:43,766
Married enough. Oh, gosh!

333
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:45,931
No. No!

334
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:49,501
No, why? So your wife can drive up?

335
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,574
She's not gonna drive up.
She's running errands.

336
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:54,842
Oh, damn it!

337
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:58,371
Hurry.

338
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:07,851
Okay.

339
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,071
Hey, you're home early.

340
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:27,700
Your son has migraines again.

341
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,979
Amazingly they haven't gotten better

342
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:32,446
by you choosing to ignore them.

343
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,359
Still here, Grace?

344
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:55,866
Oh, yeah. Yes, ma'am.

345
00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:00,205
Come get me when you're done,
I'll drive you home, okay?

346
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,474
Okay.

347
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:12,477
How's your little girl?

348
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:13,715
Good.

349
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,317
Not making any trouble?

350
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:17,392
No. No.

351
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:19,152
She's a good kid.

352
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:21,624
It must be hard without a father.

353
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:28,630
We won't be needing you
at the house any more, Grace.

354
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:33,373
I'm paying you an extra day,
and I can recommend you, but that's it.

355
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,945
I'm sorry.

356
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:39,648
It was Dr. Harford's decision.

357
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:49,353
You put this in my locker?

358
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:52,461
- That's right.
- Why?

359
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,096
Because I wanna be like you.

360
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:55,764
One of you gulls...

361
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:57,731
The note says you can get alcohol.

362
00:25:57,822 --> 00:25:59,665
You think I can't?

363
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:02,130
You chess nerd?

364
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,803
I wanna be like you.

365
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:07,409
That's funny.

366
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,876
And what? And what?

367
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:16,984
You dress like a retard.

368
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:21,819
She said you dress like a retard?

369
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:24,894
Yes! So you can have
your clothes back now.

370
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:32,001
All right. We are on to phase two.

371
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,970
I'll want a more mature look.
Something that screams,

372
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:38,769
"I wanna belong!"
Noted here under Slutwear.

373
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:44,780
Wait. There's a card missing.

374
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:47,406
No.

375
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,588
Fine.

376
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,990
Here. It fell.

377
00:26:58,183 --> 00:27:01,392
Tavita, you can't change how things go.

378
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:04,261
I know. I just thought that one was stupid.

379
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:06,468
It's not.

380
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:10,863
Look, in coming of age stories

381
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,033
there's times when you have
to ignore your best friend

382
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,735
for dangerous new ones.

383
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:20,143
We can't be seen in public any more soon.

384
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:21,649
But first,

385
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,949
I'm gonna need you to approach me when I'm
near Valerie, so I can ignore you coldly.

386
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:26,553
Okay.

387
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:29,787
That or I'll make fun of you.

388
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:31,155
And then when no one's looking,

389
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:33,160
I'll wink to let you know we're okay.

390
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:34,628
Like this.

391
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,694
You know what? You're right.

392
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:45,135
This one's stupid.

393
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,807
We don't have to do this one.
So, what's next?

394
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:52,879
"Steal Money for Makeover."

395
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:02,725
- Hello.
- Hey, it's me.

396
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:03,992
Don't hang up.

397
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:07,322
Gracey, please, just talk to me.

398
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:09,793
I don't understand...

399
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:47,964
I'm sorry, I have to win.

400
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:49,834
Checkmate.

401
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:52,001
Checkmate.

402
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:05,352
Okay, ladies, pay attention!

403
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:07,480
Responsibilithon update.

404
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:10,353
If we're going by most tips,
Grace, you're in the lead.

405
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:11,786
Congratulations.

406
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,426
Becky, least amount of complaints,
that's you.

407
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:15,622
- Really?
- Yeah.

408
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:18,733
And, Olga, you forfeited everything

409
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:21,497
by spitting in a customer's food
in front of the customer.

410
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:23,862
I'm sorry, he deserved that.

411
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:26,340
Now listen, you,
wives have a problem with you.

412
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,207
Just tone it down a little bit.
I'm not saying get rid of it.

413
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:31,538
Lord knows they're not coming here
for the food all the time.

414
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:33,273
All right. Just be mindful.
That's all I'm saying.

415
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:34,349
Got it, boss.

416
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,816
Mission!

417
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:37,079
Go empty the trash!

418
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:40,251
Do to the trash
what your ex-girlfriend did to you.

419
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:41,688
Dump it!

420
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:55,832
No.

421
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:33,065
Thank you. But I already ate.

422
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:35,506
Burgers and fries, our favourite.

423
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,273
Greasy, extra greasy.

424
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:41,047
Extra, extra greasy!

425
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,614
Fine!

426
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:46,154
I'll just eat them all by myself!
I can do it.

427
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:47,823
See if I care!

428
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:55,193
Oh, God! Doesn't scholarship mean free?

429
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:03,235
I need six more jobs.

430
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:13,343
Ansiedad!

431
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:19,851
Ansiedad!

432
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:30,626
Why is the door locked?

433
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:36,828
What are you doing?

434
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:39,835
Rehearsing for my
blasting death metal phase.

435
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:42,178
Unless hip-hop freaks you out more.

436
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:43,974
This freaks me out.

437
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:45,672
Great.

438
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:52,713
What happened to your teddies?

439
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:55,153
I decapitated them.

440
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,356
Grow up.

441
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:02,955
I'm trying.

442
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:04,192
Mom?

443
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:06,334
Yes?

444
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:11,031
Did you win that?

445
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:13,174
In chess.

446
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:15,807
How nerdy.

447
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:20,843
I'm happy you have
something you like to do after school.

448
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:23,485
Mom?

449
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:25,587
Yes?

450
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:30,425
You say you're tired
as a half hearted excuse for not noticing.

451
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,924
I am tired, baby.

452
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:40,464
I'm really, really tired.

453
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:44,032
Fine.

454
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:54,744
Why aren't kids allowed
to use the school elevator?

455
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:56,250
Because kids are animals.

456
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:58,651
Now, can we talk about your homework?

457
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:01,883
You should be amazed
I even show up for class.

458
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:05,524
My mother never finished high school.

459
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:07,357
She keeps saying
she's gonna go to night school

460
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:09,056
but she never will.

461
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,564
How old is your mother?

462
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:13,829
She was 17 when I ruined the party.
And then she had to leave home

463
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:16,838
'cause her mom wouldn't have her around
with yours truly.

464
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:19,237
Your grandma sounds tough.

465
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:20,598
I guess.

466
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:24,478
Are you trying out a new look?

467
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:29,011
You can tell?

468
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:30,678
What are you wearing?

469
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,219
It's Ferguson's.

470
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:34,389
We're going out. My mom doesn't know.

471
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:35,623
Hey!

472
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:38,049
So, some of us are hanging out tonight.

473
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,959
My mom's away
and I have keys to her gallery.

474
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:43,822
I was thinking that if you're still
down to help us

475
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:46,629
with that stuff you said you could get,

476
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:49,136
you'd be really hooking us up.

477
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:54,309
Are you out of your mind?
I'm not buying you liquor.

478
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:56,342
It's bad enough I let you in here!

479
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:57,571
Tell him it's important, Maude.

480
00:33:57,668 --> 00:33:59,614
Hey, let me be straight with you.

481
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,581
You're only here seeing your "grandma,"

482
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,686
because your grandma gets no visits.

483
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:06,987
Now, you coming by is doing her good.

484
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,116
Well, can I have the bottle
you keep in your back pocket?

485
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:12,388
Get out!

486
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:16,595
Bye, Maude.

487
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:23,772
Mission.

488
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,200
I need your help.

489
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:29,572
Do you know what today is?

490
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:31,602
Thursday?

491
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:34,909
Actually, it's Friday.
But it's also my mother's birthday.

492
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:37,485
Really?

493
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:39,383
You should buy her a present.

494
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:42,914
Like what?

495
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:44,424
Tequila.

496
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:47,462
Which I will hand-deliver
at just the right surprising moment

497
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:49,395
with a bow and a note.

498
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,578
She's here.

499
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:09,410
Oh, my God! You did it!

500
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:12,615
Awesome! Thanks.

501
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:34,167
I like your cast.

502
00:35:34,398 --> 00:35:35,809
Thank you.

503
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:37,271
It's very clean.

504
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:39,881
Yeah. I don't let people write on it.

505
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:41,242
I know what you mean.

506
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,048
Trevor.

507
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:49,988
Trevor's here, everyone.

508
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:52,254
And the party starts.

509
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:57,223
Go play with your fat buddy, little girl.

510
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:09,605
Okay.

511
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,369
I'm sitting here.

512
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:13,405
You're so not.

513
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:15,911
Hall passes.

514
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,445
- Oh, my God!
- I got a ton.

515
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:19,711
Yeah, right.

516
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:21,652
Fine.

517
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:25,124
Wait.

518
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:28,456
What's your name?

519
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:30,665
Anne.

520
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:33,364
Where'd you get hall passes, Anne?

521
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,064
For me to know.

522
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:37,572
Okay.

523
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:40,006
You can sit here.

524
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:41,843
But the hippo's gotta go.

525
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:45,314
What the hell are you looking at?

526
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:47,639
You got enough chins?

527
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:50,043
Do I look like a meal to you?

528
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,448
Leave her alone.

529
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:55,657
I mean,

530
00:36:57,114 --> 00:36:58,252
look at her,

531
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,891
she's a fat blob.

532
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:05,092
The school has to reinforce her lunch tray.

533
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:07,226
And her boyfriend's Ferguson.

534
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:09,566
- The flea packer?
- Yeah.

535
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:13,437
And her mom's a big alchie
who drinks all her father's money.

536
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:15,135
And she dresses like a retard,

537
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:17,779
because she is a retard.

538
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:21,078
Get out of my chair.

539
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:24,312
Come sit. We have so much to talk about.

540
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,480
I absolutely love your hair.

541
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,888
- I should totally wear it like this sometime.
- Gorgeous. Yeah.

542
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:31,426
I mean, what is this style?

543
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,550
You want some gum?

544
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:06,154
Thanks.

545
00:38:14,258 --> 00:38:16,397
So, have you heard about
the blackout party?

546
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:22,171
Two crazy crab salads, two crabby chowders
and one fatty bay all the way to stay.

547
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:25,172
Got that, Lo Mein?

548
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:27,408
Why not anyone call me chef?

549
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:29,178
Just say chef!

550
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:31,386
Damn it!

551
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:36,653
Hey, you okay?

552
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:38,784
Becky just quit.

553
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:40,920
She had a fight with a flight of stairs.

554
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,495
That leaves you to run the restaurant.

555
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:46,124
You're not ready.

556
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,069
That means I can't go to Crab Masters.

557
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:52,238
- I can do it.
- Do what?

558
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,769
I can run this place. I've done it before.

559
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:56,208
Where?

560
00:38:56,334 --> 00:39:01,408
Memphis. Rib joint. Fifty tables
I managed lunch.

561
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:03,245
All me.

562
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:07,485
Come on. Come on, I got your back.

563
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:09,314
You go get that Crab Oscar.

564
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:14,090
Grace, don't make me look like a fool.

565
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:16,397
I promise.

566
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:23,696
Mission, come here.

567
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:26,434
Give me this. Take this.

568
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:30,410
You're serving tables now.
Look presentable, would you?

569
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:43,851
Hi!

570
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:47,452
Welcome to Emile's Crab Shack.
Something to drink?

571
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:53,432
What happened?

572
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:56,027
My wife came home and said you quit.

573
00:39:57,695 --> 00:40:00,073
I think about your wife sometimes.

574
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:04,511
- She made me coffee in that fancy...
- Expobar.

575
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:05,876
Yeah.

576
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:16,086
You know, seeing you lying sideways
like that, I'm thinking,

577
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:21,696
that's something I want
to see every morning.

578
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,093
I'm going to tell her.

579
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,630
I don't believe you.

580
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:33,872
So don't believe me.

581
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:37,139
We need to stop.

582
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:39,475
So we should stop.

583
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,897
You look pretty.

584
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:05,005
Hey! No, "Good morning"?
No, "What are you making?"

585
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:11,209
I'm making chilaquiles.

586
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:14,644
I hate chilaquiles.

587
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:16,308
Since when?

588
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:20,787
Since I realized you only make them to
avoid talking about your latest 'tard move.

589
00:41:21,278 --> 00:41:22,313
My latest what?

590
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:27,256
'Tard move, Grace.
It's when you do something retarded.

591
00:41:27,351 --> 00:41:29,331
Like taking a married man back.

592
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:34,468
Don't talk to me like that.

593
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:38,337
I'm out of control. Catch you later.

594
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:56,850
Hey.

595
00:41:57,414 --> 00:41:58,791
I got invited.

596
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:03,257
Are you okay?

597
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:06,392
- Hey, Tee, I don't have all day.
- I'm coming.

598
00:42:11,128 --> 00:42:12,436
What are those?

599
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:14,439
Nothing.

600
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,177
Skinny pills.

601
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:23,051
- I'm halfway down my list.
- Hey, Tee.

602
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:25,175
All I need is a Trevor and it's over.

603
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,780
Wonder what you're gonna do for that.

604
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:30,552
Too bad you don't have
another friend to betray.

605
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:31,956
Let's go!

606
00:42:38,155 --> 00:42:39,259
Epiphany.

607
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:44,097
It's a literary term for
a sudden realization.

608
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:46,401
An "Oh, my God!"

609
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:50,035
revelation where the world
suddenly crystallizes.

610
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:52,608
In our protagonist's case,

611
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:55,944
it's the moment where
she thinks to herself,

612
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:57,947
"Wait a minute."

613
00:42:58,042 --> 00:42:59,385
Nice.

614
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:01,918
"What have I done? And is it worth it?"

615
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,461
In Shakespeare,
some characters are vengeful,

616
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:09,963
sad or suicidal
as a result of their epiphanies.

617
00:43:12,656 --> 00:43:14,135
Excuse me. Where are you going?

618
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:15,930
The girls' room.

619
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:17,729
Shouldn't you ask permission?

620
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:20,505
Can I have permission?

621
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:30,480
Hey, students in my class raise their hand.

622
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:32,115
Am I letting you down?

623
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:34,153
You're letting yourself down.

624
00:43:34,812 --> 00:43:36,723
You're right. Can I go now?

625
00:43:37,214 --> 00:43:39,694
Yeah, don't let me slow you down
on your way to night school.

626
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,658
Answer to number one, Friar Laurence.

627
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:46,095
Two, the Capulets. Three, Mercutio.

628
00:44:11,782 --> 00:44:12,760
Let me hear it.

629
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:14,887
Close the register every night
same as always,

630
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:17,488
but make each day a separate cash pile.

631
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:20,762
Pile each pile in the safe
and then lock the safe.

632
00:44:21,058 --> 00:44:22,036
With...

633
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:27,072
We're winning Crab Fest, do you know why?

634
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:31,203
Because you trust everything back here
is gonna be just great.

635
00:44:31,301 --> 00:44:32,405
Yeah, that, too.

636
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:38,748
- Later. Expect my call.
- Yep.

637
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,991
Did you ever get the tequila?

638
00:44:48,786 --> 00:44:49,856
- Tequila?
- Yeah.

639
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:52,559
God, I hate tequila. It makes me so sick.

640
00:44:52,656 --> 00:44:54,897
Okay, let's get to work.

641
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,502
- Hello?
- Ms. Gutierrez?

642
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:03,272
Gutierrez. Yes?

643
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,643
I'm from accounting at Bronley.

644
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:10,742
Just wanted to make sure you're aware that
your daughter's tuition is showing unpaid?

645
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:14,117
Yes, I'm so sorry.
I actually just gave her that check.

646
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:16,623
Would cash be an inconvenience?

647
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:20,856
I mean, I only ask because
your last two checks gave us some trouble.

648
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:25,196
I'm home, chaparrita.

649
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:49,723
Ansiedad! I'm missing money from my tin.

650
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:50,914
What tin?

651
00:45:51,048 --> 00:45:54,291
My tin, Ansiedad!
Where I keep my bill money!

652
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:57,421
- It's Anne, Mom.
- It's what?

653
00:45:57,621 --> 00:45:58,827
People call me Anne.

654
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:01,900
I don't care what people call you!
I'm missing money!

655
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:03,637
Are you saying I took it?

656
00:46:03,894 --> 00:46:05,567
I'm pretty sure you know better.

657
00:46:05,662 --> 00:46:07,608
Well, I do, so I didn't.

658
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,216
Sol miscounted?

659
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:17,546
- You've done it before.
- I know.

660
00:46:18,175 --> 00:46:20,917
By the way, we are also missing shampoo.

661
00:46:24,982 --> 00:46:26,962
- Don't open the curtain!
- Turn around.

662
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:28,188
- Mom!
- What do you think?

663
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:31,129
I haven't seen this before.
You forget I gave birth to you.

664
00:46:49,706 --> 00:46:51,481
You would have been a good hairdresser.

665
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:54,953
I didn't almost make it
through beauty school for nothing, huh?

666
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:02,964
Hey, how is that little rich friend of yours?
I haven't seen her around.

667
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:07,227
Her name's Tavita.

668
00:47:07,357 --> 00:47:08,995
Yeah, right.

669
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:12,467
Hey.

670
00:47:12,563 --> 00:47:14,770
Hey. Hey. Hey, you okay?

671
00:47:25,642 --> 00:47:28,919
Hey, I didn't expect to
hear from you. Yeah.

672
00:47:29,646 --> 00:47:31,421
When?

673
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:34,189
In the morning? That's refreshing.

674
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:37,993
Let me call you from my "phone" phone,
'cause I have to save my minutes.

675
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:49,843
So I guess I just miscounted, you know.

676
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:54,080
Somewhere along the way, I thought
I had more money than I actually did.

677
00:47:54,605 --> 00:47:57,848
Is there a reason we're meeting here
instead of, you know...

678
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:03,355
Instead of some place
with a bed and free HBO?

679
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,290
Yes, because I need to talk.

680
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:07,862
Yeah, but...

681
00:48:09,152 --> 00:48:10,130
Okay.

682
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:13,667
I'm sorry. Am I wasting
your little window of opportunity

683
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:16,533
by talking about
my daughter's unpaid tuition bills?

684
00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:17,799
All right.

685
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:19,340
Maybe you trust your daughter too much.

686
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:21,204
Maybe she took the missing money.

687
00:48:21,298 --> 00:48:23,278
- No, no.
- Anyway, here.

688
00:48:24,001 --> 00:48:25,412
Take this.

689
00:48:25,502 --> 00:48:27,004
Now can we go?

690
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:36,648
But I was kidding. I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.

691
00:48:36,847 --> 00:48:38,485
- Sit down.
- It's not funny.

692
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:40,854
Sit...

693
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:44,722
I've spoken with a lawyer.

694
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:50,234
And looks like
we're gonna have to leave town.

695
00:48:50,327 --> 00:48:51,465
- You talked to a lawyer?
- Yeah.

696
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:54,901
Being serious right now, right?

697
00:48:55,465 --> 00:48:57,206
Look at this face.

698
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:00,712
- Clean slate.
- Clean slate.

699
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:01,908
Just you and me.

700
00:49:02,172 --> 00:49:03,981
Just the two of us.

701
00:49:04,841 --> 00:49:06,320
Just the two of us?

702
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:08,384
Yeah.

703
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:13,322
The three of us.

704
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:15,921
I meant the three of us.

705
00:49:20,657 --> 00:49:21,829
Where are you going?

706
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:42,690
Hey!

707
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:46,254
What the hell? How'd you get in my car?

708
00:49:46,883 --> 00:49:47,884
Girl secret.

709
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:51,656
I wanted to know
if you're going to that party tonight.

710
00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:53,560
Maybe.

711
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:55,693
I understand.

712
00:49:55,959 --> 00:49:59,270
But if you see me there,
will you take my virginity?

713
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:04,042
What is this? What is this?

714
00:50:04,134 --> 00:50:06,273
Unless that's not something
you'd wanna do.

715
00:50:08,472 --> 00:50:10,008
No, I'll do it.

716
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:12,812
I mean, that's what I do anyway.

717
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:15,356
Great.

718
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:18,485
I have another favour to ask.

719
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:22,524
- Anything-
- Okay.

720
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:27,398
I have this list of things I need to do.

721
00:50:28,091 --> 00:50:29,069
Wanna help?

722
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:30,834
With what?

723
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:34,001
A first kiss.

724
00:50:35,932 --> 00:50:37,707
You haven't even had a first kiss?

725
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:40,314
No.

726
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:45,082
You want me to be your first kiss?

727
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:48,757
But it has to be awkward and clumsy
and I have to hate it.

728
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:51,281
All right.

729
00:51:27,851 --> 00:51:29,455
You know, if you tell anybody
that happened,

730
00:51:29,553 --> 00:51:32,261
I'm gonna call you a liar to your face.

731
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,930
You're going to be perfect.

732
00:51:44,534 --> 00:51:45,569
Stop following me!

733
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:46,943
- Please?
- You're not my girlfriend.

734
00:51:47,037 --> 00:51:48,948
No matter what we do in my basement.

735
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:50,916
So step off, Shrek.

736
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:52,419
Hey.

737
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:54,514
Don't pick on her.

738
00:51:54,711 --> 00:51:56,452
Only you can, right?

739
00:51:58,348 --> 00:52:00,988
I thought so. What do you care anyway?

740
00:52:01,084 --> 00:52:03,963
Shouldn't you be somewhere
getting your hole punched for your story?

741
00:52:04,488 --> 00:52:06,229
- Tavita.
- He's right!

742
00:52:07,824 --> 00:52:08,928
What do you care?

743
00:52:10,093 --> 00:52:12,164
This is your fault, all of it.

744
00:52:14,731 --> 00:52:16,074
I hate you.

745
00:52:41,391 --> 00:52:44,463
I'm just here to say goodbye, Maude.

746
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:45,904
It's time for me to go.

747
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:52,537
I bought this for you
with the money I stole.

748
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,580
The big moment's tonight.

749
00:52:58,775 --> 00:53:00,880
I'll be mature after that,

750
00:53:01,144 --> 00:53:02,646
and then I'm gone.

751
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:05,689
But I wanted to say,

752
00:53:07,317 --> 00:53:12,130
I took death off my list, so you don't
have to die if you don't want to.

753
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:14,463
Because soon,

754
00:53:15,225 --> 00:53:18,502
I'll experience all the
loss I'll need to grow.

755
00:53:18,595 --> 00:53:21,007
It's been really nice to have someone
who cares, Maude.

756
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:23,942
Thank you for being there for me.

757
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:26,878
You've been there for me as well.

758
00:53:27,637 --> 00:53:30,345
- Maude, you spoke.
- Excuse me?

759
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:32,384
I'm sorry, who are you?

760
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:35,747
- Goodbye, Maude!
- My child!

761
00:53:35,845 --> 00:53:39,258
What are you doing here? And why
did you just call my mother Maude?

762
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:41,351
Come on, Mom. I'm taking you home.

763
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:47,065
Lo Mein, crab appetizers, table eight.

764
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,135
Grace, phone.

765
00:53:51,294 --> 00:53:52,295
Crab Shack, Grace.

766
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:55,569
<i>Grace, it's me.
I'm out front. I messed up.</i>

767
00:53:56,266 --> 00:53:59,179
Of course Ansiedad is part of the plan.

768
00:53:59,269 --> 00:54:01,408
It was a slip. Like I miscounted.

769
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:03,245
- Stupid.
- Grace, call.

770
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,717
Are you listening to me?

771
00:54:04,941 --> 00:54:06,045
Crab Shack, Grace.

772
00:54:06,142 --> 00:54:07,280
Grace, it's Emile.

773
00:54:07,444 --> 00:54:08,889
- Busy tonight?
- Are you there?

774
00:54:08,979 --> 00:54:10,856
- Yeah, you have no idea.
- Grace.

775
00:54:11,848 --> 00:54:14,590
Can you call me back
when you actually take me seriously?

776
00:54:14,684 --> 00:54:16,095
I do take you seriously.

777
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:19,599
Oh, no, Emile. I know you do.
I'm so thankful for you taking me seriously...

778
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:22,431
Excuse me. The back toilet is clogged
and that is disgusting.

779
00:54:22,525 --> 00:54:25,369
This a restaurant
and that's not sanitary or hygienic.

780
00:54:25,462 --> 00:54:26,440
Hello.

781
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:27,970
We can work...

782
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:29,577
Grace, listen to me.

783
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:31,345
Who's this?

784
00:54:32,202 --> 00:54:33,374
What do you mean I have no...

785
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:35,216
Mission, why are you answering the phone?

786
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:36,306
Yes.

787
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:37,384
It's Emile.

788
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:40,455
No, we can't deliver a meal right now,
we're busy. Thank you.

789
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:42,383
Oh, for God's sake.

790
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,086
Grace, are you there?

791
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:47,457
Write a sign that says, "Out of service,"
and tape it to the bathroom.

792
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:48,528
Test me.

793
00:54:50,854 --> 00:54:51,832
What?

794
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:53,935
Test me to see if I take you seriously.

795
00:54:57,494 --> 00:54:58,837
College Terrace.

796
00:54:59,262 --> 00:55:00,536
What's that?

797
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:04,140
That's where we can go for my web design.

798
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:07,681
I can go to college there
and that's where I'll get my certificate.

799
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:09,182
Me and you, Ansiedad.

800
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:11,286
A beautiful little house!

801
00:55:11,775 --> 00:55:13,254
Start a new family.

802
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:19,253
And Becky knows somebody at Facebook.
So, it's all set up. You in?

803
00:55:23,253 --> 00:55:24,254
Of course.

804
00:55:25,188 --> 00:55:26,792
Palo Alto. Yes.

805
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:29,933
I could move my practice there.

806
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:31,903
You misspelled "service."

807
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:33,702
Oh, God, do it again with a.

808
00:55:33,797 --> 00:55:35,834
Hey, how about some service, please?

809
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:41,643
Oh, man!

810
00:55:42,972 --> 00:55:45,111
- Grace.
- Yeah, what?

811
00:55:45,742 --> 00:55:47,119
I have to ask you one question.

812
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:53,457
Does Becky know someone
at Facebook or on Facebook?

813
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:56,724
What?

814
00:55:57,454 --> 00:56:01,869
I mean, you don't really think you're gonna
get a job working at Facebook, do you?

815
00:56:02,959 --> 00:56:04,302
Gracey.

816
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:09,642
Go home to Mrs. Harford.

817
00:56:11,801 --> 00:56:13,337
Goodbye.

818
00:56:18,274 --> 00:56:21,517
Wanna go home, buddy?

819
00:56:21,611 --> 00:56:24,524
Yeah? Yeah.

820
00:56:26,249 --> 00:56:27,353
Let's do that.

821
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:39,430
Oh, it's nothing.

822
00:56:39,529 --> 00:56:40,906
This one needs a hospital.

823
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:44,102
It's a little cut.
That's a little nick, just tough it out.

824
00:56:48,338 --> 00:56:50,340
Now baby, you clear it with your mouth.

825
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,351
Come on!

826
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:54,455
I pay the mortgage on this place, lady.

827
00:56:54,778 --> 00:56:56,018
Fire, fire!

828
00:56:56,279 --> 00:56:58,555
Stop. Stop! Please, Lo Mein. Chef, chef!

829
00:56:58,648 --> 00:57:00,184
You're my only chef tonight!

830
00:57:05,622 --> 00:57:06,692
Chef!

831
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:09,066
Chef, get over here! Chef!

832
00:57:10,026 --> 00:57:11,437
Chef!

833
00:57:11,528 --> 00:57:13,269
Everything is under control.

834
00:57:43,226 --> 00:57:44,204
Okay.

835
00:57:49,999 --> 00:57:51,774
Mexican jumping shrimps.

836
00:58:19,896 --> 00:58:21,398
Don't do that.

837
00:58:22,432 --> 00:58:25,106
Excuse me. What are you talking about?

838
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:28,845
And you know, I'm the manager now.

839
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:32,078
You can't just come in here
without knocking.

840
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:36,255
And by the way, thank you.

841
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:38,291
You saved me.

842
00:58:40,617 --> 00:58:41,960
I owe you.

843
00:58:47,457 --> 00:58:48,868
Yes?

844
00:58:51,127 --> 00:58:53,232
I know how you can repay me.

845
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:04,844
Here we are.

846
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:22,694
What?

847
00:59:22,792 --> 00:59:24,362
Nothing.

848
00:59:25,795 --> 00:59:27,775
Do I look hot?

849
00:59:27,864 --> 00:59:29,036
Yeah.

850
00:59:29,365 --> 00:59:33,507
Good. Because I'm doing Trevor tonight.

851
00:59:45,615 --> 00:59:48,323
Let's get this party started!

852
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:13,852
This is my cousin's band.

853
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:15,581
Cool.

854
01:00:15,678 --> 01:00:18,056
- I write many of their songs.
- Yeah?

855
01:00:18,147 --> 01:00:19,854
- Yeah.
- Really?

856
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:28,764
He's kidding.

857
01:00:34,397 --> 01:00:37,276
My aunt, she is not in a costume,
it's just her dress.

858
01:00:52,348 --> 01:00:54,828
I don't know
how to dance to this kind of music.

859
01:00:54,917 --> 01:00:56,396
I'll teach you.

860
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:48,607
Hi.

861
01:01:50,506 --> 01:01:51,576
Hey.

862
01:02:46,963 --> 01:02:50,240
This is nice. This is nice.
Yeah, I like it. It's fun.

863
01:02:50,733 --> 01:02:52,679
- You live here?
- Yeah.

864
01:02:53,069 --> 01:02:55,606
- Yeah?
- In this couch.

865
01:02:56,405 --> 01:02:59,318
- Oh, you live there.
- Yeah.

866
01:02:59,408 --> 01:03:03,185
Well, I have a curtain I can shut. Look.

867
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:09,426
This is my Tia Gloria's house.

868
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:11,931
She lets me stay here for now.

869
01:03:12,155 --> 01:03:15,693
Well, until I open my own restaurant.

870
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:18,102
I'm seeing a whole new side to you.

871
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:24,706
How you doing?

872
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:28,673
Please don't be nice to me. Be mean.

873
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:31,175
Right.

874
01:03:31,274 --> 01:03:32,844
Pressure me.

875
01:03:38,548 --> 01:03:40,425
I'm pressuring you.

876
01:03:52,361 --> 01:03:54,307
You're really pretty.

877
01:03:54,397 --> 01:03:56,206
You're being sweet.

878
01:03:57,366 --> 01:03:59,403
I thought you were a womanizing jerk.

879
01:04:06,609 --> 01:04:08,418
That's just a facade.

880
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:11,915
You know, to piss off my dad.

881
01:04:12,815 --> 01:04:15,955
I really want to get to know you.

882
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:23,164
I don't.

883
01:04:24,227 --> 01:04:25,865
Now let's get to it.

884
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:30,233
Put this on and come right back.

885
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:36,846
Okay.

886
01:04:46,682 --> 01:04:50,289
Mission, you are so determinated.

887
01:04:51,821 --> 01:04:55,826
Yeah. You have plans, man, you have plans.

888
01:04:56,425 --> 01:04:58,962
My plans, always fail.

889
01:05:02,798 --> 01:05:03,833
Like right now,

890
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:09,773
Ansiedad's school is gonna kick her out
because I can't pay for her bills.

891
01:05:10,673 --> 01:05:15,144
They're gonna kick her out
because I cannot afford to pay.

892
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:20,484
And then our "job" job sucks.

893
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:24,087
You know, our job at the Shack.

894
01:05:24,186 --> 01:05:26,462
Emile's so mean,
he makes us split all our tips.

895
01:05:26,555 --> 01:05:29,627
He makes you split tips, too, right?

896
01:05:49,111 --> 01:05:50,089
Okay.

897
01:05:51,213 --> 01:05:52,191
Come on.

898
01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:06,239
Oh, no.

899
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,275
No, no, no.

900
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:10,603
No, no, no.

901
01:06:11,767 --> 01:06:12,745
Shoot.

902
01:06:37,293 --> 01:06:39,273
This is for my story.

903
01:07:11,427 --> 01:07:12,531
What are you doing?

904
01:07:15,965 --> 01:07:16,943
Wait.

905
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:22,105
Forgot these.

906
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:25,318
Slut!

907
01:07:25,741 --> 01:07:27,243
- Nothing happened.
- Oh, yeah.

908
01:07:27,543 --> 01:07:28,578
You forgot these.

909
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:31,816
- Look at that.
- Hey, Trevor.

910
01:07:33,849 --> 01:07:34,884
Yeah, I hit that.

911
01:07:34,984 --> 01:07:36,224
- Yeah!
- Oh, my.

912
01:07:40,189 --> 01:07:42,191
You stole my panties.

913
01:07:42,324 --> 01:07:44,201
You sicko.

914
01:07:45,661 --> 01:07:46,731
Get out of here!

915
01:08:02,211 --> 01:08:05,681
Mommy? Mommy, I'm so stupid.

916
01:08:06,482 --> 01:08:07,688
Mommy.

917
01:08:29,338 --> 01:08:31,409
Why aren't you ever here?

918
01:09:12,414 --> 01:09:13,392
My ticket.

919
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:20,634
- It's Saturday.
- Please.

920
01:09:20,756 --> 01:09:24,260
- I need to get into my locker.
- Buzz off before I call the cops.

921
01:09:48,117 --> 01:09:49,596
The Shack.

922
01:10:19,648 --> 01:10:20,956
What happened?

923
01:10:21,517 --> 01:10:23,394
Somebody crowbarred the register.

924
01:10:24,253 --> 01:10:27,200
- What?
- And the safe. They don't know who.

925
01:10:33,862 --> 01:10:35,842
All right. We're done with this guy.

926
01:10:36,632 --> 01:10:38,305
Got anybody else?

927
01:10:41,303 --> 01:10:42,281
You can go.

928
01:10:43,973 --> 01:10:44,951
G race?

929
01:10:45,474 --> 01:10:46,475
Come here.

930
01:10:50,446 --> 01:10:52,016
Come here.

931
01:10:52,514 --> 01:10:53,754
Sit down.

932
01:10:54,016 --> 01:10:57,259
- All right. All right. What about the...
- Put him on copy...

933
01:11:00,522 --> 01:11:02,331
How does this happen on your watch?

934
01:11:05,628 --> 01:11:07,198
This is all I have.

935
01:11:11,367 --> 01:11:13,005
- Have nothing to say?
- No.

936
01:11:16,739 --> 01:11:19,481
Guess you figured out that the
second location's not going to happen.

937
01:11:29,685 --> 01:11:31,596
In case anybody cares,

938
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:33,194
came in third.

939
01:11:35,591 --> 01:11:36,763
Lock up, Olga.

940
01:11:39,328 --> 01:11:41,308
Ma'am. Here's my card.

941
01:11:41,597 --> 01:11:44,771
Think of anything, or if you have any
questions, you can call me at the station.

942
01:11:44,867 --> 01:11:46,938
- Let's go, partner.
- All right.

943
01:11:52,508 --> 01:11:54,215
Hey! Hey!

944
01:11:55,577 --> 01:11:57,113
Did you do this?

945
01:11:57,379 --> 01:11:59,655
Did you break in? Did you get me drunk

946
01:11:59,748 --> 01:12:01,887
and take advantage
and help yourself to this?

947
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:03,725
No. I'm helping you.

948
01:12:04,553 --> 01:12:06,931
You said you needed help
with your daughter's school.

949
01:12:08,223 --> 01:12:09,702
I did it for you.

950
01:12:10,626 --> 01:12:11,900
I'm crazy about you.

951
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:15,601
- Oh, my God.
- Hey, calm down.

952
01:12:15,764 --> 01:12:16,970
- No!
- Calm down!

953
01:12:17,066 --> 01:12:19,273
No calm down. You're an idiot!

954
01:12:19,435 --> 01:12:23,042
What is wrong with you,
what makes you think you can just take...

955
01:12:23,272 --> 01:12:24,410
Okay, okay, okay.

956
01:12:24,506 --> 01:12:25,814
- What are you thinking?
- No one's going to know.

957
01:12:25,908 --> 01:12:28,752
- No one's going to know, okay?
- Grace.

958
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:30,118
I'll give the money back.

959
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:37,021
Some blonde lady wants to talk to you.

960
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:38,930
You lock up, I'm leaving.

961
01:12:49,698 --> 01:12:51,268
If this is about tuition payment, I...

962
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:54,405
No, no. I'm Jill Armstrong,
I'm your daughter's English teacher.

963
01:12:54,503 --> 01:12:55,777
She's been skipping class.

964
01:12:56,605 --> 01:12:58,346
Why hasn't the school called me?

965
01:12:58,440 --> 01:12:59,976
Well, they probably have.

966
01:13:00,075 --> 01:13:02,385
I left you a message
that your daughter erased.

967
01:13:03,245 --> 01:13:06,021
She told me so in a letter
that outlines behaviour that

968
01:13:06,682 --> 01:13:08,218
you know, frankly,

969
01:13:09,118 --> 01:13:11,257
the State would consider parental neglect.

970
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:23,070
But I am not going to call the State.

971
01:13:26,535 --> 01:13:30,108
Your daughter,
she thinks she's in a coming of age story.

972
01:13:30,606 --> 01:13:32,176
She's trying to grow up.

973
01:13:32,674 --> 01:13:35,655
I think she believes
experiencing certain things

974
01:13:35,844 --> 01:13:38,017
will speed that process along. It's like...

975
01:13:38,213 --> 01:13:41,251
It's like she's name checking
these hardships

976
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:45,393
that she can skip to the point where
she's matured from experiencing them.

977
01:13:45,521 --> 01:13:48,400
Oh, God. Look, I didn't
go to Harvard, okay?

978
01:13:49,191 --> 01:13:51,137
I don't have an education.

979
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:53,139
But this stuff you're telling me,

980
01:13:53,228 --> 01:13:55,174
this is something that my mother
would call tarado.

981
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:56,766
Do you know what that means?

982
01:13:57,900 --> 01:13:59,174
Well, it means stupid.

983
01:13:59,668 --> 01:14:04,083
You don't have to go to Harvard
to see a little girl crying out for help.

984
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:07,944
- She's trying to outgrow you, Ms. Gutierrez.
- Have a nice day.

985
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:10,850
She's trying to leave home,
like you left home.

986
01:14:17,486 --> 01:14:18,624
How dare you.

987
01:14:19,655 --> 01:14:23,467
I was 17,
and I had a horror show for a mother.

988
01:14:23,659 --> 01:14:25,229
So how dare you judge me?

989
01:14:25,694 --> 01:14:27,571
I was a little kid.

990
01:14:28,063 --> 01:14:29,838
My mother was never there for me.

991
01:14:39,608 --> 01:14:42,179
You know what,
Ansiedad left this letter for me.

992
01:14:43,412 --> 01:14:45,653
But I'm sorry, I think it's for you.

993
01:14:55,424 --> 01:14:57,131
Dear Jill.

994
01:14:57,726 --> 01:14:59,467
I deleted your message to my mom,

995
01:15:00,062 --> 01:15:02,008
so you'll have to try her again.

996
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:05,172
Maybe this time

997
01:15:05,367 --> 01:15:07,745
mention I've stopped
going to class altogether.

998
01:15:08,971 --> 01:15:10,541
You might also tell her
that I'm drinking now

999
01:15:10,639 --> 01:15:13,085
and doing gateway drugs
as part of my growth.

1000
01:15:16,311 --> 01:15:18,655
Please tell her that I
intend to have sex soon

1001
01:15:18,747 --> 01:15:20,090
and become a woman.

1002
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:23,958
Because that's what she did
to get away from her mother.

1003
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:26,624
She never talks about it,

1004
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:28,900
but I know.

1005
01:15:30,559 --> 01:15:32,300
Thank you for showing me the way.

1006
01:15:33,161 --> 01:15:34,367
Anne.

1007
01:15:37,165 --> 01:15:39,577
I'm gonna need you to be
as specific as possible.

1008
01:15:39,668 --> 01:15:42,239
Don't say "long hair" when
you can say "shoulder length,"

1009
01:15:42,337 --> 01:15:45,284
or "medium height" when
you can say "4'3," understand?

1010
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:46,409
Yes.

1011
01:15:46,508 --> 01:15:48,010
- Hair?
- Long.

1012
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:54,285
- Eyes?
- Brown.

1013
01:16:05,027 --> 01:16:06,472
Hi, is my daughter here?

1014
01:16:07,930 --> 01:16:09,102
Neither is mine.

1015
01:16:10,999 --> 01:16:12,774
Mine left last night.

1016
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:16,545
When did yours leave?

1017
01:16:18,307 --> 01:16:20,719
They each got boyfriends now.

1018
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:24,019
Did you know that?

1019
01:16:24,212 --> 01:16:25,452
And they're smoking, too.

1020
01:16:27,115 --> 01:16:29,391
- You smell your little girl's clothes?
- No.

1021
01:16:29,484 --> 01:16:31,395
No, I don't smell her clothes.

1022
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:33,931
The police ask you
where you think she might be?

1023
01:16:34,890 --> 01:16:36,494
- Yes. And...
- And?

1024
01:16:37,859 --> 01:16:40,567
What time she left this morning,
and what clothes she was wearing,

1025
01:16:40,662 --> 01:16:43,973
and where she goes and who she goes with.

1026
01:16:44,533 --> 01:16:46,103
And I didn't know.

1027
01:16:50,005 --> 01:16:51,985
Excuse me.

1028
01:16:53,742 --> 01:16:56,416
Hello? This is she.

1029
01:16:57,379 --> 01:16:59,825
Where? Is she okay?

1030
01:17:23,205 --> 01:17:24,479
What are you doing here?

1031
01:17:24,706 --> 01:17:26,151
I need bus money.

1032
01:17:26,742 --> 01:17:28,016
I'm leaving Grace.

1033
01:17:29,011 --> 01:17:30,115
You can either reach for your wallet

1034
01:17:30,212 --> 01:17:33,455
or we're 30 seconds away from the wife
wondering what's going on out here.

1035
01:17:34,516 --> 01:17:36,587
So, in other words, you're extorting me?

1036
01:17:37,853 --> 01:17:38,888
Is that okay?

1037
01:17:41,556 --> 01:17:45,265
Listen. When you're older,
and you think about this, and you will,

1038
01:17:46,128 --> 01:17:47,630
I want you to remember this.

1039
01:17:49,464 --> 01:17:52,104
Nothing is as black and white as it seems,
and love

1040
01:17:53,368 --> 01:17:56,747
is a lot more complicated and beautiful
than you'll ever imagine.

1041
01:18:01,143 --> 01:18:02,588
Where's your mother, dear?

1042
01:18:03,845 --> 01:18:05,119
I don't know, ma'am.

1043
01:18:07,883 --> 01:18:09,328
- Dr. Harford.
- Yeah?

1044
01:18:10,218 --> 01:18:11,424
It's raining.

1045
01:18:12,154 --> 01:18:13,292
Your jacket.

1046
01:18:27,469 --> 01:18:29,244
Your son needs glasses.

1047
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:11,755
There you go.

1048
01:19:34,736 --> 01:19:36,215
Why are we stopping?

1049
01:19:43,211 --> 01:19:45,384
- Get off me.
- I am not letting you go.

1050
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:47,721
- Get away.
- I am not letting you go.

1051
01:19:47,816 --> 01:19:50,820
Leave me alone.
That's what you're good at, right?

1052
01:19:53,955 --> 01:19:56,526
Ansiedad, please, please.

1053
01:19:57,592 --> 01:19:59,196
Please, please.

1054
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:01,668
Thank you. Baby, I'm sorry.

1055
01:20:02,864 --> 01:20:06,277
- Where were you last night?
- Oh, God. I'm sorry.

1056
01:20:07,235 --> 01:20:08,839
Why aren't you ever there?

1057
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:11,209
- I don't need this, I'm going back.
- Baby.

1058
01:20:11,306 --> 01:20:13,912
No, Ansiedad. Please, please.

1059
01:20:14,176 --> 01:20:15,416
Baby, please.

1060
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:17,717
How did you even find me?

1061
01:20:18,013 --> 01:20:19,822
Your doctor boyfriend call you?

1062
01:20:20,015 --> 01:20:21,358
His wife.

1063
01:20:21,449 --> 01:20:23,929
- That's all over now.
- Until the next guy.

1064
01:20:24,653 --> 01:20:26,223
And then I don't exist again.

1065
01:20:27,022 --> 01:20:28,626
Baby, you do exist.

1066
01:20:28,723 --> 01:20:32,466
- I'm not your baby.
- Yes, you are, and I know that now.

1067
01:20:34,029 --> 01:20:35,303
Too late.

1068
01:20:37,732 --> 01:20:39,143
Ansiedad.

1069
01:20:39,968 --> 01:20:42,539
Ansiedad. Stop.

1070
01:20:43,872 --> 01:20:45,749
I don't want you out there alone.

1071
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:48,788
I don't want what happened
to your friend to happen to you.

1072
01:20:51,646 --> 01:20:52,954
What friend?

1073
01:20:53,882 --> 01:20:55,054
Come here, baby.

1074
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:57,791
What friend, Mom?
What are you talking about?

1075
01:20:57,886 --> 01:20:59,331
Tavita.

1076
01:20:59,554 --> 01:21:01,056
She took some pills.

1077
01:21:03,959 --> 01:21:07,304
- You're lying. No.
- No, she's in bad shape.

1078
01:21:08,396 --> 01:21:11,309
- I didn't do that. I didn't do that.
- No, of course you didn't do it.

1079
01:21:11,399 --> 01:21:12,935
- I didn't wink.
- Of course you didn't do it.

1080
01:21:13,034 --> 01:21:14,672
Oh, you don't know.

1081
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:19,853
- You don't know what I did. You don't know.
- Tell me.

1082
01:21:26,214 --> 01:21:27,215
Ansiedad.

1083
01:21:27,749 --> 01:21:28,750
Go away.

1084
01:21:30,018 --> 01:21:31,622
Ansiedad, stop.

1085
01:21:35,023 --> 01:21:36,263
I'm sorry, baby.

1086
01:21:36,992 --> 01:21:38,266
Leave me alone.

1087
01:21:50,071 --> 01:21:51,516
Ansiedad, please.

1088
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:54,247
You never cared about me.

1089
01:21:54,709 --> 01:21:56,382
Baby, I'm sorry.

1090
01:22:01,149 --> 01:22:02,127
Baby.

1091
01:23:57,532 --> 01:24:00,672
She's going to be okay,
but make sure she's not left alone.

1092
01:24:02,270 --> 01:24:06,218
She needs a lot of care.
I'll be back tomorrow. Bye.

1093
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:40,977
Last assignment of the year.

1094
01:24:41,443 --> 01:24:45,755
Two hundred words
on the nature of child versus adult

1095
01:24:45,847 --> 01:24:48,293
as pertaining to the stories
that we've discussed.

1096
01:24:52,921 --> 01:24:54,525
And are those

1097
01:24:54,789 --> 01:24:57,531
as separate as we've been led to believe?

1098
01:24:59,194 --> 01:25:02,664
Now, please avoid making
overblown closing statements

1099
01:25:06,367 --> 01:25:09,746
or sweeping proclamations about life.

1100
01:25:11,473 --> 01:25:14,647
Keep things like unselfishness,

1101
01:25:17,412 --> 01:25:18,891
inevitability...

1102
01:25:20,315 --> 01:25:23,262
Glasses don't work
if you don't wear them. There.

1103
01:25:23,351 --> 01:25:26,662
- ...Responsibility...
- How's that? Lean back a little bit.

1104
01:25:28,323 --> 01:25:29,529
Forgiveness...

1105
01:25:30,425 --> 01:25:32,837
Hey, hey, dirty dishes in the sink, Mister.

1106
01:25:34,229 --> 01:25:35,572
Not on the counter.

1107
01:25:36,264 --> 01:25:39,108
Limited to your own personal experience.

1108
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:51,685
Please include a section discussing growth,

1109
01:25:52,747 --> 01:25:54,522
and is it limited to youth?

1110
01:26:01,856 --> 01:26:03,802
Or are we constantly evolving?

1111
01:26:07,762 --> 01:26:09,605
- I know that's good!
- Mom!

1112
01:26:15,737 --> 01:26:19,913
Can someone argue that life
is a succession of rites of passage,

1113
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:26,785
a <i>long string of big
and small moments,</i>

1114
01:26:27,882 --> 01:26:30,021
<i>where we essentially come of age?</i>

1115
01:26:49,037 --> 01:26:51,176
Aren't we constantly changing
throughout our lives?

1116
01:26:57,512 --> 01:26:59,617
And isn't that a good thing after all?

1117
01:27:14,729 --> 01:27:15,707
Thanks.

1118
01:27:17,465 --> 01:27:20,537
Well, if I'm right, this is the part
where you apologize to me.

1119
01:27:21,202 --> 01:27:22,180
You're right.

1120
01:27:22,804 --> 01:27:24,613
And I'm sorry on my mom's behalf, too.

1121
01:27:25,273 --> 01:27:28,618
- She's too proud to thank you.
- You know, you give her no credit.

1122
01:27:29,210 --> 01:27:31,349
Maybe she called me yesterday
to do just that.

1123
01:27:33,514 --> 01:27:34,492
Really?

1124
01:27:35,216 --> 01:27:36,524
Maybe.

1125
01:27:36,784 --> 01:27:38,991
Or maybe that's my addition to your story.

1126
01:27:40,221 --> 01:27:41,996
We never talked about the lesson.

1127
01:27:43,391 --> 01:27:44,461
I'm sorry?

1128
01:27:45,793 --> 01:27:48,296
In coming of age stories,
there's always a lesson.

1129
01:27:49,063 --> 01:27:51,441
The thing you learn
so mistakes stop repeating.

1130
01:27:52,166 --> 01:27:53,406
And did you learn it?

1131
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:56,376
I think so.

1132
01:28:14,922 --> 01:28:15,900
I'm sorry.

1133
01:28:23,531 --> 01:28:24,976
Do you want to come inside?

1134
01:28:25,333 --> 01:28:26,311
I got to go...

1135
01:28:26,601 --> 01:28:28,012
My mom's waiting for me.

1136
01:28:29,337 --> 01:28:31,146
Okay. Call me.

1137
01:28:31,706 --> 01:28:32,912
I will.

1138
01:28:42,350 --> 01:28:44,193
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1139
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:49,700
We haven't been to Connecticut yet.
Or parts of Canada.

1140
01:28:49,791 --> 01:28:51,031
We could move there.

1141
01:28:51,125 --> 01:28:52,468
We're not moving.

1142
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:54,039
We always move.

1143
01:28:54,295 --> 01:28:55,865
How about Lancaster, New York?

1144
01:28:55,963 --> 01:28:56,941
Baby.

1145
01:28:58,266 --> 01:28:59,540
We're not moving.

1146
01:29:05,973 --> 01:29:07,281
So can we talk about my name change now?

1147
01:29:07,375 --> 01:29:08,854
Oh, brother.

1148
01:29:08,943 --> 01:29:10,081
I spoke to the county clerk

1149
01:29:10,178 --> 01:29:12,351
and he'll need your signature
on a petition I've already filled.

1150
01:29:12,447 --> 01:29:15,121
- You have a beautiful name.
- And you changed yours.

1151
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:16,886
Okay, I'll make you a deal.

1152
01:29:17,085 --> 01:29:18,996
For now you keep it, and when you turn 18,

1153
01:29:19,153 --> 01:29:20,996
- you can change it.
- I can't wait.

1154
01:29:21,689 --> 01:29:22,759
I know.

1155
01:29:23,524 --> 01:29:24,730
Let's get home.
