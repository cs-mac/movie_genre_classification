1
00:00:11,601 --> 00:00:13,035
. Vamos.
Let's go now.

2
00:00:13,103 --> 00:00:15,004
You have
full hospital privileges.

3
00:00:15,071 --> 00:00:16,539
Transplant team's
standing by.

4
00:00:16,606 --> 00:00:19,008
Sarah's sister's inside.
How much time do we have?

5
00:00:19,075 --> 00:00:21,477
She'll go into full
renal failure within 72 hours

6
00:00:21,545 --> 00:00:23,045
Without the sister's kidney.

7
00:00:23,113 --> 00:00:25,948
It's not a perfect match,
but the next best thing.

8
00:00:26,016 --> 00:00:27,950
D--oh, hi.
Hi. Come on.

9
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:30,419
Oh, I don't get my kidney
until I dish?

10
00:00:30,487 --> 00:00:31,921
That's right.

11
00:00:31,988 --> 00:00:33,923
Uh, seattle grace
is merging with mercy west,

12
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,926
Which means half the doctors
in the city are out of a job.

13
00:00:36,993 --> 00:00:39,862
I'm getting a divorce,
which means I'm a single mom.

14
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,363
Stevens has cancer.

15
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:43,866
Meredith and derek got married
on a post-it note.

16
00:00:43,934 --> 00:00:46,836
And george o'malley is dead,
but you knew that already.
(sighs)

17
00:00:46,903 --> 00:00:49,839
Um, I don't sleep much anymore
because I lay awake at night

18
00:00:49,906 --> 00:00:51,841
And wonder
where all the joy is.

19
00:00:51,908 --> 00:00:53,342
During the day,

20
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:56,278
I realize that the joy
packed its bags and left.

21
00:00:56,346 --> 00:00:59,315
The glasses of t world
are half-empty.
But... You're an attending.

22
00:00:59,382 --> 00:01:01,383
I am an attending.
How are you?

23
00:01:01,451 --> 00:01:02,985
I--
dr. Bailey.

24
00:01:03,053 --> 00:01:05,654
Ah, this is our chief
of staff, dr. Charlotte king.

25
00:01:05,722 --> 00:01:07,623
Oh, I appreciate
the professional courtesy.

26
00:01:07,691 --> 00:01:10,125
I hear you have a nice
little hospital here.
We're small but efficient.

27
00:01:10,193 --> 00:01:12,528
You came to the best place
to get the job done...
Mm.

28
00:01:12,596 --> 00:01:15,164
Right this time.

29
00:01:15,232 --> 00:01:17,833
The donor's a single mom
with three small children

30
00:01:17,901 --> 00:01:20,269
And an ex-husband
who likes to hit things.

31
00:01:20,337 --> 00:01:23,305
Jumping on a plane
out of state's not an option.

32
00:01:23,373 --> 00:01:26,442
Otherwise, seattle grace would
have been the obvious choice,

33
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,577
Cutting-edge teaching hospital
and all.

34
00:01:28,645 --> 00:01:31,080
Here at st. Ambrose, you'll find
the doctors don't need teaching.

35
00:01:31,147 --> 00:01:33,015
They already know
what they're doing.

36
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:34,984
Excuse me.

37
00:01:35,051 --> 00:01:37,453
Sorry about that.
She's a little, uh...

38
00:01:37,521 --> 00:01:40,623
I don't have to like her.
I just need her o.R.

39
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:43,626
Dr. Bailey. Well, well, well.
Look at you.

40
00:01:43,693 --> 00:01:45,594
Why are we looking at me?

41
00:01:45,662 --> 00:01:49,031
No, I just meant that...
I didn't mean...

42
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:50,566
Hello.

43
00:01:50,634 --> 00:01:53,302
What are we waiting for?
Where's my kidney?

44
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,271
(clears throat)

45
00:01:55,338 --> 00:01:57,740
Bailey's here.

46
00:01:57,807 --> 00:02:01,776
Sync by honeybunny
www.addic7ed.com

47
00:02:02,646 --> 00:02:05,481
(addison) sam's agreed to be
internist to both sisters.

48
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:08,017
Emily, this is dr. Bailey.
She'll be performing

49
00:02:08,084 --> 00:02:10,085
The transplant.
I'm ready.

50
00:02:10,153 --> 00:02:11,987
Okay, well, first
we'll take you through

51
00:02:12,055 --> 00:02:13,956
The pre-surgery protocol.
You already have my file.

52
00:02:14,024 --> 00:02:17,092
I was tested as a partial match
three years ago.

53
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,428
Sarah needs my kidney now.
Your sister's stabilized.

54
00:02:19,496 --> 00:02:22,498
If we do this tomorrow,
we should be fine.
Sarah fought to stay alive
for three excruciating years

55
00:02:22,566 --> 00:02:24,833
While you waited
to find a match.

56
00:02:24,901 --> 00:02:27,503
Now somebody screwed up,
and she's dying.

57
00:02:27,571 --> 00:02:30,039
She's done waiting.
I'm done waiting.
Sarah's gone through
a tremendous amount

58
00:02:30,106 --> 00:02:32,041
Of physical trauma
in the last 24 hours.

59
00:02:32,108 --> 00:02:33,842
She just got off
an air ambulance.

60
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,811
Her system was fragile
even before she had

61
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,546
The failed organ transplant.

62
00:02:37,614 --> 00:02:40,215
Now, hey, I'm the first
to admit, we made mistakes.

63
00:02:40,283 --> 00:02:42,651
But we will not rush her
into another surgery

64
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:45,321
Before we've got a whole slew
of tests telling us

65
00:02:45,388 --> 00:02:47,323
That she's strong enough
to handle it.

66
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,659
We do this right,
or we don't do it at all.

67
00:02:50,727 --> 00:02:52,628
Yes, I'm... I'm sorry.

68
00:02:52,696 --> 00:02:55,598
It's just...
It's my sister.

69
00:02:57,434 --> 00:03:01,070
Well, I'm going to fix this.

70
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,041
(footsteps approach)

71
00:03:06,109 --> 00:03:07,776
Welcome back.

72
00:03:07,844 --> 00:03:10,879
Oh, thank you, sheldon.
(chuckles)

73
00:03:10,947 --> 00:03:12,414
(laughs)

74
00:03:12,482 --> 00:03:15,217
How are ya?
No, no, not therapeutically.

75
00:03:15,285 --> 00:03:16,685
I mean just as friends.

76
00:03:16,753 --> 00:03:18,687
You know, when someone
mes back to work,

77
00:03:18,755 --> 00:03:21,156
It's a friendly question,
you know, so...

78
00:03:21,224 --> 00:03:23,325
Well, letting that go.
(chuckles)
(chuckles)

79
00:03:23,393 --> 00:03:25,594
How's the baby?
You found a good nanny?

80
00:03:27,097 --> 00:03:29,665
I gave him to pete.
What?

81
00:03:29,733 --> 00:03:32,768
I gave the baby to pete.
To babysit? To--to visit?
To--to what?

82
00:03:32,836 --> 00:03:34,837
To live. To be.

83
00:03:34,904 --> 00:03:36,839
To... I...

84
00:03:36,906 --> 00:03:39,608
Gave him to pete.
Lucas could be my son.

85
00:03:39,676 --> 00:03:42,611
I know.
He is your son,
and you gave him to pete?

86
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:45,514
You gave him to pete?
It was... (sighs)
for the best.

87
00:03:45,582 --> 00:03:47,282
It's for the best?
I-I have no words.

88
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,351
There are no words.
Words are not enough!

89
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:52,287
Sheldon, sheldon,
this is my first day back.

90
00:03:52,355 --> 00:03:54,623
I am...
Doing the best I can.

91
00:03:54,691 --> 00:03:57,793
Could you just go?

92
00:03:57,861 --> 00:03:59,628
Can you go?

93
00:03:59,696 --> 00:04:01,664
Well, I--
can you just--

94
00:04:01,731 --> 00:04:05,401
<i>'cause it would really help
if you would just...</i>

95
00:04:11,241 --> 00:04:13,175
Luke is living with you?

96
00:04:13,243 --> 00:04:15,277
Shh.
Lucas is trying to sleep.

97
00:04:15,345 --> 00:04:16,845
So...

98
00:04:16,913 --> 00:04:19,348
So violet just
gave him to you?

99
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:21,417
What's going on, pete,
with violet?

100
00:04:21,484 --> 00:04:23,585
She's working on things.

101
00:04:23,653 --> 00:04:28,023
Don't worry, sheldon.
Lucas is fine.

102
00:04:32,796 --> 00:04:34,863
Okay. Everything looks good.

103
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:37,833
Now we're gonna let teresa
take a blood sample from you.

104
00:04:37,901 --> 00:04:41,070
Uh, my blood type is a-b,
I'm r-h positive,

105
00:04:41,137 --> 00:04:42,571
And I'm a scorpio.

106
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,207
What more do you need
to know?
Probably nothing.

107
00:04:45,275 --> 00:04:48,010
But why don't you let us
do our job

108
00:04:48,078 --> 00:04:51,080
So dr. Bailey can do hers?
Is she good--dr. Bailey?

109
00:04:51,147 --> 00:04:53,982
Because after what happened
in seattle--
dr. Bailey
is one of the best.

110
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,719
She seems
a little, um... Cold.

111
00:04:56,786 --> 00:04:58,987
(laughs)
she's a surgeon.

112
00:04:59,055 --> 00:05:02,591
Uh, you want her to be quick,
decisive, and she's both.

113
00:05:02,659 --> 00:05:05,027
She's good. You have
nothing to worry about.

114
00:05:05,095 --> 00:05:07,262
I have three kids
to worry about.

115
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:11,300
Uh, sarah saved us...
All of us.

116
00:05:11,367 --> 00:05:14,203
I married a bad guy,
and I couldn't get out.

117
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,739
I just... Watched my life

118
00:05:16,806 --> 00:05:19,041
Turn into
this terrible place.

119
00:05:19,109 --> 00:05:21,343
Then sarah flew in.

120
00:05:21,411 --> 00:05:24,680
She took care of the kids,
stayed with us for six months

121
00:05:24,748 --> 00:05:26,682
And made sure
we were all safe.

122
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,585
My babies don't have a dad.
They don't have grandparents.

123
00:05:29,652 --> 00:05:32,488
They have me
and they have sarah.

124
00:05:32,555 --> 00:05:34,623
(voice breaks) we need her.

125
00:05:34,691 --> 00:05:38,560
You're giving up an organ.
We don't take that lightly.

126
00:05:38,628 --> 00:05:40,129
Okay.

127
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,800
Oh, hey.

128
00:05:44,868 --> 00:05:47,035
You're good with her.

129
00:05:47,103 --> 00:05:49,004
Thanks.
How's the sister?

130
00:05:49,072 --> 00:05:51,306
Oh, she's stable for now.

131
00:05:51,374 --> 00:05:53,242
And you're comfortable
with this match?

132
00:05:53,309 --> 00:05:55,344
It wasn't a good match
three years ago,

133
00:05:55,411 --> 00:05:57,780
But with all the progress
in anti-rejection drugs,

134
00:05:57,847 --> 00:05:59,414
We'll make it work.

135
00:05:59,482 --> 00:06:01,350
Hey, it's all we got.

136
00:06:01,417 --> 00:06:02,618
Okay.

137
00:06:02,685 --> 00:06:04,753
How are those
anxiety attacks?

138
00:06:04,821 --> 00:06:06,889
Asthma.
Right.

139
00:06:10,393 --> 00:06:12,561
It was asthma.

140
00:06:14,464 --> 00:06:16,799
Ryan's driving me crazy.

141
00:06:16,866 --> 00:06:18,834
I keep telling him
at it takes time

142
00:06:18,902 --> 00:06:21,336
To build a new immune system
from scratch, but--

143
00:06:21,404 --> 00:06:24,306
But he's 16, and he's living
in suburban jail.

144
00:06:24,374 --> 00:06:26,875
Not that
it's not beautiful.

145
00:06:26,943 --> 00:06:29,578
(air hisses)

146
00:06:29,646 --> 00:06:31,513
(hiss)

147
00:06:31,581 --> 00:06:33,782
My man.

148
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:36,051
Do you know how many things
you can't do

149
00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:38,020
While your mother
is watching every second?

150
00:06:38,087 --> 00:06:39,788
(cooper) yeah, 2,563.

151
00:06:39,856 --> 00:06:42,724
Two years, coop.
Almost two years in a bubble.

152
00:06:42,792 --> 00:06:44,827
Yeah, with digital cable

153
00:06:44,894 --> 00:06:47,629
And wi-fi, dvr, dvd.

154
00:06:47,697 --> 00:06:50,833
There are a lot of people
that would call that heaven.

155
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,802
You want me to grow up
to be a eunuch?

156
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,805
Spill it. (clears throat)
homecoming, tomorrow.

157
00:06:56,873 --> 00:07:00,976
Kelli's going, I'm n,
and francis stokes is.
She'd kiss a guy
named francis?

158
00:07:01,044 --> 00:07:03,345
Okay, look, you're gonna
get outta here.

159
00:07:03,413 --> 00:07:05,280
It's not like the old days,
when being born

160
00:07:05,348 --> 00:07:07,316
Without an immune system
meant you have to stay

161
00:07:07,383 --> 00:07:09,151
In a place like this forever.

162
00:07:09,219 --> 00:07:10,719
You are getting better,

163
00:07:10,787 --> 00:07:13,021
<i>But we gotta be
really careful with scids.</i>

164
00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:16,191
And, you know, I know that this
kissing stuff feels important--
coop, I know 16
was a long time ago,

165
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:18,493
But you have a girlfriend.
You have sex.

166
00:07:18,561 --> 00:07:21,230
I have talk and talk.

167
00:07:21,297 --> 00:07:24,633
And talk is starting to get
really... Old,

168
00:07:24,701 --> 00:07:26,301
Like you.

169
00:07:26,369 --> 00:07:29,338
That's funny. You know, talk can
actually be hard to come by.

170
00:07:29,405 --> 00:07:31,840
I think my girlfriend could
take some lessons from yours.

171
00:07:31,908 --> 00:07:34,409
<i>(computer chirps)
ry.</i>

172
00:07:34,477 --> 00:07:36,979
<i>Hey, ry.
How's the bubble boy?</i>

173
00:07:37,046 --> 00:07:39,314
She won't be
my girlfriend for long.

174
00:07:39,382 --> 00:07:42,551
Isn't there something more
you can do to get me outta here?

175
00:07:42,619 --> 00:07:45,220
(miranda)
I feel like I'm in a spa.

176
00:07:45,288 --> 00:07:48,190
When will the waiter come by
with champagne?
(laughs)

177
00:07:48,258 --> 00:07:51,159
Addison... Uh, dr. Bailey.
How are you?
Naomi. Right.

178
00:07:51,227 --> 00:07:54,596
Uh, I thought
you left the practice.
Uh, I did.

179
00:07:54,664 --> 00:07:58,200
Naomi went downstairs
to run a different practice.

180
00:07:58,268 --> 00:08:00,669
I, uh, I tried
to call you, twice.

181
00:08:00,737 --> 00:08:04,306
I know. I'm sorry.
I've just been crazy busy.

182
00:08:04,374 --> 00:08:07,976
I just came up to,
you know, welcome violet back.

183
00:08:08,044 --> 00:08:09,444
(elevator bell dings)

184
00:08:09,512 --> 00:08:11,413
Thought the two of you
were best friends.

185
00:08:11,481 --> 00:08:13,415
We were. We are.
Uh, I just...

186
00:08:13,483 --> 00:08:16,852
Oh, cooper, cooper, uh,
this is, uh, dr. Bailey,

187
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,854
My friend from seattle.
Oh, hey, wow. Wow.

188
00:08:18,922 --> 00:08:20,822
You're shorter than--
than I thought.

189
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:23,258
I mean, given what sam says,
and addison, about...

190
00:08:23,326 --> 00:08:25,861
That's--it's a compliment.
Um...

191
00:08:25,929 --> 00:08:27,896
I have twins waiting.

192
00:08:27,964 --> 00:08:29,865
Hope he's better with kids
than adults.

193
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:31,400
Mm.
(chuckles)

194
00:08:31,467 --> 00:08:33,435
Oh, violet.

195
00:08:33,503 --> 00:08:35,170
Our therapist. Dr. Bailey.

196
00:08:35,238 --> 00:08:37,439
Oh, hi.

197
00:08:37,507 --> 00:08:39,341
Well, I...

198
00:08:40,877 --> 00:08:43,745
Wait. So is she the one
you said had the baby

199
00:08:43,813 --> 00:08:45,247
And then...
Yeah.

200
00:08:45,315 --> 00:08:47,249
(gasps) she's back at work?
Mm-hmm.

201
00:08:47,317 --> 00:08:49,251
Oh, if that
had happened to me,

202
00:08:49,319 --> 00:08:51,186
I'd be spending my time
in a padded room.

203
00:08:51,254 --> 00:08:52,854
Oh, is that the father?

204
00:08:52,922 --> 00:08:55,691
Yeah. Well, one of 'em.
T-there's another one?

205
00:08:55,758 --> 00:08:58,593
It's complicated.
(laughs) this place
is better than a telenovela.

206
00:08:58,661 --> 00:09:01,563
It's not a telenovela.
(laughs)

207
00:09:03,499 --> 00:09:05,334
Addison?
Dr. Montgomery.

208
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:07,369
Morgan.
Is everything okay?

209
00:09:07,437 --> 00:09:10,772
What's--what's wrong?
Did you do it?
Did you sleep with my husband?

210
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,407
Uh, ahem.

211
00:09:12,475 --> 00:09:14,876
Morgan, let's, uh--
uh, I k--he says you didn't.

212
00:09:14,944 --> 00:09:17,112
And I-I just want to believe
you didn't,

213
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,715
You being my doctor and all,

214
00:09:19,782 --> 00:09:21,984
But then I found myself
outside your building.

215
00:09:22,051 --> 00:09:24,886
And I knew if I didn't
ask you... Tell me.
Morgan, no.

216
00:09:24,954 --> 00:09:27,556
I promise you, nothing like
that ever happened.

217
00:09:27,623 --> 00:09:30,425
He's telling you the truth.

218
00:09:30,493 --> 00:09:33,195
I-I-I believe you.

219
00:09:33,262 --> 00:09:34,696
I'm sorry.

220
00:09:34,764 --> 00:09:38,033
I have to go.

221
00:09:39,802 --> 00:09:42,804
Go ahead.
Get it off your chest.
I have nothing to say.

222
00:09:42,872 --> 00:09:45,374
He was a heart surgeon.
She was my patient.

223
00:09:45,441 --> 00:09:47,275
It's none of my business.

224
00:09:47,343 --> 00:09:49,277
There was no sex at all.
Nothing.

225
00:09:49,345 --> 00:09:52,180
Okay, well, we--we--
we went to first base.

226
00:09:52,248 --> 00:09:53,682
Maybe second.

227
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,251
Se--somewhere between
first and second base--

228
00:09:56,319 --> 00:09:58,754
I do not want to know
about your bases or your balls.

229
00:09:58,821 --> 00:10:03,125
<i>It's none of my business.
Miranda, it's you. It's me.
I know you.</i>

230
00:10:03,192 --> 00:10:06,094
<i>I know you have something
to say.</i>

231
00:10:06,162 --> 00:10:08,230
(knock on door)
excuse me.
We got emily's tests back.

232
00:10:08,297 --> 00:10:10,232
Oh, good.
Bad.

233
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:14,369
Why? What happened?
Emily can't donate her kidney.

234
00:10:14,437 --> 00:10:15,937
(knock on door)

235
00:10:16,005 --> 00:10:20,409
Excuse me. Emily, could I
speak with you for a moment?

236
00:10:20,476 --> 00:10:22,511
Told you they'd find out.

237
00:10:22,578 --> 00:10:24,846
Wait. So you're aware of--
of emily's status?

238
00:10:24,914 --> 00:10:27,182
She's my sister. She knows
everything about me.

239
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,886
So it was only your doctors you
were keeping the secret from--

240
00:10:30,953 --> 00:10:32,821
The fact that you're
h.I.V. Positive?

241
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:35,223
Doesn't matter.
The transplant n to happen.

242
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:38,827
You said it yourself,
dr. Bailey. I'm out of time.

243
00:10:38,895 --> 00:10:41,263
I'd rather get a.I.D.S.
Than die.

244
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,316
I can't believe they lied.

245
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,852
Well, can you blame 'em?

246
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,854
Can you put sarah
back on dialysis?

247
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:58,356
No, no. We're at the end
of the line.

248
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,392
I called
the national kidney registry,

249
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,395
But, you know, she's been
waiting three years for a match.

250
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:04,897
They don't have one.
What about a cadaver donor?

251
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:07,066
No match. Nothing close.

252
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:10,570
We just hope someone dies
between now and the morning

253
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:12,438
Or we...

254
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:15,441
Give sarah emily's kidney.

255
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:17,610
(chuckles) yeah.

256
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:21,881
You can't transplant
an h.I.V.-Infected organ.

257
00:11:21,949 --> 00:11:23,950
If you put h.I.V
into her body

258
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,985
And then bombard
her immune system

259
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:27,453
With anti-rejection drugs,

260
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:29,722
She's not just looking
at living with h.I.V.

261
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,757
She could develop
full-blown a.I.D.S.

262
00:11:30,825 --> 00:11:32,726
Before she even leaves
the hospital.

263
00:11:32,794 --> 00:11:35,896
She could. Or she could
live with h.I.V.

264
00:11:35,964 --> 00:11:37,898
For the rest of her life
and be fine.

265
00:11:37,966 --> 00:11:39,867
What about emily?
She's already been compromised.

266
00:11:39,934 --> 00:11:41,869
I mean, is there data
that tells us

267
00:11:41,936 --> 00:11:44,304
What losing a kidney does
to someone with h.I.V.?

268
00:11:44,372 --> 00:11:46,807
What part of "there is no time"
do you not understand?

269
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:48,876
What part of "illegal"
do you not understand?

270
00:11:48,943 --> 00:11:50,878
Oh, the laws were created
years ago,

271
00:11:50,945 --> 00:11:53,380
Back when h.I.V.
Was a death sentence.

272
00:11:53,448 --> 00:11:55,149
They're outdated.
Out--

273
00:11:55,216 --> 00:11:57,818
It's not relevant. A.I.D.S.
Is treatable now, okay?

274
00:11:57,886 --> 00:12:00,621
Death isn't.
You are playing god.

275
00:12:00,688 --> 00:12:05,125
I'm a surgeon.
It's how we pass the time.
Dr. Bailey, we both want
to save your patient.

276
00:12:05,193 --> 00:12:07,761
But you can't expect me
to back you on this.

277
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:10,564
I'm putting my foot down. Okay?
My--my--my foot is down.

278
00:12:10,632 --> 00:12:13,433
Your foot is down?
Your foot is down?

279
00:12:13,501 --> 00:12:15,903
Oh, oh, no. You better
pick that foot up

280
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:18,305
And use it
to walk away from me.

281
00:12:20,008 --> 00:12:22,009
(cooper) you're
the infectious disease guy.

282
00:12:22,076 --> 00:12:24,611
You gotta help me out here.
There's gotta be something.

283
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:26,780
He's not ready yet.
It's one dance.

284
00:12:26,848 --> 00:12:29,616
And then his girl's gonna
be there with some other guy.

285
00:12:29,684 --> 00:12:32,452
Lisa baxter--she was
my lab partner in chem,

286
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,289
Which was great,
because normally a guy like me

287
00:12:35,356 --> 00:12:37,758
Would not have a chance
with a girl like lisa.

288
00:12:37,825 --> 00:12:40,260
But, you know, I made her laugh,
so we got to talk.

289
00:12:40,328 --> 00:12:42,262
And she realized
my inherent charms.

290
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:45,265
Anyway... I get up the nerve
to ask her to winter formal,

291
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:48,168
And she says yes right before
my parents tell me

292
00:12:48,236 --> 00:12:51,138
That we're going to des moines
to my cousin ira's bar mitzvah.
My heart's breaking, coop.

293
00:12:51,206 --> 00:12:53,640
Okay, well, that was it.
By the time I got back,

294
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,842
She was dating this beefy guy
named ted,

295
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:58,478
And I never got my shot.
Are we doing this
for you or for him?

296
00:12:58,546 --> 00:13:00,814
Oh, don't grow up on me now,
pete. His count's borderline.

297
00:13:00,882 --> 00:13:03,784
You boost people all the time.
You know it could help.

298
00:13:03,851 --> 00:13:05,786
And if his numbers
are normal...

299
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:07,921
Come on. Let's let the kid
get the girl.

300
00:13:15,663 --> 00:13:16,897
Violet.

301
00:13:21,402 --> 00:13:23,503
(sighs)

302
00:13:23,571 --> 00:13:25,472
I am unimaginably sorry

303
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,075
About what happened
to you, violet.

304
00:13:28,142 --> 00:13:31,044
And I'm sorry you and pete
aren't working out,

305
00:13:31,112 --> 00:13:34,348
But... You gave away a child
that wasn't yours to give.

306
00:13:34,415 --> 00:13:36,984
I mean, I-it could be,
but--but we don't know.

307
00:13:37,051 --> 00:13:38,518
And I need to know.

308
00:13:38,586 --> 00:13:41,588
I need to know, violet,
if he's my son.

309
00:13:45,593 --> 00:13:48,462
I want you to agree
to a paternity test.

310
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:50,330
Okay.

311
00:13:50,398 --> 00:13:52,232
What?

312
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,734
Fine.

313
00:13:53,801 --> 00:13:56,536
Whatever. Do it.

314
00:14:02,644 --> 00:14:04,544
So what do we think,

315
00:14:04,612 --> 00:14:06,213
Corsage or no corsage?

316
00:14:06,281 --> 00:14:07,881
(cooper and pete) no corsage.

317
00:14:07,949 --> 00:14:10,050
I kinda like the idea
of pinning it on. You know...

318
00:14:10,118 --> 00:14:12,552
Yeah, we know...
(chuckles) romeo.

319
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,955
And I'm done.
I'm gonna be good?

320
00:14:15,023 --> 00:14:17,958
Well, we'll see. Your c-d-4
has to be above 200.

321
00:14:18,026 --> 00:14:21,695
So what do you think,
kiss her while we're dancing

322
00:14:21,763 --> 00:14:23,997
Or wait
and take her outside after?

323
00:14:25,867 --> 00:14:27,434
What?

324
00:14:27,502 --> 00:14:30,504
Look, I... I want him
to be happy.

325
00:14:30,571 --> 00:14:32,839
He's kept
such a good attitude.

326
00:14:32,907 --> 00:14:35,309
I thought it would be
easier this time

327
00:14:35,376 --> 00:14:37,477
Because I'd been through it.

328
00:14:37,545 --> 00:14:39,746
That was stupid.

329
00:14:39,814 --> 00:14:43,483
The idea of losing your child
doesn't get easier.

330
00:14:46,988 --> 00:14:49,156
You have kids?

331
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:50,290
Yes.

332
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,192
Then you know.

333
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,461
Yes.              That feeling.

334
00:14:56,931 --> 00:14:59,499
She's getting worse.

335
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:01,501
We've contacted
every donor list.

336
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:03,503
Hopefully we'll find
another match.

337
00:15:03,571 --> 00:15:04,971
And when they don't?

338
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:06,473
Let's cross that bridge...

339
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,442
(sighs)

340
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:12,245
<i>(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.A.)</i>

341
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:15,881
Are you okay?

342
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:18,417
I've spent
the past 12 hours

343
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:20,653
Thinking about death.

344
00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:22,621
Sarah dying tomorrow,

345
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:25,024
Emily's h.I.V.
Turning into a.I.D.S.

346
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:26,525
And her dying

347
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,494
And leaving her three babies
with no one,

348
00:15:28,562 --> 00:15:30,563
Someone dying
so I can have a kidney.

349
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,598
I've been sitting in the e.R.

350
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:37,336
Just hoping some 24 year old
on a motorcycle with no helmet

351
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:39,305
Bites it on the freeway

352
00:15:39,373 --> 00:15:41,974
And by some miracle
is a match.

353
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:45,111
I'm sick
of thinking about death.

354
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,122
(knocks on doorjamb)
I want a paternity test.

355
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:58,157
Have you talked to violet?

356
00:15:58,225 --> 00:16:00,593
I have her consent, yeah.
Okay, what about pete?

357
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,028
What about me what?

358
00:16:02,096 --> 00:16:05,599
I want addison to perform
a paternity test on lucas.
No.

359
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:08,368
How soon can you do this?
I said no.

360
00:16:08,436 --> 00:16:11,405
Uh, guys, guys, let's just
take a deep breath.
If I take any more breaths,
I'm gonna hyperventilate.

361
00:16:11,472 --> 00:16:13,907
Just do the test.
Addison, you can't do this.
You don't have--

362
00:16:13,975 --> 00:16:16,543
Then I'll get someone else.
I want to know.

363
00:16:16,611 --> 00:16:19,513
Well, I know. I look at him
and I already know.
You want me
to diagnose that, pete?

364
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,882
It's denial.
You asked me
to take care of them.

365
00:16:21,949 --> 00:16:24,217
(addison) okay, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.
That's what I've been doing.

366
00:16:24,285 --> 00:16:27,387
When she was with you. I didn't
say you could raise my child.
He's not your child!

367
00:16:27,455 --> 00:16:29,256
I will get a lawyer
if I have to.

368
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:31,158
I have the mother's consent.
(pete) don't do it.

369
00:16:31,225 --> 00:16:34,060
All right, guys, guys.
It doesn't have to--
do the test.

370
00:16:34,128 --> 00:16:37,063
Sheldon, please.
We don't have to go this far.

371
00:16:37,131 --> 00:16:40,300
(exhales deeply)
I hate this day.

372
00:16:43,854 --> 00:16:45,788
I'm sorry
about your patient.

373
00:16:45,856 --> 00:16:49,458
<i>I figured I'd pour you
a glass more than half-full.</i>

374
00:16:49,526 --> 00:16:52,361
When did you become
an optimist?

375
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:54,265
I'm not. I just saw
that you were brooding.

376
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,734
Oh. Not brooding.

377
00:16:58,802 --> 00:17:01,237
Just checking out
the local scenery.

378
00:17:01,304 --> 00:17:04,674
Am not.
I do not check out scenery.

379
00:17:04,741 --> 00:17:07,109
I think it's great.
You're single. He's single.

380
00:17:07,177 --> 00:17:09,045
I mean, you know,
there were sparks.

381
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:10,880
Just tell me something.

382
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:14,016
Just tell me how come
all anybody thinks about is sex?

383
00:17:14,084 --> 00:17:16,018
Why is that
all you doctors do,

384
00:17:16,086 --> 00:17:18,688
Sleep with each other?
I did not sleep with noah.

385
00:17:18,755 --> 00:17:21,590
(scoffs)
okay, look, maybe I thought
about sleeping with him,

386
00:17:21,658 --> 00:17:23,959
But I didn't do it. I did
the right thing this time.

387
00:17:24,027 --> 00:17:26,929
I did not sleep with him. I
tried to fire her as a patient.

388
00:17:26,997 --> 00:17:29,231
I stopped things with noah
before they went too far.

389
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:31,100
For the record,
in case you're wondering.

390
00:17:31,168 --> 00:17:33,803
I wasn't.
Okay, you know, you think
you're doing me a favor

391
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:36,605
By not saying anything, but it's
written all over your face.

392
00:17:36,673 --> 00:17:41,177
So you might as well just say it
before your head explodes.
Husband's best friend,
patient's husband--

393
00:17:41,244 --> 00:17:43,345
Where I come from, that's
called a bad t record.

394
00:17:43,413 --> 00:17:45,514
Me poor woman's marching
around your office building

395
00:17:45,582 --> 00:17:47,516
With a baby
trying to figure out

396
00:17:47,584 --> 00:17:49,485
What the hell happened
to her marriage,

397
00:17:49,553 --> 00:17:52,621
And you want a gold star
'cause you did the right thing.

398
00:17:52,689 --> 00:17:55,691
You acting like a tramp,
you don't get a gold star.

399
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:57,359
You asked.

400
00:17:59,096 --> 00:18:01,430
Are you okay?

401
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:04,033
I'm glass half-empty,
and we're not talking about it.

402
00:18:04,101 --> 00:18:06,435
Okay.

403
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:07,970
(sighs)

404
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:09,772
* is it the thunder *

405
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,041
* that brings fear? *

406
00:18:12,109 --> 00:18:14,243
* is it the sparrow *

407
00:18:14,311 --> 00:18:16,512
* that brings music... *

408
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,081
Leave me out of this,
please.

409
00:18:19,149 --> 00:18:21,550
The birth certificate
has no father's name.

410
00:18:21,618 --> 00:18:23,219
This is a change form.

411
00:18:23,286 --> 00:18:25,888
I put my name down as father.
I need you to sign it.

412
00:18:25,956 --> 00:18:28,324
You have to work this out
with sheldon.
Sign the paper, violet.

413
00:18:28,391 --> 00:18:31,227
You owe me that much.
You owe lucas that much.

414
00:18:31,294 --> 00:18:33,796
I'm his father

415
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:35,431
J-just sign it.

416
00:18:35,499 --> 00:18:38,601
You need to work this out
with sheldon.

417
00:18:38,668 --> 00:18:40,402
* his love... *

418
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,037
I'm sorry.

419
00:18:42,105 --> 00:18:44,306
* that made it begin *

420
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:46,308
* for the first time *

421
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:47,877
* and his love... *

422
00:18:47,944 --> 00:18:49,011
Mm.

423
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:50,479
* set it right *

424
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:55,050
* to keep us going on *

425
00:18:55,118 --> 00:18:56,585
* but we keep... *

426
00:18:56,653 --> 00:18:58,053
Where you going?

427
00:18:58,121 --> 00:18:59,221
Home.

428
00:18:59,289 --> 00:19:00,356
Why?

429
00:19:00,423 --> 00:19:02,792
'cause that's where I live.

430
00:19:02,859 --> 00:19:06,095
Come on.
I thought we could talk.
About what?

431
00:19:06,163 --> 00:19:07,563
About, uh...

432
00:19:07,631 --> 00:19:10,533
I don't know. Just talk.

433
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,501
This is every man's dream--

434
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:16,105
Me, no strings, no talk,
just sex.

435
00:19:16,173 --> 00:19:19,108
You are a lucky, lucky man.

436
00:19:19,176 --> 00:19:21,677
Hey, hey.
I want you, charlotte.

437
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:25,648
Not just in my bed, I want
to be your boyfriend again.

438
00:19:25,715 --> 00:19:27,917
I know you got hurt.
You called me--

439
00:19:27,984 --> 00:19:29,919
It was a moment, cooper,
a moment.

440
00:19:29,986 --> 00:19:33,255
And then violet got attacked,
and the moment passed.

441
00:19:33,323 --> 00:19:35,691
Right now
I'm dealing with this my way.

442
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:38,093
Just go with it.

443
00:19:38,161 --> 00:19:43,432
* ...From his side *

444
00:19:50,306 --> 00:19:52,540
Addison.

445
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,909
(clears throat)

446
00:19:54,977 --> 00:19:57,111
I'm embarrassed.

447
00:19:57,179 --> 00:19:59,814
I shouldn't have
barged in here yesterday.

448
00:19:59,882 --> 00:20:01,916
That's just not something
I would normally do.

449
00:20:01,984 --> 00:20:03,918
I-I would call first.

450
00:20:03,986 --> 00:20:06,721
And bringing the baby with me
like that wasn't right.

451
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:09,824
Lately, uh, nothing I do
makes much sense.

452
00:20:09,892 --> 00:20:11,126
You don't...
Have to apologize.

453
00:20:11,194 --> 00:20:14,697
You had every right
to ask the question.

454
00:20:14,764 --> 00:20:17,199
I just hope
that you believe me.
I do. I think I do.

455
00:20:17,267 --> 00:20:20,336
Good. Good.
Because whatever happened...

456
00:20:20,403 --> 00:20:23,539
You know, I just never wanted
to make things harder.

457
00:20:23,607 --> 00:20:25,507
I don't want to be
that person, you know?

458
00:20:25,575 --> 00:20:28,510
I mean, I hope you know
that... Because we didn't--

459
00:20:28,578 --> 00:20:31,180
I just hope it helps,
you know?

460
00:20:31,248 --> 00:20:34,717
I hope you and noah...
Get--put this behind you.

461
00:20:34,784 --> 00:20:37,152
I hope so.

462
00:20:47,196 --> 00:20:49,931
This is cruel. Tell me.

463
00:20:51,934 --> 00:20:54,435
Ladies and gentlemen...

464
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:57,105
204.
Yes!

465
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,974
Now you're right on the border,
but you can kiss the girl.

466
00:21:00,042 --> 00:21:02,243
Mom, mom, I'm going.

467
00:21:02,311 --> 00:21:04,045
I gotta call kelli.

468
00:21:04,113 --> 00:21:05,880
Are you okay?

469
00:21:05,948 --> 00:21:08,583
I'm fine. I...

470
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:11,703
Ryan.
What?

471
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,038
Wait.

472
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:16,775
What?
Your mom has a fever.

473
00:21:16,843 --> 00:21:19,678
You're burning up.
You could have the flu.

474
00:21:19,746 --> 00:21:22,147
(wom) I'm sorry, ry.
I'm so sorry.

475
00:21:22,215 --> 00:21:24,449
I thought it was a headache.
No!

476
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:27,486
His numbers are there.
His system's compromised.

477
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:30,422
I'm fine. I feel fine.
Ryan, there'll be
other dances.

478
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,693
I asked you for a consult,

479
00:21:34,761 --> 00:21:37,663
Not to make decisions without consulting me.
You're trying so hard to be his friend,

480
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:40,632
You've lost sight of what's best for him.
Having a life is what's best for him,

481
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,135
And seeing that girl is what's best for him.
And what's best for his mother,

482
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:45,537
Risking her son's life
so he can get kissed?

483
00:21:45,605 --> 00:21:48,840
That's her kid, cooper. Can you imagine what she goes through?
Look, pete, I know you're a dad now

484
00:21:48,908 --> 00:21:50,776
And it's a big, bad world
out there,

485
00:21:50,843 --> 00:21:53,745
But you want to tell me
what's going on here?

486
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,847
Sheldon wants
a paternity test.

487
00:21:55,915 --> 00:21:58,016
Violet said yes.

488
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:06,425
Her "t" waves are peaked.
Potassium's togh.

489
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:10,729
Her organs
are shutting down.

490
00:22:10,797 --> 00:22:14,533
Okay, uh, let's increase
her morphine.

491
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,803
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

492
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,905
No.

493
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:25,610
Bailey, look at me.
You can't.

494
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:27,079
Sh-she's dying.

495
00:22:27,146 --> 00:22:29,548
There isn't another kidney
to transplant.

496
00:22:29,615 --> 00:22:31,550
Okay, just no more waiting.

497
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:33,719
Just... They both know
the risks.

498
00:22:33,786 --> 00:22:35,821
You think charlotte king
is gonna let you do

499
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:38,457
An illegal surgery?
I've dealt with tougher chiefs than charlotte king.

500
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:41,126
What, so that's it?
You--you feel guilty,

501
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:44,463
So you're just gonna forget
what everybody else has to say,

502
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,232
Forget about the law, forget--
I don't have time for this.

503
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,234
Yeah, walk away, bailey.
Just walk away.

504
00:22:49,302 --> 00:22:51,236
You--you know what?
No, you're--you're right.

505
00:22:51,304 --> 00:22:53,805
When I first got here, I was
guilty about what happened.

506
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:55,807
But I was acting as a doctor,

507
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,976
A surgeon, 'cause that's my job...
Oh.

508
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:01,613
To cut through the bull and save the patient.
Please don't pull the surgeon card.

509
00:23:01,681 --> 00:23:03,615
We're all doctors
around here.

510
00:23:03,683 --> 00:23:05,617
It's a personality thing.
Okay, yeah.

511
00:23:05,685 --> 00:23:09,254
I-I've seen you long enough
to see that you're good,

512
00:23:09,322 --> 00:23:11,757
But you hang back,
you watch, you decide.

513
00:23:11,824 --> 00:23:13,759
I act.

514
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:17,329
I don't stand outside a room
watching my life pass me by,

515
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:21,600
And I won't stand by
and watch this patient die.

516
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:26,755
This isn't about lawsuits

517
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:28,657
Or red tape
or hospital bureaucracy.

518
00:23:28,725 --> 00:23:31,593
This is about a girl
who came to us for help,

519
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:33,595
And we couldn't give it.

520
00:23:33,663 --> 00:23:37,766
And now we're telling she
to just die quietly.

521
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:39,735
Seattle grace
is on the hook here

522
00:23:39,802 --> 00:23:41,370
If this girl dies.

523
00:23:41,437 --> 00:23:43,805
The law is antiquated here,
and you know it.

524
00:23:43,873 --> 00:23:46,742
The question is,
are you a by-the-book chief

525
00:23:46,809 --> 00:23:49,645
Or a do-what's-right chief?
This usually works for you,

526
00:23:49,712 --> 00:23:52,080
This kind of blatant manipulation?
Usually.

527
00:23:52,148 --> 00:23:53,882
Yeah, me, too.

528
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:56,952
This is the right thing to do,
the human thing.

529
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:00,188
I'll talk to some staff, see if
I can get a team together.

530
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:02,024
What the hell, right?

531
00:24:02,091 --> 00:24:04,893
What are they gonna do, drag us
off to jail for saving lives?

532
00:24:04,961 --> 00:24:07,129
They might.

533
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:10,365
Addison was wrong
about you.

534
00:24:12,335 --> 00:24:14,736
(door opens)

535
00:24:14,804 --> 00:24:18,006
What are you doing?
You just gonna let sheldon

536
00:24:18,074 --> 00:24:20,642
Go ahead and have
a paternity test?
Yes.

537
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:23,378
You gave the baby to pete.
You can't just--

538
00:24:23,446 --> 00:24:25,580
I can. I did. It's done.

539
00:24:25,648 --> 00:24:28,650
No, we have to talk about this.
We're gonna talk about this.
Don't, don't, don't,
don't touch me.

540
00:24:28,718 --> 00:24:30,786
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

541
00:24:30,853 --> 00:24:34,022
I cannot let you just toss
your child to the wind.
Okay, well, what do
you want from me?

542
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:36,958
I want you to care, violet.
This is your child.

543
00:24:37,026 --> 00:24:38,927
Don't you think
I want to care?

544
00:24:38,995 --> 00:24:41,763
Don't you think I would
give anything to care,

545
00:24:41,831 --> 00:24:45,033
To have a feeling, to be happy,
sad, angry, anything?

546
00:24:45,101 --> 00:24:46,501
I...

547
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:50,639
I can't feel anything,
cooper.

548
00:24:50,707 --> 00:24:52,908
Do you know
what that's like?

549
00:24:52,975 --> 00:24:54,910
It's like not being able
to taste.

550
00:24:54,977 --> 00:24:57,045
It's like remembering
what food is like.

551
00:24:57,113 --> 00:24:59,948
Like you can smell chocolate,
but you can't taste it.

552
00:25:00,016 --> 00:25:02,884
You can't get the sensation
when it's on your tongue.

553
00:25:02,952 --> 00:25:04,486
I want to care.

554
00:25:04,554 --> 00:25:07,756
I want to be a person
who cares about her son.

555
00:25:07,824 --> 00:25:10,659
But my insides are dead.

556
00:25:10,727 --> 00:25:13,562
I am rotting
from the inside out.

557
00:25:13,629 --> 00:25:16,031
And I wish
there was some pill,

558
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:18,400
There was something
to fix this,

559
00:25:18,468 --> 00:25:20,368
But there isn't.

560
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:23,305
All I have is my work.

561
00:25:23,372 --> 00:25:26,308
So please... Please...

562
00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:30,045
Just let me do my work.

563
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:31,513
Just...

564
00:25:31,581 --> 00:25:33,849
(joey ryan)
* maybe we'll come outta this *

565
00:25:33,916 --> 00:25:37,219
* unscathed *

566
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,421
(lucas crying)

567
00:25:39,489 --> 00:25:41,890
* just like the story said *

568
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:46,094

569
00:25:46,162 --> 00:25:47,562
(crying stops)

570
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:48,630
* okay *

571
00:25:48,698 --> 00:25:50,265
* yes, and I know *

572
00:25:50,333 --> 00:25:52,200
Hey.

573
00:25:52,268 --> 00:25:56,138
I heard, uh, the baby crying.
Sorry. I...

574
00:25:56,205 --> 00:25:58,073
Addison.

575
00:25:58,141 --> 00:25:59,241
Yeah.

576
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:01,743
Are you okay?
What's going on with you?

577
00:26:01,811 --> 00:26:04,045
Nothing. I'm fine, nai.
No, you're not.

578
00:26:04,113 --> 00:26:05,747
(sighs)

579
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:07,716
* ...Make it alone *

580
00:26:07,784 --> 00:26:11,086
Look, I went downstairs
because I needed to.

581
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:12,888
It was something I had to do.

582
00:26:12,955 --> 00:26:15,824
I did it for me,
not to hurt you.

583
00:26:15,892 --> 00:26:18,693
I want to get past this.
It's not about that.

584
00:26:18,761 --> 00:26:21,897
Then what? I have been asking.
I have been trying.

585
00:26:21,964 --> 00:26:25,367
I can't. I...

586
00:26:25,434 --> 00:26:27,702
I just can't.

587
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:29,671
*

588
00:26:29,739 --> 00:26:32,674
(breathing heavily)

589
00:26:36,612 --> 00:26:38,013
(blows air)

590
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,816
* look at your reflection *

591
00:26:40,883 --> 00:26:46,021
* casting your own image
in the stream *

592
00:26:46,088 --> 00:26:47,522
(exhales)

593
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,790
Morgan.

594
00:26:48,858 --> 00:26:51,526
All the way home,
I kept trying to figure out

595
00:26:51,594 --> 00:26:54,462
Why I don't feel better.
Did you, uh, you want
to go into my office?

596
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,598
<i>Oh, where you
feel more comfortable?</i>

597
00:26:56,666 --> 00:26:58,800
No, I don't.

598
00:26:58,868 --> 00:27:01,736
I kn what you said,
and... Y-you'd think

599
00:27:01,804 --> 00:27:03,672
That knowing your husband
had stayed faithful

600
00:27:03,739 --> 00:27:05,707
Would--would be a relief,

601
00:27:05,775 --> 00:27:07,275
But I feel worse.

602
00:27:07,343 --> 00:27:09,211
I feel worse
because if it was sex,

603
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:11,346
He could get over sex.

604
00:27:11,414 --> 00:27:15,016
Sex is biological.
Sex is carnal.

605
00:27:15,084 --> 00:27:18,053
Sex is... Forgivable.

606
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,056
But I see
what this did to him,

607
00:27:21,123 --> 00:27:23,859
And I see the look
in your eyes,

608
00:27:23,926 --> 00:27:27,462
And I keep thinking,
if it wasn't sex...

609
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:30,932
Did you...

610
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,501
Do you love him?

611
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:36,371
* ...Make it alone *

612
00:27:36,439 --> 00:27:38,473
Damn it.
But we didn't--

613
00:27:38,541 --> 00:27:41,643
Have sex? What does it matter
if he thinks about you?

614
00:27:41,711 --> 00:27:44,079
He thinks about you.

615
00:27:44,146 --> 00:27:46,581
No matter what he says,
no matter what he does...

616
00:27:46,649 --> 00:27:49,317
(voice breaking)
for the rest of our marriage,

617
00:27:49,385 --> 00:27:51,319
You're gonna be there
in my head.

618
00:27:51,387 --> 00:27:54,122
I'm gonna be wondering
if he's thinking about you.

619
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:56,224
(normal voice)
you said nothing happened.

620
00:27:56,292 --> 00:27:59,961
It's a lie,
and you know it.

621
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,935
I know dr. King
asked for your help,

622
00:28:07,003 --> 00:28:08,904
But I just want to reiterate,

623
00:28:08,971 --> 00:28:11,206
There could be
negative ramifications

624
00:28:11,274 --> 00:28:13,275
If you assist
in this operation.

625
00:28:13,342 --> 00:28:16,344
So if any one of you
want to back out,

626
00:28:16,412 --> 00:28:19,147
Now would be the time.

627
00:28:22,685 --> 00:28:25,220
I'm sorry.

628
00:28:25,288 --> 00:28:28,556
I won't tell anyone,
but I can't do this.

629
00:28:33,663 --> 00:28:36,398
We'll do it without him.
I can only back you
so far.

630
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:39,401
Without a proper team,
it's a no go.

631
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:41,970
Uh, she has a full team.

632
00:28:42,038 --> 00:28:44,506
I did a surgical residency.

633
00:28:44,573 --> 00:28:48,510
I didn't always
stand by and watch.

634
00:28:50,813 --> 00:28:53,281
Okay, we're losing time.
Let's scrub in.

635
00:28:55,918 --> 00:28:57,852
I'm turning into that guy

636
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,821
That calls the cops
on a party.

637
00:28:59,889 --> 00:29:01,556
No.

638
00:29:01,624 --> 00:29:04,359
You're turning
into a father--

639
00:29:04,427 --> 00:29:06,161
A good father, you know?

640
00:29:06,228 --> 00:29:08,964
I mean, you're probably right
about ryan. I just--

641
00:29:09,031 --> 00:29:10,865
He's a good kid,
and I like him,

642
00:29:10,933 --> 00:29:12,834
And I want to see him
and, uh...

643
00:29:12,902 --> 00:29:14,602
Oh, my god.

644
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,738
I think I'm actually
jealous of this kid

645
00:29:16,806 --> 00:29:19,774
And his relationship
with his girlfriend.

646
00:29:19,842 --> 00:29:21,743
It's pathetic.
That is pathetic.

647
00:29:21,811 --> 00:29:24,212
(cell phone rings and beeps)

648
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,247
Hi, betty.
No, no, no, no.

649
00:29:26,315 --> 00:29:28,216
You stay where you are.
We'll go.

650
00:29:28,284 --> 00:29:30,251
Yeah, I'll call you.

651
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:33,455
Ryan's gone,
and so is his suit.

Ryan.

692
00:31:04,741 --> 00:31:06,409
He's pale and diaphoretic.
Sinus tach at 114.

693
00:31:06,476 --> 00:31:08,277
Neuro's intact.
His glucose is 88.

694
00:31:08,345 --> 00:31:10,279
Let's get him a c.B.C.,
chem-pan and culture him up.

695
00:31:10,347 --> 00:31:12,782
Okay, bolus a liter of saline
and get a cooling blanket.

696
00:31:12,849 --> 00:31:15,017
Come on.
Pulse ox is 88.
Get him on a high-flow mask.

697
00:31:15,085 --> 00:31:18,087
Ryan. Ryan, come on.
Stay with us, ryan. Hey!

Best night of my life.

699
00:31:21,291 --> 00:31:24,560
Pressure's dropping. Let's set
him up for a central line.

700
00:31:24,628 --> 00:31:27,930
We gotta get him
into an iso room.
On my count. One, two, three.

701
00:31:31,201 --> 00:31:34,236
We're gonna
put you under now.

702
00:31:34,304 --> 00:31:36,605
Take good care of her, okay?
How about you tell us

703
00:31:36,673 --> 00:31:39,342
About those beautiful babies
of yours,

704
00:31:39,409 --> 00:31:41,377

she's the oldest.

Yeah. Waiting to hear
from bailey.

712
00:32:04,134 --> 00:32:07,002

a ride back from the hospital.

I got it. I got it.
Okay.

Must be nice t a baby.

718
00:32:18,915 --> 00:32:20,649
Haven't made any mistakes,

719
00:32:20,717 --> 00:32:22,518

721
00:32:23,887 --> 00:32:25,888
Said anything
you can't take back.

drive down to mexico

731
00:32:50,113 --> 00:32:53,115
It's tough to do
the right thing.

732
00:32:58,688 --> 00:33:00,589

735
00:33:07,846 --> 00:33:09,781
Is everything okay?

736
00:33:09,848 --> 00:33:12,350
I couldn't sleep.
I-I couldn't... Be alone.

737
00:33:12,418 --> 00:33:14,319
I had to get
out of that house.

738
00:33:14,386 --> 00:33:16,654
Look, you may not get it,
'cause, um,

739
00:33:16,722 --> 00:33:18,590
Well, you're a mother
and, um...

740
00:33:18,657 --> 00:33:20,091
You love your kid.

741
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,527
And you're--you're good,

742
00:33:22,595 --> 00:33:24,462
So you may not get it.

743
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:26,698
But, um, you know,
you know me,

744
00:33:26,765 --> 00:33:30,168
And you haven't tried to...

745
00:33:30,235 --> 00:33:32,170
I need a friend.

746
00:33:32,237 --> 00:33:35,707
I just--I need a friend
who will let me sit

747
00:33:35,774 --> 00:33:39,544
And maybe drink
and not talk about anything.

748
00:33:39,612 --> 00:33:41,346
Do you get that?

749
00:33:41,413 --> 00:33:44,148
I do.

750
00:33:44,216 --> 00:33:47,051
I get it.

751
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:48,653
More suction.

752
00:33:48,721 --> 00:33:50,655
I need to see
what I'm doing.

753
00:33:50,723 --> 00:33:54,392
All right,
retract the rectus muscle.

754
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:57,762
I'm placing the kidney.

755
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:01,833
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

756
00:34:04,303 --> 00:34:07,205
Okay.

00:34:07,272 --> 00:34:09,107
(monitor beeping erratically)

758
00:34:09,174 --> 00:34:11,976
All right, her blood pressure's
opping. 90 over 60.

759
00:34:12,044 --> 00:34:15,279
She's throwing p.V.C.S?
What the hell?
All right.

760
00:34:15,347 --> 00:34:18,249
Her neck veins are distended.
It's pericardial tamponade.

761
00:34:18,317 --> 00:34:20,852
You need a pericardial window
to drain the fluid

762
00:34:20,919 --> 00:34:22,387
From around her heart.

763
00:34:22,454 --> 00:34:24,355
All right, someone page
a cardiothoracic surgeon.

764
00:34:24,423 --> 00:34:26,457
No, there's no time.
Betadine.

765
00:34:26,525 --> 00:34:30,695
Give me a 15 blade
and a metz.
What--what are you doing?
We need a surgeon.

766
00:34:30,763 --> 00:34:33,498
I've done this before.
I can do this. 15 blade.
Are you out of your mind?

767
00:34:33,565 --> 00:34:35,933
Give me the scalpel!

768
00:34:36,001 --> 00:34:38,569
2-inch vertical incision...

769
00:34:38,637 --> 00:34:41,839
Subxiphoid.

770
00:34:41,907 --> 00:34:44,542
Okay.

771
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:46,310
Peel the peritoneum...

772
00:34:46,378 --> 00:34:48,513
Off the diaphragm.

773
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,481
Okay. 11 blade.

774
00:34:50,549 --> 00:34:52,083
(beeping continues)

775
00:34:52,151 --> 00:34:56,387
Extend the incision.

776
00:34:56,455 --> 00:34:57,955
Pressure?

777
00:34:58,023 --> 00:35:01,893
70 over 50 and dropping.

778
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,595
(beeping continues)

779
00:35:04,663 --> 00:35:07,832
Damn it.
Well, keep doing
what you're doing.

780
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,133
Okay.

781
00:35:09,201 --> 00:35:11,402
Okay, I can feel the heart.
Got it.

782
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:14,439
All right, poole suction.

783
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,441
I got this. Come on.

784
00:35:16,508 --> 00:35:19,177
Come on now.Oole suction.

785
00:35:19,244 --> 00:35:21,045
Pressure's rising.

786
00:35:21,113 --> 00:35:22,413
80.

787
00:35:22,481 --> 00:35:25,116
90.

788
00:35:25,184 --> 00:35:28,219
I got it. I got it.

789
00:35:28,287 --> 00:35:30,054
Good. Okay.

790
00:35:30,122 --> 00:35:33,725
Why don't you go ahead
and connect that kidney?

791
00:35:33,792 --> 00:35:36,561
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

792
00:35:44,144 --> 00:35:46,213
What the hell
just happened in there?

793
00:35:46,281 --> 00:35:48,515
I did a surgical residency
in cardiothoracic.

794
00:35:48,583 --> 00:35:50,684
Well, haven't you ever--

795
00:35:50,752 --> 00:35:53,620
I don't talk about why.
Why is nobody's business.

796
00:35:53,688 --> 00:35:56,523
You are an infuriating...

797
00:35:56,591 --> 00:36:00,327
Tiny... Little woman.

798
00:36:00,395 --> 00:36:02,629
Excuse me.

799
00:36:04,699 --> 00:36:06,700
I'm gonna kiss you.

800
00:36:10,505 --> 00:36:11,872
Okay.

801
00:36:20,782 --> 00:36:23,283
(gasps)

802
00:36:23,351 --> 00:36:26,219
I--I'm sorry.

803
00:36:26,287 --> 00:36:28,188
I'm sorry.

804
00:36:28,256 --> 00:36:32,626
You think you have
everything all figured out.

805
00:36:32,694 --> 00:36:34,962
But you don't know anything,
do you?

806
00:36:35,029 --> 00:36:37,230
(chuckles)

807
00:36:39,467 --> 00:36:43,036
Uh... (sighs)

808
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:51,445
So these
two psychiatrists meet

809
00:36:51,512 --> 00:36:54,147
At their
20th college reunion, right?

810
00:36:54,215 --> 00:36:57,184
Uh... (chuckles)

811
00:36:57,251 --> 00:36:59,519
When I'm anxious,
sometimes I, uh...

812
00:36:59,587 --> 00:37:02,356
It's not
a very funny joke, really,

813
00:37:02,423 --> 00:37:04,791
Although the punch line
always makes me laugh.

814
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:06,927
It's a freudian slip.

815
00:37:10,832 --> 00:37:12,733
Look,
however this turns out--

816
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,267
We'll have the answer.

817
00:37:14,335 --> 00:37:16,203
Yes.

818
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:19,506
(kate earl's "learning to fly"
playing)

819
00:37:22,577 --> 00:37:26,013
Oh, thank god!

820
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,548
* I've made mistakes *

821
00:37:28,616 --> 00:37:31,551
* but I won't be ashamed *

822
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:34,721
* it feels like fate
is lifting me *

823
00:37:34,789 --> 00:37:38,358
I really thought
he had my ears.

824
00:37:38,426 --> 00:37:41,161
* I no longer hide *

825
00:37:41,229 --> 00:37:44,197
* so I let the sun
wash over me *

826
00:37:44,265 --> 00:37:48,201
* 'cause there's no darkness
left to hold me down *

827
00:37:48,269 --> 00:37:50,604
* and I feel it's light *

828
00:37:50,672 --> 00:37:53,340
* now I found the spark *

829
00:37:53,408 --> 00:37:56,576
* that was missing
in my life *

830
00:37:56,644 --> 00:37:59,046
* and I earned these wings *

831
00:37:59,113 --> 00:38:01,014
* I was not born with them *

832
00:38:01,082 --> 00:38:03,750
What are you doing here?

833
00:38:03,818 --> 00:38:06,019
Cooper, what are you doing?

834
00:38:06,087 --> 00:38:08,855
* ...Through the rain
and the fire *

835
00:38:08,923 --> 00:38:11,758
* 'cause it taught me
how to love *

836
00:38:11,826 --> 00:38:15,395
* it taught me how to fight *

837
00:38:15,463 --> 00:38:18,365
Wh--are you crazy?
Put me down.

838
00:38:18,433 --> 00:38:20,801
You're screwed up, charlotte.
I can't talk to you,

839
00:38:20,868 --> 00:38:23,270
And you can't talk to me,
and when I stand back

840
00:38:23,337 --> 00:38:26,840
And ask myself what
we're doing, I don't know.

841
00:38:26,908 --> 00:38:29,943
I just know you're worth it,
and I am the man.

842
00:38:30,011 --> 00:38:32,913
I am the man here. So I don't
care if you can talk to me.

843
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,882
And I don't care if you tell me
about getting fired or whatever.

844
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,884
I am taking my woman home
to our bed.

845
00:38:37,952 --> 00:38:40,020
You're moving in with me.
Cooper, wait--

846
00:38:40,088 --> 00:38:41,955
(mutters)
I'm getting the girl here.

847
00:38:42,023 --> 00:38:43,890
Don't ruin the moment for me.

848
00:38:43,958 --> 00:38:45,659
* ooh, ooh, ooh *

849
00:38:45,727 --> 00:38:50,897
* and finally
I'm learning to fly *

850
00:38:50,965 --> 00:38:53,600
Okay. I'm all packed.

851
00:38:53,668 --> 00:38:55,202
Uh...

852
00:38:55,269 --> 00:38:59,706
So sam used to be
a cardiothoracic surgeon?

853
00:38:59,774 --> 00:39:01,374
Yes.
And you were there

854
00:39:01,442 --> 00:39:04,211
When he stopped being
a cardiothoracic surgeon?

855
00:39:04,278 --> 00:39:06,847
Yes. You want to know
what happened?

856
00:39:06,914 --> 00:39:09,116
No. It's not yours to tell.

857
00:39:09,183 --> 00:39:10,884
No.

858
00:39:10,952 --> 00:39:13,520
You haven't asked me
about morgan.

859
00:39:13,588 --> 00:39:15,055
Oh, we don't need to--

860
00:39:15,123 --> 00:39:17,023
Yesterday you had an opinion.

861
00:39:17,091 --> 00:39:19,960
Yesterday you were ready to
have me tarred and feathered.

862
00:39:20,027 --> 00:39:22,028
* when you feel just like
a prisoner of all... *

863
00:39:22,096 --> 00:39:24,431
Tucker sent e-mails

864
00:39:24,499 --> 00:39:27,534
To a woman
in his mommy and me group.

865
00:39:27,602 --> 00:39:30,737
After he moved out,
I found them.

866
00:39:30,805 --> 00:39:34,341
He... Talked to this woman
about us,

867
00:39:34,408 --> 00:39:37,911
About life,
about what he wanted,

868
00:39:37,979 --> 00:39:41,148
Which, in the end,
wasn't me.

869
00:39:41,215 --> 00:39:43,116
Now they never
slept together,

870
00:39:43,184 --> 00:39:45,085
But he cheated on me

871
00:39:45,153 --> 00:39:48,455
The minute he sent
the first e-mail...

872
00:39:48,523 --> 00:39:49,990
* ...To get somewhere *

873
00:39:50,057 --> 00:39:52,092
(voice breaking)
shared feelings

874
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,227
With this other woman...

875
00:39:54,295 --> 00:39:57,664
Intimate feelings...

876
00:39:57,732 --> 00:40:00,901
That he did not share
with me.

877
00:40:00,968 --> 00:40:03,970
I fell in love with him.

878
00:40:04,038 --> 00:40:05,939
* and I earned these wings *

879
00:40:06,007 --> 00:40:08,441
And I keep saying that...

880
00:40:08,509 --> 00:40:10,744
I did the right thing
in the end.

881
00:40:10,812 --> 00:40:13,413
But along the way...

882
00:40:13,481 --> 00:40:15,282
I did wrong.

883
00:40:15,349 --> 00:40:17,551
(normal voice)
you did wrong.

884
00:40:17,618 --> 00:40:20,554
But, you know,
at least you're open,

885
00:40:20,621 --> 00:40:23,590
At least you try, you feel,

886
00:40:23,658 --> 00:40:27,694
You... Are alive,
you have feelings.

887
00:40:27,762 --> 00:40:31,164
(scoffs) I don't even know
how to be kissed anymore.

888
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:33,266
I'm sorry.

889
00:40:33,334 --> 00:40:36,803
I'm not the one you need
to be apologizing to.

890
00:40:36,871 --> 00:40:38,705
Mm.

891
00:40:41,676 --> 00:40:44,044
* when you lose your way *

892
00:40:44,111 --> 00:40:46,046
* when you can't escape *

893
00:40:46,113 --> 00:40:47,747
* when you feel... *

894
00:40:47,815 --> 00:40:49,249
Hey.

895
00:40:49,317 --> 00:40:53,920
* of all the world
says you will never be *

896
00:40:53,988 --> 00:40:56,022
You've done nothing wrong.

897
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:58,124
You just...

898
00:40:58,192 --> 00:40:59,759
You're you.

899
00:40:59,827 --> 00:41:02,262
I mean, you've done
nothing wrong. I'm the one.

900
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:04,531
I feel guilty,
and I look at you.

901
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:06,499
I see myself
through your eyes,

902
00:41:06,567 --> 00:41:09,870
And... It's like
you're judging me.

903
00:41:09,937 --> 00:41:11,438
I am not judging you.

904
00:41:11,505 --> 00:41:12,939
I know.

905
00:41:13,007 --> 00:41:14,774
I'm judging me...

906
00:41:14,842 --> 00:41:16,810
For who I am,
for what I've done,

907
00:41:16,878 --> 00:41:20,380
And... It's just easier
to take it out on you

908
00:41:20,448 --> 00:41:22,749
Than to take it out on me.

909
00:41:22,817 --> 00:41:24,751
* ...And the fire *

910
00:41:24,819 --> 00:41:27,287
* 'cause it taught me
how to love *

911
00:41:27,355 --> 00:41:30,891
I'm sorry.

912
00:41:30,958 --> 00:41:33,126
* and finally
I'm learning to fly *

913
00:41:33,194 --> 00:41:34,794
You want to sit down?

914
00:41:34,862 --> 00:41:37,230
Yes, please.

915
00:41:37,298 --> 00:41:40,901
* ooh, ooh, ooh *

916
00:41:40,968 --> 00:41:45,405
* and finally
I'm learning to fly *
