1
00:00:20,658 --> 00:00:23,691
For weeks, rumors have
spread across Mars...

2
00:00:23,761 --> 00:00:26,096
from outposts to settlements...

3
00:00:26,161 --> 00:00:28,169
from town to town.

4
00:00:28,242 --> 00:00:32,682
Something that had been buried for
centuries has just been uncovered.

5
00:00:32,753 --> 00:00:37,063
And as this mysterious force
moves across the southern valley...

6
00:00:37,138 --> 00:00:39,625
it leaves behind only silence...

7
00:00:39,697 --> 00:00:41,388
and death.

8
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:30,088
Take your seats, please.

9
00:02:40,335 --> 00:02:42,091
I just talked with the Cartel.

10
00:02:42,158 --> 00:02:44,069
They're concerned that the rumors
are getting out of control.

11
00:02:44,144 --> 00:02:46,892
They'd like to make a statement
in two hours.

12
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:50,091
Some of you may not know
we've had another incident.

13
00:02:50,192 --> 00:02:52,133
At 1520 hours yesterday,
a freight train...

14
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,475
Trans Marineris 74 Yankee...

15
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:57,412
returned from the southern valley
on autopilot.

16
00:02:57,518 --> 00:02:59,973
Get to your security stations now!

17
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,760
Let's move.

18
00:03:17,807 --> 00:03:20,677
Initial reports indicated
it was a ghost train.

19
00:03:20,751 --> 00:03:22,276
It appeared no one was aboard...

20
00:03:22,381 --> 00:03:25,678
until a single survivor was
discovered in the rear compartment.

21
00:03:25,774 --> 00:03:27,563
Call for a med tech backup.

22
00:03:27,631 --> 00:03:29,539
Lieutenant Melanie Ballard...

23
00:03:29,645 --> 00:03:32,612
second officer,
first squad of escort police.

24
00:03:32,686 --> 00:03:34,539
They were assigned
to transfer a prisoner...

25
00:03:34,605 --> 00:03:37,475
from the jail at Shining Canyon Mine
back here to Chryse.

26
00:03:38,734 --> 00:03:41,580
Lieutenant Ballard was taken
to hospital under guard.

27
00:03:42,286 --> 00:03:45,635
She had superficial wounds, but was
in otherwise good physical condition.

28
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:49,451
However, traces of an illegal
substance, tetramonochloride...

29
00:03:49,517 --> 00:03:51,427
were found in her system.

30
00:03:53,357 --> 00:03:54,437
Bring her in, please.

31
00:04:06,957 --> 00:04:08,868
Lieutenant Ballard,
please be seated.

32
00:04:10,029 --> 00:04:13,324
Do I get a lawyer, or don't police
officers have rights these days?

33
00:04:13,388 --> 00:04:16,616
Representation by counsel
won't be necessary.

34
00:04:16,684 --> 00:04:19,467
Your rights are protected
by the Matronage.

35
00:04:19,533 --> 00:04:21,094
You can speak freely.

36
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,718
- Then I'm not being charged?
- Sit down, Lieutenant.

37
00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:25,218
This is a discovery hearing...

38
00:04:25,293 --> 00:04:28,358
and your presence is required
as ranking officer.

39
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,532
I want your after-action report.

40
00:04:30,636 --> 00:04:33,801
Where's the rest of your team,
the prisoner you picked up?

41
00:04:33,868 --> 00:04:36,169
What happened at Shining Canyon?

42
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:41,894
Last Friday at 1750, we were
slamming through a dust storm...

43
00:04:41,964 --> 00:04:44,202
on the edge of the southern valley.

44
00:04:45,517 --> 00:04:47,272
74 Yankee was an ore hauler...

45
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,510
servicing the mines
in the outer sector.

46
00:04:50,765 --> 00:04:54,212
My squad was hitching a ride
into Shining Canyon.

47
00:04:54,284 --> 00:04:55,844
You beat me.

48
00:04:56,492 --> 00:04:59,338
- Looks like you played tarts before.
- No, I've never done this.

49
00:05:00,204 --> 00:05:02,593
Let's spin 'em again.
One down and one up.

50
00:05:07,596 --> 00:05:09,255
Fuck me! The five of bats.

51
00:05:09,324 --> 00:05:11,812
You got the wheel up.
What's your wager?

52
00:05:11,885 --> 00:05:13,891
Five bucks.

53
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,376
Helena? Hey.

54
00:05:22,445 --> 00:05:24,134
Sorry.

55
00:05:24,202 --> 00:05:26,822
Weather station's tracking a huge
storm across the southern sector...

56
00:05:26,892 --> 00:05:28,834
and we're right under it by now.

57
00:05:32,011 --> 00:05:34,345
- What's the mark on it?
- 3,200 kliks.

58
00:05:34,411 --> 00:05:36,516
We should be there by 1800.

59
00:05:42,186 --> 00:05:44,360
Just let me know
if you need anything.

60
00:06:34,154 --> 00:06:35,648
You high?

61
00:06:36,843 --> 00:06:38,697
Fuck, Helena, it's just clear.

62
00:06:38,762 --> 00:06:41,577
I'll be straighter than this track
long before we hit the canyon.

63
00:06:41,675 --> 00:06:45,057
You better be. This prisoner
transfer is no sleepwalk.

64
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:48,611
- We're picking up James Williams.
- You mean "Desolation" Williams?

65
00:06:48,683 --> 00:06:51,201
Cooling his heels
in the Shining Canyon jail.

66
00:06:51,273 --> 00:06:53,249
Deep solitary.

67
00:06:53,321 --> 00:06:56,900
- What's the charge this time?
- Murder.

68
00:06:57,482 --> 00:07:00,516
The man's been up on murder three times.
He gets off every time on self-defense.

69
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:03,401
It's different this time.
Sounds like he finally went psycho.

70
00:07:03,466 --> 00:07:06,499
Beaucoup corpses, all mutilated.

71
00:07:06,602 --> 00:07:09,830
Williams shows up at the mine
with some bizarre-ass story.

72
00:07:09,898 --> 00:07:13,672
Sends three officers to the medevac
before they locked him down.

73
00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:17,085
- You starting to see the picture?
- And all we got is you, me...

74
00:07:17,161 --> 00:07:19,202
and this new guy Jericho
and a couple of rookies?

75
00:07:19,274 --> 00:07:21,477
What do you think
of Sergeant Jericho?

76
00:07:21,545 --> 00:07:24,806
I was hoping we'd get a good,
solid woman we could count on.

77
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:27,143
I don't know.
I guess we'll see.

78
00:07:28,265 --> 00:07:30,851
Well...

79
00:07:30,923 --> 00:07:34,117
I need you straight, Melanie.

80
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:38,081
Don't worry about that,
Commander.

81
00:07:38,185 --> 00:07:40,159
I'm as straight as they come.

82
00:07:40,264 --> 00:07:42,152
Such a shame.

83
00:07:45,481 --> 00:07:47,172
Check on
our transfer schedule.

84
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:50,561
Shining Canyon.

85
00:07:50,632 --> 00:07:54,660
Shining Canyon,
this is Trans Marineris 74 Yankee.

86
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:55,973
They ready for us?

87
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:58,758
This storm's really kicking up a mess.
I can't get through to the tower.

88
00:07:58,825 --> 00:08:00,767
Here's your coffee, Mr. McSimms.
Three sugars and two whites.

89
00:08:00,841 --> 00:08:03,230
Just the way you like it.
You want some?

90
00:08:03,305 --> 00:08:05,640
No, thanks.
How long?

91
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,862
About 40.

92
00:08:08,936 --> 00:08:10,724
Shining Canyon.

93
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,311
Shining Canyon, this is
Trans Marineris 74 Yankee.

94
00:08:13,417 --> 00:08:15,391
ETA, 40 minutes.

95
00:08:16,585 --> 00:08:19,618
Everybody check your equipment.
I don't want any surprises.

96
00:08:21,928 --> 00:08:24,829
Is everything all right,
Lieutenant?

97
00:08:24,903 --> 00:08:28,035
I couldn't help but notice that charming
little scene with the queen bee.

98
00:08:28,104 --> 00:08:30,591
Yeah, well, you know how
the service is, Sergeant.

99
00:08:30,663 --> 00:08:33,925
She figures if I want to make captain,
I'll have to pay the price.

100
00:08:33,993 --> 00:08:36,742
Thing is, I don't give a damn
about wearing another bar.

101
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:38,597
It could be that.

102
00:08:38,663 --> 00:08:41,730
Or maybe she just has
good taste in women.

103
00:08:41,832 --> 00:08:44,645
Sergeant, you are
seriously out of line.

104
00:08:44,711 --> 00:08:46,654
I'd hate to spoil my record.

105
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:51,015
All right. I know you think
you're some pretty tough hombres.

106
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,487
You've had the best training.
You have the best gear.

107
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,374
You probably think this is
some routine prisoner transfer.

108
00:08:58,439 --> 00:09:00,164
But that's what I want
to bang into your heads.

109
00:09:00,232 --> 00:09:02,336
There's nothing routine
about this prisoner.

110
00:09:02,406 --> 00:09:05,724
We are here to pick up
James "Desolation" Williams.

111
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:08,483
I want you all jack-ready
and double tough.

112
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,732
Officers, you can disembark here.

113
00:09:33,478 --> 00:09:34,405
What time is departure?

114
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,576
We need at least half an hour
to secure our prisoner.

115
00:09:36,647 --> 00:09:38,175
We got about
a four-hour turnaround...

116
00:09:38,247 --> 00:09:41,509
and we'll be back
at this spot at about 2200.

117
00:09:41,575 --> 00:09:43,396
You can re-board any time after that.

118
00:09:43,462 --> 00:09:45,699
See if you can raise
the yard master, will ya?

119
00:09:45,798 --> 00:09:49,693
Ed? Ed, you out there?

120
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:51,324
Rookies, use your breathers.

121
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:54,911
We're not gonna have air like Earth
for ten more years. Let's go.

122
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:21,212
- God, I hate this thing.
- You'll get used to it.

123
00:10:21,317 --> 00:10:24,416
Two years ago, we were still
wearing full-face breathers.

124
00:10:24,486 --> 00:10:26,525
It takes about a month to get over
the headaches out here.

125
00:10:28,326 --> 00:10:32,254
So this is Shining Canyon?
God, what a dump.

126
00:10:32,326 --> 00:10:35,196
- First time in the boonies, rookie?
- Standard layout.

127
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,473
Just another shitty boomtown
like all the others.

128
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,199
Seen one, you can go home.

129
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:41,157
You're always cold,
you can't get a decent shower...

130
00:10:41,222 --> 00:10:43,937
and they don't tell you
that a one-year contract here...

131
00:10:44,005 --> 00:10:46,274
equals two years' Earth time.

132
00:10:46,341 --> 00:10:48,197
You gotta read the fine print.

133
00:10:54,693 --> 00:10:56,067
Where is everybody?

134
00:10:57,093 --> 00:10:59,940
Yeah. Friday night,
the place should be packed.

135
00:11:00,005 --> 00:11:02,874
A whole 12 hours before sun up,
and there's money to burn...

136
00:11:02,948 --> 00:11:06,265
whores to fuck
and drugs to take.

137
00:11:06,341 --> 00:11:08,316
Instead, we got a graveyard.

138
00:11:10,214 --> 00:11:13,180
Maybe they're all inside,
spending their money.

139
00:11:13,252 --> 00:11:14,878
Mel, I'll get us squared away
at the rec-fac.

140
00:11:14,948 --> 00:11:17,404
You and Sergeant Jericho
check in at the jail.

141
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,733
Save some hot water for me.

142
00:11:23,813 --> 00:11:25,916
Where were you before Chryse?

143
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,355
Utopia.

144
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,689
It's the arse end of the universe.

145
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:33,986
A penal camp full of
work-amnesty cutthroats.

146
00:11:34,052 --> 00:11:35,712
Sounds nasty...

147
00:11:35,781 --> 00:11:38,432
but you seem to be
holding together all right.

148
00:11:38,501 --> 00:11:40,868
What you see is nothing.

149
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:43,354
I have numerous
hidden talents.

150
00:11:59,173 --> 00:12:00,601
Need some help with that?

151
00:12:01,251 --> 00:12:03,935
You're persistent, aren't you?

152
00:12:04,004 --> 00:12:06,556
I've changed a few minds
in my time.

153
00:12:06,627 --> 00:12:09,695
There's not many
of us breeders around.

154
00:12:09,765 --> 00:12:12,797
I'd hate to miss a chance
to give it a go.

155
00:12:12,868 --> 00:12:14,590
What do you say?

156
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,666
Hello!

157
00:12:25,507 --> 00:12:27,329
Anybody here?

158
00:12:43,235 --> 00:12:45,243
Officer to front desk.

159
00:12:55,364 --> 00:12:58,014
Well, hello, Mr. Williams.

160
00:13:02,403 --> 00:13:04,574
No one seems to be about.
What do you make of it?

161
00:13:04,643 --> 00:13:05,657
I don't know.

162
00:13:05,764 --> 00:13:07,966
Do you want me to pop the lock
and ask the prisoners?

163
00:13:08,034 --> 00:13:10,685
What do you mean, pop the lock?
That's a level-eight security door.

164
00:13:11,748 --> 00:13:14,976
I've got a mystical way with
locks and mechanical objects.

165
00:13:15,043 --> 00:13:17,148
There isn't a machine on Mars
that doesn't love me.

166
00:13:18,114 --> 00:13:20,667
How about we check with
the commander first?

167
00:13:24,225 --> 00:13:27,871
So what do you do for fun then?
Are you a gambler?

168
00:13:27,939 --> 00:13:32,346
No. I'm short-time, Sergeant.
I believe in saving my money.

169
00:13:33,763 --> 00:13:37,243
Don't worry about that.
I was gonna do it for free.

170
00:13:38,498 --> 00:13:40,539
Let me put it this way.

171
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,880
Maybe I'd sleep with you
if you were the last man on Earth.

172
00:13:44,514 --> 00:13:46,457
But we're not on Earth.

173
00:13:50,049 --> 00:13:52,603
It's a voltage overload,
most likely.

174
00:13:53,315 --> 00:13:55,453
You want to check it out?

175
00:13:55,522 --> 00:13:57,082
It's probably nothing.

176
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,059
But on second thought--

177
00:14:42,752 --> 00:14:45,120
Police officer.
Anybody there?

178
00:15:11,135 --> 00:15:12,892
Shit!

179
00:15:29,247 --> 00:15:31,965
- This is not making me happy.
- It's time to get backup.

180
00:16:02,975 --> 00:16:06,041
Jesus Christ.
What are you doing?

181
00:16:07,326 --> 00:16:10,806
- I almost killed you.
- What's going on?

182
00:16:10,909 --> 00:16:14,391
- Rec-fac's a slaughterhouse.
- What?

183
00:16:14,495 --> 00:16:15,923
Slaughterhouse?

184
00:16:16,926 --> 00:16:21,434
That's the word Descanso used.
I didn't see it myself.

185
00:16:21,505 --> 00:16:23,161
According to what
Commander Braddock told me...

186
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,685
right after we first arrived
in Shining Canyon...

187
00:16:25,758 --> 00:16:29,555
she and the two rookies headed
towards the recreation facility.

188
00:16:29,631 --> 00:16:31,518
Mel, I'll get us squared away
at the rec-fac.

189
00:16:31,582 --> 00:16:34,168
You and Sergeant Jericho
go and check in at the jail.

190
00:16:34,238 --> 00:16:36,094
Save some hot water for me.

191
00:16:58,909 --> 00:17:01,724
Descanso, sweep left.

192
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:04,412
Bashira, stick with me.

193
00:17:20,221 --> 00:17:22,043
Officer to train,
do you read?

194
00:17:22,622 --> 00:17:26,200
The casino, barracks, dining hall,
rec center, no one alive anywhere.

195
00:17:28,828 --> 00:17:31,350
- Commander.
- What?

196
00:17:32,735 --> 00:17:36,476
- I can't reach the train.
- Well, keep trying.

197
00:17:40,348 --> 00:17:41,397
How are we doing?

198
00:17:42,685 --> 00:17:44,474
I don't know. This thing
was built to stay locked.

199
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:46,515
And Williams
is still locked up?

200
00:17:47,868 --> 00:17:48,796
What do you mean?

201
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:51,513
Williams was arrested
on the suspicion of murdering...

202
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:55,258
six rail workers and a payroll courier
up at Klik 305 Hub Station.

203
00:17:55,326 --> 00:17:59,417
The bodies were hung and decapitated,
just like the bodies in the rec-fac.

204
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,487
So how'd they pin that
on Desolation?

205
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:04,182
He showed up here
with the courier's payroll.

206
00:18:04,252 --> 00:18:06,228
The cashier realized
it was a stolen scrip.

207
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:08,210
They made the arrest.

208
00:18:08,285 --> 00:18:10,870
There's got to be a day log
here somewhere.

209
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,466
Sergeant's desk.

210
00:18:22,461 --> 00:18:24,119
Here.

211
00:18:26,845 --> 00:18:29,877
Last night the mine called in
a work stoppage.

212
00:18:29,947 --> 00:18:32,337
Reported winds
gusting up to 60 knots.

213
00:18:32,413 --> 00:18:34,354
- Sixty?
- That's what it says.

214
00:18:35,004 --> 00:18:36,412
Anything else?

215
00:18:36,476 --> 00:18:39,291
Arrest for theft, then nothing.

216
00:18:41,563 --> 00:18:43,190
Got it.

217
00:19:07,899 --> 00:19:09,109
What's going on around here?

218
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:12,792
We haven't had a meal
or a piss break in six hours.

219
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,095
Descanso, open the door.

220
00:19:15,163 --> 00:19:17,367
All right, everybody, answer "here"
when I call your name.

221
00:19:17,436 --> 00:19:18,996
- Akooshay.
- What?

222
00:19:19,067 --> 00:19:20,594
Just answer "here."

223
00:19:20,669 --> 00:19:22,326
- Yeah.
- Zimmerman.

224
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:24,283
I'm right in front of you.

225
00:19:24,348 --> 00:19:25,591
Benchley.

226
00:19:27,324 --> 00:19:30,519
- Who's that?
- She showed up last night.

227
00:19:31,451 --> 00:19:34,866
Checked herself in. Insisted on
being locked up here with us.

228
00:19:34,938 --> 00:19:36,827
Well, wake her up, sunshine.

229
00:19:36,891 --> 00:19:38,898
Let's see what she has to say.

230
00:19:42,011 --> 00:19:44,083
Somebody wants to talk to you.

231
00:19:45,115 --> 00:19:47,832
- Who are you?
- Whitlock.

232
00:19:47,899 --> 00:19:50,420
What are you doing
in the holding tank, Whitlock?

233
00:19:51,898 --> 00:19:54,387
It's the only safe place
at the moment, okay?

234
00:19:54,491 --> 00:19:56,596
- Can I go back to sleep now?
- No, you can't!

235
00:19:56,699 --> 00:19:59,829
I need answers.
What's going on out there?

236
00:20:03,034 --> 00:20:04,409
What's your I.D.?

237
00:20:06,684 --> 00:20:10,031
Dr. Arlene Whitlock.
I'm the Spec Six science officer...

238
00:20:10,106 --> 00:20:13,784
in charge of the mining operation
at Drucker's Ridge.

239
00:20:14,459 --> 00:20:18,900
I left Drucker's about a week ago
with a weather balloon I'd modified.

240
00:20:18,971 --> 00:20:24,152
There was a disturbance in town.
It seemed prudent to get out.

241
00:20:24,219 --> 00:20:27,064
They said there was a riot
and the place was destroyed.

242
00:20:27,129 --> 00:20:28,984
Yeah, something like that.

243
00:20:29,049 --> 00:20:32,084
I was adrift for several days,
you know.

244
00:20:32,155 --> 00:20:33,910
Ran out of food.

245
00:20:33,978 --> 00:20:37,274
I followed the railroad tracks
until I got here.

246
00:20:37,338 --> 00:20:39,093
Oh, shit.

247
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,267
Then the storm forced me too low.

248
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:45,012
I hit a windmill and crashed.

249
00:20:57,657 --> 00:21:00,024
And they were kind enough
to take me in here.

250
00:21:00,089 --> 00:21:01,945
Well, wasn't that nice of them.

251
00:21:02,778 --> 00:21:06,552
Mel, Jericho,
go check out Williams.

252
00:21:06,649 --> 00:21:08,275
See if he knows anything
about this.

253
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:18,582
Williams, do you know
what's going on outside?

254
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:25,751
Are you aware of
what's going on outside?

255
00:21:27,513 --> 00:21:31,310
Let's go. This asshole
doesn't know anything either.

256
00:21:44,953 --> 00:21:46,894
You got some balls, calling him
an asshole to his face.

257
00:21:46,968 --> 00:21:48,824
That's Desolation Williams.

258
00:21:48,889 --> 00:21:52,020
I heard he took out at least six when
they cornered him at Deimos Station.

259
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,406
And this is eight inches.
You men love to exaggerate.

260
00:21:56,472 --> 00:21:57,879
Just goes with the territory.

261
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:01,775
Yeah, well, in my case,
it's a bit different.

262
00:22:01,881 --> 00:22:05,142
Perhaps a connoisseur like yourself
would appreciate what I have to offer.

263
00:22:30,647 --> 00:22:32,502
Go get the commander.

264
00:23:04,376 --> 00:23:06,230
Disarm her.

265
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,992
Officer.

266
00:23:21,431 --> 00:23:24,212
It was almost like she was...

267
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:26,667
possessed.

268
00:23:26,742 --> 00:23:29,012
Like there was some kind
of force inside her.

269
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:32,908
- Who was she?
- She was a dispatch officer.

270
00:23:32,983 --> 00:23:35,797
We tried to make her comfortable.

271
00:23:35,862 --> 00:23:39,278
The rookies took her to a storage
room in the back of the jail.

272
00:23:39,382 --> 00:23:42,798
Then the commander and I went
back outside to look around town.

273
00:23:44,213 --> 00:23:48,338
- What do you think?
- That the science officer is lying.

274
00:23:48,405 --> 00:23:51,984
- Tell me again about Williams.
- I didn't read the full file.

275
00:23:52,054 --> 00:23:54,030
Caught him with the money,
but he said he didn't kill anybody.

276
00:23:54,104 --> 00:23:58,411
- Course. They all died off right.
- Then cut their own heads off?

277
00:24:23,765 --> 00:24:26,220
Put down your weapon!
Put it down!

278
00:24:27,861 --> 00:24:29,651
Call Jericho.

279
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,474
Sergeant Jericho,
we need backup!

280
00:24:31,542 --> 00:24:33,451
We're 20 southwest
of the rec-fac.

281
00:24:33,525 --> 00:24:35,762
Don't open the door!
Don't let it out!

282
00:24:46,198 --> 00:24:47,888
Who goes there?

283
00:24:53,046 --> 00:24:55,150
I can't fight it!
It's in me!

284
00:25:01,589 --> 00:25:03,344
Commander Braddock!

285
00:25:18,069 --> 00:25:19,922
There's a man in there.
Open it.

286
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:25,199
The lock is destroyed.
I gonna need a cutting torch.

287
00:25:25,268 --> 00:25:26,893
How long?

288
00:25:26,964 --> 00:25:29,005
At least half an hour,
maybe more.

289
00:25:30,387 --> 00:25:32,013
What the fuck
is going on here?

290
00:25:32,084 --> 00:25:34,091
He committed suicide.

291
00:25:34,164 --> 00:25:35,920
Before he slit his throat,
he yelled something...

292
00:25:35,988 --> 00:25:38,322
something like, "Stay away!

293
00:25:39,155 --> 00:25:43,050
Don't open the door.
Stay away."

294
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,410
And now
the commander's gone.

295
00:25:58,164 --> 00:26:00,105
Maybe he was contagious.

296
00:26:01,395 --> 00:26:04,265
Or crazy.
I don't know.

297
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,379
I say we take him at his word
and leave him locked in.

298
00:26:09,523 --> 00:26:13,135
Look, one of us has
to stay with the rookies.

299
00:26:13,204 --> 00:26:16,881
Why don't you go back to the jail?
I'll find the commander.

300
00:26:16,948 --> 00:26:19,565
Let's get the hell
out of this place.

301
00:26:19,668 --> 00:26:21,709
There's nothing we can do
for this guy.

302
00:26:23,507 --> 00:26:25,362
You're right.

303
00:26:25,427 --> 00:26:27,315
Okay, let's go.

304
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:44,555
Drop the weapon before
I cut this dyke bitch head off!.

305
00:26:44,627 --> 00:26:46,221
What the fuck happened?

306
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:48,013
Bashira let him out
for some food.

307
00:26:48,081 --> 00:26:49,773
Let me guess.
You unshackled him.

308
00:26:52,467 --> 00:26:55,500
- What do you want, Williams?
- I wanna get the fuck out of here.

309
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,193
We'll let you walk.
Just let the girl go.

310
00:27:01,266 --> 00:27:04,081
You think I'm falling for that shit?

311
00:27:04,147 --> 00:27:06,219
I can't let you take the rookie.

312
00:27:08,242 --> 00:27:11,373
Take me, okay?

313
00:27:16,882 --> 00:27:20,078
Put the gun down.
Put 'em down!

314
00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:25,455
Drop your gun, Descanso.

315
00:27:25,554 --> 00:27:27,442
Yeah, drop the gun, Descanso.

316
00:27:39,218 --> 00:27:42,315
Relax! Take it easy!

317
00:27:42,385 --> 00:27:44,556
Just relax, relax.

318
00:27:45,618 --> 00:27:48,880
- You'll get what you want.
- I know I'll get everything I want.

319
00:27:48,946 --> 00:27:50,319
Now let's go.

320
00:27:53,682 --> 00:27:56,813
Damn girl,
I like you already.

321
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,736
Shit.

322
00:28:07,248 --> 00:28:08,394
You okay?

323
00:28:10,514 --> 00:28:12,400
Just swell.

324
00:28:13,648 --> 00:28:16,814
- Where's Williams?
- He took off out the air lock.

325
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,762
He went into the clinic.

326
00:28:22,833 --> 00:28:24,490
I saw him go in
not even two minutes ago.

327
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,219
Let me guess.
He's got your shotgun, right?

328
00:28:26,321 --> 00:28:27,695
Couldn't help it.
He was too fast.

329
00:28:27,761 --> 00:28:29,549
He's still in there though.
I can see the back door from here.

330
00:28:29,617 --> 00:28:31,822
All right,
you two take the back door.

331
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:35,630
I'll go in front and flush him out.
If he comes at you, shoot to kill.

332
00:30:16,623 --> 00:30:17,768
Now what?

333
00:30:27,695 --> 00:30:30,149
How the hell did that happen?

334
00:30:30,222 --> 00:30:32,776
- Let's go.
- Wait a minute.

335
00:30:33,455 --> 00:30:35,113
Looks like you're
coming with me now.

336
00:30:35,214 --> 00:30:38,859
You see what's going on out there.
You know I didn't kill nobody.

337
00:30:38,927 --> 00:30:42,538
- I said move it.
- I ain't going nowhere.

338
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:45,127
I just saved your life.
You should let me go.

339
00:30:45,197 --> 00:30:47,619
And I saved yours.
Looks like we're even.

340
00:30:48,367 --> 00:30:50,822
Now move it!

341
00:31:18,479 --> 00:31:20,333
Let me ask you something.

342
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:23,976
If you're so innocent, how come we
found all that stolen flash on you?

343
00:31:25,069 --> 00:31:27,458
I didn't say I was innocent.

344
00:31:27,533 --> 00:31:29,508
I said I didn't kill nobody.

345
00:31:30,606 --> 00:31:33,095
Okay, let's say I believe you.

346
00:31:33,165 --> 00:31:35,718
What exactly happened
at K-305?

347
00:31:35,789 --> 00:31:37,612
I don't know.

348
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:40,392
I was just changing trains
from Camp Sinai.

349
00:31:41,709 --> 00:31:44,709
Had a little time
to get me something to eat...

350
00:31:44,781 --> 00:31:46,885
so I went into the station.

351
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,441
It was just lying there,
so you took it.

352
00:32:26,508 --> 00:32:28,548
You would have done
the same thing.

353
00:32:31,724 --> 00:32:34,789
See, that's where you're wrong.

354
00:32:34,859 --> 00:32:37,708
I'm a cop, not a crook.

355
00:32:37,772 --> 00:32:42,529
It's a thin line between
a cop and a crook these days.

356
00:32:42,604 --> 00:32:44,580
You think it's a big difference
between you and me?

357
00:32:44,685 --> 00:32:47,553
You just got the woman
behind your bullshit.

358
00:32:48,491 --> 00:32:51,938
Look at you.
You look high right now.

359
00:32:55,435 --> 00:32:58,217
You know
I saved your life out there.

360
00:32:58,283 --> 00:33:01,447
So why don't you save mine
and let me out of here?

361
00:33:03,531 --> 00:33:04,905
Look...

362
00:33:06,474 --> 00:33:09,061
my job is to bring you back
to Chryse to stand trial.

363
00:33:10,028 --> 00:33:12,068
I don't think you did it.

364
00:33:12,139 --> 00:33:14,082
But that's not my call.

365
00:33:15,211 --> 00:33:17,578
So let's not make this any more
complicated than it has to be.

366
00:33:20,044 --> 00:33:22,312
Yeah, it's gonna be
real complicated.

367
00:33:22,379 --> 00:33:24,102
You can believe that shit!

368
00:33:26,219 --> 00:33:28,641
I ain't going back!

369
00:33:29,292 --> 00:33:32,041
Soyou secured your prisoner.

370
00:33:32,108 --> 00:33:34,409
Where was your commanding
officer during this time?

371
00:33:34,475 --> 00:33:38,120
I can only report what
Sergeant Jericho told me later.

372
00:33:38,187 --> 00:33:39,876
After the man in the Rover
committed suicide...

373
00:33:39,946 --> 00:33:42,152
Jericho went looking
for the commander.

374
00:33:42,219 --> 00:33:44,194
Let's get the hell
out of this place.

375
00:33:44,267 --> 00:33:47,494
There's nothing we can do
for this guy.

376
00:33:47,594 --> 00:33:51,206
Yeah, you're right.
Let's go.

377
00:33:58,505 --> 00:34:00,360
Commander Braddock!

378
00:36:22,376 --> 00:36:25,374
Lieutenant,
we got a situation here.

379
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,966
Sergeant, you're breaking up.
I can hardly hear you.

380
00:36:29,736 --> 00:36:31,045
The commander's dead.

381
00:36:32,808 --> 00:36:34,979
Everybody in the mine
has gone insane.

382
00:36:37,702 --> 00:36:39,590
Jericho, can you read?

383
00:36:47,527 --> 00:36:49,316
Hey, come on!
Let us out of here!

384
00:36:49,383 --> 00:36:51,292
Start at the beginning!

385
00:36:53,512 --> 00:36:55,878
- I told you. I got here last night.
- Don't bullshit me!

386
00:36:55,942 --> 00:36:57,469
Lieutenant!

387
00:37:02,439 --> 00:37:04,774
What the hell is going on
out there?

388
00:37:08,038 --> 00:37:09,500
What?

389
00:37:11,367 --> 00:37:14,681
In semiarid regions on Earth,
there are certain organisms...

390
00:37:14,757 --> 00:37:17,660
that live in small pools
that are formed by the annual rains.

391
00:37:17,734 --> 00:37:20,222
When the pools dry up,
those organisms can't live.

392
00:37:20,296 --> 00:37:24,767
But they don't die either.
They go dormant below the surface...

393
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:29,116
away from the hot sun
until the next rain cycle begins.

394
00:37:29,223 --> 00:37:31,360
Then they reemerge.

395
00:37:31,462 --> 00:37:33,152
I think something like that
is happening here.

396
00:37:33,253 --> 00:37:35,043
I don't understand.

397
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:37,892
Whatever used to live here,
we woke it up.

398
00:37:37,958 --> 00:37:40,259
It takes us, okay?

399
00:37:40,326 --> 00:37:43,008
I'm talking about
a kind of possession.

400
00:37:43,077 --> 00:37:45,381
Lieutenant, Sergeant Jericho
is on the radio.

401
00:37:45,447 --> 00:37:47,389
He said he found
three people out there.

402
00:37:47,463 --> 00:37:50,332
They're on their way in and
they got an ETA of five minutes.

403
00:37:50,407 --> 00:37:52,348
You should get on the radio
and talk to him.

404
00:37:52,422 --> 00:37:55,619
- He's found three people?
- That's what he said.

405
00:38:11,494 --> 00:38:13,566
- You okay?
- No.

406
00:38:13,636 --> 00:38:15,524
Something broken?

407
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:20,708
I'm all right.

408
00:38:20,773 --> 00:38:23,043
But it's out of the body now.

409
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:25,345
Yeah, it's loose in here.

410
00:38:27,878 --> 00:38:29,852
Lieutenant,
sergeant's on the radio.

411
00:38:45,734 --> 00:38:48,733
Lieutenant, we're coming in.
Can you read me?

412
00:38:48,805 --> 00:38:52,580
- Sergeant, where are you?
- We're right down the street.

413
00:38:52,645 --> 00:38:54,532
We? Who's we?

414
00:38:54,596 --> 00:38:57,979
I found three people alive out here.
Come on. Open the door for us.

415
00:39:12,771 --> 00:39:17,311
I tried to reach you on the radio.
Just you make sure that door is locked.

416
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,941
There must be
200 of them fucking freaks...

417
00:39:19,012 --> 00:39:22,242
and any minute now
they'll be coming to kick our ass.

418
00:39:22,309 --> 00:39:26,716
Okay, relax.
Who are these guys?

419
00:39:26,788 --> 00:39:29,342
I found them hiding
up in the mine shed.

420
00:39:36,196 --> 00:39:39,904
Lieutenant,
we got a situation here.

421
00:39:40,004 --> 00:39:42,369
Sergeant, you're breaking up.
I can hardly hear you.

422
00:39:43,587 --> 00:39:45,758
The commander's dead.

423
00:39:46,852 --> 00:39:49,721
And everybody in the mine
has gone insane.

424
00:40:07,746 --> 00:40:09,602
Check the window!

425
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:21,561
They didn't see him.
They're gone.

426
00:40:21,634 --> 00:40:25,180
- Who are you?
- Who are we? Who are you?

427
00:40:25,251 --> 00:40:29,374
- The man asked you a question.
- My name's Jericho.

428
00:40:29,442 --> 00:40:31,745
At least he's not one of them.

429
00:40:32,996 --> 00:40:37,250
What's happening out there?
Who the fuck are those clowns?

430
00:40:37,314 --> 00:40:39,137
What are they
all sparked up about?

431
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:41,092
Used to be miners.

432
00:40:41,186 --> 00:40:43,486
Then everybody
in this place lost their mind.

433
00:40:43,554 --> 00:40:46,043
Running around,
chopping people's heads off.

434
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:49,217
Ease up, man.

435
00:40:55,331 --> 00:40:58,113
We were up on the rim
when they called a work stoppage.

436
00:41:03,075 --> 00:41:05,856
- What are they doing?
- Shit, I don't know.

437
00:41:06,465 --> 00:41:09,433
Look at that. They're
knocking off early for the night.

438
00:41:09,506 --> 00:41:12,256
How will we sneak in on a shift change
if they knock off early for the night?

439
00:41:12,322 --> 00:41:14,972
Shut up!
What the hell is that?

440
00:41:20,194 --> 00:41:22,082
Let's get the hell out of here!

441
00:41:24,418 --> 00:41:26,971
We hid till the storm was over.

442
00:41:27,042 --> 00:41:30,173
Later, I went out
to take a look around.

443
00:41:30,242 --> 00:41:33,438
I thought they were all dead.

444
00:41:33,506 --> 00:41:36,920
Then some of them
started to come to.

445
00:41:36,993 --> 00:41:42,524
They walked around
like they were confused or lost.

446
00:41:42,593 --> 00:41:45,015
A few of them seemed okay.

447
00:41:45,091 --> 00:41:46,650
They was trying
to help the others.

448
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:50,877
- Then they started changing.
- What do you mean?

449
00:41:51,937 --> 00:41:54,784
They act different,
stand different.

450
00:41:54,881 --> 00:41:58,078
Start cutting on themselves
for decoration.

451
00:41:58,145 --> 00:41:59,518
Filing their teeth.

452
00:42:00,737 --> 00:42:02,559
Making weapons.

453
00:42:04,673 --> 00:42:07,039
Killing the ones
who hadn't changed.

454
00:42:11,105 --> 00:42:15,807
Cutting people's faces off
and wearing them for masks.

455
00:42:24,224 --> 00:42:26,265
You lads got any weapons?

456
00:42:27,713 --> 00:42:29,467
I mean real weapons.

457
00:42:29,536 --> 00:42:32,188
Only cops can have guns.

458
00:42:32,257 --> 00:42:34,395
There's some detonators
in them cases over there.

459
00:42:37,088 --> 00:42:39,358
Do you know
how these things work?

460
00:42:39,424 --> 00:42:41,977
I know you need dynamite
to use them.

461
00:42:42,048 --> 00:42:44,054
Okay, then.

462
00:42:44,127 --> 00:42:45,983
We take our prisoner
and we all get on the train.

463
00:42:46,048 --> 00:42:48,219
And what prisoner would that be?

464
00:42:48,288 --> 00:42:50,176
That doesn't concern you.

465
00:42:50,273 --> 00:42:52,028
If it's Desolation Williams...

466
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:55,062
it concerns me very much.

467
00:42:55,169 --> 00:42:56,695
Now drop your weapon.

468
00:43:02,753 --> 00:43:05,980
All of you!
Weapons on the floor.

469
00:43:14,528 --> 00:43:18,303
So only cops have guns, eh?
You fucking pricks.

470
00:43:18,368 --> 00:43:21,663
We lied.
Now go get Williams.

471
00:43:23,104 --> 00:43:24,958
I don't think so.

472
00:43:26,496 --> 00:43:28,765
What was that?

473
00:43:28,831 --> 00:43:31,547
- Fucking kill me.
- No problem.

474
00:43:31,614 --> 00:43:34,648
Look, will you two
stop fucking about?

475
00:43:38,528 --> 00:43:40,894
Lieutenant, let Williams out.

476
00:43:40,958 --> 00:43:42,387
Give me one good reason.

477
00:43:43,103 --> 00:43:45,340
I just gave you
about 200 good reasons...

478
00:43:45,407 --> 00:43:47,577
and they're probably outside
right now.

479
00:43:47,646 --> 00:43:49,502
It doesn't matter that Williams
is wanted for murder...

480
00:43:49,567 --> 00:43:52,087
and it doesn't matter
that this lot are scumbags.

481
00:43:52,158 --> 00:43:56,218
What matters right now is that
we stick together to get out of here.

482
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:57,496
All of us...

483
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:01,559
including Williams,
including them.

484
00:44:02,335 --> 00:44:05,912
Who are you calling scumbag,
motherfucker?

485
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:10,485
Now quit with all your fucking
stalling and take us to Williams!

486
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:15,926
I'll be goddamn.

487
00:44:18,397 --> 00:44:19,511
Finally.

488
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:22,517
Man, this town done went crazy.

489
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:25,142
We had to improvise.
You like it?

490
00:44:25,247 --> 00:44:26,653
I love it.

491
00:44:26,718 --> 00:44:28,573
I want you to let him out.

492
00:44:34,814 --> 00:44:37,050
What's up, D?

493
00:44:39,166 --> 00:44:40,823
I'm still shackled.

494
00:44:40,893 --> 00:44:43,349
What, are you pigs on a fucking break?
Free him up.

495
00:44:47,902 --> 00:44:50,553
I knew you'd let me go.

496
00:44:53,725 --> 00:44:57,140
- It's been a long time.
- I didn't think y'all could do it.

497
00:44:57,245 --> 00:44:58,653
Piece of cake.

498
00:44:58,748 --> 00:45:00,921
It was my plan, Desolation.

499
00:45:02,461 --> 00:45:03,868
Fuck!

500
00:45:03,965 --> 00:45:06,421
- I thought you was watching the door.
- I was!

501
00:45:06,493 --> 00:45:09,208
- Bitch, you better open this door.
- I don't think so.

502
00:45:09,275 --> 00:45:12,855
You don't open that door,
I'm gonna blow your head off.

503
00:45:12,925 --> 00:45:15,510
Then your asses will never get out.

504
00:45:15,581 --> 00:45:17,075
Someone will find you sometime...

505
00:45:17,149 --> 00:45:20,052
probably tied upside down in here
with your heads cut off.

506
00:45:21,117 --> 00:45:23,507
Tell your dogs to quit barking
so we can talk.

507
00:45:26,462 --> 00:45:28,468
Put 'em down.

508
00:45:30,748 --> 00:45:32,603
Put it down.

509
00:45:34,236 --> 00:45:36,506
Listen to me, Williams.

510
00:45:36,573 --> 00:45:38,875
We don't have a lot of time.

511
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:42,006
You need us and we need you.

512
00:45:42,076 --> 00:45:43,735
We've all seen
what's going on out there...

513
00:45:43,805 --> 00:45:46,554
and none of us is gonna survive
if we don't stick together.

514
00:45:46,621 --> 00:45:48,988
I need you to give me
your word...

515
00:45:49,052 --> 00:45:50,874
that if I open this door...

516
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:54,289
you and your boys will stand by
my command at all times.

517
00:45:56,157 --> 00:45:58,012
I never give my word.

518
00:45:58,077 --> 00:46:00,444
It's okay.

519
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:02,418
I never make deals
with criminals either.

520
00:46:06,492 --> 00:46:08,727
- You got it.
- What?

521
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:11,666
You making deals with cops?

522
00:46:11,739 --> 00:46:14,937
And you are too.
Give her your weapon.

523
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:18,171
Everybody, give it up.

524
00:46:32,603 --> 00:46:34,807
Well, introduce us
to your friends.

525
00:46:34,908 --> 00:46:37,275
These my compadres.

526
00:46:42,492 --> 00:46:44,346
Uno must be the nice one.

527
00:46:45,724 --> 00:46:48,211
You got that right, Butchy.

528
00:46:48,283 --> 00:46:50,171
I'm not as nice as Desolation.

529
00:46:50,235 --> 00:46:52,953
And I'll cut
your fucking titties off.

530
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:55,541
Who's in charge here?

531
00:46:55,612 --> 00:46:56,985
You better let go of my arm.

532
00:46:57,050 --> 00:46:58,481
Who is in charge here?

533
00:46:58,555 --> 00:47:00,563
You! You!

534
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:04,665
Shit!

535
00:47:11,835 --> 00:47:14,421
So, you just gonna stand there
and watch her break my shit.

536
00:47:14,491 --> 00:47:15,603
Yeah.

537
00:47:15,675 --> 00:47:19,288
And now that you're done mopping
the floor, get me a beer, killer.

538
00:47:19,355 --> 00:47:20,532
What's next?

539
00:47:21,306 --> 00:47:22,800
We get more deputies.

540
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:28,503
You're deputized.

541
00:47:28,571 --> 00:47:30,546
Consider this
a martial law situation.

542
00:47:31,354 --> 00:47:32,727
Let's go.

543
00:47:39,802 --> 00:47:41,493
When did this start?

544
00:47:42,907 --> 00:47:45,754
It started a few minutes ago.

545
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:49,199
- What should we do with him?
- We can't take him with us.

546
00:47:49,275 --> 00:47:51,379
Then here he stays.

547
00:48:23,193 --> 00:48:25,616
Guys, what is that?

548
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:26,637
It's a Laffer.

549
00:48:26,713 --> 00:48:29,136
A black-market breather.

550
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:31,544
It has a 15 percent
nitrous mix.

551
00:48:31,609 --> 00:48:33,944
It gets you high?

552
00:48:34,009 --> 00:48:36,214
It turns your brain
into Swiss cheese.

553
00:48:41,689 --> 00:48:44,623
- One gross of detonators.
- What are those good for?

554
00:48:44,729 --> 00:48:47,151
It would help
if we had some dynamite...

555
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:49,112
but they make
a pretty good bang.

556
00:48:49,177 --> 00:48:52,821
We could put them in some food cans
or something, make some hand grenades.

557
00:48:52,889 --> 00:48:55,257
All right.
You got ten minutes.

558
00:49:00,249 --> 00:49:02,516
Easy.

559
00:49:02,585 --> 00:49:04,439
Here. Let me do it.

560
00:49:27,161 --> 00:49:28,949
That's beautiful.

561
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,498
That's what you get, dumb-ass.

562
00:49:36,153 --> 00:49:38,006
You're gonna be okay
to do this?

563
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:47,927
All right,
it's almost 2200 hours.

564
00:49:48,024 --> 00:49:49,877
Here's the plan,
short and simple.

565
00:49:49,975 --> 00:49:53,010
Descanso and Jericho take the lead.
Everybody else follows.

566
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:55,151
It's about 50 meters
from here to the station.

567
00:49:55,223 --> 00:49:56,718
Bashira and I are in the rear.

568
00:49:56,791 --> 00:49:58,579
Any questions?

569
00:50:03,287 --> 00:50:05,143
Put your hand down.

570
00:50:17,078 --> 00:50:19,152
All clear.

571
00:50:19,255 --> 00:50:21,109
Let's do it!

572
00:50:34,583 --> 00:50:37,266
Hey, bro, I don't see
no motherfucking train.

573
00:50:38,295 --> 00:50:39,407
Hey, lady.

574
00:50:39,479 --> 00:50:41,039
We don't see no train.

575
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:44,404
It'll be here.

576
00:50:45,463 --> 00:50:46,958
Come on. Let's go.

577
00:50:56,823 --> 00:50:57,750
That's the mine office.

578
00:51:02,582 --> 00:51:04,011
What are they doing?

579
00:51:04,086 --> 00:51:06,802
Looks like they're tearing the whole
town apart, building by building.

580
00:51:12,598 --> 00:51:14,289
Come on. Pick it up.

581
00:51:19,254 --> 00:51:20,629
Lieutenant.

582
00:51:22,358 --> 00:51:24,724
Hold your fire.
Just keep on moving.

583
00:51:29,272 --> 00:51:30,863
Go!

584
00:51:42,134 --> 00:51:43,988
- Where's the train?
- I don't know.

585
00:51:44,053 --> 00:51:46,126
You don't know? What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

586
00:51:46,198 --> 00:51:48,053
Lieutenant Ballard to the train,
come in.

587
00:51:48,117 --> 00:51:50,769
Plan A is fucked up.
You got a plan B?

588
00:51:50,838 --> 00:51:53,074
Yeah. It's the same as plan A.

589
00:51:53,172 --> 00:51:55,759
You got any fresh ideas?

590
00:51:55,861 --> 00:51:57,901
Yeah. What we should have done
in the first place.

591
00:51:59,509 --> 00:52:00,819
Shit!

592
00:52:01,077 --> 00:52:02,964
Come on,
you mindless motherfuckers!

593
00:52:42,516 --> 00:52:45,166
- Second time I saved your life.
- Run a tab.

594
00:53:15,444 --> 00:53:17,298
Jericho, grenade!

595
00:54:01,843 --> 00:54:03,699
Come on, man. On your feet.
Let's move.

596
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:07,537
Shit.

597
00:54:41,394 --> 00:54:42,287
Open that door.

598
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:59,210
We sealed the air lock doors, and
Sergeant Jericho dismantled the lock.

599
00:55:00,081 --> 00:55:03,464
They couldn't open the door
from the outside, so we were safe...

600
00:55:03,538 --> 00:55:04,911
for a while.

601
00:55:07,026 --> 00:55:08,881
Get on the radio.
Try to reach the train.

602
00:55:11,729 --> 00:55:13,105
Where's your brother?

603
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:18,633
- He didn't make it.
- Oh, God.

604
00:55:29,233 --> 00:55:31,088
Uno was your brother?

605
00:55:32,529 --> 00:55:33,641
Yeah.

606
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,575
Look at him.

607
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:16,615
Whatever is inside of him
has waited a long time to get out.

608
00:56:17,423 --> 00:56:20,588
I didn't understand their design,
how they move.

609
00:56:20,656 --> 00:56:22,117
But it's got to be the wind.

610
00:56:22,191 --> 00:56:23,915
Yeah.

611
00:56:23,984 --> 00:56:25,479
Yeah, the wind takes them.

612
00:56:25,553 --> 00:56:27,309
And then once their hosts die...

613
00:56:27,377 --> 00:56:31,238
they drift along the railroad tracks
from town to town, human to human.

614
00:56:32,209 --> 00:56:34,729
What a perfect creation.

615
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,768
Vengeance on anything or anyone that
tries to lay claim to their planet.

616
00:56:43,376 --> 00:56:45,416
What did you see
at Drucker's Ridge?

617
00:56:51,089 --> 00:56:53,902
I was at the mine when
they called a work stoppage.

618
00:56:54,991 --> 00:56:58,537
It was a Section 740,
a "scientifically significant find."

619
00:57:11,887 --> 00:57:15,270
A 740 applies to any number
of things found on Mars.

620
00:57:15,375 --> 00:57:19,150
A biological organism, an indication
of water, things like that.

621
00:57:23,471 --> 00:57:27,083
After we dynamited the mountain,
we discovered an entrance.

622
00:57:27,151 --> 00:57:30,380
It was a tunnel
carved into the rock.

623
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:33,198
it had been hidden underneath
the outer walls for centuries...

624
00:57:33,264 --> 00:57:36,557
and someone other than man
had carved it.

625
00:58:25,743 --> 00:58:27,334
Jesus!

626
00:58:29,966 --> 00:58:32,749
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know.

627
00:58:43,278 --> 00:58:45,131
Let's get the hell
out of here!

628
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:01,930
It was me.

629
00:59:01,997 --> 00:59:04,866
I opened Pandora's box.
I let them out.

630
00:59:05,453 --> 00:59:06,981
I contacted the train.

631
00:59:07,054 --> 00:59:09,539
They're about three kliks north of town
on a decoupling spur.

632
00:59:09,611 --> 00:59:11,587
- They said the tracks are blocked.
- Can they get through?

633
00:59:11,661 --> 00:59:13,734
Yeah, they're working on it.

634
00:59:19,533 --> 00:59:21,355
- You okay?
- Yes.

635
00:59:21,421 --> 00:59:23,789
- Barricaded the rear door.
- Good.

636
00:59:23,854 --> 00:59:26,755
There's a maintenance courtyard out
the back enclosed by a five-meter wall.

637
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:29,194
There's even
a Rover parked out there.

638
00:59:29,261 --> 00:59:31,682
Maybe we can make
a run for it.

639
00:59:31,757 --> 00:59:33,764
No, we wait.

640
00:59:33,837 --> 00:59:36,292
Bashira got in touch with the train.
They're coming back for us.

641
00:59:48,749 --> 00:59:51,681
Well, if a train comin',
they better hurry up.

642
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:03,657
What's the matter with you?
You did good out there.

643
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:06,882
Yeah, right.

644
01:00:07,532 --> 01:00:09,539
It's a fucked-up situation.

645
01:00:10,892 --> 01:00:13,315
I never put too much faith in cops,
but you did all right.

646
01:00:17,419 --> 01:00:18,565
You trust me?

647
01:00:18,636 --> 01:00:20,358
Hell, no.

648
01:00:20,427 --> 01:00:23,276
I really don't understand you
at all, Desolation.

649
01:00:24,012 --> 01:00:26,084
The only one looking out
for me is me.

650
01:00:26,187 --> 01:00:27,649
Doesn't that bother you?

651
01:00:27,755 --> 01:00:29,643
Nothing bothers me.

652
01:00:31,916 --> 01:00:34,053
I stopped worrying
a long time ago.

653
01:00:34,123 --> 01:00:36,196
Don't you believe in anything?

654
01:00:39,563 --> 01:00:41,570
I believe in staying alive.

655
01:00:41,643 --> 01:00:43,586
Yeah, but for what?

656
01:00:44,970 --> 01:00:47,491
Stick around.
I might let you know one day.

657
01:00:49,098 --> 01:00:49,993
When?

658
01:00:50,922 --> 01:00:53,890
When the tide is high
and the water's rising.

659
01:01:06,635 --> 01:01:08,326
Doing okay in here?

660
01:01:13,099 --> 01:01:14,307
Check this out.

661
01:01:26,793 --> 01:01:29,861
- What about it?
- It's pretty solid.

662
01:01:29,964 --> 01:01:33,191
One way in and a back door out,
leading to the rear entrance.

663
01:01:38,793 --> 01:01:42,373
- A good sturdy door.
- So what's your point?

664
01:01:42,443 --> 01:01:45,955
It's rather cozy,
don't you think?

665
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:51,170
I don't believe this.

666
01:01:51,241 --> 01:01:53,096
You lured me back here
to seduce me?

667
01:01:53,161 --> 01:01:56,673
Yeah, well, the way
things are going...

668
01:01:56,745 --> 01:01:59,616
I thought this might be
our last chance to--

669
01:01:59,690 --> 01:02:00,834
to dance.

670
01:02:04,171 --> 01:02:05,512
Yeah.

671
01:02:18,313 --> 01:02:20,702
Fuck him,
whatever the fuck he is.

672
01:02:29,546 --> 01:02:31,399
It's out of him.

673
01:02:33,417 --> 01:02:34,846
Everyone go! Get out!

674
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,941
Let's take her out back.

675
01:02:40,010 --> 01:02:42,114
What the fuck do you mean?

676
01:02:42,185 --> 01:02:43,646
We aren't moving her anywhere.

677
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:47,365
It's taking her over, man.
There's nothing we can do.

678
01:02:47,433 --> 01:02:48,839
Easy, man.

679
01:02:48,904 --> 01:02:51,838
I lost a brother in this.
That's not her.

680
01:02:55,624 --> 01:02:56,999
Come on.

681
01:03:06,633 --> 01:03:08,519
Let's put her down
before they hear us.

682
01:03:15,112 --> 01:03:16,968
This belongs to her.

683
01:03:17,992 --> 01:03:20,293
- Where did you get it?
- I stole it.

684
01:03:21,097 --> 01:03:23,268
Do you know what it is?

685
01:03:23,337 --> 01:03:24,614
It's her stash.

686
01:03:25,512 --> 01:03:28,033
This will mess
with anything in there.

687
01:03:31,847 --> 01:03:33,636
Bon voyage, Mel.

688
01:03:33,704 --> 01:03:35,560
Let's get the hell back in here.

689
01:04:53,575 --> 01:04:55,429
I will not.

690
01:05:09,862 --> 01:05:11,716
I was aware of having...

691
01:05:13,094 --> 01:05:14,468
thoughts...

692
01:05:16,006 --> 01:05:17,283
or memories.

693
01:05:17,798 --> 01:05:20,448
Like I'd been invaded
by something...

694
01:05:20,517 --> 01:05:23,235
and it was trying
to take me over.

695
01:05:23,301 --> 01:05:26,717
Something inside of me wouldn't let that
other thing take over and I fought it.

696
01:05:26,789 --> 01:05:29,888
I didn't know where I was at first,
and then it hit me.

697
01:05:29,958 --> 01:05:31,386
I was outside alone...

698
01:05:32,869 --> 01:05:34,245
unarmed.

699
01:06:57,027 --> 01:06:58,883
The back wall's been breached.

700
01:07:04,099 --> 01:07:05,953
Don't worry.
The back door's locked and secured.

701
01:07:07,427 --> 01:07:09,696
Let me in.

702
01:07:09,763 --> 01:07:12,000
It's me.

703
01:07:12,068 --> 01:07:14,107
Shit! It's Melanie!
Open the door!

704
01:07:14,179 --> 01:07:16,351
Looks like her to me.

705
01:07:16,420 --> 01:07:18,307
I haven't heard any of
these things speaking English.

706
01:07:19,715 --> 01:07:21,756
Come on, Williams. The tide's
getting high out here.

707
01:07:21,861 --> 01:07:23,866
Give me those keys.

708
01:07:23,971 --> 01:07:25,148
Come on!

709
01:07:29,731 --> 01:07:31,192
Is it you?

710
01:07:32,387 --> 01:07:33,761
Yes.

711
01:07:35,139 --> 01:07:36,513
It's me.

712
01:07:43,844 --> 01:07:45,305
I had a glimpse
of the Martians...

713
01:07:46,788 --> 01:07:49,470
of their minds,
of what they want.

714
01:07:49,539 --> 01:07:53,182
They won't rest short of the
destruction of any invading species.

715
01:07:54,466 --> 01:07:56,888
As far as they're concerned,
we are the invaders.

716
01:07:59,266 --> 01:08:01,121
Something's kicking out there.

717
01:08:09,027 --> 01:08:10,914
Shit. They made
a battering ram.

718
01:08:10,979 --> 01:08:13,346
Everybody to the rear
of the jail.

719
01:08:13,411 --> 01:08:15,265
Bashira, you and Jericho
go back to the storeroom.

720
01:08:15,331 --> 01:08:17,501
Load up on detonators.
You're the second line of defense.

721
01:08:17,569 --> 01:08:18,464
We stay here?

722
01:08:19,233 --> 01:08:21,918
We hold them off as long as we can,
then we fall back to the storeroom.

723
01:08:21,987 --> 01:08:25,760
Soon as we kill one of them, whatever
is inside is gonna come after us.

724
01:08:27,010 --> 01:08:28,024
I know.

725
01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:29,952
So if one of us gets possessed--

726
01:08:30,498 --> 01:08:31,391
Leave 'em.

727
01:09:10,369 --> 01:09:13,021
Here we go. Party time.

728
01:09:45,889 --> 01:09:47,229
- I'm out.
- I'm out.

729
01:09:53,663 --> 01:09:55,737
- Clear!
- Move! Move!

730
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:04,663
Clear!

731
01:10:14,433 --> 01:10:15,992
- Clear! Clear!
- Stand clear!

732
01:10:23,391 --> 01:10:25,018
- Clear!
- Get out!

733
01:10:38,271 --> 01:10:40,158
- I got it.
- Take them out back.

734
01:10:43,264 --> 01:10:44,541
Get out of here.

735
01:11:34,591 --> 01:11:35,998
Come on!

736
01:11:36,063 --> 01:11:37,917
Come on! Let's go!

737
01:11:57,949 --> 01:11:59,836
Look for the train. See if you
can get someone on the radio.

738
01:11:59,901 --> 01:12:02,717
Jericho, get this thing started.
Whitlock, unlock the gate.

739
01:12:10,686 --> 01:12:12,540
Come on! Hurry up!

740
01:12:15,806 --> 01:12:17,431
The train's at the station.

741
01:12:18,333 --> 01:12:21,235
- Officer to train, do you read?
- Where the hell have you been?

742
01:12:21,309 --> 01:12:24,342
- Where the hell have you been?
- All right, Bashira, come down.

743
01:12:24,413 --> 01:12:26,835
All right, wait for us.
We're on our way.

744
01:12:28,221 --> 01:12:29,596
Let's go.

745
01:12:34,973 --> 01:12:35,867
Get in!

746
01:13:17,245 --> 01:13:18,739
Get yourselves ready.

747
01:13:19,486 --> 01:13:20,378
Oh, my.

748
01:13:26,492 --> 01:13:28,826
Come on!

749
01:13:28,893 --> 01:13:31,282
Come on! Let's go!
Let's go! Come on!

750
01:13:32,316 --> 01:13:34,388
Come on!

751
01:13:34,459 --> 01:13:36,315
Okay, go! Go!

752
01:13:42,716 --> 01:13:44,058
What the hell happened to you?

753
01:13:44,124 --> 01:13:46,295
We got trapped a couple of kliks
north of here, trying to off-load.

754
01:13:46,396 --> 01:13:47,640
I'll get us out of here.

755
01:14:01,693 --> 01:14:04,026
We've got to go back.

756
01:14:04,092 --> 01:14:06,994
Slow the train down outside of town,
then come to a complete stop.

757
01:14:09,019 --> 01:14:10,394
No way.

758
01:14:11,548 --> 01:14:15,257
- I'm giving you an order.
- I don't care. The answer's no.

759
01:14:18,396 --> 01:14:20,218
The answer's yes.

760
01:14:21,660 --> 01:14:23,415
Look...

761
01:14:23,483 --> 01:14:28,698
even if we get back to Chryse,
those things will just keep coming.

762
01:14:28,763 --> 01:14:30,618
We've got a chance here.

763
01:14:32,058 --> 01:14:34,742
We've got a chance to stop this thing
before it goes any further.

764
01:14:35,324 --> 01:14:37,778
This is about one thing--

765
01:14:37,851 --> 01:14:39,226
dominion.

766
01:14:40,539 --> 01:14:42,448
It's not their planet anymore.

767
01:14:43,323 --> 01:14:44,849
What about him?

768
01:14:44,922 --> 01:14:47,345
Isn't it our job
to take him back?

769
01:14:49,658 --> 01:14:52,114
Is he still a prisoner
or is he one of us?

770
01:14:53,787 --> 01:14:56,404
I can give a damn
about saving this planet.

771
01:14:57,466 --> 01:15:00,532
Seems like it's been after me
since the day I was born.

772
01:15:02,330 --> 01:15:05,014
If I'm gonna die,
I'm gonna die fighting...

773
01:15:05,083 --> 01:15:06,840
not running.

774
01:15:20,090 --> 01:15:23,090
If we blew up the nuclear
power station, what would happen?

775
01:15:23,194 --> 01:15:25,168
I mean, there'd be
a huge explosion, right?

776
01:15:25,274 --> 01:15:28,373
No, not unless you retract
the control rods and expose the core.

777
01:15:28,442 --> 01:15:29,815
Then what?

778
01:15:31,258 --> 01:15:34,553
Then you'd have a small
atomic bomb going "boom."

779
01:15:36,570 --> 01:15:37,464
How small?

780
01:15:39,129 --> 01:15:42,262
I don't know. It'd blow out
a radius of a mile, maybe two.

781
01:15:46,617 --> 01:15:47,960
Would it kill them?

782
01:15:48,026 --> 01:15:50,393
It would certainly destroy
their human hosts, but as for them...

783
01:15:51,641 --> 01:15:52,754
I don't know.

784
01:15:56,473 --> 01:15:58,613
Jericho, can you get us in?

785
01:16:00,282 --> 01:16:01,654
I can try.

786
01:16:17,049 --> 01:16:18,839
The plan was simple.

787
01:16:18,906 --> 01:16:21,622
Sergeant Jericho, the science officer
and I jumped off the train...

788
01:16:21,689 --> 01:16:23,829
and headed towards
the powerplant.

789
01:16:23,898 --> 01:16:27,410
The others stayed aboard the train
as it backed into the station.

790
01:16:27,513 --> 01:16:29,335
The idea was they provide cover...

791
01:16:29,401 --> 01:16:32,946
and distract the Martians
as we set the charges in the plant.

792
01:16:33,016 --> 01:16:35,057
And they'd swing back, pick us up
and we'd all get as far away...

793
01:16:35,130 --> 01:16:37,267
from Shining Canyon as we could
before the place blew.

794
01:16:37,337 --> 01:16:39,704
Like I said,
it was a simple plan.

795
01:16:40,729 --> 01:16:43,249
The only problem was, it didn't work
the way it was supposed to.

796
01:16:50,937 --> 01:16:53,392
- How are you doing,Jericho?
- I'm working on it.

797
01:16:53,465 --> 01:16:54,578
Hurry up.

798
01:17:09,239 --> 01:17:12,851
We've got to remove the waterjacket
and destroy the containment shell.

799
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:14,382
Where do I put the dynamite?

800
01:17:29,945 --> 01:17:33,589
Officer to the train, they've
spotted us. Get your ass back here now.

801
01:18:35,287 --> 01:18:36,268
Yeah?

802
01:19:16,277 --> 01:19:17,652
Let's go.

803
01:20:03,093 --> 01:20:04,466
We've got to get out
of here fast.

804
01:20:04,533 --> 01:20:06,986
The Doc says the blast radius
could be up to two miles.

805
01:20:07,060 --> 01:20:09,232
- What does that mean?
- It means step on it.

806
01:20:30,004 --> 01:20:31,859
Stay here and keep it
full throttle.

807
01:20:31,923 --> 01:20:33,234
What are you gonna do?

808
01:20:33,301 --> 01:20:34,990
Lighten our load.

809
01:20:37,620 --> 01:20:40,008
I think there's some
more dynamite in the rear car.

810
01:22:58,353 --> 01:23:00,525
See you later,
you big motherfucker.

811
01:23:29,808 --> 01:23:30,921
You okay?

812
01:23:31,697 --> 01:23:32,591
Say your prayers.

813
01:24:06,352 --> 01:24:09,069
I didn't know
you was cut this deep.

814
01:24:10,191 --> 01:24:13,258
Should've taken care
of this hours ago.

815
01:24:13,904 --> 01:24:16,269
You do that like a pro.

816
01:24:16,336 --> 01:24:17,644
Yeah.

817
01:24:17,711 --> 01:24:20,101
Me and my brother
been through a lot of battles...

818
01:24:21,327 --> 01:24:23,269
ever since we was kids.

819
01:24:26,544 --> 01:24:29,259
I never thought I'd go to war
with somebody like you.

820
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:34,184
I know when you get to Chryse, you'll
tell those people that I helped you...

821
01:24:35,215 --> 01:24:37,802
and I wasn't the cause
of all this mess around here.

822
01:24:38,929 --> 01:24:41,863
'Cause I know they're looking
for somebody to blame.

823
01:24:41,936 --> 01:24:44,357
I swear to you, Williams...

824
01:24:44,431 --> 01:24:48,260
as soon as I get back, I'm gonna tell my
superiors about this fucked-up planet.

825
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:51,977
They'll drop the charges
as soon as they get the report.

826
01:24:59,055 --> 01:25:00,943
That ought to hold it.

827
01:25:01,039 --> 01:25:03,046
When you get there,
have somebody look at it.

828
01:25:04,110 --> 01:25:07,494
I couldn't get it perfect,
so it might leave a scar.

829
01:25:07,567 --> 01:25:08,843
I'm getting a collection.

830
01:25:08,911 --> 01:25:10,918
You'll be all right.

831
01:25:14,223 --> 01:25:16,077
- Comfortable?
- Yeah.

832
01:25:17,647 --> 01:25:19,501
I'll get you a blanket.

833
01:25:30,223 --> 01:25:32,165
What the hell are you doing?

834
01:25:32,814 --> 01:25:34,669
Oh, this is where I get off.

835
01:25:34,734 --> 01:25:36,807
What are you talking about?

836
01:25:36,877 --> 01:25:40,652
We'll be in Chryse soon.
Can't let you turn me in.

837
01:25:42,542 --> 01:25:44,397
I can't let you walk.

838
01:25:48,845 --> 01:25:51,562
What you gonna do,
fucking shoot me?

839
01:25:59,533 --> 01:26:00,843
There's nowhere to run.

840
01:26:04,077 --> 01:26:06,085
Anywhere is better than hell.

841
01:26:09,006 --> 01:26:10,860
Catch you later.

842
01:26:14,126 --> 01:26:15,980
Yeah, right.

843
01:26:22,925 --> 01:26:24,300
Shit.

844
01:26:31,694 --> 01:26:33,896
And what happened to Williams?

845
01:26:33,998 --> 01:26:35,404
I don't know.

846
01:26:35,470 --> 01:26:37,292
When I woke up, he was gone.

847
01:26:37,357 --> 01:26:38,600
And you were handcuffed?

848
01:26:39,724 --> 01:26:41,580
Must've done it
while I slept.

849
01:26:42,605 --> 01:26:44,460
At that point,
I trusted him.

850
01:26:46,348 --> 01:26:48,323
That's all you have to tell us?

851
01:26:49,133 --> 01:26:50,987
That's all I know.

852
01:26:52,204 --> 01:26:55,653
All right, Lieutenant Ballard,
I suggest you get some rest.

853
01:26:55,726 --> 01:26:57,580
You're dismissed.

854
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:14,372
Is our statement to the Cartel going to
be that Mars is being overrun by ghosts?

855
01:27:38,668 --> 01:27:40,556
Attention, all police personnel...

856
01:27:40,652 --> 01:27:42,888
report to your nearest
munitions station immediately...

857
01:27:42,956 --> 01:27:44,614
for weaponry assignment.

858
01:27:44,684 --> 01:27:47,586
A security breach has occurred
in the south quadrant.

859
01:27:47,659 --> 01:27:50,561
This is a level-ten emergency.

860
01:27:50,635 --> 01:27:55,208
All police personnel, report to your
division sergeant for assignment.

861
01:27:55,276 --> 01:27:58,593
All civilian personnel,
evacuate the streets immediately.

862
01:27:58,668 --> 01:28:01,319
Please remain indoors
until further instructed.

863
01:28:14,795 --> 01:28:15,689
Come on.

864
01:28:17,644 --> 01:28:20,708
Tide is up.
Time to stay alive.

865
01:28:31,946 --> 01:28:35,743
If you ever wanna come to the other
side, you'd make a hell of a crook.

866
01:28:35,819 --> 01:28:37,673
You'd make a hell of a cop.

867
01:28:40,235 --> 01:28:41,696
Let's just kick some ass.
